We're going with 'it was cooked', are we? That was my first ever Christmas dinner! It was great. I didn't know you could cook. There's lots of things you don't know about me, James Hughes. Stay there. Stay there! [James grunts] Okay, just one. That camera! You're such an old man! Well, this old man... - ...got you something. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - We said no presents. - I know, I know! - No presents, remember? - But... Well, just open it when... you're really missing me. I'll be really missing you, will I? I really wish I could come with you. Why don't you? - What? - Come with me. We could have Christmas in the countryside together. I mean... my mum would kill me. [announcer over PA] Macclesfield calling at Luton... That's me. Bloody Macclesfield. - Bloody 'Kimble'. - Kemble! Whatever! I have been wanting to say that these past couple of months have been... Well, you're like... the coolest person I've ever met, and I don't even just mean on the course. Like, ever and... - You are out of time, James Hughes. - Well, no... I just... I wanna say... I... I love... Bye! Bye! [announcer over PA] ...the 17:32 service to Kemble. Calling at Reading... Okay! [whistle blowing] - Come on, darling. - Wait! Have you got your ticket? [mumbling] You're going to spend Christmas together! That's lovely! Your ticket? Sorry, I... Is this free? - Yes, love. - Cheers. Someone who knows you well, eh? I told you! Stop talking to random people. Wait! This stops at Kimble, right? Kemble. Even better! Does this stop at Macclesfield? It does, love. Excellent!

There speaks someone with little comprehension of the South West Rail Network. Right. Right then. Right. I just need to find James' house. You know where everyone lives, right? Because this is the countryside you're going to assume everyone knows everyone else? His name's Hughes. James Hughes? Yeah, of course I know that one. It's up the hill, past Chapman's house, turn right at June's cottage, past the church, down the drive and, well, can't miss it. Right, ta!

Mum! Mum, don't listen to him! Gilet gave us that tenner. We didn't mug him, honest. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who is Gilet? He is. He's our mate. - What? - Hello, Gilet. Is that French? Well, I suppose the word 'gilet' is, but I'm... Are you not a little bit too old to be hanging out with my boys? I'm nine and three quarters! - He's a pervert. - I just... - He's not! - ...bumped into them in an alleyway. - And you gave them a tenner? - He's a drug dealer! No, he's our mate. - Stop saying that. - [Geoff] I'm back! - Right, positions! Positions! - Where are we going? What are we doing? What's going on? We're surprising Hayley! Great! Okay. That's... You're squeezing me a bit tight. Careful, that's my... Surprise! - Merry Christmas! - No. No. No, no. - No. - Where's Hayley? - Geoff? - She didn't show. It's bloody freezing out there! I've got nipples like a '99 flake. There's a heavy snow on the way, Geoff. - I forgot my coat, didn't I? - Well, did you call her? - No, my phone's in my coat. - What are you doing back here then? Getting my bloody coat, aren't I? [Granddad] Heading up from the South. - You must be shattered. Get that bag off. - It's fine. - Have you been flogging turkeys? - No. But if I was... I would just have made a hundred quid! Hey! Whoa-ho! - Get some music on. - You had one job. What are you on about? I've had loads of jobs, all pigging day. - I was delivering turkeys till five! - Unbelievable! Right, boys, upstairs, go get yourselves cleaned up. Remember, snitches get stitches. And tell-tales get... e-mails! How many times do we lose this bloody remote? - Hi. - Who the bloody hell are you? He's either a drug dealer or a pervert. I'm not. Or both. This is Gilet, Geoff. He's friends with the boys. Again, I'm not. Them kids! How many times have I got to tell you two, eh? Hang around with lads your own age! - [boy] I'm nine and three quarters! - Exactly! Right. No offence, Gilet, but come on. He can stay for a quick Christmas drink, surely? - It's fine. - What other jobs you have to do, Geoff? - Don't worry Granddad. I got the stuffing. - Come and have a seat with me. It's gone to voicemail. It never goes to voicemail. Love... Cup of tea, Gilet? Oh, God! That sounds exotic. I've come across plenty of Lees and Darrens in my time. You can say that again! But I can't say I've ever met another 'Gilet'. It's a body warmer, Kaye. TK Maxx is full of 'em. - You should go and look for her. - I'll be back in a minute. Look, Kath, let's give it half an hour, right? We'll have a cuppa. If we've not heard from her by then... Okay, we'll give it exactly half an hour and then you'll go and look for her. What, no cuppa? No cuppa. Kath... [Kath] Honestly, one of these days I'm gonna give you a simple task and you're gonna get it right! Come on, it's Christmas Eve Eve. I'm James. Hello! You must be Peanut. Ohh! Okay, alright. Chill, chill, Peanut. Peanut! - [clicking tongue] - Like I said, very casual. Thank you, Iris. You may leave. Will you please put that down? Sorry, it's just... That's Tony Blair, right? And isn't that... The first thing to establish when you are in my house: that you respect my privacy. Oh, right. - Sorry. - And the second is the importance of punctuality. Erm, look, I don't want to get off on the back foot. I'm Hayley. Taylor. Humphrey Hughes. And you get off on the wrong foot, not the back foot. Yeah, course, but... right now I feel like I'm doing a bit of both. Yes, well, take a seat. It has been something of an inauspicious start. We had been told good things. - Oh, really? - Yes. - Dependable, experienced, cheap. - What? And your background checks were clear. Back... background checks? Standard procedure. You should have been informed. Look, I don't know what James has told you about me, but... - James? - Yes. James. Your son? - Tony Blair's ball boy. - My son's name is Hubert James Hughes, and he is currently away training. And I am a little confused as to how you know him. Sorry, did you just say his name's 'Hubert'? How do you know my son? We're on the same course. You train with Hubert? No, I train with James. Well, where is he? Well, I don't know. I was gonna ask you the same thing. Is he not here... Excuse me, sir. This is Doris. I'm here about the cleaning job. Bit late, I know, but my... cat died. Er... Iris, I will, er, conduct the interview in my study. Very well. Come with me. [Hayley] Wow! You thought I was the cleaner. Because I had an interview with a cleaner at 7:00 pm, and at twenty past seven you knocked on my door. Look, I'm going to have to deal with that. Won't take long. She's clearly not right. You will stay here until I return. Understood? - Yes, sir! - And don't touch anything. [Humphrey] Come on, Peanut! Come on, boy. I'm sorry, you don't have a phone I could borrow? I left mine on the... [door closes firmly] So I know she got on her train. But did she get off it? I know I did, 'cause I'm here. But Hayley's not. And that begs the question... where is she? You say something, young man? Never mind. [Geoff] She missed her train, that's all. [Kath] Yes and now she's walking the streets! [Geoff] Well, she'll be alright. I thought, you know what, it's Christmas, screw the brew. Have I introduced myself properly? I'm Kaye. You can call me Special K! I'm Ant and Dec's aunty. Ant and Dec? Oh, Gilet! You still here? I offered him a drink. Kaye, quick word. What flavour stuffing you get? Cranberry and chestnut, Grandad. Now didn't we have a box of choccies knocking about? Er, what are you doing, love? I think he likes me. Look, we don't know him, and he is very young. A minute ago, he was too old. For Ant and Dec. [laughs] Oh, Kath! I'm a cougar these days. It's very on trend. Come on, sis, it's just a bit of Christmas fun! [Geoff] Could have sworn we had some Maltesers on the go! Ohh. I wonder how they got there, eh? Kath was just saying, you can always stop for your tea. Really? Oh, God! Completely forgot. Go and check the lasagne. - No, it's fine. - That's me. I should probably take this. Do you have somewhere... private? Like a study or... Kitchen's through there. Okay, yeah. Thank you. - [chuckling] - [whispering] Study? [clears throat] - Dad, listen... - [Hayley] Hello, 'Hubert'. - Hayley? - [whispering] Surprise! Where the hell are you? What are you doing in my house? I got on your train. I don't know what I was thinking. Well, I do know what I was thinking. I was thinking it would be epic romantic. But then you weren't here, and it was actually horrifically awkward. And now I'm stuck here, I've lost my phone, and outside it's starting to look like the North Pole. Have you said anything about me? No! And your house! You said you lived in a cottage, not a bloody castle! Okay, yes, well, I-I may have done some downplaying. James, there's a picture of your dad with Prince Charles. Yeah, okay, erm... Okay, here we go. My dad's official title is Lord Humphrey Manningham-Hughes. - Lord? - Well, he's an Earl. The Earl of Gloucester, to be precise. Are you joking? I know, I should have told you, I know. But, look, I need you to not say anything... James, are you a frickin' Royal? No! No! Well, technically, yes. But I'm like... I'm like, 300th in line to the throne or something, okay? Like, put it this way, a lot of people would have to croak - for my character to turn up in The Crown. - I can't cope with this. But, Hayley, this is important: my dad, he doesn't know about... - [smoke alarm beeping] - I don't believe it! Oh gosh, oh gosh! How do you turn your oven off? My oven? Wait, what? What? I told you to check the lasagne! - Alright, don't panic! - What is going on? - It's... - Is the house on fire? - No, no, no! - What are you doing, James? Is this some sort of a joke? James... what the hell are you doing in my house? What you said: Epic. Romantic. James, I need you to listen to me. They do not know about you yet. Have you said anything? No. I mean, I haven't really been able to get a word in edgeways. James, I need you to do me the world's biggest favour and not say anything. Okay. I mean, may I ask why? I'll explain when I see you, and I promise we will laugh about it afterwards. What am I supposed to say? Just say I'll be home tomorrow or something. We're drama students. Improvise. You know how bad I am at impro! Whenever I get stuck, I do that weird Scottish accent. Well, now's your time to get good, fast! I've got to go. Hayley, no! Hayley. [sighs] Okay. [huffs] Impro. [chuckles] [noisy commotion] Excuse me. [commotion settles] I have a wee thing to tell ya. Your Lordship. Er, that was James. - Hubert. - Yeah, Hubert. Erm, he said that his train's been delayed, but he will be back tomorrow. Right. And you are here... for what reason exactly? Do you know what? It's actually quite a funny story... Er, but probably for another time. I'm just on my way up North, and I thought I'd nip in, say hi to a mate. But he's clearly not here, so I will just be heading off. - Safe travels. - Out of the question. I'm sorry, sir, but it's too late for her to travel in this tonight. Besides the last train will have left by now. Hubert's room's made up already. - She could stay there. - Er... Oh... very well. Erm, Iris will call a cab for you in the morning. Early. Thank you, My Lord. Come on, Peanut! - Come on! - Come along. Getting the tour, am I? That's Mr Hughes' study. And through there is the main hall, and beyond that there's the conservatory, the kitchen, and the library's upstairs. Wow! You're only a billiard room away from a full Cluedo board. That's beyond the conservatory on the right. I'm gonna get killed with a lead pipe in the drawing room, aren't I? I sincerely hope not. The drawing room is strictly out of bounds. Besides, there is no drawing room on a Cluedo board. Oh, wow! This one looks just like James. If he went full hipster. That's the First Earl of Gloucester. Fought alongside King Charles. This family has a proud military history. It's produced field marshals at Waterloo, generals in the Boer. Hubert's great-great-grandfather was in the Somme. His great-grandfather fought with Montgomery. And of course, Mr Hughes' own record in Afghanistan and Iraq speaks for itself. Wow! So how does everyone feel about Hubert? - Very proud. - Really? As I'm sure your parents are of you. The officer training course at Sandhurst is... Well, it produces the best soldiers in the world. Sandhurst? You did say you were on the same course, didn't you? Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, we are. Sorry. Sorry, it's been a long day. Let me show you your bedroom. Here you are. Supper will be in the main hall at nine. And try and wear something a little more... Not... not that. - [Nan] Looks like... - [Grandad] I love lasagne! I've got to say, losing her phone and missing her train is such a Hayley thing to do. Still don't know why she didn't call me, though. [Geoff] Here you go! Geoff, what have you got those out for? Gives Gilet a chance to get to know us quicker. 'James' is fine. Oh! Who put that there? - You did. - We had 'em made for Hayley's 21st. Who is he again? Hayley's friend from drama school, Mum! His train got cancelled at Macclesfield, so H texted him saying he could crash here for the night. - Shagging, are they? - Whoa! - Of course not, Mum! Bloody hell! - Oh, God, no. I'm... I'm very much single. Really? And gay. - Really? - Aye. I am just a wee bit into my men, it's true. Oh, cool! Who would you rather snog, Ronaldo or Messi? That's Ronaldo, any day of the week. Right, Gilet? I'm a Lionel Messi man myself. Such a low centre of gravity. So, er, Ant and Dec, are those your real names? [Geoff] Oh, God, here we go! Right, so, Dad is Antony, and then Geoff's dad was Declan. Do you know what? It wasn't until we'd done it that we even realised. Not that we're not big fans of the presenters. Cracking chemistry. Do you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna put this here, so that Hayley... is here in spirit. She's in London, Kath. She's not dead. She's such a worrier these days. [soft chuckle] Can't imagine what you were like when she got her tattoo. Tattoo? I mean... if... if she got a tattoo, just to imagine what you'd be like. H would tell me if she got a tattoo, wouldn't she? Yeah. Well, I never told anybody when I got mine. Do you get to eat in here every night? Most evenings I enjoy supper in my study. Alone. Right. Must be fun being a lord. I try not to use the title, where possible. Really? If it was me, I'd be using it all the time! 'Her Lordship's coming through!' Straight to the front of the queue at H&M. 'Out the way, people, Her Lordship needs a new boob tube.' [chuckles] So what are your plans for Christmas? We tend not to make a fuss of Christmas in this house. Oh, but come on, the fuss is the best bit! And you could get a massive Christmas tree in here! Like, my house is tiny, but you should see it at Christmas. Man alive, like, we have Advent candles, Advent calendars, we even have this, like, Advent toilet roll that's got, like, the Christmas cracker jokes on it. And my mum! She has this musical reindeer. It's like... ♪ Jingle bells! Jingle... ♪ Ugh! It drives everybody nuts. And... [scoffs] Tonight, my nan, she makes these, like, Christmas pudding muffins, and if you find the one with the coin baked in it, you don't have to do any chores for the whole of Crimbo. I just think every home should have a Christmas tree, that's all. Well, you won't see many Christmases at home... once you get your commission. Sorry? Once you're an officer. You won't get home very often. Well, all depends, sir. If I get in the LANCS Regiment, like I hope, then I'll be just up the road. The LANCS? Well, don't they refer to themselves as the... Mmm. The Lions Of England, yeah. Or the Kingsmen, if you prefer. As someone who never really had a choice, I'm curious, why did you choose the army as a career? Mmm. Much like James, actually. My dad was a massive influence. He served? He served a lot, yeah. Ice... Icy conditions were his speciality. But... very secretive. We're not really allowed to talk about it. That sounds like the Mountain Troop. Yes, that's the one, but you didn't hear it from me. Ninety-Nine Regiment. SAS arctic survival experts. Yes, I've seen what those boys can do in the mountains of Afghanistan. Your father must be an impressive physical specimen. Oh, yes, sir. He really keeps himself in shape. [laughter] That hit the spot, eh? - What was I saying? - Turkey Trot. Oh, yeah. So, it was this half marathon, right? And they do it every Saturday before Crimbo, and they call it the Turkey Trot. Because every finisher gets a turkey. - The race starts at 9:00 am, right? - Yeah. He comes home at 2:30, and he's carrying... A frozen bloody chicken! It had taken him that long to get round, they'd run out of turkeys! Chicken for Christmas dinner? - I'll never live it down! - That's for you. - Thank you. - Right! - Let's see who's got the golden ticket. - Oh, yeah, Gilet. You find the ten-pence piece, and you're chore-free, eh? In my day, it was a sixpence. - I think it's stuck. - I think someone's found the 10p. Man! I hate doing the dishes! - He doesn't even live here. Rematch! - Is he alright? - He's choking. - Bloody no! That's real! You alright, mate? You know, a sixpence was much smaller. - Is he going to die? - It would've slipped right through. - Stay there. Turn round. - No, boys! No, don't film! - Put your cameras away. - Stay with me! Geoff! What are you doing? I'm doing the Heimlich manoeuvre! And how many first-aid courses have you done at work? Out of the way, out of the way, out of the way. Turn! [Dec] Dramatic! No washing up for me this year. You alright? - Are you alright? - How about that for drama, eh?

Old Dowder's still there. The old ball-breaker. Except he isn't. And he never was. There is, however, a Colonel Crosby who informed me that my son discharged himself after only three days. He'd been led to believe it was with my blessing. And of course, he'd never heard of you, which I can't say is a surprise. Why? 'Cause people like me don't get to be army officers? Precisely. You're asthmatic. And quite clearly a performer. Much more suited to the drama course at the Guildhall School of Performing Arts. Unlike my son. I see, so you've been running more background checks? We've always ensured that this family has served its country, and I have a right to know if my son has abandoned his duty. So, perhaps you'd like to explain to me exactly what is going on. Maybe you should talk to James about that, not me. I just wanna go away and be with my family. This has been... really weird! Merry Christmas. Ohh. Kicked you out already, has he? No surprise there. [distant horn honks repeatedly] I've never really been one for emotional goodbyes, so, erm... - Thanks, Geoff. - Yeah. Sorry it couldn't have been a longer stay. Let's be honest, mate, if you stuck round any longer on Christmas Eve, it would've been weird. No one really wanted that. The 8:33 to Hull on platform three - has been cancelled. - Glad I'm not going to Hull. Aren't we all, lad? We apologise for the inconvenience this may cause you. - Bloody hell! - The train to London Euston has now been cancelled. We are sorry for the disruption to your service. The 8:59 from platform one calling at Reading, Swindon... Oh, you're kidding me! Your attention, please. Due to the adverse weather conditions all services from this station are now suspended. Please remain calm. I repeat, please remain calm. Looks like we're spending another night at my mother's. Ohh, shit! Shit! My sentiments exactly, dear. Come on! Hello? I've just had the worst night of my life. - Where are you? - I'm at the station. And I guess my dad knows about drama school then? Only after I spent all night pretending I was G.I. bloody Jane. - I tried to tell you. - Yeah. When exactly? I mean, you've had two months and you actually haven't told me anything. I'll be honest, right now, I feel like I don't even know you. - Okay, hang on. - I can't hang on! I'm on a real-life payphone. I had to ask the weird old station master to show me how it worked. Look, I really wanted to tell you, but I didn't know how you were gonna react, - and then it just felt like... - I thought we could trust each other. Well, yeah, you certainly trusted me to lie to your parents about us. Do not try and deflect this on to me. Come on, there's loads of things you haven't told me too. Like what? Like, you're a magician! You are an Earl. You went to Eton. You are going to inherit an estate! If you can't be honest with me, at least be honest with yourself. You hunt! What did you just call me? Hello? Hop in, Gilet! Any chance of a coffee? I think we can do better than that. There you are. That should warm you up. Thanks. I always have a glass of sherry with my nan on Christmas Eve when we have a pamper. - Cheers. - Cheers. Let's call it breakfast. [Hayley chuckles] Thanks for letting me back in. I didn't really know where else to go. I'm so glad it was you that answered the door. Oh... well, yes. I'd apologise for his behaviour if I could, but, unfortunately, that's not in my job description. It appears that over the last few years he's forgotten how to treat our guests. Still, not to worry. Today's one of the few days he goes out. And he won't be back till much later, so, perhaps by then your trains will be up and running again. Is that James' mum? Fiona, yes. She passed away, didn't she? Four years ago now. James never really wants to talk about it. [sucks teeth] Like father, like son. All you need to know is it wasn't always like this. No, there was a time when this house was full of fun and laughter. Especially at Christmas. They used to love Christmas. Oh, Fiona and Mr Hughes had great plans. They were going to host wedding parties, even a music festival. - No way! - Yeah. Gloucestonbury. It would have been quite a weekend. - [Hayley chuckles softly] - Oh, anyway. I better get going. My list won't 'to do' itself. So... stay as long as you like. - Make yourself at home. - Thanks. Just don't read my diaries. And if you do go out, make sure that dog stays inside. He's a runner. I can think of plenty of other words for him. Oh, Peanut's alright. Like a lot of people round here, his bark is far worse than his bite. [chorus] ♪ O, tidings of comfort and joy ♪ ♪ Comfort and joy ♪ ♪ O, tidings of comfort and joy ♪ [Geoff groans] [groans] Yeah, the boys will be delighted you're back, Gilet. They've taken a real shine to you. Get him! Get him, get him! Quick, get him in the face! Aah! Stop! Dec! - Not in the face! Ow! - Yes! The cold weather sweeping in from Siberia... There weren't any rocks in the ones they threw at me. - I'm sure it was an accident. - Yeah. - Put some ice on it, love. - Yeah. - Okay. - You'll survive, lad. I know. - Them kids, eh? - Right, what we gonna do? Sneak out the back door and ambush them from the rear? About Hayley being stuck in the hell hole. Oh, the trains'll be up and running soon enough. Well... She wouldn't want us to cancel our Christmas Eve just 'cause her train's delayed. We owe it to her to crack on with tradition. - Boys to the pub! - Girls have a pamper! Exactly! It's what Hayley would have wanted. Right, we're off to The Tuns. We'll set up the home spa! Get slicing those cucumbers, Gladys. Do it yourself. I'm watching the news. It's not going to be the same without Hayley. We need it to be the four of us. Oh, Gilet can take her place! Why don't you stay with us and have a pamper with the girls? I'm sorry, what's happening now? Yeah, you could fill us in on what she's been up to! No, he's coming to the pub with me and Granddad! I do not think that The Tuns is the sort of place that Gilet would like to go to, Geoff. The pub'll be no fun for you. It's all Guinness and football, and 'Fairytale of New York'. I mean, that doesn't sound not fun. I do enjoy a drop of Guinness now and again. Looks like you haven't got a choice, pal. Anthony, we're leaving a good man behind, but desperate times call for desperate measures. - Onwards, Christian soldier! - ♪ Onwards, Christian soldier... ♪ Hey, don't wait up!

I'm just getting the dog. You expect me to believe that? You are scrumping. Scrumping for my apples. Who sent you? Magners? Bulmers? You city folk will never be able to make cider like us, and do you know why? - Pomace. - Pomace? Well, don't worry. I'm not here for your pomace. - It's good pomace. - No, I bet it is, whatever it is, but I'm not here for your cider. I'm just here to make sure this stupid dog doesn't get killed by your electric fence. Pull the other one! Everyone round here knows this fence isn't turned on. See? [shotgun blast] [thud] [whispers] Oh, my... Oh, my God! [whispers] Oh, my God! [soft groan] [laughter] That's enough from us though, Gilet. It's time for you to start dishing the dirt. Oh, yeah. Come on, tell us how our girl's getting on. Well, okay. Well... She's... I mean... I mean, she's great. She works hard, she plays hard. - Mm-hmm. - She's... She's actually been spending a lot of time with this guy on her course. - They seem to be getting on very well. - Oh? Mm. Yeah, can't seem to get enough of each other. They always make each other laugh. It seems great. From the outside. Well, well, well! Hayley Taylor, juggling her men! I knew I'd be a positive influence on my girl. - Juggling? - No. No, she would not do that to Steve. Who's Steve? ♪ We three kings of Orient are!

I've sent all your presents to the barracks! Aw, you shouldn't have. Listen, I managed to wrangle a few days' leave last minute. The Lions Of England are without their chief Kingsman till New Year's! [joyous shouts] We bumped into him on the way home, just in time for Christmas Eve games! Christmas Steve games! Now when H gets back, Steve will be waiting for her! - I mean, it's perfect. - Perfect. Wait, who is... who is Steve? You? Who are you? You must be the mysterious visitor I've heard so much about. Puffer Jacket? Yeah. It's Gilet. Here you go, Steve-O. Stick that one on. I'm not too sure this'll fit anymore. [clicks tongue] Been hitting the gym. Fiancé? Surely Hayley told you about Steve? No. No, she-she didn't. Funnily enough. Yeah, that is funny. Yeah, yeah, erm... Very funny. You alright, Gilet? You look like you've swallowed another coin. Are you sure you're engaged? Just a bit, mate. [chuckles] Well, um... congratulations. Yeah, you're right, Geoff. He is a bit weird. You're telling me! - I've got to... I've got to go. - What, get ready for games night? No... - I've just really gotta go. - What? Well, you can't go now. I've just sorted the teams! You're with me and the olds. Steve, you're with this lot. - Let the battle commence! - Hey-hey-hey! I hate games night. [door opens] Mr Hughes! You're back. Wait. What are you doing in there? That room is strictly out of bounds! Oh, Mr Hughes, erm, wait a minute. Sorry, I just need to tell... Did you do this? Mmm. Why did you do this? I just thought I'd surprise you. Like I said, every home should have a tree at Christmas. Where's Peanut? Okay, so that was something I wanted to talk to you about. What are you doing down here? Right, well... Why have you put a hat on my dog? - Come here, boy. - Mr Hughes, let me explain. What the bloody hell? It's just a scratch. - Let's have a look at it. - Shotgun went off. I was on his land, and it's my fault. I don't want to hear it! Now just get out of my sight, both of you! Alright, boy. Let's get this silly bandage off, shall we? - Mr Hughes... - How dare you put my dog in danger! He's in shock, but he's alright. I think you just need to chill out a bit. Don't tell me to chill out! You have no right to come into my house and start interfering! Rearranging and touching her things! Oh, Mr Hughes, I'm so sorry. I didn't think. Well, you should have. Now just leave us alone! [low] Sorry, lad. [sighs] Okay. Me and Hayley first hit it off behind a... - Burger King! - Come on! First holiday I came on with you guys. The best ever. Devon. No, uh, Greece. Wait! Spain! ¡Si, Senorita! [celebratory shouts] - How good was that holiday? - Come on, come on! Next one, next one, next one, next one! I smashed my PB at this last year. - Iron Man! - Yes! [celebratory shouts] Go on! Of course, he's done an Iron Man. What you ever done, eh, Puffer Jacket? A feather man? [laughter] A sponge boy? [laughter] I'm only messing with you, lad. Listen, you're up. You're gonna be with... Nan. Right! - Okay. - Come on, Mum, here we go! Go! Swedish band. Eurovision. Nan? Coldplay? 'Waterloo'? 'Dancing Queen'? I've said Coldplay! 'Mamma Mia'. Come on, think about it! Time! - Unbelievable. - Yes! I bloody hate Coldplay. And that's another big fat zero for Puffer Jacket. Call me Puffer Jacket one more time! - Ohh! - Gilet, it's only Christmas games. - This has been going on all night. - What are you gonna do about it? Puffer Jacket! I don't know, Steve. Maybe we should take it outside? - Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! - Boys, boys! Boys, boys! There's not going to be a fight. - Batter him, Steve! - Mum! Gilet, that's the cider talking, right? - No offence but Steve here... - In the army, yes, I gathered. Well, I've got level two stage combat, so bring it on. That's the landline. Nobody ever rings the landline. - Hello? - Hey, Mum. Oh, it's Hayley! Hayley, love, where are you? - Don't worry, Mum. I'm on my way home. - Oh, thank God for that! Are you... Are you playing games? You know us, love. Christmas Eve games. I'm so sorry I'm not home yet, Mum. - It's not your fault, love. - No, it is. I thought I was... I don't know what I thought. But believe me, Mum, there is nowhere else in the world that I would rather be than at home with you. I know, love, I know. And there is somebody else here who can't wait to see you! I'll pass you on to him! James? Guess again! Steve?! What the hell are you doing there? I can't wait to see you too, darling. We're through. We're through. I told you months ago. Yeah, well, your family don't know that, do they? How much she's missing you. - [all] Aww. - I was waiting to tell them. Anyway, that is none of your business. You're not supposed to be there at all, you massive weirdo! Yeah. Yeah. Oh, God! Is James still there? - Let me talk to her. - I've met James. Yeah. - Lovely fella. - Let me speak to her. Steve, get out of there now, you freak. You've got no right! - This isn't fair. Steve... - She had to go. - I want to talk to her. - You can't. - Yes, I can. - No, you can't. Yes, I can! I'm telling you, you can't! - Geoff! - Hey! - She's my girlfriend! - No, she's mine! - Not... now! - Gilet! At least, I thought she was mine. - What? - Why else do you think I'm here? I didn't miss my train. I came to spend Christmas with the girl I love. - Hang on, you said you were... - I'm not gay! I'm just a really good actor. What about Ronaldo? Next thing he'll be telling us he's not called Gilet. I'm not called Gilet! My name's Hubert. Then who the bloody hell is James? - Dad! - I told you they were shagging. - Mum! - No, she would've told me. - She tells me everything! - Or maybe she doesn't. Maybe she's not your little girl anymore. And maybe she has got a tattoo. Well... if you're so bloody in love with her, why did you leave her in London? She's not in London. - She's in Kemble at my house. - What? She chose not to come here. And I thought it was because she wanted to spend Christmas with me, but seeing as she's marrying Private Plonker here, maybe she just wanted to get away from you lot and all this madness. I'm actually a Lance Corporal. I don't care if you're the Grand Old Duke Of York! All I know is I've been made to do an awful lot of lying, and I've been lied to an awful lot and I've had enough, and I'm going home. [outer door closes] I'll put the kettle on. [telephone rings] [tearfully] Steve! And you said you couldn't trust me? James, I need you to listen to me. Do you have any idea how humiliated I feel. Are you not even gonna let me talk? Iris was right. Like father like son, innit? You know what, maybe you were right. Maybe we don't know each other. I'd say we should split up, but it turns out... Hello? James! Hayley? Hello? Can you hear me? Bloody landlines! [Father Christmas] Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas...!

I'm sorry, sir. I'm not used to this room being occupied. I just... No, no, please, come in. She saved them all. The theatre programmes from his school plays. Yes, I... I remember her talking about how good he was. I didn't make one performance with Fiona, and then afterwards... I couldn't face it on my own. There's so much I haven't been able to do without her. All our plans for the estate, for the... She was irrepressible, Iris. So full of life, full of hope. Every Christmas Eve, I go and stand by her grave. She isn't there. She's in here. In this room. Forgotten how beautiful it is. Well... all it needed was for somebody to come along and let a bit of light in. You know, you and Hubert are not that different. You're both drawn towards the same sort of person. I think the least you can do is go upstairs and talk to her, don't you? [soft knocking on door] [panting] [soft wheeze] [doorbell rings] Sorry. I was wondering when you'd notice. Well, I should... You any good at wrapping? I always thought Steve was a bit of a knob, truth be told. But you put a brave face on things when your daughter says she likes someone. Find us the end of that, will you, mate? Ta. After you left, he burst into tears. [chuckles] Said Hayley had split up with him just before she went to London, but was afraid to tell her mum. Unbelievable. I've got to admit, I'm relieved. Kath was upset, mind. Took herself off to bed before the end of Muppets Christmas Carol. Was she fond of Steve? He was stationed away most of the time, so we never saw that much of him. Can you just stick your finger there? I think it's more the fact that she couldn't face losing her little girl. If Hayley's with Steve... [spits] then there's a chance that she might come back here and build a life for herself, you know? Not down there in that hell hole with the likes of you. I guess that's why she didn't say anything. Oh... erm... - Give it here, Geoff. - Yeah, thanks, mate. Pigs ear of that. [heavy sigh] I always used to love doing the wrapping with my mum. When did you lose her? It's four years now. - Four years to the day. - Oh, I'm sorry, fella. We'd just run out of cranberry sauce... and my mum insisted on doing a last-minute drive to the shops. She hit some black ice at a junction, and that was that. I can still see her heading out the door saying, 'I'll be right back.' And she never was. Oh, mate. Well, it's been 15 years now for me with my dad. I wish I could say it goes away, but... never really does. Especially at Christmas. After it happened, I wanted to stick around, but... my dad sent me straight back to boarding school, and the whole house sort of shut down. By the time I left, he... he wouldn't even look me in the eye. I started to feel like I'd lost both my parents. The truth is, as much as I wanted to be here with Hayley... an even bigger part of me just wanted a proper family Christmas again. If only it were that simple, eh? I'd be straight round the Dillons' up the road. They have a 'tur-duck-en'. A duck in a turkey in a goose! But that's the ball ache, isn't it, eh? You don't get to choose your family. But for my money, those Christmases when there's only a chicken for dinner... they're normally the most important Christmases of all. Oh, bugger! I forgot to drop off the Dillons' tur-duck-en! [laughter] Cheers! Cheers. [Peanut barks] Find her, boy! Find her! [panting] [Peanut barking] Good boy! Peanut! Good boy! Good boy! Here! It's a good job that dog can't get enough of you, eh? - [puffs inhaler] - Now, come on. Let's get you back in the warm. Right. Come on, Peanut. Home, boy! [electronic 'Jingle Bells' plays] Morning, dear. [whispering] Meet me outside in five. There's something I want to show you. Oh... and Merry Christmas! [soft chuckle] [music ends, James grunts] [brakes screech] [horn honks] As Santa said to Rudolph, 'Let's ride!' - Amazing. - I can't see a bloody thing in these. Right in you hop, Gilet. Your chariot awaits. Thank you! Where do you think you're going? Eh? Oh, I'll be back in time for turkey, love. Geoff, it's Christmas morning! We've spent enough time apart as a family. Now, Kath, listen... You go, we all go! [musical intro plays] Boys, come on! [Geoff] Now, don't worry about the snow. I've modified the van. Oh, shit!

And where's Hayley? Erm... how can I put this? Bloody Macclesfield! Bloody Christmas Day! Bloody ten-hour round trip in the bloody snow! [Hayley] Still can't believe you persuaded him to do this. Well, the upside of someone shooting your dog is that they then owe you a very big favour. Mr Hughes... Please... Humphrey. Humphrey. I'm sorry for overstepping the mark. I just... wasn't thinking. And I'm really sorry Peanut got injured. Well, I'm sorry if I overreacted. Peanut was my wife's dog and... well, I lost her, and... Since then, he's become the biggest part of her I have left. James didn't really tell me that much about his mum but... sounds like she was a really special person. And he didn't tell me much about you either, to be fair. I think what we had helped him escape a lot of things. What you had? Looks that way, yeah. And I know it's not my place to say, but surely the biggest part of her that you've got left isn't Peanut. It's James. Hubert. Hubert. [engine sputters and dies] What? What is wrong? Whoa, whoa! Steady girl on, old girl! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! [loud complaint] [resounding scream] Good night, my beautiful girl. You were the only one I had left to talk to. Well, you could always come up to the house and talk to me. No, thank you. I know where I'm not welcome. It's not my house anymore. Oh, here we go again. What kind of a son throws his own father out on the streets to avoid a little inheritance tax? I didn't throw you out. You chose to leave. And as far as being 'out on the street' is concerned... Hang on a minute! You're father and son? Only when His Grace isn't playing at being Worzel Gummidge. And only when His Lordship's not being a selfish arsehole. Ah. Yeah, yeah. I guess I can see the similarities. I don't think that was called for, do you? Well, no... And I thought my family were weird, Peanut. Looks like I'm not going home for Christmas after all. [distant calliope music plays] Is that... [horn honks] Oh, my God, no way. No way, no way! - [Geoff laughs] - Dad! Well, what the bloody hell are you lot doing out here? [joyous shouting] - I can't believe it! - Iris? Mum! I'm so sorry about Steve. You seemed so happy. I just didn't want to let you down. No. Never mind me. We've got plenty of time for that later. I don't think I'm the one that you need to be saying sorry to. So... So. - Shall we just, erm... - Yeah. Hi. Hi. Shall we... Shall we just start again? I'm Hubert James Manningham-Hughes. 307th in line to the throne. I'm Haylo the Street Witch. First in line for this Mr Whippy van. Look, about Steve... - You don't have to apologise. - No, but I do want you to understand. I understand. I live with lots of family expectations too. And I'm sorry... that I lied. I was... just having so much fun with you, I didn't want to scare you off. Well, I don't scare that easily. I nearly got shot by your granddad! [soft chuckle] Well, I was mugged by your brothers, groped by your aunt, and choked by your nan. So... let's just say it's been a real pleasure getting to know you since the last time we were together. You too. And I would love to get to know you even more. Well... you... will. [romantic music rises] [knocking on window] Here they come, eh? The love birds. Right. The troops need to be fed. Oh, yes, there's plenty of food in the larder back at the house. And I don't know about anyone else, but I could certainly do with some mulled wine. Well, I'm more of a spiced rum man myself. [laughter] Oh, God, wait a minute! What? Nan!
