WHO KNOWS? Stop. French spoken here. I'm home, my tongue, I'm fine. No, it's not that fine. I'm fine, not fine, not fine, I'm fine. I'd just like to have stage fright, that's all, not that much to ask, instead of fear, ridiculous, ridiculous, and foul. And why, why, why? I looked for your blue kimono everywhere. It's not in the basket or in the trunk. I think you left it in Torino. You were supposed to mend it. There on the shoulder, I'm sure. I cherish that kimono. - Where's the bathroom? - At the end of the hall. You didn't give it to me. Find it. Please. Well, right or left? Is Ugo done? I need to speak to him. I don't know. I heard advance sales are low. Did you see? Fosco is being coy! You know where his office is? A bit soon chasing him, no? How do you like the theater? Nice, isn't it? Like it? I keep getting lost as if I were in a foreign land. A good setup. Traditional. I like it very much. A bit red for me. Not for me! What's wrong, Camille? Why do you ask? These past two days, you seem tense. Is it Paris? Maybe... Coming back for the first time after all this time... How long has it been? Two years? No. Three years. Three years, yes... To top it off, playing in Paris in Italian, an Italian author, an Italian company... You won't answer? You answer... She wants to have a drink with you. - So? - Fine. I'm fine... No, don't speak to me. I don't want to talk. And this? That, yes... Pierre? Who's there? Is that you, Ugo? Pierre... what a joke. I really should calm down. I knew it would happen, it was coming. Should have said no, not a chance, not Paris. Even three years later, I can't . I cannot. That's that. Breathe, breathe... My chest is blocked, my temples are pounding. It's horrible. If you hadn't loved me so, I wouldn't feel so bad. If only I had explained, but I couldn't explain. One cannot love so much, it's inhuman. He's a monster. I don't want to see him. Ready? We're on! Paris, here we come! End it? Are you mad? I won't even appear. Go to the door, listen if she's coming up alone. Wait! I hear her shouting! - Maybe she's sending them off. - They're all drunk. Someone was following them. Give me that gun! No, I don't plan to use it. I'll keep it, in my pocket. - Give it to me! - Leave me alone! Do you hear? It's up to you, Signora, to get a hold on your life again! My life? What life? Of Signora Lucia, with your husband. - Have you forgotten? - No, I haven't forgotten! This man is still looking for his wife after ten years? His Cia. Yes, Signora. His Cia! Does he really think she can be the same? If you want to, Signora. After ten years, the same? After all that has passed, the same? He's mad! The proof: She's never returned. If you want to now, Signora... If I want to? Yes, to flee from myself. Remember nothing. Empty my whole being. Yes, mind you: A body... to be just a body. You say it's hers, in her likeness? I no longer feel myself, I no longer care. I no longer know how to live. A body, a body without a name, waiting for someone to take it. Yes, indeed, if he must recreate me, give a new soul... to this body... His Cia? His Cia. Let him take it, and put his memories in it, his own. A beautiful life, a new life. I am but despair! Signora, I rush to call him. No one calls from my house! - I shall call! - No, wait. I'll go. I'll call. And we shall see. Let's be serious! A body without a name. I knew it, I knew it. I don't need you, I don't want to see anyone. Is something wrong? - Thanks. - What for? The blank. Without you, I'd still be there. I thought it was ironic. What? The thanks. I'll be fine. I'm sure of it, Camille. Come, Salter! Boffi, remember to send all my things. Is the car outside? I'll go out like this! Like this. Let's go. No wait. It's more whim than drama. - Ugo, I must speak to you... - I have to hurry. We just got the fax from the bank. The first deposit didn't arrive. I'm out of cash for the per diems. They're ready to explode. Advance sales are disastrous. Only a third of the house. - What do we do? - Pray to the Madonna. Have you seen Miss Renard? She came in ten minutes ago. What happened, Camille, what's wrong? Forgive me. That's all you can say? I've never seen this. Leaving before the bow, opening night... Even if you didn't like it, it's... insulting! - To whom? - The public, me, the company, everyone. I didn't want to insult anyone. I felt bad, it happens. That's not enough. I need an explanation. I can't explain. You can't, or don't want to? Can't I help you? All I can say is I will try... I promise, it won't happen again. You won't tell me more? No, I can't . I'm tired, that's all. Just tired, or... tired...? I'm not very proud of myself. I'm ashamed. So, what are you going to do? Sleep. Then, good night. If you need me, I'm here. Sorry. Out already? Charming. Better and better. Where could he have gone, that bum? It mustn't, I can't, it must not, I must not, it can't go on like this. I must see him. I'll call. No, I'll go. I'd rather see him before talking. See him. To see him? I'll see... Shall I go? Excuse me, I'd like... - May I help you? - Do you work here? No, you look a bit lost. What are you looking for? It's... about Goldoni. An 18th century Italian author. I know Goldoni, even if the 18th and theater aren't my thing. - Nor Italy? - On the contrary, but ancient. - Are you Italian? - How did you guess? Want me to help you? Come. Here you have the stacks: The Rondel deposit, the Douay deposit. Careful not to drop them. Write the references on your card, and wait in the reading room. Thanks for helping me. It's nothing. Good luck. It's dangerous. Hello. Yes... hello. May I help you? Excuse me. Am I at Pierre Mauduit's? He's out. Oh, he's out. Thank you. Goodbye. Would you like to leave word? No... Thank you. Goodbye. Find what you were looking for? I don't think it can be found. And you? A cinch for me. I'm not in foreign territory, I'm polishing up. What is it? - What is what? - Your Goldoni. It's a play, never published, which he wrote in Paris and gave to a friend. I'm keeping you from your work... No, I'm fine. Go on. That's it, the play is called "Il Destino Veneziano". This is why I'm skeptical, not very Goldonian for a title... It is rather... how do you say "apocrifo"? Apocryphal. Well, it might be a hoax but... if it does exist, if it's real, I would go crazy. Now you know everything. So, it's a manuscript? It might still be with the descendants of Goldoni's friend. If they're alive. There are autograph merchants. They might know. Well, that's in case... It's kind of you to tell me. I will see you, you won't be there... No. I won't see you, you will be there. I won't see you, you won't be there... No. You will be there, I shall... Yes... I see him, he's there... Hello, Pierre. Hello, Camille. In three years, I thought you'd have changed your habits. No, no, same morning prayer on the same bench. - What's wrong? - Nothing. As you can see, I'm in Paris. I see. I'm not staying, we leave for Vienna next week. You like that life, I guess. I like that life, absolutely. And you came to tell me. I went by your home. To say hello. Won't you sit? Sonia told you I was here? Her name is Sonia. I love her very much. Been together for two years. I'm happy to see you. Won't you sit? Did you publish your thesis? No, it's really a state thesis. It goes on for years. I'm not done with the old bugger. Heidegger. You remember? I think I even remember the title. A bit complicated... "Heidegger: "The pre-Socratic to the new German thought". More or less. The title has changed. It's shorter. "Heidegger, the jealous one". Hell! Isn't it? Sit down. No, I can't . I'm glad I saw you. I was pleased. Shall we kiss? We kiss. Your wife is pretty. A good person. I printed the last modifications. I was about to re-read it, before dumping it. Very funny. I read it. And? And... first a kiss. It's good. You think so or is it to encourage me? To encourage you to sort it out. How do you find yourself in this mess? And what does it mean, "Gelassenheit"? Impassivity. So, why don't you put "impassivity"? "There is a history of impassivity, "by which man became an animal open to the world, etc..." It's still incomprehensible, but less... Less pretentious, you're right. I'll fix and reprint it? With the German word in parentheses. I love you. Someone came to see you. A woman. What did she want? She didn't say. To see you. I think she was... your ex. Yes, Camille. In fact, I'm sure of it. Did she say anything? Didn't have a chance to talk. You don't look surprised. You have always seen these eyes of Cia? Yes, these eyes! - They are not the same? - Yes, the same! These are the same, not those! A bit green... What green, they're blue! For you, green. For you, blue. And for Bruno, look: Grey with black lashes. Even the painter had his word... "The real eyes of Cia". Try to define them, even using a portrait! Dear Pierre. My dear Pierre. Pierre, I forgot... stupidly, no, today I forgot... to tell you that if you want to see the show, I'll leave two tickets at the counter, for tomorrow night, and the other nights. If you want to come, come, but don't come if you don't want to. Come in, it's here. Sorry. Excuse me. I prepared an isograph of your author... An isograph? What is it? A sample of the writing which allows experts to discern real from fake. People come from around the world. For the letter G: Gobineau, Goethe... This is a photocopy. Keep it. I made it for you. A letter he might have written to Mr. Vernet. Yes, Nicolas Vernet. He helped Goldoni when he was in Paris... Look at your... isograph. It is dated December 9th 1771. It could be to him. And the trifle he speaks of, it could be the play... What play? A ghost play, unpublished, which Goldoni might have given to Mr. Vernet, to thank his generosity. I'm set on finding it, and be the first to direct it. One can dream... Indeed. Mr. Bassani... I shouldn't advise you, but if I were in your shoes, and I had an unpublished play... What would you do? I know someone who has a manuscript poem of Rimbaud. Only the last two stanzas were published. I guarantee the public won't discover the beginning. I understand. You think so? You're telling me: "My best wishes to you. "Find the work." You know people who would pay a fortune... if the work remains unpublished. But if I put on a show... Hello, is this the ticket counter? Good evening, this is Camille Renard. I just wanted to know, I left two seats in care of Mauduit. Only one person? Man or woman? Man, of course. Why, of course? No reason. So, if they arrive, I bring them in? Yes, yes, bring them in! It's useless. Go! Useless, useless but not important. I just want to tell you... I was with you for four months. Look at me! In the eyes, deep inside my eyes! They've stopped looking for me. They are no longer mine, not even to look at myself. They've been like this, like this, in your eyes forever that they may see, through yours, an image of me as you saw me. I came here, gave myself to you totally, I told you: I'm here, I'm yours. Make me, make me... ...as you desire me. You waited for me for ten years? Do as if nothing happened! I am yours again and no longer mine, nor to the life I lived. No, I have no memories, nothing. Give me yours! All those you kept of her before! I, Cia! I am Cia! I alone! I! Not the one who was, and... What was it? To be? To be is nothing! To be is to make oneself! And I became her! You have understood nothing! There's no one left. You plan to spend the night here? Is something wrong? No, nothing. You look your usual... a bit haggard. No, it's nothing, I'm just a bit... I invited someone, I'm surprised he didn't come up. He must have hated it. Who was it? You don't know him. Him. Are you sure he came? No matter. Shall we go? Go on, I'll join you. - It's him? - Yes. I'll meet you at the bistro. No, at the hotel. I can wait. Go ahead, I'll meet you at the hotel. I must say I found you magnificent. Thanks. Sonia couldn't come? Will you have a drink? I have to meet Ugo. His name is Ugo. Walk with me a bit. You said magnificent to be polite... I'm short on superlatives. And I was seated a bit far, you were in a kind of light... you radiated, yes, the word I was looking for: Radiated. It was strange, for me at least. That aside, did you understand, more or less? Yes, everything. Well, almost... It's about rekindling a love. No matter who does the work. Or... Or what? Nothing. Whatever... you were magnificent. What was her name again? She has no name. In the text, she's the Ignota, the Unknown. You're a magnificent unknown. You know, I never forgot you. Three years, and not a day without thinking of you. I don't want to know. We'd like to have you for dinner. It's Sonia's idea. Is it possible? Maybe Monday, our night off. I'll have to talk to Ugo. After tomorrow, perfect. Ugo... He's the director? Yes, he directs the company. And you live with him? Monday at what time? Normal time, eight-nine. Come the two of you. - Everything's normal then? - Everything's normal. See you on Monday. Come in... I'm not sleeping. You didn't go with the others? I was waiting for you. To tell me what? You have something to tell me, no? So, it's him? Yes. Him who? Him, Pierre... Pierre Mauduit. French, Parisian, professor of philosophy, married, maybe... or living with a certain Sonia. That's all for the personal details. He's a good person. By the way, Pierre and Sonia invited us to dinner on Monday. - After tomorrow? - Yes. I accepted. Without asking me? I said I'd talk to you. It's what I'm doing. What is he to you, that... Pierre? I lived with him before, before I... I lived with him when I was in Paris. He liked the play very much... As if he understood everything. He's not a bore, you know... He's a good man. And he liked the play... You lived with him how long? Two years... Almost two years. But not quite. No, not quite. Fine. Where are you sleeping? Next door. I want to sleep. Me too. I'll sleep. What did it do to you to see him? You still love him? No... I'm sure of it. Am I at Madame Desprez's? Mother! Hello Madame. Ugo Bassani. I called... Yes, yes. I know. - Marie-Pierre Desprez. - Delighted. Come in, come in, please. You didn't get lost? Great! I just put a cake in the oven. I'm experimenting in pastry. It's not very cultural. It is cultural... it smells very good. Thank you. - What can I give you? - Nothing. - A bit of port? - No, thank you. The Nicolas Vernet library has become a legend for me. The thought of entering it... my heart races. Few people know it's here. How did you find us? I met the right people. Here you are! To me, it's a pile of dust. Sorry, it always happens, I suffocate. These papers are bugs' nests! Come back as often as you want, but without me... My first husband would turn in his grave. He was a Delamarche, his grandmother was a Vernet. This library... he spent his life in it, more time than with me, but I swore I wouldn't touch it. It's from his great-grandparents, and all that is Vernet... Your first husband's ancestor, he was... a magnificent man... a great... how do you say? Bibliophile! Yes, I know. He amassed treasures. If it were up to Georges... my second husband, everything would be sold and I'd be rich! But I am absurdly and revoltingly loyal. The manuscripts are classified... My daughter knows better, she sniffs around at times. She's a real literary person. Not like my son, Arthur, from my first marriage. My daughter is from the second marriage. She's a Desprez! Do you have any children? I must check my cake. Go ahead, don't be shy, go and rummage... Excuse me. What for? I don't know, I... These old books are fascinating but once they're opened, it's a dismay. I didn't say hello before. Arthur Delamarche. - Ugo Bassani, I am... - Yes, I heard. - So, did you find it? - Not yet, but... - You're hopeful? - Always. My eldest son, Arthur. You never hear him come in or leave... A real cat. I'll never get used to it. - Staying for dinner? - I don't know. You need money. I always need money, mother. But first I'll have a drink. Ugo? Why not. See you soon. Excuse me. My mother said... this... belongs to you. Thank you. So you are the daughter... Dominique, they call me Do. How funny. Will you walk with me? No, I can't, I have to work. - On ancient Rome? - Yes, ancient and modern. Will you help me? How? Sniffing out the secrets of the library. I'll try. Thanks. See you tomorrow. In position. Look at your hand. Away from the bar. Back straight. Very good El?onor and Agathe. Second position. Arched back. Heels back. Third position... El?onor, no yawning, class is almost over. No one enters before the end of class. I love you too much, I need to be close to you. Stop joking. Arms in a crown. Class is finished. In position for the bow. I wasn't joking. I don't believe a word you say. - You don't respect anything. - Nothing. But you, I respect. Me? You accosted me in that bookstore, you haven't ceased to shock me. You outrageously tried to pick me up, openly disregarding the man I love. You call that respect? You remind me of someone I knew before. Really... Who? Someone who is dangerous. Very well girls. There must be some kind of order. Must have been. But when? Who knows? No, that's not it. I can't find it. "Il Destino Veneziano"... "Il Destino Veneziano"... Is it really the title, are you sure? According to my sources. If only it were in alphabetical order, and at the letter D... A treasure, it has to be hidden. What's wrong? Why are you staring at me? I think you're handsome. No, I'm joking... Well, no. You have shadows under the eyes. Tired? This tour is harder and harder. Mother and I plan to go tomorrow, it's not full? Far from it, unfortunately. I'm delighted you are coming. She'll ask me to translate, explain everything. There will be "shhs" all around us. I baked cookies... Care for some? Bless you, mother. No thanks, we're working. I hope she didn't hear me. Luckily she hears nothing, sees nothing. She's right, it protects her. - Protects her from what? - Everything... Weird things happen here. In this room. Things come and go. Things? May I help? We don't need you. Let us work. I'm watching over you. I had a sleepless night, I was cleaned out, I'm dead. I need consolation. - You know each other? - Yes, we met yesterday. And you? You know each other? What's it to you? I'll have coffee in the kitchen. I need to talk to you. He bugs me. I think I bug him too. It's not you. It's you being with me. Really? He's not my brother, he's my half-brother. He has no rights over me. When I was little, we were very close. What? Flowers? I shouldn't have? It's not the first time you've come. Coming here? Yes, it's the first time. Good evening. Excuse me, wet hands, from cooking. Astromerias, how lovely. You switched the living room and dining room. Not me, Sonia. Sit down. Are you alone? Ugo is coming on his own, I was hoping... I thought he'd be here... I hope he won't be long. You hope? I mean, I think. I'll get the wine. How is the play going? Alright. It's been a while since you've been in Paris... Three years. It must seem odd. A bit. Your ring is beautiful. It's my engagement ring. With Pierre? My previous life. Another life. Very different. - Is this your thesis? - No, my nightmare. I mean, my class. Still at Poitiers? Transferred to Rennes... That's not the worst part. Two days a week, it shouldn't be hard but you know how I am... If you haven't forgotten. Finicky. Conscientious. I can't rush, I'd feel dishonest. I waste a lot of time and the backlog increases, I curse the CNRS, the ministry, and that sense of duty which enslaves me to the school system. A corpse in the State's service while the world waits to be freed by me... I'm boring you. Not at all. You aren't listening. I'm just wondering about Ugo. He should be here, I hope he's not lost. Can't you forget your Ugo for five minutes? It's not that late. Your glass is empty. It's the third, it's delicious, I must stop. I'll go. I just wanted to say. I am so... happy - you're here. - I believe you. - Hurt yourself? - You're not happy? - Yes I am. - Not really. Pierre, I'd just like... - Say you're happy. - May I? I am happy. May I go? Excuse me. Hasn't changed much after all. I almost moved all the furniture and even changed the rooms. - I'm a bit feng-shui. - A bit much. I felt it would be cruel for you. So I gave up. You are what? Feng-shui, Chinese geomancy. The art of organizing the environment... I can't stand that stuff. The older I get, the more Western I get. More European, Latin. Further and further West. I had bad times before I met Pierre. I got over it through yoga, feng-shui, and dance. I did a bit of dance, I kept it up, the rest I quit. Why do you say "a bit"? - You still do. - A bit. I have a group of students. Very talented little girls, they give me a lot and I hope I give them back a bit. I, too, went through a difficult period. I didn't need yoga, qingong, what not... - I met you, that's all. - Yes, yes. I can say it three times... What I say three times is true. In my experience, everyone goes through hard times. When I speak of hard times, I mean hell. I wallowed in a pond of sulfur, and I thought if I saw the one who dunked me, my very gaze would turn her into ashes. You dream up things, when you are in hell. It's dumb huh? But after so much suffering... I began to understand, I thought it out, everything. But... hell... the real one, does one ever leave it? I'm the living proof. Ugo is asking you if you really left it. I had locked myself into a position where I was the oppressor and the oppressed. I understood that jealousy is a dictatorship, or as Malaparte says: "Dictatorship is the supreme form "of jealousy". Yes, your compatriot. It's the epigraph to my thesis. It sums up the incantations of the old man of the Black Forest, even if he seems to say the opposite, an opening to the soul, truth as unveiling... Sonia, tell me to stop. I could go on till dawn. Then again, Heidegger... Why did I get on to him...? You were speaking of hell. What did you want to say before? When, before? In the cab, just before we arrived. Sorry, I don't remember. I'm sure you remember very well. Really... how come? Because. For three hours you did your usual act, judging with that superior air, - setting up your blow. - What blow? What blow? Mama yourself! First, you arrive late. Very late. As if it were on purpose. Second, as soon as you get there, you become the emcee, in an exasperating way. And third... I find Sonia most appealing. I don't doubt it. Thanks to you, the dinner was a catastrophe. I don't agree. I had a good time. - Not me. - No, why not? I was ashamed of you. I was ashamed all evening. I'm sorry. I'm an actor. Not a university professor. Don't be a hypocrite. Taking that superior air. Unbearable! Really... Perfectly! As in: "This guy is weird". He is not weird, he was ill at ease, it's normal. You're not normal! You don't say anything? Not when you're in that state. I'm waiting for you to calm down. You can wait! Paris is getting to you. You are getting to me! Let me go! Forgive me... It's all my fault. I never should have... It's not a tragedy, you know. I assure you... Maybe you had too much to drink... Don't you think? Is it Hebrew or Phoenician? More like "Fibulian". And what is "Fibulian"? The language of safety pins. For my thesis, want to know the title? "History of the fibula in the Orient, Greece, and Rome in Antiquity "and its 20th century reproductions in Italian and American film." The fibula is the brooch which holds the two sides of the peplos, there, on the shoulder. You're smart! I'm Roman. I like togas, pleats, drapes. I wore quite a few as Titus, Corialanus. Do you want to move on? Let's go. Careful, it's fragile... The irillia, the scorpion, one with wings, the cone-shaped, the Jezerine, with hidden springs, the peacock tail with bows... with a lock between two plates... zoomorphic brooches for the British, and so forth up to the Merovingians. Unfortunately the gods are furious and lash out at this new love. Andromeda flees. Philip looks for her everywhere, in hell, in the cities in ruin, in the desert, everywhere! He becomes the hero at Marathon. Theocritus tries to stop him but he manages to organize a resistance against Darius... Theocritus dies in battle, really! Philip finds Andromeda and Athens finds real peace. Really, you have never seen it? I didn't find the cassette, Arthur saw it. Arthur is really your brother? Half... As long as he's not your husband. - You have a girl in this class? - Excuse me? No. Too young for that... You must be an older sister. No daughter, no sister. So you're a dancer? Neither. You could be. There... Close in front. And a small bow... to finish. But little by little she discovers what she thought was a marriage of love was of convenience... with tangled family ties. So loathing arises... You don't speak. Am I boring you? No. I'm fine. I'm sad. You can't be sad, I'm here with you. You are lucky... To have met you, indeed. To be someone else every night. And never really serious. I wanted to tell you... I'm a bit embarrassed about last night. Why? You had nothing to do with it. It was rather funny. You really think so? When Pierre gets started, it's hard to stop him... He's mad. Precisely... I know what you were to him. Pierre hides nothing from me. I wasn't surprised. I am surprised... Surprised by you. By me? Yes, I don't know... Your calm, if you will. - Am I being too frank? - No. Still, I feel I have, without wanting, disturbed... your tranquility. It's not to find my own that I wanted to see you... Maybe if... Don't worry. I wasn't disturbed. I am very happy to have met you. I don't know what else to say. Excuse me, I must give up the room. Excuse me. Goodbye. Another time, perhaps... Call me before. I'll go! Will you kindly understand you are mistaken and leave? The Signora knows I am not mistaken. As long as you do not call my husband. Signora, your husband... Be done with this husband! You told me he was dead. The Signora lied. Thank you, Sir, for this affirmation. Thank God! You lied? Wait before thanking God. I thank you for the satisfaction you give me by affirming so strongly the right I have to lie despite the life I've led. You want me to account for my lies? Account for your own! - I never lied! - You? We do just that, all of us! Four years ago, I could have lost someone who wasn't my husband. If it's him, he's changed his voice. He's playing a part, mother. Tell us a bit of the story, it would be interesting to know. And hence learn some truth on this Signora Lucia I am to be. Listen, listen... Allow me to speak to you face to face! Not face to face... ...in front of him. I'd like him to know. Excuse me. I'll wait. I'm coming. She's the actress? She is very pretty. She speaks French without an accent. Mother, she's French. Camille Renard. So she's bilingual! - I admire that. - I'll tell her. And you, Dominique? It was beautiful. Honestly? I'll tell you tomorrow. Pierre? Is that you, Camille? We have to see each other. I want to talk to you. I want to see you too. What is wrong? Is it urgent, urgent? We have to talk it over, I need to, I can't go on like this. Talk about what? You know very well. May I see you? Right now, I have a lot of work... I'm off to Rennes tomorrow. I have to prepare. Are you alone? Yes. Sonia is at her lesson. I'm coming. - Now, right away? - Yes. Yes, come. What is it? It looks like another register. There are numbers, names. I don't understand... I think I understand the classification. It's half alphabetical, half thematic. But, in fact, there were several... conflicting. You scared me. What's wrong today? Nothing, I'm fine. Yesterday you were happier. That's not true. Happy, sad... Today you're cold. Not at all, I'm not cold. I am pensive. Better look for what you're looking for than worry about me. What did I do? What did I say? Nothing, you are... as you are. What? I found it. I have it, I'm holding it! "Il Destino Veneziano"? Are you sure? Where is the title? There is no title. That's it? It's him? "Bernardino Perfetti... Sienna. "1742." It's not him. You looked so happy... The writing, it looked so much like... We haven't checked everything. Of course, it must be here. It should be here... It was here. Didn't you say things come and go? Clearly, things "go", disappear. No? Not many. "Things come and go. He's a gambler." You said it! Talking about your brother. Maybe, so what? Maybe he likes burning books. He loves beautiful bindings. And money. What are you trying to do? Trying to lead me against him? You'll never succeed. No one, do you understand? No one. It took you a while. I came right away... Pierre, we must be frank, both of us. You could say hello. I'm gathering my notes for my class. I told you the other day, the other night... - Are you listening? - I'm listening. I thought I clearly told you, I'm not the one you knew before. There's no going back. I've got a new life too. I love Ugo. I love what I do with him. I love working under his gaze. You came to talk about your job? To tell you I've grown up. I heard you clearly, I understand perfectly. You say there's no going back. But neither is there change. We are the same, you and I, as before. You're scared. I understand. It's terrible... and marvelous. What are you talking about? It's not what I'm trying to say. I don't care what you're trying to say. You're here, that's what counts. You're at home and you know it. Not at all, it's the opposite. I'm elsewhere, definitely elsewhere. You have to understand. There is no elsewhere, only here. I didn't come and get you. You came. You're here and you're staying. What are you talking about? You have to be in Rennes tonight. Don't look at me that way. You're right, forgive me. I'll accompany you. This way... What are you doing, kicking me out? We didn't talk. We'll have all the time! What are you doing? Open up! I'm keeping you, I am not letting you leave again. I'm not strong enough. You stay. Stop, you idiot... You're mad! Open up! Yes, I'm mad... about you. I never stopped, never will. It's crazy, Sonia will arrive... She may or may not understand. I don't care. I have the theater, I can't, they're waiting for me... I've been waiting three years. Think about it. Think. No one in sight. I always worried about her. Yes, I know... not professional. Enough. She's here now. Let her get dressed. It's not a tragedy, I'm not dead. All is well. Fifteen minutes before the curtain. Ten minutes late! What truth? - Can you believe her? - They believe her! They believe. Because it's the truth. The facts. The very "deceit" he believes in. What are you saying, Signora? How is it possible? It's a vendetta against me, fiercer than his! It's not mine. The facts avenge you. What did you want by calling them forth? I can't accept to be recognized by them. You were to recognize me, only you, unselfishly. It went well tonight, no? We had the right pace. - What we don't have is the public. - We had some. Not enough. It's madness, this tour. An abyss. You're worried? More than that, I'm scared. Scared of losing the company. It's not like you. That's what scares me. Excuse me. No, Dominique. Come in. - Didn't we meet before? - Yesterday. Ah yes, yesterday. I had to see it without my mother. I was so uncomfortable. Does it stand a second viewing? Yes... Totally. Dominique is writing a thesis. Just a paper, but I don't like talking about it. Excuse me. We meet tomorrow? Probably. See you tomorrow then. Goodbye. You're seeing her tomorrow? My old Goldoni quirk, she's helping. I'm not questioning you. Shall we have dinner? I'm not very hungry. I can't find the big register. It's disappeared. Really... you're blind. There, in front of you. I meant the other one, the one you found yesterday. Arthur might have taken it. I don't see why... it's definitely not sellable. Maybe it's in my room. Why? What if I took it last night - because I couldn't fall asleep... - As soporific? Drastic. And then I had strange dreams with Arthur, mother... and you. What are you looking for? The register. It's under my bed. - Which side? - Guess. North, south, hot, cold. I'm not in the mood for guessing. Why? Maybe because I'm a bit too old. You don't believe it. Or not old enough... If you had to choose? Between what and what? The Venetian destiny or... a Parisian chance. You're the Parisian chance? Look at me. Look at me in the eyes and I'll tell you. I love you, Ugo. I think I love you... Don't say you had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to say... I can't tell you anything. Nothing? Let me go, leave me alone. Let me go! Let her go. - She said to let her go. - You too. Get out, both of you. I'd like a seat in the orchestra. Hurry, it's about to start. She's downstairs with the same crowd. I saw her through the window. - What do you have there? - Nothing. If she brings them up, I forbid you to stay with them! What do you want to do? I don't know, it must end. - End? Are you mad? - Wait! - I hear her shouting. - Maybe she's sending them off. They're all drunk. Someone was following them. Give me that gun. No, I don't plan to use it. - I'll keep it here, in my pocket. - Give it to me! Leave me alone! Do you hear? Sounds like they're fighting. What a shame! An aggression! No, please, don't try to hug me now. Get out or I'll shoot! They make me sick! - What did they want? - The same thing, the pigs. They made me drink so much... It's scandalous! The neighbors will complain again. I told you to kick me out! No, Elma! He says it's a scandal. Shouldn't go out with them again. No, I will go out with them, look. I prefer it. I will join them. Who are you, may I ask? You should have told me, I'd have left a ticket... I... prefer paying to watch. I don't know what to say, except that I liked it, I think. You are very good. The part is... dangerous. Beautiful but dangerous. No difficulties with the Italian? I resorted to my past. You were in Italy? I moved around. Even went to jail. Well... I'm off before I tell my life story. Don't have time for a drink? No, I have a date, I'm already late. I'm touched you came. I am touched. I assure you. Good night. A shot of whiskey, please. We are being watched. No one cares. Don't resist... don't hold back, you are mine. I'm not yours. Let yourself go. Close your eyes. Sleep, Sonia, I want it. Excuse me. Ready? And you? Can we walk together? Want to be my guide? Something to apologize for? Always the same with you. Always the same, always another. Not in love anymore? I didn't say that... Who's there? It's me, Do. Am I disturbing? What is it, Do? Nothing... You didn't answer. Am I disturbing? May I come in? You're not alone? Yes, in fact. That's why you can't come in. I frighten you? I just want to talk. I don't want to. What did I do? Nothing. I don't deserve this... I want an explanation. If you come in, I can't promise anything. Either I jump on you and devour you, or I give you a spanking of a lifetime. I'll take a chance. Not me... I beg of you. Leave. Or I'll never see you again. And our Goldoni? I don't care about Goldoni. I give up. No, I do care but... I can't succumb to you now. You make me very sad, Ugo. I'm not used to this, it's too hard... Stop acting spoiled. Don't wreck everything! Do? I didn't mean it... Not the eyes, not the eyes! Sonia, it's me, Camille. I thought... How horrible. I thought I was in a cell with the fat one... In a cell with the fat one? With her greasy hair and big cigars. She bribed the guards, couldn't help herself. She really hit me hard. My head really hurts. It's horrible. Do I have any marks? No. I don't see anything. I'm thirsty. This prison thing... I thought it was a joke. I wish it were. Ten months. Makes you think twice. I'm still thirsty. - What did he give me to drink? - Who? Him, Arthur. You never did anything wrong? Yes... I did. Living with Pierre, and leaving him. Maybe. You agree, he's mad? One could say that. Totally. He's like the other one. What other one? Eight, ten years ago. I only thought of dance, I was... He taught me... everything. He lived at night, slept in daytime. I'd wait for him at the corner, to help him, hide him. Then I wanted to participate. I was like a kid, I thought it was fun, exciting... Fun! Climbing fences, breaking windows, scaring people, neutralizing them, taking their valuables, their jewels... Living it up, grand hotels, that kind of... It's funny, my finger shrank. What is it? It's not my ring. It's a fake. He robbed me. I knew it. I was sure of it. This studio is badly oriented... May I see it? It's from the Second Empire with two very pure diamonds. Signed Mellerio di Meller. He knew... the bastard. Is it worth a lot? If he knocks on the right door, I dare not say... How can you tell it's a fake? The real one has an inscription. "Tempus fugit, manet amor." I kept it as a... lucky charm. Without it, I feel naked. I'll make him regret it. Think it's funny? No, I'm discovering you. I like you, Sonia. And I hate you. What are you going to do? That's my problem. I'll leave you. I have to think it over. Camille... it's not true. - What? - I like you too. Despite it all. Try to call her, you too. Here you are! Here I am. Wait. Turn on the light. We can barely see. You don't remember... We met two or three days ago. I remember. Very well. I wanted to tell you something... but facing you, I'm paralyzed. Paralyzed? It's like you. You know me that well? Enough. I wanted to say you were fantastic. I see you are stiff, hostile. What did I do? I'm just a bit in a hurry. I'm expected. Meaning: Get out. A pity... I understand your character better than anyone. I am the Unknown, even if you think you know me. We'll see about it another time. I'll take you up on it, when? Listen... I know you won't call me. But I will come and see you. See you soon. Are we having dinner tonight, or do you have something else? No, I have nothing. Why do you ask? I don't know Camille, I have a huge load on my shoulders. Yesterday, we almost had a catastrophe. You've been by my side, but, frankly, now I don't know where you are. I'm here. Don't play with words. You almost missed the curtain call. You call that being here? I didn't miss it. You want me to be more frank? So I ask you, who are you with, who do you spend the day with, who do you hang out with? How dare you speak to me that way? Are you going back to him? Or is it already done? I won't even answer... I have a question for you. Do you think I'm bad? No. Not that. You're anything but bad. You might hate me, but for Vienna, you should think of a replacement. Are you serious or do you just want to hurt me? You should just think about it. No reason to dramatize. No reason to. No, I do have the object. Not virtually, really. The problem... there is no problem. It's a deal, if the money is real, not virtual. Better today than tomorrow. Then better tomorrow than after tomorrow. I'll meet you. Goodbye. - Waiting for someone? - Who knows? But you're here. Come and help me. - You plan to score? - Don't talk that way. Who was it? Who was what? On the phone. I never talk business, Do. I don't like your business. The sad story of my life. Let me finish. You're really hopeless. And you're smart, handsome, gifted, the only one I love. What were you saying? - I only love you. - Liar. You're in love and miserable. I don't know what you see in him. See his nose? It's part of his charm. With you, anything goes. Ever since you left home, every time I fall in love, something is wrong. In the end, you pick up the pieces. Stop. You're perfect. You have everything... At least I have you. I hope. May I sleep here? I slept badly, I'm dead tired. Me too, I didn't sleep well. Why? Did something stupid? One more, one less... You're beautiful, that's all. Beautiful... I feel awful. You're beautiful. I had a strange experience yesterday. For the first time in my life... For the first time in your life? No, nothing. Where are you going? Come in. Am I disturbing you? I brought it for you. It's today's . There's a good review. Also... it's a book I like very much. I'd like to know... Think I'm overdoing it? I think you think too much over what I think. At this time, I think very little. This is a good review? Frankly, I'm not here for that. I wanted to see you because I thought... You thought... It's alright. It's about the ring? You said you did not think... I didn't say "not". I said "very little". Yes, the ring. The only treasure of my old life. My secret trophy. I care about it more than I can say. It's my soul, it's me. Do you understand? Not really. But I believe you. Arthur knows I know, for sure... I can't press charges, and I'm alone. Unless you... Me? What can I do? I don't know, but if we're two... Two accomplices? For instance, one is the look out, or distracts him, while the other... Too complicated. I don't know, I'm thinking... I can't go there when he's there. - But maybe... - I can. How? There, it's our pact. If I succeed, if I retrieve your ring... Don't ask me how. Surprise. Expecting someone else? No, I expect nothing, no one. Are you alone, can we talk? I have work, but come in. Why do you want to talk? You don't have the slightest idea? If it's about Camille, I have nothing to say. When you talk about Camille, it's my wife. You have a tendency to forget. I'm here to remind you. Ram it into your brain. Quite a program. You're funny, you know. Today, I'm funny. But a century ago, for instance in Vienna, we'd settle this on the Prater with pistols. I miss those times. Today, I miss it dearly. A duel to death. Quite an original fantasy. Don't joke, I might take you up on it. - Really? - Yes, really. I might challenge you. I'd love it. But you don't think it feasible. How convenient. With pistols? You've prepared something... Less enthusiastic? On the contrary. You make me laugh. You've laughed once too often. You're the offended? The offended chooses weapons and place. Exactly. Are you seriously serious? Do I look like I'm joking? What do you choose? Come to the theater at four tomorrow, use the actors' entrance. I'll be there. That's the place. And the weapon? You'll see. Till death? Till death. I'll be there. Come, Salter! Remember, Boffi, to send all my things. The car is outside? I'll go like this! Like this! Let's go. - No wait! - And us? How? Like this? Let's be serious. Good evening. You should have told me to chill the champagne. How original. Where do these stairs lead? A terrace where I dry my laundry. It's nice. It's very nice. You're surprised? A bit. I do what I want. - Just like that? - Not quite. But we'll do as if. You sleep here? A bit close to the door, no? On the mezzanine, in the morning, the light is too bright. I changed the sheets. - I don't know why I said that. - A thoughtful touch... Don't say anything. I like you, especially when you don't seem to know everything. I really like you. I came to make you an offer. Mind you, take it or leave it. If you're not interested, I leave right away. Speak your mind... I give you this night. This night only. After... never again. Never is a harsh word. Never. Yes or no? If it's yes I stay. If it's no, I go for the door. Choose. I'll give you three minutes. Where is the bathroom? There, at the end of the hall. It's yes. Sugar. Salt. Flour. Already? I said, "this night only". It's dawn. Get the eggs. In the refrigerator. Mother, is it really necessary? - The eggs? - No. Mr. Bassani was really charming, he loves cakes. They're leaving tomorrow, I want to do something. I said I would, I am doing something. Anything but zuppa inglese, it's awful. Then something else. Give me an idea, stop criticizing. This, done and done again. I don't know this one... Might be something in here. What is this? What? It's not a cookbook. "Il gestino..." - "Testino..." - Let me see. "Il... "... Festino Veneziano." It's great! It was an "F"! What's wrong, are you mad? Yes! Joyously mad, mother! It's great! Make it simple, your Black Forest recipe. It's delicious. Tell me what to do, mother. Fine. Get the eggs. A Russian roulette, is that it? - Are you afraid? - No, curious. Even for a Russian roulette, why go up so high? Do you have vertigo? Not particularly. Can you stand liquor? Won't you explain the principle? We go up to the flies, a kind of gangplank. In the middle, there are two bottles. Vodka. Full bottles. One for each. We stand straight and drink... That's it. The first to fall wins. Loses. That's what I meant. It could be simpler, but it's your choice of weapons. Your choice. I would have done the same. A bit of friendly advice: Never look down. Thanks. Pretty stiff. Pretty. What is that scenery? A spot of Venetia. It's all relative. The only certainty is the law of gravity. I told you. You were warned. It's a game. We can change the rules. If we cheat, yes. But I don't cheat. I don't see you. You don't exist. Not true. If I touch you, you tremble. Don't fight it, Camille, come to me. You're ridiculous. Leave. You despise me. We made a pact, a contract, whatever. Act like a man and respect our agreement. Like a man, all is said. All is said. Leave. I won't tell you a third time. You are destroying me. I'm sorry, Arthur, but you started it. And now it's over. "E finita la commedia," curtains. No appeal? A few unpleasant nights and it will pass. You're wrong. It won't pass. But all is well. You are beautiful. Of character too. You've changed me. Camille, I'm not the same and you can't see it. I'll think of you every time... I will think of you. Goodbye. A clown's joke, your duel. You too, you're a clown. First time I'm called that. A clown... a philosophical one. No, it's not me... Heidegger. With his little hat. He has... a hat? Had. He's dead. And a beret too. And the baffi? Moustaches. Yes, moustaches. Like the... great pre-alpian thinkers. Pre... alpian? All the pre-alpian thinkers have... Baffi, You should have some. I have them, thanks. In a drawer. We don't have any... you get or give. Moustaches? No... You are drunk my friend. I am not drunk, I'm floating, look... I shouldn't say, but it's pitching. A bit of friendly advice: Never... You said it before... friends like you... You know... we could have been. To life or to death. To death... I'll be married within the year. What? "But where there is peril... "there grows what saves!" How do we get out of this? Where's the exit? Where is everyone? Anyone here? Hello, mother. What are you doing here? I never see you. Out for a walk? I'm looking for the exit. I'm lost. Ugo, you will never guess, you will drop dead! It's already done, Madame, or almost... It's nothing, you know. Hello, Arthur. Guess what one finds kneading dough! I don't know, a fibula? This... - Where is he going? - The toilet, I think. I hope. What's wrong, Arthur? Hello, Sonia. I'm looking for Pierre. He left me a message. He's in danger. Seen him? I'm here. What are you doing there? I'm here for no one. It's me, Sonia! Stop clowning around. Come down, I'm scared of heights! No. Don't disturb me, I'm sleeping. If you don't come down right away... - I'll come and get you. - Come. I'm sleeping! - What have you done to him? - Nothing, Sonia. We had to settle it but I didn't want anyone to die. So... Thank you. You're welcome. I had a bit to drink, but what I saw... is what I saw? Yes, what you were looking for. I am overjoyed. But at the same time... It hurts... I'm so sad I could cry. I think I shall... Here, keep it. If I touch it again, I'll take it and leave with it. Make a good photocopy and send it to me. Alright? But... don't forget: If I put on a show... the manuscript will lose its... If you put on the show, I'll see it. That's all. Sorry. I've held back too long. Mission accomplished. "Tempus fugit, manet amor." Congratulations. You won it, keep it. The fruit of your exploits. I feel better without it. A thousand times better. I feel lighter. Pierre! I'm coming up! What did you do to her? Take me in your arms. - Are you coming to Vienna? - To the end of the world. Here, a present. It's a fake? Want to hear a figure? We're saved! The company is saved. The theater is saved. - The world is saved. - We are saved. Stop sulking, you look like a wet dog. All's well, Do, all is very well. Will you dance? Who wants the first slice? No one wants any?
