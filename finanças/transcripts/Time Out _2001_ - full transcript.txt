TIME OUT Hello, Muriel. Did you sleep well? Did Alice have a hard time getting up? I'm OK... I have a meeting on the other side of Marseille. I'm already late. Yeah, it will take all morning. I don't know. I'll call you at 1. Will you be at home? Well, OK... Later... I love you. Muriel, I lost track of time. I was afraid you'd already left for school. Sure, it went well... But impossible deadlines... I had to catch us up. What? Are you joking? Don't make fun of me! Don't expect me to be perfect. I'm losing you... I can't hearyou... That's better... My day isn't over. Still another client to see. This one won't be easy to get rid of. We have a restructuring plan to organise. I hope it won't end too late. Don't count on me for dinner. Of course, I plan to come home. I'll call you around 6. I'll know more then. OK? I love you. And now fortoday's stock exhange movements,,, It didn't go well at all. It took 3 of us... But we didn't convince him. Now we have to have dinner together. Sort of an emergency unit... Sorry. Tonight is off. Tomorrow, I promise. I have to talk to you about Switzerland. There's a big chance... It just may work out. Nothing's certain. We'll talk this weekend. OK? I have to go. I love you. See you tomorrow. Daddy! Daddy! How are my little monsters? Hurry up for my school fair! Mum said you wouldn't arrive on time. Really? You're back so early! I got off early because of yesterday's hell. I left you a note because we're on our way out. We've only got 3 teachers for that fair! I've had it, I swear. Hurry up, Alice, or we'll be late. Your car or mine? I'm dead tired. I'll rest and join you later. Felix is counting on you. Sure. Just a little nap. Hey, Mum! Hi, son. Muriel says you might change jobs. I asked you to keep it to yourself. You had to tell her... Is it true or not? - Nothing's sure yet. Good luck getting information out of him! Grandma! What is with you? Will you ever tell me about this job? I promise I will. See you later. Before I forget... Your colleague... That English guy... Jeffrey? - He called... Just afteryou left. Wednesday, I think... What did he want? Don't know... To speak to you. See you later. Listen, Jeffrey. I told you not to call here. I already told you. Muriel is still too weak. I want to keep her out of all this. I know I'm not easy to reach... But I don't want you calling here, OK? I'm sorry, but I don't have time. I'll call you later. Vincent... Vincent... Wake up. Hi, Dad. I didn't hearyou. What time is it? I hope the school fair isn't over. That's exactlywhy I'm here. - That's good ofyou. You're so pale. You're not going to send me to the doctor, are you? But you look tired. I'm just a little overworked. So it seems you're applying for a new job. News travels fast! Won't you tell us more? For now, my fingers are crossed. Why hide this from me? It's silly. Don't you know how happy I'd be? How much for the red one? This one? No, the other one. 1 5 francs. You're crazy, Felix! Why lower your prices? - I don't know. You sold the other one for 30. I liked the other one. I don't care about this one. But he doesn't know that you didn't like it much. I'll do what I want. It's 1 5 francs. It's too late! Your kid can't appreciate your commercial strategies. He's a little reluctant, but I'm not giving up. Dad, come here! Grandpa is buying drinks. Good news! Go on. I'll watch the stand. Keep an eye on Felix. He's underselling his toys. Don't worry. Good evening, Luc. - Good evening, sir. Have some champagne with us? Gladly. What's the occasion? That's for Vincent to say. - Stop. I have nothing to tell. He's changing jobs. He won't say any more. Really, Vincent? - No... He's dreaming. I know you. Nothing's concrete. Hello, stranger! - How are you? Nice to see you. Missed you at Patrick's birthday. - It's nice to be missed. How's the painting? - Don't ask! Have you moved? 2 weeks ago... You're well-informed. We're having a housewarming next month. Can we count on you? Why not? All of you come have a drink with us. Let's celebrate Vincent's new job! It's funny Muriel never mentioned it. That's because nothing is set yet. So what's the job? - He still won't tell us! Will you consult again? - No thanks! It has something to do with Switzerland. The mystery's solved. He'll work in a bank. Maybe not. The most important thing is to be paid in Swiss francs. In Geneva? You'll all see. Are you changing jobs? I don't know, honey. What can I get you? A cola for me. I'll share with her. You'll have champagne with us! That's enough! All these secrets! Don't get your hopes up. You'll only be disappointed. I'm no idiot. If you weren't sure, you wouldn't have said anything. But I didn't say anything! Do they know at the office? You can't just drop them like that! OK, I gave my notice a month ago... Well, now we can toast in peace! I can't believe you! But this is good news, Muriel! When did you plan on telling me? This is silly, Muriel. Really! When do you start? I'm going back to Switzerland this week to formalise my contract. So, you start soon? And you'll be away during the week? I knew you'd react like this. That's why I was vague. How should I react? We hardly see each other. For a while now, I've hated my job. You must have noticed. I'm really suffocating. What are you talking about? I'm certainly not criticising you for wanting to change jobs. So I didn't handle it well. But this is a chance for me. It's a really interesting job. You'll be surprised. I feel like I've regained some enthusiasm. I'm happy foryou. It's great to change one's life. But I'll be doing the same as always. Housework, the kids... Don't play dumb. You see the role I'm stuck with. I never imagined myself like this. Why not break out of that? Seriously, I'll be making a lot of money. You could do something else... Yes, I could go back to school, become a professor. No, I know you're tired of your job. You must have ambitions other than teaching... 50 yards from home, always the same faces... What's wrong? Nothing. It's just that... I never meant to say that my life was hell. I'll stop complaining. I guess I'm just jealous. Change is important for me. And not only for me. You'll see. Everything will change between us. Won't you believe me? I don't know. You've got to trust me. That little brat. Acting like he doesn't see us! Morning! - How are you? Fine and you? - Any packages for me? Nothing yet, but I'll send it over as soon as it arrives. Have a good day. Hello. - Hello. An image problem is present in the African countries. In the supplied documentation, you'll find countries listed in order of tendency to create a business-friendly environment... an investment-favourable climate. No surprise to find South Africa at the top followed by Morocco and Egypt. However, our research revealed other vital information on the indications of an investment-favourable climate. The most frequently cited indications were: Healthy government... Strong regulatory setting... Law enforcement and social stability are the third most important things. Only administrative details to work out now. I'll visit the offices, get to know the departments... Yes, things are moving fast, to say the least! I could be starting on Monday! We'll talk this weekend, OK? - Sir... I've got to go. Kiss, kiss, bye. Hello, sir. - Hello, sir. Do you work here, sir? - No. Maybe you have an appointment? Not really. I just left one. With whom? So I'm not allowed to stay here? No, it's just that... You've been here for an hour, sir. I'll be on my way. I don't mean to chase you off. - No problem. Weren't you given a pass at reception? Don't worry about it. I'm sorry. This isn't a public space. Note on the dynamic evolution between UCDI and NGO. Note on the dynamic evolution between UCDI and NGO. A number of internal agency procedures were revised in order to encourage increased implication of NGO in UCDI programs and projects. The Secretary General of UCDI... Mr Walter Ribeiro, recalled in the last forum that the agency-NGO collaboration completed more than 800 projects. This, in direct coordination with local chambers of commerce... Go Julien! Felix, we'll wait for him here. He's still busy. Well done, young man! I thought he'd take you down. He was 1 0 cm taller. But he's a big wimp. Fight me! Whythe hurry? - Can't miss the bus. Not coming with us? - I made other plans. We drove 200 miles. - Hey, I didn't ask you to! I know I spend more time in Switzerland than with you. It's not easy for any of us. - It doesn't bother me. How did you do that? - Happened in the match. When he grabbed you. Are you happy? - Yeah, I felt good out there. What a show off! But you were good. It was super... Now run along. We're eating at your grandparents. - You don't really think he'll come! Felix, come back here! Are you sure there isn't anotherway? What otherway? Maybe... If you insist, you could get housing. Surely the UN has housing to offerto its executives. Maybe for other organisations, but not in my case. All my colleagues are in the same situation. You're sure it isn't a mistake? How irritating! It's as if I'm forcing you. Take it easy. - Listen, Dad... I only need 200,000 francs to get set up. If you don't want to, I'll find anotherway. Don't use that tone with me. Couldn't you rent something? It's just going to increase your household bills. Exactly. That's why we called on you. We did the calculations. With Vincent's housing stipends, we could reimburse you over 2 years. We'd be saving money if he didn't stay in a hotel. You've made your point! I can see you've done your research. 200,000? That will do it. What are you doing? Giving money to your father. Will you give me some, too? Felix, really! - You cheeky boy! By giving to your father, I'm also giving to you. Thanks, Dad. - Here, that's for you. But I expect a thank you kiss. Look, Mum! See what I made? Very nice... Let's go. So soon? We've hardly spoken! I'm sorry, but the kids are really tired. You didn't tell me how your job is going. Yes, verywell. Shoes on, Felix. I had dinnerwith Fremont recently. His face when I told him you worked forthe UN! You don't miss a chance to tell people, do you? Hold on... International posts are privileged. Something to be proud of. Oh, yes... We're like princes. There are times... It's almost shocking. The other day, I was on the phone to a guy in Mozambique. He's fighting to reconstruct theirtelecommunications network. Suddenly I looked around me... All the marble, the glass building... All the space... I hope you're not complaining. No, but it's just surrealistic. Let's go, Alice. It's very nice to see you so enthusiastic. Good night, Dad. Natural resources are the main interest of foreign investors, although there is an influx toward industry and service. Privatisation results in attracting direct foreign investment to Africa, more so during the 90s than in previous decades. Between 1 990 and 1 998, there was more privatisation in South Africa, 1.4 billion dollars... Ghana, 769 million dollars... Nigeria, 500 million dollars... Zambia, 420 million dollars, and the Ivory Coast, 373 million dollars. Theytook mytruck. Theytook me someplace. I was there for half an hour. I was scared, really scared. I prayed in the sleeper. The gun was here the whole time. They took all my money and credit cards. They took me back. They took my jacket and... - They left you like that? - In my underwear! Fred, I have good reason to be cautious... I see canned ravioli when I think of you. You still have that butane burner? No, I don't trust you. I'd rather go to a restaurant. Yeah, my job is going well. I'll tell you all about it. I've got a proposal foryou. I'd rathertalk about it later. I'll arrive in Grenoble around 6. That OK foryou? OK, Fred... See you at the Novotel. See you later. Fred, you can't abandon us! - I'll be right back. I'm really happy to see you. Me, too. I just need a couple minutes for a group photo. Go on. I understand. Mr Pradal, this is Vincent Renault. Hello, Vincent. - Hello, sir. Vincent worked for years at DR Consulting. Very good. He's left the area. We lost contact for a while. So it's a reunion! - Sort of... So, where to? You can all go to the patio. I'll have them light it. Excuse me... Are you coming? - No, it's cold. I just took a chance and it worked out. It's all up to you. There are so many businesses gravitating around the UN. They always need new collaborators. As if they're looking for me! I don't have the right profile. No international experience. Think again! What's needed are collaborators... Consultants with experience in the private sector. If ever I need to expand my team, I'd surely think of you. I complain about my job, but it doesn't matter. I'm not ambitious. I could never be passionate about a job. But you enjoy their company? - No, you saved me from them! He insisted we have dinner together. Give me a break! I need my space. It's not easy. But the less I do, the more bored I get. Sometimes after work, I just can't go home. I have to see people. Go out, feel like I did something with my day. Give myself some silly little pleasure. I tend to forget that all that costs money. That's why your investment offer... Well, I'm interested. But I don't have a whole lot put aside. 50,000 francs in savings... Don't know if it's worth it. I swear it's worth it! I'm not good at budgeting or saving either. That's exactly why this is good for us. I guess I didn't look at it that way. This investment is just an example. Trust me, I don't go into things blindly. The colleague who let me in on it... He only works with Eastern Europe. He's an expert. He'll run the whole thing. The money he made in 2 years! Unbelievable! Isn't it a big risk foryou? Officially, you're not allowed to carry cash in the diplomatic case. But nobody checks. So no real danger. I'll have the money tomorrow morning. No good for me. I'm leaving for Geneva. Here's what we'll do... We'll meet up next week. Sounds good. Monday? Perfect. At 9? - 9 it is. Bye, Fred. See you Monday. Have a safe trip. Sir! Please lower your window. Good evening, sir. This is a private lot. Did you know that? This is a hotel, sir. Lots of rooms to sleep in. You can't stay on the lot. Very funny! Listen, Sir, I tried the polite way. Now get out of here! Didn't take long to get to impolite. Get a move on! Go on! Get out! All right, all right... Sure you won't come along, Julien? Is there a code? Hang up, Julien. I'm speaking to you! I have to go. Bye. We gave you that phone so your mother could reach you. Not to spend hours with friends. I don't want to go shopping. I have other plans. Really? And what are those plans? Nothing special. Call some friends... Maybe go to the movies. So, you're doing nothing, then? Here, Julien... What are you doing, Vincent? This is between Julien and I. 500 francs to a kid! That's a lot of money. He's old enough to buy clothes on his own. You're dreaming if you think he'll use it to buy clothes! I always choose them anyway. Don't get used to it. This is an exceptional gift. I don't like red! Try on the red. We'll find another color, OK? It looks nice on you. Does it feel all right? Yeah... No... You'll neverwear it. That's the one I like! I'd preferto buyyou something simple you'd wear more often. Mum, just let me buy herthe trousers. Find something else you want to buy for her. I don't mind buying the trousers. Isn't that Jeffrey over there? Yes, it's him. Hey, Vincent. How are you? - Very well, and you? I'm fine... My wife, Elizabeth. Our little Lola. My wife, Muriel. I think we've met before? Yes, 2 or 3 years ago. I told Vincent you looked familiar. Sure you're all right? - Yes, I'm fine. Should we have a smoke? - If you'd like. I didn't want to harass you. My calls were only to help you. Help me? Did you listen to my messages? Of course, I heard them. I contacted other companies and they're ready to hire you. It's OK. How OK? I'm fine. Why do you insist? Vincent, you were fired. Then you completely disappear. It's normal I should be concerned. It's not normal. We worked together, that's all. Is this a joke? Weren't we really close? We ate lunch together daily for 1 0 years. All that overtime together... Isn't that something? That's in the past. I have a new job. What? It's going really well. Why didn't you tell me? You're really strange. And yourwife? - Leave her alone. You said she was doing badly. Was she miraculously cured of her depression? She doesn't know that I've been let go. What? - She thinks I resigned. You're crazy! That's stupid. Your opinion doesn't interest me. I'm fine. What else matters? Leave me alone. Is that clear? They look like twins! How are you, Vincent? And you? - Real good. This is Philippe. Have a seat. Do you remember Philippe? I'm not sure... He was one year after us. No, I don't remember. Sorry. It might come to me. - I hope so. I filled him in. Hope it's no problem. No, but my first priority has been to contact people that I know. Easier to keep track of. Philippe is interested. Very much so. He's a better client. He's got plenty of money. Plenty of money! Probably about 300,000 francs. - See what I mean? That's no problem at all! Did Fred explain what to expect? He told me in basic terms. I'd like to know more. Of course! So spelled out, we give money, an account is opened. The money works... And then? How do we follow the outcome? Do you send bank statements? I made that clear to Fred. You receive no statements. It's very clear to me. - Not to me! Listen... We must be clear on this. The accounts are numbered. They're unofficial. Not really legal. - I got that. For now, of course... I'll stay in touch, keep you posted. Keep a close eye on things. I told him about all the money you'll make off us. Great, so he'll make money off us. But I need more than that. I'm interested, but I need more. To invest 300,000 francs... I need some kind of paper... A receipt... Something! Are you joking? For 300,000 francs! No, Fred, he's right. I'll sign something for you, too. It's OK. I really don't need it. Well, I do! These... are forms to open an account. Read them carefully. Think it over, Philippe. Don't get involved if you're not sure. I need some time. I'm interested, but I'd like to look this over. Calmly, with a clear head. I suggest meeting again. But I am interested. Hello. - Hello. I'd like to speak to you if you have time. About what? Maybe about Switzerland. Switzerland? - Yes. I don't really have the time today. I have a lot of work this week. I've got all the time in the world. Call me whenever you want. See you soon. - Thanks. The UCDIand France have signed an investment agreement for a project to reinforce training in internationalcommerce for Bnin, Mali and Burkina-Faso, The amount is 2,284,000 francs, The agreement arranges for:, 1) creating specialised training centres 2) organising seminars, both national and regional, on international commerce issues, 3) conceiving, adapting and updating multidisciplinary teaching units that respond to the needs of executives in public and private sectors, Enjoy it! Does Mum know? No, I want to surprise her. How much did it cost? 1 45,000 francs. So it was used? Well, it's almost new. Jerome's dad paid 330,000. Well, I'm not Jerome's dad. Sorry, Julien, I've got another call. Call you tomorrow. OK, Dad. Bye. Bye. Kisses. Who is it? Don't you recognise me? Guess! Is that Nono? You got it! Nothing to say? Where are you? What do you mean? Did I wake you? I'm just surprised, that's all. Fred told me you've been around Grenoble. You could have at least called. Fred didn't tell me you two were in touch. So when can you come by? I don't think I can. I'm sorry. That's too bad. Maybe Friday. Around 6 pm. We'll expect you for dinner. Friday's perfect. Still recognise me? - Of course, I do. He's here! Jeanne. - Vincent. Nice to meet you. - It's my pleasure. You shouldn't have. It's OK. He's got the money. So that's Julie. - Hi, Julie. Say hello to Vincent, Julie. He won't bite! What's wrong? Usually never so shy. That suit scares her! Don't make fun of me! Come on in... - Let me take your coat. I'll put the flowers in a vase. Let me show you the apartment. This here... This is my refuge. You've got a lot of equipment. You've made a real sound studio. It's not professional equipment. But it's a start. Do you give concerts? - No. Just play for myself orwith friends. Let's hear something. - I'm not ready yet. I'd really like to hear. But I'm still a little nervous. I'd ratheryou listen when it's ready. So what else are you up to? Working? A lot. I'm always working. - I see... You're a kept man! - Not at all. I'm happyto work. He concentrates on his music and takes care of the little one. He'll soon be calling me a pimp! Really, it's true... Geneva isn't a very lively city. It's very cosmopolitan. But I'm always seeing the same faces. Either major corporate guys or bankers. Movers and shakers like you. Stop kidding around. I don't shake up a whole lot. But your job seems so interesting. It must be so gratifying to be helping out Africa. Better than working for some private company. Yes, I'm very happy. But I've only had the post for a month and a half. I don't feel as if I've helped yet. Don't be so modest. It's great what you do. - You're making fun again. Not at all. I'm sincerely happy foryou! I think it's true. He admires you a lot! Don't go too far. It'll go to his head. You call that admiration? I didn't invite you here to declare my love! It's betterthan that. I feel much better. Don't you know what I mean? Fred told me about the Swiss venture. Really? I never thought you'd be interested. Why shouldn't I be? You told Fred, Serge and who knows how many others. Can't I want money? Sorry, I just never thought... In fact, we're very interested. We put a little money aside. Only 1 2,000 francs, but... I don't want to talk about this. Not with you two! Why not? We want to. What is it? 1 2,000 isn't enough? It's not that. But small sums don't make a whole lot. I can't lie to you. - Those 1 2,000... You can't do much with 1 2,000 francs. I really don't know. You might need to have it available on your account. You must know it can't be recuperated quickly if times get tough. That's just it. We've been holding it for years in case times get tough. It's getting a little absurd. I'm getting the impression this is making you uneasy. It shouldn't! I'd like to do something with you. What are you afraid of? Nothing... Ifyou want to... Give him the cheque and get it overwith. Or do you prefer cash? Not for a sum like that. I'll put it in my account instead of opening one foryou. I hope you both realise... I'm not promising miracles. Don't expect a gold mine. That's not what Fred told us. I'll give you a receipt. Don't bother, Vincent. We don't need a receipt from you. Hey, Dad. You scared me. It's late for you to be out. - It's OK. It's cool! Take me for a ride? I'm dead tired. Just a quick ride. It's really late. Your mother must be worried. She knows. I was at a friend's. Anyway, she trusts me. Fine, but I don't want you running around at night. That's that. Good night, Julien. - Good night. Are you coming to bed? I'm not sleepy. And I didn't want to wake you. Things aren't going the way I had hoped. I knew it would take time to adapt. I didn't think it would be this hard. You only started a few weeks ago. Doesn't it take some time to settle in? Don't you think so? I get along well with my colleagues. That's not the problem. They're easy to talk to. Good atmosphere. But still perverse. That makes lying easy, tell myself everything's fine. That's a lie. I'm afraid I'll disappoint. Afraid of what? Afraid I'll disappoint. Afraid I won't make the grade. You've had these worries before, but you always handle it. I can't handle anything right now. I'm just being carried along. Sometimes I don't even know what I'm supposed to do. Nor what's expected of me. So I start to panic. A simple phone call becomes overwhelming. This week, I went from meeting to meeting. No time to think things over or take a step back. I can't think anymore. My mind is blank. I look around me... At the people I supposedly work with. I only see total strangers. Like my mind going blank... Sorry. I'm just tired. Hello. I didn't want to wake you. It's OK. I just dozed off. I worked late last night. Can we talk? Yes, of course. Thanks, Fati. - You're welcome. So tell me about it... How does it work? I'm in contact with a small bank via a colleague. It handles Russian investments. That makes me nervous. Isn't that risky? Investment in emerging markets? That makes it interesting. 400% gains on the Moscow market of 1 998... You won't find that anywhere else. That's one way to look at it. But don't forget: the same market, that same year... Iost 200%% of its value in a single day. I never said there weren't risks. I don't know... You're more convincing with your friends. I don't know... You're the one who contacted me. I didn't mean to offend you. Sorry, really sorry... Your story just isn't clear. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Is something wrong? - I'll be right back. I'll take care of it. Don't worry. Excuse me... Feeling better? - Yes, I'm fine. Have a seat. I think we've met before! Maybe. No, I'm sure. You slept in the car park. I kicked him out before. I think you're mistaken. I don't make mistakes. I memorise faces. It's OK, Stan... I'm talking with the gentleman. OK, Jean-Michel. Would you like something else? The same thing. Fati! Two coffees, please. I started to get suspicious. That last time when you were with friends... I thought it was weird. You didn't seem to believe what you were saying. Is there any truth in your story? Anything? I don't know... I don't know you... Let's start from the beginning... You aren't working in Switzerland? I'm out of a job for about... 3 months, 3 and 1 /2... - You're on the dole? - Not even. I haven't gotten around to that. My wife doesn't know. None of my family knows. What about the money your friends give you? Wait a minute! We're just talking. You seem all right. I'm not a policeman. You can't really think that your story can last? One day your friends will want their money. Six months, maybe a year. What will you do then? I know it won't last long. I know... But... it buys me some time. For now... You're out of your mind. Aside from the ones I've seen, have you convinced many people? A few, yes. I'm in touch with about a dozen persons. All friends of yours? More or less... Acquaintances... So, what should we do now? Hi, Sylvie. Come in. Don't leave the door open. Doors should be open or closed. I insist that that one stays closed. Have a seat. Relax. See this watch? 1 5,000 francs in France. I pay 200 in Poland. I resell them for 1 000. Minimum quantities of 1 00. Far from the 200%% risks of emerging markets. Watches... Scarves... T-shirts... A little bulky. But they sell well. Pens... Sunglasses... All this makes a lot of money. That's whyyour Swiss story interested me. Stan gives me a hand, but that's not enough. So what I'm proposing you is a place in my organisation. Modest, but lucrative, as you can imagine. I don't think I'm interested. You don't seem to have many other options. Have you heard of training for development? Leave out the terminology! Quiet down or it's off to bed! I don't want to hear it! Play quietly, OK? You're wrong, Dad. I'll agree that training for development might sound self-important. But it's no empty term. I was really surprised to see that the UN-NGO Committee uses only six UN representatives out of 26 persons. The other 20 persons are NGO members. So those in the field are in charge of showing us local situations. I know all about those outfits. It's mostly about never-ending meetings without any results! For example... What decisions are made? - To put it simply... We help create companies in developing countries. It's a little more complicated than just that. We propose financing to start up the company. But we also follow up as executive consultants. Are you dreaming? Consulting in Africa! So you really believe that? Not just beliefs, I see it in action. What's really interesting is your specific task... That fairtrade stuff. That's used for coffee. - Don't believe it... That's nonsense! All these small private initiatives never solved the problems of under-developed nations. We all know there's no global answer to the problem. I know, Muriel. - Just forget it! It's important to attempt these efforts. It's good that Vincent is involved. But it won't change the world. Typical remark of an old arse! That's enough, Vincent. Don't be silly. I'm not attacking you. If anyone is happy for your post, it's me. But if we're not allowed to talk about your job... Stop it. That's enough! It's time for bed. Get to bed. Tonight you're going to bed early. Good night, kids. Another kiss, Mom! - Go to sleep! Are you all settled in your apartment? Not much decor, but it's comfortable. Lots of light? Yes, it's very nice. But I'm mostly there at night. There is a view of the lake if I stretch my neck far enough. Do you cook when you're alone? I usually just order pizzas. I never invite anyone over, so the kitchen isn't fully equipped. Only a cafetiere for the mornings. Just like a bachelor! We could go and visit you. If you'd like. But Geneva isn't very beautiful. We already know Geneva! We're not interested in the city. We want to see your apartment. See how you're living. Whatever you want... After all the money I put into that apartment! I think I'm allowed to visit! Don't start! It cost me a bit to get settled in and I had to change cars. But I can start paying you back next month. That's not what your father meant. We'd just like to go and spend a day with you. Vincent promised to take me soon. I'll tell you all about it. Good. It's been a long time since the two of you went away. Without the kids! That will do us some good. I'll go and kiss the kids. They're probably already asleep. What are you doing, Dad? Dad? The border is coming up. Drive slowly. The road isn't cleared of snow. You're certainly focused! I love to drive. When I first started working, driving was my favourite part. Alone in the car... Thinking about nothing... Smoking and listening to music... I could do it for hours. I think the onlything I really liked about my job was the trips. That ended up turning against me. It felt so good in my car, I had difficulty leaving it. Sometimes I drove 200 miles for an appointment. At the last minute, without thinking, I wouldn't turn off. I just kept driving. My boss started to get annoyed. But things could have been worse. They felt I no longer fit in. No one tried to keep me. Negotiating my departure was easy. Why didn't you tell your wife? I don't know... Maybe it was just easier to play along. 3 cartons for tomorrow. Not before 1 1. I'm tired. I'll get the other 3. 300 watches! Not bad! We'll straighten up later. Let's get something to eat. Everything OK? I was afraid you wouldn't be here. What about your apartment? We're not headed for the city. What are you up to? Patience... I've got a surprise. - Now I'm really scared! What's all that for? A short hike in the mountains. I see you've thought of everything. Come on. - It's cold! This way, I can tell you... the whole truth... Now... The feet, the legs... OK. Too bad you've lost those nice thighs! That... OK. - Whew! Getting a little thicker up here, but I like it. There's something that bothers me. Stomach? - No, not that. Yourtits are starting to sag. You're so harsh! Mine are sagging, too. Why should you be spared? Will we see your apartment tomorrow? You really want to? That's partly the reason I came! But I guess we don't have to. You don't seem like you want to. What's going on? Is your job getting you down? I want you to tell me if something is bothering you. No, it's not that. I want to be with you, away from all that. The apartment isn't important. What's wrong in Geneva? Everything is fine. You won't talk about it? Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Did you think you had lost me? Admit it's strange. See it from Philippe's point of view. We gave the money 2 months ago and we have hardly any news. I did keep you updated. What did Philippe expect after 2 months? He gave you 1 50,000 francs. He has the right to ask for specifics. I answered your questions. I gave you updates on the values. What more does he want? I think he was hoping to be in direct contact with the bank. That would be more practical. Does he want the number? Yeah, I think so. That's out of the question. He mustn't call the bank from France. I called you for some explanation. I have to tell you... I'm perplexed. So Philippe wants his money back. Is that it? Admit that you're vague. No problem, I'll reimburse him! I don't think you understand. He won't be the only one. I understand perfectly well. You're the one who's suspicious. I have no problem giving you both your money back! This is really upsetting. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to think. I don't know what to say either. I never knew we'd make so much money! Take your share. It's the end of the month. How much did we say? You know it's 40,000! Would you mind giving me an advance? How much? Double. Wow! You're not shy! What's happening? Paying your friends back? Yeah, that's it. Well, go on. What's this notebook? What? The orange notebook? My biography. Read it. I have nothing to hide. So you worked in public relations? For a while. I had a friend in politics. His party needed money. And so did I! We schemed around together. I was stupid, a little naive. I took a bit of dough on the way. A fine of 1,500,000 francs! Yes. And locked up for a year. But I shouldn't complain. My daughter Annie made this notebook. She calls it my pressbook. She pasted and noted... The whole story. She did a good job. I didn't know you had a daughter. 1 9 years old... I don't see her much anymore. I get the impression she liked me better when I was in prison. Must be strange to lose everything overnight. Sure. I don't feel any worse today. It was hard at first. But now... I feel free of all that. Today I'll only take good merchandise. Last time, 25%% was defective. Don't make me cry! Do you want to see the defects? You sell enough. You can afford it. In any case, this business is risky. So 500 polos... - Hi, darling. How are you? I had a good weekend, too. I felt better than ever. Hold on, darling. Just a second... Hello. Sure you're all right? I promise we'll do it again. We'll go back this Spring. I'm waiting for a meeting. As usual, everyone is late. Hello, Muriel. Just a colleague. Forget it. How are you, Muriel? Sure, he knows your name. I do speak about you. I know lots about you. Shut up! I'd love to meet you sometime. She'd like to meet you, too. Here's 30,000. I'll give you the rest later. I'll call you later tonight. What's going on, Muriel? I miss you, too. Are you all right? You sound a little strange. I sound strange? I don't think so. I've got to go stop the kids from fighting. I've got to go referee. I love you, too. Jeff, I'm passing you a call to your office. Thanks. Take your owed days! - Easily said. Yes, I remember. Is Vincent OK? I don't know. Hold on... Daddy! Daddy! Why did you choose judo instead of another discipline? Like Aikido or Tae Kwon Dwe? Tae Kwon Do! - Are you making fun of me? Those are trendy sports. All that interior equilibrium! I know what you mean. You don't like that New Age stuff. It's too showy. Like those things... That close combat stuff... I won't allow it! - No need. That doesn't interest me. Those guys are scary. Don't you want to be like Jean-Claude Van Damme? Julien forgot to mention that judo takes up all his time. You can't complain. I get good grades. Be grateful, Vincent. You have a kid with a passion. If I had a kid, I'd want him to dream about the future. What do you do exactly? Pardon me? Sorry, I was still thinking about Aikido. I have no idea what you do. Do you work in his department? It's rare for Vincent to bring home a colleague. I'll tell you right away. I'm lucky enough not to work with him. I'm the lucky one! We know each other because we're on the same floor. I work in connection with the European Commission... Their anti-fraud sector. You fight drug traffic? You like that idea! But I deal with fake goods. That's less serious. I fight to show how serious it is. It's no minor crime. If I see Reeboks at half-price, it makes no difference to me. The poor quality quickly wears out. What do you know? My friends have fake ones just as solid as the real thing. Your Dad might not know. But I guarantee you it's shit! Run around the track 3 times and the soles wear out! Plus it's illegal. That's serious! That wouldn't stop me if I knew where to find Reeboks at half-price. I'd buy them. If you really like sports shoes, then you go to Italy. Around Naples. Are they specialists? Naples specialises in clothes. T-shirts, sweats. Florence would interest you less. They handle leather goods. Turin is more luxury items. Jewellery, precious metals, watches. If you know all that, then why not stop them? It's not that easy. We know of 200 factories in Tuscany alone that makes imitations. Everything's out in the open. They also make legal products. That's why it's not easy. How to distinguish between the legal and parallel economies? It's a problem. Is something wrong, Muriel? I'm fine... I felt a little dizzy. Do you want to take a rest? I'm fine. I guess I drank too much. Don't you want some air? It's a little warm in here. No, it's OK. I'll go with you. - Not necessary. I spoke to Jeffrey. What does he want now? We spoke... Where's Jean-Michel? He had breakfast and went up for a shower. The van is loaded. You can go. Can I have a coffee, Fati? Of course. Stan, come here! What is that asshole doing? See your friend? - What's wrong? Take a look! What's going on? Has he flipped? Forget it. What are you doing here? Sorry, I was just passing by. You should have phoned. Come and have a bite with us. Sorry, I don't have the time. I'm just dropping this off. What is it? Surprise... Your money with interest. 1 5,000 francs. Why bring it to me now? Please don't ask for explanations. You can't just leave like that! 3000 francs interest in 3 months! Why stop? I have to stop. Is something wrong? No, don't worry. I'm not worried, but you seem worried. I feel a little responsible. If it's the money, it really doesn't matter. But you need this money. You and Jeanne can't just let yourselves... Be careful with your money. What's all this about? What do you mean? We're friends, like Fred. Tell us what's wrong. I'll call you, OK? Are you happy? Hi, Vincent. - You couldn't leave Muriel alone? She called me. What? - Yes, she called me. Haven't you messed up enough? What? You're not well. It's obvious. What are you talking about? That's just it. I'm trying to understand. Don't touch me! Take it easy! Forget about me! Did you hear? You know what? You're ridiculous! You idiot! Hello, we're not home now. Leave us a message and we'll get back to you. Muriel, it's me... I've had a really bad day. I don't feel well. I've decided to come home. I'm on the road. I'll be back around 9::30 or 1 0. I hope you'll all be there. I love you. Daddy's home! Hey, little monster. How was school? Was the teacher nice? I had a fight with Youssouf. - Were you hurt? No, he got hurt. Hi, Alice. How's my girl? Did you have a good day? Yes. Mommy's making pasta. - Really? I don't like it. You won't give us trouble, will you? She always says that, but then she's happy to eat it. Hello, you. Where's Julien? In his room. Julien? He'll come down soon. Julien, are you coming? What are you doing? I'm calling Julien! Do you need help, Muriel? It's OK. It's almost ready. Your hair has gotten long! No, it hasn't! Yes, time for a haircut. I don't want to go! You can't stay like that. I can stay like that! Did you fight with your sister? No fights. I didn't fight, crazy man! Talking like that to me, you're crazy. Crazy isn't a bad word. But it's not very nice. Is Julien coming down? Julien, will you come down? It's almost ready. You're sleepy. Julien, come down. Your father's home. I don't want to see him. Supper's ready. Come down. I'm not hungry. I don't want to see him. I'm not disturbing anyone! - I still want you to come down. But I don't want to see him! Stop insisting. What's wrong with him? Don't make matters more complicated. I won't eat with him. He's a bastard! You sit and face him! He makes me sick! That's enough! - Leave me alone! Why doesn't he want to come down? Leave him, he's not hungry. Let me speak to him. - Let him be. Why? Can't I speak to my son? Why won't you say anything? What's wrong with all of you? Are you scared of me? You're scared, is that it? What's wrong? Tell me! You know what's wrong! No, tell me! You know... You bullshit us! What? You laughed at us! What's wrong? Just tell me. What's different? Was I away too much? Didn't I take care of all of you? So... That's it... It took me some time. You know, it's not that easy. So you think I'm a bastard? But nothing changed foryou. Are you aware of that? I did that so you could live like nothing happened... I could have just run off. You know that? I could have run off. Let him go. Let him go. You're scaring him. Come on... We'll talk, just the two of us. I have nothing to say. What do you want? I have nothing to say. Your father is coming by. He wants to talk. What the hell is he coming here for? Did you ask him to come? I don't feel like seeing him. I'm really sorry. What are you sorry about? Stop it, Vincent. I don't understand why he's coming here. I have nothing to say. I'm just tired. You can't possibly know how tired I am. I think I just won't go to work this week. I need a rest. What are you all doing there? Are you just going to watch me all night? You're all... completely sick! Can you hear... Don't hang up! Where are you? It's not serious, you know? Money problems can be worked out. If you don't want to talk, we won't talk. You don't have to explain anything. This will be forgotten in a month. We all know that! Just answer us... Vincent, it's me. I'm alone. Just us two. Won't you answer me? Have you stopped driving? What's happening? Can't you say something? I'm sure you're listening. Ifyou're listening, it must mean you'll speak to me. Right? I want to be with you. I miss you. Don't destroy everything... Don't leave me all alone... I'm tired, Vincent. I love you. I was at DR Consulting for 5 years. It was a learning experience. What position did you hold? I was a financial consultant. I decided to go to Partner. And you stayed on 1 1 years? Right. 1 1 years with Partner is good experience. But you decided to leave? Can you tell me why? I felt I was going around in circles. I didn't see any new opportunities. I'm someone who functions on enthusiasm. You stopped working for 7 months! What happened? You hadn't prepared your departure... I did a lot of prospecting in that period. I chose to take my time and find a job which would fully satisfy me. I understand. That's a quality... to know how to wait. Especially after 1 1 years with the same company. It's important to reflect on the right moment. Knowing what we can give to and what we expect of a company. Your father says you' re not short on ambition. I think those things are connected. Well, that's what he says. Ambition is what drives a career. We're offering you a high position. A new area we've begun to develop. We'll invest heavily. A strategic financial adventure... And, at least in our eyes, a human adventure. You'll have a team of 8 persons. A team you'll have to mould. We're offering you many challenges. Your personal investment is required. That is, if you are chosen. To be clear... I'm not trying to pressure you. I just won't minimise yourtask. But I'm not scared. Then let's go overthe details,,,
