You're better on that horn of yours than anyone we've ever had. But when it comes to reading... Mr. Pecolm, music on paper don't mean nothing to me. Well, I'm afraid you're wasting your time here. You mustn't feel ashamed, Reggie. I ain't exactly ashamed. Is just thinking how I was gonna tell my mammy, Ella. She wants me to be a teacher. Well, would you like me to break the news to her kinda gentle like? Nobody breaks no news to my mammy gently like. I'll tell her myself, slow and easy. - Hello, Ella. - Hello. Nothing today? Nothing. I say there, is this the home of Mr. Latimer, the architect? - Sure is, sir. - Is he in? He is and he ain't. Is you a bill collector? (laughing) No, I'm just an old friend from Chicago. He's in. (piano playing) Sorry, Mr. George, you've got some foreigners from Chicago. Be with you in a second, Ella. Beautiful, my dear. - Now, if you'll excuse me. - You are excused. Hello, George. Well, Steve Porter, how are you? I'm certainly glad to see you. Hello, Paul. You certainly have grown. Why, I remember when you couldn't even walk. Well, Steve, how's Chicago? What are you doing in New Orleans? Staying for dinner, of course. Thanks, George, we'd like to. Darling, this is my friend Mr. Porter, his son, Paul. This is my daughter, Kit. How do you do, sir? How do you do, Paul? How do you do? - Do you play the piano? - Uh-huh. Would you like to hear me play some real New Orleans music? Well, I don't mind.

What would you like for dinner? - Surprise me. - I'll surprise you right now. Mr. Jack says he won't let us charge no more groceries. Ella, from this moment on, I forbid you to patronise Mr. Jack's establishment. Go somewhere else and open a charge account. - Word gets around awful fast in this here town. - Then pay cash. That's the whole idea I've been trying to convey to ya. That's what I call real Southern hospitality. You serve a marvellous dinner, and your neighbour supplied the music, it's wonderful. Oh, those European waltzes, I don't care for them. Kit... how about some real New Orleans music? I'd love to. Come, Paul. - No! I don't wanna hear any New Orleans music. - Paul! (chuckling) Steve, let's have a cognac. Thanks, I'd love it. Well, George, what about coming to Chicago? Chicago? What would I do in Chicago, pick pockets? (chuckling) Well, you could start off by building a house for me. - Yes, and then what? - And then, you know, as the head of one of Chicago's biggest investment firms, I could help you a great deal. Thanks, Steve. I like it here. You'd like it in Chicago, too. Let me show you something. There's New Orleans, reckless daughter of the Mississippi. By day, she looks no different than other towns. At night, she suddenly springs to life. It's a rough, old, charming town. And she's been battered and bruised, praised and damned by the scum of the land and the flower of the earth. Her streets have been sprinkled with the blood of saints and sinners. Every night she dies like an old man, only to be born each morning a husky, laughing baby built on mud... sand and mud. But, beneath it all, she's got a foundation that's solid and strong enough to build up to the stars. A heart that beats with life. That's very nice for a poet, but not very profitable for your business. Ah! (chuckling) Business, business, business. Steve, my family hasn't been tainted by a businessman since Louis Napoleon. If you don't care for yourself, George, that's quite all right, but you should think of Kit. Kit? She has no mother. Excuse me, Mr. George, anything else before I go to church? No, Ella, uh, by the way, how is the Reverend getting along with his collection? - Fine, Mr. George. I designed the little church for these people. And you'll wait for the collections? Yes, and tonight we's called on the Lord to come down and loosen some of them tight pockets. And the Lord gonna do it, too. Yes, sir, tonight's the night. Me and the Reverend and the Lord got a little scheme and we gonna bust them skinflints wide open. And I'm gonna practise to this here ol' horn. Blow them stars right out of the sky. When you get ready to pop them stars out, Reggie, get that fair one for me. (giggling) She's got a mighty mean bad luck gleam in her eye, but I'll get it for ya. - No matter how long it takes, I'll get it. - Reggie! - Come along. - Where are you going, Ella? I'm gonna put a little religion in some of these heathens. Where are you going with that ladder, Reggie? Shh, that's a secret. Come on, we'll follow him. (overlapping praying) That King Jeffers, when he oughta be here playing Angel Gabriel, he's possibly down in some low dive playin' that horn of his'n, tempting deceit. Perish your words, Reverend, I figured that sinner might go astray, so I brought my Reggie to blow his horn. Blowing a horn like Gabriel ain't no easy job for a little boy.

Every once in a great while, the Lord takes a tiny little spark and drops it inside of someone. That spark can be snuffed out...

I don't know much about folks in this big city, but back home, in New Orleans, nothing like this could happen.

Thank you. Just one moment. My good woman, you say you've raised this child, is that true? - Mostly, sir. I suppose that from time to time you taught the defendant music as well as other things? It could be, Your Honour. Street music and songs from around the river front. Could be, sir. Your Honour, that is exactly our charge! This is the music of the low places, the iniquitous places... - He's lying, Judge, he's lying! It's trouble music, that's all it is. It's trouble music. When folks has got trouble, they get it off their mind with singing. Singing the songs I hear since before I can remember. If a body's got ears, they can hear it everywhere, even here in Chicago.

Like a needle in a haystack. ♪♪ Well, I better give you your going-away presents now. - Bill... - We're not going away. - You're not? - No, of course not. It was fun playing with Browning for a few days. Yeah, but a whole year of that and we'd end up in the bug house. You're not kidding. I wish Johnny wouldn't go with Browning. Oh, Johnny can take it, he's a glutton for punishment. Here he comes with Jackson. Well, we better get going. - See ya later, fellas. - So long. - Take it easy. - Bye, Kit. - Good luck, Johnny. - Well, why don't you stay? Nah, good luck, Johnny. - Good luck, Johnny. - See ya. (man) Browning's band all aboard your buses. Keep you waiting long, honey? Well, you fellas got any plans yet? Well, the Grandioso's opening up again. They made us an offer. - How much? - Enough. You guys are chumps. Instead of coming along with me, you beat your brains out in nickel-and-dime joints. - For what? - For fun. So long, Johnny. You still think it's a lot of folderol, don't you? I still think it's not for you. What's wrong with making a lot of money? Nothing's wrong with that. But playing the same notes night after night, the same music months at a time. How long do you think you can do that? For this money, forever. You're kidding yourself, Johnny. You've turned into a mechanical toy, a monkey on a stick. You just give me a little time with Browning and you'll see some changes made. That's what you think. Good luck, Johnny. Well, what... what am I supposed to do, serenade on street corners? What are the boys doing? No, look, honey, what's the use of arguing? Why don't you come along with me, huh? A lot of the boys are taking their wives. We could be together, you and me. You and me. "Remember that this America is only you and me, past, present, future." Please stay, Johnny. And go back to the joint? Nothing doing. We've been happy so far, haven't we? We've had fun because we've done what we wanted to, played the music we liked. But... but it's not gonna be that way with Browning. Please stay, Johnny. The kinda jazz we know is dead. And you can count me out as a pallbearer. If that's the way you feel. That's the way I feel. Hey, Johnny, what's the matter with you? You're holding up the buses. Come on, come on, the photographers are out there. Good-bye, Kit. What's the matter, cutie, don't you wanna be in the picture? - Ready! - We're all set, Mr. Browning. - Wait for me! - Strike a pose, Mr. Browning. (cheering) ♪♪ ♪♪ Can't get enough of it, huh? Look, Mr. Browning, if you let me play that brass lick like this, we'll have something terrific. Later, Johnny, later. ♪♪ Please, Mr. Browning, give me a break. Let me play it my way, just once, huh? Later, Johnny, later. But when, when? ♪♪ Please, Mr. Browning, I... I can't take it anymore. - You gotta let me play it my way. - Later, Johnny, later. But I'm telling you, I can't take it anymore! You can always quit. ♪♪ ♪♪ Just another jazz band. You're slipping, Smiley. Listen, can't you hear? It's more than just jazz. It's... it's got kind of a swing. - It's new. - It's too new for me. Listen to that horn. Oh, I get it, Johnny Schumacher, huh? - Give him a break. - What for? Smiley never forgets a friend, remember? Oh, Kit, I've known you for 10 years and I still can't figure you out. You go and marry a guy, he goes off and leaves you... disappears... and what do you do? You go out and try and find him a job. Why? What's this cornet player got that I ain't got? Oh, Smiley, listen. You're a chump, you know that, don't ya? I know, but he's good, and I want you to give him a break. Oh, I must be going soft in my old age. All right, I'll send him a wire. I'll squeeze him into that band over at the 46 Club. But he's got a band of his own. He's got a band? I got 20 of 'em. Johnny's will knock 'em dead. They don't die so quick in this town. (knocking on door) All right, open up, open up. - What do you want? - House Detective. Just let me have a look around the room. - Anything wrong? - That's what we'll have to find out. I still think there's something funny going on in this room. Well, pleasant dreams. - It's cold out there. - Shh shh. Over there? Oh, it's cold out there. Ah. Okay, sonny boy, let's go. - Oh. - Let's go, come on, come on. - Around you go. - Come on. - Give me some room. - Well, you wanna be comfortable. - Give me it. - Get a hold of that. Ah, ya big... watch yourself. Give me some covers. - Shh! - Give me some covers. - Shh. - Aah... You know, Johnny, I've been thinking, we could all get jobs if we split up. What's the use of trying to stick together any longer? We split up once before when I went with Browning and got nowhere fast. Well, where we going now? Well, we recorded some numbers. Yeah, for the agents to shelf. (mumbling) What's the matter, Herbert, you got a bellyache? Shh. He's saying his prayers. - Well, pray for me, too. - Pray for yourself. If the Lord hears me, he's gonna have his hands full. (loud knocking on door) The house dick, scram! Shh shh shh shh!

Mr. Mario, manager of the Star Room, is calling, sir. Put him on, put him on. Hello, Mr. Mario. I was just thinking about you. Say, uh, how about a little more dough for Johnny Schumacher? More dough? Are you crazy? Don't you know what happened in Buffalo? Johnny. Johnny. Kit. He didn't tell me anything. No, he isn't here, but I expect him any minute. Why didn't you write? Well, the night I left, you called me a monkey in Eddie's Cafe. It made me sore. When I found out you were right, I really got mad. I ditched the band, wound up in Frisco. For a while, I thought I'd never come back... so what was the use in writing? What did make you come back? Lots of things. I saw guys who were a lot worse off than me, guys who were beat down, slapped around, coming from no place, going nowhere. Yet every night, somewhere along the road, they'd stopped and come to life. They hadn't forgotten how to laugh. They could still sing music made up by guys in a jam. Songs about broken lives and busted dreams. I was like crazy when I heard it. It made me see what brings people together. They wanna get rid of their troubles... talk 'em, sing 'em, or dance 'em away. Well, well, well, the prodigal son. Hiya, Smiley. Uh, did you tell the missus you were a flop in Buffalo? - Flop? - That's right. What happened? What went wrong? Nothing, they just couldn't dance to our music is all. What's the matter, shoes nailed to the floor? No, it was a large barn-like affair, and the people tried to waltz and... Well, you can't waltz to this music. - Why not, why not? - Well, it's just different, and it has to be danced differently. - How, on the ceiling? No, we'll show you. ♪♪ I wonder what's keeping Johnny so long. They're listening to our record. Boy, get a load of those drums. Eight more payments and they're all mine.
