In the early stage of Mingguo the political status was messy. The Government was incapable of establishing order. Powerful foreign countries tried to bully and oppress her. Warlords carved out their turf with violence. Bandits were running amok. There was also endless spying. That's how it was in Old China. Below the Ngau Tau Shan. Warlord Lin controlled his area. He hates the Japanese invasion and uses all his efforts to fight the Japanese The Japanese treat him as an eyesore. The Tiger Den down the hill has some local tyrants Tiger Hong, Leopard Hong and Phoenix Hong. They are siblings. They do all kinds of bad things and they allly with Japanese. Three devils they bully the commoners. They are well-known traitors. However more than 15 kilometers outside Tiger Den there is Lucky Star Town which is just like a fairy land. The common people live happily in here. Until... Have we been to this town? No. Why? The old man said this town is different. Maybe he suffered sunstroke. He told us not to bother the people of Lucky Star Town. This dump? He is so old that he doesn't have the guts. How can we not kill him?

Lucky Star Town.. Here Comes.. Xing 's wife, has father come back yet? Miss is back. General's been delayed for one day. He'll be back tomorrow. That's bad news. Yet, In a way it is good news. An extra day to prepare something delicious for father. Ok. Per the intel Tiger Den has formed an alliance with the Japanese. And is a covert Intelligence camp for Japanese spies. The lady spy Kurosawa Kiyoko will be arriving there in two days. We should get the name list ASAP. Or there will be trouble. We go in there to investigate just after dusk. No way.. Why don't we wait for Tony Luo and do it together. Tony Luo.. He needs two more days to arrive. I'm afraid we can't wait. We just need to be careful. Let's go. Welcome Miss Kurosawa. Please forgive us for not picking you up soon.. My main purpose of coming here this time, is to take care of Warlord Lin. That fatso is hard to take care. He has a rough temper and his kung fu is very good. I've tried many attempts but I have never found a chance. If he could be bought, buy him. If he can't, kill him. It seems that someone is looking for you. As expected, it is really the Japanese intelligence camp. I found it. The confidential list of Japanese spies. The senior had been looking for this. Janice, you keep it safe. Spy came, go and get him. Let's see if you can escape. You go first. Be careful! Go quickly! Leopard Hong? Are you afraid now? Let's go. Good. I'll distract him. Go quickly! He was hit by my poisoned ninja star. He can't go too far. Go after him! Miss, what are you thinking about? I am thinking what I should cook for dad when he is back tomorrow. General loves you so much. He would love whatever you cook for him. Dad is so poor since mom had died. No woman takes care of him. Therefore I have to take care of dad for mom. What are you doing?! What is the sound outside? Shall I go and check it out. Tiger Hong, are you Insane? You dare come to General Lin's home and make trouble? We are the best citizens. Someone had stolen our stuff and hid it In There. So tell me, what should we do? Bullshit! Why would we have a thief In here? Then let us In to take a look. You dare! General Lin's family is Inside, how dare you barge In. Why are all of you at my home? Go away, all of you! General Lin. Mr. Ishihara has given you an offer. He is still waiting for your reply. Really? His offer is enough for me to spend for two lives. So we...will become a family soon? Don't move! Let me tell you.. All my life I have had the courage to do anything I want. But I dare not be a traitor. Leave! What happened? Tony Luo.. Tony Luo, are you ok? Don't come In! This is dad! Not even you, dad. I am bathing. So why are you screaming? I slipped just now. Be careful. Ok. What was Tiger Hong's reason for coming? He said a thief had stolen his property so he came here. Bullshit. Go and check around. In case someone really broke in. Yes. Go. Come on, slowly. Lay down first. You awake? I have a dart on my back and you put me down like this.. How could I not be awaken? I'm sorry. How should I help you then? Pick the dart out for me. Stop the bleeding, - sterilize and warp it. - Sterilize and warp it. Ok. Give me some anti-inflammatory. Have you finished bathing? I've finished. Then I am coming In. Dad. What happened? Nothing. I was just worried some bad guys got in. Dad, how would someone dare To do anything offensive to us? You should take rest earlier. That's true. You've grown. Yes, I've grown. No, I mean your legs have grown. You don't come back often, so you can't even recognize me. Go out...I'm not gonna chat with you. Wait, no. Your upper body reacts. But not your feet? It does. But the reaction is a bits low. Ok. Take some good rest. Scream in case of anything. Ok. Honey, Cheryl has really grown up. There must be a man In her bed. What should I do? Since you left me. I didn't have the time to accompany her. But shall I reveal her behaviors now? Or shall I let go? If I really drag the guy out from her bed, she'll hate me for life What? Let her be? That means I should pretend that I saw nothing? Yes. I should let Cheryl be happier. Wife, you are right. I will listen to you. Wait a moment. I am going to get some medicine. What should I do? Cut.. Cut it.. Oh, cut it Needs to sterilize.. Sterilize.. Sterilize? Are you feeling better? A bit better. But you can't stay here. If my dad finds out, we're in trouble. General. Go and keep an eye on miss. Yes. Taoist, Taoist.. Taoist. Take a seat first. Why did you bring this person?! Everyone in town comes to you when It concerns births, deaths, aging and illnesses. Please save him. Let me take a look. Taoist, please save him. The living and dead I can treat. But he is right between them. Why are you here? So who should I look for? Just hand him over to us. Hand him to you? Hand him over to us. What are you worried about? As long as he is a man, we can cure him. What happened? What's up? He is dying. Please save him. Who is he? Don't worry about it. If he dies I won't talk to you forever He is hurt so badly. Only Madonna could cure him. Can she? She has a super reviving pill which cures all diseases: Internal Injury, kidney disease, pimples, constipation, disorder, syphilis, athlete foot. As long as he isn't dead, it can be cured. So let's go now. That's not that easy. That pill is her wedding gift. She may not even give it to her dad if he was dying. I can buy it from her. If I was injured like this.. How much would you pay? 100 big dollars. How about him? Any cost. You can't buy it with money. What should we do then? There is only one person who can help you. Who? This is so dangerous why are you doing this? It's a long story. I was having lunch... Just go. Got it. Grab on tighter. Got it. On her chest is the reviving pill. Lower. A bit more. The rope ends here. No more.. Big Trumpet, come down.. Big Trumpet.. Come down.. Smart. Go down and get it. Hurry. Go down quickly. Go down immediately. Listen to me. I said go down and get it, asshole. Or I'll beat you! Spider.. Expert of all clans and you're afraid of a spider? Don't fool around. Go get it quickly. This way. Stop fooling around. I don't feed you for nothing! Spider.. Expert of all clans and you're afraid of a spider? Harder, buddy! Why am I so popular? Because we are too cool. You bastard! What are you doing here? Trying to kill me?! I.. I love you! I should have noticed. No wonder you come see Mademoiselle Hong all the time. While you keep your eyes on me. Yes. Right. I feel strange, too. I am hotter than Mademoiselle Hong. There is no reason for you to go after her rather than me. I thought you were insane. Or blind. Yes, I know it's my fault. I know I'm wrong. I can't confront you anymore. I am leaving now. No way. Both you and I will be very sad if that is so. So what should we do? How about from now on.. We have an affair. During daytime, you go dating with Mademoiselle Hong. At night.. Good idea. Are you happy? Happy. Are you excited? Excited. Such an impartible opponent. Just a kiss! Sister, how come it is so noisy? What? Little Trumpet. Why are you here? You are such an unlucky guy! After my sister.. After my sister.. Don't beat him, don't beat him.. Sister. Go to hell! Sister.. You've beaten Little Trumpet to death. Give me back my Little Trumpet. I don't want to live any more. From now on, I won't allow you two to meet at night. He has to come to my place at night. I mean if he comes to my place I will beat him to death! I've got it. Sweetheart! Hey...are you ok? Ok? You may try your self. Hey, how about the pill? It's already very fortunate that I'm still alive, buddy. That means the lounge lizard would die? Sweetheart! Hey, hey.. What's the matter with him? His circulation was disconnected because of the shock. He'll definitely die. Look at him. No worries. I have a surviving pill. It can revive him. Bring it back and take it. No way. He needs to take it now. He should be fine after taking it. I'm fine now. - That soon? - Yes. Let's go play soccer. - Great. - Soccer? Good night. Soccer at this time of the night? He...how come he is still sick? Ok, don't worry and go home. I will return a living man to you tomorrow. Thank you, then. Actually the reviving pill can only keep him alive. If we want to save him.. We need to transfer our energy to push the poison out from him. Ok, we should finish it off. Let the five of us do it together. Transfer the energy to him and push the poison out. - OK. - Come on. Why all of you go behind him? We all small potato. You are the best among us. Of course you do it first. Alright! Fine! It's already 1 hour and he still not up? I am not feeling quite well these days. Can't concentrate at all. How about finding a replacement? Chanting Bing and Little Trumpet, come and replace me. You are a trouble maker. - I already really hurt! - That's for you. It's already two hours, did you guys do your best? I should use my left hand. I am right handed. Let me do it. How about me. - You come here then. - Alright. Let me do it. You bastard. What's going on? Concentrate! Mannie, actually I like you a lot. But I am a very shy person. I don't know how to confess my love to you. I am old and I don't have much money. I could only treat you nicely from my heart. I don't mind that you are the lady boss of a brothel. I hope you also don't mind that I am old. After you finish reading this letter. If you don't like it just throw it away. If you like it, you may show me some signs. Always love you, Chanting Bing. Do they know that I am writing a letter to Miss Manuelle? Chanting Bing, I have something to tell you. Acting strangely. Why are you crying?! I noticed how Cheryl looked at Tony Luo.. I know I don't have any hope. When you like a girl, do you want her to be happy or do you want yourself to be happy? Her. You saved the handsome guy. Cheryl must be very happy. Really. But what about me? Stop crying, would you?! Cry...you make me wanna cry, too. I need to face Mademoiselle Hong and Madonna. I don't know what to do. I wanna ask the world "What love is?". Miss. You haven't returned home all night. Where were you? We all are so worried. Where is dad? He is meeting a guest in the study room. Dad. - How come you didn't... - This is? She is my daughter. She's called Cheryl. You are as pretty as your mother. And this is? I am the daughter of Nie Town mayor. There are a lot of bandits. I specially come here To ask your dad to assist us. You go to the kitchen first. I will come and cook with you later. Ok. You have a good relationship with your daughter. Little Trumpet said, Cheryl will be happy if I save that guy. If Cheryl is happy, I am happy. But why am I so sad now? Losing someone whom I love is so painful. Do you think you are the only one suffering? You are the only one that lost your love? What do you know? Have you ever been In love? I've lost my love so many times I can tell. When I was young. There were endless beauties who were into me. They also gave me a nickname, Handsome Tsoi. How can they tell such a lie? Then I retired from the Jianghu and came here. I found the love of my life. Who? Tell me. It is.. It's my Mannie. Miss Manuelle? But I am poor. I'm not good enough for her. Have you confessed your love to her? I'm so afraid that She will turn me down once again. No courage at all. How about you? Why don't you go to tell Cheryl That you love her? I'm so afraid that she'll turn me down on the site. Both of us have lost our love. Losing someone is love is so painful You better kill me. You kill me first and than I'll kill you. If I've killed you, how could you kill me? Let's think of away to die together. Good. Let's go to your home for a meeting. Good. Tony Luo.. Handsome. It's dark already. We have nice wine and nice cuisine, We also have pretties to visit your room Are you coming up? No thanks. But I want to get some Information. Did four men walk pass here 3 days ago? We don't know. But we can ask for you. Mannie...There is a man down asking about the 4 men who were going to Tiger Den 3 days ago. Could they be his friend? Be careful. If they are people from Tiger Den, they would pretend that they are his friend. But he is so handsome. He doesn't look like a bad guy. Have you had enough that men keep taking advantage of you. Where does this handsome come from? I just want to look for 4 friends of mine. I haven't seen 4 friends. But we have 4 pretties here. I would suggest you stay here and get the information. Maybe you'll get some Information. Don't worry. I will seek for the information myself. Let's go. I'll use this one. This one it is. To pierce through your lung. I'll use this one to pierce through your bladder. I'll use this one to cut your aorta. I'll use this one to cut your Intestines. We'll die for sure. - Yes, we must be able to die. - Able to die. Step back. Even the ants manage to survive. Why are the two of you committing suicide? It's none of your business. Did we say we are committing suicide?! No. That's it. But your bodies are equipped with.. Can we just play Sharp weapons.. Have you ever had Western?! - Are you from the rural areas? - Have you tried steak before? Move! Are you here to help out again? Yes. But you need to pay me. What is this kid doing here? He was peeping when we were in the shower. Don't misunderstand me, seniors. I am just looking for my friends who are missing. If I made you mad. Please accept my apology. Young guy. Lucky Star Town won't be bullied. Yet they don't bully others. Just go. See you later. Manysons, why did you let him go? I haven't fought enough yet. Did he really peep when you were showing? - Yes! - Yes! Why were the two of you having a shower together? We save water Save water.. Disgusting. Miss Manuelle...you've misunderstood.. Miss Manuelle! Why can't we die? Xing's wife. How come dad hasn't come down for meal? Just wait for some awhile. He is chatting with Miss Nie upstairs. That much food that I've made. Do I have to eat by myself? I can't drink anymore. That soon? General, you are good at drinking. What is this? Shall we dance? I don't know how to dance. Let me teach you. Give me your hand. You.. This is injection anesthetizes your nerves. The effects will be apparent very soon. It's useless even you've picked it out. You'll listen to me very soon. General! Team Leader Zhu, you want to revolt? You are right. Team Leader Zhu is on my side long time ago. Dad! Push the cabinet away. Dad. Go quickly! Give way! Xing's wife. Go after her! Yes, Miss Kurosawa Kiyoko. Those people In the Lucky Star Town are all KungFu experts. How come all of them take things lightly? As they have good kungfu. How come they are willing to stay In a small town like this? Are they lackeys of the Japanese? Be careful! - Let me go... - Don't move! Miss. Miss... Are you ok? Thank you. What is your name? My name is Tony Luo. Your name is Tony Luo? I know Tony Luo. Have you met them? He was hurt. I've sent him to Luck Star Town to be healed. Lucky Star Town. You would know if we go to Lucky Star Town and check it out. Ok. Honey.. You said you were going to date me. I couldn't find you all over the town. Honey.. Shit, I can't continue on like this. Mademoiselle Hong. We've already closed. Mademoiselle Hong. You.. It's me. Turn around. Little Tailor, my cousin is here to visit me. Go! Why are you dressed like this? Your sister has been looking for me. Saying we.. I don't care. I have to tell my sister. I have to marry you. What is it? Why it so hard? A bowl. Sister. What do we do? - Hide here. - This way. Quick. Hide In the jar. Don't throw away your shoes. I'm so angry. That bastard.. Sister. Why are you still up at this time of the night? What are you doing? I...am playing hide and seek. With who? Little Trumpet. Little Trumpet?! Is he here? - No. - Where is he?! Little Trumpet! Sister...I'm not sure where he is. Has he gone out already? Don't worry about him. Why? Why don't you let me die when I want to? Little Trumpet, you may come out. You may come out, Little Trumpet. Mademoiselle Hong? Mademoiselle Hong? What's up? As I treat you as sister. I have a secret to tell you. You have to keep this secret for me. I am good at keeping secrets. Bing peeped on you showering and Manuelle stole abalone. Little Tailor said your figure is poor. Did I tell you all this? You're good at keeping secrets. That, of course. Actually, although I am so grown up but I haven't.. been kissed. I want you to teach me. Now? Buddy! I have never thought of trying it with you. So what do you really want? To tell the truth, I am In love with Little Trumpet. Good night. Hey, give me back my money! So what is it? I don't want Little Trumpet to know that I don't have this kind of experience. Teach me. Obviously you don't read books. The Dream of the Red Chamber Is the best guide. Don't move if it's immoral, don't look if it's immoral, don't say if it's immoral. I don't get it. Move your lips here. Let me teach you. Wow, you are taking advantage then? You'll take my first kiss. No way! So do you have paper? We can put a piece of paper In between so it doesn't count. Do you have paper? Yes. Don't move if it's immoral means when he wants to kiss you.. You pout and stop moving, Don't look if it's immoral means.. You close your eyes and enjoy the process Don't say when it's immoral.. doesn't mean not to speak. It means you speak while you pout. The happiest moment is to write with him. Not with your hand but with your tongue. You write to him and he writes to you. Like that? You can write like that. Are you human? I love you so much. Mademoiselle Hong. Mademoiselle Hong. Ho... To be a bad guy? Mademoiselle Hong, I'm hungry. Auntie, what are you doing here? It's me, Little Trumpet. Little Trumpet?! Keep quiet! Look at this. [I want to be a bad guy. She is dead.] Something big is happening! What?! And.. I removed her first piece of clothing In here?! Go! And then.. She has no clothes left on any more?! She has nothing left on! She has put her clothes back on? So.. And then.. Mademoiselle Hong.. Is everything ok? If so, get up. It's fine. Let's go home. Let's go home What had happened? I'll organize a wedding banquet for you two tomorrow. Grown up men and women should get married. You just need to complete the registration. Sister, why are you acting so strangely? Nothing. She had promised our marriage. Really? We should be happy as she promised our marriage. Why are you so Intense? I'm very excited. You two.. Little Tailor.. This alley.. I.. Good bye poor guy that can't get a girl. Wait! Glad that I could stop. But I couldn't. Me neither! Sister, are you ok? My butt hurts! Are you ok? Sister! Why don't you let me die? You shouldn't die like this. Yes, you are such an idiot. Little Tailor, why are you hanging there? To grow taller. Don't you think I've become taller? You bastard! Why are you back after you have peeped us showering? Senior, no more joke, please. I am Tony Luo. I just want to look for my lost friends. I mean no harm. You can rest as sure of that.

You've hugged the wrong person. She is here. What did I do wrong? Tony. Howard Luo and them... they... sacrificed themselves. However, we've looted a list of Japanese spies. The Tiger Den became traitors. Even Warlord Lin is In the Japanese's hand. How do you know? The Japanese Ninjas were after Cheryl. Fortunately she ran into me. But why did she cry and leave the moment she saw us? She likes you. She likes me? She thought you were a man. Miss Cheryl. I actually thought she is a man. Am I as stupid as a pig. Do you want to hear the truth? Not now. Actually you are the smartest girl I've ever met. It doesn't matter if I am a man or a woman. You should worry about your dad's safety first. You are right. Dad was grabbed by that evil woman. We gotta save him. It hurts...my shoulder.. - It really hurts...Help - Are you feeling better? Gently! - All seniors. - It really hurts! You all have good kungfu. If we could work together, we need not be afraid of them. It's not that we don't want to help you. The problem is that everyone of us had our own sorrow history. We want to have a peaceful life now.
