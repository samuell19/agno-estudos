We use the element of surprise. It's a private event, so most people will be in the hall. Exceptions are to be dealt with by Karlos, guarding the corridor. Arny and Mosquito get the backstage. David has the front entrance to the hall. I get the side. Operation Pitbull starts at 2210 sharp. Nobody will ever get here! No darkies, never! White power! White power! -Sieg. -Heil! You prick! Take the guitarist down. He sucks. -Karlos, sector C. -Clear. Mosquito, sector A. -Mosquito, sector A. -Sector’s clear! Hello there, nihilists. -Dave, sector D. -D is clear. Arny, sector B. I'm ready. They'll never forget this show. I'm counting. This is the police, get down! Police of the Czech Republic. Police of the Czech Republic, get down, keep your heads down! Turn the lights on! -I've got only one joint here, tops! -I don't give a shit. Get down! On the floor, heads down. Where are the records? Remain calm and stay where you are! There are dangerous, armed persons within the building. I repeat, remain calm. We'll ensure your safety. Pregnant women and the elderly will be the first to leave the room. Pregnant women and the elderly can now start leaving the room slowly. with their arms above their head. Slowly. -What a massacre, man. -In and out, nice job, man. In and out. That's the way I like it. That's the way to do it. Absolute precision. Pregnant women and the elderly can start leaving the room slowly, oh man! And that hag, not even fifty, she said: ‘I’m elderly!’ No, she was shouting: ‘I'm pregnant, I'm pregnant!’ ‘I'm a pregnant elderly person.’ The sound guy was pathetic as well. ‘That's just for me, just for personal consumption.’ Faggot! -He had a pocketful of that shit. -Weed for the whole city. -Gentlemen, that was really great. Thank you, all of you. -Yeah. Good job, gentlemen. And especially precise. To the millimetre! To the left, a bit more to the left. Great, that’s it. So how's it going? Fine, we're almost done. I want to see everything, guys, an impregnable fortress. Sure. Why didn't he get us the deal for the municipality? Who cares? Just this pathetic job. What's this thing? Look, Josef Váňa's whip? And over here, Ozzy Osbourne's mic? That's cool. And what's this? He's got Putin's trousers including the belt here! Don't touch it. It's soaked in tetrachloride. Novichok. -You're kidding, aren't you? -How do you know? -Here are the things. -Let's wrap it up. -Done? -Done. What do you think, Dad? -It’s perfect. -Thanks. -Can I help you? -That'd be great. Karel, you've got a call. -Who's calling? -Avalon. What's up? Yeah? "I TRAIN, THEREFORE I AM." Okay, let's do it. Let's go for it. How is it going? Fine. Radek, move off a bit. You're looking down her kitchen. Arny, you're just envious you can't touch this perfect gluteus. You should do the couching course as well then. And you'd better do a course in good manners. I'll pay for it. Go on, go on. -Kamil, come and help me! -I can't, I need to do something. What? Steal something and do a runner? While you don't even run any longer. I'm not going to help you out of prison again! "BOAT RENTAL RECEPTION - ACCOMMODATION" What are you going to do with the marmalade? The bible, the book of books. No matter where you open it, you always find the answer to your question. -Yeah? -Always. I'll fuck you like a piglet, baby. Hello? Is anyone in there? Hello? Shit! -Come back soon. -Okay. How many monsterboosters have you done? You're overdoing it, man. You're sitting the wrong way. Ease off, man, I don't want to see it in here. You know what they call you? Fucking Marty Feldman. Your face is like traffic lights. Go on, go on then. I train, therefore I am. -Good morning. -Where have you been? We've been waiting for 20 minutes. We want to rent a canoe. -150 years. -Mussels. Only 2 per cent live that long. Industrial revolution, chemicals, sewage, canoeists. Everything's dead, even the mussels. You people are horrible. The brakes are fine, the gears too. You can try it out. -Really? -Sure. -Well, thanks then. -She's nicked it, man! -She'll come back, no worries. -She'll come back, my arse! -She’ll be back. -It's the third bike this month. -They'll turn up somewhere. You know what? You'll pay for them, Mosquito. What is all this hate for, Nomad? Listen to yourself, are you nuts? -Nuts? -Totally negative. I slave my arse off, you always fuck things up and now you're the wise guy? I gotta go. See you tomorrow, Nomad. You know what, go and fuck yourself. I’m done with you. Tomorrow, my arse! It was okay, but not to the millimetre. -You said it was perfect. -Yes, but not to the millimetre. So guys... -Karel, we need to talk... -The moment of truth. -Not now, I don’t have time. -What do you mean you don't have time? Karlos. When in action, you could at least get the rod ready. You wag a machine which wouldn't even fart. Oh man, I didn't notice. -Dave, I saw it well. -What? You escort the evacuated like a horny Mongolian. Really? I didn't notice. Yes, there’s no eye contact. You keep staring at girls' tits. -Shut the fuck up. -Keep doing it, but only in that rental place of yours. You can shag there as much as you like. Mosquito, does your mum close the door after you? I don't have a mum. When you are the last to leave the emergency vehicle, don't you think you should shut the door? I didn't shut it? What would we do if we got back and the vehicle was gone? I didn't realise that. Sorry to everyone. -What about me? -Arny, no objections, good job. Thanks. Karlos, you got a bit lost there, didn't you? When? What? No. You mean out there! Yeah, well. But I was on alert. Be more careful next time. But otherwise, it was okay, lads. So, here’s to the RRU. We could evacuate the cinema, couldn’t we? Bollocks, we'll evacuate the whole town. You mean our town? That sounds great, mate. Fucking hell, commander! We'll evacuate this town, because it's ours and it's our duty. Follow me. We'll clean this beautiful town where pearl mussels are born. Because this town faces an attack. -Where from? -From the sea. -Sure. -You keep taking the piss. I'm not taking the piss. Against the stream. Against the stream, there are thousands of eels swimming this way. What do you mean eels... What eels? Special ones, trained eels. Hamas, Nasra, IS, Al-Qaeda... They've got special watertight bombs round their tails. -Eel terrorists, fucking hell! -Eels with bombs. Round their tails! Loaded eels! And when they reach the town, they blow themselves up. I'd cook for all of you, home-made food, not just some TV dinners, pre-fried shit. Everything; rabbits, all fresh. It's their home here. They come here to spawn, to reproduce. -Then they go back to the Red Sea. -Sargasso Sea. The whole town can blow up, but eels are fucking peaceful fish. They can't do this to them, it’s not fair! We work in pairs. Arny, Karlos - the Gold Unit. Dave, Mosquito - Silver Unit. Task number one. Clearing the space in front the building. No delays. Details later. At 23:40 task number two. Entering the premises and preparing the operation centre for copter landing. Is that clear? The premises are 500 metres north-west of the town. Operation Heliport starts at 23:30. Mosquito, one gun isn't functional, so sort it out with your old man. We'll get it ready. The owner of the premises is a local poacher. No one has caught him yet, so he’s an ideal target for us. Don't forget anything. It's an hour's journey so we don't want to go back. -Jarda? -What is it? -Someone's coming. -Damn. -Go and have a look then. -Shit! Fucking hell! Police of the Czech Republic. Jaromír Lánský? Oh fuck. Good evening, this is the police. Rapid reaction unit. Mr. Lánský, we need your help. Your location is extremely strategic. Guys, don’t be crazy. It's just gossip, I've never shot a single deer. Who is it? Mrs. Lánská, Mr. Lánský, for public safety reasons a helicopter will land here at 24:00. Jesus Christ! We have ten minutes left. Jesus Christ! I hope it's not because of the couple of deer. It's not, Mr. Lánský. My men are clearing the space. The bench, fireplace, flowerbeds, tomatoes, it all needs to go. What do you mean by "go"? Commander, the heliport is ready. -What about the greenhouse? -That can stay. Please, tell us what's going on. I'm sorry, Mrs. Lánská, the operation is run by the Ministry of Interior. It’s strictly confidential. Don't get involved, Zdena. There are people in the village who poach on a large scale. And I could name them. You'll have to provide a room for us. -What room? -Jesus Christ! Around 15 square metres, it needs to be emptied. -How about the bedroom? -Jarda, don't be stupid... You want to give them the living room? No, but how about the chicken coop? -It's too small! -No, it's at least 15 metres. The most suitable room strategically is the living room. -Dave. -Yes, sir? Locate the operation centre. Start with the living room. -Yes, sir. -Karlos, you go with him. For god's sake, what are we going to do? You are going to navigate the helicopter for landing, Mrs. Lanska. Stand here. You'll get a torch. -Give Mrs. Lánská a torch. Turn it on. -Yes, sir. You'll hold it above your head and make figure eights, okay? -Yes. -Let's try it. Larger ones. Great. That's it. -Like this? -More, more, that's it. So that the helicopter knows where to land. That's it, Mrs. Lánská. We are here, here! Yes, here. She might still be waving that torch around! Gentlemen, this was an op from the bottom of the heart. I love this! It was fantastic, really great! It was the fucking best this year! -The heliport was brilliant... -RRU go-go-go-go-go! Robert, thanks, mate. It was perfectly prepared. Fucking ingenious strategy. Operation to the millimetre, commander. Perfect. -What about that cunt, Arny? -What do you mean? The cunt shape, what was that? Was the helicopter to land on a cunt? The order was to trace a rectangle! A rectangle! It will be gone in a minute. It's just a kind of foam. It’ll be gone by morning. -But otherwise fine, don’t you think? -Great! I'd die if we didn't do RRU, I'd fucking die. Exactly. All those our operations. It wasn't a life before, man. What kind of a life was that? Like an ant, a slave. Just slaving away. This is a part of you now, it’s a mission. You mean a calling. Exactly, trust, friendship, discipline, mutual trust... -Respect. Discipline. -Precisely. -Gentlemen... -Yes! A petrol station, pull over here. I need a drink. -But we are still RRU. -Yeah. Stop fucking around! What the fuck is taking you so long? Damn, I'm pregnant, can’t you see? -How much is in there? -I don't know! -Seventy or eighty thousand! -Move it! If they don't have a hazelnut cappuccino, I'll never fill my tank here again. Lads, full gear, the operation continues. -Sure, Rob, let's go. -No beer there! No beer, soda only, I've got my eyes on you. Three mins max. Give me the cash now, for fuck's sake, or I’ll shoot you! -Don't stir an inch! -Okay! Put the gun away, put it down! -Put the gun down! -You stupid bitch! Don't move or I'll shoot her. Put it down, you prick! Calm down! -I’ll shoot myself... -On the ground, now! -Fucking hell, what a dickhead! -Let's get lost. -What the fuck was that? -Hurry up! What the hell was that? What the fuck? Robert's not here! Where the fuck is he? -Where is the fucking key? -It’s in the ignition. -Come on, come on. -Go, go. No fucking RRU, no petrol station in Dehtov, are we clear? It's a total fuck-up! There was no RRU in Dehtov, it doesn't exist, we didn’t go anywhere. -Why don't you heat it first? -It works fine like this. Why don't you turn the heating on? Tell me what kind of a person you are! Tell me! -What is it, Dad? -"What is it, Dad"? Go, go away. -Help me lift it. -Okay. Watch out. You think it's going to work? Of course not. But it's important to measure the rope. Strawberry. Don't overload yourself. You'll tear your tit and you're done! What are you going to do without a tit? I think I'm gonna give you a beating soon. Why? Because I'm so witty? -I understand that. -Like a baby. Here's the birthday guy. -Rob! -Hi. Commander. -Hi there, Rob. -Hi, Mosquito. Commander. Move off. One from the source. So, is the RRU back then? Are you fucking kidding me? I said no meetings, no Armageddon and now even the anthem? Go and fuck yourselves! This is an exception. Commander's birthday is everyone's birthday. I said no exceptions. Without the anthem, but to your health. To all the seized gigs and pregnant elderly ladies. And now something fucking serious. I don't want to hear the words Dehtov and RRU in here. Otherwise I quit. I'm done. Are we clear? Okay. -Here’s to you. -To the commander. I’m amazed how quickly you shook it all off. Really. -Like nothing happened here. -Okay, guys... Like Rob has just said, no... And no.... Lying low. Low. -Have you got a fag? -Sure, here you are. Don't tell me you don't miss it. That you wouldn't do it again. -Pitbull, Bridegroom, Heliport. -Mosquito, come on! I know a perfect target, an old paper mill. They cook meth there. Stop it, for fuck’ sake, Mosquito! Are we going to get all soft like some old cunts? We've all agreed. All of us. We said it was over. So it’s over. Fucking over. Because of some nutter at a fucking petrol station we are going to fuck up our friendship or what? Are we going to pretend we don't know each other because of that fucking Dehtov? -Sorry. -That's how it is. Sure, fine, but on the other hand, the RRU. But then again, I don't really need to remind myself of Dehtov. But you will have to. That's what it's all about. A dead guy. A nutter. With a hole in his brains. Stench like from a marten's arse. You can't air that. -I can guarantee that, you can't air that. -No. You can't air that, that’s right. I knew I shouldn't have come. It’s over, we said it was over, definitely over, erased. Dehtov petrol station doesn't exist. Okay, it doesn't exist. -Fuck! -Fine, it doesn't exist. We just wanted something to drink at the petrol station. You wanted something to drink. But going in there in full gear that wasn't Mosquito's idea. And whose then? Mine? Jesus, Robert, it's not your fault. It's no one's fault, it was just bad luck. Hard luck, that’s all. It was destiny, wasn't it? -Karma. -Yeah. Okay, thanks for a fantastic birthday party. Special thanks to Mosquito, it was his idea. I hope we won't meet again for a very long time. Robert, commander. -Why didn't you tell us you gave her money? -Who? You gave her money to shut her up. Go and fuck yourselves! All of you! What money? What was that? Shit. Are you okay? -Why are you ringing at people? -I'm just ringing. -Something could have happened. -Are you okay? Why wouldn't I be? What's up? Is it normal to ring like this? Why is your eye twitching? Something could have happened to me. -Your eyes are twitching. -They aren't. -Would you fancy some coffee? -Coffee? -Yeah, coffee. -Yeah, coffee's okay. So... Let's go then. Are you really okay? Just my knee a bit, but it's nothing. I've moved here from Domažlice, I’m not local. It's just that I don't know you. We all know each other here. -Mája. -Mosquito. -And you’re alright? -What? I mean whether you're healthy. Sure you are. And the baby's fine too? Are you interrogating me? How do you know I have a baby? No, I just, the Dehtov petrol station. Have we met before? You haven't recognized me. During the hold-up. Who are you? Five guys, balaclavas, all the gear, the police... Is this a test or what? Okay, no balaclavas, no gear, no police. -Come on. -Do you want the money back? -What money? -I knew it won't be that easy. I didn't tell anyone anything, so the money is mine. I don't want any money. -Come on, come on. -Fuck... -Move on... I'm from the Rapid Reaction Unit. I'm glad you're fine, but we need your confidentiality. It was a secret mission of our elite unit, no one can find out about us. Not even the criminal police, there's a law for that. You'll get ten thousand now and the rest, 40 thousand on your account. Your account number. Pen and paper, quick. Tell me what happened. He came in, wanted cash, aimed, and shot himself. Is that clear? -What about the CCTV? -What am I to do with him? -He'd disconnected it. -Call the ambulance, and 158. He'd disconnected the CCTV? Fine. Lifelong confidentiality. 50 grand is not peanuts. Don't slam it down. Come here. And off to bed. Really, fifty grand is a lot and he didn't say a word. Has he ever said anything? He’d plan everything alone. "Come to this or that place and you'll find out." Plus his pride. He must have got the money from somewhere, it’s a lot. And they say he's completely skint. If he had said something at least. I’ve been scared shitless for nothing. -Kája. -Yeah? Ivana. -Fucking hell, throw it for me. -Come on, Karlos. Put it on pause, I need to make a call anyway. To Blanka, she needs to stir the marmelade. -With your left. -What? -Use your left hand. -Yeah. -Arny, he's survived. -Who what? The manager from Dehtov told me when he came to see me. He survived. It must be a joke, I thought. Then it kept haunting me again and again and then I said ‘stop’. So I called my ex. He's a bit of an idiot, but quite a big boss. He's got contacts and info. Well, a guy who almost blew your head off is worth it, isn’t he? -Hello. -Can you tell me where Mr. Babor is? -On the terrace over there. -Thanks. -Mr. Babor? -Yeah. -I'm Mája, do you remember me? -No. Dehtov petrol station. I just wanted to see what you look like... without the mask. Go to hell. I was behind the desk, you wanted money... Get lost. He doesn’t look great, but he's alive. That's not even possible, a bullet in his skull, blood everywhere. On the internet they said he was dead. He obviously isn't. If you're making this up, fuck off! Really! I'm not making it up. Really. -Who the hell is this guy? -He said that, Babor. -Babor. Immortal Babor. He shoots half of his head off and then lives on. Fuck me! Can you believe it? I don't know, maybe he's Russian. What's up, who? Tell him. Go on. -He survived. -Who? -That arsehole from the petrol station. -He survived. -You're fucking kidding me, right? -I don't think so. But it's okay, he doesn't remember a thing. I wanted to tell you before, but you kept saying, "No RRU" and "Dehtov doesn't exist", no operations. I’m sorry. Is he functional then? They say his top half is, the bottom half said farewell. But anyway, it’s a miracle of nature. Yeah, but even better, isn't it? Much better. Things happen. I saw a TV documentary the other day. There's a hill in the Philippines with reversed gravitation. You put a plastic bottle down and it shoots up. So cool. I like it, I feel relieved now I know he's survived. It's good, isn't it? There's someone else who should know this. That's for sure. That's clear. Robert, come down. Mosquito, go up. I don't want to die. Robert, come down, don't pretend you can't hear. I can't listen to this crap. Shit! Kamil, I've made goose blood soup. -I'll have some later. -You've always loved it. I don't have time now, I need to rush. Good that your mum didn't live to see this. So go, I'll eat it all myself. A crap day. First my mum, a gallbladder attack, probably, she was in terrible pain. Lotka couldn't sleep all day and then also her father. Is he not interested in her? Well, he is in fact, but that doesn't matter. What else did you get up to? For example the Bridegroom. We evacuated a whole wedding party from a restaurant. I mean completely. "This is the police, there are dangerous individuals in the vicinity of the building. Immediately evacuate the premises." Then we locked ourselves in and all the meat, cakes and spirits were ours. -We could do that together. -Together? Yeah. Do you not want to do it with me? -You think it's not for women? -No, but I mean just the two of us? -Yeah, the two of us. -Well, that's it. An RRU operation in two people can't work. And I'm now interested in big things. Evacuating a cinema in the centre. Everything's planned to the millimetre. Prepared it a month in advance. Logistics, communication, maps, all the gear. You need a kevlar helmet, goggles, a ballistic vest, a tactical vest, stun grenades, a black boilersuit, handcuffs, radio transmitters and I don't mean the stuff you buy in a toy shop. You need a closed channel, so it’s terribly pricey. And then the weapons: heck, heckl... whatever. Or at least a 58, then a Beretta, or at least a CZ 75 pistol. You can't walk in anywhere like a scout with an airgun. You need a heavy duty rod. -Where have you been so long? -Excuse me? How long? I've been living. -Are you going to kick me out again? -Sit down. You haven't got a weapon here, have you? A knife, a tin opener, that's all I've got here. It's hot out there, isn't it? Like in the tropics. Sometimes I take the lift down to the garden when there aren't many people there. They stare at me as if I was a fairground attraction. Circus Babor. -Have I startled you? -Not at all. I'm Babor. I know, Mr. Babor, I'm Mája. You're the only person who can tell me what happened. I can't remember a thing. Although you never forget the worst scam anyway. Such an injustice. They say you were pregnant. -Did the baby come out okay? -Sure, she's okay. That's great. Come here. Can you forgive me, Mája? Please. I want you to go there with me next time. -Where? -To see him. Why? He knows about you now. What? You told him the same thing you told the cops, didn’t you? He went in, he wanted cash, he got it and shot himself. Well, I did tell him that at first. -The official version. -The official version for 50 grand. -But then I went there again. -What do you mean? I just went there again. He wanted to know why he had done it, why he had shot himself, why he hadn't taken the money and run away. Why and why... He said he couldn’t remember anything. So I told him. Listen, it's not my fault. -He would like to meet you. -I'm not going to see him. No, I don't get it. You’ve got to explain it to me. You take this, throw it, they fall, and you get another throw. Cool, Karlos! Who made this for you? -I made it myself. -Rubbish. -It's the only one in the world. -Really? -Is it waterproof? -Sure. Give it here. Damn it! Blimey, this is the moan of a royal mussel. -Is that Ivana? -Besides others. Don't be nosy. A skittle that comes by itself. You're a fighter! To Armageddon, lads! -To the biggest fighter! -Karlos! -Thanks. Hey, Mosquito, one more thing. I still don't get why she had been there to see him again. I understand she wanted to find out, she was curious. See him once, and that’s enough. Why did she go there again? What I don't get is this: He walks in there at the petrol station like a great gangster, He’s got money from robberies, and ends up in a wheelchair in an asylum. -A crook from an asylum, man. -It's clear as hell. When they could milk him, they did: his family, women and when his ride was over, they kicked him in the arse. They just screwed him. -Karlos, it's not adding up. -Bollocks, it's just slow. -It's fucked. -It isn't. It's frozen. Not any longer. You did well you didn't go there. Sure, I'd never go there on my own. We should forget about him. Especially now when he's alive again. I think we should all go there. -Fucking hell! -Are you nuts? -No. -Hold on, what do you mean? -Just what I’m saying. You mean chocolates, flowers, apricots, oranges. -Karlos will bake a cake? -Yes. -That we'll go there for a chat? Like "Hi, what were you thinking when you blew your head off?" Why would we do that? Tell me why, man, why?! I've been shaking like an old washing machine that it's going to get out, that the cops will get me because of one fucker who whistles and I... you know. Do you know why Robert gave money to that girl? I'll tell you why. So that it gets wiped off for good! So that it doesn't stink here. Pack it in, stop it! He almost zapped the girl there, he almost plugged us as well, and we'll go and thank him that he only shot himself? -That's bollocks. -He's a ruin. She says he started crying. Really? -I'm not impressed by the crook. -Yeah, fuck him. But if it's his wish? Maybe he wants to apologise. -Apologise, my arse! -Sure. You know what, mate, not even over my dead body! Alright, man. Hello. Hi. Morning. You've got new wheels, it looks better. -Sit down. -It's okay, we can stand. Make them sit, my neck would hurt. Well? Can you take your glasses off? They all look like they’re blind. It took less than two years. First he fattened me up, then he slit my throat like a pig. I had three drivers, four lorries. I drove too, a small haulage firm. Then we got an offer from Musil. He’d win all public contracts. He offered me a job you don't refuse. Four months’ work, full workload. I bought seven lorries and hired guys, everything on credit. But we were always working, there wasn't any problem. Everything was great. It had never been better. What do you think I should do? I've got enough on my plate The public contracts didn't work out. I need to pay the guys, the mortgage, wife, child maintenance. You'll have to look for something then. I've got enough of my own trouble. Something is rattling inside me. You've only got one heart. This is so disgusting. Then he offered to buy a share of my firm. You don't think twice about it. You're just happy you don't have your face in the dirt. So I sold 45 % to him. I was actually quite relieved. And for two months it was all great again. Perfect. And then I was screwed again. It was over. No work. Everyone just wanted money. He left me to deal with it for a month. I was totally fucked. On drugs. Lexaurin, rohypnol, coffee - that was my daily menu. Don't worry, Míra, I'll help you out, I won't leave you to those fucking bankers. I'm also angry the money is not flowing. Bad times. Everyone around bribes, cheats, rakes in subsidies, but me? If ever I tried something like this, do you know what would happen? What's your plan then? I'll help you out. I'll give you a fair offer. You're an old friend. A million and a half for your share. Well, that's fuck all! What do you think, man? That I shit money? Everyone comes to me asking for money. I sponsor local footballers, firefighters, camps for kids. Every fucking crap is funded by me. And nobody ever thinks of swapping places with me. Don't worry though. I won't leave you in that shit. You're a piece of shit yourself. I couldn’t get out of it. Depression. Despair. Terrible dreams. I needed to cover two months to survive. That's why I went to that petrol station. He owns it anyway. Just two months to get back on my feet. But then I came across some twats with pistols. Hey! But you're going to help me. You owe me it. We owe you, my arse! I don't give a shit what you think, whether you owe me or not. I'll just rat on you. Bugger off now and think about it. We could help him. Show some compassion. Compassion? You're a moron, he's got a knife to our throats. It hit the post, it's not a goal, like little boys! I'm not some fucking Long Lost Family. It's regular blackmail! "You either do what I say or I'll squeal on you." -That's what I'm saying. -So am I. He's got nothing against us, nothing at all, we'll just deny everything. Deny everything. Are you sure he won't want more? So we'll kill the fucker. Track back, who's gonna be there for you? Like little kids. That was a handball, Messi, man. Even a blind man could see it! Stop yelling, man! Ouch, what the fuck... Jajina, you cunt, why didn't you pass the ball? Why do you play it if you can't do it? I can't fucking watch this! So fuck off then. Do you realise we need to talk to Robert about the whole thing? There’s no point doing without him. Guys, stop, give me the ball. It's weird, look at this. Let's do some cardio. What the fuck is this? Okay, okay! Fucking dickheads! -You're the biggest dickhead here. -What? You're hiding from us, you're aggressive, you don't answer the phone and we just want to take you for a ride. -To the countryside. -Go to hell. -But otherwise, it was pretty good. -Thanks, Rob. What the fuck was that, you bastard? You fucking cunt. You won’t mess with my mate! You fucker! Fucking faggot! It was Nomad, man, my business partner! Will you ever grow up, Mosquito? We disagree on medium-term strategy. Marketing-wise. You disagree? Nomad just screwed you, do you think we don't know? He left and took all the suppliers with him. I've just had a break. We are a bunch, fucking national elite. -Where are we going? -Mosquito's discovered something. You haven't seen that, a gate to another world. Robert, we want to get it together again, do the RRU again. With you. Like in the old days. I cover your back, you cover mine. Exactly, friendship, reliability, all for one, a mission. A calling. -Absolute reliability. -Exactly, but really absolute. These days even family members would stab each other in the back. Or business partners. Commander, we've got to tell you something. You can't be serious that you went there! Just to see what the bastard looked like. For him to apologise. He's apologised to Mája. He started crying in front of us, didn't he? Don't give me that shit. He was like, "Sorry, lads, I keep thinking of you. I might have shot one of you." He's a bastard, man! You’ve always been tough, you would even endure my old lady. Yes, for sure, you nutter. Are you better? -Yeah, I'm getting better. -Good. -The main thing is it's all working. -You bet. -Hey, so what‘re you doing? -What do you think, just relaxing. -No kidding. -The bees are busy, flapping their wings like mad. -You are right. -Exactly. And who said it was not worth the hassle. If you get some info, get in touch, okay? -I'll double-check that source. -For sure. Cops are digging through that, I’ve got a nose for it, you know. Yeah, but if you know something, tell me. -Yeah, I will call you, of course. -Let me know. -For sure. -He didn't want anything from you? -No. -He didn't blackmail you? -Karlos. -No. He just wanted us to forgive him. An overgrown bunker, the 37 type. The beads of Beneš? Because they were all around the borders? No, ‘cos they were just for decoration. We should have given up on all the English and the French, we should have protected the country ourselves. Exactly. If you don't want to help us, go to hell. That would have been rough. Really rough. But we wouldn't have dodged. You dodge once and your confidence is gone for 100 years. What is it? Come on, pull. Knock, knock. You seem to know it really well here. Follow me. What else can we do? Wow, this is cool. What are these cables? It's tungsten. Mind your heads. It's for the lights. They are crap, they keep bursting. We're really underground. -Careful. -Like tunnel of love. Oh man. A resting place. Yes, a resting place. Hi, Míra. Hello. Are you there? Are you there? Can you hear me? Do you know where you're going, Mosquito? It's a surprise, gentlemen. You must be kidding! It's a cinema! So cool! But this is our cinema! Now it is, but before the war it was military headquarters. A bunker behind the town, the headquarters here, and a mile of underground corridors. Fucking hell. Robik, commander, what an operation this would be! Cinema evacuation! Terrorists in the hall, Operation Avatar! Right in the middle of the town. Give it a rest. Robert, we want to do operation Musil. With you. Who wants operation Musil? Who? Specifically? Specifically me, because I think it's the right thing. I see. So you think it's the right thing. -Because of Babor. -Because of yourself, you fuck! If you hadn't told the blonde cunt, we would be alright now! Now we'll play Santa for him! He's not really a bad guy. He's got us by the balls. Today it's operation Musil, tomorrow someone else. Fuck, we were always interested in one thing only, in enjoying it. The more idiots you piss off, the better. You want a new operation, fine, I'll plan a new one. Cinema evacuation, armed persons in the hall. What do you say? I want to vote on it. Mosquito, you fucker! I want to vote on it. We've always voted. -I cover your back, you cover mine. -Okay, let's take a vote. Who is for operation Musil? I go for any action, my time is different. Jesus, our hypochondriac. -Who is against? -Any operation but this one. Are you happy, Mosquito? Everything according to the rules? Fuck the rules, I thought we were a team. More cool like. Fucking mission, friendship, courage. Enjoy the operation. Ava-fucking-tar! Mosquito. Rules are rules. The girl told me Musil's got 10 million in glass jars! Ten dirty marigolds from shady deals. We could have had a look at them at least. Ten mil, it it? -How does she know that? -Wait! It's not bad at all. -Mosquito, wait! -I don't give a fuck! You don't give a fuck? Do you know where I got the dough? To shut the girl up? I can't know everything. I sold the Hendrix. My guitar, the Strat. Do you know how much I cried? Can you imagine? That's like selling your Mum, isn’t it? I know about the bread, it's not ten, it’s more like eight. I did the security system in his house. -You've been working for him? -Yeah, for two years. So it was lost from the beginning. -Now he's offered to buy my share. -Fuck me... Mosquito, okay, let's do it, but that petrol girl of yours will do it with us. Let her get involved too. Just in case. But Mosquito, this is a different kind of operation. He mustn't recognise me, not even my voice. -Top secret! -Higher level! Yeah, higher level, man! Arny, Mosquito. Dave, Karlos. Mája, you cover us. Hold on, I want to go with you! Shut up and stay here. "LIVE STREAM" Lads, I need you to verify your positions. Karlos, Dave. Roger. Sector A, main entrance secured. Okay. Arny, Mosquito. Roger that, I'm at the back entrance. Top floor okay. Alright, sweethearts, 2 minutes and the noose starts tightening. All except Arny, okay? Roger that. I'm at the back entrance. -What are you doing here? -I'm not gonna sit at home, am I? They should call back in a minute. I'd love to see his face when they get inside. How do you feel, gentlemen? Endorphins on the go. Top. Like in my old skin. -I'd love to fuck right now. -Congratulations. End of chitchat. The object is silent, I'm turning the cameras off. Ten, nine... Arny, get back, I can see you... Eight, seven, six, five, four... Three, two, one. Arms up, this is the police... Are you Andrej Musil? Are you crazy or what? This must be a mistake! You must have mistaken me for someone else. -He's clean! -I want to talk to my lawyer! Search the premises. It must be a mistake. -Who sent you? -Shut up. -Who sent you? -Shut up I say. You fucking cunt! -I want to talk to your boss! -Go to hell with a boss! Knock, knock, shake, pantry, shake. -Nothing, it's not here! -That's not possible, search this place! Hey, get out of here! You fucking bastard, I'm going to fuck you! Stop it, or I'll kill you! Would you like it, Andrej? Do you like getting shagged? I'll kill you for this! I'll remember those pig eyes of yours. My arse! -It's not in here! -That's not possible! Search it! How much, ten? How much? -Fuck all! -What do you mean? I wanted to touch it at least! It's not possible. How come there's nothing? Not a fucking penny! Get back to your place! Bastards! Fuck me, Armstrong 2004, Tour de France! Something’s going on. Someone’s coming, there’s movement. Mája, don't be silly. Forget about it. Mosquito, put it back! We have guests, gentlemen. -I'm going! -Don't! Now shut the fuck up and listen to me, man, you're going to take this off and quick. I know who the fuck you are. Can you hear me, Robert? I've recognized your voice. Houston, we've got problems! Big fucking problems! Relax, just leave no traces behind. -Hurry up! -Okay. Let's go! Fuck, why are you on the floor? Hurry up, let's go! Don't fuck around, Mosquito! Move it! Go, go go... Move it, Mosquito! Police! This is the police! A perfect job, it's yours now. Commander? Is there another unit here? It's a total shambles! Quick! -What's wrong with you? -Nothing. -Mosquito, what's up? -Nothing. Come on, come on! -Where's Robert? -I don't know. -What? -I don’t know! Where's Robert? Mája is somewhere down there. By the house! What is she doing there? She should have stayed on position. No women, no fucking women! Go, go, go! Wait for me! You bloody bastards! Mosquito! Mosquito, what's up? Mosquito, wake up! Take the bloody helmet and let's go! Shut the fuck up! Mirek? I've got something for you. Thank you. Thanks. Is there something you want to tell me? -No. -No? Do you like honey? You smell of honey. Ivana has left me. She's gone with my girl. -She's found someone in Horažďovice. -No shit. And Vendula wants to bugger off to New Zealand, so if you know of anyone... If you know of anyone who'd like to run a smashing boat rental, let me know. I'm going to the Reich for winter. Germans hire Mongolian butchers. A Mongolian chops up a cow in a few seconds. They hired me, too. A Czech is like a Mongolian. It'll all turn around. Boats, girls... It'll be fine again. Only this lover of mine won't turn around. She keeps going. And she goes faster and faster. -You don't drink enough. -Maybe. Hello. Wait a minute! We said no women, commander! That's true, Rob. This is Mosquito's spot. Gentlemen. The cinema houses events for local VIPs. 30 to 40 people. No security. An underground operation. Access through the forest. To the millimetre. Operation Mosquito. This is the police! Remain seated! Shut up! Don't move!
