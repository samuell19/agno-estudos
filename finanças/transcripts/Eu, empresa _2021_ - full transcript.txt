The voices that paint... The noise of the bombs Opened holes in the abyss of the cosmos... I Joder deep, deep on the subway, Where there's smell of gas, they are right... Where there's smell of gas, they are right... Will take some trails, electrocuted on the trails and go back to internet to listen other voices... It's on the news, everything was made for us to slay... Everything was made for us to slay... "Undertake", "I Joder" I, COMPANY My boss has "undertake" carved on wood on his desk. So mediocre I can't even make an original joke. Dude, I'm impressed. one month late on the project, the training, we lost time. What did you mean by saying with "more entrepreneurship?" Man, entrepreneurship is important for anyone that wants to grow... Unless you want to be forever in the shadows being managed by others. If you want to have your business, you've got to be bold. Boldness, bravery, courage. Courage to abandon things and move on to something... I guess the idea was to face things that are difficult at the time. Sometimes courage is not only about plunging in the dark but to have focus and face the moment. I guess you could have done that. You lost an opportunity to learn. I was considering offering you a share of the business... You could... But know I'm frustrated, even ashamed... I guess I was moved because I was losing someone talented. "Enfant terrible", a guy that could make my IT work. And it didn't work out... It was a little frustrating. Hey guys from YouTube! On today's video I wanted to talk about my life my routine... That's why I'm making this waking up, very personal. I live with two wonderful people: Baumga... He is an accountant and has been engaged for 7 years, a wonderful person... Do you see those colors? Those textures? We see them because this food was made for us. You get more connected each time I grab a slice. My other roomie is Lu, she's amazing, an actress... She's always traveling for work and she rents her room for Airbnb so we always get new people here at the apartment. I don’t recall if I told you but tomorrow there’s someone coming over. Rachel. Have her as you always do. Fine, that’s cool. And she seems friendly. The way she talks, super chilly. Ok, right. Have a nice trip. Thank you, have good job! What’s up dudes from YouTube, João Maldito speaking here. Once more here. Today we are at the Shopping Mall. I don’t know if it’s a mall this shit, but look at the people over there eating, everyone so cheerful. Look at that old lady, not that happy, right? We are here getting something to eat. I went to the Mall and I called her to come… Here at Multiplex, I’m already drunk, The smell of popcorn, here we go, everyone happy. Everyone watching movies. Fast and Furious 10, sickening! Fresh release, let’s see what’s the thing. Cars exploding, the same bullshit ten times in a row and people still crowd the cinemas. Damn place! Did you find Fast And Furious? Yeah, I found it. My producers are great, they find things very quickly. Zumba… There’s everything here. Rambo Until the End... Fast and Furious with those two crooks. "The Rock and Derocrock" Let’s watch this movie and see what happens. The reason I’m here is to change my mindset. I feel it’s… They way I behave… I’m trying to manage my life and it’s... It’s not working, you know, Rita? The financial issues have been constant in my life. Failed relationships, layoffs... I feel if I continue like this… I’m a little dramatic but I might end up in the streets. I’m not joking, but I feel I won’t have a very bright future. I mean it. If I keep this path... I won’t have a good future and I wanna try as soon as I can to change my mindset. Change the way I behave, how I live and work, you know? You live based on things that didn’t work, and the coaching process, I’ve always told you: “Marquinhos, coaching is about present and future, where are you and where are you heading to. Failing is a known destination.” That’s why I got mad when you used to say: “I won’t have any money” Why do I wanna know this? You had all the tools, all the potential. You were only linking it to worthless things. What are we looking for? Success and hits. So, in order to have a hit, to be successful, you’ve got to transform this way of thinking. - Do you want to transform your thoughts, Marcus? - I want to. Which resources have you got, Marcus, to change those thoughts, this behavior, this attitude? So, Rita, I…. I wanted to tell you I’ve got a new business. Cool, and what is it? For the first time in my life I guess it’s a natural business for me and It's gonna work. I won’t feel like an impostor doing it, you know? It’s a YouTube channel. Oh, really? Tell me where did this come from. When did you came with the idea? You get here and then tells me…. Tell me how did this came up. So I’ve always worked with video making and it’s been a turbulent process, because technically I was never self-confident… I never saw myself as good enough to do it to other people… The thing is I have a character called Joder, he is the materialization of my failures. So, Rita, I’m putting old Marcus’ failures and insecurities in Joder. In those Joder’s videos I wanna compartmentalize things, you know? Life’s failure and trash will be Joder’s. So in fact, Marcus, the situation you’re facing Is about one thing only. - Which one? - Myself? Money? Myself, money. Everything I do. Is about what? Failure? - About what? - Success. - About what? - An attempt to what? Attempt to what? Well-being? Happiness? - Whose? - My own. - And what impeaches you? - Myself. So, what’s the big problem? It’s me. - And who are you? - Joder. What do you do with yourself? - I ruin my own life. - Ok. We’ve came to a result. One, two, one two... One, two. Now switch. Ready… One, two! Baumga, tell me, how’s your dad going, pal? Man, we are kind of set apart. I haven’t talked to him in three months. - Did you break the bond completely? - Yeah, I did. It all began with some crazy ideas, you know? He became a flat earther… Quickly. - And are you in a fight? - Yeah... Things got heavy and I decided to walk away for my mental health. It’s important. But what about the agency, the equipment and everything? It’s over, over. - Everything? - Yeah, I left the equipment there with him. Everything, I didn’t want anything. Dude, it’s because my tripod is so wrecked… I need one to record a video and I was going to ask you to… You you don’t bother asking him to lend me. That’s fine, I can't do it… No, no, it’s ok. He used to like me, I think it’d be cool. Great, great... How to cure depression alone I like this one, this is good. What do you want to do today? - Good evening. - Hi, how are you? - I’m Rachel. - I’m Joder. Jordan? - Joder. - Joder? J-o-d-e-r. Joder, nice to meet you. Lu told me you were arriving. - Is this Luisa’s room? - Yeah, it’s this one. Whatever you need you can call me or Baumga. I’m home more often, make yourself comfortable. Thanks a lot. - Good night. - Good night. Here I go… We are living the end of the times. Anger, definitely. That bar over the corner, you know? I was 21, I guess, and got wasted. On this beach we celebrate Yemanjá’s party. - That’s pretty. - People give away gifts and offerings. Thanks, bro! Good night! What do you do? I’m a dancer student but I also teach English and work with kids. I was gonna say… Teaching English is a good deal for you here. Yeah, do you want to learn? Yeah, my English is very shitty. - Did you get it? - I get what “shitty” means, so yeah. What else are you doing there? I also work with Reiki, that one to heal the energies. My friend’s mother used to do Reiki. That’s cool, to heal people energetically. I never understood what is people’s energy. We’ve got energies in our bodies, right? Everyone has energy, everything is energy, actually. But we have an energetic field, and we can clean it and purify it. Wow, you’re like a body coaching. - A what? - A coach. A coach, yeah. - Of the body. - It’s a healing, yeah. Can you sense how my energy is? It’s kind of… square. - Square? - Square. I don’t know, I think you can relax a little. - I’m a little stiff, Rachel. - Just a little. I’m trying to change my career, I’m in a tense moment. - I want to become an YouTuber. - YouTuber, yeah. But, anyway, that’s why I think I’m kind of messed up Do you want to be a star? An YouTuber? Yeah, I guess I wanna be a star. - Yeah? - Yeah. We’e got to admit things. I want to be a star. That song from R.E.M… No, from Smash Mouth: “Hey now you’re an all star”. We will be fine, Rachel. We will be fine in life. You in Salvador and me in YouTube. - Cheers. - Cheers. People, this weekend my workshop of digital coaching is with João Maldito. You can’t miss it! Swipe up because the price is now very low and if you lose we won’t have a second edition. See you there! - Hello, Joder. Rachel, I’m gonna fix the circuit breaker and let the water a little cooler, ok? - I’m afraid of electricity. - There’s no need to worry, you can relax. Ok. Turn on now. Hey Cabeça, give me a feedback about the video I've just posted it... See ya! So, dude, I didn't get it quite well... What do you want with it? You talk about failure, but what is failure? This is Brazil, haven't you understood it? Your failure is a success for many people. This is out of it, you know? Shit! Folks, I’d like to talk a little about the experience I had at work. I had a boss… My last boss was a huge impact on me, because I didn’t have the entrepreneurial spirit. I heard this for a long time. But with positive thinking, strategy and a new mindset we can change things. We spend so long listening people say what we can do and what we can’t. But everything is on us. The change depends on us. We can… - Press REC and I’m going... - Recording. Do you feel that smell, Baumga? - Of what? - Poop. I’m afraid this will influence my attitude on the video. Now that you said I smell it too. But that’s ok, let’s try to do it. Do you think is it good? Yeah, man, it’s cool! - Are you ready? - Yeah. Ok, recording. I wanted to make a different video. Speak about motivation, I don’t know. I gotta feel the public’s reaction. We’ve got to test the niches. I guess it makes sense. Tell me if I’m a little down and I’ll put some more energy. Ok. And I was wondering, people, speaking about it today. To talk about motivation, breaking paradigms… When people tell you your whole life that you’re something and you prove them wrong. You can do it, you can change your mindset, do you know what a mindset is? Neither do I. But I’m learning. Learning new things is very important. This video is weird, more alternative, but in fact… I wanted to propose something. Times are hard for the ones who are trying to be always better. Let’s exchange expericences, likes, videos. I want to know you guys, this channel has just began and I want it to grow a lot. That’s it. Do you think is it cool if I walk and then there’s a cut to my line, and then you film the sunlight passing through the bamboos? Something like bam! Bam! If you want to grab the tripod you can walk towards me. Let’s live the moment, man, I’m feeling a super high energy right now. This branch sucks. Yeah, man, I think it’s fine to do it. - Can you do this? - Yeah. And does it take too long? Would you record some kind of statement talking about the company or… I don’t know, it’s up to you. If you tell me it’s not important, I guess it’s important. Talking about the company’s records, you know? If you tell a little about it, I think it’ll be great. I could make an introduction, talk a little about the company… And meanwhile you show other stuff, I don’t know. We could, like, have those images here, and the works, and you speaking… - Yeah, exactly! - Yeah, it can work out like this. And we could… Use this branding that I think is really nice. We want to keep the standards, you know? It looks like a movie poster, this construction behind… - It’s cool. - Was Vainer who did it? No, I had to pay for this one. Vainer now works with movies. Is he on the movies? Poor wretch. There’s a specific fruit for every region, it’s very cool to travel. - Hey, brother! - Hey Lu! Wow, I just got home and I’ll travel again. I wanted to talk to you! - You travel a lot. - Yeah. - How are you doing? - A little down, my channel is flopped. - Really? The video with Ricardo Carvalho only got 103 views. I thought you would be this kind of guy that gets partners, free tickets to concerts... Not yet, not yet... I got a weird email from Eagle Corp… They are making an application like an artificial intelligence, just as Siri, from Alexa? - But for kids. - Wow! And they need kids voices for the app. Yeah, I get it. So when the kids are interacting with the phone… The app talks to them. - It’s another kid voice. - But they want us to record the voices. They said: “If you got kids from 3 to 15 years old that were born in Brazil and speak Portuguese. We’ve got a job for you, to record 160 phrases. - Wow, that’s a lot. - They will pay 10 Australian dollars. - And who are you calling? - I got mad, dude. I’m not calling anyone. - It’s child labor. - Of course, it’s kind of weird. Over a 100 phrases, wow... And you don’t even know what are they doing with the kids’ voices. - Yeah, right. It’s weird indeed. - I got kind of mad about it. And what are you going to do then? I don’t know, I’m not taking it. Yeah, there are some jobs that are not worth it. I guess it’s better to let this money go. Hey! Everything all right? Yeah, man. There was a guy sawing something... The take was very cool. But could you frame everyone? I made some wide shots… And then I’m making some close-ups. There was a time they were unloading some sand. It was great. I don’t know if this will be useful… The guys unloading it. - It’s important to frame everyone. - It’s here, right? I even thought about making an serial take using a drone to frame everybody working. The whole area. To show the size of the construction, right? -A drone? - Let me go down there. Yeah dude, a drone. - Fly over, take pictures. - I haven’t got one. - Haven’t you? - No... It’s important, right? But okay... - I’d really like it. - It costs like three thousand reais. That much? But it’s important, right? I wanna buy one so I can stand out. Because like this the lens are narrow. Ok, there’s no problem. Let me ask you something… The one with the cap? Can you anticipate that payment from the last job? Sorry, got a mensage here. I know the wage is at the end of the month but if I could get half of it a little earlier. - Because I’m broke. - Ok, let’s see it. - We will come up with something. - Help me on that. - Right, later we can talk, right? - Cool. Say it João… Hey, master. Paddle, now back. Go, Axsan. Slided on your own foot? - Is this skateboard for me? - No! - No. - Oh, well… Hey guys, I’m here today with my nephew Rodrigo. Why did you do it like this? Because you introduced me. I’m introducing myself. - But you showed the badge. - No, I just punched my chest. Oh, ok. Businessman in formation, skate teacher, delivery guy and rapper. - Exploited. - Exploited. - Vivant and living. - Vivant and living. Hey Rodrigo, tell us about your routine. I’ve already told you, but you repeat. Rodrigo, delivering stuff and teaching skateboarding. - Delivering what? - Food for people. For those who ask. If it’s for me, let me deliver. - Great. And skate lessons for kids, adults, women, men, whoever. If I want to learn skateboard, do you teach me? Yeah I do. It’s not like the piano that you must learn until a certain age. You can skate at any age, men or women. Have you got an app for the lessons? No, I post it on social media and people follow and write me. Word of mouth also helps. And people come for skateboarding lessons. They like it. So do I. Rodrigo, I was wondering... My channel is about failure. People like seeing me getting screwed. And broke, without future perspectives, these things. As always. They will ask why I am here with someone full of projects. The thing is I also wanna do those things. I wanna be a delivery guy, an uber driver. Because I think I’ll fail. - Get it? - Will you? I think if I turn into a delivery guy I’m gonna get into an accident. Or I’ll have a stroke while delivering something. I’ll die at someone’s living room. They will call the company and say: “Folks, the delivery boy has died!” You can run and I’ll... Wait, let me... Go, go. When I started working I didn’t even have a bike. So I got a rental bike. I was with the rental bike. But I started getting penalties. Because you’ve got to drop the bike within a time range. One day, here at this square, I went to get the bike. And a chubby guy came with his bag ans said: “Fuck man. I thought I was the only one renting.” I had to fix the bike twice. I mean, if I didn’t had the money... With the bicycle I spent… 170 reais once, then 100 more. 270 reais with the maintenance of the bike. A guy went to deliver something at a lady’s house. When he got there he felt sick. He had a stroke and died. The app never knew it. What happened? Then the government came with a prosecution against the application. Then the app, Rappi, created the SOS button. If anything happens, you press the SOS button, the app knows something went wrong. And they send someone to pick the product. The guy stays here? This is the SOS. Someone rescue the product, not the guy that delivered. The guy got a flat tire, then someone else came. The woman said: "It’s this building." People are lazy coming downstairs. 12 reais. I got the bag. I grabbed the bag that had a dish, crossed the track and got to the restaurant. She came downstairs to pick it up. People want comfort. They even buy cigarrettes using the app, for christ’s sake. Be thankful. The boy asked for a soda and a cigarette the other day. A cigarette. - One only or a packet? - One cigarette. The other day at the square... This is happening because of unemployment. A lot of people is unemployed. If we had the opportunity of a formal job, do you think we’d still doing this? Thank you guys, thanks. - How cool. - No. - How cool, how cool. - That’s it. - How cool. - Almost done... - How cool. - That’s it. - Go. - How cool. I like this one. 40 dollars Lu. Thanks. - It’s going to happen. - Oh my gosh, the phrases. "Let’s play". I think on this one we could maybe... Go, do it too, we need other voices... There’s only one kid Do it firstly with yours, then I’ll make mine. - Great. - I think you’ll be better than me. Really? Let’s play! Let’s play! Let’s play! Let’s play! Let’s play! Now let’s do the spoiled kid that is mad at their parents. We could do something like you saying in the end: “I want more”. - And we send it together. - Okay. Go. Let’s play. Mom, I don’t wanna do it... Very good. Fish! Fish! Fish! Fish! Fish! Fish! - It didn’t mix, see? The oil lid. - Thank God. - Let me see the level. - Ok. The level as well, see? It’s not mixed. Now... This must be from the bearing. yeah, the bearing... Now, listen. If it’s the bearing and we test it. If the headstock is burnt, we’ll have to rectify it. Yeah, so send me please a quotation, Nei. If we have to do it all it will be about 700 reais. Oh shit, man. Hey guys! Today I'm seeing some cars to rent. I'm trying to be an Uber, but the situation is not easy. Everything's very expensive, high above my budget I wanted to talk to you, if you're a businessman that has a car, let me use it and I'll promote your brand in my channel. If there's anyone interested write me a message. Right? Lots of kisses! The guy got a strand of my hair and ran away. Maybe he wasn’t on a good day. If you, that got a strand of my hair is watching, I hope you have a good day. The third question was sent by Janinha 92. She asked if I refused a job according to my ethical and political beliefs. Unfortunately, yes. During the elections, they campaigned here in the Northeast trying to convince digital influencers or anyone that had a relevant number of followers, to convince their followers of blanking their vote. Of course I didn’t do this. It's no use having our ideals and canceling our voice in the only moment that we can choose who represents us. Hope you all liked the video. I always want to make great contents for you. Until next time. - Very good, man. - Cool, huh? I think it’s great… To refuse some kinds of jobs. - Totally. - I, Baumga... If someone told me to eat shit for a reasonable money... I’d eat the shit. I admire the girl, she has integrity. I get kind of mad because it makes me think about what I’m doing to my life. We say we are screwed but we perpetuate certain things, We get into some stuff... Yeah, but sometimes you need it too much. We are screwed, Baumga. - We are screwed, man. - Fuck. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been thinking in the future. My last relationships ended up because I couldn’t plan a future. There’s no future, Baumga. There is no future. It’s all over, dude. Why would you commit to anything if everything is coming to an end? I don’t know. Thinking about this is crazy. What is this future we think about? Why do we work to retire? Why do we work to don’t work anymore? Sometimes we do things we don’t want to do, you know? To have stability and when we’re old…. I mean, now you get old and… We work until we die. Work until we die, so we don’t have to work. I don’t know, man... I’ve just seen a Mano Brown’s phrase on twitter: We live our lives dreaming, when we die we wake up. Yeah, something like... - Hey guys. - Hey, Gaba! Everything okay? Everything fine, Gaba? How are you doing? Enjoying the evening? Yeah, great party here. - Is it cool? - And you guys? Are you having a good time? Yeah, we’re watching some videos and talking about life. Great, shall we have a beer now? I’m kind of tired, tomorrow I’ll work early. Come on, just a beer. Maybe tomorrow, Gaba, today I’m not good. Right, right. And the soccer yesterday? What happened? It’s completely fucked up, my team is a crap. So I must get going... - Right. - See ya. Arrocha style. The perfect beat to cry. Accept and go! It's close to the fair... I’m going to hang out otherwise the guys will cry. I got bad, really bad. I started with 99 Pop. Once a girl invited him to a hotel and they had sexual intercourse, and they say she gave him 7000 reais. 7000 reais. That's true, he says it. Have you ever watched "The Incredibles?" Do you know Frozone? Look over there! -He's a great guy! -He looks like him, indeed. He have a lot of characters here, from animations, movies... Do the Frozone eyes! The big eyes! - Hey man, cool? - Hey. Franciel, right? That’s me. There are rumours. I'm not sure. - Here it says so. - So, let’s go. Man, I was saying that your YouTube thing was a mess but do your thing. I'm gonna give you an example from the book: It's a piece of shit, a crap, worthless but I was tricky and sold a lot, can't even say for how much... This YouTube stuff is the same, totally illogical. - Is it here or in the next block? - Turn here. It’s here, right? You, for example, look like a dumb it will work out! That guy Whinderson Nunes. I had never heard about him and he's making loads of money... So the war is tough, a cigarette for 200 men. - I even went to Projac, you know? - And? I recorded a video but they never called me back. Oh, look... Complicated, right? And difficult, I had a small hope. Do you think most of the people got there because they were nominated by someone? It’s not just about talent. You’re talented, you’re gonna make it. There are a lot of factors. - What's up Baumga. - How did you go? I’m so tired, I had 20 rides today. Great. - I’m out, bye. - See ya. How are you? We watched it here, very good. But I haven’t got good news. I think we might have to end the partnership at least for now. Because people really wanted the drone. Our partner has got a contact. Their drone is half the price, you know? So I couldn’t say no. But you know I love you, man. If I could do something you know I would. Unfortunately I won’t be able to hold this one. I did a quick reasearch and a drone costs about 2300 reais more or less. You should make an investment in hardware. That’s it, bro. See you. I’m going to try to talk to the accountant so they deposit the rest of your money. Bye bye. Youtuber… I didn’t want to be an YouTuber but I had to become one. Get it? First because I’m good at it and I found out I was good. And then because I love to make money. There are a lot of crappy people making much more money than me, than anyone in this room. My grandma used to say something funny. She used to say we can only forgive bad people in this life, when they are buying what we sell. I ask: what do you sell? What do you sell? Because nowadays people buy everything. We consume everything. My grandma was always wise, but until today she can’t save a file to a pen drive. My grandma knows how to use a cellphone, unlock it, open a text and click on a link. Then the video loads by itself. Can you see this change in paradigms? I mean, I create something, send it, someone gets it and I get money. I profit. I do my own stuff. Fuck working laws, fuck Silicon Valley. I want to complain about this space that everyone have their eyes on. But do you know what? The thing is knowing who you are. I like to tell the girls about self-esteem. Many girls follow me because they suffer from low self-esteem. They don’t accept themselves as they are. So I try to show those things in my channel. Today it’s a space I can share information about fashion, business and lifestyle. I’m an advertiser, I work with digital marketing, mainly marketing strategy and content. My goal on Instagram is not to be known, but to inspire people and being recognized for that. I'm a blogger, so I decided to create a channel, The Political Body channel. We talk about politics in a multi racial perspective, politics beyond the parties. in a relaxed way, a fresher and younger one. Basically is that. Talking about my life, my truth, my ideas. Chill, bro. Without pretention, keeping it simple. This thing you said... About being my own boss. Without taxes. That’s badass. I started to change a little my content with a different point of view of the city. That’s what I believe nowadays. To share with my followerws the vision I have about the city. and how can we make tourism and value what we got here. Tiago, I don’t know if you remember but we studied together in 2014. We studied Deleuze, André Felix. Fiction… And affections, I’m not sure. I’m glad you’re fine. I’m not that good. Has my minute begun? Yeah. You’ve got 20 seconds. - I’ve got 20 or I spent 20? - Now you have 19, I guess. Can we start over? Because this was just me talking to you. I’m going to give you 20 seconds. Ok, I get a little shy because there’s a lot of pretty young people here. Everyone is 21, it's embarrassing... Is there still time for me to be an youtuber? Come here, João. Is João there? Damn João, come here bro. Amazing, welcome. With you, João Maldito. What’s up, folks? Thanks for the welcoming. It’s a pleasure to be here. Thanks, Tiago, for inviting me. So, people, I’m João Maldito. For the ones who don’t know me, my channel talks about critiques to fancy restaurants clothing stores, and every kind of exploitation of the work. I came here today because once I was sitting right there. I also began from scratch. And now I’m in this business for over ten years. And I ask you: do you wanna be successful as a YouTuber? Yeah, yeah. I guess few people want to succeed here. - Why did you come here for? - Yes! Because for me the business was when I used to sell popsicles or candy at the traffic lights, painting walls, sanding walls, carrying stones, cement bags. I worked at construction companies, I was very exploited. 15 reais a day. Now the thing is making money, because money and time walk side by side. But there’s a big difference, time goes by and money doesn’t. Money is always there. On whose hands we don’t know, But money is always there. The most important thing of everything are our friends and family. And our followers. Because they believe in your job. So never stop believing in you, in your job and in your life. And in your channel, of course. Let’s make selfies. Vertical so we put on stories. A successful failure. He was cross-eyed and a loser. You’re just a loser, it’ll work. You don’t have to be crossed-eyed. He remains because he’s still a loser. Good tip. - Grab failure and go. - And go. Thanks. I’m going to talk to João. Hey, Thiago Almasy e João Maldito. Hey, guys. Hey, Tiago, it was super cool today. Hey, João. João! How did you create your character? It's for my channel. - He studied with me. - I studied with him. Later can we talk like... Come on, dance! Hey, guys, my three followers I wanted to make something different. I’m out of the character. My life sucks. My mental health is a piece of shit. How are you, guys? Debt... Failure... Things that even in Joder are not really funny. To be used with Joder. There’s something depressing. It’s not funny. But that’s it, let’s exchange defeats. Now without characters. I'm recording this video because I saw a girl, Mariana Rios, I don't know if you guys know her. A great ASMR artist from youtube, I met her thanks to Baumga, my roommate. She made a Q&A video for the fans and someone asked her... Ah, I want questions like this too. Someone asked her if she had already refused work because of ethical questions. She said she turned out a job because they offered her money to campaign on behalf of cancelling votes. Imagine her and other YouTubers from the northeast. Weird. Then I thought: Wow, she refused the job, that’s amazing. What a righteous person, I wondered. Who’s screwed do anything for money. Sometimes people accept any job, I don’t know about her financial status but it’s cool. Anyway, she refused this job. Congratulations on your integrity, Mariana Rios. I’m beggining and it’s hard to be a YouTuber I hope I can get to the point when I can refuse jobs because... Even though I have a choice to refuse them. I want to decline the job, even if I’m poor. It doesn’t make sense, what i’m talking, But I guess you guys got it. Hey, what’s up? The water is cold here. We don’t sell anything here, huh? So, that’s. Hey, I can’t see a thing here. Don’t forget to like and subscribe to the channel. Buddy, what’s going on? Hi joder, We have identified an attempt of fraud in the voice recording project for children between 3 and 15 years old in Brazilian Portuguese in the voice samples you have sent to our system. We are disconnecting you and the other employees who tried to defraud this task. Your contract will end effectively today. We wish you luck on future projects. You guys here work for EagleCorp, right? I don’t want to talk to the recording, please. I really need to talk to one of you. I worked there two years ago. I ask a little of sensitivity with my issue. A firing email and that’s it? I spent seven… Links to deepweb. There’s no adress, no mail, no phone number. I got this from a Chinese boy. I came from Salvador Bahia to… Eagle! I just want to talk to you, for God’s sake! It’s not possible that I won’t succeed. A job. Ready, Joana. It’s 39,40. Oh my god... I haven’t got cash. I asked it with my card. You chose cash. I haven’t got. Do you mind if I go to an ATM and you wait for me? - I’ll come back quickly. - Yeah, ok, it can be. - Thanks. - Ok, cool. - I’ll be right back. - Ok. So, people, I’m looking for Joana. That went to get cash and never came back. We left from Tancredo Neves, it was a huge ride. 40 reais, dude. And she made me a fool. "Oh, did I put cash?" This is the situation, I got mistaken. At least I’m trying to make her feel ashamed. She’s not thinking that I’m going after her. If she’s here, I’m embarrassing her. - Are there ATMs here at the airport? - Yeah. Where is it? There’s one down there, second stairway. It can’t be lack of money, for god’s sake, dude. There is no way out. They’re always making over something. There, there she is. Joana! Good evening, flight 2045 to Rio de Janeiro. - Closed. - Closed? Thanks. So, that’s it, folks. Gate closed. She’s inside the plane. That’s over. Hey Camila, fine? Vitoria won. Thanks God. Let me tell you something, I’m free this month. I’ve just finished a huge job. You can call me if you need. Editing and also in set, ok? Hey guys. I’m making this video to reach Joana, my Uber passenger from today. Joana, we had such a wonderful conversation. Are you cool? Yeah, friend, I’m a little desperate about money, I’m going to tell you the truth. This month is fucked up. I lost this job I had. My car broke and, you know. I can do whatever. I’m doing anything, dude. I understand you were about to get into the airport. As you told me you’d follow me on YouTube and other social media. I wish we could reconnect not only for the money. So that’s it, guys. Expanding my horizons, driving Uber, but I wanted to say I’m still on the market as an editor, right? I’ve edited a protestant wedding. Hi Ricardo and Mariana. The guy said: "man, that’s incredible!" Two days later he said it was all bullshit. If you take a song off the marriage video edition it sucks, because there's a cut to each beat of the song. The woman entered the church. The guy put on the ring. He said, take this song off. Because on the music video the guy is drowning for his woman. She’s got to have mercy, you know? So I had to edit again. What matters is the mise en scene from the song. What matters is the feeling, the melody. Do you think Dimitri’s grandma will be aware someone’s drowning in the music video? No! She won’t. What matters is the feeling, the beat. Always have movement in a wedding. Things can’t be still for a long time. The humiliated will be assaulted. Are you driving life to at the River or Salvador? Look at this mustache! I’ve got a job for you, but it’s not a lot of money. Hey bro, I've just seen your video at the beach again making a fool of yourself? What's up with this loser thing? You have your mouth full of teeth, nothing's wrong you have your mommy and daddy, everything, you don't live with them and stay complaining. Such middle class problems! White people problems, you're acting so spoiled. Come on, get yourself together I'm not gonna to take easy on you. There's no such thing! Are you jobless? Come on and search for a job as everyone does. You make yourself ridiculous for people to feel sorry. Do you see how ridiculous it is? Hell! Wake up, kiddo! You're telling me not even for losing I have a vocation. I'm such a loser that even for being a loser I suck! My failure is not valid, my sadness either, who are you to tell me this? Fuck it! I just work, my friend! I work all day, my mental health sucks, what do you want me to do? A culinary channel? Pets? Dogs? Go fuck yourself! Your asshole! Hey guys, welcome to the ASMR. I am Mariana Rios. Today my lineup is a bit different to what you’re used to. Today I’m going to make an answer video to Joder that made a video this week that touched me. I’m very glad that I could pass on my principles to you. That’s my goal. I know you’re trying to make your own YouTube channel. It’s a tough journey, there are a lot of obstacles on the way, but the most important thing is never stop being yourself. And you’re making it perfectly! I’m very happy to have managed to pass this lesson... of showing the person that I am, of knowing that my principles will never be corrupted and that you also think the same way. Don’t give up, I’m with you. When I got to YouTube I had like 100 notifications. I thought: Damn! Mariana Rios saw the video I spoke about her. And she answered me, said my name, “For you, Joder, you’re young, don’t give up, you’re cool.” On her channel. I got like 80 new followers and a lot of comments on my video. A lot of comments from people I don’t even know. Real people, other people. Man, I’m happy and scared. Even Thiago Almasy commented and João Maldito liked his comment. Damn. How cool. Cool Baumga? How many followers does she have? Imagine if 10% saw it… Yeah, sure. You’re on a good path. I think you should go on but with low expectations. No, no… - Those things are fleeting. - I know. But cool, dude. Really cool. Hey guys, this is a special video for my new followers. It’s special and weird. I have a weird feeling, but it’s from gratitude. I wanted to talk to my new followers... You guys hugged me you hugged me, and it's very weird. This is a special video for my new followers. Thank you, let’s talk about it, but it’s weird. A little weird for me, it’s weird, very weird. It’s weird, weird, weird. Fucking weird. It’s good, but weird. A little weird, you know? But it’s good. But weird. It’s weird, weird, but it’s good. But it’s weird. Weird, it’s weird, weird, it’s weird. Thank you a lot! Thanks to my new followers! A thousand! Gratitude! Thanks! Really... The Joder family is growing... We're in this! Hey family! We're 3k, three thousand followers! Kisses for everyone! Let's go forward! Hey guys, towards the top! 5k! And up! Look! Look! 5 thousand! The great day came... Now you can swipe up you know why? 10k! I'm so happy! Ten thousand! People, I wanted to apologize who follows me knows I said some bullshit. I flipped out... This is not me. I regret so much of what happened. If I offended someone it wasn't my intention. I apologize deep from my heart. Who follows me since I was a loser knows that nowadays I'm positive... I try to show you how life can be wonderful and I know what I say influence a lot of people and I have to be careful so I am really sorry. Truly. I have a lot to learn, and I hope you can forgive me so we can grow together. I apologize deep from my heart.
