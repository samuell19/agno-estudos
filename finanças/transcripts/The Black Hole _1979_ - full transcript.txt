THE BLACK HOLE 2130, day 547. A course correction will be made at 22:00. Checks before the correction. Rotation axis: plus 3 degrees. Nitrous oxide pressure: 4100, rising to 5000. Quadreactors C and D pre-selected. Sequence of ignition in 30 minutes. Propellers waiting. - Vincent, tell me at -15. Alex? - Yes, Dan? The difference between ETAs With and without correction? I'm working on it. To correct now is strange. Vincent, check our last fixed position according to another star. She is correct. But I think I found the reason for our deviation. Lieutenant Pizer? I think you should come and see. - What is it, Vincent? - The biggest black hole I've seen. Holographic projection, please. My God ! Straight out of Dante's Hell! Yes. The greatest destructive force of the universe. She swallows even the light. One of my teachers said that black holes would eventually snap up the whole universe. That could be. Giant suns are engulfed without leaving traces. - Expansion. - Polarization of the image. Whenever I see one I expect to see a horned devil. - It's a real monster. - He devours the space-time himself. - But I detected something else. - Let's see. He has not moved since I spotted him. It looks like a ship. - Do you get that, Alex? - 5 out of 5. Zoom in again, Vincent. Let's try to identify it. But who can be there before us? Arcturus 10, United Kingdom. Liberty 7, USA. Russian experimental station of series 5. France, Sahara module 53. Pluto 4, Japan. - USA, space probe 1. - That's it. USS Cygnus. Kate, was not that your father's ship? The USS Cygnus ... Its mission: Discover living habitats in space. Like us. Send him a signal, Vincent. Charlie, activate the detectors. They were recalled to Earth 20 years ago, their mission considered a failure. - Professor Hans Reinhardt must have been disappointed! - Did you know Captain Reinhardt? To be more precise, I ran into him. - It was a living legend. - That's what he thought. He was passing his own ambition for a national point of honor. He led the space budget commission in the worst fiasco in history, then refused to admit his failure. He ignored their reminder. Maybe he never received it. The ship has completely disappeared. We never heard from them. Dan, bring us there. Vincent and I will get on board. According to Cicero, the youth is daring, the average age is cautious, and courage shines in discretion. There is no reason to leave this mystery whole. Yes, there is one, Harry. She is straight ahead. What do the detectors say? Nothing, but with these turbulences, our signal could be lost. He has not moved a centimeter since he was spotted. How can a wreck defy such gravity? - That deserves to be studied. - It does not make sense to me, Alex. But we'll go see that more closely. Charlie, coordinates. Thrusters thoroughly, Vincent. Fasten your seatbelts. We will be subjected to a serious gravity ... now ! Distance: 29551, decreasing. - Data on the Cygnus, Vincent? - Always fixed, according to the triangulation. - Gravitational force? - 0.2450, increasing. Put us in the 85 degree release position. Speed 1/3. - 85 degrees. The ship is up! - Gravity? - 0.46960, still increasing. - I switch to manual. Captain, the engines will not withstand such a long time. Alex, gravity is near the maximum. We make a passage and then we leave. - Zero gravity! - Shut down the engines. Like on velvet. It's like being in the eye of the cyclone. What happened ? A natural phenomenon ... or so ... it comes from this ship. I activate the microprojector. Do you get something, Charlie? Negative. This time our signal passes necessarily. - Maximum gravity! - He attracts us. We start to turn. 100% retro-propulsion! Propulsion thoroughly! Leak of air to mid-ship! We lose oxygen! Main thrusters at 180 degrees! Here too, we have a leak! Emergency! Main and secondary air arrivals broken! It is the bouquet ! Propellers A and B thoroughly. We are sucked by the black hole! I switch to manual. Another hatch jumped. I go out to close it. Be careful outside. - It has never been so serious. - Yes, my captain. Alex! We must go see the damage below! Vincent, are you receiving me? Vincent, answer! Kate, we have either a breakdown or too much interference. Try telepathy. I hear Vincent. He says there are old pilots and daring pilots, but there are very few old and daring pilots. It's Vincent all spit! On my leg, fast! - It's okay ? - Yes. That's it ! Put the eraser, Charlie, you have to reach zero gravity. - Vince closed the hatch! - Well. We can only repair temporarily the secondary circuit! You have to change parts of the main regulator, or we will lose oxygen! Bad luck ! Dan! The cable has cut. - I go ! - Stay in your job, Charlie! Do not you have a heart? - And if it was one of us? - Vincent is one of us. Reverse the thrusters and look where to ask us. - What is going on ? - I would like to know. - Illuminated like a Christmas tree. - Cannons in firing position. No, he must be friendly. They could have blown us up. Your side, Dan. Do you have an image? - There are people on board. - It's just a shadow. An enlargement, please. They are people, Alex. I know it, I feel it! Platform docking approach. - Why did not they do that earlier? - I do not know and I do not like it. But we have to rely on them to repair. I'm sorry for getting upset. I think we all have a thing for him, Charlie ... - Yes. - Well, let's go. We have gravity! - Nice job, Vincent. - Hope this is the end of our troubles. - You have nothing, Vincent? - Nothing but bumps and oxidation. It's up to us to take the first step. - Charlie, stay on the Palomino. - But ... Come on, Mr. Pizer. "To serve is also to wait." - Are you programmed to bother me? - No, to educate you. If I had known that I should serve as a stooge to a pile of junk ... Looks like it has not been used for years. I have the curious impression that we are being observed. Vincent! - Charlie? - Vincent, you have nothing? Weapons destroyed by lasers. No injuries. Stay in place. Vincent. - Are you sure you're okay ? - Touched, but never sunk, Pr Kate. Friendly, you speak! Come on, Harry, they could have killed us a hundred times. I do not like another pulling the strings. Neither do I. From up there, someone controls each of our movements. Someone ... or something, Captain. - Easy, Kate. - Hard to stop me from hoping ... I must tell you that I am not very reassured. Some of my peers have been assigned to the Black Hole Project, to send telepathic messages from probes. A "great experience" for scientists. - It's old story, Vincent. - Not for me. Not so close. We are quickly melted in such heat. Oh! I am Kate McCrae. Is Frank McCrae on board? It seems that they are robots, Pr Kate. Look there ! Unbelievable ! There is interest. Given what it cost the taxpayers ... Kate ... We have a visit ... Please login. State your type and model. - An unknown creature. - Not moving. Charlie, are you receiving me? Answer, Charlie. It's the end of the story, Harry. A ship of robots and computers controlled by this ... thing? Not quite, Pr Durant. Maximilian and my robots command this ship according to my wishes. Do you know my name? We have been watching you since our instruments have detected you. Maximilian, calm down. Do not worry about being smaller than you. This pretty little robot is not mean. Miss McCrae, you can get close. Welcome aboard the Cygnus. Hans Reinhardt! Impossible ! You have always had the chic of theatrical entries. Pr Reinhardt ... My father ... Where is he? My dear child, I am sorry to ruin your hopes. Your father has passed away. He is dead. You can be proud of him. It was a big loss for me. A man of trust and a faithful friend. And you are his daughter. Yes, the same eyes. The same eyes ... - And the rest of the crew? - They did not come back? No. What a pity. Such a good crew ... What happened when you were called back? I have to report to you, Mr. Booth? I lost the habit, but if you do, I will answer. Do not be scared. Nobody is going to hurt you. The Cygnus was put out of action by a meteorite field. Our main and emergency communication systems were destroyed. We were adrift. I told the crew to abandon the ship. To follow the order of return to Earth. You may call it one of my theatrical gestures, Mr. Booth, but I chose to stay on board. Your father chooses to stay with me. We never heard from each other. You lived here twenty years alone? 20 years... 20 years old! But I did not really live alone. I created companions, so to speak ... It looks a little medieval, but I'm a romantic. Mr. Pizer! - Come join us ! - Thank you ! You met the gorillas? "Gorillas" ... fun. I introduce myself, Hans Reinhardt. Forgive me for this incident, but you have been disarmed for your safety. Break. My robots are programmed to react to any act of aggression. - That was not our intention. - I am happy. Consider yourself as my guests. We will not abuse your hospitality. - Just the time to repair. - Then you can come back with us. Do you think I want to leave? The Cygnus is in danger here. So that's what your captain feared! One step too much ... and we are lost. But we have nothing to fear. Our antigravity forces allow us to maintain our position. We could call it being between two fires. If you watched us, you must have received our signals. - Indeed. - You did not answer. Should I answer? Little communication problem. Maximilian will provide you with everything you need to repair. In the meantime, you and Professor McCrea will gather enough information to make your mission historic. - Back, Vincent. - Not before him. In front of a compactor, it is not brought back. See, what does it remind me of? Ah yes ! David and Goliath. A classic confrontation. Except that this time, David can not win. Recall it, Reinhardt. Remember it, damn it! On my ship, you have to ask, Captain. Certainly... Please, remember, professor. Maximilian ... Remember: These are our guests. Let him in. Show them our good manners. It's good. Communication problems or not, he was slow to light. Be careful. The other robots are no better than this Frankenstein creature. The bigger they are, the harder the fall. You should have said that with a smile, Vincent. This ship does not look so damaged. No, we repaired and became operational again. - But you never came back. - It is true. I refused that order. I had other imperatives. Other worlds to explore. The dreams of a lifetime to achieve. The authorities will still see it as an act of piracy. What would you have said if the authorities had recalled Christopher Columbus just before he discovered America? You would not be here. I will soon prove to you that the end justifies the means. It does not matter, here, Max ... what are they preparing for? Charlie ... Continue without me. I return to the ship to take care of the regulator. No need to show me the way, I will find everything alone. We need primary and secondary pressure regulators and a flow rate. Max? Mr. Reinhardt told you to supply us with spare parts. Have you integrated? That's right, Max. Very well. Vincent, Vector of CENTRalised Information. Contingent 396. I see you're from that good old 28, programmed in Houston. There is enough instant energy here to feed the entire Earth. The first step to colonize the entire galaxy. You will be known as one of the greatest space engineers in history. I never doubted it. It's time for people to learn that I succeeded where they failed. You should go home with us to enjoy this success. I do not want to go home and I do not care about glory. There is too much at stake to turn around. I have a big project about to end. This is just a start. - A beginning of what? - You'll know it in due course. Could you demonstrate that incredible energy? Follow me, I'll show you everything. I call that the Cygnium, the name of the ship. I had to get lost on the way, Max ... Sacred decor! I said: You have a lot of decor here. You know how to speak ? Are you programmed to speak? Must believe that no. No, I guess that would make you a little too real, huh? Decidedly, this Reinhardt likes to take himself for God. Hold on ! - I know what I saw. - We do not bury the robots! I did not say it was one. I do not know what it was, but he did it with all the pomp of a human burial. Reinhardt may have lied. There may still be survivors. - What do you think he's cooking up? - No idea. In any case, it allows us to recover. "A wolf is a wolf, even if he has not eaten your sheep." Barely. The sooner we leave, the better it will be. As you wish. Let's hurry, Vincent. We do not empty the sea with a spoon. If the spoon is full, she is already doing her best. Thank you, Vincent. - Fascinating. - Yes, from a distance. Are you interested in black holes? How to ignore the worst destructive force of the universe? - The long black tunnel to nowhere. - Or somewhere. These are the questions I intend to study. You knew how to defy the force of gravity of a black hole. It's a huge success. - You find ? - Yes, absolutely. Thank you. Mr. Durant, I believe ... that you, you are a man who aspires to personal success ... but who has not found his way yet. I am wrong ? Maybe I could find her here ... if you're in no hurry to leave. If we talked about a dinner? - It's just a dinner. - Said the spider to the fly. If I came? - To start again with Max? - I do my business, of that one. - Do you ever think you're defeated? - There are three categories: The "yes" do everything, the "no" reject everything and the "do not know" do not try anything. Give us a favor, be a "do not know" with this monster. We need you in working order. So, look at that, Vincent. You will be able to have fun. - I do not like being between robots. - Try to relax a moment. - We all want to bask in the sun. - "Too much sun makes a desert." - Call me if there is a problem. - Come on, Vincent, go have fun with them. This is not the first time we are in trouble, and we will get out. Yes sir. - Who is it, the big head? - GAFS Special Forces Armed Guard Sentinel's prototype of Reinhardt. It was the best, before Maximilian. We are better than him. Have you ever faced him? - Once. - So what ? I beat him and he farted the lead. He took revenge. He did things I do not like to think about. I have great experiences aboard the Cygnus, sometimes dangerous. For your safety, I advise you to avoid ... unescorted tours during your stay. You understand ? - Of course. - Well. Please sit down. Captain... So, Mr. Booth, what news of the Earth? It has hardly changed since you left. Nothing ever changes very much. Same stories, new heads. Do you still write for the same newspaper? Still on strike? Fresh mushroom soup from my personal garden! I remember writing on your big farm station. Big enough to feed the whole crew, I think. Today, she is tiny. Just enough for one person. Ah of course. Our wine as our spare parts are vintage. Are you satisfied ? We had to modify some parts, but it should go fast. We will be able to leave soon. Speak for yourself, Dan. I think I have a lot to learn from Pr Reinhardt. Thank you. Our mission is over, Alex. I make a toast to you and your companions, Mr. Durant ... in honor of your visit to the Cygnus. Welcome aboard, Miss Kate. The only Terrans to know about my existence. And to you, Captain, and to your tremendous achievements. Tonight, my friends, we are on the eve of an unparalleled feat in space exploration. If the data reported by my probe match my calculations, I will go where no man has dared to venture. In the black hole? In... through... and beyond ! It's crazy! It's impossible ! The word "impossible," Mr. Booth, exists only in the vocabulary of idiots. - Are there others like us here? - I am the last. These pushy people take me for an old fool. Our model is still the best. We can not improve perfection! Oh, my God, he wants revenge! As said this hero of the navy: "Forget the torpedoes and go for it!" He also talked about pulling the devil by the tail. Well aimed, Bob! You would have beaten him if he had not pushed you. No, I missed on purpose. Do not worry, I'm going to save the honor of the old guard. Stop! My name is Vincent, and my specialty is shooting. I defy you. Your shuttle-probe did not enter the black hole itself. How will you avoid the Cygnus being crushed by its strength? With, I presume, a strong enough antigravity force field. Indeed. And you will tell me that a navigation error can be fatal. But I'm sure of myself. The trajectory of the Cygnus will take the optimal angle of rotation. The vortex will move us at great speed and this angle will propel us through. Nice shot, GAFS Simple, but good. Clever. So try to do that. "When we danced, we have to pay the violins." If there is one thing I hate, it's the bad losers. Join me at the reserve. So you want the Palomino to follow the progression of the Cygnus? Yes, I need you to take this trip to another dimension. A place where, if we are lucky, I will be able to discover "the ultimate knowledge". Yes, Maximilian? The shuttle-probe arrives. Continue without me. He is completely cracked. My name is Bob. Biosanitary Battalion. I could not talk to you freely. If Maximilian knew, that would be the end of us. Can you rearm my lasers permanently? Yes, I can do that. Vincent, you and your friends are in great danger. Reinhardt lit only to protect the Cygnus. It's a death ship. What does your instinct tell you, Kate? Pr Reinhardt is on the razor's edge between genius and madness. - For me, he's crazy. - Disagree. In any case, he's a liar. His "little personal garden" is big enough to feed an army. It's normal. It is to purify the air. Tell them the funeral, Dan. A burial robot almost human. 20 years of isolation may have made this man eccentric, but do not say he has programmed emotion robots. I know what I saw. And we have only his word on the fate of his crew. All I know is that this robot was also almost human. - And he was limping low! - A malfunction scares you? Of course not, but I tell you that I had the visceral sensation ... to be in front of some kind of ... - a kind of person! - What is your point ? We'd do well to bow and leave the ship! Wait a minute, Dan. You have to think about the situation. If Reinhardt can defy gravity to the point of staying here, - he can also tear himself away from here. - So what ? So why not come back to Earth with this ship and Reinhardt? - It would not be easy. - Oh, come on! We would have two scientific geniuses to computers. They could even reprogram the robots! And to us three, we can control Reinhardt and his kind of monster. You know, we could all come back as heroes! Or feet in front. These poor women are the rest of the crew. Held alive by some means. Humans ? They are more robots than men. Do not hang around here. Too late ! Warning ! Do you detect others? The way is clear. Let's get rid of the evidence. To the report with Maximilian I will check the computers myself. - When are they going to get them? - It depends on their roster. So we have to act quickly. He neglected his duty to his country in favor of a higher ideal. So what ? What are you basing your speculations on? Okay, his style is out of the ordinary, but he wants to share his knowledge with us. - Let's not stay more than necessary. - It's up to Reinhardt to decide. Vincent wants you to join him at the Palomino right away. Come on, Charlie. I will follow the movement. Let's go before they see us. Reinhardt will solve the mystery that has always escaped man. Or he will die trying. Alex ... I'm starting to feel that you want to go with him. For a pilgrimage going straight to what could be the spirit of God? Yes, it's true. "There was darkness on the surface of the abyss, and the Spirit of God moved over the waters. " What an incredible view. I still have not got used to it. Where are the others ? - They were called back to the ship. - Recalled? Did not I say: More unescorted tours? How did you get the message? Oh, telepathy with the robot. Extraordinary. - Pr Durant ... - Yes, professor? This contains all the formulas I have developed over the years. I want you to take them away and transmit them, in case something happens to me. You can count on me. I also want you to follow my experience closely. Stay as long as you can on the horizon of the black hole. The possibility of a nodal point must be considered. Including. Believe me... I have long waited for a man like you to testify to this. Thank you. So I'm ready. Ready to embark for the biggest trips. And the most risky. The risk is negligible when one has a chance to possess the great truth of the unknown. There, our dear laws of nature no longer apply. They disappear. And life ? Life ? An eternal life. Frank McCrea had all their confidence. Kate's father. They turned to him when Reinhardt ignored the return order. They wanted to evict him. Reinhardt shouted at the mutiny and killed McCrae. - What happened to the crew? - Captured. He is always on board. - What? - Where ? In the control tower, at the power station ... Robots, Mr. Pizer. Humanoid robots. The most precious good of all, the life of the spirit ... does not mean anything to Reinhardt. Deprived of conscience, the crew became controllable. That explains the funeral, and the lame robot that you saw. Do you mean that there is a human body under these clothes? Just, Mr. Booth. We can not take off by abandoning these poor devils. - Harry, we'll have to follow your plan. - What? And finish like the others? If they have failed, what are the chances? The damage is irreversible, Captain. Only death can free them. There you go ! For God's sake, Dan, we're not tall. I had to destroy two sentinel robots. - If the others find them ... - Understood. Charlie, start the countdown. Vincent, come back Kate and Alex. Program the trajectory. You accomplished all this alone, Pr Reinhardt ... and you would have all the rights to reject the request of a stranger, but ... What do you hope, Alex? Immortality? No, the scientific truth. Alex, we have to board. They are waiting for us to leave. Prepare the reactors! Maximilian! - Vincent, everything is ready? - All circuits are operational. Alex, I will not let you sacrifice yourself for that. - He can do it. I know it. - Good God, Alex! There is an entirely different world on the other side, where space-time as we know it no longer exists. We will be the first to see it, to explore it, to experience it. God, Dan! If we wait for Alex, it will be too late! Do not you see that guy has completely hypnotized him? Vincent, tells Kate to come back everything with or without Alex. Tell him why. Reactors on! He will do it! He will do it! He will really do it! We will die if we do not take off! He wants us to watch him from the outside. We have time. - I refuse to take the risk! - Shut up, Harry! Alex ... Alex! Can I talk to you for a minute? B squared ... on A squared, by ... Do you remember what we talked about? - We have to leave here! - Me, I stay! - Reinhardt is a murderer! - What? These creatures are not robots, they are ... humanoids. What's left of the crew? What is it, Miss Kate? You look bad. - Kate is angry because I stay. - I hope she will stay too. No I do not... - Why change your mind? - No, I ... It's the right time to go to the black hole. But what are you doing? Without that, he would be dead. They would all be dead. It was the only way to keep them alive. - One of my biggest successes. - But ... you told us that the crew was gone. All this had to be created by something ... but what created this thing? Come on, Kate, we're leaving. Maximilian! You should not have! He was a valuable man. Protect me from Maximilian. If there is justice, the black hole will be your grave! Take the girl to the hospital. You can take off, Captain. M. Durant and Miss McCrae want to stay. I told you ! Alex completely swallowed his theory! Pr Durant was killed by Maximilian. They take Professor Kate to the hospital. Vincent, ask Bob our way. Maximilian, take us there! We may still have time. Take off before the gravity is too strong. - Take off whatever happens! - Have a nice trip back, lt Pizer. Come back to us in one piece! It's time to liquidate our guests. - Come on, come on, old Bob! - Do not wait for me ! Turn on the thrusters! This crazy takes us right on the black hole! What are we doing ? We wait. Charlie! Kate is fine. We arrive. Not too soon ! It's going to be limited! Let the sentries shoot at every humanoid between the hospital and the Palomino. They foiled us! It worked so far. Start going down. Vincent, you have to find a feint. Take them on the back. Well done, old Bob! You're okay ? My first fight in 30 years! I wish it were Reinhardt and Max. Your cracks were fooled and crushed by a land robot and this antiquity of the reserve! You can not put the Cygnus in danger by blowing them up too early. Let them go a little further, then break them to pieces! - Charlie, are you getting me? - Five out of five. Send Harry to the hatch and give us 60 seconds. Where are you? Near the reception. We will force the passage. Start counting. Dan, how are you? Charlie, cancel the last order. Go now. I repeat: Take off. - You heard it! - Stop talking and move! - The cow ! - Harry, are you touched? - My leg. - It's serious ? I think it's broken. - Can you go back to the ship? - I believe. Well. We're counting on you to keep the ship. Well done, Charlie! But what is he doing? Harry! Make him jump before he hits us! Fire! I suspected it! What a coward! I should have locked him up. It saved our life. - "As long as there is life ..." - He did not do that for us. "When the wine is pulled, you have to drink it." - You and your gum proverbs! - "Aggression is the best defense." What? Attack Reinhardt and turn around? Too late ! - There is an alternative! - The shuttle-probe! Good idea ! - A meteorite hit the ship! - Go quickly ! A whole meteor shower! The black hole sucks them! It will have to go through the main hall! Down ! Hold on, Kate! Drop in, Charlie! I hold you, Bob! Leave me, Captain! Save yourself! - We must continue! - It's frozen! - Quick quick ! - All right, Charlie, go! Maximum power! We will visit you ! That's it, the meteor shower has passed. DANGER ! CAUTION OVERLOAD Maximilian! Prepares the shuttle-probe. Maximilian! Help me ! Fools ! You hear me ? You hear me ? Help ! Does anyone hear me? Using ... using ... Vincent! The light ! - We have to go. - No, I can not do it. I lost my flotation, my main circuit is grilled, - and the backup circuits let me go. - You can do it ! It's too late, Vincent. My service is coming to an end. But part of me is with you. You will never be obsolete. Keep our tradition. We're the best. - Charlie! - Help ! - The whole ship is falling apart! - Have a good time. Hang in there! We take off. - Antigravity engaged. - The orders do not answer! Captain, the shuttle has been programmed. For Reinhardt ... Do you mean we're going into the black hole? - Yes. - Pray for him to be a genius. Help! Life ... Reinhardt ... my father ... Where is he? Assassin! The black hole sucks us! We may already be dead ... We are the best ...
