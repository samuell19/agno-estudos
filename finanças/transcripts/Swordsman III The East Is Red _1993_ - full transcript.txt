We'd emerge from the sea at once. Koo must be waiting for me. Well, let's go up. Asia the invincible! Focus the top of their sail. Asia the invincible, you show up eventually. Get ready the Cannon! Asia the invincible? But you are not better than me at leading the troops. You've got the magic power from "sacred scroll". Although this is your personal achievement, it can't make you achieve great success. That's why your troops didn't attack, but were destroyed at the black cliff. Bull shit! My failure was caused by my foe whom I admired. I didn't want to hurt him, thus I pretended that I was kill dundee the cliff. Last time, you could escape because of the "sacred scroll". Now, the history is repeated. If you had not had the luck to adopt the "sacred scroll", you'd not have escaped from my attack. You're qualified to be a great martial arts master only. But being a king or a great general, you are not qualified to be named a sassier the invincible. I want to be king, I have to recruit a great general first. I want you to be my general, so I will show you my power. If I had practiced the sacred scroll. You'd not have defeated me. Anyway, our fight should have been over. You're wrong! Our fight has not been over yet. Give it to me. It's too easy to defeat you. Your 14 valves are both live and dead. Let me open your closed valves. Your kungfu will be improved greatly, so you are able to fight with me. Koo, watch it. Snow, I said... I didn't hope to see you in the battlefield again. I want to see Asia the invincible. Snow! Snow, I will save you. Only Asia the invincible can save me. Snow, come back to me now. Holy master. Do you think it's worth doing it? I have waited for this moment. I know you come for me. Koo, get lost. Koo, return snow to me. I won't return her to you. Come to get her yourself. Asia the invincible, you are always alone. Why do you follow me? Don't go! Snow, no matter how, I have to take you back. But what a pity that, you could never hear what he said. Otherwise, you'd be very happy. Hand her to me. Asia the invincible, it's useless for anything you said. She could never hear you. You are lying! You have never trusted anybody. You've made it. But you have got no one to stay with you. Asia the invincible, you always want to search for yourself. Actually, what you have done, either good or bad, that's you. I don't need you to tell me. What a pity that, you are always making remedy to what you've lost. But, you never treasure the things you've gained. I want you to lose what you have gained. Well, but I want her back now. Snow. Let's start from the very beginning. Asia the invincible.
