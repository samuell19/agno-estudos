NOW NONE OF HIS NARRATIVE POEMS EITHER RHYME OR SCAN, BUT "CONSISTENCY IS THE HOBGOBLIN OF LITTLE MINDS." THAT'S POPE, I THINK. I WISH YOU COULD'VE HEARD FROST. HE WAS A SHOWMAN. I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM. HE CAME OUT IN FRONT OF A LECTURE HALL NOT UNLIKE THIS ONE. HE WAS A VERY NEAT LITTLE FIGURE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SORT OF FRESH WHITE LINEN, A SHOCK OF WHITE HAIR, VERY NEW ENGLAND, LITTLE BOW TIE. AND HE CAME UP TO THE LECTERN, AND HE SAID-- VERY SOLEMNLY HE SAID, "I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN WITH AN INVOCATION." SO WE ALL LOWERED OUR HEADS, AND HE SAID, "FORGIVE, O LORD, OUR LITTLE JOKES ON THEE, AND I WILL FORGIVE YOUR GREAT BIG ONE ON ME." ( all laughing ) THAT'S WHAT WE DID. WE LAUGHED. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID? HE LOOKED BACK AT US, AND HE SAID, "WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING? YOU'RE 20 YEARS OLD. YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. ( scattered laughter ) ALL RIGHT, FOR MONDAY PLEASE, "THE WITCH OF COOS," "DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN." TERM PAPERS ARE DUE MARCH 26th, WHICH IS NEXT FRIDAY. THANK YOU, AND HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND. HELLO.

YES, SOMEBODY MUST'VE SEEN HIM, AND WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM, BUT IF YOU OPEN THIS UP TO THE PRESS RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE GONNA GET THE CRAZIES AND THE HATERS AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THOSE FUNNY DREAMS. I DON'T CARE IF I HAVE TO TALK TO EVERY LUNATIC IN THIS CITY. - SOMEBODY HAS SEEN MY BOY. - NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO COME IN OR OUT. - UNLESS YOU PLAN TO KNOCK ME DOWN-- - LIEUTENANT, I TOLD HER THE KID WAS MISSING. I TRIED TO ASK HER SOME QUESTIONS AND-- RIGHT. TELL ME, HOW CAN I HELP YOU? THANK YOU. THEY SAY THERE'S NOTHING TO DO BUT WAIT. - EXCUSE ME, I'M LIEUTENANT MENETTI. - ( phone ringing ) - I'M MARGARET MAYO, MRS. SELKY'S TENANT. - Hello, Susan? - This is Martina Pierce. - TELL ME, HAVE YOU CALLED YOUR PARENTS OR GRAHAM'S? - Can she come to the phone? - YOU CAN'T LET THEM HEAR IT ON THE NEWS. - WHO IS THIS MARTINA? - Margaret: A NEIGHBOR. - HELLO. - Susan, we just heard.

YEAH, COULD YOU JUST PICK UP THAT STUFFED ANIMAL FOR ME, SUSAN? 10 SECONDS. OKAY. ( clears throat ) THANK YOU, TONY. WE'RE HERE TONIGHT ON REMSEN STREET AT THE HOME OF DR. SUSAN SELKY, WHERE TODAY TRAGEDY STRUCK. DR. SELKY'S SIX-YEAR-OLD SON ALEX, WHO YOU SEE IN THIS PHOTOGRAPH, LEFT FOR SCHOOL THIS MORNING AS USUAL, BUT THIS MORNING WAS NOT A USUAL ONE. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE CORNER OF HENRY STREET AND HIS SCHOOL TWO BLOCKS AWAY, YOUNG ALEX DISAPPEARED. MORE THAN 12 HOURS LATER, HE IS STILL MISSING. DR. SELKY, I UNDERSTAND THE POLICE WEREN'T CALLED until 3:30 this afternoon. Could you tell us what caused this delay? I didn't know. When he was late getting home from school, I called a friend of his, and I found out then that he'd never got there. Woman: Dr. Selky, isn't six years old very young for a child to be walking alone to school? No, not in this neighborhood. He's almost seven. He's very responsible. He has two short blocks to walk before the school crossing guard. I watched him go to the corner, and he crossed Remsen Street. He waved to me. - I HADN'T REMEMBERED THAT. - POLICE ARE NOW ENGAGED IN A HOUSE-TO-HOUSE SEARCH OF THIS BROOKLYN NEIGHBORHOOD, HOPING TO FIND SOMEONE WHO MIGHT'VE SEEN ALEX THIS MORNING. DETECTIVE ALBERT MENETTI OF THE 85th PRECINCT TELLS US THAT DESPITE INTENSIVE POLICE EFFORTS, THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO LOCATE THE BOY'S FATHER, GRAHAM SELKY, A PROFESSOR AT N.Y.U. WHO IS SEPARATED FROM HIS WIFE. AT THIS HOUR, THEY ARE NOT YET WILLING TO NAME HIM OFFICIALLY A SUSPECT. ON REMSEN STREET TONIGHT, A MOTHER'S NIGHTMARE. THIS IS VIVIENNE GRANT, W.O.R.-TV NEWS. NOW BACK TO THE STUDIO. YOU DID FINE, MRS. SELKY. TELL BOROUGH I'M GONNA NEED WARRANTS. I WANT TO GET INTO ALL THE HOUSES ON HENRY STREET, AND I WANT TO GET INTO THAT ALLEY BETWEEN THE HOUSES. YOU'RE WASTING TIME LOOKING FOR GRAHAM. GRAHAM WOULDN'T TAKE ALEX. I TOLD YOU THAT. NOW LOOK, MRS. SELKY, I'VE SEEN A LOT OF CUSTODY FIGHTS, AND THEY ALWAYS BEGIN WITH, "MY HUSBAND WOULDN'T DO THAT TO ME." - I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. - DON'T TELL ME YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL! - ( phone rings ) - IF YOU FELT WHAT I FEEL, YOU'D BE SCREAMING. - Woman: CAN I HELP YOU? - Woman #2: Dr. Selky? - OFFICER. - I would just like to ask - just what she expected... - WE MAY HAVE HAD OUR PROBLEMS... - ...letting a little boy... - ...BUT WE ARE NOT CRAZY... - ...walk by himself. - ...AND WE DID NOT SEPARATE TO HURT EACH OTHER. WE SEPARATED IN ORDER TO STOP HURTING EACH OTHER. YOU SEE THAT? WOULD YOU GET THE NAME OF THAT IDIOT? Man: GET THE HELL OUT OF MY WAY! I'M HIS FATHER! Woman: CAN I HAVE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS? - SUSAN? - ( dial tone ) MR. SELKY, I'M LIEUTENANT MENETTI. COULD YOU PLEASE TELL ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU'VE BEEN FOR THE LAST-- - WOULD YOU GET THIS OUT OF HERE? - COME ON, LET'S GO. - PLEASE TAKE THEM OUT OF HERE. - COME ON, LET'S GO. - I HEARD IT ON THE RADIO. - DR. SELKY, THIS IS NOT IDLE CURIOSITY. I WANNA KNOW, AND I WANNA KNOW RIGHT NOW. - I WAS WITH A FRIEND. - WHAT? I WAS WITH A FRIEND. SINCE THIS MORNING, YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING? - ( whispers ) - GIVE ME THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF YOUR FRIEND. CAN YOU GIVE ME THE NAME AND THE ADDRESS OF YOUR FRIEND? LOOK, I HAD A HALF A DOZEN MEN OUT LOOKING FOR YOU FOR SIX HOURS. NOW WOULD YOU PLEASE GIVE ME THE NAME AND ADDRESS? LOOKING FOR ME? NOW WHAT KIND OF SENSE DOES THAT MAKE? THEY THOUGHT YOU TOOK HIM. YOU LEFT YOUR APARTMENT AT 7:00. YOU TAUGHT YOUR LAST LECTURE AT 12:00. NOBODY HAS SEEN YOU SINCE. NOW PLEASE GIVE ME THE NAME AND THE ADDRESS OF YOUR FRIEND. I WANT TO TALK TO HIM. STEPHANIE WILEY. WHAT WAS THAT? STEPHANIE WILEY. I'M HER THESIS ADVISOR. WE WENT TO HER PLACE FOR COFFEE. - Al: WHAT'S HER PHONE NUMBER? - IT'S LISTED. UNIVERSITY PLACE. - SHIT. - ( paper rustles, tears ) GET SOMEBODY TO CHECK OUT THIS STEPHANIE WILEY. I WANT A BANK OF PHONES-- THREE PHONES, TAPE RECORDER, HOOKUPS AND THE WORKS. AND A TABLE. SERGEANT ROCCO, CALL BOROUGH. SEE IF THEY'LL LET ME HAVE THE TASK FORCE. I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AROUND THIS NEIGHBORHOOD FOR MYSELF. - LET ME COME WITH YOU. - Al: NO. - ME TOO. - NO, I NEED ONE OF YOU HERE NEAR THE PHONE IN CASE THERE'S A RANSOM CALL. - I WANT EVERYBODY OUT ON THE STREET TONIGHT. - RIGHT. ( sighs ) ( whispers ) CHRIST. ( car honks ) Woman over radio: R.M.P., 20-89. Central. R.M.P., 20-89, K. Bellevue reports male John Doe with a knife wound, approximately 4'10", 105 lbs. TRY 50 LBS. WE'RE LOOKING FOR A SIX-YEAR-OLD. Keep trying. 10-4. - GRAHAM? - MM-HMM. YOU KNOW HOW WHEN HE FOLLOWS YOU INTO THE BATHROOM, PESTERS YOU, YOU THINK, "PLEASE, GOD, GIVE ME 10 MINUTES ALONE"? DO YOU THINK YOU COULD BE PUNISHED FOR THAT? ( clacking ) ( clacking continues ) - ( phone rings ) - Man: HELLO. NO, NO. NO NEW DEVELOPMENTS. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. THE CHILD WAS SEEN AT 8:30 THIS MORNING-- - NO, I MEAN YESTERDAY MORNING. - ( phone rings ) YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. - WEARING ONE BLUE COAT. - HELLO. WELL, AT LEAST WE'RE GETTING THE LIGHT BACK. NOW WE CAN START TO DO SOMETHING. Graham: IT'S NOT GONNA BE RANSOM. THEY'D HAVE CALLED BY NOW. HE'S BEEN TAKEN BY SOMEBODY WHO WANTS A KID, OR... HE'S BEEN KILLED. ( phone rings ) - HELLO. - Man: Hello, Al. Have you heard anything? - NO. - No ransom demand? - NOTHING. - Captain needs your report. He's been getting calls. - I'LL BE IN IN A LITTLE WHILE. - Okay, I'll see you later. - I'M GOING BACK TO PRECINCT TO GET CLEANED UP. - ALL RIGHT. UH. I'LL BE BACK HERE BEFORE-- BEFORE IT GETS NUTS AGAIN. ( door closes ) Man: ALL RIGHT, YOU COVER THAT APARTMENT. - YOU TAKE THIS SIDE OF THE STREET. - ( police radio chatter ) YOU WALK OFF AND-- MORNING, AL. - HI, SANDY. - HOW'S THE MOTHER? WELL, SHE'S GOOD, SURPRISINGLY. I MEAN, SHE HASN'T FALLEN APART YET. MY WIFE SAW HER ON THE NEWS LAST NIGHT. SHE SAID SHE WAS SO CALM, SHE WAS ALMOST TOO CALM. CALM, HUH? THAT'S WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE, CALM? YEAH, RIGHT, "THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WEIRD ABOUT THESE PEOPLE. THEY MUST DESERVE IT. IT CAN HAPPEN TO THEM. IT CAN'T HAPPEN TO ME." - HUH. - YOU KNOW SOMETHING? MY SON IS ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME AGE AS ALEX. LOOK, I GOT A HYPNOTIST COMING AT 11:00. YOU'LL HAVE TWO HELICOPTERS AND A COUPLE HUNDRED ON FOOT. - OKAY? - YEAH, THANKS. ( engine starts ) I MADE A MISTAKE LAST NIGHT. YOU KNOW THAT? I PUT A LOT OF MEN ON FINDING THE FATHER. THE MOTHER SWORE IT COULDN'T BE CUSTODY. I SHOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THAT. I SHOULD'VE HAD BLOODHOUNDS. I SHOULD'VE HIT THE 6:00 NEWS. STATE POLICE WOULDN'T GIVE YOU DOGS, ANYWAY, WITH THE FATHER OUT. WHAT ABOUT THE COMPUTER CHECK? ANY CHILD MOLESTERS? - NO. - NOBODY WITH A SHEET IN THE AREA? - NOTHING NEAR. - JESUS. I JUST HOPE WE DON'T HAVE SOME WACKO KID-KILLER HERE. I FEEL LIKE HAMMERED SHIT. - AL. - I'LL SEE YOU AT 9:30. ( sobbing ) WE'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE SELKY HOME HERE ON REMSEN STREET. THE SELKYS ARE INSIDE, AND AS FAR AS WE KNOW, THEY HAVE MADE NO STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS. - ( engine starts ) - LIEUTENANT MENETTI IS INSIDE. - Man: THERE! - RIGHT NOW THEY'RE COMING OUT-- ( reporters shouting ) ( chattering ) ( chattering stops ) ( clears throat ) GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING. I GUESS WE FEEL AT A TIME LIKE THIS THAT... WE NEED ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY? JUST "THANK YOU." I KNOW YOU ALL HAVE QUESTIONS. THIS IS DETECTIVE MENETTI, WHO'S HANDLING THE CASE, AND HE CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS MUCH BETTER THAN WE CAN. YES. THANK YOU FOR COMING. FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT WE'VE NEVER HAD A CHILD THIS YOUNG DISAPPEAR WITHOUT A TRACE. 95% OF THE TIME, WE HAVE A CLEAR RESOLUTION WITHIN 24 HOURS. NOW WE'RE TAKING THIS CASE VERY SERIOUSLY, AND WE WILL FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ALEX SELKY. - ( crowd speaks ) - DOES THAT MEAN YOU HAVE A LEAD? YES, WE HAVE SEVERAL LEADS WHICH COULD TURN UP SOMETHING VERY QUICKLY - ( crowd speaks ) - WELL, WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES WHO PLACE THE BOY ON MONTAGUE STREET YESTERDAY MORNING. WELL, WHAT WAS HE DOING ON MONTAGUE STREET? - HAVE YOU CALLED THE F.B.I.? - WE CANNOT CALL THE F.B.I., BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE OF A CRIME, LET ALONE INTERSTATE. I THOUGHT KIDNAPPING WAS A FEDERAL OFFENSE SINCE THE LINDBERGH BABY? WE DO NOT KNOW THAT WE HAVE A KIDNAPPING AS YET. - ( crowd speaks ) - WHAT WE KNOW IS A CHILD IS MISSING. - IT'S NOT A CRIME. - Woman: LIEUTENANT MENETTI, ALEX IS SIX YEARS OLD. HE DIDN'T DISAPPEAR BY HIMSELF. THAT'S RIGHT. I AGREE WITH YOU. WHEN WE HAVE A CHILD WHO IS UNDER SEVEN, WE ASSUME THAT HE DID NOT DISAPPEAR VOLUNTARILY. - WELL, YEAH. - YOU MEAN IF HE'D BEEN TWO MONTHS OLDER, YOU'D TELL US HE RAN AWAY? WELL, SEVEN IS CONSIDERED THE AGE OF DISCRETION. - ( crowd speaks ) - BUT WE FOLLOW EACH CASE INDIVIDUALLY. DETECTIVE MENETTI, ARE THE POLICE CONSIDERING OFFERING A REWARD? - 'CAUSE IF SO, I'M SURE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE... - NO, NO, NO. - ...WHO WOULD WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THAT. - NO, NOT AT THIS TIME. ( crowd speaking ) NO, NO, NOT AS YET. WE HAVE HAD NO REQUEST FOR A RANSOM. NOW TO OFFER A REWARD AT THIS TIME COULD CAUSE MORE PROBLEMS THAN IT COULD SOLVE. NOW THE BEST WAY THAT YOU ALL CAN HELP IS TO DISTRIBUTE THESE POSTERS IN AS WIDE AN AREA AS POSSIBLE, AND THE OFFICERS ARE GONNA HAND OUT THE POSTERS TO YOU. AND IF YOU WILL, GET PERMISSION TO PUT 'EM INSIDE STORE WINDOWS SO THAT THEY WON'T BE DEFACED, AND IF YOU SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING THAT WOULD HELP, YOU CAN CALL THIS NUMBER, OR YOU CAN CALL ME DIRECTLY AT THE 85th PRECINCT. LIEUTENANT MENETTI. - ( helicopter hovering ) - ( people shouting ) ( man speaking over P.A.) AVIATION 1, THIS IS LIEUTENANT MENETTI. AVIATION 1, THIS IS LIEUTENANT MENETTI. DO YOU READ ME? Man #2: This is Aviation 1. I read you. Over. LISTEN, I WANT YOU TO COME IN LOW OVER THE PIER. IF HE'S BEEN OUT ALL NIGHT, HE'LL BE COLD. HE'LL BE HUDDLED UP SMALL, SO COME IN LOW. OVER. Sorry, I don't copy. Over. I SAID STAY IN LOW. OVER. - Right. 10-4. - 10-4. Susan: DID YOU MANAGE TO GET BUCKET TO EAT ANYTHING? Margaret: SURE, HE EVEN MADE A TRUCE WITH THE CAT. AND I TALKED TO YOUR MOTHER AGAIN. SHE COULDN'T GET THROUGH UP HERE. WHAT DID YOU SAY? I TOLD HER SHE WOULD BE PROUD OF YOU. ( phone rings ) YES? YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS, PLEASE. - HELLO, PHILIPPE. - HI. SO SWEET. YOU CAN'T AFFORD THESE. IT'S ALL RIGHT. I STOLE 'EM. DETECTIVE SACHS, THIS IS PHILIPPE, OUR FRIEND WHO CLEANS FOR US-- BUT NOT ON SATURDAYS. I FELT THIS COMPULSION TO WASH DISHES. WELL, YOU HAVE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THAT. - ( phone rings ) - MARGARET, WILL YOU TAKE THESE, - AND I'LL GET A VASE? - SURE. - HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN THE SELKYS? - ALMOST TWO YEARS. - AND YOU WORK AS A... - HOUSEBOY. I'M AN ACTOR, BUT I DO THIS BETWEEN JOBS. YOU'RE NAOMI, AREN'T YOU? WELL, I COULD SEE WHY GRAHAM'S FRIENDS LAUGH AT HIM WHEN THEY SEE ME. ...THAT YOU WORK FOR AND YOUR COMPLETE NAME AND ADDRESS. UMM... IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I COULD DO FOR YOU? THANK YOU, BUT I-- I DON'T THINK SO. AND I KNOW YOU'LL UNDERSTAND IF I ASK YOU PLEASE DON'T COME HERE. WE MAY HAVE SOMETHING. THERE'S BEEN A THIRD SIGHTING ON MONTAGUE STREET. LET ME KNOW AS SOON AS YOU DO, WILL YOU? ( distant barking ) - ( knocks softly ) - ( door opens ) ( whispering ) ARE YOU OKAY, DAD? - ( whispering ) HOW ARE YOU? - PRETTY GOOD. HI. IT'S THE AX MURDERER. I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE SO WELL-PROTECTED. HONEY, YOU LOOK LIKE SOMEBODY BEAT YOU UP. I KNOW. I FEEL LIKE IT. I JUST SAW YOU ON THE NEWS. OH, YOU DID, HUH? WHAT DID I SAY? WE SAW ABOUT 1,000 PEOPLE GOING ALL AROUND BROOKLYN, PUTTING UP POSTERS, AND THEN WE SAW YOU SAY THAT YOU HAD A NUMBER OF PROMISING LEADS AND WERE CONFIDENT OF AN EARLY SOLUTION. I SAID THAT, HUH? DID I SHOW EVERYONE THE HAIR ON MY CHEST TOO? HONEY. - DO YOU HAVE ANY LEADS? - OH, YEAH. NOT ONLY DO I HAVE LEADS. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. THE BOY WALKED DOWN HENRY STREET AT 9:00 A.M. ON A VERY BUSY DAY AND VANISHED INTO THIN AIR. THREE PSYCHICS SAY HE'S DEAD. ONE OF THEM SWEARS THAT HE'S IN A LARGE BOAT AT SEA. - ONE WOMAN CALLED FOUR TIMES TO SAY... - ( coins clattering ) SHIT. THAT HE'S IN TEL AVIV, KIDNAPPED BY THE ELDERS OF ZION. I DO HAVE THREE WITNESSES WHO SAY-- THEY SWORE THEY SAW HIM ON MONTAGUE STREET WITH SOME PIMPLY GUY IN LEATHERS. - SO YOU SAID. - STUCK TO IT UNDER HYPNOSIS TOO. TELL ME SOMETHING: IS THERE ANYTHING SOME GEEK MIGHT SAY TO EUGENE THAT WOULD GET HIM TO GET INTO HIS CAR WITHOUT A STRUGGLE? PROMISE TO TAKE HIM TO MEET THE REAL BATMAN? I HOPE YOU'RE KIDDING. I DON'T KNOW IF I AM OR NOT. NAH, PAT, HE'S A COP'S KID. WE'VE BEEN OVER IT WITH BOTH OF THEM A MILLION TIMES. AL, HE'S A KID, AND YOU CAN TELL HIM WHAT YOU CAN TELL HIM. HE'S STILL SEVEN YEARS OLD. SURE, I THINK ANY REASONABLY BRIGHT ADULT COULD GET EUGENE INTO A CAR. TELL HIM HE'S A COP AND YOU SENT FOR HIM. TELL HIM I'M SICK AND I NEED HIM. YOU KNOW, WE LET HIM WALK TO THE SCHOOL BUS BY HIMSELF. THE WORLD'S A DANGEROUS PLACE WHEN YOU'RE SEVEN AND WHEN YOU'RE 40, AND YOU CAN'T KEEP 'EM BABIES FOREVER. YEAH. SOONER OR LATER, YOU HAVE TO LET THEM GROW UP. I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING: THAT KID WAS A BEAUTIFUL KID. IF HE'S NOT DEAD BY NOW, IT MIGHT BE BETTER IF HE WAS. ( door opens ) - ( people chattering ) - WE WERE IN THE SHOE STORE AT ABOUT 12:30. I BOUGHT RICKY A PAIR OF COWBOY BOOTS. THEN WE WENT TO THE BURGER KING. TELL ME, MR. GARRETT, WHY WASN'T YOUR NEPHEW IN SCHOOL? HE GOES TO FRIENDS. THEY HAD THE DAY OFF-- FACULTY ENRICHMENT DAY. OH. WELL, I GUESS THAT'S EASY ENOUGH TO CHECK OUT. ( phone rings ) HELLO. DETECTIVE MENETTI. - Woman: You know the little lost boy? - YES. GO AHEAD, PLEASE. That you told us on the TV? - The man in 108. - YES, GO ON. The man in 108, he's got no family he's said a word about. Now all of a sudden, the same day as that lost boy, - he's got a grandson. - CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE YOU'RE CALLING FROM, PLEASE? Next door-- poof! --instant grandson. Do you think I believe it? He just wants to get my attention. - He wants to kiss me. - WHAT?

LET'S SEE IF WE CAN'T GET THIS ONE OVER WITH. - Man: YOU SIGN A WAIVER? - YES. Man: OKAY THEN. JUST RELAX, MRS. SELKY. UNCROSS YOUR LEGS.

DID YOU KILL YOUR SON, MRS. SELKY? NO. THANK YOU. ( elevator dings ) ( dings ) ( water running ) ( water stops ) ( people chatting ) ( breathing deeply ) I BELIEVE IN GOD, THE FATHER ALMIGHTY, CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH, AND IN JESUS CHRIST, HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON. I'M SORRY THAT TOOK SO LONG. FOR SOME REASON, I HAD TO BE TOLD ALL THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASPIRIN AND TYLENOL, NOT THAT IT MATTERS TO ME. JUSTINE WILL BE ON CHEWABLE ASPIRIN TILL SHE'S 30. HOW IS SHE? IS SHE SLEEPING? NOT REALLY. THESE POLICE ARE REALLY VERY HEAVY-HANDED. I MEAN, THEY ARRIVE AT THAT SCHOOL, AND THEY DRAG THOSE KIDS OUT OF CLASS-- THE SAME KIDS, THE SAME CLASS. THEY ASK THEM THE SAME QUESTIONS EVERY DAY. THEY ALL THINK THEY'RE ABOUT TO BE ARRESTED. JUSTINE'S HAVING NIGHTMARES. SHE THINKS IT'S ALL HER FAULT. - WHAT? - SHE THINKS IF SHE HADN'T SCREWED AROUND THAT MORNING TRYING TO FIND HER BARRETTES, THAT WE WOULD'VE BEEN ON THAT CORNER, AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED. IS THAT WHY SHE HASN'T BEEN TO SEE ME? COME ON. DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT JUSTINE. COME ON, STOP THAT. JUSTINE WILL BE FINE. YOU KNOW JUSTINE. SHE'S TOUGH AS NAILS. ( sighs ) THE POLICE-- I ALWAYS IMAGINED THAT THEY HAD THESE BIG COMPUTERS AND THINGS, AND INSTEAD THEY MARCH AROUND WITH THESE INDEX CARDS AND THESE STUBBY LITTLE PENCILS AND TALK ABOUT CALLING IN PSYCHICS. WE'RE SEEING A PSYCHIC ON THURSDAY. LISTEN. LAST NIGHT, WE GOT THREE PHONE CALLS RIGHT IN A ROW. THE FIRST ONE SAID SHE'S HAD A VISION OF ALEX IN A BLUE CAR-- AN OLD BLUE CAR. ONE MINUTE LATER, SOMEBODY ELSE CALLS UP, TALKS ABOUT A BLUE CAR. 15 MINUTES AFTER THAT, SOMEBODY CALLS UP, DESCRIBES AN OLD BLUE CAR, WITH A CHILD HE FEELS SURE IS ALEX LYING IN THE BACK SEAT OF THE CAR. AND THEN I REMEMBERED THERE WAS A CAR THAT DROVE PAST THE HOUSE THE MORNING THAT ALEX DISAPPEARED-- AN OLD BLUE CAR. MY GOD, THAT'S AMAZING. SO WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH THIS WOMAN. SHE'S HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH MENETTI BEFORE. I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, MAYBE IT'S LIKE ANIMALS. MAYBE, YOU KNOW, THEY SMELL AND SEE THINGS THAT WE DON'T SMELL AND SEE. MAYBE THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE THAT. MAYBE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THINGS WE DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE RIGHT. I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT. YOU'RE RIGHT. OH, LOOK, I JUST HAVE TO DROP THIS STUFF OFF. CAN YOU WAIT? - NO. WILL YOU CALL ME TONIGHT? - YEAH. SURE. TAKE CARE. - THANK YOU. - SEE YOU SOON. Woman: THIS CHILD LIKES TRUCKS. NO, HE DOESN'T REALLY. IT'S JUST THAT HIS UNCLE KEEPS GIVING THEM TO HIM. IT'S RAINING OUTSIDE. IT'S... DARK. HE'S CRYING... VERY HARD. QUIETLY. HE'S... ASLEEP. VERY STILL. MMM. THIS PEN-- THIS PEN IS DRIED UP. ( chuckling ) I SMELL LEATHER. BOOTS-- NO, A SADDLE. IT'S... BLUE UPHOLSTERY. IT'S A CAR. THE CHILD IS LYING... IN THE BACK SEAT VERY STILL. WE'RE PASSING A HIGHWAY. SIX LANES. IT'S... GRAY. IT'S BLUE! THE CAR IS BLUE. CAN YOU SEE THE LICENSE PLATE? NO. I'M INSIDE. CAN YOU MAKE OUT THE DRIVER? NO, I-- I SEE A SIGN. "CHARTER... OAK... BRIDGE." WE'RE SLOWING DOWN. WE'RE STOPPING. WE'RE AT A TOLLBOOTH. IS THE CHILD ALEX? PLEASE... TRY AGAIN FOR THE DRIVER. IS IT ALEX? IS HE ALIVE? CHARTER OAK BRIDGE-- I MEAN, THAT'S-- THAT'S TWO MILES FROM MY PARENTS' PLACE. YOU KNOW THIS PLACE? YEAH, IT'S JUST OUTSIDE HARTFORD. IT'S TWO MILES FROM MY PARENTS! - GOOD, WE'LL PUT OUT A CALL TO CONNECTICUT. - NO, LET'S GO UP THERE. - WE CAN BE THERE IN TWO HOURS. - YEAH, YEAH, BUT LET'S LET THE HIGHWAY PATROL DO IT. I'LL PUT OUT AN A.P.B. IT'LL COVER THE TRI-STATE AREA. COULD I HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE? YOU CAN HAVE WHATEVER YOU WANT. ( all chuckle ) - YEAH, WELL, YOU GROPE FOR STRAWS AFTER AWHILE. - ( phone rings ) Man: HELLO. LIEUTENANT MENETTI, IT'S THE PRECINCT FOR YOU. I REALLY THINK MY MOTHER'S IN SHOCK. YESTERDAY ON THE PHONE SHE STARTED THIS CHATTER ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT SHE WAS GONNA ENTER A GOLF TOURNAMENT THIS SUMMER AT HER CLUB. IT'S LIKE SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED. SHE JUST DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO TALK TO YOU. - ( footsteps approach ) - YES, I KNOW. ( knocks ) I JUST GOT A CALL FROM THE PRECINCT. CONNECTICUT POLICE REPORTED ONE TOLL-TAKER CAME ON AT 9:00, SAID SHE SAW-- SHE THOUGHT SHE SAW A CAR WITH A BOY LAST WEEK. LOOKS LIKE NOTHING. WELL, WE'LL HAVE HER HYPNOTIZED. MAYBE SHE CAN COME UP WITH A LICENSE PLATE OR... LOOK, I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW MORNING. GOOD NIGHT. I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS VERY SLOW. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU SOME PICTURES. JUST TELL ME IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN ANY OF THESE MEN BEFORE. ( phone ringing ) HELLO. NO, HE'S NOT HERE. - MAY I TAKE A MESSAGE? - ( receiver clatters ) WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR? THE GUY'S NAME IS NEIL MOONEY. DOES THAT RING A BELL? HAD A NUMBER OF ARRESTS, BUT ONLY ONE CONVICTION. WHAT WAS THE CONVICTION FOR? WELL, HE WAS A DENTIST, HAD HIS LICENSE LIFTED. HE WAS USING THE ETHER AND MOLESTING KIDS, PROBABLY FOR YEARS, UNTIL HE HURT ONE ENOUGH TO GET CAUGHT. HOW DOES SOMEBODY GET AWAY WITH THAT FOR YEARS? WELL, THINK OF THE WOMEN THAT DON'T REPORT RAPE. - ( phone rings ) - THINK OF WHAT IT TAKES FOR A KID TO BLOW THE WHISTLE ON A GROWN-UP. EVEN IF THEY DO, THE PARENTS DON'T BELIEVE 'EM, OR ELSE THEY WON'T LET 'EM TESTIFY. ANYWAY, FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS, HE'S INVOLVED IN THIS CHICKEN PORN RING, - AND TWO WEEKS AGO WE GOT A CALL-- - Graham: WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT IS THAT, CHICKEN PORN? WELL, YOU KNOW, DIRTY PICTURES OF KIDS. THEY SELL THEM UNDERGROUND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. WHAT DO THEY DO WITH THE CHILDREN? WELL, SOMETIMES THEY SELL THEM TOO, BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE GUY. WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY, MOONEY? OH, WE DON'T KNOW. IF WE DID, HE'D BE IN JAIL. LOOK, HIS WIFE JUST REPORTED THAT HE DISAPPEARED THE DAY BEFORE ALEX DID. WAIT A MINUTE. HE'S BEEN GONE TWO WEEKS, HIS WIFE JUST REPORTED HIM MISSING? NO, SHE DIDN'T REPORT HIM MISSING. SHE ACCUSES HIM OF STEALING A CAR, A BLUE '65 CADILLAC. DOES HE LIVE NEAR HERE? 15 BLOCKS. SUSAN! - WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - I'M JUST PUTTING OUT ALEX'S SUMMER CLOTHES. - WHAT IS IT? - OH, THERE'S SOMEONE ON THE PHONE. MENETTI THINKS YOU SHOULD TAKE IT. ( people chattering ) AL, WHAT IS IT? IT'S SOME WOMAN FROM THAT TV SHOW "STRAIGHT TALK." NOW BEFORE YOU TAKE IT, I HAVE TO TELL YOU THERE'S ANOTHER CHILD THAT'S BEEN MISSING SINCE YESTERDAY EVENING. NOW THEY WANT YOU TO DO A SEGMENT WITH THE SECOND MOTHER TOMORROW MORNING. IT'S A LITTLE GIRL, FIVE I THINK. THEY'LL SHOW PICTURES OF BOTH KIDS. - HELLO? - Woman: Is this Mrs. Susan Selky? - YES, IT IS. - I'm Mary Parks from "Straight Talk." - LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD PLEASE. - OH, I'M SORRY. - WHAT COLOR LIPSTICK DO YOU USE? - I DON'T USE ANY. - A LITTLE HIGHLIGHTER HERE. - IS THIS OKAY? - PERFECT. COULD YOU LOOK UP, PLEASE? - WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COFFEE? - NO, THANK YOU. - HOW ABOUT YOU? - ( man speaking over TV ) - YOU SURE? HOW ABOUT YOU, DR. SOREL? COFFEE? - Sorel: YES, PLEASE. - NOW SUCK IN THOSE CHEEKS FOR ME. LIKE-- LIKE THIS. HMM. GOOD. I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE TO TAKE YOU TO THE GREEN ROOM. OF COURSE IT'S NOT REALLY GREEN. OH, THE PRODUCER WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU BROUGHT THE PICTURES. THAT'S FINE. I'LL GIVE IT TO THE FLOOR MANAGER. BE RIGHT BACK. I HEARD 'EM SAY "GREEN ROOM" ON THE JOHNNY CARSON SHOW. UH, MRS. SMITH? CAN WE STEP OUTSIDE FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE? SANDRA'S ALL RIGHT, ISN'T SHE? I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER IF WE WENT OUTSIDE. MRS. SMITH, SANDRA WAS FOUND AN HOUR AGO. APPARENTLY SHE FELL IN A CISTERN ON BRIDGE STREET. WELL, SHE'S ALL RIGHT, ISN'T SHE? NO. I'M SORRY. SHE'S DEAD. COME OUTSIDE. ( sobbing ) MRS. SELKY, WE CAN SWITCH THE ORDER OF THE SEGMENTS. - WE'LL PUT DR. SOREL ON NEXT IF YOU'RE NOT-- - SURE. - NO. - CAN I GET YOU SOME WATER? NO, THANK YOU. DO YOU WANT TO GO ON IN TWO MINUTES? HAVE YOU EVER DONE LIVE TV BEFORE? I'LL BE FINE. OKAY. MRS. SELKY, YOU'RE MORE UPSET THAN YOU THINK. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS, YOU KNOW. - YES, I DO. - I MEAN, THEY CAN FILL IN THE SEGMENT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL OBLIGED TO GO ON TV. MY SON IS ALIVE AND I DO THIS, THEN THERE'S A CHANCE THAT SOMEBODY WHO WATCHES IT WILL RECOGNIZE HIM AND CONTACT US. AND IF I DON'T, THERE ISN'T. OH. WELL, IT'S VERY SIMPLE, ISN'T IT? YES, IT IS. ( classical piano music playing ) Graham: WAIT A MINUTE. THAT'S NOT TRUE. THE NEWSPAPERS ARE BOUND TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF ALEX'S BIRTHDAY. SHE'S GONNA NEED SOMEBODY HERE. Al: IF SHE DOES, WE'LL SEND SOMEONE OVER. IN THE MEANTIME, JUST TAPE ALL YOUR CALLS. WE'LL FOLLOW UP ALL THE LEADS YOU GET. NOTHING'S CHANGED. I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO RUN THIS CASE FROM THE PRECINCT. - THAT'S ALL. - Graham: NOTHING HAS CHANGED? BALONEY! YOU'RE CUTTING US OFF BECAUSE A SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY ISN'T IN YOUR GODDAMN BUDGET! Al: CHRIST! IT'S NOT MY BUDGET! AND I'M NOT CUTTING YOU OFF! I FEEL LIKE I LOST MY OWN KID. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? THERE'S A DOZEN THINGS HANGING FIRE. WHAT ABOUT THE BLUE CAR? WHAT ABOUT NEIL MOONEY? GRAHAM, WE'RE NOT CLOSING THE CASE. I CAN'T KEEP MEN UP HERE FOR SIX WEEKS. WELL, I CAN'T TAKE IT! YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?! I CAN'T TAKE IT! I'LL TALK TO SOMEBODY AT BOROUGH. SUSAN. LOOK, I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW MORNING. ( phone ringing ) HELLO. YEAH, JUST A MINUTE. IT'S COLUMBIA. IT'S THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT. DR. SELKY CAN'T COME TO THE PHONE RIGHT NOW. I'LL GIVE HER THE MESSAGE. YEAH. THEY-- THEY WANT YOU TO CALL THEM BACK FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING. ( music stops ) ( silence ) ( kids playing ) Man: THEY SWITCHED THE DUTY ROSTER. I'VE GOT TO WORK THE HOLIDAYS. - Man #2: YOU GOTTA WORK THE HOLIDAY? - Man: MY GIRLFRIEND HAD A FIT. ALL I'M GONNA SAY IS JUST COME DOWN HARD ON HIM. CALL THE FAMILY. THEY SAY HE'S IN SOUTH CAROLINA. I THINK THE SCHMUCK'S RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK. ALL RIGHT? HIT THE BROTHER. I THINK HE'LL PROBABLY TELL YOU. - THIS GUY, YOU KNOW HIM? - Sachs: OH, YEAH. - THIS IS WHAT'S-HIS-FACE. - Al: YEAH, GOOD OL' WHAT'S-HIS-FACE. I'M A BLANK, AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON DOWNTOWN. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE PHONE NUMBER OR ANYTHING IS RIGHT NOW. - Sachs: DR. SELKY. - OH, HI, SUSAN. - YOU KNOW SACHS. - SURE I DO. HOW YOU DOING? - NICE TO SEE YOU. - HOW ARE YOU? - I'M GOOD. HAVE A SEAT? - YES, PLEASE, GO AHEAD. I JUST THOUGHT I'D COME ROUND AND TELL YOU THERE WAS A VOLUNTEER MEETING - AT 6:00 AT THE SCHOOL. - GOOD. - SORRY, DETECTIVE, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD-- - OH, SURE. - THANKS. - THANK YOU. YEAH? SO WHAT'S UP? SOMETHING HAPPEN? - ( phone rings ) - Man: HELLO. I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN DAYS, AL. WELL, LOOK, JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ME, - DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT ON THE CASE, YOU KNOW. - HOW DO I KNOW? WHEN IT WAS FRONT-PAGE NEWS, I HAD 100 PEOPLE IN MY HOUSE. TWO MONTHS LATER, I'M LUCKY IF YOU STOP BY ONCE A WEEK. I NEED TO BE KEPT INFORMED, AL. I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. LIKE TODAY. RIGHT NOW, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TODAY? TODAY, RIGHT NOW, I'M LOOKING FOR THIS MAN. HE ROBBED A LIQUOR STORE THIS MORNING. HE SHOT THE OWNER IN COLD BLOOD IN THE FACE. THE OWNER IS 80 YEARS OLD, AND I GOT EYEWITNESSES AND A TRAIL AS HOT AS A PISTOL, AND I'M GONNA FIND THIS ANIMAL. THAT DOESN'T MEAN I WANT TO FIND ALEX ANY LESS. IT JUST MEANS THAT THE TRAIL ISN'T HOT AS A PISTOL. WELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE. - WHY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - I THINK I MAY HAVE SOMETHING. - WHAT? - WELL, IT MIGHT NOT PAN OUT, BUT WE PICKED UP THIS GUY YESTERDAY, HE WAS A CELLMATE OF NEIL MOONEY'S IN ATTICA. - WHAT'D HE SAY? - HE SAID HE MIGHT KNOW WHERE NEIL MOONEY IS. - IN FACT, HE GAVE US A LEAD. - AL. - WHAT KIND OF A LEAD? - ALL RIGHT, JUST A SECOND. HI, MENETTI. - AL, WHAT KIND OF A LEAD? - YEAH, JUST HOLD ON A MINUTE. LOOK, I'M SORRY, BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE THIS OTHER CALL. HOW SOON CAN YOU FIND OUT ABOUT MOONEY? I'LL SEE YOU AT THE MEETING. - YOU WILL? - YEAH, I WILL. YEAH, GO AHEAD. I'M HERE. RIGHT. - AL? - WHAT'D THE WHOLE PACKAGE LOOK LIKE? 6:00, THE SCHOOL. YEAH, BUT WHAT'S THE RECORD OF CONVICTIONS? - ( people chattering ) - GO BACK TO FILES. - JUST LIKE THEY HAVE NO MEMORY OF IT ANYMORE. - ( speaks softly ) - WHAT? WHAT? - EXCUSE ME. MENETTI SAID HE'D COME LATER. UH, I GUESS WE HAVE OUR QUORUM. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING. WE INVITED THE PRESS, BUT THEY SAID THEY'D PASS. NO NEWS IS NO NEWS. I KNOW YOU ALL HAVE THINGS TO DO, SO I WON'T TAKE ANY MORE TIME. THE SITUATION IS, PEOPLE DON'T HEAR ANYTHING NEW, THEY ASSUME THE STORY'S OVER. SO MURIEL'S PRINTED NEW POSTERS-- AT COST, FOR WHICH WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL. AT WHAT COST? CAN I PITCH IN ON IT? - YES, WE ALL WOULD. - YES. THANK YOU. WE COULD USE IT. WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO TODAY IS IF EACH OF YOU COULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DISTRIBUTING THE POSTERS TO DIFFERENT AREAS. Woman: WHY DON'T I START AROUND PARK SLOPE? - I HAVE TO GO THERE ANYWAYS. - ( all speaking ) MARK, COULD YOU JUST MAKE A NOTE OF WHO'S GOING TO WHAT AREA SO WE DON'T DOUBLE COVER? I'LL BE BACK. ( whispers ) - Susan: WHAT IS IT? - MY OFFICE JUST RADIOED. THEY PICKED UP NEIL MOONEY AN HOUR AGO IN PHILADELPHIA. - Graham: AND? - ( sighs ) HE'S ALONE, AND HE'S GOT THE BEST ALIBI YET. WHEN ALEX DISAPPEARED, HE WAS IN THE DRUNK TANK IN METUCHEN, NEW JERSEY. ( sighs ) THAT'S IT? THERE'S NO CONNECTION? WELL, WE'LL BRING HIM BACK, TAKE HIS BRAINS APART, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE NO, NO CONNECTION. HE CAN ACCOUNT FOR HIS TIME. ( people chattering ) ( whispering ) YOU CAN'T LET EVERY SETBACK HIT YOU THIS HARD. ( whispering ) I DON'T LET EVERY SETBACK HIT ME THIS HARD. I THOUGHT IT WAS MOONEY. EVERYTHING POINTED TO HIM. AL THOUGHT SO TOO. I'M ALLOWED TO DROP EVERY NOW AND THEN. WE COULD HAVE FOUND MOONEY AND HEARD SOMETHING A LOT WORSE, YOU KNOW. I KNOW THAT. DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT? I THINK YOU KNOW IT IN YOUR HEAD, BUT I DON'T SEE YOU DOING ANYTHING TO PREPARE YOURSELF FOR IT. YOU'RE NOT WITH ME. WHAT DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M PREPARED FOR? I KNOW I'M NOT WITH YOU NIGHT AND DAY, BUT I'M WITH YOU AN AWFUL LOT RIGHT NOW, AND, I MEAN, I SEE YOU PUT EVERYTHING INTO ANSWERING THE LETTERS AND DEALING WITH CRANKS AND WHAT THE POLICE ARE DOING. YES. OH, COME ON. PLEASE DON'T GET DEFENSIVE. I'M WITH YOU. I'M NOT ATTACKING YOU. WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS... THERE MAY COME A TIME THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CONSIDER - ACCEPTING-- - ACCEPTING WHAT, THAT IT'S TOO PAINFUL TO GO ON HOPING? THAT I SHOULD CUT HIM OFF TO SPARE MYSELF THE INCONVENIENCE OF MISSING HIM? LOOK, NOT OF MISSING HIM. WE'RE GONNA MISS HIM ALL OUR LIVES. TRYING TO SAVE HIM IF HE CAN'T BE SAVED. FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. FOR MY OWN GOOD? WHAT, AM I IN THIS BY MYSELF? OF COURSE NOT. I JUST MEAN-- SUSAN, YOU WORRY ME. I WORRY YOU? YOU'RE FINE, AND I'M CRAZY. THAT ONE AGAIN, EH? I AM NOT FINE, ALL RIGHT? I'M HANGING ON HERE BY MY-- AH, DAMN. MAYBE THE REASON THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH THIS THING SO WELL IS 'CAUSE YOU NEVER REALLY GAVE A DAMN IN THE FIRST PLACE, GRAHAM. YOU NEVER CARED ENOUGH TO STOP SCREWING AROUND AND SCREWING UP HIS HOME WHEN HE WAS WITH US, DID YOU? ( door shuts ) - ( door bangs ) - Pat: SO FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY, MARYANNE WANTS TO BRING THAT CHICKEN MOUSSE SHE MAKES-- MARCIA CALLS IT CHICKEN JELL-O-- BUT I JUST TOLD HER TO JUST DO SOME FRENCH BREAD PIZZA OR SOMETHING EASY. THEN AFTERWARDS WE'LL GO TO THE PARADE AND-- ( crickets chirping ) ( sighs ) HELLO, SAILOR. COME HERE OFTEN? - CHICKEN JELL-O? - OH, I'M SORRY. YOU DID NOT BEAT THE CLOCK. THE CLOCK BEAT YOU. THE CORRECT ANSWER WAS "PARADE." BUT LET'S HEAR IT FOR AL MENETTI, FATHER OF TWO, WHO'S ABOUT TO BE SUED FOR DIVORCE. - IT'S DELICIOUS. - ( sighs ) GREAT. NOBODY DOESN'T LIKE SARA LEE. LOOK, AL, WHILE I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION, DID YOU COMPUTE THAT EUGENE'S BEEN WETTING HIS BED AGAIN? HE HAS? WHEN DID THAT START? ABOUT A MONTH AGO. IT'S HAPPENED FOUR TIMES NOW. I THOUGHT HE WAS ALL OVER THAT. DID YOU TALK TO A DOCTOR? NOTHING'S WRONG WITH HIM, IS THERE? WHO KNOWS? DOCTORS DON'T KNOW. HE SAID WE SHOULD JUST BE PATIENT AND WAIT FOR HIM TO OUTGROW IT. WAIT? HOW LONG? ( distant barking ) AL, WHY DO I GET THE FEELING I'M TALKING TO MYSELF? - HUH? - OKAY, THAT'S IT. YOUR SON WETS HIS BED TO GET YOUR ATTENTION. - WHAT'LL WORK FOR ME? - I'M SORRY. WE HAD TO DRAG THE EAST RIVER FOR THE SELKY KID TODAY. OH. ( hopefully ) YOU DIDN'T FIND HIM? I DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH ME. SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH MY NOSE ON THIS ONE. I WAS SO SURE I WAS WRONG LOOKING FOR THAT FATHER THE FIRST NIGHT. THEN I GO THE OTHER WAY, AND NOW AFTER THREE MONTHS, I'M UP TO MY ARMPITS IN PSYCHICS AND GYPSIES AND JESUS KNOWS WHAT ALL. I'M GETTING NOWHERE. - ( clatters ) - OH, SHIT. - LET ME TAKE THAT. - I GOT IT. I GOT IT. I GOT IT. LET EUGENE THINK IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY. ( sighs ) - PAT. - WHAT? IF WE GO BACK TO SQUARE ONE AND I SAY, "OKAY, A KID IS MISSING-- NO STRUGGLE, NO TRACE," WHO DO I LOOK FOR? WHO? SOMEONE HE KNEW. ( kids playing ) OH, LOOK AT YOU! - OH, DON'T YOU LOOK PRETTY. - THANK YOU. OH, IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU. - YOU ALL RIGHT? - YEAH. I'LL SEE YOU LATER THEN. - OKAY. BYE. - BYE-BYE. - ( Jocelyn laughing ) - YOU LOST WEIGHT! AGAIN. HI. HOW ARE YOU? YOU LOOK WONDERFUL. I KNOW. YOU'RE SO SKINNY. I CAN'T STAND IT. NO, NO. IT'S DIVORCE FAT. ( laughs ) - JUSTINE LOOKS GOOD. - YEAH, DOESN'T SHE? SHE'S GONNA VISIT HER FATHER NEXT WEEKEND. OH, YEAH? HOW'S THAT? IT'S FINE. IT'S REALLY FINE. YEAH. HE'S GOT A NEW GIRLFRIEND. SHE'S 22. ( silent ) SHE THINKS HE INVENTED THE WHEEL. - WHO, GEORGE? - ( laughing ) YES. YOU'RE TAKING THIS AWFULLY WELL, JOCELYN. OH, NOT REALLY. I'VE MISSED YOU. HOW ARE YOU? - I'M OKAY. - YEAH? WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING? I'VE FINISHED THAT WILLA CATHER ARTICLE WHICH I SPENT HALF MY LIFE WRITING. RIGHT. I WENT AND JOINED A GROUP CALLED PARENTS REMEMBER. - YEAH? - AND, OH... I HAD A-- I HAD A... BAD FIGHT WITH GRAHAM. - OH, WHAT ABOUT? - I THINK NERVES. I DON'T-- NOTHING. - AND , UH-- - EVERYTHING. YES. YEAH, EVERYTHING. SO I JUST-- I WENT FOR HIM, YOU KNOW? AND I DO THAT. I JUST GO FOR PEOPLE. AND I WENT FOR HIM. - I GOT HIM. - ( laughs ) - AND... - ( sighs ) I SAY THINGS, YOU KNOW, WHEN I'M LIKE THAT THAT DON'T HAVE TO BE TRUE. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE ANYTHING. THEY JUST HAVE TO HURT. RIGHT. I KNOW. WELL, I WOULDN'T KNOCK YOURSELF OUT ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW. I MEAN, GRAHAM DOES HOLD UP HIS END. HE WAS A GOOD HUSBAND, YOU KNOW. EXCEPT FOR THE LAST YEAR OR TWO, HE WAS A GOOD HUSBAND. HE WAS-- HE WAS KIND. HE WAS F-- OH, FUNNY, BUT WITH TERRIBLE JOKES. ( whispers ) HE WAS SEXY. AND HE WAS A GOOD FATHER, MAYBE THE BEST I'VE SEEN. IT'S JUST THAT WHEN MY BOOK CAME OUT, PEOPLE MADE SUCH A FUSS OVER ME-- INTELLIGENT WOMAN, RIGHT? --AND HIS BOOK WASN'T PUBLISHED. AND SO HE BECAME VERY DISAPPOINTED IN HIMSELF. I DIDN'T KNOW IT. AND WHEN HE STARTED TO SLEEP AROUND IN THAT LAST YEAR... I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS BECAUSE HE HAD LOST CONFIDENCE IN HIMSELF, AND SO I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T GIVE TO HIM WHAT HE NEEDED, AND I SHOULD'VE. AND... SO. IT HAPPENS. ( classical piano music playing ) ( siren approaching ) ( dog barking ) WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S WRONG? HE GOT SOME KIND OF A RANSOM CALL. HE WALKED INTO A BACK ALLEY WITH $10,000. THEY BEAT HIM UP. WE TRIED TO TAKE HIM TO THE HOSPITAL, BUT HE SAID NO. COME ON, LET'S GET YOU TO THE HOSPITAL. SUSAN, JUST LISTEN-- JUST LISTEN TO ME. THIS WOMAN CALLED ME. SHE SAID SHE HAD ALEX, BUT HE WAS SICK. SO SHE'D SELL HIM TO ME. I SAID I HAD TO SPEAK TO HIM. I HEARD THIS LITTLE VOICE SAY... "HELLO, DADDY." THAT'S ALL SHE LET-- I TOLD HER THAT WASN'T ENOUGH. WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL THE POLICE? SHE SAID HER BOYFRIEND WAS ON THE FORCE, IF I DIDN'T COME ALONE, SHE'D KNOW. SHE SAID HE HAD A FEVER... AND IF I DIDN'T COME, SHE'D LET HIM DIE. MY FATHER GAVE ME $5,000. I THINK WE'VE GOTTA GET HIM IN THE CAR. COME ON, HONEY. - WE'LL GET YOU SOME HELP NOW. - ( muttering ) COME ON, BABY. I JUST WANTED SO MUCH TO BRING HIM BACK TO YOU. YES, BABY, I KNOW. COME ON. COME ON. - ( engine starts ) - PUT YOUR HEAD BACK. GIVE ME YOUR HAND. YOU'LL BE OKAY. - ( door shuts ) - ( siren blaring ) - Graham: WHAT HE TELL YOU? - THAT THE INTERNAL INJURIES ARE SLIGHT AND THAT THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO FOR CRACKED RIBS EXCEPT KEEP STILL. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO WEAR THAT FOR ANOTHER COUPLE OF WEEKS. HOW DO YOU FEEL? FINE, AS LONG AS I DON'T MOVE OR LAUGH, BREATHE. HAVE YOU HEARD THE ONE ABOUT THE OLD MAN? ( stifling laughter ) GUY GOES TO THE DOCTOR, HE SAYS TO THE DOCTOR, "DOC, I'M REALLY HAVING TROUBLE PEEING. I MEAN, I'M NOT PEEING. I'VE JUST STOPPED PEEING." DOCTOR SAYS TO HIM, "WELL, HOW OLD ARE YOU?" HE SAYS, "I'M 86." - DOCTOR SAYS, "WELL, YOU'VE PEED ENOUGH." - ( pained laughter ) I'M SORRY. THAT WAS A DIRTY TRICK. I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. YOU LOOK SO FUNNY, TRYING TO LAUGH. I'M SORRY. ( people chattering ) ( chattering ) - ( phone ringing ) - I'LL GET IT! - HELLO? - Sandy: Hi. Can I speak to your dad please? OKAY, JUST A SECOND. - DADDY, IT'S FOR YOU! - OKAY. HOLD ON. HEY, HONEY, - WOULD YOU-- WOULD YOU-- - ( chattering ) - HELLO. - Al, it's Sandy. - YEAH? - Look, we just arrested Sullivan. He picked up a 14-year-old male prostitute, and when our guy busted in, he was using a whip on him. WOW. HE FINALLY GOT TIRED OF KEEPING HIS NOSE CLEAN, HUH? We got a warrant to search his apartment. We've got whips, handcuffs, knives. - WHAT? - And he had a little kid's underpants covered with blood in his pocket... - HOLY-- - ...with a name tape-- Alex Selky. OH, MY GOD. OH, G-- UMM, - HAS THE PRESS GOT IT YET? - No, I don't think so. SANDY, DO ME A FAVOR. KEEP IT DOWN AS LONG AS YOU CAN. - I DON'T WANT THE MOTHER HEARING THIS ON THE RADIO. - Should I call her? NO, NO, I'M GONNA TELL HER. WHERE ARE THEY HOLDING HIM? - Brooklyn House of Detention. - I'M ON MY WAY. ( receiver clunks ) - ( doorbell buzzing ) - COMING! - WHO IS IT? - IT'S ME, AL MENETTI. HI. WHAT IS IT? SUSAN... WHAT IS IT? OH, NO. ( crying ) OH... NO. NO. ( chattering ) Woman on TV: ...time to review it. Tom. Tom: A series of developments in the disappearance of Alexander Selky have culminated in the arrest of Patrick Sullivan, also known as Philippe Lucien. As you may recall, Alex disappeared four months ago while walking to the Brooklyn elementary school he attended. Here's a report filed earlier in the day from Fred Stahl at the Brooklyn House of Detention. Patrick Sullivan was arrested last night after being under police surveillance for some time. Sullivan, who worked as a part-time houseboy in the Selky home, is a convicted sex offender and avowed homosexual. He was arrested in his Brooklyn apartment while in the company of a 14-year-old male prostitute. I tried to get a word from Sullivan as he was being transferred from the Brooklyn House of Detention to the Kings County Courthouse for his arraignment. Reporters: Mr. Sullivan! Mr. Sullivan! ( reporters shouting ) Man: Is it true you've been offered $50,000-- Have you talked to Mrs. Selky? Have you talked to Mrs. Selky? ( shouting continues ) Man: Have you talked to Mrs. Selky? We will keep you posted as to further developments in the case. This is Fred Stahl, WOR-TV News, from the Brooklyn House of Detention. ( classical piano music playing ) ( chattering ) Boy: LIAR, LIAR, LIAR. YOU ARE A LIAR. YOU ARE A FAT LIAR. STEP IN. TAKE A KEY FROM THE MALE OFFICER. SIGN YOUR NAME AND KEY NUMBER. - MISS, RIGHT HAND, PLEASE. - REMOVE ALL NECKLACES, WATCHES AND ALL BRACELETS. PUT THESE ITEMS IN YOUR LOCKER. STEP IN. TAKE A KEY FROM THE MALE OFFICER. SIGN YOUR NAME AND KEY NUMBER. ( clears throat ) ( lock clanks ) Woman: I DON'T THINK HE'D REALLY NEED IT. WELL, HE CAN ASK FOR CIGARETTES. HE DOESN'T NEED ANY CIGARETTES. ( people chatting ) ( chattering ) - I'M TIRED. LOOK-- - YOU BE QUIET. YOU BE QUIET. WELL, WHY NOT? 'CAUSE I DIDN'T DO IT. I'M IN THIS PLACE. I DIDN'T DO IT. - ( woman speaks ) - Man: WELL, I DON'T WANT HIM. GET SOMEBODY ELSE. JAMES, I KNOW HE WAS STAYING WITH YOU. YOU ALWAYS DO THIS TO ME. DON'T TELL ME TO SHUT UP, 'CAUSE I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THIS. I KEEP CALLING AND CALLING. YOU NEVER CALL ME BACK. I WANT YOU TO CALL HIM UP FOR ME, YOU KNOW? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO CALL YOU, PHILIPPE OR PATRICK? PATRICK. YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME. SUSAN, I MAY BE GUILTY OF MANY THINGS, BUT I NEVER HURT ANYBODY WHO DIDN'T WANT ME TO. AND I DID NOT EVER, IN ANY WAY, HURT ALEX. IN 1976 YOU WENT TO JAIL FOR SODOMIZING A MINOR, FOR RAPE, PHILIPPE. IN SALT LAKE CITY, I FELL IN LOVE WITH A COLLEGE FRESHMAN. HE WAS A MUSIC PRODIGY. HIS FATHER WAS AN ELDER OF THE CHURCH. WHEN HIS PARENTS FOUND OUT ABOUT US, THEY HAD ME ARRESTED FOR RAPE. I GUESS THEY FIGURED IF THEY CHANGED WHAT IT WAS CALLED, THEY WERE CHANGING WHAT IT WAS. YOU PLEADED GUILTY. THAT SURPRISES YOU. YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT MORMONS... OR UTAH. WHY DID YOU LIE ABOUT WHERE YOU WERE WHEN HE DISAPPEARED? IF YOU WERE A FAGGOT WITH A RECORD LIKE MINE, - WHAT WOULD YOU DO? - NO, YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION. YOU SAY YOU WERE WITH A DATE. WHO IS HE? - WHY CAN'T ANYBODY FIND HIM? - I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HIS NAME. A WITNESS SAYS HE SAW YOU NEAR OUR HOUSE THE MORNING ALEX DISAPPEARED. NOW YOU EXPLAIN THAT. ERROR, MISTAKEN IDENTITY, SOMETHING ELSE-- TAKE YOUR PICK. PHILIPPE, WHEN THEY PICKED YOU UP, YOU HAD A PAIR OF ALEX'S UNDERPANTS IN YOUR POCKET. THEY WERE BLOOD-SOAKED. LAST SPRING, I WAS AT YOUR HOUSE WASHING DISHES, AND I BROKE A GLASS IN THE SINK. I CUT MYSELF. IT BLED LIKE HELL. I JUST REACHED FOR A RAG TO STOP THE BLEEDING. I KEEP ALEX'S OLD CLOTHES UNDER THE SINK FOR POLISHING. I STARTED HOME WITH THESE UNDERPANTS TIED AROUND MY HAND. AND WHEN THE BLEEDING STOPPED, I PUT THE UNDERPANTS IN MY POCKET. I HADN'T HAD THAT JACKET ON SINCE SPRING. SUSAN, COME IN. - HOW ARE YOU? - I'M OKAY. HI. - SIT DOWN. - THANK YOU. I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU. I'VE JUST COME FROM THE HOUSE OF DETENTION. I'VE SPOKEN TO PHILIPPE. AL, I THINK YOU MADE A MISTAKE. - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING-- - NO, WAIT A MINUTE. LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. DID YOU EVER AT ANY TIME TALK TO HIM YOURSELF? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? OF COURSE I TALKED TO HIM. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE HIM. - HE'S GOT AN UGLY PAST. - HE'S GOT ONE CONVICTION IN NINE YEARS. HIS APARTMENT IS FULL OF THE KINKIEST SHIT I'VE EVER SEEN. THAT'S NOT A CRIMINAL OFFENSE, AL. LOOK, HE GAVE US A PHONY ALIBI. YES, AND NOBODY'S EVER FOUND THE GUY HE WAS WITH. WE HAVE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE. WE GOT WITNESSES. WE GOT OPPORTUNITY. HAVE YOU GOT MOTIVE, AL? WHAT MOTIVE DID HE HAVE FOR HURTING ALEX? HE LOVED HIM. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE WERE AFRAID OF. FOR THE RECORD, YOU DON'T NEED A MOTIVE FOR A SEX CRIME. HERE. HERE, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS REPORT FROM THE PRISON PSYCHIATRIST AT UTAH. "FIRST ARRESTED AT THE AGE OF 12 FOR STEALING A CAR. TWO YEARS JUVENILE HALL. BEATEN BY HIS STEPFATHER. NO NORMAL SEXUAL CONTACT WITH WOMEN. IT IS THIS EXAMINER'S OPINION THAT THE PRISONER IS A PSYCHOPATHIC PERSONALITY WITH A CLEAR DISPOSITION TO COMMIT SEXUAL CRIMES THAT MAKE HIM A MENACE TO SOCIETY." AL, YOU WERE THE ONE THAT TOLD ME THAT PRACTICALLY ALL CHILD MOLESTERS WERE HETEROSEXUALS, THAT A GAY MAN WAS THE LEAST LIKELY CANDIDATE. SUSAN, ALEX TRUSTED PHILIPPE. HE WOULD HAVE GONE WITH HIM QUIETLY WITHOUT QUESTION. YOU TALK ABOUT PHYSICAL EVIDENCE. BESIDES THE UNDERPANTS, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU. - YOU WHAT? - I'M NOT GONNA DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU OR ANYBODY ELSE. WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THIS CASE TRIED IN THE PRESS. AND STOP LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT. I'M NOT THE ONE WHO KILLED YOUR SON. ALL I DID WAS FIND THE ONE WHO DID. IF YOU'RE WRONG, AL, MY SON IS STILL MISSING. YEAH, BUT I THOUGHT THEY ARRESTED SOME GAY GUY FOR KILLING THIS KID. YES, THEY DID, BUT THEY MADE A MISTAKE. LOOK, WHAT CAN I TELL YOU? IT TURNS OFF THE CUSTOMERS, YOU KNOW? SOMEONE OUGHTA TELL THE PARENTS ENOUGH ALREADY. OKAY. THANK YOU. HOW WAS LUNCH? ( knock on door ) - HELLO. - COME ON IN. OH, GOD, IT'S HOT. YOU KNOW, I WENT OVER TO THE MARKET. HAVE YOU SEEN THE PRICE OF TOILET PAPER LATELY? I'M GONNA END UP BUYING IT ONE ROLL AT A TIME. YOU THIRSTY? YOU WANT SOME OF THIS? YOU OKAY? ( sighs ) I AM SO GODDAMNED ANGRY. AT WHAT? DO YOU REMEMBER THAT CHARLOTTE MAYHEW WOMAN FROM "MOTHER'S DAY" MAGAZINE? OH, THE HAIR? WHO WAS ON MY CASE FOR A MONTH TO GET ME TO WRITE AN ARTICLE ABOUT ALEX, HOW MUCH GOOD IT WOULD DO FOR THE PARENTS OF MISSING CHILDREN, LEGISLATION, PUBLIC SERVICE. ALEX WAS SO APPEALING. MIDDLE AMERICA COULD RELATE. ET CETERA. ET CETERA. ET CETERA. ET CETERA. WELL, A MONTH AGO AFTER PHILIPPE WAS ARRESTED, THEY CALL ME, AND THEY SAY THEY'VE DECIDED TO CANCEL THE PIECE. A WEEK AGO, I WROTE TO THEM, AND I TOLD THEM THAT I HAD BEEN TO THE JAIL TO SEE HIM AND THAT I BELIEVED HIM TO BE INNOCENT AND THAT THE POLICE HAD MADE A MISTAKE. IT WAS THEREFORE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAT THEY PUBLISH THE ARTICLE, SO TODAY, I GET THIS PIECE OF SHIT FROM THE CRUSADING JOURNALIST. "DEAR MRS. SELKY..." "WE FEEL THAT MUST HOLD TO OUR DECISION TO CANCEL THE PIECE. WE DO NOT FEEL THAT OUR READERS ARE READY FOR ANYTHING DEALING WITH HOMOSEXUALS." I MEAN, JESUS CHRIST, WHERE DO THEY THINK THESE KIDS ARE, DISNEYLAND? DON'T UNDERSTAND PEOPLE! YOU KNOW? SUSAN. I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING. I DON'T WANT TO. BUT IT'S TIME. YOU'RE VERY BRAVE. YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT, AND YOU'VE HANDLED IT LIKE A SOLDIER, BUT IT'S OVER. ALEX IS GONE, AND HE'S NOT COMING BACK. AND THE WAY YOU'RE BEHAVING MAKES ME AFRAID FOR YOU. UH-HUH. YOU HAVEN'T GOT A GRIP ON REALITY. IF YOU DON'T GET HELP SOON, I'M AFRAID YOU'LL GO SO FAR, WE WON'T GET YOU BACK. WAIT A SECOND. IF I DON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU BELIEVE, I'M NOT FACING REALITY? NO, I JUST THINK YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THERAPY. WHY? SO YOU CAN FEEL BETTER. I DON'T WANNA FEEL BETTER. I WANT MY SON BACK. CAN YOU HEAR YOURSELF? "I DON'T WANNA FEEL BETTER." CAN YOU HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? LOOK, ISN'T THERE SOMETHING USEFUL THAT YOU COULD BE DOING? SHOULDN'T YOU BE AT YOUR POTTERY CLASS OR SOMETHING? GOD, WHAT BUSINESS IS THIS OF YOURS? I'M YOUR FRIEND. I LOVE YOU. AND THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME. THIS IS ABOUT YOU. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO REALIZE THAT THIS OBSESSION OF YOURS IS DOING YOU DAMAGE? WHEN IS IT GOING TO STOP? WHEN I CAN'T STAND ANY MORE. WHEN I CAN'T STAND ANY MORE! AND NOT ONE MINUTE BEFORE THEN. WHERE THE HELL DO YOU GET OFF TELLING ME HOW TO RUN MY LIFE? BECAUSE YOURS IS SUCH A MODEL OF ORDER? YOU CAN YELL AT ME ALL YOU WANT IF IT'LL HELP. IT COULD BE A FIRST STEP. "IT'S A FIRST STEP. THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU. IT'S ABOUT ME." OH, PLEASE DO ME A FAVOR, WILL YOU?
