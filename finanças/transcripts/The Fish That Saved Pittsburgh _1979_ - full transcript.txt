[MURRAY SPORTS] WELL, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WERE BORN AGAIN, YOU JUST HAVE TO PUT AT THE TOP OF YOUR LIST THE PITTSBURGH PYTHONS. I'LL TELL YOU, IF THEY GAVE A COMEBACK- OF-THE-YEAR AWARD TO AN ENTIRE TEAM, YOU KNOW IT WOULD GO TO THIS INCREDIBLY GUTTY GROUP OF GUYS. THE PYTHONS HAVE WON 12 STRAIGHT, INCREDIBLY ENOUGH, IF YOU'VE BEEN SLEEPING UNDER A ROCK THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO DO ON YOUR HOME COURT, WHERE THEY BEAT THE LIKES OF L.A., DENVER, PORTLAND, CHICAGO, PHILADELPHIA, AND SAN DIEGO. BUT DIG THIS-- THE PYTHONS HAVE ALSO RUN OFF A STRING OF CONSECUTIVE VICTORIES AGAINST SEATTLE, KANSAS CITY, HOUSTON, BOSTON, INDIANA, AND SAN FRANCISCO ON THE ROAD. AND YOU JUST DON'T DO THAT IN THIS LEAGUE THESE DAYS. UNLESS, AS IT'S RUMORED ABOUT THE PYTHONS, THE TEAM IS BEING MASTERMINDED BY A WOMAN ASTROLOGER. WHOEVER IS CALLING THE SHOTS, THESE GUYS WERE HAVING FUN AT THAT INDIANA GAME WITH A 30-POINT LAUGHER FOR THE PYTHONS. AND ANOTHER STAT THAT'S PROVOKING SOME SMILES-- 4 CONSECUTIVE 30-POINT GAMES FOR MOSES GUTHRIE. THE PYTHONS ARE BEGINNING TO AMAZE PEOPLE AROUND THIS LEAGUE WITH THEIR COLLECTION OF WEIRDOES, MISFITS, AND, UH, SOME OTHER GUYS. THE PYTHONS SURPRISED EVERYBODY, PROBABLY EVEN THEMSELVES, CERTAINLY WASHINGTON. THEY STUNNED THEM WITH SOME VERY SNAPPY SCORING. SOME STATISTICS? WELL, LISTEN TO THIS. MOSES GUTHRIE-- 43 POINTS. THAT'S MORE LIKE IT. BEGINNING TO EARN YOUR MONEY, MR. GUTHRIE. TYRONE, WHAT'S THE SCORE? AND SOME NEWCOMERS ADDED IN TO THE SCORING DISPLAY. SET SHOT BUFFORD AND JAMAAL TRUTH WITH 20 APIECE. NICE GOING GUYS. WELCOME TO TOWN. THE SCORE, THE SCORE, COME ON. OH. UH, THE FINAL SCORE IN THAT GAME, INCIDENTALLY, IS, UH, PYTHONS 122, WASHINGTON 118. GET DOWN, PYTHONS! GET DOWN, PYTHONS!

IT'S TAKEN THE TOWN BY STORM. NO WONDER. PITTSBURGH PISCES HAVE BECOME THE CINDERELLA TEAM NOT ONLY OF BASKETBALL, BUT PROBABLY OF ALL SPORTS FOR ALL TIME. STARTING FROM LESS THAN GROUND ZERO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEASON, THEY MADE IT 2/3 OF THE WAY THROUGH THE PLAYOFFS SO FAR, AND THEY'VE TAKEN THE LAST SERIES DOWN TO THE FINAL GAME. JUST TO REVIEW THEIR EXCITING CINDERELLA FINISH-- THEY BEAT CHICAGO 3 OUT OF 5 IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THE PLAYOFFS. AND THAT INVOLVED WINNING TWO GAMES ON THE ROAD, SOMETHING THE PISCES HAVE DONE WITH STARTLING REGULARITY SINCE THEIR AMAZING TURNAROUND IN MID-SEASON. THEN THEY WENT DOWN TO THE NATION'S CAPITAL AND STOLE THE PLAYOFF SERIES FROM WASHINGTON, 4 OUT OF 7. AND THEN THE FISH FEVER REALLY BEGAN TO SPREAD. TALK ABOUT A CINDERELLA TEAM, AT THIS POINT YOU CAN FORGIVE THE PISCES IF THEY THINK THEY'RE WEARING GLASS SLIPPERS INSTEAD OF TENNIS SHOES. BUT NOW IT GETS EVEN MORE EXCITING. THE COUNTDOWN TO THE FINAL GAME OF THE FINAL ROUND OF THE PLAYOFFS AGAINST L.A. PISCES HAVE TAKEN L.A. ALL THE WAY IN A 3 AND 3 SERIES, SO FAR. AND THEY'VE GOT THE GOOD FORTUNE TO BE PLAYING THE FINAL GAME IN A SERIES AT HOME TONIGHT HERE IN PITTSBURGH. FOR THAT THERE'S A RECEPTION BEING GIVEN FOR THEM BY THE MAYOR OF THE TOWN. AND HE BETTER PRINT UP A LOT OF KEYS TO THE CITY, THEY'RE GOING TO NEED EVERY BIT OF LUCK THEY CAN GET AS THIS FINAL CHAPTER OF A FAIRY TALE SEASON UNFOLDS. WE CAN KIDNAP BROCKINGTON, SIR, OR-- NO, NO, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT US TO DO. NO. GIVE ME ANOTHER IDEA, COME ON. THE ASTROLOGY WOMAN? MONA MON-- MONDIEU? EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT.

HELLO AGAIN, EVERYBODY, FROM COURTSIDE THIS IS CHICK HEARN WELCOMING YOU TO THE LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. LOS ANGELES AGAINST THE PITTSBURGH PISCES. WHAT A GAME IT SHOULD BE. LOS ANGELES WITH PEOPLE LIKE KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR, CONNIE HAWKINS, LOU HUDSON, NORM NIXON, LUCIEN TUCKER-- ALL TO CHALLENGE MOSES GUTHRIE AND HIS TEAMMATES. LOS ANGELES CONTROLS THE TIP. A HOOK SHOT NO GOOD FOR LOS ANGELES. REBOUND IS TAKEN OFF THE RIM BY BULLET HAINES. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PISCES TO HIT THE SCOREBOARD FIRST. BOUNCE PASS COMES OVER TO GUTHRIE. HIS PASS INTERCEPTED. NICE PLAY BY BILL PINE. NOW DOWN THE FLOOR THEY GIVE IT TO NORM NIXON, THEIR LITTLE POINT GUARD, AVERAGING 18.5 POINTS A GAME. HE GOES TO THE FREE THROW LINE. HIS 15-FOOTER IS GOOD! AND LOS ANGELES IS IN FRONT 2 TO NOTHING. IN WHITE, THE PISCES ON THIS PSYCHEDELIC FLOOR. ONE OF THE MOST UNUSUAL BASKETBALL FLOORS MAN WILL EVER SEE. REVEREND JACKSON WITH IT. HIS PASS COMES INSIDE, BACK TO JACKSON. UNDERNEATH THE BASKET, TRAVELING IS CALLED. OVERPASSING ON THE PLAY. THE PISCES, THEY LOOK A LITTLE BIT TENSE. THEY CAME OUT IN A COUPLE OF THE GAMES IN THE PRELIMINARY ROUNDS OF THE PLAYOFFS THE SAME WAY, BUT RALLIED, AND HERE THEY ARE IN THE CHAMPIONSHIPS. KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR, A DOMINANT FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF BASKETBALL. AND OUTSIDE, LUCIEN TUCKER BURNS HIS EX-TEAMMATE. DOESN'T HE LIKE THAT. NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN TUCKER AND PARTICULARLY GUTHRIE. LOU HUDSON KNOCKS THE BALL AWAY. HIS TEAMMATE GETS THE BALL, AND THAT'S TUCKER. DOWN THE FLOOR TO NIXON. BEAUTIFUL PASS UNDERNEATH TO RON CARTER. AND A SPINNING LAY-UP. OH. A SENSATIONAL PLAY BY LOS ANGELES. BACK ON DEFENSE, THE 7'2" KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR. A LOT OF PUSHING AND SHOVING, PARTICULARLY IN THAT 3-SECOND AREA. THE BALL COMES OUT IN FRONT. THE PISCES PUT UP A SHOT, AND THEY DRILL IT HOME. NICE SHOT OUT IN FRONT BY SET SHOT BUFFORD. STOLEN. THEY HAVE THE BALL ONCE MORE COMING BACK, AND DOWN THE MIDDLE GOES LOS ANGELES. A SLAM DUNK-- LUCIEN TUCKER. AND HE HAS A SMILE AS HE COMES BACK DOWN THE FLOOR. O.K. I WANT YOU TO GET A NOTE OFF TO THE L.A. BOYS 'CAUSE THEY'RE GONNA WIN, AND THEY'RE GONNA WIN BIG. I WANT TO SEND THEM SOME LITTLE GOODIES, SOME, UH, SOMETHING IN THE ORDER OF A BASKETBALL, MAYBE A PAPIER-MACHé WITH THEIR INITIALS ON IT. BE KIND OF CUTE... AND CHEAP. UM, HOW ABOUT SOME EXOTIC FRUITS FROM THE ISLANDS? OUR ISLANDS. AND THIS--THIS IS UNIQUE. GET THIS DOWN. BLACK THINGS FOR BLACK PLAYERS AND WHITE THINGS FOR WHITE PLAYERS. THAT WAY, WE HAVE NO PROBLEMS. THE LOS ANGELES CLUB WAS FAVORED COMING INTO THIS GAME, DESPITE THE BRILLIANCE THIS YEAR, IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE SEASON, AT LEAST, BY THE PISCES. HERE'S SET SHOT BUFFORD AGAINST MITCHELL. TAKES IT OVER TO MOSES GUTHRIE. GREAT PLAY! THE FIRST STEP BEAT LUCIEN TUCKER. AND NOW THEY ARE BUMPING HARD WITH ELBOWS. AND SOMETHING BIG COULD COME OF THIS. LET'S HOPE NOT. WE DON'T WANT TO SEE EITHER MAN EJECTED FROM THIS GAME. INTERCEPTION! JAMAAL TRUTH, THE ARABIC HEADDRESS BLOWING IN THE BREEZE. HE'S GOT A SLAM DUNK! HE MISSED THE SHOT! AND THAT'S THE TRUTH. OH. WHAT A BIG PLAY IN THIS BALLGAME. LOOKS LIKE OUR CINDERELLA TEAM'S ABOUT TO TURN INTO A PUMPKIN. WHAT DID YOU SAY? I SAID THE CINDERELLA TEAM'S ABOUT TO CHANGE INTO A PUMPKIN. IT'S A CRYIN' SHAME. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE PISCES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PLAY BETTER... CINDERELLA... MIDNIGHT... LOS ANGELES HAS BUILT UP A COMMANDING LEAD. AND THEY ADD 2 MORE TO IT TO GO UP BY 15 POINTS... EVERYTHING IS WRONG OUT THERE TONIGHT, AND NOTHING'S HAPPENING RIGHT. WHY IS THAT? A STRANGE ASTROLOGICAL CONFIGURATION THAT HAPPENS ONCE OUT OF EVERY 12 YEARS. THE PISCES IS BLOCKED. THEY'RE JAMMED. UNTIL TOMORROW. WHICH IS EXACTLY, UM... AN HOUR AND 45 MINUTES FROM NOW. BUT AFTER THAT... AFTER THAT, WE'RE... HOME FREE! HOME FREE! ALL WE GOT TO DO IS STALL UNTIL TOMORROW. AFTER MIDNIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN. HERE'S HAINES FLIPPING THE BALL OVER TO THE RUNNING HAWK. AND HERE'S THE END OF THE HALF. [HORN BLOWS] AND AT THE HALF, LOS ANGELES LEADING 62 TO 47. WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE ANYWAY? NO HUSTLE! NO FAITH! NO HEART! CHALK... IF YOU WANT TO MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL... FIND MONA. FIND MONA. YEAH. YOU GONNA CHANGE THE TIRE? YOU CHANGE THE TIRE. I GOT THE GAS AND THE BEER. I GOT RIGHTS, YOU KNOW. I JACKED UP THE CAR. NOW YOU GOTTA CHANGE THE TIRE. I DRIVE THE CAR. YOU GOTTA CHANGE THE TIRE. AS OF NOW, AMATEUR, YOU AND I IS A WASH! [STARTS CAR] THE GIRL! YOU SEE THIS? I KEEP THE END WITH THE POINT. I THROW AWAY THE END WITH THE ERASER! YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? NO MORE MISTAKES! TONIGHT WE HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE HISTORY! BUT ONLY IF WE WIN! COMING CLOSE DOESN'T COUNT. THIS IS BASKETBALL! CLOSE ONLY COUNTS IN HORSESHOES AND HAND GRENADES! SO, TYRONE, HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT? WE JUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. THAT'S RIGHT. LET'S GO. ALL THE WAY LIVE. LET'S WEAR IT OUT, Y'ALL.

[WHISTLE] GET THE BALL! AAH! WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE? LOOK AT THAT! THOSE ARE FLOATIN' BALLS! [WHISTLE] BROCKINGTON! GIVE ME ANOTHER BALL! SHIT. TWO MINUTES, BROCKINGTON! YOU GOT TWO MINUTES TO GIVE ME AN OFFICIAL BASKETBALL! IF YOU DON'T, THIS GAME'S GOING TO BE FORFEITED! I'VE HAD ENOUGH! WELL, AFTER THAT LITTLE BY-PLAY, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT A REAL BASKETBALL FILLED WITH REAL AIR. DOWN THE FLOOR COMES BULLET HAINES FOR THE PISCES. HIS PASS IS INTERCEPTED BY LUCIEN TUCKER. DOWN THE FLOOR COMES LOS ANGELES. NORMAN NIXON ON THE SCORING END OF THE PLAY. AND LOS ANGELES REALLY MAKING A FARCE OF THIS BASKETBALL GAME RIGHT NOW. HERE COMES MOSES GUTHRIE. HE ALMOST LOST THE HANDLE ON THE DRIBBLE. MAKES A GREAT WRAPAROUND BOUNCE PASS. IT GOES OVER TO THE FAR SIDE. A LITTLE JUMP SHOT THAT'S WAY SHORT, AND NOTHING IS GOING RIGHT FOR THE PISCES TONIGHT. THEY ARE HAVING ALL KINDS OF TROUBLE IN EVERY FACET OF THE BASKETBALL GAME. THEY CAN'T SHOOT IT. THEY CAN'T CATCH IT. THEY CAN'T DRIBBLE IT. THEY CAN'T PASS IT. AND WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT KIND OF A SITUATION, IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH TO CATCH A TEAM AS GREAT AS THIS LOS ANGELES CLUB. INSIDE, A WRESTLING MATCH GOING ON. AND A LOT OF PUSHING AND SHOVING. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. TUCKER REALLY JUMPS IN, AND HE KNOCKS HAMMER DOWN. HE KNOCKED HIM DOWN HARD, AND THEY EXCHANGE A FEW UNPLEASANTRIES. THIS BASKETBALL GAME IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT OUT OF HAND FOR THE PISCES. AND IF THEY'RE GOING TO RALLY AND WIN THIS CHAMPIONSHIP, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY TURN IT ON, AND DO IT VERY QUICKLY. OH. JACKHAMMER FOR TWO. TUCKER, I'LL MAKE A FOOL OUTTA YOU. ENOUGH OF THAT! YOU'RE ON. [WHISTLE] HA HA. [CROWD] AWWW! [CROWD CHEERS] WHOO-HOO! HA HA! WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT TO MIDNIGHT. ONCE AGAIN, LOS ANGELES ON THE MOVE. CONNIE HAWKINS PASSED TO KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR FOR THE DUNK SHOT. TIME OUT HAS BEEN CALLED NOW BY THE PISCES. THEY TRAIL 101 TO 91. I'LL BE DAMNED. THIS TEAM AIN'T GONNA ROLL OVER AND SURRENDER TO NO CLOCK. NO WAY. SUNSHINE. AFTER 14 YEARS OUT THERE BARNSTORMING FOR PEANUTS, MAN... YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET THE GOLD SLIP THROUGH YOUR FINGERS NOW, ARE YOU? AND, YOU, TRUTH. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING SHITTY BOUNCE AFTER SHITTY BOUNCE JUST TO GET TO THE BRIDGE. NO MAN ALIVE SHOULD STOP YOU FROM CROSSING OVER. AND, YOU, JACKSON. YOU'VE SPENT YOUR WHOLE LIFE TELLING PEOPLE WHAT YOU THOUGHT THEY SHOULD DO WHEN A SITUATION'S JUST LIKE THIS ONE. DON'T LET THAT FAITH YOU'VE GIVEN THOSE FOLLOWERS DESERT YOU. NOW, WE'RE ALL MEN. IF THE TIME IS NOW FOR US TO BE TESTED, THEN LET IT HAPPEN. DON'T YOU SEE? THE ASTROLOGY THING IS JUST A MIRROR FOR US TO LOOK INTO. AN AID PUT THERE TO GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF GUIDANCE. SOMETIMES. WELL, WE GOT HERE 'CAUSE OUR MAGIC'S MADE OF SWEAT. AND STRAIN...AND PRIDE. THAT'S WHAT I'M TAKING BACK OUT ON THE GODDAMN COURT. IF YOU CATS ARE REAL MEN, AND I KNOW YOU ARE, YOU'RE GONNA COME BACK OUT THERE WITH ME... AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE FIRE IN YOUR HEARTS, AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE BLOOD IN YOUR EYES. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA DO WHAT WE CAME HERE TO DO! [GAME HORN BLOWS] I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE I CAN PLAY... BUT RISE, LAZARUS. BACK ONTO THE COURT COME THE PISCES, TRAILING IT BY 10 POINTS.

GIVE ME THAT PUSS WHEN YOU GET OUT THERE! DON'T USE IT HERE, SITTIN' ON YOUR BUTT! NIXON! WHEW! JABBAR. YOU DON'T SCARE ME! BIGGEST MAN IN THE WORLD? GET UP THERE AND PUT IT IN! [GAME HORN BLOWS] LISTEN, HOW ABOUT A CONDOMINIUM? HOW ABOUT A USED CAR LOT? A BLONDE, HUH? A LEAR JET. AIRPLANE. I'M NOT KIDDING. I CAN AFFORD THESE THINGS. WHO IS THIS FOOL? I'M WORTH $8 MILLION. YOUR OWN BROTHER. WHAT ABOUT MY BROTHER? GET OFFA ME, MAN. GIVE ME SOME GOOD NEWS. [SOBBING] WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME? OH, COMMISSIONER, ISN'T IT NICE? MY BROTHER IS FINALLY HAVING A GOOD TIME. 3 SECONDS LEFT TO PLAY. BALL OUT OF BOUNDS. BASELINE BACK COURT. HUDSON TAKES IT OUT. HUDSON'S PASS IS KNOCKED DOWN. FREE BALL! THEY SCRAMBLE FOR IT ON THE FLOOR. 1st AND 10 SHOULD BE THE CALL, BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A JUMP BALL. NOW LET'S SET THAT UP FOR YOU. WE CUT THE CLOCK DOWN. WE LOST TWO SECONDS THERE, AND IT'S DOWN TO ONE SECOND LEFT. HEY, REF! WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT? HE FOULED ME.
