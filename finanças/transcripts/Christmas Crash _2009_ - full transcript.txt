[music] [Teresa] Hi! It's so good to see you. Thank you so much for coming. Sorry, dinner should just be in a moment. [music] Hi! How are you? You look stunning. You look amazing. Thank you guys so much for coming. [music] Hi, how are you? Enjoying yourself? [music] Hi! How are you? Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm so sorry for the wait. Dinner should just be in a couple of minutes. [music] Mom, main course is ready, we really should try to serve it soon. -Um... Is daddy on his way? I don't know, he's not answering his phone. I'm tired of leaving messages on his voice mail. What is wrong with Dad? He knew about tonight. These are his friends too. I don't know what's wrong with your Dad, honey. Okay, that's it. I'm calling Matt. [phone ring] Hi sugar lips, how you doing? Hey, Babe, can you do me a favour? Can you put my dad on the phone please? No, he's in a meeting. I'm not going in there, I'll get fired. [Frank] It's up to the shareholders now, they're going to vote how they're going to vote. What can you do? Got to live with it. No, it's not that straight ahead. Someone's poisoning the well. I only got a week to reassure the other board members. How am I supposed to do that when I don't know what the heck's going on, without scaring everybody off? Well the company's strong; it'll survive no matter... sorry Joe. No matter if you're still in charge or not. What if they start cutting it up? Joseph, maybe it's time to hang up the saddle, huh? Put away the spurs? Give somebody else the reins; let them take it to the next level. You just sit at home and collect a big fat cheque. Sounds like a good idea. Not for me. I built this company myself from nothing. I spent years putting this together. What is it, Matt? Sorry to bother you boss, I got a phone call for Mr. J. Tell her I left. Ah, speaker phones, aren't they wonderful. Sorry sir. Yeah. Dad, where are you? You're supposed to be here. Well where do you think I am, honey, I'm at the office, okay. Everybody's been here for a while. They're about to start eating the furniture. Ah, listen, just go ahead without me, okay? Please, I'll be there when I get there. Hold on, Mom wants to talk to you. No... How could you do this? Everyone has been asking for you and don't forget that we're leaving tomorrow... [dial tone] Tell them to start serving. Okay. [music] [Joseph] Hey, Wes. Evening Mr. J. Put that on account and keep on pouring until the time you close. It's a little late Mr. J. There's no way you're going to drink a 100 bucks tonight. If I don't you can keep the change, all right? Go ahead. [music] Shouldn't you be in bed by now? What you did tonight was unforgivable. I got problems at work. You've got problems at home. I'm trying to tell you something and you're not listening. -I'm not listening? You haven't heard anything I've said in ten years. Is everybody ready to leave tomorrow, or what? That's right, just change the subject. That's what you do, isn't it? That's what I do cause I don't want to fight. Of course you don't want to fight, but you might actually have to. Do you know how much life you've missed? Don't you like this house? Where do you think it all comes from anyway? I'm paying for it. It costs money. Where does the money come from? I work for it! Work, right, is work the reason you stayed away until 3 A.M. this morning? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's what I've been doing. Probably not a really good time to tell you this I might not be able to go with you and the kids up to the lodge. I got some trouble with the board and I need to stick around and talk to them and make sure everything's worked out, okay? It's not a good time for me to leave town. I'm going to the lodge with or without you. And if it's without you, I'm not coming back. What time is your sister coming in? She's going to meet us up at the lodge tonight. I invited Matt to come out and spend a few days with us. Matt, you mean Frank's assistant Matt? Yeah, Mom said it was okay. -That's fine. I hope it's no problem. Okay, we're doing well on time. Let's go. I love strong women. Looks like you're in the doghouse again, Dad. Apparently. [music] [Nick] Hoo hoo! Hey, brought 'em! Hey, Nick. Hi, Uncle Nick. -Good to see you. -Oh, you too. I think you're big enough to call me just Nick now. Where's your sister? She's coming up later. Okay. How you doing old man? Not as old as you. Or as pretty. Good to see you. Look at all this stuff. Who's that? I know who that is. -Hey, handsome. -Hi. You been here long? No, not too bad, a couple of minutes. -Come meet my mother. -Okay. So I changed the locks like you asked, and are you planning on going flying, I can get it ready for you. I am, yeah, in the morning I think. Good idea. [Teresa] Mom, I'd like you to meet Matt. Why hello, welcome to our home. You must be the young man who was able to get my husband on the phone last night. -Yes, Ma'am, that was me. -Well, thank you. And this is my Uncle Nick. I mean just Nick. Nick, that's right, how're you doing? -Nice to meet you. -So I'm going to go get the plane ready, here are the keys and I'd like to help but I'm a little old for the heavy lifting. -Sure. Beginning to sound like me. Hey, Mr. J, thanks for having me. My pleasure, any time. Have you spoken to Frank? No, no, I don't expect to either, why? Expect to? Yeah, Mr. J was just asking if I was going to be speaking to Frank today. I don't expect to. If you do hear from the boys tell them that I'm not interested in knowing anything that's going on and in fact, I want to be left completely out of the loop. Yes, sir. Um, Teresa, will you help Matt get situated? He's going to be in the guest room at the top of the stairs and you're going to love the view by the way. Will you take this up to Teresa's room? You just get here and you're already talking about the office? You know I don't think the world is going to stop spinning around just because you say so. We're going to need to get a tree. I can take care of that. -You got it? -Ahha. So Teresa tells me that you're a pilot. Yeah, that's my affliction. Sounds pretty awesome. Did your dad teach you? No, my father passed away years ago. Nick taught me how to fly. You got to be kidding me. He's a great mechanic, good pilot in his own right. He's a Vietnam vet. He said he could land a bucket of spit, if the runway was long enough. -Dad, that's gross! -That's what he said. It's beautiful up there in the clouds looking down on the earth. No problem too big, no idea too outrageous. Amanda's here. Hey, Teresa! Want to drag that around back? Yeah. [Nick] I got it. [Amanda] Oh, great, hey! -Hi! -I missed you. -I missed you too. -Where's Mom? -She's inside. -Let's go. -Got a nice tree. -Good. -How's the plane looking? It's all ready. I take better care of that plane than I did my ex wife. That's why she's your ex wife. You got a point. I know all about it. I'm going through it with Christine right now. Maybe you're screwing her up? Take the word of the master. Yeah. I was thinking about taking her flying with me. -Yeah. -Get up there in the clouds like we used to before we got married. Plane's ready. But you should go soon, I think there's a weather system blowing in. Okay. [music] [Teresa] Anybody have matches? Look in my coat, I have a lighter in there. What are you doing with a lighter? Oh just a habit from my Girl Scout days, you know, be prepared. -Where's Dad? He's in his study making phone calls. That's not going to work. You know that I gave up my school's infamous Christmas party to be here. Better start treating me like a big girl. -Hah! -It's nice to have a dream. Hot cocoa, guys, works every time. Hot cocoa with all the fixings. You know, it was hot cocoa that made Gorbachev tear down that wall and don't get me started about Nixon and the Chinese. [laughter] History major. Hi, I'm up at the lodge. I'm calling all the board members. That's right. I don't want anybody to do anything until I speak to them face to face. At least do that for me, okay. What's going on Dad? What's not going on? Okay, what's not going on? Ah, Mom and I are having trouble. Yeah, that's what I've heard. You know I know I think that you guys just need some alone time. No writing and no business. Writing? What's that? See Dad, you don't even know. But I mean it's fine. It'll give you guys something to talk about. Okay. What's up with the company? Problems, problems, problems. Okay, okay, look, I think I've got just what you need. A nice cup of hot cocoa. Okay. Come on. [music] Thank you. I'm going flying tomorrow. Say goodbye to your Dad, girls, he escapes once again. And you're coming with me. Ha, in your dreams. Mom, go. It's exactly what you guys need, some alone time. I have plenty of alone time, thank you. That's for sure, but now you need quality alone time. She's right. Remember before they were born, we used to go up there all the time. It was nice. -There's a reason I stopped flying with you after the girls were born. In case you haven't noticed, Mom, we're all grown up now. Yeah, you don't have to watch out for us any more. That plane just makes me nervous. Ah, come on, Nick takes great care of that thing. We'll take the scenic route. We'll go to the cabin for a couple of hours and come straight back. I think it'll be a really nice day. I'll think about it. [phone rings] Excuse me for a sec, folks, I've got to take this. I won. -You cheated. -I didn't cheat. She's the cheater, Joseph. I just caught you. [Teresa] Here you go my dear. Thank you. Thank you. Hey boss, how're you doing? Matty, sorry to disturb you on your night off. No problem, what's up? I just want to know the status of the Vecchio project. The drawings are done and they're being processed by legal. We talked about this before I left. Is there some sort of problem? Boss? No, no, there's no problem at all. That's all I wanted to know, thanks. So how's everything going up there? Beautiful country, huh? Yeah, yeah, it's pretty beautiful up here. Joseph tell you about that plane of his? He flies it every time he goes up there. Yeah, yeah, he's taking her out tomorrow. He's like a different person when he's talking about flying. Hm, you going up with him? No, I don't think so. I think you should go. Anyway, that's all I wanted to know. Vecchio account, it's an important one, huh? Remember that. Sure. Night. Beautiful country isn't it? Yeah. Perfect day for flying. Yeah, it is. Listen, I'm really trying, Christine, okay. I feel like I'm alone over here. Is there anything you want to talk about? [phone rings] Hello. Oh, Frank, yeah, ahuh. Well you must be getting senile. Everything for Vecchio is all done. Everything's in legal. That's right. I'm with Christine, just the two of us; we're heading toward the airport. Okay, Frank, you call me if anything happens, all right? You know where I'll be. Okay. That's right, just the two of us. [Nick] Hey, good morning. How are ya? Hi. What's going on, you got some trouble? Somebody broke in last night. Wow, that' terrible. -Yeah. -Any damage? Aw, kid's stuff. They broke a few bottles and spilled some beer and broke into the candy machine. Are you ready for this? [music] Look at that view. Take your breath away or what? I'd forgotten how incredible it was. I'd forgotten. [music] Okay, it's your call. You see that little dot? -Yeah. At the end of the lake. That's the cabin. Want to fly straight there, come straight back, or take the scenic route. It's your call. How could anything be more scenic than this? You have forgotten haven't you? [music] [thump] -Let's go back. -That was nothing. Probably a little gust of wind or something. [music] Come on, one little bump and you go timid on me. You used to do that when we were kids. We're not kids. Now we have kids. Honey, don't go there, all right? Everything up to now has been okay. Do you think a few hours up in this plane was going to make up for years of... [thump, beeps] Ah, what's the matter? [music] Grab those control and pull back. What? Pull back with me. [gasps] Joseph. [groans] [coughs] Are you all right? Ah, my leg. My leg. Oh. Hold on, hold on. Don't move. [groans] Joseph, hold on. I got to pull it tight, okay? -Okay. [groans] Wait one second. [music] [music] [music] So, what's the problem with Mom and Dad? Same problem, Dad's always at work and Mom spends all of her time alone. I thought that would change once we moved out you know. Not so far. I got to tell you, I'm impressed. I didn't know you could cook. I always could cook, I just, I never did because I didn't have to. I was the baby. Yeah, well you sure squeezed that one for all it was worth. Yeah, that's for sure. Hey, do you think Matt wants a sandwich? We'll see. [phone ring] Hello. Yes, this is Teresa Johnson. Hey, Matt, want some lunch? Ah, yeah, sure. What? What are you saying? No! No! No! Matt! Matt! Hello, yes this is Amanda Johnson. Yeah, I'm her sister. She's fine, is there a problem? [Teresa] Matt, Mom and Dad's plane, it disappeared. I don't know, I just got a call, I don't know, I don't know... [sobs] It's okay. They'll find them, I'm sure. [music] [groan] Okay, I'm here. My shoulder, I think it's dislocated. I can fix that, but it's going to hurt. Yeah, I know. Okay. -Okay. -All right. Make a fist. -Okay. Ready, I'm going to bring it over. Ah, all right, all right, all right. One, two, three. [bones crunch, groan] [distant airplane engine] Who's that? Is that a rescue plane? Yeah. How are you feeling? Ha ha ha, what part of me? My mind or my body? Both. Pretty ugly. Great, cause we're in a heck of a mess. I'm just going to put this on. That's for sure. Okay, now why don't you remind me what happened? Well, the plane just stopped and fell out of the sky. Okay, what was it? Fuel, or an electrical problem? Structural? The problem wasn't structural until we hit the water. All right, that's important, that's important now. What's important is that we figure out what we're going to do next. I think we should stay right here, okay? No one is going to spot us. They're looking the wrong way. They expected us to go straight to the cabin and back. We're on the other side of the lake. It'll be a long time before they extend their search grid out here, but... What, what, go on? About eight miles on the other side of these woods is a main highway and if I can make it through I can flag down a car and bring back help. I can make that trip. You can't even stand up. Yeah, watch me. Joseph. Whoa, whoa. Hold on. Try this. All right, let's go. Let's go. Oh, Joseph, forget it, okay? Just stay here, let me get to the highway and I will bring back help. I'm not staying here! I'm not staying here. You watch me. Listen, if I stay here I'm just going to die. I'd be better off going with you. At least I'm on the move, right? Okay. Let's go. [music] [rumble of plane] [talk over radio] [music] A couple of hours after they left I tried to reach them on the radio to give them a winter weather alert but I got no response. I tried every frequency, I tried their cell phones. I got Sea and Air Rescue involved right away. Is there bad weather coming? Flurries, and a drop in temperature maybe worse. Mom and Dad aren't dressed warm enough. S.A.R. is out there looking for them right now and those guys are good. They'll find them. They will. How long before the weather starts to turn? I don't know, late this afternoon, early evening. But I came out because I wanted to tell you myself and make sure that you're all right. Thank you. I've got to get back. I'll make sure that you're kept up to date and if you need anything, call me. Who are you calling? I have to alert the company. Look, there could be a lawsuit here. Oh stop it Matt. Listen, all I'm saying... Hey boss. You know, I don't get what you see in him. Who else should we be calling? What should we do? We should call the relatives. I guess we're going to have to at some point. Frank wants to talk to you. Hi Frank, no, it's Amanda. Amanda, I am so sorry for you and your sister. Matt just told me what happened and I just want to assure you that we'll do anything we can to help. Thanks Frank, we'll let you know. And I'll personally make sure that your company holdings are protected after the merger. My Dad can protect our holdings. Yes, I'm sorry, I misspoke. Maybe I should come out there. No, Frank, you don't have to do that. Well, it's only a couple of hours drive, I could be there... You really don't have to do that. I'll have my Dad call you when we get him home. Yeah, it's me boss. I never liked Frank. He says there's a merger coming up. Not without Daddy there isn't. When news of this gets out the reporters are going to start calling. -Oh! I'm sorry. -Are you okay? Ah, I'm just tired. Okay. We should stop. It's only eight miles. We can make eight miles. You know what, we're losing the light and it's almost... I lost my watch. This is a good place to stop for the night, okay? What makes it so good? I don't want to stop. Joseph, come on, all right, we're not going to get to the road tonight and you look terrible and you need to rest. I don't feel so good. Eight miles you know, is not an easy walk under the best of circumstances. And you my love, are not at your best right now. So how far do you think we've come? Not far enough. Do you want some water? Yeah. I'm tired. I don't feel good. I think I'm going to get some sleep. Don't go to sleep, talk to me. Talk about what? I don't know. Whatever you want. What's on your mind? You might not like it. Ha, try me. Somebody's trying to rip me off. Somebody's trying to cheat me out. That's not going to happen. Why do you think that? I don't know. A lot of secret meetings, lies, innuendo, you name it. I'm surrounded by it. Lots of money too, lots of money, that's what it's all about in the end, right? I don't trust anybody. I know what's going on. You know, if I don't make it out of here, it'll be a lucky break for those guys. Hey, don't talk like that, okay? No one's going to die out here. I've held on to this long enough. I'm afraid dinner's going to be a little skimpy, but here, you can eat this one tonight and the next one tomorrow. Ah, no I can't. I don't really feel good. You know what? You have no idea what it takes to build a company like that. Do you know what kind of sacrifices a person has to make to get that kind of success? Yeah, sacrificing your family. That's the way you see it? Anything worth having, anything worthwhile, takes a lot of sacrifice, okay? A lot. I guess that just depends on your priorities. I got my priorities! You and the girls, those are my three priorities, okay? I gave you the life that you expected. It's a darn good one too. Wow, yeah, you built a heck of a company. Now we have money, and cars and go on nice vacations. Why do you make it sound like something bad. Joseph, we have everything, but we have lost each other. You don't understand me. I don't know you. [rustling of branches] Did you hear that? No, I didn't hear nothing. I've been hearing it all afternoon. Ah, forget about it. Okay, listen, I'm going to try and make us a little shelter before it gets dark. I'm sorry I haven't been very supportive of you these last few years. I can't believe you just said that. That was nice because I didn't make it very easy for you. I was starting to feel like the bad guy around here. I'm going to put some more wood on the fire. Okay. Hey! Get! Go on, get out of here! [snarl] Go! [music] Will you hold me? Yeah. [music] Is your shoulder okay? Yeah. [music] [Teresa] I hope Mom likes the blouse I got her. She will. She will, she will. Matt The police are here. [talk over radio] [car doors closing] We believe your parents never made it to the cabin. We had a man out there and he reported that it looked like no one had been there for a long time. Maybe they got lost in the woods back there. He searched the woods behind the cabin with similar results. There's no tracks or signs of anyone being there within the last 24 hours. We're sorry, but we believe Mr. and Mrs. Johnson's plane had a catastrophic failure and went down in the lake. But you're just guessing. You haven't found the plane so you don't really know what happened. They're probably floating out there right now, waiting to be rescued. You can't quit! They're not quitting ma'am. This is just a progress report. [Lawson] Before we suspended operations sonar hit upon a large shape about 60 feet under the water. And that shape and size is consistent with the fuselage of a small plane. -No! What do you mean consistent, you don't know what it is? We're sending divers in to investigate tomorrow, but for now the prognosis is not encouraging. We're very sorry. [Officer] I apologize, but I have to ask a few questions. The plane was in the care of Nicholas Stanley. How was the relationship between Mr. Stanley and your parents? He's a long time friend of the family. We call him Uncle Nick. What makes you think Nick did something to the plane? Well, like Warrant Officer Lawson indicated, the plane suffered a sudden failure. There was no radio communications, they didn't send a S.O.S. and the plane just suddenly disappeared. Now as far as you know, is there anyone you can think of who'd want to do your parents harm? No, of course not. Our parents are out there waiting to be rescued. That's all I know. [Lawson] Yes, ma'am, we will resume our search patterns at first light and we'll let you know what our divers find. We're very sorry. If you think of anything else, please let us know. [music] How you doing back there? Coming along. That's a heck of a black eye you've got. How's your vision? My vision's fine. Would you keep going. You don't look fine, how's your head? I got a splitting headache if you really want to know. Listen to me, you don't look fine, okay? It's already afternoon and I don't even think we're half way there. You're not going to leave me here, that's for sure. It's only going to be for a few hours. I can move much faster by myself. It's going to take you the rest of the afternoon to get up the hill. If I don't make it back in time, I'm going to lose everything. Is that all you think about? If you die out here, what good is that darn company of yours? That company is mine. It's me. I built that company, my own sacrifice. If I'm going to lose it all I might as well be dead. What about us? Your family, people that love you, don't we count for anything? That's not what I'm saying. You put words in my mouth. What kind of a provider would I be if I just let this thing that I sacrificed everybody's life for slip away? I'm not going to have anything taken from me. I'm not going to be made a failure. Don't talk to me like that. And if you do fail, it's not going to be because someone stole your precious company. [music] [Amanda] Hello, this is Amanda Johnson. Yeah, are you sure? Okay, thank you. It was a canoe. The shape they found at the bottom of the lake was a canoe. That means they're still alive. For Pete sakes, can you just get a grip? What? Hey, I'm all for hope, really I am, but one of you is going to have to act like an adult and face the facts here. Yeah, the facts are that they haven't found the plane crashed or otherwise, which means our parents could still be alive. The facts are that their plane suddenly disappeared over an open body of water. If they survived the crash, they've been exposed to cold, weather for two days with no food, no water or shelter. Those are facts. Well you know if that's what you think then to heck with you. You know, maybe you don't need to be here. You're being ridiculous, I'm just trying to help you. I don't need or want your help, okay? Why don't you just go home? You're throwing me out? What did you see in him again? He used to be cute. [music] [Recording] You've reached the office of Frank Martin. Please leave a message after the tone. [buzz of phone] Frank I know, I know, but timing is everything and the time is now. Look, all I'm saying is that we get together and resolve this so we can take it to the next phase. Okay, first thing tomorrow. I'll call the others. [music] [Amanda] The cabin's here. What if they made it to shore? Then they're in the wilderness. Good thing Mom remembers her Girl Scouts. -How ya doing? -I don't know. Oh yeah, how come? Well because it just occurred to me that in this situation, given the circumstances, it's completely possible... Yeah, I know, we could actually die out here. Here let me help you. -Yeah. Wouldn't it be ironic after all these years of being at each other's throats, if we died in each other's arms? I haven't been able to think about anything the last couple of hours except the kids. Yeah, well, they're the two biggest reasons that we have to stay alive out here. There's whole sections of their lives I can't even remember, Christmas maybe, 10 or 12 years ago. Ha ha, I guess I remember being able to buy them everything they had on their wish lists, nothing much after that. More than 12 years ago. I remember they insisted that you be the one that teach them how to ride their bikes because Daddy was a pilot. I don't remember that at all. That's because that was the year that your company started taking off and you started spending all your time at the office. I taught them how to ride. I don't have much memory of them as teenagers. I tell you one thing, I remember every hour I spent in that office, every deal I ever made, every client I ever had, every contract I signed. Right about now, I'd give it up. Just one memory of them, riding around on their bikes or maybe Amanda in her prom dress. I guess I missed that one too. You missed a lot. Yep. But now is not the time to give up. Okay we still have a long life ahead of us if we just keep going. [chuckle] What's so funny? [chuckles] Come on. [chuckle] I'm funny, I'm funny, [chuckle] thinking about you being timid. Guess I was all wrong about that. Just the opposite, aren't you? You say that to all the women you're stranded on mountain tops with. I've never been stranded on a mountain top with a woman before, let alone one that's smart and wise, good looking as you. Stop, you're going to make me cry. Where have you been hiding all these years? I don't know, working, trying to make everybody happy. Amanda says I should ask you about your writing. Oh, it's just something I've been working on. I sent my first manuscript into a publishing house. You wrote a book. Yeah. Wow, no kidding, wow. How long did that take? Four years. Gez. Maybe you'll let me read it sometime. Maybe. You think that's funny. I guess you'll never forgive me, right? I can always forgive you. That's my problem. I love you. I've loved you all my life and I will always love you. But when you started spending so much time at the office I realized how much this love is damaging me. I started to write just to find myself again. I have to tell you something. Joseph Go ahead. I've had divorce papers drawn up and they're ready to be signed. I'll never love anybody the way I love you. Maybe I'll find someone who wants to be a part of my life. Wow. Maybe you could have waited until after Christmas to tell me that. I was going to wait until after Christmas but things changed. [music] [Christine] I'm going to put some more wood on. [Joseph] Okay. [snarl] [gasp] [music] [Joseph] Arrrgh! [Christine] Joseph! Joseph! Get off him! Get out of here, go! Go! [music] [phone ring] Matt, what's up? I just got back into the city. Oh yeah, any more news on Joseph and Christine? No, nothing yet. It's been three days. They were probable killed in the crash. Is that what the police are saying? No, they haven't yet, but you know, it's what everyone thinks, except for Teresa and Amanda. Well that's certainly understandable, I mean they are their parents after all. So, what's on your mind? We need to talk, Frank. Sure, can't do that right now. Listen Matt, this has been a shock for everybody. It's a terrible tragedy. But Johnson Global Manufacturing may have caught a break here. Dawning of a new day Matt and if everything goes the way it's supposed to, there's going to be a place for those people that help make it happen. Why don't you get some rest and we'll talk soon, okay? [music] [laughter] [Frank] Ladies, gentlemen. Frank. -Welcome to the future. [TV Reporter] In an odd turn of events, Johnson Global Manufacturing is experiencing a period of explosive growth even though Johnson and his wife are still missing three days after crashing into Victory Lake. Sea and Air Rescue has been unable to resume their search this morning because of poor weather conditions. Joining us on the line right now is Warrant Officer Rick Lawson, a representative of Sea and Air Rescue. We thank you for coming on and talking with us this morning, Rick. What do you think their chances of survival... [glass breaking] Are you all right? What if we're too late? No, no Teresa, don't even think it. We're going to find them in time, maybe just in time, but in time. It's been three days! I don't care, three days, 30 days, I don't care. As far as I'm concerned they still exist outside the laws of nature. [sobs] Sea and Air are going to start flying again as soon as the weather clears a little. But the nights have been so cold. But it warms up again in the day. We can't give up, Teres. We can't give up on them. I'm convinced that they made to land and we have to be ready to take care of them when they're found. I'm not strong like you. I'm not strong, but I just, I can't think about it right now. There's too much other stuff to... As soon as this is all over, I'm going to sit and have myself a good cry. A real emotional meltdown, it's going to be a heck of a show. But not now. Do you know what today is? It's Christmas day. Then today's the day we find Mom and Dad. [knock on door] Nick Hi, how are you? Everybody is looking, hi, in the wrong place. I've been thinking about this. If they had engine failure in the middle of the lake they wouldn't have been able to glide to the shore and we would have found debris or an oil slick or something by now, we've found nothing. Your Dad loves to fly, there's no way he would have flown in a straight line from there to there and then straight back again. He told Mom that he was going to take her on the scenic route. He said that? The scenic route? Yeah. Why didn't I think of that? When he was younger, he didn't like to fly across the lake either, he always wanted to be close to the shore. So he wouldn't fly across the lake, he would go around the edge and he'd call that 'taking the scenic route'. Why aren't Air Rescue searching on land? Because they think he went in a straight line, I mean, it's logical. What do you want to do? Well, I think we should start looking for them. Let's do it. Let's go. [music] [music] [wolf snarls] [music] [snarls] [music] [snarl] Get! Go on! Get, get, get! [whimper] [music] Joseph. Joseph, Joseph, wake up. Where am I? -Wake up. -What happened to me? Listen to me. -What happened, where am I? -We have to go, okay? I had a crazy dream. I dreamed there was a whole bunch of wolves. Joseph, that wasn't a dream, okay, listen, listen to me, listen, no, no, no, please, Joseph, listen to me, okay? We have to get out of here. We're going to be rescued but we just have to stay alive long enough, please, Joseph. [music] This is going to hurt, I'm sorry. [sizzle, moan] [groan] Christine I'm sorry. Joseph, Joseph, listen to me. I forgive you, I forgive you so you better stay alive and you better not die out here because it'll break your daughters' hearts. It'll break mine too. Joseph! [wolf growl] [music] [music] See anything? Nothing yet. No. Keep your eye out for any kind of debris on the water. [music] [music] Okay you don't mess with me! Aaah! [snarl] Go away! [music] Amanda Look! Down there, right on the beach. -Where? Right down there, do you see it? I think that's them! Oh, we found them. [music] They're close. They're close. [music] [shouts] [snarls] Joseph! [music] Look! Smoke, dead ahead. [music] Go away! Get! [growls] Ha ha! We got them! [music] [wolf whimpers] [music] Mom! Nick Yeah! [music] [music] [Teresa] Dad! Mom! Mom, how's Dad? Are you okay? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [music] [phone ring] [TV Reporter] The incredible story of the harrowing rescue of businessman Joseph Johnson and his wife Christine after crashing their plane into Victory Lake they spent the next two days trudging through rugged wilderness until they were discovered by a rescue party. A large section of the plane's fuselage has been recovered and an investigation is under way to determine the cause of the crash. [cell phone beeps] [music] Frank Matt! Just the man I wanted to see. Hop in. Hi Frank, I'm not getting in your car. You'll kill me. Why would I want to do that? Here. What's this? Your Christmas bonus. See, there's nothing to be afraid of. Ha, look, why don't you tell me what you think is going on, I'll set you straight and we'll go from there. Okay, I'll tell you what I think. I think you told me to get on that plane because you knew something was going to happen and I was the only person that could tie you to it. And the only reason why you set me up with Teresa Johnson was to spy on Joseph and tell you when he was flying which I did, like an idiot. [chuckle] Matt, you're losing your mind. I just thought the plane experience would be enjoyable. Look, if something happened here and I'm not saying that it did, but if it did, you're in it up to your eyeballs. No, no, I had no idea what you were planning. Well, that's your story and if I were you I'd stick to it but nobody's going to believe you. And just between you and me, I can reach out and touch you anytime I want. Well, we'll just see whose story they believe. Don't be stupid. Hey, so Dad's still in surgery for his leg but they say he's looking really good. Good. How's Mom? Sleeping, but she moans sometimes. Yeah, well with the shape Dad was in I'm surprised she got them as far as she did. And fought off a pack of wolves to boot. Go Mom. Where's Joseph? Hey, Mom, just relax, everything's okay. You just got to stay in bed. [Amanda] How are you feeling? [Teresa] Can we get you anything? Is he doing okay? [Teresa and Amanda] Yeah, he's fine. [Amanda] They said they're going to let us know soon. Your Dad was just incredibly brave. What about you, Mom, I mean you were pretty brave yourself. No, no, it was your father, you know, he didn't give up so I didn't give up. Why would a perfectly good plane just fall out of the sky? [music] Inspector. You might want to take a look at this. See, it's sheared off here. [music] [Reporter] Can you tell us Mr. Johnson's status? Mr. Johnson is out of danger. His surgery was successful. We are keeping him in the I.C.U. for another 24 to 48 hours for observation. Mrs. Johnson's injuries were less serious and she's resting comfortably. Thank you. That's all for now. [Reporter] Miss Johnson, do you have anything to say? [Reporter] Zoom in on her. We're really happy to have them home, everybody's fine. My Dad still looks a little scary, but he's going to be all right and Mom never gave up. [Reporter] How did it feel to find them on Christmas morning after two days of not knowing if they alive or dead? It was the best Christmas present we could ever get. Thank you. [multiple voices] [Teresa] You did good, young lady, that wasn't so bad. Amanda No, it wasn't so bad, I was kind of nervous though, I've never done that before. [Teresa] Really, you did good. You did good. [laughs] So, I think Mom's getting released. Oh, great, we can finally go home. Mom, what's going on? The FAA did a preliminary inspection of the wreck and they believe it was sabotage. Somebody tried to kill Mom and Dad? They tried honey, but they didn't succeed. As I was telling you, Joseph's been really troubled the last few months and I'm so sorry that I didn't realize how serious it was. What did he say was going on? Just that someone was talking to board members, making secret deals and promises and that the plan was to push Joseph out and then sell the company to corporate raiders. Well, who was doing that? No one can say because they signed confidentiality agreements. But somebody tried to kill you. Those agreements can't possible stand up. Have you asked Frank? Who's Frank? Frank Martin is Joseph's business partner and he can't talk either. I'm okay. Matt's not answering his phone. -Who's Matt. -He's my boyfriend. Matt's also Frank's assistant. He was vacationing with us when the accident happened. Has this information been released yet? The FAA has not yet finished its investigation so these findings are inclusive. Would it be possible to keep it under wraps for a little while, because Joseph is in no shape to hear this kind of news. That would give us a few days to find out who's responsible. At length, the truth will out. The Merchant of Venice. Brainiac. My daughters are beautiful and smart. [laugh] Oh gosh. Be careful. I guess that's it for you and Matt, huh? Yeah, it's so over. Amanda helped me give him the boot. Yeah, you should have seen his face. Good, he deserved that. Guess I'll be buying a new plane. Okay, but um... Next week. [laughter] I'm not coming up in it with you. Yeah, how about both you guys don't go up. Yeah, really. I'm taking the whole family. No. Ha, ha. Hey Dad, do you know what? You haven't said anything about the company since we got here. I'm not thinking about the company, I'm only thinking about my family, the people that I love, the people that mean something. It's nice to have everybody here together. I'm being discharged today and I'm going to go home with Teresa but Amanda's going to stay at the lodge until you're ready to travel, okay? Okay. I'll call you later. All right. Bye Daddy. [Joseph] Bye sweetie. [Amanda] I'll call you. -Okay. See you later, sweetie. Bye. [Christine] Now let's find out who is stealing Joseph's company. Go Mom! [whir of paper shredder] [Secretary] Mr. Martin, Mr. Johnson is calling you again. Um, just tell him I'm busy right now, but I'll get back to him as soon as I can. [Secretary] But he's calling from the hospital. You heard what I said. [Secretary] All right, Mr. Martin. [whir of paper shredder] [music] [Christine] What's going on? [Teresa] Some friends wanted to welcome you home. [Christine] Teresa, surprise! [music] [Nick] Come in, come in, come in. Welcome home. [Christine] Oh, thank you. Your girls have been so wise and so strong and they've handle this so beautifully. [Christine] I know, I'm so proud of them. [Nick] So am I. But, there's a few people back here, that are dying to see you. Just dropped by. [multiple voices] Nick, have you seen Matt? No, I haven't. [chatter] Thanks so much for coming. [mingled voices] Joseph's so sorry he can't be here but he'll be here in a few days when he gets out of the hospital. But anyway, oh food, wine, I want some! Oh, did you organize this? [Nick] I had nothing to do with it. I'm so touched, thank you. Oh golly. [knock on window] Why are you sitting out here? Get in. Are you living in your car? This is, this is disgusting. You know that... Seriously Matt, what is the matter with you? It's so great that you're here. Thanks for having me. Listen, we were so relieved that you two are okay. We really feared the worst. Yeah, we're really glad you're home. Well I appreciate you being here. Sit down. I wanted to ask you, what's going on at the company? It's all Joseph could talk about. Somebody's been trying to push Joseph out by rigging the board. Joseph held them together as best he could but he couldn't find out who the money people were. And believe me, there was a substantial amount of money on the table. When you two disappeared and were presumed lost, the board got steamrolled into a vote. And I'm afraid it went against Joseph. He's lost control of the company. You're kidding. To who? I can't say, we all had to sign very strict confidentiality agreements to participate or we would have been locked out. Listen, it's not official yet, but we think that the plane was tampered with. Somebody tried to kill us. [Nick] And this agreement wouldn't hold up in court. [Matt] Fine. [Teresa] All right, tell them what you told me. I think Frank knew something was going to happen to the plane before it did. I'm calling the cops. How did Frank know we were going flying that day? He told him. He was keeping an eye on Dad and reporting back to Frank. No, that is completely unfair. It wasn't like that. I didn't know that anything was happening until... Until when? [Teresa] Frank told him to go flying with you and then the plane crashed. That's really all I need. It was Frank who engineered the showdown at Johnson Global Manufacturing. Police are on their way. I'm out of here. Christine No. You're going to tell the police what you know. In your dreams. Whoa whoa whoa! Sit down. Yeah. [music] [music] [music] Hey, hey, whoa whoa! [music] That's him. [distant music and voices] [music and voices] [clink clink clink] My wonderful family and all of our very good friends have no idea how much it means to us to have everybody here together. This last year has brought some changes into our family and we have a lot to be thankful for. To mention a few, our daughter Teresa has joined my company and, our company, [laughs] and has become quite the businesswoman. The brains of the family, Amanda, has received a scholarship and will be studying in Rome. Thank you. My great friend, master mechanic, and ace pilot Nick, has become smitten and engaged. Good luck, Nick! [laughs] My lovely wife Christine has finished her latest manuscript about the Christmas crash up in Victory Lake. Most importantly, the last year has brought Christine and I back together and we'd like to rededicate ourselves to each other right here in front of all the people that we love the most. [applause] Thank you all for being here. I just want to say that one year ago, this family was all but dead and it took a near fatal plane crash to bring us back to life and to teach us that the most important gift of all is family. So Merry Christmas! All Merry Christmas! [music]
