Timms, they've got to understand. My treatments are making him smarter at an incredible rate. It's more important than training him for war. You know our funding comes from the shop. They want this animal trained in virtual reality to use the infrared battle helmet, not to recite the abcs. I won't increase the dosage of aggression drugs. He's already exhibiting behavioral instability in the virtual battle simulations. What you're suggesting, could destroy his mind. There is no choice, Larry. They don't care about his intelligence enhancement. They want his primal rage centers fully stimulated. He is to be battlefield ready. Fucking screw the political assholes. He's the best chimp I've ever had. Battlefield simulation engaged. Primate response optimum. Threat. Kill complete. Threat. Let's check out sector 10. - Okay, check level two. - Got it. Threat. Targeting. Acquire. Acquire. Acquire. Attack. Kill complete. Evasive. Security breach inside sector 14, level 5. 14, level 5. Threat. Evasive. Threat. Clear. Check the upper building. Go! Go! You two, get over there. Evasive. Non-threat. Exit clear. We have no visual indication, that any incoming artillery or ammunition have arrived or, indeed, are on the way. We can report the air raid sirens are going off. The military has been silent. Though a couple of hours ago, we heard a huge noise, and it was confirmed that four kc-1... Kc-135 supertankers had left the area. These are the planes that refuel... Other fighter planes and bombers... American bomber planes over the area so they're in the air. Hey- I'm trying to sleep, Larry. I had a bad nightmare. Really bad. God, I hate it when you smoke in bed. Oh, Jesus. Larry, what are you doing? Answer the phone. Yeah, hello? Yeah. What? When? Sanctuary. It isn't a robot we've been building, timms. It's a living organism. As project supervisor and the government liaison, it is my responsibility to use the strongest measures -available. - I listened timms, I've warned you about the aggression factors, for Christ's sake. He's just running the program we embedded. There you go. Survival imperatives are to be expected. I know all this Larry, it doesn't change a damn thing - no, we've got to get in there. - Obviously progressed to the next level. Self-activated reasoning. It had a plan. I need him alive, timms. It killed for real, Larry. Rosko 1138's mental capacity has been enhanced by neurotropic drug therapy. Inside the learning to thousands of times that of an ordinary chimpanzee. His mind has been programmed in virtual reality for deployment in battlefield environments too... Harsh for human soldiers. Jesus. His priorities are to identify and destroy the enemy, and... Survive. He has never applied these skills beyond the virtual reality simulation. So, we have no idea, of what he's gonna do! Threat. Hungry? I got some strawberries. Somebody in that tree? Take action. Targeting. Cyboman. What are you doing here? You're bleeding cyboman. Non-threat. Is that the bad guys? We could hide in my shed cyboman. Nobody could find you there. Come on, come on. You'll be safe in here. None of the flyovers have come up with anything yet. But we have to be ready to move swiftly, once our subject is spotted. Our priority is to contain this as quickly, and as quietly as possible. You know cyboman, if you want, you could, you could call me lawnmower man. Everybody does. Terry says, that's because i fix things and, and I mow lawns, better than anybody in the whole world. That's what Terry said. If you ever want anything fixed cyboman, I could fix it for you, okay? You know cyboman, if those bad guys come here... We can go into the church. You know who's in there? God. That boy was told to take care of this. He constantly shirks in his duties. We can't have these godless little creatures at the altar. It's sacrilege. Jobe! Jobe! Where are you boy? You're never here when you should be. You know what I got? I got all your best adventures. Yeah! All of 'em. This is the one I like, cyboman. See that? That's you. I can't read, but I look at all the pictures, and I know what you was doing. Cyboman you know, you're my hero. Are you hungry? Got it, thanks! Local police just got a strange call from the priest at St. Anthony's. Said there's some kind of weird animal at the church. - That's it, move your men out. - Let's go, hit it. Cyboman! We don't need all this artillery you can just take him out with a tranquilizer gun. Huh? Come on, timms, turn off your ego trip for god's sake. They're here, cyboman. They got father mckeen. All right guys, easy enough, please very easy. This is father mckeen, who placed a 911. He says there maybe someone in the building with the animal. Yes, jobe Smith, the church handyman. He resides in the shed. Jobe? Jobe Smith, the lawnmower man? - Yes - you know the guy? Yeah, he does my lawns. He's a local fixture around here. I don't have a backdoor. If I had a backdoor... Jobe's IQ couldn't be more than 45 or so. - Oh Jesus. - And he knows me, timms. So does rosco. Okay, I'll go in there. I'll get jobe out, all right? You just gotta promise me one thing. That I take rosco out alive, okay? What are we gonna do? Hello, jobe? Jobe,jobe,heâ€œo? Hello, this is Dr. Angelo. I live in sycamore Lane, and you do my lawns every week. He's Dr. Angelo. Now, listen to me now. You have a friend of mine in there. And... Could you and the friend just come over to the door please? Can you hear me? Those are bad guys with you, Dr. Angelo and they'll hurt him. And I don't want 'em to hurt him no more. Come on guys it's just a little chimp, easy. All right jobe, don't worry. Now listen, everything is okay, no one's gonna get hurt. Uh, he's bleeding you know. You can help him. Just take him over to the door... And I'll be right here. What are we gonna do, cyboman? Hey cyboman, could you use your invisible powers, huh? Come on, that's what we'll do. Okay jobe, nice and easy. All right everything's okay. Just cool it guys okay, just cool it. - Timms, weapon is visible. - Prepare to fire. No! No, don't shoot! No! No, rosco! No! God! No! Hold your tongue, boy! Hold your tongue. That was no ordinary animal. Everyone in this town knows you vsl people are involved in unnatural research up there. You get that thing off the grounds immediately! Excuse me, we need to take him with us for some questions. You have no authority here! Jobe has been a ward of this church since he was five years old. In many ways, he still has the mind of a child, and I'm sure this experience has caused him serious damage. There will be no need to question jobe. We are so very sorry, that this happened here today, father mckeen, now, we will of course pay for any damages. I will see to it personally, that vsi makes a large contribution to the church. - Tithing is a blessed act. - And father as far as what happened here today, i hope I can have your agreement to create as little publicity as possible. Come on, jobe. Oh, rosco. All right. Let's clean up this mess, before the whole yahoo town comes around snapping pictures. Right. Let's clean it up. What happened out there today was truly the work of the devil. But the lord and I cannot tolerate disobedience jobe. What you did out there today, endangered this church! You're not to tell anybody what happened. Not even Terry? Not even my drunken brother Terry! No one! So evil! Which of... God's lessons help you to remember best, jobe? I won't tell. Whipping] Booting audio journal. Recording. Journal entry. May first, 9pm. The lowest point in my career. Amend that... Lowest point in my life. A man is dead. Rosco's dead. Fucking bastards. Fucking, fucking bastards. I'm not kissing their asses anymore. Fuck! Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death, amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Big red. Oh, another hot one. It's gonna be a killer. It's a long way up here. Jobe! Jobe! Jobe, lad! Jobe! I feel like you live in the top of a tree. Come on, boy. Let's go grass is waiting for you. Oh, no. Did me brother have you doin' penance all night again? What did you do? Nothing. Okay, well... It's okay, jobe boy. It's okay. It's me, Terry. Come on. Here. Go get a shirt on, then we'll go, okay? What have we got here? Well... Oh, my god, would you look at this! You finished big red. Yeah. Aye, you're magic with a machine, boy. Look at this. Could we try it? Try it today, Terry? I don't see why not. You have had incredible success, man, no one is saying stop. I know... That's why I'm quitting. I've been sucking on the military tit for too long, I've got a sour taste in my mouth. I wanna make something better than a military weapon, timms. I'll just find funding in the private sector, that's all. You're not thinking straight, Larry. - Oh? - You signed iron clad non-disclosures. Vsl owns it all. Besides, it might not be the healthiest thing to try. They own me? Is that it? Is that what you're saying? What, the company will rub me out the shop if I don't comply? You're being paranoid. Larry, look, relax. I know you're upset because of what happened with-- relax? They want to suppress my work! The potentials for human advancement are endless! Virtual reality holds a key to the evolution of the human mind and that's my focus! This is something... And we haven't had something for a while. There will be time for all this, Larry. You just have to play the game a little longer. That is how everything finally gets done in this world. Look, why don't you take a hiatus, and we'll restructure around here? You can use the rest. Hmm. Take a hiatus? Go fill up the gas can, jobe. Get me a candy bar. Hey pop, could you move that shit before Christmas? Fill her up. Hey, Jake, that's dangerous. You forget who you're talking to, half-wit? That's dangerous. You son of a-- jobe! Jobe boy, go ahead and finish what you're doing. - He's smoking, Terry. - That's right. I'm smoking. Why don't you shut the fuck up and fill your gas tank? Jakeâ€œ. He don't mean no harm. - You fucking cunt! - Jake, how's your old man doing? Worse than ever! I gotta do everything around here, everything! - I gotta wash the pump-- - Jake here, this is the nectar of the gods. Ed. Terry, Jake. Ah, fuck you, ed. Say what's this i hear about a big ruckus up, at St. Anthony's, yesterday? A bunch of cops or something? - Cops, you say? - Yeah. Well, I don't know. Jobe! Jobeâ€œ. Anything strange going on over at the church yesterday? Yeah! Even heard something about a wild animal. They killed him. Killed him, killed who? Cyboman! Cyboman? Shit! He came to see me at my shed. - Comics, right? - Yeah, cyboman. - He came to see me. Uh-huh. - He came to see you? - At your shed? - Yeah he came to see him at his shed. - He did. - He did! Sure he did. Angelo is like all brilliant types: Erratic. But we tolerate them at the shop, as long as they perform. And Angelo, has certainly done that. Project 5 is very impressive. Mr. director, without Angelo, there is no project 5. Well, he'll be back. One way... Or another. Falling. Rapid descent. Flying- god damn it, Caroline. Never unplug a program when I'm engaged. You just ruined the whole effect. Falling, floating, and flying? So, what's next, fucking? What are you pissed off about? You said you were going to take me to the city this weekend. But as usual, you're hooked up into that machine. Well, why didn't you remind me? I did. Oh, babe, I'm sorry. Oh, Caroline. I'm sorry. This is not a good time for me right now. I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry. Get ready. We can still get a hotel. We don't need to go anywhere I'm ready right now. Larry, I want to go. I don't feel like being around people right now. I don't feel like going to the city. You never want to go anywhere. I need your support. I'm going through a lot of changes right now. Well, I'm going through a lot of changes, too. You're too obsessed with your work to even notice. I'm young, Larry. Okay? And I'm not going to become a recluse just for you. I'm into reality reality, not this artificial reality. Caroline... This technology is going to change the world. This is the future... And you're afraid of it. Yeah well, it may be the future to you, Larry but it's the same old shit to me. I give up. Hey, jobe! Hey! Hey! Hi, Peter! - You've finished big red. - Yeah! Hi, jobe. Hi, Mrs. parkette. Come over and have some kool-aid with Peter when you're done. Yeah, okay. Thanks, mom! Peter, look what I got you. All right. The nuke masters special edition! Yeah. It's 3D, too. All right. But where are the glasses? Glasses? That's okay. I've got a pair of my own anyway. Look at the blades, man. If you boys listen real careful, you can hear the panpipes of the little people in the grass there. - Right, Terry. - I hear them all the time. Hi, Dr. Angelo. Can we play in cyber-boogie today? Yeah, sure. That would be fine. Damn. Peter! Get your ass over here! I got to go. Hi, dad. Peter, I told you not to leave that fucking bike in my way! Didn't I? - Didn't I? Didn't I? - I'm sorry, dad. What is wrong with you? Didn't I tell you not to play with that moron anymore? You want to get stupid? Get in the house. I'm tired of this shit. Come on. Why did rosco bond with this retarded man, I mean he is little more than a six year old's mentality for Christ's sake. Maybe it was his... Purity, that drew him to the chimp... I can only hyspoth... I can only... Pothesize. With rosco dead, I'll never know for sure. I'm going out with the girls, Larry. - I just need to have some fun. - Okay. You know, drinking all that whisky, isn't going to help your depression. You know it's probably gonna make it worse. Yes, you're right, Caroline. It is probably going to make it worse. You have no idea of what I'm going through, do you? They've got me boxed in, and there's nothing - I can do about it. - Well if there's nothing you can do about it, then why don't you just give up? Goodbye, Larry. That's it, Caroline. Caroline? Caroline? Caroline, look I've apologized, I've said I'm sorry, what more do you want me to say? Every time it's the same. Come on, please give me a break. Caroline? Caroline? - Hi. - Hi. How are you? Looks like you've had one of those days too. I wouldn't say that it was the best of days. Oh, I hope Peter hasn't been bugging you too much? Oh, no, no, he's wonderful. I adore him, he's a great boy. I mean he's wild for all the computer stuff that you do. He reminds me of myself at that age. Insatiable curiosity and cunning. I wish I had a little boy like Peter. Have one! I think you'd make a really good father. I work too much. Well you borrow Peter, whenever you want. Sounds good. Well goodnight, doc. Goodnight. Here you go. Right down there. Jobe. Tell her what you want. Cheese burger, please. - French fries? - Yeah okay- chicken fried steak's the special, Terry. Hi, guys. Hey jobe, what's happening? New issue of kung fu cyborgs came in. Uh oh. I don't want these guys to visit me. They're bad. They're bad! Come here, you noodle brain. Freakin' retard. Comic books... Cyboman, it's all shit! Now I tell you if I was ten years younger I'd take his head off. Jobe! Jobe man, get up. There you go. - He scared me, Terry. - I know he did. That was the devil himself, you'll be all right. Recording. Oh... Jesus. This hiatus is just driving me insane. When I think of what i might have accomplished, with a human subject. I've got to find a way to continue the work on my own. There's so much to do. I can't wait any longer. Full. Hi, jobe. - Hi, Dr. Angelo. - How are you? - Looks like you're working hard. - Yeah, I'm a real hard worker. Jobeâ€œ. - Do you like to play games? - Yeah. Peter says you have the best games. Well, I have a game in my house that you might like to play. Would you like that? Yeah, okay. Okay- okay now, jobe. Now, remember, one of the four shapes on the bottom row, you see them down there? Matches one of the shapes on the top row. So, put your finger on here... And move that shape... To the question mark, all right? Incorrect. Try again. Try again, okay, here we go. - There. - Incorrect. Don't worry. Don't worry. Take your time. Take your time. Here we go. Correct answer. Yeah! - You did it. Very good. - Let's play another game. On! Peter, come here! I'm going to get you, Peter. - All right. Let's go. - Look at that! Watch out! Holy moley! Come on, Peter. Slow down. I'm going to hit the wall. I'm getting dizzy. Peter, wait! Come on, Peter. Come on back. Peter, I'm getting dizzy. Game over. Peter... Why don't you go upstairs and get some drinks? Hey, jobe. It's okay. It's just a game. I was really bad. Well, you'll get used to games. Thanks, Peter. Hey, jobe. Hey- I was flying upside-down, Dr. Angelo. Come on. Hop up. Come over here... Sit down. You know, jobe... I have other... Different games. I even have one that could help make you smarter. I was born dumb. But... You would like to be smarter, wouldn't you? I don't know. Well, if you were smarter, people wouldn't be able to... Take advantage of you. Do you understand what I mean, jobe? - Yeah. - And? Sometimes they do. They do. Can you keep a secret? Yeah. Well... I'll tell you one. I can make you smarter... But only if you want. And you must never tell anyone. You mean a secret for just you and me, too? That's right. Re-modeling? I think you might have over estimated jobe's capabilities and you know, he works full time as a landscaper, and he has certain obligations -to the church. - Listen, I can assure you that he'll be under constant supervision... And of course, I'll be making a contribution to the church, well, I need the write off. Well, I'll talk to my brother Terry, and see if he can work jobe part time, it would only be Christian to try to help you, Dr. Angelo. Well, I bet you already know, don't you? So don't you tell anybody, okay? Okay- well, you're as healthy as a mule. When can we play the games? Soon, jobe. I... need to give you a shot of vitamins first. I had a shot once, Dr. Angelo, and it hurt! This won't. Trust me. I'm very good at this. That looks like a gun! Okay, just relax your arm. Relax your arm. Relax. Look over there. Look over there. It didn't hurt. Just relax. Your head's going to be a blank for a while. All right? Yeah. Okay, just breathe now. - Too dark! - No, not gonna be in a while. Just breathe and relax. That's it. In a while, it's going to be like being up there with the stars, jobe. Like going to another planet. You're gonna feel a little tingling sensation in your hands, but... Don't panic. It's okay. I'm right here with you. It's all part of the game. Okay, here we go. Cortex stimulation engaged. - Brain stem strobe enabled. - Is that my hand? It's going to hit me! No, it's not going to hit you! Just relax. Just breathe. Strobe velocity increasing. Journal entry, may 10th. The electrochemistry of his brain has responded better than I'd expected. I'm going to step up the virtual treatments and increase the dosage of nootropic drugs. I should see escalations in his brain patterns by the end of the week. It's too late to turn back now. Jobe, what's the matter? I'm hungry- well, go eat. His mind is like a clean, hungry sponge. Synaptic activity has increased 400% in less than a month. His human brain is responding to the nootropics... And virtual stimulation more rapidly than my animal subjects. Even rosco. Seizure pattern detected. Jesus Christ! God, jobe! Jobe, jobe, jobe. (Timon, dmon. It's okay, it's okay. Okay, relax. I'm here, you alright? - Yeah. - Yeah? You sure? - Yeah. - Okay. Alright. That's it, just relax, let me get these gloves off you. C'mon. I'm hungry- seizure was mild... If I can keep panic control over the stem flow... I should be able to prevent it from happening again. The results have been so exciting otherwise... I must continue the treatments. What's that you're reading there, jobe? Looks a little strange. This is exercise for my brain, Terry, to make me smarter. Did you know that the square of the hype... Let me see that. Let me see that! I'll tell Dr. Angelo that you're here to work and not to read books! No wonder you've been so difficult lately! Let the boy have his book, Francis. It's not gonna hurt anything, you're such a pious asshole. Great effort has kept him on the straight and narrow... I'll not have it undone. Well at least, he's trying to use his mind, let him be a man, he is one, you know. More drunken nonsense from you, Terry. What have you got to say for yourself, jobe? Nothing. You have to stand up to him, jobe, boy. For yourself! You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna teach you how to drive. - Today? - Today! A man's gotta know how to drive. Okay! Here Terry, you know that can make you smarter too! - Okay! - Yeah, what's this second word here? Tetrahedron! Go on, go faster, Peter! Go on, I can catch you, right now! Yeah! Come on and get me, Peter! Come on! I'm going to get you now! Peter! You better not get too excited 'cause I'm getting you! Look, right there! Come on! '90!' You! Game over. Yes! You nailed it, jobe! - You nailed it! - Whoa, that was sketched. Finally, some real competition. Yeah, he got you that time, didn't he, Peter? Congratulations. You just graduated to the next level, jobe. Okay... Hi. You got a horse? What are you doing? Why are you standing there half-naked, exposing yourself? What sort of perverted behavior is this? You should knock before you come into somebody's house! This is my house. I pay the rent, I want to cash my checks now because I want to buy some new clothes. And I'm gonna buy some cowboy boots and I'm going to make this... place a ranch. It's that Dr. Angelo, isn't it? He's been feeding the devil in your head! No, he hasn't! I'll see to that. You know, you shouldn't hit people. You shouldn't hit people like that. Very impressive. Did you use the project 5 formulas and abstracts on this subject? Mm-hm. As a base. But I've totally reconfigured both the nootropic and the cyberlearning programs without aggression factors. Of course. That only makes sense. I can't believe you went ahead and did this, Larry. Look at the comparisons. It works with a human subject, timms. It's incredible work, Larry. So, what do you say? I've gone as far as I can in my lab at home. I need access to the main lab to go further. There's no telling how far I can take jobe. The shop's scrutiny is very tight. Jesus Christ, listen, all of humanity can benefit from this, for Christ's sake, all we gotta do is take the ball and run with it. - Very risky. -If we can keep them out of it long enough to get publishable results, then the lid will be off, and they won't be able to control the ramifications. I can't do this without your help. There might be a way. So, what's it going to be, Ms. Burke? Would you check my fluids, Jake? Do I know you? I mow your lawn. No! You're not the lawnmower man. Well... wow. You've certainly changed. I don't know how you did it, but I approve. Ms. Burke, I filled her up with trans fluid. No charge. Thanks,jake. You're welcome. Well, I'm looking forward to having my lawn mowed... Soon. She's got the hots for you, jobe boy. You got to be kidding me. She's just teasing this half-wit. Look at him. You got him dressed up like a fool! I've known her ever since her husband died. She's been kicking up her heels with all young studs in town. And I tell you, she wants this young fella. Don't you call her no whore around me, old man. Whores do it for money. She's got money. She's young. She does it 'cause she likes it. I told you to shut up. Hey, Jake, don't do that! Okay, lawnmower man. Dr. Angelo, I think people can tell that... That I'm changing. Just don't draw attention to yourself, okay? I mean, just keep doing the lawn job for now. It's not going to last forever. I like doing the lawns. - That's good. - I always liked doing them. That's good. Are you gonna do to me what you did to the chimp? Well, yes and no. I mean, I'm-- I'm drawing from that research, but you know, it's gonna be different, it's... it's... it's... Gonna be different. They're not gonna kill me too? Jobeâ€œ. I have only one goal for you, that's to make you the best you can be, do you understand that? Yeah? Now unfortunately, there was another agenda with the chimp, they tried to create a kind of, uh, a kind of soldier. - A soldier? - Yeah, I mean, the whole thing was a mistake, i shouldn't have got involved. A soldier for war? Things went wrong. You're cleared. Go ahead. Why is this place so far from town? The work here at vsi is government classified... Top secret. Oh, okay. Good afternoon, Dr. Angelo. It's like a dungeon in here, Dr. Angelo. Yep. You see this, jobe? - Holy moley! - Jobe? Jobe? Come on. It's okay. It's okay. This is some of the most advanced computer equipment in the world, jobe. In these gyrospheres, we wear full cybersuits, which allow us to enter into virtual reality and move. Your entire nervous system and endocrine system will be in sync with the brain expansion. Endocrine? Endocrine, it carries secretions of certain glands like the thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary, which regulate growth. Sometimes... I think I've discovered a new planet... But one I'm inventing instead of discovering. I've just sighted the shore of one of its continents. Booting biology systems readouts. Bio-monitors on. Choice. Graph five... engage. Change brain wave parameters. Brain wave pattern altered. Prepare brain stem injection. Initiate brain stem. Insertion complete. Let me off! Dr. Angelo! Synaptic reaction positive. My head, Dr. Angelo! I like it! Change brain wave parameters. Initiate second level. Insertion complete. Lemonade... ...lemonade... ...think he likes lemonade? It's so hot today, jobe. Why don't you come up for a cold glass of lemonade? Oh, Jesus, mother of god, would you look at that? Jobeâ€œ. Go on, you dolt! Go on! Jobe, have you ever kissed a girl before? - No. - No? Really? Give me your tongue. Give me your tongue. - Soft. - Yeah. Hard. Yeah! I think we should stop the vr treatments for a while, jobe, I don't wanna risk another seizure. Why? Dr. Angelo, I told you i feel okay, I really do, as a matter of fact i feel better than I ever felt in my whole life, I really do. Maybe, jobe, but, you know, i just think we should back off for a while and get down -to the good old basics. Okay? - Basics? What basics? Totally interactive virtual teaching, we've got everything here, from philosophy to mathematics, to... art, science... as you can see, the chair takes you into the console. Okay, we'll start with... The history of civilization. What's this? This is a-- this is an eye tracker... Put this on your head like that and use that in unison, with this. - Hey, just like in your house! - This is called a flying mouse, you use this to click into the circuit. Choose now. And here's the agent, and he'll take you -through the subject, okay? - Yeah, okay. When you finish with that one, then just go into the next. - Okay. Okay. - I'll be back in a few hours. Okay. Bye. I never realized it was so complex. So disturbing. What's wrong, jobe? What's disturbing? History, Dr. Angelo. History is disturbing... Provides us with a background, a context to why things are the way they are... So many... Great men and women... So many noble causes, and so much tragedy. How many did you go through? I went through the whole series up to the American revolution. That's 100 hours of programming. Yeah, I figured how to increase bot ratings, it took only two minutes. But jobe... No one can have comprehension and retention at that speed, no one. I did, Dr. Angelo... Matter of fact, I think my retention is better at a higher speed. Normal speed was only putting me to sleep. That's impossible. Do you wanna test me? Alright. Alright. That's amazing. One hundred percent accuracy. Sweet Jesus! At this rate, you can assimilate a phd in two days. I want to, Dr. Angelo, i want more discs. I want more information on everything. There's a lot to be said for slower absorption. What? Like, reading a good book. Taking time to grapple with the thoughts and concepts you're exposed to, not like memorization, jobe. Dr. Angelo, I'm not just memorizing, my mind is blazing, it's filling with information. What I've learned in virtual reality, makes books obsolete, it only makes sense. This is the technology that transformed me. They're not gonna believe this. Rhythm and blues. You like it? Yeah, sure. I like it. Classical! You should try listening to a whole tune once. You might like it. Nah, too much to hear! I get it all by sampling segments, anyway. Who taught you how to drive? "Me! {Both laugh] There you go. Enjoy yourselves. Jim, you need anything else? - Hi, Dolly! - Hi, jobe, I'll be right with you. Don't you want to check out the comics first? I gave them up, Peter. - No way! - Yeah! Matter of fact, I got my collection in that crate in the back of the truck, I'm giving it to you. Whoa, awesome! Dudical! - Order me fries and coke, right? - Okay. Yeah! Jobe... Are you all right? Jobeâ€œ. I don't got time for this... I hope he doesn't puke on the counter... What's wrong with that fool? ...he's probably been taking dope. Look at that guy! Whatever the hell is his problem? Probably dancing with the booze lady. He's having a breakdown... ...oh, man! Are you all right, jobe? Peter, I got to go. Is doctor-- ls Dr. Angelo home? Yeah, he is. Asshole's probably jacking off with his computer... The things that people think. Had to use all my concentration to block it out, I don't want it to happen again, because if it does, i think I would go crazy. It's amazing. Even with treatments stopped, your abilities continue to change and grow. I speculated that if psychic powers existed this research would be the key to unlocking them. But this is beyond anything I ever expected. I mean, like the accelerated learning. I mean, the results are completely unexpected. Completely. Okay, okay. Well, don't worry, jobe. I'll sort something out. I'll sort something out. I've got to keep this psychic development quiet, especially from timms. Who's timms? He absorbed Latin yesterday in less than two hours. It took me a year just to learn the Latin alphabet. God damn, Larry, I am speechless. I think it's time we brought this out of the closet and report these results directly to the department of scientific intelligence in Washington. Dsi is bound to offer you both tits. The timing isn't right. There's some factors that need ironing out. Well, iron them out. I'm not going to be able to keep this quiet much longer, Larry. I'm preparing Angelo to present his results to you personally, as you've requested. He's met with incredible success. Precisely why we feel it's time for you to guide his efforts in a specific direction. Which direction is that? We're most anxious to see what effect the original project 5 formulas will have on this subject. Mr. director, if you remember the aggression vectors in project 5 caused-- that was an ape, timms. We want to know what effect it will have on a human subject. It's an essential step for us to determine certain covert sector applications for Angelo's work. It will be difficult in the extreme... To convince Angelo to reinstate the original formulas. Well... Then you'll have to be persuasive... in the extreme. Run batch five-five. Program change initiated. Initiate brain stem. Brain wave pattern altered. Warning. Jobe, can you hear me, jobe? Relax. Shut down theta stimulation. I'm coming over. Stay there, stay there. Warning. Endocrine, adrenal increasing to fatal levels. System shutdown. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon... - It's okay, it's okay. - I saw god! I touched god! I was pushing, I was pushing. I didn't even think of jobe's safety. That amount of brain swelling should've killed him. Instead, it disappeared, leaving no lesions. Somehow the experiment is out of my control. I'm stopping the treatments until I can figure out what went wrong. You trying to sneak up on me, Dr. Angelo? I doubt that I could. - How you doing? - I've synergized a tremendous amount of data and you and I have proven, that most functions of the brain are simply lying dormant, waiting to be awakened. Esp talent isn't necessarily a dormant function, jobe... Fairly large percentage of the populous is exhibit it, to one degree or another. I've just scanned a study where a group of researchers were able to raise blisters on the bodies of hypnosis subjects, purely through auto suggestion. We're a long way off from thinking to physical manifestations. Maybe not as far as you think, Dr. Angelo. You think I'm moving too fast. That's why you stopped the drug treatments and the virtual stimulation. Have Patience, jobe... Have Patience. Scientific investigations are a tedious process, just reach the platinum, that's all. Confessions. Eavesdrop on real people telling their innermost secrets, darkest desires... I saw this woman today... I couldn't help myself. â€œV announcefl 1-900-420-9090 god, he smells good... ...i want to get him up for something strange tonight... I can read your mind. Oh, right. You sure have some strange fantasies. Come with me. ...let's live a little... Jobe, it's so huge in here. This will be the best ride of your life, marnie. You're the best ride of my life. In here, we can be anything we want to be. I'll see you on the inside. Wow! It's my hands! Look at this! Oh, my god! Jobe, where are you? I'm right here, marnie. Come over here. You're beautiful. It's from our primal mind. I don't like it, so let me up. Jobe, let me up! Now! No. Nothing can hurt us in here. Jobe, you're scaring me. I want out! I know what you really want, marnie, watch this. Oh, my god! What are you doing? Jobe, what are you doing? What are you doing? Oh, my god, let me up! No! Oh, god! Warning, brain pattern abnormal. Automatic system shutdown. Marnie! Mamie, mamie, are you okay'? Marme'? Mamie. Marnie, I couldn't stop. It's done. Dr. Angelo said nothing could happen. I didn't mean to hurt you! What did Dr. Angelo do to me? I have to find out. I can't fly to fucking Washington tomorrow! I told you. I have to resolve some problems before presenting my work. This is premature. I'm not ready. - You're ready enough. - Oh, shit. Be reasonable. I can't keep this secret any longer. We can't cut ourselves off from the hand that feeds us. I thought you were doing lawns today. I wish I were. Mind over matter, Dr. Angelo. Not a miracle. A fact. I have to run some tests. Get a clearer picture. This is all so new. It's not new. I realize that nothing we've been doing is new. We haven't been tapping into new areas of the brain. We've just been awakening the most ancient. This technology is simply a route to powers that conjurers and alchemists used centuries ago. Human race lost that knowledge and now I'm reclaiming it through virtual reality. You're moving too fast. Even with these new abilities, there are dangers. Man may evolve a thousandfold through this technology but the rush... Must be tempered with wisdom. No. No. You're trying to get inside my head, jobe. I can feel you pushing. You realize, Dr. Angelo, that my intelligence has surpassed yours... And I can't allow your fear of what you don't understand -to get in the way of this work. - Oh, dear god. The treatments have to continue. We have no choice. I was terrified of him. I'm sure he knew it. He surpassed me, all right. But his insights seem... Twisted. I fear for jobe's sanity. This Washington trip couldn't come at a worse time. We have a change in our itinerary. What are you saying, timms? We're not going to Washington? We're not going to dsi? A shorter flight, actually, you'll be presenting your results to a branch of dsi in Virginia. You mean the shop? Now you promised me they wouldn't be involved. Driver! Turn the car around, will you please? - Play the game, remember? - Oh, fuck you! - Calm down. - Fuck you! So as you can see, the results with this one human subject indicate unlimited applications in the area of mental disability alone. Such as retardation, Alzheimer's... And of course, the possibilities for education in general are staggering. With the proper funding, we could perfect this within the year. Any questions? The director wants to know if you've noticed any significant changes since the project 5 formula was reinstated. We only reinstated those formulas a few days ago. Not enough time for any findings. Wait a minute. What are you talking about? I was going to speak with you about this after the meeting. The shop requested that we resume the original batch five with jobe. You idiot. You goddamn idiot! Do you know what you have done? There is no telling what the project 5 abstract will do to a human being, do you understand me? What project 5 will do to a human is exactly what we want to find out, doctor. You know what it did to Roscoe 1138 and he was the most advanced chimp we ever had! Before that, there were two other chimps, who got into fits of rage so severe, that they tore each other apart! That's it, isn't it? It's always like that with you guys. It only leads to one thing... War. Why didn't you include the development of jobe's other abilities in your report, Larry? Don't look so shocked. You may have tried to hide it, but I have witnessed what your new formulas, not batch five, have done to your human subject. I've had enough. Make sure he goes back to the hotel. What other abilities? Your behavior cost us a lot of ground tonight. I had to talk for hours to repair the damage. My behavior? You fucking sycophant. You've been lying to me all along. - For security reasons. - Piss off! Look, without the shop's financial involvement this project wouldn't exist. Then maybe it shouldn't. I hate to be the one to break it to you, Larry, but the concept of dirty money went out when the catholic church got into banking 300 years ago. It's all dirty money. For Christ's sake, don't let some juvenile ethics problem get 'm your way-. Your research is too important. Okay... You'll be more realistic in a few days. They're going to pick up jobe and bring him here. The director wants a personal demonstration of his... progress. They're not going to get jobe. There's no walking away, Larry. All right. Let's get him. Yes, sir. Shit! They're here to pick me up as well. Right, timms? You can't leave! You're integral to the project! Oh, shit! Good evening sir, may I help you? Uh, yeah, I'd like a car, right away, please, anything you got, I'll take it. - There you go. - I believe everything is out, but maybe there's been a return -since I last checked. - Okay, you check it. Fucking leave me alone and find him! There's a sub-compact available, will that do? That's fine, I'll just walk over the lot and pick it up, okay? If you like, let me just print this out and we'll get you on your way, sir. I'm sorry, I can't wait, I'm sorry. Mr. Angelo! You forgot your car... Mr. Angelo. It's too much! - Oh, shit! Jesus. - I'm shocked, Dr. Angelo. You're gonna have to come with me. Excuse me. What do I do with this? Cover him, cover him. Devil in your head. Who you talking to, half-wit? Which of god's lessons... I told you not to play with that moron. Devil in your head! Hey,hey! Shit! Well... there's no need to panic, timms. We know where he's going. We'll send a grab team in tomorrow. And pick them both up at once. I want you to get back there. Cancel Angela's clearance at vsi. We don't want him stealing his work, now, do we? I'll let you know what the next step is... After we've had a chance to examine jobe Smith. ...give me strength that I might prepare the way for those who will not follow... - Who's there? - Hail Mary, full of grace... Who is it? Who's there? The church is closed for the night. Come back tomorrow. I'll hear your confession. I've come for your confession. Jobeâ€œ. I don't want you here tonight, jobe. Leave me alone. Get out of here. The good father mckeen. Took in the poor idiot nobody wanted. What have you done? The devil's taken you. Judgment day is here! Forgive me, father, for I have sinned. They're impatient for you. I have unclean thoughts, but deliver me. In hell! I've used thy name in profane fantasies. I have committed cruel acts of molestation. Be done! What are you doing here? What, you going to do some night mowing? You're a strange motherfucker... And I am too tired for this, lawnmower man. So why don't you take your silly ass and go trick-or-treating or something? Shit! Fuck! Shit! Get away! Okay, okay! Don't hurt me. Please. Lawnmower man's in your head now, Jake. There's no escape, ever. Stop taking his side, Carla, you're treating him like a little girl! I'm so sorry, Peter. Why is dad getting so bad? I don't know, baby. He's sick. Damn kid's toys. If, in fact, that occurs, it would mean he is one of the select few, who has been in every wrestlemania, all seven of them. Talk about talented! How long would Bobby last south of the border? What's that noise? Help me! You are going to die! Hold on. All right. Come on through. Hell of a thing. Hell of a thing. Uh, hello, lieutenant. I'm Dr. Angelo. I live next door. - What's happened here? - Oh, thanks for coming over. You saved a trip. We're taking statements from all neighbors, just to see if they saw or heard anything unusual. There's a little boy. His name is Peter. Has anything happened to him? Oh, no, he's fine. It's just his dad-- excuse me, lieutenant. Where's the rest of him? Birdbath. - Did you say the birdbath? - Birdbath. Lieutenant, the wife and the kid, they're getting ready to go down to the station. Said they slept through the whole thing. Didn't hear or see anything. Didn't hear anything. The lab boys tell me that somebody chased parkette, through the house with a power lawnmower. I would have thought that would have made some racket. Crazy with the heat. Schiz-0-fucking-phrenia all over town last night. What else happened last night? Well, somebody torched poor old father mckeen with a flamethrower or something. Must have been a Satan cult or something. Either that or that weird human spontaneous combustion thing. That really happens sometimes. Hell of a thing. - My god. - That's not all. Marnie Burke was found this morning wandering around the street stark naked, laughing her ass off, flipped out. The psychiatrist figured she'd probably witnessed one of the murders, and she's just in shock, but I've seen people flipped out before, and this girl was flipped out for good. I don't believe she'll ever stop laughing. Two bizarre murders in one night. Well, this world is chock full of nuts, cooley. Don't forget that. Weirdos, schizos, bozos. Well... Accidents happen. That's all there is to it. Two bizarre accidents in one night. Accidents? You were just calling them murders. Oh, no, no, we'll just file a routine report. Just clean and tidy. Larry? Oh, Peter, come here. Come here. It's okay, son. It's okay. How did this happen? It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Hi, darling. I've been cooking for you all day. Would you like something from the oven? Caroline, where's jobe? Caroline? Caroline, where's jobe? Jobe? Jobe? Jesus Christ, jobe! Jesus, come on. Jobe. I gave myself a boost, doctor. Virtual reality is not just a simulation, it's a whole other world. A new electric dimension. Utopia, doctor. The utopia that men have dreamed for a thousand years and I'll be the conduit! - Jobe? - You wanna create monsters. You killed two people, jobe. Why? You gotta let me help you. Help me? I'm going to help you, Dr. Angelo. I'm gonna help all of you cleanse this diseased planet. This technology has peeled back a layer to reveal another universe. Virtual reality will grow... Just as the telegraph grew to the telephone... As the radio to the TV... It will be everywhere. You're having delusions, jobe. Struggle for reason. I'm going back to vsi... To complete the final stage of my evolution. I'm going to project myself into the main frame computer. I'll become pure energy. Once I've entered in the neural net... My birth cry will be the sound of every phone on this planet ringing in unison. Listen to what you're saying. The first sign of psychosis is a Christ complex. Cyberchrist. Please listen to me, jobe, okay? The project 5 abstracts that you were exposed to were never meant for the human mind. You've had a psychotic break! Let me try to reverse that. What are you blocking? You can't hide anything from me, Dr. Angelo. So the shop is coming to pick me up... And you've betrayed me, haven't you? Jobe! Do you boys need anything? Caroline, snap out of it-- fucking bastard. I'd like to proceed to Angelo's residence, sir. Very well. Leave the Van's cameras on transmit. I want to monitor from here. Yes, sir. Angela's. Now you can witness the impossible, Dr. Angelo. Good evening, ma'am, I'm here to see Dr. Angelo, is he in? Yes, he is. I'll get him for you. No! What the hell? I'm going back to vsl now, and once I'm inside the mainframe, I'll have access to over 5,000 other databases. And from those 5,000, I can reach out again and again and again... Eventually inhabiting the entire planetary network. By the year 2001, there won't be a person on this planet, who isn't hooked into it... And hooked into me. I'm sorry you hate... What you have created. Right, jobe. I'll be right there. The good Dr. Angelo has been working on something else behind our backs. He's developed a fantastic new energy weapon. I've observed a demonstration. It's very advanced. I want you to gather his research... All disks, hard copies, everything... Erase the files from the mainframe there, then transport it all here, personally. No, i-- I can't believe it. Not Angelo. Not a weapon. He is totally opposed. Believe it, timms. He took out two of my men in a way... I've never seen before. I sure have been missing you, jobe. Peter, where are you going? Peter, I want you to come right back. Jobe, jobe, wait up! Jobe! Dr. Angelo? Hey. Dr. Angela? Dr. Angelo? Peter! Peter! Peter! I told him to come down here and pick me up after work. - Hey. What's going on here? - What the fuck? Hey, what did you open the gate for? We didn't. Some kind of malfunction. That's it. The back. That's it. Can you do it? Did the same guy that killed my dad get to you? Yes, Peter. I'll explain it all later. Go upstairs and tell your mother to call the police. Don't worry. Go on quickly, go. Quickly, go! Erasing 261 y 8k. Confirm erase? There's a little problem with the main gate. It opened by itself, and it won't close. Send everything you've got down to the main gate. - Right. - Now! Welcome to vsi mainframe. Please enter passcode. - Analyzing. Pass code cleared. - Got it! You have access to the network node. File 15 blocked. What is it? What's happening? Someone's hacking the mainframe from the outside. They're in, and they're running a computer virus that's placing triple key encryption codes on all outside access and network connections. What the fuck does that mean? We're being cut off. The main frame will be totally isolated in less than two minutes. Off the net. Something's wrong. I can't even get an operator. Jobe... Explosives. Okay... okay! Larry? What's going on? I can't explain now, but I need the keys to your car. - My car? - I understand. But I need to get to vsi, this is an emergency. - Jobe's there, isn't he? - Yes, Peter, jobe needs my help. - Why is jobe at vsi? - Carla, go get the car, now! Holy shit! I have to go now, Terry. Well, okay, jobe. No! No! What are you doing here? Leave me alone! I'll wait for you down the road. No, I want you out of here as fast as you can. Okay? But I want to go with you to find jobe. I understand, Peter. But I want you to stay with your mother, okay? Peter, get in the car. Larry, be careful! - We'll wait here, okay? - Okay. Jesus! Ln' iâ€œ. Ln' iâ€œ.! System overload. Automatic shutdown inoperative. Oh, my god, jobe. I can't believe this. Outside terminal activity control. No! Now to get out of here. Simple combination. Access denied. Access denied. Oh, jobe, what's happened? Jesus! He really did it. No. No, denied? No! Denied? Access denied. No! I must find a way out! I can't believe this! No! I must find a way out! I can't let you do it, jobe! You! Yes, me. You did this! You cut the network connections but I'll find a way out. All this power isn't meant to be in the hands of one person! You're wrong! You need to be led, just like everyone else. It's a basic need. This technology is meant to expand human communication, but you're not even human anymore. What you've become terrifies me. You're a freak! Your naive idiocy makes me very angry! Access denied. Access denied. This universe is mine. I am god here! Ha! I sense your thoughts. What are you hiding? The bombs. Jesus, the bombs. Bombs? - You forced me to. So you were willing to die? I'll stop them! You can't defuse the bombs, can you? You lost all your power over the physical world once you transferred in here. Stop! So you've given me one final game to play. I find a way out, or I die in this diseased mainframe. But that's not my destiny. I have things to do, people to see, a billion calls to make. You will die in the explosion! You're trapped. You're trapped in here, aren't you? You're trapped right here! Jobe? Peter! Peter is here. Jobe, he's in here. He's going to die! Jobe, please! Please, jobe! Don't sacrifice Peter. You and I have been responsible for so much destruction. What's happening? Dr. Angelo... jobe? I don't want more death. Go. Save him! Jobe, come back with me. Hurry! Peter? Peter? Peter? Access denied. Access denied. Help! I'm lost! Somebody! Peter! We've got to get out of here! The whole building's going to blow up! The door's locked! It won't open! Peter! - Jesus! - Open. Jobe. Oh, Peter. - Where's jobe? - Jobe's dead, Peter. So are we if we don't get out of here. Oh, no! Get down, Peter, quick! Get down, get down! Oh, god! Access denied. Access denied. There's got to be one. Let me in! Come on. Come on, quick! Quick! Peter, come on. Peter! Where is it? Access denied. Access denied. Maintenance line. Access granted. A back door! Ha ha! Get out of here! Go, now! July 10th. Last journal entry for a while. I won't let jobe's death be for nothing. What happened to him is my responsibility. For some reason, I've been given a second chance, so I'm taking my work underground. I can't let it fall into the wrong hands again. If we can somehow... Embrace our wisdom... Instead of ignorance... This technology will free the mind of man, not enslave it. We're ready. Good. They'll be here soon. Okay. Let's go.
