(RAIN PATTERING) (HORSE NEIGHS SOFTLY) (SOFTLY) Shh. Hey. Bathsheba Everdene. Bathsheba. The name has always sounded strange to me. I don't like to hear it said out loud. My parents died when I was very young, so there's no one to ask where it came from. I've grown accustomed to being on my own. Some say even too accustomed. Too independent. Miss! Miss! My scarf. I lost it. You must be Farmer Oak. Gabriel, yes. My aunt's told me about you. I'm working on her farm for the winter. This is your land. I'm trespassing. You're welcome here. Good afternoon, Farmer Oak. - Good afternoon, miss. GABRIEL: Come by, George. George, away! Enough, George! (YOUNG GEORGE BARKING) Enough! Stand. Stand. George, stand. (BARKING CONTINUES) Away! Away! George, away! He doesn't know when to stop, Young George. What's this one called? Old George. (BATHSHEBA LAUGHS) Old George. So you find me amusing, do you? Goodness, it's Mr. Oak! MRS. HURST: ...and after that she was gonna be a governess. But she was far too wild. Always has been. Oh! Miss... Bathsheba Everdene. I've brought you a lamb. Oh! (LAMB BLEATING) Thank you, Mr. Oak. He's such a dear thing. He's come too soon and won't last the winter, so I thought you'd like to rear it instead. Thank you, that's very kind. I'll make some tea. The lamb is not why I came. Go on. (CHUCKLES) Well, Miss Everdene, I wanted to ask... Would you like to marry me? I've never asked anyone before. (CHUCKLES) No. I should hope not. Well... Perhaps I, erm, I should... Perhaps I should leave. - Mr. Oak, there are things to consider! Is someone waiting for you? No, but that doesn't mean I'll marry you. Good day to you, then. Mr. Oak! Mr. Oak! Wait! I didn't say I wouldn't marry you, either. (PANTING) I haven't ever really thought about it. I have 100 acres and 200 sheep. If I pay off the money, the farm is ours. You could have a piano in a year or two. Flowers and birds... a frame for cucumbers. A baby or two. Mr. Oak...! - Or more! I will always be there for you. Mr. Oak, I don't want a husband. I'd hate to be some man's property. I shouldn't mind being a bride at a wedding if I could be one without getting a husband. That's stupid talk. You are better off than I, Mr. Oak. I have an education and nothing more. You could do much, much better than me. - That's not the reason. I'm too independent for you. If I ever were to marry, I'd want somebody to tame me and you'd never be able to do it. You'd grow to despise me. I would not. Ever. Good-bye, Miss Everdene. (OLD GEORGE WHINING SOFTLY) (YOUNG GEORGE BARKING OUTSIDE) (WHINING CONTINUES) (BARKING) (GROWLING) (SHEEP BLEATING) (YOUNG GEORGE BARKING) (OLD GEORGE BARKS) What is it, old boy? (WHINING) Stay here. Stay here, Old George. George! (YOUNG GEORGE BARKING IN THE DISTANCE) George! (DISTANT BLEATING AND BARKING) (BLEATING FRANTICALLY) (BARKING) (BARKING CONTINUES) No! (GUNSHOT) (THUD) It's all yours. We take no pleasure in this. BAILIFF: We wish you well, Mr. Oak. MRS. HURST: Bathsheba! What is it? My love. It's your poor uncle's will. What does it say? Read it. Read! He's left you everything. It's all yours! Oh! Oh, my goodness. Take care, you hear? Walk on. MRS HURST: Write! (INDISTINCT CHATTER) DOGGETT: So who will join us, lads? Which one of you fine boys will put on the scarlet uniform and proudly serve his Queen and country? See the world! Form an orderly line, gentlemen, at the front. This gentleman in the straw hat, step forward, sir. FANNY: That's my sweetheart, right there. DOGGETT: You, sir! Next to the pretty lady. There's a good strong figure of a man. Join us, sir. FANNY: Go on. You'd make a fine soldier. Always room in the ranks for a gentleman of your caliber. FANNY: It's a roof over your head. Food. DOGGETT: Who wants a fine wage? Excuse me. You might try Weatherbury. If you're looking for work, there's a farm there needs all the help it can get. I will. Thank you. - You should have a cloak for a day like this. FANNY: Francis will take care of me. We are to be married soon. Good-bye. DOGGETT: Come on! A decent wage! Make your family proud. Food, shelter! Who will join us? (DISTANT SHOUTING, INDISTINCT) (SHOUTING CONTINUES) FARMHAND 1: Go and wake up the other farms! Get them down here! We need more hands! FARMHAND 2: We need more men now! Wake them up! FARMHAND 1: Go and get the Smith brothers first. FARMHAND 3: Protect yourself, the fire's spreading! (FARMHANDS COUGHING) Who's in charge here? We're losing the ricks! (COUGHING) The rick is lost. We need to save the barn. Come on, help me! Come on, get some more water! Get some more water! (FARMHANDS CLAMORING) We need to push this out. Come on! Heave! ALL: Heave! Heave! GABRIEL: Heave, push! (MEN GRUNTING) (FARMHANDS CONTINUE SHOUTING) FARMHAND 1: Everybody out! Everybody out! FARMHAND 2: Water! More over here! The barn's going UP! FARMHAND 3: Get the sacks out, the root's about to go! (PANTING) What's he doing up there? OLDER MAN: We lose the barn, we lose everything. (PANTING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Look sharp, men, the farmer's here. Mr. Oak, is that you? Perhaps you want a shepherd, ma'am? I owe you an immense debt, Mr. Oak. If I'd have lost all of this, I'd have lost my farm. Your farm? My inheritance. My home, too, for a while when my parents died. When my uncle passed away, he left it to me. Of course, it's a little ragged now, but this once used to be the finest farm for miles. And I intend to make it so again. Perhaps you find the idea preposterous. I no longer have that luxury. I'm truly sorry to hear of your loss, Mr. Oak, but if our reversal of fortune causes you any embarrassment... - Not at all, ma'am. BATHSHEBA: Billy Smallbury? 9 and 8 pence. Joseph Poorgrass? WOMAN: Go on, Joseph. MAN: Go on, lad. (WHISPERS) Hat off. And what do you do, Joseph? I does general things. And in spring I shoot the rooks and help at pig killing, sir. (FAINT LAUGHTER) I mean ma'am. 7 and 9 pence. And another 9 because I'm new. Thank you, ma'am. Now, Fanny Robbin? Where is Fanny Robbin? Where is she? She's run away, ma'am. She's gone off with a soldier, ma'am. Not a soldier, a sergeant. Bailiff Pennyways? (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Here is 10 shillings and a further 10. (SOFTLY) Why? This ends our association. You are dismissed. I beg pardon, miss? When my uncle was alive, this was a fine, productive farm. Since his death, it has fallen into ruin. I can only assume... BAILIFF: Now see here, miss- I've resolved to have no bailiff at all, I've decided to manage everything. Mr. Pennyways, listen to me for a moment. A fire threatened to destroy the barn and you are nowhere to be found. I have no use for a man like you, Mr. Pennyways. You are dismissed. PENNYWAYS: Get out while you can, if I were you. (ALL MURMURING) Now you've all met our new shepherd, Mr. Oak. You understand your duties, Mr. Oak? If I don't, I'll ask, ma'am. From now on, you have a mistress, not a master. I don't yet know my talents in farming, but I shall do my best. Don't suppose, because I'm a woman, I don't know the difference between bad goings-on and good. I shall be up before you're awake. I shall be a-field before you are up. It is my intention to astonish you all. Back to work, please. (MURMURING RESUMES) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Perhaps I should wait here? No. Nonsense, Liddy. You're my companion. All of these? All of them. Head high, Liddy. If they stare, do not hesitate. (MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) Remember, we have as much right to be here as anyone. Good morning. (MEN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) (CHATTERING STOPS) Liddy, you'll lay things out. Yes, miss. Gentlemen, shall we get back to business? (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) There you go, sir. If you feel it, you can feel the quality. This is fine grain, miss. Thank you. Perhaps we should leave, miss. "But none of it as good as this lot." "It's good stuff, I'll grant you that." "Well, it's up to you. If you wanna go elsewhere..." "No, no, no." Farmer Stone? It's Miss Everdene. Farmer Everdene's niece. He talked about you with such great admiration. Of course, you're welcome to try elsewhere. I think you'll find the grain as good as it's ever been. (SNIFFS) Mr. Stone? - How much? ?5 a quarter. ?3-10 shillings. It's the same grain, Mr. Stone. You paid my uncle ?5. ?3-10. BATHSHEBA: This gentleman will pay me the proper price. MAN: Apparently not, no. ?4. ?4-10. ?4-05. Perhaps I should move on. Liddy, would you help me with this gentleman? Of course. Perhaps you'd like a sample? CUSTOMER: How much? - ?5 a quarter. MR STONE: Very well. ?4-10. (PEOPLE APPLAUDING) # Jerusalem the golden # With milk and honey blest # Beneath thy contemplation # Sink heart and voice oppressed LIDDY: He's rich, he's handsome. He sends the local girls mad. The Taylor sisters worked on him for two years. Jane Perkins spent ?20 on new clothes and might as well have thrown the money out the window. It's said, when he was young, his sweetheart jilted him. People always say that. Women don't jilt men. Men jilt us. Did someone jilt you, miss? Certainly not. A man did ask to marry me once. Some time ago. But I was too restless to be tied down. What a luxury, to have a choice. "Kiss my foot, sir, my face is for mouths of consequence." It wasn't like that at all. LIDDY: Why? Did you love him? No, but I rather liked him. Anyway, it's impossible now. Mr. Boldwood! Don't shoot me, please. I had no intention of shooting you. It's Miss Everdene. ...Your neighbor. ...Farmer Everdene's niece? I'm managing the farm alone now. Perhaps you've heard? Yes, I'm sure you'll do very well. Under the circumstances. Well, as you say, we're neighbors. LIDDY: Look what I've got here. What is it? LIDDY: Listen to this. "The rose is red, The violet blue "Carnation's sweet And so are you" It's a Valentine's card. I'm going to send it to Joseph Poorgrass just to see the look of panic on his stupid face. Poor boy. It's a little bit far-fetched, isn't it? What about Mr. Oak, then? No. Not Mr. Oak. LIDDY: Imagine if we sent it to Mr. Boldwood. Ignoring you like that, all high and mighty. BATHSHEBA: Mr. Boldwood? LIDDY: Perhaps not? - Why not? - Because I don't think he'll see the humor. (LAUGHING) Perhaps it's too much. Mr. Boldwood! - You're right. Perhaps it is. So we're gonna toss for it. - Liddy! - Come on. Open, Joseph. LIDDY: No, Jan Coggan. Open, Jan Coggan. Closed, Boldwood. (LIDDY YELPS) Sergeant Troy, 11:00. Yes, Sergeant Troy. And? Miss Fanny Robbin. Welcome. Step down the front. (CHOIR SINGING HYMN) (WHISPERS) Where is she? - I don't know. (DOOR OPENS) FEMALE PARISHIONER: Here she comes. DOGGETT: (WHISPERS) Sorry I'm late, old boy. Not long now. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight... (PEOPLE MURMURING) I can only wait a few more minutes. She'll be here. (WHISPERS) What do you think is happening? DOGGETT: I don't think she's coming, old boy. (SHEEP BLEATING) Come on. Go on, off you go. That's it. Go on. Morning, my love! Come on. (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Bring them in, John! GABRIEL: Grab this one. Miss Everdene's here now, so you better do your best work. I'm looking at you, Coggan. COGGAN: Yeah, you keep quiet, Liddy. (LAUGHING) What you doing? Perhaps you'd care to lend a hand? You don't think I would? No, you wouldn't. Come here. COGGAN: There, she's getting in. Come on! (ALL CHEERING) Well done, ma'am! LIDDY: Good morning, Mr. Boldwood. LIDDY: Miss Everdene? Mr. Boldwood wondered if he might have a word with you. Mr. Boldwood. Of course. WILLIAM: One thousand acres. A mix of arable and livestock. Adjacent to Everdene. An orchard. Glass house. I have some interesting pigs. (LAUGHS) Some other time, perhaps. Thank you. You have a very beautiful house. Mr. Boldwood? Miss Everdene. I want very much, more than anything, to have you as my wife. Miss Everdene, marry me. (STAMMERING) I... I feel, ahm... Though I respect you very much, I do not feel what would justify me in accepting your offer. I have known disappointments before, but I would never have asked in this instance had I not been, er, led to believe... Unless... Unless I am mistaken. BATHSHEBA: The valentine. No, you're not mistaken, but I should never have sent it. Forgive me, it was thoughtless to disturb your peace of mind. So you meant it as a joke? No. No, not as a joke. Not exactly. It was- impetuous. I see. Perhaps you think I am too old? But I will care for you more than anyone your own age. I'm sure you would... - I will protect you. You shall have dresses, a gig,... A piano! I amuse you? No. It's only... I have a piano. And I have my own farm. And I have no need for a husband, no matter how honored l am by the offer. I think I'd like to return home. Yes, er... I'll, er... I'll get someone to drive you. Mr. Boldwood, I've made you miserable. It was very wicked of me. Will you reconsider? Let me think. Yes. Yes, I'll give you time. I will wait. You're working late, Mr. Oak? Will you teach me? Here. Spin the wheel. Incline it, like that. And slide it gently. Spin the wheel. Bit faster. Like that. Very good. Now slide it. - I... It's... Getting stuck. I wanted to ask, did the men say anything today about Mr. Boldwood? They did. What did they say? That you'd be married before the end of the year. Come on. (CHUCKLES) Well, I'd like you to contradict it, to the men. Well, Bathsheba... "Miss Everdene," please. If Mr. Boldwood did really speak of marriage, I'm not going to tell stories just to please you. I said I wanted you to mention to the men it might not be true I was going to marry him. I could say that if you wish. But I could also give an opinion on what you've done. I dare say, but I don't want your opinion, Mr. Oak. I suppose not. Well, what is your opinion? That you're greatly to blame for playing pranks on a man like Mr. Boldwood. Your actions were unworthy of you. Unworthy? May I ask where my unworthiness lies? In rejecting you, perhaps? I've long given up thinking of that. Or wishing it, either. But I will say this: Leading on a man you don't care for is beneath you. I cannot allow a man to criticize my private conduct. You will please leave the farm at the end of the week. (METAL CLANGS) I'd prefer to go at once. Then go. I never want to see your face again. Very well, Miss Everdene. (DOOR SLAMS) (SHEEP BLEATING) Whoa, there we are. There. What's wrong with them? They broke fence and ate the young clover. Makes their stomachs swell. (BREATHING WEAKLY) BATHSHEBA: Well, what do we do now? JOSEPH: Nothing. The whole flock is blasted. You mean they're all going to die? Most probably. - Another one gone here, ma'am. Only one way of saving them. You must pierce their side with a tool. A hollow tube. Pricker inside. Well, can you do it? This one's still alive. No. Can I? - Oh, good Lord, no. One inch to the right or the left, and you kill the ewe for sure. Not even a shepherd can do it, as a rule. Well, who, then? (SIGHS) Gabriel! Gabriel! Gabriel Oak, wait! Miss Everdene needs you. Why are you alone? Did you find him? Yes, miss. So what did he say? He said... BATHSHEBA: Joseph? He said you're to go in person and request him civilly in a proper manner. Where does he get his airs? I'll do no such thing. He said you'd say that. He said to reply, "Beggars can't be choosers." (HORSE APPROACHING) (PANTING) Mr. Oak! Gabriel! Gabriel... Please don't desert me, Gabriel. I need your help. Make room for me. LIDDY: I wanna see. COGGAN: No, don't you start, Liddy, be quiet. GABRIEL: Find the spot. Between the ribs. Oh, Lord! - No,no,no,no,no. Now... LIDDY: I can see his heart beating. (AIR HISSING) - Come on. COGGAN: Come on, girl! GABRIEL: Come on. She'll be all right. You all right, Pixie? Yeah, come on. (BLEATING) Hey Pixie! Pixie! (LAUGHTER) Hey! Come here! (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (BLEATING) (COGGAN WHISTLING) JOSEPH, SINGING: Lay me low Lay me low Where no-one can see me Where no-one can find me Where no-one can hurt me. (ALL CHEERING) Get out. Please, quiet. "Oh, early one morning As I was a-walking" "The fields and the meadows They looked so green and gay" "The birds sang so sweetly" "So pleasant and so charming" "So early in the morning" "At the break of day." - Miss! Mr. Boldwood is here. Thank you. Thank you, Jan. Jan, thank you. (APPLAUDING AND CHEERING) BATHSHEBA: Mr. Boldwood. What a pleasant surprise. Will you join us? (ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Nice to have you, sir. JACOB: A song, ma'am! I have no voice. (ALL PROTESTING) JACOB: Come on, ma'am, you've got a lovely voice. (ALL CHEERING ENCOURAGINGLY) Come all you fair and tender girls That flourish in your prime Beware, beware Keep your garden fair. Let no man steal your thyme, Let no man steal your thyme. For when your thyme is past and gone He'll care no more for you And every place where your thyme was waste Will all spread o'er with rue, Will all spread o'er with rue. The gardener's son was standing by Three flowers he gave to me The pink, the blue and the violet true And the red, red rosy tree, And the red, red rosy tree. But I refused the red rose bush And gained the willow tree That all the world may plainly see How my love slighted me, How my love slighted me. (ALL APPLAUDING) BOLDWOOD: I thought we were rather good together. So did I. We would make a fine duo. I wanted to thank you for not approaching me on that subject again. Well, it has not been easy. Do you wish me to, er, accompany you back to the house? No, I like to walk around the farm every night to make sure all is safe. Then I... I can walk with you. I've done it many times alone. Good night, Mr. Boldwood. You've been very kind. A pleasure to see you. (GASPS) Who are you? MAN: I'm sorry... I seem to be lost. We're entangled. Are you hurt? No. I'm looking for Weatherbury. I hope I didn't startle you. We've got hitched together somehow. Here, allow me. No. No. Please, let me do it myself. If you lift your foot for a moment... Please don't stare. I don't think I've ever seen a face as beautiful as yours. (FABRIC RIPS) You shouldn't be here. Please let me have the lamp. FARMHAND: A mighty impressive harvest this looks like. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) LIDDY: Miss, look. Who is he, Liddy? Sergeant Francis Troy. Noble blood, full of promise. Very sharp and trim. Well-educated. Good things expected of him. He threw it all in to be a soldier. Well, I won't have it. What are you doing, miss? I'm going to tell him to leave. Sergeant Troy, I must absolutely insist that you leave at this very moment. I can't. Will you follow me, please? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) What angers you, exactly? Please. - What I said Or the way I said it? You must know. There must be some man who tells you that you're beautiful. Oh, not to my face, no... But there is someone who kisses you? I've never been kissed. Why couldn't you have just passed by and said nothing? Do you forgive me? I do not. - Why? Because the things you say... I said that you were beautiful. I wonder if you fight as well as you speak. Better. Meet me. Tomorrow. I can't. You don't want to? Yes, but... Then you must. - I mustn't. (WHISPERS) Nobody would know. Please go now. Tomorrow. Eight o' clock. The hollow in the ferns. (SIGHS) (POCKET WATCH TICKING) Do you trust me? I do. I give you my word as a soldier, I will not harm you. The sword is blunt, but you must not flinch. I'll try not to. You cut my hair. This sword could skin you alive. But you told me I was safe. And you were. Entirely safe. I gave you my word. Now I will take this. Miss Everdene. Perhaps I could walk with you? I'm quite happy to walk by myself. You should have nothing to do with him. He's not good enough for you. He's a perfectly decent man. That's not what I believe. Why? What have you heard? You don't know him at all. It's all rumors. Prejudice simply because he's a soldier. I like soldiers. But not this one. I believe him to have no conscience at all. Stay clear. Don't listen to him. Don't believe him. Get rid of him. And what is it to you? I'm not such a fool as to imagine I might stand a chance now that you are so above me. But don't suppose I'm content to stay a nobody all my life. One day I will leave you. You can be sure of that. But for now, I care for you too much to see you go to ruin because of him. So if you don't mind, I'll... I'll stay by your side. Good evening. "Mr. Boldwoood, "You have been a dear friend to me these past months. "And it is because I value our friendship "so greatly that I am writing. "I am honored by your proposal "and have given it much thought. "But I must tell you that, to my own surprise, "I have undergone what can only be described "as a change of heart. "And I'm afraid I cannot accept your offer." I wasn't sure you'd be here. Where else would I be? You ready? Are you sure? How does this sound? Mrs. Bathsheba Troy. (WHISPERS) All right? Walk on.

So, please-- Charge your glasses and sing out to my most beautiful wife, Mrs. Bathsheba Troy. (ALL CHEERING) Miss Everdene, there's going to be a storm. Oak, you big lump. To me. There's going to be a storm. We need to protect the ricks or we'll lose the harvest. I need five to six men for an hour, no more. Frank, perhaps we ought to... - No. Darling, it's our wedding celebration. It will not rain tonight. My wife forbids it. Now if you'll excuse me. Friends! One more thing.

Come on, hold me! Come here. Come here. (BOTH PANTING) Come here. Come on. (BOTH LAUGHING) Gabriel, I've been a fool. I've always had contempt for silly girls dazzled by flattery in a scarlet uniform.... And now I've done what I swore I would never do. But he told me about another woman, a woman more beautiful that he'd loved before, and I couldn't bear it. So somewhere between jealousy and distraction, I married him. I don't want an opinion on the subject, I just... In fact, I forbid it. Go to bed. I'll finish it on my own. Gabriel... Thank you. GABRIEL: Sir? Mr. Boldwood, sir! I wanted to ensure your mistress' crops were safe. Good work, Gabriel. She's lucky to have you. Wait a moment, sir. You seem unwell, sir. You should go home. Yes. Yes, I...I will. Oak. You know that things have not gone well with me, lately. I was going to get a little settled in life. But, er... it was not to be. I daresay I'm something of a... A joke about the parish. But I do wanna make one thing clear. There was no jilting on her part. We were never engaged. No matter what people say. She promised me nothing. And yet, Gabriel, I feel the most terrible grief. Not a word to her. We understand each other, yes? Yes, sir. (CROWD GROANING) Damn and bother! Sit. Stay. Now, turn around. Can you spare a coin, please? No, no. FRANCIS: Hit him! Come on! WOMAN: Knock him out! MAN: Hit him! (ALL CHEERING) Pay up. Pay up, Mr. Troy. Just take it. FANNY: Sir, excuse me. Could you spare a coin, please? No. Fanny? Hello, Frank. Hello. You're so pale. Oh, Frank. Darling, your hands are shaking. I thought you said All Souls, not All Saints. I went to the wrong church. When I got there, you'd gone. And I don't blame you, but it's been very hard, Frank. I... Not now. My wife mustn't see you. Your wife? (GASPS) Mrs. Troy is very beautiful. No more than you. (FANNY SOBBING) Frank, I must tell you, I'm carrying your child. What? What if I told you that I'd made a terrible mistake, but that I will make amends? I swear on my life I will find a home for you and our baby. You've sworn before, Frank. No, this time... This time... Go to Budmouth. Stay at the Union. The workhouse, Frank? Tonight, just tonight. One night. And then meet me tomorrow at 10:00 on the bridge. I'll bring you all the money I have and I'll find a home for you. You'll be safe, my darling. And I promise you, I promise you I will make amends. Get back in the carriage. Do you know who that woman is? I do. Who is she? She's nothing. Get back in the carriage. Frank... (PANTING) (GROANING) Could you let me have ?20? What for? I need it. If you continue to gamble, we will lose the farm. It's not for gambling. What's it for? Why should it matter what it's for? It's my money. I work for it, don't I? No. You don't. Not proper farm work. Don't do something you'll regret. The money is required for farm expenses. (HORSE APPROACHING) UNDERTAKER: No mistake, Mr. Oak. This was Miss Robbin's last known abode. BATHSHEBA: Fanny was my uncle's servant and we shall treat her with respect. OAK: Perhaps we should take her to the church, just for tonight. No, bring her inside, please. What did she die of, Liddy? I don't know, miss. There were rumors, but... Fanny had a sweetheart, didn't she? Yes, miss. A soldier. LIDDY: Please, come and sit upstairs with me. I seem to cry a great deal these days. I never used to cry at all. Good night, Liddy. 'Night, miss. (DOOR CLOSES) (GASPS) What? Who is it? I can't say... Stay, stay. stay- Don't kiss them, Frank. I'm still your wife. This woman, dead as she is, is more to me than you ever were, or are, or can be. You are nothing to me now. Nothing. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) CONSTABLE: Mrs. Troy? I'm afraid... I'm afraid your husband has drowned. GABRIEL: That's a great responsibility, sir. BOLDWOOD: Nonsense. No reason why a man of your ability shouldn't be able to superintend two farms. And why shouldn't there be stronger links between our establishments? Think of it. Two thousand acres under your sole charge. A share of my profits. Miss Everdene needs me here. And her farm will have priority. I'd still need Miss Everdene's permission. - But, of course! Of course I wouldn't dare do anything without her blessing. And, if it'll help sway your decision, there's an old comrade of yours here. GABRIEL: Georgie! Had to go all the way to Norcombe Hill to find this old fella. - You pleased? Yes, sir, very much. - I'll have your decision soon, yes? You will, sir. Come on. Come on. Come on! Come on! BATHSHEBA: Gabriel, you're getting on in the world. Of course you must accept the offer. GABRIEL: Only with your approval. If I lose the farm, there may be no future for any of us here. You know where my loyalty lies. You're a man of great talent. It's only natural that you should rise. I've no desire to hold you back. Thank you. Come on, Georgie. WILLIAM: Forgive me. I understand there are debts. Your late husband... Perhaps... Perhaps we should change the subject. Perhaps I can help. Mr. Boldwood, that's a very kind offer, but I would never dream of accepting any money. I am a middle-aged man willing to protect you for the rest of your life. You may run your farm, if you wish. Without risk. I'll pay your... departed husband's debts and guarantee its financial stability. It can be your pastime. Of course, we'd ... need to wait, for propriety's sake. But when you're ready, I'm offering you shelter. Comfort. A safe harbor. As my wife. You must at least admire my persistence. (LAUGHS) I do. And like me? Yes. And ... respect me? Yes. Very much. Which is it? Like or respect? It is difficult for a woman to define her feelings in a language chiefly made by men to express theirs. If you worry about a lack of passion on your part, a lack of, er, desire, if you worry about marrying me merely out of guilt, and, ... pity, ...and compromise, well... I don't mind. GABRIEL: When must you give your answer? By Christmas. It's a terrible responsibility. I hold that man's future in my hands. His sanity, too, perhaps. Could you care for him? BATHSHEBA: You may suppose love is wanting. But love's a worn-out, miserable thing for me now. GABRIEL: Why are you asking me? I need someone who's objective. Indifferent. (GABRIEL CHUCKLES) Then I'm afraid you're asking the wrong man. Good evening, Mr. Oak. GABRIEL: Good evening. WORKMAN: That's it...mind! "Rejoice," "Rejoice," "Emmanuel!" "Shall come to thee," "O Israel!" "O come, Thou Rod of Jesse..." WILLIAM: I appreciate you coming along, Oak. Ah! Yes, very good. Well done. Erm... Just more... More things. - Yes, sir! (SIGHS) So ... what do you think? I'm not in the habit of organizing parties. Perhaps we should make it an annual event. Every Christmas Eve. I've invited the whole village. Do you think they'll come? You think Miss Everdene will come? OAK: I'm sure she will. Yes! And you'll come too l hope. I know Miss Everdene would like you to be here. Perhaps, for an hour or so. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Look, I'm shaking. I'm so nervous. Gabriel, will you...? As well as you can, please. I'll try. Is there a knot that's particularly fashionable? (GABRIEL LAUGHING) You're asking the wrong man. What about women? Does a woman keep her promise? She has promised? An implied promise. Once again, I'm... Will she do what's right? If it's not inconvenient to her. Oak, you've become quite cynical lately. She never promised that first time. Therefore, she has never broken her promise. She hasn't promised this time, either. But she will. Tonight. I know she will. And when she does... I wanted to tell you in advance, Gabriel, because...I believe I know your secret. I've seen you together. The way you speak to her. And watch her. And look after her. And I know her, er, profound affection for you. You've behaved like a man, and as the successful rival, successful through your kindness, I wish to tell you-- l am profoundly grateful. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (BUTLER CLEARS THROAT) The cook would like a word, sir. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (LIVELY CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING) LIDDY: Kiss me. Joseph. JOSEPH: No, please don't. Liddy, don't. GABRIEL: Would you excuse me, please? I've come to say good night. Go back and talk to the poor things. You've broken their hearts. I don't suit this kind of affair. No. Nor do I. I wish I could go, too. (SONG ENDS) (GUESTS APPLAUDING) I must go. Not before you've danced. Both of you. I insist. Mr. Oak? Thank you. (SONG BEGINS) Tell me what to do. Gabriel? Do what is right. Sorry, excuse me. (SOFTLY) Frank. Black suits you. Although a little premature. You're alive. And here I am. Pulled from the sea. Some fishermen found me and brought me to shore. Then I discovered I was dead and found I preferred it. For a while, anyway. Why have you come back? The strangest thing. I missed you. You don't seem very happy to see me. You said I was nothing to you. (CHUCKLES) Did I? Well, then. Honesty at all times. I find myself in need of money. I gave up my profession for you; it seems a little harsh that you have a farm and a house while I'm living off nothing. There is no money. Then sell the farm. Come home. No. I said, come home. I'm your husband! And you'll obey me! (GUNSHOT) (GASPS) (SOFTLY) Oh, my God. BATHSHEBA: Let me see. GABRIEL: If it's any consolation, his life will be spared. Crime of passion. Morning, Liddy. COGGAN: It's a fine harvest, ma'am. Best we've had in years. Will we have it all over before the dew? COGGAN: We will indeed, ma'am. Luck's been on our side. Come, Liddy, give me a hand. (CLEARS THROAT) I'm sorry I startled you. I wanted to tidy up for them. I haven't been here for so long. Are you going in? Rehearsals. I sing bass in the choir. Yes, I've heard you. (CHUCKLING) Then I apologize. I've been hoping to get a chance to talk to you. We've... We've not spoken as much as I'd have liked. No. I'm leaving England. Leaving? Going to America. There's a boat leaving Bristol in four days' time. I'll be on it. Now that the farm is secure. I understand I should give you notice. No. You must go when you want. I'll leave first thing tomorrow. No fuss. I think that's best. (OLD GEORGE WHIMPERING) (SIGHING) (OLD GEORGE YIPS) Gabriel! Gabriel. Wait. You'll think I'm strange, but... I've been worried. Have I offended you somehow? No, not at all. Is it money? I'll pay you whatever you want. I don't need money now. A formal partnership, then? Nor a partnership. The farm belongs to you alone. It's the finest farm for miles around. Then why else are you leaving? I said I'd leave you one day. Well, you must not go. You forbid me? Yes, if you like. (CHUCKLES) I forbid you. It's time for you to fight your own battles. And win them, too. So we should say good-bye, then? I suppose so. Gabriel, wait. Thank you, Gabriel. You've believed in me and fought for me and stood by my side when all the rest of the world was against me. And we've been through so much together. Wasn't I your first sweetheart? Weren't you mine? (SIGHING) And now I'd have to go on without you. If I knew... If I knew that you would let me love you and marry you... But you will never know. Why not? Because ... you never ask! Would you say no again? I don't know. Probably. (BOTH LAUGHING) So why don't you? Ask me? Ask me. Ask me, Gabriel. Come all you fair and tender girls That flourish in your prime Beware, beware Keep your garden fair Let no man steal your thyme Let no man steal your thyme For when your thyme it is past and gone He'll care no more for you And every place Where your thyme was waste Will all spread o'er with rue Will all spread o'er with rue. The gardener's son was standing by Three flowers he gave to me The pink, the blue and the violet true And the red, red rosy tree And the red, red rosy tree. But I refused the red rose bush And gained the willow tree That all the world may plainly see How my love slighted me How my love slighted me.
