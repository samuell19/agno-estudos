Dora ! Dora ! Dora! Dora, shut that dog up! If you don't, I will throw him back to the slums where it belongs! What can I do? Mikky won't come near me. Do something, or else your non-pedigree dog will be eaten. Mikky! Mikky, come here! Mikky... Mikky... Come here, Mikky! Be quiet, my sister is angry! What is it, Mikky? Nooo, that sound! That sound again! Mikky, where are you going? Mikky? You'll wake Father! Mikky... Ahhhh! Dad! Gertrude. Yes, ma'am. Go. Last year more than 17.9 million air travellers... from over 100 different nationalities took part in the only truly global... - independent passenger survey... - independent passenger survey... of airline standards. I am proud to tell you that the surveys did not lie... when Go Dong Hae Airlines won... the prestigious Airline of the Year Award for 20 1 1. llPrestigious"-- I hate that word. lllllustrious"-- that sounds better, don't you think? Yes, Miss Kimmy. I think so too, Miss Kimmy. Are the figures correct? 17.9 million respondents? Actually it's 17.896 to be precise... So why didn't you say 18 million instead of 17.9 ? Where are your brains, Gertrude? I'm sorry Miss Kimmy, I'll have it corrected. This year we are unveiling a new destination that is truly dear... to the heart of the Go Dong Hae Group of Companies. With great pride I announce that Go Dong Hae Airlines... now flies daily and direct to the land of morning calm- Korea! Paul, come here. Yes, Miss Kimmy. Your creations. I'm so surprised. So disappointing. What happened to you? You can keep your gown. Ma'am Kimmy, which Jaguar are you using? The pearl gray or Stratos gray? Neither. Tell the driver to take out the lunar gray Jaguar. Right away. This evening is for you, this evening is for us. Thank you for making Go Dong Hae Airlines... the world's number one passengers' choice. Let's all raise our glasses as we usher in... a new era for Go Dong Hae Airlines. Kampai! " Kampai" ? Gertrude, you don't say "Kampai"! That's Japanese! You say "Gonbei"! That's "Cheers" in Korean. That's a fatal mistake! I told you to proofread this and I end up doing it myself! What's wrong with you? We're all here at the gala launch of Go Dong Hae Airlines'... launching of its new daily flights to Korea. As you can see, Manila's high society is all here... This way, Miss Aquino. - Good evening. - Mr. Senator. - Good evening, Mr. Senator. - Good evening. - Mr. Senator. - Hi. - Hello. Hi, good evening. - Hi Kris, you look beautiful! Miss Kimmy, one shot please! - Miss Kimmy! - Hi, Miss Kimmy. Miss Kimmy, over here. Miss Kimmy, could we do a short interview? Just a short one, Miss Kimmy... Good evening, Dad! Nice suit! - Hi. - Oh, the Gentleman from San Juan! Congratulations! - Thank you! - Why haven't you answered my calls? I just want to set a meeting. Sure! - When? Next week? - Next year! Miss Kimmy, wait. No! No! No! Get out of my way. - Miss Kimmy, I don't think you should... - No. Let's get this thing over with. - Miss Kimmy I think you should wait for... - Get out of my way! Miss Kimmy, please... Oh my God. Her outfit matches the venue. You are all fired!!! Miss Kimmy, I'm sorry. I'm really so sorry. Miss Kimmy, I'm sorry. I'm really so sorry. After all the preparation and the rehearsing, for what? Heads will roll, Gertrude. I'm telling you. Heads will roll! Who is in charge of the decorations committee? Tell me! It's... Miss Dora. But it's my fault for not checking the design. Get out! - Hi, big sister! - Doraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! What possessed you to humiliate me like this! You must be very happy. You're hyperventilating with excitement. Did you like the d√©cor Mikky and I did? I chose your favorite color and fabric, and Mikky chose your favorite flower. Didn't we do great? But we're also very tired so we're getting massages. So tired! Here's your oatmeal, Dad. - Thank you, dear. - You're welcome, Dad. Eat up! Look Dad, it's me, Dora! The happiest girl in the world! I chose my sister's favorite color. - Did I do well, Dad? - Yes, dear. Good morning, big sister! Breakfast time! Do you think I'd have an appetite after you sabotaged my moment last night? Yes, why not. Kimmy, it's so early, can't we just forget it? I have to rush to the boxing gym. I can't rest until I hit something. Or someone. Dora, what are you eating? Pancakes, waffles, bread, rice, ricecakes? That's carbs on carbs on carbs. Please, don't ruin my buzz. Have you both packed? We're going to Korea. All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go. Dad, could I skip this trip? I'd prefer to go to Barry's farm and hide my shame. Daughter, they're expecting us. The press releases are out already. You, Dora and I have to fly to Korea. I think it's a great promotional move. And we haven't traveled together in ages. I'm e s o e x c it d I _I .! Whatever, Dad. I have to go. I'll see you at the office. - Bye big sister, catch you later!! - Pest! (Burps) Sorry Dad, my bad! Sir Luisito, special delivery for you. Dad, what's that? Nothing, child. Enjoy your waffles. While I'm in Korea, arrange series of meetings with potential investors. Make that happen. I don't want to waste any time. Ma'am, that will be your appointment on Day 3. Day 3! Why not Day 1? Because you're fully booked on the first two days. Doing what? Mr. Luisito asked that we block them off for photo ops with him and Miss Dora... for press release. To boost Philippine tourism in the area. Good morning, Miss Kimmy, your 10:30 is here. Send him in. You may go now. Go! Go! Go! We'll have this out later. Hi Mr. Barry, go right in. Kimmy. Oh Barry! Barry! What a breath of fresh mountain air! I brought you some presents. Wow! - They're all freshly-picked. - For my vegetable stew! - Where's Dora? - At the pool, Sir. Dora! Dora? Dora! Dora! What happened to you? - Hi Johnson! - Hi. Surprise! What did happen to you? I thought- Johnson, is that how you go swimming? In casual attire? No, I thought you had drowned. It's called floating. Are these your free-range quails and chickens? They're so cute to eat! You shouldn't have, but thanks! Since you couldn't come to the farm, I brought the farm to you. Oh Barry, you don't know how happy you've made me by coming here. All this work. Problems. Choices. Dilemmas. Decisions and whatnot. It's all making me lose my mind all over again. Without you I would've given in. Given up! Surrendered! Dora. Do you love me? - Of course I love you. - Really? Of course. Which leads me to my next question. Are you willing to take this to the next level? The next level of what? The next level of the relationship. What relationship? Ours! The next level is like, building a home... living together, having babies... Babies? Like Mikky? Yes, but not little puppies. Little Doras and Johnsons. You are the only source of my happiness. The fountain of my peace and calm. You are the hot wind beneath my gilded wings! What are you talking about? What I'm trying to say is, I miss you and I love you. Son of a gun! I love you too, Kimmy. I know. Oh my God. We have to get a ring. Okay, a ring. When you come back you'll have a ring. There you go. Thank you. Will that be all? Will you be needing anything else, Miss Dora? Do you have bread? Yes, we have bread. We have croissants, focaccia, multi-grain, French bread... - Do you have putok? - Yes, Miss Dora we have putok. - Pan de regla? - And we have pan de regla. Yay! Do you have sundot kulangot? Yes Miss Dora, we have kulangot. Here you go, Miss Dora. Putok, pan de regla, pan de coco, kulangot and some cheeses. Thank you very much! You're welcome. Excuse me. Yes, Miss Kimmy? Is this toilet secure? Is it airtight? Yes of course, Ma'am, this is a brand-new plane. I know it's brand-new, I bought it, remember? You should have it checked. I hear strange noises in it. Would you like to use the one in economy instead? Yuck! All right, escort me. This way, Ma'am. Wow, Little Dipper. Big Dipper. Dora, what the hell! You're disturbing everyone. - Kimmy I saw the scariest thing! - What is it this time, Dora? - I had a bad dream! - Of course you'll have nightmares... you've been loading up on carbs all day. You're such an eating machine. - Please, can I sleep next to you? - No! - No! - Please! Go back to your seat and let me catch some Zzzs. If you can't sleep, let others sleep. Okay girls, now that we're in Korea, what do you want to do? Honestly, Dad, I'd rather sleep all day. Dora? Me, Dad? Let me check. Things to do, things to see, things to eat. Ooh, shopping! Yangdong! Yangdong! Yangdong! - Miss Kimmy. - Hi! Hi! How nice! Wow! Can I go swimming in it? Big sister, what about a smile? Roar! Now a wacky pose! Picture-taking! Ready? Hello, Korean! Wow! Tomorrow we have to wake up early. We're going somewhere. Where to this time? We've been all over the place. We have to pay our respects to our ancestors. We're going to a temple. But I thought this is going to be a vacation. - Temple! Temple! Temple! - Ssssh! Temple! Temple! Temple! Wow! The temple is very big. And the snow is very white. Do they have a souvenir shop? I have to buy presents for Mikky. Ssssh, Dora! Be quiet, this is a temple. Dora! That's a snowman! Sssssh, please be quiet, this is a temple. Dad, are you done? I'm done. Let's go back to the mall. Wait, I have to talk to you. Right now. What about? Can't it wait till we get to the Philippines? Now, this is important. At my age, there's nothing else I could want. I have almost everything. Almost. I just have three wishes. First, you must come to this temple each year... to pay your respects to our ancestors in this temple. This temple has witnessed all the joys and tragedies of our clan. When I am dead, I want you to scatter my ashes in this place. God, Dad, you're so morbid. You have to keep your word. Every year, remember. Sure Dad, I promise. Twice a year, even. Okay, can we go back to the mall? Second, I have a story to tell you. I should've told you long ago. A story? Story time! This is not a fairy tale or Mother Goose. This is about our clan. Okay Dad, I'm listening. Go! Go! Go! Go! I've told you that our families have not always been rich. In fact the Gas used to be poor. My parents sold kimchi in the market. They had the most popular kimchi stall. When I was a child they taught me to work hard and be patient. One family was instrumental in the rise of the Go clan. The Sang family. They gave us their trust and confidence. Because of their investment, we prospered. The Gas and Sangs, two families joined... by success, failure, happiness, sadness. To this day- you know this, Kimmy- the Sangs hold substantial shares in our empire. No wonder. I've told you many times to buy them out, but you won't do it. That's not going to happen. We Gos honor our promises. We keep our debts of honor. What a lovely story. I can convince you next time to buy the Sangs' shares. Now can we go? Cute story, Dad. Can we go? Three wishes, children. My third wish is for one of you will have to marry a Sang. What? What, Dad? Should I say it in Tagalog? One of you must marry a Sang. That's preposterous, Dad. It has been arranged, Kimmy. And that's my last and final wish. That's insane, Daddy. There is no more arranged marriage in this day and age. It's non-negotiable, Kimmy. We're meeting the Sang family tomorrow for brunch. No! A vow is a vow. It's time to honor tradition and follow our ancestors' wishes. Then let Dora marry into the Sangs. Daddy! (unintelligible) Kimmy, I'm counting on you. This is what it's all about? It all comes down to this. You're so predictable. I'm not surprised. Of course you won't let your dear Dora marry a stranger. It has to be me. Always me. And I have no say in it, you've already made your decision. Kimmy, calm down. No! Not this time. I'm tired of you, of Dora and to anybody, and this time I'm saying no. No, Daddy, No! Kimmy! - Dad! - Come back here. Dad, I can't move my face. It's that freaking sound again! Make it stop! Miss? Are you okay? Leave me alone! Don't touch me! Go away! Sorry, Miss. Hello. - It's been a long time. - You haven't changed. These are my daughters. Kimmy... How do you do, Miss Kimmy. Hello. And this is Dora. How do you do, Miss Dora. Thank you! I'm so excited and I can't hide it. I'm glad to meet the ladies who will be the bride. The successor of the Sang Empire. The richest man in Korea. That's my handsome great grandchild. Great! When will my girls meet Daniel Sang? He's already in there. Okay. I' m ready. Let's get this nonsense over with. Please sit down. Please. Hello. Hello your own face. Don't come near me or else my dress will eat you. It's alive! If you touch me I will kill you. Understand? Yes. The nerve! Dora! It's your turn. No, Daddy, I don't like. Your turn, Dora. Hello. My name is Dora, D-O-R-A. Wow, Dora. I beg your pardon. English only, please. No! No! No! No! I don't like. I guess Daniel likes Dora a lot. The sooner we set the wedding date, the better. This is a blessed day for the Sangs. I think it's settled, Daddy. I have to go. There's no more time! I see no reason why we should rush this wedding. If ever there's going to be one. The marriage has to push through. Our family has suffered long enough. It's time for you to keep the promise. We have to make peace. What do you mean? I know you still remember it. You remember what has happened, Luisito! Elena! Yes? Please get me some packing tape. Yes, please wait while I find some. Thank you, I love you. Mwah, mwah. Mwah, mwah. Sister, I get what Dad means. Congratulations. After 8 hours you've absorbed it. What an improvement. And no, I'm not marrying someone I don't love. I won't. Dora, for once do something worthwhile for this family. This is your chance. But what about Johnson? What about that twerp? Is that dummy more important than Dad? Than the business? Than our family? But I love Johnson. And Johnson loves Mikky. And Mikky loves Johnson. And Johnson loves me. - And Dora loves Johnson. - Forget about Johnson. You are going to be Mrs. Daniel Sang very very soon. Because Daniel Sang loves Dora! If you're going to be a jerk, could you please get lost? For the last time: I'm not getting married to that icky person. Nooo. If you can defy Dad, by all means. Do whatever you want, Dora. Let's see who can hold out. May the stronger one win. One thing's for sure: you will fail. You'll fail, too. Epic fail! Good night! Good night, my packing sister. Packing tape please, Elena. Do you have any packing tape? What did you say? Pack-ing-tape. Elena, what's taking you so long? Where are you? Elena, packing tape, please! Elena, I need the packing tape now! Elena? Elena, have you found any packing tape? Who are you? Elena, make sure none of my things have been left behind. Yes, Ma'am Kimmy. Kimmy, where's your sister? I don't know and I don't care. I don't want to miss our flight. Elena, find Dora. We're leaving. - Dora! - What are you doing there? Come on, I've been ready since yesterday. Dora, you stink. Didn't you shower? I'm not sitting beside you. Sit beside the driver. Kimmy. Daddy, come on. Ma'am Dora, here's your packing tape. Thank you Elena, let's go! Come on, let's go! Kimmy, we need to talk. No, Dad, there's nothing left to talk about. The future groom has made his choice and that's that. Kimmy! Mikky! I miss you, Mikky! Come here! Mikky? Mikky, it's me, Dora. Your friend. Don't you remember me? What's wrong with me? Do I smell bad? I'll take a shower, I promise. I know what you want. Look, it's your favorite. Come on, come on! Mikky, what's wrong? Overall I'd say we're in great shape. Miss Kimmy? You just got home and you're back at work? Rest a bit. Come and see me. Miss Kimmy? Miss Kimmy? Miss Kimmy? Yes, go on, I'm listening. Our latest venture, Go Dong Hae Oil... drilled 45 new wells last year in Qatar... the Black Sea and Kazakhstan... including the giant Kazhakan field located offshore... - in the Caspian Sea. - I miss you... That's remarkable, don't you agree, Miss Kimmy? Miss Kimmy? Miss Kimmy? Carry on. In so far as the performance of our Go Dong Hae Supermalls are concerned... we have even managed to increase revenue... l...love...you...more! GDH Telecom stock was up by 400 percent... the best performance in the last five years... What! Miss Kimmy? Oh my God... - It's that sound. - What's that sound? Don't you hear it? Make it stop! Get her some water! Careful. Doc, you know Kimmy's medical history. I am fully aware, Sir Luisito. They could be delayed symptoms manifesting now. You know she had typhoid fever as a child. Excuse me. Nothing significant to report. Sir, you have nothing to worry about. All test results say she is normal. You know how your daughter is... could be over-fatigue and too much stress. Kimmy does overdo things. At work. Dora. Barry! What happened to your sister? She's fine. The doctor said she's just super-stressed from work. As usual. You know how she overdoes things. At work. Good thing you got here. When I got your text I hurried over. Poor girl. She'll be all right, don't you worry. Miss Dora, you need to sign for something at the lab. Me? The lab? What's that? Lab results. Lab results? Go on. I'll look after your sister. Okay, thank you. Just a minute. - Oh my God, my eye! What the hell! - Kimmy? Barry. Don't get up. How did you know I'm here? Dora texted me. You shouldn't have bothered. How are you feeling? I feel fine. I feel great. I feel perfect. Especially now that you're here. I'll watch over you until you're discharged. I'll be right here, Kimmy. Thank you for your concern. I appreciate it. So much. It's nothing. I do have a request. But you have to say yes first. What? Say yes first. But I don't feel like loosing bowel. Say yes. Yes. Oh! You mean... oh my God. You mean yes. All right. Yes, Barry. When you get out of here, you'll go on vacation. No cellphone, no Internet, no work. - Just the two of us. - But... No buts. Didn't you say yes? It's so unfair. I brought you something. I'm sure you'll like it. Is it organic? Yes. Is it juicy? Yes. Is it... big? Big enough. Then give it to me! Kimmy? Kimmy? I thought you were going to bite it, I didn't think you'd swallow. What is that? A ring. A ring? Inside the orange? What kind of fiber do you grow? Kimmy, I know I'm a lowly farmer. I have nothing to offer you but the fruit of my labor. But I swear that together we will have happiness and abundance. So Kimmy, will you marry me? Yes, Barry! Yes! A thousand times yes! I love you, Kimmy. I love you too, Barry. Kimmy? I think I slightly lacerated my throat. I need water. I'll get you water. There's no water here, I'll get some outside. Okay. Thank you. I love you. Okay, I love you too! - What does this mean? - It's negative. Oh my God! Negative. It means there's nothing wrong with her. - Are you sure? - Yes, Ma'am. Sign here please. Nurse! Nurse, help me! Miss Kimmy, what's wrong? It's that sound! What sound was that, Miss Kimmy? That horrid sound! What kind of horrid sound was that, Miss Kimmy? Make it stop! Dora, I'm just going out to buy... - What will I stop, Miss Kimmy? - What happened? Call the doctor, quickly! Yes, right away. Barry... It stopped. What stopped, Miss Kimmy? That sound. What sound was that, Miss Kimmy? That horrid sound. - Kimmy, Kimmy, Barry's in Emergency. - What? - Kimmy, Kimmy, Barry's in Emergency. - What? - Kimmy, Kimmy, Barry's in Emergency. - Barry! What's the diagnosis, Doctor? What's wrong with him? Is he going to be okay? Please tell me he will be okay. To be honest with you, we've never encountered a case like this before. Think about your answer carefully, Doctor. Let me remind you that I own this hospital... and I can fire you right here, right now. Yeah, yeah! Calm down, Miss Kimmy. The good news is that... all the Vital organs are functioning normally. Only his brain is not. Can you please elaborate? It's like a prolonged state of shock. Like in a coma, but he's awake. - Sister, I saw a ghost. - You'd better do your job well, and fast! - Give us more time, Miss Kimmy. - Do it now! We'll update you every step of the way. Calm down, child. The doctors are doing what they can. He proposed to me, Dad. Just minutes ago. You must be very happy. Now all your plans can push through. That's so unfair, Kimmy. Miss Kimmy. Manny. What happened to Barry? We still don't know. Don't worry, everything will be fine. Dad, Doc, I saw a ghost. Sister... Please leave me alone, Dora. I'm serious. Sister, I have to tell you. In the elevator I saw a ghost. I don't have time for this nonsense, Dora. - I don't need this right now. - Listen to me. The ghost I saw in the elevator was the same ghost I saw in Korea... and the same ghost who attacked Barry. I have no time for this, Dora. Why don't you talk to Mikky, you're on the same wavelength. Why don't you believe me? Will you listen to yourself? Go home with Dad. Leave me here. I don't need you. Go. I'm scared. Go home now! Dad, there was a ghost at the hospital! Can I sleep in your room, please? I promise to be quiet. Good night, Dora. Ma'am Dora. Ma'am Dora? It's all right. Dora? Who's there? Johnson? Dora. Johnson! Get up. Everything will be all right. Maybe when we Visit Barry he'll be up and about. I don't want to because there's a ghost outside. Goat? There's no goat here. I didn't see any goats. Ghost! Ghost! How slow you are. Ghost? Ghost. So what? Are you going to hide in here forever? Come on, get up. Johnson, you believe me? Yes I do. I always believe in you. Really? Really. - There's a ghost outside. - Stand up. Come on. - Dora ? - Johnson ? Do you remember what you told me last week? Should we get a ring? Ring! Ring! Hello? I'm giving you the ring. Oh, ring. Dora, babe, I'm asking you. Asking me what? That. - Johnson, look! It's my name! - I know. Do-ra will you...marry...me. Yup. Dora, will you marry me? Dora, will you marry me? Well, answer. I love you, Johnson, I always have and I always will. Yes, I will marry you. - Really? - Yes. - Really? - Really. Wow. See, it fits you so well. Bye, Johnson. See you! Johnson, wait! Stop the car! Driver Maning, where are you? - What are you saying, Elena? - Driver Maning! Where is he? I need a driver, quick! He's on vacation, Ma'am. He's having an executive check-up. And the other drivers are with Ma'am Kimmy and Sir Luisito. What's going on? Do you know how to drive? Only a little. Elena, could we go faster? Is your seatbelt on? Seatbelt? You're slower than a tortoise. What kind of seatbelt is this? Hello? What? Hello? Please drive faster, it's a matter of life and death. I'm doing my best, Ma'am Dora. Hello? Hello? Hello? Johnson? Doc, what's your diagnosis? To be honest with you, Miss Dora... his Vital signs are okay but he's in a prolonged state of shock. But he's awake. Doc, could you speak properly? Let me remind you that my sister owns this hospital... and she can fire you right here, right now. He may have had a stroke when the accident happened. No! He didn't have a stroke! I saw a ghost in his car as he left. Dad, it's Johnson! Where's Kimmy? I don't care, Gertrude. Don't go home until you've finished it. I have a confession to make. Again? Another story? Dad, this is no time for storytelling. You have to hear me out. Give me a chance. There's all sorts of craziness going on... and you have time for another stupid story? Dad, I'm listening. There's a story I should've told you long ago. It's about a woman I met when I was young. Her name was Kang. Sang Kang Kang. She was a pretty, modest, and gracious young lady. We were kids when our parents agreed that we should marry. The marriage was part of the contract for their investment in our company. Sang Kang Kang was sweet. Too sweet. Wherever! went, there she was... bringing food, flowers and love letters. My parents sent me to a university in the Philippines... so I could learn English. That was the last time I saw Sang Kang Kang. At the university I met your mother, Charito. The moment I saw her I was ensnared by her beauty. She was very kind, humane, an animal rights activist. She became my private tutor in English and Tagalog... so I learned quickly. No man could resist falling for her. Repeat after me. Cute. Surprise! We are gathered together... Me? I cannot marry. Proceed. I give you this ring. - I give you this ring. - As a sign of my love. Before long, your mother and I were married. One day I received news from home. Sang Kang Kang had died. My parents called me back to Korea, where I learned that she died of loneliness. The Sangs were furious at me. My family was furious at me. To make peace, we agreed that one of my children... would marry one of their children. That's you, Kimmy, Dora. Dad, no one dies of loneliness. Yes, but lonely people kill themselves. During our trip to Korea they told me what really happened to Sang Kang Kang. When she heard that I'd married Charito... she locked herself up in her room for a long, long time. She spoke to no one. She didn't see the sun. One day a foul stench filled the house... and they found that Sang Kang Kang had killed herself. Dad, have you stooped to this? This is emotional blackmail of the highest order. What do we have to do with this lovesick Korean woman... who's been dead for decades? You don't understand. We broke the vow to our elders. That's why this craziness is happening. So what? You think this is a curse? Of all people, you believe in curses? I'm not sure I believe in curses but I believe in karma. And I'm supposed to neutralize this bad karma? I said it once and I'll say it again. I'm not going to do it. If Mom were alive, you think she'd agree to this? Kimmy, you're walking out again! It is out of the question. You have disgraced us once, and now you're doing it again. Dora! Dora! Make that dog shut up... or I'll throw it back into the slums where it belongs. What can I do, Mikky won't come near me. Mikky! Where are you? Do you understand how much mental suffering this family went through when Sang Kang Kang killed herself? It's that sound again! Mikky, what are you doing there? - Make him stop! - Come here, come here. Mikky, come here. - Dora, shut that dog up! - Mikky, please be quiet. Kimmy's really angry. Stop it! What can I do? I love my daughters too much. I don't understand you. Where are you going? Mikky! Their happiness is all I want in this world. I'm sorry. I will pull out all our investments in your companies. L uisito. Dora, make it stop! Dad! - Dad! - Dad! - Elena, the key to Dad's room! - Dad! Elena, quickly! - Elena, the key to Dad's room! - Dad! Dad! Here it is. Dad! Do you see what I see? He's mine! They're all mine! Can you hear what I hear, Dora? Let go of my Dad! Doc, what's the diagnosis? I don't know what's wrong with your loved ones, but of the three your father has a weak heart. Yes, I know we have been fired. Manny. Daddy... Daddy... Daddy... Mikky, what's that? Mikky... Kimmy.. What's that, Dora? - Kimmy... - Dora! What's this? What? Kimmy, that's the ghost I saw in Korea, in the elevator, in Johnson's car, and there on the bed. Dora, that drum. That sound. It's her. Could she be Sang Kang Kang? No! It's Barry! Barry! Johnson. Johnson. Johnson. Dad. They're all mine. Mine! Mine! What? - She said, "They' re all mine. Mine!" - She said that!? Ma'am Kimmy. You have a Visitor. In the patio. She stayed her for some time. But I sense only traces. I brought him here. He might be able to help. I told him the stories Dora told me. She shows herself to me in this house. Shall we look for her? We can try to set a trap. I can hear her. A powerful spirit has captured the souls of your loved ones. I would not be surprised if in life she dealt with the forces of darkness. Sang Kang Kang, pawn of darkness! Show yourself! Show yourself! Sang Kang Kang, pawn of darkness! Show yourself! Show yourself! Sang Kang Kang, pawn of darkness! Show yourself! Show yourself! Show yourself!... Show yourself! We've been here all night. Well, the spirit came from Korea so she could be at the airport. Oh good, she's here at last. Get ready! We face Sang Kang Kang. She's here. I can see her! Where is she, Dora? Behind Gertrude! Shut up Gertrude! Leave us alone! Give us back our men! Go back to hell! What did she say? The witch said, "You had your chance and you blew it." You're a creep, Sang Kang Kang! You should hide! What did she say? She said everytime we refuse to marry a Sang, she gets a groom for herself. Imagine! The nerve of this woman. You witch!
