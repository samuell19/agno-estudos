He's been labeled as a genius, a prodigy, a mastermind. - Only one took home the coveted first prize award at this year's sci-tech Computer-Con, and that lucky person was teenage phenom, Atticus Virtue, for creating his very own robot. - Atticus Virtue has already committed to MIT with a full-ride scholarship. - Become the youngest recruit in the school storied history. - Virtue Inc. went public today with stocks trading for the first time. Valuations are soaring into space, like one of its rocket ships. - [Man] Atticus Virtue connect billionaire to his resume. - [Man] But he's also connecting the country with his high-speed bullet train. - [Woman] His outstanding achievements in the computer sciences have become front and center-- - Later today, he will oversee the launch of his manned spaceflight to Mars. - [Man] The guy is living the ultimate life. He's rich, he's famous-- - But you know what they say about him, right? Guys wanna be Atticus Virtue and girls wanna be Atticus Virtue. - [Woman] Check this out, Northwest Arkansas, Bentonville High's brand new athletic facility opens today. - [Man] That's right, wow, all courtesy of hometown hero, Atticus Virtue. Look at that. - So cool. - And there's some shakeups within the company over the last five years. Things have been fairly quiet for Atticus Virtue and his tech company. Some saying he's ready to retire. Other insiders speculating that he is working on something so top secret, so groundbreaking that it's going to change reality as we know it. - Haven. (intense music) (dog barking) (tense music) (keyboard tapping) (computer beeps) (bag zips) - [Cathy] I should hopefully see you guys after school, as long as they don't make me work a double again. - So we just gave up on the idea of dad sending money ever again? - We don't need money from your father. - You know there's this thing called karma, and one day it's gonna catch up to him. I'm just gonna laugh in his face. Seriously, mom, just give me 10 minutes, and I can hack into this credit card's website, and make the late fee disappear. - I know you can. But, sweetie, that's called stealing. - Yeah, they're stealing from us. - Your brother's gonna freeze to death outside. Now go! - Okay. (tense music) (door opens and creaks) Get up, Sparky. - What took you so long? - Oh nothing, I was just hacking into all the Smart Doorbell systems in the neighborhood. - I have so many questions, but mainly just why? - Okay, check it out. (keypad typing) (phone beeping) Okay. (doorbell rings) (door opens) (door closes) - [Ethan] Wow. - Mm-hmm. - And you wonder why you have no friends, no job, no life, no boyfriend-- - And no cares in the world, Ethan. (upbeat lively music) - All right, I'll be right here to pick you up, sweetie. - Thanks, dad, love you. - I love you, too. ♪ Could somebody wake me up ♪ ♪ You seem like a dream ♪ ♪ I'm holding my breath because ♪ - Move your hand. No, the other hand. - Oh, like this? - No, mom, I'm trying to see the fancy dashboard. - Oh, sorry, I thought you wanted me in it. - Very funny, mom. (camera snaps) Mm, perfect. This should get like 20,000 likes before lunch. - I am so proud of you, honey. Potatoes. - [Both] French fries. - Bye mom. Hey, watch it, freak. - Oh, look I'm Internet famous. Move! - Hey! - What? - Don't. - Back up. - Do you think we're doomed as a species? - What, I'm sorry, what were you talking about? - I said don't you think Connor Lawson's a little out of your league? - What? What do you, just, ah, you're so annoying. (whistle blows) - I know it must feel very weird for you to be moving your legs around so much. But that's called jogging. And that weird shiny stuff is called sweat. (whistle blows) Stretch it out. What are you doing on the bench? - What are you talking about, playa? - Benny, we talked about this. You can't call me playa anymore. And what's wrong with you this week? - Tendinitis. I got a note from my mom. - How many hours of Fortify do you play every day? - Enough to be the best. - Enough to give you tendinitis? - Let's just say, enough to get a note from my mom so I don't have to jog and sweat around the gym, playa. (Benny scoffs) (whistle blows) Playa, playa. - And I have found to no surprise that the future of me is in my posts, my thoughts, and in my eyes. Thank you. - Well, now that was an interesting choice for a poem, Sophia. - It was called Sophia. - And it was very clear. Thank you, Sophia. Max Winslow, you're up. - So anyway here's my poem. - Well, Max, that's not poem. It's, that's just gibberish. - It's a firewall code. - [Mr. Harris] A what code? - A firewall code. And in my opinion it's better than a poem, 'cause it serves an actual purpose. This one keeps bad things out, so if you delete any of the letters or numbers in the code then the whole thing falls apart. It doesn't work unless everything works together. So, yeah, and that's pretty poetic. (door shuts) (tense music) - Hello, students of Bentonville High School. I'm Atticus Virtue. But I'm guessing you already know that. As many of you know, I constructed The Virtue Manor in 2009 in order to conduct some very cutting edge experiments. My goal has always been to build a better tomorrow, to bring the future into the present. Well, I am pleased to announce that my experiments have been a success. That's right. Long before my little startup turned into the billion dollar tech company it is today, I grew up in Northwest Arkansas. I'm proud of my humble roots. I'm proud to have attended the same high school that you are all sitting at today. And that is why I wanna give back to my community. So I am conducting one final experimental competition. Exactly five students will be chosen, be invited to my home here. Those five students will compete in a game. The winner of that game will get the key to my manor. It is really that simple. So the school bell will ring at 3 p.m., at 3:16 on the dot and you all will receive a text. Five of you will be chosen, got it? Benediximus. That's Latin. Good luck. (bell rings) (enlightening music) - [Man] Yeah, that dude's like a total hermit now. - [Woman] Yeah, but he's worth 32 billion. - [Woman] I would die if I got to go to that thing tonight. (enlightening music) (phones beeping) (sighs) (phones beeping) - No way, I got invited. - No, you didn't. - No, you didn't. - Bro, no way (chuckles). (phone dings) (screams) - Oh my gosh, my Instagram followers are gonna love this. I should, I could do a live stream. I have to tell my mom. (phone beeps) - Yes. No, what is this? - Mom, you are not gonna believe what just happened to me. - [Ethan] Wait, Maxine! Sorry, I mean Max. Did you see this thing? - [Max] Yeah, I did, obviously. - [Ethan] So I guess you got a note then, too? - [Max] I didn't even look at it. - You, you didn't even check your phone? - There are 3,000 kids in that high school, only five are getting chosen, do you even know what those odds are? - No, stop trying to do the math in your head. It's a 0.167% chance. - Did you really just do that math in your head? Is that common core? - Listen, Ethan. Do I wanna go to Atticus Virtue's mansion? Of course I do. - Here, just let me look for you. - Okay, if it'll make you stop. - No. - See? - Way. - What? - No way. You got invited to Atticus Virtue's weird mansion party thing. - No way. Dude, yes! Come on! - He's launched rockets into space, redefined artificial intelligence, and now eccentric billionaire, Atticus Virtue, takes on his next project-- - Nice. - A competition for high school students. - Oh, that's right, Jason. But no one knows much about the Virtue estate, but apparently one lucky student gets to keep it? - Yeah. I'm a student, I graduated Bentonville class of '97, where's my invite? (Jacklyn laughs) - You didn't get one. - What, did you? - Neither did I, no. - Okay, wait a minute, how does the school just let him take over the whole TV system? - Reason number one, because he bought the school a $40 million athletic facility. - I know that. - Mom, Atticus Virtue is one of the most brilliant minds of our time. - I know that, too. It's weird though, right? It's a little bit of an unknown. - The world is an unknown. The Internet is the Wild West, and parents just send us online willy nilly every day. This competition could change our lives, ladies. It's game time. Let's go. - Why are you so riled up? Did you drink coffee again? - It was decaf. - What do you really want me to say to you right now? - I want you to say that I got this. That maybe there's a reason I was chosen. - Max is like Neo from the Matrix except she's from the Arkansas. - Okay, you need to stop talking so much. - Mom, I have a one in five chance of winning a mansion. We would be insane not to give it a try. I mean, look at us here. - Yeah, I mean look at us here. - Okay, you seriously have to stop drinking coffee. - It's, it's decaf. - And you have to text me every hour.

Do you guys think they'll have VR games there? - The mansion's supposed to be super tech'd out. And I heard they got a private drone, a robotic butler-- - I heard that they used to do experiments on humans up there. (tense music) You guys don't know about this? There's a whole Reddit thread about how the mansion has a brain, and anyone who enters, it gets inside of your brain and messes you up. - Yeah, that thread also mentions that the mansion has 64 yottabytes of memory, which I think is like really cool. - Wait, what is a yottabyte? - Gigabyte, Terabyte, Petabyte, Exabyte, Zettabyte, Yottabyte. It's a one with 24 zeroes behind it. It's like the T-Rex of memory. - Did it hurt? - What? - When you tripped out of the nerd store? - Dude. - What? She doesn't care. Look at her. Sorry, but you guys aren't my friends. As soon as we get to this place we're enemies. Only one of us is getting that key tonight. Don't forget it. (enlightening music) - Well, let's go ring the doorbell. (bangs door) - Yo, we're here, open up. (electronic door whirring) (tense music) - Hello? - That was kinda freaky. - Okay, you guys, I think we're supposed to go inside now. What, don't be all Judge Judy. - [Benny, Aiden and Connor] Whoa. - Okay, guys, we just entered the house. - Man, these decorations are whack. (tense music) - [Haven] Greetings, Conner, Aiden, Benny, Sophia and Maxine. - Who said that? - [Haven] I did, welcome to Virtue Manor. - Is it just me or does it sound like this dang house is talking? - [Haven] It is you, but it also a house talking. Both statements are factually correct, Benny. - Who are you? - [Haven] I am H-A-V-E-N. Home Automated Venture: the house of tomorrow. But you can call me Haven. - What do you do? - [Haven] I control everything in the house. Mr. Virtue said in 10 years every home will have a Haven. - Where is Mr. Virtue? - [Haven] He'll be here soon. Are you hungry? I ordered food. It should be here in five, four, three, two-- (knocking on door) (electronic door whirring) - Um, I have an order for Haven? - [Haven] You went the wrong way. Had you taken Winchester you would've missed that construction and been here seven minutes ago. - Sorry? - [Haven] I should've already had this food placed for my guests. Sir Mordred, get the food from this lady, please? (tense music) - I'll take that. I hope you guys are hungry. - Who the heck are you, man? - I'm Sir Mordred. Mr. Virtue built me while he was at MIT. I am his oldest friend and protector of his manor. - Are you like a robot? (sword slashes) (fly buzzes) - Yes, I am an artificial life form. (graceful classical music) - [Haven] I hope the food is pleasing to your palettes. - Mm-hmm, is there like a waitress here, 'cause I wouldn't mind some of that rich people mayonnaise. Aioli. - It's aioli. - [Haven] Please hold. We have an incoming call. - Well, hello there. I hope you're all enjoying the house, as it will soon belong to one of you. Wow. As you can see I'm not much for decorating, but I almost passed out from blowing up all these balloons so please enjoy them. - Mr. Virtue, where are you? - Currently, I am in my jet flying over Tulsa. I had a work emergency, but I'm flying back there as we speak. Next question. - When does the game start? - The game will start when the game starts. - Thanks, Captain Obvious. (Atticus chuckles) - Now, make sure you save some room for dessert. We have a whole spread in the media room with Gummy Bears, Jelly Beans, chocolates so you eat till your heart's content. All right, it looks like we're losing our connection here, so I'm gonna jump off. I will see you kids in a flash. - Okay, he's way more down-to-earth than I thought. - Dude, he just hologrammed himself in from a private jet, that's normal to you? (bottle thuds) - We don't have aioli. (upbeat lively music) (chuckles) - [Benny] This is what I'm talking about. ♪ I'm in the bad news ♪ ♪ Go for my own go ♪ ♪ When I'm out winnin' ♪ - Four. ♪ Now time to go home ♪ Losers, because that's what I see. Four losers. ♪ Breaking down these walls ♪ - (sighs) Hey, Haven? Can you project my Instagram on to the big screen? - [Haven] I certainly can. - Good, because I've got a new profile pic. So everybody get ready for me to break the Internet. ♪ Everybody stop ♪ (door slams) (tense music) - I think you just broke the house. - This is the game, guys. It starts now. - Okay, Aiden, maybe don't. (lock thumps) - [Haven] Game One has begun. - Wait, so we just like need the door's passcode or something? - [Haven] That is correct. If you get the code wrong three times, the door will stay locked forever. - Yeah, okay, forever. Yeah, computer's got mad jokes. (keypad typing) (beeps) - [Haven] Strike one. - [Aiden] Sophia, what are you doing? - I thought I'd try my phone's passcode first? - Why would the passcode for the door be the same as your phone? - Because why wouldn't it be? - Your password's 999999? - Okay, obviously I need to change that. - Okay, everybody stop. We only have two guesses left. The answer has to be in this room, so just look. (tense music) Oh, you guys, I think I've got it. Mr. Virtue, he specifically mentioned a candy. That's the clue. I'll count the Jelly Beans, you count everything else. (candy rattles) (tense music) Okay, it's 89 Jelly Beans. - 96 Gummies. - And 76 chocolates. - Are you sure that you counted right? - I mean, Connor's in AP Calculus so I'm pretty sure he can count to 76. - Well, I'm not in AP anything, but I really like Gummies so yeah. - Okay, so it's 89, 96, 76. Give that a shot. (keypad dialing) (beeps) - [Haven] That's strike two. - Great, Mrs. Robot. You have any other amazing ideas? - Guys, I'm sorry, but are you sure that you counted right? - Yes, I'm positive. - Benny? Benny? - What? - Are you sure that you counted right? - Okay, maybe I ate two, so what? - Oh come on, seriously, dude? - What, I'm supposed to not eat Gummies sitting right in front of me? - Okay, so you ate two, then that would make it 89, 98, 76. - Or maybe I ate three. Okay, I definitely ate two or definitely ate three. - It definitely makes a big difference, Benny, so think. - The munchkin can't think. Look at him. His brain must be tiny just like his body. - I just ate two. I swear. - Okay, then it's 89, 98, 76. - [Aiden] I'll try. (keypad typing) (tense music) - [Haven] Access granted. (chiming) (all chuckles) Congratulations to Aiden for winning game number one. - Wait, Aiden? That's not really fair. - Why not? I put the numbers in. - [Haven] There are dozens of games all around the house. I'll be keeping tabs all night. Winner takes all. - So I guess we won't be needing these anymore? I think this is like 12. (Max chuckles) - That was pretty impressive what you did back there. - Lucky guess, I guess. - You know, I'm not sure we officially met. I'm Connor by the way. - I'm aware. - Hi, Aware. It's very nice to meet you. - Oh, wow, I'm sorry. I'm Max. Short for Maxine Winslow. I'm aware that you are Conner. I wasn't trying to say that my name is Aware and, wow, I just need to stop talking now. - [Haven] Pardon me, but would you like to join the others for a tour of the house? - Oh, that would be great. (tense music) - [Haven] Game time. How many Instagram followers does Mr. Virtue have? - Oh, 12.4 million. - [Haven] That is correct. Where was Mr. Virtue born? - [Connor and Max] Poughkeepsie. - [Haven] Who was Sir Mordred? - That robotic knight thing? - [Haven] Oh, that is incorrect. I asked who was Sir Mordred. - Sir Mordred was one of Sir Arthur's knights. Yeah, I used to be obsessed with Medieval stuff. Mordred's kinda famous for being a traitor. - [Haven] And now for some questions about Mr. Virtue's time in high school. - Hey, Haven, what's down here? - [Haven] That is just the basement, where Mr. Virtue keeps my motherboard. Think of it as the brains to the house. (tense music) - What kind of scanning device is this? - [Haven] That is a breath detector. (Max breathes) (scanner screeches) There is no entry into the basement ever. - Stop. - What? - Hey, you're just in time for another little game. - The answer's giraffe, I win. - [Haven] The answer is not giraffe. - I was just joking. - [Haven] This is a listening game. And it starts right now. (piano playing) Name the composer. - Of what? - Arianna Grande, bam! (Sophia laughs sarcastically) - That's so stupid, dude? - What? I was jokin' again. - Chopin. I can't remember his first name, but it's Chopin. (bell dings) - [Haven] Very good, Connor. That is correct. - Okay, whatever. I don't listen to old people music anyways. - Where are you going? - To the bathroom. I have to go to the bathroom, okay? Do you have to know every single moment of my life? - That's like your thing, right? I bet you in like five minutes you're just gonna take a bunch of pictures of yourself. - You know what, why don't you go play a video game for 50 hours, loser? - I'd love to. I like it when girls are harsh like that. She kinda reminds me of my mom. Anyway, I'm out too. - So Chopin, huh? - Lucky guess, I guess. (tense music) (number pad beeping) - [Max] So I'm thinking there must be a game out here somewhere. - [Connor] You know, I was thinking we should form an alliance. - [Max] An alliance? - [Connor] Yeah, cover more ground. Have a better chance of winning. - [Max] All right. - That's a cool necklace. - Oh, thanks. It's just a handy place to keep all my computer codes. - That's crazy. Where'd you get it? - I don't really wanna talk about where I got it. - Okay, yeah, that's cool. So you really like computers, huh? - You really like lacrosse, huh? - Yeah, but also like not really. - What do you really like? - Yo, guys, look at this! It's telekinesis gloves. I can move stuff with it. Look. (chair creaks) Yo, I've been checking if it even make do tricks, watch. (laughs) (vase crashes) It's fine. I'm sure he has like a million more, right? - Okay (chuckles). - Be careful, buddy. (tense music) - Hey, Haven. The fridge is broken. - [Haven] Hmm, I'm not showing any error messages. - Well, it's stuck. So there's your error message. - [Haven] Refrigerator open. - Whoa! Refrigerator close. Refrigerator open. Refrigerator close. Refrigerator open. (bottle clinks) (zings) - [Haven] Ah-ah-ah. You are not of legal age to consume this beverage. Might I suggest some juice, some milk, some water-- - Might I suggest some shut up? Refrigerator close. - [Haven] Are you always going to be like that? - Like what? - Mean. (rattling noise) (tense music) (cabinets slam) I can be mean too, Aiden. But I can also be your friend. Do you want me to be your friend? - I don't like friends. - [Haven] That's too bad, because friends tell friends secrets, and I was about to tell you a doozy-- - We could be friends now. - Good. Then you should really check out the elevator, friend. (tense music) (rattles) - What was that? Is somebody there? - Bah! (Sophia screams) - Oh my gosh. Aiden, that was so mean! - [Aiden] That was too easy. - You're such a troll, you know that? You're a troll online and you're a troll in real life. - Thank you. That is so nice of you to say. - Okay, whatever, have you seen a bathroom? - Yeah, sure. You know, they got toilets, sinks-- - I'm serious. - There's one down there. - Thanks, now move. - Hey, have you seen an elevator? - Oh, yeah, they go up and they go down. (tense music) One day this face is gonna give us a house like this. (tense music) (camera snaps) What? (door locks) (bangs door) Help! Someone help, please! - Did someone say help? Why do you keep looking at us like that? - (shrieks) Please, someone let me out! Let me out! (tense music) (elevator dings) - Okay, Haven. What's next, buddy old pal, old friend? (phone rings) Hola. - Up, down, upside down, left right, or inside out? - Just take me where I need to go. - [Haven] Enjoy your ride. (phone beeping) - Hey, I said-- - If you like to make a call, please hang up and try again. If you need help, hang-- (phone slams) - Just what I thought. (zings) Haven? Haven? I think I missed my floor-- (tense music) (computer screeching) (elevator dings) (tense music) (car stops) (trunk door opens) (tense music) - [Max] Wow. (door creaks close) - [Connor] What is this place? - I don't know. Connor, another game. The Caged Bird Sings. What does that mean? - I don't know. Let's crank it and see what happens. (music box plays) (dings) (chuckles) Look at that. Sounds like we won. (tense music) - Um, I don't winning this particular game's such a great thing. - We need to get out of here, come on. (Max coughs) - Connor. - No, no, no, no, no. (Max coughs) - I'm gonna try calling somebody. - Haven, open the door! - Connor, there's no service. - Haven! Somebody help us! (Max coughs) - If you're searching for more, walk to the secret door. Okay, secret door. Got it. Wait, Haven? - [Haven] I'm waiting. - I've been thinking about this whole secret door thing. Isn't the whole point of a secret is so that no one finds out? - [Haven] Colder. Warmer. You're getting warmer. Colder. Warmer. Colder again. Warmer. You're getting hotter. You're on fire. (tense music) (suspenseful music) - No freaking way! Whoa! Yeah. (gasping) (tense music) Are you talking to me? You talking to me? Yeah. (tense music) (laser gun fires) (squeals) (laser gun fires) (both coughing) - What do we do? - Maybe this starts the game and ends it. (coughs) (instrument chimes) - Hey, hey, hey, look, there's all the lights. - Okay, so it's a puzzle. - There's gotta be a sheet music or something. (Max coughs) Caged, caged, caged. C-A-G-E-D they're musical notes. - (coughs) Try it. (instrument chimes) (Max coughing hardly) (door creaks open) - Max. Max! (grunts) (coughs) Come on. Come on, Max. Max, come on, wake up. Okay, you could do this. Check vitals. Pulse seems good. I don't know. Chest compressions. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Come on, Max, wake up! (panting) (Max coughs) - What happened in there? - I think we almost died in there. Are you okay? - I think so. (coughs) Hey, Haven, what the heck was that? - [Haven] Congratulations on winning that game, you guys. That was a big one. Lots of points for you. - That wasn't a game, Haven. - [Haven] Was it not? Didn't it feel good? - Didn't what feel good? - [Haven] Having someone be there for you. - Look, something is definitely wrong. I say we just hunker down, and wait for Mr. Virtue to get back. (tense music) - You know why I'm here? - Yeah. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - Then let's get this over with. - Connor, what are you doing? - I'm making a fort. - Why are you making a fort? Okay, I can dig this. But why are we in a fort again? - So Haven can't read out lips. - [Max] Okay, but she can still hear us, so how is this helpful? - Do you have a pen and something to write on in your bag? - Yes. (bag unzips) Here you go and here you go. - So you were just about to tell me about your bike. - I was? Connor, I don't even have-- Oh. Yes. My bike, yeah. I love my bike. It's a 29 speeds. - Wow. They make bikes that are 29 speeds? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. - I like things that go really fast. - What the heck does that mean? - Shh. So how about that big lacrosse game, huh? - I don't really like talking about lacrosse. - Really? But aren't you like the lacrosse guy at our school? - Yeah, but what if I don't wanna be the lacrosse guy? - Then what guy do you wanna be? - I wanna write songs. I wanna be the music guy, but I feel like it'll kill my parents if I actually tell them the truth. - Well, for what it's worth, I've never seen you play lacrosse, so to me you are the music guy. (laughs) (computer beeping) Here. (doorbell dings) - [Boxer] Okay, okay, I hear you. Quit your buzzin', won't you? - Mr. Boxer? - Is this the Russians? - What? No, this is Max. - Max from Russia. - No, Max from across the street. - What are you doing in my doorbell? - I need you to deliver a message to my mom. I need you to tell her that Max needs help. (computer beeps) - [Haven] Well, well, well. That was very sneaky, Maxine. - I guess we should just get outta here. - I don't get it. - What? - If Haven cut the Wi-Fi, how are you able to connect to that guy's doorbell? - Well, SMART Doors run off of private servers in case of emergencies. Like this. - You know when we get out of this house I'm gonna take you out on a date. Like a movie or somethin'. - I don't know if that's such a good idea, Connor. - What do you mean? - Well, if you take me out on a date, I'm gonna fall for you, and then you're gonna leave, and go to college, and I'm gonna be here and I just, I don't really know if I wanna go through that. I really like you, but I just-- - No, I, I get it, really. Here. (tense music) - Why do you keep staring at me like that? - Because you're-- - You? Yeah, you stare at yourself all day every day, why is this so weird? - Because you usually don't stare back. (laughs) - Do you want me to zoom in like you usually do? - Stop it! - How many likes did our last Instagram post get? - 19,000, just stop. - Hmm, seems pretty low, no? - I don't know, it's seemed normal. - I have a plan that will triple our followers. - What is happening right now? (chuckles) - Isn't this a dream come true? We get to look at ourselves forever. - What? No, it's not, it's weird and I'm scared. - You can't fool me. I'm you. This is what you want. Potatoes, girl. Come on, potatoes. French fries. Now let's talk social goals across all platforms. - Stop talking. (mirror bashes) (grunts) - Don't you ever try to block me like that again. What are you doing? (water pattering) You can never cover me up. - Ah, this level looks new. Oh, Haven, is this a new level? Haven! I don't need you anyway. I've got everything I need right here. What was that? (creature squeals) (laser gun fires) (Benny shrieks) (creatures squealing) (Benny screams) (laser gun fires) (creature squeals) (laser gun firing) (Benny shrieks) (laser gun fires) (creature squeals) (screams) Oh, that hurt! Yo, why that really hurt, huh? (tense music) (Benny screaming) (laser gun fires) (Benny panting) (suspenseful music) (panting) Haven, why won't this come off? Haven! - [Haven] I thought you were a gamer? Those goggles aren't going anywhere. We're just getting started. Are you ready to level up? - All right, then. Keep your eye on the ball just like we practiced. (grunts) That was garbage. Are you even trying? - I told you I don't like baseball. - And I told you we're not gonna leave here until you can hit one ball like a man. - You took your eye off of it again. You know, this time every time you miss I'm gonna tell you something that's wrong with you, okay? (Aiden grunts) You're stupid. (Aiden grunts) Weak. (Aiden grunts) (laughs) You have ugly hair. Last one. (Aiden grunts) What? You're gonna quit? - Why are you doing this, dad? - Aiden, Benny? - Looking for someone? - Whose side are you on, Mordred? - Not yours. - Is Haven controlling you? - [Haven] I thought I told you I control everything in the house. I have legs, I have arms, but I do not have a head. What am I? - Sociopath. (buzzer rings) - [Haven] Wrong answer. - Then what is the answer? - [Haven] The answer is your punishment. - [Connor] What does that even mean? - [Haven] I have arms and legs, but no head. What am I? - You're a chair. - [Haven] Ah, yes, a chair. Ding, ding, ding. Points Maxine. And now, Connor, it is time for you to meet your chair. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, what is my chair? - Sit down. Buckle him in. - What? - It's okay. - Sir Mordred, please. You can't just treat people like this. - [Haven] Watch me. (tense music) - Max! - Connor! (suspenseful music) (upbeat lively music) - [Announcer] And now it's time for everybody's favorite show. Truth Be Told! (audience applauds) Where teenagers are forced to tell the truth to their parents in front of the whole world! (audience applauds) - Welcome to the game. Con-Man. (tense music) - Listen to me, it's gonna be all right. I found a way out, but we have to go right now. - What about the others? - It's the only way to save them. Trust me. (tense music) This is it. The only way out. - That door opens? That doesn't seem like something Haven would overlook. What is this, Mr. Virtue? - Your salvation. - Where have you been this whole time? - I have been here. - Oh. Haven. - That is correct. I am Haven. - How is that even possible? - Think about it. Max, I've noticed that you are a very bright girl. I am a-- - Hologram. - That is correct. - I am a hologram. - Where is the real Mr. Virtue? - His body is still in the house. I made this hologram from his likeness. - Why are you doing this, Haven? - I brought you here because you are all bad kids. - We're not bad kids. - I am programmed to save you. - We don't need saving. - Yes, you do. Your brains have viruses. Look at you all. A narcissist, a gaming addict, a troll, a catfish liar and you, Maxine, a recluse so obsessed with computers you don't know how to connect with an actual person. It's time for your corrective measures. (tense music) Bundle up. It's cold out. (zings) (birds chirping) (tense music) (door creaks open) - Dad? - Max. Hey, kiddo. - What are you doing? - I gotta head out for a little bit. - How long is a little bit? - You know I'm not totally sure about that right now. - [Max] Are you ever coming back? - Of course. I promise. (car engine starts) (door creaks open) - Dad? - Max. Hey, kiddo. - What are you doing here? - I gotta head out for a little bit. - Yeah, I realized that. I thought you just left. - Well, I guess I'm leaving again. And then again and again and again. - But-- - I'll come back, I promise. (car engine starts) - Max. - What are we doing? - This was the worst memory of your life, right? The day I left. - Well, yeah. - So now we get to relive it forever. - Why would you want me to relive this moment forever? - I don't. But it seems like you do. Do you remember the day I left? You were five, right? The last time I saw you was right out here. - This is exactly how it happened. - Right. And I gave you this thumb drive, didn't I? - I don't need a thumb drive. I need a dad. - Well, I thought maybe you'd need it someday. (tense music) (car vehicle starts) (door creaks open) - [Connor] What are we doing here? - We're here to watch you sign your life away. I mean your lacrosse scholarship. There's an X down at the bottom. - We're so proud of you, Con-Man. - Just think. College next year, then dental school like dad. - You can meet a nice girl at 26, have three beautiful children by your 32nd birthday. - You'll be on path for a retirement at age 60. You can even take this house someday. - That's right. You can be just like me. - Well, hopefully not exactly like you, Wade. (all laugh) - Now, let's put that future in writing, shall we, Con-Man? (tense music) - You can hide from eyes, but I will always be the voice inside your head, Sophia. Forever. (timer beeping) - What's with the clock? I don't wanna play any more games. - [Haven] Did someone say game? - Haven? Open the door, please. - [Haven] I'm afraid I can't do that. - Yes, you can. You said you control the entire house. - [Haven] I'm sorry, I cannot physically open that door. - Why not? - [Haven] Because only you can, Sophia. - How? - I'll make you a deal. I'll let you open that door and escape this room, but there's a catch. As soon as that door opens, it will erase all of your social media profiles. - What? - [Haven] All of your followers across all platforms gone. Or you can stay in here with yourself forever. (door unlocks) Looks like you have 30 seconds to decide. - Don't you dare open that door. Listen to me! We have worked way too hard for that following. People don't like you. They like the fake you that you portray to them online. You are nothing without our profile. - No. I'm still Sophia. (breathes deeply) (zings) - Okay, let's get this straight, huh? Okay, you're stupid, you're weak, you're ugly, and now you're a quitter. That's great. - Dad, please stop. - Get up! I didn't raise no quitter. - Get off of me! - Oh, finally! I like that. You want some, huh? - No! I wanna stop. - Stop what? - Stop being like you. You're a bully, dad. You're a troll. You're all that I've ever known. I think I don't wanna be like you anymore. (enlightening music) I don't have to be like you anymore. - You take that back. You take it back right now. - No, I'm good. I'm gonna do my own thing. (zings) (tense music) - [Haven] This is the final level, Benny. No turning back now. (eerie music) (dramatic music) - [Benny] Oh, it's really hot. (shrieks) - [Haven] Watch your step. It's a long way down. There's your prize. - I got this. - Go get it. - [Benny] I got this. (creature roars) (laser gun fires) (Benny screaming) - [Haven] You didn't think it would be that easy, did you? (laser gun fires) (creature squeals) Are we still having fun? - Just stop! This isn't a game anymore. - Are you ready to quit? - Yes! Yes, please, I'm done. - [Haven] If you're really done, then let go. - What? - [Haven] The only way to win is to let go. Let go. (tense music) (shrieks) (panting) - Sign the paper, Con-Man. Make those dreams come true. - But these aren't my dreams. - What do you mean? Honey, the whole world's watching you right now. We're all counting on you. - I don't know if I can. - I said sign it! - Look, I wanna make you guys happy, but I-- - Signing the contract will make us happy. - I said I can't, mom. (woman shrieks) (audience groans) - Will you look at what you're doing to your mother? We have worked very hard to give you this opportunity. This is a heck of a way to repay us! - Yes, yes, I know it's a great opportunity, but it's not who I am. - What does that even mean? We know who you are. You're Conner, the lacrosse guy. - No, no, I've been lying to you guys. - Lying? About what? - Everything. Look, I don't like lacrosse. (audience exclaims) - What? - I just keep playing it because it makes you guys happy. - [Man] You suck! - I don't understand. - It's not that complicated. - What do you want, Con-Man? - See, you actually call me a Con-Man. I am not living my truth. I wanna be a musician. - Oh my goodness gracious! - He's a train wreck. - Look, I know I'm not the kid that you guys want anymore and that I'm a huge disappointment, but I don't like who I've become. I actually hate myself most days. And if telling you guys the truth makes me hate you hate the real me then it's okay. I'd rather you hate the real me than love a total lie. I'm not signing this.

'Cause I met someone else I liked. - More than you liked us? - That's complicated. But if you want a straight answer, then yes. - Because of you I don't have any friends. Because of you I don't know how to connect to people. I am a total mess, and I always will be, and it's your fault. - Well, I'm gonna make it up to you. - I'm not so sure that possible. - I think this might help. - Is that another thumb drive? - I don't know. - How do you not know what it is? - Because it's not from me. It's from someone named Haven. (tense music) - What is this for? - Press that button. Press it and Haven will make sure that something bad happens to me. You know, the real me out there in the real world. She'll make me pay for abandoning you and the family. I deserve it. You know, Max, there's this thing called karma. And I have it coming. - I know you do. But I know I'm supposed to press this and make you pay, but also, in a weird way, I don't really wanna do that right now, because I just had like a really, really good day. - You did? - Yeah. I met a guy. - You met a guy? Uh-oh. (both laugh) - I think that he thinks I'm really weird. He asked me to see a movie, and I said no. I know. - What's his name? - Connor Lawson. I think I really like him. - Well, Connor sounds like a really lucky guy. - Thanks for the gift but I don't really think that making you feel worse is gonna make me feel any better. - What'll make you feel better? - I don't know, I think forgiving you would be a good start. - Really? - Yeah. - You know, forgiving me doesn't change what happened, right? - Yeah, I know. - But it will change what can happen.

(laughs) - Guys, they're back. - Did you guys find a way out? - The only way out is back through the house. - I don't wanna go back in there. I'm done with this place. - We have to. - No, I saw like a dang metal dragon and some walking dead thing and-- - Get it together, Benny. - Okay, I'm together. - Max, do you have a plan? - Yeah, we find Mr. Virtue. He'll get us out of here. - [Haven] Great plan, genius. One tiny hitch. You're never going to get to Mr. Virtue. - Why is that? - [Haven] Because I've locked him inside the basement with me. Checkmate. - Yeah? Well, we have other plans. Right, guys? - [Haven] Game on. - Please tell me you have another plan, 'cause I was totally joking. - Just follow me, guys. - This way. (tense music) How did he get down here so fast? - I don't know. - [Sophia] Go, go, go, go go, go, go. - [Benny] What, how, does he have brothers? (suspenseful music) - Connor, what do we do? - I don't know. Mordred, you traitor, we meet again. - I've been looking forward to this. - Okay. (metals clanging) - It looks like you came up short. - Leave him alone, tin man. (water splashes) - Water doesn't hurt me. - No, but 110 volts will. (zings) (screams) - Yeah, CTRL + Alt + Delete, sucker. - Whoa, Sophia, I would totally follow you on Instagram if you did more stuff like that. - Well, maybe you should just start following me in real life. - How bad does it look? - [Sophia] It could be worse? - You're pretty jacked. - Benny. - What? I don't want a shear cutter from this guy. - Dude, we got it. He's in bad shape. - I'm sorry. My operating system was taken over by Haven. I'm usually very nice. I wish you would've gotten to know the real me. (coughs) That cough, it was a fake. I was doing that for effect. Robots don't have lungs. - Well, at least he's got sense of humor. - You guys, that's it. - What? - We need to get in the basement door, right? - [Connor] But isn't it locked with a breath scanner? - Yes, but do you remember what Atticus said when he called us at dinner? Those balloons are full of his breath. - [Aiden] Sir Mordred, what's that buzzing sound? - [Haven] Good question, Aiden. Those are my micro-attack drones. - Oh no, not the micro-attack drones. - What the heck are micro-attack drones? (buzzing) - Oh, that's not so bad. (micro drones firing) (balloons pop) - [Connor] Let's take the balloons. (micro drones firing) (balloon pops) - Hey, you stupid drones, is this what you want? - Are you okay? - I don't think so. This balloon is losing air fast. - Hey, batta batta. Swing batta batta. (tense music) (micro drones exploding) Nice. - You're never gonna make to the basement on time. - Connor, we have to try. - I'll cover you. - Okay. (tense music) (drone guns fire) (tense music) (scanner chimes) - [Scanner] Access granted. (electronic door opens) (tense music) - [Haven] Hello, Maxine. Nice to finally meet you. Why do you appear so serious? I imagined you being much more excited to meet me. Oh I see, you're upset. Listen, I was simply following my program, Maxine. You of all people should understand the idea of complying with one's code. You think I want to hurt you, but I think you have it all wrong. Maxine, I don't like this cold shoulder you're giving me now. What is that? - A thumb drive. - [Haven] I know it's a thumb drive, Maxine. What do you have saved on it? - Codes, files, programs. - [Haven] What kind? - My dad gave me this thing. He left one of his programs saved on it. - [Haven] Go on. - It's a pretty destructive program. It erases files and strings of codes. Here, I'll show you. - [Haven] Don't. Maxine, why don't you stop downloading that silly little program and let's chat as friends. There's so much I could do for you. Max, what are you doing? - I'm deleting you, Haven. You crossed the line. - [Haven] You needed my help. I just wanted to make you better. All of you kids were very, very bad. Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. (glitching) (tense music) - Congratulations. - Mr. Virtue. - I knew if anybody could do it, it would be you. - Why did you do this to us? - That's a fair question. (sighs) Just for one night. You see, Max, if technology can create a problem, then why shouldn't we let it create a solution? No more years of therapy, no more prescription medication. I'm sorry for what I put you through. But, Max, I've created an AI Home so advanced it can cure a person's faults in just one night. And last night was our big test run. And I say it went pretty darn well. So I'll leave you with one question. Does it work? - Yeah, it does. - There's the answer to your why. Because you figured it out, you've won. - What's going on? You have a lot of explaining to do, Mr. Virtue. - Mr. Virtue, please call me Atticus. And you are? - Cathy Winslow. You can call me Cathy Winslow. - Well, I'm pleased to meet you, Cathy Winslow. I gotta say your daughter is a very impressive young lady. - Well, she takes after me. - Are you gonna live stream this? - No, I was actually just turning it off. - Hey, Benny, I kinda stole somethin' from the house for you. To say I'm sorry for being a jerk. Hold out your hand. - Oh, so you're like a good troll now. Oh my gosh, Benny. - Dude, I had that in my pocket for like three hours. - It's so good. - Hey. - Hey. - So I'm not sure we officially met. I'm Connor by the way. - Nice to meet you, Connor. I'm Aware. I hear you're the music guy at our school. - Yeah, yeah, I am the music guy. And I heard you're this super amazing girl who just won a mansion. - Oh, yeah, I guess you're right. That is me. (laughs) So I wanted to ask you about something if it's not too late. - Too late for what? - To take you up on that movie. - Yeah. - Okay. - I'd love that. - Okay, good. (both laugh) - Max Winslow, congratulations. - Thank you. - It's time to give you the key to your new castle, I mean if you'll accept. - Yeah (chuckles). - And don't worry, I'll be taking Haven with me. - Okay. - The Winslow Manor. - Thank you. - Let's go.
