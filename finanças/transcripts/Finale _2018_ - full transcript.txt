How do you do! Mister SÃ¸ren Juul Petersen feels it would be a little unkind to present this film without just a word of friendly warning. We are about to unfold the story of "Finale." On the surface, a story about two Danish girls working at a gas-station and their predicaments during a night shift. But deeper down, it deals with the boundaries for good entertainment and the morbid curiosity of the human mind. I think it will entertain you. It may shock you. It might even horrify you. So, if any of you feel that you do not want to subject your nerves to such a strain, now is your chance to, well, we warned you. Welcome to Denmark. Land of fairytales, hygge, and home to some of the happiest people in the world. We will do our utmost today, to change all of that. Benjamin! Belinda! Is anyone there? Hello! Honey?! I'm right here! Belin... Belinda! Can you hear me?! Hello! Hello! Is there anybody? Hello? Pleasure and pain. A blistering blend of the nightmarish. We'll be prepared for time and place, an alternative path to the strongest aspects of everyday life. ...and is everybody ready for 2 hours of nail biting excitement? Ready is an understatement, Jan. Since Denmark made it to the final- - people have really been ecstatic. But it's really gonna be a thriller. But the Danes are really confident in front of this fantastic event. It's a showdown that's sure to leave the streets empty. But Niels, any thoughts about the game itself? Yeah, I fear it's gonna be fierce and brutal. Please don't pick me up too late. - There's a lot of packing to do. - No, no... All the guys have to go to work tomorrow... Will you listen to the game on the radio? No, I better work on my thesis... I'll lock myself up in the back room, and let Belinda manage the shop. - Oh dear... - Yes! Yeah, my faithful companion here is on it's last run, You know, when I get that job in Hamburg, we'll buy a new car. IF you get the job, honey! Don't you think I'll get it? Sure I do. You speak German really well now. Yeah, right. Easy now, 'schatzie'... I'm just kidding, honey. Sure. Well, remember to call the real estate agent. I'm outta here. - Bye. - Bye. Have a nice shift. See you soon. Have a nice game... give my best to everybody! - What about the pump? - You'll have to fix it. Benjamin! We'll pick up the keys on Wednesday then. Hi, Agnes. Yes, at 3 PM, I've noted. Okay thanks. Goodbye. Hi Belinda. I thought we'd finished working together. Me too, but I promised my dad this last shift. - I'm sure we'll have fun. - Yes. Please fold the boxes properly before you put them in the trash... Yeah, sure... By the way, the car wash door is stuck again... I'll take a look right away. Hi K. What are U doing? Fixing stuff. And U? At work with my bosses stuck up daughter Drop by if U want. The car wash door is working again. I want to watch the final, but maybe I'll drop by. We might as well close... No one will come as long as the final is on... It is pretty surreal that Denmark ended up in the final. Was that your boyfriend before... in the yellow car? Yes, that's Benjamin. He just graduated as a doctor. Why? Don't you ever get annoyed with him sometimes? Trouble with your boyfriend? Not really, besides him being a jerk now and then... Maybe it's just me. This evening will be so boring. I'll bet you an ice cream, that we won't get more than three customers. Okay, deal Help me K. I'm so bored. What are you majoring in? Psychology. Skills in high demand around here, with all those lunatics running around. Kenny should really answer my messages. Don't you think? Any psychological thoughts on hopeless boyfriends? I'm sure he'll get back to you. Why don't people clean up their own mess? There you are. What are you doing? Why don't you answer my messages? Yes, I'm still at work... No, I'm not gonna be a webcam model. Working here helps save up money... Belinda, what's wrong? - What happened? - Just a whole lot of stuff lately. Here. Shit. I thought I heard you laughing a minute ago? What happened? It's my mom... She told me to pack my stuff and leave. Right now? So you live at your mother's place? Yeah. I had to move back in with her last winter... Now she wants me to leave Kenny... and she told me that... That either I drop him or I have to move out. I've already canceled my own apartment... Here, have some water. I think she's jealous of me having a boyfriend. And she looks retired. You seem a little too old for living with your mom? Yes, but after my last boyfriend Patrick, I had no choice. I had to move back. What is the problem... why doesn't your mom like Kenny? It's really stupid, she... I'll handle it. Agnes Berger? Sorry, do you know me? - Are you German? - No no... I speak a little German. It's your name tag. Right, sorry That'll be 355 Danish kroner. Oh, I also a need a gas cylinder, thanks. Yes, no problem. Then it's 1159 Danish kroner, or 156 Euro. That's expensive! My Goodness. Uh mm... I'll pay by card. You seem to have entered an incorrect PIN code. I'll pay with cash. You'll get your change in Danish kroner, is that okay? Okay. - Here you go. - Thank you, Agnes Berger. Oh, do you know what the score is in the final? No, I don't know. Aren't you watching it in the back room? No. - Okay. Thank you, Agnes Berger. - You're welcome. Don't forget your gas cylinder! Hey, Agnes! Guess who texted me and will drop by in a minute. My best guess is Kenny? Bingo... I need the key to the bathroom so I can clean up. Thanks. Do you want something? Don't do that. She doesn't like it. We're just fooling around, I hope you don't mind? Your friend is right. I DO mind, thank you. My friend? Who? Him? Are we friends? Stop it. I want to pay for these and the gas. Then it'll be 186, thanks. And here we see our hero paying for the gas and Cokes... To the beautiful gas attendant... Agnes Berger... The girl from the gas station here in...? Where are we? Beautiful, please inform your customers in this desolate part of the country... - Where are we? - Can you please just go now? Yes, we're leaving now. But we're just fooling around... There's no harm done. Leave now! Otherwise, I'll call the police. Oh! And what would you tell them? "Hi, it's Agnes from the gas station... someone is filming me!" I'll go now, but... Why don't you give me your phone number? You seem like a nice girl. Otherwise, I can't tell you when I upload the clips on Youtube. Agnes. Sorry if I crossed your line. - Okay? - Goodbye for now! It's not just me filming you... there are cameras everywhere. Weekend weekend, for you and for me and for you... Yes. Have a nice evening! Did you see the woman? Which woman? The woman in the back seat, with duct tape on her mouth. Duct tape? You mean the two guys who just left? Yes, there was a woman in the back seat with duct tape on her mouth... I honestly don't think so... They weren't exactly charming, but I would have seen that. There was a woman in their back seat with duct tape on her mouth... How did you even see that? The bathroom window is facing the other way. I saw it on my way out. Fucking psychos, man... Do you realize what types like them can do? No, but I'm sure I would have seen this. So because you didn't see it, it didn't happen? Yes. I saw her! I think they've drugged her or something. I saw a movie once about a psycho who kept women trapped in his basement. He tortured them in the sickest way... Belinda. You shouldn't watch movies like that.... Fear distorts reality... Okay, then let's call the police. We don't want the police running around. Kenny will be here soon. What's up with Kenny and the police? Benjamin? Benjamin? Agnes! Agnes, come watch this! What is it? The air pump. What's up with the air pump? It's in the middle of everything... So what? Some customers probably forgot to put it back. What customers are you talking about? The guy with the gas canister or the ones with the woman in the back seat? What do I know, but it didn't get there by itself. It's pretty strange... I've already put it back once before... It's very strange... There is something very strange about this. Someone just forgot to put it back. - Who would that be? - I don't know... If you are playing a prank on us... I don't find it funny at all. - What's up? - Not much. Where's your helmet? Where it belongs. What's wrong with you? It's my mom. Fuck her. She told me to move. Why? You. Because of me? Yes. That really sucks. - That's Agnes. - Hi, Agnes, Kenny here. Good looking girl. Are you high? Hey, are you high or what? No, I'm flat out broke. Who's gonna pay for that Coke then? I don't know. Don't all shops have a bit of loose change? Honey, there's a camera right there. You're busted. Maybe I can borrow some money from you then... I need a 1000 Kr. Are you kidding me? No, I really need a thousand... You know you'll get them back. I don't have a thousand you can borrow, honey. - What about your credit card? - No, I can't spare a 1000. Dammit man. Don't be so selfish... I really need this from you. - Give me the money. - Why aren't you watching the final? Fuck the final. I have other things on my mind. Who do you owe the money? What do you need it for? - Someone who wants it... - Who? Someone leaving town, who likes to get his money. - I have 200 Kr. - I'm 800 short then. I haven't got anymore. Use your credit card to get some cash from the register? I can't do that... - Can't you get some money? - No, I can't. Great. Great. That's really great. Bitch! What did you say, honey? I said 'see you honey'. Are you okay? Yeah. I don't want to talk about it. It's just one of those days. Right, I'll be in the back room. Is something wrong? I just started missing you. That's too bad, but the referee has just stopped the match. - Why? - You won't believe this... The game had just started when 5-6 naked people ran into the field. People will do anything to get on TV... Yeah, we're really getting our moneys worth. But I'll probably be a little late. But not too late.... Is Belinda troubling you? Yeah, among other things. Luckily it's your last shift tonight. Is someone picking Belinda up after you close? I don't think so. Ask her to wait with you and we'll give her a ride home. Are you serious? Yes, then you won't be alone. No.... I'll check with her. The game is about to start now. Bye now. Yeah, see you later. Belinda? What wrong? They're back. The two guys... who filmed you. Where? They're waiting up there. What are we going to do, Agnes? Take it easy. No need to panic just yet. I once experienced a robbery... when working at the large gas station by the freeway. It was two junkies... and they behaved just like this. Stalking us before entering the shop with knives. What did you do then? Gave them the money and called the police. I really wanted to beat them up myself, but I didn't. The usual rules... just give them the money and call the police. How did you feel afterwards? I felt all right. Nothing really happened. A psychologist came asking dumb questions... But I wouldn't talk. No offense. Don't underestimate psychological help... Fuck! They're coming now. Very strange behaviour if you want to rob a gas station. Agnes, they're not here to rob the gas station... What are they doing then? It's us they're after, Agnes. You really SHOULD see a psychologist. He's got something in his hand. Benjamin... honey? Honey! Who are you? Who are you? My dad has money... Is something wrong? What can we do for you? We were here earlier... buying Cokes and gas. Yes, I remember. We haven't had many customers tonight. No, I can imagine. What do you want? I lost my Visa card - maybe I left it here? No. Didn't you pay cash? Yes, now that you mention it. Well, I'd better close the card then. Have a good evening both of you. Wait a minute! Yes? Who was the woman in the back of your car? What woman? There was a woman sitting in the back seat of your car earlier. She had duct tape covering her mouth. It wasn't a woman. What was it then? It was a sex doll. It was the guy with the camera's suggestion. A friend is turning 30 today, and he wanted to give him a sex doll. But the friend wasn't home, so we got stuck with the doll in our car. I think I'll be on my way then. Have a good night. Agnes! It's back again. It wasn't there when the car left. I'll put it back. Agnes! You really scared me, Belinda. - I saw somebody in the car wash. - What do you mean? I saw somebody... Is it smoke? Is there a fire? Ladies and Gentlemen, we start tonight's experience with some Pre-show pressure. Our session begins with a little hands-on exercise. We've warmed up our main specimen and put some of her senses in the dark. But let's be silent and leave the rest to body language. Don't cry, Agnes. It's only showbiz. I promise not to kill you. And neither will anyone else. Unless you ask me to. Or beg! Who are you? I don't like this, Agnes. Easy now. It's probably just a short circuit. Whoever wrote this is really sick in the head. The surveillance files can probably show us who wrote it. Shit, we don't have access to that. What are you talking about? The surveillance recordings are locked in the back room. The files are protected, so criminals can't get hold of them. What should we do then? I have to call the police... ...and call my dad because he has access to the surveillance files. You won't believe this... What is it? There's someone out there. He has something in his hand... He's filming us, Agnes... Kenny? What? It's Kenny for Christ's sake. Kenny! What's up you two? - Are you completely insane? - What? What's happening? Did you think it was for real? That's really funny. No, that's wasn't funny at all. I'm calling the police now. Take it easy now. It was a joke. Don't call the police. Stop that, Kenny Don't call the police... Don't call... What are you up to? Stop that! Yes, I just need to send this... Stop it.... You scared the shit out of me, Kenny. I thought you would find it funny... Some fun.. It wasnât funny, Kenny... not at all. What about the paint in there? It's vandalism. I don't think so. Listen, I said I'm sorry... It wasn't my idea... I don't want your excuses. What were you thinking? I got really scared, Kenny. It's not okay, writing what you did in there. Listen Belinda. I came to you because I'm broke... I needed a 1000, but you didn't help me. You wouldn't help me... Shut up when I'm talking to you. Then this a guy offered me a 1000 to make a video and send it to him. So, now I don't need a 1000 anymore. This is too far out. I'm going inside. - Now she's pissed. - I'm tired of your stories. I need you to leave. - Right now? - Yes, now! - See you later? - I won't even answer that. We'll see each other later? I don't know about you, but I'm going home now. I'll text my dad about what happened and we'll close down for tonight. Okay... What's on your mind? Our shift ends in less than two hours... And I have to wash that paint of the wall! If your dad hears about this with Kenny, I'll be fired on the spot! Okay. Maybe I overreacted... But the thing about Kenny getting a 1000 to scare us - I don't like it. No, but Agnes, he's full of shit, just forget about it. You're still defending him. I actually got really scared! I know. Well then... Let's get that paint off the wall? We better hurry before it all dries. And now we have customers... It looks like you'll owe me an ice cream. There's no one here. And there's no car either. Maybe they went round the back. Why would they do that? Before we fully start to unfold our tantalizing main performance, we need to close in on our divine diva. Our Ringmaster is a determined conversationalist. Dying to dive into deeper dialogue with our starlet. He masters the art of oral examination. Let's let our lion roar, shall we? It's time for more Pre-show Pressure, as we break bread, and Meet the Meat. Please state your name? Please Agnes, let the audience get to know you a little bit. What is your name? Agnes Berger! Agnes Berger. How old are you? 29. 29? 29! Your audience would like to know more about you, Agnes. Apart from working at a gas station, what is it you really wanted to do with your life? Psychology. Psychology! Fantastic! Ladies and gentlemen, we have a psycho with us tonight. So, Agnes Is that your boyfriend sitting over there? Hmm? You see, he's our first act. Ladies and gentlemen, Let me introduce our star for the evening, Agnes Berger! Tonight, is a very violent show! A very sad tragedy. A horror circus. Our most enthusiastic audience are close at hand. Sitting front row. And by magic of the internet, we have cameras over here and here, two in the back, one behind you, three over there, two over here. There's cameras everywhere. Say hi to the audience, Agnes. Hello. No? Hello, hello, hello. Let's try this again, shall we? Hello. Hello. That wasn't so difficult, was it? Why would they go round the back? - You have called Benjamin... - Ah, voice mail. I'm busy so please leave a message... Hi Benjamin, it's me... I was wondering if you could you pick me up now. Some very strange things are happening here... ...Hurry up, bye. It's a bit like being in a prank on Youtube... This is way too creepy... If that's your boyfriend again... The time has finally come to pull out the spotlight and burn a hole into the darkness. Our evenings three-act performance is ready to begin. Let's set the proper atmosphere. Wonderful. Sit back or lean forward friends because it's time to spin The Wheel of Misfortune. Ladies and gentlemen, time to get things rolling with act one, the appetizer. Wakey Wakey. Rise and shine. It seems our friend has dozed off. Let's see if we can wake this sleeping beauty. There we go. All dressed up and ready to play. Welcome to the, oh boy boyfriend. Let's see his luck or should I say un-luck on our Wheel of Misfortune! Orange no less. What does orange remind us of? Fire perhaps? Maybe a little fire. Agnes, do you have a campfire story you'd like to share with us while we roast your boyfriend over the open fire? Things are heating up, ladies and gentlemen! Oh, blue! Red was hot. Blue must be cold! Yes, maybe something to drink. Let's get your engine running. Please, no! Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's been fun, don't you think? Fired. Got a refreshing drink. But sadly, I'm afraid, it's time to end act one. As we expose new levels of dark human texture, let the soothing audio sugarcoat your experience. Please, let him go! Please, let him go! Please. Please, let him go. I do appreciate the effort you've brought to the ring. But timing is everything, and we can't leave the audience hanging. We need closure! I think you're ready for takeoff, my friend. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that about raps it up for act one. Shall we end the scene with a little bit of inflight entertainment? Ta-da! Belinda? Yes. Do you have your phone? Get it ready. Who should I call? Call the police. You have reached your local police station outside opening hours, please wait... Kenny. Get me away from here. Hello, police officer Petersen here. Kenny, what happened... Kenny! Kenny, you're bleeding. Kenny? Kenny? Get ready... I'll be there in ten seconds! What the hell? What's going on here? What are you doing Agnes? - What's wrong? - Kenny's on the floor... ...he's been stabbed and there's blood everywhere! - In there? - Yes! - No, don't go in there! I have to. You said there's a man in there! I'll be back in two seconds... Stay here, and I'll go check on him. What happened to you? I think he's dying. Hi Belinda... My name is Benjamin and I'm a doctor. I'll take a look. Okay, we need to stop this bleeding. Belinda, can you get me those tissues there? Yes, that's fine, just give them to me. That's right. I just need my... Where the hell is my cell phone? Do you have a phone, Belinda? We really need a phone, so I can call for an ambulance. Belinda! Hello? My phone is in the back room... Don't you get it... they are still here! Agnes! Agnes, are you okay? I'm sorry... They're coming! I forgot to lock the back door! We need to lock the doors. Belinda, you'll lock the front doors... Agnes... I can't leave him right now... Please go and lock the door in the back room... - and get me Belinda's cell phone so we can call an ambulance. Right now, Agnes! Hold on Kenny... Okay, the door is locked now. Benjamin? Belinda? Benjamin? 911. It's Agnes Berger... I'm at a gas station and someone has been stabbed... We hope you have enjoyed the first act. A riveting experience which calls for a short, necessary intermission before we proceed with act two. We encourage you to stretch your legs, before we carry on with the show. I believe you two ladies know each other. Agnes. Agnes. He killed Benjamin... He simply just killed him. It's the guy who bought the gas cylinder earlier this evening. He is filming us. There are cameras everywhere. It's some kind of sick show. It's fucking snuff, Agnes. I think there's an audience in there. There is. You'll have to untie me. - Get me out of this chair. - What if they can hear us... ...or see us or something? We're alone now. The cameras aren't zooming right now. They zoomed in and out before. They're silent now, so I think we have some time. - You have to untie me now. - Okay. Okay, I'm trying. Come on, Belinda, hurry! The intermission is coming to a close. We are ready to commence with act two. Where we'll get the chance to witness our two maidens respond to the requests of our audience. Let's not wait around anymore. This is The Killer Confrontation. I think I'm ready to start act two. Agnes Berger, why aren't you tied up anymore? Did your co-star untie you? Down! Well, if you're not going to answer, I guess we can play along. You remember how good your boyfriend looked with this? I'm sure you look very pretty too. Maybe there's even some of his saliva left on it? Good girl. Fantastic. Now look up! There you are, very pretty. Now don't lose your light! And you, my girl, I think you've earned yourself a price. Belinda, I'm going to need you undivided attention and participation. Do you understand? Yes? Good. Now, do you remember this from the gas station? Yes, buckle up and feel for the camera. I understand it stings a bit, but I'm afraid we have run out of anesthetics. Get up. Quick! Keep looking into our eyes. Aren't you marvelous. Tell me you like it! - I like it! - Yes. And so do we. You look much more collected, gathered, But we've promised some audience participation. So, ladies and gentlemen, let's start tonight's request, shall we? What would our front row audience like to see? Let your imaginations run wild! So, our front-row audience would like to see some relationship bonding. Let's see how we can make this escalate, shall we? Do you remember this from the gas station? You used it to cut open boxes. Yes? The more you say no to me, the deeper I'll cut you with it. Do you understand? Good, very good. Now, you know how to use a stapler, don't you? Take it. There you are. Let's see what we can do. How about we stick it in her arm? Shall we do that? Maybe she need one on her hand? The right one. Go on then! Go on, do it! That's a good spot. Nail that in there, do it! Yes! Now how about the face? Let's see the nose. Do the nose! Do it! Do it! Put it in there! There you go. Wonderful! And maybe the neck, what do you think? Shall we do the neck? Let's do the neck! Do the neck, go on. Do it! No, no stop. Wait! I have a marvelous idea. Oh, this is so good! There it is. The most important thing in showbiz is getting your name in the spotlight. Now let's see if we can make a lasting impression on our audience. Yes? Good, maybe we'll let them see this better. Now stick it in there. Stick it where it's supposed to be. Do it, yes? - No. - Do it! - No! - Do it, do it or I'll cut! I will cut you to shreds! Yes, there you go, stick it in there! Do it! Do it. There we are. Wonderful! Now close it so it stays there! There you are! We're having a magnificent show tonight, aren't we? How dare you interrupt my show? Please keep calm! Organize and leave calmly. What the hell is this place? Let's go up. We can't run from them. We have to hide. - Yes? - Have you found them yet? Not yet. They are trapped in the west wing. We'll have them in a minute. Indeed. Despite the unexpected ending the show has been a success. The front row audience is satisfied. But you need to finalize the girls and get the Ringmaster caravan ready for disposal. Yes, we understand. I'll search the rooms, you'll search the garage! They'll be back soon. We have to get out of here. Shh... Quiet. Agnes! Agnes! Weekend, weekend, for you and for me and for you! Listen sweetheart, the final is over. There is nothing left to fight for! - Belinda, where are you hit? - My... My shoulder! Can you get up? We have to jump out the window. You can do it. Land in the bushes, I'll be right after you. There's no one there. I can't go on anymore. Yes, of course you can, Belinda! I'm cold. Just run. I'll wait here. No, listen to me... Let's get you into the caravan, and I'll start the car and get us out of here. I still owe you that ice cream, right? Great. Damn! Belinda! The door is locked, we have to climb the fence. Belinda? Retire to the Ringmaster for his efforts. Escapismus looks forward to seeing you again at the next performance. Preparations have already begun. Don't forget to download artifacts from this evening's performance Agnes... Agnes come here. You have to run. Run really fast. No. I won't leave you. You have to run and get help. - I'll be back, I promise. - I know that you will. Where's the other girl? What's your name? Do you speak German? Can you tell us what happened? Are you in any pain? Let's check your blood pressure. Okay. Her pulse is good. You can relax now, we're here to help you.
