People of Bhutan, I have advised the government to stop all taxes on personal income. This should make you happy. The introduction of TV and internet in Bhutan is a true sign of Bhutan's modernization and development. But I would like to caution the youth of Bhutan. The TV and the internet, in its news and programs, has contents that are both harmful and useful to you and your country. For this reason, we must be very careful and selective in using this new resource. Nevertheless I have decided to allow the access of internet and TV in our Kingdom. I hope this will bring great benefits to the people of Bhutan. Nothing I have ever said until now has made you applaud. I had to introduce TV and internet to get applause. My dear beloved father Let there be no worries in your heart Instead let there be happiness and peace Who am I going to live with in this world? Who am I going to live with in this world? Mother, when you harvest barley, does it cut your fingers? Yes, sometimes. Mother, let's swap sickles. If we swap, you might cut your hands. Mine's even sharper. - No worries. - Mine is less comfortable. You're funny. How can you harvest if you keep swapping sickles? I saw workmen carrying electric poles in the valley. - So did I. - They're making fast progress. They've also started working on the road. In a few years, tourists will be visiting us by car. - We'll have electricity next year. - You're right. Youngsters will have a better life. But I'm worried about the electricity bill. I hope it will be reasonable! Brother, I asked you to come so we could discuss something. Is suffering with me. I feel that Peyangki I want him to join the monastery. I think you're right. It could be useful for the family, too. You should take him the day after tomorrow. I was planning to take him tomorrow. - Take him the day after tomorrow. - OK. It'll be an auspicious day. The rain has stopped. Yes, brother, it will be cold today. Winter is about to begin. Did you look after the yaks well? - Did you count them? - Yes. I put them in their pen. Can I burn this? You're always playing with a ball. - No, I'm not. - I don't know about that. I need to talk to you about something. Yes? I'm thinking of sending you to the monastery so you'll become a monk. What do you think? I don't want to. I can't afford to send you to school. You'll be very happy in the monastery. If you go to the monastery, I don't have to spend anything. Once you're a monk, you'll get food and clothes for free. You can benefit me and a lot of others in the future. Right now, I can't afford to send you to school. And when you're older, it will be even more expensive. I won't always be here. You'll have to look after yourself someday. - You want him to become a monk? - Yes. Why? He'd be better off in school. He doesn't want to go to school. I see. You think it's better for him to become a monk? Yes, sir. OK, that's good. - There's no need for that. - Please accept it. It isn't necessary. Change his clothes then. You won't change your mind? Some parents take their child back home just after a month. I won't. He'll be very fortunate to be here. I have two daughters and four sons. Their father passed away, so it's very difficult for me. You can come and visit me. The house isn't far away. Serve the Lama with full dedication. Listen to him and do as he says. I trust in you completely. Be a good boy. Prostrate yourself three times. With full dedication. Pray for every sentient being. Pray and promise to serve every sentient being. And to overcome any obstacle during your study. May I be a good devotee blessed with every wish. - That's all. - Thank you, sir. Peyangki, it's time for me to leave. Be a good boy and a dedicated monk. Good luck. It's time to go and herd the yaks. Yes, uncle, it's time. It will be difficult after dark when we can't see a thing. Yes, uncle. After dark, all we can do is curse the darkness. I'll sell a yak in the city and buy a TV with the money. That's smart, you'll be ready when the electricity arrives. People will love watching TV. You can even make money with your TV. People will come and pay to watch it. In the city, they have different kinds of TVs, big and small. Try to bring back the biggest one! A big screen will be more entertaining. Much more entertaining. If I sell a yak, I can buy a TV too? Yes, if you manage to sell one. Then I should do it as well. If you go to the city... there are lots of places where you can sell yaks. I also want to sell a yak to buy a TV. I'll watch it and my kids, too. I want my own TV. Then I can leave them at home. Baby, do you want to watch TV? Then I can go and herd the yaks. It'll be great like that. Compassion comes from the transcendental wisdom... the transcendental wisdom... the transcendental wisdom... of all the Buddhas, past, present and future. The transcendental wisdom... Tell Khorey to come. Sit. We used to be eight monks, now we're three. The other five left for the city and I don't know why. Maybe for studies, the TV, electricity, or other comforts. They probably had their own reasons for leaving. They say it was to study, but who knows their true motives! Do you have a desire to go to the city? Yes, master. Why? We want to watch TV. - You expect TV to make you happy? - Yes, master. Is that so? What you see and hear on TV can influence a mind negatively. Our ignorance of worldly ways has allowed us to stay focused on studying prayer and not doing bad deeds. If ever you meet the five monks, they may tell you that it's great to be in the city, because of the TV and the delicious food. But don't listen to them, they've been badly influenced. Only stray people leave for the city. So if you stay and live here, you'll become a good person. Prostrate yourself. Light the butter lamp. Put it over there. - Must I cover my mouth? - Yes. - Let me do it. - OK. You must do it properly. You'll like this place. You'll study all day long. It'll be useful when you grow up. It's hard for our teacher to always be here. He has to do the rituals in the village. But we can wake up early and study hard. Why did you join the monastery? My father died. So my mother decided I should come here. She has to look after the yaks. How come your dad passed away? He encountered a bear. - A bear? - Yes. He was alone in the forest when he encountered the bear. He had a heart attack and died. So your mum sent you here. Otherwise I'd be alone when she takes care of the yaks. She said I'd have a better life if I joined the monastery. That's how I became a monk. It's good that you came here. How many have you cleaned? Almost three. Only three? I've only cleaned two. Can I count yours as mine too? I thought you'd clean them all. I'll let you win. I don't see what the problem is. He doesn't understand. Tell him to come up here and see. We can't go through houses, it's simple! It's not like on the map at all. It's a big mess. A big mess. So you finally bought a TV! Yes, it's very fragile and difficult to carry on a horse. It fell off, I think it's broken. I should hit you for not taking care of such an expensive thing! Whatever you do, you're useless! Why are you always like that? I'll never be able to watch TV now. Please calm down. I'll buy a better TV next time. I'll buy a better one and we'll enjoy watching it. Like this... No, like this... Your lips a bit higher and blow. Try to make the same sound as me. Move your lips up a bit. Keep us safe. What's that? I don't know. - Are you happy today? - Yes. Do you like playing or studying? Studying. If you like studying then study. - What kind of wife do you want? - A goddess. - A goddess? - Yes. And you? I don't want a wife. - You must have a type! - No. - Then I don't want a wife either. - You said you wanted a goddess! Because you asked me. Otherwise I wouldn't have said. - Liar! - You're the one who's lying. You're surrounded by beauties. There's no escape for you. To me, it's a river full of stones! But if a goddess makes you happy, that's OK by me! I doubt I'll find one. Kids like you always want to find a wife. But I'm not interested in such things. - Not interested? - Let's sleep now. Compassion comes... from the transcendental wisdom... of all the Buddhas past, present and future. Compassion comes from... the transcendental wisdom... The transcendental wisdom... Stop bothering me! Just let me sweep! What did you say? Shut up! - I'm trying to scare you. - I said shut up! Why would I be scared of you? I'm not listening. You sound like an idiot. I've given all my love for you I'll keep faith in you Your beauty is everything to me Hands down! Students, attention! Hands together, pray for wisdom! One, two, three! Om Ara Banza Na Dhe Affectionate Buddha May the rays of light of your supreme omniscience Clear the darkness of naivety from my mind Use Thinley's bow. Thinley, give him your bow. Thinley's bow is stiff. Pass me the bowl - Do you guys like school? - Yes. What about the monastery? No. It's no fun. School's fun. Monks aren't supposed to do archery. I sneaked out of the monastery. I love archery and I'm not allowed to do it there. So I sneaked out. Archery's fun, isn't it? Oh, right. A bull's eye and you lose your points! Hey, that's my bowl - Where does Nupchu live? - Near the herding place? We were meant to join school together. - Hey, guys! - What? - This is my bow, right? - Which one? The one he's holding. He's trying to take it. Monk, go pray instead of mining my weaving. My dear beloved father Let there be no worries in your heart Instead let there be happiness and peace Who am I going to live with in this world? This little boy keeps playing with my loom! I'm not a little boy. I'm a big boy now. Your brother's going to get married. Mum, I want to leave the monastery. Where else would you go? The Lama beats me. His wife may not let you stay here anymore. You don't have a father. Things may become difficult. It's best if you stay. Then I want to change monasteries. If you go elsewhere, it might be the same thing. Please stay where I sent you. Alright? It's for the best. You're too young to think of going elsewhere. - I want to go to Gasa. - Maybe in 4 or 5 years. Once you've finished your studies, you can go elsewhere. Right now, at your age, how can you leave? I'll go to Gasa. Gasa is very strict. You may not be able to cope with the discipline. If you go to Gasa, I'll have to travel far to visit you. And you'll miss me. But if you're nearby, we can meet from time to time. Why the grief-stricken mood? Come on, be strong. If you go, we won't be able to meet, despite missing each other a lot. You nearly fell into the fire! It's really burning. The fire almost burned your back. What are you thinking about? Mum, can I sleep here tonight? I want to stay here tonight. OK, then. I'll take you back in the morning. - Where did you come from? - From the monastery. - Is the Lama there? - Yes. Does he let you go out like this? No, he doesn't. I asked Mum's permission. Is the Lama there during winter time? No, the monastery's closed. The Lama goes down south. You can go as his helper then. No, I can't help him. I'm not at ease with him. - Monk? - Yes? Do you want to go down south with me? Yes... We'll take a yak to sell it over there. I don't know if Mum will agree, but if so, I'll go. Why not? You can study down there. And no herding yaks! - Do you want to go? - If I'm allowed, yes. But... Mum may not allow me to go. I'll talk to your mother about it. Don't worry, OK? Soon, there will be too much snow here. It will be very cold. So if you want to go, let's go in about three days. - Why are your trousers so tight? - I'm freezing. You should button them looser. I'm feeling better now. I'm leaving soon. When you're in Thimphu, you'll be able to see your sister. Do you want to visit your sister in Thimphu? I don't know. - Would you like to see her? - Yes. - Really? - Yes. During the day, your sister will be at the office working with computers. I don't know if you'll be able to meet her. Maybe she has days off. I'm sure she'll take a day off to see you. You're right. She must be able to take a day off. Hold the soap! You can't even hold the soap! Come closer. May our journey be a success. May you protect us from illness. Bless us on our journey. Bless us on our journey! I brought this yak from Laya to sell it. It was really hard to lead it here. So I see. I'll be happy to sell it to you. It looks good and healthy. It's a good yak. If you're interested in it, I'll sell it to you. Cash in hand for 15,000 nu. OK, OK... I get you, but 15,000 is a bit too much. If you really want it, I'll sell it for 13,500 nu then. If that's the price, I'll buy it. It looks healthy. It's good and healthy. It's turned really cold on the highlands, Mr Kinley. We had to walk three days from Laya to get here. Now, Mr Kinley, pray well for the animal. Pray that it benefits me. - OK. - Here's the money. It's all there. Count it yourself. It was a good deal without too much bargaining. I went to Tibet to buy a TV. Really? But on the way home, it fell off the horse and broke. When I told my wife, she went crazy and started yelling. We argued about it. That's why I brought the yak to sell. With the money, I can buy a new TV. I have to think hard about how to get it all the way up. - True, true. - No way can I break it. Look at that man. - Is it a real man? - No, it's a mannequin. How can a man look real if he's not? The cars come and go, it's never ending! They keep going up and down. They have to, they can't drive straight across. - Why? - They can't go straight. - But why? - Traffic rules. - Where are they from? - From down there and up there. Stay here! Let's take this motorbike and escape. Ride, ride, ride... - What happened to him? - He's just drunk and sleeping. What are those things? How do they help him walk? He leans on the handles and walks. - Where do his legs 90? - In the middle. Do his legs 90 through here? One for each leg. - How does it work then? - He has to jump. - What? - Walk and jump. Come on, let's go. Don't eat too much. If you eat too much, you might throw up again. - Is it tasty? - Yes. - I'll buy you another one later. - OK. It's ten nu. Ten nu for an egg too. Ten plus ten makes... a lot! Now Ray Mysterio. The unique style of Mysterio. Rhodes puts on the brakes. Ooh! Oh, look at this. And Ray once again taking out Cody Rhodes. And here comes Mysterio... Uncle Kinley, is it real? It can't be real, but I'm not certain about it. If it was real, they'd have killed each other. No, it can't be real fighting. They'd be dead already. Alberto Del Rio is looking to fulfill what he feels is his destiny by becoming the world heavyweight champion here at WrestleMania. And, gentlemen, as you see in the background, that is a portrait of his estate in northern Mexico... Sorry, but there's no one called Choki working here. Sorry I can't help you. OK, thank you. She's not here. So what now? Mum told me she worked here. His mother told him she works here as a computer operator. There's no one called Choki in my section. She might be working in another ministry or office. Thank you. I should call Mum. I think you should. - OK, let's call her. - Yes, call her. Hey! Mum, I can't find Choki. We've been trying to find her for a few days now. Mum, can you give me her friend's number? Your blinking lights are beautiful. They are. - You like them? - Yes. Are the fish artificial or real? They're real, kept in a tank. - How do they survive? - In special water for fish. - What about food? - You put their food in the tank. It's so interesting to be here. - Do you like being here? - Yes. Where do you sleep? Here. - So you live here? - Yes. - So you sleep here? - Yes, we have to sleep here. - You don't go out? - No, we have to stay here. Sister, can I tell Mum that you're a club dancer when I go back home? I thought about calling her to tell her about this, but I just couldn't do it. I used to work in an office, but later I came to work here. - How is Mum? Is she OK? - Yes. Will you go back home someday? I want to visit some temples before going back home. I'll go back to the village in two weeks' time. Did you enjoy being in the city? Yes. - Did you get car sick? - Yes, very sick. So sick, I didn't even realize we'd reached the city. So you could only visit it the next morning? Yes. That night, I couldn't sleep. - Did you like it there? - Yes, I did. There must be a lot of shops. I bet you wanted to buy many things. I wished for many things. Wishes alone won't help. You have to work to get what you wish for. - Did you see your sister? - She was hard to find. Really? - Is she working? - Yes. Good. But I had a hard time finding her. She's working in an office. She delivers letters here and there. Did she tell you... whether she'll come back soon? Yes, she did. - Was she happy to see you? - Yes. I must go. - You came back at last! - Yes. - How shall I cut your hair? - What? - How shall I cut it? - As you like. - I'll cut it short. - OK. Ouch! - There's hair on your clothes. - That's OK. I can wipe it off. Will my hair look like it's been eaten by a rat? No, don't worry. Your hair is so rough. - When did you last wash it? - I don't remember. You should wash it more often to make it softer. OK, I will. It's too cold here to wash it every day. - I heard you went to Thimphu. - Yes. - How long did you stay? - A long time. - Did you like it? - Yes. - Was it your first time there? - Yes. - Who did you go with? - What? Who did you go with? With my Uncle Kinley. I also went to Faro. Sit up straight. Please don't cut my ear. Don't worry, I'll be careful. Almost done. - Ouch! Ouch! - Sorry. You have to bear a little pain! I'm going to leave soon, you know that, right? We know. After I leave, the monastic body will try to send you a new teacher. So behave, alright? - Are you happy I'm leaving? - Not at all. - Now don't lie. - We're not happy at all. Well, I'm not going too far. I'll be in Punakha... so we may meet again. There are those who dwell in the mud and rain, but it will be different for you. Happiness and peacefulness is having a shelter to protect us from rain and sun. We shall meet again in the future. Now I'll hand over the monastery to you two. Take good care of it. Always light butter lamps and offer holy water. Do that and your life will be blessed. Del Rio obviously thought he had Edge. And he did have... Look at this! Del Rio didn't want... Oh, my! Once again. He's gonna do it! Del Rio's gonna do it here! Alberto Del Rio closed into cover. Edge put his foot on the bottom rope. Ricardo made sure of that. - And... Uh-oh. - Christian. Oh! - Watch it! - Oh, man! 80, Christian... Oh, man! Fallaway slam by Clay. Del Rio took his eyes and attention off of the champion! Oh, Del Rio kicks again. Edge, the ultimate opportunist. Tried to take one there from Del Rio. Oh! Oh, look at the eyes of Edge! Look at those eyes! - Edge going for the spear. - Del Rio side-stepping. And Brodus Clay... Oh! To the injured arm. Edge's arm, off the steel post. - Alberto Del Rio cross armbreaker. - It's over. It's over. Del Rio's gonna steal the World Championship. Edge is gonna tap. Edge is gonna tap. Wait, wait, wait. Edge, his hands locked. If he can keep them locked, he can keep some of that pressure off.
