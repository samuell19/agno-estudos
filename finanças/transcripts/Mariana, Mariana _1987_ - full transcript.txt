The past is a foreign country. There things happen differently. Dedicated to Pepe Estrada, from all us, who though, planed and made on his presence (and lack thereof) this film. ...may your mortal remains rest in peace, and may your eternal soul be welcomed next to the creator. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. All old fellows are gone, Carlitos, your boss is gone, then it's our turn. -You have transportation, Carlitos? -Yes, yes, thanks. I'm glad you came, Carlitos. Auntie, how are you? Long time no see, Carlitos! -Carlitos, meet me at your mother's house. -Thank you. We'll be expecting you. You rented it? Yes, at the airport. Wow, you're just like before, strong, you haven't lost your hair, nor a cane. Gee, how you doing? You see. Let's see, who am I? -I know! Who am I? Well, you're... I guess you don't remember, it shows in your face... Ah, no, no, do not worry, I'll take you anywhere, I'll tell my driver to change the tire. Well, man, thank you very much. Hell, Carlitos, I'm Rosales! Rosales? Rosales... "Bastard" Rosales , so has named me your brother Hector. Because if you lower your guard, then you've just screwed. Look at me, I entered the big bussines, we can do business together. And here I am, I started so low, and now I'm in prosperity. Oh, wrong fuck, pass me by, asshole. This city is a real chaos, hey, in Caracas there are this kind of mess too? Remember the asshole Mondragon saying that in the eighties this would be a heaven? The mushroom cloud. Although the war ended three years ago, we are still afraid to think in the most powerful weapon of all times, the atomic bomb. But the atom is not all bad, children, its force can be used for scientific purposes to help the humankind progress. Within 40 years you're going to live it. I, who knows. We will live in clean cities, no smoke, no waste. Each family will have a completely comfortable and ultramodern house, we'll lack nothing. We will be aided by machines They'll do all the work. With nuclear power transportation will be much more fluid, we have a unique future. But, look at the map. See, no wonder Mexico is shaped like the horn of plenty. In addition, we have large beaches,... You do not understand English, you Indian ox. -You'll see, Canijo Rosales. -Let's see, what are they doing there? What are you doing? What have you got there, Jim? Bring him here. -No, teacher. Why not?, I'm not talking to you. You shut up. Come on, bring it here. Come on, Jim. Fast. Where did you get this? They send it to me from the United States. From U.S.? See you tomorrow! A strawberry ice cream, please. At four, do not forget. I have to ask permission. -Bad thing. -Surely they'll grant it. One strawberry, please. The one with the granting of these devices will become millionaires, no doubt. How do you name this thing? -Blender. -Why so funny? Because it blends. Madam, can I take away the water? Yes, put it on the table. It's beautiful, isn't it? And for sure the owner is a petty politician. Miss, Serve me a glass of water, please. Yes, young man, of course. So, ma, do you grant me a permission to go with Jim to the movies? Okay, but provided Isabel goes too. You, unplug and wash it. Not me, ma'am. Do not worry, Esteban will pick me up at 3:30, but let's go. You think that he is so big? -How many? -Four, please. Thus, this Juarez downtown conducted by the Directorate of Pensions and that opens the country's president in the company of... -Sir, please turn off your cigarette. -Yes, sir, forgive me. is an important step in solving the problem of popular housing... -My father! -Who? My dad, there by the president. There was my dad, did not see him? Yes, yes. Jim's dad. Jim's father is very important, working in government, with the president. There he was. No, Esteban! Nobody gets out to my sister, you hear? Hector Quickly, quickly, it's going to stop. It is in English, you do not understand. It's pure Carlos' lies. If Jim's dad was really that wealty politician Jim would live in a house in the Lomas. So who is the real father? He was a gringo reporter who took Jim's mother to San Francisco, he never married her. -And Jim was born there? -Sure. That's why he's a pocho! -Then the mother of Jim...? -Jim's mother is the mistress of that politician. His mother is the mistress. Stop gossiping Jim! We were not gossiping anyone. I hear you, Carlitos. Chinese, Chinese, Japanese, eat cheese and do not give me. Waters, because he knows "juditsu." Right now comes to our program a boy who begins to emerge as a singer... What, you scared? Stop! What were you doing? Ah, I know, you are training to beg. Clown! Well, were abusing yourself, then. I think that's it. What do you care? Hey, you saw the new kitty? Ah, yes. Horse meat, good and cheap. Get up everybody! Come on, lazzy, up! In the spirit! "Two floors." Two flowers. No, "rooms", "floors." "The first and the second" floor, "rooms", living. Son. No thanks, enough is enough. And you, you eat all your food or you'll be squat, eh? Hey, I saw that you and your brother didn't leave together, not yet spoken? You do not want to talk about it, no? Sorry, you are a nice fellow, man! Yes, this man so handy for business the dirtier the better, that Catholic gentleman, father of 11 legitimate children and four bastards. That great master of the extreme right wing knight of Columbus ex porro that defrauded his own father... -Withdraw, old women! An old woman you had to be, go sew socks! Enough, let's talk about something else. Do you remember when I broke my nose because of pocho Jim? By the way, you know what a pocho is? Pocho? Yeah, man, a pocho is a son of a bitch who thinks he's a gentleman. Yeah, man, I broke my nose because of Jim, when we played these games, men, Arabs against Jews, remember? How we named it? The "battles in the desert." Sure, the "battles in the desert." Suicide mission, Al Qaeda. Yes, sir. Suicide mission! You prefer, cream pie or shell with Chinese beans? Nothing, I bring my sandwich. Come on, I have not taught. At the bombs! Attack! Who is it, eh? Here is the President and here is my dad, here he looks much better. Well, I say. At the bombs! We won! We are the best! And you what? What about what? Why you never play the "battles in the desert? -Queers! -Queers! Boys, a fight! Come on, hit it! Children, still, kids! You, quiet! Let's see, you, come here. -He's an Indian, teacher, he started it! -Shut up! Shut up, no need to insults, you will see what will happen to you, eh? Here are your school implements, Rosales. Yours, Jim has them, eh? Here are the examination tests, sir. Ah, yes, give them to me, thanks. -See you tomorrow. -See you tomorrow. Well, well, well, you can go. Ah, Carlos, I want to talk to you, do not go. And you, wipe your mouth, eh? Do not go out into the street looking so. I want you to understand me very well one thing, Carlos: being poor is not a defect. Nobody is to blame for their economic situation. In addition, the Indian word should not be used ever, -you hear me? - Never as an insult. In this country we are all Indians. You may go. -See you tomorrow, Don Lucho. -See you tomorrow. Thank you. For what? You fought for me. -It was for us both. -Anyway, thanks. ...and a hundred. I've finished. Let's see. All right. Mom, I can get a permit? Jim invited me to tea at her home on Friday. Jim? Who is Jim? My friend, who knows much English. Come on, Mom, give me permission I'll arrive before 8:30! I do not know, I'll think, I don't like you to meet anyone, you know, "Tell me who you meet..." Our family, when we lived in Guadalajara... I know, you just hung out with high society but in this filthy city of Mexico... Yes, yes. Although you say it in jest. Your father hos no money for us but he does for other expenses. "Lamp of the street..." Poor child, you happened to be in a school for pure poor! And this is my home. Look, this is the Buddy. The string trick! Jump, ma'am. Truncheon brats! But, how you dare to make fun of that lady? You know who she is, Jim? It's Mrs. Madero, none other than Mrs. Sara P. Madero widow of the great hero of our revolution, not right! Sorry, Don Sindulfo. I present you my friend Carlos. Come on, Buddy. You'll see, Carlos. Go ahead, Buddy. Oh, he almost opens the door. You bring keys? Yes, my mom does not like to stay, she goes out a lot. Buddy, go fetch Mariana. "Toad runs..." Right now I come. Remember Jim's mother? You're Carlitos. Yes. Well, nice. Come on in Jim's room, in a while I'll prepare the snack. Hurry! Go, Buddy, go with Mariana, we want to play alone. Do not bother me. And these are all my toys. I did not think you had so many. Look, I'm going to show how the string works. Carlitos, Jim, come on a picnic. Buddy. Buddy, get away, that's my place. They are named "flying saucers" easy to cook, "flying saucers." Ideal Bread, ham, cheddar cheese butter, mayonnaise, mustard and ketchup to taste. Put ketchup. Jim told me a lot of you, says you're his best friend, right? Sure. I love you both get along so well. And you have siblings? Yes. Brothers and sisters? Three sisters and a brother. And you were born here in Mexico? No, they're from Guadalajara, but... What a brute! Oh, excuse me! -No, do not worry. -Excuse me! It's nothing, either way I would change. Well, I'm going to change, because they will pick me up at eight. I put the corn to the knee. Do not worry, take your "flying saucer." -Mariana. -What? That you name your mother Mariana. Sure, Mariana, and you? Me? How you tell your mom? Mom, and I talk to her with respect. Really? And she talks with respect to my grandparents. Hey, and how is Tequesquitengo? You knew, Mariana, you'll believe? Carlos does not know Tequesquitengo. Really? It is fashionable. We are building there. Let's see when we are honored by you joining us. We go there often. I would love you come with us. That's what I say. Does it look, eh? Gorgeous, Mariana, smells good! Thank you. You know, Carlitos, here's your house. In Campeche 22 is yours. Thank you. You behave yourself, James? Who is it? I have come. Is it time? I asked permission! Yes, but not to stay until nine at night, you've had me with the soul on a string. It is 8:45! It's the same, and do not correct me, kid. You do not just stay up this time on the street also have the nerve to reply. I do not like your friendship with that someone Jim. I was talking about this with your aunt Luisita the other day. That's not decent family. His mother is a woman -How do you explain it? - not married to that man. It's like the saying goes: her "Second front." Understand what that means? And the man also has his "third front" and "fourth front", etc.. Listen, son. Your sisters and I we will go to Guadalajara for a few days to see Aunt Licha. I trust that the men of this house will behave. Hey, then, go to bed now, tomorrow you go to school. As high the sky in the world would be, as deep the deep sea would be, there'll not be a barrier in the world a deep love can not break. Love is the bread of life, love is the divine drink, love is a thing without a name that gets a man obsessed for a woman. And that music, romantic, you, self-abuser? What, your dick already erects? Stop! No matter how hard fate opposes you will be mine. For as high the sky in the world should be, as deep as the deep sea would be, there'll not be a barrier in the world a deep love would not break at last. Child, do not put your hand there, there are wires, you'll be electrocuted. I'm obsessed with you and the world is witness to my frenzy, No matter how hard fate opposes yo will be mine. What are you doing? Come on, boys, attention, let's see. You, out there, you can see up here? You do not shade each other? Yes, you, Toru? Let's see, attention. Much attention, eh? Well, hush, hush now. Everybody looking here. Well, today you have the opportunity, for the first time in your life, to witness a live experiment with this animal. In this rabbit I have applied chloroform so it is sleepy and you can see the experiment. He will not feel, the rabbit is already asleep. And I will open so you can see -Look here, you, do not be disturbed, there- can see the entire digestive system of the rabbit. Let's see, see, he will not suffer, he is perfectly asleep yes, with chloroform, asleep, and once ready we proceed to make with this knife open so you can see the whole apparatus digestive tract of the animal. Let's see, attention, let's see. Once ready... You know? Mariana liked you very much. She says you can go home whenever you want. We will proceed to a longitudinal section, look. Yes? He had an attack! Carlitos! He fainted! Quiet, quiet, nothing happens, this usually happens. Let's see, Carlos. Go! -You call me then, eh? -Yes, Mom. Yes, I'll call you on arrive. Do well, Mama, greetings to the guys. -They behave well! -Goodbye, Isabel! Behave! We love you! Well, now, we are the pure males. You might even throw a straw in the air, pa. Here you are. -Two packets of stamps. -Yes, one moment. -Two packets of stamps! -Yes, one moment. Here they are. The makeup lady! Again! What happened about Tequesquitengo? We leave this Saturday morning. You can hold Laurel and Hardy. Tequesquitengo, yeah, man. Advantage that your mother isn't here, I'll go with you to ask permission from your dad. See, this is what we do. Where is my father? In the office. But they are going to sink us, with ads, with the great advertising campaign they are spending on this crap they are going to chase us out of the bussiness. It sucks! No, no, pure second hand chemistry, man. It's sandpaper for clothes and hands! Look, with the propaganda these gringos sell everything and if it's crap they sell it anyway. I am not to accept offers of these gringos. Whatever. Why not eat in Pr?ndese on Thursday? Yes, thanks, on Thursday. Goodbye. What did you want? About Tequesquitengo. What? Jim's parents invite me next week. To Tequesquitengo? Yes, tell me who this is? Hello. Yes, tell me. I have a lot of work, yes. Wait a minute. I am very busy. What do you want? Go to Tequesquitengo. Come on, sir, give him permission. It's the weekend, I do not miss school. Well, OK, I give you permission. Thanks, Dad. -Thank you, sir. -Nothing. You're going hime for dinner? How can I go dinner, you see how busy I am, child? Come on, behave. Hello. That had been. As you say. Sure. You're Flash Gordon. Finally captured the terrible Carlos, right? Let's do Chinese torture. Okay, That's why I missed my ribbon. Ah, right, then, let's untie him yes, yes, yes, for us all to go into the water. Yes, sir, water ducks! -Jim, let's cope with the terrible spectacle man, yes, yes, Jim! -No, no, no! -Be brave! -I can not swim! He said he can not swim. Alright, quiet, quiet. Easy, easy. You okay? Lady, sir has just arrived. -Thanks. -Do not want me to help you? No, thank you, sir. You okay, sure, Carlitos? You okay? Do not go, do not go! I'll be back. Take me every night to your garden and sit with me among the roses. Tell me, for pity's sake, those things that make beat my already dead heart. Let me tilt my head... Carlos! If you saw, when my Buddy comes, we're up there, up there. -Why do not you bring him? -Because my father is upset if I bring him when he comes. ...and I've been born again because you love me. You remember the magazines we read on the sly? The Baudeville, Best, the Pigalle... -No, I read the Billiquen. -The Billiquen. World cinema. Carlos, Carlos, Hector was grabbed at Clara's room. Let's go? Let's see them! You dress up and leave this house, slut! No, ma'am, please, I beg you, no! And you're a crook, Hector, how many times I told you? Casanova! What are you doing here? Hurry up to your room! And you, go away! -Oh, damn, dress up! -Madam, please! Dress up! Get out, gossips! What makes me angrier is that he backed at the precise moment. She was just getting so soft when, zap, she began screaming. Mean kitty! This is the pen, "atomic pen." -Atomic? -Does not stick or leak, but smells like lightning. -Why? -It can explode like an atomic bomb? Can! Everybody to the ground, it's going to explode! What happens here? What happened? Everyone to their places, fast. Come quickly. Come, quick, quick. What happened? Jim brought an atomic pen. And we hear a pop. Is the atomic one. As in Hiroshima, no? -Yes. -But, don't be fools. How awful! Those things do not explode. I had heard of them. Do not bring those things here, which only cause disorder. Take it to the principal's office, come on. Quick! This is the subjunctive past perfect tense of the verb love. It is a very difficult time, pay close attention. I would have loved. - "I would have loved." -Well. You would have loved. "You would have loved." He would have loved. "He would have loved." We would have loved. "We would have loved." Alcaraz, not just the tune, but lyrically, eh? We would have loved. "We would have loved." You would have loved. "You would have loved." They would have loved. "They would have loved." You want to conjugate it alone? No, I leave to go to the bathroom. Well, go, do not come late, eh? Let's see who's the brave who want to conjugate it alone? -Let's see how many are there? -I, master. I would have loved. You would have loved. He would have loved. Carlitos, what happens? Something happened to Jim? Jim is right. I need to talk to you. Come in. Do not tell me lies, Carlitos, really nothing happens to Jim? It's another thing. Let's see. You ran away from school. If they caught me I'm out, don't tell anyone I was here. Neither Jim. Nobody. Is something wrong at home? -You had problem...? -No. No. -You want an" orange "? -No. I want nothing. What I want... I came... Forgive me. I came to tell you that I love you. The reason I came. I understand you very well, Carlitos. I really understand you very well. Now you have to understand me. You are a child, like Jim, and I could well be your mother you understand that, Carlitos? I do not want you to suffer, so many bad things await for you in life like everyone. Take it as fun, as something you can remember with joy, no hard feelings, know? As if nothing had happened. Forgive me. No, I have nothing to forgive, the contrary. Wait. Wait, Carlos. I can ask a favor? First turned on, mom, and then strongly supports against the floor. Done. As a purring cat. Look, Mom, is supposed to be strong supported forward and softly back. And this switch, what can it be for? -It must be for the reverse, no? -See, look. -Let's see if it says there. -Okay, let me see. This one here is to turn it on. I do not know where it is, I don't find it. Carlitos! What are you doing here so early? Hey, and your school implements? Look, you see? They've just brought it to me, it's a marvel. I'm going to pay for it in part payements. It also cleans faster. I want to see if I can take out the trash. I think we understood it very well. Here, hard. Carlitos, bring a newspaper, quick! -Oh, how much dirt! -Yes, don't let it fall down again. And it seemed that now was not so dirty. Carefully. That's right. Look, an earring that I had lost. Look at how much dirt! Well, it's easy, I think we understood perfectly. They do a horrible scandal down there. -Who? -He came, your teacher. A horrible scandal because of you. As he was not returning from the bathroom we went to look for him, and we realized that he had escaped from the school. I saw him. Yes, and then we learned that he had been in the house of Jim's mother. I told them, I guessed, since that trip to Tequesquitengo I knew. Tequesquitengo? What trip to Tequesquitengo? -That he did with... -Yes, I spoke with her, because she had said... You're going to see this woman? Yes, I spoke with her. She was very cautious, but finally agreed that Carlitos had been there to pick up a book, or something, but Jim says it is not true. I do not know, ma'am, all this seems very strange so I came to see you. Hello. Is something wrong? -Carlitos committed an atrocity. -What? Where are you? Do not hide because it will get worse. Get out. Get out, I say! Casanova! No, no, you take him out. I never thought you were capable of anything so horrible, Carlitos, never! When you've seen bad examples in this house, uh, when? The only thing that we considered is that you were a good child, and see with what you came out. Answer. Answer. I think what I did was not so bad, Mom. And you say that cynicism to say was not so bad you put us to shame. This kid is not normal, must be sick in the head. Do not you remember when aged six months he fell head first into the square Ajusco? Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom Thy will be done on earth as in heaven. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. What else? Nothing more. You have not told me the details. She was naked? No. Wasn't she naked? Sure? She was wearing a Chinese gown, red. There was a man in the house when you arrived? No. Sure? Surely not, father. And you think, you think before she open the door she committed a dirty act? A what? A dirty act. How is it? A dirty act with herself, a bad thing. I do not know. Do not know what are the sins against your own body? You've never had bad touches? Bad what? Rubbing your own body, son, you know very well, when you get to tearing out there to cause stroke. No. You did not? No. I say all this because we must be alert, child very alert. For the work of original sin the devil is the prince of this world and puts us traps to force us to fall. In addition, you can become stupid. ...I want you next Tuesday. See you on Tuesday. -One moment, Azucena. -Calm down, Azucena. Ready. How weel I did? You give this to your parents, is the appointment with the psychiatrist, tomorrow at six o'clock in the afternoon. Now, look carefully, I'll show you a series of drawings. You'll watch carefully one by one and then you tell me what you think, what you see in each one. Two horses kissing. A kiss? And you, what do you think? Two ducks dancing. Yes, two dancing ducks. A very large bird, flying. And that? You are growing, you have to feed. -But mom... -Don 't listen to your mom. Eat in your room and be quiet so she does not hear, eh? Well? So you sold the factory? But yes, the gringos! But I will be manager. But we do not own it any longer. No, we do not own it. Your brother Hector has not come? No. Well, come on. Carlos, wait for us out there in the chair at the bottom of the corridor. For me it is an Oedipal problem very clear, intelligence is far below normal. No, the guy is very smart, wise, extremely early. Early, I agree but very overprotected, is very submissive. The results are very clear, look, doctor, castrating mother... Jocasta. Father weak. Agamemnon. His sexual identity is not clear, surely there is a primal scene. The boy went to this lady's home to see if he found her with her lover. Could be. Hardship of both parents, acute feelings of inferiority. That's not very clear to me, because the boy is suffering from early storytelling. No, no, it's a very candid guy, to make up fabrications, no. What happens is this: the boy is identified with the victims, with animals with his helpless friends. He's in search of affection he doesn't find in the family constellation. So basically we agree. Basically, we could say yes, Doctor. Will you? You want me to call the parents? Call them, I will talk with them. I told you, I never liked that school for Carlitos. It is a very decent one. If it were a decent school, they have not admitted the son of... a public woman. Do not exaggerate. Pure immorality. Look, immorality is not only in school, it's in the country, everywhere. But I tell you one thing: Carlitos does not return to that school. Well, and where are you going to put him? Oh, I do not know, we'll have to look. But for now, you heard the doctor: he needs a club. Plenty of sunshine, clean air, a lot of sport, a balanced diet: lots of vegetables and little meat. No meat! He could enter Guay club it is a very good club. But Protestant. No, I'm going to put him at the Vanguards, with Father Perez del Valle. And that was all, the kid Canijo released over the old woman. Hey, and how well she is, eh? Good! Great. do you know Rita Haywood? With that I say everything. -Well, well. -For this. Well, don't let the gringo fuck you when he grows up, eh? Grown up? He will be damn little guy because of self-abuse. You got to it? Almost almost. It is not important. It's okay if you begin fucking from now on. So you clean the jacket, or else it's going to grow a testicle boy here in the hand. Ah, just like yours! Although you can not yet, you throw yourself, go ahead. We were lucky, Carlitos, we were lucky. Amid so much sisters, queers we could have become, and you just can see, quite the contrary. -Yes, indeed! Now, I can tell you one thing, fucking kid, beware of this guy, eh? Lest he realizes and you trow you his gunmen and then yes, he'll break your face! Do not panic him. You, Suck, you earned it. The second truck, train. Please note, I want the line in order. Keep silent, gentlemen. Candy vendors well away from the boys. Carlos, Carlos! I saw you! I saw you! A peach, quick, quick! Rosales?! Rosales! What was it, Rosales? Do not you remember me? -Sure. -Then, why you run? Because I thought you were mad at me. Angry, why? Because... of our quarrels. Quarrels? Who remembers? Now you're here in this school? You, too, you left school? Yes, after you. Last year, my dad got sick, and I had to get to work, in this. But do not grieve, help your oldies working is very nice. I invite you a banana split at La Bella Italia, agree? No, better invite me a cake, I had no time for breakfast. Done. I suffer your absence I do not deny, I can not live if you're not beside me. Hurry up, asshole, you have lead in the buttocks, or what? Shit, this is to shit with your coat on! I also invited you to lunch, remember? And we talked about Jim's mother. I understand that I love you very much Well, Canijo Rosales, tell me that of Mariana. You really want to know? It was awful, really scary. They say that one night at a big party there by Lomas was the mother of Jim and that man. Then Jim's mother uncovered herself and began to speak ill of politicians, theft in government and how they squandered the money taken from the poor. The man did not like to be embarrased in front of so many people, and slap her, and even shouted that she had no right to speak of honesty because she was a bitch. Jim's mother then got up, took a book and went home. On arriving, she opened her veins with a razor blade. The next day, Jim found her dead, bathed in blood. All that you're saying is a lie, truth, Canijo Rosales? Pure true. I would have known, I would had seen it in newspapers. The man did not want any mess in the papers but at school we all learned. Do you want? Mrs. Mariana? Does not live here no lady Mariana Morales family lives here. How long you live here? Two months ago we moved. What a weird name, how did you said? Don Sindulfo. No, never I would remember. Of course, I started here as a doorman just last year. Why not ask at 201? Since 1939, to be exact, but to my knowledge, has never lived here a lady Mariana. And Jim, a boy my age? The only boy your age is in the 402 and is named Everardo. No way! Must be in another street, in another building. -No! -Forgive me, but I have the rice on the fire. You do not know what horror was that all about for me I was always doubtful about what you told me. About Mariana? Yes, about Marianna. It was the plain truth. How I can have nostalgia for that world? You know your house was demolished? And they demolished the school, they nearly demolished the entire colony Rome for parking and condominiums. And then to finish the shit, and as a tip of the top, came the earthquake. Yes, like a tip of the top. There they destroyed everything, the end of our world, and nobody cares, as if it never existed. I still live in this infected city because... because here is the Polish and the money, if not... That world, as you say, no longer exists. But you exist, Jim existed, Mariana existed. Buddy, Buddy! It is not named Buddy, it's named Rommel. He's named Buddy, and he's Jim's, my friend. It's named Rommel and it's mine. How long have you had it? Who gave it to you? I have him since he was a puppie. Rommel!
