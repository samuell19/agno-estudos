Check over by those trees! ---Dogs barking getting close--- ---Scream--- ---Tires screeching---Crash ---Horn Honking---Surprised gasp.. ---Horn honks again---.. Moan.. ----Car starts---...sigh... ..Responding to this overwhealming national and international interest in this story.. Emily. I asked you not to put those everywhere. It's really hard for me to get those off the furniture. It isn't on the furniture You know what I mean. I made pancakes I'm not hungry. Mom. You need to eat. Honey I'm fine. Accross the city that the news has been the same. As people have waited for hours only to be told that the supplies of the flu vaccine have run out. Twelve people have died from this particular strain Updating who has died from the virus from this season alone. State health commisoner Paul Astronik addressed the issue last night at a press conference. The state house and commisioners office are doing everthing in their power to insure the saftey of the public. We have been in contact with the centers for disease control and we are assured that the matter is being addressed on a federal and a regional level. You know I don't know why they don't just make more vaccine at the hospital I mean you do have labs there don't you? It comes from the CDC mama. Well they should send more. I'm sure they will. There's a lot of really sick people. I think that's enough news for this morning. You look tired sweetheart. I'm fine. Hey. Am I late for breakfast? Dad you made it. We have to go I can't be late again. Emily. Slow down. Okay? There was a long line on the bridge, that's all. We have lots of time. ---Sigh. Clears throat---Sighs again-- I um... brought those with me. Thought it would save you a trip. Dad look! It says I love you. Wow! That's really cool. Where'd you get the book? Grandma got it for me. She's helping me out with my volunteer work. This says petition for sole custody. Amy. Not here please. Look..Amy, your still gonna have full dissertation rights. Okay? I just think that under the circumstances. Circumstances? It says here that I'm an unfit mother. That's harsh. I know but there's no other way to put it, legally. Look. You've made amazing progress. Since this happened, Okay? But... But what? Listen. I just don't think...that this is the best environment for having Emily, right now. What happened to me David, has nothing to do with how well I can take care of our daughter. Amy? What is your gun doing in your nightstand? You..That... it should be locked up somewhere. I need that there for safety. You know that. That doesn't make you safe! Since you do judo classes and you kick boxing... It's ti quando. Whatever! Do you really think having a black belt makes you a better mother? I am a good mother! Do you think Emily cares about that? Yes, you used to be a good mother. And you can lie to your therapist and you can lie to yourself but I'm not gonna let you lie to that little girl. Because she does not need to pay for all this! GET OUT! Would you just listen to what I.... Listen..... I'll take her to school myself. Okay.. You know what? I'm not changing my mind. Okay. I'm sorry. And I'm not terying to punish you. But I am not changing my mind. Am I gonna live with him? What? That's what you guys are fighting about right? Your gonna live with dad? No we weren't fighting. We'll talk about it later. But your gonna be late for school. Emily...Wait. You know, no matter what happens, it's gonna be Okay. I know. What does that mean? It means I love you. Okay. Go on. He wants custody? That rat bastard. Three years ago we were talking about having another kid. But now were fighting over the one we have. I don't know how it comes to this? It always does. I don't care who the man is. If you give him a chance and he'll disappoint you. Hmm. Would you look at that? I swear you could set a table for four on that ass and still have room for the candles. He came the day before yesterday along with his friend in there, Mr. Borden. What. Is he a criminal? No one is talking. But they wont leave him alone for a second. Who ever he is, they want to keep him. Good morning ladies. Good morning. Gunshot wound. Came in bleeding all over the place. Looked like he got hit by a freight train. Why isn't he in ICU? No bets. I got two wards of flu patients plus dozens of walk ins that are looking for a vaccine we don't have. And they need a private room. Now look. Your gonna need a lawyer. This is the one that handled my last divorce. He's good. Call him. Tell him the situation. I don't... I...I think that we can still talk about it. You know. David's a good man. Amy NO! He's just worried. You need to take control of this thing. Before you loose Emily. Can you do that? I think so. Your gonna have to do better than that. Class! Gaurding stance! Right! Heyea! Front punches. Ready. One! Two! Three! I'm sorry Amy. No. I have some real reservations about testifying on your behalf in family court. And to be honest with you I.. I don't know what I can say that would help your case. I just want you to tell them that I'm okay now. Tell them that Emily should stay with me where she belongs. Five! Six! Change hands! Yeya! Front leg! Right kick. Ready! One! Two! Three! Okay. Well let's explore that. What exactly are Emily's needs? She needs a stable home environment. She's at a very pivital age in her emotional development right now and you still have these defensive barriers up. Yeah! Do you think that your really okay enough to provide her with that optimal environment? Yes. Of course. Really, so no more flashbacks, no more insomnia No more blackouts in the supermarket? No. Not every day. Telling you that's not exactly encouraging. In my opinion you still exhibit the behavour patterns of a victim. And that's understandable because you were the victim of a violent crime. ----Screaming---- But our goal is to help you get beyond that tramatic experience. And help you move toward your future... With emily. Unfortunately that can't happen until you take the steps towards letting go of the past. Now that's our time for today but we'll come back to this and next week we can look at some enpowerment statagies that will help you gain control of your life. Hi.

I'm just a nurse. Okay. Amy, I need to get out of here and I need to find somewhere safe. Okay. Okay? Okay. Not a sound. Okay. Why do they want you dead? I'm a journalist. I sniffed out some...discrepancies. Shipments of the vaccine into the state. Whole crates missing. Two trucks stole. They said there was a shortage. They lied. The shipments started dissappearing and suddenly the whole state went into lockdown. Ahh. I...I have to get out of here. The deeper I ah...dug the more it stank. The health commisoners office wouldn't even admit the day it was gone. And somewhere along the line... doctor manefests were being shuttled back to the CDC so it looked like they were running a surplus. Until people started panicking. Why would anyone go to all this trouble? It's just a flu vaccine? I don't know. Black market maybe. ah.. Terrorists. Pharmacudical companies. Are you alone? I...I...I'm alone but the man on the phone told me that somebody would be watching. And I don't.. Can you...get me out of this hospital, without whoever it is, seeing us? There's a staff exit.

Can you do that Amy? Yes. Oh, your bleeding. Ow. I'll patch myself up later. I got to get you to a doctor. No. No. No. You don't get it. I can't trust anyone. and you shouldn't either. Are you kidding me? Do you really want to do this? Where's my daughter? You want to know where she is? She's one phone call away from being dead. Know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna calll our mutual friend. I'm gonna let you hear your little girl. I'm gonna let you hear your little girl scream before I kill you. ........phone ringing......... If I don't receive a call by midnight tonight telling me the man is dead.... Your daughter will be found floating in the river with her throat slit. .....Distant conversation..... I don't have Emily. Okay. Why is that so hard to believe? I want to beleive you did. You want to beleive him don't you? Hmm Hmm. I do. Then why aren't you out there finding my daughter? So you filed papers in family court, trying to take sole custody of Emily, and the next day.. She diasappears. You don't find that interesting? That's a coincedence. I don't know. I don't have my daughter. Must be a tough road. So her father struggles in business, paying two mortgages on a home you can't even live in? And you think a judge is going to send you a daughter for Christmas. I'm not doing this for me. I'm doing this for her. Who Emily? What your trying to save her is that it? By any means? No. It...Amy is not well. Now if you'd been doing your job for ten minutes, you would haver figured that out. My.... wife...Is......My wife......is broken. It happened three years ago. She used to work alone then. A guy came out of nowhere. They never found him. They did a full rape kit... canvas.. But he was... gone. She's been in therapy ever since. ...Horn honks.... ...Horn honks.... I tried to help her..I...I bought her a gun, I went to the firing range. She took.. Every self defense class that she could think of. But it just ...tore us appart. She eventually told me to leave. Even with the medication she still has... nightmares, blackouts. She can't handle stress any more. Can't seem to function. What happened to her that night, she's never been the same. So if you can't find our daughter, if you can't help her, I don't know what Amy's gonna do. .........phone rings........ ...continues ringing... .....phone rings... Baldwin.

Yes it does...Yes it does. ...phone ringing.... Shit. ....phone rings.... Hello? David. David, I think I know where she is. Amy! Where are you. I've been trying to call.

If my instincts are right about this, Amy's in a whole mess of trouble right now. Her life and the life of her daughter are in danger. So I'm gonna ask you one last time and I want you to help me... No I want you to help your daughter. Where's Amy? She just called me, okay she said she knows where Emily is, that someone took her and she's on her way to get her back right now. You did the right thing. Tell me where I can find her. She said she's down by the river and I'm on my way right now. No. You stay clear. Hear me? Now give me the address. She said no police. Detective, she sounded really scared. You need to leave this to me. Let me do my job. Let me bring them both back, safe. Isn't that what you want? You have to understand this. It's the only way. Now where is she? She said she at Liesson and Leslies scrap and salvage. Tha...That there on an old ferry. Detective please. Don't let anything happen to them. Let me ask you something. Is there anything you wouldn't do to save your daughters life? No. Nothing. Would you kill for her? There's something else going on here. This isn't just a missing kid. Well you don't think Amy's mixed up in these murders do you? Oh, I'm sure of it. Sheree stopped her husband. Says she's down by the river side right now. Thinks she's been kidnapped. Should we call it in? No. Lets go check his story first. I think he's covering for her. ....Bucket rolling.... Emily? Emily? Emily? Emily? Turn around. Now! Who are you? He told me to come down here. Who? Nobody's heard from you all night. He expected you to call in. Since when? How the hell am I suppose to know. He just sent me down to find out what the hell you were doing. And he's pissed. Maybe there's something wrong with your phone. There's nothing wrong with my phone. So call him. I'm at the ferry. There's somebody here. Ow! Don't move Amy! What are you doing?
