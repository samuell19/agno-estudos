THE MINE WRITTEN BY PEKKO PESONEN DIRECTED BY ALEKSI SALMENPERÄ It seems that we're looking at an aggravated environmental crime. The maximum sentence is six years. Probation is only for sentences of less than two years. I recommend you tell the truth - because it'll look bad if you change your story later. Your sentence depends on the role you played in this. You can start from the beginning. What beginning? - From the very beginning. You have to ask Pekka Perä about that. I checked the ore bodies that Outokumpu is selling. I think I hit the jackpot. Does Talvivaara ring a bell? Outokumpu miscalculated their internal rate of return. According to them, it's about 14, but they miscalculated the cash flow. According to my calculations, it should be 25. If it's around 10, the company is useless. Damn, I spilled my beer. But if it's over 20, as in this case, - there's a chance to make big money. The metal prices have to soar. Outokumpu is making a mistake by giving up their mining operations. I know the ore body. I've built mines all around the world, - and I can say they're no more special than us. If they can do it, so can we. We want to cancel this purchase. On what grounds? You're trying to profit from our miscalculation. But what are the grounds for annulling - our preliminary contract? - C'mon. We're old buddies. You have grounds or not? The grounds are that you can't found the mine - if we don't sell you our bioleaching expertise. I can buy it elsewhere. There are only two companies in the world who master this process. Us and Pacific Ore, which we happened to acquire yesterday. So I suppose we both agree we should cancel this purchase. After that I got calls from a number of their executives - saying I can't hire Marja. I asked them, "What do you mean? I already did." They lost a million when they bought Pacific Ore. And the first person I hired was a 63-year-old woman. Can I smoke here? - No. When did you come into the picture? I'm sure you don't have to look like a banker. They're not going to hire a tree hugger. I need to look like a banker. Banker's shoes. A degree from Helsinki University of Technology with good grades. Damn. I guess you can still see well enough to read. ENVIRONMENTAL PERMIT AUTHORITY, OULU All right. But you don't have letters of reference. I have a few from practical training - where I worked with new techniques. At least the names of the courses are new. - That's right. Why the City of Oulu? With grades like that, - I doubt you're interested in becoming a civil servant. My wife is from here and we're expecting a baby. We have a support network here - and the houses are cheaper. - You're under her thumb, huh? Oh yeah. This is only a one-year fixed-term job. At least for now. Right. But I'm also interested in working in an official capacity. I think this would be a great opportunity to make contacts. The problem is that you don't have any contacts - and no one knows you here. It's a pretty big problem. There were more experienced applicants, - and I thought I'd never get the job. But they called the following week and asked me when I could start. You met Kalle at the interview. He's an environment counselor. He's a chemical engineer- and knows a thing or two about mineral processing. Welcome. - Hi. Good morning, Hannele. We have fresh new blood here. This is Jussi Karevuo. Hannele is our legal expert. She's a lawyer and also an environment counselor. - Hi. Here's the kitchen. You don't have to bring your own coffee. And here we have Eino. Uh-huh. Eino, can you come outside? This is Eino. - Jussi Karevuo. Eino is a limnologist. Jussi is our new environmental inspector. - Great. Can you come see me in my office at one? - Sure. One sharp. Here are the bathrooms. Here's your cell. Hi, Ulla. Hasn't anyone informed you? No. - Oh, shit. I'm sorry. HR makes the decisions, not me. I don't care. - Offices are given based on the departments. You need help? Was this room reserved for her? - No. People have their cliques here. Don't worry about it. What is Raimo like? He's a networker. He's got connections - in the industry, with politicians and other authorities. He's a man you want to be buddies with. Good morning. - Morning. How's the baby sleeping? - Well, but his mother isn't. What's keeping her up? - I wish I knew. Would she sleep better- if the baby's father had a permanent job? We got a permit application for something big. If you can handle it, you'll have at least one more year here. You sure you know how to do this sort of thing? I wouldn't be doing it by myself. It would be teamwork. I need you here at home also. Did your missus make the decision? - No. I don't think I have enough experience. You wouldn't be working alone. I'll form the best possible team to work on it. I'll also be part of it. The Kainuu office of Environment Institute monitored the YVA. YVA means environmental impact assessment. It's needed for the environmental permit. I don't know much about bioleaching. None of us here know even that. You're the only one who knows something - about these new techniques. The people in the Kainuu office also do, of course. We have six months to learn it. The process hasn't been tested properly, so no one knows... Could you close the door, please? The government will invest 50 million in the infrastructure only. We're safe. The scale of the project is insane... - Listen. We're all on the same side. There are plans for administrative reform. We'd become part of the regional state administrative agency, - under the Ministry of Finance. I believe - that I could get us one more post for an environmental counselor. It's a life-long post. The price of nickel won't stay this high for long. If you can't stay on the proposed schedule... The permits won't be a problem. Here's our last offer. Take your time. MEETING WITH FINANCIERS Unfortunately it's non-negotiable. We'd like to discuss it for a moment. The schedule is too tight. We should test... We'll fix the problems as we go. That's how we've always done it. - This is their last offer. What are our chances of succeeding with this schedule? It's impossible to say. This schedule is too tight, that's for sure. Wasn't this supposed to be just a formality? Sign it and then we'll go drink. To the first 7 million! Cheers. Here we go. It'll be a six-month project. Think about our future house. We have working hours, you know. I'm the only one who understands the technology. I'm sure you don't want me job hunting again in a year? His diaper needs to be changed. His diaper needs to be changed His diaper needs to be changed His diaper needs to be changed Did you accept bribes or benefits during the permit process? No. I just took a huge house loan from the bank. Where do you want this? - In the living room. Ahead and then right. A pretty grand house, huh? Did they offer anything besides a promotion? How's my son-in-law doing at work? Well... He knows the game. Put this on. I'm sure you've read the application, - so let's look at the requests for further information. I found 28 issues for which I'd request more information. Here are the printouts. Mostly they have to do with dust hazard, - water resource management, risk management - and emission measurements. Take your time. There's a Supreme Administrative Court precedent on dust hazards - from two years ago. I have it printed here. I think we should order expert statements from GTK and THL. GTK, the Geological Survey of Finland, gives expert statements - for environmental permits and impact assessments. They did the first bioleaching tests for the Talvivaara mine. I'm surprised that uranium isn't mentioned - in the environmental impact assessment, - even though there is uranium in Talvivaara. We're granting a permit to a nickel mine. There's undisputed evidence - that uranium isn't dissolved in the process - to the extent that it could be utilized, - so uranium shouldn't be brought up in this context. I suggest we grant an environmental permit - that's so ironclad no one can question it. I can get in touch with GTK regarding the uranium issue - and ask for the expert statement. - I can take care of it. I'm going there in any case. Thanks for the wedding invitation. My condolences. Does your wife also send hers? - I'm afraid so. You did a good job on the permit. - Thanks. We have to make sure we stay on schedule with other permits. This is taking up so much of our resources. You think you can do it? - Sure. I trust you. AUGUST 2007 As a minister and MP from this region, - laying the cornerstone of the mine is an important event for me. The project brings light into the lives of the local people. I believe that this project has long-term effects - on a number of different sectors... But the project wasn't accepted unanimously or without problems. Local people had their doubts and prejudices. They were mainly concerned about nature and water resources. During the permit process, several feedback sessions were held - with public authorities and private citizens. Our goal was open communication with all parties. As Minister of the Environment, - I'm happy that the environmental permits were granted - according to strict environmental criteria. People and nature come before economy. We'll be able to create a thousand jobs in the area. And another thousand jobs in the refining process. What do you say to people who worry about the lakes? We'll have a closed water loop. If we need to release any water, - it'll be cleaner than the water in the local lakes. That's what we thought. We'll look into the possibility of mining uranium. The concentration of uranium in the mineral aggregate is low, - but it will dissolve in the process. The amount of uranium in the area is rather high. But we'll discuss this further- in conjunction with our annual report. Thank you. Thank you, Olli-Pekka. Any questions regarding the Talvivaara mine? Here you are. I'm Jussi Karevuo from the Regional State Administrative Agency - of Northern Finland. So, uranium dissolves in the process? Our agency granted the permit because we were informed - that it won't dissolve significantly. The concentration of uranium is very low, - and we don't know if recovering it would be profitable. This is no news. We've known about the uranium reserve for a long time. Exploiting it commercially is, however, a different matter. Thank you. More questions? I just want to add that we're only looking - into the possibility of recovering uranium. - Right. Thank you, Olli-Pekka. Let's take a break. I'll get us liquids. Your sauna buddies keep secrets from you? You remember me? Ada? We studied together. You were three years ahead of me. Oh yeah. Maybe I do remember. I work at GTK. Oh. What about the sauna? So you really didn't know uranium is soluble? - Apparently not. We did the tests. Why didn't you mention it in your statement then? We informed your boss, Raimo. But my understanding is that he already knew about it. It's no surprise, since the reserve was discovered in the 70s. Yeah, but the concentration is very low. It's estimated to be 20,000 tons. It'll be Europe's largest uranium mine. A little firewater. It was nice seeing you. - Likewise. Take care. Did I interrupt something? No, I know her from school. - Okay. Okay, let's start networking. Uranium mine Väinö, please finish your meal. We have an early start tomorrow. Nuclear power plant -- uranium mine Protests against uranium mines Was the seminar good? How good? I still have work to do. Which one of you will read to me? Which one of you? - Mom will. I'll read to you. Give me the book and come here. "Profits from uranium mines go to multinational companies..." 2007 TALVIVAARA GYPSUM POND CONSTRUCTION What's the problem? - Getting macadam... What? - Getting macadam and stone dust into all those cracks. If it starts seeping, - those rocks might pierce the thin plastic cover. - It won't seep. We don't need a Mercedes; a Mitsubishi will do. - What? We don't need a Mercedes; a Mitsubishi will do! You don't need a lot of pressure for the rocks to pierce the plastic. But there's stone dust! - It can start seeping. You want to be blamed for the mine not opening on schedule? What? You want to make the call? Asshole speaking. Here's how it goes: If someone gives you 500 million euros, - you have to deliver. If you can't do that, it makes a bad story. No one wants to be part of a bad story. The state should sell its shares - to create new national heritages like the Talvivaara mine. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY 2012 Why is Ulla here, even though she's an environmental counselor? She runs her own one-woman department. Too many opinions? I'd say the reason is different world views. Ulla is a biologist. She and I are the only ones left who aren't engineers or lawyers. It's no use digging into the past. It won't change things. I'll just check a couple of things. Ada Koljonen speaking. Hi, it's Jussi Karevuo. We met at the seminar. Just a moment. All right. - Err... What did you mean when you said that a number of things - should've been mentioned in the environmental impact assessment? I have all the documents here. What do you need the information for? - I just want to know. This is confidential, of course. It's not that easy for everyone to find a job in this field - and become a member of a hunting fraternity. - Well... I have a house loan of 350,000 euros, - so I don't want trouble, either. And I haven't shot any animals. Why do you have to go to Kuopio? I'm meeting someone from GTK. - On a Saturday? Why does GTK want to hide it? Aren't you responsible for the accuracy of the statements? Part of our budget comes from the state. They want us to help industry and create jobs. But we have to get a large part of the funding ourselves. From companies? We sell consulting services to companies. Our budget depends on them. - So? When we're asked to give expert statements about their projects, - of course it has an impact on what kind statements we write. GTK is more a lobbying organization than a reference center. The same goes for the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority. Aren't you exaggerating? This is a paper written by our researchers - on the black schist in Talvivaara. This was given to Pekka Perä - and Olli Salo from the LVT environmental consultant company. This paper says that the piles of black schist must be covered, - or it would be impossible to control the polluted water. I guess the researcher wasn't aware of the scale of all this. This paper wasn't mentioned in the environmental impact assessment. It wasn't in the statement you ordered from us, either. I can't remember that. It's impossible to build a closed water loop in Finland. One bioleaching pile area is 120 hectares, - and there are several of them. How the hell do you cover that big an area? A hectare is 100 meters by 100 meters. You know Ekdahl from GTK? I don't know him personally, but I do know who he is. What kind of a man is he? - A mining engineer. He used to work for Industry Investment Ltd. He was responsible - for promoting risk financing in the mining industry. Why do you ask? - I'm just trying to get the full picture. I was at his inauguration. Minister of Trade and Industry Mauri Pekkarinen gave a speech. There's potential in the mining business - especially in eastern and northern Finland - where new jobs are needed the most. There people also understand the importance of the industry. GTK operates in a field that has its own restrictions, - such as nature conservation programs. The Natura 2000 network of protected areas was just expanded. I won't complain about the decisions, - but I hope that in the future - economic and social aspects will be taken more into account - when decisions regarding nature conservations are made. Ekdahl definitely understands the economic aspects. Damn, onions give me heartburn. HELSINKI STOCK EXCHANGE Ekdahl, your boss, has 7,500 stocks in the mine. Not a whole lot but nevertheless. I'm not surprised. Another interesting stockholder is Olli Salo. His company, LVT, made the environmental impact assessment. Yeah, I remember. The mine ordered the assessment - from one of its biggest stockholders. Salo is the sixth biggest owner. Okay. Then there's Minister Lehtomäki. People and nature come before economy... She doesn't own stocks, but her husband, mother and children - have stocks worth 300,000 euros. They're amateurs. Real players who want to hide their ownership - buy their shares through a foreign bank. The database would only show the name of the administrator- who registered the purchase. - Oh, you can do that? In Finland you can. So, we wouldn't know if my boss was also an owner? No. Hi, it's Pekka. Have you recovered from the mining engineering convention? Yeah, we're getting too old to party for days on end. I'm calling you because I know - why you got the concentration readings of certain metals - in Lake Kivijärvi and Lake Laakajärvi. Well, we have a small leak in a pipe. Yeah, we'll fix it. But we shouldn't jump to conclusions about these two things. We're gonna be listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. Pekka, want to smell this? Sure. But you don't have to publicize the readings yet, do you? I'm glad you could all come on such short notice. The problem is that the evaporation of water in the process - isn't as high as was estimated. We need to get rid of the water. Yesterday we pumped water from the primary field and it leaked. The overflow ponds are full, - and we won't get a permit to drain more water. We'll get a higher drainage quota in the follow-up permit later. We should've tested the effects of weather... That's easy to say in hindsight. We have to decide what to do with the water and fix the process. There are also other things... The only solution I see is to release water into the gypsum pond. They're not designed for that. And we don't have a permit. - We read the permits last night. They can be interpreted in such a way - that allows us to release water into the ponds. I can't approve of that. - Where will you release it then? It's a judgment call. We just have to choose the least risky option. Let's halt the mining and fix the process. That's not financially possible. So it's decided. I want it to be written in the minutes - that it's a risk and we don't have a permit. I also want it to be written - that management has been informed of the risk. If anyone asks, our official statement is - that all the water problems are caused by heavy rainfall. ...estimated the amount of sulfates to be 170 milligrams per liter. Now it's applying for a permit for 7,000 milligrams per liter. That's 41 times the initial concentration. Talvivaara requested a review of the permit regulations. It has to do with increased production and waste water quotas. The initial estimates were a little low. They're also applying for a permit for a uranium recovery plant. I'm sure you've read about it in the papers. They need the permit fast, as they're already building the plant. I suggest Kalle be the referendary. - Aye, captain. Hannele, Jarkko, Jussi and I will grant the permit. Except I don't want to work on the uranium dump. - Okay. Jussi could be the chairman of the team, - since he knows the case best. I would appreciate it if this time - you kept me informed about all matters regarding the permit. What do you mean? - I mean the uranium. It wasn't relevant when they applied for the initial permit, - as they didn't know if it could be exploited. There's at least 20,000 tons of uranium. People at GTK knew it's soluble. What do you mean? The testing was done at GTK. The constitution says - that the government has to protect citizens' right - to influence decisions regarding their environment. We didn't do that. We intentionally covered up the uranium findings. Now the basis on founding a uranium mine is - that uranium is soluble anyway- and that it's better for the environment to recover it. We're married to it, so we can't pull out. Jokes aside, this is a good topic. We'll discuss it in teams. We should do that, since they're already building the uranium plant. Well, the government has given its blessing. We're all on the same side. I think the most important thing is that we look ahead - and make the best possible decisions in this situation. Right? So do we accept the make-up of the permit team? Yeah. - Accepted. Were you threatened or pressured during the permit process? Jussi, why don't you come with me. All right, chop-chop. A little wacky tobacky. We'll take it easy. We're in deep shit with the follow-up permit. I don't understand how they managed to fuck up - their emissions quota calculations so bad. - No kidding. Have you thought about the new emissions limits? I guess we'll just have to find the best possible compromise. I'll do my best. I trust you. Have some more. The first permit process went so well. You know anyone at GTK? No. I'm asking because we need to talk with them about the uranium. You can have the rest. I also want to know if we got all the necessary information. Or if there was a mistake. But you don't know anyone, huh? I don't. Ilkka sent me a text message - saying they need one more beater over there. 800 meters from here. I'll be all right. I only need one gun. - Oh, sorry. Did you tell Raimo you talked to someone from GTK? - No. Why? Ekdahl threw a fit. I just said that the tests were done by you.-You sure? Yeah. - Does anyone know we've met? No. Haataja's commitment and hard work on the ice... Raimo! I'll see you later. Yeah? I got the invitation to the pre-employment checkup. - Yes? You know what kind of tests they'll run? Oh, that's right. They'll send the results to me. Don't worry about them. Tonight's a hockey night. - Yeah. Right? Yeah? - Who handles the Talvivaara notices? You or Raimo? What notices? Hi, it's Jussi Karevuo - from the northern Finland administrative agency. I'm calling about your notice regarding the dust hazards and odor. There's no way for us to be able to assess - if your measurements are more accurate than the ELY Center's. Let me finish, please. I'm calling about the notice you sent... You've also measured... I'm listening. How can you be so angry? We also have... I'm not saying that... We can't control the ELY Centers... Fuck! Companies are almost solely responsible - for monitoring their emissions. Talvivaara hired a company to do mandatory monitoring for them. The ELY Centers take a couple of tests a year at the most. I'll draw my last chart. ELY Center stands for- Center for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment. It monitors the environmental impact assessments. It also monitors the operations of the mine. The pH of the water in our treatment plant - has to be between 6 and 10. Now... Shit! The pH is 9.5 at the moment, so we're doing great. How often does the ELY Center take tests here? Once or twice a year. So everything depends on mandatory monitoring? We have 200 other sites that we monitor. Talvivaara does its own testing. - You mean Ramboll does? Well, yeah. We have one hell of a PR problem. Yesterday the news said some special needs kids got a rash - at a camp in 2009 and 2010 when they swam in Lake Kivijärvi. I heard. - We have to deny it right away. That's why you invited us here? I hope we can share a PR strategy and not cause any panic. Journalists will call you too. You've been releasing emissions into Lake Kivijärvi all along. Your nickel emissions were 7 times higher than the EU quality norms. Closer to the mine, they were 130 times higher. Skin problems can be anything. Maybe there's algae in the lake. Or mold or bedbugs at the camp center. We're in the process of applying for a follow-up permit. We'll probably need another round of financing. You have to promote the industry. Fuck. If I had known... In a couple of years, you can go back to GTK. The rest of us are in deep shit. You don't have to lie. Just don't say anything. Pääkkönen was in charge of our office - when they did the bioleaching tests. He's at the ELY Center on a temp contract. Minister Lehtomäki appointed him. People were surprised because - he doesn't have any experience as an environmental officer. Now he's in charge of monitoring the mine. Lead by Kari Pääkkönen, - GTK's Kuopio office has become a key player- in developing the mining industry in five provinces. I can wholeheartedly say to the people of Kainuu - that you chose a good man. I checked the ELY Center's rules of procedure. Pääkkönen is in charge of the environmental impact assessments, - amendments to permits and coercions such as penalty payments - or halting mining until emissions are under control. The mine hasn't got a single penalty payment. Last week MTV3 News said that special needs children - got skin problems after swimming in Lake Kivijärvi. Everyone at our company got very worried - about our company possibly causing problems for special needs kids. But it can't possibly be true. When these children got skin problems, - the concentrations in Lake Kivijärvi weren't above the limit. There isn't even a theoretical possibility - that our company was to blame. MTV3 News didn't check this, - so that's why we have to defend ourselves now. But the concentrations are above the limit now. Slightly above the limit, but nothing out of the ordinary. Is he lying? Yeah. Oh honey. The ELY Center didn't correct Perä's claims. The Institute for Health and Welfare backed them up. People won't be exposed to these substances, - unless they drink water from the lakes or rivers. I did the test yesterday. Sorry. What? I'm pregnant. Yay! We did it! What's the goal of our secret society? I don't know. I have to go. The Russians answered. And? They're willing to pay twice as much as I thought. This is the best exit plan there will ever be. How would it look if we sold now? How do you think the company looks now? We'll make it work. - We've run out of money. In five years we'll sell this for ten times more. Have you heard the story - about a tree hugger girl who climbed a tree to stop logging? She gets tired, - slides down the tree and gets a splinter in her pussy. She's crying when she's taken to the health clinic. The doctor examines her and says, - "This is serious, but I have to take care of something else first." The girl waits and waits. She's lying on the examination table in pain. Finally the doctor comes back and removes the splinter. The girl asks him what took so long. The doctor says, "As an environmental activist, - you should know that you need a permit - for removing a piece of rotten wood from a recreational site." A toast to the shooter. - Let's drink. I remember what it was like when my kids were little. It was tough. - Yeah, it is. Listen. I just talked with Markku. The Suhanko gold mine is looking for an environmental director. I could arrange a leave for you - and recommend you. You could come back after the dust settles. You'd get experience in the field and a six-figure salary. It's not about the money. Is the uranium thing still bothering you? We have to be careful because people get hysterical- when they just hear the word. Can we speak frankly? - Sure. Our problem is that we see companies as our clients. We don't want to make them angry because it would be unpleasant. But if we think about it, local people are our customers. If we betray them, we have no one. The locals also want the industry to do well and give them jobs. In this system we're the only authority that can protect nature. Talvivaara has run out of money. Our job is to get them a good follow-up permit. Otherwise the whole thing can come down, - or there will be a major accident. We can't base our decisions on a company's profit calculations. I don't think you understand the situation. I think I'm just starting to understand it. Jussi. You also have a splinter in your pussy? Huh? You sound like my 15-year-old daughter. The police have already received dozens of complaints about us. If there are going to be charges, - you're responsible for the first permit - and for the water management issues. How do you think our e-mail exchange would look - if a third party read them? I hope you'll act like a grown man. We also have good news. The local paper publicized - the Local Person of the Year poll results. You came in second. Who won? Some 20-year-old girl who writes a lifestyle blog. Never heard. We've been thinking... I looked at our recent numbers. Fucking shit! This isn't fucking working! Fuck! What the fuck are you waiting for? The only fact is that we need more money. To get that, we need a new story. A better story. The name of the story is Operation Overlord. The goal of Operation Overlord is to double our annual production - to 100,000 tons. We'll create a new project team. I want experts in metallurgy, infrastructure, bioleaching, - material handling and project management. Isn't that a bit far from reality? Our annual production has been 16,000 tons at best. For fuck's sake! We have the most expensive instruments in the world! We just have to know how to play them! Work harder, dammit! I can start letting people go. I don't have to care about rules. I can pay. Operation Overlord. Fucking hell! Nonalcoholic. What are we celebrating? Onni falling asleep, for example. I've started dreaming about living abroad. It would be possible while the kids are still small. What are you talking about? It's possible that I'll have to make decisions - that would make it hard for me to find work here. Why can't you think of your job as just a job? I thought you also wanted this. Yeah. The job wasn't what I expected it to be. You don't have to like it. You just have to tolerate it. How many days have you worked a job you don't like? Or worked at all? I didn't mean... ...that you should've... Why don't we start. - Väinö isn't here yet. Väinö, come here! How are things at work? The same. We've been pretty busy. I've heard about other things going on. You wouldn't be there if I hadn't given my okay. How are things at home? Eeva seems quiet. Give it to me. Get your priorities in order. I've been thinking about our conversation. You were right. We should all just take care of our own responsibilities. I should probably check my attitude. - Okay. I mean, I definitely should. Is the environmental counselor post still possible? Can you send me a proposal for the new emissions limits? We need to finally take a stance on it. What kind of a proposal? A reasonable one. Of course. Send it to me today. Sure. Hi Raimo, The reasonable? proposal is attached. Jussi Karevuo was appointed environmental counselor today. What? How big? Fuck. Fucking shit. The Talvivaara metal factory halted production - due to a leak in a gypsum pond. Untreated waste water full of metals and sulfates - is leaking from the pond. The local ELY Center estimated - that the leak amounts to hundreds of thousands of cubic meters. The cause is still unknown. The same pond also leaked two years ago and in 2008. The banks were raised due to record-heavy rainfall this summer. The worst-case scenario is leakage into lakes and rivers. Phones must be ringing at the ELY Center. I don't envy them. If anybody asks, the ELY Center is monitoring - and the police are investigating the case. We're safe and fine. Safe and fine. All right. What's this week's procedure? Wait. Let's have coffee and buns first. ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER IN TALVIVAARA WHO'S RESPONSIBLE? HOW THE MISTAKE WAS MADE TALVIVAARA POLLUTING THE RIVER A TOTAL FAILURE Jussi, have a bun. JYRKI KATAINEN PRIME MINISTER JAN VAPAAVUORI MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS It's clear we've made mistakes. They've caused emotional damage. We'll learn more about the environmental damage later. As the former chairman of the board, - I can only apologize for the damage we've done. For the emotional damage. And possible environmental damage. I don't know if anybody believes me, - but Talvivaara has more emotional than financial value to me, - even though the stocks have great financial value. To quote politician Paavo Väyrynen, - "Can you die from being pissed off?" REPUTATION MANAGEMENT COMPANY TEKIR It was good, - except that twice you questioned causing environmental damage. What do you mean? We can watch it again. - Nah, we don't have to. I'll repeat it once more: now you should just apologize. I can't apologize all the time. It would be the smartest thing to do at this point. People are angry. Then you have to find arguments - for reopening the mine as soon as possible. I'm sure that at this point the smartest thing is to apologize. Money is a minor thing here. We're worried about the environment - if we don't get a chance to clean the site before spring. What does it mean in practice? We should restart the metal factory- so that we can start the cleaning process. The good thing is - that environmental issues and finances go hand in hand. What if you're unable to restart the factory? What'll happen? That's the worst-case scenario for the environment and employees. At the moment we're storing large quantities of water. The situation will be risky if we get heavy rainfall again. What are you going to do, environmental counselor? What do you mean? The follow-up permit. There's not much I can do by myself. So, you won't do anything? There's not much I can do. Right. Well, congratulations on the appointment then. The whole mining industry will be seen in a bad light. The situation is critical. I'm very sorry - that this company, partly owned by the state, - is ruining the image of the mining industry. I came up with a wild idea over the weekend. People who have cabins at the lake - say they can't use the water in their saunas. How about we order Talvivaara to provide them with clean water? That's a great idea. Seriously. Finns like that kind of stuff. I'm interested in the 1.3 million cubic meters of waste water- that Talvivaara wants to release into lakes and rivers annually. If it has 170 milligrams of sulfates per liter, - it's the same as dumping a truckload of sulfate - every other day into Lake Laakajärvi. And another truckload into Lake Jormasjärvi. Sulfates really aren't poisonous. They are, if you look at fish and benthos... Why do you go on about the sulfate emissions of one mine - when the forest industry's emissions are a lot higher? Pass me the coffee, please. All right. That's right. We'll discuss these further in smaller groups. The first thing we need to discuss today is the new intranet. Wow. I brought these - in case we got lucky and you died. No fucking way. Just arrhythmia. Well? A little setback with the uranium. According to the Nuclear Energy Act, - the permit for uranium recovery can be taken from us - if we run into financing problems. You might want to suspend the building of the plant. - No. It would be a bad signal. Getting money after that would be hard. It's going to be hard in any case. The pension insurance companies are losing faith in us. We'll appeal to small stockholders. They want to make money. We should get the state involved. Small stockholders believe what the state says. We need the minister from the Green Party and her authority. We'll explain to the minister that we can't stop the process. The state will have to clean up the site in any case. - Is that so? That's the kind of arguments they're looking for. The state has invested so much money that they can't pull out. They'd look like a bunch of idiots. What do you suggest? That we file for bankruptcy. It would make a bad story. We now need - to find a new environmental director as soon as possible. The best possible one. We thought about possible candidates, - and your name popped up. This might sound like an odd idea at first, - but if you think about it, it would be a logical one. I'm sure you know - the salary would be a lot higher than in a government job. You know our problems - and our crucial needs when it comes to the environment. I've heard you're a pedantic guy who cares about the environment. We've made huge mistakes in environmental matters. On the other hand, we can fix the mistakes. We'd like to give you a chance to make a difference. On a concrete level. You wouldn't be pushing papers. We don't have to buy off officials if that's what you're thinking. Which is nicer? I don't care. Would this look better with the pants? I don't fucking care. - I don't either. I guess you think your decisions are for our best. You clearly make them on your own. You're still going on about the jackets? You have a one-man old boy network. - I see. And a one-man misery club. Please stop. - I want to stop. I'm not married to the house, kids, this car or this city. I'm married to you. You get it? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have even come. I think we started off on the wrong foot. I could explain - what measures we've been planning to take... That went well. I'm sure you know what to do. Good morning. You have time to take a look at the hydrogen sulfide emissions? I don't have time. Sorry. - Okay. I'm exhausted. What a mess. If I didn't have a family, I would've accepted - the environmental director job at the Suhanko gold mine. Eeva doesn't want to move. So, they're looking for someone? - Yeah. The salary is pretty good. - Well, that's just... Maybe I'll be able to convince Eeva to move. All right then. I guess I'll have to do these on my own. I can take a look. We can discuss these later. Hey, thanks. Kalle is taking a one-year leave. He'll be the environmental director of the Suhanko gold mine. He deserves it. - Thanks. And sorry. We have to decide if we can handle the follow-up permit - or if we need to look for someone to replace Kalle. I think it would be good to have someone. The amount of work is huge. - Yeah. Especially if we're busy. - That's right. We need someone who understands water management. With all due respect, Eino. - Yeah. We don't have the money to hire anyone. How about Ulla? She's a hydrobiologist, right? Ulla? She's not exactly a team player. - That's right. She can't rock this boat, - since the rest of us agree on things. Ulla is undoubtedly competent. But it's possible she isn't even interested in teamwork. Why don't we ask her? - Sure, why not. Were you at the game on Saturday? Or did you watch it on TV? Oh yeah... We've looked further into the impact of emissions. Here's our proposal for the new emissions limits - for the follow-up permit. I just sent them to you all by e-mail. We can't grant permission for the higher sulfate limit. The limit must be close to the limit in the original permit. An annual quota for sulfate and different metals - must also be determined. When it comes to the gypsum ponds, - the water must be treated or recycled by the end of October. We also require a more detailed water management plan - for emergency situations. We also see - that the permit for uranium recovery can't be granted - before we receive a report- on whether officials were intentionally misinformed - when uranium wasn't mentioned in the first permit. That's it. Who are "we"? I see. May I ask what the new limits are based on? On our assessment as to what causes considerable harm to the environment. Playing behind other people's backs like this is inappropriate. Isn't it? You can gather your personal belongings. You've been dismissed. - Based on what? Drug testing. You're not fit for a managerial position. Bye. Just for your information, - I'm going over this permit process with the police. - I see. I have the guts to discuss the drug tests with them. Do you? Did you run into problems - because you got into this too fast and the project was too big? Founding a small mine and seeing how it goes isn't an option. It won't be profitable. You have to hit big. Or do nothing at all. If you're afraid, you don't have to do anything. The problem is - that orders and requests are never sent by e-mail. They're given face to face or on the phone. No one can prove someone tried to affect the permit process. No one makes decisions; they're just made. The negative publicity has had an effect. The permit process takes very long. The authorities take their time - and want to be more thorough than before. In some way it feels that people have stopped using common sense. Minister Niinistö thinks he can close down our mine, - but he can't. That's bullshit. But in the long run, what politicians do has an impact. They use their power when they appoint people. Ministries give procedures to the ELY Centers. Politicians mainly do what people want. This is what people wanted. Two small lakes and their benthos were more important - than 2000 jobs. There are about 56,000 lakes in Finland. We're confused about what you've told us. We haven't noticed any elements of a crime. This isn't corruption, since no one was bribed. But haven't people used their public position - for the benefit of themselves or their friends and family? We're just investigating - if a crime was committed according to Finnish law.
