(film reel spins) (cartoon music) - [Kore] You know, I remember actually, it was actually my mother told me, when she used to go to a film club when she was really little, she said that the ultimate goal was to see the projectionist and you know that it's like light housekeepers when they had them. There might be somebody in there and you might see them. It's like that unknown, isn't it? It's not knowing if it's really there or not. And that's what I love about it. Just a magical job. It really is. - Went with my mum, and we used to go every week to the local cinema, which mine was the Trocadero or the ABC, opposite, or every now and again, we went to the Granada Kennington. And I just fell in love with movies. I wanted to get into the movies. - We used to go to the cinema a lot. And I used to look, well, I was more interested in the building itself than actually the film. Get bored with the film and look around. And the old, old thing, you'd see the beam coming from the back of the cinema and wonder how everything worked. And that's what sparked my interest in cinema. - I bought a packet of chewing gum and behind the chewing gum was four or six frames of 35 millimetre film. They were cutouts from features. I had a bicycle at the time and I took the front torch off and put the frame against the torch and showed it onto the tiles of the fireplace. It gave a picture, but of course, without a lens in front, it was blurry. And that's how it all started. - My mother was a projectionist. Basically, she bought me up on her own and when she couldn't get anybody to look after me, she had to take me to work. So, she did say, even as a baby, she'd have me in the projection room. Well, I can remember, I dunno how old I was, but she sat me on a stool in front of the rewind bench. I had all of my toys out on the rewind bench and she goes, you just sit there and you don't touch anything. Don't push anything. Don't touch anything. You imagine what that's like to a child. It's like. ooh, (laughs). - Basically, ever since I can remember, I used to go to work with my dad on weekends, school holidays and running around a projection room and various empty rooms of a cinema and just, I suppose, the bug bit me. And I was always up for coming back and playing with bits of film and looking at the little tiny men in the frame. (laughs) Yeah, so that was basically it. I suppose it was in the blood. - When I left school, I worked in a radio shop and I was going to be a trainee engineer, and I had to go to night school three nights a week. And on Wednesday afternoon we had half day closing and we used to go to the cinema. And a slide came up on the screen advertising for a probationary projectionist. And I had a little think about it and I thought, well, I wouldn't mind doing that. - I went to the Kinema Kingston, which used to show third week releases. And I got a job there as a rewind boy, only on Saturday afternoons. And then it sort of developed from there. I was too young to be a projie at that time. I was still at school. But they said, when you leave school, we'll give you a job as a projectionist. The funny thing about it was the laws were so strict then I had to get a letter from my dad to say that I could watch H films and X films. That that was the category. They were horror films and sort of spicy French films they used to show there. And as a kid, I loved that, but I was told not to look out the porthole. - I applied to my local cinema just before I left school to get a job and started with them as a rewind boy, which in them days you did everything. You looked after the boilers, changed the metal lettering in the canopy to advertise the forthcoming film. - There was a job advertised for an usher at the Scala Cinema And I ran down and got the job as the usher and I'd creep up the stairs and then go up and spend the time in a projection booth. It wasn't a booth area. It was like a palace that the projection box. I very quickly volunteered my services to rewind films as the films came off the projector and I'd be found in the projection box instead of in the auditorium. And that's how I kind of started projecting. - Yes, I had to go over to the State Kilburn where there was a guy called Ken Gambles He was like head of the Relief Chief. And he gave me two options. There was the Elephant & Castle, which is the brand new one. And I went for an interview there, but I think the guys there didn't really want me there 'cause they were earning overtime so they didn't want a third person. So, I then got sent to Streatham Odeon where I met the Chief there, who was a little fellow called Freddy Good. Always smoking a cigar. And he just gave me the job. - It's very, sort of, military based if you know what I mean? You had the trainee, the third, the second, the co-second, and then the senior second and the Chief. And it was like a pecking order type thing. - But in the old days you'd start off possibly as a rewind boy, which is equivalent to tea boy. And he'd do as told. And then he'd maybe become a third projectionist. And the third projectionist, he'd be in charge of the rewind boy. (laughs) (film reel spins) - [Ron] It was customary in the '30s and '40s and '50s for people, for trainees to have served a three year apprenticeship. When I was a trainee, I wasn't allowed to touch a projector. All I was allowed to do is sweep up, polish floors and that's all, and rewind the films. - I started in 1962 at the Granada, as I say, in Sutton, but because it was such a large box crew, nothing happened very quickly. It was almost three to four months before I even touched a film or a projector. I remember the very first day, my first job was to sweep out the boiler house and paint the floor. - Well, obviously, after a time, I became very inquisitive. I wanted to be able to do more things apart from just rewinding, making tea and changing gas mantles. So, the Chief slowly taught me how to, first of all, he showed me how a projector worked and what it did. Then he showed me how to lace up the projector, which took quite a bit of time. But eventually I found the knack of that 'cause you go to the top loop, button loop and sound heads and so on and so forth. - If you were taught properly how to handle film then you are capable of making joins in the film and checking it. Making prints up, making sure they were okay and not damaged. So, basically, probably, that's what the thirds did So, the second sort of got them to do those sort of things. - Well, in my case, I worked for the Chief on a Saturday morning doing the kids shows and I could sort of, they weren't too worried if you made a mess of that. - I remember once that I was a trainee and it was for kids show, the CFF kids show. And I was expecting the Chief Projectionist to come and work with me. He was supposed to, you know? And he didn't turn up. And I remember going down to the manager saying, well, Steve's not here. And she goes, oh, you'll be able to put it on, won't you? I go, no. She goes, no, just do your best. And I got upstairs and I actually got, yeah, I got into the feature. I actually got through the whole programme. I was sweating like anything. And when Steve walked through the door, it was like, I could have thrown myself at his feet and he said his alarm clock hadn't gone off. - And the kids in the cinema, you know, they were terrible, some of them. One of the usherettes came up to me and she said, would you go into the toilet? She said, there's a fire started into the gents toilet. So, I went in there and there was three boys, about 11 and 12 and what they'd done, they rolled all this toilet paper out, put it in the pile and set it alight (laughs) dancing round it. - I got promoted to fourth projectionist, to third projectionist. And during that time I used to help out over at the Odeon across the road. I started with, with Odeon or Rank in 1960. And I stayed with them for 47 years. - There was a lot of sort of hierarchies in cinema management. There was the Manager, the Assistant Manager, the General Manager, the Regional Manager and so on and so forth. And they were always trying to run the theatres as cheaply as possible, obviously. - But Odeon were very, very unionised. And actually, it meant that they kept us, sort of, at a payment level that we could afford to live on, just, in London. (film reel spins) (machine buzzes) (handle bangs) - Everyone knows when you do something wrong, but when you do something well, they don't notice you. And the projectionist is kind of like that. You know, there was the very famous quote that's used in the training manuals about the fact that the projectionist is the last person in the film production process, you know. They spend tens of millions of pounds on a film, but if the projectionist gets it wrong, it's a waste of time. - In those days, the films, of course, would arrive five, six reels in cans in a big transit case. A heavy metal transit case. - [Ali] And there were literally a hundred steps to climb up and the cans were heavy metal cans. And that's hard work. But it was fun. But it was hard work. - [Barrie] So, you take it out the case, put it on the plate on the rewind bench with a 2000 foot spool on the other one and carefully wind it through, checking it every so often. Check every splice for a bad splice, pull it apart using cement, make another, remake the join. Checking for scratches, V cuts, et cetera, et cetera. Checking for your cue dots and make up the film that way. But of course it was the feature to make up plus the trailers, plus the adverts, plus news reel, and sometimes a short or cartoon. - In the original cinemas you used to have whole compliments of projectionist because it was reel to reel. So, you'd have two projectors. You'd have one reel on each projector and they'd be looking for the changeovers to move from one projector over to the other to keep the continuity. And that's the skill in itself. - Here, in fact, we put them on 2000 foot spools and we do changeovers between two projectors. So, every 20 minutes you change over to the next reel on the next projector. And then after another 20 minutes, you change over back to machine one and like that. Okay, you see the cue dots here. They're nice, clear. They're standard cue dots. They're printed on. And they're over on the top right of the frame. And they are on four, look, four consecutive frames and they go. And that's the end of them. So, you get a sixth of a second to see that they're on screen. A sixth of a second with four consecutive frames. And those are the, that's the first set of cue dots, the motor cue as we call it, and then 11 feet for further, there are the over cue, which is exactly the same, but 24 frames from the end of the film. - Yeah, and you couldn't get things wrong. You couldn't strike up the projector too soon or too late. You couldn't set the projector running too late. You had to be able to judge precisely when and turn it on and then, and open it up and turn it, change it over. And often you'd change over and you'd be trying to rack up the film so it was in the right place and then focus it. And then I, and then at Scala would have to run down to the auditorium to check the sound, as well. 'Cause we couldn't hear the sound in the booth. So, you'd then run back up and you'd be, as you were in the auditorium, oh that's too, it's too quite. Oh, it's too loud. And run back up and then you'd have to run back down to check, as well. And then you'd be in there thinking, no that's not quite in focus and run back upstairs again. So, it was, you had to be quite athletic there. - Now, this is controversial. I hate "The Sound of Music". I was cheering for the Germans at the end. In those days we, single reels, which a film only lasted 20 minutes. But they didn't. They only lasted 12 minutes because they were edited to fit the song. So, they'd sing, change over. Next reel sing another song. And it was like that for about 11 reels. You just got time to lace up the next one, rewind the old one, put that back. And then that one be finishing. And you'd be going, you'd be like that. And you did that from 11 o'clock in the morning until 11 o'clock at night. You wanted to blow your brains out. And you know, I thought, oh God, I know songs. And oh dear. I thought I hate this film. (film reel spins) - This new chief took over. And he said to me, you've been here two and a half years. He said, do you think you can do a changeover? So, I sat on this stool and watching the film and I got just carried away with it. And I suddenly realised, and I opened the spool box and there was about three minutes film left and I hadn't even laced up the other machine. And I ran round there. I ran round there and I went to lace it up. I got halfway through the lacing and suddenly I heard, bloo bloop. And showed a white sheet. And he came up and he actually lost his temper. He said, you'll never make a projectionist as long as you'd live. - It's a job that just flies by because you are so busy keeping everything going. And then there's periods where, you know, it's fairly quiet, as well. Once the films are on, there's that lull where you can sit down, you can relax. But there is a degree, you know, of showmanship. You want to put on the best show you can, which is why, you know, a true projectionist would always want to work in a cinema that's got curtains. So you can do the curtains. You can set the tabs or, you know, the lighting, everything. So, it's just slick and smooth and beautiful. And you are projecting the best image possible. And the sound is the best it possibly can be. You've got everything at the right level. So, you know, that was very much part of the job. - You use to put music on, on the non sync, 'cause it was like it'd be a record. And then you went over to tapes and you'd have it on. And you'd have it on and you use to time the track to finish just as you boom, (hands clap) start the programme. And so, the curtains would open as the track finished. And then you'd put your house lights down first. And when they were halfway down, then your pageant lights, which are the ones that like the tabs, which is the curtains and then you'd open them up. And then the film would hit the screen, you know. - But there was a scene in "The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms". That was it. Where you see the beast come out of the sea. This is the first time you see it and there's a lighthouse and it grabs hold the lighthouse but as the beast rises, right, you get this punchy Warner Brothers music, you know, going, dang, dang, dang. You know, really powerful music, you know? And I used to turn it up like at one point or something like that. And the audience, you know, you could see them, their heads down in the bottom, watching the film and they just go, ah. (film reel spins) - [Greg] Carbon arcs were two pieces of carbon. You had a negative and you had a positive. All that happens, you strike 'em together And there's a current going through 'em and it gives you a little flame. And then you got a big mirror and it concentrates that flame on the gate where the film's going through. And they were motor driven. And in an ideal world, they should run at the speed of the burning. But it could go the other way. They could overrun, which meant they touched. And if they touched the light would go like that or they would under-run and you burn and burn and burn. And when the gap got too wide, they went out. - And these carbons had copper wrapped around them. And as they burnt away, there was little drips of copper goin' into a tray. And we used to save them every day and, 'cause copper was quite expensive at that time. You got a lot of money for it. That was the Chief's perk. - A carbon arc won't last the whole programme. It lasts just over an hour, if you're lucky. In the early days, when I first worked there, you had to rush to the toilet and rush back just in case your carbon arc had gone funny. But then Xenons came in, which is a lamp. It's the same principle. It's an arc, but it's enclosed in a glass bulb. So, it's constant light. You don't have to worry about it. I mean the only thing that they did do, every now and again, was blow up. - [Steve] All films before 1953 were based, were done on Nitrate stock. Brighton Rock, which I know is only black and white film, but it was an original release print from 1947 or '48. And it was stunningly good. It's like what you see high definition TV now. And you can actually see the perspiration on the actor and you could see the makeup and everything. - Because in the early days they were flammable films. So, you couldn't keep them near the projector. And of course, the old machines had to have sort of fire extinguishers attached to 'em just in case they did go up 'cause then you've got a serious fire. But gradually, sort of end of the '50s, they changed to safety film. So, that made a lot of difference. (film reel spins) The projectionist looked after the building, you know, you learn a bit about everything. Plumbing, paint, and you name it, we did it. - It's a giant poster. They call it 48 sheet, that would be outside the cinemas. You see 'em in advertising. You'd have a strip on it that says next week and it show the picture was going to have. Then my job was to climb on the roof, climb down there and put, today. - But one day the ice cream girl never showed up. And the general manager said to me, do you fancy selling some ice creams in the interval. (laughs) This is true. It's absolutely true. And he said, wear a white overall, he said. So, I, (laughs) I put the white overall on and went down there and I got a load of wolf whistles from girls and that, and even blokes, you know? And sold ice cream. Then I had to go back up the projection box and start the programme. - [Barrie] It was nice to know, get to know the electrical side and the mechanical side. It was nice to know being able to strip down a projector as much as you could, cleaning of the equipment, general maintenance of the equipment with the sound, et cetera, et cetera. - Yeah, I distinctly remember Ronnack Floor Polish. Now, any good projection room would have a gallon of seriously, Ronnack Floor Polish to do two things, polish the floor and lubricate what they call green prints. I mean, what you really wanted to do was just to create a little bit of a lubrication so that when it went to the projector for the first time, it wouldn't stick on the gate and create a clattering noise. - When you're running a film projector, you can get away with it with rubber bands and bits of gaffer tape. And the audience don't know. We've got a full house in NFT one, The film's broken, but it's broken below the gate. You just carry on running the film with a film running out on the floor because you got 500 people in there. It's still running. So they don't know. So, you don't stop the film for something they're not aware of. - I think one of my worst film on floor moments was breaking a film down and the cake stand pin breaking as you go top speed and just the whole film, or the rest of it, shooting across the projection room, hitting the wall, breaking the ring and just collapsing in a heap on the floor. And like you look at it and you're like, ah, cry or laugh? Cry or laugh. Walk away. Walk away first. - [Steve] And look, because the films here, we put 'em on the spools. You've got to physically check them to put 'em on to spools to run them. You got rewind benches. But literally you've got a motor on each side and you got a foot pedal and you just run it through your fingers as you physically look at it. You've got a light and everything too. You you're checking the right ratio. And if they can tear in it, you can't repair the tear. - [Ali] Sort of, I remember sort of rewinding for instance, "Mean Streets" after having just projected it and watching the film running through my fingers and stopping it and looking at Robert de Niro and thinking, wow. And knowing that the sprockets on either side of the film were torn and shredded, and that if I'd not looked after it, the next day when, or the next time it came to be screened, it could have just torn. And that film wouldn't have been screenable. - [Greg] The tape splicer became a boon because you didn't have to make a joint. With a tape splicer you could just tape over. If it's got a split, you could just tape over it, both sides. And that is as good as a join. Whereas, when the old cement joins that would've to be cut out, so you'd lose two frames. You didn't have to scrape both sides, put the cement on, go like that, hold it. And it didn't always hold. So, you had to do it again. - This is looking, actually, in the projection room. So, you would look at the, you'd have the portholes, which were the glass windows where the light used to shine through. Looking at it, you'd have a slide projector, then you'd have a stellmar, which would be a spotlight. Then you'd have projector one, projector two And then if you were really lucky, you'd have projector three, but that was very few and far between. And behind you, you would have the non-sync, which would be the record players. And in front of you you'd have a lot of buttons which would operate the tabs, which are the curtains. You'd have dimmers, which would operate the footlights. It was an art to drop your foot lights, strike your arc up, go to the projector, start it up, start to dim the Footlights, open the douser, check your sound, make sure the records just are going to finish just after the censor. And that's generally how it works. - But they're kind of, they're, yeah, eccentric, unique places and full of old equipment, full of new equipment. There's a real mishmash, particularly NFT one. I mean, it's a really storied projection box. And the fact that it's constructed almost entirely out of asbestos means you can't actually remove anything from it because the danger of pumping particles of asbestos into the air. So, old installations that are defunct are still there, just attached to the walls. And we've still got a shelf full of tape cassettes that we can't take down because we don't want to have to shut the projection box to get it cleaned for asbestos. So, everything that's in there is kind of built up over the decades. And it was first open in 1957. So, I mean, it is literally decades, you know, 60 years. - But I mean, the Prince Charles projectors, you know, all the sound system stuff and about 50 films and at least 20 of those made up on cake stand rings, leaning against the wall. So, which was a, is a shocker to a lot of projectionists, but it was just normal for me. Lob it off the cake stand, lean it up against the wall. - [Kore] Projection room will always be spotless. Yeah, absolutely spotless. I mean, from film because you couldn't allow the dust on film. So, I always find projectionists to be very tidy. - So, I think it's stuff like when we had a pigeon in the auditorium. That was the weirdest thing. It had got in and I was getting ready for a changeover and I looked out the porthole and this thing was looking in at me. And he's like, and I'm like, what are you doing there? And, yeah, that was weird. 'Cause it's trying to get the thing. So, you take the glass out, trying to get it to come in. At least it's in the projection room. You can get hold of it. That was funny. (film reel spins) There's something to be said about watching a film from a projection room, particularly when it's on film when you can hear the projector. It's like that thing is giving life to what's on the screen. - [Kore] That standing and seeing that first light hit the screen. I can see that a thousand times, it still has the same effect of me now. - I mean, and in the Scala Cinema, we had two big, I think they were Westexes. I can't be sure. I can't remember. And then another huge 16 mm projector, as well, which was a beautiful old thing. And yeah, they were quite, they were like dinosaurs. They were massive and beautiful. I loved lacing the films. I loved looking through the little box and watching the light hit the screen. - I mean, I think part of the old days is when you walk around, my goodness, every now and then you go out for a walk around just to clear your head and you hear the people lining up waiting to get in and the, you can feel the and anticipation of what they expect from a film. And obviously, in the cinema yourself, you're getting the oohs and ahs of the crowd as they're enjoying something or maybe getting scared if they're watching "Psycho" or something. Yeah. - Preview Cinema kind of bored me a little bit, 'cause you don't have the atmosphere over, you know, there's just like five people in there sitting, watching a film and they're analysing it more than watching it for pleasure. Whereas, in, you know, when you've got a whole audience and they've loved the film, especially in the old days, you stand up and clap. And that is a real buzz. - I think one of the most brilliant feelings you can get is when there's a packed auditorium and you've stood at the back of it and there's one of those like big jump out of your seat moments or big belly laugh moment or something like the end of "Free Willy" where the whale escapes and one of those hugely emotional kind of moments and you get people pouring out of the auditorium and they're just like, thank you so much. Oh my God, that was brilliant. I loved that film. (film reel spins) - It's one of the things managing anxiety because you can't get too anxious. You have to be a bit anxious but you can't get too anxious, otherwise you just to lose everything. - Have I laced up the projector correctly so that when I actually start it, is it going to actually start up properly and not stack or not jump or not be in rack or the sound loop be too tight or lose the sound loop or I mean, you know, when you're talking about something physical, the amount of risk of it going wrong because you've forgotten to do something 'cause you got distracted by something because you're having a bad day. - Well, one of the fears would be a rack. You know, and not noticing a rack. And it's actually been on the screen for say, you know, six minutes or something, you know? And people are, you can't hear them, but their words are going rack, rack, rack. Having a rack means that the picture on the screen is all of a sudden, the bottom of it is halfway up the screen. You know, and then you have to run over there and rack it down a bit. - Missin' a changeover is bad. But you could get over that by putting the next reel on quickly. You're talking about seconds. But I've known someone put a film back in the bin and not reword it, so. And if you don't watch very carefully, you put it like that and all of a sudden the film's upside down. And - But there is a projectionist's nightmare that a lot of us share where it comes in variations, but we walk into a projection room and for some reason we can't show the film. And that's either like everything, the equipment that you're looking at suddenly just becomes, you can't comprehend it. You know, something that you should know, you just, it just turns into something you just don't understand and you just can't make any sense of it. - This is a very basic thing. Make sure you got the right title, 'cause we've had this before, particularly working here at the BFI with all the stuff we've got over the years, you maybe have three or four different films called exactly the same thing. Well, famously in the festival the other year we had we as a brand new film, a film I think called "The Tree". And there was an Indian film called "The Tree", a British film called "The Tree" and an American film called "The Tree". Now, it didn't happen here. But one the outside venues, they've opened up with the director there and it's the wrong version. - I'd just finished being a probationary And I put on "Spider-man 2" instead of "The Hills Have Eyes". (laughs) I cried and phoned my mum. (laughs) - Someone once told me that their nightmare was that someone had taken like a big pizza cutter and had cut up the film on the platter like this, so it was just in bits. So, they couldn't show it. And then there were other people who say they've gone blind and they can't see what they're doing to sort of put the film on screen. (film reel spins) - Great trick was not to miss out a reel. My favourite was a Bergman film, with reel five missing. Nobody ever saw reel five. So, nobody complained. And of course this was the old projectionist way of ensuring that they got out of the building on time, was to, actually, just to drop a reel. - There are two camps of people that became projectionists. Those that do it because they are absolute film buffs. They have an encyclopaedic knowledge of film. They know all the actors and directors. They can name you every Oscar winner. And it's all about the opportunity to go and see a film, to watch film and to be part of it. And that that's categorically, the area they fall into. And then there's techies. People who are technical and that's what matters to them. It's about how stuff works and making stuff work. And there may be a part, an element of showmanship, but it's puttin' on a show and it's knowing that technical bit with it. And I definitely fall into that category, you know. My knowledge, everyone assumes that because I'm a projectionist, I am going to win the film quiz. I haven't got a chance. I can't tell you any actors or directors or anything. - I dunno. Sometimes you talk to a projectionist about what the film was like after a screening and they'll say, oh yeah, it was, yeah, it was good. 89 minutes, a few joins, bit of dirt at the ends of the reels. And I say, what was it like as a film? Oh, I dunno. - [Amanda] I love films, but I'm not a filmy. A lot of projectionists are filmy, where they have to watch everything. I'm not like that. I want to hear the clattering of the projector and making sure it all runs smoothly. That's what I really enjoy. - [Kore] You've got to really love it. You have to really intensely love the industry to want to spend that much time with the projectors, lovingly getting in the back of them, polishing up the brass, just because you kind of in the end, you know, I found my time sometimes talking to them and I just put it down to the fact that I was just in a room on my own. It's not social job. - Yeah, I think, often in the old days it was maybe five or six to a projection room. And you got that comradeship and you know, and I can say, if somebody had personal problems, you were there to have a chat with them. If you got a bit fed up, they were there to have a chat with you, you know. It was teamwork really. But towards the end when you're on your own I'd say isolation crept in. - So, I mean, I think the drinking became a problem when it was down to just one person alone. Because again, there wasn't a lot to do. I mean, if you had 6,000 foot spools, Xenon lamps. You had very, very little to do. - [Steve] But there is like the old story of, we are weird people who work in the dark for a long time on our own. And the thing is, you've got to like the job. Because I mean, in the old days it was long hours. You probably spent more time at work. than you probably did with your family. - The hours could be a little bit difficult, a bit antisocial. So, you probably, you know, if you were courting you probably met one of the usherettes on a night off when you were off. And I married one in the end. - I was really nervy when I first started. I used to kind of skulk from one projection box to the next with my head down, trying not to meet people's eyes. I mean, I guess that might be one of the reasons why I ended up as a projectionist, trying to avoid people's gaze. - It's incredibly structured environment. Everything is timed. You have to be, the film has to go on at certain times. It's scheduled for this time. So, it's all very structured. So, you know, like what work you have to do to get to that point in time. The structure of it's just so comforting. I like that about this work. I like knowing what I'm doing, when I'm doing it. - There's a lot of projectionists who are very happy and they like the job because they're on their own in the dark, in their own little world. And there's others that are kind of very social and like to go out and interact with people. There's also, I think there should be a study done on the amount of serial killers who've been projectionists as well. That is very much a backstory that could be explored. - Very, very sexist. That that's my big takeaway from it. It was so unbelievably sexist. But it was just the norm. It's what everybody, It's what everyone did. I think we accepted it back then. And what some of the guys would say to you, and actually, they knew boundaries and it was fine but you wouldn't get away with it in a workplace now. You can see that it was definitely an industry of its time. - I've actually been told to my face, we don't hire female projectionists. So, (laughs) like, it can be like that. So, - I worked really hard to learn the craft of it and the trade of it. And I also wanted to prove the other projectionists wrong and to show them that actually, I could do it. And nobody thought I'd be able to lug those cans up the stairs. Nobody thought I'd be able to make all those films up and handle the pressure of a film going. You know, a film, you know, the film breaking in the gate, or even just being able to do the changeovers when the changeovers were supposed to happen and the whole thing. So yes, I did really feel like I needed to prove them wrong, as a woman, that I was perfectly capable of doing it. - It was definitely an industry that attracted lesbians and gay men and gay men in particular 'cause of the whole showbizzy kind of thing to it. So, there were a few, I was very much, I was out to all my friends, but I wasn't out at work because you encountered quite a lot of, not explicit homophobia, but casual homophobia. And also, you know, you'd overhear conversations where General Managers and Regional Managers would say, oh, if I'd known he was a poof, I wouldn't have employed him. Or kind of like, oh, I'll have to work on gettin' rid of him then. And that would kind of chill you to the bone. You'd be kind of like these people could ruin my career. (projector hums) (film reel spins) (serene music) - Yeah, when Todd AO came out, 70 millimetre, everybody wanted to work at the Dominion, Tottenham Court Road, 'cause that was 70 mm. You know, that was the Harrods of cinema projection, for want of a better word. - Well, everybody wanted to work at the Odeon, Leicester Square, didn't they? That was like the mecca of, well, shouldn't say Mecca, 'cause it's another company. It was the place that everybody wanted to work was the Odeon, Leicester Square. I wasn't that bothered because I thought it'd be too much hassle. You got the Queen come today and you be thinking, oh no. - Yeah, it was 'cause we're a public funded body. It just was resolutely uncommercial and you know, people were there for art and for education and for film and there wasn't a drive for profit, as such. And that kind of filtered through everything. - In his own way, this is probably the peak of what you can do as projectionist because we do a lot of, we're doing world premieres all the time, now we're all doing the festival. But then we do get the big names turn up and I think it's different all the time. It's not like you're just showing one film five times a day for three weeks. Things here are different just all the time. - At the Scala, the auditorium was huge. It was a big palace there and the whole thing felt very special with the lights going down. And then the projector sort of opening up and the image hitting the screen. A massive screen, as well. And the auditorium was really raked with gorgeous plush red velvet seats and that sort of long carpet. And it was, I mean, it was, yeah, it was a very special place. And it felt like a very special experience, as well. And the Scala was showing a phenomenal programme. It had an amazing programme of films that you weren't going to find anywhere else. - I mean, the Electric Cinema was in those days, it was almost the doyen of repertory cinemas, in that it had great programming and really ran on a shoestring. And they did. You just, you were actually kind of sweated labour, really. You just, you know, there was no finesse to it. I didn't really, hardly knew what I was doing. I just did it. I mean, I had a list of films to get on screen and times to get them on screen by and I just cracked on with it. - We had great problems in finding anybody who was still working in projection from the circuits or independently, whatever, because the Electric was much, much more work. The outcome of that was we used to get people who were interested, who necessarily didn't know a great deal about projection, but we could train them. - They were normal projectionists. They just happened to work in the sex cinema. But it was just a weird place to go to. 'Cause I had to deliver the notices for the union meeting. I used to go around like an afternoon and tour the cinemas in the West End and hand them to projection. You had to go through one of the screens to go to the projection room, you know, to get to the back. And you walked in this screen and it was just, there was all these sort of men sat there with their sort of rain coats. And all you could hear from the screen was heavy breathing. And I thought, I just got to get through this and get to the box. And hopefully nobody saw me come in at the front door. (projector hums) - I'd gone to the Odeon Cinema in Epsom and in the box there they had a Vic 18 projector and they were trying this new system 'cause the Vic 18 you could run the entire programme. It had a, you could run the feature on the back, made up on one spool and second feature on the front. - You had a timer. And say, you're supposed to start the film in 10 minutes, you go, you press, get a little egg timer. It was like an egg timer. It just went round to 10 and pressed the button. And then it used to go tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. And then that would start the programme. And then at the end it would shut you down. 'Cause you put a little bits of metallic tape on the end of the film (hands clap) and that'd be picked up by a pulse and that would shut you down, play music, bring your lights up. - Everything was automated. You didn't physically start the show. - [Nigel] And they put in these longer playing platter systems, which would take the whole programme with one projector. - So, they were trying out for single manning. And that was a really, really early tryout. And they found it worked. So, that was the end of big crews in projection boxes and two of you on a day and so on. - In the '60s it would've been, some of the older cinemas, 'cause in America, they had these multiplex cinemas. But of course over here, we still had a lot of old original cinema buildings. So, of course, what they could do there, they could perhaps put two small screens in at the back of the stalls. - See, in those days, if you did well with a film, sometimes you had to get rid of it after a week because you had to 'cause you had your next film coming, even though it was sold out. So, if you've got three screens, you can then move that to another screen and run it for about 20 weeks, can't you? You know. That's what you did. I mean, "The Full Monty", I think we run that for about 18 weeks. Because you can move it to another screen. - And also they wanted to sort of cater for everybody so they could have an adult film, a children's film and a family film. So, you had more choice. - Triple wasn't enough. Let's have five. Oh, five's not enough. Let's have eight. I mean, that's what we ended up with, eight. - There was eight screens but two projection rooms and they were 60 odd steps apart. So, you start one ads and trailers then run upstairs to start another one. Then go to another screen to start that. Then go back to the first one to do the lens change for the feature. Then back up, then start another one. Basically, you had like five minute gaps. I was a lot thinner then because I was running up and down stairs so much. - When I moved from Shaftesbury Avenue to the Trocadero, which was seven screens, that to me was a culture shock. From running two screens to running seven screens. But by then it was all what they call cake stands and platters. - In the West End, we'd always rehearse prints. I had always sat and watched it anyway because as the cinemas were added, as the multiplexes and that, you never had time. You were just making films up and breaking films down. I mean, you could be in a 12 screen multiplex and half the films you'd never get a chance to see. - Well, when I started, there were, there was a team of five for two screens. Then we went down to four, then down to three, then down to two. Then we went to the multiplex. We went back up to three. But it was three people for eight screens. Instead of, you know, the workload was a lot more. - And you also had to operate 14 separate 35 mm projectors, which was laid out in a kind of very long V-shaped projection room. But we are talking, you know, it's a good two or three minutes running from one far end to the other far end. And the projectors were never like, oh, do this one and then it's the one next door on the way. It was kind of like, no. It's do this one, they run all the way around through the other end. Take that one then run all the way back to the other end 'cause it's that one. And you would have those projectors coming off and going back on, 14 of them within about half an hour. So, it literally was like spinning plates. - Projectionists who found a lot of their cinemas closing in favour of these big multiplexes, sort of opening, started to look down on the people coming into the profession at the time. So, one of the terms that was used was machine minder. So, it's derogatory. The idea is that they're just minding machines. They're not actually real projectionists. There was this kind of also conception that the multiplexes didn't really care about film. They didn't really care about the art of film projection or presentation. They just wanted to get audiences in and audiences out. - I mean, in my day, like ABC Circuit and the Odeon lads would probably tell you, Odeon, they were a family run business and they really did care about the staff. But in the end you were just a name. You were name and a number. It wasn't what I went in the industry for and the industry was changing. And when I had a leaving interview and the lady asked me why, I said, 'cause I feel as I'm working in a sweet shop now that shows films, not a cinema. And no, it's just the joy had gone. - So, there's a lot of criticism saying, oh, multiplexes are very sanitised. And they were just basically McDonald's with cinema screens on the back. And it's kind of like there might have been a few like that, but the majority, particularly the UCIs, they were run by really passionate people at that time who genuinely believed in showmanship and film and film marketing and doing publicity stunts. (projector hums) - We had the first digital projector that was used in a UK cinema in 2000. I mean, in those days, I mean, it's a bit different than it is today. We had a pile of discs that we had to put in the server. It took all day to load up. I mean, it's like watching paint dry, but now, I mean, it's all done from somewhere else now. - I was at the Prince Charles and we were always like about six, seven years behind everybody else. So, when digital started coming up in the other cinemas, I didn't have to deal with it 'cause we couldn't afford it. (laughs) So, we didn't want it 'cause we wanted to show films and we showed a lot of old films. So, you know, we never had problems getting hold of stuff. And obviously there was the day, the inevitable day where it was was installed. I hated it. I used to look at it like that. I hate you. And then you get digital. Obviously, it does make your life easier in certain aspects of the job. But it was never fun to show for me. And it was all kind of automated, so open your curtains for you and what ever. So, once you'd done the whole programming and loading up, it was just play. - [Andrew] You know, there was no joy in creating playlists and just, you know, setting timers going and relying on the automation for digital. - [Steve] 'Cause I think that Odeon, nowadays, I think all their cinemas in the country, they're programmed from either South Wales or Newcastle, where their headquarters are. So, you don't have anyone with any technical knowledge on the site of any cinema. - I think things changed enormously when digital came in and it was one of those opportunities for cinema companies to get rid of a lot of long term employees and replace them with kind of newer and younger people who'd be on more flexible contracts or zero hour contracts or, you know, lower pay rates. Projectionist was used to be considered skill, used to be fairly well paid. It isn't really any longer. It's just one additional kind of low paid job within the cinema. - You know, it decimated the industry in terms of getting rid of technicians and projectionists from all the cinemas and changing a hundred years of history and technology. But at the same time, we've ended up in a position where there are now cinemas in locations and places that just would never have worked if they needed projectors or film projectors, you know? And we've changed the way that cinema can consumed because we can move it into these buildings that weren't designed to be cinemas, but can be now. (projector hums) - When I left Picturehouse, I went to work for an AV company, installing education screens. I lasted three months. I just couldn't do it. I missed it so much. I went straight back and I went to work for Sky, In their cinema. That was when I started volunteering at the David Lean Cinema because I needed that fix. I needed that fix of being in the projection room again. - Then, basically, when the digital roll out came in 2011, it was obvious that, well, the writing was on the wall really. And sure enough, about a year later, they said my role was redundant. So, at that time, Odeon had moved into the IMAX and there was a vacancy up here. So, I applied for it. So, I was very lucky. I thought I got the golden ticket, really. - We knew we were going. So, they offered us a nice incentive, extra redundancy pay. And nearly all of us, like rats, left the sinking ship. - They kept offering redundancy, but I kept turning it down. And it got to what, right in the end, you could tell that they just wanted to get rid of you. You know, to get it over to not costing them anything to show a film and everything. And so, I did in the end accept redundancy in 2013. - On Christmas Eve at nine o'clock, 2010. And there was only two members left to say goodbye, a manager and one of the usherettes to say goodbye to me after 43 years. So, that's how the company thought of you at the end I think. (film reel spins) An enjoyable life. It's been a wonderful life, you know? Great film. (laughs) And I just enjoyed my time. I mean, there's been moments when I could have kicked the projector over and there's been moments when I could have kissed it. - It's meant a whole lifetime of public entertainment to which I've enjoyed. And I wouldn't have changed a minute of it. (soothing music) (static buzzes)
