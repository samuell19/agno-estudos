[music playing] [donkey hee-hawing] [distant braying] Alive. We take him alive. MAN [DISTANTLY]: [speaking arabic] [arabic music playing] Sit your ass down! [distant gunfire] Shit! Speedy, you got Billy. Two minutes to rendezvous. I'm on it. [dog barking] Morales, what's your 20? We're at the back wall. It's a dead end. No exit. Blow it. You got it, boss. Boomer. Boomer, do you read? Loud and clear, Cutter. Give us 3. We have the Tango. Need medical. On its way. Gotcha. You cover me. I'll carry this puke. [beeping] [pounding] [gunfire] [groaning] That son of a bitch. He killed himself. That's gonna cost a lot of American lives. Captain, you're hit! Archibald? Ah. Albert? Albert. Al. No. Austin? What, are we living in Texas now? Anson? Honey, I got a CU at Bragg named Anson. That it's just a bad, bad association. But why couldn't he be a girl? I know lots of good girl names. Oh, I'm sure you do. We could get out that little black book of yours. Well, um, that was electronic. You erased them all the night that I proposed. Come on. You know I'm happy he's a he. The kid's gonna be a quarterback. Support me in my old age with his NFL contract. God, I miss you. I worry about you. Well, look, I'm gonna be there in less than 48 hours. You still got two weeks. Nothing to worry about here. What about Brett, Jr? You remember the bad old days? Gone for weeks and no cell phone. I know. And I know your job is important right now. I'm proud of you. I love you. [honking] Hey, kids, the van's here. Listen, baby. I gotta go. I love you, too. Kisses to both of you. What the hell ever happened to Tom, Dick, and Harry? Like guy names. She's a lucky woman. He's a great husband. Hey, you know, I hear when the baby comes, the sex life goes, so maybe then I'll have a chance? You are so bad. Hey, that's why I'm in the service industry, honey. ANNOUNCER [ON LOUDSPEAKER]: [non-english speech] WOMAN: No, we live in Atlanta now. My husband works for the Center for Disease Control. We left our two children at home. My husband was trying to call them. I hope the house is still standing. No, no. No climbing, really, just trekking. Oh, you must be in great shape, Dad. You know, I tell you what, I could sure use a decent cheeseburger right about now. Oh, me too. It's so cool we're gonna be on the same flight, though. Yeah. I'll come back and visit you in economy. It's where all the fun is. [beeping] Ugh, Jesus. Hey, get your hands off of me, you creep. You should be grateful. Please excuse her. Get your bag. Jeez. Hey. Hey, we're already boarding. You better hurry. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. OK. [keys dropping] - I got it. I got it. - Merci. I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. I'm sorry. Are you an American? Well, actually, I will be in two months. Oh. I am going to New York for the first time. Do you know how long do we have to switch our flights in Frankfurt? I think it's about an hour. But we're holding up the line. Could you please-- Oh. Yeah. [music playing] OFFICER: Here you go. Thank you. No one's flagged this time, either by your people or Interpol, nor us. Good. Should be a safe flight. Yeah. Too bad there's no movie on this one. We got a 20-minute gate hold. Wheels up at 52. One gun on board-- your friend Prescott, gorgeous. Mhm. So what about that lay you were promising me in Frankfurt? I mean layover. Dream on. Hey, hey! That's harassment. Yeah? Sue me. Next time, how about bringing us some hot coffee, huh? You know, I would, but I only have a first class. Ouch. Welcome aboard, Senator Chambers. Hello. Right there. Thank you. MARIE: Good afternoon. Welcome to Transair. You'll find your seat straight back to your right. [chatter] MARIE: Hi, welcome aboard. Good afternoon. Senator Chambers is in 1A. What about Jake? I like that name. Hi, Fred. Isn't this Ricky? Yeah. Have a good trip, son. OK. Did you fix it so I could go up to the cabinet, Dad? Fly it? I'm afraid you can't do that with the new security rules. Give me a hug. Marie here will take good care of you. Yeah. Let's go find your seat. RICKY: OK. If you're going to enjoy the privileges of being a senator's daughter-- and God knows you do-- you're going to have to accept the responsibilities. That was inexcusable. I played my part this trip. So boring. Retards, politics-- boring. I didn't even want to come. Better than rehab again, young lady. Right here, Ricky. Thanks. - You OK, Ricky? - Yeah, I'm fine. Sir, I wonder if you could keep an eye on this young man? He's traveling alone today. Ah. Well, so am I. He looks like he could take pretty good care of himself, but it's always nice to have company. I'm Brett. I'm Rick. Richard Bernard Parsons. - Hey. I'm Luke. Hey. Nice to meet you, man. This looks like a good seat. You know this is first class? Yeah, I know. Do you? May I see your boarding pass, sir? 3A, that's right. Thank you. I bought an around-the-world first-class ticket before my company went bust. Your company? Yeah. Dot com? Yeah, afraid so. Software. Oh, man. That sucks. It did. It did. Yeah, but you still got that ticket. And you're here, so that's all good. Hey, where you from? I'm from the city-- New York. All right. I'm from New Hampshire myself, man. Well, actually, I'm originally from here, but now I live in New Hampshire. You know, like, live free or die. Well, this time, to tell you the truth, a man could freeze and die. BRETT: Have you seen the world, Luke? Nah. To tell you the truth, man, I've seen enough for now. Can't wait to get back home. BRETT: I hear you. Yeah. GROUND CONTROL [ON RADIO]: Transair, you are cleared for takeoff from the one-- cleared takeoff from the one-- - Did you get any of that? - I heard "Transair." It's good enough for me. Where would we be if English wasn't the language of air traffic control? You know, in the old days, before these things flew themselves-- well, anyway, I'm just glad to be retiring soon. There won't be any human pilots by the time you get to be my age. Flight attendants, please prepare for takeoff. MARIE [ON LOUDSPEAKER]: Ladies and gentlemen, please make sure your seatbelts are fastened, that your seats are in their upright positions, and that your tray tables in front of you are locked in place. At this point, we would ask that you turn off all electronic devices for the duration of the flight. Thank you. [grunting] [music playing] Nervous? No. A little bit, maybe. They say flying is far safer than driving your car. I've had a few car accidents before, but I didn't drove 30,000 feet out the sky. I think those moments when you know your plane is gonna crash must be the most terrible imaginable. You know, when you see a wing fall off or an-- an engine catch fire. I suppose it's the same in a car, you know, the moment before a head-on collision. Pow! Sorry. So yeah, those moments certainly are moments to test your faith. Are you a believer, madam? Well, all your talk is sure making me one to pray, I'll tell you that. Hey, what you reading there, Rick? Those are the days. This big sea planes took days across the Pacific. My dad got me the book. He's a company manager here. Ah. It must be really interesting living here. I don't live here. I live with my mom in New York. Oh, New York, huh? Great city. I live there, too. My mom's going to have a baby very soon. Oh yeah? So you're gonna have yourself a little, uh-- She's married to Dick. He was my father's best friend. Oh. What about Sebastian? It has a dignity to it. Hey Luke, how many NFL quarterbacks do you know named Sebastian? Exactly. Sounds like an accountant. Maybe he will be. Don't tease me. He could be tiny. Headset? BRETT: Thanks. Ricky. Thanks. Headset? Thank you. Is it OK if I move to the window seat? Sure. Let me give you a hand. OK. All right. Here you go. Thank you. Headset? Thank you. I'm sorry. Hey, man, I know ethnic profiling isn't politically correct if we're all part of the cosmos and all that, but that guy over there, he scares me. Yeah. Well, security seemed pretty good at the airport. Yeah, right. So you did Nepal, too? I hear they grow great weed up there. That's what I hear. Come on, dude. I am not a narc. No, not at all. You want to know something cool? What, am I boring you? No, no. Um, can you excuse me just one second? Yeah, if you promise to come back. We can, um, check out the mile high club. What? MARIE [ON INTERCOM]: Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the seatbelt sign. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts. I'm sorry, sir. The seatbelt sign just came on, if you wouldn't mind taking your seat. Do as I tell you, and you will live a long life. No tricks. I know them all. OK. Move. Slut. [knocking] HEATHER: I brought coffee. I told you she'd come back. Who is it? Heather. Not the same Heather who swore she'd only deliver coffee over her dead body? Yes, the very same. Well, I'm not sure we want coffee now. Maybe if you were offering something a little more-- I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Sit down! Strap yourself back in. No more tricks, Captain. You ought to follow my instructions exactly or I will kill her and you. Who will fly the plane? I will, though I'm sure this idiot can manage. Turn off the transponder. Do it! They'll be suspicious when we don't check in. Don't fool with me. We are well beyond air traffic control. Assume a heading of 24 degrees south until further notice. Do it! That's crazy. We'll fly right into a thunderstorm. We'll be on the edge of it, no problem. Forget trying to fool me, Captain. [whimpering] Now, where's your gun? We don't have one. Hey, the FAA hasn't approved it. Don't believe everything you read in the newspapers. It's true! It's true! It's true. It's true. The bullet proof door's the only thing they put in since 9/11. [screaming] That's one dead. There'll be two if you ever think of doing that stunt again. Oh my God. OK. That was kind of cool. Now you are going to make an announcement. CAPTAIN [ON INTERCOM]: Ladies and gentlemen, we encountered a bit of rough air back there. We will be encountering more turbulence, so please stay firmly bundled up in your seats. We should be landing in Frankfurt in plenty of time for you to make any connecting flights. Thank you. How was that? We'll soon find out. Uh, you guys? That was no air pocket. Oh my God, you killed him. Shut-- [ON INTERCOM] shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Everybody stay in their seat. [yelling] Shut the fuck up! Let me see your kid. Come on. - Mommy! - Shut the fuck up! Sit down! So we are going to have long flight, so sit! Oh my God, they're going to crash us! No. No crash. No crash. We need hostage. Right? Right. That's what they said in New York, man. Keep everybody quiet. I'm not sticking around for-- Be smart, not dead. Just fly. Don't anybody move. Man, will that work here? Ought to. Langley's best. FAA AGENT [ON PHONE]: Security line. This is Air Marshal Brett Prescott. I am on Transair 382-- FAA AGENT [ON PHONE]: Yes, sir. I'll transfer you immediately. No, this is an emergency. Don't put-- FAA RECORDING [ON PHONE]: You've reached the FAA Hotline. Listen carefully, as our menu options have changed-- Come on. FAA RECORDING [ON PHONE]: Press 1-- So you do have a gun. It's a Taser. It's a stun gun. It's not a real gun. It can't kill anybody. [phone dialing] Oh! No! Oh my God, you shot him! [panicked crying] All right, I want all cell phones. Now! You give cell phone, you're dead. Mohammed. I hate to do this. [beeping] [ringing] We've taken over the plane. Abdul killed one. What? Watch him. Do not let anyone in but me. You-- you are coming with me. Drag his body out. Do it. Do it! Make sure you lock this. BRETT [ON ANSWERING MACHINE]: Hi. You've reached Brett and Tracy. We can't come to the phone right now, so leave us a message, and have a great day. Take it easy, partner. These things cause cancer. And I don't have one. No! You think we're playing by the old rules-- Western rules. Human life on this earth is sacred. No? But for Mohammed to die a martyr is the most holy of acts. For you to die an infidel is our sacred duty. Do it. Brett! Jesus Christ, you killed him! There is a bomb in the baggage compartment! This will detonate it. Give up any idea of resisting us and believe me, we are all willing to die. Oh yeah? That's what they said in New York to control the passengers. There was no bomb. Shut the fuck up! OK. OK. Where the hell were you? You could have stopped him and saved Mohammed. But it was so much better than a movie. I was on the edge of my seat with my friend Lauren here, wondering what would happen. JAMAL: Mohammed was my man. And now he is with 70 virgins in paradise. Not my idea of a good time. What if they're ugly? You blaspheme. And you messed up, brother. We didn't need this if you'd handled the pilot. I told you my men and I should have handled it. Our air marshal. Ah, a woman. Pretty woman. What's this? Perfect symbol. The end of an empire. All right! Everybody get up! Move to the back! - OK. OK! - Do it! Let's go! Move! Move! Do it now! Let's go! Move it! Let's go! Move! - All right! Sorry. You, get out! You, move! Back to the plane! Come on, come on, come on. JAMAL: You sit right here now. Come here, Senator. Get out over here. Get out. - Ow! Nobody move! God. OK, miss, you can sit down. You can have my seat. Sit down! Next to him? Yeah, why not? Why not. Jesus! Sit down. Ow! [computer beeping] [thunder rumbling] [screaming] [glass creaking] Sit down, you idiot! [shouting] Come here. Go to the cockpit. Make sure Ahmed's got it under control. Give me your gun. So what about me? You'll take Mohammed's. Where is it? Just go. Go. Sit down. [knocking] So is all OK, brother? Yeah, fine. Come here. Have they made demands? No. We've got no contact. How do we know it's a hijacking? Housewife in New York. We're spending 30 billion on intelligence and you're telling me that-- that-- that some housewife is-- She's the wife of the air marshal. We have an update. JAMAL [ON RECORDING]: For Mohammed to die a martyr is the most holy of acts. Jesus. JAMAL [ON RECORDING]: For you to die an infidel is our sacred duty. [gunshots] [woman crying] MARIE [ON RECORDING]: Brett! MAN [ON RECORDING]: Jesus Christ, you killed him! The wife heard that? Heard her husband get killed? Brett Prescott's been killed in action before. Best shooter and looters special ops ever had. You knew him? Oh yeah. Well, I have to inform the president, but I need more. I mean, he's gonna want to know who to bomb next. Just kidding. I have nothing to say to you. The lives of these passengers are in your hands, Senator. The United States of America does not negotiate with terrorists. Terrorists? Who are the terrorists? The ones that bomb from 10 miles up, killing women and children. The ones who have no remorse whatsoever. Why do you hate us so? You obviously live in America. You know us. Exactly. I know your arrogance, your contempt for the rest of the world, your moral corruption, and your so-called freedom. Yes, the freedom that the rest of the world envies us for. Your freedom is a joke. The rich control everything. They control you, Senator. You're fanatics. That's not religion. You Americans are fanatics about money. Money, money! I stand for family values, spiritual values. You people have no respect for human life. You treat women like cattle. Us? What about your daughter? Is she a happy person? Drugs, sex, alcoholic. [speaking arabic]. Enough debate. It's midnight in Washington. Let us get to what they call the bottom line. Listen. General, let's keep this real simple, just you and me-- White House and Pentagon. No cluster fuck with FBI, CIA, DEA, FAA, huh? The plane's here, heading south. Libya? Or the Sixth Fleet. We're scrambling two F-16s. Come on. Come on! Come on, you piece of garbage. Hello. Can anybody hear me? Come on. God damn Japanese technology. Piece of garbage. Let's see. electronics. Avionics. Fuel management. Fuel dump. Oh, that'll piss them off. Yes. Ahmed? I'll be right there. [knocking] [beeping] See what your shooting did? We must have a hole in the right wing tank. No bullets went in that direction. Look at this. We're losing cabin pressure. Don't tell me that's not because of your bullets. I've got to take it down to 10,000 feet. Must be the avionics section. Someone. Stop it. I can't. Ahmed, go down there and check it out. It's right below us. Take the elevator. Go! We don't want you shooting up the avionics. BRETT: Come on. Come in, somebody. Come on. Can anybody hear me? Come in. Hello. This is Brett Prescott, Flight 382. Come in. You're alive! Brett, God! I have no idea how to work this radio. That's why-- [dinging] Hang on. They've figured it out. No, you stay. Are you all right? It's fine. Yeah. I gotta get topside. I'm no good to anybody down here. But you don't have a gun. As far as I can tell, they got three left. That's one for the cockpit, two for the passengers. I like my odds. Let me take a look at that. God. It's really deep. It's fine. Brett, you're no good to any of us if you bleed to death. Hazards of the job, huh? You just don't think it's actually ever gonna happen. Hey, hey, hey. The good guys are gonna win. We got the element of surprise this time. And the radio. You know how to work the radio? Of course. Thanks. Hold on. They've changed course 34 degrees. Looks like Libya's no longer on. In a few minutes, they're gonna be passing right over the USS Brattleboro. I mean, not to mention civilian cruise liners. They wouldn't be that crazy. The president said it's our call. He knows we're minute to minute. This is a decision I never hoped to make. How do you weigh lives on a plane versus lives on a ship? Look, if they go kamikaze, we're gonna lose the people on the plane no matter what. Let's at least try to save them on the ship. No. They shoot us down, it'll be over nothing. No, no, no. You agreed that if the first plan didn't work, we would take out an enemy target. It can still work. Look. This island, it has a landing strip. No. No. No, no. No. No. Jamal, don't you want your bother free? What about the other prisoners? Our brothers would be more proud if we did something bigger. We have very little fuel. The explosive effect will be minimal. It's the symbolic effect. Elijah, think. An aircraft carrier-- the very symbol of American power. You are dreaming, brother. You are dreaming. We can free the prisoners and get the money. Money for the network, for more operations. Money? It is not about money. [speaking arabic]. Look out the window. [speaking arabic]? Good. The passenger list. Damn. They don't have the nationalities. Chambers. Jesus Christ. Senator Chambers? And his daughter. He was on that senate mission to the Kremlin. Damn. Of course he has to be in our party. Well, not only is he butt buddies with the president with golf and all, but we're taking control of the Senate here. He's the swing vote. Maybe you're right. All right. All right. All right. Why isn't Ahmed back? Hook me up. Yeah. Yeah. Patch him true. Put him on speakers. This is Air Marshal Brett Prescott on Transair 382. Your wife will be glad to hear that. BRETT [ON SPEAKER]: Who am I talking to? Bob Cline, White House. Hey, Cutter. This is General Watkins. Old Boomer Watkins? I told you you should've stayed in. It's safer. You'd be a full bird behind a desk by now. Yeah. Well, you know me, sir. I'm terrified of papercuts. Here's our situation. We've got six hijackers, two confirmed dead, one out of action. We've got about 50 passengers, two dead that I know of. And the senator? I'm sure he's OK, sir. Listen. I've dumped about 70% of the fuel. They're gonna have to land soon. The two leaders are fighting. One wants to play missile. The other wants to go to a nearby tourist island. I don't know-- hang on, sir. They're sending it. Patch us through. We don't know if they're going after a ship or not. [MUSIC - BILL WANDEL, "DOS HABANEROS"] ELIJAH [ON RADIO]: Django. Django? Come in, Django. Django, ndale! Elijah. ELIJAH [ON RADIO]: Come in, Django. OK. Where are you, brother? Here all under control. No problem. You? Perfect. Better than planned. Good. We wait, brother. We wait. ELIJAH [ON RADIO]: Have you called Switzerland? Yeah. No money yet. Early still. Better get it. See you soon. OK. Let's get coordinates ASAP on where that's coming from. Must be that island. Thompson Island. I'm voting for greed of this one. We better get some firepower on that island. What are you thinking? Special Forces. Reed. Taggart. Taylor. Here you go. Anybody else? Everybody got frags? Take us through here. All's good. Got clips? Weapons check out. [groaning] [speaking arabic] Hey. Hey. Hey, who did this to you? I need you, brother. Wake up! Right here. Right here. All right? Go to the cockpit, OK? And don't trust Elijah. OK? And I'll be there in a moment. Go. Go! Go! [whispering] Well done. Well done. Any more tricks and I will blow the plane up. Do you understand? Don't. Let me do it when the time comes. I know how. Bingo. Demands. What the hell is this? Eight prisoners, we're holding them? You know any of these names? No. But God only knows ever other one's Mohammad. And look at this. They're demanding $30 million in a Swiss bank account. No surprise. That's good news. They sound ready to deal. Could be a trick to drop our guard. Well, they are heading for that island. Or ship lanes. Well, we're covered for both contingencies, right? Special Forces on the island, F-16s and anti-air if they go for a ship. All right, Mr. Air Marshal, I know you're down here. I'll give you 10 seconds, then I'll kill her. I want you, not her. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3-- you're a good warrior. Killing you will bring me fortune as God will smile on me! I'm Harish Bose, sir. Harish, where the hell did you come from? May I ask you a favor, sir? Please do. Could you obtain for me an employment in Germany? My position is very difficult here, sir. Harish, I'll be happy to do whatever I can. But, uh, at the moment, my position is rather difficult. We'd better get you to the hospital, sweetie. Your contractions are every five minutes now. No, I'm not due for two weeks. I'm sure they're just Braxton Hicks. False contractions, really. Let's go. They must've blocked it. Is there another way up? There should be a hatch in the baggage compartment. [knocking] JAMAL: [speaking arabic]. Get up. Yes, I said get up. Sit there. [speaking arabic] We have no choice. There are more than 1,500 people on that ship. Arm the missiles. PILOT [ON RADIO]: Sir? WATKINS [ON RADIO]: You heard me right. The order is armed missiles. Roger. [violent beeping] [speaking arabic] ALL: [screaming] [speaking arabic] Prepare to fire. 25 seconds. [whistles] Shoot me. Do me the favor. What's a minute more of life, anyway? This crazy locked himself in and is heading for a ship. God help us. Get the hell out of the way. 10. 7. You see? Security's a double-edged sword. 5. Security my ass, pal. WATKINS: 3. Fire. Copy that. Now up, buddy. That's a hell of a pilot to avoid a missile at that range. Prepare to fire. Roger that. Hello. Can you hear me? - Yes. Yes, you're patched through. We have control of the aircraft. Hold fire. [laughing in background] I repeat, we have control of-- Uh-huh. Son of a bitch. That is, the moderates have control of the aircraft. The good news and the bad news. I believe we can negotiate. They have no kamikaze interest. Great. What's their plan? They're heading away from that cruise liner. Thank God. They're on course for that island. Looking like a good old fashioned hijacking. Money. Damn it! They're all up front. Listen. We have a chance, OK? All right, gentlemen, let's roll. Ah, Jamal, Jamal. Oh my God, Dad. Oh my God, are you OK? No. Hadji, [speaking arabic]. The air marshal, tie him up. No innocent has to die here today. The American government is rational and values your lives. All will go well. And if you behave, we all leave. Senator Chambers, please, I need your help. I do not negotiate with terrorists. Let that be on record. Let me shoot him. Hadji, that's an appealing idea, but unfortunately, not all hostages are equal. I need him as a live body for now. Yes. I need someone believable. Senator Chambers, as a politician, is by definition a liar. Mr. Air Marshal, you get to live a while longer. Hey! How many people are here now? Who am I talking to? The White House. The president. No, this is Robert Cline. I'm authorized to act on behalf of the president. Bobby Cline, the fundraiser. At least you understand money. Where is my money? You're asking a lot. Now, we're willing to release prisoners in exchange-- Come on, Bobby. You have a $50 million fund for rewards for so-called terrorists. It's a simple accounting matter. Send 30 and you save 50 lives. It's a bargain-- 600,000 per person. Dead, they will cost a lot more. You hear me, Bobby? Send 30, and you still have 20 left to offer as a reward for-- for me. How do we even know that the passengers are still alive? Senator Chambers? Hold on. Cline, Brett Prescott, Air Marshal. Prescott, this is General Watkins. BRETT [ON SPEAKER]: Yes, sir. What's the situation there? We're OK, sir. He's right. We've got about, uh, 50 live passengers on board. I want to talk to Senator Chambers. Um, I don't think that's gonna happen, sir. He's OK. He's just not here in the-- Listen, Bobby. Listen carefully. You have five minutes to deposit that money, or we begin to deduct passengers. Did you get that? Understood. DJANGO: Yes! Yes! Yes! Yeah. Oh good. Now do the transfers. S . Yes! How far are we? Well, if the coordinates you gave me are right, about 20 minutes. But I can't find this field anywhere in my database, and I have every field in the world in there. No, no, no, no, no. Captain, it's there. I know it's on the map. My colleagues just landed there. Yes, sir. 15 minutes, sir. Better now than wait. We can do this. Copy, read out. One round and it's all over. No. The chopper has to be there when they land. They got hostages. We need surprise. Let's take them. ALL: [laughing] I feel great! There it is. Go. OK. You, up. Why? We know who you are. Your father will pay millions for his favorite daughter. Move. Django! Django! Django! CAPTAIN: You've got to be kidding. Up. Both of you, up. You might as well shoot me. So we all die? I hear you landed on a carrier during the Gulf War with your rudder shot off. You can do this. PASSENGERS: [screaming] All right. This is it. I came in too high. I need every bit of that strip. Well, at least we're back in first class. We've got to try again. We've got to try again. [music playing] MAN: We made it! [hysterical laughter] And watch your head. Watch it. Single file, please. Women and children first. You're safe. You're safe. You gotta go. You gotta go. You gotta go! You won't get far. I wonder which will give me a greater satisfaction-- killing you now or having you live with the fact I got away with $30 million of the great Satan's money and live happily ever after? What do you say? I'd say that's a fairy tale, asshole. And fairy tales just aren't true. Say hello to Tinkerbell for me out there. MAN: Hurry up. Everybody out. Everybody out. Be careful. Watch your head. Watch your head. [speaking arabic]! What took you so long? [speaking arabic] [speaking arabic] Omar, hey! Come on! Come on! Hey! Django! [speaking arabic], come here! You bastard, you take my money? Raise your hands slowly. Slowly. Very slow. [speaking arabic] [speaking arabic] Well, hot damn. You air marshals show up in the strangest places. Yeah. Well, I had it totally under control till you guys showed up. - OK, Ricky, it's your turn. - No. I want to accompany you. I go with you. No, sweetie, you gotta go. No! You gotta go. Christ! There's still passengers on board. Reed, turn this puppy around. I don't want to miss my flight. We're moving? What the-- Faster, Captain. Closer! Closer, Reed. Almost! Get in! Much faster, Captain. Much faster. Get his hand! I got you. Come on. Much faster, Captain. Shut up! Much faster! Shut up. It's on full power. Buckle yourself in. You OK? Yeah. You're really cut. It's OK. Daddy. Thank God for kids like the United States Armed Forces, those bastards won't get away. Sir, there are still passengers aboard that plane. Yeah? Who? ALL: [cheering] Hold on. Hold on. Quiet! The plane's back in the air. What? There are still passengers on board. At least the senator's safe. Yeah, he can play the hero card. Stood up to the terrorists. What about-- And the $30 million? Gone. We tracked it from Panama to the Cayman Islands. Then it disappeared in cyberspace. How could these bastards be smarter than us when we set up the whole damn system? You're just lucky those passengers got off back there. If we had the same load we came in with, we'd have never got this crate off the ground. What now? We got maybe 180, 200 miles left in the last tank. Might have a shot at making the American military base-- No. No military base, Captain. The beach here. If you could land on that field, you could land on the beach. We better check who's still on board. Give me the gun and I'll go check. Better I have it for him. The passengers think you're a hostage. You won't need this. What about the air marshal? Don't worry about him. He's still hanging from a ladder on that island. Now I want you to find out what they're planning. Here, take this. Jamal's bomb detonator? It's a tape recorder. A $30 tape recorder, but it helped us get $30 million. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Yeah, I think so. It's just-- it's my head. What's happened? The gun. Where's the gun? What? Get back! Get back. Let me by or I will blow up the plane. I'll kill everybody. I'll do it. [middle eastern music playing] Not my kind of music. You want to live? Hey. Shit! [clicking] [cracks] [groans] Tie this this piece of garbage up. OK. She's been hit. What a load, eh, Captain? Holy cow. What's the situation? Well, in a word, I'd say hopeless. Hopeless? No fuel. What's the nearest air field? None. Well, except maybe one. Don't tell me. Yeah. Well, you did it once, right? You know what the odds were that time? - What? - You don't want to know. Are we going to land all right? It's been real scary so far. You can say that again. BRETT [ON SPEAKER]: That's about the size of it, General. It's been a long day. We should be on the ground in a couple of minutes. Or in the ground. Hang in there, Cutter. You've done a hell of a job. BRETT [ON SPEAKER]: If, uh, you could let my wife know that I'm-- better wait till we're on the ground. I'll talk to her directly. You got it. We're running on vapors. It's got one try. - You can do it, man. No way. You want me to get out and push? Gosh. I need a few more drops of fuel. - You OK, Rick? Oh. It's OK, Ricky. [violent beeping] It's OK, Ricky. [grunting] Ow! All right. I'll take it from here. Go, Rick. Keep some pressure on the artery. MARIE: OK. Uh. Um. Flaps. Flaps. MARIE: Flaps. Flaps. Flaps. RICKY: Uh, right there. - Where? Where are the flaps? Here? There. There, I think. OK. Oh my God. Hold on, Rick. Brakes? Brakes! Where? Where? Here? Right there. The brakes are there. Oh my God. BRETT: Whoa. Dad! I can't believe you did that. Never bet against a couple of New Yorkers, huh, Ricky? Thank God. I see you made it. Prescott, how's Captain Nichols doing? Well, sir, he lost a lot of blood, but he'll pull through. If I know Nichols, this time next week, he'll be telling cocktail waitresses hero stories. Sir, I must say something to you. I expected Frankfurt to be something more different, sir. Yeah, sure. It couldn't be more perfect. You're back safely. Baby's healthy. But we still don't have a name. Well-- hey, come on in here. Honey, I'd like you to meet a real hero, Richard Bernard Parsons. - Oh, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Tracy. Brett told me how brave you are. I wasn't really, but-- Oh, and this? This is Richard. Richard Prescott. Yes. Um, here's a gift I got for your newborn. A gift, huh? What-- [laughing] [music playing]
