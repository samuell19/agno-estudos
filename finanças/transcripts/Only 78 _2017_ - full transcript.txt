It will inevitably fail, we're just gonna repeat 1983. It's gonna give, the harbor's gonna be flooded, the lower half of the village is gonna be wiped out. They want to focus on cities where there's lots of people and lots of income being generated but we're contributing members of the society as well and we have rights and we pay taxes. Whether you think climate change is a result of human activities or not, it doesn't matter. This is a young changing planet. I think it's disgraceful of the federal and provincial government, that they can't split the cost of fixing that damn wall 50/50 and then work it out between them later. It's our home and we will do what we can to preserve what is here and if the worst happens, what is left. We feel that there is a community that should be saved. Here's the first one under the G, 52. - I'll take 59. - I'll take 59 too. Under the I, 21. Concentrate, people, concentrate. That's a lot of cream cheese everywhere. Having lived in a small community, well Tim did too. I didn't have a big preconception, truly. The only thing that we didn't know was the politics of this particular town and that was gonna influence any number of things, not just... Our being gay but my being black. Going back 12, 15 years where newcomers basically weren't welcomed with open arms, I mean, it was kind of, I suppose, a closed, almost like a closed gate community. - I'll put some aces down. - Hey. - Oh, he's got aces. - They really didn't just accept everybody. And I can remember my mother in law telling me one day that this man, a businessman was in the village and somebody invited in him to dinner and it was in a Protestant home, he was invited and when he sat down the table and he crossed himself, he was asked to leave the house. - 45, N45. - N45. The last few years, it's a very dramatic change. Two years ago, Gloria and I just did a quick survey and we were surprised in that basically 2/3 of Gabarus are now, would be considered newcomers, which surprised, I think basically it surprised all of us. - Whoo, bingo! - Bingo! - Solidarity, baby. - We haven't talked about that That's not that hard. What was more interesting was, not that either he was black or we were gay, it was that we were from the states. - We were Americans. - We were Americans. That was the big deal. It's a big hurdle when you come here because Americans don't have a very great rep in Canada. You look at the weather in the United States, isn't it amazing that the weather map ceases to have information at the Canadian border as if no weather comes from the United States from Canada. It has the lower 48 in the map and Alaska floating up here and Hawaii floating out in the Pacific but there's no connection, there's no land connection between Alaska and the lower 48 in the weather maps in the United States. - And sometimes... - So Canada is not there. And sometimes there's not even an indication. 90% of Canadians live within 100 miles of the stupid US border. One of the firemen had come up with a nickname for us which was salt and pepper, I thought that was kind of cute. Hmm. But when we met Mildred, the elder of the town, and she had heard about it through the grapevine, she told the person who said that, you won't be calling those boys that, she thought it was an insult. When I was growing up in the summer, we spent a lot of time playing around the beach, swimming and in boats and catching fish with a stick, with a string on it and a common pin. They called them skull pins, I don't know how to spell it, even. Mildred Gray was born in Gabarus, she married my father, who was also from Gabarus and he was a fisherman. My mother, she was a telegraph operator and a telephone operator and then she was very involved in the community. So yes, please, help yourself. So... so you be sure to eat that. Help yourself, yeah, I put bowls there too - for your fruit if you want. - You went on ahead. Oh, you did, Gloria, you didn't, Gloria, look, there's a thing over there that'll take that better. - Here. - Oh, okay. - Oh, that's hot. - There's lots of food. So we met Rhodena the next day and John. She knew that Gabarus in order to survive had to have new people come in so she was glad to have new people arriving and it didn't matter to her the category of new people as long as they were people who would love Gabarus. Her collection of some 60 years worth of clippings about the schools and about the churches. She was very protective of all her material. She wanted it done up in a book and everything and she talked to different people but she would not trust giving it to anybody for fear that they were going to... Plagiarize everything. Oh really. So for her to come out and hand it to you, is... is really... really unique. - Hi, Barry. - Hey, Barry. Come on in, bring a chair. My wife and I moved here to Gabarus about five years ago and as you can see it's breezy up here and we call our little house Which is Gaelic for top of the wind. We were here on the cruise and we stopped here. I fell in love with it and I came out and I bought this house and then I told my wife which itself was a colorful experience. Once she got here, the people were so incredibly welcoming, she fell in love with the place too. We moved here about four years ago. We had been looking for a summer place and fell in love with the village, I do international project management here We came here to check out the place and it was a sad little house. My husband said that there's no way we're buying it but I bought it anyway and when we looked out back you can see in the bay here, that's the reason that we bought it. I'm formerly from New York and Philadelphia and I have been in Gabarus since I retired in 2006. I was on a group tour in Ireland and this gentleman leans forward and says, you can work on my boat anytime and I thought that was the best pickup line I ever heard and I turned around and met him and his wife. They took me to Gabarus to show me where they were going to retire, and I fell in love with it. We're very happy that we've moved here. It was one of the best decisions that we made. Came here, our grass was all cut. We were welcomed into their homes and welcomed at their dinner tables and into conversations, it was a very exciting thing coming from away that we were welcomed to that extent. We thought, well, you know, everybody here is like that, we're gonna be in a really good space. ♪ It's a little piece of heaven ♪ ♪ Nestled in the rocks ♪ Protected by the spirit ♪ Protected by the fog ♪ And the lighthouse on the level ♪ ♪ Will always lead us home ♪ Through stormy weather ♪ It's the calming of the ♪ Calming of the storm ♪ And when we'll be ♪ More than happy There's four more pieces of halibut if anyone wants one. ♪ If we're ♪ Back on the bay ♪ I wanna be ♪ Back on the bay ♪ Where simple is the only way In 1929, we had a severe earthquake and at that time it wasn't a seawall as it was now. It was, we always called it the brush fence and it was just posts in the ground. People were rowing boats even up here where I lived and then of course after that, the government owned the... the brush fence or the seawall as it's called now, it's the last section of construction, I think was in 1946, the federal government owned, maintained it. People in the village after that storm got together and bought planks and put some more covering on it. People often call that the boardwalk because hundreds of people walked there in the summer, tourists and people alike. - Hey, Wayne. - How you doing, Tim? So I didn't time it right, I didn't get here when the work was all done. No, that's what, you gotta do that better. I guess I shoulda waited another half hour or so. Well, yeah. In 1983, the seawall was breached during a terrible storm and the boats were upon the road just over here. There was just piles and piles of wood, smashed buildings and wharves and it was a bad storm. And after that people talked about replacing the boardwalk, but that went nowhere. 2010, the storm we had then was in January. Seawall was breached and the waves were coming right over the top of it, this back here where my wharf is in the bay, we had the water come over for the first time and just threw it over and it was just totally just torn to pieces. After 2010 a terrible storm struck and within 24 hours we saw tremendous damage and shifting of the seawall. It became clear to us that there was a history here, that there was a terrible chance for this community to be damaged by another storm of that strength or stronger. I'm an engineer, human structures don't last forever and they have a natural life cycle and I could tell from looking at it that it was beginning to reach the end of its useful age. The problem I think could be with others coming 'cause this community is actually growing so we're getting people here from, really interesting people from all over the world and certainly the site of the disaster when it happens, the horrific pictures of the boats overturned and houses flooded and smashed is going to have a terrible impact on our capacity to grow this community and in fact on Cape Breton and its reputation worldwide as a tourist center and... and Canada. Coastal communities are affected by climate change in two ways, one is the increasing severity of storms and therefore the increase of the... in the height of the storm surge and secondly on by sea level rise, in the case of Gabarus, they are sitting actually in one of the hot spots for land sinking in Nova Scotia. We expect about 30 centimeters of sinking in the next 100 years plus 70 centimeters of sea level rise so they're looking at probably a forecast of one meter of local sea level rise. We're gathering here today to help people get a better understanding of what this seawall means to this community. It's been breached in several storms now and it's at the point now where really, it's done its job. You can see where the wall has been breached. There's a separation here, it's not gonna take much more for this to be completely gone and then once this is opened, it's just, the rest of it will go. Have a look at this, the wall is leaning down this way and if you look further down it's becoming impossible for people to walk on it. This used to be on the upper part, a boardwalk for people to walk, it's a seawall. Some folks here from Gabarus have decided to take matters into their own hands. The wall is leaning so far that we thought maybe we could hold it up if nobody else wants to help us. You'll notice some folks have life jackets on. They're future planners because if the wall isn't repaired we're gonna need life jackets. I'd say that it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when the seawall breaks, if there isn't some urgent action and some attention to it. And should that happen, it could close off our harbor and make it unavailable as a fishing harbor and it could do tremendous damage to all the fishing infrastructure, even if the harbor remained open. The fishing day starts at 2:30 when the alarm goes off. Pack my lunch, board a boat roughly by 3:30, we spend roughly 12 hours out in the water hauling pier, checking traps and moving 'em, baiting 'em, getting lobsters and back home by 12, back to the wharf by 12 and then we get our baits and all that ready for tomorrow and I'm home by two o'clock, shower and relax for the day. It's been estimated there are at least 30 local jobs and maybe as many as 70 that are indirectly tied to the fishery here in Gabarus. Not all of the fishermen who are here would continue in fishing if the harbor failed because they live here. There's no other nearby harbor that could accommodate their boats and they would then have to move and many people are at a stage in their life where they're not prepared to do that. I got people calling me up all the time asking me what's going on and stuff on Facebook all the time and I send them pictures and everyone's worried, just not the 78 that live here. I was always aware of the seawall, I was concerned about the seawall because I'm fourth house up which means if the seawall breaks, I'm gonna be swimming and all we need is a good hurricane and that seawall will go. We feel like the history here and the people and the economy are all worth investing in because the money that's been derived from taxation that goes out of here each year from the landed catch which might be $3 to $5 million a year worth of catch, lobster, crab, scallops, halibut, mackerel, about 52% of that, 52 cents of every dollar goes to one or another taxing authority but very few of those dollars and cents come back here. We'd like to see the cents come back into the government and some of the dollars to come back here. And so we thought, well, we'll fight for this. This was a federal structure. There shouldn't be a huge problem getting the federal government to live up to it's obligations. All we have to do is, you know, make some noise, show our concern and the government would respond. So we thought. ♪ Back on the bay ♪ We can walk around Roses Island ♪ ♪ Carve our dreams in the sand ♪ Watch our daughter grow up ♪ Strong and free ♪ Ground into this land ♪ And if we hold on tight ♪ We'll make it through ♪ But this sea is killing me ♪ We gotta get out ♪ Of this place ♪ Please I live here on Gull Cove Road in Gabarus. With my wife, Jacklyn Holmes and our friend Katherine Harris, we own Rising Tide Expeditions. A sea kayaking tourism and instruction company. We've always enjoyed rural living. We enjoy being outside in the woods and on the ocean, kind of making and doing on our own for ourselves and Gabarus is just a beautiful quiet place. My husband at the time was not my husband and he had planned a six day trip. During that trip, he proposed, which I didn't, I wasn't expecting and so that was pretty exciting, and so our first time in Gabarus was camping on the very kind of outer ridge of Gabarus Harbor at a place called Gul Cove Village. The next day when we woke up we paddled in and took a look at Gabarus and went wow, what a cool, beautiful place. - I feel bad for that lobster. - Why? There's more lobsters in there. Do you want to pick one up? Reach in. There we go. - Good job. - Oh, what is she doing? - Whoa! - What's your sister doing? - Helping. - Yes, she is helping. Keep going. Oh goodness, I wouldn't have thought, because when I first looked at it I thought it was Albert. - No, it's mine. - Yeah. Would've been... That's their three children. Auntie Waynes, when they were little. Y'all know who this is? - I don't. - No. Have you got a magnifying glass? I do. 1983 was when the seawall came apart. Yes, yes. Mildred and Duncan and what is it? A Wedding? - 40th anniversary. - We were so sick and tired - of washing dishes up there. - A dishwasher. For their 40th anniversary. I should become a traditional Gabarus. - We all three of us gave that - That's Maureen there. - Is that our Sandra? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Oh my goodness. We had another huge storm and it did a lot of damage to the village and to the boats and the wharves. And how we started out of course was with a general consensus of talking to one another and said we have to do something or you know, our village is in jeopardy. The people decided they would have a meeting to see what could be done. Our seawall has protected not only the fishermen but the homes located around the harbor too. I think of the situation now with the seawall on shaky ground. I was there in 1983, the last time the seawall broke and I saw the destruction that can happen. I saw the seawall then and now, and it's in far worse shape now and much easier to break through with higher tides that experts and our fisherman are telling us. Out of that meeting, they formed a committee called Friends of Gabarus. Who actively got involved and we went to Province House first up in Halifax and from there, it just kept on snowballing because we kept on getting one referral after another and one party after another saying, it's not our problem, it's not our problem. Since everybody's here, for the question, who owns the structure? I've been at this for years and I have yet to come up with an answer. This is an information session, but we can assure you we know who owns the wall, who owns the harbor. We also know that ownership is not equated to responsibility. Who cares who owns it? We need to have responsible people step forward and say that this isn't right. We need to have it fixed. We're one wave away and we, in the past, before yesterday, we're speaking about, wow, if we get a big storm, it's gonna be gone, well, no, the study comes back and says, if we get a high moon and a high tide, that wall could collapse at any time so time is of the essence. The Atlantic Ocean doesn't give two hoots about us, but our elected representatives really should care because that's why we put them there. The mounds of emails and papers and so on that they've sent back and forth would surely fill half a room of a normal bedroom size and they just would not stop. Well, the seawall issue has been an ongoing item for a number of years in community of Gabarus. I had a number of meetings with local fishermen who were concerned about some of the aspects of what might happen if the sea wall were ever to give up and then we moved along and talked to try to get some activity, but as you can understand, there's many, many files that we are working on. When the seawall really became a work in motion, I guess, is what I'd like to call it is really when the community got involved. So this is how I start, I start with a little bit of water and a little bit of... Sky. So that would be my light for the lighthouse and then I'd glue all this on, wing of the seagull there. It's tedious work but I love doing it. This is how I would finish this, I put it in a shadow box. Oh, I put some sand down here and some seashells to depict a beach. This was the original road to Gul Cove and this is where the forefathers of Gabarus lived, was out in Gul Cove and it's about four miles from the cemetery, so that's what we're doing is trying to make sure for our 300th anniversary, that we have a good path going out there so that people can go out and visit the sites of where their forefathers lived. That far point out there? We call that North Shore over there. Around that point, the town of Louisburg, the fortress. The pivotal part of the French Indian wars and the battle for our continent also played itself out right here in this bay. Louisburg which was next to Quebec the mightiest fortress in North America was built at such great expense that... that... Louis often said he expected to look out his window at Versailles and see this thing rising up out of the Atlantic. The history of Canada in terms of European settlement began here, largely and Gabarus played an important role and particularly Gabarus Bay in the battles between the British and the French over domination of North America. This area was first settled by Basque fisherman and whalers that came here in the 1500s, that Gabarus Bay and the village of Gabarus are named after a Basque fishing captain from that time. Following that were the French that settled the French fortress of Louisburg, settled this area. But the fall of Louisburg meant the doom of New France because the following year, the English fleet were able to get up to St. Lawrence, bypass the fort which was guarding the river and lay siege to Quebec. And when that was settled, at least in this area and eventually across Canada and the United States, it changed the future of this area. We've got all these little things up the treads on the stairs, the old part of the fireplace was down the basement, half buried in mud when we moved in and so we put that back in but I never knew what to do with the mantelpiece, so I decided a picture, a little sketch of the village would work so that's the harbor and that's the way it was when we first moved down. This little piece of driftwood from the beach, it spoke to me. My husband Peter and I are from Toronto. We came to the east coast and thought this is the place that we'd like to build a retirement home somewhere in Cape Breton, went to a real estate agent who sent us off with directions to find a half built log cabin that she thought we might be interested in buying. We followed the directions and never found the log cabin and when we came back out to the road, we thought Sydney was to the left instead of the right. Turned left and got to the end of the road which happened to be in Gabarus. And then she went to do a presentation in Paris about the letters, so I wrote to her. - Was she alone? - There's actually three separate ones. In 2012, the Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans decided that most of the lighthouses in Canada would be declared surplus, which means they are not gonna be maintained and if the government is able to get rid of them, they will pass them off to local communities, if no one's interested in taking them over, the lighthouses will be torn down and replaced by a metal pole with a red light and a little solar box on the top. Find someone who can actually pick it up and move it. And they are gonna have to get underneath. Well, that's why I wondered how rotten it was. I don't think it's really rotten. Some of the corner pieces are a little bit rotten but underneath seems to be fairly solid. If you go inside, it's like the inside of an old ship. The effects of sea level rise on local communities are obviously that we need to strengthen existing infrastructure like seawalls or, if the sea level rise is drastic enough we may actually have to relocate existing infrastructure like lighthouses, that's the actual impact that it's gonna have on a community. The connection with Gabarus is through our undergraduate students who have been involved over a few years in different capacities with helping to get the Gabarus Lighthouse Project off the ground. Maritime markers like lighthouses and navigational aids are something that people identify with their own culture and to eradicate that I think would be a really sad thing for all of us and we lose out on an opportunity to educate and celebrate the cultural aspects of maritime life. When we shared that with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, the response came back no, we've studied this, there's no danger. As a community, we have applied to take over ownership of the lighthouse. We are going to work incredibly hard. We're gonna do everything we can to save that lighthouse and we is the village. As a... you know young mother in my nursing career, I didn't have much time until our daughter grew up and went away to university. I sold my first painting in 1972. And it was probably one of the happiest times in my life to think that somebody liked my art well enough that they bought a painting. I mixed up a nice dark color so I used blue. Burnt sienna. It's my favorite way of doing a rock and all of a sudden it looks like a rock and then I have rocks in through here, big wave coming over. We've seen repeatedly over the past few years some terribly punishing storms and with that we're at risk of losing part of the wall or as the province said in their coastal hazard assessment, and engineers later confirmed, it can fail in several places, not just one. Little doubt about the fact that the federal government in particular and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans specifically has been absolutely resistant even though there's ample evidence, the seawall is owned by them and in fact is in documents showing them owning it. There have been a couple of levels of government that have been responsive and that would be first the municipal government committed some resources, $100,000 from sustainability funds derived from federal funding to help repair the seawall but it was contingent on provincial participation as well as federal. This is a letter that was written on behalf of the community by our member of Parliament, Rodger Cuzner which pointed out quite clearly, Department of Fisheries and Oceans had a continuing obligation to maintain the seawall and that in fact they were not doing so. There's been material sent to us that have sender, recipient, date, signature. That's it, everything else has been redacted. Oh, come on, come on. What's interesting is, you know where the seawall is? This was built 1955, '56 and it is a creosoted timber cribwork just like the seawall and it was 90 meters long. And it's almost gone. It's almost gone away. Now to another part of Nova Scotia that's experiencing the effects of storm surge, the community of Gabarus is concerned about its protective seawall. As the storm rages on today in Cape Breton, people in Gabarus are calling it a near miss that further proves the decades old wall needs to be replaced. This video taken just before yesterday's high tide shows huge storm waves threatening dangerously close to Gabarus's decrepit seawall. Tim White says the surge nearly broke through. The waves were breaking up to 12 to 14 feet tall, a couple hundred meters offshore. The waves are still fierce today as the seawall, leaning and buckling after decades of service, fends them off. But Tim Menk of the community group Friends of Gabarus says this storm shows just how close the village is to experiencing serious flooding. It would take just the right or say just the wrong wave and combination of high tide, full moon, storm surge. In January of last year, the Cape Breton regional municipality promised $100,000 to fix the seawall if the provincial and federal governments would put up the rest. Fast forward more than a year later and the rest of that funding still hasn't been secured. This fall Fisheries and Oceans told Friends of Gabarus it would not pay to replace the wall because although Ottawa built it, the structure sits on provincially owned land. Now Menk says his group plans to file negligence complaints against DFO. I believe that the government needs to pay attention to this because we live here and they want to focus on cities where there's lots of people and lots of income being generated, but we're contributing members of the society as well and we have rights and we pay taxes. An engineer came out and did a study and he presented his results including the fact that if the seawall really were breached in a bad storm, the water could come all the way up to my house. I'm still glad I came here. The cost to rehabilitate the village after it's been destroyed by a wave is gonna be tenfold what it would cost to fix that wall. I am very optimistic, that first of all that nothing will happen and secondly that it will get fixed. However, if it did come up and damage or destroy my house then I probably would not stay here. I think we would want to stay. I don't think there's anything that would impel me to leave this community at this point. I think Gene feels the same way. It's our home and we will do what we can to preserve what is here and if the worst happens, what is left. Probably at 1/3 of the lower of part of our historic village will be gone. I'm not afraid of struggle, I'm a Quaker. It's not in my nature. There's a saying about Quakers, we don't bend very easily. And so standing up for what we believe in is not a problem and that was the attitude I came to Gabarus with. When you're laying in bed and you hear that wind coming from the southeast, and blowing up the harbor, you know there is a big storm is gonna take a pounding on the seawall. There's gonna be damage. Disavowal of responsibility by the provincial and federal governments, they just say it's not their problem, it's our problem, it's somebody else's problem and the thing that would make me most angry is the government showing up after that. The prime minister or one of his delegates landing here in a helicopter, driving down and saying what a sin it is that Gabarus is washing into the sea? When they haven't done anything about it. Basically, I just want to encourage people to embrace the 300th since we are twice Canada's age in 2017, I would suggest that we might want to consider having this celebration go from now until the sesquicentennial of Canada. Couple ideas that I have, one would be to... Have some kind of a four by four rally race that would use the old French road, 'cause we have to get to a stage where we've got traffic on that road, it's the oldest road in Nova Scotia and they closed it. Sit, sit, Alfie, high five, high five, come on. Aw, that's the boy, good boy. Went to the states and came back, I was able to show them a Canadian passport which was really great fun, such a relief in a way to have it settled and to know that we are people of status in both countries, so. So you probably know about the hookers, do you know about the hookers of Gabarus? They're a group of women, Diane Harris started this group and they meet on Tuesdays at the... now at the fire hall, before it was at the community center where they do, they hook rugs. Interesting. - How many bows do you want? - Five. - Gumdrop cake. - Gumdrop, yeah. - I've got some gumdrop cake. - Are you playing darts? - Oh, here it is. - After three weeks - of not finding it. - You got that, yes. This here is flowers here and it says here, dare to be different, one of the flowers is different than all the rest. I got a couple on my wall, I did a lighthouse for my home, I did that. And a compass face, it's called, and I have that on the wall, that's the only two. There's only 78 people there, why don't they move them out, move them to Sydney - or some place? - Imagine. Yeah. I'd never leave here, it's part of me, I couldn't. I'm a third generation fisherman, that's blood. It's in you. What I don't understand and continue to not understand is the reluctance on the part of the government to do any repairs, to see the seriousness of it. I gather that because there are so many other communities in a similar situation they're afraid to open the floodgates and if they fix the sea wall in Gabarus then there's very little that stands in the way of them fixing others. You know, there's always an argument that who owns the property, the property itself is owned in part by the federal government and part of it is on provincial land. The two levels of government are saying it's not our responsibility. Meanwhile, the people here in Gabarus, every time the storm, you hear about a sea storm, you shiver because you know the seawall's gonna take a pounding. Governments are lacking wanting to communicate, they made a decision across the board that people from across the country, when you deal with DFO, send in reports, they're asked to look at efficiencies, is the word of the day, efficiencies is a very nice word for usually cuts. About 22 of the 23 largest cities on earth are coastal cities and they harbor about at least 60% of the world population. There's trading routes, there's rich fishery so it's no surprise that everyone lives coastal in a way. Losing access to coast and coastal infrastructure is gonna be something which will matter to us in a big way. We can't understand why the heads of the government are not interested in a little place like Gabarus with only 78 people. Would they take responsibility if those 78 people got drowned tonight with a ...with a storm? And it could easily happen. When you're born and brought up in a community, it's a part of you, nobody can take that from you. If anything majorly happened to the seawall, it busted, honestly I don't know what I'd do. I'm 50 years old, we're not asking for money for tourism reasons, we're only asking the money for to keep our way of life, our fishing area, the community itself, for another 20 years, Gabarus will still be here. We don't want to be shipped away some place. It must be possible to make it possible for them to give the money to keep those other communities alive and not washed away to sea. We live on a dynamic planet. Whether you think climate change is a result of human activities or not, in some ways it doesn't matter. The vast majority of many people in the world settle on riverbanks and deltas and oceanfront because that's where people earn their living. People often live on coasts. This country has a lot of coasts. Our job then was to convince skeptical people of the facts of the matter, that it is a federal obligation and that protecting coastal communities under threat from sea level rise and climate change related issues is a part of the job of government. I'm a businessman, usually when we do things, we set out a task and we put out who's responsible. We also put a time and date in there. I'm wondering if you can tell us how long this is gonna take before you get back to us because we have a serious problem that just isn't gonna go away. I'll get back to you, Wayne, as soon as the ministers get back to me. That's a nice political answer, Alfie. Wayne, I'm gonna make the call tomorrow, I'm going to Halifax tomorrow morning. I'm gonna put a call into both houses tomorrow and hopefully they'll respond. Has anybody approached DFO through small craft harbors? I don't know if it's the seawall or it's what's put up with armor stone for a while until they come up with some kind of a major repair, but I don't understand why DFO's not in there putting funds forward for small craft harbors. Gabarus is a divested harbor and the divestitures, somebody would know that date better than me but the divestiture took place in the late '90s, 1997, '95, I'm sorry, '95, so there's, that would be the difference there, so. I'll take the mic. Actually the harbor was never divested. What was divested was the wharf. The harbor was deproclaimed. In the 1990s when the government decided they had to balance the budget, Canada was going broke, Paul Martin was the finance minister, just put the brakes on everything and at that point the government began abandoning a lot of things that it had traditional responsibilities for. Began getting rid of airports, got rid of harbors, we just, it was just a flight from responsibility in order to be able to meet the financial requirements of trying to balance the budget. I think that that momentum has continued. That is the period when they began to abandon harbors here and seawalls, but the point is you can't own something for the better part of 3/4 of a century, build it and maintain it all it and then just wake up one morning and decide, we don't own it anymore. We don't know who owns it, but we don't own it anymore. It's just not legally, it's not sound. It's astonishing to me that the government views this issue just in terms of whether it wants to protect its shoreline as opposed to being worried about protecting its historical heritage. You know, you're talking a number of homes that if that seawall breaks, are gonna be washed out. And... And that for sure will ruin the heritage of the area because this is the heritage, the fishing community, the camaraderie that takes place in the community. It's not a question of just 78 people, it's a question of are we going to abandon our shoreline. Are we going to abandon our local fisheries here? Are we going to walk away from 1000 years of history here? It's not about 78 people, somebody's missing the bigger question here. So this is the thing you were telling me about? - Yeah. - That's in the... I never would have dreamed when we started out that we were ever gonna show up on the front page of the Globe & Mail. I would've thought it'd be a stretch to think we'd ever show up in the Globe & Mail period and I think when this article came out then it became real for people here in the village. Our MP at the public meeting we had back in January identified a place I'd never heard of before like I'd never heard of Gabarus before I came here, Little Anse was having problems with DFO with a seawall or a breakwater... Was that Rodger? - Yes, it was Rodger. - Rodger Cuzner. Rodger Cuzner, yep, and the idea that we weren't the only town, the only village that was having a problem with DFO sort of struck a chord with me that maybe there's more than just the two of us. Well, that's, given my experience in government, There's always gonna be others in situations like this. I told you before that my thoughts on that are like it's like the choking of the small communities in not just Nova Scotia but across the country, we've decentralized everything, removed everybody out. The community of Little Anse which is potentially exposed to being cut off from the rest of Isle Madame because of just a barrier that's been broken down over the last while, I look at other areas of the provinces like Advocate Harbor, which is receiving very substantive federal investment in their seawall. I traveled to Advocate Harbor, I went down to see what was going on in Advocate Harbor, it's about a million and a half dollars they're putting in there and it's about a kilometer from a commercial harbor and the DFO is preparing this land for sale. It's a strange one to justify, but nonetheless they're going forward and they feel that they'll be able to sell the property behind the seawall once they move on it. We have two factors here, one is global warming and sea level rise because of ice melting and there's just more water around and the other thing is that in certain parts the land is sinking. As it happens, Gabarus and Little Anse are right here in that red part where we look at about 20 centimeters of sinking irrespective of sea level rise, right, so the land goes down, so this is on top of global warming and sea level rise, which makes it particularly, these two communities are particularly vulnerable. In Little Anse we have a problem with our breakwater. As you can see behind me I believe over my right shoulder that there's quite the hole in the breakwater and any times there's any type of northeasterly winds or whatnot, the water just comes in and it ends up affecting our beach and affecting our road. At times we have had... Storms that... Damaged the road going across, blocked the road off with quite a bit of water. I don't understand how the Canadian government can justify doing a lot of the things that they do because they'll fund food for someone in some third world country, I have nothing against that, you know, but if we're gonna go to war and we're gonna go disrupt the lives of people overseas, we should look after our own first. Once upon a time I did a coop term for DFO. You have the numbers that come across your desk. You don't see the people and you can't afford to see the people sometimes because that complicates the picture. Then they start making the economic argument that the village is too small, any number of other excuses they have, what they don't realize is if they don't fix it, the village gets even smaller. The water still comes up, a foot and a half or two feet of water in the main road, an ambulance might not be able to get by. Causes great concern because we have a lot of elderly people living here. This is my home. I've lived here for 56 years. I'm not going to go somewhere else unless they carry me out that I can't take care of myself anymore. That breakwater was built by the government. The dike was built by the government. The wharves were built by the government. Now they say they don't own it? We need to complicate the picture. We need to make them see it's people and when you take away the infrastructure and the livelihood of the people, you kill the communities and when you kill the communities, you kill the culture. I've been to Little Anse and visited with the people there and their sea wall issue, but the community never seemed to have the drive behind it that the village of Gabarus had. I've always believed that my job as a politician is not to take on a project and to make it happen. My role is to help facilitate what the community wants. Once the community decides that this is what they want, then a politician should be there to help them to get the guidance to find open the doors and do that because if the community hasn't decided that that's what they want for their community, it's not gonna happen. This is government's responsibility and you've got a line that was issued by one of the ministers of government basically saying that, the government of Canada can't be expected to protect every inch of the coastline. Well, that's precisely what their obligation is. So I'm sorry that you're receiving this negative response but you know, this... We're looking for someone to get our hands on and unfortunately you just happened to show up here. You happened to be here. We've been red flagged, as you say, 18 months ago. You as the emergency measures coordinated for the municipality, up until appearance here tonight, what have you done? Well, if something was to happen out here and someone called 911, well, for example the police department has watch commanders on duty, like they're on duty all the time, if something serious was to happen that information would go to the watch commander. 'Cause we're not gonna be able to get up and go knock on everybody's door at three o'clock in the morning, we might not be able to get to them but could we get some kind of an alarm system, a tower? This is not a situation where there is a general risk of something unexpected happening. There's an identifiable structure that has an identifiable function whose efficacy is failing. So you know, this is not about if, this is about when. We're always willing as far as our administration to work with the local departments to assist them to develop whatever plans they might need. And we don't want the fire department to have to make that plan because there's liabilities associated with that plan not being made correctly. Please, just a plan, we just need ABCD, this is what we do in the event of an emergency. We hear your frustration and we're not saying we disagree with you, but a lot of the questions you need answers, we can't answer. Some of the stuff that you're talking about here is your elected officials. Nobody seems to want to take responsibility but at the end of the day it's all our responsibilities, mine as an elected person, you as people that work in the civil service. I think it's disgraceful of the federal and provincial governments that they can't split the cost of fixing that damn wall 50/50 and then work it out between them later When the numbers come out, they're gonna be so damning in terms of the impact, the financial impact, not just on this community but on CBRM and on Nova Scotia, it will make fixing the sea wall seem very, very, very cheap. And a plan should be developed as a result of the risk hazard and I'm just not sure whose responsibility that is. I sorta get global climate change, I was a subject matter expert in the US government. I understand that the people who don't believe it, people who do believe it, it sorta doesn't matter. We live on a dynamic planet. Change is happening, change is happening to all these small communities on the coast and all the small communities on the coast rely on first responders and CBRM as a first line of defense, the community is living in real time. It's happening to us now. I suspect there is somebody who's sitting there who probably needs to know in real time that the bad thing that we hoped wouldn't happen is happening right now. What is it we need to do now? I want to know, what are the environmental costs that are gonna come from that breach? How many lives are gonna be lost or at risk? What property damage, what is the insurance claims, are we gonna, I mean, what did it take to clean up in '83? Probably, by the way, far less than it's gonna take to fix that wall. He's got a point. Trucks have been rolling through town with large rocks, large armor stone, the work that everyone thought was never going to begin is underway to reinforce the seawall. I want to welcome you all. It's certainly been a journey for us, back in March of 2011 when this all started, trying to get a sea wall and then some real eager hands took over and some very credible people jumped in and said hey, let us help you. In recognition of this tremendous effort, it reminds me of Churchill saying, never has so many owed so much to so few. If the community had not come together behind the Friends of Gabarus which was relentless in making the case for saving this village, we know that the wall was finished just in the nick of time, given the winter weather we had this year. We would have absolutely lost the bottom end of the village. People until they actually saw the trucks arrive and the construction equipment on the beach prepared to do repairs on the seawall. Nobody really believed it. People were generally surprised that these guys were able to pull this off. Nobody ever thought that FOG would succeed. This just isn't a place, it's a community and it's people that care and it's people that matter and we couldn't have done this without you guys standing behind us every step of the way and we want to thank you. Does anybody have 59, does anybody have 59, do we hear 59? I'm sure nobody drinks wine. - 94. - 16 at the back, looking for 20, 20, I have, going once, 2020s, sold to number 50 for 20. They're small communities that you know are featured in little stories here and there in the paper but I don't think there's been that real gel of the people like we have here and I attribute a lot of that to the newcomers that have come in here. They had more experience fighting government and not accepting no as an answer and they did this in conjunction with the people that lived here. Our project was the one that sort of got things rolling, it was hardly anybody who believed we were gonna have any success. I think that's when we became a formidable group to deal with. - Tim. - How you doing, Tim? - Good to see you. - Heather. - Hi, Heather. - Hi, how are you? Gene. Is it completely, like, silent on the DFO front or has there been any effort to try and get them to do anything since? Well, it was idle for a little bit, then I was fortunate enough that my wife and I met Minister Le Blanc who basically said, you know what, I wish I could help you right now, it's just your harbor's no longer a core harbor. DFO is not gonna be able to give you any money for that stuff. It is still the policy of the federal government of Canada to encourage people to remain living in coastal communities and fish, okay. Then it is the obligation of the federal government to make sure that those communities prosper. I don't care who's elected, I don't care who's not elected Fix that and fix it today and my and your home and family are just as important as anybody living in downtown Montreal, Halifax, Toronto. I grew up here, I know, I know what goes on as well. As Friends of Gabarus, offering our help and our expertise in, like, our sister communities with our media outreach, with things we've already discovered. We're all in the same leaky boat together, and I said to Rod, we have to learn to bail in unison and row in the same direction. If we can do that, we might have half a chance of surviving. And not spend half our time arguing who gets to be captain. Certainly a great pleasure for me to join you here in Gabarus to participate first in your 300th anniversary celebrations, and to present the Lieutenant Governor's community spirit award. A community is more than roads, bricks and the mortar that it contains, but those physical aspects are needed for a community to function. What brings a community to life is certainly spirit. We are not just recognizing the service of individuals, but the service of a whole community. Congratulations again and thank you to all, thank you, merci. The history and the heritage of this community, when you go back to the first recorded settlement here of Gabarus in 1716 and you look at all the history forward from the Basque on, a beautiful close knit community is celebrating their 300th anniversary, marking the 300 years of fishing, friendship and commitment to community spirit. Gabarus has received the Nova Scotia Lieutenant Governor's 2016 community spirit award for their continued dedication to the well being and rich heritage and history of this area. ♪ Here I stand a 100 years tall ♪ ♪ Had memories behind my wall ♪ I remember every empty grave ♪ I remember every face and every name ♪ Isn't it a great day to be from Gabarus?

I think the most important thing for small communities that have difficulties similar to our own or have their own challenges is never give up and never surrender. You need to have the attitude that you can do this, that it is possible, to fight City Hall. If you believe in democratic process, then governments have to be given the chance to respond to the needs of the people and if the people are silent then government can get away with doing as little as government wishes. Hello, whoever you are, we believe that when God created the earth, he started with Gabarus. The purpose of this is to go in this time capsule. It's to be put in the ground under the lighthouse and in 100 years time it's going to be dug up and it's rather exciting at the age of 84 to be able to do this. This particular one is for the Gabarus lighthouse. It'll have a story about the lighthouse and why it was moved and that sort of thing. Other people around the village have written stories, added some historical information and they have their own individual time capsule. Seal it with a kiss. I hope whoever gets it will love Gabarus as much as I have. The contest is called This Lighthouse Matters. It was sponsored by the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society and National Trust for Canada. The reason why the lighthouse hadn't been petitioned for at the last moment was in large part because the community of Gabarus was making sure that the seawall issue was dealt with but when we started discussion about the lighthouse it was clear that oh yes, we want to walk and chew gum at the same time, we agree this is absolutely important. We were able to recruit consultants who did an excellent report who said yes, there is a danger and they recommended that the lighthouse be moved back a bit. As a village of 78 people, no one gave us much hope of winning anything. We were able to win $50,000 which proved to be enough to move the lighthouse and do some of the repairs that are required. I'm putting that dish liquid on the beams so the rails will slide on top of it, make it easier, 'cause grease is not environmentally friendly but detergent is. We started last week getting prepared for the building, level it off because it was 10 inches off level on the top and we started to lift and as we started lifting the wind come up, in a matter of 15 minutes the building was rocking back and forth eight inches. A lighthouse 22 tons in weight and extremely top heavy from cast iron being inched along steel rails to get it away from the coastline. ♪ I'm almost home ♪ You'll never be alone ♪ I will find you ♪ I won't give up ♪ You might feel small ♪ But you're more than enough ♪ We've still got ♪ A lot left to do Sea level rise is one of the more difficult things to estimate because we have a very poor understanding of the melting of glaciers of ice. Scientists are typically very, very conservative in their predictions. Current predictions range anywhere from 20 centimeters by 2100 to two meters by 2100. But it's quite possible that we go beyond that scale. Two meters is similar to the storm surge we had at the Hurricane Sandy and that created a huge devastation on the eastern seaboard, right, so two meters would be really catastrophic. If you think about it, you have to resettle 60% of the world population in the next 80 years, that's a major effort. Could be us today and somebody else tomorrow but we're all on the same planet.
