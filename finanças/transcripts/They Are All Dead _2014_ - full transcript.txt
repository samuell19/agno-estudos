Everybody would like to have a rock star mother but that's because they've never met my mother. Ever since I can remember grandma hoped Lupe would come down for breakfast with us. As for me, I'd stopped caring. Sometimes Pd wake her up with music but she didn't really like music anymore. Shit. I was raised by Paquita the fighter as grandma liked to be sailed. Pancho! - I hate her. - Stop talking nonsense, let's go! She took care of me while Lupe stayed at home making apple pies. I loved my grandma very much and hated the pies. I'm leaving without saying goodbye. Because I know that if I tell you, Have a look! You'll want to leave with me. Madrid is so ugly. Rancheras make everything prettier, don't they? I'm leaving without saying goodbye. And I don't want you to follow me. I knew my grandma all too well and when she put on Mexican music in the car! It meant something wasn't right. I invoke you to come down to my body. I beg you to come down to my body. I've been to countless doctors. They all agree on the diagnosis. So give it to me straight. That same day I met Victor. We needed a guitarist for our Christmas conceit. Victor was the only one to show up. Hey! I've heard the Beavers have a band. You know them? Beavers! To the lodge! You're gonna have to find someone else. What gives? Did you eat? Don't ask. Drive it up on the sidewalk. Now! Grandma forced me to take Lupe to the Night of the Dead. She said she had something very important to sort out with you. Come on! We have to sort this out once and for all. One, two and... up! Fuck! She bit me! She said you'd left behind a lot of unfinished business. Are you OK? And that's why Lupe wasn't doing so well. She's my daughter. It's impossible to get her out of the house. THEY'RE ALL DEAD Lupe wouldn't come to the ceremony. That day I learned that sometimes, when something doesn't go your way it turns out to be for the best. Wait here. Put this on the altar, carefully. Lead us not into temptation and deliver us from evil. Amen. Lost in my sorrow Lost without your love... - Here I am. Can I help? - No, she'll help me. Sit down. I don't want her wandering around, getting high. She became immune. Even 20 Valiums wouldn't knock my Lupe out. I banged her head and she woke up. Never mind. Paquita, you're my best friend. Do you trust me? It's all right. Leave Lupe alone, and we'll bring Diego. Are you crazy? - My son is dead. - Exactly. Today he can pass through the veil. Today he eats what we put out for him, he drinks what we leave for him, and he hears us. Why don't we try to get him to appear to Lupe? They sort things out, he comes back here and... No one has to know anything about it. If you'd rather not, we won't. Go on, then. I'll try anything. Let's wait until night. And the best thing that turned out was that grandma, that day, brought you here to save Lupe. I'm pissing myself. It's like I haven't had a piss in years. Lupe? I don't feel well. I'm going to my room. KEEP OUT How did it happen? What? How did I die? This is his room too. Whose room? Why are Diego's boots there? I don't know. Don't touch them! Don't touch them, mom. It's... Sit down. Loony Stop it! Eat. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down. Go away. Mom. Mom. Do you know why I'm here? No, of course not. We're leaving now. OK. - How long will you be in there? - An hour. I'll pick you up at seven and we can rehearse a bit. OK. Give me a break. Is that the loser from the audition? Yeah. Shit. You know whose son he is? Ouch! I don't know how to do it. - Do what? - Leave. Come out of there. I guess that now we're a kind of legend, right? Hey, how about a walk? Here. It's for you. Pancho! The other day I acted like a dickhead. I'm sorry. For Pancho OK. How about a couple of shots? - I can't. - Come on, man. Just one. UP To you. All right. Fuck! What were you doing in the bathtub? It's already half past. I've got a bunch of pies to make today. I don't even recognize you. Let me in! That's all we need. Don't be stupid. Go out that way. You've blocked up the basement. You have to leave. No. The moron has my room, and the basement is locked, so the bathroom is mine, Lupe. I'm not moving. You don't need to be jealous. Give me a break... Jealous? That kid can't stand you. And you don't like him either. You don't have to like your children. Get out. Let's get away, far from this world you and I. On a journey through infinite galaxies towards the sun. Nothing can keep me in this world anymore, not one min... Pancho. Pancho, what happened? Are you OK? Since when do you care? It can't be fixed. You can't be anyone's mother, Lupe. It's ridiculous. By the way, forget it. There's nothing left in the basement. Like mom says, it's bad luck to keep a dead person's belongings. Want some? When will you tell me about your mother? I'm dying to meet her. What's she like? Special. I guessed that. Will she come and see us at the concert? I thought you didn't want to look stupid. No way, I'm cool with it. I'm crazy about synths now. The CR40 is the best, isn't it? There are better ones. If you say so... - What are you looking for? - A word. Which one? Synthesizer. A friend can play it and I want to know what it is. Maybe that's not the best place to look. More. Come on, a bit more. Look. Come on. Come down. - Where are we going? - To Greenland. - That's neat. - Keep it. Keep all of it. You look happy. Some style! "10,000 people packed the arena. Greenland set Las Ventas alight with a resounding performance". Why does no one remember you now? Come on. Why...? Why did he say that no one remembers us? Because it's the truth. Qualified beauty consultant for Marcel Cluny ANDINA HAIR TINT Enchiladas or chilaquiles? Enchiladas. Victor would prefer them. Victor? He's Pancho's friend. He's coming for supper. I'll make enchiladas. I don't want anyone coming for supper. You never want anyone to come. He wants to meet you. For him, you're a star. He can see animals in captivity, in a zoo. We don't have visitors. Come upstairs! It's over. This is over. You have to be the person Pancho needs. Starting tonight. Victor? Thank you. This is incredible! You'll have to forgive us, we're not used to having visitors. That's OK. - I'm Lupe. - Victor. It's delicious, mom. Didn't you ever think about taking up singing again? Diego learned to sing when he was six. He couldn't say two sentences in one go. He had a stutter. He didn't want anyone to know. By singing, he managed to say his first sentences together. I didn't know. Every time we went to my grandma's my uncle would play "Corazon Automatico". I remember we played it over and over, like loonies. In the end, he gave me the record. I've kept it for ten years. It doesn't have a single scratch. I always wrote in my diary that I'd love to be able to see you in a concert. And now I'm here! You wouldn't believe how hard it was for Diego to go out and perform at his first concert. He was shy, like a snail. Lupe, however, was born with a lot of character, strong, rebellious. Beautiful, like a Poppy- I'll get dessert. I've got something to tell you, something very important. Forget everything, nothing will be like before. Everyone tells me it's great, normal people have it, and if I play a record, I move in an elegant way. - Un souvenir we marmalade Vous ?tes pr?te? Je suis pr?te! Get ready, Pm coming to pick you up. Cheer up. I've got an automatic hear? to make you happy. A romantic robot without any wires. Pancho wants you to help us pick a song for the concert. It'd be very important for us. I didn't know you had a concert. I've been out of touch with music since the accident. What accident? Diego died in a car accident. I was driving. We always drank before we went on stage. It livened us up and, well... After a concert, we'd drink a bit more, to celebrate. That night I drove us back to the hotel. Diego was... sleeping like an angel. He never knew a thing. There's this girl who won't slop calling me. Have a lot of girls fallen in love with you? A few. But I'm not interested in girls. All I care about now is music. That's why I'm so glad to have met you. Same here. Lupe... Forgive me. I've been behaving like a moron. I... I had no idea... of what you've been through. It must have been torture. And I wanted to tell you that I... forgive you for having killed me. That's it. That's it? That's it. That's it. That's it. You son of a bitch! Shit, Diego! What song do you want to play at the concert? "A Scout". We could play a Greenland song. - We can't do that. - Why? Because it doesn't go. I dream day and night of being a scout, of shouldering my rucksack once again, o? emotions, songs and hopes and of the friends that the woods will give me. Look at me, God in Heaven, answer if you hear my song, you know that I'm a man, and so I will fall. Wait. Haven't you thought of getting another singer? I don't believe it. I'll have to talk to him again... Keep out of it. It's between Pancho and me. - If only you could take charge. - No, you're there for that. That's how it all started, remember? "Don't worry, love, I'll take charge". - It wasn't my fault. - It isn't your fault, mom. You do everything to help. Thank you, but I don't want your help anymore. Then... stop being useless. It's that song. That song is impossible. I sang it well. You know you remind me of him? - Of who? - Diego. How? I just see a resemblance. Imagine having a stutter. You want to say things, but you can't. How do you say that you feel like shit? Or... What if you want to tell someone you like them? That's why music was everything for him. It's Victor's birthday tomorrow. Can you make a cake for him? I can do that. But not with apples. Victor likes chocolate. I think I can do that too. It's Victor. I told him you were going to play for us. When? Now. You're very special for him. For who? It's a longtime since I was special for anyone. What's wrong with it? - Victor is just a kid. - And? He's at an age when he can get things confused. You never... You hear? You never let anyone get near me. It should have been enough that you fucked up my life once. Don't you think? Got any water? Your "Flame Red" has arrived. Thank you, Paquita. WOW! - At last! It was about time. - Wasn't it? A guy! - Diego? - Oh, God! - What's he saying? - It's something about his sister. He needs to know what happened to her. So Lupe can see him? Why can't I? I don't know. - I want to take a drug. - Paquita! - What? - You heard. I don't take drugs. Look, come here. Come! I have to take all this every day. So... Paquita... - Will you pay me? - Nadia. It wasn't for me. But if you help me, but if you help me, I will succeed. With sunglasses you think others can't see you. That's why lots of musicians wear them. Let's see. Shall we bring out the cake? Yeah? What did you forget? I love you. Don't be stupid. Your seatbelt! 15 years ago, your body was hurled against a windscreen like this. It took them two days to find your feet. You fucked up your sister's life, and your mother's. All because you didn't put on your goddamn belt! Hear that. But if I'm in luck... God! This song comes straight from Paradise! I have to sigh so hard that you can hear me from here. This is fucking great! Pancho is upstairs. Yes, he told me to wait for him. And, as well, I wanted to thank you, because... this birthday has been my best birthday ever. I'm glad. Lupe. I'm crazy about your mother. What about us? Us? I'm not a faggot. Neither am I! ...give you a kiss before I leave. I'm leaving... This house... It's full of ghosts! Pancho shouldn't have been born here. Lupe never said anything but I always knew it was yours. So... When she got pregnant, she didn't want to have it. I persuaded her. I persuaded her! I thought... that perhaps a bit of you would come back. All these years I've looked for something in Pancho, a gesture, something of you. But the two of you are completely different! Diego. I'm dying. How am I going to tell them? I can't. It seems leaving without saying goodbye is a sad family tradition. Nothing can keep me in this world anymore, not one minute. You and L on a trip around the sun, in a whole new dimension. What could be better than always being together, you and I? - Are you going to the rehearsal? - No. - They'll be expecting you. - I don't care. I know how you feel. I do know how he feels. Maybe I can help him. How? It's hard to say goodbye, but it's harder to leave without saying it. I... I can't go on playing with you, this is Greenland's last song, and it's for you. R hurts when you give others all that you'll never be able to give me. You never gave the world a chance to say goodbye, and for... How can that song help Pancho? It's about an impossible love. Why didn't you give it to me before? I didn't have time. Go to hell! Pancho didn't come to the rehearsal. We've come for him. The concert is tomorrow. Can you tell him to come down, please? Tell them to go away. This is the last song Diego wrote. No one has ever heard it. I want you to be the first. Look, you can do two things. Either one will be fine by me. You can... You can be like me, and shut yourself away in here, and miss out on your life. Or you can... Or you can keep facing up to everything, like you've always done. I promise that from now on everything will be better. What will be better? I will. Mom... What if I'm a fag? If you're a fag it's OK. I want us to sing a Greenland song. We haven't got time. No one's ever played it. And if we don't do it, no one ever will. Why have you changed your mind? - Because it goes. - With what? With us. Mom? What are you throwing out? Out of date samples. Mom's coming with me. Can I tell you something? Like a big brother who knows what he's talking about. Mom will be fine. Can I tell you something? Like a big sister. You were never part of this world. Any love would have disappointed you. That's why you chose me. But I am part of this world, I always was. It's just that... I had forgotten. This time I'd like to leave something. They'll be of more use to Pancho than to me. Come on. I can do it. Wait for me! Drive! Give me your sneakers. You want me to go barefoot? I've got something of Diego's for you. They helped me leave the house, and they'll help you with whatever you need. Madrid is so ugly. We're on. You're a special guy. It runs in the family. It's hard to say goodbye, but it's harder to leave without saying it. That's why someone wrote this song. Everything will be all right, mom. One, two, one, two, three and... ONE YEAH LATER My grandma died shortly after, on the day of the Christmas lottery draw. Her favorite day of the year. As mom says, now they're "dead". Hand me Diego. All except us. I'd been waiting so long to talk to you and since today you can hear me I'd like to tell you that everybody would like to have rock star parents because rock stars are a special kind of people... Like us.
