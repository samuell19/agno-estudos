How long has it been raining? Forever! Not forever... no For 100 years They say billions of people once lived on the earth and the temperatures rose the great cities fell and this rain came this terrible, toxic rain Our ancestors saw it coming a catastrophe They built ECOBAN the first living city genetically engineered to survive in a poisonous environment ECOBAN became our refuge Our salvation Survivors came by the thousands Begging to be let in but our ancestors turned them away Left them to die in the wasteland The ones who survived became our workers Mining the corbonite fields to feed our ECOBAN Diggers we call them The diggers need us... We need them Everybody wins But some win more than others Commander Lock The foreman says your putting the mens' safety at risk What? he's concenred that they're... Safety? What about thier quotas? They're behind as usual Damn it Now we'll have to lose this generator It's one headache after another with this old equipment Sir! You're going to have to shut everything down right now To save my men It's too late for that Jettison the deck! If... If you do that I'll order a mass strike I'm in no mood to negotiate Jettison it now! Over my dead body! Really? Alright then, If you so insist... Jay shoot him - That's not my job, sir - No? Do it now! When you file your official report, mention that he drew a knife Go back to ECOBAN, I'll clean this up You should have seen him Cade He had a smile on his face He enjoys killing them they're like insects to him Lock is getting more and more powerful every day There is no way to challenge his authority Just do your duty and stay out of his way Please be careful, you know I worry about you I know and I've always been able to take care of myself You should worry about the diggers, not me Our carbon reserves are dwindling... fast if ECOBAN dies someday Do you think that diggers will shed a single tear for us? They hate us Don't forget where your loyalties lie For now, let's just try to relax and enjoy the ECOBAN centennial Come on What's wrong with you? I'm tired that's all Go home and rest I'll come up as soon as I can slip away Cade here, go ahead We have an intruder alert sir - What? - Someone's hacking into the DELOS neuroplex Dispatch alpha patrol... now! I'm on my way System wide alert alpha patrol to the DELOS neuroplex We have a security breech in the control center What's he up to? Sir, he's hacked into the cube data - The DELOS file? - Yes sir Do not kill him I want this rat alive Run, try and run Alpha team, the intruder has left the DELOS neuroplex There he is! The target is heading east towards the basil canal Alpha team, move in We've lost him sir No sign of him down here Control room, stop the respiran This device is decades old Cabin alert in the cortex... I'm on my way Well well well, this rat's got wings Jay, report your position I'm in the Time-Capsule. I think he's here Send back-up Jay it's Cade, Are you alright? Acknowledge Jay, are you okay? Yes Did you get a good look at him? No I didn't, it happened too fast How could he have made it this far? Commander Cade promised us that our security was impenetrable, But tonite our air tight security was breeched by an intruder who materialized like a ghost and hacked our neural core It seems we do have a ghost on our hands only 1 man could have penetrated the DELOS system A man we all believed was dead Dr. Noah Yes We found his old entry codes on the device the intruder used to jam the respiran But after 10 years, why would he risk returning to ECOBAN? To shut down the DELOS neurogrid and achieve what he failed to accomplish 10 years ago A final energy release The old man said the bi-products of our refineries were killing the diggers sulpher in the air, mercury in the water He wanted to save them So he tried to release ECOBANS energy reserves and destroy the system he created When we shut down the flow mid release, He must have faked his death That explains why we never found his body all this time, he's been hiding with the diggers planning, preparing to destroy us But we must destroy him first He and the rebel army he has no doubt enlisted We must strike them down before they attack ECOBAN again Rebel army? There's no rebel army Dr. Noah sent in only one errand boy Today he got lucky that's all Rest assured we will find him and stop him before he makes his next move This I promise to each and every one of you We don't need promises What we need is Dr. Noah commander And you'll have him within 48 hours In the meantime, I implore you to make no move against the diggers They may hate ECOBAN, but we need them If they're not already planning a rebellion, Lets not give them a reason to do it Remember, they outnumber us 100 to 1 You want us to just sit around and simply wait for another attack We need to strike first, and strike hard or face the consequences We must not hesitate! Gentlemen, our carbon reserves are becoming dangerously low Step up security and find Dr. Noah Act quickly before it is too late That is all Lock Prepare your men just in case You can't follow simple instructions This would have been alot easier if you hadn't tripped the alarm Easier yes... but not half as much fun Go ahead, make jokes By now Lock has probably got half his troops scouring the wasteland for you well at least you got the data Toss it over here Shua Nice throw kid Well well , let's see what's new in that bohemoth of a city? What's this? The systems dying It's running at one tenth capacity Is it enough for an energy release? Perhaps What's gonna happen if you release all that power? We'll blast open the sky No, in ECOBAN. What will happen to all the people? Most will survive, but they won't have it easy they'll have to use solar energy and work shoulder to shoulder with the rest of us They'd kill us first What do you care what happens to them? Today, I saw someone I used to know Oh? Jay, she's all grown up and she's beautiful She's ECOBAN A girl? You're dead to them in ECOBAN So you better forget her Now find that kid brother of yours that orphan kid you take care of It's too dangerous for him in the city. Hanging around with those rejects. Those petty hoodlums He's ok, Let him pass Come on, pass it Zed! Hmmm.. hey you, cut that funeral crap! Play something with a pulse Don't smoke it all! Hey Woody, wanna drag? It's called tobacco Nah Woody Huh, Shua! Long time no see buddy Woody, let's go Hey Shua!

A bracelet Where did you get it from? A girl gave it to me Who is she? Your girlfriend? Professor Noah says the sky used to be blue 'sky blue' he said. That's what they called the colour My mom says there's a place where the sky is always blue! It's an island they call Gibraltar You wanna see something? What? It's stuck! This place is off limits - We should go back - Why? I'm scared Don't worry! I'll protect you Come on Jay, I'm gonna show you something You will remember it forever Now, open them Whoa! It's incredible How'd you know about this? Professor Noah said this would happen today In Gibraltar, people see this every day That's where I'm going You could come too, I guess That sky was so beautiful it blinded our eyes But it didn't last long It disappeared behind the clouds That was the last I ever saw of it And the last I saw of Shua In ECOBAN they're living like kings While we're dying in polluted slums They call us diggers and they treat us like dirt We want air we can breath, water we can drink Or the next thing we dig will be ECOBANS grave Sounds like another riots coming Better get out of here quick You scared? My brothers not scared Shua's not scared of anything at all Stop calling him your brother Shua was born in ECOBAN, he's one of them Such a big man, such a big talk Big talk? What'ya mean Moe? He's gonna find Gibraltar. Gibraltar! What is he crazy? It's a myth Forget that loser kid, and stick with me I'll teach you how to kick some ass Woody! Where you go...? - Woody! These damn riots are no good Bad for business, bad all around Isn't it worse to do nothing? Maybe. Then again maybe not. All depends on your philosophy Mine is stay alive Hey, how'd you get half a handcuff anyway? ECOBAN's security is coming! Woody, where did you go? You had me worried to death You don't just run into a riot. You could get yourself killed Look at that Stay here Woody...

Shua it's you isn't it? You shouldn't have come here Jay I thought that you were dead Shua The Shua you knew is dead We are enemies, we have to be Why? I don't think the diggers are my enemies So that's why you poison them? Because they are your friends Now when we get up there, you let me do the talking Cause I know how to handle him Fools! Go hide in there Don't worry about it, if he gives us the slightest bit of trouble I'll just kick his teeth in Oh hey, Shua! Good to see ya buddy What's goin on? Got a business proposition for ya...

There is no Gibraltar You wouldn't like it where I'm going Here All yours A gift But, your girlfriend gave it to you She's not my girlfriend Shua, promise me something? - Promise what? - Promise that you'll come back for me? We'll see each other again Oh Shua Jay found him and didn't report it? Yes, sir. Who is he? - That'll be all for now - Sir Mya, be sure to keep this to yourself Yes, sir Our target is Dr. Noah's accomplice. He's hiding in an abandoned tanker in the contaminated zone He's dangerous... shoot to kill Spread out Jay! It's clean, no one here! Sir no trace of him below! Why didn't you tell me? He's nothing more than a murderer Have you forgotten why he fled ECOBAN? That one! Look Where? Oh yeah, no problem Sorry we're late, traffic was a bitch Who the hell are you?

I said turn this thing around I got a red pass, a blue pass... Get out of the truck Who needs a pass now? Hit it! Now! Enough! Let them go We're gonna be so rich! Who gave you the authority to move weapons into the contaminated zone? We set a little trap Cade A successful trap that caught a few of Dr. Noah's rebellious vermin Let me remind you, I am still in command of this operation Or have you forgotten Lock Who is in command? Oh yes. You should really ask the governor about that The stolen transport is at the north bay docks Wipe them all out And that is not a suggestion. That's an order. Got it? What's all the ruckus down there? Sounds like a party It is. They ripped off an ECOBAN truck So why are you up here with a tired old man? Maybe I prefer your company You're thinking about that girl again Maybe I am, so what? Tomorrow after the energy release, none of that will matter anymore Will it? Don't be such a fatalist If you follow my instructions this time And activate the safety pod. You'll survive the blast You want to keep living don't you? Of course I want to live Well I'm glad to hear it That's the first sensible thing you've said in weeks But if it doesn't work I mean, if I don't... Look after Woody ok? You're coming back!

Woody? You can't see me You'll be alright How did you lose your sight? I was born this way, alot of us were Why Shua? Why'd you have to come back? I thought I'd finished you off You didn't finish anything, you just let me take the blame for you You were to blame. You took Jay outside ECOBAN, It was forbidden! Cade, you and I both know what happened that day. You grabbed the knife Enough! You killed the trooper You told them it was me Jay never learned the truth did she? She knows enough She know you want to destroy ECOBAN, that's all that matters Woody! Shua.... Woody! Jay move! Get out of the way! I thought I was taking care of him all this time, but I was wrong He was the one that was taking care of me I'm Sorry, Zed I'm going to ECOBAN Who wants to come? I appreciate it everyone Thanks Let's help Dr. Noah bring the place down For Zed Governor, with the diggers rioting, our refineries are at a standstill and our carbon reserves are rapidly being depleted ECOBAN's dying, if Dr. Noah's men strike, it won't survive an energy release Commander Cade has failed Now it's my turn My troops will smoke them out of thier hiding places And get rid if them once and for all This I promise You will never find them In fact, you don't even have to look Keep your troops exactly where they are There is no need to mobilze them at all Just wait Dr. Noah's men will be coming right to us, and this time we'll be ready for them They will not escape, and we will crush them I didn't expect you to come back We are both full of surprises aren't we?
