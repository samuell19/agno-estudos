Louis: They have driven me to this... driven me out of my homeland, into exile. (train whistle blows) Sit there, my boy. Next to papa. When the train starts, There’ll be things to see from the window. You think I wanted this? I never wanted it. I wanted to bring up my son in England, in a proper English home, to be a true and honest Englishman. But a true and honest Englishman I find... is a very rare bird indeed in this world we live in now. I have been lied to, cheated and betrayed by those I thought to be my friends. And by the one I loved most in all the world. Well, it is best to know where one stands, is it not? “Do not fear for our son, he will be well cared for, “far from the immoral influences “he was erstwhile subject to. “Do not attempt to follow me or find me. “Money will be sent to you at regular intervals. “If you wish to return to me, you know the conditions. “Pray for me as I pray for you. Your loving husband, Louis.” Mad. The man’s mad. We must find him. We must. Oh, very well, “must” – what can we do? We don’t have the least idea where he’s gone. Then we must find out where he’s gone. Mr. Stanbury helped us before, I’m sure he’d help us again. wouldn’t he, Nora? We don’t need help from that young man. Then what do you propose to do, papa? Are you telling us you are going to find Louis and bring him to his senses? Yes, well, let Mr. Stanbury find out what he can. He seems to have the knack of grubbing about in unsavory places with disreputable characters. But I don’t want to see him in my house. And I hope that’s clear. Martha: He’ll just be coming from the French’s house, I daresay, ma’am. It’s my belief he’ll never marry Camilla French. But he must marry her now, ma’am. She’s been buyin’ things all over Wells. I’m very glad he didn’t get his hands on Dorothy. Yes, ma’am. All right, Martha, I know what’s in your head – that it was no thanks to me she got away from him. And now she’s got away from us as well, ma’am. And I suppose that was my fault, was it? Not at all, ma’am. But I don’t think she should be blamed for liking Mr. Brooke. She had no business liking Mr. Brooke. No, ma’am. Martha. I think I shall get you to go over to Nuncombe-Putney. Do send Giles to Winslow’s and tell them to pick out a nice forequarter of lamb. Or it wouldn’t hurt you if you went and chose it yourself. Wouldn’t hurt me at all, ma’am. You get it a good size, take it to Numcombe in a basket, and give it to Miss Dorothy with my love. Miss Dorothy, mind – Make it clear it’s for her, not that contrary sister of hers. Nor yet her mother. Yes, ma’am. When I’ve given the lamb, am I to come away straight, or am I to say anything? You can... You can say that you know her old aunt... Wouldn’t... Wouldn’t refuse to have her back again. Yes, ma’am. (clears throat) Mr. Gibson, whatever is the matter? Shall I call Camilla? No. No. No, no, not that. Dear heavens, anything but that. Arabella – she is much recovered, and will be so pleased – No, it is you I have come to see, Mrs. French. And in private, if you please. Oh, then... do come in, Mr. Gibson. I can’t do it, Mrs. French. I can’t go through with it. Oh. Poor Camilla. I know I am to blame, but she’s so very – I had no idea a young lady could be so – I own it to you, Mrs. French, I’m terrified of her. Oh, I’m sure when she’s calmed down with matrimony she’ll be as humble and grateful as you could wish. She isn’t as bad as she seems. She’s been very severe with me. Don’t you understand? It is too late for turning back. I am willing to submit to any verdict you may pronounce against me, but I can’t go through with it. If the sky should fall on me, I cannot – I cannot stand at the hymeneal altar with a lie in my mouth. Even so, Mr. Gibson. I’ll do anything you say – except marry Camilla. Oh... I think I understand. Do you, Mrs. French? The truth is that, after all, you have always liked Bella best. Ah. Yes, of course. That is the truth, isn’t it? Mrs. French, I own that it is. You know me too well. What are you doing? Nothing. Who is in there? No one. That is, Mr. Gibson is in there with mama. What’s he want mama for? I don’t know, but she said most particularly that they were not to be disturbed. Ah, Camilla. Um, how unfortunate. I have to leave immediately. Thomas – I’ll write you a letter. Write me a letter? Why should he write me a letter when he can see me as easy as winking? Bella, I wonder whether you’re a serpent after all. Serpent? I declare, Cammie, you do say such odd things. Morning, Martha. Beautiful day. (knocking) Martha! Come in. Sit down, Martha. Did you carry that all the way from the station? Yes, Miss Priscilla. And did you see anybody just now? Yes, Miss Dorothy. Mr. Brooke Burgess. And what did he say to you? Not much, miss. Well... I’m engaged to be married to Mr. Brooke. Oh, miss! She won’t like it. Oh, Martha, she may not. But he tore up my letter and came down here and wouldn’t take no for an answer. And what business is it of hers, I’d like to know. No, Priscilla. We must try to win her around. How is she, Martha? Is she well and strong again? Sir Peter says she’s getting well. She eats and drinks again? Pretty well. But not as it used to be, you know, miss. Sir Peter wanted her to go Dawlish for the air, but she won’t go. She said if she couldn’t live at Wells, she would die there. She’s not... She’s not careful to live, miss. Would she – No, don’t say it. Would she better if I were to come and see her? I know she would, miss. Then I’ll come back with you today, Martha. But I shall have to tell her about Mr. Brooke, and she will have to bear it as best she can. Is Mr. Bozzle at home? No, he’s not, sir. Who shall I say was asking? Mr. Stanbury, Mr. Trevelyan’s friend. Bozzle: Bring the gentleman in, Susan. Bozzle will receive him. (baby fussing) Excuse my intrusion, Mr. Bozzle. Not at all, sir. You’ll be wanting to know the whereabouts of your friend, I daresay, sir. That’s it, Mr. Bozzle. Well, sir, he’s gone. And as to where, Bozzle is sworn to secrecy. Absolutely and totally sworn to secrecy? Well, I’ll be straight with you, sir. I’m worried about the gentleman. He’s – how shall I put it – not quite himself, sir. He needs looking after. And so does that child. I think we all want what’s best for him. That’s right, sir, we do. We have to ask ourselves how can be best exercise our duty toward Mr. Trevelyan. That’s it, sir – when he don’t know himself what’s best for him. Exactly. Poste restante, Florence. That’s all the address I have for him, but I daresay that’ll lead you to him. All right, Mr. Bozzle. I think I’ve done my best, sir. I think my conscience is clear. I’m sure it is. Thank you, Mr. Stanbury. You’ve been most helpful. Only too happy to help. May I ask what your plans are now? We shall travel to Italy as soon as possible and see what we can do to recover little Louis. I’d be glad to come with you and help in any way I can. That’s very kind of you, but we really mustn’t trouble you any further. As your daughter’s fiancé, I’m happy to be at her side. You are not my daughter’s fiance, Mr. Stanbury. I do not approve of that engagement. Nor do I recognize it. I thought that had been made perfectly clear to you. I should like to have your blessing for the marriage, sir, but we can do without it. Your daughter is of age, she could walk out of the house with me today with nothing but the clothes she stands up in, and we could be married and live happily ever after. Nora? I will come to Italy with you, papa, to be with Emily and help her recover little Louis. But I won’t give up my engagement to Mr. Stanbury. I have promised him, and I will keep my promise. Even though you don’t approve. You’ll do nothing of the kind, Nora. You’ll be coming back with your mother and me to the Mandarin Islands. No! You would never treat me like that, papa. Well, how are you proposing to treat your mother and me? Very well, papa, but you wouldn’t want me to marry a man who couldn’t make me happy. I love Hugh, and I shall be true to him. Not if I have anything to do with it. Now, look, here, Mr. Stanbury – I’m sure you’re an excellent fellow, according to your lights, but forget about my daughter and find someone else to marry. It’s too late for that, sir. No one else will do for me. So I’ll wait for Nora, sir, if she’ll wait for me. Lady Rowley. Mrs. Trevelyan, I wish you success on your quest. And I wish you a change of heart and a change of mind, Sir Marmaduke. Good afternoon. (carriage approaches) Here she is, ma’am. My child. My dearest child. I thought it might be so. Jane, another tea cup and saucer. And get a hot cake, Jane. You will be ever so hungry, my darling, after your journey. I didn’t stay to eat any of the lamb. You shall have a calf instead, my dear. Because you are a prodigal returned. But what is the meaning of that little bag? Where are the rest of your things? I though I might stay just the one night, aunt. Stuff and nonsense! Now, you come and tell me all your news. And so you have all got on very well together and not thought about your old aunt one bit. Of course I have, and here I am to prove it. And very well you look here. I’ve gotten somehow to love your pretty face, Dolly. And I find I don’t care for my house as I used to when you’re not in it. Dear aunt. There’s something else I have to tell you. Does it concern Mr. Brooke Burgess? Yes, it does. Then I don’t want to hear it. He’ll be here in a day or two, and he will tell you himself if you don’t let me tell you now. He needn’t trouble himself to come here. Don’t say that. I do say it. When I said that I should be glad to see you, I didn’t intend that you should meet Mr. Burgess under my roof. He knows the way from Nuncombe to London without stopping at Wells. Aunt Stanbury, you must let me tell it all. I know what it is you want to tell me. And I don’t want to hear it. Why should it be so very bad if Brooke and I were to be married? Because you are a Stanbury. And he is a Burgess. That’s why. I’m a rich old woman, Dolly, and I’m going to die very soon. All my money came to me from the Burgess family. It was left to me when I least expected it by a man I once loved who died too young. It’s made bad feelings between the families. And I’ve – I’ve never felt right about it. And I’ve always said that when I die it should go back to the Burgess family. And they know that, and they expect it. That’s why I made Brooke Burgess my heir. I’ve lived very carefully, Dorothy, I’ve never spent a penny of their capital, they shall have it all back. Every bit of it. But....I – I don’t see why that should stop Brooke marrying me if he wants to. Because they will say it was all a trick to keep the money with the Stanburys. They’ll say I only left it to Brooke so that you should have it. And I won’t have them saying that. Brooke says he doesn’t mind about the money. Brooke should mind about the money. I mind about the money. If you and Brooke Burgess get married, I will have to give you both up. And... what good will that do? I don’t want to have to give you up, Dolly. You’ve become very dear to me. You’re dearer to me than he is. Don’t make me give you up, Dolly. If you feel so badly about it, aunt, I cannot bear to hurt you. I will let him go. Though I shall love him always. I never expected anyone would want to marry me. (sniffling) But it is very hard... when somebody so very dear wants you for his wife, and... I cannot have him. I was never unhappy before. I never expected any more than I had, and I was quite contented. But now I wish... I wish I’d never met him. (crying) (door opens) Dorothy? Are you awake? Can you speak to me? Is something the matter, aunt? Inly the vagaries of an old woman, my pet. It isn’t morning, is it? No. You can go back to sleep very soon. Dolly, I have thought about it, and you shall be Brooke’s wife. And we will have it here, and we will all be friends. What? You will like that, will you not? I don’t know what I’ve been thinking of. Why should I care what people say of me when I am gone, so long as you are happy? I’m not dreaming, am I? No, you’re not dreaming, my pet. You go back to sleep now. And you can tell him yourself tomorrow how it will be. And you must say to him that if he is not good to my girl and love her always and keep her from harm, I will hold him to be the most ungrateful of human beings. There. Marmaduke: Well, well... Over the alps in pursuit of a madman. Fine way for a man of middle years to spend his holidays. It’s very good of you, Marmaduke. You’ve been such a good father to your girls. Look how they repay me. One marries a lunatic, the other turns down a peer of the realm for the sake of a journalist. As to that, I wonder if there’s something yet to be done. I understand that Mr. Glascock is still in Italy. His poor father is at death’s door. Very sad, but how should that concern us? Nora, Marmaduke. When he sees her again, who knows? Ah...well... We may hope. Both: Hello! Good God. For heaven’s sake, girls, take care! Look like a couple of mountain goats. We brought them up to be brave and independent and to follow their own hearts. Did we? Can’t recall that being my intention. Well, however it came about, that’s the case. And now we are living with the consequences. And so are they. “I sit down, Camilla, with a sad heart “and a reluctant hand to – “to communicate to you a fatal truth...” (knocking) Miss French, I’m ever so sorry, but – What is the meaning of this, Thomas? Take it back! Take it all back this minute! Camilla, I cannot. It would be wrong. Wrong?! What was wrong was to write it, you cowardly beast! I deserve all your censure. I submit to it willingly. You call yourself a Christian! What heathen ever behaved worse?! You have trifled with my affections, with my love, a maiden’s first and only love! Wait ’til the world hears of this, you sniveling coward! Your minister’s gown shall be torn off your back! And the very boys of Wells shall drag you through the gutters! I – I’m ready to bear all the consequences, but – but – I cannot go through with the marriage. Then tell me this, sir – is there anything between you and Bella? Because if there is, let her beware. I’d stab her through the heart rather than see you and she as man and wife. Do you hear me? Stab her through the heart! And you, as well! You... poor, paltry, lying, cowardly creature! You see if I don’t! (indistinct conversation) Did you ask if he’s here, Marmaduke? Trevelyan? I thought he was supposed to be in hiding. No, of course not, Mr. Trevelyan – Mr. Glascock. Oh, Glascock. No, I didn’t think to ask. Why should I? Hardly know the man. These people look a pretty rum bunch. I shouldn’t be surprised if some of them were Americans. Well, this is the American embassy, Marmaduke. I suppose one has to make the best of things in a place like Florence. Miss Rowley. How are you? What an unexpected pleasure. Is it truly? A pleasure, I mean. A great one. We can always be friends, I hope. Of course we can. Mama. Papa. This is Mr. Glascock. Very happy to make your acquaintance. Our girls have spoken of you so warmly. How is Mrs. Trevelyan? As well as can be expected. Her husband has brought her child here. I wonder if you’ve heard or seen anything of him? Both, Lady Rowley. I saw him a few days ago here in Florence. He spoke of taking up residence somewhere near Siena. Somewhere quiet, away from people. And how is he looking, Mr. Glascock? Very ill. Very ill, indeed. I think he takes no care of himself at all. But he’s devoted to the little boy. If there’s any way in which I can help you, please don’t hesitate to ask. Anything at all. Thank you, Mr. Glascock. I think I understand you. Isn’t that Mr. Etherington? Would you excuse us, Mr. Glascock? Marmaduke. Oh. (clears throat) Have you met the Miss Spaldings? Let me introduce you. Miss Caroline Spalding, Miss Olivia Spalding, Miss Nora Rowley. Miss Rowley! What a pleasure. Mr. Glascock has spoken of you often. Yes, we – we were acquainted in London. A little more than that I should have thought from the way he talks about you. Mr. Glascock is a little inclined to be enthusiastic. Not about that many things. The Duomo and the Uffizi don’t impress him much. That’s just his English upper class philistinism. Quite right. Rachel! I see you know Mr. Glascock very well. Caroline and I are engaged to be married. He asked me this very afternoon. He told me all about you – you’re not annoyed with us, are you? No! I’m very happy for you both. Mama! Papa. This is Miss Caroline Spalding, Mr. Glascock’s fiance. Oh. Oh, how do you do? We’re delighted to make your acquaintance. Likewise, I’m sure. “I know, Mrs. French, that I have no right to complain, “but I cannot bear any more of this. “If your younger daughter “forces herself into my house again, I shall leave the town and never come back.” You must not go there again, Camilla. I shall go there whenever I please. If you continue in this way, I shall have to send for your Uncle Crump from Gloucester. What do I care for my uncle? He would take my part. He would not. The truth is, you interfered with Bella first, and these are the consequences. And you mean to say she is to be Mrs. Gibson and have all my fine new things? I will die first. Your dying has nothing to do with it, Camilla. And I will kill her. Molly says that Camilla has taken a carving knife from the kitchen and hidden it in her chest of drawers. That does it! I shall send for your Uncle Crump at once! (speaking Italian) What’s he saying? We have to walk the rest of the way. Dear God, what a country. You stay here, papa. Mr. Glascock and I will go. No, you must stay here, Mrs. Trevelyan. We don’t know what state we may find him in. He may be violent. He won’t be violent to me. In any case, as a precaution. I’ll come down and fetch you if he seems... conversable. Please? I insist. Very well. Sir. I don’t believe there’s a soul here. We’ll not give up until we’ve seen it all, at any rate. Here’s something, sir. Hello? Trevelyan, are you there? Shall we go in? I think we should. Trevelyan? Is anyone here? Buongiorno. Trevelyan. Sir Marmaduke and I have come to visit you. I’m sorry... that you should have troubled yourselves to come here. But I do not want visitors... and I have nothing to offer you. Emily is here. You’ve brought her? I’ve come here to be free of her. Let her go back home. She wants her child, Trevelyan. She has forfeited... her right to him by deceiving me with that man. What sort of pernicious mad talk is that? Deceived you? My daughter is incapable of deceit. Don’t you see what you’ve done, man? You’ve broken her heart. You understand nothing, sir. It is she who has broken mine. Of course you defend her. She is your daughter. But you understand nothing. You had better go away, Sir Marmaduke. You can do no good by coming here. I loved that woman more than my life, and she betrayed me. I would have given the world to save her, but she would not be saved. You’re a damned liar, sir. Trevelyan... won’t you let us see her boy, just for a little while? She’s come all this way just for a few minutes with her son. She wants to see you, too. She still cares for you, in spite of everything. Does she? I wish I could believe that. Very well. Let her come. But let her come alone. Not that man – he is not to come here again. Or you, sir, though I mean you no harm. But you have nothing to do with this dreadful business. Let her come alone. You will be gentle with her? I could never be otherwise than gentle with her. Go down to her now. Ask her to give me a little while to prepare myself to receive her properly. Un momento, signora. Oh, Louis. Don’t you know me? Good boy. I’m so thankful to you for bringing him to me. Perhaps it might have been better to have sent him with a servant. But I don’t like to let him out of my sight, you see. Louis... Did you think I didn’t want to see you, too? Louis? Louis, speak to me. It is hard to speak sometimes. You still love me, don’t you? Yes, I love you. But I’m afraid of you. Afraid of me. What have you to fear? That you’ll take my child from me, of course. Have the lawyers and the doctors declare me mad. Throw me into some madhouse. Rob me of my liberty. Rob me of my power as a man. I don’t want any of those things. I want us to be together, with little Louis. Come, let us sit down together. I want you to come back with me to England. Have you tricked me, Emily? Are there policemen waiting outside ready to snatch the boy and carry me away to prison? No, Louis. No! No. There’s only me. And papa and Mr. Glascock. We want you to come home with us and be well again. Truly. You have been here long enough. Louis must go back to his own room now. Emily. Don’t reward my courtesy with disobedience. Maria! You go with Maria now, my boy. Mama will come and see you again. You will let me come again? You think I don’t care for him? No mother was ever more tender with her child than I am with him. I believe you. But he needs his mother, too. We should be together, Louis. Who knows that better than I? Now, then, so, this is the way it is. He has to marry one of you, or we take him to court and make him pay for it. I, um – as I understand it, he’s willing to marry young Bella there. No! There’s no “no” about it, young lady. That’s how it is and you must learn to put up with it. I shan’t put up with anything of the sort. Uncle: Just leave the two of us alone for a few minutes, if you would. We’ll soon sort things out. Now, look here. This man can never be made to marry you, anyhow. I wouldn’t touch him with a pair of tongs if he were kneeling at my feet. That’s right, my dear. You stick to that. In the meantime, he wants to marry someone else. That can’t hurt you, now, can it? He may marry who he likes. But he shan’t marry Bella, that’s all. Well, now, that’s just what he is going to do. Never. Never. Jilt me and marry her? Could you bear it? I am not a young woman. Now I’ll tell you what you’re going to do. I won’t do anything. You’ll pack your things and come back with me to Gloucester today. I won’t. Then you will be carried, my dear. I won’t. Don’t touch me! I’ll stab you through the heart! And her and him, and then myself! And then you’ll all be sorry. That’s a great deal of stabbing, my dear. You’d best get on with it, hmm? Come on, then! (knife drops to floor) There, now. That’s better. All over now. And we’ll be as jolly as can be when we get you home to Gloucester. You do love me, Thomas? Yes...I love you. I have had a great deal to go through, Bella. And so have you. But God will temper the wind to the shorn lambs. Come, let’s go inside. Louis, my boy... would you like to go back to mama? Would it be nice to go back to mama? Then you shall go to her. I’ll write to her and she’ll come and fetch you. And then papa will have nothing. Who would have thought it? Excellent. If he’d only made his mind up to it the other day we’d have saved ourselves a deal of trouble, but never mind. We go back to that benighted spot tomorrow morning. First thing, before he changes his mind. Get the boy from him, and then back home to the dear old Mandarins. No, papa. No? Wasn’t this the whole purpose of coming over the Alps? Yes, but now I’ve seen him. And he’s so weak and ill. And friendless. I think he means to let himself die, papa. Alone in a foreign country. He’s still my husband, whatever he’s done. And I love him still. I think as much as I ever did. But, dear, what then do you propose to do? I can’t leave him here. The man who took us to him told us the villagers don’t want him there. They say he’s mad, and they want him committed to a place of safety. Excellent idea. No. Imagine what it would be like for him. I want to bring him back to England. With little Louis. Or, if he refuses to come, I shall stay with him here, if he will let me, and look after him. Ridiculous. I will stay with you, Emily, and help you bring him back. Maid: Scusare. Is Signor Stanbury. Nora. Emily. I came as soon as I could. Forgive the intrusion, but Emily’s written to me about poor Louis, and as his oldest friend – I should have come before. We’ll bring him home to England. That’s what he needs, whether he knows it or not. He needs his wife and his child and his friends around him. And I think we should set about it as soon as possible. You take a good deal upon yourself. No more than I should, sir. These are the people I care about most in the world. Mr. Stanbury, we are very grateful for your help. Stanbury. It is good of you to come and see me. No hard feelings, then? I believe you always meant well. Could you pour me a glass of wine, Emily? (pouring wine) You see me very poorly, Stanbury. I barely eat at all now, but I can drink, as you see. You want a change of climate, old fellow. A change of everything. If I could have a new body and a new soul. Oh, Louis, your soul will do well enough if you will let us look after the body. (coughing) Listen, old friend, we have to get you back to England. It isn’t safe for you here. This is my home now. I’m as safe here as anywhere. Louis... dear Louis, you’re wrong. The local people say you are mad. They want to take you away from here and have you locked up in a place of safety. I don’t believe you. It’s true, Louis. Maria. Come here, Maria. Do you think I’m mad, Maria? Do you want to see me locked up in a dark place? No, signora. But...others do? Thank you, Maria. I do no harm here. Why won’t they let me die here in peace? Don’t say that. You can be well again. Don’t you remember, Louis, just a year or so ago the four of us together? You said I was the happiest man you knew. You can be happy again. You have a wife who loves you, you have a fine son, you have friends who care for you. I have enemies, too. Who? Colonel Osborne? That vain, stupid old man? No one here cares tuppence for him, least of all Emily. Osborne will go to his grave lonely and unloved. He’ll never know what you’ve known. I wish I could believe you, Stanbury. Louis... let me take you home and look after you. Don’t turn me away. I thought I could make you happy, Emily. I thought I could be... Enough for you. You have made me happy. You’ll make me happy again if you let me make you well. Too late for that, I think. No, don’t say that. You’re my dear love. You’ll be well again, you’ll see. Say you’ll come home with me. Very well. Thank you so much, Hugh. How do you think he looks now? Well, I – I know. I hoped he was getting stronger. I’m sure he’s better for being back in England and at home with you. Yes. He does seem more peaceful. He’s dying, Hugh. He wants to die. And... Oh, Hugh, he still believes he was right. I better get back to him. I’ll come again soon. Yes, do. No, no, that one should be marked “Not wanted on the voyage.” Where’s Nora? Nora, are your trunks packed and ready to be brought down? Papa, I’ve told you. I’m not going back to the Mandarins with you. I’m going to stay and marry Hugh. So, you’d defy me to the end, would you? Marmaduke. It doesn’t have to be a matter of defiance. What else is it when a man can’t expect obedience from his own daughter? You could reconsider, Marmaduke. Oh, think, my dear. What future would there be for Nora in the Islands? And Mr. Stanbury has proved to be a remarkably able young man. And constant. Yes, that’s all very well. Helpful. Unselfish. A good friend. Yes, yes, yes. All right. And I believe that journalism is coming to be regarded as quite a respectable occupation for gentlemen nowadays. D’you know, Marmaduke, I see in Mr. Stanbury many of the qualities I saw in you as a young man. Do you indeed? But the thing’s impossible. They haven’t a penny apiece between them, and I can’t give her anything. We can get by on what he earns, papa. And he has prospects. He expects to be earning £600 a year soon. You can’t live the life of a gentleman on 600 a year. Please, father. If you love me. He said yes! Well, good for him. We must never quarrel. Or if we do, we must make up immediately. In the best way. Agreed. Emily? Dearest Louis. Say you forgive me. Yes. Yes...I forgive you. And you love me. I’ve always loved you. And can you say one more word to me? What word? That you believe me now. That you believe I was never unfaithful to you. I never betrayed you. Louis? Louis, you needn’t say it. Kiss my hand, Louis... if you believe me. (church bells ringing) Good morning, sir. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Morning.
