I have to tell you something. It's actually from my diary called Emilia's Super Fantastic Diary. And you really shouldn't tell your diary stuff to anyone, but since I'm Emilia, I guess I can tell you this. It all happened near my home, the cove, and the butter factory, and the school and Simon's house. It was really strange and scary. As a story at midnight, it was totally dark and glum. My mom always says I shouldn't be too, what's that word? Negative. But sometimes, I just have to be a bit negative. It all started when our biology teacher went fishing at midnight. During the day, he's at school with us. So he has to fish at night. - Hullaballoo. - Hullaballoo. - Let's go get him. - Let's go get him. C'mon, c'mon, hush, hush. Hey, what, what, what is happening? What, hey, hey. What, hey, hey, hey, hey, help, help, help. What? Help. Well hello, did you run away again? Actually, it all started when this pet store opened near us. They used to sell house plants. I'm not interested in house plants. Or maybe I would be, if I was a plant, like a cactus. But animals are a different story. I always stopped by the window and I passed by it very often as it's on my way to... Oh no, school! Not again! Thanks. See you guys. Oh, hey little guy. Hey, hey, you two boys! Stop there, stop what you're doing! It's your principal speaking, the prince, yeehaw! And a few pieces of information. When washing your hands, remember, one piece of paper per hand. I mean, two pieces of paper per hand. No, one piece of paper per pair of hands. Yeehaw! Oh and health alert, be aware, pin worms, diarrhea and parasites, so wash your hands and no rubbing heads together. We have lice. Yahoo, yeehaw! Morning Simon. You're not the only one that's late. Hey there, you guys remembered to wipe your filthy feet outside, right? Yeah. Good. Seaweed for Simon. Like your breakfast? Open up wide, baby. This isn't seaweed, it's clover. Today we'll discuss the old enemies of our waters. Any guesses? What could that be? What bacteria could it be? Not the yellow bacteria, not the magenta. Come on kids, you need to participate. Success in life. Simon is my best friend. A lot of kids think he's strange but his dad is the strange one. He has a seaweed stand on the beach. Simon often has seaweed as a snack because it's healthy. Greasy Antero bullies him. Every morning, Greasy Antero styles his hair with butter. They have a lot of it, as his dad owns the butter factory. And everyday, he bullies Simon. Who knows the answer? The clock is ticking. And the correct answer is Cyanobacteria, yes, and where do we have it? Yes, in the Baltic Sea and what does it cause? Good, eutrophication and what does it kill? The organisms. Boy, I'm on a roll today. What are you doing Simon? And what causes the pollution then? You're idiots. Idiots, that's correct. Idiots pollute the ocean. Well done Simon, our weed and algae specialist. But pick up the pencils you dropped. Yes, let's keep this classroom and the nature clean. Dad and I were thinking of buying a telescope. But not a big one, it's not practical. It would be too heavy when traveling. What're you looking at? Isn't it cute? Bye. Bye. Look at what Kiersha shared with everyone. Greasy got a pool for his birthday. Cool, right? Pool slides are great. Yeah, I always go on them. My dad can't even handle a small slide though. What's that noise? I don't know, it only used to stink, now there's that noise. Hi there, I made this basic weed and moss based porridge. There you go. If you want to make it more meaty, sprinkle some animal plankton on top. Oh, Emilia, are you hungry? We've got dessert as well. You can make a nice jam from a jellyfish. Take a look. Oh, don't worry. It's not from this cove, have to clean it seaweed elsewhere. Don't know how long I can keep this stand open, the trees are grain. Here you go. Sorry, but I'm not really hungry and my moms waiting for me. Emilia! Hey mom! Emilia, I've got a surprise for you! Simon, come along with us. What kind of fur ball do you want? Seriously mom? I get one finally? Yes sweetie. - You finally get one. - Yes! Hey, hey, be careful, okay. Some animals have been on the run. They can get a little tricky sometimes. A rare beetle is still missing. Choose carefully. I know mom, I know. A guinea pig? Kind of boring. But I've always wanted a guinea pig. Let's look at the other critters as well. Like a fish. Aw, aw. You're so cute. Ow, hey, why did you do that? - Hey mom, this guinea pi... - Don't tell her. If you tell her it bit you, she won't buy it for you. You won't get it. Emilia, what about the guinea pig? This guinea pig is so cute. I'll give you a discount since this is a strange one. Keeps it's own company, doesn't like baths, walks it's own path. Perfect, yes, we'll take it. Come to the register. What does a fur ball like that need? Food, cage, some love and affection. You have some kind of preferred customer card or rewards points? Gold, silver, copperton? Just the debit card. I hope you find your beetle. We always find them somewhere. They're always crawling around somewhere, I just... It's just crisp bread for the bunnies. You're gonna need a water bottle too. Guinea pigs can't run in wheels. But this little guy can do anything. What about fluffy? Butterball? Pumpkin? How about Pavarotti? Is it a boy or a girl? - Mom? - Hm? - Is this a boy or a girl? - Oh, I forgot to ask. Don't know. It has to be a really cute name. Anita Hirvonen? There's no telling with these things. Duster? Hey look. I think it's a sign, maybe it wants to be Halonen. Or, Tarja, the pig. Guinea pig Halonen. It's guinea pig Halonen. Well I gotta go home now. Bye Simon. I got the world's cutest guinea pig today. Her eyes look like two giant balls. She has lovely little bug teeth. Snacks are ready in the kitchen. I'll be right down. She's like one fluffy ball, all rolled in and... Come on, kiddo. The sandwiches are getting cold. Okay, I'm coming. Mom's boyfriend Pertti gets on my nerves. Why are sandwiches so important? Why does he eat all the time? All right Em, mom's waiting. Let's get moving. Dad, what're you doing here? Came to eat, okay? And say hi to you. Not a moments peace here. But it's nice that dad comes over to see us for dinner. Mom and dad got divorced when I was eight. They're friends, even though dad has a new home. It's peaceful at dads but boring because he's been writing his book for five years now. He just writes and writes and writes. I like living her with mom and Pertti. No peace here but it's cleaner and it smells nicer. I see Pertti has his brewery going again. At the resort next week, you'll get the best beer this side of the Baltic. How was your summer vacation? Vacation? That's funny, I wish I could go away for even a weekend. A few days at the spa. What happened to your finger? Uh, no. The guinea pig, her cage, I got scratched. Oh no, they might have to chop off your finger. Well it needs to be disinfected. Well, I better get going. Bye sweetie. Bye dad. Mom is a nurse and she knows about these things. Ah, this Uber's expensive. She always has a first aid kit. You never know if a guinea pig will bite. But mom's boyfriend Pertti, he's not exactly a genius. He eats all the time. He's from Turku and thinks that you don't get fat. Well, her business, not mine. Goodnight little one. Hello, wakey wakey, anybody home? Who's there? It's me. What? Can I get a double cheeseburger with an order of fries and a milkshake? Nah, it was a joke. Guinea pig humor, you know? Hop in. C'mon get in. I don't think so, go away. I know you're not real, I'm dreaming. Yep, it's a dream. Come on now and put on a sweater. It's chilly out here. Well it's just a dream. There's a situation in Norway, a stuck in a drain, code seven six one. Sorry dispatch, I'm in the middle of a two four five. Roger that. We got a cow stuck in a house in Mexico. He can't get out the doors or the windows. Hey, take it easy. I'm gonna wake up. Aren't we a nervous one? Two seven four, ETA Mexico, two hours 30 minutes. Actually more like, say, two and 40, I gotta go grab grub first. Over and out. Hey you, where are we going? What did you say? Where are we going? Going to Lotti. Why Lotti? Tell me about it, I wanted to go to the ski resort in Germany. Two seven four, how the weather looking up there? We got some snow coming down. Hey back seat, turbulence ahead. We got another case of a puffin stuck in Iceland. Two seven four, free tomorrow. Over and out. Alrighty, roger that. Over and out. You already said that. Oh, sorry. Over and out. You don't have to, you already said it. Okay, nevermind. Over and out. Why are we here? You'll soon see. Okay little missy, this is your exit. Help me. Hello Emilia, it was quite a ride. You did well on that slope. Could've stuck the landing a bit better. What? Ah, wait. I'll upload this to the net. Longest selfie stick in all of Finland. Who are you? What are you? I'm the guinea pig, the giant guinea pig, you know. Open your mouth, come on. Ah. How does that feel? How does what feel? I'm guessing a guinea pig bit your finger today, right? Yeah. It was a sign, you know. What is this? You've been chosen to be super fur ball, quite an honor, you know? Who exactly chose me? Aw, the guinea pigs, not me, but the little ones. I just handle the PR and supervise the actions of the super fur balls. Every time you take a sip from the guinea pig Halonen's bottle, you turn into super fur ball. So cool! Yeah, super powers. Hey, can I kick Greasy's butt? No, you can't abuse your powers. You cannot abuse your powers. Your mission is more important than you think. A school of herrings are riding in the cove, breaking everything. You have to calm down the herrings. Hm, cool, you're beginning to get into your guinea pig groove now. Ah, horrible teeth. Hey, Mr. Halonen, I had the strangest dream last night. I see you have baseball today. That's fun, right? It sucks. Take your water bottle with you. It's, how do you kids say? Tots hots. Nobody says that mom. Uh, seriously. I look fine. I look fine. Don't forget the water bottle. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Bye! Bye bye. Tots bad. Where is it? Ugh. Ugh. Where is my shoe? Today we're gonna be playing baseball or as I like to call it, crazy ball. We're gonna stick to the basics and have some fun. I hate baseball. It's the most boring sport ever. The PE teacher is so crazy about sports. She eats a ton of cottage cheese. Today the teams will be selected by Antoro. It's dangerous to eat that much cottage cheese. And Emilia. Well gee wiz. Let's go. Okay, the best ones here with me, lose with Emilia. Done. One at a time Anturo. Emilia, go ahead. Kisika. I'll take Peter, or better known as Farty. I like to have Simon on my team but he always strikes out. Why do I have to choose the teams? I don't want to. If I choose him, we'll lose and everyone will blame me. Leslie. Of course she'll take Simon, they're dating. Aw, cute couple. No we're not. Simon, Emilia's team wants you. I'll take the dog. Hey, hey, I don't want Simon. Let's pick new teams. Yeah, we don't want Simon. All he does is strike out. This is really horrible. Strike three. Thanks four eyes. You missed 15. Such a lame loser. Yo loser. Oh boy, this is never gonna end. This is it, kids, the last inning. Simon, go to the out field and stay out of the way, 'kay? Go as far as you can. Simon, catch it. Next batter. Mikey, step up. Emilia, you're next. Second out. Only the second? Help. Do I have to? All right, let's get a move on. I'm not missing lunch today. If you miss, you'll lose. Sorry, when you miss, you'll lose. Hey, I need to ask you something. What happened to your face? Quit talking and play some ball. Oh boy, this is really exciting. The last and final strike and then we can get a move on to that chicken casserole. Come on kids, let's get it moving. You'll lose even though we had Simon on our team. Like, yay. That's a foul, that's clearly a foul ball. That's right, Emilia's last hit was a foul ball. It was the third and last out of Emilia's team. Chicken casserole, this way, please. That was some hit, very interesting. Yeah, where did the ball go? It's from the elementary school. Ugh, the sound barrier broke some windows. Here too? All over the school and we're over the budget. Come in kitchen, Prince one calling. Cancel the meatballs tomorrow, just mashed potatoes. Ricky, potatoes only. Simon, do superpowers exist? No, why are you asking? I can't really tell you. Hi. Hi. Listen, I gotta ask you something. We've all been wondering. Are you two together? What do you mean, us two? Well, you and Simon. No way. Poor Simon, everyone thinks he's a freak. I heard that all he eats at home is seaweed. Can you imagine? I guess he's kind of, kind of, different. Bye. Bye. We're not sure - Hey. About the situation at the cove. Hi babe. Hey. Coming in overnight - but we do know. - Hi there boo boo. Property has been damaged and several boats have been vandalized and released from their anchors. Hey, Simon's dad is on - the news. - We have one more standing by. Sir, can you let us know what's happening today? No vandalism before but only the butter factory polluting the algae, reeds and other vegetable goodies from the sea. Horsetail and salt marsh have disappeared, well, all together. The police have no clues of the perpetrators. Those punks should be sent to juvenile hall. You don't know that, they could be adults as well. Why would an adult do something so stupid? Why would an adult wear a bib? Well, cleanliness matters, dear. The situation is underlined by an explosion beneath the surface. The police are investigating however, Meteorological Institute explained. Someone just hit a baseball into the water. Up next, financial news. Super fur ball. It's super fur ball. No going. Are you deaf? Wait up super fur ball. Super fur ball. Wait. I'm so tired. Down here,. I know you're the super fur ball. What are you? What am I? Blazing Belinis. You talk? Yes, though they keep saying herrings are a quiet bunch. Is this kind of a joke? Niet. We need your help, super fur ball. You know this cove near here in the Baltic Sea, yeah? Yes of course. It was on the news. The young herrings are so mad. Soon something terrible will happen. Is it you herrings that are making the mess? Oh look, she's talking to her friends in the sewer. So, it's time for, what is it time for? Will they use their first lifeline? It's ask the teacher or me. Yes, they're using it. The correct answer. Biology projects about the Baltic Sea. And how do they go about it? Very lazy hands here today. You'll do it in pairs. In a moment, we'll be choosing project partners. Does everyone understand? Okay, now. Do we have anyone without a partner? Hm? Ah, Emilia and Simon. Aw, look at the cute couple. Will it be a church wedding? I'll do mine alone. I see. So, Simon has to do his alone too? Is that okay? Fine. Emilia, take water systems and Simon, islands. Teacher. Yes Emilia? What do herrings need? Well, that's for you to find out on this project. I kinda need to know right now. What do herrings need the most? Well I guess, like all other fish, clean water most of all. And what have we said about messaging during lessons? Where is our degenerate going now? I'll give you a hint, lots of fresh air, he knows it well. Go outside and take a lap. Hey, look at that. Oh my god, let's take a picture. Here comes the aardvark. Oh my god. Who did this artwork? If we can't find the guilty party then everyone will clean. Anturo? It was her. No no. Emilia. Of course it was Emilia, we saw her. Yeah, we saw her. Well if Emilia won't confess then it's gonna be altogether. Thanks a lot Emilia. Yeah Emilia, some friend you are. Teacher, it was me. One, two, three, bang. There we have it. Simon will wash it. Chop, chop. It's okay to show your feelings, just not to trash your school. Why did you do that? They bully me already and we may have to move anyway. What, why? No more clients at the cove. The whole place is polluted and vandalized. No way, where to? Why do you care anyhow? Am I going crazy? Herrings are asking for my help. Or am I crazy already? I'm talking to a guinea pig. Emilia and I are going to the pool first. Where are the towels? Oh no. More horrible than I remember. Of all superheroes, why do I have to be guinea pig with these teeth? Sorry, nothing personal. Emilia, it's pool time. No, don't come in. Hey, is everything okay in there? Everything's fine. I'm doing my homework. Emilia? Are you all right? Is everything okay? Come on,. No, no, no. I don't have time. What do you mean? Emilia. Come on, it's time to relax. Emilia, where did you fly off to now? Seriously Emilia, no joking around. Emilia. What on earth are you doing? Emilia what's going on, are you okay? There you are. What're you doing? Biology. I see you bought the teeth and ears. Cute. Wear them for the carnival. Well then. I guess I'm super fur ball now. I can handle those herrings and Simon doesn't have to move. It's a bit lame to be a guinea pig but still, I'm a super hero. But first, I need to work on my flying skills. Hi. Hi, so if you could fly, how would you fly straight? Birds have tails, witches have a broom and superman has a cape. - Aha! - Why? And if you only have a scarf? Why only a scarf? I can't tell you right now, bye. Look at this. It was all good yesterday. A running wheel. Boo. Wee! Sorry! The herrings. Woo-hoo! Hi there mom. I'm at, no we're not on the computer. The homework is almost done. Bye. Woo-hoo! It's cold, it's cold, it's really really cold. All right, operation herring. Hello? Oh you made it, nice to see you. Sorry for not getting you then. I couldn't figure out a talking herring. I thought I was going, uh, you wanted to talk to me? Yes, we have a gulf shore catastrophe. Quiet, go do some herrings things, you. Uh, what's that gross stuff? Oh, that, all the time, that dura lock pipe keeps spewing poison. It's very difficult for us herrings. Usually we're easy going, but this is what poison does to herrings. We become mean and angry. Look. That unsuspecting school of perches moved here a few weeks ago. We used to be like that, swimming happily into one direction. But now all of that is. The whole gang is ocean crazy. Couldn't you find another part of the ocean? The perches have been all over the sea. Even worse pollution everywhere. We have to end the poison from entering our gills. You have to remember, a poisoned herring is an angry herring. An old saying in the sea. When a rowboat comes, it's the worst. It's a halloballu. So, how can I help you guys? We have to get out of here. Anywhere. Hm, mm. I almost forgot dessert. Emilia? Yes? Did you finish the cake? I was really looking forward to eating that. Oh no, there it is. Yeah. Mm-hm. Oh no, I look so terrib... Terrific, just terrific. If the herrings won't calm down, they'll ruin everything and Simon will have to move. I have to do something. Swim in here. No, no one to fight with. What is that smell? How's the temperature? Ocean, perfect, yes. Goodnight and no hullaballoo. No, no, no, no. Mission accomplished fur ball. What are those? They're herrings ma. Pertti, come here. Oh wow, fish. They're called herrings. Why are they in our bathtub? Well, I have this biology project and I have to study the growth and behavior of herrings. Oh, they look so good. You should fry them. No, you're not gonna fry them, okay? Crab and cream cheese filling sounds so good. Oh and instead of rye flour, bread them with crisp bread crumbs. Do we have crispy bread? No frying them and no crispy bread. Two days and then the bathtub is empty. But mom, do you want me to fail my project? I won't get in to high school or university and then I'll end up on the streets. Two days, okay? End of discussion. Oh, this is so much better. Babe, I can't find the crispy bread. Are you serious? We are not frying anything from the bathtub. Thank you Emilia. We feel so much better and cleaner. What do you herrings like to eat? Porridge? No. Cereal? Uh-uh. Or maybe yogurt? Yuck. I am wondering if you have... Dad always has animal plankton. Thank you. What do you need it for? It's just something, so you don't have to move. What do you mean? Fine, don't tell me. What's this? You're bringing algae to school now? You can't bring it to school. It's not algae, it's plankton. Now give it back. Simon, why did you do that? Shame on you Simon. Who made this mess out here? Who did it? Is it true? Was it him? Greasy always win. He can do anything and he's everyone's favorite. He always has cool stuff. His dad owns the butter factory down by the cove. He buys weird stuff for the school. He's probably the richest man in town, arranges all kinds of events. Good news from the Baltic. The vandalism at the cove has ended. Although the police did not find the perpetrator, Are the herrings still swimming around in our bathtub? Well, I have no other place to put them. I don't know what to do. Take them wherever you want, the tub must be empty in the morning. Ta-da! Tickets to a spa. A spa? Are you serious? Yeah, I won a raffle at work. Five tickets, can you believe it? I'm so excited! Emilia, we have two extra tickets. Would you like to ask Simon to go? He's not even answering my phone calls. I'm gonna ask someone else. Dad has a new girlfriend, Annelilla. I call her cotton swab Annelilla. Dad doesn't like the name and doesn't get the reference. Hi Emmy, hey. Ah, hi. Hey, you made it. Oh, yeah. Hey, good to see ya! Okay, what's going on with all the hugging? So unnatural, so uncivilized. All right, let's go swimming. Wait, hold on. I left something in there. What? Just remember to lock. There's a lot of human plankton here. On TV, I saw small fish eat dry skin from peoples feet. Sounds delicious. Who's hungry? Everyone, let's go, let's go, it's time to eat. Chlorine, no, chlorine is the worst poison for us. We go totally crazy, hullaballoo. Ah, everyone back, everyone back. This is no good, this is no good at all. Everyone, ah! Get back into the barrel now! Hey, get back now. Emilia! Well, we don't want to shut out any customers but herrings don't tolerate chlorine. But they could get used to it. If we sell people a luxury spa weekend, they don't want to be swimming in fish soup, now do they? But couldn't you maybe remove the chlorine? We are going home now. So sorry about this. That's fine. And you're welcome back any other time. Of course, without the herrings. Sorry ma'am, the sauna's full of scales. Yeah. And one more thing, just a tip, children need to have boundaries. How come I can't trust you to behave? Hey Em, cheer up. Mom was just embarrassed because of the herring fiasco. But she was so angry. She only gets mad because she loves you. Mom must have loved you a lot. Why? Why do you say that? She was always so mad at you. She had other reasons. Grownups are so weird. That's true, you can't understand them. There is one thing about mom. Simon, I tried calling you. Sorry, I must've missed it. What do you have in there? You can't bring that in to school. It's my biology project. Project? What is in there? Get that thing away right now or the janitor will take it away. Garry? I'm sorry but I can't think of another way. I have to take you back, do you understand? Yeah, big herring, not a cry baby. I'm so sorry, but what else could I have done? Emilia, you did everything you could. You tried to help, thank you. We have to solve this problem alone. There might be a big hullaballoo. This is not cool at all. Simon won't take my calls. He doesn't even sit with me at lunch. Have some more. You're so skinny, the winds gonna break you. Where's Simon? Now there's a skinny kid. Kitchen Donna is right. Simon should eat something, he's too thin. Once, Simon was waiting for a bus and a huge gust of wind swept him up. It flew him against the window in Ikea and he got stuck there. The police came over to detach Simon but it wasn't easy. Simon got so flat, it was hard to stand him up. All kinds of cool stuff keep happening with Simon. Listen, I gotta ask this. What's the hold up here? What happened to you Emilia? Nothing. Nothing? Maybe telling me would help? The water is so dirty in the cove that Simon's dad has to close their stand, then Simon will move away. I'm sorry honey. It doesn't matter anyway. He doesn't want to be my friend anymore. Even if Simon does move away, you'll still be best friends, sweetie. That's what counts. And listen, it's not too late to make up before he moves away. A good friend will forgive. Even dad and I don't fight anymore. You're right mom, I'll talk to him tomorrow and apologize. That's good. Oh, and dad told me something about you. And you're the best daughter in the world. Maybe we've grown apart like they say in Cotton Swab Annelilla's magazines. How do you grow apart? Why can't everybody just be friends? Why are some more embarrassing than others? Oh no, if Simon has to move away then we'll really grow apart. Hey, my night shift is starting soon. And lastly, an update on one of our ongoing stories. The situation at the Baltic Bay is heating up again. Vandalism in the bay of East Helsinki has returned with a vengeance. Last night, a food stand disappeared. What in the world? The police have no suspects. We don't have any suspects, this is a total mystery. Yeah, we're on our way to school. And then the fish pushed - the stand into the water. - So many fish. So many fish. I lost everything. Reed porridge, reed patties, plankton bars. What will I sell my customers? What will we eat? Where on earth is Simon? He's an hour late. He's never late when we have a test. The city is being vandalized, the water supply system is broken. It's difficult to investigate, the sea is busy under the surface but the divers don't dare go in. We're closely. Hey it's my dad, look, he's on TV. Yeah dad, you're the man. It's totally absurd to claim that our butter factory has anything to do with the problems in the bay. Well this is very strange, I've lived here all my life and. What're you doing? Where's Simon? Simon is not coming in to school today, he's moving away. No, he can't. I didn't have time to apologize or even talk to him. Hey. Hey, I know what causes all this. You do, really? Give me names. The power is gone because the herrings have done something under the sea. Ah, I see. Please explain in more detail. The herrings are getting sick because poison is pouring into the cove. They're going totally crazy. We need an extra broadcast and an emergency bulletin. We need the radio back on. Come on, cloppity-clop, hoppity-hop. Come on. I keep a spare generator for emergency. The radio will never die. Yeehaw! Our guest today, on our Prince One radio, is little Emelia Neeman, with hot news about our power outage. Go ahead Emilia. Yes, the power is off because the herrings are... Yeehaw, talk about herrings, let's listen to some herring music now. Emilia, you need to speak up because the generators, uh. Hullaballoo, hullaballoo, hullaballoo, hullaballoo hullaballoo, hullaballoo, hullaballoo, hullaballoo. Simon? Simon? Simon? Simon? Can I help you with something? Where's Simon? Previous tenants? They left already. No. They left so suddenly. This can't be happening. I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye. We were fighting the last few days, he was mad at me. It was all my fault. What was all your fault? Simon! I thought you had left already. We left some dry algae behind, we came back to get it. You can't move away, please. Found it. Hurry. Let's get going. Simon, I know what's causing all these problems but it's so strange, you're not gonna believe me. Try me. Okay. So a school of herrings from the cove came to shore to attack people. Environmental toxins mess with their heads. We should get them to safety. The herrings. Why didn't you say so? It's not the first time. Environmental toxins cause behavioral problems. There are many pipes on that sea floor, like the one from the butter factory and the main electricity line. That's probably what's causing the problems. The herrings are eating away at that line. Soon, they'll break everything. We have to save that cove. My dad tried already. We need to calm down those herrings right away. I'll handle the herrings so your dad can open his stand again and you guys won't have to move. What can I do? How do I calm down all the herrings? Why do I always fail? Emilia, you are a super fur ball. Not everyone gets that honor. What can I do as a guinea pig or whatever it is that I turn into? I don't want to be a mega fat fur ball with gigantic buck teeth. I won't do it. The appearance is no coincidence. Music please. Guinea pigs are cute, chubby and furry so that they can get close to people, especially close to children. And you were not made super fur ball by mistake. You are a resourceful child with a vivid imagination and you need to learn how to be brave. Emilia, if you're good as plain old Emilia, you're good as super fur ball. Be brave and say the most beautiful words out loud, "I am guinea pig, super fur ball". I am a fur ball, a super fur ball. I am a fur ball, a super fur ball. I am a fur ball, a super fur ball and I need that water bottle to be a super fur ball. Mom, where's guinea pig Halonen's bottle? Where's that bottle? In the dishwasher. Why is it in there? It wasn't clean then the power went out. Mom, open it. We can't open it mid cycle. We need to wait for the power. There will be no power if I don't get that bottle out of there. Don't be silly, trust me, you can't open it. What's with all this noise? For some reason, Emilia is worried about the cleanliness of our dishes. I need to get that bottle out. What bottle? It's Halonen's bottle in there. You can't be shouting like this in an apartment building. You can't open it mid cycle. All right, all right. All the water will come out. I know what I'm doing, let me show you how it's done. Thanks Pertti, you're the best. Woops. Here we go. This is not a good time. Emilia, where are you? Did you do your homework? Yes, well, almost. All right, well don't be too late and don't go near the cove. There's something unsafe happening down there, okay? No, of course not mom. Bye, gotta go! Make some space, make some space. Clear the area, divers are coming up now. I'm not going back in. No, no, no. The herrings are going crazy down there. Stop messing around with the nets, we need stronger equipment. I'll go in. The sea is my friend, the sea won't harm a friend. No civilians inside the perimeter. Get him out of here. Bite, bite as hard as you can, bite like you've never bit before. Herrings, I come in peace. Please don't attack. Let's negotiate, what could I do? It's too late, we don't want to live in a sewer anymore. This cove is not an open dump. We are up to our gills in this dirt. I'm one mad, bad herring who's putting an end to all of this. What was that? What was that? Okay, no more chewing. I'll go tell them your demands. Not in a sewer, not an open dump, up to our gills and they're mad. Fix the cable and get those crazy fish out of the water, no matter what. If they don't stop causing havoc - Hey. We're going to lose the entire cove. Get the big net. Hey. Hey! Hey, who are you? Hold on. Okay, listen to me. If people stop polluting the sea, they'll let the divers down to fix everything. They? The herrings. Stop that,. They don't want to live in a stew. This cove is no open dump. They are up to their gill, gill, you'll be in the guillotine if you don't agree. You hear this? Get the kid out of here. Stop. The herrings die, the sea dies, the world dies and Simon moves away. Crank the shank. Crank the shank. Hey, what's in the bottle? Hey kid, hey kid, come back. Why does this always happen? They will catch you in their net and make you into soup and fish tacos. Oh no, tell them we'll surrender, we'll surrender. No time, the net is coming. Help us super fur ball. We don't want to end up in a soup or a casserole. Help, help! Here we go. Crank, crank, crank. Uh, so, I guess the power cable could be, uh. Yeah, I guess we could fix it now, right? I could do it. All right, get down there already. The power shortage was caused by toxins seeping into the water, corroding the cable. It's a serious environmental crime. I can't comment on the pending charges at this point. We are cooperating with investigators but environmental industries are very dear to me, as well. For future generations. I have a family and a child. The power is back in and the citizens can sigh in relief. But the fish population has weakened. Herrings have disappeared all together. The state fishery says the situation will return to normal with time. Why are you still growling? Didn't I do what you guys wanted me to do? Simon! Hi. So cool you didn't have to move after all. Yeah. That was quite a hullaballoo at the cove last night. Nesting places to many species of birds. That's why reeds are the vital part of the ecosystem of our water bodies. The end. Thank you, very nice. Next up, we have Simon and the islands on the Baltic Sea. If you're good as plain old Emilia, you're good as super fur ball. Emilia, what are you doing? We did our projects together. I helped Simon and Simon helped me. Oh look, how cute. Sh, we're in the middle of our presentation. Sh, who do you think you're shushing? You, shut up Greasy Antero. Are you pals with him? No, not a pal, a friend, a best friend. Well then, islands, by Simon and Emilia. Aw, look at these love birds. So cute. Sh, will you be quiet? I want to hear what Emilia and Simon have to say. Antero, be nice, just like you were on TV last night. Simon. I was going to pack it in but then I thought, weed based food will soon catch on. Oh, as an appetizer, I recommend frog spawn. It's protein for the whole family. Three dollars only. Enjoy. Oh, hey Emilia. And here you go. Tada! This should be clean by next spring. Hi Emilia. Hi Antero. This is going to be wonderful, super fur ball. Thank you. And thank you for this temporary home. Love how the scenery opens up. Where did you put the rest of my gang? Well, I had help from my friends. Thanks. Run Simon! Can't be bothered. This is not my thing.
