- Are you sure no one's around? I'm sure. I don't know... - You nervous? - Mm. Hey, you don't need to be. Just be here, with me, in the moment. That's all you gotta do, alright? Well, yeah, but what if someone pops out of nowhere? This isn't a horror film, Sadie. Besides, can you think of a better place to go? We can always go back to your mum's. Now, you know we can't do that. Any idea? I'm all ears. It's fine. Nothing's gonna pop and get ya, alright? Come on. You're with me. I got something cool to show you about this land. Hey! You'll spoil the surprise. - Amityville? - That's right. Like the Amityville house? It's the same land. What do you mean, "It's the same land?" Two brothers lost their mind in their family house, and burned it down. Said they heard voices, telling them to do it. God that's twisted. I've never liked scarecrows. This isn't any old Scarecrow. Go on. How is this one so different? Me and some buddies come up here the other night, we swear we saw the thing move. Stop it. No, serious, we saw it move. And you know what I'm like with the supernatural, never believed in, gotta see it to believe it. But I swear, I saw it move with my own eyes. I am outta here. Hey! Come on. Why are you such a dick, James? What is wrong with you? You're too easy. I'm sorry. - No, fuck you. Hey, don't be like that. Come on. - I just don't get why you gotta be like that. I don't like it, you know I don't. I know, I know. I'm sorry. Me and the boys come up here the other night, fucking around, we found the Scarecrow in the back, thought it would be funny to put it up. Just a little joke. Alright? Come with me. I wanna show you the real surprise. See? I'm not all bad. Mm, fuck! - What's up? - I'm out. You can have some of mine if you want. Nah, don't worry. I got some more in the car. Let me go grab another one. You want one for later? - Sure. James? Come on out, James, it's not cool. - Hey... You should be excited. Hmm? Come on. I haven't seen her in so many years, it's hard to be excited, you know? What happened in the past is in the past. I'm sure she's grown up enough to realize that. What happened happened, and we just gotta go out there and get on with it. For your mum. Let's not forget why we're doing this. - I wish that, for Mum, none of this happened. There's always time to put things right. I call front seat. Not with your mother's driving, back seat it is. Really? Mum, you've got us, alright? So don't you dare feel like you can't be there. It's your land too, okay? Oh, come here. Come on, let's go. Okay? So, what's the plan with this place, Mum? I guess the easiest solution would be to sell it up. No need to spend any longer than is necessary in each other's space. So we get there, we agree on an outcome, and we part ways. - Are you worried? - I'm fine. - So how come you've not stopped biting your finger nails for the last hour then? Come on, it's alright. Deep breath. You have nothing to be nervous about, it's on her. She's the one that messed up. She needs to make this easy for you. And if she tries anything, we just leave. - Come on. - Thank you. First thing, that needs to come down. Why wasn't there any corn in the fields? - The stuff never grew. It's as though someone harvested it for years. Sad sorry state of affairs really. I was thinking, we can get a proper cornfield started out in the back. I'll show you the place later. But I was thinking a cornfield maze for the kids. It would be nice if after all these years, the corn actually grew. Come on. That one's the office. The vans all need to go. We need to get some high tech ones. If we want this place to be a success, we need to spend a bit on making it look the part. Let me go and take a little look, eh? Funny. Come on, sweetie. Come on, come on. Well, you might want to be a little bit careful. Might want to be mindful of folks trespassing. CCTV it is. I'll get some cameras ordered. You know, I'm not sure whether we need to splash out on an entire set of new vans. Lick of paint here and there, some refining, this could work just great. They need to look a little more modern, that's all. You think? - They're here. Give me a moment. Hey, Harriet. - Hi, Aunt Tina. You wanna go catch up with Lucy? Give me and your mom a moment? I'm fine, go on. - I'm not gonna bite, Mary. - Sure. I'll give you two a moment. Have you been here long? Not long before you. Are you gonna look at me? Do you have Mom's paperwork? - So how have you been? Good, you? - Yeah. Look, Harriet, I know what happened with my mum was like fucked, I do, I get it. I just... I'd like to get to know you again. We used to be so close, and I don't want this to affect us anymore. We're family. Look, you don't know me anymore. It's been a while since we hung. - We were just kids. - I know. But, what happened between our parents, that's on them. We had no part of it. So why should it affect us? Look I get what you're saying, I do. But with Mum, I just don't think that I can wave you around in front of her face, as a kind of reminder. - Yeah. Here we go. "I, Lydia Holder, hereby grant the land of Amityville Cornfield Campsite and Caravan Park and all buildings adjacent in joint ownership to the trustees of this will, Mary and Tina Holder. All decisions regarding the land must be mutual and in accordance with due consideration given to the intentions of the maker of this will at the time of purchasing the land." Blah, blah, blah... So, what are you feelings about the land? We sell it. And you really think that's what Mom would've wanted? Mom purchased this land for God knows what reason when we were kids. She has done nothing with it since she purchased it when we were little girls. The land has stood idle for so long, so I don't see why there is any problem with us selling it up, and splitting it to go our own ways. Well... What if I suggested that we use this moment as an opportunity to rebuild, not only the land into something that Mom would have been proud of, but a relationship together, to get back what's lost? You destroyed any chance of a relationship with me the day you started sleeping with my husband! That was a long time ago, Mary. It doesn't mean it didn't happen though, Tina. It doesn't mean I didn't go through what I went through. So I want this land sold, and we go our separate ways. I think that's the best solution for everyone. I messed up. And I know that, alright? But we are gonna turn this place around. We are gonna make something of this place, and reopen it like Mom wanted us to. - Tina... - No! Alright? We are gonna open this place, and make it what we remember as little girls, coming here in the summer, so excited for summer camp. We are going open this place and make it the camp we remember, and we are gonna make Mom proud. I want to sell it. You need me to sign off on that, and I won't do it. - Right. - Not yet. This place could be good for us. - I don't think I could ever trust you again. Well, things take time. It's gonna take at least a year to turn this place around. So we've got a chance, yeah? Just say yes, and we can try. All I'm asking for, is a chance. Okay. But if in a year I feel the same way, we sell up. We won't need to sell up. Let's hope you can scare 'em away, huh? Oh my god, do you remember that time when we tried on my mum's clothes and stole her lipstick? - The bright red one? - Luscious Rose, I believe it was called. Didn't you like... Yeah. - I was trying to impress Greg! - Greg! Oh my god, you were so obsessed with him! I remember snapping it in half. I was absolutely shitting myself about telling Mum. She like grounded me for a year over it! - Yeah, but you got Greg, right? Oh, yeah. We dated for like, the whole of two seconds? He was my first kiss, remember. - Of course I remember. You wouldn't shut up about it. - Amityville... - Yeah? Why does that sound so familiar? - That's what the land's called. Isn't that famous for when those murders happened? - What murders? Aw, typical, no signal. Hey, come with me to the end of the dirt path on the entrance to this place. I had signal then. It's when we got on this land that it went shit. - Come with? - Harriet, I'm kind of hungry. Please? I don't wanna walk down that creepy road on my own. - Okay. Come on. - I'm gonna go grab something from the car. Why don't you two catch up? No, that's okay, I can come. Mary? I think we should catch up. Oh fuck! We are so lost. - I think it was a right back there, not left. Oh fuck. Shit, these cars are so old. Some of these will be worth an absolute fortune. - What are they all doing here? - I don't know. These have been here years, I wonder if they still work. Hey there, baby. Do you wanna go for a ride? You know, we should tell our parents about this place. It's a goldmine in itself, we could make a fortune. I know. Some of these are classics. Why do people just park up and leave them here? Don't be so freaked out. It could be anything, stolen cars, abandoned cars, I don't know, anything. - What, and they're all just left in this area? Seems like you've got your signal back, so come on. Who's worth the trek, new guy? I wish. - Look how old this is. - No, look! Amityville murders. "The Richards family were slain in 1972 by their two sons, Donald Richards Junior and Mitchell Richards. In total, they shot five members of their family within the family home, going from bedroom to bedroom with a shotgun." They shot them dead! And what's that got to do with this land? Don't you see what I do? "It was said that Richards claimed to hear voices from the spirits within the walls of the house. The Richards Brothers had been reported to numerous doctors for complaints of hearing voices instructing to kill, telling him that his family were evil, born from Satan himself. The only way to stop the Armageddon was to kill them. The Richards boys was found in the early hours after the murders, and said they had no recollection of doing the crimes, saying that they believed a force took them over and forced them to murder. The land was purchased by a company who promised to turn it around, and in memory of the awful crimes, promised to call it Amityville. But instead, they were set to create a Summer Camp for people to come and enjoy themselves. The Summer Camp opened in the late '80s. The Amityville House itself was demolished. And the land was now set up as a caravan and campsite." Hey, What is this? Harriet, come check this out. What is this place? Okay, this is freaking me out now. Let's get out of here. How have you been? Well, the business never took off like I had hoped. Shit happens, I guess. I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted it to be a success - for your dad's sake. - Yeah. And you? How have you been? Fine. I've had Harriet so... No one new in your life? I had to support myself and Harriet as a single mother. That was hard, and time consuming. And I didn't find myself with countless hours to run around meeting new men. - You don't need to stay stuck in the past, Mary. And to be honest, I think you're being a little bit unfair. I paid what was asked, every month, on time. You were hardly strapped for cash now, come on. Maybe I didn't want to find anyone else. Maybe I didn't expect to find the need for someone else. I found what I wanted. And after that, I just didn't have it in me to go through that again, to potentially put myself through all that hurt again. I understand what happened was shit. It was so incredibly shit, and I'll never forgive myself for it, but... Sometimes people just aren't meant to be, Mary. I am sorry though. I really am. - It was so unexpected. I just wish when we had met you had told me that I didn't complete you, fulfill you. None of it was you, Mary. We don't need to keep going over the same old ground. I have moved on. Just because I don't have the energy to find a new man, doesn't mean I'm not happy. Your sister has missed you. You only get one chance in life, one life. Don't block her out over this. She'd do anything for you. I shouldn't be made to feel like I am expected to forgive. Although I have moved on, I can't just forget what happened, these things take time. I will give it a go, okay? No promises. - I'll give you a moment. - Yeah. You alright? Oh, Mum. I don't know what I was expecting really. I knew it would be hard seeing her. I knew it would bring back awful memories. I was stupid to think I could walk through the door with... And she would welcome me with open arms. I stole everything from her, her life, her future. You need to stop blaming yourself, Mum. This wasn't all your fault. Sometimes, you're just not meant to be, and she needs to realize that. Them two, they wasn't soulmates. - I'm her sister. - And she will forgive you. I'm not saying it's going to be easy, because it won't. But in time, she will, she will forgive you. When did you become so wise? I want you to wipe those tears away, because we still need to go choose what caravan we're staying in. And I've got something for you. What's this? A newspaper, from your generation. I thought it might spark some deja vu for you. Don't be so cheeky. I love you. I love you. - You scared the hell out of me. - Like old times, huh? - Sure as hell. God, do you remember this place? The Lodge, it was like hell. Whenever you were brought to the lodge, you always knew something bad was gonna happen. More you. I don't ever remember being brought to the lodge. You're right, to be fair. You never did get into much trouble. Usually because you took the fall. - Hey, I have something I wanna show you. - Sure. - What's this? - A newspaper from the '80s, about a year before this place shut down. A missing girl, Judy Cillan. - What about her? - I recognize her. I wanted to see if you did. No, I don't recognize her. Do you remember her from the summer camp? I think so, when we were little girls, but my memory isn't so clear. But she looks so familiar. Mom never mentioned a missing girl? - That's why it's weird. - Mom bought this place because she wanted to reinvent it. But she never actually did. A little something to ward off the crows. Creepy. Where'd you girls go out to earlier? You were gone some time. Here. We just went to go get some signal. You know we found some abandoned cars? Like classics, but a bunch of them. - Abandoned? What, you mean just waiting there? Yeah, up the dirt path. One of them even started. We should check that out tomorrow. That could be a nice little goldmine for us. - That, or we need to get someone to take them to a scrapyard. No, they were saleable, for sure. - Okay. - And we found a warehouse. A warehouse? Yeah, we went in. That's odd, I don't recall there being warehouse? Is it off the woodland? Yeah, do you remember it? Maybe. Hey, we can check it out tomorrow. Hey, the area... I didn't know that this was the land, Amityville, that those crimes happened on. Yeah, the Amityville murders, Christ. It happened back in the '70s. - Go on. - No, Derek. - Uh-uh, come on. You're not gonna run around scaring everyone - before bed, please. - Go on! - Go on. Well, some guy who lived in the house on the land, he flipped out, had visions of the devil, said the devil told him to do things. Then one day, he just picked up his gun and shot everyone down. Locals say that the land is cursed and the voices still lurk. - But no one's owned the land since Gram, right? No one has been on the land. That's enough of the horror stories. - Amityville Cornfield, not a surprise that no corn has ever grown here. After they demolished everything, the land fell to shit. Locals tried to plant and harvest, but nothing ever grew. Mysterious fires would just destroy everything. It was like the evil on the land was... Honey, it was just a joke! I just need a drink. - I'll get her. Tina, what's going on? - It's like I'm starting to remember something, but I don't know what. What do you mean? - The young girl who went missing while the camp was open, that was the year we were here, right? But I don't remember her being here. Why don't I remember her? That doesn't mean anything. I mean, I don't recall anything about being here as a kid and I'm three years older than you. I should remember, so should you. It's like I've blanked everything out. But certain things, they trigger something in my memory. Like the warehouse the girls saw earlier, it rang a bell in my mind, but why? - So the story goes, the evil lurks on the land. Any grudge that's been had with the land, remains, waiting to take its vengeance. How do you know all this? - Legends, from when we were growing up as kids. People were scared of the land after the summer camp shut down. It felt cursed. Why did the camp close? I have no idea. You know it's said that a spirit can inhabit a host, an object, toys, dolls, anything that can hold the evil spirit. So what about the scarecrow? What about it? Well, that's been the land, right? What if that's got something trapped inside it? - Why is my head blank in that period of time? I don't understand it. I remember being here, I just don't remember that girl. Oh, you were a kid, Tina! But surely I would remember something that big? A young girl went missing. Surely that would be in my mind, it would've been big news! - I really think you're overthinking this. - Am I? Well, let me ask you something Mary. And I want an actual answer from you, an honest answer, alright? Do you really think that Mum, that she purchased this land to make a summer camp? Answer me, Mary. Because it's not ringing true for me, not anymore. She purchased this land to reinvent it, and then she moved us to the UK and sat on it for 20 years. Why would she do that? It just doesn't make sense to me. Why purchase a plot of land and not do with it what you set out to do? So what we going to do? Summon it with a Ouija board or something? - It just moved. - What? You didn't see that? Oh, Dad, stop messing about. - Something isn't right. It just isn't adding up to me. Do you wanna leave? We could grab a hotel, come back in the morning. No, I can stay the night. But I wanna check out that warehouse. - Dad! - So not funny! - I'm just messing with you. - Look, it's old wives' tales. Let's unveil the big bad... What the hell is that? Oh my god! - Dad! - Girls get back! We've gotta get out of here! - Mum, come on, come on! - Who is that? I don't know, but we need to get the hell out of here. When I put that scarecrow up this morning, it was made of straw. Someone is out here fucking with us. We need to get to the cars. I don't have the keys they're in the other van. Tina, go with Mary. I'll take the girls to the cars, - we'll meet you there. - Okay. - What the hell is happening? - Stop looking at it. Okay? Stop looking! Come on now, alright? Come on. Come on, Mary. Come on! Come on. - Where are they, Mary? - Harriet is the driver and she put them... - I got them. - Okay. Come on, let's go. Who do you think did that to him? - Something we don't know about, and this whole time, stalking us. Girls, shh. What is he doing? - Is that another... - Oh, don't say that. Dad, come get in the car! Dad, come on! It's just straw. It's just straw. Girls, it's okay it's just straw, it's just straw! - Dad! Dad! - Dad! No! Dad! Dad! Dad! Mum, go! What the fuck is going on?! Wait, where's Lucy? She's still in the car! Oh, God. Come on! Fuck you! - What was that? - What is it? It's Lucy. She's running down the path. - She got away. Thank Christ. She will get out of here, and she'll call the police. Oh, God. It's her phone. She's a smart girl, she will run to the nearest house and come back with help. I don't know about you, but I didn't see a house for miles around here. - I can get out of here. I can run to where I was before, I had signal there. I can call the police, I've got signal! - It's not safe, Harriet. - What choice do we have? What the fuck is he doing? Get down! Oh, God! I've gotta get out of here, Mum. - No, I can't lose you. - You won't. Look after her, alright? Distract that thing while I get out of here. The back window, climb out of it. Harriet, get ready. Tina, no. Where the fuck did you go? Harriet, now! Hold it! I can't. It's too strong. Oh! Oh, God, no! Let's get to the lodge. Come on. - Go! Come on, come on, come on. Mary... Look here. That is us right? Yeah, and that's that girl Judy. Why don't we remember her? - Do you remember the caretaker? - Yeah. - Lester Wilter? Mm-hmm. He was suspected of the little girl who went missing. - "Lester Wilter, having worked as a caretaker for the first three years at Amityville Summer Camp, claimed to have heard voices immediately before the young girl vanished. Claiming the land to be cursed, and spirits to reside on the land, he was let go of his position just short of six months before the camp closed." What if he did something to that little girl? - But... "Lester Wilter, having not been seen since the day the camp closed." - I don't understand what any of this means, and why we don't remember this. 911 Operator, and what's your emergency, please? - Police, please. - Connecting now. - Police. - Hi. We need police now. I'm in Amityville Cornfield, the old summer camp, please come quickly. - What is the emergency? - Something is trying to kill me and my family. Something? Can you state animal or human? Miss? Miss? - Tina? - What is it? Mary? Look at this birth certificate. What does this mean? - That little girl who disappeared, she was our sister. He's dead, Harriet. He killed our dad. He was always more of a dad to you than he was to me. I hardly remember him. I felt so guilty when he left you and he moved in with Mum and me. I felt like I'd stolen him from you. He always loved you Harriet, so don't you ever think he didn't. He felt awful about what happened. He was a good man. And we're gonna get through this. What do you think that thing is? Scarecrow? Look, I know what Dad said was a joke, but what if it actually had some truth to it? What if a spirit can attach itself to an object? What if something from Amityville has attached itself to the scarecrow? It's gone. - Why did Mom hide this from us? Why didn't she tell us we had a sister. I just don't understand. I guess she didn't want us to know the crime had happened. She wanted us to live a decent life, without that looming around the family. We don't have the same surname as Judy, so I guess she changed our names when she moved us to the UK, and started fresh. And maybe she purchased the land to stop it from re-opening. So where did Lester go? If he was never caught, what happened to him? Wait here. - Oh! Mary, no! Tina, sit here. I'm not letting you go out there alone, I'm coming with you. What's that? Is there anything on there? Is this thing on? Hi, girls. If you're watching this, it means either I've told you, or you're on the land and somehow gotten hold of this. The date is October 16th, 1993. I'm gonna tell you something I should've told you a long time ago. Years, they go by so fast. And whenever I tried to tell you the truth, the lies had gotten so big, I just couldn't. Maybe one day I'll face the skeletons in my closet. I had another baby, before you were born, a daughter, Judy. She was three years old when you were born, Mary. But neither of you remember her. Whenever I mentioned the name Judy, you just looked blank. So I let you forget about her, because I didn't want you to know the full tragedy of what happened to her. It was summer 1984, the second year of summer camp. And there was this man, Lester. Everyone looked at him, they thought he was kind. He had a workshop, he... One day he... Judy went missing along with two other children. Their bodies were found several days later in the cornfield. The cops told us they had been kept alive in that workshop, and... You scare me sometimes, Tina. You don't remember Judy, but you remember Lester, and you remember being in that workshop a lot. But whenever I ask you the details, you just blanked it out. Your sister, the horrors, everything. But that's not all. The other parents and I, we wanted revenge. So, before he was arrested, we locked Lester in the workshop. Then we set fire to him. The workshop, it... The fire took ahold and the cornfields and the land around it was ablaze. Mama... - Later I bought the land, to hide my secret. But the corn, it never grew back. It was like a curse. And the house, the original Amityville house, it was... It must never be touched, none of it. It must be left to rot. - Tina, whatever you are thinking in this moment, you've got me. I will be with you forever. I'm so sorry. It makes sense now. All these years, the weird images I have in my head, they make sense. - I'm so sorry. Harriet, no, wait! We can't just sit here. They don't know where we are. - What if it's out there? - Come on! Come on. That thing, what do you think it is? Do you think it's him? Lester? When Mom killed him, if what they say about Amityville is true, it's not a far stretch. Come on, we gotta get out of here. Who goes there? It was me! Harriet Childs. I was the one who called. You've gotta help us. Our mums are back there and something's after us. Slow down. What do you mean, "something?" You wouldn't believe us if we told you what was going on. Try me. We've just gotta get out of here. - Listen they sent me down here, so I need to know what I'm dealing with. A scarecrow. It's on the land and it killed our Dad! You know if you're joking, I can take you back to my car, and then back to the station, and have you two arrested for wasting police time. We're not joking! That thing is real. So you said it murdered your father, like, over there. Yes! Go see for yourself if you don't believe us! But please, you've got to help us! - Have you girls been over there? Yes, we went there earlier. Alright, stay back, go into your car and lock the doors, I'm gonna go check it out, okay? God damn crows. What's taking her so long? - I loved him. - I know. I know you did. Tina, we are gonna survive. We are gonna get out of here. Let's get in the car and go kill that thing. What are you doing? Harriet? - I can't just sit here. - We've got to do something. Miss? Hello? Hello? Lucy! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy? Lucy? Lucy? Lucy is that you? - Mary? I know you loved him too. I'm sorry. I know, after all these years, you never fully moved on from him. And somehow, in a way, I think he missed you at times. Tina, it's alright. I'm fine. It's alright. - What's that? - I don't know. No! When I was a little girl, the warehouse, it's, I remember that song. - Tina, go! Run! I am going to get Harriet. My daughter. Tina, would you please get out of here? - I can't lose you too. You're not going to lose me. Oh! Oh, God! Mum! No! Hey! Lester, you knew I would come back, didn't you? You've been waiting for this moment. It's time to finish what you started. And it ends with you! Whatever you did to those kids, it's not happening again! Do you hear me? It's not happening again! Get out of here, Mary! Mary, get out of here! Go! Fuck you. You sure about this? We keep the land, we don't let anyone come here. We protect the land as Mom wanted us to, together. - We keep Mom's secret.
