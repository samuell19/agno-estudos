aircraft made in one after much controversy and many delays approval has been granted for an experimental flight from new york to paris seeking a world record flight time of 2 hours and 40 minutes faster than any commercial airliner has ever traveled and now here she is sst come on willie let's go take some vows they're all yours my fun was wasn't building that lovely just you want to get some

of a carefully staged event but i think it's also fair to say that the excitement is genuine that the america is about to launch the fastest commercial airliner in the world potential customers should be impressed by the aircraft's 275 feet capability and also the cruising speed of nearly 2 000 miles per hour do you have any idea how many firm orders have been booked they didn't tell me that part

lounge say who is that old boy uh that's paul whitley the man i used to work for president of whitley electronics well opportunity knocks let's go and have that drink oh let's not bob he was just being polite oh what's wrong with us being polite i honestly don't feel like a drink but then have coffee or tea anything come on come on a guy like whitley i could use a break you we're experiencing a little clear air turbulence and we should be through it very soon and meanwhile please note we've turned on the seatbelt sign thank you now i remember my memories like a trick knee it pops in and out fairbanks the other guy that was involved with that big brouhaha a few years back they took away your pilot's license everything would lock me out of the terminal for needlessly risking the lives and the safety of the passengers in your charge there's nothing wrong with your memory mr bassett things i remember i remember pretty good there's the things that i forget i don't remember at all were you guilty i was flying from los angeles to atlanta over new mexico a passenger suffered a heart attack a major heart attack i radioed the nearest airport told him to have an ambulance standing by and went in for a landing well they busted you out for that it wasn't exactly optimum weather it's kind of hairy coming in well you didn't have to report that quietly i didn't my co-pilot did you know him he's your captain what hi lyle hi carla mrs kingman hi glad to see you out among them again oh we still make a few of the freebies last week we opened a hotel in tucson and did a telethon in abilene well you're a-list with me and with a lot of other people i know my kids would rather meet you than anybody i can think of well thank you it's nice to think maybe all those sunday afternoons added up to something the rumor mill has it that you maybe do some congratulations from what i read bar crest estates means to be the biggest thing in arizona it's nothing definite it's not said yet well if it's right i wish it to you i'm gonna grab a drink two more hours and i'm on again buy satellite yet you do have an offer you're not thinking of taking that that mike real estate thing hey it's a job a big one like hellman's not offering you a job he wants to buy your reputation because his own is so rotten you said that so i got to know him better 65 000 feet captain we are at altitude set cruise control setting cruise control 1.7 on the eepers looks good at 2.5 ladies and gentlemen this is captain walls if you look out your windows you'll see a sight that very few except the astronauts have ever seen although the sky above remains black the aircraft itself is in full sunlight we are literally at the edge of outer space a couple of flutters on the pressure gauge and falling that leaky seal must be acting up again switch to backup hydraulic system switching to secondary hydraulics i better go have a look okay yeah hop to it so if it all works out we'll be married in the spring but then you are engaged well that's great just great well it's not well the deal isn't quite nailed down yet but i'm working on it sales is my line and if i can't close in paris then i don't deserve it how is he selling himself man well we're here together well and i'd say he is a very good salesman i think so huh i know so she worked for me for three years and i i couldn't sell her on staying you know what i can't quite figure out anne is why you left if i had the opportunity i'd certainly rather work for you really count your blessings because if she hadn't left me if she hadn't left whitley you might never met her um how about a refill the captain this is phillips uh i think you um i think you better get down here now what's the problem the seals they're just not holding up can you unplug them or replace it i'm afraid not in flight some solution here that's what you're here for well there's only one solution you have to turn this back and land at the nearest possible airport for a simple hydraulic leak come on the manual is very clear on that captain forget forget the manual these these seals are defective they could blow at any second seen every variety of leaky seal and i've yet to see one give completely hey captain i know when i'm talking about this when i'm here i'm telling you that if we don't turn back if my tail between my legs with another company two months away from having their plane in the air like nothing better than to see us fail come on captain you don't understand it if we keep going we're gonna be you get out a pump you start drying this stuff up this plane stays up you got it captain you heard me get busy atlantic satellite control this is made in one patch me through to air rink i need an emergency line to marshall coal cutless maintenance kennedy new york all mike wants me to do is talk to the money boys uh country club boys bend the elbow slap a few backs make a few commercials for which he is going to pay me a percentage a generous percentage of every dollar he makes mile he's a crook you know it and i know it he has not been convicted of anything you're forgetting we're broke stone cold bare-knuckled broke i'm trying to find a way for us to survive and if that means doing it to them before they do it to us so be it i know you're hurting lyle but you don't believe that you don't believe a word of it don't you think so you've been living with a stranger cookie because that's the gospel according to lyle kingman it could be a pump would he got too much pressure uh when you get to paris replace the entire hydraulic assembly including the backup unit that'll be everything you'll need at the goal uh roger sir phillips has just come up sir i don't care what walt says we uh we can't make it oh damn it phillips i'll settle down both of you if it leaks at twice the present rate you'll have plenty of pressure seals don't disintegrate they are disintegrating i'm telling you anybody with a pair of eyes can see that hey what are you trying to kill us all you idiot i don't care fire me just turn this thing around less you're a pro behave like one this is not just a promotional event a whole future right on that flight i will not abort it that is final it's called that now you wouldn't be saying that if you only knew that i've heard it you're there to solve problems not create them get on it did you hear get on it jellyfish oughta be in a hangar not a plane what are you waiting for lindbergh he's dead let's get out to the prototype and try to think this one out you're really upset you're serious about that guy well that's one for the books what'd you do in bed sir from hot tea and lemon don't equate agent virility it doesn't track the point is that paul whitley was a warm compassionate decent man who had a very positive effect on the woman that you fell in love with great great i'll keep that in mind when i pay my social security taxes don't start me defending him or we may both regret it okay okay i'm sorry help yourself that's not what i had in mind i think i've got work to do i've got a schedule remember the hotel by the mandolin we get to paris why don't we i remember a lot of hotels that's the trouble with me i've always been a pushover and that's bad because the man you happen to be in love with can go flying off and come back years later and feel free to say how about it sweetie no hank it's not that i think less of you but i think more of me hey yeah willing hey look down that wing what do you see i don't see anything what am i supposed to see that's not a control surface moving i haven't been for the last five minutes the plane's not on autopilot and it's not being flown manually come on willy captain you've got to turn this aircraft around come on phillips no more you understand captain the the seals are deteriorating because there's uh there's detergent in the aerosol it's corrosive there's what that's not only crazy it's impossible i'm telling you it's detergent the beginning of leaving captain you've got to believe me i know how do you know i know because i put it there make a course correctional going home we're not turning disconnect the autopilot autopilot disengaged controls are locked we've lost all hydraulic pressure keep out take everything is shorted out i told you why didn't you listen we could have been home by now so how do we fly this thing we don't we're as good as dead why didn't you turn back you've killed us all as long as we're in balance and we're flying level we're okay if we hit turbulence and nose down we'll go all the way in the passengers start moving around have the same effect you better lock them in their seats what i'm in charge here and i don't want to hear or see anybody but crew members now is that clear well let me clarify something i built this plane i built it to fly whatever i can do to keep it flying i'm gonna do all right hank let's go and see how bad it is below i might give you a small discard that was the game that charles proposed to me during the halftime you scored four touchdowns remember i should that was the biggest sunday i ever had well yesterday's uh this is captain walt we're experiencing an in-flight problem there's no cause for alarm but we have turned on the seat belt sign and asked that all passengers return to their seats and remain there until further notice i repeat do not leave your seats thank you an in-flight problem there's nothing to worry about folks all that means is the captain has dropped his glass eye into his martini as soon as he recovers it he'll be confident enough to let us move around again oh my god why did you do that for money i never thought i would come to this why didn't walsh do what i told him he was supposed to turn back before it got this far and my poor plane was to hobble home discredited a watchman picked up the order said it i'm gonna kill you really but get out of here i'll tell you one thing you're getting the money's worth because you've killed the plane but what about the people what about 250 people up there what are we going to tell them it wasn't supposed to happen this way don't you understand who it was well i said only one satisfaction and that's if we go he's going to die with us ronnie should promote me huh i was supposed to be production supervisor none of this would have happened i was entitled shut up what's the trouble probably nothing you're either upset or angry which one is it try both look while i don't give a damn about status about lifestyle anything you do is fine with me i'm with you all the way climb into a garbage pail with mike hellman you're on your own i'll be gone i love you too much to watch you do that to yourself jordis yes what's going on why are we suddenly glued to our seat just routine precaution there's no need for alarm that's no answer i want an answer sir the captain will keep us informed now just relax did you hear that coffee tea or simple syrup she's just doing her job yeah well i hope they're doing theirs stewardess what is the problem nothing serious i have to know it's being corrected sir don't worry don't worry yeah don't worry that's what i keep telling you that's what you said before look what happened he did it deliberately we shouldn't have turned him down for production supervisor we should have shot him now let me get this straight now spoilers flaps the trim don't respond at all no sir we have zero hydraulic pressure in both the primary and the backup systems we can't go up down a turn what about your power engines are okay if we stay level we can stay up until we run out of fuel oh come on you get a five hours fuel supply we'll get you out of this long before that stop telling us what you're gonna do start doing it we're into it willie hank i appreciate your help but you're a passenger on this fight you're gonna have to leave the cockpit regulations you want to become friends get us to paris what do you propose to do about the situation would you say that marriage was a reasonable consideration it's certainly a consideration but uh there are others i mean there are there are clinics hundreds of clinics all over the place where the only thing they do say that one to me don't you ever say that word to me okay okay okay i won't say the word but it's gonna ruin your figure and it's gonna ruin your career having a baby's gonna ruin that dynamite figure you got baby tell her doc babies do not ruin a woman's figure that is an old wives tale isn't that right doctor there yeah well what about overpopulation there's already too many people in the world tell her doc wait a minute you just wait a minute i want to see what dr thurman has to say about it well i think i've said too much already there it goes better tell them this is captain walsh due to a temporary malfunction with the passengers in the first two rows of the forward compartment please move to the rear of the aircraft immediately rose number one and two please take a seat in the rear lounge uh our cabin attendants will assist you thank you okay folks you've heard the captain rose one and two to the rear lounge

of envelopes with heavy duty wire and connecting clips down to plug in eddie will direct them from here eric roy wait marshall that detergent is dangerous stuff they're not going down there with blow torches but i'd still wait for the fumes to clear i appreciate your advice willie walsh get on it how is he all right how are you look i don't know what happened i i was thinking about you and him and all of a sudden there he was what's happens happened be awfully dumb to give up ten months for a lousy two and a half hour plane ride all we can do is forget it and go on from here what is it you're going to do lore 41 to cutlass anger nakamura here ready and waiting mrs connect the first clip to the main generator at g4 roger roger stand by g4 it's in that middle panel right over there we're hooked in at g4 connect the second clip to the solenoid s2 opposite side along the transformer proceeding solenoid s2 lookup i can help help why not this tail's in the same range as ours it's the second one there on the right second one down so be very careful this is grab your oxygen come please acknowledge anyone please acknowledge one hmm attention this is emergency all passengers in the forward compartment go immediately to the tail section if you can't find a seat for rocky demand use the buddy system cabin crew will instruct you all right everyone you heard what the captain said

off here breathe okay stay here please do something blow me down you're cutting up my circulation you're cutting off my circulation sorry hank fairbanks cutlass hangar explosion award i'm filling in for captain walsh explosion any casual nation probably we're dropping at 5 000 feet per minute me circuit back to your seat and put on your oxygen mask i put a biological board have to see if it was damaged where is it in the bag you can't possibly get there in flight but i'll tell the captain i get it hold on doc we got to get back to seat hunter there you go get the seat belt honey okay it's gonna be all right okay come on still allows come on let me have it right i moved the passengers to the rear to try to get us back into palace she's leveling off what's the altitude 10 000 feet i like a little more falling down room at least they won't need oxygen anymore tell them walsh this is captain walt we've reduced our altitude to 10 000 feet now you can breathe now without oxygen i'll take over now the man saved your aircraft captain forgotten how to say thank you when he ever said the man wasn't a good pilot appreciate what you did we all do don't mention it a little gratitude never hurt anybody carla carla it's all right you can breathe now carla carla look at me i'm breathing normally you can let go of that now you don't need it it's all right it's all right i'm sorry living this sort of thing is not the same as reporting it all right everything's going to be fine it's all right is anybody hurt is everybody reasonably okay good these freebies are really getting to be something they make you work for them i'll be back in a minute hey listen everybody let me tell you something about this little disturbance do you know it's more dangerous to cross the city street than it is to fly the atlantic in an airplane now we're gonna make it i guarantee it matter of fact i'll stake my life on it just settle down folks everything's gonna be okay can i have your attention please now listen to me now let's everybody hang together and not give the good people flying this machine any more trouble than they've already bought that helped thank you i think you realize how urgent this is doctor he said he'll see you please give him a few minutes more to get things settled down stewart hey doc it smells like a hospital in here somebody in for knee surgery oh god there's a biological board a viral material suspended in chloroform the container must have ruptured the captain must see me now i'll go with you you were right willie never sent the man down there the paper had worked well they're gone and we're about to join them if we don't get some hydraulic pressure back in these controls is there a way to divert the drinking and hand water into those hydraulic lines well even if there was it still go pouring out through the broken seals yeah but it'll give us maybe three minutes of pressure that's three minutes of stick time you give me three minutes i can land this thing what do you think marsha my work looks like it's our best shot it's our only shot yeah now our problem is how do we bank and make course corrections until we can find a place where we can't put it down we can switch fuel from one wing tank to another yeah yeah that's right do that do that sending a tank a few from one side to the other would would turn the queen elizabeth now we'll get to work with the water connection now keep the line open okay let's do it you've got the pumps let's see if we can turn this thing come on hallelujah while you did it uh this is the captain i'm happy to report that we have restored partial controls and we are now back on course to paris thank you i must speak with you captain hey that virus is racing through this plane right now flu is a lump word to cover everything from a 24-hour stomach upset to the hong kong or swine variety each strain has its own symptoms its own death rate i was around in 1918 when one of those bugs swept around the world killing and so could this it broke out in senegal the african mortality rate is already close to 30 percent that's why the rush to get to the pasta institute hope to get a vaccine how long is incubation period oh it hits fast with some people an hour others a day first starts with throat ulcers followed with high fever and lung congestion and i was the one that told him to take it aboard that'll add to the legend huh what are you going to tell the passengers nothing our hydraulic system is out our chances of landing are less than 50 don't ask me to cope with the play note of hysterics and for what it's worth that's confidential he's right if anybody gets sick nothing can be done until we land if we land from water valve n1 to s pipe joint at v6 on the lower hydraulic line and one of these six roger i'll take it from here family let me help you no it's okay listen you go tell the cool close the john cena restrict drinking water get going roger hank tell me straight how much trouble are we at come on we're both pros we've got some problems we're gonna make it there's a little hotel by the madeleine if we make it if we make it you've got a date hell i guess i'm still a pushover the goal approached a goal approach this is cutlass maiden one at one zero thousand mid and one this is the goal approach ident maintain one zero thousand approach we are declaring an emergency request priority landing with crash equipment on standby roger amid one we have monitored your transmissions you have priority clearance good luck sir i'm sorry to have to remind you captain but as i said you must tell them your maiden wanted to go request emergency quarantine we are carrying contagious biological material what is purpose of quarantine the maiden one is in biological material contained repeat is biological material contained negative de gaulle unit is not contained roger maiden we will have to advise health and immigration and check on quarantine facilities what is the nature of contagion flu senegal flu please stand by miss captain walt we're awaiting a technical clearance we'll keep you informed thank you geez those guys deserve a medal now what this company deserves is a fat lawsuit well one battle a day is enough for me what we all deserve is a sure he's drink right it's just past his bedtime that's all the ministers um turning off the lights and the acg the goal to maiden one i regret health and immigration advisors you cannot land with your senegal flu not contained say again the gulf say again middle one i regret it is not my doing you cannot land at the goal you cannot land anywhere in france we have no way to arrange for quarantine facilities so quickly we would require at least 24 hours to prepare then clear us for an airport that can we will do what we can continue if they won't take us who will they'll find us an alternate there has to be a way to isolate this thing it's already isolated up here with us this is fumiko air station roma please inform maiden one that because of special condition aboard permission to land must be denied at this time the goal this is madrid air control officials inform us there is insufficient time to prepare quarantined facilities we monitor you unfortunately permission to land is denied also by brussels oslo amsterdam stuttgart and london we will continue trying but we must ask you to leave french airspace immediately may i see you doctor this is the captain again we are unable to land in paris as scheduled we'll inform you as soon as we're cleared by an alternate airport i anticipate no problems and there's no cause for alarm thank you doctor what's wrong just somebody not feeling well anybody who does feel well ought to be in a straight jacket maiden one to marshall cole cutlass hanger urgent come in marshall get back to me as soon as you can marshall call here marshall you won't believe this i believe it we've been monitoring hang on i may have some good news i've got the state department putting pressure on london they tell me there's some kind of agreement a bilateral treaty covering emergency landings they're talking to the ministry of health now according to state they have to let you come in great one way or another we'll get you down getting down is no problem we can get down by ourselves we got a whole ocean to get down here standby you want to buy an airplane no but i go top dollar for a life boat is it difficult to swallow and more like it's on fire you'll have to remain here stay covered up and rest you've got the flu flu that's it all listen i i once beat pneumonia and hepatitis in the same afternoon good strong constitution is your best chance best chance i don't warn you doc when i took up golf i quit going to church look there is no point in us catching it besides we should be in the back with the others the weight you weigh more than i do go ahead let somebody else play nursemaid it's him or me and now make up your mind won't be silly go where you belong i'm already there i made the mistake of leaving you once i'm not gonna blow it a second time look at the ears of mixed doubles you think i've got left in me i'll take whatever it is uh lucky me well paul whitley too tends to strike the young and elderly first catches it the beginning in the end cutlass hanger calling maiden one come in one go ahead i hear this london will honor the treaties they don't want you but they're going to take it the preparing emergency equipment is setting up a quarantine station proceed immediately to heathrow london roger sir roger roger just a minute there's no way to quarantine against this without adequate notice you'd have to seal this plane in plastic to stop it from spreading with no lead time at all all they could do was jerry-rigged something they might as well do nothing we have no alternative we have two and a half maybe three hours fuel left and that's it if you land in london we'll be responsible for spreading this contagion i remind you captain we're talking about a 30 mortality rate look i listened to you once now everyone in authority is notified of our condition it's their responsibility to granted deny entry my responsibility is to the people of this plane let's see how far it is to senegal what that's where the disease originated i mean you can't do any more harm it's already been done maybe the flu has run its course wait a minute it's very probable that only dakar airport has has quarantined facilities our destination is london could we make it to senegal i don't know our fuel is marginal if we make it we'll make it by the skin of our teeth look forget it hank i have my orders and my responsibility is to the company the passengers and nobody else what about the passengers don't they have anything to say about this no they don't it's my decision gentlemen i'm afraid you'll have to leave the cockpit it's going to get pretty busy why don't you find out how the passengers feel go on ask them gentlemen please so that's the choice if we choose london we run the risk of starting an epidemic with a more than 30 mortality rate if we pick senegal we may not be able to stretch our fuel that far there's an even chance we won't make it and it's london i'm with you friend as long as we don't ask ourselves how many people were willing to let die to ensure our survival as long as we feel no moral obligation to anyone else what about the cities that turned us away what about their moral obligation we can't speak for them only for ourselves what we have to ask ourselves is whether there's more to life than just surviving whether it's important how you survive don't give me that look we didn't ask to be here we're not volunteers nobody even told us there was a health hazard on board we're innocent and this joker here is telling us we have to die well nobody dies well that's why we're going to london agreed right london london i say london yes london london i say synagogue senegal london senegal wherever that is it's on the equator and not very attractive senegal london i'm i'm sorry senegal so if your decision is to go to senegal please raise your hand listen there's some place closer london for god sakes london senegal sure what else senegal way things have been going today the limousine probably wouldn't been there to meet us anyway those for senegal in a section i'll tell them up front you say you're responsible to the passengers well the passengers by a vote of three to one have decided for senegal it's insane maybe it is but the passengers voted senegal they remind you this isn't a town meeting there's one vote that counts you that's mine and we're headed for london will you for once in your life make a decision on your own not everything in this world is covered by the faa book of rules and regulations well i know you never paid much attention to that kind of thing you threw the book away in your career with it i broke one of those precious rules not one damn it dozens you didn't just come in under the minimums you know it was sucked in at zero and you picked an airfield so small i didn't even have an approach radar facility you bet the lives of everybody on board that you could force a landing on a runway that was 500 feet too short and never intended to handle an aircraft that large you want me to go on i made the landing yes but only because you were the best or the luckiest a number one fly by the city or pants pilot this company ever had and you were wrong your decision the land in west texas was unprofessional and irresponsible that has nothing to do what's happening has everything to do with it because you still think that a pilot of a commercial airline is some kind of a rodeo star a barnstorming stunt flyer with a white scarf tied around his neck that attitude didn't belong in the cockpit when you were busted and it doesn't belong here now god how long will it take for that to sink in you're right walsh that was wrong i guess it was easier for me to blame you and face myself and if that's true if that's true then i risk the lies of a lot of people in order to save one i admit it i was wrong i made a mistake a bad one but aren't you about to do the very exact same thing well should take this plane into london and you'll be risking the lives of a great many just to save a few enough of important people on that plane i don't want them inconvenienced our representatives in london have already pulled all strings necessary to get them out of quarantine as soon as possible understand over washi we're changing course sir changing change of course aware dakar airport senegal are you crazy yes maybe you take that plane straight to london that is an order you read me over i read you sir cutlass maiden one out thank you captain walsh well you better check with the senegalese people make sure they have no objections shouldn't be a captain at all or be a general what are the ads doctor i don't give odds mr whitney just which means the odds are not so good people don't seem to realize they answer the question by not answering the question i'm not one of those people i have an answer just waiting for a question what's the answer yes what's the question will you marry me i thought you'd never ask i did once before only that time it was the wrong answer then if i swore i wasn't gonna cry you were praying ah sir i was making deal if he gets us there safe and sound we'll make it permanent can i ask you one more favor when we get married on our honeymoon can

we our brother's keeper the majority of our fellow passengers answered yes they backed it with their lives but the vaccine will they develop it in time to make all this worth it well there are a lot of good people at the disease center in atlanta still working on it and we've radioed back and they've already sent a culture onto the pasta institute one of them will crack it good luck gotta get

won't they be infected no guarantees captain but they're all volunteers who were previously exposed to the virus with no ill effects they'll be joining us in quarantine will i see you at the hospital
