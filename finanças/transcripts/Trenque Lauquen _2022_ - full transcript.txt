Exactly, Clara. Imagine, if I’ve come here, it’s precisely because of that. I’m going back now and I have to give a load of explanations and they’re going to have to be very clear. Yes. Yes. But she didn't... If she said otherwise it would be a different story, but she hasn’t. She hasn’t clearly stated that she doesn’t want the position. She hasn’t said "I don’t want the position." Sure. No… Yes... If I come all the way here it’s not to be told no, it’s to get a yes. Exactly. If she... If she wanted to say "no", she’d say "no". Well, exactly. A silence is not a no. It's not a no. Take your coffee. - No, I don’t want coffee. - Take it, take your coffee. Clara, the situation here is very clear. There is a person here who made a commitment to something. And I’ve made a commitment, precisely because of her commitment. Yes? So, what do I do? I come all the way here so that that person can do what they have to do. That’s all. That’s all. No... But there are clues! There are all kinds of clues. Like this guy’s car, yes. No, but I have the keys now, yes. No, no, he doesn’t know. No, he doesn’t know a thing. No, to be honest he looks... He looks pretty lost. And Laura… No, it isn’t a mystery. Come on, let’s be logical: she’s indecisive, she wants the position but I’m here in the middle. And for some reason... she doesn’t want to tell me because I’m involved. So we can’t mix the academic side with a situation… Wait! Wait a second! - I’m going to get sugar. - We have to go to Fortín Olavarría. Wait for me a second, please. Can you wait in the car? Yes, here you go. Listen… Clara, to be clear... this isn’t just a professional thing. Yes. That’s why I try not to mix things. You can imagine that I would be… Distraught. Well, yes, I am a little distraught. You know how things are. Academia doesn’t prepare you for sadness. Well, I don’t think it’s a good idea to stay there. No, don’t feel sorry for me either. Well, I’m very grateful to you, Clara. Thank you very much. Let’s do that. We’ll leave now and... I’ll keep you up to speed on how it goes. Perfect. And let’s hope it will be. Let’s hope so. Let’s hope so. OK, thanks! Thanks a million. Bye. Bye. Can you believe that she left the keys with a child? A child? A kid, a little gaucho from the area. A child, yes. But the guy who called me… No. The service station manager called you. Who’s the boy’s dad. Why? No. The service station manager is the service station manager. The kid’s dad left the keys with the manager. And also left your telephone number. On this piece of paper. I imagine you’ll recognise the handwriting. Can I have that? I was told she might be near Fortín Olavarría. Do you know anything about that? PART 1 I THE ADVENTURE I think we’ve gone past it. I know we’ve gone past it. - So what are we doing? - We’re looking for her… They told us to look in Fortín... So we look in Fortín. But like this? In general? Wait here. Hi, good afternoon. How’s it going? Can I ask you something? I’m looking for a friend, who’s probably been here the last few days… I wonder if you recognise her… Let´s see... Ah, wasn’t this girl hanging around here? Ah, yeah? Maybe, but... Did you call there? I called but… He must be taking a nap. - No one came out. - No, but he must be in there. Yes? - But did you see her? - Yes. Thanks. Hi, how are you? How’s it going? - Pleased to meet you. - Pleased to meet you too. Listen, I’m looking for a friend and I’m told... she could have been here, these last few days. She’s my girlfriend, so careful what you say. No, beacuase, you don’t normally get many people round here. But she says she saw her, and maybe you remember… Because the train goes by here, and there aren’t many folk about… Now and again, and the weekend… You know where you can search? She's very similar... Laura clearly was in the village. - The lady saws she saw her. - She saw her? Yes. I showed her the photo… She says that... last week or the one before... a girl was wandering about all afternoon. These are things that people notice more in small towns. Do you have anything to say? Like what? I don’t know. Anything I should know. I don’t think so. Let’s go to Puricelli’s. Who is Puricelli? He’s a guy with a general store. And he rents rooms. "That’s where all the out-of-towners go," the lady said. She said "out-of towners"? She used that word? "Out-of-towners" she said, yes. Laura, an out-of-towner. Did she talk to you about the position? No. She never said anything about the position? I don’t think so. But you worked with her at the council. No. Ah, on the phone you said you did. I said I work for the Council but I don’t work with Laura. I work in another department. What department? Transport. Transport? Transport of materials. You transport stuff? Yes. And how do you know Laura if you transport stuff? Sometimes we were sent together to 30 de Agosto... to La Indiana, or the fields where she worked. So you transported her? Sometimes, yes. Hang on, wait here. - How’s it going? - Hello. Hi, good afternoon. How are you doing? - Rafael, pleased to meet you. - Daniel. Listen Daniel, I'm looking for a friend... from Buenos Aires. She might have come here to make a call. I have a picture here. Let me know if... if you saw her around. No, I haven't seen her around here. She's been trying to communicate, but we don't know where... Where should I keep asking? Maybe in the next general store, near by. - But everything's closed. - No, not here. On the road. OK. Where should I make a turn? Take a left here, and from there... Let's go. We have to go to another general store. And we should start worrying if we find something odd on the way there. Sure. I'll keep you up to speed. Yes. OK, listen. Send kisses to all the boys and girls from the Academia. We’re going to have to wait. Hi. Good afternoon. How’s it going? My name is Rafael. How are you? Listen, I’m looking for a friend. A girl... She’s my girlfriend, actually. We think she might have been here. Do you recognise her? Because she’s… She works in the classification of plants, flowers… Ah, yes. There's a man in América who has... an orchid plantation. - Orchids? - Orchids. - What's this man's name? - Abrante. Give me a moment, please. I'll take note... Abrante. And this is in América, no? FAREWELL, FAREWELL, I’M GOING AWAY. We have to go to América. We have to go and see a man called Abrante. It appears that Laura was here... it looks like they told her about him and I’m sure she went to see him. With all the information I’ve got… I can’t help but think about something. Abrante is an orchid producer. Abrante lives in América. In América is the mark of the one remaining species. Look... You see? Laura still had one species unclassified. PENDING. "Pending." Here’s the thing: Laura committed herself to finishing a job. And that’s exactly what she’s doing. No more, no less. Just finishing a job. She went to América looking for a species she still has to classify… Who knows why the hell… It all adds up. She’s gone crazy. Well, like so many others went crazy: Sinclair, Treviso, Paillán… Franco Vidal himself. You see? They all went after a species that they hadn’t yet classified and threw their lives away looking for it. You follow me? Yeah, more or less. We have to go to América to see Abrante. That’s the answer. Yeah, the thing is... I really… We can’t pass up this opportunity. Laura is lost. Her family are worried. She’s destroying my career. She stole your car. I know one version of Laura... and you know another. There’s no one but us two looking for her. You see? No, you know, like I said... I know, I know. Yes. It’s complicated with the kids, or with your ex. But OK, we’ll work it out. - Now on the way we’ll call… - Viviana. Viviana and we’ll explain to her more or less. Yes? I’m going to use the phone that this Nereo told me he thinks he can get. And I’m going to go to the toilet. You should go too. We’ve got about 25 miles. II EZEQUIEL'S PART God, or bad luck, punishes him by blinding him. Hence the expression ‘Peeping Tom’... which is what they call voyeurs in English. Right, voyeurs... There are a lot of Peeping Toms in this studio... Look at Rodro… They’re all wild with excitement about Lady Godeeva. Thank you one again, Laura, for the section Women Who Made History. Thank you very much. And we are still here in A Sea of News... with Patita's humour and... much more news. Radio is a blind media... Until you watch with your ears. The Station Broadcast. Unique. Just like you. LU 11 invites you to the first Journey to Italy Contest, coordinated with the Trenque Lauquen Culture House. Now, you too can change the course of history. Because traveling is for everyone. Hello. Very good, I was listening. Did you like it? Yes, I didn’t know the story. It’s fun, isn’t it? Very good. Do you have a map or coordinates? No, but we’re going to La Indiana, close to 30 de Agosto. OK. What is it? The farm close to La Querencia? Right. On the way to La Querencia. La Querencia first? You think? OK. It seems like today we are on the subjetcs of nudes… - Who is Anita Ekberg? - La Dolce Vita! Don´t you remember that emblematic scene of her bathing almost naked in the Fontana di Trevi? - Just like Lady Godiva! Naked! - Exactly. Well, then, if the listeners want to participate in the contest... Is it true that she rode naked on horseback? Truly naked? Looks like it. Must be uncomfortable. Yeah. It really must. I don’t want to imagine. And the guy was crazy… Forcing your wife to do that… No, no. Technically he didn’t make her. You reckon it was a game? No, no. What game? She did it so that he’d lower the taxes. What? I reckon it was an erotic game between them. No. The legend says that she sacrificed herself for the people… I reckon it was a game between them. He loved the idea of his wife stark naked on a horse. He had that fantasy. Nonsense. She was into it. They were both kinky. I think it’s you whose making an erotic novel out of it. I think it’s obvious. Well, at least he lowered the taxes. Is that your boyfriend? Your mum? No. My boyfriend. I’ll call him later. OK. He must be missing you, no? Yes. We’re building a house together... so he calls me a lot. There are lots of things to decide on. Actually we’re renovating a house that was my boyfriend’s and now it’s going to be our house. - And it needs everything doing. - Right. Doors, windows… Yes. The colour of the wall in the bedroom. Everything... Yes, I know what you mean. I mean… You go home and you get married. Yes. We’re moving in together, let’s say… RAFA Sorry, I have to get that. Yes, sure.. Take your time. Hello? Yes, I was having lunch. Go on, tell me! Tell me! There he is. - Hi, Hugo. - Hi, Laura. - How are you? - Fine, you? How are you doing, Chicho? Afternoon! How’s it going, Hugo? All good. Here we are. I came here looking for this one I had left. I came to do a last search but… You know, I'm still missing the one that looked like Like Symplocos Uniflora. Look. I was saying to Hugo that it could be in the… Behind la Ollita or in el Molino. Ah, yes, I know the place. Those could be good places. Yes, because we’ve already looked in the bush and nothing. - Coming, Chicho? - No, I'm staying. Do your thing. We found some other things but not that one. It’s playing hard to get. Well, you have one left. - That’s not so bad, is it? - No... Are you busy this afternoon? What do you need? Go and see a farm. - Where? - On route 33. I’ve got a map. An old estate. Martín Fierro, it’s called. Have you heard of it? I think so. I think I can find this there. OK, let’s go. The only thing is I have to pick up the kids. Do you mind going with them? - We found it! - Let's see. It was there on the old map, but not in this one. No, dad! It's in the other direction! Quit it! But we are telling you: it's in the other direction! Quit it! No! No! Sit down. Sit down, I said! - No! - Sit here. I think the Martin Fierro Estate is right there. There. It’s that little house. Is that it? I think so, yes. This estate burned down. They must have got it wrong at the Council… This estate burned down, you are right. Yes. It burned down. Maybe they meant the village of Martín Fierro... No, "Martin Fierro Estate"... Sorry. Were you with the kids? - No, they’re with their mum. - Ah, OK. Here’s the thing. I’ve made a discovery. It’s silly, but... But I wanted to know what you thought. Sure. You might not even be interested. No, I’m sure I’ll be interested. - Is it something to do with flowers? - No. It's something else. I feel like a mad woman. Look. I found this. Letters. Exactly. Letters. I think I’ve become the only witness of a little mystery… Crikey. Yes. I feel like nobody else knows this. Just me. Well. Now you as well... OK. Did you find them at the hotel or what? No. Hang on. Let me explain. I usually go to the library to look for material for the radio, for my guest slot. - Usually the librarian… - Susi. III THE LETTERS AND THE BOOKS Susi! Is there a section on women in science? Any fascicles? - Women scientists? - Yes. There are some things on scientists here. But women scientists… I don’t know if there’s anything. If it even exists. Women scientists? Right. Scientists, yes. But women scientists… who discovered something... Marie Curie. - And the monkey woman? - Who’s that? The one who writes about the chimpanzees. She's very good. Ah, let me see. She must be a scientist… Look, "devoted to science and guided by empirical facts of reality." - She’s like a scientist. - Yes. But lately she hasn’t been finding so much. Different tastes. She says things like Mercedes Sosa, or local things... I’m looking for, you know, more universal things, scientists… Or things that are more unheard of, like Pope Joan, the Queen of Sheba, Mata Hari… - Mata Hari’s very good. - Yes, Mata Hari’s very good. And the local ones... Alfonsina Storni, Evita, Mercedes Sosa… Shall I get you the biographies that we have? - OK. - Pepe! We’ve got some. If you like I can set them apart. You can then check them. If it helps, you keep it... One day Susi got together all the biographies of women that there were in the library. I took them to the hotel. I started to read. Nothing convinced me very much… until I came across the Russian woman. A woman called Alexandra Kollontai. And the book was called "Autobiography of a Sexually Emancipated Woman". - What’s the book about? - It’s an autobiography... - Of a sexually emancipated woman… - Right. Anyway, I thought it would be good to do the guest slot and also I really liked how she wrote. Right. What most caught my attention was one aspect of the edition: every time Kollontai referred to a personal achievement... there was a footnote by the editor saying that Kollontai at the last minute had asked to turn the first personal singular into the first person plural. That is, every time the "I" had to be replaced with "We". Sorry. What was that again? - The "I" had to be replaced by "we". - Ah, OK. The funny thing is that I then came across the notes that someone who had also read the book had made and they were surprised at this same aspect of the edition as I was. That thing of changing "I" to "We." That interested me: someone had read the book and agreed with me. Maybe at another time, in another place. ... BY US... You lost me a bit with that last bit… No, don’t worry. That doesn’t matter. The thing is that we had both been struck by the same thing. Both? Yes, the two of us. Hang on... AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A SEXUALLY EMANCIPATED WOMAN. At the start of the book there was a stamp that said "Martín Fierro Estate". And under that a note that said: "Carmen Zuna, read for the first time in September 1962". The ink from this Carmen Zuna seemed to be the same ink from the underlining that I found throughout the book. Martín Fierro Estate… Yes. I lied to you. It wasn’t for work. It was espionage. OK. So this book belonged to this Zuma... - Zuna. - Zuna. Yes, but anyway. That isn’t important all the same. When I got half way through the book... I found that the pages jumped from 45 to 50. And then I realised that between those pages that were stuck together intentionally... there was something. A letter. A love letter. Yes... Yes. The letter was addressed to her. To Carmen Zuna. That was the first letter I found. And then I realised... that it wasn't the first letter between them. That it was part of a correspondence that had started earlier… The letter I found is dated 1962 and signed by someone called Paolo Bertino. - Paolo Bertino… - Yes, Paolo Bertino. The Bertinos are Italian, they had land here. Exactly. In fact, I think there are some left. Yes, yes. A few. And what were the letters about? I’ll tell you later. But were they love letters? Yes, yes. Well... The thing is that this is where the bees come into it. The book about bees. The letter ended with a promise to send a new book in which another letter was going to be hidden. And it referred to the "universe of the bees." There I figured out that this whole correspondence... all the letters from Paolo and Carmen... could be among the thousands of books in Trenque Lauquen Library. But I only had to find them. And to do that I had something, I had a clue: The clue that the same letter was giving me. Do you see? I think so. The clue was the bees. Exactly! Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. "Autobiography of a woman"… No, I’m keeping that one. Kollontai, not here. Susi, can I ask you a question? Is there a record of donations? Does that appear anywhere? Hang on a second because this is… I get lost. What is it you want? I want to know something, about a collection… - Which? - Martín Fierro. - Martín Fierro Estate? - Yes. That’s an enormous collection. Now, as for women and women scientists and all that, forget it… No, no… It’s not that. It’s because I was intrigued because I found a stamp that… OK, hang on a second. I went back to the library. I asked Susi to let me see the whole record of donations that were in the library. Could we see the records of donations? OK. Is the ladder safe? I mean, it won't kill us… OK, we’re coming now. Come with me. Among the thousands of cards, I found a Martín Fierro Estate collection. And then I started to look to see if there was something to do with the universe of the bees. Bees... 120... THE LIFE OF BEES. - And? - I found one. "The Life of Bees." - Good! - Yes. I found it in the children’s section. And mind you, it isn't a children’s book. When I opened the book, there was no letter but there was a note with a page number and several pages torn out. I started to look for all the books that had Carmen Zuna’s signature... which because of the stamp had been archived in the Martín Fierro Estate Collection. So I realised that all of Carmen’s books had ended up in the hands of the Bertinos or who knows where. But did no one ever find the letters? It doesn't look like it. THE PERSONALITY OF ANIMALS THE GREEK CITY Italy. Rome. Letters that come and go between Trenque Lauquen and various Italian cities. Several from Rome, some from Turin. A lot from Quincinetto and Scalaro, I didn’t even know where they were. “This is what I offer to you, love letters, coming and going. It starts thus…” I found a letter in every book. I put together a map with all this. I classified them, I ordered them by date, I studied them. I read all the books. Well, not all of them... Hang on, hang on. Sorry. - Can I ask some questions? - Yes. Apart from finding all those letters… Which is no small thing… Hidden correspondence among thousands of books. - Amazing. - Yes. So... What? That's what I'm asking you: what? What? Well… Let me put it another way. Why are you so interested in all this? I mean… Apart from the thousand books… What's the mystery? Read this. Out loud? Please. "Carmen: I feel swept away. I feel like until yesterday I was a child, and that you have made me an adult. Something has just begun. I have lost my virginity again... this time definitively. All the women I have been with before... the woman to whom I was married for over ten years... every one of my many lovers, appear before me like little girls. Your vagina, Carmen. Your vagina. Someone has given me a treasure map, and I have started to explore it. I want to return to your vagina again and again. Immerse myself in it, give my life to it. If I could live there, Carmen... if that devouring sex would accept me as a permanent inhabitant... I would, after so many years, finally be happy. My phallus is a poor innocent. A poor blind man who has entered the jungle and cannot now leave. I am crying. I am a castaway. I am lost. Paolo." The mystery is her. Carmen Zuna. Unbelievable. Yes. "Dear Carmen: Yesterday I thought about you all day." - He dropped the formalities. - Yes. "That little hotel room, that staircase... that table, will be little sanctuaries for me, little temples." Hang on... Interesting. A lot of information. Yes. We know that they met in a hotel. But the staircase... Who knows why he says that. Maybe they always started on the staircase… On the staircase of the hotel? You think? I wouldn't be surprised. What I don't understand is the table. Why does he mention the table? "The table. That little wooden table... and you on top of it. Your eye, waiting, open like…" "Your eye waiting open like an orange…" Ah, OK… "I want the summer to come now. Please, beloved Carmen, let us meet again. Let us set a time and place for our next encounter. There I will be, always yours. Paolo." "Carmen: I apologise." He goes back to the formality. "The student was not up to the task. I failed. I failed you, and I deserve punishment. I was foolish, I was weak. To see you in that man’s arms, to see that man possess you... to see you aroused, panting, screaming, surrendered... rude. Burning like a fire for that coarse man, that brutish, rough man... for that animal who did not and could not know who he had in his arms was too much for me. The image tortured me and continues to torture me. There I was, sitting, watching you... The gaucho, watching me... Laughing at me as he possessed you. And you, Carmen, your happiness, your fury, your laughter... looking at me contentedly like a child." Blimey. "I don't know if I will be able… I don't know if I will be able to continue my education. I don't know if this art is for me. I don't know if I'm any use to you. If I can cope with your fire, my lady, my queen, my priestess. I am worse than you. I do not deserve any of you, Carmen. Nor do I deserve to be humiliated by you. Paolo." - This is getting a bit weird. - Yes. What do you make of it? Her ladyship took the gaucho to the stud farm. You think she’s a landowner? I don’t know. That seems to be the case, doesn’t it? Yes. - Shall we go? - Yes. "Carmen, my beloved. A short note on this windy afternoon. I'm so aroused that I don't know where to begin. I feel like I am being examined on a new subject. I write you letters and tear them up. I can't find the words. I don't recognise my handwriting on the paper. Could it be that I am terrified by the idea of losing my place in your heart? Whatever it is, I cannot wait. I know he will be received as one of us." I honestly don't understand a thing. "Whatever it is, I cannot wait... I know he will be received as one of us. And you Carmen? When will I see you again? Will it be soon? I miss you more than ever. Paolo." "Dear Carmen: I no longer know why I write to you. Three months have passed since you left. Where are you? Who could you be with? Who is in the place where I was for so many years? Was it that easy to replace me?' "Carmen, I no longer know where I find the strength to write to you... but I feel that it is the only thing I can do. I am not resigned to this being a farewell. Oh Carmen, oh my traveller, oh my adventurer, don't leave me this way! After abandoning everything, this fire has left too many wounds. - He left his wife? - Well, yeah. - Paolo was married. - Of course. Then I remember that your body is the map of my life, and without your body I am lost. Your letters reach me from the most remote places. And your words become equally remote and vague. Could it be that you wrote them thinking they would be your last? I cannot accept that. I deny those words, I impugn them. They are the words of a little girl. A little girl who repeats mechanically the cruel verses of infantile games. But you are not a little girl, Carmen. And this is not a game. Yours, Paolo." He's losing her. Yes. I don't know why he insists so much on the words. What words? "They are the words of a little girl. A little girl who repeats mechanically." What could that be? I'm leaving you! To me, it sounds like a pat-a-cake. I leave you, I leave you, I ditch you, I ditch you... I kill you, I kill you, I bury you, I bury you... Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye! I don't know. What do you think she said to him? - Bye, bye? - Bye, bye. Bye, bye, goodbye? Farewell, farewell? - I’m leaving! - I'm leaving. Farewell, farewell, I'm going away. Yes, that sounds mechanical. Yes. If you find yourself regretting I’m leaving, I’m leaving Having given your love Farewell, farewell It wasn’t my fault I’m leaving, I’m leaving You gave me the chance Farewell, farewell Jealousy weighs down on me I don’t know why IV "FAREWELL, FAREWELL, I’M GOING AWAY" All right, Abrante, thanks. So I come out here where I came in and straight ahead to Piedritas? Yes, yes. Straight ahead, you’ll see a sign. OK? I’m in a hurry. Excuse me. No, no. Please. Thank you. Thank you very much. Bye. Nothing, mate. This Abrante hasn’t got a clue. He doesn’t know anything about Laura... or who this guy in the bar is... He doesn’t know a thing. He hasn’t had any orchids for ten years. He doesn’t know anything about plants. Now he has sows. Mothers. 3 months, 3 weeks and 3 days. In 114 days they get 8 to 12 suckling pigs. So each sow could have up to… About 30 suckling pigs a year. Ten mothers... 300 a year. Every suckling pig is 10 kilos, more or less 5000, 5500 pesos. Good business, no? What Abrante did tell me... is that there’s a big nature reserve near here, near Piedritas. Maybe there is the thing we’re looking for. Laura? Not exactly. Laura’s unclassified species. I think that could lead us to Laura. Do you remember when the last time was that you saw her exactly? I'm not sure. Evidently with the car thing... Ah, sure. When she came to borrow the car. And when she stole your car... Sorry, but I don't feel like she stole my car. Well... OK. - You drove her around, right? - Yes. OK. How often? Do you remember how often? Once or twice a week. It depended on the work she had to do. What was that like? Tell me the routine… Did you meet at the council? I usually picked her up at the radio. The radio? She worked at a radio station. Who? Laura... Laura worked at a radio station? She had a guest spot on a programme. Juliana's programme. Listen, did she tell you anything about me? I mean, did she tell you she had a boyfriend? - Yes, she told me. - OK. OK. So, the radio… Yes. Carry on. I used to pick her up at the radio... we'd go to the farm where she had to work... Sometimes we had lunch... then I left her at the hotel. That's all. Right. Right. That job was the first step to being appointed… as department head. We were joint chair. I was the head, she hasn’t been appointed yet… She was about to be appointed… Right. I mean, if she did that job well, the position was confirmed… Right. That's why I don't understand what's going on. Right. Can you tell me the name of the radio? L, U. L for "Laura", U for "unicorn"... 11. OK. Let's go. You drive, I’m tired. What happened? Flat tyre. OK, let’s get the jack. - No. - No what? No, I haven’t got one. What? I've just realised, the day Laura borrowed the car... I took all the things out of the boot to clean it and left it all at my house. No, I don't understand. You go driving in the country without a jack? I’ll remind you that it wasn't in my plans to drive here. I have the worst luck! We’ll call the breakdown service. You sure about the jack? You don’t want to check just in case? I’m sure, but I’ll check. See? Is that’s Laura’s backpack? Call the breakdown service, please. OK. They’ll be here in an hour, hour and a half. "Autobiography of a sexually emancipated woman." Crikey. So I can get some sleep... Hey, could you give me a wake-up call at quarter to five? Yes, of course. Girls, do you want to watch TV in the kitchen? I’ll set my phone all the same… but if I don't hear it I prefer to be woken by a professional. Can I get breakfast at that time? I'll find out, Sir. If it's very complicated: A coffee, something quick... so I don't have to go out on an empty stomach. - Yes, sir. We'll get you a coffee. - Thanks, very kind. Don’t worry about my friend here, he’ll probably keep on sleeping. - Thank you, thanks a lot. - You're welcome. - Mum, can we watch TV? - In a minute. When? In a minute when I’ve finished clearing the table. - Good morning. - Morning. - Will you have breakfast? - Yes. Excuse me. Could I have some more croissants please? But the butter ones. I have sweet or savoury. Is that ok? Sweet. Sweet. - Did you sleep well? - Yeah, yeah... Good. You didn’t shower? - No. - The shower’s great. Just so you know… There’s a lot to do. I was at the nature reserve this morning. Very nice reserve, very well maintained, there was nothing there. Not a trace. Not a trace of the unclassified species, not a trace of Laura. There wasn't even a trace of the women who were working there. Thank you. So they sent me back here, to América. To a municipal plant nursery. They wanted to send me to a zoo. Nothing. There’s nothing. The thing is something else. The news of the day is here. "Man has always tried to impose his ego on us women and adapt us completely to his ends. Thus, despite everything, the inevitable inner rebellion broke out because love became a prison." I'll read you another one. "I had to go, I had to break with the chosen man, as otherwise... this was a subconscious feeling... I would have exposed myself to the danger of losing my independent existence." One more… Underlined with pen. "The decrease in our capacity to work was lost in sterile emotional experiences." And the ink matches the piece of paper where she wrote down your telephone number. The piece of paper she left at the service station. It's clear what is happening here. Laura was making a house with me. She was about to take a position in my department. It isn't that Laura's gone crazy. It's just that she's got cold feet. Cold feet? About what? In general. Love or work. A man or an independent life. A career... Laura needs to find that unclassified species. Work out the enigma. And feel... like she did it herself. That no one worked it out for her. That I didn't work it out for her. Only then will she be able to return to her usual life. It's all here. In this book. Rafael... I need us to go back to Trenque. See the people who were close to this Laura. I need you to come with me. I'm going to pay for the hotel. And pick up some regional products that I bought on the excursion this morning. Shall I see you in the car? I've already got petrol. Excuse me, could I check out? - Yes, certainly. - Thank you. I'm going to the restroom. I'm leaving the credit card here. Something I’ve never wanted Is having ever been ungrateful That’s why I’ve never forgotten How much you’ve been there for me I could say that you and I We’ve been good friends I don’t know if it’s fate That parts the ways You always go in such a hurry Hiding in your laughter Maybe you never understood That I move slowly and sadly I offered you my soul sincerely And you weren’t even capable of taking my hand I don’t know if it was in vain I could hardly say that you feel it with sorrow And don’t ask why There’s no sense in knowing Just sit in silence beside me And don’t ask after me when I’m gone V THE ROADS LOVE LETTERS PROPOSAL MARTIN FIERRO ESTATE I / WE BEES (NO LETTER) NO CLUES “WHO HAS CHILDREN ACCEPTS LIFE” PAGE 48. PAVESE, LE AMICHE NO REPLY WALKING MY ANSWER IS JUANA It's the only note from Carmen signed by her. I don't understand how I missed that detail. If there is a note from Carmen among Carmen’s things... it's because this note was never sent. And it's because this name, Juana... represents something that she wanted to omit. Something that she thought, wrote, but then didn't send. Mysterious, huh? Is it the only time she’s mentioned? Yes, the only time. There's something curious about the Juanas… There's a book about Joan of Arc, one about Sister Juana Inés de la Cruz. And the book about Joan of Arc is also translated by a Juana, Juana Castro. Right. Right... - A thousand Juanas. - Yes. I don’t know. Just to bear it in mind. Maybe it'll help us to think. Right. Right... - What's up? - Nothing. - What's up? - Nothing. I found something. - Carmen Zuna. - No! The first thing that caught my attention about Carmen is that no one knew her. I grew up in this town. Everyone knows each other. A woman like that would never go unnoticed. Even less with Carmen’s profile. How could it be that no one noticed her? It had to be someone who came to the town now and again. A doctor, who came to work at the hospital. Or a nun. But at that time there were no convents. I looked in all the registers I could find. Locals guide, Kraft guide... phone book, book of trades... professional services, electoral registers. Not a trace. Until I had a revelation. An intuition. Since they played so much with the idea of the student, the teacher, learning... - Perhaps I had to go and see… - You went to the school? School Number 1. I’m a former student. At the school I met everyone. Chicho! Long time no see! Tito the caretaker. Lelia, my second grade teacher. Graciela, the librarian... and Mary, the principal. I asked them if they had a file from that time... From 1960. I didn't tell them exactly what it was for. I simply said that I was interested in the school’s file. The first thing they showed me was a picture from "The Golden Decade". It was the era of the great schools. I found that the teaching stuff from '60 to '70 were outstanding. In those ten years, the teachers were almost all eminences. It was the time of the great schools, I'm told. Do you know who all of them are? Some, yes. This is Ana María Sastre. The thing is that Tito, Graciela, Mary and Lelia... spent some time putting names to the teachers. They recognised them all. Ana María Sastre, Leoncia Garro... Silvina San Miguel, "la Bergamasco"... Ulda Saenz de Fosatti... Piaggio, Trotta, Barragué, Muñiz. They all have a name. Longobardi… And this one… Who is that one, because this one we know up to here, but that one? I don't remember that one. I can't place her. No. The other ones, yes. Everyone had a name except one. - Beatriz Del Sarto. - Del Sarto... - And this one? - Is she Barragé? Hey, what about this one with the long hair? Isn't she the same one we don't know from there? It was always the same woman: a teacher who they couldn't place at all. This is the same photo from… This is the photo from there. Exactly, it's the same person. The magazine of the school’s centenary. Look, 100 years. This same photo even appears in the magazine of the school’s centenary. Let's see if we can find her here. With all the names of all the teachers, except hers. But you see, here is she is. Ah, look. It’s the same photo. There she is. Garro, Scuderi, San Miguel... I have a hypothesis. - Teresa Trotta… - Yes. Piaggio... If they all have a name except one… And this one? Is Carmen Zuna. Carmen Zuna was a teacher. - Supply teacher. - How do you know? I checked in all the registers from '60 to '70. Once a month a signature appears and, beside it: Supply. The name never appears. I started to ask questions. Specifically I asked them about Zuna. Do you know a "Carmen Zuna"? No... I don't. Mary says "It doesn’t sound familiar." I asked her about the supply teachers at that time. She tells me there were several. I ask her: where did they come from? She says... Well, most of them from La Pampa. "Almost all of them from La Pampa, from Santa Rosa". Right, you went to Santa Rosa and looked for the records of Zuna as a supply teacher who came from Santa Rosa when a teacher was absent. No. I asked Grace, at the council and she looked for it on the internet. - And? - Carmen Zuna. But the photo was the same as this one? No, there wasn’t a photo. But all the same: There was a teacher called Zuna. Supply teacher. In that photo everyone has a name. There is only one who doesn't have a name. - I think it's clear… - Yes, it's clear. - Carmen Zuna! - Yes, yes. VI CARMEN ZUNA - There's something else. - What? I looked at the records of students from '65 to '69 at the school. And? Mario and Marcelo Bertino. - She was the sons’ supply teacher. - Exactly! Mario and Marcelo Bertino. - Do you have any more photos? - Yes, keep looking. Is this her? That's her. OK… But wait, wait. This gets better. I carried on reading the letters you gave me. From the first half of the year, Bertino is the same as before. He's like a kind of lover who is learning. She is his teacher. But at one moment something happens. An event. In the letters he starts to sound worried. He starts to speak about someone else. He says: "He will be received like one of us." Who is he? Is it the gaucho? From the stud farm? At one stage, she leaves. He keeps writing letters to her, completely despairing... but she disappears. He blames the other one. He feels that she abandoned him for the other. But at the same time he can't speak about the other one with hatred. As if he too loved that other one. There are three, and the two of them love Zuna. And Carmen... Who does she love? Time passes. Finally, in the last letters, Zuna reappears. And listen to this: He is no longer he. He is she. The third party is now female. That's as far as I've got. Can you hold on while I go to the toilet? Clearly, there is an event. But it is not a lover. Look at this photo. It is from late '68, a few months before Carmen disappeared off the map. So? Her face has changed. - Does she look sad? - Tired, maybe? She’s fatter. - She’s pregnant. - A daughter? Juana. It’s like this… The letters from '69 reconstruct all the mystery of '68. At some stage in '68, as you read, Carmen gets pregnant by Bertino. Suppose Bertino receives the news of the pregnancy while in Italy, on a business trip. Bertino doesn’t understand, he doesn’t know what to do. At first, he writes things like: “I will take care of everything”, "Don't be afraid", "You are not alone." Comments of a married man to his lover in this situation. He wants to behave like an adult. I guess he found leaving his family a scandalous thing. But an answer from Carmen, we don’t know which one is, surprises him. Something happens. Something changes within him. For example, look at what he writes in this letter: “Your answer has given me hope. I never thought having a child with me was a possibility for you, in the same way a Goddess doesn’t have a child with a simple mortal.” That’s the sort of things he writes. He’s out of control. In love as he has never been before. And he refers to that child as a miracle, a present form destiny. That kind of cliché. And that’s where the problem begins: Carmen's letters stop arriving. Nevertheless, Bertino keeps writing to her. He keeps the ritual going... a little resigned. For long months, apparently, Carmen doesn’t reply. Nothing, not a single letter, not a single word. Bertino suffers, fears, waits. Finally Carmen’s long-awaited letter arrives. And what can be read in that letter is even more disturbing for Bertino. Once again, Carmen doesn’t behave as he expects. Something is off. Carmen announces she’s leaving. Where? I don’t know. And Bertino doesn’t know either. Carmen simply tells him that: I’m leaving. What I understand is that Carmen starts to walk… What do you mean to walk? To walk across the fields… How do you know she starts to walk across the fields? How could you know that? He says he doesn’t know where she is. He wants to find out, but in the end he gives up. He tells her: “After days of trying to find out where you are, I’ve realized you are nowhere. Or rather: you are everywhere.” I don't buy it. Wait! She starts walking. There are more clues. Which clues? Look at these letters. If you follow what he says it is as if she has become a wild creature, almost an animal. He writes things like: “Pilgrim of the pampas”, “lonesome explorer”, “adventurer”. Even "vagabond"… Carmen, a vagbond... - He writes "vagabond"? - Many times. OK. Let’s picture this. Carmen walks the province of Buenos Aires for months, as her belly grows. It’s as if he’s seeing her: walking along dirt roads, walking into a farm every once in a while, to ask for food. Alone, somewhat lost. But at the same time determined not to turn back. And Bertino? Bertino meanwhile is in Italy. All his letters are stamped there: from a remote village where he takes refuge. And there he stays. Bertino waits for her. He knows about the pregnancy. That pregnancy is what Bertino tries to imagine in his letters. Where is she? Where is she going? Is she okay? Does she know what she’s doing? Or has she gone crazy? What is she worried about? Is she worried about something? Will she return? At that time he thought it was going to be a boy. Look, he writes: "He will be received like one of us". He confirms to her that he will be there with her... to look after him. But it doesn’t seem to be enough. Something in Carmen has changed. Something’s happened to her. He fears for her. He is afraid that she is lost. Carmen replies only sporadically. And, from what Bertino says in his letters, her notes are erratic and bitter. But Carmen is all right. She is better than ever. She has found on that walk something that she had always looked for… For some reason, she cannot stop walking. She crosses the whole province and does not tire. She walks so much, she even reaches the sea. And there she stays, waiting. Let's suppose that some time later, at some seaside town, the baby girl is born. Thanks. "My answer is Juana" is the answer to why she gives up the life with him. That life full of love and adventures. That life is no longer possible. And there is no way they can be the same again... love each other equally. The letters from Paolo from that period are the letters of a sad man. He misses her. He thinks about her all the time. He travels here and there, like a lonely shadow. He thinks about her, as he travels around Italy as if trying to find something. As if he were trying to replace her. And this is were a new mystery appears. Listen... At some stage, I don’t know how, Juana appears in Italy, living with her father, with Bertino. "We continue to wait for you here, Carmen. Always in the same place," he tells her in one of his last letters. How does she get there? How is it that Carmen lets the girl go? Does she abandon her? Do Carmen and Bertino meet again? If they don’t, how does the girl travel to Italy? Here we are at the very heart of the enigma. The great mystery of the love story between Bertino and Carmen Zuna… Juana. - "The answer is Juana." - The question is Juana. The girl grows up. He raises her on his own. She is the only thing that keeps him close to her. The only guarantee that Carmen might return one day. And then what happens? I don't know. All we know is that at some point he returns... and almost like a ceremony, like a ritual, he leaves the letters in the same place. He knows that she will not return... but he prefers that the letters are there: in the same place where I found them. He writes letters to nobody? Something like that. Bertino talks about her as if she has got lost on the roads. He accepts that she will not return. Did Carmen go crazy? Or is it he who went crazy? Imagining her as a kind of legendary character? That is something we will never know. What we do know is that they did not see each other again. And he never stops thinking about her. His life is her. And he thinks about the years they spent together... as the only moment when his life made sense. VII RAFAEL'S PART ...Rome is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, right? - You had already gone. - No, we hadn't Juliana... And we loved it. It was like a dream to us. When I was a boy they spoke to me a lot in Italian, because my family was Italian. So I was able to communicate. I was able to be in contact, let's say... What do you want me to say? I can't explain it either, Clarita. I don't know. No, no. Rude. Chip on his shoulder. No, whatever you like, but you just don’t do that. You don’t leave someone stranded in Piedritas... You just don’t do that. No, no! That’s right. He hates me. I said: he hates me. He hates me! Nothing, nothing. Don’t worry, Clarita. I’ll call you when I arrive. See if you can arrange that ticket for me. I said check… The ticket… I said… I said check… Nothing.... Bye. Bye. Bye. Yes. Let's go to a commercial break and we'll be right back with "A Sea of News". Radio is a blind media... Unil you watch with your ears... The Station Broadcast. Unique. Just like you. Hello. How can I help you? Hello, yes. Norma? Normita… Ah, how are you? I’m Rafael. Rafael? I'm the person who you arranged Laura’s transfer with. Laura? She's... Laura? Ah! Laura! Of course! Laura! Sorry… Sit down, I'm a bit disoriented… wrestling with this wrapping paper to wrap this for my godson. Rafael! We know each other well but by email! Yes. But not in person... You received the project completed and signed by me, didn't you? Perfect, yes. Would you like anything, a coffee or something? No, thank you. I'm fine. And what brings you here? - Here we are… - Is something the matter? No, no... Truth is... I just wanted to come in person, to see to some matters that Laura kind of left in a mess. - You're her partner, aren’t you? - Exactly. You're getting married. We're moving in together. Right, that’s right. Well, it’s the same… Yes, it’s the same. - Sure you don’t want coffee, nothing? - No, no. Thank you. Actually I wanted to ask you if you remember the last time you saw Laura. Laura? Has something happened to her? No. Not at all. Thing is... She went on holiday and after a while I didn't hear from her, but it's nothing… That's odd. She came to the council to finish her job. She signed everything. Did she complete everything all right? Yes, fine. She did an excellent job. Great. The team adored her. But I think she was missing something, she said to me… She finished everything and I speeded things up so that they could advance with the university position. Right. I'm very grateful to you... I don't know. She surveyed one last field and she told me that she would take care of the remaining one and that in any case she would come back. I don't exactly remember what we agreed. Right... - The unclassified specimen. - Sorry? The unclassified specimen, the remaining one. Ah, yes. A pending one. The pending one. That’s what it says on the file. Yes, but that’s just bureaucracy. "The" pending one, "the" remaining one... Right. You don't remember how long she stayed in the hotel? This is very strange... Have you been jilted? Did she go off with a local man? No, no, not at all. I have to take precise information for the department and now Laura doesn't… A load of things. How strange! She has a ticket. - Who? - Laura. She bought a ticket… For Monday. And how do you know? Because I'm her boss. She's going to come back. Don't worry. No, yeah. I know she's going to come back. Have you fallen out? No… Now that I think about it, maybe there was a small misunderstanding, but... I think I will have a tea now. Look... No, I know what you're going to say, but it isn't that. Laura doesn't do things like that. She hasn't left me for someone else. So wait for her, she'll be back. Thanks. What I wanted to tell you is something else... Laura did a very good job… I know… But at the end she went off the tracks. She went off the tracks? Yes. Maybe it’s nothing but... she forgot to pay for some things in the hotel… A bit irresponsible. Sloppy, you know. A lot of minibar, a lot of room service… And she didn’t even say, if she’d told us we’d have fixed it… Of course. Needless to say I can take care of that. And I apologise on behalf of the whole department. She became an unfriendly character, you know? So she had to leave Trenque... and I don't know why but she decided to stay a few more days but the council couldn't keep paying for the hotel because her contract had already ended. So, being so friendly... I offered her a room that my grandmother rents out. And not only did she not pay her... but she didn't even leave her a box of chocolates. My grandmother is retired, you know. Well, once again... I'll be sure to get a good gift for your grandmother. She took a pair of wellies of mine as well, and a raincoat… A Perramus. I'd like to offer to pay for that as well, Norma. She became quite rebellious. She left the room in a mess. We had to call someone to clean it... And she had set up a kind of dirty and smelly habitat… What about her things? No, she took them, I suppose. And the rest was returned. What do you mean returned? To the library. She went to the library a lot because she had a radio programme, you see? Yes, yes… And there were maps and things of the council… But all that was returned as well. Right, you returned it. No, Chicho returned it. - Who’s Chicho? - Chicho, the transport guy... Ah, yes… Chicho. Yes, I know who you mean. I'm going to have to get going because my coach is leaving. You're leaving already? Yes, I didn't even bring any clothes. I came for the day and ended up staying. OK, but you’ll be back. Sure. Yes, sure. Besides, if Laura doesn't come back in a couple of days maybe I'll start to get worried... I don’t think so. She’ll be back. Yes, of course she’s coming back. Shall I take you to the bus station? I’m at a loose end. And I’ll drop off this gift for my nephew. Go on, go on. Go on, that's handy. - Can I help you with that? - OK. You already know the town hall… It’s a monstrosity… This is where Lau started working. And this is the main street… Villegas. You see how it’s a boulevard? Well, all the streets in Trenque are boulevards. This was “the” bar for Laura. This is Kalos. She came here a lot. She spent her time here. I guess she used it as her office… Right. This is where Laura moved to when she left the hotel… Right. This is my grandma Telma’s house. The one with the bench. As I said, that’s where she left all her things. Looks like a UFO. Yes… A flying saucer. More boulevards… All boulevards. This is the lake. Trenque Lauquen means "round lake." You see that room with the blind up? Laura stayed there for the first six months that she was working in Trenque. Your coach to Buenos Aires is here. Give her time, Rafa. Maybe she's confused. Yes. Maybe I'll get home and she'll be waiting for me there. It goes without saying that I can sign the completion of the project... take responsibility for the remaining one. I don't know, I can also send someone to finish this business next week... so it isn't left half done. No, don't worry, Rafael, thank you. Besides, the project is on hold and we won't get another allocation of money for it. No, of course, yes. This has been a tough year. All the budget cuts went to health when the monkey thing happened. And now with the elections and the re-election of Pérez Fox you can't sell a project to classify local flowers to anybody. Not a soul… What’s the monkey thing? The monkey thing… Well, I call it the monkey thing. Didn't you read the news about an apparition on the lake, a while back? No, no. I'm not aware of it. This thing appeared and we don't know what it was, on the lake in the park… there were thousands of theories. The whole business with a doctor from here who was kind of controversial who took it to her house… Madness. - And what happened? - Nothing… It died down in the end. It was a big fuss until it got out hat it was a fairly normal animal. An alligator or something. An alligator? Alligators here? It was a scandal. There was this whole science fiction story... and then they said it was all a trick, a screen. A trick? Yes. To keep people entertained and scared while the lake was taken over in a privatisation project. An artificial beach. An artificial beach in Trenque Lauquen... - With artificial waves. - No... Nothing new, Pérez Fox’s idea. It’s leaving now. Well, nice to meet you. Likewise. Yes… Keep me updated and let me know. If you come I’ll book you a hotel through the council. Ah, OK. Sure, sure, of course. Wel... - Very nice to meet you. - Likewise. - Bye. - Bye. Thank you. Good journey! PART II "Towns falling apart, politicians not doing their jobs" by Juliana Verdi.

Good afternoon. This is a new edition of "A Sea of News". One again, we are on from the floor of Radio LU11... and we apologize for the customary delay. Here we are alongside our team, our friends, our listeners. Meeting once again to start the day with news,entertainment... and above all, looking forward to sharing this place... to talk with all the Trenque Lauquen community. Today we have with us our good friend from Buenos Aires: Laurita. - Our almost biologist, no? - Almost, yes. She is going to give us a surprise section, from what it says here. Right? We also have... Curcio on sport. Today: historical section on shot put... And it's... Well... - It's relationship with... - OK, very good. And our dear Patita. With her motley characters that... bring us toghether, move us, make us laugh and cry... And we hope she’s brought more characters, right? Did the fortune teller come? Seems like it! OK, alright... And let’s get going, yeah? Rodro, from the control room there, always dependable... We’re going to start off with an upbeat subject about the work that is being done in the lake complex that you all know very well, in the area of Route 33... which is causing so many arguments over the construction of a dam. We hope that this afternoon the town’s mayor Francisco Pérez Fox will be coming to see us. He promised he would, but you never know... He'll be here. Of course. The mayor is a busy man. We’re now going to interview Marta Rípodas... director of the play that opens tonight at the Municipal Theatre of Trenque. A beautiful theatre, a wonderful place to go. But also tonight... is the presentation of Marta’s company, which is called “Theatre a priori", who are tonight performing an interpretation of "Waiting for Godot" by Samuel Beckett... Starring parents and children. Marta is travelling to Trenque and we’ve got her on the line now... How’s it going, Marta? Hello Juliana. Can you hear me? OK, and here it is now... our section on Women Who Made History. A classic section for all of us. We hope Laurita never leaves Trenque... She couldn’t be replaced, right? No, please. I hope I won't be! So tell us, then, Laurita... almost biologist? Almost, almost. I'm getting there. OK, almost biologist. What have you brought us this morning? I’ve brought a character who’s going to cause a little bit of controversy, I know. She's done it before. Her name is Lady Godeeva. - Lady Godeeva, right. - I think it's pronounced Lady “Godiva”... No, Godeeva is fine. - Yes, I say Godeeva. - Godeeva works. OK, Laura... Tell us who this woman is who made history… OK. First and foremost, we could say that she's the most famous nudist of all time. Whoa, good start. Nudist? Nudist, exhibitionist, whatever you want to call her. We go back to the Middle Ages, specifically the eleventh century, England. When we think about the Middle Ages, we have to imagine what that means to us: the castle, the feudal lord… - The vassals... - That’s the scene. Lady Godeeva was married to this Leofric, who was Lord of the city of Coventry. Godeeva was well liked by the people for her goodness and beauty... And she was very popular at a time when the class differences were more marked than ever. Leofric, on the other hand... was a tough lord, pretty tyrannical. The people didn't like him at all... A male chauvinist, no? In a moment of shortages he decided to increase taxes which would literally leave the city on the verge of starvation. The people begged Leofric to show mercy, but he could not be moved. It was then that the traders and the poor turned to Lady Godeeva hoping she would be able to convince her husband into lowering the taxes. Lady Godeeva stands up to her husband, but he won't come around. Mocking her request, Leofric offers a deal. He says "OK, I'll lower the taxes, but on one condition: you shall ride a horse through the town of Coventry, naked." - Woah... - Some kind of sexaholic. Rodro’s already googling it… Imagine... What a pervert. I find him very perverse. Now imagine how scandalous this would be today... To have the First Lady wonder around the streets naked... Yes. Perhaps some gril from Trenque Lauquen could do the same, no? - Maybe that inspires the mayor... - Right. - A listener, perhaps? - We should start a casting... That could work. - Top shelf, you might say. - That's it! Top shelf. Now imagine this in the middle ages... OK. So Lady Godeeva takes up the challenge. The matter is announced... It seems that until the last minute Leofric believed she wouldn’t keep her promise... but the time comes, Lady Godiva saddles up her horse and rides completely naked through the streets of Coventry. Good job, Lady. But the most moving thing is that the people, who know that Lady Godiva is making this sacrifice for them, decide to close the windows, draw all the curtains, and no one sees her. So the sacrifice isn’t so great... as she rode naked through the empty streets of Coventry. We shouldn't detract from it either, right? She rode a horse, naked... That is true, yes. She also made Leofric lower the taxes. - Well done, Leofric. - It has to be said... Nice one, Leofric. Well done. Sorry. One last detail! The legend goes that only one of the inhabitants of Coventry, a man called Tom, couldn’t resist and spied on Lady Godeeva when she went past his house. So the gods, or bad luck, or who knows what... punished him by blinding him. That’s how we get the phrase “Peeping Tom"... which is the English word for what we call “voyeurs.” Right, voyeurs. There are a lot of Peeping Toms in this studio. Look at Rodro. They’re all wild with excitement about Lady Godeeva. Thank you one again, Laura, for the section Women Who Made History. Thank you very much. And we are still here in A Sea of News... with Patita's humour and... much more news. Radio is a blind media... Until you watch with your ears... The Station Broadcast. Unique. Just like you. Hello. IX SEA OF NEWS - Were you busy? - No, not at all. I was just finishing some things for tomorrow’s programme. Well, actually I’d just got back from Pilates and was starting with some stuff… Is something wrong? No. Nothing’s wrong. Well… I don’t know if there’s any point in telling you this. I have some information that may be of use to you. Ah, OK. Some information… Something journalistic, you mean? Or what? It’s about Laura… Ah, OK. Some time ago, before she left, there were a number of situations that... may help us understand what happened. What happened with what? With her. So… Laura is in control of her faculties. She knows exactly what she's doing. It’s not like she went crazy. What? Nothing, nothing. Basically, Laura told me to meet her here once and she told me something very mysterious. Right here? Yes, here. In Kalos. You two came to Kalos a lot. Yes. Especially after that meeting. In that table. Laura used to sit next to the window. I used to sit facing her. Maybe I’m telling you something that you already know? No, no. Carry on, Chicho. She had found some hidden correspondence in some books, which she had been taking out of the municipal library. At the time, the two of us got obsessed with who the people who wrote the letters were... The letters were… Shall we say… …quite risqué. Quite risqué? Kind of erotic. Pornographic? Erotism. And there were two lovers who, for some reason, drifted apart. The thing is that Laura was really interested in the case. Carmen Zuna... The Kolontai books... She never told you anthing about this? And why are you telling me this? I think that some of what she’s going through might have something to do with this… What is she going through? This. What is this, Chicho? She disappeared, Juli. Well, I don’t know. She left. The thing with the letters and the books… Why are you talking so quietly? Because it’s a secret that evidently only the two of us uncovered. I think there’s a clue there, of course. I didn’t tell anyone… You met Rafael. How do you know? Have you got your car back yet? How do you know all this? I know Laura stole your car. Well, she didn’t actually steal it… I had to go and get it back with this guy. With this Rafael. - Do you know him? - Yes. He called me so many times that I blocked him in the end. I don’t trust him. He’s a typical Buenos Aires idiot. He’s a good guy. Yes, I’m sure he must be a good guy. I guess Laura doesn’t hang out with bad guys... I don’t know. I had like a revelation, an intuition. I think that what I'm telling you is going to help us find her. I know a lot about this. I know which places to go to look for her. I know how to speak to the people who must be around her right now. I know the world she went after. Believe me: there’s something in this letter business that I’m positive that… And what makes you think she wants to be found? Because maybe she doesn’t want to be found. I don’t know… I'm worried about her. I want to find her. I care about her. Chicho, do you have some time? I want you to see something with me. - Right now? - Right now. Sure. Can you... Can you hear me? No, the other ones. The retro ones, behind you. Can you hear me now? OK... Hello, Hello… Hel… Hello... OK. Let's go… Good afternoon. This is the section “Women who made history.” Today I’m going to talk about Alexandra Kollontai. Alexandra Kollontai was born in St Petersburg, Russia, in 1870. She was a Russian politician, Marxist, communist and revolutionary. She was the first woman to lead a ministry in a national government… No, wait… I'll start again. I chose this person, a woman, Russian, Marxist, feminist… Too many adjectives... No, wait. Rodro, I'll go again. Take three. Alexandra Kollontai wrote her life story... without knowing that some time later she would rewrite it. In her book “Autobiography of a woman…” No, no. That’s wrong… OK, I can’t get this. I can’t do it… Hang on… Oh, I need a wee. Juli, what is this? OK, I can’t figure this out. I can’t do it. Juli, listen… I’m going to record this for you, and leave it for you here, at the radio. Just for you. OK? This is a secret, Juli. When you listen to this, please, don’t share it with anyone. I’m leaving and I need someone to know. I don’t want to be the only one who knows. But I don’t want you to tell anyone either. I’ll be in touch. But I’m going to be OK. Especially that: I know I’m going to be great. Don’t look for me, unless something really strange happens. When you hear this and everyone’s looking for me... and wondering where I am... I’m going to be OK. I’m going to be doing what I want to do. Or what no one even thinks I could be doing... I don’t know if that’s clear… You’ll be wondering why I’m recording you this... I don’t know. Let me see… I’ll start with... I’ll start with the alligator. No, hang on. It’s like this… As soon as I arrived in Trenque... in those first days, when I was still getting acclimatized... something strange happened. Something that I forgot about later. - This is about the letters. - I think it was the day I arrived. Yes. Of course, that day. That day, I arrived and, dressed as I was, I had to go to work. Hello. - Laura? - Laura, yes. How are you? Do you have the adress? I have no idea. - Yes, to Baigorria's. - Thanks. The municipality arranged for a taxi direct from the bus station to a farm near Fortín. - Hello. - Hi. Are you doing a land survey of the area? Yes. Of flowers… Yes... We have a permit. I can show you if you want. No... No, that's not necessary. Just a quick question. Yes, go ahead. Have you found any of these round here? No… Not these ones... I found the ones with the long stem, which are similar. There are plenty of those here. I’ve only just started, though… Don’t worry. I needed these. Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. I don’t know how she got here. The gauchos didn’t even notice her. It was the closest thing to an apparition I’ve ever seen. Later I thought: I must have seen a ghost... one of those dead women who wander the fields. It was the closest thing to an apparition I’ve ever seen. Later I thought: I must have seen a ghost... - Carmen Zuna. - No. one of those dead women who wander the fields. A spectre. You know how I believe in those things… Then time passed, I forgot about the apparition, or her... I carried on as usual. The survey, the municipality, Normita... Rafa... The house in Buenos Aires... And I never saw that woman again. OK, hang on. Hey, I'm downing your whiskey... There's not much left, anyways. I'll buy you another. And just in that time... the thing with the letters and the books happened. I think I told you… Or did I not? Anyway, I came across this hidden correspondence in books that I took out of the library. Correspondence between two lovers… An Italian man and a woman from round here, from Trenque. - That's Carmen Zuna. - A very mysterious... love story. A teacher and her lover. All very pornographic. Well, I don’t know about pornographic, but very sexual letters. The truth is I got a bit obsessed. Well, “we” got obsessed. Me and Ezequiel. Chicho. We did some spying. We spent days with that. It was fun. I can’t remember if I told you… And I fell in love a bit… So… So… Yellow flowers. Remember that. One day I came across those flowers, the ones this woman had asked me for. - Did you find something? - No, it's nothing. Let's keep going. I wasn’t sure that they were exactly the same. And I didn’t know where I could find this woman to take them to her. I wasn’t even sure that this woman existed... So I left them and didn’t do anything. I carried on with my things. But anyway, remember that, because it’s important: yellow flowers. Remember that. That day… the day of the kiss. I don’t know if I told you about the kiss. It doesn’t matter, though. That day, we left Kalos and Ezequiel drove me to the hotel. See you tomorrow. Laura? - Hi. - How are you? Fine. Did you find the flowers I asked you for? Yes, I found them... - ... but I couldn’t find you. - But you couldn’t find me. Right. I think I know where they are. I can go tomorrow if you like. Where do you want them? Leave them here. Here? Yes, here. Aren’t you staying at El Faro? Yes. Being them here. Romina and I will come for them. Romina… Who’s Romina? Romina. See you tomorrow. “Leave them here at El Faro”. How did she know my name? How did she know I was staying at El Faro? Who was that woman? What was all this business with the yellow flowers? ESPERANZA RESIGNS THE LAKE CASE It was her. Yes. The mysterious woman, the spectre. It was her. It was Elisa Esperanza. And she had returned to the town... to take care of something that was worrying everyone. Some thing that I hadn’t paid so much attention to. Something that had happened three days earlier in the lake in the park. Something that you yourself reported to the whole town. X THE LAKE CASE Good morning everyone. We are starting the day with some news that is calling all our attention. It has to do with the apparition, in the early hours of this morning, in our town… where one of the rangers immediately reported what happened in the early hours. Until now, we cannot have much detail... but some authorities say it may be Marquitos. The orphan kid... who had appeared before at Laguna Gomez in Junín and who, after 10 days in observation... had managed to escape. In any case... it cannot be confirmed. Up until now, it cannot be confirmed whether it is a case of a child in a state of malnutrition or any other vulnerable condition. The organism... appeared unexpectedly, and it seemed to have been in the water for more than 24 hours. The phenomenon is causing more concern than usual among doctors and scientists, since they cannot understand how this being is still alive despite having spent so many days in such a precarious survival state... He is now in observation at Trenque Lauquen’s city hospital and priority is given to his health as much as to the authorities’ effort to find his origin. Dr. Elisa Esperanza, a local renowned MD... You read the news and at that time you talked about Elisa Esperanza. But for me it was just one of thousands of names involved in the case. At the time I was reading these erotic letters I’d found, from Carmen Zuna… I don't know. I didn’t pay much attention… I mean, when you reported it, I still didn’t know that was her. That she was the flower woman. The apparition. It's a very significant case, to which our community is probaly going to be paying close attention to. Yes, plus there are serious doubts... regarding, not just his sexuality but also the possibility of it being… human… - ... or something else. - I don’t get it. If not human, what would it be? I don’t know. Some kind of animal… Some kind of animal... Yes, those... savage kids… - ... raised by monkeys. - Monkeys in the Province of Buenos Aires… There are monkeys in the Province of Buenos Aires. Yes, so they say. So they say… - Rumors… - Rumors. Since we don’t deal in rumours... given that radio and journalism is what we do… we are going to leave this matter for later. We'd like to ask our listeners... What do you think about this matter? Given that it's calling up our community's attention deeply. At least I didn’t think I was crazy anymore or that I was imagining things. The woman existed. And had a name. And a very important mission: to take the lake case and work out what to do with that discovery. MYSTERIOUS APPARITION IN THE LAKE We’re here with Eugenio Pastor, manager of parks and green spaces in Trenque Lauquen, where the incident occurred. He’s going to tell us how this discovery came about. I was raking in one of the other parks... when I received an alert from an angler who’s a regular here, fishes early in the morning... who said he’d seen something strange. So then I started the Class C operation, which is when there’s a certain gravity to the matter. So we coordinate with the police, ambulance and other services… The town’s mayor, Francisco Pérez Fox... is still discussing with the provincial government and the national government what to do about the case... given that the nature of the being found yesterday in the central lake in the town has not yet been established. Meanwhile, Dr. Eliza Esperanza has taken responsibility for the chaos… Sorry, the case… and has caused more controversy. She had this to say this morning outside Trenque Lauquen hospital: The politicians can do politics. It’s us scientists who should be dealing with this kind of thing. And if they don’t like it, they can deal with the consequences themselves… or go to university and study. It's still free. The words there of Elisa Esperanza... who as usual uses a not very friendly style... quite hard on the press and with the people. Broadcasting straight from the central park in Trenque Lauquen... just a few feet away from where a creature was found two days ago that we still know little about. The authorities are continuing to debate how and where to study it as they still haven’t defined the nature of the being… We’re here with Alda Bossi... chief of staff of Trenque Lauquen mayor, Francisco Pérez Fox... after an unfortunate episode at Trenque Lauquen hospital... where according to witnesses... NURSE ASSAULTED AT LOCAL HOSPITAL the little boy lashed out at one of the nurses who was transferring him… Mayor Pérez Fox himself visted the nurse this afternoon in the hospital... - Ecxcuse me... - Yes, tell me. Was there any violence involved? Apparently, it hit him against a stretcher that was in the room, but we were unable to confirm whether the nurse slipped first, or how it was that it ended up there… Sunday afternoon. We’re outside Trenque Lauquen Town Hall. We’re here with the council’s press secretary. Thank you for meeting with us today. Are you aware of the commotion in the town? The storm, if you will... throughout the community as a result of this. We’re all concerned. We are citizens, like all the inhabitants of this town. We’re also concerned, but we want to send out a message of caution to the people. We’re not alarmed. Words from Press secretary Alberto Speczialle there… LU11 presents Juliana in... THE "LITTLE BOY" WAS AN ALLIGATOR ALL ALONG ... "A Sea of Words". The magazine that’s there for you each morning. We’ve finally had some news. It seems that the creature, according to Pérez Fox... - ... is a little animal. - One of God’s little animals! ESPERANZA RESINGS THE LAKE CASE It seems that the matter... which has caused great confusion throughout the community of Trenque Lauquen... was discussed this morning with Dr. Elisa Esperanza who resigned from the case... and stated that she would not be continuing with it... given that it is an… animal... and that her area of expertise is in human brains, not animal brains. Let's hear Dr. Elisa Esperanza, please. Samples were taken and the forensic team’s suspicions that it was some kind of animal were confirmed. The genetic samples seemed to be from a kind of alligator. We had a meeting with Pérez Fox and... I obviously resigned from the case, since it’s an animal and my specialization is human brains... not animals’. So the council’s team of biologists are analysing where the alligator came from, it appears to be from the north or something. An alligator... An alligator! Blimey! Mind you, it seems it’s a big-handed alligator. Sounds like it grabs you in the night and… Later, gator! Watch out! Let's go to a commercial break. Rodro... Oh, it was a big drama… The creature, the little boy, Marquitos, the monkey... was an alligator. Elisa Esperanza resigned. Case closed. Never heard another word. But what about the flowers? What was I suppoused to do with these flowers? Why had she asked me for these flowers? Why had she come to me? I thought: I have to find her. I wanted to make up a radio section so that I could approach her. I suggested it to you on the radio. But you said she was a liar, an accomplice of Pérez Fox’s... Crazy, round the bend, out of her mind, resentful. Whereas for me, she was a very mysterious woman... and beautiful... who I owed some flowers to. Yellow flowers. Crazy, round the bend, out of her mind, resentful. Whereas for me, she was a very mysterious woman... and beautiful... who I owed some flowers to. - Sorry, I don't understand a thing. - Let's continue... XI ELISA ESPERANZA "Arrowleaf sida..." - That’s gone in. Photo? - Got it. GPS capture? Here. Yes. Here. - Sage. - I need the common name. No, but it’s sage. That’s why I didn’t put anything. It’s the same. I won’t put anything, then. The thing is, if I leave the box empty, the system crashes. Put an X. Let’s see. Great. There we go. Oxalis, common name: wood sorrel. There’s a photo and capture. - Oxalia… - Oxalidaceae. OK, great, we’re done. Thank you. OK, if I can just get a signature, please. Right here, please. There we go. You’ll be reachable all the same? We’ll be able to contact you? She’s going to Buenos Aires, Grace. They have telephones there… OK, when are you going? No, I’m staying for now. But your contract runs out on the 30th. Yes, yes, I know. I’d have a word with Normita, eh… - Does Normita know? - Yes. I have to terminate your contract today. Yes, that’s fine. But haven’t you got a ticket to Buenos Aires for the 1st? Yes, but I’m not going to use it. Oh, that’s a shame, it’ll be lost. Bye, Liz! - OK... - You are leaving. Yes, already. Alright. Come visit us again. Yes. Thank you... - I won't be far. - OK. We'll be expecting you. By then I’d finished my work for the Council, so I left the hotel. Laura? - Hi! - Norma. Normita's mother. - Thank you. - I was just setting up your room... I didn't know why, but I decided not to go back to Buenos Aires right away. I didn't understand why. All the same, I felt that leaving would mean the end of my story with Elisa Esperanza. - I still don't understand what it is. - It's an animal... She wasn’t going to have a way of finding me. Days passed, and I couldn’t get it out of my head. I walked all over the town, and now I understand understand that I was walking to see if I’d find her. I trusted in that local saying... that two hours is enough to walk the town and bump into at least half of its inhabitants. One day I finally saw her. She was getting into a red pickup and doing various journeys. I followed her. The red pickup made things easier. But most of all, there was something that helped me realize that she was there. A song. She always went round the town listening to the same song. An 80s song. - Hello. - Hi, I'll be right with you. I followed her to a garden centre. She was buying flowers. For some reason I didn’t speak to her. Nor did she to me. She acted like she couldn’t see me. Or she didn’t see me. I was never entirely sure. I got used to following her through the music. Like she was the pied piper of Hamelin. I finally came to the house where she lived. She lived with another woman. At some stage, something happened. I don’t remember if it was the alarm first or whether they noticed something was up and then the alarm went off. Listen carefully to what I’m going to tell you, Juli because it’s really weird. Imagine... The two women were completely relaxed, almost partying. Suddenly, an alarm goes off and they go crazy, maximum alert. Suddenly Elisa Esperanza starts to do something that I can’t see or understand. At first I thought she had a syringe. Then she left. Then I see that, what’s worrying them, the thing that set off the alarm, is on the first floor of the house. Elisa Esperanza reappeared shortly after. Everything sorted, it seemed. Then there was a moment of calm. But then I started to hear something. A strange sound, like a recorder. But it clearly wasn’t a recorder. If there was one thing I was sure of, it was that that sound was coming from someone. Someone who was alive. A moan, a cry. That’s it, like a child or a puppy crying. And this is where the real story begins, Juli. It’s not the letters, not the books. It’s not Ezequiel. Not Rafael. It’s the "little boy." The alligator. The alligator exists, Juli. The alligator or whatever you want to call it, from the lake, exists. That’s the first thing I have to say. The alligator. The alligator exists, Juli. The alligator or whatever you want to call it, from the lake, exists. That’s the first thing I have to say. The next day, I got the flowers, I got my nerve up and I knocked on their door. - Would you like some ice? - Yes. Is he here? Who told you that? I don’t know… He’s here, yes. Can I see him? No. No... All right. Hear him? Hear him breathing. It sounds like little bubbles. I don't hear a thing. You have to wait for it. Wait for it. Nothing. I’m preparing that bedroom. The idea is that he lives here? As long as possible… Hello. Romina’s here, you’ll have to leave. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Come. Pour yourself something, if you want. Come. Sit. They're here again. Let’s see if I can catch it. There are two of them. I told you we have to leave poison all over the place. But you don't want the poison. And you? Do you want a sandwitch? Have a sandwitch! Rude one over here, didn't offer you anything. Go ahead, eat. Don't worry about it. She even makes me look like the mean one. You look at us and think "she's the mean one." She’s the mean one. With those angel eyes... Isn't she? I can’t kill a mosquito. She’s the one the whole town hates. I am good, I am easy-going. I am an easy-going gal. Don’t you see me easy-going? I see myself as easy.going. How can you not see me easy-going if you drank all of my whisky? Eat. - No, thanks. - Eat! You were hungry… You were hungry, huh? What are you laughing at, fatty? Come here. It's a bit late, isn't it? Yes, sorry. I'm going. Come visit us whenever you like. Just let us know. OK... Elisa… Can I ask you something? Sure. What is it? What do you mean? Yes. What is it? Is it an animal? A boy? A plant? It's a being that can breath under water... And it's a mutant. Someone that everyday becomes something different. Like a chameleon. No... And these days I think it's a female. That's it. Should I walk you to the gate? Or can you do it by yourself? No, no. I can do it. After that night... I spent a few days wandering around the town. No direction… I was like on holiday. Finally, one day Elisa called me to ask for help. And I stayed there. I stayed several days. - Laura, can you help me out over here? - Yes. We started doing things in the house. Maintenance work. With the allotment, things like that… Thyme, oregano. Sage, rosemary. Chamomile works too, if you find any. - Coriander? - No, not coriander. During the day we gathered things. Go the shed, look for... I couldn’t understand whether we were cleaning the park or whether something more was happening. - Select everything that is similar... - Ah, you’re doing that. ... and make sure that they haven’t got damp and they’re not chipped. And rods. Rods. Poles from the fallen fences. - There’s some over there… - No, no. Those over there. All the poles and fallen fences, grab them. - And acorns. - Acorns. From the oaks. All you can find. - The holm oak over there too, right? - No. No, they’re no good. Not the holm oak. Eucalyptus berries. - Berries are the little fruits, no? - Yes. Gather as many as you can. Leaves. Dry leaves. Make sure they’re dry. That’s important. If they’re not dry, leave them in the sun to dry… - The agropol? - No, not that. OK, I found some stuff. I didn’t know if this size was any good... This is very good. Very good. Look! - That's good, isn't it? - Yes. We didn’t talk about the “little boy.” It was always there. They dodged the subject and gradually I learned that it was something that I couldn’t talk to them about. In any case, I had to wait. And I knew that sooner or later they were going to let me see it. Or they were going to tell me… The truth. - Oh, how nice. - Yes. Look. It's huge. One afternoon, walking in the country... I found a very small field of the yellow flowers. It was covered and locked with a metal sheet and a padlock. I decided not to ask. The upstairs floor continued to be a mystery. Since that night, with the whisky... we never mentioned it again. I continued to respect the silence. But I found it very hard to understand what was happening. Those days, when I stayed the night... they didn’t even seem to pay attention to it. Some night I heard them. I heard them working. Strange noises, arguments. The next day, they were sleeping like animals. I sometimes fantasized about going up, opening the door and seeing it. But I quickly understood that that wasn’t the arrangement. I had to wait. Meanwhile, everything was love between the three of us. I loved them more each day. I felt that I wanted to be with them. I wanted to be them. I was them. - How's my fatty doing? - Hungry, as usual. Hey! Come here! I lost the fear of getting lost, of dying, of taking a risk... of becoming an animal, an extra-terrestrial or the mad woman in the village. I felt that everything they did was going to be OK. And I wanted to be there. One night we drank something. A very bitter brew that Elisa prepared. She told us it was going to do us good, to relax us and blow away our fears. I don’t remember exactly, but... I remember that that night she spoke to me. She finally spoke to me. Romina’s going to be late back today. She's staying in town, right? No… You know something? The flowers you bought that day... The flowers, yes. The ones I asked you for. - Yes, the flowers. - Yellow flowers. Yellow flowers. Short stem. They’re the ones eaten by… Eaten by...? Eaten. Right. The ones it eats... We used your samples for The Plantation, you know? I never told you. That’s good. I was saying to Romina yesterday that... when we finish working on the room, maybe you could see it. You know how we’ve been working at night? Yes, I hear you. It’s not that I want to hear you. But I can hear you. So anyway... Maybe when we finish everything… You can see it. We’ll have to see if it wants to... Right. If it wants to. That day you came to see me in the country… Yes. That land near Fortín… Right, it was near Fortín. You were already looking for those flowers. - Yes. - Yellow flowers, short stem. Yes. Can I ask you why? What do you mean, why? Why were you looking for them when the little boy…? Oh, please, don’t be ridiculous. Don’t call it “the little boy”... OK. Why were you looking for them if nothing had appeared in the lake yet? Did you already know that there was something in the lake? - I mean… - I understand perfectly what you mean. Do you mind if we have a moment of silence? No. I think I'm going to drink some more. - Do you want more too? - No, I think I’m fine. Thanks. Until that night, the night of the brew, Elisa hadn’t spoken to me about the flowers. Or the little boy, or the room, or anything. Something happened. They asked me to leave the house... Said they wanted to be alone, that they had to do some things “behind closed doors.” I didn’t understand if I had done something wrong or what… I don’t know. I didn’t understand. I went back to my house. Well, Telma’s house. I had a strange night. That insomnia that sometimes takes a hold of me. Morning came. At some stage I managed to drop off, but I was woken by the phone. Hello? Hello? Hello? Are you alone? I’m Elisa. Are you alone? I don't know... We need to talk to you. Are you alone? Can you talk? I don't know. I don't know if I'm alone. I’m alone in the room, that I know. OK. Do me a favour. Go where you are sure you are alone and I'll call you back. Hello? Hear me out. Does anyone know you were here? - No. - Good, good. You did good. Listen, I need you to get a car. A car? What do you mean a car? Speak more quietly. A car. A regular one. Can you? A regular car… I don’t know, I should check, I think I can. Can you or not? Yes, OK. I can. Good. Get it now. - Now? - Yes, now. Get it and go to my house. - Your house? - Yes, to my house. Go in through the back. OK… Fine, but what happened? I'll tell you later. Do as I say and wait for my call. And don’t wear colors that are too bright, OK? Hey! What a surprise. - I thought you had left. - No, I didn’t leave. Did you come to visit me? I came to ask you for a favour. Can I borrow your car? - The car? - Yes. - Do you need a lift somewhere? - No, there’s no need. - Did something happen? - No, no. - Something happened. - I’ll tell you later, can I? Yes, of course. Can I borrow it? Okay, fine. - But I’ll need it at 6. - Yes, by 6 it’ll be here. Sharp, is it possible? Because I have to take the kids. - The key is inside, wait here? - Of course. Thanks, Eze. - Do you have a licence? - Yes, yes. Be careful with the break, it’a bit wobbly, OK? Elisa asked me to get a car. She didn’t explain much. "Get a car", she said. I asked Chicho for his car and did as they told me. I went to the house. “We need food”, Elisa said. "Someone suspected something and reported us. We had to leave the house. We need you to help us, we’re desperate. Go in the back door of the place and then go through a window. Go to the room upstairs, the room that’s being built, and take the in vitro. If you find food, take that. Take everything you find. We’re going round the fields, to see if we find more. We’ll meet up tomorrow morning, at 10. At the service station in Fortín Olavarría. We’ll leave from there, all together. And please, don’t wear bright colours. It doesn’t like them." When I went into the room, I realized what we’d been working for all that time. I'm not sure what happened then. But when I woke up it was the next day already. I mean, today. I don’t understand what I did with those flowers. The last thing I remember is to have smelled them... But maybe I ate them, I don't know. The thing is, I slept and rested. Like an animal. OK. It’s raining now. I’ll have to owe you a section. Sorry, Juli. I don’t think you’ll hear from me for a long time. Don’t look for me. I’m leaving. - What I have to do now... - Who are you leaving with? - Rodro! - What are you doing here so early, Laura? Have you put together a show for singles? No wonder the automatic cut off! Nina, a friend. Laura. - Hello. Yes, I know her. - Hi, how are you? Curcio called me, said the broadcast had cut off. - Did you touch anything? - No, I swear. I came to record my bit for Juli, because I won’t be able to come in tomorrow. I was recording it with desk 2, I didn’t touch desk 1. - But you’re at desk 1. - What? You’re going out live… Nah. Kidding. I don’t know what happened to the automatic. Damn thing. Why don't you go get us some mate, Gringa? - I don't know where the yerba is ... - It's all in the kitchen. Pour it and bring it. Well... Do you want to carry on, Laurita? Yes? Or do you want me to stop it? Or edit it, or render it, I can do whatever you want. Yes, stop it. Stopping it, then. It's all in the kitchen. Pour it and bring it. Well... Do you want to carry on, Laurita? Yes? Or do you want me to stop it? Or edit it, or render it, I can do whatever you want. Yes, stop it. OK. That's it. I can't figure out when Laura recorded this for you. I don't understand why she records it. What are we supposed to do? There's nothing we have to do, Chicho. Nothing. Nothing at all. XII LAURA'S PART Good morning, everyone. We’re here in a new edition of “A Sea of News”. We're listening to Tracy Chapman. In the mean time, we can contemplate the stormy weather from the west of the Buenos Aires province. Many of you are probably still getting out of bed. How nice is the aroma of damp soild in the streets of Trenque Lauquen, no? Hello. Thanks. Hello? Why weren’t you answering? I thought I didn’t have to take the call... We thought something happened to you. We’ll stop here anyway. What? That we’ll stop here. We had to leave. We got thousand of flowers. You keep those, or get rid of them, or do as you please. You did good. We didn’t make it. But it wasn’t you, it was our fault. Don't worry. Do you have money to return? No, but don’t worry. - I can handle it… - Yes. You’ll be able to handle it. Thank you for everything. Kisses from both of us. FAREWELL, FAREWLL. I'M LEAVING, I'M LEAVING. - Do you need anything? - No, thanks. No, no. I don't want anything. Cheers! Excuse me, mate. When I hear the word "truco"... - "Truco"! - Let's see. I shuffle... You won't discover a thing! You, take a close look. There. A 2. It's a 7! And then... The card disappears! Another one, bravo! This is strong.
