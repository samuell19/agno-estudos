The words were so kind and sensitive, not exactly what you'd expect from a man who'd spent 20 years locked up for murder. Over the last 10 years, David's become like the older brother I never had, and I've become part of a team of people fighting for his freedom. I think you've done more for me than I have done for you, to tell you the truth. I was a -- pretty much a kid when I came to this place. I hadn't been anywhere, really, you know? Sometimes, you can't really quantify it into words. You know what I mean? How much it meant just seeing life outside of this place. You know, this is a dark place.

You know, he came from a big Southern family, and I came from, you know -- I was an only child, but I think the similarities are that we were both good kids at heart who got in trouble because we were trying to fit in. I'm gonna make a very simple dish today. [Ray's mother laughs] As a kid, my parents and I were really close. It was always just us three. ♪♪ I come from a very mixed neighborhood in Toronto. ♪♪ It wasn't a bad place, but the people that had adopted a criminal lifestyle, they were feared and respected, and I wanted that same respect. So I tried to act like them. We were concerned about the friends that you had. You know, ultimately, all of those kids are good-hearted and -- but some of them were in trouble themselves. Some of them carried guns. In my neighborhood, when you tried to act tough, you had to back it up, and I couldn't, so I got bullied, and that made me angry. You know, I was an asshole to my parents during that time. And my dad just wasn't gonna take my shit. And so we were always at each other's throats. You had a lot of anger, and sometimes people do things they don't understand the consequences of. There was this dude who I thought had stolen from me. You know, we got in a verbal confrontation. The verbal confrontation ended. Took a brick, and I just whipped it through his front window. And then I ran away, [Chuckles] which is probably the opposite of being tough 'cause the kids in my neighborhood would just knock that guy out. He called the police, and I got arrested. I think for my parents, that was the turning point. I reached the point where I felt I had completely lost control of, uh... you and your upbringing. Maybe I felt, too, that I didn't know you anymore, not the way I thought I knew you. Uh, and I thought, "I have this friend who's in a prison." I felt that he could give my son the straight goods, whereas whatever I'm saying to him might be just so much B.S. You know, he'll say, "Bah, forget about it, Dad." You know, "You don't know what you're talking about." But he can't say that to a man who's in prison. So I wrote to David and I said, "Would you be willing to correspond with my son?

When you said, "The privilege of writing his son," that was the first thing in that letter that sort of like, put my guard down and let me listen to you... Right. ...without the guard.

You know, it was rough, man. I mean, I've seen some horrible things. Seen people get shot. You know, I've seen people get stabbed. I started hanging out with rather rough individuals, so if you didn't be tough at that time, then you will become somewhat of prey. People will be picking on you.

I was more of a cereal guy than anything. On that particular Sunday, we decided that we were gonna go to the park at Junior High School 296.

I said, "Okay, but I didn't do anything wrong." [Handcuffs click, car door closes] We were driving down, and one detective said to me, "If you fucking keep leaning on me, I'm gonna slap the shit out of you." At that time, I didn't know exactly what was going on, but I knew there was a problem. ♪♪ So when I got down to the 83rd precinct, they took me upstairs to a very small room with no windows, and I sat there for what seemed like forever, really. Joseph Butta was a police officer. He was saying that they had found a body in a park -- in Aberdeen Park in Brooklyn. Someone was killed. And I said, "I don't know what -- what you're talking about." Detective Butta -- I'd say that he was a very, very intimidating guy. He was a 18-year veteran, and he had a lot of experience. I was very scared. He asked me did I know Willie Stuckey? I said he was a friend of mine. Police officer Butta said to me that Willie said I shot Nathan Blenner. ♪♪ He brought Willie Stuckey to the door. They said to Willie Stuckey, "Is that him?" And Willie nodded his head yes. I couldn't believe it. Why -- Why the fuck would he -- Why would he say that? Why would he say that I killed somebody when he know that neither he or I was there. ♪♪ Butta said, "Look, if you tell me what happened, I will let you go home." And I said, "Officer, I don't know what you're talking about because I've never driven a car my life, ever. I've never been to that particular neighborhood. I didn't know anything about Nathan Blenner." And it was at that moment when I said that I didn't know who he was talking about that he slapped me in my face. He picked up a chair, and he was threatening to hit me with the chair. I knew right then that I had to say something, and I had to tell this officer what he wanted to know. And then I said yes, literally repeating what he had previously said to me. At that time, I was willing to do and say anything they wanted. Willie was pointing the finger at me. You know, if he's saying I did it, well, I'm gonna say he did it. I'm gonna say he shot the person, Detective Butta started feeding me details. He would say, for example, "You saw this guy sitting in his car, right?" And so when he said, "Right," what I did was I just said, "Yes, we did," you know? And then he would actually ask me another question, and then it would just go on and on and on and on again. ♪♪ Butta said, "Look, we got a videotape set up, and you're gonna go in there and you're gonna repeat exactly what you repeated to me." That was it. ♪♪ -Butta: Sir, what is your name? -David McCallum. Appearing on videotape was absolutely and unequivocally the worst mistake of my life. I don't think anything can -- can actually compare to that. Anything. I felt like it was important for me to try to make my confession more believable to the officers there. So what I did was I put details in the confession When someone looks at the confession, they will see that information that was supplied by Willie Stuckey and the confession that I made, they were totally inconsistent with one another. [Telephone rings] Ernestine: 1:00, the phone rang. I answered the phone. And they said, "Do you have a son by the name of David McCallum?" And I said, "Yes. Where is he?" They said, "We have him at the precinct." So I said, "Well, he's only 16." I say, "He need one of his parents there." He said, "If you come, you can't see him." [Siren wailing] ♪♪ ♪♪ Ray: "Hey, David. Thanks for sharing your story with me. It was eye-opening, to say the least. Hearing about where you're from and what happened to you has definitely made me rethink my own actions and decisions. I have a lot to be thankful for." ♪♪ I bring to you the message that I heard in prison. I am a survivor. A survivor of the American so-called criminal justice system. And the same way... Ken was a teacher, and his class wrote me letters, uh, asking me to appear, uh, at their school to speak with them. And I did. Ray: It was my dad's way to meet one of his idols, Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, the legendary boxer who was incarcerated for 19 years for a crime he didn't commit. And as I began to know Ken Klonsky a little more, we decided to do an article for "The Sun" magazine. Ken: A lot of people saw that, including David McCallum. David read the interview, and he contacted me. So the world, sometimes you choose, and sometimes it chooses you, and I just decided I wasn't gonna turn away from this person. Ray: David asked my dad to go over his trial transcripts because he wanted to send them to Rubin. So even though he's not a lawyer, my dad just started going through them himself. Ken: The first time through, it was fairly clear to me that he was guilty. But then I decided, "I'm gonna take a second look at this." And the second time through, the whole case came apart. Ray: So my dad retired from teaching and managed to get Rubin Carter onboard to help with the case. Rubin's star power helped attract Oscar Michelen... a lawyer who had successfully fought some other wrongful-conviction cases in New York. My opinion of David is that he's got a tremendous heart, tremendous courage, and there's no hatred. There's no seeking of vengeance. And to stay positive, I don't know how he does it, frankly. My dad provided the emotional support for David. He talked to him on the phone every week, kept his head in the right place. Rubin was our face, the spokesperson, and Oscar was our lawyer. With everything happening, I looked at the court documents one day and couldn't believe they could convict somebody with so little evidence. I became convinced of David's innocence and really wanted to get involved. As the team began to reinvestigate the case, the first step was to look back into what actually happened to Nathan Blenner. I think, for me, it's easy to forget that there's another victim in this case other than David. The crime itself is really shocking. So, we're here now at the scene of the crime. That's where Nathan's car was parked. He was getting ready to go, get it started, when a couple of boys who were playing in the street saw two young male blacks come down this street. One of them took out a gun. This is their testimony. They then heard one of the abductors tell Nathan, "Get the 'F' in the car." They pushed him in the car, and they drove off. [Engine revving, tires squealing] ♪♪ Ray: The day after Nathan Blenner was kidnapped from the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens, his body was found in Aberdeen Park in Brooklyn. ♪♪ His car had been burned and left in an empty lot. One week later, David McCallum and Willie Stuckey were arrested and charged with the murder. [Siren wails] ♪♪ New York City in the mid 1980s, crime was at an all-time high because of gangs, gun violence, and crack. There were multiple murders every day. The police, that time, had their hands full. Courts were fed up. People had had it. Jurors had had it. "We want our city back." And all those pressures were coming to bear into that courtroom when David and Willie were ushered into it for their trial. It wasn't just about their case. It was about all of the crime that was going on in the city at that time. ♪♪ [Indistinct chatter, gavel bangs] When this case was tried, this was before the days of DNA evidence, and that's very important because one of the things that DNA evidence has established is that people do falsely confess to crimes, particularly young teenagers. ♪♪ On top of that, this was one of the early days of videotaped confessions, so it was very unusual for a jury to be able to actually see the defendant allegedly confessing to the crime. Here, you have the guy right in front of you on film. You can see that there's no gun to his head. So in the end, nobody believed that those confessions were coerced. These two teenagers had no chance with professional interrogators. And that's the only so-called evidence that the state presented, was this false confession. Ray: To see if we could find anything that was missed at the trial, Rubin Carter sent the tapes to Steve Drizin, one of the world's leading experts on false confessions. If you simply look at the tapes, you get the impression that the person on the tape may, in fact, be guilty because the tapes don't tell the story. One signifier of a false confession is that the confession doesn't lead police to any additional evidence. There's nothing in that confession that the police officers didn't already know from some other source. Not a single fingerprint anywhere in the car that belongs to McCallum or Stuckey. I mean, these are teenage kids, and we know from scores of cases that juvenile suspects are more vulnerable than adults to the kinds of police techniques that we see over and over again. And you have both Stuckey and McCallum independently saying that they were struck by the lead detective, Detective Butta. What's his reason for being there? He's not conducting any questioning. He is there to intimidate David McCallum. But I would say that the most important factor to me in the confession is what we call a false fed fact. When police canvassed Nathan Blenner's neighborhood, they interviewed a woman who we'll call Chrissy. Chrissy could have been a key witness, but she was never brought into the trial. Around the time of Nathan Blenner's abduction, Chrissy was washing her car on the street when she was accosted by two black males. ♪♪ Oscar: One of them in braids. They come up to her and say, "Hey, you got a nice car." Neither McCallum or Stuckey wore braids. Now, that occurred within an hour before Nathan Blenner's abduction. Steve: Stuckey's confession has this account of meeting a woman or a girl on the street. Now, why is that important? Because her description of the offenders doesn't fit Stuckey and McCallum. ♪♪ Oscar: The jury had no idea that someone had given a description of two male blacks that did not match McCallum and Stuckey's description at around the time of the crime. I mean, it's ludicrous. Ray: David's court-appointed lawyer dropped the ball in pretty much every way possible. He never visited the crime scene. David says he was interviewed only once before his trial. And he failed to even bring Chrissy into the case. He was later disbarred. Ray: Tell me about your lawyer. I mean, well, for the camera, I'm gonna be very kind here. So I'm gonna say that he was... grossly incompetent, to say the least. What do you really think? He was a piece of shit. Oscar: There was reasonable doubt all over the place, so when you open up the file, you see the route for his exoneration right there. Ray: David's lawyer had this evidence and didn't use it, so it can't be used for an appeal now. That's just the way the law works. Had he had better representation at trial, he'd probably be walking the streets right now. Steve: The only evidence linking these guys to this crime is this confession, and little did he know that this five minutes of testimony was gonna cost him the rest of his life. It's really tragic. The verdict was guilty on all charges. Um, I was convicted for felony murder and for intention of murder and, uh, robbery and kidnapping. For me, it was almost like in slow motion because I was still waiting for a not-guilty verdict. I was really afraid to turn around to see the reaction of my mother, because I know she's gonna be hurt. I didn't cry at that time because I was too much in shock, but as soon as I went back to the bullpen, I started crying then because I, at that time, realized that I wasn't gonna be going home. ♪♪ You don't ever get used to it. But sometime it... it just takes everything away from me, and sometime I just try to block it out of my mind, but it still come back. [Indistinct chatter] [Door closes] David: "Hey, Ray, to tell you the truth, I do still think about that confession every day. It was the biggest mistake of my life, and it used to make me angry, but over the years, I've learned that if you spend time feeling sorry for yourself, you're missing out on the opportunity to move forward with your life. I hope you learn that, too." Ray: If he's not an angry prick after everything he's been through, you know, what right do I have to be? ♪♪ David used his story and his experience to show me that I'm free to shape my future and follow my dreams. And, you know, that's -- that's a pretty powerful thing for a young person to realize. ♪♪ Ken: David's given him a sense of the value of his own life, and it's not something that he should throw away lightly, and, uh, he's got opportunities that David never had. ♪♪ David: "What's up, Ray? I'm so glad to hear your business ideas are becoming a reality. That's amazing. Congratulations. I feel like I'm along for the ride with you. Ray: I had always wanted to own my own business, so some friends and I got together, and we opened up a restaurant for students in Montreal. David gave me the confidence to say, you know, "I can do whatever I put my mind to." I had always dreamed about making films and TV shows. He encouraged me. I got my grades up, and I actually got into film school. All these amazing things were happening. But the question was always on my mind -- "What can I do to help David?" How can I pay him back for everything he's been doing for me?" I told every single one of my friends about David It was my first-ever video class, and I met Marc -- you, and I was like, "I want to go down to New York and interview David's family." And you were like, "Yeah, cool. That'd be awesome." [Car horn honks] ♪♪ So Marc and I headed down to New York and met David's family. High-five? ♪♪ We met Oscar. Yeah, well, they almost saw me. We went to Toronto to see Rubin. How are you?I'm very good, young man. And everywhere we went, we would talk to people and tell them about David and tell them David's story. We weren't sure how this was actually gonna help, but we had to do something. So, uh, I'm going out to see David today. He just got transferred to a new prison. It's Otisville Correctional Facility. It's about an hour and 45 minutes from New York. He's been so kind of down lately, so I try to go see him a lot. Marc: What are you guys gonna talk about today? We'll probably talk about the case. We'll talk about parole, which is coming up. David's sentence is 25 to life, so after 25 years, he's eligible for parole. David's had three parole hearings so far, and he's been denied each time. David's fourth parole hearing is coming up, and we're hopeful that he's finally gonna be able to come home to his mother, sister, niece, and nephew, who continue to support him year after year. I really believe I have an opportunity based on the things that I've done in prison, you know? My accomplishments, and I've been -- I've managed to stay out of trouble, and I get along with people, so I think I've -- I think I'm a perfect candidate, objectively speaking. David tells me that you are quite the, um... the computer whiz, that you're gonna teach him how to use a computer when he gets out. Mia: Yep. What are you gonna show him? I'm gonna show him how do you turn it on and how does it work. [Chuckles] ♪♪ It's easy to forget how little David knows about the world that we live in. ♪♪ People spend 20 years in prison, and you come out of prison, you're -- bam -- right back here in society, and you know nothing about this society. Ray: David has never used the Internet. He's never used a cellphone. He's like, "I'm pretty bad at this Internet. There's Googles and Facebook." When I'm visiting with him, sometimes he'll ask me, like, how to flirt with girls or, like, dating and stuff like that. If he gets out on parole, then he gets out as a murderer, and, you know, good luck getting a job when every application you have to fill out says, "Have you been convicted of a crime?" Yes. "Which crime?" You know, murder. So, David's next parole hearing is coming up, but parole doesn't mean freedom. And that's what we're all really fighting for. It is very difficult to overturn a jury's verdict. I've had some of the best-known people in the whole world supporting me, and yet, even with all of that support, I just narrowly escaped through the eye of a needle. David: When I was 17 years old, I filed a number of appeals on my own. Some of the issues were ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and the fact that the confessions were false. A self-written appeal by a prison inmate without a high-school education, without the assistance of a lawyer had no chance in Hell. And so, after eight years, all my appeals were exhausted. The law is clear -- once an argument is raised and considered by an appellate court, that argument is gone for good for that defendant. The only way to secure David's freedom now is to find new evidence and make new arguments. Ray: As the team really started to dig into David's case and, you know, search for new evidence, Marc and I tagged along as often as we could. We even went out by ourselves to search for any information that could help. Did you know any of the kids that worked here? If I said some names, you wouldn't know anyone? No. None of them. ♪♪ Uh-huh. ♪♪ I don't know what I would have done had I found something, but I was just doing whatever I could do. We tried the victim's family. We tried the Stuckey family. We talked to people in the neighborhood who knew David back in the day. Well, for a fact, I know that as far as David knew anything, he had nothing to do with it. Ray: We even tried the two witnesses who saw Nathan get taken away. They were 11 years old at the time. You don't know where he lives? [Siren chirps] -Oscar: Think that's for us? -Ray: I think it is for us. Ray: "Hey, David. I'm out here doing everything I can for you. Nobody will talk to us, though, and it's really frustrating. What happened to Nathan was so awful that I understand now why no one wants to revisit the past." Every single part of this whole thing is infuriating. Butta's dead. His partner's dead. Marc: Willie's dead. Willie's dead. Uh, David's lawyer's dead. David's lawyer's dead. Everything just feels like a waste of time, but it's like, well, what else are you supposed to do? David: For me to walk out of here, it's gonna take someone coming forward to say that they actually committed this crime, or there's going to be strong evidence to suggest and prove that I'm innocent, along with Willie Stuckey. Short of that, um, you know, I-I don't think it's gonna happen. [Indistinct chatter] Say hi. Hello. David: My oldest sister, Ella -- she's probably the person I think about the most. My sister was born with cerebral palsy. That means she has a disability that doesn't allow her to do some of the things that I'm able to do. Ernestine: I didn't know she didn't have a bone in the back. I know when I set her up, she'd fall over, but when they X-rayed and everything, they said, "She doesn't have a spine in the back." They told us that she wouldn't live till she get 13. That bothered me for awhile. But after she passed 13, it didn't bother me anymore because I said, you know, "They don't know what they talking about." Ray: How -- How old is she now? She 52. My sister's my hero for the very reason that she's probably one of the strongest individuals I've ever met, that I've ever seen in my life. She just -- she didn't ask to be in her circumstance. God made it that way, and that's fine. But my sister is my sister, and... I mean, that's a tough one, man. [Telephone rings]Ken: David. Hello, David. David: Hello. How you doing? Oh, I'm just great. Uh, how about you today? Ken: He gets very down, and when you're talking to him, you feel it to such an extent that it's -- it's as if you're being drawn under water, Ray: Still a light at the end of the tunnel? There always is. There's always the next appeal. There's always the next parole hearing. There's always the next investigation. You never know what you're gonna find. We're trying to crack a 28-year-old case. It's a pretty monumental task, and we needed help. Ray: Has your work ever got in the way of any of your relationships? Absolutely. I would have to say my relationships have got in the way of my work. [Laughs] Whoo!

So [Laughs] it's like I'm in. Ray: When the police searched Nathan Blenner's burnt car, they found cigarette butts in the ashtray. These cigarette butts had never been tested for DNA because the technology didn't exist at the time. Rubin and Oscar successfully petitioned the Brooklyn D.A.'s office to test the cigarette butts. And lo and behold, the lab found a match. The DNA isn't David's. It's not Willie's. It's somebody totally new that we had never heard about before. This is it right here.

That is a fact that we have to deal with. The problem what we -- You were in that car smoking cigarettes. ♪♪ So, I must say, I don't know what to make of it. You know, it could be that he just doesn't remember. I think he's holding back. And I just said to Van, "It really doesn't matter if he's telling the truth or not." Ray: How do you figure? 'Cause what are we gonna do? Are we gonna Tase him? We're gonna waterboard him? What are we gonna do? When he comes to declare, he'll look you right in the face, and he says, "I have no idea." Ray: In retrospect, I guess I... I kind of feel stupid, but... You know, I don't know, I just -- I thought that, you know, he'd have nothing to lose. He was only 14. We don't think he killed him.

The letter was republished around the world. ♪♪ And we promised Rubin that we'd keep fighting until David's name is cleared. And if it means trying to find the killers 28 years later, then that's what we're gonna do. Trying to find the real killers brings us back to Chrissy, because she saw two guys that day who didn't match David and Willie's description because one of them had braids. So could these be the same two guys that kidnapped Nathan Blenner? You know, sometimes you got to go over the paperwork over and over again. Try to be objective. Don't be judgmental. ♪♪ Oscar: Four days after Nathan Blenner's kidnapping, Chrissy reported that her car had been stolen. Chrissy and Nathan Blenner had the exact same car. Ray: When you look closely at the investigation reports, you see that Detective Butta actually did question two guys who matched Chrissy's description before he even knew about David and Willie. They were carjackers and had been arrested in Nathan Blenner's neighborhood. What's more reasonable -- that professional car thieves accosted Nathan Blenner and pulled this off, or two 16-year-old kids without a motive and no gain pulled this off? Ray: The first suspect, and we're gonna call this guy Jake, he gave Detective Butta a ton of information. Not only did he have a history of violent crimes, he had a direct connection to Nathan Blenner's car. When police were searching the burnt Buick Regal, they found the kerosene can that was used to torch it. Butta's partner recognized from the price tag that the kerosene can came from a local hardware store in Bushwick known as Pop's. The suspect ends up working at this Pop's hardware store where the kerosene can came from, and that remarkable coincidence, frankly, that incredible accomplishment of good police work goes un-followed-up. No one does anything with that. ♪♪ Ray: Butta's report gives us almost no information on the second guy, the guy with braids, who we're gonna call Murray. He's currently on probation, and Van found his sister's address. That's where he's supposed to be staying. He's visited with her a number of times. She's really nice and keeps trying to connect us with her brother, but he's clearly dodging. Woman: Hello?Yes, good afternoon. This is, uh, private investigator Van Padgett. Oh, hi, Van. How are you? How are you? How's everything? I'm okay. Hanging in there.[ Laughs ] I'm still trying to get in contact with your brother. Okay.Have you heard anything? Yes, he was here yesterday.

All right. Ray: Good luck. Hey, hey. We don't believe in luck. Luck is for nonbelievers. [Grunts] [Car door closes] [Dishes clattering in distance] [Elevator whirs] How you doing? Hi. Okay. My pleasure, my pleasure. Ray: We had missed him again, but this time, his sister revealed new information not contained in any police report. Even before her brother was arrested in Queens, he had already been questioned for Nathan Blenner's murder. Police had raided their house and taken him to the station. The police immediately started looking at him. How many cops was there? Really? They told him he was about -- Do you recall how long after they discovered the body in the park that the police came to your house? Was he known in the neighborhood to these detectives? Did she say anything that would lead you to believe that he actually did it? What she's saying is that they came immediately after they discovered the body. Like, two to three days afterwards. But he wasn't giving it up. He wasn't like David and them. You know, he wasn't this kid that you can just like, "I'm gonna beat it out of you." "Okay, keep beating. I'm not -- I don't know what you're talking about." Yeah. Ray: Murray just keeps dodging us, but there's one place that you can't hide. Van saw that Murray had been arrested, and he and Oscar jumped on the opportunity to pay him a visit. He confirmed everything his sister told us and more. Oscar: He told us he was questioned about this case no less than four times. So, did you get a signed affidavit? I'm looking at it right now.Yes! So, he signed an affidavit, which is like a sworn statement. It doesn't prove that David didn't do it. I had this foolish idea that he was just going to admit to everything, and that didn't happen. So it's not a home run. Ultimately, we still need to figure out why David and Willie were arrested in the first place. ♪♪ At one point, you could see Butta was building a case. And I think, somewhere along the line, something happened where he decided he's gonna createa case. Ray: So, how did police go from suspecting Murray and Jake, two hardened criminals with a direct connection to Nathan Blenner's car, to David and Willie? The link is an alleged gun dealer. When Jake was being interrogated by Butta, he told them that a guy from his neighborhood named James Johnson owned a gun that had been used in a murder. Butta then questioned Johnson, who said, "Willie Stuckey has my gun." He testified to this at trial. In exchange for that testimony, the police and the prosecution let Johnson off the hook for a very serious case that he was facing, and that was a huge, huge deal in Johnson's favor, obviously. Ray: If it wasn't for Johnson's story about the gun, David and Willie never would have been picked up. We don't know if this was the same gun that killed Nathan Blenner because they never found a gun. Oscar: Here was Stuckey, in jail. The police officer says to him, "Where is the gun?" The police officer goes to the bedroom and doesn't find the gun and never finds the gun. So why would Stuckey truthfully confess to murder but then lie about where he hid the murder weapon? Ray: And that's how absurd this case is. It's all hearsay. We looked everywhere for James Johnson. Oscar and I went to a bunch of old addresses. We're looking for a guy named James Johnson. Used to live up on the third floor. Oh, it's empty? So that's a dead end. ♪♪ But Van received new information on a person who we believed was the guy we'd been looking for. ...6. There you go. Van: Are you familiar with David McCallum? Well, this -- we were looking at, um... Did you testify in 80 -- in '86? The year that's in question would be like '85, '86. You was incarcerated then? Ray: We checked the records, and it was true. At the time of the trial, this guy was in jail under a completely different name. We kept looking, but there are more than a dozen other James Johnsons in the New York justice system, all about the right age. ♪♪ Van: Hello. I'm looking for James Johnson. The only good thing about searching for a guy with such a common name is that there's always the next James Johnson. So the search continues, and it won't stop until we find our guy. ♪♪ So, David's fourth parole hearing is rapidly approaching, and every year, he has to decide whether or not to admit guilt and remorse, which we think would give him a better chance of getting out. As his lawyer, I have to let him know what the options are that he has to getting out of jail. And I said, "You know, David, there may come a time where it's in your best interest to just wave the white flag." I've thought about it, and I could not see myself sitting in front of anyone and admitting guilt in this crime. I-I can't do it, and I won't do it. And if it takes... dying in prison, I would do that. I just don't think it would be the right thing to do for me or for anyone that support me and care about me and -- and love me and -- and believe in me.

Straight this way. Ray: Our investigation was at a dead end, but then a new district attorney was elected in Brooklyn, and one of his promises was to look at wrongful-conviction cases in a completely new way. When I walked through the doors of this office in January, I inherited a legacy of disgrace with respect to wrongful-conviction cases. We have over 100 of these cases to review. Ray: With the old D.A., proof of innocence was the only way to get a wrongful-conviction claim back into court. But Ken Thompson set up a unit to actually reinvestigate some of these cases. I made a pledge to the people of Brooklyn, and my pledge was to put the guilty away, but, also, to make sure that our criminal-justice system was based on fundamental fairness. Ray: The D.A.'s office was flooded with claims of wrongful conviction, just like ours. But then in June of 2014, we got news that they were gonna reinvestigate David's case. Four long months later, they called to tell us that on October 15th, David was gonna get his day in court. [Woman laughs] Oscar: Glad? [Laughs] A handsome young man looking for you. [Laughs] Oh, man! [Laughter] Oh. How you feeling man? Great. [Laughs] Ray: It turned out that Murray's signed affidavit, along with the Rubin's plea, had been enough to pique the interest of the D.A. and get David's case to the top of the list. [Indistinct chatter] Woman: Case number 11 on the Park Court calendar. The People of the State of New York versus David McCallum and Willie Stuckey. For the defendant, Oscar Michelen -- M-I-C-H-E-L-E-N. The defendants move that the defendants' constitutional rights were violated at trial and that the defendants have obtained newly discovered evidence. Man: Your Honor, the people do not oppose the motion. Since the only evidence was the statements against them, in which we have no confidence, we would ask the indictment to be discussed. Against this backdrop and the evidence available to the district attorney after the investigation sufficiently convinces the court that the judgments of conviction should be vacated and, based upon the people's further representation, that they possess insufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. I will dismiss the indictment. Thank you. [Applause] Whoo! [Cheering] We'll go down here. Let's walk down this way.
