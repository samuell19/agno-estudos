[Music] [Applause] hey [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey [Music] [Applause] fun we're here outside madison square garden for the 1979 world karate championships to my right one of the key organizers of the event aaron banks who earlier in the week created great controversy with his startling new remarks about the death of bruce lee aaron i wonder if you'd mind repeating some of your remarks for our tv audience well i believe bruce lee was murdered by something called the touch of death or the vibrating poem this is where a person can touch somebody in a particular area of their body in a way that can reverse or change the normal bodily functions the result is that within three or four weeks the person will drop dead so somebody was out to get bruce i think so perhaps he just was revealing too much of the chinese martial laws you know like taking the mystery out of it all the secret of karate is power internal power from the ear the vibrating palm how does it work it's internal power the chinese scriptures call it the chi the japanese call it the key it's heat that emanates from the poem right here i see and this palm is simply placed against any portion of the body and death will result in three to four weeks yes it could and no one would know what happened to the individual as in the bruce lee case corner there put the cause of death as misinvention now all misadventure means is that they really don't know what happened to the man the one thing we do know is that bruce wasn't too good of condition to die of natural causes and i wouldn't have been a freak injury because he knew exactly where he was what he was doing in terms of exercise now what portion of the body is this palm placed upon could be any part that's the yuri think about it it all depends on how strong the applied power is tell me something aaron are you able to do this i'd like to think so before he died bruce was experimenting with it and showed me the basic are prison saying then that bruce was starting to find out too much about the vibrating palm and therefore had to be silenced something like that one last question who do you think killed bruce lee i really don't know uh aaron aaron this is adolf caesar outside madison square garden for the 1979 world karate championships [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] peace [Music] this was the scene one year ago madison square garden world karate championships black belt champion bill louie is maneuvering for position against his opponent and then suddenly he grabs over the eyes and twists violently ripping them out from the sockets and in a dazzling piece of showmanship tossing them to the crowd hello i made off cesar here at ringside to bring you the 1979 world karate championships and the big question on everybody's mind is who will be bruce lee's successor and can he live up to the legend of the king of the martial arts for this evening's main event is the welterweight divisions championship which most experts agree will go a long way in determining the eventual successor to bruce lee however not everyone here agrees with that assumption and tonight and during the course of this show we'll talk to many guests feels no one has a right to claim bruce's king of kung fu title so stay with us it should be a fascinating evening but before i go any further let me say a word about the extra special significance of tonight's competition last week the tournament sponsors announced that they were dedicating this event to the memory and the martial arts legacy of bruce lee bruce lee perhaps the greatest karate expert of them all certainly the most influential in fact many of the guests here tonight owe their skills to bruce's dedicated training methods and his inspirational leadership so you better believe they'll be out there tonight giving there something extra in honor of their mentor shortly before he died i did a series of interviews with bruce and in them they show something of his philosophy of life and the martial arts they also reveal what a special person he was in this first one he talks about the mind in martial arts you must realize that 90 of the martial arts is mental agility and that your body is a weapon that can kill a man therefore you must use this mental power to control your actions so you're saying that the mind must be trained and conditioned as well as the body the mind must be cultivated so you can eventually know yourself well how do you cultivate your mind mental exercises such as what yoga and even zen meditation helps then you're performing almost a sort of self-hypnosis you make it sound so so mysterious and elusive but it's really not like that at all but would you mind elaborating more on that it's making the mind respond instinctively you do this by eliminating all variables and behavior but why all these variables bad they're too unpredictable well that should make it interesting such risks are counterproductive to everything you're trying to do [Applause] [Music] now as i mentioned earlier we have a title bout in the welterweight division later on however early in this week a note of controversy attached itself to this match as well as bruce lee himself aaron banks mr karate and a key organizer of tonight's match raised new questions about bruce's death in a series of interviews he gave this reporter among others his remarks not only enraged bruce's friends but also the managers of the two fighters who are fighting tonight here for the championship they were furious because banks later went on to imply that the touch of death would kill any heir apparent of bruce just as it did himself they called it a cheap trick to publicize the event and castigated banks for worrying their fighters on the eve of the match with what amounts to a death threat recently banks demonstrated to this reporter the basic principle behind the touch of death this is very difficult to do the kind of thing you get right away the problem is you have to generate power from such a short distance and really can't depend on any momentum you've got to concentrate concentration is everything so there we have it ladies and gentlemen the stage is set and tonight we'll have the answers to these questions who will be bruce lee's successor and will he meet the same fate as bruce a fate which aaron banks calls the touch of death we'll talk more about that later on but first let's take another look at a remarkable bout from the past this one hits ass bonnie lee against spreads of flying batman the flying fat man sure lives up to his name this is a comedian or free sparring match where the object is to score points by means of [Music] you can't get much more specific than that just behind me down by ringside is fred williamson looks like he's having a little trouble with his fans i wish i had that kind of trouble but seriously folks fred will be with us later on to talk about his feelings towards bruce lee and also this event so be sure to stay with us for that all fred almost didn't make it here it's quite a story uh how much time do we have five minutes okay let me divert for a second and tell you about it it all started around 10 a.m this morning [Music] [Music] what it's ten o'clock mr belafonte time to get up 10 o'clock wake up calls for 8 o'clock not 10 o'clock my name is not belafonte it's fred williamson two hours late damn that's what i'm paying 200 a day for huh i gotta be downtown in 20 minutes friend forget about it and get back under the covers yeah that's a nice idea baby butter i gotta get moving but why it's just a karate match that's all it is all right just a karate match somebody's got to be there to keep reminding him that that's all it is just a karate match i mean whoever heard of fighting for a bruce lee tyler don't even exist [Music] you've broken promises before last night you promised you'd satisfy me and here i am still wanting what i mean ain't five times enough for you oh fred let's make it a six-pack yeah i'll call room service and get one please [Applause] [Music] is you don't mind man i'm in a hurry this is my cab i was here first i know you're harry belafonte and all that but so what i'm jasper milk toast oh hey put me down hurry up come on where are you come on eight million people in new york and i gotta pick fred williams [ __ ] oh that'll stick well i'll just have to walk to plato's retreat [Music] this isn't my day first the hotel doesn't wake me up on time i can't find a cab and some clown tries to pick a fight with me well i'm a little late myself but nothing short of a death in the family is gonna make me miss this event yeah some event two guys fighting for bruce lee's title that don't even exist i mean that's kind of absurd look fred i just work for the tv networks i don't have anything to do with it i just call it like i see it yeah anything for high ratings huh i mean if they want higher ratings why don't they just put me in the ring with you save your anger for the tv cameras i'd like to get all of that in my interview it's not anger it's just professional concern but don't worry when the cameras roll so will i well put on your charisma my man your fans are waiting [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] wow harry belafonte but he made it despite 101 obstacles and distractions which would have deterred any less determined man so you better believe he's really psyched up for tonight's competition and hold it hold it just a second has it been a commotion around yes i do believe bill louie has just entered into the arena let's see if we can pick him up on one of our remote cameras bill lewis he's quite a showman and the crowd really loves him and with good reason too for he's one of our most exciting martial artists here he is in a demonstration from last year's event many people think of bill as a possible successor to bruce lee because of the strong physical resemblance and bill's mastery of the lee fighting form but don't let that fool you builds his own man with his own particular martial art style notice for example the lightning quick use of hands and feet karate fans watch this man he could be number one before long he certainly ranks up there on my list of karate champions an exclusive interview with international film star and martial arts magician ron van cleef live from a gym here in new york where ron is currently training in future defense of his world karate championship ron can you hear me good who would you say has been the most influential person in your life bruce lee and then in 1969 at the national championship he gave an exhibition we talked about martial arts he introduced me to the chinese style which developed my fluidity and flexibility [Music] he also got me into movies [Music] hong kong what he was doing into the dragon [Music] and you've come a long way since then i've been world champion three times twice in the middleweight and wants the light anyway i've also won 20 tournaments a year as a blackout ron tell me how did you get started doing this sort of thing of martial arts that is i've been involved in martial arts since 1955. my father told me judo and boxing one day i came home with a black eye you better learn how to defend yourself son one of the striking similarities between the two of you is the dedication you both have toward training and building up your body how many hours a day do you work out i train five hours a day seven days a week i do a thousand punches and kicks on the heavy bag every day [Music] [Applause] rigorous exercise is a must if your body is to be a weapon you know ron the question is often asked about him that if he had lived would he have been as great an action film star as say uh clint eastwood or uh charles bronson do you think he would have possibly been i don't think so he was really interested in television he wanted to get on the television series tell me do you think there will ever be anyone like bruce lee in terms of approaching his popularity i don't think anyone could be as popular as bruce wayne he was the prototype everyone else is an imitation i think everyone should develop their own style of the individual style uh one last question ron do you think bruce lee died of natural causes no way the blow he was seeking ahead could have been qualified any technique was swelling [Music] i believe he was murdered thank you ron this has been a most interesting conversation but before we return to our matches though i wonder if you could show us another demonstration of your skill next beat is what i call the test of courage i place two carrots on the necks of two of my students and i will attempt to cut these carrots without cutting the heads off well this should be something else are you ready incredible ron absolutely incredible would you mind doing that trick again i'm sure it was so fast some of our tv audiences missed it amazing [Music] look at her move she's got glass in the end hey baby what you doing later wow mommy stop wearing it hey babe wait up girls like that only cooking that's the tightest little ass i've ever seen she's good for only one thing [Music] as you heard me mention i was the first to spot bruce lee's talent but if the truth be told there were many signs of bruce's ability long before i came on the scene first of course there was the hereditary factor bruce's great grandfather was one of china's greatest samurai master swordsman of the 19th century a fact which takes on greater significance when one realizes that bruce was not only born under the same astrological sign as his great-grandfather but that he was born on the same day also as a result his birth itself was an omen an omen that became harder to disassociate himself from as he grew up reading stories of his great ancestors legendary heroics heroics that could not fail to influence a young boy's mind [Applause] huh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] bye [Applause] [Applause] uh after his 18th birthday when his older brother returned home to visit after a long absence [Music] things haven't been the same since you've left park the car around the back okay [Music] yesterday i learned some terrific maneuvers in karate class sue hey bruce bruce jack sue it's my brother he's come home jack it looks like he's been training again [Music] ah yes he practices every day kung fu is his whole life it worries her mother very very much she doesn't know what to

you so upset over my happiness ah your brother has some explaining to do no brother [Music] well whose fault was it nobody's you have a short memory who was it that plastered his walls with karate posters i don't believe this don't let her bug you she does this to me all the time no kidding she doesn't know when to stop and pops just as bad i think they both enjoy it bruce how can you say that your mother still deserves some respect nothing's changed boy it's great to have him back isn't it [Music] ma are you feeling okay ma i wish you'd look at this from my side we're lucky to be the heirs

parents and i think she is too bright a future to throw it away on a lazy daydreamer like your son bruce so she's a good girl huh then what about the delivery boy that's nothing but gossip what proof do you have how dare you stain our family name with all these vicious and tasteless accusations either back up what you're saying or i'll expect an apology from you this very instant before i apologize take a look at this letter that i just happen to have chuck last night was great let's do it again love sue my sister she wrote all of this so you see your sister isn't the angel you thought her to be is she how dare you dad what are you saying shut up you've said enough i'm warning you if you spread that letter around i'll kill you i swear to it i'll kill you in your rotten son his father realized that bruce was driving everyone karate crazy and felt it was time to have it out with bruce once and for all we know we must clear the air well it's about time now i'll be able to sleep at night i hope so ah then you won't be such a royal pain in the ass right ah bruce tell me why do you like to hurt your mother but i love mother love your mother ah you do nothing but bring her grief and sorrow you know if he'd been taught to respect us at an early age this wouldn't have happened ah what's happened to today's youth gone to hell papa do you mean to tell me that you never wanted to be like great-grandfather a samurai warrior the greatest samurai he was the king of them all oh i guess i thought about it once or twice then you understand papa i want this more than anything in the world it's my whole life i want to be the best so you want to be the greatest don't you remember what i told you about the touch of death and i would haunted and destroyed your great-grandfather sure but that's nothing but a lot of superstitious mumbo-jumbo so you really think so huh do you realize your great-grandfather's death is still a mystery huh they found a buyer outside his body and face all distorted that's what the martial arts did to your great-grandfather he never had any peace [Music] ah [Music] i'm is [Music] he will always have to defend himself it wasn't me to be otherwise all this talking has made me hungry it's time i had some lunch always eating is that all you can think of i'm hungry but what about bruce well it's something to consider give me some time to think thank you for understanding papa does that mean i can continue studying martial arts well i don't know well then can i go to the matches this afternoon karate matches why of course karate matches oh too i won't know can i have something to eat for lunch please this is your lunch [Music] what's this consummate doctor's orders consummate can you bring me a steak how do you want it medium rare you know it's no good for you get it uh-huh papa like i was saying before if i could go to the match about these stupid matches will you and you stop your sulky now uh bruce did you finish your homework assignment on the art of the ming dynasty well it's almost done come to your room yes sir right now could i do it tonight it should have been finished yesterday please honorable father no [Music] so so oh jack have you seen sue i think she went to the movies she should be back pretty soon gee that's odd we had a date this afternoon so driving you crazy with all that karate talking although jack understood what sue was going through she still sought other advice so she went to the wise old caretaker who had long served the lee household to understand bruce's obsession with his martial arts ancestry it all began long ago in a remote village where there lived an exciting samurai warrior a real legend a living champion [Applause] uh uh [Applause] hey [Music] what oh yes and he was known as the greatest fighting warrior throughout the land but his family was forever cursed however that's only one side of the story for it wasn't long before bruce's great-grandfather tired of killing and settled down with his wife and child to a peaceful existence this piece was often disturbed for his reputation attracted many who sought his assistance listen chan general hai's death has created an important vacancy on our council which i wonder if you will consider taking the fringe benefits are nice and you'll be adequately furnished with the house of your own you'll be accountable only to his highness with you on the couch [Music] you're quite generous your highness yet i must refuse if i go on there'll be no end to it there's been too much bloodshed please i wish you to have this sword to protect your highness i would deem it an honor if you would here i rather think you should reconsider for others may surely want to challenge you there is really nothing to be considered no disrespect intended your highness our house is here as it happens we are thinking of retiring i shall have my house to attend to wild my husband will fish bruce's ancestor chan lee spent the next five years living a sheltered existence that calm though was shattered when he confronted another in an endless parade of warriors who wanted to challenge him [Music] oh [Music] forgive the intrusion tangent asks me to extend to you his warmest greetings chan dan chan i don't know the jungle [Laughter] meanwhile back at chan's house things were heating up your name is chan the gentleman thinks that we're just playing no quite the contrary stop that you're here you take us for idiots he's because that's right you mustn't be angry with her lucha you might get the little girl mad at her she just needs a little gentle prodding that's all and she'll come with us peace meal isn't that so lucha why do you always ask me let's show this little man who we are we are the warriors known as the hc monster let us show everything or two [Music] [Music] [Applause] what happened she was attacked quite brutally they came to your house no no i'm leaving home what i'm running away from home jack it's the only way to follow in the footsteps of great grandpa and so bruce with nothing more than the clothes on his back left home to pursue his dream never to return again father i i know it's bruce he's gone he left me a note this morning i never thought it would have come to this and he had such a promising future but all that is nothing more than a dream to us now nothing more than just a dream [Music] a waste such a terrible waste papa it was bruce's decision to do this oh it's all your fault why did you have to come home again all i did was open old wounds well but he followed your example and ran away but papa but what i tried yeah you tried oh no tried like hell no more for those crazy ideas about inner peace that you brought home from the big city of god knows where you crazy kid [Music] papa let's drop it all no way sorry uh-huh perhaps you'd like to forget it was your fault too well he's on his own now i guess like you wanted i don't think you ever really understood him i knew it just had to end this way maybe he'll find the happiness he seeks he certainly didn't find it here yes [Music] maybe it was my fault and through judging him let our ancestors do that after all it's their reputation he has to live up to his fate is now in their hands ah [Music] huh [Music] [Applause] okay [Music] oh hey [Music] he has a lot to live up to perhaps too much i hope he finds happiness well there's nothing upon leaving home bruce visited several hong kong film studios trying to find work as a martial arts performer he knew this was the fastest way to build a reputation and gain the respect needed to become a samurai soldier of fortune like his great ancestor he had no luck until one day what can i do for you mr lee do you have a job for me in your picture it depends uh what can you do i can do karate i'm also a practic aikido kung fu some of this stuff involves stunt work can be pretty dangerous will your family approve my family has no say in the matter i hope you're not one of those spoiled kids who thinks it's too important to get his hands dirty there's no way then you've got the job now like i told you some of this stuff is pretty dangerous you'll have to do a lot of hand-to-hand combat three or four guys are gonna jump you at one time if you don't know what you're doing you're going to get seriously hurt now i'm not promising you anything this is a low budget chinese picture but if it turns out okay you'll get some international exposure now what i understand the thing together is some sort of comic strip performance which features a martial arts character so if you play your cards right i could get an audition possibly a contract to appear in american pictures yeah sure and become more famous than my ancestors right kid but one thing let's get this picture done first now take this card come to this address tomorrow morning and we'll have the wardrobe departure ready with your new clothes bruce did that film and he did it well he was a natural talent with a tremendous charisma that movie cameras were able to capture here he is in a scene from that film [Music] after that roll he was as the producer promised given a screen test for american television bruce lee screen test take one the results were overwhelming and bruce was immediately given a hollywood contract this was important or it gave him the credibility he needed to be able to speak out on the martial arts yet though bruce was widely respected by his peers he never did feel at home amidst the tinsel and glamour of hollywood all he really wanted was to popularize his great-grandfather's fighting techniques and he felt the fastest way to do this was to become one of the world's most respected action-oriented film stars american audiences got their first exposure of bruce during the run of the green hornet tv series meanwhile he was expanding during these early years he created many memorable characters the most popular of which was undoubtedly cato [Music] seems like there's nothing happening around here today [Music] ain't nothing happening here today [Music] hey look at that check it out [Music] [ __ ] [ __ ] cantaloupe tits i sure love to get my hands on some of that what are you waiting for come on hey let's get the guys [Music] [Music] hey i got a tenant surprise for you baby [Music] oh [Music] it [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] guys have no who's this clean cut and bright eyes you really shouldn't have done that hey baby [Applause] [Applause] oh [ __ ] i'm getting the [ __ ] out of here [Music] i don't think my friends wouldn't like that [Applause] [Music] footprints you're asking for it mother don't get it man come on come on come on come on let's get this sucker let's get it [Music] [Music] ah [Applause] [Music] [Music] so wow [Music] i believe this is yours why thank you who are you anyway the name's louie phillip thank you so much i'd like to stay but uh duty colts [Music] who was that master said his name was louis bill louie that bill louis interpretation of cato suggests another interesting aspect of bruce's career namely the incredible amount of emulation that bruce lee inspired few stars in any medium have been copied as frequently as bruce some of the imitators were remarkably good but none ever captured the spirit and charisma of bruce's personality witness for example this clip of bruce lie perhaps the most famous lee imitator although the moves are technically accurate the power is noticeably absent let us gain more light into this the key area of bruce's personality from one of his friends aaron banks you knew bruce well around this time what was he like we met while he was doing the green hornet he was a great guy with a fine sense of humor and he was always experimenting with new things in the martial arts uh when you got together what did you two discuss well we spend most of our time complimenting each other about our various accomplishments all finished that's quite a scrapbook you're really accomplished a lot thank you but i don't think so you've done more in a few years than most men have done in a lifetime don't you agree nope aaron it's you who've done a lot you're the number one promoter of martial arts in the world no bruce it's you who's been the number one promoter of martial arts hey while we're here come on show me that uh new maneuver you've been working on occasionally though uh you would show me one of the maneuvers he was working on watch closely aaron it's a very fast and deadly maneuver that is a pretty sharp maneuver it's something i've been working on for a while my friend is it related to the touch of death principle you recently rediscovered a variation of it hustle psychological get it very much what are you smiling at aaron that looks just like what one of my students at the credit king on it because i showed it to him for the extra work you added really gives it a whole new dimension you better believe it splits the attention it's really meant to distract you aaron can i teach it to the fighters i train even though you're the best handler of fights around i don't think so if that's the way you feel i'll go along with it one hundred percent so you see bruce was really a very good nature interesting glimpse of bruce's square decide i know you have to get back to the table so i won't keep you any longer thank you so there you have it the bruce lee story the early years told by the people who knew him a colorful story which gives great insight into an often ignored but nevertheless a critical part of his life big match this one featuring the incredible skill of terry yuka higa and his okinawa kempo karate academy higa is highly respected by his peers for his insistence on maintaining the traditional aspects of martial arts yet despite this he always manages to thrill his audience with some exciting new delay like the one you're seeing now it just goes to show you that the traditional and innovative can find a happy marriage in the martial arts and now let's look at the scene right out of that i am a fugitive from a karate change look at those attackers go at it there's no love lost there now kids i know this looks like a lot of fun but i don't advise you do this without parental supervision it can be very dangerous [Applause] and now let's watch as a couple of higas students engage in a little freestyle sparring you've undoubtedly noticed that they look somewhat like fences but all that protection is necessary for a stray kick can be just as dangerous as a sharp blade this is a very good exercise in developing timing balance and overall coordination higa is a strong proponent of stressing the basics and the skills of his students reflect that eager students are setting up for their next demonstration but what's this the proud appreciation for the marvelous show he's put on is giving him a rousing ovation listen to those fans but he does not want to rest on his wall and he's already out there for his next demo this is a two-on-one attack using sticks look at those moves reflex is so quick that his own body doesn't know what he's going to do next and now in keeping with his tension for innovation he has prepared a real treat for us tonight a beat never before performed in the united states the crowd can sense the significance of this there's an electricity in the atmosphere that's hard to describe higa is readying himself now as his assistant places the sledgehammer the other students are leaving the ring area to avoid any distraction and to give everyone the best possible view the nervous excitement fills the air assistant this stroke very carefully the slightest miscalculation could shatter he goes on beyond repair if this goes as planned higa's arm will split the boards in half while itself withstanding injury he's done it but wait he's not just yet there are still some boards unbroken they set up quickly yes the remaining boards are shuttered [Music] you can see how emotionally draining that was but let's hope eager can summon the strength to take one last bow with his students in front of this appreciative crowd that terry yuka giga he's really something else don't you think so fred i don't know as i mentioned earlier not everyone here this afternoon feels that this afternoon's bout will accurately determine bruce lee's successor many feel that there's no way anyone can make such a claim to bruce's title perhaps the most vocal of these people is the man sitting here next to me i'm speaking of course about international film star and former pro football player fred williamson fred would you mind repeating some of your views for our tv audience well these are not just my views at all these are the facts and the fact is that this match is just another fight between two good karate fighters i mean it's an insult to bruce lee but think that either one of them could succeed well tell me what about your martial arts background do you think you're as good as bruce lee why should i have to be and why should they and bruce lee was great at what he did i'm fantastic at what i do but you're avoiding the questions what about the martial arts do you really feel that you have the skills necessary to live up to bruce's reputation look adolf i do all of my karate fighting in all my films i do all my stunts i mean they didn't call me the hammer for nothing well fred you do present a most convincing argument but as we both know it's the public that decides these things and it's been the public who has labeled this match the one that will determine bruce's successor well unfortunately there's nothing i can do about that but i feel that in order to achieve the success that bruce lee reached one has to be physically developed as well as mentally developed i mean these two things have to become one but in the meantime we'll see one of my movies and you know what i'm talking about well thank you very much fred williamson for your observations and good luck in your quest to be the best i don't let's get back to some ring [Music] action [Applause] karate fans will recognize that man in red white and blue as richie varate what's this one of his sparring partners appears to be hurt looks like barathe put a little too much power into that kick the fighters do wear protective padding but that's not much protection against that kind of brute force fortunately for this fellow he can manage to walk away from a kick like that that's probably the worst stomach ache you'll ever have but seriously folks he appears to be okay bharathi also looks to be regaining his composure something he'll really need to do because they're now setting up for richie's main attraction [Applause] is fast becoming a household name as a result of his recent appearances on the johnny carson show it was there he smashed 13 flaming boards to pieces with a hammer fist incurring in the process serious third-degree burns he won't be performing that trick tonight not because he's afraid but because his doctors have forbidden it in order to compensate for this cutback though he's added another board bringing the total to 14. if he smashes this it will be a new world's record and water would be especially considering the handicaps he's had to overcome for instance when he was two he lost the sight in one eye in a tragic accident loss of sight in an eye means a reduction of depth making even simple acts of coordination very difficult over the years his peers have been amazed at his ability to maintain control over his techniques without dental perception another handicap has been a serious blood disease he's had since he was 17. it's dormant now but he's had to suffer through heart attacks and for long periods of incapacitation in learning to live with it he's just about ready to begin so we better lower our voices as the height of concentration is [Applause] required [Applause] come on he's done it he's done it a new world's record richard j baratheon has beaten the best he has every right to feel proud listen to those fans they know what he's had to go through to reach this moment [Music] [Applause] [Music] well there's not much you can do for an encore after that except just pick up the pieces and now it's time for the big two in the big one the main event for the welterweight full contact karate championship of the world louis neglia versus john's not much discussed in the press this week because of its claim to be the determinant of bruce lee's successor and much discussed because of the entire touch of death controversy with surroundings here we seek not only a winner but an answer to the following question will that winner in succeeding groups also inherit his so-called purse then we two losses in full contact and now look at blood he appears to be coming on strong with a series of up-protection accommodation flurries negligence waiting for an opening watch out cyclone niglia's feet have his attention too and there it is even though flood is the champion nigley is the crowd favorite tonight because he's literally fighting in his own backyard having been born and raised in brooklyn hey look at this exchange [Applause] there's the bell ending round one boy that was some exchange it's hard to imagine how someone can last through 10 rounds of that by the way each round is scored on a 10-point must system with three judges the referee not being allowed to score word is apparently coming down from the press box that neglia won the first round on a split decision two of the judges going with neglia and one with blood [Applause] [Applause] the referee is giving him a mandatory account and flood says he's okay [Music] [Applause] this is turning into one pillow [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Applause] uh [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the garden is empty now the fighters have gone home the building is closed for the night what have we discovered from all this a new champion perhaps a successor to bruce lee i doubt it well you see what most heir appearance to bruce seem to forget is that to be the best you must beat the best and bruce lee was the best and he can no longer be beaten so all else is just speculation and i for one am glad but why should we try to topple his legacy its existence i think has such a positive influence to sum it all up i cannot help but recall ron van glee's remark about bruce he was the prototype everything else is just an imitation [Applause] the secret of karate is power internal power from the air the vibrating car how does it work it's internal power i don't think anyone is part of this some of this stuff involves networking can be pretty dangerous the best fighter there is i can whip anyone i can kill with my bare hands in order to achieve the success that bruce lee reached one has to be physically energy [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] six to five [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] come on [Applause] [Music] [Applause] um [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh
