(tense music) (Billie whimpering) - [Ms. Dario] Billie. Billie. Billie, we're going to get help. (Billie cries) (blood squirts) (Billie laughs) (tense music) (Billie laughs) (footsteps tapping) (Billie laughing) (crows cawing) (static buzzing loudly) (tense orchestral music) (fabric rustling) (birds chirping) (keys jangling) (door clanking) (keys jangling) (footsteps thudding) (keys jangling) (hand knocking) - Enter. - (sighs) Ms. Tyler. The bridge is down. We're stuck here, and there's six girls I find. - Yes, I know. (keys jangling) - Well, what's our plan? - I've spoken to the mayor, and he assures me that the bridge will be back open in 48 hours. The girls can roam in the building all they want, but responsibility for them is with you. Is that understood? (somber piano music) - Tyler's last two. I love it when she gets all edgy without them. - Mm. Yeah, great idea. Make her more pissed off with everyone. - Just 'cause Daddy isn't sending you a helicopter this time. Chill out, Billie. - Now, now, just 'cause your parents didn't take you abroad doesn't mean you need to take it out on Billie. - Mm-hmm. - My dad's got a helipad on all his hotels. He just doesn't let me ride in them. I just think he's cheap. - Well, I actually don't like them. It feels weird being all high in the open like that. - Yeah, speaking of, if we have to spend the whole weekend with one mini bottle of vodka and two cigarettes, I'm gonna kill myself. - Oh, hang on a minute. I think I know someone who will have something. - The mayor's office? (Steph chuckles) - Shut up. That girl, Meadow. - (gasps) Yeah, she's exactly the kind of person who'd have something. Kim, you should go talk to her. - Why me? - Well, 'cause you love to talk, and honestly you could do with a walk. - Catch up on all your brother's stuff. - He's pretty hot, to be fair. (footsteps thudding) (shoes clacking) (bottles clinking) - What are you doing? - Clearing up. - You gonna share it? - Depends, what do you got? Oh wow, a whole cigarette. Guess you want McCullum's stash of tobacco. - No weed? - He's not that cool. - Well, are you gonna dish it out? It's dangerous to use it on a Saturday you know. - Finders keepers. You can go. - You know, me, Steph and Billie were thinking we should all hang out. Even those other girls, forget their names. We're all stuck here, may as well make it fun. - Fun how? - You know fun. Make Mrs. Tyler think we're haunted. Tell scary stories. Drink that wine maybe. Fun things. - This is the most you've ever spoken to me. - Well, needs must. Got a phone signal? - I don't have a phone. - You know, between me and you, the others think you are kind of crazy. Not me though. I can vibe with that with that Wiccan energy. - The only ones who can vibe with that are the ones who left me in this dump of a school. 'Cause I'm not allowed to contact my family till I'm 18. - Intense. - Very. - That where you got that knife? - What knife? - I've seen it. Totally cool, by the way. You do you, just, you know, don't kill us. - You want to see it? - Kind of. - Well, tough. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go lock myself away with my goodies. - I know you've got more witch shit in that bag. We want in. Bring it to our dorm room later. It'll be fun. - Take your hand off my arm, or you're not gonna make it to your dorm room later. (Kim chuckles) (footsteps thudding) - [Woman] Meadow! Let me out, let me out. (mysterious music) You can help me. Hey, Denise. (mysterious grunting) (bell dinging) - [Overhead Announcer] Attention all students, please gather in the common room immediately for an address on the situation. (shoes clacking) (thunder rumbling) - We've received word from the girls who were collected, and they've all arrived home safe. But as we now know, the roads are closed. Nikki. - Do we still have to do our projects whilst we're here? - No. No, there's going to be no work this weekend. But that does not mean that you can shirk what's otherwise expected of you. This school is grounded in values that extend beyond the gate. So there is to be no bickering-- - If I might interrupt, Ms. Dario. We trust you girls implicitly. And you have a free reign over the building. Aside from the obvious areas of privacy. Ms. Dario will be our point of contact for you girls and will oversee the safety of the building. (thunder rumbling) (heels clacking) - So what did you guys wanna do now? - Are you getting anything? - No. - It's like the dark ages. I know you would know about that. (chuckles) - [Kim] Back to your lair, is it? (keys jangling) - You coming? - [Kim] Sneaky bitch. (Nikki coughing) - God, I think I'm gonna might need my inhaler in here. - Nikki. - Yeah. - You're not interesting enough to need an inhaler. - What is this place? It's gross. - Ms. Dario's office. (drawers sliding) - Seriously? - Yeah, I see her come in here all the time. Has she not heard of a Hoover? - Like the mayor's aide doesn't sweep up after you, Billie. - I don't think we should be in here. - Then leave. - Actually, I guess it's kind of cool. - [Woman] Meadow! - Did you guys hear that? - What? - I think I'm supposed to find something. They know my name. - So you hear voices? I was starting to think you were cool. - [Steph] You can't say that, you. - Who knows your name, Meadow? (tense music) - [Kim] What the hell is that? - Oh, is that Ms. Dario's diary? - No, that's actually really old. - Oh. - Kinda freaky. - [Steph] What a hard life she's lived. (women laugh) - My parents had a library of old texts, symbols and spells. Nothing like this. - Why would your parents have creepy stuff like that? - Well, it's my Mum. It's kind of her job to protect it. She sent me away 'cause she runs a commune of sorts. - So your Mum's a witch. Makes sense now. - Not a witch, a protector. (women laugh) I think they know I can help. - Help how? (voices muttering) Meadow? (shoes clacking) - What do you think you are doing? You should not be in that office! - Run of the school you said. Was that the actual boss? - [Ms. Dario] It was locked. - I guess not. - We're sorry, Ms. Dario. Will this affect our grades? - What's her name? - Pippa? - Pippa. Stop being such a bore. - I'm sorry for caring about my future. We can't all inherit hotels. - True. - The office is off-limits. - Ms. Dario, where did you get that book? - Salem. - Salem? - Mm-hmm. - In America? - Mm-hmm. - Like Salem with the witches? - Yes, Salem with the witches. - Witches? That's a witch's book? - No, this is not a witch's book. This is a book written by a group of protectors. At the end of the trials. - Trials? - The witch trials. - What trials were they for? To qualify for the Witch Olympics? - Innocent women were hung and tortured and burned alive because of the word of men. And even children were believed over them. If crops failed or an animal died or somebody woke up with a scratch, they blamed witches. The village of Salem tore itself apart through paranoia. - So why do you have it? I mean, shouldn't it be somewhere safe in a museum? - I wrote my own book on the history of witchcraft and how it was used as an excuse to torture and punish women. Have any of you been in my history of feminism through the ages class? - No, but I'd really like to. - I went to Salem for my research, and I found this book buried. - Buried where? - The very first woman to be tried for witchcraft in Salem was a lady named Bridget Bishop. - They lock her in the book? - I found this book buried at the site where she was hung. Something, something drew me there, girls, a connection. And I was on my knees, digging in the dirt. Bridget Bishop was not a witch when she was accused. Nobody ever was. And they hung, and they tried so many. And when Bridget was hung, everything changed. The misguided hatred and prejudice against Bridget had consequences for them all. Evil and innocence came together and awoke a new kind of demon. (Bridget choking) They accused Bridget of bewitching young women. Her angry husband testified that he'd seen her biting and choking them. It was his word against hers, a lie, but this demon made it real. One by one, the women of Salem were possessed by Bridget Bishop's damned soul. It was pure evil searching for hosts. It was the birth of witches. (solemn music) So the last woman accused of witchcraft in Salem was burned at the stake in 1693. And her ashes are pressed into this book. With spells that were written and bound by the protectors to hold Bridget's soul and keep the curse at bay. She was innocent, but her soul is trapped. And I've been researching this book to try and free her soul. - You actually believe all this? - You don't? - Oh, come off it. How convenient, witch Meadow finds it when we're all stuck here alone with nothing to do. Thanks for the creepy story, Ms. Dario. Really passed the time. Are you coming? - I don't care if it's a story. I still wanna hear what happened. - So how do you think you can help this Bridget? - There is one ritual, but the only way to activate it is to mix the ashes in this book with some special blood. - [Kim] Oh for God's sake. (hand taps) - Special? - I'm B-positive. - The people of Salem had help from outsiders who were able to hold back the evil energy while the last witch burned. Now, there have been offshoots over the years, but these were originals of what we call Wiccans. Now, it's their bloodline that is needed. If the ritual is to be started without their blood and without the powerful Wiccans overseeing it, then I don't think that would be all right. - So why are you keeping it? If it's as powerful and dangerous as you say, why haven't you found the protectors to keep it safe? - Maybe you should never have dug it up at all. Ms. Dario, I am sorry. - This, this is a discovery of a lifetime. I am hoping to be able to learn how to be able to help with the rituals. A bit selfish maybe, but I want to be able to help free Bridget's soul. (tense music) - Great. Well done, Meadow. - [Ms. Dario] Raiding the teacher's stash, are we? (rain pouring) - Ms. Dario, I think you need another drink. (giggles) Oh, here you go. - Ms. Dario. We love you for this, but are you okay? (women laugh) - These idiots. They buy me a bottle of wine every Christmas, every conference day, and, well, I've got nobody to drink it with. Go to your boots girls, go to your boots. - Didn't you have chatting with Mr. McCullum? Has he not asked you for a drink? - Oh, no. I had to drop something off at his house once, and he's built a little hut for his recycling bin. Oh, his idea of a fun weekend would be hiring a skip. (women laughing) - What's a skip? - Okay, who's next? - Meadow. Truth or dare? - [Meadow] I'm not saying. - Life of the party, as always. - Oh, sorry. Go carry on playing these stupid games. I was thinking about that poor woman. So unfair. - Oh God, it was like 100 years ago. Whatever. - Yeah, I bet you that she would be happy that women are free to drink, free to vote, and free to have their own businesses. Isn't that right, Ms. Dario? - Damn right. - Right, yeah! - Ms. Dario, truth or dare? - Dare. Dare me to lock that old witch Tyler in her office the whole weekend, please. - Ms. Dario, I think you've had too much to drink. Do you want me to get Ms. Tyler for you? - Who's the responsible adult here? It is me. Why don't we just have a little. (hiccups) A little lay down. (Ms. Dario mutters) (women chuckle) - That's our teacher. - She'll be fine. And you remember how much weed we have to try. - That's true. (women giggle) (somber music) (wine splashing) (somber music) (Ms. Tyler inhales) (Ms. Tyler exhales) (eerie music) (thunder rumbling) (Ms. Tyler inhales) (Ms. Tyler exhales) - Wanna do something useful? - With you? No, thanks. - What were you thinking? - We're gonna do that ritual. (thunder rumbling) - No, no, no, no, no. I don't think we should do that. - Been around Wiccan bullshit all my life. It can't be that difficult. Who's in? Oh, so you can listen to Dario yammer on and on, but you can't take a leap of faith and actually help someone? - [Kim] She's right, you know. Imagine Ms. Dario wakes up and we've stolen all her glory. I'm in. - [Billie] I thought you didn't believe in it. - [Kim] I don't. Dario does. (thunder rumbling) - Okay. - Oh, I'm going to bed. - [Kim] Steph, come on. - No, that shit's too real. I'm leaving it to you freaks. Goodnight. (lips smacking) - Right then. We ready? (somber music) (rain pouring) (thunder cracking) Tonight, Bridget Bishop's soul is purified and freed. No longer a servant of evil. No longer a pawn of the devil. No longer a curse. (suspenseful music) - Meadow, how did you get a dagger in the school? - It's not a dagger. It's an athame, and it's been in my family for generations. And I took it as a memento. - What does that symbol mean? - It means protection. I'm the one who can free Bridget. - I don't think we should do this. - Fire of the realms, hear me. On the honor of my bloodline, I sanction the freedom, protection and blessing of Bridget Bishop's soul for all time. (rain pouring) (thunder cracking) (suspenseful music) (mysterious breathing) (suspenseful music) (thunder cracking) (mysterious breathing) (suspenseful music) (thunder cracking) (rain pouring) With my blood meeting the ash of the lost, we shall begin. (mysterious breathing) (suspenseful music) - No! No. (mysterious muttering) (suspenseful music) (Meadow laughing) (suspenseful music) (Meadow laughing) (suspenseful music) No! (Meadow laughing) (suspenseful music) (crow cawing) (birds chirping) - Oh my God. It's like my hair is hurting. Mm. - What the hell happened last night? - Dario brought us all that alcohol. Guess that's what happened. (groans) - I feel awful. Why do people do this to themselves? - Welcome to not being a loser. Oh no, wait, you still are. What are you girls doing sleeping here anyway? Did I let you in? - I don't remember anything. - [Nikki] Me neither, Gemma. - Cool. So maybe go back to your own rooms now? - Kim, quit being such a bitch. - Steph, you good? Steph. - Steph! - Steph? (Steph shouts) (dramatic music) You're sick. - Gotcha. - Yeah, good one. Imagine if I'd had a heart attack. - Excuse me for having a good night's sleep. Oh, I love it when the weather's all horrible outside. - Steph. - Hmm? - Did you hear us come in last night? - Nope, I hibernate. But the lights did go a bit funny. Was there a power cut? - No, I don't think so. - Hmm. Well, usually Kim snoring keeps me up, so you guys must have passed right out. Do you reckon Ms. Dario could get into trouble for last night? - Hmm, good idea. (Steph chuckles) I think we had a good night though. - It was horrible. Who was it? I can't remember. It must have been... - Oh God. Remember Ms. Dario passing out. (women giggle) - [Kim] What a loser. (Steph chuckles) (hand knocking) (door creaking) (footsteps thudding) - Is everything okay? You know, there was some bad weather last night. Did you leave a window open in here? - No. - Okay. Would you like some breakfast being brought in? - No. - Okay. - How are the girls this morning? - Fine, they're fine. A bit shaken up by the weather maybe, but. - It's important to keep them safe. - Yeah, they're okay, they're fine. - It's so important to try. - They're fine. - Ms. Dario. Ms. Dario? Ms. Dario? (dramatic music) (footsteps thudding) (Billie laughs) Ms. Dario? - Hmm? - What time did we go to bed last night? - I am not your mother. - Well, as long as we're stuck here, I say that you are. - Do you have any more toast, Mum? (women chuckling) (Kim coughing) Oh, good one, Kim. Can you eat three more of those scones? (Kim coughing) - Are you okay? (Kim coughing) - Ms. Dario, help her. Oh my God. (dramatic whooshing) (Kim choking) (suspenseful music) (dramatic whooshing) (Kim choking) (Kim coughing) (chair legs scuffing) Ms. Dario, help her. Ms. Dario, help her. (Kim coughing) Oh my God, this is horrible. - Steph, pat her back. (Kim coughing) (suspenseful music) (Meadow coughing) (Kim coughing) - Oh my God, this is horrible. (Kim coughing) - [Woman] It was them. You know they did this. Too late. (woman laughing) (solemn music) - [Steph] Here you go. Maybe two next time. - There was someone stood there in a hood, and he's gone. - Where? - He was standing right behind you. - [Ms/ Dario] What kind of hood? - I don't know. It was a hood, a black hood. It looked cheap. - [Steph] Aw. (dramatic organ music) (Ms. Dario gasping) (mysterious breathing) (solemn piano music) - There's a presence, I can feel it. It's her, I know it is. Meadow, what have you done? - I don't know what I've... - You started the ritual, and you didn't finish it. - Who's her? - Bridget. - Oh, please. - Kim, you saw her for yourself. And so did I. - You did? - And now she's here, we've opened the gates. And she has brought with her such great danger, if we don't finish that ritual now. - I don't remember. I don't think I would've done that. - I don't think Meadow would've done that either. Especially not after what you told us about the book. You wouldn't do that, Meadow. Would you, Meadow? - But I saw you. (mysterious whispering) (mysterious breathing) (dramatic whooshing) (woman whimpers softly) (birds chirp) I also warned you about the book, and I don't know if I can stop it. - It was Kim. - What? - You think I would read that ritual? Haven't even read Harry Potter. - She hasn't. - You spiked us. I saw you. Why would you do that to us? - Is that true? - No, it's not true. If anyone spiked anyone, it's Meadow. I've seen the weird shit you've been carrying around in that bag. - Shit I would not waste on the likes of you! - Girls, enough! - She let Steph go to sleep so she could spike us all. She hates us! - I think it was you that made me choke! What did you put in my food? What did you do to me? - I think we should get Ms. Tyler. - You love the attention so much, Kim. Why is that? Is that 'cause Mummy and Daddy sent you away? (Kim mutters) - We are here together, we work together. We stay together, understood? - [Steph] Guys, she's right. - Everyone knows you're jealous of me and Steph. Except the mayor can't pay us off to be your friend. (women shouting) (suspenseful music) - Enough! Calm down. (footsteps thudding) - What if she's busy? - You do it then. She likes you more than me anyway. She does. Yeah, sure. (hand knocking) - Excuse me, Mrs. Tyler. (hand knocking) (door creaking) (suspenseful music) - We need to finish the ritual. And Meadow's going to get the book from the box. 'Cause she needs to read it. Girls, we need to work together. We need to work together and stay focused. Fair? We stand a chance. - So what if we don't stay focused? - That is not an option. Meadow, Bridget's soul is at stake here. Everything that happened at Salem will happen here if we do not act. Something terrible could happen. - I know I can't do it. - Meadow, you're a strong woman. I've watched you grow. We're are all so, so proud of you. - I'm not. - I will be by your side. You started this ritual alone, Meadow. None of us could have withstood that. We'll be ready this time. - My mother sent me away because she knew I wasn't ready. - [Ms. Dario] Who is your mother? - As far as I'm concerned, I'm here by myself. - [Kim] No change there then. - Do you never get tired of being a sarcastic bitch? - No. - You see me in class too, you're just the same. Always trying to put everyone down. Why is that? And you, following her around like a lost little puppy. You're just as bad. - What, what the hell did I do? - You can all sit here and hold hands till morning. Leave me alone. - [Ms. Dario] Meadow, Meadow! - Jesus Christ, thank God for that. Freak. - [Ms. Dario] Girls, we need Meadow's help. - Yeah, well I'm not gonna go get her. She'll scurry back. - Billie, do you need a second to calm down? (dramatic music) (Billie gasps) (Billie whimpers) - Look who's taken the freak crown. (dramatic organ music) Freak. - Billie? (dramatic organ music) (Billie cries) (blood squirting) (Billie laughing) (dramatic organ music) (footsteps tapping) (Billie laughing) (suspenseful music) - Where is she? Surely she's not outside in this cold. Do you think she heard the noise? - She's left her laptop plugged in. - Well, she'll be back in a minute then. Gemma, what are you doing? - Wanna know your predicted grades? - Gemma! You can't do that. - Come on, just a peek. It'll get my dad off my back. (mysterious whirring) - Ms. Tyler. (dramatic music) (woman choking) (man grunting) (woman choking) (body thudding) - Nikki? (papers rustling) - Where is it? Where is it? - [Ms. Tyler] That won't help you. (suspenseful music) - Nikki? (suspenseful music) (mysterious muttering) - Hey, Meadow. - How did you get in here then? - It won't help you. - Nikki. - Kim, you're not funny. No one thinks you're funny, you're just a bitch. Kim? - It won't help you. - You all right? - Who's there? - Don't. (Gemma choking) (Gemma choking) - Your research. Without intimate knowledge and providence, you cannot truly harness the power of the book. - You know about the book? My research, did you find my research? Where is it? - It's gone. - Gemma, oh my God! Gemma! - My journal with rubbings of symbols and spells. That is unique. - It won't help you. - Where has it gone? - It won't help you. (Nikki whimpering) - I couldn't stop. I could see her, she wanted me to stop. - Was someone here with you, Nikki? Did they make you? - It told me to watch. - Who did? (dramatic whooshing) (suspenseful music) (mysterious whooshing) - I think I need to leave. - I think, I think I need to go. (suspenseful music) - We'll all go. We can finish this together. You need to go downstairs, Nikki. Nikki, you need to go downstairs. (Nikki whimpers) Nikki, don't listen to them. Focus on me. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (dagger squelching) (suspenseful music) - There's no other way. - They won't let me forget. (Billie coughs) (Nikki coughs) (dagger squelching) - Nikki! (Nikki groans) (Nikki gasps) (Nikki groans) (Nikki cries) - Meadow. Help me. (groans) (suspenseful music) (Billie coughing) (suspenseful music) (footsteps tapping) (suspenseful music) - I'm sorry. (dramatic music) (hand knocking) - I'm decent. That means come in. (hand knocking) (mysterious muttering) Oh, ha-ha, Kim. Very funny. (door slamming) Bunch of idiots. I'm not scared, you know. (dramatic whooshing) (mysterious breathing) (suspenseful music) (dramatic whooshing) (suspenseful buzzing) - Kim. - What? Billie, if that's you, it better be to apologize. - [Meadow] She's here. - What do you want? (door creaking loudly) (door creaking) Steph, you in there? (suspenseful music) (Kim crying) - Okay, we need to get everybody downstairs, girls. Once everybody is safe, girls, and we get the book, we breathe and we fight back, okay? Meadow, it's okay. Come in. (solemn piano music) It's Steph. I am so sorry. - There's no blood in here. - No. - Nikki. Gemma. - What have you done? - Nikki hurt herself. Over Gemma, I think. You listen to me. - Where are they? - Mrs. Tyler's office. - Okay, where is Mrs. Tyler? Hey girls, I'm gonna go find Mrs. Tyler. Girls, take a moment and then you need to lock the rooms. And these are off-limits. I need to get the books and come downstairs, but you are not to start anything without me. Is that clear? (suspenseful music) (mysterious muttering) (suspenseful music) Bridget? (suspenseful music) - We should go now. (suspenseful music) - Just need to wait for Dario to get back, and then we can fix this. - It's a bit late for that now, isn't it, Meadow? - It's not too late for us three. - [Woman] You don't have time. - Did you hear that? - What? - [Woman] He killed them all. - What are they talking about? - Dario's the one losing it, right? - [Woman] She did what she had to do. (dramatic music) (footsteps thudding) (dramatic whooshing) - You ignored her. - What? - Deaf? She asked you to go with her. If you'd have gone, none of this would've happened. - Kim, that's not fair. - I bet she killed Gemma and Nikki too. I know you hate me, Steph. You were always jealous of us. - Just stop! - She killed Gemma and Nikki, I know it. - It wasn't Billie. She didn't have anything to do with this. I saw what happened. Nikki killed herself in front of me. Gemma was dead when I got there. - She's only saying that now because she knows she's been caught. - It didn't hurt anybody. It wasn't my fault. I started the ritual. I didn't know what was gonna happen. Dario is right. There's something else here. A presence. - Billie, we need to get away from her. - Three of our friends are dead. Because you started this trial. - I thought I could handle it. - No one can handle it. You were there as well, Billie. You could have saved her. You were too scared. (Billie whimpers) (suspenseful music) - Audrey. You need to come inside. Something, something terrible's happened. I tried to help her. I didn't notice anything. Oh God, what kind of teacher am I? She was a kind, a beautiful person underneath it all. Couldn't help. Those girls needed me, and I failed. - [Ms. Tyler] I know. - Know what? - She killed those girls. Steph, Nikki, Gemma. - Who killed them? - I trusted you to take care of them. - Huh? How do you know? - She will not stop until we all have felt her pain. There's nothing more you can do. She did need help, desperately, but you made it worse. You started something you didn't understand. You let that witch return to take control. - Meadow was trying to help too. - You found the book. You took the book. The responsibility is with you, no matter how much you push back. Blame yourself. (tense music) (suspenseful music) I'm not here anymore. (suspenseful music) (gasoline splashing) (canister clanking) (lighter clicking) (flame whooshing) (suspenseful piano music) (footsteps thudding) (suspenseful piano music) (Billie breathing heavily) (footsteps thudding) (suspenseful piano music) (witch laughs) (footsteps thudding) (door creaking) (door banging) (footsteps tapping) (suspenseful music) (footsteps tapping) - No! No! (Kim cries) (footsteps tapping) (Kim panting) - Tell me what's happened. - It's Meadow. This is all her fault. She killed Steph, I know it. - Then we need to go downstairs. We need to finish the ritual. - No. What about Meadow? - I'll deal with her. - Help me, cry me strength, fire mother, my blood. I know I'm supposed to help them, but how can I? I'm sorry. I just wanted to prove I could do it. I thought the curse would lift as soon as my blood hit the page. What it did was open the gate. Open the gate, and it took all of you. (suspenseful music) (dramatic whooshing) (dramatic music) - The gate is open, but still I am prisoner. - Tell me what I should do. - You should wait. Evil will never cease. Not until the last vessel is claimed. You should wait, for if it is you, you shall live eternal. If not, you shall be the last here to die. The last and the one that stands accused. - I can finish the ritual. - The ritual will only delay. Death is inevitable. We are the witches that cannot die. (sheet rustling) (suspenseful music) - Billie? Oh Billie, you're doing so well. Oh my goodness, you are freezing. Have you been outside? (suspenseful music) When we lose somebody close to us, Billie, they leave a little mark on us that keeps them alive. You know, I truly believe that, girls. You are so strong, Billie, and you've worked hard for that yourself. Steph would be proud. You know, she's part of that strength, Billie. In sisterhood, there is power. Remember that, girls. Never forget. - There, there, little Billie. You're all right. You're one of us. - Meadow, do you have the book? (suspenseful music) The book? - It's her fault. She killed them! You killed them! (women shouting) - Stop! No. (eerie music) (suspenseful music) - It was both of them. They conspire. They both wanted this. - What now? - How about a gag? - You cannot silence me. You both know it was you. Soon everyone will know. - She can't help this. That's not Billie. - But it is Billie? - We need to finish this ritual now before she can do anymore harm. - Ritual won't do anything. - Well, it's the best that we've got, Meadow. What would you prefer that we do, nothing? - Maybe we just let it take her. - And then what? Let it take everybody else when they arrive here tomorrow? (Billie laughs) - Yes! Bring more. (laughs) - Okay. Okay, I'll do it. - But we need the book. Mrs. Tyler, she must have buried the book before she... I am going to find it. (suspenseful music) - Can I come with you? - I'll be fine. - Meadow, I'm counting on you. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (Meadow groans) (weapon clanks) (Billie cries) - Billie. (Billie cries) Billie. (Billie cries) (Billie laughs) (blood squirting) Billie. (blood squirting) (Billie laughs) - What if this doesn't work? You know, when it was controlling me, I could see and feel everything, but I wasn't in control. What must that have been like for Steph? For Gemma and for Nikki and Mrs. Tyler. Why did it spare me? - Oh, I don't know. We can't always make sense of evil, Kim. This Salem curse, it's chosen innocent women to live, and it's chosen innocent women to die. And look, if there's one thing we do know about the world that is that us women, we always have a price to pay. But if we work together, and we work hard, and we focus, we have hope, Kim. - Hope for what? My best friend is dead. I just had to tie Billie up to stop her from hurting us or herself. (sighs) - This is all my fault. Look, I know I brought this book here, but I have to live with that. I want to live with that because every moment that I have here, that I am breathing, I am gonna be fighting. Fighting for me, fighting for you, fighting for Billie, fighting for Meadow. And we're gonna be fighting for Bridget. Are you with me? - I'm with you. - Found it. (shovel banging) - I thought you said Mrs. Tyler died here. (dramatic music) - [Ms. Dario] She did. (birds chirping) (suspenseful music) (mysterious chattering) (suspenseful music) - I call upon the guardians of the realm, the spirits of the earth. The curse of Bridget Bishop of Salem is to be undone. (lights buzzing) (dramatic music) - Keep going. - Her soul is to be bound by my blood to rest undisturbed for eternity. To release the evil back into hell. (dramatic whooshing) (groans) It burned. - You can do this. Concentrate. (hand knocking) Keep going. (hand knocking) - [Billie] Please, let me in. Please, I'm so scared. - We can't let her in. Keep going. - [Billie] Help me, please! Don't leave me. Kim? Kim, are you in there? - What if it's left her? Maybe she's okay. But it might come back. - Just finish this now. - To lift the curse hereafter, may the shadows cast on this earth no more. - Is that it? Finished? (dramatic music) - Keep reading. (Kim gasps) - Kim. Now. Now the darkness must... Kim? - Meadow. - Must choose a host to draw its final breath. (dramatic music) (Kim groans) (body thuds) (dramatic music) (Billie whimpers) - I can't stop. - Meadow stopped it. It's over. - [Woman] We demand the ground must taste her blood. (Billie whimpers) - They won't let me stop. They won't let me stop. (knife slices) (Kim chokes) (dramatic music) - This darkness is going to choose a final host and a final sacrifice. We've done all we can. We can be proud. (suspenseful music) - I'm ready to die. - [Woman] No, you are not. - It's not up to me, Billie. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) (footsteps thudding) (footsteps thudding) (floor creaking) - Hello? Ms. Dario? Mrs. Tyler! (door creaking) (footsteps tapping) (floor creaking) Ms. Dario. Are you all right? What's happened? Where are the girls? - I couldn't stop them. - Stop what? (body thuds) - They coached us all to succeed, but that's all it is, coaching. We don't learn anything. When you leave this school, do you believe the world will hand you what you want? I don't believe that. They can throw money at education all they want, but we'll still step out as women. Second class. They taught us how to act a bit, but not too much. You'll be nothing more than subservient, Meadow. (giggles) That's why I'm happy. I know I'm doing you a favor. What do you think you've learned, Meadow? - That I wasn't ready. That I should have paid more attention. - Wise. More attention. (chuckles) Then maybe you could have saved them. - My family will come for you. They've been looking for you for a long time. - I know. What fun. Goodbye, Meadow. - I'll see you in hell. (birds chirping) (man speaking indistinctly on phone) - Hey, Dad. Yeah, I'm great. But you don't need to do that. (man speaking indistinctly on phone) (suspenseful music) (man speaking indistinctly on phone) In sisterhood, there is power. And in me, there is sisterhood. There is eternity. There is always a price for women to pay. Billie says goodbye. (suspenseful music) (thrilling music)
