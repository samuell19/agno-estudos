Run! Run! Get the horses ready! We've got to get out of here! Gas attack! Gas attack! Leave the dead, get the horses ready! Get going! WESTERN FRONT - 1918 World War 1. I was 17 years old. Like tens of thousands of German Jews, I volunteered to serve my homeland, Germany. I am Siegmund Spiegel. My friends call me Menne. I was awarded the Iron Cross First Class for bravery in the defence of my country. Twenty-five years later my fatherland wanted to kill me. HOME FRONT 1943, MÜNSTERLAND I can tell... I can tell which egg is from which hen! Really! I can tell which hen belongs to which egg! - Then go ahead! - Now look... Menne! Menne Spiegel! You're still here. Only until tomorrow. They don't need us as slave labourers anymore. They're coming to get us. Like all the others. Nobody comes back from there. Someone who knows what he's talking about told me. Where can I go? It's too late for Switzerland... You know my farm. God alone can thank you. Mine or yours? I know your wife. But only Marga and the little girl. You have to disappear. Everyone knows you, the horse Jew. Marga. Marga. Wake up. We have to go. In the middle of the night? We can't wait until tomorrow. Hurry up. You can go to Aschoff's. You're so beautiful. You have to live. What kind of a life, among complete strangers... They're my war buddies! They know what you look like. It isn't right... We have to think of Karin. And the others, our relatives, Isidor? Evening dress in the countryside? I could meet an attractive farmer. I'll wear it for stable work. Without jewellery it's only a rag anyway. Just a small case to make it look as if you're being evacuated to the countryside. Your stupid Iron Cross! What will that be good for? It will protect us... Wear all you can. Menne, let's stay. Marga, don't be so naive. No one ever returns from where they take us. Everybody says that, even Aschoff. And why do you let your brother go there? He doesn't believe me! We can't wait to see who's right. Mama, Mama! I had a terrible dream! Now you'll dream something nice, together with your Mama. With your eyes open. What would you like to dream about? Want to go for a walk? - What's your name? - Karin Krone. - And your mother? - Like me, silly. - I know, but still. - Marga Krone. I know everything, Papa, you've explained it a thousand times. Papa, why aren't you coming with us? I have to chase the enemies of Germany. And how long will that take? We'll see. We forgot Cookie. He's too old and has hardly any fur left. Papa will buy you a new one. I have to go now. They're expecting me at headquarters. I'll always be near you. - What's your name? - Krone. Karin Krone. - And where are you from? - From Dortmund. - And where is Papa? - He's at war. Excuse me. Did I hear right? Has the little girl lost her mother? No, no. I'm the mother. But we are not we anymore. Sweetie, people don't change with a new flat, only the address does. We just moved. For professional reasons. My husband was an engineer before he volunteered. Just moved and already travelling again? I'm accompanying my daughter to a contest. What's the prize? They're choosing the girl who will sing for the Führer on his birthday! Oh, yes. In the name of the Holy Trinity, Virgin Mary, protect our sons and daughters. Let the farm and fields prosper, and keep the animals healthy. Be with our son Klemens on his way to Russia. Let him do good for Germany. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen. Yes, Mrs. Aschoff speaking. Yes, my husband has informed us. Stay where you are. There's a bench near the telephone. Do you see it? Just sit down there. - My daughter Anni will pick you up. - I have a meeting! You're going there! Of all the evacuees we have offered shelter, all we lack is Mrs. Krone! She has a little girl, too. - Hurry up! - Okay, I'm going! Papa has a soft heart. Yes, and I have a heart of stone. - Just like your father. - I like farmers and schnapps... and beautiful women too. Eat it up! There won't be cake for a while. You don't have a clue! We get parcels with cakes. But none like this one! Mrs. Krone? Yes, that's me. Marga Krone. - My daughter, Karin. - Karin Krone. Anni Aschoff. Hello. Where's your luggage? It will be sent. I prefer travelling with light luggage. Let's go. Your father promised my husband to offer shelter if something happens. - He must have a kind heart. - Do you know him? I never had the opportunity. Well, now is the time. I bet you had a great flat in Dortmund. Very beautiful. Three floors, garden, cook and a goldfish. A goldfish. No dog? No, only Isidor. Fish are more trusting. - I don't like dogs. - Shame. - There are cute dogs. I meant, too bad for your flat. It's not so fancy here. We're farmers and like dogs, all kinds. - Hello, ladies. - He means you... Hello. Hey, dumbo. Aren't you at the meeting? I'm on a special assignment. - Hey, kid. Want a sweet? - Karin? No, thank you. When she's ten she'll have to join too! In April we were at the Führer's birthplace. I'm in two of the pictures. One in front of the house where the Führer was born. The Führer, in such a small house! I had a German Girl's League meeting today, but instead... Bye. - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! Thank you. My brother. He's off to the Russian front. Here they are. Without luggage! Mrs. Aschoff? Thanks for your hospitality. Also in the name of my husband. Mine isn't even in sight yet. Karin, say hello. Shake hands with Mrs Aschoff... Karin! Spoilt, the little miss. A little, but mostly shy. She'll get over that quickly here. - Wonder where Father is. - That's all right. Wish him well. I'll walk down the road and hitch a lift. I'm counting on you rascals. I want a gun and a fur cap. And I want a polar bear hat. Of course! Bye, Klemens. Stay out of trouble. I wish you a pleasant stay, Mrs. Krone. How are you talking!? Did you hear that? Klemens! Okay, let's go... One comes, another one leaves. I'm sorry. We arrived at the most untimely moment. The poor boy. But he has to. This is your bed. Emmerich slept in it very well. Now he has outgrown it... Mrs. Spiegel, the cross must stay. Karin will get used to it. I haven't told my children. I'll be careful. This is the door outside. My husband was right. You don't look Jewish at all. Good. Hello, Laurentz! Here I am! I thought you weren't going to come! First comes Pentrop, then Silkenböhmer, no, first Silkenböhmer, then Pentrop... You mad? - Paula, a round. - Not for us, we have to go... Klemens, stay well! And don't forget to write your parents. If you have to write something important, put it under the glue strip. I will. Goodbye. Have a drink. Come on, your mother can't see you. - Cheers! - Cheers! I bet she didn't bat an eye when you left. A kiss. A kiss? A kiss, she gave me a kiss. A kiss. You lucky boy! Paula, this is my son, my own flesh and blood. Klemens Aschoff. Eastern Front Artillery. Here, Klemens Aschoff! Eastern Front Artillery! I come here, lie to Mama, and what do you do? What do I do? Papa, please, this is my last evening. Here: Gunner, Northwest, 12 degrees... bang! Cut it out. Just wanted to show you how it is to be a man. But I'm just a stupid farmer. And you're off to war. Be careful. The heroes and the volunteers are the first to fall. Klemens, you know you don't have to go. You have the Iron Cross. You were there too. Yes. That's why. That's why. Let's have another drink. We gave them our best room. I'm sure Papa never even got as far as their doormat! Three floors, garden, cook and a goldfish. Your father refused all invitations. Did he ever get one? Yes. Laurentz! Good old Laurentz. Go home. At least you have one. Go, go! Emmerich! Why aren't you at war? - I'm back already. - And my fur hat? Take Papa's hat. - You never saw Klemens, right? - Yes. Good. Come, Laurentz. - Papa! - Giddy up! Good night, Papa. Regards to your new guests. Farewell, son. Good night. Let's go, Laurentz. Of all times you had to pick Klemens' last evening to go to the bar. That's exactly why. You like to play the good Samaritan, but don't even see your own son off! You prefer saving Jews! Jews! Menne and his wife are Germans, Westphalians like you and me. When it's life or death, the creed is unimportant. Life or death, don't exaggerate! They were to be sent to the east. Nobody comes back from there. Even Pentrop's cousin says that, and he's a policeman. And if our Klemens doesn't come back? Time to go to bed, Mother. If the Führer knew about this... What are you gaping at? Back to work! Drink, please. To make it clear from the start, Mrs. Krone: Our prisoners of war aren't eating with us. They're listening to the farmers' radio, by order. So I have less explaining to do. Right, Witold? Seed potatoes! Yes, sir. The Reich's harvest! They're also evacuated, from Dortmund! We didn't hear anything. Was Dortmund bombed? - Yes. - And Reinoldi Church? We went to the station at once. - Who's that? - That's Mrs. Krone. - Do I know her? - She lives here now. So, so, little girl, eat up your food. Come on, eat! Cookie! Now eat! I knew you wouldn't leave me alone. See? Karin, you also wore this when you were in your Mama's belly. You looked so elegant. Yes, I know. And these, do you remember these? But Mama, I was in your belly! - Cookie... - Excuse me. I wanted to show you the farm. Silk? Yes, with real mother-of-pearl buttons. My great-grandfather laid this mosaic floor. These are our pigs. That's the duck pen, but they're out now. - When are they fed? - Twice a day. That's straw for mucking out, and this is our stallion, Laurentz. And here are our cows: Berta... ...and that's Runa, and that's Minka! And who lives up there? More evacuees. Anni, can you lend us the little one? He wants you to join them. But I don't know them. Everything is still so new. She'll adapt... One moment please. Join them and make friends. But I don't like them. You don't know them. You don't like them, but maybe Karin Krone does. Let her play. Two games in one. That should be fun. Go! Good girl! Not even a slap on her bum? We don't do that kind of thing. Listen, Reinoldi Church? City Hall? A Dortmunder should know. There was such chaos, I really can't tell. We have the Jews to thank for that! The last ones have just left. - The Reich is now clean of Jews. - Thank God! The potatoes need peeling. Come on. Take your positions! Target in sight! Reload! In your positions! Fire! Gunner! Fire! Fire! Fraidy-cat, scardey-pants! Fraidy-cat, scardey-pants! Look here: deadly throw! Stupid boy! Good day. - I'm Emil's friend. - Our brother is in Russia. - I didn't know that. - So you can't be his friend. We were on the Western Front in 1917/1918. - What's your name? - Spiegel. Menne Spiegel. And why aren't you at war? He's a Yid. With a name like that. Yes, I'm a Jew. From Ahlen. Come out of there. Come on! Emil said I could come to his farm if there was danger and stay for a while. We don't know anything about that! He'd never shelter a Jew. - I always got along well with Emil. - So did everyone else! Yesterday all the Jews from Ahlen were transported east. And why aren't you with them? Because Emil promised me... Listen here, Mr. Spiegel, we don't have a death wish. Stop! Reich Animal Protection Force. Rabies Control. Show me the immunization card. You gave me a fright. - Axel is in good shape. - Was a good buy. Menne? - Doesn't need much fodder, right? - Can't complain. Incredible! Menne! Out of the blue! But there aren't any Jews left. - Where have you been hiding? - In a convent. My bicycle! I'll pick it up tomorrow. - Hello, Pentrop. - Hello, Josefa. What are you looking at? I'm looking for someone. Have you seen a man? Medium tall, with a curl of hair here, and a measuring stick for horses. No, I haven't. Giddy up. - Is this my lunch or Pentrop's? - No. For the mother. Let me do that. Mother's cooked more than we can eat again! You shouldn't have! Ah, the heir! Come. He can already lift his head. What a hold! How strong you'll be! Mr. Pentrop, look at this. Great movie, "The Enemy Is Listening!" René Deltgen! Thanks, and don't forget to send my regards to your father. Of course. Come here. Shall we eat? It isn't a movie poster! It's about treason! Do you understand that, Anni? It's not just passing on important war information. Also listening to enemy radio and passing on the propaganda: all acts of treason. They want to break us. But they won't succeed. We must be alert! I am. For example, this Mrs Krone, who lives with us now. - Yes? - She's strange. Once she says this, then that. You never know with her. Strange, you say? Yes. Strange, and that's it. Take care of yourself! The Tommies won't destroy us. They already destroyed the Möhne Dam. Father, don't you understand? That was sabotage. - If they can blow up those walls... - They were built by foreign workers. So was the Führer's headquarters. You stupid git! Come on! Come on! - Come down here. - My leg's asleep. - Can you make it? - Yeah. "The enemy is listening". When you turn on the light, cover the window. I don't need any light. Menne, give me a hand. - It's only for a short time. - Yes. About a thousand years! Don't worry. I like to help, but times are tough. My wife is almost in the next world. She can hardly sit straight. She lost too much blood giving birth. The baby is big. Four kilos? Yes. And ten. Relax, I didn't move from my spot. Just a very careful look from under the tarp. Where's your family? They're safe. The others are all gone. Deported to the east. Here, if you have to pee. Have you completely lost your mind? Shhh, I want to listen. You always have to do forbidden things! And you? Hiding Jews? How are you feeling? I see. Boredom is terrible. Fresh bread. Sausage. Milk. Do you play chess? Chess? I can't play chess. Neither can I. SUMMER 1943 - Is that alright? - Nice. Do you know the rest? So much milk! I had no idea you were a singer. Just for the cows. They're deaf like me and their French is even worse than mine. Still, - I'd have loved to have been a singer. - Me too! What did you do earlier? I mean before... You mean as a young girl of your age? Yes. I feel old. Not as old as I felt when I studied physics. - At university? - Yes. But I had to stop. Why? - Mama, there's somebody out there! - Quiet! I'm scared! Turn on the light! There's nobody out there. Do you want to see us all in jail? Shot or rather hung? Everybody knows your Jew-face. We all bought your horses. I need to see Marga. There's nobody out there. - It was just a dream. - There it is again! - What's the matter, Marga? - Nothing. I just had a bad dream. What's that there? That was the bomb. It smashed the whole aquarium. Poor Isidor. Poor little girl. And the bomb crater in the garden. I also keep dreaming of the bomb. Then go to bed! Karin had a bad dream. I'm sorry. I... Then we can also go back to bed. Midnight... That's the ghost hour. Ghosts are punctual, even if it rains. Was it wearing a white sheet? No, not like in a fairy tale. Like in real life. Real ghosts look like us. How do you know it was a ghost? Because it could fly, stupid. Did it talk? Where shall we put them? This must have an end! There's a war on, Mrs. Aschoff. Then there must be an end to the war! I'll pass it on. On the night of Pentecost Monday. Oberhausen: 1000 houses a total loss, 500 half-destroyed... 12 June, Düsseldorf: 100,000 homeless. 13 June, Bochum... Mrs Aschoff, I have to house them. Four people. The numbers are mandatory. Nobody could live in that barn. Decent people. Bombed out. From Sterkerade. There must be mice! Are you out of your minds! What are you doing down there! Crawling around on the dirty floor? Get out! You too! I can't believe it! I haven't met you yet, young lady. I'm not a lady. I'm Karin. So, Karin. My name is Karin Krone. We live in Dortmund. My father is a soldier. And when he isn't a soldier? - Endgind... - Mr. Krone is an engineer. And you get out of here! I see. I note: 2 adults, 2 children from Sterkerade to Aschoff farm. Send the boy away! Back up! Back up! Further! You're worried about me, right? Not even a little bit? Just a tiny little bit? The true heroes are there! Just one leg left. - I'm only doing my duty. - With one leg? I can't allow that. - Karl! We've made it! - Mission accomplished? Mission accomplished! Accomplished! - No, don't ruin your hands. - Why? They're so beautiful. Really beautiful. You're beautiful too. What's happening at the enemy front? Mrs. Krone. Did you find out anything? Yeah, but there was nothing to find out. Don't look at me like that. I'm not the horse dealer's wife. And I'm no horse dealer. Right, then you'd have a different wife. What's he like? What do you mean? The horse dealer. He's short, isn't he? Then it must be love. Move over a little. CHRISTMAS 1943 No nibbling, Anni! How are the roast apples doing? Get going! Just a moment! Mrs. Wacker needs eggs. The eggs she goes through! How many do we have? - I'll check. - Twenty, I think. Stay, I'll do it. She can have eleven. - You can have eleven. - Make sure she pays on the spot! Eleven are perfect, thanks. You're welcome. Mrs. Spiegel?! That's Mrs. Krone. Here. We'll do the bill next time. Must have been a mix-up. Goodbye! We know you're an avid German Girls' League member. - And your father's a Party member. - Since 1930! They're good for Germany and the farmers! So what? All the same, we're Catholics, and so are you. Anyone say the opposite? We're closer to the Bishop of Münster than to Hitler. Papa! It's because of me. Your parents took me in because the Jew laws apply to Karin and me. I'm a Jew, my name is Spiegel. The landlady was right. She remembered me from Ahlen. They're our country's ruin, and you take them in! - They'd have been sent to a camp. - Others too! Do you know what happens there? - We can't be part of that! - You're liars and traitors! I'll teach you! And you're the worst! - Anni! - I hate you! We'll leave. At nightfall. I'd like to see that! Nobody's leaving! Neither by day nor by night. - And Mrs. Wacker? - Tut! Where are we going? It's a surprise. To Daddy, right? - Daddy's at war. You know that. - Then I want to stay here. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. I convinced the chicken. - How much? - Nothing. There are only six. And the eleven before. How much do I owe? I don't know. Ask my wife. - Mr. Aschoff, please! - Mr. Aschoff? My name is Hermann! Don't you want to remember? Don't you like me anymore? So it was her after all! God Almighty! I thank you! Let's sit down with a good beer! Yeah! Water for me. Water for me, too, please. I didn't know Mrs. Spiegel. But I knew Mr. Isidor for a long time. Back then I often helped them out. It was already forbidden then, but... When I opened the door for Menne Spiegel on that night of horror, I barely recognized him, because his face was so bloody. She also looked terrible. And then the child: Covered all over with shards. Over the whole body, over her whole chest. Even in her mouth. That's what scarred her. So the child's there too? You saw her playing with my children. The red-haired one. She held her with her broken arm while I pulled out the shards. It took over an hour. Not one complaint. Neither from the mother nor the child. The bastards carried on all night. Kicking in doors, swinging their clubs... They smashed everything. The chandelier, too. Poor Mr. Isidor. I thought he was dead. I was so ashamed of being a German. That can't happen here. That's what I thought back then, too. - That was courageous. - Far off. When they set the synagogue on fire I left in a hurry. - Aren't you afraid? - Should we be? Just like her mother. Yes, just like her mother. We can't risk our necks. If they were relatives... What a clan! If even scaredy-cat Pentrop can have a Jew in his house. His cousin is in the police. Yes. Brown as dog shit. Pentrop? That's where Erich is! What harm can that twerp do? He's a group leader! Where should they go? - Better not to know. - Mama, a chandelier on the child. Can you imagine that? We did what we could. Others would have said no. Yes. And Pentrop? He even has a dying wife. We wanted to say goodbye. Here, provisions. Thank you. Where are we going, Mama? Who's that? That's Mrs. Spiegel, Mother. - Do I know her? - She lives here. And so does her daughter. Mrs. Spiegel... I beg you from the bottom of my heart, please stay. Krone. Mrs Krone. That's safer. SPRING 1944 Pentrop is hiding somebody up there. Huh? Pentrop is hiding someone! He just brought him food. Feeding deserters! I'll take care of the two-faced bastard! Keep your nose out of this! What do you do all day? I think. I try to remember my best jokes. A bloke wants to sell a horse. He goes to the farmer, and says to the farmer: "Listen..." That was a good joke. A good joke. A good one. Just don't get weird from all that thinking. - And this one? - Underneath. You don't belong in the kitchen, you belong in the pub! Haven't been there since... Since the pub was snowed in? It was! But now the weather's nice, it's time again. Klemens! They'd send a telegram. Aschoff? It's Pentrop. Hubert? Yes, yes. We'll do that. I called Aschoff. There! Menne, come here. Look! What do you say? What would Papa say? My little foal! Strong bones. Hooves a little soft. You'll get to hug them! Withers at the right spot... Shit! Shove off! Shove off! To me he's beautiful. He's the most creative and funniest man I know! I'll take care of that. - Here for me? - I wanted to see the kid. And she the horse. No one came for me. I'm leaving anyway. Haven't you heard? Come on, little Nazi, shove off! I'll tell you even if you don't care. I'm joining the Wehrmacht or the Luftwaffe. War? - Total war. - Isn't it enough yet? Total war means a fast victory! Also for you farmers. You'll make more profit. - Aren't the Jews taking the profit? - They're gone! And where? - They split! - One-way ticket east? Abroad, where they can scheme against us. What planet are you from? Germany. Westphalia. Traitor! What did I tell you? Sorry, I couldn't keep them back. Adults first, then the children! I don't want to stink of flowers! - I do! - So do I! Come on, kids, get out. Straight away! Where are you going? Stay. Come over here! Really? You have a good figure, I have to grant you that. Oh, it's wonderful. With violets. Take a break, Anni, stop. Have some water. You're all sweaty. I'm not thirsty! Come back... come back... A little air. You're beet red. I'll lose my concentration... - Marga! - What? - Just wait until Erich sees you like that. - Erich? Why? Didn't you invite him? Why should I? - He's a Nazi! Don't you understand? - He just pretends. Nonsense. He's a group leader and wants to join the forces. A bit confused, the boy. His blond head needs tidying up. He isn't blond, you are! Still he hates you! - A youthful error. - He hates all Jews! Jews? Are there any left? I don't see any. I guess they all went away. But their clothes... They left their clothes behind. This is for you. A gift. Dear friends... Not even on my birthday? Friends, I'd like us to drink... Come back. I am waiting for you. You are all my happiness. Come back... ...my heart keeps calling... ...and fulfil my destiny. Even if the road is far... ...it will carry you and me to bliss. Therefore I beg you, come back! And then they say the League trains girls only for military purposes. No! Song and dance are important, too! Thanks, daughter, for this act! I hope you'll enjoy yourselves tonight. To our far-away sons, may they return soon! Congratulations. Do you remember 1918? With Menne? Great. Marga, Marga. Anni loved those gloves. I didn't waste a thought on the star. Menne always called it 'silly thing'. That was stupid of me. I should have thrown it away. But I couldn't bring myself to part with the star. It can cost us all our lives. What are they saying? The SS attacked the Warsaw Ghetto. The Jews defended themselves: they didn't want to be deported to a camp. They fought with guns and hand grenades. The Germans attacked with aircraft, artillery and tanks. The Jews fought back for three weeks. Then their houses were burned down. Whoever hides escaped Jews will be shot on the spot. ...and declare under oath that no unregistered person is present on my farm. My brother, Josef Pentrop, from Münster in Westphalia, has left today. I know a Pentrop. Went to Police Academy with me. Always in good spirits. That's Rainer, my cousin. He's in Munich now. Mr. Pentrop, your farm is big. A lot of people here. You can't have an eye on everyone. How many are you housing, besides Mr. Reimann? Him and his father. They're officially registered. Here I recommend that we insert: "as far as I know". Spell it out. ...and declare that. as far as I know, no unregistered person is present on my farm. - Nervous, Mr. Pentrop? - Only cold. Make sure the signature is legible. Good night. - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! The horse dealer! The Jew! Yes, it's him. - Hubert, I... - Wait, wait. This is Menne. I've been hiding him in our attic for over a year. You need a strong heart to be a hero. I'm sorry for putting you in this situation. Erich... That's what the police meant. - They'll come back. - They'll search the whole house. Hubert! I'm leaving. They won't search my deathbed. Go and get the boy! Erich! I'm here. - Come here! - Hand me the ropes! - Here, here! - Aschoff! Grab it by the tail! Get the knife! Slaughtering is verboten! That's right! Come here with the knife! You can go to jail for this! Menne, we've already passed Brinkhof's farm. He's exaggerating! It's behind the corner. I can't believe it. Those police idiots! Should have made short shrift of those farmers. The hypocrites! What are you doing so early? Getting out of here. I don't want to listen to your crap. Poor man. In the midst of all the sausages. - I'll go for some water. - Never forget to lock up! In case of danger, I'll call: "Where's the key?" Or you call: "Where's the key, Heinrich?" Then you go out of the window in a flash! Okay? "Where's the key, Grete?" "Where's the key, Grete?" I won't make any noise. During the night the enemy started his long-awaited attack on Western Europe. Soon after the beginning it became clear that the British and the Americans are concentrating their attacks on the regions of Caen, Carentan and Cherbourg. The fighting must continue! You must not act, you must obey! You must submit yourselves! You must comply with these constraints! AUTUMN 1944 Sieg Heil! "Dear Father, Mother, Anni, Emmerich, Florian, Grandma. Sorry for not writing often lately, but I lack the words to describe what's going on. I am so tired. Only my comrade Siegfried is left. When it's calm, we can hear the Russians reinforcing their positions. One more thing: I'd like my lighter. Fire is hard to come by around here. Matches are no good, you use them up too quickly. And regards to our guests from me! All the best and see you again soon. Your son, Klemens." - He can have mine. - That's mine! He's always so confident, the boy! What's the matter? It's because of her father. If Papa doesn't write, it means he can't do so. - But we can write to him. - We don't know his address! Send the letter to Klemens. He'll make sure your father gets it. Look. Forces' Mail number 3467. Okay, come get me. Here I am! Come! I'm here! I'm here! Come! Come! Let them come! I'm here. I wish them success! Let it burn! Marga! But you're German, too. I only meant the Nazis. Anni, I'd like to go to Münster. I want to see it with my own eyes! But there's only rubble. That's why! Even the bricks burn, Marga. To think that bricks can burn! Like our synagogue. An eye for an eye. Will you claim that a mother and her child moved to Münster during the bombing? Yes. To no. 1 Schillerstrasse. - Hello. - Documents? - Burned. No registration? You must have my registration. Krone, Margarethe and Karin Krone, from Stolberg. Mrs. Krone, we don't have papers anymore. But why are you moving from Stolberg to bombed-out Münster, of all places? Because our only friends are here! That's true! And where in Münster? No. 1 Schillerstrasse. But that's a commercial building. We're only there temporarily, in a back room. Anni's family arranged it. So you aren't registered? You just said... I don't know. I've been confused since the raid. Now I want to straighten things out. But you do know your husband's Forces' Mail number? Yes! 3467. 3-4-6-7. - There. Heil Hitler! - Thank you. Heil Hitler! There! Margarethe Krone from Münster. Karin Krone, Margarethe Krone. Completely legal! Anni, I can't believe it! This is like an ID card. I can apply for food stamps and family benefit! Klemens is dead. The doctor gave her an injection. Oh, God. My God. Isn't that what you wanted? Revenge! Now you've got it! Shove off! You didn't even say goodbye to him, didn't want to see your son one last time. Klemens... Klemens! God, I hid the wrong ones! Mama, the farmer didn't tell the truth. He and the soldier... He who? What soldier? The dead one... you don't understand. He and the soldier were in a smoky place. They smelled and couldn't walk. Then came Laurentz. And turned off the light. Good night, my darling. Not today either. Listen. Your father was with Klemens before he left. He would have never let him go without saying goodbye. They were at the pub, carousing. My brother doesn't drink. On the last evening among men anything goes. What are you doing? Are you talking to Laurentz? If the horse could only talk. He was with you and Klemens. How did he feel? He wanted to go to war. I tried... I wanted to hide him. I only want to know if he was happy. Did he laugh? He was so wonderful when he laughed. He was so happy and content. He talked about you. He told me you gave him a kiss. He told me twice. I'm cold. Come. Go ahead, smoke. Better than smoked sausages. Aschoff's Klemens has fallen. Long night. Sure, the dark has made you humble. There's light in the darkness. Johannes fallen in Norway! You've told him a thousand times. Thaddeus missing in Africa! "A people without space". Menne hasn't seen this photo yet. Moritz, Russia! No sign of life from Moritz in two months! - You'd be surprised at what we can do! - You can't... Yes, we can! Provisions for 100 men. Impossible! Not enough pots, dishes... - Don't interfere with us! - Where does that lead to? The pantry. You can't house people there. Where's the key, Grete? Pork slaughtering! Confiscated! Out of here! Werewolf radio, the German resistance station in the territories occupied by the Allies! Allied command has imposed a curfew... - The Americans are here! - Already in command! Nay! The Americans are here! Look who's here. It's over, Mrs. Krone! Anni, come inside! Everyone inside! German men and women! Soldiers of the German Wehrmacht! Our Führer Adolf Hitler has fallen. Did you hear? It isn't over yet. - The end is near. - It's not over yet! Into the cellar! Don't do that! It's not her fault! One more, Papa, help me forget him! - I knew it, she loves that prat! - But I mustn't! We live for our people! Traitors... Down with the flag! Go on take it down! Move, you traitor! Come on! Come on! Come on, you traitor! Down with the flag! Go on! In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Mother Mary, thou art blessed among women. And blessed is your offspring. Pray for us, Mother of God, in our darkest hour... - That's the sisters' farm! - Was! It's not the Americans, but the forced labourers. Going from farm to farm, setting them on fire. Children! Children! - Mama, our star! - Yes! Can I now be Karin Spiegel again? Mrs. Krone. The Americans want to seize the farm. My dear, I beg you, save us! Menne! Papa! How could you lead me on like that! Where's your uniform? Where's your iron Kaiser Cross? You're wounded! The war's over, Papa's coming home! What did you bring me? You promised me a bicycle. With a seat on the back for Cookie. Why don't you say anything? You're so strange, Papa. I don't want Papa to be like this. Menne. I can't stand the noise. Forgive me. I'll speak very softly. What did he say? They think Menne is a Nazi, SS! He is my husband! He's my husband! Dear Anni, it took years for us to learn everything, and even more years until we knew that we would never be free of the solitude of our knowledge. But one thing became clear to us: that our farmer heroes had done something that obviously was possible in Nazi Germany; and that by rescuing us, our farmers also had saved the entire world; and that we will forever honour and love them for that. Forever yours, Marga. OF THE 98 JEWS FROM THE CITY OF AHLEN, ONLY THREE WERE SAVED. 455 GERMANS OF THE 70 MILLION CITIZENS OF THE REICH WERE OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED AND HONOURED AS "RIGHTEOUS OF THE NATIONS" FOR SAVING JEWS. - That was it. - That was it. Okay. Maybe that's how it was. Yes. - Thank you Anni, thank you Marga! - You're welcome. All the best for the future. And good work. We are happy to have been here with you! When does the scene with the Americans come? - We've already shot it! - Oh, you have! It's all done now, isn't it? Subtitling by SUBS Hamburg, Ingar Alan Milnes, Georg-Felix Harsch
