MagnaVolt. The final word in auto security. No embarrassing alarm noise, no need to trouble the police... and it won't even run down your battery. On the international scene, the Amazon nuclear power facility... has blown its stack... irradiating the world's largest rain forest. Environmentalists call it a disaster. But, don't they always? In national news, Attorney General Marcos today... approved the ED-209 combat unit... for deployment in five American cities... despite widespread complaints of malfunction. The surgeon general is dead. Gunned down, twenty minutes ago, by a militant addict... of the deadly designer drug "Nuke." The greatest health threat facing our nation. Nuke. The most addictive narcotic in history. A plague that... Nuke! Nuke! This station has just received this transmission from Cain... convicted murderer and leader of the Nuke cult. The people want paradise. And they will have it. The assassination is the latest act of terrorism by Cain... following the fire bombing of a drug treatment clinic... that left five dead, last week. Following the latest breakdown in negotiations... Detroit's police today returned to the picket line... demanding better terms from Omni Consumer Products, OCP... the corporation contracted by the city... to run the Detroit police department. OCP cut our salaries 40 percent and canceled our pensions. And now they refuse to even talk to us. God knows why, but they want this strike. What happened? Get up! Hold him! You put my eye out, you bitches! Shut up, you fuckhead! You're breaking my fucking arm! Hurry! Look at this. What a nasty man. Night's made. Let's pay Papa and get us what we need. Nuke me, baby! I'll kill you bitches! He's up! Come on! You're shit with a timer, man! Come on! Let's go! I'll take out an army with this shit! Let's load up and get the hell out of here! Where's the bullets for this gun, man? Third drawer, bottom. We should've brought a truck! I really like this gun, man. Just take it and get out. Thanks. I don't believe this! What? It's the cops, man. Cops are on strike, stupid. Can't you hear that? See, what did I tell you? I'll fix him. Did you see that? We got him! Beautiful. Come on, man, let's move it. No. One more! Nice shit, man. Fucking cops! Peace officer. Think it over, creep. Nuke. It's not mine, man. Where is it made? It's not mine, man. I told you! I'm clean! Where is it made? I don't know, man! All I know is where I get it! Freeze. Nobody move. This is a bust. Ladies, stay down. Somebody! Open the fridge, damn it! Come on! Can't shoot a kid, can you, fucker? Can't shoot a kid... Throw it home, Dad! Shut up! Drop it or the little shit's dead! I'll blow its fucking head off, man! Lewis... hang it up. Now, no shit from either one of you! And don't try to follow me! We won't. The baby's going with me! No. I'll kill it, man. I'll do it, I'll fucking kill it! We can't have that. Nice shooting. See you, Jimmy. Hi, Mom. Hi. Don't do it! No! Stop... stop it, Alex! OCP defines you as a machine... that utilizes some living tissue. You understand that. Yes. And so, do you consider yourself human? I require an answer. Stop tape. You have any idea what you're doing to that poor woman? Take a look at her file. Go on. Officer, Mrs. Murphy is bringing suit against OCP. My name is Tom Delaney. I'm representing her. Up to a few months ago, she wouldn't leave her bedroom. Then there were hypnotists and harmonic treatments. Then you pull this shit! Driving past her house, day after day. Spying on her. Trying to make her think her husband is still alive. She's barely started to accept the loss. You're ripping her to pieces. And for what? Do you think you could ever be a husband to her? I mean, what can you offer her? Companionship? Love? A man's love? No. Roll tape. Are you Alex Murphy? No. Are you human? No. You are simply a machine. I am... a machine. Nothing more. Nothing more. That'll do it. Stop tape. Now, you stay there. All right, go get her. Let's be decent about this. Give them some privacy. I don't have a problem with that. Alex? Don't you know me? Don't you remember me? Alex, it doesn't matter what they've done to you... Touch me. It's cold. They made this... to honor him. No, I... Your husband is dead. I don't know you. Why is this happening? I thought all communication systems were the same. I tried to save the company a few bucks. It took two days to download specs from Cleveland. I lost the account. It hardly befits my dignity to have to come to you, Johnson. Sorry for the slight inconvenience, Your Honor. Twenty minutes in rush hour isn't slight. Not when you're mayor of a major city! When will you start paying the cops so they'll go back to work? We're not a charity. The city owes us over $37 million. You'll have to cut us some slack. A deadline's a deadline. Sorry. How are we supposed to raise that kind of money? You aren't. What the hell is he talking about? We don't expect you to pay. Let me refer you to our contract. "In the event of default... OCP shall have the uncontested right of foreclosure on all city assets." You signed this. We miss one payment, and you can foreclose? We can and we will. We're taking Detroit private. So you deliberately undermined our credit. That was the easy part. And you engineered the police strike. You want Detroit to tear itself apart... so you can raid it like you would any other corporation! Do you know how many people are dying? You're murderers! I'd advise you to say nothing further. It might be... actionable. It's bullshit! Bullshit, you senile, old bastard! All right, calm down. We better get out of here. I'm okay! Calm down. We better leave. I'm calm. Calm down. Easy. I'm okay. All right, good. I'm in control. Relax. Everything is fine. It's okay. I'm fine. One last thing, gentlemen. We will sue your asses. Give it your best shot. Fuck you, you old, senile bastard! This is bullshit! Fuck you! This is bullshit! Calm down. I've been very patient, Johnson. Five months. Who's that? That's Dr. Juliette Faxx. She's just moved up, to head the Attitude Adjustment team. Five months. Ninety million dollars! I want to see some results. Yes, sir. I'll show you what we have. OCP pioneered cyborg technology. And now we take a quantum leap forward. State-of-the-art destructive capabilities... commanded by a unique combination of software and organic systems. In every way, an improvement over the original. It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you, Robocop 2. You are under arrest. Stop, or I'll shoot. Stop, or I'll shoot... OCP is proud to present the future of urban pacification: Robocop 2. Ninety million. They all go crazy. Robots with emotional problems. No sir, no sir, not robots, cyborgs. Cybernetic organisms. We use living human tissue and that's our whole problem, sir. The candidates were all fine men, respected police officers. I reviewed their files, myself. Sir, police officers may not be the best candidates... for our purposes. They're a physical bunch. They're macho, body-proud. Finding themselves stripped of all that... there's no wonder they become suicidal. Our one success was a cop. Well, yes, Mr. Johnson. Alex Murphy. Top of his class, devout Irish Catholic, family man. Everything in his profile indicates a fierce sense of duty. That's probably what kept him alive. With due respect, Dr. Faxx, your area of expertise is psychology. Not robotics. There's no harm in hearing the young lady out, is there? No, sir. Thank you, sir. I believe that Murphy's case was unusual, but not unique. We can find someone else. Someone to whom the prospect might even be... desirable. Sir, I've never met anyone who wanted to be a robot. Well, it would require a screening process... one I'd be happy to supervise. The cost would be negligible. And, uh... it'd be a shame to waste all the work that's been done, wouldn't it? It certainly would, my dear. Go to it. Report to me, directly. Yes, sir. You could learn a thing or two from that girl, Johnson. ...not for me! Decent pay to decent cops! Union's got a list! We ain't forgetting who you are! One at a time! Please, one at a time. Don't you know what's going on out here? It's the best we can do! Hello, ladies! They won't be fucking with any more cops! They won't be fucking with nobody, man! Hob. That's him. Thank you. Nuke me! Go ahead. Take two. There's plenty of Nuke to go around. I've lost him. You haven't been around in a while. Go ahead. This one's on me. Five degrees south-southwest. There's the little darling. Good eyes, Murphy. Good as money can buy. Ferdy, you got out. Well, I'll tell Cain, okay? Better have something to give me this time, officer. One cop per car. Okay, these are the routes. Three cars. One cop per car? That's right. Sitting ducks. We set up three snipers and that's all it takes. Pay the man. All right. Thank you. You didn't count it. That's all right. You should really count it, you know. It's okay. Give him something to help him with his conscience. No, that's all right. I don't really want it. Come on, Duffy. I know you need it. Isn't this a school day? Cops! Oh, shit! Oh, no. Freeze! Turn around. Put your hands up. Shit. Officer Duffy, have a seat. You look a little out of breath, bitch. You sold us out, Officer Duffy. What are you talking about, Murph? Where is Cain? I don't know any Cain. Where is Cain? I don't know. Where is Cain? I told you, I don't know! Where? River Rouge. The old sludge plant. You're a rotten cop. Go. You. You want me? Dead or alive. Then one of us must die. Dead, then. Jesus... had days like this. Hounded and attacked like a criminal. But like him, I don't blame you. They program you, and you do it. I will kill you. Oh, you just tried. And... I forgive you. Why'd you stop? You got it cracked. I'm tired. They say he's got a brain. I want to see it. You think it was me that beat you? It wasn't. It was this. It's too tough. Try here at the joint. Yeah! Look at that! Come on. Cut it out. How's it taste? What the hell's going on? Man, just look at him. Christ, he's been stripped. Let's not get carried away, here. We're talking about a piece of equipment. Don't tell me he can't suffer. Just look at him. It's electrical. Bullshit. I know every inch of him. Every circuit. Every living nerve. His pain centers are alive. They're lit up like Christmas trees. Nah, the back-up generator's just making him twitch. He's suffering. How long can he last? No way of knowing. Got him on minimal life support. Keeping the brain going with microshocks. It's damn tricky. He could go anytime. Move. Move! What's happening in here? OCP is happening. These bastards won't lift a finger to help him. This unit needs millions of dollars in parts. You can't expect authorization for that kind of cash overnight. Be reasonable. If you don't fix him, it's murder. Now, settle down, honey. I'm doing you people a favor just by talking to you. You son of a bitch. He's in hell. Fix him! We'll be in touch. Oh, man, you guys are the greatest! Did you see their faces? "We're gonna throw away the key, Duffy." The cops didn't give you trouble, did they? The usual shit from Reed. They'll never prove anything. Hey, want some? Hey, I'm a minor. Don't want to break any laws. Here, you take it. God, I just love you guys! What happened? Hey, where we going? Hey, come on, guys. This isn't funny, man. Oh, God, my head. My head is killing me. Hey, man. What's... Hey, Cain! Hey, it's good to see you. Thanks for getting me out. I can't get up. You noticed that one. Cain, I don't know what the kid told you... You told them, Duffy. You told them where we were. No, that's not true! We know all about it, Duffy. You think you're the only cop we have? Oh, shit! Cain. Cain, come on. Man, I'm begging you, man! Look, I'll do anything! Okay. You're kidding, right? Yeah, you're just kidding. You scared me. You taught me a lesson, man. I'd never fuck with you, because I really love you guys. I really do! Shut up! I've been loyal. I know shit that I still haven't even told you, Cain! You deserve this, Duffy. Cain might have been killed. Okay. Okay. Maybe you ought to have the kid leave? Why? What? What do you mean, "have the kid leave"? That's a good touch. That's a good touch. "Have the kid leave." That's good. "Have the kid leave." Why? Come on. It's... it's over. Come on, Cain! Come on, man. What are you doing? Come on! You said you were just gonna scare him! Doesn't he look scared? I can't believe you'd do this. It hardly matters what you believe, Mr. Schenk. But these are criminals. They're maniacs. You're giving premature value judgments. All right, it may be true. The subjects are socially misaligned. Socially misaligned? These are death row inmates! And of no use to society. Schenk, we need a subject who'll welcome the power... the virtual immortality we offer. Now, I really think this is a good place to start looking. You're out of your mind. Is that your professional opinion? Yes, goddamn it, it is! Yes! And you are not using my lab... to put that kind of a brain into my cyborg! We'd dearly miss you, here. You're the one that's gonna be out of a job. I'm going to take this directly to Johnson. He's just been waiting for an excuse to get you fired. Good morning, sir. I'm sorry to bother you this early. You seem agitated. Frankly, I'm shocked. Mr. Schenk just called. It seems Dr. Faxx has begun screening candidates... for the Robocop 2... project. So I understand. It's very exciting. She's screening psychotics, sir. Murderers. Oh, we aren't planning to build a toy, Johnson. Faxx knows what she's doing. She's keeping Robocop offline. It's a public-relations disaster. You've got to learn to look at the larger picture. The foreclosure. You must know how important that is to us. With Robocop out of commission, the chaos down there will increase... and the odds that the city will fall into our hands. Yes sir, but... a competent executive would find a way... to deal with the corporate image problem. Couldn't agree with you more, Mr. Johnson. Fortunately, I have found a way. Yes, Ms. Faxx and I have already discussed it. I know you'll help to implement her ideas. Of course, sir. Whatever I can do. Anything else? Coffee? No, thank you. Don't forget your shoes on the way out. He's my patient, he's critical. I've gotta stay with him. We'll let you know when we need your services. Nobody on your staff has my experience with him. You need me. We don't need anybody. "We." Who the hell are "we"? You're a goddamn lawyer. You don't know anything about him! You're exactly this far from getting fired, babe. Shyster! He's one of mine. I want him back on his feet. Maybe he will be, or maybe we'll just sell the parts for scrap. That's up to us. You see, Robocop's off warranty. Robocop's command program... his set of directives... It determines his behavior. It's time to update the program... and I would like to hear from each one of you. It's about time they asked us. We're getting a lot of heat from parents' groups. Personally, I don't blame them. I'm a parent myself. All that destructive behavior. He's become a role model for our children. Now, what are we teaching them? You have a point. If he talked things out with people instead of firing that gun. Couldn't he take a little time to address environmental issues? What was that? He could speak out on environmental issues. Don't see any reason why not. For all the shooting he does... I've never once seen him take the time to do anything nice... like visit an orphanage. You're absolutely right. Or help a cat out of a tree... or go door to door collecting for the Red Cross... or maybe even roasting some marshmallows with some Cub Scouts. Why, Mr. Johnson, that is wonderful. Thank you so much. It's no good. Program isn't uploading. He's resisting. There's too much data! No, it's him. Leave him to me, Schenk. I can't... it's not going to work! You're wasting valuable time. Don't resist us. Let me up. I must go. Go where? Do what? Go dancing? Fall in love? What is it you think you are? Alex Murphy. That's a delusion. It's a glitch in your system. Alex Murphy is dead. You take away the plastic, and metal, and wires... and you're just a couple chunks on a coroner's table. You're not even a corpse. What are you? Respond. I am officer Alex Murphy... Detroit Police Department. That won't do. What are you? Robocop. Crime Prevention Unit. OCP. Better. Much better. I type it. You think it. You type it. I think it. What a wonderful opportunity you represent. Psychotherapy, it's such a... It's a slow, clumsy practice. But with you this is so simple. Direct. You're lucky. We can do in moments with you... what would take years with a human patient. I'm really very lucky. You're free. You're free from doubt. Free from having to make painful choices. I am free. He's ready. Uploading command program. I am so glad we had this chance to dialogue. Look at you. It's like you're brand-new. Thank you. Thank you. You really had us worried there, Murphy. I'm touched. Get this guy. He's touched. That's enough! All of you, back to your posts. Come on. Let's go. How you feeling, Murphy? I'm just fine, Warren. Thank you for asking. Let's get you downstairs. I want to see what those amateurs at OCP screwed up. Pity. It's a beautiful morning. Shame to waste it. Ready for duty, partner? You betcha. Let's go. Nothing I'd rather do. He sounds terrific. Something's wrong. Harder! It's Robo! Everybody out the back door! It's locked! It won't open! Murph, wake up, will you? Good morning. Come on, take him out. I think we should talk. What's with you, Murph? Where'd they go? "Where'd they go?" They're still here, the little bastards! Hands up! Let's go! Everybody up! Move it. Up against the wall. Let's go. Hands on top of your heads. Nobody move. You are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you... in a court of law. He's dead, Murphy. You have the right... You're reading Miranda to a corpse! I'm having... trouble. Oh, my. This isn't very nice. Though you may think you're having fun now... you only hurt the ones you love. Think of Mom and Dad. What kind of lesson are you teaching them? And now, a word on nutrition. Shit! He's fucked up! Bad language makes for bad feelings. Let's go! The point is... we all have to work. I haven't finished. Hit the gas, Murphy. The posted limit is 35. We should set an example, Anne. Your hair looks lovely that way. It's OCP. They did something to you. I'm fine. Isn't the moon wonderful tonight? It's still daytime. It's the thought that counts. Oh, Jesus. We're heading back to the station. That's all there is to it. What the hell are you doing? Waste makes haste... for time is fleeting. A rolling stone, is worth two in the bush. Go fuck a refrigerator, pecker neck! Bad language makes for bad feelings. You're nuts! Murphy, come on, let's go. Come on! Back! Thank you, for not smoking.
