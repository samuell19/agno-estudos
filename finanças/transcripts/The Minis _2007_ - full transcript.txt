(waves crashing) (film reel clicking) (birds chirping) - Look at this, look at this, honey. Grab the camera. Our little Roger's playing basketball. You know what I think? He grows up, he's gonna be a champion. Roger, do you know what my father used to say? If you believe in yourself, nothing is impossible. Hey, Roger, do you believe in yourself?

Hi Levy. - My name is Chevy. - Are you sure? - Anything interesting in the mail? - Yeah, I just got a letter from my mom from Paris. Did I ever tell you I'm from Paris? Not from Paris, France. From Paris, Texas. - I thought I picked up a hint of a French accent. (laughing) - It's not a French accent, it's a Texan accent, Benny. - Chevy, like the truck. - Mercy, would you look at what's coming to greet me. Tyrone, we're gonna be late for the basketball game. - I play basketball, too. - I'm sure you do. But he plays real basketball. Bye bye. (steady instrumental music) - You got it buddy, come on.

Yeah yeah, good job, buddy. - Susan, Roger, how are you? - Hey Linda, good to see you. - Oh it's great to see you getting involved with your son. - Oh, we love to support Chris in anything he does. - Good job, Chris, good job. - Well I hope you'll be coming down for out fundraiser on Saturday. We're gonna need as many parents as we can get to volunteer. - Shoot, Chris. Shoot, you got it. - Basketball great Dennis Rodman's going to be here. - Really? - The Worm? - [Linda] Yes. - Nice job, Chris, go. Come on, Chris, go go.

Chris. - Can you knock before you come in my room? - I thought I'd see about us going to see Dennis Rodman on Saturday. Your principal told me about it. - No thanks, I've got better things to do. - I just thought you'd enjoy seeing an NBA legend, because you love basketball so much. You're gonna show 'em in college, Chris. - I didn't get the basketball scholarship. - [Roger] What, you didn't get it? - No, look. What are your plans for me now, Roger? You can't even afford to send me to college. I'm stuck here. (door slamming) (gentle piano music) - What's wrong, honey? Talk to me. - I don't know what to do about Chris. I don't know what to say. - He's a teenager. Remember what we were like at that age? You know he loves you. - He calls me Roger. He doesn't even call me dad. (upbeat dance music) (intense rock music) (light electronic music) Chevy. Am I good father? - Of course you are. Why do you ask that? - I don't know. (phone ringing) Chris didn't get the scholarship. - That's too bad, Rog. (paper rustling) - He doesn't look up to me. - Dude, you have to be on a ladder for him to do that. - I think I'm an embarrassment to him. (steady instrumental music) - Rog, do you think I'm attractive? - Chevy, I've been wanting to tell you, I've been in love with you since kindergarten. - Stop it, I'm serious. Tall girls call me cute and baby doll. I don't think they really like me. But if I have that operation, I could be taller. - No, not that again. - But I'll be able to play basketball better, and she has a thing for basketball players. - Who's she? - She's so beautiful and she's tall. - Why do you only date tall women? - Because there are more tall ones than little ones. - Yeah, but it never works out for you. I mean, what's wrong with dating a dwarf? - 50,000 dollars? That's a lot of money. - That could be my son's tuition. - What are you talking about? - You wanted a chance to prove yourself. Well here it is. - What are you talking about? - All we need is three more players. - And where are we gonna find three tall guys to play with us? - We're not. - What do you mean? You're not seriously thinking. Whoa. (spitting) (upbeat hip hop music) - You can't be serious. - I thought you wanted to take a stand. - We don't stand a chance. (metal creaking) - I think you guys are scared. - Yeah, of getting stomped like bugs. Those guys in Venice play real basketball, man. - Real basketball? And what do we play, video games? Who says we can't take them? - I don't know what to say. - My dad always told me to believe. If we believe in ourselves, nothing's impossible. - Let's play for fun, like in the old days. - You know, you realize the last time we played, Charles Barkley had hair? (laughing) - Come on. Together we can do anything. At least let's give it a shot. - Why not? I got nothing else to do. - Okay, I'm in. - Alright, yeah. (upbeat music) Oh.

We can't do this on our own. - We need help. - And if we really wanna play, we need a fifth player. - We need to stand up and believe in ourselves. - What we need is a giant. Someone who knows how to play. - Why don't you just call the NBA? Hello, NBA? Yeah, this is Roger. Can you send us a fifth player? (laughing) (upbeat hip hop music) - Hm, what about a giant who used to be in the NBA? - Who? - You can't be serious. - And how are we gonna get him? - Money. If you ain't got money, you got nothing.

Well, it's been a pleasure. - Now's our chance, let's go. (upbeat hip hop music) - D. D. Rod. D. Rod. Yo, D, yo. - Mr. Rodman. Mr. Rodman, could we talk to you for a second? - Not now. - We just need a minute. - Yeah, we're fans, man. - Big ones? - Yeah, like you said in there, we're trying to follow our dream. - And what would that be? - We're gonna form a basketball team. - What? Are you serious? - Yes, we're training every day at the park down the street. - Yeah, we wanna play in the Venice Beach basketball tournament. It starts in eight weeks. - You can help us win by playing with us. - Or you could be our coach. - Am I being Punk'd right now? Look, time is money. I don't have the time, and you guys don't look like you have the money. So you know what, bye. - Can you at least think about it, Mr. Rodman? - Hey, at least we tried. (gentle music) I'll see y'all later. - Where are you going? - Yeah, I'd stay, but I gotta head home. I got real work to do. - We're still gonna do the tournament, right? I'll see you at practice tomorrow. Who needs Rodman, anyway? (upbeat hip hop music) - Chevy? Why the long face? Something wrong? - What are you, my shrink? - Hey, you don't have to bite my head off. I was just trying to help. - Sorry, Lorraine. I didn't mean to take it out on you. I'm just a little depressed. - Could've fooled me. Come on, what's the matter? Talk to Dr. Lorraine. - I wanna be a basketball player. - Are you gonna stop being funny and tell me what the problem is? - I wanna play basketball with Roger, and my old friend Nick, and George. I wanna compete in the Venice Beach basketball tournament. - That's great. If that's what you wanna do, then go for it. I'm behind you all the way. - But there's a little problem. Look at us. - Yeah? - We're dwarves. - No. Come on. I've known you for years. And what we are has never stopped you before. Look at me. This is the hottest diner in Venice Beach. Do you know how many tall, boob-alicious blondes tried out for this job? And guess who got it. Me, with my fabulous personality. - [Customer] Hey, what about my fries? - What about 'em? - But this is different. - How? - Because this is impossible. - So, what do you want? - I want people to respect me, I want people to like me for who I am, and I wanna win the basketball tournament. And I want, and I want a steady girlfriend. - No. What do you wanna eat? - Oh, the usual. - Coming right up. (upbeat rock music) - I don't know what you can do anymore. You've done it all. You showed up in a wedding dress at Rockefeller Center. You go-go danced in a cage. You dyed your hair every possible color. You did way too many reality shows. You think you can change your image by making public appearances at high schools? Who are you trying to fool? - What are you saying? - You're a freak. I made you a freak. And you know why? For the money. You make money, I make money. But now there's no money anymore. We need to find a gimmick. - Funny, yesterday a bunch of dwarves came and asked me to play basketball. Something, some tournament, something like that. You know, they're talking about following their dreams. They even asked me to coach 'em. - We have sunk to a new low. Wait a minute. Hold it right there. Do you see the possibilities, the publicity? This could be a goldmine. It's never been done before. You know what we can do with this? Think about it. The great Dennis Rodman, next to these tiny little, what are they called? Who cares? They're just teeny weeny, mini. That's it. The Minis. (laughing) The Minis, it's perfect. I gotta start making some phone calls. Where are they? - Who? - The Minis. - I don't know. They said they practice down in Venice Beach. - Well then go find them. You're still here. Time is money. Get me my Minis. (upbeat pop music) - Hey, thanks for giving me a lift. - I don't mind being your chauffeur, but when are you gonna get your own car? - When I'm ready. But if I had that operation, I wouldn't need the pedal extension. - Even with that operation, you still won't be able to reach the pedals. Get over it. Maybe we should find three more players. I think Nick and George bailed out. - That's what you think. - Nick. - Hey. - All right. Looks like we only need two more players. - Hey, what about me? - George. - Hey, George. - The old team is back in action. - [All] Yeah. (clapping) - Yeah, the old dinosaurs are back. - Yeah. You know it. - Hey, what's with the limo? - Hey Minis. Are you still looking for a fifth player? - Minis? - Catchy, huh? Our agent's idea. - Agent? - What agent? - I want that proposal on my desk tomorrow, you hear? (gentle music) (phone beeping) Bob, you're fired. Yeah? What does he want? What, is he nuts? You tell him to call me. I'll cut him down to size. Minis. Get in here. Have a seat. Can I get you anything? - Well, actually. - Okay so you're fine, good. Now, let's get down to business. Whose idea was it to put a midget basketball team together? - [All] Yours. - Not midgets. - Yeah yeah yeah. Dwarves, midgets, whatever. From now on, you're the Minis. Get it? The Minis. Sleepy, Dopey, Grumpy, Sneezy. You might be little, but I'm gonna make you big. Big big big big big. - Well, we're ready for the challenge, and we're gonna give you 110%. - 110%? That's not enough. From now on, I want 200%. I want 500%. I want every inch of you. Hey, I think I just made a funny. (chuckling) This is the big league. We are here to make money, lots of money. - But money isn't everything, you know. - Would you shut up? Let's listen to the man. (chuckling) (sniffing) - Do you smell that? (sniffing) - Don't look at me. - I smell endorsements. I smell commercials. I smell your own comedy special. I smell a miniseries. A Mini miniseries. - So what about a short film? - There you go. - Who are you? - Who am I? I'm your agent. Okay, time is wasting. And Dennis? - And time is money. - That's what I wanna hear. I gotta set up photo shoots, interviews, costumes. - What about basketball? - What about it? - Don't we need to practice? - No problem. Got that covered. - Minis.

Hey, I didn't wanna say anything 'cause I didn't wanna jinx it, but Jack told me today he has some big things planned. So you know what that means. We'll have the money to send you to college. - Mom already told me. - That's great, isn't it? - Yeah, I guess all my dreams have come true now. - What? What did I say wrong now? (gentle music) - Need a hand? - Oh, I'm fine. Thanks, Chimney. Here, this is for you. - What's with the stuffed animal? - You haven't seen my place before, have you? Come on in. Make yourself at home. I'm just gonna put these bags in the kitchen. (cow mooing) Well, what do you think of the decor? That's French for decoration. - So I take it you like cows. So this is what mad cow disease looks like. - I was Miss Bovine a few years ago. And then, I was runner-up in the North American Miss Hosting. Oh. (cow mooing) I could go on and on and on. But, anyway. What did you do today? - Well, I hung around with Dennis Rodman. (cow mooing) - You were hanging out with Dennis Rodman? - And we've been practicing every day. - You put together a basketball team. - Yes, and we're gonna play in the Venice Beach basketball tournament. - You and Dennis Rodman? (cow mooing) - Yeah, we even have the same agent. - You and Dennis Rodman have the same agent? - Yes, and Jack said we're gonna be big big big. - Really? Can I get you something to drink? - Wow, thanks. Anything but milk. (laughing) - You are so funny. You know what? Why don't I make you a nice, home-style Texan meal? - Mm. (upbeat rock music) (siren wailing) (gentle rock music) - Hey guys. The usual? - Sounds good. - Not me. Today, I want my eggs well scrambled. With some home fries. No, I want a grilled chicken salad. Gotta keep in shape, you know? - Woo, you're in a good mood. It's been a while. How's it going? - We've been practicing 24-7, and we're getting better every day. - Well, that's not why I'm in a good mood. Do you remember that sexy blonde that lives in my apartment building? - She's from Paris. - Texas, that is. Well, she almost had a cow when she heard I'm playing basketball, and I'm gonna be a star. I think she's warming up to me. - Chevy, does this Miss Texas like you, or your newfound fame? - What do I care? As long as I get the girl. (cell phone ringing) - Hello? Yeah. Alright. Sure, we're on our way. That was Dennis. Sounds important. I hope everything's okay. - That gold digger's gonna crunch your heart like a crouton. Probably got legs taller than I am. I hate her. What? What are you looking at? - Hi, I'm Megumi Hosogai, and we're down here today at the Venice Beach courts meeting some very, very special basketball players. The Minis. Well little man, tell me about your team. - Well there's really not much to say. It's just me, Roger, Nick, and George, and of course, Dennis Rodman. - He wasn't joking. He's really doing it. - Let's try to get a few words from Dennis. Dennis, I know this tournament is open to everyone, but don't you find it a little unfair having an NBA star playing against amateurs? - That's not what this is all about. This is about showing people, no matter who you are, big or small, when you play as a team, you can do anything, and remember, it's not important if you win or lose. If you do your best, you'll always be a winner. - You're such an inspiration, Dennis. - Stop it, will you? I have a headache. - Get ready, California, because you're gonna be hearing a lot more about The Minis.

Roger. - Susan. - You guys are adorable. Did you know that The Minis have their own online store? - Must have been one of Jack's ideas. - Get over here, come here. You have to take a look. It's unbelievable. I bought all The Minis merchandise that I could get my little hands on. - Oh no. - Oh yes. Look, T shirts, (beeping) backpacks, basketballs, of course, Mini hoops, action figures. - Action figures. - Uh huh. - Life-size? - No. But when you put them in water, they increase in size by 600%. - Not bad. Do you think it would work on me? - Oh silly. There's even gonna be a video game. - You know, I could've gotten all this stuff for free. - I know, I know. But with all the money that's coming in. - Speaking of which, Jack just gave me another check today. - Oh, what are we gonna do with all this money? - I'm sure you'll figure it out. - Oh you're darn-tootin'. You just concentrate on winning that tournament in two weeks. - Yeah, but, where's Chris? - He's doing his thing at the hospital. - He's got a thing? - Mm hmm, volunteering. - I didn't know that. - Well how could you, darling? You're never here anymore. - Susan, I'm doing this for Chris, for us. - Honey, you can't buy your son with money. You are a great father. Even before the team and all of this, you gave Chris everything that he wanted. He's just, growing up. Our baby isn't a baby anymore. - Oh. (birds chirping) - Well. Look who it is. A celebrity. Oh, he's ignoring us. Now that his dad knows Rodman, he thinks he's better than us. Did you hear me? Oh, now Chris is being a snob. His little father's famous. Been on all the talk shows. But he'll always be a loser. Like father, like son. - Jimmy. You really get off by making fun of others, don't you? Does it make you feel like a man when you insult people? Ooh, Jimmy's so cool. You act so hardcore in front of all of your friends, but I wanna know what you're like all alone, one-on-one. Because let me tell you something. My father is not a loser. He wins every single day by putting up with low-lifes like you. And so what if he's a dwarf? My father is bigger than you will ever be.

And now since I have a lot of money, I could finally get that operation. - What operation? - To make me taller. - Say what? - Let me explain. It's a limb-lengthening process. It's where they pull apart your bones about one millimeter per day. - Well that sounds pretty serious. - Everything has a risk. I can't walk for about four months, maybe some muscle loss. Could be some nerve damage. Might be could make me paralyzed. But that's a small chance. But this is my big chance. After about 10 operations, I could be this much taller. - All this for what? A few inches? - Man, I'll sell my soul to be as tall as you. I'm sick of people looking down on me like I'm a freak. - Look at me. To my eyes, we all freaks. - I know.

I don't care about basketball. - Take it easy. - I don't wanna play basketball. - What do you mean? That's what you've always wanted. - No, that is what you have always wanted.

You can do whatever you want. - Then you weren't listening to me. Because I just said I want to be a clown. - Chris, why didn't you tell me this before? - Because you never asked me. (upbeat dance music) - This has been such an interesting evening. I met so many people. - After the party at my place or your place? - It's late, you know. I have an audition tomorrow morning. And you know what? I have a piercing headache. - Lately, you've been having a lot of headaches. ♪ I surrender, la la la ♪ ♪ Move in closer, la la dee da ♪ (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) (speaking in foreign language) ♪ Are you ready ♪ ♪ Come now, come now, come now, come now ♪ ♪ Come now, come now, come now, come now ♪ ♪ Break it down, break it down, break it down, break it down ♪ ♪ Come now, come now, come now, come now ♪ ♪ Come now, come now, come now, come now ♪ ♪ Get down with it, get down with it on fire ♪ ♪ Get down with it, get down with it ♪ ♪ Get down with it on fire ♪ ♪ Get down with it, get down with it ♪ ♪ Get down with it on fire ♪ ♪ They laughing, then my toes ♪ ♪ They like my flow and see how it goes ♪ ♪ They laughing, then my toes ♪ ♪ They like my flow ♪ ♪ And see how it goes ♪ - Minis, I just got you a national commercial.

I got power. I got fame. I got The Minis. Where'd everybody go? - Don't worry, Jack. I'll talk to them. - At least there's one midget who knows how to play ball. - Dwarf. - Whatever. (people chattering) - What are you doing? - Are you kidding? Diapers? He's turned us into freaks. - What's wrong with that? He's just doing his job. He made us famous. Without Jack, we didn't even exist. - Exist? Are you listening to yourself? I can't believe you're on his side. - Yeah, you would say that. You have a family that loves you, a normal life. I need this. Sometimes you need to give a little to get a little. Roger. - I'm through with all this, Chevy. Better get back in there. Organ grinder needs his monkey. - I like money just like everyone else. You're going over the edge Jack, even for you. - If it wasn't for me, these Smurfs wouldn't be anywhere. - Do you know that before the five NBA championship, I used to work at 7-11? And I used to work at the airport as a janitor? - So? - So? That was the time I used to play basketball for the love of the game. I lost it 'til I met Roger, Nick, George, and Chevy. You know, thanks to those guys, I understand that life is more important than money and fame. - Who are you, and what did you do with my Dennis Rodman? - You don't own me. - You're under contract to me. You're all under contract to me. You're nothing without me. - You're nothing without us. (ticking) (shaver vibrating) (upbeat instrumental music) - Those guys just don't get it. I mean, how can anybody say no to all that money? You have to milk it for all its worth. At least you're still gonna do it, aren't you? - We're not The Minis anymore. - Well. (cow mooing) What are we gonna do now? - What are we gonna do? - Of course, silly. I mean, if you're not a Mini, how could things work out between the two of us? (gentle music) (knocking on door) - Chevy? What are you doing here? It's late. Come on in. I'll get you a cup of coffee. Saw the billboards. You guys are all over the place. You must be thrilled. Something's wrong. What happened? - I got fame. I got money. I got the girl I always wanted. But-- - But? - But I'm not happy. I think she was just using me for my money. - I'm not gonna tell you I told you so. But I told you so. Don't you understand that you need someone who loves you for who you are? And not for what you have. Oh Chevy, what am I gonna do with you? - I didn't just lose the girl of my dreams. I also lost the team. I lost my friend, best friend. I need Roger. - Then you know what you gotta do. After leaving a tip. - Maybe I was a little hasty? Did I do the right thing? - Of course you did. - Diapers. We'll give him diapers. Make him cry for his ba-ba. - We put this team together to prove that we could do anything. - Yeah, but now what are we gonna do? - You do what you set out to do. You play basketball. You don't need Jack for that. (doorbell ringing) I'll get it. - But we don't have a team anymore. - Roger. - Chevy. - I know what's important now. - Apology accepted. - What? I never said I was sorry. - Oh come on, man. - It's cool. - Thanks, Rog. - I feel a hug coming on. - Come on, guys. - [Both] Hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug. (clapping) - I think I'm gonna cry. (doorbell ringing) That's gotta be the pizza. - So what are you gonna do about the game? - It's too late in the game to find another player. - What are you doing here? - Well let me guess. You came here to convince us to come back? Well we're not coming back. - Enough's enough. A man's gotta stand up for what he believes in. - Hey, I'm on your side. - We don't care what you have to say. What? What do you mean? - I'm on your side. We're a team, aren't we? I told Jack to hit the road. You know what, let's just roll with it. - Can we do it? (light majestic music) - Together, we can do anything. - You think we can win? - I don't know if this team can win, but you know what guys? You already won me over. (laughing) - Yeah, yeah. - Minis, Minis. (cheering and clapping) - Minis. (intense electronic music) (people cheering) - Welcome to the first annual Venice Beach Basketball Tournament.

Have faith. - But one man did all the work. - Wouldn't have won without Dennis, and you know that. - So where's the victory? Dennis played the whole time, we just stood there and watched.
