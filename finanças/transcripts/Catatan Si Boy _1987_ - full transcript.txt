I don't know how long I have been writing in this journal. Everything I've been through, everything I feel, I wrote it all here. I want my life to be meaningful. I want to succeed in my studies and in my personal life. I always pray and work hard to make my dreams come true. Allah, I hope you hear my prayers and always bless my family. Amen. From the Stupa Borobudur nine, this is Prambors Rasisonia. Good morning, Indonesian youngsters. Enjoy this. - Boy, do you really love me? - Why? Nothing. I'm just worried that one day we can't be together anymore. Don't say that. And it's not only you. I'm scared of losing you too. - Really? - Really. With one condition, no promise. - Morning, Mom, Dad. - Morning. You don't greet me, Boy? - Breakfast first, Boy. - Maybe not. I'm in a hurry. - To pick up Nuke, right? - I have a lot of things to do in campus. - Here, Boy. I've made this for you. - Eat first. This is enough, Dad. Thanks, Mom. How's Nuke? It's been a long time since I saw her. Because you're too busy. Bye, Mom, Dad. Boy, they made you the head of Orientation Week? How do you know? - Morning, Sir. - Morning. - Morning. - Morning, Sir. Thank you. - Peace unto you. - And unto you peace. Hi, Ocha. You look so beautiful today. Ocha, this is the rundown. - Have you sent the letter to BUPERTA? - Yes. We got Mr. Sumaji's approval. We can start the Orientation Week tomorrow. Yud, the equipment for tomorrow, is it ready? All set, except one thing. Fish oil. I'm afraid we don't have enough. You know, kids nowadays love fish oil. If you need more oil, just use brake fluid. With that kind of fluid you will keep on taking a break. If you think it's not enough, then buy some more. It's not that hard. Where should I buy it? - At your grandma's store. Silly. - Why did you ask? Boy. - Nuke's driver gave me this. - What is it? I didn't see Nuke. And the driver was in a hurry. - He didn't say anything? - No. Boy, honey. When you hear this recording, I hope you don't have any regrets about me. Because it all has to happen. I have no other choice, Boy. The condition forces me to make this decision. Actually I want to talk to you in person. But I don't have the heart to do that. Especially if I see your smile, see the way you look at me, and all your kindness. I love you, Boy, more than you ever know. But I can't defy my parent's wishes. Please forgive me. I hope you can understand me. This is my fault. I didn't try hard enough. Kisses and hugs from afar. Nuke. Boy is innocent, Dad. Why do I have to stay away from him? I didn't want to tell you this, until now, the reason I don't want you to have a relationship with Boy. I feel insulted by the staff of your boyfriend's father. They tried to bribe me, to get the license for their business without going through legal channels. I have served this country for 20 years, supervising the regulations in my company. But they think they can tell me what to do. Boy has no idea about that. Do you remember the car that I sent back? That's how they insulted me. They think they can buy everything with money. I'm afraid the same thing will happen to you too. Boy wouldn't do such thing, Dad. Neither would his family. They're all very nice to me. And Boy also... Good afternoon. May I speak to Nuke? Boy, Nuke has already left. I hope you can understand. I've got to go. I'm busy. I'm going, Honey. Come on, Nuke. Don't cry again. Take care of yourself. If you need anything, call me right away Yes, Dad. Nuke. You're my only child. - Good afternoon, Sir. - Good afternoon. - What do you want, Boy? - I need to talk to you. May I? Yes. - Smoke? - Thank you. I know you've been in a relationship with Nuke for quite a while now. Yes. I'm afraid that you will get too close. To me, Nuke is still too young to decide what to do for her future. She has a long way to go. She's still too young. She still has to focus on her studies. I know, every parent is concerned about their children. Including my parents. But I never see life merely as fun. To me, Nuke is still too young to be in serious relationship. Yes. I need you to understand this. Please do not disturb her again. I can't tell you where she is now. Help! Hurry up! Watch out! - Don't! - Where's the necklace? Here. What about me? I just lost a lot of money. Just count everything and I will pay you. Here's my card. - Just this, right? - Thank you. You better keep the jewelry at home. And please call the police. Okay? Oh, right. What should I call you? You can call me whatever you want. Boy is okay too. My name is Reni. Thank you. WELCOME TO POSMA WELCOME TO THE SUCCESSOR OF THE NEW ORDER What's wrong with you? You look like a mess. Any problems? - I'm just bored. - Why bored? - You're silly. I'm not you. - Then what's the matter? Tell me. Why are you dumbfounded like that? -He's coming -Who? - Boy. - You like him? Now I'm curious. Do you think you can get him? Okay. You just wait and see. Look at that girl. Such a coquettish girl. - Which one? - Foreigner. Whenever Boy's around, her eyes are bulging. I noticed it too. She can't keep her eyes off Boy. Just teach her a lesson. Jealous, aren't you? - Get them here. - Okay. Duckies! Come here. Yes, you three! Come here! Oh my goodness! Hey, hey, hey. I heard you call me ugly, fat, dark and still alive. Who do you think I am? You have 15 minutes left. Why don't you die alone? Damn that man. And I just said, you're trying to get us both killed. I don't understand. You've been dating Nuke for three years. Why do you have to break up? That's a shame. I don't understand either. Her mom and dad were nice to me before. - But now they're acting weird. - Many parents are hypocrites. Did you ask her why you have to break up? Ask Nuke? I didn't even see her. She didn't say anything in the recording. All she said is this is her parents wish. She didn't tell you why her parents don't like you? Nope. Maybe she didn't have the heart to tell you I met her father. You talked to her father? Did you say you've already been dating for a month or two, so why do they object to you now? It's hard for me to get over Nuke. Do you think Nuke still loves you? You can't expect too much from her. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Many other parents would love to see their daughters going out with you. You're a nice kid. You've got the look, respectable parents like. What else do you need? Am I right? You scared me. Is Boy home? You always come here to see Boy. Why don't you come for me for a change? You didn't go to campus today? Banana skin. If I step on it, I will slip on the floor. Like in a comedy movie. You found the trap I set for you. I danced all night last night at the club until 3:00 a.m. Was it clubbing or night shift? Did you dance with a girl or a boy? Why are you being so nosy? Of course with a girl. - Annoying. - Are you sure? I am a real man. You want me to prove it? No way. Don't squeeze them too long. You don't want them to hatch. They're not eggs. I've noticed he's been looking troubled since yesterday. What happened? - Troubled like a tangled hair? - Stop your nonsense, Pansy. Nuke left him. So that's why she never comes here anymore. That's what I want to ask him about. I heard that Nuke is being evacuated by her parents. Evacuated? Do you think her house is flooded? I mean they sent her away from Boy. You always misunderstand me. You know I went to the same college with Nuke. Right, Ina? Ina doesn't know about it, even though she and Nuke practice together. - Ina, can I have something to drink? - You too, Emon? No ice for me. The doctor said I'm not allowed to drink ice. Who would give you ice anyway? She will give you acid so you can stop being a pansy. Gosh, Emon. Kendi, you're so nosy. Fine. I won't take you home. Did you drive here? What did you say? Mommy won't let me walk here. It would make my calves big. All right then. You can take me home. Do you think I'm public transport? Remember me? - Do I know you? - You forgot? Typical man. Do you really forget or pretend to forget? You're the one who helped me last time. Right, sorry. Sorry, Miss... -Reni -That's right, Reni. I'm sorry, Reni. Please understand, I'm getting senile. - Who are you here with? - I came alone. What about you? With someone. - With who? - With you. You want something to drink? Thanks, but I've had too much to drink already. You were amazing, Boy. You were like Rambo when you fought those thieves. I didn't know a man like you still existed. Anyone who saw that would do the same. Especially if it's to help a woman. Am I right? But I heard a school kid got hit by a car and died that day. The car just left the scene. Didn't even bother to help. Really? What a crazy guy. Do you want to help me again now? Okay. Take me home. If you want something to drink, help yourself. Make yourself at home. Nobody else is here. I live alone. Give me a second. I'm just getting changed. - Who is this? - Which one? - The little kid that you're holding. - Kiki. She's with her grandma now. What about her father? He left when he knew I was pregnant. We're not officially married. That's why I said people like you are hard to find. - How do you know I'm a responsible man? - From your eyes, your face, your manner. We can tell by the look if someone has a dirty mind. I saw a quote from the Qur'an in your car. That means you're religious. It depends on the person. No guarantee on that. - Boy. - What's up? Do you mind helping me again? Help you do what? Please get me the massage oil in my purse. You don't mind giving a massage, do you? I seek forgiveness in Allah. This must be a test. Good night, Reni. I'm leaving. - Hurry up. - Everybody, to the field. Gather all the firewood. Hey! Kuya! You two, come here! Come quick when you're called. Oh my goodness! Hey, hey, hey. Stand up. Why didn't you bring firewood? I woke up late, I didn't have time to get the firewood. - Don't glare when you talk to me. - I'm not, my eyes are just big. Go. And you... Why didn't you bring the firewood? What do you have there? I don't have any firewood at home, so I brought a gas tank. Idiot! Do you think this place is a restaurant? Are you a son of a general? No, I'm not. You lied. See? You brought the gas tank. I'm really not. I don't care! I said you're a general's son! Starting today, I declare you as a general's son. Now go! - Looking for someone? - Huh? Looking for someone? The one named Vera is actually cute. You're starting again? Better than doing nothing. Maybe I should find a new girlfriend. Oh my goodness! Hey, hey, hey. - May I have your autograph? - Me too. Bite this! Hurry up! I will count to three, and then I will make you do it. One! Two! Three! What's that? - Eat it! - Hurry up! - Why do you scream? - What's going on in here? They forced us to eat the frog. Is that right, they forced you to eat the frog? We will have a meeting during the break. Give her some water. - Hello, who is this? - Vera. - Hi, Vera. How are you? - I'm good. How did you know my number? - Boy, do you want to come to my house? - Is it okay? - Of course it's okay. - And then what? - Up to you. We can go out if you want. - Okay. I will pick you up at 8:00 p.m. -Okay. I'll be waiting -All right. - Bye. - Bye. Jefri! Evening. How are you? - I'm good. - Sit down. Hold on one second. - I'll go get my husband. - Thank you. When did you come back? - This afternoon. - Really? Where are you going? - Peace be upon you. - Hi, Boy. - You want to go now? - Up to you. Meet my friend. - Boy. - Jefri. I'm sorry, Jef. I've got to go. - Good evening. - Mom, this is Boy. Okay, Mom. I'm going. Bye, Jef. - Let's go, Boy. - Excuse me. - Don't be late, okay. - Okay, Mom. Please sit down, Jefri. What's your star sign? Which one do you think is good for me? You're right. How did you know? From your attitude. From your eyes. You must be the daughter of a psychic. What's your star sign? - Taurus. - No need to be taken care of? - Cancer is even worse. - Why? And you could die. Why are you looking at me like that? Am I some kind of antique? I enjoy looking at you. You don't want to kiss me, Boy? I'm shy. Gosh! This is insane! I think I fell under her spell. She's so damn gorgeous. Like, really. I'd be stupid if I didn't take this chance. She's so aggressive. Besides, she looks like a nice girl, she's fun. It's hard to describe. You said you went out on a date with Boy last night? - Yes. - No way. You can believe it or not. - Where did you go? - That's a secret. - I dare to bet. Because she might lie. - Just wait, Boy will come to me. Are you nuts? Don't talk nonsense. I heard that foreign girl is falling for your charm. What did I tell you? There are plenty of fish in the sea. You're right. - You're waiting for her now? - Yes. This is serious, I guess. But I still can't get Nuke out of my mind. I still feel guilty when I go out with another woman. I don't know why. You're too sensitive. You don't know if Nuke feels the same. Boy, your new girl. - Is he the one you're looking for? - He's kind of cute. I don't think Vera's lying. He's coming over. - You still don't believe me? - All right, I believe you now. Good job. - Hi, Andi. - Hi. We're going now, Boy? - Let's go. I'm going. - Bye. Drive carefully. Many traffic lights on the street. That's a shame, Boy is dating that foreigner. I don't understand. What's so good about that girl? Is it because she just got back from abroad? But I think you're prettier that her, Ra. As long as we see you from a distance. - Stop joking! - You're upset, huh? Why are you getting upset so often lately? Well, as a secretary for the head of POSMA, she's failed. After everything she did to get that job, just to get Boy's attention, - look what she got? - Nothing. Shut up! - I think someone is following us. - Who? Why don't you look. Maybe you can recognize the car. I've been noticing it for a while now. It looks like Jefri's car. Who's Jefri? A friend from when I was in LA. Enough, Boy! Let him go! I don't like insolent men! Don't try anything funny. Embarrassing! Making a scene on the street. This is fun! - You can't help it, huh? - How can I? One more drink, please. Ina, so you're dating him now? We're still trying to get to know each other. Thank you. Excuse me for a minute. I need to use the bathroom. Now it's only us. Come on. What do you want? I told you not to try anything funny. Oh my, gosh! - Emon, behave. - I don't care! Okay. That was an amazing performance from Lidia. Now, the next song is from Dodo Zakaria. Good evening and welcome to Ebony Videotheque, and enjoy dancing with us. Kendi, let's dance. Ina, let's dance. Den, I'm borrowing Ina. Bye. - Vera, I'm going with her. - Okay. I'm waiting for Boy. - Sorry, it took so long. - What happened? - We should go home now. - But I like it here. Den, I'm going home now. Please watch Ina for me. Okay. What happened? - Boy, can I learn to swim here? - Anything for you, Pansy. You're too flirty. Kendi, can I learn to swim? Please teach me to swim. Didn't you say you're afraid of water? All right. Jump then. Cold. Like ice water. I can't jump. Help. - I will die. - Relax. Hold your breath. Relax your body. You will automatically float. I'm dead. Do you think I'm made of rubber that can float automatically? Because you're too scared Did you just fart? Boy, he farted in your pool! - You will turn my pool green. - I'm sorry, Boy. Kendi, why did you have to tell him? Because you farted in my face. I think that's enough. I'm tired. Kendi, please push my butt. I can't get out of here. But don't fart again. What did I just tell you? Seriously! It's gonna be war. - That was a bonus. - Stinky butt! - What's going on? Why are you laughing? - You know how he is. This pansy and his poisonous gas. You're funny, Kendi -Come on, drink -Poor Emon. - Hello, Vera. - Hello? Why are you like this? You forgot what you told me last time? What about it, Jef? You're delusional. I told you when we were in LA, we're just friends. Friends? We've been dating for years and now I'm only a friend to you? Yes. Because I don't think we see eye to eye anymore. We fought a lot. I'm sorry, Jef. - I don't want to hear it again. - Give me a break, Vera. No way! I'm tired! Okay? I can't believe it. How you can change so easily. Listen, Jef. Stop talking about the past. I told you from the beginning, I couldn't promise that this will last. Can't you understand? After not seeing you for a while, I think we should break up. Jef. I don't have feelings for you anymore. I don't know why. We just did it for fun. Right? Just for fun? All these years was just for fun? Oh my God! So what we've done was just for fun? But we have come too far! And I never considered it just fun. Now I feel sorry that I respected you. Enough, Jef! There's nothing between us anymore! It's finished! I hate you! - Boy. - Yes. What? - Can I say something? - Yes you can. Just tell me. Why do you laugh? Tell me. I like you. Do you... Why, Boy? We can't. We shouldn't do that. I don't want to. We like each other. It shouldn't be a problem. That's right. I like you. You like me. But I'm sorry, Vera. I really don't want to do that. You're so old fashioned. Lower class. Yes. I am old fashioned. I am lower class. I'm not trying to be a saint. No, Vera. That kind of thing, I don't like it. I mean it. I don't like it. Now you're underestimating me. You're insulting me, Boy. You don't understand how much I like you. I respect you as my girlfriend. But don't compare here with America. We are eastern people. Our culture here is very different. Vera! Can we talk about it? I'm sorry if I offended you. I know you still think of your old girlfriend. You can't take your mind off her! I know that! I ask forgiveness from Allah. - Hey! So how's Vera? You had fun? - Not cool. She's always suspicious. She thinks I still love Nuke. She thinks I don't pay her much attention. - But it's true, isn't it? - Not really. That's how women are. Always suspicious even if we're honest. So what's the point? Might as well just lie to them. They basically like it. Don't you know? If we're too honest, it's not fun for them anymore. - No more challenge for them. - So you always lie to your girlfriend? I have no choice. We're wrong if we lie, and we're still wrong if we're honest. - That's her? - Uh-huh. Vera, someone's waiting for you. Mr. Pulungan! - What is it? - Let's go home together. - Crazy. - You're insane! - I am insane. - She's too much. Excuse me. - Excuse me, Sir. - What is it? I need to talk to Vera. Come on, Vera. Why are you acting weird like this? Come on. Talk. Why don't you think? What do you want? I don't understand. - Just think. - It's you who should think! - You! - You! You have to tell me the truth. Who is Jefri? He's not just a friend, isn't he? You have to tell me the truth too. You're still with Nuke, aren't you? - No. - Swear? I swear. You haven't you answered me yet? What about Jefri? We were close once, when we were both in LA. But it was a long time ago. There's nothing between us anymore. - Swear? - Swear. - Teach them a lesson. - Don't worry. Oh, gosh. Linda, is that a new jacket you're wearing? Vera, why pouting? - Where's your jacket? - Maybe she sold it. She's mad. We'll see. Vera! Enough! Ocha! Enough! Get a hold of yourself! Enough! What's gotten into you? Shit! She doesn't know who I am. People are staring. Enough, Vera. What's wrong? Why do you look upset? What happened? This is ridiculous. People here are tacky. What's the matter? The people here are trashy. - Your friends in college? - Yes. It's all right. That's normal. They just met you. You need time to get along. Tell dad I want to study in LA. I don't like it here. They're out of my league. Boy! - Sorry, Boy. - What's up? It came for you. Post card from Nuke. - When did it arrive? - This morning. I forgot to tell you. She's in London. Vera just called. She wants you to pick her up at the gym. She said you promised to come at 3:00. Oh right! I forgot. - What time is it now? - I don't know. Damn. I'm late. It's your fault. Thanks, Ina. Too many promises will kill you! Hi, Boy. How are you? I'm sorry I didn't write to you sooner. I'm busy with my studies. I even wrote this in class. I hope you're doing well. Still remember me? I hope you don't forget me. I never forget you. Study well. My regards to Ina. From someone who loves you. Nuke. She didn't write her address. - Rin, did you tell me the truth? - What would I lie to you? I know Boy is nice, handsome and he's also rich. It's hard to find a boyfriend like that. Up to you. If I were you, I prefer that guy you dated in LA. What's his name? Jefri? I can't stand him. He likes to control me. I can't do this, that. I just can't stand him. Are you two still together? I told him I want to break up. But he can't accept it. See? It means he still loves you. He's not as cute as Boy, and not as rich. Such a gold digger you are. Money may not be important, but it's necessary. Especially for women like us. It's nonsense if we say we don't need money. - Right, Ven? - You've got a point. But with one condition. No promises! I'll take you home. No problem. - Yeah. Better than waiting here. - It's okay. - I'm sorry, Vera. Hi, Lin, Ven. - Hi. - Finished your exercise a long time ago? - Pretty much. Do you want to go home now? Vera, I'm going now. See you tomorrow. -Bye, Vera -Bye, Boy. Drive safely. I'm going now. Bye. I'm really sorry to keep you waiting so long. She's pouting again. Why are you silent? If you can't come on time, don't promise to pick me up. I didn't know I would have an extra class today. You always do what you want! You could've told me you had an extra class! You could've called! You did it on purpose to upset me. Vera, I come all the way here. You want me to relax? Who do you think I am? Fine! If you can get home by yourself, get out! Get out if it makes you happy! Oh, gosh. Boy! Boy! - What is it? - You don't have class today? Today is a holiday. - What holiday? - My professor is molting his skin. Silly you. Mom, pass me the orange. Dear? Come on. Let's eat now. Why are you sun bathing in the middle of the day? - Where are you going, Ina? - The usual. Mom. Boy, Ocha's here. Hi, Ocha. Hi. Why didn't you go to class today? I'm a little lazy today. Have a seat. Sorry. I was relaxing. Here's your book. Thanks. - You copied it already? - Yes. Vera's boyfriend, Jefri, came to see you. Since you weren't there, he asked me to give this letter to you. What did he want? Boy, if you're a real man, meet me at the Menteng parking lot at 12 midnight. Oh, gosh. I could die here. But I'm not scared. I'm sure God is with me. Want to gang up against me? You're really brave. We have to take revenge. Or else, they will be even more insolent. I'll gather the boys. It's not fair to gang up like that. Don't do that. Let's just forget it. We can't. We have a score to settle with them. Look at you, all battered like this. We can't just sit here. Don't do it. I don't want to cause trouble. My mom would scold me if she knew. - All right. I'll go home now. - Promise me you won't attack them. Bye. I think we're being followed. Look. There's a lot of them. What do they want? Oh no. What's Kendi doing? Kendi, what's going on? Stay out of this. I'm going to kick that man's ass. Oh no. Why? Get out, all of you. I said get out. Hurry up. Oh no. They're going to fight. How dare you beat up Boy. You want to be a tough guy? Let's fight. Hello? Boy? - Boy! Oh no! - Who is this? - It's Emon. - What's wrong? Emon! Oh no! - What are you doing? Why the panic? - Help! It's Kendi! He's giving birth... I mean he's fighting! - This is bad. - Fight? Where? In Kampung Bandan, Boy. By the pagan wagon. Come on. Come on. Come on. Get up. Come on. Take this. Oh, Boy. Where are you, Boy? Oh no. Aunty, Grandpa, Grandma. Oh no. Where are you, Boy? Oh no, he's dead. Boy's here. Boy! Boy! Oh no. Now I'm soaking wet. How dare you, Boy. You're insane, Kendi. Why are you doing this? I can't believe you. Good thing Emon called me. Sorry, Jef. It was not my idea. It's all my friends' solidarity. Maybe you shouldn't act like a girl. Poor you. Let's take you to the hospital. I'll help you. Let's go. I'm sorry, Boy. I couldn't control myself. Kendi, you're cold blooded. Luckily I called Boy. Or else, he would be dead by now. Let's go home. Let's leave. Go on. Leave. That foreigner is just unbelievable. Maybe I should just dump her. Damn. Are you still mad? Boy. Are you still mad? What else should I say to you? I can't lie to myself. I can't force myself to stay with you. Don't impose your will on me. We are different. We're not right for each other. I know, I'm selfish. Forgive me if I'm wrong. I've tried to forget you. But I can't. You're too nice, Boy. If we can't be together, what can I say? I don't want you to love me out of pity. However, I want you to know that I still care about you. All right then. Let's go home now. Boy. - Somebody wants to see you. - Tell them I'm sleeping. I'm not in the mood to meet anyone right now. If you don't see this person, you will regret it. Is it a girl or a boy? Just go. Before the person disappears again. Who is that? That person is waiting for you. Nuke? When did you come back? Why didn't you tell me? This afternoon. I wanted to surprise you. I still don't understand why you just left me like that. That's what my father wanted. I couldn't say no. Let's talk in my room. I hate you, Boy! Vera. What's happening? Why are you crying? Why? Mom. I want to go back to LA. I don't like it here! I don't like it. There, there. Calm down, Dear. I will talk to your father. There, there. I still love you too. Nobody can replace you. Nobody. - Really? - Really. I will go to your house. I will explain to your father that he's wrong about me. Don't do that, Boy. I'm afraid he will get upset again. Why are you afraid? I've promised my dad that I will stop seeing you. That's why he let me come back. So? So if you want, we can date behind dad's back until we get dad's approval. I don't mind that, but for how long? I don't know. But I will try to soften him up. Maybe one day he will change his mind. - So, we're dating in secret now? - Yes. So when I was away, you were dating that foreigner? Yeah. Just for a short time. - You! - But not anymore. I panicked. Stop it! I won't do that again! - Really? - Really. With one condition, no promises. I'm finally back with her again. I will take the risk. If her dad finds out, worst case scenario, he will marry us. Am I right? Later.
