(Upbeat music playing) Hi, glenda. Sorry. I'm early! My god, it's a miracle. (Chuckles) Did she pay for last week? She did when I reminded her. (Coughing) Sorry, glenda. Sorry. Hi, Geoffrey. Hey, mavis, I've been working on this all week! (Scatting) Ball change. Mavis: Excellent! (Women giggling) (Sneezes) Hi, Dorothy. Sorry, mavis. It's the pollen. Mavis: I know. Okay, there, there, there... You go around... Then you clap again. Oh! Mavis: Ah, Sylvia, you didn't practice, did you? Sylvia: I know... I know... Excuse me. Is this the tap class? Oh, my god. It's Princess di. Hi, I'm mavis. I run the class. Can I help you? Am I too late to join? No. (Chuckling) Let me just sign you up. Uh... Have you taken any tap before? Well, I did start another class, yes, but to be perfectly honest, I didn't like the teacher. Are you English? How did you know? (Chuckling) Uh, lucky guess. Oh, gee. I thought I'd lost my accent. (Chuckles) Mrs... Miss... Mrs. Andrews. Mrs. Mrs. Lionel Andrews. Andrews, Lionel. All right. And what should we call you? Oh, yes. Vera. Okay, Vera. Yeah. Welcome to class. Now, it's $10 for every lesson and you can pay Mrs. Fraser after the class. And, uh, I was wondering how many there were in the class? Oh, not too many, just about the right amount. They're like flies. They come out in the summer and then they just disappear in the winter. (Chuckling) Right. And, uh, is that where we get changed? Yes, uh, I'll have Sylvia you show... No, no, no, no. That's all right. I can manage. I'll just get rid of these for you. Thanks. Thanks a lot, Vera. Good evening, Rose. Nice of you to join US. If that... If that boy of mine would get himself a job instead of... I'm sorry, mavis. You know I hate being late for class. Don't worry about it, honey. I'm just glad you're here. Mavis: All right, come down towards the mirror. Sorry, Andy. Thanks, lynne. Come towards the mirror, everyone. Okay, just... Dorothy, put the bag down. You won't need it. Just put it down. Geoffrey, how would you like to come to the front of the class, huh? All right, just switch with Dorothy. All right... Mrs. Fraser, whenever you are ready. We're gonna start with the warm up we did last week. Fabbo. Okay, everybody, here we go. Mrs. Fraser, whenever you're ready. Do you remember what it was? It's tap, tap, tap, tap, step, hop, step, flap, ball change. Tap, tap, from the ankle, step, hop step, flap, ball change. Flap, heel, stamp, ball change. Flap, heel... Oh, hi, Vera... I'm sorry. Vera, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Vera. So, sorry to keep you waiting, everyone. That's okay. Okay, here we go. Flap, heel, stamp... Vera, would you like to stand in the back so maybe you can pick it up a little quicker. You know... Don't worry about it. If you get it wrong, you're not gonna get fired. It's not an audition. All right. Whenever you're ready, Mrs. Fraser. I'm just sorting my music. Glenda, it's just that Patrick got US a gig tonight. You know, I'd like to get out of here as soon as I can. Don't blame me. I'm always ready. Yeah. Right. (Chuckling) Okay... (Whispering) There's some very peculiar writing on the bathroom wall. That's not US. Cub scouts. Five, six, seven and... Toe, toe, toe, toe, step, hop, step, flap, ball change. Good. From the ankle, Geoffrey. Step, hop, step, flap, ball change. Flap, heel, step, ball change. (Playing lilting tune) Flap, heel, step, ball change. Flap, heel, flap, hold. Follow, Rose. (Chuckling) All right, light on your feet everybody. Very good. Very good. Flap, heel, flap, ball change, flap, ball change. Step, hop, step, flap, ball change. ¶ You treat me coldly how we doing over here? ¶ Each day of the year ¶ you always scold me ¶ whenever ¶ somebody is near, dear ¶ it must be... You think this is easy? ¶ ...mean to... Well, you're right. It is. ¶ You shouldn't ¶ because can't you see ¶ what you mean to me? Let's hear it for mavis Turner, my lady. ¶ You shouldn't because can't you see ¶ what you mean to me? ¶ Oh, darling ¶ can't you see ¶ what you mean to me? ¶ (scatting) (Crowd cheering) Goodnight and god bless. (Crowd cheering) They want US to do more. They don't deserve you. You're too good for them. Yeah, uh... Honey, I was doing something on the end of the last song tonight that I kinda liked. But the end of the second chorus is all wrong. What? You mean the riff? It's too much. You don't need to add anything. Uh-uh. (Stuttering) It felt right. You know with the... No, but you're right, it's wrong. It's wrong? It's right. I'll just go back to the old way. Do it the way I told you to do it. Yeah. (Knocking on door) Come in. Hi, kids. Great set. Thanks, Jerry. And you... You are really good. Mavis: Thank you. And believe me, I know quality. And the people out there, they loved you. My people. Well, Patrick... Hey, listen, I want you to come back next week and play Saturday night for me. What do you say? Yeah, well, we'll let you know. Great. Love you. Um, Jerry, what about our money for tonight? Just pop by the office and pick up the cash. And do an encore next time, will you, buddy? Catch you. Thanks. (Door closing) Creep! Yeah, but at least he's a creep who wants US to come back next Saturday. I'm doing him a favor, okay? Okay. How's your throat? Fine. Where's your scarf? I lost it in Pittsburgh. Jesus, mavis. Are you going to take care of yourself or what? Uh. (Giggling) Mavis: That was a good set. (Patrick laughing) (Mouthing) It just seems like nowadays there are fewer and fewer buses, right? Yeah. I mean, the weather's not that bad right now, but later on... Oh, I know, I just... I just hate waiting for the bus in the snow but sometimes I have to when my husband takes the car. He's traveling right now. He's in sales. Aluminum products. Aluminum, huh? Do you live on hartington? (Stuttering) I live on bedford. Uh, it's just off, well, off hartington. Oh, yeah. I was just asking you because I... I thought I saw you walking there the other night. Really? Thursday. (Stuttering) Do you live on hartington? No, no, I just go to the methodist church there. Is it choir practice? Pardon? Uh, Thursday, the methodist church. No, no, I don't sing. I just work in their kitchen. Cooking for the homeless. Really? Yeah, we make lunch for them every day, including holidays. I'm the, uh... I'm the meal planner. Really? Well, I try to make every meal nutritious, well balanced, yet fun. Well, I think that's a true gift. Making a meal like that. I mean, it's... It's better than singing. (Laughs) (Humming) (Flushing) He's very brave, Andy, isn't he, Geoffrey? Being the only man amongst all US girls. I mean, he must feel very awkward at times. I wonder why he comes? Maybe you should ask him. Oh! I already have. He says he enjoys it. (Laughs) Well... Well, yes, possibly. You know his wife left him, don't you? I mean I suppose that's why he's here. I suppose he enjoys the company. You know... Oh, yes. I hope you don't mind but I've been meaning to ask you what is Andy short for? Oh, it isn't short for anything. It's long for Ann. Excuse me. Oh! Step, shuffle, ball change, stamp. Step, shuffle, ball change, stamp. Cross, turn, clap, clap. Cross turn, flap, ball change... All right? Let's try it. Let's try it. Nice and easy. Mrs. Fraser. Same tempo as last week. Here we go. Five, six, seven, eight... (Fast-paced music playing) Okay, hold it, hold it. All right, let's take it again it from the top, all right? A little slower this time, glenda. Okay? Five, six, seven, eight! (Fast-paced music playing) Hold it. Glenda! Glenda! It's too fast. It's exactly the way it was last week. Maxine: Uh, no. I mean, it was slower last week. Uh, it doesn't affect me but... It was definitely slower. Definitely. Dorothy: Definitely, yes. Wasn't it, Geoffrey? Wouldn't you say? (Stuttering) Oh... I... at the last... It was a little... You were playing it too fast, dear. Anyone else? You? Don't you have any suggestions? No, I... All right. This is going to be the one. Here we go, glenda. And five, six, seven, eight! Step, shuffle, ball change. (Plays slow tempo) It's ridiculous. Glenda! Glenda! What's the matter with you? It's too slow. You just said it was too fast. Yeah, well, now I'm saying it's too slow. No doubt, when you make up your mind you will let me know. Uh-huh... Take it through, will you, lynne? Yes. Glenda... I'm sorry. Look, it was my fault. I don't have to do this. I have my social security and my pension. The money you are paying, remember? I was the only one who answered your ad. Yes. I know that. Look, I've just been under some financial stress lately. Glenda, i'm... No excuse for bad manners, right? (Chuckles) Glenda, I can't do this without you. Come on. (Clicks tongue) Come on. I need you. Mrs. Fraser, whenever you're ready. Five, six, seven, eight. Step, shuffle, ball change, step. Step, shuffle, ball change, step. Cross, turn, clap, clap, cross, turn, flap, ball change. Step, shuffle, ball change, step. Step, shuffle, ball change, step. Cross, turn, clap, clap... Pam leichner... First floor offices. That way, please. Thank you. (Giggles) (Woman instructing) Woman: One, two, three, four, five, six... (Knocking on door) Yes, come in. Ah! Yes, hello. Mavis Turner. Mavis, how are you? Good. No, really. How are you? Good. How's the tap class going? Good. It's small, but good. So you're sticking with it? Yeah. Good for you. (Sighing) Well... (Clears throat) Well... You're probably wondering why I've asked you here. I'm taking away all your business and you want to buy me off. (Chuckling) I think it's fairly well known that Dale, my husband, and I do a great deal of charity. Yes, I do read about it. Our committee has been asked to organize a charity event for the save the children fund. And we came up with a terrific idea for an evening of song and dance. And of course they want me to run the entire shooting match. Of course. Now, I didn't want to use just professionals or people from my studio. I wanted to give the little local people a chance as well. And that's why I've asked you here. You want US to do something? Yes. What, cater? (Laughing) Now, mavis, I hope you're not carrying some kind of a grudge. Pam, I would only... There's no way I could have hired someone who had never taught before. And really, a smidgen of chorus work in New York just isn't going to cut it here. Pam, if you will recall my resume, it was more than just a smidgen... Mavis. Mavis. When was the last time you danced professionally? Six years ago. Teaching is very important to US here. As a teacher you have to be committed, you have to be dedicated. I thought you had to be a dancer. Our teachers are young. They are professional. They have a future in front of them. Anyway, back to the charity. Now, what I'd like to do is to get together two or three of the smaller groups and put together a big, but simple, tap routine. Now, your reputation will not be on the line here. I will provide a professional choreographer. Trust me, she can make even the worst students look good. So, may I put you on my list? Okay. But on our own. Don't you think you should accept my help? You can put US on your list but I'll choreograph my people in my own way. And I'll call you next week. Don't worry, Pam. We won't embarrass you. Excuse me, Sylvia. Do you chew gum because you've given up smoking? No. Because I might meet someone nice. How do I keep finding it everywhere? That's because I keep putting it everywhere. You know, I could really use someone like you at home, Vera. Anybody? Oh, yes, thank you. I really think we should do something. Do we have a problem? Mavis isn't here yet. Oh, dear! Just follow me, girls. I've got music in my soul. (Laughing) (Vocalizing) I thought you said you all couldn't move. You bet your tail we can move. The problem being in my case, is that it all moves in different directions. Careful, you'll knock your wig off. Uh, can I make a suggestion? Geoffrey is about to make a suggestion. (Chuckles) Hey, Geoffrey, I hope your sex life is as busy as your sweater. (Laughing) Why does she always have to be so rude to him? Yes. Rose: Well, now, come on, ladies. Let the man speak. Sylvia: Come on, everyone. Quiet. Yes, come on, Geoffrey. What were you going to say? I was going to say, that if we want, why don't we start the warm-up while we're waiting? That is brilliant! That is just brilliant, Geoffrey. (Sylvia snorting) Rose: Well, I'm starting if nobody else is. All right. Come on... Right behind you. (Vocalizing) (Playing slow-paced tune) (Tempo increases) (Playing fast-paced tune) (Women laughing) (Women screaming) Whoa, Geoffrey, look at you. (Piano stops) (Playing slow-paced tune) (Pounds) (Chuckling) Geoffrey, that was fabulous. Why don't you get Mrs. Fraser's chair, all right? Hidden talents, huh, glenda? Okay, everybody. Hi. Come on. I've got something really important to tell you. First of all, I'm sorry I'm late, you guys. But I have just come from a meeting with Pam leichner. You know the lady who runs the performing arts center. Some of you may know her. Oh, yes. Anyway she told me that she is organizing the biggest benefit show that this town has ever seen. I mean professionals will be in it. Amateurs... amateurs from all over the city. All the local dance academies are gonna take part in it. And she called me because she wants US to be in it. Isn't that great? Oh, my god! Oh... Would we have to... I mean... You'd want US all to be in it? Of course, I want you to be in it. Andy, it's gonna be a lot of fun. I mean, we're, we're in a theater and... Do you know why this is so good for US, you guys? Because it gives US something to work for. I mean, it's a goal. We need a goal. Besides, I want to show that dame over at the performing arts center just how terrific you guys are. (Laughing) Oh, what charity is it? Save the children. When you say we would be in it, um... Geoffrey, we'd do a number... Look, you already know a lot of steps. I mean we just put it together and... And we go out there and show them what we can do, you know. It won't be anything more difficult than what we've already done. Anyway, it's only for charity. Charity, yes. Yeah. I mean, they probably wouldn't expect much, right? Yeah. Well, I'm no ginger Rogers, so... Right, Geoff? (Indistinct speech) Okay. Okay, you guys. Hold it, you guys. This is the wrong attitude. I mean, as far as I'm concerned, they're lucky to get US. You know, I just... I thought it was kind of an honor they asked US. That's all. I wouldn't ask you to do something I didn't really believe you could do. Look, think about it okay. Just think about it. If you don't wanna do it, we don't have to do it. We just won't do it. Mavis, uh, personally I think it's a great idea. I would have preferred save the parents but... Okay, count me in. Mavis: Oh, honey! Oh, Sylvia, you won't be sorry. It will be the best. We'll have more fun doing it. We'll be good. We'll be good. A theater. A theater, Rose. Geoffrey, we're gonna be in a theater. (Inaudible) Shh, shh! Dorothy? What, Dorothy? We're really gonna knock the socks off of them. (All laughing) The woman's right. We're going to go out there, we're gonna show them what we've been doing here. Yeah. Yeah. I bet we can show them anything they can do, we can do better! Yeah. Yeah. Right? Right! Right, glenda? Why wasn't I told about this? Well, I wanted to wait until we were all together. Nevertheless, I am very familiar with this sort of thing. And I should have been consulted. Five, six, seven, eight. Shuffle off to buffalo. Shuffle off to buffalo. Shuffle off to buffalo. Shuffle off to buffalo. (All laughing) (Speaking indistinctly) Jerry, hi. I'm sorry I'm late. Honey, your partner called. He's not doing the gig tonight. What? The guy's got an attitude problem. Are you sure? Let me call him. No. No. Listen to me. The guy had a hit seven years ago that nobody remembers and he thinks he's a genius. Screw him, you know? Screw him. Jerry, please. I don't need a genius. I need somebody good and I need somebody here. Now, look, you stick around, work with my boys, work out a set. I don't work without Patrick, Jerry. Well, then there's nothing I can do for you. Call me when you decide to dump the schmuck. (Rock music playing) Patrick, I wasted two bus fares getting to the club. I tried to call, you weren't home. I didn't have the number where you did that class. I'm sorry. The guy liked US. We could have had steady work... Mave, I'm just saying we could do better. Did you get any dinner? Come. Let's go home. You know what else? I really wanted to sing tonight. Then you can sing to me tonight. Oh. (Upbeat music playing) (Humming) That's too hard. (Music ends) (Sighing) (Orchestral music playing) (Tempo quickens) (Humming) Ha! Hey! (Vocalizing) Five, six, seven, eight! Ah! Whee-ha! Ha! Hey! Ah-ha! Hey! Hey! Ho! Ah-ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Uh! Ah! Five, six, seven, eight! Ha! (Exhales sharply) Oh, lynne. I didn't see you. I'm sorry. I... No, no, no. It's fine. I just didn't know you were standing there. I'm sorry. No! You know what I was doing. I was going over some stuff for tonight in the hopes of staying one step ahead of you guys. And I got a little carried away. I wish I could dance like that. You dance great. No, not really. There's a difference. Yeah, but I've been doing it for a lot of years, remember? (Chuckling) Too many years. No. There's a difference. Oh! Phew. (Chuckling) (Sighing) Lynne, are you okay? You seem a bit down. One of my old ladies died this morning. I'm in geriatrics this week. Oh... To be honest, it's the first patient I've seen die. I didn't think that I was going to be this upset. Fine nurse I am, right? I think what upset me so much was that nobody ever came to see her. And all last night she just kept wanting to talk with me. And we were extremely busy. Some nights it's very empty, but last night it was very busy. I'm sorry. It's just that when I told the doctor that she had died he said, "good, we needed another bed." And I have to get used to it, aren't I? Yes. You are. Somehow it makes it seem worse, doesn't it? Did you always want to be a dancer? Did I always wanted to be a dancer? (Chuckles) Yeah, I suppose I did. I bet you were really good. I was okay. Pretty hot stuff in my day. Do you miss it? Yeah. Sometimes I do. But not so much now that I'm teaching. I mean I see you guys getting better and it makes me feel better about everything. Did you ever do any big shows? Oh, yeah. I worked all the time. I did a lot of big shows. It was mostly in the chorus, but still, I... Actually the last show I did... Do you remember a show about eight years ago called the wonderful years? No. Too young. (Laughs) Anyway, the music I was dancing to in the other room, that's from that show. Oh, Leonard had a wonderful score. Anyway, I got to understudy the star in that show and she got sick and I went on. I bet you were great. I killed them. I did. I killed them. It was only for a week, but for a week I killed them. After that she came back and finished the run. But some good things started to happen to me. You know I... I got my picture in the paper a couple of times. I got some really good auditions. I even audition for Bob fosse once. I didn't get the job, but I got to touch his sleeve. You know they told me if I'd stuck around I could have... Anyway, I left town shortly after that. What happened? I fell in love. (Upbeat music playing) Good. Mavis, was I all right in the middle section? Yes. You were fine but take it easy, honey. I mean this is a short step. It's like life, enjoy it! Oh, yes, sure. Easy. Rose, you're still having trouble with the scissors, yes? Cross... Yeah, but the thing is I don't really see myself as a scissors person. (Chuckling) Why are you still on the wrong foot? You start on the wrong foot every time! I know, it's chronic. Well, how can I help you? I just seem to use whatever foot comes to hand. I'm going to kill you! Are you all right, darling? Mmm. Okay, everybody. Um, take a minute. Uh, Andy, where are you? Look, ma, I'm dancing. Michael Jackson, eat your heart out! Michael Jackson, now that is one fine little man, and I ain't kidding! You like them small, do you, rosey? Well, I like them small, honey, but not that small. Do you like small men, Dorothy? I try not to think about it. (Speaking indistinctly) There'll be a number for each... Thanks, Vera. There'll be numbers, you won't have to worry about anything. I'd like to start again if you will. I wanna see it just one more time... Glenda: Just a minute. I don't suppose any of you know, and I don't suppose that any of you care, but today is the anniversary of Irving Berlin's birthday. And I for one could not let it pass without tribute. ¶ He was a jolly good fellow ¶ he was a jolly good fellow ¶ he was a jolly good fellow ¶ which nobody can deny ¶ which nobody can deny ¶ it's my birthday next Tuesday. You wanna start something or what? (Stifling laugh) Yes, we're starting. I would like to start... That was beautiful, glenda. I would like to start from the crisscross, I wanna see it one more time before we leave. Okay, go right into it. Five, six, seven, go! (Piano playing) One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Hold your lines. Hold your lines. Hold your lines. (Speaking indistinctly) Bye. See you guys. Rose: Hmm, all right. I'm going to a wedding this Saturday. Oh, anyone you know? Lionel's cousin. It's going to be a very big affair. They're having a tent. I do love weddings, don't you? Not a lot. Mine was lovely, I must say. Mine was quite boring. I'm sorry I went. Do you know, I remember every detail of mine. So can I. Meet you at the car, Rose. All right, baby. See ya. Do you remember your wedding, Maxine? When it comes to my weddings, instant recoil, sweetheart, ugh. Instant recoil. Oh, have you been married a lot then? Just twice, Vera. Don't get excited. Yes, Andy? I just wanted to say that I felt better tonight. What I mean is that I felt more relaxed. I mean, I know I'm not very good. Andy, why do you come here? Why? Yeah. I mean, what do you get out of it? Well, I come because... I come because it's the only thing in the week that I do for me. Everything else is for other people. Oh. You know what I get out of it? I just love having a good time. I just love the laughing. I haven't laughed like that in years. I mean, tonight, when you hit Geoffrey, I thought his hair was gonna fall out, you hit him so hard. You are improving, you know. You are! Okay, bye. Goodnight. Thanks. Yeah. Rose, um, did your boy get a job yet? Mmm-mmm. Everywhere he tries it's the same story. You know, all the while he was at school, we kept telling him, no qualifications, no work. Mine's just the same. He doesn't know what he wants. One minute he's in a rock group, the next minute he's in a coma. You know what the latest is? Now he wants to go to art school. Art school! He can't even draw a breath without fainting. (Laughing) Look, about your boy, I've got a job opening at my store. Now, if he's interested, you know where the shop is, get him to come and see me, okay? Oh, thank you, Maxine. I think I will. Thank you. Goodnight. Sylvia: Come on. (Car engine starts) Can I give you a lift? Sure. Glenda: Mmm-hmm. Mavis: What? Glenda: She is giving him a ride. So what? So she is giving him a ride, so what? It's always those quiet ones. (Car engine starting) You are a wicked old broad at times, glenda. All right, we'll see. Well, thank you so much for the ride. I... I would ask you in for a cup of coffee or something, I don't know... Oh, that's okay. Um, I have to get home. My husband needs the car. All right. How was... I'm... No, go ahead. Go ahead. No, please. I was just going to say, some other time if you like. Yeah. Thank you. Goodbye. Sorry, we're closed. Can I talk to you? Uh, no, I'm sorry. I've got an appointment this morning. So do I. I'm Alan, Rose's son. Alan! Maxine: Like I told your mother, it's not much more than this, pick-ups and deliveries. But it's a start. I mean, we're not saks but we're growing. So, what do you think? What do you think, Mrs. Grozinski? What do I think? I think you'll be okay. But if you get one scratch on this little baby and you're in shit city. How's he behaving himself? Oh, he's a good kid. I'm very pleased with him. Well, his daddy told me to tell you, if he gives you any trouble... If he gives me any trouble, he's out. Come on, Rose. He's doing fine. (Indistinct speaking) Do you like it? It's incredible. Let me guess, Judy jetson? I was in town, and I called into the dance center, and I simply couldn't resist it. (Laughing) Do you like it, Maxine? I think it's very nice, very nice. Very nice, yes. Vera: Not too bold? (Women laughing) Be careful they don't mistakenly launch you. (Laughing) Rose: Well, what we need is a man's opinion. Yo, Geoffrey, is that too bold or is that too bold? Well, uh, no... I mean, it's... Well, that sums it all up. (Women laughing) Rose: Thank you, Geoffrey. (Humming) I hope you don't mind my asking, Andy, but why do you cover yourself up all the time? Why do I what? Well, what I mean is you've got a nice body. In its own way. Really? Really! It's long, but it's nice, you know. It seems a pity to cover it up all the time. I think you're being a bit rude, don't you? I wasn't being nosy or anything. There's nothing to be nosy about. I wear what I wanna wear. Sorry, Vera. What happened? Oh, I was just, um, getting out of my car and I seemed to lose my balance. It was really dumb. (Chuckles) Geoffrey: But, I mean, you'll be okay? Andy: Oh, I'm fine. I used to be fat, you know. Really! Just after I had my baby. I was almost as big as you. Seventeen she is now. All she ever thinks about is horses. Horse-mad she is. Well, it'll keep her off the streets, won't it? Okay, everybody, the break is up. Can I please see you in your opening positions. Opening positions. All right, we still got a lot of work to do. The show's not very far away. By the way, thank you, everybody, for staying late tonight. All right, uh... I would like to take it from the step we did before the break. Do you remember what that is? It's cross, cross, open, cross, turn. All right? Now, I would like to try that in groups. So, you are standing with your back to the audience. The right arm is up, the left hand is on your hip. Stay stark still. Do absolutely nothing. So far I like it. (Women laughing) And then, after the introduction, which will be the third eight, right? You start the steps, so you guys will go on the one of the third eight. You guys will go on the one of the fourth eight, right? And, Geoffrey, you're gonna go on the one of the fifth eight. And remember, you have to turn, this has gotta be a fast turn. So that when you land the right arm is out and the left hand goes to the hat. Are we having hats, mavis? I didn't hear you say anything about hats. Yes, we're having hats. (Gasps) Right, Max? I forgot, I'm sorry... Okay. Come on, let's try this, everybody. Please concentrate. It's very complicated. This is the third eight. You're ready? Five, six, seven, go! (Vocalizing) Good! Go! (Vocalizing) Geoffrey... (Vocalizing) Turn! (Screams) (All clamoring) Mavis, you're forgetting the canes. All: Canes? No, wait. Don't panic! Don't panic! Thank you, Mrs. Fraser. You're right, um... I have forgotten the canes. Hats and canes... You're asking for trouble. All right, so, everybody, please. The cane is up in the air, on the turn, the left hand goes to the hat, the cane lands firmly on the floor. Lynne, demonstrate that. Okay. When you make the turn, the left hand is on the cane, and the hat lands firmly on the floor. Mavis: No, no, no, that's not what I said, I said... Oh, wait a minute, Geoffrey, don't move. Don't move, I want you down here in the solo spot. Just stay there. Wait, we'll get it. Let's try it again. Come on, here we go. (Clears throat) And... (Vocalizing) Mavis, can I ask you a question? What? Yes, Max. Uh... What do you mean, a solo spot? You mean Geoffrey? Is he going to be special or something? I'm not being funny or anything, Geoffrey. Geoffrey is special inasmuch as he's the only man here and sticks out like a sore thumb. Oh, I see. Okay. Excuse me. Yes, Rose. I can think of someone else who'll sticks out like a sore thumb. Well, maybe Rose should be upfront with Geoffrey, then. Or I'd be very happy to change. Rose: Oh, no, no, Geoffrey. If I'm gonna be ignored, I prefer to be ignored at the back. Thanks all the same. You guys, this is a big heavy tap number, right? Mmm-hmm. You are working as a team. There is no solo spot. There will be sections where I'll have you dance in groups of twos or threes, but even if I give you a step on your own, it doesn't mean that you're a big superstar, you know, there is no solo spot. We're a team. Yes? Right. Of course. Okay. Yes? Did you say do a step on our own? This is so exciting. Mavis... Mavis. Yes? Are we gonna be getting some canes, I mean, to practice with? To practice with? Yes. Andy: Mavis. Yes? If we're gonna have canes, I'd like to have them as soon as possible. Absolutely. The sooner the better. I was gonna suggest you bring something in next week, okay? So does that mean for tonight that we should just... Pretend, honey, like you do with your husband. Go through the motions and make like you're enjoying it. Incidentally, there's gonna be some pretty fast bouncing around in this number, some of you may have bust problems. So wear something good and firm, yes? Mavis: And listen, you know something when you turn around and face your audience for the first time... Baam! It's gotta have style. Boom! It's gotta have the three t's. You know what the three t's are? Teeth, taps and tits. (Women laughing) You've only got two t's, right, Geoffrey? Don't worry, Geoffrey. I've got plenty. You can have some of mine. (Rose laughing) Mavis: Okay, everybody, let's have you in your opening positions, please. Right away, please, your opening positions. Thank you. All right. Legs crossed, everything still. You're neat, you're very tidy. Now, you hold this and you keep holding it. Don't move a muscle. My husband would be good at this. Okay. Let's try it again, shall we? Let's really do it... You know what we need? We need some music, huh. How about a little music? (Snoring) Great. All right. Go! (Mavis vocalizing) Turn, go. (Vocalizing) And Geoffrey. (Vocalizing) Turn. You've got to turn the other way. That's right. You gotta do that the other way. Let's try that again. We'll get this. Let's try and get this while we're young. All right, Dorothy, just a little bit smaller, right. And Sylvia, get rid of the gum. I want to see your teeth not hear them. Vera, no, Vera! Come on, Vera. The theater's gonna be filthy. You can't clean the whole theater! Okay, here we go. Ready? Five, six, seven, go! (Vocalizing) Turn. (Vocalizing) Turn, good. Geoffrey, cross, cross, open, cross, turn, turn... Mavis: Oh, Geoffrey... Rose: I got it. (Vocalizing in horse voice) Turn. Good. Geoffrey... (Continues vocalizing) I'll never get it. Geoffrey, you got it. You got it, you know... So you're just choking on the turn, just relax, you got it. Okay, class. Come here. If everybody will really concentrate and do this step right just once, we can all go home! No pressure. All right, everybody, opening positions. Glenda! Glenda, hit it! (Snorts) Five, six... Five, six, seven and... (Vocalizing) Great! (Vocalizing) Good, go and... (Vocalizing) (Gasps) (In accent) By George, I think he's got it! (All cheering) (Vocalizing) (Chuckling) That's good. Yeah. Well, not good. Adequate. You know, there's something that, uh, I've been meaning to ask you but, I didn't know whether I should or, you know... I didn't know whether I knew you well enough... Um... What? Well... I just... I was wondering how long you'd lived alone? Uh... Three years in December. It must have been... It must have been very difficult for you. Well... at first. At first I kind of just let myself go. Self-pity, I guess. If you're gonna survive, you're going to have to find some kind of a system or a daily routine. Something. Although, like about a year later I... I'm just going on and on about this... No, no, no. I really wanna know. Well, I have to say, uh... After about a year, I thought, you know, this daily routine is turning you into a Mrs. Fraser or something. (Laughing) No. Yeah. No, it's because, when you live alone, it's so easy to turn in on yourself. So, I thought I should... (Vocalizing) Or something. I wonder if it takes as much courage to live alone as it does to live with someone else? (Piano music playing) (Upbeat music playing) Yeah, that's better. Andy... I'm just still having trouble with this. I can't... I don't have any control over it. Well... You're acting kinda like it's your enemy. You know, you grab that sucker. Your assignment this week is to make friends with your cane. Sylvia, do you know the step in the middle? The thing is I know what it is in my head but I can't get it through to my feet. Then stop thinking about it. Oh! Okay. Just do it. Rose, you know what I'm going to say don't you? Stop hiding? We wanna see you. I mean, girl, if you got it, flaunt it. Honey. (Both chuckling) Dorothy, you're still... Both: Pushing it too hard. Yes. Yes? Right. Yes. Ah, Rose, you're a step behind. Mmm-mmm, sweetheart, I'm 40 years behind. (Laughing) Well, practice, honey. Tonight your concentration was terrific. Well, thank you, mavis. Okay, anybody else, anything? All right, that's it. Good class. Thank you very much. (Playing finale) Maxine, the hats! Next week, definitely. I'm sorry... We got to have them. Oh, mavis. Yes? Yes, there is one thing we were all wondering about. Yeah. As it's a real show and everything, will we be having Mrs. Fraser or proper music? I heard that. I'm not being funny or anything, dear. Glenda: I'm sure. And just who is the royal "we" you are referring to? It's just a general topic of conversation with one or two girls, that's all. I see. Well, you know something, it's a good, um, question. Actually, I don't know. Glenda would know. (Stuttering) Well, how do they usually, in this kind of thing, how does it usually go down? In my experience, it depends entirely upon the quality of the people involved. Mavis, I will wait for you outside. Vera, I have spoken with Pam leichner. They're providing a proper orchestra. They're even giving US an orchestration. But I wanted to tell... I was being perfectly reasonable. It's not reasonable to hurt that old lady's feelings. God, Vera, you've got the sensitivity of linoleum. Well, we need to know, don't we? Well... (Speaking indistinctly) Well, thanks. Bye. That was ray gold from Los Angeles. Oh, yeah? You met him. I introduced you back when you were doing all that old-fashioned Broadway crap. He helped promote my song. Gee, honey, I don't remember him. He said as soon as we get a gig out there, he'll bring people down to see US. He gave me the name of a club. It turns out the guy who runs it has heard of me. Good. He promised me a booking, mavis. Start packing, baby. How are we gonna get out there? Oh, it's all set. I found this service where you drive someone's car for them cross-country. Well, if someone needs a car in L.A. next week, it couldn't be more perfect. Patrick, this show that I'm doing is important to me. I care about these... Mavis... It's great that you've got a hobby. I'm talking about real life here. Real life! Are we starting or what? Yes, glenda. Sorry, mavis. Max... Are those the hats? Yes! Ah! Thank goodness. The famous hats have finally showed up. Mavis: (Clapping) Okay, everybody... Tonight we are going to go through the number with the straw hats. Well, will you be requiring some sort of introduction or shall I make do with a starting pistol? Ta-da! Oh, mavis, I... That's not a straw hat! Maxine: No kidding! I thought you were bringing the straw hats. So did I and look what they gave me. Oh, my god! I think that's rather me. Didn't you check them? I asked for straw hats. I expect the man to give me straw hats. What are we doing, the music man? You should have checked, Maxine. Should? What's this word "should?" Here's one. Do you like it? Thanks. Thank you, Maxine. Mavis: Rose... You're kidding! They'll be all right to practice with, won't they, mavis? No. But they'll just have to do, won't they? Here. Maxine: Mavis, next week, I guarantee it. I am so sorry. Truly I'm sorry. Change the record, will you? Mavis: It's all right, Max, I should have done it myself. Maxine: (Stuttering) Mavis, please... Max! I should have checked them... There's one missing! Oh! I don't believe it! I don't have a hat, mavis! Well, you'll just have to mime it, Dorothy. Well, I've been miming it all month. Well, then you should be really good at it, right? (Sneezing) Oh, god! Mavis, please, just... Oh, for heaven's sake! Thank you, Mrs. Fraser. Thank you. (All laughing) Five, six, seven, eight! (Upbeat music playing) All: One, two three, four, five, six, seven, eight. All: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two... Ouch! ...six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six... (Clamoring) (Arguing) God, we were terrible tonight, and I mean terrible! We were trying. (Sighs) Would you look at that Sylvia? (Laughing) Yeah, well, I'll think about it. Thanks for the beers. Are you at it again? I'm playing them along. Doesn't your husband mind? What, you mean me having a night out? Yes, you are married. Thursday's my night out. I go out, he babysits. He'd mind if he thought you were talking to him. Sylvia: He knows, right. You talk to him about it? I don't talk to him about it. I tell him. (Laughs) Take a pill, Dorothy. He loves it. That's why I do it. (Laughing) I mean, if he really believed me, he'd kill me, right? Right, yes. What he enjoys is the idea of being jealous. Take my word for it, it works wonders for your sex life. We used to do it more before we were married. I mean, come on, you do, right? Right, yes. A friend of mine was married for 10 years, and every day her husband wanted sex, not once but three times. Three times a day, for 10 years. Well, in the end she had to divorce him. Over-consummation of marital rights. (Sylvia laughing) Hell, I'm not surprised. That man is sick. Where's he living now? (Squealing) So, seven, eight and one, and two, and three, and four, and five... Wait for the music, lynne. And seven, go, Max... And eight, Sylvia, good... And nine... Everybody, everybody. When you use a cane, it's got to be clean and precise but mostly it's got to be together. Now, that takes time, you guys, and if there's one thing we don't have, it's time. This is not your fault, this is my fault. So, I've made a decision, I'm cutting the canes. (Speaking indistinctly) Give the canes to me, please. Give your canes to me. Believe me, it will be better. Thank you, mavis. All right? Mavis: Just trust me on this one, will you, please? The canes are out of the number, the hats are in. Everybody, the double line. Okay, Andy, you're right down here. Maxine, change places with lynne. (Sneezing) Can't you do something about that, Dorothy? Sorry, mavis, it's the pollen. All right, do this with your right foot... Brush, pull. Right. Now, with your left foot. (Blowing nose) There's got to be a spray or there's got to be something. Now, if you can do that together. I will put it in the number at this point. Both feet together at the same time? Yeah. Just practice it, see if you can get it. Can I say something, mavis? Yes, lynne. We were all wondering if, when we do this bit that... Well, if we might be able to do something different. I know how important it is that we're a team and everything, but we just thought that this might be the moment when we all might be able to do something... Individual. You mean, kinda like a solo? A solo, yes. Only if you think it's a good idea though. Well, what do you have in mind? (All speaking indistinctly) Shut up! Just shut up! Evidently you all feel that there's something missing in this number. I mean, you think you're capable of doing something that I don't know you can do? If you don't think I know what you can do just show me something else, all right, just show me. You work it out on your own. You have two counts of eight, by yourselves. Just show me, that's all. I mean, you teach me because I'm tired of being the teacher. You have five minutes. I hope you're all very proud of yourselves. I shouldn't have said anything. No, no, no, it's not your fault. I don't know what happened. I don't know what I'm doing. I mean, this is crazy, glenda. This is gonna be terrible. (Sighs) (Sobbing) Reading between the lines, I think they have a hard time. Money. Have you seen her shoes? Have you? Yes. Always wears the same shoes, always. (Gasps) Well, she can't make much, that's for sure, especially having to rent the room. Mmm-hmm. And pay Mrs. Fraser. (Sneezing) That doesn't help, either. I'm sorry, it's the... All: Pollen! In December? (Blowing nose) Oh, no. Thank you. Okay, what you got? All right... Look, I know that you know how to do a lot of things but you don't know how to do this. I do. I know how to, and I am trying to highlight all of you in this. But we've got to work together, you guys. If we're not a team out there, it's gonna be a disaster. Here's what I need, all right? I need you to listen to me, I need you to trust me and I need you to do what I tell you to do. I also need to say, just once, that I apologize, I'm sorry, I lost my temper and it won't happen again. No, mavis we should apologize to you. We were out of line. (All speaking) We're very, very sorry. (Speaking indistinctly) We understand, mavis. No, you don't understand. You don't understand. I am pregnant and I don't want to be. Now, can you understand that? Can you understand that? Okay... You know what I wanna do? I want to take it from where the melody of happy feet comes in. You know, the scissors, right? But not in the mirror, all right? Not gonna have mirrors on stage, so better get used to it. Positions, everybody. Come on, come on. Okay, glenda. And five, six, seven, eight. (Piano music playing) (Mavis vocalizing) Smile. (Mavis vocalizing) That's it. Come on. Come on. Smile! Yeah, we're a team. (Vocalizing) Good. (Vocalizing) This is the big time, you guys. Hit it. Why didn't you tell me this before? Because I knew you'd try to talk me out of it. You're a beautiful and gifted lady. I'm trying to keep you from wasting your life. I'm not wasting my life. We're making a big career move to L.A. There's nothing here for you. It's a cultural wasteland with dirty snow. Yeah, and in six months you'll be bitching about L.A. And the fact that the freeway is crowded and it never rains. That's bullshit, mavis. Patrick, for god's sake, I'm starting to make a life for myself here. I'm making friends. In seven years, you're the only person I've had a chance to get close to. It's that damn class, isn't it? You know, I didn't spend all this time with you just so you can throw it all away on a bunch of lousy amateurs. I don't know what you're talking about... I know what a professional is, all right? A professional is somebody who's there, who shows up! A professional is somebody who you can ask a question to and maybe they'll answer because they know a little bit more than you do. A professional is somebody who takes responsibility when you need them! Patrick, with them I am a professional! With you I'm an amateur. Don't lecture me about responsibility! Having a kid wasn't in our deal. It is now. Not for me. Well, that's your decision. But our child is in my body. And whether it stays there or not, that's my decision. Patrick, I love you very, very much. But I'm not going with you. I look like a dancer. You are a dancer. You're right, I am a dancer. Mavis. Mavis: Yes. What I was going to do... Yeah? Oh, that's perfect, Rose. I was going to try and make them all the same length. Now, see, go down, Geoffrey, darling. Thank you. That's it. All the bottoms line up. Do you see? Hmm. It would be ever so effective. It would be a lot more effective if our bottoms lined up! (Chuckling) Well, they don't, so... Vera, that's a really good idea, but I don't think, you know... (Stammers) No? No. Oh! How many? Nine. You're bringing your whole bus tour? My colleagues from the library, they're really looking forward to it. Are you sure you want them to come? (Laughing) Yes. Nine. How many? Two... please. It's cash. Can I pay you next week? Yes. Thanks. Mavis: Everybody, listen to me. We only get the stage of the theater the day of the benefit, the dress rehearsal that's it, okay. That's only two more rehearsals. Don't say it. Just thinking about it turns my stomach. I must remember to get my hair done. Have you ordered any tickets? No, there really isn't anyone I... Not that I'm sorry. What about you? Oh, no. To tell you the truth I haven't told anybody... Well, it's gonna be hard enough without... (Whispering) Listen, do you wanna have a party after the show? Oh, great idea! You guys, do you wanna have a party after the show? All: Yes! We could do it here. (Speaking indistinctly) Maxine: Scene of the crime. (Laughs) My husband won't be here that weekend. He has to be away on business. And I was just wondering if, um, maybe instead of a party, you'd like to come over for a meal or something? You know, I could cook... I mean, only if you want to. I'm not trying to... Andy? Um, well... I did sort of vaguely promise someone that I would... Well, we'll miss you. Uh, Geoffrey? Well, I... I don't, uh... Oh, come on, you're the only guy. Well, it sounds good. Yes, I would like to come. Thank you, Maxine. (Women continue talking) Huh. So... I made you some coffee. You know where I'll be. You'll let me know how, when... Sure. Sure, I will. You wanna beat the traffic. (Engine starting) Do you need me to take you to the airport? Yes, thank you. It's at 10:00, right? It was but it's been changed, Ann. I'm leaving this evening, 8:30. I can't take you this evening, frank. Oh. Why is that, Ann? I have one of my classes. Then you'll have to miss one of your classes. I can't. What do you mean, you can't? It's one of my classes, it's, um... It's a dancing... A dancing class. And we're putting on a show. It's, um, sort of a benefit and I'm supposed to be in it. (Scoffs) Dancing classes? Yes. And how long have you been going to these dancing classes? For about six months now. And you never thought to tell me? I thought that you wouldn't approve. I see. All right... Show me. What? You're taking dancing lessons, you're in some sort of show... Show me. (Tapping) Go on, go on, go on. (Tapping) (Frank laughing) You won't be doing any show. Frank... No, listen to me! You won't be doing any show because you'll look ridiculous. And more to the point, you'll make me look ridiculous. Rose: He says, "honey, there's no reason for you to be worried. "You move like an angel." (Scoffs) Sure, I move like an angel. I've been moving like an angel for the past half hour to the toilet. The thing is it's not just my stomach that's turned to water, it's my whole body. Sylvia, are you listening to what I'm saying? What? What? Would you stop flirting with these guys? Sylvia: What, Rose? I'm not doing anything wrong. Rose: You're driving me crazy. (Sylvia laughing) I'm just having a little bit of fun. Sure, fun, right. He was cute, wasn't he? Yeah, right, fun. (Both screaming) Watch out! (Tires screeching) No conversation, baby, you're gonna pay! Mom! (Sighs) (Dramatic music playing) Mavis: (Whispers) Hi, girls. Both: Hi. Hi, Pam. Hi. Good? Good. Wait until you see the a team. They haven't seen nothing yet. Yeah. Okay, you guys, are we all here? Everybody is, except Andy. Andy? I wonder where she could be. Wow! Wow, fabbo! Oh, my god! Oh! I forgot my shoes. You can't rehearse without your shoes. You think maybe someone will have mine? Oh, hello, Rose. Mavis: Everybody... Okay, just a second, let me talk to the lighting guy. Hello. Hello. Mavis Turner tappers. Uh, can you show me what you got on this front pipe? You got it, babe. Mavis: You got any specials? Man: Yeah. Mavis: Can I use them? Man: No, they're all set for miss leichner. Uh, well, look, just light US so you can see US. Okay, everybody. Here we go. Opening positions. Oh, sorry, Max. Now, yeah, here... Hats up. All right. Just back up, just a little bit. (Curtains raising) It's so clean! (Chuckles) Don't panic. Hey, mister, can we have these? Can we have these? Ah! Great! I love you! Excuse me. I'm really starting to worry about Andy, now, she's still not here. Didn't she say anything to anybody? All right, look, don't worry, uh... Let me go see if I can find out what's happening. Go through the spacing, huh? Thank you. (Speaking indistinctly) Problems? No problems. It's not like Andy to be late. No, but life's always a bit of a drama for poor Andy. Why do you always say things like that? She's... She's what? It doesn't matter. Could you break in and see if there's anybody talking on that line? It is off the hook. Thank you. Okay, let me see you on your opening marks again. Everybody, please, you are still looking at the floor. All of US? All of you. I mean, uh, they wanna see your faces, not your roots, you know. And, you know, if you look like you're having a good time, the audience will have a good time. The three t's. Mavis: Yes! Mavis? Mavis: Yes, Vera? You wanted to change something. Change? What do you mean? Mavis: Don't panic, everybody. It's one thing and it's good luck to change something the opening night. Watch, it's easy. Here we go. We go one, two and go on three instead of four. Three, four, five, six, seven. See? Let's try it. And... All: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Mavis... Mavis: Yes? What happens if somebody drops their hat? Mavis: Well, nobody's gonna drop their hat. But if you do drop your hat, you just keep going. For god's sake keep going. Don't stop for anything. Keep moving. Yes. Yes, I thought so. What you mean is if I drop my hat. No, Andy, I think she means if anybody drops their hats. No, no. You mean me. That's what you meant, isn't it, Vera? Andy, don't be so touchy. I didn't ask your opinion, thank you. Rose: Come on, come on. Yeah, come on. Let's try it again. Just once more, here we go. Okay, one, two, three, four... I'm sorry, mavis, but I really wanna have this thing out. Okay, Andy. So, what's the problem? I know exactly what you're thinking. All of you. You don't think that I should be in it. You think that I'm gonna be letting you all down. You're very good, Andy. (All speaking indistinctly) Please, I am not good. Mavis: Andy... I don't know why I'm here. I don't know what I'm doing. I mean, I... I can't do it. I can't do the steps. But that's what we all admire about you. Mavis: Vera... The way you try so hard. Vera, I'll handle this. Just trying to be helpful. I don't want you to be helpful. I'm sick to death of you trying to be helpful all the time. You're so stupid! Andy, take it easy. You were just the same at the last class you went to. You didn't leave because you didn't like the teacher. You left because they asked you to leave because they couldn't stand you interfering all the time. Well, I'm sick of you. I'm sick of this. I'm sick of all of it. Oh, god! That's not true, actually. I left because I wanted to. It's all right, Vera... All: It's all right. May I take it that the rehearsal is concluded? Geoffrey... You remember when Andy sprained her wrist? I saw her at the hospital and I saw her file when it came down from X-ray. Geoffrey, please, listen to me. They've been talking about her at the hospital. They don't think that she just fell down. Apparently she's been there before. They think it's her husband. They think she gets beaten up. So, how many you got coming, Vera? What? Oh, sorry, uh, just my husband and my daughter, actually. Hmm. That's nice. Rose: She's just like you. She does look like me, doesn't she? She's not Lionel's daughter. He adopted her. I was married before, in england. I was very young. It didn't last. He was such a gentleman, Lionel. Well, he still is. You can see. It was him who taught me everything. About dress, and everything. He said "I don't want to be ashamed of you, do I?" He says some terrible things sometimes. But it's just his sense of humor. You know, very dry. But he thinks the world of my daughter. My Louise. She's 17. He says she looks almost exactly like I did when he first met me. They're never apart. They go everywhere together. Theaters, concerts... Everywhere. I mean, I don't mind. I've got plenty to do. And anyway I like making a nice home for them, you know. Then they tend to talk about things I don't really understand. I'm sorry I messed up your practice, mavis. I just couldn't help it. I mean, this means a lot to me and I just... Flipped! (Exhales) Well, at least you didn't throw up. What? Oh, I threw up before every opening night I've ever had. It was awful. (Chuckles) She just makes me so mad. I thought you were terrific. I was proud of you. God, it feels good to fight back, doesn't it? (Chuckles) Yeah, it really does. You drop that hat, I will kill you. (Both chuckle) I won't. I know. I won't. (Bell jingling) Oh, look. Oh, wow! That looks fantastic. (Knocking on door) Oh, Max. Max. Uh, flowers for the mavis Turner tappers. Oh! Really? You guys, they're from mavis. Thank you. Oh, wow! Oh, here. Show business, I love it. (Orchestral music playing) Shh, you guys. You guys, listen. Listen. Man: Overture and places, please. I'm here to see my wife. Um, you can't go back there just now... That's not my problem, old man. Hey, hey, hey, just a minute... I don't give a damn about your show. My name is pennington and I wanna see my wife now! Mr. Pennington? You're Andy's husband, is that right? I take it you're one of her associates. Yes, I am. If you wanna see your wife, you can see her later. Right now, I suggest you do the civilized thing and leave her in peace. Do you have any idea who you're talking to? Oh, yes. And I know what you do. (Chuckles) (Groans) (Audience applauding) (Sighing) Aren't they an inspiration? Yeah. All set? Yeah, all set. Ready to go? Yeah. Good. Good. Hi! Okay, you ready? (All mumbling) Right. Okay, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Come on, come on. Come on. Here we go. (Breathing heavily) Mavis: Vera! All right. Okay, everybody listen to me. Uh, lynne, whatever you do, remember, don't be late on that pick-up. Okay. Dorothy, watch your arms. Arms, yes. Rose, don't hop. Listen to me, everybody, all you have to do is concentrate. And remember you're better than anybody in this building. I'm so proud of you. Just remember the three t's. I forgot the three t's. What are the three t's? (Sneezing) Maxine, I got something to tell you. Alan already told me. Don't worry about it. I love you, honey. Man: Thirty seconds, everybody. And you too, sweetheart. Mavis: Okay, everybody, opening positions, please. Nice and easy, here we go. Everybody, take... Vera! Vera! Vera! Vera! Come here! Come here! Okay... Good luck, Vera! Thank you. Okay...
