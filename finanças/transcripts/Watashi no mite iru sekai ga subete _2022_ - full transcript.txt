I can no longer remember what I was trying to accomplish. Lonely Glory Can you tell me about all you can about your current situation? Can you tell me about all you can about your current situation? Please take your time. Okay. Well... I'm a bit stressed out, and I have no appetite, and I haven't gone to work for about a week. I... I see. They just unsympathetically told me to get a medical certificate. I'm starting to wonder why I worked so hard all this time. That sounds very difficult. In the end, my boss only cared about results. He didn't care how hard I worked. That's what makes it unbearable. I sympathize with you. But I'm sure there are people who see how hard you work. You should talk with these people... Okay, that's enough. First of all, it's rude to refer to your client by their first name in your first session. Also, I don't think assuming people sees her hard work accomplishes anything. The basic principle of counseling is to help clients see their problems, correct? Convenience of mental care we provide during a spare moment is the unique selling point of our service, so if you can't immediately see what our clients are concerned about, what they're seeking... Then honestly... I think you're not suited for this job. Maybe you're right. Don't tell me I'm right. I want to hear exactly how you intend to improve. Uh, can you hear me? Oh, I can hear you. In America, for example, counseling is far more commonplace. They also have much more preventive stance to medical treatments. So I thought maybe we shouldn't fix our mental problems only after they happen. When I was in college, I thought there should be a subscription service where we regularly take care of our mental state. You were a student when you had this idea? Yes, I briefly mentioned the idea to our Ando, our CEO, when I was an intern. He told me to write a business plan, and I eventually became the project leader. So he saw the potential in you. Although, I was was thinking, I'm just a student without any business experience. Still, to grow a business to such scale in just two years is an incredible feat. Of course, I couldn't have done it alone. I made it this far... largely thanks to Morioka, who's standing over there. Right? No, not at all. He handles almost everything related to app development. I see. Sorry, please place it a little closer to your face. My secret to success: Trust my colleagues and trust myself Trust One Inc. Haruka Kumano I will contact you all again for the next meeting. Thank you everyone. Thank you! See you. Kumano. Do you have a minute? Yes. I have an online meeting at 10. There's a claim of workplace bullying from you. It's from Kimura, right? Something that comes to mind? His customer satisfaction rating was low, so I simply gave him instructions. Aren't we being too sensitive if that's workplace bullying? I checked the recording of your call. You attacked his character, and pressured him to quit. Also your overbearing attitude. It's absolutely unacceptable for a manager. He still hasn't reached his target for this quarter. Should we keep someone who can't do his job? Isn't it absurd that a counseling service manager is being accused of workplace bullying? You haven't answered my question. Ando, you always said we need to get rid of people who aren't useful! This is the second time. Huh? Who else is there? I want to speak with this person. He's no longer with us. Please tell me. I appreciate all your contributions, from when you were still a student. But now, I have to protect this organization. Things are different now. Are you telling me to quit? Changing your behavior isn't an option? No. I don't see any room for growth here. Should've told me she was coming. I didn't call her. She didn't show up for Dad. I didn't think she'd come. Yes, I can hear you. Yes. The hospital's funeral service was too expensive. Yes, I'm looking at it now. The cheapest plan will do. Yes. Yes, good-bye. I took care of everything. Eldest son will represent the family. Right, got it. What about the opening remarks? I think it can be same as the last time. Fujiko Kumano passed away on 8/5 (Thu). We will be temporary closed for few days. I have an idea. Let's sell this house. You can't be serious. Even after inheritance tax and demolition costs, it'll be a pretty big amount. I'm sure it will be, but... Don't decide for us. Business isn't getting any better, right? I can't lose my place to live. Takuji, did you intend to leech off our parents for rest of your life? What about you? I don't think we should be obligated to keep the shop open. I knew the day would come. You might as well quit now if that's what you think. Mom must be rolling in her grave. Can you balance our ledger once, then talk? As Haruka said, our sales has been falling for the past few years. I'm not agreeing with her for no reason. But you still try to keep things running. That's what family business is all about! You rent out the second floor because there's not enough money, right? Your regulars must all be elderlies, too. Eventually, they won't be able to shop here. We don't need the opinion of someone who hasn't been here for the past 6 years. I'll go take a nap. Yeah, go be a shut-in. Let's talk about this some other time. She doesn't care because she already left once. She has the right to leave if that's what she wants. As the eldest son, I have a duty to keep family business running. That's so old-fashioned. No one asked you. What kind of people sell their parents' legacy for money? There's no way I'm selling this place. How did you live with them for all these years? You still bitter about it? I left so that I don't have to. You should've at least attended Dad's funeral! You're so ungrateful. I showed up for Mom's funeral. What's the point of showing up after she's dead? There was nothing to talk about when she was alive. Are you serious about that farm girl at the funeral? She's about my age, right? What do you mean by serious? Like getting married. Her father has a bad back. She can't leave the farm. Farming is pretty good. Better than this shop. Why don't you go there? You're just trying to get rid of me. What's more important, this house or her? Welcome home. Was Shigeta all right? Yeah, he could barely walk, though. Thanks for picking him up on such a short notice. You're not having a beer? No, I won't stay tonight. Please stay. You prepared your own beer! We may end up selling this house. I see. What will you do after that? I have no idea. Wanna come to my place? It's small though. I guess. I'm sleeping here tonight. How come? Well, my room's gone. What do you do for a living? Looking for a job after graduation. When did you graduate from college? 4 years ago. Then you're just unemployed. Any part-time work? Not doing any. Why don't you try this? You don't need a lot of capital for this, I think it's perfect for someone who can't communicate. Just so you know, there's no one to leech off anymore. Why are you following me? I want to meet her. Also, I get along well with older generations. My condolences for your loss. I appreciate your visit during such a difficult time. I heard from my brother that he has marriage in mind. So I wanted to pay a visit in place of my mother. If you would like... Baked sweets from this shop is really good. Thank you very much. Marriage is in my mind. Or rather... I am very serious about this relationship. I was surprised when I first heard about your age, but I always tell her to hurry and get married if there is someone suitable. How can you keep this place running without me? If I sell the field, that would be enough to support myself. I won't quit even if I'm on my own. How can a woman do this alone? I'm better at it than you. What's your plan? I... uh... hope I can run both businesses. Have you thought this through? - Of course! - Have you thought this through? I would really appreciate it, but I can't let you work yourself to death. I'll give it a shot. Let's talk about this first. How about... my brother come help out every week? Huh? We won't know if he can handle both until he tries. Uh, yes. Please. Let's open it up. You shouldn't be the one to decide that! Let's open it. Okay, I'll... yeah... Wait, wait. Tasty. Was it always this delicious? What? (Mumbling continues) Here is your item. Thank you. Thank you very much. Ah! This is beyond repair. The motherboard... Uh, excuse me. Oh! Sorry I didn't see you. Do you have defective items? Yeah, we got some. Broken goods. are you sure? Yes. Okay, come this way. Keisuke is going to help out at Asuka's place. Oh, so we'll close the shop. Of course we'll continue! I may trouble you a bit with my absence, though. What happens if you can't handle both? I'm sure I can. If you say so. Can we close the udon shop? Whatever, I'll handle that, too! Don't make promises you can't keep. Welcome. Hi, welcome. Hi Kei, can I ask you to change our living room's lights when you deliver next time? What will you do after the shop closes? Probably live alone and work part-time. You're the only one living in reality. Don't worry about me. Convince the two of them by yourself. I think you're being way too selfish. Thank you. Sure, take your time. Don't bother repairing these ones that are missing the casing. Just get rid of them. Don't waste your time. There are businesses that sell a lot of remote controllers on Yahoo Auction. It's usually businesses that sell them in bulk. If you contact them directly, then as you can see... Hey... Is the shop fine without you? Yeah, it's fine. It's great to be out in the nature. Do you really think you can handle both? I already made up my mind. What do you mean by that? It means I can handle both. Don't push yourself too hard. What are you trying to say? It's not that easy. You're all exhausted. Miwako! They'll just have a look around here. I think this part was built at a later date. By the way, have you already decided on selling date? I'm done, Rika! Thank you! I know you're really busy. Sorry it took so long. I don't mind. I'll get rid of these. Thank you. All right, see you around! Have a safe trip home. These, please. Oh, wow! What are you going to do with all these defective items? I fix them, then sell online. Oh, you sell in those auctions? Well? Is it profitable? I just started, so not really. Is that right? Still, that's very impressive. I'll double your pay. I'm also considering commissions. No better way of showing my appreciation than compensation. I appreciate it. Kentaro, I knew you would follow my lead. I wouldn't be here today without you. Well, I wish you consulted with me in advance. These things are all about speed. Top management needs to be decisive, right? That's a good point. Anyway, Our schedule will be pretty tight if our plan is to launch within this year. I'm sure the two of us can manage. Can act as if you're leading the charge? Yes, ma'am. Also, um... I'm waiting for the right time to resign, but how's the financing... Oh, don't worry. We'll be selling the house, so there will be some funds. I'll be able to survive without a fixed salary. What? You're not selling because of this, right? Both of my parents passed away. I think it's the right time to sell. Oh, I see. Were you the only child? I have 3 siblings who are detached from reality. No one else really knows anything about inheritance. Honestly, I have to focus more energy on that side. I see. In that case, I'll try to handle everything that I can. Thank you, you're a lifesaver. Wanna have a drink? It's middle of the day. Oh, come on! Let's celebrate your resignation. Thank you. What do you want? Why didn't you return my calls? I'm not talking to a real estate agent. Uh, you smell! I'm dropping by at the field too. Aren't you just making it harder for them by randomly showing up? Good evening. Hello. I'm Tsukasa Miyamoto. We've met at the funeral. Oh, nice to see you again. Get your own bowl if you want to eat. Okay, I'll have some. Where's Takuji? Probably jerking off. Don't say that! Takuji has been visiting my shop a lot lately. I saw him carrying piles of junk. Right. Looks like he's fixing defective items and selling them online. Is he really capable? Looks like he's working hard. Beats being a shut in. It means he's becoming more independent. The real estate agent must have had a hand in this. You're not being cooperative at all. We're not selling this place. Um... May a have a moment of your time? What is it? Uh... happy birthday, Miwako. Thanks. Oh right. Congrats. Um... I got you this. Really? This is a pleasant surprise. Thank you. Congratulations. Enough with the act. Well... I really wondered if this is the right time, but... Uh... Miwako... Why? Uh, well... I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Did you know about this? No. A surprise for the whole family. They really didn't know about this. Good for you, Miwako. I thought you knew better. Sorry for making you see all that. Don't worry. I wonder if things would've went better if I said it after the meal. Are you being serious? That was a joke. Do you joke a lot? As much as the next person. Tell me, why do you want to marry my sister? If the house is gone, I thought that may be the end of our relationship. I think it's all in your mind. I sure hope so. Well... Do you know that thing about my sister? yes. I know everything. I don't have a kid, but I'm also divorced. Do you have to be married to be together? I don't think so, but... I hoped it would make things easier for her. She came back about the time when I left. So... it's been 5 or 6 years. Still, some wounds can't be healed by time. But you can't change the past. You're right about that. Sorry. I'll go home after a few drinks. I'll pick up the truck tomorrow. Sure, but... you're not breaking up with her, right? Say hi to everyone for me. You're kidding me, right? It's been so long since I last drank so much. I have a headache. My body can't handle it like those alcoholics. I'm not helping you with anything. Also, I'm not turning the lights off. Oh, you're giving it a shot. As you can see. How's the profit? How much are you making on an hourly basis? Anyway, you should raise your price. You'll get more revenue. And I doubt you can make a living with just this. Hey, don't touch that! Man, go kill yourself. I'll buy that. You're despicable. Your breakfast is still here. Oh, thanks. Hey, about yesterday... I think I'll keep working here. Huh? Why? We're selling because we can't keep the business running, right? It'll last few more years. We'll think about it then. What's the point in delaying? We already have customers here. Is this about Mami? That's ridiculous. I don't think Mami has anything to do with you getting married again. You don't deserve to be happy after you get divorced? How many years has it been? What about you? You haven't changed in all these years. I've seen all kinds of things out there. I'm fine with being alone for rest of my life. You're the same as me, aren't you? What are you trying to say? I'm just worried about you. Then leave me alone. Excuse me. Yes? May I ask you about your current profit? This is a bit embarrassing, but only about 30,000 yen. You're very talented if you can make that much at this stage. Really? Is that how it is? Tell me, how much do you want to make? Well... I'm hoping eventually about 300k. I see. In the end, this industry is all about the accumulation of hard work over time. Mr. Kumano, are you serious about making money? Yes, of course. Okay. If you buy our Auction Know-how Guidebook, you also get unlimited one-to-one support for 6 months. What do you say? Well, you're very talented, so I'm sure you can do it all on your own, but I really recommend it if you want to quickly make 300k. I can get that, too? Everything all right behind you? I can get that, too? Is that a seminar? You've gotta be kidding me. Those are usually scams. Are you kidding? - Hey, listen. - Are you kidding? Do you know the kanji for Takumi, the guy who divorced Miwako. That's all I want to know. Taku, as in Kaitaku, and mi, as in Umi. Happy? Thanks. Hello? My name is Kumano. Yes. May I speak with Takumi Yamashita? Yes. Thank you. I'm making a delivery. Watch the shop. Okay. Welcome. In Preparation Noodle will get soft. He might get remarried. My dad. I see. It doesn't concern you, right? That's not true. Although, it's up to your father. Why did you get divorced? You came all this way to ask that? You're the one who contacted us, right? What? I'm so confused. I'm sorry. I'm... so sorry for everything. It's too late for apologies. It's delicious. Right. It'll rain later. Don't worry. I have a folding umbrella. I see. Watch out for cars. Thank you for having me. Take care of yourself. Okay. Bye. See you. Hey... I'm sorry. Would it have been better if you didn't see her? I didn't wait for you for dinner. Sorry. What's with the scary look? I think I'll leave here... and live with Tsukasa. I'm not your parent. I can't tell you what to do. What about the udon shop? I'll have to close it. I'll hire a part-timer. Where will you get the money for that? Stop being so stubborn. Takuji, you can be an udon shop owner. No, thanks. You guys can do as you like. Hey. Do I still have allowance savings? I think there was about 300,000. What will you use it for? For work. I'll make a living on my own and leave. I wouldn't do that. It's too suspicious. Are you sure? Don't waste it. Mom saved that money for you. I don't need a freelancer who shows up when she feel like it, and someone who got knocked up and came crawling back telling me what to do. You don't have to work hard to look good, unlike me. He's right for once. Use it at your own risk. I tried to stop him! It's your own responsibility. Thanks. This is for the ice cream. Bye. Hello. I'm calling regarding the venture capital financing that we discussed few days ago. Unfortunately, we are unable to fulfill your requests after a thorough evaluation. I'm sorry. Please come in. Watch your step. Please call me when you are done. Yes, thank you. Take your time. Isn't this place a bit too big? It'll be packed in no time. You're so confident. The HR industry will definitely keep growing. I'll take the company public in 5 years. This is so exciting. We'll get rid of anyone who isn't useful. That's how we've always worked, right? Otherwise, it's not worth doing. Don't you agree, Kentaro? Yes. I'll work as if my life depended on it. By the way, are we okay with the deposit? We've been getting urgent inquiries. I have the money covered. Focus on your work. I'm sorry, I understand. Did you make this? I learned it as I went. Wow, you're really good. What do you want? I'm looking for something. I'm sorry for the last time. I'm Tsubokawa. Oh, you were on Zoom. It was nice seeing you over the screen. Oh, thanks. She's my sister. Oh, you're based in Tachikawa. By the way, are you registered as a business? We're still under a trade name, but we intend to incorporate next year. What's your business scope? Our service provides auction know-how, and we also provide purchase-related information. That's trending now. Would you be interested? Oh, I'm doing fine on my own. Right. Thanks for taking care of my brother. Sorry, she's a bit rude. Should we go out for lunch? Sounds good. What do you like to eat? Anything is fine. I like ramen. Ramen would be good. What? I can't hear you. The certificate of title. You must have seen it. I haven't. There must have been some paperwork when Dad passed away. I really don't know. I'll look for it, but we can't close this place down without convincing Keisuke. Go convince him first. Can you talk to him with me? He's angry at me. He says he's not talking to you anymore. What's his problem? Hey, do you have time to talk later? Hey, are you listening to me? I'm breaking up with Asuka. You'll get your precious shop. Huh?! What's going on? Tell me what happened. I'm sure it's my fault. And you just said "okay" and left? What else am I supposed to do? She said we're breaking up. Then will you kill yourself if she told you to? If she said it to me now, I might consider it. You're too old to be sulking like a child! You have to live and win her back! I feel tired just by looking at you! You're just giving up? I don't want to break up, but the whole marriage thing was too sudden. Huh?! It's your fault for worrying about the house instead of her! You won't meet a girl like that again. Give me a break. This house might be gone while you're asleep. What do you want from me? So... why did you break up with my brother? That's between the two of us. You should just tell him that you need him here. It's none of your business. You know he's indecisive, so that's the only way to marry him, right? Whatever. I have to work. What do you like about him, anyway? Mostly his looks. What?! No, wait, wait, what? I'm sorry, but honestly I don't like people like you. I can say the same thing to you. But my brother loves you. Can you not enter without permission? Is everything manual work? I'm sure you can automate some of it. Listen, you're really not welcome here. I need a quick chat with you. I need to finish my work. How long does that take? Can you be gentle? You'll damage the seedlings. You haven't taught me how to do it right. Keisuke was able to get a hang of it right away. In overseas, they use drones to spray pesticide. I told you, this is how you do it. Just the surface. Like this? Like this, this... Hello, welcome. You're with your daughter today. Welcome. Then you take that string. Move to the next spot. What? Right there. Make sure it's straight. That's right. Where was it again? The red line. Thank you for the delivery. Can I leave it at the back? Keep your arms straight and your head up. Keep your arms straight. I already am... Are you sure about that move? These are all cucumbers. Find one that's this big, and don't touch the spines. Grab the upper part and cut it from here. You can take it now. It's important to keep the spines. Potato and beef stir fry? Thank you so much. Twist the middle. Make sure it's tight. This is what you do everyday? Yeah. I'm surprised you can keep it up. I really like this job. I can't imagine doing this. What do you do for a living, Haruka? I'm running a business venture, I guess. It suits you. You're very persistent. You're pretty persistent yourself. Is your job fun? It's not really about fun. I have to succeed no matter what. What's success? People around you recognize that you're right. It's no fun unless you get recognition from others? Obviously, yes. You're only interested in yourself. What? Break's over. Sorry... I have a headache. Do you want to rest? Yeah... Sorry, looks like Haruka caused quite a stir today. Was she all right? She didn't seem all right at all. What about you? No. I wasn't all right at all. I felt like I really needed to see you again. I spoke to our regulars about the shop. Well? Wonderful! Right? It's a daiginjo grade sake. Wow, thank you so much! This is your last glass, okay? This is so... Good morning sunshine. Just come over here. Come join us! Glass! Where is it? I'll go get one. We'll be fine from here. No, we'll walk you out. Have a safe trip home. Once again, I'm so sorry. Don't worry. Let's drink again. See you again. Good-bye. I didn't know you had driver's license. It's going to be a wild run. I'll take a taxi home. Don't worry! You're used to driving now? I can't make any promises. Thanks, guys. I'll move here. Are you serious? Yeah. Does Asuka know? I told her earlier. Are you sure about this? It's what you wanted. No. You're not much of a real estate agent. What are you doing? You start the car navigation system. It's right here. I'm getting scared. Relax, it'll be fine. Yeah. You're pushing too many things. Just the right turn signal. You've improved a lot. I couldn't reach him for the past two days. Let's talk inside. Ando, did you stop him or say something? Kentaro chose to quit here and work with me! He told me in person about his resignation. I don't intend to stop him either. Then why can't I reach him? That's what I want to know. His paperworks here is still incomplete. I don't understand what's going on.. I knew you took good care of him. And I thought he trusted you. "I don't care if it was poaching." "You have my support," was what I told him. Then there's no issue, right? Does that mean it's my fault? Perhaps. But only he knows the truth. Notice of store closing Food Center Hiyoshi will close as of 9/15/2021 (Wed). Thank you for your patronage for all these years and remaining days. Leave some for Takuji, okay? There's no meat for anyone who leaves without telling us. Movers are coming this weekend. All right. I got a desk job, so I'll start moving stuff out with Tsukasa. Okay. We have to start packing. What happened to you? Do we get the money for this place soon? Huh? Of course not! We're moving things along, but it'll take months. I see. Wait, wait, wait! Who did this to you? No one. Fighting is a crime when you're an adult. Shut up. Just sit down! We won't be mad. We should be at least a little mad. Keep your mouth shut. I was scammed. Happy now? I told you so. I'm glad things went your way. You made a bad judgment. Nothing more, nothing less. I'm sorry for being a loser who doesn't deserve to live. Just remember it costs us when you die. It's all because of your meddling. The weak always blame everything on others. Haruka! Don't you have any self-respect?! Think about how to get back at them, if you have time to complain. This would've never happened if you didn't try to sell the house. Let's just cut to the chase. It's just 300,000 yen, right? I'll give it to you as investment. Haruka... How can you be so inconsiderate about other people's feelings? How cares about the money? Takuji, go get changed. Why? Miwako, please drive. What? You can go home. Exactly 300k here. Takuji was the one who started the fight. I'll pay for the clothes that were ripped. How much is it? Aren't you embarrassed for selling such useless information? You just ripped it off from some website. That's not how I see it. You didn't respond to any of my calls. You're not my only client. There are times when our response is delayed. I've explained this in advance. Do you know how much this money means to us? I see. I don't know why you came back with your family members, but they all looked down on you. That's what you told me, right? Anyway, please use that money to gain independence. You're a fully grown adult. Were you scamming him from the start? As I have already explained, I didn't scam him. Should I read the contract for you? I have to warn you, this is being recorded. Don't bother! If you don't make a stand now, you'll never be able to. Do we need another fight? Keep it. I'll make it on my own. Get out of my way. Let's go, Haruka. It must be difficult being around them. What are you... What are you feeling now? I feel like... it's such a hassle! Why did you come here? No reason. Don't tell me it's my responsibility. I won't. Everybody knows that. We're all leaving this place, aren't we? Thanks to you. Did you get kicked out? No. I thought you quit smoking. I did. I hate to admit, but... I'm thankful to you for the outcome. We recommend the tiramisu. I'll take two. Thank you. The number you called is currently unavailable. Please leave your name and message after the beep. Hello, this is Kumano. Uh... Don't worry about the business venture. I hope you can call me when you're feeling better. I'm just worried about your health. Excuse me. Huh? Where's the guy who's always here? Sorry, the shop closed down. Oh, I see. I'm sorry. Say hi to your family for me. Wait! Even now I have yet to find the right words.
