Sir! You cannot enter here! Can you leave? Ah, now. Please close your mouth. How did it go? Was he waiting for you? Yes, everything is fine. We had a small talk. And did he prescribe you something? No, he gave me something. And even said that the medicine I'm taking is good. Mom, I'll be back home around 8 PM, alright? Alright. And how is it? Let's take a look. You can't feel anything, right? [screams] Are you feeling sick? Maybe I could help you somehow? No... Thank you. Because, if you're feeling sick, maybe I can... Maybe you should take a seat? Does anything hurt you? - No, it will pass in a moment. Thank you. But no, please. It cannot be like that. If you're in pain, maybe I will call the nurse? Please wait, I will come in a second. Where are you going? Please wait. You can't leave. If you're in pain, something should be done about it. Thank you very much, sir. I will manage myself. Thank you. And will anyone come to pick you up? Please do not sit down. I will take you somewhere... Someone has left me here. But they will come? I had a procedure a moment ago, and someone simply has left me here. But in that case you should lie down. You cannot sit here on the stairs. I was lying down, though. Too long, so he left. But... Maybe he will come back soon? No. He won't come. Maybe I will help you? Please sit down on a chair. No... You cannot just sit here like that. I will get better in a bit and manage somehow. Thank you. But please, you can't... Please, maybe you can get up? We are disturbing others, here on the stairs. Maybe we can find some chairs? No, Thank you. I... Please, please. I cannot leave you in such condition. I will escort you. Please ma'am. That person won't come back. He paid, and... But you can't think such bad things about people. Maybe he's buying some bread. Or he's stuck in a traffic jam. Please, sit down on a chair and wait. Alright? Please. Please, walk with me. Let's go. I forgot my purse. - I will bring it in a second. This one? Let's go. Is it very far? Maybe I can help you? Please, allow me. I'll try to open it up. There's another one. Maybe I can help you with something else? - Thank you very much, sir. For everything. Maybe... I can bring something from the pharmacy? Or do some shopping? Maybe I should call someone? Notify them that... You're not feeling well. You shouldn't be alone right now. Thank you very much, sir. I will help you, please enter. You can't be alone now. I can make you some tea, something to eat. You should lie down. Please, enter. Please, come in. Maybe you first. Why should I enter first? Please, come in. [sighs] Maybe you can lie down? I will clean it all up. Really, please lie down. I will take care of this. Hm? I will do it. I'm putting it in the sink. It has spilled. One more thing. What do you want? I thought that you needed some help. Why did you follow me around and not someone else? You had a procedure, so... I couldn't just have left you like that. What procedure? What procedure? You had an abortion. So what? Is it bad? You see, I don't have a right to judge you. But you believe that it's a bad thing, don't you? Yes, I believe it's a bad thing. How so? You just have taken away a life of another human. I think, you didn't have a right to do it. It's my own business. Maybe nobody wanted that child? No, it's not just your own business. It wasn't just your business. After all it was a small human. Are you religious? Yes, I am religious. And what do you believe in? I believe, that life is sacred. And that it can't be aborted just like that. What? That you cannot take a life away from another human. It's sacred. What kind of nonsense are you talking? I believe that... What do you believe in? In God? And what is God? You see, if I tell you that... That God is love... - But do you really believe in that? You can't see what is happening all around you? Don't you analyze all of it? And you still believe in that? That he exists, that it's a good God? That he wants things to be this way? For people to live like that? Do you really believe in that? You see, all of what's happening has a purpose. I told you. It does not have a rational explanation. It has to be accepted, believed in. That it's the way it should be. Every human has a conscience, freedom of choice. And it's just a matter of how they decide to live their lives. You've lost your mind. But why do you think that I have lost my mind? I believe in that. Dear Jesus. Why are you crying? Please don't cry. Here you go. Do you feel a bit better now? I apologize, I just... I'm in some trouble, I have to move out tomorrow. I don't know what's happening with me. So you don't have a place to live? What about your family, friends? I don't have any. Neither mother, nor father. I'm sorry. Haven't you got a cigarette, have you? No, I don't smoke. Damn it. - There on the table. I will bring. I apologize again, but I... - Don't worry, nothing's happened. It's a panic. Are you better now? Better. What's your name? Tomasz. Tomasz... Do you study? Yes. Geography at the university. - Oh dear. Is it a useless major? Boring rather than useless. Rather boring, yes. Brag a bit more and I will calm down. Do you have a girlfriend? I don't. No! Really? Really. - But why? It just so happened. There must be something wrong with you, how come? Does everybody need to have a girlfriend? Yes, everybody. Such a boring geographer I am, so... No girl is interested in me. This cigarette doesn't taste good. Maybe it's too strong. Maybe I will quit. It's high time. Oh dear. You're not feeling well? I don't know. I don't know what to do. Please, don't cry. I'll make you tea. No, I'll make it. Please lie down. Why should I lie down? Because you should rest. I'll make that tea. No, I'll make tea. I lied to you about the procedure, I didn't have any. I'm not feeling well, I don't know what to do with myself. I have no place to go. I lied to you. Why did you lie to me? God, I don't know. Bugger off. I go... the tea. So I will go now. What's happened? Nothing. I'll just leave already. Are you angry with me? No, why? Alright, just go. I would go too. What did he prescribe you? Who? That doctor. How is it called? Wait, I'll show it to you. Here. What ingredients does it have? What? You're not going to give it back? Please give it back to me. If you need, I'll give you a pill or two. I wouldn't want to leave everything with you. Please, give it back to me. You're joking around, right? Why are you threatening me? If you have some problems... They're kicking you out of the flat. You don't have a job, but... It all can be managed somehow. It doesn't mean the end of the world. There's a way out of every situation. Or maybe there's something else? You're not in a hurry to go somewhere? Not at all. Could you stay with me today? - Of course, but I need to make a call. Call whom? My mom. Are you stupid? Why? I need to call my mom. I promised I'd be home around 8 PM. So call. Alright. This phone doesn't work, there's no signal. It doesn't work, it was disconnected. I asked them to wait at least 4 days more, but that hag didn't want to do it. Why are you standing like that? I should call, but I don't know where to find a phone booth. Damn it! Get out of here! Now, enough of it! Get out! Hello? Mom? I can't hear you well. Yes. If you can hear me. I'll be back a bit later today. Hello? Hello! It's done, I can stay. Well, I'll be damned. Excuse me? I thought you wouldn't come. I apologize about the way I kicked you out. Don't worry about it. I apologize for that entire day. Damn it. I'm gonna get up, and fix you something. - Please, no. I'm not hungry. I have a bread roll. Would you like one? No, thank you. Come here. I think that you misunderstood my intentions. I came here to help you. You don't fancy me? No, why... Not bad.. And you came here only for me? To help me? For real? I didn't lie to you earlier, I can't be alone now. Do you understand that? Yes, I do. But can you understand that I happen to... Wake up at night. That I'm scared. I understand, that's why I'm here. But where will you sleep? On the armchair. Listen to me. Can I wake you up at night? Yes, no worries, I have trouble sleeping. Are you often behaving like this? And you don't want anything in return? No. Turn off the light. Did you go to the swimming pool? Won't you ask me where was I last night? Once you feel like it, you will tell me. Why should I ask? I feel like telling you. Yesterday, when I was leaving the hospital. I met a woman on the stairs. She was so beaten down that I came to her and asked what'd happened. She had some terrible problem. I thought that maybe I could help her somehow. I offered to walk her home. At first, she didn't want to, but later she accepted. Especially since it was quite close, she didn't even want to take a cab. So we went to her house. I didn't want to leave her there alone, because... She wasn't in the best state. At some kind of crossroads. So I had to stay. I was afraid that she would hurt herself. What's her name? I don't even know. I know nothing about her. It was not even her flat, I wouldn't even find out. If you want you can bring her to the hospital. I feel sorry for her. Everything has fallen apart for her and she can't get herself together. Good morning. Sorry to bother you, but maybe you happen to know what's happened to that lady? No, why? Haven't you seen her today? I'm afraid something could've happened out there. She was ill recently. No. You don't know. Do you have a balcony? Sure. Maybe I could enter and take a look through the window. Maybe I'll notice something. She wasn't feeling very well recently. Something could've happened. Please enter. Thank you very much. I can't see anything. Maybe I could try to cross over there. Be careful. What's happened? Nothing. So why did you go to the doctor? Are you feeling bad? No. But what's happened? Are you sick? No, I'm not. Leave me alone. - Wait, wait, wait. Where have you been all day? - Why do you care? Please tell me what's happened. Nothing's happened! Please, leave me alone. I was at your place looking for you. - What is it? Nothing. Please, leave me alone. Wait, you've moved out? Yes. Where will you live now? I don't know, please leave me alone. Where to? Wait, wait. Easy. Do you have a place to stay? - No. I'm very cold. My feet, hands are cold. So come to our place. We'll sit there, think what to do. Come on. We'll figure something out. What can you do, figure out? - Come! Come on. We'll figure something out. - No! Wait. Come. Enter! But I'm not alone. So come on in. Mom, let me introduce Julia. Good afternoon, ma'am. - Good afternoon. Please take a seat. Please. Would you like some tea? Apologies. My son has told me that you're in some trouble. No, just simply, today... I was kicked out of my flat. Are you working in Warsaw? No, I'm not working anywhere right now. But I wouldn't want, because... It's a complicated story. Have you studied something? What have you studied? Polish philology. But in Bialystok. It was simply not the best major, I was not a good student. But I have a diploma. I graduated from the university. Make some tea. I just simply... I was renting a room in quite a big flat. And the owners of this flat have come back. I was kicked out. I mean not kicked out but I simply... Don't you have some family, friends? I understand that a person of my age should have. Should have someone who could help, but... No, I don't have family. And no real friends. I mean... When I was kicked... When I left. Since I'm not working there. I don't want to have anything to do with these people. I wouldn't want to ask any of them for help, ever again. If not for your son. I'm thinking, how could I, could we help you? It seems that... I think you don't need to help me. You shouldn't have... Excuse me. Good night. But mom, we can't leave it like that. - I apologize. Ma'am, please stay. You can stay for the night in my husband's room. It's not a problem. Tonight you can stay here. And tomorrow we will call somewhere. It's not a problem. Please stay. Thank you. I have to go to the station, excuse me. - But why? I've left my suitcase there. I have no clothes. Tomek can go there, please stay here. I will go, pick up your things. Just the key to the locker. Here you have the code. The key? There's no key. Here's a number. Would you like some hot tea? Hot tea? No, thank you. Express train from Leipzig to Lublin, via Deblin will depart from track number one at platform number two. Alright, it seems that I have to tell you something. You don't have to! No, but I'm staying at your place for the night. No, ma'am it's not because you're staying here. I want to understand. If you came here for real help. You need to help me understand you. Alright, I apologize. I don't like talking about it. I worked in censorship. I knew you wouldn't like it. Or at least that it would strike you. Ma'am, it's hard for me to like it. Thanks to censorship, we have another circulation And my son... Tomek. Distributes the newspaper of the secondary circulation. And the fact that I meet you, who... Ma'am, I... I would like to understand. When you... You work in newspaper censorship? Yes. I used to work. But it doesn't matter. Sorry, you used to work. If you have some article let's say. For example with Andrzej Szczypiorski. You see here, there's... Here it's censored. Explain this to me, you read this and... And you just think that it's... Why you are deleting this? What are you guided by? I'm not thinking anything. I'm given the directives what can or cannot be printed. I'm just reading and judging from that perspective. - But... That's it. I was reading and judging. Alright, but... But you are very aware that for example you are dealing with our pope. Primate Andrzej Szczypiorski. They are... And what, then somehow your hand wouldn't tremble? You don't have a sense of... It didn't tremble, I didn't think because it was a while back. There are clear guidelines. For example you can't print names of some institutions. You can't print some facts, surnames. I'm given those guidelines and I'm cutting those things out. I doesn't matter if it's a cardinal or a pope? I'm just doing my job. This is how I'm earning my money. I'm not thinking too much about it. I was not. These were my job obligations. I don't understand? But you're crossing out what someone else has said. Not what you're thinking. Yes, but... If under each article a censor would need to put a signature, it would have been different. I'm not signing it, I'm just doing my job. I wasn't thinking too much about it. The matter of these guidelines being wise or not is another topic. But you... I don't work there anymore. You were not giving a signature, but you knew what you were doing. Yes I did. Speaking about the morality, I understood. No, I was not thinking about it too much. The majority of the censors don't think about that either. Besides, we're not meeting up with authors. If we did, things could've looked different. Anyway I'm tired of it. One day I started to think about it. What is that newspaper? How do you know something was crossed out? I had to read it. - But how do you know it was censored? Usually it's done in such a way that you're not aware of it. No, ma'am. You are aware. Ma'am, when you are reading, you sometimes notice. No, a good censor crosses it out in such a way you don't notice. I can believe that you were not a good censor. I wasn't a good one. But finally you have rebelled. So it means you couldn't live with that for too long. You see. That's what it is. For some time you can do it. Fight against conscience. But after some time... You said it yourself. Let's agree that I didn't pick any battle with my own conscience. I simply decided to earn money this way after graduating from Polish philology. No one else wanted to hire me. But one day I started to wonder. - Exactly! Besides I didn't like my employers, they are morons and that's it. - Exactly! Exactly! This is exactly what conscience is. The fact that you are sick of it, that you don't want to do it anymore. You name it. I understand that you are afraid of such words like "to moralize" and so on. But I'm afraid too. Alright, conscience... Please, don't tell him where I used to work. He would be concerned about it. Do you know if your mother has nail polish remover somewhere? No, I think she doesn't have. For sure not, she's not painting her nails. You know what? I told her yesterday that I used to work in censorship, 'cause she made me angry. I know. She's told you? Yes. But she wasn't supposed to tell you. We don't keep secrets between each other. Alright, but she wasn't supposed to tell you. Did you believe in that? I believe it, why wouldn't I? Do you love her? A lot? A lot. But not too much? Why would I love her too much? I don't know, when I look at the two of you... At this house. Do you believe that your mother is a saint? No. Maybe you're looking for someone like your mother. Maybe that's why... Why your father has left you? I don't know, I was six years old back then. I don't remember much. Maybe it's her fault, huh? I really don't know. I was so small back then. What could I remember. Maybe she was too big of a saint? Here's the key in case you wanted to go somewhere during the day. I won't go anywhere. So what, you'll be at home all day? And won't go anywhere? - No. I'll be waiting. It's nice to wait. If you have someone to wait for. It's nice what... Leave already. It's a bit difficult to help her. I offered... I offered some small jobs to her. But she... She doesn't want anything. Cleaning jobs? My dear... Cleaning is very well paid right now. And it's not such hard work. I thought it was important to her to have at least some money. Organizing some other job takes time. Obviously abroad it would've been better to clean. But she said they have taken away her passport. And do you believe her? But after such a job, she must have a penalty period. I don't know. She said that she won't leave the house. And that she doesn't have any money. But then she says she bought some flowers. I bought her flowers. And I gave her the keys. It's not too good. It's better to make an extra key. She could loose it. Oh mom. When it comes to loosing keys. We have an expert here. I don't understand her. I don't know when she's telling the truth or not. But the fact that she's lying doesn't mean that... We should apply our standards to her. She has a different background. And the lies... They're a form of some self-defense. We already have jonquils? From the greenhouse, yes? Dear son. Imagine that you're in a forest. And how do you imagine this forest to be? A bright glade on a sunny day, all around big trees. Oaks. Alright. And you come across an obstacle. What obstacle is that? It's a fallen tree. And what do you do? I just cross it. With no problems, you just cross? The tree is big, overgrown by some bushes. And I cross. Then you continue and suddenly find a cup. What is this cup like? The cup, the cup is... White, white, white... It's white. White. And what do you do with it? I pick it up. And then what? But what do you do with it? You take it with you? I take it. - Alright. You walk and you... Then you come across water. A spring. What is that is this spring like? Clean. And what do you do? I take some water with the cup. And what do you do? And I drink water from the cup. And what after that? And then I take a swim in the spring. Yes? And what? What? What then? You leave and what happens with that water? Wait, I took some water with the cup, took a bath. You drank the water, took a swim in the spring and then what? And then I continue. Alright, so now pay attention. The forest is life. A bright glade in the sun. The obstacles are obstacles. You jump over the fallen tree with no problems. The cup means money. White. You just take them and continue. And the spring means love. It means the erotism in your life. Not only you have drunk from that white cup. You drank it and then you took a swim there. Where do you have the apple from? I have. You took it from the stall? You took just one? - One. Take a look. One. Take a look. You have to pay for it. Are you crazy? Why? You gonna tell him I've stolen it? No, I'll say that I want to pay for one apple. I always forget to buy bread. There's always too much or not enough. You don't want to eat? No, thank you. Ma'am, I wanted... I wanted to ask you. Whether my son... Is my son in love with you? Why won't you ask him? Ma'am... I'm not sure if my son... Maybe my son doesn't know it yet. He's still very young. He didn't live life yet. I don't know. Do you believe that... This age difference between us... If I understand what you're saying. No, ma'am. It's not the most important thing. It's not the most important. To fall in love... That's the biggest problem. That for a very long time we can't see the difference. Between falling in love with yourself thanks to another person and love. Love. Marriage. It's a very difficult... A very difficult, laborious work. It requires a great deal of work. Ma'am. Marriage rarely works. It's probably the most difficult thing in the world. For the marriage to be good, there must be so much... So many marriages are falling apart. The ones that seemed to be meant to be. The once that seemed to have worked. They rarely work out. And I am afraid. Simply. For my son. I understand that you are not very content... About your son's possible choice. If it was concerning me. Because I don't know if it's concerning me. I don't know if he's in love. If anything will result from this. I understand that I'm not your... ideal life companion candidate for him. I wanted to tell you that... That for me he is... I've never met anyone like him before. Whatever is supposed to come out of it, is very important to me. I'm not sure if you can understand that. For me it would be a chance. Not sure if the only one, but a chance. Exactly. I understand that it's a chance for you. Sorry for saying that. But I'm trying to imagine it. How my son... How... What are you able to give to my son. I would want to believe. I would want to very much. Maybe he is more adult than I think he is. Mothers always make the same mistake. I still see a child in him. I won't live his life for him. Obviously. I cannot sleep. Maybe I can give you some medicine? Listen... Tell me, whether... Could you ever fall in love with me? Of course I could. And do you believe that I could change? You've seen me in such a terrible state. I would really try and... I believe. That I could swear to you, that... That it won't be for nothing. That it won't happen again. I'm worried about you. I'm also worried. Exactly. Talk to me. Do you think... About her... Seriously? Yes. "Yes". What does it mean? Do you want to help her? Or do you think... About her for life? For life. But... Dear child, have you thought... You come from two different worlds. Different experiences, different values. - Mom.... Alright, but why are you assuming, that she... After all you're the one who taught me that you have to come across other people. You said that you can't just enclose yourself in your own environment. That you have to be open to everything that happens to you. If I've met her... I can't leave it be like that. I can't just walk by it like that. I cannot not use this opportunity. It's a great chance for me. Maybe it happens for the first and last time to me. Maybe it won't happen ever again. I must. I need to take that chance. But our life is not some charity institution. Why charity? She can... Why am I the only one to give to her? She can give me much more than I can give to her. Why do you think that it's only charity. It's not like that. It's come sort of sickness. You've fallen ill over her. You've imagined something. No, mom. You have no right to say that. You can't prove that it won't work. How do you know that? Impossible. You don't know that. You have no proof. I live a bit longer on this world. Believe me. My intuition. I feel that there's something untrue about this. It's some sort of a lie. It can't be... Mom. Your intuition already failed you once with my father. Julia has told me that she wants to be baptized. I'm not my soullessness, but... She has to move out. She has to. It means that I'm moving out with her. What are you afraid of, actually? That something will happen between us? It's already happened. For this day, for this morning. Hail to thee, Lord. Hail to thee, Lord. Thank you Lord, for the fasting with which you prepare me for your and mine resurrection. Thank you, Lord. Dear God, I beg you for all the people, all the families, all the homes. For the word "love". For everyone to understand what real love is about. The love of Jesus Christ. The love on the cross. I beg you, Lord. We beg you, Lord. For all what we posses in our lives. We have it from you and thanks to your love. Be glorified, Lord. Thank you, Lord, for loving us just the way we are. Thank you, Lord. God, you are the one. You are the peace. Thank you, Lord. You have a right to have your own life. It's your own matter, the matter of your choices. And it doesn't need to suit my expectations. I told you what I'm afraid of, what I think about it. I would like to know. What are your plans? Do you intend to get married? Or you want to live like that longer, to test? What do you want to do? Because I need to know that. I'm not able to support both of you with my salary. And even if I could... I shouldn't. What do you... - Yes, yes... You want me to join my father in Berlin. This way you could earn money faster. You can go there together, but as far as I know... You don't have a passport. I'm not sure if it's true? I no longer understand what is true or not. If you can travel together... It's the truth that I cannot get a passport. Simply, if... Yes? If, if... If you want to take the responsibility, then... You must finish what you started. Take the responsibility. You want to be adult. You want to decide. Is such an economic pressure... Is it Christian? Ma'am. At first glance it seems not to be. But... It is Christian. I think so. My son, has to take the responsibility. He must be responsible for you. Not me but him. It's his matter, the matter of his choice. And the responsibility is to work for, to support someone. It's not easy for me to talk about that with you. But I think it's the right thing to do. What about the university? I think that maybe... The sabbatical? I want him to think about it. I will go to Berlin. Yes, you will be able to send the money. And then it will be easier to rent a flat. You will send the money. You mean, what flat? To rent? You mean, what flat? The flat for us? I don't understand. In the future for the two of you. And now you can find a room. No, no, no. She will be living here. You mean that this is what you decide? Yes, she will be living here in my room. I think there is enough space for the two of you. So what would you like to do here? Work. It means? For example painting the flats. It's a great idea! A great one! I like it a lot. There was one painter here. Guess who, a youngster? Adolf. He was painting, very nice. Listen, do you know how to do it? Yes, I did it once with a friend at his place. Yes? You take the paint. Some solvent. And then they need to paint after you, right? And how much would you like to earn doing this? I would like... 200-300 marks. Yes... And have you thought of some other occupation? I can do anything, as long as they pay me. For example pick up the trash. Ah! Trash. You know that I would swap places with a garbage man? One of the best occupations, but you need to be in mafia. Have a work permit. It's a great job, they earn good money. It's not for you. So we started at 300 marks. It's not even that much. If you earned 500, it would've been awesome. Yes, it would've been... And such a position to earn 600 marks. Would be even better! Alright. You have that job. Really? Yes, really. You have that job. Wait. I know how to do that. What are you doing? Me? I just need a pen. No, no, no! Dad, no. What do you mean "no"? - I can't. How come you "can't"? Stop it. 800. Please, I can't. 1000, I'm writing it. - No, no. 1500. - No. 2000 marks. - No, no, no. I can't. Tomek! It's a scholarship from your father. Treat it like that. You will be able to go see real paintings for that. Visit galleries. Educate yourself. Dad, I'm sorry but I need to earn this money myself. But why, you have it here. Should be enough. Take it, for real. I can't. I know, I know how it's called. Forgot already about it. There is something like that. I was a bit different myself. It's called the pride of a young man. Who wants to be independent. It's not about that. - He wants to earn money himself. Take nothing from his father. It's not about that. It would take too long to explain. I simply need to earn that money myself. You need to think one thing over, It's not even about that money. But about... But about receiving it. You simply need to know how to receive. Think about it. If you don't know how to receive something, maybe later in life you won't be able to give. But I know that. Do you? Good that you know that. That's what I like. Who do you take this stubbornness after, Tomasz? Julia. I told you already it's not here. I told you. Why are you looking for it? Prescribe it to me. It's not about the medicine. You need to get yourself together, Julia. I cannot sleep. - But listen to me. I don't want to spend one more night like that. Please, prescribe it to me once again. - Have come patience. Listen, you need to be able to wait. He left it there for you. Wait. Just a bit more patience. I can't. I don't know what is happening to me. Can't you understand that? I can't be alone. But Julia... I'm here with you. You're not alone now. Calm down. I need to be with him. Let's drink some tea. I don't want! I want to sleep! Can't you understand that? There's a line! Wait! How rude. Is Mister Kwiatkowski here? Do you have an appointment? No, I don't but I need to see him. Wait a moment! Please don't enter! You can't. I apologize. Hi! Hi. How are you? I haven't seen you in a while. Listen... - What is it about? I will get an invitation, I'll have everything set. Help me so that they grant me the passport. But it's not for me. How come "not for you"? You know. Wrong department. Don't be silly. What does it mean? Can't you have it done? Don't you know how life is? Whom do you think you're talking to? You think that I'm some youngster who doesn't understand anything? So far everything was working? You were always able to call me to ask for things. And now suddenly it's a "no"? Calm down. There are regulations... I don't give a shit about those regulations! I want to get the passport. I want to be a free person. So what? I know I'm not allowed to. I know that I'm under penalty period. But I want to leave. Calm down, alright? I'm not going to calm down. Listen. You have to do that for me, do you understand? What's pinned you down that much? I've fallen in love. So then you will wait one year or two and you will go. I won't wait! I have to go, can you hear me? I have to go to Berlin. For a day or two. Understand me. It's a normal, human thing. I'm not playing any games. I want to see this one guy in Berlin. Just two days, please. You're giving passports to everybody. Please, do that for me. What are you laughing about? Because you know that we don't give it to everyone. Stop giving me that bullshit. - Calm down! I don't give a shit about any of this! I want to leave. Listen. Calm down. Leave. No, I'm not leaving. Don't touch me. - Leave. Don't touch me! - Leave or I'll have you removed. So call someone! Call! - Leave! I won't leave until you do that for me. I won't! You will! Are you gonna leave? No. Listen, I'm only asking you a favor. I know it's possible. But it's not my department. - Please. Listen, so far I didn't care. With whom I'm friends with, whom I talk to. Whom I am greeting. Now I don't want. I want to quit all of this. But I want to leave for two days. You done? So leave now. - No. Leave! - No! Julia. Stop acting crazy, alright? Hello? Hello, mom? Mom? - Hello Tomek. Can you ask for Julia? Yes, wait. Julia. Phone call. Julia. Tomek's calling. Phone call from Berlin, Julia. Julia, what have you taken again? I... Yes? Hello? Yes. Can you... Call tomorrow. But I have... It's difficult to make phone calls from here. What's happened? Tomek, call tomorrow. But what's happened? I can hear she's home. I'm telling you to call tomorrow. Why you won't give her the phone? I can hear she's home. What's happened? Don't worry. Call tomorrow. I want... with him... talk... I need to talk to him. I'm coming! I'm coming! Dear God. Tomek. You kicked her out. I've told you I haven't. You changed the locks. She lost the keys, what was I supposed to do? What is wrong with that? I don't believe you. What don't you believe? I don't believe you. Have I ever, when promised... Have I ever broken my promise? I understand how do you feel right now. Why are you unfair? You stopped thinking, my child. Think for a second. Come to my place for her address. I expected that you would want to know it. So I found out where she is. Will you take me with you? I love you. Ma'am! I won't come today for the injection, 'cause... Because I'm going out, alright? I will go... Change clothes. We will go... I will change. - Wait, wait, wait. What do you want to tell me? You should rest a bit more. I will rest. I will rest, we will go... Things have changed. We can't go now. You see, I had to come back very fast. From Berlin. Because of you, and... I didn't manage to earn enough money to rent a flat, support us. But why did you have to come back from Berlin because of me? You left, didn't leave any message. I had to come back. We can't live in my house, because of this situation with my mother. But what's happened? Why did you have to come back? What did I do that you had to come back? You left without telling anyone. You didn't leave any information where you would stay. So I had to come back. But why did you have to come back? I didn't do anything! Why don't you believe me? I couldn't leave you alone. How do you know I was left alone? Why don't you want to take me from here? I'm taking you. Calm down. We just can't go home. Since my mother has kicked you out, we can't come back there. Who's told you your mother has kicked me out? Who's told you that? That your mother has kicked me out? How come? I left by myself. Why are you like that? Why are you saying such things. Why are you pretending? - Calm down. I don't need to be taken away from here. Do you think I can't live without all of that? That I can't live without your mother, the house? That fucking life? Waking up in the morning... Calm down. Everything will be fine. Nothing will be fine. Why did you trick me like that? I didn't trick you, I won't leave you... - You tricked me! Why? Do you think that I should go back there? That I cannot manage without it? - Calm down. Why? Why all of this... Calm down! That fucking life. With such a God, that... Will forgive everything, but you just need to believe in him. And everything will be alright. Calm down. Sit down. Sit down here. Why did you make me believe in that? That people don't trick one another. That they don't lie. That they love each other. That they're good. Will you take me from here? Please. I ask you, take me away from here. Alright. I can't stand this place. Please, I will learn all of it. I will try. I will believe, that... That you need to treat your teeth, put fillings in them... Believe in everything. At the geography studies they teach you that... Zanzibar is in Africa and... You believe in all of it. You're not interested in checking if it's really there? Why do you need to believe in everything? Kiss me. There's an angel sitting on my head. What now...? What do you think now? What will happen? Well... I will... I will go deeper into that. I can't leave it like that. I must fight for her. If... If... If you see in her... If you see in her the values you always... Believed in... Then... Then love... And... "Love and do what you want." Saint Augustine. Dear son. I will always be with you. I will try... I will try to believe.
