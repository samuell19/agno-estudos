Calling the matter belonging to Eduardo Moreno and Francisco de Amil. BA 397612. Calling matters belonging to Carvell Jackson. Open matter BA406128. Calling the matter belonging to Devon Williams, YA073193. And here we have a situation where three young men acquire weapons and a shooting took place. The fact that Mr. Williams possessed one of those weapons during the course of the altercation with the police, requires the court impose 25 years to life. With respect to count two, the court will impose 15 years to life. I am mindful that the gang allegation was found true by the jury. The total state prison commitment for Mr. Williams is 71 years, four months, to life. Thank you. Sentencing people regularly to life sentences, you'd have to be less than human not to... be weighed down by the reality of, of what you're doing, of what you're committing another human being to. - Hey! - Oh, oh, oh. Hey! Running a marathon? All right, sweetie. What'd I tell you? Look. Move it! When I came to the mission, I was just at my lowest point. Hmm. Worn out, miserable. Just gave up on everything, you know. Well, this is what I used to call home. I slept up under here for maybe two years. Climbing up into this little cubby hole, rats, pigeons and all. And that's what the drugs and alcohol will do to you. It will tell you that it's fine to live in the... something like this. Climbing in and out of a hole on a regular basis, like, it's perfectly normal. I went to prison in 2005. After I got out of prison, I still was messing around, dabbling in drugs. One day, I just woke up and said, um, "You know I'm tired of just doing this to myself." You know? I knew that I needed help. - Good morning. - Well, good morning. - How are you? - Good. Something got you out of bed early. Yeah. David was one of the first members of the running club. The first day I went out with them, I knew I had found another passion. And that was running. You just have to discipline yourself. And that's something I haven't had much of all my life. Like I said, I was just running wild and you don't plan, you know? You just seem to wander and you sometimes go astray. I ended up sentencing one of the defendants who came before me to state prison. After that individual was released from state prison, he shows up to court one day. "Judge Mitchell, do you remember me?" And "Yes, I do remember you." "Well, I was paroled to the Midnight Mission, I'm getting my life together and I would really like you to come down and meet some of the people that I am spending every waking hour with trying to deal with my addiction issues, "trying to get on the right track." And so I said, "Sure, I'll come down." And at some point, the conversation turned to "Well, is there any way that you can think of that you could contribute to our program?" I started out with just a few runners a few mornings a week. And they learned very quickly that you do not run a full marathon without a lot of training. I came in the mission 300 pounds. And Judge Mitchell came in, "I'm starting a running club." I couldn't waddle down the street. I'd waddle down the street, and it's "Oh, god I'm dying." And I waddled a little further everyday and I just kept on doing that. No matter how bad your head's going or what's going on, show up. Things'll happen. You think you've got it hard? Show up. Things'll happen. Where's Ben? Ben is... He can't run, his stomach. Do you know... I mean, is it a stitch or is it just upset stomach? - I think it's an upset stomach. - Okay, good, good. Okay. He felt like vomiting. I said, you know what you got to do, right? - Find a spot and just do it. - Right. This thing right here is my red ball of anger. With a gun in his mouth, blowing his head off. 'Cause at that time, I wish I could've done that. I came into Los Angeles right before the summer of 1990. Uh, I came out here to, to make it, you know, quote-unquote, to make it big. ♪ I don't need My head kicked in ♪ ♪ And I don't need ♪ I'm in a signed band working with this monster producer. I got to meet all my heroes. ♪ And I don't need Your hand of god ♪ It was everything that I wanted, and I'm not happy. Just somewhere down the line, my drinking started taking me into alcoholic DTs, I would end up in hospitals. And then, I got in a three-car accident. On the way to a liquor store, totaled three cars, I got arrested. I got out of jail, and then I just drank as much as I could, hoping to die. It was horrible to go through. And I had no options left and it was just, I'm down on Skid Row. You know, "I'm better than this." And "No, no, no I'm not, I'm not better than that at all." And that's where I wound up, Skid Row. And I lost everything when I went down there. I'm doing well in school, and I get it. I get all the theory stuff. I'm one of those guys now that gets it. And I work my butt off at it. But now, I can see myself going for a BA in Music. I want to write for film. First, I've got to finish this semester. Only live one day at a time. But if you asked me, "What's your dream?" Well, today, that's my dream. Sorry about that. Are you guys getting good grades? Yeah? I'm going to college right now, right? I should have been going to college when I was 20 years old. And then when I went to prison, then I thought about it and I said, "Why did I do this shit that I used to do?" Guess how much time I did in prison? Take a guess, man. - Twenty years? - Twenty years? No. Take a guess. - Fifteen? - Fifteen? Nah. - Too low? - High. Thirty. No, almost 29. Twenty-eight years, nine months, 17 days. This is the border line right here, the two gangs. This street right here, Rosecrans, is the border line. I would come this way. It was like 7:30, there were still people out on the street right here walking around, kids, families. I came all the way right here. I could see two guys coming out on a bicycle, wearing t-shirts. And I was just right here, in between the street right here, and I just dropped my window... and then, I said, "What gang are you guys from?" I didn't even say it like that. I just said "Where are you from?" Which means, "What gang are you from?" I had a weapon and, um, I started shooting at them. They started tryin' to go fast... and, um, I seen them both fall right there in the driveway. And when they both fell, I, I knew I'd hit them. I tell you, everybody that takes a life, when you get busted, you wish you could go back and turn everything around. When I was going to the parole board, I would tell them, "I'm not the guy that, um... that did this." The guy that did this is long gone. As a Deputy District Attorney, I would periodically go to the state prisons to represent the interests of the people of the state of California, when these individuals would come up for parole. Rafael Cabrera walked into the room and I listened to him talk and explain what he had done. I was the first person to say... "I'm not opposing parole." And it took probably five or so years before the parole board ended up agreeing with me. I saved every single letter that Rafael ever sent me. And you can see, they are not short little greetings. Here's one, page 16. And this correspondence went on for five to seven years. I'm mindful that a convicted murderer and a judge on the superior court don't often times share regular correspondence, let alone develop, uh, a, a highly-prized friendship. Okay? That, that's unusual. I know that. Okay. At the beginning, I was a little scared. Him, uh, him running down to Skid Row. But, um, it makes him so happy. Maybe the running club is like a counterweight, you know, for all the horrible things he has to do to people. He doesn't do it to people but, you know, that he has to sentence people to these long sentences. Maybe it's a way for him, in his own mind, to do something good. That... He wanted to be a priest at one point. And, um... I think he still has the heart of a priest. Yeah, I think he's making a difference. Especially in the lives of some of these guys. And they're making a difference in his life, too. Part of your registration fees today will be sending the members of the Midnight Mission Running team across the Atlantic Ocean to run in Accra, Ghana. - Yeah! - Thank you, thank you, thank you for that opportunity. The reason we travel overseas to run marathons... It is an incredible motivator to keep these guys on the straight and narrow, to keep them involved in recovery. The other thing is it exposes them to the larger world that ultimately, I want them to be a part of. I've never been out of the country before, and just to be with my teammates, you know, run with my teammates in another country, explore the new scenery and get to know new people. So I'm looking forward to that. There's Ghana here. I don't think I can leave the country, because I'm on high-risk parole. The judge goes "They'll let you go." And then I said "I don't know, I don't think so, man. I mean, you know, it's difficult for me to go from one state to another." I need permission and all this and that. And he just says "Hey, you know what, if you're going with me they're gonna let you go." So, I'm still training from six miles to going to 27. That's a whole different thing there, you know. So, we stick, and we push and help each other out, and that's what it's all about. ♪ Never did tell the truth ♪ From the beginning. Go. ♪ Never did tell it right ♪ Man, my vocals suck. Oh, It's okay. You got something to work on. So what would be a chord change? I don't know. I just got to sit there and grind it out and figure out, and dig around for the next. It started out as friends, and it blossomed into this... I don't know what the heck the world is coming to. I had to see him running to believe it. And I went out and ran with him, like, "Oh, my god, this old guy can really run." International Man of Old and Little Fat Girl are dating. Here I am. Like I think, James Bond, The International Man of Mystery, I'm the International Man of Old. Laying on the street with my knees all shot out. Yeah, he's on Skid Row just drunk. Wow. - I'm sorry. - Oh, wow. He's just hammered. - Man. - I'm just kidding. I'm sorry. I'm an elite super athlete. - Oh, my god. - I'm not? You're telling me right here, right now I'm not an elite athlete? Your legs are like, falling off at the end of every run. No, they're not. To share the most intimate thing I could give to myself in this relationship, is the running club. - Good job. - Whoo. This is the most intimate thing I can do, is to show you where I come from. Good job, Mody. If you don't love me or like me for this, this is exactly who I am. Hey, official. I got to go. "I got to go." He's a mover and a shaker. Bye, Daddy Cakes. It's a life-saver. You blow into this thing, you got alcohol on your breath, it shuts your car off. So this is, you know, the tail end of 11,000 dollars worth of fines and a DUI that I had right before I went homeless. Man, I got a driver's license now which is phenomenal. I keep using that word, but everything is phenomenal these days, but... whatever that is. One of the challenges we had with David, was to get him a passport. We didn't have a birth certificate that the State Department would accept for David. They wanted other documents. It dawned on me that if I pulled his criminal history, he has been arrested 23 separate times. If he wasn't a US citizen, he would have been deported. And I just sent as much of that material to the State Department, uh, as I could glean from these files. And... There obviously was enough in them that convinced the Department of State that, uh, David was a US citizen. Embassy of the Republic of Ghana. Valid for entry within three months, okay. So even if we get delayed in baggage claim. Am I disappointed that we cannot take more? I clearly am. But the three that are definitely going have earned the right to be in that category. They go on the runs when they're not feeling well. They go on the runs when they've had three hours of sleep. They deserve to go. The shot you're going to need to get in and out of the country is yellow fever, um, polio to go on. Even though you were immunized as children, it's worn off. Rabies, we don't recommend that you be immunized, but you need to be aware they do have a problem with monkeys. So you don't want to encourage the monkeys, you don't want to play with the monkeys, you don't want to feed the monkeys. I see you wear glasses. Don't put them on top of your head. They reflect, and the monkeys do go after them. Okay? You might want to take what we call a diarrhea kit with you. Are you guys getting scared yet? - No. - No. Just the monkeys. Just watch out for the monkeys. Well, they do, so you don't wear your glasses on top of your head. You don't annoy the monkeys, you don't try to feed the monkeys. Um, they get used to people feeding them. Oh, my god. Getting bit by a monkey. We, or at least some of us, will be in Accra, Ghana. The last conversation I had with the PO was that, uh, the policy is, as long as Rafael is on parole uh, they won't let him leave the country. At least I got a passport for like, next time. If not this time, next time. Well, you and I are going to share a stamp in that passport sooner or later. - God willing. - Yeah, well. It's all right. There's a time for everything. I mean, we may have to do the... ...foreign marathon next year together. Just, you know, just be patient. - We're out of here. - God bless you. Take care of yourself. It's true to form that you're here. - I know, man. All right. - Okay? - Take care. God bless, you guys. - Okay. Okay. - Martin. - Martin. - What's your name? - Bam. Thank you. We're all from Los Angeles. We have been running together as friends. And we decided we wanted to do a marathon in Africa. And so, we talked amongst ourselves and decided Accra would be a wonderful marathon to do. One, two, one, two! One, two, one, two, one, two! One, two, one, two! I slept about two hours, three hours if that, on and off. So I need to get my race number on, where I do not cover up the Midnight Mission logo. Oh, my god, for real? - Goddammit! - Power outage. It went out again. It worked for a while, and then the electricity just cut off. Give me that flashlight. Okay, we're ready to go. Number 11. Go! Running in Ghana was a real challenge. You had incredible humidity. You had triple digit heat. And you were breathing in truck fumes... almost the entire distance. Seeing a place like Ghana and what a privilege it's been to come down here and participate in the marathon and participate in my being sober. Yeah. It's hard to put into words right now. I will remember this for the rest of my life. Come to Africa you know, to run in a marathon after 35 years of drugs and addiction, ten years sleeping on the streets on Skid Row. And here we are in Africa. Wow. Now, go down that space! The marathon is a test every time you do it. It never gets easier. - That was brutal. - That was brutal. Yeah, that was the hardest ever. By far. And the kids out there, they're laughing and playing on top of garbage. Every day sleeping next to smelling all that. I don't think I'll never complain about anything again after seeing what I experienced out here. No, we got to be grateful, man. You got to be grateful. For even the smallest things. The running club started just about a year and two or three months ago. And word of mouth does the magic that it does. One guy tells another guy, "Hey, you know, if you'd like to run... be at the desk at 5:45 and we take off." Mody is a relatively new member of the running club. He was attending college in New York, had a very promising career before substance abuse derailed that. He came to this country on a student visa from Senegal and, uh, ended up at the Midnight Mission. Okay. You know? It's really motivating. I really like the fact that, uh... That's right. Even though I had met the judge before through the Midnight Mission, I never ran with him or the team before. And I just saw the camaraderie, and, and everyone rooting each other on, and I wanted to be a part of that. We are all hopeless, die-hard alcoholic drug addicts, and we are the least person that you would think would be running, or doing anything with their lives, really. I grew up in the suburb of Seattle. When I was two weeks shy of turning 21, I got introduced to heroin and cocaine. I was never involved in any sort of street life, but when I got involved with those hard drugs, I found myself in a place where I just started doing crazy things in order to maintain that addiction, which in time, led to homelessness. I get a little behind on laundry, but, I'm gonna get it taken care of today. Hey, I have a good idea. I have a good idea. Money? Take that down to the car. I got it. Okay, okay, let's not do that. What? You have me. Well, you have me. I'm your mommy. I'd been homeless on the streets for several years, and my son and I ended up in Los Angeles. Don't drag it on the ground, though, 'cause it will break. There you go. I really had no other way of taking care of him. I'm, I'm moving back. This summer. In July. I'm moving back to Seattle. It's my home, I miss it, I love it. I have created so much wreckage... because of my drinking and, you know, drug use that it's little by little, little by little, one spoonful at a time scooping out of this mountain starting to, to climb out of the hole. Today is my last day at the Midnight Mission. So, I'm pretty excited. It's just another step forward for me. I'm going to be working at a transitional house. I'll be managing the building and, um, you know, taking care of the clients that live in the building. Gotta get this stuff packed up and ready to go. So you know, I just decided in my mind, man. I'm not gonna use again. I'm not, no. Regardless of the problems or situations that I go through. That's not gonna be an option anymore, to pick up and use. I did get from my mother the value of extending yourself to other people. This neighborhood... late summer of 1965 following the Watts riots, my Mom brought me down here. I never knew my mother when she wasn't gravely ill. As sick as she was, wheelchair-bound, I do not have a single memory of her once ever complaining. She wanted the days that she did have with her son and daughter to be as meaningful as possible. Instead of taking us to the pizza parlor, to Disneyland, to the park to have fun, you know. No, you need to come down to Watts. You need to experience the epicenter of what was going on. Please go in your homes. Please go in your homes. The Watts riots created a real sense of fear in Los Angeles, that this great melting pot on the west coast, maybe things weren't melting as nicely as people had expected. She died in 1966. Less than a year after the Watts riots. I remember the day of her death you know, very, very clearly. When I came home, what was odd was my father was home. He said, "You know, uh, Mama didn't make it." And... Those words still... uh, just me, me saying that. Ah. I'll, I'll never forget that. No. Flats! There's no flats in string music. Sharps in string music. Flats. And the mid... this nonsense right up here, whatever that means. Radio edit four, suck it. I want to try to get into the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. Out of all the schools that I've looked at, they have a new program that opens up on the fall of 2015, the inaugural program. And I wanna be one of the first people, to be there for the first class that gets in there. There's just no time, You know, I sleep three hours a night, man. This is my audition for the conservatory in January. All of it makes me sick. Do you ever hate something so much, a piece of music so much that if you ever heard it again you want to kill yourself? This is it right here. I just need to come up with a quality piece of music. I spat out a lot of crap out of frustration, it's just frustrating. I take it personal, man. I hear big music and I need to get it out of my head onto paper, and then have players play it. Now, how do you do that? It's just, I don't know. I'm learning. There's so much to learn. Nah, just all... just completely off. All of it. Fuck you. If I was on pills, it would be fucking awesome, but I haven't ran in five days, man. I feel horrible. This is my letter of recommendation from Judge Craig Mitchell for the school that I'm applying. It says some nice things. I'm a decent human being. That's crazy. It's hard for me to look at somebody who's writing something about me like this. And I don't know who the hell he's talking about. You know? I've been coming here for one year, volunteering here. What's up, man? What's up, man? Every time you get in trouble, this is where you end up. I ended up coming here when I was 14 years old. I got caught with a gun in school. I kept going into the juvenile hall, and they got tired of me, and they said I was incorrigible. And they made me a ward of the State, and... they took me away from my mother and my stepdad, and made the State my mother and my father. It kind of saved me, because if I had stayed on the streets, I believe I would've been killed sooner or later. I've lived more than half of my life in places like this. Where they tell you when you can eat, when you can use the restroom, when you can't. What to do, when to do it. I didn't live in your world for 29 years, I'm an alien to your world. When I come here, and I talk to the kids here, I feel like, "Hey this is home." Buenos. Um, Sunday, I went to my friend's home and we went to the park, and you know, walk his dog. I've seen the Sheriffs down the street and they stopped two guys by the curb, and so I walked down there and just lookin' and seein' like a looky-loo, Next thing I know, I was against the car and, uh, I'm in handcuffs. They didn't ask me if I was a gang member, they just ran a background check, so it stated, one, that I was a gang member, um, two, they put down in the police report that, um, I smelled like alcohol. My parole officer told me, he goes, "You know who they're going to believe. They're gonna believe the cops' story." And then now, behind this one event where this cop gets into it with somebody else and I happen to be in the area, in the vicinity, um, they're gonna say, "Okay, you were with this gang member, and you guys were drinking and you're gonna go to jail." Rafael is basically a decent, decent human being at this point in his life. What he has been doing since he has been released from prison, working with the families for the incarcerated, working with the Catholic archdiocese, speaking at schools to young people. I mean, Rafael has done an incredible amount that no parolee normally engages in. He is in a category by himself. He has to lead a very circumscribed life while he is on parole, and he dropped his guard. The worst scenario for Rafael is he's found in violation of parole and they reinstate his life sentence. This is like one of my original pieces. This is the darkness of the streets, the loneliness, downtown Skid Row where I came from. As you can see, the buildings are crumbling. As we leave from the darkness, it starts to get lighter. But we still carry our problems with us. And the way to get some help is by getting into a program, Midnight Mission. Well, I was talking to Judge Mitchell last week. And I was telling him, you know, how much I miss running with the group. But, you know, I just had to do what I needed to do to, to, you know, better my situation. You know, get my art career going. That part of my life I really do miss, you know. Just being a part of the team and running every morning just laughing and talking. I miss that. I really wanted David to run at least one more marathon with us. And I was saying, "Okay, what do we follow up with after we get back from Ghana? Where are we going next?" David was so central to that whole experience. Okay. What would be meaningful to David? I settled on Rome. He'd be able to see the Sistine Chapel, he would be able to see Michelangelo's David, he would be able to see the Pieta. Throughout Italy... the artwork would speak to him. I started this business by the grace of God. You know? I mean, I started buying little merchandise, and selling in the streets. Stuff like wallets, belts. - Can I see the black? - The, the black one? - Black. Yeah. - Oh. Bye-bye. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Leather. - 45? - 45. Yeah. My first sale of the day today, actually. Yeah, bye-bye. Here, okay. - All right, yeah. - Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Have a good day. - Okay. - Thank you. Running give me a sense of discipline and commitment. It's part of my life. And, you know, it's something I like to keep doing. Keep running and get healthier, and have a clean and healthy lifestyle. Hi. What's up, sweetheart? Huh? Okay. Please don't hop while we're crossing the street, okay? You can hop all you want when we cross the street. She got little Mike. She called me up one day and she says, "Mom, can I come down and live with you?" And I said "Sure!" And then she started getting into running. I didn't know, I had no idea. Now she runs. She says "Oh, I just got back from running 15 miles." And I went "What?" Okay? And now, they're going to Rome. I say, "Can I go too?" But no, I'm babysitting. - Hi. - Hi. Get in here. Good to see you! My mom lives in Los Angeles, so I came down here to stay with her. And that didn't work out. I planned on just coming down here, you know, getting sober, picking up the pieces and moving back up to Seattle. And I was unable to get sober when I came to Los Angeles. I continued drinking. I ended up in the Midnight Mission, and things really turned around for me there. And actually, I got my apartment from one of the board members of the Midnight Mission who was gracious enough to take a chance on me based on my... bad credit history and my past. I never did well at school. I always thought I was stupid. You know, I was uneducated to say the least. And that's definitely a big barrier, you know, you can't get a good job if you're uneducated. I decided that I wanted to go back to school. You know, there was an interest in surgical technology that I really liked, and I decided to pursue it. I really believe I was made to do this profession. I just, I love it so much. And I actually got a 4.0 GPA going through it. I aced all of my classes. And then, I was able to get certified as a surgical technician. Yes, hi, I'm just, uh, checking on the status of my application. Okay. Now what about the fingerprinting thing? Okay. Okay. I'm so freaked out about, you know, my criminal background. Hopefully, they'll weigh this stuff out and decide to give me a license. All right, thanks. I know that if I get hired, I'll be a good employee. You know, I just need that one person that's just willing to say, "Okay, let's, let's, let's give her a chance." You know, "Let's see what she can do." Yeah, it says I was cussing at the cops over here and that's where the involvement happened. They'd seen me right here, and they were like "Hey, you two, come on over here." They say that the guy who was obviously drunk that Rafi was standing next to... was giving off an odor of alcohol. So I guess they thought maybe, uh, Rafi also was giving off an odor of alcohol, but that's not any evidence of drinking in the park. So there really isn't anything here. I'm gonna talk to the prosecutor and hope that we can just get this matter dismissed. The only thing Rafi did wrong was walk over there to stick his nose in there. So... But being nosey is not a crime. Almost every time I end up going down to a run, someone will approach me. "Judge Mitchell, is it possible that I could go to Rome too?" Then I try and crunch the numbers and contact my friends and see if we can arrange the financing. If I can go to Thomas' brother in law, get the two grand, put that on with the 500. I know you came through with us for Ghana, and, you know, if you could step up again, you know what that's gonna mean to one or two very lucky guys at the Mission. I've got you down for two. Your ma is down for one. If you could contact the lady in charge, and get that dollar amount to me... He doesn't spend money on anything. I mean... nothing! Except running shoes, plane trips, you know. And so, this is what makes him happy. My involvement with the running club gives me the ability to impact lives in a way that I cannot as a judge. Madam juror 16, good afternoon. Thank you. Please. What I do as a judge, is strictly defined by the law. Sometimes I would like to jump over my bench get behind counsel table and deliver an effective argument or examination when I don't see it being done. Uh... I like what I do in the running club in respect to dealing with people with addiction issues a heck of a lot better than I like what I have to do in the courtroom. Last time I saw David was around Easter. It's been four months. And I've been trying to call him repeatedly for the last three to four weeks. You know, what are you to make of that? - How are you doing? - Fine! Wow! You guys shocked me! - We were worried about you. - Well, I'm doing okay. - You're doing okay? Good! - Yeah! I'm doing good. Just doing what I need to do at the, uh, the painting. Okay. That's why I'm kind of, like, out of range right now. Okay. Okay. Now you look like you've been doing a little painting. Yeah. Okay. It's not like I'm just gone and forgot about you guys. - I haven't. - Okay. That's not what I'm about. No, I just gotta do what I need to do to get this art career going, and... And that's what I'm doing, so... It's taking up all of my time. And that's great. Um, but you know, if we didn't like you, we'd say "The hell with you", but, you know, we do like you. So, yeah. Friendships also need to be nurtured. Right? - Yeah, you're right. - Okay. And, you know, one of the reasons I picked Rome is because of the art. Well I haven't really been running, Judge Mitchell. I mean, you know, I, I feel those guys deserve it more so than I do, I really do. Well, I mean, are you still open to the prospect? Yeah, I'm still open. Yeah. I'm still open. Okay, because I would like you to see Rome. Yeah, I've never baked a cake before. It's Ben's 50th birthday. I like to do the birthdays, like, at midnight, not the next day. So I can be the first one to say happy birthday. I want to put my sweater on because I got like, cake, and dirtied my skirt while I was baking. So I kind of want to hide it. Can you come outside? Just come outside. Ben said, "I'm old." Baby, happy birthday. - Wow. - Devour it. All right. And I'm gonna use this. - I'm gonna go... - Yeah. "What are you playing over there? Fired!" That's a whole thing that I'm not even ready for. But hopefully, by the end of the semester, - I can conduct a piece. - Right. - I love you so much. - I love you too. Thank you for everything. At the tone, please record your message. When you are finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options. Hey, Angela, this is Junior. Um, thank god, um, the case was dismissed. And thank you for your prayers and your support. And God bless you. Take care. Call me when you get a chance, okay, Mamma? Bye-bye. For a guy like me, a Lifer that's out here, I'm on parole, but I'm an inmate. I still have a prison number. I'm out here conditionally. If I violate one of those conditions, they can reinstate my life sentence. One horrendous act does not define... a person in his or her entirety. When I first got out September 1, 2011, I wanted to see Jerry. And I couldn't find his name anywhere. So I'd seen the groundskeeper, I asked him if he could help me find him. And then he found it and he goes, "He's right here." He goes "This is where, um, the people that don't have enough money, this is where they're buried." He goes, "This is where, um", they'll bury three people in the same spot. So I came back and I paid for it. To have his name on there. I felt like, if I would die the next day that I had done one little bit that I could do, I did it. I mean, maybe that's why, you know, God wanted me to come out here. Maybe that's why I got a second chance just to come out here and put his name right here. So that he could receive a little bit of dignity. I had issues and problems, and I was angry and upset. And, um, and I happened to have a weapon. Just wanted to go and take it out on somebody. And this was the result of my anger at the time. No matter how much time I did, there's just no excuse for it. Mody, it's gonna be right there, okay? See that, see this hotel. - Cecil? - Cecil. Yes. - That's okay? - Yeah. - I don't know why I did this. - Okay, Mody. Next time, you should think twice, you know. We talked about this before, right? Anyways, so, uh, rest, - and tomorrow, give me a call. - I will. - Okay? - Thanks. Appreciate it. Why don't you rest? And move on, all right? - Good morning, -How are you? - How you doing? - All right. Mody is not running with us this morning. And, uh, yeah. Yeah, okay. Um, major relapse. Okay. Two weeks from yesterday was to be his one year anniversary of sobriety. What's good, is he reached out to a member of the running group but he's just not in a very good place at this point. How are you doing, Judge? Good, good, good. - Good. Good to see you. - Okay. Let's go on in. Right. For me, the longer I stayed away, the harder it was to come up here to see you. Believe it or not. You said you wanted to apologize. What in the heck are you apologizing for? Uh, that's just me. I've been, like, out of sight. So... Okay. And not really participating. It's that I'm just, like, dealing with so much right now. You are not in phase one of recovery anymore. - Yeah, exactly. - You... Okay? Would I love to have you run with us once a week? - I'd love it, okay? - Right. But if I am treated to you once every three months, doesn't bother me. It doesn't affect our friendship. I'm the type of person that if I say I'm dedicated to something, I try to stick to my word on that. Sometimes, I'm kinda hard on myself at areas. Mm-hm. You think? What I would like to see, I want you to commit the date of March 16th into your brain. - Take a wild guess! - I would assume... Trip to Rome? That's right. March 16th. - Okay. - Okay? All right. David was reluctant to go because he did not think he was worthy of the type of financial backing that is necessary to get him there. And this all ties into the... self-image that ex-addicts have after years of substance abuse, that they're just not worth a heck of a lot. And that's what part of this whole program is trying to overcome. - Talk to you later. All right. - Wonderful. Okay, bye. - Have a great night. - Okay. You too. - What's up, man? - Hey, what's going on? You can't throw me out. What's happening? You know what I'm saying? - Good morning. - What's up, man? My man! How you doing, man? Well, we are going to break these in the right way. Well, I'm taking it slow. I'm not rushing. Just getting my, you know, my stride back on. So when I do get out there, be ready to rock and roll. Here we come! The Midnight Runners. Here. Twelve years ago, I began to have a lot of pain in my right arm, and it became clear that I had ruptured discs in my cervical spine. And they needed to remove those discs, put in titanium rods and plates to try to prop up my neck. - Judge, you alright? - You okay? Ultimately, it took three surgeries before my neck was stabilized. I have seven vertebrae in my neck and upper back fused at this point in time. And people who have had that type of surgery are advised not to run anymore. I chose to ignore that advice. My youngest son observed, "What do you think would happen if Dad couldn't run?" Everybody agreed in my family, Oh, my god, please. May that never happen. Okay? Because Dad needs to run. All right. - And regular... - Vinegar? Come on, everybody, let's get a picture. Oh, come on. Today's a very special day. Jordan graduated from college, so we're pretty proud of him. When I graduated 8th grade, I think I was, what, 13 years old, there wasn't any fluffy, puppy dog-type speech. My Dad told me, I don't know if you remember this, but you said to me, "The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who, in a time of great moral crisis seek to maintain their neutrality." That being said to a 13-year-old was a little jarring, but it just goes to show you that, you know, this is not a facade that you're getting. You know, he doesn't make any money from this. Nobody is paying him to do this. That this is something that means... uh, a significant amount to, to his heart. Almost every single runner in the running program, their life has been a litany of disappointments and unrealized hopes. And I am determined to make sure that this experience that awaits them in Rome is going to happen. I don't want it to be another disappointment, a pie in the sky idea that never came to fruition. Whatever it takes, our running club is going to Rome. You do not wake up one morning and say you're going to run a marathon. You have to be focused over the long term, you have to be disciplined. Uh, it's a real commitment on their part. You know, if they'd stopped smoking, they'd actually, you know, do it probably much easier. Thank you. Let me just tell you what it looks like. We're just gonna back track. 17th will be a 15-miler, the 31st of January, that will be an 18-miler. 14th of February... - Is that Valentine's Day? - Yeah. Okay, another 18. 28th will be a 20-miler. Over the course of three months, we'll ultimately end up doing multiple 22-mile runs. We've got 25 people going so far. I hope you appreciate this whole enterprise is somewhere in the vicinity of about 70,000 dollars. But I've sort of crunched all the numbers and it looks like, you know, it's actually going to come together. Ghana was a baby-step. Ghana was a local marathon with no elite runners participating. Rome, on the other hand, is a well-established internationally-recognized elite marathon. I don't want to take 25 runners to Rome and have anyone, first, not finish, let alone, embarrass themselves. Sunday morning say a little prayer. Ben has his final audition for the San Francisco Conservatory about 10 o'clock on Sunday. He will find out when we are in Rome if he's accepted into the program. Ready as I'll ever be. Other than two articulations that I didn't put in the score. Of course, now, I'm obsessing about that. I'm not gonna even... "Hey, glad to meet you. Just in case I didn't put this over here." I just want to do right by the players. They're being real gracious with their time. They're used to playing some real-deal stuff and I'm learning. - ♪ Da-da-da ♪Like that. - Okay. Okay. After that wacky rhythm, it's interesting. It's so hard. - Yeah. Yeah. - All right. Beautiful. What a beautiful experience that was. Thank you for making my first experience just, so... Man, just, gah. Good job, man. Do I believe in a second chance? Sure, I do. And Rafael has just, you know, brought that message home to me. And he brings it home to every person who has a certain perception of what a serious felon is. Rafael requires that you revisit those assumptions. Welcome, Judge Mitchell, Rafael, Mrs. Cabrera. Rafael, I would like to present you with your discharge card from parole. Congratulations on successfully completing your parole. Thank you. Um, it's an honor. You are officially a free man. Good job. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I just asked the powers that be, man. To share the same kind of love that they gave me. The same kind of opportunity that they've given me to be here today to other people. You know, there's a lot of people there inside that deserve another chance. It is a day that in all candidness, I wondered if it would ever come. As a former prosecutor who has sent people to prison for life, I am very aware of the fact that most remain in prison for life, particularly for 1st degree murder. So there was always something that I felt conflicted with when I would communicate with Rafael. On one hand, I wanted to give Rafael hope that potentially, he would be released. But there was always that voice in the back of my head saying, "That probably isn't going to happen." For him to not only get a date, make it past the governor, make it past all the reviews that are in place to make sure that someone who shouldn't get out, doesn't. To see Rafael get out, perform well on parole. I mean, I, I still have to pinch myself to convince myself this is real. All right, guys, let's go! - Okay, thank you. - Okay. Good morning. It all boils down to this moment. Getting that medal. So... Ready to get out here and run this race. Do my best, you know. I'm not worried about the time. I just wanna finish and get the medal. I don't want to think about how difficult it's gonna be in the rain, and any of the obstacles that lay ahead. I just, I'm focused on finishing, and... Um, I feel pretty confident that I will. I'm actually more concerned about some of the other guys in the race, uh... Eduardo, uh, he's only ran eight miles in his life. He has no idea... ...what a brutal beating this is gonna be. I got a good night... I got a good night's sleep, man. I went to bed relatively early. I think I was in bed by ten. I know Tom's sick, and... Ryan's knees are gonna explode at mile marker two. So he's just going to run until he needs an operation. So, hell, I'm gonna go out there and run it as fast as I can. Just go out and run it, run like a maniac. Gonna need leave a little tip, of course, for the, the maid. Her name is Valerie. Italian lady, she's real nice. So, me and my Mom were talking a little bit earlier, that, before she used to go to visit me in prison, she used to spend the weekend at a motel. And, um, now, we're on a weekend in a hotel in Italy. Like, who would think of it? Who would know that, who would believe that this is gonna happen? And then before I put my shoes on, I want to put LP on here. For, um, the kids in juvenile hall. Los padrinos. Because I'm... I'm running on behalf of them too. Good luck on your marathon, Mommy! People question, why are you spending this kind of money to take people halfway around the world. Pope Francis, many years ago, did essentially the same thing in Argentina. He would take poor people who did not have an opportunity to travel outside of Buenos Aires and give them a holiday, a trip to the ocean, which they had never seen before. Pope Francis observed that by making this type of investment, giving people an opportunity that they would not otherwise have, to travel, to see things that they hadn't seen before, would give them dignity. And that word stuck with me. "Giving another person dignity." Giving someone from Skid Row an opportunity to come to a glorious city is incredibly empowering. It gives them dignity. And that's what this is about. Being on the other side of the world, you know, running in an international marathon, lifetime experience, you know. Get to tell this to the grandkids one day. Your granddaddy was in Italy running a marathon. I came out here with a vision, with a purpose. I just took it all in, you know. Just to see the work of Michelangelo, live, you know, up close. It was beautiful, you know. It was breathtaking and very inspiring. Somebody told me the other night, it's like you're coming up on four years. Boy, you got everything back fast. I don't know if it's come back fast or not. If I just snuck off, pounded a glass of wine, came back, no one would know. Well, yeah, you would, because I'd be the naked guy fist-fighting someone at three in the morning out here. And I would lose the friendship and the support of everything that's happened in the last two and a half years. And old me wouldn't give a rat's ass and then get berserk and violent and lose my mind and end up in jail and psych wards behind that. But my life is so much better today. My life is one billion percent better than I could have ever dreamed. This is all a, like, a turn-around for me in my life. I took somebody's life. I keep trying to give back, trying to make up for it. And they say that I don't have to do that, but I feel that as long as I'm breathing, there's not enough that I could do for the life that I took. I just think about my son, and, uh... you know, like, I want my son to dream big too, now. You know what I mean, like, he can... We can stop the cycle now, you know. And, um, it's just, it's such a big deal being here. It's not just about homeless people running in Rome, you know, like, it's, uh... it's about all the people at the Midnight Mission and all my friends, and, you know, my family. And they're just watching this, and it's inspiring them. It's such a big deal. Grazie. Grazie. Yeah. Each marathon that I run is a little bit more difficult. And it forces me to confront the fact that... you know, how many more years can I run alongside the 20, 30, 40-year old runners from the Midnight Mission. Whatever sacrifices I have made to make this possible in terms of time, and energy and expenditures, it's worth it. That's what I wish people would understand. If you just give a little of yourself. Once in a while, drop an encouraging word. Make a phone call on behalf of somebody. Sometimes, that's enough. "The admission committee carefully reviewed your application, audition, and accomplishments both musical and academic, and concluded that you would be a wonderful addition "to the Conservatory." I'm accepted. I'm in. That's pretty fucking phenomenal, right? I didn't do this on my own. I had the support of a lot of people. This is not a one-man effort by any stretch of the imagination. Yeah. Come here. Excellent. Keep Becca in your thoughts and prayers today. I got two job offers in Seattle. One for ambulatory surgery and one for labor and delivery at two prestigious hospitals in Seattle - Hey. - Beautiful. And I decided to take the labor and delivery job, and I start, uh, July sixth. - Amazing. - Yeah. I just want to say thank you so much for all that you've done. You're amazing. I'm very proud of you. Okay. This is a big step for me, cause I haven't really had a full-time job in... Wow, since like 1998. I'll be working in Culver City at this drug treatment facility. I'll be a tech, like a advisor, passing out the medication to the clients and taking vitals and stuff like that. So, I won't be painting as much but I will be painting on the weekends, and any other time I have some free time. My job will help people to save, uh, water, save power. And, like, if they save energy, then the whole world really saves energy, just, not only the state and the county. So everybody comes out a winner. Every other weekend, I'm here to drop off some family and friends that have loved ones here. That's what they've got to go through, you know. Wait in line right here and go through all this. Just trying to help families, you know, do the same thing, that they were doing to my mom and my family when I was incarcerated, and they helped them with transportation. Ben Shirley is what this group is all about. Turning your life around. A lot is said about his talent, and he's going to the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. But at the end of the day, it's your quality just as a good human being and a good friend. Okay? That is what makes you very important in my life. Okay? God bless you. Okay? - Yeah, right! - Yeah! Yeah! Come on. No, I'll still run. And off we go. Sweetheart, good job. Anyone who is involved in people who are in recovery, this is an aspect of it that you better be prepared to deal with because not everybody succeeds. In fact, the numbers would suggest that not even half of those who make initial efforts to get clean and stay clean are successful. Mody is highly intelligent, good soul, but he's a captive to his addiction. If and when, and I'm sure it will happen, he will reappear, we're gonna be there, we're not gonna pass judgment. We're gonna support, and you just hope that... time number six, time number seven, is going to be the magic one.
