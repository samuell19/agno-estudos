David Steele was my father. Peter. I'm so sorry, Peter. So sudden like this. Thank you, Mr. Hearst. They said it was a drunk driving accident. Unfortunately. I hope they catch the guy. Just terrible these days. There was no other driver. It was a one-car accident. It was a tree. Oh. Oh. Oh, well. I should probably go. What's this? Your dead father's ashes. I know what it is. Why do I have it? It's normal for the remains to travel with the family for the final resting place. Oh. Can you hold that? Good morning, Peter. Did we get a callback from Westchester? How are you? Remember, like we've been working on. Good morning, Stephanie. Did we get a callback from Westchester? Eye contact. I just wanna know you're trying. That phone is hilarious. You're looking mighty fancy today. What's the occasion? My father's funeral. So I'm expecting to get a callback from Westchester today. Stephanie? Stephanie, no. No, Stephanie. Please, please, please, please, please, please. Do you remember when you cry, I get a call from Paul in Human Resources, and then I have all that paperwork to fill out. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know, I'm not good at this. I know. It's okay. Don't you wanna take the rest of the day or anything? No, I'm fine. I just need to leave in a few to check his house out and figure out what to do with it. I will be able to be reached on my cell. You mean your house. No, I haven't lived there for years. So what? You're gonna go pack up old childhood memories, and look at old family photos. Westchester let me know if they call. You have 12 new messages. This is a message for David Steele. Message deleted. Message deleted. Mr. Steele this is Leonard Wolfing at the county assessor's office. - We have important. - Message deleted. Message deleted. Well, I'm sure you got a lot to think about right now. - I'm sorry to bother you. - There's nothing we can do about that. I'm afraid not. As such, none of this is really in order. But the good news is it's all pretty straightforward. Your father kept things pretty simple. He had a small equity line which you'll cover easily if you choose to sell the house. I'd like to just sell it as soon as possible if I can. I understand that you probable wanna get back to... I'm sorry where is it you live? Queens. Sunnyside. That close, huh. Why did I think it was Chicago or someplace like that? Have you been around recently? No. Alright, excellent. Well, as I said, you have a house to sell. He had a few small assets, retirement savings, checking, but really no other major assets. He had a small line of credit card debt and a car loan. But little things here and there. But all and all the market value of the house you should be able to clear a comfortable sum after fees etcetera, so. Did he have a will? - Excuse me? - Is there something I have to sign? No, I'm afraid not. You have to forgive me this is not my area of law. I'm not really doing this in any official capacity. Essentially, as the only child with your mother predeceased, you're the only person with a claim to the assets. Hey, Peter. When's the last time you saw him? Has he paid you? What is your fee in all of this? Oh, no, I'm doing this as a friend. No charge. Is there anything else I can help you with? Actually if you know anyone in real estate to show the house. I'll have my assistant give you a list of agents. Thank you. He was proud of you Peter. Did he mention me? Well, sometimes words don't... Thank you, Mr. Hearst. You wouldn't happen to know the latest tax assessment on the property, would you? No. And the plumbing and electric are they the original? I don't know. Did he do any measure of work recently? Any work orders or permits? No idea. Alright, I see. Well, based on comparables, you could probably see high fours or maybe just over 500,000. Good news for you is that you're entering a hot season. Come spring and summer families are looking to move. They wanna get their kids into better schools, and this neighborhood is great for that. So if you rip out the carpets maybe a fresh coat of paint on the walls, you could probably list it at 525 maybe even 550. What are we looking at as is with furniture and everything? Uh, well. I would list it at 475. You'll get some people in the door. Let's do 450. Are you sure? You'd be leaving a lot of money on the table. I'd just like to get this over with. Would you be open to rentals... - No. - To get it occupied? I understand the memories must be difficult. Very difficult. - Mr. Steele I'm calling from - Have a nice day. Northshore University Hospital Outpatient Services. We just wanted to confirm with you the date and time of your appointment. Please be sure to arrive 15 minutes prior to the scheduled time to update paperwork. - Hello. - Mr. Steele? Yes, can I give you a different address and phone number. I'm not gonna be checking my father's house regularly. Excuse me? I figure you have insurance forms and bills from the hospital from the accident. I was looking for David Steele. That's my father. Is this not about his accident? Right, David Steele is listed as the family contact for Francis Steele. Mr. Steele, are you there? This is Peter, Peter Steele. David Steele is my father. He's deceased. I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Steele. Francis Steele, Frank. Are you calling about my Uncle Frank? Yeah, that sounds correct. Mr. Steele your Uncle Francis Steele receives outpatient treatment on a regular basis. Your father would routinely bring him in for his sessions and take him home. He's unable to drive himself. I didn't know Uncle Frank was alive. Be that as it may, Mr. Steele, Francis Steele is scheduled for his outpatient procedure tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. Is there some other member of the family I should be having this conversation with? No. No. Just me. Will you be able to bring Mr. Steele in for his procedure tomorrow? Yes, I can. Okay, thank you. Please remind him that he should not have anything to eat or drink after midnight. I'm gonna need an address. We're located at 1000 Plaza Drive, Building Four. I'm gonna need my uncle's address. Don't you usually wear shorts? Excuse me? Where's the package? Mia, hey, you have to ask. You have to ask who's at the door. Sorry, sorry about that. How can I help you? I'm looking for Frank Steele. Yeah, two floors up, 4P. I buzzed this apartment, right? Yeah, yeah. No, people have to buzz here 'cause he broke his buzzer three times. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Congratulations. - What? Your shirt you're pregnant. No, this. No, it's laundry day. Oh. It's fine. It's totally fine. No, it's totally fine. How come you're here to see Frank? I'm taking him to the doctor. Doesn't someone normally come by and take him? They're kind of loud, sort of mean? That's my father. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sure you just have to get to know him then it's great. No, actually you don't need to get to know him. He's dead. - Jesus. - No, it's all right. - I'm so sorry. - It's all right. - It's all right. - Okay. This is one of the most awkward conversations I've had in a very long time. It is not the most awkward one I've had this week. Really? My father died. Yeah. Bye. Yeah, I'm coming. Frank? - Uncle Frank? - Yeah. Peter it's David's son. I know who you are, and I don't like the beard. The hospital called. Yeah, where's your father? Where's your father? I'm sorry we didn't reach you. - Who's we? - Me. Me, I'm sorry I didn't reach you. I didn't know how to reach you. Reach me? Yeah, I didn't have a current address. I've lived here in this apartment since you were 12-years-old. Yeah, right, sorry. Besides, I wouldn't have been any use to you anyhow. You could've been at the funeral. Oh, God no. Don't get me wrong. But when you get to where I am you go to a funeral, feels like the barbershop. You hang around long enough and you're a mess with a cut. That's funny. No, it's not. Right. About the only privilege to being old and sick you get to do whatever the hell you want. People stopped telling me what to do. Sounds pretty good. You want something to drink, anything? I'm fine. Good, 'cause I'm pretty sure this is my last one. The hospital said you shouldn't have anything to eat or drink. What's it gonna do, kill me? Maybe. Let's go, on your feet. You know where the hell you're going? Yeah. What? Nothing. Nothing. Mr. Steele. Whoa, what are you doing? You getting a shot back there today I don't know about. Sit down, kid. I don't need you to hold my hand back there. So where are you taking me for lunch? Lunch? Yeah, lunch what'd you think you were gonna just drop me unceremoniously back at the house? Yeah, right. Lunch. I don't really know any places around here. There was only one place your father and I could agree on, a Chinese joint up by my house not far from me. What, you got a problem with Chinese? You afraid to get a little rice stuck in your beard there. Sounds great. Hi. What's this? That's his. He gets the paper here? The guy from the newsstand next door banned him. Do you know why he was banned? Shoplifting couple of times. If that ain't anti-Semite. You're not Jewish. So what can I get you? Listen, kid. You think you can run to the OTB place a few bets for me? Why, you get banned from there too? That one was complete BS. Yeah, the food here is terrible. Best to just stick with the soup. So let me know when the next appointment is... Don't worry about it. You sure? I said don't worry about it. I'm a big boy. If I need to get there, I'll figure it out. Okay, but. Do you wanna know what this is? Yeah, you? It's a G. At least I think it's a G. I've only had two lessons. Mia, don't be terrorizing the building. Go practice in your room. - Hi. - Hi. Hi, hey, how was the doctor? Weird. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's so kind that you're taking him. I don't think he needs me. Well, everyone needs someone, right? I mean to say I don't think that he wants me. Probably means that he needs you even more. When is your next appointment? Thursday. We're eating someplace else. No we're not! Are you with Mr. Steele? - Yes. - Come on back please. Is he almost ready? Yes, they're finishing up with him right now. He should be out shortly. I just wanted to address a few concerns we have regarding his treatment. Do you know if he's been taking his medication on a regular? No. No, he hasn't, or no you don't know? What about his diet? How about that how's that been? Mister? Steele, you can call me Peter please. Mr. Steele how long has it been since you last saw your uncle? Years. Are you familiar with Acute Myeloid Leukemia? Just from the pamphlet in the lobby. Well, I'm afraid we're past the point of treating his disease, and now we're in a course of pain and symptom management. He's terminal? I like to put it this way. We're reshaping what time he does have left. How much time is that? Well, that's where it gets tricky. If he takes his medication, comes to his treatments, and stays relatively healthy, he might have a year or more. But if he's not taking his treatment seriously, there's simply no one of telling what he's in for. I appreciate that. But I don't know how to communicate with my uncle. I don't know how to talk to him, and even if I did, I'm pretty sure he wouldn't talk. Mr. Steele, I'm not here to judge. I'm certainly not in a position to have a philosophical debate about how he lives his life. I just thought I'd try to enlist your help on our side. I mean no disrespect, but how do you know how he should approach his treatment? I understand, Mr. Steele. I just thought it warranted your attention. How about bone marrow? Bone marrow? I read in the pamphlet that there is treatments. I'm afraid we're past that option. Could I have been a donor as a relative of his? We would've started there. You know, I have some information in the lobby that explains all that to you, you want me to grab it for you? No, there's no point. You always breathe like that? You know, you can talk. You can talk to me. Do you really think you're dying? Okay, we don't need to talk. I mean, does it feel like you're dying? That's what I've been told many times. Do you believe it? I feel like shit everyday. Some days worse than others. I realized one thing. I am going to die sooner rather than later. You talk to anybody other it? Your father. Did he say anything? Your father had qualities. Emotional support wasn't one of them. I think, we all have those moments. What do you mean? When you're lying there staring at the ceiling wondering how it's gonna end. Is this it? Is this the beginning of the end? Or am I thinking that because I don't know what's next? Maybe you're the one that needs to get checked out. When the end comes, I'll know it. You seem very sure of yourself. And I hate it when I'm right. Is there anything I could do? - No. - Can I do anything for you? No, I'm pretty wiped out after these things, and I just wanna lay down. Can you? Can you? What? The medicine they give me. I hate it, and they want me to take it like every night. It's supposed to help with the bruising and the clotting and staving off infection. That's good. No, it makes me sweat like a whore in church. My sheets. Say no more. Please. It'll just be a few more days. I will text you the house number, and you could forward all calls there. Thank you, Stephanie. - Hi. - Hi. Hi, again. You're still at it. Well, yeah. She has this lucky pair of socks now, and she has to wear them every time she has a math test. She has a math test tomorrow, so. I use to have an owl shirt that I loved. First thing I wore out of the wash every time. So you understand the gravity of this situation. Kids are so weird. I was 27. Mrs. Sloan? Mrs. Sloan, this man was using that machine. Doesn't look like it. He's standing in front of it with laundry. What else would he be doing? Maybe he was taking his clothes out of the machine? He's not. Do you even live here? He's helping Frank. Do you know Frank? He's on the fourth floor. He's really, really sick. He's helping him out he's doing his laundry. Isn't that so nice, you know, people helping people, love thy neighbor? Community building that's what it's all about, right? We are the world. We are the children. Bye, Mrs. Sloan, have a great day. Thank you for saving me from the sweet looking lady. Oh, no problem. Mrs. Sloan has just approved of my existence ever since the single mother moved in with a slightly loud little girl. I kind of feel like if you can't play off the level of contempt she has for me, then I'm sort of missing a comedic opportunity. I'm trying to be nice to Frank because I'm straying from my usual path. Oh, what's your usual path? You ever do anyone else's laundry? Are you kidding me, like one T-shirt in here is mine. What's he doing now? Frank? - Mm-hmm. - He's sleeping. You have somewhere to be while you're waiting? No. Well, do you wanna come up while you wait? I don't wanna be a bother. Okay. It's not trouble? No. No, it's really no trouble at all. I mean, I don't know how much stuff I have in the house. But I have coffee, a nice collection of herbal teas. I don't have anything stronger, I'm sorry. I don't really drink anything stronger. Oh, you know what though. I have just the thing to soothe the weary soul. I can't get it to. You are very good at this. Yeah, well, there's a real learning curve here. I mean, I think, that if you stopped Donkey Kong, you could be a very formidable opponent. I like the snack table. I haven't seen one of those in ages. We haven't eaten dinner in our actual kitchen table in like 10 days. Do you wanna go again? Sure. Why is that? What? Why don't you eat at the table? She's gotten really into Monopoly recently, so the table is covered in this huge sprawling game that we started a week and a half ago. I admire the commitment. No, no, no. It's gotten really out of hand. We don't know whose money is who's. We don't even know whose property is who's. It's really more about keeping the game alive at this point than pursuing victory. That seems to run counter to the whole capitalist spirit of the thing. Yeah, well, she's seven. She likes the different colors of the money. Right, right. So do you live around here? Not far. How come I've never seen you around before? I haven't been around before. Oh. - Actually... - No, no it's fine. I really didn't wanna pry. Doesn't feel like prying if we don't make eye contact. Okay. It's kind of like confession, like a kid in church. Not quite comfortable with where that puts me, but okay. So you're around now. I haven't seen my family in years. Then I got the call that my father died, and now I'm here. Helping your uncle. Well, my father was the only one there for him, and I don't think there's any other names on that list after mine. How long had it been since you were last around? Seven years. No, eight years. I'm sorry. We were not close. Well, fathers can be challenging. I hear some fathers are nice to watch a ball game with. Or go fishing. Sometimes I like to think that he and I didn't have enough time to find the thing, our thing. Definitely didn't know the last time I saw him would be the last time I'd see him. I thought you guys didn't play this without me. I'm sorry. I know. I know, I promise this was just the one exception. Hi. - Hi. - I heard you play violin the other day. Can I take your picture? Sure. My parents got her this camera for her birthday last month and she's obsessed. She wants to take everyone's picture. My mom got me a telescope when I was her age. I used to ask all the adults to look through it and tell me what they saw. - Really? - Yeah, it turns out adults don't really know anything about constellations. So there was a lot of awkward conversations. Did the telescope eventually go away? Tell me it went away. I'm like really on the brink of needing this camera to go away. I used the telescope every day for years. Great. There she is. Do I say cheese? Act natural. How? So. Just like act natural. Act like you normally would every day. I'm trying. This is nerve-racking. Is that it? No, that was just her turning it on. Did you do it? Thank you for inviting me in. Yeah, of course. Hey, how's he doing? I have no idea. Okay, well, anytime you ever need to kill time, just knock on the door. We're usually here. Thank you. I'm Peter by the way. I'm Melanie, hi. Hi, Melanie. - And that is? - That's Mia. - Mia. - Mm-hmm. It was nice to meet both of you. You too. Hey, did they call that prescription in for me from the office? I think so. You think so. You know what thought did? What? He shot his pants but only thought he did. I don't know what that means. My mother used to say that to me all the time. You never met her, did you? No. I was probably for the best. What is that? That is a picture of me. - What? - I was about to ask you a question then I realized I should probably know the answer already. What do you mean? Did you ever have a family, kids, wife? Nah. No kids, thank God. Could you imagine? I was married once? Really? Yeah, two years. I met her overseas and brought her back here. God she hated it here. Never should've happened. I was a kid it was stupid. This was years and years ago right after your mother and father got married before you were born. But nothing after that? Nah. I make the most sense alone. Your father did too, to be honest. What do you expect we were practically raised by wolves. I don't remember our old man saying two words to us. That's the God's honest truth. Nah, alone, kid, just the way I came in. - Hi. - Hey, Melanie. Are you free for dinner tonight? Is it a sinner? Yes. - I'm sorry. - No, no, no. Don't be sorry. Alright, I got five more questions. She's making her communion so she has all these little assignments it's like a whole. Hold on M-O-R-T-A-L. I just have to make a call. Can you wait until I put her to bed, like 8:15? - Yeah. - Cool. So I'll meet you out front at 8:15. - M-O-R. - Yeah. - Wait. - T-A-L. You have serious work to do. - Thanks. - What's purgatory? Good luck. - Oh, hi. - Hey. - Hi, sorry I'm late. - No trouble. You okay? Yeah, you look great. Thanks. So where are we going? What if I told you that I don't know any restaurants in the area except for horrible Chinese? I would say that I don't go to any restaurants that don't have crayons on the table. What can go wrong? Alright, we'll figure it out. Thank you. Is your chair okay? Yeah, it's just. - It's okay. - Wobbly? No, they didn't put it. The table's at a weird. It's okay. So, what do you do when you're not doing laundry? This is always a crowd pleaser. Alright, here we go. I do telemarketing for web and SEO services. You call strangers and sell them web services? Yes, is the only accurate answer to that question. How would you get interested in that? I'm not. I'm really not interested in that. I mean I don't think anyone who does it is interested in it. Basically, it's just a job. I needed a job when Mia was born. I wanted to work from home. I couldn't really bear the thought of leaving and leaving her with someone and getting a regular job. So, I got this one and then I was there for a year. And then that became two years. Yeah, they do let me pick my own hours. They pay for my phone and internet. Basically, I sold myself to a huge corporation for the price of a laptop and a phone to plug in. Everyone does that. Yeah. You're making it work. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, hope I end up somewhere better. I keep thinking it'll get easier as she gets older. But, she's seven. What'd you do before her? Nothing. Nothing, I didn't do anything. Well, I was in school. I was a student. I did have a part-time job folding sweaters at the Gap. - Ooh. - Yeah, wow. This was not the plan. What was the plan? I wanted to be an art teacher. I always thought that seemed cool. You could still do that, right? Yeah. Technically, yeah, I would need a lot more credits. So the idea of going back to school, but also having a job so I can pay the rent and keep the lights on it doesn't seem possible at this point in my life. She seems awesome? Mia, yeah? Yeah. She is a lot. She's a lot all the time. She kind of just like throws everything at you all at once. I mean, she asks me. The questions that she asks me. I would actually not like to talk about Mia tonight if that's okay? I just spend basically all my time thinking about her and making decisions for her and then questioning the decision and beating myself up over every little thing - about her, so. - No, Mia. - Understood. - Yeah, thank you. Thanks. You already had a question about her. - Right? - No, it's okay. Go ahead. - You wanna know if... - She has a father? Yeah. Is that always the question? Always the question. So, yes. Obviously, Mia has a father, right. She wouldn't like recognize him. If she ran into him on the street, he would not recognize her. They've never met. He left before she was born, which sounds awful. But really, I mean, it's not like he said he was going out for milk and then never came back. He ended it face to face. He was as humane as you can be. It was rough at the time. But it's been seven years, and I've lived every single day without him. And I can very safely say that he made the right call. For him, yes, probably. For us, definitely. I mean, I don't think it would've made sense or been good for Mia if we had just kind of like stayed together and pretended like that was the plan. I'm sorry, this is a lot. No, it's okay. I just wanted to at least get to desert before giving you my sob story. I don't mind listening to you. I'm glad you don't mind listening to me. Listen, I'm feeling a little exposed to be honest with you. I feel like I just gave you all my emotional baggage all that once and I don't know anything about you. Can you just even if it out. I don't really have anything. Just something weird, something weird about you or something embarrassing. - Anything. - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. - Okay. Great. When I take a shower, I usually wash my face last. Sometimes I get so caught up in my train of thought, whatever I'm thinking about, that I don't remember if I washed my face yet or not. So I'll stand there, water beading down on me for five whole minutes, debating with myself whether or not I should wash my face again if I hadn't, in fact, washed it before or if I should get out of the shower not having washed my face at all. That was the worst. That was the worst. That was the worst. Yeah, I just bared my soul to you. I just told you about raising a kid on my own and about my thwarted dreams of being an art teacher. You are telling me about washing your face or not washing your face in the shower. It's not my fault you went first. How did you know that's so weird. So, when do you sleep usually? I don't usually. Do you wanna hear the routine? - Yes. - Okay. I get Mia off to school at 7:45. I get a couple of hours in then. Then I do the phone for a couple hours. Then I'll do some housework or whatever until she gets back, and then she's back. So we do her homework. We watch a TV show together. We eat dinner, bath, story, bedtime routine. Get her off to bed. Put my little headset on that's for dialing. I'll try to squeeze in a couple more hours of sleep then because she wakes up for breakfast hit or mess. - Wow. - Yeah. I know, I've moved further and further away from any kind of normal routine the longer I've done this. You're doing it. You're on your terms together. Yeah, I don't know. I wish I could say that this was all some conscience act of defiance to choose to live outside the mainstream thing. Whatever, but this is just the job I have. Most of the time I'm on autopilot. You're on a different level. You're making decisions for another person. I don't even make decisions. I'm just carrying out actions, muscle memory: eat, sleep, work, that shower thing I told you about. No one tells me to do anything. But, what am I doing? I'm impressed. Believe me, I make it look very hard. I make enough to pay rent to keep our place, and then my parents pay her tuition at Catholic school. And once a year they'll take us on a little vacation. That sounds nice. Yeah. Yeah, it actually is nice. Most of the time I'm able to look past how disappointing the state of affairs is for all of us. We did not envision this as our set up. Your daughter has people who love her. Someone's always there for her. Yeah. A lot of nights though I end up just wide awake watching shitty TV or staring at my computer screen or whatever. I find 3:00 to 5:00 a.m. to be a difficult time. I'm back at my father's house. I'm sleeping in my childhood bedroom. It's creepy. I can't seem to get to sleep. But for some reason I keep going back. You grew up here? - Yeah. - Hmm. And I moved. And? And, my mother died when I was nine. So it was just my father and I. We'd see Uncle Frank on holidays sometimes, but for the most part it was just me and David Steele. He pretended to keep it together pretty well until I was about 11. It wasn't happy, but it wasn't bad. We greeted each other. We exchanged pleasantries. When I think about it now, I shouldn't have taken it personally because he was just dealing with everything, this new world without her, as best that he could. But I did. I took it personally. When I was 13, we openly acknowledged the fact that the house was a miserable place to be especially when we were both there, and so he instituted a new rule. You don't have to come home on Fridays. "In fact, don't come home on Fridays" that's how he said it. And it seemed like a good idea at the time. You know, we both were looking for something like that. So, I had this one friend, this one good friend, this one friend, Matt Rockcamp. We were the tech guys in the school play. We'd do the soundboard and the line board and all those switches. And we had play rehearsals on Saturday mornings. So Friday like clockwork, we'd go to Matt's house after school. We'd watch Monty Python movies and order pizza and sometimes we'd sleep on the screened in porch that he had. In the morning, Mrs. R would wake up and make us bacon and eggs and these homemade cinnamon rolls, not even from the can. You could put on all the icing you wanted. When I have any fun inkling of that age, that's what I think of. But, of course, the worse is when I went home after play practice. My father would smoke these cigars and always have the TV glaring like four bars too loud. I remember getting in the front door and catching that smell and hearing the TV and just being so sad that I was back home. Then the only thing that was actually worse was when I'd get home and he wasn't there. And then Saturdays turn into Sundays. And Sundays turned into Wednesdays. And he was gone more and more. Now Frank is dying of cancer. And Matt Rockcamp I heard that he moved to Seattle, and he's an architect now. I think, you're doing a really good job with that little girl. I can't believe you told me that shower story while you were sitting on that. This was fun. Yeah, thank you for coming out. Oh, my god, thank you are you kidding me. I never have a reason to actually leave this apartment building. I like invent reasons to leave the building. I go to the store, get something I already have, or go to the Post Office for new stamps. I don't know I take Mia to the park. She doesn't even like going to the park anymore. I'd go to the park. It's a little late, but maybe another time. Yeah. So I can't invite you up. I'm not gonna invite you up. - No. - Sorry to just say that. I just wanted to be direct because I feel like Mia's upstairs, and if she were to hear us come in. She'd get the wrong idea. You don't want her to bring strange men into the apartment. Questions, I don't wanna deal with her questions. Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna head home and get some sleep before I have to drive Frank in the morning. Okay, rest up. I will. Stop by tomorrow if you want after the doctor. - Goodnight. - Thank you. Goodnight. So was how was treatment today? What did they tell you about me? Nothing. Don't play dumb with me. What did they tell you about me? They asked me again if you were taking your medication and how you diet went. What are you gonna want a stool sample next? I didn't say anything. You know, I've lived my life on my terms, and I'll see it end on my term. Okay. It is okay. Why won't you at least try? You know, your father never gave me shit about this. He did it the right way. No pain, no suffering, no lingering in the hospital. Just enough Scotch to make the lines blurry. The tree does the rest. What? Nothing. You don't know how long I've been doing this? How many doctors, how many treatments. I get bent out of shape over every instruction, and then what the hell am I supposed to do. I listened. For a long time I listened. I just can't. I just can't listen anymore, and I would kindly ask you to respect that. When I don't even care enough at this point to do that. - Hi. - Hi. I didn't know you were here. Come in. What's up? My father's house? Would you want it? Are you kidding? No, maybe it would help. Peter, I can't afford a house. What if you didn't have to worry about that? Okay, there's a light switch outside my bathroom. It's like one of those pull light switches, and it broke months ago. And I just leave the light on. All the time it's always on. So I can't take care of a whole house. And also Mia's in school, so we can't just like move. Of course. Of course, you're right I'm sorry. Are you okay? I should probably go. I'm sorry to bother you. I was knocking for like 15 minutes. I was wondering where you were. I thought maybe, huh? I was dead? Getting ready to turn it over with this, kid. Come on we gotta get going. - Pass. - What the hell do did you do in here, Frank? It smells like you took a dump in here. But you'll never find it. Hurry up, come on. Or what? You're not listening. I'm not going anywhere today or any other day for that matter. You're doing really well, Frank. No, no you're doing really well. You got a nice little record of on-time deliveries, and I'm sure the doctors are all so very proud of you. It's a game. It's just a game. I'm not even a player. I'm a piece, I'm a pawn. Move him there, move him here. Give him this, try that. And I realize I have one move left, and I choose not to play. I'm sorry you're not feeling well, Frank. Don't you dare. Don't you dare pity me. I was dying before you walked in this house, and I'll be dying when you walk out. On your feet we're going, Frank! Or maybe I'll get lucky. Or maybe I'll just be dead. I'm not just gonna sit here and watch you die. Then go! I didn't ask you to come here. I didn't ask you to take care of me, and I'm sure as hell not going to ask for your permission. Why are you doing this? I'm not doing it to you, kid. Peter. Peter, this is Kevin and Renee. This is their second look, and, I think, I'm pretty confident to say you got serious buyers here. That's great. I'm so glad you popped in, Peter. They were asking me, but I'm sure you know better. How are the schools in this district? I don't really know. I have to I'm sorry. You know what kid you're really starting to piss me off. I was at my desk. I was at the office working on an email when the phone rings. The call came in that he had died. I didn't have an answer to what it's gonna be again? One afternoon the phone rings and that's how I find out it's over. Come on what you think that by being here it's not gonna happen. You're getting that call, kid. One way or another you're getting that call. I don't want that. So what are you gonna do put a mirror under my nose every time I go to sleep? Where are you going? Well, you're here, right? Take me to the store I need stuff. Oh, hey, where are boys going? To the beach. You wanna come? Please, mommy, please. We're gonna eat clams, french fries, milkshakes. Please. You have homework. Just a little and I take pictures. A little favor for a dying old man. Works every time. I thought you had to get stuff from the store. Better opportunity presented itself. - Hi. - Hi. We're here. You okay? Yes. Mommy, they don't have my booster seater here. Yeah, well. You're gonna have to make an exception this time. They keep these kids in their car seats until their wedding night. When I was kid, we didn't have car seats. You sat in somebody's lap with somebody who smoked, and they blow that smoke in your face. If the car hit a bump, you banged your head. You turned out just fine. He's just mad at me 'cause I'm dying. Mommy, is he really dying? That's not such a good question to ask. Because they don't want you to hear the truth. Who's getting hungry? - Me. - Great. Let's go. What the heck? I'm taking pictures of the ocean. Yeah, but why are you taking so many. It's all the same. Because I wanna get all of it. But you can't get all of it, it's huge. Well, maybe I can get most of it. Okay. What do you got there? - My wallet. - Oh, yeah. How much you got? 11 bucks, one five and six ones. Oh, yeah, let me show you something. See, you take your money. You take your big bill, your five. Then you wrap the ones around it. This way when people see it, they think you only got a dollar. Otherwise they see a big bill, they'd knock you on the head and they'd take it. Mom, are they really gonna knock me in the head for my money? Thanks, Frank. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Have a clam. It's good, huh? When I was a little boy, I use to come here with my brother and we would dig them out of the wet sand and eat 'em raw. Ew, really? Oh, yeah, it's the best way to eat 'em. One day couple of years ago I was digging, and this bozo comes up to me. He says, "The fishing rights on this beach are protected, "and you can't do that." So I said, "Oh, yeah. "I'm a veteran and I" Frank. Child. What did you do? I stopped. Well, that's good. You wouldn't wanna get in trouble. What's going on with him? He didn't go to treatment this morning. He said he doesn't wanna go anymore. Sorry. Then he told me to leave. So you grabbed him and brought him to the beach? No, I left. And then you came back. Okay. Okay, look, Peter, I know you're trying to do something good here. - I get that. - Believe me, he's said that earlier. You have to let him choose now, whether you like it or not. Why? Why does he get to choose? Because it's his life. He's my family. Can I stand idly by and watch? I think, it's time maybe for you to start saying goodbye. No, no. No one's asking you to save them. Is this about what I said about the house? I mean, sort of. You come in here and you act like you wanna save the day. I mean, to be honest with you it's a pretty obnoxious idea when you really think about it. He is a human being. We are human beings. We have dignity. We're trying to make the best of what we have. We don't need your judgment. I never judged you. I don't judge him. But you can't invite me into your lives then ask me not to touch anything. I'm not a child. I finally have some power, some ability. - Finally, I can do something. - Jesus! - I could change things. - Peter, no. You are not that powerful. You don't have a magic wand that you can just wave in the air and make all the bad stuff go away. So what do I do? Nothing? Be careful, okay. Be careful thinking that you have the answer to something that isn't your question to begin with. Alright, it's time to go. All right, bye guys. Take care of yourself, Frank. Yeah, that was good. I had fun. I haven't been to the beach in God knows how long. Glad you're happy. Yeah, that's where I should go. You just went. No, no, that's where they should bury me. You know, not bury me. Scatter me, you know like when they burn you? Cremate? Yeah, cremate me. Cremate me. But scatter my ashes on the beach. Let old Frank get lapped up by the ocean I would like that. Hey, kid, what's up? The house sold. Mm, good, good for you. You get that money. After bills and such it's really not that bad. Well, good, you deserve it. Now put it to good use. I'll think something. I should ask you if you wanted anything anything of my father's from the house? Nah, besides what would I do with it now? I'm sorry, Frank. What are you apologizing to me for? Well, a lot of things. Now you don't need to be sorry to me. Thanks, Frank. You're a good kid. You go home and get some rest. Take care of yourself. You too. I'll see you around, kid. Hey, Peter. We missed you around here. It is good to be back. We were all thinking about you. Thank you. You know, it's times like these you need family the most. Definitely. Stephanie. How are things? Are things okay? Yeah. Thanks for asking. Hello, Peter. Hey, Kid. What's up? I got a call from the hospital. They said you made an appointment, but you needed your kid to pick you up. Yeah, I didn't know how to get a hold of you, so I figured the hospital could track you down. Your kid? I actually said that kid with the dirty beard. You must have changed it. I don't wanna go just yet. Okay, we can just hang out and then. Yeah, that's good. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Starting to think I did this all wrong. What do you mean? All this. I thought I could do this my way. You know, when they find my body in a couple of week, when the mail piled up and the stench reached the hallway. Now I'm thinking that wasn't such a good idea. Take a deep breath, Frank. It's gonna be okay. Listen I'm trying. It's hard. I know, I'm here. Thanks, kid. Remember what I told you about how when the end is coming, I think, I'll know it? And what did I say? I hate being right. Frank. I don't know. It just hit me the other day. I didn't know what to do, so I called the hospital. I couldn't think of anything else. Hey. Frank. Frank, look at me. Frank. I'm glad they got me. Thanks, kid. Frank Steele. Want me to go to the store and get you something? No, I just need to. I just need to sit down. You know what help me up. I need to go to bed. Okay, I got it. Can you get me some of that soup I like from the place? Yeah, I can go and get that. But not right now. I'll wait until you fall asleep. Thanks. What do you know, kid. I guess, I was wrong. You just gotta get some rest, Frank. I gotta hand it to you, kid. Your old man was a rat bastard. But you are all right. You turned out okay. You said it yourself. He should've been alone. Nah, screw that. Nobody should be alone. Anyone who says that it's a cop out. It's easier just pushing people away. Sounds like you're getting soft in your old age, Frank. Maybe. - Hi. - Hi. Can I come in? I'm sorry. I should've said that sooner, but I didn't. And it was just because I... You were trying to help. Yes, I don't know the first thing about helping. I don't know the first thing helping someone especially like you. To be truthful, I don't know how you do what you do. I wouldn't know a normal family dynamic if it hit me in the face. And I came in here and just. Hey, you were trying to help. I'm not very good at that. How's Frank? Frank is. I'm sorry. He is full of surprises. I never thought there was a difference between wanting together be someone and just not wanting to be alone. I've been alone, and I don't know if it's because I've wanted it or just because I just haven't done anything about it. Yeah, I know what you mean. Mom. Oh, hi, Peter. Hi. Thanks for all the great stuff. I'm glad you liked it. I hope you put it to good use. Come on I have the telescope all set up. It's too bright out now. But later we'll see lots of stars. Do you know any of them, any of the constellations? I had a book when I was a kid that had all the constellations in it. And there was a list that I'd cross them off with whenever I identify them. That's sounds awesome. Okay, we'll get you the book. I told you we'll take care of it. I'll go get my camera. Okay. Thank God she has not stopped bugging me about this telescope since she set it up. She wants this chart. She wants this book thanks to you. I mean, she basically wants to survey the entire universe. Hobbies die hard. You know a lot of people think that you can't see anything through a telescope during the daytime. But that's not true. Even where we were in the time of day. There you are, hello. That's Venus. What? - No way? - Yeah. I can show you. Okay. Now do you see that little crescent to the left of those clouds? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. That is Venus. That looks like the moon. No, no. That to the right much bigger that is the moon. Huh? - Really? - Yeah, really.
