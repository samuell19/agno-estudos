It's like a giant strobe light... burning right through my eyes. Somehow I can still see. Children look like burnt paper... black... not moving. And then the blast wave hits them. And they fly apart like leaves. Dreams of the end of the world are very common. It's not a dream, you moron. It's real. I know the date it happens. I'm sure it feels very real to you. On August 29th, 1997, it's gonna feel pretty fuckin' real to you, too! Anybody not wearing two million sunblock is gonna have a real bad day. - Get it? - Sarah... God, you think you're safe and alive? You're already dead. Everybody. Him, you! You're dead already! This whole place, everything you see is gone! You're the one living in a fucking dream! 'Cause I know it happened! It happened! There once was a future in which humankind was hunted by a machine that could think and Terminators built to kill. A future without hope. That future never happened because I stopped it... ...to protect my son and to save us all. No! No! No. No! Once I saved three billion lives... John! ...but I couldn't save my son. John! A machine took him from me. And I am terminated. Are you okay? Okay, okay, okay. Thanks, lady. You just saved our asses. Don't thank me yet. Hey, little brother. Good morning. I brought tamales and atole. Well, if you want to be big in America, you would say...? I'm going to pass Bruno Mars... pronto? Good. - Let's go. - Okay. Uh-huh. Let's go, Diego. We're running late. - I had something going there. - Yeah. - I saw it. - Come on. You think I was flirting with her too much? I think all the parts where you were talking were too much. Funny. Dani? Mmm-hmm. Hey, hey, hey! There's a new guy at my station. I see that. Robot. Señor Sanchez, what's going on? Diego. Sí. I'll go. - Take my spot. - No, no, no. Dani Ramos. How's the game? Please, Mr. Grummond. It's my brother. But, Dani, he ain't you. What's next? 3,000 people out there. What happens if I tell them they're just keeping a spot warm for some machine? That is not your father. That is a machine that was sent here to kill you. - Let me go! - You come with me or you're dead in the next 30 seconds. Come on. Who are you? I'm the person saving your life. Dani! Go, Dani. Stay behind me! Hey, lady! Grace. My name is Grace. That won't kill it. - We gotta go. Move! - What? - Go! - Diego! To where? Keep going! Come on! Here. This way. Come on! Hey! Please! Can you tell us what that thing is? It's a Terminator. A Rev-9. He was sent here from the future. I was, too. Get in. Get in! Are you a machine, too? No, I'm human like you. But, uh, your arm... I'm augmented. - What? - Augmented? Fuck! Shit! Oh, shit. No! Faster! Go faster! I know you're scared, but I am here to protect you. Why us? You, Dani. You're my mission. Me? No, no, no! Look out! Go faster! Go faster! Fuck! No! No! Oh, my God! No! Drive! - What? - Can you drive? - No, I mean, I can't... - I can! I can! Yeah. Hold it. Grace... Dani, put your seat belt on. Diego... Grace! Help me! It's Diego! Please! Take him out. Dani. I can't. What? No, no! Don't. He will bleed out. Señor? Diego. - Dani, we have to go. - I'm not leaving him. Take her. Save her. - No! - I'm sorry. Please! No. - Diego! - Dani! Dani! Dani, stop! Why did you do that? We have to go, or he died for nothing. - No. - Come on. Diego! Oh, shit. When they start to kill me, run. What? I'll be back. Who the fuck is that? I don't know. But we have to move. Go. We can't just... - Grace, it's that lady's car. - Dani, you go or it kills you. It's that simple. Son of a bitch! Dani... I need some water. If we can maybe look in the back. I wanna go home. Take me home. We're not doing that. I have to tell my father about Diego. It's not possible. He doesn't know about Diego. I need to see my father! Your father is dead. What? It needs physical contact to copy people. And they don't survive. No. No. What's wrong with you? I'm crashing. You're burning up. My metabolism was tuned for short, intense bursts. You either stop a Terminator in the first few minutes... or you're dead. I need meds. Hey! Grace! Wake up! Where are you going? Get back in the car. I have to protect you. You can't even walk. I'm going to the police. You do that, it'll find you. You put a hundred cops between you and a Terminator... you'll get a hundred dead cops. Dani, please. Wait. Come here. - You said you can't drive. - Yeah. I'll figure it out. Hey! Hey! Grace, Grace! It's okay. We're here. Fuck, you're heavy. We're here. Grace. I need any anticonvulsant. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate, insulin, benzodiazepine... Do you have a doctor's prescription? Here's my prescription. What are you doing? Fuck it. Move. It's okay. Grace. Grace. Grace? Grace. I save your ass... and you steal my truck. Nice. I... Never mind. It's burnt. What's wrong with her? I don't know. She's sick or something. Well, I need answers from you two. So let's get her in the car. Give me that before you hurt yourself. So, who are you? Um, Daniella Ramos. Dani. I'm nobody. Well, Dani, you must be somebody, or they wouldn't have sent whatever she is to protect you. Hey, you got a phone? - Yes. - Could I see it for a sec? Hey! Might as well be wearing a tracking bracelet. When I'm ready to kill that thing, then I'll let it know where we are. We should have done this in the bathtub. Have you seen the bathtub? Uh-uh. I keep my cell phone in the chip bag. The foil blocks the GPS signal so they can't track me. Who's trying to track you? I'm wanted in a couple of states. 50, actually. But why 10 bags? Because I really like potato chips. Her meds... how do you know how much of each to use? I don't. No one will know who he is. Who? My brother. He was in the truck when... Who will be there to bury him? Or my father? No funerals. No one there to say goodbye. Funerals don't help them. And goodbyes don't help you. You just have to learn to live with it. Come in, base. This is Dragonfly Three requesting close air support. We are five klicks out, carrying wounded precious cargo. Over. Roger that, Dragonfly Three. Be advised there are hostiles inbound on vector five. The trauma crew is standing by for the commander at the south tunnel. We have Rev-7s in pursuit. Weapons free. Let's move! We got 30 seconds. - Get off there now! Move back! - Go! Incoming! You get the commander inside. Okay. You three, with me! Hold them back! Come on! Look out! We're being overrun! We need reinforcements now! Cover her! Move! Coming in! Shit! She's got multiple stab wounds. A lot of chest trauma here. Let's get these holes sealed up. Get a chest tube in the right side. - This is gonna hurt like a motherfucker. - Wait, wait. No! - Here. - No, no! I need to protect your commander. The commander is safe, thanks to you. Don't worry, soldier. You'll make it. I volunteer. Make me an Augment. Midline sternotomy with manubrial splitting. Lung deflation and cardiac localization. Okay, let's gear up. Sarah? Talk. Talk fast. You first. Get off me. Sarah! Hey, Sarah! Open the door. Dani! - You okay? - Yeah, you okay? Yeah. What happened? Locked me out of the room? Sometimes mommies and daddies have to have grown-up discussions. So you're here to protect her. What are you? Never seen one like you before. Almost human. I am human. Just enhanced. You know, increased speed and strength, thorium micro-reactor. Which means I can rip your throat out if you piss me off, so don't. When are you from? 2042. Your turn. My name is Sarah Connor. When I was about her age... a Terminator was sent to kill me to stop the birth of my son, John. Leader of the Resistance. Which resistance? The human resistance. Against Skynet? The AI that's trying to wipe us all out? I've never heard of it. Good. John and I changed that. We changed the future. Saved three billion lives. You're welcome. Where's your son now? Skynet had sent several Terminators to hunt him. One finally caught up with us... and carried out orders from a future that never happened. Since then... I hunt Terminators. And I drink till I black out. Enough of a résumé for you? No. How did you know we'd be on that freeway? Interview's over. We gotta move. We? There is no "we." Dani's with me. It's my mission to protect her. Oh, yeah? How's that working out for you? Clearly you don't know everything about this time. How anyone with a phone is a walking sensor platform. How every intersection, every gas station and 7-Eleven has cameras. Nobody walks through this world without leaving a digital trail a mile wide. And my guess is that Terminator hunting her can access that data anytime. You two won't last 10 hours. Let's get something straight. If you put her in danger or you get in my way, I will fuck you up. Right. I drive. So, that machine... who sent it? I can't fight it if I don't know what we're up against. It's a Rev-9 model. You don't fight it. You run from it. Yeah, but who sent it? Not who. What. And it wasn't some... Skynet thing. In the future that actually happened... it's called Legion. Legion. An AI built for cyber warfare. Those assholes never learn. And it attacked. - Attacked who? - Us. Everybody. Humanity. Sarah, how did you know we would be on that bridge? I get these texts. Precise GPS coordinates, dates, times, down to the second. They always end with the same two words. "For John." So I pack up every weapon I've got, and I head to those coordinates to kill whoever is messing with me. The air splits open above a parking lot and a Terminator drops out. So I destroy it. And then two years later, same thing. Location, time, date, "For John." I frag that one, too. And last week, I get two texts, both in Mexico City. Did you ever find out who sends those texts? No. They're always encrypted. Do you still have them on your phone? Dani. What are you doing? Future shit. What's wrong? What is it? These texts came from outside Laredo. Two days ago, my commander had them tattoo these coordinates on me. As if I couldn't remember shit. Told me to go here in case anything went sideways with my mission. It's the same location your texts come from. Whoever sent you these texts is the same person I was told to go to for help. What does it mean? It means we're going to Texas. You wanna cross the U.S. border with an undocumented Mexican national and a woman who had her own episode on America's Most Wanted? I know someone who can get us across. Someone you trust? Yes. My uncle. Well, we need to ditch the car. Get off the grid. Why do you care what happens to her? Hey, ladies. Because I was her. And it sucks. Let's go. Well, this is off the grid, all right. But I wish it wasn't so crowded here. Well, I wish you two weren't so white. Let's go, chicas. Gracias. Grace, tell me what happens when this all falls apart. Nothing happens. There's no warning. Day one, everything just stops. No phones, no power. Cities go dark. Grace, stay there. They told us we had to leave, just until things got back to normal. But normal was never coming back. Day two, they launched nukes. They thought they could contain Legion with tactical EMP strikes. And by day three, the whole world was at war. Millions died. And then, when the food ran out, billions. Some men killed my dad over a can of peaches. I'm sorry. When we thought the worst was over, then Legion started to hunt survivors. We know you got food, kid. Give it up. I don't know how I made it through the next few years. I just try not to think about it. But I got lucky. Someone found me, saved me, and then we started fighting back. And let me guess. Dani gives birth to the one man that can stop it. - What? - The future wants you dead for the same reason it wanted me dead. But I'm nothing. I'm nobody. Yeah, you're not the threat. It's your womb. Fine. Let someone else be Mother Mary for a while. If you're Mother Mary, why do I so wanna beat the shit outta you? Dani! My clients get across safely. To a better life. I don't leave them to die in the desert as some others do. Can you get us across the border? Forgive me, but gringas are not my usual clientele. You two do something illegal maybe? Something my Dani doesn't wish to say? Tío, there's... This is going to sound crazy, but there's a machine out there. A robot. It's what killed Papi and Diego, and it wants to kill me. We have to get away from it. That's a new one. Grace is part machine, too. This way, ladies. Hey, fellas. What's up? Ain't that just like the Border Patrol. Five minutes late, and neglects to bring us donuts. Terrance, shut the fuck up. Griffin 33 in contact with intersection due west of the Greene Bridge. 9-11 Griffin 33 wilco. Griffin 339-11, that is your target. Almost there. One more kilometer to the river. Wait. Take cover. There's a drone up there. I don't hear anything. Yeah, well, you're not an augmented super soldier from the future, are you? We have to hurry. Attention, all patrols. Be advised, new coordinates issued. Suspects are now 220 meters south of Checkpoint 7-Bravo. They are known members of the Sinaloa Cartel. Wanted by American and Mexican authorities. They should be considered armed and dangerous. Deadly force is authorized. When you reach the wall, there's a door beneath. Flacco will show you the way. I will go first. Oh, shit. Stop! U.S. Border Patrol. Put your weapons on the ground. We get locked up, it comes for her, she's dead. I'm not gonna tell you again! Put them on the ground! Okay. Dani! Dani! They can shoot me, but I'm not watching you die. It's okay. If they separate me from her, - please get her out of there. - All right. Walk forward and away from your weapons. Get on the ground! Get up, move it. - You get them? - Yep. We have one male suspect and three female suspects in custody. - Dani! - Hey! We need help here! Sorry, but I don't have time for this shit. And it's not my problem. I need basic information. Name, age, country of origin. It's the truth, ma'am. I swear it. This machine, it killed my brother and my father, - and now it wants to kill me, and he... - Uh-huh. Please! Officer, you have to believe me. You're in danger, too. No. I'm in Processing. You ought to save your story till you get where you're going, honey. Heart rate slightly elevated. Lungs are clear. Let's get that wound exposed. Trachea's midline. Let's check for any exit wounds. Nice body search, fellas. What is that? I've never seen anything like this. Let's get some pictures. That's confirmed. We have eyes on it now. Go ahead. Hey. I just got TDY'd here to pick up a new detainee. - Where they being held? - Check in with the desk sergeant. - He'll direct you. - Thank you. Evenin'. Supposed to pick up a detainee. Dani Ramos. Please locker your weapon. What's been done to her? How is she even alive with all this stuff in her? Expect a big ping, brother. My whole body's a weapon. Save it for the ladies. Sorry. Metal hip. Two tours in Afghanistan. All right. Thank you for your service. Psst. Connor. Sarah Connor. I'm Officer Rigby. It's an honor. Hey, guess what. You're famous. And we don't get a lot of famous around here. Let's go. You belong in your own private cage. I want to go, too! Hey! Catch her! Did I say you can look at my private parts? Where do they take the new prisoners? They're called detainees and we... They're taken to the south end holding area for processing... Thanks. Right this way, ma'am. Our senior living section is on the second floor. Hey! Grace! Grace! - You okay? - He's here. We gotta go. Get back! Everybody, get back! Come on. Get in! We gotta go. There's Sarah. She's coming. - There's no time. - What? No! I'm not leaving her! Dani! Sarah, run! - Sarah, get her! - Get in! Dani, you need to understand something. You can't do stupid shit like that. You cannot put yourself at risk. - He would have killed Sarah. - That doesn't matter! When are you gonna get it? Everybody dies if you don't make it. She's right. What? Hey there, fellas. Y'all come to see the shitshow? What the hell happened here? Detainee got loose, unlocked all the cages, just chaos from there. I don't mind tellin' you, I prayed more in five minutes than I have my whole life. Heard that. Say, you boys know where I can get my hands on a chopper? We're over the coordinates. Land a klick short. So, Carl? That's the plan? Carl's the mystery texter. No! No! Sarah Connor. Sarah! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! What the fuck are you doing? - Let me have it! - No. Sarah, you need to calm down. That thing killed John! - Is that true? - Yes. But I'm not what you think I am. I'll kill you, you motherfucker! Sarah, Sarah. - If this man can help us... - Not a man. A Terminator. Shoot him in the face and see what's underneath! I don't care what he is! Please. - So you're a... - Yes. Cyberdyne Systems Model 101. May I ask what you are? No. Sarah? I don't have a photograph of John. I never took any. I thought that... they couldn't find him... if they didn't know what he looked like. But now I'm forgetting his face. I'm sorry. So why is the girl targeted? You don't need to know. Well, can you at least tell me how you found me? Who gave you that? Thanks. - Please sit down. - Cut the shit. Nice family. She a Terminator, too? That's your little Terminator kid? His name is Mateo. I met his mother, Alicia, a few months after I killed John. Oh, you don't get to say his name. Ever. Her husband had beaten her. He was trying to kill her child. She had nowhere to go. Caring for this family gave me purpose. 'Cause without purpose, we are nothing. Touching story. Does it have a point? While raising Mateo, my son, I began to understand what I had taken from you. Wait. You grew a conscience? The equivalent of one, yes. It's an infiltrator. It's lying. When my mission was completed, there were no further orders. So for 20 years, I kept learning how to become more human. So what about the texts? When chronal displacement occurs there's a shockwave through time measurable before the event. That's how, not why. To give you purpose, Sarah. I thought it would bring meaning to your son's death. You know what would give meaning to his death? No, Sarah! This will be very hard to explain to Alicia. It's a Terminator! And we are fighting a Terminator. One that we can't stop. Do you believe in fate, Sarah? Or do you believe that we all can change the future every second by every choice that we make? You chose to change the future. You chose to destroy Skynet. You set me free. And now, I'm going to help you protect the girl because I choose to. That's Alicia. She needs my help with the groceries. - Hi, honey. - Hi. We have company. Company? Who? Was there enough hot water? - Yes, thank you. - Thanks. Here you go. Carl, your friends look hungry. Would you like some sandwiches and chips or something? That's a great idea, Alicia. Mateo, why don't you go and help your mother? Sure, Dad. I'm on it. So, you're Carl. That's what everyone calls me, yes. I'm never gonna fucking call you Carl. They don't know? - No. - She hasn't noticed that you weigh 400 pounds? That you never sleep? Our relationship is not physical. She appreciated that I could change diapers. Efficiently and without any complaints. I am reliable, I'm a very good listener and I'm extremely funny. Okay. How do we stop this thing? We choose our weapons and our ground, we set up a kill box, and then we use Dani to bring it to us. - What? - And then we take it down. No. No way. Dani is not bait. Sarah is right. Our one tactical advantage is that the Terminator only sees its mission. Wherever Dani goes, he will follow. Damn right it will. And I will be there. Well, I'm not about to stake her out like some goat for you. What's your plan? More running? My plan is to hide her at the bottom of a mineshaft if I have to. - At least until I... - Just stop it! I'm not hiding at the bottom of a mineshaft. I'm not gonna live in fear the rest of my life. Even if your plan means that might not be long. I want to stand and fight. So, we choose our weapons and our ground. We're gonna set up a... - Kill box. - Kill box. And then, we're gonna use me as bait. And then, we kill that thing. Okay? This plan has a high probability of success. Okay. What weapons? You just keep these around? Even without a rogue AI taking over, I calculate a 74% chance that human civilization will collapse into barbarism. And in that eventuality, these weapons will be vital to protect my family. Also... this is Texas. Go. Rapid fire. You're anticipating the recoil. Put your weight forward, arms up. And wider stance. Don't lock out your elbows. Enough of this bullshit. Let's get serious. A Terminator has just killed your whole family. What do you do? You know these guns won't kill it. They'll only slow him down. According to your description of his capabilities, our best option is to secure a military-grade energy weapon. An EMP? What is that? An electromagnetic pulse. If we had one close range, it would fry a Rev-9. I might know a guy. Air Force intelligence officer out of Bingham. It's 94 miles from here. We should leave this afternoon. Okay. You've been tracking me? If you want to keep your phone in a bag of potato chips, then keep your phone in a bag of potato chips. Take good care of Mama. I will. You're gonna be okay. What did you tell them? I told them you coming here makes this place unsafe for them. Also, the day I warned them might come, has come. My past has caught up with me. And... I won't be back. Do you love them? Not like a human can. For many years I thought it was an advantage. It isn't. I'm sorry. I just want you to know that when Dani's safe and this is all over, I am going to kill you. I understand. There's much more to it than just picking the right color. It's the texture, the weight of the material. - One wrong choice... - Sarah, you okay? ...it can destroy the look of the entire room. - Fine. - There was this one customer that came to me. He wanted to have solid-color drapes in a little girl's room. I said, "Don't do it." You need butterflies, polka dots, balloons. Stay put. Always good to see you, Major. It's never good to see you, Connor. You got my birthday present? You know, Sarah, I don't commit treason for just anybody. What's the range of the EMP against a Class Four hardened target? Bodyguard? I do drapes. He's part of my operations team. And he should just shut the fuck up. Major, what kind of helos fly out of Bingham? Black Hawks and Chinooks. Why? He's found us. Take cover! Major! We're in. Go. Head for the base. About two miles down this road. It'll be on us again in a minute. This is Major Dean, 361st Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Group. Declaring THREATCON Delta. I'm currently two miles south of Bingham Air Base in a white van. Headed for the west gate. Pursued by hostiles in a stolen police helicopter. Where are we going? Can't all those soldiers back there help us? They'll be able to slow it down, but they can't kill it. The C-5. Can you fly that? Of course. You are entering unauthorized airspace. Turn around now or we will open fire. Get ready. What the hell? Stand down! These people are district contractors. Friendlies. I'll do what I can to cover your backs until you can get airborne. Hey, they're not clear! Stop 'em! We have been reacquired. Take cover! Don't touch me. I'm out. Carl! Sorry about your shed. Bridge 42, this is Viper 16. Stay in tension. Hopefully they won't shoot us down. Noble Eagle Ops, this is Viper 16. Where are we going? Figuring that out next. But those Humvees are rigged for parachute landing, so we can punch out and then find some remote spot to use the EMP. We have a problem. So, if we fight him without those, can we win? Based on the weapons we have, I estimate our chances at 12%. That's not zero. It's not much better. Then we have to find some more weapons and we stick to the plan. - We set the trap and then we can... - No, Dani, you can't do that. Why? Because my son is supposed to save us all? And until then, what? We just keep watching people die? The future of the human race depends on you making it... I don't give a shit about the future. Or what I'm maybe supposed to do someday. What matters are the choices we make now. I've seen that look too many times before. You knew me. In the future. Yeah. I know you. It was you... who found me in the ruins after Judgment Day. You saved me. HKs. Shoot me, and we'll all be dead in 10 seconds. This is what Legion wants us to do. Kill each other. We should be fighting the machines. What's the point? We can't win. Legion didn't exist until humans created it. We made that thing. We can destroy it. Are we supposed to lie down and die because some machine decided it? Is that our fate? Well, fuck fate. What's your name? Grace. Grace. I'm Daniella. Dani. You saved me and you raised me, and you taught me to hope. Like you saved and taught the others. You turned scavengers into militias and militias into an army. We rose up out of the ashes and we took our world back. You taught us there is no fate but what we make for ourselves. Dani, you are not the mother of some man who saves the future. You are the future. That's why Legion wants you dead. She's John. You're John. I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before. But you told me that the Dani I'd meet in the past couldn't handle it. But you're not that Dani anymore. Delta Echo 12. This is KC-320. Ready to refuel. Acknowledge. Copy that, KC-320, but aren't you a bit early? It's him. We gotta go. Now. Strap in to the Humvee. Grace! Dani! Dani! Fuck. Open the cargo bay. I'll get Sarah! - Sarah! The door? - It's jammed! Get the straps. Shit! What's happening? Grace! Where is she? I don't see her. Oh, fuck. Got two more. They're bringing 'em in. Guys! What the shit? Oh, my God! Grace. - I thought you were dead. - We're dropping too fast. Three, two, one! - My God! - Oh, shit! Dani, get out. - It's blocked! - It's not gonna hold! Hold on! No! Sarah? - What is it? - My shoulder. It's dislocated. So you're a doctor now? Fuck! He's coming. We can't stay here. Oh, shit. What is she doing? No, no, Grace. Really? Strap in! Right. Otherwise it could be dangerous. Try to find the lights. Get down! There's a parachute back there. Grab it. We can tangle him up. Listen to me. It comes, you pull this cord. This cord. And then you swim past it up to the surface. Okay. Okay. Grace. Where is it? I don't know. I lost him. We can't stay here. We gotta go. All right. Can you make it up there? I don't know. It's locked. Let me try. Grace. Wait. There's maybe another door. Shit. Grace! Dani, you have to run. - You have to run. We can't protect you. - What? I'm the only one of us who can still throw a punch. There's another weapon. What? My power source. How do we get it out of you without killing you? - You can't. - No! What? You look terrible. At least I still have all my face. You left this on the plane. I can't get through that door. Come on! Hurry! We have to move. He's not far behind. No. We make our stand here. This is our kill box. Dani. I'm not running! Give me the girl. No. You really should. You and I were built for the same purpose. And Legion is the only future. I came from a future like that. It failed. I know she's a stranger to you. Why not just let me have her? Because we're not machines, you metal motherfucker. Grace! Hey! Hey! I'm over here! Move. Sarah! Move! Where's Grace? I don't know. Oh, there she is. Grace! Grace! Are you okay? Grace. Sarah! It's not dead. Wait. We gotta take you out of here. Okay? Grace, let's go. My power source. Get it close, and it'll fry his neural net. Grace... I can't. Yes, you can. Dani. This is what you sent me here to do. No. We both knew I wasn't coming back. - I can't. - Dani, please. You saved me. Let me save you. - Please. - No. You do it. Do it, Dani. I'm sorry, Grace. I'm not. I'm gonna kill you, fucker. Hey! Get up! Help her! God damn it... Carl! Wake up! For John. We got him, Grace. You saved me. Grace! Grace, come on, honey. It's time to go. Come on, you two. Grab your stuff, you guys. I won't let her die for me again. Then you need to be ready.
