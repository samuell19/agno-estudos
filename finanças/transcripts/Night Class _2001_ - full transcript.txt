(dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - Physical evidence. Physical evidence is by far the most important element when prosecuting a crime. That might be cellular material like DNA or blood, or as simple as a fingerprint. Whether we find that evidence or not is up to us. The bottom line is this, how well we do our job means the difference between a criminal going free or being prosecuted to the full extent of the law. The forensic evidence is out there, people. It's up to us to make sure we find it. Almost as important as physical evidence is the existence of one or more witness. I say almost because most witnesses are unreliable. Often times they misinterpret or miss what they saw. Even more important, a good cop, like you will all be, would be able to describe every person in this room after one quick look. A good cop would be able to make each and every one of you. Your weight, your height, your race, accurately and dispassionately. And even a bad cop would be able to notice Mr. Franklin, once again, leaving our class before the bell. Your assignment, Mr. Franklin. - Yeah, sorry, I'm kind of in a hurry here. - All right, guys. That'll be it for today. (light music) - [Woman] Hey! - [Man] Taxi, taxi. - [Jake] I'm sorry, Ma'am, after you. They say hindsight is 20/20. Hell, take it from me, that's the understatement of the century. All right, before you jump to any conclusions about me or what I'm doing with my life, just let me explain what happened. Hey, Slim, cover for me? - Yeah, right, you're too late. Warbuton's already here. - The man should get a life. - You should get a watch. The Brink's truck guy has been out there for 10 minutes. - Hey, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. Here you go. Hey, Mr. Warburton, I'm sorry. I got stuck in traffic again. - I'm trying to run a hotel here, Franklin. Not a halfway house for the irresponsible. - [Jake] Yeah, I know, I know, sir. Class ran a little later than usual. - The Brinks truck was waiting over 15 minutes. - Yeah, well, the 405 was backed up again, you know. - I'm writing you up again, Franklin. This will be a second warning for your personnel file. - Well, it will not happen again, sir. I guarantee that. - It better not. I'll meet you back here at the hotel at 4:30 in the afternoon sharp. Now, go about your rounds, if you please. - Excuse me, can I help you? - I was just looking for a way out. - Oh, no, no. No, that's like administration and catering. The lobby is right through there. - Actually, my ex-husband is out there, and despite a restraining order, he won't leave me alone. - Oh, well, I'll walk you out. - Well, it'll still be a scene either way. Isn't there another way out? - Yeah, you know what? I'll show you. Here, come on. Yeah, so this staircase right here will take you right up and out. - I really appreciate this. - Oh, that's no problem. Actually, you know, I'm not really what I'd appear. I mean, you know, a security guard. Well, you can come back after I graduate. I'll arrest that guy who's been hassling you. - You're studying to be a cop? - Yeah. Yeah, getting a degree in Police Sciences. - Well, I wish you all the best. - Thank you. Hey, you know, if you ever need help with this situation, I don't know, I could like give you my phone number. - That's very sweet of you. - So that's a yes? - That's a thank you. Officer J. Franklin? - Jake, Jake. - Goodbye, Jake. - Goodbye. Forget it. Idiot, idiot, idiot. (faint radio chattering) - [Murphy] Didn't her hanging around the office arouse your curiosity? - Well, like I said, she looked like she was lost, you know? - Well, she obviously knew the position of the camera. All we can see is the top of her head. We're about finished here for now, but I'd certainly like a copy of that video as soon as I can. - Absolutely, you'll have the videotape on your desk first thing tomorrow morning. - And if you can remember anything more about this afternoon, call me. - You bet. - I'll show you out, this way please. This is a disaster for the hotel. - I assume the hotel and Mrs. Graham both have the Vanderbilt heavily insured. - Yes, but this will be a public relations nightmare. Heads will roll! - You know, maybe you ought to beef up your security. - Yes, I will make note. You don't think he was involved, do you? - Well, generally robberies of this kind have someone working on the inside. - So Franklin is a suspect? - I wouldn't rule him out. - I thought so. Are you going to arrest him? - You can't arrest somebody for being stupid. - Yes, certainly. Well, our insurance will be in touch for your report. Franklin, you're fired. - For what? Look, I didn't steal anything! - I have guests to worry about. The police have just informed me that you are a suspect. I can't have you buzzing around here while you're under suspicion. - Look, Mr. Warburton, I need this job, okay? I mean, what am I supposed to do without a paycheck? - Why don't you find the lady with the jewels? She seemed to have been taken by you. - [Jake] Thanks for nothing. I don't know what it is about me and certain women. It's just that this time I was really screwed, and I couldn't believe that I let her do it to me. (dog barks) (dramatic suspenseful music) (siren wailing) - Okay, guys, that's it. And as they say in that TV program, be careful out there. - Mister Sheehan? - Mister Franklin, you're still here? Surely this must be a first. - Yeah, well, I actually don't have to be at work so early tonight. Look, I was wondering if maybe you could help me with something. Somebody stole some money out of my uniform, you know, at work, and it was in the same pocket this badge was on. And I'm just wondering if you could tell me if there are any prints there other than my own. - Latent prints? - Yeah. - [Sheehan] But don't you know how to do that? - Yeah, I do, but you know, I don't want to make a mistake. - This one is not yours. - All right, so how do I find out whose it is? DMV? - Yeah, well, that's where I'd start. If he lives in California, he probably has a driver's license. And if he has a driver's license, his fingerprints would be in the system. I can search most of this through the department's database. - Would you? - Your he would appear to be a she. Do you know her? - I don't really know. I can't tell. Can you print it out? - Sure, if you think it'll help. - Yeah. 1656. A mailbox? Fuck! (electricity crackling) (Jake screams) Jesus Christ, lady! - You're not such a big man now, are you, sick bastard? - Stop, stop, I'm sorry! It was a mistake! - You want some more? Police, police! - It was a mistake! (light suspenseful music) (objects rumbling) - Did I scare you? - No. I'm just gonna look around a little bit. - Yeah, yeah. - Listen, I'm interested in pawning that. - That's a nice watch. - I'm sorry, man, do you work here? - Yeah, yes, I do, I do. - So can you help me with that? - Yeah, yeah. (bell buzzes) - Why don't you go clean the sidewalks? - [Richie] Yes, sir. - What do you need? - Yeah, how are you doing? I'd like to pawn that. - You got a receipt? - No, actually, it was my uncle's. I inherited it when he died. - Dead uncle, huh? - Yeah. (bell buzzes) - Wetling Chronograph. - Is that the mark? - Yeah. - Lowball him, no more than 50. - Gotcha. 40 bucks. - 40 bucks? - Take it or leave it. - Look, that's worth at least 400, man. - [Shank] You can always try eBay. - Yeah, well, I will, thanks a lot. (light suspenseful music) - Morgan, could you give me a little space please? - Just looking after my investment is all. - Okay, you look after your end of things, and I'll look after mine, okay? - Really? You used to like it when I looked after your end. Hey! What the fuck are you doing in here? - Shank told me to come in and sweep up everywhere. - Don't ever come in here when I'm in here, is that clear? - Yeah. - Morgan, the cigar! - What? You want one? - [Jake] Hey, what's the matter? You lose your way again? - [Claire] What do you want? - Oh, you're not the lady from the hotel, huh? - I don't know what you're talking about. - All right. So how did your fingerprints wind up on my name tag? - You've got me mixed up with somebody else. - I've got you mixed up with somebody else, do I? All right, so this isn't you? That's not you? That's not you? - What are you, kidding? This says red hair, blue eyes. An idiot could tell you've got the wrong person. - You are so full of shit. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. - Is this clown bothering you? - No, man, come on. It's like a case of mistaken identity, man, all right? Just relax, all right? Just put that down. I thought she was somebody else, okay? I don't want any trouble here, man. It's just a big mistake. - Well, that's one mistake you almost didn't walk away from. Now get the hell out of here! Come on. - Son of a bitch! - [Operator] What city please? - Yeah, Los Angeles Police, the number of the LAPD. The 22nd Division please. - Downtown? - Yeah. - [Operator] Would you like me to dial that for you? - Thank you, thank you. (phone ringing) - Murphy. Franklin, the security guard. (laughs) Really? Well, tell me all about it. Uh-huh. A pawnshop? Hey, that's good work, son. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm writing it down as we speak. No, no, no, not really. No, we'll get in touch with you. No, not now. But thanks. - [Officer] Here's that background file you asked for. - Wait a minute. Put this with the inactives. - [Officer] Sure thing. - Anybody know a three-letter word for subseat? Anybody? - Hey, Slim. - Where have you been? I left you five messages. - I know, I know, I've been running around like an idiot. - You really screwed up this time. - Yeah. Well, thanks, Heather. It's always nice to know that I have your support. - Look, I got you that job, and now I've got to hear about it from Warburton every friggin' day! - Yeah, but you're backing me up, right? - No, actually, I tell him it's brothers like you that give nepotism a bad name. - That's cold. - Come over and hold this. - All right. Heather, I tracked her down. - Tracked who down? - You know, the thief. The lady with the necklace. - Look, Jake, I believe you. I know you're not involved. - You know what? I hate it when you do that. Just hear me out on this, okay? So I call the cops, and they just, they blew me off! - What are you talking about? - Well, I talked to this guy, Detective Murphy. He's like in charge of the case, right? - Yeah. - And he doesn't even want to bring me in. I mean, Heather, I'm giving him the whole case here, and the guy's treating me like I'm a nuisance call or something. - You don't think he's involved, do you? - I don't know, but there is definitely something wrong. - No, no, Jake, I know that look. You're in too deep, just stay away! - Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say. Anyway, listen, I've got a favor to ask you. This is my extra set of keys. Just do me a favor, hold onto them for a second, all right? - Jake, no, come on, now you're scaring me. - It's all right, I'm all right. It's all good. I'll call you in like a couple of days, okay? Anyway, I'm all right, and I'll talk to you, all right? You know what? - How much do you need? - How much you got? (light music) - I came here to tell you to stay away. And also to give you this. - So what, I'm supposed to be grateful now? - Look, I give you a lot of credit. You found me, you're good. But this is way over your head. There's $5,000 here. - I'm not taking a payoff. - Okay, call it what you want, as long as I never see or hear from you again, okay? - I don't want your money. (knocking on door) - Mr. Franklin? This is Detective Murphy, we need to talk. - Hey, hey, hey! Where are you going? - Jake, this is about the conversation we had earlier today. Jake, I know you're in there, and one way or another we're going to talk. We can do it here, or we can do it down at the station. The choice is yours, but make it now. Jake! Oh, shit! Vince, take the front of the building! (upbeat music) (people chattering) - [Jake] I didn't know what to do. I mean, this woman comes to my apartment, throws thousands of dollars at me. The cop's at the door, and I don't trust him at all. So I did the only thing that made sense, I left her lousy payoff untouched, and I went after her. Well, at least it made sense at the time. (knocking on door) Hey, Claire! If that is your name. Look, I'm not going anywhere here until you talk to me, all right? - [Claire] What do you want? - Could you open the door please? - I told you to stay out of this. - That cop, Murphy, was just at my apartment, okay? Now, if I would have let him in, he would've seen your dirty money all over the place. But he already has, right, 'cause you guys are like framing me here, huh? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Sure you do, sure you do. You and Murphy, you're like working together here, and I'm like the patsy, huh? - No, you're a dead man. - Fuck! Would you all just shut up for a second here? I'm trying to carry on a conversation with a jewel thief! Could you let me in here please? - I can't protect you anymore. - Thank you, don't mind if I do. - What do you think this is, a game? - Yeah, some game. Cost me my job, and now I'm a suspect in a felony. - Oh, come on. You're the worst security guard I've ever seen. - Excuse me? - You are eight minutes late to work every Tuesday and Wednesday. - You were watching me? - Every day for five weeks. - I never saw you. - Case closed. - Jesus, what did you, just wake up one morning and decide to ruin my life? - I didn't forget to lock the safe! - No, you didn't. Why didn't you let him kill me? - What? - You know, the goon down near the alley. Why did you stop him? - I don't know. - You know what? That's the first thing you've said that I actually believe. God, nothing about this makes any sense. - You know, that's exactly why you should stay out of it. Because what you don't know can't kill you. - Yes, it can. - Okay, it can, you're right. Now go. - I mean, you know, you could've had me killed, but instead you try and bribe me. - [Claire] I should have had him kill you. - Yeah, but you see, you didn't, and you even tried to protect me. - And that's exactly why you're leaving. - No, no, no, no, I'm not. I'm not going anywhere until you give me some real information. - [Claire] And if I don't? - I go to the Feds, then I go to the Press. - [Claire] And do you think I'd let you do this? - You're no killer. (phone ringing) - Yeah? The guy in the alley who nearly whacked you is my partner. We're going to sell the necklace to a dealer, steal it back, and substitute it with a fake. So you see, in the end, we'll have the necklace back, and then we'll talk. Do you have a car? (suspenseful music) - Okay, I had no idea what she was talking about. But she convinced me that if I helped her, Mrs. Vanderbilt would get her necklace back, and I'd get my name cleared. Was I a little naive? Maybe. But let's face it, I wasn't exactly thinking with my head at that point. Hey, hey, hey! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! What do you want me to do? - Just wait here. - All right. (dog barking) Come on, come on. - You want coffee, Ned? - What did you say, honey? - [Roxanne] I'm going downstairs. Do you want coffee? - Yeah, I'd love some. You know how I like it: hot, black and sweet. Hey you. What do you say after breakfast we go back upstairs, pick up where we left off. - You're feeling pretty frisky this morning. - You have no idea. - Ow Ned! Jesus Christ! Look what you did! - Hey, on you it looks good. Hey, you, come here. - Stop it, Ned! Stop it! I'm not in the mood anymore! - You're not in the mood? Okay. Clean it up, I'll see you upstairs. (Roxanne screaming) - [Shelly] What the hell is all the racket? - [Roxanne] Something touched me, I think it was a mouse! - [Shelly] Jesus! - Fuck, come on already! Jesus, I thought something happened to you, you know? - Drive! - All right, all right. - What the hell are you doing? Slow down! - Slow down? - You're gonna get us killed driving like this! - Well, I thought you were in a hurry here. - I am in a hurry, but do you see anyone chasing us? - Oh. - Just drive. - All right. (camera snapping) - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... I'm really sorry, I didn't mean to do this. (phone ringing) - How many times have I told you not to touch the merchandise? Now pick up the broom, and get your ass back to work! - Yes, sir. Do you want me to go out and get you a cup of coffee or something? - Fifth Street Pawn. Yeah. Yeah, as far as I know. I'll tell him. If it ain't good, he'll call. Yeah. Bye. (bell buzzes) Morgan, that was Shelly. He says he's got the money, and tomorrow's still good. - Good, you tell him it was good? - Yeah, I told him. - Good, hey, kid, get me a coffee, will you? And none of that Domio MochaPanzie shit. You know, regular God-damn American coffee. - Yeah, yes, sir. - Whose nephew is he anyway? - [Shank] Claire, boss, I don't know. - Jesus Christ. (light upbeat music) - I guess I'll wait here. (light upbeat music) (siren wailing) - Piece of cake. - So you want to tell me what that was all about? - Just a little insurance. - You really like keeping me in the dark, don't you? - Yeah. - Well, I'm sorry, I don't work that way. - Let's go home. - Oh, you mean like to your place? Well, all right. - [Morgan] You're sure he'll go for this? - [Claire] Uh-huh. - Boy, I'd love to see the look on his face when he tries to dump the copies. - [Claire] He's gonna know you made the switch. - What are you talking about? It could have been anybody. Every fence in the world knows he's into hot rocks. - Well, don't bet on him not coming after you. - Hey, stop making me crazy, all right? Just make the God-damn switch. - Don't worry. - You know something? - When somebody tells me to stop worrying, that's when I start worrying. Jesus Christ, I'm beginning to think I'm the one that's gonna get screwed here. - What would make you say something like that? - It's just a feeling. - Stop worrying. It's gonna be you and me all the way. - All the way, huh? - There will be plenty of time for that later. Let's not put pleasure before business, okay? - You just make sure you don't put anything else before business. You hear me? - You know, you can really be an asshole sometimes. - You check the necklace before we left? - Claire did it. - You sure she didn't make a switch? - What kind of a stupid fucking question is that? - Well, how do you know? She-- - Shut the fuck up, will you? - Gentlemen, say hello to Martin Holden. - How are you doing? - Gentlemen. - Sufficient light for you, Martin? - I think it'll be just fine. - Shall we do some business? - That's what we're here for. - Brilliant. (light suspenseful music) Well, Martin? - Well, I'm a little surprised actually. - Martin, you know how I hate surprises. - It's excellent quality. Flawless D color stones. Among the finest I've ever seen. - Thank you for your time and expertise, Martin. Always a pleasure. - The pleasure is mine. - Take it easy. - Big T., the vault please. Mr. Pizza Man, it seems you do deliver. - Surprise, surprise, huh? - $2 million, unmarked bills. Enjoy the count. Thank you, gentlemen. Always a pleasure. (upbeat music) - Here, make yourself useful. - I told you I served time. - [Jake] Yeah, but you didn't tell me you were a noted gemologist. - That's irrelevant. - It's just I'm trying to figure out why somebody with your credentials would be involved with these lowlifes. - Come on, you're driving. Ned Shelly is about as corrupt as they come. - All right, so Cary Grant sent you some hot stones. - I found out everything he gave me was hot. - He let you take the rap, huh? - Yeah. - What about now? - Look, I'm just trying to get things straight with Shelly. No more, no less. - What about the break-ins, you know, and the safe cracking? Where did you learn that, prison? - Well, yeah. You got the best teachers at your service 24 hours a day. - I can't even begin to imagine how tough it must have been. - I would die before I go back there. - You don't really mean that, do you? (light music) All right, so why risk going in there twice? - He's got security in there that people haven't even dreamed of yet. - I assume you've found a way around this minor little issue? - In theory. - In theory. Revenge. In the end, that's what this whole thing was about. See, Claire had spent two years in prison because she had unknowingly cut some hot diamonds for the west coast's biggest jewel smuggler. And now it was time for him to pay the piper. Okay, so the basic gist of her plan was to double-cross her old boyfriend Shelly, the smuggler, by stealing the jewels, and replacing them with the phony she carved. Now I had to help her sneak into Shelly's office building via the building next door. She said we'd use an old phone cable or something, but to be honest, I really wasn't paying attention. Big mistake. Yeah, Claire, I don't think we're done here yet. Great. Okay. Claire! We've got a problem here! - Oh my God! Jake! You scared the hell out of me. Are you all right? - Yeah, holy fuck! - Good, well, you dropped a bag. - Sorry. (people chattering) - Do you know what to do? - Yeah, believe it or not. - Meet me back in the garage. - So while Claire was double checking the security system, I was on my way to the roof. See, Claire figured the real necklace wouldn't be in Shelly's vault until the weekend. So she devised this elaborate plan to break in during the week to prepare the real switch on Saturday. My job was to set some remote control devices on the elevator motor and other places. That way we'd be able to access the right floors and deactivate the alarms when we came back for the actual switch. Wow, you notice that? I was already thinking of us as we, huh. (people chattering) Come on, come on, come on. Come on. You're late. - [Claire] Well, it's nice to know you missed me. Good night. - Good night, man. (phone line beeping) - No answer. I don't like this. I don't like this at all. - I don't trust her. - Maybe we forget the whole thing, huh? Keep the two million and blow off the switch. If she's working us, we could end up in cement. - Maybe I'll go tail her for a while. See what she's up to. - Yeah. Yeah, keep an eye on her. Don't get made, keep low, right? - Yeah, and you mind your own God damn business you little son of a bitch! You hear me? God damn idiot. - Maybe you ought to think about decaf. - [Jake] What's the problem? - [Claire] It's just like last minute jitters, I don't know. I'm okay. - [Jake] Then let's take it from the top. - Okay, you will have to be here at exactly 7:30. You'll have fine minutes to get in, do your thing and get out. At least 30 seconds, no more than a minute. (soft music) Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. - I don't know, I thought it was one of my better ideas. - Mm-hmm, I just... - I love you. - Oh, my God. Now I know it wasn't a good idea. (dog barking) (phone ringing) - Yeah? You're who? How did you get this number? Okay, okay, just tell me. Are you joking? They must think I'm a complete idiot. Wait a minute, excuse me. How do I know this isn't a setup? Well, if it's true, I owe you. - [Morgan] So what, are you getting dolled up for your lover boy? - What the hell are you doing here? - Yeah, right. What about this kid, huh? What, did you find some time in your busy schedule for some extra curricular activity? - [Claire] Well, it's not what you think. He's the guy from the hotel. He figured out who I was. I'm just keeping him quiet. - I'll keep him quiet. - Oh, put that away, Morgan. Don't be stupid. I've got the situation under control. - So I hear you're sneaking around behind my back, keeping things from me. So I'm supposed to what, just back off and trust you on this one? - Christ. I didn't tell you because I knew you'd react like this. - [Morgan] So why is he still around? - He thinks we're gonna go get the necklace tonight, and I'm going to give it to him so he can run to the cops and make good. - You're bullshitting me. - And he thinks I'm gonna double-cross you. - Are you? - I'm not that stupid. - Nobody's that stupid. - So I'm supposed to believe this kid is dumb enough to think that you're gonna give him the Vanderbilt. - Well, let's just say he's naive. - How am I supposed to believe that? - You don't have to. Meet me when we do the switch. You can be right there with us. Then when we're finished, you can whack him. - Why not now? - [Claire] I still need him. - What has he got that we can't do? - Well, he's memorized the blueprints and schematics. And you don't know the difference between a blueprint and a comic book. - That isn't nice. - Look, I couldn't use you because the guards know you at Shelly's. They'd have made you the first time we cased the place. - What if this kid goes to the cops? - [Claire] Well, I told him I would never do any more time. And he's in love with me. He's not gonna hurt me. - All right. But after tonight, Shank whacks him! Are you good with that? - Couldn't care less. - Hey, I guess I should have grabbed another pizza, huh? - Beat it, kid. We're talking business here. - Do you need help, Claire? - She don't need no help. - Claire? - It's okay, Jake. I'll see you tonight. - [Shank] Yeah, you can get the diamonds back. - Shank, you fucking dickhead. - Wait a minute, they know? - Jesus, just go, Jake. - I don't get it. What are you, just like yanking me along here, or what? - Why don't you take a walk, kid, while your legs are still working? - Yeah, fine. Maybe I'll just go and do what I probably should have done from the start. - Hey, Shorty. A little piece of information for you. I got a lot of friends on the police force in case you have any loved ones that need protecting. - I guess I got no choice. - Not much of one. - I want 20%. - Get fucking real. - Look, it's just basically pulling wires and pressing buttons, okay? But I know where, I know when. If I sit this out, you got a problem. 10%. - Five. - 10. - 5% and it comes out of her end! - I want 10%, I don't care whose end it comes out of. - Kid's got potential. (light suspenseful music) - [Jake] Hey. So now I'm telling Murphy everything: blueprints, timing, everything. I'll tell you, I'd be lying if I didn't say I was scared. The fact is, I couldn't know for sure whether I was playing or being played, and I wouldn't know until the very end, which I was thinking might be mine. - Hey! What's a three-letter word for subseat? - Subseat? Con. - It looks like your boy is going to be a no-show. - He'll show. - If he goes to the cops... - He's not going to the cops. - You're late. - Fire me. - Fire you? Fire you? I'll fucking kill you! - Enough! - This one mine? I'll see you in 45 minutes. - I should have whacked him when I had the chance. - Yeah, well, you'll get the chance soon enough. (Jake grunting) - Hey, Claire. I'll hold onto that. (device beeping) (fan whirring) - [Claire] Jake. I'm on the vault room floor. Let me know when you're in position. - All right, Claire, I'm in. - Good, I'm ready when you are. - Here goes. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! - [Claire] Anytime now. Tell me you're not having a problem up there. A little feedback would be good here, Jake. - Yeah, yeah. - [Claire] Jake, what's happening? Okay, I'm in. Meet me on the vault floor. - Got it. (light suspenseful music) (device beeping) Okay, so far so good. - So far. - Ready? - Oh, I thought it would all be out in the open. - Can you open it? - We shall see. Pretty swift. - Holy shit. So how much you figure all this stuff is worth? - There's a rose colored diamond. About 800,000 retail. - [Morgan] You always did have a good eye. - I thought you were gonna stay in the car. - Yeah. Well, I thought I'd check out the action. You make the switch? - Yeah. - Good. - Wait a second, where's my half? - You and me all the way, babe, remember? Getting any lately, shorty? Shank, take care of her. - Oh, you are so predictable, Morgan. - I hope you got Shelly figured out as good as you got me. - [Ned] Someone certainly does. - Ned? - If I'm not mistaken, that belongs to me. - I think you got the wrong idea, Ned. - Don't play me, it's stupid. - All right, so all this time, she's been working with you? - No, I just got a call this afternoon. Hello, Claire. It's been a long time. Thank you. You still take my breath away. This is 40 or 50,000. I was told you were getting half! - There's supposed to be 500,000 here. - I gave him two million. And he told you it was one. (laughs) - You son of a bitch! - [Officer] LAPD, weapons down! Put the gun down! Put it down, asshole! And put your hands behind your head! - Do what he says, Tee. - You all have the right to remain silent. - Excuse me. This is private property. You got a warrant? - We heard that there was a robbery in progress. - Not from me you didn't, and I own this place. Now get out of here before I press charges! - Oh, you're Ned Shelly. - That's right. - And you have the right to remain silent. - I will not remain silent, and I want a damn lawyer! - Stay away from the jewels. I'm taking those. - That's my property! - Did you do this, Jake? - I'm sorry. - Yeah, well, I told you I was never going back. - Claire, Claire, don't do this! Claire! - Stop now! She's got a gun! (gun fires) Get an ambulance up here right away! And get those guys out of here! - [Officer] Paramedics, 10th floor, ASAP. - Oh, Claire, why did you do that? Why did you do that? You didn't have to do that. - You had to be a good guy. - [Jake] You gave me no choice. - Do you still love me? - Yes, yes. - I'm sorry. (faint radio chattering) - [Officer] Watch your head, sir. Move that car over there. Lean inside. (siren wailing) - Did they buy it? - Are you kidding? Of course they bought it! Even I bought it! You guys were great! I mean, both of you, great! I'm not kidding you. - Talk about overacting. - Hey, hey, hey! Under the circumstances, you know, I think I did a pretty good job, all right? So don't even start. - All right, listen. Now we've got some important matters to discuss. Jason? I've got some papers and a ticket for you. - Tickets, passport, no ID. - Hey, that's the guy from the-- - Yeah, yeah, he's one of us. - I've been covering you from the get-go. - You're gonna give me a nice funeral? - I got nothing in the budget for nice. - Well, what about the money? - A deal is a deal, Jason? Just as we promised. 40,000. - Well, it hardly makes up for two years in prison. I just hope they get some serious time. - That isn't up to me. But we've been trying to nail them for 10 years, and this will be the best case that we've ever had. I'm gonna move up front and leave you two alone for a few minutes. - So, I don't know, I guess this is it. - Yeah, I guess so. - Hey, you won't forget about me, will you? - Not a chance. - Yeah. (dramatic music) (upbeat music) You have to understand, I couldn't let her go. I mean, she would have gone into hiding. I never would have seen her again. I love you. I'll miss you a lot. I think about you often, and I've included a picture of us so you know we're okay. Hey, but listen. You've got to throw it away along with this letter. I'm not kidding about that. And if anybody asks, just tell them I've joined the CIA. I like the way that sounds. You've probably noticed I've sent along the keys to my car. I left it parked at Fourth and Grand. I trust you'll take good care of her for me. Oh, and one last thing, you may want to check the glove box as soon as possible. Love and peace, your big brother, Jake.
