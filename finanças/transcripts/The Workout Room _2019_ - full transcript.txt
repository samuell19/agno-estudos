Yeah, I understand what you're saying but I mean look at my point here, you know what I mean? Well, Ms. Xena, you obviously don't. I sent a comedian here the other day and she said you didn't even acknowledge her. What, who? See, that's my point. Women go out in groups tend to support other women. Sponsors like that. Now, you being such a powerful woman, now see you should know that. Okay, now wait a minute now. Look, now first I understand that you're here to help us out, but you need to put that thing back in your pants, and stop trying to screw me. Now I let the Ms. Xena thing slide too. But no, don't do that. And please don't tell me what I should know because I'm a woman. You men have no idea, not even a piece of an idea of how hard it is to be a woman in an all man's business. Hell, to work in any business for that matter. Yeah, so please don't tell me that. Well okay, I'm listening. What do you suggest? Well, Mr. Clive, we have made several changes at this establishment, several, and many more are in the works. Okay, I'm not denying the changes you've made since you've taken over the spot. I mean it's like night and day. But in order to give you sponsorship funds I need to see certain changes tonight. Come on, you acting like you don't know me. That has nothing to do with it, look, I have bosses too and we have to have these proposals done by Monday. I mean we have a desk stacked full of proposals that need to be done. Now Xena, come on now, really? All right, okay, tonight. All right, okay, so don't let me down. So, I'm gonna be inviting a few friends myself and the boss said he may come with. If that's it I'll see you tonight. Come give me a hug, come here. Okay now, do you usually hug men after meetings? No. Okay. But question, are you still with that boyfriend of yours? Now see if I was a man, again, would you ask that question and after a business meeting? I'm just saying. Actually I would, because I kinda thought he was cute. What the hell? Did you get your shoes yet? Yep, after I get my dress I'll be all good. Well, except for my mani, pedi, hair, make-up, wax. Ugh, like I really hate men. Ha, bruh. One second, hello, oh, hey boss.

Mine too. Let's do this.
