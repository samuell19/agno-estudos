There's no time for me to look back or look ahead. There's so much going on and I've enjoyed every minute of it and I still want to keep playing and after this game I'll probably take a week or two off and then get back to work, so I love to do that after winning the game, that will make the off season obviously a lot more enjoyable. On the football field, he was as dedicated as any player, as a teammate, he's as good a teammate as you could have. Brady the throw, right away. He hits Kirby. He took it upon himself to work really hard. And now you see the final result. He was so annoyed that he got taken so late in the draft. He wants to prove the one hundred ninety eight guys ahead him, that no one's as good as him. They were expecting that he would be a solid quarterback and maybe even a very good quarterback someday, but he exceeded all their expectations. But he throws an incomplete pass. He goes nuts. Somebody runs the wrong route. He goes nuts. The guy is down by twenty five points in the second half, and you still think: It's Tom Brady? It's not completely over. That's why you play to the end. It's a 60 minute game and we're disappointed in the way we played and knew that we could go out and do a lot better in the second half. Tom's next game isn't against the opponent. It's against the critics. He meets Bob Kraft, the owner of the. New England Patriots, and he says: "I'm the best decision this franchise has ever made." Just think about that! See, he's the most hated Quarterback, why? Because he's the best quarterback. There is a similarity between throwing a football and throwing a baseball, a lot of the the arm action is the same. The the body position, the use of your legs is the same. There's just a little bit difference in the delivery. The actual ball coming out of the hand is a little different because the baseball, you're on the top, football you're on the side. But Tommy's throwing ability he threw both balls great. He's one of the best catchers I've had at throwing the ball. He was a big, strong guy, he's a left handed hitter, he had power, he hit home runs. I think he would have had power in professional baseball. He was a good hitter for average. Probably his only the only downfall is, he didn't run really well. And I think he's actually gotten better at that. My connection with Tom Brady as he played JB football here for me, and some other sports and his family, they're not too far from the high school here. And the parents are very involved in his life. They keep away from the sport, but they're very influential to him at the same time, they make sure Tommy does the right things, worked hard and is very respectful of his coaches. So that in itself told me something about the family is like: Oh, I don't have to worry about parents. His dad was an athlete. His sisters were college softball pitcher, one of the best in the nation. His other sisters, I believe, were soccer players, all at top ranked colleges. And Tommy, being the baby of the family, was around a football, dad with baseball, always something in his hands at all time. He would always love to talk about his sisters. He's the youngest of four, but he was a pretty simple guy. He was in the sports and his family. There wasn't a lot of other stuff. Would he have succeeded in Major. League Baseball? No question. He played against Erik Backich, the Michigan baseball coach. They were high school rivals, their teams, and they played against each other in high school. Tommy was a legit MLB prospect, without question. I think Tom Brady would have potentially been a major league catcher. I think he had that kind of ability. But to forecast that Tom Brady would have become as great in baseball as he did in football, you can't do because he would have had to become the greatest player of all time in baseball. And that, as good as he was, that would have been a long shot. So when you see something special come through, you're sort of just pointing it and go, huh? I think we can do something with that. And here was a kid, because as Tom is, he's slow on feet, but he works at it, and he has a good mind for the game, and he really worked on his throwing mechanics and he threw a very nice ball, he played catcher in baseball and he was, what I thought he would actually play, but he kept pursuing football. And I guess that one paid off a little bit for him. And I'm not a really reactive athlete. You know, people have seen me play for a long time. I like to really anticipate things when I'm out there. I'm not sure if we've ever done a high school football game in our five years where you could say that. It's very impressive this far, both teams have played an excellent ball game and it's not done yet. I was really impressed when I saw him in person, face to face, because I was shocked how big he is. And I always thought that he is, you know, my size, maybe one meter, eighty eight, something like that. Not that muscular. But if you see him in person on the field with cleats on, shoulder pads and helmet, he is not a small guy. I think a lot of people don't realize that he is I think he is six four, one meter ninety three. He is bigger than a lot of people think. I was the first guy to believe in Tom. So I said: Hey, I got someone who can play quarterback, hey, he's intelligent, I can do some special things." And I worked hard with Tommy whenever he wanted that extra time, I gave him the extra time. I think that was it, just the belief in him, positive coaching and then also just the extra work when he wanted it. Brady to Kirby, at the twenty five down to the twenty one. He said he really wanted to be a quarterback and when that kid puts his mind to something, he's pretty driven. So he always goes the extra mile, doing the extra work to try to perfect whatever he's doing. Even at that age. You've got to put the work in. You've got to listen. You've got to be be humble enough to learn. You know, he can't think, you know, everything you got, you know, it's football is too difficult of a game and there's too much, it's not an individual sport. It's a coordination between a lot of different people. Brady the throw right away. He hits Kirby out to the thirty six yard line. It's going to be just short of a first down. You know in high school we were really good friends on the football field. Tom and I actually created our own plays back then. We created a signal to where he would look out and check out the defense. He would pull his face mask and for me to acknowledge it back, I would pull up my left sock. And then we knew that he was going to throw me the pass on that play. You can definitely see him improvise from time to time. And, you know, his famous quarterback sneak where he goes over the top. That's kind of a play that he'll just call and not even let the other line men know. So, yeah, I see that all the time. And it's really awesome to hear his cadence or to hear him on TV when he's saying: "Red thirty five, red thirty five!" And it's funny, you know, I used to be on this field hearing that same voice all the time, so it's very, very familiar. Brady looking over the defense, six foot four. How's the slant if he wants it, and he takes it. Kirby, out the forty five pick up above eleven. In a first down. We couldn't have anybody film for us. Some did, but not the lower level. And they would get the films and they'd be watching films of the games. I'd be watching films of other teams, but they're watching themselves and critiquing themselves. And then I'm sure they bring it home. And, you know, Tom. Senior is doing it. Back in the early 90s, there wasn't a lot of football film study, especially in high school. And Tom brought it on himself with myself and the other receivers. Every Sunday, we'd play on either Friday or Saturday. Every Sunday, we'd go to his house for lunch, meeting him and the other receivers. His mom would make us sandwiches. We'd sit down and analyze the film. Brady the throw, Kirby with a great catch over the shoulder and the thirty five. "Sprinkler gate" was our sophomore year championship when Tommy, it was his first year as a starter and my first year as a starting receiver, we went down to play Bellarmine for the league championship. We were driving for the winning touchdown. Go ahead, touchdown. And it was six p.m. because our game had gone so long and at six p.m. back then the sprinklers came on. So we had to wait about fifteen minutes for them to clear everything out. Sprinklers go down, you start driving down the field, sprinklers come on again. Have to stop it again. Get the ball back. The ball's wet. Tommy drops back, throws a swing to our running back. He fumbles, they pick it up and take it to the house. And I swear to this day, Bellarmine turn the sprinklers on on purpose. I think the fact that Tom Brady was a really good recruit when he came to Michigan. People expected him to be a good player. They never expected him to be a great player, and that's what he became. In my book about Greg. Harden, the counselor at Michigan who worked with our athletes, Tom Brady, walked into his office one day and said: "One of the guys on the team said, you can help me. You know, I want to be the starter at Michigan. I'm not there. I'm way down on the depth chart."‚Äù And Greg Harden got Tom Brady to believe in himself in their conversations to the point where he was able to perform at a high level. Tom Brady kind of becoming an afterthought. You know, Tom Brady and Drew Brees played against each other in college in 1999, Everybody talks about their pro careers. But in 1999, Tom Brady and Michigan was number four in the country and. Purdue is number 11 in the country in 1999, And Tom Brady and Michigan won 38 to 12. And that was the first time that those guys played. You know, that's phenomenal that two guys both lasted for over 20 years in the game of football and became, you know, perhaps the two most accomplished statistical of quarterbacks of all time. Drew Henson was LeBron James and Tom Brady level high school player. He was the best high school player in baseball and football in the. United States. He won them both in. USA Today. And Drew is from Brighton, Michigan, which is about 20 minutes outside of Ann Arbor. He was the biggest recruit probably in the history of Michigan football. He came here to Michigan. Great talent, great friend of mine, great guy. And he was chiefs... he was supposed to be the Michigan quarterback in ninety eight and ninety nine. And there was one problem. There was one person in Ann Arbor who didn't think the grandson should be the quarterback. Thomas Edward Brady didn't think. Drew Henson should be the quarterback. The Syracuse game in nineteen ninety eight was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at Michigan, I was with the team for almost six years. We had lost the first game, Notre. Dame. We lost the Syracuse game, full team had played and the fans started on Tom and they were booing him, they wanted Drew Henson to play. It was very bad. I was afraid I was going to leave. I thought it was going to transfer. It was very bad. I thought Drew. Henson was going to be the quarterback from forward. And I just let Tom know I believed in him and we're going to rally and he's got to keep fighting and I believe in him. We played basketball together and we're playing this frat guys and they're making fun of Tom because of Drew Henson and the game's over, we're about to win. We're up by like 20 points. And Tommy looks at me and says: "Beav, how many fouls do I have?" And Tommy's got two fouls, you're allowed four and he says: "Beav, the next time you bring the ball up the court, sprint off the court and don't look back. Whatever you do." I get the ball, speed up the court. All of a sudden, I here a "splatt". Tommy elbowed the guy that was making fun of him the whole game and knocked the kid off. That's like Tom Brady today moment in nineteen ninety nine, hilarious. Just... and I was offered to beat this kid up the whole game. Tom was like: Beav don't worry about it, just classic, classic Tom Brady. Cleans up his own mess, as he'd like to say. By the time he left Michigan, he had a great Orange Bowl game where he threw for three hundred and sixty nine yards and five touchdowns, that was his last college game, beat Alabama in overtime. And that's the game that put him on the map. Simply by that, he's a role model to a lot of people, simply by being an NFL player and becoming one, making that transition from college to the NFL opens a lot of doors and dreams for the youth. But then being as successful as he was, his work ethic, his continues drive to win. There's a lot of things that we can learn from that man. And I remember when we drafted him back in 2000, I mean, he had a chip on his shoulder because he was so annoyed that he got taken so late in the draft, he got taken in the sixth round. One hundred and ninety ninth player. I think Tom Brady definitely had to have a chip on his shoulder as a sixth round draft pick. "And that's all they think of me?" You know, knowing that he closed out his college career so strongly, he probably didn't expect to be a first round draft pick, but he might have been thinking: "I'll go the second, the third round" and then tick, tick, tick sixth round. You go and it's like: "I've got some people to prove some things to." I think if Tom wasn't dropped in the sixth round or dropped in one ninety nine, it would have changed a lot of things. Because what makes Tom so successful, he wants to prove the one hundred ninety eight guys ahead him that no one's as good as him. When Tom Brady got drafted by the. Patriots, I was the pro football editor of the Tampa Tribune and I'm paying attention to who the Bucs are drafting. But more than anything, I'm actually: Where are my boys going? The guys I covered in Michigan. And when I saw that he went there, I knew it was a winning program and that that would be good. But I also knew that Drew Bledsoe was the quarterback and that wasn't that good. However, as a sixth round draft pick, you figure Tom had needed a couple of years to kind of get his feet on the ground and be ready to be a starter. So it seemed like a good situation for Tom to go to New England. He was so excited. I told him I was excited for him. He's going to my team, the Patriots, and he was getting ready to hang up on me. And he said something pretty damn funny. He knows I love Drew Bledsoe and of course, Tom Brady being Tom Brady, says: "Beav, I'm going to take Bledsoe's job." The thing that amazes me about Tom Brady is, he's a sixth round draft pick, those guys are marginal. They might not even make the team. And he meets Bob Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, and he says: "I'm the best decision this franchise has ever made." Just think about that. You know, I mean, here's a guy who was a pretty good quarterback at Michigan who goes sixth round of the draft, and that's what he tells the owner and he made good on it. I was happy when Tom Brady made the Patriots, I felt sorry for Drew Bledsoe, but when that went down, we had a few of the other coaches around and we were so excited. "He's in the game, look, I don't get... he's made it to the pros!" And then it just escalated from there. They can't really see your heart, you know, and there are so many free agents, so many late round draft picks who had amazing Hall of Fame careers, because one thing you can never measure or see is the heart, really. And I think he's one of those players, with this... the eternal nonstop drive for you to become the best. To be better than you were yesterday. Brady being drafted in the sixth round, he can name the quarterbacks that went before him, every one of them, seen him do it plenty of times. For them, Brady is like: You're good, but you're not good enough to be the mayor, you know. So I think for him getting drafted in the sixth round, every quarterback going before him, that just gave him the motivation to go out and try to prove that he can play this game at a high level. I think, you know, when I think of. Bill Belichick, I think of toughness. And he demands that of his players, toughness and loyalty and playing the game the right way and being a 12 month a year player. I think that, you know, he's an old school football coach, not just because he's an older guy. You know, I think he's made good contributions to the game. Anybody who wins the number of Super. Bowls he's won has to be a solid coach. I don't know if they had a huge impact on Tom Brady. I think he had some impact on Tom Brady, but not a huge. I think Bill did a really good job back in and 2001, on August 5th of that year, the guy who was just coaching quarterbacks, close friend of mine by the name of Dick Rebind died. OK, he died in training camp on a day off. We had a day off in training camp and he was running on a treadmill and passed out on a treadmill. And I talked to him that day and he was fine. And he was going to get a stress test the next day and had the stress test and he dropped and he was dead. And Belichick and I sat down and we decided that we would handle the quarterback position just ourselves. So I think even back then, starting all the way back in 2001, I mean, I think he's had a very, very big, positive influence on Tom. I'm from New Jersey, and as you know, growing up in New Jersey, even though Tommy was kind of cocky, he knew not to get carried away. I mean, we had one instance in practice where Tommy threw the ball to the wrong guy. It was a completion, OK, they caught it. But, you know, certain plays are designed to go to a certain spot and he didn't throw it to the right spot. So I looked at him and I said: "Why didn't you throw it there?" And he goes: "Well..." and I said: Where are you supposed to go versus that coverage? Where's the ball supposed to go? "And he goes: " Well, it's really supposed to go to the tight end. And I go: "Was the tight end open? "He goes: "I don't know, I didn't look at him." I said: "Why didn't you look at him?" And he goes: "Well, because, you know, I threw it back there." So I took off my whistle around my neck and I threw it at him. And he goes: "What?" I said: "You might as well call the plays. I mean, if you're not going to listen to me, I mean, you know, I'm the one supposed to be calling the plays. Now you're calling the plays?" So for the next few years, we no longer had that argument. He actually was our fourth string quarterback that whole year, you know, most teams in the league keep three. We kept him because we saw something in him, he wasn't anywhere near ready. He used that year to get himself, his body ready and his mind ready. And, you know, by the end of that first year, the first year, he only threw three passes and one completion. It was one for three, his first year in the league. Brady had already been in. New England, a year before I got there, they drafted him in 2000. I got there two thousand one, but. Drew Bledsoe was the mayor. Drew Bledsoe had just signed a contract to become... just became the first hundred million dollar quarterback. And so it's Drew's team. And nobody could have fathomed, Drew Bledsoe was the highest paid player in the NFL at that time and really top notch quarterback. And the fact that Tom Brady took the job when he got a chance and never looked back at that. I think that's most phenomenal thing and you think, what if Drew Bledsoe had never gotten hurt? What if Tom Brady had backed him up for three years? What if he, you know, sort of atrophied or something like, you know, in his career and never really got the chance to be Tom Brady? But a lot of you know, when a guy becomes great, they need to really want it, which Tom obviously wants it as badly as anybody still does. Until he get a full grasp of the offense and of the playbook, because he's just getting thrown in. He had to lean on me, had to lean on Antowain the running back, until we slowly brought Tommy along in the playbook and you can see each game he's getting better and better in the passing game. He's getting more familiar. He's getting you know, he's getting more comfortable in the plays that's being called and you can see... and you can see he's a very fiery guy. Tommy needed to be on the Patriots and learn from Bill Belichick and Charlie Weis and Dick Reebein and Drew Bledsoe. You asked me if Tom would be what he was if Drew Bledsoe didn't get hurt? I don't believe so. But there's a second part to that, that is very important that nobody talks about. Tom won the second, the backup quarterback job in the off season in 2001 from Damon Heward and if he didn't work hard and win that job, you would not know who he is. You would not be interviewing me right now. As they say, one man's trash is another man's treasure. He was in a fight for the backup quarterback with a guy that we had just picked up from the. Dolphins by the name of Damon Heward. And at the end of training camp, Bill and I sat down and we picked Tommy by this much. Wasn't like he beat them out by a lot. And when Bledsoe got hurt early in the year and Tommy went in, we took baby steps. We didn't get too wild. We didn't throw the ball all over the place. We kind of took steps and let the offense grow as the year went on and grow it did, because by the end of that year, you know, we were in a two minute drive to win the Super Bowl with Tommy at the helm. And next thing you know, the confetti is all over the place. And we had just won the Super Bowl. That was Super Bowl 36. Super Bowl Sunday! If you're playing in it, you're a wrack. First of all, the night before seemed like the longest night. You have plays going over in your head. You don't want to make a mistake, you can dream about making a big play, but you also dream about. You really don't get no productive rest. You wake up that morning about 6:00 a.m., you go to breakfast. You know, the Super Bowl is played later on that evening. So you got another long day anticipating, waiting for it to happen. And you just kill yourself, beat yourself up. You just you can't rest. You just want to get to the stadium and get that first lick so you can get the butterflies out your stomach. So then you know that you're ready to play ball. His biggest moment ever was Super. Bowl 36, where he hit Troy Brown, we had four wide receivers on the field. It was a tie ball game. Bellichick was like defense, you have to be physical on their receivers, because their little, fast receivers get in and out. And he was like, on the offensive side Antowain, we got to run you, we got to play off ball control game, you got to slow the game down for them. Keep the offense. If our offense is on the field, that means, the offense is on the bench and that's what we want to do, slow them down. They had all the momentum, so it was a little over a minute to go. We had no timeouts and we're playing with this inexperienced quarterback, a second year guy and his first year playing. The last thing Bill said to him: "No matter what, you can't take a sack. You can't take a sack." And I said to him: "Don't forget your checkdown", which is a very conservative route. We just dump the ball off to the back. And Bledsoe was standing there, he goes "The hell was that." He goes: "Just swing it", you know, and "just go ahead and swing it. Don't worry about that." The Rams had just tied the game up. It is 1717. They went that they had all the momentum and they kicked the ball off. We get stuck deep in our own end of the field. So first play, Brady comes out, almost gets sacked. He does a little dump off pass to J.R. Redmond. J.R. gets up, he gets some yards. So, second play, Then he hits J.R. again. So J.R. on the sideline, he does a little move, he gets out of bounds and now everybody on our sideline is feeling good about ourselves. Here we go. Because we don't want to go to overtime. And you know how it is in momentum, once the team's got a momentum, you know, it's tough to stop that rolling once they have it. So, I mean, it was probably one of the greatest drives that there's been in the Super Bowl history because all the momentum was on the other side, with a relatively inexperienced quarterback. And I honestly feel if the game had to went to overtime, I think the. Rams would have been... it would have been a different outcome. Okay, we're just on our side of midfield, okay? We had three receivers on the right, one on the left, all three receivers on the right. We're all running in cuts. We're all running ends at different levels. He hit the first of the three, the inside guy of the three. His name is Troy Brown, one of my favorite players who then ran out of bounds up the left sideline and got us into field goal range. When he kicked the ball, I'm behind so I see it, if anybody ever see that dude that's running on the field when we won the first Super Bowl, high kicking and doing this? That's me, because I'm behind, I see it, I'm on the field. I'm standing like: Oh shit, we won, it's just, I lose my mind man, it's just... it's unbelievable. In that moment, the feeling it's just, total emotions just take over. And that was the greatest feeling I have ever had. I think the locker room after his first Super Bowl win, I think that would have been pretty terrific. I would love to be there. Oh, the after party after winning the Super Bowl. So, Mr. Kraft, he has set up for us. He has it set up, we go back to the hotel, we go to the party room it's champagne, it's beer, it's caviar. And all the players and their family, everybody in one big room and everybody just had had a blast into the morning hours. Everybody congratulated, taking pictures within the Lombardi trophy, just feeling good about ourselves, like we are the champions of the world. After we won Super Bowl thirty six, all of a sudden he had all these girls chasing him, all these movie stars, and because they heard how close he and I were at the time, I would have agents for these movie stars reaching out to me to see if they get to Tommy. So I set him down and said: Look, you didn't get a good looking overnight. Like all of a sudden, no one wanted you. Now all of a sudden you won a Super. Bowl and they think you're good looking. So I was making fun of him. But in reality letting him know, be careful, be careful, because you've gone from a person that no one knew to a superstar. You know, you got to be careful. So that was my advice to him off the field. Bill Belichick in the way he handled his business, the Patriots way and the way Tom Brady functioned not only as an athlete but as a human being. Well, the Patriot Way is, you know, there's one phrase: Do your job. Check your ego at the door. That's a simple way of telling you what the Patriots are about. Check your ego at the door. I was one of the team mates that they kind of started the Patriots way, you know, we start winning, but it's just hard nose grinding, knowing your assignment as the phrase they do know, that again also is: Do your job, meaning just, do your job. Don't worry about trying to do nobody else's job. You've got 11 guys doing their job. That's the Patriots way. And it's just playing fun. Some fundamental football mistake free. You've got a lot of people, you know, a lot of people and a professional sports team that have big egos, you have owners who have big egos, you have coaches who have big egos. You've got players who have big egos. Okay, there's a lot of egos. And Bill, better than anyone I've ever seen, has been able to get everyone to check their egos at the door and make it all about the team. He cuts players that are really good players. He trades players that are really good players because if it's in the best interests of the team then he's going ahead and doing it. That's because of the locker room. See problem guys we used to say they like to find that little group in the locker room where they can bitch and moan about, you know, everything. But when you walk into that locker room, there was nowhere for them to go. So what would they do? They'd convert because that's what you do. And I think that Bill gets credit for that, for building that mentality, that good football team. The locker room really controls, you know, what happens with the players. Tom is always focused on his job, whatever his task is, whether it's being a dad, whether it's being a quarterback, whether it's being in training for football and in life, he's always laser focused and he's got an incredible ability to focus on whatever he's doing at the time at excel at it. Sometimes you got to fight your own way through. And that's exactly what Tom proves, you know, all the way through Michigan and then, you know, becoming what he is today. Tommy yeah, there was always better athletes than Tommy. Harder workers? No. More heart? No. More competition? No, those are the little extra boxes that you check off when you're playing. He has this insatiable desire to make himself better and make his team better. He never rests on the accomplishment that he, that he has right now or in the past. He's always looking to get the next ring, the next win, the next championship. Well, it's, there's nothing about last year and that's in the past. And we have a new experience this year, so. Our future, you know, we've got to be able to create our own future. And that's really about attitude, effort, preparation. Tom is always motivated by: "Tom you're too old. Tom you're too slow." Tom's next game isn't against the opponent. It's against the critics and the people who don't believe in Tom. And Tom's whole focus is, I'm going to shut these people up. You can find somebody like that and you still let them know: You can't do it. That just adds even more gas into the fire where it's just like: Oh, you think I can't do it? Now imma go twice as hard. So it's like, there's certain people you should not, you know, irritate them. Is Brady a practice monster? Let me, let me, let me take my hat off for this one. It will be sometimes after practice. Now, Brady started off as the third string quarterback and moved his way up to the second string and when Drew Bledsoe got hurt he became the first string quarterback. And he will have us after practice, running routes, catching balls. "Come on Antowain, let's go." Out the backs running the routes and we'll be like: "Goddamn, we just practiced, full pads for two hours getting hit on. All you did with all the quarterbacks, you can't hit the quarterback, but we beat up. But he still want to go out there and practice. But that was him learning the game and being the professional player that he is today. Just that drive to be the best that he could be. Tell me he truly plays the way that he practices. In practice he would talk at. Lawyer Milloy and Ty Law, because when he was younger, coming in with Bledsoe, they would tease him, they would pick him up: "Throw it right here Brady", and that would fire him up. That would make him so mad. And so when he would make a good play against one of those, against Ty, Lawyer or somebody in practice or anybody with a good throw, he'd be like: "Yeah, yeah. That's it. I told you, I got this" and know, that's the type of fiery guy that Tommy is and it started truly. So what you see, he was doing that in practice, so that is what he does in the game. Ain't no pretending right there, that is Tom Brady. I don't know what motivates Tom now, but I'll give you an example. He was playing in one of those little golf tournaments. Tom was in the parking lot before doing sprints. And I know this because my son in law was there watching it. And he's going, he left. He did sprints. He played 18 holes and then he went back to the parking lot and did more sprints because he had practice coming up in a few days. That in itself saying he's always doing something. And when he was here, it was like: "Well, I need to throw extra, coach stay extra. Hey, coach, I need to work on my footwork... He was very tough on himself. And we may have won a game, but he didn't get a hit. And it was hard for him to accept that and just to get him to relax and understand how important he was to us. Got to come show up to work every day, try to go out and get our job done. I'd say, you know, today wasn't our best day. So I guess I'm a little frustrated from that. We as running backs been practicing all day, you got pads on you can beat up, you can beat to the ground. And he wants to play catch at the practice and you're like: "Damn Tommy, man we're tired" and then he's coming: "Oh, we're trying to be great" and then one of them days you be like: "Man, I don't want to hear that today man. I'm finna go in. I'm tired." But then he goes: "Oh, you...". OK, man. Now we got to play catch with him because now he got mad and we got mad because we're tired and want to go in, but he wants to play catch. You know, it's one thing if, you know, we miss a pass, we catch a pass. I'm just unconcerned that's, you know, doing the things that we talked about doing and executing them the right way. And then, you know, the throwing and catching and blocking and tackling. I mean, that's for the game. You know, you catch every ball out here, you go in the game, you drop it. It doesn't matter. It's you know, you've got to work on the fundamentals out here, work on your communication. You know, we could definitely do a much better job of that. And Tom, by the way, can be an asshole when he's playing. Tom gets on guys when they screw up, he yells at them. But they love Tommy. His teammates love him. And it's the fifth string guys and the stars that love him. There's this level of accountability when you have veteran guys like Tom around where you're not only going to get it from the coaches, but the veteran players as well, just with the expectations that they have for you. But he throws an incomplete pass, he goes nuts. Somebody runs the wrong route. He goes nuts. So when he throws an incomplete pass, he'll go nuts on himself now. It's just not nuts on other people. But I mean, if somebody runs wrong route, he will say: What are you doing? That's an "In". "In". He's like another coach on the field. But in practice, he's as competitive in practice as he is in the games. I don't know if you've ever watched the movie Groundhog Day with Bill Murray, where he wakes up every day and it's the same day, that's what practice is. Every day is the same. So let's just say it's a Wednesday, just a Wednesday, so Wednesday morning, I'm going to him, because I always used to have to be prepared before he got there. So I'd be ready to go at five a.m.. My assistant coach that would help with the quarterbacks would meet with me at six a.m., at six thirty every day Tommy would come in, alone and go over all the new installation that was going in that we had prepared the night before. Seven o'clock the rest of the quarterbacks would come in and we do it all over again. We go over that installation all over again. Then eight o'clock he would meet with all the skill people, all the wide receivers, the tight ends and the running backs and go over the passes for the day, okay, before we even install them. So the players had their heads up, then we'd have a team meeting and then we get going, go with meetings, get going with practice. Now your practice is over, okay? Now you meet with the players, you go over the videotape from that day and then they would be done with the coaches, because now the coaches have to start preparing for the next day. He doesn't like missing practice, Tommy does not like missing practice. And if he's missing practice it's just to save his body. It has nothing to do. He likes practice, you know, because he always felt and we always felt as an organization that, you know, when you're going to practice, you're going to play like you practice. And I think one of the reasons why our team won so much is, because we practiced so hard. People say Michael Jordan, they say Kobe was arrogant and cocky, but you earn it with your play, you earned that respect. If you're not that good people wouldn't say that you were cocky or say that you're overrated, you earn it through your play. See he's the most hated quarterback. Why? Because he's the best quarterback. To me, he'd done more with less talent around him than any other quarterback, force at the wide receiver position. If you are being disliked by people, then you have to earn that. And he earned all the hate that he gets, he earned it because he is the most successful guy. It's tough to be as successful as Tom Brady and being liked by everybody. That's just not the case. I understand if you look at him and you see some of the stuff that goes on on the sideline where he gets into it with Josh McDaniels, offense coordinator, you know, he's very competitive and he will let you know if he's not happy with anything. And that rubs people the wrong way. But ultimately, that's exactly how you want a professional, successful athlete to be. But, you know, not everybody understands that. And I understand that fans look at him and say: "Well, he's too cocky. He's too arrogant." Well, yeah, that might be the case. But you have to have that certain edge to be the best for. Let's kill Brady. Let's kill. Every time you succeed, people will hate and this man had a lot of success. So there is a correlation between hate and success. No matter how good you are, no matter how great, no matter how much you perform, there's always somebody who doesn't like what you do. There's always somebody who thinks somebody else could do better than you. Tom's focus is on winning the next game. Doesn't care what people's opinion are, does not care. Unless they're in a decision making position involving Tom. He doesn't care about stuff like that. And that's why I really like him, because he just, it comes in here and gets out there. Gronkowski has managed to be sort of the frat boy, the party animal without getting in trouble, which is, that's pretty impressive because almost anybody who who flies as loose as Rob Gronkowski does they tend to get into trouble. And I can't think of of any troubles that Rob's gotten into with the law. He seems to know where the line is, that's difficult if you're out there, you know, partying a lot. Congratulations, Gronk! Thank you, I appreciate that. Oh, my gosh, this is insane. I think it's probably the brand that comes with the jersey and the brand that comes with the individual, I think the Tom Brady brand is a different brand than the Gronk brand. Big Gronk, the party Gronk, I can see why people would rather associate with a partying six seven, two hundred and forty five dude than a forty four year old quarterback who has been playing that game for, 30, 50, 60 years. Tom Brady is not famous for being a fancy, good looking guy. Uh, well, he is good looking. He's got a gorgeous wife, too, but he is not the swagger type of fashion guy like Cam Newton is. Or plus, he is a different generation. He is more the old school throwback quarterback from the early 2000s. He is not a Pat Mahomes or Lamar Jackson with this Oakleys on. That's not Tom Brady. The good thing is he doesn't need to sell one single T-shirt anyway because I think he's pretty wealthy. I think he padded his game after Joe Montana, I think him winning seven. Super Bowls, being arguably the best quarterback to ever play the National Football. League. But you will have some people that say Joe Montana. And I truly think he wants to be up there by himself, I think Brady wants to be up there on the mountain by himself. You have to have that certain edge to yourself. But obviously some people don't like that. But ultimately, he wins. And that's what matters in pro football. This year down 25 points. I mean, it's hard to imagine us winning, but it took a lot of great plays. And that's why you play to the end. It's 60 minute game. And, you know, at halftime, I'd say we weren't down at all. I mean, we were disappointed in the way we played and knew that we could go out and do a lot better in the second half. He's down twenty eight to three and he wins thirty four to twenty eight. I remember watching that game when he was down and the announcers even were starting to write him off and I thought, I don't know if he's going to win this game, but he's going to make a game of it. That's how good he is. You're confident the guy is down by twenty five points in the second half and you still think it's Tom Brady. He's the only guy maybe in the history of football that when he's down by that much in the second half of the game, you think: "It's not over. It's not completely over." He's like a coach's nightmare. Every coach is paranoid. And until, like, you know, they're up by 17 points with two minutes to go. And football coaches still feel there's some way they can lose the game. But Tom Brady is, I think, part of the reason for that nightmare, that they think maybe this guy is going to be Tom Brady, maybe somebody is going to do what Tom Brady does and find a way to beat us. And that's what Tom does. You know, the losses in this game are tough. I mean, you're going to live with those for the rest of your life and those will be games if you lose there's regrets about every play in that game. So, you know, when you win, you don't think about any of those things. There's no regrets. So you just got to try to, you know, put everything aside. so you can have your best performance on Sunday night. That's what we're going to remember most about this week, is the game and you know, that's really what I want to get to be focused on as well. A lot of stuff that goes on in the media really has nothing to do with what's going on inside that locker room. Inside the locker room we are worried about the next game, the next opponent, what we can improve on from the week before that. The reality if the NFL is that every year the deck of cards gets shuffled and somebody that you were just playing with is on a different team. You don't know if you're going to be here. You don't know if there's going to be a tomorrow for you. It doesn't matter who you are. It doesn't matter if you're the best player at your position. I just think it was time, you know, and you see this a lot in professional sports, sometimes that's what happens. And, you know, you saw the same thing with Joe Montana at the end of the career. They want to bring in younger, fresher people. And Tom wasn't done playing, so made the trip on over to Tampa. As far as I know, they split on good terms, you know, the press sometimes can add a few things here from what I heard, but it was definitely a good split and everyone left peacefully and now everyone's moving on. And Tom is happier. The Patriots letting him go. One hundred ninety ninth pick in the draft, the Brady six, the six guys drafted ahead him. He remembers all of it and that fuels him. The bust is your head. So obviously Tommy played there twenty years. He won six Super Bowls there. It's not going to change just because Bill Belichick doesn't think he can play anymore. I don't really know what that was all about, to be honest with you. I think that Tom wanted something different. He's been there a long time. Probably got a little tired of the. New England weather. As far as I feel I think he wanted to change and I think he wanted just to show that he can do what he did. Now they're becoming too confrontational to each other. They were starting to butt heads and with the media and everything else. Who was really bringing the championship? Who was bringing all the fame to the. Patriots? And they both have egos. And I think it was just a parting of ways, Bill Belichick wanted Garoppolo, wanted someone else instead of Tommy to show that: "Hey, my system works with anybody." I think Tom took offense to it. Tom goes: "Well, you know, my contract's up. I'm going to go, let me find the right area. Tampa Bay. We're going to build a winner there... I mean, you know, those are two guys maybe who found theirselves like, who just belong together like a rock band. They were together and they we're super successful. And when they split, you see okay, who still has it? Yeah, I feel really good. It's been you know, again, it's the first time in 14 years I haven't had to wear a knee sleeve. I mean, every picture I've had since for 14 years has been a knee sleeve. And in games, I'll still wear a knee brace just because I still want to protect you know, from kind of a vulnerable spot for a quarterback, you know, your front left knee. But it's just nice to practice and feel like I can just kind of put a pair of shorts on and run out to practice. And it's good though, I'm feeling, like I said, physically feeling great, mentally in a good place. A player at the age of 30 might be older in terms of orthopedic structures, but he has a lot more experience to see situations that he can avoid and to play the game more economic than a younger player does. Being at the age of forty three is not a prerequisite to get overuse injuries. It depends on your state of training and depends on your physical state. So there are as many players that get overuse injuries at the age of 18 and there are as many players to get overuse injuries at the end of twenty five. So an overuse injury depends on several factors. And that's: How you perform your sports? How do you move? How economic to move? How well-trained is your body and so forth. I saw that he's doing things differently with his nutrition, you know, he would have his meals prepared and always eat something that looked very healthy. You know, we might be over here taking advantage of Fat Friday and eating some burgers or eating some pizza. You know, he would always stick to his regimen and just be super disciplined about everything. Right. There's no, don't get into TB 12 thing. When he was young, he drank beer and eat pizza, too, just like everybody else. The man eating avocado ice cream, for God's sakes. Who the hell eats avocado ice cream? If I would want some ice cream I want some real ice cream. But that's what it comes to in sports. It's, you spend a million dollars a year on taking care of your body. Tom's TV 12 method with the pliability that's showing you a different way where you can last a lot longer in sports without all the rehabilitation, without the drugs, without that. And so he's been able to do his whole career and last this long without any of that. So, you know, it's the stretching, the pliability, keeping your muscles nice and loose all the time to prevent injury. That's what always worked for him. And I think that's amazing. I would definitely pass that on to my football players, you know, as they go through in their careers. But I love that he's standing for that and showing natural ways to take care of yourself, other than the ways that a lot of us know. And what Tom always believed in the TB 12. My muscles have to be more supple. If I'm going to play to a longer age, if I'm going to play through injuries, my muscles can't be all tight, rigid. They have to be more fluid. The TB 12 method will not change the way the sport will be played. The owners are worried about cash, money talks. Preseason games make money. More I can do, the better. More times I can put the product in front of the people, the better. The players, on the other hand, are saying: " Hey, you already know who your starters are. We need more recovery time and more game time. We don't need all that preseason stuff. That's great for the rookies." But now the older guys, more seasoned guys, people who've been around for a while, they're the ones that are saying: "Hey, no, we need more time off." Years and years ago, I saw in Sport magazine, which doesn't even exist anymore a survey and they asked. Olympic athletes, if you could win a gold medal, but you knew that it would cost you to the point where you would be dead in five years. Would you make that pact? The majority of them in this poll said YES! Oh my goodness. That just tells you how desperate people are to be champions and I think maybe they think that wouldn't really happen so, you know, unless you're going to be held to it, you know, you're not getting it completely truthful answer. But it amazes me that anybody would put their health on the line, especially their life and death health on the line. The bottom line is in the NFL, your job is there to be taken. And I think that's the fear that motivates more than anything. If I don't play hurt, they'll get somebody else who will play and also play hurt. Okay, the reason why they protect quarterbacks, you know, with the rules is because they're getting paid the most amount of money. So if you have a guy who is making 30 million dollars, I mean, do you want that guy hurt and sit in a medical tent or you want him on the field? All those people in the stands are paying the money to come watch him play. So that's why the rules protect the quarterbacks. If he goes down, nine times out of ten, the team going down so you can not hit the quarterback in practice, you can not even get close to the quarterback in practice. If you think you're getting close to the quarterback in practice, stop. Because you will get a lesson by the coach. If I met Tom Brady today, I would have a big smile on my face, I'd give him a hug, say he's been a great influence on my family, my friends. And then he would look at me and say: "What happened to you? You used to be so thin." When I saw him two years ago, three years ago in Boston. It's exactly what he said. He goes: "Coach - I probably gained 40 pounds since then. He goes: "What happened?" I go: "Hey, I got older. And two, the TB 12 system doesn't work." I mean, this game is about winning. I mean, you know, we can give stats for all sorts of people and he's going to end up having all the stats, too. But I mean, this game's about winning. He is part of the reason why the. Patriots are the Patriots. But afterwards, when Tom Brady left the team and went to Tampa Bay, he won the Super Bowl ring. When I heard that he would be a free agent at the end of the year, I knew he wouldn't be there anymore because how does a guy who's been that important, you know, for your organization, how are they free? How are they not contractually bound to being with you? And, you know, whether Tommy wanted out or whether Bill wanted him to go is really a moot point. You know, the point is that he was free and he went somewhere where he thought he had a better chance of winning the Super Bowl. And how'd that work out? Congratulations to the Bucs. It's been a long time coming man. Y'all made history tonight and we champs. Great. It was amazing watching the Bucs win a Super Bowl. This is great for Tampa Bay area. Brady is like a savior for Tampa. We needed him. Thank God Brady. Go Bucs! Yeah, we spent a lot of money to come down here to see our favorite team and favorite player Patrick Mahomes. And it was disappointing. We got shocked. Tom Brady's the G.O.A.T. What you wanna do? Well, when he went to the. Buccaneers, they were the worst organization in the NFL since 1976. And he won a Super Bowl in a Covid-season and beat the new golden boy in the NFL, Pat Mahomes. There was the game where they lost and he threw a couple of picks and he threw a pick because it was a miscommunication with the receiver. I said, you have to understand, he is using this now to get himself right and get to know all these players, because if the chemistry's right, he's going to do it. I knew it. And then he won the Super Bowl. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers managed to keep all 22 starters on offense and on defense, he's got the same group of guys around him and you can bet that Tom Brady is going to keep them motivated. And he's probably already talking about: "Ey, nobody is going to expect us to repeat. So let's show it to everybody that we can repeat and let's, you know, create history here in. Tampa and do something that was never been done in Tampa." So I think there's a good chance for him to hold the trophy again in twenty twenty two. His leadership is so different. And I think he, if you get to the playoffs and have somebody like him, your confidence boosts so high that you automatically play at your best level. Did you see how the defense played the Super. Bowl, what? His presence is so great. And I think having him on the team is like, if you play Madden and you play "ultimate team" and you have these cards that have like you can boost and he's like an absolute booster. The funniest thing that I've ever seen Tom Brady do was after they won the last Super Bowl and they had a boat parade in Tampa down the Hillsborough River. It's a nice, warm day. The players had their shirts off. They were horsing around. They were having a good time they're probably having a beer or two. And everything's going along and everybody's waving and everybody's happy. And then Tom Brady decides to underhand the Super Bowl trophy to the boat behind him and one of the receivers there catches it. And when you watch him do this, you thinking this is insane, the Super. Bowl trophy is going to go glug, glug, glug to the bottom of the river. But he completed that pass too. But it was a moment where, I mean, I thought it was staged, but Tom Brady did it. And it was good for some laughs, that's for sure. You know what, how long Tom Brady will play is the million dollar question. If he loses, no, because he'll want to come back and win. If he wins, no, because he wants to show that he could do it a third time. So, will it be his last season? No, he will come back no matter what, with a vengeance. Tom, it's 103 degrees out here, you seven Super Bowls. You still feel comfortable with your decision to come back? Well, it's I mean, it's really fun for me to you know, it's very fun. I love physically to train to put myself in a position to compete. You know, I love the mental aspect of the sport. And I have a lot of fun doing it. It's a lot of joy in my life. So, but I've got to keep earning it. You know, I don't think it's any aspect of me that thinks what I've done last year means anything. I've got to go do it this year. Going from there and having that mindset to keep going and then win a Super Bowl and win another, another and another and then win another one, then go to bucks and win another one within a year with a hew team. I think there's a lot to learn from that man. I think Tom Brady is playing only three more years to the max, he can't be played to 50. He's an... I don't want to say old man, but win another ring and then, call it, call it, call it. Before he retires? Yes, without question. He'll win another Super Bowl. Tom will get to eight minimum, minimum. Tom will win another Super Bowl. What will I tell Tommy when I see him next? First thing I would congratulate him on winning his seventh Super. Bowl. Tell him that I love him. And we started that dynasty in New. England. I think because I think that it's something big that we can learn, not only for sports, but for life in general to focus on, on what is possible and not all the things, or all the odds that are against us. I would totally agree with my kids taking Tom Brady as a role model from a guy that was not drafted very high, was drafted very late, to then rise up and become the biggest person in the game. Today's Tom Brady, I think, he doesn't get no pushback. You're talking to a man that has won seven Super. Bowls. What can you push back on him about? You're trying to learn from the best. Oh, there's no way Tom Brady is going to be a football coach. He might become a president. His aspirations are a lot higher than being a football coach. I see him being a CEO of a company. But he does like politics, so it would not shock me and to be honest with you right now, if he ran, he'd probably have a chance to win. Tom Brady for president, has a good ring to it, but I think too many people hate Tom Brady as much as they like him. Tom Brady. Let's kill Brady. He's the most hated quarterback. Because he's the best quarterback. Tom Brady never looked back. He's got an incredible ability to focus on whatever he's doing at the time. He took it upon himself to work really hard. Just that drive to be the best that he could be. Tom Brady is a winner. He will come back, no matter what. My favorite story about Tom Brady is definitely his answer to the question: "What is your favorite. Super Bowl ring?" And he said: "The next."
