♪ Soft music I still feel like I'’m spilling out of here. Are you kidding me? You haven'’t gained an ounce since college. It'’s perfect. Yeah, until my boob pops out in the middle of my vows. My mom is gonna have a stroke! This is your day, not hers. And you look amazing. Glenn is gonna be blown away. I'’m just glad you decided to give him up. Give him up? We had two dates, ten years ago. It was hardly an investment. But I did know that the two of you would click. Thank you. It'’s happening! Another? No man, one is for nerves. Two and I'’ll be slurring my vows. Better you than me. But if I ever decided to get hitched, it'’d be someone like Marci... They would never have you. They have taste. Maybe Chelsea? Come on man, you'’ve been after her since college. Just give it up already. I just want to be in position for when she makes her next mistake. Atta boy. ♪ Wedding March Please be seated. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of Glenn and Marci. With this ring, I thee wed. With this ring, I thee wed. With this ring, I thee wed. Do you promise to cherish and love him in joy and in sorrow, in sickness and in health, as long as you both shall live? I do. I do. I now pronounce you husband and wife. ♪ Upbeat pop music ♪ Hands up, if you wanna be free! ♪ ♪ We'll live it up like there's no tomorrow ♪ ♪ Whoa oh oh ♪ We'll live it up like there's no tomorrow ♪ ♪ Whoa oh oh Hey. Hi! I'’m getting tons of compliments on the dress and the earrings. I told you it looked great on you. And I got one last gift for you. Chelsea! It'’s in the hotel room. I know you'’d think it's excessive to buy for yourself, so I got you some lingerie from Cordella. Does it come with instructions? Stop it, you'’re gonna love them. He will love them. Now, can I get you something to drink? Just a water. Thank you. Hi mom. I just wanted to let you know I am really glad you'’re here. It means a lot to Glenn and I. I'’ve come here for you. I genuinely wish you happiness. I should let you get back to your guests. Thanks again for coming. Auntie, are you there? Auntie, is everything okay? Auntie? Sometimes I'’m very, very grateful that I have you. Me too. And that I was there to take you in all those years ago, because it was my brother'’s dying wish to take you away from that horrible woman he married. But apparently that wasn'’t enough to make you care about me or him, the way you always leave whenever the hell you want to, never doing your work! I was running an errand and I got, umm, caught in traffic... An errand? What errand? I had to get some fabric from the garment district. Did I send you there? Did I tell you to get fabrics? No, it'’s for me. I'’m making myself a dress. A dress, what for? Who are you trying to impress? I hope you'’re not acting up again. I'’m not. You always lie, so why am I wasting my time? Just finish the alterations. Go! Yes, Auntie. And be back before the five o'’clock fitting! I will! Whoa! You okay? You saved me. Let'’s not give me too much credit. Thank you. Is this the Kravitz house? I gotta drop these off, so... Yeah... Yeah, okay. Stay safe. Oh, I'’m so sorry. I'’m sorry. Hey, it'’s Marci, right? I'’m so sorry, I'’m drawing a blank? It'’s Jenna. I work for Aunt Daisy. Your wedding dress. Oh my gosh, yes! Yes, of course. If you could'’ve seen how many compliments I got on the day. Thank you. It was our pleasure, of course. Um, so how did the wedding go? Umm, oh it was great. Yeah, I don'’t know where to begin. It was good! How'’s Glenn? That'’s his name, right? Yeah. He'’s fine, he's good. Good. Honestly, before him I never imagined myself as a bride. I had kind of given up on the whole traditional marriage thing, you know what I mean? Not really. I'’ve always imagined I'd meet the perfect man and, you know, have a dream wedding. But I don'’t get the chance to meet many single guys, especially in my profession. Well if you can break away from your schedule, my friend Chelsea - my maid of honor - is throwing Glenn and I a little honeymoon luau. There will be lots of single guys there! I could introduce you! Yeah! Oh! You scared me. The only reason a woman exercises is she'’s trying to get over a man, or land one. And we definitely know it'’s not the former. So, what'’s the story? I'’m just, just trying to stay healthy. We sit hunched over at our desks all day and the last thing I want is-- --is to become like me. Hmm? I didn'’t say that. Yeah. You think you can just find a man and get me out of your life and take this house away from me, huh? You'’ll always be in my life. I bet you'’re counting the days until I'’m not, but guess what missy? My genes, all the women on your father'’s side always live to be octogenarians, okay? Well then, I should be thankful. Except you'’re too much like your mother, too confused in your head, so I wouldn'’t count on it. Face it, nobody would ever put up with you. Especially a man. The only thing that you can count on is your work. So change your clothes and get back to it. So I was at the gym today and I ran into the girl who helped make my wedding dress. I thought you said she was kind of old. No, not Mrs. Kravitz, her niece who works with her, Jenna. She'’s about our age. She'’s really nice, so I invited her to the party on Saturday. Cool. She'’s kind of shy, so I thought about introducing her to Scott. Really? Yeah. You know, someone like him might help her break out of her shell. You'’re just asking for trouble if you want my humble opinion. Speaking of which, did your mom make it home okay? Yeah. Did she say anything? About your dad not showing up? Nope... Hey, it'’s his loss. Yeah, his loss... You know maybe if I had just forgiven him for cheating and gotten my mom to follow suit, but... but he just devastated her. We are not your parents. I love you. I love you too. Face it, nobody would ever put up with you! Especially a man. You'’re too much like your mother, you'’re too confused in your head. You being you... You can'’t get me out of your life! Why thank you, Glenn. It'’s good to see you again as well. Just a few more curls... and then we'’re perfect. Yes, that'’s right... the 12th, it'’ll be ready, don'’t you worry... Okay... That sounds fine. We'’ll see you then, okay? Buh-bye. You made it! I did, yeah. It took some convincing, but Auntie finally gave me the day off. Auntie? You call her Auntie? That is so regal. Yeah, I guess. It'’s just what I've always called her. The bartender is making a helluva daiquiri. Can I get you one? A wine, please. Strawberry'’s the best. I'’m getting you a strawberry one. Come on! Cute dress! Where'’s that from? I did it myself last night. Now that is certainly a talent that I would love. Cheers. Cheers. So, I know you'’re single and I think I found the perfect guy for you. Really? Yes! His name is Scott, he was Glenn'’s best man at our wedding. He'’s super cute, the life of the party. He'’s standing right behind you. He seems busy. I'’ll give you a proper introduction later. Okay. That was Chelsea, right? She was with you when you came in for your measurements. Yeah, but she'’s totally not into him. It'’s so nice of her to throw this party. Her house is beautiful. You all seem so close. Oh! I need to go say hi to someone. Are you okay here for a minute? I'’ll be fine. Okay, I'’ll just be a minute. Don'’t I know you from somewhere? I-- The dressmaker! Yeah. How'’s married life? You know, it'’s not exactly what I thought it would be. You two seem so perfect together. Sometimes I feel like we'’re putting on a front for our friends and family. That we'’re not really soul mates. I'’m so sorry to hear. You know, I think about the moment we met. Maybe we missed an opportunity. I'’ve been hurt in the past when I tried to get close to someone. I'’ll never hurt you. Then how would this work? Anyone that might detract from us, you'’ll just have to do some things. Unpleasant things. Do you think you can do that for us? I do. Do you need a top up? Uh, no thank you. So, how do you know the lovely wedded couple? I'’m friends with Marci. I'’m Jenna. Oh, you'’re the girl from the golf course. Marci told me about you. She was not kidding. What did she say? That there was this woman I should meet, who'’s smart and attractive. But that she needed a little help believing that. So uh, do you want me to help you so you can understand just how attractive you really are? I think I'’ll go find Marci. Now. It was nice meeting you... we'’ll talk later. What? What is it you wanted to show me? It'’s in here. We won'’t be long, honey. We can'’t ignore our guests. Come on, this is what newlyweds do! We'’re on our honeymoon. Hey, I was looking for you. I was looking for you too, actually. Really? Yeah, I feel like I was rude earlier and I'’m sorry if I was. Not at all. I can handle rejection. Did I reject you? You walked away, so... Technically you never asked me a question I could say no to. What are you doing right now? I was umm, thinking about leaving. Me too. Wanna get out of here together? No. Now that'’s a rejection, right? Why don'’t you follow me to my place? Okay. Hey! Here we are. Okay. And right through here. After you. Thank you. You got it. All right, you ready? Here we are. Chateau Scott. This way. You umm, have a nice place. Very manly. Some are not into my taste. Well, I hate judgmental people. Me too. Please, a wine would be fine. You'’ll like this, trust me. What is it? It'’s bourbon. For Glenn'’s bachelor party, we toured some Kentucky distilleries and this was my favorite. Anything less harsh? Usually I'’d consider this a sin, but it'’ll help take the initial sting out for a rookie. Well, I hope I'’m not offending you. No, it'’s fine. It'’s good. Dad said it would put hair on your chest. Hey... Do you feel like playing a game? I'’m horrible at games. No, no. This way. This is a game where even if you lose, we both can still win. See, it'’s not just about being the one to not knock over the tower, because certain pieces have a dare. A challenge for the players. For example... Player One, please remove one piece of clothing. You think you can handle this? I think I'’ll need another first. No ice. Okay... Cheers. Cheers. So? Jenna? You never answered my question. Can you handle this? The game? It'’s just... I'’ve never done anything like this before. Don'’t worry. We'’re just having a little bit of fun. Now... Ladies first. Read it. Player One must kiss another Player. Oh no, darn the luck. I guess that has to be me. Close your eyes. I won'’t bite. Unless you ask me to. What? What happened? What'’s wrong? I think I need to leave. I think I'’ve done enough. I need to leave. Whoa, wait. Did I do something to offend you? I said I need to leave! Dammit. Hey, Jenna! Help! Help me! Hello? He wouldn'’t let me leave! I wanted to go, but he wouldn'’t let me leave. Jenna? Jenna, slow down. Who wouldn'’t let you go? Scott! Where are you now? In my car. You'’re safe? I think. I don'’t think he followed me. Okay, I want you to come over to my house. Okay. Other side. Here. Thank you. Do you want to talk about it? I'’m just so embarrassed. I was so stupid. No. Don'’t be, this isn'’t about you. This is about him. I know I shouldn'’t have, but I went over to his place after the barbecue thinking we'’d just... relax and have a drink. You know, it was innocent enough until he wanted to play this game. This game where if you remove a block-- I know that game. That stupid-ass ploy. He'’s been doing that since college. I can'’t believe he'’s still doing that. And I had to kiss him, but when I did and pulled away, he said, that'’s not the rules of the game. Why are you being so weird and such a prude? Why are you being so uptight? Hey, it'’s okay. The game saved me. If it hadn'’t fallen over when we struggled and distracted him, I don'’t know what would have happened. You have to go to the police. But he'’s your friend. No friend of mine does this. He needs to get what he deserves. I'’m so sorry I suggested that the you two of you should go out. That'’s Glenn. He was returning some party rentals. Oh my god, what happened? Someone beat up her up. I can see that. Scott beat her up. Are you serious? They went out tonight and he assaulted her. Okay, I know Scott, he would not do something like that. Well then how do you explain it? There must be some other explanation. It just doesn'’t make any sense. It'’s not that far fetched. You know how aggressive he gets. He probably drank too much. Aggressive doesn'’t mean violent! So you want to blame her? Blame the victim? No, I am not saying that! Then what'’re you saying? Just let me go talk to him. No! He can'’t know that she'’s here. He'’ll start stacking up the sandbags and she'’s already worried about pressing charges. Just... He doesn'’t believe me. He'’s angry... No. When someone is so close to someone, it'’s hard to face the truth. I hope so. Come here. It'’s okay. What'’s this? Can'’t sleep? I was looking for a glass for some water. Are you feeling better? I think I'’m gonna leave. It'’s... it'’s in the middle of the night. I have work, a lot of work. I think you need to take care of yourself. Work will help. Yes, I think it'’ll help. You need to be in bed. That'’s okay. Thanks for everything. Okay, well... let me know if you need anything! Where have you been all day and night? With friends. Ha! You don'’t have any friends. I do, too. If you stopped criticizing me for once and actually asked me about my life, then maybe you'’d know. Oh, I know. I know, you'’re doing it again. Otherwise why'’re you dressed like that? I'’m not doing anything! It'’s just a dress. Whoa, whoa, whoa! What'’re all these bruises from? Who is it? I don'’t know what you'’re talking about. Is it one of my clients? Just leave me alone! You don'’t fool me, missy! You better watch out because you'’re skating on thin ice! Alright, I'’m coming, I'’m coming. Damn, man... You wanna tell me about last night? Good morning to you, too. What the hell are you talking about? Jenna? Oh, yikes. So you guys did get together? Not really. What'’s not really? She came over, had a drink, I tried to get her to play the game, she kinda freaked out and left... What would cause her to freak out? Hell if I know. We'’re making out, suddenly she got cold feet and ran away. That'’s it? Yeah, that'’s it. What'’s all this about? She came over to our place after she left here last night. Somebody really did a number on her. That'’s horrible. Yeah, she said you did it. What? I mean she'’s lying, making it up. I barely laid my hands on her. Laid your hands? No, not like that. We were going at it, making out. When she stood up, I grabbed her hand, she pulled it away, knocked over the game and then she left. That was it. C'’mon man, you know I couldn'’t do something like that. Right? Yeah. I didn'’t know I had to convince you, buddy. You should see the bruises. It was somebody else, not me. Is Marci believing this garbage? You should probably keep your distance, all right? Jenna'’s not sure if she wants to file a report. And you just want me to wait until she does? No way. She'’s lying! What'’re you gonna do? I won'’t let her get away with it. I'’ll fight it. Jenna, you have a visitor! Okay... Glenn? Hey... Why are you lying? Why are you saying those things about me? I'’m not. You know what you did! I didn'’t touch you! Oh yeah? Then how do you explain this? Maybe you did it yourself! Oh sure, blame the victim. That'’s what you men always do... If you don'’t quit claiming this BS, I will sue you for defamation and for slander! If you don'’t leave, I'’m calling the police! Go ahead, I have nothing to hide. Then the world will see what a complete psycho you are! What'’s going on? Nothing. Nothing, I'’m outta here. I warned you, I warned you. But you don'’t listen, you go behind my back and do things... And now this. More trouble. You'’re just like your mother. I told my brother, I - watch out for her. But he went ahead and married her anyway. And then she killed him... she killed him... Daddy deserved it. What did you say? He was a monster, just like you! Don'’t you dare talk about your father that way... Mama and me, we barely got away and then she died and all I had left was you. But you'’re no better! Am I supposed to stand here and take this? From an ugly, pitiful, ungrateful little child like you? Who has nothing! Who is worthless! And now you'’re bringing evil on this house... I won'’t have it. I want you out now! Go! You can die in the street just like that piece of trash you called Mama! Stop! Stop it! Stop it! I can't thank you enough for being here today. It means the world to us. But now we must be going. He's sweeping me off to Hawaii for two weeks. Yes, it's all very much a dream come true. You ready honey? Yes, yes I am. There'’s no need to be nervous. Who said anything about being nervous? I love you. I love you. I love you! Hey. I didn'’t expect you home so soon. You talked about a day full of errands. I know. I was in the middle of it. I just-- I just feel terrible about Jenna and Scott. Listen, why don'’t I take you out to an early dinner? We can just talk about everything. That actually sounds great. Hey, I got this. You go do what you need to do. Okay, thank you. What'’s this? You tell me. Are you going on a sleepover somewhere? Do not make a joke about this! About what? I don'’t know what this is. This? This is lipstick. On your pillow. And this is not my color. I would not wear this shade. There'’s some cheap scent on these sheets. Can you explain this please? I can'’t. And I don'’t like what you'’re implying. Listen, I know we'’re going through this thing and you may have grown up with some trust issues-- Oh, that'’s not fair! But I didn'’t expect to be accused of cheating in our first month of marriage. Especially since I didn'’t do anything! You know what? Let'’s not worry about going out tonight. I'’ll find my own dinner. Ow! Come in, it'’s open. Hey sweetie! If you'’re here to see if I'’m free for lunch, I don'’t think I can sneak away. I have a client coming. Yeah, I bet you'’ve done enough sneaking around all week. Excuse me? You found it, thank god! I thought that I lost this. I was dreading saying anything to you. I found it in Glenn'’s pants. What? That'’s weird. Is it? Were you at our house yesterday? With Glenn? Are you really suggesting that I'’m having an affair with Glenn? With my best friend'’s husband? You tell me. I know you still had a thing for him. No, I haven'’t. I handed him off to you. Oh, handed him off? Like sloppy seconds? You better take a breath, before I really get upset. Recognize those? I found them in our bed. Where were you yesterday? I don'’t know what'’s going on here. Answer the question. If you think that I would risk our friendship for an affair with Glenn, that says a lot-- Answer the question! You need to leave. Come back when you become a little more rational. I think I am quite rational! What are the odds that another woman has the same earring and underwear? Maybe your husband has a panty fetish. And maybe he'’s a thief! Hey... Hi. Please come in. You didn'’t have to do this. It'’s just a small thanks. So after I stormed out of Chelsea'’s place, I gave Glenn a chance to come clean, but he denied it. So I asked him to leave. And he did... The wedding just seems so distant now, with everything that'’s happened. You know, it'’s not much of a consolation, but I'’m really grateful that we became friends. Me, too. I can'’t stop thinking about my mom... for the past 20 years she knew my dad was cheating on her, but she didn'’t do anything about it. She couldn'’t leave and I thought, what self-respect does she have? But now that I'’m in this situation, I don'’t know what I'’m gonna do. Do you think you could ever trust him again? I know I couldn'’t. My darling Glenn, I guess it was only a matter of time. After our fun little afternoon escapade at your house, we were bound to be discovered. But now that we are, we can tell Marci how much we'’ve been in love since grad school. No more hiding, no more sneaking around. It'’s our time. With all the love in my heart, Eternally yours, Chelsea. What the hell? What are you doing in my house? On my computer? Marci! She sent me. You were sleeping with Glenn. And she wanted hard evidence. So she sent me. Bull. I'’m calling the police. Smile! Be right there. Chelsea? Chels? Chelsea? No foreplay? I'’m glad you finally got tired of playing hard to get. A Detective Moreno called me? You Glenn Cooper? Right this way, please. Hey. Hi there. Thanks for coming. There is no next of kin, but you were listed on his cell phone under favorites. Can you tell me what this is about? Your friend is dead. Here? Where'’s Chelsea? I'’m afraid she'’s dead, too. I don'’t understand. Can I get you some water or something? This is gonna destroy Marci. Marci? Yeah, she'’s my wife. She'’s Chelsea's best friend. Can you tell me what happened? It looks like Ms. Allen invited Mr. Harrison over for some adult activities. There was an altercation. He stabbed her and she shot him. Their relationship, was it volatile? I didn'’t even know they had a relationship. I mean, he was always hitting on her and she wanted nothing to do with it, or at least she acted that way. She had texted him to come over here. She had even composed a love letter to him. That doesn'’t make any sense. This whole thing, it just doesn'’t make sense! I'’m sorry. I'’m sorry, I have to go. Yeah. When I'’m finished here, I'd like to come by and talk some more. And your wife. You always know how to kill a mood. Ashes to ashes... flush to flush. Bye daddy. Honey, the detective'’s here. I'’ll be there in a minute. Can I get you something? I'’m fine, thanks. I appreciate you sitting down with me like this. Whatever we can do to help. Have either of you ever known them to be violent? No. Nothing like this. Tell him. Tell me what? Scott was-- Marci! Let her speak. Scott had an incident last week. He beat up a woman that we know. He denied it. Was this reported? No, she was struggling with that after he came and threatened her. So no, she did not report it. All right, so who is this she? We'’re here to help, so if you have any more questions. I appreciate it. I'’ll just see myself out. I can'’t believe this is happening... Neither can I... I lost a best man and you lost a best friend. Yeah, who was cheating on me with my husband. We were not having an affair! What do I have to do to prove that? Yeah well, explain the lipstick and the sheets. And the earring and the panties. Maybe it was a joke or they were pranking us? If it was a stupid prank, she would have told me when I went to confront her... You'’re right. I just don'’t want to go through this alone. I promise you this... We can get through this, we can clear up this up. Together. Just let me be with you. I love you. Good morning. Good morning. You'’re Jenna Kravitz? Yeah. Detective Moreno. Everything alright? Yeah, yeah, I was just rushing to answer the door. Ah. Well, I'’m here to talk about Scott Harrison. Mind if I come in? Oh yeah! Thank you. Thank you for coming out here today, Detective, but I'’m not filing a report. So something happened between you and Mr. Harrison? I'’d rather not talk about it. Security footage in front of his place shows you crying for help. Look, I don'’t care whether you file or not, I just need to know what happened. He made an inappropriate advance and when I said no, he went into a rage and attacked me. I think he was frustrated about what happened earlier in the day. What was that? This woman, Chelsea, had rejected him at her party and I don'’t think it was the first time. Maybe mine was one too many for him. So he took it out on me. So Scott and this Chelsea, they have a history? Oh yes! I haven'’t been friends with them long, but they seem to have this weird game going on. I think she really enjoys toying with him. I don'’t think she realizes how much it drives him crazy. So you haven'’t heard? Heard what? I'’ve been stuck in here the last few days working. I think that went well, don'’t you? Despite the fact that you were being such a snoop! How you doing? I'’m good... Is this some sort of joke? What are you doing here? No! No! No! Hey. I'’m sorry to bother you. No, it'’s no bother. I'’m assuming you talked to the police? Yes. Listen, I'’m sorry but... I had to say something because, well, two people are dead... No, it'’s okay. I would have done the same thing. Frankly, I'’m more worried about you. I mean, Chelsea was your best friend. I'’m still trying to make sense of it all. Nothing makes sense to me. Me neither. And I don'’t know about you, but I keep having these nightmares. I keep thinking about Scott and how that could'’ve been me. You know, he could'’ve killed me. Listen Jenna, he'’s gone. He'’s not gonna hurt you again, okay? I just wish these feelings would go away. Do you want me to come over? It would do me some good to get out. As long as it doesn'’t cause any trouble. Trouble? Yeah, for you and Glenn. I know he'’s mad at me about what I said about Scott. No, don'’t worry about him. This will just be between you and I. He'’s got enough on his mind. Good. Oh, and before I forget, why don'’t you bring your wedding dress? My wedding dress? Yeah, it'’s for the preservation process. It'’s part of the package. Auntie told me to remind you... Right, okay sure. See you soon. Okay, bye. Let me take that. I'’ve set us up in here. Is your aunt around? I would like to thank her. Oh, she'’s out. Her weekly bridge game. A friend comes and picks her up. Oh. Yeah... tea? Tea is fine. It'’s a beautiful set. It'’s Auntie's. Like everything. So, how'’s Glenn doing? As good as anyone can in this situation, I guess. And you? Not as well. You know, I must admit I was a bit surprised that he moved back in with you after our conversation the other day. How did you know about that? Uh, you mentioned it on the phone earlier. I did? My head has just been really twisted. So how are you and Glenn doing? Well, he'’s swears that nothing is going on, so I'’m starting to believe him. And given the fact that Scott and Chelsea were found together, there has to be another explanation, right? Maybe she was sleeping with both of them? I don'’t think so... Your best friend dies and you just give him a free pass? I'’m not giving him a free pass. Can I just be honest? That is completely misguided. You can'’t let him back in, or you'’ll lose 20 years just like your poor mama. Thank you for your concern. I thought this visit was about you and your fears? Oh, yes. Thank you so much. What? What'’s wrong? Nothing. Your perfume? It'’s very distinctive. What is it? Sue-nelle. I'’ve used it for years. Oh... Thank you very much for the tea, that was lovely but I have to go. You'’re leaving? But I'’m not done talking. I haven'’t told you about all my problems. I know, there'’s just some... some arrangements that I have to make. Well you can'’t leave. I'’m not done talking and you'’re being quite rude. I have to go... So you can ruin everything? What are you talking about? You were never good enough for Glenn... It was you... Shhh, just go to sleep. Good girl. Oh, look! It'’s your lover. That'’s okay... he'’s mine! Leave a message! Call me as soon as you get this. No, it'’s not ready! Marci? Glenn? I'’m here! I'’m here! I'm here, I'’m gonna get you out! It'’ll be okay, Glenn. It'’ll be okay. Looks like somebody needs some more of Auntie'’s medicine. Oh don'’t worry, he'’ll be alright. I'’ll make sure he gets a happily ever after. Bye-bye. Okay, come on. Bye-bye, Marci. Marci? What the hell? Oh good, you'’re finally getting up. We have a big night ahead. Where'’s Marci? What did you do to her? Sadly, she'’s gone. What? The loss of her best friend and the inability to reconcile with her estranged husband led her to take her own life. Please somebody help me! Anybody, help! It'’s just us. Nobody can hear you way out here. But don'’t worry, I've taken care of everything. Just like we planned. I didn'’t plan anything with you. Of course you did. You think I could'’ve put all this together on my own? I love you. I want you to be my first. I want to be your wife and I know you want to be my husband. You'’re crazy. Why do men always say that? Men always demand so much and then when you show them just how much you love them, they call you crazy! I don'’t know how you could think I would agree to all of this-- Because you love me! You told me how much you want us to live a life together. Okay? Just wait. I'’ll be back in jiff! Oh, stop! Stop! Stop, you gotta stop! Geez, are you okay? You gotta take me down this hill. I gotta call the police, my husband'’s in trouble. Just down this hill. I hope you'’re ready for me! ♪ Wedding March This is insane! Shhh... it'’s starting. We do. Can we please stop this? It'’s okay to be nervous. Everybody gets nervous. It'’s just pre-wedding jitters. This isn'’t jitters! I don'’t want this! But you said that you loved me. I never said that! I love Marci. Don'’t say her name. I could never love someone like you! Don'’t say such things! Marci is my wife! Stop! Stop! Not you, not some pathetic dressmaker! Easy. I thought you were different. I thought things would be different. But you'’re ruining everything! I didn'’t mean to, okay? You just need some help. I need you. I love you. But you tied me up, you'’re forcing me to marry you. Do you know what it'’s like to know that there'’s someone out there you love but doesn'’t love you back? I can'’t live that way. We can talk about this. But you made your choice. In fact, you made it quite clear. Just calm down, okay? Maybe I can learn to love you. That'’s not love! I'’m sorry, Glenn. It'’s just the way it has to be. No, please! If you say anything... Okay? What do you want? What do you want? Marci? She'’s coming. Get out of here! It'’s okay. We'’re alone now, it'’s just us. Now, where were we? Where is she? I don'’t know what you'’re talking about. Maybe this will draw her out. It'’s over. I'’ve called the police, they'’re on their way. Auntie said it'’d never happen, but it did. I'’ve had my great love story. What're you talking about? He never loved you! For a little while, he did. And you can never take that away from me... Marci! Where is she? She was right here! Glenn... Come on, we'’ve gotta get out. Oh my god... How are you feeling, honey? Just happy to be home. You know, after we got married, I never carried you across the threshold. Really? You know, ancient cultures believed it would prevent bad luck and evil spirits. Oh really? Well I guess we'’d better do it. Yeah, you'’ve gotta turn and look at her. Yeah, ugh. Karen, I need the fifty mil. Karen, snap out of it. I need the fifty mil. All right, let'’s go again. Lots and lots of love now. Like that!
