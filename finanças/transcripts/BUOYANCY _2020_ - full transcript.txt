It's fascinating to see what we already have accomplished over the last 50 years or so. Everything is coming together. Neurology, psychology, quantum physics, AI. On a daily basis like he does. I know, I mean, Joe, I see this happening all the time and it frustrates me to see people not reach their full potential because of such a habit. Unconscious ideas are always the core of all psychological conflicts. So, isn't it strange that these large corporations control so much of our daily lives with their data? Well, how would you ethically restructure the vast amount of data that we have built up over the past decades? Well to begin, it's very different... The people are tired of hearing the media lie all the time, you see? - Why is that? - The left nor the right haven't provided any good solutions. That you... So, no but think of like tearing down a big city, like New York, just because you were scared of the things that might happen. If people wanted to stop the large corporations they should have done this years ago but they didn't. It started with radio, TV, internet, and now artificial intelligence. Be thankful that the good guys are coding. Hello, everyone and welcome back to my channel. So a quick update on my sociology course at uni. Yeah, I had a great day, today, actually. I was just super busy. I did four lectures, a meeting with my working group. There are so many variables that can influence social isolation. Fragile health, little opportunity to see other people, living on a small fixed income, there's disability and mental illness and also little transportation. So, these variables they have to be addressed to every individual. Let me know what you think in the comments below. And it's easy for you to say that I'm rich. But even though that's true, I believe that we can bring off the grid living to the masses. For people who seek adventures or want freedom and above all an economical and sustainable way of living in times like these. This is why I want to show to you the next generation of top level students, something new. I'm proud to present to you as one of the first, the T-O Xenia. A fully self providing electric submarine that can house up to four people. 2,000 miles action radius on a single battery. You want to go live on a tropical island, go there, autopilot. Or go for the arctic expedition, while you still can. Just do it. But the most exciting of all, you want to live in the place with no distractions, hassle free from society, welcome to the 70% this planet still has to discover, the water. Thank you. Amelia, have you got a minute? Yeah, sure. Have you looked into the graduation companies I sent you? Yeah, kind of. I don't think it's something for me, to be honest. These are good, high quality companies, Amelia and they're dying to meet you. I know but do you really see me researching AI systems like the rest of these idiots? I feel like I can do more. For the Hallberg Foundation, you mean? Have you been reading the papers? Mrs. Tyche, that's all speculation. You heard him talk. It's exactly the direction I want to be going in. Plus, attaching such a name will boost my chances of being published dramatically. Student affairs isn't easy to convince, Amelia. But you can help, right? I got to go now, sorry. Please, just tell me that you'll look into the companies, okay? Yeah, sure. Dear Mr. Hallberg, thank you for approving my graduation proposal. I know this is an unusual way of researching but I strongly believe the information we can retrieve on these topics are of great value. After reading your book, The Power of Solitude, I deeply connect with the philosophy you provide in terms of future proofing our society for social isolation. You will definitely not regret this. Sincerely, Amelia. Thank you tuning in again. This week I will be talking about something that I haven't talked about for awhile now. Would the world be ready for a new enlightened generation? Is it possible that our brains have been given so much information over the past decades that we're ready to transform into something higher? These type of new leaders, let's call them humanity upgraders, they see no greater purpose in life but to be of services, genuine as they can, and to learn as much as they can. This fundamental shift in perspective of seeing your life as something for your safety and comfort. To seeing your life as an abundant, adventurous school of learning, is essential and the key to start your journey. Hey, there, how was your trip? Fine, thank you. Well, all ready to go for you. So this is it, huh? Well no need to be contemptuous. I didn't mean it like that. I was just joking to you. It's a prototype. Are you ready? Let me help. On you go. Welcome aboard. Welcome, Amelia. Please enter. So welcome. Our small lounge area. This is the kitchenette, it's got a food supply. Food should last us well over a month. Definitely enough for the few days we're together. It's a shared space so I thought we could set up the interviews here. It's not much but for now. It's more than enough. Thank you. Let me show you your room. So, here's your room. Again, not much, but I hope you can feel comfortable. Mattress for you. I normally use it as a gym but feel free to use the punching bag. I'm not sure if you have tried boxing? Oh yeah, I love boxing. It will be nice to still get some exercise. Well, I'll show you the bathroom later. You must be tired, so. The WiFi's over there. Just bear mind there's almost no signal underwater and this is your key. Just scan it to open and close. Let me know if you need anything else. Thanks, I will. Door closing. What the... I didn't know we were going already. Oh hey, yeah. I just inserted the coordinates. We'll be going a few miles south to visit a friend of mine, I hope you don't mind, we'll be back in time. No worries. So, who's driving this thing? It all runs on AI. We are currently going southwest at 200 feet. I'm sorry, I'm used to diving alone and you were sleeping. Next time I'll tell you when we leave, all right? Nevermind. Where's the shower? That will be the last door to the right. Access denied. Hi, guys. This is my first update from the T-O Xenia. We've just started moving and tomorrow we'll begin the first interview session. I'm gonna be recording these vlogs to show my progress during the time of this research. Really is strange to see the months of preparation finally going into action. Hopefully, these short journals will give you more of an insight into my final thesis. Looking forward to sharing this journey with all of you. Well, Mr. Hallberg. I am Detective Ethan Campbell and I've been assigned to your case, lucky me. Just for the record, these interviews are being recorded so anything you say or do can and will be used against you in a court of law. Is that understood? Mr. Hallberg, looking at this case, we have got quite a considerable amount of work to do. It will be beneficial to all concerned if you cooperated. Mr. Hallberg? Mr. Hallberg! Understood. Human body doesn't need a lot to survive and stay healthy. Just the basics. Humans can go on for months, do you know that? Shall we start? Time, 9:03. First interview with Mr. Hallberg. Please, can you briefly introduce yourself and state that you are cooperating in this research. Well, I'm sorry but I haven't seen one of these in like ages. Where did you get it? Sorry, I jumped right in. It was my grandmother's, actually. She was a reporter at a local newspaper. I mean, how do you store everything? An app should be more efficient than this? I transcribe and then store the tapes in my closet back home. Fascinating. Most people think I'm crazy but I like working with it and it can't be hacked in any way shape, or form. That's a plus these days. I'm very sorry, shall we start over? I am Nicholas Hallberg, I'm the founder of Alcom X. I sold the company a few years ago to Apple and then started a new company called The Hallberg Foundation. We focused on migration and the sustainability of our planet and I'm fully cooperating with you on this research thesis on the effects of solitude and new technology. Thank you, Mr. Hallberg. After you sold your first company, Alcom X, you told the NY Times that the, the quote, commercial shark in you had passed away and a new philanthropic panda had taken its place. How do you respond to public opinion that despite your new company's philanthropic mission statement you're still profiting from the people less fortunate in this world? Wow, that's what you learned at university? Attack right after the introduction? Sorry, must be the nerves. Well, after the amount of money I made over the last decade you might say it's easy just to sit back, relax, do nothing but I don't want to just enjoy every single golf course in this planet. I want to make a big difference in the world and for that, you need to take a risk and sometimes, even if your gut says no. Okay, yeah but doesn't this type of... Can I have a look at the question you prepared because I am not recalling any of these. No, I'm can't, sorry. Okay. All right, we'll let's call it a day, shall we? Maybe you can recognize some of the questions so we have a better interview structure next time? Hi, everyone. Day one and I've just finished the first interview session with Mr. Hallberg. All went well, I think I just need to restructure a few questions, put them in later on in interview sessions. I think I need to get to know Mr. Hallberg a bit better in order to get the answers that I really want. But I'm positive about the potential relationship we have. There are just so many topics to cover so I think I'm gonna focus more on personal experience. So strange to think that we are already so far from home, so deep underwater. No internet connection. Just us, this metal thingy. Tons of water. I think the feeling will go away. I mean, Mr. Hallberg's lived here for quite some time. It can't be that bad, right? Okay, that's it for today. Like and subscribe if you want to see more videos. You know how they say that even the worlds best yachtsman don't even know how to swim? Just the knowledge of knowing how to swim would torment them, if they had fallen overboard. But doesn't physic not fall apart under huge amounts of stress? Another complex, more autonomous parts of the brain take over? You've been reading your Jung, yes, but you see we all want to get more knowledge. We never seem to wonder if there's a limit or a path of not knowing that very well could be better for your psyche. And so what type of knowledge would you rather not know? You come across as a very self aware individual. Excellent question. Well, for instant, art. I collect paintings, I can enjoy a nice piece of art but I don't need to know how it is made. It either touches me or it doesn't. And isn't that part of the fascination, you know, knowing how much effort someone has put in? But does it matter? I mean, all art should do is like to make the unconscious content accessible and therefore bring it closer to the understanding of the viewer, the therapeutic effect of that could be to prevent a dangerous splitting off of the unconscious process of the consciousness. Thanks for today, Nicholas. We made a lot of progress and we even got on to some topics that aren't on the agenda yet, so. No need to thank me all the time, I'm more than willing to help. Can I ask, ever you ever used any drugs before? I tried to smoke marijuana once but that didn't end so well, to be honest. Do you? Oh this. This is just something to keep me a bit more sane for when I'm away for awhile. What is it? It's an extract from a plant out of the Amazon, a little bit like ayahuasca but better taken care of. You don't need to spill your guts. You can try it if you want. No, thanks. If you can't go out to have fun you have to go inwards. Oh, you shouldn't take any caffeine with that. Just have some water. Just relax. Let yourself get carried away. It won't go where it doesn't need to go. What do you think is the most important thing in the world? Water. Correct. Strange, right? Nobody ever acted on this. No, people on Mars are way more important. What do you thinks the most important thing? Subconsciousness. So many years on this planet and we don't even understand one percent of it. Why we behave, why we explore, why we feel. We do, right? You think? Many studies have shown why we behave the way we do and why we have relations. Well, then explain to me why we cry sometimes. What's the function of crying, really? I mean, I understand for babies so we know when to feed it but for a grown up? Please, explain. Yeah, that's an interesting one. I would say that. I would say... I have to think. Maybe... You okay there? Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists. But I've learned that you are never too small to make a difference. Hey, stranger. How did you get into my room? What? Tell me. How did you get into my room? Well, we took drugs last night. I had to make sure that you were okay. Do you have access with your card? - Don't get paranoid... - Come on, tell me. Of course I have access. I mean, what if something happened and I have to get into the room? I don't want you coming into my room when I'm sleeping, okay? So you don't trust me? Not anymore, no. Look, you have to understand. This is a multimillion investment, okay? I have to have full control. Okay. So what are we gonna do? Are we gonna head back? I will reprogram the card, okay? So I don't have any more access. Privacy is a serious thing, okay? Nicholas? This isn't funny. Amelia. We're going up to get some air. If you want to use the internet. Hey, Amelia, how are you? Good, thanks. Yeah, how are you? Oh I'm fine, thanks. You look tired. I just took a shower. How's the research going? Very well, thanks yeah, we've already had some very interesting interviews and talks. I've even started a video journal for my personal development journey. Very well. It's good you're doing well. What is it? There's something I want you to see. A colleague of mine sent this to me two days ago, right after you left. Nothing new, right? Well, this time it seems serious. Police officials have said that three witnesses have come forward. Have you noticed anything strange aboard? No, nothing really. Well, if there is anything you'll tell me, right? Of course. I haven't noticed anything in particular. I've just been very busy preparing for the interviews. Good. Let's keep in... So, Mr. Hallberg, could you please give me full details of the events that went on onboard the T-O Xenia? Of course. As you may know, I invited Ms. Anderson to do some research onboard for her sociology studies. So you instigated the meeting? No, she wrote me a very compelling letter on which I agreed that this might be a very interesting approach for her graduation thesis. So, what did the two of you discussed? Well, a lot of things. She also seemed to like psychology and philosophy and we have that in common. I studied that to a great extent. My team is working round the clock studying all the CCTV footage from that submarine. When I look at the evidence, one big question comes to mind. Why were you filming Amelia? Well, Detective Campbell, this is a great investment of mine and I'm trying to protect it. Protect your investment? - Yes, indeed. - Protect your investment. There are at least three felonies that I can pin on you right now. The more you cooperate, the more we could help you. The media is gonna go crazy for a story like this. Let them. We also found this. Shall we leave this to the press as well? Wow. I mean, for someone going to Uni that is a silly thing to do. My friends are pretty crazy. I can see that, yeah. You miss them? Yeah, kind of. I could see why. They seem like a lot of fun. You want some more? The highs get less after awhile but it's still a nice vibe to get into. I'm okay, thanks. Do you miss having friends? That's personal. Sorry, I didn't mean it to be. It's okay. I see my friends from time to time. It's always relaxed. Grabbing a beer, catching up. When I'm with my family it's, of course, a different story. Yeah, I read about that. Sorry. It's... Eight years, already. So sorry to bring that up. It's okay. We were supposed to go on a big family holiday together after I was working for two years straight. My daughter was only five when she died. Must have been a terrible time for you. Yes. Well, this is when I knew I had to sell the company and start something meaningful for the world, you know. What about you? What's your family situation? I was raised by my mom and my dad died when I was little. I'm so sorry to hear that. Don't be. He was an asshole from what I heard. An alcoholic and he left my mom alone without any money. But I got pretty independent from an early age. I helped out with the chores and I saved up some money from part time jobs. Any brothers or sisters? No, just me. I always thought that it was my fault that my dad left. That I wasn't good enough. But later, I found out that he was the one having the issues. He couldn't cope with reality. Paranoid, personality disorder. Really tragic. No more interviews today, then? No, you can take it easy today, all right. I still have some work to do. Record podcast. Let's play one more game, okay. Pick a city in your mind right now, any city. You got one? Good. Well regardless of what city you picked would you think of this as an act of free will? And you have to ask yourself the first most important variable. How many cities do you know in the world? So. Your free will is already mislead by the fact that there's a limit to your knowledge on cities. Second, you could have picked any other city that you've been or read about but you didn't. So there is a certain aspect about this city that in came up in your subconscious that you have no control over but yet you think your free will decided on that city. You might say it was just a random pick but I am sure that you intellectual mind knows better. Everything that happened in your life from your birth, born with specific genetics in a certain demographic your family, relationships, everything. Right now, you're listening to this podcast. Everything has built up to this very moment and it will affect you. So whether you like it or not. There is no free will in the block universe. Past, present, and future are all one and cannot be changed. Past, present, and future are all one, cannot be changed. Now, repeat after me. If someone says. Can you have a look at something? Did you go through my shit? Sorry? You heard me. This was all folded. No. Don't lie to me. I thought I heard something. Right, you heard something. I thought I heard someone in here. Anyone in? Come on, seriously, have a good look. Anyone? No. All right, well don't go through my shit, okay? Go now. Hi, guys. I just had a quick chat with Nicholas and he thinks that I'm going through his stuff. Slight state of paranoia, I would say. I don't know why he thinks I'm going through his stuff but there's definitely something up. Can't really put my finger on it but it's just a feeling, you know? Sorry, this may all sound a bit vague at the moment but Nicholas keeps handing me these joints with some sort of hallucinating thing in it, makes me feel a bit clogged, you know? Anyway, plan for tomorrow keep doing the interviews. Still think I have to dig a bit deeper. Get more personal. This will be the core of my research. Hey. Hey. Shall we start? I would like to go more into the exact reasons for you to build this submarine. I think I've already told you that my company... No, I know you want to help the world but why do you do it? Living in complete solitude? Well, to start, it's easy for the mind. I don't need these distractions from the so called real world. The amount of stress you let into your body is a choice. Not many people seem to understand that kind of knowledge. We all want to just watch the latest show and buy the newest gadgets, go to that unique vacation spot that everybody has already been. Wear the latest fashion. It's all superficial stuff. Distraction for the ego where as you could stimulate your higher mind on a deeper level and let your consciousness, your subconsciousness grow. So, why can that only be achieved on a submarine? Surely, you could go to a meditation clinic? True but what happens after when you take back your bus or car? You get pulled in, right away into your daily dose of impulses from society. So, you're saying to reach a higher consciousness it can only be achieved without any distractions. Correct. And when did that journey of the mind start for you? It's hard to say. Around seven years ago. After the car accident? Have you ever taken a break from the real, Amelia? A break from the real? See, traumatic events are un-symbolized for the subject. Therefore, the subject cannot possibly recall these events. No matter how hard they try, they wouldn't overcome the void that is created by that trauma that they have undergone. What happens next is that fantasies created around this meaningless void and it's function to create an illusion of coherence. As a result, the traumatic event is perceived by the subject as something compatible for the rest of the subjects symbolic universe. But in reality, it is not. Would you say that you have had some traumatic event in your life? Not that I can recall of, no. Or maybe you haven't repeated it. I think I would have recalled something if it had changed my life. You see, the first thing that people notice when they start meditating is how uneasy they feel. They get confronted by their thoughts, the mind has to intervene immediately. Have you ever meditated? Yeah. I take yoga classes but haven't really felt that kind of enlightenment. I see. I would like to show you something. What I'm going to show you is my latest invention and I haven't shown it to anyone else. This is what they used to call a sensory deprivation tank. By closing off your hearing inside, all your other senses are all stimulated. I perfected the method by adding electrons and crystals that stimulate the body and mind even more. One hour in this tank will give you more insights into yourself than any top level shrink could give you in a year. Looks scary. What about all the wires? Well, these wires will be connected to your body and brain so we can monitor the current state you're in. Happiness, hope, fear, anger. All spectrums of emotions are built of in colors just like any light source. Sounds like a new age wet dream. Do you want to try? Floating sessions starts. Please enjoy. I don't know what's going on around here anymore. I keep hearing and seeing things. Images, memories, I don't know. I feel like I just want to run away but I can't, obviously. I don't know why I'm recording all this. My brain, it's, it's going in a loop, recurring thoughts, emotions, they just keep coming back. I don't even care about the research anymore. I just want to go home. I miss my friends. Fuck. I really miss my friends. Okay, let me sum this up for you. We've got the illegal drugs, the CCTV footage, the weird brain scan, and we've got the gun. Now, how does all that sound to you, eh? Let me tell you a story, Nicholas. Can I call you Nicholas? You know what, I don't care. Couple of years ago, my partner and I, we were given a big case. Missing girl. Country was going crazy about it. Media coverage everywhere. Jesus, we even had members of the public out looking for her. My partner discovers a link to a family member who was living abroad. So we called him in. Seemed like a reasonable guy. Couldn't really pin anything on him, so we let him go. Days went by, no new leads. Some of my colleagues even thought we'd never find the girl. Then my partner has, what we call in the job, a Columbo moment. He has a hunch. Wants to get this guy, this family member in for more questioning. So he goes out, alone, to this guy's house. As he gets to the house, the guys leaving so my partner decides to follow him. Follows him all the way out to the woods. The guy gets out the car, tries to put some distance between him and my partner. My partner follows him. The guy stops by this huge lake. Starts taking off all his clothes. My partner calls for backup because he thinks this guys gonna do himself an injury and that maybe we'll never find the girl. So my partner approaches the guy, tries to stall for time. He sees the guys crying. Really crying, not fake tears, not crocodile tears but really sobbing and the guy turns around and asks my partner for a hug. A fucking hug and my partner, the stupid bastard, he gives him a hug and that's when the guy pulls a knife and he stabs my partner in the back 12 times. So you see in this life, I'm not afraid of any Muslim terrorist, any jihadist, any ISIS member. What terrifies me is the confused white man. So, Nicholas. You don't have to tell me anything. But fuck me, if I was you, I'd start talking right now. What happened, Nicholas? Didn't she like you, eh? You couldn't fuck her, is that it? I think I would like to see my lawyer right now. Okay, so we're not gonna discuss this then? Discuss what? I heard something last night. No. Yes, I did. I have a recording. Wait, you recorded me? I was talking to some friends. Without internet? I was leaving them a voice memo for when we get internet again. Let me hear it. No. Give me your phone. No. Why? I really don't like to be recorded. You can barely hear anything. All right then, give it to me. I won't give you my phone because it's nothing, okay? Okay. You better have a look at this. What is this? This is the result from your time in the tank. Turns out, you have HPPD. Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder and it needs to be treated. Wait, what? This is for real, Amelia. What are you talking about? During the time in the tank I got a very high profile of your pre-fortex. I believe that's why you heard things last night. What do you want? No, seriously. What do you want? I want to help you. One more session in the tank and I could go deeper into the different aspects that are causing this paranoia. What if I don't want to? Please. Hi, guys, how are you doing? I had a really bad night again last night. I'm starting to wonder whether I made the right decision by coming here or not. My research isn't going anywhere. I totally failed. I don't know what's going on. I mean, I do want to finish this. But all I can do is talk into this stupid camera. Just a few more days. I'm getting messages coming through. We must be going up. The Internet's back on. Amelia, can you hear me? Claire? Claire, what are all these messages? - What's going on? - Amelia, I need you to stay calm. Calm? What's happening? Who is coming for us? Amelia, the authorities have gathered all information. They have a warrant on Nicholas. Now, they need to find your location. Can you tell us anything? On what charges? We're coming back in a couple of days. Amelia, I don't know how to put this. What? They think that Nicholas is on the run - for a befriended embassy. - But with me on here? He's asking for asylum. It's not possible. I need you to stay calm. He mustn't know that you're up to something. At this point, he's considered armed and dangerous. He's not, here look. I can send you our location. We tried hard to find your current location but we can only find the location from where you departed. Now, I need you to stay calm and I need you to... Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Hey, you okay? I'm fine. Were you looking for me? Yeah, I came to see what happened - to the internet. - I shut it down. We'll start moving again, battery's fully charged. - Shut it down? - Yeah. Okay, I was trying to send something to my friend. Oh, can it wait until tomorrow? Are you okay? You want to sit down? Here, have some tea. It looks like you were just hyperventilating a moment ago. Thank you. Look, how 'bout some dinner tonight? That will be lovely, thank you. Something a bit more fancy than this? Thank you, Nicholas. Attention, dinner almost ready. Well, hello, Ms. Anderson. Please, have a seat. You didn't have to do this. Please, a little bit of luxury every now and then, it's okay, no? Thank you, Nicholas. To your research. To research. So, are you feeling better? Oh yeah, yes. Thanks for checking up on me. Strange, my perception of time has completely changed over the last few days. I tend to get more done. Good. How is your sleep, okay? Yeah. Any nightmares? No, not really. Good. Any unusual heart rhythm or panic attacks? A little bit, yeah. I'm so sorry that I pushed you into these sessions in the tank. But they will help you, you know? When did you start these sessions? I don't recall exactly but my doctor advised them to me after the accident. Cope with the post traumatic stress disorder. Does it work? I think so, yes. You get to know yourself much better when you're in there. Just in combination with the medicine, just tends a bit much. It does, yeah. I hope that you're hungry. One of the very few species that have survived for the last millions of years still so tasty. So you didn't notice anything strange about Amelia while you were onboard? I already told you no. She seemed tired but, I thought she just put a lot of hours into her studies. No signs of panic, paranoia? Nothing that I'm aware of, no. Did you trust her? For the time, yes. But we were just starting to get to know each other. So you found her old school recording device. Oh yeah, we found it. With Amelia's last recording in it. I'm so sorry that I pushed you into these sessions in the tank. But they will help you, you know? And that you were an only child, that's crazy. You must have missed your dad. Not really. I didn't know him so, wasn't something I ever knew anything about, really. What are you doing? Do I what? What, no, come on. Relax, nobody's watching us. So can you tell me what's going on there? Don't you have the footage from the CCTV? Don't play games with me, Nicholas. You know full well that all those cameras were turned off that specific night. You must have missed your dad. Not really. I didn't know him so, wasn't something I ever knew anything about, really. Start music. What are you doing? Do you know how to dance, Amelia? Do I what? Do you know how to dance? - What, no. - Come on. Relax, nobody's watching us. Amelia, I have to tell you something. What was that? Warning, security program activated. What the fuck was that? I don't know. What do you want from me? No! - Amelia. - What? I need you to stay calm. I can't, I've had it with this shit. Door closing. Anyone who is watching this, we are submarine. We have been hit. Please send help. Can I please have a smoke? I told you, I don't remember. The submarine got hit, I fell down, unconscious. That's it. And you don't recall anything that Amelia did while you were out? No. Did she get help from anyone on the outside or the inside? Did she call anyone? Was there anyone else on board? Amelia? Please open the door. Amelia. Amelia! Open the door! Tell me what the fuck is going on. I don't know. We have a leak and I don't know how much time we have. You better unlock the door now. Or I can reprogram it. Door opening. Unresponsive server. Oxygen level 76. What did you do? Amelia, please untie me. Why should I believe you? 'Cause there's no other option. You've got no other choice, do you? How do I know you're not gonna attack me? Amelia. Why did you pick me? What do you mean? Why me? I don't... We're the same. You and me. No, we're not the same. You are very different to me. Why? 'Cause I got more money or fame? It doesn't mean shit, doesn't it? Please unite me, please let us leave, okay. What do you want, die down here, suffocate? Shut up, I'm trying to think. Come on! Thank you. Now get us out of here. It doesn't work. Don't play games, Nicholas. What did you do? I didn't do anything. Fuck. You knew they were coming for us, didn't you? Who were? You planned this whole fucking thing. I have no idea what you're talking about. You knew. What, knew what? Fuck you! No seriously, just. Stop it. Oh fuck. We can go all day and night with this, Nicholas. We've got an audiotape, CCTV, illegal drugs, the gun. Jesus Christ, it's like you're playing never get of jail Bingo. Not to mention all the other allegations. If you won't tell us anything, how about we let a judge take a look at this and let them come to their own conclusions? Why can't we make a deal? We can make a deal when we know what happened. Why don't you just tell us? You saying nothing makes you look more like a perpetrator. If we can make a deal on the stated allegations, I will give you more details. Okay, talk. We got into an argument. Did you hit her? We had to get out of the submarine. The water was rushing in, the oxygen level was less and less. Apparently, she destroyed all the buoyancy levels. Why? How should I know? I was out. So you assaulted her? No! Why would I do that? Well something went wrong. This is the reason why I'm sitting here, isn't it? Who are you? Let go. Unresponsive server. Oxygen level 55. Okay. You need to listen, okay, I have to tell you something. Who is she? What are you talking about? The girl you're hiding here. Where is she? Oh come, seriously. Look, Amelia, I have to confess. I haven't been completely honest with you, all right? What are you talking about? Who is she? - Look, Amelia... - Your daughter? This whole thing isn't real, okay. I know it's real and you have kidnapped somebody's daughter or did she not die in a car accident. Amelia, I wanted to tell you earlier, okay, but I just wanted to get to know you a little more because... You're a fucking maniac. She's just a child. What the fuck are you talking about? Then what is this? Okay, all right. Look, easy now. If you shoot this one we both are gonna die, all right? They were right about you. Look, I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry for everything. I'm sorry. You're a fucking asshole. Shoot me then. Shoot me, okay! Fuck you. The gun isn't real. It's a dummy I picked up on the black market. So why the fake gun in the first place? I just wanted to see how she would react. So you were testing her? Yes. That's pretty fucked up, Nicholas. How do you think that's gonna hold up in court? I wanted to tell her but she wouldn't listen. She just, she just wouldn't listen. I think we'll take a short break, there. Your lawyer should be here any minute. Oxygen level 35. I just wished I had more time. What does it matter now? All this bullshit. Studying. Working hard. Getting people to like you. It seems so stupid to think about it. The fact of knowing would only torment you. Feels kind of ironic now, doesn't it? What do I know? I'm not even gonna get a fucking degree. So what happens now? Bright light followed by eternal darkness? The afterlife? Reunited with loved ones? I never really thought about it. It feels good right now. It feels pretty fucking good right about now. Why would you do this, Nicholas? There's still so much that I want to do, things I want to say to people. Tell them they're very beautiful, tell my mom that I love her, even though we have fights most of the time. Silly fights. She always says that I'm like my dad. Big ego that will never listen. What does it matter now? I'm gonna die as a lonely loser on a stupid boat because I thought I could change the world with this. Silly me. Silly silly. Bye, Nicholas. Goodbye. In the recent incident relating to the T-O Xenia in which it was extensively damaged and the life of my client, Mr. Hallberg, was put in considerable danger. Regarding this, the state has finally admitted full liability and will in consequence will pay compensation and damages to all concerned parties, including my client. All charges against my client, Mr. Hallberg, have forthwith been dropped. Please sign for me, Nick. Yes. Thank you. I think we're all done here. Would you be so kind, Ethan? Oh just curious, Nicholas. Why did you do it? I mean it's obvious you can afford anything you want in the world, so why didn't you try to get away? I mean, you never even left the harbor. Do you really want to know the answer? It's so simple. It's because I can. Can you give me your full name, please, miss? Amelia Olivia Anderson. Amelia, how long do you think you were onboard the submarine? Something like a week? 10 days. Now, we found lots of high tech equipment on board, video cameras, video display units, WiFi signal jammers, that kind of thing. Did you know you were being filmed? No. But you were aware of the CCTV cameras? What? Sorry. I can't. It's okay, it's okay. Amelia, we seem to think that Mr. Hallberg was using you as some sort of guinea pig in some sort of sick simulation experiment. What about the girl? Is she all right? - She all right? - Amelia we... Is she all right? Amelia, we found no one else on board. Just the two of you. ♪ Row row row your boat ♪ ♪ Gently down the stream ♪ ♪ Merrily merrily merrily ♪ ♪ Life is but a dream ♪
