Kyonyu doragon - Onsen zonbi vs sutorippa 5 - BIG TITS DRAGON - HOT SPRING ZOMBIES vs STRIPPER 5 I need water. I have to rinse this blood away now. Water. Water. Damn it. Lena. You're too active to be dead. Just act like corpses. Bring it on. How come? Sorry, wait a second. Just wait. Don't come any closer. Pay me 1,000 yen per zombie. That's way too much. Come on, start up. Yes! Thank you Lord. I know the timing's not right to introduce myself. My name is Lena Jodo. I just happen to be surrounded by zombies. Actually, I'm an entertainer. Thank you, sir. We've only had one customer. We'll wait until the next one comes. Oh, I lost my drive. The customers are too stingy to give tips. Don't complain. You should thank them. Hey Maria, what are you doing? What the heck is that? How dare you! Don't sneak up on me like that. Don't prick me with a needle. For me the stage and anywhere else is where I express myself. All the world's a stage. And all the men and women merely players. Shakespeare. Maybe you're smarter, but don't be arrogant. Cut it out. But Ginko. Lena was wrong. We must preserve our privacy in the greenroom. Any objections? Maria calls herself an underground idol, but I don't like her. Stay away from her. Look at her arm. So many scars from cutting herself. I wouldn't be at such a lousy theatre if I had money. SEVERAL DAYS AGO What? Why am I here? You were drunk, you broke into my cardboard box last night. Did I really? Don't tell me we...? Let's do it again. Come on, girl. I have to go now. No, stay. Don't go. Let me go, you dirty old man. Give me my umbrella, bitch. My life after I came back from Mexico, was wild and full of rock spirits. I mean, I had very little money. The call was from a dubious guy. Hello? Buneos Tardes. Hello. How are you Lena? Manjiro, from Ikagawa Promotions speaking. Remember me? Of course, I do. Where's the money you owe me? I'll pay it in a lump sum with the next one. I need a dancer for 10 days beginning this month. Aiko got arrested, you know. I'm in trouble. Are you listening? I accepted an offer from this notorious guy, because I needed a place to stay. If I had money I'd never end up here, it's like Texas in Japan. PARADISE IKAGAWA THEATRE Excuse me? Excuse me. Sorry, the seat belt is stuck. Are you Ms Lena Jodo? I'm here to pick you up. I'm Yudai. I have no thumb. My thumb's gone. I've been looking for it everywhere. In my dreams. In your dreams? I was sleeping with my thumb like this. It went numb. KEEP OUT Don't tell me this is it. No. It's over there. I'm so relieved. What's this, anyway? The ex-owner tried to build a spa resort here. But he failed and his family all committed suicide. A family suicide? Now the local punks come here to test their courage. Okay, let's go. The theatre is right in front of the devastation. I bet it isn't at all popular? How is it? The tower is the worst card. It shows bad luck. Right, the audience looks like the living dead. What about my fortune? Lucky in love? Your love life is... What? Just forget it. No, I can't. Tell me. You'll be popular with lots of handsome men. You mean it? Three customers are here. Please get ready. That's mine. Next is sexy Nene's barnyard show. Let's hear it for Nene. Ginko, do you have a light? A cigarette, too? Maybe you're bored stiff. This is better than being in jail. Jail? She's from Southeast Asia. Don't cry. You make me sad, too. What's wrong? Do you have a bellyache? Don't cry. You make me sad, too. I have no coins. - Give her small change. The monk kept holding the dead boy like he was alive. Then the boy's body started to rot. A terrible, foul smell permeated everything. But the monk wouldn't let the boy go. Finally, he began eating the boy's stinking corpse. How scary! Excuse me. I got a phone call from the boss. The theatre is closing tomorrow. Closing? You mean he won't pay us for tomorrow? Come on, boy. Tell me what's going on, Yudai. I know nothing. For a start, do we get paid for this gig? Well, no customers, no pay, right? He took a year to make the last payment. That's terrible. I have a family to feed. We must talk to the boss. IKAGAWA EVENT PROMOTIONS Did you really bury the three of them? You're slow to get work done. We'll have to seal the well with concrete or something. Is the boss in? Someone's here. Talk to you later. Boss! Oh you're here. Hey, lovely ladies. Welcome to my office. Enough jokes. We need an explanation. This was a big sightseeing spot in the 1960's. But now we're in a recession. People have fewer children, they don't go away. I don't want to hear your bullshit. Just promise to pay us. Of course, I'll pay what I owe. So, stop doing this. I'm only doing it because the tourism board asked me to. You know the ex-owner killed himself. That's not our concern. Closing the theatre means you won't pay us, right? Others work at the local spa when they're off duty. What? Shall I introduce you? It pays good money. You can do the strip show. You'll get big tips for stripping. Great. I love money. IKAGAWA SPA RESORT Hello. Ikagawa Promotions sent us here. Hello. Is anyone there? Hi there. We're dancers sent by Ikagawa Promotions. Think where you are. Those in the sex trade come in the back door. Sex trade? Look, I want to confirm one thing. We're dancers, okay? We're not hostesses, nor prostitutes, understand? Of course, I know that. Now warm up the party. Stop that crap. Let's start sumo wrestling. What? I have plenty of money. You're great, Boss. So generous! Mr President, I love money very much. The winner will get money. The loser will endure a penalty game. Are you ready? Get set! Begin! Hang in there! Go for it! Come on, take it easy. No, I can't do that. Miss Lena won. Ginko will undergo a penalty game. Ginko, you look beautiful. So delicious. How dare you. Great! Is this Dom Perignon? This is Red Sake, from Kyoto. Far more expensive than Dom Perignon. From where do I start eating? You touched my nipple on purpose, didn't you? Shall I pour sake on your right spot? That stings! No, it stings. Shall I put grated wasabi there? No, stop doing that. Give me sake. You're a strong drinker. Yes, I am. Hey, will you sleep with me tonight? No way! That's totally out of the question. How dare you! It's totally impossible to sleep with a creep like you. What? Did I actually sleep with him? Hey girl, you were the best. I have to go now. No, don't take that. Shall we do it again? Come to Ikagawa, the secret porno spa resort. I've watched this cheap TV CM more than 300 times. It's really freezing here. You're right. Will you challenge me again? Be ready for it! Mum and Dad, please help me. Okay, one, one, five! Great! Damn it! Lord, let me win. I did it! Two, three, four! Just wait. Look! You used a rigged dice. Oh, no. You can get away with being cock-happy. But you can't get away with cheating. How dare you say that! We're dancers not prostitutes, okay? Stop annoying me. You're too old fashioned. I'm just easy to fall in love, that's all. That's a typical slut. Stop preaching, you jail yard punk. My bra is custom-made, you know. Any nutrition goes to your tits not your brain. You, too! How dare you! That's enough! Get naked on stage, not here. It's jerry-built. Try not to break it. The cold wind is blowing in. What are you doing? What's that? The wind's blowing in from here. It's locked. The key? I know. I didn't know what this key was for. Come on... It's freezing! Shall we go in? We're expecting customers any moment. I bet none will come until nighttime. Come on, let's go. Don't start. Maybe there's an old cellar. I bet it's just for storage. The staircase goes on forever. So cold. Watch out for dog shit. Maybe it... What? Leads to the ruined building across the street. You mean it? The door's open. Wow, look at this. What the hell is this? The ex-owner's belongings? The one who killed himself? It's 'the Well of Spirits'. The Well of Spirits? Look, it's written here. Look, it's a false one. This is fantastic. What are you doing? Let's grab something expensive. You mean you'll steal? We're all working for free in this hick town, right? We can't return empty-handed, can we? What's up? Nothing. Terrific! That's a first edition Bataille. There are so many rare books here. There's even one by Aleister Crowley. This is great. What's great? It's a fabulous library of occult books. He must have been a dedicated collector. Maybe all those debts made him crazy. This looks like the Book of the Dead, from l6th century Italy. Can we sell it? Don't touch it. - Why not? You're too dumb to appreciate it. Can you read Latin? Bitch! Stop fighting. This is about the Law of the Universe. The borderline between this world and the afterlife. For example, I can revive the dead. What? Go on, then. Okay, I will. What? Who's revived? It's crap! It's just a waste of time. It's freezing in here. Right. I'm all dirty. I need a shower. Let's go back. Fools! PARADISE I can't believe it's a 15 minute drive to the nearest supermarket. No need to cook fancy. Anything will do. But it's better to be cheap and delicious. I'm impressed. What's up? Look at that! The dried fish is alive. It can't be. It must be dead. The Sushi, too. It's moving. Sushi zombies! Oh, well. We have no audience. I miss my favorite host at the club in Tokyo. Hey, do you want to drink? It'll warm you up. No, thanks. Sure? Bingo! My money! No, stop it! My poor brothers and sisters. I need money for them. Something terrible is happening! What happened? Look, the rice on your face. Your dinner is in trouble. Here come the audience! We'll have to get ready. Where's Darna? Maybe she ran away. Foreign dancers usually do. That's too bad. Let's do it without her tonight. PARADISE THEATRE STRIP SHOW A big audience. Such a big audience tonight. The music is our cue. Hello, everyone! The guy second from the right is so cool. What are you saying? He has that death-metal look. We gotta run! No! Don't touch me. You are... Nene! Move! Beat it! Grab her quickly. The attacks began 2 hours ago. And have spread all over the nation. Here in Tokyo, a vast mob emerged from Aoyama Cemetery to attack people at random What's that? The real thing? Must be a cheap movie. They're big recently. Like some girl fighting zombies with a sword. Enough of your babble! Come and help me stop them. There's no point. What? I can't use the internet anymore. There's nowhere to escape to. What do you mean? They're the living dead, the zombies. This uprising has spread all over the world. The dead are all alive? Have you finally gone insane? No, maybe she's right. Looks like they're from Hell. What's wrong with you, Nene? Are you okay? This is terrible. It's too late now. How dare you! If you get bitten by them, you turn into one. Didn't you see the movie? Stop taking nonsense. The Night of the Living Dead, a great movie. It has a political message, about Vietnam How dare you! You squished my canker sore. Nene has been good to you. We must come up with an idea to escape. How about this? The key is... Hey, wait! Where are you going? She locked the door. Open the door. I don't think it'll take long. On neither the sun, nor death, can a man look fixedly. La Rochefoucauld. I can't stop them by myself anymore. The car is outside. You got the key? Yes. Will you be able to carry Nene? What do you mean? You grab her while I distract the zombies. You mean it? Nene! Come on, follow me. I'm being chased by lots of men. Her fortune-telling was right. Go away! Lena, are you okay? Many zombies are coming. Run! Now start the car. Do it quickly, come on! I'm trying! Don't swear. Damn zombies! Don't get the car dirty. Wash the car, you bastards! Start up now! I stepped in dog shit. Damn it! Ouch, I hit my tailbone. What an ultimate wrist slitting! Eroticism is assenting life up to the point of death. An extreme state of life, closing in on death. Georges Bataille. Oh no, I'm so scared! Look, I'll give you some candy. I knew it wouldn't work. Don't kill me, I'll flash my tits. Oh, they've stopped attacking me. Want to see my tits? Oh, this one? Attention! Rest! Comaneci! Clap hands! Awesome! Who's he? Some local resident. Is he human or a zombie? Hard to tell. He's always been half-dead. Let's kill him just to be sure. Damn. What a bomb! Hey look. Mount Fuji is emitting smoke. It's a dormant volcano, isn't it? What the hell are they, anyway? They don't die even when they get run over. I think I knew one of them. What? Do you remember that guy with one eye? Yes, sure. I knew him. Really? If it hadn't rained that night I would have stayed home. But I took an umbrella to my father's office. Meanwhile, my sister was... My sister was murdered by him. They found him not guilty because he was insane. That's why you were in jail. I'm positive he was dead. He died someplace totally different. What's going on? No idea. Nene needs treatment as soon as possible. She has a fever. What'll we do? Maybe I can get some medicine from the inn. Sure. Okay, let's go. What? What's that? You can be rude today. Let's have a party. Delicious looking shellfish. I'll eat it. Thank you, Lena. You're welcome. Are you okay? I'll get some medicine now. I was planning to retire this year. I planned to open a noodle shop in Tokyo. I even paid the deposit. Damn it! Don't say such that. It sounds like you're dying. Maria was right. If one of them bites you, you turn into a zombie. So I'll soon be a zombie. Don't say that. Hang in there. I can see the gates of Hell. What an inferno! It's okay. A good night's sleep will fix you up. Could you do me a favor? What? I want you to kill me. Don't be silly. I like you guys, I really do. We like you, too. Because I like you so much I can't stop myself from eating you. Do you remember the story I told you the other day? About the monk who ate the little boy. Come on, Nene. I want you to kill me right away. Or I can't stop myself from eating you. I want to eat you! Damn hot! It's burning. Where is it coming from? What are you trying to say? Seal 'the Well of Spirits'. The Well of Spirits? All I could get you were plastic flowers. Please forgive me. What's "the Well of Spirits" anyway? That old basement where Maria tried to revive the dead. I think that's the key. You mean if we destroy it, things will settle down? Each raindrop gathers to become a waterfall. And then a river which forms a sea. The sea gathers winds and clouds and that's why it rains. Why so suddenly? That's just how the world works. They shouldn't even exist. We have two bullets. If one of us becomes a zombie, kill the other one. Sure. What are they? That's Maria. I was expecting you guys. What do you mean? To begin with, you were jealous of my talent and beauty. You've always been hard on me. What? Jealous of you? Were we? Perpetrators are always very callous. That's the underlying structure of bullying. But those days are gone. Now I have an eternal treasure. Eternal treasure? Yes, one which shines brighter than any jewel. Far more eternal than a diamond. Death is the answer to everything. That's Darna. Isn't she pretty? I'll create a kingdom of zombies on earth. And I'll live well as the Queen of Death. You're totally insane. Death visits everyone equally. Naturally, you're no exception. Kill them. Ginko, grab her book! Hey, wait! This is bad. It's ruining my nail polish. Sachiko. Big sister? My little sister. Sachiko Darna? I'm so pitiful. I want to see my little brothers and sisters. Darna, wait! Let me go! Let me go! Japanese are all liars. Let me go! What's this? Now I have Wasabi paste! Take that! Wasabi is so hot! I need water. I must rinse this blood away now. Water. Damn it! You're too active to be dead. Just behave like corpses. Bring it on. How come? Sorry, wait a second. Just wait. Don't come any closer. Pay me 1,000 yen per zombie. That's way too much. Come on, start up! Yes! Thank you Lord. You perverted zombie! I'll keep killing you. We're almost at the well. Are you okay? Maybe I can't make it. Neither of us will die here. Hang in there. Ginko, are you okay? It can't be helped. Maria. She'll soon turn into a zombie. How come? Were you bitten? Sorry I didn't tell you. Shoot me now. I can't. She's lost all hope. Once she turns into a zombie, she'll lose her will. All the dead will become my faithful servants. Damn. You're the lowest scum. Now Ginko, shoot Lena Jodo, kill her. Shoot my breast. Aim here. Yes, shoot her! You idiot! I've always hated you. Now I'll step on your face. With a shoe full of dog shit. Oh, that hurt! Now I have even more scars. How come? That's impossible. I'll push you into Hell. Relive the Devil! What's going on? Excuse me, am I back on earth? Who are you? Blue Ogre I'm a department manager down in Hell. I'm the Blue Ogre. Sorry that our dead have caused you so much trouble. I hear the prisons up here are all full too. Just like Hell. They always escape when something comes up. But we'll all get this fixed today. I see. I'll take them right away. I'll take you to the Devil. What? I'm no zombie. I'm not dead yet. The goal of all life is death. Sigmund Freud. He's unexpectedly literate. You'll be okay. I'll get you to a hospital. I don't think I can make it. Let's head back to Tokyo. I'll introduce you to Ken at the Host Club. Who's Ken? He's a host. He's so cool. Oh, rot! Love is wonderful. I'm damn sure that is not love. SEVERAL DAYS LATER Ginko, Nene and Darna died. But I wasn't sad. The best thing for them is not to grieve, but to thank them. IKAGAWA EVENT PROMOTIONS Hi, Boss. Jodo is here. Where are you? Hi, Lena. So you're alive? I was so worried about you. So you are here. I want you to pay all my salary in a lump sum. You know that things have been very hectic. All the banks were closed, so I have no cash. Sorry about that. I'll pay. Why didn't you do that first? And I want you to pay for the other girls. Why? They're all dead. That's no excuse. That's not right. You know they have no human rights.
