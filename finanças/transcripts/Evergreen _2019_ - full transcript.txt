How come every term for significant other is like a food? That's a good point. - It's a good point, right? - Honey, sugar... well not like darling. So, when are your parents driving up? Not until Christmas morning. Is your mom so excited to see me? She is beyond excited. No, she really, she really loves you. She loves you, like, she loves you more than me. I really believe that. Right, oh, right there. Ready for the best Christmas of your life? Here's the wind-up and the pitch. Oh, gross! Hey. You got slobber all over me. This is genuine wool from Italy, baby. Why haven't we come here before? This, this place is crazy. Yeah, I don't know. We used to come here a lot more. I guess I was just waiting for the perfect moment. One, two, three! - Oh, oh! - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry! - I'm going! - Move it, move it, move it. Oh, oh! It's so cold. Oh. What did you do? Oh, thank you. Go. Look at the presents under the tree! Oh, these stockings, so cute. How many dead animals are in this house, Paul? Seriously. Did you kill any of these animals, you wild man? Love you. I never kissed inside a bear before. It was kind of fun. I'm gonna go grab the bags, Paulie. ♪ Don t go away for good ♪ ♪ it s such a long drive ♪ Darling... ♪ I don t think I d survive ♪ - Darling, bye ♪ I can t picture this house ♪ - Oh, dear God. please let tonight be the night. ♪ I can t picture this house ♪ ♪ without you here ♪ Knock knock. You said to dress up, darling. Wow. Turkey or cock? 101 or 81? Come, come, Paulie. Ah. You have much to learn. So, what do you want? Cock. It's the year of the rooster. We cannot deny the calendar. What do you taste? Shoe polish. Brilliant, Paulie. For an esteemed brand ambassador, you don't have the champagne taste. We Kentuckians appreciate the simpler things in life. Now, don't be a chicken, Paulie. Down the hatch, there you go. Cock-a-doodle-doo! Oh, God, just when I start to think you're cute, you go and do that. Can you ask me a question? Okay. I want you to ask me when I knew you were the one. When did you know that I was the one? It was last Christmas, when I was stuck in bed with the flu. So, like, just a few months after we started dating? Yeah, I guess it was. You know, that was my first Christmas I'd ever spent away from my family, and I thought I'd be homesick, but you were there. You stayed and took care of me. I love you. Gena, I want to give you everything this weekend. You are just the corniest. Oh, I'm warming up. There's a lot of layers here. Oh, let's do something to keep warm. What's wrong? Hold on. We shouldn't do it like this. I am-we're really- I'm really drunk. Maybe we should call it a night before we do something we'll regret. Paul, no, can we- it's fine, can we just, can we, can we talk about it? Can we just talk about it? I don't think that is what we'll do. And would that be so bad? Gena? Trust me. Okay? Okay. I'm sorry. Can we talk about this in the morning? I took it too far. I didn't mean to- I- I just need to lay down. You okay? Catholics are so fixated on the discharge of bodily fluids. It's a wonder that they'll even let themselves sneeze. Hmm. So, why are we trying to sell him something that he doesn't want to buy? He'll get there. He's just not ready. Do you think he's asking more of you than you are of him? No. No, not- I'm not running this script again. Gena. You succulent papaya. Oh my God, you're the worst. You're strong, successful, 30. Hmm. You could have any man you want. Do you think that maybe you're just checking off a box because you hear the clock ticking? No. No. No, I don't want just anyone. I want, I want a good one. Not like me. Not like you. Like Paul. Paul is a good one. Not you. Did you want more coffee? Mm-hmm. Look. What? I'm sorry last night was awkward. I was unfair to you. I know I keep falling into this. I really am sorry. I don't mean to be jerking you around. But, you do jerk me around, Paul. You can see where that might be a little confusing for me, yeah? I can. That's on me. I know it can seem selfish for me to not give myself to you. But it's not because I don't want to. I really do. I just don't want to take from you- We've had this conversation before, Paul. And I don't get it. I don't. I just, I want to give this to you, and I don't understand why you think you'd be taking something that I'm willingly giving to you, I just-I just- Gena, I think sex is more than just sharing yourself with someone. I- it's someone giving themselves completely to the other person, and when the other person does it back- I hear you, but I can't have this body language talk again. You do know that these go in the trash, right? It's okay if you didn't. Can they go down the sink? They're gonna have to. Can you not leave the water running, Paul, please? Look. I just don't always know what it is that you want, or when you want it, or when it's okay, you know? I- first base, second base, third base, third and a half base. Just because I don't live up to my ideals doesn't mean they're wrong. It means I'm wrong. You have to understand how incredibly convenient that is for you. No, no, you get caught up in, in these moments, and you let me do these things to you, and vice versa, to be fair, but then you get away with it. Because you turn around and you say, oh, I feel guilty, and we shouldn't have done that, and that wasn't that bad, and I'm sorry. You get off, and then wash your hands, and get to feel righteous. And then, and then I'm left feeling like I forced myself on you. And that's not okay! That makes me feel like shit! You just can't pick and choose the moments when, when you believe, Paul. I know. I'm a hypocrite. But I've messed it up before not waiting, so I want to wait just a little bit longer. Is that okay? Dropped one. You just said this was gonna be a special weekend, Paul. I mean, look where we are. Yeah, I can understand that. You know I'm not a good word person. My mouth is way faster than my mind sometimes. Are we okay? I have a proposition. We're here for the weekend, right? And sex is definitely off the table. So, let's do this. Cut the pillow talk, get down to brass tacks. Just dig deep, ask any questions, the other has to answer completely honestly, no second-guessing, no hesitation, no judgment, just-just us. Just the parts you can't touch. Nothing physical? Nothing physical. Alright, I accept. Excellent. So, what made you start smoking? Since when do you have a problem with me smoking? I never said I have a problem with you smoking. I said, when did you start smoking? I don't know. The point of the game is to answer questions, Gena. I know, Paul. It just wasn't a seminal moment. I remember my first cigarette. Was it yesterday? I was 12. Cassie snuck some from her brother, and we, and we'd smoke them before riding bikes, and- You and Cassie grew up together? Yeah, I've told you that. Okay. But you're up, not me. All right, you want to know? Mm-hmm. First time I smoked was at church, actually, believe it or not. Because that's what you do, right? Our church youth group would hold these nights to showcase local bands, and I had a crush on the lead singer of one of the bands, as you do. I think they were called, oh, God, like Trinity Forever, like one of those really shitty- Trinity Forever, man. - Christian rock bands, yeah. Oh, and the lead singer used to smoke behind the church. And finally, one Saturday, I walked up to him and I said, can I have a cigarette? Just to have something to say to him. Mmm. I was so clueless I put the wrong end in my mouth. And he had to get really close to me, and he turned it around. And then he lit it for me. And it was so romantic. And I took two drags, and I puked on his Vans. All over them. Aw. And then you lived happily ever after? Yeah, yeah. Aw, I'm sorry. Hey, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. You agreed. No touching. Oh, right. - Yeah, nothing at all. - Nothing at all. Can't even step into the batter's box. - No. - Don't do that to me. No. Alright, fine. Pleasure doing business, Gena. Mm-hmm. Oh my God, our house looks like your suit. You're so cute. - You're so cute and festive. - I planned it. So, I have a question for you. Mm-hmm. Why didn't you go back to baseball, after everything? Thought about it. It was just kind of one of those things where a few months go by, and you don't train, and you realize it's too late. But then a few more months go by, and you realize, no, it wasn't too late, Paul, but now it's definitely too late. And then a year goes by, and you're like- Shoot. I don't think I can throw a baseball anymore. And I just kind of realized that what I really wanted out of life was to be a husband, be a father, raise a family. You never resent it? Having to give it up? It wasn't her choice. It was my choice. That still doesn't answer my question. I love that you love the church, but my experience was very different. My experience was getting hit on by Father Dino and his Knights of Columbus every Octoberfest like they'd never seen tits before, and only for them to tell me Sunday through Thursday how to act, and what to dress like, and when to screw with who. I mean, it's ridiculous. I'm sorry that was your experience. But just because they love a good thing badly doesn't mean that they don't love a good thing. Look, I just don't want to flounder dead-eyed in pews every Sunday like my dad did. I mean, my sister and I sat there week after week, and we sat in that distance between our parents, and it was, it was palpable, and I don't- no touching, what are you doing? Yeah, I just made the bed. Oh, thank you. Just don't want there to be a distance between us, you know? I don't think I can pass on a faith that I don't have. I'm not asking you to sell doughnuts after mass. I'm asking you to love me. Because that's what our kids will see. They'll see a mother who loves them, and that's what they'll remember. My mom didn't become Catholic till I was in high school. Ugh, God, you get so close to convincing me that it'll work, and then you say something like that, and just that little glimmer of hope that I'm just gonna magically become Catholic again like your mom did. It just- it's not gonna happen for me. That's not my story. I'm glad it worked for your mother, glad it worked for your family. But that's not gonna be me. I just need you to support me. I do. I do. Great. Then that's enough. We just start? Okay. ♪ Is there something ♪ ♪ something out of place here ♪ ♪ something I can t face here ♪ ♪ something I don't know ♪ ♪ Is there someone ♪ ♪ someone on your mind now ♪ ♪ someone I don't mind now ♪ ♪ someone I don't know ♪ ♪ Doo da, doo da ♪ Yes. ♪ Is there somewhere ♪ ♪ somewhere we could go now ♪ You should go back. Hey, Paulie? Paulie, I'm ready. Where are ya? Hello? Oh. It's a beautiful rock. That's your cut, too. Alright. Alright, I guess I like him. Only because you do. Shit. Hey! Hello. Looking for this? Oh, yeah. Yes, actually. You little forgetful darling. How do you like that? - Okay, thank you. - You're welcome. When are you gonna show me the rest of this ranch of yours? What would you like to see? Um... the most magical place here. All this nature, and your mother got us a fake tree. She knew I wouldn't water a real one. Oh, Paulie. Idea. Well, at least she's real. - What's that, boy? - Huh? He says he wants to give you a ride. But I still want to treat you to skiing. Forgive me. - Appreciate you. - Here we are. - We will build a snowman. - We will build. Yes, we will. Who's Copper? Copper was my cat. He was such a cool cat till I was allergic to him. My dad gave him away without me knowing. That's so sad. Did you bag this one yourself? I bagged this one myself. A real elk in there, and you decided to make it bronze? Nope, there it is. So, that's the secret. Don't look down, and then fall? - Don't look down. - Don't look down and don't fall. Don't look down. Your metaphors are confusing. Aww, cute. Oh my gosh. Isn't Santa tacky enough without putting him on a picnic basket? Let's make a fish, let's put a dog next to him. Bop bop bop. I'm not creepy enough as it is. Mmm, I hate him. Now step forward, close your eyes. Now you hit a jump, you're in the air. You can move each limb freely. Yeah, all right. Paul, is there a real elk in here? My aunt does bronze taxidermy. No, gross! This is the spot where my dad proposed to my mom. Well, how'd he do it? What's the story? Well, first, he got down on one knee. Yeah? And then he proposed. It's not that great of a story. I don't know. Oh my God. Somehow, some way, you land perfectly. Open. It's you. It's me. You're breaking the rules. This is the most magical place? There's shuffleboard! Uh ping it, ping it first. - Don't tell me how to play. - Ping it. Come on. You ping it. Alright. While you miss this, I'll go ahead and ask you a real serious question. Mm-hmm. What's your favorite cereal? Oh my gosh. Easy, Corn Pops. - P. - P. P-I- Ah. You know all about the flavor delay? It's like, you have to really think about that in cereal. So, Life, Honeycombs and Frosted Flakes, it's like two different culinary experiences. You've got one before the milk, and- One after the milk. So, Frosted Mini Wheats. Thoughts. Stop shaking the table. P-I-N-G. I thought we just- - We have to get past G. - Ready? Waiting. Alright. How in the world did you two get an annulment to begin with? I mean, we applied, like you do with annulment. That's not what I meant by how. You two grew up very close, very religious, right? Mm-hmm. I mean, an annulment means there was not a marriage to begin with. The conditions for that are very strict. I don't understand the question. So, you don't believe in soulmates? Oh, I hate that word. It just depends on how you define it. Okay. Agreed, agreed. I don't mean someone like you're made for, I have this theory. Say you had every man in the world lined up in front of you. I like it. You'd have, like, a compatibility percentage with each person, right? So, you have Balthazar over here from the Midwest. Balthazar. Like a stay at home dad without any kids, really boring. - 17.8%. - Got it. You have Ethan over here, macho, bit of a party animal, wild card. 74.6%. Then you have Paul over here. Paul Owen. - Suave, charming, handsome. - Debonair. Debonair. 99.8%. True. I just think that every note has its pitch. Every thrift store has its "Jerry Maguire" VHS. Every person has its person. Like, you can't, you just, you have to mean the vows, the death do us part, the children. You can't just do it because you want to get laid, or because you feel obligated. Or because I got my friend pregnant. I don't know, I think just this idea of, you know, one person having this, like, missing piece of you, it's just, it's just dangerous, you know? You spend so much time looking for that person and trying out new things, it's like, we spread ourselves so thin looking for that one person that, you know, if we saved a little bit for the person we actually chose, then that person could, in theory, become our soulmate, or whatever you want to call it. I guess my real question is just that, if you guys were so close to begin with, why did you leave? How did it not work out? She was miserable, and I felt like she gave up. Felt like... felt like I, I was hurting her. And whatever problems we had before were way worse after. You know, why punish ourselves for the sake of something that wasn't there? I tried. I really tried. But... you know... losing a baby's hard. So, if I may ask? Sure. If you can essentially make it work with anyone, why did you not make it work with Dylan? Did you not love him? Of course, I loved him. But it takes two people to constantly be adjusting to each other, and I didn't get that from him. It wasn't a two-way street with us. And also, just the timing of it was wrong. Timing plays a big part in these kind of things. - I don t know. - Okay. I mean, I've told you the things that matter. I mean, I don't want to- Yeah, okay. What are you, what are you trying to say, Paul? What? Say it. Whatever, you have a thing to say, then say it. Now's the time to ask. I feel like I'm being honest with you, so ask me what you want to ask me. Alright, yeah. If now's the time, I, I... I'm just a little nervous that one day you might give up on us if things get- it's just an honest- Really? - It's an honest fear. - Paul. I don't understand. If that is such a doubt you have in your mind, why did you bring me here? Why did you buy a ring? Why did you, you know- A ring? What, what do you mean, a ring? I, I was looking for you in your room, and I, I saw your dresser was open. And I just, I saw it, I saw it. I was like, I-that's not even what this is about. This is about you not believing that I'm gonna pull my weight in this relationship, and that fucking- It's not about that. Ugh! Oh, nice book. Just trying to figure you out, bud. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I keep saying sorry. I, I know I've been distant. A little bit. And weird. A lot bit. I just, I want everything to be perfect. And those were some hard questions earlier. I know. But these are, these are just excuses, okay? I have no right to treat you that way. Anything else? I love you. Want to reset the clock? Yeah. You, uh... you bring any weed? ♪ Don t you wanna take a ride on my jet ski ♪ What do you love most about me? ♪Hey♪ You really care. And you want to make people happy. - Oh! - Oh, shit! What do you hate most about me? Hmm. Oh, there's a surprise in this one. - Eat it. - No! Ugh! You never say sorry. Name this animal. Donkey Doo. Name this animal. Moo, Moosif. Moosif. It's like a little Christmas song over here. Yeah. Paul-loves-fall. It's my favorite season. I know. I'm tired. Let's just sleep by the fire. Would you rather, lights on or lights off? On. How do you know if you don't know? Oh, I know. Would you rather never see me, or never touch me again? Hm, goodness. Is that a threat? Just a question. Just a question? My goodness. Well... I can't see you at all right now. So cold. There you are. I see you. It's pretty good. Hmm, now. See, I think I want more than the eyes can get. Ah, that's against your rules. I can change the rules. There's never enough of anyone. So, which is it? Well, as pretty as you are, I want to hold you, and be able to love you. I couldn't go without seeing you. Are all these really just for decoration? No. So, who are they for? Anyone who'll listen. Does anyone? How long can you wait for a good man to come around? You'd have been a great mother. I'll always be a mother, Paul. I thought it was the right thing. I know. I felt like a curse. I know. I couldn't have made you better. I know. Yeah, I wanted you to be with someone you dreamed of the same way they dreamed of you. Not someone you had to love. What if it was you, Paul, that I dreamed of? You never said anything. You never said anything. I know. Because what if I was too scared? What if I was too sad? What if I didn't want you to feel trapped? What if I didn't want to have to ask you to stay? Hey. I got scared. Oh. You okay? Yeah. Looking for some hand warmers or something. Oh, it's so cold. Come snuggle. - What's up, Scrooge? - Twas the night before Christmas. Hey. Huh? When you fly in your dreams, how do you do it? Huh? When you fly. Do you have to flap your arms really hard, or do you just kind of float, or do you soar like Superman? I guess I usually have to flap pretty hard. You? Superman. - Mm-hmm. - Hmm. What does it mean? I have a theory that how you fly in your dreams is directly related to your personality in real life. Mmm, so flappers, floaters, and Supermen? You got it. So, flappers are persistent, focused, visionary, disciplined? An iron jawline, a real take-charge type? That's Superman, obviously. Hello. Hmm. Well, your test is bunk, because I'm a real take-charge type. No, you're not. Yes, I am. No, you're not. Yes, I am. No, you're not. Am too. I mean, yeah, sure, if nobody else steps up, then absolutely, Paul Owen is the man. But otherwise, I think you're perfectly content to lay back and let somebody else take charge, yeah? Hm, I'm a leader. You're right. I am. I know, you're right. I misspoke. I'm a leader. I'm agreeing with you. No, you're not. So, what are flappers? Uh- self-doubting, indecisive, delusional? No. That's not what I meant. Was Dylan a Superman? Jesus, Paul. No, I was just bullshitting. It's not a real theory. Newsflash. Come on. No, yeah. Come on, give up. Just give up. No, come on and lay down. Give up because you're a little flapper. Oh my God, it's not a real theory, dude. I was just bullshitting. - No, you weren't. You do this. - Yes, I was. You start with a seemingly insignificant idea, and then you peel it back and back until you finally get what you're trying to say. What are you trying to say? - Are you jealous? - Should I be? No. I'm with you. Alright, so, if he had wanted to, you would've married him? Paul, I don't- I don't ask myself questions that can't be answered. Ever the diplomat. I- - Gena, this was your game. - What is your problem? - I've been completely straight with you. - I know it was my game. - I don't know why you can't be straight with me. - I know, I appreciate that. Because I don't know what you're asking me. Why did you end things with Dylan? You know why. I have told you everything that matters. This is so like you. - This is so like you. - Come on, Paulie, just- No, don't call me Paulie, please? It's fucking condescending. Since when do you have a problem with me calling you Paulie? Since always. I'm not your little kid. Well, I didn't know that. You've never told me that before. - I'm not your kid. - I know you're not my kid. - I don't treat you like a kid. - Yeah, you do, though. You do. You dismiss anything that's not a part of your agenda. You throw away, anything about me, my beliefs, my preferences. Oh my God. No, I leave a dish in the sink. - That's the problem. - It's not about the dishes, - Gena, it's about respect. - That is the problem. I'm sorry it'll be, that's earth shattering. Oh, it's about respect, of course, I forgot. Dr. Paul Owen will be giving his lecture series on respect. Everyone gather around, it's a good one. I've heard it before. See? Don't slow clap me. What, you want to be a Superman? Be a Superman. It's not that hard, Paul. Just got to stop hiding from conflict like some scared little kid. Just say what you mean for once. - There's an idea. - Say what I mean? - Say what you mean. - I can't read your mind. You can't handle criticism. That's bullshit. Alright, I have to walk on eggshells, otherwise you transmogrify into this raging banshee. Transmogrify? God, get off it. Gena, I give you, I give you your space. I put up with so much. Oh, you do? You put up with so much? I put up with so much. Oh, poor Paulie. Oh, God, oh sorry, Paul, excuse me. Oh my gosh, there you go, condescending me again. - Just answer the question, please. - I'm not condescending you. Just answer the question, please. What is the question? Why did you end things with Dylan? Because he was married! Fuck. Are you serious? Yeah. You didn't think, hey, future husband, I'm a home wrecker is relevant information? Oh, that is so unfair. That's why I didn't tell you, right there, is because I knew that you would sit there and judge me from this bullshit cookie cutter morality world that only the Owen family lives in. What else are you lying about? I'm not lying! It was complicated, and it was a mistake, but it was a long time ago and I've moved on. - So, can we move on, please? - What else are you hiding? - Any other complications, because- I'm not hiding anything, Paulie. Paul, fuck. You don't seem to have an issue with infidelity. Thank you. That is so unfair! What? I can take it. Tell me. Tell me, Paul. I don't think there's anything to say. Tell me that I disappoint you every day because I'm not the Virgin Mary. Well, guess what? That didn't work out so well for you the last time, did it? Fuck! I didn't mean that, Paulie. Paul. Fuck! Hey. Merry Christmas Eve. What's this? Just read. The day after we met. It's still what I want. I still want to fight for this. Even if it's hard sometimes. Have you ever just wanted to stay in bed all day? Pretty much every day. Well, what if we just did that today? And do what? Nothing. Just laid together. Just rested. That sounds great. Hi. Hi. It's so quiet. - So quiet. - So quiet. I should've told you about Dylan sooner. And not in that moment, and I shouldn't have said the other things that I said. I just never felt like words were really on my side. Kind of like you, you know? Mm-hmm. When I was 16, I loved a boy in a band who smoked cigarettes behind the church. Whose Vans I puked on. But he still made me feel like everything, so I gave him everything. And then he dumped me the night before prom and he told everyone I was easy. Words are big in a small town. They, they travel fast, and they carry a lot of weight, even among those who should know you better than what they've heard. They get you kicked out of drama club, co-op, and 4H, and they even get you asked to stop serving mass because you're too distracting. Too distracting? And your friends and their parents and priests look at you differently. They all looked at me and they didn't see me anymore, Paul, they saw, they saw a scandal, and I said, if that's what I am, then that's what I'll be. They were supposed- they were supposed to be better, Paulie. They were supposed to see me. They were supposed to be allured, or whatever. but it felt like they hated me, and it felt like the Lord hated me, and I started to hate Him, them, all of it. And He never came for me. I didn't, I didn't mean to lie to you. I didn't. I wanted to tell you. I just didn't want you to look at me the way they looked at me. I didn't want to disappoint you. I didn't want to not be enough for you. You're enough. You're so enough. You are more than enough. You hear me? Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. Paul. Hey, hey. Is this really what you want? Hey. Do you really think he can give you what you want? What, like you did? But you loved us. You loved me. I did. I loved you. Just talking, just laughing. Just listening, just us. You've been leaving Katherine since the day I met you, Dylan. You knew I was never going to. I hoped. And-and what if I did? God, I didn't want my daughter to have two homes and not know why mommy and daddy aren't in love anymore. I had to do what I had to do. And you didn't want children back then, and I couldn't afford a divorce and another marriage, and I loved you. Mm-hmm. That was enough for me. It wasn't for me. So, what would you want? A contract, jury of our peers? No, I didn't want you there with her and me waiting in the wings for you. I wanted it to be us, Dylan, and you couldn't give me that. Gena, you were my love, and she was just my wife. But no- it's fantasy to believe that sometimes they can come packaged in the same person. Is it? Oh, come on, let me make you a real drink. Vodka cranberry is a real drink. No, it's not. I'm Gena. And whatever else you're going through, I just-I just want you to know I'm here for you, Paulie. I know it's only been a few months, but I just wanted to say I love you. I feel weird. I just said that over your voicemail, and you can't say it back, and you don't have to. That's not what I- wow, okay, I'm just gonna hang up, so, call me later. I thought you were going back home for Christmas. Well, you need somebody to take care of you. I mean, look at you. Do I really look as bad as I feel? Yes, but you're cute when you're helpless. You know, I've never spent Christmas away from my family before. Well, we'll have our own little family Christmas right here. Look, I brought a gingerbread house, and a little bit of George Bailey. Brought you some hot tea and soup. Everything to make you feel better, babe. I love you. - Hey. - Hey. I want to show you something. It's okay. It's okay. Watch your step. Where are you taking me? Oh, Dave and Busters?

You tell me. Ho ho ho ho. You know, Gena, you got to mean it. This whole marriage thing, this kids, till death do us part- I know.

She had an eye infection, that- spread throughout her whole body. She made it ten days. What was her name? Lily. Pretty. She had so much hair. This curly brown hair. And she was smiling, I swear. That same smile her mom had. We maybe did it for the wrong reasons, getting married. But what we did, we did right. Is she still your wife, Paul, in your heart?
