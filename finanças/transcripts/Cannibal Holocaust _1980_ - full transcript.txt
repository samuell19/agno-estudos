Man is omnipotent. Nothing is impossible for him. What seemed to be unthinkable undertakings yesterday are history today. The conquest of the moon for example, who talks about it anymore? Today we are already on the threshold of conquering our galaxy. And in the not too distant tomorrow We'll be considering the conquest of the universe. And yet man seems to ignore the fact that on this very planet there are still people living in the stone age and practicing cannibalism. Primitive tribes isolated in ruthless hostile environments where the prevailing law is survival of the fittest. And this jungle which its inhabitants refer to as the Green Inferno is only a few hours flying time from New York City. Was it to remind us of this that four brave young Americans went there to make a documentary on life in the jungle? Was it also to remind us, for instance, that before venturing into space we should become more acquainted with the planet that we live on? Four young and fearless Americans, children of the space age: armed with cameras, microphones, and curiosity: Alan Yates. A director famous for his documentaries on Vietnam and Africa. Faye Daniels. His girlfriend and script girl. And their two cameramen and inseparable friends, Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso. Four youngsters who never came back. But let's have a look at them at the beginning of their incredible adventure, here at the border between Brazil and Peru. They are about to board a plane to take them to the Rio Ocoro, a last outpost from which they will continue on foot… deep into the Amazon Jungle… into the area known as the Green Inferno. Hey, are you really not scared? Not at all. I 've been in plenty of other dangerous places with them. What about you, Alan? Well there's only one thing scares me-- and that's marriage. He'd take me to the North Pole to put it off. I'd say he's succeeded this time too. And this is the last time. Yeah, provided we come back in one piece. Alright, alright… Let's go. Well, you four certainly aren't the first to embark on such an adventure. There was an expedition in '59, and another in '67, and neither of them came back. Ah, yeah, that was Smith and that bunch of Frenchmen. - Yes. Yeah, Frenchmen, they were amateurs, a bunch of jerks. They never succeeded in doing anything. For us the difficult doesn't exist. The impossible takes just a little more time. We'll be back. We have Felipe our guide. Say hi. Those are the last pictures we have of them. Two months have passed since they were last heard from. Are they still alive? And if so, where are they? These are the questions that the rescue team sponsored by New York University and the Pan American Broadcasting System hope to be able to answer. Thank you for accepting Professor Monroe. Good luck. Professor Harold Monroe, NYU's noted anthropologist has taken part in various expeditions exploring primitive cultures. But this will be his first journey into Amazonia. Ugha… Help him! Enough. Look at what he's carrying… a lighter! Poor Oliveira, He was only 20 years old. Once it hits the bloodstream, there is nothing one can do. Better a bullet than a dart from a blowgun. But we gave him the serum at the right time. Sure, the serum It only works half the time… if it isn't already too old by the time we get it. The guys won't give a shit after the death of Oliveira. And they are right. In a short while the American is arriving and we've got orders to help him. He's lucky. A Yacumo prisoner is like a passport into the Green Inferno. Here you are Lieutenant. Well Professor Monroe… - Do you think you can turn that--? Thanks. - All I can say is that you anthropologists and the missionaries are made out of special stuff. If hell holes like this didn't exist, I'm sure you would invent one. Whereas I'd give both my… well let's say I'd give anything to be somewhere else. Look, Lieutenant. I'll be as little trouble as possible, it's just… I'm sure you got enough problems of your own. I'll have to be honest with you… No, no thanks… I need your help in organizing this expedition. How can I refuse? You have been recommended by everybody in our community as well as yours. If only I sure can guarantee that you'll still be breathing when you return. Look, I know this is not going to be a picnic, believe me. This is not my first trip into bush. A skunk must have pissed that. Lieutenant… this lighter belonged to Faye Daniels. Come with me, Professor. I'll introduce you to your guide. He's the best there is, if you can get along with him. This looks like shit. It needs cleaning, no? Hey Chaco! This is Professor Monroe. Hello. It's nice to meet you. The lieutenant here was telling me what a… what an excellent guide you are. You gonna take all of this with you in the jungle? Yes, well forget it. We're gonna need some weapons… some ammunition plus some medicine, that's all we need. I already told your friends. In there, the more you carry, the quicker you get tired, the sooner you die. Alright, alright… All I wanna know Mr. Chaco is do we have a chance… of finding them alive? Who's to say? The only thing I know is we're gonna risk our lives to save those fuckers. Let's go see the Yacumo. Great warriors, these Yacumos! They're afraid of no one except for the Tree People. Tree People? No white man has ever seen them. - Or the ones who have, never lived to tell about it. Did you see this? Looks like the sacred scar of Ateri. That's what it is. He's a son of a shaman and he's been consecrated to the spirit of the jaguar, Which also explains what they were doing this far from home. What do you mean? Ah, they were caught, yet they are not really cannibals. Which means it was probably some religious ceremony meant to chase evil spirits outta the jungle… white men's spirits. Come on, Professor, Quit worrying about Yacumo! You can't afford to waste your strength helping that savage. He'll outlive all of us! Can you make it? We'll have to wade across. But there's no piranhas here. Come on! Come on…come on! There may not be any piranhas, but there's always a few hungry cavemen around. Leeches! Leave that shit alone. He can't do it by himself and there's three of us here, Why can't we help him? - Don't try this again Professor. Here, we do as I say, and this bastard has to know who is the strongest. Chaco's right, señor. This guy's completely full of hate. As soon as you don't look, he will slit your throat. They passed this way. Yacumos dig a hole to cook. And it means… We're following the same trail, right? Right. Hey, Professor! I recognize these teeth. This is Felipe Ocaña. He knew the jungle as well as I do. That makes me feel terrific. I wonder what was his mistake. See that? We're near his village; he can already smell his home. Hey! Hey! Mira! Here comes dinner… Hey. Mira! A muskrat! Today we eat meat, OK? This is Miguel … hurry up I'm hungry It's dying that's for sure… Hey, Chaco, what the hell are you doing? It's for our Yacumo friend. A little bit of this stuff and he'll forget all about trying to run away tonight. Atalaka, catra! This will make him very happy, just wait and see. Drug addicts in the jungle. Hey, give him some of this. A little muskrat stomach. He'll love it. You like it? Eat it it's all yours. Go on stuff yourself. What the hell is that? I swear, that looks like a ritualistic punishment for adultery. That's what it is. Just sit back and enjoy the show, because afterwards he's gonna take us to the village. Don't be a fool! Come on, Professor! That punishment is considered a divine commandment. If he had not killed her, the tribe would have killed him. Here he comes! Follow him! Well, it is no masterpiece, but it'll do. Can you guess what it is for, Professor? Oh let me try Chaco, please let me try… Okay, is it possible that this way they won't know how many of us there are until we talk with them, huh? He's learning fast eh, Miguel? Terrific, just terrific! They're coming. Where? I don't see a thing. Don't worry, they are there I know they're there, I know they're there, but where?! I don't see anything. Come on, let's send out our ambassador. Come on Miguel. Good luck Miguel! - Fuck good luck! Come on boy. We may be in trouble. Good… you've raised deductive reasoning to an art. Instinct. Something says your friends have made quite a mess of things. Wait! If Miguel pulls this off, I swear I'll buy him a bottle of whiskey. This is supposed to demonstrate their good intentions. There, they're going to show themselves now. Where the hell are you going? They're going to lead you right into an ambush. No, this is a good sign Professor. Oh yeah? You could have fooled me. They just want to show us they are brave warriors. And, they want us to follow them to their village. Follow them? Yeah, to return the prisoner and to talk. Listen, I do not know about this. I think they want us for dinner tonight. Chaco… Pretend you've seen nothing. Okay. Friends shot him. Let's hope he doesn't die from the wound. Get busy, Miguel! You can breathe easy… It's alright now, Professor. Kimnamma. Cheers, Professor! You now have the rare honor of drinking Hisimo. Yeah. The group we are looking for is probably headed for the center of the jungle or the center of the Matos, which no white man has ever seen before. This area is under the domination of two cannibal tribes. They are so fierce, they are feared by all other tribes in the area. Including the tough courageous warriors of the Yacumo Tribe. These are the two super powers of the Green Inferno, perpetually at war with each other. The Yanomano or Tree People. and Shamatari, the Swamp People. Each considers the other fair game. Hunted… then eaten. This will keep you high and dry. No, thanks. The Yacumo blame the Alan Yates' crew for the great calamity that befell them. exactly what happened remains a mystery. We only know that the four whites had-- Hey! Shut that up! God, we're in the middle of a hunt. Tree people or --? Both. Hunting each other. Let’s get going. Up there. Shamatari tribe flushing their prey. Despite the fact that our intervention saved them from the Shamatari, the tree people, although they welcomed us into their territory continue to behave strangely towards us… with a mixture of fear and distrust. Nevertheless we've been permitted to observe the execution of one of their warriors. Death by mutilation. A criminal thwarted by the chief. Criminal from the way he was destroyed. He must have done something horrible to incur the wrath of his own people. It is not clear whether it was to pay a debt of honor towrd us, or only to demonstrate how they dispense justice? Careful, they're referring to us. We weren't able to get anything out of the Yanomamo, except for the wristwatch they gave us as a token of their gratitude to an ally. An ally they continue to fear and mistrust. So I decided to try an experiment in psychology: to strip myself completely-- clothes, weapons, dog tags, rings, everything to become like them. Naked and unfettered as Adam. The Tree People would not let us bury the ghastly remains that hey had painted ochre to drive away the evil spirits which the dead represented. Once again I ask myself what unspeakable crime could have called for such atrocious retribution. I know our lives are hanging by a thread. But I can't turn back without at least trying to recover the footage Alan Yates and the others paid for with their lives. I'm thinking of the enormous human and scientific interest it's going to contain. I must do something. Chaco and Miguel can't possibly understand this. Yet, I must somehow gain the confidence of these savages. After all, they too have rules of conduct. Hold it. You did it, God damn it! They just invited us to dinner. By some incredible act of God they hadn't tried to open it. I'm hoping the climate hadn't damaged it too much. And so in exchange for the tape recorder, the Cannibal chief let you take away the cans of film. Is that it? Yes, they thought since I was capable of capturing the human voice, I was also capable of capturing their spirits. This convinced them that I was the only one capable of breaking the evil spell that had been cast over the tribe by their murder of the whites. Of course, they had no inkling of what was really in those cans. How could you explain what a movie is? They just felt they were a threat. Why do you say threat? Well the Yanomamo's understood how important these film cans were to Alan Yates's crew. They thought the silver boxes contained his power. The power, which I must say again, caused much damage and violence. A fantastic story. Thank you, Professor Monroe. You're very welcome. As we conclude this special interview we would like to remind you Wednesday, at 9 pm, here on Pantheon, we'll be presenting part one of The Green Inferno. The dramatic film testimony, of an extraordinary adventure that took its protagonists all the way back to the stone age. And you would be the ideal host of the program? That's right. Professor Monroe, as an eye witness as well as a scientist, you would be the most-- Yes… but before I make any decisions I'd like to review all the film material. As of yet we've seen none of it. Professor Monroe, I can assure you that they knew exactly what they wanted. That may be. But meanwhile, they're all dead, aren't they? Which is exactly why we have to let the public know the truth. We'll let the people be the judge. Better yet, we'll let the people who knew them best be the judge. Their parents, their wives. This is a documentary they shot for us about a year and a half ago. Can I start? - Yes, please do. Pretty powerful stuff huh? Well just to give you an idea how Alan and the others worked, everything that you just saw was a put on. - You mean this was-- - That was no enemy army approaching. Alan paid those soldiers to do a bit of acting. You'll have to excuse me now. I'll join you later. Yes, thank you. Shall I go ahead? Yeah, good news. (music from the film playing) This is Jack… Faye… Alan… And this is Mark. They've worked together for years. They were terrible prima donnas, but I have to admit they were real pros. - Mm-hmm. The stuff they shot could really gut punch you. Yeah, I can imagine. Their ratings were fantastic you know, higher than most of the big comics. And did they know how to play an audience! Alan especially. Look at this bit they shot before leaving: Yeah, we were coming back anyway. We got Felipe our guide. Come on up here! Yeah, there we go. okay. Ha! Ha! This shot's dark because the diaphragm setting on the camera was wrong. There, now he's got it right. Forget it. There's no electricity where we're going. Nope, this is anything but a well organized safari with all the comforts. Weapons. Camera. Medicinal supplies. That's about it! Since we'll be covering hundreds of miles on foot. And that's another thing… Who knows when we'll have another shower? Of course I don't think Faye will have any problem remaining the sexiest script girl in history. Are you really shooting? Jerk! Okay, okay, that's enough. Has anyone seen my pants anywhere? What do you want those for? To put them on my head, stupid! I thought ever since Jack took them off two years ago, you didn’t need 'em anymore. Right, Mark? Right! Nicer to-- Knock it off! Are you shooting again? You idiot. Crew of clowns. They had a great sense of the theatrical. Like I said, they were real professionals. Ah, what was I saying, Professor? Yeah, I tried working with Alan a couple times and I just couldn't handle it. You know he-- he pushed his people to the limit. Demanding everything, including blood. And talk about paranoia? God have mercy on his soul. He was one ruthless son of a bitch! So I feel we have a duty to tell the public their story, Mr. Yates. Alan… I don't know… You know, I really appreciate your coming. You're the first person to come and… talk to me about Alan after what happened. What I'd like to know, Professor, is… what did happen to my son? Can you tell me? Faye - no, that wasn't her real name. she always wanted to be an actress her real name was Tina. Excuse me a minute. Children, look I'm just going to be speaking with this man one more minute. And then we'll play. Okay? As you can tell we're very different in our characters. But Tina was very energetic, very hard working, very ambitious, extremely ambitious. I used to say to her: "Do you think you'll ever be at peace with yourself?" Anyway, Now she is… God rest her soul. Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Excuse me, Ms. Anders, just two minutes. How did you feel about Jack? What's the use? What am I supposed to say about Jack? After two years of marriage… I was with him for just for four months. What are you doing? I'll see ya. He was always on assignments. India, Asia, Africa. Yeah, sure he was good in bed. But, he liked to eat too. No brains though. To easily influenced. Alan was his god you know. You know what I mean? You guys think I can get any bread out of this. Ah, Mr. Tomaso, Mr. Tomaso please. Mr. Tomaso, please . I just want to ask you one question about your son. Ya what do ya wanna ask me? Look, your son was a man of special importance to the news world. Can you tell me something about him? My son, my son was no good. He doesn't work he doesn't go to school. Wants to lay around the house all day. And he's no good period Now that's it. Now I gotta go back to my job. Don't bother me no more! But Mr. Tomaso, please, your son was well known to a lot of people… just one question? Okay, one question, About your son, I just want to know what kind of man was he? My son, my son was a son of a bitch. And he was no good. That's it, my son is dead! I don't wanna talk about him no more. Now leave me alone! Good bye. Mr. Tomaso, millions of Americans-- Mr. Tomaso, please! Why didn't they print the whole thing? The negative needed special treatment because of the humidity. The quality isn't the best, but its pretty good considering the lousy conditions they were shooting in. Unfortunately two reels were light fault. we had to throw them out. I put a piece of black leader between one sequence and another. Good, that's where we will put the interviews with the families. and the one in which you talk about your search for them. - Mm-Hmm. - Go ahead Bill. -Okay. This first segment is silent. Evidently they didn't always use their mics, though they were attached right to the camera. just above the lens, like a gun barrel… see? Remember this is a very rough cut,. almost like watching rushes. A lot of this stuff will be thrown out in the actual editing. Here we are; there should be some sound coming in now. No, no, not yet. Here. (laughing) Felipe. Hey, sweet matte. We've been walking for six days in this marvelous inferno. Today is Saturday the 25th. If I were in New York right now, I'd probably be out shopping. Get the camera. Damn thing. Wait, wait, wait… How much of the material is without sound? - Less than half. - Oh. Every so often I laid in some stock music just to juice things up a little. What is it? The Yacumos passed this way We are not far from the village. (screaming) Move away! Jack, get the shot! This is fucking dangerous. -No, this is fucking cool man! Shut the fuck up! Looky here! We've been walking through the jungle for days with the harrowing feeling that we're moving in circles. At night we have to sleep in the trees, so we don't get bit by the snakes or spiders. Felipe, our guide, claims we're near the big river where the Yacumos live in their village. Look at my feet! Fucking jungle! Alan, do you want some tea? (screaming) Ahhh!!! Puta! Puta! Cut off my leg! Cut off my leg! Puta! Kill it! Kill it! Grab the leg. -Hold him down. Grab the leg! Hold him down. Hold him down! My God…Jesus Christ Cut off my leg! Cut it off! Come on put it on the fire! Come on, do it! Do it! Are you still shooting? - Yeah. Do it now! - I'm gettin' it all. Do it! Felipe was a great buddy and a top-notch guy. We'll miss him. But even more we'll miss the security he gave us. We decided to go on. But we've only got the compass and our instincts to show the way. Panning to you Alan. Faye, give us some earth shattering film takes. You know this is gonna make us famous. You think so huh? How famous? Real famous and real rich, man. What you going do with your money? I'm gonna buy a house and a piece a ass. Think that's funny huh? Yeah, that's the only way you can get it. Where's Faye? I don't know. Turn the camera off, will you? Christ, what's taking you so long? Well, I had to wait in line with the rest of the animals. You're disgusting! Hey get outta here! I told you to get outta here with the camera. Hey, I just want a little peak. Will you get outta here! - Get out of here. I told you to turn the goddamn thing off. I'll get you! - Whoo! Come on, push! Look there's a caiman. Get out of the water. No, no, forget about me. Film it, film it… Come on, get on the raft you guys. Get on the raft, hurry up! Snake! Ahh! We're saved, we're saved! By the anaconda! Saved from the jaws of death. Come on. I wonder where there village is? Just shoot in the air and follow 'em. And when they scatter how are we gonna get there? No, wait. I know what I'm doing. - Why? - Don't you get it? We can never keep up with them in the jungle. This way that buck will go slow enough to take us right to the village. Well, what do you think Professor? That it's not the best way of establishing peace with the Yacumo tribe. You know, I'm beginning to understand why they greeted us with such hostility. Do you think this is bad? This is nothing. Alan did much worse. Just watch. They could play it rough when they felt they had to. Remember how they set-up some of those executions. Faye! Here we are at the edge of the world in human history. Things like this happen all the time in the jungle. It's survival of the fittest. In the jungle it's the daily violence of the strong overcoming the weak. Jack! Hiya! Hiyah! Yiha!! Hah! Come on, get out! Jack a torch… Ready? Okay! The massacre of the Yacumos by the Yanomamos. - Right! A set-up…all a set-up! Just like Cambodia. Get this, fuckers! Heh? - That's it. That's it. Yah! Keep them inside. Keep 'em inside! Get in, Get in. Get em' back inside. It's beautiful. Alan! Here! Right! Show 'em how we do it, yeah? (laughter) Oh, fuck. Oh, you motherfucker. Get the fuck outta here. Do you believe this? You fuckin' turkey. Whoo, I'm drained. You must admit it's exceptional footage. I-I didn't expect such impact, such authenticity. I don't-- I don't think exceptional is the right word. You don't? No I mean, what's exceptional about a primitive tribe like the Yacumo being terrorized and forced into to doing something that they don't-- they don't normally do? Come on now Professor, Let's be realistic Who knows anything about the Yacumo civilization? Today people want sensationalism. The more you rape their senses the happier they are. Ah yes, that's typical western thought. civilized is it? That's what Alan thought and that's why he's dead. The Yacumo Indian is a primitive. And he has to be respected as such. You know, did you ever think of the Yacumo point of view that we might be the ones who are savages? Well, I never thought of it that way, but it's an interesting idea. - Yes. Let's say things are reversed, right, and the Yacumo attacked your house defiled everything you held holy. You know that pig that was killed? That was food for those people. Now, what would happen if someone came into your house when you're hungry and and took the little bit of food you had in the refrigerator and threw it down the toilet? Would you behave in a civilized way? Would you like people to makie money off your misery? We have succeeded in establishing shall we say… diplomatic relations with the Yacumas, but, what are we for them? These are people who have never seen a white man before, or heard the sound of a gun. We know they are really afraid of our powers. But for how long? And can we really be sure they don't hate us, like most people hate what that don't understand. When the old members of the tribe feel death approach they wander off to a secluded spot. After she dies this old woman-- This old woman will probably end up as lunch for some alligator. In the jungle nothing goes to waste, nature recycles everything. You are about to witness an ancient ritual never before seen by civilized man. The tribe is a primitive social unit. Bound together by the basic needs of survival. To protect itself, the tribe must eliminate any diseased elements. Now don't go away. What your about to see may simply be described as social surgery. Had a long discussion last nigh about whether to keep going or turn back. Wasn't easy to come to an agreement. Perhaps the others are right, maybe we shouldn't push our luck. God knows we've been lucky so far. But you know what finally convinced them? The chance to become famous. To reach that spot where… time stopped three or four thousand years ago. Where the Yanomamos, the Tree People, live in constant strife with their, their enemies the Shamatares. See this guy? This was a Yanomamo warrior, killed by the Yacumos. Just to give you an idea, to the Yacumos this is a savage. I'm not speaking as a scientist but as a man of the street. This so-called documentary footage is offensive. It is dishonest and above all, it is inhuman! Yes, yes, of course… we all know what Alan was like. He overdid it as usual. But what you saw is a rough cut. Perhaps I haven't made myself clear. But I… I refuse to have anything to do with this material. Look! Professor, we are talking about the most sensational documentary to come along in years. and you want us to just shelve it, forget about it as if it had never been found? Is that what you want? Yes, yes. That is precisely what I want. I've seen the rest of the material, you haven't. You haven't seen the stuff that even your editors didn't have the stomach to put together. And if you'd had, you wouldn't hesitate but to agree with me. John? Go ahead… We're somewhere in the middle of this Green Inferno, where no civilized man has ever been before. The ah, jungle here's different. It's almost hospitable. But so far we've seen no sign yet of these Tree People, the Yanomamos. - Good? Nice? We're beginning to wonder if they really exist or if they're just a legend. Alan! I think we got one. Look what we found. Some taste you guys have, she stinks. She's marked. What do you guys think she is? A Yanomamo or a Shamatare? How should I know? Why don't you ask her? What do you want to do with her? I'll take care of the little monkey! Judging from the looks of this girl, We finally found the Yanomamos, The Tree People. We're gonna have to be very careful, because these people are known for their cruel-- Alan, come on! Alright… alright… I got this little monkey You go first. Oh, drop on her…Oh right. I can't help it! Oh, go ahead… alright! Open! Jack! What do you want to use it for? A porno film? You stupid ass!!! That's not a bad idea… How about "Jungle Joeys" ? Hey, you want me to keep shootin'? Do you want me to keep shooting or what? That's a stupid question. Hurry up Casanova! It's Jack's turn… Jack's next! Okay Jack… go ahead. Come on. We have only three cans of film left, we can't use this! Why do you wanna waste it like that? - Shut up! Hey, aren't you gonna get some Alan? The only thing he get's off on is his camera! Okay, Mark! - Come on Indie! Stop shooting Mark! Stop it Alan!!! Aaah!! God damn you!!!! He's changing reels. Alright… move in tight, tight! Zoom in for a close up. Watch it Alan I'm shooting. Oh good Lord! It's unbelievable, it's… it's horrible! I can't understand the reason for such cruelty. Must have something to do with some obscure sexual rite or-- with the almost profound respect these primitives have for… for virginity. You're rolling Mark? - Yeah. Look up there on the right. Wait they're all around us! Keep rolling. We're gonna get an Oscar for this. Jack!!! Alan, Alan you can't! You can't! Look he's had it anyway… - He's still alive you bastard! -You can't! You can't! - How much you want-- Get the fuck off me! Goddamn it! Keep filming Mark, I'll cover you. You got it! Right down to the last foot. We really screwed ourselves this time. trying to stay there for the last shot. I don't even know where we are now. But, I know that… I know they, ah, they followed us, and and we lost everything trying to escape. We're screwed! We're trapped! I'm gonna try and scare 'em away with this. I hope it works. Stay by me, Faye! Don't get too far away! Stay over here! You motherfuckers! Alan! Please help me! - Faye!!! Faye! Hey, Alan! Ahhhh!! Help me! Alan! She's had it! We've gotta think of ourselves! Hey! We've gotta take the film back home, Alan! Think of the film. Save the film. Save the film! Burn it. John. I want this material burned. All of it. Yeah. I wonder who the real cannibals are.
