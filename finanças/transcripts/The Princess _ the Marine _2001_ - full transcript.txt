[PEOPLE CHATTERING] The king is Sheik Isa Al-Khalifa. The prime minister is Sheik Khalifa Al-Khalifa. The foreign affairs minister is Sheik Mohammed Al-Khalifa. The minister of justice is Sheik Abdullah Al-Khalifa. We get the picture, a whole busload of Al-Khalifas. It's the royal family. It looks like they've been running Bahrain for 300 years. 300 years, you'd think they could come up with some more names. In 18 hours, you think you could come up with something more interesting to read? I like to learn about new things. [MARINE SHOUTING] All the way in. Let's go. All the way. Everybody out. JASON: Come on. Fall in. Here is the Manai Plaza. The most secure military residence in the Gulf. You're gonna keep it that way. A little incentive, you're gonna live in it as well as guard it, so you let it get blown up, you're confetti, too. Understood? MARINES: Yes, Sergeant. Okay. Point number two, and listen good. This is a Muslim country. No booze in public and keep it zipped. You hear me? MARINES: Yes, Sergeant. I cannot emphasize it enough, this is a totally different culture. Oh, look at that. Thank you so much. Look at you. See. A little talking picture frame so you can look at Mabel all day, and if you press this button, she'll talk. [LAUGHING] You look lovely, Meriam. Thank you, Ammi. [DOORBELL RINGING] Have a sniff, dear. Oh, Ismelda, these smell terrific. [GREETING IN ARABIC] Zayn, hi. Welcome to my house of henna. You're so crazy. Did I already miss everything? No, no, no. We saved you an appendix. Okay. Okay, right there. Zayn, hurry up. I've been waiting and waiting. [GREETING IN ARABIC] Not too many... [GREETING IN ARABIC] Isn't it beautiful? Sabika, I hope you realize how lucky you are to have her as your cousin. If you were mine, you'd look like something with a skin disease. Come on. You're good at other things. Like what? Like algebra. Oh, yeah. That's what she wants for her wedding next week. Equations. I'm sticking to the parts that nobody can see. When I get married, Meriam's going to do all my painting. So, Mooney, are you already asked for? MOONEY: Nope, Meriam first, 'cause she's the older sister. Then Tifa, then me. Poor Meriam, who's gonna paint her? It doesn't matter. I'm not getting married that fast. That's what you say now, but wait until you're asked for. But, Sabika, doesn't it bother you, marrying someone that you don't know? I know him. I've sat with him twice. Yeah, with your parents all around you. But he's gorgeous. He's got this lovely little curl and he's devout. He'll be imam and I'm going to wear the full veil. Yeah, but do you love him? Love comes. That's what my sister says. That's normal. Men have their worlds and we have ours. That's not how I want to live. That is how you live. That's how we all live. It's time you got used to it. Well, I don't care. I'm never getting married. Not unless I love someone and he loves me. Meriam? Huh? Do you love Rashid? Rashid? I've heard Mommy and Daddy talking. Mooney. Daddy's picked Rashid. Rashid's going to ask for you. Hey, Rashid's not so bad. With Rashid, all he cares about is cars and showing off his daddy's money. You have to marry him. We're Al-Khalifa. We have to marry Al-Khalifa. [COUGHING] Your asthma? No, I'm okay. ZAYN: Maybe you should go get your inhaler thingy. It's okay. Okay. Here, take some pastries. Ismelda will die if you don't. She worked on them all day. Go get some rest. [GASPING] LAYLA: Hello. Layla? Meriam? Are you done painting? Oh, I could've come if I'd known you'd be done so early. No, I need to talk to you. It's Eid-al-Adha. I'm going to the mosque. I'm going to be asked for. That's wonderful. No, it isn't. We'll talk all about it tomorrow. No, hold on. I've gotta go. Bye, Meriam. Layla. [PHONE RINGING] WOMAN: Hello. Hi. Uh, who's this? Who is this? Meriam. My name's Meriam. I don't have any friends named Meriam. Well, now you do. Well, Meriam, you shouldn't be calling people that you don't know. Well, then how am I ever gonna meet anyone new? [PHONE DISCONNECTS] Man, that whole suitcase full of candy? Nope. I got some fruitcakes, too. And pecans. Texas pecans are about the finest in the land. You know that? Personally, I'll take Miss October any day of the week. How'd you get that thing through Customs? Hey, you can take the Marine out of Jersey, but you can't take the Jersey out of the Marine. So, what are we hiding in here? What's this? Book of Mormon. You one of those guys that has 17 wives? We don't do that anymore. What, you don't get married? So what, you hiding pictures of 17 girlfriends? Nope. No girlfriends. What, you don't like girls? JASON: I like girls. I just believe you should wait for someone special. Anyways, I spent the past two years doing missionary work. I didn't have time to date. Mormon girls don't put out? SMITTY: You from Utah? Las Vegas. Las Vegas. You couldn't get lucky in Las Vegas? Watch the fingertips. Smitty, my man, you and I have a mission. We are going to find a woman for this man. SMITTY: All right. WOMAN: Manai Plaza. What room would you like please? Um... 133. [RINGING] And there she is. Who's got this number? Fate. Answer the phone, Jase. Hello. TRUCKER: Hello. Hi, uh... This is Meriam. Who's this? Lance Corporal Trucker, US Marine Corps. Trucker to you, ma'am. Hi, Trucker. Say, you the little girl I saw downstairs? Uh... No, I just wanted someone to talk to. Well, hey, Meriam, you can talk to me. [WHISPERING] It's a girl, it's a girl. So, how old are you anyway? 17. I'll tell you what, baby, you got any friends? I have lots of friends. I'm a very popular person. I mean girlfriends. I only have girlfriends. Well, you think you and your girlfriends could come hang out with my buddies and me? You know, grab a Coke or something? I mean, if you all got Coke here. No, I don't think my girlfriends could do anything like that. Well, how about you? Meriam? Uh... I'll be at the Desert Mall tomorrow after school at 2:30. We got a date. With a girl in high school. And we won't even be able to see her. Right. She's gonna be wearing all those veils. So what, man? Cheer up. Your luck is changing. I'm not going. My man, get a grip. We doin' this for you. You know what, Trucker, it's not Jersey. You should read the guide book. You screw around with a woman, they could chop off both your heads. So maybe she ain't Muslim. Maybe she's a Methodist. Maybe she's a Mormon. In case you didn't notice, she called us. Yeah, we're just gonna talk to her. Yeah, you say you want to learn about new things. Why not learn about a new person? All right, I'm in.

Talk about a needle in a haystack. Tootsie Rolls. Just like being at home. SALESWOMAN: May I help you? ZAYN: They're perfect. They go exactly with that outfit. Hi. What a cute little baby. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Meriam, what do you think about those shoes? My asthma is acting up, you guys. I think I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Do you want me to come with you? No, no, I might just go home. This is stupid. This is stupid. This is stupid. Hey. I can't talk right here. Meet me at the west stairs. See you there. Is that her? I think so. She told me to meet her in the west stairs. So, you weren't serious about that chopping off the head stuff? No, I was serious. Over the causeway in Saudi in 1977, there was a Princess Meshaw and her boyfriend. They chopped off his head. They only shot her. Only? Well, yeah, but that's a princess. We're just folks. So, let's go. Let's not be too obvious about this. Hey, man, you broke my Tootsie Roll. JASON: The eagle has landed. More like a turkey. I'm Trucker. I'm Smitty. I'm Jason. Hi. You know, um, we gotta get out of here. We got a car over there. We can take you home if you want. Or we can go for a ride. Preferably where no one's gonna kill us. Okay. The car's this way. Not so close this time, okay? What are these? Dates. No kidding. Enjoy it. This is the only date you gonna get in this country. [ALL LAUGHING] Meriam, go long. Hey, she doesn't know about football. What, you don't think I can catch it? No, I think you can do anything. I just don't know if you should. You don't think I should be here. No. What happens if someone sees you with us? I could go to jail. Trucker. [MERIAM GIGGLING] You're supposed to catch it, Meriam. Thanks. Hey, Truck. Post pattern, Smitty. So, uh, what makes us worth the risk? Well, my whole life people have always told me what I shouldn't do. And I just wanted for once someone to say, "Yes. Go ahead. Take a chance. Try it." I just don't think you know what you're getting yourself into. Well, if I did, what would be the point? Hey, Jason. Go out. SMITTY: It's a bomb. TRUCKER: All right, good catch. That wasn't bad. That wasn't bad. Let me see yours. Come on, Jase. Who you throwing to, man? Where are you throwing it? So, you're here because you believe in your country? Yeah, that's right. My mom says I watched one too many John Wayne movies. I'm what they call a career Marine. So, I guess I believe in my country. What do you believe in? I don't know. No one's ever really asked me that before. No one's ever cared. I care. You care. I believe I was born in the wrong place. You always this direct? I guess I care what other people think. Including me? Yeah, including you. Well, then, personally I don't know what I believe in. I just know I haven't found it yet. Hey, what's going on back here? Anyway, my mother says I watch too many movies, too. Meg Ryan movies. Maybe I believe in love. Remind me to leave you at home next time. JASON: Come on. MERIAM: You can drop me here. Bye, guys. TRUCKER: Bye, Meriam. Bye. I'll see you. Wait till she gets inside. [MAN CHATTERING IN ARABIC] Well, I'm not seeing Stuart Littleagain and that's that. [THANKING IN ARABIC] What is this? First Knight? Yeah. Come on, everyone's dressed in metal. It's totally safe. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. [SWORDS CLANGING ON SCREEN] KNIGHT 1: Wanna know how to win a sword fight? KNIGHT 2: Yeah. Be the only one with a sword. SMITTY: Yeah. Guy's a cheater. TRUCKER: No kidding. KNIGHT 1: Give him a hand. He fought well. Meriam, stop. There are men there. MERIAM: Oh, well, they're Americans, so it does... It doesn't matter. Why doesn't it matter? Look, you guys, I know them, and they're really nice. Come on, Zayn, just do this for me. Leave a seat between. Thank you. KNIGHT 1: ...so fearless, no man can touch me. Hi. This is Trucker, Jason and Smitty. This is Zayn and Layla. Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you, anyway. Oh, Houston, we've got a veil. Can I offer you girls, um, some Butterfingers or some other candy that we can't pronounce? Lakamedalisa. Why did he buy it if he can't pronounce it? The question is, how did he buy it if he can't pronounce it? I asked for a Tootsie Roll, but I guess I kind of mumbled. WOMAN: Why have we stopped? MAN: I'm tired. Never. You battle in your dreams. What are you doing? You'll see. Now, drink. WOMAN: Again. [WOMAN MOANING] Where did you learn to do that? Well, I've lived most of my life out in the open. Don't you have a home? No. I don't have a home. Not for a long time. That must be hard. What is she thinking? Hey. Sure I can't I offer you a Butterfinger? I've nothing to lose. I always eat when I'm upset. [WOMAN SPEAKING ARABIC] Thirsty? Yeah. Well, it's important to stay hydrated in the desert. I bet you say that to all the girls. No. Just the ones who live in deserts. [WOMAN SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING IN ARABIC] Uh, one of those, a Tootsie Roll and, uh, some popcorn please. [SPEAKING IN ARABIC] Have you had a lot of girlfriends? Um, a couple. I mean, some. One. Well, what was she like? She, uh, was really good at subtraction. Um, she sat in front of me in the second grade. Do I, um, do I look like her? No. Uh, sure. Was she pretty? Yeah, sure. Uh, I mean, but you're pretty, too. I mean, you're prettier and she never let me look at her papers. I bet you would. Why? You think I'm dishonest? No. Thank you. It's just that I think you'd do what you think is right, and, you know, the heck with the rest. I was just wondering if I could be as bold as you. You're a Marine. Yeah, a rule-following Marine. Well, I'd follow the rules if I believed in them. Sometimes I wish I could. Like right now? No, not right now. We, um, we better get back in. Yeah, okay. LAYLA: That was so scary. ZAYN: You think so? I thought the photography was beautiful. I'm not talking about the movie. I'm talking about them. Come on. You're gonna ruin your reputation. I don't care. Well, we do. Think about us. What if someone saw Zayn talking to that boy? That Trucker. Well, Zayn didn't talk to him, so... I did, when you went to get your soda. Okay. So did he say anything interesting? No. But it doesn't matter because we're never gonna see them again. Ever. You, too? Well, then I guess I'll just have to see 'em myself. Meriam. He makes me think. Bye, ladies. Ciao. Good night. Bye. Come on. Let's go. Okay, lover boy. You and us have to have a talk. What are you talking about? Well, you know what happened in the theater. Yeah, and then what? I got up and I left and I walked past, which you saw. JASON: Hey, Truck, why are we going out the front door? The van's in the back. Strategic positioning. Huh? SMITTY: Don't we gotta get back to Manai? Yo, Truck, what are you doing? Shut up, pucker down and take a look. Did little Meriam tell you her last name while you were out getting cozy? We weren't getting cozy, we were getting snacks. Well, Zayn did. Al-Khalifa. Zayn Al-Khalifa? No, Meriam Al-Khalifa, you nimrod. As in His Highness Sheik Isa Al-Khalifa, the Prime Minister Sheik Khalifa Al-Khalifa. The Foreign Affairs Minister Sheik Mohammed Al-Khalifa. The Minister of Justice Sheik Abdullah Al-Khalifa. Wow, Truck, you got a pretty good memory. She is royalty. She lives next door to the prime minister. This is serious stuff. No. No, it's not true. It is true. Look. You gotta pull the plug right now. No. She's a princess. A princess. That guy who got his head chopped off, it happened 15 miles from here. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [PHONE RINGING] [RINGING] JASON: How many times do I have to tell you guys? I'm not her boyfriend. I'm her friend. Tell that to the guy with the axe. I think they use scimitars. I been looking it up. I'm pretty sure they use scimitars. And you might want to consider your career, Jase-man. I thought you wanted to do this for life. Which might not be for very long. Want a pecan? No. My career is fine. I'm up for a promotion. The Royal Family tells the Major you messed with a minor, and you, my friend, could be up for a long ride home. And so could we. So could she. Man, these people don't fool around. You know that. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go shoot some pool, man. [PHONE RINGING] [SPEAKING ARABIC] You want to go so early? Yes. No breakfast? No. At least some juice. I'll eat at school. [THANKING IN ARABIC] Thanks, Sayed. I got the door. [BIDDING FAREWELL IN ARABIC] Manai Plaza. TRUCKER: I'll take the right perimeter. Oh, man. Oh, jeez. Great. Romeo and Juliet. Yeah, but Juliet was on the roof. No one was on the roof. Okay, balcony. Fox One to Phoenix, over. MAN: Fox One, go ahead. Fox One requesting relief. Roger that. Wait a minute. Whoa! You're not going down there? Yeah, I am. Yo, they don't give promotions to headless Marines. She had enough guts to come all the way down here. I'm at least gonna see what she has to say. Hey. Hey. Why didn't you tell me who you were? You follow the rules. I thought if you knew... I was afraid I wouldn't have you to talk to anymore. I was afraid I'd lose you. Me, too. That's why you didn't answer the telephone? Yes. Big tough Marine. No, I'm not a big tough Marine. You know what? If I was, I would keep this up. I would keep seeing you. Meriam, I'm gonna be fine. I am a US Marine. Your government's not gonna take on the whole Corps, but I'm afraid for you. You're outside on the line. You're all alone. I know. But I wouldn't be alone if you were with me. You know, if John Wayne had you at the Alamo, he probably would have won. Okay. Okay. I'll see you at the mall at 1600. Yes, sir.

Just take us someplace safe, okay? Okay. All right. Go straight. Yeah, this is safe all right. Come here. I wanna show you something. Whoa. Look at that thing. It's the Tree of Life. The symbol of Bahrain. Where does it get water? No one knows. It's a mystery. I like that. So do I. Come on. Some people say this was the tree in the Garden of Eden. Is there a snake up there? No. How can you be so sure? 'Cause I used to come here when I was little. I used to climb all the way to the top and I thought I could see everything in the world. When did you stop coming? When I was 12. When I became a woman. An amazing woman. Because of you. I seriously doubt that. No, I mean it. Jason, can't you see? I'm so happy. Mrs. Al-Khalifa, this is Lieutenant Ibrahim Ibn Hamad of the Bahrain Secret Police. We're going to Grandma's house for dinner. No. Not Meriam. Just us. Ammi? Ammi? [PHONE RINGING] WOMAN: Manai Plaza. You kissed him. No. In the desert, at the Tree of Life. You kissed him. No. No, I didn't. The Secret Police saw your lips on his. The Secret Police. You had me... You had me followed? I don't need to have you followed, Meriam. Everybody knows who you are! Everybody but me. I trusted you. I trusted you. I should never have let you go to that mall to those American movies. Kissing in public. What do you do when no one can see? Nothing! Fornicating is not nothing, Meriam. I didn't... Do you know what they will do to your father? Do you know what your father will do to us? He didn't do anything. I never did that. He is an American. That's all they want. Mommy, he never even touched me. I can have you examined. Okay, well, then go ahead. Go ahead and have me examined, okay? Because I love him and he loves me. He loves you? Yes. In six months, he'll be back in America. Where will you be? Here. Here! And if this gets out, alone. Your whole life, alone. No man will want you. All right, you have five minutes to call him and tell him it's over. No. [PLEADING IN ARABIC] Then you bring the telephone down to me. You will no longer have the use of it. You'll no longer leave this house except to go to school. You will no longer speak to your sisters except in my presence. I am so sorry now we don't wear the veil. Mommy? You are not my child anymore. [PHONE RINGING] WOMAN: Manai Plaza. Room 133. I can't hear you, ma'am. 133. Connecting. [PHONE RINGING] Lance Corporal Johnson. MERIAM: Jason. Meriam. Meriam, what's the matter? I can't see you anymore. [BELL RINGING] [GIRLS CHATTERING] Bye-bye. Oh, man. We've been looking for you. You're wiggin' out here, bro. I don't know what they're gonna do to her. She was screaming about secret police, about doctors. If I have to, I'm gonna bust her out of there. And take her where exactly? Bahrain's an island. She show up at school? Yeah. She still have her head attached to her body? So she's okay. Yeah, she's okay. She just didn't look good. She's alive. You're alive. Under the circumstances, that's more than we expected. Look, you had some good times together, man. Let it go. I love her. Oh, jeez. You had a one-year assignment. How exactly did you expect this to turn out? I don't know. Well, luckily, I do. You back off. A couple of months, her mother will probably relax a little and let her out, and the two of you can have a few more months of fun. Or you can stay camped out here and the Corps bounces you back into some brig and you never see her again, period. And that's if her daddy don't shoot you first. Huh? Meriam? It's my birthday. I know. Happy birthday, Mooney. Mommy's taking me to the mall to buy me presents. Tifa already bought me one. I want one from you, too. Hey, someone's a little greedy, huh? Please, will you come? Okay. [EXCLAIMING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Meriam! Meriam, look! Um, Mooney, I can't afford it. MOONEY: Please. He's so cute. Mommy, will you buy him for me? MOTHER: You have so many already. MOONEY: I could keep him in the corner of my room. Near the rocking chair. I could put him next to my teddy bear. Please, Mommy? Please. Mommy, can I go over to that store over there and buy her a necklace? Thank you. Why don't we go take a look? Can I borrow a pen and a piece of paper? Sure. Oh, thank you. Can you do me another favor? You see that boy over there in front of the food court? Could you give this to him? Please? Please? You won't steal anything? No, I'll stay right here. I have to buy a necklace. I promise. What does it say? Hey, what did he write you? "Will you marry me?" [MOUTHING] I love you. I love you. MERIAM: Dear Jason, I write and I write but I never know if I will get to the mall to leave all these letters. Eleven, twelve, I've stopped counting. But I have to write. I miss your eyes. I miss your smile. But most of all, I miss talking to you. I miss talking. I miss your mind. I miss mine. Meriam? Yeah? My necklace broke, and I hardly ever wore it. Oh, uh... Well, that's not right. Why don't you ask Mommy to take us to the mall, and then we can get it fixed? Why don't you ask her? Why doesn't she talk to you anymore? She talks to me. No, she doesn't. Not for months and months and months. I've been counting. It's something that happens between mothers and girls. Sometimes. When a girl thinks God and prayer and family aren't sufficient. And then she gets older and she understands. Understands what? That we are the lucky ones. That our lives are sacred. That we have the knowledge to dedicate ourselves entirely to what is good. Come, why don't you pray with me, Meriam? And then we will go to the mall. MERIAM: Dear Jason, I have begun university. The dressmaker came to measure me for my clothes, so I didn't even have to leave the house to buy them. And, of course, they're all very long. My new clothes, covering every bit of me because there are boys in my classes. The university is coed, so it's very important I don't appear ruined. I don't feel ruined, though. Jason, I feel alive for the very first time. I wanna make choices about more than what shoes to buy. I wish I could marry you now, but I know that's just a dream. I know that soon you'll be leaving and your life will go on, and my life will end. You know, this is broken after three weeks. Do you think that you could fix it? The receipt is in the bag. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] It would be easier if I give you a new one. Okay. Can I offer you some money? No, that's okay. This is fun for me, not a business. Thank you. When I'm older, I'm going to ask Daddy to buy me a store to play in. JASON: Dear Meriam, I write every day, and every day I go to the jewelry shop, but you haven't picked up my letters for almost a month. I know you told me to be patient, but I can't stand not knowing if anyone has hurt you. I keep worrying that I'll be sent back to Pendleton without ever seeing your face again. My year here is up in 20 days. I owe two more years to the Marines after that. If you won't come with me now, I'll come for you then. Sooner or later, you're gonna be my bride. But trust me, though it seems impossible, I will get you out of here now if you want me to. Please, tell me that you want me to. Sergeant, I've fallen in love with this girl. She can't marry me because I'm not a member of the royal family. No kidding. I would like to contact the US Embassy and see if she can get some sort of political asylum, Sergeant. No, Johnson, I don't think that's a good idea. If she tries to leave here with me, they'll probably kill her, Sergeant. Then probably she'd better not try to leave. [PHONE RINGING] I don't wanna leave her behind, Sergeant. We're talking about a piece of tail. You get back to the States, you find another one. Here you are, Sarge. No, Sergeant. Trust me, Johnson, you will. Her family knows about me. I'm afraid they'll hurt her once I'm gone from here. Not our problem. Do you understand? Yes, Sergeant. Then you're dismissed. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] So what are we doing out here? I went to the Corporal, the Gunny, the Sergeant. Same answer. "She's just a piece of tail. Forget her." Oh, this is an interesting way of forgetting her. Wandering around an airport in the middle of the night. [WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA] You're gonna bust her out, aren't you? That's right. Okay, I'm out of here. Hey, you won't be involved. I'm involved right now. I'm out here with you. You'll be gone 24 hours before I pull this off. All I need from you two is your military ID. Our ID? That's right. Look at that. Look at what? Military doesn't get asked for passports. Just Bahraini. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [SNIFFLING] Meriam, the wonders of a digital camera and a computer. When did you take my picture? I took it one day at your school. Diana Escobebo. Escobebo, yeah. I figured you were more of a Puerto Rican than a Marcia Brady. I typed orders for you, too, assigning you to the States. What time?11:00. 11:00. What if they catch us? Failure's not an option. What if I can't go? I mean, Mooney, my mother, this will destroy her. This is my home, Jason. In many ways, it's been really good to me. It's a good place. It's sacred. I don't know what to do. I'm not gonna try to talk you into anything. I'm just gonna tell you what you told me. If you stay here, it will destroy you. I mean, you don't even know me. I mean, maybe I'm lazy. Maybe I snore. Maybe I snore, too. Maybe we snore in harmony. Maybe we can snore duets. The first day that you met me, you said that you were looking for someone to say to you, "Yes, go ahead. Take a chance. Try it." Right. And you told me that I didn't know what I was getting into. And you told me that if you did, what would be the point? [CAR HORN HONKING] Your driver's here. Listen. Listen. I'll be at your house at 11:00 tonight. It's okay if you don't come. I'll wait for you forever. I'll wait for you. Okay. Okay. Goodbye. Meriam, whatever happens, I will wait for you. [SIGHS] [SINGING] My brothers always frowned on me. I indulged you. I let you sneak off to the mall without your father knowing. I let you wear your skirts so short. I remember being young. I wanted you to have a little freedom. Do you understand how you betrayed me? Mommy, I needed more than just a little. Then my brothers were right. All women should be kept in veils, behind locked doors, for they are weak and will always succumb to temptation. God made me, too. And I don't believe that the prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, thought that all women were so useless. His first wife, Hadija, was his boss. She hired him. She supported him. She proposed to him. I mean, she was an international trader. I can be a good Muslim and not be weak. Do you love my father? Of course. Well, did you love him when you married him? I didn't know him. Do you know him now? Of course. I've lived with him more than half my life. Does he know you? [DOG BARKING] [GASPS] [ENGINE REVVING] [GASPING] Meriam. Meriam. Jason. Jason. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I rented a car so I'd blend in. Are you sure you can do this? Are you sure? I'm sure. Hey. Marines don't cry. They wait. That's right. They wait. That's right. They stay at their post. They wait. Come on. Come on. We gotta get going. We miss our flight, we're both screwed. Okay. There's some grunge clothes there on the floor. Put 'em on. Okay. Don't look. Babe, I'm not looking, we're still in Bahrain. MERIAM: Delayed? Will your mother check on you before she goes to sleep? No, but my sister will be in in the morning. What time? Around 7:00. I hope we get off on time. Someone's gonna recognize me. No, no, no. We're US Marines. Remember what I told you. Look up, all right? They don't look at Marines. If your asthma kicks in, go straight to the bathroom. It's not gonna kick in. Okay. Stand up straight. Remember what I told you. Here we go. Okay. Johnson, Escobebo. I'm sorry. That flight is full. Well, it can't be full. We're US Marines. We have orders to be in the States tomorrow. I'm sorry. We've got orders to be on that flight. Find us some room. Uh, one moment please. Look right at him. Look hard. [MEN SPEAKING ARABIC] Okay. It's no problem. Any baggage? Just one. Look, that was the easy part. Easy part? Yeah. They're gonna look at your face now. What? You could be a Bahraini. Thank you. Okay, stick with me. What if I can't stick with you? Want some gum? No. Yeah, you do. Wait, I'll choke. What... Marines chew gum, all right? Nice and loud. Slower, slow, slow. Just like Smitty. There you go. Okay, this is it. [GUARD SPEAKING ARABIC] No antiquities? Just pants. Just pants? She's with me. The rest of her stuff's in my bag. She was washing those. You know, women. [SCOFFS] Women. Thank you. WOMAN ON PA: Flight 631, non-stop service to New York. JASON: Welcome to Chicago. MERIAM: What happens now? Well, I've got a month's leave. We can stay here or we can take a flight to Vegas to see my family. Your family? What are they gonna think of me? They're gonna love you. How do you know? Because they know my taste is perfect. Well, you don't really even know me. Why do you keep saying that? It's not true. You've written me 57 letters and I've kept every one of 'em and I read them over and over. And I must have wrote you back 50 or 60. We've shared our deepest thoughts. You know my soul, Meriam, and I know yours. I love you. 53. What? You wrote me 53 letters. And I read every one of them every day. One of these days we'll have to put 'em in a scrap book and give 'em to our grandkids. We can't. I left too fast to take them. Then they're... They're still there? Miss Al-Khalifa, we need you to come with us. Wait. She's with me. We're together. Not for long. You're a citizen of the US, and she's a citizen of the emirate of Bahrain. Let go of her, Jason. And she's gonna be on the first plane home. She's done nothing wrong. She's a minor in her country. She's got no passport. How were you planning on getting her in here? Do you have any identification with you? Who made these? JASON: I did. Forgery. Fraud. If you're smart, you'll get out of here right now. I'm not leaving her. I'm afraid you don't have any choice. Miss Al-Khalifa, we need you to come with us. No. No! GUARD: Sir. Please, come with us. Jason! Meriam! Jason! Meriam! Don't make this any worse than it is, man. The Corps is gonna ream you for this. Where are you taking her? Jason! Where are you taking her? Keep cool! Immigration detention, all right? Now you just go get your stuff and call INS. Meriam, don't give up! I'll get you out! I'll check on the next two outbound flights. Who are we talking to, the family or the secret police? Okay, she's here. Miss Al-Khalifa, you have any idea what you've done? This island cuts at 15 km off the coast of Saudi Arabia. It's connected by a causeway. Your little stunt almost caused a nice fat international incident. You could have destabilized the entire Gulf. The father called the police. The police called us. The specific violation is attempting to enter with false ID. Can you imagine how your parents must be feeling? We're invoking Expedited Removal. It's a provision of the 1996 Immigration Law. It means no lawyer, no judge. You're on the next plane home. When is the next plane? WOMAN 1: 5:35. WOMAN 2: And you can forget any idea that Jason is going to save you. He works for our government and the government wants you gone. MAN 1: It's time. Which gate? WOMAN 1: C-5. Who's gonna walk her down? MAN 2: I will. You have any checked luggage, Meriam? WOMAN 1: Who's got her ticket? MAN 1: I do. No baggage. Okay. Let's go. You understand your escort will be armed. If you do anything stupid, they'll have to shoot you. Oh, yeah, then we really will have an international incident. Jim, we followed everything by the book. We got the evidence. All right, put a sock in it, all of you. You're scaring the girl. Are you here of your own free will? I have to hear it. Yes. Do you want to stay? Jim, we can't... It's a problem. Yes. Then you can ask for asylum. You're entitled to a hearing. Yeah, I can't go back there. I'm afraid here isn't going to be much fun. Back home, you're a princess. To us, you're just one more illegal. Well, at the hearing can Jason be with me? No. You have to do this on your own. You think you can? Look, why don't you just forget it? Take the plane. Have you ever been to Bahrain? No. I hear it's a very beautiful country, if you like a lot of sand. They have a tree there called the Tree of Life. And that is beautiful. Wanna know why? Sure. Because it has no right to be there. It's in the desert. There's no water around it. Nothing green anywhere. And what's your point? You all say that I have no right to be here. But I'm staying. I'm gonna stay. Okay. [WOMEN INMATES CLAMORING] INMATE: Guard! Guard? Guard, I need to talk to you! You said that before. I need to talk to you now! JASON: Just tell me where she is. No, don't tell me you don't know, and don't tell me to stop calling. It's been three days. She's only 18. What's the matter with you people? Could you at least tell me if she's still in this country? I've done the worst thing that I could do. I fell in love with a foreigner. An American and a Christian. All of these are forbidden to me. WOMAN: But your parents love you. They want you back. Do you really think they would hurt you? It's not just my parents. I dishonored every Al-Khalifa, my entire country. But it's still a liberal country for all that. When I was 15 years old, this woman, Natasha Goostrey, came back to Bahrain with her British husband, you know, to visit. Her relatives refused to recognize the marriage. They told her that they were gonna lock her away, force her to have an operation to restore her virginity, and she would never be allowed to leave Bahrain ever again. She and her husband hid for eight weeks before they could escape from there. And do you think something like that would happen to you? I don't know. I don't know. I'm just afraid. I'm afraid, and I can't go back there. And aren't you afraid here? You know, we invited Jason to this interview. He didn't show up. He's gone back to Las Vegas. He's abandoned you. No. No, I don't believe you. Marines stay at their post and they wait. They wait. [SNIFFLING] They wait. [BUZZER BUZZING] Meriam, you okay? Give it up. I know this isn't what you're used to. This is exactly how I lived. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? MAN: Get down to immigration and pick her up. She's got temporary asylum. [PHONE DISCONNECTS] Wait. Which office? Wait! Excuse me, sir, can you tell me where the INS deten... [CHATTERING] Meriam! So this must be the boyfriend. Yes, sir. I hope you're worth it. I hope I am, too, sir. Mr. Kennedy was really good to me. I can't thank you enough. No, you can't. Now look, you go out and get her a good lawyer. There's a hearing in 90 days. You're not home free by a long shot. Right. Okay, let's get you out of here. Okay. Thank you again. Thank you. Thanks. [SIGHS] [WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA] [SPEAKING ARABIC] Got the bags. Hey, you win? You know, I have no idea. Babe. Uh-huh? You gotta pull it. [CHUCKLING] Oh. Well, you pull it. I can't. Mormons don't gamble. [CHUCKLING] How did you ever end up with me? I knew you were a sure thing. Go ahead, pull it. [BEEPING] [LAUGHING] Hey. You see that? We're winners.Yeah. Jason! Jason! That's my mom. Oh, Jason! Oh, Jason. What have you done now? DALE: Welcome back, Son. How you doing, crazy Mom? Hey, Dad. What about this poor girl? She's crazier than me. Come here, Meriam. Meriam, this is my stepmom. This is my dad. Dale, Susan. DALE: Hi, darling. Hi. Sweetheart, you look exhausted. Give me a hug. Oh. [CHUCKLING] You know I couldn't leave her behind, Mom. SUSAN: Well, let's go home. We'll take the elevator up to the car. It's faster. JASON: Go ahead. I'll catch up with you. Hey, let me help you with that. The Marines called. They're gonna cancel your leave. They want you back tomorrow. Something about, uh, forgery, fraud. [MERIAM LAUGHING] And they strongly suggest you not marry this girl. PRIEST: To have and to hold from this day forward. JASON AND MERIAM: To have and to hold from this day forward. For better for worse. For better for worse. For richer or for poorer. For richer or for poorer. In sickness and in health. In sickness and in health. To love and to cherish. To love and to cherish. Till death do us part. Till death do us part. You each say, "I do." [SIGHS] I do. Last chance to back out. I do. And now, by the power vested in me by the City of Las Vegas, State of Nevada, I now declare you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. I wish you kids would've let us spring for a fancier dinner on your wedding day. Meriam had her heart set on Taco Bell. I told you she was crazy. Well, I wanted American food. Stevie, help Meriam find some hangers up in my closet. We bought much too much for so late at night. Oh, that's okay. I'll just take it with me for breakfast tomorrow. You at least tell that poor child that tacos aren't American. Yes, sir. A geography lesson before she goes to bed. Come here. Sleep tight. No, no, ma'am. I have no intention of sleeping. This is my wedding night. I could go to the brig tomorrow for the rest of my life. I know. [CRYING] I know. Don't you think Meriam ought to call home? It's only about noon in Manama. And you just knew that off the top of your head? I always know what time it is wherever you are. I'll ask her. Mom was asking if maybe you wanted to call your mother. MERIAM: She won't talk to me. Wanna try? How many hours do we have? About six. When will I see you again? I don't know, babe. Calling me back like this isn't good. Maybe not for a long time. Then I'm not doing anything now but be with you. I don't know what to do. We'll figure it out. You're here now. We're together. We're safe. Wave goodbye to your brother, honey. Come on, honey. Let's go back inside. Thanks, honey. You have dishwashers in Bahrain? Uh, Ismelda washes the dishes. Sometimes Romero. No, I mean, like, you know, machines, like this. I don't know. I never really looked. Well, you wanna try loading? I believe in rinsing. Some don't. Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, that's okay. Sorry. Don't cut yourself. I broke it. It's okay. It's only a plate. Do you think they're gonna send Jason to prison? I don't know, honey. I just don't know. It's not fair. He did it for me. Maybe. But I've never seen him happier. We should all have such a moment of pure happiness in our lives. OFFICER: You did a stupid thing. You forged military documents. You tarnished the reputation of the Corps, and you broke the laws of the emirate of Bahrain, a valuable ally. And for this, you're going to have to pay. It has not escaped my attention, however, that over the past two years you've served both your country and the Corps with distinction, and that you did attempt to deal with your situation as required through the chain of command. You took matters into your own hands. And now you and your bride have to face the consequences in another court of law. Insofar as the Marine Corps goes, you are to be stripped of all insignia and authority and reduced to the lowest possible rank, that is, private. And you shall be obligated to do extra duty to the extent of 45 days. Dismissed. Dismissed. Aye, sir. Johnson. You know you got off easy. You want to explain to me how the hell San Diego TV got their hands on this? I called them before I came on base, sir. I felt like I had no choice. The Corps was gonna bury me, sir. The relationship between the Marine Corps and our host countries has to be honored. I couldn't do that to Meriam, sir. Make sure you get those chevrons off. Aye, sir. Two years of hard work down the tube, son. You think it was worth it? I'd do it again in a flash, sir.

I bet it's just about the size of your old bedroom. Yeah, but it's ours. Hey, there's no dishwasher. And I just learned how to use one. That's okay. There's no plates. [CHUCKLES] So what are we sleeping on? Trucker's coming over later with a mattress. Hey, Trucker's here? Yeah, he just got in. Of course, he outranks me now, but he's not being too disgusting about it. [CHUCKLING] Here, I got it. [BUGLE BLOWING] Double time. Hut! Jason. Remember our first date when you asked me what I believed in and I didn't know? I know now. This is what I believe in. Welcome home.
