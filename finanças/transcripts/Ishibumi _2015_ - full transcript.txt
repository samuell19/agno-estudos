Ishibumi. On August 6th 1945 the sun rose at 5:24 a.m it was already a hot summer's day the war was at its peak and life was tough with so little food to eat or goods to buy but Hiroshima was still a time-worn castle town and the days passed quietly. A 7th grader was running late for school but he lingered instead of getting ready to leave his worried mother finally got him out of the house but he immediately turned back savoring a drink of tap water he raced out again that was the last time his mother saw him alive many Hiroshima residents had previously emigrated to Hawaii and the US mainland and there were rumors that this was why our city hadn't been firebombed they also said this was why so many students from the heavily firebomb. Tokyo and Osaka were evacuated here had been evacuated from Tokyo into the Hiroshima middle school this is the letter his father wrote from Nagano after the war we had been living in Tokyo after my children lost their mother at an early age I had lost my older daughter to the firebombs in march and as the air raids worsened not wanting to lose my only son we moved to Hiroshima our hometown in June on August 6th the day the atomic bomb was dropped my son wanted to stay home because he had stepped on a nail working his student labor shift and his foot still hurt but I scolded him and sent him out of the house at 7:30. To live with his uncle on the outskirts of Hiroshima he wrote a letter to his father in Osaka soon after he transferred to his new school in Hiroshima he sent it special delivery on July 20th not long before he died I started my classes in Hiroshima middle school yesterday. I already made friends and we like studying together our teacher mr masuda is very kind with the enemy planes attacking you I doubt you can sleep well at night I already ate peaches and tomatoes and cucumbers and eggplants and beans and pumpkins. I even ate potatoes from the nursery they were delicious I don't have any textbooks so today I copy Chinese characters in my notebook I'm not the least bit lonely because I'm with my cousins tsuyoshi and nobuko so there's no need to worry about me because of the war there was a labor shortage and ninth graders on up were sent to work in the military factories leaving only 7th and 8th graders in school but even they had to grow potatoes in the fields so there were few days they actually studied that year there was no summer vacation that morning the 321 7th graders of Hiroshima middle school left their homes as early as 5:30 if they lived far away and 7:30 if they lived nearby at the same time the enola gay an American b-29 bomber carrying an atomic bomb was flying towards Hiroshima. Who evacuated from Tokyo left his home at 7:00. This is a passage from his mother's letter that day he said he wanted to stay home from school although usually he always wanted to go to school I told him you must be strong you're a boy while I washed the dishes in the kitchen but he had slipped out of the house. I had told him he must take the day off and go to the hospital for a thorough physical examination because he had been warned he needed one but after I left for work he told my wife I must do my patriotic duty and join the students working to clear fire breaks even if it's only to keep watch on their lunch boxes I'll go to the hospital on a day when there's no work and headed out meant preparing for firebombing by dismantling buildings to keep fires from spreading the authorities mobilized citizens to create open spaces throughout the city to contain fires and provide escape routes the 321 7th graders and their four teachers were told to gather in the center of Hiroshima on the hongkawa riverbank the road in front of the international conference center in the peace memorial park today they were told to meet at 8:10 to start work before it became too hot students from the Hiroshima girls high school the Hiroshima municipal shipbuilding technical high school and local volunteers had also been mobilized and were gathered near the 7th graders everyone was called to assembly from the 7th graders on up the Hiroshima middle school students lined up in twos in order of ascending classes on the eastern side of the shin ohashi bridge renamed the west peace bridge today the assembled students faced east with their backs to the hongkawa river in a position directly facing the b-29s approaching Hiroshima the anola gay and its two accompanying planes flew over the northeastern mountains towards their target the motoyasu bridge in the city center the assembled students had just finished their roll calls when they spied the glitter of the b-29 wing tips in the clear blue sky and began shouting enemy plane, is coming there're some students noticing the plane coming nearer.. Like Yamamoto and.. All turned around and looked up at the sky there had been no air raid siren and with only three bombers everyone assumed they were the usual reconnaissance planes they had no idea that a single bomb capable of taking 200 thousand lives had just been created the students were all staring up at the planes so some of them like morinaka takatoshi clearly saw the atomic bomb being dropped right after the lead b-29 dropped a black metallic drum the other planes dropped three objects tied to parachutes the anola gay dropped the atomic bomb three meters long with a diameter of 70 centimeters at 17 seconds past 8:15 a.m the planes behind it dropped wireless transceivers attached to parachutes to record the explosion 43 seconds later the atomic bomb exploded 570 meters above the atomic dome some 500 meters north east from the hongkawa riverbank where the students were assembled. Saw the force of the blast blow several classmates into the hongkawa river kosen hiroyuki remembers being surrounded by white smoke after a sudden huge noise and being buried with his classmates under the wreckage of nearby buildings and trees and bricks that flew at them many students heard the teacher minomura the river is your escape route jump into the river they leapt from the embankment three or four meters high into the hongkawa river at full tide right after the roll call I heard someone call retreat just when the bomb dropped I barely heard a voice cry jump into the river and I jumped into the hongkawa river as soon as the bomb exploded I saw people burned black later told his mother in that instant I glanced behind me and saw a brick wall collapse and many friends who couldn't escape disappeared in the cloud of dust okada akihisa recalls I was buried in dirt up to my hips but I came to and dug the burning sand and crawled out the heat of the atomic bomb even burned sand as soon as the bomb blasts students began screaming mommy daddy help me at the top of their lungs among them sakurabi ichiro calmed his classmates saying don't shout it will tire you out when his area caught fire he jumped into the river there is no way to know exactly how many of the 321 7th grade students survived the blast but looking at the letters from their surviving families it is estimated that one-third of the children died instantly. The fires that raged after the bomb blast drove the students into the river the 2000 school girls and volunteers jammed the covered alley of the riverboat docks by the shin ohashi bridge the river was the only means of escape the stone stairways leading down to the river were overwhelmed with severely burned people and some like masaki tadashi perished on the steps at 8:20 a.m the tide turned on the hongkawa river and the current began to flow swiftly some children were dragged downstream by the flow in the river severely burned children clung to planks and tree chunks and the piers of the shin ohashi bridge diving underwater to dodge the flames billowing from the riverbanks none of them knew the entire city had been instantly destroyed so they kept hoping help would arrive a large group of us survived by clinging to a tree that came down the river every time flames leapt at us from the shore we dove underwater we thought we were finished and sang the national anthem recalls those who couldn't swim said I'm going on ahead shouted bonsai and were swept away they all screamed mommy remembers we all help hands in the river and saying if I die at sea together was swept downstream and when his strength failed him he sank his body was found one kilometer downstream by the sumiyoshi bridge this is how his mother imagines he died after she found his body five days later on August 11th and asked his friends about him. He was badly burned in bobbing up and down in the river to escape the flames that blew from the shores a teacher told them you are all doing the work of soldiers let's sing if I die at sea the teacher and the students all sang together as he bobbed up and down in the river kenji lost his sight and the tree he was holding onto caught fire he gave up and sank I heard that after they sang if I die at sea they cheered for the emperor on August 6th low tide on the river was at 2:45 pm. The children struggled up the riverbed created by the ebbingtide and crawled over their dead friends bodies to reach higher ground. As the children reached higher ground a teacher told them if you can see you can go home but the city center is burning so you can go south towards ujina or cross the shin ohashi bridge and head west to escape described what happened when he reached higher ground. I floated in the river clinging to a piece of wood when I crawled up the riverbed the city was destroyed and I almost gave up but I persevered desperate to see my mother and father again when I crawled up to the riverbank my teacher pulled me up and told me your burns aren't so serious so hang in there and gave me strength my teacher and I made it up the riverbank together and as we searched for water to drink he said I'm not going to make it but you must stay strong and clasped my hand in farewell before I lost sight of him shimono yoshiki's mother told us the teacher's name was Yamamoto asahi toshiyaki was badly injured but started walking and was reunited with his father who was searching for him four kilometers away I made my way past fallen utility Poles and burning buildings to the yokogawa railway station I was desperate for a drink of water but when I tried to drink from a pump an old person warned me you'll die quickly if you drink the water so I didn't two days after asahi toshiyaki made it home his conditioned worsened he screamed all day get me a soldier's sword Japan will win I'm going to beat america because they killed all my friends he died at 9:45 a.m on August 9th and another boy was a good swimmer he jumped into the river and was swept downstream one kilometer he got up to the riverbank and walked south but there was no bridge so we got back into the river and swam a hundred meters across the river to reach our house in eba he was desperate for a drink of water his parents recall we nursed him through the night but he weakened the next morning and became unconscious by 10 am he passed away around noon firmly clasping our hands home in kami ten macho was only one kilometer from the epicenter of the blast and had been burned to the ground he stopped by the burned house and after resting in the air raid shelter in their yard headed to a house in yamatecho where he and his family had decided they would meet in an emergency when he reached the bridge on the yamate river he became exhausted and could go no further around five o'clock he called out to a passing friend who carried him on his back to the meeting place but his face was so bloated with burns that his friend could only recognize him from his name tag after that he could barely speak and passed away at six o'clock on the morning of August. I crossed three railroad Bridges and I was so scared he remembers in koi someone was shouting anyone heading home to otake from here he gave me a ride on his truck and I made it home in the early evening his mother tried to cut off his white short sleeve shirt to remove it but he said don't waste the shirt as the children made their way out of the city many children's parents came into the burning city looking for them it was about this time when people began realizing that a single bomb had demolished the entire city. Who had seen the atomic bomb drop crawled up from the river in the early afternoon and collapsed on the riverbank his father made his way through the roaring flames and found him there at 1:30. His father recalls one of the students who are all burned black was calling out for his father I was only able to recognize my own son when I saw his laced boots crying with happiness I carried my son on my back we walked two and a half kilometers south along the railroad tracks for an hour and a half in the awful heat and made it home as the eastern sky began to lighten at five o'clock the next morning he took his last breath that night between enemy plane attacks we cremated him outdoors Yamada tatsuji collapsed on the riverbank and called out to people headed west to tell his family who lived in furuta machi takasu when no one came to his rescue he could wait no longer and started walking but after 500 meters he collapsed by the train station about that time his mother a teacher at the funairi national school who had injured her leg in the atomic blast had made it home during the war elementary schools were called national schools she recalls around one o'clock I heard from his classmate's father that he was in a burned rail car in dobashi the city was still on fire and it was dangerous but there was no one to help me so I dragged my aching leg and reached dobashi around three o'clock the three-wheeled cart I'd asked to follow me never arrived so I cradled my son in the burned rail car all night I went home the next morning to get the cart and was finally able to bring him home he was desperate for a drink of water and said he would eat the food I had brought for him at home after that he became delirious and kept muttering pull this push that as though he was still working and took his last breath at 2:30 on August 9th. Who later heard what happened to him inside the truck wrote down what she heard my son had no idea what had happened to the city and in the truck he was so thirsty he said please buy me an ice candy I have five cents I have 10 cents when he reached the school he said I only have 70 or 80 cents of my allowance but when my mother comes she will give me more. Was blinded but he somehow felt his way two kilometers to the west reaching koi though he couldn't see when he felt someone passing him he shouted my home is in kusatsu please someone take me home later that afternoon a teacher mr minomura dismissed the students around him and set off for the middle school 1.5 kilometers away with the students who could walk some 20 students took off with their teacher the soaring poplar trees in the schoolyard had survived but the schoolhouse had burned down no one knows how many reached the school how many collapsed along the way around 7:30 pm after reaching a colleague's home near the school the teacher passed away utterly. Nightfall on August 6th by 8:30 kodama yasunori's father made his way to the western riverbank from his evacuation site in hatskai chichou I was calling out my son's name near the shin ohashi bridge when he raised his hand I left the other thirsty students in the care of the soldiers and carried him on my back to the Hiroshima red cross hospital we were told they could transport him to the first aid station on ninoshima island if we waited two hours but the doctor said it's only a matter of time stay by his side I carried him back to ujina on my back around nine o'clock that night tashima noriaki guided by strangers made his way back to his home in the eastern suburbs I don't know how I made my way but I got past the fires raging in the center of the city and collapsed by the tsurumibashi bridge at the foot of mount hiji people from kaitaichi rescued him and drove him home on a truck but he passed away the next day at noon as he lay dying he called his friends names murmuring follow me and I'll help you follow me made it back to his home which was 24 kilometers away his parents recall he was soaking wet from the river and the rain and burned so badly we couldn't take off his clothes we cut them away with scissors as soon as he got home he said I lost my commuter train pass and then I think our teacher was crushed to death shimono lay on the riverbank hanging on to life desperate to see his father and mother at 9:40 that night he heard his father's voice I was screaming my son's name when he raised his hand calling daddy joyously after I walked him home two kilometers to minami kannan he. He also said I'm just one of the soldiers and begged us to sing his favorite song that night someone brought home gendo yoshiaki who also lived in minami kannon the soldiers who found him offered repeatedly to take him to the rescue station on ninoshima island but he refused saying I have to get home to my mother he cheerily told me that a kind woman he didn't know had put ointment on the burns on his chest and back and fed him canned oranges he passed away on August 7th at 11 am made it home badly burned and heard that his younger brother hadn't made it home yet he rushed right back out again his mother followed and they raced along the train tracks to the hongkawa riverbank the middle school students were laid out in a row not moving we found him by screaming his name and peering at their faces his whole body was severely burned your mother came for you, see? Your brother came for you, too. Let's go home now. All he could do was murmuring, he brother carried him on his back. Maybe he dreamed he was still on the student labor crew. he murmured the next morning he barely hummed the words to if I die at sea as his 12 year old life came to an end in all that chaos we cremated him in our garden it was well past midnight when wakisaka kunio's father made it to the eastern end of shinohashi bridge when I called out his name he responded daddy but his face was so disfigured by burns I couldn't recognize him I always knew you'd come for me daddy he said. I loaded him onto my bicycle cart and made our way home 16 kilometers through the dark night he died at 2:30 the next afternoon father heard that something terrible had happened to Hiroshima and left his house at noon after walking 10 kilometers he entered the city which was still roaring with flames. I found my son where he'd been working his face was so swollen with burns that I only recognized him from the name tag on his chest the skin on his arms and legs was hanging off him so I wrapped his gators behind his legs and carried him on my back to the edge of the city we got a ride home on a passing truck but he died at four in the morning on August 7th some students immobilized by their wounds or whose homes were located in still burning flames huddled on the riverbanks many of them went missing as they collapsed on their way home military trucks carried others to first aid stations around the city one first aid station was set up in the xinji temple the priest's son was a 7th grader so many of his fellow students made their way to the temple had his burns treated with a white ointment and reached his nearby home at six o'clock that evening he said. For he called out his friends names saying hold on and I want a huge drink of water to bear the pain he counted out numbers and called out his friends names and passed away at 7:30 that night he never complained about his agony the other seven students who made it to the temple were kept there after receiving first aid but none of them were reunited with their parents before they passed away their parents heard their stories from the priest and other caretakers when they finally located their bodies reached the temple first with three other students who came to tell the priest that his son had collapsed along the way died at 9:30 that night but by the time his mother finally found him on August 15th he had been cremated. I was told that the people at the temple gave him water that night lying with his fellow students he sang the national anthem saluted bonsai to the emperor then. I saw his name posted on the temple gate and collected his remains two hours later Japan announced it had lost and the war was over nakagawa who had left his home on the morning of August 6th after enjoying a drink of water straggled to the temple with his classmate his mother visited the temple the next afternoon but masashi had already passed away that morning they told me he kept going to the temple well to drink water but his hands were burned so badly he couldn't hold the bucket someone from the temple gave him water from a bottle and he passed away reached the temple on the morning of August 8th he had already died his mother wrote we heard that among the many students crying out their parents names our son said I'll see my father and mother in my dreams his father came home after hearing this and spent the night weeping for his beloved son who had resigned himself to his fate when we received his remains the school book my son had carried in a satchel wrapped around his waist was still wet from being in the river his father's hair fell out from the radiation sickness and he died on August 27th there was a dormitory for students from the suburbs near the Hiroshima middle school house where only the two poplar trees had survived the bomb the school house was damaged but was spared the fires and a rescue center was set up inside on the evening of August 6th the dormitory Dean found three 7th graders collapsed on the school grounds one of them nakaishi yoshiharu was barely breathing and passed away after being given a drink of water after his classmates were carried into the dormitory he was cremated in the shade of the poplar tree he had played beside his father who reached the school on August 9th from the island where they lived took home his remains after matsui noboru climbed out of the river a passerby informed the school and an older student rode his bike to bring him to the dormitory after he came home that afternoon his elementary school classmates came to his bedside they talked among themselves eating oranges when his friends left around three o'clock he called out. He waved his arms calling out advance advance attack and then calling mother and aunt with his last breath. Was able to see his older brother a student at a nearby school who came to the dormitory to find him before he was taken to hedda village seeing his brother's grievous condition his older brother walked 50 kilometers through the night to tell their mother learning of his condition his mother and older sister walked back to heda village on the morning of August 9th but he had died the previous morning. I heard that he was in agony for three days shouting shoot down the b-29s victory to Japan and finally "mother" before he passed away the last time I saw my healthy son was when he came home once after moving into the dormitory. I will always remember him as he left home looking gallant in his military issue cap and gators carrying a bottle of pickled plums to take to the dormitory smiling as he called out off I go inside his children's desk in the dormitory I found an envelope he had addressed to me containing his report card. Hiroshima burned the father of kubota hideki the transfer student from Tokyo reached the shin ohashi bridge around seven o'clock that night he searched the area for his only remaining child [music] All of the students in the burned out rubble were severely injured when I asked one of them who was leaning against a smoldering telephone pole if he had seen my son he told me I think I saw him at the back when we were all lined up but I fell during the air raid so I don't know what happened after that. I kept searching the city every day but I never found him later I came across a work crew clearing the shin ohashi bridge and found his bloodied wrapping cloth for his lunchbox I've always cherished it to remember him by I searched for my son in so many refugee areas where I saw so many helpless children calling out their parents names and crying out to the soldiers to help them I have lived all these years consoling myself that I never found his remains because he's still alive somewhere that night around eight o'clock taniguchi isao's father walked in the pitch dark from koi to the shin ohashi bridge screaming his son's name, isaw's older brother was with him too. - You found your brother around here. - Yes, just over there, I think. - Let's walk on then. - Please tell me what happened. - You and your father searched far and wide. - Yes, that's right. The day after Hiroshima was destroyed there were still many Hiroshima middle school 7th graders on the hongkawa riverbank but very few of them were still alive the records tell us that after the morning of August 7th only two students who made it to the riverbank saw their parents before they died one of them his father set off by boat from his island home on the morning of August 7th up the honkawa river. I was able to find him by the shin ohashi bridge because I had always told him to wait for me at school or his work area in case he was injured in an air raid he was so horribly burned that I could only recognize him from his name tag. It was so cold at night I drink water from the river but this salt water tastes much better he died at one o'clock in the morning. At the time his father was an officer in the army as chief of staff in the army marine corps I worked without rest or sleep to rescue others and despite my concern for my child my search for him was delayed he had been abandoned for two days and nights when one of my men finally found him and brought him home he died at noon on August 10th seeing his things would have tormented me so much. Who walked the 26 kilometers from neighboring kude city through the night found her son on the riverbank at 5 am just after he had passed away when I found him dead my eldest son's face was burned red and swollen his fingers hideously burned he must have passed away just before I arrived the tears on his cheeks were still wet and glinting in the morning sun when I reached the riverbank five students were still alive but four students died before my eyes a soldier loaded one other student onto a stretcher and took him away the riverbank was filled with the ceaseless sobbing of parents searching for their children's remains. Father arrived around 8 o'clock that morning. And I had reached the middle of the shin ohashi bridge when I looked back and saw four or five mothers huddled together talking I got worried and turned back the mothers were staring at one student among many badly burned students whose clothes were charred and ripped to shreds he was a 7th grader lying face down dead in the shallows his military cap and uniform intact his face resting on a clog his shoes looked just like my sons and I made my way through the corpses apologizing to each of them when I lifted him up I saw the name tag taita and realized it was my son he probably intended to jump into the river right after the explosion but by then there were so many people on the riverbank he must have laid down in the shallows to wait for help. Were found at ten o'clock that morning they were cremated on the riverbank that day the Hiroshima air defense headquarters had ordered the soldiers and volunteers searching for people to rescue to cremate all the bodies of the dead by August 9th Many bodies were also gathered near the shin ohashi bridge and cremated together the families of 13 students collected their remains there the remains of nakagawa masahiro who had evacuated from Kobe were also never found his father was severely injured so only his mother could search for him although she cared for many students on the Hong kawa riverbanks she was never able to locate her own son the parents of the 7th graders who could not find their children searched among the shoes and lunch boxes and burned caps and clothes left behind on the riverbank and took home their children's belongings although many of the students who died were identified approximately half of the 321 middle school 7th graders were never found in other words they remained missing although it was believed that none of the 7th graders had survived but later discovered that several did survived. The students' fathers and mothers search for them desperately in first aid stations and temporary morgues all over the city and atomic bomb had suspended life but the war continued people said that white clothes warded off the rays of the new bomb so many people dressed in white whenever an enemy plane presumably for reconnaissance flew overhead people raced to bomb shelters and hid behind anything they could find meanwhile the students who had made it home alive were gradually dying died in his home in hatsukaichi his mother by his side at 7:25 on the morning of August 7th he was still conscious calling out to his grandmother talking to his uncle and aunt and clasping his little sister's hand everyone crowded around his bed. I tried to calm him saying you can tell us more tomorrow sleep well tonight but he said I slept plenty in the river this afternoon so I'm fine I was grateful that he didn't seem to be in much pain if we had known he would die so soon we would have stayed up all night listening to his story. Had been taken to the hot skyichi national school his family found him on August 7th and crossed Hiroshima bay by boat to take him home in the aki district we finally found a boat and brought him on board but he took his last breath around noon just offshore from kudai city he said when I get better I'll get my revenge and passed away who was distressed at having lost his train pass also passed away by his mother's side in those days people believed it wasn't good to let injured people drink water but he was so badly wounded that I knew he couldn't survive so I gave him as much water as he wanted he finally died on the night of August 8th while the eastern city of fukuyama was being firebombed the light was dim because of the mandatory blackout when he cried out mother mother and took. Who didn't want his mother to waste his white shirt by cutting it off died at dawn on August 9th cared for by his mother as meiji lay dying he said his farewells to his younger brother and his younger sister when I asked him what shall I tell your grandfather in kagoshima he said to tell him I was brave but he said to me no you should join me later at the time I was beside myself with grief but thinking back on what he said I realize that what he said was profound father and mother brought him home from the first aid station he died at 8:10 on the morning of August 11th. After living 13 years and 5 days he asked his father to sing his favorite military song and died listening to the song August 6th had been his birthday. If you ever visit Hiroshima please stop by the Hiroshima middle school memorial on the hongkawa riverbank in the peace memorial park the names of all the students from Hiroshima middle school are carved in stone on the memorial that gazes out over the unchanging flow of the hangkawa river.
