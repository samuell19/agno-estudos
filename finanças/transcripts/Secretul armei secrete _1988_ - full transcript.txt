ROMANIA FILM presents A 4TH FILM STUDIO BUCHAREST PRODUCTION Inhabitants of the city, it's 4 o'clock. Silence and peace are ruling. Pictures! Pictures! Who is this? With such useless spies, no wonder that everyone is crossing the line with us. This is the hale and hearty Brave. A very dangerous foe. Has he declared war against us? No, that's precisely why he is so dangerous. He is trying to baffle all our military plans, right at this very moment, when the secret weapon invented by our king is ready. Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Forget about this childish enthusiasm. Who is this? - You are fired. - But I didn' say anything. But you'll say and it's going to be a stupid thing. This is the dragonish dragon, the bravest of all. He is a very dangerous aggressor that would do anything to discover the secret of the secret weapon and to use it against us. - Get him! Get him! - Don't leave me here! THE SECRET... OF THE SECRET WEAPON! an Alexandru Tatos film with Let them catch us, Let them catch us If they know how to Or if they're able to... I break the lake's frozen mirror And right after you I run. Everyone shall meet my anger Changing faces all the time. If they wouldn't admit it, I am forced to admit you. So we are bound by faith, Sharing a harsh destiny. There is no art in running. In dying even less. Thru war and evil deeds I shall crush them every day. Look, I cannot comprehend The passion for distruction. Thru fight we shall unbind ourselves. One of us must die. My body, my mind wants peace. Forget about your mind. I want war. From now on, no ill omen songs Shall be heard. - It shall be peace in the world. - It shall not. You'll see. The cannon, the soldier, the gendarme. The cannon, the soldier... the gardener. Oh, my little one! My God! My God! Step away! The gendarme is the man who guards the palace. You look familiar... Where do I know you from? I'm your highness gardener. Oh yes, of course. When you start to suspect things, you end up going insane... Pay attention! You... there... Gendarme... - You resemble this one. - I don't think so. - Well, I tell you so. - No way. I give you my word. Lucky you, you don't resemble to the other one. Wow, he's so ugly! I understand that you backbite me. Even more, I posted your photo. Vulgar advertising! But what am I, a pop singer? I am the Dragonish Dragon! I am the Dragonish Dragon! Don't shout, I know what you are. It looks like the king hasn't found it out yet. But why does he want to destroy you then? He says he's got a secret weapon with which he wants to knock you down and conquer the world. Such a crazy dream! I am more humble. I don't intend to conquer the world - that is unlike to happen - but to destroy it - which is possible. Do you know the secret of the secret weapon, dear? How should I know it, if it's secret? A secret... We'll reveal it, dear cousin, 'cause that's why secrets exist: to be revealed. Maybe I'll pay a visit to our friend. All entrances are thoroughly guarded. - You know what, dear cousin? - Mm... I'll do something I've never done before. - What? - I'll think. Really! Dear cousin, I'll show the world that the Dragonish Dragon can make the best of his mind if he intends to. Wow! Did you see that? Failure! Boom! Your Majesty, your Serene Highness... What is it, your Great Council? Have you come to congratulate me? It was divine, magnificent... ... an explosion like no other before. You are stupid, Little Council. The experience was sub-mediocre. I only blew up one house, so it doesn't worth a dime. But it does, 11.760 quids and 50 gold coins. - How do you know that? - It used to be my girlfriend's house. No problem, you'll build another one for her. It's not possible any more. She was inside the house. Even better! You avoided spending some money. Look what's bothering him now, when we have a war to start. That's him, never interested but in his own trivial issues. Ay, a mouse! Fantastic, Your Majesty, unbelievable! How can you possibly do such a thing, Your Majesty? Oh, it makes you dream away... All right, go on, dream on... Leave me alone! The... Secret... Weapon...! The Secret Weapon! - I'd better double the composition. - Of course, Your Serene Highness. - Or better change the fuse caliber. - That's better, Your Serene Highness... - Or both. - That's even better, Your Serene Highness. Can you be so nice to... Yes, you look better from behind. You kind of walk on my nerves, you know... Dad, I cannot tolerate this. I have nothing to wear. All my clothes are too small. My girl... I haven't seen you since... Since you were 3. I promised you a fireworks show. Come by the window, my dear. I'll show you a huge fireworks show. I think I found a convenient target. Look, here! My house is right in the middle, Your Highness. It's the most convenient! What a man does to himself is well done. Press here! Three from a single shot! It's a remarkable progress. Did you like it? It would have been better to give me those money. Look! Get down! How many times do I have to tell you not to climb the chair? But since you are so big... That's love at first sight. My daughter, you should get married. Put something on, don't just stand naked there! Squeak! Squeak! That's love at first sight. I should have disguised myself as a cat. - Who's been smoking? - No one. - Who could dare to, Your Majesty? - But where's the smoke coming from? We are thinking, Your Majesty... ... to whom we may fight with. All the neighbouring countries have been occupied. Your kingdom's borders have reached the sea. My colleague gives out an interesting idea, as usual. To fight against the sea... Caligula shall try this too, ... without any good results. There is also the risk to get wet. You're right. Why make today the mistake we can make tomorrow? We screwed up. Think! If you must think, then think. Come on, think! I have some loathsome feeling, Anxiety is torturing me, Am I such pathetic fooly, Or the Beauty has bewitched me? What was that? What if we're being spied on? No wonder, given the amateurism our Great Council displays. Shoo shoo, unworthy crow! Go to hell! They released the crows! Have you got any ideas? Poor me, I have to find the solution myself. Always me! Did you forget that my daughter has to be wedded? - Are we planning a wedding or a war? - Both, you stupid. Wherever there's a party, there's a fight also. We break the news to the world: The Beauty's looking for a groom. The candidates shall come in crowds. She only gets to chose one, so the others shall challenge us to fight. But where is the challenge? We'll pretend to be offended that they didn't marry her. I swear right here, by the Emperor's window, that The Beauty shall be mine. We spread the news in all four corners of the world, admitting that the Earth is square, that, during the last Sunday of this month, the beautiful Lady shall choose a groom for herself. The contest shall be held at the Imperial Court and is followed by dance and tombola. Our primary evaluation shows that this Court is a very rich one, so you are advised to get married to the Emperor's daughter. Just an example... The quantity of chlorophyll... I'm hungry. How long 'till the lunch? One hour sharp, Your Excellency. Oh, how the time flows... Serve the lunch! Some more, some more, some more, Some soup, some steak, some cake. My belly, my belly is sore Because of this royal intake. Some soup, some steak, some cake. My belly, my belly is sore. What's that noise over there? Hey you, what are you doing here? What? This question would be legitimate only addressed by me! Since when the intruder asks the master what's he doing in his own home? You are wrong, buddy. All my stupid eyes can see is owned by no other than my master, the great Emperor Dry Throat. Because you are so unbelievable stupid, have a little gift from me. Here! - Thank you. - Don't hit me! - Pardon me! - My little baby... Drink, drink, let's drink it all, Lace waterfalls flowing down You can almost hear them call, You get thirsty on your own Keep on drinking... ... never stop. Well, stop! I'd rather skip the protocole and get straight to the party. Dear competitor, instead of hating each other, wouldn't be better to party? You're damn right! Honorable emperors like ourselves should leave the battle to the troops and initiate a top-level talk. Yes, I... You... Some alcohol for... What are you doing here? Smash the enemy! And you? What are you waiting for? - Fight until the last man dies. - Go on! Brother Belly, I'd like to tell you something. Speak up! But I am embarrassed. Go on, a blue joke goes well with a drink. Brother Belly, let's fraternize and forget the centuries of insults, let us cooperate... Brother Throat, to establish a never ending peace, let's marry the Emperor's daughter... Both of us. Do you find it appropriate? Don't you think people will talk? Our purpose is not an erotic, but strategic one. Think about it! If we put together my kingdom, your kingdom and what land we can grab from the Emperor, we shall be the rulers of the world! Do you really want us to rule the entire world? Wouldn't it be better to party? If we don't rule it, someone else has to. All right, it's just that... All right! 15 points for the Viking Emperor! Next, His Highness, The Carrot, The Emperor of Leaves. His Highness, the Carrot, has been penalized by 15 points. Next, the second attempt. Thank you. Let's see who's this... That's it! What else? This one. Another one? I like this boy. He's got nerve. He is the son in law I need. Go on, boy, kill them all! Try to distract him while we break into Emperor's lab. I saw you! Easy boy, daddy'll help you! It's so nice! Take it, if you like it. Sleep well, boy. 25 points for His Highness, The Carrot, who is now on the first place. Next, the most important test, reciting. The points obtained here are doubled. What is this reciting thing? You have to tell lyrics by heart. The first competitor is The Carrots, The Emperor of Leaves. "Beautiful one..." This Parsley shall gain a lot of points for reciting. What shall we do about him? "Beautiful one, in my loving sight You shine like a sunny light." That's it, over here... "Beautiful one, in my loving sight You seem so flowerly bright." - Have a nice trip! - Thank you. Is he giving up? I cannot believe it, he almost won the contest! Next, His Highness Green Belly, The King of Cans. - Why are you following me? - I thought we were allies. What's with them? They must have signed up in the team section. "Beautiful one, to my slender taste Your funny look," "It's long way beyond A sausage on a hook." "I find it even better And so deeply fine," "That I could prefer it To a good old wine." "And a good fried chicken It's better to dine" "Than all that old barrels That pour out their wine." - No, it isn't. - Yes, it is. - It is not! - Yes, it is. Idiots! You idiots! Green Belly and Dry Throat have been eliminated from the race. What does that mean, gentlemen? It's unbelievable! We are forced to call the Fire Department. I repeat the call! Please, leave the stage! Yes, he is the hale and hearty Brave. Get him! She is so beautiful! "If you had a soul As you have of sweetness" "You would feel my song My beloved princess." "I owe my life to the great king My love to see, but than again" "It seems so far and tiny thing That all I get is a sharp pain." "I dream awake while still far Lost in the blue and dirty haze" "To heal my heavy soul I pray My princess, with your loving blaze." Who is the young fellow? Your Highness' gardener, a nice young man. My Highness' gardener? How dares he? I want him to be my groom and no one else but him! He was not in the competition. It's not fair! He is the hale and hearty Brave. Arrest him! No! If something bad happens to him, I kill myself. - Arrest him! - No! - Yes! - No! - Yes, arrest him! - No! Shut up! Who is The Emperor here, me or you? Arrest him! No... - Have him drowned immediately! - Immediately or immersed in water? In water immersed he'll be and immediately relegated you are. Your Great Council shall be little, like a midget in a kettle. Drown him into the water! - Let the Brave die! - Let him perish! "Beautiful one, in my loving sight..." Let the Brave perish... Let the Brave perish We do not need him here. "You shine like a sunny light." We can live by our own strength We can live without the Brave. "Your world admired beauty is divine I my love-filled heart it'll never decline." Let the Brave perish. "Beautiful one, in my loving sight You shine like a sunny light." One... Two... Three. It's time. Drink! Look who's here! No fuss, no buzz, follow me quietly. Come on! Do you thing this is a joke? Dear ones, I love you all and I'd like you all to be my sons in law. But, since it's impossible... Who is there? Be good if you care about this innocent life. Step aside, for I have not enough room to take off. Step aside! Help! Help! - He was in our hands! - Yes, but we would lose an opponent. War! ! ! There is a reason for a war. Brothers, follow me in this bloody war in which the Secret Weapon should be used. The bravest of you shall get the girl and the rest of you, a part of the Dragon's possessions. For the next contest, the reciting test shall be eliminated. We shall all go on and fight The Dragon shall be beaten all right No matter who stands on our sight, The world is not enough for us The Dragon knows, the Dragon knows We want to rule on all the lands 'Cause that's the Dragon wants. Let's see who's tougher Get to war, get to war Let's see who'll suffer Get to war, get to war. Get to war, get to war... What a wonderful creature! I dream of being awake... You are awake, dear Brave. What am I doing here? - I had a terrible nightmare. - Everything happened for real. - Am I on the other side? - I saved you. I owed you one. Finally, the time has come To say thank you from my heart You were once the bravest one And you saved me from the start. I used to be a little bee An awful bumble bee My eyes could see. A dragon he resembled And he could kill me For a second I trembled But you came and saved me. Here is a little flute. When you're in trouble, blow it and I'll help you and protect you. If you don't have the right connections, you're worthless. Thank you, merciful and gorgeous fairy. I have to stop the war and look for my soul mate. Have a safe trip! Good bye! We seemed to be doomed By the road to lie Locked up, no guilt assumed No rest, no light... We die. In the Dragon's cellar we're imprisoned. Right in the assassin's claws... You'd like a husband like myself, be honest. No way! It doesn't matter, the point is I'd like a wife like yourself. If you say so... You mean you don't want to be my wife? Of course not. I love you... ... and I want to make you the ruler of the world. I couldn't care less. I'll buy you everything you want, jewellery, fur coats, everything... I want a handsome man, you ugly! Ugly or not, like it or not, you're going to be my wife. - I love you! - Leave me alone! I love you! Who would have thought that such a delicate little hand... Has it swollen? Not as much as I would have liked to. I love you! If you don't come to your senses, I'll kill myself. - Get out of my room. - Right away. Who taught you to barge into a woman? - I'll go. - I kill myself. It has a sheath... We shall all go on and fight The Dragon shall be beaten all right... "In my loving sight you shine like..." Like a sunny light, right? No matter who stands on our sight. "Beautiful one, in my loving sight You shine like a sunny light." It's going to be such a good match! The castle's yard is so wide, so the kingdom must be huge. Went to battle in the morn' To the war, straight ahead But now we are feeling torn Sick and tired, weary dead Long and winding is the road The shape we're in is quite a shame We're getting tired of this load Too long the way, too deep the pain We are not eager anymore Left-right, left-right... We are not eager anymore Left-right, left-right... A sudden war. "Kingdom of the Dragonish Dragon." "No honking." One can suffer out of love But when the love is true When I open my heart's door I feel a pain, my livers is like glue I lie down like a carpet on the floor Morning seems evening to me A dog in heat I feel to be. What's going on, cousin? Why are you so upset? - I'm not, it's your imagination. - You can't fool me. - What did she do? - She doesn't want me. - Not at all? - Not a single bit. Pack up her stuff and send her back to her father. Never! - You're in love, poor fool! - I'm afraid so... You're good for nothing. Look at yourself! Who'd say you've been a real world menace once! I can't understand how one can be in love. Love is a baleful human feeling, it's a germ. What are you going to do, start to work for charity? - No way. - What then? That's how people become losers! I slept so well! It's so beautiful here! After this war is over, I'll go to the seaside for a few day and get a nice tan. - What resort is that? - Oops! "Kingdom of the Dragonish Dragon." Did you get scared? Why? Have you forgotten that we have a holy war to fight? Holy or bloody? Holy, simply because it's going to be bloody. The bloodier the war, the holier its cause becomes. Why don't you write this down? It's my contribution to the theory of warfare. History shall need it in order to justify its horrors. Look, that's interesting. So, the Dragon resides in the basement. I'm going to do him in even if he lives in the attic. You mean we have to follow him underground? No. What are we going to do, some digging maybe? We're going to use a propriety you completely lack: intelligence and culture. When it comes to tricks, history teaches us a lot. Cousin, look this creature that got a place here. - Wow, what a duck! - It could be enough for a month. Where shall we get enough cabbage from? I'm going to eat you, my sweet chubby duck. Cousin, we're going to leave it here. Otherwise the home-staying ones shall feel bad. What a distinguished handsome man! What a beauty! Go away, temptation! Go away, temptation! What a perfect education! We are ready. Can we start the battle? Let's start. - What shall we start with? - The secret weapon, of course. - Why waste time? - What about the army? What did you gather all those forces for? For them to die like bravees. Fire! Stay out of this! Fire! He killed me! - It fires backwards, My Lord. - Sure, that's the secret. To confuse the enemy, the shell goes round the globe and when they less expect it, boom! It hits them from behind. But it first hits our men, My Lord. Why don't they step aside? Fire! We're being attacked! Get up, you idiot, we are being attacked. God damn your duck! If we learned when we were supposed to... - They are using the secret weapon. - What? Luckily, we also have this hellish weapon. Fire! Such a terrible weapon! We didn’t even come to used and it already destroyed half of our enemy's forces. I'm going to complete my work. Fire when I tell you to. Fire, can't you hear me? It started to be effective. Fire! 2305, 2306, 2307... It goes very well. Have you lost your mind? Can't you see this cannon fires backwards? Why do you tell me that for? The king invented it, not me. - We are going to destroy ourselves. - That's the war. Fire! But not my household. Get inside! Fire! Fire! Fire! I don't understand. I fired with the greatest precision. We lost one battle, but not the war. We get back home and start again. The King and the Dragon killed each other, so it's high time we ruled the world. It's so nice our here, you can feel the sea breeze... The wine is so good... Such a nice little wild creature! There are women at the party... Girl, don't you want to drink with us? Bro Throat, you're very drunk and frustrated if you mistake a bush for a woman. - It was a woman, I bet my life on it! - It was, like hell! It is a woman! It is a woman! - It was a woman... - Go to hell! Excuse us, where can we pick some wild thyme from? Come with me. What are you doing here, at the seaside? I live. - Just like that, under the stars? - Of course, when the sky is clear. What do you do when it's cloudy? Do you wear your nice coat proudly? You're getting on my nerves with your poetry. Words pay no debts. I like you and if you want to get lucky you must make love to me. Stay in line, you amateur! This way! We don't wait in line, it's all about the chemistry. That's betrayal. Since you like girls, I'm going to hire you as housewives. My housekeeper has left. If you knew at least how to embrace a woman! I wander thru the woods Never ending like my love. Where are you, my Beauty? Wherever you are, I'll find you I'll look for you night and day. I'll carry out the wonder Even the world to cross I must Of you I every day shall ponder From Dragon I must steal you fast. Where are you, my Beauty? - What is this, a motel? - This one is dead, dear. - Since when the dead can walk? - The Beauty... I saw with my own eyes when they drowned him. He's dead and still naughty. Kill him again! He must not find the Beauty. Brave! This boy can really embrace a woman. What did the cousin say, that he was dead? Let get out of here. I haven't forgotten that I must fight with the Dragon. You'll have plenty of time later. A Brave never postpones his duties. Protect yourself from the Dragon. He's got all sort of weapons, some are secret, others patented. I also have two weapons that can make wonders. - Which ones? - The love you grew in me. Dear, if you really love me, let's leave for a safer place. Come on! No, I can defeat both dragons and lightning rods with this little flaut. It's so nice! Give it to me. No, The Lake Fairy told me not to give it away. - Not even to me? - Nope. Please! I'll give you a kiss. Please please. I made you go back to your small human size! You refused my offer. You have no idea how much you lost. I'll punish you to be burried alive. Lake Fairy! Too bad! I could have liked that boy. It's the first time I actually like someone. Such a tragic syncopation. We ended up so badly, Bro Throat... Once a gentle gentleman I did nothing but mistakes. Now I clean the yard with brooms, Do the dishes and bake cakes. It's so risky, oh so risky Getting married in a rush Leaving all, behaving frisky Giving up your living posh. You're inconsolable as a groom And you're taken for a fool. It's so risky, oh so risky Getting married in a rush. It's not clean enough. Give it another brooming. Brave. Please, show yourself, Brave. Merciful Fairy, forgive me. I was careless and a woman stole my flaut. Forest Monster! I think it was her! What a chick! Take care, don't lose this flaut too. I don't have unlimited quantities. How can I replay the good you did to me? By listening to my sad story. I'm gonna sing it again for you. Finally, the time has come To say thank you from my heart You were once the bravest one And you saved me from the start. Oh, my dear Brave, why did I kill you? How can I regret it? Isn't love a human weakness? Oh, oh, oh... Oh, oh, my heart turned into stone. Like a tired warrior Was dismissed by its superior. Oh, my heart turned into stone With my love it has gone. What a curse! It's a scare like no other. The Brave is my lover. Oh, oh, oh... - Brave, where are you? - Here. Who is calling me? He has risen from the dead! The faith heard my prayers and decided he'd be mine, even if I have to go against my cousin's benefit. I always hear my lover's voice. Perhaps she's calling me in her thoughts. Beauty! - Who is calling me? - Me, the Brave. I'm so happy! Save me, Brave. But you were drowned to death. How did you get here? I made my way around... Sing to me! If I recognize your voice, I'll open the door for you. Yes... yes... I wander thru the woods Never ending like my love. Where are you, my Beauty? Son of a gun my cousin! She helps me when I'm in need. It's enough, my dear. No need to sing any more. - But I didn't even start to sing! - I think I'm dreaming. I feel like hovering... My dear, how much I missed you! I thought you were dead. - Beauty... - But you are alive. - Beauty, I am here. - I'm hovering... - Why? - I was deceived. But who are you and what are you doing here? What do you mean? Beauty, I am the Brave! - If you don't leave, I'll jostle you. - It's me, the Brave. - What Brave? No Brave... - It's me, the Brave! Look at me! Am I a Dragon or a tenter-hook in this house? Earth creatures are wandering thru my house... Step aside, you're driving me crazy! - Who are you looking for? - You, Dragon, just you. Me? What a mess! My cousin is going to kill him. Very nice to meet you. What is it with you? Are you all right? I thought I broke your arm. Good... Did he break it? It was a joke. - Wait! - Why? Where are you, Earth creature? I got it, there's many of you! Go Brave, go! Up! Are you sure? Go Brave, go! Wait... ... let me push these walls a little. - How do you intend to push them? - With my hands. - Like this? - Yup. Piu, piu, piu... Piu, piu, piu... Did you like it? You liked it! Do the same to me if you can. Don't you do this again. I forgive you this time. Please stop me! He almost destroyed me. He's very strong and has a huge chest. For an Earth creature, he's very... That's him. I kind of like you. I forgive you and invite you to dinner. Pour the wine, the party started, Life is very sweet. Sweeter is when war developped 'Cause you end up dead meat. Sip the good wine all at once Feel like sleeping in your pants In a cannon ball you sleep Still feel like another sip. Friend, I hope you realize that I can destroy the Earth if I want to. - But do you know this one? - Don't be an ass! Asshole! À la guerre comme à la guerre! Keep on pouring the good wine During war, the party's fine. He'll soon be drop dead drunk. - Try to steal some of their clothes. - No! We'll try to escape tonight. We'll take the Beauty with us. I'll try to get the keys. Go! I care about you. I can tell you that first of all... ... I'm going to destroy all the museums and all the libraries. Do you know how it feels to be the strongest person in the world? - Do you know how it feels to be in love? - Why are you asking me that? When you're in love The world to be at peace you'd like to With every word and every move. The war makes earth-grown love to Destroy itself and perish like a dove. Maybe wars would end If love is cherished on this land. I never believed in songs, but this one sounds so true... Good for you! I like you... ... and I started to care about you, so I'd like us to become relatives. - I allow you to marry my cousin. - No... She's quite a woman. Show yourself! - Show yourself, darling. - No. Show yourself... ... a little. You cannot compare her with that ugly Beauty. What a party we'll have! Perform a pirouette! If you want her, you can have her. Maybe our friend is a little tired. You should go on tomorrow... Should I kill him, or drink with him? I like him and I don't have other friends. Nobody loves me. Life could be so funny... Because of women, you end up killing your friends and because of friends, you end up killing your women. I'll kill him. I'm sorry, dear friend. I'm not doing this because I'm evil, but because I have to. What can I do? I must kill you, please forgive me. 'Dear friend' shall be dead meat... I'd say we forget about this story. Wait! I hate meat, but I love freedom. Let's go! Please forgive me, dear friend. I'll take your appearance, since you're not around to interfere. Beauty! - Who is it? - It's me, the Brave. It's not working any more. - Who is it? - Your alter ego. Who? Let's say, a replica, a duplicate. Any way, I'm a woman who wishes you all the best. We really look alike. I bring you good news. The Brave shall come and save you. He already came, but stupid me didn't believe it was him. Good for you, what if it was the Dragon? Can you see what I see? - What? - Two Beauties, one for you and one for me. I can't see anything. You got drunk again! Go in there and be optimistic! Be careful, walk slowly... The Brave! The Dragon and his cousin! How can he be the Brave? Don't you know the Dragon killed him? - That's true. What is it? - The ghost. - Close the door! - I closed it. Stupid Dragon, he took us for a ghost. - Who is it? - It's me, the Brave. It's the Brave... - I wouldn't live at the North Pole. - The South Pole either. Why did you throw away the key? The Dragon shall see in the morning that we've been sleeping together and he'll be forced to let us get married. Good idea! Let's be good. I fooled him. I fooled her. Something's happening, but let's see what exactly. There's no one, I tell you. I saw her. - Who is it? - Nice people. - Cousin, give us your blessing. - Don't! You got us, that's it. - Forest Monster, is that you? - Cousin, is that you? - But who are these people? - Are you asking me that? - Cousin, what was that? - I'll explain to you later. We must get out of here. - You must explain everything! - All right. How are we supposed to get out if the door is locked? I've got an idea. - Brave! - How can he come over... - Brave, save me! - How can he come over if he's dead? Save me! I killed him. I smashed his brains against a pillow. - Good evening! - Good evening... ... Chicken Ghost... Ghost, please forgive me. It's not a ghost, it's the Brave. How is that possible? How has he risen from the dead? Awful door! Please, when I'm building something I do a good job. Look, here... Here... here... here... Beauty! - Who's calling me? - Surprise! Open up! It's the Brave. He came to save me. I was mislead again. Help! Hands up, Dragon! The ghost! Beauty, it's me, the Brave! I don't believe you even if you say you were my mother. That's worse than a masquerade. Bad thing you don't trust a Brave! Brave, I recognized you! Only you could say such honest words. My Brave, my love I waited for you and you arrived I shall always love you, Always, my love. Forget about it, it's not the right time. We have plenty of time to sing when we'll be old people. As you wish. They're going to escape. We shall see about that. What is it? Honorable Ghost, if you intend to kill us, do it gently. A Brave never kills meanly. Let us fight honorably. What's the use of fighting? Kill us and get over with it. - Brothers Belly and Throat! - Here we are. I hope you are a real gentleman and you are not going to hit a woman. - Open up! I'll take you with me. - No, I don't follow ghosts. - Why? - It's my rule. Do you care who you follow as long as you are saved? I'll go. Do not panic! I repeat... Get ready, prepare for battle. We are saved! Our people are here. - Step aside! - Pick me! What's with this crowd? Be disciplined! Women and children first! What are we then? At the fifth signal it's going to be morning. It's fantastic! I made it, that's why it's so great. - Do you hear me? - Let me sleep. Dad, we are here! Hello! Dad! - The King, your father... - What happened? - I can't tell you. - What is it? Tell me! He perished. They all perished during the battle against the Dragon. You are an orphan, darling. Me? An orphan? No way, my dear. - Yes, you are. - No, I am not. - You are an orphan. - I am not. - No, the King was not my father. - Yes he was. No he wasn't. You don't know that, but I was found as a child. The King wanted to have children, but no woman wanted to marry him because he was so evil, so he found me and raised me as his daughter. So much pain! Brave, I wish no more to live in this castle. - Take me in your woods, would you? - All right. Let me get some clean clothes. - So much pain, Bro Belly... - That's right. No kingdom, no wars... We are unemployed, Bro Throat. Bro Belly, why don't we open a pub here? Good idea! We are used to cleaning up. It's peace, it's a deserted land, we have no competitors... No customers... We can pray all we want. Peace has its charm. That's right. - Wardrobe shall be here. - Yes. Wow, the Ghost! - I have the honor to talk to... - The Great Council? In person and great again. - I think I know you. - I used to be his Highness gardener. - When you start to suspect things... - ... you end up going insane... Nice guy! What about the chubby girls? - It seems to me you are all dead. - We perished on the battle field. - How can you be dead if you are alive? - Who says I'm alive if I am dead? Drop it, it's not funny. Stop playing dead. - Who said I was dead, dear madam? - You are not alive either. - You are not dead. - What are you then? A ghost. Get scared! What are you doing? The ghost trick doesn't work any longer. We had our share of experiences with it. What am I doing, talking to some Earth creatures that are not initiated in the other world knowledge? I keep on explaining the King that we should let the castle to some rich tourists. We'd get plenty of money, scare them every night and have a lot of fun... But he wouldn't. Dear ghosts, I must tell you that our army is back together. It's revenge time! War! War! War! Our secret weapon has been upgraded. We added an innovative feature to it. It's going to fire forward. We are ghosts from the past, now we're going to be ghosts from the future. War! War! War! - What are you doing here? - I escaped from Dragon's claws. Go back there! If you are here, I have no excuse to start a war. Take her and bring her back to the Dragon. Back off, revengeful ghosts! Who's the young guy? Don't you dare! Get him! Use him for stew. I mean, make a salad out of him. Ghosts are vegetarian. Round ladder! Not that way, idiot! This way! Big ladder! I can't keep up, I'm not in good shape. "Beautiful one, in my loving sight You shine like a sunny light." "Your world admired beauty is divine I my love-filled heart it'll never decline." Balcony E 1. Help! Help! - It's between us two. - No, between us four. Follow them! Neutralize the Dragon! Take it to the right! Take it to the left! To the right, to the left... - Right of way! - Thank you! I love you! Sing! You called me, Brave. Fairy inside the premises! Finally, the time has come To say thank you from my heart... - Who is she? - A good fairy. I hope she is not too good. Do you think we can persuade her to sing less and run more? Cousin, hurry up, it's late. Show a little respect! A soul is expressing its drama. Loutish boys! Flowers picking, stories telling Moonlight branches was caressing Gently like a blessing. Stop singing, dear, the acoustics is bad here. What about her? Why can she sing? Because she's not being chased. - By the way, why are they chasing us? - Not us, they're chasing the Brave. Well, I'm after him, too. Come on, pair up! Hurry up! - Got you! - They got you. Oh, the ghosts! I forgot about them. Attack them! Go ahead! Get down! We really did exercised today. You only play team sports. I still don't understand why are those ghosts chasing you. Not me, you. Me? Are they jealous of me? They look down at you. They want war, they're revengeful. Cousing, I think they didn't have enough. They want another party. Listen up! If I seize you by the hair... Girls, try to calm down! If they were not after you, why were you running? To save you. You've been a real gentleman. You saved me. But why? To kill you. I want exclusive rights. Kill me? Why? Aren't we friends? Piu, Piu... You are a danger to society, a villain. - Who, me? - Bad character! It's not true! - We have an issue to address. - All right, we can do that. Right here, right now, no mercy. Our conflict needs to be solved. How do you want to fight? We can wrestle, we can fence with swords, we can prick each other with needles, we can smash our heads with martels or we can stare in each other's eyes. - To stare? - That's right. Just a second, let me ask. - What do you think? - No way. He stared at me once and now I'm madly in love with him. The cousin is right. I'm not available right now. I have a war to fight. This is not a game. I got carried away with love and forgot about my mission. Finally, the time has come To say thank you from my heart You were once the bravest one And you saved me from the start. Fire! Fire! Fire! Cousin! The earth is falling apart! Go away! - Who are their folks? - That would be us. - So many? - The planet is huge. I used to be a little bee An awful bumble bee My eyes could see. A dragon he resembled And he could kill me For a second I trembled But you came and saved me...
