Well aimed, Sir Roger, A perfect shot, my Lord. Boy, bring me my arrow. Come on, you heard what my master said. The arrow. Out of my way. Murderer! What did you say, boy? You killed my father. He was poaching deer. The penalty for that is death. -We were hungry. -The deer is a protected animal, boy. Are we not as good as animals, then? Indeed. And as the animals, you may feed as freely as you please. On grass. Well said, Sir Roger. Wallace, return the boy's arrow. Not that way, fool! Now, boy, let's have some sport. Even I never shoot a sitting bird. Run! Run, boy! Run! Wallace! Wallace, in the devil's name! Is this a new sport, hunting children? Sir... His father was about to kill a royal beast. King Richard is the... King Richard is on a crusade, as well you know. That order came from the Sheriff of Nottingham. And so? -So? -He killed my father. -Is what the boy says true? -It was not I who killed him. Oh, no. It was my good cousin, no doubt. It is one less Saxon to thieve and trouble us. And another left to grow and hate us more. Oh, get out of my sight! Get back to him. Will, see to it that he does. I don't trust him. Show me where your father lies. Where did you live, son? In the charcoal burner's refuge, Sir. No, I mean before. -Do you remember? -In a great mansion, before the Normans came and burned it to the ground. I'm a Norman, boy. I don't care! They took away my sister Marian, now they've killed... You have good reason to hate us. Is your name Fitzwarren, son? I see that it is. I knew your father, in better days. I'll make this right, I promise you. I've had enough of killing. Norman pig! -Stop! -He killed your father. -No, it was another. -Another Norman? -Yes, but... -Then it is an eye for an eye. But he saved my life! -Is this true? -It's true, I swear it. What does it matter? He's a Norman. It matters that we do not kilt for the sake of killing' Well, what say you? Do we let him go? Well, he saved the boy. We have the lad's word for that. Wait! De Courtenay. Aye, we've heard of you. More likely of my cousin, Roger. That's his name, the name of the other man. And may I be permitted to inquire who you are? Like Fitzwarren here, we were once men of property. Until King Richard left for the Holy Land and Prince John took his place. -I'm sorry. -Keep you sympathy, as you keep everything else. You go while you may. I charge you, look after the boy. A Norman shall die for this. Aye, but let it be the right one. You should have seen his face, Henry. It would have made even you smile. He had the beast right on the twp of his arrow when I let fly with mine, straight between the shoulders. And the boy? I left Wallace to deal with the brat. Shh, here's Father. He can't last much longer. Getting impatient, Roger? -Aren't you? I've no wish to see him go. For one thing, I'm not sure where I'll stand with you when he's gone. Steady, Friar, steady! We're doing very well. How about a little trot over to the table? Or a center, perhaps? You'll be the death of me, Friar. Not I, Sir John. -Good evening, Father. -Father. There you are, Roger. Good day in the field? Oh, very poor, Father. I shot nothing. Nothing, Roger? Perhaps cousin Robin is referring to your two-legged quarry, Brother. Be silent, fem! What's this? ROGER: An accident, Father, while hunting. Wallace, my man-at-arms, saw something move. We thought it was a deer. Wallace used his bow. It was a man. -Terrible. -I agree, Sir. But it was an accident. Oh! And the dead man's son, the boy, was that an accident too? The man was just a common thief, poaching royal deer. -I saw him draw his bow. -Well, then, you lie! In your teeth, you lie! You said you thought it was a deer and now you say it was a man. Are you accusing me, you ill-bred upstart, you? The man you killed was not a common thief. He was a Saxon noble before your friend Nottingham destroyed his world. Sir Brian Fitzwarren. No... In heaven, no! Oh, yes. I fear it is so. Fitzwarren? I knew him. I had no idea. -You really must be more careful, Roger. -Oh, hold your tongue! Enough, enough! -You say there was a bow -Oh, yes. His son. -He's alive. -Thank God for that mercy. -My Liege, by your leave. -Yes, steward? The Lady Marian Fitzwarren, with her retinue, seeks shelter for the night. Why do you wait, man? Tell the kitchens to prepare for company. My Liege. Lady Marian. Sir Brian's daughter. She was taken by Nottingham. It would seem that Nottingham was taken by her if she now has a retinue. Silence, Henry. Robin, pray bid our guests welcome. Mm... Lady Marian Fitzwarren, Sir. Robin of Courtenay. You're welcome. We're most grateful. We are on our way' to Nottingham. We will only stay a short while. You must wish to refresh yourself after your long journey. It has been tiring. My steward will show you to your chambers and your men will be well looked after. -Come, Mary. Welcome, Miss Mary. No bother, she's just a mam-servant. My Lady, welcome to Courtenay. We thank you for your hospitality, Sir John. Let's to table. You must be starving. My son, Roger. Henry. And Robin you've already met. And our good Friar. What are you giving us? Fresh trout, salmon, roast capon. whole roast pig... Stop, stop! Pray continue with the recitation while you serve. -What about Miss Mam -Ooh, how remiss of us. Friar, take her to the buttery. Charge them to see her well. What... now. my Lord? Of course. She must be hungry. -Like all of us. -Hungry. Yes, my Liege. My Lady, it is... seldom we have such pleasant company at Courtenay. Now, before we eat... ...a toast. King Richard. ALL: King Richard. Success to his crusade. But surely you've heard Richard is taken prisoner. In Germany, His ship foundered and he was seized and taken prisoner there. God in heaven... Boy, the apothecary. Quick! Well? At any moment. Within the hour at most. Scribe... and my servants... the win. He wants his servants to hear the will. Scribe? John of Courtenay, Knight, this is my intent and will... bear witness. To my good Friar Tuck, a hundred crown. To Little John, Will Scarlet, and my other retainers, a thousand more to be divided. For the rest of my estate, to Roger, Henry and Robin, in equal parts, I give my castle, curtilage, and purse. God rest my soul, to this my seal. I, John. This is not right. Robin is no son of yours. Your cousin has been better than a son to me. He deserves his share. Now, you've all heard my will. -Give me that! -Sir Roger. I cannot. H's entrusted... So much for that. If we were not in this chamber... I care not so much about the will, but you have marred a good man's dying moments here. And for nothing too. AH these here have heard the wilt as he intended they should. Bad luck, dear Brother. That we'll see. Myself, I bear you no grudge. Thank you, Henry. We've never been friends nor have we been enemies, so... ...let it remain so. -Oh, and Wallace? -Sir? I'm promoting you to master-at-arms. -Thank you, Sir. -You'll earn it. Give orders that no-one leave this place without my permission. And send a message to Nottingham. Tell him my father is dead and that I would speak with him at Courtenay here. It will be done. And speedily, or you will suffer for delay. Stay with him, Tuck. ROGER: We will talk in here. We have to come here to tam No better place for what I have to say. And he won't disturb us anymore. -Well? -Straight to the point. And this could be it for you. Yes. As you can see, this is Robin's dagger. So I see. You'd kill me, then have Robin blamed. Is that it? -Not if you would help. -Kill Robin? Then his estates would all be ours. The choice is yours. What choice? I'm unarmed. And if I do agree to see our cousin off, how hang before my time to die, hm? Oh, no, my sweet brother. I've still some pride. If I kill you, I get your share as well. I've nothing much to lose. Guard? Guard! ROGER: Guard! May God forgive him. Steward! Steward, my brother has been murdered! Fetch the guard! Robin! Robin! -Your cousin Henry has been murdered. Murdered? With your dagger. I saw Roger do it. No, Robin. No, no! You must get away. He's called the guard. I went in there to pray. I found my brother stabbed beside my poor father. Well, you saw the weapon used. Break down this door and take the murderer away! I'll see you right when I return. You'll see me right now. I'm coming with you. Oh, no, you're not. I don't know what the future holds. Well, the future will hold nothing for me if they catch me here. ROGER: Come on, harder! AH right. Come on, then. -I'm coming back. -Don't look down. -I'm not looking anywhere. -Go on. ROGER: Come on! Break it down, fool! -I'm stuck. I can't! -ROGER: Harder! Once more, now! You can! ROGER: Come on! Break this door down! GUARD: I'm trying! ROGER: Quickly, man, use a bow! Come on! Quickly, quickly! There's but one place that arrow could have come from, the battlements. And there's but one man who could have placed an arrow thus. -Will Scarlet. -The same, my Lord. He'll learn the price of helping a murderer escape. By his act he is himself made traitor. Take every man you can muster and search this castle till you find him. And remember, I want him alive. Now, go. One of you to the battlements, and you two come with me. GUARD: There's nobody on the battlements, Sir. WALLACE: Very well, then. Cover all the gates. He must be down here. Wallace! Sir? -No sign yet? -No, my Lord. But it is only a matter of time. He shall not escape the castle, that I'll warrant. Let your warrant hold good, for I'll have either Master Scarlet or you at the end of a noose, and that I'll warrant. And by heaven, I'll not be only one to suffer if he's not found. Move, you oafs, move! Little did I think there'd be a day when I'd be pleased to see Will Scarlet. But so it is. Come, let Sir Roger share our Measure. Oh, Robin, I can go no further. Leave me here for I must rest. Of course. We'll stay a while. We should be far enough away by now. I never knew that a body could get so fired. Bring him in! We have him, my Lord. So, you flushed the treacherous rat from his hole. Bring him here! You've done well, Wallace. It seems that we have lost one traitor to discover another. Robin de Courtenay is no traitor. And I say that he is. It is well known that he was out of sympathy with Prince John. It is certain that he murdered my loyal brother, Henry. And furthermore, I say that you knew of his treachery and that you share it. Take him to the dungeon. And remember, you guard him with your life. Tuck. The Sheriff of Nottingham. I wonder how much he knows. I'm not waiting to find out. See who they are. First four men after them. Robin, where did it come from? GUARD: There they are! Well... somebody is on our side. He surely is, my son. Bring those men to me at Courtenay castle. Aye, my Lord. Gee up! CAPTAIN: Sergeant! Quick. CAPTAIN: Sergeant! He's gone. Yes, but he'll be back with the others. Come on. We meet again. Thanks to the boy. I would have had them take you. That's not true, Alan. You know it's not. I couldn't let the Friar die. A very proper sentiment, my good fellow. Come with me. Let me tell you now, I do this for the sake of young Stephen and the Friar. He doesn't mean it. That was the best meal I've ever had. Because you needed it, that's an. Possibly. But anyway, thank you, er... His name is Much. Oh! Thank you very much, Much! Well, Robin, I'm feeling myself again. -Yes. Well, there's plenty to feel. -What? Oh. And I thank you too. Well, come on, Tuck. We must be on our way. Oh, no. -He knows too much about us now. -That's true. -I give you my word. -Ha! The word of a Norman? No. The word of Robin de Courtenay. Am I likely to give you away? I'm just as much an outlaw as yourselves. ALAN: Explain yourself. Well, I've been accused, falsely, of murder, by my cousin, Roger de Courtenay. This good Friar and I escaped just in time. -So, you see, I'm a wanted man. -We both are, Then, why not stay with us? We know how well he fights. -Alan saw him, didn't you? -Aye, with a sword, Well, what else does one fight with? Swords are not easy to come by. We have to make do with quarterstaffs here. Well? MUCH: Wow! You made your point, Norman. -You fight well. -And that's when he's exhausted. I don't suppose you use the bow? Try him. Just try him. Boy, get one of those pigeons and tie a piece of cotton to its tail. -Oh, no, Friar. -I do insist. Boy, release the bird. Shh. MEN: Wow! Any man who can use a bow like that can keep it. -I'll make another. -Oh, thank you. Yeah, well, just make sure you use it against the Sheriff's men. I'll try. Well, now, what's your plan? Oh, come, you must have a plan! Our plan is to stay alive as best we can. Agreed, but what defences have you against the Sheriff's men? Eh, would you have us build a wall around this glade? Exactly that. A wall of thorn and thicket. Why not? Sentries posted to watch the roads, and a code of signals to warn us of impending danger. -I'll go with you on that. -And me. What else? Some different-coloured garb to hide us in this green. Here these colours stand out like a peacock's plume. Ah, if only I'd had some money with me when I left. There's many a rich merchant that passes through here. He's right. It's the only way. Robin, I never thought it of you. You should Know, good Friar. Needs must when the devil drives. Please, Robin. Well, that's enough to think of. For the moment. And it is more than we have thought of since we met. Men, I think we've found in De Courtenay here our natural leader. Now, what say you? MUCH: Nan-a-Dale? -A Norman? -King Richard is a Norman. Aye, that's true enough. All right. But I cannot call him by that hated name, De Courtenay. -Call him Robin. -Just Robin? I know! We'll call him Robin Hood. He's quite a man. But not the man for you, my dear Lady Marian. Little John is champion. There's no-one will take him on at the next fair. You're to hold a fair? With Sir John and your brother newly dead? It helps to keep the peasants sweet. Listen, Courtenay, you've done well so far. Done well? I don't know what you mean. You know what I mean. Your father gone, your brother dead, Robin branded as his murderer. But your game is not won with Robin still at large. What news of Robin? Any? None. Or of that Friar Tuck. Your Friar gone too? Why didn't you tell me this before? Those men I saw in Sherwood Forest, one of them was dressed in priestly garb. So that's where they are! I'll assemble my men right away. And waste your time? No, we must set a trap to draw him out. A trap? Some bait he can't resist. That plan you were talking of, I have the bait right here. Hm? Will Scarlet, Robin's friend. Yes. They'll enjoy a hanging at the fair. Well-aimed, Wallace. Mary? -I shall retire. -Yes, Lady Marian. You know, Lady Marian's maid-servant is a pretty little thing too. For almost the first time, I find myself in complete agreement with you. LADY MARIAN: And see you press them carefully. I want them first thing in the morning. Yes, Lady Marian. Why are you so sad? Does Lady Marian scold you? -She has an acid tongue, I know. -It isn't that, Sir. A lover gone perhaps. Is that the cause? I'm sure of it. Oh, do not fret. There are others that can bring the smile back to those rosy lips. The colour to those cheeks. Me, for instance. Come to my room in one hour. A girl of spirit. Good. Men have been killed for doing less to Nottingham. Oh, I'm sorry, Sir. I didn't know you in the shadows. Well, now you do. So here's another, for good measure. Hold! What the devil is the meaning of all this? Now, Sir, if you'll kindly dismount. Do you know who I am? My name is Sir Jamyl de Penitone. Lord of the Manor of Muncaster. I see you've heard of me. Oh, yes. I've heard of you. And you will hear more before you swing on the gibbet. Ah, well... In the meantime, you will dismount. My friend here is curious as to what makes your saddle bags bulge like ms own paunch. My curiosity is tormenting me beyond endurance. "And the proud shall be cast down." It's easy to be brave with that rabble about you. I see you've stolen a gentleman's sword. I wonder if you'll have the courage to use it like one. You're not very good, are you? It's all fight. Robin's playing with him. I think you're getting the hang of it. I could kill you now. But you'll make a very fitting dancing partner to that other traitor, Scarlet. Now, Sir, what did you say of Will Scarlet? I'll run you through if you say again that he's a traitor. Well, if he's not, it's his ill luck, because Sir Roger is having him hanged as one this afternoon at De Courtenay fair. The devil he will. Friar, I think those saddle bags could do with a little slimming. If you touch that gold, there won't be enough of you left to hang on a gibbet, after the Sheriff of Nottingham has finished with you. Then it is the Sheriff's gold? It's gold legally collected in taxes for Prince John. Well, from what I hear, Prince John has enough, and to spare. That money can be returned to the people from whom it was extorted. Tie ms hands and set him on his horse. If I had not become a friar, I think I would have been a banker. Set them towards Courtenay. SIR JAMYL: You'll hear more of this. I can assure you of that. Well, gentlemen, Will Scarlet needs our help. Slow down! What are you trying to do, choke me? -That's not a bad idea. What? I say, the road is very rough here. Well, slow down, I say. I'm eating. -As usual, greedy guts. -Eh? I said the road, it's full of ruts. -Well, stop, Stop! -Whoa! We'll stop here while I finish me pie. Here you are. They say there are outlaws in the forest here. Oh? Ah, stuff 'n' nonsense. Old wives' tale. Surround the dray! What? The two of us? Do your best! Spread out a bit. Good morrow, airs. Now, if you so much as lay one finger on me, my cousin, the Sheriff of Nottingham, will get to hear of it. Oh... So you're related to the Sheriff, are you? I am. I am indeed. I am. So you claim cousin to that lying, scheming, thieving, treacherous, dastardly Sheriff? Actually, er... I've not been very well lately, you see, Sir, and... He's only my second cousin. Twice removed. Well, that deserves an arrow. If we cannot kill the Sheriff, we can at least have his second cousin twice removed. No! I knew you'd get into trouble one of these days, with your claims of high connections. He's a... a greedy-gutted little bladder of wind, Sir. Uh... He means no harm. He's never even seen the Sheriff. Lies fall from his mouth like leaves from the trees, Sir. You have a good advocate and friend. His origin is as humble as my own, Sir. It is no crime trying to better oneself to improve one's forebears, as it were. No, but I would advise you to choose your relations more carefully. I will, good Sir. Indeed I will. And what are you doing in Sherwood? I was driving him to De Courtenay fair, Sir. De Courtenay fair? DRIVER: He has a place reserved there. -He sells pies, Sir. Pies. -Just ordinary pies. -Yes! Just ordinary pies? You son of Beelzebub! Ordinary pies, indeed! Will you allow me, Sir, just to show you, Sir? Excuse me, Sir. Now, good Sir, take a look at this golden, succulent brown crust, made from flour, every grain of which has been tested. Good Sir, do feel this crust. Here we are! Filled with the most delicious meats, and covered with a gravy made with nine ingredients. And all this, gentlemen, for the miserly sum of one penny. You, good Friar, you look a man who likes good food. -Well... -Here we are, Sir. Just right for a man of your size and position, hm? Now, gentlemen, which among you would care to sample this culinary miracle? You, Sir? And you, Sir? And how about you, Sir? Will you take one? -I'll take the lot. -Ah, good! And the dray. Good Friar, you're a man of God. Surely you will not stand by and let him do this to me. My friend, God works in many mysterious ways. Perhaps you're being punished for some past misdemeanour, some forgotten sin, the sin of greed perhaps. Oh, I beg you, Sir. Do not rob me of me livelihood. It would be kinder to plunge your sword into me now. I'm as surely bleeding to death. Well, try that as a poultice on the wound. With this, I could buy three sets of drays. Good Friar, you were right. God does indeed work in the most unexpected ways. Indeed, He does. The pie's excellent. What need have we of all these pies? And the dray? To get us into the fair. Come along, everybody! Roll up! Fresh pies, only two pence each. Who'll buy my pies? Now, Sir, you look like a man who appreciates a good pie. Only two pence for a perfect pie crust. A mouth-watering miracle. Only two pence. Who told you to put the price up? Oh, say a prayer for me, kind Friar. Money is a vice with me. Hm, and not the only one. Now, come, let Much take your place. We'll spy out the ground, see if there's any Sign of Will. No, Robin. Wan here. These are noble animals you have. Indeed, they are, good Friar. This filly there, may I take a look at her? Hm. Have a care, but she is not kind to strangers. She seems to take to you. Well, we're not strangers. Master Robin! Now, don't give me away. That, I'd never do. But, this is madness, Sir. Nottingham's men are an around. Some dressed in peasants' garb. Are they indeed? Thank you for that. I hear my cousin is going to stretch Will Scarlet's neck. Poor Will. A good friend of mine. Hm. And, of mine, Justin. So, what are we going to do about it? Do? We? Yes, Justin, you and I. May I rely on your help? You can. You know it will mean banishment from Courtenay. You'll have to join my band. Willingly. The password is "Hood". Act on any word that comes from him. I will. There will be others who will join us. Well, the more the merrier. And, er... it is a good stout cloth? Indeed, Sir. It's cord and will never wear. Too bright. Yes, it is for you, good Friar, but for a fine-looking gentleman er... -Have you the same in brown or green? -In green, yes. A fine Lincoln green. But this Cloth is not the cheapest, Friar. Perhaps this... Oh, no matter. My friend here is paying. He supports our order. Indeed. Do not be deceived by my humble garb. I am noted for my charitable works. What length of the green, good Sir? -All of it. -All of it? -Mm. -It's for the Brothers at his order. What order wears a cloth of green? The order of Saint Patrick. Now, hurry, man. Hurry. Have Much put it on the dray and warn him to guard it well. And buy some I've chickens, and some beer, some wine. Everything you think we might need. Everything? -Within reason. It may take time, but I promise you I'll do my best. Come, Stephen. -There's Marian. -Quiet, Stephen. Now, quiet! Let me go! It's my sister. Let me go! Stephen! Try to understand you can't see her. She's a great Lady now. Then why should she walk behind the rest? Well, she... What did you say? -Where did she walk? -Behind the rest. No, that was Mary, you sister's maid-servant. It was Marian. Should I not know my own sister? But in heaven's name... I remember now. My father, he told her, it the Normans should come, to hide in the kitchens with the servants. And Nottingham has put someone else in her place, giving her the title of Lady. Why? Why should he do that? Well, no doubt he owed her for some favours. Marian looked so sad. If only I could see her once again. Maybe you will see her, Stephen. And sooner than you think. Come on. -One moment, you! -Yes, my good man? -Don't you "good man" me. -Leave him alone! Leave him alone! Leave him alone! Who do you think you are? -Who are you? -I'm the Captain of the Sheriffs guard. Yeah? And I'm Archbishop of Canterbury. Go on, get off, you fool! Try not to drink so much, my son. I'll pray for you. Looks as though he'll need a few prayers. Come on, we've got to work fast. Where have you Maced your men? My men? Well, you can see them all around the tent. And none amongst the crowd, no doubt. You show little knowledge of tactics, my friend. How fortunate for you that I'm here. -Well done, Sir. -Thanks. My Lords, Lady, gentlefolk, and citizens, the winner, Justin, man-at-arms for Courtenay. And next, a wrestling bout. I present the champion, Little John, master-at-arms. ANNOUNCER: Is there any man to take the champion on? Boys. ANNOUNCER: Come, gentlemen! Will one of you give the champion a fight? Stephen, go to the dray. Tell Alan about your sister and that the plan is slightly changed. ANNOUNCER: Is there no volunteer among you who will try his luck? Has no man got the courage to take... Ah! A challenger! I have to see men wrestle. And after this, a hanging. There's no end to the entertainment. -Your name, good man? -The Masked Monk. A good idea! They like a novelty like that. My Lords and gentlefolk, I give you the Masked Monk. Let the bout begin! Robin! What the devil are you doing here? Put back the mask before they recognise me. What are you doing here? Look, I've got to win this bout so I can get into the tent and claim the prize. -It will mean your death. -But I'm willing to risk that. Well, some on, tell me what to do, you big oaf! -All right, bring your knees up quickly. -All right. Robin, they're starting to recognise you. It's obvious! Painful, too! Good! That's real. -Now pull my beard. -All right, all right... Very good! -What now? -Take my head and throw me. -Right! -When I let my arms go! Right! -That Masked Monk is rather good. -Yes, he is. We have to end the match, and quickly! Grab my shoulders... Collect your prize. I daren't go back to the castle after this. -Then don't. Join us. -You need somebody to look after you. You! Guards! ROBIN: Take her away! Guards! Take him! To the gallows with him. Hang him alongside his friend, Will Scarlet. Hang him. Hang him! You knew! I make it my business to know everything. Wan a minute. I'm sorry, Sir. God rest your soul. Come on! There's plenty for everyone! Get Robin and Will. I'll take care of the guards. Ha-hey! -Come on, Robin. -Jump. Now! STEPHEN: Come on, Robin! Get them! Guards! Stop them! Stop them! Well done. Come on! Follow us! Come on! To the forest! Furthermore, it is decreed that whosoever shall fail to pay these just taxes shall incur dispossession, all his goods being forfeited. But, Sir, how can we pay? We have nothing. The excuse of the indolent. Throw their rubbish onto the fire. Oh, please, good Sir! Unhand me, you insolent dog. Oh, but, Sir, if you will but give us a Mile time. GUARD #1: Hey, you, come away! GUARD #2: Come on, now. Get over there! You know well that I am protected by the warrant of the Sheriff of Nottingham. It is to him that you shall answer. -Bind him. -Yes. Come on, you! And set fire to their hovel Oh. no... Our home! -Drive on. -DRIVER: Gee-up! Hey! Hey! There hasn't been a deer over this ground for days. Then we must search until we find them. Each day brings us new mouths to feed as John's tyranny swells our company, Our company might swell, but I shrink. I swear, if we do catch a deer, I'm hungry enough to eat it raw. It seems that may not be necessary. Look. Strange! I would not have thought the forest is dry enough to burn. What could have caused it? The cause may be nearer that you think. To cover! Quick! It's the Bailiff of Nottingham. Now, there's a man that enjoys his work. They've taken young Ranolph, the Charcoal burner's son. Wait. -Aye, laddie, wan. Now! -WILL: Get along, come, come! -LITTLE JOHN: Bring the lad. If you don't stop your whimpering, I'll let the wind out of your body. AH right, he's mine. He struck down my father and burned our hut. Hold. I beg you, do not let him murder me in cold blood. Take the gold, take all of it, but spare my er. If you must wave that sword around, laddie, watch over those chickens. I wonder how many people's er blood was sweated away for this! But I only did as I was ordered. What shall we do with him, Robin? Send him back the way he came. Unarmed. -But these forests are full of outlaws! -So they tell me. Will, help me turn the coach. But they'll cut my throat as soon as look at me. Oh, sooner, that I'll warrant. It would be a pity to spoil such a splendid garment with your blood. This coat would keep a worthy peasant warm this coming winter. Take it off! You'll pay for this, both of you! Come on. Come on, my friend! Off with it! -And the hose? -And the hose. No. no! You... You've been eating too many pies, my good Bailiff. Come on, now. Not so much struggling. -There we are! -Come on, now, my fat friend! -Up with him. -Up! Now, I would advise you to make good speed, because if the outlaws don't get you, the peasants probably will. Right, move! The Bailiff of Nottingham, without his clothes! And without the gem. Prince John will not thank us for this day's work. No, but there are others who will. For myself, I wish we could eat the stuff. My belly is flapping like the wings of a crow. Robin! Well, with luck it won't be flapping for long. The supply wagon for Courtenay castle. Ooh! I can almost taste the succulent morsels intended for Sir Roger's table. Mm. Now, wait. We'll take them from flank. You wait here, laddie. Now, let's see what we've got. LITTLE JOHN: Look at them. There's enough food here to last us for a week, Robin. Good. Alan, the gold. But how can I repay you? By finding who was robbed of these taxes. And then helping us to return the gold. That I will. Take this. This will repay you for the loss of your home. Thank you. Now, when you want us, come and look for us in the forest. We shan't be hiding. Good luck. Hey! Good luck. -Warm work, John? -Aye, but honest, Robin. -How's it going? -Almost done, Robin. Good! They won't be long in trying to find us, I'm sure. -Is that good? Delicious, a vintage year. Here, leave some for us, old Madder podge. Hold your tongue, Much, or you will not be remembered in my prayers. I apologise for the manners of some of our company, Marian, but their hearts are in the right place. Never mind their hearts, what of their stomachs? You do not have to convince me, Robin. After the company I've had to endure these past twelve months... -You cannot imagine. -Yes, I think I can. But it's all over now. Gentlemen, some wine. Rest for a while. Join me in a toast and a wedge. To our King... Richard. May he be freed soon, and return and rule us in peace and prosperity. And the pledge? To rid this land of Regent John, of Nottingham, and all others who would oppress free men. And your cousin Roger. That is a private matter I shall deal with myself. -King Richard! -ALL: King Richard! Some news! It's red! Nottingham's men are in the forest, so out, all of you' Here, but what about my roast? -Keep it hot for us, Much. -I'm coming with you, aren't I? No, you're not. You're staying here with Marian and the boy. And I Charge you, guard them with your life. -But... -Look, I know what you're going to say. But you're not old enough as yet. Next time, perhaps. -All right? -ALL: Aye! What's Robin doing? We'll lose them soon if we don't... -It's green. -They're ready. Here they come. Run and yell like mad. CAPTAIN: Come on, men! After them! This way! There's one of them! CAPTAIN: Fools! Scatter and find them! Hey, you there! Have you seen any strangers around here? -Well, now, er... let me think... -Answer, man, or suffer for it later! Well, I did see a couple of men running. I think they went through that way. Oh. well. they couldn't have got... -Can I help you, my children? -No, that's all right, Father. Blessed are the meek. I said, blessed are the meek! -Hey! -Hey, what's happening? For they shall be exulted. You, hey! Hey! Hey, let us down! Are you all right? Yes, thanks to you. Marian! Some cloth to stem this wound. Robin! -No, it's all right, it's not for me. It's for our guest here. Some wine. I don't want your charity. My men surround this place. Oh, dear, I'd forgotten about them. Here they come. Put the pretty birds in the cage, lads. I think you'd better have this wine, don't you? You saved my life. I shan't forget it In you go. Steady, Will. Time that young soldier was in bed. Off you go. -I can go with you next time, Robin? -Er... Perhaps. Thank you for baking after him, Robin. He's so happy here. And you? Are you happy here? I've never been happier. -But for one thing. -And that? It cannot last, can it? No... not like this. -If only... -If we were... Well, it's a waste of time to talk like that. We must just face life as it comes. I'm not afraid. As long as there are moments like this. There will be.

Come and join me. The prisoners! How long have they been from your sight? Er... I can't understand it! I scarcely took my eyes off them. Ere! ere! And there's another! And another. ALAN: They fired the forest. Take whatever you need to beat out the flames. John, you take your party to that one. Alan, you take that one. The rest of you, come with me. Much, stay here. Look after Marian and the boy. -If there's any danger, sound the horn. -Aye, Robin. Come on, Tuck. It's a trick! Back to the camp before it's too late! We've been tricked! Come on, quick! They've taken Marian and the boy. And they've killed a good friend of mine, and of yours. What's your plan, Robin? Well, it was Nottingham's men, and Nottingham was at the castle with my cousin Roger. So, if Marian and the boy are there, we are going in to get them out. Not quite so lively this time, are we, my dear? Not quite the same spirit, hm? What shall we do with her, my friend? Use her as bait for Robin. In the meantime, do what you win. Lock her up in my room. -And the boy, my Lord? -Put him to work in the kitchens. Don't worry, Marian! Robin will come. Now all we have to do is to wait for him. Shouldn't be too long. News travels fast. Steward! Wine. Did you not hear me? Wine! There's none left, my Liege. What? With respect, and begging your pardon, my Liege, nothing has been paid these last two months. Then bring some mead. Mead, we have, my Liege, but little enough of that in faith. ROGER: Oh, leave us! And the servants, my Liege, they have not been pad for... Did you not hear me? Leave us! My Liege. You should pay your dues, De Courtenay. -With what? -Your father was a rich man. AH gone. To pay for Richard's travels in the east. What are you going to do? Wait a moment. If the people of England will pay for Richard's safe return, will not the people of Sherwood do the same for their beloved Robin? Master Robin! It's good to see you, old friend. And tell Sir Roger I'm here. My Liege, my Liege! -Well, what is it, fool? Master Robin! H's Master Robin! So, the trap has sprung and caught the rat. And sooner than we thought. Wallace? -My Lord. Bring him to me, by armed guard. Take him. You have two unwilling guests here, Roger, Lady Marian and her brother. -Lady Marian? -Oh, that woman is an impostor. You made it known the prisoners would be released if I came here alone and unarmed. Well, here I am. You fool. You poor fool. Take him away. And look him in the coldest and wettest dungeon there is. I wonder who's the bigger fool. Get all our men out of quarters and double the guard. Boy, read it to me. It's from Robin. "Good friend, when I was young, "you showed me a passage through the moat. "Open it now, I pray you." It's over here. Help me, boy. Help me! -You sure that's it? -Of course, I'm sure. Below the postern gate, he said. Right. Do you know what to do, lads? -MEN: Aye. Good. As soon as we give the signal, follow. Come on. Hey! -What is it? -Thought I heard something. Ah, you've been eating too much rabbit stew. Mm, that's true. What I wouldn't give for a nice big fat roast pig or some duck. Duck, you saw Roast duck it will be, my friend. Do you see what I see? Well done, boy. That's it, Lift, lift. It's no good. It's rusted in. It'll never move. It must, it must! Lackey. Ale. No wine? -I'm sorry, gentlemen. -Take it away. Fish? I hate fish and the steward knows it. -Bring him here at once! -Yes, Sir. Gentlemen! Gentlemen, I promised you some sport tonight. And you shall have it. Fetch the prisoner. This should be good. My master knows a trick or two. I've no taste for this sort of thing. -I'll seek my entertainment another way. -Good hunting, then. Oh, and by the way, I doubled the guard with my men. Why your men? Why? Hasn't it occurred to you that Robin's friends may try to get him back? And the girl and the boy? No, perhaps it hasn't. I am Master of Courtenay! What right have you... Every fight! We both have so much to lose. The prisoner, Sir. Welcome, good cousin. Bring him here. You look cold, dear cousin. We mustn't have you catching a chm, must we? You, there, stoke up the fire. Let's have a good blaze. And warm him up. -LITTLE JOHN: Can you see anything? -WILL: No, it's too dark. ALAN: Shh! Listen. WILL: Right, that's the signal. Come on. ALAN: There's two bolts. It's no use. We'll never shift it. Master Edwin? Ah, there you are. He wants you upstairs immediately. Come on, he's waiting. -LITTLE JOHN: Are you clear? -ALAN: Yes, push. Come on. Well, all's well so far. Are you sure the others know what to do? Yes. When we throw off the guards, they're to storm the gate. Come on. By the way, dear Robin, someone upstairs is getting warm in quite a different way, if I know Nottingham. Pretty little thing, Mary. Or should I say, Lady Marian? This must be it. It's rusted in. Let me try. It's no use, it won't move. Oh, yes, it will. -Little John! -Hello, laddie. -Where's Robin? -They've got him in the Great Hall. Have they? ALAN: Come on. He's shivering. Put another log on the fire. My Lord! Yes, and you will get the same unless you bring me something good to eat. Find me some... some special dish or you will fry too. Yes, that's better. Come on now, Will, hurry. STEWARD: Sir Roger wants a special dish. Well, let's give it to him. Out! STEWARD: Did you hear me? Sir Roger wants a special dish. It's coming up. Coming up, Sir Roger. Guards! MARIAN: Oh... oh... Are you all right? I must rejoin the fight. Then go quickly. Nottingham! You... -Thanks, Father. -Thank the Lord. Robin! I was just beginning to enjoy it. I'll go and find Robin. Robin! It's just that he should die as your father died. With an arrow in his back. Come, Alan. We've work to do. Nottingham? -Yes. Seems the work will have to wait for a little while. But no castle Shall be strong enough to save him from us. It will not be the same without him, whatever you say. His name is cleared. The castle is his. He has no need of... I now pronounce you man and wife, LITTLE JOHN: Robin! Will, Alan, and John! What delayed you? -Well, we thought that you... -We didn't think you... You thought I'd given up this life, with Richard a prisoner still, England in John's hands, and our friend the Sheriff of Nottingham at large? Oh, no, my friends. There's too much work to be done. But not now, surely. Oh, no, not now. Tomorrow. Ah, tomorrow. But in the meantime, what about the wedding breakfast? Yes! Come on, lads.
