Don't blink your eyes. Look at me. Are you going out with Lisandro? Yes Will he continue to eat? I don't know. Perhaps. This is a good one: Eve wakes up confused and asks Adam where they are. Adam replies: We are naked, have no home, work or money and they keep saying this is paradise. Then we should be in Mexico." What a know-it-all, that Adam. You ran away. - Have you talked to your father? - Not yet. - When are you going to talk to him? - I don't know. I can ask you the same. Have you spoken to him? You always do what he says. You don't even dare ask him for money. Lets see... See, very beautiful. Like Mother like daughter. Don't be home late. Did you hear me? I don't have to ask you if you cleaned your room? - Did you feed Lencho? - Not yet, I'll do it when I get back. I have to go, it's late. He's waiting for me. It's like talking to a wall. You never listen. Like Mother like daughter. I love you too. See you later. - Hello Miss. Are you Laura's mother? - Yes. If you want to see your daughter again, come to Los Antojitos in 10 minutes. - But why? - Come to Los Antojitos in 10 minutes. Otherwise you won't see her again. Hello welcome. On the menu today we have beef stock and a dessert, pudding or custard of your choice. Or a consomm√© as a starter and enchiladas as a main course. What do you take? - No, thank you. - Shall I bring the menu? We also have eggs, in every way. - Scrambled eggs, fried, with ham... - Yeah, that's right. It's coming like this. Lisandro? What's happening? Where are you? Hey, at work? And Laura? I'm looking for her. She said she was going out with you. I will call you back. How are you? You get my father's greetings. And Laura? She's okay. She is calm, no problems. Are you holding her? Yes. It's up to you if we don't hurt her. But why? Let her go, please. Ma'am, we don't decide that. How are you? No way. We said 200,000. What is he saying? He's lying, that bastard swims in the money. And his ranch? Tell him to cooperate. Keep me informed. Bye gentlemen. What do you want to order? - A sincronizada and a Coke. - Ditto. - And fast. - Coming. What did Laura do to you? Listen, ma'am... we have no problem with your daughter, and she with us. We just need 150,000 pesos. But I have no money. Where should I find 150,000 pesos? If you want to see Laura again, give me 150,000 pesos and your husband's beautiful black pickup truck. Please don't hurt her. Give us the money, and you'll get her back. I know you can do this. Tomorrow you bring us the money. We will say where. And without the authorities. No police, no soldiers. Understood? - I need to speak to my husband. Urgently. - What? Stupid bitch. Is she not with you? Damn, who invited you? What are you doing here? Laura, Gustavo. Laura! Have you seen her? Spoken? You know well she doesn't talk to me. She was taken by gangsters. They took Laura. How come, taken? I don't know. Taken, kidnapped. What are you talking about? They want money. - Who wants money? - I don't know. Two guys. They got me stuck. Listen, I don't have time for your silly games. This is not a game. It's your daughter. She went out and didn't come home. Then they hit me on the street. I called her. She doesn't answer. Sooner or later she would get in trouble. - It's probably a joke, she'll be back. - New. This is real. Laura wouldn't pull a joke like that. Like you don't know her. With her character... Listen, Laura is mad at me. - And she's doing this to piss me off. - Do you think she kidnapped herself? Do you know what the cartel is doing to those people? Gustavo, I mean it, leave our problems out of this. They kidnapped our daughter. Those motherfuckers never stop. They kidnapped the son of the grocery store woman. He's still not back. We have to go to the police. If you go to the police, those bastards will find out. That's how it works. They know everything. What do we do then? Why did you let her go out? She went out with Lisandro. But he said she canceled. - I don't get it. - I have said it. There's some air here. Gustavo, it must be true. Do you want to play with your daughter's life? How much do they want? 150,000 pesos and your pickup. The dirty bastards. No way. No choice, dear. I think you will have to pay. Did we really call everyone? Nobody knows anything. I had to write 3 checks for 25,000 to withdraw the money. From my savings and business account. And to what I already had, almost 50,000. I have nothing more. How much can you withdraw? I? You know we can barely live on the little money you give us. I had set aside 8,000. Then we're almost there. They will have to negotiate. Give them what they want. - This is serious. - I know that. What do you want me to do? You'll be fine, you'll see. Don Gustavo, dona Cielo. We're here for the delivery. And the keys? And Laura? If everything's okay, we'll drop her off in front of the cemetery in 15 minutes. You did not say that the amount was not complete. It's... It didn't go the way I expected. Lisandro? They didn't bring her back. - Is there any news here? - New. I've been waiting here for a long time, but nothing. Do you know who kidnapped her? Why didn't you come pick her up? Who picked her up? I don't know, Don Gustavo. We agreed, but she had texted her that she didn't want to go out anymore. Idiot! You should have come get her! You have to take care of her! How could you let her go alone? All alone? It's your fault, both of you! I couldn't help it. My dear dona Cielo... I've heard about it. Don Quique... It's unimaginable. We don't deserve this. I know that. Gustavo told me - that they want more money. - Yes. They want 50,000 more. We must inform the authorities. New. If you do, they'll kill Laura. That's what I said. Agree, we can't report this. But pay more? With what money? If you want... can I lend you some money in exchange for merchandise. Don Quique, that's very generous of you. Do you see, dear? That's the solution. We don't even know if she's still alive. Don't say that! Good evening. I hope you liked the trip. I thought the fresh air would do you good. You made Dad angry with the missing money. And I had to pay for it. Since he hasn't paid us, we're counting on you. We want to know if Laura is okay first. We need proof! I told you, I take care of her. She gets along well with the lady who cooks for us. Where is she? If we don't see her, you won't get a cent. Even if you kill us! Your wife is a real drama queen. The money. - I hope the amount is correct now. - Everything is there. And Laura? This is a present for me. My father wants us to leave, it's getting too dangerous here. We paid for everything. Give our daughter back! Madam... If I say I'll give her back, I will. We're leaving, so that's good. Then we shouldn't take her with us. We keep our word. A nice evening. Come back! My daughter! Was there anyone at the party who can testify? No nobody. Sir, can you help me? I've been waiting here for three hours. There are people who wait longer. Is that right? What do you need? My daughter has been kidnapped. How do you know she's been kidnapped? - We paid, but she's not back. - Who paid you? The kidnappers. Do you have proof that they were kidnappers? They said they were part of the cartel. How do you know she's not working with them? - My daughter is not a criminal. - These are routine questions. When did you last see her? Six days ago. Why didn't you come sooner? You waited too long. Now the situation is much more complicated. Yes. But some people wait longer because they are afraid. Sir, I need help. I ask you as a mother. Ma'am, stop! Stand still! Can't you see if someone is innocent? - You can't come here! - Romero! - Let her through. - Yes sir. Sir, I need your help. My daughter's been kidnapped and the police does nothing. What you are doing is very dangerous. What happened? I don't know. It was two youths in a bright red SUV. We paid, but she's not back. Give her a card. This is the number for the descriptions. Go to your car, you are not allowed to stand here. We go. Laura? Who is this? Who is this? What do you want? Tell me what you want! The bodies of two young girls were dumped this morning on a busy city street, in front of passers-by on their way to work. The bodies had been tortured and beheaded. Although there are several tracks, the victims have not yet been officially identified. The remains are going to the morgue for research and are then transferred to the capital for an autopsy. The police started an investigation. - I'm looking for the manager. - There. I'm here for the headless girls. What do you want? I want to see the girls who have been recovered. - They were brought in here, but... - I need to see them. I can't show them without a permit. I think one of them is my daughter. All the more reason to talk to the people of the investigation. You must understand me. I have to be sure. I'm starting to think the worst things. Please... I hope I don't have any problems. Bodies to be examined shouldn't come here, but forensics keep saying they don't have room. They take advantage of that they say it's our civic duty. And what do we get in return? We collect the bodies... and have to wait for their instructions. But then they forget. along here. There are two heads, but only one body has been found. Is this your daughter? New. Come with me. - Where is she? I want to see her. - She's not. If it's not her, then why are you crying? It's just a misunderstanding. I thought she would be here. You make me come here, I prepared for the worst. - Why are you doing this to me? - Sir... Why are you doing this to me? You're crazy. Gustavo... Alma, stop that. Drink some water. Here. Thank you. What happened to your daughter? She's been kidnapped. Did you go to the police? Yes. Then I got terrible phone calls. I thought they knew... I don't know. I thought the worst. Yes... It's gotten really bad. I am also threatened. They come here with their demands. They have brought a body for me to prepare. They're coming to pick it up tomorrow. They want the most expensive chest. But who pays for that, do you think? Everything out of my pocket. And that has been going on for some time now. Always afraid they'll show up here. So you know who they are? New. They are many, always others. I don't ask questions. What are you going to do with those girls? Imagine how their mothers feel when they see them. Come on, fast! Careful, don't shake. Okay, get out now. How much do I owe you? 148 pesos. Thank you. - That's for Ceci. - Thank you, that's kind. Do you know that boy? That's my son. He was kidnapped from his school six months ago. Do you have any news about him? Have they contacted you? I haven't heard from him again. But I think he's still alive. My daughter was also kidnapped. We paid, but nothing. And the police? Have you talked to them? They haven't done anything. Nobody cares. I know you are being blackmailed. Help me stop them. They have to do with the disappearances. I don't know what you're talking about. You just paid them. I've seen it. Tell me who they are, what you know about them. You better go. Stop lying. We're in the same damn situation! Don't protect them! Do you want them to kill our children? What do you want from me? She has red hair. She leads a criminal gang. They call her Commander Inez. She says the rival cartel has my son. And now I have to pay her every month in exchange for protection. She has promised to let me know if she hears anything. Ma'am, we've come to hear what you want from us. Come out and we can talk. Madam! Come outside! Don't be afraid. Do you want me to come in? Come with me. That bitch is starting to flip. Help me! You can't just go in anyway. Good evening, ma'am. I'm Lieutenant Lamarque and this is Sergeant Robles. I'm sorry you have to experience this. Tell me what happened. I already did that, but you didn't do anything. There's a lot going on here and nobody wants to help me! They kidnapped my daughter and haven't brought it back yet. I get terrible phone calls and now this! What else needs to be done before you help someone? I've done some research. I have information. But if you're not going to help me, call your men back and go away! May I enter? And your husband? He no longer lives here. Good evening, ma'am. Apologies for the location, but we must be discreet. We only arrived here a few weeks ago. You know the area like the back of your hand. I think we can help each other. And your motivation is very strong. We are going to check your information on two conditions: never ask me a question and don't say anything to anyone about our collaboration. I just want my daughter back. I understand your distrust of the local authorities. But as I've told you, that is not allowed here. If we are discovered it ends badly for both of us. Anything else... You know things can get bad? If something happens to me... may you leave me and say I was one of them. I see we understand each other. - The food there is very good! - That's true. We were there last week. Very tasty. A woman's making tortillas in the middle of the restaurant. We have been well received. But it was strange... They offered us broccoli soup. We thought, good to start. For main course they had: chicken with broccoli, broccoli gratin, broccoli pie, beef in broccoli sauce, broccoli puree... We laughed and... I asked them why this fascination with broccoli. Appeared that a truckload of broccoli had overturned on the outskirts of the village because the drug lords had thrown nails into the road. We go to another restaurant, same thing: nothing but broccoli. And everyone was happy. It reminded me of a village near my home, in the mountains. A small village on the mountainside, along which runs a road with a very dangerous bend, known for the accidents that happen. For years, the village benefited from those accidents. When a truckload of pigs overturned, the whole village was a party. If it was a cement truck, everyone would remodel their kitchen floor or patio. If it were washing machines, even poor people without clothes had the very latest washing machine. But because of the drug lords the truck drivers don't take that road anymore. And everyone is disappointed. I think she's here shouldn't be so happy or sad there. Broccoli... - There they are. - Where? There. The one in front is called Inez. She leads a group of kidnappers and blackmailers. They say she is very cruel. The other is called Meche. They are almost always together. I have pictures of all their gang. Let's take a look. C-20, C-52. Back up, hands on your head! Lieutenant, they say they clean houses. Is that right? Do you clean with machine guns? Or what? Wouldn't that be easier... with a mop or a brush? I think then. Or with their hair. Okay. Tell me, cleaning ladies, what are you doing out so late with those guns? We went to the pharmacy. I'm on my period and don't feel well. Damn say... And do you need machine guns to buy sanitary pads? The weapons are not ours. And then? The van belongs to a neighbor. I get it, you should have started with that. That changes everything. And frankly, I believe you. They look... like nice girls, huh? That is obvious. Anyway, I'm looking for a girl and I thought maybe you guys could help me with that. What are you talking about? I'm talking about kidnapping extortion and torture. Lieutenant, there are two cars looking for them. It seems your boyfriends are already looking for you. This is going to be fun. Give me a picture. - Robles. - Yes sir. Let me see. This is her. New? Look. Do you want to save yourself this... or not? We will file a complaint with the Human Rights Commission! Dirty bitch! Which rights? Why are you looking for her? So you're asking the questions now? Leave her alone, you bastard! Shut up! Don't worry, they'll talk. Lieutenant, those sluts say we're in the area. Understood. Stoop! To get off! Ma'am, stay here! Forward, forward! Come on! Madam, hide! Bring the girls. Bring them out! Head down! Barrage, head down! Watch out, in the stands! Cover the lieutenant! Take cover! Take cover! Secure the perimeter! Take cover! Back cover! Stoop! Man down! Protect him! Get up, you bastard! Your information better be correct, you bastards! I don't know anything. Guard him! Check the environment! How many victims? Inside there are two more that are alive. Bring them here. forward! - Come outside! - Forward! Check every room, I want them all! Find the weapons! Hands up, motherfucker! Come with me! Get him out of there! Ma'am, you can't be here. Bring him out! A victim here, a girl! She needs urgent care, call Robles! We come out with a body. Calm down... everything will be fine. Have you seen her? Her name is Laura. Don't worry, we're going to call your parents. Do you know their number? Calm down. I'm going to see what happens. Stay here, I'll be right back. Now then, motherfuckers. And you, the cleaning ladies? The night is over for you. Wait. I just follow orders. We had to clean the grounds... Don't worry, ma'am. - Everything is under control. - Wait! Come with me. You scared me. What are you doing here? I tried to call you. The neighbors had told me about the car. What have you done? I asked what you did. I see your burnt-out car here. The house is a mess, bullet holes everywhere... I thought something happened to you. Indeed. Something can also happen to me at any time. Yes. I was worried. I'm sitting here waiting, with no news. And? I don't want to talk about it with you. What have you done? I've been looking for Laura. Have you been looking for her? Where? By doing what? Hey? On the street. Everywhere. Listen, please. I'm not here for what happened. I want to talk with you. Talk about what happens to us. This nightmare. And... I've thought a lot. I want to be here, with you. Support you. Support each other. And that suddenly occurs to you? You have guts. I'm going to find her. I'm not going to sit here and wait for her with you. You have a right to be mad, but I want you to know that Rosy is over. It is over. I said my place is here. Didn't she let you down because you're out of money? She hates Laura. Who knows, she might have something to do with it. What are you saying? Where is she? - I want to speak to her. - I don't know. She is gone. She doesn't want to see me anymore, what can I do? I just want my daughter back. Me too. Then we agree on that. Now go home. And then? Go home, I said. Damn. This is also my house. What? This hasn't been your house for a long time. I want you to leave. Are you sure? - Bye, Lupe. - How are you, Cielo? Bye, sweetheart. I need a favor. Can I borrow your car? - I can not do that. - Why, are you going to use it? No, but Alfredo decides on that. Please. I have to go to court. For Laura's case. - I want to go with her. - No that is not possible. That is not possible. I don't want to leave my sister alone. My sister... That won't work. forward. Don Quique, let me go with her. Dona Cielo. Hey. How are you, Don Quique? Good. I'm doing some shopping. Are you throwing a party? New. But I don't want to go to the store too often. No news from Laura yet? Stop your search. Why do you say that? Because they are very bad people. Do you think she's still alive? Don't get me wrong, I'm on your side. But I'm worried about you. Believe me, I understand you. There is, of course, always hope. Do you remember Guerrero? The girls who were prostituted for years... and who could kill their captors and escape. Quick, Don Quique. I brought you something. Go get them. We are almost there. Upwards! Floor secured. On your knees, motherfucker! On your knees, hands behind your neck! Don't move! - No... - Shut up, you bastard! Yes, but don't hurt me. - Shut up! - Target secured, sir. Please don't hurt me. Good evening, Mr. Quique. - Do you know why we are here? - New. We want the names of your contacts and know what to do with their hostages. I'm just a shopkeeper, sir. - I have a shop... - We know that. I just help them sometimes, sir. I do the shopping and give them advice. I didn't kidnap anyone, I swear. - Advice? - Yes. Because I know the village and its inhabitants well. That's all. what do you know of the other shopkeeper's daughter? Which has disappeared. Laura? They had been watching her for a long time. Hit him. Save the necessary information from him. New. I will cooperate, sir. New. - You pointed her out, you bastard. - No, wait... New... Asshole! Where is my daughter? - Dona Cielo? - Where is she? What have they done to her? - We are old friends. - I'm not your girlfriend! We've known each other for so long. Why are you doing this? I know where they're holding her. I know that. She has been kidnapped by a certain El Puma. He has everything planned. I can give you... I can take you there. Please... Stand up! Get up, you bastard! forward! We come out with the package! Perimeter clear, sir. forward! Madam. Ma'am, let's go. You dirty bastard. You really think we're crazy. - I am talking to you! - Yes sir. What, yes sir? Where the hell are they? No idea. They were still here this morning. I've been really nice to you, you piece of shit. - Yes sir. - Yes what? Do√±a Cielo, tell them not to kill me. Say we're friends. Where is my daughter? Please, you don't understand. What am I not understanding? Laura and El Puma know each other. Rumor has it that she rejected him. That was her fault. I couldn't do anything. Dirty Bastard. So now it's my daughter's fault? bastard! I can help you. I know things, they trust me. I can help you from within. Give information. I couldn't help but work for them. My son had problems with loan sharks, I needed money quickly. They buried people here. There... I know many things, I really do. There, back. Hence the balaclava. You cut your hair. It suits you, I like it. You've never had it so short. I had this haircut before I met you. Piping hot, just the way you like it. It looks much better on you, you look younger. I've always liked short hair, like Vikki Carr. Tell me Tell me everything, forever Don't be afraid, dear... Aren't you going to work? I took this morning off to have breakfast together. - Your phone. - Must be a supplier who wants his money. Excuse me. Yes? That's me. Damn it, Quique... What happened? Please... I'll pay for everything. Give him a dignified, honorable burial. His son is in the US, undocumented. He won't be able to come back to say goodbye. Why did they kill him? Who harmed that poor old man? And just when he was about to go to his son in the United States. He said that was the worst thing that could happen to him. That old fool. He always complained that everything happened at the wrong time. He was a good friend. I don't understand how everything has become such a mess. First Laurita, who is taken from us just like that. Then Lisandro, no idea why he ended up in jail. And now Quique. What happened to Lisandro? Didn't I say that? His mother has come to the store. She needed help because her son was in trouble. What kind of problems? I don't know, I didn't really listen. We have too many problems of our own to concern ourselves with those of others. We'll never see her again, will we? These roads are under their control. All this area. - If they see us, we're screwed. - We have no choice. If we don't do it, nobody will. The person who helped me said it was here. That person... should have said how dangerous this is. We shouldn't be here. We go? If anyone sees us, police, military, cartel, we're in the shit. - Did you find something? - I don't know yet. Give here. Give here. - And? - Several graves, one of which is recent. There are about fifty bodies. And you are? She and her husband found the graves. Hello Miss. I'm Agent Perez. Hey. Why don't you go home? We take care of everything here. What is going to happen now? With what? With the bones. As usual. What's as usual? We follow protocol. The remains are entered into the database to see if the DNA matches that of a missing person. Why? My daughter has disappeared. And how long will that take? About two to four months. Excuse me. PEDESTRIAN ACCESS Hey. I'm going to sleep well tonight. Open the door. No touching and no passing. Mrs Cielo. What happened, Lisandro? Nothing. I got caught with guns. With weapons? I never doubted you. But when I see you now that i see you here i have to ask you: do you have anything to do with Laura? - Do you know something? - It's not what you think. I have nothing to do with it I swear. I love Laura, I'd rather die than hurt her. I joined the others, the rival cartel. While I was doing chores for them, I was trying to get info on Laura. I couldn't just sit and wait, I had to do something. Over the past few weeks I have... seen and done terrible things. You have no idea. I hate them. I swear I'll finish them all. If you know anything, tell me. Whatever. I'm looking for Lety Lopez. These are for her. lety. This is for you. Thank you. Bye. Madam! Who do they come from? Move aside, ma'am. I'm sorry, ma'am, the lieutenant has been transferred. We'll pick him up That's all we can do. But I have to question him. No movement! Why me? I did not do anything! Mom! I did not do anything! This is a mistake! Don't worry, Mom. Let him go. You can't take my son. Why are you taking him? bastards. Let him go. What did he do? What did he do? Help me please. - Let him go! - My son! Move on, move on. Don't do this, don't take my son, I beg you! My boy. Please. I think that's all. - Here's 2,500. - Thank you. I know it's hard. We have to wait for the DNA results. And have confidence. We can do no more. You? I don't want to talk to her. - You have not been asked. - I have rights. You have no business here. I've come to see if you're still somewhat human. If you've been thinking about anything since you've been stuck here. And you, are you satisfied? You got me where you wanted. You have wronged me. I want you to tell me exactly what happened to my daughter. How can I know? You're already sitting here, why do you keep lying? What have you done with her? They found graves on your ranch. All your atrocities. Tell... are they going to find my Laurita there? If she's still alive, where is she? Did you kill her? Did someone else order you to? No, I didn't do anything. You signed a statement. Here you say you know Laura, that you gave her gifts because you liked her. You say you were a hawk. That you knew about the kidnappings and the murders. They forced me to sign. By the way, what is a "hawk"? I don't even know. I'm going to read it to you so you can recognize your own words: "I saw suspicious movements from the military and the police." - Is that right? - According to you. You had my daughter kidnapped. I didn't do anything, ma'am. You asked me for money for Laura! Here you say you extorted shops and farmers. Witnesses identified you. You must have paid those people. Are you so little man? For real? Look at me and lie to me like that? Suppose you didn't kill her. Then tell me what happened. So now I'm the right one? You spoke of a "daddy". I want to know his name. Did he order you to do this? - For the money? - No orders, I didn't do anything. Tell me! Who made you kidnap my daughter? Was it that traitor Quique? Did he designate us? Or was it Rosy Hernandez? She hated my daughter. Did she pay you for the job? You have too much imagination. I'd like to help you, but I don't know what you're talking about. Why are you protecting them? Do you think they care about you? They let you rot here. - You have a family out there. - Yes, a big and beautiful family. And God can find that family. God can find yours too. I think if you have a mother, you know what love is. And you threw all that away. God will punish you. For you accuse an innocent and you keep me away from my son. - Too bad you're bringing God into this. - And that you keep me here. God forbid, if anything happens to you tomorrow, you'll think of me. You think something will happen to me. Only God knows that. I thought you'd have a little more courage... what humanity. I feel sorry for your son. Hey. I am Mrs. Guti√©rrez and this is Araceli Garcia, the psychologist. Hey. I don't like to bring this kind of news, but I have to inform you that the analysis of the human remains that the authorities found in the graves at the ranch has shown... I'm afraid a rib matches her DNA. We are here to support you. A rib? My daughter wasn't just a rib. Where's the rest? All the remains have been analyzed and unfortunately only one rib matches. New. No that is not possible. Ma'am, it's in the report. I'm really sorry, there's nothing we can do about it. Ma'am, I'm sorry. I know this situation is very difficult. But the results are there. This rib can help you close a chapter and say goodbye to your daughter with a funeral. You will receive the remains in a few days so that you can arrange her funeral. I want all my daughter back! You must keep digging! Ma'am, you are right. But you must understand that your daughter is no longer with us. Give it some time. It's a lot to process. We can't do anything. We must be strong. Together. That is not true. We could have done something. And you know that. How can you live like this? It's always the same with you. "That's life." It's never you. Never your fault. And you want us to be strong? Now? In this tragedy? Now that she's gone? I can not do that. Sorry. I'll leave them here. Good... Bye. An extraordinary girl, honest and sensible, who never put her personal interests above reason, and that had conquered all our hearts. I speak on behalf of everyone, we are going to miss her. We will remember her fondly, with a smile on our faces, as she would have liked. In the name of the Father, the son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
