[ Classical music playing ] Good. Come on, Polly. Come on, go. Hey, Paul. - Hey, Julianne. How was your ride? - Terrific, thanks. Good. Listen, Michael has been trying to find you. He called over here a couple of times. Yeah, we're supposed to go out. I gotta go change. I'm looking a little grubby. Come on, you always look great on a horse. I fell in love with you the first time I saw you on one. I was 12 years old. I didn't look so great. I kept falling off. Yeah, but you were still beautiful when you were falling. Go back and fix your fence. Come on, Polly. Come on, girl. Yeah, Polly. Trouble, come here. Oh, that's my boy. Kitty cat, how are you? You want down, huh? You want down? [ People chatting ] It's almost 7:00. Where have you been? Riding. Didn't Anna tell you? She must have forgotten. It's a madhouse in the kitchen-- the pastry chef quit. Two waiters called in sick. Maybe you should work tonight. Anna's a reliable manager. She can handle it. Besides, we're supposed to be at Tom and Susan's in a half hour. Michael, do I have to go? Julianne, you've missed their last two parties. They're going to think you don't like them. They don't like me. They just tolerate me because they're your friends. Well, you know they like you. - You just have to be friendlier. - Yes, but I just-- please hurry. We're getting a reputation for being late. Okay. Are you sure this dress looks okay? Come on, darling. It looks terrific on you. Julianne, you look beautiful as always. All: Surprise! Happy birthday! Thanks. - Man: Come on in. - Happy birthday, Julianne. - I think she is. - You look surprised. You do look surprised. - Happy birthday, Julianne. - Thank you. Hey, Michael. - Happy birthday. - Thanks. Another year, kiddo. Don't remind me. You know I hate birthdays. Oh, surely there must be at least one you liked. No, never. Well, maybe this will be the one. Thanks for coming. Congratulations. So were you surprised? Yes, very, Susan. And we have a surprise for you too, Michael. You made this month's cover. Really? I browsed through the newsstand. I must have missed it. And we reviewed the restaurant. There's even a picture of you in there. Let me see. - Let's see if we can find that. - There you go, - in the bar. - Not a bad-looking guy. It's-- it's nice, Susan. It's nice. How about that? We made the cover. Susan: It's quite an honor. Woman: How long will you need the car, Mr. Lloyd? - I'm not sure. - Well, we have a special if you'd like-- just-- just charge me by the day. Julianne. Yeah, he does. Thank you. Excuse me. Julianne? Are you all right? How could Michael have done this to me? He knows how uncomfortable things like this make me feel. Well, I thought that Tom and Susan were your good friends. No, they're his good friends. I guess I was hoping that it would just be Michael and me. It seems we hardly have any time together. Oh, I guess you two wanna be alone. Happy birthday. Darling? Oh god, Michael. How did you know? I just took a wild guess. I'm never gonna trust Anna again. - I just looked at it. - I know. Four times. Thank you. I love it. Michael. Michael. What's wrong, Julianne? Could you turn out the light please? Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. [ Ringing ] Hello? Man: Is Richard Martin there? No, you must have the wrong number. There's no Richard Martin here. I'm sorry. Thank you. I'm sorry. We're completely booked that weekend. Well, I can put you on a waiting list, but I can't guarantee anything. All right, bye-bye. - How's it going? - Fantastic. The phone hasn't stopped this morning. We're full for the weekend. It must be that article in "town and travel." Yeah. Good morning, Albert. - Good morning, Mr. Wakefield. - Albert. - Yes, sir? - Your tie. I'm sorry, sir. How did we do last night? I don't have all the numbers, but I think pretty good. Have you seen "town and travel"? Michael: Mm-hmm. Tom and Susan's. - Good morning, honey. - You're up early. - Phone woke me. Good morning, Anna. - Who called? Wrong number. By the way, where did they get that picture of me? Tony-- he searched the files until he found a picture of you. - He thought you'd like it. - Thanks. Well, you tell him if he ever does it again, he's fired. I thought he was doing the right thing. Just tell him to ask first. Anna: Okay. By the way, the florist called. He said he can't do the arrangements for $250 a week anymore. He's raising US to $300. - $300 a week for flowers. - Michael: He's crazy. I know, I told him, but he said the growers raised him, so I couldn't really argue. Next time i'm in the city I'll just stay on an extra day and look for a new florist. Well, maybe I can help. You know, I grow a lot of the same flowers in the garden. You know how much I love making flower arrangements. Thank you, darling. That's very sweet of you, but it's an enormous responsibility, and I hate to burden you with it. - Yes, but i-- - Michael. - There's a call for you. - Thanks. Hello? Man: Is this Michael Wakefield? Yes, who is this? Michael Wakefield from Chicago? No. No, you've got the wrong person. Sorry. - I have to get into town. - Now? Yeah, I've gotta get something to the post office. Could I get anything for you? Could you do me a favor and stop by the nursery? They're holding some petunias for me. - Sure. - Thanks. - [ Clicks, dings ] - Woman: Operator. Yes, operator, I would like to make a collect call to area code 312 555-1824. Your name please? My name is Michael Wakefield. - Thank you. One moment. - [ Rings ] - Man: Hello? - Mr. Cooper. Yeah, I just received the newspaper. - Good. - Yes, I have, but I just wanted to make sure that everything was... - All right. - Everything is fine. Just wanted to make sure you were up to date. Thank you. Yeah, you'll let me know if anything changes. - I certainly will. - Okay. [ Line disconnects ] How long will you be staying with US, Mr. Lloyd? I'm not sure. Is there anything else you require, sir? - No, nothing. - Thank you. Enjoy your stay. No. Lloyd: I thought it looked beautiful. Julianne: Oh, thank you. You grow them yourself? Yes, I do. Eric Lloyd. Um, Julianne Wakefield. Wakefield? Is your father the owner? Was. Now it's my husband. So that was your husband's picture in the magazine? - Yeah. - You look young enough to be his daughter. Oh, hardly. [ Chatting in distance ] [ Door shuts ] Anna. Has Michael come back yet? I haven't seen him. He's been gone a long time. He probably stopped off at one of his favorite antique dealers. - Don't worry. - Excuse me, Anna. - Can I see you for a moment please? - Yeah, excuse me. Is everything all right, Mrs. Wakefield? You look upset. Oh, I'm fine. I'm just waiting for my husband. While you're waiting, would you care to join me for a glass of wine? Oh, no. I mean, no thank you. I'd better get upstairs, in case he's trying to call. Excuse me. Oh no. No! [ Phone ringing ] Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Wakefield. No! Ma'am, they found the car, but they haven't found his body. - Well, then maybe he's still alive. - It's highly unlikely. My men are scouring the shoreline. Later this afternoon they'll drag the bottom of the river, but the currents in that river are treacherous, and we may never find his body. Ma'am. We're so sorry, Julianne. The doctor gave her something. She's devastated. Well, she's not staying alone, is she? No, I'm gonna stay here for a while. If there's anything we can do, please call. - Thanks, sue. Thanks for coming. - Come on, baby. Julianne. Julianne, I came as soon as I heard. I just can't believe this has happened. I'm glad you came, Paul. Julianne? Julianne, are you all right? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I couldn't sleep so I came in here last night. Michael always liked this room. Come on, eat some breakfast. You didn't eat anything yesterday. I'm not hungry. You have to eat. Please. Okay. [ Gasps ] Oh my. I was waiting to see Mrs. Wakefield. She's not up to visitors now. Are you a friend of hers? We met the other day. I just heard about the terrible tragedy. What happened? His car blew a tire, went over a cliff into the river. I'm terribly sorry. Please give Mrs. Wakefield my condolences. Of course. Michael. "Richard Martin"? Julianne. Julianne, you are going to lose everything unless you start to take care of business. Michael mortgaged this place to the hilt when the renovation got out of control. Now with Michael gone, the banks are getting nervous. They want to call in the loans. Listen to me. Your grandparents built this inn. Now you're the only one that can go in there and convince them that it can survive without Michael. I can't. I can't do it without him. You're gonna have to. You're just gonna have to. [ Footsteps receding ] [ Honks ] Julianne. [ Honks ] Man: There is a life insurance policy, but with no body the carrier won't pay until we petition the courts and he's declared legally dead. The courts are slow. It could take up to six, maybe nine months. I spoke with the president of the bank. They're not prepared to wait that long. What about my stocks? My father's investments? - The money my grandmother left me. - Gone. When you inherited the inn, you put it into Michael's name. He was a very nice man, but not a great businessman. You don't put $300,000 into renovating an old inn, not in this day and age, not in this town. $300,000? It wasn't supposed to cost that much. It actually cost $350,000. But how? You gave him power of attorney when you married him. I assumed he told you what he was doing. I don't know where to begin. The bank wants some answers. I didn't even know where the checkbook was. I don't even know where the tax returns are. There's a filing cabinet in the back of that closet. Michael kept everything in there. The keys are in the tray in the bottom drawer. Why didn't Michael tell me anything? He didn't think you were interested in the business. I should have known these things. I'm sure the last thing that Michael ever wanted was for you to be going through this. I'm so confused. I don't know what Michael was doing with our lives. I've got to get back to the kitchen. Anna. What's this doing here? That's Michael's gun. He always kept it for protection. Why didn't he tell me? He knew how you felt about guns. He probably just didn't want you to be frightened. Okay? [ Horse whinnying ] Polly, what is it? What is it? Whoa. Whoa now. Come inside. Come on, boy. Whoa! Come on, we're going inside. Come on. Come on. Whoa. [ Yells ] Julianne! Julianne! Whoa. Whoa. Take it easy. Whoa. Whoa, come on. Get over here. Come on, let's go. Let's go. [ Groans ] Come on, get over here. That's right. Get get! - Julianne, are you all right? - Yes. - Come on. - Ow. - What's the matter? - I twisted it. Come on, I'll help you. Julianne, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just get the horse in the barn please. Okay, don't worry about it. Come on. Come on, come on. Hurry up. Hurry up. Good boy. Come on. Here you go. No no no. Time to go to sleep. [ Screams ] You have to swear not to tell anyone I'm here. Oh god, Michael. You're alive. We thought you were dead. - What happened? - I was able to get out of the truck. Oh no, you're hurt. I better get you to a hospital. No no, I'll be all right. Look at that wound. My god, you need a doctor. No, no doctor. But what happened? What are you hiding? I can't tell you. Just trust me. - No one can know I'm here. - Okay okay. Upstairs. Okay, be careful. Hang on.Hang on. Hey there. I thought you could use these. They're lovely. Thanks. So how's the ankle today? - Much better. - Good. You gonna be able to save any of this? - Looks like I'll have to replant most of it. - That's too bad. I know how much your gardening means to you. Used to. Now it doesn't seem very important. You know, I realized last night that I never asked Michael any questions. I went through his desk and found a gun. I didn't even know he had one. Oh, yeah. Well, you knew he went hunting, didn't you? Hunting? Yeah, he was always trying to convince me what a great sport-- Michael hunted. Wait wait, come here. Whoa. I'm sorry. Maybe I shouldn't have told you. It's okay. Michael. Michael, it's me. Oh, Michael. - I have to get you to a doctor. - No. I think it's getting infected. - We'll just put some antiseptic on it. - I brought some. Come over here. Come on, lean on me. Was Julianne hurt last night? No, she's okay. It was just a sprain. Well, you have to get her to a doctor. Michael, what is going on? No, just do what I tell you. Bring me some clothes and a blanket, and give me as much cash as you can. As soon as I'm stronger, I have to leave. Where are you going? Who are you running from? Michael, what's going on? What about Julianne? Look, if you won't tell me, you should tell her. She's your wife. She has the right to know. It's best that she believes I'm dead. This is crazy. Just do what I ask, huh? Excuse me, Mr. Lloyd, your long-distance call is ready. Thank you. - The phone's right over there. - Thank you. [ Rings ] - Yeah? - Cooper: Hello, Mr. Lloyd. It appears that Michael Wakefield has had a convenient accident. I plan to stay around awhile and see what happens. You will, of course, let me know if the deceased Mr. Wakefield contacts you. Yes, I will. Yeah. I'm sorry. I should have knocked, but I found these in the door. Oh, thank you. I must have left them there. I'm just clearing away some of Mr. Wakefield's things. It's too painful for Julianne. It must be. Can I help you? They were a beautiful couple. Yes, they were. I used to know a Wakefield in Boston. Did he have any family from there? I don't know. I think he was from the midwest. That's right. It wasn't Boston. It was Chicago. Of course, I used to know a Richard Wakefield there. Maybe they were brothers. I don't think that Mr. Wakefield had any brothers or sisters. - Maybe a cousin. - Yeah, maybe. Well, I better not bother you anymore. - It looks like you have work to do. - Yes. Thanks. $5,000? - Any luck? - No. Me neither. According to these invoices we were buying at least 15 cases a month, but there's not a bottle in the place. I have been here six months. We have never had chardonnay from the Julio winery. Do me a favor. Check the store room one more time. Maybe we missed it. If you want me to, I will, but I'm sure we won't find any. Just double-check. Did you find any? No, I think I'll take a ride up there, and see if I can figure it out. No, you don't have to bother. I can telephone in the morning. Thanks, but I feel like a drive. Why don't I come with you? It's a long way. - I'll be fine. - You don't even know where it is. Of course I do. I grew up here. - [ Knocking ] - Hello? Hello? Hello. Is Mr. and Mrs. Julio home please? Woman: What is it, Katie? - Mrs. Julio? - Yes. Hello, i'm Julianne Wakefield. From the Wakefield inn. Oh, yes. Please... come in. Sweetie, go play outside. Would you like some tea? Yes, thank you. I was going through the books and I found these checks made out to your winery. But when I looked around the inn I couldn't find any wine, so I was hoping maybe you could explain them. Your husband is a very kind and generous man. I don't think we could have survived without him. My children can hardly wait till he arrives. Billy, that's my oldest, is extremely attached to him. It's been three years since his daddy walked out. My husband was killed in a car accident. [ Baby crying ] I-- would you excuse me? It's all right. [ Sobbing ] It's okay. It's okay. Oh, god. Oh my god. Okay. Oh, god. Okay. Shh shh shh. Okay. Oh, god. Shh shh shh. It's okay. [ Sobbing ] You knew about the baby, didn't you? No. Don't lie to me, Anna. It's humiliating enough. You seem to know about everything else that goes on around here. Michael loved you. He never wanted to hurt you. Hurt me? That's an odd choice of words for this moment, don't you think? Julianne. [ Galloping ] Julianne. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Come on, talk to me here. What? I feel like a fool. For five years I trusted and I loved Michael. I thought I knew him, but now I'm finding things out about him I can't believe. It's like he was a stranger. Oh god. Come on. It's okay. It's all right. It's gonna be okay. Hell of a mess, huh? - And the body? - Haven't found it yet. What are the odds of survival? None. Wouldn't the body have washed ashore by now? He could have been caught underwater in the rocks. He could have been swept out to sea. But until there's a body, there's no way to prove that he's dead. You insurance guys, you're all the same. Thanks for your time. Yeah. Good morning, Mrs. Wakefield. Good morning, Albert. Albert. - Yes, ma'am? - Your tie. Sorry, ma'am. - Anna, do you have a minute? - Mm-hmm, of course. I was thinking that I'd like to have a memorial service for Michael. Do you think that's appropriate? They haven't found the body yet. Michael had a lot of friends. I thought it would be a nice thing to do. Well, it is nice, but I think you should wait a while. No. I think I have to do it so I can get on with my life. Why don't you just think about it? I have. It's what I wanna do. I can't believe Katherine would say anything. I don't know how Julianne found out, but when she asked me, I couldn't lie to her. How is she? Anna, how is she? My god, Michael. How do you think she is? She's angry, she's hurt, she's betrayed. Another woman had your child. She wants to get on with her life. She's gonna have a memorial service for you. Does everyone believe I'm dead? - Yes. - Good. - I want it that way. - What about Julianne? I love her. I didn't mean to hurt her. If I could just make her understand that I didn't mean to get involved with Katherine. [ Gasps ] Mr. Lloyd. What are you doing out here so late? I thought I'd get some fresh air. It's a beautiful night, isn't it? Yes, it is. How is Mrs. Wakefield doing? Well, it was a terrible tragedy. It's been difficult for all of US. I think she's doing better. Did they ever find the body? No. You know, Mr. Lloyd, it's unusual for a guest to stay as long as you have. May I ask you why? I'm researching my new book. [ Horse nickering ] - [ Clatters ] - [ Cat meows ] [ Horse whinnying ] [ Groans, grunts ] [ Talking softly ] We've never met, Mrs. Wakefield. Your husband and I worked on the committee together to stop the new development. Michael and I were the only two that refused to sell. Sell what? The property across the lake. Yours and mine. Oh, yes. It was a lovely service, Julianne. He's going to be deeply missed by a lot of people. Yeah, I know. Everyone loved him. Thanks, Charlie. Thank you, Susan. If there's anything at all we can do, please call. Julianne: Thank you for coming. My condolences, Mrs. Wakefield. Thank you. Sorry, Julianne. - I'm sorry. - Thanks for coming. - So sorry. - Thank you. Thank you. [ Sobbing ] Do you want some company or do you prefer to be alone? I could use the company. Look, if you need a shoulder, I'm here. I don't know if I want to cry or scream. Probably a little of both. I'm just glad this is finally over. And thank you for being my friend. I'll always be here for you, Julianne. You know that. Okay, all right, guys. Okay, let's go to the left here. Your lawyer called. He said 2:00 will be fine. - Yeah. - Want me to go with you? No, thank you. The terrace looks nice. Julianne: Yeah, I thought we could use some plants out here, soften it up a little bit. It looks good. Maybe the tables are a little close together. It just makes it cozy. There's plenty of room. Maybe you're right. Yeah, could we move the hibiscus into the sun a little bit more? I wanna make sure it gets enough. I looked at the land on the other side of the lake and decided to call the developer. They wanna buy it. Well, selling off half your land is pretty radical, Julianne. I don't think I have a choice. I've gone through the books and with the debts from the construction, and the money we owe the banks-- Michael was opposed to the development. He felt it would spoil the community. I don't know if it will help or hurt this community. All I know is I can't lose the inn that has been in my family for years. And the only way I know how to keep it is to sell off part of my land. Yes, this is Mrs. Michael Wakefield. I think there's been a mistake. Yes, I'll wait. It's past 4:00 and you haven't eaten all day. Thank you, Anna, but I would like to take my meals - downstairs from now on. - Okay. - Just trying to be helpful. - I appreciate it. Oh, before I forget-- the bank is sending over an appraiser - to look at the property across the lake. - What for? I'm selling it for the new subdivision. You can't do that. Michael-- it is the easiest and fastest way I know to pay off all the debts. But Michael was against development there. Michael is dead. Just a minute, Anna. Yes? Are you sure? I'll be there tomorrow. [ Phone clicks ] Do you know about this? - The Montgomery street club? - Mm-hmm. Michael wasn't a member there. It must be a mistake. Not according to their computer. Why would Michael belong to a club in town? That's what I'm going to find out. [ Sighs ] Man: Your husband has been a member of this club for almost three years. What I'm trying to tell you is it's a mistake. You must have the wrong Michael Wakefield. - We don't live here. - I know. And you've newly remodeled your inn. Look, my husband traveled a lot, but I know he didn't come into the city that often. About twice a month, around the 7th and the 25th, and always stays a few days. But Michael wouldn't belong to a place like this. - Your husband-- - my husband was killed. Oh. I'm terribly sorry. This is a key to the room your husband didn'thave here in case you would like to check it out, and see if anything looks familiar. Room? Some of our members keep rooms here. The room is upstairs. Second door on the left. Damn you! Damn you! Damn you! Damn you! Damn you! Michael, Michael. Oh god. Oh god. B. Madigan? Ostin incorporated, may I help you? - Mr. Madigan, please. - Yes, he is. Could you hold a moment please? - Ostin incorporated? - Mr. Madigan please. B. Madigan through the bullpen turn left. Yes, thank you for holding. I'm Barbara Madigan. What can I do for you? You wanted to see me about an investment? Yeah. Yes. I have some stocks that I want to sell. A mutual friend of ours suggested that I see you. Barbara: And? Julianne: He evidently thought very highly of you. You made several investments for him. I don't mean to be rude, but I don't know who you're talking about. Maybe this will help. It seems you did more than make a few investments for my husband. I-- uh, I don't know what you mean. Oh, I think you do. I found this in the room that you and my husband kept. Michael never told me he was married. Well... It seems we were both deceived. How did you find out? By accident. Does Michael know? Michael's dead. Excuse me. Thanks for coming, Paul. Well, I'm glad you called me. So how are you? How are you doing? I'm numb. I don't feel anything anymore. When I walked out of her office, all I could think about was seeing you. I just wanted it to be like it was when we were kids. Yeah? Well, I have an idea of how we can do that. - What? - Come on. Where are we going? Well, if you get up, I'm gonna take you away from all of this. Now come on, let's go. Come on. Come on, let's go. I'm coming. Okay, I'm coming. [ Classical music playing ] [ Silent ] [ Music continues ] Did you know about Michael's friends? No. Would you tell me if you did? I could never lie to you, Julianne. Wait. Are you sure you wanna go in there? This room? Yes. We can go somewhere else, you know. No. Keep the light on. I wanna see you. - What time is it? - It's after 11:00. - And she didn't call? - No. Well, where the hell is she? I told you. She left for the city earlier this morning. How could you let her go alone? Why didn't you go with her? She didn't want me to. Well, you should have insisted. She can't drive that far alone. She can't. Michael, she's not a child. She's a grown woman. A different woman than she was, and she made it very clear that she was gonna go by herself. My god, she's gonna find out about Barbara. Well, you should have though about that before you got involved. No no no, you don't understand. Julianne made it easy for me. She never questioned me about my travels. I went whenever I wanted. [ Man and woman laughing ] Look, Michael, I can't do this anymore. I can't go on lying for you and hiding you. How do you expect me to when you won't even tell me who's after you or why you're hiding? I can't tell you. I deceived Julianne about Katherine. I deceived her about Barbara. Now you want me to go on deceiving her about you? I can't do it. I just won't. Eric Lloyd wants to kill me. Why? For something that happened a long time ago... In Chicago. - I'll call the police. - No. No, besides, what good would that do? - Eric hasn't done a thing. - You can't hide forever. I'm gonna leave here soon. Where are you going to go? I don't know, but please, Anna, I want you to do something for me. I want you to call a man, a man named Mr. Cooper. I'll give you his number have you got a pencil? Who's Mr. Cooper? Please just do as I ask, Anna. Tell Mr. Cooper that Michael Wakefield is in trouble and will contact him as soon as he can. And tell him to start making new arrangements. And Anna... Don't tell him where I am. Cooper: Hello? - Mr. Cooper? - Yes? Yes, I'm calling for Michael Wakefield. Yes. He asked me to call you and tell you that he's in trouble and he'd like you to start to make new arrangements for him. Where is he? I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to say, but he'll contact you as soon as he can. - Fine. - [ Line disconnects ] - Good night. - Good night. [ Ringing ] - Yeah? - Cooper: Mr. Lloyd, I'm glad I got you. - Hello, Mr. Cooper. - I've got some news. Where did the call come from? She wouldn't say. Well, it shouldn't be hard to find out. I appreciate you letting me know. Any time. Another. Whoa, don't go in yet. It's almost morning. Yeah, well, I know. That's the whole point. Come on, we don't have much time. [ Both giggling ] Come on. Are you okay? Are you all right? Wait wait, hold on. Let's see this. [ Bottle clatters ] What's wrong? Nothing. I thought I heard something in the barn. Well, I didn't hear anything. Are you all right? Sometimes I get this feeling like Michael's still here. I think most people who have lost someone close to them feel like that. I get this feeling he's still alive. It's gonna take time. [ Knocking ] Coming! [ Knocking continues ] Just a minute. All right, I'm coming. Julianne, I've been so worried about you. When did you get back? You don't need to check up on me. Julianne, I've got to talk to you about Michael. Please, Anna, stop talking about Michael as if he's alive. - But Michael's not-- - [ Knocks ] Just a minute. - Mr. Lloyd. - What are you doing here? I think we need to have a little talk, ladies. - About what? - Your husband. What about my husband? He's hiding somewhere and I think you know where he is. Hiding? We don't know what you're talking about, Mr. Lloyd. You both know a lot more than you pretend. Now before things get nasty, I want to know the truth. My husband died in a car accident. You know that. - A very timely one, just after I came here. - It's true. You're good. You're very good. You almost had me convinced. Your husband was too smart. He knew the witness program wouldn't protect him. He figured Cooper could be bought for the right price. Witness program? Cooper? The name Cooper doesn't mean anything to you? Michael Wakefield is dead. The only time I believe that is when I put a bullet in him, something I should have done seven years ago before the bastard turned me in! Now last night, one of you two called Mr. Cooper, and told him that Richard-- excuse me-- Michael was in trouble and needed to make new arrangements. Was it you? I don't know what you're talking about. - Was it you? - No, I didn't. Oh god, no. Please leave him alone. Where is he? - I don't know. - Where is he?! He's in the barn. Quick, get Michael's gun. Quick! Get me the police. Quick! Stop or I'll shoot. If you move, I'll kill you. Let's go. You always knew he was alive, didn't you? He was here the whole time. Yes. Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to, but I couldn't. He made me promise. What? Was he scared I'd fall apart? That I couldn't handle it? He was frightened for your life. Why did Eric Lloyd wanna kill you? Revenge... For testifying against him. - I was granted immunity. - Immunity for what? For laundering money for Eric. I was a banker in Chicago. How did he find you? Cooper was my connection in the witness relocation program. He gave me a new identity, a new passport. Even a diploma from a high school in Arizona. He also was the only one who knew where to find me. When Eric was paroled, he obviously paid him a visit. Well, now what? Do you go back to Chicago and become Richard Martin? Do you stay here as Michael Wakefield? What? I can't go back to being Richard Martin. He doesn't exist anymore. And I can't stay Michael Wakefield. He doesn't seem to exist either. - And what about Julianne? - Oh, she'll be fine. She's proven she can survive without me. Michael, she deserves an explanation. I can't face her knowing the pain that I've caused her. You know, I used to think Julianne was lucky because she had you. Michael, I did everything that you asked of me, because you were my friend, because I trusted you. But you used me, just like you used Julianne, just like you used everybody. [ Footsteps receding ] I have to see him. He's still my husband. What-- what kind of husband, huh? The guy lies to you, he cheats on you. What is that? Maybe some of it's my fault. Maybe I acted too much like a little girl. Come on, Julianne. The guy's a fake. You can't just close your eyes and run away from the truth. You can't go back. People don't change. I have. What about US? I thought we had something here finally. I need some time. I have to sort things out. I don't wanna hurt you, but I can't commit to you or anyone else. Paul, I went from my father's house to Michael's house. I'm not gonna run away to another one until I can depend on myself. I need to be alone for a while... Find out who I am. I've never stopped loving you. I feel sorry for you, Michael. You'll never know what you missed. [ Blues music playing ]
