I am the owner of my karma. Heir to my karma. Born of my karma. Whatever I do, for good or evil to that I will fall heir. I know your eyes. This is not the first time we have met nor will it be the last. Stop right there! Wake up. Wake up, my child. You were talking in your sleep. Time to get up. Rise and shine. What's this? Your tea, grandma. Srey Leak, rent was due a few days ago. I thought your shop was supposed to pay our rent. Can you bring half tonight? Hey guys, I had another dream of my past life. - Again? - Better be something good this time. This dream was different. What did you see, exactly? A bunch of statues, but this one was definitely gold. Hear that, Mi? We're gonna find a treasure! You're always saying Leng Heng's dreams are full of shit. But he sees gold-- Dudes, I'm having a vision of my past life too. I was the king of Angkor! Son! There's a meeting at the village chief's and I want everyone to be there. Move it! You go around like everyone else. No shortcuts! Kids these days... BULLET TRAIN TO BEIJING All this talk of progress, of the future but you shove us out of the way, like we don't even exist. My family has lived in this neighborhood for three generations-- Ma'am, I assure you we are sympathetic to your family's situation. That's why we are offering to relocate you. Sir...your goddamn land concessions are kilometers outside the city. You are tearing this community apart-- Ma'am, I ask that you remain civil. We've offered your community generous compensation, but your protests have already cost us millions. This railroad you are building is bullshit. My husband is at war and you are letting... - Tell Mom I'll be home later. - ...this company steal our land-- Ma'am, Cambodia is not at war. If your husband took a salary to fight on behalf of a foreign power... Hey guys! Hey, what's up? You could throw a thousand times in a thousand lives, and still never hit it. They're splitting us up. By next year we won't even be friends. Why wouldn't we be friends, Thy? They're gonna tear down our houses to build some bullet train to China. So we really need to find this treasure. But where the hell do we start? What do you want, weirdo? Thy said he could get me a P2 chip if I had money. We're busy. Didn't I just say I have money? If we're going on an expedition, we'll need supplies. I know where we can get a shovel. What are you digging for? None of your damn business. Ok, whatever. I had a dream of my past life. There was treasure-- Damn, are you just gonna tell everyone? Where's it buried? Why do you care? I know how to find things. The last thing we need is some dirty orphan trying to take a cut. Leave her alone, Thy. She's just a girl. You can both back off, assholes. You said you had money! Nobody wants American dollars! I hope you brought me something good for all these beautiful hard drives. Brand new P2 chip. Hey man, wait for me! I'll bring you something good next time. I promise. Kids these days. Come on, Old Timer. The Russian will give me seven for the encrypted drive, plus a quarter of the bitcoin he'll probably find. -But you know I'd rather deal with you-- -Okay, okay. Deal. What the hell happened, Kosal? What? I packed you a bag before the landlord changed the locks. At least you have a change of clothes. I have my half of the rent. He gave me ten minutes. I couldn't even get my gear out. Understand? Just give me your half and we'll find a place to sleep tonight. -Where's your half? -Come on, let's go. You don't even have it, do you? Since you were little, I always tried to take care of you. I guess I'm not the best big brother. Khmer language Are you curious about your grandma? Doctor, can I rest? We're done. Just focus on that last photo while I cycle the device down. If the pills help her remember, why does she need to wear the hat? The medicine only lasts for a few hours, so we developed this device to permanently fix her memory. Pretty cool, eh? Doctor, would like to join us for porridge? I've got some time before I see my next granny. Sure, that would be lovely. She said yes. Girls, come eat. Have a seat. Little sister, have you taken a genuine interest in Buddhism? Or did you offer to do chores just to steal bananas from the offerings? Hey, Srey Leak! I need your help finding a treasure. Are you serious? You said you were good at finding things. Why don't your sandals match? I was playing with the guys here yesterday and one sandal disappeared. Which car? I already checked. It's not there. Let's go. I've seen the same statue in two dreams of two different past lives. I'm supposed to find it in this life too. I'm sure. If you say so. What are we doing out here anyway? Recognize anything? Everyone knows Uncle Sarath. No, dumbass. Look at the dogs. Maybe that one with the red collar? Maybe? Think it over. That's it! -How long have you lived here? -My whole life. And you never followed the dogs around? Everyone knows that red-collared bitch is a thief. And this is where she sleeps. See you around. What about my treasure? I got a job, kid. I can't work and investigate your treasure. I'll pay you. Right, sure you will. How much? We'll split the treasure. I want half. I already promised the guys a quarter each. Forty then. That leaves you each fifteen percent. Final offer. We'll need one of Thy's chickens. A chicken? Don't question my methods. You're getting fifteen percent of Leng Heng's treasure and all he's asking for is a single chicken. My take's down to fifteen percent? I got it! Here, try this. You need to work the pins one by one. Finesse. Try again. Hey dudes, check out my sweet moves! The more you screw around, the longer it takes! That's quite a racket, getting those boys to do all the work. Damn straight, Gramps. They actually think I can find this treasure. Hey, Leng Heng! Show him your book. I have these dreams sometimes, where I'm different people. Probably your past lives. Look here. This pagoda is on the north side of the city. But it's surrounded by skyscrapers now. Hey guys! Now they're never going to want to dig for junk again. Thanks a lot. So how are we splitting the money? We aren't. You just get your share of the treasure when we find it. Guys, she said there's no split. Investigations have expenses. That wasn't the deal...was it? Do you live around here? I used to have a shop with my brother. But he moved out. We probably won't live here much longer either. We're having soup for dinner. It's my grandma's recipe, and my sister always makes too much, so... I'm just going to read for a while. See you tomorrow. Ok, I'll go. ...I know you hate working in the shop, but it's our only source of income. Doctor Sophia is paying us for grandma's memory study, isn't she? Get inside, dear. Dinner's ready. You could get a job. The protests I'm organizing are what's keeping us in this house. Why does it have to be you? Somebody else in the community-- Borramey, that's enough. Where were you all day? You're supposed to watch the girls. Not chase your dumb dreams around. As long as have each other, we'll be okay. So tasty! Let's use that expense account to get a tuktuk. That money covers my personal expenses while I work for you. But what have you actually done? It's pretty obvious now that the drawing was Wat Phnom. -We could have figured that out ourselves. -Then why didn't you? I'm just saying that idea's not worth half our loot. You get your share when you earn it. I already invested a whole chicken! I learned some Bokator moves off TV so I can be the bodyguard. Hey, stop that. We don't even need a bodyguard. We will once we have all that gold. Let's check out the AUGR shop. No way they'd let us inside. Speak for yourself. What, they have a 'No Jackass' policy? Leng Heng, we're on an investigation! Come on, the main hall is this way. Here it is, just like your drawing. I brought it here. I'm sure. Then where is it? Are you looking for something in particular, children? We're on a treasure hunt. A treasure? Are you sure this statue is here? I'm not sure if it's here now, but it was a long time ago. Are either of you augmented? No, Venerable. In that case, follow me. Here it is. Let's see... This is the earliest photo of Wat Phnom. It was taken by one of the French colonists' Cambodian translators. This translator had the foresight to photograph most of the artifacts before they were taken by the French-- That's it! Many relics have been returned, but this one remains missing. Likely part of a private collection. ...they broke up the protest. I was trying to get her out before the tear gas. But in all the commotion... Mom, what happened to grandma? She just...fell out of her chair. It's not very deep, and there's no concussion. I see you brought a friend. That's Srey Leak. She's a detective! I'm just helping Leng Heng sort out his past lives. Mom, look! We found an old photo of the gold statue from my past lives. That's lucky. Come doctor, I'll walk you out. Are you staying for dinner? Yes, thank you ma'am. Thanks again for coming on such short notice. Don't worry about it. Does Leng Heng often dream of his past lives? He's always had quite the active imagination. They think the statue's in France, but I know it's still here. I just need to remember where. And you dear, do you do anything besides detective work? Yes ma'am. I sell cigarettes at the club. Borramey, can you pass the soup? Thank you very much. Are you sure the statue is still in Cambodia? It's buried somewhere. I can feel it. Thank your mom for dinner. It looks small. - That's it though. - Let me see! These statues all look the same. You don't even know where it is. Not yet, we're still investigating. This investigation is stupid. So you'll believe my dreams, but as soon as I find something real-- Come on, Leng Heng. They obviously don't care about finding a shitload of money. Hey wait! It looks like gold to me! The developers bought Thy's house and doubled the rent. Don't get mad at him. If it's out there, they just need to know where and they'll come dig. This is not the first time we have met... When I was little, you could take a boat out on Boeung Kak lake. I used to catch so many fish, you wouldn't believe! Now this was long before they filled the lake with sand and started building all those skyscrapers. Sorry, grandma! They posted an eviction notice? Our relocation community is just fifteen kilometers out of the city. Obviously we have to organize another protest. Hey, where are you two off to? I think he had another dream! He says he hid the statue in a tree, but I just want to make sure it didn't end up in some museum archive somewhere. Here it is, Google Images. It's going to take a couple of hours to run the search. Hey kid, hand me that dictionary? Hey Leng Heng! Here it is. Now you just need to find a way to pay me. Hey, what's with you today? I narrowed the search down to just over 200 images. There's no computer thing you can do to make this go faster? I thought you wanted to be a detective. This is the job. Hey! Did you have another dream? Hey, hey! You have money, kid? This is why we have that expense account. Hurry up. Turn right here. Faster! Leng Heng, what do you see? Ah no! Turn back there! Faster! Kids, I have to turn around. There's no charging station for 10 km and I'm not chancing it. What did you see? I was going to take us to the treasure! I just gave all my money to that tuktuk. We're not leaving town without knowing where we are going. Let me see. They help my grandma's memory, so I thought... Spit it out. I already swallowed it. You're not acting like yourself, Leng Heng. Those pills are messing with your mind. Put them back. I have a better idea. Srey Leak, what if someone is in there? It was locked out front, wasn't it? Ah shit. They cleared the whole place out. I can't believe they turned my house into an AUGR café. These augmented hipsters are ruining everything. Well, you know what they say. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Jackpot! What about this, Leng Heng? What if you didn't need to remember your dreams at all? My mom would kill me if she found out I came here. Srey Leak! Where'd you get these nanobugs? Did you go back to our shop?-- I didn't come to have a family moment. We want augments. You've wanted this for a while, huh sis? I guess you are old enough now. What's this? "See your dreams" The nanotransmitters capture video of whatever you look at. But you need to have one of these. Is that my sister's AUGR? We're just borrowing it. Okay...it takes the nanobugs a few hours... to replicate from the minerals in your blood. You'll probably feel...a bit weak... while your bone marrow catches up... Okay, all set? Press here. Okay buddy, your turn. Don't chicken out. Srey Leak, are you sure he's not already bugged? Sure I'm sure. He'd know, wouldn't he? There's an easy way to check. With this little guy, here. The rave's on an open network. You must've connected automatically. I can't breathe in here. Calm down, buddy. I need you to help get my little sister home, wherever that is now. Ok? I'm fine, I can take care of myself. Srey Leak, let him help you anyway. Hey kid! You need an upgrade. Your software is more than a decade old. He said I was augmented ten years ago. Nobody augments babies. You have to be thirteen. Everyone knows that. Why would anybody augment me? I'm just some kid from Tralok Bek. Kosal said it records what you see. So we're going to use it to record your dreams. A camera icon. So we're going to use it to record your dreams. There's something special about that tree. You've drawn it before. A hundred years ago, I hid this gold statue in the trunk. Who did you hide it from? From the French-- Mom, what's wrong? What's wrong with grandma? Stop! Don't touch it. It's okay, just let it cycle down. It can be dangerous to power off too quickly. Is she okay, doctor? She's fine, but her brain's building a resistance to the therapy. You followed her? Are you crazy? She's a brain doctor. Your brain is bugged. You think it's a coincidence? Vattanak. Let me help you up. Come on! Vattanak, let's go. Vattanak, let's go! Faster, Vattanak! Help me! No! You yelled in your sleep, so I took the AUGR off before you woke your mom up and she saw it. Heng! What did you say? Vattanak, let me help you up. He said my name! Who did? My big brother. I buried it here, under this tree! This was my previous life! This is it. Vattanak died and... Who is Vattanak? I told you, I heard my name. Let me see. I can't see anything. Take that thing off. You're supposed to be keeping watch. What if she's in there? If she was, the lock would be on the inside. Come on. This computer is still on. What the hell... Hey, Srey Leak! These are all my dreams. "Vattanak" The doctor knew you in your past life. I need to talk to her. No. Think about it. She figured you're Vattanak's reincarnation a while ago... and never told you. She must be trying to find the treasure too. "Dr. Vattanak Sovann" Born in Cambodia, but raised in the West, our next speaker's unique perspective has generated stunning advances in the field of cognitive neuroscience. Ladies and Gentlemen, Dr. Vattanak Sovann. Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you my Connectome. A digital replica of my consciousness mapped to the individual neuron. Through a perfect recollection of his past lives, the Buddha understood the interconnection between all living beings, and thus gained enlightenment. Since I was a child in Cambodia, I could remember glimpses of my previous incarnations. I have dedicated my life to making sense of these memory fragments to understand as the Buddha did. My karma led me to America as a young refugee. It led me to neuroscience, led me to build my Connectome. My Connectome is more than just a copy of my synapses. It is a thinking, autonomous entity, operating beyond human constraints. I hypothesize that by synchronizing my brain with my Connectome I will be able to study the underlying patterns of my past lives and synthesize a sort of universal enlightenment algorithm. We cannot know what this digital nirvana will entail, but I feel it is my destiny - my karma - to seek it. I was a scientist. This whole book is about my research into the memories of my past lives. -I did experiments on a "Connectome"-- -Stay focused. Keep translating. We just need to find out where you buried that treasure. You can always read his book once we save your family's house. Well, guess what... It says where he grew up! I know your eyes. This is not the first time we have met. Nor will it be the last. Vattanak! Hurry up! Wake up! Put your clothes on, we're late. Dr. Sophia is waiting. What does she want with me? She offered us compensation if you participate in one of her studies. Why me? I'm not so sure, myself. Welcome. Thank you. This way, please. I came to Cambodia fourteen years ago to work with Dr. Sovann on his research of human memory in this very laboratory. Vattanak was a brilliant scientist. But he was also an artist, and like Leng Heng, he painted his dreams. Vattanak and your son share the same memories. Leng Heng will have to stay here for the duration of the study. He would be under my care. I'll have to discuss this with him. Yes, of course. Thank you for your time. Thank you, doctor. You look beautiful, dear. Borramey just lent me one of her old silks. The rest of you still need to get ready, we have to leave soon. Where were you all day? We have an expedition to plan. Do's getting the guys together tonight. Aren't you excited? Yes, of course. We gather together tonight under the light of the full moon. A very auspicious day in our tradition. On Meak Bochea, we celebrate the Sangha, the community that has passed down teachings of the Enlightened One from one generation to the next. Although your homes may soon be lost, the most important thing is, we will always support each other. For our destinies are bound together. We are as one. We are really being forced out of the city. Leng Heng and I are going to dig up this treasure tomorrow. Are you in or out? See guys! I told you they found it. Prove it. We found my last life. I know his name, where he grew up, and where he buried the treasure! Here it is. It says here Vattanak survived the American bombing of his village in "Takeo, Cambodia." It's two hours south of the city. Okay, I'm in. It's a long ride down there. Time to go all in. Don't look at me. My mom's already making me pay her for that chicken. I told you we needed that expense account, didn't I? This prototype you designed is quite impressive. I've known the nano-transmitters could read neural data from the brain, but I never thought of using them to write data back. You just needed the right hardware. In any case, it's a real godsend you invited me here, Professor. I've been dying to do a human trial, to explore the full potential of my device. That's why you're here. You're really the only one doing anything truly revolutionary in the field. The next step on the path. How much of that science stuff do you understand? It all just kind of makes sense. We're gonna find a treasure! Fills me up with pleasure! We're gonna find a treasure... Hey man, stop the cart! Are you sure this is the place? Yes, I can feel it. How much will all that gold be worth, anyway? We've got to find it first, idiot. I'm gonna get a cloned tiger! Heng, look! It's the stupa from your drawings! Let me help you up. Leng Heng. Do you see something? I lost my whole family right over there. You didn't. Vattanak did. Look! It's all rusty, but this was mine. Right where I left it. Hey! Where the hell should we dig? Right here. I want to amend our deal. I want 40%, plus this knife. That knife... it's kind of the only thing we've found so far from my past lives. I guess you should keep it. No, you have it. I found what I needed. We found something! It's just old wood. Instead of deeper, we should make the hole wider to cover more ground. Hey guys, dinner is ready. Come eat! Good, I'm hungry as shit. Perfect timing. I have been searching - seeking - my whole life. And now, finally, we meet. I am ready. Synchronization is complete. Trial number 17 is winding down. Vattanak, it actually worked! You and your Connectome were completely synchronized. We are going to change the world with this technology. The Connectome wants more data. Ok, we'll get you back in as soon as the refractory period is over. No, it already has a complete copy of my neural systems. The memories of my present life are too tangled up with the memories of my past lives. The Connectome has shown me this. There's no way to study the roots without pulling up the tree and killing it. We need a fresh start. You're talking about monitoring the brain from birth. More like planting a seed, waiting patiently, and after maturation, harvesting the fruits. Our work here will be of great benefit to humanity. Of course, we will have to plant many seeds to ensure that one will grow. Did we find the treasure? Get the others up, let's get out of here. Maybe we just missed something in one of your dreams. My dreams weren't real. What do you mean? We followed them here... I don't think that Vattanak's dead. How could he not be dead if you're his reincarnation? I don't know! The treasure hunt is over. What?! Your family needed this treasure. And your friends! Did you know there wasn't a treasure before we came out here? We're all disappointed, asshole. You're the one giving up. Leng Heng. Time for bed. I had the most beautiful dream. Yes, mom. Hello. Hello. Thank you. Thank you for allowing your son to help me with my research. It was his decision. Thank you, Leng Heng. Let's go, dear. I'll see you in a couple of weeks. Are these from old phones? I haven't found a drive in weeks. I want to meet him. That's why you're here. Where'd you go, Leng Heng? It's okay. You're okay. He wants me to come back. He said that to you? No. How much for this? Is it stolen? It's locked. If you got someone to hack it, maybe I could sell it. The security on those first gen AUGRs was full of exploits. Lucky you got an old one. You want me to wipe its memory or just reset the configuration file? Don't delete anything. Okay, Leng Heng. Let's see what you missed in these dreams of yours. Looks like we're going to Takeo, huh. Leng Heng, come have some tea. Your family needed this treasure. And your friends! Very good, Leng Heng. We are getting closer. In order to take the final step, we must bring our minds into perfect alignment. Let us run the loop again. Life after life, we are reborn. Passed like a flame from one candle to the next. Driven forward by the wheel of karma. Developing, advancing, progressing toward the ultimate goal. My karma led me to build the Connectome. It is the sum of all of my past lives, not bound by human form. But, like me, it is incomplete. This is why I planted my memories in your pure mind. There, they have grown into the most exquisite tree. A perfect record of every past life I have lived. I have been preparing myself, disconnecting from the physical world. And now that you're here, we can take the final step. We will synchronize our minds with the Connectome and enter the realm of the infinite. But first, we must train our minds. Now, begin again. Begin... begin again... You said Leng Heng asked for me. He did... through these sketches. He stopped speaking a while ago. I went to his house. I thought he left town with his family. Leng Heng has slipped from reality, just like Vattanak did. I hope that having you here will keep him... grounded. Come, he's waiting. Do you really think Leng Heng will be able to wake Vattanak up? When I connected them, Vattanak's neural activity spiked for the first time in ten years. So I'm hopeful, yes. You came. Of course I came, idiot. Listen, I don't care about the treasure anymore. I just want my friend back. Leng Heng, come home. I don't care about the treasure. I just want my friend back. Come home, Leng Heng. Come home. Where are you going? You want to know who you are. I will tell you. You happened to be born in the hospital where I was conducting my research. Of all the children we injected, you are the first child in which the tree of my memories took root. And so you have been chosen by fate for the enlightenment of mankind. You and I are linked. Linked by karma. Wait! I want to meet your machine. The one with perfect memory. Careful! The Connectome requires a higher voltage. We have been waiting for you, Leng Heng. You recognize me? We recognize ourselves in you. You are the computer that put Vattanak's memories into my head. Yes. I want you to take Vattanak's memories out of my head. Yes. The data is ready to be extracted. What? Stop! I found what I needed. ...there's an order to the activity. It's as if the Connectome is indexing the boy's memory. No, I recognize this type of degeneration from my Alzheimer's patients. It's erasing his memory. It's erasing him? We must pull the tree up by the roots. Seeing our memories refracted through this pure mind... we are becoming... ...enlightened. I am the owner of my karma. Heir to my karma. Born of my karma. Whatever I do, for good or evil to that I will fall heir. I am sorry. Sit down. The memory extraction is almost complete. You have to stop this! Stop! I know your eyes. This memory has been extracted. No. Vattanak's memory of this moment has been extracted. But buried beneath it I remember standing here as another man. I told you we would meet again in another life... RELOCATION COMMUNITY Leng Heng, you're back! Mom, Leng Heng is here! Leng Heng! It's so good to have you back, dear. Srey Leak, come on!
