Boys, we're sittin' here talkin' in circles. Ain't none of us really come up with somethin'. We gotta figure it out. Well I say we go. It ain't nothin' but free heat's the way I look at it. And I don't give a good goddamn what my brother finds down there. Excuse me, John. Yeah. Paycheck's more important than gettin' shut down. Well we all need to put food on our table, ya know? My family needs me to work, ya know? We all do. Paycheck ain't gon' mean shit if you die two miles in, Kenny. Now we are filled up with more methane than any other mine in this area. If you call MSHA and they come down and go down in that fuckin' mine, they gon' shut us down methane or not. And what's he gonna do? Smitty, what are you gon' do? Tiny, what are you gon' do? There ain't no fuckin' thing - to do around here! - That mine is a bomb, Kenny! And we are all sittin' right in the middle of it! God's gonna protect us, hm? God will not protect us in Hell, John. Now you've all seen it, shift after shift. It's gettin' worse and worse, bigger and bigger. Zeke, if I die down below my family's gonna get insurance. Me up here without a job? Hell, man, I'm worthless. Well, fellas, the sump pump in the section can't keep up, all right? And when it fails we're gon' drown. You wanna add that to the list? You wanna add that to the raft of shit! I ain't blowed up or drowned in 15 years. Now I ain't scared, I ain't tellin' y'all what to be. What kinda fuckin' logic is that?

First day underground is not like your first day in kindergarten. I hope those boots are waterproof. That mine goes a hell of a lot deeper underground than the water table is. What's the water table again? It is the lowest point to where the water sits. It's geology. - On me, me. - Okay. Look, the stream is no more than 60 feet deep. Rivers, lakes, wells, no more 'n 200 feet. We are cuttin' coal 2,000 feet deep. We take on water, that's just the way it is. Okay, I'm so confused. I told him all that.

The sump pump on Nine is on life support. All right, I'll put in another work order, then. Work orders don't mean shit around here, Teresa, everybody knows that. Hell, we don't even have a mine rescue. You ain't diggin' enough coal, so they're forced to make cuts. Oh that's bullshit. We dig more goddamn coal than any mine in this area! My apologies. But the old works are leakin' more methane than I've seen in 30 years. Where's the outside foreman, huh? He's still sick. And no replacement? When those pumps give out, and they will, then my men are gonna drown two miles in, unless an ignition burns us up first. What are you gonna do? Are you gonna call MSHA? And what happens if I call MSHA, huh? What happens when MSHA shows up here? They're gonna shut us down and we're all screwed. Is that what you want? Everyone on your crew starts on time. Is that understood? That's understood. I am well aware that just by makin' this call I could be shuttin' us down, and my men are not onboard I want you to know, but if somethin' were to happen, we got no mine rescue, we got no outside foreman. It seems to me that corporate cares more about their coal reserves and their machinery than they do about their miners. All right, well, we will open up a case first thing Monday morning. Now I called MSHA to help us today, not on Monday. I understand, but Mine Safety and Health is not in the business of shuttin' down a mine without an investigation. I got men goin' into that mine tonight, do you understand? I am fully aware, but it's gonna have to wait 'til Monday mornin'. Yes, sir, thank you very much. All right. Hey, son. That's break 23, John. It's gettin' worse. Yeah, got it. Hey, red hat. Psst, hey, kid. Your dad ever told about Matt and Ben Fellows? Naw. You ain't never told him? No, he didn't tell me. Oh hell, they both worked this whole section here a piece back, good boys. But since it's your first time goin' underground, I just thought maybe you should just know somethin' about 'em. Why? Why? Matt and Ben's first eight days underground, after every single shift, they'd come out here and said they seen somethin', and it was on the, what was it, ninth, ninth day? Ninth day they said Satan appeared and he said if you ever come back down here again, boys, you gon' die. Hey hold up. Did they come back down? Hey, Daniel. - Dad. - He'll tell ya. Did they come back down? Daniel'll tell you in a minute, now. Oh hell, they didn't have a choice. They have to work, right? Yeah, but if we just say hey, you know, make it through what, 10 days? You're good to go. Yeah, it's moments like that you come face to face with God. Yeah, or Satan himself. What happened? Huh? What happened to 'em? Do I tell him? The roof fell and them boys dead. They're here one second, gone the next. Cuttin' coal is risky business, son. Gotta hold your own down here, understood? Yes, sir. And that story he told ya about them boys dyin' what got crushed? That's a lie, we're just jokin' with ya. But men do hallucinate, the methane gets to 'em.

Right, so here's the old works, North Main, South Main. Those are the three lines into this place. Yeah. Now the primary escape way is the way we just come in through the entrance track. - Yeah. - Secondary is up through the fan house along the conveyor passage. Belt, the... The belt that's right here, right here. That's where the conveyor runs. All right. Now, if all else fails, you get your ass right here. This is the North Main Chamber. Yes sir, yes sir. Hey, right here, North Main Chamber. North Main Chamber. It's where we got a refuge cache, which has got air, tools, and whatnot. Refuge catch? - Cache. - Cache.

Where's Daniel? I saw Daniel. It don't look good. Shit, no. Hey, you know you killed me, huh? You know I'm gonna die down here - because of you? - Hey! Listen, son, you listen good. - You keep your shit together. - Knock it off! - Now or never! - Who knows which direction that blast came from? I thought it came from out behind the Mains back there. Mains is that way. Kenny's right, Kenny's right. My back was facin' somewhere, out by the mouth. I think it came from behind me. I think whichever way we choose, we're still a long way from the Mains no matter what. Yes we are. - Shit. - All right. Well let's spread out and find those boys, all right. And if they didn't make it, then just put 'em together so that others can find 'em. And strip 'em of their lights and rescuers, tools, curtains, anything, anything we can find to help us get outta here, all right? Spread out and let's get workin'. All right.

That's a good sign, little brother, that's a good sign. Damn it! Goddamn it, the whole fuckin' panel's caved in. Well which way now? Well I guess we gotta find a secondary, John. Well what if we find an old route out through the travel road? Naw, naw, there's a fire down here. It's surely gon' be burnin' there, by the old works? Come on. Oh for God's sake, Kenny. Goddamn it, really? We're in a world of shit no matter what. John. What? Don't you dare. I was there when you got your 10 year chip, do you remember that? Yeah. - You remember that? - Yeah. Remember how hard fought that was? Yeah. We're gon' get outta here. And then what? There ya go. You go ahead, son. You deserve that. Fellas, there's somethin' I gotta tell you. What? I called MSHA. Aw! I told 'em we got no mine rescue, I told 'em about the methane, I told 'em about the pumps, I told 'em all of it. Well then you fuckin' killed us we don't dig ourselves outta here. Teresa woulda sent the second shift down to help dig us out. You wanna put those boys in danger, too, right? Is that you? - Is that what you want? - What do you mean? What do you mean? I tell you what it means. If MSHA knows that we aint' got no mine rescue, they ain't sendin' no men into a tickin' time bomb. That's what that means. What? By the book, Zeke. You always gotta be by the fuckin' book. We voted! Yeah, we voted. Now we are down here on our own, fellas. And if you wanna live, we gotta stick together. Is that understood, little brother?

Where did it come from? It must have started in the old works. We have no mine rescue team and the outside foreman is out sick. I want you to cease all efforts immediately, you hear me? Not one damn thing. You stand by. We will tell you what where and how. Yes, sir. Smoke. All right, come on, put on your rescuers. Curtain ain't workin'. I ain't gettin' air in mine.

We gotta try to get through the man door. Kenny. Kenny. There was a methane explosion in the Number Nine. We have four of the nine miners trapped two miles in by. They more than likely had their rescuers on for 30 minutes by now. We can not afford another Long Creek on my watch. Now we're gon' get those men out of there, Teresa. I promise you that, all right? Now do you have any dynamite here? In the shed, we got six sticks. All right, good. Now you keep it right there for now. Now how far is that communication line gonna get me? Two miles. All right, we'll go on in there when it's safe, all right? They only have 30 minutes of air left. If we are wrong, we're not gonna lose just nine men, we're gonna lose 12.

Name's Travice Hurley. I've got about roughly 7 1/2 years underground. David Beverly, goin' on 20 years. Cock, and I've worked the coal mines for 42 years. My name's Dan Justice and I been coal minin' for about 45 years. Patrick Boggs, I been a miner for 13 years. My name's Nathaniel Stacy. I been workin' underground for about 10 months now. My dad was a coal miner. I followed in his footsteps. Just a family tradition. It's in my blood, that's all my dad done. Like I said, I was raised into it. It's the lifestyle I was raised in and I just kinda picked it up myself. Real coal miners that'll go do it, take care of the job, do whatever they need to do, and be right there beside you no matter what, there's not many of us left. That's right. Coal mining is a way of life. It's in my blood, I love it. It's a dangerous job, it's a dirty job, but it pays the bills. He works seven days a week, and I work six, and sometimes seven, and we're here anywhere from 13 to 15 hours a day. So, not much family life. You gotta hunt for it to get an hour or two with the family. Yup. Absolutely gotta hunt for the time. It's hard on ya, it's hard on your body. It takes a beaten. Time consuming. You spend more time here than ya do with your families, mainly. Ya know, you spend 10, 12 hours a day here. You might spend a couple hours with your family and then ya gotta go to bed, get up for the next day. Those are your best friends under there, ya know. You work together, you talk together. You spend more time with them than you do your family. Ya know, so, you can kinda figure what kinda bond ya have and what they actually mean to ya. It don't matter what it is. They'll be there. All you gotta do is ask. That's right. You holler, somebody's comin'. He won't be runnin' away from ya, he'll be runnin' to ya. When I go underground, I know I've got help if I need help. They're there. They don't get mad, they come help me. I do the same for them. This is my family. It's a lot harder than what people think. Ya know, I mean, you get up, I know most jobs you work five and six days a week, but here you're back in a hole probably two, three miles and you don't know if you're gonna see daylight every day. You just change the date. Ya know, a lot of people goes in, works in a buildin', no worries, no nothin', and underground you never know. Ya know, anything can happen. Back where I lived at, UBB blew up. That wasn't four miles from my house. 29 men got killed. I knew probably 90% of 'em. Ya know, I mean, it's just dangerous. Ya know, everybody gotta watch everybody. When you start out, you love it or you hate it. That's really all I know. He quoted the Bible from time to time and he said you get to know the Lord workin' deep in the mine He raised two good daughters and one fine son. Any man would be proud of the job he had done. We had a couple more drinks and I took him home. And after meeting his wife, I wrote this song. She talked of the danger deep in the mines, the grief and the worry all the time. And the way she talked, I knew he had black lung. A high price to pay for a job well done. ♪ Coal miner, coal miner shinin' your light ♪ ♪ Workin' in the mineshaft dark as the night ♪ ♪ Whatcha gonna do before ya go back in ♪ ♪ I'm gonna ask the Lord to let me come out again ♪ I never realized 'til I came to this town just how many men are workin' under the ground.
