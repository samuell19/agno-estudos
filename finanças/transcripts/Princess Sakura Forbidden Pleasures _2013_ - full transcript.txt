What is it, Princess Sakura? This must be my brother. Or maybe it's my sister. That girl, sir, is Princess Sakura. She's daughter to Samon Yoshida, the nobleman. She's cherry blossom incarnate. Any man alive would want to Be intimate with her. Princess Sakura... Princess Sakura: Forbidden Pleasures Somebody, help! It's no use screaming, nobody will come. Your body's saying, "Don't let anyone come in." Please, stop! That's not the plan. I broke in for something else but I wanted to see If you're cherry blossom incarnate. We had a proposal from the Nakano Family. Their heir is apparently fond of you So he wants you for his wife. You don't look happy. I am, Father. Is there another man on your mind? No. This is our family treasure. This seagull scroll was granted to us by the shogun. The Yoshida family's pride and honor must be upheld. Understood? Yes. Oh, I'm sorry... Is something bothering you? Your playing is different today. And you have a curious scent... Shall we take a break? Master Yoshida! The Princess is also missing! Where has she gone...? Summer of same year Kozukahara Execution Ground Just outside the Shogun's Capital Come one, come all! You saw the severed heads of the condemned! How about our head? The flowers at Hell House brothel will blossom to your ding-dong! Heaven on Earth at the Hell House! Hell... Only outsiders dress like that... I'm from the real Hell. Very funny. Move on please. A rumor of an unrivaled whore brought me here. Wind Chime Princess. She's as sweet as a chime in a breeze But tolls like a bell when aroused. Is that true? Yes, but you'll have to be patient. It takes about 3 days to see her. Our guest is leaving! I'll be back. Come again, we'll treat you like a king! You needn't wait 3 days for these girls! That's Onatsu, Osen, Osan, Oman, And Oshichi. Meet the angels in Hell. That one... Intrigues me. Unbelievable! Wind Chime. What a lovely sound! I promise you that I'll come back for you. You're so sweet. Can I ask a favor of you? Name it. I'd do anything for you. I'm looking for a tattoo. A tattoo? Yes. There's a man with a tattoo Of a bell just like this. What do you want him for? You love him? No, it is vengeance I seek. He took everything from me. I detest him. Oh, I'm beat! My back aches! My poor body slaves away day and night. When did you last have a customer? You had no one yesterday! Stop your crazies and start mopping! Why don't they hire someone to clean? Even our marquee attraction is cleaning! It's OK. I don't mind. I like doing physical work. Did you hear that? She's so nice! You've been here 2 months now And you're still acting. She's not a born whore like you! Now I'm pissed! Be quiet! Oshichi. I'm trying to sleep here. I won't take that from a lazyass who sleeps all day! I'm so sorry, Oshichi. But I'm tired of hearing about Wind Chime! You brownnosing side-stick! You mean, sidekick. What's that? You think you're a queen! Then try to get more customers! You're asking for it! Stop it! Keep your hands off of me! You don't deserve to be the marquee attraction! Let's go. It's ding-dong time! It hurts! Oh, but I don't know... Maybe I like it like this...! I can't hold it anymore! Don't moan! Play dead. No wait is too long for the Wind Chime Princess. Next please. Hey! Wind Chime Princess, where are you? You're Shiragiku-maru reincarnated! I'm down and out but I'm still a man! I can bring you back from your jump from the cliff! Be quiet! You're here, Wind Chime Princess! You've gone too far, monk! How dare you step over Hell House's threshold with no money! If I see you again, I'll feed you to a turtle! Yuck, I touched that filthy thing! You know him? That monk attempted suicide with his lover. A monk did such a thing? Who was the girl? It was a boy. A boy servant called Shiragiku-maru. Of course! That's who he was talking about. The boy served at a shrine And got tricked into hustling. And he ended up jumping off the cliff with the monk. But only the boy died while the monk survived. Now he thinks Wind Chime is the boy reincarnated. You impress me with your knowledge. Wind Chime Princess. Maybe the boy servant... Was as good in bed as the Princess. How intriguing! I want to know more about it. Get out if you choose Wind Chime over me. I won't go after her. I intend to live a long time. Okay... When will I see him again? Will I ever see him again? When will I see him again? When will I see him? How miserable am I... My only hope is to make love to Wind Chime Princess. Then she'll remember... That she's Shiragiku-maru reincarnated. I want to see her. I want to do it with her... Hey, monk. Is Wind Chime Princess that incredible? Yes. She's not of this Earth. Is she a ghost? No, she is an angel. Who is out there? Who is it? It's you again! Ouch, it's hot! We have a customer! Coming in. This way. What's the idea? I want Wind Chime. Uh... what was that? I want to screw Wind Chime. Oh, but sir...! I know everybody waits 3 days to screw her. But she's with a client now... I'll see what I can do. No problem is unsurmountable! Right, Oshichi? Say something! He's your customer. Stay out! This is Wind Chime Princess. It's you! You forgot me? Why are you here? It's beautiful! That's quick! Those moans... It's her! Those enchanting moans are irresistible! They're not of this Earth... So mesmerizing. But is she with that man? No! Is that man jamming himself into her Wind Chime now? You became a whore at this brothel just to find me? That's crazy. I might never have showed up. I knew you would. I prayed to the fox spirit every day. I knew we'd meet again. But this thing doesn't look good on you. Why this? I imitated you. I wanted a tattoo of a bell like yours. But my arm's skinny so it looks like a wind chime. Oh, you...! I'm so happy! Don't sit like that! The Hell House Special. These pills will rejuvenate you. Pee-chan! Hi, Pee! As squishy as ever! What are these new pills? Watch out. Miwa had one of those pills and lost her hair. His pills give me energy. You can have mine then. Was Mr. Takuetsu really a physician? He says he served a renowned Lord. I doubt it. What was that, Osan? Nothing. I won't let you touch my Wind Chime Princess! Relax, she's a brothel whore. Nobody owns her, not you, not me. She sure is an angel, as you put it. So you screwed her! I sure did. Bastard! Try harder. Bastard! If I was tougher... I would have torn him into pieces. Bastard... What you just said now... Do you mean it? I heard what you just said, monk. You said you'd tear him apart if you were tougher. - Would you? - Yes. I swear I would. This is something. I'll test it on Wind Chime. No, I wouldn't want her to die. Maybe Oman... How about Onatsu? A strange man is back there. What? It's the monk. That crazy son of a bitch! A blend of salamander, eel and softshell turtle. It'll give you strength. I hope so. Now beat the shit out of that man like you promised. Willingly. May I ask why you're doing this? Because he thinks Wind Chime is better than me. He'll learn the hard way What happens if he doesn't treat me right. In other words, you're a jealous woman. Shut up and take the pills! Okay, I will! Well? Do you feel empowered? I feel hot. I'm hot! I'm super hot! Monk! Where are you going? Hey, monk? He's dead! Rest in peace. Oh, it's you. Here you are, you thief! Where have you been hiding for 3 months? It wasn't me who was hiding. It's you who didn't contact me. After you rushed me on that job. Where is it? Sorry, but the price went up! What did you just say? You'll have to pay more if you want it. You! You tricked me! Behave! Don't... One wrong move and this goes up in smoke. Damn it! You slimeball... How much are you asking for it? Let's see... How about 500? 500 gold coins! Don't look so shocked. It's not your money you're spending. It's that big shot boss of yours. I'll see you when you've got my fee. You asshole! It's your own fault! I know you stole my important pills! What are you talking about? Don't play innocent! Somebody saw you take my pills! I didn't steal it! Shut up! I have evidence! You were once our marquee attraction. But now you'll pay for violating the rules. - Surrender. - I give up! Sorry, Oshichi. That's our rule. Prick! Prick! Here we are. This is your destination, sir. Welcome to Hell! How many girls? 7 supreme girls. Send them all to our suite. All 7 of them! I have money. I'm having myself a Hell tour! This is the worst. Oshichi, are you OK? Oh... You're so kind. We're all in this Hell together. Can you untie me? I want to show you something. I was mean to you so I want to make it up to you. Are you OK? Where are you going? Come back! You moron! Don't mistake me for an ally. I'll show you what it's really like... In Hell. All aboard, for the Hell tour! Here we go! You bitch! I know you snitched on me! Don't go away. Die, die, you bitch! You're the kind of woman I really, really hate! I can't die and leave him behind! What have I done...? Oh, my God! You bitch. Just wait. I'll kill you soon. I'll kill you. Princess Sakura's sickness might be a ruse. You mean, Mr. Yoshida's daughter? Yes, the one who's as beautiful as cherry blossom. But she hasn't been seen for 3 months. That long! A person wouldn't be sick that long. Yes, it sounds suspicious. I did a little detective work and asked around. It's difficult to pinpoint what's going on but Apparently their seagull scroll was stolen. A seagull scroll...? Move. I'll tell you what it is. The scroll was given to the Yoshida Family by the Shogun. If it really was stolen The Yoshida Family will be renounced. It's a hand! A hand! Oh, boy. Rain means bad weather. Nobody comes in the rain. Why don't I torture Oshichi for fun? What was that scream? What happened to you? There's a monster here. It's the monk! What's going on? What's he want? Go away! Wind Chime. I mean, Shiragiku-maru. I missed you. Oh, no... How ironic... My boy is right before me now. But I can't touch him. I can't touch him! I'm not Shiragiku-maru. I'm not the person you think I am. But... I know very well how you feel. Wind Chime... You've become hideous In order to consummate your love. I know how you feel. Wind Chime. Wind Chime. Wind Chime! Looks like stupid Oshichi has run away. That would be right. She'll be found and punished severely. What a night! It's been like a nightmare. Wind Chime... I sometimes have this strange dream. A dream? In the dream, I live in a faraway land. I'm in a room like I've never seen. It's full of strange tools. There are many tall houses outside. There are iron horses and carriages running around. It's actually a fun place. You can get whatever you want. It's a nice dream. But I'm all by myself in that dream. All alone? Nobody can understand me. Nobody even notices me. It's a recurring dream. Sometimes I have scary thoughts. Maybe Hell House is just a dream And I'm alone in the real world. It's not nice to be alone. How does it feel to be 3 feet taller? You're noisy. Don't interrupt my contemplation. Or I'll kill you. I warned you! Is everything in place? No. There's one more. I broke in for something else but I wanted to see If you're cherry blossom incarnate. What's on your mind? That night Why did you make love to me? You're asking now? I don't know... I was tempted by the cherry blossom. You broke in for something else. That's what you said. Go ahead. I stole your family scroll. - Where is it? - I don't know. You didn't come for me! It's been a while. I can't remember. Hurry! You're late! You think you're Musashi! Who is he? The money! It isn't easy to get 500 gold coins. - Goodbye. - Wait! I'm not finished. I have 200 in advance. I'll get you the rest soon. OK. Show me the scroll. I want to see if it's safe. That's lame. The water creatures are operating alone! I want to seal the deal with no violence. No violence. I like that. Now give me 500 more. You've raised it again! No violence sucks. Let's go. You bastard! The scroll! Give me the scroll! I don't have it on me. Damn you! Sir. I know where the man with the bell tattoo has gone. You do? To Hell House brothel by the execution ground. Screw me. I have money. Oh, it works! I can meet Wind Chime. I can screw her now! Whoops! I'd better not get too excited. May Buddha be with you. I'll take a fee for my prayer. Is this establishment, Hell House? Uh, maybe. Is there a girl here named Wind Chime? I suppose so. I'm here to see that girl. But, Sister, this is a brothel. I've never heard of a nun buying a whore. Maybe I can help you with your urges And we'll go to Heaven together. Infidel! Watch out, she's a strange one! Princess Sakura. Koto Master! The seagull scroll is missing. And you didn't steal it. No, I swear it wasn't me. Master. How did you learn that I was here? People said, Wind Chime Princess is cherry blossom incarnate. I thought it might be you. I didn't want to believe it was true... Your father has been bedridden since you disappeared. He tried every method available to find you. He even asked a blind woman to find you. I'm best qualified to trace your scent. Like a dog. Princess. I want you to tell me what's going on. I suspect that you're feeling lost... Does it concern a man? Am I right? I think I'm losing my mind. I can't... I can't go on without Gonsuke. But now the family is at risk. I know that I fled my home But I can't let Father die like this. What am I supposed to do? How do I choose? I can't! Who's there! So that's your story. Is this the...? It's yours. Sir, you're a good patron but you can't do as you please! 100 coins. That should be enough to free Wind Chime. - Any problem? - No! Thank you! As you wish! Hurry up and count them! Even cats are faster! Thank you, sir! And Sister... I'd appreciate it if you could take that scroll And the Princess back to the castle. Here. For your trouble. Wait! That's not what I want! Have a happy life. That's that! Now be gone! Those bastards! Take care, Princess! There he is, get him! Princess, there are many customers waiting. The scroll's here! She has it! Hand me the scroll. Osen... why? Oshichi is history and so are you. So I'm the marquee girl now. Wait a sec... I don't know why but... She annoys me. Now hand me the scroll. Don't be scared. Come to me. There, there. Relax. Come on, baby! Hold it. Hold it, hold it. Let Monk Seigen handle this. You demon from hell! What have I done? Gold! What is this? What's going on? Calm down, my boy! This is strange. I feel weird. Focus, men! Come on, fools! Make love to me, please. Oh, what a fool... I'm a fool... The scroll! The seagull scroll! Out of the way! Playtime is over. Gonsuke... Out-of-season cherry blossom. Kill him! Out of my way! Give it to me. Woman...! Move. Move! You've worked up a sweat! Come on! To your right, no left! Whoops, you missed! Let go! You're dead! Princess! Wait a minute. Oshichi! I'm the number one whore! I'll remind you just in case you forgot! No! Let go, you creature! I'm not Wind Chime Princess! She's over there! Can't you see? Tell me something. Are you dying? Yeah, I guess so. OK, good. Give me the scroll first Then die. You think it's that simple, you moron. Give me a break! You're so mean! What would a dead man do with a scroll? Stop crying! A samurai does not weep. If I don't return with the scroll I'll be beheaded. That's too bad. But all I can think about is me and the girl. What a girl she is...! She's supreme inside and outside. Oh, the way she moans... That's nothing to do with me! It means everything! Don't you agree, mister? Yes. And I'm having a good time now. Is merciful Buddha here to take you too? No, I still have things to do. I know! So she is my Shiragiku-maru reincarnated! She is the one! Whatever it's about, I'm happy for you. OK, it's time for me to go. Don't die yet! First tell me where I can find the girl and the scroll! Ouch! Oh, gross! "Justice" You deserve it. I smell something nice. I'll see you in Hell. Have a nice trip. How hilarious. Gonsuke... Gonsuke! Is this a dream? Au revoir, Princess. The river streams into the sea And the sea leads to the realm of eternity That has no end... Gonsuke! Gonsuke! The following spring It's still there. Sir, it could be worse. Be thankful you kept your head. Oh, you're the boatman. Don't call me that. I have a name, Nanboku Tsuruya, the playwright. "Princess Sakura" "Mr. Yoshida's daughter" "Princess Sakura will marry a notable samurai." "Her beauty like cherry blossom will only improve." She's supreme inside and outside. And the way she moans... Oh, gross! Let me eat! Yes? You want some? How's that, Honey? Delicious!
