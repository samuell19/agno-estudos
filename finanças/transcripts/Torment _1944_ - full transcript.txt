TORMENT Directed by ALF SJÖBERG PRIMARY / SECONDARY SCHOOL You there! Stop! What offence has this miserable young man committed? He was late for morning prayers. So was I. I don't know my Latin. I bet I get caught. I had a feeling earlier. - Where was it? - In my stomach. The runs I have! Isn't my soprano voice pretty? Shut up. I'm cramming! Stop bothering me! Volo, nolo, malo, cupio, juvio... Look at Caligula, our resident sadist. Devising his next hellish torture. - Should be fun. - I'm sure it will be exquisite. I was really down when my gal told me she was knocked up. - Jeez! - I wasn't planning to be a family man. - Not yet, at least. - Of course not. - No hymn book? - Stolen. Don't lie. Stand to the side. - Think I'll get a demerit? - Figures I'd get caught. I'll show no mercy. Refuse to take me seriously and I'll do the same to you. If you wish to make this unpleasant, that's just fine with me. Please continue, Mr. Petterson. "After Fabius Maximus had thus decamped, the army marched on for ten days, whereupon it pitched camp by the Igas River. The seconds-in-command were called to the consul's tent, where he told them -- Where he told them that... whereas it would not be impossible, the strategy would -- That they, however --" I couldn't make out this sentence, sir. I see. Then may I trouble you to take the next one? "To the legates, this seemed... and later, privately, amongst themselves... yet in spite of this --" You didn't have time to open your books, Mr. Petterson. At least not to the right page. But I'll be lenient and give you a chance to reflect. Please continue, Mr. Widgren. "To the legates, this seemed a good statement." Is that what it says? Karling? - "Proposal." - Continue. "A good proposal. Whereupon they agreed a large gift would be given to..." Don't you know your own language? We don't say "give a gift." That's bad Swedish. What do we say, Mr. Widgren? Aren't we quick-witted today? Ström? "Present a gift." Are you familiar with the phrase, Mr. Widgren? Yes, of course. Of course. Continue. "They stepped before the consul and assured him they were ready." Thank you. That will be all. "Afford a person pleasure." Widgren! Afficere aliquem laetitia. "Instil fear in someone." In... aliquem timore. "Instil." Well? Inicere. Someone whispered that. Examples of the genitive with impersonal verbs. Kreutz? Miseret, paenitet, piget, pudet, taedet. "Pardon." Karlsson? Parco, peperci, parsum, parcere. "Beat." Bokstedt? Plango... plantice. Wrong! Bergström? Plango, planxi, planctum, plangere. Caesar hostem aggressus devicit. - Widgren? - "Caesar defeated the enemy." Example of what? Participial construction. - Which one? - Participium coniunctum. - Predicative attribute. - Of what? Didn't you prepare the lesson? I did, sir. I believe you're lying, Mr. Widgren. I'm not, sir. No? No. I see. Which verbs take the genitive? Those that mean remind, remember forget, accuse, convince, judge, acquit. All transactional verbs. - Example? - Aestimo. - Oh? - Facio, duco, puto. - Really? - Camor. Mercior. Dono. You still claim you know the lesson? I knew it yesterday. You're lazy, and you pay no attention to me or my lessons. - That's not true. - Isn't it? Open your book! Begin with today's exercise! Quickly! "The battle raged for three days. Eventually the Romans routed Hannibal's forces. A great number were taken prisoner and brought before the consul." What is this? Using forbidden aids, Mr. Widgren? I forgot to erase it. "I forgot to erase it." Of course. You forgot to erase it. This is cheating, sir! Cheating! It's unfortunate, having to punish a pupil just two months before finals. Two weeks before trial exams. Most unfortunate. Most unfortunate. I'll speak to the headmaster. I believe we'll be seeing quite a bit of one another, Mr. Jan-Erik Widgren. Good afternoon. - He should be shot! - Bastard! Sadist! I can't wait to be rid of this misery. Boy, am I going to sleep then! Sleep and eat and forget all about this place. Let's get some cigs. Hello, my dear Carmen. Hello. What will it be -- a cola? You know I can't sell tobacco to schoolboys. - Bye now. - Bye-bye, sweetheart. - It's for my dad. - Get off it! Stop it! Let's go, Sandman. I'll take this magazine, miss. Thank you. Good day. A pack of Havanas and a Hudson. Could you open it for me, please? I'm so clumsy. Did you cut yourself? It's nothing. Nothing at all. - Anything else, sir? - No, thanks. Charge my account as usual. Good day. You look out of sorts, Jan-Erik. Bror, dear, you mustn't lean back in your chair. Jan still looks out of sorts. Mind your own business. He's just trying to show concern. Kids should keep their mouth shut when they eat. - How did you do in school today? - All right, I guess. Is that the truth? No. Was it something unpleasant? You answer it, Bror. - Tell me what happened. - I got a demerit. For cheating. - How did you know? - Your Latin teacher called. - The demerit seems justified. - Jan-Erik. - How could you cause us such pain? - I didn't cheat. It was illegible. I wrote it while preparing and forgot to erase it. It's most unfortunate, especially now, just before graduation. - It's not that bad. - That's a matter of opinion. You seem to take it lightly. Your mother and I are very upset. In my opinion, you've tarnished your reputation. Shall we leave the table? - It's not as if I'm a criminal, is it? - Don't mind Dad. You know what he's like. Sandman's on the phone. He wants to go to the movies. Hey, you! I'm beat. Wouldn't it be great to have a bed like the one in the movie? And a nice dame too. - You think? - You bet. A table filled with grub and booze, that bed and a dame. I wouldn't get up for two weeks. I'd just eat and sleep and make it with the broad. You're a true materialist. I see things differently. I'm going to write and play the violin all the time, once I'm out of that hellish place. As for women and the rest... I'll only have one. - And I'll love her. - Well, well. You don't have one now, do you? What about Lena? - I'm not in love with her. - In love? You're nuts. I suppose you want a girl who's pure and innocent. - Yes. - They don't exist. Really? All women are tramps. And if they're not, they want to be. Nietzsche and Strindberg both say so. Miss, the bill, please. Coming up? No, I've got to study that blasted Latin. That Caligula is a bastard. Oh, I don't know. He's more odd than anything. When you turn over a stone, you find nasty creatures underneath. Caligula isn't a genuine swine. He's a nasty little venomous creep. I don't believe a person can be all evil. You're still an adolescent. Just wait. You'll see how rotten everything is. It's truly ingenious. Good night. - You must think I'm a real fool. - Nonsense. You're the only one I can talk to. You can't help it if you're an idealist who believes in innocent women. - Good night. - See you. Are you all right? Never felt better in my life. - Miss Olsson! Can I help you? - Oh, shut up! What are you staring at? Bothering a lady like this. Don't be silly. You need help. Silly, eh? Come closer and I'll give you -- - Stop babbling. Where do you live? - Let me go! Stop shouting! Where do you live? None of your business! Try to act sober. There's a policeman up there. Now where do you live? ...number 32, fourth floor. Leave my brandy alone! Leave me alone. I'm going. Good-bye. No, don't go! I'm scared to be alone. He might come. I'm so terribly afraid of him. - Please don't go! Please! - Who are you afraid of? I can't tell you. He knows everything. He spies on me. And when he's here -- Please stay. I can't stand it any longer! I can't stand it! I know it: He'll be the death of me. The way he torments me! Stay with me, please. I can't. You can't? Why not? - My parents will be mad. - Mad? I suppose you have homework. Yes, I do. Go on then! Still here? What's it going to be? I'd like to stay... But? I don't love you. - Does it matter? - It does to me. - Do I disgust you? - No. Are you scared of me? Yes, a little. Don't be. No. No, don't. - Are you leaving? - I have to. It's half past 3:00. Come and say good-bye. It was kind of you to stay. Sure, very kind. Come back and see me often. We'll see. Promise. You must promise. All right, I promise. Promise Pelle too. Yes, Pelle, I'll be back. You promised. Good night. - Has anyone seen Petterson? - He's still in the classroom, sir. There you are, Petterson. I need to talk to you. - I know. - Come here. Petterson, Petterson. It's not easy to be form master when something like this happens. Why were you truant, Petterson? What possessed you? Were you afraid of someone? Hadn't you prepared the lesson? We really must discuss this. Can't you see that? Yes. Well? You see, it was Caligula -- I mean, the Latin teacher. Yes, I understand. - He scares you. - Scares you? Your mind goes blank. You're struck dumb. All the others hate him too. We're all scared. Most teachers you respect, but he enjoys frightening us. He's a sadist. You believe that, Petterson? I don't know. So you were truant on Monday because it was a double Latin class. Every Sunday is ruined because of the double Latin class on Monday. And now you get a demerit, Petterson. Was it worth it? Yes. Are you that frightened? Please don't give me a demerit. It will spoil my oral exam. Please! I won't do it again. My parents will be so angry. I don't dare go home. I'm too indulgent. Good thing I'm retiring next year. I can't be loyal to both pupils and teachers. You watch it, Petterson! Don't do this again! I think the boys are afraid of you. It won't do them any harm. You can't teach the pupils anything that way. No? I mean... why not try to be a bit nicer? They're not bad kids. Lazy, yes. But they're good boys, really. At least I think so. You know, our work is complicated. Wouldn't it be best to meet them halfway? We shouldn't be the boys' enemies. The job is nerve-racking enough as it is. - Are you saying I terrorize them? - I didn't say that. - Then what are you getting at? - That a man of your learning shouldn't care so much for respect bred from fear. - That's no concern of yours. - It is! It's my class, and my boys. - So it hurts them, does it? - Yes. Not all, but some. The others just despise you and laugh at you behind your back. How do you know that? I know my boys. - And I don't? - No, you don't. If you did, you'd behave differently. Behave? Kindly refrain from using that word. This isn't a matter of words. I thought you cared about your boys. But I'm just an old fool. Oh? I see now that you don't care one iota about them. Really? Well, do you care about them? A teacher must care about his boys. Or else what does he care about in life? I don't wish to be cross-examined! Who took map No. 40? I wish to make it clear to you that you are unsuited to be a teacher! Maybe I am too, because I'm too kind. But I like my boys -- and I'm not afraid of them! Are you saying I'm afraid? Nonsense! For you it's a fight to the death. "Frighten me, and I'll scare you to death!" I'm telling you that's wrong, since you can't see it for yourself. - Where is map No. 40? - Stand still and calm down. Just listen to me. I'm old enough to be your father. Our profession is a vocation. That means it's a calling, something that comes naturally. Your academic qualifications and years of service alone don't make you a teacher. You don't know the first thing about boys! There's something called heart and joy. A bit of kindness and understanding. But you don't have enough of those to feed a flea! If you were a special case, it wouldn't be so bad. But you can be found in every school! And not just schools, but everywhere else! A tormentor of human beings, that's what you are! Listen to me. I've been ill. Very ill. My nerves have still not quite recovered. The curriculum is tough and demanding. I'm impartial. I don't coddle or indulge. I work objectively. And I won't change just because some nervous imbecile complained! Where is that map? Oh, sorry. I have it. Good day. Is Widgren here? No. - Where is he? - He went to get some notebooks. Ah, there you are. - Did you want something, sir? - I want to speak to you. Let's sit down over there. Widgren, it's a shame there's bad feelings between us. A great shame. I don't want you to dislike me. You see... I've had a difficult time. And I've been ill. Very ill. I've been watching you, Widgren. You view me with aversion, almost animosity. Please don't. I don't know what to say. I've got nothing against you, sir. Yes, you do. You must stop looking at me that way. I forbid you! That will be all, Widgren. What did our resident sadist want? He's the devil himself! Who's the girl you were seen with in the street last week? - Oh, just a friend. - I see. A girlfriend. You play beautifully. You're so talented. That was nothing. I have no time to practice these days. An adolescent's dream: to sit in his girlfriend's room, eating biscuits. - You're in a good mood. - I'm so happy right now. I don't care what happens. The twilight's beautiful. Why don't we go for a walk on the main promenade? We can laugh at Caligula and all the other teachers! I don't know. Tell me. Do you like me just a little? You see, I -- You see that star? It seems to hang far below the sky on an invisible string. It's been great company to me. If you only knew how lonely I've been. Lonely? Who hasn't been lonely? I used to stand at the crossing, watching the trains. Don't laugh. I'd imagine myself on one of those trains one day. A sweet young woman in a bell-shaped skirt and a funny hat, with no luggage. Now you'd be there too. Would you want to come? Nothing would ever frighten us again. You were so afraid before. Was someone frightening you? Yes. Won't you tell me who he was? No, I can't. I don't dare! He's tried to get in. I heard him fumbling with his key in the new lock. He's called too. Sometimes I've felt him following me in the street. Let's not talk about that now. Let's have some tea. My friend Sandman is a cynic and a misogynist. He's terribly smart. He thinks I'm juvenile. Do you think so too? Not at all. I've never felt as good as I do with you. Bertha, were there many before me? No, but you see, it was fun having them chase me. - Have you never really been in love? - No. - Why not? - Don't be stupid! No one ever wanted me. I wanted to live a little. And I thought that -- Oh, never mind. I was wrong, anyway. I don't believe you. You're lying! You're just trying to scare me! He's a beast! A beast! Bertha! Who is it? You mustn't leave me. You hear me, my darling? Don't just sit there. Hold me. Don't let him come here. I'm so afraid. What are you afraid of? Does he hurt you? It's not just that. Don't turn the light on. Jan-Erik! Stay with me, will you? Don't be afraid. There's no such thing as ghosts. I've seen at least one. That's dead and buried as of tonight. I'd like to believe that. Listen. I have something for you. It's a key to my door. You can come and go as you please. - Thanks, but what about my exams? - I'm sure you'll do well. - I haven't studied at all. - I'll keep my fingers crossed. I wonder what topics will come up. Damn! No! FIRST DAY OF EXAMS Now we'll pay for our years of neglect. We should be dressed up. - You're an old hand. - Second time around. I'm no amateur. There should be a drum roll. And we could all sing "Fear not, little flock." Shh! The headmaster. - Hot, isn't it? - Yes, very hot. Look at them in their funeral attire. You know why they all dress up like undertakers? They've got the jitters, you see. Today is their big day. They get puffed up with importance by the exams. Year after year, they never get any further than the diploma. It doesn't get any bigger. This is their climax. It's a grand occasion -- for them. Gentlemen, please take the seat corresponding to your number. Would Bergman and Ström please approach. Please verify that the seal is unbroken. Thank you. Please be seated. Would the senior master kindly distribute the papers on my command. Please begin. What's the matter? You're drunk! What happened? Answer me! Who was here? For God's sake, answer me! Bertha, tell me. You must tell me what's happened. You can't just stand there like that, not saying a word. You hear me? You know I'm very fond of you, don't you? You've been so kind to me. We've been so good together. Is that all over now? No fun being decent, was it? Answer me. Is it all over? Is it? Yes, it's all over. He'll kill me. He sits there playing with his penknife, speaking slowly and quietly. He tells me such horrible things. Filthy, horrible things! Suddenly he gets nervous and starts pacing the room. He has such horrid white hands, with hairy fingers. Stop talking about the creep! I don't want to know who he is. A moment ago you wanted to. How did I get into this? I want to be left alone! Christ, I'm so fed up with this! With me too? I don't know. The way you act, it's like I never knew you. And you just said we're through. Just as well. I wouldn't want to share you. One week until finals. I wish it were all over. Just a week? It's crazy! I've heard the examiners are a mean bunch. I can't think in this heat. Your head swells up so big, you can't get your cap on. All sense evaporates. It's all crap! Miserable, pointless, ridiculous crap! - The devil's coming! - He looks strange. - He always looks strange. - Whisper the answers. - All present? - Yes, sir. Close the windows. Widgren will begin today's translation. I'm not prepared. - Have you gone mad? - I had no time. No time? I was too tired. I was studying history half the night. I see. So you were too tired? I see. Mr. Widgren was too tired. - A peculiar explanation. - I study all I can. - You make no effort in my class. - That's not true! Is that so? Was anyone else too tired to prepare today's lesson? No? Then perhaps we're not too tired to put on our jackets. Mr. Widgren seems particularly delicate. Why is that? I don't know. I do my best. You're lazy, Mr. Widgren, and just a bit pathetic. This is no place for weak boys. We're heading into exams. Don't you understand, Widgren? No. But one day you will, but it'll be too late then. You know what I think? I think you'll receive a poor grade in Latin. Very poor. You know what else? You're too frail for the exam. It's a baptism by fire. It's really not for you. Not at all. Please begin, Petterson. Can you imagine? A rascal in the third form put this on the floor in front of me during class. It hopped straight up to me, chirping all the while. What's so funny about that? What's this noise? Someone's making a racket. It was me, sir. Sorry. You see, I know you all call me "Birdie." It's a nice name. I know teachers who are known by much worse. Sandman, close that Greek textbook. Don't study for your next subject during my class. And don't think I'm too senile to spot you. Shame on you! A man of doubtful reputation. This set of essays contains two absolute howlers. Mr. Petterson will have to acknowledge paternity for one. He writes as follows: "The nomadic Laplanders never stay in one place for very long." Mr. Sandman has a darker side. He consorts with gangsters and loose women, in a mixture of Maupassant and Zola. He writes -- What's the matter, Mr. Widgren? May I go home, sir? Of course! How do you feel? Dear me, are you very ill? No, I just feel a bit sick. What on earth? I can't understand how he can be overworked. He hasn't worked all that much lately. School. There are other things besides school, aren't there, Mr. Widgren? What do you mean, Doctor? Oh, nothing in particular. As a doctor, you get to see the unpleasant side of school life. Thin and deformed individuals. A taxi, please. Lopsided, warped, scrawny, undernourished and overworked. Could you send a taxi to -- What's the address? No. 11 Brahegatan. For Dr. Nilsson. Sunken chests, bloodshot eyes, anemia, even twisted sex lives -- What's that? Yes, Dr. Nilsson. It's not that strange, really. There they sit on their bottoms from 8:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. And after that they have homework. Does that make any sense? Thank you so much. The curriculum gets more and more demanding. The teachers become narrow-minded specialists. Were the boys to learn all that's asked of them, they'd be in an asylum. But they're not that stupid, our young ones. They do their best, with the aid of a bit of trickery. The fact they're still in such good trim I attribute to well-developed lazybones. So you mean that cheating and truancy are justified? Certainly not. But it's a crying shame that boys should be driven to it to avoid exhaustion. - They should learn to behave. - I agree. But I doubt today's methods will lead to that. Take good care of the boy. Let him stay in bed for a day or two. He looks like he's carrying the world's problems on his shoulders. Terribly hot, isn't it? Good-bye. - Torsten. - Yes? Please keep the noise down, Selma. Is that you, Mother? Which verbs take the ablative absolute? You do care for me, don't you? Darling, I'm so afraid. Never leave me again. Never! Help me! Just help me! Bertha! I have to put you to death. You're too weak in the dead languages. When you're dead, you'll feel more at home. Bertha. My poor little darling! Mummy will help you. I'll help you into bed. You can't lie on the floor. I'll help you up. You guessed quite right. I am afraid. It's like I have a burning white spot in my brain... that drives me to devise certain things. But it's myself that I frighten most of all. Like now, when I come here to scare you. More brandy? I've feared death only once. It was a cat, actually. Funny, really. I've always been fond of cats. A big cat was basking in the sun in front of a house. I went up to it, talked to it sweetly. It purred and rubbed against me. I bent down and stroked its back. Suddenly it bit my hand. It went berserk. It dug all its claws into my hand. It clung on tight, sinking its teeth into my hand. I'll never forget the panic I felt. I think I screamed. You know what I did? I dunked my hand, cat and all, into a barrel of water. Like this. The cat clung to my arm like a vise. It drowned, but without ever releasing its grip. A doctor had to cut it loose. I still have the scars. Look. I don't want to! That's the way to be, all right. Never lose your grip. If you don't bite, I will. According to observations, this occurs approximately one week later than in the south. - I have to speak to you! - It's a free country. - Don't be angry with me. - I am angry with you. I want nothing to do with you. - Good day. - Good day, Widgren. How are you? You were -- - I'm well, thank you. So you know the girl from the tobacco shop. - Do you know her well? - No. - Not at all? - A little. Tell me: Is she a nice girl, really? I don't know. Why? There aren't many days left before finals. Six, I believe. This heat is trying. Takes the life out of us all. Is it going to go on like this, I wonder. Volo, nolo, malo... Bertha. I didn't do it! I didn't do it. He's going to report me. Police. - I didn't do it. - Was it you who called? - I didn't do it. - What's your name? Please calm down, sir. I can't release you until the cause of death has been confirmed. This is crazy! I'm not a criminal! Do you think I am? I'm not a criminal! Calm down, sir. Just drink this. This is all just a formality. Come with me. You should lie down for a moment. I wouldn't hurt a fly. I'm so afraid, Inspector. I've been ill. You mustn't frighten me. Calm down, sir. Lie down and try to get some sleep. I'll call you as soon as the report comes in. I'll just take these. She must have neglected her health terribly. I don't know how one can drink oneself to death, but she did. - Coupled with a weak heart -- - And malnutrition. Better call the police, so that wreck of a schoolmaster can go home and sleep. Will do. You may go, sir. Quite a relief, isn't it? I'm so sorry we had to do this to you. Good-bye, sir. Good-bye, Officer. Would you wait outside, please. Show Widgren in. Well, this is a sorry business, Widgren. The Latin teacher has made a number of serious charges against you. I've made note of them and would like to hear your version. Sit down, Widgren. One morning your Latin teacher sees you with a girl, Bertha Olsson. She worked in the tobacco shop. Knowing the girl is of questionable reputation, he seeks her out to ask her to stay away from you and plead with her to change her ways. She laughs and swears at him and generally behaves improperly. She was drinking brandy. Suddenly, she clutches her heart and falls down dead. Soon thereafter, before he had recovered from the shock, you arrive, opening the door with your own key. Finding the girl dead, you accuse him of murder and rush off. Well, Widgren, what do you say to that? Do you believe any of that yourself, sir? I don't believe anything. That is -- Yes, it's true. I was seeing a girl who may not have had the best reputation. That, coupled with your cheating, would be enough to expel you. - Do you realize that? - Yes, and I don't care. I see. However, that's not the only matter at hand. I want to know if the rest is true. I mean how it happened. So you're not so sure? Please answer my question and refrain from any personal reflections. Would you repeat the question to the person who made the charges? I won't do that. I can't. Very well. I'll do it. Will you swear that your charges are in accordance with the truth? Mr. Widgren has asked me to put the question to you in his presence. What reason would I have to lie? It's true that my statements cannot be checked. But why would I get Widgren expelled if not for educational reasons? Can't we try to resolve this, for Widgren's sake? "Educational reasons"! - You killed her! - Easy, Widgren! You frightened her to death! You tormented her, got her drunk and tortured her! - Like you torture all of us! - I must protest! You scared her to death! If I'm expelled, then he should be expelled a hundred times over! You old pervert! Is this a bad time? - Do you want something? - Not exactly. - Then please wait outside. - But -- Please. If you say so. Enough now! Widgren, wait outside. Have you taken leave of your senses, boy? Don't you realize I can't help you now? I wonder which of you bears the greatest guilt. What do you mean? We'll be forced to commit an injustice. But there's no getting around it, unless you'd consider withdrawing your charges. No, I won't consider that. Will you have it on your conscience that you ruined the boy's future? Hurry! We're trying on graduation caps! I won't be needing one. Widgren! Why didn't you come to us, my boy? Why didn't you tell us? Why? Expelled. Like your mother says, why didn't you tell us? What would I have said? I suppose your mother and I deserve this. We thought -- Oh, never mind. Say it, Father. You thought you'd be proud of me. Isn't that it? Let's speak of it no more. What's done is done. Your mother and I will just have to get over it. I suppose you will! - What's this tone of voice? - It's always you and Mother, isn't it? You're offended. You're disappointed. You'll have to get over it. What about me? You couldn't care less! I don't care about you! You've never cared about me! I'm not staying! You won't have to be ashamed of me. You certainly talk big! You don't believe me, Father? How could you? Don't go! My darling boy, you mustn't go! You mustn't! Everything will be all right. Please don't go! Everyone passed! Well, boys... this period in your life has now come to an end. You'll now step out and see what life has to offer. I hope you will do your old school proud. Try to see it for what it is: a strict parent and exacting mentor. Perhaps not always fair, and perhaps not all it should be. But it has one thing that I dare vouch for: a sincere and honest desire to mould you -- A sincere and honest desire to mould you into good, able and useful citizens. It is my sincere hope that it has succeeded in this important task. All that now remains are the farewells. We, your old taskmasters, wish you happiness and success. I hardly need tell you that, do I? All the best, Bergman. All the best, Kjellgren... Swine! Amen. What will you do now? I don't know. I feel like I'm going mad. I need to think. You're desperate, buddy. Tell me about it. No. See you around. Are you going to live here in Bertha's room? Where else? Thanks for coming. She had a hard time. You see, I -- I understand. - Do you really? - Yes. You know, all that Nietzsche and Strindberg... all that rubbish I said about women. I don't believe it anymore. You see, I've become -- Come with me. You can't live here alone, damn it! No. I want to be alone. See ya. - Is that you, Widgren? - Yes. Would you mind if I came in? No. Could we perhaps have a little light? I've been wanting to talk to you. Sandman told me where you were, so I thought I'd come by. You didn't like school, did you? Or rather, you didn't quite fit in. Isn't that so? I can understand that. Our school system doesn't suit everybody. What do you want? You think criticizing school will help me? I'll tell you what I want. I want you to go home to your parents. They're so worried. - Are they! - Yes, they are. - And I'd like to help you if I can. - No one can help me. Not with your inner problems. Like everyone else, you'll have to bear those all on your own. But there's something else that needs sorting out for which I feel partly responsible. Oh? And what would that be? You've cut yourself off from society. You're running away in sheer desperation. However strange this may sound, it's your old school's fault, and I'd like to make up for it. No, I can't reverse your expulsion. But I promise to do all I can to help you in other ways. I have to try to stop you. Bring you back among people. Do you understand, my dear boy? Promise to come see me at my house tomorrow. We'll talk more then. All right, but please go now. Promise you won't do anything foolish. Here. Here's a little money. Get a hotel room for the night. Try to get some sleep. Time passes. One day you'll be able to look back on this without pain. Maybe you'll even learn from it. You see, I believe that there's a meaning to everything that happens, even though it may seem unlikely in our eyes. Good-bye, my boy. What are you doing here? You want to go inside? Here's the key. Take it. The headmaster was here. What did he say? - We didn't talk about you. - I know he said something about me. Widgren... I didn't want this to happen. Listen to me. I've been ill. I still am very ill. I can't help it. You must know I didn't do it deliberately. I have nobody. Four walls, bookshelves, a bed, a desk, a cleaning woman, schoolboys and waitresses! But no one that wants me. May I go now? Nobody wants anything to do with me. They laugh at me or run away. They're afraid of me too. But I'm the one who's most afraid. Turn on the light, Widgren! You can't leave me alone! Widgren! Turn on the light! Stay with me!
