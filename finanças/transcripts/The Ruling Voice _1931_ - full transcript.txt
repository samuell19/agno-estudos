Say, Palmetto. Lay off from buying for Bailey & Son. They are on the blacklist. What's it matter to me? Bailey is my friend. I have been doing business with him for fifteen years. Alright. But I'm telling you Bailey & Son are on the blacklist. Listen. I run my business. I run it square. Besides, I buy all my stock from where it is the cheapest and the best. Okay. Suit yourself. Hello Palmetto. Where you been these last few days? I bring along some choice berries for you and you don't show up. You are on the blacklist Bailey for not paying protection money. The business is being shot all to pieces. Losing all my best customers. You'd better pay. No use bucking it. I lost two trucks last week for trying. But I don't make enough money to pay. Boost your prices. Everybody else does. Alright Joe. This pays you up for another month. You won't have any trouble getting your stuff. Goodbye. The monthly report of our collections, Mr Bannister. Complete for last month, eh? Not enough, Sneed. It's an increase of two and a half millions over the previous month. The government figures over a billion was paid into rackets last year. This year it will be bigger. We are not getting our share. That's what I've been telling you for a long time. I remember when I used to worry about spending an extra nickel for lunch. Come in. All the directors are here, sir. - Alright. Keep that financial report under cover. I'll tell the men all they need to know. Got the dividend checks? Morning, boys. - Morning. Good morning. Everybody here? Everybody here but Joslyn, eh? Too bad about Joslyn. He got a swell head. Thought he could beat the System. Too bad. Anybody else got a swell head? No? Well, that's a healthy sign. You take a cut this time, Artesti. You know why. You know that Minerva gang with their grape juice racket has got pretty big. So what do we do when a racket gets big? We take it over and merge it into the System. Now get busy. Well Blackton, that flood down south sure cracked your division on the chin. But I'm not penalising you. Even our business is subject to the acts of God. Have your district manager give generously to the relief fund. But chief, how will we do that? - Alright. Get it back later on the contracts for rebuilding. In the meantime I guess we won't starve. So you listened to me and it came out alright, didn't it. That's all. You know, sometimes this game of ours scares me. It's like a snowball rolling down a hill. It keeps getting bigger and bigger. Well, you're pushing the snowball, aren't you? Yeah. No matter how fast it rolls or how big it gets, I've got to keep pushing it. Statements, schedules, details. Details, always details. First thing I know I'll be a machine like you, Sneed. I haven't seen my daughter in years. She sends me a message and you put it on the bottom of the pile. Those were your orders: important business first. Now run along and attend to your own important business. Abner. Don't call me Abner. I've got to write a message. I've got to think of something nice to say. I haven't had much experience in saying nice things. Gee, he's a peach. You'll like him. - He'd better like me. Just think, Dick. I haven't been home in ten years. You haven't? After other died, father shipped me to Europe for school. Good for father. I wouldn't have met you otherwise. Good for me too. I've beaten you. So. You'll be getting acquainted with your father and won't have time for me? No. We'll have lots of time together. The three of us. - Yep. I'm going to have a lot of fun looking for a job. Oh, hark. Dick Cheney is not really going to work? - Sure. I've got to. I am broke. So is mother. She tried outguessing the stock market. Now the Cheney fortune is just a memory. And it even costs money to get a marriage licence. Has the eminent Dexter Burroughs arrived? He was on time to the minute. - Well, I'm ready for him. Send him in. So you had better tune in. Is the microphone open? Yeah. Glad to meet you, Mr Burroughs. Won't you sit down? Thank you. Mr Burroughs, you are a member of a certain group of business leaders .. Who believe that I am a menace to their industrial welfare. That I and my system should be crushed and exterminated. Why, we thought .. That your plans were a secret? And so they are to everyone except myself. Your committee is meeting today to draw up a plan of battle. I must protect my interest by having a trusted representative .. On that committee to keep me informed as to how I am to be exterminated. So Mr Burroughs, I have drafted you for the job. What? Why, you're crazy. You haven't forgot the very questionable railway merger you made a few years ago. You made a mistake. You wrote several letters regarding that deal and signed your name to them. Perhaps you'd like to see the letters? Just to prove that I am not bluffing. Thousands of stockholders will very much like to know what became of their money. Go ahead. Go ahead. That's alright. Destroy them. They are only photostatic copies. I have the originals in our vault. Why, this is blackmail. No, no. Not blackmail. Just a request for a little service. Work with your committee against me. Vote for whatever plan they may adopt. But keep me informed. I will not. Is that clear? The first information that I want is the names of the other men on the committee. Then, your plan of attack. Phone me. Just dial: R-E-R-0-1-9-7 Don't wait for an answer. When you hear a sharp click .. Start talking. It won't be necessary for you to write down the number. You will remember it. R-E-R. 0-1-9-7. Perhaps I'd better keep those here. They might fall into the wrong hands. Your meeting is at ten-thirty isn't it? Gentlemen, we represent major industries doing business all over this country. You all have heard the name Jack Banister, haven't you. You might not know him, Waite. But all of us who live here know him as a successful building contractor. A reputable businessman. His contracting business is only a cloak for his real business. Every industry we represent is paying Jack Bannister. He is the head of the System we have been investigating. We all know that a veritable army of gangsters is devastating the country. But the biggest ones you read about are only Sergeants in the Army. Jack Bannister is the General. But so skilfully has he been protected by his System. That it's taken us six months to discover his identity. And now that we know who he is ..? - We are going after him. And Andrew Gregory is going to lead us in our fight. But he hasn't said he would accept. Gentlemen. I am at your service. - Good. That's very kind of you. I am sure we are all very grateful to you. Now gentlemen, I have a request to make. We know that the word of each one of you is as good as his bond. But owing to the extreme seriousness of this fight. I will ask each of you to sign this pledge of .. Secrecy. Good. That's an excellent idea. Present at today's meeting. Were myself. Dexter Burroughs. Say, there ought to be an answer on 0197. Yep. Here it is. A nice permanent record of how he betrayed his friends. Right on the dot. Smart fellow. Sensible. He might be a good man for us. Well, let's hear what he has to say. "Present at today's meeting." "Were myself, Dexter Burroughs .." "And." "And." [ Gunshot! ] Well, I guess that's all there is on that record. A great man. Wouldn't betray his friends. Destroy everything we have in the files on Burroughs. Why? Someday, somebody might want to build a monument to him. Who attended that meeting? You double-checked and had a man follow Burroughs didn't you? Is Johnson back yet? - "Yes, sir." Bring me in his report. Seven men went to the meeting. He recognised five of them. Hmm. Big stuff. A choice collection. I wonder what Andrew Gregory was doing there. Probably acting as advisor. We couldn't have any more powerful opposition. The greatest compliment we ever had. When you're big enough to have these eagles after you, you're big. Ha-ha. Excuse me, Sneed. Was that meant to be a laugh? Do that again, will you. Everybody living has some sort of affliction. But you've got the worst I've ever heard of. Worse than smallpox. You can't laugh. It is my office. Gregory wants an appointment. He doesn't believe in wasting time. Neither do I. Alright. He's got his appointment. Tell Mr Gregory to come right over. Good morning, Mr Bannister. Mr Gregory, I'm always glad to meet men I admire. Thank you. - Won't you sit down. Mr Bannister. I am here in the interest of The Consolidated Dairy Products Company. Good. It's a fine company. Prosperous. Makes lots of money. And if it wasn't for me and my system you think it would make a lot more, eh? Exactly. You say you represent The Consolidated? I know what happened at that meeting today. The Consolidated was only one of six companies represented. Now let's go over this thing. Milk is a daily necessity. And The Consolidated, which does business in about 15 states .. And serves about 12 million customers. Pay us a lot of protection money. So, if you refuse to pay, I fight. If you can beat me in the milk racket .. That'll give the others courage to attack me and put me out of business. Isn't that your plan? I'm not here to declare war, Mr Bannister. I want your friendly cooperation. "The cost of living is too high. Your system is one of the reasons." "I'm going to ask you to stop demanding payments from The Consolidated Dairies." They will then reduce the price of milk. Life will be easier for millions of people. I agree with that Consolidated should cut their prices. But we'll demand our service charge just the same. Doesn't your conscience ever hurt you? I haven't got any. See, I admit it. I guess I am this country's most honest dishonest man. Well, if I can't shame you into it, make me a proposition. What will you take to abandon your system? Abolish it. Name the price that you would accept .. To take your hands off the neck of America's business. Price? I haven't got a price. I don't care for money. I never did. Then you must want power? That's it. Power. I've got an awful appetite for it. And I don't mean to stop trying to get all I want. It's a tough life but it's great. I love it. It's exciting. Then it will be my job to see that you don't get any more power. Well, that's a tough job for you. But it is exciting too. Say, if we can't be friends .. I don't know anybody I'd rather fight with. So the battle is on. Mr Bannister. Consolidated Dairy Products refuses to meet your next demand for payment. Say, you don't want to fight with me. It won't pay you. - No. I don't want to. It can't be helped. [ Buzzer ] "An important phone call for Mr Gregory." Thank you. Yes? Burroughs? Suicide? Why, that's impossible. What? Yes. Yes. Yes. I will come at once. Not Dexter Burroughs? Yes. Too bad. A fine man. I .. That's alright. Don't let me detain you. Our business can wait. Thank you. - Thanks for coming. "Yes, sir?" Have Mrs Stanton shown into the reception room. Look here, Jack. I don't like visitors unless I know what they want. Now be careful. After all these years you are warning me about a woman. Why, you tell everyone to be as tough with women as with men. You always say that men have trawled for women since Eve slipped Adam that apple. I'm safe. I don't like apples. Good morning, Mrs Stanton. - Good morning. Nice of you to see me. Not at all. I know you must be awfully busy so I'll try to forget I'm a woman. And be brief. Busy men always have time when they want it. You were wondering who I am and why I came? Why you came, yes. But I know very well who you are. Oh. "Mr Bannister, I am building the Stephanie Apartments on the Avenue." And in going over costs with my contractor. I discovered that ten percent of my money is going to racketeers. To "ensure unmolested construction". We're not exactly racketeers. It's a service charge. But 12 percent I believe is the customary figure. Horrors. Well, I don't want to pay it. I don't blame you. - That's why I came to you. I know you are the one man who can protect me. Who told you that? A little bird. A mockingbird? "Or perhaps it was a parrot repeating something he heard?" "No. An owl." "Well, I am afraid your wise old owl has been misinformed." I pay the regular fee on my own buildings. Then you have no pity on me? None whatever. But I know quite a good deal about construction. And I would be very glad to see that you get a good building. Mr Bannister, I know you are at the head of that horrid system. You do? But you're not a bit as I thought you would be. I came here all of a tremble .. Expecting to find some sort of a dragon with long fangs. And fire spitting out of his mouth. But you are so pleasant and good natured. That's only on the surface. Underneath, I'm a tough customer. Hmm. Tough enough to make me pay a lot of money. [ Telephone ] Pardon me. Yes? Oh, the Europa is docking? Good. Is my car ready? I'm sorry Mrs Stanton but I have to go. My daughter has returned from school in Europe. I haven't seen her for years. I've almost got stage fright. Isn't that exciting. I know how you feel for I was separated once from my son for six months. I'll dash. Awfully nice seeing you. If I can help you with that building, you let me know. I will hold you to that promise. Jack, will you look at these before you go. No. When will you be back? - None of your business. I don't like that Stanton woman. I don't blame you after what she called you. What? - You heard. She thought she was meeting you. You were the dragon with fangs and a mouth sprouting fire she talked about. I'll drop in to see you this afternoon. - I'll be waiting. Hello, Charlie. Daddy! Well. Well, here you are. Daddy, I am so happy. I've simply got to tell you something. - Yes? I'm going to be married. That's a nice thing to spring on me. We've hardly seen each other in years. And now you tell me you're going to get married and leave me again. Oh, I am not going to leave you again .. ever. Well, you can't blame me for feeling a little selfish about you, you know. Who is he? Dick Cheney. Cheney? Yes. His father was Culver Cheney, the banker who died three years ago. Say, that's the stuff. That family is one of the first fifty of the 400, isn't it. Yes. He has got lots of family, poor dear. Well, do they know about this? I mean his mother. Do you know her? Dick is going to tell his mother this afternoon. He came over on the boat with me and .. Well, we decided not to have any introductions at the dock. Why? We thought it would be nicer and .. What's the matter, daddy? You are not angry because I'm engaged? Why, of course not, honey. I'm tickled to death. These 400 families are something like royalty. They like to marry among themselves. Nobody else is good enough for them. We're good enough for anybody aren't we? I've never felt that anyone was any better than I am. That's the way to feel. Everything is going to be alright. It's got to be. You think she'll like it? - Who wouldn't? I don't think it would look so well on you. No. You've wasted the whole day. This is swell outfit. Everything goes to pot if I take a day off. Stop cracking the whip and let me alone. Go on. Get out of here. Well, what's next? Several cases to try. Let them sweat while I look over the charges against them. What's the gag? You guys been here before? Nope. First time. There ain't no second time. What's going to happen? Plenty. You'll find out, brother. You're going up against the big boy. The chief of the works. What does he look like? - Oh, how should I know? Only the smart guys at the top of the racket know what he looks like. Or even know who he is. And you won't see him today. Haven't you ever heard of a guy being up against "The Voice"? Sure. But I didn't know what it meant. His voice is all you hear. All you see. They ain't taking chances with some nut going twisty and taking a pot at him. Bailey. Bailey, you are a double-crosser. The worst thing that crawls. But I will give you a chance to alibi yourself if you can. What have you got to say? Sure, I double-crossed you. Whoever you are. Why not? I had a good Produce business. Because I wouldn't pay you busted my business and ruined me. And because I had no business .. And no job I was put to work doing to other guys what had been done to me. My son who had been in the Produce business with me went out for himself. Part of my job was to get him in the system too. He said they would never make him pay. I argued with him. I told him it was no use to fight. He went crazy and began protecting his property with a gun. He was shot. Your rotten System. Killed my boy. And I had .. helped you to do it. Then I went crazy too. I organised a bunch to fight you. I thought I could beat you. Last night some of your men slipped me into a car and slugged me. When I came to I was in this place. And you can take me over the road if you want to. You killed my boy. Go ahead and kill me. Go ahead! He crippled the Produce racket. It cost us a couple of hundred thousand. Make an example of him. Well he has already got his. He deserves it. He ain't worth a nickel. He's broken, whipped. He'll suffer more alive than dead. Bailey. We're through with you. You're on probation. But you keep out of your district from now on. Understand? We'll keep an eye on you always. Alright. Get him out of here and hustle those other guys in. I got something I want to do. Clayton. We've just given Ed Bailey the works. The chief thinks he's whipped but I think he is still dangerous. Anyhow, you had better keep an eye on him. One .. two .. three. Four. Oh. Oh it's beautiful, daddy. [ French language ] Now you are taking unfair advantage of me. I'm not up on that French talk. I can't wait to show it to Dick. Oh. He promised to drop over for cocktails before dinner. Daddy .. you will be extra nice to Dick, won't you. He'll be a little scared meeting you for the first time. You want me to be nice to a fella that's going to take my daughter away from me? Not much. You just try and act like an old bear. Besides, I don't believe you can. Oh, I can't eh? Well you ought to see me sometime. Where? Well, at the office. Daddy, what is your business? Who wants to know? I do. You have never told me .. and I .. And Dick Cheney's mother wants to know, eh? She is awfully nice, really. Dick told me all about her. After all, it's only a natural question for a mother to ask. I feel a little ashamed, not knowing. Maybe you'd be ashamed if I told you. What do you think I am? A banker? That's what you want me to be, eh? - Are you? Well, a kind-of a banker, yes. What bank do you own, daddy? Own? Say .. I didn't expect you were going to ask me about my business. Oh. So that is one of the things a young girl shouldn't know, eh? Well, I'm in a funny business. It is kinda hard to explain. It's .. You are my daughter. You've got a right to know. Why, it sounds exciting. - It is. Someday you'll probably find out. And whoever tells you, might make it seem stranger than it really is. It might give you the wrong impression. I am as curious as a cat. Well, before your mother died, I .. I lost my business. The one your grandfather started. I refused to go with a gang of grafters and take a lot of the public's money. So they got after me and .. Cleaned me out. I failed at trying to be honest, so I .. Decided to be a success at being .. What some people would call dishonest. Others call it. Clever. Now I am the head of an organisation built principally on bluff. We bluff men and business firms out of money. They pay us to protect their business. If they don't .. We make it awful hot for them until they come through or go broke like I did. It's called a "racket". Racketeering. Kind of a back door to fame and fortune. It is .. I can't believe that you would .. Then this and all the rest you've given me .. My education and everything has all been bought with .. That kind of money? Yes. But with Dick and his mother .. It's all pretty horrible, isn't it. You didn't want me to lie to you, did you Gloria? I'm afraid I am not as brave as you. But I wish you hadn't told me. No .. I don't mean that. It sort of changes my whole life, doesn't it. It's Dick. I can't see him now. I can't. Yes. You must see him. It is best. I'll come back in a few minutes. Here I am, back again. See, you can't get rid of me. Hello, Dick. Gloria. Has anything happened? I can't marry you, Dick. Don't ask me why. It would .. It would have been so much better if we had never met. If we had never met? Gloria. I will ring when I am ready, Anna. - Yes, sir. Gloria, I don't see what .. You must give me some reason. Gloria. Father. This is Dick Cheney. Glad to meet you, Dick. Glad to meet you, Mr Bannister. Nothing like a woman's tears to upset a fellow, is there. No, sir. Mr Bannister. Gloria has just broken our engagement. Yes? She didn't give me the reason so .. I was wondering if it is because you took exception to me. Because you didn't want her to marry me. Not at all, Dick. Well then, Gloria. Now see here, both of you. Please Gloria, I think it is only fair. I've told you, Dick. I can't marry you. That is all there is to it. She is protecting me, Dick. Gloria. You see, Dick. This marriage doesn't seem to hinge on you and Gloria as it should. Because your mother had to know you were marrying into the right kind of family. Is that true? - Well she did ask, but .. Well, you asked Gloria and Gloria asked me and I told her. I'm sorry if I have .. - There's nothing wrong with my family. There is something about me and my business that Gloria objects to. And I guess she is right. Please, father. We don't have to go into that. Yes we do. We have to go into everything. Aren't you going to tell Dick why you are ashamed of me? I am not going to tell Dick anything. Please go, Dick. I want you to go. It all seems so crazy, so absurd to me. Why, you act as if your father was some sort of criminal. I am, to Gloria. I .. I am not going to live on money gotten that way. I'm ashamed of everything I have. I'm going out tomorrow to earn my own living. And I won't have either of you interfering with me. Gloria. - Please, Dick. Listen to me. I love you. I'm not responsible for my family any more than you are for your father. I haven't a cent now, but I can work too. It is nothing new. People have done it before. When I can support you we'll get married and .. Goodnight, Mr Bannister. Dinner is served, sir. Thank you, Merrick. The young folks have gone out. I will eat alone. I'm sorry you are leaving me, Hood. But if you can do better elsewhere. Thank you, Madam. I shall be sorry to leave. Oh Hood, I'm expecting a Mr Bannister. Very good, madam. Hello, darling. Now be a good boy Malcolm and don't fall in the pond. I won't mother. Mr Bannister. Good morning, Mrs Stanton. Nice to see you again. - Thank you. Malcolm, this is Mr Bannister. How do you do, Mr Bannister. I'm her little boy. Oh, that's fine. Goodbye, dear. - Goodbye, mother. Come, Malcolm. Won't you sit down? Thank you. It's not very considerate of me to disturb you so early. I've been wondering why you asked to drop in. I came to the conclusion you are really the nice man I thought you were. And have found a way to save me all that money on my new building. I'm not a nice man at all. And you know it. Consequently, I am in trouble. You in trouble? I can't believe it. Should I be sorry or glad? Please be sorry. It will be a new experience for me. Yesterday, you asked a favor of me. I refused it. Today I am going to ask one of you and I hope you'll grant it. Mrs Stanton. You have probably observed that I think I am a pretty wise guy. Well, maybe I am in business, but .. At home .. I'm a dud. Your daughter? Right the first time. That is your womanly intuition. The only thing the Lord held out on men. He made up for it by making them so big and strong. Yes, I tried being big and strong with my daughter yesterday. It didn't work. I told her the truth about myself. She is leaving me. - Leaving you? Yes. She is going out to hear her own living. She is ashamed of me. And That hurts? That is how big and strong I am. What can I do to help? An awful lot if you will. I'd like to see that she gets work in a place where I know she'll be alright. And I thought perhaps that .. You might be able to use her as a sort of French tutor to your boy. You see, she hasn't spoken anything but French in years. And .. I'll be glad to take her. It will be sort-of fun to have a young girl around. That's the nicest thing anyone ever did for me. I thought we could put an Ad in the paper. You know: "Young lady tutor wanted." And I would manage to see that she sees it. You'll probably be flooded with applicants. I don't mind that. But how will I know her? That's right. She might change her name. There is her picture. She is lovely. I will know her. But why do you want her with me? You must know dozens of other women. - But I don't. I've been so close to business. Too much of a machine for any social friends. And it is just my luck to be fortunate enough to meet someone .. As nice and as charming and considerate and as sweet and lovely .. Enough. After that pretty speech I couldn't refuse if I wanted to. I forgot to tell you. She is engaged to marry young Dick Cheney. Culver Cheney's boy. Oh .. I see. Now I think you understand the whole story. I'll take good care of her. Thanks don't mean a thing but .. Thanks. Fr?re Jacques. Fr?re Jacques, Fr?re Jacques. Dormez-vous? Dormez-vous? Sonnez les matines! Sonnez les matines! Ding, dang, dong. Ding, dang, dong. Amazing. And in so short a time too. I think you will have to take me for a pupil. My French is so rusty it creeks. Do you really think I've done well? - I surely do. You know I am so glad. I've tried awfully hard. You were so nice to take me without any recommendation. And not knowing me from Adam. [ Telephone ] Yes, Marley? Who? A Mr Richard Cheney to see me? I'll be right down. I have a young man caller. Do I look alright? Lovely. Dick. I thought you had deserted America entirely. Hello, Mrs Stanton. - I'm glad to see you. How are you? - Awfully well, Dick. How is your mother? She is awfully well too. How have you been? - Splendid, thanks. You are well. Your mother is well. We are all well. Yes. Gloria Bannister is working here isn't she? Gloria Bannister? You mean Malcolm's new French teacher? - Yes. Your French is perfect, Dick. You don't need any lessons. No. I want to marry her. Oh, I see. And you want me to ask her? No. We are engaged. That means I want to marry her doesn't it? Then you didn't want to see me at all? Oh yes, I did. But you want to see Gloria too? I'd love to. I've got a job selling bonds. I've simply got to tell her. Come along this once. But after this, outside of office hours. - I promise. You don't want to buy any bonds, do you? - Not one. Le soldat. Le chien. Le crayon. If you'll wait here. Miss Bannister. This is Mr Richard Cheney. Be careful. He is a salesman. Hello, Dick. - Well? You can't lord it over me anymore now, young lady. I've got a job too. - A real one? No. A bond salesman. The kind of work they give strong-bodied athletes and weak-minded sons. But it is a start. Amusing, isn't it. - Very. Smoke? - Yes. Any news? What's happened? Miracles. - Pardon? I think Bannister is fascinating. And his daughter is actually living in my house. Mary, you are not for a moment serious? You don't believe in miracles, eh? Well, this one is true. And he adores her. And she's left her father's fireside. And he likes me. Come out in the foyer and I'll explain all the headlines. Good morning. Morning. Listen, Sneed. Do you know that outside the sun is shining? - No. Say, I want you to call off any men you've got shadowing Mary Stanton. I've just gone over the report on her. - Never mind that. She did me a personal favor. I think she is alright. You mean because she is taking your daughter in? Well, she is taking you in too. She is working for Gregory. Is that so? I've always been suspicious of it and now I have the proof. In the past two weeks she has been to ten social affairs. And though the other guests are never the same .. Gregory is always there. Very clever of you, Sherlock. Ordinarily I'd say you were right. But I've a very good reason for having my daughter with Mary Stanton. I'll handle this. You call off your men. You are seeing too much of her too. Since when has the president of the outfit to be shadowed? Since you started letting a woman lead you around by the nose. Well, it hasn't made it sore. But if I catch any of your snoopers following me .. Crane. How many men have you got shadowing Mary Stanton? Two? Double it. Delivered by special messenger. You are feeling pretty happy, ain't you? Sure. It's great. Try it some time. Well, grin at that. Gregory says The Consolidated Dairies refuse to make the payment due tomorrow. Now, what are you going to do about it? Call a meeting of the board of directors right away. Boys. I started this System in one little office over on Cedar Street. Now we are a national organisation. Big and powerful, getting stronger all the time. I formulated the code. I've made every important decision for the past ten years. Now I'm going to give you boys a chance to decide. Consolidated have refused to pay. If You decide to fight. The plan of battle is all worked out. If we decide? It's your job to decide. I said we are fully prepared for war. You can go ahead without me. Everything will function just the same. What do you mean: go ahead without you? What I said. I am going to resign. - What? You are going to what? Jack .. are you kidding us? Resign now? When we are faced with one of the biggest problems in our careers? I'm through. You boys can handle the organisation. Do with it what you want to. Now I know you are crazy. Jack. You can't do that. We need you. We've got to have you. Why in heaven's name do you want to walk out on us now? If I tell you the truth you'll laugh at me probably. But I am going to tell you. I am resigning on account of my daughter. Your daughter? Yes. She is the only person in this world that I happen to care about. She despises me because I am mixed up in a filthy business. Well, I can't do anything about the past but I can do something about the future. So you want to quit on account of your daughter? Why that is the saddest and funniest thing I ever heard. You. The man who pounded it into us that The System was bigger than all of us. So that's why you want to quit. Well, we all have daughters. And sons and wives too. You remember that India River bridge job? I didn't want to touch because I ran the risk of going to jail for life. I've got a wife and daughter. Remember what you told me about the dividing line? Between our business and our personal lives? Oh, we are all in the same boat. I've got two fine children. Yet you didn't hesitate to send me off to clean up that mess in Detroit. For a week I tagged between machine-gun bullets and the electric chair. Isn't that right? You made the code and you have got to stand by it. You never spared us and I don't see why we should spare you. So you want to quit, eh? And leave us holding the bag. Well, you've picked a good time. Yeah. Just before the fireworks start. You want to pull out of the biggest fight that we've ever had. Oh, no you don't. You can't back down out of this now. You started this and you've got to finish it. Alright, let's get it over with as soon as possible. Get hold of Taylor. Tell him to use the plan of attack that worked last week. Tell him to go with everything he's got. In 24 hours the Consolidated will be so tied up .. That not one drop of milk will get in this town. It's war, Steve. May the best man win and we'd better be the best. Get him on the line. Hurry up .. Hello. - Hello. You must be terribly busy with your war. A little more than usual. But we are pretty well organised to handle situations of this kind. I said things about you this morning at breakfast. - Yes? When I had to eat my cereal dry. Well, it will soon be over. I think our opponents realize they made a mistake. Haven't you made a mistake? I don't think so. How? I am one of your opponents. Really? You laugh at me as you know by admitting it I must be a pretty weak opponent, eh? The strongest one I ever had. I mean it. You trusted me, didn't you. Perfectly. I still do. So did they. Your other opponents. Yet here am I betraying their trust to warn you of a danger. I'm always in danger, I am used to it. But it is not you, in it. Gloria? Where is she? She's alright now. She's in the park with Malcolm. She'll be safe until 6 o'clock. - And what happens to her at 6 o'clock? Unless I can prevail upon you to call off this milk war she'll be taken away. Held. Heaven knows what will happen to her. Where's your phone? I can stop that. Of course you can. That is why I told you. In the few weeks she has been with me I have grown to love her. I couldn't stand by and see her made to suffer because of .. Because of me. Yes. I guess you already know what I think of you. It is what you think of her that counts now. I can protect Gloria. But I can't stop this fight until we win. I thought I knew men but you have fooled me completely. I even thought you liked me. I do even though I don't dare to. Why? Because I'm Jack Bannister the man whose daughter and many people are ashamed of. I'm not ashamed of you. You should be. Because I ran true to form. I've followed The System even with you. While you thought you were tricking me I was actually tricking you. Gregory tried to beat me at my own game. He didn't have a chance. After your first visit to my office I put two and two together and checked up. I found out that he had sent you. I found out all about you. When Gloria left me, I decided she would be safer with you than with anyone else. Knowing that I was an enemy? Certainly. I knew it was only natural for my enemies .. To strike at me through my daughter so I put her where she could not be harmed. But you put her with me. Purposely. You were the finest woman I'd ever met. I knew you couldn't help but like Gloria and take care of her. That was only one reason. The other was that as you had a son that I could reach. No harm could possibly come to Gloria. She has been watched every minute. Your old butler was offered a new job at a better salary. To get him away. Your present butler is one of my men. You wouldn't really harm my son? You say you love Gloria. But no better than you do your own son. Would you hesitate to protect him first? It is inconceivable. Like the dark ages, not the 20th century. It is The System. True, I started it, but now it's gotten bigger than I am. I wouldn't admit that to anybody else in this world. You mean you can't control it if you want to? You can't stop it with a word? Not with every word in the dictionary. Well, what are we going to do? When Andrew Gregory suggested I go into this thing I accepted eagerly. It promised adventure, excitement, a lot of fun. But now, I and my son. We have been swept into the underworld. Jack Bannister. Promise me that nothing will happen to either Malcolm or Gloria. They must be pulled out of this mess somehow. Nothing should happen to either of them. But unfortunately, it is up to you. It is rather pitiful to see a fine man go down to defeat. To find that after years of corrupting others, he has corrupted himself. Grown afraid of a monstrous system of his own creation. Become a coward. A coward? I've been called everything but that. What a great man you might have been. Is it too late? I'm afraid it is. Well. Out goes the devil. Hello, Gloria. Hello, father. Where is Malcolm? The nurse has taken him upstairs. What was my father doing here? He came to see me, dear. He is a friend of mine. A friend? - Yes. A friend .. in a strange way. That's why you came here to work. We arranged it all between us. Then you know .. - I know all about him. His business, why you left him. Everything. Oh, how terrible. I've made a terrible mistake, Gloria. And you must listen bravely and carefully. While I tell you everything. It's time to do something drastic. I shall not ask you to wait until after 6 o'clock. If, by then .. Bannister doesn't cease hostilities. We will carry out our first attack. He said he was powerless to do anything else. I went into this thing for excitement. Well, I got it. Six o'clock. Six o'clock. I can't believe it. Here in my own home. It's like a death sentence. My own father is the executioner. Ridiculous. If it weren't true. But then through it all, I find myself feeling sorry for him. I'm not sorry for him. He is cruel, merciless. But nothing is going to happen to you or Malcolm. You're coming with me. - Where? I'll tell you upstairs. Marley, you can tell your real employer .. That Miss Bannister, Malcolm and myself have gone to his, Mr Bannister's home. He might be interested and you might get promoted. Yes, madam. This Marley. On the Stanton job. Give me headquarters. From now on Merrick you do as I say. Don't go near the phone and don't let anyone in. Hello, Merrick. Is Miss Gloria in there? - Yes, sir. I'll be in here if you need me. Gloria. Whose idea was this bringing Mrs Stanton and her boy here? Mine. I don't want you running around the streets now. It's dangerous isn't it. For them too. It might be. They weren't safe in their own home so I brought them here for their protection. I wanted to see just how far your cruelty would go. If you would dare harm them here in your own home. Thank heaven you are here and safe. You were worried about me? Yes. If anything happened to me you'd feel badly wouldn't you, father. You love me don't you, like other fathers love their daughters. I am to believe that, am I? Using me as a tool for your wretched System proves it doesn't it. How crazy your enemies are to think that after the misery you cause every day .. That you have any feelings left. They are crazy to think that by hurting me they could hurt you. Gloria. You've robbed me of every happiness I've had in life. But I am not going to let you have Malcolm or Mrs Stanton. The only ones who have been nice to me, the only ones I love. Go on back to your filthy business of making people suffer. Yes, yes. Alright. Plant number 24 just closed. That's the last one. They wanted a fight. They are getting it. A big opposition, eh? We're beating them every step of the way. Hello, Chief. We've got them on the run like a bunch of scared rabbits. There is the last report. Not much fight left in them. Call everything off, Sneed. - What? I said call everything off. What's happened to you to make this decision? Something personal? Sure. The most personal thing in the world. I realize what a mess I've made of things. I'm a great guy. We're a pack of great guys. Scheming and fighting to take milk away from babies. That's grand and noble isn't it. If you want to make speeches you'd better get a soap box. All I know is that we cannot call this thing off now. Listen to me, all of you. Have I ever led you wrong? Have I ever given you a false tip? I've a reason to call this off. I know what I'm doing and you'll do what I say. Maybe we will and maybe we won't. Just because you've had a brainstorm. Can't you be reasonable? You know you can't stop The System. The machine cannot be stopped. Not only can it be stopped, it can be smashed. Well, that is an interesting statement. Explain it. - I'm not explaining anything. I'm ordering you to call off this milk war. We refuse. Now, what are you going to do about it? The rest of you fellows refuse? Like Sneed? Or are you going to do what I say? You're wrong, Bannister. - I think so too. Sneed has the right idea. Well, it looks like mutiny. How are you going to handle it? - Without gloves, my boy. If you fellows are figuring on trouble you are going to get it. By tomorrow morning I'll have the records of this organisation .. In the hands of the United States District Attorney. You wouldn't dare! Is this your idea of a joke? Yeah. It's a great joke. It will mean about 20 years in the Pen for you, about 15 for you. About 10 to life for you. You've been a nice Sunday Schoolboy. You'll get about 5 years. Of course. And nothing would happen to you? They'd probably hang me but I am willing to take a chance. Well, what do you say? Do we call this thing off? Or do we have a nice little party with the Federal Authorities? Alright. You win, Jack. Call off the war. The jails are uncomfortable at this time of the year. Well, it .. You're probably figuring on .. Trying to double-cross me, but I'll manage to keep a step ahead of you. Now Jack, it is downright unkind of you to even suspect that we could .. You hand me many a laugh, Sneed. Well. The armistice is signed. I'll see you later. Why did you give in to him like that? - He's made monkeys out of all of us. You shouldn't let him get away with it. - We ought to take care of him quick. Can't you fellows be a little clever? Don't you see, Bannister has turned yellow. You can argue with a crazy man. But a man who has turned yellow and wants to squeal. Well. We'd better be careful. Clayton. Get hold of Ed Bailey for me. The fellow that used to be in the Produce business. I want to see him right away. Mr Bailey, I understand you were in the Produce business. Yes, sir. Why did you give up your business? I didn't give it up. It was taken away from me. Oh, that's too bad. How did it happen? - It's a long story. I've got lots of time. It took me 20 years to build up my business. I dared him to kill me too but .. He hid behind a slot in the door and I never got a look at him. All I heard was his voice. I'll never forget that. I guess he was afraid to let you see him. He was afraid you might meet him again sometime. If I ever do. I would do the same thing. But that isn't what I want to see you about. You've had a hard time, Bailey. Well, I think we may be able to find something for you. Come around and see me tomorrow morning. That's fine. Thanks. Oh, wait a minute. I wonder if you'd mind doing me a little favor? Deliver this letter for me. It won't take much time. - Certainly. Hello. Get me Bannister on the phone. Yes. He is at home. Do you know Jack Bannister? - No. Ever heard the name before? - No. The address is on the envelope. Be sure and give it to Mr Bannister personally. Certainly. And if you like. Talk to him about giving you a job in one of those produce stores of his. That's fine. Thanks, mister .. Mister ..? - Spring. Goodnight, Mr Spring. I'll see you tomorrow. I hope so. Hello? Yes. Sneed? Jack. We've drawn up an agreement with The Consolidated people. They want you to sign it right away. I'm sending a man to your house with it. Fine. I'll be in all evening. Thanks. Goodbye. Well, you always wanted me to be a banker. Alright, I'll .. I'll get a job at that. Providing Dick doesn't make me try to buy any bonds. Do you wish the coffee served in here? - Yes, please. Mr Bannister. There is a man with a letter. 0h yes, I was expecting it. Tell him to leave it. He was told to give it to you personally, sir. Alright. - Dad. You said you would forget the office forever. I'll just be a minute. I'll be right back. Well, I'll give you two minutes. And then I'll ring you on the house phone .. And you can tell the man you have an important engagement. Alright. Excuse me. Mr Bannister. A letter for you. Is there an answer? Shall I wait? No, I don't think so. You don't have to wait. Mr Spring said I was to get an answer. Mr Spring said you were connected with the Produce business. You might be able to help me get a job. Perhaps you knew of my old firm? Bailey & Son. [ Telephone ] I'm a big banker and I want to see you at once. About that big after dinner coffee deal. Uhuh. If you don't come right away I'm going to bring your coffee into you. Did you hear what I said? [ Door knocks ] [ Door knocks ] Come in. Perhaps you can tell me someone to see? I am sorry to interrupt you but father hasn't had his coffee. He is very fond of it. Would you like some? No, thanks. Here you are, daddy. Sorry. It's alright. It's nothing. It just stung for a moment. I'll get something for it. - No, no. It's nothing really. Go ahead, finish your business. I'll get you another cup. No, don't. - It's no trouble. Talk. Go on. Talk. Go on and say something. You ain't dumb. What do you want me to say, Bailey? That's enough. I just got wise. I guess this guy Spring ain't a friend of yours is he. Well, he is of mine. He is, eh? You are the man with the voice. The big guy. You recognised me and you were afraid to speak. You should have killed me when you had me. When I asked you to. But I let you go instead. - After you killed my son. Don't think that is going to get you off. Alright. Go ahead, Bailey. If you don't get me, somebody else will. Killing is too good for you. You're going to be made to suffer while you are alive. Like I have. Mourning for someone you love. That daughter. [ Door knocks ] Get away from that door. You are going to know what suffering is. Your finger's getting tired on that trigger, Bailey. You'd better pull it. [ Door knocks ] Father, I've brought you some more coffee. Keep away from that door. [ Gunshots! ] Get away, Gloria. Get away! Gloria. Gloria. Father! So they got Bailey? Well, he deserves the chair and he'll get it. Bannister is dead. That's too bad. That's awful. Yeah. Ro_s
