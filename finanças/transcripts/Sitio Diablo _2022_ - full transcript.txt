If you see me spin your deceitful mind. Then you'll know that a real G's lust has no end. I am the fucker on the throne, I delight in scraping the entrails off you rotted parasites. The stench of your whores assault my nostrils. Call me Master. I am the deluge and the storm. Sitio Diablo is my paradise. And you shall all bathe in blood, because that is what Change entails, and I will repeat, again and again, I will keep making a fool of you that I am a messiah and this is my psalm. We're happy living in our homes; We eat together as a family, when suddenly the future comes knocking banging on our lives, tearing a hole in it. Everywhere you look, nothing is going right you say it's progress, but it looks the opposite. If only we could bring back the past. Down on our knees, where is the justice? The harsh wind thrashes down my throat. They pretend they know nothing. That's why they can't think of solutions I hope we can find a way. Because if not, I'll just keep holding on. We are the Illustrados, we're unstoppable. We are the Illustrados, modern warriors. We'll stand up, fight back, Illustrados. We got balls. Someone's coming! Get ready! Hey! Son of a bitch, we're ready for you! Let me at 'em! Dude, easy. We're not looking for trouble. Shithead! We're still waiting for payback! You stabbed my cousin! You attacked us first! Why are you here? We want to join forces with you. We're up against one enemy. The Diablos. We've had disagreements but I hope we can put it aside. We've got beef with them, too. How can we be sure you won't fuck us over? You know me, Macoy. Bullet. Even back when we were in Diablo, I'm a man of my word. You'll leave Tonix to me. He's all yours. Let's go kill some Diablos! Go to Aina's. Bro, I'm ready for this. Bro, I can do this. This still isn't your fight, bro. Get out of here. Macoy! These fucking snakes are out of their nest. Look at you, you big fat ball sack! Fuck you! Shut up! - You fucker! - You son of a bitch! Fuck you! Let's see what you got! Let's go! Bullet! Bro! Aina, get out of there! Get out of the way! Aina, get out of the way! Sitio Diablo is cursed. Beat him up. Its real name is Sitio Santiago. James was one of the first apostles of Jesus. A holy saint. But in this sitio, the saintly diesâ€¦ So even angels turn into demons. Goddamn. Throw him out! The goody-goodies have no place here. No weaklings. The nice ones don't have a chance. In this place, violence thrives. You have to be more evil than the devil. But you can't survive on courage alone; Devils, when they come together, are more terrifying. And if you join these demons, Go ahead. Kill him already! You can forget about getting out of this hell-hole. Kill him! Kid, you're a natural! Way to go! Nice work, kid! There's only one way out of here: Death. Ask your leader if we can campaign here on Calle Trese. Sure, go ahead! You're talking to us, the leaders. Isn't that right, Askal? We can handle the people around here. 300 pesos, just in case? 300 pesos? That makes 3,000 pesos for ten people. That's not all. You'll get free rides on a bus or jeep, and food, too. All I can tell you is "Yes, sir!" "Yes ma'am!" Yes! Just make sure you have a hundred people for me. All right. A hundred people. Easy-peasy, yeah? Askal? - I'll leave it to you. - All right. We're already done, Mayor. - Thank you so much, Mayor. - No, thank you. Hey, how are you guys? Mayor! Mayor have a drink with us! Mayor! Mayor! Mayor, any will do. Thank you, thank you so much! Thank you, thank you so much! You dickhead. Trese's not our territory. It's Aztec's. Not my fault they're birdbrains. Birdbrains? What if the Aztecs find out what you did? What then? Hey. We did that. Don't say we. That's all you. It was your idea. I see how it is. Give me your hand. Now it's on both of us, huh? Come on. Wait, 500? That person gave you 5,000. You're giving me 500? You're giving me chump change? Fine. You're a pain in the butt. Be thankful you're getting any at all. This is great. I have money for school. What's school gonna do for you? Just tag along with me. I'll give you money. I'll teach you how to make money, man. You know what, forget it. I still think it's better if you've gone to school, earn a diploma. You'll get a good... Fuck, man. Diplomas can be forged in Recto. Do what you like. I'm just worried about that the Aztecs will find out what you did. That we cheated them of their profits. Fuck, man. Don't be so nervous. Besides, that homo doesn't know I'm an Illustrado. Chill out. Look how much we scored. Dude, act normal. Don't look suspicious. Askal. Damn it, run! You two. Are you the ones Magdangal's campaign manager talked to? Huh? Who's that? Don't bullshit me. Give me the money. What money? Dude, I don't know what you're talking about. I know those two. They're Illustrado. Fucking Bullet's trying to play me. Search them. Take everything they got. What's this? Fucking hell, Bullet. Keep your pets off my turf. You're in Trese territory! So what? What're you yapping about, dickheads? Give him a taste, Bullet. My hand's been itching to land a punch on his face. You know me, Bullet. We've been pals since Diablo. I don't know how to tell a lie. Hey, hey, hey. Bullet. They're bullshitting you. We didn't do nothing, man. Ask Askal. Right, Askal? So, Bullet? Make a decision. Fuck you, Pons. I'll let this slide this time. But next time, I will break your face. Okay. Keep your boys in line, too. I'm gonna kill that asshole. Shithead. The hell, man. That's for dragging Askal in your shit. That fucking hurts. - Ouch! - One more till you get it. That's for making trouble for the group. You're gonna snap my neck. This. This will punch a hole in your skull for sure. There you go. Hey, Andi. That's enough. We should grind down his horns. Are you deaf? I said that's enough. He doesn't learn his lesson 'cause you keep coddling him. Want my fist to coddle you? Spank me, mommy! That's enough. There you go again, siding with your girlfriend. Hey, Andi. Stop it. Did you learn anything? Pulling that stupid shit. I just want to tell you that not everything's about money. Yes, sir. Because of what happened, we got into trouble with the Aztecs. You know Pons and I had a deal, right? That we stay out of each other's territory. But what did you do? You dumb-ass. You let your greed get the better of you. And you dragged our group into it. I don't think so. You know how Pons works. Especially those of you who've been here longer. He's an asshole. But that asshole sticks to his word. But because of what happened, he can forget all about our deal. Fuck, man. He's gonna prepare for war. So each one of you... is already marked. He can you take you out. Let's strike first, then. Andi, you sound like a fucking newbie. We'd just be giving them more reason to fight. Where'd our balls go, then? Down Pons' throat? I thought you were bad asses. Andi, stop poking the fire. Benny, say something to your fucking brother. One more word out of line and I'll break his face. You know what's the fucking problem with you? You don't use your brains. It's always your balls talking. Remember: We started this. We're the ones who didn't keep our end of the deal. We are in the wrong. So don't worry. Let me fix this. I will talk to Pons. But as long as I haven't talked to him, as long as this isn't ironed out, you have to be careful. Avoid Trese. No one walks alone. If necessary... stay in groups. Is that clear? - Is that clear? - Yeah. You think Pons will back down? I'll talk to him. We had some good times together. I guess. He owes you a debt of gratitude. He should be. Remember when he was almost killed by the PKP? But you got to him first. What's on your mind? The group. I'm wondering if they think I'm getting weaker. I doubt that. What you did was right. The mess will only grow out of hand if we stick our asses to it. We're not in Diablos anymore. Do you regret leaving that place? The reason why I joined is only because of you. Go buy! You fucker! Hey! Marites! - What do you want? - Fuck you! Hey! What's your problem? - What? - Huh? What rumors are you spewing about Basyo? You fucking bitch, I'll chop up your tongue! - You old bitch. - What jumper are you talking about? - It's true, though, isn't it? - Hey! You ugly son of a bitch! I'm going to electrocute you fucking bitch. - Ma'am, that's enough. - Let me go! Fuck you! That shameless fucking bitch. - You'll drop dead, too! - Fuck you! - Fuck you! - Fuck you! You whores! I'm gonna put your tongues through a grinder! - Pigs! Good-for-nothing! - Thanks, bro. Just stay in your houses and shut the fuck up! - Give me that. - Shit. I'll scrape your fucking tongues. I'm gonna scratch their tongues till they bleed. Ma. People here have lost respect for me. Ma, have some water. She was going around telling everyone... I'm sleeping with Basyo! That horrid fucking butt-ugly shrimp. Tonix is here. They'll start to think twice, those motherfuckers. About speaking ill of me. When Tonix became supreme leader of Diablos, he also entered into illegal activities. Theft, robbery at gunpoint, peddling illegal drugs, too. - He's just here to buy. - My bad, I didn't know. - How much are we splitting? - Only this. Tonix, should I do it? They became guns for hire, too. Good thing he wasn't killed by the police. But because of it, Tonix has been rotting in City Hall for two years. Mother says Tonix is doing well. He's protected by older Diablo members who became inmates before him. And you. What have you given me? Huh? Shame and misfortune. Then you who red yourself out to Bullet. Ma. Bullet is my boyfriend. What? Boyfriend? So when he left Diablo, you followed him, huh? You know what that makes you? A traitor! Let me just remind you, Aina. Your father is the founder of Sitio Diablo. This place was built with his blood. And that blood runs through your veins. I don't know why I keep expecting anything from you in Diablo. You're a girl. You're of no use to the group. At least High-C checks on me from time to time. Fuck, what about you? Nothing. I can't expect anything from you. You know what, just leave me alone. I'll be cranky all day looking at you. Leave me. Get out of my face. Go on. Go away. What are you standing around for? Go away! Or I'll throw this at you! Go ahead! This little bitch. How dare you. Go away! Go be with Bullet! You fucking bitch. You're pissing me off! Well, fuck's your problem? Get out of here! I can't stand you. I can't get any comfort from you. Fuck. Now you're pissing me off. - Ma! - Yeah? How's it going? Bless. This is Kira, by the way. What happened to you, Ma? Those stupid neighbors are driving me crazy! - It's because Tonix's still in jail. - Shit, that's right. When he gets back, we're gonna cut off all their power. What the fuck? Where are you taking me? Fuck, is this where you'll kill me? Tonix. Long time no see. You can always visit me in jail, sir. Tonix, man. You know this meeting's secret. So, you wanna get out yet? Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill you here. I still got use for you. Uncuff him. Kid. If you want to get out, we can make that happen. I'll arrange for your release papers, Tonix. - Get his release papers ready. - Yes, boss. What's the catch? Slow down, Tonix. That's what we've come here for. You understand? That old fart Magdangal, he's loaded, huh? When he wins, his stash is just gonna grow for sure. He might even double his income. We don't know that. Let's give him a chance. Stop talking about politics. You're just kids. What the hell do you know? - Kids? Can't kids join the conversation? - Right. Let Macoy be. He doesn't believe in the government anymore. Well, it's true. Doesn't matter who you put up there. Not a damn thing's going to change for us. He's got a point. We'll still be fighting over a piece of bread to survive. And that shit about twenty-peso rice? Fuck that. Watch it. Watch it or you'll piss off each other. I remember that old couple Marta and Berto. You know them. They quarreled because they're voting for different presidents. I saw them chasing each other with a machete. - For real? - You brown-noser! Hey, shit, did you hear about what happened to Jepoy? One of the Aztecs. What happened? He got stabbed last night. He's dead. You fuckers. Own up. Whose work was that? Huh? Psst. Andi. Hey. Fuck, man, don't look at me. I don't know anything about that! Watch your mouth, asshole. That's my girlfriend you're swearing at. I'm fucking telling you. I had nothing to do with that. I was at Benny's last night. Right, bro? See. Fuck. Pons is going to pin that on us. He'll get back at us. We should watch our backs. What the fuck? Why should we? Let's just strike first. Strike first? We don't have a plan. If we're going to hit them, we can't do it willy-nilly. You are my priority. Together we will change the course of our fates! Let's hold each other's arms. We will lift ourselves up! We shall keep the road open to City Hall! So friends, I'm asking you, in the coming election, don't forget, the third name on your ballots: Magdangall for Mayor! I heard you're running this place. Don't worry. This is our territory. We'll take care of it. Whatever I promised tonight, We will make it happen. In less than a hundred days, it will happen! You'll have food on your table. Because every one of you will have decent jobs! Can I get a round of applause? Been keeping this a secret for a while. Who's my idol? It's Artemio Magdangall! So if you want a thick wad of cash every month vote for the mayor who knows how to love! Comin' in hot. You can die, we all have problems, don't get carried away. It's not all bad luck at hand. Death is in a car, don't get in it. It's heavy, it's not obvious. Why even though it's clear, it seems like no one can? You are hiding and crying on your hands. Tell me your problem. How bad? Your shoes are the problem, those others have no feet but fight life with almost no trepidation. You are not weak, I want you to fight more. Stand there and wipe your eyes. If you don't know who to turn to, even with a blade you can't hold on to anything, no matter how deep the misfortunes, there is always God, you can pray on. Yeah! Shout out to Mayor Magdangall! Yeah! Suddenly, all the world slowed down. When you showed up out of the blue. As I turned at the corner. We met at an unexpected time. And we spoke in that fated moment. Like a star, is this real or is it a dream? I wish I could ask you before I wake up. Young miss. Will you be my baby? Will you be my lady? If you want to reach for the stars Reach for the stars, we'll fly to heaven. And touch them together. Let the fun begin! Fuck! The Aztecs are here! Pons! Son of a bitch! We had a deal. No stealing into each other's territory. No going behind each other's back! What the fuck are you on about? Jepoy! He was killed by one of yours, wasn't he? Motherfucker. Fuck you! I didn't betray you, asshole! I dare you! You challenge me one more time, motherfucker, and I'll slash your fucking head off. Askal! Askal! What happened? - Help! - Askal's been hit! You bitch. Askal, you can do this. - Askal, you need to bear it. - I don't want to die. You're not gonna die, stupid. Hang on, dude. You're gonna be fine. You're tough shit, right? You can do this. Askal. Does it hurt? You can do it, man. Just hold on. You can do it. You can do it, Askal. Go on, scream it out. Just a little bit more. It's almost over. Hang on a little bit. You can do it, man. It's just an ant's bite. But the ant's this big. Bullet. We still need to bring him to the hospital. Hold on. You dipshit. The kid almost died because of what you did. That's on them. I just got back at them for starting that fight, that's why I took out Jepoy. You fuckhead. You just made it all worse. What's wrong with a little thrill, right? This group is boring me out of my mind. You should have thought about the group. I already have a wife. I've got two kids. I'm getting sick of looking after you, Andi. I'm gonna have to tell Bullet about this. Hey. Don't tell Bullet. He might sacrifice me to Pons. Besides, we play a big part in the group. We're valuable to them. You should go. You might wake the kids. Get out. Hurry up. Take it easy, man. I'll bring him inside, grandma. Could I have a word with you both? Sure, grandma. What is it? Could you leave Askal out of your gang? Grandma, that decision is up to Askal. Whether or not he wants to leave... No! What does Askal know about all this fighting? My grandson is only 17 years old. I know you both grew up here in the sitio. You're well aware of the violence that thrives in this place. But I have dreams for my grandson. I don't want him to end up like his father who just died from fist-fights with degenerates. Askal's got smarts. He's an honor student. I can't let him waste his chances by tagging along with you! Don't worry, grandma. - We've got Askal under our protection. - What? My grandson got stabbed. What protection are you talking about? Askal is all I have. I won't lose him to the barbarity of this place. Do you understand? All right, grandma. We'll speak to Askal. He'll also be the one to decide if he'll leave or stay. I'm losing faith in Bullet. His balls are getting soft. Influenced by his girlfriend! What makes you say that? If I were him, I'd have finished Pons when I had him by the neck. The trouble would have been dealt with! The Aztecs would declare war if Bullet had killed Pons. There you go again, Benny. You're taking the side of your leader again. And you're such a fan so you're defending him. That's why you can't see his faults. Bullet's just trying to protect us. In the event of a clash, we're at a disadvantage. For starters, there's more of them. More people, more weapons. There's more of them, sure. But who's stronger? - Damn right. - Right? Besides, Bullet's getting on my last nerve. It's probably better if I break away from the group. I'll just put up my own. Hey. Hey, don't do that, bro. You can't leave us behind! Yeah right. If you're leaving, then do it for real. Get away from this thug life altogether instead of making your own group. What, you're gonna go against us, too? Whoa. One of the Diablos lost his way. I don't have anything on me. Why are you here? Where's Aina? Why? Tonix got out. Tonix. How's it going? Son of a bitch. - Damn, I missed you. - Tonix. Tonix, ever since you got jailed, some of our members broke away. Some of them made their own factions. I tried to stop them. But all they care about is money. Let them be. Let's leave that for later. I missed you guys. Here. Still hot. My backâ€¦ You have to forgive me, son. I couldn't visit you in the city jail. I'll make it up to you, all right? I'll cook your favorite food. Go on. Eat up. Hi-C told me the neighbors are giving you a hard time while I was in jail. Yeah, itchy-tongued neighbors and their fucking lies. They keep spreading all sorts of gossip. Don't worry, Ma. We'll cut off their tongues. Make an example of them. Now that I'm here, nobody's going to mess with you. You'll be an empress. Really, son? Dig in. Help yourself. Eat well. Eat up, son. Eat up. - Well. - Bro. Look what the cat dragged in. When did you get out? Just the other day. Come on, let's eat. It's okay, bro. I already ate. We don't have any more plates. Pick off the fish bones for Tonix. Come back to Diablo. You and Bullet. Bring in the whole gang. I'll take care of you. I heard about your clash with Pons' gang. I can protect you. Just come back to Diablo. Bro, that's not my decision anymore. It's Bullet's call. You trust that guy? We're family. We should be comrades. What are you pissed about? Eat first. Relax. You're always causing problems... Yummy. Do you think I've gotten weaker? You bet. Back then, you wouldn't think twice about knocking down your opponent. I thought you said you'll snatch Tonix' throne from him? That's why I followed you. Now you're acting all soft on us. Where'd your swag go? You're losing your cool vibe. Are you gonna let that happen? Don't let that happen. You can't. What do you want me to do? Of course, you gotta show this place that you're king. That nobody fucks with you. Protect your reputation. Have you met with Tonix? My brother wants us to go back to Diablo. So he'll back us up against Aztec. No. We're not going back to Diablo. What about the Aztecs? Those milk-drinking punks. We can take 'em. Holy shit! Exciting! My pal's got a hard-on. But our war with the Aztecs will not be taking place. Pons turned down Tonix' offer to go back to Diablo. Tonix didn't like that. Fuck, this is it! We should go! And to make an example of them, the Diablos raided Aztec's territory. Join the Diablos. Please don't hurt me! That so? Hit him hard, Tonix! Kill him! Where'd you pick up these suckers? They look like they're Shin's internet shop rats. They're just a bunch of squirts. How old are you? The Supremo just asked you a question. - Answer him! - Fifteen, sir. This one thinks he can speak in English! They won't even pass as snatchers! It's all cool, Tonix. Fresh blood. That's twenty thousand worth. You fucker. Don't even think about cheating me. Fuck if I dare, man. Tonix is here. Tell Kiko. Heaven or hell? Heaven, ma'am! Me, too. I choose heaven. How much did we get today? Fifty. This should do. We're break even. Chief: I still have three kilograms. I'll leave it to you. Take your shirt off. Drink it! Bottoms up! Bite it! Was the change good for Diablo? No, sir! Was the change good for Diablo? Answer me! Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Yes, sir! I congratulate you. What do you want? Just come out and say it. That's what we want. Eat up. Their Deep-fried Pork Belly is really good. Remember when we were kids? Papa used to bring us here all the time. Especially when he scored a lot of cash. I know it's your favorite. Go ahead. You still have that. Papa gave you that because you're a girl. For your protection. But are you feeding it? That amulet needs to be prayed over to be any good. We're not going back to Diablo. I'm talking to my sister, you fuck. Don't be a dick. Can you calm down, both of you? You're on the top of our list. Because I know you'll refuse my offer. I don't want to drag my sister into this. She's family. Papa left her in my care. That's why I went after Pon's group first. It might help you change your mind. I've made up my mind. You've made up your mind? Yes. That's my decision. Are you deaf? Why are you doing this, big bro? Why did you call us here? I won't force you to come back into the fold. If you wanna run your own joint, fine. But I want you to be my business partners. Partners? You have a business? I have a backer. He's the one who got me out of jail. But I need to work for him. What's that? You're someone's bitch now, too? Bullet. You want to control the whole sitio. I supply the whole place. Meth. That's why you attacked Pons. They're my competition both in territory... and in business. Bro, why us? Aina, I trust you. We're one blood. Diablo. And Bullet? Of course, he's my favorite. - I know him inside out. - Then what? You get what I get. 50-50. And if we refuse? I'm doing everything I can to avoid a clash. I'm sharing my kingdom with you. Why are you acting all tough shit? - Bro, just leave us out... - Don't call me bro. Watch it, motherfucker! Bullet. Think carefully, Bullet. Because next time, I won't give a shit about family. Aina. Bullet. Bullet, wait. Your brother's a son of a bitch. I'll finish that fucking monster. Bullet, we need to discuss this with the group. You're considering his offer? Bullet, he's my family. Family? He treats you like a doormat. We're free from Diablo. We're free from your family. We don't need to feed off of their palms, anymore. Those days are over. I'm done being your brother's lackey. I'm done with all his shit. You can't force me to go back. Bullet. I'm not asking you to go back. I just think it should be the whole group's decision. Whatever we agree on, I'll honor that. Bullet, you're the only family I have left. What took you so fucking long! Had to talk to someone. There should be two million in here. Why are you missing 500? We haven't picked up the cash from Trese. You said you're all good. That group is a little tough to crack. You know what, Tonix? I don't want to hear how much bigger of an asshole than you that motherfucker is. A deal is a deal. - You understand? - Yes. Yes! Sell all of that. Remember. You'd better complete your payments by Sunday. Sure, boss. The Diablos are offering an alliance. But I'm going to kill the Diablos. Now, I understand... if you can't fight. But I'm asking you don't even plan on turning your backs against us. Because I'll fight you head to head. Bullet, we're not gonna fucking do that to you. You know that. We're one. Fight! We're gonna kill those fuckers! This one's got good quality! - I'll take care of this son. - I hope this doesn't stop. You bet. There's more... here, here. Here. Here's for you. Give that to Eleven. They know what to do. Come right back, you hear? These are good stuff, son. - I hope we sell a lot today, Ma. - Yeah. Leave it to me. You heard from Aina yet? Are you having second thoughts? I'm thinking about Aina. She's still one of ours, Ma. You're my only family. Aina's no child of mine. She's from a fuck-who-knows whore your father knocked up. Tonix. You can't doubt yourself. If you do that, they'll second guess your words. Words are a king's power. If you soften up and give way to Aina, your word will lose its potency. And you might lose your throne. Ma's right. You need to enforce the rules. Family or not. Don't get involved in this trouble. Tsk, sis. We're Illustrado. We're up in arms. We'll die as Illustrados. You can't. I don't want to bury my Illustrado brothers. Especially not the two of you. Choose your future. And you Askal. Your grandma told me you have a scholarship. Keep that. If you can, you should leave this place. Don't wait for the fight to break out. Pfft. The hell, sis? It's like you don't even know us. We can take them on. We're bad asses. You can ask Askal. I even gutted one of the Aztecs just the other day. I let the fucker bleed out right here. - He's dead, dude. Dead as fuck. - I don't remember anything like that. That's enough. It's better if you left this place. How are we gonna do that? We don't have a life outside the sitio. If I leave, I'll just go back to being a homeless bum. If I'll die anyway, I'd rather do it fighting with you. Garong's right, sis. Everyone who's from here are destined to die here. Nobody gets out of this place alive. Faster Toks! Son of a bitch! We'll have our revenge on him! Toks, hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! - You motherfucker! - Hurry, get him inside! You motherfucker! Hurry up, man! - Fuck! - You think you can get away? You motherfucker. Stop moving! Let me go! Let me go! Shut your fucking mouth! I didn't do anything! You son of a bitch! You talk too fucking much! You fucking loudmouth! Thanks. Let's have a taste. Yum. You're a good cook. Hey. You okay? Are you pregnant? My period's two-month's late. Bullet. It's Garong. Bullet. I found this on the other side of the bank. To defeat the Diablos, you need to be more cunning than they are. Let me go! Hey! What the fuck! First, we needed to get on Tonix nerves. So we went after his business first. We bullied and intimidated his little henchmen. We knew the Diablos would come after us. So we came up with a plan. Fuck. Nobody's here. They got us again. We needed to keep moving spots to confuse them about our location. That way, they won't know when and where we'll strike. We could have gotten back at them. Shit. Bullet named the group Illustrado because he believes that it will bring the light into this nest of demons. Fuck you! I'll break your fucking skull! This light will illuminate everything and open our eyes. Huh? And this loose chin of yours? I'll make it into sour soup! I'll have your buddies chew on it, even your aunts, and your... Fuck you! You're driving me nuts! Fuck y'all. I don't care if you gang up on me. The fuck did you say? - I don't care if you gang up on me! - Fuck you! Fuck you! This one's for Garong. Fuck you! You son of a bitch. You should be gutted. It's easy to kill the Diablos. This one's for Garong. Dump him in the river. Blankets, sis. If you need anything, just holler. - Thanks. - Thanks. Is there a problem? I'm just thinking about you. And about our... About our child. What if you get away for a while? Bring Grandma Edna with you and Askal. If I'm leaving, it'll be with you. But that's impossible. I can't leave Macoy and the others in this battle. Don't worry. Nothing bad's going to happen to me. You're just saying that to calm me down. Aina. I love you very much. And I can't possibly sacrifice you and our child. For what? Just for this stupid war? So please... listen to me. My father told me that this came from his grandfather who was a soldier. Did you know that St. James is the patron saint of soldiers in Spain? He watches over all the soldiers in a war. In that case, I won't die. This is the only connection I have left with my family. With my father's love for me. This medallion has kept me safe all these years. You just have to trust it, too. Are you guys doing all right? Where were you? Just went out for some fresh air. You're a father now, Benny. You can't still be joining gang wars like a clueless teenager. Mona. This'll be the last. I just need to look after Andi. How old do you think your brother is, Benny? He's old enough. Why don't you worry about your own kids for a change? Besides, your brother's a maniac. Right, he's a little crazed. That's why I've got to keep an eye on him. Mona. Mama asked me to take care of him. I don't want to break my promise to them. I hope you get that. I'm Andi's only family. This is the last time. I've had enough. Bullet. These are the boys who want to fight the Diablos with us. I don't think these punks are ready to fight to the death. Allies don't grow on trees, Bullet. The fuck is this? You bring me milk drinkers? They're too green. Okay, you know what to do. Pull down your shorts! Yeah? Then I'll kneel. Then you jump into the water. Did you think I'd put those in my mouth? I will promote programs that will promote a bright future for our youth. Programs that will keep them away from drugs and violence. You drug addicts prowling our streetsâ€¦ Drugs addicts, wherever rat hole you're hiding out on the streets or in your houses... I will not be selective. I will come find you. The entire police force is behind this program to eradicate and dismantle you. The addicts of this sitio under the administration of Mayor Magdangall. Go to Aina's. Bro, I'm ready for this. Bro, I can do this. This still isn't your fight, bro. Get out of here. Macoy! I know it's not easy for you to leave this place. Your brother and your boyfriend are out to kill each other. But I'm telling you, whomever of them wins, nothing will change in the sitio. As long as the politicians don't take us seriously, and see us only as numbers in their ballots, people will remain poor. And because of that poverty, crime and violence will keep thriving. You're making the right decision. No child should be born in this cursed place. Askal, take care of your grandma. I won't leave you here, sis. Who told you we'll pass through here? Huh? Macoy did! Give me back Aina. And I'll let you back into Diablo. Just don't hurt her. She's my sister. Why would I hurt her? Askal. Take care of your grandma. Got it? - Get out of here! - Aina! Let's go, Grandma. I've been waiting for you. These fucking snakes are out of their nest. - Look at you, you big fat ball sack! - Fuck you! Shut up! - You fucker! - You son of a bitch! You're really asking for it! Bullet! Bro! Here comes! Get ready! Hey! You're not supposed to be here, Aina! Fuck you! You snake! - I only did it because... - Because you're a coward! Because I want to save you. I love you, Aina. You betrayed us. Traitor! Sons of bitches! Bro! Fuck you! Fuck you! Bro! I'm sorry, Ma. Hey. Hey. Fight it, bro. Bro! Bro! You motherfucker. Bro! You little bitch! Hey. What is it? Sir, there's a street fight over there. Holy fuck, you sure made the wrong fucking choice. I gave you a chance but you blew it. You should have just left us alone. Fuck you. You son of a bitch. Andi's blood is on you. Fuck you. Show me what you got! You're weak! Asshole! Huh? Motherfucker! What? Huh? Fuck you! Fuck you! Bullet! What a fucking mess. Clean that up. Goddamn it, Tonix. You're a fucking idiot. Clean it all up. All right, shooting's over. You can go back to your rat holes! Bullet. Fuck you! Bullet. Get away from here. No, Bullet. I can still heal you. There's nothing more we can do. There's nothing more we can do. It's over. You should leave. Don't even come back here. If our children grow up someplace else, they won't end up like us. They'll be free. Fuck, you should go now. You should fucking go. I love you so much. I love you so much. Sorry. You don't belong here. Get away. Fuck... Leave! Fucking leave. Leave me. Bulletâ€¦ Leave. Leave right now. One day, I'll make my own group. And I'll make you queen. I'd rather not be queen if I'm to reign in this place. I don't want to be the queen of this shithole. Where do you want to be queen? Somewhere far. Where our children won't become drug-addicts, thievesâ€¦ Our kids will play in a clean ocean. Or run around in this sitio. A new sitio. A new world. No rich people, no poor peopleâ€¦ Everybody's equal. So, how's the mess? Have you cleaned up Sitio Diablo? Those Diablos were pests. Their enemy gangs, too. They've disrupted our operations. Well, mayor, that's why we wiped them all out. So we can start from the beginning. I left one gang to roam. They shouldn't be too much trouble. How much do you need?
