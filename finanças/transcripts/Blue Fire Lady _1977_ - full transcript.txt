Oh, it's nothing to do with you. It's just that he hates horses. - If only he could see you ride, he'd change his mind. - No chance. He won't even let me near a horse. - Surely he must realize you've got talent, and if you trained hard, you could take on the world's best. - I only wish I had it in me. - You know how much I love working with show horses, but Dad won't even have a horse on the place. When he found out I was coming here to ride for you, he was furious. I've tried to speak to him, but he just won't listen. - You must understand your father's point of view. - I know how Dad feels, but he won't talk to me about it. Anyway, if we hadn't come to Australia, I never would have met the famous Bartletts. (all chuckling) I must go. Dad'll come looking for me. See ya. - Bye. - Bye. - Oh, morning, Dad. You're up early. - Where have you been? - I went to see the Bartletts. - I thought I told you to keep away from there. - I'm sorry, but Diamond gave birth to her foal. We've all waited so long, I-- - I don't care why you went. The fact is you deliberately disobeyed me. - But they're my friends. They're nice people. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing, Dad. You won't let me visit the Bartletts because they let me ride their horses, but can't you see I love working with horses, and I'm good at it. - I don't care how good you are. You will keep away from the Bartletts and their horses. Is that clear? - I know why you hate horses, Dad, but what happened to Mum was an accident. It could just as easily-- - I told you never to mention that. - Mum was killed on her horse by a fool in a car, so why blame horses? (sentimental instrumental music) - I've warned you before about defying me. If you go near the Bartletts again, I'll send you to boarding school in Melbourne. Now get on with your work. - Yes, Dad. (music accelerating) (hooves clomping) - The mare's down and Mum needs your help. Dad and I are looking for the vet. (dog barking) - [Alan] What was that Bartlett kid doing here? - Diamond's sick; I've got to go give Mrs. Bartlett a hand. - You're not going. - I haven't got time to argue, Dad. I promised Steve I'd help with the mare and foal. - Jenny! (Diamond whickering) - If anything happens to the old girl... - Don't worry, they'll find him. (dog barking) - [Jack] Easy, girl, easy. - How is she, Jack? - She should be alright, now. I've given her a shot. Temperatures dropping already. (relieved sighs) - Well. - Inside and pack your things, young lady. I phoned the boarding school. They can take you today. I gave you fair warning. (military marching drum music) (rhythmic piano music) (music softens) (military marching drum music) (upbeat piano music) (girls shouting happily) - Hello. - I got your letter. You sounded unhappy. - I am, terribly. - Is it your studies? - No. I have a few problems with maths. - (chuckles) Doesn't everybody? - I have to talk to you about next year. I don't want to go straight to university. I want to get a job and work for a while. - Degrees take a long time to get, Jenny. The sooner you start, the better. - I know, but my exams will be over next week, and I'll be 18, old enough to legally make my own decisions. Try and understand. - I gather this job will give you time for horses. - I hope so. It's what I want. (jazzy instrumental music) Thank you. - Enjoy the stay. - Can I have a room, please? - Certainly. How long? - Only one night, I think. - Fine, fill in the form. (traffic rumbling) (office personnel chatting) (phones ringing) (kitchen personnel chattering in foreign language) - Excuse me, are you Mr. Curtis? - [Curtis] Yes, that's me. - I'm the new groom, Jenny Grey. - You're what? I mean, you're a girl. I couldn't possibly. I mean, there's no way. - But your letter said I had the job. - Yet your letter didn't say you were a girl. (train rumbling) - The advertisement said stud groom required, experienced with horses and cattle. There was no mention of not being female. - But I thought... Look, there's no way my missus, another woman in the place. I'm sorry, girly. I need a man. After all, it's a man's job. Look, here's $20 for your fare and another 20 for your trouble. I'm sorry. (tender guitar music) (hooves clopping) (tender guitar music) (hooves clopping) (upbeat instrumental music) - Excuse me, can you tell me where Mr. McIntyre, the trainer is? - Yes, he's over at the rail. - Thank you. Mr. McIntyre? - That's me. - I've come about the job as a stable hand. The ad did say male or female. - That's right. Can you ride? - Well, yes, since I was a child, and I have helped school show horses. - What about racehorses, ever work them? - No, but I'd like to. They all look so well cared for. - Takes are darn lot of hard work to keep them like that. Come on, we'll see if you can sit on a horse. Charlie! - Yes, Boss? - [McIntyre] Bring out Black Star. - [Charlie] Okay, Mr. McIntyre. - Now, see that sand track? I want you to trot the horse around there once, and cant him around at half pace, once. Betty, give this girl your skullcap. - Here, put this on, regulations. - [Groom] Charlie, can't you see? - There he is. Walk him around first to make sure you can handle him. Okay, jump on. (tense instrumental music) - She'll be lucky if she gets that thing on a track. - You'd like that, wouldn't you? Way she's handling him, I'd say this kid really knows how to handle horses. - Nah, I've seen these riding school chicks before. They're alright on a quiet horse, but give them a cranky one, they go to pieces. - We'll see. - We'll see, alright. (bucket clangs) (horse whinnying) (Charlie laughing) - Charlie, you idiot. (mellow instrumental music) What the hell's going on? Get up and get those stalls finished. - Right, Boss. - And come on, the rest of you get moving. You're not at a rodeo. - Watch him when you first go onto the track, Miss. He's a bit toey, then. After that, just kid to him and he'll be alright. (tender instrumental music) I'm Gus. - I'm Jenny, Jenny Grey. - The boss wants a word. Oh, and well done. - Thanks. - You'll do. A month's trial, okay? Award rates, find your own accommodation. Start Monday, my stables. Address is in the ad. 4:30 a.m. (horse racing playing on radio) (baby crying) - Yeah? - [Jenny] I was just looking for a room. - We've always got rooms. Come in. (doorbell grinding) (muted male yelling) - Hi. - You have a room to let? - [Friend] Who is it, Ralphie? - Chick. Yeah, come on in, lend a hand, the rent's on us. - I think I have the wrong address. Thank you. (Italian string music) - [Mrs. G.] Yes? - Mrs, uh-- - So, you want a room. Okay. Why you no live with your mama and papa, a young girl like you? - I am 18. - You look a nice girl. Okay. Come in, we talk. What's your name? - Jenny, Jenny Grey. - What's your job? - I'm a stable hand with a racehorse trainer. - Oh? The stable? Oh, that's no good job for a girl. Horses. When he was here, my husband, Francesco, he loved horses, too. He'd drive a taxi, all day, all night. He make a lot of money. We save for trip home. What happened? You want to know what happened? I tell you what happened. One day, a customer give him a good tip for a horse. He take the money, he put it on the horse. I tell you what happened. Goodbye, horse, goodbye, money, goodbye, Francesco. Horses, no good. - But it's not the horses' fault when people lose their money. Some people enjoy betting. - That's true. Francesco, he bet on anything. He's stupid, though. Okay. You can stay. - Thanks. - You want breakfast in the morning? - Well, I have to start at half-past four. - Half-past four? In the morning? That's nearly midnight. You cook for yourself, alright? - Fine. Thank you, Mrs... - Hey, everybody, they call me Mrs. G. When you come home from work, I cook you a good, big Italian pasta. Hey, Barry, you're home early for once. - G'day. - [Mrs. G] I want you meet Miss Jenny Grey. She gonna stay with us. - Are you? Great. - [Jenny] Hello. - One day, Barry gonna be bigshot. - Ah, I'm studying engineering. How 'bout you? - Oh, I just left school and I decided to take a job for a while. - [Barry] You're English, aren't you? - Yes. - [Barry] Your folks here? - My father has a farm near Lysterfield. - Ah, beautiful country up there. Beautiful people, too. - Hey, you get out, you cheeky boy. You leave Miss Jenny alone. What she think of my house, you making goo-goo eyes so quick? Now, you go and get clean and then we eat. - Okay, okay, I'm sorry. Let me know if you need any help moving in. - I was gonna hire a taxi truck. - Ah, cost you a fortune. I got an old Morris. I'll lend you a hand. Tomorrow afternoon? - Are you sure? - About four. - Barry work very hard in the garage, pay for school. He really nice boy. You very pretty girl. Plenty nice boys make goo-goo eyes at you. Come on, I show you your room. Goo-goo eyes. - 'Kay, give her a pump. (engine revs) (engine stalls) 'Kay, go again. (engine revving) What's your new job? - Working at a racing stables at Caulfield. - Really? I thought all stable hands were skinny little blokes who talked through their noses. - No, not nowadays. Plenty of skinny little girls work in stables, too. - Why that job? - I want to take up show jumping seriously, and this way I can get some practice and be paid for it. - Any good at this horse thing? - Oh, I think so, but I have to find out for sure. - And your father won't change his mind? - No chance. - Whew, that's the lot. And now, young lady, my account. It's gonna cost you (mimics mumbling addition), one cup of coffee. - It's a deal. - So you wanna be a vet? - No, I just wanted to be able to help on the farm. - And now? - I don't know. - If I can help. - Hey, okay you cheeky boy. That's enough. No more, not in my house. (clock ticking) (alarm ringing) (rapid instrumental music) (McIntyre sighs) - Alright, these two horses are yours: Red Sun and Big Sky. Now I want you to look after these horses properly. They owner of these horses pay a lot of money to have them trained and they expect them to look as though they're getting their money's worth. You take orders from me, and when I'm not here, Charlie's foreman. Hey, Charlie? - [Charlie] Yes, Boss? - Show this girl where everything is, what gear she can use, then get the first line into the float and out the track. Hey, Gus, for crying out loud, get that gear on the two-year-old and let's get moving. Be lunch time if we don't hurry up. - Come on, Charlie Martin, the foreman. Get away, useless old beggar. - I'm Jenny Grey. - You're another one of these riding school champs who think they know everything about horses. - No, I-- - Well, we'll soon find out how much you don't know. You can use that skullcap. Belonged to the last riding school chick we had here. Only lasted a week. One of the colts gave her a fright so she ran home to mummy. - Which is my gear? - Use that saddle. The bridles got their names on 'em. Those two horses you've been given to look after are real scrubbers. Big Sky's got some chance of running last. The other one's gonna break down for sure. You know, owners are very generous with their money if their horses win. If you've got good horses to look after, you make a lot of extra dough. Now, if you and me were friends, I could make sure you got good horses to look after. - No, thank you. - Listen, stuck up-- - [McIntyre] Charlie, get those darn horses in the float. - Coming, Boss. You'll learn. (rapid instrumental music) - [Groom] Take him out easy. - Take him easy. (music increasing) - I suppose that creep Charlie's been giving you the look after me and I'll look after you routine. None of us like him much, especially the way he crawls to Mr. Mac. He took the foreman's job from Gus, you know. - I like Gus. He seems nice. - Mr. Mac says he's too soft on horses. - Okay, okay, cut the cackle. This isn't a royal show. Now get those horses finished. - Steady, I know it's sore. I'll see what I can do. Hello. - Good day, Bobby. He used to guard the stables for Mr. Mac's father. He's a bit deaf now. Charlie wants to get rid of him. Says he upsets the horses. (chuckles) This old dog's forgotten more about horses than Charlie will ever know. - [Jenny] Red Sun's got a lot of heat in his leg. - Tell the boss, not me. I'll tell him that horse'll break down unless he's rested and treated properly. - Well, why hasn't he done anything about it? - Ask him. (Mac sighs) - Yes? - Mr. McIntyre? - [McIntyre] Yes? - Red Sun's got a lot of heat in his leg. - Yeah, I know. - [Jenny] Shall I put a poultice on it? - No, just keep working him. - When I exercised him this morning, he felt very lame. Maybe we should phone the vet. - I said just keep working him. - [Jenny] What if he breaks down? - Listen, girl, if that three-legged crop breaks down, then too bad. I haven't got time to nurse unsound horses. Lame horses can't win races. If a horse can't stand training, then it's no good to me or its owner. Now do as I say and keep working him. - Yes, sir. - Get out of the way, you useless old mutt. - How'd you go? - He said-- - Don't tell me, I know: keep working him. If he breaks down, too bad. That's the way it is in the game these days. Horses like Red Sun who can't pay their way are no good to anyone. - But horses are just as sensitive as people. - You and I know that, but try telling the likes of Charlie. A stable's gotta be run like a factory, and that's that. You can't beat the system. I better get on with it. I'll see you. - [Mrs. G] Here we go. - System. I better get on with it. I'll see you. - [Mrs. G.] Here we go. - [Barry] You sound really fed up with this racing business. - It's different to the showing, Barry. There, the horse and rider form a team. At McIntyre's, it's just big business, and they all accept that. - Hey, what you need is a night out. When's your day off? - Sunday, so I can go out Saturday night. - Great. You and I are gonna have a night on the town. - Hey, what's with this big night out? You tell me. - Oh, I was thinking of something wildly extravagant, something fantastically exotic like... Tram ride to the movies? - Okay, but you be home by 12. Otherwise, plenty trouble, alright? - Okay. - Okay. - Oh, Jenny, I forget. Letter come for you today. - Might be from Dad. It's from our neighbors, the Bartletts. Diamond's foal will be a two-year-old soon. They're hoping to sell her as a racehorse. - Hey, come on, it's not all that bad. - I'm just a bit homesick, that's all. - Okay, look. There's a good movie on telly tonight. Let's eat. - Ah, telly. All the bad girls with the big bubloons. (chortling) - Okay, put him in his stall. - Don't worry about him. He'll never race again. - What'll they do with him? - Oh, the owner'll sell him at the auctions. Got too many horses to worry about this one. No one wants a broken down gelding. End up in a can as dogs' meat. - I got your message. Not at all happy about taking this new filly on, Bill. - Now listen, Mac. Diamond Queen is a great mare. She might be a bit cranky, but she won the Melbourne Cup, and I reckon she can produce one just as good as herself. Now, either you train her daughter, or you don't train any of my horses. Simple as that. I mean it, Mac. - Now, you know the chances of Diamond Queen producing one as good as herself is a million to one. I tell you, Bill, that Diamond breed's just no good at all. - Now, listen, Mac. It's my horses and my money keeping you in business. You give that filly a try. If she's no good, I'll put her in the sales ring, but give her a try first. (brakes hissing) - G'day. (angry whickering) She's cranky, as mad as a hatter. - I'm paying you to transport, not give her a character reference. - Charlie, calm those colts down. (tense instrumental music) Get up. Jenny, help get this thing off the float. - Coming, sir. (music gentles) Now put it in the stable. (sighs) Look, Bill, this darn lunatic'll have every horse in the stable going berserk. - Well, it's your job to calm her down and get her ready for racing. That's what I'm paying you for. - (sighs) But why this nuisance? Buy yourself a decent horse. Give yourself a chance. I mean, it costs as much to feed a champion as it does to feed a rat bag like this. - Well, I know Diamond can produce a good 'un, and this might just be it. - [McIntyre] Didn't even get it in the stall. - [Bill] Don't you worry, you'll see. - Excuse me? - Yes, girly? - [Jenny] What's her name? - I've called her Blue Fire Lady. (tender instrumental music) - I tell you, she's mad, Boss. She just hates people. Well, you know, you saw her throw me at the track. - Yeah, just like mother and the rest of the darn breed. - You've only got one chance with that filly. She's a one-man horse, just like her mother. - Aw, this is 1977, Gus. If the horse can't be part of a team, it's no good to me. Training's a business. I'm a horse trainer, not a head doctor for scatty horses. - Look, Peters is expecting results. Now, Charlie's scared of her and the filly knows it. Why don't you leave her to that new girl to look after. It's your only chance of getting her to race. Look, the yearling sales are coming up soon. You're expecting Peters to dig into his pocket and buy you a couple of good colts, but he won't, unless you make some attempt with the filly. - Charlie? Give that darn filly to the new girl. - Yes, Boss, with pleasure. (dog whimpers) - Haven't you got rid of this darn nuisance dog yet? - Oh, I didn't know. - Well, you know now. Get rid of it. This is a racing stable, not a dogs' refuge home. - Yes, Boss. Come on, you dirty old fleabag, come on. Move! (Betty laughing) Get up, now move! - I'll just be a minute. Can I speak to you for a moment, please, Mr. McIntyre? - What is it this time? - Can I have Bobby? - [McIntyre] What do you mean can you have him? - I'd like to keep him. (McIntyre scoffs) I'll take him home so he won't be any trouble to you anymore. - That old dog's nearly 15. He's deaf as a post. No, Charlie's taking him to the vet. It's time he was put down. Anyway, you'll have enough to worry about with that new filly. I'm giving her to you to look after. Now, forget about the dog. Go back to work and let me get on with mine. - Please, sir. - (heavy sighing) Good Lord, girl, if it means that much to you, take the darn dog, but I don't want to see him hanging around here. Now, will you get on with your work? - Yes, thank you, thank you very much. - Animal lovers will be the end of me. - Please, Mrs. G. He won't be any trouble and I'll pay for his keep. - No, no dogs. - But he's got nowhere to go. No one wants him. - Ha, if no one wants him, that must mean he's no good for nothing. - But Mrs. G, he's such-- - No, I said no dogs. - Now wait a minute, Mrs. G. This is becoming a very rough neighborhood. You could use a good watchdog. - You mind your business, mister cheeky smarty-pants. - But, Mrs. G, think how safe you'd feel with a trained guard dog to look after you. - What do you mean, trained guard dog? - That's right, Mrs. G. This dog is famous all over town. In fact, they hire him out to guard all the favorites before the big races. This is a really important dog. - Where is this big-time guard dog? - He's out the front, I'll get him. - How come you know so much, mister cheeky smarty-pants? - Everyone's heard of this dog. - If he's such a good guard dog, how I know he don't bite me, 'eh? - Because he never bites kind, lovable people, Mrs. G. - Ah, get away with your goo-goo eyes. You first-class conman. Okay, mister, come here. What's the matter, you? I said come here. If you're gonna stay here, I want you to know who to guard. - I'm afraid he's a bit deaf. You have to pat your knee, like this, so he can see you want him to come. (dog panting) - Okay, mister, you stop with the goo-goo eyes. You can stay. - [Jenny] Oh, thank you! - Hey, stop the fuss. Hey, hey. If this guard dog deaf, how come he can hear burglars? You tell me, 'eh? - He, he smells them. He sniffs them out. Don't you, fella? - No. I think you old-timer nobody wants no more. We all get that way. Hey, Mr. Dog, you stop with the goo-goo eyes. Hey, you like ravioli? Hey, he like my cooking. You know, I think this a pretty smart dog. (all chuckling) (tender piano music) - You'll never quieten that lunatic. The sooner she gets aboard, the better, before she hurts somebody. - Steady. Don't make it hard for both of us. Come on. (music increasing) (gunfire on TV) - [Barry] Goodnight, Mrs. G. - [Jenny] Goodnight. - Goodnight you two. Hey, you be home by 12 o'clock, you remember, or else there'll be trouble. Hey, hey, Mr. Dog, you hungry? You like a salami sandwich? Hey. Be good. Hey, hey you know something? You got good taste. (chuckles) - Our trusty steed, the tram, awaits. - Well, thank you, Prince Charming. - For an ugly old stable hand, you sure turned into a beautiful princess. - Well, if you're the prince, you must have started life as a frog. Come on, we'll miss the tram. Mrs. G's right, you are a first-class conman. (soft chattering) - Fancy an ice cream? - [Jenny] Mm, thanks. - Well, if it isn't our collector of useless animals, all dressed up. Wanna come for a ride with the boss, sweetie? - I'm waiting for a friend. - A friend? I didn't think you were the friendly type. - Go away. - Listen, stuck-up, who do you think you are? You keep treating my like a fool, and I'll make your life miserable for you. - I treat you like a fool because you behave like one. You're a little bully who's not much good at his job. - I'll fix you right up from now on. Every cranky bare-legged horse that comes in the stable I'll line up for you to look after. I fix smarties like you. - Smarties like who? - Huh, who's this, one of your fresh riding school mates? - Hey, come on, I think you better tell the lady you're sorry. - What lady? - Come on, Barry, let's go. - Come on, Shorty, I said you better say the lady you're sorry. - Drop dead, creep! - Now, listen, I'm bigger than you, and I got a black belt. So, come on, tell the lady you're sorry. Go on, say, I'm sorry, lady. - I'm sorry. - I said, I'm sorry, lady. - I'm sorry, lady! - That's it, you could be a nice boy if you try. Goodnight, everyone. - You dirty pig! - I didn't know you did karate. - I don't. All I said was I have a black belt, and I do. - Here's the tram. (tender guitar music) - That girl's got Blue Fire Lady going along nicely, mate. - Ah, it's a long way to the racetrack. - I think the filly's ready for education at the barriers. - Yeah, could be right. We'll try her out at the starting gate tomorrow. We'll see just how good a job that girl has done. (rapid tempo music) - [Jenny] Steady, it's alright. Come here. - Alright, lead her in. - Why don't you take one of the others in first. When she sees it's safe, then she'll go, too. - Get ahold of her, take her up. - Right, Mr. Mac. - It's already, Betty, I'll get off and lead her in. Come on. Come on. Just hold it a second 'til she has a look. There you are. It's alright. No one's gonna hurt you. Come on. (music increasing) - Okay, let 'em go. - Okay. (frenetic instrumental music) (terrified whinny) - Blasted, crazy animal! - Are you alright? - She okay? What the hell happened? - Well, she was going beautifully. Then she just swerved off the track. - [McIntyre] I've just about had enough of this horse. - I know I can get her to race. She just needs to trust me. - Yeah. - You alright? Here we go. (pleasant instrumental music) Right? Well, you've done it. I'd say she's ready to race. - She'll be alright, as long as they take her easy. (tender instrumental music) - [Barry] I thought riding was supposed to be fun. I've had it. - [Jenny] Come on, you've earned a break. - [Barry] We just leave 'em? - [Jenny] They'll be okay. They'll not wander off. - [Barry] I don't think I've quite got the hang of it yet, though. The horse wants to go one way and I'm trying to go the other. - [Jenny] Got to let the know what you want to do. - So you finally won your battle with the horse. - Not a battle, more a test of patience. Because of her breeding, everyone treated Lady like an outlaw. So, she behaved like one. - When's her first race? - Saturday. That'll be her real test. Strange rider in a strange place. - You're not happy, are you? - I don't know. I'm not sure if I've done Lady a favor by getting her quiet enough to race. - Why? - People like McIntyre and Peters treat horses as racing machines. Lady worked for me because I treated her as an individual. - Ah, you shouldn't worry. You've done your best. Hey, have you heard from your father lately? - No, he never answers my letters. - You miss him a lot, don't you? Any time I can help, Jen. - Thanks, I know. (birds singing) (rapid instrumental music) (low chattering) - [Announcer] Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of the Victoria Amateur Turf Club, welcome to racing at Caulfield. The weather, fine, the track is officially good, and if you have your race books handy now, we'll check alterations throughout the break. - Well, it's a big day for you, Mac. Three in and two favorites. What do you reckon about Black Knight? - Oh, it should go close. Track work's been spot on. - [Bill] What about my filly in the sixth? - I still say that Blue Fire Lady's nothing but trouble. She nearly killed the girl looks after her. - But does she have a chance? - Well, with Clegg on her, Bill, one of the best whip riders around, he won't take any nonsense. If she's got any ability at all, Clegg'll get it out of her. - Well, I gotta give you full marks, Mac. At least you tried. If she doesn't pay her way now, you can kick her out, but I still reckon that old mare can produce at least one good one. - She might, but not this one. - Come on, I want to get something on Black Knight. - Prince Amure, 100 to 10, Prince Amure, at 277. - [Announcer] For number four, Act Again. The first race on the program, one scratching, number seven, Ellen's Hope leaving the board. - Sky Limit $12 to one, fill out your three. Seven, eight, nine, the Park Silent gives 492. Black Knight, 900 to 400, fill out your polls. Thank you, price on the boards. Here they are, four to one, Silent Kid. - [Announcer] Yes, the winnows have have placed the line. (crowd chattering) - Now, the last of the runners has gone into the stalls. They're all set for the first event on the program. Stand. (bell dings) Racing, this time, and Count John away well from Jim's Hope. Black Knight got away nicely, and then Day End followed by Jolly Let. Into the straight now and Count John the leader with Jim's Hope and Black Knight fighting on on the outside, followed by Miss Park and Day End, but Count John's gonna be much too good. He's striding right away from the mound. Count John's gonna win it easily from Jim's Hope. (aggravated growl) - Better luck, mate. - That's not good enough. - I know, I saw the race, too. - [Announcer] And last of all is Dingo. - [Announcer] Yes, the winnows have place the line. (crowd chattering) - He just wasn't himself, Mr. Mac. Something seems to have upset him today. - Yeah. - [Announcer] Get bet outs! - [Announcer] And the fill on the race, $94, even. There's the totes pending correct weight on the maiden two-year-olds. (somber instrumental music) - You know what this breed's like, so I don't want you to take any nonsense. Give her a darn good hiding. Peters will see she's not worth the trouble. - Okay, Mr. Mac, you're the boss. - I've got 100 on this horse at 50 to one, so it looks like the bookie she had max pinning. I'll tell you this, Kelvin. And if this horse wins, then there's a little something extra for you, alright? - Thank you, Mr. Peters, I appreciate that. Thank you. - Remember, show her who's boss. You've got to hit her, she needs it. - Right. (military drumming) - [Announcer] Now the runners are about to leave the mounting enclosure on their way to the 1200 meter barrier for the running of the TAA Stakes. Times will start in about four minutes. - Treat her kindly and she'll be alright. She's just frightened. (sentimental instrumental music) - The filly of yours look sloppy, Mac? - Yeah, lively and useless. - Yeah, Clegg'll earn his money for this ride. (crowd chattering) - Now the runners are moving into the stalls for the TAA Stakes. Starting to come along quite well. Millson's Pride has gone to the inside position. Paul Bray is ready with Green Sword and Fair Enough. Sticky's Head just goes in now. Waiting on about four or five of them. Blue Fire Lady's on her tares, getting left behind the other runners. Now coming up towards the line is Pine Duke. Pine Duke almost in as they close the stall behind him. And it's Blue Fire Lady and The Turk to go in. Oh, Blue Fire Lady pulls away suddenly there, nearly unseated Clegg. Now, the attendants are going to cross to The Turk, taking him forward, and we wait only now on Blue Fire Lady. Jockey Kelvin Clegg having a lot of trouble with Blue Fire Lady. She's not interested at all in going into the stalls. Blue Fire Lady swings away. Clegg giving her a couple of cracks with the whip there-- - Stop hitting her. - To try and make her go in. Clegg gives it a hit across the neck to try-- - Stop hitting her. - And settle her down. Now another at the femur head. - Please stop hitting her. - Clegg trying to master the filly. I think has now. The attendants bring her up. Oh, she swings sideways, there. Nearly collected one of the them. She's obviously still very green, doesn't know a lot about this business. Now they're bringing her forward. Blue Fire Lady's gone in and they're all set to start. Sticky's Hope sitting back a little. The Turk moving in the stalls, and Blue Fire Lady's still pretty toey on the outside. Mr. Morrow giving them time to settle down. (bell dings) They're off now! (tense instrumental music) Zipping down the strip, verily. (announcer drown out by music) Coming down the wall to the turn now, Mister's Call leader, just in front of Sticky's Hope. They're all followed then by The Turk and out from outside is Blue Fire Lady, making the turn very overly, however, taking The Turk out wide, and Future Eight just trim in front of The Turk, coming up on two. He's back in the lead now, and Blue Fire Lady to try and keep it straight. It's Blue Fire Lady under vigorous punishment, with The Turk going stride for stride, quite an unusual stride. About halfway down the straight now. Nothing between the two on the outside and Blue Fire Lady with Clegg throwing everything at Blue Fire Lady. They're going to get over Millson's Pride. They have run strong, fair enough. With 100 meters to go now, they'll have vigorous riding. It's Blue Fire Lady just in front of The Turk. On the inside, Millson's Pride struggling on, but it's The Turk and Blue Fire Lady. Clegg trying everything at this route. Blue Fire Lady, she's just in time. Stride for stride, they go to the line. Blue Fire Lady under desperate punishment now from Clegg, just in front of The Turk. The Turk coming at her again on the outside. Blue Fire Lady and The Turk, absolutely run together. And the long shot, Blue Fire Lady's won about a head to The Turk, Millson's Pride third. - You shifty devil, a 50 to one shot. - Good on ya, mate. Come on, let's get down there. - Ah, due for a change of luck. - [Announcer] The winner, number nine, Blue Fire Lady, is raced by Mr. And Mrs. Bill Peters, trained by C H McIntyre, a chestnut filly by Prince Charming out of Diamond Queen, and was ridden by Kelvin Clegg. Second, number five, The Turk, Jay Betts, and third, number one, Millson's Pride, ridden by A Tulley. - Well done. - Well, I threw everything at her, and she, she acted like a champion. - Good. Send her to the weigh truck, hose her down, and take her home. (audience applauding) - Congratulations, Bill. The Graduation Cup has been well-won. - Thank you, very much, and it certainly has been a thrill for one of my horses to win the TAA Graduation Stakes. - [Reporter] Pretty good win, eh, Mac? - Well, certainly did it the hard way. - Clegg gave that filly a real thrash with the horse having its first start. Are you happy with that? - Couldn't be happier. Clegg ran precisely my instructions. Off the record, gentlemen, the horse is real crank and needed a good hiding. - You wouldn't have had much on that at 50 to one, would you, Mr. Peters? - Oh, it was only a small cent of the pent, and at 50 to one, you don't have to lay out much. (chuckles) You better not print that, but you can quote me as saying I give full marks to Mac for having the patience and know-how in handling a horse that's been very, very difficult. - Thanks. You might let us know if it's gonna happen again. - My pleasure, thank you, gentlemen. - Thanks, all, very much. - Bill Peters, you cunning diddle, a 50 to one shot and you never told me. - Well, I didn't think the filly had it in her, Kate. - You're so lucky. We spend a fortune on our horses and never had a sitting win. - Well, thanks to Mac, here, this could be a good one. - Yeah, well, I'm jealous, and the only thing that'll cure me is a glass of champagne. - Oh, that's easily fixed, isn't it? Hey, Harry, two bottles of bubbly. Now, come on, Mac, the champagne's on me. (hearty laughter) (tender instrumental music) - Oh, you and your filly sure made them eat their words today. - I'm sorry, Gus, I just can't feel happy about it. In fact, I'm ashamed to be part of this whole miserable business. Look at her. I helped him do that. - Yeah, he gave her a hiding, alright. But you can't blame him. That's what they pay for. That's his job. - He didn't have to beat her. She would've given everything she had. - I'll get some liniment. I'll take the sting out of it. She won't feel much like her dinner tonight, that's for sure. (car motor rumbling) (drunken laughter) - How could I miss, at 50 to one. - Yeah, that boy certainly knows how to handle it. Come on, mate. About time you knock off, girl. What are you waiting around for? - I've been caring for Lady. - [Mac] And how is our scatty little filly? - Scatty winning little filly. (both laughing) - She's sick, sick and sore. She's off her food and suffering from shock. - Shock? - Yes, shock, due to being beaten by that whip-happy jockey, under your orders. - Now you just listen to me- - Hey, wait, wait a minute, Mac. Now, listen, girly, you know we had to get a strong rider to handle that filly, and what's more, you did a great job getting her on the track. So, here. Here's a (paper money snapping) little Christmas present. - I wouldn't touch your filthy money if I was starving. You treated Lady abominably today. That's nothing new. Charlie's allowed to run this place while you sit in your office playing Mr. Big. - You, you get out. - Don't worry, I'm going. But first, I'd like to say something to you, Mr. McIntyre. Your horses'll never go well for you, because you're not a horse lover. You just love the fame, and glory, and trimmings that go with racing, and worse than that, you're cruel, cruel and stupid, and those horses know it. - Get out. Get out and don't come back. - Well, you certainly told him where to get off. - Oh, I'm as much to blame as anyone. I could see what was gonna happen. I just wanted to show them that Lady could be a racehorse, to prove McIntyre and Charlie wrong. - You did that, alright. But what happens now? - I don't know. After what happened today, she'll hate the race course and everything connected with it. - And you won't be there to help her. - Okay, okay, enough sad faces. Come on, we eat. Tonight, I got plenty of lasagna. - No, thanks, Mrs. G. - Hey, I'm boss, here. When I say we eat, we eat. - Now Linda's Electa's gone in. The only one we're waiting on is Blue Fire Lady. Got a leading strap on her, now. Three attendants behind, trying to link arms, getting her up. Oh, she's lashed out, there. The attendants have scattered. And I think the starter, Mr. Morrow, might've lost his patience. He's gone across to the phone, now, and ringing the chief steward. Now just stand by. Broadcast. Yes. Right. Thank you. Just stand by for public announcement. Ladies and gentlemen, Blue Fire Lady has been withdrawn by the stewards, acting on advice from the starter, and book makers are advised to line their books, and an announcement regarding betting will be made after the race. Now they're all in the stalls. Blue Fire Lady has been withdrawn by the steward. - She won't go through that again. The more they bully her, the worse she'll get. - Your mount, Blue Fire Lady put on a disgraceful exhibition at the barrier, Clegg. In due of her past record, we have to seriously look at banning her. Do you have any comment to make? - No, sir. This filly's a real crank. She's been a handful from the first time she set foot on a course. She showed ability at her first up, but she's been a big disappointment since. - Alright, thank you, Clegg. - Thank you, sir. - Mr. Morrow? - I consider this filly one of the worst cases I've seen in my experience as starter. In this race, we found it impossible to get her in. I had no choice other than to withdraw her. - Mr. McIntyre, have you any questions you wish to ask the starter? - No, I agree. In my opinion, gentlemen, I don't think there's anything to be done to make this horse more tractable. I've done everything humanly possible, given every chance. Thankfully, I was able to get one race out of her, for Mr. Peters. I now believe it would be a waste of time to persevere. - Alright, thank you, gentlemen. - Blue Fire Lady, who again put on a shocking performance before the start, was withdrawn by the stewards and has been banned from future racing. The stewards reported that despite several warnings, the trainer had been unable to cure the horse of her waywardness. Your Mr. Peters isn't gonna be too pleased. - I'm glad. At least she won't be beaten be Clegg anymore. - [Gus] You got a minute? - Hi, Gus, great to see you. - How are you? - Fine. - You know that the filly's had it? - Yes, I read it in the papers. - It was Charlie. After you left, he couldn't do a thing with her. Peters is putting her up in the sales next week. - What do you think'll happen to her? - Could end up anywhere. She'll certainly never race again. - The sale's next week? - Uh huh. - I've gotta go, thanks, Gus. - Oh, by the way, I heard Peters mention a reserve of $1,000. - Hi, Jen, what's up? - Lady's being sold next week. - Oh, what's the problem? - I want to buy her. - Buy her? Yeah, terrific idea. What are you gonna do for money? Horses cost a fortune. - Eh, not horses that won't race. - Well, count us in as a shareholder. How much do you need? - [Jenny] Gus says they'll be a reserve of $1,000. She shouldn't make much more. - A grand? - (sighs) If I can find a way to rake up the money, the Bartletts'll look after her until I get a new job. - Great, but what about the 1,000? - I've saved nearly 300. (strident honking) I thought... Well, I was hoping, if you have any money to spare, I'd pay you back. - Look, Jen, you know I'd give you anything I've got, but the most I could rake up is the 50 or 60 bucks I'll get here, and Mrs. G's just as hard up. - [Jenny] But we can't let her be sold to just anyone. - Yeah, what about your father? - (scoffs) Dad? You know how he feels about horses. He wouldn't buy me a horse in a million years, especially not this one. - Well, why don't you write to him again, and explain the whole thing? It's worth a try, isn't it? - I guess so. - Hi. Sorry, nothing today. Perhaps Monday. - Monday'll be too late. It had to be today or never. - Nevermind. - Thanks. - [Barry] Any word? But the sale's today. What are you gonna do? - I'll have to go and have a look. I must find out what happens to her. - I'll give you a lift. - No thanks, I'll take the tram. I've got to think things out a bit. - Sure. (tender instrumental music) - See ya. - That poor girl's heart is broke. Ah, not just the horse. She think her papa don't love her no more. He don't even answer her letter. What kind of man her papa? - I don't know, Mrs. G, but I'm gonna find out. - What you gonna do, Barry? - I think I'll have a word with our Mr. Grey. - Jenny's papa? - Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do. - [Announcer] The auctioneer reserves the right to refuse to accept any particular bid or bids. The auctioneer may fix an upset price, and from time to time, may fix the amount of rises in bid. Except where lots are announced as being sold to dissolve a partnership, sellers may make one bid only. (horse whickering) - Looks as mad as a hat snake. - Stick a flank rope on her, she'd buck her brand off. - If she's wild enough, we could get her on the circuit. - Could get her for a grand. No one else would want a psycho case like that. (announcer speaking through PA) - Hello, Lady. It's alright. I won't hurt you. - Oy! (crowd chattering) - Not much of a crowd, Frank. - Catalog's not much good, there, John, dog meat buyer over there'll pick out the broken down ones. Rodeo fellows are looking for a lively type. - Alright, well, let's get on with it, then. The following are the conditions of sale. The highest bidder at or over seller's reserve shall be the buyer. Errors of description, whether as to soundness, condition, quality, fitness, pedigree, engagements-- (car rumbling) - [Alan] What the hell are you doing? - Mr. Grey? Alan Grey? - Yes? - It's about your daughter. There isn't much time. - Jenny, what's happened? - Nothing's happened, but unless you wake up yourself, Jenny's gonna suffer. - How dare you threaten me. Who are you anyway? I know, it's about this horse. She sent you to-- - She didn't send anyone. I came because I care about her. I came because she blames herself for what happened to Blue Fire Lady. Look, why don't you just buy her the horse? - I'm not interested. Now you can turn round and can drive-- - When I've finished! Look, Mr. Grey, no one can bring back your wife, and no one can promise that the same thing isn't gonna happen to Jenny. She's trying to save something she loves. I guess you understand that, don't you, Mr. Grey? - Reference to a positive test does not constitute-- (tender instrumental music) (auctioneer drown out) The auctioneer will not in any circumstances be liable or responsible to the buyer for the death of any animal, or loss of, or injury, or damage to any animal, or property left with animal while in auctioneer's possession, custody, or control, whether caused by auctioneer's negligence, or otherwise, how so ever. (crowd murmuring) This is lot 36, Blue Fire Lady, a winner of two years. As you can see, she's the daughter of a Melbourne Cup winner. Now, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to announce that we consider she's only a breeding prospect. This filly is subject to a stewards' ban for barrier behavior. There she is, where do we start, ladies and gentlemen? 500, four or five, 400, get her started. Start her where you like, then, I'm in your hands. Start her anywhere, five, four, three-- - $10. (crowd laughing) - Now, come on, let's be a little bit more serious. Come on, can I see a sensible start somewhere? Is there 300, 200, four? We'll get her started. Start her where you like. In your hands now, come on, can I see a sensible start-- - $100. - [Auctioneer] Somewhere? Is that a bid? - $100. - $100 I'm bid here, now. At 100 to start. 100, a bid, 100, starting with a $100. Now at one, a bid of one, I'm bid here, now, at 100 to start. (auctioneer chanting) - There's a few cans in that lunatic. - $100, now at one, I'm only at bid of $100, bid here now. - 150. - This! - 150. At 150 again for a starter, now at 150, I'm bid. 150, at 150 again for a starter, now, at 150, a bid. - 300. - 300, a bid, 300, now, 300, here, on the left, at 300, bid, at 300, bid, 300 now, on Blue Fire Lady, 300, a bid, I got 300, now, no more? - 400 - At 300! At 400, over here. At 400, a bid, now, and this is where we should've started. 400, a bid here, now, at 400, now, at 400, no further. At $400. (close mumbling) I'm told he's reduced the reserve to $600, sir. Will you take her for that? - We'll take her. (audience laughing) - $600, done, all done. (gavel bangs) 600, you bought her, sir. And we're back in the sequence, here, ladies and gentlemen, and this is a yearling filly by the great Better Boy performer, Century. Century, this is amongst his first crop. They're yearlings. (sentimental music) - Hi. - She's been sold to a rodeo. - Take it easy. Why don't we just go and have a word with them? - No, I can't. - Come on. (music increasing) - Dad! - Looks like we've just bought ourselves a horse. ♪ Morning, on another sunny day ♪ ♪ Feeling good, in a most exciting way ♪ ♪ Doing things and being with the ones you love ♪ ♪ Just being there is all you're thinking of ♪ ♪ Daylight, and you're flying with the wind ♪ ♪ Just feel it ♪ Ain't it blowing in your face ♪ ♪ It's all yours, but you share it with the ones you love ♪ ♪ 'Cause a little bit of love goes a long way ♪ ♪ A little bit of love goes a long, long, way ♪ (audience applauding) ♪ Morning on another sunny day ♪ Feeling good in a most exciting way ♪ ♪ Doing things and being with the ones you love ♪ ♪ Just being there is all you're thinking of ♪ ♪ Daylight and you're flying with the wind ♪ ♪ Just feel it ♪ Ain't it blowin' in your face ♪ ♪ It's all yours ♪ But you share it with the ones you love ♪ ♪ 'Cause a little bit of love goes a long way ♪ ♪ A little bit of love goes a long, long way ♪ ♪ Blue Fire Lady ♪ All she needs is love ♪ Blue Fire Lady ♪ Love is just enough ♪ When you're young ♪ When you're free ♪ When you've still got room to breathe ♪ (instrumental bridge)
