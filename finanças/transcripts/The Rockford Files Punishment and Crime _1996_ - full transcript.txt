Buddy, forward. I know. I told him, you know. Of course you've got your agenda and all that, but the grant money's drying up fast, and it's unconscionable that you... (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) MAN: In or out, pal? I'm sorry. (BLUES MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) Is that all the further you've got since 7:00 this morning? Hey, it's your lookout. If the job takes two days, two weeks, I could care less. These steps need to be sanded and resealed. Boy, you got some brass peach pits, makin' a friend work off a promissory note. You think I wouldn't rather have a qualified painter? I had to have some periodontal work done. Okay, so I happen to be one of the 18 million unemployed right now without a safety net. What am I supposed to do, let the teeth rot? You don't have a safety net because you haven't worked for Ringling Brothers or any other kind of gainful employment for over 10 years. With my heart murmur? Here's your Henry's Compound for the roof. Oh, yeah. Your high-pressure nozzle? Don't lose this one. (MUSIC STOPS) Hey, they're about to play a half hour of Willie. Yeah, yeah. (DIAL TONE) (DIALING) (LINE RINGING) YOUNG JOSIE: Hello? Hello. Is, uh, is Megan there? Just a minute. Bingo. Mom, there's some man for you on the phone. MEGAN: Okay, well, just hang on a second. Hello? Hello, Megan? MEGAN: Uh-huh. It's Jim Rockford. Jim? Oh, my God, Jim! YOUNG JOSIE: Who's Jim? MEGAN: Now, what have I asked you when I'm on the phone? No, no, that goes in the sink. Uh, is that a daughter? Yeah. I have a son, too. God, it's been like, what, 15 years? Yeah, at least. You know, I was on campus today. At the Psychology Department? You're kidding. Yeah. I, uh, I was at a client meeting. I didn't get the job, but, uh... Aw, geez. We passed in the elevator. What? I was shocked into silence. You know, the last time we talked, you and Michael had moved to Atlanta. Well, I'm back. I'm divorced. Oh? Yeah, me, too. It'd be wonderful to see you. Uh-huh. In fact, it's my father's birthday Sunday. We're throwing a party for him at his Santa Barbara house. Why don't you come? Oh. Uh, you know, I, I don't know. Uh. Okay. Yes! (LAUGHS) Hey! Is that Jim Rockford? Frank, I feel like I'm crashing your hootenanny here. Oh, no, no. Just what I need, another birthday, huh? By the way, this is not Parkinson's induced. And I didn't trip over my walker, either. Newest grand kid just got me with the Similac. Oh, boy. (CHUCKLES) Come on. Yeah, you know, I was, I was glad to hear Megan say that you might show. Hey, I'll bet the Reagan years were good to you, huh? S&L investigations, defense contractor fraud. Matter of fact. (LAUGHS) Well, 1, uh, I sold the talent agency. It's part of UTA now. I'm enjoying myself. Hey, waiter. Yes, sir. You were supposed to bring lime slices to the lady in the black dress 10 minutes ago. Never mind. It's a little late now. Come on, Jim, I'll take you to my favourite daughter. Guess you heard the marriage of the century is over. ROCKFORD: I never heard it referred to as that. FRANK: Someday I'll learn to shut my big mouth. Megan. It's Jim. ROCKFORD: Hi, Meg. Jim? FRANK: Here people, I brought the limes. Put any tips right here in the bowl. It's so good to see you. (ROCKFORD CHUCKLES) Jim, uh, this is my sister, Josie. Hi, Jim. Dougherty people! There's a function at the junction. I'm sorry I'm late. Forgive me, Godfather. Hello, Patrick. MEGAN: I didn't think you were going to make it. Oh, I'm sorry. I had a client meeting run late. Uncle Patrick! Uncle Patrick! Oh! Come, here, doll face. MEGAN: This is my daughter, Josie. My cousin, Patrick. Jim Rockford. Jim Rockford? Megan's "road-not-traveled"? Oops. Patrick. Oh, Jim, Molly. Molly, Jim. Hi, Molly. Let's see. No, we're at the wrong table. We are, we're at Ice Station Zebra. Say good-bye to the nice people. Bye, everybody. MEGAN: Bye. How's your dad? Rocky died late last year. Oh, no. I'm so sorry. You two had such a special relationship. I miss him. He was always a major fan of yours. Really? He was funny that way. He wasn't an educated man, but, uh, his judgment of people was usually dead on. Hmm. Of course, he called me "sonny" right up to his death. Well, that's parents. Will and I are bored, Mom. We're gonna go down on the beach, see if there are any people doing it. Excuse me? Grandpa doesn't want anyone on the cliffs because of the erosion. Now, say hello to Mr. Rockford. This is my son, Daniel. It's Jim. Hi, Daniel. Hi. MEGAN: What's your sister doing? She and Kate are acting like dorks. YOUNG JOSIE: Hey, Daniel, come here! He's quite a guy. You think so? (CLINKING) That's good. Clinking. Oh. We've heard many grand and heartfelt tributes to Francis Dougherty today. From his children, in particular. And, uh, while I'm not a member of that august body, I'd say I'm about as close as one can get without the requisite advanced degree from Yale and prescription for Prozac. (PATRICK CHUCKLES) MAN: Ooh! But because of that, he has, to his credit, six extraordinarily accomplished, if annoying, children, a legacy as fountainhead of one of the most powerful and, uh, blah-blah-blah, literary and talent agencies ever to exist in this town. As, as Frank himself once said, he never met a control issue he didn't like. (ALL CHUCKLING) Whoa! Hang on. (PATRICK LAUGHS) When my, uh, father, his brother, died, my uncle was there for me. He tried. So, the part everybody likes, we get to drink. Here is to Uncle Fountainhead. Uh, happy birthday. WOMAN: Whoo! Yeah! Happy birthday! WOMAN: Patrick! Whoo! I never heard you mention your cousin before. Really? He's kind of a fixture. Your brother Peter's an interesting guy. What does he do? He's an entertainment lawyer. You know, he went into the family business. VALET: Gold Fire bird! I don't think he likes it very much. Oh? Are we there? Well, that's me, right here. Well... (CHILDREN CHATTERING) I'll call you tomorrow, okay? Okay. Bye-bye. Bye, Jim! Bye, Josie. Grandpa's gonna kill you. Why don't you shut up? (MOLLY SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) WOMAN: Is anybody hurt? Hey, are you all right? I don't believe this! (MOLLY GROANING) Molly, are you okay? Let me help you. What the hell's the matter with you? Look what you did, ace! ROCKFORD: Oh, you pulled right out in front of me! What, are you blind? Well, I'm not ripped on blow and Herradura, I'll tell ya that! PATRICK: What'd you say? You were slapping the backboards when you got here today. Want to say that again? I'll say it again. I got about 100 witnesses. FRANK: Patrick! Hey, son, don't do that. Patrick, for God's sake. (PATRICK GRUNTS) ROCKFORD: Here you go, Patrick. PETER: Patrick, that's enough! Patrick, you already had your license taken away! PATRICK: Let go of me! You stupid... MOLLY: Patrick, stop! Patrick. Stop. (MOLLY WAILING) FRANK: Thank you, Patrick. Excellent choice of birthday present. I don't suppose I could get some of that coffee without paying for it? That's all right. That's why I brought two cups. (LAUGHS) I see you met Mr. Wong last night. It's not worth talking about. No cream, huh? Oh, Jimmy. Man, I tell ya, sometimes I wonder, what does it all mean? What? ANGEL: Well, I mean, don't you ever wonder? Take me. Here I am, my age, with nothing, cleaning aluminum siding on my best friend's house. Angel, you are so full of self-pity. Oh, well, thank you, Reverend Schuller. I spent the evening with somebody who lost her sight in a car accident at the age of 15. You should see her attitude. That shrink you were bumping back in the early '80s? If you had to spend 10 minutes of your life as a blind person, you'd... You know what she said to me? Dodger Stadium's dark most nights? Look, Jimmy, I hear a sermon coming on, and I just don't feel... She said that she was in Las Vegas at a convention, uh, with her guide dog, and she was outside the casino. Some guy comes up, pats her on the head, stuffs a 50 in her hand, and then runs away before she can give it back. Yeah? So what's the point? Can you imagine the humiliation of somebody treating you like a rabbit's foot? Hey, I knew this little chick, Jim... Who's this? (GROANING) MOLLY: Babe, don't say anything to provoke him. Ugh, are you listening to me? Hey! Look, I'm sorry. You didn't call the police, and I appreciate it. I would've done jail time. Your cousin asked me not to. Now, get the hell out of here. Where do you get off talking to me like that? I gotta go work. This is my parking lot. I own it. I discovered this whole stretch of coastline. I'm Balboa, okay? You don't like it? Hi. I'm Molly. Looks like sucky work. All right, all right. I was somewhat drunk last night, but I was not high, I swear. I care less if you shoot up your foot powder or mix dragster fuel with pear grappa. Just don't come around me or mine. The shame is that if they find you with your face in a shag rug, it's gonna tear up your cousin pretty good. Well, actually, Megan's the one that suggested you and I talk. Sure, she did. The facilitator. Okay. But also, I, I need a private investigator. (SCOFFS) I'm supposed to work for you? Well, she said you didn't have a job. She said what? She meant for now, I'm sure. You know. There's an actor client of mine dropped out of sight. Actor client? Yeah. I'm a personal manager, uh, here. Uncle Frank flypaper you to the payroll? No, I'm on my own now, for over a year. It's a small but selective client list. Jack Nicholson, huh? Oh. Hootie & the Blowfish? All right, who, then? Well, Molly, for one. I also represent fitness guru Pablo Cohen, and the writing team of Schneider and Frolov. Okay, listen, the client I'm worried about is named Ykaterina Stepashin. She's Russian. Major film star back in Russia. Unfortunately, she still hasn't been able to break through here. That's why I'm worried. She's been so depressed. I am not working for you, and you can tell your cousin I do not need a personal manager. Especially not her. My career's doing just fine. Fair enough. She's certainly tried to play therapist with me enough times, and it does wear thin. She asked you to ask me to find this Russian as a personal favor to her? Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm looking for a Ykaterina Stepashin. Uh, I'm told she's a regular here. Performs on occasion. English, no. Ah. Ah, yeah. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Ernesto! (SPEAKING SPANISH) ¡Alto, alto! Para el jefe. Su boss man. Mi teléfono. (ROCKFORD SPEAKING SPANISH) (DOORBELL RINGING) Oh, hi, Josie. How are you? Hi, Jim. Come on in. (DOOR CLOSING) May we offer you something to drink? Uh, no, thank you, Josie. AUTOMATED VOICE: 7:10 p.m. I'm fine. Hi! MEGAN: Hi. Let me just get them set up with dinner, and I'll be ready. Okay. Great. These guys and their cousins are flying off to Atlanta tomorrow to spend summer vacation with their dad. Oh, really? His new house has a pond, and we're gonna swim and catch leeches and stuff. And we're not afraid of those leeches, are we? Not any more. (CHUCKLES) FRANK: Hey, Jim. Oh, hi, Frank. Oh, I don't know, ... I can't get that Nintendo working. Well, thanks for trying. I wish you'd stay and have dinner with Daniel and Josie. Oh, nothing I'd like better, but no can do. Did I hear we're still going on about those leeches? Nope. It's all over and settled. Because, as I said, there couldn't be that many in a spring-fed pond. Anyway, all you have to remember about leeches... Okay, Dad, it's settled. You know, in the Seabees, we used to burn "em off with cigarettes... Okay, Dad, thank you! Don't shush me, Megan. I'm trying to explain to the child there's absolutely nothing to be afraid of. I know that. FRANK: Of course you do. MEGAN: About time, dude. I know. Mark got locked out of his house. Mmm-hmm. His mom will take our turn driving carpool. Good. Josie, egg? Wide, two o'clock, Mom. Thanks. FRANK: Jim, uh, I have to apologize for my nephew's behavior the other day. I guess every family has its Swamp Thing. I never said you didn't have a job. I said you were available. Oh, available. Excuse me. Well, aren't you? I do not need a personal manager. Stop repeating yourself. You're so proud of that line. Well, what's his problem, anyway? Patrick is very sweet, and bright. He's written great screenplays, which, of course, Hollywood doesn't get. He graduated the highest ever in Peace Corps language training. He's lived in Africa and, and Russia. He gave me a phrase book. Well, he speaks it fluently. He was one of the first capitalists in there after the '91 coup. He knows Yeltsin. I could tell from his driving. You two were always so close? I was in love with him. He was my big cousin, you know? So tell me about your marriage. You're not running this session. You first. Oh, boy. Well... (EXHALES) Michael and I still love each other. I don't know. He's a very angry man. More so every year. But time, kids, dueling careers... You know, the usual suspects. Well, speaking of kids, yours are terrific. They're much more responsible and self-assured than most children their age. Well, they've had to be. But thank you. So talk! About your marriage. Well... Kit's a great person, and the whole thing convinced me that I just don't want those kinds of complications in my life. Especially not at this age. Boy, I'm with you there. Hey, Dennis. I was just in the area. Oh, how's the cyst? You want to see it? I'd have nothing to compare it to. See you got an office with a window. Listen, I, I was just wondering, if possibly you could do me a favor? I'm gonna say this again, it's not the same old department. Things are different now. The King thing, 0.♪... Our reputation's in the toilet, our response time is now a matter of public amusement. Okay, Dennis, take a chill pill. No, it's not, "Okay, Dennis," okay? We're overloaded, yet the same negative voices come in here asking for special consideration. I just thought, as a friend, you might be happy to see me working again. Okay, what is it? Hmm. My dry spell's over, Dennis. It's my favourite kind of gig, too. Skip trace. Of course, it's your favourite. I use our MCT links. Seven out of 10 times, I turn your missing person, you collect your mark-up without leaving your rocking chair. "Y" Katerina Stepashin. Uh, the work. And a friend asked me to. What the hell are you talking about? What the hell are you talking about? I'm answering your question. I didn't ask you a question. You said, "Why Katerina Stepashin?" It's her name. Oh, no, Dennis, no. The "Y" is pronounced, "Yuh." Yuh-Katerina. It's Yuh-Katerina, not "Y." Oh. ROCKFORD: Damn! (SIGHS) Jimmy, it's Angel. It's 12:15. Make that 12:17. I'm gonna work for your bud, Pat Dougherty. He's got some DMV issues. Needs a driver. And, and I guess what, uh, I'm saying is, I quit. (BRAKES SCREECHING SOFTLY) (CAR DOOR OPENING) (CAR DOOR CLOSING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (KNOCKING CONTINUES) Yeah, I'm coming. Yeah? You are searching for Ykaterina Stepashin? Who are you? Did you find her yet? Did you have some information you wanted to impart? (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Who? (ROCKFORD GRUNTS) (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Who engaged you to find her? Who engaged you to find her? Oh, yeah. (STAMMERS) Patrick Dougherty, Patrick Dougherty. Where is Pat? Well, at home. That's where he works out of. Oh, no. Hey, don't! (GROANS) You must try harder. I don't know. (SCOFFS) Oh, you play golf. On occasion. Oh, Boris Andreyevitch is a scratch player. Boris Andreyevitch. What? Did you find Ykaterina Stepashin? (GROANING) Did you find Ykaterina Stepashin? No. No, it's the truth. (GROANING) (ROCKFORD BREATHING HEAVILY) Do you know where Pat's family lives? (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) I have to go now. I wish I didn't have to leave things on such basis. Oh! (GROANS) (EXHALES) (HORN HONKING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (ROCKFORD GROANING) Megan? Megan, it's Jim. Michael said he'd call as soon as the children landed. Oh, you worry so much. They'll all be fine. Even my horrific daughter. Come on, Buddy. Thanks a lot, Josie. I'll talk to you later. JOSIE: Bye, sis. MEGAN: Bye-bye. (ROCKFORD GROANS) Oh, no. (EXHALES) Who's there? I'll take the cans out in the morning. Jim? All right, the guy dressed in Fila, the tall guy called him Boris Andreyevitch? ROCKFORD: Yeah, right. I finally reached Molly. She says she hasn't heard from Patrick since yesterday morning. BECKER: Molly's the girlfriend? MEGAN: Yeah. Here's some more ice. She was pretty terrified. Are these Russians going to come after all of us? (ROCKFORD GRUNTS) These guys must've had KGB training. The North Korean Shiatsu. What'd you tell them? That's what scares me. I can't be sure. Ma'am, uh... Uh, did you warn family members of the possible danger? Yeah. They were all really upset. Thank God my children and my sister's children just went back East. Patrick, he writes great screenplays that nobody gets. Did I mention that, Dennis? (DEVICE CHIMING) And you have no idea who these men could be? No. Patrick knows so many Russians. He did some film financing over there, I think. And then for a while he was exporting Soviet Army overcoats. They were kind of hip a couple of years ago. He knows Yeltsin. You just won't stop, will you? (SIGHS) I tried Tevas. You ever wear 'em? If not, you got a treat coming. Officer Burgess tells me that the neighbors haven't seen anything out of the ordinary all day. How about a tall guy, whacked out on Haldol, staggering around with a handgun? Was there one? I wouldn't stay here, ma'am, or report to work. Oh, that's great. What am I supposed to do? Pack a bag. We'll deal with it. What does "We'll deal with it" mean? Your Y-Katerina surfaced. St. John's Hospital, OD. Satisfactory condition. This tall Russian guy came to my trailer looking for you. His name, Gennady Koblets. Koblets, Megan. Remember that. No, you can't tell him I'm here. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Russian, nyet. I'll give it to you. Look at this. It's for you. It's Cartier. See diamonds? It's pear-cut. No, no, thank you, please. Look, Gennady, is he Russian Mafia? Yes. Yes, Russian Mafia, yes. Uh, KGB? Uh, originally? MVD. Interior Minister. Medal, yes? Hero of Soviet Union. Now. (SCOFFS) (IMITATES SCOFFING) A changed man, in business for himself. Soviet Union. (SCOFFS) Gennady, is he friends with Patrick Dougherty? Yes. He is my manager. So nice. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Model Inc. Moscow Art Theater. Six years. So Patrick was supposed to get you established. To help you. Mmm, yes. He meet, met to me many people. But I don't work. Gennady was screaming. I swallow many capsules with vodka. Is this your first suicide attempt? (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) How sad. (EXHALES) Gennady is, is angry. He, he wants you back. He's very mad at Patrick. Please, don't tell him, Detective sir. I have a seat assignment. As soon as they lets me go from here, I am returning to Moscow. Tomorrow. (GASPS) Your arm! Hey. Take it. It's Venice. Fendi. No, no. Gennady give it to me. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Really. No, no, no. Look. It's very, very, very... Look, we're not going to tell him where you are, so just take the coat. ROCKFORD: We're going to have to call your father and tell him what's going on. Just stay there. Nurse! Ah. ROCKFORD: Hey, Frank. MEGAN: Daddy, what are you doing still here? Aren't you worried? No. We're headed for New York first thing in the morning, anyway. Want a drink? No. I'll have some wine. A little red, if you've got it. Yeah, sure. MEGAN: I'm going to sit down. Anyway, I've met Gennady Koblets. And he's not a complete moron. I have to believe he realizes that if he touches any one of my family, I have the kind of friends who can and will single him out for the cold room. Dad, he wants to kill Patrick. I said my own family. I'm not talking about Patrick. Anyway, he doesn't want to kill him. Punish him a little, yes. Thank you. Go a little Cossack on his dumb ass. Well, who knows, maybe he can succeed where Betty Ford, the Jesuits and the rest of us have failed. Here we go. Megan, the man is 43 years old. Flaky son of a bitch! Uh, how do you know Koblets? Through Patrick. Yet another attempt to get the nephew up and running. (FRANK EXHALES) A year ago, Koblets had some 15th century St. George icons from the State Museum. I have friends who are collectors. I made some introductions, helped Patrick with the negotiations. I can't believe this. That art is the patrimony of the Russian people. Pat Trimony? Didn't I used to represent him when he was married to what's-her-name? I'm delighted you find it so amusing. (SIGHS) Do you wish me to help your cousin in his battle with life? Huh? 'Cause, frankly, I'm a little confused about my role. I need to go to the bathroom. You all right? Yeah, yeah. (FRANK CHUCKLES) She's really something, isn't she? Oh, she's somethin', all right. Notice the way she took me to task? (FRANK LAUGHS) None of my other kids have that much spine. No, those leeches aren't waiting for you, honey. Leeches can't think. I miss you, too, and I wish I could be there to hug you to sleep, too. (EXHALES) Did you get to go to Ben and Jerry's? Oh. It was because you were thinking about those leeches. Try and remember Jo in Little Women. That's right, she has the same name as you, and she was very brave. Well, I love you, too, Jo-Jo-bean. Bye-bye, sweetie. Oh, my father, pain in the ass. Yeah, well, Rocky would've done the same. Nature lectures. Toughens you up. This was his place, huh? Yeah. His studio. Of course all he ever did was bring his buddies up here on the weekend and they'd watch games and barbecue kielbasa. Well, I can't unload it, but I still pay the taxes on it. It's a nice smell. Pine trees. If it shelters us from the Interior Ministry until we can find a way to talk Koblets down, then it'll have paid for itself. Okay, Buddy. Night. Go lie down. Let's not have that conversation about you taking the couch and I take the bed. Well, you sleep where you want. My bad back cuts into my chivalry these days. Why did you call me? JOHNNY: This professor works with Dimitri Kalcheim, the Russian expert. FESTA: Okay, bring him down. Yo, Professor. Mr. FESTA will see you. FESTA: Professor, what can I do for you? Mr. FESTA, I appreciate you seeing me. Do you mind? Uh, Mr. Kalcheim is a, an avid reader, and he was, uh, looking through the large-print edition of The Times, when he spotted an article mentioning both you and a Mr. Koblets. Koblets? Yeah, I know him. The paper said that you and Mr. Koblets had partnered up to purchase Atlantic City property. That partnership did not eventuate. Whole time they slipped us the blini. They're lower than the silverfish. Russians. It's like Averell Harriman. I'm sorry? FESTA: He was ambassador over there. He said, "With the Russians, you're always buying the same horse twice." JOHNNY: They ripped us off for $18 million. Let me tell you something about the Russian Mafia. They're violent, they're sociopathic. And a bath once in a while would be nice, too. Oh, that's not true, Rich. What? Are you gonna contradict me? This is a socio-cultural thing. I think it's so cold over there, taking a shower is not instilled in the young. I think it's up to the individual. I mean, Koblets with me was always well-groomed. (SIGHS) You don't know where Mr. Kalcheim could contact Mr. Koblets, do you? To the right enterprising party, I'd be willing to pay into the four figures for that same information. Is that right? (MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) You're not up yet? Mmm. It feels good. Were you able to reach Patrick? Uh-uh. Still no answer, and nothing on my service. (ROCKFORD SIGHS) You've just been lying here, huh? I took Buddy out, but it was too cold. Oh, and I, I banged into something and broke it. I think it was a bowling trophy or something. It felt like a little man with a ball. Anyway, he fell off his stand. I'll make us some coffee. Uh, you like tea, right? Listen, about last night... Oh, please. Not the first thing, huh? Okay. Then get back in. (SIGHS) That's not in. Come here. We got to get moving pretty soon. Okay, soon. I like this. Smelly old cabin, hanging in bed, no job to go to. You should have run off with your cousin. (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) You know, this is the problem with LA. Never get any show days. So you're liking this, too? The being here part, with you? Very much. (BIRD CHIRPING) That one bird, the high one, goes exactly every 17 seconds. (BIRDS CHIRPING) ROCKFORD: You want some Corn Flakes? Okay. I want to take a quick shower. Water's pretty brown. Uh-oh. I'm going to try Patrick again. See if he's checked in. (LINE RINGING) AUTOMATED VOICE: You have reached the personal secretary mailbox for Doctor... (BEEPS) Megan, hi. This is Rochelle. Uh, the numbers haven't been crunched yet, so don't bother... (BEEPS) PATRICK: Meg, you nut. Ten messages on my machine's a little excessive, don't you think? Jim. It's Patrick on the phone. PATRICK: Here I think I have a whole host of important calls, and they all turn out to be you. But seriously, there's nothing to worry about. I'm fine. I spent the night at a client's, Pablo Cohen. He, he was great about it. And yesterday I kept movin' around. Even maintained a full schedule of meetings. I mean, I got a lot of work done. Uh, I'm sorry if this caused you any hassle. I know Gennady Koblets. It'll blow over. I just talked to Molly. I'm gonna pick her up, and we'll chill at Two Bunch Palms for a couple of days. I'll call ya. Molly's. Get dressed, Megan. What are you thinkin' about? Josie and Daniel. I hope they're having fun with their dad. (TIRES SCREECHING) (CAR HORN HONKING) Damn. Buddy? Buddy, baby, are you okay? (BUDDY WHIMPERS) He's okay, he's okay. You stay right here. (MAN GROANING) Oh, Angel? Who's that? Call an ambulance. I'm hurt! Angel! Jimmy. Oh, God, it's horrible back there, it's horrible! What is? MEGAN: Jim? What's going on? You all right? Everybody okay? Yeah, yeah. I'm okay. Shoulders. Well, that's the seat belt. That's good. Here, get out. Come on, Buddy. ANGEL: Oh! Oh! (ANGEL GROANING) Oh! Stand right by the car. Oh. Help! Somebody call 911! Man injured! Angel, you're all right. Now, get out and help her. Why can't she help me? I'm losing cerebral fluid. Angel, just do it! Don't move me! Don't move me! PATRICK: No, please. (MOANING) Molly, honey. ROCKFORD: Oh, my God. (MOLLY GROANING) (WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PA) BECKER: I'm going to want you to look at some pictures, when you're up to it. MOLLY: Call my mom. She lives in Reno. She's in rough shape. One or both perps raped as well as beat her. It's not clear. Oh, God, Molly. No, please. Koblets? Apparently not. She knows Koblets. Two men. Russians. Maybe that Boris Andreyevitch guy. I'm so sorry about all of this. Jim, what they did to you... You've got no reason I can remember to call me Jim. Koblets blames you for not getting Miss Stepashin's career on track. Is that the assumption? Yeah. Things started out mediocre, then promptly went in the toilet. Ykaterina finally split on Gennady. That's when Mr. Dougherty hired me to try and salvage the situation. I felt bad for the guy. Then he does this to Molly to get back at me? Koblets and Miss Stepashin hit LA, they seek you out for representation, and your fee is, what, the usual 15%? Yeah. Well, uh... Well what? Well, I was forced to ask Gennady for 100,000 cash. I told him I could deliver a Golden Globe. See, Ykaterina's movie, The Guard Shack, had a little heat on it from the Azerbaijan Film Festival. Oh, Patrick. I'm in litigation on my screenplay, Megs. I owed $40,000 on those overcoats. The Golden Globe isn't for sale. (YELLING) I know that! Megs... It's not my best judgment call, I know. But I am doing pretty good at this. Don't tell Uncle Frank about the Golden Globe thing. Oh, Patrick. Pleasing Dad's the least of your problems right now. I've seen enough. Oh, Dennis. What, what? Hey, Dennis. I gotta make a call! ANGEL: That you Jimmy? Jimmy? Angel? Oh, God, Jimmy, I'm blind. (WAILING) I'm blind! You are not blind. I can't see. I can't see! Angel, you just have a minor concussion. They're keeping you overnight for observation. My eyesight's perfect, right? Now, don't lie to me, damn it! Angel, you were telling blind jokes, and now you're scared. Jimmy, do me a favor. Ask Mr. D if I still have the gig. Mr. D doesn't have a car any more. Oh, sure, same old Angel Martin luck! Now, what am I gonna do, huh? Plus, he owes me two days' pay. The girl's gonna live, Angel, just to put your mind at ease. How's the food here? She say? ROCKFORD: Boy, your cousin's areal piece of work, I'll tell ya. Just go on ahead, if you have to walk that fast. I worry about Patrick. I don't need for you to understand. ROCKFORD: Well, that's good, because I don't understand. Yeah, well, too bad. ROCKFORD: Up, Buddy, up. MEGAN: Buddy? Down boy. Down, Buddy, down. Let me ask you something. Was I right? Were you two kissing cousins more zany than I could guess? Do you know how ridiculous you sound? How I sound? Listen to you, rationalizing and babying a parasite like that. He wasn't always this way. Oh, big so what? After high school, Patrick was accepted at Harvard on a National Merit Scholarship, SATs in the high 15s. There's no shortage of fools at Harvard. Especially Harvard. Everything he achieved he did it all without a father. Oh, he had your dad. Yeah. He had my dad. Oh, hey. I'm sorry. This is really hard for me to talk about. It's all right. I should probably tell you. My parents owned a second house in Sun Valley. Look, if you don't want to talk about it, don't talk about it. And every holiday, there we were, my family, friends of my parents, the cousins, all kinds of friends and roommates from school. There was a separate guest house. Easter break in 1971. There'd been really great spring skiing. At this party, Patrick was there, I was there, my brothers and sisters, assorted boyfriends. I was going out with this guy named Tony Herndon. Get away from my girl, Patrick. I remember he had these little gold flecks in his eyes, and I thought that was so amazing. (MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Also, there was this guy, Jeff Kravitz, a friend of my brother's from Yale. Some people say Jeff Kravitz started it. It doesn't matter now. Freeze, oinky boy! (GUN CLICKING) (BOYS LAUGHING) BOY: Guys, put it away. (INAUDIBLE) (GUN CLICKING) (GUN CLICKING) (INAUDIBLE) (GUNSHOT) (INDISTINCT SCREAMING) So I always just say I lost my sight in a car accident. Otherwise, when people meet Patrick, or even in the way they relate to me... It's just a lot easier. June of that year, he made his first suicide attempt. I told him if he left me here like this, I'd kill myself. Which was probably stupid, but I was 15, and I couldn't think of any other way to stop him from hurting himself. My father... There's no way I can even begin to convey. But Patrick and I became even closer after that. I guess because we were both so isolated by everyone, you know. Each in our own way. Can you understand? Sure. So we are like lovers, I guess. It's like a private club of only two people. The Easter 1971 Club. (SOBBING) I'm sorry. Hey. Come on. I'm sorry. MEGAN: Boy, I slept great last night. I love this place. ROCKFORD: That would make Rocky happy. But I gotta find Koblets so we can all get on with our lives. (BIRDS CHIRPING) There's that same bird. You hear it? Every 17 seconds. (SINGING IN RUSSIAN) Oh, hey, Dennis. Man, I just get on days. Oh, I really appreciate this. How long you had this place staked out? Just long enough to find him, Dennis. I'm here to interview one of your customers. Police business. MAN: Yes, sir. Uh, I better get my manager. Mr. Koblets? Uh, Lieutenant Becker, police department. Mr. Koblets, Mr. Rockford here says that on Monday morning the 11th, you invaded his home in Malibu and proceeded to assault him. Is that true? You understand English, sir? I was to his home. You were? We talked. But assault? No, José. You tell him the truth, Koblets, or I'll... Hey. Hey, Jim... Just once, and you're out on the street. Mr. Koblets, Mr. Rockford also says that there was an individual with you wearing a Fila, a warm-up suit. The interrogation expert. Boris Andreyevitch? No. Ah, I'm sorry, Lieutenant, but I went alone to offer this man help in investigation. He left his card with old friend of mine, the maître d right here in this restaurant. Now I'm accused of assault? What assistance did you give him? Only moral support. I didn't know anything. (MEN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) Do you know a Molly Hiroki? (WOMAN COUGHING) Gentlemen, let me present Valeriana llovna Koblets. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) BECKER: Hello, ma'am. Uh, she doesn't speak English at all. But, boy, she enjoys her visit to LA. Molly Hiroki was sexually assaulted and beaten at her house on Thursday. Sexually assaulted? Where were you that afternoon? With my mother. BECKER: Where, with your mother? Disneyland. Where else? (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Pirate of the Caribbean. But this teacup ride on her stomach... (LAUGHS) She was undoubtedly out in the car with him when they came by my place. Maybe on their way to, uh, Knott's Berry Farm. She's gonna swear that there were no two other specialists. She was in the car. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) The department will be taking an active interest in you, sir. Did you tell Mother it's your wish to be buried at Frontierland? BECKER: Come on, Jim. ROCKFORD: All right, Dennis. I'm looking for Dr. Adams. Mmm-hmm. MEGAN: Hi. ROCKFORD: Hi. Well, here it is. Hey, this is very impressive. I'm very proud to be here. Let me just finish up some stuff. I thought maybe we'd go to Valentino's, my treat. Oh, well. Oh, I spoke with the children in Atlanta just now. Guess who went swimming. Oh, hey, that's great. Here, have a jelly bean. So, you think Koblets might actually decide to cool it, huh? Well... Oh! I was going to send that tape. He knows he's got some scrutiny on him. MEGAN: Or was Danny going to send it? What is going on here? What? You're running around speed-rapping like you're about to give birth to a pound of coffee. (EXHALES) (SIGHS) I spoke with Michael in Atlanta just now. The last couple of weeks, we've been talking about the possibility of getting back together. A lot of this has to do with the children, you know? I got it. Their situation isn't typical, you know. I said I got it. Oh, don't be like that. Like what? You're gonna do what you're gonna do. Uh, don't expect me to sit here and scrunch up my hankie over your children. They've got everything. And you know what? It is none of my business. It's just so complicated. And that's exactly what we agreed we didn't want. Oh, right. And you called me to compare notes. You're the one who got sexual. Oh? You complaining? Oh, please. Well, I'm glad I forced the issue. And the sex was great, by the way. (EXHALES) I don't feel like going out to dinner any more. I don't feel like going to the concert. Well, that's stupid. We have the tickets, they're hard to get. Ah, well. I don't see how we could have anything approaching a good time. Maybe your sister wants to go. Oh, Jim. (JIM SIGHS) Send me a Braves cap. (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Heel. That can't be my sister already. ROCKFORD: You stay back here. Oh, you're not gonna believe this. It's Patrick. (DOOR OPENING) Jim! Didn't Lieutenant Becker tell you to lay low? How low can you go? Meg, you nut, I used your Hide-a-Key. I hope you don't mind. Yes, I mind. You bust in here when everybody's all nervous and terrified. (MUSIC STOPS) Don't you ever think? I wanted to let you all know that Molly is doing much better. I was with her at the hospital all day. Well, that's good. PATRICK: And the situation with Koblets is, is pretty much resolved. I thought maybe we could all celebrate. Well, I know celebrate is not exactly the right word, considering the circumstances. Did Becker say everything was resolved? Well, he told me what he said to Gennady, and then I spoke with Gennady. What? Well, on the car phone, Megs. I said everything had gone beyond the pale. He agreed. And I made some assurances. He will never harm a follicle on the head of anyone I care about ever again. What did you say to him? Oh. The emotional Russian soul. It's, it's always complex dealing with them, but he's okay now. I, uh, got some things for Molly. Her favourite CDs, a nightie. Oh, Meg, I got something for you here. Here, here. It's the Chieftains. Long Black Veil. Sinead is on there, and Van the Man. It's a little Dougherty roots music. You mind if I listen to this later? No, it's... Sure. (PATRICK EXHALES) Look, uh, I know we had areal ugly situation, but we're alive, and, and life is always worth celebrating, right? Well, I mean, the situation is improved. I can understand how you'd like to see some prosecutions handed out. Way up there on my letter to Santa. I would just like to urge everybody to let things lie. What do you think? Are you leaving? Yeah. How come? Josie and I are going to a concert. Right. I'll call you. (DOOR CLOSES) COMMENTATOR ON TV: He's crossed pretty well this season. He's batting .328 against him. Bagley's waiting. And the 0-2 pitch... Slammed into the gap in right center! Foley's running over. Maggio's on second, crossing to third! He's coming around to score. He's being waved in, the ball comes in. The play's to home plate in time! Nailed him right... (CAR ALARM RINGING) Come with. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What about my golf clubs? (BORIS SPEAKING RUSSIAN) ROCKFORD: Those clubs cost me 1,000 bucks. Come on, guys. (BORIS SPEAKING RUSSIAN) (MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN OVER RADIO) (BORIS SPEAKING RUSSIAN) ROCKFORD: Somebody call the cops, would you? Somebody call the police! (BORIS SPEAKING RUSSIAN) ROCKFORD: Don't any of you people speak English? Put him in room. Lock the door. (STATIC BLARING) (ROCKFORD EXCLAIMING) Oh, hey! Hey! Hey! What do you want from me? (STATIC CONTINUES BLARING) (SCREAMING) Where am I? Megan. Megan, it's me, Jim! It's okay. Come here. There's a piano. It's a piano. This is white noise. In six to eight hours you cannot organize your thoughts or walk for a while. You can't do that to her. (STAMMERING) She can't even keep her balance if she can't hear. I know how you feel. That's why she's here. One of you will decide to help me. Help how? It is time now to stop delaying. We need Patrick. Well, Patrick said you and he resolved everything. Patrick is a very difficult man, and yet I'm fond of him. But, you know, he has his chemical dependencies and cannot be relied on. We don't know where Patrick squirrels off to. KOBLETS: / understand. In a few hours, I will for sure know what you know. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) (STATIC BLARING) ANGEL: Have a good day, now. Good luck to you, sir. That's right, everyone's a winner here, ma'am. Oh, you're not kidding! It's true. Rub my lucky spot, right here. Mr. Lucky, that's what they call me. Thanks for playing, ma'am. Oh, you're welcome. Hello, folks! How are ya? Uh, excuse me. Am I approaching the Montebello Public Library? This is a gambling casino. Oh, heck. Everybody wins! (STATIC BLARING) (INAUDIBLE) ROCKFORD: Hey, hey, I know that guy. MEGAN: What? ROCKFORD: He works at that Russian club. Hey. Hey! Hey! (VACUUM CLEANER WHIRRING) Remember me? El detectivo? (MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) (INAUDIBLE) (STATIC BLARING) Bring him to me. Bring him here. (INAUDIBLE) BOY 1: Do you need some help? Just keep moving, sonny. You're scaring my dog. Come on, baby. You were out here yesterday. Was I? Hey, how'd you lose your sight, mister? Bomb squad. BOY 1: Wow. It's okay, boy. Hey, that's not a real blind person's thing. BOY 2: Yeah, that harness dealie. It's the French version. Yeah, right. Suck your skate! Oh, bogus! BOY 3: Loser Yo, man. Nice wedgie! Oh, this dude's a fake! BOY 1: Hey. BOY 2: He's running, man! BOY 4: You better run, Jackson! (DOG BARKING) Woo! (STATIC BLARING) (MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) What is it? Be right back. Megan, stay there! FESTA: I want my 18 million, you son of a bitch! Oh, God. (BORIS SHOUTING IN RUSSIAN) (GUNSHOT) FESTA: Professor? MEGAN: Yes? What? (BORIS SHOUTING IN RUSSIAN) (GUNSHOTS) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) AUTOMATED VOICE: 2:00 a.m. Buddy? Buddy? Oh, good boy! Good boy! There you are! Such a good boy! (KEYBOARD CLACKING) AUTOMATED VOICE: Koblets, Gennady. Searching. Well, this thing is amazing. Yeah. It also has a scanner that can convert the printed page into speech, so I can read books. I'll be damned. AUTOMATED VOICE: Koblets, Gennady. Eleven files. MEGAN: Okay, now I can't skim this, so this thing's going to have to read all 11 of those files in their entirety. (AUTOMATED VOICE SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN) What's on the screen? Cyrillic type. What about now? AUTOMATED VOICE: English. Translating. ROCKFORD: Well, uh... Well, it's English. It looks like 11 titles. Uh, look like newspaper articles. MEGAN: Okay. You're going to have to skim it. Uh, "Interior Ministry Man Awarded..." That's 1981. "Officers Awaits... "Pair Released After Questioning in Death "of US Trade Representative." Enter eight. AUTOMATED VOICE: Eight. Enter. Moscow. Two former Interior Ministry officials were released after questioning in the hit-and-run death of Miles Melvoin, US trade representative. Melvoin died after attending a party at the home of Patrick Dougherty, President of Mos-wood Film Financing Consultants. Pause. ROCKFORD: "One of those questioned, Gennady I. Koblets "was also a guest, but had left earlier. "Koblets and Melvoin were known to have disagreed "on Mr. Koblets' alleged attempts "to divert American aid money." Now, this murder, your cousin must hold the smoking gun. Something that would get Koblets executed. Right. A major miscalculation. You don't blackmail a man like that. Patrick must have threatened him to make him leave us alone. (ROCKFORD EXHALES) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Hey, Dennis, this is a print-out off the Internet. I think you should look at it. I want to talk to you about your behavior the other night. Step into my office, please. What? Hello, Lieutenant. Over here. Here's a chair right here. Okay, thanks. Down, Buddy. ROCKFORD: Dennis. BECKER: Close the door. (DOOR CLOSING) Sean! You're coming back to the house, aren't you, Jim? I think I'll be heading home. Why? Maybe you can't handle any more of the party-hearty Doughertys. FRANK: All right. Thank you for coming, Jim. I'm truly sorry about the death of your cousin, Megan. Thank you. Good-bye. Bye, Josie. YOUNG JOSIE: Bye, Jim. Curb. What are you doing? Yearly maintenance. Thought I'd come out, maybe we'd have some lunch. What's your problem? I don't have a problem. I got the afternoon free, I'm offering to buy you lunch. You got to make a problem out of that? Thank you. Yeah, it's really cold out here. This Dougherty guy, real faccia brutta, huh? What do you think happened? Happened? Well, we find two plane tickets in the guy's pants. His girlfriend is on the way over, they're gonna meet, and they're gonna take off like a couple of free birds. So? LA is bigger than both our butts put together. Two Russians from Minsk, Pinsk, they just find a motel where Patrick is hiding out? Tell ya, that Megan Adams. One beautiful woman. It's over, Dennis. I figured. (EXHALES) She's getting married again. How about lunch? Let's do it. MAN ON TV: Shapes, sizes, and colors at unbeatable prices through this weekend only at all of our 16 locations. (RATTLING) So hurry... (TV TURNS OFF) You're gonna love it here. ROCKFORD: Angel! (DOG BARKING) Angel! (GUNSHOT) Ow! Oh, the skin's all scraped off! (ANGEL GROANING) Ow! Whose dog is that? I can't keep him, Jimmy. Not at my place. It's not fair to him. Oh, when did you start sharing your oxygen with another life form? (GROANS) I thought I would do a good deed, and I went to the pound, but I was only putting my own selfish concerns ahead of what's good for the animal. It's loneliness, Jimmy. Yeah, what was it, Angel? A seeing-eye scam? Jimmy... You're not dumping that dog on me, you got that? He's your dog, and you're gonna take care of him. If ever hear you gave him away, I am gonna feed you the rest of his Friskies, and then I'm gonna break your face! Okay, okay! Get in here. Get this dog some water. Okay, okay. Oh, and there's some almost-gone bologna in the fridge, too. Oh, you mean all the time I was working here, there was food rotting in there? And did I get any? No. Well, the only problem I can see is, uh, what's gonna happen to that dog if you get held in jail? What's that? If the cops choose to call it that, it's accessory to homicide. Accessory to my colon. What are you trying to lay on me? Well, you gave up Patrick Dougherty, didn't you? You drove him, knew his routine. Is he dead? Oh, I'm sure you can make a case that the Russians tortured you. Anyway, it's probably not a charge that you'd get indicted on. I didn't twist nobody's cap. You didn't point them to Patrick's motel? I haven't seen Mr. D since the accident. I've been in Garden a, man. I've been, I've been at the poker palaces trying to raise your 900. Oh, yeah, raise me my 900. Well, raise a pillow. You'd have come in for some. Look, Jimmy, that is what Larry is for. Frankly, I'm insulted that you would think that I might try to... Shut up, Angel. Stop it. FRANK: Come on, come on! You got to work it harder than that if you're gonna make that team at Harvard-West lake! Pull! Pull! Ah! You... You little... You! (YOUNG JOSIE LAUGHING) YOUNG JOSIE: No! (FRANK LAUGHING) Whoo! Whoo! No. Oh. (LAUGHS) I'm going up to the house to, to get my paper. YOUNG JOSIE: Okay. DANIEL: Marco! YOUNG JOSIE: Polo! FRANK: Jim! Frank. I'm sorry to startle you. The housekeeper let me in the front gate. No, it's all right. I, I don't think Megan is around right now, Jim. I think she went down to the beach with her sister. Oh, that's all right. I, uh... I don't want to talk to Megan yet. Oh? You all right? What is it? It has to do with your nephew's death. (FRANK SIGHS) You haven't been here. I have never seen her this bad, ever. Well, Patrick was the main character in the story of her life. Maybe it's finally having to accept the fact that it's not going to be rewritten. Ever. YOUNG JOSIE: Hey, Grandpa, come and watch me and Daniel jump. Did, uh, Megan ever express any anger at her cousin over the accident? No. No? No, I think she realized, even as a young girl, that her injury gave her the power to completely obliterate that kid, and I think it frightened her. Oh, she raged at other things. Therapists. Physical obstacles. Parents. Ah, it's to be expected. They'd been soul mates. Stayed that way. Don't ask me how. What about you? I was too harsh. I knew it even when I was doing it, but I couldn't stop myself. You saw it. Set him up, knock him down. You're very frank about it. YOUNG JOSIE: Grandpa, watch! That's my name, Jim. Did you tell Gennady Koblets where he might pick Patrick up? I mean, Patrick talked to you constantly. He craved your approval. You know, I like you well enough, Jim, but you better take down that social worker shingle or you could be facing a lawsuit. This girl that he loved and hurt so badly, she couldn't give him what he had coming to him. Patrick hated himself, Frank. (SCOFFS) (CHUCKLES) You know my other children, when their when their kids' school pictures turn out badly, they go into a tailspin. She has never seen her daughter's face. Her son's. MEGAN: Daddy. Is he right? Why don't you answer me? Oh, Daddy. How long could we go on? He was so unhappy. So tortured. Holy God, Dad. Oh, my God. You were his father. The job fell to you. Why me? No, that's the wrong question. All you can do is keep going and carry what you have to carry. But you didn't. You didn't, Daddy. You taught all of us to do that, and in the end, you didn't. Megan. You and Mom dragged me kicking and screaming from my room. You made me want to succeed and have a life. And now I can never speak to you again, never see you again. Hey, Grandpa, check it out! (IMITATES GUNSHOT) Megan, what the hell are you saying? How can 1? How can I let my children be around your influence now? Megan, you Kids, and your children, you're everything to me. You know that. Was I such a disappointment? Such a horrible tragedy to you that you had to murder? Because I don't feel like that, Daddy. I don't feel like I'm a tragedy. (INDISTINCT POLICE CHATTER OVER RADIO) (TIRES SCREECHING) Your boss is inside. He kicked me out. Well, I'm aware of that. Frank Dougherty told you he met with the Russian here? No, they called him from here. He didn't set up the killing, he just told them what they needed to know. Captain, are you with the manager? McENROE: Roger that. What've we got? A Boris "A" for Andreyevitch Makshinov is registered. Let's do it, sir. McENROE: Roger. What do you think you're doing? Well, Dennis, ... Stay! OFFICER : Gentlemen, I want to clear this area, please. Stand back. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Please, stand back. He's taking a schvitz. I'll head back to Division, all right? I want to check with the Russian Consulate. Folks, clear the hallway, please. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Mr. Makshinov? (WOMAN SCREAMS) (GUNSHOTS) OFFICER 1: Police! Freeze! Drop the weapon! Drop it! Put your hands on your head! Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon! Drop it, I said! Drop it! OFFICER 2: All right, ma'am, it's all over, it's okay. Out of the pool! Out of the pool now! (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) On your face. On your face! Where's Gennady Koblets? (WHISTLES) (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Uh, that's Moscow. I got it! Everybody fan out and search the surrounding properties. I'll stay here with the suspect. Move it. Mr. Rockford. Get up. Not only have you used methods of torture against several citizens, including a visually-impaired woman, but just now you assaulted Mr. Rockford over a minor altercation concerning your shower sandals. What? What? What? Where's you hypodermic needle now, huh? This is your chance to escape. (GRUNTING) Well, don't quit on me now. You're doing real good. Let me show you this one. We have a search in progress. Yes, sir. (BORIS GROANING) (WATER SPLASHING) (PHONE RINGING) (GRUNTS) Hello? (DIAL TONE) (PHONE RINGING) ANSWERING MACHINE: This is Jim Rockford. At the tone, leave your name and message. I'll get back to you. MEGAN: it's me. That was me who hung up. (SIGHS) I'm not going to Atlanta. I'm confused. Probably not thinking clearly right now. I need to pull myself together and, and talk to somebody. (SIGHS) I need to talk to you, so, okay, call me if you want to. Bye.
