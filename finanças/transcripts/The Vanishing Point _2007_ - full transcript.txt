OK. Transparent in front, blue card behind. In what name? They're to be bound for noon. Take the money. 1,80 euro. Thanks. Your receipt! Have a nice day. You don't eat that with milk? No. So you don't put weight on. I had none left. Can we look at the picture? What is it? #The Shop-Sign of Gersaint. Watteau's last painting. Can we get better background definition? We should be able to. You can't extrapolate with this machine. Wait for a new one. But we can do this bit, can't we? Patience. Lucie Audibert. From 1709 to 1712, we don't know much about Watteau. Watteau is 27,well-known, almost famous, but strange, instable... No notes, please. Go straight to the point. During this period, he sketched from life. We often see this woman's back. She inspired many of his works. No one knows who this woman was. Maybe an actress, a servant... We don't know. Watteau sketched this woman from here in the Com?die Fran?aise, later transferring her to gardens or forests. And Caylus? Sorry? What do you do about Caylus? Caylus? He believed Watteau had several studios in Paris where his model posed for him. Caylus is a dickhead! Shall I continue? Yes, present your other elements. In some paintings, like this one, the vanishing point converges on her. Everything's structured around her. This is maybe the woman. #Jupiter and Antiope, an unusual canvas for Watteau. It is overtly erotic. He wanted the canvas burnt. What bothered him so that he wanted it destroyed? If I understand correctly, you're saying Watteau was a voyeur. A kind of Hannibal Lecter of gallant painting. What's stopping me from using a photo of a passer-by? Watteau could've sketched someone in the street, later reproducing her as much as he wanted. The only way of confirming that is with his sketchbooks, of which 90% have been lost. Any more specific elements? No. Whose turn is it now? Mine. Alexandre Calon is going to talk to us about Boucher. Please do your best to be precise. An idiot. I looked such an idiot. Miss... I'll see you. Why did you choose that particular subject? I don't know. And why choose me as your supervisor? I was advised. By whom? By students. I'm not at the university this week. Come to this address on Thursday at 6 pm. There will be time. Hi, Herv?. What are you having? A coffee. Oh, you're here. The way you say that, it's as if I've come from Mars. I never see you coming, or going for that matter. Depends where you're looking. It's so hot! Are you in trouble? Money problems? My rent. Again! Sort yourself out. I can't keep coughing up. Then I'll be kicked out. That's too easy. Get yourself a job! I've been working for 3 months. Sell some of your stuff, clothes. Clothes! The watch... Dad's? How much? Five cents. I'll see what I can do. What a beautiful morning! It's our morning. No. Why wait? One must know how to wait, my friend. Hello. How have you been keeping? I can't go to Montreal without seeing something. No, tell them to send me the file. I only travel after having seen a work. Goodbye, Suzanne. #The clafoutis is in the microwave. #Isabelle Take a seat, please. What do you see? The "Gilles" from the Louvre. But more simply put? It's thought to be the actor Pierre La Thorilli?re. No. What do you see? Be elementary. I see a Pierrot stood facing me. What else? It's like he's dressed up as a Pierrot. What makes you say that? His eyes tell me. What else? His hands. And? The eye. Which eye? The donkey's. It's also dressed in a costume. A donkey costume. And why? Because that eye has such... Such? Such humanity. Humanity. We're getting there. Why is it so sad? You tell me. No one listens to it. It's all alone. Whose is the eye that sees only us, Lucie? It's the painter's eye. The donkey sees everything and is unseen. OK, Mr. Boitard. I'll have the cheque next week. Yes, I promise. Have we met? You're miming? You lip-read, mister? #Drop the "mister". I don't understand. I don't understand. There's a snake? A river? A river in the square? The River Bi?vre. Why, what's up? Well, he's weird. You didn't take him home? Why not? You'll end up in a plastic bag in a car boot. Is he handsome? He's got lovely eyes. Really! A deaf-and-dumb street performer... It could only happen to you! Why was the child removed? Family affairs. He was illegitimate. That, or he went mad, homosexual, handicapped, or he ruined the family. He's like a ghost. He was painted over. Some are wiped off, rubbed out, altered or slashed out. He showed you a card? A card? A deaf-and-dumb card. Where's your bitch's card? What could come my way, Garance? Where are you up to? Fernand, Lucie. Hello. - Hello. She's also with Dussart. I haven't seen him in ages. What are you working on? Watteau. Watteau, with Dussart? Yes. Why? And your subject? Women in Watteau's works. He's your best 18th century man, no doubt about it. Miss, we're closing. OK. Alice Mangeot played Pascaline. Suzanne Dornon: Lucienne. Charlotte Desmares: the woman with a feather. We're closing. I heard. Charlotte Desmares was charming, an idolized actress, a Parisian darling. Born in Copenhagen, her godfather was the king of Denmark. I think the woman with a feather is Charlotte Desmares. That's the same costume she wore in Dancourt's play "The 3 Cousins." We see the exact same costume in"Isle of Cythera." You started to see and you've become blind again. #Watteau, The Theatrical Lead #By Jean Dussart, October 1982 That was 25 years ago. I got it out for you. You can keep it. Put these on and take it. Those are marks from the seams. It's from a sketchbook of models, sought after for the past 50 years. They'd be proof that Watteau drew Charlotte at the theatre, and that he loved her. I went all over Europe looking for them. I invested my own money. I borrowed... And nothing. Put her out of your mind. Why do you always get me to come here? Shall we go? Come on, let's dance! I can't undo it. My head's spinning. #Annabelle Roy, a remarkable theatre actress... #Alpinist Alain Audibert disappears #A second attempt at climbing K2... #Buried by snow, #his body was never found. You pick your days. Sorry. On delivery day! Trim the paper then sort the boxes. 40, 50, 3... and 2 make 5. Have a nice day. Can you come here? I don't understand. Oh, right. That's ten. Have a nice day. What the hell's the matter? Look how it's cut! Sorry. And it's for Belloto. Who's Belloto? My best customer! He's coming at noon. Party only if you can work the next day. 400 cards, damn it! Sort out the boxes. Vincent! Vincent! What happened? What happened? An aneurism. It can happen at anytime. And what now? We'll reduce medication to see if he wakes up. I'll leave you alone with him. #Call me. Here are your pictures. Ivan #Pierre Valadier Institute,1978 #Pierre Valadier Institute I'm an Art History researcher. I'd like information on one of the Institute's paintings. #Which painting? It was in the great hall. #The painting of the actors, by Openor. By who? #Openor. Where is it now? #When the state took over, #Mr. Valadier's family #retrieved everything of any value. OK. His workshops were near the Com?die Fran?aise. "The Fool", the Louvre collection. Have we got anywhere? Show me those. I haven't finished. There's no point yet. Let me decide. Come on, don't be silly. You'll only say it's useless. "The Fool" in the "Shop-Sign" is a painting by Openor. That's Watteau at 27. And that is a sketch by Openor. It's the only work with both Openor and Watteau. Look at the likeness. Openor was little-known, he spent his time at the theatre. Watteau was well-known but shy. Openor introduced him to Charlotte in the theatre. What a tale! The paintings in the "Shop-Sign" are by masters Watteau admired. What's a canvas by Openor doing there? It's just proof Gersaint had an Openor in his shop. There's no secret love story. All of that only exists in your mind, and you're losing it. If I've nothing in a week I'll stop. No. I promise. Why do you put me down? You let your emotions take over. That's not good? No, not for a researcher. It's not worth it? for your private life, not for your work. Hello. Hello. How is he? We've stopped the medicine but he's not woke up. You're the only visitor. He has no parents? We never discussed that. Hold his hand or he won't know you're here. You think he feels that? Skin-to-skin contact is vital. Human touch gets through to them. Bring some of his things in. Objects? Yes, he must have some at home. I don't have his keys. We'll sort something out with admin. #The River Bi?vre You'll close up? Yes. You're working late? No. Lucie, I just wanted to ask... With the customers, can you try to be a bit more... More what? How can I say it? Pleasant. A bit more with it. How's Vincent? A coma's not like having a cold. I'm not good at this, but if you want to talk... #Com?die Fran?aise Former Hotel of the King's Actors What's the matter? Are you ill? No, I just went to bed late. I must talk to you. Now? Why haven't I heard from you? I've not seen you in weeks. I've had problems. Come in. What do you want? I'm worried about you. You've come to see how I'm doing? You are an arrogant lady, Miss Audibert. Arrogant. You just want to see if I've found something. Because you failed! I have not failed! I lost my wife because of my research. She met another man. She was tired of waiting. She died shortly after in an accident. Don't continue. Shit. Watteau's friend, Crozat, had a country house in Montmorency. They spent their afternoons under the porch. The porch had 3 arches, and on each one figured a lion stifled by Love. Openor. What are you doing here? You must let us know when you come. Visiting hours finish at 7:30 pm. It's intensive care, not a train station. Malika! Room 5. Take him back in. Come in. Hello. Can I see you a minute? Certainly not. Call the secretary for an appointment. Let's resume. Vacation time's exploded during the first semester. No one's going to catch time up in the second. Just a minute. What is it? I need your signature to consult the X-rays. Impossible, I'm in a meeting. It'll only take a second. I'm asking you to leave. You're refusing? You had time enough the other day at my door. That's enough. Help me. It's too late. Help me, damn it! I no longer sustain your work. Get out. You're not disturbing me. Don't touch me! Kindly leave, miss. Leave, please! Calm down now. There we go. Shit! My phone. Pick it up. She's crazy! You're not right. #Mr. Valadier died 6 months ago. #Everything went in the settlement. #Everything was sold. Sold? #Maybe the Lille court can help. The Lille court! Hello, Mr. Duez. The court gave me your number. You recently bought an Openor. #That's correct. You still have it? #Yes, but not for long. Meaning? #It's going on auction. Where? #Ghent, in Belgium. In Ghent! #Lots of items are sold there. 5,000 euros. Shit! Good morning, miss. What's happened here? I had friends round, it's messy. Messy? It's a wreck! I have a train to catch. You don't answer the phone. My battery's flat. I'm sick of this. I'm warning you, the rent by the end of the week or I'll start procedures. I've got it, thank you. Oh, it's you! I thought it was Jacques. We argued. What's that? Nothing. An allergy. See a doctor. It'll go. Why are you here? No reason. There's always a reason. You've never even come to see me play. You hate it when we watch. Who's "we"? Who's "we"? When I came with dad... Still him. Don't hold my head. You've got a temperature. Why are you here? Tell me. Come on, tell me. Can you lend me 5,000 euros? A dress, then? Why, of course. You have a sale certificate or some kind of receipt? It's from my family. Well, some ID? Sure. It's a lovely item. I can give you 8,000 euros. 8,000? But it's unique. I know, but... It's worth 10,000. Go see a colleague... But I've a generous reputation. But can I have cash? It shouldn't be a problem. And we turn now to this small Painting Openor, painting theatre. painting between 1709 and 1714... We start the bidding Since 5000 euros From... At five thousand five hundred Amex, MasterCard or Visa? Cash. It's 8,400. Visa? It's the wrong pin number. Could you sign? Thank you. Goodbye. Garance. Lucie? Can we talk? Come on up. Not in the workshop. It's personal. No, I'm alone. Give me that. Wow, you're... Hang on, what is this? Will you do it? You have an X-ray? I can't just go at it. Examine it. Please. I must ask Gasque. No! Hold on. Calm down! Stop staring. You're giving me the jitters. You've met Garance? Hello. There it is. What do you think? It's disturbing, isn't it? What do you make of it? It's a Watteau. An original. Where did you find it? Watteau loved Charlotte Desmares. His studio overlooked the theatre's dressing rooms. He started drawing her on stage, to flatter her. It must've turned sour. Maybe he considered burning the paintings. He repainted them crudely and signed a false name. Openor. Charlotte's face disappeared. The sketchbooks vanished, taking all traces of his love. She became# the hidden lady. I realized Openor didn't exist at Montmorency. Watteau signed using the name he saw engraved on Crozat's portico. The inscription's reference is in your notes. The inscription's still there, under a lion stifled by Love. He had an embolism two days ago. I phoned but there was no answer. I'm so sorry. Can I see him? Nobody claimed the body. He was buried. Damn it! Subtitles by LeapinLar
