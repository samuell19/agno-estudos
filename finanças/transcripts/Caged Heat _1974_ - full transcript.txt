- [Man] Hi. Let me talk to you about it. Slumberland Eternal. When it's time to lay down and die, we got just the place for ya, and we got just the box to put you in. We go from the copper burnish model all the way down to the pine box, the ol' pine box. Two boys on a rollerskate drag you out the door. There are two locations. Slumberland, on the east side of town, 126th and Vernon, but with revolving blue headlight, and across town, at 126th and East Vernon, Slumberland Two. [grunts] Time for the big D, it happens to us all. - Hold it right there! [gun fires] God damnit, you're busted! [guns fire] - Come on! [screams] [gun fires] - Come on! - Hold it!

[Jackie yelps] - [Man] You will be transported from here to Conorville Correctional Institute for Women. You are an accessory to the grievous bodily assault of a police officer, a particularly foul offense. For your refusal to reveal the names of your partners in crime, I feel no regret in sentencing you to a term of no less than 10, nor more than 40 years for possession of dangerous drugs and accessory to attempted murder. [footsteps clack] [light crackles] [dark organ music] [woman moans] [woman moans] [woman and man moan] [man moans] [man moans] [woman screams and giggles] [man moans] [alarm buzzes] - Cell Block 11, Nell Hall, Amboso. Trundi, Tacaridge. [moody guitar music] [background chatter] - And dress and cook for days. - Oh, a little bobo, wow, I gotta get outta here. - Fine hotels. - Uh-huh. So this salesman dips into this train station men's room, and he sees this machine on the wall. Handy Dandy Wife Away From Home. You know, there was a big round hole. Puts the dime in, pulls out his john hancock. Sticks his john hancock in the hole. [imitates buzzing and grinding] Grabs his thing, he pulls it out, and there's a button sewn on the end! - Oh, come on. [acoustic blues music] - Yeah, Charlie? Yeah, Bif's here with the new arrivals, gate one. Yeah, comin' in now. Just goin' around the hill. Yeah, here they come, they're comin' into the compound. Okay, buddy, they're all yours. - [PA System] Dr. Randolph. Dr. Randolph. Please report to clinic for in-processing new arrivals. - Okay, ladies, move it. Come on, we haven't got all day. Oh, let's go, let's go, come on. [Randolph hums melodically] - All right, ladies. Please remove all articles. On the other side of the line, please. Please remove all articles of clothing at this time. And this is your last opportunity to surrender any, uh, concealed narcotics, drugs or weapons on your person. - What's next? - You'd be surprised at the foreign objects we find hidden inside new arrivals. - [Prisoner] Yeah, I would be. - Listen, I don't enjoy this ritual any more than you do. Now what we're going to do now is some calisthenics. I'd like you girls to help me. We're going to start off with deep knee bends for openers. [prisoner spits] [prisoner groans] - If I ever get out of this hole, I'm gonna write my life's story, all men are shit. - Yeah, I could write a few chapters myself. - How long are you in for, as a matter of fact? - Who, us? We're really reporters disguised as prisoners. We're going for the Pulitzer Prize. As a matter of fact, we don't ask questions like that around here. - What's your name, Miss Pretty? - Jacqueline Wilson. - Hi, Jackie, I'm Belle and this is Pandora. - It is so claustrophobic in here. - [Pandora] You better work on that. You don't wanna wind up like Bonnie over there. Bonnie, she had claustrophobia. Used to scream and shout every time they lock her in a cell. - Yeah, it was really terrible. She made such a nuisance out of herself, they finally took her over to the clinic. - What'd they do to her there? - Don't know. But she doesn't scream and shout anymore. Come on, baby, come on. [moans] I know I could do it, come on! Do it! Snake eyes! [moody string music] - What do you wanna do now? - Anything is good. - [Woman] Why don't you do your own little thing, and I'll do my own little thing? - They really expect us to wear these things? - [Woman] Hey, I don't care what you wear, lady. Just stay away from me. - Oh, terrific, you and me are really gonna get along great. We're gonna have a lot of fun. - God damnit! Who copped my smokes? [tense string music] Where are they? [prisoner laughs] - I'm sorry, Maggie. - You stinkin' clepto! You don't even smoke! [slap] - She's had enough, Mag, she can't help herself. She's sick that way. - Oh, really? [alarm buzzes] Yeah, all right. She's had enough this time. [moody string music] But if she rips me off just one more time, I'm gonna spill a can of kick-ass all over her butt. [dog barks] [dog howls] - [Woman] Please help me. [Jackie moans] [suspenseful music] - [Man] Over here! [Jackie grunts] - Shh. - Help me! - You're busted. [grunts] Breathe! - [Woman] Please help me. - [Man] Hold it, you're busted. Hold it. - Please. - Over here. Breathe. - You're busted. - Hold it, buddy. Hold it! Hold it. [Jackie screams] [prisoners scream over each other] - [Woman] Hey, you girls, stop that damn noise! - Get down and shut up! - I know who you are! - [Woman] I'm gonna kill you, if you don't shut up! - [Woman] Jesus, why is everybody screaming? What's going on? - Shh! - [Woman] Oh, come on, you guys, look-- - [Woman] Everybody shut up, damnit! - [Woman] Will everybody stop screaming, please? I wanna go to sleep. - [Woman] Stop screaming! - Cops chasing Pinocchio through the woods, hauling his little wooden ass. He sees Cinderella in the clearing, and he jumps under her dress. "Wow, what a hideout." The pigs run right by them. Cinderella, she says to Pinocchio, "tell me, is it true "that your nose grows each time you tell a lie, Pinocchio?" Pinocchio says, from beneath the dress, "Sure is, Cinderella." "Tell a lie, Pinocchio." He does. "Now the truth." And he does. "Now a lie. "Truth. "Lie, lie, lie! "Lie!" - My rap is assault with a deadly weapon. I went after some bastard with a broken bottle. - Did you-- - Kill him? No. I cut his balls off instead. - You did? - Didn't need the mothers anyway. - Wow. - Hey. What kinda girl do you think I am anyway? [lively chatter] [harmonica music] - [Guard] Let's go, hurry up, come on, move it! - Let me in. [scattered applause] - [Woman] Oh, Doctor, my temperature is risin'! [percussive music] [prisoners whistle and hoot] ♪ Oh, when the saints go marchin' in ♪ ♪ I just want to be in that number ♪ ♪ When the saints go marchin' in ♪ [prisoners cheer and applaud] - Oh, hello, Phil! How are you tonight? - Unbelievable, George. I feel just like a buttoned cuck. [prisoners cheer] - He looks more like a quarrelsome pecker to me. [prisoners cheer] [percussive music] [prisoners cheer and applaud] - [Woman] Oh, shake it! [slide whistle] - Hey, Phil? - Yeah, George? - Just saw that pussycat of yours runnin' round like crazy. Up fire escapes, down alleys and into basements. What's happenin', baby? - You know, George, I just had that cat de-balled and now he's out breakin' in cages! [prisoners laugh] - Speakin' of sex, Phil. - Who was speakin' of sex, George? - [Pandora] I vow to say that I've never had sex with my wife until after we married. - [Belle] That right, George? - What about you? - Don't know, George. What was your wife's name? [prisoners laugh] - Hey, Phil! What's a good gift for a girl who has everything? - [Belle] Everything? - Everything. - Say, that's easy, silly. Penicillin! [doctor laughs] [scattered applause] [prisoner cheer and applaud] [percussive music] [prisoners laugh] - Enter, Jeeves. - Breakfast, m'lord? - Thank you, Jeeves. [slide whistle] [prisoners laugh] - Oh, my lord! [prisoners laugh] [yells] - Better we wear baggy trousers! I'm going to smuggle this to the city. [prisoners laugh] [prisoners laugh and cheer] Some climax. [somber string music] [superintendent sighs] - [Prisoners] Yeah! - Don't you realize it was sex that put you behind bars in the first place? - [Prisoners] Yeah! - Stealing to dress better for a man. Fornicating. Packing the pockets of women using pimps. Killing to eliminate a sexual rival! - [Prisoners] Yeah! - Give me contrition! - [Prisoners] Contrition! - Let's have redemption! - [Prisoners] Redemption! - Repentance, repentance! - [Prisoners] Repentance! - Of one's debt to society! - [Prisoners] Of one's debt to society! [prisoner cheer and applaud] - That show of yours last night was positively disgusting. [sighs] Given the chance to express yourselves, you went straight to the gutter. Even for criminals, you're just a particularly poor reflection on womanhood. - The others seemed to dig it. - Exactly, which of you was responsible for the contents of that exhibition? - I beg your pardon? - This pornography seems to suggest that you might be the creator, Williams. - [Pandora] Where did you get this? - Found in a routine search of your cell this morning, and I don't like the hostility you're projecting, Williams. - You got real problems, superintendent. - I'm afraid yours are just beginning. I think a couple of days in solitary on a minimal diet will give you time to think this over, Williams. We'll rap about this later. - Rap, my ass. [superintendent chuckles] - You know, I had the strangest... Most disturbing dream last night. Disturbing, but... Oddly gratifying. [chuckles] - Pig. - Yeah. [door slams and locks] [heartbeat thuds] - Come on, come on, come on, let's hurry up! Come on, get goin'. [water splashes] All right, it's ready, come in!

They can't put Pandora in lockup just for havin' a picture of her boyfriend, can they? - Things you shouldn't be leaving around here. - Five, six, seven, eight. - Someone ought to speak to the warden, I mean, Pandora's got her rights, doesn't she? - Not around here, McQueen's boss. - Well, well, what have we here? A little social worker right here in Conorville. Listen! Take care of yourself and don't stir it up with McQueen! - 450. 451. [gasps] 453. 454. 455. 456. - You got me, sister? - Look, I'm not bothering you, so just get off my case! - I'm not on it yet, but you 'bout to get it, baby. [woman yelps] [tense music] I'll knock your pretty little teeth so far down your throat you're gonna get a picket fence round your asshole. [thuds and grunts] [women yell over each other] I, uh, slipped. - Same here. - Oh, you slipped, too? There's one thing you better learn, uh, Wilson, Jacqueline, before you find yourself assigned for CPT. - CPT? - Corrective Physical Therapy. We have a violent sorority here, and very strong ways of dealing with it. - Is putting Pandora Williams in solitary confinement supposed to correct her? - No, we punish here, as well as correct. I see that maybe you're begging for another demonstration? - Look, superintendent-- - You look, Wilson, Jacqueline. I've seen your file, I know that both your parents are dead, but you come from a good family. Now, toe the line and avoid trouble like the plague. You're in a house of desperate women here, and a long, long way from home. [moody string music] - You might as well know. I don't care. I was hitchhiking with a friend from back east. About six months ago. I stabbed a guy. He was raping my friend. Died, son of a bitch. - Lavelle, how long you in for? - The guy's father was a senator or somethin'. I got first-degree murder. I'm in for life. [bell rings] [alarm buzzes] - [Guard] Jays, Judy Asiphus Estrollos. Wilson, Cromwell, Henry, Jude. Report to kitchen after showers. All others, agricultural therapy.

Pandora, can you hear me? 170, 169. - Pandora? - [Belle] 168, 167. - Belle? - 166, 165. - What? - 164. - How long I been in here? - 163, 162, 161, 160. I'll be back. 159, 158, 157. 122, 121, 120. - Okay, girls, fun time's all over, let's get lined up. In the back, please. [suspenseful music] - Do you see Belle? - [Belle] 18, 17, 16. - 17, 18, 19. There's gotta be 20. - It was just one of those mornings. [toilet flushes] - Needed some salt. [thud] [tense music] Get it off. Get it off! - Say, can you read lips? - What? - You son of a-- - Misha! [gun fires] [guard groans] - [Jackie] Maggie! - Are you coming with us? - What about her? - Screw her! And you too, then! Jesus. This could be the start of something big. [glass shatters] [Jackie yelps] [guard moans] [glass shatters] [guard moans] [gun fires rapidly] [Jackie grunts] [gun fires] [prisoner groans] [knife clangs] [Jackie grunts] - Rebellion. Rebellion. Assault on prison personnel. [sighs] And destruction of Federal property. C-P-T! - [Guard] You're next. - Could I see McQueen, please? - Sure, come on.

The warden, where is she? I wanna see McQueen! Hey, man, you are fucking crazy, I mean, look at me! Look at me, would you look at me? You're crazy, this is rape. - Relax yourself. - I wanna talk to McQueen. You can't do this to me. [machine buzzes] [grunts and screams] No, please, no! No! Please, I won't hurt anyone anymore. I promise you, I won't hurt anyone, please, please! [machine buzzes] [screams] Don't hurt me anymore, okay?

Man, that shit's been outlawed. They ain't lightin' me up like a fuckin' Christmas tree no more! I'm gettin' outta here if it fucking kills me! - Wilson. Wilson. Hey. Are you all right? Hey, you're actin' just like Bonnie did. Wilson. Sweetheart, it's gonna be all right. Believe me, everything's gonna be cool. Super cool. Hey, you know what we're gonna be doin' next week? Pandora, you and me, we're gonna be drinkin' champagne, eatin' caviar, with a room full of men like you wouldn't believe. Well isn't that better than being six-feet-under with a bunch of loners? - Attention, attention! Lights out in one minute. Back to your units. - Okay, say hi to the worms for me. - [Guard] Lockup! - Belle, you're crazy. - Yeah, I know, just crazy enough to get outta here. [Jackie sobs] Are you with us, Wilson?

I'm gettin' a little hot and I gotta stay out here all day. Come on, why not, huh? Be gone like 15 minutes. We'll go behind the tree, the prisoners ain't gonna see. - Tree? The tree?

[horn honks] - Hurry it up, would ya? - Hey, take it easy, eh? - So, I decided to be just like the toughest person I know. Jack, [chuckles] that railroaded me in the first place. [horn honks] God damnit, what you doin' down there, makin' it? - Look, lady, you wanna do this? - Sounds like quite a guy. - We robbed a million banks together. [chuckles] Never the same city twice. Iowa, New Orleans. All the little country towns in-between. Oh, it's easy if you've got a gun, and you know how to move fast. Yeah, we really had it down. I never got caught. Except once. Thanks to that pair of balls, Jack. Holy shit. - Hey, punk, where's your john? - Right around the corner. Just follow your snout. - Smart ass punk. [dogs bark] [suspenseful music] Hey! Hey, where's my car? - What're you talkin' about? - Where's my car, god damnit! - What're you talkin' about? I don't see no car, how do I know you had a car? Hey, buddy, you're crazy! Wait a minute! - Heads are gonna bust around here. - Shit. - [Guard] Come on, out! - Shit. [Randolph hums melodically] [Randolph hums melodically] - Why do I do these things?

Crazy Alice! - Maggie! Maggie, outta sight, oh, wow! When did you get out? - Oh, right now, how the hell are ya? This is Wilson, she's a little strange, but she's cool. This is Crazy and she needs to use the phone. - [Crazy] Sure, it's right down here. - What is with this nonsense? - Oh, I got laid off at the plant, what're you gonna do? - What do ya gotta do? - What're you gonna do? - Damnit, wrong woman. - Sparky, I got ya. Listen, it's Wilson, I need Jake and I need some IDs. - Oh, shit, and Billie? - [chuckles] Busted. - Frank? - Dead. - No, Sparky, he can't be dead. - Killin' it. - You're under arrest on suspicion of soliciting and prostitution. Anything you wish to say may be held against you. - That is an insult! - Anything you wish to say may be held against you! And that goes for you too, sweetheart. - Fuck you say, buddy, I ain't going anywhere with you. [officer groans] - Come on, Crazy! - [Officer] Get off! [groans] [groans] - Holy shit! This is it for me, I'm out on double-parole already. - Bullshit, Crazy, don't you know someplace we can hide out? - My sister's place. - Are they cool? - Are you kiddin', she's crazier than me. - Okay. Get more than you bargained for, sweetheart? - You know, Doctor, there are so many things about modern technology that I don't understand. Things that must be crystal clear to a man of science like yourself. Rockets to the Moon. Correcting human behavior with drugs and surgery. I don't know, perhaps I'm just old-fashioned. That thing's not on, is it? An inmate murders a kitchen matron. As much a tragedy for the inmate as it is for the old lady. And for me too, because you see, [chuckles] I am responsible for both of them. Can you assure me that, uh, this operation of yours will radically guarantee that this girl's capacity for violence will be completely absolved? - Killing that helpless old woman. - Forever. With a single twist of the grill, you've seen the mellowing effect it's had on flowers, Bonnie. - Well, then. So be it. Oh, you'll make sure, of course, that she'll sign the voluntary release? - Oh, yes, of course. - Thank you, Doctor. - [sighs] I hate to mention it. - The escapees? Don't worry. They'll be back. - This is the life. Is this the life? - The life. - Hey, did you check the look on that badger's face when Wilson got him right between the legs? Oh, it was beautiful. - What you gonna do now, Wilson? - I don't know. - Would you like to make some dollars? Alice has a tip on some easy. - It could be illegal, huh. - [Jackie] Yeah, I could use some money. - You know that friend of yours, Sparky. Could he get us some guns and a good set of wheels? - He says he can get anything. - Then get him on the phone. - Well, let's call him up. [slap] - Belle Tyson. Do you want a shot at parole? Do you want to get out of prison? - I do. - I want you to sign a form that will permit me to do some work on you, to satisfy me. That it's okay for you to be paroled, that you're not a menace to the community, is it a deal? You don't wanna kill again, do you? Is it a deal, Belle? - Uh-huh. - By god, you won't regret this. - Now, your conduct's been good, prior to the incident at the grove. I don't know, maybe it was the negative influence of your cellmate that made you break your pattern. - Maybe it was. - Yes, you could be eligible for parole in eight or 10 years if you keep your record clean. Now, I've put a temporary hold on your corrective therapy. And I've given you a job at the clinic. So, make the most of it, keep your eyes open, and learn. [Belle moans] - We'll have you better real soon, just leave it up to me. Just leave it up to me. Fine. [door slams] [door slams] [camera snaps] [camera snaps] [Belle moans] [Lavelle gasps] [camera snaps] [dark atmospheric music] [camera snaps] [Randolph sobs] [Randolph sobs] [percussive music] - [Robber] Up against the wall, lady! Move, move! - I don't believe it! - I do. - [Robber] Hurry it up! Don't even wiggle that that fine ass of yours! Get that cash in those sacks. [gun fires] [alarm rings] [guard coughs] [driver mumbles] - Oh, mister, please. Think I'm gonna faint if I can't have a cigarette. - So, faint! - Oh, please! - [Robber] Fire one up, Dave. [gun fires] - You! - Okay, buckaroo, get 'em up and I do mean your hands! - Oh, babe. - Hurry up with those bags! [siren wails] [tires screech] - Okay, buddy, get moving. - Here's lookin' at you, babe. - Right, move. - Come on! - Hold it! - You too, Donald. [guns fire rapidly] [Donald groans] [gun fires] [gun fires] [tires screech] [tires screech] Bye bye, now! [percussive music] - Psycho surgery? You mean, when they, uh, cut off a piece of a person's brain to, um-- - Curb the flow of violent tendencies in the individual, by eliminating their abilities to maintain that violent thought for any length of time. - Yeah. What about their other thoughts? Pandora? It's about Belle. - What about Belle? - Well, it's none of my business, but they're doing really weird things to her. - Spit it out, girl. - The doctor, he's, he's crazy. - They must've given you one jolt too many in there, sister. You're in a dangerous frame of mind. - I've gotta go back for them. - That's your problem! I'm not putting my ass in the sling for them. - I'll pay good money for your help. I've got a fool-proof plan. - You've got an impossible fuckin' dream, toots. Crazy? - Well, it's never been done before and that's bad. - [Maggie] Right. - But they won't be expecting it and that's good. - Right. - I'd sure like to meet that doctor you two have been tellin' me about. Price is right too, Maggie. - I'm not going back inside. - You won't have to. [Maggie sighs] - Okay. [Randolph hums melodically] - [Prisoner] Hey, Doctor, you god damn [mumbles] [can clinks] [prisoners moan] [moody string music] [drill buzzes] [snoring] - [Driver] Is everybody comfortable back there? [giggles] - [Guard] Shit, man, I've had to piss for about two hours. - Ladies! Must be one of them runaways. - God damnit. Hey, when are we gonna get there anyway? - [Maggie] Okay, buddy, nice and easy now, drop that bottle! No more brew for you, lard ass. [guns fire] [screams] [driver groans] - [Jackie] God. - It's only a scratch! [grunts] Anybody got a bandaid? - A bandaid, a bandaid. - My name's Crazy, honey, what's yours? - Bernice. - Two choices, Bernice. Do what we say, starting now, or say goodbye to the world. - I'll take the first. [lively harmonica music] - Who were those? Watch it, here comes a ride. - Hello, pretty chicky babies! Climb on in! Oh, all kinds of good things. [Randolph hums melodically] [clock ticks rhythmically] - Guard, guard, I'm hurt! - [Maggie] Welcome home, kid. - Hi, Bernice. - Hi. Hey, where's Bif? - He got the clap. [guard laughs] - [Bernice] So let us through, we're very late. - Okay, go ahead!
