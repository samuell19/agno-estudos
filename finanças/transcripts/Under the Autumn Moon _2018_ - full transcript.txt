Here you go Alex. Thank you Carla. Roger wants to see you by 2:00. Did he say why? No, just for you to stop by. Interesting, thanks. Morning Stan. Those new air wheels look great. Thanks. The new SF-15's came in. Adjusted bindings? Yeah great specs. Wanna take it out on a field test this weekend? Absolutely. Have fun. Why don't you do it Alex? I can't remember the last time you did a field test. Have you ever done a field test? Good morning Ben. Those are fantastic. I'm gonna need a new vendor report on those by Monday though. Will do. I saw you finally got the kinks out of the Kaza Insta-Cabin. Yes we did, thank you so much for your concern about our new products. - Morning Phil. - Hey. I like to keep up with what's happening with new vendors. It's all part of being a good VP. But you're not a VP. Well, not yet. You're a director, just like me. But I have plans. But there still needs to be a job opening. You haven't heard. Heard what? Hey Alex, Ben. Hello Roger. Looking good Roger. Hey Alex, I know we're supposed to meet later but grab a helmet and join me. It'll be fun! I have 9:30 call with Oslo. We're on-boarding a new ski vendor, so. That's fantastic news. It is fantastic news, especially since I just found a place where we can distribute our new gear. You did? Where? Hackett, Arizona, former tire factory, perfect for the distribution center you wanted. What about it's environmental compliance? They're already up on all the green building council standards with just the bare minimum for us to get it in shape for our usage. Well alrighty. Grab a helmet Ben and tell me more. On my way. Told you I had plans. It's my fault. I should have just gone up when Roger asked me too. Why didn't you? You know I don't rock climb. Kayak, or ski. Camp. - And yet. - And yet. How do you say no to a job at the biggest outdoor recreational goods retailer? You don't. Exactly. I mean the company's reputation is the reason why I agreed to be recruited. Even if outdoorsy isn't exactly my natural orientation. Executive assistant grapevine says Tom Davis is staying in Spain after his honeymoon, which means... A VP spot is opening up. Ben's gonna go hard for that spot, and he has seniority. Well, you may have only been at Great Frontiers for a year... And a half. But Roger respects you. Maybe that's why Roger wants to talk with you later. I hadn't thought about that. But Ben's already got the lead on Roger's new distribution center so... So? Find something else to take the lead on. Alright. Alright. Young man, a little memento from your stay with us. Thanks so much. Alright, all for you, high five. High five, alright. Thank you so much Josh. No problem. Michael. Hey, how are you? Good to have you back. Yeah, great to be back. - How are you? - Good, good, good. - Good. - I left the office and went straight to Fresno airport. You know I'm not gonna miss the centennial now. It would not have been the same with you. Checked in? No, no. I'm gonna do that right now. Get checked in, come meet me. - Okay, see you in a bit. - Alright, see you. There you go. Okay. Hi, hello, how are you? Is that Serena Monroe's car I saw leaving? It was. That's okay. She make us an offer? She did. Good. I'll file it away in my special filing cabinet. That is why, I do the filing. It's a good offer Josh. It's a good offer in theory. I don't need to read that contract from that ranch to know that they just wanna level this place for pasture. And if the banks cared about keeping this place intact we wouldn't be where we are. But numbers with deadlines are all banks care about. And we need to start caring too, while we still have a say in the matter. Which we won't by the end of the month. The centennial is in a week. I know. And Serena says she wants an answer by then. She knows exactly when the banks will come calling. Dad, would be really upset. If he knew we were thinking about selling this place. But, dad didn't wanna turn Harmony into a Dude Ranch either. But we did. We had to. And it almost worked. Almost. Hey, Grace said I should just... Yes, here. Try this. Potential vendor. Okay. What is it supposed to be? In theory, freeze dried lasagna. Tastes like oatmeal. I'll put that down as a pass. But that is not why you're here. I think, I think a change is in order. Regarding? The Great Frontiers Retreat. Retreat? Retreat. As you know, every year we pick some place new. Maui, Yosemite, Grand Camen, that was nice. But, I have a new idea. Harmony Dude Ranch in North Dakota. Dude? Ranch. I've always had a soft spot for the Old West. This one's new on the market, 700 acres, owned by a brother and sister, Josh and Taylor Ketchum. Hold on, you're thinking about buying? I am. That's the new idea. Only for a retreat? Do you have another suggestion? Well, it's just, company wide we only have a few retreats every year. That's true. Wait, what about, what if we used it as something else for the rest of the time? Like an employee training center? I mean, we're growing out of the one in Denver. I like where you're going. I mean, we, we could even do our boot camps there. Yes, well that's perfect. I want you to go and scout the place and see if it's up to Great Frontier standards. You want me to scout? I know, I know, normally Ben goes. But he's off to Arizona scouting the potential distribution center. Right it's just... It should only take a couple of days. But it has to be ASAP. My agent tells me there's another offer on the place. But I'm... Look, if Harmony isn't right, we'll pass. By then Ben should be back and he can take it from there. What do you say? Reception's a bit spotty out here. Harmony Ranch is just up ahead. Thank you. Great, good stuff. Welcome to Harmony. Hi, I'm a late arrival. Miss McKenna, from Great Frontiers? Yes, please call me Alex. You, must be one the Ketchum's? Sure am, Taylor Ketchum, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. This place is amazing. Thanks, I grew up here so it's kind of hard to have perspective. I know exactly what you mean. I grew up in suburban Ohio, I didn't realize how beautiful it was until I left. Well I'll have to take your word for it. The leaving, coming back part. I've never been to Ohio, I mean I've never been anywhere really. Though I'd like to go places. Okay, let's get you situated. Okay. Alright. Thanks. - Hey Josh. - What you doing Michael? Not much. Kind of overslept, missed the lasso lesson this morning. How long you been coming here? I don't know, five years, why? You should know it's a lariat, not a lasso. Right, sorry. How about now? Yeah, now's fine, let's go. I can't believe you guys are selling the ranch, it seems so popular. Yeah, this week sure. But that's because of our centennial celebration. A lot of our regular guests are back, so we're busier than usual. But catch us most any other time and there are half as many folks here. It's so beautiful. Thanks, but we got a late start in the dude ranch business. We were still a working ranch only until six years ago. What made you change it? Our dad passed away. I'm so sorry. Thank you. Dad thought dude ranches were basically resorts, and he wasn't wrong. But maybe if we'd gone that route earlier. I know you're just taking a look around for your boss. But, if you don't mind, I'd appreciate it if you'd keep the fact we're selling to yourself at this point. I don't wanna upset any long time guests. My lips are sealed. Is this my cabin? It is, well your's and Jill's. Jill? Jill Tanner from Modesto, nice to meet you Alex. And you are my? Cabin mate for a couple of days. I just thought that... Your reservation came so last second that we had to bunk up. Mr. Hilton's office said it would okay since you were only gonna be here 'til the day after tomorrow. That is true. And the only other option was the Rant Hand Bunkhouse. Well, we'll be fine. This is great. Okay. I have to head back to the front desk and I have to start prepping the coal's for dinner. Taylor's barbecue is the best. And my pumpkin cheesecake's even better. Accurate. Don't fret, I promise I'm great at sharing. You can ask my ex-husband. Gary, it's all amicable. I'm the kind of person that always wanted to go outdoors and find adventures and he was more of a watch adventures from a distance kind of guy. So now I can come to Harmony for a fresh start and meet new people, like you. Look at me over-sharing. Okay then. Come on, let me show you your room. Wait, okay. Alright. Okay. I think. You got this. Geeze. There you go. Alrighty. And then when you get, when you get really good. You start doing this stuff? Whoa, Josh. I am so sorry. I'm sorry. Most guys just ask for my number. You you alright? Yeah. This is what we call a funny story one day. Let's start over Josh Ketchum, I'm co-owner of Harmony. Alex McKenna. Nice to meet you, this is Michael Getts. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. McKenna, I don't... I just got here. Late arrival. Yeah no, I just, I get all the names. I just don't recognize that one. Welcome. Don't get mad. Well there's practically a guarantee he's gonna get mad. Why am I getting mad? See. Nothing's official. Are you a lawyer or something? Definitely not. Okay, then what brings you here? It's the ranch. To scout and possibly buy. Are you from Monroe? Because Monroe knows what this property looks like. I'm sorry, what's Monroe? Alex is from Great Frontiers. I don't know that ranch. No it's not a ranch, we're the leading online retailer of sportswear, camping gear and mountaineering equipment. You've really never heard of us? Do you sell cowboy boots? Actually no. Then no. So you'll understand that I don't understand why you'd want to buy this place. I'm just here to scout and possibly buy for a company retreat and training center. A retreat and training center. I wish we had a contract. You do? Yes, I'd file it in my special file. Miss McKenna, I don't wanna sell this ranch. I especially don't wanna sell it to some corporate raider who doesn't have enough sense to wear the proper boots. These are excellent boots. They're not for riding, that's what we do here. I'm very sorry to waste your time. I apologize, my brother can be a little stubborn. Well as it happens that makes two of us. Alex McKenna's office. Hello Carla, Carla. Alex? Carla hi. I'm so glad I got through. Where are you right now? I am standing under a tree next to a pond, the guests call it two bar tree, it's like the only place here you can get any cell service. I just emailed you some pictures of the ranch. Ooh, it's pretty. It's even prettier in person. Roger is gonna love this place. Do they wanna sell? Well the sister does and from what she said the finances are little precarious which actually works out in our favor. I thought you were just scouting. I am. But if Roger buys Harmony based on my info, that'll put me in a good position. The VP position. Exactly. Hey, will you do me a favor since you're basically my only access to wifi right now. Can you look up Monroe Ranch for me? Monroe. Looks like they're a ranching conglomeration. Makes sense. Think they're the other offer. We haven't put in a offer? Yet. Hey folks, if I can grab your attention for one second I just wanted to remind everyone that this is gonna be Harmony Ranch's centennial celebration coming up, this Saturday. We're expecting a pretty good crowd. We've all had Taylor's cooking by now so you know how good the food's gonna be. Especially the pies. Pecan, my favorite. I just wanna give a heartfelt thank you to all of you for being here. We see a lot of familiar faces and your loyalty is very appreciated so I just wanna say thank you. That's enough talking by me, enjoy your night. Enjoy the food. I ate way too much. Jill Tanner? Michael Getts? What are you doing here? You told me about this place ages ago. Yeah but... Michael, this is Alex, my temporary cabin mate. Alex, this is Michael. An old co-worker of mine. Yes. We met earlier. Jill here, was the best Human Resources Director ever. Oh stop. It's true though. I'm sure it is. She was fantastic. I can't believe I'm seeing you. Can you guys excuse me? - See you later. - Okay. Hey, shall we? Yeah. Good to see you. Mr. Ketchum. Was my father. Josh. Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. You do need to sell the ranch, don't you? It is looking that way. Monroe's the only bidder so far? Perhaps. How much time do you have left with your creditors? If I told you that, I'd be a terrible businessman. And contrary to my present situation, I'm not a terrible businessman. Good to know. Look, I deal with vendors all the time, so I have a pretty good sense of when someone's running out of time for other offers. My, my assistant tells me that Monroe is major ranch conglomeration so it's unlikely they're gonna keep Harmony intact. And Great Frontiers will? They will keep this a company retreat? We wanna buy a ranch, not a piece of land. I appreciate those words. But I still think there's a better way Miss McKenna. - Alex. - Alex. Our team here at Caribbean Calypso Cruises prides itself on creating fun filled, ocean excursions that our passengers will remember for a lifetime. And if you're interested in travel and adventure then sign up today and see what's waiting over the horizon. I knew if I showed up here at the crack of dawn I'd find you. Morning Serena. Don't be mad at me. What do you expect? You're trying to buy my ranch. You're selling it. No, Taylor. Taylor put it on the market, not me. She's always been the sensible one between the two of you. So what am I? You're the same guy you were in high school. The kind who pretends to be practical. Always wishing on stars and hoping that Harmony Ranch will return to its glory days. But that's not gonna happen. That's why I should sell to you? I'm not the bad guy here Josh. I am trying to make the best of a bad situation. So you'll keep it intact? You know that's not on the agenda. Unfortunately the answer's still no. Hey, hey. Josh, between Monroe Ranch and the bank at least we're the known entity. Who knows what could happen if the bank repossesses and sells it to some stranger. Think about that. Miss McKenna. Would you mind if we spoke in private? So if Great Frontiers buys this place you're going to keep it as a ranch? I'm pretty sure that's the plan. I need you to be really sure. Alex, Harmony is so much more than just these pictures you've been taking. I need to preserve some of that and I need you to understand this place like I understand it in order to make that happen. - So if... - So show me. Guide me through the ranch experience so I fully understand. In what a day? You're leaving tomorrow? What if I extend my trip through the weekend? Does that work for you? Yeah. Yeah, that'll work for me. Great, when do we start? Dawn. Dawn. Great. Now repeat. What you listening to? Italian lessons. For cooking? No, for life. You know, in case I ever go to Italy. Have you thought about what you'll do next? You know, once Harmony... No coffee for me, thanks. It's not for you. Well then who's it for? Miss McKenna. Pause, back up, what? Gonna show her round the ranch the next couple of days and make sure she sees it like we do. Why? 'Cause I'd like to know there's at least a chance of preserving Harmony's history. Whoa, I thought this was a Dude Ranch. It's not all horses. Michael and I are going bike riding. You and Michael. It's not like that. We worked together. Right, back when you were married. Well, true. You're not married now. Also true. So it could be like that? That never occurred. I haven't been on a date in 15 years. I look like I'm going on the Tour De France. You like you're going on a bike ride and are very well protected. Look, I'm gonna be staying for a couple more days, through the centennial, I'll talk to Taylor about moving. Don't be silly. This cabin's too big for only me. This is perfect. Michael. Do you think I have time to change? I think you're good. She's up. You said dawn. I did, I just didn't think you'd make it. Well it shows you. You, exceptionally thirsty. Figured you for a coffee drinker. I am but I'm also extremely picky about my coffee. Try it. How? Well, cowboys are picky about our coffee too. That is good. You do know, we have to fix this right? What's wrong with my boots? Everything. Lost and found. It never ceases to amaze me what some people leave behind. Are there any other options? That is the last in a ladies size six. Your jeans, we might wanna fix that. These are Armani. I know, that's my point. Let's see. These should work. Okay. - What's your favorite color? - Pink. Let's go with blue, matches your eyes. Is there anything else? It gets a bit chilly so. There we go. Perfect. You want me to clean the stables? That's right. Interesting sales technique you have Mr. Ketchum. Well, you wanted to see a side of the ranch that wasn't so pretty. This definitely qualifies. Cleaning stalls was the very first chore that Dad gave Taylor and I. Said it was the foundation of any ranch. Explain. Well, having a comfortable place for the horses to sleep keeps them calm. And since they're the backbone of everything we do here, as long as they're happy, things run smoothly. Well unfortunately for me, that is perfectly logical. But I would counter with the fact that no one from my company is gonna wanna do this on a retreat. Really? Yep. Team building. Nothing bonds people like tedious labor. Right. Do you need me to explain it you or? No, I got this. Let's see it. Give me a little warning next time. Sorry. Hay's coming in. Thank you. Okay. Okay, that's enough, You have goats? I hope so, otherwise I'm not sure who I've been feeding for the past year. Hey. Here, you wanna feed 'em? - Yes. - Look, he's already started. Come here. - Come on guys. - Come see. - Come on, come on. - Alright well, this is Matilda and Shelby, Mary-Beth. This Miss Susie, Miss Courtney's over here. Hello. Yeah, guys not too aggressive. We're trying to impress this lady. Well then maybe you should have led with the goats. Done with your diet yet? Yeah. When do I get to ride? One thing at a time. - Oh man. - There we go. Whoa. Yeah service, you never know when you're gonna get it. Do you mind if I make a call while I've got it? No, no, no, go ahead, go ahead. Enjoy these guys. Roger Hilton. Hi, it's Alex. My what a lovely singing voice you must have? Sorry, I tried to call earlier. Service is pretty hit and miss around here, mostly miss. Gotta grab it while I can. Are you heading back soon? That is what I wanted to talk to you about. I'm gonna need to stay a couple more days. Why? Well, I came to an agreement with one of the owners. Josh. What agreement? You're out there to scout, not make deals. I know, it's just if we want a chance to make a deal then we have to get them to let us be the one to buy it. So there is another buyer? Yeah, it's, it's a big ranch. They wanna swallow Harmony up. But Josh does not want that. Ah ha, and what does Josh want? To keep his families ranch the way it's been for the past 100 years. If we can convince him we'll do that, we can beat out the other buyer. He wants to show me the finer points of ranch life so I better appreciate what this place has to offer. Really? Are you okay with that? Absolutely, it's been, it's been interesting so far but, I need to stay through until Saturday. They're having a centennial celebration. A celebration, I love a celebration. Do I have your okay then? You do, just be back in the office by Monday with a full report. Okay. And Alex, don't make any promises to the Ketchum's. I got it. Smoothie? No, I'm good. Are you ready to talk about this? Let's do it. So you were sent here to scout and not make an offer? That's right. It seems like you wanna buy this place. I mean, why would you be doing all this stuff? It's a long story. Well, good thing we have time. And you wanna massage it all the way to the seam. Yeah. There's a VP position opening. I'm in competition with someone for it. He's bringing in a big deal, so I need to bring one in too if I want a shot. So it's just business? You say that like it's a bad thing. It is, if it's the only thing. Come on, you're one to talk. Your entire life is about the business of this ranch. Now how would you know what my whole life's about? Okay fine. Tell me one of your interests outside ranching. And don't say football, 'cause all guys say football. Stars. I can name every single major constellation in the Northern hemisphere. Well I guess, I guess North Dakota's probably pretty good for that kind of thing. It is one of the best. You tried it. I haven't had a chance yet. I fell asleep super early last night. It's funny, usually I am up all night on my phone answering a million emails, but I can't do that here. Perfect. Lose the phone. Embrace the nighttime sky. I mean, the moons almost full, so the stars aren't as bright. But it's amazing. I just might do that. You should. Okay, so outside of work, what are some of your interests? Football. Are you okay? Yeah I'm fine. I'm telling you that rock came out of nowhere. They're known for their stealth. That's impressive. You managed to hit the one spot that wasn't protected. Yeah, it's okay. It's nothing. Yeah, it's just my shoulder, it's good, yeah. Hold on strong man. Just until we get back to the ranch. - Alright, what? - You can ride with one arm. What are you? Some kind of field doctor or something. Well, I'm a mom so same thing. Hey so how are the twins? They just started middle school. Really? Gary has them this week so uh. Are you, are you okay with all that? Oh great. Gary's great, I'm great. We just ultimately weren't great together. It happens. I see. What about you? Are you dating? Not since Susie. Do you, do you remember her? Is she the one who brought her dinner to the Christmas party? Yeah, yeah she was always really particular about her food. No, but we broke up not long after I got my new job. No one since. Not yet. I mean this time, I'm shooting for amazing. Well, who knows, maybe she'll come out of nowhere when you least expect it. Like a rock. Right but how are you not a Seahawks fan? Because I grew up in Ohio. And you pick your team when you're little and you stick with it for the rest of your life no matter what. Those are the rules, don't ask me why. Believe me there are times every season I wish I was born in Boston. No thanks. This is GG. Hi GG. It's one of Taylor's horses. She's a beauty. Hi. You ever ridden a horse? It used to be my whole life. Horses? Yeah. Really? Yeah, I rode dressage for five years. Up until I turned 15. What made you quit? Money. Yeah, money. My mom sold insurance, my dad was a high school science teacher. They both knew how much it meant to me, so they worked extra so I could keep riding and competing. When I realized how hard it was on them, I quit. Really? Just like that? Probably counts as my first heartbreak. Have you ridden since? No. Maybe we should change that. - Yeah. - Yeah. Man, I am impressed. Now we just need to get you a hat. Why do you have any in the lost and found? 'Cause I'm almost as picky about my head wear as I am about my coffee. Lost and found huh? I knew I recognized those boots. Hey, I'm about to go into town to get some supplies for the centennial, do you wanna come with and pick up some new clothes? I would love that. Great. Bye. You like her? Yeah, I think so too. You know, I can't help but noticing. As resistant as Josh is to the idea of selling the ranch, you don't seem quite so upset about it. Don't get me wrong, I love the ranch. This whole place. I mean, my heritage is here. I even convinced Josh to build a little museum to the history of Harmony. But? But the world's a lot bigger than one ranch and I wanna see it. I have friends from high school already on their third passport. And here I am, building barbecues and making pies. All of which are good, trust me. So okay, clothes are in here, food is at the back. So I'm gonna gather my supplies and then we can meet back here at the beep. Great. Taylor? Shh. Shh, shh, shh. What? What? Who is that? Serena Monroe. Monroe as in Monroe Ranch? She's gonna push me for an answer about buying the ranch and we don't have one yet. Okay well then definitely stay back. Okay. Thanks so much. Okay she's gone, you're good. Serena's always been a little intimidating for me. I was even nervous around her when she and Josh used to date. Wait, so Serena and Josh used... Yeah. But that was before he went to college and met Claire. She was the one who broke his heart. Claire. She was his fiancee for two years in grad school and then one day he came home from Ithaca and they weren't engaged anymore and he never talked about it, but I could tell it bothered him. Wait you don't think Serena trying to buy the ranch is personal do you? No, it's just good business. And if there's anything that Serena's all about it's business. Actually Claire was like that too. I guess Josh has a type. And that's me totally over-sharing about my brother. It's okay. Am I interrupting? Ben, perfect. This will go much faster with two people. Is that the um... Fold kayak, prototype from Oregon. Lighter material. Come on. So what brings you by? Well, I've been doing some more research on the Arizona distribution facility. Just pop that into place there. Thinking long term, it occurs to me we'll probably need a second one within a couple of years. Tighten your bow strap. A second one what? A second distribution facility. So the way I'm figuring is, why not secure that second site right now while we're already thinking about what we really need. And your bow faring. This time we build it from scratch, we build it to our own specifications, like we've always talked about. Do you have a place in mind? I do. Harmony Ranch, North Dakota. Hi. Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you. No it's okay. Taylor told me about this place earlier so I wanted to check it out. So all of this is Harmony. Mostly, but, also an ethos. Yeah. That's Hank Ketchum, he founded the ranch. And had a flair for fashion. Yes he did. How long has the ranch been in your family? Four generations. Hoping there'll be a fifth. Did you know how much trouble the ranch was in? No. No dad was in charge and I was away at grad school until six years ago. Where'd you go? Cornell. MS in Animal Science. And it's also where I ran across a little coffee shop called Aunt Marie's Coffee and I still get the beans from there to this day. I fully support that extravagant decision. Yeah. Thank you. And by the way, love the outfit. Thank you. I'm aware that it's funny but I work for an outdoor adventure gear company and I had to get my ranch wardrobe at a local general store but... I see you kept the boots? Well, they're worn in. It's more comfortable. Or you just, you just like them? Possibly. But if that's spreaded outside this four walls I'm gonna deny it. Okay, that'll be our secret. So what's the centennial gonna be like? Well this normally when we have our fall celebration, so centennial will just take its spot, you know. But, we'll do some fun stuff. You know music, games. That does sound fun. Yeah, Taylor's gonna bake about 1,000 pies. Having just gone shopping with her, yes she is. What are you gonna do to celebrate the history of the place? You know, you're just gonna have to wait and see. Mysterious. So I have to know, after your first full day as a rancher has come to a close, what do you think? I had such a wonderful time, I loved being able to ride again, thank you. You're welcome. And also purport for you tomorrow, so feel free to sleep in. Thank you. I'll come find you around noon? Noon it is. Okay. Have a good night Miss McKenna. Goodnight. Nice! I am loving this trip. Does a certain Michael Getts have anything to do with that? He's not hurting the experience. Was yesterday a date? I can't quite tell. You know how long it's been since I had to read dating signals? Men are so complicated. Still, it's kind of nice to even be having the discussion. What about you? What about me? Can you have the discussion? No there is no discussion to be had. Really? Because you're spending an awful lot of time with him. He's just showing me the ranch, you know, in case Great Frontiers wants to invest or something. Invest really. That'd be good. Yeah. It would. Yes. Thanks. Hey GG, hey girl. Thanks man. Hello beauty. Boss, boss. You will experience many different climates on top the highest mountain in Africa. Our summit tour will take you across an exposed ridge and then onto broad snow slopes and eventually onto the final summit ridge at an altitude of nearly 6,000 meters. Acclimatization is key to any successful trek up the mountain. Focusing on the details is the difference between making it to the top. Or not. Hey. I see you made a friend. I have. Hello. Hey, Josh. You better come up to the house, Taylor's hurt. What? I tripped on my own feet and I landed on my hand. Okay, I can make fun of you about that later. - Can I see it? - Yeah. Let's see. Can you move your fingers? No. Let's get you to the ER. But I have to bake pies for the centennial. I think that can wait. Let's get you to... Yeah but look at the big mess, I can't... Don't worry, I'll clean up here. Thank you. Thanks, come on. Okay. Hey Josh, we heard Taylor got hurt. Is she alright? She's fine, it's her, her wrist. Sprained, it's not broken. We just got back from the emergency room. So, she's resting right now. That's good. Well okay. I'm trying. Have you ever made a pie before? No, but I'm using all of Taylor's recipe. And praying, a lot. Well, your prayer is officially answered because I'm an amazing baker. Thank you. You're welcome. And you two, this is a big job. I'm in. Nope. Hey you know, feel free to go get some sleep if you like? I can get the rest of this. No, I'm almost done. I'm not gonna leave you now. Look, thank you very much, for all of this. This has been great. I'm just, earning my keep. Yeah. Can I ask you a question? Yeah. How do you still have flour in your hair? Look at this. Morning. Morning. How you feeling? Swellings already way down. What a relief. Thank you, and Michael and Jill for baking all the pies. And Josh too, I mean he was big help. I still can't wrap my head around Josh baking, How did you get him to do it? I just handed him a bowl. Good morning. Hi. It has occurred to me Miss McKenna, you have yet to experience the most basic excursion on this ranch. And what is that? Trail riding. Finally. - Let's go. - Okay. How's it feel? It's amazing. Yes it is. You know what, come and see. There's something I want to show you. So this was the first cabin built on the property. My great grandfather built it 100 years ago. 100 years ago. You guys have really kept it up. Well it's all Taylor. The centennial. It's a special place, you know my grandfather was actually born here. Yeah he used to teach us all about the stars and the constellations and the moon too. Moon gazing? Wishing on a moon, especially an autumn moon. Why an autumn moon? It's the only time the weather's really cool enough, you can pause to reflect. Take stock of what you have. Yeah. It's so peaceful here. It's almost hard to believe there was one point when I was getting my masters I almost didn't come back here. Why? Love, or what I thought was love, but it turns out it wasn't. I guess everyone gets hurt from time to time. Not me, not really. I mean a few bruises here and there but. I guess I never really had time for real risk. Why is that? My parents made so many sacrifices for me growing up, I didn't want to let 'em down. So I worked really hard, so I could get a scholarship and go to the best school, so I could get the best job. And the best job after that. Yeah. And now I've got this great job but, working really hard for a promotion so. What do you thinks next for you after that? I don't know. I thought I knew. Josh, I work for an outdoors adventure company and I don't have time to go outdoors and have an adventure. That's not right. So not right. But this. I mean all of this, and the horses. This feels right. Why do you think I fight so hard for this place? I get it. It has to stay a ranch, it has to stay Harmony. I'll fight for it, I promise. Glad to hear it. Alex McKenna's office. Hey it's me. Where have you been? Riding, looking at old cabins, baking an endless number of pies. Seriously? Seriously. Seriously? Is pie baking something they do on the dude ranch? Well there was special circumstances involving a centennial and a trip to the emergency room. Is, is Roger there? No. He left this afternoon, on a trip. It looks like Ben went with him. Ben, that's odd. I can check with Ben's office. No, it's okay. Does it say when he'll be back? His calendar says Monday. I need to talk to him. Great Frontiers has got to get this ranch. Where the pies the clincher? Everything's been a clincher. Just let me know when Roger gets back. Okay, I'll do my best. But you're not easy to get a hold of right now. Isn't it amazing. You're scaring me, bye. I'm just glad you're better hun. I think my pride has a much bigger wound. I mean, I'm so clumsy I tripped over my own feet. I'm gonna file that visual away with so many memories I have from here. I told her Harmony was a great place. Yes you did. He'd come back in the office after spending time here and say "guys, guys, you have to hear about my amazing weekend here at the ranch". I used to also say you'd love Harmony. I remember, that's why I came here. To see if you were right. You were right. Alright. Well I'm glad you came. Otherwise we would have no pies for tomorrow. Yes. That's my sign to run in. Me too. I'll take you. Tomorrow's a big day, goodnight. - Goodnight, goodnight. - Night. - Goodnight. - Night guys. - Night buddy. - Goodnight. You turning in too? Not yet. All that talk about the moon earlier made me realize I haven't had a chance to go stargazing yet. I know a great spot. Lead the way. Tomorrow's the centennial, I go home after that. Yeah, me too. I've had a lot of fun. So have I, a lot. Thanks to you. Well, goodnight. I went to two bar tree this morning, to, you know, google the distance between Modesto and Fresno. And? It's basically an hour and a half. That's not far at all. No it isn't, at all. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay, tomorrow. Okay so, there's Orion. That's an easy one, anyone can find him. He's always got his belt done up. Alright. Alright something more difficult. Yeah, come on, dazzle me. Okay. Okay. There's Pegasus. Where? There. You see the four stars that kind of make a square? - Where? - Right here. - Yeah. - And the two, the two that are coming down, that are forming the legs. Okay. And then the top right makes the head. Yeah, I totally see it. You would pick the horse. I would. If you're cold we can go in? No I'm good. There you are. Didn't mean to interrupt. No, everything okay? Everything's fine. We just had a couple of unexpected guests. Okay, did you tell 'em we're fully booked? No, I gave 'em the bunkhouse. Why? Because they're from Great Frontiers and one them is her boss. There we go guys, cheers. More coffee? Thank you. My compliments to the chef. Thanks, it's one of my specialties. How did you? It turns out I've made eggs Florentine so many times I actually can do it one handed. Besides, I'm on the mend. Well very impressive Miss Ketchum. Much appreciated Mr. Hilton. What are you and Roger doing here? Not sleeping well, that's for sure. Nice boots. Way to, way to commit. - Ben. - You know Roger snores. Loudly. Do I smell like a horse? I feel like I smell like a horse. It's a dude ranch Ben. And stop evading my question, why are you here? You know Roger he likes to see things with his own eyes, kick the tires before making a move, you know. So he's gonna make a move? On Harmony? Yeah, I'm sure of it. Did I see you holding Alex's hand last night? Her hands were cold. Okay. She's leaving, it's not... Yeah, but if her company buys Harmony then they'll come back. She might be back, and then you could stay on. And be an employee at my own ranch? No. Hey man, Taylor. - Thank you. - Thank you. No, I'm not interested. Yeah but if Alex was here? Josh. No, no. Vera. Are you are you Josh Ketchum? I am. I thought I recognized you from your ranch's webpage. I'm Roger Hilton. Mr. Hilton. Roger. What a place you have. I wouldn't be able to get anything done. I would be riding, fishing or staring at all the natural beauty. Yeah, thank you. Well you would, until a horse came and nudged you because it was ready to be fed. Good point. Have you seen Alex? I have not, not since last night. Okay, well, I'll probably run into her at the centennial. 100 years huh? That's impressive. Thank you. I'll let you get back to things. You probably have a busy day ahead of you. I do, but I'd be happy to show you around a little, if you'd like? I'm gonna explore on my own, if that's okay with you? That's okay. Nice meeting you. Who's ready for some rope tricks? There we go. Alright, here's a fun fact about these tricks. My grandfather, Hank Ketchum, he taught 'em to me. I'm gonna teach 'em to you. So we're gonna start with the first one. This is called the flat round okay. Here we go. Alright. Let's see, I'm gonna need some help. Who can help me? Who wants to volunteer? Boy, young man let's have you. Here we go. Here I'll trade. Oh my gosh, look at him. Did you have fun? Alright, thanks for coming again. Good seeing you bud. Alright, thanks so much. Why Hank Ketchum, I do declare. Ma'am. - Your tribute... - You like it? Was perfect. Yeah, I get why people wanna come out to the West for a few days, act like a cowboy or cowgirl, I get it. So I have some news. Some news? - Yeah. - Okay. I spoke with my colleague Ben. Ben's the one that came with Roger right? - Yes. - Okay. And he's pretty sure that Roger wants to buy Harmony. And keep it intact like it is? I think so. Yes. Oh my gosh, thank you so much. Thank you so much. No, don't thank me. It's you, you're the one who kept this place working all these years. I'm so glad you did. You really like it here don't you? Are you kidding? I love it, I really do. Yeah, that's good. Okay. That's great. - I gotta... - Yeah. Talk to Roger. Yeah, okay, yeah. - Okay. - Alright. Hey Alex. Yeah. Save me a dance later? I'll save two. Yes. Close, close. Very nice. Roger. There she is. I was so surprised when Taylor told me you were here. Well, I had to come for the celebration. Have you had chance to look around? A little, I got up at first light, went for a walk. Tried to get Ben to come with. Yeah, my hips still cramped from sleeping on the sofa. Well I can assure you the guest cabins are much nicer. Employee's are gonna be fighting over who gets which one. For? The retreat here at Harmony. I already bought a new company retreat. Sorry what? Yeah a great deal came up yesterday for a property in Hawaii. Ben just said that... Yeah I said he was interested in buying Harmony, I never said it was for the retreat. Then what are you? Well Ben suggested we build a second distribution center here. Totally new, from the ground up. Seriously? Don't you like the idea? Josh is never gonna go for that. Then we don't tell Josh. Don't tell Josh what? Josh, didn't know you were there. Don't tell Josh what? That Roger is afraid of horses. That's okay. You're just planning on tearing this place down? After you buy it. Build a giant warehouse for all your adventure stuff. I guess I was standing there a little bit longer than you thought. Josh. I've heard enough. Josh. Well, looks like the Harmony deal just fell through. Fortunately we still have the Arizona distribution center in place, so I guess we can get going on that, yeah. Josh. Josh. You have to believe me, I had no idea this was gonna happen. I know. Alex I thought that selling my families heritage for pasture was a bad idea, but a distribution center is much worse. I'm so sorry. I wish there was something more I could do. Maybe this is a good thing. You know, Taylor, she's ready to travel. This ranch is holding her back, that's not fair to her. What about you? I'll be fine. Thank you for trying to help. I had to, I love this place. Me too. Hey. Sorry, it's too good. So that's it then? That's it. What now? We sell. It's been inevitable. I just had a hard time admitting it. It's so weird looking out at all this activity and it won't change a thing. Yeah. You should know I had a conversation with Alex and maybe this is a good thing. How'd you figure? I've been working too hard hanging onto the past and maybe it's time to let it go, let you go. Off on your adventures. You know I do love this place. I know you do. Got a lot of good memories here. And we'll always have each other. You're not getting rid of me that easy. Lasso your friends, embarrass you a little bit. You're gonna have to find me first. The lesser of two evils. Yep. Hey, yeah. Roger. Alex, before you say anything, I have one question. Do you know where they keep the waders? What? 'Cause I think we should go fishing. I love fishing. I love nature. That's why I started Great Frontiers in the first place. For people like me who love being outdoors in all its glory. Can we just talk about this now? Yeah, in a minute. You know I think it's important in life that a person loves what they do and does what they love. 'Cause then it will have meaning and value. When you truly value something you always strive to do right by it. Look, if you love nature as much as you claim you do then even the idea of tearing all of this down, getting rid of the ranch just so we can have another warehouse. It should be appalling to you. I know I think it is. Do you? Yes. Why? Because it's wrong. I mean, these trees, this river... the horses. People. They all have value. And that is why I wanted you to be the one to come out here. What? You are an intelligent person. A great executive, your coworkers love you yet you're not a pushover. But if you're gonna move up into the VP position, I need to know that you love what I love. This. So my coming out here was... I like to think of it as a fishing expedition, of a kind. If I had to choose between the development and the land. Which would it be? The land. That's what I like to hear. Look, I love my company and I'm proud of what we've become but it can't all be about business. But this second distribution center? That was never a consideration. Ben thought it was. Which is why he doesn't work for me as of about 42 minutes ago. I wanted to know if he could still push for his project if he saw the beauty first hand. He could. So, what are you planning for Harmony? Nothing. I chose a dude ranch, mainly because of your history with equestrian riding. You know about that? Our background checks are very thorough. I thought you'd respond well to horses again. Okay, but what about the new Great Frontiers retreat? Well, I really did get a great deal in Hawaii. But, but what do you think I should do? I think. I think I have a new idea I wanna run by you. That just might give everyone what they want. So does that mean Harmony won't be open for guests anymore? It won't be open for anyone. I'm sorry. Honey, don't apologize. You're the one having to leave your home. Yeah. It's becoming real. Do you know where Josh is? He's with Serena. Why? To sign the contracts. Oh no. No, where are they? In the house. So this includes all the horses? Yes, they'll be well taken care of. I know, you love your horses. You can come visit them anytime you want. Like I said, I'm not the bad guy here. Stop. Josh, you don't wanna do this. This is the best option. What if it's not? Who are you? I'm Alex McKenna. I'm the new VP at Great Frontiers and I have a proposition for you. So it seems like everyone has an opinion about what to do with Harmony Ranch. Serena wanted to turn it into graze land. And Great Frontiers has discussed repurposing the land for a distribution warehouse. And I originally came out here to scout it for a training center and retreat. But the best idea, would be to keep it the way it is, only busier. How? Well dude ranches are big business. Everyone loves coming here and dressing up like a cowboy, or a cowgirl and going on adventures. True. And while Great Frontiers is an amazing company with millions of loyal customers. We've never had a Western outfitting division, until now. We wanna have a reliable partnership destination for our customers, as an incentive. We call it Great Frontiers at Harmony Ranch. Your ranch, our products, everybody wins. We'll pay off what you owe the bank and go forward as equal partners, if that's alright with you? And? Right. Taylor, it turns out the Great Frontiers team is in dire need of an executive chef and we have offices all over the world and I spend a good deal of time visiting them all. - I don't suppose... - Yes, yes. Don't you want to hear the full offer? No, no, no, I get it. I'm your chef, if that's okay with you. Yeah. Is this for real? I told you I'd fight for Harmony. I'm gonna take that as a yes. It's a yes from me. Yes definitely, definitely yes. Alright. Would you excuse me for a minute? Yeah. Yes! Ben. I was really hoping to storm off in a huff. I'm sorry. Why? You won. It's not about winning. Okay, maybe in the beginning it was about winning. Definitely in the beginning it was about winning. But now it's more about doing what's right for this ranch, and the people, the land. You really sound like Roger. Good job. Thanks. Good luck Ben, I mean that. You do, don't you? Alright, I hope things work out for you. Thank you, you too. I still cannot believe you saved this place. Well you and Taylor are the ones who kept it going long enough for the cavalry to arrive. So what are the cavalry's plans? You heading back to Seattle? Well Roger has a private plan chartered for tomorrow morning so. But I was thinking about staying a little while longer. How much longer? Well I told Roger it might be a good idea, while we get the new division up and running if I stay entrenched in the environment. You know, so I know what I'm talking about. That's a pretty smart idea. You think so. I do, I do. And I think you might need someone, I don't know, who knows the Western lifestyle. Well you may need someone to help out with the horses. It's very true, I happen to know a guy. I know a girl. Does she have any experience? She has potential. When does she start? Right away. Wait, this first lesson doesn't have anything to do with a pitchfork and hay does it? No, but it does involve putting those boots to good use. So did you make a wish? No need.
