We should therefore pray to the Divine Spirit for the grace to be genuinely self-denying, humble, gentle in the service of others, and to have an attitude of brotherly generosity toward them. Oh, Jesus, since you have saved me by the cross, grant that I may ever be willing to live in its practice, that I may die in salvation. I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Without the Way, there is no going. Without the Truth, there is no knowing. Without the Life, there is no living. Amen. If it wasn't for Uncle Ramon, I would not be where I am now. You know, he always told me I could do it. He would always encourage me whenever I felt down. I remember back when I won my first acting award. He was so happy. He's like a father I never had. To a manager, a friend. Rest in peace, Uncle Ramon. You'll forever be in my heart. Ulap. Condolence, Ulap. You don't want to talk to me, do you? Ulap. Who are you looking at? You better finish all that. That's all the food I got left. There you go. Go on. Eat some more. Thank you. Ma'am, buy a sampaguita, please. Please buy all my sampaguita so I can go home. -How much for everything? -Seventy pesos only. That's too much. Thank you. -Now, go. Go home. -Yes, ma'am. Another one. Thanks. Ma'am. We're here, ma'am. Ma'am, we've arrived. Yaya, hurry up. This is it? That's it. We've deducted the money you owed Daddy. Be grateful that you even got paid. So, you'll be looking after me now, right? I don't think so. Bug someone else. Hey, fuck you. What is this? Just because I don't make as much as I used to, you're getting rid of me? Ulap? -Ulap who? That's not Ulap! -How did you get in here? Ulap? Ulap. How did you get here? Hey! Hey! That is not Ulap! -I'm warning you, Jane. -Give me that! What are you saying? That's Ulap! It has a nametag! How would you know? It could be any cat! -You're still denying it! You're a thief. -That's not true. This woman. She's a catnapper. You're a catnapper! -Fine, you can have it. -You're pathetic. -Delete that! -Catnapper! Gosh! Poor Ulap. That girl can't take care of you. Shameless! You trespassing here is shameless! Thief! This sucks! Don't... Don't leave, please. Please don't leave. I can't bear it. It will kill me. I will die. Painfully... and slowly. I can't be without you. Take pity on me, Luis, please. I need you. There's a line before that, right? Lines. "You are my life." Are you for real? Director, I'm really sorry. She's not at her best today. She must not have slept well. Fuck you, Ed. This is the last time. What? You're done, Jane. Thank you. Jane, we're done. We're done. What the heck? She has an attitude. She's really crazy! Hi, big sis! -Hi! -Hi, baby girl! -Oh, my God! -I didn't know you were coming! -Thank you for coming! -Hi, Director! -I saw your story on IG last night. -Oh? You should've come. Jane, you may go. I'm so glad you could make it. Let's do this. Sorry! You look fresh today! I just got out of the gym. Hello? Jane? I'm sorry. They were really looking for someone younger. You didn't know that before you threw me in there? You shithead. Idiot. Here. You're a shithead, too. Do you know that? Guys! We just reached one million followers! And something bigger is coming up so stay tuned, guys! I love you all! Kelly! Kelly! Kelly! One more. Thank you. Sound check. Hey, we're good. Bro, just a sec. Beer. Hi. Hi. Cheers. She can't remember me. I'm surprised, bro. Yeah, I just talked to her last night. For real? Good evening, everyone. Seems like last night! We are the Brisom band. I'm Francis. This here is Mike. Guitars. We've got Wolf on drums. And Tatsi on the keyboards. Tongue is tied I can't talk Legs are tired Can't barely walk Lips so numb Kiss on the wall Heading high I wanna go home All these people around me They come and they go All these people around me They come and they go No, I don't check it, so... So, when you shower, you don't look at it? You just look straight ahead? HEY, KID. I'LL HIT THE BREAKFAST BUFFET. LET'S GO! - FRANCIS Hey, kid. I'm here, you know. Francis? You don't sound so sure. Morning. Come, sit. I don't know what you like so I got a bit of everything. Here. Drink cold water. Takes the edge off. I don't know where you live. So I brought you here. I was pretty wasted myself. You don't remember anything from last night, do you? I knew it. Do you still want to know? Where we first saw each other? How we met? Well, you were drunk, alone. Again. I spoke on the mic and said... This song is for Ms. Jane Pineda, the beautiful lady at the bar. I had a crush on you in high school. Friday Nights was our favorite movie. This song's for you. Hello? No, I'm outside. Where are you? Hello? I told you! No, somebody helped me out. What's your name? -Francis. -Francis. This must be it. So, I got ahead of him this time. I can't have you going home with strangers again. You're jealous so you brought me to a short-stay motel? Why, are you any better? Hey, what short-stay motel? Besides, I'm not like that. I didn't do that. -Didn't do what? What? -You know. That. Besides, you already threw up last night. And I wanted to leave but you no longer wanted me to so I ended up not leaving. I slept on the sofa. Yeah, right. Yes. I thought you had a crush on me? Aren't you Mr. Rockstar? You're the celebrity, right? You should not be the one to believe in stereotypes. You know, you're not the person they say you are. Who are "they?" And what are they saying about me? I'm surprised they're still talking about me. Got a cig? Maybe you should eat something first. My head is killing me. I'm heading back to the room. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, happy birthday Happy birthday to you "As many as six impossible things before breakfast." You bastard! Where are you headed again? I will do what I want. Stay out of it! -I'll drink! -Don't you care about your family? Fuck you. Get back here! Get back here! Dad! Dad! Dad! -Check out, sir? -Check out. Twelve hours, sir. Two thousand, sir. I receive two thousand. What's the plan, kid? I'll drive you home. Where do you live? I don't want to go home yet. What? Let's stay here a bit longer. Huh? Come with me upstairs. Let's have a moment. What do you mean? -You have a pool, right? -Yes, ma'am. What kind of additional charge for another 12 hours? Additional two thousand, sir. Okay. We're going up now. Bye. This looks so good on me, see? Imagine it. Pretty, right? This will look good on you. -No, no. -Just look at it. Buy this. So we'll have a matching set. See? Look. It's so nice. Yes? What are you looking at? Does this look good on you? Ma'am Jane, can I have a picture with you? Is it okay with you? I'll do it. Jeez. Can't you see we were talking? That will do. We're taking this. Give me your shorts, hurry up. -Charge it to our room. -Okay. That looks good on you! You're slaying that pineapple print. Come closer. Let me see. Take that off. Let me see. This? Yes! You want to remove the shorts? Show me! Wow! A tattoo! Turn around. He's got abs! Why are you covering it? Let me look at you. Let me see. Whoa! He's got abs! It really suits you. What took you so long? I've been waiting. I did a few push-ups. You did? Where? In the bathroom. Okay. Come on. Let's swim. What? You'll just stay there? What are you waiting for? Come on! Let's go! You really do have a crush on me, huh? You have a crush on me. That's fine. I knew it. You totally do. Hey! Come here! Come here! I'm coming. -Want another kiss? -Of course! Never! It's cool you get to have this time off. We have a gig, actually. But I told the band I'm not good for it. It's okay. Nobody comes to see us play anyway. What's the matter with you? You'll get your break. What you need is one hit. Nah, we're too old anyway. Life's passed us by. It's cool, silly. I know that I'm a has-been. And they're right. I blew my chances. But you're still in the game. Right? You're a good actress. I'm just dancing! That's enough, ma'am. -Ma'am, you're drunk. -I just wanna dance! You're drunk, ma'am. Ma'am, you've had enough. Boss. Boss. Let me. Hi. Look, they finished the whole bottle. -You! -I just wanted to dance. I can't believe you didn't invite me. I was just dancing and they wanted me to stop. Go on then. Just dance. -My bangles fell off. -Bangles? Nice bangles, huh? On your feet. All right, let's dance. No. I want to dance here. All right, on your feet, then. I don't want to. Do you know how to dance? Like this? Like this? Oops! All right... like that? Okay. Come on, dance! I am! I'm dancing. Come on, stand up first. -Like that? -Like this. -Just dance. -Yes, let's dance. Dance. Yeah, I'm dancing. Thank you. Thank you more. Can I see you again? Depends if I'm feeling crazy. I wish you'd feel crazy all the time. Yeah? You mean that? -Can you live with that? -Yes. You're just saying that. I can live with that. Really? What? Nothing. Where have you been, huh? Nowhere. Here and there. You're not answering my calls. Why? When I'm calling you, you should answer. Immediately. Do you understand? What do you want? You want this? You like that? -Wardrobe, are you done? -Yes, Miss. All right. Ms. Jane? Please sit over here. Thank you. Okay, ready? Jump in. Where are you heading? Poblacion. All right. You, guys! This is so gonna be fun! It's gonna be so lit! Look at this place! Oh, my God. This is gonna be lit! -Are you still with Ms. K? Kelly! -Come on, guys! -God, get a room! Have more drinks! -Kelly? Kelly! Kelly, are you still with Ms. K? Watch it. She is super strict. A control freak. Don't ask me about her. -Guys, drink. -No, 'cause I don't have a manager now so I was thinking I could sign with her. You know what? Just keep drinking, okay? Let's party! Kelly. Hey! Kelly, wake up. -We're leaving. -Ma'am, excuse me. Here's your bill. What's this? 13,000? I'm not paying for that. -But, ma'am, you ordered all that. -Me? I didn't order anything. Ma'am, I can't pay for all these. That should do it. Come on. Get up. Come, time to go home. You're going to hurt yourself. Get up. Hey! Kelly! Kelly! Hey! -What do you have there? -Huh? A kid. Time to go. Up! One, two, three! There we go. Good on you. I was expecting you'd be the one in that state. As if. Fuck you. Whoever you are. Fuck you. What are we going to do with her? Let's take your car. -Didn't she bring a driver? -No, she just sneaked out, for sure. Please sign here. All right, hold on. Oops. Kelly, give me your hand. Let me. Give me your hand, Kelly. Your hand, hurry. Autograph. There we go. -Mister. -Thank you. Okay. One, two, three. Up! -Whoa! -Oops! Okay. Ouch, I hit my head. Yummy? Yummy. Oh! Bacon! Bacon! -Bacon, bacon! -Let's eat. Sit there. Smells so good. What are you doing? Are you just going to sniff it? -I can't do bacon, I can't do it. -Go on, you're eating. Sit down. Hey! Is that my phone? Where's my phone? She just sniffed the bacon. -Just sniffed? -Yeah. Hello? Yes, Ms. K. Good morning! Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry, Ms. K! I'm so sorry! I'm on my way, yes. Yeah. I already called the driver. Yes. I'm so sorry, Ms. K. I love you, I love you. Bye. Okay. Big sis, where's the bathroom? -Go there, then turn left. -Okay. Want rice? You think I'm like Kelly? What, self-absorbed? Of course. You think so? No. You know what's so good about you? You don't know that you're good. That you're very good. Best compliment ever. Hey. Come to our gig tomorrow, okay? I'll see. I have to do something in Bulacan. What are you gonna do there? Ribbon-cutting... of a salon. Jane. I was in the area and I thought I'd drop by. Hi, Mom. Come, eat. I'm okay, I'm full. Thank you. What are you working on right now? I have an indie film. And some acting bits here and there. I couldn't make it to your uncle Ramon's funeral. Things are so busy around here. Miles got sick, too. And your uncle George has to be looked after. We've got our hands full at the restaurant with a new branch opening soon. What great fun you're having. Maybe you could invite me to do your ribbon-cutting. Sure. I'll tell them. How much is your talent fee now? Jane. Jane? How much do you need this time? I don't know what else I can do for you. Would you like to come live here? You're welcome to move in anytime. Are you still happy with what you're doing? What do you want to do? Do you want to die? You want to follow your father? What do you want to do? I want to go home now. I don't know why I even came here. Jane! Both of us are just trying to fix our lives! Run, we're leaving this town When we come this way I'm lighting up our way I, I'm waking alive I'm falling deeper into I'm coming after you When all the light and hope is gone And no one else to carry on I'm here I'm here The picture's gone and I can't see You turn into reality Hold on For now Maybe you'll stay Maybe you'll go I'm walking through that door There's nothing I want more Is there something left for us to be The stars are gone and no one's here The falling shapes, the shadows know They're lost Maybe you'll stay Maybe you'll go I'm walking through that door There's nothing I want more Kid, you were being careless again. I stood you up. I'm sorry. That's okay. It's not okay. Too bad. You didn't hear the song I wrote for you. -You wrote a song for me? -Yes. Sorry. It's okay. I love you, so... it's okay. Hey, don't think you have to answer. You don't have to do anything. I just want you to know. That's all. Just let me. Whoa, he's so pretty! Where did you steal this from? What are you talking about? -Where did you steal him? -I didn't steal it. I got it for you. Come on! -What? -Just tell me where you stole it. If you don't want it, I'll just return him. Mine. It's mine now. Come over here. What was his old name? I don't know. Just give him a new one. A new one. You will be Fat Cat. You like that, Fat Cat? Just don't post pictures of it online. See. You did steal it. Hi, Fatty. You're Fat Cat now. Hi, Fatty. You're Fat Cat now. -So cute. -Hi, Fatty. Let me look at you. -Cool. -Knock, knock! Hi, guys! I brought beers. Let's drink! Hi! I brought beer. Can you hear me? -Yes! -Hi. -And food! -All right! So sweet! Come on, let's get to work. This tastes so good. Thank you. You've been thanking me since I got here. I just gave you a burger. What if I gave you my heart? Hold on. I got butterflies in my tummy. -Give me a sec. -Nutjob. Let me savor this moment. Shut up! I'm glad you're making an album. Not an album, just a single. Like you said. We might get lucky. We stumbled upon a label looking for fresh talents. Do we look fresh to you? We're classic-- Stop that. You always do that. Ever heard of "six things you can believe before breakfast?" Alice in Wonderland? Me and my Dad, that's our favorite book. It could be my favorite childhood memory. Us, reading that book and listing six impossible things. All right, let's hear your six impossible things. Okay. Number one. You can be anyone you wanna be and you can do anything you want to do. So I think that song you're recording will hit number one. I'm sure. It does sound impossible. -But fine, sure. -Don't jinx it. Just believe it because I said so. -If I say it, it's true. -Okay. Number two. My liver can take all the alcohol in the world. My dad and I agreed on it. It was on his list, too. Now he's dead. Number three. Penguins live forever. And number four, I was a penguin in my past life. -Possibly. -Can you see it? Show me again? How? Nice. Cute. Penguins aren't like that. They go like this. -You're making fun of me. -Ouch! -You're mean. -No, I'm enjoying this. Five? Five? Stolen kisses and 3:00 a.m. conversations. -What was that? -Now it's possible! It's still 1:00 a.m.! Let me see. Show me. -See, it's still one o'clock. -Just two hours to go. -At least we made one possible. -It's 1:00 a.m.! One of your six impossible things came true. -You kiss thief! -You liked it, didn't you? Didn't you? You're so annoying. Anyway, that was five, right? What's the sixth? Love is always the answer. See that, kid? I'm not the only one who's corny. Give my kiss back! You kiss thief! It was good though. -Kiss me again at 3:00 a.m. -All right. From Ms. K, "Do well in your shoot, kid. Break a leg!" Nice! There it is. Where's the location? Subic. Must be why I've got an early call time. 6:00 a.m. But my pullout's at 3:00 p.m. I'll go with the service van. Awesome. Do your best, okay? Of course, I'll do a great job. Hah! Want me to pick you up? Ah, can't. We have a gig. No, don't worry about me. If it's out of town, they give me my own service so they can keep me for as long as it takes then just drive me home. Okay. Boyet, save it for later. Okay. In a bit, she'll be coming from over there then she'll walk towards you. -Director, actors in. -Okay! Mark! Isn't that for me? Yes, mix the cauldron with it. Go over there. Now, then... Can you make it quick? It's so hot. We've been here for ages. What's so difficult? Can you hurry? Don't you want to head home? I can't wait to get home. -"Can't wait to get a drink," you mean. -What? What did he say? Hey, what did you say? Hey! What did you say? I'm talking to you. What did you say? Tell me what you just said! If you have something to say, say it to my face. What did you say? What? What did you say? You were acting like a hard-ass just now. Huh? The hell is this? You're all packed up? No one even came to check if I was done with this? What? Fuck your crew! What the fuck are you writing, huh? Fuck you. Why did you call me here at 6:00? You fuckhead. Are you recording this? Huh? See this? Delete that video or you won't see me next shoot! Is that clear? Come on! Do it. Just once. Do this with your hands. Please. That's what I did at work earlier. They were applauding. I did so good. You didn't see because I was calling you. You weren't picking up. We got pushed behind in the lineup and one band ran late. I thought you stopped drinking. Huh? Hey, if you saw what they made me wear back there, with that thing on my face. It was so hot and itchy and the... The thing... They didn't know what they were doing. If you were there, you'd want to drink too. And besides, I did try. Whatever. Why did we stop? No reason. Just having a cigarette break. Come on, kid. Get in. You're out of the movie, Jane. They didn't appreciate you lashing out on set. I don't like your attitude. You should know better, Jane. If not for Kelly, I wouldn't have taken you in. What you need is rehab. I'll refer you to my friends in Tagaytay. Okay? I have to go. They're waiting for me. So hard to work with! Sounds really nice. And look! It has 1,200 streams already, and it'll still go up for sure. Hope so. It has been three weeks. Thank you for this. It's so good. By the way, how did your meeting go? Really great. -Really? -Yes. Ms. K said we got plenty of inquiries from production companies. They're considering me. So they're going to send the script and we can read it together at home. If it's good, then I'll do it. I'd like that. Yes! High five! You just pluck the leaves off like this. You do it. It's not hard. Never mind, I'll always cook for you. -Hold on. -Okay. Hello? Jane. Long time no see. Yeah, I know. I got sick. I heard you have a boyfriend now. No, nothing like that. So what is he? Just for playtime? You have play things, too. Don't play that game on me, Jane, huh? Come down here. I'll come and get you. Jane? Where are you going? I'm buying cigs. Jane. Come on. You bitch! What now? What's your problem? Does your boyfriend know you're crazy? Does he? You destroy people's lives. Do you remember what you did to Sam? Jane, what can you say about your leaked sex tape with Sam? Is it true that you two are over? How did you react when he left you despite all the issues? Jane, have you met with Sam? Have you talked on the phone? Is it true that you were pulled out because of misconduct? You don't have a taping! -I said stop! -I already spoke to her! Where were you? Why did you leave? Your car wasn't at home. Fuck! Where were you! What? -Jane! -Get back here! Jane! ONE DAY, YOU WILL LOVE ME, TOO. I KNOW I'M CORNY. -FRANCIS Hey, kid. You're back. Want me to reheat the stew? Okay. Kid? What's the matter? Kid, say something. What happened? It's so good. -Let's go upstairs. -Let's go. -Come on. Let's go. -Come here. -Come on. -Can we just go upstairs? I promise you'll have a good time upstairs. -Come into the water. -Actually, not upstairs. Downstairs. Let's go. Come on, Kelly. Kelly, can you just come with me, please? I swear, just-- Hey. Jane, baby. What's up? Glad you took my invitation. Stop it. What's wrong? I just came to tell you this is the last time. I can't see you anymore. Francis and I are serious. Oh, yeah? Serious, huh. You? You're gonna be with that fucking loser? Is that okay? You think that's gonna be okay? You think you can handle your life now? Nobody's gonna hire you anymore. I always have something to offer you and you love it. Go ahead. Don't you ever call me again. You bitch! Jane, you will amount to nothing. Jane! You are useless! Jane! Hey, Kelly! Kelly, where do you think you're going? Kelly, come back here. -Come back here! -Jane. Fuck you two! I saw that. Jane. You look at me like I did something wrong to you. You know he has a girlfriend, right? But that's just for show. And you knew that too. But still, you let him play you. Way to go, big sis. I'm just looking out for you. Don't be like me. Kelly, you still have so much to accomplish. Trust me, I've been there. What the fuck? Whatever happened to you won't happen to me, okay? You did that to yourself, girl. So stop blaming it on other people. Hey, kid. What's the problem? Geez, I'm not all problems. It's nothing. Come eat at my place later. Let's have dinner. Wow! Really? You cooked? No, are you crazy? I'll have food delivered. All right. I'll skip lunch so I'll drop in starving. All right. I love you. I love you, too. Okay. See you. Okay. See you. Bye. -Hi. -Hi. Thank you! Look at this. Impressive! It's a good selection, isn't it? This is so good! So I thought, "Who would be great company over dinner?" -"Francis!" -Quick thinking. Because you didn't do the cooking... You only get a kiss on the cheek. You're corny! Cook, so you get a kiss on the lips! Come on, eat! -Smile! -That's enough, Mom. Hey, Francis. Come over here. Join us. All right, smile! Girls, come here with us. Join us. Come, we have a celebrity with us. Francis hit the jackpot! We're with a movie star! Jane, come drink with us! Juice? I was thinking of looking for a job. PR or marketing in Singapore. Really? Don't you need a degree for that? It's an advantage but not a requirement. Besides, I found online courses for P.R. Some companies will even train you. Are you ready for that? What I mean is... What I mean is... Things just happened recently... -And you're still-- -I can do it. Don't you think it's better if you checked into rehab first? Maybe that's better, just so you could say you're much more stable already. Better than rushing into a job. Besides, Singapore's too far. What do you mean "stable?" Between the two of us, you're the one without a stable job. And it's only Singapore. It's practically next door. Sam. Jane. How've you been? They say people drink alcohol when they want to forget something or when they want to celebrate. As for me, I want to celebrate this. This moment. Damn, we're back together! And it's almost Christmas. Merry Christmas! Dumbass. It's still August. We're not yet even in October. So? Well, then... Fuck... Merry... Merry August twenty-fuck-whatever-shit. I finally said, "I love you." Is that something I should celebrate or forget about? You really love him? He's lucky. Maybe not. You should know. You would know. I hope it's not too late, but... I want to apologize. I'm sorry if I fed you to the wolves back then. I'm sorry, too. For everything. So what's your plan? Are you staying here or will you go back to the US? Or... Nah. I'm divorced, she took the kids, so... Yeah. I guess this is all I have. What about you? Got a movie? I got nothing. I'm tired anyway. I'm sick of running. I'm sick of chasing after things that were never meant for me, anyway. You know, the two of us... We're not completely useless to the society. We are the warning signs. We are the stories that people tell themselves to... To console themselves that they didn't become the people like us. So they can enjoy their fucking pretty lives. What's pissing you off? This! -Then, smash it! Wreck it! -Hello! That's it! Fucking demon! Yes! That's it! That's right! If you're mad, smash things! Smash whatever pisses you off! Right, move around. -You're mad. -Hey! He's mad, too! -You troublemakers! -You're mad too, aren't you? You're mad? Then smash it more! -Drop that! -Give me that! Fuck you two! That's my car! Hey, you're angry, too. -Hey, wait. -Give me that! Hey, that's a girl. You're too serious, man! Jeez, this huffy can't take a joke! Drop that bat! Fuck you two! -Mister! Mister! -Why are you so huffy, man? What now? What the fuck! Fuck, what? I'll pay. How much is that shit? You look broke, dumb fuck! Dumb fuck, huh? -Come back here! -Fuck you! What are you... What are you thinking? Are you thinking about me? Because I'm right here. You can talk to me. If you're angry, tell me. You haven't said a word since you picked me up. Please talk to me. Hey. Jane. I know I'm a nobody. I know I can't give you everything you want. Or whatever it is you're looking for. I don't have all the answers you need. I don't know how to melt your anger. Do you know what I can do? All I can do, Jane, is love you, take you in my arms. I want to be beside you the moment you call for me. I want to see you smiling whenever you're with me. I want to love you every day, Jane. But it's beginning to weigh on me. I'm running out of ways to love you. I can't just love you. And turn a blind eye. You need help, Jane. And it isn't me. I don't want to give up on you. But it's hurting me, too. I started drinking at nine years old. There was a party at our house. My dad was an alcoholic and I took a sip. I felt safe. Because my daddy was there. Besides, doesn't it feel nice to be at the adults' table when you're a kid? Then, my Daddy died. I can't remember, but I know Mommy couldn't stop crying. Whereas I... It seemed like I couldn't feel anything. Or I guess I really don't remember. But I remember telling myself I won't die like how Daddy died. I went into acting at ten years old. It's the only thing I know... acting. I acted in everything. It's exhausting, especially for a kid. They didn't know I was drinking. I'd drink whenever I was exhausted or sleepless. I would drink when I was sad or happy. I'd drink when there were crowds. I'd sneak when nobody's looking. I would drink when a rumor blew up, I'd drink when everything became a mess. I would drink so I wouldn't feel anything, then I would keep drinking so I could feel something again. Every single day. It wears you out. Alcohol was my... friend, my only friend. Only friend. And then I made alcohol my... My shield and my weapon. It's shameful. I'd usually black out. So I wouldn't remember anything and later I'd find out I'd been causing other people trouble. I leaned on someone who was worse than myself. I'd just say to myself, "Well, at least I'm not as bad as he is." It's humiliating. So, that's how it was... I used alcohol for everything. Alcohol made me fearless. So fearless I could face anything on my own. So fearless I no longer knew how to love and how to handle the love given to me. You've been waiting for a while. No, not too long. You're so early. How are you, kid? Ouch! Ouch, you're going to kill me with that hug. -I missed you so much. -Really? Give me a kiss! Where's Fat Cat? He's in there. Oh, no! He must have jumped out! Where is Fat Cat? He's with your Mom. He's been looking for you. Really? He told you? Yes. He said, "Meow, meow." All right, let's hit it. We need to beat the traffic. Let's go. Where are we going? Let's go to your Mom's, and spend Christmas Eve there. Then, we'll head back to the condo tomorrow. So I'll have you all to myself. -Christmas Eve at Mom's house? -Yes. Come again? What did you say? So you can what? Have you all to myself. Come on! That's intense. -You hungry? -Totally. Let's eat. What do you want to eat? Kiss. -Anything. Everything! -Okay. How long can you stay out? Until New Year? I can stay until the sixth, actually. Then I need to head back here. I'll drive you back here, okay? Sure, if I get crazy again. Kidding! Thank you! Thank me? It comes with a price! What's the price, then? Your love.
