1953, WARSAW PRISON INTERROGATION OF BISHOP BARANIAK Good morning! Wake up! How are you, dear bishop? Give me anything. You can even lie. As you wish. Alfred! Manicure! IN 1945 THE USA, GREAT BRITAIN AND THE USSR PLACED POLAND UNDER SOVIET INFLUENCE. THIS LED TO PERSECUTION, ARRESTS, TORTURE AND MURDERS OF POLISH ANTI-COMMUNISTS. THE CHURCH WAS ALSO TARGETED. ON 25 SEPTEMBER 1953 THE POLISH PRIMATE CARDINAL STEFAN WYSZYŃSKI WAS INTERNED. 28 OCTOBER 1956, KOMAŃCZA Marian? Next time, we should take a tractor… comrade. Good morning. We'd like to see the priest. I cannot accept that. Hello? This is Komańcza. Connecting with Warsaw. You may continue your call. He demands the re-institution of Catholic publishing. The removal of our high-ranking church officials in Wrocław and Katowice. What else does he want? One more thing. The government can't meddle with clergy placement. And that the church and state commission continues its work. The re-instatement of bishop Adamski from Katowice and the imprisoned bishop Kaczmarek from Kielce and the suffragan bishops from Gniezno. Tell him this. Understood. Certainly. We're to accept his terms. Komańcza, Sisters of Nazareth convent Primate's place of internment Is that all? Just a few more things. I left them by the door. Good morning. Bishop Choromański will be here soon. I wasn't expecting you to accompany me during my trip. I can't let you visit Częstochowa. There's heavy fog. I thought this was agreed upon! It was agreed that you'll be in Warsaw today. SEPTEMBER 1939, DĘBLIN GERMAN BOMBARDMENT I can't take it anymore! I want to die! You want to live! Get down! Get down! We need to sow. Otherwise only wasteland will remain. PROPHET Sister Maksancja! - Can I do anything? - Pray for his safe return. Flowers are in the kitchen. - That was a close call. - I'm sorry. I'm here for the flowers. No flowers here. Stasio has vanished. There's no flowers, no fatback, no eggs. Enough of the grating. - What are you ranting about, sister? - There you are, Stasio! I brought everything. Put them in water. It's flickering again. How can Holy Virgin Mary let this happen? Is it going to be fixed? - Where were you so long? - What do you think? Your shopping list was miles long. I had to drive halfway across town to get it all. - I wish to taste these delicacies. - No. The primate loves his hash browns. I'm making them just for him. All right, just kidding. - Me too. - God bless, sister. God bless. 28 OCTOBER 1956, WARSAW My feet got cold from all the waiting. - You should've worn two pairs of socks. - If I had them, I would. - Stop it. - Move. Want to go to the station? There you go. Move back, gentlemen. It's our spot. - We're from the Polish Newsreel. - Buzz off. Move it! - Give us a second. - Quickly. Perfect. Łysy! Set it up here. Don't stand in front of the camera. Move aside. That's right. Come on! I can't film at this angle. Don't get cocky. Stand on tiptoes. I asked you not to stand in front of the camera. Move aside. Excuse me! There's always place for a set of legs like yours! - I wanted to say goodbye. - There's no need. God bless. Mission accomplished. This is just the beginning. Baca, you little rascal. Come here! Good dog. Antoni. - My dearest "Eights"! - Finally! Hello, Marysia. Be careful. You'll knock me down! - I'm glad to see you. - We've been waiting. I'm so happy to be home at last. Finally. Hello to you all. Pretty pictures. Too pretty for our taste. I haven't seen you before. It's my first time here. You're an artist? Cut out the praying and edit the Newsreel. Hold on a second. There'll be nothing left. That's the point. You catch on quickly. We'll be seeing each other more often. Janek, right? Yes. Janek. People are becoming anxious. Because of the upcoming general election. There is a threat that many citizens will boycott it to express their discontent with the people's government. We need an organization of public trust, the Catholic Church, to convince the people to participate in the election. The Catholic Church doesn't support the People's Republic of Poland. Priests often endorse opposition activities. They provide places to meet, and printing presses. That is why I was against releasing the primate and bringing him back to Warsaw. I have to disagree with you, Prime Minister. Evidently, the isolation of the manager of the Catholic Church wasn't popular among the people. That is why I decided to bring him back to Warsaw. I intend to convince him to collaborate with the people's government. - The primate… - The manager of the church! He is known for being stubbornly wrapped up in his beliefs. We relocated him to Komańcza, because even the extreme measures in other prisons hadn't broken him. He almost died in there, so why would he suddenly change his mind? You will persuade him. - Me? - Yes. You'll make some concessions to convince him we'll stop putting pressure on the church. But only if he agrees to prompt the citizens to vote during the election. Someone has to make him an offer. It shouldn't be me. I'm truly sorry, Antoni. No need. You've taken on the burden of the primate of Poland. I couldn't sink that low. I'm in your debt, Antoni. So is the Polish church. If they'd broken you, it would've been like Hungary or Czechoslovakia. By the grace of God, we both survived. There's a reason. What do you mean? The fate of communism will be decided in Poland. We must prepare the nation for its spiritual and moral revival. What's the plan? The millennium of the Baptism of Poland is coming up. Nine years of preparations to the celebrations should radically transform our country. If Poland becomes more Christian, it will become a major moral force. And communism will fail on its own. We don't need heroic deaths in the name of love, but we rather need heroic work for the sake of our beloved homeland. I really want this to take root in the soul of each of you, like a seed in the ground. It must grow and bear fruit a hundredfold. This fruit will be peace. - I'm in a hurry. - I wanted to… - What are you doing? - Just a second. - Let me go, please. - I just wanted a hug! Come in. Primate, the electrician's here. It's so good you're here. Look at this. There are outages in Warsaw today. I'll take care of it. I like to be up to date. Don't you? It's always good to have a newspaper handy. I haven't read in a while. I need to catch up. When I'm done, you'll be able to read to your heart's content, primate. Excuse me, but the postman was here and he left you some mail. Dear primate, please join me in my office on 14 January 1957 at 9 AM. Best regards, Józef Cyrankiewicz Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Poland. It seems to be bigger issue. - I have to check other rooms as well. - Certainly, go ahead. - My regards. - Thank you. Christmas Eve 1956 COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE Fear not; for, behold, I bring you a gospel of great joy, which shall be to all people. Today, in the city of David, a saviour has been born for you. He is the Messiah… Fellow citizens! While sharing the wafer on Christmas Eve, I wish you strength in virtues of faith, hope, and love. And that you manage to overcome anything and everything that divides you or makes you suspicious of one another. Your brother and pastor, primate of Poland. Damn him. Does he speak this way off the cuff? He spoke so well. Thanks to us the whole nation heard him. The church hasn't had this much liberty since the war. But the broadcast was a bit too much. Józef? When are you meeting him? In three weeks. Come in. May I leave, first secretary? - It's Christmas. My kids are waiting. - Yes, certainly. You can go. All the best. All of you go. I wish to assure you, we do not celebrate Catholic holidays, first secretary. Understandable. But Christmas is also a Polish tradition. All the best. I'll also get going. Józef? Make sure the manager of the church supports the election. Postcards and letters. A card from Komańcza. - The sisters miss me? - No, it's from the post office. They wish us prosperity and God's love. A card from Magda's parents, from the seaside. How is her father doing? Not a word about it, but they wish you good health, father. From the USA. This one's from Spain. BEST WISHES FOR THE NEW YEAR Who sent that one? 14 JANUARY 1957 CHANCELLERY OF POLAND - God bless. - Thank you. You, too. This way. The Prime Minister is expecting you. You have to admit, your Eminence, that things are better now. The joint state-church commission was formed. We voided the state's right to appoint religious officials. As of December last year. The agreement hasn't been made public yet. It's 1957 for two weeks on the dot. Speaking of it, I just remembered the main issue. And what in return? A fruitful collaboration. The text of the agreement will be published in the Polish Gazette. Possibly even before 20 January. So it's about the election. There's a chance for change. All it takes is a gentle nudge. In the right direction. The primate can't be campaigning for the government. Who's talking about campaigning? It is merely to inform the nation about its civic duties. Listen, please. It is unacceptable that the representatives of the church are subject of cruel interrogations. Bishop Kaczmarek and bishop Baraniak being prominent examples. Nothing will ever bring their health back. I also want guaranteed freedom of religious publishing. Think about that. I will consider your offer. That is just the tip of the iceberg. Communists can't be trusted. Yes, I know. However, we need an agreement. They'll wait for an opening and strike. They won't even consider our demands. Maybe so. But for now, I must protect the church. In its letter to believers, the Polish episcopate formally encourages to vote. The contents of the letter are as follows: Sunday, 20 January is the day of a general election in Poland. Catholic citizens are to fulfil their consciences' duty and take part in the election. The Catholic clergy will adapt the mass schedule so every churchgoer will be able to fulfil their religious and political obligations. So the prime minister successfully managed to sway the manager. He shouldn't have mentioned the masses. Just tell them to vote. To make things right, everything should be manually controlled. To make things right, we'd need to clone you, first secretary, and place a copy by every clerks' side. Right. Stop the car! You little thief! Leave her be! She's stealing from me and lying! Takes a thief to know one! I know you scammed our neighbour on sugar! Wasn't the first time! - You vermin! - Calm down. I'll pay. This has happened before. There you go. I should drag you to the police, you slut! You're lucky the priest saved you! Would you like an apple? - It's stolen. - God shares his gifts unevenly. One gets a chicken, the other gets an egg. - What's your name? - Kazia. Listen to me, child. If you ever need anything, come to the presbytery on Miodowa Street and ask. I don't like to owe anything. You really never had tea with sugar? I don't like sugar. Come in! Sorry to interrupt. - Good night, primate. - Good night. - Good night, bishop. - I will also get going. Good night. Good night, Antoni. Good night. He'll return to Czechoslovakia the same way he came here. - Meaning? - With a backpack and a girl. SECRET CONSECRATION OF A CZECHOSLOVAKIAN CLERIC It's good they haven't prohibited ordaining priests in Poland. Yet. I'm truly grateful, primate. I didn't think it would work. I'm glad, too. Remember to be discreet. Of course. I won't even tell my mother. Let's keep it that way. Everything will be fine. - Godspeed. - God bless. - Father! - Wait, Stasio. Father! - The list of parishes. - Thank you, Marysia. Be careful, father. Let's go. 1 MAY 1957, WARSAW COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE Comrade secretary! Yes! Yes, indeed. I agree with you, primate. I think you believe in your ideas. And I respect your pursuit of a relative independence for Poland. I appreciate the changes which have taken place since October. I trust they are permanent. We have to live side by side for a very long time. Now that is in God's hands. It would be beneficial to establish our relations rather permanently. There are still too many unresolved issues to talk about the concordat. Speak. Please. One of them is the matter of independent religious publications. We encouraged people to vote and you don't allow them to work. We have considered it. Unfortunately, we can't agree to that yet. What about new churches? All over Poland priests are struggling with obtaining building permits for new churches. There are too many of them in the country. I can give permission to store the Holy Sacrament in private houses. You know what it'd mean. Millions of churches. Fine. I'll have people look into the matter. I trust it'll be done efficiently. There's also the issue of the Caritas. - Your priests run it. - But it's you who appoint them. I want to make sure that the church in Poland can operate freely. Only this can be the basis of a permanent agreement. Naturally. But, please, do remember that the People's Republic of Poland is an independent, sovereign country which is building socialism. And only with this state you could possibly consider signing the concordat. Socialism in Poland has its peculiarities. We both understand it. Our beliefs divide us but we both need an agreement for the good of our nation. As you are certainly aware, I'm leaving for Rome in a few days. I'm going to highlight our situation to the pope. Magnificent. I'd like to offer you a luxury carriage. You'll be more comfortable. An engineering miracle. Miracle is a bit much, don't you think? This luxury car highlights the socialist equality of all people. I agree. Nonetheless, it is comfortable. Watch your legs. I brought two copies of Black Madonna of Częstochowa. One is for the pope. Fortunately, I have short legs. The paintings are safe. Plovers flew by. Fascinating birds. They pretend to be injured and move away from their nest. A predator follows, but when they are sufficiently far away from the nest, they just fly away. Do we know the plan of the presentation of the cardinal's insignia? We do. Let's dine. Thank you. You will finally be a full-fledged cardinal, primate. I already am, Zygmunt. Consistently. I am a cardinal. Consistently. 18 MAY 1957, THE VATICAN PRESENTATION OF CARDINAL'S INSIGNIA Read. "Holy Mother with the Child on your hand whose likeness - hangs in every Polish home". - Next. "Our Lady of Częstochowa, revered in countless wayside shrines, be our guidance - and relief". - Now you. "Mother of our nation, whose image is - a sign of unity and Polish identity". - Enough! Why don't you explain to me why such atrocities are available in churches? It's sheer fanaticism. It implies that people are oppressed and ignores the progress taking place in the People's Republic of Poland. We gave them a finger, they took the whole hand. And I gave him my luxury carriage… 17 JUNE 1957, WARSAW - Welcome! - Thank you. - God bless. - Welcome home! God bless you all. Good morning. Thank you. - Thank you. Hello. - It's for you, your Excellency. Shouldn't you go home, child? That's not very nice. Kazia? My mum needs a priest. - Praise the Lord. - Now and forever. Christ, it's the… Hey mister! Are you here - to read her the last rites? - Shut it! Are you brain-dead? He's a priest! Don't call him mister! It's fine. Father! Kazia, give us a minute. She's a good kid. And quite strong willed. Where the illegal leaflets are coming from? We seized all illegal copy machines. What about the church? They still have theirs. Confiscate them! As long as there's even one duplicator working in this country, you lose the right to a good night's sleep. 4 JULY 1958, WARSAW WARSAW CURIA Praised be our Lord. I'm here to see the primate. Where's your cassock? It's in my backpack. - In your backpack? - Yes. Follow me. The cassock needs ironing. His Excellency awaits a priest. - Praised be the Lord. - Now and forever. I'm glad you're finally here. You had to put your vacation on hold. It's all right. I suppose the matter is urgent. I summoned you here to inform you that Pope Pius XII appointed you an auxiliary bishop of Cracow. - Me? - Father Karol Wojtyła, is it? - Yes. It's me. - Everything's in order, then. Here's your nomination. What will be your first step? I wasn't expecting this. I planned to go kayaking for two more weeks. - I'm going back to the youth. - Good call. - Blessings in your new ministry. - Thank you. - Godspeed. - God bless. Bless you, Haven't you noticed that it's raining? I'm not made of sugar. God willing. You're just like my Janek, father. He takes marvellous photos but he can't unfold an umbrella. I just forgot one. Is something wrong? We're trying to get pregnant. That's wonderful. Children are the most precious gift. Well, yes, but we've been trying for a long time now. God has his plans. Easy to say. I'm afraid that I can never be a mother. Whenever God challenges us with hardships, it's only to make us appreciate the good that comes after. Trust him. Entrust yourself to Our Lady. Alright, I need to go. Lately, Janek has lost himself in the work. Maybe he has lots of it. Bloody hell! - Hello? - Watch your tone! - Has he left? - Give me a second. No. He's discussing plans. What fucking plans? Hold on. They will be travelling on back roads. They're getting ready. They're transporting packages. I went to the shoe shop you recommended. The saleswoman brings me a pair of shoes. I picked ones with heels. I have to wear higher heels to balance out my round face. - A round face? Nonsense! - I do. Never mind. I was trying on the shoes and I noticed that one was too tight. So I told her. She says it's impossible. And claimed that my feet are uneven. - You're kidding? - That's what she said. Can you imagine? What a mean woman. How can anyone say something like that? If it was true, it would make a customer quite upset. You're right. It was rude. I'll find a new shoe shop. Don't worry. I shouldn't have sent you there. I've never heard anything bad about them. Father. Papers. You know who we are. Papers. Where are the packages? What packages? Show it. Pastries. It's just pastries. Pastries! It's just pastries. I wonder what you would've said at gunpoint. Did you see his expression, father? He wanted to just vanish. Don't laugh. It's his job. Someone must've given him a fake tip. Yeah, right. You'll soon play the devil's advocate, father! Pastries! Just pastries! Good afternoon. How can I help you? JULY 1958, CZĘSTOCHOWA PRIMATE INSTITUTE Duplicators. The Spirit of Human Labour. Seize it. - On what basis? - What are you doing? - Please, wait! - Shut up! Hands off! Halina! Let me take a look. What are you doing? Halina. Stay still. She broke her arm. Thank you. How did it go? Half a second faster than yesterday. Not that! I'm asking about the joint committee. There seem to be some discrepancies. We're still gathering information about members of the episcopate. I need more time. All according to plan. Towel! They want to turn people into fanatics, but I won't let that happen! Poland is a sovereign, socialist country.. God has no place in it. I want to meet him. Comrade first secretary, the primate is on his way. The manager of the episcopate. Gentlemen, wait in the debate chamber. The fact that until now I haven't mentioned my personal harm, doesn't mean it's forgotten. If you plan on reverting to allegations, I'll be forced to accuse you first and demand public reparations. It would incriminate you in the nation's eyes and the world's. We brought you to Warsaw. We showed our good will in the relations between the state and the church. Meanwhile, we received news that you are engaging in anti-state activities. Your informants are wrong. The Catholic church is a pastoral and charity organization. What about rival celebrations? Certainly. I'm arranging commemorations of the Millennium of the Baptism of Poland. We are not rivalling anything. Our goal is the spiritual renewal of the nation. The celebration of the Millennium should help increase the nation's strength to build socialism. It must unite the citizens of the People's Republic of Poland. The issue is the People's Party's agenda is anti-religious. It doesn't pay attention to the history, tradition, and the nation's inclinations. We need progress, not your spiritual renewal. From what I've heard, it is supposed to last for nine years. Progress? What about international aid? Ships from the USA are moored by Gdynia, waiting. What's your endgame? To starve your already poor population just because the Americans gave those donations to the church? No, that's not the reason at all. The Catholics also must pay their tariffs. A socialist country is a country where everyone is equal before the law. Besides, support from the West for the manager of the church can be interpreted as an attempt at pulling Poland out of the socialist block. The blockage of the aid doesn't target me, but the people. Isn't the well-being of the people important to the government? It very much is! That is why we won't interfere this time. As an exception. What about the removal of crosses in schools? The presence of crosses discriminates against atheist youth. The constitution ensures the freedom of worship. Eighty percent of students are Catholic. They are the ones being discriminated against. Your eighty percent is a blatant exaggeration. Hello? Sister Maksencja? It's me, Staszek. No, I'm still waiting. Who in their youth carried water from a well will never waste even a drop when they're old. There's a folk tale about a girl who, while drawing water from a well, saw the moon's reflection. She got scared because she thought the moon had drowned and wouldn't shine at night. When she lowered a bucket down the well, the lever hit her in the chin so hard she saw the moon up in the sky. She rejoiced to see it on its rightful place. - I've never heard it. - It's easy to get deluded. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary… We have to discuss the matter of filling religious positions. It's not the People's Party's decision who becomes a vicar. Your information is wrong. Perhaps. However, in the archdiocese of Gniezno, which encompasses two voivodeships, the voivode of Bydgoszcz agreed to the appointment of a vicar, Ryszard Zięba, while the voivode of Poznań hasn't agreed to dismiss the same vicar from a parish in his voivodeship. It's his right to do so. His right? As for the rest of the harassment - the evidence is in the office of the Polish episcopate and the department of religious affairs. Not to mention the actions of censorship. You seized my sermons! It's discrimination. I am under the impression that comrade first secretary agreed on too much in certain matters. It's good he backed off when it comes to religion classes. How so? Religion in schools is the best way to turn the youth into atheists. That's not how Moscow sees it. We've had a call from the Central Committee. They informed us our priests will be able to study in Rome. I guess I know why they agreed so easily. Why? Rome informed me that foreign intelligence agents are present there. They might attempt to recruit priests to slowly erode the church from the inside. If so, then the future of the church looks bleak. The spirit of darkness is the spirit of unrest. Abandon these thoughts. What shall we do? Let's be consequent. We must sow. We pour the liquid into communicated vessels. As you can see, the liquid fills each vial evenly. We pour the next liquid into other communicating vessels, but with a different shape. And as you can see it is a slightly different story. I have a surprise for you. It's incredible. Who came up with it? God. The laws of nature are not invented but discovered. Archimedes discovered the rules governing communicating vessels. Enjoy your break. Be careful. Mariola, wait. I'll fix your bow. - Perfect. - Thank you. You're welcome. It's time to cut your hair. Headmaster. I would invite you for a meeting to my office, but it won't be necessary. I have informed you that if you'd like to continue working here, I need to see your party membership. Don't you think, comrade, that slowly but surely the primate is gaining traction? I do see it. This doesn't mean we aren't taking any action. Zenon, if you would. We are conducting a covert investigation of the primate under the codename "Prophet". It's not just the primate. It's the people closest to him. We follow his every step. His every word. We know every sentence, every letter and every gesture. The team consists of our best agents and informants. During his three-year-long isolation, he refused to cooperate with us. But everyone has a weakness. Sooner or later, we will catch him committing treason. Or maybe a tiny indiscretion? He will crack. Can you tell me what happened? I lied to my mum. I don't want to stay in a class with squirts. I can speak, I know the vocabulary. I'm doing fine, right? Skipping school is a bad idea. Staying in a class with those squirts is bad too. Kazia, I know that everyone has to find their own wisdom. But education is useful. I'll find a way without those squirts. I will. No school wants to hire me. Someone made sure I'll never work again. At least you can look in a mirror. Sit down, please. I'd like you to meet Kazia. - Kazia? - A young girl with potential. She could use a good teacher. How's our radio drama? Depends on the episode. It can be interesting. Go on then, for fuck's sake! They talk about God a lot. Right now, the ex-teacher whines she can't find any job. Are you testing me? I am. So you don't slack off. I'll never understand fractions. You will. Don't worry. A line between numbers always indicates division. One-fourth is one part of a four-part unit. 26 APRIL 1963, WARSAW COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE The western press often mentions us as if we were one. - I'm not worried about it. - Me neither. I'm concerned about how the Polish press depicts the church. You refuse to accept socialism. Working with you is difficult. Especially since the rules are set outside our borders. You also receive your directions from Rome. I don't get political orders. And please remember, I put myself on the line for you in the Vatican. I am and have been the face of the agreement between the church and the communist government. You criticize us in each of your speeches. - Do you want me to start searching? - Please. Go ahead. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT'S FILE My point exactly. You won't find anything. I will. In due time. It'll take at least half an hour. Can we take a walk, primate? Of course. Is it a formal walk? Quite the opposite. I was informing on you. Why is he still here? - He betrayed you. - They'll break the next one as well. He informed on you! - He can't be trusted. - He confessed and repented. They can't blackmail him anymore. - Enjoying it? - Coffee and cognac is what's keeping me alive. You still can join me. Nothing will happen if you take a few days off. If we leave tomorrow, we'll catch up with the group. I can't go. I have to work. There will be people on the pilgrimage. Same as here. - You won't get any sleep. - What's that nonsense? On the pilgrimage, when someone wants my soup they ask for it and don't steal! Stop it. You don't have to yell. I need to unwind. So you're still worried? What do you expect me to do? We've been married for 8 years and I can't get pregnant. We don't have our own place. We barely get by. No school wants to hire me. I'm scared to think about our future. Darling, when the stress is over, we'll have a baby. I can support our family. Zdzich! I can't film the pilgrimage. I think I'll be sick. It might even be tuberculosis. Stop making up stories. - You don't feel like it. - I can't go. Not now. Fine. I'll send someone else. You have two days to get rid of this tuberculosis. Thanks. You'll sleep when you're done. You're in a hurry, not me. Janek! How's it going? Hello. I'm just grabbing some tape. I'm asking in general. What can I say? Money's tight. My wife can't find a job, we live in a shared apartment. I understand. I may be able to help you. I always wanted a normal family. You have a loving mother. When I didn't know how to pray, I was asking God for a father. You are like a father to me. I've got to run. I have a class with Magda. How's the father? Sit still. Speak. How's the father? Are you mute or dumb? Don't move. - Calm down. - What's going on here? Hand over the reels and get lost. Not a word! Tell me what he's up to and you'll be fine. You might even get some money. Go. Do we have a deal? You bitch! Stop! - Good evening. Is Kazia home? - Who's asking? I'm her teacher. She knows me. Kazia? Did you miss the funeral? What funeral? - Is Kazia dead? - Her mother is. Fever finished her off. Who knows where Kazia went. - When was the last time you saw her? - Krycha! - Who is it? - It's not for you. The lady's looking for Kazia. She doesn't live here. She's been deregistered. She is where she belongs. Goodbye. The neighbours, her school… - No one knows where she is. - She would've said goodbye. We need to find her. I'm going to the Vatican Council. Meanwhile, you call the "Eights." MISSING Janek. Janek. I can't take it any more. Go back to sleep. We have to do something. What are you doing? What are those? They're just photos. I've been planning an exhibition. I wanted to surprise you. So pick them up yourself. Calm down. Then get us a tiny bit of intimacy! I will. Just calm down. Soon we'll live normally. I hope so. I can't imagine raising a child in such conditions. What? You heard me. Really? Are you serious? Darling… - You're going to be a father. - My God, I'm so happy. Are you sure? Come here! Kazia is still missing. Father must be extremely worried. Darling, you're pregnant. You have to avoid stress. I am nostalgic of the time I spent in Poland. Over 40 years have passed. I was a secretary of an apostolic nuncio in Poland. - I was even learning Polish. - Bravo. Nice to hear that. Thank you. All the more I hope your Holiness will join us in Jasna Góra to celebrate the Millennium of the Baptism of Poland. Thank you. Naturally, I accept your invitation. Nonetheless, I'm worried that the communist government might use my presence for propaganda. And suggest that I endorse their politics. They can try. We will draft an episcopal letter to every parish explaining the situation. Unfortunately, I also often have to rectify rumours about you, cardinal. - What rumours? - Some people are suspicious of your meetings with the communists. They even call you the "Red Cardinal." I've heard about those rumours. I will admit, they hurt me deeply. However, I would like to assure your Holiness that every meeting with the authorities serves solely the good of the Church and the Polish nation. Thank you. Thank you very much. As I was saying, we're on the eve of the Millennium of the Baptism. At the end of the plenary session of the fourth Vatican Council, we'll be inviting representatives of every episcopate in the world. The Germans too. Germans? We all know how the Poles suffered because of them. I often hear that the hate toward Germans is justified. It's incorrect. Hate ensnares those who hate. Not to mention that we all are one in Christ. On the eve of the Millennium, we should give testimony that we are willing to follow the example of our saviour who forgave his trespassers while dying on the cross. I asked the archbishop Bolesław Kominek to write a letter to German bishops. We'll attach it to our invitation to the celebrations. Are we ready for such steps? The war ended barely 20 years ago. The wounds are still fresh. That is true but as shepherds, we should lead by example. Show the way. God reconciled the world through Christ. He instructed us to unite. When the plenary session of the Vatican Council is over, I would like to ask all present bishops to sign the letter. "We forgive and ask forgiveness". We forgive the Germans? We? By what authority did the church and its bloody manager engage in their own foreign policy? We forgive and ask forgiveness. How did it happen? Why didn't your agents, who should follow his every step, find and prevent it from being published? I don't know, comrade. We're looking into it. Looking into it? It's our priority. There's nothing more dangerous than that man and his dreams of the power of the church. The Millennium is becoming increasingly riskier. They have invited representatives of the world's episcopates. Including the pope. He accepted the invitation. Listen to me, Zenon. Listen closely. No one is coming to those celebrations. Especially not the pope. We, the media committee and the press are preparing our own celebrations of the Millennium of Poland. Secular festivities. National and atheistic. We'll outshine them. It has to be enormous! It'll be our millennium. Come on. Hurry, gentlemen. Our leader's about to speak. I've been touring with the Newsreel lately. Magda might need my help. My hands are tied. A bad year to give birth. I thought that closer to the due date I could be a bit closer to home. That's when the main events will be! Are you crazy? She'll give birth with or without you. Get back to work. Move. Don't stand around! 17 JUNE 1966, POZNAŃ FIRST SECRETARY'S SPEECH DURING FESTIVITIES How constrained and void of any sense of nationhood is the mind of the manager of the Polish church. He, who is at war with the people's state, is an irresponsible shepherd's shepherd. He declares that he won't bow down to the Polish raison d'etat. 3 MAY 1966, CZĘSTOCHOWA MILLENNIAL FESTIVITIES In the name of all Polish bishops and entire Polish nation the Primate will read out the Millennium Act and devote Poland to our Holy Mother. Long live the Primate! Long live! In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. In the face of God, One in the Holy Trinity, in deep unity with the Head of the Roman-Catholic Church our Holy Father, Pope Paul VI, we, the Polish bishops, gathered at the feet of your throne in Jasna Góra, surrounded by members of the believing nation, the clergy, the Lord's people from dioceses and parishes, in communion with the Polish diaspora, we are surrendering with trusting hearts to your eternal, maternal servitude of love all of God's children of this christened nation and everything that constitutes Poland. For the freedom of the church in the world and in our homeland. Toward the expansion of the Kingdom of Christ on Earth. We are surrendering to your servitude of love the whole Poland, our beloved country, the entire Polish nation living here or abroad. Holy Virgin Mary, Mother of Church, Queen of Poland and Our Lady of Jasna Góra, we entrust ourselves to you and ask for the protection of Poland and the Polish nation. Repeat after me. We entrust. Watch out! Run! Quickly! I need to check your car. - Is that why you need the muscle? - Are we at war? - What gives you the right? - The People's Republic of Poland. No! We've got our orders. It's nothing short of sedition. It's an assault on a religious assembly. In the episcopate's name, I demand you stop the operation. - Advance! - No. - Stop right now! - Calm down. Don't attack. Stop! Settle down! Stand down! Please, stop it now! My son. - Criminals! - You'll pay! I couldn't stop them. Are you all right? - They took the painting. - It's not your fault. We will continue with an empty frame. Pause it. Rewind ten seconds. Janek. Come on. You're going to Cracow. And we need you back soon. You're filming the parade. JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER FOR GIRLS Good morning. Excuse me. I have visitation. I'm glad you're alive. How are you holding up? It's not ideal. You're strong. You can take it. I've been to prison too. I'll do everything possible to get you out. Dear Kazia, I can't visit you in person, but since you're reading this letter, Maria was able to see you. Halina and Maria informed me about your whereabouts. 22 JULY 1966, POZNAŃ OFFICIAL MILLENNIAL FESTIVITIES This is the newest generation of tanks. You know what? Film it yourself. Come back! You will regret it! Finally! Thank God and Virgin Mary. Come on. That single flower won't help you. She's giving birth. In the hospital. The hospital, yes! I didn't say a word. Kazia, I know. I'm sorry. Are you apologizing to me? I hate them. Hate doesn't lead to anything. I'm proud of you for finishing school. It was either fighting or studying. You've chosen the good. It just happened. - I need a word, censor! - What's up? - Can we talk? - Speak. I'd like to limit my work. A cigarette? Right. You quit. Congratulations. The labour went smoothly, right? Yes, everything worked out great. No baby shower? You can't complain about the money. - No, I just couldn't… - Calm down. I was joking. For abandoning your workstation you'll work double-time this month. Look, how pretty! There he is! You'll finally meet my husband. - Daddy. - Hello, my dear! Janek, this is Kazia. Kazia? I'm Janek. We've met. Really? Where? A car. Mostowa Street. Your friends locked me up. Janek? Magda was extremely upset. I feel so guilty. It's not your fault Janek led a double life. Sooner or later the truth would've come out. I'm going to Gdynia next week. I'm going to help Magda with the child. That's wonderful. Don't forget to write me once in a while. Sure thing! Workers don't eat ham, so it's not their concern! - It's Christmas time. - People feel tricked. - It was supposed to be better. - Comrades. I was a worker before the war. I had two shirts. Nowadays they have five or six. Non-iron! Isn't this progress? It's time they understood this. That won't be easy. They'll strike. They're organizing themselves in Gdynia already. Zenon. You deal with it. Absolutely. The situation in Poland is becoming increasingly harder. We can't neglect our relations with churches in other countries. It'll strengthen the country and the church. That is why you'll got to the United States and Australia. We need to improve our relations with churches in France and Germany. But later. Why me? Because only you can do it. I'm not accepting it. Don't listen to her. We'll take it. And a letter to the father. - It might be delivered late. - Fine. It'll arrive at some point. What about the package? We'll take it. I don't want his help. - It's all my fault. - No, it's not. Janek is a liar and a traitor. But he loves you. You have no idea about life without a family. You need to sign for it! Thank you for meeting with me, primate. We can talk freely here. I took photos of you. I just wanted to make her happy and safe. I'm sorry. Forgive me, father. I was so stupid. I took a shortcut. I wanted everything quickly. Let's not bring it up again. I'm glad that you understood your mistakes and you're sorry. Start over. You have a family. Win Magda back. She and the child need you. One regular to Gdynia. - For when? - Now. GDYNIA SHIPYARD 17 DECEMBER 1970, GDYNIA RAILWAY STATION Prices skyrocketed over night! - Average prices. - Prices of food. By how much? By 25%! Really? What am I going to do? - I can't afford anything now. - It's all a joke. But locomotives are cheaper. - Perhaps you'd like to buy one. - It's not funny. I want my kids to have a decent Christmas. Let's go. Let's go! Strike! Police curfew in Gdańsk, Gdynia and Sopot. What are you doing here? - And you? - I came to win Magda back. Run! Janek! This incident, so shortly before Christmas, was without precedent for our nation. Its tragic outcome was unforgettable and unheard of in our history. We feel understandable anguish, profound pain and and indescribable suffering. There's not one person in this country who wouldn't comprehend it. If only I could, with a sense of justice and harmony, I would take the responsibility for recent events. I gladly would. A nation needs someone to redeem its guilt. Jesus Christ, our perpetual shepherd, suffered for our sins. And in Poland this redemptive responsibility would fall on the primate of Poland. As you know, the situation in the North got out of hand. Despite our efforts, news about it has spread all over the country. If we don't control public sentiments, we'll face riots all over Poland. Tell me, minister. General! How did it all get so fucked up? Comrades. I report as follows - On 8 December I issued an order concerning joint counter-actions of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior. The goal was to ensure public safety. I would like to emphasize that I wasn't in command during this violent pacification of riots in Gdańsk and Gdynia. So who is responsible? Vice-speaker Zenon was on site. Zenon is the first secretary's right-hand man. Breaking news. Władysław Gomułka has resigned from his position of the first secretary of the Central Committee and a member of the Polish United Workers' Party due to his poor health. The committee has appointed the new first secretary, Edward Gierek. TWO DAYS LATER PRIME MINISTER JÓZEF CYRANKIEWICZ RESIGNED. Isn't your bear a bit cold? Warm him up. Run a little! I miss Janek. - I'll never forgive myself. - That is not your fault. If I hadn't left… He might've never understood his mistakes. Janek didn't deserve to die. Those bastards beat him to death. He never stood a chance! Where was God then? Where? Kazia, I understand. It's difficult. Our Holy Father loves Janek more than anyone else. We must believe that he has taken him at the best of times. Before he went to Gdynia, Janek opened his heart to God. I believe they're together. I hate them. As soon as I'll get a chance I will avenge him. Revenge won't help anyone. You can only hurt yourself. Will you do nothing? I'll pray for them and talk to the authorities. We can triumph over evil only with good and with truth. 16 OCTOBER 1978 THE VATICAN Habemus papam!
