And it was snowing. Bro, in snow. While it was snowing. Is she asking for food? Bro? Yup. Bro. We're not stopping. Why? Because time is money, and I ain't got either of them. I'll pay you, man, you know that. No, no, no, come on, bro, no. Tell her we travel with nothing. When she gets to America. They like complainers. They even have telephone numbers, bro, you call to complain. So when she gets there, she can call and complain about me. No, I didn't say that, bro. Then tell her what you said. No. Why? I refuse to speak her language, bro. Pull the car over. No, bro. No, bro. Pull the car over. No. Hey, hey. girl like that? - Seriously. - Seriously? It's like pulling hair. There are rules, bro.

That's bullshit. Get her out. Get the fuck out of my room! Your turn. No, no! No, no! No! No! No! No, no, no! No! No! Open your mouth. No! No! I can't have you having any babies. You act like you got raped. I'm gonna give you a house discount. Okay. Discount? Mm-hm. Discount. Un tattoo. It's all relative. So how did you... how'd you come aquí? How'd you come here? Aquí. How'd you get here? My dad. Sold my mom first. Then he sold me. Six times. I'm sorry. Six. Just to save his business. Do you know what I hate? Hate? I hate giving head. You know, blow job? It's like... - Eat? - Hungry, am I hungry? Ugh, I'm starving. Yes. I would love a pancake. This is my galaxy. Like, um, this is a lot of stars? Yeah. Hey. It's Disneyland. Disneyland! ♪ When you wish upon a star - Yeah. - Uh huh. Says her mom, um, didn't understand Disneyland. What? Mm... Um... Um, she didn't... like, her mom doesn't understand why a rat would be famous. - Mickey Mouse. - Uh huh. I have... 43,021 stars, to be exact. - Um... - Stars. Mm-hm.

Touch my skin. See? Won't you compliment me on my skin? You have soft skin. Baby's pee. You get a wet diaper and you cut some strips. You put it on your face. Babies have so many nutrients that are good for the skin. Makes my face soft. That's why I'm allowing Negrita to keep her baby. What the shit is on your face? What's that shit on her face? I want clean faces in this house. Look what you've done. You've come in here and turned my girls into hookers? Hookers are on the street! You ain't! Go to the store, buy some remover, and clean this shit off their faces. My customers want fresh faced girls. Can I help you with something? Come here now. Get over here. Come here. Cleveland Indians. They didn't win the World Series. Your t-shirt. Says they're the world champions. What's wrong with you, cat got your tongue? Show me your identification. Hey, show me your ID. ID, ID. I'm gonna take you in. Show me your ID now. What's wrong with you, you don't speak English? You're coming with me. Another homeless hooker, huh? Congratulations. You've got a home now. It's up to you how long you're gonna stay here. Do you understand? "Comprehend-o?" This is gonna be your new house. And unless you give me the information I need, this is gonna go down two ways. You're gonna tell me what I need to know. You do that, I'll send you back to whatever third world shit hole you came from, and you can live the rest of your life like a... Don't let her fool you, ma'am. She knows exactly what I'm saying. She knows English. Great. She just won't speak it. The Cleveland Indians lost. It's unlucky for them. But a win for you. We know those shirts were donated to Honduras. Is that where you're from? Honduras? Incorrect post-season apparel. It's the official term for it. I mean, I would love to see my Dallas Cowboys on a championship t-shirt even if it is incorrect. So I understand. And you set off with a coyote? He smuggled you here to America? The United States? You came here for a better life. Is that correct? A dream. Do you have dreams? Your coyote... He is a master manipulator. He looked for you. He searched for you. You. He made you believe life would be better here. But it's not, is it? That's nowhere near the truth. When you arrive, there is no job, only debt that you owe to your smuggler that you have to keep paying and paying and paying. There's no end to it. You work as a prostitute? You have sex for money? Your keeper charges you for things like food and rent in order to control you. The debt is elusive. Do you know that word, debt? Debt? Do you understand? Let's start with something simple. Nona.
