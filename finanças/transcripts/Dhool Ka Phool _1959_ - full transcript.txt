As if there won't be any expenses for the wedding. I'll spend for the wedding if something is left. What has happened to you nowadays? Has some veil covered your eyes? Have you lost your eyesight? Have you no concern for anything? Every day you damage something. Uncle, that... lnstead of asking if she's hurt... you're concerned with the damages. What's to ask? She's standing here, hail and hearty. And now you're asking, aren't you? What can a maidservant ask? When you were small, I used to enquire about you. Now I want to see these children happy. My only wish is that they lead a happy life. Come dear. Come and eat something. Silence, Silence. Quiet please. Thank you. Friends, just now we presented some items.

Both the girls and the boys will present their point of views. From the boys' side, Mr. Mahesh Kapoor. And from girls' side Miss Meena Khosla. Ms. Meena and Mr. Mahesh, on the stage please.

I need the support from your love I am being faithful and expect the same from you I need the support from your love I am being faithful and expect the same from you Asking for beautiful damsels to be faithful?

I wish to build a temple of love And worship you, day and night I am being faithful and expect the same from you Consent of your love. Great, dear. Excellent. Wow. Just think before giving your heart That one has to loose before gaining something Take permission from the world, first That you wish to worship beauty You are so naive You don't know what you're asking for So very naive How can one, who is love struck by you, live? It is impossible to live without a companion Enough of the signals from far I wish to behold you close up I am being faithful and expect the same from you Consent of your love The whole world is an enemy of love The destiny of love is separation No one listens to the sighs of the hearts And you want to ask me from such a world? You are so naive. You don't know what you're asking for? So very naive By holding the corner of the drape in your lips Just look at me with a smile Take me away from myself, by coming close to me Because I wish to play with death I am being faithful and expect the same from you Consent of your love. Hail Mahesh. Great. All your claims and promises are false How can love be taken to its fulfillment? Here, life is controlled by traditions and rituals You want to break the traditions?

I wish to hold this hand I am being faithful and expect the same from you Consent of your love - Greetings, sir. - Greetings. - Here. Your letter. Bye. My dear son, Mahesh. We haven't written to each other for so many days. Your exams have been over for a month... yet still no word from you. I hope the papers went well. May God grant you success. I've been bedridden for the last month. If you want to see me... consider this to be a telegram and come soon. Great father. Without any ailment, you fall sick... and then get well without any medicine. Rai Sahib, nowadays boys have become so uncontrollable. They don't even care about their fathers. I must have written a thousand... letters to him but still no reply. - Shall I give you an idea? - Tell me. Send news of your demise, this time. Perhaps, he may come. You're joking. I'm his father. Until now I was thinking of his studies. - Now I'm thinking of his future. - Don't worry about that. Just send Mahesh to me. I can send him only when he comes. The exams aren't all over. I don't know which he's taking now. Thank you. I'm putting a flower in your hair. Your gaze lowers from bashfulness. I don't know what I'm going to say today. That my mouth is becoming dry and the voice is getting choked. You seem to know this couplet by heart. In the hair of how many girls have you put flowers? - Shall I tell you the truth? - Yes. - One. Who? There is a girl, very beautiful. Who is she? Shall I tell? Let go of it. Leave it. Okay, wear it. Hey, Meena. Meena. - Very fortunate. - Who? Our collision. Do you remember the collision? And after that... After that, you'd say, we met... you met, eyes met and the hearts met. Listen, I don't want a love scene. Understood? What a beautiful climate. The music of the heart would start to play The moment, you would smile The world of us, impatient ones, would be made The moment, you would smile With your smile the springs will smile too And the shimmering row of stars would smile as well With your smile the surroundings will smile too The youthful heartbeats would smile as well The music of the heart would start to play The world of us, impatient ones, would be made The moment, you would smile The fragrance enveloping the breeze Shadows of your tresses on your eyes The springs of high spirits, boiling within These storms whirling inside the hearts The music of the heart would start to play The world of us, impatient ones, would be made The moment, you would smile These heavy clouds, showering These restless souls, yearning These embers emanating from the breaths These bodies melting in the heat The music of the heart would start to play The world of us, impatient ones, would be made The moment, you would smile We committed a big mistake. This is sin. You're right, Meena. We shouldn't have made such a mistake. We're both guilty in the eyes of society. It's been over two months since the exams finished. The boy doesn't even think of coming. Whenever I write to him, he postpones it, somehow. Okay, son, I'm your father. I'll write again. Dear Mahesh... I met Rai Sahib Mr. Laxmi Narayan regarding your job. But he wants to meet you. If he happens to like you, you'll go places. You'll get a car, a bungalow and other things. Dear Mahesh, one doesn't get such jobs every day. Come here as soon as you read this letter. Very good, a bungalow and a car. Great father. You're simply great. What a job you've discovered. What else is written? If you don't come upon receiving... the letter, then I'll come there. Oh father, why take the trouble? I'll come on the morning train. I wish to get the support of your love. I am being faithful and expect the same from you. Of your love. - Meena. Meena. - Coming, auntie. No no. Come, Meena. Good that you've come. I was about to visit you. Meena, what's the matter? Mahesh, are you going somewhere? Meena, I didn't wish to go, but father demanded I come. So I have to go. But Meena, what brings you here so early in the morning? There's no morning for me, only night and darkness. What are you saying, Meena What happened? That which shouldn't have happened. - I am expecting. - What did you say? Meena, you expecting? Very unfortunate. What will happen now? What should be done now? Marry me Mahesh, marry me. Marriage? Yes, we should definitely get married. There's no other way. As soon as I get home, I'll talk to father... and urge him to allow the wedding. Mahesh, I expected this from you. Don't worry, Meena. I'll go today and return soon. And yes, write to me as soon as you get there. Sure. I'll write tomorrow and you'll get it the day after. I'll be waiting for you. I'll be back very soon, Meena, I'll be back very soon. Postman. - Is there no letter for me? - No madam. The girl is beautiful, well behaved and educated. I've met her. I like her. You should meet her, too. But father, what's the hurry? I'm in a hurry because Rai Sahib is a billionaire. He has only one daughter. Moreover, he's sick. He might have a heart attack anytime. The earlier the wedding, the better. I won't commit for this wedding, father. Refuse them. Huh. Refuse them? Idiot. I'm also your father. I'll see that he marries her. - Is there any letter for me? - No, my cycle's chain came off. - Didi, Didi. Didi, Didi. - Didi, Didi, Didi, Didi. - Didi, Didi, get us sweets. Get us sweets. - For what? - First give us the money. - You passed. - See this. Sister has passed, first class. Sister has passed, first class. Daughter, don't forget my sweets. Our Didi has passed, in first class. How can I forget you, auntie? What happened, dear? Aren't you happy at passing? I am happy, very happy, auntie. Aunty. Have you come to tell me you passed? I already know it. No, auntie, I want to go out for one day. Sure, sure, your father left Rupees 20 thousand. In 20 years not even a single penny has been spent, right? No auntie, I don't want money. I have some on me. Am I some ticket clerk to give you tickets? Or am I a train coach to carry you to your destination? Nothing of the sort, auntie. My friend asked me to her wedding. Did I say some enemy called you? Why ask me? Go, definitely. Tell uncle I'll be back the day after tomorrow. Whether you come tomorrow or the day after, I'll tell him. And if you don't come then I'll still tell him. Okay? Listen, where is street No. 5? Go straight and first left. Thank you. I am being faithful and expect the same from you I need the support from your love In the name of faithfulness, so many sins are committed Ask this to those who get ruined Got a blot on life I was deceived in love Got a blot in life, oh goodness A small mistake of the youth... which you won't even remember But with taunts of that mistake, the world will harass me The gaze will drop in shame. Because I have received such a blow today I was deceived in love Got a blot in life For love, which was supposed to... For my love, who was supposed to do away with the traditions Who was supposed to live and die with me Handing me over to the storm Went and sat far away I was deceived in love. Got a blot on life Just see, my helpless faithfulness has become a shameful tale The souvenir of love has become the souvenir of a sin By giving me a lifelong sorrow... he adorned his bed of happiness I was deceived in love. Got a blot on life Dear, you? Why are you standing outside? Come inside. Give me the bag. Dear, you went for your friend's marriage? Marriage? Marriage happened, auntie, the marriage took place. But why are you crying? What happened, dear? Nothing, nothing. You're hiding something from me. You went in the morning and already returned. What happened? Tell me, daughter. You're under my oath. Tell me what happened. That man deceived me, auntie. Deceived you? Aunty, aunty... I... I'm expecting. God, you are expecting? Who is that rascal? Where does he live? What's his name? Come with me. I'll finish him off. I'll throttle him. If you want to strangle someone, do it to her... the one who has caused us such shame. Meena, get out of my house. Get out this very moment. - Sir. - Gangu Dai, keep quiet. This filth can never stay in my house. You cursed one... instead of this shameful act, better you had drowned yourself. Get of my house. Uncle. I don't even want to see your face. Get lost. Get out of my house. - Get out. - Father. - Get out. - Get out. - Father. - Get out. There's no place in my house for a harlot like her. Meena. Let me die. Let me die. To hide the man's sin? To make him stronger? Dying for his sins? This is the only path left for me. Forget it. Man, for his pleasures, pushes the woman to this path. And many women like you... die carrying the burden of a man's sin. What can I do? Where can I go? All the doors are shut to me. The doors of my shanty are open for you. I'll take you to my place. I'll wait for the day when the... sin of that sinner steps in this world. And I'll go and throw it at the doors of that despicable man. Come dear, come. Don't cry. Come. Come sit, dear. Why are you standing? Sit. Falling in love before marriage is a mistake. Many girls like you get trapped... in this false love to ruin their lives. Low clouds, singing winds, raise dreams My little heart starts longing Fragrant and enchanting surroundings Glowing shades of colors spread everywhere Today, the sky getting enthralled, calls us Low clouds, singing winds, raise dreams My little heart starts longing A small boat floats with the wind The boatman sings the song on... the instrument of the river Your body, with each wave... sways in my mischievous eyes My body and soul are for you This life filled with love, is for you In my eyes are only images of you Low clouds, singing winds, raise dreams My little heart starts longing Malti, how very beautiful the flowers look in your hair. - Really? May I ask you something? - Ask. In the hair of how many girls, have you put the flowers? Malti, there was a girl in whose hair I liked the flowers very much. Who was she? You felt bad, right? No, what was her name? - Her name was Malti. - Liar. - Shall I give you some good news? - Why not? - We're going to have a flower-like child. - Really? Come son. Come son. Congratulations, it's a boy. - Thank you nurse. - Thank you sister, thank you. Congratulations, on the grandson, Roopchand. Congratulations to you too, for the grandson. The astrologer said it would be a girl. Let the astrologer say anything. A girl is never born to our neighbors, even. We always bring girls from others only. My entire clan is full of the moustaches. My grandfather's grandfather had a son. My grandfather's father had a son. My grandfather had a son, my father. My father had a son, me. I had a son in Mahesh. And now Mahesh has a son, too. God willing, it will be a row full of sons in the future, too. Come. Rai Sahib, such happy occasions don't come often. Why not celebrate? Magan, Chagan, Laxmi, where are you all? Distribute sweets to the neighbors. Distribute clothes and money to the poor and destitute. This donation will be in your account. After that arrange for a dance program. The dance arrangements will be in your account. You're talking about arrangements? Even the dancers'll be in my account. Are you the flower of my love, or my mistake? Can't say anything But you pay for someone's deeds. This, too, I can't tolerate My disgrace will grow along with you Listening to the taunts, my motherhood will be hurt My disgrace will grow along with you All your paths are full of thorns in life Who will become your support, in this cruel world? Are you the flower of my love, or my mistake? Can't say anything But you pay for someone's deeds. This, too, I can't tolerate If someone asks, whom will you call your father? The world will call you a discarded sin Your life will be another name of embarrassment, as long as you live I will feed you milk but you will have to swallow the poison Are you the flower of my love, or my mistake? Can't say anything But you pay for someone's deeds. This, too, I can't tolerate Meena, just come out, please. Auntie, auntie, what happened to auntie? Why not tell me what happened to auntie? While walking on the way, she fell down. And she passed away immediately. Now who is there in this world for me? You left me, auntie. Why? Meena. So you've recognized me? Now it's of no use. I'm married. I know. Then why come? The gift you gave me in the name of love... I've come to return it. - Here, take it. - Child? Yes, child, your child, yours. The fruit of your sin. You were involved, too. You involved me. You pushed me in the ditch of sin. You're responsible for this. You should have thought before. You weren't a kid. You were mature. The maturity of a woman doesn't stand in front of a man's fraud. A man promises of love and the woman trusts it. A man throws a snare of deceit and... a woman wears it considering it to be a garland of love. You made false promises of love to me. While pretending faithfulness you spread the hand of unfaithfulness. Why did you hold that hand? Women never hold a hand. Her hand is being held. You held my hand. It's your mistake, and your fault. It's not only my mistake. We both made the mistake. Why should I be the only one to suffer? Take care of him. That's not possible. I'm a respected man. I have a name in this world. He'll bring me a bad name. Will he bring a good name to me? I'm a respectable person, like you. I, too, want to walk in this world with my head held high. Walk with your head held high or not... but I've no relation with him. No relation? I have nothing to do with him, either. Fine then, throw him away. Throw him away? Where to throw? Wherever you want. I don't know anything. I won't throw him away. I'll hang him on your neck. I'll scream before the world that this is Mahesh's child. That Mahesh is his father. Who'll believe you? What proof do you have? I have no relation with this child. I want nothing to do with him. I'm a respected person. He'll bring a bad name to me. And he'll bring me a good name? I'll scream and say he's Mahesh's child. Who'll believe you? What proof do you have? Throw him away. Throw him away. Throw him away. Why are you crying? Why don't you die. Ya Allah. The provider has left him to die. And the killer is giving him protection. What wonders you show, oh Lord. Whose child is this? ls there anybody? Is there somebody to take this child? Munna, Munna... Munna, Munna... Munna... Munna... Where is my child? Where is he? Munna... Where is my child? Where is he? Munna... Munna, Munna... Munna, Munna... - Greetings, Abdul uncle. - Greetings, how are you? Greetings. - Come, Abdul uncle. Come. - Greetings, Punditji. Give him to me. Sit uncle, sit. God bless you. You have done an act of great virtue. Allah will definitely reward you for this virtue. You've done an act of great virtue. Praise to you. You are like a God. Such a flower-like child. I don't know whose he is. Must be of some unmarried or widowed woman. Who else would discard him? Whoever he is, he's a child after all. - Ramzani, oh Ramzani. - Uncle? You have 6-7 children. One more will be fine. He'll grow up alongside them. Oh, Uncle, we don't know about his caste and religion. How can I keep him in my house? God forbid, uncle, God forbid. Sister Jamuna, you've wanted a child for years Going to pilgrimages, doing penances, keeping fasts. God has sent this child to you. Sitting at home only. Take him. Instead of such a child, better not to have any. Whose is it? Who knows whether he's Hindu or Muslim? Punditji, he might also be Christian. Everybody loves his own religion. C'mon, get along with our work. C'mon, get along with our works. - Come on, priest. - Come on. If they love their religion, I love this child. Don't cry, son. Let them go. I'm here. By the grace of God, I have the strength in me. I will raise you, son. Come home. May I come in? Please, come. Be seated. Well, I have come for the job. I read your advertisement in this newspaper. Do you know shorthand and typing? I know typing. - Shorthand? - Shorthand? Well, I'll learn it. For sure. You'll learn? But I need a shorthand typist. I've nobody in this world. As soon as I get a job, I'll learn it all. I'll learn everything. Where do you live? If I get a job, I'll search for a place to stay. - What about you academics? - Bachelor of Arts. Very well, you may begin work immediately. I'll arrange for a place for you to stay as well. Thanks. Thank you very much. The typewriter is there and this is the file. Put it there. Thank you. Meena Devi, please come here. What is this that you've written? Mother and child? When did I ask you to write this? Sorry, I made a mistake. I won't make that mistake again. Don't know where your attention is. Type it again. Did you like that room? Yes, it's very nice. If you want anything else, feel free to ask. Fine. Thank you. - Meena Devi. - Yes. What's the matter? You're always lost somewhere. See, in everyone's life some incident happens... which leaves a wound on the heart. But life goes on, it should go on. It must go on. It is your blessings that we can see. We see your miracle everywhere. Dear Ramzani, here I see everyone's future. Abdul uncle is coming. Your way is full of difficulties. - Greetings, priest. - Greetings. Greetings. Wait son, let me smoke a little. Then I'll get your milk. Just pass that hookah to me. Excuse me, but you've been excommunicated. I've been excommunicated? - What crime have I committed? - You've provided shelter to someone's sin. And now you're nurturing that sin. This child is your crime. Is this little flower my sin? - Yes. - Are you listening, Priest? I picked him up off the street. Did I commit a crime? I'm raising him, considering him a gift of God. Is this a crime? - = The counsel heads are like God. - Whether they are Hindu or Muslim. And their verdict is the verdict of God. Very right. Very right. May such counsel heads and their verdict go to hell. Abdul uncle, these words are from Hindus and Muslims. Shame on such Hindus and such Muslims... who consider raising a human child to be a sin. It's perfectly okay to raise a dog. It's perfectly valid to raise a cat. And Ramzani, you can grow parrots and pigeons. You can give shelter to a dog's, a cat's, animals' offspring... but you can't give shelter to a human child? Is this your religion? Abdul uncle, you're insulting the religion. Not I, but you're murdering humanity... on the pretext of religion. Whoever he is, he's a human. And it's the duty of every human being to protect another human being. One who turns the face away from humanity... is neither a true Muslim, nor a true Hindu. They carry the torch of religion. And they haven't even been touched by humanity. Don't worry, son. I'll raise you. I'll give you my blood. There's no humanity in this place. We won't live here. You won't grow up to be Hindu or Muslim. You're a human child and you'll grow up to be a human being You won't grow up into a Hindu or a Muslim You're a human child and you'll grow up to be a human being It's good you don't have any name Thus you have nothing to do with any religion The knowledge which has corrupted the humans... you're not under the influence of any such knowledge You'll be a symbol of the changed times You're a human child and you'll grow up to be a human being You won't grow up into a Hindu or a Muslim The Almighty made everyone a human being But we turned them into a Hindu or a Muslim God bestowed us with only one earth But we divided it into boundaries of various nations The one who breaks all the barriers, you will turn into such a storm You're a human child and you'll grow up to be a human being You won't grow up into a Hindu or a Muslim. That, which teaches hatred is not your religion That which crushes a fellow human, is not your path That which has no Koran is not your temple That which has no Gita is not your mosque You will grow as the hope of peace and cooperation You're a human child and you'll grow up to be a human being You won't grow up into a Hindu or a Muslim These traders of religion and brokers of the nation These merchants of shrouds of human corpses These killers and robbers sitting in the palaces Those who sell the garden of soul for thorns in return You will grow into a declaration of their death You're a human child and you'll grow up to be a human being You won't grow up into a Hindu or a Muslim - Greetings. - Greetings. Yes? Nothing, just that I'm not going to the court today. I've typed that letter. Meena Devi, please come here. Did I make another mistake? No, not at all. I want to say something else. Please sit. See, I'm a person of a clear heart and consciousness. If I say something, please don't feel badly... and clearly say yes or no. Yes or no? I don't understand. Well, the thing is that I mean... See, don't ask about my past, I want to forget everything. I also want you to forget everything. I don't want to ask about your past. I want to marry you. But, but you don't know... I can understand that you were abandoned in love. The same happened to me. And I also know that love before marriage is just a play. That's why I want to marry you before falling in love with you. If you don't like me, say it clearly. It won't hurt me. No, that's not the case. Then, I don't want to listen to anything else, Meena. How to express the feelings of my heart? The heartless beloved took happiness away and left sorrows behind How to express the feelings of my heart? At the slightest sound my hopes are aroused I keep waiting for you with an adorned bed. The heartless one spent the night with my rival How to express the feelings of my heart? Love is a lie, and so is the beloved I was hurt and the dreams were shattered The hopes of sweet union were drowned in the tears of the eyes How to express the feelings of my heart? The heartless beloved took happiness away and left sorrows behind How to express the feelings of my heart? Here, take some more. - No, enough uncle. - What do you mean, enough? Why do you eat like a bird? Eat like a lion. Save some for yourself, uncle. I have enough for me. If you're full, then I'm full too. Son, you have a holiday tomorrow, right? Yes uncle, but I won't study in that school any longer. Why son? That Pundit's son says I have no father or mother. - I said Abdul uncle is my father. - You're right. So that Mullah's son said Abdul uncle isn't my father. You're a bastard. A bastard. Uncle, what's a bastard? Those who are idlers and freeloaders. Both the Pundit and the Mullah are such freeloaders. Don't play with such loafers. I'll get you admitted to another school. Go, clean yourself up. 1, 2, and 3. 4, 5, 6. 7, 8, 9 and 10. You apply powder every day. Today, I'll apply powder, too.

Very cruel parents, he had. God bless the child. Only God is the name of his father. And as for caste, write anything. Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian. But myself, I'm a Muslim. But I don't consider him as a Hindu or a Muslim. I think him to be a human being. So you don't know anything about his parents? All I know is he's the son of some devil. And every human being is his father. I respect your feelings. Then write my name in place of the father's name - Tell me. - Abdul Rashid. For the last 8 years I've raised him. Mohan, have you heard? Roshan has no clue about his parents. What? Doesn't know who his parents are? What parents. His caste and religion are also unknown. - So, is Roshan a bastard? - Yes. No, not here, Miyan Roshan Ali.

There's a clear line on your palms for one offspring. Only one child? Yes, there's a line for only one child. One is enough for us, isn't it, Meena? Just see when this auspicious moment will arrive. It should already have arrived. Hand is full and the lap is empty? This is very worrisome. Nothing to worry about. Dear, you'll be a mother very soon. How soon, this you tell her. I'll take your leave. Please look carefully. Is there a line for only one child? Yes, there's a line for only one child. - Perhaps that happiness is not in my destiny. - But it is. You son will be very fortunate. Come Roshan, come. This is my home. Ramesh, your house is superb. Who is he, Ramesh? He is my maternal grandfather and he is my paternal grandfather. And now they're both gone. He is my daddy. Your daddy is very nice. My mother is also very nice. This is my mummy. - Dear Ramesh. - Mummy. - You've come, dear Ramesh. - Mummy. - Who is he, with you? Mummy, he's my classmate. - He's my best friend. - Really? What's your name, dear? - Roshan. - Nice name. You'll definitely bring glory to your parents' name. - Mummy, I'll bring glory to my parents' name, too. - Okay. Okay, mummy, we're going out to play. No son, first you eat and then go to play. - Go. You both go and wash up. - Come, Roshan. "Give me boiled egg, soon" "I am famished" "Oh, my dear mother" Sit. Sit. Here, have some milk. I don't feel like drinking milk. No son, one shouldn't do like that. Listen, pick up the glass and I'll count to ten. The one who finishes it first will get an apple. Understood? C'mon, pick up the glass. - Ready? - Ready. One, two, three, four, five, six... seven, eight, nine and ten. I'm first. Good. Both together. - And this is your reward. - Thank you. Roshan son, you can come here to play, everyday. Yes mummy, he'll come every day. Ramesh son. Ramesh son. Daddy. - When did you come? - Just now. Today I'll take my son on an outing. Take him too. Ramesh, who is he? He's my friend, my best friend. Greetings. He's not worthy to be your friend. Friendship with such boys is not good, son. Why? What's the matter? Not a matter, Malti. A flaw. It's a blemish. It's immoral. No daddy, he is very nice. He has no bad habits. No my son, you don't know. He's a burden on earth. A living sin. You belong to a lineage, son, while his lineage isn't known. You have respect. He has disgrace. No one knows of his mother or father. He's an illegitimate child. Don't play with him. Don't bring him with you. Don't dare to bring him home again. Roshan. Wait, Roshan. - Roshan. - Ramesh! - Uncle. - You've come, son. Why are you standing there? Come inside. First tell me, who is my mother? Who is my father? - Myself, son. - No. No, you aren't my father. Tell me who my father is. I am your father, dear. Who has misled you? You only misled me. You only lied to me. You aren't my father. You are Abdul uncle. You know all about it. Everything. Tell me, who my parents are? Whose son I am? Where do I belong? Who am I? You are among those who are eliminated... as soon as they're born. Those who are put to sleep... not in a cradle but in the hostile sea. Those who don't get the light of the house... but the deep darkness of the well... or the horrific desolation of forests. Those who get the lap, not of their parents... but the lap of death. And if those unfortunate ones remain alive... the world kicks and butts at them... and they grow up amidst the ridicule and abuses of the world. But you tell me, uncle, how long must I put up with the abuses? How long must I live in such a manner? Don't worry, son. Whatever the world may say or understand... I will take you to be my son. I'll swear on God, you are my son. My nice uncle. Uncle. - My son. - Uncle. My nice uncle. Roshan. Roshan, come sit in my car. Roshan. Driver, you take the car back. I'll walk. Roshan. Roshan, are you angry at me? Yes, I'm angry. Yesterday, after you left, mummy scolded daddy a lot. I was angry, too. Your daddy is right. I'm blemished. I'm a living sin, Ramesh. Even my parents aren't known, Ramesh. There is nobody of mine in this world. No one to call my own. There is. I am yours. You are my brother, Roshan I don't have a brother. Nor am I a brother to anyone. I'm all alone. For God's sake, you won't see me, either. I will meet you. Most definitely. No one will dare stop me. Come Roshan. Come on, brother. Just see, a pair of horse and a donkey is arriving. One with a great father. Another without any father. Say it again. Who's without a father? It's you. You bastard. - I'll take care of him. - Forget it. I alone can handle him. - Hit me if you have guts. - Here. Roshan, let go of him. Let go of him, brother, let go of him. Move aside, Ramesh. Sir has come. Sir has come. Tell me. Say who's a bastard? Roshan, sir will be angry. I don't care for any sir. Understood? Let's see what comes out. "My hat is very lucky." The king is here. Are only papers stuffed inside? - Shucks. - Only one rupee? Which pauper were you following? He looked like a gentleman. Gentlemen of today don't have money in their pockets... but only hunger and unemployment. Understood? Go behind those whose pockets are full. Just see, full 500. - Great, boss. - Move your hand. - My tip? - I taught you the work and you want a tip? - This won't do, boss. - Take. You, too, will remember me. Take this. And you, too, take, my dear. Let it come. Mine was, I dug a mountain and it came out a molehill. Hey, someone's sitting there. Don't worry, boss. He looks like he's skipped school. Then he'll come to our school. Just give it a try. His innocent face will be of immense use to us. As your order, sir. Oh Dishonesty, bless me. Okay. Then go to him. Hey, get up from there. What are you staring at? Didn't I ask you to get up? Why? I won't get up. - Won't get up? - Nope, I won't.. You won't get up? Is this bench your father's? You want a few? What are you doing? Let go of him. - Who are you to butt in? - Your father. Bullying a child? Get out of here. I'll deal with you too. Go get lost. I've seen many like you. If ever you say anything to this kid, I'll break your teeth. - What's your name, dear? - Roshan. Good. Going to school? - No, coming. I'll never go to school now. - Why? I've stopped my studies from today. Very nice, child. Uncle Chhagan has said... if you study, you'll become spoiled. And if you play, you'll become a king. Dear, I'll teach you such tricks to earn... - that you'll put good educated people to shame. - Really? Yes, all the time your pockets will be full. Just see this. Such a bundle of notes. But I don't know any work. You'll learn, don't worry. I'll teach you in seconds. Pick up this bag. This might be useful sometime. Let's celebrate with some tea. "Oh Lord, where have your brought me to?" It's dusk and Roshan hasn't come home yet. Got very late today, son? Now I'll be late every day. I may even stay out for a couple of days. How come, my son? I've joined the training class in school. They teach ways to earn money in it, uncle. Forget the earning now. You're still small. May God bring that day soon... that you finish your education, and begin earning on your own. Those days won't come, uncle. They've come now. Madan, Ramesh has come. But he hasn't come. He'll come some day or other. I'll teach him such a lesson, that he'll remember it. We have to live for ourselves Whatever happens, let it happen What has that to do with us? We have to live for ourselves. We have to die for ourselves Whatever happens, let it happen. What do we have to do with it? Those who care for the world... let them suffer the world We will dance on the streets... and play on the footpaths Do you understand, my brother? Those who care for the world... let them suffer the world We will dance on the streets... and play on the footpaths Let them sigh who want to sigh We have to live for ourselves We have to die for ourselves Let whatever happens, happen What has that to do with us? When we begged for love people ignored us Finally we too have kicked the world with the tip of our shoe Very good, pal The life had to pass somehow It'll pass this way too We have to live for ourselves. We have to die for ourselves Whatever happens, let it happen. What do we have to do with it? Worriless like us, there aren't any other in the world While the world is drowning in sorrows, we're drowning in our joys What did you understand, brother? We live and die as we like We have to live for ourselves We have to die for ourselves Whatever happens, let it happen What has that to do with us? Come son, come. Will you take these books? Brand new. Yes, yes, but you'll only get the price of used books. Why? They're brand new. Not even a month old. Everything new becomes old after only an hour. I'll give you half the cost. Just show me the books. Roshan. Are you buying new books? - No, I'm selling them. - Why? Because I've started my new business What business, friend? Just that, items from here to there and there to here. Items from here to there and there to here. I didn't understand anything. I lost while gambling yesterday, pal. Lost in gambling? Roshan, have you started to gamble? What else to do? Studying is only for decent people. - Take them. Give me the half rate. - Roshan, don't be mad. I won't let you sell these books. Come, let's go to school. Come, c'mon. What use is going to school? No matter how much I study... I'll still be called a bastard. No Roshan, education removes all stigmas. Roshan, Valmiki was an outlaw. But because of knowledge, he became such a great sage. You have to become a good person. A good boy. You can become a good boy. You can become an important person. What do I have to do? Who is there in this world for me? - I don't want to study. - If you won't study, I won't either. Sell off my books too. I'll gamble and loaf around, too. - I'll become a hooligan, too. - Ramesh! Ramesh, wait, take your books. I'll go to school. - Really? - Yes. - Come. - Come. Sit down, boys. What happened, Madan? Sir, Roshan is back. Why did you hit him? He cussed me. Why didn't you tell me? You scoundrel. - Where were you for 8 days? - Sir, he was sick. You keep quiet! Tomorrow, bring a letter from your uncle. - Madan Mohan. - Yes, sir. - Pyarelal. - Yes, sir. - Roop Kishan. - Yes, sir. - Jagannath. - Yes, sir. - Bakhtiyar Ahmed. - Yes, sir. - Mony Kapoor. - Yes, sir. - Madhu Kumar. - Yes sir. - Jamaluddin. - Yes, sir. - Ravi Kumar. - Yes, sir. - Rahim. - Yes, sir. - Ravi Kapoor. - Yes, sir. - Sultan. - Yes, sir. Sir, Roshan tore my book. Roshan, come here. Why did you tear his book? I didn't tear his book, sir. Sir, Roshan didn't tear his book. Ask Dinesh, sir. Yes, sir, he tore it in front of me. No sir, this is all a lie. You won't give up this way. Go and stand on your bench for the whole week. Roshan. Let him go. Ramesh, sit in your place. What are you all watching? Open your books. What was yesterday's lesson? Roshan, what are you doing over here? I'll get revenge on Madan. - You shouldn't do that, Roshan. - I will do it. This isn't how decent people behave, Roshan. Who says I'm decent? I'm a goon, a confirmed goon. - Roshan. - Ramesh. There he goes. Now he can't escape me. I'll finish him off. No Roshan, I won't let you go. Don't become my enemy, Ramesh. Roshan, wait, I won't let you go. No. Get out of my way. Roshan. Roshan. Stop. He's badly hurt. Just see. Take him to the hospital. - Ramesh. - Take him. - Ramesh. Nurse. Ramesh my son, what has happened to you? My son. What have you done, my son? Doctor, save my son. Do anything, but save my Ramesh. I beg of you, doctor. Please save my son. Please save my son. Please save my son. Ramesh son, are you angry with your mother? Why don't you speak, my son? - Mother. - Yes son. - Father. - Yes son. Roshan brother. No. Oh no. May I drink some water? Yes, sure. Drink. Wait, the water must be hot. Nikki, bring a glass of cold water. Bringing, ma'am. Come here, dear. - What's your name? - Roshan. - Roshan? - Yes. Such a lovely name. - In which class do you study? - Sixth. - Sixth? Water. Here, drink it. You're buttons are wrong. Doesn't your mother care to do it right? I don't have a mother. No mother? And father? I have no one in this world to call my own. I had a friend, but he, too, went away. Why did you start to cry, dear? I don't know why the tears rolled down. Shall I go? No. No. Shall I go, mother? Mother? Roshan! - Hold this for a while. - But... - No buts, the police are behind. Go, run, run. You go that way, I'll go this way. He came here. Where could he have gone? He must be hiding somewhere here. Stop. Nab him. I'm not a thief. I didn't steal. I'm not a thief. But how can you tell that he didn't steal? I can assure you my son isn't a thief. He cannot steal. Sit, see, the stolen goods were found on him. This is somebody's mischief. He is completely innocent. Please, save him. Please. He's a child without parents. That means he's not your son? Just the way he is my son, so is he your son too. That means he's an orphan. An orphan is more fortunate than him. Because it is known who his parents are. But there's no clue who his parents are. I found him in the forest. In the forest? Yes, in the forest. I still remember the year and the date. It was in 1947. Fifteenth day of April. It was Tuesday, no... it was Wednesday. Around ten at night, I was returning from the city. Near Ramghat, he was lying near the fig tree. An infant, perhaps only 4-5 months old. - And you picked him up from there? - Yes. And since then, I've been raising him. My sympathies are with you. I'll try my best to get your son released. Thanks a lot, sir. It will indeed be a great favor. Come to the court tomorrow morning. - Very well. Regards. - Regards. What are you thinking, Meena? Chowk Bazaar Police Station. Produce Roshan. Your Honor, we found Jamunadas' bag... and Rs.10,000 cash on this boy. The inspector from Chowk Bazaar Police Station... caught him running with the bag. - Did you steal? - No. I didn't steal. Then how did you get this bag and money? Jaggu gave it to me. Who is Jaggu? I don't know. I didn't steal. I'm not a thief. Your Honor, the stolen goods found... with the boy is important evidence. To defend himself, he is naming some imaginary guy named Jaggu. Actually, he's the thief. Your Honor... the stolen goods were definitely found with the boy. But he wasn't caught while committing the theft. Hence, he can't be called a thief. Even if I agree with your suggestion he's not the thief... you can't deny he's not involved with a gang of thieves. Your Honor, even if the boy didn't commit the theft himself... he definitely helped in the theft. And the one who helps the thief is also a thief and criminal You Honor, my learned friend... accepts that some gang is behind this theft. Then how can only this one boy be labeled as the thief? According to the boy's statement... Jaggu gave him this bag and ran away. Hence until Jaggu is presented in this court, the case can't be decided. I'm confident this boy is innocent. I know his uprightness and innocence very well. His character is filled with traits of hooliganism and crookedness. He's an illegitimate child who... has neither any mother nor any father. One can't expect decency from such a child. Your Honor... with the permission of the court, I'd like to state something. Permission granted. I know of this boy's uprightness and innocence. His father's deceit created a deep wound in his heart. One can't expect decency from such a child, because... his father was very decent. This child is illegitimate because... her mother's honor and life were played with as if they were toys. This child is illegitimate because... the one who ruined her mother's life... married some other woman and settled in his life. Your Honor... I recognize that decent person very well... the father of this illegitimate child. And I'm sure that you also must be recognizing... the mother of this child, very well. Sorry Madam, this case is about... - the child and not his parents. - Great! The fault is not of the poison but one who gives the poison. Pardon me, public prosecutor, today's case is not only of the... child but also of his parents. These are those parents who throttled the laws of God. This statement is neither... related to this case nor to this court. This crime is related to every court of the world. I would like to ask the world, what justice is this... that while they commit the sin... this child is called a sinner? Inebriated by the youth, they turn blind... and this child suffers the blows? They commit the mistakes and he undergoes the punishment? While the world respects them, he gets kicked? While this poor soul walks with his head hung in shame... they walk with their heads held high? Mr. Lawyer, your court may pardon such sins... but the court of God will never pardon them. Children are not bastards, oh lawyer. Rather the parents are bastards. You are a criminal. The consequences of your deeds are reflected in the form of my ruin. Instead of giving respect to a woman, you threw her in the ditch... of helplessness and shame. Today in her tears, your prestige and name are being drowned. Her sighs of pain have ruined my motherhood. You left Roshan and Ramesh left us. The sighs of that innocent child set fire to my happiness. God punished me for your sin. You're going? Because you're the mother of that child? Because you've kept me in the dark till now? If you'd wanted, you could have hidden this secret from me forever. But you didn't do that. To save your child, you accepted this. And took the blame of someone else's sin on yourself. Meena, today you've grown in my eyes even more. Because today, humanity has arisen in you. For the welfare of a child, you didn't care for your own life. Go and bring that child to this house. Will you be able to accept Roshan as Ramesh? Why not? It's my duty to accept all that is yours. All your goodness is my goodness... and all your weaknesses are my weaknesses. The mistake which you and Meena committed... might have been committed by anyone. But the real person is the one who realizes his mistakes. The one who can atone for his sins. Go and bring Roshan and illuminate this... house again, which is filled with darkness. But how to go before him? What should I tell to him? That, son... I am that father of yours... who filled your life with darkness, before you even opened your eyes. Now you come and illuminate my house. I won't be able to do this, Malti. I won't be able to do this Uncle, I'll never do anything bad again. I'll go to school every day. I promise, I won't go near any bad person. I won't even talk to them. You have fallen in bad company. I won't live here. The crooks here will make you one, too. Please forgive me, uncle. I won't listen to anything from you. You brought a bad name to yourself, and to me as well. Go and get the cart right now. I'm asking you to bring the cart. Go. Abdul uncle. You? Yes, Abdul uncle. Judge sir? Not a judge but a criminal, Abdul uncle. Tell me, what brings you here? I've come to take my son Roshan. And what brings you here? I've come to take my son. You've come to take the child? The same child you left to die a product of sin? The one you left in the forest to be eaten by animals? You remember that child today? Today maternal love started to flow in your heart? Today you've come as a mother? And today you've suddenly realized your duty of a father? That sin, that blemish, you're calling him your son today? I ask you, where were you that day when in the jaws of death... he was begging for mercy with his tiny hands spread? When his innocent eyes... were searching for his parents' love in the darkness of the forest. Are you his mother? Are you his father? I am his father and mother. I picked him up from the pathway and held him close to my heart. I slept in the wet but put him to sleep in the dry. For eight years, the one I nurtured with my sweat and blood... you've come to take him? You've come to snatch away the support of my old age? You've come to rob me of my wealth in my old age? Get out of here, both of you! You have no claim on him! I have the claim. I have the claim. You're right, Abdul uncle. You have the right to Roshan. The one who nurtures has more right than the one who gives birth. If you know this, then why have you come? To correct my mistake. To repent of my deeds. But why should I repent by giving him to you? I didn't commit any mistake. Was it my mistake that I nurtured and raised him? Was it my mistake that for his happiness... I didn't see the difference between the day and the night. I won't give him to anyone. He's mine. He's my son. You murdered the duty of a father... and you put the maternal love to shame. Abdul uncle... I'm a woman... and for a woman there can't be a greater punishment... than her trust being crushed in the guise of a promise of marriage. That her love is snubbed. Abdul uncle, helplessness and the taunts of society... crushed the maternal bond under the burden of cruelty. Not the social law, Meena... but the unfaithfulness of the man. I, I compelled you to throttle your maternal love. Meena, I'm the guilty one. I'm the one to be blamed. If possible, please forgive me, Meena. Social laws couldn't give me any punishment. But the law of God and the cries of a woman... have given me such a punishment... that today I'm yearning for a child. That means, you also need the child. But so does she. I don't know what to do. Even if I keep a stone on my heart and give Roshan away, but to whom? Given to you, he gets no mother. Given to you, he gets no father. So tell me, what should I do? You're a judge, make a decision. What decision can the accused make, Abdul uncle? Justice is in the guilty being punished. The punishment for my crime is that... I should yearn for a child all my life... and die childless. You give Roshan to Meena. Sir, he still doesn't get the father. People will still call him illegitimate... and raise their fingers to him. No one will raise any finger at him. No one will call him illegitimate. - I'm his father. - Mr. Advocate? I'm right, Abdul uncle. Meena's son is my son. I'm his father. You are a human being in true spirit. Uncle... Uncle, the cart. Son, you used to ask who is your mother, who is your father? Today, they've come to take you. I won't go with them. I'll stay with you. With you. Son, they're your parents. What relation do you have with me? I was just a medium to unite you with them. I was just your gardener, Roshan. They're your parents. You're a light of their house and not mine. Uncle... Son, I feel very sorry for the fact... that I could neither feed you well nor could dress you well. I raised you in the tatters of poverty. Except for love, I couldn't give you anything. Son, you will get love, comfort, name and prestige. You'll receive a good education and a bright future. They can give you everything. I can't give you anything. Uncle, are you crying? No son, where am I crying? I'm very happy today, very happy... that you're going to your parents' house. You are going to bring light to their house. I raised you for this very day, son. The lamps of your memories will always... remain lit in my house filled with darkness. Son, your voice will always echo in my ears. Uncle... Meena Devi, I nurtured this plant... by giving him the love of both father and mother. Take him and adorn your house with him. May God nurture him to great heights... and you too also remain happy and content being with him. - Go son. - I won't go with them. I'll stay with you. With you. Go son. After getting you, I had forgotten everything. I had forgotten even my God. Give me a chance to remember Him. Let me pray to Him. Go, go to your mother. But where will you go, uncle? You will stay with us, Abdul uncle. No dear. I'm going on the Holy Pilgrimage of Haj. I'm going to the abode of the Lord. I am going so far... where my feet don't stumble because of someone's love. There, too, I will pray for your welfare. May God bless you all. May you always remain happy. After considering everything to be own, for sometime... now I depart I return your world to you Now I depart
