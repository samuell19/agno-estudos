Sorry to interrupt. Let's do the craft, thank you. You know one of those devices that holds the chest open? - What're they called? - Chest springer. Chest...? Chest springer, okay. Yeah, one of those from 1816, please. What's extraordinary about working on it is that you realize it's timeless. It will be here a long time after we're all gone. Because it swims into focus depending on different issues. Either in a very specific way, like genetics or cloning, or in a very general way about what man is capable of, and what are the repercussions of the events. There's no time to explain, the simple fact is I built a man. - You did what? - I built a man and succeeded in animating him! - You mean bringing him to life? - Yes. Bringing him to life, my creature, I brought him to life! I think Mary Shelley was writing almost without appreciating it a sort of creation myth for the science age. In many culture there are creation myths but they always involve a deity, a cosmic power, something sets the spark of life in motion, and we humans come to life. The first time Mary Shelley comes up with a creation myth which doesn't involve a deity, doesn't involve cosmic power, but involves solely the skills of humankind. That's why I think it stays with us now, because God doesn't play a very big part in our rationalization about the world we live in and what we're gonna do with it, and the extent to which we're destroying it, as we blatantly are. Mary Shelley is a very literate, highly educated, young, 18-19 year old woman when she comes to it. And the book is stuff full of ideas which seem to me to remain very pertinent to us now. - How does it feel, to be in love? - It... it feels like... ...all the life is bubbling up inside me and spilling from my mouth, it feels like my lungs are on fire and my heart is a hammer! It feels like I could do anything in the world! The most important thing about the production, hopefully, is that it gives the Creature a voice, and I think a lot of people coming to it won't know the novel but they will know the movies which robs him of his voice. The movies just waded in there and robbed him of his voice straight away. And yet, that is the most extraordinary thing. So Nick's approach was to begin with the point of view of the Creature. You abandoned me. It speaks. Yes, Frankenstein. - "It" speaks. - You know my name. We decided to enhance this idea of the creator and the created by getting a couple of great actors to swap the parts. Literally, one night they would be the created creature, and next night they'd become the creator, the scientist, Frankenstein. If you can find the right two actors who can approach it in the right way, they feed off each other, they're challenging each other the whole time, and of course that is a mirror of the relationship of Victor and the Creature. Take my hand, we seal the bargain. What I started to notice, yesterday actually, that quips of my Creature - go into Victor. - Yeah. My Creature has a stammer and a stutter slightly, and I have some of that come into Victor at the end. I've met stroke victims in recovery, people who had severe injuries by being in wars or car crashes trying to reeducate their limbs, their bodies, and when you see that happening, the amount of vulnerability... ...it's a very endearing thing to watch evolve, you really care for him. There's a lot of my two-year-old in the Creature. It's a blank canvas as a body, but the brain works extremely fast, it's a fully grown brain, so it's absorbing everything super quick. The learning comes really quickly. It's alive. It's alive! I think it endures because we want to know who made us, really. And how far back does that process of being made go. Does it go right back to God, does it go just to the point of sexual union or is there something you can interfere with? That's why we're obsessed with it. I... no, no... Keep away! No! You do as I say! Come on! Give me what I paid for, now! Come on, you scum! Oh, thank you, sir! Thank you! One good turn deserves another. Wanna come with me? I've got wine, we can drink. What's your name? I'm Gretel. What are you playing at? Give us a little kiss, at least... Christ! I'm not gonna scream. I'm just gonna walk away. All right, mister? Just walking away. All right? - Klaus? Where are you? - Over here. Come and get warm! I will. - What's in the pot? - What's left of the rabbit. - Where'd you get to? - Ingolstadt. - Any luck? - No. They're jittery as hell. The women and children are locked indoors, the men go armed with cudgels, what's going on? Scared of their own shadows they are in Ingolstadt. Tomorrow we'll move on. - Try and beg some bread. - This is all right, though. Nice bit of rabbit. A man needs bread. I met a woman in Augsburg once, her husband was a baker. I hung around Augsburg for a very long time. - Nice place, Augsburg. - Very nice place. Welcoming. What's that? - What is it? - I don't know. Piss off! Bugger off! Watch out! Run, quick! - But the food... - Leave it, Gustav! - Look at the state of it! - A monster! - Piss off! Bugger off! - Run! - There he is. - Get him! - I'll teach you to scare us! - Eat our supper! Now piss off, you ugly bastard! And don't come back! I'm leaving your food on the table, and there's some milk. Thank you, my dear. - You treat me well. - We're off to work now, Father. Should be back by nightfall. And you behave yourself while we're gone. I'll try. Have you managed to clear the top field? No. Slow progress. Harder than we thought but we'll win in the end. We have to grow something or we'll starve! We'll get faster when we know what we're doing! In a year or two we'll be fine. We'll be farmers. I never thought I'd be a farmer. You ready? For the cold and the mud? Can't wait! - Bye, old man. - Bye, Father! Goodbye, Felix. - You married a lovely girl. - I know. Bye! How do you manage to stay so cheerful? What choice is there? This is where we've ended up, and this is what we have to do. - Come on! - Wait, Agatha. Do you know how beautiful you are? - I swear I will love you forever. - You'd better! When will you give me a son? - Beautiful wife? - Come! We've work to do. Take the food, if you want it. There's nothing else worth taking. There are books, I suppose. At least they have left me my books. You've no reason to harm me. I won't hurt you. I can't see you! I don't fight on any side. Go on, citizen... Take the food. Can't you talk? Maybe you can't, it's nothing to be ashamed of. Look at me! I'm blind! There was a cannonball, and I... I went blind. Now my son looks after me. You look after them when they're little, they look after you when you're old. That's the way it is. But we fell on hard times when the soldiers came through. When people are not oppressed they're full of brotherly love. But when times are hard, then you find out who your friends are, don't you? Piss off! Bugger off! - I beg your pardon? - Piss off, bugger off! You want some music? You want some more music? Music. It's a gift from God. Go on, say it. Mu-sic. You see? You pluck the strings, like this... Look at the stones, the field's full of them! So sorry, Agatha, it has to be cleared. Can't plough until it's done. Oh, well. The sooner we start... P... A... R... A... D... I... S... E... Para... dise. - Paradise. - Paradise. - Write it out. - Paradise. I like, nice word. Don't be afraid. This is how I see. Please. My... You have been in the wars. What happened to you? Where are you from? Where are your mother and father? Paradise. Felix... Felix! - Felix! - What is it? - Look! - What? - Just look! - What is... - But that's... - Incredible! It's a miracle! Every stone is gone, every one! - We can till the soil. - We can sow! Help me fetch up the plough. Quickly! White! What? White what? - Where? - In the air! That's snow. It's nothing interesting. A natural phenomenon, no more. Now please, stop beating about, we need to concentrate. Sit, boy! We've work to do. Thank you. Today: original sin. Original sin. There are two schools of thought. One says that we are all made imperfect, and require the assistance of a higher authority, a deity, to overcome the sin of being born. The other school of thought, to which I subscribe, insists that when we leave the womb, we are pure. That a babe in arms is untainted by sin, that evil is the product of social forces, and that God has nothing to do with how a man turns out, be it good or be it bad. My not do bad things. I know you do not do bad things. You have a good heart. I know that. - Why my hungry? - Eh? Why my hungry? Why no food for me? - I give you half of my food. - Still hungry. It is the condition of men to be hungry. Not kings, not emperors. You're learning fast. - Why my not a king? - I don't know. - Perhaps you are. - Yes, King. Is my name? - I don't know! - King what? You've never told me your name. Not know, never had. - You're a poor, lost thing. - Lost thing. But I have taught you how to speak, how to read... there is hope! Who knows what you may accomplish? Hate me. - Who does? - Men. Women. Childs. Dogs. - No, they don't! - Throw stones, beat me everywhere! Peasants are ignorant people. They do not read like you and I. It's an instinct to protect their home, their family. Perhaps they are frightened of you. My look bad. Not like Agatha. - Agatha? - Beautiful wife. Well, Agatha is beautiful, certainly. And Felix is kind. - Let me introduce you to them! - No. - Why not? - Hate me. No, they don't. They've never met you. Stay and greet them when they come home! Snow, snow, snow! - Snow! - Agatha! - Agatha, look what I found! - And me, look what I found! Look, it's all chopped, ready for the fire, it was lying there at the top of the field. These were left on the stove, the hare's already gutted, not a mark on the birds. - How were they caught, then? - It's a msytery. Who's doing this, Felix? - Well, someone wants to help us... - But who? Who would do that? We're strangers here. Fairy-folk. Fairy-folk? Little people. You know, elves and sprite. Come here. Hello. You there? Is anybody watching? Come out, if you are. We'd... We'd like to thank you. Please? Please come out. - They won't come out. - There's nobody there, you fool! It's just us. You see, we stick together through thick and thin, and never stop loving each other... ...and magical things happen. Father! Father! The evenings grow warmer. Soon it will be spring. - There's a cheery thought. - Why? Well, spring, you know... Spring makes you happy? Why? Well, we're still alive. Why, how long are we meant to be alive for? Let's turn for home now, it's getting dark. How can you tell? You have no eyes! Hear that bird? It's a nightingale. That means it's getting dark. The bird makes the dark? That is impossible. No, my friend, no! Don't you remember your Milton? - "The wakeful nightingale..." - "The wakeful nightingale" "she all night long her amorous descant sung;" "silence was pleas'd: then glow'd the firmament" "with living sapphires: Hesperus that led the starrie host," "rode brightest, till the moon..." "...rising in clouded majesty, at length apparent queen" "unvaild her peerless light, and o're the dark her silver mantle threw." It is night in the Garden of Eden. - Do you see the moon? - Yes, I see it. Describe it to me. - Solitary. - That's a good word, good. Sad like me. - Why is it sad? - Because it is solitary. Why are you sad? Because with all that I read, all that I learn, I discover how much I do not know. Ideas batter me like hailstones, questions but no answers, who am I, where am I from, do I have a family? You have us! My son will not turn you away, I promise you. Come along and say hello to him. - No, no. - Why not? It's a simple request. Do not request it again! I have been reading Plutarch: Lives of the Emperors. Oh, yes. The founders of ancient Rome. Men who showed that the world could be improved! Why do men live in herds in cities? I cannot imagine Rome, I cannot imagine a city, their numbers are too great. We band together to help one another and do good. But then you massacre each other! Yes, it is inconsistent. I do not like inconsistent. Why must it be so? I don't know, that's the way it is. How do I find out the way that it is? - I don't know... - Oh, De Lacey, all the time you say you do not know but you do. Why do you grasp everything and I nothing? Why must I learn it all when it flies to you on the wind? I am the one who stands outside the door, I see inside but I daren't go in. What is it exactly that frightens you? Everything, everything. Why do you live in a hut in the woods, why not a great city? - Because I am poor. - Why? Because an army came by and ransacked my university. We were driven from the town. - Am I poor? - Yes. One day though you'll find someone who'll make you the wealthiest man in creation. - Will I? - Yes. A good man deserves it. You are a good man. Someone will love you, whoever you are. What is love? "Awake..." "My fairest, my espoused, my latest found," "Heaven's last best gift, my ever new delight!" "Awake." I ran from a building, it was dark, I was frightened. Is that all you can remember? I do not know how to remember. But you have a memory, you have remembrance. How is it done? What is the process? - I don't know how it is done. - Then how am I doing it? I do not know. You ran from a building and this was in Ingolstadt, but the author of this journal says he's from... Geneva. Citizen of Geneva, Victor Frankenstein. - Citizen of Geneva. - Frankenstein... Where is Geneva? To the south and west, many days' ride. Read on. "Preparing a frame for the experiment" "with all its... intricacies" "of fibers, muscles and veins is a work of great difficulty." "Should I attempt the creation of a being like myself" "or one of simpler organisation?" A being like myself? Meaning what? A man or a woman? De Lacey, I see things in my sleep. They're called dreams. - What did you see? - Someone. Her arms were... and her eyes... It was a good dream? It was pleasing. Is that good? A good dream doesn't mean it was morally good, it only means it wasn't a bad dream. There are bad dreams? - Hello! - It's Felix and Agatha! - Stay and meet them. - No, I cannot. These are good people, they're not like the others. I don't know what you look like my friend, but I know there is room in the world for fellowship. Room in the world for love. Prejudice can be overcome! Stay, I will speak for you. - We're finished for the day! - I am here! - Hold my hand. - No, no, I must run... Stay. Trust me, trust me. Stay there, stay. - But they will hate me! - No! - I promise you, no. - Father... This is my friend, he... Good day, sir. - What is it? - Get away from him, you! Get away! Let him go, you devil! Leave my father alone! No, there's nothing wrong! Get out! You get out! Thrush it! Crush it, kill it! You promised! Awful, awful beast! - Are you hurt? - It's all right, you're safe. - We won't leave you again. - He was hungry! He did me no harm. Have you no compassion? - It was a monster! - No man is a monster! - It wasn't a man! - What have I done? Dear God, what have I done? What do they do when they feel like this? Heroes, Romans, emperors... What do they do? I know. They plot... they revenge. I sweep to my revenge! 19, 20, 21... 22, 23, 24... 25, 26... Get ready, everyone! 27, 28, 29, 29 and a half, 30! Ready or not, I'm coming! I'm giddy. You'd better be well hidden! Hello, boy. Don't turn around! What? I said don't turn around, please, don't. Very well, sir. - Where am I? - Near Geneva. - Geneva? - Yes, sir, of the lake. Can't you see it? It's there. The lake... how it glistens. I have come a long way, walking at night, fish in the streams... Do you fish? - Oh, yes! - And what do you catch? What bait do you use? I should go to my friends, we're playing. Guess who I am. Are you from... are you a friend of the family's? Yes! Then you're a judge, or a minister, perhaps! I am a judge. Don't look. - What? - I said don't look at me. I shan't. What's your name? - William. What's yours? - We can be friends, William! We can go hiking, we can climb those mountains over there! - Climb Mont Blanc? - Yes! - Great! - Let's go! No, sorry, I'm not allowed. - Father will be angry! - Forget about him. Come with me! - Let's climb Mont Blanc! - I'd like to, but I can't! Everyone has friends, William, you must be my friend. I have to find my father, let me go! Let me go! I will release you if you answer my question. What is it? I seek a man called Frankenstein, have you heard of him? That's my name. You? Frankenstein? - You're ugly, leave me alone! - Victor Frankenstein, - he is your father? - No, Victor's my brother. - Where is he? - He's at home, he's always at home. - Can I see him? - No, of course you can't! We must be friends, William, everyone has friends. We will go climbing in those mountains - after you take me to see Victor. - No, you're revolting! What is he? What does he do? - He's a scholar, a genius. - Was he ever in Ingolstadt? Yes, he studied there. He's come home to marry Elizabeth. But he's silly, he never leaves his room, he's missing everything. You will bring him to me. - Come. - No, I shan't! Come! My father's a magistrate! He'll punish you for this! - You're going to prison! - Quiet! William! - William! - William! This is where you were playing? Yes, we were hiding. He was coming to find us. - Where were you hiding? - Down at the boathouse. - Did you see anything? - No, nothing. - Heard nothing? - He was calling out. I thought it was part of the game. William! William! Divide into teams! You and you, come with me! They are looking, everyone is looking, you may go home. But William's missing, how long has it been? Since this afternoon but you may go home. I have a duty to help, father. Victor, it doesn't help anybody when you become agitated. He's my brother, let me join the search, I must! Over here! Monsieur Frankenstein, look at this. - It's William's hat. - What was he doing here? We were playing hide and seek. - And you didn't keep him in view? - I was hiding from him. How could I keep him in view? - Where were you? - Well, where were you? Locked in your study, I suppose. William was not my responsibility, he was yours! So you have responsibility for what, exactly? Enough! The villagers are saying, Clarice? They say they've seen a beast in the mountains, sir. - Beast? What kind of a beast? - A monster! Tall as a pine tree! They say it breathes blue fire. And you think this thing took William? Well, someone took him, he can't be found. No one knows what's up in those mountains. I know what's up those mountains. Snow and ice! And a bit more snow and ice, that's all. Spread out, keep looking! He may be nearby. - William! - William! Monster? What do they mean, a monster? They've seen some sort of animal, presumably. They didn't say animal, they said a monster, a creature. Folk-tales. Who exactly saw it? I don't know. Does it matter? Victor... you don't look well. I haven't seen you for weeks, you're always up in your room. Why do you want to see me? We're supposed to be getting married. - So I'm expected to... - Talk to me occasionally, yes. What if I haven't got anything to say? What am I meant to do then? - What is it? - A boat, drifting against the current. That's impossible! - Against the wind? - Is someone pulling it? - No, no one! - Is there anyone aboard? Haul it in! - William! - Is it the child? Oh, please, no. He's... dead, Father. - Is it him? - Angels in heaven, little William... Have mercy on his soul. My boy... let me see him. Carry him. Sound the bell! My son is dead. What are those papers? Victor, it looks like your hand! These are diagrams, equations. University work. What are they doing here? It seems they are pages from my journal. - Where is your journal? - I don't know. I lost it. - I don't know where it is! - Victor! Are you here? Where are you? Are you here? Where are you? You show yourself, you monstrous thing! God... Muscular coordination, hand and eye... ...and a perfect balance! Excellent tissue, the sutures have held! I failed to make it handsome but I gave it strength and grace! What an achievement! Unsurpassed in scientific endeavour! My God, the madness of that night... the heat, the sweat, the infusions... The moment I saw it crawl towards me and I... - You ran away. - What? You abandoned me. - It speaks! - Yes, Frankenstein. - "It" speaks. - You know my name. - My journal. - Why did you abandon me? I was terrified... what had I done... - Built a man and given him life! - Now I've come to take it away. - Have you? - I've come to kill you. Kill me? Then why did you create me? To prove that I could. - So you make sport with my life? - In the cause of science! You are my greatest experiment, but an experiment that has gone wrong. An experiment that must be curtailed. Be still, genius. - I have a request. - Damn you, you can't have requests! Oh, I can. Listen to me. - It is your duty. - I have no duty to a murderer! If I am a murderer, you made me one. You killed my brother, you did it, not me! I curse the day you drew breath. Since then I've lived in darkness. "Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime," "said then the lost Arch-Angel," "this the seat that we must change for Heav'n," "this mournful gloom for that celestial light?" That's Paradise Lost. You've read Paradise Lost? I liked it. Why? You saw yourself as Adam? I should be Adam, God was proud of Adam. But Satan is the one I sympathise with. For like Satan, I was driven out though I did no wrong, and when I see others content, I feel the bile rise in my throat, and it tastes like Satan's bile. This is remarkable, you are educated, you have memory. Yes, I use it to remember being hunted like a rat! Running from human places, finding refuge in the woods. I use it to remember being beaten and whipped and I was good. - I wanted to be good. - Then why did you kill William? I wished to see you and you came. Would you have come otherwise if I had killed half of Ingolstadt? Would you have come? Did no one show you kindness? There was an old man, he taught me many things, but he was blind, he never saw my face. He did not know that I looked like this. After a year had gone by, after he had described to me the seasons, I watched them go round, 1-2-3-4, when I was one year old, he said they would take me in. His son and his wife, beautiful wife. What happened? - You know what happened. - Oh, God, I do. - I burnt them in a fire! - Sorry, I am... Sorry? You are sorry? You caused this! This is your universe, Frankenstein! Here is my request. I wish to be part of society, but no human being will associate with me, but one of my own kind, one just as deformed and horrible, she would understand... - She? What? - I want a female built like me! - A female? - You did this! - You alone have the power to... - To create another monster, another brute? No, I will not. - It is my right! - You have no rights. You are a slave! You want me to build you a female so that the pair of you could be wicked together? No, I will not. Torture me as much as you like, I'll never consent. I will not torture you. I will reason with you. Isn't that what we're supposed to do? Have a dialogue? There is no dialogue with killers. Yet you'd kill me if you could, you have just tried! Why is your killing justified and mine is not? I will not argue with you, I can't. I'm halfway up a mountain, debating with a... - A living creature. - A nothing! A filthy mess of nothing! I am your master, you should show respect. A master has duties. You left me to die. I am not a slave, I am free! If you deny my request, I will make you my enemy. I will work at your destruction. I will dedicate myself, I will not rest until I desolate your heart! I apologise, I did intend to reason. I am capable of logic. I do not think what I ask is immoderate. A creature of another sex but as hideous as me. If you consent, we will disappear together, we will go to the wilds of South America, we will build our little Paradise, and live there in peace and no human being will see us again. - What do you say? - I'm amazed you've learnt so much, so fast. - Are you proud of me? - Proud? No. Why not? - Because your logic is flawed. - Is it? You say you'll go abroad and disappear, yet you also say you yearn to be accepted by society. Won't you grow tired of exile? Won't you return and try once more to live amongst people, only to meet with their detestation? Because that is what you will meet with. Only now, when you run wild, there will be two of you, and double the destruction. Why should I facilitate this? Because I am lonely! Every creature has a mate, every... bird in the sky, even you are to be married. Why would you deny me the comforts you allow yourself? A moment ago you were amazed at my intellect, but now you harden your heart! Please, do not be inconsistent. I find it infuriating. All I ask is the possibility of love. - Love? - Yes. - You think it is a possibility? - Yes. - For you? - A good man deserves it. - Are you a good man? - I would be, I would be. I regret that you are lonely, - I did not foresee that... - That I might have feelings? You were an equation! A therum, I confess it! A puzzle to be solved! But if you are sentient, and you will depart... Frankenstein, if you build me a companion, I will quit Europe forever, I will vanish into air, there will be no more destruction, - I will be gone. - Do you swear to be peaceful? Yes, I beg you to believe me. If you gave me your word that you'd leave here forever, and never return, never, if you swear and swear solemnly! I swear by the blue sky, by the white snow, by the fire of love that burns in my heart, that if you grant my request, you will never have to look on me again for as long as the world turns around. - You think it turns round? - Yes, of course. You must understand, the work is hard. You alone can do it, you alone have the skill. I alone in the whole world and no one to share the secret. Down there, do you see them? Little men with their little lives. - Little houses, little men! - I am different. You are a king, the King of Science! Build me a woman, please, I beg you, a bride! A bride should be beautiful. She should have pretty eyes, shining hair, she should not be hideous, she should be as lovely as possible. I will not repeat my mistakes, we can only go forwards, we can never go back. Master, work your magic once more. - I beg of you... - A female, I haven't even considered the question, there are differences of... of anatomy, of course, but also differences of what? - Temperament, humour, skill... - I don't know... - What are females good at? - I don't know! What a challenge! If I could build something immaculate, something I could exhibit... Not a demon, but a goddess. A goddess. She, who's indistinguishable, she, who's... perfect. Imagine that. I may be damned, but I'll attempt it. - You will comply with my request? - I will comply with your request. If you give me your word that afterward you will leave us be. I will, if you give me your word that you will do it. What is that for? You shake it. - I shake it? - We seal the bargain, take my hand. Thank you, thank you, my dream's come true! Go home and begin your work at once! - Home? I can't do it at home. - Why not? What happens at home? Do this work in my father's house? No. Then go where you need to. I will be watching! Your post, sir. Letters of condolence. The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. I know, Clarice, I know. Count. Victor, where have you been? In the mountains, on a sea of ice. This is a house of death, it is no time to go adventuring! Father, I have to make a long journey, - I leave today. - Today? What about William? He isn't coming. - I must travel to England, goodbye. - England? Why? - Work. - What work? For a year I haven't seen you work, what is this work for which you must decamp to England? - I don't expect you to understand... - No, I don't understand. I don't believe your studies are so important and I order you to remain here for the funeral. I have no intention of obeying, I must go. And your wedding? - It'll have to be postponed. - And Elizabeth? Elizabeth will wait. I was in Ingolstadt for six years, a little longer won't make much difference. Victor, why are you so sad? - When your mother was dying... - Please, don't bring her into this! When your mother was dying, I gave a promise that I would see you wed your cousin Elizabeth. That was my wife's last wish. That you might be happily married. You were such a brilliant child, a carefree child, alert and inquisitive, the joy of our days... I came to believe you would do great things and I'd be proud of you. Instead we have this sullennes, this melancholy, this low fog of gloom. You flog my authority, you do not respect the codes by which we live! If you insist on leaving, I cannot stop you, but you can tell your fiancée yourself. Elizabeth! Where is the boy I remember? Where is he, Victor? Where has he gone? Your father tells me you're leaving us. Why Victor? Why must you go to England? Because in England they're at the forefront of electrochemistry. I've heard of real breakthroughs by vitalists, calvinists... I must go and see for myself. And for that you'd put off our wedding. Yes. It's critical for my experiments. What are your experiments? I'd say that they're beyond a woman's scope. Which part might be beyond my scope? All of it, actually. Are you suggesting I'm less intelligent than you? Yes. - I mean, less educated. - That's hardly my fault. I wasn't allowed to go to school. But I can learn, Victor. I could be your assistant. What is a voltaic pile, a Leyden jar, electric eggs? You know perfectly well I don't know. What is a voltaic pile? It's for storing an electrostatic charge, linking several jars in parallel... Oh, please, take me with you! - It sounds so exciting. - I will go first to Oxford. Spend several months at the University. Believe me, there is nothing exciting about that. - I don't care, I'll come. - I'll be in the library all day! I'll be as quiet as a mouse. Let me come. Subsequently, I'll travel to the islands of Scotland, barren rocks in a barren ocean, it is, I am told, an awful place. I don't care, we'll be together! Elizabeth, it's no situation for a woman! And you think this is? The world is turning, Victor, and I'm sitting in Switzerland watching it. I know it's picturesque, the mountains, the lake, but it's so quiet, it's oppressive. And the people are dull. I want to go to Paris, Rome, America. I want to talk to you about your work, about the world, about music, politics. - Everything. - I have no interest in music or politics. Have you any interest in me? Elizabeth, you are... ...beautiful, you will make a beautiful wife. Victor, what do you think I am? A specimen? May I ask you something? I want to have children. Do you want to have children? - Yes, of course, I... - No, do you want to give me children? God willing, yes I do. Then show me how you'll give me children. Kiss me, Victor. Touch me. Feel my heartbeat. Must you go? Can't you stay? I wish I could stay but I cannot. Then go and do your work! And be brilliant. And after that come home to me, and be my husband, and give me a dozen children. Go. Thank you. Is the weather always like this? This is quite a nice day. It's not much of a croft, sir. The roof is poor. - Will you be all right here? - For my needs, it's fine. Your wife can bring me some food. She can, sir. But it's simple, fish mainly. We don't touch meat, do we, Rab? Unless it swims, we don't eat it. Eggs? We eat eggs. That's the exception, eggs. - And oatcakes, carrots... - Yeah, all right. Where do you want it, sir? Set it down there. Thank you, gentlemen. Here's the price we agreed for the porterage and three months' rent. But I would be prepared to give you very much more, Ewan. If you could perform another service for me. My field, you see, is anatomy. The human body. To progress my research, I require certain materials. It's an unorthodox discipline, and it is... somewhat disapproved of in academic circles, but you have my word that it is for the public good. Ooh, I don't like the sound of that. Quiet, Rab! We don't move in academic circles. Go on, sir. It's illegal, I take it? We're a long way from any court of law. The nights are dark... ...and in science we keep our secrets. What is it you want? - Human remains. Fresh. - He's a surgeon! I knew it! Here, that's grave-robbing! We are Christians in the Orkneys, sir, we don't rob the dead in a grave. The dead are dead, aren't they? They're not coming back. I don't subscribe to the view that it's unethical to use them for medical research. - No, nor do I. - Just think! What would be possible in the future, eh, Rab? Shall we gain the upper hand over sickness and disease? Have you any idea what we will be capable of if brilliant men are allowed to do our work? Uncle Ewan! Quiet, Rab! I'll do nothing on my own island. But what is it exactly that you're after? Have you heard of any young woman who has died very recently? - Aye, on Ronaldsay. - Not your kin? - No, not my kin. - Not diseased? Drowned. May God have mercy on her. A good looking lass, she was. Rab liked her. - I did not! - You did! - I liked her sister. - She was beautiful? - Not bad. - Good. Are you prepared to work to my exact specifications? - Well, Rab, he can't read. - I can read! - Do him a drawing! - Uncle Ewan... You... will do as the gentleman says. How far is it to Ronaldsay? - Is she in? - There's a bit sticking out. - Well, what is it? - I don't know! It's a girl! Come on, laddie! Push! She's in. You have strange taste, Rab, that's all I can say. - I find her terribly skinny. - I said, the sister! The sister is fatter! - Uncle Ewan. - Aye? What's he going to do? I don't know. - This is not right, Uncle Ewan. - As the man said, they're dead. They're not coming back! - You ready? - Aye. Heave! - Have you got it? - Jesus Christ! - Aye, sir. - Haul it to the boat. - This is only the first, Ewan. - Is it, sir? I shall need a regular supply of internal organs. Very good, sir. Organs?! Quiet, Rab! Meat for the dogs. Nothing you're not familiar with. Now come on! Uncle Ewan! Is this how I was formed? Stolen at night from wet soil? Made out of meat for the dogs? Even I can feel disgust. And will he fashion me beauty from this filth? And will I want her? Stinking of death? Wait! Come. Here you are, sir. Thank you, Ewan. This will be the last. Thank you for all your assistance. - You will be leaving our island soon, sir? - Soon. - Have I done you good service? - Excellent service, yes. And the food was all right? The food was unbelievable. Sir, you're not looking too marvellous, if you don't mind my saying. I'm tired, that's all. My work is nearly done. And let me tell you, I think I can say, I have excelled! I'm very pleased to hear it. Farewell to sickness and disease! - Goodbye, Ewan. - Goodbye, sir. William! So how do you do it? It's late, you should be in bed. How do you bring dead things to life? - Is it easy? - No, it's hard. - Some kind of miracle. - Tell me the secret! - When did you start? - At school. Did you bring the teachers to life? That would be a miracle. The school was so boring, I wanted to find out why things exist, how things exist, not absurd divinity and idiotic music, the laws of existence! So I started to read forbidden books. - Agrippa, Paracelsus... - The alchemists? Yes! They were true men of science, they mapped the heavens, they tracked the course of the stars... They classified the air we breathe, the circulation of our blood. All modern medicine comes from them. I too wished to penetrate Nature to lay bare her deepest mysteries. So I studied mathematics, experimented with galvinism... - What's that? - You induce spasms in inanimate flesh, using a current from a chloride battery... - Great! - ...where a zinc plate's laid on a solution of ammonium chloride and Ceylon moss, and... - How thrilling! - ...as I watched the current arc between bismuth and antimony, I found myself asking: Where does the principle of life, the actual spark of life itself, where does it come from? - It comes from God. - Yes. - But only from God? - I don't know. - Can a man be a god? - I don't know! Well, I had to find out! - So off to the graveyard I went. - Oh, Victor, yuck! I watched their flesh rot in the soil, I watched worms eat eyes, maggots chew the tissue of the brain. I went to executions and charnel houses, I studied the moment of change from life to death, the specificity of the moment, the annihilation of the spark, until suddenly, months later, in this fever of creativity, I found that I could indentify and replicate the prime cause of life! What is it? Can't tell you that, Will, you're only little. What are you going to do with it? Don't know. I have travelled where no man has travelled. I wonder how far I can go. I can create people, Will. Living people, look at me! I breathe the breath of God. - Will they reproduce? - What? Will they have wombs, the females? Will they breed? How quickly will they breed? How fast is the cycle? How many in a litter? - Fifty, a hundred, a thousand? - William... And if the children breed with the children? - Will they do your bidding? - What do you say? You are their King... will they do as you tell them? Or they will be bad like the one who killed me? Frankenstein! Where is she? - She's... she's here. - Show me, genius! Wait! Isn't she fine? She is... beautiful! Yes. Your work is so detailed the cuts so fine, - the luster of her skin... - She is perfect. - A perfect wife. - Frankenstein, I admire you! I can't give her to you. Why not? How do I know what will happen if I bring her fully to life? I didn't know how you'd turn out, how dangerous you'd be, how can I know about her? Sir, if it has been possible to me to overcome my disgusting origins and transform myself into a rational being, she, my wife, will do the same. - And if she doesn't? - But she will! I will teach her morality as De Lacey taught me. But you have sworn to live as an outcast. Supposing she prefers the town? She has no choice, we go to Argentina! What if she refuses to accept the bargain made before she was even created? Come on! Use your brain! She might reject you. She might abhor the sight of you, she might take one look at you and run! She might say she prefers to live with a man, not a monster. - Stop talking, you are cruel! - Look at her, look! Exquisitely constructed, don't you agree? Look at those cheeks. Those lips. Look at those breasts, who would not desire those breasts? What if she leaves you? What if she finds someone else? How will you feel if you are rejected by one of your own species? The only one of your own species, the only one you can take to your bed, - how will you react? - I will run mad if she leaves me! - It's a risk then, isn't it? - No, because I'll show her such admiration, such devotion she will never want to leave me. - Is that a risk I should take? - You must, you must. Please, she is mine! Please. Please. - Are you saying you will protect her? - Yes, I will be there, nobody will harm her. - Are you saying you'll love her? - Yes, I will! 'Cause love is not something one can learn, it's not something one can teach, - either you feel it in your soul or... - Master, I love her, I do, I do! Are you telling me you have a soul? Master, say you believe me. How does it feel? To be in love? It feels like... ...all the life is bubbling up and spilling from my mouth, it feels like my lungs are on fire, and my heart is a hammer and that I can do anything in the world! Anything in the world! Is that how it feels? Yes, that is how it feels. Bring her to life and I will cherish her forever. Those are the words I was waiting to hear. You have shown you have some grasp of the emotion we call love. Now be patient! I will complete her. You can help me, we will not send her out into the world in this condition, we will dress her, dress her as a queen. - A queen! - Go to that trunk, it contains some clothes, my fiancée's. Select the finest for your bride. Now let me work! I'll call you when you're needed. I will dress her in lace and velvet, I will give her silk and pearls! I will walk in the garden with my fair, angelic Eve. I will be Adam, she will be Eve! And all the memory of hell will melt like snow. What do you know of the power of love? It is irrational, a pool of unreason, it is anarchic, volatile, vertiginous, mad! Above all, it is uncontrollable! A million of you on the earth, coupling, procreating, no! You are the only one of your species and that is how you'll stay. Awake, awake, my fairest, my espoused! - Awake! - She will never awake! - Sir! Sir, open the door! - Victor, let us in! Frankenstein, you broke your word. You may expect me again. Victor! Victor! - There's something running off! - Jesus Christ, what is it? Victor, open the door! Stay away! - Father... - What in God's name is this place? - Father, you came... - Victor, you were gone too long, we were worried! - You don't know what I've done. - No matter what, boy, come home! I must be married at once! I must marry Elizabeth at once! At once! Please, help me get him to the boat! Take this, destroy it. I want you to promise that it will be destroyed. - Your journal? - Destroy it, burn it! You give me your word as a magistrate, no one must read it again. Give me your word - that it will be destroyed! - I give you my word! Come home! Come, come! What has he been doing here? You man, speak! Medical research, sir. As he said! Medical research... Holy Christ. # The vows are sworn, the know is tied # # The garlands thrown on the groom and bride # # Lift up your voice and raise your wine # # To bless the house of Frankenstein # # Once boy and girl, now man and wife # # We wish them long and fruitful life # # Lift up your voice and raise your wine # # To bless the house of Fran... # Listen, you can still hear the bells ringing over the water. So you can. Many congratulations, mistress, it was a splendid day. Thank you. Will you please get me ready for bed? Yes, mistress. - I want to look beautiful. - Yes, mistress. - Perhaps then he'll... - I'm sure he will. He never touches me, Clarice. He never comes near. He barely spoke to me after the service. Well, he has always been... peculiar. What have I done wrong? You've done nothing, mistress! Men, you know? They're as nervous as we are on their wedding night. A lot of them have no experience whatever. - I'm not nervous. - I know you're not, mistress. And yet, you don't know what to expect, do you? None of us do, first time. It can come as quite a shock. So just remember: there's no shame in keeping your eyes shut. Some ladies never get used to it, to be perfectly honest. Oh, but I'm sure you will. Here you are, mistress. You look as pretty as a picture. - Where is he? - He'll be along shortly, mistress, you wait and see. Having a glass or two, probably, if he's anything like my husband. He'd put a bag on my head if he could. Come along now, mistress! Let's pop you into bed. First I must pray. That's all. Goodnight, mistress. God bless. - Victor! - Report! - We patrol the roof and the terrace. - We have men down at the lake. Good, wait for me outside, I'll join you presently. Victor... what is going on? The house is secure, there are guards at every door. Why? What is going on? Tell me! - I should've told you before. - Yes, I think you should! It is one of my experiments, Elizabeth. You'll find this hard to credit and there's little time to explain, but... the simple fact is... I've built a man. - You did what? - I've built a man, and succeeded in animating him. - Say that again. - I built a man! Animating him? Do you mean bringing him to life? Yes, bringing him to life, my creature, I brought him to life. Your creature? You don't believe me. Yes! Yes, I do. If you say you have built a creature and brought him to life, then I do believe you, of course. - What is it, like a puppet? - No, a functioning man! - A brute of a man! - But this is ridiculous! You're telling me you've made some sort of creature with your electric eggs, presumably, and it what? - It does what? - Pursues me. Victor, you have been very ill. In Scotland you had a nervous collapse! Look, there is a thing out there and it means to destroy me! I have lured it here and now I must act! I must kill him before he kills me. What do you mean you've lured it here? I knew he would come for... for the... The wedding? Did you send him an invitation? - Victor, he wasn't on the list! - Elizabeth, this is serious! Please, believe me! You're asking me to believe that you have created some sort of monster? - Yes. - Why? I beg your pardon? Why? Why did you do that? Because I had a vision. A vision of... perfection. I followed Nature into her lair, and I stripped her of her secrets, I did it, Elizabeth, I've brought torrents of light into this darkening world, I did it, Elizabeth, I did it. I have never doubted your brilliance. I have beaten Death! I have done it! - I've made a living thing! - But if you wanted to create life... Yes, that's it, that's exactly what I wanted. ...then why not just give me a child? We could've married years ago. - No, no... - Because that is how we create life, Victor. - That is the usual way. - I'm talking about science! No. You're talking about pride. You've been trying God's work. Is that what you're telling me? And it has gone awry. In you I found Paradise... but the apple is eaten. I cannot go back. You've meddled with the natural order and led us into chaos. Because you worship the gods of electricity and gas. What is wrong with you men? There are guards all around the house. I will kill this thing that I foolishly made, - and then I'll come back to you. - Please, don't go. Hold me, please. There's time for that when this is done. I do love you, Elizabeth. Dear God, watch over him. Don't scream! I will not hurt you. Don't scream. I need your help. Can you guess who I am? But he didn't mention what I looked like, did he? Are you curious, Elizabeth? Don't scream. I will release you. Turn around, look at me. I need your help, I have a grievance. - Victor did this? - Do you think he is clever? - A genius! - Yes, that is right. What is your name? My name... What a luxury that would be! He didn't give me one. Touch. What do you feel, Elizabeth? Heat. And here? A heartbeat! Just like yours. Now if you please. We'll have none of that. You say you have a grievance. Madame... your husband is a good man, but he does not keep his word. If you had a child and it looked like me, would you abandon it? I'd never abandon a child. - You're quite sure? - I'm sure. - No matter how repulsive? - I'm sure. Well he did, he left me because I look like this, because I am different. If Victor has treated you poorly, I shall speak to him, you may count on that. Isn't he coming to your bed? He must learn to take responsibility for his actions... Surely, he desires you on your wedding night. ...and that we must always stand up for the disadvantaged. Absolutely, give voice to the oppressed! - Will you put my case? - What is it you want? I did not ask to be born, but once born, I will fight to live! All life is precious, even mine! He promised to give me the one thing I lack, the one thing I need to be content, but then he... ...broke his word. I want a friend, that is all. I'll be your friend... if you let me. Will you? If you need help, let's see what we can do. Sit with me. I will not hurt you, I promise! I am educated... I know right from wrong. Incredible. You are quite extraordinary. - Me? - Yes, you. Perhaps I am a genius, too. Perhaps you are. What are you good at? I am good at the art of assimilation. I have watched and listened and learned, at first I knew nothing, but I studied the ways of men and slowly I learnt how to ruin... how to hate... how to debase... how to humiliate. And at the feet of my master I learnt the highest of human skills, the skill no other creature owns. I finally learnt how to lie. - Lie? - Tonight I have met someone perfect. Thank you for trying to understand, but he broke his word, so I break mine. I am truly sorry, Elizabeth. What do you mean? Victor! No! No! No! No, please, no, please! Please! Victor! Now I am a man! Shoot me! Kill me! Please! Sir? Pick her up! Bring her to my rooms! - Sir, she's dead! - Carry her! - She's gone, sir. - I can bring her back, Clarice! I can bring her back! Quickly, I have the equipment, I can reverse the process, she's still warm, she's lost no blood. - Quickly, there! - Sir, you must prevent him. Stop this at once! She's dead, sir. My dear Elizabeth... gone forever. - No, no! - Cover her. No! I can bring her back! I have the skill! - What do you mean? - I mean resurrect her! Trust me! - What are you saying? - He's gone mad, sir! I'm not mad! I have powers beyond your comprehension, how dare you call me mad? Victor, this is not godly, I cannot bear it! You! Whenever you look behind you, I'll be there! Restrain him! First William, now Elizabeth. - Your mind is disordered! - My mind is superb, it's superb. Take him away! He's monstreous... Oh, dear God. Please, forgive me. - Sir, be still. - What have I brought into this world? You did your best. I failed. My heart is black... It stinks! My mind, once filled with dreams of beauty, is a furnace of revenge! Three years ago when I was born, I laughed for joy at the heat of the sun, I cried at the call of the birds... The world was a cornucopia to me. Now... ...it is a waste of frost and snow. The son becomes the father. The master the slave! I have led him across the Black Sea, through Tartary and Russia, I have led him out past Archangel and on to the ice, we go north, always north! His dogs are dead, his supply's exhausted, but we have a compact we must keep. He lives for my destruction, I live to lead him on. Frankenstein! Come! What is the matter? Are you cold? Do you feel forsaken? Come, great explorer! Look! There's food! Seal-meat! Explorer's food. Come! You wanted power? Look at you! Immortality? Look at you! Why did you treat me like a criminal? - You killed my wife! - You killed mine. You have brought this upon yourself. How? How? Have I? How did I? Did I ask to be created? Did I ask you to make me from some muck in a sack? I am different. I know I am different. I have tried to be the same, but I am different. Why can I not be who I am? Why does humanity detest me? The only one to show pity was Elizabeth. Lovely Elizabeth. I can still taste her strawberry lips, I can still feel her warm breasts, her thighs... I know what I have done. Up, up we go! On, on, on to the pole! Let's make some discoveries! Let's find the source of the magnet! What do you say? Bring light to the darkness! Up! Master, don't tell me you are dead already! Master... Don't you have more stamina than that? Why, we have only just started! Awake! Don't leave me. Don't leave me alone! You and I, we are one! While you live, I live! When you are gone, I must go, too. Master, what is death? What will it feel like? Can I die? Frankenstein, forgive me. My cruelty, please, forgive me. I cannot stop, I'm driven on, the moon draws me on. Solitary moon... But we can only go forward, we can never go back! Drink, master, drink! It is good wine. Drink, drink. All I wanted was your love. I would have loved you with all my heart. My poor creator! Master! You do love me, you do! I don't know what love is. I will teach you! Every chance I had at love I threw away. Every shred of human warmth I cut to pieces. Hatred is what I understand. Only you give me purpose. You I desire. Go on. Walk on. You must be destroyed. Good boy! That's the spirit! Bring my miserable line to an end! Up, up! Come! Scientist! Destroy me! Destroy your creation! Come!
