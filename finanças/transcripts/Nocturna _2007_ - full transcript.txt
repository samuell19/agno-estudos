It's time. Pillow fight! Into bed. Lights out. Come on. Quickly! It's dark... but I'm not afraid. There's nothing to fear. I'm almost there. There he goes again. Some night, you're gonna get caught, Tim! Hi, Adhara. Hey, everybody, Bobby peed in his bed. Shut up! I'm missing a sock. Who took it? Yeah, like somebody would want... your smelly old sock! Hey! That's mine! 10 points! You're gonna get it! Wow! 1, 2, 3. - Hey, pass it! - Yeah! It's Tim. He'll never make it. Oh, no! Look what he did. Tim, you klutz! Sorry. Now you really messed up. Go get the ball, quick! I'm trying. Get it! Get it, Tim! It's in the basement. I'm not going down there. He's kicked it into the basement. Now what? Who's gonna get it? He kicked it down there. He's got to go get it! Come on, scaredy-cat! I can't. There's no light. Come on! I can see the ball from here. You'd better have that ball when you come back... or you'll be in trouble. Don't you dare come back without it! Let's see how he gets out of this one. Where is it? Who took it? Give it back to me! What's the matter? Afraid of the dark? At last. Where are you, Adhara? From here, I don't know where you are. Let's see... There's the North Star. A bit further down is the Little Dipper. Pegasus galloping beside the unicorn... Draco running away from Perseus... and between Orion and the two canis... Lepus... it should be right... there! Hi, Adhara! What's happening? That's imposs-- See? It's not a yellow bat. It's a boy! Are these real? A very rude boy. Sorry. Thank... Thank you for saving me. Hey! Steady on! Listen. The stars... Now, let's see. Which one of you is responsible for this boy? There you are. Tobermory. I should have guessed. Why is this kid still awake? You were napping again. Can't you do your job right for once? Why are you talking to the cats? Why don't you just ask me? And who are you? I'm... I'm Tim. What... Who are you? Do these cats belong to you? Why do you think I'm called the cat shepherd? Tobermory, make him go to sleep. And you be a good boy and get into bed. But that's what I was trying to tell you! I can't go to bed because the window... doesn't open, and I came out here... and now there's a star missing... so I can't go to sleep. What's that? What's missing? My star! Look. Come here. There's my star... Adhara. And now look up. You see? It's not there anymore. I can fix that. You can? There. Now, off to bed! But I can't go to bed until my star is back. Another one just went! Aren't we gonna do anything? "We"? Sorry. Not in my job description. That's Moka. Moka? Who's Moka? Does he know about the stars? Of all the stubborn, obstinate, irritating little... He's the boss, the big guy... the head honcho who runs Nocturna. Nocturna? What's Nocturna? Don't you realize I'm a very busy man? It's not easy being a cat shepherd. I have responsibilities! I have to tell this Moka about the missing star! Impossible. Moka never sees visitors. He will see me! He's far too important! That cat! I'm giving you one more chance, Tobermory. If you can't do your job... I'm kicking you out of the cat herd. Now, make him go to sleep! Feeling a bit drowsy? Annoying noisy cat. Not a little bit? Another star just disappeared! Come on. Just concentrate on the meows. You need to be closer. But why do you want me asleep? Because children, when they're awake... are noisy, irritating, troublesome, distracting... unpredictable, quarrelsome, naughty nuisances... but sleeping children are... perfect. Whatever. I have to see Moka. There's more than one way to make a child go to sl... I'm sorry. This kid is gonna drive me... If I take you to Moka headquarters... will you go to sleep then? OK. Well, hang on. You're gonna wake the whole city up. Stop shouting! And stop digging in your nails. Kids. Here we are... Nocturna headquarters. Can't you wait just one minute? We've got to hurry! We need to talk with Moka. Take it easy, kid. You all wait here. That goes for you, too, Tobermory. It's time you started behaving properly! You just stay put, right behind me. An hour late! Hey, Grandpa, keep your hair on. It's only... Mr. Grandpa to you, young man. Moka is waiting... impatiently! Take it up to his office... now! Do we have to give it to Moka? I mean, the last time... he almost bit our heads off. Well, learn to be punctual... and that won't happen! Whatever, Grandpa. Take it easy. The delivery note. Sign the delivery note! Little troublemakers! What brings you here so... so early? Well, the kid wants to see Moka... and I can't get it into his thick skull... that Moka will see no one. I have to make him go to sleep, but... What are you talking about? About this. But how can... this kid... Know something? Maybe I should take it easy, as well. We work too hard, Grandpa. I'll ask for a holiday. Yeah. That's what I'm gonna do. Wow! Right away! Wait! I need to find Moka. Where is he now? Where has that brat got to? Watch out. Excuse me. It's my first important document... and I mustn't be late. What can I say? I find the rookies really cute. Oh, look. There's one coming now. Yoo-hoo! Oh, isn't that just the cutest thing. Attention. We need more crickets... in Sector 3. Come on, guys! Let's put a bit of rhythm into the night. I don't know what's up... but this don't sound at all like a cricket. We got a lot of dry grass out there, boys. You should have gone at 2100 hours. Cut that out! Save some for the gardens, guys! One more for the road. You sure? This is your second round. I said refill! I know my limits. Dream delivery. Last call for dream delivery. "And then, without knowing how... "you find yourself in the middle... of the classroom in your underwear." What sort of a dream is this? It has no style. The prose is vulgar. It lacks depth. Anyway... I'll let it through... because we have to go to print... and we're short on material. Otherwise... I thought it had appeal. You're tumblers, not tossers. You just push them to the very edge... so that a leg or an arm is hanging off. Let's try again. Oops! Wait! We're full. Wait up! You can't just barge in like this. It just isn't done. Besides, the doorman told me... that Moka is not seeing anyone today. He's very busy. He'll see me. My business is important. Excuse me. Could you tell me how to find Moka? Hey, you. Who let you in? You are unauthorized personnel. Relax. The boy is not dangerous. I found him hanging... Security, I have an intruder in the building. Security? Security! They told me that if it hadn't been for me... There's a security alert. Unauthorized person on premises. You stay put. Why did you call security? Was it really necessary? I was just about to take him back. It's just... See, that's why I don't like this place. Come along with us, sir. But... but I'm not the intruder! It's that pig-headed little boy who's... Not again! Don't let old fatso here out of your sight. He might try something. I ain't going in there. Moka will go ballistic. Remember the last time? The longer you take to give it to him... the worse it will be. What do you mean, the longer I take? You're coming with me. Me? Why sacrifice two of us? You go alone. Excuse me. Could you tell me... how to find Moka? Good luck, kid. Well, it's about time. The coffee pot is nearly empty. What? Just pour the beans in there. - But I... - Move it! I haven't had a drop in the last hour. Are you Moka? The head honcho who runs Nocturna? Well, well, well. What have we here? A boy. So, tell me, what are you here for? I have to speak with you. Speak? No, no, no, no, no. I'm far too busy, far too busy. But it's very important! Let's have a look. I've got a visit from the union... a content meeting... You're in luck. I have a free slot. Two minutes. So, are you going to tell me... or do you prefer to waste your two minutes? Night finishes at 6:00, boy. Well, you see, Mr. Moka... it's about the stars. Stars? I thought you'd come... to report a missing sock... or complain that your sheets get tangled up. Really, it's my star... but not just my star, because... You're a little boy. What have you got to do with the stars? Shouldn't you be in bed? But that's the point! I can't go to sleep because my star has disappeared... and I heard that you're the one... in charge of everything here. Precisely. It's a big job. You have no idea... Tangling sheets, placing bits of fluff... putting sleep in your eyes. For example, look! Do you remember ever waking up... without untidy hair? Or not hearing creaky floorboards at night? You have them to thank for all of that... The loyal, dedicated workers of the night. Everything has to work in perfect harmony... or else it all falls apart... and then what will you have? I don't know. And you don't want to know. It would give you goose bumps. That's why it's so important... about the stars disappearing. You have to do something. I have to? You're telling me what to do? I'm the grand master supervisor... and a little boy... is telling me what to do. You don't seem to understand. I have underlings who take care of little things. Little things? So you mean... that there's someone who's taking care of the stars? Of course, genius. The star keeper. Well, he's not doing a very good job. He's lost 3 of his stars, probably more... and I'm the one sounding the alarm! I give you my valuable time... and you... you come here and tell me... I don't know how to do my job properly? Do you see any kids here? No. Because kids don't solve problems. Kids only eat chocolate, destroy things... and snivel! I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't mean to, but... But you only have to look at the sky... and see for yourself! Someone has to tell the star keeper. I'm not going to give him any notification... and do you know why? Because in my night, there are no mistakes! But I... You've wasted enough of my time. Be sure to sign out at the door. All that coffee can't be good for him. So now what? He swallowed the bait, boss. Excellent work, Pee. Now we'll just have to wait. How can they do this to me? Kicked out of the tower... How humiliating! All thanks to you, Tobermory. Where did I go wrong with you? Instead of inducing sleep, you sleep yourself! And now your boy is on the loose in Moka's tower. Why can't you be like the other cats? Hi, cat shepherd. There you are! Got kicked out... before you got to Moka, I suppose? No. I saw him. Well, then... Remember our deal. I take you to Moka... and then you agree to go to bed. But I can't! I have to... do what Moka told me. And what's that? To... to find the star keeper... and tell him about the missing stars. Moka told you that? Y-y-yes. I think I'll just go up and ask Moka about this. That's not a good idea! Why? He... he's very busy right now... and he said that he... didn't want to be bothered. Oh, don't worry about that. I can get an appointment. But... but look what he gave me... The star keeper's address. What's that you have there? What do you know? An official file. It's true, after all. He is at the lighthouse. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Have you any idea how far that is? It'd take you all night to get there... and that means... I can't afford a blot like that on my record. OK. I'll take you to see the star keeper... but afterwards, you go straight to bed. After all, I've only got... one job left to do tonight. What? I have to put you to sleep. So let's hurry. The night ends at 6 AM. There's no time to waste. "You try to cover yourself as best you can... "but the other children keep on laughing at you... while the teacher"... The dreams they write these days. Really good quality. Wow! What a lot of cats. Are they going to follow us all the way? That shows what you know. Every cat is assigned a child... to watch over during the night... and take care of their sleeping with their meowing. It's a great responsibility. So, mine is Tobermory? Yeah. A comatose cat for an insomniac infant. Perfect match. Look at it. Isn't it beautiful? I don't really like the night. What? You can't mean that! It's dark and spooky and depressing. I don't enjoy it at all. But it's full of wonderful things! The only good things about the night are the stars... and now they're disappearing. Of all the strange, annoying... barbarous children... Silence! We're trying to make music here. What's the matter? It's a Whisperer. You think things happen by accident at night? Pay attention. Wow. So unprofessional! What the... I don't believe it! What? What is it? The cat shepherd is with Tim. What the devil are they doing together? This is not part of the plan. It could ruin everything! Get the cat shepherd away immediately! Boss! Do you want me to do... that? That? Don't even think about it. There's no need for us to go to such extremes. OK, OK. I'll be there... faster than you can say "Psss..." Wasn't bad. Pretty good. I'm exhausted. See you, Jimmy. You were terrific today. Well done. Well done for a beginner. How insensitive! Falling asleep at one of my best concerts. Wake up, you mangy beast! Now what do you have to say about the night? Still think it's depressing? What I will say... is that it's getting darker all the time. We have to hurry! Of course, of course. Come on, guys, let's move it. Where are you all going? What's wrong? Why are you all leaving the pack? What is it? What are you looking at? What is that... thing? I don't know. No! What? It's too dark in here. I need to be where there's light. Please! All right, all right. Calm down. Look... over there. There's a place. You'll be OK here. Wait for me. - But... - Take it easy. I'm only going to tail the pack. Tobermory will stay with you. OK? I'll just be a second, then. Thanks, Tobermory. Oh, hideous! Look at it. Not one tangled strand! She must have brushed it 100 times. Well, what can we do? Well, I was thinking... sort of a prehistoric style. Clumps. I'm seeing clumps. It's a challenge, girls... but I know we're up to it. Now let's get to work! Oh, no. No. Too conventional. No. No. No personality. More clumps. More clumps! Now, now, now... Now it lacks allure. That's not like us! I told you... clumps. Now, that's classy! Now, girls, we've outdone ourselves. Clumps always work. - A boy. - And he's awake! He's seen too much. Hey! Tobermory, help! Look at that. We have to do something about it. No question. Be on the lookout, guys... and try to stay out of trouble. Strange things are happening tonight. I'm counting on you. We can't concentrate. You're tickling me. If you keep still... we'll turn you into... a work of art on legs! There's no time for art tonight. We've got an important mission. Come on, Tim. But he's in our work area! He belongs to us! He's destined to be our... Oh, God, spit it out! Our masterpiece. They think I should change my look. Not tonight. Sorry. Well, maybe we'll see each other again. Someday we'll find him, girls. We will. And then? We'll work wonders with that curl. Shepherd, what was that? The hair messers. They drive me up the wall sometimes. You know what I'm talking about. I know. But I'm sure it has nothing to do with Nocturna. Do you think we're in danger? Danger? Moka makes sure things are in order. We needn't worry. Of course. Moka. There they are! All right, my little ones. You know what you have to do. Go! Quickly! And make your Uncle Pee proud of you! How can you see where you're going? You're always worrying. I could get round Nocturna with my eyes closed. Just wonder why there's so much fog tonight. Look out! Tobermory, are you all right? Cat shepherd? Uh, hello? It's... It's a star! Stop! Wait. I'm not gonna hurt you. I got him! It's the kidnapper! Get him before he gets away! Kid... napper. Kidnapper. Kidnapper! Kidnapper! I'm not the... We got you! Kidnapper! Kidnapper! You won't get away this time. We got you surrounded. Star! What's going on? Star? Who are you calling a star, you little punk? I'll show you who's a star! Nooo! Stop him! Stop that kid! Murray! After him! Don't let him get away! After him! What happened? The boy! Tim! Where are you? Focus. Wait for me, guys. Party time! Stop there. You're not gonna have your way. Just a minute. I said don't move! Good cat. Shame the shepherd's not here. A melon? There he is, boys! Kidnapper! Kidnapper! Kidnapper! The kidnapper! Pulverize him! I didn't mean it. I... Broke his filament! For Murray! Get off me! Foggers, clear this fog! Cat shepherd! You came back for me! Well, I can't have you wandering around awake all night, can I? Looks bad on my record. It's not the kidnapper. It's the big guy! Now, tell me, what's going on? Why are you chasing this boy here? We thought he was the kidnapper. Kidnapper. Kidnapper. Kidnapper. So many of us in the gang have disappeared without a trace! That's why Murray offered to be bait... To catch the kidnapper red-handed. And he'd do it again. Takes more than a little crack to burn me out. Murray! Hooray! Hey, get back, get back. Don't crowd the champ. Murray! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to drop you. I thought you were a star that had fallen from the sky. Hey, hey, hey. Easy mistake. We're luminouses who usually hang around lampposts... and on stoplights... but things have been getting so hot for us... we had to go on the run. So you mean luminouses have been disappearing... Along with stars. Yeah. We're losing our spark. I don't find that funny. Sorry, champ. I could have sworn he was the kidnapper. But you say he's not the one. Moka sent the boy to find out what's happening. That's why we can't stay. We have to move on. Good luck. Sorry about cracking you. No problem! My mother always said... I was a little cracked, anyway. Bye, guys! See you later! See you! I said... just a minute! This is the night report. We're snowed under. Half the city is in darkness, and nobody knows why. There have been complaints from the unions... an increase in accidents through lack of visibility... streets aren't safe... the crickets are about to call a strike... and the knock-downers have simply... stopped knocking down. Forgive me, Sir, but people are asking... a lot of questions about... about the light, and... that shadow. I'm sorry! Questions, questions. And who's gonna answer my questions? Ta-da! Here I am. Well? Finito, boss. Precision job. That is... just marvelous! Couldn't be better. Guess who's very shortly going to have a... Raise? A raise, boss? A problem! What? He's still with the shepherd. How did he do that? I never dreamed I'd have to do this. The time has come for you to do it. Do you really mean... that? Yes. And remember, if you mess up... it could be too late. Enough for today. Down you go, boys. The port is just over there. We'll soon reach the lighthouse. Look how many stars and streetlights... have disappeared now. It's getting so dark! You were right. Something is happening. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. What if all the stars go out? That can't happen. It's impossible. If there were no stars... Then what? Then... I guess... that Nocturna would disappear. And what about you and your cats? Moka and the hair messers? We're all part of Nocturna. But... you can't just disappear like that. I don't want to be on my own again. What's this? You're worrying about us now? I thought you didn't like the night. Anyway, I promise I won't disappear... Not while there are awkward children who won't go to bed. Take it easy. We'll get the stars back to their proper place. They seem to be important to you. Of course they are! Mama told me... that every person has a star. You choose one, and then you... just have to look up at the sky... and see its light. You're never alone at night... because your star is with you... protecting you from the dark. She said it would always be there... but... it's not. Don't worry. I won't leave you on your own. I promise. We'll have the stars shining up there... before dawn breaks. After all, we make a good team. You mean... me and you? Of course! Look how fast you went... in front of that gang of luminouses... and how I stopped them in their tracks. Right, Tobermory? I don't know why I bother. It's pointless. Got you! Hold on, shepherd! Shepherd! Thanks for coming after me. Well, we're a team, aren't we? Yes, I guess. Sort of. Peed in the bed again! It's this way. It's here. The gangway joins the pier to the lighthouse. We'll be there in a snap. So we made it. Almost, mate. I'm beginning to understand... why Moka picked you for this mission. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. Well... Shepherd, I just wanted to say... What is it? Not again. Please. It's your cat pack! What are you doing? You should be in the city. I told you it was dangerous. Why have you followed us? Why are you so nervous? Try to calm down, guys. Calm down! Stop! It's... it's children! Crying! They're all awake! That's why the cats came looking for us. But how? It can't be. Every child is awake! I don't know what's happening. I have to go back. You're going? It's not normal! I have to sort out this disaster. But you can't leave me now. We're really close. Don't you understand? I've got a job to do. What will Moka think if I wander off... and let every child stay awake all night? You're only concerned about your job... and what that Moka thinks! He didn't even listen to me... when I told him about the missing stars. So... the card. He didn't give it to you, right? We're here without his permission. You lied to me. You wouldn't listen to me! You've seen what's happening with the stars and luminouses... and that shadow. We don't know what might happen... if we don't arrive in time. Stay here and don't move. You can't come with me. You said you wouldn't leave me alone. That really was a lie! I'll come for you as soon as I finish... and this time, I'll take you... to where you should have stayed. We're not gonna stay here doing nothing... while the stars are disappearing. We don't need him. We don't need anyone. You two... in there. The rest of you, follow me! There's no time to waste. You... over there, on that balcony. Hurry! Come on, Tobermory. Don't be so lazy! Looks empty. Star keeper? Star keeper. Star keeper! You're not going to believe this... but I think I just saw someone up there. Sure! Sure, Ted. Now, you two, stay where you belong. I think everything is under control now. What are you doing there, girls? Got a problem? A problem? We haven't been able... to undo anyone's hair in peace! All the children have gone crazy! On account of that worm. All right, calm down, calm down. Who are you talking about? Who? Who else? Pee! He's been waking up all the children in the city! One day, I'll wipe that smirk off his face. Pee? But why? I think I'm gonna have to inform Moka about all this. Star keeper? Star keeper! Star keeper! Who's there? Someone came. At last! I was beginning to get a bit frantic. Wow! You're... You're... A star. You're beautiful! Thank you. Most people don't see past my position. What is your position? Why, I'm the North Star, of course. Everyone revolves around me. I'm not bragging. It's literally true. I know. I see you every night... and you keep me company... especially Adhara. She's my star. But she suddenly disappeared. Impossible! Stars don't just disappear. We've been here for thousands of years. I think it's a blackout. We need to use the emergency switches. The emergency switches? All stars have one. Uh! Can't reach it... but right about there is my emergency power switch. See it? We have to tell the star keeper... so he can light you all again. What star keeper? You know... the one who takes care of all you stars... and makes sure you have everything you need. I've been around for millennia, kid, and believe me, men like that don't exist. But... Then who lives in the lighthouse? Nobody. You're the first person I've seen... in the lighthouse in centuries. It's all automatic now, you see. But Moka said... Then I came all this way for nothing? Who's gonna save the stars? What about you? Me? You just have to climb up the gangways... and collect the ones that are not shining. You can be the star keeper. You want us to shine again? Comrades, we are the last remaining luminouses. We should stand united against the enemy... The kidnapper! Kidnapper. Kidnapper. Stupid filament! Kidnapper! He's above! Kidnapper! I don't understand. The switch doesn't work. What's wrong? I don't know! But if they go any longer without shining... that means... they're dead. No. No! That can't happen. Adhara! No! No... This is an emergency summons to all... Nocturians, you must come to the tower immediately. Immediately! No one must remain outside! No one! You must all be very careful! Protect yourselves from the shadow! Mr. Moka. Thank goodness I managed to get here. We've got to do something. Pee has... Leave us alone. We have a lot to talk about. OK, boss. Cup of coffee? I'd rather have an explanation. Adhara. You can't leave me alone. You're my star. You have to protect me! You were going to be there forever. Tim, what are we going to do now? Moka lied to me. I have to go back. Are you sure? Now I am. Moka knew everything, ever since the beginning. What's that? What is it? Quick! Let's get out of here! It's destroying everything. It's terrible. And the shadow is still growing. It's more dangerous than you can imagine. Once it puts out the last light... it will become complete... and that will be the end of Nocturna! We've got to stop it! Stop it? It's too late. Haven't you realized... that this has to be done by the boy? Maybe you're right, but I have to find him. I promised I wouldn't leave him alone. Where do you think you're going? I won't stay here and do nothing. That's more your way. Good luck, then, my friend. Hey! Big guy! Over here. Murray? You're still lit! Of course. I'm a long-life bulb. Ain't you going to the meeting? I can't. I've got to go and find the boy... and protect him from the shadow. Shadow? Hey, please, you got to take me with you. I've got some unresolved business with that slug. No, my friend. Too dangerous. Believe me, an angry luminous... don't know the meaning of the word "danger." Look! There's Moka's tower. You did it! But how do we get down there? We can't fly. Says who? Did you hear about the stars? What's going on? We can't get any work done without the stars! There aren't even any luminouses. What next? We want an explanation! We want an explanation! Moka is about to arrive, so quiet down. How do you expect us to be quiet? The shadow is destroying everything in Nocturna! Moka must tell us what's happening! Look! As you know, we are living through difficult times... and you want to know who is causing all this. You deserve to know who's responsible... for this devastation, this chaos... this tragedy. You demand to know who sent the shadow... to destroy our night. And I will tell you. The person who caused this is a small boy... named Tim! I can't believe it. Tim! He's a liar. The boy? It can't be. The boy brought the shadow to Nocturna... but he's not responsible for the disaster that confronts us. We must never forget that for some sleepers... this is a place to fear... Nightmares, monsters under the bed... nameless things lurking in dark corners, shadows. This is the night for Tim... and his fear created this monster... which is threatening us... putting an end to all traces of light... To what he most loves. We've got to do something! Yeah! Do something! Do it now! No! There was only one way to defeat the shadow... and only one person could do it. He had to overcome his fear by confronting the shadow... and he had to find this courage by himself. No one could warn him. I tried to make it possible for Tim... to make a journey through Nocturna on his own... but I failed, and I'm sorry. Eclipse! Eclipse! It's eating the moon! Look. It's too late. Tim. Hey. Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure the kid's OK. Hey! Look over there. There's another survivor! It's eating everything. All the stars, the luminouses... and now the moon! Every bit of light. You're the last star... and if you go... Do you think I brought the shadow here? I believe you, Tim. You wouldn't do something like that. You care about us. Cat shepherd! It's Tim! I told you! I knew he'd be OK. Cat shepherd! Cat shepherd! This kid's a survivor like me. It's going towards Tim! Cat shepherd! But... it's me. I hope you got a plan. You'll see. I don't think much of your plan! Nice juicy morsel of light! Not much left! We did it! It's forgotten about the star. Maybe it's time we started worrying about us! Where did he go? OK. Come on. Come on. Come and try me. Come after me! Come on. Don't be shy. What? You chicken or something? Oh, no. Not now! Come on. Don't let me down now. Come on! Hey! Scumbag! Don't you leave! Don't you see what a tasty morsel I am? I'm sorry, big guy. I failed. No time for that now. Listen, we have to hide. We need to find a safe place... somewhere the shadow would never think of looking. There's no such place. Not anymore. Where do you think you're going? It won't be that easy. Tim, you mustn't be afraid. - He needs us! - I can't. Trust me. You have to... face him. You have to do something! You have to... face him. Shepherd! No! Here, monster! Hey! Come on, pick on someone your own size! Cat shepherd... you're gonna be all right! I know you are! I'm sorry. I did nothing to help you. You can still do it. You're the one who must save Nocturna. What? Look at me. I can't do it on my own. I'm afraid. What is there to be afraid of? You've discovered Nocturna. You'd never seen us, but we were always there. You've nothing to fear. Those who love you never leave you. You always carry them with you... even when they're not there. No! Don't leave me! Cat shepherd. Cat shepherd! Cat shepherd... We have to get out of here! What are you doing? Run! There's nowhere to run. Is this what you want? If I'm not afraid, he doesn't exist! North Star? I sure hope this works. Are you OK? I'm... I'm shining! And beautiful! Tim, are you OK? Yes. He's gone. But he'll always be with me. That was some trip. Tobermory! Thanks for helping me, my friends. Look at the sky! We made it! Back to work, boys. OK! What sort of a night have you had, champ? Pretty hectic. That shadow, he kept us busy, but in the end... Yeah, yeah. Good old Murray. You're a real mean guy, right? Now everything is back where it should be. Almost. You belong up there. Thanks for saving me... For saving all of us. It was great being with you. Say hello to Adhara. Thank her for being there night after night. Good-bye! I'll be keeping an eye on you. I know, I know. It's time for bed. You've been a perfect guardian. I'm sure the shepherd would be very proud of you. I'd just like to say thanks to all of you. It's been a long night's work... and we could use a good day's rest. Me, me! Pass it to me! No, no, come on! Shoot it, shoot it! It's not fair! Pass it, pass it!
