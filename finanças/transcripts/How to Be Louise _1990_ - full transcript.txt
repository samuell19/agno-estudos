You know, daddy, there is onething that you could do for me that would really be helpful. Oh god. I'm sorry. It's just a little burned. -I love when toast is burnt. Tell me how I could help you. -Well, I know that Pinky thinks that this, like, getting a husband thing isreally the best route for me. -Well, she just doesn'tunderstand all these modern ideas about expressing yourself. -Well, see it's just-- I don't know. I think I'm having troublebecause I don't really feel confident as a woman, you know? And Gladys told me about thesecorrespondence courses that are supposed to teach youall that kind of stuff.

Lots of milk. -Does she want it on toast? -Oh, excuse me, but generallythe man does the ordering. -Oh. Uh, do-- do you want it on toast? Uh, no toast today. [music playing] -Is everything all right? -Something the matter? -No, but you were just staring off. I-- I thought maybe you bumped your head or something when you fell. -No. No, I don't think so. I fell on my knee. My head wasn't even affected. -Hm. What were you staring at? -Smoking's a really bad habit. -Oh, what, do I smell an ex-smoker here? -It's a filthy habit.

But anyway. Would you mind helping me out with this translation? -Sure. -Uh, the-- the professor, he picked it out for me. -What is this? Is this porn? -No. It's great literature.

Is this yours? -Thank you very much. -You're welcome. -I think I really better get packing. -Yeah. Uh, you know, why don't youcall me when you get back? -OK. -Bye. -Oh, wait. Are you in the phone book? -Yeah. It's a new listing. Fastwalker. Stanley Fastwalker. -OK. He looked so healthy. -Well, he was, darling, but now he's in intensive care. -When can I see him? -Oh, in a few little weeks, honey. The sooner you get it into yourpretty little head that the world doesn't always revolve around you, the happier you're gonna be. Oh, I'd only wish you'd come sooner, OK? -OK, I get the message. Oh Pinky, look. I'm sorry. I think I really just wanna be alone right now. PINKY [OFFSCREEN]: I understand. But first maybe I better tellyou about the will. -The will? PINKY [OFFSCREEN]: Well, things being as they are. Um, but you don't have to worryabout a thing, honey. You are very, very well provided for. And in fact, I took it out ofthe safe to have a tiny peek at it, and it seems that you arethe only one provided for. And naturally, Barbara andEd and I are a little bit confused about this. -Oh, I don't understand. -Well, now the only way that Ican understand it is that it seems it was drawn up 24 yearsago just after your mother's, well, before daddy and I were married. Well, so, obviously there's been no provision at all for me. Not, doesn't that seem a little odd to you, sweetheart? So, what I'm saying is thatBarbara and Ed and I-- well, let's see, how can I put this? Well, we're just gonna lookinto it a little further. I'm sure you can understandthat. -Yes. -Good girl. Now, I'm gonna leave you to soak it a nice, hot tub. -Pinky, what what do you want me to do? -Aren't you a dear? Always thinking of others. Well, you don't have to do a thing, sweetheart. We're talking to someone whoknows about these things. LOUISE [OFFSCREEN]: What,you mean a lawyer? -Well, yes, actually, he is a lawyer. And we're talking severalofficers of the various banks where daddy has his accounts. LOUISE [OFFSCREEN]: Pinky. -Yes, sweetheart? -Is daddy-- Is he dying? -Beulah Louise! Well, of course he isn't-- I love you dearly, honey, but you are so negative. It's just that with financialmatters, you can't procrastinate, honey. Everybody knows that. Now, that is enough about that for tonight. I put clean towels in theblue bathroom for you. They're on the sink rack. LOUISE [OFFSCREEN]: Thank you, Pinky. -That's my girl. -Am I late? -Just like your mother. She loved to make an entrance. -Oh, not that one, darling. that's your uncle Pete's chair. -Here we go. -What happened to the lawn furniture? -Your stepmother is sellingall the furniture. -You see, Beulah, darling, why Ineeded you here immediately? We have to see the lawyertomorrow at 9:00. -Well, what does daddy say about all this? Shouldn't I call him? -Beulah, take my seat, sweetheart. Come on. That's a good girl. -Now, now. We'll get this all squared away. We'll just have dinner andput it out of our mind. LOUISE [OFFSCREEN]: So, what exactly happened? -What do you mean? LOUISE [OFFSCREEN]: When daddy had the attack. -Oh, yes. Uh, well, honey, it was about7:00 in the evening and daddy was sitting there at the table, and I'd just made him a nice, tall drink. -Vodka tonic. PINKY [OFFSCREEN]: Ah huh, with a twist. And he was telling me about hisday, about visiting you, in fact, and then all of a sudden, he just gagged, like this-- [gagging] PINKY [OFFSCREEN]: And that was that. Well, that's all there was to it. I called the doctor, and hecalled the ambulance, and, um, your daddy's in the hospital. -Which hospital? -Oh now, Beulah Louise, honey,I am not even gonna tell you that, because you're just gonna get yourself all worked up. And besides, as soon as wefinish this, I want you to do me a little favor. Would you mind taking a little look at the will? -Tonight? I wanna see daddy. -Well sweetheart, don't youthink you should have a look at it before we meet with a lawyer in the morning? -Why do I have to see a lawyer? What is this about the house? -Well, now he's just gonna talk to you for a couple of minutes. Now Beulah Louise, I know you're gonna be a perfect lady about all of this, aren't you? -Of course. I don't want you to have to sell anymore furniture or anything. -Oh, that's my good girl. Now, Bob, and Pete, and Ed andI are going to have a little teeny talk in here. Now, why don't you just take the paperwork into your room where you're comfy and you canlook it over there, OK? -All right. -And you just remember, youjust trust your Pinky and everything's going to turn out just right. And I promise you, you're gonnabe able to see your daddy within the next couple of weeks. -Couple of weeks? -It would be one thing if wewere dealing with a mature and sane person, but this girl, she's never been completely normal. -It's true. She is a little off. She'll never tell what she's gonna do next. Perhaps she'll decide shedoes want the house. -No Ed, don't worry. She told me she'll do whatever we want her to do. -I still think we're rushing it. I think the whole shebang maycome back and slap us in the face. -Look, I can't afford to have that happen. She has to promise to talk to her dad. -And also that she's withus if he doesn't change it, am I right? [coughing] -Oh, hello Beulah, honey. -Well. I took a look at this-- -Good girl. -And, uh, I think I better sleep on it. So, I'll just say goodnight. -Beulah. Beulah honey! Now, let's not get all excited. Beulah. [buzzing] [buzzing] -Sally? I'm getting out of here. This place is a nightmare. I can't even see my dad. They're having a fight about the will. Yeah. Can you believe it? But look, Sal, um, could you, uh call Mendez? I totally forgot to even tell him I was coming. -Mitchell Fink standing inagainst Robert Williams. -Sweetheart. How are your boys doing, hm? Think it's a little loud for you, don't you, darling? RADIO: Beautiful weather for baseball. -Uh, Max, do you have a minute? I'd like to talk about something. RADIO: And a foul fly-- -I don't think this excitement is good for you, honey. No, Max. I know this is a little awkward, but do you think it's right that I am making mortgagepayments on a home that isn't even in my name? Max. Are you listening to me? Max. Are you listening to me? [screaming] -Well. Just remember what the doctor said. -Oh, yes. And I remember how he kissed meunder the moorish wall, and I thought, well was well him asanother, and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again. Yeah. Um-- Then I asked him with my eyes to ask again. And he asked me would I yes? Say yes, my mountain flower.

LOUISE [OFFSCREEN]: Struggling? -Well, I don't need an answerright now, honey. -Good. -Well, sweetheart, there'sno need to be hysterical. I was just making some casual remarks about hygiene. Now, why don't you go on outabout your business? Who knows? Maybe you'll meet some niceyoung man like Nancy did. And then you'll move away andyou'll start your own life. You won't even need your old daddy and me. -Pinky, how is daddy? I call and you never answer. -There you go again, Beulah Louise, focusing on the negative. -May I please have a simple answer? -Well, of course you can. He's improving. Every day a little better.
