That is important. Especially the latter one, if you overlook it... you should look back into your humanity. Do you copy? Yes, sir! Copy? Yes, sir! Have you ever heard... there was a student beaten up to death here? "1 YEAR LATER" Yes, I have. I heard this young man... had a heart condition but he kept it secret. Until instructor Danai punished him severely. In the end... he died in the tent. Bitch! Is that gonna happen to us? I think no one as mean as instructor Danai. You know well what happened last year. Do you guys know how instructor Danai died? It's rumor that he stepped on a landmine in the woods. Nobody knows why he went there that night. It's so mysterious. Nick. Are you okay? What's wrong?

Oh my god! What do we do? Please let us go. You know, if we helped you back then... we would be dead too. Dead that time or this time... makes no difference. Instructor Danai, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I don't care if you are sorry. You are soldiers. You made mistakes... You have to be responsible. What should we do? For Danai, you don't have to be afraid of him. Ghosts like us, if you are not afraid... we couldn't do you any harm. Naen... Don't be afraid of him. If you aren't afraid, he can't control you. Naen! Naen! Naen! Naen! Please don't die. Naen.

Why didn't you take care of them? They got injured. What kind of instructor are you? You guys too. What you supposed to do? Something went wrong, and you still not realize? Brought you friends out and got injured. All of this squad... You don't pass this year! Come again next year. Get lost! I said get lost! I don't know if this situation with Danai that almost made me and my friends die this time, made us realize what we did wrong at JROTC camp. He is still in here. And never leave again. Waiting the new one, I only know that I feel blessed that we survived here.
