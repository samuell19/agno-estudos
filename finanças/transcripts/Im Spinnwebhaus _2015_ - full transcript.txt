And of the demons! You can drive to Sunvalley. Really. I handle it. What kind of demons are they? You already know it's a secret. I'll beat them this time. I swear I'll be back on Sunday. Here's the list. If somebody is asking... I'm out shopping. Yes. You still owe Nick 5 bucks. Yes, right. He has to take his meds... and Miechen shouldn't draw on the walls. And I don't want you to ride your bike or do anything dangerous. You're the boss now. Just like an adult, okay? Yes. Oah, Nick! Nick.. Hey, eat up! Miechen! I have to wake up Mummy. We're going to the fair today. What?! Awesome! Miechen! She's not coming with us. She'll be back tomorrow. We're going alone. We're going alone. Yeeah! She had to go to Sunvalley. But she didn't say good bye. Of course she did. But you were asleep. How did she say goodbye? Like this. Awesome! Alone. Alright, thats how. Like this. Can't you just wear something else? No Why are those dresses always so complicated? Because they're girls. Okay...Bodymaster! And just through here. Look there Miechen! Look, Jonas! Please Jonas! Hey! Just one each. Piep, piep, piep we all... We'll just handle everything as if Mum was here. Nick, you'll do the laundry and help cleaning up. How many points will I get for that? None. I'll do our homework, do the dishes and go shopping. And you, Miechen, this is really really important. You'll get the mail. Can you do that? Ok. And you will tell no one. None of us. None of us.

I love you! Kisses. I call you again! Bye.. Cool. Booh! Heeeey! Jonas? I didn't see your Mum for a while. Yeah. She is sick in bed. What's wrong with her? She can't breathe properly. Is something wrong with her lungs? Yes exactly. Do you need any help? No. She called our Dad. He's coming over every now and then. Yeah? Alright then... Could you tell your dad... that Marie is wearing those clothes for quite a while now? Yes. She just loves that dress. Sometimes one has to make fathers aware of these things. Can I help you in anyway? No. It's all under control. I'm huuungry. Bye. Bye! Is mommy dead? - Why? You said, that she can't breathe anymore. And there's a soulbird. A what? A soulbird!

Or its your fault, that I'm going to starve And you'll starve too! Well it's your fault that Mummy is gone! What? Yes! You told Miss Dracula everything and that's our punishment. Here. You always forget to take them. I don't need them! As long as nobody is bothering me. You're bothering us. All the time. Just go on! Woah, Nick! Come over here! That's my territory, dwarf! Hey! Hey. Hey dwarf, wait a second. That bottle is worth a lot. You've found it, now you have to take care of it. Did you run away from home? Or did you get kicked out? Ho, he's keeping a secret! But he's still hungry! You think I'm out of my mind? But you are so too, if you run, so jump! The mother of life! The elixir of live! What's an elixir? A magic potion! Cure and toxic, Mother and father, life and death. All in one. Thanks. Hey, hey hey, hey dwarf! Where are you heading? Home. And where is that, huh? Now listen very carefully. There are no laws on the streets... Only those made by the person you are with. So mine! And I'm going to tell you this: I found you, so I have to take care of you. You are responsible for the one, the one you're nurturing. So I'm responsible for you. So I'm responsible for you. So you're going to tell me where you're sleeping tonight. At home. And who is there? At home? My brother and my sister.. And my mother you'll find me. I'm Felix Count of G?tersloh. And if I want to find you, I will. Dwarf. No matter where. Mum? We're doing everything just as you told us to. Miechen planted a tree for you. We love you. Miechen! Suits you well! Thanks! That's bought. Bye Jonas! Ciao. Glad that you've found it! P.E took longer than expected... Well, come in for a second. Sorry for the mess. Miechen. Come! We haven't finished our game yet! Dad's waiting. He's still at our place, cause... mum's sick. But I already told you that, right? Yes. How is she? Yeah, she's got pneumonia. Hm. - You want something to drink? No, we got that at home. Sorry. Sometimes it's messy at our place too. Marie told me some things. You're sleeping in caves, eating trash. There was something else.. You have bugs as pets! Ya, Miechen is such a storyteller Thanks... Jonas, tell your dad to call me, ok? Why? I'll tell to your Dad. Ok. He just wants to know what about... Maybe I could give him some tips about Marie's hair... or where he could buy some cheap bikes. Marie is turning 5. He already bought her a bike... and what Marie told you is all not true! Come on now! But I want to stay here. Come! NOW! Noo... You can keep he: - I don't need her anymore. Please tell your dad, that he should call me. OK, when he has the time. Isn't it nice here?! You've got new clothes your bugs, you can watch TV whenever you want... Isn't that nice? Hold that. I don't know, will that work? That's how Mum did it. But not with hen Right. That's the boys' way. That's the girls' way. Hold tight. I saw Mum today. Where? In the forest behind the kindergarten. You're lying. No! What did she do? She cried. And she asked how I'm doing. And then - then I had to cry as well. And then she cried even more and said that she's going to be back home soon. And then? Then she went to sleep. Where? In the forest. In a cave. Mum? Cat Numilia! Cat Numilia! Did you go there? What did she say? She said - well I said that I'm going to be back in two weeks. Who said that? You or Mum? Me. I'm the Mum myself. Mum? Muuum?? What's wrong, dwarf? Come with me you poor little worm! Now I know where the ones on your neck come from. That's the spiderweb-forest. Beautiful, isn't it? Once they've wrapped you up. They can to take you wherever you want. Oh spider, oh spider, oh bring, oh bring me to the place where I'm not. Where should they transport you to? Just away. Anywhere. Hey, hey, dwarf. Don't you ever feel indifferent about that! OK?! Cause if you don't care... no one will care about you and then you won't even care about yourself and then you're in deep deep shit. And not even the spider could get you out of there anymore. Cause they don't like shit. Cause they're holy. Or that's why they're holy. Who knows. Ask them yourself. Ok. You know where I could get a stove from? What does a dwarf want a stove for? To grow up. I need a stove and two children's bikes. Growing up will ruin you. Takes your breath and lets you die. But I have to. No one has to, if he doesn't want to. I don't even want to. Who wants you? That's a secret. Whoever wants you to grow up, is certainly not grown-up himself or..: Is he not there, respectively she, the mother? I think I can't help you anymore. Hey, let's cut a deal. I get you that stuff and you won't become an adult. But I have to! HEey hey hey, wait! Me Just that you know, where you're heading. Nothing I won't get to school without the bus! You have to! You can't give me orders you're the one who overslept. Jerk! That's what I wished for. Don't touch 'em. I'll ride to the park. But we have to go to school. You're just like Mum. Joooonas! Joooonas! She is losing all of her blood! She isn't reacting. You got her? Thanks, that should be fine. Are you ok? Hey! Wait a second. No. Really it's fine. But I can help you. I can drive you to the hospital. Our mother is coming our way! Our mother is really coming our way! I'll accompany you until then! No. Please just leave us alone! Stay here! Muuuu... Ahhhhhh! We have to get help. No, no help. What?! We have to do this ourselves. Hold her. I'm hungry. I'll get something in a minute. They live from hand to mouth, without electricity or running water I'm hungry. It's broken! Mum! Pssst! Hide! Miss Kreuzer? Hello? Jonas? Marie? You wait. Is anyone home? Hello! Hello! Did you see Mrs Kreuzer? I haven't seen anybody here for a long a time... except for the children. And the father? I don't know.. Did you see them today? No. Jonas? That's just not right. I'm hungry! Mom's writing isn't as neat as that. And she makes that little curl under her S. Are you nuts - This is important! Hey you prick! (crying) Mum! Miechen looks terrible. Mum. That doesn't work. It's all out. Did you put the stones back in? Are you stupid? Hey hey hey, weren't they good enough? Didn't you have fun with them? They bring us misfortune. Take them back. What's with all the sweat? That's none of your business! Do you have a temperature? None of your business! I need medicine! For a wound. I also need the stove. I just wanted to get it. So, stove, medicine - See you in a bit. Felix! Felix! Are you nuts? What are you doing?! Someone's coming! Come on! Here. Take the cash! Leave now! Thanks. Beat it! Jonas! Jonas! Wake up! Hide! Johnny! Nicki! Sweetie! Sabine, please open the door! Dad. Wait here! Sabine! Theres something in your pocket. Dad. Jonny, you're here. Mum told us not to open the door Alright. How is she? A little bit better. Hello? Hello. Hey. Can we eat some ice cream? Hm, I wanted to talk to Sabine. She doesn't want to see you. Hm alright. And where are Nicki and Sweetie? At kindergarten and at school. The kindergartener told me, that Marie wasn't there. Ya. I just brought hen She's doing a bit better And you? I'm alright. Mum? Dad's inviting me to ice cream! Sabine? Alright, let's go. Bye! Byyyye! Bye. Let's go. She's just hanging out there all day. Thanks. Thanks. No worries. Does it taste good? Ya. It's tasty. Johnny. The kindergartener thinks that I'm looking after you guys. Yes, I just told her that, cause Mum didn't make it in time to pick up Miechen. So I did it, but the kindergartener didn't like it. Johnny. Does Sabine really have pneumonia? She got just after we were at your place. And why didn't you call me? I gave you my number, didn't I? We don't want to go to the protectory. Johnny... Why did you move out, when they picked up Nick? That didn't have anything to do with you. He has to take meds, and he is going to a school for retards. Mum told us, that you wanted them to take us all! Alright: Yes. Because of your mother. I thought that would be better for you, so... It doesn't have anything to do with you. You'll understand when you're old enough. What is wrong with your hair? No money for the barber He gave us money. We have quite a lot now! Where's the money? Nick! Where's the money? Nick!! Joni? Where's Nick? He left. What? Where to? I don't know. You don't know?! Why can't you make yourself useful? Maaaann! Nick!! Where's the fucking money?! Shit! Fuck! Why can't I leave you alone, for just one minute. Maaan! Maaan! What's that? What is that?! Cat Numilia. That's what Miechen wanted for her birthday. It's not Miechen's birthday! Yes it is! Jonas. Jonas? Miechen is scared. She's crying for you. We need light. You wait here.. I won't go away anymore. Never again. Felix? Oh spider, oh spider, oh bring, oh bring me there! Thank you. Come over here. Happy Birthday. Mama Miechen. Cat Numilia is making me feel better! She can perform miracles. What does that mean? That you've got pneumonia and that no one knows when you'll be back at school. I don't think that Mum's going to come back. Of course she will. We do exactly as she told us. Why shouldn't she be back? I think she's dead. The tree has routes! There! A demon! Cosy here. A bit messy. Where's your Mum? At Sunvalley. - Gone shopping. Aha. She likes you. Then I'll like her back. When is your Mum going to be back? But I'm the mom. What did you do with that count in the mansion? I just told him everything. What did he do? He didn't understand it and kicked me out. We never got along. That's why I ran away. And you're a real count? I'm a real count. One last question: When did your Mum leave and where did she go? She went shopping, just a little while ago. Come. The fatal thing about lies is: that they will get you and beat you with your own weapons and destroy everything you had. I'm not lying. They will find out one day I'm not lying! And they'll put you I-Don't-Know-Where. I'm not lying!! Or you'll be dead long before that happens What are you taking there? Pills? I'm not lying!!! Hey hey hey! Sch, sch, sch.. Dwarf. Dwarf, what's the Sunvalley? I don't know. For every adventure there are two endings: If you're afraid, it will end badly. But you have courage, it will end well. Sunvalley. Psychiatric Hospital. And their faces became grimaces... They have to leave! The demons are coming! Why do I have to hate them so much? Don't go up there! Never! OK? Never! We don't want you anymore! Did you hear me Mum?! We don't want you anymore! Never ever! I hate you! I hate you more, than you could ever hate us! WE - ARE - NOT - DEMONS! Stupid cow! We're not! Stay there! Forever! Shut up! You're dead! Hey Joni! Joni! The kindergartener was here. She knocked, very often. Very loud. She called for Mum and Dad. And then she said, that she's going to be back with some guy tomorrow. We're burning them all. All of Mum's secrets. Then we'll be free again. Is mommy going to be well now? Yes. And you too? Yes. Everyone. If the spiders get me, I'll go to the Bakatalakaland. What? Where? That's where Cat Numilia is from. There are red birds, you could ride on. And you can fly up up in the air. Over the red mountains and the big seas. There are monkeys and if you stroke them, they bring you good luck. There are monkeys and if you stroke them, they bring you good luck. I'll go to Los Angeles. I can't breathe right. We'll be there. Are you a grown-up now, dwarf? Have courage and everything will be fine. Jonas? Jonas? Can you hear me? Jonas? Hey Joni! Can you hear me? PIEP PIEP, PIEP, we all love each other... Jonas? Hey, Joni! You destroyed our cave. We're going to... We're going to build it again. Just like this one. Promise. OK? Ok? Promise.
