I just found out I was pregnant three days ago. - Oh, well, according to this, You're approaching the end of your first trimester. - Uh... How is that possible? - When was your last period? - Um... Um, a month ago? Two, maybe. - Okay, were you ever on the pill? - Yeah, for years. - Okay, this is super common, Especially among first-time moms. There's nothing to be concerned about. You have a totally healthy baby here. But we will need to adjust your plan of care Since your little bundle of joy will be here in close to six months. And the father, will he be joining us today? - Uh, no, he is away on business. - Okay, got it. Well, if you wanna look at the screen here, You can just make out the little feet. Look at that. Look at all those tiny little toes. (chuckles) (emotional music) You got this. (chuckles) - If I could put 75 on that one. Um, 100 on that one. And then, the rest on that one. - Okay. - Thank you. - These are pamphlets for our free birthing class if you're interested? - Oh. Thank you. - Yeah. - Thanks. (birds chirping) (clears throat) - Oh, hey! - Oh, hi! Is ce not here yet? - Oh, she's running late. It would be like ce to invite me To a yoga class for the first time and then, Just get stuck at work. - Per usual. - Is she ever on time? - I don't know. (chuckles) - Seriously. Oh, hey, I think I found the perfect side hustle for us. - Oh, yeah? - Think it'd be pretty lucrative. - Amazing. What is it? - Well, you're in a... Unique situation. - What do you mean? My baby? (sinister music) - Did you hear about that woman down in royal oak Who was selling positive tests throughout her entire pregnancy? - Selling tests? To who? - All kinds of women. People trying to save their marriages, get a raise, You name it. But this woman in royal oak was thriving. She was making six figures before the baby was even born. - Wow! I mean, it sounds illegal. Or at the very least, wildly unethical. - It's not illegal. Or unethical. - You're not suggesting that I do that, are you? - No! - Oh, okay. - I'm suggesting that we do it. And I can run the business side of things. - Are you serious? - Yeah. - Absolutely not. - Why not? - Well, it just feels, like, wrong. Plus, how would people get the tests? - Word of mouth. And you can find anything online these days. - I mean, have you done something like this before? - Found creative ways to make money on the side? Yeah! - But... Like this? - Selling positive pregnancy tests? Not exactly. But think about it, It's a really easy way for us to make money. You said yourself you're worried about things financially And covering everything, so this is the way to do it. It's literally perfect. - Uh... - I'm just saying. Think about it. (footsteps approaching) - yeah. - Hey! Sorry, sorry. What'd I miss? - Alana was just-- - Talking about baby stuff. - Oh, how exciting! Have you thought about names? I know it's a little bit early, But I think celia is a good contender. (laughs) - cute! (pensive music) (notification chimes) (phone buzzes) (doorbell chimes) - Okay. Oh, this is way out of my budget. (exhales) (notification chimes) (sad music) "stress isn't good for you or the baby. Do everything you can to relax." Oh, I need to relax. (pivotal music) (notification chimes) (phone buzzes) Okay. - So, basically, I would find us all the clients. I already have, like, three women lined up who want the tests. So, as soon as you take these, we're a go. - Seriously? - Seriously. My girlfriend from college, She is ready for her boyfriend to propose. - Hmm. - And they've been together for like, a decade. And I have it on good authority that he has a ring. So, this is just his nudge over the edge. - Right. Feels kinda sketchy. - It's harmless. Her friend is trying to find a way For her and her husband to connect. She doesn't actually want kids, But she thinks that the idea of it, just for a bit, Is exactly what they need to get back on the same page. - Feels like lying. - We'd be helping women take their power back. Giving them the control they deserve over their lives. - Hmm... - Wouldn't you wanna stay in this house, This beautiful house, and raise your baby? (somber music) - I really, really, really do wanna stay in my home. - So, all you have to do is pee on the sticks And I will handle everything else. - Well, I'm not, I'm not saying yes. I-- - you're not saying yes yet. - What happens if we get caught? - Nothing. Nothing about it is illegal. - You're sure? - Sure, sure. - Uh, I don't know. - You're thinking way too hard about this. This is the easiest money you will ever make. Look, I can understand why you'd be feeling morally A bit weird about it all. I do, too. But we're just selling the tests. We're not using them for whatever our clients are using them for. If they wanna do sketchy stuff, that's on them, not us. - All I have to do is take the tests. - That's it. - Okay, let's do it. So, I will take the tests and you will handle the clients. - I love this for us. It's such a good idea. To being absolute boss babes. (bright music) (phone rings) - Jules simmons. - Hi, jules. It's donna calling from dr. Robey's office. - Oh, hi. Is everything okay? - Uh, dr. Robey would like you to come in For some preliminary testing, just to make sure Everything is okay. There's nothing to be concerned about. Can I get you in, In the schedule for tomorrow, for 4 p.M.? - Yeah, that works. - Great.

No, I, I can't accept this. - Why not? You worked for it. - But this is a lot of money. - And there's more where that came from. - Did, did you take-- - take a cut? - Yeah. - Yeah, totally! 70% to you and 30% to me. Just think of me like your talent agent. The face behind the business. But with the majority of the money going to you and the baby. - Oh, this is so weird. - Or it's genius. And we need to milk it for all its worth. Plus, my girlfriend, shavonne, the one that's trying to lock down her fianc√©, She called me today and he's proposing this weekend! It worked! Plus, she referred two more of her friends, so... - Well, thank you. I... I really needed this. - I get that. So do I. - And you did all the heavy lifting!

She was willing to pay a pretty penny for it. $10,000. - Oh, my god. $10,000?! (sighs) no, I... I can't accept that. - We've been through this, jules. You earned it.

Now, you're gonna take the tests And you're gonna pee on them and give them back to me Like we agreed. We had a deal. - Alana-- - do you understand? Because if you don't, I can help you understand. - Are you threatening me? (menacing music) - We're making a lot of money. Now, take the tests and I'll be by later to pick them up. Okay? - Hey, are you all right? - Um... - Let's get outta here. - Okay. - You doing okay? (country music) - Yeah, I'm fine. Really. - Yeah, that was uh, a little intense. - Yeah. - She had mentioned tests. Are those, like, pregnancy tests? - Yeah, it's a decision I regret making. I agreed to sell positive pregnancy tests with her. It was so stupid. I should've shut it down immediately, And now, I'm trying to get out of it, but she... - Yeah, she's not... Taking it very well, I can see. - No. She's not. - That woman, what's her name? - Alana temper. - And how do you know her? - She's a friend of a friend. It was her idea to start selling the tests. - Have you told anyone? - I don't wanna do it anymore. It's wrong. But I feel like I'm in too deep. - I feel like I've heard about this. Yeah, women, using their pregnancies, To take advantage of the system. - No, that, that's not what we're doing. - No, jules, I wouldn't blame you if you were. Jules, you and I both know how hard this is for someone like us. But if you're caught up in something bad or dangerous, You need to go to the police. - I can't go to the police, bridget. - Why not? - Because I would have to explain my role In this whole thing. It would literally ruin my career, my life. - So um... How exactly did this whole thing work? (sighs) - well, she would bring the tests to my house And I would take them. - Making the tests positive. - Exactly. Then she would collect them And sell them to her clients. - Her clients? - Women buying the tests. Women who wanted their boyfriends to propose, Wanted to get back at their boss. I know. - Right. Hmm. - I am not proud of it. Anyway, she would bring me my cut of the payment, And that was that. - Do you even know if any of this is legal? (pensive music) This is all a bit of a mess, isn't it? But hey, there is a solution to every problem, We just might need to do a little bit of digging. - I am so sorry. I should not have shared this with you. - No, no, no, jules. You're fine. - No, but if it's illegal, I've just made you an accomplice. - No, jules, you did not make me an accomplice. - I'm so sorry. My head is just everywhere. I'm... - Okay, it's fine, jules. - I... I'm gonna go. I should go. Bye. - Yeah, no. Of course. Chris, you're not gonna believe this. (lock clicks) (ominous music) - Hello, julia. - How did you get in here? - I was wondering when you'd be back. - How did you get into my house, alana? - Are the tests ready yet? Because I need them. Now. - No. - That's not how this works, jules. We had a deal. - I don't owe you anything. (scoffs) - fine. Then, I'll go to the cops. - I thought you said it wasn't illegal? - I think that they'd be very interested In what I had to say. I'll tell them that... (scared voice): I was forced into it, and it was your idea, And when I wanted out, you got violent! - They'll never believe that. That's not true. - Really? How are you gonna prove that When you're the one that's pregnant? I can't make positive tests. You can. You recruited me. - I didn't. That's not true. - Isn't it, though? You needed the money. (phone beeps) (jules): Okay, let's do it. I will take the tests, you will handle the clients. - It really sounds like it was your idea. Now... Take the test, jules. - Alana... - I said, take the tests. Now. (breathes shakily) (‚ô™‚ô™) (cries softly) (sobbing) (jules sobbing) We don't have time for that, julia. (tense electronic music) Was that so hard? I'll leave the money under your doormat. - I don't want it. (scoffs) - Okay, sure. If I were you, I'd be very careful With who I share this information with. I'm keeping my side of the street clean, So I expect you to do the same. - So, I took the tests and she left. - Holy crap! - I know. It was terrifying. - I've never seen her act like that before. I'm so sorry. - Don't be silly. It's not your fault. How well do you know her? - Well, not very well, But I thought enough to know that she was at least stable, And not some seriously unhinged person. I'll go talk to her. - No, no, it's okay. - No, I introduced you to her. Like, just keep your distance. I'll handle it. I'll just go talk to her. - No, that's a terrible idea. - She can't keep treating you like this. - Well, no, but I... I think we just leave it alone. - Or we can go to the police? - We can't. - Why not? - The recording. It just makes me sound so bad. - So, what do we do? - Nothing. I think we just ride it out And avoid her as long as possible. - And if she threatens you again? Okay, just let me handle it. I've got it, okay? That's that. - Thank you, ce. - Course. - I love you. - Love you. Now, where are we ordering takeout from? Because I'm starving? (laughs) - Me too. (phone rings) (beeps off) (phone rings) (beeps off) (phone rings) (beeps off) (phone rings) Jules simmons. Yes, I would love to come in And speak with you about your design needs. Perfect. Thank you so much. (hopeful music) (menacing music) - Hey, jennifer, can you let lydia know I'll be a few minutes late? I have to make a stop on my way to work. Okay. (gentle classical music) (doorbell chimes) (knocking on door) - Ce! Hi! What a nice surprise! - Leave jules alone. - Excuse me? - I know you're threatening her. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Cut the games, alana. Look, you're fun, and it was great being friends, But I think it's best if you just stay away from jules and me. - Look, I don't know what she's told you, But jules is not-- - leave jules alone, okay? This has to stop. - But ce! - Celia. - Right. (nervous chuckle) Celia, we're still cool, right? - Take care, alana. (keys jingling) (door opening) (ominous music) Hello? (door creaking) (water splashing) (distant thump) (tense music) (door creaking) (water splashing from sink) (music intensifies) (gasps) (keyboard clacking) (phone rings) - Hi! What? No. No, no, no, no, no. (worrying music) (indistinct chatter on speakers) (monitor beeping) (sighs) Hang in there, ce. - Oh, you sure are popular today, celia. - What do you mean? - You're the second young woman here today. The other one just stepped out. Name started with an a. (menacing music) - Alana? - That's it. - Who's alana? - Um... Nurse, Her black eye... - Bruising like that, that's usually consistent With some sort of major impact. But between you and me, The injuries from her fall are on the back of her head, Not the front. - What does that mean? - Oh, god. Drew... - Ce... - She's gonna be okay. (sighs) - Is that... Alana? Alana! - Oh! This is just so sad! You must be drew! I've heard so much about you! So nice to finally meet you! I wish it was under better circumstances. Oh! Poor celia! - How did you even-- - I know you two are such good friends. She would do anything for you. She always has your back. (‚ô™‚ô™) The nurses say that There's a chance she could pull through. Even though it's slim. - It's not just a slim ch-- - anyway, I have to go. Bye, you two. - Okay, what was that? - Can we get out of here? - Yeah, of course. (breathes shakily) um... Our spot? - Yeah. So, it just snowballed from there, and now, Here we are. - Wow, that, that is... - It's a lot, I know. (crying) - Look, I'm sorry. I know you... I know we are under a lot of financial stress, I just thought we had more time to figure things out. - I just didn't wanna make it your problem. - Jules, no. No, no, no. This is not a problem. This is... This is our child. I'm... I'm stoked to be a dad, remember? I just sold a bunch of my vintage action figures online. (scoffs) - what, why? - If that doesn't prove I am 100% committed, I do not know what would. - Thank you. (sighs) - So... So this whole scheme was her idea, yeah? - Yeah. When I tried to back out of it, she uh, got aggressive. - Aggressive, like? - She recorded me and showed up at my birthing class. She broke into my house. - Okay, jules, she sounds dangerous. - Yeah, I think she is dangerous because there's more. (grave music) - Ce's accident. I think alana had something to do with it. - No. - You heard the nurse. Ce's black eye is not consistent with her fall injuries. She went to speak to alana for me, And hours later, she ends up in hospital. - You don't actually think... - It fits. - Okay, um, I'm going to talk to my lawyer friend, peter. Do you remember peter? - Yeah... - Um, I will call him, see what he says to do. Have you told anybody else? - Just my friend, bridget. - Bridget? Who is bridget? - Friend from birthing class. I... I don't know her last name. - But you trust her? - I think so. - Uh, for now, maybe we just keep this between us, Just until I talk to peter. - Okay. - Okay. Let's get you home. (cries) hey. (sighs) - thank you for everything. - Hey, it's what I'm here for. (gentle music) Do you want me to stay the night? Just, just for security. - Right. Um... No, it... I'll be fine. - Um... Okay. Uh, my phone's on if you need anything, And just um, text me before bed. - I will. I promise. (chuckles) - okay. Um... Bye, jules. - Bye, drew. (gate creaks) (gate closes) (phone buzzes) (sentimental music) (ominous music) (gate creaks) (door lock crackling) (door creaks) (jules): Is anyone there? (dramatic boom) (outgoing ringtone) Drew? - Hey. - Hi. Sorry to bother you. - You're never bothering me. What's going on? - Um... Someone tried to break in. - Lock the door and stay inside. I'll be right there. - Mm-hmm. (call beeps off) (breathes shakily) (insects chirping) (footsteps approaching) - Okay, um, there's definitely nobody here. And they didn't take anything? - No, I don't think anyone actually got in. (sighs) - okay. Um... I'll keep an eye out. See if anyone comes back. - Where are you going? - I'll stay in my car. - What? No, no, no. Uh, just... Why don't you just stay inside? On the couch or... - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. - Okay. Uh, get some rest. (sinister music) (small gasp) (engine roars) (indistinct chatter) (worrying music) - You must be jules. - Oh! Hi. - Welcome. - Thank you. Hi. (clears throat) Well, thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to um... - Is everything all right? - Uh, yes. I, I, I just... I'm sorry, I um... Eh... - Jules? (‚ô™‚ô™) - I'm sorry. I have to go. I'm sorry. - Alana? - Can I help you? - Oh. Sorry. Um... Forgive me. (breathes shakily) (sobbing) (outgoing ringtone) (phone rings) - Hey. (jules): I think I'm losing my mind. - You're not losing your mind. - I'm definitely losing my mind! - What's going on? - I just bombed the pitch for the only prospective client I've had Since I got let go, and I confronted this woman I thought was alana and I... The baby and... - Okay, jules, you are under a lot of stress right now. It is totally normal to feel this way. - Have you spoken to peter? - Um, no, but we have been exchanging e-mails. - Do you think he can help? - I am positive. I've known peter for years. Um, he's just really busy right now, but um... No, no, he will be able to handle all this. - I just really can't afford a lawyer right now. - I already talked to peter about that and it's all covered. You know what you need? A chill night. Um... I've still got some work to finish up, But what do you say we do dinner at your place tonight After your birthing class? If you go to the market, I will cook and clean. Just the two of us. How's that sound? - Like a dream. - Okay, um... I will text you when I'm heading over. (sighs) - okay. (tense music) (indistinct chatter) - Hey, are you okay? - Yeah. I don't know. Just having a rough day. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Yeah. For starters, I bombed that pitch meeting. - Oh no. What happened? - I thought I saw alana. It wasn't her, but I could've sworn it was her. And last night, someone tried to break into my house. - What? - The front door was ajar. So, I called drew. - Wait, your ex, drew? - Mm. So, he came over and-- - oh. - Oh, just to check if everything was safe. - Are you guys back? - No, no, we're just friends. - Okay. - Yeah. - But if he asks you to take him back, right here, right now, What would you say? You would, wouldn't you? - I would consider it, yeah. - Right. Um... How did you say you knew alana again? Was it a friend of a friend? - Yeah. Anyway, I don't wanna talk about that anymore. - Yeah, yeah, of course. - How are you? How was your week? - Yeah, good! (instructor): Welcome, everybody. If I can have everyone's attention so we can get this class started. (crickets chirping) (ominous music) (worried breaths) (keys jingling) - Stop! Get away! - Whoa, whoa, it's just me. - What do you want? - Calm down! What is going on with you? - What are you doing here? - I'm just here to give you your money. You've been ignoring me, so I figured I'd just come by and drop it off. - Why are you having me followed? - What? - I know you know what I'm talking about, alana. - I really don't. - I'm not playing your games. - I'm not playing any games! I'm just here to give you your money. That's it. I was going to leave it under the mat, Like I said I would, but I saw you walking up, So I thought I'd give it to you in person. - Um, I told you, I don't want it. - You and I both know you need it. Look, I don't know what's going on with you, But you need to calm down and take the money. For the sake of your baby. (‚ô™‚ô™) See you later. (sighs) (drew): Hey! What are you doing here? What is she... What is she... Uh... Um, are you okay? (breathes shakily) what... Jules? - Okay... - Let's get you inside. - Yeah... (door clicking) - come on. (clears throat) - Are you sure I can't help with anything? (chuckles) - You, mother of my child, Who has had a wild day, can sit and relax. How's your tea? - It's perfect. Thank you. - So, the man you saw. - Hmm. Yeah, I think he's been following me. Actually, I take that back. I know he's been following me. - And you're sure alana sent him? - Well, I mean, why else would he be following me? - But alana said she didn't know anything about him. - But she must be lying. - Why would she do that? I'm just trying to understand the situation. That's all. - I don't know. To... Scare me or maybe keep doing the tests? I mean, first ce's accident, and now this? It's very suspicious. - How much was the last one for? - I stopped counting at $10,000. (pensive music) - $10,000? - I know. It's insane. - Look, I, I'm sorry you felt like you had to do that. You don't have to anymore. You don't owe her anything. - Drew, I mean, with your book, the baby's-- - It's all taken care of. I applied for a loan. It'll be squared away before the baby comes, But it'll buy me some more time with the book. We are in this together. For better or for worse. (chuckles under breath) - okay. (laughs) - I, I had a nice time. - So did I. And thank you for cooking and cleaning. - Thank you for the groceries. (deep exhale) Oh, and sleep tight, little one. I cannot wait to meet you. (kisses and chuckles) Uh, my phone is on me if you have any issues. - I will call. - Promise? - Yes, I promise. (phone buzzes) - Okay, um... Good night. - Good night. (gentle music) Hey. (gate creaks) (doorbell chimes) - Coming! Hello? (curious music) (keyboard clacking) That's bridget. What's going on? Journalist? (phone buzzes) - what? Bridget. (exhales) (suspenseful music) (velcro scratching) (dramatic boom) - Okay, that... That is very unsettling. Why? Why, why would she lie about who she is? - I don't know. - Okay. Um... (phone rings) But you're sure? - Yeah, this person told me her name was bridget, not maureen. - Okay, I don't think you should go back there anymore. - Where? - The birthing class. - Drew... - No, jules, I am serious. - No, I'm going. I have to find out who this woman is And what she wants from me. She could be working with alana. - She might be dangerous. (phone rings) (sighs) - who's... Who's kristen, And why does she keep calling you? - She's... She's a woman. (scoffs) - obviously. Why are you keeping her a secret from me? - She's not a secret, she's just... I met her at a party a few weeks ago and... Things got a little hot and heavy, And one thing led to another, and... - So, she was a one-night stand or...? - Yeah. That's... That's sort of grown into something more. (sentimental music) - Oh, so you're seeing her. - No, not officially. Um... But yeah. - And you like her? Drew, that's... - Jules, I care about you. A lot. And... I feel a sense of loyalty towards you, obviously. Um... That is why I'm here. I always wanna be here, Whenever you need. - But you... Don't have feelings like that for me. - Do you still have feelings for me? - I mean... Of course. I really enjoy spending time with you. - But when you think of your life, The person you wanna do everything with, is... Is that me? - No, it's not. But kristen? - I don't know. I mean... (chuckles) Maybe she could be. She's, she's giving this presentation on conservation tips. She's an environmentalist and um, She invited me to go, but then... - Drew, you have to go. Why didn't you tell me? Look, I don't want her getting The wrong idea about what's going on between us. I care about you a ton. As a friend. - I... I care about you so much as a friend, too. - Then, you should go. Right now, or I'll be mad at you. - You sure? - Yes, positive. - Okay, just... Just promise me you'll at least consider Skipping the birthing class this week? - I'll consider it. Go. - Okay, uh... (indistinct chatter) (instructor): Okay, welcome everybody. I'm sure we're getting very excited Now that we're getting closer to the due dates. I know a couple of you guys had questions about What to bring to the hospital. And I wanna get into detail about what's in those bags A little bit later. But essentially, you're gonna bring three bags, One for you, one for your partner, And of course, one for your baby. (tense music) All right, thanks so much, guys, for a great class! I'll see you next week! (jules): Hey! Why are you pretending to be someone else? - Jules, what is going on? Are you all right? - Someone called bridget? - Okay, jules, just slow down. - I know that's not your real name. Tell me what you're really doing here. - Okay, okay, I'll tell you everything, But not right now. Can you please Just keep your voice down? - No! - Jules, please! - Did you steal this woman's identity? - No! - Then tell me what you're doing here! Why you're lying about who you are. (whispers): This stays between us, okay? There's a lot on the line here. My name's maureen quinn. I'm a journalist with the daily gazette And I'm writing a story about Pregnancy schemes across the country. - How did you find me? It's a pretty crazy coincidence You show up at a birthing class with this going on? - These schemes are a lot more common than you think. This is the fourth one that I've encountered. - Really? - I've been to dozens of classes across the country. I'm interviewing people as covertly as I can. I read an article about a woman, Same one it seems your friend alana read about. The one who gave her the idea about selling the positive tests. I had to look into this for myself. Understand why. Why would somebody get caught up in something like this? - But why this birthing class? - Because it's free And it serves everyone. I had a tip from an online message board And I knew to look for women who were in the class Without a partner, Because they were the ones that were most likely To get wrapped up in some kind of a scheme. - So, you sitting next to me that first day... - Wasn't an accident, no. - You used me. - No, this story was in the works Well before we met, but... At first, yes. Jules, this story's really important to me. This could make my career as a journalist, Exposing something like this. - But what about me? You're exposing me! - I am not using your real name. - But this story is about me. - No, it's not, totally. - A little bit though, yes? - I will protect your identity, jules, I promise! - Why should I believe you? - I have no reason to lie to you. - You have lied to me this entire time. (pensive music) - You're right. Listen, I'm still in the research phase, But alana temper is a really interesting angle. I have never seen somebody outside the pregnancy community Initiate a scheme like this. I don't normally do this, But I would be happy to show you my files, And that way, you know I am telling you the truth. I've looked into multiple people and everything I've found on alana is... Well, it's not great, at best. I'm not saying that she's dangerous, But there are things in her past that you need to see. - Like what? - I'll tell you everything. You give me one hour And I'll meet you at the coffee shop. - Everything? - Everything. There are things in these files that you need to see. This isn't the first time alana's done something like this. She's known for her get-rich-quick schemes. And from what I found, her last one involved cryptocurrency. (tense music) - Okay, fine. One hour, at the coffee shop. - Okay. I'll see you there. (crickets chirping) (ominous music) (gasps) - Get in the house! Get in the house! (screams) (door slams) (sobbing): Please! Please! Please! (screams) - stop screaming. (muffled scream) - stop! I'll remove my hand If you promise to stop screaming, okay? - Mm-hmm! (screams) - stop! I said stop screaming. Please, I just wanna talk. I don't wanna hurt you. I just wanna talk, okay? (sobbing) Do you promise? - Mm-hmm. (panting) - There has to be a way to fix this. You have to fix this! - Fix what? Fix what? - Do you realize what you did?! - I don't know what you're talking about! (panting) - Hey! Hey! Get back here! You're not going anywhere. (screams) Not until you fix this. You ruined my life, do you know that? It was a one-night stand. It wasn't supposed to mean anything! But then, sheila came back with one of your tests. It was positive. She claimed to be pregnant. Started making all sorts of demands, mostly money. So much money! (scared exhale) and then, my wife megan found out. Yeah. She didn't take it real well. Took the kids and left. She went to my office. Told everyone there what I did And what kind of man she thought I was. I lost my job, my home, and my family. All because of you. Sheila even admitted it came from a friend of a friend. Alana. So, I started keeping an eye on alana. Biding my time. But when I saw her come here, To your house and I saw you and your belly, I knew you were the person to blame. (threatening music) I have nothing left. - I am so sorry. I should never have agreed to take the tests. Never agreed to sell them. I'm... I should have shut it down earlier. - Why didn't you? - Alana, she was... She was blackmailing me. She was threatening me. But I'm not afraid of her anymore. I will go to the police and turn myself and alana in. - You will? - Yes. It's the right thing to do. - When? - Now. Now, I will, I will meet you there. (tense electronic music) - Uh... Okay. (door closes) (heavy breathing) (footsteps approaching) (decisive music) (outgoing ringtone) - Hey, it's drew, how's it going? (sighs) wait, you called me. Leave a message. - Drew, it's me. Um... I'm going to the police station to... To tell them everything, And it's a long story, but um... Can you please meet me there? Please? (sighs): Oh, where are you? (deep exhale) (tense music) Oh, god! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, wake up! Wake up! Can you hear me? Hey! - You're not going to the cops, jules. (grunts) - no! (stressful music) (panting) (bat rattles) (outgoing ringtone) (phone buzzes) (maureen): Jules? Where are you? (grunts) (alana): Give me the phone. Give me the phone! (phone clatters) - Please! Please! Please think of the baby! Please! Think of the baby, please! Please! - Jules! Jules! Shoot! (dramatic music) Uh, police! I need to talk to the police! It's an emergency! (panting) - alana, please, can we talk about this? (snorts) - I think we're a little bit past that. Don't you? I even warned you about bridget, with the envelope. - Why are you doing this? - You have no idea how lucky you are. How privileged. You have never had everything you've ever worked for Ripped out from under you! (scoffs) He destroyed my life. I married him. Gave him access to everything. And he gambled it... All away. Under my name! Just bad bet after bad bet. Real deadbeat. But then, that night, at celia's, I thought I found a kindred spirit in you. I thought that we were gonna be single girls together. Rebuild ourselves together. Without those men dragging us down. (sniffles) And then, we found out that you were pregnant and you needed money. (laughs): And I realized... This is it! I could take advantage of it-- We... Could take advantage of this situation. And... I could make... All my money back. And it's working, jules! It's working! (laughs) We are building something special here. Something... Lucrative. And we're not stopping. Not now. (grave music) - Alana, please. You don't have to do all this. There... There are other ways. I talked to drew. He's gonna talk to his lawyer friend tonight. (chuckles) - Oh, uh... You didn't hear About the... Father of your baby? He was involved in a hit-and-run. (singsong): He's in the hospital. (snorts) (music intensifies) - No! (screams) Why?! (alana laughs) Why would you do that?! (gasps) - Celia, you did that too, didn't you? (choking and coughing) (panicked breaths) (dramatic music) (screams) (pants) (relieved sigh) (distant police sirens wailing) (grunts) (birds chirping) Yes, I will have the draft design to you this afternoon. No, thank you, ann-marie. I'm really excited to be working with you. (baby crying on monitor) Okay. Drew? - Yep? - Baby's up. (uplifting music) - One step ahead of you. - Hmm? - Say good morning.
