Hey, here's the bus! Here, hold this, Eva. Go away, you kids! Let them pass. Go away! I'll take care of them. Go, go, go, come on! - Are you Professor Ibañez? - Yes I am. - We've been waiting for you since this morning, Professor. I hope you will enjoy your stay in São Sebastião. Thank you. Please, Professor, right this way. Go to mass! That's enough, go away! Ah. Bom dia, and welcome to our modest hotel. You're Professor Ibañez? Yes I am, good afternoon. Oh, Professor, I'm very sorry but I'm afraid we don't have two single rooms available. How is that? Didn't you receive the letter I sent? But surely you knew we were arriving today. Why sure he knew. Well, of course, you're right but last night a couple of Americans arrived unexpectedly and well, I couldn't let them stay on the sidewalk. But I worked out an arrangement that I'm sure you will find satisfactory. I had another bed moved into your room. That way the young lady could stay with you. I'm happy with that arrangement. He's my father. Oh well, of course, I- - Well, since that's the only room you have, and there's no other hotel, we'll take it. You're very kind, Professor. You know, your room's the nicest one we have. I'm sure it's lovely. In my letter reserving the rooms, I also asked you to reserve two seats for us on the plane back to Manaus. I hope you're not going to tell me the plane's full as well. - Oh, the plane will have other passengers, of course. But the pilot assured me that you'll have two seats. They're confirmed, don't worry. Mizana, take their bags up to their room. Si, señor. At least it's not so hot today. - Ah, there you are, did you call the car for us? It's waiting outside for you. Hmm. Come on, girls, we've got a lot of work to do this afternoon. He's a photographer from São Paulo and the two girls are models. They came down here on a photo assignment. He says he worked for a fashion magazine. If you ask me, I bet it's a sex one. Hey, gringo! Huh? We're in São Sebastião. A lousy trip and worse food, here. - Hey, the bananas weren't included in the price! Sorry, tried to pay. But the waiter couldn't change my hundred dollar bill. - Bet that gringo doesn't have a dollar on him. He's worse off than us. Come on, help me upload my baggage. For five dollars, you sure want a lot. You got my last five bucks, I'm broke. - Just my luck, I found the first poor American. Well, get off! Okay, calm down, be careful, huh? Yeah. - Be careful, I worked a year for what's in there, easy! I've seen all kinds of work, but someone who collects old bones? - They're not just old, they're prehistoric. What can I do for you, stranger? And what's in that crate? Well, whatever it is, we don't want any. I just want a room. Eh, I'm sorry but right now we don't have a room. We're full up. You sure? Look, I'm not fussy. I'll sleep in any old room you got in the house. No, no, no, there's nothing. - I can pay with my credit card, American Express. Well. Okay, now move around some more. Belinda, turn. Move to the right. That's fine, now keep moving around. Okay, now go and change. Ancl make it snappy, huh? Yes, Robby, we will. Carlito, we've got to change but you promise not to look. You're not peeking, are you? Pretty good fight, eh? - You've been staring at that man all night. At least he looks like a live one and not burnt out like you, Captain Heinz. I should say, ex-captain. My ex-lover and ex-husband. Yeah, that's you! Come on, stop pouring that stuff. You're bummed out now. So? Ancl what can you offer me tonight that'll help me to sleep? When you've got enough strength in you to finally make it in bed, let me know. He's the champion! He's the winner! My God, we won! Fantastic! I tell you, he's terrific! A thousand cruzeiros I won! Bonsoir, madame. Bonsoir, monsieur. - Bonsoir, pilot, but why don't you sit down? - I have to speak with you alone for a moment. It's a confidential matter. It's a little too noisy right here. I'll be right back. All right, what's the big mystery about? What do you have to tell me? Well, as I told you before, there'll be other passengers on our flight tomorrow to Manaus. One of them is a professor who has asked me to make a little side trip. Naturally, he'll pay the extra charges. He wants to visit the Valley of the Dinosaurs. The Valley of the Dinosaurs? Oh yes, I've heard of it. Lower your voice. Why, is it a secret? No, but one is not allowed to visit it. It's a reservation for the Aquara Indians. I could lose my license. - Well, okay, but what's so great about it? - It's filled with fossils and the tracks of dinosaurs that lived millions of years ago. To me it sounds great. My wife will be no problem and the other passengers get a free ride. Have some of mine. Merci. I'm American, you French? Oui. If you can guess what I do, I'll buy you a whole case of that. Well, I'm afraid you lost. You're a bone hunter. Well how would you know that? Monsieur, news travels fast around here. You arrived this morning and you're waiting for the boat to Manaus. - That's right but I've changed my mind about the boat. Well, I'll give you the address where you can send that case of Cachaça. If you don't mind, I prefer to drink alone. Well, I already know where to send it. The air service office. Oh? Since you know where, you can leave me alone. - Listen, I study the bones of prehistoric animals and since you're flying to the Valley of the Dinosaurs tomorrow, I'd like to fly there with you. No, monsieur, no way. Yeah, imagined you'd say that because it's not on your regular route and it's off limits to visitors since it's part of the Aquara Indian reservation. But you're gonna land there anyway. You know, suddenly I'm in a big hurry to get to Manaus. You wouldn't have a seat on the plane for me? No, all the seats are filled. How unfortunate. What I mean is, how unfortunate for the air service. Wait a moment. Second thoughts? Well, you can come along but don't bring any baggage. It's okay, I'll send it by boat. Then talk to Professor Ibañez. If he agrees to have you, you'll go. Ibañez? Pedro Ibañez? Mm-hmm? - No! - What? For the last time, Carlito, I say no! We've been walking for five hours because of you! I'm not giving you another- - But senor, it's not my fault the tires went flat! Well it's certainly not mine! If you had decent tires on that heap, it wouldn't have happened! I'm not paying you any more! Hey! Look at her. - But what about my time and all the gas I used? Huh? What're you talking about? - But it's not fair! - You spend more time watching the girls! - You owe me for the whole clay! - I'm the one who's losing money here! Mwuah. Chingar! Hey, cut that out, you! What the hell, you son of a bitch? Stay out of this, I'll show you! Gringo, that's my brother you hit. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt him. - Yeah. - I would never have imagined he'd have a brother as big as. He's also my brother. - Well judging by the difference between all of you, your mother must've been mighty busy. You like my brothers? - I'd like them better if they were a little smaller. Look, they're gonna put you to sleep now. The American's courageous all right. But why would man want to fight monsters like that for? Did I wake you up? Wake me? With my pains? I'm sorry. I didn't have a chance to thank you before. Forget it, it was a pleasure. It was a good workout but I'm out of shape. I'm afraid I can't move. Just lie there and relax. You don't have to move for me. Do I bother you? No way, honey, could you bother me. Well, I only wanted to thank you my way. What a great idea you had. Anybody home? Is that you, father? Would you bring me my bathrobe? Hey, did you hear me? Bring me my bath robe, please. But who are you? You're not my father! And you're not Professor Ibañez. I'm Professor Ibañez, and you better explain what you're doing in my room. My name's Hall. I'm Kevin, Kevin Hall. I'm with the Boston Institute of Paleontology. I'm pleased to meet you, Professor. I've read all your books. "Dynamics of Evolution," "Paleozoic Epistemology," and "On the Trail of the Last Dinosaurs." Ah, you missed one, young man. But don't worry about it, it's only just been published. Now what can I do for you, Kevin Hall? I want a seat on the plane. I want to go to the Valley of the Dinosaurs. No, I'm sorry, the plane is full. Professor, I can sit in the aisle. You'll have to ask the pilot. I've already clone that. He says it's up to you. Aren't you afraid? That place is supposed to be cursed. Not if you aren't, Professor. - If it depended on me, Father, I'd refuse him. But, Eva, my clear, how can I possibly refuse the one person in this whole world who's read all my books? This is my daughter. We've already met, informally. Oh, don't try being familiar with me just because you saw me naked in my shower. Voyeur. - We should land in the Valley of the Dinosaurs in about 40 minutes. Down there, the Indians are still living in their primitive state. That's the land of the Aquara. They're also head hunters, they still practice it. But what's more, some of them are cannibals besides. But I hear the God they venerate is some kind of animal. Fortunately, they seldom frequent the zone where we're going. Yes, the Aquaras are still an unknown entity even today because from that green hell, very few white men have come out alive. - Well I lived in the jungle for more than three years. Yeah, in Vietnam, tell them about it. You just loved that filthy war. He was a big hero, that's all he ever talks about. Want a banana? No, I'm not hungry. Hey, pilot, what's the matter? Can't you keep this plane on level flight? - I advise you to return to your seat right away. We're on rough air. Your standing around could cause use to roll even more. Now get back there and leave me alone! This is my job! We've arrived! That's the place where we're going. Oh, it's beautiful! But Professor, I heard in São Sebastião that there's a curse on anyone who goes into that valley. You already know senorita Monica? - Yeah, I know her, only I didn't know her name. Mr. Hall makes friends easily. I try to. You gotta go back to your seat. - I bet the curse of the Valley of the Dinosaurs is doing it. That's what it is. Yeah, I'll drink to it. You're stupid. Oh! Hold on, hold on! - We're going to crash, I know it! Shut up! - It's the valley's curse, I told you. What's the matter with the plane? God only knows. The controls aren't responding. All this bouncing around must've damaged a relay. I've never seen such turbulence as this before. There's trouble in the port motor. Oh God! I don't wanna die! We should never have flown in here. I'm afraid we're going to crash. You gonna try to land? - I hope we can find a clearing in that forest. The plane stopped. It stopped. Monica! Oh my God! Oh God, where are we? Oh, Papa! Papa! Oh, somebody help him! He needs help. Oh no. - I'm gonna kill that moronic son of a bitch! He's dead. No! We're all gonna be killed! We're all gonna die here! We're all gonna die! - Calm here down, will you? - We're gonna be killed! Go and order somebody else around, will you? - The headhunters will get us! We're all gonna die! We're all gonna die! - To hell with you. I don't wanna die. Don't let me die, John! Shut your mouth, woman! Shut up! He's badly hurt. We've got to get him to a hospital. No way. We're in the middle of the jungle and the radio's broken. - Oh my God. - And the condition he's in right now, we can't move him. Help will reach us soon though, surely. No, we were flying way off course. They'll be searching for us somewhere around Manaus. They won't be looking down here, you can bet on it. What're you saying, they can't find us? They won't search here? The flight plan was for Manaus. Soon as they realize we're overdue, they'll search the route we were supposed to have taken for Manaus. In three clays they'll draw a blank, they'll give it up and there's no reason for them to come searching around here. - So we're just gonna have to make it by ourselves. - Papa. - Which won't be easy. This place is inhabited by Aquara Indians. I'll get us out, don't worry. Hell, I did three tours in Nam. Ancl if I got out of there alive, a couple of Indians ain't gonna stop me here. You mean we're gonna be all right? Everybody's gonna be all right as long as they obey my orders! This isn't Vietnam. This is the Amazon jungle. So right, Indians instead of gooks. The survival training we Green Berets had is good for anywhere. Jungles don't change that much, you know, and they're not that difficult if you're specialist trained. I'll go with you. Same here. Papa. - All right, as of now I'm in command here. We're leaving at once! Just before we crashed I saw a river, that's where we'll make for. It should take us more or less in the right direction. Let's move out, come on. I can't just walk away and leave Papa. So stay here. You don't have to come. No one's obliged to come. We'll stay here. There's no reason to now. The Professor just died. Papa! Eva. Come on. There's nothing more we can do. Oh shit! That's all I needed, the heel's broken. Give it here. Right, give me the other one. Enjoying the view, Johnny boy? There you go. Now they're lower, they should be easier to walk in. All right, let's move! Watch your head, Betty. Come on, close up! Up you go. Come on now, Eva. We've gotta keep going. Then you go ahead, leave me here. I'm not leaving you. Come on, give me your arm. I'll help you. Come on, it's only a leech! Did you hear me? Come on, I wanna get to the river while it's still light. Or do you need a rest, Kevin? Let's move it. Now that's dead reckoning, General. Couldn't have landed us any deeper in the shit if you had a map reference. One advantage we have being here, we know where they are so we can avoid them. Yeah, hope you're right. It won't make much difference if I'm not. You gonna stand around and wait for them to kill you here? Come on, move it! Look at him playing the great hero. If they only knew the truth! Hold it! Quiet! Down, get down! No, don't make a sound or we'll all die! We better wait. I'm not gonna try to pull them off now because the tears could go septic and you might get gangrene. You'll have to put up with them for a little while yet. - Let's keep moving, I wanna get out of this hunting ground before it's dark. You're not the only one, don't worry. Let's go. We'll stop again when we're in better cover. I can't go any further, please! All right, we stop here. It hurts, John, it hurts. 10 minutes then we move on. Oh God, can't you hurry? Get these things off me. Take it easy. Rob, collect some dry twigs and bring them here. It won't be long now. Come on, Robby, what're you waiting for? Move your ass! For Christ sake, what're you taking your cameras for? You've got a long way to go yet. Why shouldn't I? Doesn't bother me any. Well it bothers me. It's heavy and it slows you down and that means it slows everybody down. What're you doing? You bastard! You rotten bastard! Listen! I've heard that chanting before. It's when the hunters get back home. It's their way of thanking the spirits. Where the hell did you learn so much about these bloodthirsty bastards? You shack up with one? - No, not exactly, but I have spent a lot of time among other tribes. Listen, maybe we should forget the river and go a different way. I can't see us getting past the Aquara. Whether you see it or not, we have to. The river's the only possibility we have of getting out of here in one piece. He's right. I hate to admit it but he's right. Oh please, John. Get these things off my arm. - All right, come on now. All right. That's it. - I still think that we should've waited for help back there where we crashed. It would've been much safer. - Safer maybe, but help would never have arrived. We went through this before, Eva. The flight plan was for Manaus. We're a hundred miles off that route. You wanna live? You better eat whatever there is to eat. The drums have stopped. They heard her. You stupid little cow! Now we're gonna have every Aquara in the territory down our backs! You could've signed our death warrants panicking like that! They won't hunt this late in the clay. They're afraid of the bad spirits at night. They'll start looking for us in the morning though and they'll find these tracks and follow them. The faster and further we move tonight, the better our chances. We've gotta find the river. Come on, let's go! Water! Water! Take it easy! Don't drink too much in one gulp! - Is the jungle giving you illusions of manhood, Johnny boy? You're just like a dog chasing a car. If you did catch it, the best you could do is smell it and run. Five minutes. Then we'll follow the stream. It may bring us to the river. And let's hope Kevin's theory about the Aquara not starting to look for us until tomorrow is true. It could be them. It could be the Aquara. Bastards! They're surrounding us. Let's get the hell out of here, come on! I'm the one in command. - Then give the order to move before it's too late. Ha. That's an animal that's making that noise. Yeah, in Vietnam maybe. But that's the Aquara, I was wrong the first time. I don't give a shit what you were, just shut your mouth and follow orders. You're a bloody fool. You can take your orders and shove them! You pull that knife and you're history. Do it now, kill him! Go on, shoot! All right, let's move out. What's wrong? Piranha! Quick, get out of the water! - Oh my God! Get out! Come on, get out! Here! Oh God, no! Help me, please! Please, for God sakes, help me! Please do something! You stinking murderer! - He didn't have a hope and he was making enough noise to bring the whole Amazon basin down on us! Kevin! John, look out! Look out! Eva! Eva, you can't stop now! It's too dangerous! I can't go, leave me alone. No, come on, I'll help you! No, don't stop now, come on! Make an effort, please, come on! John, help me! Jesus, quicksand! John, help me! John! Keep still. Don't move, Betty! John! Quickly! Oh God, I don't wanna die! John, don't go, help! Help me! No, John, no! Help me! Christ! You yellow bastard! Where you hiding, gooks? Come on out, come out! Goddamn gooks! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Come on, get down from there! Let's go! Hurry! Over there! Come on, keep going! There's the boat! Quick, get in! Keep low. We're all right. It's all over now. Kevin, look! Oh shit! - We haven't seen a sign of them for hours now, Kevin. Do you think it's possible they're still following us? - Yeah, I'm sure they're just staying out of sight and watching us, waiting for the right moment. Something tells me the Aquara are still around here. The biggest problem is ammunition. Only three shells left. Keep your eyes open. Shit, they got us! Kevin, they've given up. They're leaving. I know! That was the chief I just shot, that's why. Out you go, we'll take a rest here. - Say, do you think we'll ever get out of here alive, Kevin? Yes, do we have a chance, Kevin? I really don't know. No sense dragging this around. I'm gonna get us something to eat. Kevin, wait, I'll come with you. Kevin! Wait! It got away. You know, I'm beginning to fall in love. Stop it! Not another word or I'll end up believing you. My God, look at that! What is it? It's a dinosaur's footprint. It's fossilized. That's why it's so well preserved. That's prehistory right there! There's another one over there. They're incredible. This whole area must've been crawling with them at one time. It's too bad we can't stick around and make a real search. Oh look, there's another one. They're so big! How heavy would a dinosaur have been? Gee, between 30 and 35 tons. And why did they simply die out? - It's believed the ice age did them in. Help us. Please, help us. - Don't worry about them, they're just slaves. They run away occasionally. Now then, what would a couple of youngsters like you be doing around here? Where have you come from? The Valley of the Dinosaurs. We stole a canoe from the Aquara and came down river. - You're either the biggest liar in the sun or very lucky indeed. I've never heard of anyone getting away from the Aquara. But let's suppose it's true, all right? Then tell me, how did you get there in the first place? - You put that gun down, I might just do that. You got a deal. All right. Well? Our plane crashed in the valley there. We're the survivors. Can you help us back to a civilized place? - Civilization's just an hour's walk from here, that's all. A little oasis. You're both welcome to stay there. Thanks. Who's the pretty lady? She's a friend. An intimate friend, huh? Fatty, that's my business. Hey, China, look what I found! China's here! Hey, China, I see you found more than you went looking for! Yep, we've got guests. - And very pretty ones too, I must say. - Welcome to the Green Hell Hilton. - Yeah, those are the kind of guests I like. Everything all right, Blackie? - Yeah boss, everything's just fine. - All right, put the prisoners in the cage. Come on. - A couple of clays in there without food and water, that'll teach 'em. Up she goes! They won't try to escape again. Now then, I want you to feel like you're in your own home. You're amongst friends here. First, the girls need clothes. Clothes? But, uh... Well, I... I rather like the way they are dressed. - I'm beginning to regret we met this morning. - But it's only a question of compromising a little. You have to understand and see things from my point-of-view. Life out here in the jungle can get very monotonous and very boring. So, naturally, when an occasion like this presents itself, we take full advantage of it. - Well we won't be here long enough to get bored. You'd never make it out alive. Listen, conditions will be much easier in a few weeks when it's dry. You enjoy yourselves here. Relax, don't worry. I'm sure we can find all kinds of ways of passing the time pleasantly together. And, of course, there are my men. They have a hard life working in a mine all clay and they deserve an occasional reward, don't you agree? What're you mining? Just a few precious stones. Kevin! Hands off, Myara, she's for me, not you. All right, come on! Move your asses! Everybody out! Move it! Come on, take cover! On the double! Move it! Ready? Okay, go! Kevin! Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. You're just wasting your energy. The only way you'll get free is if I let you go. You know what you are? You're a fat, smelly, evil bastard! I guess you're thirsty. Here, have a drink. If you don't, you'll regret it later. You behave yourself, I may just put you to work in a mine. Otherwise, I'll leave you tied up here for the pigs to eat. You son of a bitch! I must say, the girls are very pretty. I'm sure they'll accept the situation eventually. How long you gonna make us stay? - You coming here has created quite a problem, I'm afraid. If news were to get out that I'm mining successfully in this area, they'd overrun us in a month. So, you see, I can't just let you walk out of here. At least let the girls go. - If I did that, my assistants would probably kill me. That wouldn't go down well at all. Besides, they wouldn't last long alone in the jungle and I'd prefer to keep them around for our pleasure. As you so rightly said, I am a son of a bitch! You watch your mouth. Call me a son of a bitch again, you're dead. You hear me? Hi, honey. I bet you have no idea what the boss has in store for you tonight, sweetheart. You can't imagine the wonderful things he's gonna do to your body. Then tomorrow or the next clay, when he's sick of you, you'll be common property for the entire camp and they'll screw your ass right into the ground. And that's only the beginning. Because then yours truly will get to go into battle, little Myara, ancl then you'll really start to learn things. - Why not leave her alone if it's me you want? Because right now you're China's and until he gets tired of you, I get to dance with Belinda. Leave her alone, stop mauling her. - China said I could have her, so you stay out of this. You bitch, leave her alone! Get your hands off her, leave her alone! Listen, you stupid little cunt! There's one thing you better learn awful fast, I don't like interference. If you're nice to me, Belinda, I could get you out of here. Hmmm? Do you really want to escape? All right, I'll help you. Just do what I want. Enjoy it, relax. Come on! Move it! Move it along! Get a move on, go on! - China, this is Camargo, do you read me, over. Loud and clear. - I'll be with you in the morning. Roger, Camargo. I already have another full consignment to go. We hit a new seem about a week ago, it's producing beautiful stones. I'd say the best we've had. Oh, by the way, can you bring cigarettes ancl tobacco? I'm almost out of everything. Ancl a couple of cases of brandy as well. Well, that's about it, I guess. See you tomorrow. Will do, China, out. So the helicopter will be here tomorrow with supplies, all right? Hey! - I hope he remembers my guitar strings! Well I hope to hell he doesn't. Oh! Ready? All right. They're all eating lunch, no one will see you. Run! Belinda, look out! Belinda! Belinda! Yeah! Belinda! Son of a bitch! Kevin! No! No! China, I'm gonna kill you! That poor boy's jealous. All right, sweetheart. Now the fun is about to start. All right, bitch, this is it. Bastard's escaped! Put the girl in the cage! Now get out there and bring the son of a bitch back! I want him alive! Go on, get a move on! What are you waiting for? - Your boyfriend's run off and left you, sweetheart! Because you've been screwing around! Come on, move it, move it! Looking for me, China? - Why the hell did you come back here, you idiot? To kill you! Crazy fool! You don't have a gun, you don't stand a chance! That's what you think. You got six shots, China! Go on, fire! That's two down, China! If you can't do better than that, you haven't got a hope! That's another bullet wasted, China! Look out, Kevin! China! You've got one shot left! You better make it good this time or you're dead! - Unless you're holding a whole slew of aces up your sleeve, I think you've lost this round, Kevin! Try this one, sucker! Come on, China, you've got a choice. Make your decision, the snake or me. Come on, China, make up your mind. What's it gonna be? Quickly, Kevin, get me down. Kevin! Let me out of here! Kevin, let me down at once! Kevin, why won't you let me down? Please let me out of here, come on. That's it you guys, you're free. Go on, get the hell out of here! Go on! Go on! And you too! Get out of my sight, go on! Kevin, what're you playing at? You son of a bitch! You just wait till I get my hands on you! You'll pay for this, get me down! - But that's the best place to see the show from. The slaves, they've escaped! Let's get back to camp and see what happened, let's go! You are an insufferable, possibly male, definitely chauvinistic pig, you know that? I bet you're the kind that argues that a woman is only good for the bedroom and the kitchen! Kevin, they're here! Someone's killed the boss! It's the American! The girl's still there! Well let's shoot her for a start! Kevin, you're not a chauvinistic pig! I was kidding, I didn't mean it! Kevin! Oh, so you think it's funny, do you? You son of a bitch! Let's see if you laugh when I get through with you! You still mad at me? Come on, give me a little kiss. - Do you think we'll be able to hitch a ride out? I think we can do even better. My God, what's going on? China! China! Jesus Christ. Huh? What the? What the fuck, hey, come on! Hey! What do you think you're doing? Come back down, you bastard! Hey, don't leave me here! Hey! I'll pick you up on my next trip, with the police! Bastard! You bastard! - Do you really know how to fly a helicopter, Kevin? No, but I learn quickly. Oh God, I feel sick. Open that box and have a look. It'll make you feel fine. Kevin, they're so beautiful. A little souvenir. I had to take them because China twisted my arm so hard. I know he'd have been terribly offended if I'd refused. - I'm beginning to fall in love with you, Kevin. - Stop it now or I might start to believe you. Kevin! - No joining the mile high club on this trip! Kevin, couldn't you try and fly this thing in a straight line? I am flying in a straight line. - No you're not, it's swaying from side to side! - Well it's a Brazilian helicopter. What does that mean? It's got built-in rhythm.
