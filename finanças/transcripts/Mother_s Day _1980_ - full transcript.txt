All right, dirt bags. Now, kiss your neighbor, and say "thank you for sharing with me. I love you." Thank you for sharing with me. I love you. Thank you for sharing with me. I love you. Thank you for sharing with me. I love you. And remember. Once you go out those doors, don't stop to think about what you feel. Because once you stop to think about what you feel, you doubt what you know. And once you doubt what you know, you can assume you don't know it. Why? Because you don't act on it. Once you know what you know, you act on it. Now listen to me. As of 5:00 PM, right now, you are all graduates of EGO. Congratulations. It's like we built this beautiful Emerald City with Oz, based on like real love and real feelings. Man, so many feelings, all of us. That Ernie. His mother must be so proud. Such a nice boy. And it's like we all had the materials provided inside us. And-- and God handed them down to us. Charlie, we've got to split. You know it takes like 15 minutes to walk to the bus station. Maybe we can get a lift from somebody, huh. Charlie. Oh, don't be silly. I was going to offer you a lift anyways. Ain't like I was giving a ride to strangers after all we've been through. You know, after this weekend, I really realized just how beautiful people are underneath. Hey, lady. You like music? Sure, sure, sure. Is your husband waiting for you? What? I mean do you live in the woods all alone? Oh, I'm prying. It's just that people are my hobby. Right, Charlie. For sure. You city folks think because I'm living out in the way I'm out of touch. But I say only happens if you let it. TV and all, I keep in touch with everything. I take what's good from the city, and the rest you can keep. And one of the good things is that nice young man on the morning news. I heard all about this here EGO training from him. Damn. Oh, not again. Not to worry, honey. Happens all the time. Do you need any help? Oh no. You'll get your hands dirty. Don't you trouble yourself. The hood didn't release. Can you pull that doohickey again? Come on. No. No. Thanks. Oh god. Stop it, boy. That's enough. Get off. You too. Please. Please don't kill me. Please. What have I done? Please. Please don't kill me. Thank you for sharing with me. I love you. Darlings, you have made your mother very proud. Come on. One minute. Abbey, will you sit down. - Come on. - The library. Would you look at us. You must have taken this roll last semester before finals. There she is. - Trina hard at work. - Jesus. Who took that picture? You two are real sneaks. Ralph Loman. Now, I see why you two hit off so well, Trina. Look. The dorm. That one comes in-- I ditched him five months ago. Our sign. You know, I'm working on a new sign. It'll take up the whole door. And our names will be much bigger. You know, we should have calling cards and stuff. Oh god. Look at that one. So that after we play a joke on someone or something we can just casually hand them a card. Yeah. Like "Congratulations, you've just been goofed on by the Rat Pack." Do you really think that Paul is dead? Abbey Warnett-- , pothead. If my mother ever saw this picture. Now, we're getting to Jackie's arty slides. Ooh. Icky. - Changed the slide. - OK. OK. Look, Mr. Conroy. Mr. Conroy. That guy was the worst teacher in life. Oh Jesus. Was he ever? How did you take those without him seeing you? Wait. Wait. Just watch. Look. Oh god. Look you. My god. The rubber spider. That one was so great. Real funny. I had an exam the next morning at 9:00. You know. My god. Boy. What a scream. I'm not surprised how immature you two can be. What was this? The making of the All-American beauty. Remember that one? Don't be gross, Trina. Who was I seeing then? Oh my god. Oh, you'd had a date after curfew, and we had to lower you out the window in a sleeping bag. And it worked too. We got you all the way to the ground without a scratch. Look. Bill Fillmore. Let's keep living together and having fun, even after college. Come on. Can you see us at 80 year-old roommates? At least, we can have Rat Pack reunions. I wonder what we will be doing. You know, like 10 years from now. What are our lives going to be like? Trina darling, this is simply you. There are three rules in the film business. Distribution, distribution, and distribution. Trina darling, where did you find all these attractive men? Maggie, I simply told them you'd be here. I want the hors d'oeuvres cleared in 15 minutes sharp. And tell Joshua to stop jerking off in the kitchen and bring some ice now. Yes, ma'am. Jonathan, so nice of you to make it. What was it Kubrick said? The manipulation of light and color produces an illusion of profound intensity. No, man. You take the Hollywood freeway to Sepulveda. Not Sepulveda Boulevard, Sepulveda Lane. What was it Kubrick said? You got to have gross points. Not net points. But gross points. Did you say Grosse Pointe. I'm from Grosse Pointe. Frank, your party last night was just incredible. Well, thank you very much. Madam, a telegram for you. Excuse me. Who is it? Who is it? It's me, mother. Did you lock the door? Yes, mother. It's about time you got home, slut. You're out whoring around when you know I have to take my pills at 6:00. Don't tell me where you've been. I'm a sick woman. You know that. You never do a damn thing for me after all I've done for you. If I could walk, I wouldn't ask you for anything. But I'm a sick woman. I'm a sick woman. I'm a sick woman. Do you hear me? The doctor said I need help at night. You know that. He said I can never be left alone. But you don't care about your own mother. Do you hear me? I'm a sick woman. I'm a sick woman. Hi, Winston. Hello, Jackie. This is your mother. I ran into Davey Babcock last night. You remember. Now, I'm not pushing him on you. But your father thinks he's going to be very successful. He'll be calling you. Trust me on this. I'm your mother. Hi, Jackie. The accountant says we file joint this year even with our divorce. Sorry I never got back to you, but, uh, you know how things are. You son of a bitch. I thought you had something to do today. Yeah. But things came up. Hey, babe, I thought you'd be happy to see me. I am. But I've got to get going. That's cool. Now, listen. Do you mind if I crash here for the weekend? Thanks. You're a doll. Is there anything I can do for you? Help you pack or something? No thanks. I'm all set. You know, Jackie. - I envy you. - Sure. No really. I wish I could work a steady job. I don't know. Sometimes I wish I wasn't so sensitive. Yeah. That I didn't have so much art in me. You don't realize how hard it is on the male ego to just stay in bed while his lover goes off to work. You know I'd work 9:00 to 5:00 if I could, but-- the damn theater just won't let go of me. One question. Where do you keep your razor. Look on the side of the bathtub. Listen, Ted. I'll be seeing you. I love you. Take care. Have a good weekend, Winston. Yeah. Sure. I'm supposed to have a good weekend stuck here in the city. Hey, if you're free for the weekend, there's a lot going on. This is New York. Free for the weekend? Free for the weekend? Free for the weekend? I'll never be free as long as I'm a black man in America. Rockefeller makes a million dollars a day. Rockefeller makes a million dollars a day. Rockefeller makes a million dollars a day. Rockefeller makes a million dollars a day. Hey, you dames from the Hoboken Historical Society? I've been driving for 40 years in these goddamn-- Hey, you know where a girl can get laid around here? Nice of you to show up, Jackie. Jackie. God, you look good. My cable said we were supposed to meet at 2:00. What'd yours say, Abbey? Well, mine did say 2 o'clock. Hey, you two girls are lucky I even showed up at all. Real nice of you to drop by. Abbey and I were just getting into the unspoiled natural beauty of-- where the hell are we anyway? Rexburg, New Jersey. Well, I don't know about the two of you, - but I'm getting out of here. - Wait for me. Now, where are we going? It can't be any place around here. This is awful. Are we going skin-diving? It's so good to be with you two again. I can't believe it. I still have that garnet necklace - that you gave us last year. - Mine too. It's so nice. I never take mine off. Jackie. What? You're still wearing your ring. Oh, I can't believe it. That tacky school ring. All right. On with the bags. Oh my god. Do you mean we have to put these on again? Come on, Jackie. Couldn't we just forget it this year? And have you know where we're going. Pew, Jackie. What do you keep in these bags, kitty litter? Just shut up and put the bags over your heads. Come on. Both of you. Hey, which way do you guys want to go. Left or right? What do you mean which way do we want to go? I got a decision. Quick. Come on. Quick. Which way? Do you know where we're going? Got to be left or right. Left. Left. - Left. - Right. No, right. Right. God. Do you at least know what you're doing? We want beer. We want beer. We want beer. We want beer. Hi. Thanks, but that'll be all for today. How much? Oh, by the way, how far is it to Deep Barons? You alone? No. With friends. Two of them. How far is it to Deep Barons? Why do you want to go up there, lady? Don't go messing up in Deep Barons. Oh look. What? Oh, Jesus. I thought I told you two to stay in the car. Jackie. Jackie. I don't want that one. God, you guys. Wait a minute. Hold up. Both of ya. There we go. It's all right. We're all college roommates. Jesus. You get what you deserve in them Deep Barons, you lez-beans. You won't be causing no one no trouble no more. All clear. You got to be kidding. Come on. We'll never get there. Wait a minute. Let me put this beer can down. We'll never find our way back. Hang on. How you doing back there? OK. Gee. We'll be able to find our way back from all these beer cans. I'm serious, Jackie. If we're still in New Jersey, I must see the Newark Library. Oh hey, did you guys lock the car doors? Jackie, don't be so paranoid. We're not in the city. This is a great dance, Jackie. Great. - Drink. - Wait. I can't drink this. No stopping. No stopping! That's awful. Trina, remember the time when we used to put Jackie in the sleeping bag when she was going to meet the Dobber? Yeah. And you almost dropped me every single time. Watch it. Tree. We could hardly pick up that bag. - She was so fat. - Yeah. Thanks a lot. I noticed you lost a lot of weight too. That'll teach me to say things like that. - Oh. - Move 'em out. Raw hide. Jackie, you make me take one more step, and you'll be served with a summons from my podiatrist when we get back. Move to Bev Hills and already you forgot how to walk. Gee. What's Paul Williams really like? Hey, no one's forcing you to live in these septic tanks. You've chosen the grit. And I have chosen the glamor. Watch out. It's bear doody over there. This is going to be a long weekend. Hey, wait for me. Welcome to our weekend. Oh, Jackie. It's perfect. You mean they don't have them in Brazil. Nuh-uh. You know these weekends are the only times I ever get stoned anymore. Aren't you getting a little tired of this whole thing? I mean last year's was ridiculous. I brought a whole suitcase of summer clothes with me, and we went skiing. What about Budapest? Jackie, I told you. Outside the United States they don't have marshmallows. Then, it's like the only really American food. Next year's your year, right? Yeah. I'm getting a little bored with this whole thing. I mean once a year, no matter what, we drop everything and get together for our little mystery weekend together. Aren't we getting a little too old for it? You wouldn't really think of not showing up one year, would you? I mean, sometimes, I think that these weekends are the only thing that keeps me sane from one year to the next. Where's Jackie? Jackie? Jackie? Jackie? Where are you? Jackie! Jackie, are you all right? Oh my god. What's the matter? Can't I tinkle without asking permission? What? Do you always carry a knife when you take a leak? Sure. It's a jungle out there. What are you afraid of? Being jumped by a gang of wild Puerto Rican chickens? Look, Jackie, one weekend a year you can relax. When you're with the Rat Pack, no one dumps on you. Hey, you talking to me? Are you talking to me? I know how to handle know myself. Oh yeah, like with-- with-- oh, what was his name? Christ, don't bring that up again. Yeah, Jackie. What was his name? Dobson. Brad Dobson. His name is Brad Dobson, but-- everybody calls him Dobber. Dobber. What an asshole. Goodbye, Dobber. You know, I don't know if this is really the way to do it. Jackie, this guy's been shitting on you for six months. There he is. Where? Hey, doll. Give me a kiss. Brad, not here. OK. OK. I can wait. Come on. This is awesome, babe. It's awesome. You know, I once pitched a no-hitter against SC on this mound. It's the same mound where you and I are going to be doing the dirty deed. Brad. Yeah. You know, Jack, I got to hand it to you. You held out a lot longer than most broads. You showed an amazing amount of control. Hey, Brad. I forgot the body oils. Hey, I thought I told you could call me Dobber. Yeah. Right. Hey, we'll be waiting for you. [MUSIC TOMMY JAMES AND THE SHONDELLS, ["I THINK WE'RE ALONE NOW"] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Wilfred Memorial Stadium. It's a beautiful night for our first annual asshole invitational. And they're off. Tonight, we're thrilled to present that guy who dreams in instant replay, the biggest asshole on campus, Brad-- "Call me Dobber" -- Dobson. And there goes Dobson now. Ladies and gentlemen, just look at that boy run. Such flare. Such grace. Have you ever seen anything like it? Oh god. Rat. Pack. - Forever. - Rat. - Pack. - Forever. - Rat-- - Pack forever. Rat Pack forever. Rat Pack forever. Ah, poor Jackie. Men were always pushing you around. Men. Being pushed around is the story of Jackie's life. You know, sometimes, I wish I still had the Rat Pack to protect me. Remember when we were seniors and Trina brought in that calendar with the pictures of lonely men with no clothes on? God. You almost had a heart attack. Bet you'd never saw a naked man before. Probably not. Had to wheel you to the infirmary. Trina. I'm going to get you if it takes me the rest of my life. I'm going to get you, you twerp. You guys. Come on. Here, Jackie. Oh yeah. You know, we could really make this place into something. Six lanes of blacktop right there to the lake. Pave that whole area there for a parking lot. Maybe a taco stand here. Some landfill, shopping centers, casinos. Ah, Jackie, look at that little fish over there. He's so cute. He's just swimming around the rocks there. - Look. - Where? Underneath the rocks. Look. A fish? He's right over by your line. Ah, I got him. - I got him. - Wait. Wait. Wait. I got him. No. You have to do this. You have to turn him around him like this. You have to do it slowly, Abbey. I remember. I got it. - Because I saw-- you have to-- - God! Look how big he is. I don't believe it. I got him. I got him. No, I got him. Look at that. Oh my god. Look how big he is. Look at him. Oh, Jackie. You got him. Look it. - What do you think it is? - Oh, it's beautiful. What is it? I think it's a Boston scrod. God. Yeah, he is. Go on. Come on. Oh my god. He's not going to bite you. Yes, he is. It's a goddamn trout. Thanks, Trina. Thanks, Jackie. You're welcome. What for? I've never thanked you. For what? For being my friends. For getting me to do things I wouldn't do by myself. For making me feel like somebody. You're welcome. But you are somebody, Abbey. We only let you see that. Let me out! Get off me. Goddammit. What the hell is this? Get your hands off me. Jackie, what's happening? What the hell is this? Goddamn. Who is it? Damn it. Goddamn it. Stop it! Abbey? Abbey? Are you there? What's happening? Jackie? Come on. All right. Hey, Ma! Ma, we got some. We got the girls at Fonzi Lake. Yeah. And I got the one that almost got away.

I got two of them, and you got one, for crying out loud. That's cause you're bigger, dumb. I'm not dumb. You're dumb. You like punk. Shut up. Mom don't like you to call me dumb. Disco is stupid. You stink. Come on. Help me with these. All right, Ike and Addley. Now let's see what you brought mother. Well, let's see her. Get on here. Open up. You're a real pretty girl. Don't touch me, you sadistic motherfucker. Don't you do that. - Addley. - Get off me. Addley. Get off of me. Damn it. Goddamn it. Fuck you crazy bastards. We got her now. Hey, don't you do that to me, you bitch. Ike! Ma, I want her first, her first. Not as the first one, dear. Her first. Oh, but Ma. She kicked me-- Ike! That's it. Hold her arms. Gross. Come on. I'm going to put this around you. We're going to have some fun now. Come on. Come on. Come on. Get out of here. I'll see you later. Have a good day. You. Let's go. Come on. Light the way, Addley. What's the matter? You don't like it. Take your time. That's real nice. Addley, what do you want to do? I don't know. What do you want to do? I don't know. What do you want to do? The park bench. The park bench. - The park bench. - Yeah. OK, Ma. The park bench. OK. But watch out for splinters. Come on, Ike. Come on. Stay right here. Don't you move. I've been waiting for this a long time. Sit down. Sit down. All right. All right. Now, it's a beautiful day. See? See? You're all alone in the park, sitting on a park bench. And you're reading something real good. Yeah.

Good. Good boy. OK, lady. Now, walk like a little girl. Hey, little girl! Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Could she stay in our room tonight, Ma, huh? Yeah, can she, Ma? Well, OK.

Addley, you're going to get blood all over the floor. Now, give me that. I guess it made it's way out of the trap. Must have spent all night chewing its own leg off. Aw, poor fella. Finish your cheese spread, Ike. It's good for the liver. What happened to your girlfriend? Uh, she ain't feeling so good this morning, Ma. I, uh-- I don't think she'll be coming down. Can we go feed the other two now? OK. But hurry down. We gotta do our exercises. My boys. Breakfast. Breakfast. Breakfast. Breakfast. Hey, it looks like my little babe's been sleepwalking.

There was a penguin in showbiz. There was? I'm going to get you, Addley. I'm going to get you. Well, look what we've got here. You sure are frisky, aren't you? I'm going to get you some burger bits. I know you love burger bits. And I know they're good for you too. They've got all the vitamins and minerals a young pup needs to grow into a healthy dog. And you know they're good for you too.

You bitch! You bitch! Abbey. Jesus! Abbey. Ike. I can't. We're fucked. He's the police. We'll get them. We'll get those bastards. Business is booming. Sun-worshipers say they love it. But dermatologists are worried about the nations new year-round suntan craze. Amy Levins concludes her special report "Tanning Clinics, Safe or Sorry." What types of reactions do you get from the customers? What do they say? Oh, I have everything from, "Oh, this is the most marvelous thing I ever heard of. This is what I've been waiting for all my life " to " this is the height of--" Addley, I just doubled you. Ma, I can't with those girls out there. Now, that is Ike's job. And Ike will bring them back. Now, come on, Addley. You got to always want to play, because that's polite. Well, I want to be out there with Ike, getting the girls and stuff. Girls, girls, girls. What about me? I want someone with here with me when Queenie's on the prowl. And besides, ain't we having fun? Grandma says Queenie's dead. Now, come on, Addley. It's your roll. Save up your money and go to Jamaica, or take a trip to one of New Jersey's new tanning salons. All my life I ain't never seen no Queenie. Ike says you say Queenie's still alive just so you can keep us around you. I try to give you boys a respectful life, and this is the thanks I get. OK. Get out there and have fun with your brother Ike. Don't worry about me being here with nobody around. Oh, Ma. Addley, my sister Queenie was evil from birth. She was the most contrary baby they ever did see. Why, she was the only baby they ever seen with a full head of long white hair when she was born. And you know she broke my neck while I was still in the crib. Yeah, but Grandma says she shot Queenie after that. Cut off her ear to prove it. That ear don't mean nothing. I know she set Queenie loose, because I seen her, living like a swamp rat, feeding off animal waste and garbage and flesh. And that no more than 50 yards away from where I'm sitting right now. I saw Queenie outrace a mongrel wolf and then rip open its throat with her bare hands just so she could see it bleed. And you want to leave me here with nobody around. Ah, Ma. I don't want to leave you alone. Then, you will never leave me. You just promise me that you and your brother will never leave me ever. Yes, Ma. I want Jackie to see this. Jackie, everywhere you turned in life you got shit. Well, now, we'll do the fighting back for you. It's the only thing we can do. We can't give up. We've gotten this far. Rat-- Pack. Pack forever. There's a film on your teeth to the gum and beneath that can make any smile look inferior. For this film on your teeth-- After all my teaching and working and training, this is what I get. He loses two city gals in the woods. B-O-T-E. Boat. I got it, Ma. Ouija says they're on a boat. Idiot. They can't go nowhere without the car. Addley, you tell your brother Ike a hound dog that comes home with nothing in his mouth should keep it closed. Ike, ma says a hound dog that comes home-- empty-handed should keep-- keep your big fat mouth shut. Shut up, idiot! I got ears. Ma. Ma, she fooled me. I'm all tore up about it, Ma. I'm sorry I sh-- I'm sorry I shamed you, Ma. Give me another chance. I'll kill them good. Addley, you tell your brother this time we're going to do it right. No more police car gags. You go into the kitchen and bring me my woods map. Get the antenna out of the bag. Ma. Ma. I'm really going to make you proud of me this time, Ma. I'm going to make you real proud of me this time, Ma. I'm going to get 'em good. Oh, Ike. Ike. Come on, Abbey. He's dead. Let's get him out of here. You killed my brother. You killed my brother. You killed my brother. You killed-- You killed my brother. You-- you killed him. You killed my brother. Help! Help! Son of a bitch. You wanted him, didn't you? Insurance companies said today, they'll stop writing policies on high risk drivers if the state orders them to spread out the cost to other customers. The word came from Michael McCain, the counsel for Allstate Insurance. He's concerned about a proposal being studied by the state insurance department that will slash premiums in high risk urban areas and among young drivers.
