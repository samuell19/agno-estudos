Doyle, why don't you leave your suitcase there and follow us? Kitchen's just through here. Right, thanks. It's Fuckwitt's father. Well, given in the circumstances we wouldn't normally be calling on you but there's a shortage of beds. Doyle's gonna stay with us for a little bit, over the holidays. Just until a place comes up somewhere suitable. Now girls, I need you to understand that your grandpa, he's got a disease. Yeah? It's called Alzheimer's disease and he gets really confused about things. He gets kind of mixed up about how to do things and what time it is. It's quarter to two. Thanks, sweetheart. He's gonna need a lot of love and care. You think you girls can do that? Great. How about you, Lou? Think you can give your grandpa a lot of love? Okay. So Rhia, you'll call me if there's any problems, won't you? Yeah. I mean you're a lot younger than I thought you'd be. I'll be fine. Goodbye Doyle. Take care, dear. I know. You're staying here, with your family, yeah? Sit down. That's it. Great. Just great. You're not sleeping in my room. We'll just move some of Lou's things. And you can put your stuff on the side table too. There's lots of room. I think it'll be really nice. Doyle used to be a sailor in the merchant navy, did you know that? On a boat? Well duh. Have you been to Fiji? Yes. I've been all over the Pacific. Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu, New Zealand. I treated him like a friend. I took him under my wing. And how does he repay me? Calls himself a sailor? And he wouldn't know if the queen Mary was parked up his ass. When I see him, do you know what I'll do? What? Gonna get my hands around his jocky neck and I'll squeeze, squeeze till his eyes pop out. Oh yes, I'll get that son of a bitch. Fred fucking Fletcher. Hey, that's enough. Oh no. I know, I'll teach him a lesson. Mark my word, Fred Fucking Flet... Who wants some cheese? Are you gonna ask him? About dad? No. Why not? 'Cause I don't give a shit. I do. Doyle. Get off me! Leave me alone! Rhia! No, no! Help! - Help me! - I'm not gonna hurt- - No, don't you touch me! No! Doyle! No! He won't have a shower. He's starting to stink. Annie?

I gotta be at work in 10 minutes. No way. You're not leaving me with him. It's the holidays. Lou, can you please be a bit cooperative for once? Cartwheel. Do you wanna see a handstand? Look at me! I'm dancing! Looking at me! Look! What do you think you're doing? Thieving? - Is that what it is? - No! Dirty little thief. You're the thief. This is my room. Give that to me. Why isn't she looking after you, huh? Why'd you have to come here? We don't want you. Annie. Give that to me. Come on, give it! Give it. You're crazy. What's going on? He kicked me. I did not. Jesus Lou, just leave him alone. Girls! Can you come and clean up this mess please? We don't wanna. We're still playing. He's cracked. Get rid of him. He didn't hurt anyone. He kicked me. Doyle!

And this is Doyle, their grandfather. I already had a shower damn you. I can look after myself. He's got Alzheimer's. I'm cooking dinner. Wanna stay? Mom said you've got a Commodore. Yeah, that's right. It's the SV6 with elotech engine. Hammer's way more than the old V6, but pretty good anyway so- - This is the most disgusting thing I've ever eaten. I should probably get going, the boys will be waiting. Okay. Everybody up! Fire in the engine room! She's taking water! Abandon ship! Calm down! Calm down! You're not in a boat, come here! You're not in a boat! Let go, you son of a bitch! Get up here! Get up here! Where's Fletcher? This is all his fault! Shut up. You're scaring the girls! Shut up! - Get off me!

Beauty, for beauty. For you, Annie. Thanks. You're welcome. Hey. Maybe we should all go to the beach tomorrow. Cosmo can take us in the Commodore. You sure? Yeah. He'll do anything I ask him to. I promise. Annie. Could I have this dance? I doubt it. Got any Coke? Only orange. It's a kid's drink. Oh, I need coffee. She's not the marrying kind, if you know what I mean. Lani, come and get your breakfast. Do you think we'll have fish and chips? Uh-huh. It smells disgusting. Shush. Keep still. Oh God. Can't believe I've got to be at another Barbie in two hours. Get that stuff off, you look like a skank. Like you can talk. You said we were going to the beach. You promised. Yeah, I did promise. And it's a beautiful day. I can't today, I'm sorry. We've gotta go to a party. And it's a birthday party so it'd be rude if we didn't go. There might be balloons there, do you want me to bring you back a balloon? I'm gonna go get dressed. She's a selfish bitch. Give her the sack. The boot. Get rid of her. It's a great idea. From now on, she's sacked. You can't do that. Yes I can. I can do whatever I want. What are you doing? I'm going anyway. You coming? But we haven't got any money. I've got money. Can you see that? Okay. We should really get going soon, yeah? Yeah, yeah. I'm just going for a shower. Shh. Turn it. See? Look, a boat. A freighter. Where do you think it's going? It could be anywhere. To Fiji? Possibly. In Fiji, all over the Pacific, the wind is so warm. It's so soft. It's like a caress. What's a caress? I want to go. We could stowaway. You'd get caught. Doyle is a very sick man. He needs looking after. I am looking after him. We're all looking after him. Doyle. How are things here for you? It seems that I've lost my marbles but other than that, I'm fighting fit. It's just not good enough Rhia. Do you understand? He needs to be watched 24/7. I missed the party. I'm sick of this. I'm so sick of this. I'm only 27, you know? Where's my keys? Rhia? Please don't go. - Get off. - Just talk to me. Just please, just talk to me. There's nothing to talk about, all right? Please. Just- - Please. Please. Please don't go. Get away! He's leaving because of you! They all leave because of you! What about P? Pineapple. Yeah P. Oh, hello. Where is he? Where's who? Why won't he come back? Why won't who come back? Dad. My dad. Ah, yes. Yes, this is the place. This is where things happened. Lots of things. Everything went around and around. And around. All will be well Annie. Don't you worry yourself. Brought your paper. Thanks. Hey, I got a new PSP. Cool. Um, do you wanna try it sometime? Okay. Okay. All right. See ya. See ya. Fred fucking Fletcher. Annie. Yeah. This is the thing. The thing is, Well, the thing is that- What can... What can I offer you? I mean, what do you need? You could have anyone you choose? I mean, I've got the, I've got the neccessibles. I mean, I have, I have, I have everything you need. Will you marry me? I love you. This is how you put your blush on. First you should a very, very soft brush. Otherwise your teeth will go all crinkly. Dip the soft brush in water and then into the blush. You don't dip it in water. Shush. Then you put it onto your cheeks. Ooh! And now, we put on the lipstick. The best part. Hey, why don't we all do something tomorrow? And you should get red lips- Really, really red lipstick. Then you wipe it onto a tissue- Open up. Action stations. Get down. Open the door. Get down. This is stupid. I'm not hiding. For goodness sake Lou, get down. Why don't you just pay? With what? Fairy sprinkles? We've got money now. Come, I can hear you in there. Open up. Colin Buchanan, BDG credit agency. Please, come in. Thank you. Are you Rhia O'Connor? Consider yourself served. Start with the TV. Not the TV. Unplug it. Got it? I got it. Watch the tree. Yeah. You crazy bastard. This is all your fault. Now we've got nothing. We've got nothing. Shut up. You're hopeless. We don't need you anymore. - You're sacked. - You're as mad as he is. You heard the lady. Get fucked, both of you. All right, that's enough! Open the door! This is my house! No, it's not. You rent it. I'm calling Mrs. Marchetti. Through here. You got it? Yep, got it. There you are. What's wrong? I thought I'd lost you. I'm here. All right then. Something's burning. It's the cane. They burn it before they cut it down. Oh. Oh. It's hard to catch. What are you doing? We're getting married. It's not fair! Really, really difficult. Take it off. No. Lou, it's not funny. It's not a game. It's wrong. You know? I mean, what if he- You're too young to understand. I'm nearly 12. If there's one more thing like this he's gonna have to go. I'm thinking roses here. A whole bed of them. And climbing wisteria for the fence. And, one of the other kind, the um, you know, the smelling kind. That's the sort. We have to stop. Stop what? We can't play the game anymore. You better take this. Why? I told you. I can't do it anymore. Lou. There you go. Yeah. And jump. Whoa. All right, go again. No, no. Hello Mr. O'Connor. You thieving bastard. Told you to stay away, didn't I? No stop, what are you doing? I've got you now, Fletcher. He's not Fletcher, he's Blake! Let go! Mom! You're not going to get her! Mom! Mom! Doyle, let go! Doyle, let go of him! You all right? Yeah. I thought you love me. Jesus Christ. I better go. He can stay here. I'll be in touch but if you need me for anything, or if you have any trouble in the meantime, just call me. He really is loony. No, he's not. They found a place for him. He's going tomorrow. It's for the best. For you too Lou. You don't care about me. You don't care about any of us. All you care about is yourself. That's not true. Yes it is. I hate you. I hate you, I hate you, I hate you. Lou. Lou. Go away. Please. Please Lou, let me in. And then the big house, they tried to do it all at once and they all fell into the room. Did they? Did they? That wasn't true. This is what really happened. Doyle. You've come back to me, Annie. Let's go, now. Run away. Where? Anywhere. Tahiti, Hawaii, Fiji. We could stowaway. We can go to Brisbane. Those ships are going to Brisbane. Oh. Big ones. They must go all over the world. Lou. Fucking broke. What's your pin number? Forget it. 1, 3, 7, 9. Hi. We'll have to go to the police. We're going home by bus? We're going to Brisbane. Stowaway. Remember? Fiji, Vanuatu, New Caledonia. Maybe even New Zealand. They're coming out now. Jesus, Lou where are you? She is so precocious. What? Um, it's precocious, just means that she's I know what it means. You know what? You dumped him with us so you wouldn't have to deal with him. She's been taking care of him. We're going home by bus? We're going away. From everything. We're going home by bus? No. I've gotta go home now. I thought you wanted to go? Don't you wanna go away with me? Don't you wanna feel the wind? See the Pacific again? No, I have to go home. I have to go home now. We can't go home. Don't you understand? We can't go home. You have to understand if we go home, they'll take you away. No, no. Doyle! Ohh! Come on. I'll take you home. You won't forget me, will you? Please. Never forget me. How could I ever forget you? I love you. I know. Doyle! Are you alright? Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you. Okay. Okay, we're gonna go through a bit of a drive now Doyle. Yeah, I'm gonna make you a nice cup of tea. Would you like that? Yeah. It sounds lovely. Okay. Come on then, come on then. Annie? Are you coming? I'm okay. I wanted him to stay. I know you did honey. I'm gonna do mine over here. Beautiful. We don't need any more faces. Look. It's a freighter. Where do you think it's going? I don't know. Somewhere.
