[eerie music playing] [stereo playing] [banging] No! Leave us alone. I know what today is. But anniversary or not, this year I refuse! I'm not letting you out, and I am not feeding you. And you must be quiet! [whispers] I know that you know, that my granddaughter is in this house, visiting. She's innocent like I was. And she's gonna stay that way, and there's nothing, nothing, nothing you can do, because I will destroy you before you touch her! Now, shut the fuck up! And you leave us alone. [growling] You can complain all you want. You are never getting out! [kissing] [gasping] How is this possible? [sucking] [moaning] How did you... No! Oh, no. No, please! No, no! Yes! Yes! Oh! [moaning] No! [moaning] Yes! Oh, yes! I'm ready! [Nana] [screaming] No! Nana? Oh, darling, I'm so sorry! -What? -Oh, this is all my fault! I should have known that it was going to try something when I wouldn't let it in. But it ends tonight! Put your clothes on. Nana? [growling] Shit! Nana? Nana? -Do you remember this? -[growling] Do you? Not Dawn. No... Not Dawn. If you want somebody... You take me. [loud growling] Nana, are you down here? [Nana] [screaming] No! Nana? What's happening? What's wrong? Nana, I can't get the door open. It's shut! [Nana] No! Nana? [whispers] Nana? [dramatic music playing] [gasping] [growling] No! [moaning] No! [screaming] [screaming] [gasping] [growling] [door rattling] [screaming] [explosion] [fast paced music playing] Trust me, you've made the right decision. You two will be so... God, just so happy here! Can't believe we finally got our own home! I told you we'd get there. I can't believe it came fully furnished. Are you sure the previous owners don't want any of it? No, it's all property of Miss Black's. Ever since she... left, [laughs nervously] there's nobody around to claim it. Not even her family, huh? No. No. Well, ever since the horrible incident with their daughter in the basement, which would never ever happen again, by the way, they want to have nothing to do with it, so they... they... decided to put the house up for sale once the State allowed them to do so and told my agents just to... Get rid of it! Seems odd. No, no! [realtor] It's not uncommon when people face this kind of family tragedy. But only because of bad memories and stuff. Which is why we're playing it safe. We're replacing the furnace. [realtor] You are very smart. [realtor] Refer a friend! [laughing] How about we christen the couch first, before my back gives up? Stop it, put me down! [laughing] How about... We start in the kitchen? Well, to be fair to the entire house, I think every room should be included. Mm, it's a lot of rooms. You're sure you gonna be up for that? As long it's with you, I'm sure I'll rise to the occasion. Oh, that's such a bad pun. Hey! You want a quick word or hot sex? -[faucet opens] -[screams] -What was that! -Oh, you're welcome. -Mm-hm. -Uh-huh. [laughing] [distant clang] [mysterious music playing] What's down there? If I'm not mistaken, the basement. Well, maybe we can skip the basement. As long as it doesn't get jealous. [Jennifer] Romantic mood officially over. [door opens] [door creaks] Hello? [clanging] I'm gonna check it out. Really? I refuse to be intimidated by my own house. [footsteps] [distant clanging] It's cold down here. What's that? [man] Just me. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. [exhales] Name's Oscar. I'm the electrician. You called us about replacing your furnace. Right. I didn't think you were coming until tomorrow. [Oscar] I had some down time, so I thought I'd check it out today. That real estate lady... [laughing naughtily] Yeah, she let me in. Yeah, I didn't see your truck out in front. Sorry. This is my wife, Jennifer. I am Paul. I'd shake, but it's kinda dirty down here. Got it. So listen, you don't seem to have any problem with your heating. Good furnace. Built to last. Apparently, there was a fire here a couple of years ago and a girl got burnt pretty badly. [laughing] I wouldn't go sticking your face in there. These suckers get pretty hot. Damn hot. Yeah, well, if we were to replace this one, how much would it cost? Well, I'll let you know when I'm done with my assessment. Just trying to figure out where all these pipes lead. Lot of pipe down here. Okay, we'll just leave you to it, and then you'll let us know when you have an estimate? -Will do. -[Jennifer clears throat] [Jennifer] Nice to meet you. Same here. Oh hey! You wouldn't happen to have a key to this door, would you? You see, this pipe up here goes through the wall into there and this door, it's stuck, locked or something. Sorry, we only have keys to the main doors. That's all right. I'll figure it out. Thank you. [banging] [banging] [clangs] [dog barking] -Mmm-- -[screams] Where were we? Wanna have some fun time? With Oscar, the pervy electrician standing by? I don't think so. We'll lock him in the basement so he can't watch. [laughing] Forget it! Absolutely no sexual activity until creepy Mr. Fix-It is gone. [metallic clang] [laughs] I guess I jarred you loose. What the fuck is this shit? [whispering] [thud] Oh, gimme a fucking break! [croaking] [heart thumping] Okay, fuck this shit. Get me out of here! [knocking] Get me the fuck out of here! Open the goddamn door. [thud] [groaning] [whistle] [laughing] Oh, Jesus. Fuck you. Jesus Christ! Too many weird fucking fumes in these cellars. It's playing with my head. [exhales] [thud] [groaning] [growling] [screaming] [struggling] [screaming] Help me, dear God! Oh God, help me! Hey, you almost done? It's getting late. Hello? Oscar? Good news. He's gone. [trickling] [door creaks] -[laughing] -It's like the second home run. -I'm filthy dirty. -That's what I love about you. No, I mean dirt-dirt. Real dirt. Unpacking dirt. I just wanna take a bath first. What comes second? Hopefully, both of us, if we're lucky. [laughing] Oh. Look what I found in the back of the closet. Wow. Spirit board. Mm-hm. I know exactly what I wanna do with it. So do I. [bangs shut] [soft music playing] [water running] [exhales] By the way, Karen's gonna come for a visit. -[Paul] Your sister, Karen? -Uh-huh. Isn't she still in school? Well, her school's so close now. -Wonderful. -What? I said, "Wonderful." I can't wait to see her again. She's such a... Joy to be around. Mm. Somebody really wants to get laid tonight. [exhaling] [faucet dripping] [whispering] [exhaling] What the... Someone is playful tonight! [moaning] [laughing] What are you doing down there? [moaning] Honey, if you keep that up, I won't be able to... [moaning] [moaning] [gasping] [gasping] [screams] [gasping] What? Hope you're ready for some real fun. Just give me a minute, okay? I don't think I can wait a minute. God, the weirdest thing just happened in the bathroom. Whatever it was, it must have turned you on big time. How did you know? I reap the benefits. Not yet, you haven't, but you will. Honey... Yeah. Whoa, honey. Honey, whoa, whoa, whoa. I need a little down time, all right? I mean, you practically drained me dry. Seriously? After all that talk about doing it in every room in the house, now you're not in the mood any more? Look, I'm sorry. I mean... -I warned you-- -Really? Okay, I get it. So you're just teach me a lesson, right? Because I made you wait. -Honey-- -Forget it. Forget it, it's fine. Let's just go to sleep. [exhaling] Good night. [sighing] [whistling] [door bangs] [soft music playing] [Paul] Well, the house is great. It's Jen that I don't get. You know, one minute she's sex-crazed, and the next, she's just crazed. Why don't you and I... We'll swap wives. Just for a week. -Hey, watch it! -No, really... I think I can help you with this. I'm really good at it. Do you wanna get punched? No... Please, no punching. But look, I'm just like you, all right? I mean, on the inside. There's nothing more that I wanna do than just curl up like a baby and go to sleep after the deal is sealed. But... But, there's nothing that pisses off a woman more than that, okay? I tried it once with Stacy. Once. Uno timo. Howard... When you're right, you're right. You're not as dumb as you look. I'm gonna make it up to her. Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. What, you're gonna make it up to her right now? Yes. Well, can you film it? Just... tell her it was my idea. Okay. [whistle] [washer starting abruptly] [gasping] [moaning] [washer rattling] [exhaling] [rattling] [gasping] [loud rattling] [explosion] Shit! Oh, shit. Oh, fuck! Oh, my God, you got to be kidding me! [screams] [water sprays] [doorbell rings] I forgot my key. Honey, what happened? I'm doing laundry. I don't think you're doing it right. I'm joking! [romantic music playing] I called the plumber. Couldn't fix it yourself, huh? Well, this coupled with your bathtub last night, I thought it wouldn't hurt to call an expert to check it out. The rest of the day and night is yours. I'll do whatever you want. Order in, go out. I'm at your service, my lady. I can use a little service. What's that? Nothing. Great. So, what'll it be? We did spend all of our money on this house. Seems a shame not to take advantage of it. In, it is. Quiet evening, just the two of us. You left out "romantic." -[growls] -[laughs] I was just getting to that part. [doorbell rings] You didn't tell the plumber to come tonight, did you? Tomorrow morning. If it's him, I'll tell him to come back. [Karen] Come back, my ass! Took me three buses to get here! How's it hanging, Paul? Karen, impeccable timing, as always. It's a gift. Is my domesticated other-half around? Karen? Oh, my God! You remember my name! You haven't totally brainwashed her, yet, huh? Aw, I thought you were coming in a few days. I was bored. Nice flowers, did you buy those, Paul? As a matter of fact... I did. That's so weird, they were fine a few minutes ago. They look fine to me, but I am going through my "black phase." This is the fruit of your labors. All those years of rich relatives really paid off. I bought this house with my money, our money. Must be nice when you can work for daddy. So, Karen, how's school? Sucks. How's your job? Quiet as usual? Kinda what you'd be expecting when you work in a bookstore. And how's your job, Paul? Fine. Took a couple of days off until we got all settled in. I'm sure they will survive without you. Okay. Great that you could come all this way down to see us. Must you be leaving so soon? Come on, guys, really? [Jennifer] Please... Look, I've got the guest room almost ready for you. Just come upstairs, let me show you around. [groaning] Good lord, what do you have in here? Rocks? Close. Crystals, brimstones. I'm dating this guy who's really obsessed with the whole psychic vibe thing. Hey, you want a tarot card reading? Maybe I can tell you how long you and Paul will be together. [thud] All right, trouble-maker. Hope this will do. So, you read any good books lately? [sarcastically] Ha ha. That gets you every time, doesn't it? Listen, do me a favor. Please, please, please, make an effort to be nice to Paul this time. -I always try. He hates me. -Because you hate him. -Because he hates me. -Oh, great! This is mature. Oh, honey... [clanging] Look, I don't hate him. I just think he's a spoiled, ungrateful, egotistical, self-centered mama's boy. Oh, is that all? Yeah. It's nothing personal. Huh? I wish I had a key. [lock clicks open] [whistle] Interesting design choice. Ah... okay. So... You're the flower killer. Yeah. What the-- Okay, okay, I'll be nice. I'm just trying to look out for my big sister. You know it's supposed to be the other way around, right? Yeah, but, I always try to be different. Oh, that's for sure. [fast paced music playing] [growling] [whistle] [thud] I did sense a little tension when I got here. You seem stressed. No, no, everything's fine. Mostly, I mean. Mostly? [ominous music playing] [echoing] We need you, Paul. [growling] We need you, Paul. [echoing] We need you, Paul. [screaming] [electricity crackling] [groaning] [groaning] [struggling] I'm... so... so... sorry. Okay, recap. Dangerous furnace, short-circuiting washing machine, creepy electrician... So, the moral of the story is, "Stay out of the basement." Pretty much. Hm. Then, perhaps you can use this. What is this? It's a necklace. It's used to ward off evil. For protection. Will it protect me against you? [whispering] Nothing can protect you from me. [whistle] [gasping] [gasping] [Jennifer] Paul? [Jennifer] Paul? We're just discussing dinner. Maybe he took off. No, he wouldn't do that. [loud footsteps] Paul? [thud] Geez. Jennifer. Karen. What were you doing down there? I was checking the washing machine. Oh. Any luck? No. No, it's best not to go down there at the moment. Yeah, well then, for once, we're in agreement. So listen, I was thinking... Maybe we should go out tonight. Stacy told me about a really great Middle Eastern restaurant that's near by, and I've heard good things about it. I thought we were staying in tonight. I know, but now we have a guest, honey. And we want to be good hosts, right? Take her out, show her the town. Good hosts? -Yes. -[Karen clears throat] Uh, sure. I am all over that. We haven't been out in quite a while. Okay, you wanna go upstairs and change, and we'll take my car? Yes, I will go change. Uh, okay, he's acting fucking weird. [sighing] He's trying to be on best behavior. I suggest you do the same. We're changing our plans for you. Don't forget that. [maitre d'hotel] Without a reservation, it's gonna be a few minutes. You may wait at the bar, if you wish. Bar sounds good. I could use a drink. [clears throat] Karen, you? -Always. -I don't like to wait. Let it go. We came to have a good time, right? Good times... Yes... Jennifer. I'm ready to have some fun. Hi. -What would you like to drink? -I'll take a red wine, please. -A Cuba Libre. -Red wine, Cuba Libre. Perfect. Tell me about this guy you're seeing. What's he like, what's his name? Oh, excuse me, do you work here? I do, but unfortunately, I just started my ten minute break. His name is Patrick. Someone else here would be happy to help you. Oh, I don't want someone else. I just want you. What the hell is your husband doing? He's probably just trying to get us a table earlier. -Cabernet. -Yeah, that's totally what he's doing. Can I let you in on a little secret? You couldn't have me if hell froze over. What if I told you-- [glasses clinking] To the keeper that Paul is. I could provide you with the most explosive sexual experience of your entire life. Four words. "Never going to happen." Never say never. Excuse me, Sir, can I help you with something from the bar? Milk. I'm sorry, Sir, we don't carry milk here. Can I offer you something else? Just those two things came to mind. You don't know what you're missing. [ominous music playing] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! How is this possible? What? No! I want my breasts back. [squelching] Oh! Table for three. In a few more minutes, Sir. Now. [choking] [exhaling] [coughing] Our table? Yes. Right this way. [Middle Eastern music playing in background] Mm. I forgot how good food tastes. Well, now that we've got a home, I'll be able to cook you genuine, home cooked meals. Mm! So, tell me some more about that psychic stuff you're studying. Forget about it. You guys are gonna think it's a bunch of bullshit any way. Not at all. I'm very interested in the subject. So, you know about crystals, astral projections, the occult? Intimately. I also know it's quite dangerous to play around with some of those things. Just ask Margaret Black. Oh, I'm sorry, you can't. She's dead. Who? That was the woman that used to own our house. How do you know Margaret Black was into the occult? Our real estate agent, Monica. When I pressed her for details about the house. As it turns out, young Maggie Black had a dark secret. One that she kept from her husband and entire family, for that matter. Ever since that party in her parents' basement... [Paul] I think it was in the early 70's. [man] I am the God of Hellfire. I gotta bring you, fire! [psychedelic music playing] [laughing] Peace, joy, love, Satan. Who invited those girls? I don't know. Don't look at me. I don't know them. She's the one who knows them. They're painting the wall. Oh... I... I met them at the party, last night. Pure magic! [laughing] Oh, my God! They painted everything! You have to clean this up! This is not what I wanted. Why fight what you desire, Maggie Black? -Oh! -We can show you a real good time. My parents are gonna be back soon, so I think maybe we should just call it a night. The black clouds, they can give you everything you truly crave. What we all truly crave, girl. If you don't believe us, just continue to stand right there. Wait, aren't you not supposed to stand outside of the circle? But why? All the fun happens within. [speaking gibberish] [cheering] [laughter] Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! [laughter] I can feel. I can feel. I can feel it inside of me. [moaning] [screaming] You must never leave the circle during the ceremony. Ah! You fool, you let it out! [growling] We got to get out of here. We got to get out of here! Get up! [growling] [screaming] [bones snapping] -[moaning] -Get up! Get up! [screaming] That fucking hurts. Stop doing it! [screaming] [screaming] [growling] [growling painfully] [banging shut] [sobbing] [banging door] [growling] Apparently, it was quite the bloodbath. Amazingly enough, young Maggie Black managed to keep that conjured demon-lover trapped in the basement room, hidden, away for years and years. Until the day she... Disappeared. So, she had a pet incubus. That's a first. Well, at some point... All pets come out to play. Wait a second, what's an incubus? They're demons of lust and desire. [Karen] Supposedly, they come to women at night and make love to them while they sleep, ravishing them, sexually. The powerful ones can do it any time, any place, make women explode with pleasure. It's hard to fight what feels good. So, there you go-- Oh! [waitress gasping] I'm sorry, excuse me! I don't know what came over-- Oh! [moaning loudly] [man at table] Are you okay? Yeah! Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Death by passion is the ultimate rush. [moaning] Dessert, anyone? Ah! Ah! [laughing] Wait a second, you didn't tell me Monica told you exactly what happened to Margaret Black. Oh, he didn't. You can safely bet that anyone who thinks they can control a demon is in for a nasty surprise. They don't make good slaves. Not even sex slaves? Humans are better equipped for that. Specially in death. Just think, maybe Maggie Black is its slave for all eternity. [laughing] You had me going there for a second. I actually thought you knew Maggie was dead and walled up in our basement or something. Yeah, it's... [chuckling] It's very 'Edgar Allan Poe' of you. I'm sure I'll have very pleasant dreams tonight after that story. It'll be a nice tale to tell our children. Right. "Hey kids, the Gateway to Hell is in our basement, "so go get some sleep." All right, I got some extra towels for you here, temperature should be okay, but, if you need some blankets or something, they're in the closet, all right? -Anything else you need? -Yeah. You can tell me what the fuck is up with Paul. Okay, just drop it, all right? You can't tell me you didn't notice. [Jennifer] Please. [Karen] Those weird remarks at the bartender, staring at the waitress' ass all evening, while flirting with her right in front of you. [Jennifer] Yes, I saw it. I get it. I'm gonna handle it. All right? We've just been having some issues since we moved into this house. [door creaks] [thud] [whispering] [woman moaning] [eerie, erotic music playing] [screams] Do you think he's having an affair? No! I mean, everything's been fine. It's just, we've been having some timing issues, that's all. So, are we talking, like, premature? [Jennifer] No! Maybe. Look, he wants it and I'm not ready, and then I want to and he's not into it. I don't know. You know what, I feel really uncomfortable talking to you about this. Hey, sis? If you haven't noticed, I'm all grown up. Paul sure has. And what's up with this sudden interest in the occult? I have no idea. I don't know. Maybe he's just trying to show off, or something. Hello, girls. Is this a private party or can anyone join? No party. Karen was just going to sleep, and so are we. Goodnight. Goodnight, Karen. [Karen] Night. Ugh, creeper! You sure you don't want to invite little sis in to join us? The three of us could have a really wild night. That's not funny, Paul. Don't talk about Karen like that. Not even joking. I'm not joking. She's pretty hot. I especially like her black lipstick. Good, it'll match the black eye I'm about to give you. Touchy, touchy. -Touchy-- -Don't even think about it. If your goal tonight was to make me jealous, you failed miserably. I'm fucking pissed off. As long as fucking is in the equation. Are you insane? You actually think I'm gonna have sex with you after the way you behaved tonight? What do you mean? I was on my best behavior. Karen saw what you were doing. And do you think I'm blind? Oh, God! I know you've been wanting it ever since we moved in here. If you think that bath last night, and washing machine ride felt good, just wait until you experience the real me in all of my glory. You see, I made certain improvements to this body... That I think you'll really like. Find somewhere else to sleep, asshole. If I'm downstairs, how am I going to screw your brains out? Oh, wow. Although I have my ways. Goodnight, Paul. You're actually kicking me out? Exactly what did Karen say to you? We'll talk about it tomorrow. Hopefully, you'll come to your senses by then. You don't know what you're missing. Yes, I do. But I'll live. Doubtful. Good. You're still awake. Can I help you with something, Paul? Actually, you can. And I think I might be able to help you, as well. [laughs] You see, her loss is your gain. Wow. Now I see what Jenny sees in you. Deformity. The door's that way, elephant man. Maybe I won't mention this incredible lack of judgment to Jenny. You know, for someone who's so into demons and devils, I'm surprised you never considered how it would feel. How would what feel? For him to get into you. [dramatic music playing] Fuck! Jenny! Help! What's going on? Oh, my god. Jenny, help! Somebody help me! [screaming] [echoing] You should not have interfered. [gasping] You like it gentle or rough? Fuck you! [spits] [echoing] My thoughts exactly. [screaming] [screaming] [laughing] [panting] Karen? [knock] Paul? Where's Karen? Good morning, Jennifer. She came and went. Had a nine o'clock class. Didn't wanna wake you. She said she'd call in a few days. Couldn't even stay for breakfast. Want some? No, thanks. Jennifer, I'm so sorry about last night. You were right. I was way out of line. I promise to make it up to you... If you let me. Yeah, sure. The eggs are almost done. Could you make sure they don't burn? I'm gonna run upstairs. I think I need a shower. [low moan] Now that Karen's gone, nothing's gonna come between us. [exhales] [doorbell rings] Karen? No, ma'am. I'm Leo, with Flow Plumbers. -Right. -I received a call the other day. Of course, yes. My husband called you. Come on in. Thank you. Something about the water pipes and a washing machine. Well, I'm dying out. Right this way, in the basement. Let's take a look at the little monster. Oh, you're out. Great! Where are you going? I got to go to the store. We just got a huge shipment of books. I thought we were gonna have a little fun time. [laughing softly] We will, when I get back and the plumber's gone. I promise you, we will have tons of make-up time. When's the plumber coming? He's here already. You called him, remember? If he needs anything, you'll take care of him, right? Yes, I will take care of him. Okay. See you tonight. [eerie music playing] [whistle] [thud] [laughing] Hello? Somebody out there? Mr. Hemdale? Ah, there's nobody out there. [Karen] Hi, there. Hi. [clears throat] Uh, I didn't know anyone else was down here. I'm the plumber, Leo. I just came to fix the-- [moaning] [clears throat] washing machine. [moaning] Holy shit! Wha... Hi. Look, it's not that I don't appreciate the offer, but-- Mm-hm? Oh! [whispers] I need you inside of me. Who are you? -[unzips pant] -[moans] Okay, wait. Stop, okay? -Wait, just wait. -[laughing] Look, I said... Oh, Jesus! [gasping] I'm definitely getting fired. [groaning] Come on! You're so fucking hot! No one's ever going to believe this! No one will ever find out. [screams] Get off me! [smashing] [screaming] [Karen moaning] [panting] [Paul] Give me his keys. I need to move his car. [Karen giggling] And now, take him inside. She needs nourishment. It's coming soon. [whispers] You did well, Karen. [moaning] [giggling] Paul! Hey. [panting] Hey, what happened? I missed you this morning. [panting] I had an issue with the plumber. Hey, what happened with you and Jen? Everything is in order now. [laughs] See, I told you! Hey, maybe you can help me with Stacey. I mean, she's making me work out twice a day now, until I lose some more weight. Maybe you should try working out in the bedroom. It's a lot more fun. That's exactly what I said, but that's a no-go. Because, she said no sexy-sexy, until you lose at least 10 or 20 pounds. And I'm like, "Well, fuck you very much, then." -Really? -Yeah. Well, not fuck you, as the case may be. Maybe you should bring her by the house tonight. What's going on tonight? House warming? Something like that. It would be a celebration. Celebrations are joyous. [laughs] [phone ringing] [phone recording] Hey. It's Karen. Leave a message. Or don't. Beep. Karen, hey, it's me. Listen, call me back when you get this. I wanna... I wanna talk to you more about Paul. I had the most horrible dream last night, and I... Just call me when you get this, okay? I should restock these. Hi. [gasping] -Oh, shit. I'm sorry. -I'm sorry. -You okay? -Yeah. It was my fault. -All right, don't worry. I got it covered. -Sorry, yeah. [screams] Are you Mrs. Hemdale? Yes. Yes, can I help you? No. But I think I can help you. You're living in the house, aren't you? I'm sorry, who are you? The only survivor. [gasping] The accident with the furnace. You're the girl. It was no accident. There's something evil living in that house. Have you been in the cellar? Have you seen the Black Room? Leave! Take your husband and get out! It'll try to seduce you, trick you with pleasure, make you want more. It feeds off human desires. But, if you're not careful, it will literally eat you alive. I've been in the basement. It's a little creepy but-- You don't understand. My grandmother... Did not disappear, like they say. She was swallowed up by that house. She died saving my life, trying to trap the evil that was summoned decades earlier. Get out, before it takes you, too! Body and soul. Wait... [gasping] [car door shuts] Paul? Paul, are you upstairs? [Jennifer] Paul? [Jennifer] Paul? [Jennifer] Paul? [Jennifer] Paul? -[screams] -Jennifer? Right. You almost scared me to death! Oh, what would be the fun in that? What are you doing down here? I was looking for you. What's in there? I don't know. I can't find the key. You sure you haven't been in there? I could have sworn I heard the door slam. Try for yourself. [door rattles] [door rattles] -Weird. -Mm. You know what, I'm gonna call Monica, the realtor. Let's see if she's got a key. Hey! I have a surprise for you. A couple of surprises, actually. I was paid a visit, today... By the girl who's family sold us this house. The one who was burned. Dawn Black. Yeah, how do you know her name? Oh... Monica must have mentioned her to me. What did she say? -Monica? -No, Dawn. She said this house is evil. And that people have died here, and that we should move, now! -That's ridiculous. -Is it? You've been acting like an asshole ever since we moved in. Maybe this house has infected you. Look, I've been doing some research today at the store, and I found this book. Do you know what these Celtic symbols mean? And then, Karen, she gave me this last night... [shouting] Get that thing away from me! Paul! Are you really going to listen to the advice of some 20-year-old twit? Of course, she hates this place. She nearly died here. You think her memories are going to be all puppy dogs and happy rainbows, Jennifer? She said something about a room in the basement. A black room, maybe that's it. Jennifer, Jennifer... Listen to me. I didn't mean to raise my voice, but... The girl went through a traumatic experience. She lost her grandmother. She nearly lost her face, she's probably not thinking too clearly. And what about all that family history you so graciously spewed out at dinner last night? Rumors. Just rumors, probably started by that silly girl, Dawn Black. Maybe so, but I'm gonna find out what's behind that door. Who are you calling? I told you, Monica, the realtor. I wanna see if she's got a key. [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [dramatic music playing] Hello? Hello? Hello? Goodbye. Oh, Bob, Margo, you're nice and late. What's wrong? Phone died. I will add telephone repairman to the menu. I'll just call her on this. [doorbell rings] Who's that? Might be Satan. Better not let him in. [knocking on door] -Howard, Stacey... -Hey. What are you doing here? We're here for your housewarming party. Surprise! As far as I know, she was the previous owner. She's really pretty. So, who else did you invite, honey? I invited Karen, and the plumber and the electrician. Who knows? They may all pop up later. This is a marvelous house, and at that price? You two made out like bandits. -Mm. -Can I get the tour? Just this way. It's really good cheese. You boys be good now. Oh, that's asking a lot, Stacey. [laughs] I think you've had enough. All he ever does is eat, eat, eat. Howard, I have something I'd like to show you. -This way. -What is it? Oh, trust me, it's to die for. What re you hiding down here? Is it like a torture dungeon? -Close. Very close. -Did you guys get a sex wing? [whistle] After you. Whoa, this better be good. Fifty Shades of Black good. All's dark in here. Okay, Paul, what am I supposed to do? Oh, my God! What the hell is this-- [dramatic music playing] [growling] That's exactly what it is. Last but not least, the master bedroom. Oh, wow! This is simply lovely. I'm sure you get a good night's sleep on this. Well, yeah, unfortunately, that's about all I get. You're lucky. I'm thinking of getting Howard neutered. I mean, it would make everything a whole lot easier for me. What's the big deal with sex, anyway? I've always thought it's totally overrated. -Oh, great, it's working. -What? Oh, my phone was out, earlier. Stacey, would you mind if I made a really quick call and I just meet you downstairs in a couple of minutes? Of course. I'll just go see what my fat husband is stuffing himself with now. [laughing] Thanks so much for coming. Maybe next time. [phone ringing] Bullshit... Hello? Monica, hi, this is Jennifer Hemdale. I had a couple of questions that I wanted to ask about the house. Is now a good time? No, no problem at all. I'm used to a 14-hour day. [Stacey] Um, hello? Where's everybody? What is this? Hide and seek? [gasping] [whispering] [moaning] Oh! [exhales] Um, the lights are out. Um, hello? -Is somebody-- -[door slams shut] Hello? Who's there? [dramatic music playing] That's not funny, Paul. That's just why I'm not laughing. I'm sorry. Our fuse blew. Yeah, I kinda figured that. -Mm-hm. -Where's Howard? He's in the basement, helping me fix it. We could use you, too. -Me? -Mm-hm. To hold the flashlight? It's this way. I'll help you go down. Come. So, Howard tells me you're a frigid little bitch. -What? -Which is a shame... It looks like you have a killer body under those clothes. You know? Let's have a look-see, shall we? [ripping] Oh! [screaming] Yes. Not bad. Not bad at all. Prepare her. [whispering] [door slams] Why are all the lights out down there? Paul? Stacey? Howard? Just me, hon. The downstairs breaker blew out. I guess we should have checked the fine print before we got this place, huh? Yeah. When they leave, we need to talk. Oh, they're already gone. It's just you and me now. What happened? You know Howard and Stacey. It got pretty messy. Did they get into a fight? You can say that. Neither of them won. You find that amusing? Listen, Paul, I just got off the phone with Monica. You did? I see. [sighing] Did she go and ruin my surprise? I don't know what you're talking about. Let me guess. She probably told you that she never mentioned Dawn Black to me by name. And that she didn't know anything about the history of this house, or... Maggie Black's tampering with the occult, or... The incubus. As a matter of fact, that's exactly what she said. Now you're wondering how I knew all those things. Was there any truth to what that burnt up bitch told you this afternoon. Paul. I bet you really want to know what's inside that black room in the basement, don't you? Paul, you're starting to scare me. Well then, come downstairs and see what I've been working on for the past two and a half years. [laughing] I don't understand what's gotten into you. [laughing] Paul? Paul? Paul, tell me what's going on. [creaking] [thud] [mysterious music playing] Paul, stop screwing around. Come on. [eerie music playing] [heart thumping] [Jennifer] What? Oh, my God! -[Paul] Do you like it? -[screams] Congratulations. We are going to have a baby. -Paul? -No, sorry. [echoing] Guess again. [screaming] Oh, my God! Welcome to the womb of the house. You're just in time to help with the delivery. Oh, Karen! Oh, my God! Oh, Karen! They are all serving a purpose, Jennifer. Sebastian Titan set the ball in motion when he conjured me to seduce young, lovely Maggie Black. Oh, she tried to trap me. Didn't you? Yes, you did! Of course, never realizing that I had plans of my own. You see, demons from my dimension have special powers. But there are limits, and boundaries that cannot be crossed. That is unless, of course, the line between our world and yours can be broken down. In order to do this, a new breed must be created. [sighing] Human on the outside. [echoing] Demon within. [crying] You killed Paul, you bastard. You killed him! You see, I needed a host body to plant the final seed. And Paul provided that. In order to be truly immortal... No, no... One has to be reborn. And nourishment is required to build strength. Feeding off your sexual energy has been very productive. [thud] Others require rougher treatment. [growling] [screaming] Where am I? What's going on? Stacey? -Oh, my god. -What the hell is this? I'm gonna help you. I'm gonna help you. Get it off! Oh, no, Jennifer. Don't play with the food. [Paul] You know, I expect this one to be an especially tasty meal. Repressed sexual energy is a very potent source. It can just be sucked out. [Jennifer crying] [screaming] [sucking] [groaning] Oh, oh no! Oh! [screaming] It's finally time. Now, I must join the party. [grunting] [screaming] [echoing] When I am reborn, you will be the first to feed me. [echoing] My new form will be magnificent. Jennifer, now! This is your only chance. Save him! Pull, pull, pull. Fight it. Fight it. Fight it. Fight it. I won't let you have him! Fight it! Harder! [screaming] [groaning] [panting] Oh, my God! -Jen? Jen, what happened? -I lost you. Oh, my... Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Jennifer. [fast paced music playing] [bubbling] That doesn't look good. Get up! It's starting to give birth. You've gotta get out of here, now! What are you doing? When one's in labor, you have to push, hard! [thudding] [crying] [Paul] Over here. -A knife? -It's better than nothing. [Paul] Run! Go, go! -No! -Door's locked. Don't look! -Oh, my God. -Don't look at it. -Don't look at it! -It's not "it." It's a "her." [eerie music playing] [echoing] Neither men nor women will be able to resist me now. [echoing] Feel my power. [gasping] [echoing] I bring worlds to their knees with desire, and feed on their souls. [echoing] When it feels this good, [moaning] [echoing] who can possibly resist? Me! [panting] "Human on the outside," you said. The only flaw in your plan is that humans can be killed easily. [Paul] Jen, Jen! Back to the drawing board, bitch. [screaming] [crickets chirping] You think we can get our old apartment back? [laughing] [engine revving] So, I know it's been a while, but I'm still feeling the effects of that house. [Paul] [water flowing] Yeah, me too. Well, maybe tonight we can do something about it, now that everything's back to normal. I meant to tell you, we may have a problem. Not everything's back to normal. It did that to you? I think I can handle it. [moaning] Let's make a baby. [low growling] [fast paced music playing] [birds chirping] Trust me, you've made the right decision. You two are gonna be so... [sighing] Just so happy here.
