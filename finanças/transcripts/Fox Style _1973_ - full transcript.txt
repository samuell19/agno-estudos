Got kicked out of the rooming house. - How far'd you get? - Oh, 4,500 and some odd. Don't matter though, the engine's shot and the cable's so damn frayed we was lucky to get the tool out last night. - How about credit? - None. Cash on the barrelhead. How much you got left? - None.

[mysterious music] - Hey John! - How you doing Snuffy? - Ain't doing too much lately, man. - I imagine not or you wouldn't be selling shit in my club. - What? Hey what you saying man? - Put it on the counter. - Hey look Pickett I ain't that stupid man. All right. I got a little. It's just for myself, you know. - Right, take it out. Where's your friend? - Oh he went on down the street. We just ran into each other. Oh man. - Give me the money. - What? - Give me the money. - Oh now wait a minute Pickett! - Put the money on the counter. - That's it. [upbeat funky music] [people shouting] - Now you have five minutes to get back across the river. - This is it, huh? [spits] This is what you want, huh, this is what you want? Okay I'll tell you what- - No I'll tell you what. If I catch either one of you in my club again you better be wearing a Sherman's tank. Straight? [groovy music] - Anybody you saw talking to Snuffy get the and give 'em their money back. - He stopped at five tables that I know of. I tried to watch him but- - I know, it's a busy night. Just tell 'em we're very sorry but there'll be no dealing in this club. We got too much invested to get busted on account of some punk like Snuffy. - Okay, I'll try to keep a closer eye on things. - Thanks man. Yeah this is okay this layout. Is this for December? - Mm hmm. - That's in bad taste, this illustration. - AJ, we got a fire downstairs. [exciting music] - That's gonna blister bad, come on. - No, I saw a car coming up the alley as I was going in. I didn't realize it then but now that I think about it it looked like Snuffy's car. Just as I'd gone inside the door they hit it with a bottle of gas or something. - Okay. Frank'll take you to the doctor to get this checked out. - I can't, I got- - You're going home. - I got deliveries coming. - Listen man, Barnes'll take care of it. - But I gotta set up for the new show. - You are going to the doctor and then you're going home. [light music] - Tired honey? - You know it. - Come on, your bath's ready. - There's a lady been calling for you all evening. She says she has to talk to you personally. - Tell her to call tomorrow, I'll talk to her then. - Well that's what I've been telling her. She says it has to be tonight. Says she's calling from somewhere, sounds like Semiole City. - What? No, no babe, that's Seminole City. That ain't no lady, that's my mama. Yeah you better put her on too. - Arthur is that you? - Hello mother how you doing? - Just fine son. How's the nightclub business? - Doing fine, doing fine. - Arthur? - Yeah well Mama look it's awful late right now, maybe... - They're gonna close down the factory and I ain't about to let that happen. - What factory is that? - The overall factory. And we need you to come down here. - Down there? - Yes. - Well Mama I'm awful busy right now, maybe I'll tell you what I'll get Pat there, he'll take care of it first thing in the morning. - I don't need no Pat. You've got lots of money, and folks with lots of money supposed to have lots of time. Now your Uncle Henry's sitting right here. And he says they're gonna sell the factory next Tuesday. They're gonna auction it off. Now, you know about all these things. You're doing so good with your business and everything. Now wait just a minute son, let me do the talking 'cause this call is costing a lot of money. - Okay, okay Mama, go ahead. - I know you're busy, and I wouldn't ask you to come except this factory's all we got. Now are you coming down here and help us? I think it's best if you come tomorrow. - Okay, okay Mama I guess it'll be sometime in the evening. All right. Bye bye. - Everything's gonna be all right. [laughing] - Velma, get ahold of the operator and tell her to charge all those calls from Seminole City to me. Yeah, looks like we're gonna be leaving in the morning so get ahold of Barnes, call Pat and ask him to meet us at the airport. And Velma get all those contracts and crap together, I'll be out there to work on them in a few minutes. And tell John to meet me in the office right now. Yeah okay. Sorry baby. - Yeah. [funky music] - How's Patricia and the kids? - Fat, sassy, rich. You know I miss Mama though. Has she smoothed out any yet? - Not so's you'd notice. - Yeah, I was damn near grown before I realized how much we must have got to her. Remember the time I took you out to that goddamn Suzy's whorehouse? [laughing] Goddamn she was so mad she could have killed us both, Mama. She didn't want her baby sleeping with no slut. White or otherwise. Hey remember when she took out that goddamn broom? [laughing] Goddamn she coulda caught me she'd have killed me. - Sure almost did too. - Oh man. Barnes, could you pull over here at this intersection up here? - What? Where you going? - We're friends to the bitter end, right? Well this ain't gonna be it. So long brother. - Take a right up at the next corner. You get younger every time I see you. - Oh you're teasing. - You do, you look great. - Let me look at you. - Mama, you remember Richard Barnes. - Of course Mr. Barnes, how are you? - Good to see you again. - Grand Rapids? - You remember! - You see, I remember. Come on in. - Here they come now. - They finally got here. - Hello Arthur. - Arthur, you remember your Uncle Henry. - Of course I do. Hello Uncle. - And this here is Little Henry. - How you doing Arthur? Been a long time, ain't it? - He's a little bigger since the last time you seen him. - Yeah, I guess he is. - And this here is Little Henry's wife Renee. They live over in Pomona Springs. - How are you doing Renee? - And this is little William. - Hi William! - Hi. [mumbles] - And this is Amanda. - Hello Amanda. - Hello. - And this here is your Aunt Josephine. - Come on home. - Oh Auntie. - Oh. We are so glad! - This is your first cousin Eloise and this is her son Elliot. - Hey, glad to see you! - Okay. [laughing] - We had to go ahead and eat on account of the children, but you can see I cooked everything that you like. Black eyed peas and greens. - Just fine Mama, just fine. - Would you like some spiced peaches, Mr. Barnes? - Oh yes ma'am. Sure looks good. - Are you a cousin or a niece? - Neither one. - Oh, this is Cindy McDougal. And I think she's one of the smartest girls in Seminole City. She got a college degree and she came back home to teach here. - Well it's nice to meet you, Cindy. - It's a great pleasure to meet you. - This is Richard Barnes. - How are you? - Hello Cindy. - Hey I better make the iced tea, okay? - I'll help you! - No sit down and talk, I'll take care of it. - All right. - Well Mama. Tell me all about it. - Well there ain't much to tell, son. There was 214 people at that factory. And every one of 'em got laid off. - That's right Arthur, every employee is out of work. And that includes just about everybody outside. - Now I know it's gonna be harder than what we think, but that overall company is all we got. It ain't like over in Pomona Springs. They got the parachute factory. - Doing good too, that's what Little Henry tells me. - Oh we doing real good. We supposed to get another contract from the government pretty soon. - What were they planning to do with the factory, just let it stand there? - No, I think the board plans on Mr. Neely buying it at the auction. - Mm hmm, and he owns the bank. - I remember. - Neely says he's going to tear it down, try to sell the land. - And that's why we phoned you. - Good evening everybody. Hope I ain't too late. - Here's Brother Rambo. He came over especially to meet you. - Heard all about your money. - Evening Sister Fox. Brother Henry. Now got here as soon as I could. Is this here your boy? - Yes sir, this is my son Arthur. - It's a privilege and a blessing Brother Fox. I can't tell you how much it means to us having you come down here and help us with our little project. - Well you know how it is brother, when Mama calls- - A good son answers. Yes I know, and the Lord will send down a blessing for your faithfulness. - This is Richard Barnes, Brother Rambo. - A great pleasure, great pleasure Mr. Barnes. - All mine, the pleasure's all mine. - I hope you haven't eaten yet Brother Rambo. - Oh, I just had a snack before I came. - Well you just sit down there and help yourself. [upbeat music] - We'll talk some more later on Brother Fox, I'm sure. Right now you must be tired from your trip. - That's true. I'm on a schedule delay. - All right son. [murmuring] - Can I have some of that spiced peaches Cindy? - I talked to the lawyer today myself, and he's gonna take you through the plant tomorrow. Sit down, son. Now Arthur, I don't want you to feel as though you got to help us. But we've been so keyed up lately that I just don't know what to do. - I wanna talk about something else, Mama. - What? - Why you treat Pat the way you do. Pat drove in with us this evening and he wouldn't even come into this house. - That thing, that's understandable. - Pat's a man, Mama. One of the best. He's also my partner. For a long time he was just like your other son. Whatever we got now we started together because of you. - I don't want to talk about it. - You raised the both of us just like we was one. And when we grew up, when we left home you just crossed him out like he was something from another world. - I raised you because you was mine. I raised him because I had to. When his mama died I took him in because I wasn't about to see no orphan grow up around me. But the minute I took him in trouble started. He started trying to make you white and you trying to make him black. And when you were kids you were cussing and fighting all the time. And when you got bigger you were drinking and whoring around and you're still doing it. Now you both have done good, but you ain't done right. Now maybe I do have to accept it from you 'cause you're mine but I sure don't have to accept it from no Pat Wolf. And that's all I got to say about it. [mellow music] - Car's unpacked. Your stuff's in the front bedroom. - Good. - Say. Something I like to ask you about. - Sure. - Well here about two years ago I seen a copy of that there magazine, you know the Fox Lair? - Yeah, that one. - Yeah, and in this one I seen they had a big thing about you. You know and all them pictures. All about your cars and that airplane and you know the nightclub and the pool and you know where you live. - Right. - Well I been meaning to ask you. Is all that real? - Well the car and the plane, that's just to get around in. You know? - Yeah. - And well the club, that's got to look good, that's the business. - Sho'nuff. Well what about that penthouse apartment of yours? I mean... - They just stuck it in man, they said they'd make it look good. I got a couple little old rooms over the club, that's all. - What about that gal in that bathtub, Arthur? I mean... [chuckling] - No man, hell! I felt stupid as hell getting in there with that woman. But they made me do it, they said it would add style. You know? [laughing] - I don't believe this. - Steady old man. - Afternoon sir. - Hope we're not late. - Reverend Rambo, no sir it's all right, we've only been here a minute ourselves. - Oh that's good, good. - Is this- - AJ Fox. You know, Hattie Fox's boy. - Mr. Fox it's a pleasure sir. I'm Cunningham Calhoun. Heard a lot about you when I was in law school. - Mr. Barnes. - Mr. Barnes, howdy do sir? - Brother Rambo. - Mr. Neely. - Sure. So you know that note's been overdue for a couple of weeks now. - Oh well you know I been kinda busy lately, you know with the collecting and all. We collected $14,445 and just as soon as this plant's back on its feet again I'm gonna pay off that debt. - All right. - Mr. Fox, I'd like to introduce Mr. TH Neely, president of the local bank. - How are you? - Mr. Frankford, manager of the plant. - It's a pleasure to know you Mr. Fox. - This is Mr. Barnes. - How do you do Mr. Barnes? - Mr. Neely. - Mr. Barnes. - Pleasure to know you. - Mr. Calhoun's requested that I show you through the plant. - We appreciate your taking the time. - Oh think nothing of it. I'm always glad to show someone the place. It's quite a historical landmark you know. [light harmonica music] This original building was an arsenal for the Confederate Army, 17th infantry brigade. Commanded by Brigadier General KT Framingham who was the paternal great grandfather of the last owner of the company. If you'll just come in here now, watch your step. Come on through please. The general was owed some amount of money at the conclusion of the war, and as the government in Richmond was in disarray at the time, general settled the matter by taking possession of this building and 2 or 300 bales of cotton that were stored inside. But as the business expanded it became necessary for them to move into the basement. Family made do in these quarters for some 15 years. Til profits from the company made it possible to expand the plant and build a new home nearby. - AJ this is the damndest mess I ever seen. You get into this and you'll have a disaster on your hands. - I got eyes. But look here, if this is all there is what does that little beady eyed little man want with it? - However gentlemen this is the property that'll be on the auction block tomorrow. If there are any questions? - Yes, if I may. Are there any other properties or buildings included in the deal? - Ah well there is the Seminole Hills development acreage outside of town. - Means it's a swamp. - Would you care to see that acreage also sir? - I see. No I don't think that'll be necessary. Thank you very much for showing us through. - Thank you. - Mr. Frankford. - Thank you. - Mr. Neely. Gentlemen. [mellow music] It ain't necessarily so Mama. Probably all he wants to do is tear it down like he said. It wouldn't take much, just stomp your foot and... - Now listen here. It seems to me that you been up north so long that you done forgot what it's like around here. Why them old most bastard brothers see that factory torn down than see any progress made in this town. Because any progress left is black progress. - Well that's exactly my point. It isn't progress to get saddled with an old fire trap like that. - If that's what we got to start with then that's what it'll be, that and spirit. Now it seems to me the way you acted in there that I made a mistake by asking you to come down here. All you could see was a building, and machines. You done got to the point where you don't see people no more. So you just go on back to your nightclub and your oil wells and your women. - Mama. - Just go on. We got our money together. And if you can't add anything but money, we got plenty of that so just go on. - I think I'll stick around and see how you make out. - It's left up to you. [bells tolling] - Do you know them? - The little man is Mr. Neely's brother in law. I don't know who the other man is, I think he's from around Mobile. - Uh huh. - Yeah I saw him in the bank last Friday. - I see. - That's him there. What do you think? - They're bluffing. - Yeah I think so. [murmuring] - Say Arthur. I got you a seat saved up here. - I think we can see better if we sit back there. - Oh. How you doing? - Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention for a moment please? At this time we stand ready to receive the first bid. Mr. Washington. - Mr. Calhoun. We bid $10,000. [cheering] - $10,000 is the bid. - Mr. Calhoun. - Mr. Neely. - Wish to bid $14,500. - $14,500 is the bid. Do I hear further bids? - 15,000. [murmuring] - 18,000. - $18,000 is bid. - $20,000. [audience applauding] [audience cheering] - You gonna save the day, right? - That's right. - Further bids please. - $25,000. - $25,000 is bid. - 27,500. - Do I hear further bids? - Do you know what you're doing? - Damn sure ain't what they want me to do. - $35,000. - $35,000 is bid. Further bids please. - 50,000. - Mr. Calhoun. - Mr. Neely. - The First State Bank of Seminole City bids $100,000. - $100,000. - Thurmond Neely, have you lost your mind? - Shut up, let me be! - $100,000 is bid. Do I hear further bids? - 125. - Sir? - $125,000. [clears throat] - $125,000 is bid, ladies and gentlemen. Do I hear further bids? - Mr. Calhoun. - Mr. Neely. - I want to request a recess. - Mr. Calhoun? - Yes. - My bid is $125,000. Will that bid be honored or not? - Yes sir it is honored, be assured. - Damnit I gotta call Mobile! - Well Mr. Neely, I just don't see how an auction may be recessed and besides I don't think it'll do too much good to call Mobile. - Get the hell back here! [snickering] Mr. Calhoun. - Yes sir. - We still gotta recess. How do we know whether that man's bid is good or not? - We've already considered the need for verification of our bid sir. We have something here that might solve this matter very quickly. These are letters of credit from the three largest banks in New York. Any one of them is enough to cover this bid. - Anybody can write a letter, sign it. It don't mean a thing. - That's true, it's only paper Mr. Neely. So is this. [crowd murmuring] - Uh, gentlemen. I think we should proceed. For the sum of $125,000. Going once. Going twice. Sold! [bangs gavel] [cheering] [shouting] [upbeat music] - Brothers and sisters. This is truly a great day. A great day I tell you. - Yes sir! - And bears one more witness to the fact that the Lord do provide. Do you understand what I'm talking about? - Yes sir! - Do you hear me? - Yeah! - Say amen! - Amen! - Say it again! - Amen! - All right. - Uncle Henry? - Yeah? - Let's go look around that swamp this afternoon. - Well I can take you. I know my way around there as well as anybody. [mysterious music] That was so fine. Mr. Calhoun. Bank of Seminole City wishes to bid $100,000. Uh, 125. I never saw anything get to old Neely like that or his old wife either. - Yeah it didn't look like I did what they wanted me to do huh? Whatever it is they thought they had must be in here somewhere. Why don't we try up that way, Cindy? - Seems like it's getting shallower to me. - Give me that pole. It's been a long time since I've pushed a skiff around. - What are you going in here for? I never noticed that before. - I betcha somebody else did. - How about that? What is it AJ? - Can't say for sure. Some folks might think it was natural gas. - Really? - Mm hmm. We're burning Cindy! Get up there and put it out. Go on, put it out! - I'm trying! Would you get us out of here before we burn up? - Mr. Fox you looking real cool. - Yeah. Style, baby. - What do you think'll be done with that stuff? You got any plans? - Not yet. Pat's the expert on gas and oil. Course if it's good and there's enough of it. No telling. Wanna go for a swim? - No I think I'll pass on that. [chuckles] [gentle music] How about the factory? - We better face it. There isn't much future in making overalls. - Well not the old way. I mean we've got some surprises in store. We've got some new ideas and we got some different procedures. You'll see. - I didn't say we weren't gonna reopen. Everybody's going back to work. Gonna need every good idea you can come up with. - Well you know what I think? - What's that? - I think you care just as much as anybody about keeping this old town going. - Is that right? - I think there's a lot of things you care about. - Swamp gas? - That's right. You find it all over down here. Seeps up in patches of bubbles. Kinda smells like a goat, don't it? - What do you figure? Do you think they might have known and just used it as a come on to jack up the price? - Nah. If Thurman Neely's anything like we're remembering he wouldn't be that bright. I think he figured he had something else he wouldn't have jacked the price up 100,000. - Could be. - What's that? - Oh the dog. - Well I better get the hell outta here before Mama gets back. What are you figuring on doing about all this? - Think I'll pay a call down at the bank. See if I can sell some real estate. [chuckling] - Well it just wouldn't be possible, don't you see? Now I'm never adverse to such a thing myself, but the directors just wouldn't approve that large a loan for speculation. Now if it were a question of 10, 15,000. - Uh, I'm afraid our project will just have to wait until we recover enough funds. Thank you very much for your time, Mr. Neely. Good luck to you sir. - Thank you, and the same to you. Mr. Fox. - Yes sir? - Tell you I been thinking. Now I can understand don't you see as a business man. Now in all fairness to your situation and in appreciation for what you're doing for the factory and all, I'd like to help you out by a personal offer. Say, $50,000 for that swamp acreage. What do you say? - Well I hadn't considered selling Mr. Neely, but looking at it realistically and knowing the potential value of a gas deposit in that swamp, I'd say $100,000 wasn't just reasonable, it's a steal. - Well. Well why don't we just step inside a minute? [funky music] Let me make a call to Mobile. Sit down, make yourself comfortable. Mary Ellen, could you bring some coffee in please? - Cindy drew this so you could see what we're aiming for. Now we know there's not much market in men's overalls. But we think we got the makings of women's wear. - Mm hmm. - This is the last one, Arthur. - Thanks Uncle. Got something going here Mama. I think you're on the right track. I gotta go. - AJ. Now we've talked about it and we want you to take the money we collected because it just isn't fair to ask you to carry the whole load all by yourself. - You turn it back to the people that contributed, huh? - No, wait a minute now- - Now look. I ain't gonna hear it. - Thank you. - Yeah, next time. - Brother Fox, I do wish you'd stay and worship with us Sunday, I think you'd find it a great blessing. - Arthur done left a great blessing, brother. - Son. I'm so proud of you. Now you take care of yourself, and you write us. - I will Mama. I will. Uncle. We'll keep in touch. - Yeah. - Well. I guess you're looking forward to getting back up there. All those bright lights and fancy clubs. - Hey. - And women. - Look here. - Goodbye Mr. Barnes. - Bye Cindy. - I wanna be in the air by six o'clock. [upbeat funky music] - Oughta catch him [mumbles] right? - Yeah, Putnam's next. - People damn sure stay laughing in front of me. Til I tell you to slow down. Right. There he is! - Yeah? - Keep ahead of him. - He's picking up. - Get in this lane, get in this lane. Slow down, slow down. [gun fires] [jazzy music] - Welcome home. What'd you say your name was? - Arthur J. Fox. The overall king. I wanna see Pickett. - He hasn't gotten here yet. He probably got tied up in the- [dramatic music] [sirens wailing] - Say girl, what you doing later? - Oh, I've got a date. - Oh yeah, who's that? - Oh, this dude says he lives here but he's sure out of town a lot. - AJ. That was Liutenant McGowan on the phone, says we should get over to Putnam and Oak Lawn right away. He's waiting for us there. [dramatic music] [sirens wailing] - AJ it looked like a shotgun blast right through the window. He was probably dead before he even hit that ditch. Seems like there weren't any witnesses. We got a couple ideas so we're gonna stay hot on it. - So have I. [upbeat funky music] - Look out! I know where he's going, we gotta follow him. - Okay hit it. - Put this shit away, AJ's coming up. Come on. Say man ain't nobody ever took off AJ. Why don't you go down then? - Get down to the door. - Oh why don't you go? - He's right in back of us! - Back of me? - Just hold your gun on him. Maybe get him in the ship, blow him away. If he don't... - Just blow him away, that's all there is to it huh? - Hey go on. - That's all it is. Why you wanna set me up? - What's the matter, you yella? - Why don't you go down? - Hey look at your size man. He's just a little dude. - If he's so little why don't you just go down and take him off? - Man, what you get paid for? [door slams] [funky music] [shouting] [scuffling] [sirens wailing] - Wake up, Snuffy. It's Christmas. Snow is falling. Santa Claus is on the way. [police radio chatter] Well I'm a little pressed for time right now Mama. Yeah, that's right, I own Fox's Lair. Oh I don't know, let me make a call and I'll get back to you. Hold on a second. Hey wait a minute. - Sorry baby, I'll see you when you get back. Whenever that is. - Yeah Mama, go ahead. No no, nothing important. Um yeah okay look let me see what I can do about it and I'll get back to you. Okay, bye. Overalls. Velma? Yeah would you get Barnes on the phone? And call Hugo and tell him he's got two weeks to get a promotion campaign together for the new Dixie overall... The new Dixie fashion line. That's right, tell him to coordinate with Uncle Henry. Hmm. We're migrating south. - What do you suppose all that commotion's about over yonder? [murmuring] - Fella told me the black foxes are coming in. - What in the hell is the black foxes? - Oh, that's a basketball team somewhere. [funky music] - How are things doing down here Uncle Henry? - Doing just fine. Everything'll be ready by the morning. - Well that's good. Is everybody placed now? - All except Barney, Cecille, and Barnes. - Does anybody want a glass of lemonade? - I could use a good bed right now. - Well say no more. You can have mine, I'll sleep out on the porch tonight. - The porch? You mean with the bugs and stuff? - Oh come on honey, this is down home. You remember sleeping outside? - Where I grew up might be able to if you were sleeping in a cage. - Mother would you- [shouting] - Ooh I'll get a towel! [slapping] [tapping] - Miss Blair? - Yes? - Sounds like you're having a little trouble sleeping. - Not really. It's these mosquitoes that have got insomnia. - Oh I got just the thing for that. Wait just one minute. [light music] [knocking] Miss Blair? - Just a second. - Got something for the mosquitoes and a little something to help you sleep. - Oh well thank you. - Lemonade. Imagine it's been a long time since you had any country style lemonade. [coughing] - You could say that again. What'd you put in this? - Just a little medicinal gin. I find it relaxing after a hard day. - More like medicinal battery acid. What's this? - Citronella, that's to keep the mosquitoes off. - And everything else too. - Oh, you hardly notice the smell at all once it's on. Here let me show you. You see? - Yeah, hardly at all. - Oh it'll soak in in just a minute. Now Miss Blair, I don't want you to get the wrong impression. - I never get the wrong impression. Goodnight. Brother Rambo. - Yes? - I appreciate the lemonade. - Oh, think nothing of it. - Right. [people chattering] - We'll do with the best sent. - Okay Mama, hold on a second. Say man, got it together? - Oh everything's fine. You know I'm really amazed. Two weeks of setup and it's actually organized. - All it takes is spirit. - I guess so. Yeah, excuse me for a minute. Cindy. - Hi. - Hi. Those are for the showing, aren't they? - That's right. - You're gonna be one of the models? - Yeah they insisted on it. I was up half the night memorizing my speech. - You'll do fine. It's fun once you get into it. - Well I hope so. - I'll see you later. - Bye bye. - Uh, Bonnie? - Mm hmm? - Maybe I shouldn't ask. But what in the hell is that perfume you got on? - Eau de citronella. Local product. May be your turn for a free sample tonight. [funky music] - Hattie, telephone! - All right. Honey, will you take these clothes to Uncle Henry and tell him that they're for the show this afternoon? - Mm hmm. - All right? Okay, I'm coming. - Tired honey? - Got me changing clothes so much my skin's about worn through. - You upset about something? - Yes I am. - About the factory and all? - That's right. - Well I been meaning to have a say about that. Maybe we oughta have a little talk. - Yeah well maybe so. - You know I'm becoming more and more disturbed about the attitude of certain people around here and if I ever... ♪ Gotta get down down down down ♪ ♪ Way down [audience applauding] [scat singing] [audience applauding] - May I have your attention? Has everybody had a good time? - [Crowd] Yeah! - Did everybody get enough to eat? - [Crowd] Yeah! - Good, good. Well in addition to good food and good music, we've seen some pretty women. - Right on. - Right on. - And some beautiful clothes. - Yeah! - You really laid 'em out. - Yeah. Most of 'em ain't seen this much woman since they read the National Geographic. Some crowd. Did you see that old dude about to beat his hands off? His old lady jumping on his ass? - You think this is gonna start something? - Hell no. It's just another waste of time. I'm ready to get back to civilization. I've had it with hick towns and ignorant rubes and horny preachers. [laughing] - We'll be sending you regular reports. - Mama have you given any more thought to letting me get you a place in the city? - Oh, I think we're needed right here. - Whatever you say. All right Uncle, don't let her work too hard now. - I won't. - Take care son. - Bye. - So now we're out 100,000 on your say so, and another 25,000 for the drilling on your say so. And you didn't even have a sample tested to start with. - Well it smelled awful gassy. - Not only that, you practically gave the damn factory to him. Now how do you think that's gonna set with 'em when they hear about that down in Mobile? You let yourself get took, just bald as hell. Now what do you got to say for it? - Well I figured it could be that rich, but damnit who ever heard of one that smart? - I'll be goddamned. [machines whirring] [murmuring] - Man it sure is hot this time of year. - It sure is. - I don't know what we gonna do. - Hey Cindy. - Cindy, come here! Why don't you tell them we need some air conditioner around here? - I'm liable to tell them a lot more than that. - Oh hey. - You take that on a man. - I'm telling you. - Now you done seen all these naked women 'round here. Puttin' evil thoughts into the minds of god fearing people. - You right sir. - And you know about the sweatshop factory! - Yes sir. - Yes. - And I just think that this ain't god's way. - You right. - Do you know what I'm talking about? [cheering] Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you? - Rambo is getting awful agitated here lately. - I guess with most folks working every night they too tired to go to revival meetings. - Yeah that means old collection plate is getting lighter and lighter and lighter. [laughing] - Listen kids, I hate to break up your love affair but come on, let's go back to work. - Good morning. - Morning Cindy. Have you taken care of all the new employees? - Yeah. - What's the matter baby? - Nothing. - There's gotta be something the matter the way you actin'. - Nothing's the matter with me. Well I been thinking about going back to teaching school is all. - Well. If that's what you want to do, but we sure need you here. You're the best personnel manager we can get. - Or money can buy as Arthur J. Fox would say. - Now what do you mean by that? - I mean this whole thing has gotten to be just another rip off, that's what. - Oh honey. You can't believe that. After all we've been through? - We're turning into a bunch of exporters down here serving the interests of an absentee black capitalist? Exploiting black labor? We're no better than old man Framingham. - Now what's the matter with her? - Nothing's the matter with me. I'm just the only one that hasn't let it go to my head. I don't feel that well, I need a couple of days off. - Yeah now, what's going on? - Brother, there will be no more work performed in this factory until this matter is brought to a head. - What matter is that? - Y'all come on in here. - Cindy, come in here. - Now we've been elected to represent the rest of the workers in this here plant. Now the matter is cleaner and more sanitary places to perform the work. Less safety hazards. More air conditioning and better pay. Less working overtime. Paid sick leave. And time off for attending religious services. Profit sharing plan! And a 10% tithe to some deserving organization or religious organization. Now. [light music] [phone ringing] - Hello? - Mr. Fox? This is Frankford down at the factory. I thought you oughta know we got a real emergency down here right now. It's Brother Rambo, he's in the plant and he's stirring up the employees about everything. Yeah. - Yeah well I figured that might happen. [sighs] Don't worry, just keep calm. Okay. - Even if it means less profit for that absentee holder of this company, who I might add refused to let us buy into our own factory after we had worked so hard to collect the money. - That is a great sermon brother. Would have been even better if you had known what you were talking about. - Brother, nobody knows better than me when my people are being treated unfairly. - Baloney! Your people? Your people hell! - Now you listen here- - Now hold on there. Let's go about this thing sensibly. Now this matter of absentee ownership. - Yes, where is he? I mean Mr. AJ Fox. He's taking life easy while we're down here sweating out money for him. - Arthur doesn't make any money from this company. And never did. - Just what do you mean? That don't make no sense to me. - Let me finish! - He gets no money? - No honey, he doesn't. - Well who does? - We do. - Now let me ask you something. Is there anything in writing regarding this matter? - Yes there is. [funky music] Profits from said company shall be directed at first toward an educational scholarship for deserving children of the black community. And at such time as further profits allow there shall be established within the township of Seminole City a four year liberal arts college. The precise location of which shall be determined by the trustees of the foundation. You might want to check this over Reverend to see if I read it correctly. Now the foundation mentioned is strictly non-profit, chartered by the state. And since Mr. Fox owns no businesses in the state, he doesn't even get a tax write-off. - Now you hold on there just a minute. Ain't you trying to get past something? Now just who are these trustees? - Tell him who they are. - Oh, it's right here. The following individuals have been designated as trustees for the foundation. Mrs. Hattie Fox. Mr. Henry David Washington. Mr. Ernest Frankford. Mr. Cunningham Calhoun. Miss Cindy McDougal. And the Reverend Everett L. Rambo. If we could have the last three signatures please. - Excuse me. - If it's all right with you brother we going back to work. - Here's a pen brother, sign it. - I never thought I'd see the day that I would be glad to see you. - Well I was half expecting you to throw one of your hissy fits like the last time we saw each other. [laughing] But AJ was so damn insistent that I come over I thought I'd better take the chance. I'm glad I did, Mama. - Arthur told me that you got married. - Yes ma'am. I got a fine wife, and two kids nearly grown. - Should give Arthur a push, he's still dangling. [laughing] - Well, don't you think it's about time that you should bring 'em around and let me see what they look like? - Yes ma'am. Bye Mama. Uncle Henry. Let's go Simmons. - Did you see that chauffer? - Looked mighty fine. - I don't see why he couldn't give that job to some nice colored fella. - Oh mama. - Mm? - Yeah. - How's your girlfriend? - Who, Bonnie? - I don't recall her name. [chuckles] - Well Bonnie's out on the coast now. Got herself a motion picture contract. She probably got half of Hollywood up a tree by now. So what happened to Rambo's old tent? - He folded and gone. He said something about the lord's hand leading him into greener pastures. He's been gone almost a month now. You haven't said what this secret mission is all about. - What's that? - All the mystery. Mama asking me to pick you up from the airport? - Oh when Frankford telephoned me I called Mama. I thought I'd better come down here and see how the problems at the factory were being worked out. When I landed, there you were. And here we are. - Disappointed? - No, pleased actually. This is much nicer than the factory. - Would you like some black eyed peas? - I would like some of everything. Thank you. Cindy, why did you bring me here? - Well any woman knows the first thing a man needs is feeding. I mean the factory is there and it'll be all right now. - This is good. - And this is not the Sunday special. - Go ahead. - You know sometimes you amaze me. - How's that? - Well most of the time you're so cool and businesslike and other times. - Other times what? - Other times Mr. Fox you are easy. - Cindy how'd you like to try the city with me first thing in the morning? For a while? - When I move, and if I move, my man is gonna be mine. [rotary phone dialing] - Barnes. Yeah. Um, I'm gonna be staying down here for a while. Well look I mean the factory's gonna be needing, you know, more attention than I thought and there's some other things too. Of course I mean it. It looks like you got yourself a man. I thought you were supposed to feed me first. Now don't this beat a damn stinking swamp? - Mm hmm. - All the crawdads watching. - Mm. [sultry music] [phone ringing] - Yeah? - Arthur? Is that you? Arthur? Now listen to me son. Little Henry's here. They got trouble over in Pomona Springs. Arthur? Do you know anything about parachutes?
