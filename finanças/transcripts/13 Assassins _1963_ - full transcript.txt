THE THIRTEEN ASSASSINS Planning by: JUNICHIRO TAMAKI, KANJI AMAO Screenplay by: KANEO IKEGAMI Cast CHIEZO KATAOKA KOTARO SATOMI, RYOHEI UCHIDA, TRTSURO TANBA SATOMI OKA, YURIKO MISHIMA, JUNKO FUJI KANJURO ARASHI, KO NISHIMURA, RYUNOSUKE TSUKIGATA Directed by: EIICHI KUDO It was in the early morning of September 5th in the first year of Koka (1844)... ...in front of the estate of senior advisor Sir Doi Oi-no-kami, outside of Edo Castle's Babasaki Gate... ...that chief retainer Zusho Mamiya, a subject of... ...Sir Naritsugu Matsudaira Sahyoe-no-kami of 100,000-koku in Banshu Akashi, committed seppuku. Being that Sir Naritsugu Matsudaira Sahyoe-no-kami was... ...the younger brother of the then seated Shogun, this scandal shocked government officials. No use talking about it, but Sir Naritsugu was born with an unsophisticated personality. Inconsiderate to his family's status, not only is he arrogant... ...but also has an unparalleled love of women and sex. I hear farmers' uprisings repeatedly occur in his home territory of Akashi. I also heard that last year on his way to Edo for his annual tour of duty... ...he was involved in a scandalous incident on Kiso Highway in Owari Castle's territory. Just so that such an incident wouldn 't happen... ...we changed the route for his entourage to Nakasendo Highway... ...but it seems as if that had a reverse effect. His Highness orders that we do everything we can to settle this matter quietly. Although born from different mothers... ...it is natural that he gives special consideration to his own brother under his hire. It is the fault of the then cabinet of senior advisors... ...who sent Sir Naritsugu as an adopted son to the Matsudairas of Akashi. It appears that Zusho Mamiya committed harakiri... ...to appeal to the Central Gov't to take an appropriate measure. I know. His Highness is the ruling justice of the country, noble by Heaven's will. It's pointless to argue over it any more. The corpse of Zusho shall remain on the estate of Sir Oi-no-kami for the initial period of mourning. May I report, the Government Inspector Sir Shinzaemon Shimada is here, summoned by you. So Shinza is here. I hope it wasn 't inconvenient that I asked you to come so late. I 've been a widow for many years, so I have few obligations at home. Hmm. By the way... Yes? You've heard about the incident, haven 't you? You want to take a look at his letter of appeal? It's no use reading it at this point. I understand the cabinet has decided on how to handle the matter. By the way, what do you think of Sir Naritsugu? Yes... I feel he may not be worthy of the historic Matsudaira family. Since you understand that, there's something I need to tell you. Choose men from Hatamoto class samurai within the next three days. Sift through them and select the ones you set your mind on. Advisor. My understanding is a man 's life weighs more than anything and is irreplaceable. Sir Naritsugu is a human being, too. Before you tell me to do that... ...why not ask him to retire by a unanimous request from the Central Gov't? That was Mamiya's plea at the cost of his own life. But it isn't possible. How come? His Highness already appointed Sir Naritsugu as a senior advisor upon his departure from Edo. You mean he would let him take care of politics? That's why... ...we need to figure out a way to correct the distortion of this injustice. Incidentally, I've invited someone here whom I want you to meet. Could you meet with him? Yes. I'm Yukie Makino, a retainer of Sir Owari Chunagon servng at Agematsu Mansion in Kiso. I'm Shinzaemon Shimada. Let's hear what you have to say. Yes. Then, let me explain in a logical manner. Last October when Sir Naritsugu Matsudaira of Akashi was... ...on his annual journey to Edo via Nakasendo Highway, he stayed overnight at Agematsu, Kiso. To make sure there will be no chance of making a mistake... ...samurai of the Owari family servng at the Mansion received him with hospitality... ...bringing in even their wives and daughters. Uneme! Father. Did you retrieve the picture scroll we showed him for his entertainment? I forgot. Right away. Tell Chise to do it. Yes. Chise! What is it? Chise was the wife my son had married two months earlier. I thought it was too petty a job to bother my son with... ...so I ordered her to do it, and that invited the tragedy. Where are you from? Yes, I belong to the family of Uneme Makino at Owari Mansion. You're too pretty to be left alone in the mountains of Kiso. Please no playing! Please let me go! Please let me go! Please don't! Please don't! Chise! Chise! Trespasser! Hold it! Chise... What have you done, Chise? What have you done? What have you done, Chise? During the same night, Chise killed herself. Without saying a word of any kind, the entourage of the Akashi clan departed. After Naritsugu arrived in Edo... ...the Owari clan made numerous attempts to protest to him, but received no response. For me, having lost my son and his wife in tragic deaths... ...I feel I no longer have any purpose to live on for. I 've considered committing harakiri to end it all. However, when I think about the shame my lord Sir Owari Chunagon has been put through... ... I, as a living witness, don't feel free to do so, thus extending this life I no longer care for. Please laugh at me as a grumbling old man. They were a better son and a better daughter-in-law than I deserved. What do you think, Shinza? I feel as though I can hear the voice of Zusho Mamiya while sitting here. Anyway, even as the cabinet who forms the ruling justice of the country... ... there are things we can do and things we can 't. To betray the word of His Highness and find fault with his political leadership... ...that's something I, a senior advisor, cannot do. But if we don't, the country's politics will be chaotic and the harm will befall on all peoples. What do you say? It's a good place for a samurai to die. Would you be willing to die? I will do a fine job in accomplishing the task. At 11pm that night, Zusho's corpse was returned to the Upper Mansion in the domain of Akashi. Sir Hanbei! Sir Kito! You're a useless bunch. I told you again and again not to trouble Mamiya's family. And you roped and arrested not only his wife and his son and bride, but even the young grandchild. What a disgrace! It was hard to refuse our lord's order. Out of the way! What do you say? You've served the Akashi clan for generations! You talk of loyalty often, but is loyalty to obey your master... ...or to worry about your own well-being and put down your master? Oh, Hanbei! Yes. I got the message a minute ago... so Doi-Oi finally bent backward. After 3 days of indecision, he imposed no punishment because it was a case of temporary insanity! That serious know-it-all face must have looked real sour! Excuse me, my Lord. What is it, Hanbei? Sir Oi-no-kami earnestly requests you to take care of Mamiya's family as the will of the Central Gov't. I heard. I understand your rage, however, now that the matter's been settled peacefully... ... I beg you to please... - Silence! It's only one senior advisor's crazy ramblings! We don't need to listen to him! My Lord! Enough! It's been hard for you the past three days. Why don't you retire for the day and get some rest? Unfortunately, I can 't afford to do that. Something bothers me. But the matter was settled without any punishment. So at this point... It would have been better if there was some light punishment. Things worked out a little too easily for our clan. But we were given special consideration. - Pricisely. How do you think Doi-Oi 's face would be saved when he's forced to give the special consideration? What could a man in charge of the country's justice of all things... ...do to save face in a scandal like this? Please hold it! Hold it! Let go! It's a little too late now. I see. Too late. Even an infant. How cruel! Everyone! Now, it's crucial that we prohibit members of our clan... ...from talking and clean out Sir Mamiya's house without leaking the news outside! Understand? Understand? Is anyone available? Anyone available? - Yes, sir. Go gather some men at once... ...send them to Sir Oi-no-kami's mansion, give money to the gate keepers and servnts... ...and get a list of visitors at the mansion during the last three days! I was getting impatient. And? - Yes. We handed money to every servnt and managed to find out this much. Let me see it. Toda Shimosa-no-kami, Gold Asset Manager:, Nagai Shinano-no-kami, Chief of Guards,...not them. Kamei Takemoto Housekeeper in Absence:, Hyoemon Kage, messenger of the Satake Family:... Tameemon Sasaki, messenger of Prince Daisuke Otomo-no-shikibu;... Genma Hyodo, 2nd Manager of Carpentry; Tojuro Nakano, Supporting Accounting Manager;... Juroza'emon Okada, Manager of Labor; Makino, retainer of the Owari family. Makino from the Owari family... Yukie Makino is from Agematsu, Kiso last year. That Makino met with Inspector Shinzaemon Shimada. Inspector Shinzaemon Shimada--you know who that is? Yes. He studied academically at the Shohei School... ...and trained in the sword at the Momonoi dojo of the Kyoshin Meichi School. I was often told he's excellent in both areas. Unlike us, he comes from a respected family for generations since Mikawa. Is he truly that sharp? He's a man worthy of entrusting important matters of the country to. If Sir Doi Oi-no-kami chose him... It looks like our clan had the worst luck of the draw. As always, you're impressive. How about a match? It's been some time. Might you not want to conserve your energy when you're about to take on an important job. What, important? All daily duties are important if they're important at all. You know that, too. I wouldn 't bring it up if it was simply about one of those daily duties. When I saw you this morning, I got the sense you took on some extraordinary task. Did you? I guess I need to train harder. Every month and every season, for 1 0 years since I set out on the path of the sword... ... I have received from you more money than an unemployed samurai like me deserves. I accepted the money without refusing, taking it for granted... ...because I held the thought that the time would come when I could repay you... ...by putting my life at risk and waited for that day. I consider samurai is of the spirit of the heart and of determination. If I can't get to put it to use for the occasion... ...I'd have no choice but to regret the 10 years that have passed. So you appreciated my small contributions that much. Sir Shinzaemon. Oh, Kuranaga! If you let his will go to waste, Kujuro Hirayama's samurai spirit won 't be rewarded. I've brought five men I selected from my subordinates... ...and took the liberty of having them wait for you in the room. Even though Kuranaga is Chief Inspector, I leave all my duties to him. He's as tough as your moral teacher. I 've heard much about you. I 'm Saheita Kuranaga. I 've had a close relationship with Sir Shinzaemon. Please consider me his family. Come along, Hirayama. I 'm Gunjiro Mitsuhashi, Chief Okobito Inspector. My subordinates--Okachi Inspectors, Mosuke Otake, and Yasokichi Hioki. Okobito Inspectors, Gennai Higuchi, and Yahachi Horii. I chose both of them from my subordinates. There aren 't as many of them as there seems to be. Of 68 Okachi inspectors and 103 Okobito inspectors, there are too few samurai we could use. All of you are aware your lives will be in my hands, aren 't you? That goes without saying. The chief has explained to us that this is a secret mission. Then let me explain. By private order of Sir Doi Oi-no-kami... ...we've been assigned to take the life of Sir Naritsugu of Akashi. I won't debate the logic of the matter here. I'll spend your lives at my disposal. Akashi has 100,000-koku. And probably it has at least 5,000 samurai. A little more than 1,500 are servng in Edo. In addition, Sir Naritsugu will be traveling back to his territory on the 10th of next month. Once he's in Akashi, that's the end of it. We have little time and few men. It's truly a most difficult job. People think samurai and they think sword. But in this day and age no samurai has ever actually fought with a real sword. None of us and none of them. It's beyond anyone's imagination what actually happens... ...when two men fight throwng their lives at each other. Well then, excuse me. Arrest that man. Find out his title, full name and address. Look sharp. Who on earth are you? You came out of Inspector Shinzaemon Shimada's house. What was the meeting about? Why do you want to know? Are you Akashi samurai? I got it! You know we're Akashi samurai, which means you must be plotting against us. Tell us! Tell us if you value your life. If you don't, I'll kill you. - Better not ask him. Are you one of them? Identify yourself! Kujuro Hirayama, an unemployed samurai. Sir Kito. Refrain yourself from making such visible moves like you did last night. Asakawa... It is so quiet around here right now. This quietness is an omen. Senior Advisor, Sir Doi Oi-no-kami is holding his breath, watching... ...for Inspector Shinzaemon Shimada to accomplish something. And that Shinza is silently waiting in the act of doing nothing until the time is right. What's the matter? Genshiro Deguchi and Kakuma Senda were found dead in the Echizen moat! What? Deguchi and Senda? - Yes, sir! What swordmanship! In only one cut! This makes it clear at last what Shinza aims to achieve. Do you understand, Asakawa? I'm home! I'm home. Hello. No money to enjoy a nightlife. No sake to enjoy a little drink. What are you mumbling about? What if Dad Shimada saw you like this? What? You saw Uncle? Yes. At Yanagibashi just now. I see. That's unusual. It's normally a busy time for inspectors... ...when many daimyo lords' annual journeys are taking place this and subsequent months. Whatever. Nothing a freeloader like me needs to be concerned about. Hey, it might be inconvenient for him if I showed up uninvited, don't you think? Hey. Hey! - What? You... pervert! Thank you for waiting. Let me introduce to you, a friend of mine, Keizo Sawara, a ronin from Bushu. You had told me about Sawara, but who's that young man? Sorry for the inconvenience, but this is my only disciple, Shojiro Ogura. I had intended to stay away and part with him, but I ended up not being able to. Are your parents around? Father passed a year ago, Mother when I was five. I 'm in charge of the kitchen earning a mere 5-ryo and owning 2 men. I am a that can be spent. Please let me join you along with my teacher. What do you think, Kuranaga? We should turn him down under normal circumstances. But since he wishes to join knowng the situation, we have no choice. Then, shall we ask for your help. Thank you very much. I will give up my life to serve. Sawara has an interesting proposition. He will join us if he gets paid 200-ryo. Currency of 200-ryo? You mean... - Well, let me clarify any misunderstanding. My sympathy with your cause has nothing to do with money. But I 'm a ronin with no kind of relationship with you. I don't think you should expect me to work for no money at all. What do you plan to use the money for? Yes. 1 20-ryo for loans and debts that accumulated over the years... ...plus doing something nice for my relatives. 30-ryo for the tomb of my wife who died from the hardships I put her through. 20-ryo for my own preparation. With the remaining 30-ryo... ...I plan to experience the kind of luxuries I never got to have in my life, until the day I pass. You don't seem to use as much for yourself as I expected. Well, pleasing those around me ultimately satisfies... ...my desire to act high-handedly with money at least once in my life. That's interesting! Sir Shinza, his spirit is a bargain for 200-ryo. Sawara. Yes. I accept. A little over a month after this... ...the Akashi clan asked the Central Gov't to excuse themselves and cancel all official business... ...and on October 23... ...it was announced that Sir Naritsugu Matsudaira was to depart Edo and return to his territory... ...early the next morning. Sir Kito. What is it? Carriers and other family servnts are making a scene. What on earth is happening? This isn't going to be the usual annual journey. We need to leave behind the ones who'd cause us any delay and hurry on our way. But there's a stipulated number of men to accompany a daimyo's annual journey. We don't need help from anyone other than samurai. I bet Shinza will gather quite a large number of men if he plans to attack us on the road. Normally, we wouldn 't be able to defend ourselves. Then... We will. Whatever means we need to resort to, we will defend ourselves. I knew something was up... ...but that's an enormous job. Enormous? Sure, it is enormous, but there's no better dying place for a samurai. Battling against the 100,000-koku Akashi clan. That's what you think. I doubt my uncle sees it that way. That man gets truly worried thinking about what trouble he's in. Despite his worries, he smiles and takes on the job. Takes on a job that seems impossible for anyone to do and accomplishes it well. And that's the really great thing about him. But I think this one is impossible. You mean to say you can 't agree with it and you won 't help? I'm not saying I won't help. But I refuse to lose my life for it. I'm an unparalleled prodigal one. I feel more obligated to the geisha who lets me stay with her now than to my status or position. It's been long since I practiced the sword I 'd learned. This is what I 'm learning now. I 'd help out but not with the sword. I'll make myself available for you any time with this one. Tae, see them off. Well, forgive our humble servce. Farewell. Uncle. - Hm? Welcome. - Yeah. I heard they came even though I'd told them it wouldn't work. Did they give you much trouble? Yes, a little. Hey, uncle. You can learn interesting stuff at a geisha house. Recently I studied something a little. What kind of study? Dogs can be owned by humans but cats won 't. They only co-exist with humans. It almost sounds like you're saying you'd rather be a geisha's cat than a samurai's dog. I refuse to have cats that try to please me. Hey, pass that to me. What? Can you play it? Yeah. To tell you the truth, when I was about your age... ... I hated being from a samurai family. I indulged myself in all kinds of stuff fooling around... ...and took this up thinking I'd make a living out of it, but it was much more difficult than it seemed. I realized it was easier for me to die as a samurai than to learn it. Is it right to live indulgently? I realized it was easier to die as a samurai than to learn it. I...think I want to live to the fullest for once. I'll be gone for a while. Do you... ...not like me? When... ...will you come back to me? In less than a month if it's quick. If I'm late... ...I'll be back for the Bon festival for the dead. Burn the welcoming torch and wait for me. The next day, on October 24th... ...Sir Naritsugu Matsudaira Sahyoe-no-kami 's procession... ...departed from his clan's mansion in Edo heading toward his home territory. Well, it's Hanbei, isn't it? It's been a long time. Am I interrupting you? No, we're finished here. Will you guys leave us alone? What? It's okay, just leave us alone. I knew you'd visit me one day and I waited for you. Glad to know you're doing well. If the times were good, I'd have liked to offer you some tea. You came... ...to kill me, didn't you? You're just as persistent as you were in the old days. I envy you. What an ill twist of fate. Since the time I was put in charge of 100 units of Okaji and owned 5 men for 70-hyo... ...I envied Hatamoto samurai from historic families. I secretly wished that one day I'd be like them for I'm a human being like them. And you had great success at it. Then a unit of 10 Okobito men, then a unit in charge of donations... ...you got promoted to positions at an impressive pace. I had hopes for you... ...to become a hatamoto working directly under the shogun. Then, let me tell you that among many historic families... ...Sir Shimada was the only samurai I had aspired to become. I took advantage of the offer to accompany... ...Sir Naritsugu when he was adopted by the Matsudaira family of Akashi... ...and managed to earn 1,000-koku. That 1,000-koku led me into such a situation. I feel like blaming him when I think about it. Perhaps we had no other way to live, you or I. Being a samurai is a helpless job. If Chief Retainer Sir Mamiya... ...had to kill himself I wish he'd done so in front of my lord. I feel then we could've done something about it. I've also thought of killing myself. But I kept seeing the face of his honorable father, the former Shogun, who took my hand... ...and asked me to take care of my lord and the face of my foe Sir Shimada. I accept it as my fate after all and am prepared. Whatever will ensue between us from now on, I hope we'll both act manly as samurai. That's my only wish. I graciously accept the thought. Now, I bid you farewell. See you again. Certainly. Listen. The enemy will probably get half of their men to cross over first and guard their way. Next, they'll put the lord we're after on the boat. We'll seize the opportunity and attack them at full force. In this terrain I wonder how many men each of us can take on approximately? Well, if we can surprise them, I 'd say 3 per man at most. We could let some get away as they have 4 times as many men as we do. Yeah. They're coming! Hide! - Yes. In position! Sir Shinza! Wait! Look. There are two palanquins. One of them must be a double. Which one is it? Most of them are samurai though they're disguised as carriers and servnts. I 'd say there are 1 00 of them altogether. Which one shall we attack, the group on the other shore or on this one? That's clever. Hanbei is indeed capable. The double palanquins, the number of samurai, all in fine formation. Looks like we've lost this round. Can't do that! We've come this far and we're not fighting? I'll come with you if you want to attack! To seek life in death is a warrior's desire. That's where you're wrong. We're human and so are they. Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose. Once we know we're going to lose, it's best to retreat before we get hurt. Sir Shinza, what shall we do? Shinrokuro is right this time. Let's wait until the procession's gone and retreat to Edo for now. Retreat!? We can't! That's right. If we persist and follow them, and wait for the opportunity... ...their guard will be down some time during the long journey. That's right. We've already given up our lives. Don't be rash! We haven't failed yet. Our action is just like a crucial move in chess. We won't be able to do it over. Until we're confident to take the king, we can't make the move! Take a good look while you can. Next time we meet, it'll be a life or death situation. Looks like we managed to avoid trouble. Guess we can relax for now. Our journey has just begun. We have 141 more miles to go before we reach Banshu Akashi. It's too soon to be glad. Sir Matsudaira of Akashi on his journey, stopped at Waraji Station in Bushu the first night... ...and at Ageo Station in the same region the second night. By the ruling justice of the country, you've been relieved of your position. Should you fall at the arrowpoint, your responsibility weighs tremendously. And the day of life and death shall be determined. Wake up. I said wake up! Don't bother me. We're all gonna die anyway. You'd better rest your body while you can. Have a drink. Not for me. I see. At Kumagaya Station in Bushu the third night, at Honjoju the fourth night... ...at Takasaki Station in Joshu the fifth night. Already 30 miles away from Edo. Call everyone. - Yes. Hey, everyone, Sir wants you! Sir wants you! Thanks for waiting. We've solidified our strategy, which I 'm going to tell all of you. But before I do, one thing I want to say is that I won 't tolerate you challenging the strategy. OK? Den 'emon, the diagrams please. Yes, sir. We've decided we'll get Sir Naritsugu Matsudaira right here. At Ochiai Station in the region of Mino. Let me explain the strategy. Kiso has Tenryo in the north and the Owari 's territory in the south. Between Fukushima and Agematsu flows Otaki River. Agematsu, Kiso is where Sir Naritsugu had trouble with the Owari clan samurai last year. So, we'll tell Sir Yukie Makino who serves at Agematsu Camp everything and ask for his help. We'll ask him to use the name of Sir Owari Chunagon... ...and ban Sir Naritsugu from passing through the territory until the matter is settled. Sir Makino saw the tragic deaths of his son and daughter-in-law last year... ...and will probably join our cause. So then, what will happen? The entourage will stall at the Kiso border in the Owari's territory. Sir Naritsugu who's stubborn and self-willed will not dare turn around and go back... ...but will come up with a way to journey through any place but Owari. The possibilities then are... ...to have the entourage's luggage pass through Owari's territory as the Akashi clan 's belongings... ...and Sir Naritsugu himself will take with him only samurai... ...and return to Miyanokoshi, then go via Gonbei Pass... ...to Ina Highway. That means he'll be traveling via Sanshu Highway from Iida to Okazaki. Actually, he couldn't really do that. You must remember, sandwiched between Owari 's Kiso and main territory lies the Naigi clan of Mino. It's the territory that belongs to Sir Toyama Mino-no-kami of the 12,000-koku Naigi clan. When Sir Naritsugu has already sent word of his transit to the clans along Nakasendo Highway... ...if he then has to change his route because the Owari 's blocks them, and retreats as if... ...on the run, skipping Naigi's territory, he'd become the laughing stock of the country. Having to have his own way, and refusing to look bad to a small daimyo lord of a mere 12,000-koku... ...Sir Naritsugu will definitely travel up to Nakatsugawa. There are two routes:. Going via Kiso Pass on Odaira Highway, or via Kamizaka Pass. Either way, he'd have to stop by Ochiai Station. We'll stand by at Ochiai Station, wait for the enemy and get Sir Naritsugu. What do you say? We're in agreement, I'm sure? No, we aren't. What do we do if Akashi's entourage stopped at Otaki River continues on Ina Highway... ...without being concerned about appearances? Even if we get the entourage to divide itself up, they may not stop in Naigi territory. And, that determines the outcome. If we are to fight against Lord Akashi 's entourage... ...with the number of men we have, then, regardless of what measures we take... ... the ultimate key is to attack all-out in one shot. Which means... ...to concentrate the lives of 1 2 in one final location and wait for heaven's will to unfold in our favor. Since we are to wait for heaven 's will, we need to use our resources wisely to prepare. Kuranaga. - Yes. There's no one better suited to talk to Yukie Makino at Agematsu Camp in Kiso to get his help. All right? I 'm counting on you. Yes, certainly. I promise to get the entourage's way blocked. Well then. Now, regarding Ochiai Station... Shinrokuro. Yes. Will you go on ahead of us and negotiate it with the general chief of the town? Yes. How shall I do that? Ochiai Station has 75 inns. Let's say 50-ryo per house in all, which comes up to 3750-ryo. Can you buy up all the inns with the money? I got it. We need to move quickly. Get our horses. Yes. We'll go down Koshu Highway. Run as fast as we can and we'll get ahead of the entourage. Sir Naritsugu's entourage is Shinano-bound via Nakasendo. The autumn in Kiso is over at last and it's November. Ochiai Station in Mino. Hey, this is where Tokubei Sanshuya, the general chief of this Ochiai Station, lives isn 't it? Please excuse our humble room, for it's deep country here. Hey, Kayo, you cleaned the room, didn 't you? Yes. I won 't be any trouble. Yes, this way please. Do farmers carry swords around here? If you're talking about me, I 'm not a farmer. I 'm a country samurai. - Quiet, Koyata. Sorry, he only fancies himself a samurai. But Dad, it's true Koyata is a country samurai, isn 't it? It's no business for women and children. Well, I was the one who brought this up. Forgive me. Go ahead please. Who on earth is that? I heard he's a Hatamoto samurai from Edo. He brought with him a letter of order by a senior advisor of the cabinet...He said something like that. A letter of order by a senior advisor? What kind of order would that be for such country? On November 7... ...Sir Naritsugu traveled through Fukushima, Kiso, nearing the border of Owari Province. Lord! Emergency. What's wrong? The Owari's have issued an order to refuse our transit through their territory. What? To refuse our transit? At this time, by order of Sir Owari Chunagon, we hereby decline Sir Matsudaira Sahyoe-no-kami... ... Head of Akashi Castle in Banshu, to transit through this Owari territory. November in the first year of Koka, Kiso Agematsu Camp, of the Owari clan." How annoying to encounter such an emergency in the middle of our journey! What's the matter? Yes, sir! You fools, you let such a thing happen without doing anything about it? Silence! - My lord! If Owari Chunagon is from one of the three largest families... ...Naritsugu here is the son of the former Shogun and the brother of the current Shogun! I won 't bow down to such a thing! - My lord! Ignore it and cross over! I'll force my way beyond the border and make the 610,000-koku Owari clan cry! Cross over! My lord! We understand your outrage, but... - Silence! If you won 't, I'll cross over all by myself! What! My lord! Wait! Let's see what happens. What for, Sir Kito? We desperately need to go through the Owari territory if at all possible. My lord's usual desire to have it his own way... We'll see it through and find out whether it will work or not. don't go. If the worst should happen, I'm prepared to die in place of my lord. I'm putting my life as a samurai at stake. I won't let you stop this so easily! Who are you? Identify yourself. Out of my way if you want to live. If you don't, I'll kill you without mercy. As you wish. What? It seems you don't recognize me... ...but I am Yukie Makino, the father of the Owari samurai Uneme Makino and his wife... ...whom you killed at the Kiso Agematsu Main Camp in October of last year. Can you successfully kill me and pass through? In the name of the 610,000-koku Owari clan, I promise I will stop you. An impudent one who doesn't know his place! My lord! Oh, Hanbei. Let us go that way just for now. My lord! We'll detour and take Ina Highway to get to Sanshu Highway, then go by sea from Okazaki. Missing the visit to just that one Naigi clan is too trivial to worry about. What do you think? Everyone? If people hear that our way was blocked by the Owari clan during our journey... ...and we missed all visits to the clans along the way and we missed all visits to the clans... ...along the way and ran back to our home territory, we'd be the laughing stock of the country. Are you more concerned about not being a laughing stock... ...or about the life of our lord as well as that of the 100,000-koku Akashi clan? That's what I want to ask you. We may or may not be laughed at, but that'll last only for a year at most. When we return to the capital the followng year, he will be promoted and become a senior advisor. With that status, nobody will be able to point their finger at him! Then, where's the point in risking his life... ...and 100,000-koku for missing just one visit, one single visit? Do you want to hold on to life so much that you're willing to make your lord a laughing stock? I've heard it said that a samurai would choose death to avoid becoming a laughing stock of society. What do you say, Hanbei? Let me tell you something. Why do you think the 100,000-koku Akashi clan has paid and fostered samurai for generations? Please excuse me, but this is a time of emergency. We cannot do without emergency measures. Is it about the Hatamoto samurai called Shinzaemon Shimada? Indeed. Silence! Akashi has 100,000-koku. You are a retainer of this 100,000-koku family, and you're still afraid of... ...some scheme by a poor Hatamoto samurai with a mere 750-koku! How embarrassing! Shame on you! Hanbei. I thought you were a reliable samurai... ...but I see that I was wrong. Listen! No matter what, we will pay a visit... ...to each and every clan along the way including Naigi Toyama's Mino, without missing one! This is a firm order! Yes, sir. We have other measures to take. It won't do without a measure. Sir Kuranaga! Is Sir Shinza here? - Yes, inside here. Take the horse, please. - Yes. I 've just returned. Kuranaga! Thank you for your travel. It's nothing. More importantly, I have good news for you. Makino put his life at risk and succeeded in stopping the Akashi clan 's entourage at Otaki River. Sir Naritsugu took only his guards and detoured to Ina. I see! So we predicted right! Now we know they're going to Ochiai. Kuranaga, what happened to Yukie Makino? - Yes. Well, Sir Shinza... Well, I saw him at Agematsu Camp the night before the incident... ...and told him the details of our scheme and asked him for help... ...then he cried painfully and kept saying... ...he regretted that his family was to end in one generation... ...although he receives salaries from the Owari. And he bowed down his head. The next day, after the incident at Otaki River, he made sure Sir Naritsugu and his entourage left... ...then cut himself on the spot and passed away. As suspected. I see. The Akashi entourage is now divided in two. One with Sir Naritsugu himself accompanied by 52 men... ...Ieft for Ina on Kiso Highway and crossing Gonbei Pass. Uncle! Shinrokuro, thanks for your trouble. Everything is going as planned. This is Sir Tokubei of Sanshuya, the general chief of the station. I 'm Shimada. Thanks for having us. Sorry for the big trouble. No please, not to worry. I 'm the only one who knows everything until after it's over. Please leave it to me. Then, please show them around now. - Yes. And you, Uncle? I'll look at the inn. You come with me. - Yes. And Kuranaga! - Yes. Hirayama, you stay with me too. - Yes. That over there is Sanshuya. This way out to Kiso. That way to Nakatsugawa. So Nakatsugawa in Naigi 's territory is straight down this road, right? If they come out on this street, our group would lose. There's only one street. It depends on how we turn this ordinary road station into a place to finish our job. Hey, is this Sanshuya here? Yes. What? Sir Akashi 's entourage disappeared from Ina Highway? I heard they passed through Komagane yesterday afternoon. After that, no one has seen Sir Akashi 's entourage along the highway. Impossible! There are at least 40 or 50 men. Could it be they are returning to Edo? I see! They might take Kan Highway without passing Iida and come out on Sanshu Highway. After all it's Hanbei Kito we're dealing with here. How about sending another man to check things out? I don't know. If we wander about in an area we're not familiar with, they might find out about us. I understand your concern, but if we make a desperate move, things would fall apart. Calm your mind and wait for the next instruction. Kuranaga. - Yes. November 1 3. Six days have passed already since Sir Matsudaira disappeared from Ina Highway. Hurry! Hurry! What are you doing taking a break? One minute now is worth 1,000 gold coins! Hurry up! Uncle. What is it, Shinrokuro? We have a problem. It seems an outsider has learned about what we're doing. What? Hey, come down. Move it. Is it this man? Yes. He says he's a country samurai. His name is Koyata Kiga. He lives alone and has no parents or siblings. Since he learned it from the host of the house... ...we could make the host keep his daughter inside this house. What to do about him? He not only spies on our business but also wants to join us. I am appalled. I beg you! I'm confident of my sword skills. My father taught me well. I beg you! Do you want a promotion? Not at all. Then what? What he wants is that daughter. They're passionately in love, but her father, the station chief doesn't give him credit at all. So he thinks he'd get his wish if he joined this big job and showed his bravery. Is that how he feels or what you think it is? I don't know. Probably both. Unless you've loved with all your heart, you'll never understand how a man in love feels. It's pretty amazing how such a man would risk his life. It's true. Sir Shinrokuro! They're fools--both the woman and this man. Fools, but if we had to kill them just to keep them from talking... Uncle? No choice, I suppose. Plus, we need more labor with the bridge. How about placing him there? So we have 1 3 men now. November 14. And the followng day, November 1 5. No news all day. That large entourage and no rumor about them at all! Since they haven 't appeared until today... ...it makes me think they must have taken Sanshu Highway heading straight to Okazaki. I agree. That seems like the only possibility. That's right. From Komagane where they disappeared at to this station, it takes a day and a half if they hurry... ...two days at most. They should have showed up a couple of days ago or so. If we give up now, we might lose this valuable opportunity. What do you say if we abandon Ochiai Station tonight, not even tomorrow... ...and cross over Kamizaka Pass to reach Sanshu Highway? That's right. It's the time to make a decision! It's too soon. But Hirayama... - I said too soon! You saw how sharp he is at the Toda ferry landing. With Hanbei Kito with the group, there's a possibility they wouldn 't visit the Naigi clan 's territory. But then they went off the highway and disappeared. No matter how smart Hanbei is, there's no way a group of 40 to 50 men can... ... travel without being noticed! They must be staying in one place, waiting to see our move. They'll come out when they decide it's the day of opportunity. But what if they don't? - They will! But Hirayama! - Silence! We've put our lives in Sir Shinzaemon's hands to begin with. It's tacky to dispute at this point. Hirayama. About the watch we planted at the tea house, I can 't really trust a construction laborer for the job. Can we send somebody else there? I shall go then. You again? Yes. Well, you gave me too much travel expenses the other day. This is an extra job for too little money. But I don 't want to be paid too much, either. So I want you to use me again. Then I 'll ask you. Is that all right? Hmm. - Then excuse me. He's strange. But he's able. Uncle. What? Do you really think Akashi's entourage will come? I don't know. What to do then? The same as Kuranaga and Hirayama. I feel like praying to God. November 1 6. The first frost of the year. I 've heard training is endless work... ...but I can't even handle this one sword. Have you been able to come up with a technique? No. But, with the sword, there's a vulnerable moment when one pulls it out of the sheath, and... ...with the staff, the opponent sees an opportunity when one pulls it out rather than when he attacks. There are techniques to be used for those moments. I was pondering on this and tryng to figure these things out. Hirayama. Yes? They say a man 's life is unpredictable, but not a warrior's life. When he fights aiming to die, he lives. When he fights aiming to live, he dies. I 'm telling myself right now how truthful I've been to the way of the warrior. Excuse me! They're here! They're here! Sir Shimada! Sir Akashi's entourage is here! What? They're here? - Yes. It seems they traveled along Odaira Highway by night. They should be coming down from Tomagari Pass in a minute. Everyone's on horseback. There are 53 of them. They're finally here. November 1 7, the first year of Koka. The early hour of the Tiger (4 am). It was said to be especially foggy from early dawn that day. In position. Yes, sir! How much longer to Nakatsugawa? Yes. I said how much longer! What's going on? Get out! Out of the way! What's this? Hell! Turn around! Turn around! Hell! Near the houses! Hide from the arrows! Near the houses! I presume this is the entourage of... ...the Head of Akashi Castle in Banshu, Sir Matsudaira Sahyoe-no-kami! This is done by the will of Hatamoto Shinzaemon Shimada. Excuse us but we'll stop your transit with bows and arrows! Hide from the arrows under the houses! Go under the houses! Take my horse! My lord! Over here... Don 't abandon your horse! Don 't abandon your horse! Idiots! Get back on! Kill them! You, go back to the bridge and keep watch! - The bridge? Since there are some of the enemy's men on the other side, there must be a way to get back over. Go and look! Otake! Isolate Sir Akashi from the rest! Got it! My lord! Sir Shirakawa! What? We can escape from the passage here! Good! Everybody! Retreat! Retreat! We'll escape from the back street! My lord! Hell! Break down that wall! - Yes, sir! My lord! That's a trap! My lord! Turn back please! Turn back, will you? Get out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way! If you don 't get out of the way, I won 't have mercy even if you're on my side! Naritsugu is under here! My lord! Out of the way! Out of the way! My lord! Turn back! Turn back! Oh Hanbei! We won 't make it this way! Do something! It was a mistake to have brought you in here. Please be patient for a little longer. My lord! What's the matter, Hanbei? This is the last trap that Shinza prepared! We're cornered in. If we're attacked here, there's no way to escape! Sir Naritsugu is in the valley trap! Is Hanbei with him? - Yes, seems he finally caught up. All right! Tell everyone to get down to the alley and fight! If we don't block their way, the fish will escape from the net! I'm curious to see what moves Hanbei will make. I wonder how he'll put up a fight? My lord! You, go towards those two over there. Take down the stack of sacks. I have a hunch there's a way out hidden behind them. Hurry! Take down the sacks! The rest of us will form a human barrier for our lord! Step in front! Move it now! If you don 't do as I tell you, I won 't show mercy even if you're our men! Sir Hirayama! Come at me! Why don 't you show me the true spirit of the Akashi samurai! Come on, hurry up! Hurry! Shojiro! - Yes! Stay on guard! - Yes! Retreat! Kill him! Shojiro! Let's go! All right! Offense is the best defense. Seize the opportunity, push forward! Sawara! We'll go through! Okay! Go through! Sir Kito! Sir Kito!! Niwa! We can cross over the river on Kiso Highway we took by boat. I see! So we can cross over by boat! Listen! Those of you who remained here will turn back on the same road we came! We're at the crucial point where we can make Akashi of 100,000-koku either alive or dead! Push forward with all your might! Yes, sir! Hatazawa, look after our lord! Follow me! What are you doing!? Take our lord! Go! What? They pushed their way back into the same alley? - Yes. Sir Mitsuhashi saw that Sir Naritsugu went at them. But it was few against many. Blocking this alleyway seems the best he can do. Sir Shinza! That Hanbei intends to send his master back on Kiso Highway. Is he willing to fight? No. Hanbei was indeed smart enough to grasp the situation. Ishizuka! Tell Higuchi and Horii, the 2 men who returned from the valley trap, to attack Kito in the main street. Follow me! Don't be distracted! Is our lord here yet? Our lord here yet!? My lord! Help me! If we break down this door, we can get out! Yes! I 'll get you! You're one of them! I'll kill you! Mitsuhashi! Let's go! Sir Mitsuhashi! Sir Mitsuhashi!! Sir Mitsuhashi!! Damn! Higuchi! Low life! Out of the way! Sir Kito! Our lord went back that way again! Damn! That idiot Hatazawa! Turn back! Out of the way! Oh, Sir Shinrokuro! Quick! Hanbei! My lord! My lord! My lord, go over there for now! Hanbei! I waited for you. Are you Shinzaemon Shimada? I presume you are the Head of Akashi Castle, Sir Naritsugu Matsudaira. Due to reasons beyond my power, I shall take your life. Get back, low life! Attacking me is like rebelling against the Shogun 's family! Are you fighting against me knowng that? Let go and prepare yourself. Get back, low life! Get back, low life! Don 't you know I 'm the brother of the Shogun? I can 't say everything is your fault... ... and it isn't easy taking your life... ...but this is for the sake of all people of the country... ...therefore I can't let you go. Hanbei! Hanbei! Asakura! Hanpei! Asakura! My lord! My lord! Shinza, you bastard! Prepare yourself! Wait. Hanbei... ...you and me, one on one. Shinza! Why didn't you defend yourself? Why did you let my sword...? Hanbei... This is the right way. Shinza! Hanbei. Shinza! Hanbei, this is the right way. If I didn't kill your lord, I'd lose my pride as a samurai. If you didn't kill me, you'd lose your pride, too. I see. It's just like you, Shinza. I lose. I'll get you back on the other side. Hiraki! Yes, sir! End the meaningless fight. Signal them. Sir! We've done it! Shojiro, don't chase them! Shojiro! Sir Naritsugu Matsudaira Sahyoe-no-kami got ill on his journey... ...and passed upon arrival in his home territory... ...thus it was reported to the Central Gov't. It was the end of November in the first year of Koka (1844).
