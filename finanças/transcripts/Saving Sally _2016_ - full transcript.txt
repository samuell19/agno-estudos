--== McEphie ==-- Hello, my name is Marty. And this is a story about a girl called Sally. The story happens in the city, which is like any other city, with buildings and monsters. There are monsters on the MRT, street corner, convenience stores. They go to school, work in offices, run the government, and host game shows on TV. They're everywhere. Maybe I'm crazy, but I'm the only one that sees them. I used to think that as long as they didn't bother me, they weren't my problem. Then I met Sally. Weirdo. -What? -You should learn to fight back. Right. Me and what army? Here, I can help you. Bring these tomorrow. Laxatives, film and one peso. A one peso coin? My fee. What? You think I work for free? Meet me at the canteen tomorrow with all of that. Hey! Hey. -Did you bring the stuff? -Yes, I did. A roll of film and some laxative. Right. Hold on. Your receipt. When the dismissal bell rings, go out to the quadrangle. Hey! The room's a mess! Your room's always a mess... So what? -Are you watching porn? -No. Yes! Yes! Can you do that later? I don't have all day, c'mon! -Marts! -Okay. There you go. Okay, Thank you. Okay! I did the groceries in record time and I ran all the way here so I think I have two hours before anyone looks for me. Yes! I wasn't sure you're coming. -What? Didn't you get my message? -I did. You wanted to talk, right? Then, but... Don't call 'cause your parents are there... No, that wasn't the message. It was... And... See. See what? That's my red socks and striped socks. Exactly. Red socks means you wanna talk. Striped socks means don't call 'cause your parents are there. No, that's not what it means. Give me the code book. You wrote this, so... Okay, let me see. Nice. That's yours. You asked me to keep it. You didn't want your parents to find it. Yeah, yeah, I know. All the things that could corrupt me. Here you go. One pair of striped socks means don't call me, but two pairs of striped socks means I'm doing the groceries as an excuse to go to your house. Okay, so why can't we just communicate like normal people do in the 21st century? You know the rules. I'm not allowed to have a cellphone, I'm not allowed to visit anyone's house, I'm not allowed to have sleepovers. You can visit my house but that's only if, "A", you have a really good reason. "B", if my parents are in a good mood. And, "C", the maximum visit is 30 minutes. And, "D", the bedroom is off-limits. Yeah. I wish I could see your room from my window. No. So you wouldn't have to use codes like this. You could hang up a sign. I could look down... You know, or I could learn to read lips. Funny. This was ages ago. Listen, I've been saving up lately, and in a few months I think I can afford to get a cellphone, you think for graduation I could buy you one-- Graduation... Can you believe we're graduating this year? -Did you get yours? -Yeah, yeah, this morning. Well, did you peek? No, we agreed we'd look at it together, right? Right. So can we do this? I mean, my mom's dying of suspense. -Yeah! -Okay. Sal. Come on, let's do something fun. When you said do something, I thought you meant watch a movie- I'm out of ammo. Don't you have enough pictures of sleeping people? I can't help it. People just look so peaceful when they're asleep. It's like the nicest versions of themselves. And, sometimes they just look funny. Okay, we're out! Listen, can we just go back to taking pictures of sleeping people? -He's interesting. -Interesting? He tried to stab me one time. Hey. -Marts. -Yeah. -Kind of need my hand. -What? Right? Classy. Sorry. You ready? Yeah, I guess we should. One... Two... Three. I'm in! I'm waitlisted. Well... That's not a no. It's not a yes either. Nah, my parents don't want me to go to art school anyways. I can come visit you. You'll get in. You'll see. Hey, it's getting late. I should get home or I'll get into trouble. You know, I can take you home. I mean, I can drop you off a couple blocks away. So that they don't know you were with me. No, that's okay, I just-- Yeah, I have somewhere to go before I go home. Your workshop? Yeah, I have to check on something. I can take you there. No, thank you. That's okay. How come... How come you never let me see your workshop? I told you, I'm working on a secret project. Don't jinx it. But I can tell you about it... when it's done. You always say that. Come on, don't be like that. I had fun today, didn't you? I did. Even though you have a secret project. Come on. And you eat like a pig. And laugh like a horse. But you like me anyways. -Sal. -Yeah. I... I'll see you tomorrow, right? Yeah. Well, I have to do some laundry, so maybe we can go to Kosmik Komiks? -Sounds good. -Okay. And I'll see you tomorrow! Hey. Did you sell any of your comics yet? It's all still here. What? Why? Your stuff is good. You know why. I mean, If I could afford to do this in color, I'm sure I'd sell some. Your comics don't need color, they're great. Better than some of this stuff. -They're like papayas. -But I like papayas. -Hey, you know what I don't get? -What? How come these people never notice that the geeky guy is the superhero? I mean, they look the same, come on! Well, 'cause no one ever looks at the geeky guy, you know? Well, I would. I'd rather go out with a geeky guy, than some boring alpha male. -Really? -Yeah. I like geeks. I'm a geek. We're more interesting. Wait. Here, before I forget. Right, so I feel kind of bad about yesterday, and... You not being able to go to the workshop. But I made you this so you don't feel left out. -What's-- -So you can... "Earth to Sally" me. -Here. -Roger that, captain. Gotta go. Right, Bye. And I'll see you tomorrow! Hey, it's me. Hey, what happened? Is anything wrong? Are you coming to the field trip tomorrow? 'Cause you've been missing a lot-- I... Wait... Sorry, Marts, I have to go. Bye. Sal, you're late. You missed the whole documentary on the big bang. It was in 3D. -Really? -Yeah. So when we rule the world, what countries do you want? You can keep all of them. I don't really like it here. -See the puppy? -Yeah. It's missing an ear, though. Probably bitten off by that dragon. See that? Sal? Anything you want to tell me? Like what? I don't know. There might be something you want to talk about. No, not really. Why weren't you in school again? I was doing a test run on one of my inventions. What kind of invention? It's a new way to fly. -Did it work? -No. I had some technical difficulties. -Hey, I have to go. -No, no, wait, wait. Are you... Are you okay? Yeah, it's just one of those days. I just want to get away from everything. But thanks, Marts. You're one of the few good things in my life right now. I love you, Sal. -What? -No! God loves you. Like your mom always says. -You making fun of me? -No! Not at all! Good one. No, see what I meant to say... What I was trying to say was that-- Nope, it's okay. I'll just forgive you tomorrow. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Pa. How do you tell someone you love them? Well... You know... You should ask your mom. God. You're growing up so fast. Ma. So, who's the lucky girl who my handsome baby boy loves? Is it... I don't know, maybe, I'm just guessing. Is it Sally? Ma. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I know how you kids like your privacy. You know, you remind me so much of your dad. -Great. -Yeah. And he couldn't tell me how he felt either. Really? Don't worry. You know, you cannot force these things. You have to wait for the right moment. And when it comes, then you tell her. -How long did it take for Dad to tell you? -Twelve years. What? Sorry. You all right? Yeah, it's just kind of hot today and I haven't really slept much. Yeah, me neither. Sal, where'd you get that? Get what? That thing on your neck. I was wrestling with this bear. Sal... Okay, you caught me. I was making out with this vampire. Come on, Sally. Those things can suck. Marts, relax. I'm clumsy. You know me. I trip, I fall. Can we just talk about this for once? I know what happens. Sal, why do you let them do it? I remember you telling me. That you were little when your real mom left you. It must have been terrible not knowing why... What to do, where to go... I understand that these people took you in. And you feel grateful. You say they're the only family you know. But it still doesn't make it right, Sal. What is it this time? You came home late? You used the phone? You forgot to wash the dishes? Please. Let's talk about this. I'm here for you. 'Cause I love you. Hey, can I borrow your math notes? I kind of missed the last lecture. All right. Thanks. I gotta go. Thanks. No! No! No! Hello? Sally, are you there? Hello? Hello? Sally? Hello? Sally, it's me, Marty, come in! Sally, are you there? Hello? Sally? Hello? Hello, Sally? Sally? Sally? Come in. Sally? You there? -Hello. -Sal. Listen, if you're avoiding me... That comic book meant nothing. All the characters were fictional. -What comic? -The one in my notebook. Nothing. Nothing. Hey, I'm finishing early today. You wanna go out later? Well... I don't mind. Great. I'll just see you there then. Bye. Yes! I think it's all right that she doesn't know how I feel right now. There's still lots of time. And next time, I'll tell her myself. At the right moment. I can tell her at the school interims, or the field trip to the power plant, Foundation Day, or maybe I should wait till after the exams, and tell her at the prom. Yeah, right. Her parents definitely won't let her go. Maybe I can tell her at graduation, and she can be my girlfriend when we go to college. Summer, I'll tell her in the summer. Do you think I'd look better with bigger boobs? Yeah. So much better. Why don't you make some? Yeah, I can use some old shoulder pads and maybe some airbags. And then you can beat your chest to inflate yourself. Yeah! No, but seriously, do you think I'd look better if-- Sal, you know what, stop. You look fine just the way you are. So you think I'm pretty? Marts? Have you ever really liked someone? Like, really liked someone? Why? I was just wondering if you liked anyone enough to do something even if you thought you'd get into trouble. Like, for example, like you wanted to get together, but you knew it would be hard if you did. -Will you still do it? -Yes. Yes, of course. Really? You'd have the guts? Well, you know, if I really liked her and I thought she was worth it. Yeah, why not? Okay, I'm out of time. They might wonder where I am. -Give me a hand with the bags. -Sure. Okay. -Bye, Marts. And thanks. -Bye. Yeah, sure. Sal? No. This is Toto Calasanz from Renegade Publishing. -May I speak to Marty? -Yeah, this is me. This is him. I'm Marty. Right. Hi. I got your number from one of your self-published comics. Listen, are you free tomorrow? So you're Marty. Yes, sir. Don't call me "Sir," it makes me feel old. Come on have a seat, don't be shy. Is that you're portfolio? Let me see. Let me see. This? It was an accident with a parrot when I was five. No pirate jokes. You draw better than I thought. -My grades are in there too, if-- -What are your favorite comic books? Clairemont, X-Men, Batman, Superman-- Mostly superhero stuff, huh? I like other stuff, too. -Blankets, Sock Monkey-- -Sock Monkey. Well, you seem like a good kid. Let me get straight to the point, I want to put your work out professionally, on high quality paper, properly bound, and maybe even put it out in color. So, you interested? Okay, but let me ask you one question, can you come up with something new? Something new? Yes, the kind of story that doesn't belong in a ratty cardboard box in the comic shop. Something that deserves to be on the shelves, on display. -You get me? -Yeah. -So you'll do it? -Sure, but-- Great! Okay, kid. You have one month to produce a pitch for a story. If I like it, I'll distribute it locally, and who knows, if we're lucky, international sales! Right, so think about it. We go into a comic book store and what do we see? We see Batman, Superman and my comic book right next to all of those. See? I told you, you were good. I'm right about everything. Well, because then, you won't need a fine arts degree, and I can get your slot. So what's your comic about? Well, I don't know... yet. But I do know that I want to call it "Battle Worlds." Right? I thought of that. All this excitement and all you have is a title. -I mean, the title's 50% of everything. -Yeah? If you have a good title, you are set. -I have something to tell you. -I have something to tell you. -What? -What? You go. It's kind of weird. What is it? You know what, it's getting kind of late. Maybe I should just tell you some other time. No, what were you gonna say? Nah, next time. Okay? No, I need to know now. I... have a boyfriend. Get dressed. You're coming with me. Where are we going? Where men go when they've got... girl problems. So... What's the problem? Well, I like this girl, Sally. Yeah, that one. Does she like you? Nope. She has a boyfriend. Boyfriend? Did you at least tell her how you felt? Well, I tried to, but then, she told me the boyfriend news. So, she has a boyfriend? Yes, Dad, that's what I said. It's not too late, you know? Not too late to what? Tell her. If she doesn't feel the same way, you could always say it's because she has a boyfriend. And, if they do break up, you'll be first in line because you already told her how you feel. Wuss. Just tell her. Just tell her. Okay, here we go. It's you, Marty. I just came by to give Sally her stuff. She wasn't there when we had to clean out her lockers. Is that so? Let me see that. Well, come in then. Dear, it's Marty. Good afternoon, sir. So, Marty, what brings you here? He's here to bring some of Sally's stuff. She left it in her locker, sir. She's in the kitchen. You have five minutes. -Hey. -Hey, Marts. I haven't heard from you in ages. What's up? I'm grounded. Why? My parents found out about Nick. -Who's Nick? -My boyfriend. Dad went crazy. Mom took me to the doctor to check if I was still... You know? And? So how'd they find out? They found my cellphone. You have a cellphone? Yeah, for, like, two days. Nick bought me one and I forgot to put it on silent. They heard it ringing and they found it. I'm such an idiot. Anyways... Mom said she won't let me go to Fine Arts if I don't break up with Nick. You're in Fine Arts now? Yeah. I'm off the waiting list. Didn't I tell you? I must have told Nick. Anyways, my mom said I have to agree to not have a boyfriend until they allow me. -Which is when? -I don't know, when I menopause? Okay, so... I need you to tell Nick something. Give me your hand. All right, can you just tell him that we have to, like, quiet things down until this whole thing blows over? -How am I supposed to do that? -That's his number. Sally! He's on his way out! Thanks, Marts, I owe you big time. Now get out of here before I get into more trouble. Dick? -I'm sorry, did you just call me Dick? -That's your name, right? It's Nick. Who the fuck are you? Right, whatever. I'm Marty. Marty? Shit! My bad. Sorry, man. You're Sally's friend. My bad, man. So, what's up? Well, Sally got caught. She can't see you. Yeah, so... What do you want me to tell her? Tell her I feel horrible and... If she wants to sneak out this Saturday for a drink, for a movie, or whatever. I'm there. She can't. How about you just tell her that I miss her. No, no, sorry. Tell her I miss her a lot. And that I'll wait no matter how long it takes. Anyway, I gotta go, I have another meeting. It was nice meeting you, Farty. Marty. Dickhead. He's cute, isn't he? -He's old. -He's not that old. He's 28. And you're 17. It's more than a decade. Well, we met at the comic shop. Our comic shop? The one we go to? Yeah. He likes the same things we do. Comics, movies and he used to be in a band. Okay, don't laugh, but he kind of likes action movies. What? Like, Bruce Lee action? I wish. Hollywood blockbuster action. That's terrible. -You know that's terrible. -I know, I know. But I really miss him. You know, I keep writing him letters, but I can't find a way to send them to him. Can't you invent something? I'm trying, but everything I make blows up. Can't seem to get the right parts. I'll do it. -What? -I'll do it. I mean, write as many as you want, give them to me and I'll give them to Nick. No way! Here! Thank you! Okay, I had to put it somewhere that my parents wouldn't find it. Thank you! No big deal. Really. You know, it's kind of tough dating someone older. Every time he starts talking about work, I feel so stupid. I feel like all of my home drama's so childish. It must be driving him crazy, all this sneaking around. He's your boyfriend, Sal, I mean, he should be more supportive, right, and understanding. He does talk about marriage. -What? -Sally! He's on his way out! -Sorry, Marts, you know the drill. -Yeah. I'm going. Sal, this whole marriage thing... You're not considering it, are you? Sal? I'm not. Really, I promise. It's just nice to think that I'd finally get out of here. Here. Yeah. Yeah, she wants me. So what'd he say? He didn't really say much. Just sort of sat there. But he did say that he misses you... And your smile is so precious. So, you shouldn't waste it by being sad. -Really? -Yeah. Okay. Wait, here, give him this. So, what do you want me to tell her now? You know, I was going through my things the other day and I came across... these old lyrics that I wrote when I used to be in a band. You know, I was thinking what should I write her, what should I tell Sally and then I came across this. Said, "Damn, how appropriate." -You wanna hear it? -Sure. All right. "Baby, when I kiss your lips, my heart does flips, never a sad flower when you're around. Baby, baby, sweet baby, I miss you so, come take my hand, and we can go... Buttercup sweet fool. I'll rock your world in my swimming pool." What do you think? -Good. -Good? -You want me to sing it? -No. I mean, that was good. So anyway, how long do you think this grounded thing gonna last? I really can't say. Sally's parents are complicated. They treat her more like an inmate than a kid. I know. That's fucked up, man. When she told me about that, I said that's messed up. I'm surprised they even let her play soccer. Soccer? Soccer. Where she gets all her bruises. Yeah. Sal. Nope, it's Toto. Why'd you miss our meeting? There's just so much crap going on and I totally forgot about the drawings and everything's just-- Hey, relax, relax! I was just kidding. You still have six days. I'm just getting a little excited. So, how's the pitch coming along? It's... Well... I wanna surprise you. Playing coy. Okay, then, I'll let you get back to it. -So, see you next week? -Yeah, next week. Okay. I'm so screwed. How's Sally? Well, she's grounded, Ma. Her parents found out she has a boyfriend. Really? You mean... Nope, someone else. Ten, eleven, twelve. You know, I just realized I know nothing about you. Are you supposed to ask about me? Well, not really, except that, you know... We've been meeting almost everyday and all we do is talk about me and Sally. And I haven't really asked anything about you. Well... I am actually hoping to become a comic book artist. No shit. Yeah. I'm in the middle of a pitch to Renegade Publishing. That's pretty cool. -Congratulations. -Well... Don't congratulate me yet. I haven't gotten it. So, what's the story about? Well... A bunch of monsters that invade Earth and remaining humans that band together to fight. That's it? I mean, yeah. That's it. That's pretty basic, isn't it? I mean, it's just... Good versus evil. Monsters versus humans-- No. See, what you don't know is how I'm gonna draw it. It's gonna be epic. But it's just too simple. I mean, does... Does it have to be too black and white? The monsters, do they all have to be bad? Yeah. Well, sorry, man. I didn't mean to impose, you know. It's just my two cents' worth. No... No, no, don't apologize. That's actually pretty good and it makes sense. And so these monsters invaded Earth, okay? And it triggered the Third World War. Aliens versus mankind. There's a power struggle and all the chaos, explosions, all of that was just the backdrop for a more internal struggle. A struggle involving loyalty, treachery and conspiracy. Macross meets the Philippine Senate. And the villain who looks like a giant penis? Well, he tries to convince humans that he's a good guy. But he's actually not. I don't know yet, we'll see. Yes! Yes! What are you doing here? The gate was open. You look like the bearer of good news. Well, I got it, Sal. I got the job. I never doubted that. Congratulations. Thanks. Well... I have a little over a month to write and pencil it. I could use a good inker. You interested? Busy, remember? Don't jinx it. You wanna watch a movie tonight? A blockbuster action movie? Pa, can I borrow the car? What? Can I borrow the car tonight? Okay. But... You better take care of it. I just redid the paint. It's on the shelf. No, Dad, I meant the real car. Right. Okay. It's... Drive safe. Thanks, Dad. Ma? I... I'd hate to shatter your image of me as a love machine, but I highly doubt that anything will happen tonight. Someone left crumbs in the back seat. Here. Sorry. Sorry, I'm late. How do I look? You look great. Thanks. Okay, quick. I'm excited. I'll change my shoes in the car. Special treatment. This is so crazy. I've never done anything like this before. I can't believe I actually got out. I'm so psyched. So, how did you get out? Well, I didn't have much to work with... So I reconfigured the vacuum cleaner and made it sound like it was breathing and I put it in my bed so that they would think I was asleep. Then I went through the crawl space in the ceiling. It was so hard, I almost lost my nerve before I made it to the roof. Then, from there, I used the laundry to make a rope and my hanging machine to rappel down. I set that aside and then climbed over the fence. Then I just ran like crazy, all the way here. It was so scary. Hey, let's go before I get caught, come on. He said eight, right? Yup. He'll be here. He always shows up. Sorry I'm late. -Hi. -Hey, baby. Look at you. -You look great. -Thanks. -Did you miss me? -Of course. My girl. Hey, thanks for this, man. I owe you one. Sure. Well... Have fun, kids. Hey, you wanna catch the film with us? No, thank you. Well, come on, Marts, and I haven't seen you either. You can just watch the movie with us. Speed Hard 3 wasn't exactly on my list of things to do. So, no, thanks. Stop. We have no sign of life. Are you sure you're gonna be okay? Yeah, I'm sure. How are you getting back in? Same way I got out, I guess, just... Backwards. You all right? Yeah. Marts... Even if I do get caught and maybe grounded a million times over, don't worry, it was worth it. Thanks. Yes! Hi, Ma. You're here, I didn't notice. So, how was it? Well, it was good. Anyway, goodnight, Ma. What did you wanna talk about? -Nick? -What's that? You called me, what... Yeah... I asked you here 'cause I wanted to give you this. "Disco Inferno"? Disco Inferno. That's gonna be the biggest underground rave party ever. I don't know man, it's not really my thing Please, please, just take it, all right? Think of it as my way of saying thank you for the other night. Well, yeah, you're welcome. You know, thanks to you, she wants to sneak out again. Wait... She contacted you? Yup. She actually used her dad's cellphone while he was in the other room. So what are you guys gonna do? I don't know, man. We're definitely not gonna watch a movie. What's that supposed to mean? You gonna take her shopping, what? You gonna picnic? What? Okay. Let me give you a little tip. Real men don't brag to other guys what they do to who, where they do it or how they do it. If you remember that, girls will respect you more and guys will actually think you're a bigger stud than you really are. He could have at least waited until you got inside. Marts... What are you doing here? Just making sure you got home okay. It's 4:00 a.m. Yeah, I know. Why are you home so late? I don't know, "Dad." I was having fun and lost track of the time. What's the big deal? Fun doing what? Goodnight, Marts. I just don't want to see you get hurt, okay? Marts... Look at me, I'm happy. I'm glad you're okay and happy. You missed a button by the way. -Yes? -Hey, Marty, you sound wrecked. I didn't get much sleep last night. Really? I had a pretty interesting night myself-- -What do you want? -Just checking to see if we're still on for tonight. -Tonight? -Disco Inferno, remember? Aren't you glad you came out? Well, I wanted to keep my friends close and my enemies closer. -What? -Nothing. So, how do you know Nick? He's dating a friend of mine. Really? I heard he likes them young. But he hasn't hit on me yet. I'm sorry? I'm kidding. Nick's a great guy from what I hear. Hey, man, if you're gonna puke, let me know, okay? -I can pull over. -Back off, you prick. "Prick"? What the hell was that for? Shit! You take a guy out, you introduce him to a fine lady, get him wasted, the least he can do is show some fucking gratitude. I mean, don't you know how to have fun? Fun? Like the fun you were having with that girl? What girl? Gina? Is that her name? Look, I am not fucking around behind Sally's back. All right? I don't do that. I love her. Sally says you want to marry her. Well, I would... Sure, not now. Maybe five years from now. You know, like, who wouldn't wanna marry her? She's great. She's fun. Yeah, I'd marry her. Wake up, Marts. Where we going? Just follow me. Here, wear this. Hurry up. I'm technically still grounded. My parents are just too lazy to do their own groceries. So, what are we doing here? Just making sure that I'm not... You know... Shouldn't you be doing this with someone else? He's busy. Busy... He didn't seem too busy yesterday. Look, Nick's not like us, he's... He's got responsibilities, he has a job-- Right. Right, responsibility. Why don't you just pick something up from the drugstore? I did. Just trying to be sure. Gotta go do this. I'm good. I'm good. Everything is good. I'm fine. Thank you for doing this with me. Hey, this is Nick. I'm not here right now. just leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you. Hey, Nick. Did you get my text? We need to talk. Hello? Hey, Sal. What are you up to? Just stuff. Have you talked to Nick? No, I haven't heard from him. Have you? No, he hasn't passed by the café and he doesn't reply to any of my texts. Maybe he just lost his phone or something? Well, where does he work? Do you want me to pass by and check? No, you don't have to. He'll call. You're not grounded anymore, are you? No, it's my first day of freedom. -They're making me-- -You wanna go look for comics or... Sorry, I can't. I'm going to the workshop today. Your secret project. Yeah, sorry, Marts, I haven't got much time. Bye. Marts... Has Nick called you by any chance? What? I thought you guys were already seeing each other by now. I haven't heard from you in days. Sorry, I've just been busy. Well, anyway, thanks. Maybe he just got tired of waiting for me. Yeah, I don't blame him. It's not like I'm worth the wait. What are you talking about? You're the funniest, weirdest, most beautiful-est girl ever. -Ever? -Ever. Thanks, Marts. I'm glad the laws of best-friendship require you to flatter me. -Hey. -Hey. What are you doing here? I told my parents I'd do some back-to-school shopping. You in? Yeah. What? What? The spray paint, staple gun, batteries. A bit exagge for school supplies, right? It's not for school. Don't-- Don't jinx it. -Okay. -Exactly. What were you thinking? I was gonna save you. Let's get out of here. You knew, didn't you? -Knew what? -About that girl! I saw them at a party once, okay? And he said they were friends. Well, how stupid are you for believing him! How stupid are you for liking him? I wanted to tell you, all right? I was going to but, he said... He said he really loved you, Sal. -I'm sorry. -Forget it. Hey, how's your comic going? Not really doing much. I have a few ideas though, like, I was thinking maybe the lead human... He can be infected by this virus and... He goes through this whole internal struggle, trying to stay good, you know... And he's trying to hide it from his team the whole time. No one on his team knows until it's unavoidable. They all just find out his secret. I like this one the most. You can have it. So what happens now? I guess... I guess I ask you how you feel about this. How you feel about me. Well, to be honest I did have a crush on you back in sophomore year, when I... When I helped you out with that bully thing... Then we became friends. And I started to see you as-- Stop. -Stop right there. -Sorry. Sorry. Yeah, Nick said that's the worst thing you can say to a guy. Are we still talking about Nick? No, no, I... Sorry... Shit. Maybe in time you'll change your mind. Maybe I can try. You can try. I'm sorry. I won't. Just not now, okay? Bye, Marts. Bye. Sal. -So sorry to disappoint you. -Toto. Yeah, you were supposed to keep me updated on your progress, but all I have are several really well-rendered drawings of a monster that looks like a porn star's dick. Toto. I'll have my panels in seven days. Okay? You better. I'm so stressed, I can't even enjoy my '70s retro porn. -I'm sorry? -I'm sorry too! I know what I presented was a sci-fi war epic, but I thought of a better story. About a girl who's literally in the center of the universe and a boy astronomer who is drawn to her light. The girl is stolen by a band of monsters who keep her in an impenetrable fortress. They enslave her and keep her from her birthright. She thinks her only way out is marrying this monster prince, 'cause she feels that living with one monster, is better than living in a fortress full of them. All this time, the boy plots her rescue from his observatory. Well... So it's a fantasy. It's a love story. You hate it. No, I don't. I haven't cried this much since Optimus Prime died in Transformers: The Movie. The animated one, okay? You're not crying. I weep inside. It's just that... This story just came to me, you know. Okay, okay. Visually, it's good. It's surreal and light at the same time. I love the hero and the fact that he is flawed. He's... Skinny. The girl, too. Victim of circumstance, but makes good of what she can. -Nice. -And there's a but... It's just that love stories weren't the path I was headed. I know. You wanted mayhem, war, chaos... Yes! But isn't that what love is all about? Come in! Hey, Marty. Long time no see. -Hey, nice patch. -You like this? My girlfriend made it. She's into sewing. And that's all I'm saying about my personal life. Here's what you came for. Your moolah. Check it out. It's more than usual. It's been a good month. I have an idea. Why don't you quit school and come work full-time. Nah, I don't think so. I like school. Thanks, Toto! Hey. You deserve it, kid. Come on, get out of here before you make my one good eye cry. -See ya. -Okay. Don't spend it all on booze and girls. That's what I'd do if I didn't have a girlfriend. So, how much do you think a copy of this comic would sell on eBay if it were signed? A lot. But I heard that this artist doesn't do autographs. Hey, I'm joking. I'm joking. How you been? Good. How've you been? Busy. Me too. Hey, I meant it. You have to sign. -Here. -There you go. Big star signing my comic. Really proud of you, Marts. Hey, is your girlfriend still in Australia? Yup. When is she coming back? She is not. She's there for good. But, you know, she's getting used to the accents and all that. So, she's adjusting. It's tough though. How are you and your boyfriend? We broke up. You know, I... I never got the chance to thank you for that book. That was a long time ago, Sal. I know. But I still have it. And I plan to sell it when you get crazy famous. Not that that's too far from now. Go for it. I mean, as long as I get a cut, I'm fine with that. It was all junk anyway. Hey. No, it wasn't. It was good. I mean... To me, those were, like, the best drawings you've ever done. I'm really glad we're friends again. Me too. See you tomorrow. Hi, Ma. Hi, honey. There's mail that came in for you. I put it on your bed. Okay. Thanks. Sally. What... What happened? You should go before they see you. No one's here, just tell me what happened. I was trying to get something -off the shelf and I slipped. -Sally, come on. that's bullshit! -And this book fell on me-- -You know that's bullshit. Just tell me what happened. It's just a bruise. I mean, it's no big deal. You shouldn't be worried. Sally, why do you put up with this? Why don't you do something? Run away... Anything! Why didn't you do something? Sorry. Sally, I would have. I would've-- No, no, I wasn't supposed to say that. I mean, look who's talking, right? You should come in. You can't stay here. Sal... Let me get my stuff. Here. Here, fill this up. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Sal! I'm leaving! Sally! Don't be stupid. Duck! No way. Yeah. But I don't need it anymore though. Why not? 'Cause I'm staying here with you. Once there was a boy. He knew a girl who carried the world on her shoulders. Every day he would ask her, "Do you need help?" But she would say, "No, thank you. It's not that big." And the world would seem a little bigger. One day, the boy decided to give her a gift. "I cannot accept that." "But why?", the boy asked. "It's yours." "I'm sorry," she said, "but I cannot carry anything more." And the boy was very sad. The next day when he went to see her, the girl was gone. He waited and waited for her to return. The sun set and the moon rose but she did not come back. Finally. the boy said to himself, "I must leave this place." He travelled the universe, crossed rainbows, rode comets, painted nebulas, and even tamed stars. Suns slept and moons waned, but he could never forget the girl who carried the world on her shoulders. One day, he saw her again. "Hello," she said as if she had never left. "Hello," said the boy, doing his best to seem calm. "I see that you have gone very far." "You must have many things to share. Tell me a story." The boy thought for a while. "I have only one thing I want to tell. I've traveled light years and I've seen many wonders. But I've never forgotten you. I still carry this wherever I go." Did she take it? No. Her hands were full. But he did help her carry the world.
