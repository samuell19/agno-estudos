After I've called you all this way. Sorry, I can't listen to this very much. It's embarrassing. I don't think so. You had a lot of confidence in that piece, too, didn't you? That's why I chose it. I am glad of that Fujiwara-san, an instructor in the vocal music department, took my composition to heart even though I am not a teacher at this school. But when I listen to it now, I realize that it is still a weak imitation of something foreign. As a composer, this is the saddest thing I have ever done. But I think there is something in it that only Takashi Komaki could have done. I think that the national music and national opera company that you are always insisting on can only be created by building on that. Oh, Komaki-san? I'm looking for Mie. She's out singing now. ♪ The white sail of life ♪ ♪ in this chest ♪ ♪ We are sailors, ♪ ♪ sails lined up, ♪ ♪ smiling, ♪ ♪ We travel together ♪ ♪ on the boundless ocean ♪ Yumiko, Dr. Komaki is here. Doctor? Hello. Hello. Nice song, sir. I hope you enjoyed it. Well, it was alright. Perhaps we are still not good enough. No, your singing was fine. I received a telegram saying that our father was in critical condition. It says it would be better to go back home right away. Yes, you should do so. But I... the last chorus. The sooner the better. Why don't you have Kawakami-san send it to us? Yeah. You should do that. In times like this, families are the most important. Right? Icchan, grandma wants to see you. Alright. Let's have a celebratory white sake now. Yumiko-san? Promise not to be angry with me but I'm leaving. Promise? Mom is already preparing for the graduation celebration expecting that we'd be having the festivities together. It's about graduation. With my father gone, I'm thinking of leaving the music school, Mie-san. But, Mie-san. I'm troubled. If you left I'd be troubled, too. What's going on? You can't tell me? No, not really, but... I understand. It must be about Hagiwara-san, right? I thought so. Well, then. I'm definitely going to have to interfere. There's something I've been meaning to tell you. I thought it was a bad idea. I know about changing your name, singing American jazz songs. I think there are better ways to be happy without doing that. I've actually already asked my mother and brother and they've agreed. Chizu-san, will you live at my house and continue your studies? Then we can all join Fujiwara-sensei's opera company together. Is this pity? No, it's friendship. Mie-san, your older brother has been studying music all alone until now. You've impressed me. I feel so sorry for your mother, too. Would you do that for me? Yumiko-san, you are very kind. I don't know what it feels like to be sympathized with. I'm sorry. Sympathy is a wonderful thing. But it's like getting some special rice cake. You shouldn't count on it. You can't live on it. If I were to stay, I'd just keep running into my past. I must leave and find my happiness somewhere else. I am so thankful for your friendship that it brings tears to my eyes. But that and this are different things. I'm sorry. Now, if you'll excuse me. Chizu-san! Auntie, were you crying because your friend left? You are a very stubborn man. Absolutely. Yeah, yeah. But it could be true. I'm graduating. I didn't realize how lonely graduation would be. The three of us are already separated. I wonder if this is our destiny. Our destiny is just beginning. It will change with the world. ♪ Fall, blue rose ♪ ♪ On the window sill of spring ♪ ♪ in the hazy night, see... ♪ I'm home. Welcome back. Welcome back. I'm going to go shopping in a minute. Mie-san, come home safely. You're late. Oh, I walked from Tokyo Station. What? I had time to catch the train, so I had a precious dinner. Lucky you. I can't believe I got to eat rice. I'll say. You shouldn't do things you're not used to. There wasn't a lot of money left after that. Six sen, six sen. I see, not enough to ride the streetcar. There's nothing you can do but walk. If it was a penny, Mie-san would have been better off. No. My feeling of having bought it will be zero. After all, it's only one penny. That's okay. Only beggars get a penny. Hey, don't put that crap in my ear. You're place, your choice. A complete enemy. That kind of music is an enemy to us musicians. And to all Japanese people. It's opium. You're starting again. Don't you think so? Don't you care? Don't be stupid. Haven't we been friends ever since I was sent from the music corps to study at Ueno? It has been nearly six years since then. Now, I'm a military band sergeant myself. I thought you'd understand me most of all. Lately, you've been acting kind of wishy-washy compared to back then. We were so young back then. We both loved a lot more things. So, are you going to run away now? I can't talk about it. You seem to be the one running away; running away from what you're meant to do. The guy who thinks eating at the train station is extravagant. What? You are having a nervous breakdown these days. Maybe when you get married to Yumiko and have a family, things will settle down. Yumiko is crazy about you. Well, I think she'd be good for you. Are you kidding me? No, not at all. What? Don't just be angry, take action. Do something about it. If you just lament the snobbery of the musical masses and resent the evils of American jazz, you accomplish nothing. To shoot the enemy, you first need a bullet. You've been thinking only in terms of logic to make that bullet. You should be able to compose excellent music. As long as you put your gift to good use, that's all that matters. Don't you think? My hometown of Yamato is the birthplace of the Japanese military music. Just the other day, he thought we had completed the first seventh day of the Buddhist memorial service. It will be 35 days soon. That was quick. I thought you would never make it back in time, but it's still early. With that alone, at least I did something. But still, it's a pity. He used to laugh at me, saying that I was a miserable girl who just sang like a sparrow. but I wish he could have seen me when I graduated. Your father knew exactly how you felt. But, from now on, let's talk about the future. What do you mean from now on? As you know, your father was a man who thought only of you. Now I realize for the first time that this house is the property of the Shimoda family. I was about to leave this house alone. Letting go of this house and going to Tokyo with my mother. I don't know if it's for the best. When I think about my father, it doesn't matter. So, as I was saying, Living here with my mother. That's the best thing. Fujiwara-sensei's opera company is something I've been looking forward to for a long time. Such a thing, at this time. Sister, are you giving up on going to Tokyo because of me? Not because of you. It's about this house. It is our duty, all of us, to protect this house which has been handed down to us by our ancestors. Then I will follow in my father's footsteps. Shouldn't we protect this house? Yuu-san, you are a man. It's different for women. Don't you think I'm ready? That's what I'm saying. You are the one who needs to study and learn to be of great service. This house stands on your shoulders. It is up to you whether you want to tarnish our name or not. You know that. Then isn't it true that you should be going to Tokyo? After all, my sister is here. This is a big opportunity for you, a long-awaited one. The music that I studied is not only useful for opera. There are still many other things I can do to help. I've already been to the elementary school and met the principal. You're going to be a music teacher? I am qualified to be a teacher. Let's have dinner. Sit down, Yuu-san. Make the 'Ha' sound, alright? 'Ho' sound. Alright. Right. Now let's write some chords. Everyone, get out your workbooks. Sakamoto-san. Yes. Write it on the blackboard so everyone can see. Is that correct? Good. Next, Kawakami-san. Yes. Welcome. Hi. Hi. This is a good place to meet. I hear you will be heading for the front lines soon. Congratulations! Thank you. I finally got my wish. The next war won't be settled if China is the only opponent. Five more years before I meet the real enemy. Yes. No, even if it takes ten years, I might not be able to get there next time. Really? Yes, that is my intention. When are you going to get a wife? It's not a good time for that anymore. Surviving, getting lucky, that's what band leaders don't do. Yumiko-san and her family moved to a new house in Denenchofu. That's right, I've got a photo for you. Yes, thank you. I just sent out another reminder letter yesterday. He didn't want to send it because he thought they looked weird. Oh, it's not weird at all. Look,Mom. Isn't it nice? Komaki-san seems a little shy. Oh, come on in. You chose 'Carmen' after all? Yes. After all, the performance location is Shanghai. We had a lot of discussions. Oh, welcome back. Oh, why the treat today? Because today is our anniversary, right? Oh yeah I couldn't help myself. Are you hungry? It's almost ready. No time to eat though. I'm very busy. I'm sorry for wasting your hard work. When will you be back? I don't know. Bye. Wait. Your shoelaces are untied. Thank you. Here's a ticket to the Fujiwara Opera Company. Go tonight. It'll be nostalgic. Please take care of yourself. Did you reach Chizu-san? No, I couldn't reach her on the phone. I hope she will come today. Look for her in the audience. I'll be sure to ask you later. Yumiko-san. Visitors. It must be Chizu-san. Good to see you, Kawakami-san. It has been a while. I didn't know you were in Shanghai. Oh, Komaki doing well? Yes, thanks. He misses you. If he knew you'd be here, he would have come with me. Oh, I see. Together. I can see things are going well for you two. Hee-haw, hee-haw. No, it's 'ahh'. Right, teacher? Ma'am. Your husband called. He left a message. He said to tell wife that he can't come home tonight. I told him yes and he hung up. Yes. Thanks. I am pleased to announce the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy.

I called you so much, but you didn't even see the play. I'm sorry. If you hadn't made it here today, I was going to visit your apartment. Your enthusiasm is embarressing me. Because... I wanted to see you, and I couldn't stand it. That's me, alright. But... What's this about the Tripartite Alliance? Excuse me, ma'am. They are an excitable people, aren't they? If I had to worry about every little thing like that, I wouldn't be able to live here in Shanghai. It must be frustrating. More than I can say. Hey, Chizu-san. Will you ever come back to Japan? I'm begging you. Fujiwara-sensei still talks about you from time to time. Couldn't you meet and talk? I knew that when I saw you, you would bring this up. But I'm still going to do what I want. Not out of stubbornness like before. I just want to experience new things. Hagiwara-san, how is he? Hagiwara? The same, I guess. I'm sorry. The life we have now. I can't say more. I feel like a child in front of you. I'm trying to live life to the fullest. I know. I know very well. Yumiko-san, if what I said has upset you, I apologize. After all, I'm kind of confused, too. Bumped into too many things. It will show up in your words and demeanor. Let's get out of here. Otherwise, we'll never stop talking. Boy? Oh, I... It's okay. I'll take care of the Shanghai currency. Wife. Hagiwara's wife. Husband, hard, hard. No, no. At hospital. Which hospital? Koike Hospital. In the fall of 1940, came the song "2600 Years Since the Founding" (Kigen Nisen Roppyaku Nen) written by Yoshio Masuda and composed by Gihachirō Mori ♪ Shining the golden kite of Japan receiving the glorious light ♪ ♪ Now is the time to celebrate this morning ♪ ♪ The year is 2600 ♪ ♪ Ah, of the 100 million, the hearts are burning ♪ ♪ Overflowing with delight, ♪ ♪ this ground we stand on it firmly ♪ ♪ We look up from afar to the Emperor's words ♪ ♪ The year is 2600 ♪ ♪ Ah, the founding country's clouds are blue ♪ I can't believe Hagiwara-san passed away like that. It must have been really hard for you. After I started working for the Special Agency, I gave up my old life a long time ago. I didn't know. It's just that I'm in charge of the band. Japan with Jazz. I used to do that too. When we were in Shanghai. What do you think we saw? It was horrible. Jazz is the cultural violence of America. When we were students, I often heard that Shanghai was cosmopolitan. It was like having an exotic dream. But Shanghai was more than that. On a sunny morning, the flags of the United States, the United Kingdom, and various other countries are mixed together. But they flow in the same direction, fluttering and harmoniously. Oh, it was beautiful. But that's only on the surface. When we were in Japan, we often read in the newspapers about countries which seemed distant and unimportant. I thought it was irrelevant. It wasn't until I went to Shanghai that I realized it. The truths hit you one after the other, blatantly. I guess so. Hagiwara could handle it. That kind of thing was too much for me. Finally, I jumped into the Special Agency. I worked myself to the bone. I had to do it, I couldn't just stay home. That was the atonement for the mistakes we made. We thought you were idiots, after all. I was caught up in the American cultural conspiracy. Oh, Mie-san. Hagiwara-san was killed by the Americans. It must have been frustrating.

I envy you. No, don't tease me like that. No, you've found your happiness. I'm still looking for mine. I don't know what to say. I'm an elementary school song teacher. You're the only one who envies me so much. I really have to treat myself. I'll get ready, so please wait a moment. Come on, let's go. Please excuse me. How come? Nothing has changed. It's just me and my mother. I'm happy just to see you. But I'm on my way to Tokyo now. I want to talk to you some more. About what? Your future. Me? Well, of course, you'll want to talk with Yumiko-san. No, no. I can't talk about this. Not to that innocent Yumiko-san. Then to Fujiwara-sensei? I've given up singing. What, really? I've thrown away everything I've ever owned. The only things I have left from Shanghai are the remains of Hagiwara and a few personal belongings. Then what's next for you? What to do? There's only one way for me to live. Hagiwara had to work hard to make amends I'll do my best, too. I can't let the sadness of the moment get the best of me. Chizu-san. "War in Atlantic worsening" "English reinforce Pacific bases" "Boast ready if attacked" Good new song? You're in a bad mood. Why are you so irritable all the time? I was teased by my sister today. Why? When we got married, Fujiwara-sensei said you were a budding, talented composer. That's why. So what's wrong? She asked what kind of talent is it that doesn't compose at all? That was a terrible thing to say. What did you say? Me? Nothing. Did you feel sorry for me? Yes. It must be frustrating. It is. I am frustrated. We got a postcard from Kawakami-san. Kawakami-san is doing as well as ever, wouldn't you say? "If a War Begins, America Will Be Responsible" "Britain and the U.S. blackmail Japan." "Impending War" "Could Begin Any Time" "Aggressive Offensive Expected Soon" "The Inexplicable Madness of the Anglo-Americans" "English Sending Battleships to Pacific from Mediterranean" "Prime Minister Does Not Change his Perception" "The Pacific Crisis Will Not Go Away" "U.S. Military Offensive Ready" "Army Calls Up More Men" "Resignation of Eastern Army Commander and Military Police Commander" "Japanese and American policies are Totally Opposite" "Low Hopes for Compromise" "U.S. Ignores Diplomatic Conventions!" "No Response After Two Days" "Why Won't They Answer?" December 8th, 1941 We Surprise With Successful Action IMPERIAL FORCES REAP GLOWING RESULTS! It began with an historic surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, and then again off the Malaya coast, where the British Asia fleet was utterly annihilated. In a third strike, Hong Kong, England’s strategic base for its 100-year exploitation of East Asia, fell into ruin in only a matter of ten days. On February 15, the enemy fortress of Singapore vanished into nothingness before the Imperial Forces who penetrated the jungles of the Malay Peninsula then advanced southward like a raging tide. Long live the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! This joy of the day is what I think that this music needs to express. Right. That's exactly how I feel, too. Can you do that? Somehow, I feel like I can do it. Today, my own emotions, I want to make it into a song. I have never felt this kind of emotion for a song before. I used to just calmly looked at it from the outside and created it but couldn't find any reason. True. But you're not the only one. All the so-called intellectuals tend to do that. I woke up to the war. It was late. But not too late. Let's stop reasoning and jump in. Oh, yes. You have changed. It's not that I changed, but I know now what I need to do. Let's do it. I will do it this time. All it took was the fall of Singapore. Yeah, well. What I am aiming for is music for working, so to speak. Kozo Kawakami is a good example for me. He's a military band leader. The head of the labor department at this mine is a friend from junior high school. I came here to learn. For the sake of my country, I went to the mines. When I see these mountain warriors, I pray for their safety from the bottom of my heart. I can't help but ask them to do their best. I sometimes think about expressing this feeling in a song. The appearance of the strong production increase in the pit will wash away the old grime from my body and heart. So that we won't be defeated, Komaki-kun. Let's do our best for Japan. I'll do it. I'll do my best.

I was so worried. Thank you. I was worried about you, too. About me? Since we parted in Shanghai, the world has changed. I was wondering how you are doing. The ones you were worried about were the same ones worried about you. The world is completely turned upside down these days. But, Sensei, it's really good that you've moved on. For us, above all. This kind of comfort makes me the happiest. Are you all happy with that? Yes, that's right. Well, I'm glad. I have to start work. Well then, let's do our best together. Sensei, please come again. Please do your best. Take care. Well, then. I've changed. I've really changed. I see that very clearly today. I always tell Komaki that you are insensitive. You're mad at me for being absent-minded. I have to think about it more. That's right. You have to be aware of that in every single song. Oath: We are industrial warriors. We are industrial warriors.

"We need more COAL" Yumiko-san! Well, Mie-san. It's been a while. Really, quite a while. I've been looking for you for a while. You've become a country girl. When did you get here? Yesterday. I've been taking care of children of bereaved families at school. That's great. Almost finished. Just give me a minute. Yumiko-san, you're doing your own laundry. Don't say such things so loudly. Even I can't stay a young lady forever. What about Komaki-san? He's here. He just got home from the mine this morning. This laundry was a souvenir. Oh, dear. Someone special is here. Hey, welcome. It has been a while. A while. In fact, shortly after arriving at the inn last night, I received this telegram from my mother, as if chasing after me. What is it? What is it? What? Kawakami died on the battlefield? I'm sorry, Komaki-san. I know two were close. Kawakami-san dead? It's so sudden. So ironic. I got a postcard from him just this morning. I was writing a reply to it just now. What did the postcard say? He said he had malaria which seemed to be getting worse. It was because of his illness. I never thought that postcard would be the last. Slaughter all enemy aircraft carriers and battleships. Wipe out all vicious Americans and Britons. These mountains must be our foes' tombs. This is amazing. You finally have a masterpiece. Don't you think, sir. Yes, it's splendid. In memory of Kawakami, I want to title it "Song of Destruction of the United States and Britain". Yes. A song about the destruction of the U.S. and Britain. Great title. The day after tomorrow, there will be a send-off radio music concert for all the students going off to war. Let's debut this song then. This song is perfect for that. For the young men and women leaving school, abandoning their pens to wield guns to destroy the U.S. and Britain. I'll be there. This is going to be splendid. Say, let's ask Yumiko-san on behalf of women. I'd like to have Mie-san and Chizu-san come too. Yes. You all sing together. But will Chizu-san sing? Yes, you said she quit singing. Yes, but this time I think she will listen to me. Five years have passed. The three of us have walked different paths, but we have all arrived at the same place. I think the feelings of the three of us are the same as in this song. I am confident this time I can convince Chizu-san. It feels like only a few days ago that we took this picture, not five years. Compared to then, we and the world have changed a lot. You're the only one who hasn't changed. You'll always be in a daze. Oh, no. I've changed, too. Chizu-san used to tease me about my naivete but I don't seem that way any more, do I Chizu-san? It's true. I never imagined Yumiko-san doing laundry. She really is a good wife. I'm sorry, Yumiko. I've been too stubborn in the past. I've been too backward. When you told me that our current feelings were the same as this song about the destruction of the U.S. and Britain, I was at a loss to know how to apologize to you for my past rudeness. Oh, that's alright. More importantly, you will sing with us, won't you? Yes. Yes, I will gladly sing with you. A song of the destruction of the U.S. and Britain. I'm sure Hagiwara-san would be very pleased. He would. Let me sing with you, too. When I told other teachers about this song, they said the children must learn it so we can all sing along. Yes, I'm happy for you. Hey, Chizu-san. Would you take this opportunity to sing again? I know you have a lot going on at one time but my hope is to have someone like Chizu-san sings it first. The songs you sing are true labor music. I agree. You should be the first to sing it at work. Chizu-san, I'll ask you to do the same. Yes, I will do it. I kind of feel like I can sing with a lot of pride. Thank you. Now I have another friend. In exchange, I'll quit the opera company. You? Why? There is someone I'd like to see take over. Who could follow in your footsteps? My own sweet apprentice. A child. A baby. Well! Congratulations, Yumiko-san. Congratulations. Congratulations, Komaki-san. Congratulations! I know. I can't stay on the stage. I'm going to sing a lullaby. I'll sing with my kids. Be a good mother. Yes, you will. So this song about the destruction of the U.S. and Britain will be the last one. Yes. It's a good end.
