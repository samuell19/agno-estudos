[music playing] OK, Johnny. I'll tell her. They're coming to get you, Barbara. Thanks, sugar. See ya. I'll see ya later. Did you read the papers? Bodies are piling up. Everyone's a suspect. I'll have the, uh, redrum. OK. I too shall have the redrum. Coming right up. Garcon? Coffee. That's some bad hat, Harry. They're only noodles, Michael. Coffee, sir? Yes, please. Here's a few creams for you. So, Jo, um-- we need to talk. Thank you. You're welcome. About what? Well, we've been seeing each other for a while, and it's been great. It has been, hasn't it? Yeah. Um-- I feel like you've been paying too much attention to me lately. How can I be paying too much attention to you? All right, let's be honest. You contact me nonstop. I can't even take a shower without you calling me, asking me where I'm at, who I'm with, what are you doing. You're smothering me, all right? I-- I just can't take it anymore. I want to see other people. You can't be serious? It's over, Jo. We're done. Don't contact me. Don't call me. Nothing. Chris, please! Don't. I'm moving on. You need to do the same. We'll all be corpses soon. [heavy breathing] [guitar playing] TV: Gang, we have work to do. She's got blue diarrhea. [doorbell] What the hell? Stay here. Who's there? [screaming] Close your eyes, and count to 100. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. 10. 11. Home sweet home. Home sweet home. Can you please hurry up and open the door? We'd have been home at least 15 minutes ago if you would have fixed that stupid car. Wonder how Danny's doing with the new babysitter? I'm sure everything's fine. But you know how he is. I have to pee like crazy. You've got the bladder of a teacup chihuahua. Yeah, Gerry? Well, you know what? It's a long walk, and the ladies' room in that restaurant was absolutely disgusting. You should see the mens' room. Oh! My gosh. Ugh. I told Danny not to leave his stuff laying around. Danny! I don't know. I don't know. Something doesn't feel right. I'm going upstairs. Whoa. Why? To get my gun. Whoa! To get your what? Forget the gun. Let's just find Danny. Well, you'd better find a flashlight, too. All right, I'm going to look around upstairs. You check out around down here. Fine. Danny! Why would he come down here? Beth! Danny! Are you down here? This is absolutely ridiculous. There it is. Kat, is that you? KAT: Yeah! It's me! Breakers were off. GERRY: Did you get 'em all? I think so! Working on it. Beth? Beth? Beth? Beth? Gerry! Gerry! Gerry, I need you! What's wrong? It's Beth. It's Beth. How is she? How is she? She's not breathing. What do you mean, she's not breathing? Gerry! Gerry! [growling] Where's your gun? Gerry! Oh my god! Where are you? Oh my god! [heavy breathing] Gerry! Gerry! [gunshot] Gerry! Gerry? It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Gerry? Gerry! Please-- don't leave me. No. No. No. No. No. No. Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny! Where are you, Danny? [hard rock music] Shit, I can't listen to this shit anymore. Me, neither. You don't seem too worried about Darren. Isn't he still in the city? Daryl. And we broke up two weeks ago. He moved to Florida before all this shit happened. I think he's still light in his loafers. He could probably fly there. Yeah, see, I'm trying to get the fuck outta here, and get in some booze. God fucking dammit! Now what? We walk. Grab the gas can out of the back. Hopefully we'll have some daylight left. Man, I could really use a fucking drink right about now. Hey, man! You got any gas? My truck broke down. You know, with all this crazy shit going on. Hey, you deaf? You have any gas? The fuck's this guy's problem? Maybe he can't hear us? [growling] [screaming] Dad! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck! Help! Help! Is anybody home? Open up! Hello? Open up! Help! Well, now. Who are you? And what is it you think you're doing in my house, uninvited? Albert. I'm Albert. There are people outside, but-- they're not people. Explain. One of those things attacked my dad. He's dead. He's dead. Oh, god. He's dead. I just shot and killed something, or someone because it attacked my husband. And ate him! Like a ravenous animal. I need to know what you know. Now! Listen. I'm unarmed. Just-- just-- put the gun away. And we can talk. Danny? You stay on that couch. And don't you open this door. Come with me. Albert. Oh my god. This is your husband? He was. That's the thing that killed him. That's the babysitter. Gerry, uh-- he had me go get his gun when he got attacked, and-- those eyes. I-- all I can remember are those eyes. And then it snarled at me, and I blew his head off. I'm sorry. I-- [coughing] What the fuck is going on? It's-- it's like these things have some kind of fucked up rabies, or something. You're kidding, right? You saw the same thing I did. That wasn't human. It was-- that was something different. All I know is it killed my husband, killed the babysitter, and it would have killed me. I just thank God that Danny was able to go and hide. Who's Danny? We need to go upstairs. So, I'm Albert. [static] You're Danny. [static] What's your name? I'm Katrina. [snarling] How on earth did you end up here? My father and I were driving out of the city when we heard some scary broadcasts. Uh-- the CDC was going on about some sort of strain of Ebola, or rabies. They kept saying it had a bad effect on people. I guess they were right. That thing killed my father. Look-- you're safe for now. But I'm gonna be perfectly honest with ya, I don't know how long we're gonna hold up here. I saw some of those things coming this way. They were all over the woods. Those things are nasty, but they're stupid. Maybe we can stay here until we find somewhere safer? Yes, of course you can. [banging] WOMAN: Somebody please-- Hey, babe? I'm home. Since when do we leave our dirty clothes lying on the floor? [groaning] Hey. Hey, is everything all right? Sarah? [crying] What's going on? I don't know! What the fuck happened to your wrist? A little girl-- a little girl-- What little girl? A little girl next door. She bit me. Fuck. We need to get you to a hospital. [clattering] What the fuck was that? It was probably just Benjamin. It's OK. Everything's gonna be fine. I'm gonna put this on your wrist. No. We don't want this to get infected. OK, babe? [crying] Fuck. All right. Everything's gonna be fine. [clattering] I think there's someone in the house. OK, babe. Babe, it's-- it's OK. It's OK. Just keep pressure on this, OK? Everything's gonna be fine. I promise. I'm gonna go check things out. Just-- shh. OK? Benjamin? Is that you, Benjamin? Here, kitty, kitty. You fucking bastard! Benji? What did he do to you? Jill-- Jill? Jill? Oh my god! Jill! What is that thing? No! No! Get off! Get off! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go, go, go, go! Ah! No! Baby, help me! Please! Help me! Help me! [screaming] Shit! Fuck! Come on. [groaning] [screaming] Help! Help! Help! Please, somebody, help me! Help! Please! Open it. Calm down. It's OK. Come in. [inaudible] What's your name? I'm Jill. Jill Solomon. I'm Albert. That's Danny, that's Katrina. This is her house. Mom? Is everything OK? Everything's fine, sweetheart. Please just get me a drink of water. Yeah. Jill, so, why don't you, uh, explain exactly how you got to my house. Well, you know how people on the streets started acting strange? I don't know where I'm going, or how I'm supposed to get there. All I knew is that I had to get as far as fuck away from the city as I could. Thank you. Jill, I'd like you to meet my son, Danny. Nice to meet you, Jill. It's nice to meet you, Danny. Thanks for this. You're welcome. You still haven't told us how you got here. Sorry. I started hitchhiking. Then I started walking. Last night, it got to the point where I thought I couldn't walk anymore. So I broke into what I thought was an abandoned garage. I tried to sleep for the night. [snarling] [heavy breathing] [snarling] [screaming] This infection, or whatever it is-- it attacks their brains. Possibly even destroys them. All they want to do is eat, and all they want to eat is us. Cool. We should board up these windows. Son of a bitch. My second day on the job, and not one damn call. Maybe if the precinct was actually staffed right, I'd have a partner. But no! RADIO: We have a [inaudible]. RADIO: Yeah, and [inaudible]. Looking out at the-- 10-4. [radio chatter] What the-- what-- what's going on? [engine running] [knocking] DEARBORN: Open up! Open up! Police! Open up! All right. All right. Who are you, and what the hell is going on out there? We don't know. We just sort of-- ended up here. What the fuck does that mean? Look, you want to put the gun away? I'll put it away when I feel like it, son. Officer, please-- we have enough to concern ourselves with. I said, I will put it away when I feel like-- You! Put the gun away. You're scaring my son to death. OK. I'm Albert, and like I said, we don't know each other. A little while before I got here, my father and I were having some car trouble until we were attacked by some-- infected person. I don't know, but it kind of looked like a zombie. You're seriously talking to me about zombies right now? I don't know. All I know is what I saw. Look-- I'm sorry, but my patrol car's sitting at the bottom of the hill right now with busted tires, and god knows what the fuck else is wrong with it. And on top of that, there's a group of weirdos trying to kick my ass, and you want to talk to me about motherfucking zombies right now? What the fuck is wrong with you, queer boy? Do you not know what I've been through? Dude-- I was sitting in my car, taking a littlep nap, and then when I woke up, I had no idea what was going on. Started up, the lights came on, and there he was! He just jumped on the hood, and started clawing at the windows. And then I had no idea what the hell was going on. So I took it, threw it in reverse-- and then-- the tire got stuck. It just kept spinning. It just kept spinning! It was like-- from a fucking movie! You! Seriously. Keep your voice down. There's something in the basement that I think you should see. Follow me. [retching] This is Officer William Dearborn, car number 052. Officer in need of emergency assistance off of Huntington Road. Do you copy? This is Officer Dearborn. Do you copy? [static] Repeat! Officer in need of emergency assistance. Marty, where the fuck are you? [static] God dammit! Will someone answer me? I swear to god, he better not be fucking with me right. They're not going to answer you. Shut up, bitch. No one asked you anything. Do you copy? There's no one there, Dearborn. We've heard all the broadcasts. Any police officers are either dead or protecting their families. What makes you think that they're going to stick around just to save you? Quit it with the fucking crazy talk. I'm not so quick to believe in some kind of zombie apocalypse, so I want all of you to stay where you are until I get help! Marty, where the fuck are you? Whether you want to believe this or not, this is actually happening. People are running, hiding, dying! If you go outside, they're going to catch you. They're going to kill you. And then they're going to eat you. Shut the fuck up, you crazy-- Now get the fuck up. Now! Now go to the corner with your face in the wall. What are you doing? You know what I'm doing. It's for your own good. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I need to use the bathroom. Where is it? It's upstairs. Second door on your left. Thank you. [gunfire] Hot in there, wasn't it? Oh, you'd better believe it. I was sweating my balls off. Go on, get out. I think I know that guy. Hm? What's his name? Steve Johnson? Johnson, huh? Where'd you meet him at? High school? I had gym class with him. Should have seen that guy. So did your dad ever take you fishing? My dad's dead. Oh my god. Danny-- I'm so sorry. I didn't-- It's OK. Sometimes I wish I was dead, too. Hey, guys. Right. So, do you have any plan on getting out of here? No. Not yet. Well, it's time you start thinking. You know we can't stay here forever. Do you have any suggestions? Well, for starters, I suggest you get me out of these cuffs. No fucking way. My patrol car is at the bottom of the hill right now. It has a shotgun, and an emergency kit with a detailed pilot map of the local town and surrounding areas. Al, what are you doing? It's OK. He's in the same position as we are. He's not going anywhere else. And plus, I've got his gun. Are you ready to play nice? Nice? That's for faggots. So, how do you want to do this? Is there any police scanner or TV working in the house right now? TV's down. That's about it. Landlines? No, there isn't any landlines. And our cell phones have no service here. All right, this is what we need to do. Some of you can come with me down to my car. One of you can stay here and watch the kid, and the other two can cover my ass while I pull shit out, and then we'll haul ass back up here. OK. I'll go with you, then. Anybody else? Nobody is staying here with Danny except me. Jill, how about you? You up for it? I'll go. Cool. Our guns stay here. What? Are you nuts? Listen, the last thing we need is for a bunch of those things to go apeshit on us because we decided to go Butch and Sundance outside. If the guns aren't coming with us, what do we use to protect ourselves? [clanging] I think I could do, like, 120 push ups. Poindexter! Oh, no! Look out! He's gonna get me. He's gonna get me. Hey, T-Bone. Take a picture. [gunshot] Get this off my fucking face! Come get that out of my eye. -Calm down. Calm down. -Does it-- Yo, don't-- yo, close your eyes. Keep your eyes closed. Keep your eyes closed. Here. Here, here, here. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good, man. Give me that. Be more careful next time. What's wrong with you? Are we ready to do this? Ready. Ready. Guys, be careful. ALBERT: We will. Don't do anything stupid. Don't do anything that'll get me killed. Yeah, yeah. Just go, hatchet boy. Come on. Let's go. [screaming] [snarling] [shouting] Help me! [screaming] What happened? Where's Al? Where's Al? Jill! Dearborn locked the door. Dearborn locked the fucking door! What happened? Dearborn locked the fucking door! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? I need a first aid kit! OK! Look at me. Look at me. You are going to be OK. OK? Uh-- uh-- I need that first aid kit now! KAT: I'm coming! Here. here. Here. Dearborn, I need your help! I don't know what the fuck I'm doing! That's not my fucking problem! You're gonna get over there, and you're gonna fix her fucking leg! Why should I do it? She's the one that fucked herself up! You know what? I might be gay, but you're being a fucking faggot right now! Oh, go fuck yourself! Now fix her fucking leg! Mom? Yeah? Do you think I'm going to die? Maybe. Look, OK-- come here. Listen, buddy. Here. I know I wasn't there to protect your dad. And I know I wasn't there to protect your step-dad. Or the babysitter. But I am here to protect you, right here, and right now. And I will die before I let anything happen to you. OK? Now go get that bag. You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are gray. When skies are gray. You'll never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away. I love you. Oh, baby, I love you. [heavy breathing] Mind if I come in? No. I was about done, anyway. My mom just wanted me to get some stuff for Jill's leg. Do you really think she'll be OK? Honestly-- I don't know. All I keep thinking about is of her becoming one of those things, but-- for all I know, she'll be fine, and we'll be able to get someplace safe. But what if she really does become one of them? Look-- Danny, I-- I'm so sorry that you had to be involved in all of this, after everything that you've seen. The most important thing is that we stay calm, and we stay together Our lives depend on it. Look-- what I mean is I like you, Danny, and I want you to promise me that no matter what happens, you will take care of yourself. Your mom, and all of us-- we can take care of ourselves, but it's very, very important that you look after yourself. I'll do everything that I can for you, but in the end, you have to help yourself. OK? Promise me. OK. I promise. In case you were wondering, no, I haven't picked anything up yet. Both bands? Both bands. You can try and throw me over the couch again and find out for yourself, if you don't believe me. Keep your voice down. We're in this situation together, whether you like it or not-- so when don't you try to be a little bit more cordial until we're under some more favorable conditions? There's an airfield 9 miles southwest of here. It's small, but it should be well enough equipped. There's a helipad in the northeast corner, so I would assume there's a chopper there, too. It's almost morning, so I say we take the day to get ready, and we make our move at night. The dark should be able to help us keep our cover-- keep our distance from those things. With the guns we can make it. Might even be able to use the flares to distract them. That's-- that's actually not a bad idea. My thoughts exactly. If it's that small, they, uh-- they might have some kind of light aircraft. I did some amateur flying in college, and I might be able to get us off the ground. That's cute, if you weren't already talking to a certified pilot. Serious? As serious as cancer. Used to be in the Air Force. You know, working on engines, test piloting. I was discharged when I fucked my hand up on a Herrier engine. Figured I'd do something simpler, like being a cop. I see. You're just full of surprises, Dearborn. I have my moments, boss. Listen, it's pretty late. We should probably go to bed. I was thinking the exact same thing. Are you going to go to sleep? No. I'm too wired. But why don't you go lie down? I'll-- I'll get you up in a few hours. OK. I'll see you in the morning, then. See you in the morning. Seal it off here, here, and here. I want you to double the guard here, because this is where they got in last time. On the left side, or the right flank? The right flank. Consider it done, sir. This is some real end of the world shit, man. What makes you say that? It's the freaking apocalypse. There's zombies all over the place. Zombies, Evans? Really? You believe in zombies? Yeah. I shot this one thing, like, 12 times in the chest the other day. And that thing just kept on walking towards me. What kind of-- First of all, I know your version of 12. It was probably two. Second of all, there's a lot of mysteries things in this world we don't get. One thing I'd tell you is there ain't no such thing as zombies. [groaning] No! Help! Help! No! Leave me alone! Who are you? Who are you? Help! [screaming] What the fuck? Get the fuck up, Al. What? Now, I don't want to hear a motherfucking peep out of any of you. Now, here's the deal. Dearborn, what the fuck are you doing? I said, shut the fuck up. I'm leaving. If you, or anyone else moves, I swear to god, I'm gonna kill you motherfucking all. Motherfucking right. Get it? You crazy bastard! Fuck-- I've got you at point blank, motherfucker. [gunshot] [gunshot] [shouting] Thanks for, uh-- letting me wear your husband's clothes. Not a problem. Is he OK? I don't know. I don't know. Danny, why don't you, uh, help your mom, and keep her company? OK. Come on. Take care, all right? OK. How are you doing? I'm perfect. Can't you tell? Everybody's doing everything they can for you. I know. Is there anything I can get you? Can you grab my pills out of my jacket pocket? Sure. Make sure we get that perimeter locked down. We don't want those things getting in here. Yes, sir. Consider it done. [growling] [snarling] 9:00 we're going to head southwest. We'll keep a bunch of flares handy, just in case we get ganged up, and we'll throw one, and we'll run like hell. But there's only two left, so be smart with them. Wait a minute. What are we gonna do about Jill? She can't walk. And we sure can't carry her, with everything else, and run. I was thinking about that. I, uh-- I thought I saw a wheelbarrow on the side of your house when we were running to Dearborn's car. Yeah, I have one. It's out by my water hose. Well, that'll have to do. We can put her in the wheelbarrow, and she can cover us with the shotgun. Danny, I think you should take this. I think you've earned it, and you should get familiar with it. Just in case we get into a tight situation, you're going to need to be as useful as you can. You got it? I got it. Cool. Now, we're going to need to stay tight. That means staying sharp, and keeping a close eye on the surroundings. Katrina, I want you to hold the flares, and just in case we get ganged up, I want you to light one and throw it as far as you can, and we'll run like hell. Danny, you can just follow behind me and Jill until we haul ass to the airport. Did I forget anything? You remember what that guy was talking about back there? Which guy? The big fella. The one with the lazy eye? Naw, his friend. Talking about the diseased monkeys. Now, what kinda monkey has diseases? That don't make no sense. Rabies? Scabies? AIDS? AIDS? Reagan invented AIDS. Everybody knows that. You're right. [growling] You got him. You got him. [gunshot] Hey, buddy. Hey. You're being a really good listener. Thank you. You need to stay out here, and just read your comic book, all right? OK. All right? Jill's trying to sleep right now, so you gotta be really quiet. Can you do that? Mm-hm. OK. I love you. OK. Me and Al will be right in the kitchen if you need me. OK. OK. Hey there. What are you doing in here? I don't know. Just curious? I guess. You're really good to your mother. You know that, right? I try to be. She hasn't been very happy lately. I'm really sorry to hear that, Danny. Sometimes life can be a bitch. Do you have a dad? I used to. He left my family when I was about your age. Do you remember him? No. This all reminds me of my favorite movie. Yeah? What's that? "Terminator 2." The one with the liquid terminator. He's bad ass. Of every movie ever made, "Terminator 2" is your favorite? Well, I'm not big on musicals, and I like to think "Terminator 2" wins above Star Wars. And Star Wars wasn't as good as Sergio Leone's Man With No Name trilogy. It's amazing. Sounds like your dad taught you a lot. Well, it was either movies or girls, and girls tend to be far less entertaining. [coughing] Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. What do you remember about the night that your father died? There's not a whole lot to remember. It was about mid summer, and me and my dad were watching an old comedy. The doorbell rang. My dad went to go see who it was. And before I knew it, he was lying on the ground, covered in blood. Did you see who did it? Kind of. It was a woman. How do you know it was a woman? I saw her. Danny, I have something to tell you. It was me. I'm sorry, Danny. I've missed you, Danny. You killed my dad? [shouting] [groaning] [gunshot] [gunshot] Danny? Danny? Danny? Danny? What have you done? I got her, Mom. I got her. What are you talking about? She's the one who killed Dad. I got her. What? She knew everything about it. It was her. Danny, do you know what you have done? [glass shattering] ALBERT: They're coming in. We have to go. Danny, grab your pistol and be ready to shoot! We have to go now! [groaning] Run! [gunshot] Leave it! Leave it! No! Leave it! [gunshot] [gunshot] Danny? Danny? Danny? No! Danny! -Come on! -Danny! We can't leave him! Danny! Danny, no. Danny! Shh, shh, shh. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine, and he's gonna be OK. Got it? [gunting] That was my dad. Huh. Weird day. [growling] [shouting] [shouting] [shouting] [shouting] [gunshot] Danny? Danny, come here. We gotta go. Let's go! Ah! [gunshot] [screaming] [sobbing] [crying] Danny? [gunshot] You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You take care, now. You take care. [inaudible]. Don't ever go away. No. Al. Don't let anything happen to him. Take care of him. You run. You go. And don't look back. Take him. Promise me you won't let anything happen to him! I promise. I promise! Go. Go. Go! I love you, Danny. I love you, Danny! Go with Al! Go! You be good to him! [screaming] Danny! [screaming] [music playing] SINGER: I know not all the colors inside, in the forest I so did reside. In the brightest place, her body would give in. But under my feet blows that sweet, sweet August wind. Hey, come on. Albert, come on. Albert. Get up. SINGER: I would climb these walls, and now won't you let me in? But under my feet blows that sweet, sweet August wind. Yeah, under my feet blows that sweet, sweet August wind. [gunshot] Oh, man. Crazy Horse, did you see this? He was a ring-a-ding-dinging, and coming right at me. The boy was licking his lips, and everything. I seen. He was an ugly bastard, too, huh? I shot right in his face. Let me just-- let's go on him. Oh, man. He got the disease real bad. Monkey must have just bit this one. All right, let's check him. Come on. Let's see what he's got on him. Fuckin' something here. SINGER: But deep in my soul lies that sweet, sweet August rush. Yeah, deep in my soul lies that sweet, sweet August rush. Danny, come on. We gotta keep going. We've been walking for days. And we gotta keep walking. Come on. Hey. I'm really sorry about your mom. Me too. She was a great woman. I know. Hey. You still got me. I'm not going anywhere. Have you ever skipped rocks before? Come on. I don't think that you know what you're missing. Oh-- wanna try? You want a rock that's nice and flat. Like this one. All right? And you want to flick your wrist. Like-- with the water, all right? OK. Try it. OK, second time is usually when people get it. Try it. All right. Third time's the charm, if you ask me. Try-- try this one. That one looks awesome. Nice! You got it a little bit. Here. OK. Now, when you start to get really good, you can have a competition, all right? But any good rock skipper knows that you gotta find the rock that is just right for you. OK? Ready? Let's try it. Go for it. -You-- you go first. -Me? OK. You see that? All right. Now, it's time for a competition. OK? OK. [gunshot] We have to go. Sorry. I'm sorry I shot the gun. Do you want a piggy back ride? All right. Hop on. You want the gun? -Mm-hm. All right. Let's go. Danny? The helicopter's heading north. Shit. So we're goin' south, then. Hm. No way, man. He's just another mouth to feed. He's a nine-year-old boy. How much could he eat? Seriously. I said no, T-Bone. Just drop it, man. Damn. Hey, brother, normally I would agree with you, but if we don't take him with us, he's gonna die for sure. Then let him die, then. We can't just rescue every single fucking person we come across out here. Well? Well, what? I don't know. We use him as bait, or something. Nobody uses my son as bait! Alby? Alby! It's all right, Danny. I gotcha, buddy. Get that gun out my brother's back, mister, or I'll fucking end you! I hate to disappoint you, but this isn't the first time I've had a gun pointed at me. Gonna be your last, you don't put it down! Damn, damn, damn. Give me the boy. You first! Damn. Damn. Oh, dammit! [gunfire] Don't do anything stupid, boy! Oh, this is stupid, Crazy Horse. They ain't do nothing wrong. I'll put mine down if you do. You first! God dammit, Crazy Horse! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me, dammit! God! They're not the ones we're looking for! God dammit! Stay to the tracks! You'll last longer! Come on, Albert. Come on. [car engine] Good evening, gentlemen. I think you oughta come with us. Albert? Albert? Alby? Sir, that was intelligence. They found the strain. Patient zero is in Iowa. Get General Ventry on the horn. Have him lock down Iowa. We move in Bravo Team first light. Yes, sir. Yeah! God! You son of a bitch! Woo-hoo!
