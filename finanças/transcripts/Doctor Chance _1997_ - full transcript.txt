Texas Archangel Escort to Beechcraft O-S 100, emit surrender signals. Aircraft carrier runway open at 9 Long. 23,5 Lat. South. Over to you, Beechcraft. Please respond, Beechcraft. I repeat: Texas Archangel Escort to Beechcraft. I am at 3 o`clock. Come in, Beechcraft. You are within firing range. Texas Archangel Escort to Beechcraft. Texas Archangel Escort to Beechcraft. Come in, Beechcraft. The story begins where it all seems to finish. Zelda should`ve been back from Barcelona. We`d have parted at the end of Sunrise. Except that movies work like white magic. Zelda won`t come now What a bitch! Zelda won`t come now. It`s over. I imagine her in a storm, the rain washing her face. You don`t drive faster than the sun anymore. Falling into the flowers and soot. You`re gonna die. Damn you. You said there was nothing to lose but words. But you don`t write anymore. So long. Angstel, this is Satarenko. Don`t ring me at my place. My phone`s being tapped . I wait for your call at 9:00. Use the phone booth. It`s important. You have to finish what you start. Let`s go, Lope has the stuff. Don`t be long. That`s Ancetta. She works here. She costs even more than dope. Bye, I`m staying. Am I buying? I`ll buy... you ! Yeah, I`ll buy ! How much? ? 100. $ 1,000. 10,000 yen. I don`t care. I pay cash. An inheritance from BuenosAires. Marks, pesetas... I hate it when love involves lies. No time left for seduction. Let`s make things simpler. We`ll just talk to say goodbye. We`re in a hurry. Hey, sugar, the show`s at 1:00! It`s a film on love and bombs. Neither pay. Who gives a shit? We`re outta here like bullets from a gun. POW ! You pay a high price. I adore being bought for a high price. I adore you. I need luck on my side. Luck is always on the chicks` side. Like death. Forever? And I pay more and more! Look! I`ll always have plenty ! We`re outta here like bullets from a gun Latest news in ``La Noche``! When fake painting answers to dirty money Gonna be a long night. We`ll be faster than the night! I`ve got the stuff, we`re 2 hours ahead of schedule. No one saw the case? I know my job. I hope so. You`re on your own now. I gotta stay in town. They searched Milady`s house, put seals on the paintings. It`s all been falling apart. The bosses are trying to hang it on me. Tax officials, too. Fanzie`s not clean. You`re my last card. I gotta go. Be careful with the Spaniard. Very careful. When fake painting answers to dirty money Listen! I love this music. Angstel, hi! Asphalt Ogareff ! I`ll buy you a drink. No. I`m trying not to drink I`m finishing my book. Is it because of her? No, I`m in a rush. Writing. No drinking. Taking everything at face value. Becoming pure again. What about Zelda? She betrayed me two times. I forgot the first time. I nearly died. The second time, I realized it was my fault. Being wrong twice is n`t a mistake-- It means you want to die stupid. Love is infinity within the reach of poodles. We`ll get old in the end. Angstel Presley Von Sekt. The son of Elvis Presley himself. I hate this bar, these guys, this neighborhood ! I hate them ! What kind of world is this ? Calm down. I love you. Are you fuckin` that ? You`re a whore. A young whore. I love it, and it makes me tremble. We launder money for Zurich, Sphere No. 2. Art trafficking, soccer, the press, pharmaceuticals, gambling. Milady and Satarenko went too far. Their network`s sinking. So are the banks and museums. The Cartel`s guns are at all our throats. They liquidate us to save the No. 3s: politics and high finance. I expected Satarenko. I`m here on his behalf. You don`t deliver fakes anymore? Got the money? Don`t count it ! There`s 120,000. Hands up ! Come on, get up. Up ! Zurich is out to get Satarenko. I know nothing. We`ve got plenty of time. The border is 3 hours from here. Before then, you`ll know why you exist, and why you happen to be in the wrong place. I`m nothing. The paitings are in the car. Yeah, right. Try to gain time. I`m dreaming. You have to finish what you start. Idiot. I hear the word, ``Havana``. In 9 days, I`m dreaming... The other guy talks, but all I can think of is Ancetta. I`m dying to tell her to keep away from me. The crime world`s after me. All the money I`m throwing at her is just empty promises. You don`t know the PBC. Pasta Basica Cocaina. The PBC Cartel ? Peru, Bolivia, Colombia. You`re walking a tight rope in Sphere No 2. Be a good boy and we won`t eliminate you from the program. Public opinion hates forgers. It hates people playing with their petty secrets ! It`s the same for us. Satarenko is unstitching our linings ! Livingstone and Mendoza knew they were fakes ! You have to finish what you start. We`d have preferred the asshole, Satarenko, in person, but you`ll do. You`re Milady`s son, aren`t you ? What am I doing here ! Asshole ! The pin was still in ! Fear brings bad luck. Art poisoned my childhood ! But this time, I was on the level. In the car are Milady`s and Satarenko`s spoils of war. The canvases have gone ! This idea of going over the border... It`s a mortal image. Look. It`s not a fake. It`s your life running away. Listen to the sound of your blood. It sounds like the icy water in the crapper. Introversion is disgusting. I admire those who don`t think, who act on instinct, almost by chance, who stay in the game even if they don`t know it, who prefer to be betrayed rather than betray, to be left rather than go back on their word. Ancetta is a whore. I`m a killer. Period. There`s no escaping real love. People always talk about it when it`s too late. Going to Victory Lane Victory Lane is an anagram of Vince Taylor. Seen Ancetta ? No, I`m looking for her. I must see her. What`s she doing ? It`s her turn. She`s already late. I`ll wait for her. I must... Work comes first. Why don`t you go downstairs ? What you need is the final cut ! 30 seconds... You don`t seem to understand. Look at me . Don`t forget what you promised me. Some people wonder if life has any meaning or not, which is the same as wondering if it`s bearable. That`s when the problems stop and resolutions begin. It`s really too much. The arms business is screwed up. They ruin it with their fake end-users When the shit hits the fan, they want us to pay. If I`d known, I wouiln`t have called you tonight. Of course Livingstone and Mendoza knew they were fakes. It was in the contract with the Yankee museums: dump the fake shit in the form of donations . Declaring a million for a fake at 50,000. Yes . Send him up. Fanzie Dupont. I`ll handle this. It`s war. Zurich wanted to trap Angstel. They don`t know the Spaniard`s dead. They do. I just spoke to Burgen. This is more complicated than it seems. The Swiss propose a truce. Gang warfare doesn`t appeal to them. There`s 9 days left before Havana. They want to make a deal regarding the trial. They`ll give us more time if we hand over a first-rate witness. I know you`ll refuse, but it`s essential we at least pretend to comply, just to gain time. Angstel, it`s after 3:00. You must be tired. You should go to bed. Rest while you can. I`ll wake you at sunrise. We`ll need 9 days to clean our own ranks. I see you still suspect Milady. I`m off to Montezador. I`ve got 120,000 more. Don`t say a word. Milady will change it into smaller bills. She`s still my mother. She can`t refuse. At 5:00, we head back north. No ! Gibraltar ! No ! Anyway, we`ll start over ! It`s for good I`ll be right down. We need to talk ! I`ve got $ 120,000 in large bills. My pockets are stuffed with drugs. I need you. Only you. I nearly paid for Satarenko, I took out the Spaniard. Now Fanzie wants me. Satarenko won`t stop him. He`s nothing anymore. He won`t stop him. Milady! It`s 10 to 4:00, honey. You should sleep here. We`ll talk tomorrow. No, I need you now. Bruce will wake me at 7:00 in the Carrera. He doesn`t know I`m here. It`s all gonna blow tonight. I`m leaving the network. It`s your turn to pay. Change the Spaniard`s 120,000 into smaller bills at 5 to 1. That`s fair. Dream on, honey. I`m exhausted. I`m sick of all your crap. My head feels it`s in a vice. I`m just a killer to be terminated, when my thing was to be a writer ! CUT ! (one more time) Honey, you really should stop the cocaine ! ``Honey, you really should stop the cocaine!`` Is that all you can say ? Keep your fake bills and canvases, your fake love, and give me 25,000. Okay ? Honey, you should go to bed. You`re repeating your self. There are times I understand Zelda. Milady, put another record on. I couldn`t resist seeing you again, Miss. I was already under your spell. Mr. Satarenko convin. There`s no doubt: you`re a resourceful woman. That`s one thing sorted out. I`m delighted. But I think you could shed more light on our business. Mother dear, you`ve stopped quoting people. ``Brute force can not be controversial, nor can insanity be satirical.`` ``The world has a new form of beauty: speed.`` ``Art is dead.`` You turned emotional black mail into a principle. You`re nothing but a fury. You`re old. The era isn`t behind the times anymore - you are ! I`m a writer, not a forger ! Dance, Mommy, dance ! Dance ! Dance ! Dance ! I pay. I pay for you who I love so. And it sure costs me ! You`re sick, Angstel. $ 25,000 are glistening between your thighs. You want to do what Zelda did ? Quit the game ? I dare you ! 25,000 ! Cash ! It`s your fault. It`s your fault... It could`ve been something above this world. I want to see Dr. Couturier again. We had fun with him. He was a forger... and an artist. Sewed fake hymens on Muslim chicks, called himself Couturier on an Argentinean passport. He could turn a whore from Regatta into an Islamic virgin in one night. I`m off to Buenos Aires. The trip costs $ 25,000. I don`t have $ 25,000. I`ll have to call Bruce. I`m not lying. And the rest ? You`re sick. That all ? There`s only 18,000. I don`t have any more. I`ll take our little secrets. The love letters. The contracts. The certificates. The bank orders. Everything. I love you. I love you... I`ll give it all back. I`ll write to you from Gibraltar. Sorry if I took it all. I`m ill-favored by nature. I`ve been sick for 25 years. I`m in the way. Maybe I`ll write... Literature moves beneath the world. I don`t do things right. The words that come don`t match my thoughts. And that cheapens my thoughts. Fuck it ! I`ll call Zelda ! Hello ? Answering machine ? Hello ? This is Angstel. Answer me ! Answer me ! It`s all on fire ! Answer me, you bitch ! It`s war ! Answer ! I know you can hear me ! OK, here`s the deal. You didn`t come. I went back to Satarenko. The network wants my ass. I wasted one of Burgen`s boys. I robbed my mother ! I`m taking off with a dancer. Wonderful ! I`m going all the way. Good ! It`s all your fault! Hello ? That`s right, forget me ! Oh, shit ! Hello ! Wasted ? I want to speak to Ancetta . No, I`m sure she`s... I`m sure she`s there. With which guy ? You`re lying, asshole ! I`m gonna waste you, you dwarf ! Give me Ancetta ! Give me a chance... or I`ll kill again. Make God`s flesh bleed again. Art trafficking and money laundering... Fanzie Dupont is wanted. Fuck ! Think it`ll be long ? This is too much ! Shut up, asshole ! Georg ! Trakl ! Trakl ! Angstel ! I know what you`re looking for. Wait for me, dead man. I am acomplished. The food of the guilty. ``An enigma: a thought which cannot be explained in words`` COMPLETE WORKS I`m sorry. I was scared you`d never come back. And I`m in pain. Always sound... against the black walls. The wind... alone... of God... Georg`s incredible. A real pharmacist. Always in search of the real mixture. K-128 works miracles for where we`re going. Will it hurt you ? Our race is like that. Weariness. The fading of all our charms. Steel in my forehead, poison in your belly. It`s like Fanzie`s $9,000. That`s how I am. You can`t change it. The 9,000 isn`t to sell you. You`re gonna need it ! It`s to buy you or make you forget me. Take it, and take me as I am. Shall I start first ? Isolde said: "May love come". Tristan said... `` May death come. `` Anyway, I hated the dealers, the collectors... and even the artists. They`re all liars ! Art pissed me off as a child. It`s the most perverse form of adult knowledge. An accumulation of references and codes. Nothing to do with literature ! Literature is a barbarian probe, slicing through all that filthy culture. When they turn out the light, its snout still sniffs at the sunrise. You asleep ? Yes, I`m asleep. We`re at Dietrich`s. We`ll flush ourselves clean, and then we`ll go. We`ll spend two days here. Milady thinks we`re in Gibraltar. Fanzie`s dogs must be there by now. We`re at Dietrich`s. He doesn`t suspect us. He left the network at least 3 years ago. He`s not as dumb as Satarenko. Now he works for Iran. He likes stones and money. With Milady, Satarenko was never able to choose. He`s beaten, a loser, and losers are dangerous. After defeat, you have to continue. Losers lie to survive, kill to forget. Satarenko could`ve been a real painter. He went bad. I didn`t know he was a painter. He was a genius ! If he`d died or quit, people would still say he`s a genius. In `57, Kimpel, the American he`d hyped up, dropped him just before the Biennial. All the galleries followed suit. The Rimbaud of painting got scared. He liked fancy hotels and chicks probably more than painting. That`s not so bad if you admit it to yourself and act accordingly. The problem is, he hid it from himself, he started to lie... to lie to himself. And it all went rotten. All he touched went rotten. He lost his sense of taste ! And away went genius and luck ! His whole life ! Nothing stinks like a beaten artist. To crimes of love... I`ll be off now. The other side of the back isn`t the front. Ancetta ? It`s nothing. The night erases everything. Dona Carolina knows a healer in Punta Del Ferro. Take some more. It`ll do you good. I promise you. At least until Punta. We`ll be there before noon. Dietrich is great. I spoke to Vince. The Dutchman`s waiting for us at the port. Don`t worry. Mr. Von Sekt. Dona Carolina ! No, nothing. You know those guys by the pool last night ? They claim they met us at Runaway Bay. Dona Carolina thinks they`re Secret Service... Incas. OK, I`m going now. I`ll see you at the Winter Garden. I adore you. See you real soon. Those gentlemen... have invited you over. OK, all right. Kid, you have to finish what you start. Understand ? Don`t give up. See you. Yeah, right. Ah, Deitrich ! The Incas know something. Or want me to think so. It`s Runaway Bay again ! You think the Dutchman... ? Of course, Mr. Von Sekt. Please come with me. Only one solution. It`s Dietrich ! You know what our concern is: Couturier`s estate. It`s on both sides of the border by the Panama river. Taylor thinks the Dutchman will do. It`s obvious. I`ll keep them here. Ok, later. It should work. If not, there`s Taylor... Go up north, take the Pontiac. I didn`t want to kill, just hurt, give them awarning. But how can I stop this army of fools ? I`ll go see the Dutchman first. Won`t take long. The healer`s place is right nearby. The Dutchman ? Von Sekt ! The shit hit the fan ! It may already be too late... There`s only... There`s only Vince left. Same again. You son of a bitch ! Asshole ! What`s his problem ? We want some peace. Same again. Pay up. Now clear off, you stink. Clear off ! Clear off ! You stink ! Clear off ! OK, I`ll clear off. They`re all losers. It`s an age of losers. Bullfights for losers. Story of losers. I`m a loser as a writer. If only I was a rock star. When history`s messed up, even eternity stinks. Sir, it`s not your turn. Sir ! You see to your wife ! You look like your clients. Ancetta, open up ! Stay out of it ! Get out ! Now ! You`ll kill her. She`s under hypnosis. Wake her up now. Or I`ll waste you ! I know, we`re gonna die. Stop the car. Let me out. I said, stop ! Take your money ! You`re gonna need it. You`re not worth more. He can`t hear me ! Those canvases in my dressing room... Think how I looked when they saw them ! You and your $ 9,000 ! Let me tell you, I cost a lot more ! It`s $ 2,000 for a night. You`re life`s worth less than the fee for my ass for a week ! Yeah, I`m a whore ! Drive faster. It won`t stop me whoring. Like you say, ``where I want and when I want`` ! You`re like all the others. You lie ! Except that Sir reads serious books. ``Whoever arrives in Hades without being purified and initiated ``belongs in the dung. ``He who has been purified and initiated ``will live among the gods.`` Yeah, right ! Like you say, an empty shell ! You sure are one of the family ! Where does reality end Fedor della Cisteria. The world is perishable... and full of fugitives. And death is miserable. You see, I`m too expensive. And too much of a whore ! You won`t shoot. I will ! And I think you`ll follow me... `til the end. Falling, not falling. Back north. Ripping the sky where words used to glow. When you could still say.. I love you forever, more than life... We`re on the other side How much farther to Castel Rodrigo ? I`m feeling bad. I went wrong. After Guarda, we went back south. We have to wipe out our tracks from Punta. Shit ! Stop this shit ! You`re right, it relieves me, and I love you more and more. It`s killing us... It`s killing us. Shall we go ? Yeah, let`s go. Meet you at the cafe. Can I have some gas ? Only got diesel. Shit ! The Campsa didn`t deliver. They`re run off their feet, what with the king coming. The garrison keeps going out all the time at the moment. We`re out of gas. There`s an inn over there. Hostal de la Reina. We`ll stay there. What a pretty wife you have. Are you on vacation ? We`re on our honey moon. I shouldn`t have taken the mountain road. She`s exhausted. Excuse me. Nationality: German. Born in La Paz ? The lady is from Dresden ? Fedor... Is that Russian ? Yes, originally. Do we pay in advance ? Yes, but we don`t take German money. French or pesos, even checks. I prefer cash. Thank you. We`ll return your passports later. Okay. My wife is going up to her room. I`ll have my breakfast now. Honey, art is dead. The gods are dead. Elvis is rotting. You`re nothing. You`re empty. You`re our son. I think someone phoned for you. She was looking for a young couple. I think that... she`ll call back. We were cut off. It was a woman ? Yes, a Brazilian. We fall asleep with the same secret drug. A lethal dose. The light goes out in her arms. We see the film again. Phosphorus sinking in a lake. It still hurts. Go see. I think it`s Vince. She`s dreaming. Blood colors the leaves. A smell of gasoline. The metal drenched with rain. Just a wall to lean on. A piece of glass in the throat till the blood stops flowing. We empty ourselves of the world and it`s good. Angstel ! Vince Taylor ! I have what you were waiting for. Here, take some now. A mouthful is enough. You`ll see, it`s immediate. I hope it`s not too late. We`ll have to be quick. The Feds blocked San Diego. Get in the Mercedes. I hope you like the place. Mountains... Shangri-la. There were forests everywhere. It all burned. Or sank into the sea. It`s an Indian curse. A curse... Come on ! No overdoses with K 3/9. After 9 mg, the metabolism flips. To the terminus where every one gets off. Milady has the same one. Yes. The fake was in Austin. I prefer it to the version in Vienna. The Hungarians claim Kokoschka only painted one version. That was rock`n`roll ! Below the belt. To the extremities ! They`re the ethics. Don`t let your gonads get you down. Don`t let your gonads get you down. Fever down below... and a cold head ! Half cat... half snake. Cat-snake ! We had a way of slippin` and slidin`, Of overtaking art. It was too much. They wouldn`t let us get away with it. The magic vanished with us. Like a chick going cold in a fag`s arms ! Me ? I never came back from the sky. I was a rock star. You`ll see, behind us, we`ll leave nothing but dust ! To Victory ! Victory ! To Victory ! I`m going to bed, don`t be too long, I don`t like sleeping alone. Did you know that Victory Lane is an anagram ? An anagram of Vince Taylor. We`re in the world`s baggage hold, talking about the sky. Ground-to-ground. Soviet stuff rectified to Yankee standards. The Brazilians brought it up-to-date. And that`s ground-to-air. What shit ! We never should`ve touched this shit. Art ! Look at this photo. Me and the Dutchman. He was 52. Colombia... Mo` Bay... Florida. We buzzed the waves. You need to get some sleep, kiddo. You know the Ghost Riders` arsenal. The route`s plotted ! I have a radio session at midnight. The lady`s waiting for you. God be with you. No, it`s over now. We just need to fuck to make the pain go. Now when you`re scared, I wake up. And then you sense the game`s up. We`re clearing out ! Quick ! I`m pulling the plug on the clinic ! Let`s go ! Your forehead`s bleeding ! I think I got lead in my head ! Head back up north. See you on the Maria Celeste. Oh, what fine things we`ll do now ! Disappear in flight to show that the sky exists. The human race is stopping. If it continues, we`ll say it`s its own fault. Everything starts again.
