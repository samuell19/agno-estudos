We're holding a conference here. What? A conference? What about the sauna? It was supposed to be cheaper if you came before nine o'clock. Take this. I'll arrange the flowers myself. - You are the hostess here today, right? - Hostess... I've volunteered to help. You get paid for it, don't you? It's not your leisure time. Would you be so kind as to provide me with the programs. Say, if you ever intend to help in any other conference, perhaps you could make sure to remember, that the programs should be available before the lecturer arrives. Not this afternoon, not in two hours, but now. Four hundred copies. Go ahead. I want them in fifteen minutes. Well, it's a trifle, isn't it? I've been planning for months to get everything together, only to find out that no one bloody cares! Let the entire conference go the way of all flesh! You'll see. They'll come swarming in soon. What's wrong? It's nothing. Summer proceeding against maturity. Take my worries, take my frailty, accept my great and onerous longing for human company. To become like you, to be like you, so mature, powerful and free. So full of life, of longing. So full of sun and warmth. Is everything well, eager beaver? Are you hungry? You shouldn't go home on your lunch break to cook for me. I have to eat nevertheless, but I'll tell you, I have an idea about this. Cooking should be made simple. Yes, it shouldn't take a lot of time. There's so much else to do that is more important. - Like what? - Studying for example. Night after night after night after night. I get so tired sometimes. I just want to run and hide. The singing is wordless. Who says that maturity is heavy to bear? Freedom without burden. - It was a gift from my mom. It's old. - You're silly, it's supposed to be old. - I can fix it for you if you like. - You can have it. Don't be foolish. You can't give away things like these. Memories from home. - Just take it, if you like it. - Well, it's cute. Isn't it incredible really..? People simply assume that they are right, and then they scold you. Today at work, there was a man who... For how long are you renting the apartment? - What did you say? For how long are you renting the apartment? Until spring. - It's yours... - The table? Yes, sure. You told me you needed a nightstand. You shouldn't give me things all the time. I find it hard to accept so many things. - You remembered... - Oh, it's nothing I can build a new one, in less than an afternoon. - Do you want coffee? - Yes, please. You wanted to borrow my english copy, right? - Yes. What are you reading? Is it french? - Is he married? - That's right. It's so damn french that I can't comprehend half of it. Every week he takes the train to go see his mistress. - Don't say that. - What should I say instead? - His beloved. That's not what it's about. She's his mistress, and every Thursday he goes to see her between four and six. - That word, it sounds so nasty. - Does it? - Don't you like it? - Yes, it's very tasty. Black pudding may not be the most suitable food for a lunch. It's fine. But I'm not very hungry. I don't know why I care about trifles like that. The man who scolded me... - What man? - A crazy man at work. - Did I tell you that he yelled at me? - What did you do? Nothing. That's what's so incredible. He must have mistaken me for someone else. I don't get it. Never accept that kind of treatment. Don't let people step on you, there's nothing to gain by it. You must assert yourself. But, I don't know how. I'm completely exhausted. How many children do you want? - Five. - Me too. - That's ten in total. - Well, why not? - Can you provide for ten? - Sure, my future looks bright. Beware. The whole bundle may become redheads. - You're not a redhead. - No, but my mother is. - I like you. - Do you? What do you like about me? - You! - But more precisely? - I can't tell you. - You must say something. Your hair, the way you walk, your belly. No... - Don't be disappointed in me. - I can't be disappointed in you. - I'm so clumsy. - No, you're not clumsy. - But what is that I'm doing wrong? - You're not doing anything wrong. Are you sleeping? Are you asleep? Excuse me. I was too harsh this morning. I don't know what got into me. You were completely innocent. Forgive me. - It doesn't matter. - Are you sure? There's nothing worse than being falsely accused of something. - Are you sure..? - I'm sure. My beloved. Because I knew it would be you! If only you knew how much I've missed you. I had an awful dream about you. You're so silly. No one that I know would even consider to call at this hour. No one but you. Nobody else is allowed to either. When will I see you again? Not sooner? The wait will be terribly tedious. No, I understand. I know about your situation. What's wrong? Nothing you can tell me about? What will your wife say? Won't this wake her up? No, please. Don't go. Talk to me some more. It's so comforting to hear you voice. I wish you weren't so far away. I can never reach you when I need you. No, I don't think so. No. I'll tell you a secret. Something you never could have imagined. Hello? Hello? Nothing for me? Hello? Hello? Oh, I'm glad it's you again. Last night was terrible. I was cut off. It's because I ran up the stairs. It can't be true. Really? Oh, goodness, it's not possible. A whole day together. I'll make up a lie. Sure, I'm getting pretty good at lying. Though, Lisbeth is alone at work today... I don't know. Do you have any suggestions? Can you call me in ten minutes? I'll know by then. Can you? What now? Can she hear you? Kisses, bye. Hi, Lisbeth! I'm not feeling very well. I've been up all morning prepared to go, but I'm actually feeling a little seedy. I'm sure I'll be fine tomorrow. By the way, I have three letters that must be printed before eleven o'clock... Thank you so much. Thank you. Hello! No, that's fine. We have the whole day to our disposal. Oh my! Poor baby. Does it hurt a lot? It's probably just a deciduous tooth. Is he afraid of the dentist? No problem! I can wait. I'll eat a cracker if I get hungry. Call me from the dentist when you are done. Eleven o'clock... Half past twelve. Goodbye. ...you're entitled to a welfare officer, good luck. The signature "fifteen-years -and-constantly-crying", has a wise and proper view of things. You're writing that you can no longer communicate with you mother, "She's looking so imploringly at me, and it feels like I'm betraying her". That's not a deceit... Hello? Oh, it's you. How did you know I was at home today? No, it's nothing dangerous. I only have a cold. Yes, yes, next week maybe, if I have the time. I'm terrible busy right now. I should probably crawl back to bed again. It was awfully kind of you to call. I love the nightstand you gave me. I don't know how I've managed without. No. Goodbye! Bye! Well, was the dentist nice? How long will it take then? I see. I must have misunderstood. I thought your wife was out of town today. It can't be helped. It doesn't matter if it gets late. The main thing is that you come. I understand. Yes, I understand. No, there's no need to worry. I'll be fine while waiting. But, please don't call again. Don't call no more; just make sure you'll be here. Are you up? I was on my way to the pharmacy. - Where did you come from? - From work of course. I thought you could use some milk and bread. You're so kind. I suddenly felt better. Thank you. Shall I help you with dinner? But I can at least go to the pharmacy for you. I'll go myself. It's kind of you to offer. But I'm feeling a lot better. Tomorrow I'll be back to work again. You shouldn't be so obliging. I can't accept it. Where are you going? I'm going home to study. Well, I'll see you soon. You don't have the time, remember? Not until next week. Maybe... Karl-Erik! Karl-Erik, the dinner is ready! Hello? Who has the car now? Is it you? But I can take a taxi into town and meet you there instead. It doesn't matter if it'll be short. Only I get to see you. I'm going mad like this, I've been waiting for you all day. No, it doesn't matter. Of course we should! Don't call me before you come, just come, but it has to be before nine o'clock. The doorway closes at nine. How long do we have? Don't ask me that. - I want to know. - Half an hour. Not more? Twenty minutes really. Twenty minutes; my marriage with you. I'm only causing you harm. You do me some good too. It doesn't matter what you do to me. Your shirt got wrinkled. What will your wife say when you show up with your shirt like this? She'll probably iron it. I'll iron it for you. Take off your shirt. You have enough time for that, right? Please let me. We can't continue like this. No more days like this. You don't have the strength. Yes, I do. You know so little Emma, about yourself. Am I a bad mistress? You're a little fool. Did he behave well at the dentist, your boy? He did. Will you let me see him sometime? I'd like a photo of you two together. My earring! Where's the other? God what a mess. Shoes and hairpins everywhere. You must leave now if you're going to get home in time. We didn't even have the time to caress each other. We'll do it the next time. Hey... - Yes, what is it? - Nothing. I just wanted to say goodnight. Thanks for the loan. Don't you need it anymore? - You look tired. - I had an exam last Wednesday. No wonder you look tired. Glad it's over, right? Over? I didn't make it. - I'm sorry. - Sorry for what? Do you think it's your fault that I'm failing? I work all day and study all night, always, always. I'm sick to death of it. I've been so impossible this autumn, towards everybody. I've only thought about myself. I don't understand why you want to meet me again. Were you ever serious about me? Did you ever intend to marry me? Is that so hard to answer? There's so much I'd like to explain to you. - Last summer I met a man... - I don't want to hear it. I already know all about it. The guy with the roses, right? Are you getting married then? - He's already married. - He can get a divorce. It's over between us now. You too. You are just like everyone else. - Married men are on fashion this year. - It's over, I told you we broke up. When? - Yesterday. - Long time ago... So you're really not going to see him anymore? - No. Don't be mad at me. Please. I can't stand it. I know what you're thinking about me. Nothing is worthwhile anymore. My work schedule has gone to hell. - It can't continue like this. It can't. - No. I don't want this either. I need to get away from everything. I saw an ad yesterday. It was an accommodation in Rome. A Swedish family who needed help with their children. Go there. It might do you good. But, you... - Leave me alone! - I'll write you. I'll write often. I don't give a damn about what you do. Go there and see other people and mess it up with them, as you did with me. I know your type by now. You must wear something on your head; otherwise you'll catch a cold. - No! - Yes! How awful! This is the kind of cellar where The Count of Monte Cristo was imprisoned. - No! - Yes. He ate rats. - That's scary. - He didn't get food. Be careful so you'll not stumble. - Just a little bit over there. - Wait, wait. There you go. The laundry too? It's hot. What are you going to wear on Saturday? I'll wear a skirt. In that case I can't wear my new one. - Why not? - It's low cut. Borrow my striped skirt! - It's not a good fit. - It doesn't matter. But think about my hips. There's nothing wrong with your hips. I won't go! - Oh, God, it's heavy - And it's dirty too. - I can wash it for you. - Can you? Sure, I'll put some newspapers below. Can I put the clothes here? Of course. I mustn't forget the tapestry. I want to bring it... Oh, it's stuck. God, I'm so tired. You're throwing it on me? I'll miss them. I like it with you. Imagine that one can be so lucky. It's so calm around you, did you know that? Maybe I don't need to go. But you've already decided to go. You can't change your mind now. Can't I? Fine, I'd be happy if we didn't have to be apart for six months. Send them a telegram and tell them you've changed you mind. They would be baffled. - You're a little silly, aren't you? - Am I? Hello? No, I've been at home the whole time. It must have been when I was in the basement. No, I can't. No I can't, I have a guest. No, it's not a good time. Don't dwell on this too. Am I not allowed to have a girlfriend over? Please, dear... Leave me alone. I can't take it. Yes, I know. It's difficult for both of us. For me too. I've told you I don't want to! Forgive me. It wasn't fair to you. I had to say it was a friend. He gets so worried otherwise. He's so hopelessly jealous. I'm not much more... than a friend to you anyway. Don't say that. You mean a lot to me, you know that. Do I? What do I mean to you? You're the only safety I know. The only one I can rely on. Hello? You can't keep calling like this. I have packing to do. No, but, you can't. Please, my dear. Love... He's on his way. Hey! Hey! I'll call you. Forgive me. UNFAITHFUL WIFE. Don't hit me. Or, hit me. You of all people have the right to. - No, don't touch me. - Yes, I want to. I want to, I want to, I want to... I admire them, the married men; wife, children and mistress. And yet they manage their work. How do they find the time? What are you doing? I'm helping you to pack. Not now, you should go home. Then who'll do the packing? He obviously couldn't help you. But I have the time. More than him. When will the movers be here? Half past seven. We have the whole night to finish. Well... Where were we? Good evening. I can't keep anything together. Do you think I'll ever feel like a person again? You have to be patient with yourself. A man like you deserves a different girl. A warning to travelers on platform six: Don't stand too close to the platform edge. Incoming trains. You have to go now. You can't follow me all the way. Hey, I'll se you in six months. It will feel like no time. Don't you think? Now you'll get peace and quiet to study. Can you call me when you get to Trelleborg? Yes, if I have the time. Call from the ferry. - Can one do that? - Sure. It's not expensive. - Promise? - I promise. Promise? What do you want? What are you doing here? We've said goodbye. No, we haven't said goodbye. - Not in a proper manner. - Oh, God. Will it start all over again? Not start over. Start again, you and me. - You and I together. - I don't believe you. You have to. - Have you spoken to your wife? - No, but I've finally decided. - You'll divorce her? - Yes. I don't want you to. What do you mean? You've wanted me to get a divorce earlier? - Not anymore. Don't you love me anymore? - No answer? - I don't want to talk about this anymore. - But what have you decided? - To never see you again. - You're doing well, I see. - Well, thank you. Excellent. What about me? You've got your wife. Your son. Your dog. Do you have others waiting for you when you get back home? Safer bets? Younger? Juveniles? Is that what you're after? No. I want you, but I'll never have you. Come on, where is your compartment? Get your things. Do you hear me? Fetch your things. - Why? Don't ask. I'll sleep here tonight and you'll get off. Now... - ...soon, next time we stop. - How many bags do you have? Two. What number? I said, what number? 28. I'll follow you to Trelleborg. This compartment is for us. I have bought tickets. No! You'll get off! I don't want to see you anymore. It's sickening. I don't want to live like this. It disgusts me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sorry, sorry... I forgive you. Here and now and forever. Whatever you do, I'll forgive you. Don't you see? I'm all alone... Even if you divorced you wife and married me, I'd still be alone. When you're with me too? I love you. I'm never alone when I'm with you. - Leave for a while, so I can get ready. - No, I'm staying here. I haven't been to bed with you for real one single night. This is the first time we get to spend the whole night together. I won't leave you even for a minute. Unbutton my dress. Move over. Your tickets. Thank you. - Mr. and Mrs. Flor... - That's correct. - Here you go. - Thank you. I borrow everything. Even your wife's name. Why should these things take so long to comprehend? What are you talking about? My new discovery. Shall I tell you about it? No, should I? I don't really exist. Feel! Pinch! Pinch hard! Can you feel that this is I? You see for yourself. I just remind you of something. A dream that you're afraid to lose. That's not so strange, since it's not me whom you love. Can't you see that? You don't care about my everyday life. You wouldn't want to share it with me. But he wants to. - The juvenile? - Yes, the juvenile. Don't touch my sunburn. It's tender. My skin is peeling. What animals shed their skin? Snakes, isn't it? I'm a snake. My old skin is peeling off. You can have it. With best regards. If only it didn't make one bitter. Leave for a while. We should at least make sure that we don't get pregnant. Do you bring stuff like that when you travel abroad? - Yes... Does it hurt you? You'll continue to live with your wife. I don't want to live alone either. I've got used to having a man. It's because of you. When I met you, you couldn't even look after yourself. You've taught me. My love, you can't forget me. You can't. Take it away, take it away. I had a dream about something. What did you dream? I don't know. You can't leave me. Not for real. I wouldn't bear it. I woke up and became a little worried for you. There's no need for that. I'm not going to jump off the train. Not in my nightgown at least. Wasn't it good? What? Last night. Yes, it was good. Do you regret that I came with you tonight? No. Hey... Hey... Yes? Don't do harm to yourself. What do you mean by harm? Well... Now when you get out. If it becomes difficult, for you, all alone. Don't do anything rash. It is equally difficult for both of us. Is it? That's nice to know. Are you mocking me? No, I'm not mocking you. Later... When you get back again... You haven't understood, have you? You'll never reach me again. It's all over. You... Yes? What did you want to say? I CAN'T CALL YOU FROM THE FERRY AS I PROMISED I WON'T BE BACK. 12 crowns, please. English subs by peyotequeen
