Have been sent to the department directly Any demands? Truce talks? So far, nothing 2 Govt officials in the list of casualties, that's all 'Sir, with all due respect' Not sharing this video online with media and public Any specific reasons? If all the high ranked officials in our department ...are being killed by some random serial killer Public will lose faith in us There will be chaos So Before the next life is lost we should nab that gang 'They are a group of 5' We found all their voices are digital tweaked in a software 'No fingerprints No hair follicles' 'No sweat drops' Zero leads Now we need your help, Amar What about the 2 containers that went missing from the harbor?

Why have you assigned him to nab the serial killer? Isn't there anyone else in our department? Wait - Check if his vehicle has left - Okay, sir Yes, sir They have left, sir It's clear, sir Sir, you brought him in for this mission Why will he eavesdrop? He will fix a bug He will suspect everyone 'Have you heard of Black Squad?' Operation Unknown? 'He heads the team' 'In our system his name is Amar' 'But his real name' 'Only he knows!' 'They don't possess any Govt ID card' 'No ID proof No bank account' 'They are just nobody' 'Trained to be reckless' 'They act like a spy or under cover agent' To tell you in simple terms Govt's sleeper cell 'They have an agency' 'That agency sends them cases and operations' 'Whichever city they operate in they merge with the residents of that area' 'Exit easily whenever their mission is accomplished' 'First and foremost rule is not to reveal any details of their mission' 'Not talk about the agency' 'So friends, family, girlfriends' 'No chance even in a million!'

Baby Do you know why I agreed to get married to you? Till date You have never asked me anything about where or what I work as From the orphanage till now You trust me implicitly Let that faith continue Just because we get married if you plague me with questions I'll feel you are losing your trust in me Hereafter I won't ask you again Beyond this decision if I ever ask you That's the last day I will be in your life Wow!! Don't you dare laugh at me In all the States of India He can be the topmost bigwig If he needs to be killed unaccounted Unethically This is the team for you Nagaraj sir Like the old proverb, only a snake knows the track left by its kin Likewise, only a masked man can reveal the face of another masked mystery man Amar is the right person for that 'These are the weapons given to us by Case Of Custody, sir' This is Arun, techie We have handpicked him Sir, victim # 01 'Inspector of police Prabanjan' 'Assistant Narcotic Commissioner' Victim #2, Karnan, age 60 Prabanjan is Karnan's son - But adopted son - No! Adopted father It was the son who adopted the father 'Prabanjan' 'Stephen Raj' They are within the department Follow their case history But this victim Not connected at all with the department 'Why should the mask man kill this commoner?' I have checked his account completely Contrary to what you're saying he didn't make any such cash transaction I am not so moneyed to give cash casually, madam After lending it, neither did Karnan sir ask me I wasn't in town for a few weeks I come back to hear this news Sorry Anyways thanks a lot for returning a loan even after his demise Thank you I don't know what exactly happened If you don't mind can you tell me what happened? That too, at this age You tell me If a man at his age living in your house had died What would be the cause of death? Heart attack? Brain stroke? Or suffering from an ailment and bedridden for many weeks? Am I right? Will anyone die in a grenade explosion? If in his 60s, he was killed so ruthlessly What depths of cruelty he must have sunk to? Who do you think is the murderer? I don't know Prabanjan brought this man home one day claiming he was his father 'I believed it too' 'But after 'he' died he isn't the man I call 'appa' for sure' What happened? Mama Mama 'After Prabanjan died' 'Not one night has he come home without being sloshed' 'Even though he knew about my son's heart condition' '...that man is not bothered about anything' The very thought of that man makes me boil with rage 'But I was told' - You call him 'dad' - True that I was calling him 'appa' Appa became uncle Uncle became 'mama' in a generic way 'Mama' is now 'that man' But I am not responsible for my changed mind-set When did he- The baby has a heart problem 'Rare epilepsy disorder' 'He can't tolerate too loud a sound' [mobile ringing] Sorry, I'm getting many calls from the Embassy, I got to go - 1 minute - No, sorry Akka, I'll wait out Bring the boy and come 'Okay, dear' Actually Prabanjan is a 'medal of honor' candidate, sir His death isn't an accident There are many rumors floating around Stephen was imprisoned due to countless allegations The entire department knows which case made him count bars 'It was only 3 days since he was released from jail' I went to visit my mother Before I could get back Wretched fellows! They killed him His behavior after his son's death wasn't right at all Places he visited, people he befriended All bad, that's why I resigned What was his daily routine? Shall I tell you something I haven't even told the police? He smokes a lot of weed We'll go to the golf club every morning' 'He will play for half an hour' Then he will sit under a tree and fiddle with his laptop He will bum 2 cigarettes from me He will unroll it, add 'something' and smoke Then I will drop him in the gym Even if his routine slightly varies He'll never miss going to the golf club, 7 to 8 a.m daily Does he smoke? That's all you get for your damn face, go - No, sir, that- - Spoke for so long and you ask me again? No His report said he was a teetotaller That means? He doesn't smoke or drink Then take that as gospel Why come and ask me? What are you doing? Tell me, man Tell me, what happened! My...my neck, sir You're hurting me Whatever I said is the truth If you like I'll take you Where? 'This is actually erythroxylum novogranatense' 'It's not exactly cocaine' It turns into cocaine only when processed Supposing we have 5 grams We can get 5 kg of cocaine from this But depends on its quality 'You're right, sir' The 2 containers missing from the harbor And the murder by the masked man were on the same day The raw cocaine substance you got from Karnan's house And Stephen Raj have an unusual connect The case that sent him to jail Cocaine bust in Trichy 3 and 1/2 months ago The same substance we got hold of Erythroxylum extract And guess the suppliers? Adaikalam and gang Sir, 'Adaikalam and gang' in Trichy is just a small dot The biggest network in that supply chain is operating in Chennai, sir 'Lungi gang' 'With the harbors in the coastal areas under their control' 'A huge network involved in cocaine trading' What, I say? Taking a dig at me, huh? You think a group-threat will make me pee in my pants? Goddamn incapable of finding the missing stash 'If such a gang is controlling the entire city' 'There must be a head' Yes, his name is Sandhanam Between the masked man And those 2 containers He is the main key So our first move Decode Sandhanam Forever under Saturn's malefic effect! No...no, sir Sir...sir 'They are his lackeys, chief' Peddlers in Sandhanam's link 'Don't...don't, sir Don't hurt me, sir 'I believe he comes here to work out' Do you know what his profession was? Did you see him before he died? Whatever you say will be useful for my article That's why Work out? My dear boy I know Karnan for 40 years I don't know where and what he works as He will come and go of his own accord Suddenly be missing for 6 months All these years he had no bad habits Only after his son passed away he has become- Listen, my boy This gym is like a temple to me This is my seat My room Only he is allowed inside He will sit here and happily get sloshed 'I have never questioned him' Drink here? Right here 'There...all over the place' "I'm drinkin up" "I'm so wasted" "I've had 3 shots of JD" O' God, bless us with clarity of thought "Some JÃ¤germeister in my belly and I'm about to win" Praise be to Lord Shiva "I'm freakin' drunk" 'I am totally against alcohol, bro' 6 pack when I was young- Forget all that Drink by all means But why disturb others? What is your age? 'An eve teasing incident happened here the other day' How dare you drink in the gym! He is the one! [loud belch] 'Not knowing who he his gym members called the cops' 'It blew out of proportion' It's okay if he stopped with drinking nonstop Yes, his son died Drink pegs of whiskey Guzzle bottles of brandy But womanizing? Don't you have a grandson? Prostitute, huh? Sure? Yes, I say He'll be there all the time Only because I questioned him we almost came to blows Our ties snapped totally He stopped talking to me But I didn't think he would die Even his body wasn't found I was told just one leg of his was found Sir, do you have the brothel house address? Sir, only for interrogation Even I interrogated, my boy! 'The child has some problem in his heart it seems' If he hears too loud a noise he can even die it seems So from the day this child was born There is pin drop silence in this house - Sir, is my 'dosa' crisp? - Super - Shall I make 1 more? - No, thank you This lady bad mouths him Has she ever put the baby to bed even one night? 'Not even once' The child will sleep only on that man's chest True, sir, he drinks all the time So what? 'What do you want him to do? His son was beaten to death' 'He was helpless That's why he drinks' When his son died, this whole city was boiling in rage and turmoil But he didn't show even an iota of anger Do you know why, sir? His grandson means the world to him [baby wailing] "In grief trembles my shattered soul" "To hold you in my arms; I lose control" "Now a broken warrior I weep Needles in my heart pierced deep" "My world froze to a standstill for me" "The minute hand refuses to do its duty" "Do I rest your head, my baby on my chest to sing a lullaby?" "Or light my loved one's pyre to bid him farewell forever?" "A lion in the arena as champion in anguish now standing all alone" "Though broken and grief-stricken I live for you, my only kith & kin" "Do not cry, my dear son My life is with you, little one" "I wilt and wane to protect you like eye lid to eyes, true blue" "In grief trembles my shattered soul to hold you in my arms; I lose control" "A brave warrior now battered teary-eyed I breakdown shattered" 'Sir, as far as I'm concerned he is a good man at heart' He may visit a prostitute or entertain a mistress I don't know about all that He is a good man By the way, what did you say you work as? Huh? I own a computer company 'Oho!' - How much should I inject? - 3 ml - Hah? - 3 ml 'Sir...why did you bring me here?' 'Let me go, sir' 'Sir...sir, what are you doing?' Tell me now 'All the heav...heavy loads' In a container In a ship Deals clinched on board a ship 'Only the smaller dealings' 'In a goods train' 'Transferred to a tanker' 'That's how I got to know Sandhanam's men' 'Some item of theirs' It is missing and they are searching now I think it is some huge container, sir That container 'As soon as it was missing everyone behaved like lunatics' Sir, he works as the writer in E3 police station Vanakkam, sir This is the only CCTV footage of Sandhanam seen in public Sir, this is a regular raid We got information the 'Lungi gang' had come with their haul on that day The others in the department were on their rounds Only the Police constable went to the spot Sir, can you send me a back-up jeep? I am all alone here You are such a pain, I swear Talk to the inspector, wait - Okay, sir - Sir Why are you dragging me into your problem? Let me go Look ahead and drive properly! Sub Inspector told you, right? Why are you hassling us? Not troubling you, sir When we nabbed him he had a lot of stash on him That's why I closed down his clinic 'He looks a bit weird, sir' His whole body is tattooed, sir - What do you mean? - 'Yes, sir' And even claims to be a doctor! 'Okay, where are you now?' I am near Aavin booth on Thirumangalam route Got handcuffs on you? - Yes, sir - 'Handcuff him' - 'I will send reinforcement' - Okay...okay, sir 'Show me your wrist' Showing off your power? Son of a gun! I will beat you to a pulp in the station 'Give me your damn wrist!' 'Show me your hand' "Where is the love?" "Help me my friend" "You know the reason for this agony" "Where is the love?" "Help me my friend" "You know the reason for this agony" "Tell the whole world" "Tell the whole world" "Take it down" "Take it down" "System Failure" "Take it down" "Take it down" "Tell the whole world" "Whole world...whole world" Yes, sir You can't see Sandhanam anywhere outside So I went in disguise to his place I've come from Pest Control My boys are already working inside, bro Come on 'Don't pull, it hurts, akka' - Do you spray in every corner? - Yes, bro Only then you won't have any problem for 2 years Sandhanam is one of 24 siblings He is right in the middle The rest are from maternal and paternal side, a big group of cousins 'Your gold tooth is seen, sir' 'Enough of admiring yourself in the mirror, come' 'Sister, move a bit inside' 'Bro, quiet please Look in front' 'Sir, you won't believe me' 'He has 3 wives' What is your problem, dear? How many times I've told you only I'll sit to your right? You always have her to your right First ask her to sit here Only I should sit there Which side is my heart? 'Left' "What's cookin', man?" He's a bit of a psycho, sir He is on drugs according to his mood swings "What's cookin', man?" 'Okay...okay' Don't keep lamenting All the guns have a license I'll send you one, hang up now 'They had an armory of licensed guns' 'As far as I know, more than 50 double barrel guns' 'And they say he is Sandhanam's uncle' 'He is the one who educated Sandhanam' Other than Sandhanam no one else is educated in the siblings group of 24 Even if it is 1 decimal higher the customer is dead Customer satisfaction is most important The earlier batch we mixed Is it the same or different? It's a neuro toxin Methamphetamine Repeat what I just said You won't believe me This society thinks he is a doctor I have this terrible pain in the area between my stomach and chest If you step out and turn right At the end of the road is Dr Dharmalingam Then what about you, doctor? I didn't attend college when this topic was taught! You are suffering from jaundice You shouldn't touch alcohol hereafter I'll give up drinking from tomorrow, doctor - Then today? - I'll enjoy just 180 ml Better you drink 375 ml tonight Sleep peacefully and you will rest in peace! Thank you, doctor He isn't a doctor, sir Just cover up, that's all His clinic is just a set-up, sir But he's up to something else inside And correct, sir After the containers went missing the killings sky rocketed 'One who kills blatantly without fear has no necessity to wear a mask, sir' Why are you glaring at me? We are doing our best and searching everywhere 'When the tracker is turned on we can trace the container' 'If you interrogate me like this?' Hey! Hold him Hey...anna...anna! - Stop it, anna - Take it from me Listen to me Control yourself Anna, are you mad or what? Hitting a police officer? Don't you have enough trouble on your hands?

'That too as if I have met him and befriended him' Sorry You won't understand all this You sleep, baby 'Like how you are familiar with that man's face' 'May be he knows very well too' 'When I die a man will come' Like in these old crime novels Leaving clues behind types 'Technical glitch in that area' This is called 'blind spot hub' So whatever whoever does in that area We cannot track or trace 'Can't be detected on radar either' - Thank you - Pleasure's mine Hey! You want to know what 'he' did physically to me? And he did this 'This is a video recorder' 'It's a RF transmitter bug' 'A rare model' Definitely not from India Probably from Israel Either from RAW agency 'Joining the dots with all this' Before Karnan died He may have been linked to a big drug mafia That may be the reason he would have been murdered Or on the other hand the dead man isn't even Karnan What if it is someone I think? He is on a mission Chief, 2 people who used this room frequently after it was bugged PWD officer Veerapandian And contractor Rudra Prathap And both of them went into hiding after Stephen Raj's death And all of a sudden They were to meet Sandhanam's gang and the city distribution gang But Rudra Prathap isn't meeting them because of his daughter's wedding tomorrow So only Veerapandian is attending the meeting Tilak is now on his tail This is the 7th day And he could be the next Let's give it a try, boys Yes, sir - 'When will he reach the spot?' - 5 minutes 'I am following him' - 'Should I go in?' - Wait till I tell you Sandhanam won't come nor any of the bloody bigwigs I have to clinch the deal with lackeys like you, eh? Okay, I'll tell you Let me see if you can understand This is the nearest starting point of the sewage channel from Chennai harbor This is the blue print of Chennai suburb's sewage channel Do you know what a blueprint is? Sketch Map It has 7 spots 'Only one spot has the substance' Only Rudra Prathap and I know these 7 locations It took us so long to unearth this information Here, transfer the amount to my account as discussed Then I will hand over this file fully to you 'Bro, Veerapandian sir is being a pai- Hi sweety pie Now Mr Veerapandian will face an honorable death here! If all of you maintain silence only he will die I am the only hero in this scene No one needs to show off being a hero There are 12 bullets in this rifle I have 60 bullets in hand I can finish off all of you So all of you sit tight with everything zipped 'If you sit, it will automatically close!' Sit down [Telugu & Hindi] Sit down! 'Sir...sir' 'Please, sir Please, sir' 'Please, sir Please, sir' Go but no more casualties Please, sir Please, sir 'Hey! Come here' Hey! Stop 'Sir, let me go Why are you nabbing me?' 'I came to deliver water can, sir' 'Sir, let me go' Go back and sit 'Bejoy' 'Special Task Force Officer' Many busts and rewards to his credit 'Drugs worth 900 kg seized' 'Officer behind the biggest bust in Trichy' Close to A tonne?! Impressive To add to your grief According to recent news Your wife and child were murdered Shall we inform Jose sir Rudra Prathap is the next target? 'I was thinking' Sitting on this side in an interrogation room I have a different point of view now - Comfortable? - It's okay Not bad - Can I have one? - Oh! Yes Repeating my question Be precise in your answer Sir, am I a common thief? Why have you tied me up? From the morning I've told you I'm hungry Get me something to eat Only then I'll see these photos You get food only after you point out the man - Don't leave me like this, sir - 'Did he identify?' - Claims he doesn't know - Untie me, sir If you are the head of your gang Instead of the remaining 4 ending up as headless corpses, you can call them 'You can call them' Because...instead of dying in the middle of the road like a street dog Within 4 walls, in a slightly decent way Let's discuss our plan of action in the police department A decent death within 4 walls! You know the biggest drug bust you mentioned just now Do you know the proper reward I got for all that trouble I went through? 'Within 4 walls' 'I was tied, helpless' And in front of my eyes My- They killed my wife and child For 2 days My child Lay dead staring at my face No one came to my aid Watching flies swarming over their lifeless bodies I sat there helpless for 2 days unable to even cremate them! I had no fear of death No idea what it is even But they have thrust the fear to even breathe now! So if you kill all rank officers hiding behind that mask Do you call that quits? What if other cops who lose their loved ones act just like you? What happens to this city? Or will it bring back to life your wife and child? My wife and child can't come back 'But the family of at least some honest cop will escape this injustice' Should innocent children who don't know about drugs ...die due to the dirt in our system? We are cleaning it And we will clean it Until it's clean This is the same in many countries Under different names Anti-national organizations flourish Yov!

Shouldn't they be safe?' No, I'll update you The 2nd man who died isn't Karnan Look at this photo Agency created to unethically uproot various anti-social elements within India Black squad I am their present batch This team Pilot batch 'Pilot Black Squad' This is the Karnan you claimed was dead Vikram He is Agent Vikram 'In the 1980s' 'Under the direct governance of the Prime Minister' 'A stealth team was formed' 'Initially it was called Prince Guardian' 'And later, the name was changed to Black Squad' 'There were 11 members in the pilot batch of Black Squad' 'Their head commander was Agent Vikram' 'More than 100 operations have been accomplished by this ruthless team' 'Unfortunately' 'Their operation in 1991 backfired' 'Agency disowned them' 'Branded the entire team as terrorists' 'Took action against them by wiping them out totally' 'Not just 11 of them' 'Killed their family, friends all their near & dear ones, most brutally' 'But there isn't a single trace of evidence regarding this' 'Till date' '4 bodies alone are missing in this team of 11' 'That includes Vikram as well' And their death Still remains a mystery 'So if we compare' 'The one who unmasked in front of me' The man presumed dead in our old records It's your man Vikram Then are the reports given by his witness and family members all fake? If my assumption is right all this is Vikram's plan 'The face he showed the others is different' 'His real face is something else' 'He made everyone believe he was a drug addict and alcoholic' 'Having found out his son was killed for that missing container' 'In order to nab the real killers' 'He worked from that blind spot' 'Working in the shadow like a ghost' 'From the conversations between Veerapandian and Rudra Prathap' 'He found out' 'All of them are working hand in glove for Sandhanam's containers' 'He needed the entire history of Sandhanam and gang from Nungambakkam police station' - All okay? - All okay, sir - 'Sudhakar's right shoulder is dislocated' - Thank you, boys 'And finally he found a match' - Why is it so crowded there? - Don't know 'Cocaine supplied by Sandhanam' 'And the missing containers with cocaine is one and the same' Confirmed 'Erythroxylum' 'Like the masked man who killed Prabanjan' 'He utilized his own team' 'And made everyone believe he was killed' 'He started wearing the same mask' 'All those who died so far are responsible for Vikram's son's death' 'Anyone else connected to that murder' 'If they are linked' 'The killings will continue' Is this man opposing the Govt for a son he adopted? What if he was his biological son? Other than the name 'Vikram' we got nothing on him in our records His work, his murders, his salary The weapons he used His achievements, et al Unaccounted Having lived under different names and disguises all these years Finally He is silent all along now under the name of Karnan He hid from the Govt the fact he has a son He wanted his son safe and alive Hence his apprehension Now someone has killed his son Very sad! They don't know Vikram's might Amar Then isn't Prabanjan's son his biological grandson? May be, sir Alright, forget...forget that 'Are there only 4 members in his team or more?' Perhaps one more, sir 'It could be his own grandson' 'More than the fury of his son being killed' 'He may be alive to protect his grandson with a frenzy' 'He was the most wild and expandable one' 'Referred to as ghost' So, Amar, you don't know where he is now? You asked me to trace the killer He's your man My mission is accomplished It isn't right to leave this job half done, right? Sir, when I took charge of this mission I thought it was a problem between the police department and serial killers But now This is war between an ex militant and his son's murderers I can't get involved in this, sir BOYS, ARE WE DONE? YES, SIR 'AMAR!' Hey! Answer and then walk out Check what happened over there Amar! Move aside You didn't help to nab him You and he are hand in glove That's why you allowed him to escape I can say this and turn the case against you I know who killed Prabanjan Your eyes gave you away If you can, try to save yourself You are asking me to be scared of a dead man Fine, if what you're saying is true This time, Karnan has to die once and for all You are talking about Karnan But I'm referring to Vikram! None of you can kill him Guess why? Because He is already a ghost! Pick up...pick up What happened? Have our men come inside? SAY SOMETHING! - Sir? - WHAT? Guns have been submitted, sir But evidence has been trashed, sir So what? Besides all this, Gelatin and 30 kg of RDX missing, sir Recently played Shouldn't we signal your boys?

Stop it 'Prabanjan, do you understand the gravity of this situation?' You should've told us about the container when we asked you Your fault you didn't tell 'You can't be killed that easily If I do, then what? I know the repercussions But...this pressure It's a bigger pain 'Okay' 'If you want, I'll arrange another medal of honor' I'll frame and give it to you at the right time All a matter of dealings I want to kill you now for your arrogance 'I don't have time for such games' Prabanjan What you have seized isn't 2 tonnes of cocaine 2 tonnes of raw substance Raw substance means, by using it you can make 2000 tonnes of cocaine!

He hasn't said anything but he will...I will make him talk - I'll talk to him - Be patient - Sandhanam, please - I just spoke to Stephen Raj 'He doesn't have a father' 'He's an orphan' 5 years ago, in an orphanage he adopted a 50 year old as his father! His name is Karnan 'That man doesn't have a profile the way he seems to brag' Sandhanam, don't be hasty We'll be buying trouble I'll try and talk to him Let me talk to him Don't you know who your father is? Or doesn't your mother know? If I call your father will he tell me? 'If you confess your crimes' 'Perhaps then I'll tell you' So you won't tell me where my substance is Even if your father asks me I won't blurt it out HEY! Nothing can be done He is gone, chapter closed Did you come here to do this? Don't I know to do this? If the department gets to know they will snoop right here Are you some top dog?

I care two hoots if Rolex kills me He'll bury my entire family alive! I DON'T WANT TO BE KILLED BY ROLEX I WANT MY STASH! This is not murder Statement With this We declare war against this system Send this video to the department We can divert the case to some terrorist group When you send the video Scratch the footage and mix the audio video, then send 'I have been following his father from the day Prabanjan died' In front of my team they slit his chest ruthlessly I was the one who analyzed his post-mortem report and signed it [Malayalam] He conned us It isn't too late even now When we get the stuff in our hands We can retrieve what we lost No don't have to fear any scumbag!

That is with sir- 'Don't you know who your father is?' 'Or doesn't your mother know?' 'If I call your father will he tell me?' 'If you confess your crimes' 'Perhaps then I'll tell you' Yes, sir - 'Sir? - Hmm' 'Sir, are you alright?' Yeah Yeah...what? Sir, by now they must be knowing our plan As soon as possible Our best bet is to kill Sandhanam Why should we change our plan? Sandhanam was the one who killed your son, sir He is the first accused You have to take revenge Aah! So you think this is a revenge story for my son's death? Who is that Sandhanam, sir? He's just a tool, sir Whoever has power in his hands on date is a Sandhanam! If I had wanted to kill him I would have, sooner than you think, sir My son has given his life For what? For a drug free society Don't we need to respect his sacrifice, sir? Do you know the drug's effect? Yesterday's betel leaves and tobacco You think this is its modern version No If this continues, we will go back to the monkey stage, sir It took us 80 million years To evolve from monkeys into human beings What does a monkey know? Multiply Proliferate They can't recognize their sister, their mother or their own daughter Nor any sibling Are we like that? Hey! Whom have you lost? Friend, sir They killed my sister, sir Colleague They killed your wife and son So you could take revenge and live happily after that Why did you come to me? Because of the ideology Whomever we killed is not a murder, sir It's a statement We cleaned the crap out of our society A masked face is necessary nowadays to carry out a good deed, sir! I'm an agent I can't divulge what I have done, sir I'm sworn to secrecy And known by my failures I have my success track record I can't announce it to the outside world I won't tell either I'm an honest militant I'm living underground for 30 years for a crime I never committed, sir For what joy? For my son's sake They killed him too Sir, I didn't mean that My grandson is alive Tomorrow when he is an adult he should know our legacy without fail He should know our share He should live in a drug-free society For him to do so Sandhanam has to be killed How do we kill him? How should his empire be destroyed? It should be National news, sir Only then tomorrow 'The thug who is even considering starting a drug business should tremble in fear' You know, man One man's terrorism is another man's revolution Yesterday's freedom fighter's secret song is our national anthem today Tomorrow we will be sung for what we did I am the rebel here What kind of radical rebel?
