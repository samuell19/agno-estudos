"Life Is My Movie Entertainment" "Big Kid Films" - Let's go... - Slow up! - Hey, it's not my fault you're too little for your own bike... - Whatever! - What's going on? - You better watch your little buddy Ryan, here. He's got a real problem. - I'm not gonna listen to your crap... - Yeah, he started it... - Whatever! - You pushed him. - This loser here needs to stop talking about my friends... - You better shut your mouth. - What's going on? - This clubhouse ain't for girl... - What? - You're not the boss Darren. - I don't want to be in your dumb clubhouse anyway. I'm gonna build my own... - You do that... - Yeah, you do that. - Yeah, and take your stupid girls with you. - Yeah, we don't want any stupid girls in our clubhouse. Why don't you all grow up and stop acting like a bunch of kids? - Guys what's wrong? - I told you guys. You can both play with my rope swing. - Darren think he can take control of the clubhouse and not let girls in anymore. - Why? What'd we do? - It's not like we have cooties. - Yeah, grow up. How do we know you don't have cooties? Guys! - Why did you hit him? - He was... - Shut up and let Darren talk. - Yeah, shut up! - What? - Barbra can't even hammer a naiI right. She left one sticking out of the wall and I cut myself. That's why I say she shouldn't be in the club, if she can't even hammer a nail. Well I guess Mr. Perfect over here has never, ever made a mistake. - Is that why you pushed him? - He pushed me first. - Yeah... well... you shouldn't have said that. Why? You like Barbra or something? This is stupid. Why don't we go work on the fort? Is anybody gonna play with my rope swing or not?

You just don't like to clean. - So... - You never do any of the dirty work around here. - Yeah huh. Well, looks like we got enough to finish the bottom floor. Man, how could they leave that much wood lying around? - Well, it is Friday. - Yeah. - Did you just fart? - Who? Me? - I know he wasn't talking to me. - What's a fart? - You know. Like when you cut the cheese. - No. What's that smell? Hey, ladies. Hey, Manuel. Hey, Holden... Man, Darren wanted to kick them out. This place would never be clean with out the girls. Dude, my Mom cleans more than any one I know. If my Dad didn't have my Mom, our place would always be a mess. Why are you always so quiet? I feel like I'm talking to myself sometimes. Yeah. Tell me something I don't know. You be the talker now. They got the wood. Go help them. Gosh, you guys hit the mother-lode. - I know. Good thing they don't work late on Fridays. - I know. - We got buckets too. - Yeah, I see. What if they couldn't finish building the house cause of all the wood we took? Hey, any of you guys want to help gather moss? You can count me in. You know what... you can count me in too. - Don't even ask. - Okay. - Do you wanna have a tea party? - Yeah, we can try inviting Wes and Stephen again. - Okay... I think we got enough. - Ah! - What? I'm not picking that up if there's any more spiders. Don't be a baby. I'm younger than you, and I'm not afraid of spiders. - That's not a spider. - Uh huh... No, it's not. Look, it's just a little daddy long legs. It won't bite. That's only because they don't have teeth. Don't you guys know? They're the most poisonous spiders in the world. - Really? - Shut up, Darren. - There it is. - Ah! We need another swing that's faster than this one. This swing's fast. Unh uh. This swing is super slow. Still not fast. Ah! Slow down! Still not fast enough? We should probably get back. Darren's gonna be angry, if we don't help out. Darren ain't the boss of you. Yeah, but he's the boss of the club house. - I don't think that's fair. Why do we have to have a boss? - I don't know, we just do. Well, why does it have to be him? He's so bossy. But that's what bosses are for. Why did you have to come anyway? Well... we all know that you need someone to hold your hand when you cross the street. That's why Darren had to run the fort. Oh no, I just didn't want you to break a naiI. That's all. Well, if you're so concerned about breaking things, then maybe you should just be quiet. Look there's some nails. Kind a small, don't ya think? - Nah, they'll be fine. - Yeah, you're right. My Mom is gonna take me shopping for some new clothes. - I got a new dress last night. - Why don't you wear dresses? - I don't know. I just don't. - You sing? Yeah? So that means you should like to wear dresses. Yeah, singing is a girl thing. Not uh, I know guys that sing. Not this one. See, we take this board, put it right up there. We can build a who?e new section. I, I kind of agree. I get what you're saying. But like, I don't think it will go good there. Like, it'll probably go better, a bit higher up there. Okay, yeah. See, if we put it there we could build a whole other section. - Hey, guys, guys, are these okay? - No... I told you they were too small. Somebody's gotta go back and get more. - Do you want to go get some more? - Sure. Where are you gonna put those? We should make it higher. You know, like a real clubhouse. It's dangerous to build it up like that. - Man I'm thirteen years old. Don't you think I know how to build a clubhouse? - Well, yeah but... You worry too much. Yeah, you worry too much. We know what we're doing. - This isn't really dangerous, is it? - No. All this work make me hungry. I'll be back. Man, it must have been really late. My little sister woke me up and said there was a dog... running around in the playroom. Well, you didn't believe her, did you? Not at first, but she kept pulling on me and telling me I had to come see. What's her name? My dog or my sister? Your dog. Oh, well, it's a boy. Well, what's his name? We haven't really decided yet. - You know, it's bad luck to have a dog without a name. - Says who? I saw it on TV. So how do you know it's true? Well... it's not like they can lie on TV, right? Yeah, I guess that makes sense. Yeah, if it's on TV, it must be true. Maybe I'll name him Thomas. That way I can boss you around whenever I want. Watch your step. What, you don't think I can look after my self? No... I just don't want you to trip over the board. I'm just fooling with you. Yeah, I know. Good one. So, I mean, what's up with Darren? I mean, girls aren't allowed in the clubhouse anymore? I don't know. It's not like I have a problem with girls in the clubhouse. Well, I would hope not. Nails. They look the same though. Yeah. But they'll hold the boards. Yeah, they'll hold 'em. You need to put it a little higher. Mmm... No, a little lower. Even lower. Lower. Hey, Manuel, this is going over the window. You know what, you're right. Maybe it should be higher. - Yeah, yeah. Go higher. - You heard the man. It's not a picture. Just make sure it lines up, guys. - Oh, man. I gotta get home. - What time is it? - Late. You heardtheman. Yeah, we gotta get home too. Jake! Jake! Yeah? - We gotta go. Come on. - Hold up. Naw, we have to leave now. C'mon, squirt. - Don't call me that. - What? Squirt? Squirt, squirt, squirt. Squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt. - If you don't stop, I'll tell Gwen you like her. - I don't care. Hey, guys. Wait up. Well, look who it is. So, you won't mind if we talk about you then? You're just so dreamy. Leave me alone. - Waiting for your girl? - Shut up, squirt. Oooh, you know you wanna kiss her. You wanna kiss her so bad. And you guys are gonna get married and have millions of babies and... Okay, listen, listen. I'll stop calling you squirt if you just shut up. Okay? - Thanks. Forgot my backpack. - Oh, no problem at all. Thomas would wait for you all day. What time are you coming tomorrow? I don't know. My grandpa's coming in town. What a big bike for such a little squirt. Only if I can be princess. I want to be a princess. Every time we play capture the princess, you two are always the princesses. She's right. Why don't one of you just let Jennifer be a princess? I'm not giving it up. I thought about it and... no. Fine, we will play capture the king. I select Ryan and me to be the first kings. I don't want to play capture the kings. - Wanna play at my house? - Yeah. Mary had a littIe lamb, littIe lamb. Mary had a littIe lamb, whose fIeece was white as snow. - You sing beautiful. - Thanks. But you sing better than you push. Then I won't push you. No, come back. Yeah, I don't know what else we could do with them, huh. Hey, they make good fans. Maybe we couId get Stephen to create something, that will make them move for us. You know, like an air conditioning. If anyone could do it, it would be him. Yeah, huh. Then maybe he couId even help me with my homework. It's funny how he's younger than us, but he's smarter than us. How did you do on your last math test? Not bad. I don't mind the numbers. Oh, good for you. I feel like math is always trying to give me a bad grade. - Are you joining us for tea? - What kind of tea is it? - It's not really tea. - Why are you whispering? We can't let Wes and Stephen know. - Oh, okay ladies. Uh, hope you enjoy your tea. - Yeah, have fun with the tea. Hi. Hey, you know they're making you tea in there. Woohoo! Don't know what she puts in that tea that isn't really tea, ha. Yeah. Hey, don't worry about that math stuff. If you ever need help, just let me know. Cool. - Why didn't you guys play? - You guys gotta tell me when you guys are playing. I would have... How does this work? You need to just... yeah. Umm... put this up there, and hang that from the top. It will make it easy when we have a bigger second floor. How will we pull it up? You just pull the rope. It's not that hard. Okay, mister Know It All. - Do you want me to explain it, Nick? - Shut up! No, you shut up! Both of you shut up! You're acting like a bunch of littIe kids. I think he was just asking... if you understood it. Why do you guys fight so much? Sorry, Nick. Let's just do this. Hey, guys. What's the commotion about? Jake was opening his mouth again trying to start something. Why did you say that? He just said he was sorry. - Go home if you're just gonna make problems. - Screw you. Big words for a little man. You just don't know when to shut up. I am trying to drink tea in here! Time out! Time out! Get off of him. Get off. What's going on? Tell your little brother to keep his mouth shut. What? You're not the boss of him. Keep your own mouth shut, and mind your own business. All you ever do is come here and make problems. I think it's time you leave. - Excuse me? - You heard me. Yeah, listen up. Why don't you leave? You're just a big, stupid, wannabe bully. What are you doing? Do you feel like a big man now because you can push around my little brother? What's going on? Seems like Darren over here can never keep from getting physical. - Then why don't you just leave. - We wiII. - Hold up, guys. No. Any one who wants to come with me to build a new clubhouse, let's go. We're not putting up with any more of your games. This is... really... this is, really bad. - Hey, Thomas. Maybe we should go talk to them. - No. Why are we leaving them? - So you don't have to see us fight anymore. - Why can't we just make up? - It's not like that. - Why? - Do you really want to be in a clubhouse where everybody fights all the time? - No. - Holly, Darren thinks he's better than all of us. - Yeah. And Darren isn't better than anybody else just because he says so. But they're our friends. Friends don't fight all the time. This is different. Yeah, this does happen like all the time. Which is why we're gonna build our own fort. Why can't they come to our fort? - They don't want to hang out with us. - They don't like girls. But... - Don't you understand? Now drop it. - Hey, guys. Um, does anyone know what a lemming is? - No. Well, a lemming is something that follows the other lemmings, no matter what. So if, one lemming runs across a field, they all run across the field. And if one lemming jumps off a cliff, they all jump off the cliff. That's why there are none left... Splat. - So, Nick is a lemming. - And Darren is his leader. What do lemmings look like? No, you're not understanding me. It doesn't matter what lemmings look like. They're just used to show you how stupid Darren is. - I don't get it. - Yeah, I don't get it either. I'm confused. So, are the lemmings real or make believe? Well, they're real. But, that doesn't matter either. All I'm trying to say is that lemmings are like people who follow. Like everyone in Darren's fort. - And we don't want to be lemmings to Darren, do we? - Why not? Because, then Darren will boss us around all the time, and we won't be free anymore. I get it. So, we're free, but we're not free to be lemmings. - Well... - I don't think they can make a good fort without us. - They're going to regret this. - I can't wait to see Darren beg us to come back. Nah, Darren isn't going to apologize. And we're not going back. Why does Darren get to keep our fort? - I'm done talking. I want to get to work. - Work on what? - Work on finding a new spot for our clubhouse. Okay, your the bossman. - Thanks for standing up for me. - No prob. I know you needed my help. - Yeah. - It's like we're all a big famiIy, and we gotta look out for each other. - Yeah. I guess we are. Besides, you stick up for me, too. - But that's different. - Different how? - Well, you're older than me. - That doesn't matter. Why did they have to leave? They were my friends. Would real friends have packed up and left you like that? Look who's still here with you. Who do you think your real friends really are? But I liked playing with them. Well, if they liked playing with you, as much as you liked playing with them, they wouldn't have left, would they? - Grow up, Wes. - But why can't girls be in the club? You have to have rules, otherwise you just do whatever you want whenever you want. Just hurt each other if you want. - But we didn't have rules before. -Things are different. - Who makes these rules? Well... I guess I do. I mean, I'm the oldest, and I know what's best for the group. - Why you? - Why not? - This is exactly what I'm talking about. - What? You can't do whatever you want whenever you want. If we all thought we should make the rules, then we'd have eighteen different clubs and eighteen different clubhouses. All in the same park. This park's not big enough. Besides, who wants to be in a club all by themselves? - Maybe you're right. -Yeah, I'm right. That's why I'm making the rules. But why do they have to leave? If you like the girls so much, why don't you just go with them? I can't believe this. This is so messed up, man. - It wasn't my choice. - Why do we always have to fight? - That's just how it is. Thomas obviously wanted to leave so he can go kiss his girlfriend all day. He forgot what's really important. They wanted this. - What's really important? - What's really important?! Look around you. This is important. The roof over your head. Your brothers. - Do you understand? - Yeah. They made the choice. - We don't need them. - They'll regret it. You'll see. These four wild robbers went to go rob the bank. So, one went to the back to look for cops. One went in the middle, so nobody would get them. One went to the phone, to call his helpers. And one went to steal the jewels. Now knock four times on this deck. The cops caught them all and put them into jail. I found it. We should build it right... Here! Uh, I don't know if this is the best spot, guys. It's awful close to the path. - I like the path. - Yeah, so do I. - We got some scrap wood but still not enough to build a fort. - It's enough for now. Well, where are we gonna get the rest of our wood from? - Same place we always did. - That house was almost finished. I know a new house they're putting upon my street. I rode my bike down there a couple weeks ago. - They already laid down the cement stuff. We could get wood from there. - I think I know the one you're talking about. - No, you don't. - Uh, huh. You couldn't. Alright, fine. Whatever you say. Tomorrow we're gonna go down there, and you're gonna lead the way. Since you know where it is. Okay, fine. I'll do that, Thomas. - You know, we don't have a hammer anymore. - What do you mean? - We left it there. Then we should just go take it back. I was the one who found it when we went to the construction site. - Nuh uh... - It was the twins that found it. No, I stole it from the construction site all by myself. Fair and square. Then we should go get it back. Hold on, guys. You know he isn't just gonna give it to us. Yeah, so we'll take it back. Cause it's ours. No. There is another way to do this. We can just use screws! - Gwen's Dad has a few hammers in their garage. - I have one at home, too. I thought you wanted to use screws! Well, it's not like we can do any thing with it right now anyway. Why don't we just plan on Gwen bringing one on sunday. - Okay, I'll ask her. - Is she home? - She said she would be over as soon as she got back. - We gotta get that back. - They can't just have it like that. - Yeah, besides we found it, too. so,weshouId beabIeto use it. I say we plan on coming out here to get it. - Thinking up the plan. I like it. - So, uh, when should we come out here? Tonight. - Jake, can you sleep over? - I'm sure I can. Just gotta ask my mom. - Alright. - You two can meet me outside of my house. - Alright. - Man, be quiet... - Sorry. I don't see why we can't just use the front door. TheaIarmwouId gooffifwedidthat. Oh,yeah. Wouldn,t the window make the alarm go off, too? Oh, yeah. I guess you're right. Maybe it's not on. - Here, let me try. - No, I got it. - Sometime this year. - Fine, you show me how it's done. Oh. So that's how you do it. Here, hold that side. - Why don't we just use the front door? - Yeah, ha-ha. - Man. Where is she? - Maybe she feel asleep. - Naw. Just give her a sec. - Hey! - Ah! - What are you doing? - Shhh! Shut up, guys. - Why did you scare us like that? - You're a wuss. I wasn't scared. - Whatever. - Man, this is almost too easy. - What are we gonna leave them? - Nothing. - What do you mean, nothing? - There is nothing here. The hammer is not there. - The hammer is not there. - Here, give me that. - Where is it? - Maybe they took it with them. - Why would they do that? - I don't know. Maybe they knew we would come here tonight to get it. - I don't think so. - I left it in that tool box, right before we split up, guys. - Well, it's not there now. - Maybe Thomas came back to steal it today. - Uh. No. - What do we need markers for? - To leave them something. - I like it. Uh. I don't know about this guys. We'd better get home. We came here to get a hammer, not do anything like this. - We're not going home without leaving them something. - Don't be stupid, Jake. You know they deserve this. - Darren's been asking for it. - Look at all the things he did to us. Now let's give him a taste of his own medicine. - What are you, a lemming?! - No! - Then prove it! I'll even give you a head start. Look, I don't see what your problem is. It was your idea, too. - Listen, I'm not going to the construction site with you tomorrow if you don't cheer up. - Whatever. - See, I told you I knew where it was. - Alright. Let's just get what we came for. No. First I want you to say, "My brother was right." And second, I want you to say, "What in the world was I thinking?" - Okay. Thes quirt was right, and why is he so short? - Ha-ha. Yeah, well, you know I'm just kidding. You were right, and I was wrong. You knew where it was. - Thank you, sir. - Yeah, just get to work, squirt. - So,where were you last night? - Oh. I, uh, stayed at Ryan's. - Cool, what did you guys do? - Oh, nothing. - Nothing? Well, then where's Ryan? - He's sleeping. - Oh. But tell me, how does it feel to be wrong? Boy, you are pushing it. Let's go. - Hey, guys. - Come on, jump down. - Where's Darren? - Darren's not here yet, that's who we're waiting for. - Okay. - Guys! - What's up? - What happened to our fort?! What are you talking about? - What is this? - They didn't color very nicely. - Darren's gonna be mad. We shouldn't have been mean to them. My Dad said we can use the hammer, if we pull weeds in the yard. Your Dad always tries to make us work for him. Huh, well, Gwen's coming here soon, and she should bring a hammer, too. - Do we still have to pull weeds even if we don't use your Dad's hammer? - I don't know. - I guess we'll have two hammers then. - What about the buckets? - What about them? - We should at least get those back. We just got them. - Yeah. - No. Anything we need from now on we're gonna have to get on our own. - I don't like starting over. - Well, no one does. But sometimes you have to do it. - We spent a lot of time on that fort. - Sorry. - Whose hammer is that? - That's not our hammer, is it? - Naw it's my dad's. - Okay, what's he making us do for him? - Very funny. - Holly, don't touch that. - You could, um...um... - Catch malaria. - Yeah. - What's malaria? - I don't know, but it sounded pretty good. - Oh. Well, let's get to work. What are you gonna do? Sit there and cry about it? Whine about "What did we ever do to deserve this?" I'll tell you what we did to deserve this. Nothing! Wonderful, ha. Does anybody here remember when this club was started? I'll tell you when it was started. Does anybody here remember Nick's brother, Billy? Well, Billy started this club four years ago. Instead of sitting there and crying, how about you ask yourself, "Who built the first fort here?" That's right. It was us! Who left who? If anyone can leave whenever they want and go build a new fort, what kind of club will we have then? If someone doesn't agree with our rules can they just go off and build a new fort in the middle of our park? No! What's mine is mine! Do you think a single tear is going to erase what they did to our fort? Do you think a whole flood of tears is going to stop them from doing this again? They're not a real club. They don't even have a fort! What they have is a junk pile in the middle of our park. Are we gonna sit here and let these losers keep tearing at us until there's nothing left, or are we gonna do something about it? We won't forget who started this. Every time we see this junk on the wall, we're gonna remember they've given us one more reason not to give up. If they want a war, then we'll give them a war. Thomas'll never build a fort in this park! This is our park! Yeah! - I think we're off to a good beginning. - You know, I kind of like this tree more. - Me too. - We should have a rope swing, too. - You know what, we should have two rope swings. What do you guys say about that? - We can even put one there. - We can put a swing there, too. - We rock! - Yeah. - Why should we wait? - I think we should just wait until tomorrow, man. It's a little too soon, that's all. - No. I think we don't attack now. Well... um... well, we need to do it now. - Didn't you hear Darren? We need to get them back! - I just think maybe we should wait until tonight. - Good idea. - But I'm scared of the dark. Just bring a flashlight. - We're gonna do it before it gets dark. You two go get the bats. - Yes. We do it today. We're doing it now. - You two are team one. And you two are team two. You guys remember the codes I told you earlier, right? - I wasn't listening to you. If they see you, go with a code 14. That way we can prepare. And if they're still there, go with a code 78. Oh, and if you... - Stop! - This doesn't have to be so complicated. - What's up with you and Gwen? - I don't know. - No, really. - You like her, right? - Oh, yeah. She's nice. - It's very obvious. - Oh, you mean like her like that? - You don't need to pretend with me. I'm a girl and we know these things. You turn red whenever she comes around. - This is where we can put the houses. - Where can we put the cars? - We can put the cars right, here. Oh, yeah. If you need anymore help just come and find me. - I think the idea of two rope swings is really good. - Thanks, buddy. You know, I really like this fort. - More than you like Gwen? - Ha. That's enough. - When you going to make the move? - What? How do you know about moves? You're only seven years old. - I saw it on TV. - Hey, how do you know about that? - Oh, hey. - Hey. - Why didn't you say anything? - I said "Hey". See, I told you. You don't always have to do something bad to get your way. I mean, we got what we wanted, and we didn't have to do anything bad to them. I just want you to see why we should do things sometimes, you know. Like yesterday. I thought it all through, and it all worked out. - Yeah I see what you mean. - Good. - Boo-Who? - Ah. Don't cry. - Ha-ha-ha-ha. - Team one, come in. - Team one here. - Do you have the 6-0-5 on the location? - Ummm... I forgot what that means. - He's asking if you see them. - We got a 2-1-2 on our end of the 6-0-5. - What's a 2-1-2? - Forget the numbers. Do you see them still there? - Yes. - Yes. - Let us know when the coast is clear. - No funny numbers! - But it was... - None! Alright. - Oh, oh, oh! What do you get when you cross a caterpillar and a parrot? - I don't know. What? - A Walkie-Talkie. Get it? - Hold on. I got the best one. - Knock! Knock! - Who's there? - Banana. - Banana who? - Knock, knock. - Who's there? - Banana. - Banana who? - Knock, knock. - Who's there?! - Banana orange-ya glad... oh, I messed up. - Aww. - Hold on. I got another one. Save it for another time. We have more important things to talk about. You know what we did today was great. We have a really nice looking fort. - I think it's much cooler than theirs. - Yeah! And it is. But, it still needs a lot of work. So, what do you all say we meet here early tomorrow? See you guys. Bye. Are you? I'll see you at home. - So, how's the puppy doing? - Thomas is doing good. - Really? You named him that? - Yeah, yeah. Did you tell Jake to ask me if I liked you? - No. Why? - Well, he did. - Oh, yeah, well, you know, he's just a little kid. You know how little kids do stuff like that. - Yeah. - So what did you say? - About what? - About what Jake said. - Oh, I can't remember. - Oh. - You wanna go to the movies this weekend? - I'd love to. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - That's cool. So, what movie do you wanna see? - I don't care, whatever you want to see. - Oh, yeah, weII, you know, whatever you wanna see, too. - Okay. - Yeah, I gotta go. Me too. We got a 2-1-2 on our end of the 6-0-5. I don't remember what that means. But, we will wait for you guys to come by, because they're leaving. - So, you ready? - I guess. - You scared? - A little. - I don't see why. What are you scared of? - I thought you didn't wanna do this? - When did I ever say that? - I don't know, I felt it. I just didn't understand all of this war stuff until thought about what Darren said. He's right, they deserve this! - Uh huh. I mean... - Manuel, Holden come in. You guys there? - Yeah, we're here. - Did you hear all of that? Yeah, we're on our way, man. - You know, we got it pretty good if you ask me. - Yeah, I can't believe how awesome the new clubhouse looks. -You,reacting much more IikeyourseIftoday. - How's that? - I mean, last night you seemed all out of it. - I was just wondering what would happen if Thomas... you know, heard, and what he would say. - Don't worry about that. It's no big deal. - Hey, speaking of Thomas, have you been noticing how he's being all Casanova around Gwen. - Yeah. Wait, what's Casanovious? It,s like when, a guy tries to beall smooth. Oh, yeah, that guy. - What are we waiting for? - Wait until Manuel and Holden get here. We got here earIy. Let's start the art before they come. - What color is this? - You don't get to go first. - Why? - Because I'm older. - So? - Both of you cut it out. - You can't do any thing with these anyway. - It's not spray paint. - Man, you did not get spray paint? You brought grease and air in a can. - Aw, man. -Everyone Iisten up. - This fort does not deserve to be here! - Yeah! - Look at it. - Did we do anything to them? - No! - Who started this? - They did! Thomas thinks he's better than us? They think they can do something to our fort? - Let,s bring this fort to the ground! - Yeah! Everyone back up! Let's finish this. - Now we can hold our heads high. This is our park. - Yeah! - Now we need to be ready for them to strike back. - We should make sure to place things closer together in the fort. We need some sort of defense. - What can I do? - You need to make us safe. - Hurry up. - I'm trying. - Guess what? Last night, after you left, I finally made my move. - Oh, geez. -I asked her out to amovie. - My littIe brother's growing up. - So what movie you going to see? - I don't know yet. - You don't know what movie you're going to see? - Not yet. I mean, I just asked her out. - Next time, figure out what movie you're going to see before you ask her out. - I'm not even talking to you anymore. - I know I pick on you sometimes. - Like calling me squirt, take my stuff without asking, blame me for things I didn't do... - Yeah, okay, now you're going a little too far. - Just a little. - You know, I'm just trying to be a big brother. - Are you nervous about going to junior high? - Not really. - I'd be nervous. - Why, it's all the same kids I'm in school with now? - Still, it's different. - It's only different if you let it be. - I still think you're braver than I am. - Oh, my God. - What happened? - I don't know why they would do something like this?! - What are you going to say to everyone? I don't know what to say. - What happened?! - They are gonna pay! - Our clubhouse! - What is this?! - What are you guys doing just standing here? We need to get... - Calm down. - Let Thomas talk. I don't know what to say. I mean... it's not like they were begging us to stay around or like we did something to their fort. - What are we gonna do now, guys? - I don't know why they did this. - I think we should go attack their fort now. - But they're still there. - Then we'll attack them, too. - There's more of us and we're bigger. - Yeah, and stronger. - We should... Guys, this is not what we did to get here. We avoided a big fight by building our own fort. That's what I'm saying. We need to attack back. - No, guys. This is between me and Darren. I'll go talk to him. - Isn't this about all of us? - Well, it is, but we need to talk about this man to man. - Let me come with you. - Naw. If I have to let you come I have to let everyone come. - But you can't go alone. - How do we know they won't hurt you? - Yeah, you should let us come just in case. No. You guys just stay here and clean up this mess. I'll come back with news on this. Thomas, be careful. Any questions? Okay. On this note, I would like to present our Chief of Defense, Stephen. Thank you. I now present to you Operation Mass Defense. - I think we should follow him. - Yeah, who knows what they might have planned for him? No! Let him go on his own! Everyone just stays here and helps me clean up! But don't you think that... No! No! No! Now let's get to work. It won't take that much time if we all work together. - You know this is all our fault. - Hey, I gotta go back and get something. As you can see, I already stationed Holden in the look out tower. Nick, ground patrol. Ramey and Jamie will guard a drawbridge. Someone's headed towards the fort! - Is everything okay? - Hey, squirt, did you find what you were looking for? - Thomas! - Is everything okay? Yeah, it went good. Um, we taIked, and it's all settled. We have our fort, and they have theirs. No more fighting. - So, I guess we'll just get started on our brand new fort tomorrow. - It was an old fort anyways. Yeah, I mean, it'll be like a whole new beginning for us. That should solve our problems for a while. I want everyone to report to defensive positions at 1500 hours. - Yes, sir. - When is that? - After school tomorrow. - Hey. - Hey. Why'd you run off? I wish that there wasn't any clubhouse or any club. - Jake, I took care of it. Didn't you hear what I told everyone? - Yeah, I heard. Well, I made it so everything's gonna be okay. I made it alright. - It's not good enough. - Hey, trust me, okay? C'mon, let's go home. - Hey. - Listen, I just came by to say I'm really sorry about your brother. None of us meant for it to go this far. Yeah. I talked to the guys. I'm calling together a meeting. The fort's yours just as much as it is mine. We want you guys to come back, girls and all. It's gone too far. We're having our meeting at five. We think it'd be really important if you come. Guys, guys! We're gonna have to start now. I was really hoping everyone would be here. Anyways, um, I think we all know why we're here. We gotta discuss what happened toJake yesterday... They're here! Jake! EngIish subtitIes by: Scott Landy
