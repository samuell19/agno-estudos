He's more my child than yours. My God... a woman must have something. Every woman's got to have... You've never talked like this before. Bobbie is the only thing in your life that you've ever given mine. You brought him to me when he was a helpless little baby, dependent on me for everything, and I loved him for just that.

We're a lucky people, but we've got to take a hard look at the future. There's a dark cloud looming over Brownville, and it begins and ends with the river. Every year that old river shifts and changes, and every year she overflows. And we shake our heads, and we clean up the mess, and we go right on like that's the way it should be. But we've got to face one thing. We can't count on that old river. What happens when the channel gets so shallow, a boat can't get through? When the steamboats can no longer come?

Thanks for the hand. Oh, would you like some sugar water? Can't be too sweet for me. Oh. It's real good. Yeah. When's the race going to start? Any minute, Mama. It's so dusty by the track.

Might just as well have told your helper, "No thank you." [crickets chirping] Well, Margie girl, what do you think the people thought about my speech? They loved it, of course. You're both trying to change the subject. Mama, how could you have spoken to Martin in that tone? Martin Dempster is a river rat. I remember when he was a little boy, he'd always run away. His father would find him down by the river. River boys do not take kindly to education. They're always hankering for the water. That's no reason to be mean. I don't want my only girl around a river rat. Not the daughter who's beautiful. Not the one who has a college education. That very education helps me to choose the right person. When God helped Noah build the Ark, he called them animals in two by two. Two ducks, two geese, two horses. They were always two of the same kind, side by side. The fact is, you don't know Martin at all. He is the truest person I know. He and I are exactly the same kind, and we're going to walk together, side by side.

[children laughing] As a matter of fact, I did live in that big house when thoseapple trees were blooming their hearts out. McIntosh, Cortlands, Pippins, sweet little pink-and-white Gravenstein apples that would make your cheeks curl from the tartness in their flesh. This old roily river town has a brilliant past, and now you children are the only ones who can save it. You must work and study to be the best that you can possibly be. [door opening] [door closing] Oh, there you are. You're staying later and later at that school. What about me? I'm hungry. I love you, too, Mama. Now, what shall I fix us for dinner? Doughnuts for dessert. [laughing] Yes, all right. I'll fix you rice doughnuts for dessert. With jelly inside, the way you like them. Just the way you used to make them for me when I was a child. Mmm. Remember? Mm-hmm. [humming] [gasping] Not now. What? You think you are going out looking for work, but you're wrong. I'm not in the mood, Aimée. Oh! Neither am I. I am not in the mood to have your baby today. As if the weather were not disagreeable enough without this... Oh! It hurts too much. I'll go get Dr. Pressler. Martin... what have you done to me? [groaning] [screaming] [birds chirping] Father used to send for it specially from New York. It's Earl Grey and mint, I believe. I can't imagine that I've ever had a finer tea. Mmm. This is the last of it. If anything good at all came from your father's death, I'd say I... am flattered that I've had the opportunity to know you. The problems you and your mother are being put through. The freeze, moving into thishouse. I'm sorry. Oh, I am sorry, too. No, no. I'm sorry that people have so little else to talk about. [chuckling] Uh, actually, I'm glad they've been talking so I can come up with my idea. My idea is that perhaps you might consider a union of sorts? Of what sort? I must not be making myself clear. I would like to take you as my wife. And take care of your mother, too, of course. I am proposing that we marry. Dr. Bennett... Luke... ... I do appreciate the thought, but I've come to accept my life. And I've always been a firm believer in the word "love." I don't think I've heard either one of us mention that word. [baby crying] Let's go out tonight. To the Mardi Gras Fete. I'll be out looking for a job. You won't find one around here hugging that baby. You could hug me for a change. [crying continues] Martin, I am sick of being stuck in this room. I'll come with you. You stay here and you take care of that boy, do you hear me? [crying continues] It's not fair to ask me to miss Mardi Gras. How do I look, Robert? Now you just do like I've been telling you. Keep on sleeping until I get back. I am just in need of a little excitement. So you take care of yourself. Martin shouldn't hide this from me. It's mine now. I would like to kiss you good-bye, but I don't want you to wake up.

There it is. Ball, Bobbie, throw it. Oh, he's strong. He's such a good boy. This is your father's river, Bobbie. He was the first baby born in Brownville. He loves this river more than anything. It's in your blood, little boy. I want you to get to know it early on. So you don't get swept up later like it's new and magical. It's just something to be reckoned with. [gasping] I love you.

[crickets chirping] Grandma's asleep. You're as tall as a willow sapling. I need to tell you a secret. But we mustn't tell Grandma yet. What? Your father loves you very much. Is he here? Well, I saw him earlier. He's talking about your living together. Where? Tell me. Down the river, in Kansas City. You, too? Well, Grandma and I would stay here. Of course, we could come and visit. I don't want to go away from you. I know. I'll miss you too much. Perhaps you'd like to go. Just a little. Maybe? No, I wouldn't. You must always do as your father says, Bobbie. But, Mama, I'm the only boy you've got. That's it, dear heart. You're the only boy I've got. [crickets chirping] [knocking] [knocking] Martin. Martin-- You stopped me this afternoon, but you won't stop me now. If I took Bobbie to Kansas City, I couldn't take him alone. There is somebody else I couldn't bear to be apart from. It's you, Margie. It's you. Why didn't you speak before? I've always been slow at life, like I was with books, Margie. I'm saying it now. I've been dreaming of you and wanting you all these years. You didn't know? I've been loving you all this time 'til my heart's near burst in me. Many's a time I've told that old river over and over again 'til even she seemed to understand. You'd have done better telling it to me, Martin. I was ashamed. I could never forget that letter I had to write you. You could have had a hundred better men than me. I'll never forget when that letter came. It was like signing my soul away. Perhaps you did. And you took mine as well. I have no right to ask you to forgive me. I had no right to... dream you'd wait for me. Every time you came to visit Bobbie... I dreamed and prayed you were coming for me. But it is you, Margie. I came for you. ♪♪ Martin, don't. Don't, I'm not the same anymore. [crying] It's all asleep in me. I'm too old. See how young you are. Oh, Martin. Come with me now. I'm afraid. It hurts. Of course it hurts, darling. Don't you suppose it hurts the river? Don't you know it hurts that old river when the spring floods come and muddy up the bottom... ... and tear a new channel through the sand? Of course it hurts. Of course it hurts. But I love you, woman. I do love you, Martin. ♪♪ ♪♪
