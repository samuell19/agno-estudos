In 1366, the 22nd year of the reign of the emperor Shun, oppression caused the people to rebel. Chu Yuan-Chang, of lowly bin'h, led an army of 100,000 men against the Yuan dynasty. Besides the war on the battlefields, spies from both sides intrigued against ea ch other. In charge of the Yuan armies was Lee Khan-- chief executive, legislator, and inspector general for Honan, Shensi, Shantung, and high lord of Honan. Lee Khan's power was second to none. He was a shrewd and cunning man and a superior swordsman with a cruel streak. His sister, Princess Lee Wan-erh, was his skilled companion. She had persuaded one of Chu Yuan-Chang's advisers to sell her Chu's war map for a large sum of money. He wants to meet with you personally in Shensi. But Chu's men learned of this and immediately sent word ahead to Shensi. What would you like to eat? Give me two buns. Lee Khan plans to come here. He will probably stay at Spring Inn. Hurry and tell Wan Jen-mi. Wan Jen-mi, be sure to get ready. Liu, do you know what brings Lee Khan here? No, but someone will contact you and tell you the whole plan. I must go. Do you know who they will send? No. You must be prepared for anyone. Has Lee Khan decided to stay here? There are no decent inns nearby, and Lee Khan shuns official residences. I'm sure he will stay here. If so, the emperor's officials will certainly notify me. Not necessarily. Lee Khan normally travels incognito. Sir. But he may send men in advance to make sure it is safe. You must be watchful. Your task may be very difficult. Your instructions are to get help. All right. I'll call for help immediately. SPRING INN SPRING INN I hear that Spring Inn has four new serving girls. That'll make business tough for us. Your regular customers will stay with you. I count on your support, Mr. Ho. You certainly have it. Would you like to order something? - A flask of wine. - Right away. Flask of wine! They have four charming serving girls and a gambling table. A gambling table? Just listen to me. So the Spring Inn's reopening? SPRING INN GAMBLING - LIQUOR - Customer! - It's me. Oh. This way please, sir. This way. We have a guest. Please have a seat. Sit down, please. What would you like to eat, sir? Don't mind me. A pot of tea will be fine. One pot of tea! Go and ask Wan Jen-mi to come down. Welcome. - A towel! - Coming up! - Keep the change. - Thanks! One string plus forty! Waiter! Corning, coming. What would you like? - Scallions and mutton, a flask of wine. - All right. Over there. Hey, what's this? I'm not allergic to salt. A little bland? "A little bland" is right. There's no salt at all. I'll get you another. - What would you like, sir? - Have a couple of drinks with me. This isn't that kind of place. You've really got a lively place here. The girls attract a full house every day. Are you sure you can trust them? Don't worry. They love the idea of killing Mongols. I checked into their backgrounds. I hear they all have a shady past. I know, but they were poor and couldn't do anything else. I hear this Lilac used to be a bandit. I'm afraid her temper may cause trouble. Not at all. Damn it! Now you've drowned it in salt! You're very difficult to please! - What's going on here? - Damn it! This inn is cursed. - Calm down, calm down! - If you don't like it, then get out! - You'd better watch your mouth. - What? - Shut up! Go get another dish. - Take it easy. I'm sorry, sir. I've scolded her properly. - Here she is again! - I don't care who you are! Didn't I warn you? Get out of here. Please don't be angry. She was very rude. - No, but-- - Don't be angry. I'll buy you a drink. Please allow me. They all ought to be like you. Look at that sourpuss! - Where are you taking this? - To that old bumpkin. Hey! Innkeeper, where's my food? Hurry up with the food for this table. It's coming up. - Bring it here! - Okay! Give me that. - Here it is. - As quick as that? This isn't yours. This was for those two bumpkins. - Hey, miss! - Here! Corning, coming. What about the food I ordered, miss? It's coming right up. That plate of mutton was mine. Yes, it was, but I couldn't give it to you. Why not? There was a fly in it. How could I give you food with a fly in it? He's eating food that has a fly in it. Get the bumpkins another plate of mutton. Hey, come here. Come, let me introduce you. This is Mr. Liu. - This is Peony. - Pleased to meet you, Mr. Liu. - Is this one the pickpocket? - Yes. - I hope she doesn't revert to old habits. - Certainly not. Come right in. Customer! I hear you've got a new gambling table here. - Yes. Do you want to try your luck? - Why not? This way, please. What would you like to eat? - Do you have date cakes? - Of course. Gentlemen, do you mind if I join you? - Whose is this? - The old man at the gambling table. Give it to me. - Sir, here is your wine. - Put it here. Excuse me. - Pardon me. - All right. Miss Wan. Give it back to him. How can I? Corning. Hey. Let me take this. Gentlemen, I'll be the banker. Put your bets down. Oh! I'm sorry. Let me get that. Sir, I can't reach under your foot. I'll get it myself. Did I hurt you? That's all right. I can take it. Enjoy yourself. - You're sure to win. - Wait for the tip. Four-five-six! Four-five-six! Look at him, trying so hard that his head spins around. What do you think you're doing? Your hands are so delicate. I can't bear to see them doing rough work. You're really a smooth talker. I mean it. If I don't, you're my mother. I wish I were so fortunate. Damn, you're picking on me. Cut it out. What was that about? The dirty old man can't keep his hands to himself. Stay calm. We can't afford any trouble. Don't worry. Oh, boy! No one makes a move! Put your money on the table. Friends, if you need money, just say so. Don't draw your swords. Get the till first. Forgive us, ladies. It won't happen again. The hell with that! We should chop you to pieces. - Lock them up in the back. - Move! - Off you go! - Hurry up! Continue with your gambling. These girls really know how to fight. Amazing. A fight in the middle of a nice meal. Sorry. I'll get you another. - I'm leaving. - Stay a little longer. No, I have business to look after. Our man will soon be here. You must be alert. Nice to see you, Honorable Ha. Who is this? The local magistrate. What's kept you away so long? Lots of work to do. I hear that this place has become a whorehouse. Bullshit. Then what are these beautiful girls here for? They're my serving girls. - Go on up. I'll be right there. - Please hurry. You seem to know the Mongol official very well. With him covering for us, we don't have any trouble. Have you noticed anything? Not yet. Be patient. Take another look around. Is he going to be in the way? He's an idiot. That's good. I'm told that Lee Khan has also sent people here, so you'd better be careful. Have a seat. - What can I get you? - A flask of wine and dish of beef. Flask of wine and one dish of beef! You're at it again. Is this your first time here? What kind of work do you do? I do a bit of this and that. Where are you from? The capital. How long will you be here? That depends. Wan Jen-mi, I'm leaving. Where are you going? I have work to do at the ministry. Why spend time at that crummy place? Knock it off. - Sir, you-- Jnnkeepefl Jnnkeepefl - Coming. I need change. - Four-five-six! - One-two-three! Four-five-six! One-two-three! Business is tough Times are hard But restaurants make money all the same Dilute the wine with water Serving rotten fish and meat Reheating left-over rice It satisfies your craving for food But it's sure to give you the runs No need for purgatives Don't misunderstand me, miss. None of that! I'll pay for everything I eat and drink. - Please don't pull on me. - Get out! This is new. You've torn it. I can pay. - See what he wants to eat. - All right. Hey. What do you want to eat? What do you think I like? How would I know what you like? A flask of wine and a bowl of noodles. One flask of wine, one bowl of noodles. Four-five-six! One-two-three! Even gamblers don't like crooks But cheating goes on all the time Dice are filled with lead Stop being a pest! Don't get upset Gambling makes you lose Both your money and your temper Get lost. Damn it. What's all this trouble? This gentleman curses me He has a short temper But I don't blame him He's uneducated And his parents didn't raise him properly Keep quiet! Leave him alone. Just ignore him. I can serve you up a good song. - What are you doing here? - Don't pull on me. You should be drinking instead of singing. Who's going to pay for this if you don't let me sing? - You had better be able to pay. - I don't have any money. Then you shouldn't have ordered anything. If you let me sing, I'll make some money. You-- If we keep getting customers like you, we might as we" close down. Customers! Come in, please. Huh? More of them? This way, please. What can I get you? A flask of wine and two bowls of noodles. A flask of-- You're not going to start singing, are you? What? Nothing. A flask of wine and two bowls of noodles! Four-five-six! Leopards! Bank wins! Gentlemen, may I join you? Sure. The more the merrier. The more you bet, the more you win. Ready. Hands clear from the table. Are you betting it all? That's your bet? Didn't he say bet more and win more? Okay. Pay up according to the rules. - Four-five-six! - One-two-three! Where did he get to? One-two-three! One-two-three! Leopards! Bank wins. Here's your wine. I'll have it later. I'm busy. They're all one and the same. You really are a nuisance. Finish this glass of wine. Why should I drink it? If you don't, you're insulting me. How can a serving girl drink with the customers, sir? No, but we're friends. Drink up, and I'll buy you a gold bracelet. I'll have that drink if you let go of my hand. - Then you must have a drink. - All right. - Towel! - Coming. Why did you put your hand in your food? Too much to drink? Sir. - That girl really has a lot of spirit. - She's a handful. Here, here. I don't see anything suspicious. Take another look around. - Here. - Cheers. I'll go back over there. Waiter. Where can I wash up? That way. I think there's something not right here. How can you talk like that? Damn it. Something's wrong with the dice. Watch your tongue. If you can't take a loss, then leave. Damn it! Did you tell me to leave? I did indeed! And what of it? Calm down. I want another set of dice. Why be so troublesome when everyone is enjoying themselves? Just change the dice and stop this arguing. Get a new set of dice. Bet more and win more. I don't want that. Change the dice, madame. Corning. Look, everybody, I didn't win much. - Listen to him. He hasn't won much. - What exactly is the matter? Nothing, nothing. Shun, what are you doing? Get out of here. Put your bets down. Four-five-six! One-two-three! Six! Looks like I'm a winner. Look at the table. He's winning more than I am. I don't understand why you pick on me. He wins because he's lucky. You win by trickery. You're slandering me! Prove it, or I'm not through with you! Not through with me? Who do you think you are? Then what are you? I wasn't cheating. All right, quiet down. Gambling means either winning or losing or breaking even. - But he's cheating! - Say that again! What's this about cheating? That old man must be a crook. Let's go over together. I'll be the bank. Put your bets down. It's not your turn yet. Keep quiet. Why not let him be the bank? Come on then. The more you bet, the more you win. Let him, so we can recoup our losses. Bet, bet. Small, small. What do you mean by this? These all came out of your pocket. Relax. It's nothing. So it's this guy. One never knows. He has all the money. You dare to try this here? Return the money and get out quick. I'll kill anyone who comes near me. Throw them out. You and I will get out by the back door. Make way, gentlemen, for the blade spares no one. The bag! Listen to me, sir. Get away, you stinking beggar. Come on, sir, why play around with that sword? Why did you make trouble for me? Don't move! Gambling is allowed, but not cheating. Leave your bag behind, and I'll let you go. Shun, bring him over. Never try this nonsense again. Next time-- I wouldn't dare. Let them go. Thank you very much. Go! - Sorry. - It's all right. Sorry. Continue with your gambling. Sorry. Sorry. Friend, you do know something. What about this? Return it to the gambling table. You took care of that old fellow easily enough. Another flask of wine. One flask of wine! - Sorry if we scared you just now. - No problem. Your serving girls are superb. This kind of thing happens all the time in our business. - Don't pull on me. - Here you are again! It's new. A cup of good liquor Drives away all sorrows One flask of wine Can make you light on your feet! Two flasks will make you do somersaults Enough. Get out of here. One more song and I can buy myself a drink. Don't sing. I'll buy you the drink. Why should I let you pay? Hey! I'll make up the difference. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. - Now you should have enough. - I do. I do. You don't have to sing now. No, madame. And this is for you. Is it enough to cover the drinks? Of course. Madame, what do we do about him? Move him into one of the rooms. - Shun, come and help. - I'm coming. Let me drink. What are you doing to me? Mr. Wang, why is Lee Khan coming here? I hear he has to meet someone. Who? There's a spy in the camp of General Chu. He has seen the general's war map. - Who? - Shen Tien-hsiung. - That's General Chu's adviser. - Right. What should we do now? - We still need to wait. - Who for? That person will contact us himself when the time is right. Mr. Wang, you can stay upstairs for the time being. Yuan San, come with me. I want to talk to you. This way. - You pretend to be the cook. - I understand. Wan Jen-mi, someone passed out in the washroom. Oh, no. Quick, get the medicine. There's no need for that. He was sent by Lee Khan. I've seen him in the capital, so I took care of him earlier. Take him outside and bury him. I think that drunkard is with him. That's not likely. He's too drunk. We just carried him into the other room. This fellow is Wen Mei-Chi, a famous Southern thief. It's not clear what he's up to now. - Where is he? - Inside here, sleeping. He was there just now. He couldn't have gotten far. We'll talk tomorrow. Let's go. I better leave early tomorrow. Go! - Who sent you? Speak up! - Nobody. Speak up! I was sent by His Highness. -"Highness," my ass. You groveling dog! - Lee Khan. Why did he send you here? To see if you were plotting against him. If you let me go, I'll tell him that you are loyal subjects. Cut the nonsense! How many of you are there? Five. Who are the other four? One came in with me. Is that Ho Shao-Chi? That's the one they just carried out. Who are the other three? They came as the robbers today to see if you could fight. They're tied up out back. - They've run away. - Did you let them go? - Yes'? - Yes. I've told you everything. Please spare me. Open the door! Put him with Ho Shao-Chi. It's me! What took you so long? - What are you doing up so late? - I missed you. Nonsense. Why are you up so late? I have a relative who came looking for a job. I'll introduce him to you. Cousin. - This is Honorable Ha. - Honorable Ha. This is my cousin. This is his servant. My cousin will keep the accounts here. - I'm going upstairs with Honorable Ha. - All right. You two send those two drunkards home. - Is he really your cousin? - Of course! How can he be an impostor? I mean, he had better not be an old lover of yours. You better not cheat on me. I'll look like a fool. I wouldn't have to go to all that trouble to make you look like a fool. So you'll never cheat on me? I can't say for sure. I'll bury that one. You go after the other three. Right. - Wake up. - What's the matter? It's late. His Highness must have already passed through town. Let's go. Who's playing music in this desolate place? - Liu Hsan-fu. - What? Come inside, please. Here's the cash book, the ledger... and the petty cash. Mr. Wang, can you really do the books? I'll just pretend, but it'll look real enough. - What would you like? - I'll tell you in a minute. - How about you? - Dumplings. Let me serve this table. - Get me some change. - Yes, sir. This way, please. Change this. In the drawer down there. It's all taken care of. Go and get some rest. Welcome. Customers! Anybody going to serve us? What do you want? Wine, of course. - Come back. - What for? I haven't finished. What's the hurry? Send a flask of wine to my men at the bottom of the hill. Wait! Did you hear what I told you? There's nobody to send. Ask them to come up for it. Nobody to send? Has everyone died? Watch your tongue! How dare you talk to me like that? Sorry. We'll take it out right away. - Shun. - Yes? - Two flasks of wine, right? - Yeah. Take two flasks of wine down the hill. - Down the hill? - Go on. Hurry. See what they want to eat. What will you have? Four dishes to go with the wine. Commander, these girls don't show us any respect. No respect. Let's tear the place up and then pull down the inn. Idiot! How can we drink after tearing the place up? First let's eat and drink to our fill. Great. Cheers. The commander is always right. Drink up, then break it up. With our commander's clever strategy and shrewd tactics, we can't fail. Cut it out. This is nothing. Watch me get some money to spend. Come on! Bet a lot, win a lot! Let me throw the dice. Four-five-six! Four-five-six! One-two-three! Too bad. You lose. Lose? Never. One and two and three are six. I win! - What kind of figuring is that? - Let them be. - You-- - I can't afford any trouble with them. Look at this. It was a sure thing. Our commander always wins. That's what he has-- the talent of a general. Liar! You ass-kisser. The commander is lucky. Let's fill up. Cheers? To our commander. The commander said to bring you this wine. It's a long way down. Damn it. How can one flask be enough? Bring two more flasks and some food to go with it. Brother. What's the matter? Please bring us some water. Hey! Hurry up, you bastard. Wait! Let's be off. Wait. You haven't paid yet. Listen, we're on official business. Nobody dares ask us for money. Leave it. But you have to pay here. Two strings plus forty. She even knows how to do somersaults. Look, they both have really pretty faces. - Two strings plus forty isn't expensive. - Not at all. Two strings plus forty. Okay? But you'll have to sleep with our commander. All right? Stop! Fuck off! Damn! You must be tired of living. - Let's tear this place apart! - Tear it apart! Stop it! What do you think you're doing? - It's nothing. - What do you mean nothing? They refused to pay and then started breaking up the place. What are you going to do about it? And, anyway, who are you? I'm the innkeeper here. You've come to the wrong place. We're running a cash business, not handing out loans. I don't care. I'll tear the place apart. Tear it apart! What are you standing there for? My lord. What are you trying to do? We are here to-- The magistrate is asking what we're doing here. Didn't the commander tell us to practice our martial arts? Right, practice. They're practicing. You must be blind! First they eat and drink, then break up my shop. Don't you have any control over them? Yes, of course. - You bastards! - Yes, we are. The government pays you to maintain peace and order. But you eat without paying and assault people. You abuse His Majesty's generosity and the orders I gave you. You, you're good for nothing! - Get out! - Sir! Two strings plus forty. - Pay her. - Me? Pay for your drinks next time. Understand? We understand. - We'll follow the rules next time. - Let's go. Just a minute! - Commander. - I'm not worthy. You can gamble here, but you can't steal. - We wouldn't dare! - I didn't-- Don't act innocent! Return the money! Hurry and give back the money. Wait. Don't forget your feather. Thank you. Commander, the men below ordered four more dishes. Tell them to eat their big toes! Let's go. Nothing is the matter. Thank you. Sorry, sorry. - This is yours. - Thank you. This is yours. - You seem to have fights every day. - Please excuse us. His lordship seems to know your madame well. Friends. Only friends. - Say something to them. - Say what? Gentlemen! Gentlemen, sit down please. Those bastards-- Those bastards stole food and drink... and also upset your game. It was my fault for not teaching them better. In the future-- In the future, if any government servant bullies you-- please inform me. All right? - And what's more... - What's more? And what's more, this place will have no more trouble. Just feel free to drink and gamble. If anyone cause trouble within a hundred miles, I'll-- - Who's this? - His Highness. The magistrate of Hiang Yi wishes Your Highness and the princess well. Who here works at the inn? Don't move. Show your hands. Go on playing. Go on. You may rise. Stand up. Those who do not work in the inn are excused. Let's go. Magistrate. - At your service! - Rise and answer. - Sire. - Do you oversee this place? - Yes. I want to stay here for a few days. I'll have an official residence prepared immediately. No. I'll stay here at the inn. Your Highness, this place is too crude. Wouldn't Your Highness and the princess prefer to move into my residence? Officials must be close to the people in order to know their troubles. - Isn't that right? - Yes, yes. Your Highness speaks truly. Your Highness and the princess may rest in the room upstairs. Your Highness, the rooms facing the courtyard are quieter and more spacious. - Do you know this area well? - Yes, yes. Do you know the people well, too? Your Highness, I've been here for years. I know the people well. There is no cause for Your Highness to worry. Who is that? He is-- He is the innkeeper's cousin. How long has he been here? He arrived just yesterday. And you already know him so well? Be honest with His Highness from now on. Sire. Who is that over there? He is the innkeeper's servant. No-- A servant. No-- The bookkeeper's servant. - Rise. - Sire. Is it tranquil around here? With Your Highness's blessing, the place is tranquil. Any robberies, extortion, or soldiers bullying the citizens? None. Are there any rebel spies? None! I've always been on the alert for spies. They dare not show up here. What a surprise. I've just located one. - Bring him in. - Sire. Bring him in. Do you know this man? I do not know him, Your Highness. Look carefully. Look again. Your Highness, I really don't know him. He used to work for Chu Yuan-Chang. Now he's operating within your area. I should be punished. Tell everyone to leave, except for the innkeeper. You can all go now, but the innkeeper stays here. This proves that your investigation was not carried out thoroughly. Liu is no ordinary man. He must have others working under him. Be alert. I Will! Innkeeper, you probably knows this Liu, right? - Yes. - You-- They are both innkeepers. They must know each other. Innkeeper, I'm sorry to inconvenience you. I'm honored. - You needn't attend us any longer. - Of course. How would you dispose of this Liu? The law says he must be beheaded. So be it. - Drag him out and behead him. - Sir! Lee Khan, you son of a bitch! Lee Khan, you shall have no children! Magistrate. - Sire! Your territory is not so tranquil. I am to blame. I should be punished. Alert your men. I'll look around myself tomorrow. Your Highness. Princess. - Is everything done? - All is done. - Do you think this area is tranquil? - Quite tranquil. I've caught a few soldiers bullying the citizens. Whose soldiers? They serve under the local magistrate, Haraku. Haraku! How do you think this matter should be handled? As Your Highness commands. What do you think, Wan-erh? The law calls for beheading. Isn't that too severe? Executing one serves as a warning to the rest. Very well. - Where are they? - Outside. - Bring them in. - Sire. Bring the men in. Sir! Bring them here. Spare me, Your Highness! Spare me, Your Highness! Is there anything else? Is Your Highness going to stay here? I'm afraid this place is suspicious. Explain what you mean. There are two strangers at this inn. You go ahead to the room. You've checked carefully. Since there are strangers here, I want to question them individually. Proceed. Magistrate. - Yes, sir. - Guards! - Sir! - Bring the innkeeper in. - Sir. Be careful what you say. - What's your name? - Wan Jen-mi. - Your real name! - Wan Hsiu. But I seldom use this name. They all call me Wan Jen-mi. Why did you suddenly add two new workers? - We were short of hands. - Short of hands? With His Highness arriving? How could that be? I didn't know His Highness was coming. - What did these two do before? - They were merchants. - What is their relation to you? - One of them is my cousin. Go! Quickly! Sir. The other one is his servant. Did you know Liu was a traitor? How could I know that? How could you not know? You've known him a long time. No, I really didn't. Listen, don't think you can fool me. Even those four serving girls have suspicious backgrounds. Think it over carefully. I'll deal with you later. Leave! - Guard. - Sir! - Place her in that room. - Sir! Move! Magistrate. - Sir! - Bring the bookkeeper. - At once! You! Go on! - Where are you from? - The capital. - What are you doing here? - Working for my cousin. What did you do before this? Tell me the truth. - I was a merchant. - Nonsense! I can't help it if my lord refuses to believe me. How dare you! Tell the truth. Do you know kung-fu? No. Show me your hands! - Put him in that room. - At once! Magistrate! Bring that man in. - Sir! Get in there! - Brother Wang, how are you? - I'm all right. - Our man is here. - What? There are three rules. One, your people cannot go upstairs. Two, no one goes out without my permission. Three, no one else is allowed to enter. Three more things. Kill Lee Khan, steal the war map, and catch Shen Tien-hsiung alive. Do you understand? Understood. Got it? Remember, nobody's allowed to go upstairs. Your Highness. Princess. Rise. What about the inn's people? Is there anyone suspicious? I've checked them thoroughly. What about the two new ones? One is the innkeeper's cousin. The other is his servant. They came here because of the drought. Fine. Tell the magistrate to lead the way. It's him. - I'm honored, Princess. - Welcome, Lord Shen. This way, please. Shen Tien-hsiung pays Your Highness his respects. Rise. Lord Shen, how was the trip? You've brought it, I suppose. I have brought it. Please review it, Your Highness. Good. Lord Shen has performed a great service for our empire. I shall return to the capital tomorrow and recommend that His Majesty reward you. I thank Your Highness. There are spies everywhere. They may cause you trouble. So I won't keep you any longer. Thank you, Your Highness. I beg to take my leave. Do you think that's right? Allowing this sort of man to live is dangerous. - Tsao Yu-Kun. - At your service. Your Highness, I couldn't find Shen Tien-hsiung. Why do you tell me this? Keep on searching. Of course. I think the war map is in his box. - Leave that to me. - All right. We must find Shen and hide him. I'll go. He'll go out early in the morning. - Try to delay him. - Right. My lord, the madam, my employer, offers you some wine. My Lord, the madam, my employer says-- From now on, don't offer wine to our men. Yes, my lord. If they won't drink it, put it back. Master, put the books away. Let's play a game of Go. I don't have any time. - Shun, come and play Go. - All right. - Do you know how to play? - No. - Get lost. - You can teach me. Go away. - Do you want to play against me? - No. I'm playing against him. - What about the two guards outside? - It's all fixed. Let's go. - Good-bye. - Come back soon. Hey! What are you doing? - I'm going out. - Don't move. Nobody can leave without Lord Tsao's permission. - I have to bring money to my mother. - Not allowed. Tell me-- Hey. Hey! When will Lord Tsao return? I don't know. My mother will starve if I don't go! That's your problem. My lord, I must go. I'm the only provider in the family. My mother, my younger brothers, my younger sisters-- I don't want to hear about your family. I'll hurry and come back fast. - I'll be back in an hour, all right? - No. I'll just sneak out, and nobody will know. If you let me go, I'll have a drink with you tonight. - Nonsense. - Will you shut up? - What's the matter? - And when we finished drinking-- - Don't give me that. - You really are hopeless. - My lord, where is your wife? - I'm not married. I'll be your matchmaker. I have a cousin. There's no point going on like this. Nobody can leave before Lord Tsao returns. You'll have to wait. But I really have to go. I'll ask His Highness why I can't see my mother. Don't talk any nonsense when His Highness returns. - Then you'll let me go? - No. I'll bet if you let me go now, Lord Tsao will say it's fine when he returns. Maybe so, but you can't go right now. You know, yours is a difficult job. I'd be bored to death if I were you. When His Highness is at home, you have to wait on him. And when he's out, you still have to wait on him. Stop this bullshit. I say, look at that. The two officers in there are playing Go. What are you doing here all on your own? How about this? Let's throw the dice. If you win, I won't go. If you lose, you let me go. Nonsense! You really are stubborn. No one will know if I go out for a while. No. All right, I won't go. Didn't you say you were going? Why should I stand around here? Hey! Go outside. That's a good move. - Or you could move here. - Stop interfering! - Have you got it? - Let's see it. - Oh, no. - What is it? - This is a personal letter. - What do we do? Lord Tsao! Your Highness. Have you got it? There was no war map in the box, just this letter. - Return this letter fast. - They've come back. How can we? Lord Tsao, His Highness is asking for you. Your Highness. There's nothing else to do here. Prepare to return to the capital tomorrow. Sire. Wan Jen-mi, I have an idea. What is it? That won't work. It's too dangerous. There's no time to think about that. We have to hurry. I hear you're involved with the innkeeper... intimately. This is all my fault. I don't care about this little dalliance. But spend more time attending to your duties in the future. - Pay more attention to local affairs. - Of course. - Lord Tsao asks for an audience. - Enter. Your Highness, everything is ready. Fine. Wan, give the innkeeper five taels of gold. Yes. Your Highness, I've already paid her. Who gave you permission? His Highness Tsa-pun ordered it, so as not to bother Your Highness with trivial matters. He is very considerate. Who's singing? Your Highness, it's the bookkeeper's servant. I'll tell him to stop. No, wait. Pading tears in the eyes - Let him sing. - Yes. He sings well. This is "Kwan Han-ching's Farewell Song." Good. They've heard that Your Highness and the princess are leaving. They must be a bit sad. Have him called up here to sing for us. It may not be proper to sing in here. - Then we'll go downstairs and listen. - That's a good idea. In a small world A sudden half moon and flying petals A farewell cup in hand Pading tears in the eyes Just time to say Fare thee well Fare thee well How it hurts It's unbearable It's unbearable But then go For the future is awaiting Who told you to come in? Speak. What are you doing in here? I-- I was going to change your bed sheets. Where are the bed sheets? I-- I forgot to bring them up. What nerve. Tsao Yu-Kun. At once! Give the order. I'm not leaving tomorrow. Someone has forced the lock. Stealing jewelry? Not likely. The two newcomers at the inn? The bookkeeper and his servant? It couldn't be. Stealing the letter? It couldn't be. Tsao Yu-Kun? We went downstairs to listen. - The war map! - The war map! - Tsao Yu-Kun, sit down. - Thank you, Your Highness. Magistrate. - Sire! I've observed that although you have little ability... yet you know your place. I'll recommend you for a promotion. How is that? Thank you, Your Highness! Jnnkeepen - Yes? How much do you make in a day? More than ten taels of silver. How much did Tsao Yu-Kun give you? Five taels of silver. He was being stingy. My stay has upset your business and forced you to hire more people. Your Highness, we were short of hands already. You don't have to say that. For all this trouble, magistrate-- Sire! ...compensate the innkeeper with 200 taels of silver. Of course. Quickly. Thank His Highness. Thank you, Your Highness. Wan-erh, show your generosity as well. Give this bag of jewelry to the serving girls. Add a hundred taels of silver for the girl that died. Give her a good burial. Thank you, Princess. Bookkeeper, come here. At once. - Let the innkeeper withdraw. - Sire. Innkeeper, you may leave. Yes. Bookkeeper, what is your name? My name is Wang Chun. Wang Chun, after these few days, I find that you are a learned man. Have you passed your exams? Your Highness, I only entered the school last year. I see. Then this is no place for you. I know my limits, and I have no great ambitions. You are a humble man. Some talents are not discovered, and some talents... are not revealed. Do you agree? Your Highness is perceptive. The empire needs learned men. I'll give you an official appointment. What do you think? I'm afraid that I'm not qualified. If I say you're qualified, then you are. Let's do this. You take over Haraku's job here as the magistrate. I would be terrified. Quickly. Thank His Highness. Why are you reluctant to accept? I am Han. Besides... - If I don't mention it, who else dares to? - Yes, but-- Wang Chun, thank His Highness! Thank you, Your Highness. Very good. All of you may rise. I hope you'll prove to be worthy of my decision. I shall never forget this. Good. I have something for you to do now. Do you accept? However difficult it may be, I shall try my best. Good. Wang Chum, do you know that Chu Yuan-Chang's spies are in this inn? This... is something I am too ignorant to know. I know... that someone secretly opened my box. Go to the kitchen and tell them to be ready. Wang Chun, do you know who did it? I do not know. Of course, it is difficult to blame you. - Tsao Yu-Kun. - Sire! - How about you? - I don't know. An oversight in spite of such strong security. This traitor is smart. - Wang Chun. - Sire! He knows my box contains the army's command orders and secret papers. This traitor... is your servant, Sha Yun-shan! Come here! Your Highness, I was downstairs serving you. I've never even been upstairs. How could I-- Shut up! - Wang Chun, come here. - Sire. You're now a government official, and he is a traitor. Strangle him in my presence. Your Highness, She has been with me a long time. And I know him well. He wouldn't dare do a thing like that. I plead with Your Highness to review the matter. I've investigated the matter thoroughly. Execute him. - Your Highness-- - No more words! What are you waiting for? Sir. Master, you know me. I'm innocent. Don't argue. Accept your sentence. Master, how can you do this to me? Your Highness, I'm innocent! I'm innocent! I have long known about your treasonous intrigue! Drop your weapons, and His Highness will spare your lives. And if you repent, His Highness will provide you with a livelihood. Consider it seriously. Inn staff, you had better stand clear. Wang Chun, how about it? How do we know you'll keep your word? Right. If you take three steps back, I'll come up. Protect His Highness. I'll shield the princess. Sir! Watch out! The war map is in the bag at his waist. Hurry! You must get that bag. I want to get the princess alive. You go around to the back. You ungrateful dog! Shun! Get the sword out of his hand. Be careful! I'm coming! Don't come over here! Don't worry about me. Don't move! Wan Jen-mi, drop your bow and come over here slowly. Wang Chun, drop your sword. Tell Wan Jen-mi not to try any tricks. Wan Jen-mi! Walk over here. Your Highness. Tsao Yu-Kun, get troops here fight away. Then tell the magistrate to block all the roads and gates. Give her to me. Lee Khan! Tsao Yu-Kun, you traitor! Lee Khan, you still have time to save yourself. Release the princess first. First you hand over the map. What? You must be dreaming. Very well. You must free Peony first. - Let the princess loose first. - Don't worry about me! Keep quiet! Free them together. All right. Untie her. Set her free. Stop her! Brother Tsao. I'm fine. Wan-arm! Now!
