[WIND HOWLING] VERN TALLMAN [OVER RADIO]: This is Vern Tallman, at the County Weather Station with tonight's forecast. A weak cold front is moving across the Panhandle, so we can expect it to be getting cloudy and windy by this evening. Temperature in the 50s. I don't reckon you folks down in the valley ought to start worrying about your smudge-pots just yet, but if I had a new foal, I'd keep him in the barn tonight. Oh, and there's an 80 percent chance of rain. Know what? It's a lot nicer out in Waco, San Anton, Houston, or even Lubbock. But this is Vern Tallman telling you to have a nice evening anyway, hear?

Thanks for remembering The Alamo. Now, before we put on tonight's feature, let's take a few seconds to see that the rowdyism of last weekend-- I was hoping we'd get in fast, before Glowie meets some other feller. We? Well, I gotta watch you two. I gotta look and learn. I got lots to learn. ANNOUNCER: Anyone can pull the speaker if the box says "speaker." Dear Lord, keep them greedy, avaricious, no-good business men from beating us downtrodden out of our money. Leave only your parking lights on. When walking to and from the snack stand, keep your voices down. Let the folks enjoy themselves. Keep all your beer bottles and your beer cans inside your car. No throwing them out. Having a good time? Mm-hm. Then you're gonna stay down here, right? Mm-hm. Until Glowie shows up. What? Brothers are supposed to share, aren't they? Share? Then my fist is gonna share your mouth with your teeth. You're scared you'll goof up your one chance to score on some easy leg and you don't want no witnesses. Well, don't hurry back. Back? Back to what? Who sits in the bleachers with no ballgame going on. Come on, we got to look for Diddle Brown now. That Diddle Brown's a shrewd dude. I sure hope they here, 'cause I can't wait to do some stomping. Looky there! Orville's car. Ah-ha. Well, he's dessert. We keep him for last. Right now, just keep looking for the main course. Believe me, I have lived long enough to see plenty of cheapskates. But you, you take the cake. You take your own mother out once a month. Can't it be to church? Or at least to a good restaurant? But no, my son, the big spender, brings me to an old drive-in. And look at you, rich enough to be a national park. Oh, if only they'd had the pill when I was young. ANNOUNCER: Please remember that the back row is patrolled in order to discourage any behavior inconsistent with our family policy. Now, y'all enjoy the show, you hear? [INSTRUMENTAL FLOURISH PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] Oh, well, it's a New Year's Eve champagne flight for fun lovers. Break out the horns and the hats. What kind do you want? Not for me, for the passengers.

STEWARDESS [ON SPEAKER]: Traffic control! Traffic control! This is flight 747. Stewardess? What are doing on the radio? CAPTAIN: This is Sherman Vance. A mad bomber wiped out the entire crew. Well, we make the 11:00 o'clock news again tonight. FORD [IN FILM]: Vance, listen carefully. My name is Ford. I'm in charge of Rio Airport. I've worked out a plan. There's a helicopter standing by outside. They got 50 feet of rope. We're gonna tie one end to the chopper, I'm gonna hang on to the other. Because of the difference in air speed, we'll have one chance to swing that hole on the plane. How's that sound? VANCE: It would be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. Spoon, you and Alabama go check out the snack bar and see if Little Brown's got here yet. MAN [IN FILM]: All these cheap shortcuts to construction. For instance, no stairs-- Stairs are old-fashioned. What idiots are gonna walk up 196 floors? Guys, listen, my ladders only go to the 2nd floor. Hello, Mrs. Hedson. This is Enoch. Can I speak to Glowie please? Oh? Well, who did she go with? Oh, sorry.

You've done a great job, Margo. Now prepare for landing. MARGO: Oh, no! Look! BILL HILL: People that love each other do get married every now and then. Marriage ain't what's happening no more for a woman my age. Bill Hill, I have seen first hand. Marriages this young just don't work. Oh... Their lives are lost like beads off on a string. Not ours. In a couple of years, we buy a decent house with real grass out front. Not indoor-outdoor carpet. Ain't that what every woman wants? Reasoning with a woman is like eating soup with a fork. [EMERGENCY VEHICLE SIRENS BLARING IN FILM] When are we gonna stomp that Orville? Now. Bring him back so we can see how he plans to fix my door, with his money or his blood.

MAN 1: Look, someone's still alive. Where are you going, Orville? Sorry, I didn't see you. Get yourself a white cane. I said I was sorry. Jeez. MAN 1: I've got to get upstairs. Dedication of my new building starts in 10 minutes. MAN 2: I'll lend a hand here, sir. After all, I am the captain. MAN 1: No. No. You come with me. Hi, Orville. You come looking for me? That's right. Go on home without me, girls. Orville will see I get home, won't you? I'll see that she gets home. If anybody can make a live one out of him, it's Glowie. Yeah, but it'll be trickier than diapering Siamese twins. Shh! We got to see if Harriet's gonna bake this cake for Ozzie. We're in the den, dear. Let them sit down before you grab it off his back. Hi. Hi. Where have you been? Oh, Thorny and I took a little stroll down to Miller's and got a chocolate malted. What? I got people stationed at both exits. Ain't but one way Diddle Brown and the Gear Grinders'll get out. Ambulance. You know, that turkey what hit our van is here too. Who? Orville. BOTH: Orville? We've seen him over there.

That's all. If I'd touched your hand earlier, I'd have known how sensitive you are. Well, how come? 'Cause it's sexy, and real soft. No, it ain't all that soft. What ain't? My hand. Ain't that what you was talking about? Do you wanna kiss me? Well, yeah, sure. But it ain't fair to Enoch. Orville, hear me good. Enoch's out, and you're in. Or about to be. [RAIN STOPS] Look, it stopped raining. [CAR TOP SQUEAKING] You gay? What? I ain't prejudiced if you are. Well, I ain't. I mean, if you are gay, no hard feelings. No hard feelings. Get it?
