[Speaking native language] Spirit of life, spirit of nature, give these shells magical powers. [Speaking native language] Bring to life the great waters, the healing power of aloe ve-rat. [Speaking native language] Beneath the city of glass and steel, let the magic flow with the watering to the paws of those who need the aloe ve-rat. Oh, it's so enchanting. Buenos días, señora. No, no. I not buy trinkets. I little time. I catch boat to New York. Comprende? Manhattan. Manhattan? Lady, I am not selling anything. Oh, well, of course you aren't. Then what's that in your paw? Here. Take these. No matter what happens, these shells must go to "manahateen." Much depends on it. Well, my nephew monty will certainly love them. All right, then, to Manhattan they go. [Laughing] What you got in your net, eddi? Looks like a lot of mud to me. [Laughter] Very funny. You want to see? Come on, watch the fur, will you? Watch the fur. Help me. Oh, brother. Would you look at what the cat won't drag in? Mad-rat the not-so-magnificent. And he's alone as usual. [Laughter] You scraggly runt. You're thinking of the perfectly charming sewer smell-- mad-rat the feather-collector. Ha ha ha. Leave me alone. [Laughter] Yeah, go on, you featherweight. Go on. Get lost, mad-rat. Yeah. Oh, rats. [Laughter] [Thunder] Taxi, oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! To the harbor, please. Ok, ma'am. Fasten your rat tails. Whoo-hoo! Isabella! Oh, no! Whoa! Help me! Ohh! Cool landing. What next? One minute I'm grabbing a taxi at the movies, and the next, whoosh, I've lost my pals. Oh, no. Not that, too. You'll find 'em. Are you a wharf rat as well? Yeah. From the Hudson river. Where do you live? Wharf 62. [Whistles] Swank. I'll be happy to walk you home, if you want me to, that is. What's your name? Monty mad-rat, but everyone calls me mad-rat. What a funny name-- mad-rat. You're not really mad, are you? Hey, where are you going? Shortcut. Come on. Oh. Ok. Oh! Ohh! Whoa! Hold on to the stones. It's too slippery. Here. Here, grab my tail. Help! Help me, please! [Grunting] There. Ooh. Uhh. Ooh. Brrr. Are you ok? I'd be in big trouble if you hadn't saved me. Oh, there's nothing to it. What is this place? The park Avenue drains. And exactly how do we get out of here? We don't from here. Where, then? We've got to hoof it to the harbor. Won't take long. Famous last words. [Dialing] [Telephone rings] Pollution/evolution laboratories-- your one-stop shop for all your noxious, toxic--[Coughs] Needs! Professor plumpingham speaking. Plumpingham, I need that new anti-rat spray, and I need it yesterday, plumpingham. Ok, uh-huh. The old stuff's nearly gone, not that it does any good. Oh, yes, yes, of course, Mr. Dollart. I just finished the first batch of our improved rat-away xgs, and, well, I'm afraid we're waiting for the-- well, you should be afraid, because I don't wait for anyone. Uh-huh. You have 24 hours, plumpingham. 24 hours. And spare me the details, professor. No details. Just deliver the goods. Deliver the goods. Meet my schedule or meet the bottom of the Hudson. You choose which meeting to attend. [Hangs up] Hello, Hudson. Ha. [Dial tone] At least I have a choice, huh? Oh. What a life. [Sniffing] Mmm. [Sniffing] Gently, my boy. Those are the last 2 aloe ve-rat petals. Smells ready. The last of the antitoxin. At least we have this much left, but for how long, I don't know. We must find more healing petals. But at this rate-- [Sniffs] It won't last another day. It'll have to do until we can track down more aloe ve-rat plants. [Sniffs] Yeah, assuming there's any more to be found. What a horrible, smelly job. Yuck! You really are a stranger to these parts, aren't you? The pack rats keep the drains clean so that the water can flow. Are you a drain-cleaner like those pack rats? No, no. I am an artist. I never would have guessed. Aren't you scared down here? No. And you don't need to be, either. But I'm not. Just don't leave me, ok? I won't. Come on. This way. Careful. Watch your step. Here. This is what I wanted to show you. Wow! This is really cool. So you like it, huh? Oh, yeah. Is this all yours? Yeah, it's my hideaway. It's too noisy for me at home. I wish I had a secret place like this. So what do you do here? Nothing. Dream. Bet you could throw wild parties down here. I guess so, but I don't know who I'd ever invite. Watch out. It's real slippery here. Whoo! Made it. Whoa! See what I mean? Wait. Don't go in there! Why not? Because that's the, um, a dead end. Dead end? Oh, come on, tell me the truth. What's down there? Nothing for young ladies who come from the uptown canals. That's sewer 237. Ooh. Sewer 237. How scary. I thought there's nothing to be afraid of down here. Well, there isn't. [Deep voice] Alone. What's that? Wait. Alone. Shh. I don't want him to hear US. Life can be drier than a chewed-on catfish bone. That beast could have swallowed US whole. That's Jean-Paul, the canalligator. Once he opens his mouth, there's no stopping him. You know that monster? Sure. And if he starts yapping, he'll talk you to death. Otherwise, he's a good gator. We'll have to jump up. Well, here we are. Where? At the end of our walk. But I don't see an exit. Listen. Dollart: It's 100%. I'll be real glad to get out of here. It's a done deal. It'll all be torn down-- the wharf, the warehouse, all of it. I'm talkin' 200,000 limos. 18 floors of mega-underground parking. Son, it's big! Sure as my motto is "the future is dollart." Ok. Bye, y'all. Bye. [Engine starts] [Coughing] [Coughing] See? There's your wharf 62. You mean, we came all the way home under the city? Wait till I tell my friend Allie. Bye. Monty. I'm sorry. Oh? [Kisses] Sorry for what? Because of me, you lost all your feathers. Feathers. Oh, who needs feathers to fly? Here I am on cloud 9 without the help of feathers. [Laughing] [Sighs] Great gorgonzola... Uh-oh. Ladida! Do you smell what I smell? [Sniffs] I suppose it must be canal number 5. [Laughs] Intercom: Guiseppe, have you seen my daughter? Ah, si, si, signor presidente. Your daughter, she's just entered the wharf. Uh, si, si,excellency. She's home. Aha! Yeah! You're welcome. [Music playing] Aah! This box! Is a piece of junk! Hey, you, hey! Uno minuto! Who me? Yes, you. Now, just where do you think you're going? I'm going to, uh... Hey, hey, speak up, huh? I'm a dormouse, not a mind reader, huh? The girl who just ran in here with a yellow silk ribbon... I don't know her name. Ooh-la-la, is that right? Now, what makes you think, ragazzo, I'm gonna tell you who does and who does not go in and out of here? [Box squeaking] Listen, no name, no amore, paisan. So sorry. Ay! This machine! Oh, brother! I'm gonna top you like cheese pizza! It's appalling, Isabella. How often have I warned you to wrap your tail onto a taxi's bumper? And through the gutters with a total stranger! Oh, it's unthinkable. And where's your umbrella? Gone with the wind. [Laughs] Oh, my. Hey, Izzy, what'd he look like? Do you have any idea how much that umbrella cost? Dear, oh, dear. I bet your sewer rat stole it. Sewer rats. You're starting to look like one yourself. How undignified. How dreadful! But, mama, he's from the Hudson river, too. No Hudson river rat worth their fur spends any time in those drains. Really, Isabella. Isabella! What did he look like? Mm, kind of cute, but a little quirky. And he saved me from drowning. What?! Where?! Oh. I don't believe it. Isabella, you're going to put me in an early grave. Drowning, you say? But, mama... No, no, no. This simply won't do. Into the tub with you, Isabella. All right, mother. And scrub behind your ears. [Giggles] Ohh! [Laughs] [Laughter] Well, if it ain't rat-olph Valentino. Mad-rat driving all the girls crazy with his studly charm. Not these guys again. Don't let me catch you, mad-rat, lover boy. [Laughter] Hey. Hey, boss. Yeah, what? Uhh! Watch out. [Laughter] [Ship's horn blows] [Telephone rings] [Ring] Dollart: Yeah? Plumpingham. Yeah. Listen, plumpingham, let me take care of that. You just hold up your end of the bargain, huh? I'll tell you what's wrong with rats. Besides cockroaches, they're the most repulsive creatures on earth. On top of that, they're in the way of progress. That's what. You know, progress. Hi. Progress! Progress! The thing I'm obviously not making with you! [Pounds desk] Rats are very smart, Lou. They always find a way. Do I look like I have cheese for brains? I've got rat-away xgs on my side. Those rats are as good as gone. Sweetheart, tell me. Does your precious sewer rat have a name? Is it anyone we know? It's monty. Monty mad-rat. [Gasps] But he seems quite sane. Isabella, have you forgotten you're a noble rat? Mama, I liked him very much. Really. He's a nobody, less than a nobody. Certainly no acquaintance... [Nibbles] For the president's daughter. The mad-rats are from the other side of the drain. The mad-rats aren't altogether there. But, mama, that's unfair. You've never met him, so how can you say what he's like? Hmph. [Grunting] Oh, I got to finish this sand castle if it's the last thing I do. I am gonna finish this sand castle. [Grunting] I dig makin' sand castles. Dig! Uh, yeah. Mm. [Grunting] Hi, dad. What you working on? All-new batch of sand castle. Sand castle 107. It's exactly the same as 87. Now, 106, well, it was a little off, but certainly better than number 76, but 24--oh, my dream castle. 24 was perfection. Perfection. Wonderful, dad. Really. Uhh. Want to join me? Maybe later, dad! Mommy, when are we gonna eat? Daddy says we're hangin' by threads. And we like hanging by threads. I'm hungry! Where's my food? I miss monty. Yes, I miss your brother, too, but he has things to do. When will I have things to do like monty? When you're old enough. Not fair. Wait. Oh, wait. Could he maybe have gone down to the dock to meet aunt Charlotte? [Children laughing] Hey! Aunt Charlotte! Over here! Monty, I knew you'd be here to meet me. Here I come. Ah. Mm. How long has it been since I last saw you? Was it before rio? Or was it when I came back from Jamaica? Oh, monty, being a ship's rat is the best thing in the world. You ought to consider taking a trip with your girlfriend. Girlfriend? But I don't have a girlfriend. Come, now. Your aunt Charlotte knows many, many things, and I can tell that you are smitten. Well, i-- you're right as usual. Aw, monty, every time I see you, I think of your uncle monty, my monty. Pity he's still lost in his own little world. He never liked to travel because he could fly so much higher and faster by using his own imagination. Me, I have the heart of a ship's rat. I like to travel, and as kipling said, "never the twain shall meet." So that's why you're not together? Because you wanted to travel and he didn't? It was a long time ago, and I don't believe in living in the past. That's just the way it goes sometimes. Oh, but did you know he made this silver ring for me? Wow. It's beautiful. Those yellow ribbons remind me of... You really like this girl, don't you? I guess I do. Then give her time. She'll come round. Look, monty, I brought a present for you-- these shells from an Indian shaman I met at an aztec ruins. I thought you might like to paint on them. Cool. Thanks. I had a feeling from the shaman that they're special, important somehow. I'm sure they're wonderful. Well, I hope you enjoy them, hon. I'll start painting them later tonight. Bye. Bye-bye. Monty, is that you? Oh, uh, hi. Come on, lad, don't be shy. The grand rat chat needs decisive young rats. Leave him alone, Walter. You do want to come to the meeting, don't you, my boy? Well, I'm not so sure. You see? The grand rat chat is the backbone of our democ-rat-cy. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Well, all right. I guess so. [Crowd chattering] Here we are. [Gasps] What's the name of that girl with the yellow ribbon? That's Isabella noble-rat, our president's daughter. And far too good for you my boy, so forget about her. On her left is her father, president Hugo noble-rat. And his advisors Jerry mumble-rat, finance minister stingy-rat, and crisis minister Carl ladida. My friends, the government is now prepared to deal with the toxic scourge that threatens all our lives. Let me say it loud and clear. We must stand together. Are you with me? [Crowd chattering] He says the same rubbish every speech. [Sniffing] It's that stuck-up ladida. Coming through. Mm. Step aside. My, my, laurat ladida. My dear rats, you've elected me, and that's why I'm here, to tell you what we-- you must do. Hello, Isabella. [Kissing] [Laughs] Laurat. To explain how we're planning to attack the foul scourge, I now give you our crisis minister, Carl ladida. Toxins already everywhere! Quiet! Ahem. We're investigating isolated cases of contamination along the wharf. We're establishing a crisis commission. Trust me. Everything's under control. Nothing's under control! [Crowd yelling] Come on, rudi. I got something to say. We'll be recommending precautionary measures, setting new boundaries. They're all idiots. Hey, let's raid garbage cans. We're all gonna die! Come on, get out of my way. Listen, rats. Who owns the wharf? The human named dollart, and he wants to wipe out every one of you wharf rats. His men are spraying a chemical called rat-away xgs into every rat hole. Your homes will be destroyed to make way for a parking lot. He's lyin'! You rats don't stand a chance. That's monty mad-rat! You're both drunk! He certainly ain't no wharf rat. Listen, there's only one way to stop dollart in his tracks. How do you know? Money! It's all about money, you helpless fools. Money's the only language those foul humans understand. You want to get rid of dollart, buy him out, pay him cash. Ain't that rudi rake-rat? He does business with humans! Rudi rake-rat escaped from a laboratory! Push that old mad-rat out of here! When somebody finally tells the truth, no one listens. These wharf rats are boneheads. Let's go, rudi. Rudi rake-rat! [Crowd shouting] That shrimp's called monty mad-rat, too. [Gasps] Monty? I've heard enough. I'm out of here. Mad-rat? My dear friends, here's what I propose. We'll set up a rescue committee. I hereby found rat rescue, r.R. For short. We--uh, you rats of Manhattan must collect money. Our goal--$100,000. Now look who's a mad-rat. Let him talk! With the money, we'll buy back the wharves from the human. It's the only way. That's how the world works, my friends. The most important thing for US to do is scrounge for as much money as possible. Our drain-cleaning activities must stop immediately. President noble-rat's right! Bravo! Bravo! Let's do it! It's money down the drains! Noble-rat, a word of caution. We need our pack rats down in the sewers. It's absolutely critical to our survival. Our lives depend upon the water not rising so it won't wipe out our homes. And let's not forget about our search for the healing aloe ve-rat. That must wait for now, doc. One problem at a time. I hereby declare the grand rat chat closed. Crowd: Money, money, money. We got to find some cash. Searching every gutter 'cause we got to find it fast. We'll stop the human dollart before he does US in. We'll buy him with our money. We'll pay him off at last. We'll bribe that greedy human, get rid of him with cash. We'll cover him with money. We'll buy him off with cash. We'll bribe that greedy dollart. We'll all be free at last! [Sighs] Oh. [Tapping on pipe] "Stop all work immediately." In that case... Whoa! Stop all work? Yeah, we're supposed to stop work and collect money instead. Who'll keep the sewers clean? I don't know, but the president ordered it. What do you think they're up to? Sounds kind of important to me. Got to be for US to stop cleaning sewers. Hey! Are you crazy?! You let go of my tail?! ♪ The money's in the vault ♪ ♪ the money's in the vault, the money's in the vault ♪ ♪ the money's in the vault ♪ ♪ the money's in the vault, the money's in the vault ♪ ♪ the money's in the vault ♪ Hey. Watch out, pack-rat. Here comes some more cash. Oh. Man: Oh, sure, sure. Ohh! Aah! This coin-collecting's more dangerous than the poison. Excuse me. Can I get through this way? Yeah, sure. First hole on the left. But watch out for the bank's laser alarms. Uh, thanks. ♪ The money's in the vault, the money's in the vault ♪ ♪ the money's in the vault ♪ ♪ the money's in the vault, the money's in the vault ♪ Uh, oh, no. My uncle. [Gasps] Hey, now there's a way to make money. We could just Rob banks. Yeah, brilliant idea. Not so brilliant, rudi. Stealing is wrong. Robber: Shoo! My boy, you look lost. Say, don't I know you from somewhere? Uh, no. You must be mistaken. I don't know you at all. Uh, excuse me. I've got to go. Oh, all right. Like I said, just another worthless wharf wacko. Sure looks like someone. [Snoring] [Sighs] That was a drop in the bucket, plumpingham. We need barrels, not bottles. I thought you knew by now that I don't do things halfway. Step aside there, rat. I'm in a hurry. Ah, si! Yes, of course! Oh, what a maraviglioso pleasure it is to see you again, signor laurat. I'm always at your service. Guiseppe. I assume the president is in his office, hmm? Oh, for you, of course. Oh, not you again, ragazzo. I--i--i want to see president noble-rat. Mama, you're a determined ragazzo, but the young lady is already spoken for. That was her fiancá right now. I have a donation for rat rescue. Ah, si. Well, in that case, go right in. [Feedback from box] Aah! Ohh! Oh, this noise is gonna drive me straight up the wall! Stop your squawking! Guiseppe, the white button. Mr. President, gentle rats, the humans are spraying everywhere, and we're nearly out of aloe ve-rat. You know, without more, we're all but sunk. Doc, money's what makes the world go round. We must fund rat rescue now. Uh, minister ladida is right. Ah, yes. Young rat. I hope you've got a contribution to rat rescue. Yes. And it's a very special donation. Special. Ha ha. Marvelous. Oh, gentlemen, see how this young fellow is willing to make a special donation to rat rescue. Oh, youth today. Extraordinary. Mr. President, you're an inspiration to US all. So, my young friend, how much have you collected? Daddy, laurat has a contribution for rat rescue. My soon-to-be son-in-law. [Laughs] So good to see you, yes. Well, laurat, how much is it? It is my great honor to contribute 25 cents to rat rescue. I need change for my dollar, if you please. 25 cents! My dear laurat, your generosity is a shining example to US all. And you may add your contribution to it, too. I didn't realize that so much money has already been collected. But here's my part anyway. [Laurat laughing] Are those shells? Ohh! That is courage! Preposterous! Absolutely absurd. [Laughing] Shells. [Coughs] What kind of a joke is this? [Laughing] Ridiculous. Baubles are no contribution at all. He's completely mad. But--but-- come, Isabella. [Sighs] Laurat, your tail has turned green. The toxin's all over you. What?! Oh! Ohh! Oh, somebody, help me! Allie, don't just stand there! Go fetch the doctor! He's right next door. What's your name? Montague mad-rat... Sir. Monty. I--i just thought-- no! No! No! That rat there is mad, I tell you! You're not welcome here! Ohh! No! What is it? What's wrong now? It's the toxin scourge! He looks so sick. This is the last of the antidote. Laurat is lucky. He'll get better, by hippo-rat. But now we're all in jeopardy. It's a catastrophe. Without the aloe ve-rat, I don't know what we'll do. Let's search for it. No one's available. How can that be? They're looking for money. Oh, yuck! Dad, what are you doing? I'm getting rid of that mad-rat's useless junk. But you can't do that. Can and will. Have you forgotten that I am the president? No, daddy. I shall do exactly-- they're truly beautiful. Isabella! I have work to do. I don't have time for this. The others will be here any minute, and I want to be-- oh, the others? They don't like monty, either. What you're doing is wrong. Those shells belong to monty. And besides-- Isabella noble-rat! I'll not be spoken to that way. Now throw that trash into the hole. No, I won't! I can't! Young lady, I will not have you defend a sewer rat while showing such disrespect to me. Why, I've never-- hey, daddy, isn't there money missing from your collection? Where? That can't be right. Why, I just counted it myself. Show me where it's missing. [Laughing] Well, there's nothing missing. It's all-- Isabella! Where did you go? Where? I am not afraid of the sewer. I like it down here. Really, I do. I do li--i do, I do. Doesn't bother me one bit. No way. I'm all right. Oh, my. I'll be fine. I will be fine. And I'll do just fine. Which way? [Roar] [Squeaking] Aah! Jean-Paul thought all you rats had left for high ground, no? You're trembling. Are you cold? Please don't hurt me, Mr. Gator. The only thing being hurt here is Jean-Paul's feelings. I mean you no harm. In fact, I rather enjoy company. I'm so lonely. Ok. I'm on my way to find old monty mad-rat. You know, the one who deals with humans. Ah, oui, monty the elder from under the museum of modern art. You come a strange way, no? Lucky for you you're only half lost, but unlucky for you, there's absolutely no earthly way back from sewer 237. So this-- this is sewer 237? It's horrible. Sewer 237 is the final resting place for rejected pets. Do you see? So let me guess. Next you're gonna tell me you're a pet. Mais oui. But a long time ago, when Jean-Paul was just a tiny gator, my owner flushed me down the drain. Kaboosh! As we used to say in Louisiana, that's life in the swamp. But it's not too bad living down here. I don't mind, but I don't get cable, and the reception, she's not so good underground. You're awfully lively for someone living in a graveyard. You are very perceptive, ma chererat. Come. Let's have a little gabfest. We certainly could talk about my tail. It's getting whiter and whiter by the year. Then get out into the sun. Mm-mm. Jean-Paul does not care for the sun. Jean-Paul likes the cool of the canal. [Humming] Jean-Paul, where are you going? Jean-Paul! Jean-Paul, look, I'm in a major hurry. Which way is the museum? Why are rats always in such a big rush? Scurrying about like they're on hot coals. Life is too short. Come along, ma chererat. We'll have our little chat along the way. [Sighs] Oh, Isabella. Notice anything? Yes. That you never stop talking. The water's rising. It's raining outside. Exactement. Yet the canal, it should not flood in the rain. Mmm, mmm, no. Jean-Paul! Not if you rats were keeping the drains clear instead of gathering money. Jean-Paul, when you dawdle like that, I can't carry on with the conversation. Mon dieu.I'll be quiet as a mouse. So, let me see, 5 rings at $100 a pop, is 500 bucks. Divided by 2, um... Oh, that makes 400 big ones for me, and the other half for you. Oh, rudi, those humans have really dulled your thinking with all their experiments. Ratwash! I've been clinically tested. My thinking is clear as cotton, which is more than you can say. [Chuckles] I'll never make a decent rat out of you again. I'd prefer a decent payday. Money talks, you know. Left? Right? Straight ahead? Up or down? Which way? Ma chererat, there is no one right way. Wherever you are is where you should be, no? This then must be the right place. What? [Faint noises] This is it? Hey, what's that noise? Old monty and rudi. You were in a hurry to find them. Yes, I am, but which pipe do I take? He who seeks finds. Or as we say down in the bayou-- Jean-Paul, please! You trust Jean-Paul? Yes! Just tell me which way to go! This way or that. No matter which way you choose, you'll always be taking the correct pipe. Knock it off! There are no shortcuts. You're so excitable. You're driving me nuts! Aw, you're no fun. No fun at all. Take the broken pipe. Or as we say in Louisiana-- see you later, canalligator. Chase after good fortune, but don't go too fast now, you hear? The word on the street is bad. More spraying by the hour. Serves 'em right, all those harbor snobs. Mmm! Mr. Mad-rat, you've got to help US! Look, I've got something for you. Ah, the president's daughter. So you've all come to your senses, have you? Care for a drink? No, thanks. My father has no idea I'm here. But I've got the perfect idea for rat rescue. And why should we help you with it? Because you're the only ones who can. We desperately need money. Well, aren't we special? Lucky US. You're looking for our money? You've come to the wrong address, lady. We're artists. Dollart's trucks are spraying every rat hole. My fiancá is fatally ill. We'll all die! If you want heroes, try the next gutter over. What can we do about it? I heard you had contact with humans. Humans that buy art. Subway! Oh! [Coughing] This is weird down here. [Coughing] Weird only by your standards. To US, it's home. Yes, we're friendly with one human. The gallery owner, Mrs. Jellybelly, gives US pins, and I decorate them. Is it so wrong to make friends of enemies? What have you got for US in there? Hey! Keep your grubby paws off! Mad-rat: Rudi! Here. This shell was painted by a young rat from the Hudson. He could be related to you. He's also called mad-rat. Ah, my nephew monty. Do you remember, rudi? The wharf rat in the bank vault. This painting is excellent, but I'm curious. Where did he get this shell? Are you kidding me? You're not taking that trinket upstairs? This is art! Besides, we can't go to the gallery today. Anyway, it's waytoo dangerous. But we have to raise the money! All our lives depend on it! You got any more of these? 2 more. Well, miss bauble-rat-- that's noble-rat! Leave them here and I'll-- we'll take them to the gallery on Monday. But you'll be lucky to get 10 cents for them. Monday?! We'll be cooked by Monday! We'll be cooked today if we do what miss trouble-rat asks for! We rats must stick together. Yeah. Right. Don't forget that. The human jellybelly is only alone in her gallery on mondays. Today there will be others. It's a terribly big risk. It's the ultimate risk! If you're too afraid to go, I'll go alone, and I'm a noble-rat! Listen, miss double-trouble rat, I'll sell your souvenirs, but we'll be lucky not to end up in some cat's Swiss cheese sandwich. Souvenirs?! Why, you shaggy weasel of a lab rat! I'm not that stupid. You're just after my money! And you're nothing but a puffed-up wharf rat Princess! Keep your precious sea food Picasso trash! Incoming! Oh! What have you done? Wow! Yeah! Well, now I'm impressed. These shells may be worth something after all. So it's well worth the risk? Yes. Now, let's not waste any more time. [Footsteps] Well, hello there, monty. I'm so glad I managed to bump into you again before my ship leaves. I'm troubled, aunt Charlotte. Sounds to me like you're having your share of girlfriend problems, hmm? You don't know the half of it. Look, monty, it's not the end of the world. My life is going nowhere. My dad builds sand castles all day, my mom makes feather hats, the humans want to poison US, and, truthfully, Isabella's not really my girlfriend. But your heart's in the right place. Just take matters into your own paws. We missed our chance, your uncle and me. We were both too young and impatient. Look, listen to me. If you can't think of what to say to Isabella, then here, take my ring and let it do all the talking for you. Aunt Charlotte... I don't know if I can do that. Of course you can. You're the best. [Squeaking] You expect me to get onto that thing? You gonna chicken out now, huh? I don't know. Nothing to it. All right. Whoa! Help! Help! Help, please! Hang on! I got your hand! I'm slipping! Oh, no, the shell! Mad-rat: You can do it. Don't let go! Come on! Oh! Oh! Thanks. I must have more lives than a cat. That's just wonderful. Now we can kiss a third of our profits good-bye! Hello? Is anyone home? Hello, Jean-Paul? Are you there? Isabella's ribbon? [Gasps] Isabella! Isabella, where are you? You ok, ma'am? Yes. Are you the gallerist? Yes. But we're busy. Come back. Later. Oh! Never again! Mmm! Oh! Sorry, ma'am. No, no, no. Don't hang the new clearwater until tomorrow. All right, boys? Got it, ma'am. Turn around. Mmm! Excuse me, ma'am. Oh! What's that? I told you this was the wrong day. It's the next hole down. Quietly, rudi. [Ding] So, when can we talk to this jellybelly? Let's check it out. [Meow] [Meow] [Meow] Camouflage is everything. If I wasn't such a good rat, I'd make a pretty good cat, eh? Ok, jellybelly's alone. Then let the negotiations begin. Let me see. [Ding] Oh, my word! You rang, miss jellybelly. You need anything? Uh, no, Nick. I'll be there in a minute. Tom: In a minute? I have things to do, Tom. Let's see if she takes the bait. Uh-oh, that's not good. Oh, dear. Now what do we do? I'll try again. Guys... This is pathetic. What are you rats up to? I can't sell this. This is unsellable. But, now, what about a nice rat-tail silver pin? Are these real? Let's talk. New yorkers love these things. It shows...Rattitude. But this? Guys, you know better than this. And listen, only come on mondays when the gallery's closed. I told you. It's too dangerous. [Seashell clatters] Holy moly. [Laughs] Neo...post-virtual realism! So, my fine furry friends, how's this? What? Even if she ponies up 40 grand, I'm still gonna play hardball. Are you out of your mind? 40,000! My fiancá laurat-- hold your tail, sister. I'm conducting heavy-duty negotiations. One thing rudi does well is negotiate. Are you nuts? This is 20,000 of the easy greasy! You really are wacko! Maybe. But there's a method to my wacko-ness. I have to hear the tumblers on her vault click into place first. A pair. Hmm. [Clicking] [Chuckles] Get it now, miss yodel-rat? Maybe rudi has a clue what he's doing after all, eh? Oh! Ohh... [Sniffs] No need to count it. It smells like 150 grand. $150,000?! You can thank me later. Right now I say we gotta high-tail it outta here. Ok! It'll be like taking candy from rodents. And no one will ever know the difference. Oh, back up! We're going to have to make a run for it. We're only going to get one shot at this. When I distract them, you dash for the hole back to the cellar. Go! What about you? Aah! There's one! Get him! Get him! Jelly! One for belly! Come over here, Tom! Aah! Come here, you! Yaah! Aah! He's too fast! He's getting away! I'll get you little suckers! Can't breathe. [Coughing] Aaah! Yeah! So-- stop! Stop! This ought to put a chill in his ratty plans. [Air conditioner hissing] [Shivering] Ohh, I'm so cold. That mad-rat's a fool. Sacrificing himself like that. Mad-rat, but dead-rat. No good's gonna come of it. Especially now that that little Princess has all the money! Hey, what Princess would that be? What's it to you, rat? You said the name mad-rat. If you're talking about monty mad-rat, that's me. Ah, the late, great mad-rat's relative has arrived at last. A little too late to help old monty. He's a goner. One for sewer 237. And because of you, by the way. And get this straight. There's nothing left to inherit. A goner? Where? What happened? And why because of me? He ran decoy at the museum so's me and that noble-rat's daughter could escape. Who would have guessed your uncle would do something so--so brave? The fool. Listen, kid, I gotta tell you. No rat has ever escaped the air conditioner, and now you know what I had to go through. Say, you got any cash? How do I get to this gallery of yours? Hey, one question at a time. What? Do you have any cash for the r.R. Project? You know, rescue rudi. I don't have time for your games. Spit it out! How do I get to the art gallery? Gee whiz, can't take a joke. Take pipe 44, bear left at the first elbow, then at the second junction jump 3 times. Then dead ahead. Got it? Yeah. Got it. [Grunting] Can you see anything? No, nothing. Just dust! Oh, Mrs. Jellybelly. Ohh. We'll fix it later. Sure you will. You can't fool me. I know what you're doing. Well, we're after one of these horrible rats. Yeah. And my wonderful money. My 3-iron? Yeah. Look what you've done. I've had it with you. You're fired! Both of you! Get out! You're the real rats! Get out! Get! Wait! We--stop! Mrs. Jellybelly--oof! You're out of the art world! Nick: That was your idea! Tom: Was not! Uncle monty, what have I done? Extraordinary craftsmanship. Enchanting. Almost mystical. Yes, there is something magical about them. I can't quite put my finger on it. A certain depth to the artistry, you know? Mmm, I agree, jellybelly. Evelyn, please. Evelyn, I love it. Pre-hysteric. They'll make the ideal present for Lou. You haven't seen anything yet, my dear. Watch while I break one. Oh, no, no, no. Don't you dare. I'll take them exactly as is. Now... How much do you want? I've been thinking. I don't really... You know, my research indicates they're... Extraordinarily valuable. The Mayans believed these shells to be the keys to a lost city. Oh, that does make them valuable. Mm-hmm. My shells are the keys to a lost city? How much? 300. Fine. $300. [Chuckles] $300,000. Eww! Plus tax. That's--that's quite a lot. For some people. Hmm...but... It's only money. Exactly. Fine. $300,000 it is. And, Evelyn, I'll take that sculpture for myself. As an investment. Wise decision. And that... Oh, my god, there's a rat! Aah! Ludwig! Ludwig, attack! No! Attack! That's one of my artists! Is he established? [Panting] [Banging] Uncle? Uncle! Uncle monty, wake up! Oh, no, you're so cold. [Grunting] Ohh... Mmm. [Sniffing] Ugh! Ew! Ew! All the perfume in fumingdale's couldn't make me smell any better now. Ugh. Come on, uncle monty. Stay with me. Hey, anyone down here? Monty, my friend! Must you startle people like that? It's my nature, eh? Things have been so strange lately. I've been up to my neck in water for far too long. And now Jean-Paul is lonelier than ever, but I'm so glad to see you again. What brings you here, mon ami? Jean-Paul, I need your help. My uncle, he's dying. Oh, I see. So you want a ride to sewer 237. No! Into the sun. Quickly! To central park! To the sun? You gonna go up there as well? Jean-Paul, please. Now! Ok. Now, don't you get your tail in a twist. Just hold on to your uncle. Now...hold on! [Inhales deeply] This bank will do fine, Jean-Paul. [Muttering] There's too much junk in my mouth. Hey! That's one of my shells. Where did you get that? Jean-Paul can't keep track of what gets stuck in his teeth. Right now, the sewers are full of strange but tasty stuff. Uncle. Uncle monty. Jean-Paul's in central park. Amazing, no? Ohh. Isabella, where have you been? We're saved! We've been worried about you. See? I've got money. Lots of money. Money? Money?! Izzy, look around you. The r.R. Project has ruined US. Because the drains are backed up, are homes are almost underwater. Then all this running around was for nothing? No. We're sending every rat back into the sewers to get the water flowing again. Where did you get all that money? Hmm. On the megatrip of a lifetime. It was amazing. I traded monty mad-rat's shells to a human for it. And we almost didn't escape. Oh, Isabella, endangering yourself like that. Uh, you'd best stop in and see laurat. Uh, wait a minute. Did you say mad-rat? Isabella, wait! That mad-rat is, well... Well, mad! Who let this disgusting sewer rat in here? Go on, get out! Climb back into the gutter you came from! But, laurat, it's me... Isabella. Isabella? Mm-hmm. My Bella does not go into the sewers. If she does... If she does, what then? She'll never become a ladida. [Mumbles] I'm proud I've been in the sewers. No amount of sewer muck could disgust me as much as you do right now! It's over between US, laurat ladida. You aren't even half the rat monty is. Mmm. Huh? Come on, sun. Shine. [Groans] Where--where am I? This can't be heaven, can it? Once you warm up, you'll feel better, uncle monty. Monty? You're also named monty, aren't you? You're George mad-rat's son. Uh-huh. Then why were you so ashamed of your uncle the other day? Ooh. Oh, I'm so cold. Ooh. Uncle... Can you forgive me? It's just that you... That I... All the other rats, they seem to make fun of you, and... And they make fun of you, too. And you think that's my fault? Most rats are just like humans. Some good. Some bad. Most just hope to make the best of life. [Coughing] But we need the humans to survive. True. As much as they need US. As much as all the creatures on earth need each other. But we rats must learn to think and act for ourselves, not just be pushed around. That's why the others don't like me. I don't just go with the flow like they do. Uncle. Yes, my boy? I'm really sorry about acting like I didn't know you. I had just come from the grand rat chat, and, well, I guess I was just too much of a coward. You're no coward. You were very brave. You saved me from that air conditioner. Now, tell me, where did you get those shells? From aunt Charlotte. She told me she got them from an old Indian near some aztec ruins down in Mexico. Ah, Charlotte-- still on the go. [Chuckles] Oh, what an old fool I've been. That business at the gallery was a bad idea. But nowi know what's behind all this. I should have realized those shells have powerful energy. You see, monty, the shells are magical. They should never have come to Manhattan. No, they should have gone to manahateen. Where? What's manahateen? Legend has it that manahateen is a mystical place where all things coexist in true peace and Harmony. Healing plants... Like aloe ve-rat... Grow easily in its rich soil. All of nature, the creatures, plants, and the earth grow together in manahateen. It's that way for US, too. Nature has made it so we must depend upon one another to survive. You see, the manahateen philosophy is simple. He who accepts nature is accepted by nature. [Coughs] But, uh, what can I do about it? Monty, each life is as important as the rest. Each and every life is precious and valuable. You must help to protect and preserve life. [Coughing] I haven't much time left. [Coughing] But you, monty, you must carry on. [Wheezing] Now listen carefully to me. The human with the silver car. Uh, the one who wants to destroy US all? Yes. Dollart. He must see the error of his ways. [Breathing erratically] Hang on, uncle monty. You'll be fine. Mad-rat, you made it out. Oh. Oh, uh, i--I'm sorry. I'm glad we had this chance to talk. Come on, uncle monty. Please don't leave US. Rudi... My friend. This is horrible. No. No. No, this, too, it part of life. Farewell, my friends. Uncle monty. [Sobbing] Kid, we still need one more twig. Aha. There! That's plenty, kid. You know, your uncle thought you had real artistic talent, and to tell the truth, I've seen the work you did on those shells. It's great. Thanks, rudi. I guess I'll be on my way then. Wait, wait. Where are you going? To find Isabella. Aw, there's as many girl rats out there as there are sewer pipes. What do you say the 2 of US go into business together? Lou. Found a little something for your office. Oh? They're the latest thing. Prehysteric. That's nice, dear. Yeah, right. Thanks for the, uh... Shells. Yeah. The water isn't receding. I have to check on stressvac's progress. But, Lou, we'll be late for the opera. Yeah, whatever. Can you just get my bow tie from upstairs while I check this out, huh, dear? I'll meet up with you in a minute. Ohh, that man. Work, work, work. Isabella. I've been looking high and low for you. Monty. I was hoping you'd come. I have bad news. My uncle... He didn't make it. Oh, no. He was so brave. He saved US at the gallery. A real sacrifice. Oh, monty, I'm so sorry. I'm going to carry out his final wish. Come with me to see dollart. Look, I've got one of my shells back. We still have a chance to rescue everyone. Now you're talking. I'm in. Isabella. Yes, monty? I, uh... This ring is for you. Ohh, monty, it's gorgeous. [Smooching] Well, at least that wall's up. Now, if we can only get rid of all those rats. Dollart's poison truck. All right. Ok. Aah! [Coughing] Ohh. Ah. Look. The biggest snake of all undone by his own spray. [Groans] Monty, break your shell, too. What? Just trust me. You'll see. It's important. Ok. Wow! Oh, Isabella! That's amazing. Uncle monty wasright. The shells... They are magical! [Groans] How can we use them to find more of the aloe ve-rat? Let's ask Jean-Paul. Jean-Paul! Finally, there's some action down here. Why do you always leave Jean-Paul alone for so long? Talking to myself gets so boring. Hi, Jean-Paul. We have to hurry! Hello, cherat. Now he's in a hurry, too. Petit,your impatience must be contagious. Have no fear, Jean-Paul is here. Hop on, mes amis. Jump. Whoo! Jean-Paul, have you ever heard of manahateen? I wouldn't be much of a canalligator if I hadn't. So why didn't you tell me? Jean-Paul wasn't asked, so Jean-Paul never answered. Simple, huh? Here we go. Hang on! This'll be fun. Come on, Jean-Paul. We've gotta go. So many places to go. Rats to see, sewers to save. Do you really know where you're going, or are you aimlessly wandering around? Jean-Paul, do you know the way or not? How can I wander aimlessly when I'm always where I'm supposed to be? Do canalligators know when to stop talking? I heard that! Monty, I think we must be getting close. "End... "Ma... "Mana... Hateen." At least the signposts have been kept up-to-date. Jean-Paul. Yes? How soon? We'll never get there at this rate. Monty: Look, up on the wall. Our shells form the same patterns as those imprints. [Isabella gasps] Ohh. Wow! Manahateen! Isabella: Truly beautiful. But I don't see any aloe ve-rat plants anywhere. The flood level is still too high. Look! Below the water! There's enough aloe ve-rat down there to last US a hundred years, but how will we get it up from the bottom? [Takes deep breath] You know, I think there must be a better way than that, Jean-Paul. Jean-Paul: Ah, the water, it speaks. Isabella: Aloe ve-rat! Look at how much there is! [Monty gasps] We are gonna make it, just like uncle monty said. "He who accepts nature is accepted by nature." I know what you're thinking. Both: We must save dollart. Ah, even Jean-Paul wants to move in a hurry now. Shake a tail, huh? I just hope we're not too late. Oh, no. Oh, it doesn't look good. He's so pale. Look at the spots on his face. [Sniff sniff] Ohh. Ohh. Look out! Hey. Let go. You darn rat. I mean you... Wonderful darn rat. Let him be! It's ok. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm alive. You just saved my life. I don't know how or why, but you did. I could kiss you. Yecch. Ugh. Oh. Human germs. Yecch. [Laughing] Who would have figured I'd be saved by rats? I'm eternally grateful to you. I've changed my mind about you rats. Maybe you're not so bad after all, and maybe, just maybe, when I'm through, you'll think i'm not so bad either. Look... After what you just did for me, I can't destroy your homes. I'm canceling my project. Thank you. Thank you, my friends. From the bottom of my heart. Thank you every so much. Well, how do you like that? Where'd that funny tree come from? Lou, this is incredible. What a fantastic sculpture. Ooh. And it's the only thing to ever be constructed on this site. I don't understand. What? I'm dedicating the rest of the property as a safe haven. A refuge for wild animals. Any and all animals are welcome here. Ohh. Lou... I'm proud of you. Hey, monty, we just heard the news. We always figured you were one of US. Ha ha. Right, guys? Yeah, sure I am. Hey, what's the deal with the pooch, huh? Go on, beat it, you scraggly mutt, eh? [Giggling] Oh, Isabella, uncle monty's probably up there somewhere, decorating pins. You really loved him, didn't you? Yeah. Too bad I didn't get to know him better. Monty, you want to stay here a while? Just the two of US? Yeah. Maybe until just a few minutes before forever. Ah, the 2 loverats. Well, I don't know about you, but I sure learned my lesson. Money doesn't make the world go 'round. Love does. Love does. Love can bloom, even in the sewers of Manhattan. If only I'd learned this when I was younger, maybe I wouldn't have so much catching up to do. Now I know, love can cure whatever ails rats, and man, too, of course. Ha. Ahh, well. It's never too late to find love wherever it may grow. Ahh. Captioning made possible by Warner Bros. Captioning performed by the national captioning institute, inc.
