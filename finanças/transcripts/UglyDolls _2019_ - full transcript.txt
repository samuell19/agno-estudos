It's just... haven't you ever felt like, even if you're happy, which I definitely am... I mean, I just spent an entire day singing about it... there's still something else, there's something more you're supposed to be doing? Good night, Ox. Lucky Bat, see you tomorrow. Maybe it'll be the day. I just don't want to see her heart get broken when this impossible dream of hers doesn't come true. Maybe I could talk to her. Oh, please, Lucky, give it a try. We've run out of options here. She doesn't listen to me. I've done everything I can do. I'll give it a try.

Thanks for accepting my random yet urgent invitation. - How are things? - Well... Every day I think: "Today's the day." And then it isn't. And that's fine, it is, but... Look, I've always believed the Big World is real. I know I'll find the perfect kid for me. But lately I'm starting to wonder with no evidence, no proof, what if it's not true? Hmm. "Find your own truth... 6, 9, 25, 18, 36, 41." Whoa. This is why you're the wisest doll in town. You're so right. I have to believe in myself. Uh... sure. So how do I do that? Specifically? Uh, well, a wiser doll than me would say you should stop listening to what others tell you. But all I have to offer you now is some... Satisfaction Guaran-tea. Oh! You want to read my tea leaves! Of course! Um, you know, reading tea leaves is not... it's not really my thing. But I can tell you that your forehead looks nice and bright. And that's good luck. So take that good luck and believe in yourself from the comfort of your own home. What do you see? Uh... - You... - "You"? Oh! You mean me. It's not what you see, but what I see. Hmm... I see leaves. Leaves! I need to leave! All this time I've been waiting for my kid to find me, but I should find my kid! Wait, what? That's not what I was saying at all! Thank you so much, Lucky! You're so wise. So wise! - Well, I'm just lucky... - Come on! Moxy, I think you may have misinterpreted the spirit of what I was trying to... - Ugly Dog, let's go. - Yeah! I know that look. Wait up! Yes, let's wait up! Babo! Lucky Bat has a great new idea. - No, no... - We're gonna make our dreams come true! I'm always geared up for dreams. - Or nightmares! - Wage! Today's the day! But, Moxy! - Come on! - Here we go again. Can't we just hit pause real quick? Oh! Hello, Moxy. Looks like you're all having a good time. Oh, loads of fun. Lucky Bat made everything crystal clear. Hey, Lucky! Attabat! We're gonna make our dreams come true! Everything that comes to Uglyville arrives here. So if we're going to find the Big World, it's only logical we start here. Okay, the Big World and children do not exist. I just wanna have a look inside that flower. Who's with me? Don't do it. - I'm in! - Me, too! - Traitors. - Eh? Come on. Come on over here. Hit me. - Just a quick look. - And then we'll turn back. Yes! You guys are the ugliest. Now the only question is: how do we get up there? Hey! Whoa! Eh, I got nothing. Hmm. We need something that could grip onto the edge nice and tight. Even then, it would still need to hold all our weight. Huh? No, no. No. No! Anytime now, guys. Let's go. Hmm. Wow. Oh, good. A terrifying void. That's always a good sign. This is what the inside of a flower looks like? Yeah, dark and creepy. All right, that's it. Let's go. Anyone else going to UglyDolls On Ice tonight? Nah, I don't wanna miss this week's episode of Uglyville's Got No Talent. Moxy? Let's just call it a day, huh? You guys, this pipe goes somewhere. Say something to her. Um... Sometimes, the insides of our dreams are hollow. Like this pipe, for example. Hollow, huh? I guess a girl can dream. We'll just go on back like a bunch of go-on-backers. I just gotta see what it's like! I think we probably should have expected her to do that. - Here we go. - Moxy. Moxy! Slow down. You're gonna slip. It's dangerous! Almost there! Come on! Come on, guys! Come on! Um... I guess not. Guys. What if this is the way to the Big World? But Ox says there is no Big World and he... He didn't know there was something else out there. But we do. This pipe? It's real, and it has to lead somewhere. Maybe it's the Big World. If anyone can figure it out, it's us. Lucky, what could make you wiser than solving the ultimate unsolved mystery? Hello! Mystery ahead! And, Ugly Dog, you're my best friend. Well, that's just hurtful. Are you really going to let me go in alone? You ain't goin' alone. Classic guilt trip. And when someone needs help, who y'all gonna call? Babo, that's who! I gotta say, she gets me. Hmm. I suppose a little journey could be enlightening. This is ridiculous! Going into a creepy pipe that spells certain doom? No. No, thank you! Wage. Go ahead. Give me your big sell, Moxy. Tell me that I have to go. It's my duty as a doll to be a friend. Tell me that deep down I want to know what's over there, too. Come on. Give me the pitch! If you don't come, you're going to have to climb down that cliff all by yourself. Good pitch. Let's just let the record show that I am against this. Now, that's what I'm talking about, Wage. Slow down, Blobby. - It's Babo. - I know your name. There are so many tunnels. What we really need is a light. I have a flashlight! So why have we been walking in the dark for the last hour, then? I'm conserving the batteries until we really need it. Good thinking. Let me know when you come upon a time when you really need it. You got it! You smell anything? It's hard to say. It'd be easier if I had a nose. Creepy falling babies! Whoa! Creepy falling babies! Oh, no! Oh, no. Huh? Whoo! Yes! Hey, look at me go! Hello! I'm freakin' out. Breathe in deep. Very calmly! And exhale. Blehh! Blehh! Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

Obviously. Moxy. You know what? We're not going anywhere. What are you doing? Have you lost your mind? We don't belong here. We've come this far. Um... come again? We're gonna train and go to the Big World. We're just as lovable as any of you. And we're gonna prove you wrong. Before we decide to do this, shouldn't we tell Ox? Ox? Who is Ox? Well, he's the founder and mayor of our town, where we live. So there's a whole town of Uglies? It's called Uglyville. I guess they're into literal naming. None of this matters. Okay? Only Pretty Dolls can run the Gauntlet. Rules are rules. What rules? - Uh... - Did someone say "rules"? - It says right here in section 43... - Oh! You know what? Stay here. - Seriously? - Yes. What kind of amazingly benevolent leader would I be if I denied fellow dolls a chance to fulfill their dreams? Mandy, show our special guests their quarters. May I suggest the Supply Suite. Sweet! I have a reputation to maintain, so I let you skate by this time. Enjoy this moment. Because it doesn't get better than this. Ha! That's the name of our song. Find out everything you can about their town and report back to me tomorrow night. - Night? Like a date? - No. But there is one more thing I need you to do.

So you guys actually live in these boxes? Not that they're bad boxes. They're all neat and organized and straight... and symmetrical and clean and... Whew. I'm okay. Silly tree. Oh, my goodness. Okay. This way, please. What is that? That would be the supply she... I mean suite. Your home away from home. We are staying there? I love it! - Am I the only one seeing this? - It's so industrial chic. "Industrial chic"? It's a shed. I mean, there's boxes and a mop. Dibs on the mop and the bucket of dirty water. - Check out my spare tire. - It matches my other tire. - This place is perfect for us. - Hey, hey, guys. I'm really glad you like it and all. But I didn't get your names. - Sorry. I'm Moxy. - Babo. - Lucky Bat. - Wage. - Folks call me Ugly Dog. - Because that's his name. - But those close to me call me Slick Dog. - Which is not his name. Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. So are you really here just to train for the Big World? - Yup. - You bet! And we're all gonna end up with our own special kid to love. You do know that Lou is gonna make it super hard, right? Well, I say bring it on, Louis. He means well, of course. - Though he can be a bit judgmental. - Ya think? Still, without his constructive criticism, none of us would ever get anywhere. So just stay on his good side. Ow! Cool glasses. I always wanted some specs. - Ooh, yeah! I feel smarter already! - Excuse me! - No! - Do I look wiser? - Oh, yeah! - No! Please, just... Please! Huh? We're sorry. Please don't say anything, guys. Especially not to Lou. Lots of dolls wear glasses in Uglyville. Even Five-Eyed Steve. This is the Institute of Perfection, and Perfect Dolls have perfect eyesight. Oh! Man, and I thought I had issues. Do you feel that electricity between us? Watch this. She's gonna turn around. She's gonna turn around. She's doing the old "don't turn around" move. Well, she didn't need glasses to see through you. Whoa! Hey, Mandy! Sorry. I think your glasses look special. They make you who you are. Yeah, but... No butts about it! See you tomorrow! Ugh. Are you kidding me? First that dark, greasy pipe, and now we have to go down there? Yeah, maybe someone down there can tell us where Uglyville is. Lowering, lowering, lowering. Creeping, creeping, creeping. Sneaking, sneaking... It's not sneaking if you say it. Huh? Huh? Huh? Evenin'. Lookin' ugly. - Check me. Am I ugly? - Come on. Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling. Gross! Go, go, go! Come on, Willard. I got a lot of buttons riding on you. Come on! Do it for Five-Eyed Steve! This place is definitely ugly, that's for sure. Hey, Tuesday, jot that down. Yas! Lou's gonna be like, "You guys are the awesome-est spies ever." And then he'll love me. And the winner is Wedgehead, by a wedge. Thanks, Mayor Ox! Is that a bunny or something? Oh, I love bunnies. No, that's Ox! And there he goes. Let's move! Get him into the bag, up the pipe, and we're on our way back to Lou. - Easy-peasy. Any questions? - Yes! As a matter of fact. - Are those my earrings? - Yes. Any more questions? How could you take them without asking me? It was super easy. Oh, no, no. Don't cry, Lydia. It'll give you frown lines. Attagirl. It's no big deal, right? I mean, it's not like I borrowed your lip gloss. Wait, is that my lip gloss? Whoa, is that the time? Getting late. Let's do this. Synchronize! - That's my watch! - It is, but it looks better on me. Come on. - It does look good on her. - I know, right? Hmm... Whoa! Whoo! Got the Ugly rabbit thing. Ow! Oh, a little rabbit in the sack, huh? I'm a natural ear runner. You'll never catch me... Right in the buttons. Good thing for that random rake. Just like we planned it. Now tell us where Uglyville is! Today you begin your training. And I know that seems stressful, maybe a little scary. But remember: This is your purpose as a doll. And I would never let you fail. I've dedicated my entire life to making sure you go to the Big World. That's right. I'm doing this for you. And you. And you. - Me? - Yes, you! Wait, so that whole "You're ugly, you're trash" song, that was because you loved me? Of course I love you. I love all of you. And I will take you there! Ooh! Ah! I wanna hate him. I mean, I really wanna dislike this guy. But I gotta respect the man's fireworks budget. I'm so awesome. But I'm here to get you pretty. Because pretty makes perfect. And I don't know about you, but that sounds pretty great to me! ♪ So let's get started ♪ Do you want your clothes ruined by a tea party gone awry? Do you want to find yourself on the business end of a permanent marker? - No! - And you! - Huh? - Your kid spent an hour styling your hair. But then, disaster strikes. Who's gonna get the gum out? Who? I don't know! Today you're going to practice how to avoid stains, smudges, and spills. Or as I like to call them: "The S's of Messes." Thank you. I actually came up with that one myself... Sorry. Don't kids have fun getting messy? Wait. Was this part of the test? Yes, it was. And you passed! For real? Enjoy the Big World! Thank you so much! - I didn't think we'd ever make it. - I am wise. I'm gonna meet my child! Are you guys ready? What? This, students, is what happens to dolls who get messy. Whoa! They get put through the wash! Every time you go through the washer, you come out a little less perfect. And if you keep getting less and less perfect, one day even the washer won't save you and your child's parents will throw you away. I just don't want to see any of you get rejected. So if you want to pass these tests, avoid mess. Stay out of the wash. You guys, he's right. We've got to focus.

But just between us, no matter how agile or unshakable you may be, when you look up there at that perfectly pretty doll and all the joy she comes with, do you honestly think your little band of sock puppets stands a chance here? Okay. Carry on tryin', but like I always say... pretty makes perfect. Good luck at the Gauntlet tomorrow. Maybe Lou is right. If pretty is what he wants, we can do pretty. Moxy, what are you talking about? Kidnapping should be a crime. I'm pretty sure it is a crime. Good points on both sides. Maybe we should stop the kidnapping until we settle this. No way. He's expecting us. And I want him to see my bangs. They're side-swept now. He's not gonna care about your bangs! You guys are being haters lately. Let me out! Where am I? Who's in charge here? Huh? Hello, old friend. L-Lou? They know each other? He just said, "L-Lou?" Keep up. Lou, have you seen my bangs? I think it's an improvement. Hi! Ready for tomorrow? Oh, my doll. We...

I suspected as much. But maybe you'll believe him. Hello? We kidnapped him. Oh, yeah. Ox? I... I don't understand. - Moxy. - Ox. Wait. You won't believe this. The Big World is real! I know. What? Come on, Ox. Relieve the poor creatures of their confusion. Why don't you start at the beginning. What's he talking about? Moxy, all I wanted to do was protect you. But Lou's right. You're never gonna get to the Big World. Let me try to explain. It all began in the Doll Factory. I don't know how, but I ended up here at the Institute. Lou welcomed me and we became close friends. And after I begged and begged, he even let me train. I even felt like I might have a shot at the Big World. I was messing it up for the others, and they started to turn on me. I was scared. It was only Lou who saved me by showing me a way out. I wandered into the dark, and that's when I discovered the ugly truth about who we are and where we came from. We UglyDolls are nothing but rubbish. The humans found us unlovable and threw us away. I blocked the way to Recycling so that outcast dolls would be diverted to our cove. We are rejects. No! We belong in Uglyville where reject dolls can live safe and free of anyone else's judgment. Oh, Moxy, look at you. This is what I've been trying to protect you from. But I realized you'd need to hear it from your oldest friend. You don't belong in the Big World. You don't belong anywhere. You shouldn't even exist. Moxy, I'm so sorry I lied. So there's no Big World for us? No kid waiting? I'm so sorry, everyone. This is all my fault. I should never... Moxy, wait! Wait! Now, Ox, I'm an amazingly magnanimous guy, so I'll tell you what: Go back to Uglyville. Live your little ugly lives. Never come back here. And if you do, it's Recycling for everyone. I bet they'll be back. That little pink one never gives up. Yes, well, neither do I. Extra! Extra! People of Uglyville are revealed to be... "Rejects"? Who'd have thunk? We heard it straight from Ox's mouth. Yep, it's time to wake up and smell the ugly. Just the bag, please. Whee! I've arrived! I can't wait to learn about this magical place and all my... Oh. I wish I could say it wasn't so. Things will never be the same around here. Brother, can you spare a button? Hard times. Hard, hard times. Sorry, Uglyville. Ugh! Hey, yo. Wake up. Or don't. It doesn't matter. I wish I was sleeping. I don't know why I'm up all early in the morning. I can't do this anymore. Did that make you feel better? Mandy? What are you doing here? Moxy, you have to go back and complete the Gauntlet. - There's no point. - That's where you're wrong. All your life you knew the truth and you never stopped believing. And you were right! I never would have had the courage to come here if it weren't for you. If you give up now because you're not perfect, what hope do the rest of us have? With five eyes or wedged heads or glasses? You need to fight, Moxy.

Oh, hello, Mandy. Lou's gonna love this. - Whoa! - Hey! We are getting so good at kidnapping, right? Let us out, you beautiful monsters! Whoa! Lou? What you doing here? You didn't think I was gonna miss all the fun, did you? You did miss the whole climbing down, kidnapping, dragging, climbing back up, being tired part. I see you brought Mandy, too. How delightful. But you told us to bring Moxy back to you and... I came up with a far better plan. What are you doing? You've already crushed their spirits. Sure, Uglyville may be crushed, but we both know Moxy will never give up. Without you around, the rest of them will stay away forever. The only reason I let you stay in Perfection was to keep up appearances. Everybody says, "Oh, Lou, you're so nice! You're the best!" Do you know how long I've worked for that adulation? Those Pretty Dolls, they're mine. They hang on my every word. And if you think I'm gonna let you take that away from me, you're as empty-headed as the rest of them. You're both ugly. And ugly things belong in Recycling. - No! - You can't do this! Ox disrupted the system, but I'll fix it. We'll see each other again soon. You'll be brand-new. You'll be perfect! Please, sir. Can I have some more? - Um... a little bit more. - Ugh. Bless you, sir. Perhaps even a little... Get lost, Oliver. It's tough times all over. Where's Moxy? Wouldn't you hide too if you were responsible for all of this? Whoa! It's not all her fault. I mean, I just went along with it without so much as a bark. All I wanted to do was help her get a look inside that magic flower. It all started with the tea leaves. My tea leaves. Oh, yeah. I never tried to talk to her out of it. I thought it was a great idea all along. Don't drag me into your little pity party. Hmph! It's all my fault! I've always wished I could be as brave as Moxy. But I've always been afraid of my own shadow, and I saw this as an opportunity to step outside of my comfort zone. It's got to get better than this, right? Oh, look at us. We're falling to pieces. I'm gonna go talk to Moxy, and we're gonna make things right. I need something stronger than this soup. Moxy? Hello? Oh, no. What? Did you see anything? Huh? What? Oh, no. Moxy, just give it up. We've already tried. Huh? Uh... No. No! Oh, no! No! Aah! - Moxy! - Ox! - Let's go! - We got you. Ready, Wage? Now! We can't hold this forever! - Hold on! - Hold on tight! Whoo! Whoa! No! Babo! Oh, no! - Come on, Babo! - Stretch, Babo, stretch! So long, Ugly world! I'm not gonna make it! - Yeah! - Yes! - Okay, pull! - Pull! - Pull! - Pull! - Hyah, Willard! - Whoo-hoo! Yes! Whoo-hoo! Whew. I'm lucky you got that thing on your head, whatever it is. No, Gibberish Cat, we're not just going home. If Lou tried to recycle us, then no one is safe. Moxy's right. I lived my whole life being afraid, but never again. We need to take a stand. All of us! But how? We're rejects! I read it in the paper. We are not rejects. Our flaws make us who we are. You know what? We have enough flaws for every doll in Perfection and then some. I have three brains! And me, I'm shaped like a spork! See this head? It's a wedge! And I'm greedy with the soup! Those are all worth fighting for! Well, maybe not being greedy with the soup, but the others! Now let our freak flags fly! Attention, please. All Gauntlet runners must immediately report to the starting area. Ooh! Ahh! Are you ready for the Gauntlet? I'm ready! ♪ I said, "Are you ready?" ♪ Yes! Excuse me. Sorry. Coming through. Mandy. How unexpected. Step aside, model/engineer. - Watch out. - Hey, watch the plush! Coming through, coming through. Pegacorn coming through. Hello, old friend. Oh, this is rich. This is really rich. You can't possibly think you'll pass. Maybe we will. Maybe we won't. But every doll in this stadium is gonna see us try. You know what, Lou? When I first got here, I thought you were perfect. I couldn't find a single thing wrong with you. But I can see a lot better now. What! Yes. Yes, you'll run the Gauntlet. And I'm gonna run it with you. I wanna run your Gauntlet, Lou! Yeah! Activate the core. Intimidating warm-up grunts. You? Run the Gauntlet? I don't even have to win. I just need to make sure you lose. And when I'm done, I'll have my loyal subjects escort each and every last UglyDoll to Recycling... where you belonged in the first place. Now, as you all know, the Gauntlet is designed to simulate real-world obstacles. The participants must make it through the doggy door and cross the finish line to win. Go, Moxy! Yes! - Yeehaw! - Tallyho, Moxy! Let's go! Help me! - Whoa! - Whoa! Lou, we have to save him! Leave him! He's a lost cause. He's gone forever. I'm over here! You could grab my hand! There's nothing we could've done. Good doggy. You call that a dog? It's all right, guys. Slick Dog's got this. What are you doing? Havin' fun, gettin' crazy, gettin' loose! Go! I'll stall him. Go, go, go! Yes! - Huh? Go, team! - Hey! Lou! I totally don't deserve this! Uh-oh. I'm starting to think Lou's just not that into me. Heads up, everyone! Time to clean up this mess. - Forever. - Moxy! - Go, Moxy! Keep going! - Come on! Yeah! Yeehaw! - Yeah! - Yay! Let's go! Yes! Stairs. Stairs. Stairs! You don't wanna do this, Baby. No! Ox! Are you okay? My head feel not good. - Oh! - Whoa! Hey! Is it okay for a pet to have their own pet? Yes! - Yeah! - Whoo-hoo! Unhand me, you annoying little hazard. Let go now! Did you see that? Who kicks a baby? Boo, Lou! - Moxy! - Come on, Moxy! You're almost there. It's okay. Don't cry. You'll be okay. No. Sorry we didn't pass. But how? You did it, Moxy. Gauntlet bypassed! Love and compassion are the doll's true purpose. Run celebration protocol. Time to party! For an Exposition Robot, that guy is pretty cool. Look! Well, I guess the cat's out of the bag. You failed? How could you fail? You still don't get it. Of course I failed. I'll always fail! - I'm a prototype! - What? "Prototype" is, like, a good thing, right? No! He ain't a real doll, girl. You thought that I stuck around this place because I cared so much about you mindless sycophants? "Sycophants" is, like, a good thing, right? Ugh! No, you imbecile! - Is "imbecile" a good thing? - My gut says, "Yeah." I'm the model! The mold! Sent by the factory to help guide you through. Sounds amazing, right? - Uh... - Wrong! Prototypes are not meant for public consumption. I was never allowed to go to the Big World, but you could! How could someone as ugly as you be accepted and loved while someone as perfect as I never could and never will? Let's see how you feel when you're trapped in this place forever, just like me. Come on! It was all a lie? Dolls don't need you or your training. You did it all just to feel powerful? What happened to you? We were like brothers. You, a reject, were gonna leave me, just like the others. Ever wonder why the Pretties turned on you? It was you! You tried to have me recycled! You wanted to leave so bad, I sent you right where you belong. Ow. Whoa! The only thing I did wrong was I should have waited to make sure you were recycled. Whoa! I need a boost! I got nothing. Lou, no! Don't do this! - Ready! - Fire! Destiny time! Huh? No! No! No! - Good dog. - Girls! Girls! Are you gonna let them take over? After everything I've done for you? So where do you want him, boss? Hmm. I haven't decided. Any suggestions? Tear the stuffing out of him! - Shred that liar, honey! - Let the dog have him! - Give him back to the baby! - No, please! I know I'm not perfect, but I deserve a second chance. Look into your heart. Look into your heart! Um, I have an idea. No! Do you know how expensive this suit is? Dry-clean only! Hey, guys?
