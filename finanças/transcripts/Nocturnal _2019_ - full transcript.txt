NOCTURNAL You cheeky little bastard! It's mine. You never take this off? My dad gave it to me for my communion. -Not even when you're in the shower? -Nope. Never. What did you think when you first saw me? I thought you were fucking hot. But Mike was there. You didn't care that I was with someone? I had a feeling that you wouldn't really mind you were with someone. What? What? Suz? -What's up with ya? -It's been months since I left Mike. Yeah, and we've been seeing each other and that. Seeing each other? We only ever meet here. You've never even been to mine. How long have you lived here? There's no fucking picture on the wall. -Come on, things are nice with us. -Nice? Yeah, it's really nice as it is. It could be so much better than this. Is this really enough? I'll get the rest of me bits when I have the car. And my lamp. Fine. Fine, fine, fine! "Yeah, it's really nice as it is." Fucking bellend! "Really nice as it is." -I've nearly done it all. -Oh, it's about time. Took you ages. Well, you'll miss me. Says who? Sure I'll see you later. After your shift. I've got a boyfriend. -He can get involved if he wants. -Yeah? I'll ask him. Hey, Jade. Hey. -Do you wanna hang out this weekend? -I'm working, love. Oh, of course. -I'll see you later, love. -Yeah. What were we saying? Well, that's nice. Just turn your back to me, then. Pete. Pete. Have you gone off me now? All right, girls, that's it. Let's come in. -What you up to tonight? -Have a party. You? -Going out with some school friends. -Oh, nice. I need to tell you something. Let me tell you something. I need to tell you. I need to tell you. Come back, Laurie! That's it, very nice, come on. Were you watching me? I work here, just doing bits and bites. Doesn't look like you're working. You normally run this time of night, do you? -You would know, wouldn't you? -Hey, hang about. Do you want a fag? Could offer you a lift home if you want. Oh, really? Thanks. Gonna help me get on the telly, maybe on "Crimewatch" washed up in an estuary? We've been here six months and we're still unpacking! Junk. More junk. You could help me with this, you know? Hello? What? You gonna talk to me? Don't wait for me for dinner, I have plans. Did you have fun? Simone, arms! I've... I've done this trial thing. To be a model. You know, like for online stuff. -Trial? -Yeah. You just kinda, like, send a couple pics of yourself. They make you whip your knickers off, don't they? Not exactly, but you do have to be super sexy. And if they like it, well, you get paid a shit ton of money. You should maybe try it. Yeah. No. -I'm gonna go. -Yeah. Got P.E. Such a good girl, aren't you? I'm taking the piss. I'll see you later, love. Now walk for 10 seconds. Oi, Laurie, Danny's on his way. You know Danny, don't you? Track champion. Is this why you're training with the track team? No other track in this shithole, is there? -What? Dublin is fucking London? -Yeah. Compared to here. -Why don't you go back, then? -Maybe I will. Hey, gorgeous. Oh, my God. Ms. A is gonna have a fit if she sees you. -We're going to town tonight. -30 seconds left! We're heading down to YUX. No, I can't. It's Angel's 17th, innit? -Oh, come on. -No, no. Laurie's getting jealous. We was together the other night when you were calling. And run! Danny! Back to school, now! Keep moving. One more, ladies! Let's go. Look at Laurie. You're a creepy fuck. You've got balls. Look, Laurie's trying to get herself a boyfriend. You're still trying to get me in your car? I could have moved straight to the blow to the head. Stick you in a barrel of hydrochloric acid. -What's your name? -Pete. What's yours? -Like Peter Sutcliffe? -Well, yeah. I was named after him. My name is Rose West. -Can I have a cigarette? -Yeah. Of course, yeah. Laurie! Back to the class! We could go out for an ice cream somewhere. What, am I 12? 11 p.m. at the arcade. Bring the car, yeah? And the acid. Yeah, bangin'! Are you sure this is the way to the YUX? Yeah, of course, I am. Laurie. How did you know my name? -I saw it on your rucksack, didn't I? -Oh, yeah? Only a sensible girl would put her own name on her rucksack. Your mum sew that one on for you, did she? Normally get in cars with strangers do ya? Do you normally invite strangers into your car? You're the first one. -Hi, a VK Blue, please? -Yeah. Of course. -What the fuck is that? -Everybody drinks them. Fuck that. We'll have two whiskies, please, neat. Yeah. Coming right up. Thank you. -How many rooms are there? -There's three floors here. -Two more, please. -Yeah, sure. -I'll get two more, please. -Yeah. Sure. This must be how you reel them in. How the fuck else would I reel them in? So what's your job? Or do you even have a job? Take over people's homes, make 'em mine for a bit. -You're a squatter. -If you want, yeah. Me too. I grew up in the streets. Bollocks. -I know your type. -Oh, yeah? What's that then? You're mummy's little princess, aren't ya? Back in a sec. -Could I have another one? -No worries. -Bangin' top. -Thanks. Come on. -Get up! -Why are you making me go home? -Can't be doing with babysitting, now. -It's not even 2:00 AM. I'm gonna make my own way home. Get up. -Now! -No. Get up now! Fuck! Little Laurie? Trying to make me jealous with this guy? -Fuckin' hell. -This is my husband. Say hello. Some things in life only a man can give you. Was he the last one left? Nobody likes you. Tramp. -Best apologize, boy. -Hey, it's just banter. Hey, we're all right, aren't we, Laurie? See? Dickhead. Thank you. Oh, Jesus. Fucking what? Laurie. Oh, hi. I've lost the whale. Where is the whale? Fuck it. That hurt. I'm in pain! Oh, no way. I need a timeout. Timeout. All right. Abandon ship. What are you doing? That was the coolest shit I've ever seen. -You can have that. -I don't want to eat that. I do not want to eat that. -What are you doing? -Take this. -I don't need that. -It's okay. It's fine. -I don't need that. -Fuck off. Here. Thanks. How do I look? You look like the best thing I've ever seen. -What's this? -Oh, fucking bollocks. Peter Rayne. Painter-decorator. Two mysteries solved in one go. Yeah. Busted. Case cracked. Nice one, Sherlock. Yeah. You've really don't look like a painter-decorator. -What? -Like, you'd be like a... Like a guitarist or something. -Fucking guitarist? -Yeah. -Or just some weirdo. -Yeah. -Where do you live? -Nowhere suitable for a posh life. I am not posh. I can burp the alphabet in like 30 languages. -Really? -Yeah. We'll have a conversation when you can fart the National Anthem. -Deal. -How about that? Done. Oh, shit. I think I have to go. -Mummy calling you, is she? -No. Wait. What? For you. Thank you. Look after my jacket. How are you getting on? Yeah, bangin'. Just finished prepping and I'll get started. All right. And you'll be back next week to do the upstairs room. -And the week after as well. -Very good. We'll leave you to it. What have I said to you last time? What have I... Fucking bastard! Should I tell your dad about what you been doing? You don't know my dad. I know he'll come running when I nail your backside to that lamppost, right? Hey, you Laurie. Fuck off. Why were you hurting that child? He looked at me funny. -Here. I kept your jacket safe. -Thank you. So this is where you live. Cool. I thought you'd live in like a cave or something. Not bad. You don't have to say that. Let's fuck off, come on. Where are we going? Oh, fuck. Hang on. I need to lock the door. Little bastard'll nick my fucking paints again. Stay there. I'll be right back. When I was a kid, my mum used to say "Look over there" and she told me it was Las Vegas. Did you believe her? Yeah. Of course. Have you ever been? Never left the UK, me. Mum's got family in Rotterdam. You know, always telling me to come visit and that. Learnt a bit of Dutch as well. Tot ziens. What's that? "Goodbye". So why haven't you been? Maybe I was waiting to meet you. Fuck off. -Where are you taking me? -Hang on. Hang about, you'll see. Bear with me a little bit, though. Because it's been a while. What are you talking about? When I was a bit younger, right? Used to come down here. A while ago, but? Trust me for a minute. -Did that. -Really? -That's cool. -Well, it's all right. Could you teach me? Doubt it. I mean, it was fucking ages ago now. Ages ago? How old are you? Thirty-three. Thirty-three? Like Jesus. Better than Jesus. Oh, was he 33, was he? The other day I was painting the living room in someone's house, right? I'm on all fours, like, mixing the paint, you know. Cutting into the skirting boards and I look up and I see my signature in the corner, from ages ago. Because I put my initials somewhere hidden on the wall after I paint it. And I didn't realize but I was back in the same house, painting the same walls. Everyone gets on with their life They just... get married, have kids. Travel. Everyone who? Laurie. Yeah? You look like your mum. How would you know? I saw her picking you up at the track, didn't I? Well, like, maybe when she was younger. She's all old and stressed out and shit. Why? Because her boyfriend left her. And my Nan died like, kinda simultaneously. Sorry about your Nan. I barely knew her. She had a bit of a chip on her shoulder that Mum went to raise me so far away and live in Dublin and? What about your dad? -My dad? -Yeah. Just some random guy who didn't want anything to do with me. Your mum told you that, didn't she? Sort of. Maybe she wasn't telling the truth. He's never been in touch, so? Maybe he didn't know how to do it. Yeah. In 2018 with Facebook and Google, and everything, he didn't know how. Nah. Would you want to know him? I don't care about him. He's just like some loser who knocked up my mum and ran. Mark's the one I miss, though. He was the best. Mum's boyfriend, is it? -Ex-boyfriend. -Ex-boyfriend. Yeah. Are you okay? I should get you home, really, shouldn't I? Can we go to yours first? I feel kinda sick. I think I need to eat something. -Is the heating on? -Yeah. Here. -Eat something. -I'm not hungry. What? Nothing. Come back. Do it or I won't give you what you want. I don't want anything. Pete? Who's this? His cousin. -Got me from the cousin shop. -Shut it. -Want some food? You look hungry. -Just came for some things. It's not what you think. She's a friend of a friend. -I'm not a friend. -Fuck's sake, Pete. Meet tomorrow and I'll explain, all right? Explain this? Seriously. Where's my lipstick? Laurie? -I've not seen it. I don't know. -You really are a bastard. Suz. Get your bits. We're going. I'm sorry if I got a bit out of order. I thought maybe I was a bit? It's not your fault. So... is that your girlfriend? Pete. You think you're too old for me, is that what it is? Can't go around telling people we're together. Hang on. Hang about. Laurie! Laurie? I never meant it like that. -What are you doing? -I'm walking home. -Where you off? -I'm walking home. -It's freezing. Let me give you a lift. -You're a creep, Will you just... -I don't fucking need you. -It's freezing. Fuck off. Laurie! Where have you been? It's a school night. -None of your business. -I'm sick of this attitude. Laurie! Oh, that's nice. Pete? Pete, what's wrong? What's wrong? What's the problem, Pete? Pete. Jeez. Pete, stop! Pete! Jeez! Fuck this! Hiya. Hi. You like it? Could you make it just like me old room in Mum's house? What's that like? It had stars in the ceiling and all me toys. Your mama and dad can do those things. I'm just the painter. But they're gone. Well, your nana or granddad can deal with them, then. All men seem to fall in love with me, Laurie. That's the bane of my life. And this is how you get them. Wanna do a couple more? Yeah. Maybe one or two. Can you take some of me? That's the spirit. Oh, for fuck's sake. -Can I just borrow you for a minute? -What are you doing here? You invited me. Ages ago and you said you weren't coming. You're not answering your phone. Just fuck off. Oh, fucking hell. Sorry. Mr. Jenkins. Hello. Bangin' costume. -I'm the party Santa Claus. -Got that, yeah. You did a great job in that old room. She loves the purple walls. -Cheers. -Cheers. Right. Back to the rocker we go. -Have a good one. -You bet. Just leave, will you? I know what you think you saw but it's not like that. -I think I saw? -Nothing going on there. What does "nothing" mean to you? Is there nothing between us either? I'm not fucking her. Fuck sake, Pete. I have really missed you. Then stop seeing her. Can't. Can't stop seeing her. I've got you this. Thank you. Happy nearly birthday. -Can you put it on? -Yeah. -Did you see the L on it? -Yeah. -Do you want me to do it? -No. Got it. Bangin'. I'll never take it off. Do you forgive me? What are you doing? -Shaking your hand. -Why? I don't know. Fuck off. Open the glove box. Chambrini. -Special offer, was it? -Yeah. Everything's special offer. Let's go. Come on. -What the fuck is that? -What do you think it is? -No. Absolutely not. -It's my birthday. -One! -I'm not doing that. It's my first time. I wanna take it with you. You're not doing it. -You want me to take it alone? -Laurie, have that. Don't? Take it alone. That's so disgusting. Fucking hell. How long does it take? You'll know when it's coming. You ever have braces? Two times? So when did you lose your first tooth? Really nice. Very solid. I don't remember. Try. Try. I was seven I think. The tooth fairy took it. You had chicken pox? And why do you care? Well, I want to know everything about you. Everything that I missed. -What? -Your face is so weird. You should go away, and then you should come back when I've forgot what you look like. Go away and then... You should go away. -This bed ain't big enough. -No. Very graceful. What are you doing? -What? Fucking hell. -Come here. Oh, wait. -Please. -I'm gonna kill you? -No, no. -I'm gonna fucking kill you. Please don't. I have to finish two houses. No. Please. Disarmed. Health and safety. You're fucking tripping balls. Look at your eyes. -Laurie! -What? No. Why not? Do you not want me? What? What's really wrong? What, Pete? Are you with that girl or what? Oh, no. No, I don't care if you are. You'll hate me. -You'll proper hate me. -I'll never hate you. You'll never wanna see me again. I promise I'll never hate you. I promise. -Promise me you'll never hate me. -I promise. Can't we just be... -Let's just be friends. -No. -I love you, Pete. -Let's just be friends. No. I love you. -We should be friends. -No. Get dressed. No. -Get dressed. -No! Please. Please get dressed. Get dressed. No. We're actually relatives. We're related. What do you mean? We're related. What do you mean? I banged your mum when I was 17. You fucked my mum? How are we related? How are we related? -How are we... -I'm your dad. It's true. -That's not funny. -It's true. Your mum is Jean Kilcline. Her mum is Norva Kilcline. Goes by Newman. She grew up in the fucking same house you're living in now. Jean had just broken up with someone. She was living at home again. She was older than I was. Your nana hired me for a fucking paint job. That's how we met. I just wanted to know you. Laurie? I just wanted to know you. You can't. -It's 4:00 a.m. -Get away. You're fucked. You're fucked. Have the bed. Stay here. We can talk about it tomorrow. That's what we should do. We should talk about it tomorrow. Laurie. -Laurie. -Fuck off, Pete. I just wanted to know you. That's all. I just wanted to know you. Mr. Ashelford. You got a charger? -For what phone you got? -Samsung. Ain't got one for that. Pete? Pete? Laurie? Laurie! When you're ready, I think I need to know what's been going on with you. They had to pump your stomach. There was a man waiting outside the house this morning. Waiting for you. You've been speaking to him? You've been seeing him? Is he really my dad? -You're old enough to be his mum. -That's not true. I don't care. You're disgusting. What's he said to you? When we met, I knew he was young, but I didn't know he was that young. There are times in life when people are reckless. And I'm glad that I was because I wouldn't have had you. I wanted to give you every opportunity in the world. And that's why I took you away, far away from here. Away from him? Do you think he wanted to be involved? Hiya, Jean. Looking for Laurie. She's been stopping at her mate Jade's house for the past few weeks. Thought you'd have known that. I've not spoke to her. You've written her a letter? Why did you come back here? You knew I'd meet her eventually. I thought you would've left. That's what you kept saying back then. Guess it was all talk. Oh, I'm leaving now. Two tickets. I'm gonna ask her to move away with me. She hates is around here. She's 17. So was I. Pete. If you want to be a father then do what's best for her, not you. Come on. Faster now. Very good. Oi, knees! Bloody hell. Very nice. Relax those arms. Good, good, good. Right to the edge. Straight, straight, straight. Good. Arms to nose. Who's next? Go on, Anna. Very good. Very good. Let's go, go, go, go, go. Come on! Quick! Excellent. Thanks for coming. You have five minutes and then I'm going. You blocked my number. Why aren't you running? -Are you gonna explain or... -I wanted to tell you. When? I shouldn't have listened to her. I just didn't want you to hate me. Yeah. Well, you did. And I do. All right. You want cod, haddock, or plaice? -Cod. -Cod. Anything else? -Two beers. -One beer. Okay. Hey, look at that. Seagull with one leg. There's no such thing as a seagull. It's a herring gull, standing on one leg, like a twat. That's a bit harsh on all the birds what... what have lost a leg. I'm leaving tomorrow morning on the ferry. I'm moving to Rotterdam. What do you want me to say? Congratulations? -When are your next school holidays? -I'm quitting school. You got a good head on you, you have. I don't want your life being like mine. Thanks for the advice, Dad. Are you done? One way or another, I've wondered about you for a long time now. When I saw your mum picking you up in that car park? You were real then, and I wanted to know you. When I did know you, the idea of not knowing you became a thing I couldn't allow to happen. -I'm not missing another 17 years. -Yeah, but you're leaving. And you'll visit. After you finish school, you'll come up for longer maybe, if you want. I fucked up. I know. I know it's been shite. I ain't got time to hang about round here. Everyone thinks I'm a fucking paedo now. Except I don't have the option of fucking off. I know. -Laurie. -Just going to the toilet. I love you. I love you. Yeah. Yeah. -Tot ziens. -You're just making 'em up now. I'm not. It's from the... I read it in the dictionary. So maybe you could move away with me. Yeah? I'm gonna move away with you. Where are we gonna live? Big fuck-off castle with turrets and a drawbridge. I just wanna know everything about you everything I missed. Pete! You be good, yeah? I will. Don't get in any cars with any strangers, right? Dickhead! Well, go on then. Come visit.
