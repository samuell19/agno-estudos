I'm Sergeant Tsvetkova. I've brought new orders. Your field phone -- it's down. They're out of men? They're sending girls now? The messenger was killed. They sent me instead. You're not going to read it? I already know what it says. "No retreat." Retreat means court-martial and execution. They'd be better off sending in reinforcements than trying to scare me. Your new company, sir. - Lower. - Stay lower. - Stay low. - Now go. GO, go! Come on. These? I'll tell you where you can shove them. I need soldiers, not professors and students! Lieutenant, didn't you hear me? Take the company and advance! Don't raise your voice at me, you snot-nosed brat! I have my order, too, Lieutenant. You think I won't carry it out? Stay low. Comrades Militiamen! If you don't have a weapon, grab one off the dead! If there aren't enough around, pick weapons up on the battlefield! All right, GUYS- Platoon! Attack, Lieutenant! Where do you think you're going? Get out of here! This is no place for you! Follow me! Attack! Hurrah! Stay low! Stay low! Keep low! For the Motherland! Charge! Where are you going? Get back there! I said get back there! Tsvetkova, what are you doing? Enough retreating! We've already retreated all the way back to Leningrad! For the Motherland! - For Stalin! For Leningrad! - Stop! You can't go there! You're not authorized! Hurrah! They're retreating! For Leningrad! You don't scare me! I am disappointed, von Leeb, very disappointed. You promised to take Leningrad by July. Then by August. It's now the end of September. But the city is completely surrounded, mein Fuhrer. But not taken! I am moving the point of attack to Moscow. I'm giving von Bock the 1st and 6th tank divisions. But... these are my divisions. Gopner's group, Reinhardt's corps, the 36th Motorized Division, and Manstein's tanks. This morning, I appointed Zieglmeier Deputy Superintendent of the Army. Formerly, he was... Director of the Munich Food and Nutrition Institute, mein Fuhrer. ...our body must receive fuel in order for the heart, the lungs, and all other organs of the body to function. Our body is like any other engine, gentlemen, and, in physiology, this fuel is calculated in calories. 2,000 calories per day is the minimum amount for our body to sustain life. Listen, von Leeb. Guess what's going to destroy Leningrad instead of you. According to our latest intelligence, the daily ration in Leningrad is down to 300 grams of bread per day. That's only 500 calories. Wheel it in. The Fritzes! They're digging in! We've stopped them! We've stopped them! 300 grams of bread. Breakfast. Lunch. Dinner. A very healthy diet, indeed. Total extinction will be when? If our troops maintain the siege -- What are the time limits? Three months maximum. By January of '42, two million people will die of starvation. Two-thirds of the population of Leningrad, mein Fuhrer. Leningrad is blocked by German troops in all directions. Food supplies are all but completely out off. CENTRAL TELEGRAPH OFFICE MOSCOW Only one very narrow corridor, across Lake Ladoga, is still open and controlled by Russian troops. The situation becomes more precarious by the day. Some food is getting through to the city by the Ladoga Waterway, but it is minuscule and fails to meet the needs of the population. - Can you hear me? - Next paragraph. Hospitals are beginning... In addition to the constant artillery shelling and aerial bombardment, cruel October storms begin to hit Lake Ladoga. Only one in 20 barges carrying relief supplies to Leningrad makes it through to safety. Can you live without him for five minutes? Who? Mr. Parker will show. Oh, him. I'm not waiting for him. Apart from the Pulitzer Prize, what is so great about your Mr. Parker? Wow! Redder than the Soviet flag. Wait till you see it unfurl. - High heels... - Would you prefer me in those God-awful ugly boots I have for Leningrad? I cannot believe we're finally going! After three months of those endlessly phony Moscow press releases. Well, actually, Kate, it's one reporter, one country. England is sending Finley, and The Times outranks your Telegraph. I'm sorry, Kate. I'm not going? There wasn't anything I could do. But you know how long I've waited for this chance to get to the front, Phil. Yes, but if this thing happens, it will only be for a day. We'll go in at dawn, we'll get out at dusk. There'll be nothing to see, I promise you. Look! There's your pal Chigasov. The one you keep knee-deep in booze and cigarettes. If you tell him to put me on the reporter list, he will. Go on, Phil! Tell him, and it'll be done! Kate, I want you to be safe. If it was up to me, I'd send you somewhere far away from here. - What? - Like Australia or... wherever. That's what this is? Oh, Katie! How rude of me! I seem to have abandoned my dancing partner. Kate... See you in Leningrad, Phil. Two weeks later This is Leningrad speaking. This is the Soviet Information Bureau reporting. During the night, our troops fought the enemy over the entire front. Kirovsky Factory HAIL TO THE GREAT LEADER! Once again, your mission -- to ensure absolute order. No lines anywhere, no panic-mongers or whiners. Stay out of sight of any foreigners. Mission clear? Yes, sir! Proceed! The city has 7 days' worth of flour left, 8 days' of grain. 14 days' of fats and oils. Sugar? Sugar‚Äù Three days' worth of sugar. And because we've been graced with five -- oh, forgive me -- six, six foreign journalists, it's been decided to split everyone into six groups. One foreigner per group, and each with a designated area. Why split us up? Frankly, I cannot possibly afford to lose the entire foreign press corps in one incident. Can I, Mr. Finley? I'm going with the antiaircraft unit and then on to Lake Ladoga. Hmm. The very best assignments before they're even announced. Why don't you join me? Perhaps you'd like to write my piece for me as well. All right, break it up. Get going! No bread today! - Disperse! - But we've been here since 5:00 a.m.! Go home now! Look there... For one little foreign poodle, they put on an entire show, while people will now have to trudge God knows where to get some bread. Hide! Hide! Let's go! Quick, chase them away! Hurry! Katya, where are you? Over here! Time to go. Walter! You are a good pilot! Think about the Knight's Cross. Is it true Hitler issued a secret directive? The plan is to no longer take Leningrad, but to wipe it off the face of the earth? Yes, because the Russians are so stubborn with their pointless resistance. And I always thought that the Russians were the barbarians. Yes. German reconnaissance group, but we threw them back. You can take pictures. Ten minutes. Then we move on. Attention! This is an air-raid alert from the Air Defense Command. Attention! This is an air-raid alert! To the shelter! Get to the bomb shelter, hurry! Okay... A trophy! I'll hang it on the office wall. You are not put off? Not disgusted? Well, I worked at the crime scene for two years. Dead bodies at the morgue almost every day. Every day? I see. Vernik here is from Leningrad. What did you write about before the war? Exhibitions, mainly. Art department. Forget the horse! Go! Come on, go! Are you all right, Vernik? Five, four, three, two, one! Germans! Get back in the bus! Quickly! We can make it to the bomb shelter! Chocolate! My daughter will be very happy. Vernik, go! - Hurry! - Faster! Come on, come on, come on! Hurry! Come on, Vernik! For God's sake! Let's get the hell out of here! Come on, come on, come on, come on! - We're coming! - Kate! Hold on! Wait for us! We're coming! Get down! Get down! Vernik, run! Run, Vernik! Ah! Ageyeva, where are you going? We're going to look for the journalists. It seems like they got bombed. The foreign lady, too. Tsvetkova! You stay here. If there's a call from Headquarters, tell them everyone's out searching. Yes, sir. - Proceed. - Yes, sir. Let's go. Do you COPY? Hello? 20-44. Hello? Yes, 20-44. Headquarters, do you copy? The bus with the English journalist never made it back. Where is she? Where was the bombing? There is bombing all over Leningrad, Parker. You knew that when we added Ms. Davis to our list. Sorry. Korneyev! Korneyev! I don't get it, is that a person out there? Some broad. Stop! Comrade journalists, this is the captain speaking. You must board now. We must make it to Moscow before dawn. Drink. Please, a drink. Gals! She's not Russian. So, where is your spy? There, in the truck. We picked her up. We don't get what she's babbling, so we thought... Oh, it's you. They found you. Why are you dragging, for God's sake? Kate! Kate! Let me through! I'm here, Kate! Get out of my way! Korneyev! Parker! No one else survived the bombing. Malinin! Recognize it? Is this hers? Parker, listen to me. Listen to me! Go to the airplane. Go! You have papers? Got it. No papers. Come on. Get up. Get up! Lady! Don't die on me! Please! What I am supposed to do with you? Easy, stay still. We've got to stop the bleeding. Attention! This is the Soviet Information Bureau reporting. Our sites in various sectors of the Western Front have been fiercely attacked by the Germans. Attention! ...through the Osinovets and Kokorevo piers, 9,800 tons of food were delivered in the last 30 days. While the city consumes 1,100 tons of flour a day alone, rationed at 400 grams of bread for workers and 200 grams for all others. How long can we hold out? - If we were to lower the rations -- - Are you out of your mind? Reduce the goddamn rations even more?! You want us to have a revolution on our hands? Nine days. Nine? So, nine days? Company, ready! Hi, there. Come on, come on, come on, get in! Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. Are you all right? I have dystrophy, like everyone these days. I'll help you. You shouldn't move. Tsvetkova asked to look after you while she's away. I'm Yura Krasko. I live upstairs. Make some calls! She's probably shell-shocked. I thought of taking her to the hospital, but if she kicks the bucket there, we're to blame. Make the call, then. All right, I'm calling. So, you're saying you've found the Englishwoman? Alive, right? I personally reported to Commissar Chigasov that the Englishwoman was killed. Killed? It means that I saw the dead body myself and personally identified it. That's half the trouble. The Commissar obviously called the Kremlin. They must've called the Embassy. Then it must've gone to England. Are we supposed to change the report now? What do we do, then? Kill her? October 6th -- all electricity was cut off. Is she under arrest? Who? Exactly. Who is she? Did you see her papers? She lost her papers. So you're trying to stick me with some broad with no papers? October 14th -- the water pipes burst. Your firearm. On the table! Now! Where is she? Answer me! Where? The phone they cut off on September 8th. Out there, on the motorcycle. In the sidecar. Come with me. - Well? - She ran away. It's my fault. I'll take full responsibility. Are you crazy? You are playing with fire. Do you know who's singing over there in the living room? Vozdvizhenskaya Anastassia Andreyevna herself, the biggest star of the Leningrad Operetta. It's my mom who's accompanying her, and Tsvetkova's mother is her housemaid here. But Tsvetkova is ashamed of her mother for being a servant. Huh... As soon as she heard the police took women, she joined, just to get away from here. These are all Tsvetkova's sports awards. She won them while at university before she became a cop. She set the city record in skiing, twice. It's she who taught me English. Take a look. Temporary refugee identification. The real deal. Got it at the station. Stole it. Never done this before. Now you can eat. I'll take it to Yura. No. Yura will have his own food. Eat! Cost me my life savings. Hm? Mmm. HOTEL SAVOY, MOSCOW - Phil. - Finley. This is your pilot, Wing Commander Bowman. - He'll fly you to London. - Sir. When you see her parents, um, tell them -- tell them that their daughter was a hell of a reporter. Gonzales, Ekaterina Garcievna. You are a Spanish communist who escaped the bloody hands of Franco's fascist regime. I am? We don't have British political immigrants here, but quite a few Spanish barely speak Russian, like you. Please, memorize this. You were on vacations here. Then the war and bombing, and everything you got is gone. Why must I pretend? You will, unless you want to be shot on the spot by the first patrol you meet. Never leave the house without this. Who knows? You may even end up getting coupons. Coupons? Food coupons, for bread. I'll give you some. Look, um, you're being extremely kind, and I appreciate it very much, but I shan't be staying here that long. I'll be going back to Moscow. They must be looking for me by now. You think I need you here? There you go. Three days' worth. And, believe me -- no one is looking for you. No one. You died. It's in everybody's reports. And there is no way these reports can be changed. Look, you don't understand. I work for a daily newspaper, and I must file daily reports to London. I can't stay here a week or a month or a year. Look around you. Do you see little Yura? Do you see half our city can't even get out of bed. "Stay for a week." Try to survive just one day. This is Leningrad speaking. The following is the new bread-ration decree of the Government Food Supply Commission. Workers, their spouses, and children -- 150 grams a day. GROCERY STORE Lowered rations again! Bread! Give us some bread! Starved by our own! Let the Germans in! At least they'll feed us! Who said "Germans"?! Disperse these bastards! Go home! Disperse! - Air raid! Get down! - Down! Get down! Get away. It's on delay. It could blow up any second. People! Look! See what it says! Sugar! It's sugar! SUGAR I'm telling you, it's sugar! The Germans dropped sugar for us! Exactly! While our own starve us to death! There are no real bombs like that! Why are we staring at it? - Just open it! - Are you out of your mind? What are you doing? Step aside. Stay back! Stop it! Idiots! Stop! Are you blind? Have you gone crazy? It's a bomb! Stay back! Get back to your senses! Do you really think the Germans would drop sugar? It's a bomb! You'll all die! That's it. All makeup's been stolen. Anastassia Andreyevna. I know, I know. They are using it to fry food. They eat lipstick, right? Well, they've eaten it all. As our director, tell me, please, why they won't evacuate us. We are the last working theater in the city. Apparently, party headquarters needs us as a symbol. A symbol of what? Fine. I'll evacuate myself. I'll throw myself to any general. And if anyone refuses, I'll write to Zhdanov. I'll write to Stalin himself. As one symbol to another! Hello. See? Even Spaniards visit us, as if life goes on as before. Hire her as a stagehand. She needs food coupons. Please, help my father! - I'm begging you, help! - Stay with the boy. An author of over 30 papers on astronomy... If we must burn something, Yura and I decided to start with the Germans. You know, he is a certified genius. That's what they wrote in The Leningrad Pravda. A treasure is found in Griboyedov district. Yes... That's my Yura. If it weren't for the war, he would be a chess master at 12 years old. He didn't even redeem his coupons. He just stayed on the couch all day. Nina's mom shared her spot in the line, so I redeemed mine. Hello. I'm Kate. Hello. I'm Sima. Yura is a genius, of course. But he is very weak. I'm strong. I used to go to ballet school. - Ballet school? - Sima, come here. This is for you, for tomorrow. And this for today. This is for Yura for tomorrow. You understand? This is for Yura for today. Go and give it to him. Wait. Give it back. This is for you, too. Go and give it to Yura. Mom, you made a mistake. It's too many for me. Do what I said! For 19 years, I studied in the laboratory... Oh, no! Come, sit down. Here, here. Swollen. I drink water all the time. Mother is right. I'm letting everyone down. You must never, ever say such a thing about yourself again. You'll recover, Yura. You'll be a chess champion. Hey? Something odd about your chessboard? Are you missing a man? No. Perhaps there's an extra one. Chocolate! Real chocolate! Go ahead! Eat it! You'll be all right, Yura. I promise, you'll be all right. Mmm. Where have you been? I've got to get back to the barracks. - Up at Sonya's - Mm. Saw her children. Here -- our Soviet vodka. I saved it from before the siege. Drink! It's a must. Bottoms up! And what is there to celebrate? It's your birthday today. Oh... No, my birthday is in July. Check your refugee ID. When I filled it out, I made up the date. And today I noticed. A birthday -- time for gifts! What have you done? I'm not telling. You have to look. Reporter! Then write! Happy birthday! Ah! We're using up all the kerosene and candles. A holiday is a holiday! Now tell me about men. - Men? - Mm-hm. They have two arms and two legs -- make that three... I mean being with them -- loving, kissing, physical mechanics. Physical mechanics? Love is not funny. It is when I do it. Recognize it? Show me how to make the guys drool. Tell me about your Mr. Parker. Oh, Mr. Parker. I think he must have had about a thousand women. In the bed? He just seemed to know how to do... How to touch you so the electricity just runs through your body... How to hold you, how to caress you... And then... how to undress you. Slowly... Slowly... And then? And then... And then, you just stop thinking. You realize that there is no shame. You can do anything with him. Your bodies belong to you both at once. And nobody needs to tell you a thing. You've known it all along, you just need to take it in. It's yours... He's yours. Do you know that you are not going to see him again? Even You are not getting out of here. No one is getting out of here. Neither of us. This blockade will never end. EASTBOURNE, ENGLAND Mr. Parker! Mr. Parker, please forgive us. We went for a walk. We weren't expecting you so soon. I... took an earlier train. I'm Priscilla Davis, Kate's stepmother. Very nice to meet you. This is Kate's father. Grevitskiy Aleksei Valerianovich. Yes, the famous Russian White Guard general. We don't have to hide it anymore since Katya is no longer with us. Kate's mother, she died before the revolution, very young, in Switzerland, where Kate was born and spent her early years. When Alexei's army was defeated by the Bolsheviks, they ended up in England. Kate was 10. Not a penny to their name. So, Alexei wrote his renowned memoirs, and I edited and helped him get them published. We've been together ever since. Kate became a real Englishwoman. She even took my surname, Davis. That was a necessary precaution, because we'd worked hard for years to make sure that the KGB never guessed whose daughter she truly was. It was important to her, because she knew that sooner or later, in spite of everything, she would get back to Russia again. NKVD (STATE SECURITY) OFFICE MOSCOW This came last night from London. She was an Englishwoman from head to toe. But her homeland was Russia. That's where she was born, and that's where she died. As usual, Parker creates a sensation. Grevitskiy Aleksei Valerianovich. Nobleman, committed monarchist. Lieutenant General of the White Guard. Fought us all the way till 1920. And dear father to our "so very British" Kate Davis. We checked her through every channel. Including yours, by the way. We put her under a microscope and still missed it. Missed her or...? Or what? Think, Chigasov. Or British Intelligence outwitted us. POLICE Wait a minute. Aren't you on duty? I got some chow for my mother. Liar! You run off somewhere every day! Maybe you got yourself a girlfriend? Come on, tell me. Kiss me. Please. Kiss me. Come on, now. You know why I was called to the State Security Office? It's about your journalist, the one who escaped from the motorcycle. Old General Grevitskiy, ever heard of him? Affirmative, Comrade Senior Lieutenant. - My father fought him. - That's right. And he's the father of your phony English journalist. - What? - That's right. White Guard, Enemy of the People. So, I'm thinking now, if she didn't kick the bucket, someone must be helping her stay alive, out of kindness and ignorance. But if that someone knows who she is, that would be treason to the Motherland. With all of its consequences. Katya, where are you? Sonya. It was a smaller audience today. Everyone seems to have lost hope. And you, Sonya? Do you still have hope? I know we'll break this siege, soon. Is that why you keep taking from Yura's ration? - What? - And secretly add to your daughter's. Are you seeing things? Yes, I punished Yura once -- It's not just once! And you know it. I give Sima from mine, too, almost all of it. Yes, but that's your choice. Yura has nothing to do with it. Yura will die anyway. And so will I. And you, too, most likely. But Sima has a chance. And you -- who are you to say this to me? What can you do for Yura, except lying to him? What? What are you talking about? I don't know what you promised him -- chocolates every day or just a miracle. Sure, you meant well, but I can't do miracles. Neither can you. The stores were closed today... ...but here's what I got at the black market. Human filling? God forbid, Anastassia Andreyevna. Onions. What did you swap for it? The earrings. I kept the big ring. Hello, Katya. The Fuhrer is very unhappy about the situation in Leningrad, General. That's why he sent me to see you. Yes, the Russians are desperately holding onto life. But what else should they do? They've lowered the daily ration an additional 100 grams? Yes, and the ration will be lowered again. The sea will be covered by ice, so shipping will be a journey to hell. And now the Russians are hoping for ice. What are they going to do with it? Eat it? They want a pathway, a road on the ice. But in three weeks, the ice won't be thick enough yet to carry the weight of trucks. Even nature is on Germany's side. That means? That means, of course, in three weeks, the city of Leningrad won't exist anymore. This is Leningrad speaking, broadcasting a decree of the Government Food Supply Commission about lowering bread rations. In order to avoid disruptions in food supply... Hey, what are you doing? It's alive! It's alive! Go away! 125 grams for civilians and children. Canned meat? It's American. Straight from the front. Oh, it's you. Perfect that it's you. Everybody is in the theater already, waiting to know when we'll be evacuated. What will I go with? When I had the ring, I had hope. Of course! Eight carats. I saved your Spaniard, and from whom does she steal? From me! Sonya! Yura! Sima! It's only Yura there. He can't come to the door. - To the wall. - What? Ah! What are you doing? A thief. On top of everything else. Lies. Nothing but lies. The daughter of a White Guard general. Who do you spy for? Tell me! Spy! Please! An operatic diva, a bunch of stagehands, and a musical-comedy theatre? Now, there's a gold mine of wartime intelligence! Then why be here at all? Because all my life I dreamt of coming back to Russia! I worked myself to the bone to get here! And it's just as much my Russia as it is yours. I'll sip some hot water, then try another store. So now you know precisely who I am. And if you feel you must, you can arrest me. The guys who declared you dead, they are looking for you again. And sooner or later, they'll come to me. Keep the food. Don't go back to Anastassia's. From now on, we don't know each other. You survive? Great. Do your best. And you as well. Anastassia Andreyevna, Katya asked me to tell you -- Oh, Katya is staying? She asked me if I ever reach Moscow to pass a note to a journalist there. Everyone but you is being shipped to Kazakhstan. You have many more opportunities. "Phil Parker, Hotel Savoy, The New York Times Foreign Bureau..." An American and Katya? Believe me, I pleaded for everyone, but they're only shipping out artists and the like. Are you flying with me tomorrow? Why tomorrow? The day after. Tomorrow is for actors. And that's it for the theater. Nina! Don't even think about it! Mama. Why am I writing? Most likely, I'll burn these pages, just as we will burn all the books, furniture, and flooring to keep the stove going. The Nazis bombed the food warehouse. Now the market sells the glasses of warehouse dirt. Topsoil -- 100 rubles. Second meter down, 50 rubles. People believe the sugar and fat melted into the dirt. Add water to make tea -- quite filling and tasty, they tell me. They are playing Beethoven. German music... conducted by a Jew. You have asked for a leave, Walter? For what reason? I'm just a bit tired. People have seen you drunk a lot lately. So, I've already been denounced? You're doing everything you can to avoid a flying mission. You are given a lot of leeway because you are my nephew, but first and foremost, you are a soldier. I thought soldiers were fighting against soldiers. We are bombing defenseless civilians. Above all, I am still your general, Walter! Who orders me to shoot down anyone who's trying to leave the city? Of course, it makes sense. The more people stay in Leningrad... ...the less calories remain per person. That's Hitler's plan, isn't it? If this is, indeed, what we have become, Uncle Wilhelm, then Beethoven is a Russian or a Jew, but not a German. To hell with your cheap sentiments! Go and sleep it off in the barracks, and tomorrow you will fly as scheduled. I will personally see that my orders are carried out. We agreed that they'd pick me up here. Anastassia Andreyevna, I have a favor to ask. If you are in Moscow, by any chance... To give it to an American in the Hotel Savoy? How did you know? You fought with Katya because of me. Anastassia Andreyevna, please! Because of me, right? Because of some stupid ring. Here. Take this key. It's for the jewelry box. Take whatever you need. I don't need anything! Well, I do. I need you to survive. Both of you. Give me, an old hag, a reason to go on living. That's Malinin with his family. God, it's time. Promise me you will survive! Promise me! And now, just like when you were little, when you were a fat little brat, and not a boor, wearing these awful boots, give me a hug. Ninka! A painting... a basket... a hatbox... ...and a teeny-tiny little dog. It's so strange. Nobody but you was supposed to get out. And now Anastassia has left, we are leaving tomorrow, and you are the one who's staying. - Walter, how are you feeling? - I'm fine. Attention. This is Leningrad speaking. This is an air-raid alert from the Air Defense Command. Crank right, Polozkov! See it?! Fire! Fire! Track him, track him! Go, go, go! Fire! Walter, I'm done. It's your turn, Walter. - Don't hang behind! - I'm not! I'm looking for a target. Are you going for the antiaircraft artillery? Maintain altitude, Walter! Walter! Walter! This is suicide! Shit, Walter! This is suicide! You idiot! No! You will die, Walter! No! Fire! Misha, the raid's over. Misha. Misha! Misha... All right, guys! Most of the Southern sector is already frozen, except here. So run the route around it, or put it here or there. May I suggest we find the city's 9 or 10 best skiers? Send them. The real test is on foot. Osipov! Write up an order. Immediately. To form two groups, 12 people each. Two groups are too many, Comrade Zhdanov. Three groups, 12 people each. And immediately begin a search on foot across the lake. You have 24 hours. They won't make it back alive, Comrade Zhdanov. Out of three groups? Someone will. Yura... Are they still sleeping? I saved you something to eat. You've got to be strong today. It's your first ride on a plane. Isn't that great? Are you feeling all right today? Sonya? Sonya.Sonya! Sonya, wake up! Sonya! Mama! Kate! Kate Davis! Parker? You're here? The actress gave me your note. I knew you were still alive. I've got a car. Come, Kate, come! We'll take the children, there's a plane. It's time for you to go. You can't rest here for too long. You won't be able to get up at all. It's Phil. I'm coming, Phil. Parker? Katya, Katya! Come here! I saved a spot in the line! Come here, Katya! Valentina? Kate! Kate! Kate! Sonya! NEWSPAPER : LENINGRADSKAYA PRAVDA Kate Davis? Daily Telegraph. You -- you died in October. You died too, Korneyev. No, only wounded. Katinka, my God! Then all this time you were... Get in the car. There is a flight to Moscow. You are coming with me. - But -- - Get in the car. - My -- - No,no,no. There's a flight. You come with me. Yeah? This is fantastic! I can't believe it! My house! Stop the car! - Katya, we have no time. - You've missed it. Stop the car. Stop now! Katya! Katya! Katya! Where are you going, Katya? I must get the children. What children, Katinka? You don't have children! Okay, okay, okay, okay. We'll get the children. But not now -- later! - Now we have to make the plane. - No. It won't wait for us! No. You don't understand. The children are not a hallucination, Korneyev. Maybe you are. Ah! Ah! Ah! Where is the Major? He fell in! The driver's with him! Give me your hand! Your hand! Hang in there! Come on! Are you sure you aren't mistaken? Here, have a smoke. Comrade Commissar, I used to be smitten with her. Gonzales, Ekaterina Garcievna. I saw her ID. It even has an address in it. She's staying with the actress Vozdvizhenskaya. I tried to bring her, but she went on and on about some children. All right, you can go now. - I'm ready to fly right now. - What? Where? To Leningrad. We'd better get her out or she'll die. I'll take care of it. Go now. Thanks for the tip. Damn it! Korneyev! Comrade! Comrade! My coupons! Stop! Comrade, stop! Stop! Stop! If a person has nothing to eat except a tiny piece of bread, he suffers severely, at first. But after a while, the pain becomes dull and turns into listless indifference. Suddenly you find yourself surrounded by obstacles you can't overcome. The stairs are too steep to climb, the shelf too high to reach. Too far to bend down to draw the water from a hole in the ice, all you want to do is lie down. In Leningrad, when people say of someone "he lay down" or "she lay down", it means it's the end. The glue is flour-based but very old. Check. Yura, you think that it's time to die? Korneyev hasn't come. They probably shot down his plane. Planes always get shot down. It's my fault. Why? I gave Korneyev the wrong address. Anastassia's, downstairs. Anastassia Vozdvizhenskaya People's Artist False lead. I told you there was nobody here. We broke the door for nothing. It's not a false lead. It's not. I want to know everything about this actress. You understand? Her whole life story. Where she's from, who she was with -- all of it! Nina hasn't come, either. She must be dead. Otherwise she'd be here. If we fall asleep and leave the stove open, we'll die from the fumes. They say it's nice. It gives you sweet dreams. I guess Yura is right. It's time to die. Only it's a shame our food coupons will be wasted. There's got to be a store where they can be redeemed. They're stolen. Checkmate! Comrades, show your papers! Papers, please! I'm from the Ladoga group! Here. All right, you can go in. Remain calm! Take it easy! Ten trucks will be in the convoy, the first five with ammunition made in Kirovsky Factory. The rest will take those who are in need of evacuation the most, and also the families of the Ladoga skiers. Our way of thanking them. How many people, then? Major Tolkunov died. 8 out of 36 people returned. They will escort their families and then come back with food supplies. Good afternoon, sir. Well, I've dug out something interesting. Vozdvizhenskaya had a maid. She died recently. Her name was Valentina Tsvetkova. The maid had a daughter, Nina Tsvetkova, a cop. From the same precinct that ran the search for the Englishwoman. Easy, easy! Your documents, please. Please repeat, to whom do I connect you? Moscow. Newspaper Pravda. Senior correspondent Korneyev. The telegraph is only for the military. Hurry! I have orders! She's 20 minutes late. She'll be here, Sima, she'll come. First, we'll drive on ice. Will it be really slow? Depends on how much bombing. And then... they'll put us in an orphanage. Don't worry about that now, Sima. Let's just get ourselves out of here. Comrade Captain! May I be dismissed for a few minutes? Negative! We are about to line up! I need to get my family! Family? Aren't they here yet? They are close-by! What are you talking about, Tsvetkova? Comrade Zhdanov is about to make a speech! Everyone line up! We've got to leave -- today! Get up! We can't wait for Nina any longer. We're going. Just a little rest. No, Sima, we can't rest! We must -- We must leave! Here. Lean on here. Sima, get up! Get up, Sima! That's an order! We must leave! The suitcase. Forget the damn suitcase! Let's go! Let's head to the table, I have another idea. Yeah, lean on... Let me prop your legs, honey. All right. Over my shoulder. And... one... two... three! Parker? Korneyev! You're alive! You look the worse for wear. I hear you're leaving us? Huh! This war can speak for itself. It doesn't need me anymore. Maybe one more assignment -- I got word from Leningrad. The Road of Life has opened. First transports tomorrow. Huh! I can't even get out of this hotel! Nobody will give me papers to leave Moscow. You need to be there! Korneyev! Do it. Korneyev! Is the Captain here? No, sir, Comrade Major! And Tsvetkova? Tsvetkova? She was transferred out. Where to? How would I know, sir? When the Captain is back, he can tell you. Here. Come over here and rest for a moment before we go. Did I hurt you? Is your head all right? You told my mother she was killing me to save Sima. You knew about that? She had no choice, as you don't have one now. So, if you want to be kind, be like our mother. Take Sima, put her on the sled -- No! I won't leave you here. I can't. What can you do? Carry me down four floors? Yes. I'm staying, too. Sima. I'm staying. No, you are not staying! No one is staying! I promised you everything will be all right, and it will. Please, help Sima. And me -- take me back to the kitchen, by the stove. Nina! Take my Dasha with you. Get her to the other side! Leave her at an orphanage! Tell them that her mother died on the way! What? Zina died. She was giving all her food to Dasha. Will you take her? Come over here, Dasha. Come on. Go ahead. Your documents, please. That's my family. Go, Dasha. I'll see you soon. Give me your hand. Your documents, please. Papa! Sweetheart! You hold on! Hold on! We'll see each other soon. I promise. Go with Nina. Don't give up. It's my family! Katya! - Katya! - Nina! Nina! Well, here we are. Ladoga. Convoy, stop! Drop the sides! Hurry! Hurry! Where is the convoy now? Get to them immediately! So we get to them, then what? Check each and every one of them? Tomorrow she'll turn up at the British Embassy! And that's it! We've lost her! Well, then we've lost her. The real enemies are closing in on Moscow, strangling Leningrad. But no, we, as usual, go on fighting our own enemies! Well, there it is, we lost her. Permission to leave. THE ENEMY WILL BE STOPPED! Check the cars! What's taking you so long? Hurry, hurry! WE'LL DEFEND BELOVED LENINGRAD! THE LENINGRAD FRONT ICE ROAD -- 30 km I'll talk to Parker, and we'll be waiting here when you get back. When who gets back? You and Yura. You'll go back to Leningrad for him and pick him up. Katya, the reward was to escort my family. I have to get back to my precinct. They won't let me out again. - Then... just send Yura. - Impossible. The waiting list to get out -- Yura is not special enough even to get on it. There must be some way. Go, Katya. Go, and don't worry about Yura. He'll be with me. Um, some meat, bread, medicine. We even dug up a bottle of whiskey. Thank you. Take the horses away from the cars! Kate. It's time. Go. Go, Katya. Tsvetkova, you snooze, you lose! I'm coming, Comrade Captain! Wrap it up! Kate, get in. As soon as we get this thing fired up, we're out of here. You know there are... Come on, let's go! Phil, pay attention, will you? Try it again! Okay, Finley, come on, let's get out of here! Sima, Phil is a very good man. Are we going to Moscow with him? And you are going back with Tsvetkova? To Yura. I knew it. Start the engines! Let's go! Go! Phil, where is she going? Nina! Wait! Stop! - Where the hell is she going? - Nina, hold on, please! Please, stop! Stop! Kate! Kate! LENINGRAD, 1965 They evacuated out of Siberia. I stayed after the war and went to ballet school. Now I am prima at the local dance theatre. - It's not Langley, but it is good. - Excellent ! Sima! Sima! Hello. I stopped at Anastassia's. She said you left already. Hello. You must be Phil Parker. Da. Parker. I'm Yura Krasko. Well, shall we get a drink, in memory of our loved ones? Let's go. You may not remember, you sent me a bottle of whiskey in 1941. And ever since then, I've gradually grown a taste for good stuff. Come on, get in! GONZALES, EKATERINA GARCIEVNA. 1915-1943 Here. And here. TSVETKOVA, NINA KONSTANTINOVNA. 1915-1943 The siege of Leningrad lasted 882 days. Nearly 1,500,000 people died. By January 24, 1944, Leningrad was completely liberated by the Soviet army.
