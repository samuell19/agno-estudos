THE INVISIBLE ARMY Goodbye. Excuse me, do you have a match? Pigs... Pigs... WELL-KNOWN WHOLESALER MURDERED Another one has been shot. Member of the Chamber of Commerce. - What was his name? - Viktor Emilius Sørensen. - Where are my gloves? - He shot him down from behind. He can't have been that well known or your dad would have known him. It is so awful. I just saw them! - Every day, and just a small paragraph. - It's so strange. - Have you looked in the hall? - Yes, I have. - They were not in the drawer? - Yes! Impossible! But where are my glasses? I must have them with me. - Aren't they in the bag? - Where did I put them? You confuse yourself, Mom. - When are you leaving? - When the car arrives. But the cars aren't reliable either any more. Everything just floats along. It's like life in Russia. What would you know about that? There are other things to think about than fun. But you would fit right in. The further away from old values, the better. Huh? - You don't understand me? - No. You socialize a bit much with others for a married woman. What are you talking about? - What are you doing tonight? - Nothing. - I'm guessing you have a visitor. - I have no idea. Why? I've been told you're receiving visitors in my home. - Who told you that? - Anna Oxholm saw you. - You were out dancing. - But that was with Jørgen! - Yes, which is why I deny it as gossip. - It's nonsense. Oh, but the nonsensical thing is that you're not taking this chance. You should get your relationship legalized! You seemed to recall I'm married. You haven't seen Poul in years, and if a man stays in England despite a looming war, then he has no right to make demands. Should I divorce Poul? You're mad. Am I not allowed to drink tea with an old friend, without... And Jørgen is Poul's best friend! And in every way a better match. I always wanted you to choose him. But it takes a World War for you to realize that I'm right. There is nothing between Jørgen and me. Well, it can't go on this way! Oh, there it is. Goodbye. Have a nice evening. - Alice, my love. - Did she see you? - No. She was late, huh? - Yes. - Something's wrong? - No. - I've missed you. - Are you sure she didn't see you? We have to be more careful, if we want to see each other. If? Kiss me, darling. I have a present for you. A very small one. - You must not buy things for me. - But there IS something wrong? Something wrong? No more than what has always been wrong. That I'm not in love with you. So you cannot give me things. And I've never said that I was. No, I've probably been in love for the both of us. - We've been seen together. - But nothing's wrong with that. But people think there is. Mom too. So it can't go on. I'm married. And I love him. What if he finds out? So we can't see each other any more? There's no one I can talk to like you. You're the only one I can talk to about Poul. I want us to see each other. But nothing more. - But people will assume there's more. - But there won't be! Doesn't it also feel cheap to you to see someone who is in love with your best friend? Who might be seeing you out of boredom? Perhaps I hoped that it could be me you would love. And you would be with the man who loved you more than anyone. - That's my excuse. - But I have no excuse. I love him. It's only because I've been missing him all these years that everything happened. Then my love must be the excuse for both of us. I think it's almost big enough for that. Thank you, Jørgen. It's so pretty. But you must not... And it's war. People die. And suffer. And we're just here. Others risk their lives. And we're just having fun. Can't you see it's petty? - You never asked for war. - We're still not allowed to... I get desperate from not doing anything. - But what to do? - Is Poul doing nothing? No, we know that. I wish I was involved as well. I wouldn't have such a guilty conscience about us. Why don't you answer? Am I wrong? Let's go to my room. Hurry! There they are. To think they're sitting all the way up there... It's a damned lovely sound. How do we get away, when there's an alarm? Right on! Halt! I don't like you living here. It's way too dangerous. What if something happened to you. Would you be sad? Look at my pretty scarf. Stay. - Who is it? - Alice... - Poul. - Alice. Jørgen. I didn't want to come here, but they have the neighborhood surrounded. Are they after you? It was the only way. I've been here a couple months. Nobody knows where I am. If they come here, I forced you. I'll make sure it looks that way. I've been thinking of seeing you Jørgen. For a different reason, at your office. (In German) Open the door, immediately! House search! If they come, they'll be here in a minute. Jørgen stays seated. You open the door. Turn on the light in the hall so they can see Jørgen's coat. You deny anyone's here. You're a couple in love. - How do I keep them from coming in? - You don't. - I'll try the patio. - May I smoke? Yes. And stay out there, so I don't hit you. - Are you going to shoot? - "Am I going to shoot?" You think this is a game? A moment ago, they shot a friend of mine. We know what will happen to him, if he doesn't die. Open it immediately. (In German) Open up! - House search. - What's happened? - Has anyone come by here? - Anyone here? No, no one. You can look. Who's that? My fiancé. He's been here all evening. My mother comes in half an hour. Whom are you looking for? - His coat? - Yes. - So, the truth? - No one has come here. We'll search the entire house. - Found anything? - No. Pardon us. - Well, here we are again. - Give me something to drink. Alice, you were great. - It's over now. - Let me sit awhile. We need a glass, all three of us. Miss, I have an important call to 6210. Thanks. Yes it's me. Thanks, quite well. But Ewald got sick. They had to take him to the hospital. Stomachache. We'll drink morning coffee at Ole's. You have to find a buyer for the cucumbers. Yes, goodbye. Cheers, Alice. You handled that well. - It's so good to see you again. - It's good to see you too. - I will leave you two alone. - Stay awhile, Jørgen. No, you should be alone. Goodbye. - We'll meet soon. Call. - Yes. It was as if it bothered him a bit. Beloved. - Have you missed me a little? - Yes. - Just a little? - I've missed you very much. - Where's your mom? - She's on her way to a party. Let's go to your room. Oh, the light. It's late. Mom must not see you... No, God forbid. Ah, it's so good to lie here. Lie here with me. You have to leave. She's come home early before. Aren't you happy to see me? - You know I am. - Then I'll stay a while. - But you said earlier you couldn't. - Because of your mom? You'll get her out of the way when I have to leave. I'm here to see you. It's been four years. - You've changed a bit. - No, I've missed you. I've been thinking about you every day and been proud of you. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I don't understand... What don't you understand? How you can feel like this after what happened yesterday. One of your friends got shot. I can't do anything for him right now. Did you see him fall? Yes. He fell forward, rolled on to his back and held his stomach. He grit his teeth together. You quickly grasp this stuff. And then you could sleep next to me this way. - I don't understand. - Why not? - Don't you feel a thing? - Feel? Feel... I try to do things! I'll help him if I can. There'd be no feelings if the same thing happened to me. Darling, be sensible. - Good Morning. - Good Morning, Madam. Is my daughter awake? She had the tea brought up half an hour ago. Alice! - Ah, mother-in-law. - She's coming up! Good you got the practice. She's more dangerous than 6,000 gestapo's. Alice? I'll be there. I haven't gotten out of bed yet. Why have you locked the door? They shot, and I was all alone. You were? That is too bad. - There was nobody else? - Jørgen dropped by. That was nice of him. I'm glad you have him, he's been... How have you been, Mom? Go on, I'll be there in a second. I've been sitting in a bomb shelter with the must awful people. My throat is sore! This war has to end soon. Nobody can say we're not doing our part. To think, to be so close to her and yet not be able to close my arms around her... I'll go see her, while you get dressed. - So, how have you been? - I slept at Gudrun's. - Anything wrong? - With me? Or with me? I return home and find half empty glasses. You don't drink from two glasses. And your door is locked. Wasn't that a subject I broached yesterday, and which you denied? - You didn't expect a visit. - I had no idea Jørgen would drop by. I was glad he did. There were shots and patrols all around. And then you locked yourself in your room. - You know how it is to be alone... - You must think I'm stupid, my girl. You were so scared that Jørgen had to stay with you. He is with you now. Both you and Jørgen know me. You know my broad-mindedness. - It's not true. - You're mocking me! I don't think Jørgen wants that. I get home and surprise my married daughter with a man in her room. I demand you get your relationship in order. - What do you want ordered? - You don't understand me? - No! - So, you want to go on like this? You misunderstand everything. You're seeing things. I'm seeing things?! Then I'll talk to him myself. - Jørgen will understand me. - Mom, you mustn't. - It's not Jørgen - What?! Then who is it? - I can't tell. - Let me get by! Don't tell anyone. It's Poul. Poul? But he's... Is he here? Don't tell anyone! He must not know that you know. He'll destroy us! Why is he here? There are other countries to sabotage. - Don't tell anyone. - Me?! He can never come here again. He won't. Typical of him! Completely irresponsible. So, did you handle it? What did she say? - What happened? Are you nervous? - No. - Alice... - I'm afraid of what will happen. - Everything is going to be okay. I'll send you a message one way or another. - I have to see you again soon. - Be careful. Bye. - Where is this going? - You'll know. Just be ready. Hello. Hello. So. They got Ewald. We don't know how bad it is, but it looked pretty bad. - Have you gotten the stuff? - It's nearly done. What about you? Then drive over to Emil. Leave it in the yard. We'll stay away from here the rest of the day. Leave the trucks. We can't stay here any longer. Ewald knew this place, and he knew where I lived. So far, he can't have said anything. Well... Mathematically, there's a chance... Mathematically there's a chance you could get a roof tile on your head! I saw him fall. You sense how severely a man is wounded. They need to bring him back to consciousness first. Everything shall be kept ready, as if nothing has happened. Fourteen days ago, we lost Johannes. Yesterday Ewald. I only took charge when they took Johannes. And yesterday was a coincidence. New complications keep popping up. They've built machine-gun nests. And they are planning to add new alarm systems. Well, isn't the time for action right now? If only we had the blueprints. You said you could get them. Yes yes, but I don't think there's time to focus on that. There are much more serious things. I've had the war in my house. No, I can't. No, much worse. Not a word I say! No, something completely different... No! But we could have tea together? Hello. Nielsen. Ole Nielsen. Where's your telephone, Jørgen? Thanks. - Make yourself at home. - Thanks, it's so uncomfortable. - You're a friend of Henrik's. - Henrik? Oh yes, you know his real name. - You're his best friend. - We've been friends for many years. Yeah, we call him Henrik. He is a great guy. He joined us when our leader got taken. Even though it's not his job. He's from England. - Did you know Ewald? - No, who is that? He's the one we lost yesterday. He had guts as well. - Is he dead? - That's what we don't know. - Have you heard anything? - They'll call back here. - We have to wait. - I'll go get a drink. - I'm starving - Jørgen, do you have any food? - I've just sent the girl away. - Don't you have anything? Yes, but it won't be as nice. - No problem, Ole will fix it. - Who cares about "nice". This is the way to the fridge, huh? - No, thanks - Ah, a few drops. Thanks for letting us drop by. You're not happy to see me either? Why wouldn't I be happy? Was Alice not happy? - Can I have a beer? - Yes. An opener? I'll fix it with my tooth. Cheers. I don't know. I guess she was. - Well, yes, but then what? - Then what? It's just a feeling. I've imagined a lot of things. Perhaps it's me... who's changed. Of course Alice is happy to see you. She's missed you. It was as if I didn't recognize her. - It was the shock. - Yes, perhaps. Cheers. Remember when we were both in love with her? Yes. Remember when we were camping in Sweden? That girl we met there, both of us liked her as well. The whole hotel awoke when she returned at night. This is the stuff. Real sardines. - You can open a new can. - That's swell, my friend. - I call all of Henrik's friends my own. - Yes, of course. It's strange it's not much longer ago. That it happened in my lifetime. And with me. We've thought of you a lot. Thoughts aren't enough. You've been at home. You've had each other. It hasn't always been that pleasant here. It's been hell being away. You should have been there to see your own country surrender... We took it rather calmly. But they fought. They understood that those people had to be fought. - They fight for what they believe in. - Do you believe that as well? - God no! - Then who cares what they believe? - They are human. - Human... They're psychopaths! They make the world intolerable. They make this country intolerable. They fight for what they believe in, and we just believe something different. The factories work and the corn grows. For whom? The workers have to work, they have wives and children. Should they be unemployed and see their children starve? If one leaves, another takes his place. It's because of that logic that thousands are killed. It's what the cowards cower behind. It's what the greedy say to excuse their profit. It's mental collaboration. Sorry, I didn't mean a word of it. - You have nothing to be sorry for. - It must be the nerves. I've looked forward to seeing you, and then I get nasty. We're nervous, both of us, I think. We argue, though we agree. Maybe both of us feel bad as well. You, because of the things you do. Me, because I don't. And we explain it away. But you're closer to your good conscience than I am. There's a part of me that I can't find. If I have to be a stranger to you, I'll lose it completely. - Alice has missed you. - I've missed her. But I return home, and perhaps it has been destroyed by the war. I've tried to hurt them, but perhaps they've hurt me more than I them. - This is a great apartment. - Yes. I'm pleased that you like it. Yes, what a location. And what rooms. What a hall. An iron bar for the door. And then a hand grenade, when they come through. And afterwards, you could take them from here. Is the roof flat? Do you have a ladder? - No. - There's no ladder here? Well, yes, on the kitchen stairs. Perhaps you can get up and down again somewhere else. - We're not going to live here. - But it's nice for him to know! That's the type of guy we need. They're worth more than ten politicians. I don't get why the telephone isn't ringing. Was it your company, that built "Metrodan"? - Yes. - So you have the blueprints? Yes, models and blueprints. Are you planning to sabotage Metrodan? It's part of the war industry. It's what I'm here for. And it's the factory they're guarding the most. They've just ordered new security measures. - From you? - We've done our best not to help. They've begun work on it themselves. - Could you show us that model? - No, it's at the studio. I've thought of asking you to do it. It's necessary. - We could go there tonight. - With complete strangers. - There's a night guard. - I see. It's not that I don't want to help. - Can't you see that it's awkward? - Yes. How would it happen? You would simply let us in. - And the night guard? - There's lots of guards at Metrodan. And they're armed. They are the ones we are trying to avoid. But this one is a good man. Nothing must happen to him. All the better. Of course you will show us, right, Jørgen? Yes. Do you know who it is? No... but it must be someone who knows me. They said at the studio that you were at home. Poul is here. We have to go to him. I'll say I told you that he'd be here. Poul, it's Alice. I told her that we were going to meet here. Just a second. It's not a real roof, it's flat. It's great! I went up the kitchen stairs. You can come down in a completely different street. - Løvenørn... Kai Løvenørn. - This is Alice. - Where do you come down? - In Ejvindsgade. Come. - Nonsense - It's for his own sake. Yes... definitely... Up on the chair and this way. Can you be seen on the roof? We'll pretend we're looking at an antenna. Did you miss me too much? We can't be seen together - Why are you here? - No reason. Come and see. Pretend you're examining it. That woman is looking at us. Don't stare! Look at that chimney. There's a trapdoor to the kitchen stairs. And in the backyard, there's a gate that leads to Ejvindsgade. - I see. - Yes. We could also try the other roof. - Perhaps there's an even better way! - Oh no, this is fine. A lot of people would be thankful for this kind of trick. People can do what they want, but there has to be a limit. - What are you getting Jørgen into? - Nothing. - He could be hurt. - It's completely safe. Yes, it's me. And it happened before he got there? Thanks. Bye. Promise me you won't get him mixed up in anything. And what about the rest of us? Don't you think something could happen to us? And yet we get ourselves mixed up in it. You're different. You know how to do things. He's no good for that kind of thing. You care a lot about Jørgen? He has been so good to me. I missed you so much. Nothing will happen to Jørgen. It's safe. They just called. Ewald was dead when they got him there. - Oh. - So it's safe to continue. I'll call you about that thing tonight. We must be careful, take no chances. We'd better leave. It's best you don't leave with us. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Don't walk us out. Well, you've gotten your wish. You're involved the way you wanted. - Are you leaving? - Yes. Jørgen, be careful. I don't matter. I can do this better than others. - Don't say things like that. - Don't you care about Poul? Yes. But you must not get involved in anything. Why would you do so? It's nothing. Otherwise, they wouldn't use me for it. I can do a small thing to make things easier for those who have to do a lot. Hey, you owe me a cigarette. Have you heard that thing about Eva's cousin? The one in England? - It's the entrance across the street. - Sure. - 3781, if anything happens. - Yes. It's brilliant. It's like flying in an airplane. - Yes, it's that one. - I know, I've been there. This is the road, and this is where you'll enter. This is the gate with the guard and the doorman. From the gate, the road leads to the quay and to the power station right here. Oh yes, now you can see it. You'll drive to here, stop, and unload. Has anything changed? There used to be only one guard outside. Now there are machine-gun nests in the square. Where are they? As precisely as possible. Here and here. There's sandbags, and usually a couple of men at each one. We'll take care of one from car number 1, which we'll park here, so that this nest can't see the other one. You'll be at the gate with car number 2. Can you take care of the other from there? - How long is the distance? - You know that, Jørgen. - About 100 meters. - Yes, it can be done. The night guard. - Oh, it's you Mr Nielsen. - You're here late. Yes, I'm working. That makes two of us. Were you frightened? - Oh no. There's nothing wrong. - Goodnight, then. It has to be quick. From arrival till it's over, it can't take more than five minutes. Otherwise it won't be completely silent... I made him leave. He suspected nothing. At 16.40, I'll walk through the gate with the papers of a police detective. They'll make a phone call to check. It'll check out. I'll be searched, and I'll walk this way to the office. And here is the worker with a gun for me. I'll force the director to allow our cars to pass through and to receive the box with the new part for the machine... Yes. The neighborhood will be guarded by our people from 16.30. We'll be ready at the garage at 15. We'll start at 16. At 16.30, we'll be at the corner of Nygaards Allé og Toksværdsvej. The cars from Metrodan should be on the way, and we'll follow them, and be right behind them when we reach the factory. I'll drive with the first car to the power station and will be ready to take care of the machine-gun nest. And you'll stop at the gates and wait for us, ready to take care of the position here. You forgot something. What happens after we've placed the explosives? - Out, as fast as we can! - No, you forgot something else. I'll warn you with a long and a short toot. - We won't be so cocky tomorrow. - We won't forget you tomorrow, Henrik. Are you in charge of the security out there? Yes. So you have access to the factory. We don't want any more people involved. Are we ready? Yes. And to think there are people who go to the movies for excitement. - How much do you use? - 300 kg, all in all. Then they won't be making a toy gun the next fortnight. This is an essential factory for the Germans. They make tracks for tanks and controls for V1s. And they make one person submarines. It will take at least six months to get production back up and running. Shall we say good night? Henrik, you'll be sitting 20 meters from the 300 kg. Don't get too comfortable in the chairs, even if he offers you a drink. Do any of these need a little bang? What about the tall one right there? That's the acid factory. Do you want to see it blow? Boom... No. I like to build houses, not destroy them. He's been here for a while. Pyller told me. She knows a friend of Alice's mother. - Poul Andersen? Did he parachute in? - Who is he? So. English agent, where? You know, yes? You don't know, no? I know the name of a lady who has talked about it. Klara Rye, Ivar Huitfeldsgade 30. - Phone? - Palæ 7014. Have this number put under surveillance immediately. Yes, Commissioner. Surveillance, right away. - And also, there's this thing... - All right, all right. Goodbye. I don't get why Harald never makes up his own bed. If only I could sleep in my own bed tonight! It's a message from the boss. He wants to talk to you. - Why? Everything is okay. - He wants more information. - Okay, I'll call him. - Otherwise, everything looks fine. Nothing for me to see here. Goodbye, gentlemen. ALICE ANDERSEN MARRIED; POUL ANDERSEN Come in. Pass this on to Sturmbannführer Biegel. (Major in the SS) Oh boy! I should take double rate for this. But I have to go there. We're going to study after school. But last time you weren't even there. You're acting so strangely. Girls, obviously. I demand you focus on school. - Surely you're not running after girls? - No, Mom. - No, Georg is not like that. - No, but I can't sit here all the time! - But Georg! - What is it you're doing? Stay out of it, Dad. You wouldn't know! You're going nowhere! Or we'll send you to boarding school! It should be possible to send your parents to boarding school... - Is it visible? - No. - Am I interrupting, Dad? - No, it's just for this Sunday. God bless you, my boy. - Are you scared? - Yes. Every time. Goodbye, my boy. A. SORENSEN, VICAR “And the Lord has said: Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends.” - Just a moment. - Thanks. Hello, Jørgen. I have to borrow the blueprint you had yesterday. - Now? - Yes. - But there are people inside - It's very important. I'll leave them for you at the shop afterwards. - Thanks. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Come on, boys. - Ready? - Yes. Get the P2s. Careful now. - That's what I call a sweep! - Please, let me. Yeah, you got it. - Good day. - Good day. - Do you have second thoughts? - I'd like to be more informed. It's not just me, it's the entire police force. - It should hopefully go well. - Everything's fine. I just need access to the factory, and I'll have that as a detective sent by you. If they don't make a phone call to check, you won't even get involved. But they will. That's for certain. You already have papers saying you're a police detective. And I need to confirm your identity if someone calls me. If I agree, I'll send an officer to Metrodan at 16. He will be at the corner of Christiansvej and Pilevænget... Slowly, on bike, fifteen minutes later... And you'll make sure he is... held up... You need to be firm. And be there on time. He can't very well wait for you. Yes... That's good. Yes. Finish eating, guys, so we can get started. - That'll be 10 øre, Mister. - Yes... I need to send something. 1281. Yes, it's me. Can you meet me now? Hello? Hello? Can you meet me now? It's very important. Svendborggade 18, 2nd floor. It says "Jensen" on the door. Message from phone surveillance. - She's being followed, right? - Yes, yes. Svendborggade. There's something I have to ask you. I'm in a rush. You can give it back to him. It's his. I longed for you. I think that's why it happened. So I'm nothing but... a fool. - What have I been doing?! - Poul... What's it all for? I thought I was doing something. Something to be proud of. Something with freedom and fresh air. Something for everyone. And what do people want? A bit of fun and a bed for whoring. And for that I've been acting the fool! Let them stay in the mud that they've chosen to roll around in. Let them be pushed down in it by the others. They aren't any worse. I'll stop it. I'll call. I can't do it. I've thought of you for four years. You were a part of it. It was like that for me too. It changed when you came back. Then you realized it was Jørgen you really loved. The one person I trusted the most, like I trust my self. I was happy he was there for you. God damn! I'm cornered. How have they... Damn... The corner of Nygaards Allé and Toksværdsvej, remember. I'll take the back stairs, when you hear shots, you try the main stairs. Contact Jørgen. Two trucks need to be warned, at the corner of Nygaards Allé and Toksværdsvej. I'm sorry. - It's on. - Then take it off again. Poul's been shot. We need to warn somebody at Nygaards Allé and Toksværdsve. Is he... He asked me to meet him. He'd found out about us. - Can't they do it now? - No. So it was... because he knew? He sensed that I'd changed. Everything had become so different. - Alice... - I don't understand it. Was that why you came to my apartment yesterday? Yes. - Did you see when he...? - Yes. And this was our big opportunity! Just as it was about to go down. It was his idea. His work. Those pigs! As you know... I can get access to the factory. If you trust me, I could do it. I'll do my best. He won't even be handed the gun inside. But I won't be searched. The director knows me. I could carry one. Do you remember everything? There's two more trucks... I remember everything. They've taken some of us out. Ewald two days ago, today Henrik. Should we give them an uppercut in return? Should we show them there's still a lot of us? Okay, tell the others. We'll get ready. - Do you have a gun? - No. - Take this. - Isn't it too big? The guy needs to see that it can kill. You'll stick it right in his face. - Do I just have to pull? - It's ready. Pull there. He'll come with you. He'll see if you can get inside. If it's necessary, shoot. Shoot to kill! Then they'll remember for next time. The signal from the car is one long and one short. Then you have to come down. One long and one short. Yes. - I don't know you, but if you... - Don't worry. I love you, Jørgen. I want you to know, before... You know how I've always felt about you. Come on, pal. Good day. Will you tell the director I'm here? Sure, come on in. Yes. It's okay. Go inside. Come on in! Good day. Please take a seat. So, what's this about? By the way, how's your dad? He's been convalescing for a while. It was the kidneys. But now... Are you insane? Is this a joke? We must be careful. Don't be fooled by my nervousness. I may shoot before it's needed, if I get nervous. - Don't move at all. - You're mad. Come to your senses. I'll shoot if you don't do what I tell you to. You're waiting for a convoy of trucks to arrive at the factory. You must tell them that it's been increased by two trucks. - And those trucks must be let in. - Never! Listen... The first truck drives to the power-station with a big box. You'll say it's a part for the machine, and that it should be let through at once. You must give all necessary instructions for your own sake. If the people on those trucks are stopped, I'll shoot. Reconsider. It's because we work for the Germans? But if we didn't, others would. I don't have any sympathy for our guests, either. They're people too. They fight for their ideas. We create jobs for a hundred people. They will become unemployed. If you don't give the instructions, I'll have to shoot. I'll count to three. One. Two. Wait. Yes... Yes, sir. Hello? It's cleared. Come on through. Him too. - What's wrong? - This stupid car has stopped. This was risky to begin with, and now it's bad. In a second, he'll shoot himself in the leg. - What part is this? - Who cares. But I'd wish it was a bomb that could blow this whole thing up. Get inside. - We can get it to there. - No, it's better here. When are we leaving? We can't be here when it blows up. It's murder! Everyone get out of here. In three minutes, it'll all blow up. Get going. Now! Stay put. Alarm signal. - He hasn't come down yet. - Honk, God dammit. There goes Metrodan.
