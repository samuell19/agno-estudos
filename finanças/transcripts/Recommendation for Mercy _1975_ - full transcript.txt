(birds chirping) (bush rustling) (ominous music) (gunshot fires) (upbeat lively music) (birds chirping) (bike wheels spinning) (John groaning) (metal clanging) (upbeat music) [Frank] Full of shit, I mean here you are supposed to be one of the big heels around school, and you tell us you've never been laid? Hey, Frank, you sure, huh? I mean, you've really done it? What? Fucked a girl? Yeah. Sure I have. Listen, don't forget I'm the world's greatest hypnotist, which gives me advantage over you poor slobs. If I really want a girl, all I have to do is catch her eye. You're early. I told Mrs. Johnson, my parents wanted me home early. Just wanted to leave already. What's the matter? Nothing. Well, are you gonna take me for a ride? Sure. (car engine revving) ♪ Now the memory's still there ♪ (bird squawking) ♪ Sunlight streaming through far and through ♪ I'm going to prove to you mere mortals that even Brucey here can learn the trick. I'll teach you through hypnosis since you're probably too stupid to learn any other. (John laughing) Close your eyes. That's right, close them. Empty your mind. Float in the air like a feather. (John laughing) Drifting. Come on Frank, it don't feel any different. Silence. The master commands it. Close your eyes. You're drifting, (kick thudding) Floating in the air like a feather. Falling. Falling. Falling. And now, (kick thudding) We're going to learn how to feel a great sensation. (Bruce screaming) (romantic music) Could hardly believe it, you should have seen him. He just stood there. Can't you just see it? There he is with his eyes closed standing right at the edge. Deserved it for being so stupid. I'm telling him, "You're falling, falling. Come on, watch the movie, Frank. [Frank] Hey, Nora. - [Anne] What? - Give John a kiss? You crazy? No. Hey John, wanna feel? Bugger off. Shh. Okay, now him. Come on, I'm not kidding, do it. Nora, kiss him. Shh! Not bad, eh? (telephone ringing) Hello. Hi John, this is Nora. [John] Oh, hi Nora. - How are you? - Oh, fine. I was wondering, well, you know the Lennon's place, eh? Sure. Well, his cows are calving and it's really neat to see the calves, I mean, when they're just born. [John] Yeah. So would you like to go over with me and see 'em, say Wednesday night after supper? No, no, I couldn't then. You see, we've gotta practice for a track meet. I've really gotta be there. Oh, it wouldn't hurt to miss one, would it? You always win anyway. Well, I really should go. Now, John Robinson don't you play hard to get. Seven o'clock and don't be late. No, Nora, I'm serious. I'm not sure if I can make it. [Nora] How come? [John] Yeah. Actually- - [Frank] Come on, give it to me. [John]...kind of planning something else. [Frank] Prick. Oh wow. Wow, can you see? [John] Come on Frank, give me. Come on. (clock chiming) [Nora] John? John, are you there? Yeah, yeah, sure Nora. Look, I'll see you tomorrow at school. We'll talk about it then. (camera clicking) (Bruce gasping) (John panting) Come on, Frank, come on. You got no business with it. Give it here, it's mine. [Frank] Hoo wee! [Bruce] Frank, you bastard, give me it. [Frank] Wow, look at those tits. Where'd you get this stuff Brucey? You steal it from your father? Nevermind where I gotta it, just hand it over. Gee, Brucey, think a growing boy like you should be looking at stuff like this? I had it hid you prick. You've been going through my stuff. Stuff like this just ain't no good for a growing boy like you. I think I better rip it up. Bastard! Bastard! Come on fat boy, let's see you throw a rock. Want your dirty pictures back? Huh? (punches landing) - [Bruce] Stop, stop. - (Bruce groaning) You little prick. Stop Frank. (Bruce grunting) Stop! Help, help! Stop! (Bruce groaning) Help, help! Stop! Get off him. You're supposed to be my friend. You just stood there and watch. Brucey, I just got here. I just got here, too late to do anything. Brucey. Bastards, just wait. - Brucey. - Just wait and see. He thinks I just stood here and let you do that to him. What do you care what that little fart thinks? Oh yeah, you're really big with the little guys, eh? Any time big mouth. Yeah, you wait. Brucey! Brucey! (gentle chime music) (both giggling) (gears winding) Fran, John really likes you lot, doesn't he? Yeah, I guess so. Do you like him? He's all right, I suppose. What do you mean "He's all right, you suppose?” Well, he's a nice guy and all that, but that's it. Fran, you still a Virgin? What do you wanna know that for? Just curious. Maybe, maybe not. Are you? Maybe, maybe not. (both giggling) Did you or didn't you? Yeah. What was it like? Was it fun? Yeah. (both laughing) What about you? Oh yeah, I did. Well, did you like it? Sure, it was great. (both laughing) (gentle chime music) Hi John. Well, today's the day. It's Thursday, remember you said you'd go with me to the Lennon's place. Well look Nora, I forgot. I can't go, honest. You know, if you think you're gonna go somewhere with Fran, you can just forget it. You don't have to look so surprised, I'm not stupid, you know? Anyway, she's got a boyfriend, so you just forget it. He's not really her boyfriend. She just drives around in his car once in a while. Huh, so I was right. Well, she's probably out with him tonight. So you're stuck with me. (horseshoe clanging) What about, Frank? We broke up. Beside he doesn't care anyway. Yeah, that's what he says. Scared? No. Why should I be scared of Frank? [Nora] You better just stop playing hard to get. I just might give up trying. [John] Come on, Nora. Get off. [Nora] Come on John, let go, come on. Promise to stop fooling, then? Yeah, come on. Come on, promise. Okay, okay, I promise. You sure, huh? Yeah. (John laughs) (romantic music) [Nora] See you at Lennon's bush, after supper. Bye John. - Hit her. - I'll hit her. Yay, that's okay. Come on, let's go. Come on hurry, hurry up. - [Kid] You hit her? - [Kid 2] Yeah, she did. Come on hit it. Hit the ball. Catch it, catch it. (owl hooting) (kids chattering) (upbeat music) [Kid] Hit her. [John] Hi. [Fran] Hi John. [John] Hi. [Fran] You wanna go through the ponies? Sure. [Kid] Hit her. [Nora] Hey George. [George] Yeah? [Nora] George, have you seen John? [George] What do you wanna know for? [Nora] I said, have you seen him? [George] Nah. Have you seen him? Nah, he hasn't been here since I came. [George] Hey, what's the matter Nora get stood up? What's the matter Nora get stood up? What's the matter Nora get stood up? What's the matter Nora get stood up? Hurry home, Billy. (birds chirping) (water splashing) Johnny, are you up there? John! (gun shot fires) (suspenseful music) [Vic] Hey! (car engine revs) (calm music) Come in son. Your name is John Robinson. - Yes, sir. - Sit down here, John. This is Sergeant Henderson. John, we're hoping you can explain a few things for us. You mean about Fran Bailey? That's right, John. We came down here today to talk to some of the kids here to see if they could help us. We're trying to figure out where she might have gone last night. Now some of them seem to think that you might have seen her. Is there anything you can tell us that might help? Well, yeah, I saw Fran last night. I gave her a drive up to the highway. Where'd you meet her John? Right here at the school. [Vic] And then where did you go? Now, try to remember exactly. Well, we both got on my bike and we went all the way up the road here to Highway number nine, that's all. [Vic] Why'd she wanna go up there? Is she tending? Well, yeah, she said she wanted to see the ponies. Now let's see now, that road goes past a farm, the Lennon farm, I believe, then passed some woods in the property and further on crosses the bridge and right onto the highway. Yeah, that's right. [Henderson] Did you stop anywhere on the way? No, she was in a hurry. [Vic] Did you see Fran Bailey? No, but- - [Vic] Did you see John Robinson? Yes, sir. [Vic] Where did you see John? He was on his bike past the bridge, going to Highway 9. Where exactly? I saw on her the crossbar John's bike, past the bridge, going up to Highway number 9. (dramatic music) (dog barking) (indistinct chatter) That scrub. I got it, I got it! (dogs barking) (indistinct chatter) (dramatic music) Frank, wait for me! (helicopter whirring) Where do you want that helicopter to come down? Tell him to put it on the bald spot, on top of that hill up there. (indistinct chatter) Over here! Over here! She's been found, over here! There she is, over here! Over here! Over here! Over here! Over here! Over here! (helicopter whirring) Over here! Over here, she's been found. My God. [Search Member] Oh my God. (suspenseful music) [Priest] Now the sweet child's life is over. Now the foreign days are passed. (engine roaring) And prevail to long the peace. Christ the Lord shall guard her well. He who died for her sins. [All] Earth to earth and dust to dust. Calmly now the words we say, left behind we wait in trust for the resurrection day. The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. [Congregation] The Lord is my shepherd I shall want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. (dramatic music) [Congregation] He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. [Congregation] He leadeth me beside the still waters. [Priest] He restoreth my soul. [Congregation] He restoreth my soul. [Priest] He leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his name sake. [Congregation] He leadeth me in the path of righteousness, for his name sake.

[Priest] Dearly beloved Francesca Bailey. Therefore commit her- - [Cameraman] Turn to the right. Hold it. [Priest] Earth to Earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Assurance certain hope of resurrection to eternal life of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. (somber music) (typer clicking) Obvious scratch and burn marks to the right and left knee in the vertical direction. Superficial puncturing. Apparently some sort of brush burns fairly well healed over, therefore no less than two days old, maybe three. Scratches of about the same age to the palms of both hands. Similar scratches and burn marks to the underside of the forearms. Step down, son. Recent cut to the left shoulder. Again the state of healing estimated at two or three days. Just relax, son. Redning to both sides of the penis. Quite sore. Degree of swelling. Laceration about one inch in length, along the left side of the shaft. No bleeding. Scab recently formed. Again, same age as other wounds. Approximately three days. [Vic] You were on your bike to the highway and that was the last you saw her. [John] Yeah, that's right. Well, John, that means you went by the Lennon place, by the woods, over the bridge all the way to the highway without stopping at all, that right? - Yes. - That can't be true. It is true. But you said the last place you saw her was at the bridge. Now that's almost a quarter mile from the highway. Yeah, that's right, man, from the bridge. I rode back from the highway. When I got to the bridge, I looked back. Fran was just getting into a car. It was a 65 Mustang. It had orange license plates. John, there were kids swimming in the river under the bridge. Isn't it strange, none of them remember seeing it. There was just George and little Jerry. I remember George saw me, he even waved at me. We questioned George, he said he wasn't there and he didn't see you. He was there, it was him. John, you didn't go up to the highway, you didn't even get to the bridge. You turned off into the woods with Fran, now didn't you. No, she wouldn't let me. I told you she was in a hurry. John, it's over a mile from the school to the highway. Now that's a long way to take someone on your crossbar. You must have stopped or rest some place. Come on, you might as well admit that. No, I told you already, she wouldn't let me, she was in a hurry. Look, you were seen leaving the school yard. Mrs. Caruthers saw you on the road just before the Bush. Billy Anderson, wasn't a hundred yards behind her and he didn't see you. He didn't see you because you turned in the bush with Fran, now didn't you? He did, he must have. Did you see him? Well, yeah, he wasn't even looking at us. Look, he's not even eight. He forgets. Nevermind trying to psychoanalyze Billy Anderson, whether he is eight or whether he forgets or what, first was a bridge, then was the highway, then you said she wouldn't let you, then she was in a hurry. Make up your mind, John. - What story? - I you already! I took her to the highway, and then I saw her last at the bridge. Come on, John you stopped, you turned into the highway, you got hots for her, she laid down in the woods and- - No, no, I didn't take Fran into the Bush. I wouldn't hurt Fran, I told you. You liked Fran, didn't you? Oh yeah. You ever kissed anybody? Yeah. Kiss a girl, you kissed Fran, didn't you? No. You went in the woods, you start kissing her. Next thing you know, you didn't know what you were doing. No, I didn't- - Why don't you admit it! I didn't kiss Fran. No, I wouldn't. Don't provide different story. You ever kissed anybody, John! Just lost your mind! No, no, no would you listen to me! (both Sergeants shouting) No, no, no! I told you! You didn't get to the bridge. Trying to rape her? Nol. Come on, admit it! No! - Come on. - Yeah. Did you kiss Fran. Would you listen. Did you turn in the woods. No! [Vic] Someone had seen him turn into the woods. [Henderson] I mean, no matter how we put it together, we get nothing to nail him down. [Vic] Yeah, but Jack we put all the facts together. We got our case. What the hell else could have happened? It had to be Robinson. Had to, huh? What have we got? Tire tracks that match his match his. Match half the bikes in town. Footprints? All the kids run around in the bush in there. A crazy woman that saw him ride up to the woods and an eight year old kid that didn't see him go on by. An eight year old kid, for Christ sake. The only solid evidence we have comes from a baby who could have been watching a ladybug on the ground when he went past. Come on Jack. Yeah, but when I pull myself back from this, what do I see? A 14 year old kid, natural athlete. Never had any trouble in his life. But you've seen that girl, does it seem possible? None of it seems possible. First, I haven't seen one like this in all the years I've been a cop. I see. Okay, so we can't make it out. So what does that mean? Does that mean that a sharp eye by a 14 year old kid couldn't? We have to assume he couldn't make it out either. He's lying about the damn car. We have to, huh? Why? Because it fits with what we want. 'Cause it's too far away. [Henderson] I suppose. So. [Vic] Body was dragged quite away after it was over. And those few branches thrown over. Hey, that seems like a panic stricken kid, wouldn't it? I mean, if you're gonna hide a body or bury it you hide or bury it for Christ sake, you don't just throw a few branches on it. I suppose so. But whoever the animal was that did that, he could have panicked at that moment. You know what I mean? I mean, look, here's the guy, he's got his rocks off, the passion's off him already and he's back in the real world. And there's a very dead little girl lying there at his feet. Now I don't care who he is, he could have panicked at that moment. And if he's an older guy, he sure as hell could have panicked 'cause he know we're gonna hang him. Robinson wouldn't have thought about hanging. He wouldn't have thought about his own death, somehow that doesn't seem to fit a kid his age. [Vic] Rape murder doesn't. Shit, you're right. Anything's possible in this one. See the next one? Yeah, this one. So tell me, Vic, do you think a 14 year old would think to coil up her blouse and use it to wrap around her neck and strangle her with. Well picture this he's a kid just like you say, but he's always been fond of the girl, we know that. So there they are in the woods together, and well something cracks in his head and there he is raping her. Now he doesn't wanna Kill her, but she's screaming, she's gonna tell. So he has to kill her to shut her up. But he likes her, right? And he just can't bring himself to use his hands because it's, well, it's too personal, it's too intimate. If something crazy like that can happen in the middle of a rape. So he uses the blouse to do it 'cause he can't bring himself to strangle her with his hands. [Henderson] Jesus Christ, what are you saying? I'm saying that an adult rapist would have used his hands. The blouse is too damn consuming. Police today have announced the arrest of a 14 year old boy in connection with the death of pretty 14 year old Francesca Bailey. The dead girl is the daughter of the town's largest employer, Mr. Fred Bailey owner of Ontario Meats. The arrested youth a classmate of the murdered girl has been charged with capital murder. The girl's body was discovered Friday afternoon in a wooded area on the outskirts of the town. Due to the age of the accused, police are withholding all other information concerning the case. However sources within the Attorney General's department have disclosed that prosecutors will request to have the boy tried in adult court, thus opening the possibility of the imposition of the death sentence. The same sources said also that a death sentence for a minor has only occurred once previously in Canada and that was more than 100 years ago. (somber music) (lock clicking) To go see the calves at Lennon's. Uh-huh, he even came over on Thursday. Can you remember the time? Sure, right before I ate about 5:30 or so. Thank you, that's very nice. No trouble at all, Sergeant Henderson. Now then if you don't mind, I'll get back to making supper. I'll be inside if you want me for something. That's fine. Mrs. Koch. If you'll excuse me. Okay, now let's see... Thursday, 5:30. Right. Now tell me now, was there anyone else here who might have seen or heard him then? I don't think so. I was alone right here in the front porch. Maybe dad though. He might've seen in the living room. Mom was probably in the kitchen, she wouldn't have heard anything. Can you remember what he said? Sure, he asked me to go see the calves again. And what did you say? Gee, nothing I guess. He was on his bike, he just said to meet him there. And then he went away. I think I said, I wasn't sure if I could. I guess he figured I wasn't gonna come or something. Well did you go? No. Well, I guess I sort of stood him up. Later, you know, I went back to the bridge, not looking for him, you know, but I went back to the bridge and I thought of it. So I asked some of the kids if they'd seen him. When was that? Gee, must have been way past six then close to seven. I went back to the tree house too, but I didn't see him there either. Guess I was lucky, I didn't. Wasn't I? (soft music) (upbeat music) (machinery whirring) We can put Spencer in for now. You make up the schedules for him until we can find him. Oh, Jesus. My sweet Christ Jack, what's he doing in here? Get him out of my plant, don't want him in here. God damn it, get moving, I don't want him in here! Bob you'll have to understand. Fred isn't himself. He asked me to tell you that he'd like you to go home. Sure, Jack, I can understand that. Look, I'll take a few days- - No, Bob I'm sorry. He doesn't want you to come back at all. Supposedly you shouldn't have come in even today. I think you should have known how he'd feel. What the hell do you think I've been thinking about. You think I slept last night, maybe? My son in jail, his daughter's dead. I don't know what I was supposed to be thinking about, but all I could think of last night was what to do this morning. I thought if I didn't come in and it'd be like admitting something like, like John did it or something. I wanted to stay at home. Christ I wanna hide for the rest of my life, but I can't. I had to come in, don't you understand that? I understand that it took a lot of courage, Bob. I can see that, but he doesn't want you here. I knew that. Jesus Christ don't you I think I knew that, but I had to come in. If I didn't come in how could I look my son in the face. All right, all right! I'm going. Geez, I don't think I could keep it up. It's not courage, Jack. It's not courage. Just sometimes you've gotta do things you don't have any choice in the matter. You don't have any choices at all. I'll send your pay Bob, in seven. (machinery whirring) [Warden] You have 20 minutes, I'll be back after that. Are you frightened, darling? Are you frightened? It's gonna be all right, okay? Don't worry, Mommy. Look, Johnny keep your spirits up. This won't last long. We'll have you outta here in no time. They just made a mistake son and they'll figure it out soon enough. Yeah, I know dad. But it feels like I've been here forever. I don't even know what I'm doing here. Everybody else, they're all so old. I'm not like them. Would you tell them I'm not like the rest of them here, dad? Please, son just a little longer. Look, I talked to the lawyer. He said there's nothing to worry about. So you just buck up, eh? Come on now, where's my brave little Johnny boy. See, try to understand son, it's just that you were the last one to see her. They had to have somebody in here. That God damn Bailey, he had to have somebody in here. Pretty soon they'll realize they've got the wrong person and then you can come home and everything will be exactly the same as it was before. No, Dad it's never going to be the same. Why not? It's just never going to be the same. Everybody's gonna look at me behind my back. And no matter what happens, all the kids, they're all gonna be mean to me. If only you hadn't picked her up, Johnny, if only you hadn't had the bad luck to be there that night. - Dad. - What? You have to understand something, Mom, you too. I really liked Fran. I mean, I wanted her to be my girlfriend. I went to the school yard "cause I knew she'd be there. Oh great. I just wanted to see her, that's all. See dad, it wasn't bad luck, it was me. (classic music) Wanna hear a joke? Hi Frank. Hey, I'm sorry about what happened the other day. [Frank] Sorry about what? For throwing that stone at you. There won't be any trouble, I didn't tell anybody it was you that beat me up on me. And? It was mostly John's fault anyways. Do you think he really did it? Cops arrested him, didn't they? That's what my dad says. It says it must have been him. I heard him say that to my mom. My dad, my mom, what the hell do they know about it? For all they know it could have been you. Oh, yeah? Well it could have been you too, but it wasn't you and it wasn't me, it was John. Do you believe me? Yes, I believe you. Are you sure? [Lawyer] Why do you ask John? Because my own father doesn't even believe me. [Lawyer] That's not true, John. Of course, he believes you completely. No, I saw that he didn't. When he was here, it was something in his eyes. But I know that he didn't. [Lawyer] Well let's go on, okay. It was at the highway that you saw the car with the red plates? No, the plates were orange, not red. Was back at the bridge when I saw it. [Lawyer] Now you were interested in Fran as a girlfriend, is that right? Yeah, I was. She was really pretty. [Lawyer] You ever kiss her? No. [Lawyer] Have you ever had intercourse with a woman? [Lawyer] No. [Inmate] Oh, shut up, eh? Look, if you don't keep it down, I'll call the guard in here. [Inmate] You know what? You can do it. Gonna ask you that question again, John. Have you ever had intercourse with a woman? No. But you'd like to. That's stupid, everybody would, but when I say I want to, everybody thinks I'm a weirdo or something. Have you ever had an examination by a psychiatrist. No. Have you ever had to talk to the police about anything like a broken window or something like that? No. And you've never gone all the way with a girl? No, I haven't. I could have maybe. I think Nora might've let me, she let me feel her up once, but I never tried. Nora Cook? Yes. Now as the jury will be aware, it was decided at a preliminary hearing not to try this case in juvenile court, but in adult court despite the age of the accused. It was thought that only in this way would his interests and those of society be best protected. However, we're now going to examine the first of several child witnesses and some relaxation of authority and the strict rules of evidence seem called for. You may proceed Mr. Bonner. If it pleases Your Honor, I'd like to call bill Anderson. Call Bill Anderson to the stand. Bill Anderson. Take a seat, Billy. (audience laughing) Yes, that's fine. Billy, did you know Fran Bailey? Yes sir, I live next door. And do you know John Robinson? Can you point to him? Sure, that's John there. He goes to my school. You know that something happened to Fran. Now, do you remember the day? That's what we talked about. That was when I went swimming with Mrs. Caruthers at the bridge. She started home without me 'cause I wouldn't come. But then I ran long after her. I knew I'd get heck if I didn't. And did you catch up? Sure, she was waiting just past the bush. I want you to think very carefully now, Billy, before you caught up with her, did you go past anyone? No. You didn't see Fran and John on John's bicycle? No I didn't. They must have turned into the bush after they passed Mrs. Caruthers. Hold on a minute, please. That statement will be stricken and the jury will ignore it. Billy just tell us about what you saw, only about what you saw. Do you understand? Yes, sir. [Attorney] Well then when you went past the Bush, you didn't see Fran and John? No, sir. That is all, My Lord. Did you wish to question the witness? I do, My Lord. [Judge] Proceed. Billy. Did you see Wayne Armstrong pass you or Larry Forche? First, let me ask you this do you know these boys? Sure. Did you see them pass? Gee, I don't remember. Gosh, you must have, unless they disappeared. Mrs. Caruthers saw them. I don't know, I don't think I did. [Lawyer] And then they didn't pass you by a minute after she saw them. Well, I don't know. That'll be all my Lord. [Judge] Did you wish to redirect Mr. Bonner? No, My Lord. That'll be all Billy, you may go. Call your next witness. [Attorney] The Crown calls Nora Cook. Call Nora cook to the stand. Nora cook. He'd been asking me out a lot around then, he came over that night and asked me to go to the bush with him. And what did you say? Well, he just drove off. I didn't get a chance to say anything, but I didn't go though. So instead I guess- - No, no, no, Nora let's not have any guesses. Only what you saw and heard. Yes, sir. All the same you did go past the bush later up to the bridge. [Nora] Yes, sir around seven. No past that, I was just- - [Attorney] And did you see Fran and John beyond the bush? Maybe I put the bridge or anywhere along the road? No, they weren't around. (indistinct chatter) (crowd heckling) (banging on windows) (soft music) What's the matter, son? Bad dreams? No. I saw a mouse, it scared me. Don't let it bother you son. They come and go on their own business. They won't bother you, none. It's a lot different at night, isn't it? I mean in the daytime, there's all that fuss going on in the courtroom. Millions of people. And then at night, you all alone in the dark. I just wish I could be home in my room. Things wouldn't be so bad. But you know, sleeping here, it's so hard. I know, I know. But there's nothing we can do about it. Except maybe come around and talk a little like this. My name's Arthur, son. And yours I know is John. I'm glad you came. You're the first person who's talked to me normal. I mean the way people used to before all of this. And yet John says you saw him that evening. You saw him with Fran at the bridge, you even waved. No honest, he's making it up. I didn't go anywhere near the bush. The bridge. No, not there either. Honest it's the truth. You be sure it is. I don't want any witnesses of mine called lying on the stand, you understand? Yes sir. Yes sir, I know. So how about later at John's house? He said you came over and asked him if he'd taken Fran into the bushes. Yeah, I remember that. His mom was just leaving with Mrs. Linden. Yes. But why did you ask him if you'd taken the girl in the bushes if you hadn't seen them. Somebody must have told me, one of the kids. Who Frank, believe me it's very important. I can't remember. You have to. Look, this is the way it happened. I'll tell you exactly even though I promised I wouldn't. I didn't see them. But when I went to John's he was acting kind of strange. Then he asked me if I do 'em a favor. He said that if anybody should ask me, I should say, I'd seen him at the bridge earlier on, but he didn't explain why. After I found out what happened, I couldn't do it. But that's how I knew they'd been together. He told me.

Nora what's wrong? Nora? Nora. Nora, what's wrong? What's bothering you? Leave me alone. I'm not gonna leave you alone until you tell me what's wrong. Is it John, what is it? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? What are you crying about? I don't know if we did the right thing. Of course we did the right thing. Now don't worry about it, we both went to court, - we both testified. - Leave me alone. - Now don't worry about it. - Leave me alone! [Attorney] Do you recognize this, doctor? [Doctor] Well, this contains the contents of the victim's stomach. [Attorney] How did it come to be here? Well, I did it myself. Yes, you can see my initials on the label on the June 14th, the day following the discovery of the body. Yes, well now Dr. Parsons, could you describe the contents of this jar for the benefit of the jury? Objection, My Lord. Is this really necessary? Well? It is relevant, My Lord. If your Lordship will allow me a minute I- - Very well, very well proceed, but briefly please. Doctor. Well, it contains about a pint of a meal of mixed meat and vegetables. It was probably a thick lumpy stool. This kind of evidence is very valuable to us in fixing the time of death with a fair degree of certainty. And what is your conclusion in this case then? Well, the victim made her last meal about 5:30. It was still largely undigested at the time of death. It was poorly chewed, but taking that into account, it could have been in the victim's stomach no longer than two hours while she was alive. That would place the time of death at 7:30, I'd say between 7:15 and eight o'clock with 100% certainty. (indistinct chatter) Order order in this court! Order! It is your professional opinion then doctor that the victim died between 7:15 and 8:00 p.m. That is correct. Thank you, sir. That is all, My Lord. (indistinct chatter) Doctor, the time period you give as the period in which death occurred is almost exactly identical to the time period mentioned in earlier testimony concerning when John Robinson was with Francesca Bailey that evening. There's no need to hide the fact, Doctor the murmur in the courtroom tells us that everyone recognizes it. And no doubt at this moment, the jury finds it very interesting. Well, I say that I find it damn well suspicious and the most remarkable coincidence. Don't you agree, Doctor? [Attorney] Objection, objection Your Honor! [Judge] Objection sustained no more, no more. These implications are disgraceful and so is your language. I won't tolerate it in my court. Forgive me, My Lord I owe the court and apology. It's all money and the power. They got Mr. Bailey, he has money. He can afford all those people and all those experts. My dad can't. That's why I'm here. And you, you can't get me out because you haven't got enough power. My dad promised. And my mom. But I'm here all alone, and they can't do anything. (tense music) Do you ever lose your temper, John? Sometimes. Sometimes I do. And what do you do then? Please. I'm tired, I'm tired! Do you ever hit people when you're angry? No, I don't hit people. Stop! It hurts! It hurts! Stop! John, John there's nothing to be frightened of, now don't be afraid. Just try and remember you were in the woods with Fran, did she make you angry? Woods? [Doctor] That's right, she made you get mad. Did you hit her, John? It wasn't your fault. It wasn't your fault? It wasn't my fault. Wasn't my fault. The blood. What do you remember about the blood? Why are you mad at me? Frank beat them! Stop! Stop! Is that when you hit Fran? Fran? Yes John, Fran. Why did you beat her? No, I never beat Fran. I never did. You were just telling us a moment ago, John, remember? Frank, Brucey. Stop! Stop! [Doctor] John how did you get your penis all red and swollen? I fell off my bike. Tell the truth, John. I fell off my bike. Is that all, wasn't there anything else that happened? I touched it. I shouldn't have touched it. It fell good. His underpants were kept. I had to look at them myself at the time, later they were examined at the lab. At the time? Yes at the time that I examined the accused, that would be the second day following the murder. And what were your observations? Well, they were badly soiled, fouled, obviously been wearing them for a number of days or likely so. They were stained at the rear and had urine and sperm in the crotch. Sperm, Doctor. How did you know it was sperm? Well, I didn't know for sure, but I thought as much. It was confirmed later by the lab, that's how I know. [Attorney] And did the lab tests show anything else? Yes. Blood in small quantities of the area in the front of the crotch. Now doctor, I ask you this, would these conditions be consistent with sexual assault? Could the soiling you describe be accounted for in this way? Yes, it could be. It's possible. You also examined the boy physically, including the genital area, is that correct? [Doctor] Yes. [Attorney] Again, what were your observations? Well, it was very sore looking, quite swollen and reddened near what you call the distal end, and the business end. There was a scab had formed over a rip or cut along the left side of it. From the state of healing I would say about two or three days old. [Attorney] Can you explain how such an injury could be caused. A head long fall could have made those kinds of scrapes, I suppose. You see, I've never really seen one quite that sore. Well, now I did attend one once some time ago that a cow had stepped on. Now that was a lot sorer. (audience laughing) That was the last- - [Judge] Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! [Doctor] It seems that this fall- - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, Doctor. Could these injuries have been sustained during a sexual assault? Well, yes, that'd be one way. [Doctor] Fran didn't really want to ride from the highway with you, did she, John. You invited her somewhere, didn't you? Take Fran see the ponies. Ponies. [Doctor] Yes, John. Fran is with you, but instead of going where you said you were going, you went off into the bushes. No. To ponies. Ponies. Fran is so pretty, John. You wanted to be alone with her into the woods. Isn't that right? Went hopping into the bush. Didn't you? Mom. No! No! What did you do, John? Feed her to the fishes? What did you do, John? Feed her to the fishes? What did you do, John? Feed her to the fishes? What did you do, John? Feed her to the fishes? (indistinct chatter) The circumstances surrounding the murder of this little girl are revolting. Revolting. And you may ask who but a monster could be guilty of such a thing. Now the accused is charged with this monstrous crime, and he is about 14 years old. And this is it. You must not permit this lad's youth to sway you in any way from bringing in a verdict in accordance with your conscience. Finally, gentlemen, let me say this before you arrive at a verdict in this case, you must examine each piece of evidence. Is it consistent with the boy's guilt, inconsistent with any other conclusion? It's not this bit of evidence or that bit of evidence, but the cumulative effect of the whole on the whole. Is there any other conclusion, but that this boy murdered Francesca Bailey. If you think there is you will acquit him. If the evidence raises a doubt in your mind, you will acquit him. But when I say a doubt, I mean a reasonable doubt, not a foolish doubt and not doubt because you are hesitant to do your duty while I trust that you will accept your responsibilities in this matter. You will bring in a verdict in accordance with your conscience, but do not forget either what I said about the onus of proof. The onus is on the Crown. There is no burden whatsoever on the prisoner to prove his innocence. And that must be remembered. It is for the Crown to prove guilt and you must be sure. Now, gentlemen, let me say this, you may bring in a verdict of not guilty, the jury is always able to do that. You may bring in a verdict of not guilty. You may bring in a verdict of guilty as charged, but as I see it, gentlemen, there is no other verdict open to you in this case on this evidence. [Congregation] Father in the gracious keeping, lead me now, thy servant speaking. There the tears of earth are dried. There is hidden things are clear there.

His gracefulness shall take unto Himself the soul of this murdered child. (bell tolling) Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. (suspenseful music) (footsteps pattering) Gentlemen of the Jury, have you reached a verdict? We have. And how do you find the accused as charged, guilty or not guilty? Guilty as charged, My Lord. (indistinct chatter) Order, order in this court. Order! With a recommendation for mercy. Mr. Registrar. Have the prisoner stand, please. The sentence of this court upon you, John Robinson is that you be taken from here to the place from once you came and there be held in close confinement until Monday, the seventh day of February and upon that day and date, you be taken to the place of execution and that there be hanged by the neck until you are dead. [Narrator] The film you have just seen was based on a true story, the 1959, Stephen Truscott case. As you have witnessed Truscott at the age of 14 was found guilty of rape and murder. He was held in death row awaiting his execution for nine months, just two hours before his sentence was to be imposed the government bowed to enormous public outcry and commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. Truscott was paroled after serving 10 years in federal penitentiary, he is now living under an assumed name. He is married, has two children and is currently employed as an auto mechanic, a trade he learned in prison. The controversial case remains a glaring testament to the potential fallibility of a civilized world's judicial system. Recently when shown this film, Truscott remarked that he liked it and added that, "it gave a good insight into what it was like at the time." To this day, he proclaims his innocence. "At no time did I ever say I was guilty. I definitely am not, and I will never say I am guilty. In all the world today, only two people really know I'm innocent. One of them is me, the other is the killer." ♪ Old friends know you've got to go ♪ ♪ And let your heart begin again ♪ (soft music) ♪ Go down by the sea ♪ ♪ And hear ♪
