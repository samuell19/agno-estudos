There'll be some more eye candy like that in there. - Ooh, I can make no such promises. - damn. - Is that your car? - Ah, she is. - stick shift? - Mm-hm, always. I learned on it and then I... - My mom had an old Volkswagen that I used to drive, And wow, that just brings back some memories. - All good, I hope. - Except for the time johnny Braxton broke up with me. And spilled orange soda all over my car. It was the stickiest mess I ever had. I could never fully clean it up. - Men are like little children with breakups, right? It's like they want a little bit of attention. And they just don't know how to ask for it. Sorry, that was weird. Pilates, next Monday, I'll be there, And I won't be late this time. - All right, well, I'll see you there. - Ciao. - Bye. Okay, so I just wanna make sure. That I'm getting this right.

I'll be right back. Buster! Buster! This is my number, okay? I will. Thank you. - You're missing something? - Oh my god, buster, hi, baby! Oh my goodness. How did you? Right. Hi. - Yeah, found him eating an ice cream cone. Over in the park on west first. Strawberry, I believe, right? Yeah, so we stopped and got something healthy 'cause I figured he was sneaking dessert in before dinner. - Thank you. Seriously, you made my night. I was getting his dog tied engraved. And I guess he was exploring the neighbourhood. - Ah, that would be why he wasn't wearing his collar. - I'm gonna send you a venmo. - A reward? - Yeah, a thousand bucks? - Look, as much as I think that buster is worth every penny. And more, I, I can't. - Your membership, a year, on me. - No, no, no. I just, I can't accept that. - We insist. - Something tells me I'm not gonna win this argument. - No, not likely. - Okay, how about some private sessions? Spread-eagling my legs in front of a room full of women. Was, dare I say, intimidating. - Okay, all right, you got it. As many free privates as you can handle. - Deal. - Text message, someone spotted buster on west and third. I guess I should take the post down. Wow, it's already 6:30. - Guessing you skip lunch? - And breakfast. - Right, well I'm taking you for something. - No, no, no, you have done enough. - I'm claiming it as part of my reward. Plus, you likely don't know anywhere to eat. In this town yet, so... - Something tells me I'm not gonna win this argument. - No, not likely. Cheese curds, gravy and French fries. - Don't forget the ketchup on top. - that's what you grew up on? - Mm-hm, it's my favourite. It's called poutine. - Mm, and aside from buster, I'm assuming no kids? - Mm-hmm. - No, never married? - Divorced. - Oh, geez, yeah. See, I can tell by the look on your face. That that one didn't end well. - You ask a lot of questions. - I'm a journalist. It comes to the territory. We don't have to talk about it. - No, it's, it's fine. He cheated several times, So yeah, it did not end well. - Oh, thank you. - Let me. - Oh no, no, my treat. - Thank you. So what about you? - Five kids, three different moms. - Seriously? - Sometimes, sometimes, seriously, yeah. But no, definitely not that way. - Okay. - Never married, no kids. Had one serious girlfriend once, But that ended well over a decade ago. - Mm. - Mm. Dated someone briefly last year. That ended with the bang. - What happened? - She was intense, very, very intense. - How so? - Well, the first date was fun. The second date was more fun. And then the third date went south. We were at dinner, And an old colleague of mine was there with his wife. And they wanted to join us for a drink. They came over. I thought we had a great time, but at the end of the night, She was adamant that my friend's wife was hitting on me, And I on her. - Okay, well, were you, or was she? - Dolores is 71 years old. - Okay. - Yeah, with a serious bout of chin hairs. - mm. - She feels like any older lady. Who's been married for 40 years does in compliments, And I was doing nothing more than being amused by her. - She sounds like my mom. - Yeah, and she's old enough to be mine, too. - So what happened? You broke it off after that? - Do you really wanna hear about this? Come on. - Only if you wanna tell me. - Okay. Well, we met because we hired her tech firm. To do some of our social media stuff. - Mm-hm, and? - And she kind of, well, How do I put this? Started tracking me online. Yeah, out of the blue, she would bring up a tweet I've made. Where I tagged the journalist. Whose story would published through her, Retail owner who's shop we have profiled. In the local business section, Accusations that I was flirting with them, Even though I'd never met any of them. The final straw came when I came back from a run. To find her standing outside my house, waiting for me. She looked like she hadn't slept in a day, And she flew into a rage. About how I changed my running route. - She was monitoring your jogging routine? - I have no idea, didn't ask her, But to make a long story short, I cut it off. It had only been three weeks, And that was really long enough to realise. That it was just never gonna work. Hm. Hm. - That's weird. Barbara, reminder to RSVP. - Same. - It's an "eyes wide shut" theme. - Yeah, so now you know why I was hesitating to RSVP. - God, okay, call me conservative, But going to a wild party in a town. Where I literally know two people. Just sounds too adventurous for me. - Well, why don't you make it more adventurous. And just come as my date? - Your date? - Yeah, promise to keep my clothes on. "eyes wide shut" theme. - Right. - get it? - Oh, I get it. - okay. Put your number in there. What's your favourite song? - My favourite song? Something from your top ten. - Um... - Oh, I got it. - Got what? ♪ It's a perfect day ♪ What's happening? - It's your theme song in my phone. - That's my ring tone? - In, in my phone, yeah. ♪ Whatever come, what may ♪ - Okay, yeah, you've good taste in music. - Mm, thanks. - Giving me a ring tone in your phone gives you props. - Does it? - mm-hm. - Does that mean I'm picking you up at seven? - Seven it is. ♪ Makes me feel ♪ ♪ this perfect night for me ♪ - Wow. You look- - It's too much, I know. I just didn't have time to- - gorgeous. - Really? - Stunningly so. These of you. - They're beautiful, thank you. - Your chariot awaits, my lady. - oh, it's a beautiful party, And you're a beautiful woman. - Drinks? - oh, my, oh, my. - Uh, sorry, I thought you were someone else. - I can be anyone you want. - Uh, that's okay. Thank you, not tonight. - oh, it must have been my gold mask. - I love what you did, and we will, absolutely. - thank you, pierce. - here you go. - thanks. Everything okay? - Everything's fine. Just saw man that I thought was you from behind. - Hm, did he hit on you? - He did, actually. - Va-va-voom! Look at you two. - Barbara? - The one and only. - wow. - Hey, bud. - Frank, thanks so much for the invite. - Are my eyes playing faint. Or did you and pierce arrive together? - We did. - Oof, you lucky, lucky girl. - Okay, chocolate mint martinis, How did they warm their way into the theme? - Well, dark chocolate is an aphrodisiac, my dear. How do you not know that? - Barbara, I can't believe you live here. This place is massive. - It's way too large for us, but Barbara refuses to move. - Mm, what can I say? I like them big. - Okay. Do you mind if I give her the tour? - Of course, feel free to wander. - cheers. - That's the theme of the party. - This place is, it's like an art gallery. - appropriate, wouldn't you say, For the great granddaughter of Harold Gershwin? - The minimalist artist of the 1920s? - that's the one. - Oh, wow, okay, So these are... - Very expensive. - hmm. - Beautiful, isn't it? - yeah, it is. - What do you think has transpired between them? - Oh, art is about perception. It's in the eye of the beholder, isn't it? - It is. So what would yours be of this? - An argument, maybe? He's asked for forgiveness, and, And, she's given in, again. What's yours? What is your perception? - Well, he's, he's worried. She's exhausted. Maybe he saved her. He really hurt you, didn't he, your ex-husband? - He did. Cheating, you know, it just feels like betrayal. Over and over again, he would cry. And pledge he would never do it again, And I would forgive him, Losing a little bit of myself each time, My, my self esteem diminishing. Until I didn't even recognise myself anymore. I became numb. No more desire, no more lust for him. I, I just was. The worst part was that I became someone. Who couldn't even... - Trust anymore? - Exactly. - You're beautiful, Amelie Didot, Inside and out. Should we continue the tour? - Let's. Is the lady's room that way? - Yes, it is. Why don't I grab us a plate of appetiser. And meet outside in five? - Perfect. - Oh, sorry. - Pierce? Pierce? Oh my god, someone help me! Someone help! - Amelie? - Pierce? - If you remember anything else, here's my card. - Thank you. - I can be anyone you want. - Let's get you home. - Reach those arms up to the sky on an inhale, Straight as a board. Exhale, bring them down to your side and curl the spine, Drawing the navel in as tight as you can to the spine. And if that's too hard Fran, You can just bring them right back down into tabletop. Nice job. Good job. Hold that position. Belly drawing in toward the spine. - I need to talk to you after class. - Sure, sure thing. All right, good job, nice. Keep those arms straight. Just 30, more seconds in this position. Bye, ladies, good job today. - Wow, great class. - You know, I have a three-for-five promo. Going on right now. Maybe you wanna sign up for that? - I actually saw that in the newspaper. - It's good to know all my advertising is paying off. - Sure is. - Are you doing some construction? - Oh no, that's just, that's the little side thing. I got a project that I'm doing. - You know, it looks like your pen exploded in your bag. - Oh, shoot! Damn it. - I destroyed my favourite satchel with an exploded pen. It's the worst. I never carry pens in my purse after that. Hey barb. - I, I've gotta run. I got a call from my daughter, but I will call you later. - Okay, is everything okay? - It's fine. - Bye, barb. - Uh-huh. - Well, if you find a plan online, Just feel free to sign up for it. - Sure. - Uh, I hate to rush you out the door, I just, I have a private session starting soon. - Oh, you teach private lessons now? - Yeah, it's just the one client right now, And it's, it's kind of a pro Bono type of thing. - Really? - Yeah, my dog ran off, And, and he actually found him. This is what he wanted for the reward. - It's not the hunk I saw leaving your class. When I missed it the other day? - It is, actually. - I'll think about that membership. - Thanks for coming? Mm, seriously? - You all right? - Yeah, yeah, I just got this client. Break my picture frame though. - What do you mean? - She slammed it down, breaking the glass. - That's weird. - Yeah, just added to all the other weirdness. Happening as of late. - hmm. - Guess I shouldn't be surprised. Speaking of which, any leads? - No, not really. Police are still keeping the case pretty quiet. I'm waiting on more information. Before I publish anything in my paper. We're working on a pass for now. - Have you ever covered a murder before? - Yes, but not one in my own backyard. It's all a little bit bizarre, Where it was and, you know, you. - Me? Ah. - Oh. - You know what? I have band-aids. - Yeah, you know, just how you found him and all that. - It's like a bad dream. Not too mention, barb wouldn't even look at me today. Maybe she feels weird seeing me because of it. - No, I doubt that. I'm sure she just feels the same as you about it. After all, it did happen in her home. - Yeah. - I also learned that the man, Brian, Was a university friend of Frank's, Probably was quite a good one. So, you know, I think everyone's just feeling little out of sorts. - Yeah, you're probably right. - There we are. Good as new. - Thanks, doctor. - Take my advice, I know it's hard, Just try and forget about it. - I'm trying, trust me. You wanna get started? - Let's do it. - Perfect. - I just wanna make sure your core is doing all the work. You shouldn't be feeling anything in your back. Old pro, it seems. - No. - That's it. All right. - Okay, how do I dismount this thing? - I believe in you. - Gratefully. - Okay, lay down onto your back. We're gonna do my favourite, bridges. Okay, feet pushing the floor, arms down by your side. We're gonna inhale, and one vertebrae at a time, We're gonna roll up through our spine, okay? Inhale. Mm-hm, and we're just gonna pulse at the top. - like this? - Yeah, just like that. - I feel ridiculous. Okay. There you go, you got it. - No, I like this. - you do, do you? Okay, it's close, but can I show you? - Sure, yeah. - See how I'm squeezing my butt muscles? You wanna make sure you're not feeling anything. In your back. See? - Oh, yes I, uh, Yeah, no, that's, um, that's helpful. - And to work both the buttocks, you hold. Hello, delivery. - sorry, I thought I closed that. - Nothing to apologise for. - this is so unprofessional. I feel ridiculous. - Ridiculous? Ridiculous like I can't get you off my mind? - You can't? - No. - Dinner at my place Friday night? - All right. - Looks like our hour is up. - I think it is. - Thanks for a great class. You have an amazing rest of your day. - I will, you too. - Hey, did you see the draft of the mansion murder? - Mansion murder, seriously? - An "eyes wide shut" theme party. Where a local entrepreneur was murdered. - Yes, I get the angle, But not for this one, okay? - Okay. Brian left behind two kids. And a lot of grieving family members and friends, Many of whom I know personally, So we're not gonna sensationalise this one, okay? Let's just publish information confirmed by the police. - Which I did, but I will change the headline. In the meantime, can you take a look at it? It's in the online drafts folder. - Yep. Yeah, looking now. Thanks. Dale! - what? - What the hell is this? - What do you mean? - "sources close to the investigation say. That Amelie Didot is thought to have been. In a romantic relationship with the deceased. Didot, a Canadian transplant. "Is currently under investigation for running a sex ring." - Where does it say that? - "out of her newly-established Pilates studio." - I didn't write that, boss. - What do you mean you didn't write it? - I mean that I didn't write that. I've never seen that photo before. And I don't even know who she is. I think our system's been hacked, pierce. - Open your account now and erase it. We need it off the system and change the pass-codes. - I don't know how to change the pass-code. - Well, call Brody in tech. Do it now! - I mean, are you doing okay? - Yes and no. I guess I just, I can't believe it happened. It seemed so unreal. - I can imagine. - Hey, I, I don't wanna make you feel uneasy, But you know that woman that you were talking to. After class the other day? - Ooh, the oddball who broke my picture frame. And got ink all over my floor. - She broke your picture frame? - Yeah, she slammed it down and smashed it. It was so weird. Maybe she was having a bad day. - Okay, you cannot let her back in your studio. Or anywhere near you for that matter. - Why? - Amelie, that was Pierce's ex. Does pierce know that she was there? - No, she left the studio before and he came. - Good. I am gonna give you the same advice. That pierce is gonna give you, You need to keep her away from you. - How do you know her? - I don't, I only met her in passing. She and pierce were at the movies. I guess they were on their second date. The following day, I get a text message from her. Asking if she wanted to meet up. - Like, like out of the blue? - Yeah, so I assumed that pierce gave her my number. And I felt obligated to get together with her. Anyway, we meet for lunch and she seemed fantastic at first. You know, she started even telling me. How sexually compatible she and pierce were. I did find it. - Of course. - And then she starts to dig, like dig up stuff on pierce. She even went as far as to ask if he and I had ever dated. She said, "I couldn't help but notice. How you kissed him on the cheek the first time we met." Uh-huh, and get this, next time I run into pierce, He told me he had to break up with her. Because she was becoming excessively jealous. To the point of being obsessed with him. He also shared with me he had no idea. That we got together for lunch. Or how she even got my number. I, I tell you what, this is just crazy. I, I saw her there that night. I swear, I saw her. By the time I got down to see her, see if it was her, She'd taken off into the crowd. You know, I, I wasn't worried about it at first, But if that was her, she noticed you. - Noticed me? - Why do you think she came to your studio? Listen, you have got to be careful. Ever since my party, I am thinking the worst of everyone. Yeah, let's get out of here. - yes, yes, I'll see you tonight. I'll see you at the studio. - yeah, see you in class. - hey you. - Hey, what are you doing over here? - I was just driving by, but you need a lift? - Uh, no, no, nothing, Um, but I'm, I'm good. Thank you. - Okay. - Do you live around here? - No, but my favourite pizza joint does so, you know. - Right. - Why don't you get in? I'll totally give you a ride. - I'm, I'm good, thanks. Actually, that's my car share, but thank you. - I'm literally offering to save you some money, Give you a ride. It's not a big deal. - Thanks, thanks, I'm good. Another time. - Whatever. - Hi, it's Amelie, uh. - Welcome to my humble abode. - By humble abode you mean lavish mansion? - Tomato, tomato. Certainly keeps the rain off. You hungry? - starving. - That's good, kind of went all out. - thank you. - My mother's recipe. - Mm, yum. - So have a confession. I miss-gauged the cooking time. So we have about half an hour til dinner. - Okay, well, how about a tour? - Mm, but of course, madame. Right this way. Last, but not least. - You've got to be kidding me. - You don't have pools in Montreal? - They do, which is usually a hole in the ground. - How was your dinner with barb? - It was nice. Yeah, you were right, she's just been rattled. By the whole murder, rightfully so. She did tell me something that she felt I should know. - What's that? - She cautioned me about your ex. - My ex? - Fran. You remember me telling you about that woman. That came into my studio and smashed my picture of buster? - She's been to your studio? - Had a one-time class. - Okay, there's something I didn't share with you earlier. I had to take a restraining order out on her. It's a first, trust me. That's alarming that she came to your studio. It's just too much of a coincidence. - You know, everyone takes breakups differently. This is embarrassing, but I even Googled the woman. That my ex-husband is now seeing. I looked her up on social media. It's kind of normal to quasi stock your ex's new girlfriend. - This is different. - All I'm saying is that maybe she's just having. A hard time letting go. Just might take some time. - I hope you're right. - Let's change the subject. - Yes, please, but you must tell me. If she comes back in there. - Promise. You swim often? - Every day. - Every day? - Every day, every day but today. - Oh, you're just, You're gonna get in right now, okay. - No time on the present. Are you coming? - How can I resist on an evening like this? ♪ Now, I dare you to ♪ ♪ take me to you ♪ ♪ Make my dreams come true ♪ - a swimmer! Synchronised. - Handstand master. - Handstand master? You are, you're the handstand master. ♪ Make my dreams come true ♪ ♪ don't close your eyes ♪ ♪ I dare you to ♪ ♪ take me to you ♪ ♪ come and make my dreams come true ♪ ♪ Take in the song ♪ - That was good. - Yeah, it wasn't quite as good. As the chicken I made you, but close. - It's a good thing your fire alarm is loud. I've never seen anyone jump out of the pool that fast. Let me help you clean up. - Oh no, don't worry. It's my favourite bit. Seriously, I put a pod-cast of Piketon massacre. And away I go. - Piketon massacre, what's that? - It's only the best true-crime pod-cast there is right now. - Oh, really, okay. Looks like your fire alarm triggered something. - that's a first. - Burning a meal? - Yeah, that too, but never triggered my fire alarm. - I just had a security system put in my place, too. - yeah? - Mm-hm, it was a freebie, But I now feel like I'm living the life of the elite. - So that makes me elite? - Have you seen my purse? - Maybe over there? - mm. Oh my god. - what's that? - Well, it looks like a, a pen exploded in my purse. That's so weird. - It's weird that a pen exploded in your purse? - No, it's just that, Oh shoot, that is my ride share. - You know I could have given you a ride. - I know, but that might have led to something. That we're not quite ready for just yet. - Mm-hm, true, but at the expense of sounding cliche, That was sincerely the best evening I've had in years, So thank you. - It really was. And thank you for these warm clothes. I will return them promptly. - Don't forget my flip flops. - Those too. Thanks, have a good night. Buster? Bus! Buster, where are you, buddy? Buster? Hi, there you are. Hi. Hi baby. Why are you sticky? Did you get into something, b, hmm? You want some dinner? It's just the wind, baby, just the wind. There you go. Poured orange soda all over my car. It was the stickiest mess I ever had. - 911, what's your emergency? - Sorry, I didn't, I didn't mean to call. Come on buddy, let's go to bed. Security assistance. - Yes, hello, this is pierce Dalton. Over on eighth avenue. - how can I help you? - My security system seems to be on fritz. - Let's check, when did it begin? - Yeah, it began last night. - Sure, your system was deactivated at 9:47 pm. - What do you mean, it's deactivated? - Amelie, I'm on the way. Lock the doors and wait for me. Do not open to anyone. It's about Fran. See you in a minute. - Hi. You mentioned you had security cameras? - yes. - And you can watch the footage on your phone? - Yeah. - Fran? - It's not activated. - I forgot to do that. There's something I should have told you. After I met with barb, I was walking home, And Fran offered me a ride. - She was following you? - I didn't think it was anything to worry about. She had pizza. She said she was in the area. - She was in my home, Amelie. I saw her on the security system today. - Your security system? - While you were there. She had your purse, she looked dead into camera, She pulled a pin or something out of her ear. - It's a pen. When she first came to my class, She had ink leaking from her bag. And I told her this story, I know this sounds stupid, But how I don't carry pens in my purse anymore. And then I also told her this story. About how I spilled orange soda in my car. She's been here. Pierce, I, I know this sounds nuts, But it's the only thing that makes sense. - Back door? - Yeah, I made sure that was locked last night. - But the front door, was that open when you got back? - Yes, but it slammed. It was open and then shut, like the wind, maybe. There's more. Barb told me she thinks she saw Fran at the party. She's not sure, but she thinks so. - She's following you, pierce. - She's following you, too. This has got to stop. - Who are you calling? - Kip, lead investigator on the case. It is out of control. It's going to voicemail. Kip, it's pierce Dalton. I need you to call me as soon as you can, it's urgent. You okay? - I feel like I'm gonna be sick. - Let's get some fresh air. You know, I grew up around here. - Aren't you English? - What gave that away? No, my dad's an engineer. Got hired by a tech firm here in the us, Moved when I was 10. - That must have been a big change. - Yeah, but a good one. I really wasn't a fan of the cold weather. Anyway, my brothers and sisters used to swim in this ocean. Back in the day it was great. - In Montreal, it was just, we lived right downtown, So it was just concrete city walks. Pierce. I'm scared. - I blame myself for this. Getting you tangled up in all this, It's, you just met me at a funny time. Is he okay? - Come on, buster. He's just not used to going to the bathroom on the beach. - Oh, oh, he needs to pee? - yeah. - Yeah, I'll go, take him to little boys' room. Come on, come on. - hey. - Hey. - Uh, my head. - hey, doc, she's up. - Hello, Amelie, I'm Dr. Neifel. We're happy to see you awake. Do you know where you are? - At the hospital? - That's right, do you know how you got here? - I was hit. - I'm gonna flash a light in your eyes. It's gonna be a little bit uncomfortable. Just bear with me, okay? Can I have you look to the left? And now to the right. Great, how do you feel about talking to the police? They have some questions for you. - What kind of questions? - Just some things to jog your memory. - You can use that button there if you need me, Just go ahead and give it a push. - Thanks. - Excuse me. - Um, listen, if, I'm sure they can, If you're not up to it. - No, it's okay. - We're interested to recall. If you remember having a conversation with the woman. The evening of your friend Barbara Gershwin's party. Wondering if you remember being approached. By a woman that you didn't know? - I don't know, I, I talked to a lot of people I didn't know. I'm new to town. - Is there anyone or anything that seemed peculiar? Anything that you could think of could help. - Is that your car? - I saw Fran running from that room. She had a, a fire bolt earring. She came from the room. Pierce, the room I found Brian. Don't hesitate to call if he's too much. - And interrupt a weekend away. With that tall glass of hunkiness? Not a chance. - ready? - let's do it. - Oh, could you do me a favor and toss this in the garbage? I don't wanna sound the alarm, But maybe a mouse has been around. I found a pile of it in my bathroom. And I don't know, Maybe the little critter was trying to dig a hole. The property manager's gonna send by. The exterminator, though. Didn't your house get inspected? - No. - But if there's a mouse in the house, Buster will find it, right? - Yes, he will. I'll throw this way for you. - Okay, hill up girl, have fun. Just set it next to the bin, I'll grab it later. - Thank you, Margaret. Call if you need anything, okay? Anything at all. - See you Margaret. - Bye now. - This place is a little slice of heaven. - But if it's heaven, then you must be an angel. - That was the cheesiest thing you've ever said. - Couldn't resist. Yeah, my parents discovered the keys. Right after we moved to Florida. Settled in and they bought this beach house, So I come here as much as I can. - It's beautiful. Hey, can I ask you something? - Anything? - Why do you think Fran's having a hard time letting go? You said your first couple dates were fun. - Yeah, they were fun. She was, she was fun. But then she wasn't. This is obsessive behaviour and I'm not a psychologist. I can't begin to understand how someone becomes this way. I even felt bad for her in the beginning, But now this is, it's just gone on too long. I mean our whole relationship, if we can call that, Was just three weeks. Yeah, I knew her for a year before that. She'd come and go from the office, but I don't know, I guess what I'm trying to say is. It's just all a bit unbelievable, really, Getting tangled up with someone like her. - Yeah. - How's your head? - It hurts, but it's getting better. - You hungry? - Getting there. This is so good. - It's never a bad time in season for stone crab. - Unless you're a crab. Try that. - Mm. - Yeah? - Even better. - Does that work? - Of course. - hm. ♪ Everybody's got secrets they try to hide ♪ ♪ but I am revealing every single one of mine ♪ ♪ meet me in the dark, if you wanna ♪ ♪ meet me in the dark, if you're gonna ♪ ♪ take your time ♪ ♪ meet me in the dark ♪ ♪ meet me in the dark ♪ ♪ breathing slow, reflections like sail on sail ♪ ♪ undertone, entice me into my air ♪ ♪ all of my body, my vision, my mind ♪ ♪ capture me, show me the way ♪ ♪ too divine ♪ ♪ meet me in the dark, if you wanna ♪ ♪ meet me in the dark, if you're gonna ♪ ♪ take your time ♪ - Good morning. - Good morning. - Oh my god, you're stunning. - I'm thinking of going down to the beach. And collecting some shells. - Sounds good, maybe we can go snorkeling later. I'm sure we'll find an empty conch shell. This time of the season. - Mm, I'd love that. - God, I love your lips. - Hey, hey, girl! Hey, beautiful day, right? It's a little windy. Oh, I love seashells, and dogs, too. It's a shame so many people complain about them. On the beach, am I right? I always had a cat growing up, So I never thought too much about a dog, you know? It's always this like love/hate relationship I have with them. But since we're all about love recently, I figured we'd go with that. So good to see you. - Pierce! Pierce! She's here! - Where? - She went that way. - where? - Yes, yes, she was just right there. - Pack our things up quick. Let's go back to the city as soon possible. Amelie is texting the address now. - Got it, I'll connect with the local authorities now. In meantime, you two stay safe. - Okay, thanks, kip. - She texted, she locked herself out of my place. With buster inside? - You left her a key, right? - No, I, I didn't think she would need to get into my place. - I am so sorry, sweetheart. I don't know how on god's sweet planet I locked myself out. - How did you even get it in? - Well, the exterminator. She said she needed to check your place. - Buster! Buster! Buster! Fran, outside, said something about dogs. Ah! Buster! Baby. - There you go, baby, there you go. It's okay, it's okay. - The thumb drive from the security cameras. The night of the party? How'd you get this? Barbara said she turned off the system. For their people's privacy. - They did, but they forgot about this one. Because it only faces the back lane way. I should have brought it to you right away when I found it. - So it's the back lane way's footage? - And someone is seen running out the back of the house. Fits the timeline. - this will help. - Well, I bloody well hope so. Someone must have seen her, know where she is. - We think. - Her computer, did we verify that she hacked our system? - Yes, we say it's a work computer from work, And her employer has denied her access. To all of her accounts. Unfortunately, we don't have enough just yet. To issue a warrant for her home, But we put eyes out front, and this should help. I'm gonna head back to the precinct now. She's dangerous, pierce. And worse, Amelie has a target on her back. We're gonna do the best we can, But you're gonna need to look out for her. - Strengthening your core. Nice, you really wanna feel this in your abdomen. Good. Now one more pull. That's it, one more. Nice job, ladies. Thank you for another great class. Okay, I'll see you guys next week. - ugh. - bye, have a good one. Thanks for coming. - Hey, are you okay? - I'm fine. - Did you have to get stitches? - Uh, just five. - Just five? - Yes, I'm taking precautions, barb. - Well, I just have one question, Is he really that good in bed? - way to make light of the situation. - Well, it's a valid question. Oh, someone's ears must have been burning. - Hey barb. - Hey, are you doing okay? - Yeah, I'll be better when Fran's caught. - Yeah, won't we all. Okay, I'm out of here. You call me if you need anything. - I will, let me walk you out. - yeah, thanks. - Locking the door, that's smart. - I just don't want any more surprise visits. - Yeah, do you have a minute? - I just finished the last of my class, so yeah, sure. Did something else happen? - No. I don't think we should see each other anymore. - Excuse me? - It's not, everything I've said stands. - But? - But this isn't healthy. - For you or for me? - Look at you, Amelie. This isn't safe anymore. - No. - No? - I'm not letting her win, pierce. - This isn't about winning. - No, it's about control, And I refuse to let Fran control me, Or you for that matter. I'm not even scared anymore, pierce, I'm angry. Pierce, I can't help but believe. That we came into each other's lives for a reason. You've opened me up in ways that I just, I never thought possible. And if we break up, We're just giving her exactly what she wants, And when will that end? Pierce, it won't. I'm not gonna lose you. - Are you sure? - Kiss me. It's not coming off. - Here, let me have a go at that. - I'll check the security camera. Okay, it's just Margaret. - Hi. - Hi. I hope I'm not disturbing. - Of course not. - I made a lasagna and I had extra. Thought you might enjoy it. - That's so thoughtful of you, thank you. Wanna come in, join us for dinner? - I'd love to, but my show starts in 10 minutes. And it's the finale. - Mm, you can't miss the finale. - I do this remote viewing party with my sister. On the computer. It's just kind our thing. - I'm gonna make a salad, and we'll bring you a bowl. I'll text you. - No rush, sweetheart. Bye bye. - Bye. I'm so excited.

I can't wait. - Margaret, Margaret! - There, okay, the store on the corner. - You're looking for something to clean the mirror? - Yeah, it's just the vinegar wasn't working. - Hey, I really think you should go for a run. - Yeah, I just don't think it's a good idea leaving you here. By yourself right now. - Hey, hey, I'll be okay, okay? You'll be quick. Plus, we need the glass cleaner, so you can pick some up. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. - Lock the door. - I will, I will. - Have you heard anything? - No, nothing yet, but the locks have been changed. And police are monitoring Fran's house. - You're not home alone, are you? - No, pierce is here. - Man of the hour. Now when you say he's there, he's there, there? - Technically, no, but he'll be back soon. - why are you doing this to me? - Whoa, Fran! - You said that you love me. - Okay, we've been over this, okay? - You said that you love the way that I touched you. - No, I love nothing about you. Let me be crystal clear on that. - She is a whore, pierce, And I see the way she touches you, And she thinks that no one's watching me, And guess what? Guess what? I've been watching this whole time. And everything she does infuriates me, And everything you do infuriates me. - You need to stop this. Stop it. - You make me so angry, pierce. It's like I see red. You do this to me! - You need to calm down. - You do this to me! - Calm down! Calm down, okay? - I thought it was you. - Brian? - He dressed like you, he, he looked like you, He even smelled like you. - Were you... - He took his hands down my pants. - Well, so what, so you killed him? - Yes, I killed him. I didn't have a choice. Because you weren't there to protect me. - Okay, I'm gonna walk away right now. Don't you dare follow me. - Do not walk away from me, pierce. - What are you doing? - If I can't have you, no one will. She cannot have you! - Stop, stop! - Help! - Stop! - hey! - Help, he's got a knife! He's got a knife! - stop! - Get off of me! - hold still! - She's wanted by the police! - Stop fighting me. - Yeah, I'm at the park, at the corner of fifth. I'm holding down a white male, approximately six one. He just attacked a woman with a knife. - Fran gibbons, Fran gibbons. Just tell them the woman is Fran gibbons. - Send an officer now, please. - Tell them! Hi, this is Margaret. Please leave a message. - I really loved. - Margaret? - incredibly supportive, We gotta find somebody. That's gonna put up with your stupidity. - Margaret! - and really help you accomplish your dreams. - Margaret, I have your salad! - never thought you'd be able to accomplish. Margaret! Where are you?

Fran, I promise you I'm not. - Did he tell you how perfect we were, Did he tell you that? - Fran, he did. - He told me and all these women just kept interfering. And I know I was so good to be true. Everyone just kept telling him lies and lies about me. - I don't think that's what happened. - Shut up! That is what happened! I know what happened! - This needs to end, Fran. - You can't keep living like this, okay? I'll help you, I promise. I promise I'll help you. - You took him from me. - He's not a possession, Fran, he's a person. - person? - He's an ordinary person. - He's mine! He's mine! He's mine! - Amelie! What did you do, Fran, huh? What did you do? - She was trying, she was trying to kill me. I'm a victim here, not her. I'm the victim!

With you and him? - Considering that it's called a private, maybe. - Oh, please, pierce, Don't feel the need to put a shirt on on my account. - Putting it on because that one's dirty. - Mm, he's cheeky. - Okay, bye, barb. - Okay, okay, never know, I might sign up for my own lesson some day. - Bye! - Bye! - How did he do? - Great, stopped every five seconds to pee on a flower, But otherwise a runner. - I think I prefer you without that. - Mm, okay.
