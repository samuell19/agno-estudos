Duh, sorry I'm late, Ma. When do we eat, huh? Huey, my baby. Ma? Here, take this. Alan, come on. - Will you let me hear it? Alan, come on. I wanna hear this. Alan? Hi there, baby. Hey, why don't you and me find someplace real private? There's one guy who comes every night... and he's a troublemaker. Okay. I thought you said you were the only one here. It's that halfwit. He sweeps up around here. All the time? At night too? He sleeps there. Do you really wanna talk to that piece of puke? He works here, doesn't he? Hey, Jimmy! You're really gonna like him. He's what you would call: Your perfect asshole. You sure are a thirsty fellow. They don't look very happy, do they? Do you know who I am? No. I'm your uncle. What does that mean? It means your mother is my sister. Younger or older? Exact same age. Hey, I just thought of something. Wait right here. I got something good for you. You'll like it. I know. That's so loud. That was crazy. Do you wanna give it a try. Okay. Wait one second. Okay. All right. Ready? One, two, three. Push it down hard. Push it down. Push it down. Yeah, like that. Hey, Mosiah, can you come inside? It's time for your nap. No, no, no. That's yours, man. That's yours. Enjoy it. So, what's your job again? I'm a carpenter. Well, that makes sense. What does? Carpenters usually live in shitty-looking houses. He's horrible. They all are. Just stay as far away from them as you possibly can. Could I stay here? No. Watch this. Wait. Jesus fucking Christ! That's great! That's really witty! Just get the fuck out! Just take your shit and go! Please, I don't want you near my kid! You fucking bastard! I'll kill you! I'll fucking kill you! That was angry. Hey! What'd you do to your leg? Help! Oh, shit. Hang in there. Help. Help! Hang on. It's here. Have you ever seen the move... Les Dents De La Mer? 'The Teeth Of The Sea'. 'Teeth Of The Sea'. No. Have you ever seen the movie Jaws? No. I don't think so. Oh, yes! Yes! All right. I'm with somebody. I just wanted... Just to... Just to get my friend. Come on, please. Get outta here. There is a man... I know you cannot understand me... and there is nothing that you can do... to help me, even if you could. You see? Your line of fate is connects with your line of... You're very different with your line of... Yes? Why? Want a doggie treat? No more! Milk! Go get some milk! Go! Go! Go! Please, please! Hurry! Hey! Is it okay if I walk along with you? I guess. You've got some milk there? What type is it? Just regular milk. You might want to look again. I think it is buttermilk. Are you doing some baking? Baking some biscuits maybe? Well, if not, some 2% or even warm milk... would have been more ideal for drinking. I prefer 1%. Just creamy enough. Then there is acidophilus, another interesting milk. It's kind of tangy, but... very good for intestinal health. Yeah. Milk is very amazing. It's good for you. Doesn't the breeze blowing up out of the ocean make your dick hard? It was in-between us when I woke up. Who does it belong to? Stop it! Shit! You know, we should've been by the school by now. We passed it. Where? Right there. Back there? - Yeah. You're wrong. Slow down! You gonna miss the turn! What's your problem? Asshole! Boom! Shit! I think we're stuck. See these things here? Here, right here. They're the last ones that came here to give me a hand... and didn't get up at 7:00 in the morning. So... when I call you... hop up. We eat outside... and we've got K.P. You can use the house. There's work gotta be done. I don't care how you split it up... as long as it's done. Where do you sleep? I sleep here in the garage... and if you'll need me late at night... this is where I'll be. And if you gonna go to the latrine... and have a shit, there's a shovel by the tree over there... and you go at least a 100 feet and dig a cat hole. What about the bathrooms in the house? Don't they work? Yeah, they do work, but the people that own it... and live there... they're the ones that are entitled to use it. We only work here. That's it. And don't go out into the marsh... because if you go into the marsh and get lost... you're gonna be fucked, and I mean, severely fucked. Any questions? And are you hungry? This is beautiful. Have a look at this. She's a fatty old chicken, this one. Not bad. Few different colors. Nice. That'd fill you up. Why don't you just go to the store... like a normal person? I do go to the store, the P.X. store. What do you mean, 'like any normal person'? I am a normal person. It's beautiful. Look at that. Lovely. You know. Got vitamins in it. Noodles. Not dead yet. This tree... took a serious hit at some stage in its life. See this? This is a scar. Big-ol', strong-ass tree. An helm. So, what killed it? These two hands... and this saw. But don't feel too bad about it... 'cause it was half-dead anyway. Five, six... seven, eight, nine... ten, eleven, twelve... thirteen, fourteen... fifteen, sixteen... seventeen, eighteen... nineteen, twenty, twenty-one... So, what actually happened here? It got dragged by the car. He took off... when I wasn't all the way in. My foot got slammed in the door. It was an accident though. So what actually were you in the army? Well, if you just wait till I finish this... and wait a moment, I'll show you. Wait a second. Here. I was a medic. See? A medic. Looking after the people that were hurt and wounded. I think you might need a few more weight. There you go. That's what I did. Fucking crazy, right? What's this? What's that? That's... Zyklon B. It's a nerve gas. The Nazis used to use it to kill people. They'd crowd 'em into a room... they'd get 'em together, crowd 'em into a room... lock 'em in and gas 'em. Kill who? The Jews or anybody they didn't like. Know what this is? - A gas mask? Yeah. It's Israeli. Sorta goes together, doesn't it? Now... I sell this stuff on the internet. I sell it on the internet... to supplement the income... make a bit of extra money. Who buys that kind of stuff? Collectors. True believers. You know? Does this bother you? No. Good. Because it's only history... and history, good or bad... can't hurt you. And see this? See that? In the 1930's... everybody your age had one of these. It was like the boy scouts. And, even the pope had one. Put it on. Over there, put it on. Stand proud! Stand tall. Put your chest out. Pump it up... like you're some sort of rooster! Bantam rooster. Proud! Stand tall! More.

Nice chunky bit of meat. Break it out. Try that. It's lovely. You know what? These are blue swimmers. Beautiful. Blue swimmers. Crabs don't swim. - 'Course they swim. They walk on the bottom of the shore. How do you reckon they get to the bottom? They walk on the sand into the water. No, they swim. So you're saying we're eating fish. Yeah, something like that. Crabs swim. - Crabs don't swim. They live in the ocean. Crabs swim. They walk from the sand into the water. - There you go. Right there. How can they swim? They don't have fins, they don't have tails. Well... - Have you ever seen a crab float by? I didn't say crabs float... I said they swim. These are blue swimmer crabs. They're not even blue. No, they cook. You'd turn red if you cooked too. They're steamed. They cook. - I'm cooking. Oh, God. Crabs swim. You want one, buddy? and in joyful strains then let us sing advance Australia fair Hey! What? Are you the retarded? Right, this is how it goes. Heads, you're in the front. Tails, you're in the back. You're in the front. Aren't you gonna eat? Now, why pay good money for something you're just gonna shit out? You sure? I mean, I'm paying for it. I'll just have a coffee. Coffee's good. My money's gone. Hey, come here. If it was my decision... I'd do battle with you all day... but according to their rules... they reckon... that you're too young to handle a gun. Okay, so I'm gonna have to rely on you... to entertain yourself today. Okay? - Okay. All right. Just wander around a bit. Hey, just wander around a bit. You'll find some stuff to get in to. There'll be some V.C. roads. Some search-and-kill scenarios. So... take that blade. Take that blade. Wander around. Hack some shit up. Okay. - Entertain yourself. You know what? That's better than no weapon at all. Yeah. Good boy. I'll be general Custer. A bunch of white motherfuckers around here. ...going in there all the time, and the dog? The dog... The dog... - There's a small little dog. He'd cut the sweet breads... out of what he was killing... out of the kill and he'd put 'em in the sterilizer. So when you dip your knife in the sterilizer... it'd come up an have these sweet breads on it... and they really stink. They're horrible. And then, at smoko time, he'd take 'em out... and he'd empty 'em on a piece of plastic... and take 'em down, put 'em on the smoko table... cover 'em with salt, and go: Hey, not bad. Hey, Cuz? And I thought I'd nearly fucking vomit... every day when he was doing it. So, one day... I was doing this job they call ass-gutting... and I was working on the... on the sheep. And they're on the rail, coming through... and when you're ass-gutting what you gotta do is... you got your fingers like that... and you stick one finger in their ass... and you stick your thumb in their cunt... and you pull it up... All right, look, play. Hey, any rewards on dead mice? Did you kill one? - No, it was already dead. We're they friendly mice? No, they weren't friendly. - Let me see. Let me see, mate. Take that, commie rat! I sent them up there too, though. Fucking rice niggers. We can use one of his smokes to blow up something. Tell Rudy to come back here. Just keep an eye out on that way. Make sure you come back. Roger that. We'll load the weapons and ammo in place. Mark the area for the engineers. Roger that last contact. Snake bite one was overrun in combat, ineffective. Over. Roger. We're in route with their last known pause at this time. Over. You fucking maggot. You just left with one shot? Weapon jammed. Shit. - I got one of 'em. I'm hit. Cover me. Clear up. They didn't know you were surrendering? Had to disassemble this gun and oil it. Where's my fucking gun? Get down. You're hit. Get down. Get down. You're fucking hit! Get down! Help! Help! Help!
