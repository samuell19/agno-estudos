"The Beautiful Person" What? In English, please. What do you intend to do? Well, Miss Fancy School, not very chatty today? Why did you change schools? Didn't they want you any more? Or you weren't up to scratch? You okay? Junie! Forget it. I warned you; He's a real dick. Just don't show him you're upset. I'll introduce you. Henri, Junie, my cousin. That's Otto in the scarf. Sorry for the welcome. And that's Jacob. Hello. I'm Marie, sister of that pretentious cretin. And lastly, Catherine. You don't have to remember my name. If there's one name you should retain, it's Catherine's. Him and his water! I know. Henri, you and your damn water! Yes, I had a great night too, Nicole, and it's thanks to you. Sandrin, don't bump the girls, please. Henri IV just let you go? They can't make you stay. Are courses better there? I'll let you know in a week. Okay. Kids, smoking's banned now, you know! Come on, Nicole. Chill out. Talk to the hand; The face ain't listening. Couldn't you have stayed at Henri IV and live at home? Yes. I'd made my mind up. I had my reasons. Maybe, but you weren't expecting this. Chocolate's up. Don't worry. She knows all about us. She even doesn't mind Henri's hair. Showing off in front of your cousin? Buy me a coffee instead. Leave him alone. As if you never show off. You told them you're not going to Italy yet? What's that shit? Our dear parents said I mustn't cost them money. That's not exactly it, Henri. Well, that's the official version. Why didn't you tell me? Because I love you, my angel. The people were shocked, and Luther was excommunicated in 1520. He spread his ideas in Germany through printing, notably, the idea that salvation doesn't depend on charity. Don't even think about it. She's mine. He went on to condemn indulgences. These are remissions for punishments sold by the Church to the faithful to shorten their time in purgatory. This money went to fund the construction of St. Peter's in Rome. Other movements spread in Europe. Zwingli preached Protestantism in Switzerland. Calvin led the Reformed Church in Geneva. He put forward the theory of predestination: God chooses those who go to heaven, and the individual can't change anything. What a crock of shit. If you don't mind, Henri, please make your comments constructive. I appreciate strong views, but let's say there are at least two ways to see everything, and no one can know the whole truth. Point taken? Good. Let's continue. Madame. Excuse me. Are you married? No. But you have a boyfriend? Yes, but what's it to you? Do you love him deeply? Yes, deeply. And you've never imagined that you could just as well hate him? No. Well, if that's really the case, can we stop with all the bullshit about two ways of seeing everything? That little jerk is much too clever and much too sexy. I'd like to bring him down a peg. - You lied to him. - Sorry! Mind my head. What? You should have admitted it. You can both love and hate at once. If only I could. Don't make me prove you can. Go ahead and try, young man. But be careful. I could hurt you without hating you. Florence. Does that mean they know? They know about us? That a problem? I'd rather not. I'd rather they didn't. In that case, tell them yourself that it's not you I love deeply. Valois. Not you, your sister. What an idiot. Tell me. You haven't said anything about me to Henri, have you? Like what? What I told you about Miss Perrin, and about us too. Of course. I told him everything. What do you expect? I'm class rep. If you do that, bitch, it's over between us. Okay. Do you understand me? Ciao, bello ragazzi. Eh, cretino, come va? Muy bien. Un poooo del culo? Sempre. E tutti va bene la mama pasta et tutti quanti. Go do your math, my friend. Yes, the mathematico. Aspetta! Aspetta what? I don't know. Aspetta means "wait." - Hello. - Hello. Avanti, popolo The math teacher is back. Well, then, we're cool. Are you going to skip math too? No, we're going. I want you to know I'm screwing Mathias. Does Henri know? No, of course not. That's why I'm telling you. Mathias is worried you'll find out. He wants to protect you, and that bugs me, see? I want to carry on seeing him. Well, now you know. I'm trusting you, and if you betray me, watch out. Do we have to do that now? It has to be done for tomorrow, or else you won't be in it. Does that matter? Take that off. You'll see. Jacob's very talented. Isn't this a bit much for her first day'? It's okay. My cousin's not that delicate. We need to talk. What about? We'll be right back. Wait. Stop giggling. Look at me. Towards me, a bit more. Don't move. Stay like that. You have such fair skin. Okay, good. That's it. Let's go. I'm not done. Too bad, Cartier-Bresson. You won't have enough light. Wait! One without the sweater. Bye-bye. Come on. Let's pack up. I'm not coming with you tonight. Fine. No questions asked. I want to tell her something. Are you always so perfect? What do you mean? Nothing. How about we do some more photos? I've some great kit at my place. Have you seen Mathias? He's over there Thanks. Excuse me. I forgot your name. It's Jeanne. Okay. Thanks, Jeanne. Hey, Otto. Hi. What's up? My mom works up here, you know. Yes, you said. I'm going to meet her. Well, we're nearly there. How about we go for a coffee? Sorry. I'd better get home. I have stuff to do. Yes, but you can't go home ahead. When I get in, they'll kill me. Doesn't matter. I'll just... We'll do it tomorrow. I'll just leave you a sec. I have to buy bread. I promised Mom I'd buy some bread. - See you in a minute. - Okay. You okay? That's nice. You're not worn out? They didn't drive you mad? I warn you. I'm quieter. - Really? - Yes. I like to have fun, but within limits. My name's Otto, by the way. Yes, I know. You said it this morning. You might have forgotten. I didn't forget. Junie. That's pretty. It's in Racine, Neron's tormentor. Yes, and fleeing him ends badly for her. She kills herself, no? No, she takes the vows. And as a nun, she can no longer marry. I don't think there's a story with my name in it. - There is. - I don't think so. Yes, I'm sure there's an Otto in a novel. Maybe in a kids' book. The story of a rabbit called Otto with burrow problems. Maybe. Talking literature? That's right. Well, I'm off. Enjoy your baguette. Bye. So did he tell you? What? He wants to go out with you. Are you nuts? He's such a drip. Leave him alone. Henri. Hey, guys. Hi, Junie, how are you? What's up with her? She buried her mother a week ago. And what about Otto? I think it's off to a bad start. Your turn, Jacob So, Jacob... Absolutely. Yes, absolutely. Can you explain to us your workings? Uh, yeah. So... we stated U(x) equals O/x and v(x) equals exponential of -'I, -'x The derivative of the function equals the product of the two functions and the derivative of a function product. Henri, do you mind? Concentrate. So we'll have to calculate U'(x) and V'(x). "The virgin, vivid and beautiful today, "will it rend for us with its drunken wing this hard, forgotten lake that haunts 'heath the frost..." "What have I done to you?" "A swan of old remembers that it is he, "magnificent but without hope of freeing himself for not having sung of the land..." Pass it to Junie. "In the radiant boredom of winter's sterility, "his whole neck will shake off this white agony "by space inflicted on the stubborn bird "whose feathers are caught in this soiling mud. "A phantom, a scorching pure whiteness, "it stills in a cold, scornful dream. How futile is exile for the swan." Would you take over, please, Mathias? "You idiot! That's it. You haven't done anything!" "A swan of old remembers that it is he, "magnificent but without hope of freeing himself "for not having sung of the land "in the radiant boredom of winter's sterility. His whole neck will shake off this white agony." For next time, please revise the chapter on humanism. Go on. It's now or never. Go for it. I don't know what to say to her. You look her in the eye and tell her you love her. Isn't that a bit dumb? How do I kiss her? You don't deserve her. I'm giving her to Jacob Go on. Do it. You're mean. He's going to get a slap. What are you looking at? I love you, Junie, from when I saw you. That's the way it is. Is that just to have me? Not at all. I pledge myself to you. Then don't let me down and look after me... always. Come in. You're late, young lady. Where shall I sit? Mr. Nemours, this is Junie DE Chartres, Mathias' cousin. Hello. Come and sit next to me. The libretto of Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor is an adaptation from Walter Scott. Anyone know Walter Scott? Quentin Durward; Ivanhoe. That'll do. Move on, please. It's based on a 17th-century Scots story. Can you slow down a bit, please? Enrico, Lucia di Lammermoor's brother, wants her to marry Arturo. It's a marriage of convenience, like many of the time. But Lucia refuses because she's in love with another. He's Edgardo, and the two have vowed fidelity. Enrico tells her Edgardo is cheating so that she accepts the marriage. On her wedding night, she kills her husband in a fit of rage. This is the passage I'll play. It's a magnificent duo with flute when the girl goes mad with despair. How does it end? The usual. Lucia dies, and Edgardo kills himself. Ready? It dolce suono, mi colpi di sua voce. Try not to use the French translation. Use the Italian text. I've chosen Callas. Are you okay? Excuse me. Let's carry on. She moved in at my parents' a week ago. What about her dad? That's another matter. But she's getting on all right, in fact. Does she want to come on the trip? I don't know. I haven't asked. I wanted to ask you. If there's more of us, is it cheaper? No, if there's more, then we need another teacher. The secretary doesn't want that. She left her school things. Can you give them back to her? Yes. There's only of 16 us. Henri's not coming. Why not? That's bad if we're only 16. There has to be 20 of us. If we're down to 16, it's off. Unless we invite others. We could open it up to Latin students. No. There's 40 in the class. How could I pick just four? I was thinking... Could you think outside? Why don't we organize a soccer match between teachers and students? I don't think so. Or an inter-class table-tennis tournament? Not that. We'll invite the parents... I'm going to... I'll tell you You're going to convince your cousin. Then we'll be 17, okay? We can do our French project together. I can't work as a pair. Shall we go? - Shall we go? - Yeah. Ciao, dude. Bye, Junie. See you tomorrow. I don't get it. You spend all day kissing him, then you get rid of him. Junie? Junie, stop being such a bitch. Don't give Otto the runaround. I'm sure he's sincere. You're giving me sincerity lessons? Save it for Esther and Catherine. Otto's different. So are you. At least I hope so. And what about you? I do the best I can. You've kissed now. That means something. I know, but it's as if... she only does it not to hurt me, as if she pities me. You always exaggerate. Aren't you happy to have her? I don't see how she can love me. Give her a little time. Why didn't she fall for me at first sight? Easy on the romanticism. Call me tonight if you need to. Ciao, big kiss. Jacques! Jacques. Why are you here? Guess. Can I come up? No. I want our relationship to end here. Is it Miss Perrin? No, it's got nothing to do with Florence. You've made your mind up, and I have to keep my mouth shut? See? You're already starting to go on about it. I don't want to talk. Please, just leave it. You're ashamed of me. That's the truth. You're ashamed. No, I'm not ashamed. I just want our relationship to stop here. I'm breaking it off. Four quick fucks. You call that a relationship? Fine then. You screwed a teacher. Why are you lying to me? Why not say there's someone else? Who's next in line? Go on. Go home. It's late. I'm tired. I'm not homeless. Go on. It doesn't mean we have to be enemies, okay? What do I tell the others? They'll think I made it all up. I wouldn't worry about that. Do you know that joke: "Even a stopped clock is right twice a day"? No. And I'm not sure I get the joke It's silly, but it's very painful to leave you, sir. Come on. Make a bit of space. You should go shopping. It's no good eating junk every night. You're right. Next time I'll do that. Is that the new one? Yes. Pretty girl, huh? Very... She looks sweet. Junie, isn't it? Yes. She left that in my class, so... You're going to give it back, I hope. No, I'm not. Watch it. I've got my eye on you. Young girls ought to be respected. Loving them isn't disrespecting them. You know very well what I mean. No. You know very well what I mean. They're fragile as glass at that age. I get it. You're just jealous. You want me to have a photo of you. I haven't aroused desires in years. Why's that? Go and sit down. I'm sure you have secret loves. Go and sit down. Go on. I haven't been French-kissed in years. Now do you get it? Hello. Hello. Can I see? Yes, of course. Jacob, can you do me a print? I gave one to Junie. You'll have to ask her if she minds. Thanks. Otto? You have 17 books overdue. I know. And did you know you're therefore undesirable in this library? Yes. I'll bring them back tomorrow. Yes, do. Good-bye. So, Jacob... Will you hold the ladder for me? Mathias. Mathias. You don't want to give it to me? Or have you already given it away? Or you're keeping it to admire yourself? I lost the photo. Is that the truth? Yes. Did someone steal it? I don't know. I find that woman beautiful. Very dignified. Me too. She has always impressed me. And I've heard a few tales about her. My aunt knows her through mutual friends. She told me a funny story. Want to hear it? Tell me. She married young to this man, and they had a child. The man got killed somehow before the child was born. I think he got murdered. Everyone was sorry for her. She was already at the school. Everyone thought she was brave. One day, a new sport teacher arrived, Sancerre. He's left now. He fell for her, and she welcomed it. But because of her child, she didn't let him come home. And in school, she kept it a secret. This went on for months. The funny thing was that everyone thought she was a heartbroken widow when, in fact, she had this liaison. Then one day Estouteville... The math teacher? The math teacher, a friend of Sancerre. So Estouteville confides in Sancerre. He tells him that for the past six months, he's had a secret love affair. Sancerre wanted to know who with. After making him swear to secrecy, Estouteville confessed that it was Madame Tournon. You never really know people, even those you love. Any chance that I could interest you? I'll be right back. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. I wanted to say sorry for last time. I wanted to ask you something. Yes? When I left my notebook on the table, did I drop a photo? A photo? A photo of what? A photo of me. No, I don't think so. Doesn't matter. Well, better go in, then. Hello. What's going on? There's only 15 now for the Italy trip. Well, then it's off. Who's not coming? We'll just have to cancel. Thanks very much. The secretary will think I'm an idiot. Junie, hand out the photocopies please. Junie, can you start reading, please? "lo canto al ritmo del dolce tuo respiro "e primavera, sara perche ti amo. "Cede una stella, ma dimmi dove siamo. Che re ne frega, sara perche ti amo ll E vola, vola sf Sempre piu in alto si va e vola, vola con me ll mondo e matto perche. E se I'amore non c'e basta una sola canzone per far confusione fuori e dentro di te. Grazie. Does that make you think of anything? Nothing at all? It's part of our series on Italian pop songs. No one has any idea? Shall I sing it for you? Never mind. I see you're being humiliating today. Clever bunch. Junie, start the translation, please. "I sing to the rhythm of your sweet breath. It s spring "It's because I love you. A star falls down "but tell me where we are. "What do you care? "It's because I love you. "And fly, fly away. "Always higher we go. "And fly, fly with me. "The world is crazy because, "and if there is no love, "all it takes is one song to spread confusion around and inside you." Hello. Here. Thanks. Is it working today? It only works with francs. That's a shame. A special one for you, miss. But I warn you, it's not modern. Nice, isn't it? She was so pretty That I didn't dare love her She was so pretty I can't forget her She was that pretty When the wind took her away She fled in rapture And the wind whispered to me She's much too pretty And I know you too well You could never love her A whole life through But then she left It's crazy, yet it's true She was so pretty I'll never forget her Go on. Tell me. I don't know what to say. I don't want to moralize. Go on. Say it anyway. In any case, you should be careful. She seems a bit crazy. You think so? Always in control and yet so vibrant. That sort of scares me. That's because she's... Sensitive? No, she's fragile. I don't think that girl's fragile. You can see she's a tough one. You shouldn't fool around with students. It's too easy. It's not easy with her. You've got no idea. Is it over with Florence? Yes, it's over. Over with Florence, over with the others Clean sweep. I'm in a total lovesick mess. I feel so ridiculous. I'm just head-over-heels in love. It's completely stupid. It's been such a long time since I fell in love. I haven't felt this for ages. You know, your stomach all knotted up, your chest on fire, your legs weak. I know I've got to calm down, get a grip, but I can't. I just can't. Sorry for pouring all this out on you. But I can't talk about anything else. Want to change the subject? No, no, no, carry on. It's fine. I don't want to whine on. That girl will never love me. She'll never love me. I'm lying to myself too. She can't not love me. You seem more disappointed in love than in the grip of love at first sight. Maybe. Nicole! Yes? We need some shots. Vodka? Dubrovka? There's Patrick. He's here all day. How's it going, Patrick? Here you go: Dubrovka. Good health. Spasiba. Cheers. Bottoms up. That's it. I don't want to embarrass you. Let's get drunk. We'll work it out later. Embrace you? Embrace me? You want to embrace me? What? Oh, embrace you? That's what you said. No, I said embarrass you. "Long live Tibo and his wife!" Look, Koudi. She's not a responsible woman. Let's go! Do you think they saw us? Sooner or later, everyone will know. Come on. What a life! Jeanne, can I talk to you? Have you got Nemours' letter? Yes. Can I have it? Here. Have many people read it? You bet. They were all over it. Careful. There's Nemours. Don't forget to give it back to Marie. She found it. "I love you too much to let you think I can live without you. "I don't care if you cheat on me, "as long as you are honest and tell me. "I don't care if you hide me away, "as long as you come find me again. "I am patient, and while I await you, "I will recall your whole body. I'm even in love with your knees." There's no point looking. She's not here. She's a big girl. She won't get lost. This is absurd. Where is she? Have you read Nemours' letter? What letter? Marie found it. It fell out of his pocket. He's such a heartbreaker, Nemours. What are you waiting for? Where's Marie? You're not going to wait for Junie? Florence! I'll stay here. Marie! Marie. Marie. Have you got Nemours' letter? No, and I don't really want to talk about it. What did you do with it? I gave it to Jacob. He should have it. He just told me you had it. Well, I haven't, so drop it. Do you think Henri's got it? No idea. You're starting to piss me off! Mathias, you stay here. I'll wait for my cousin with Mr. Nemours. What are you doing here? I just saw Marie. She said you've got the letter. No, I gave it back. You sure? No. I don't know. Be discreet. He's right there. Jeanne had it. Anyone seen her? I haven't. She got a mobile? No, she doesn't want a mobile. Think she got the wrong station? Can I talk to you, sir? Yes. It's personal. Don't worry about my cousin. She knows Paris. She's not lost. What's on your mind? Everyone thinks you lost a letter in the cinema. Really? I lost a letter? Marie found a letter, and she thinks it fell out of your pocket. In fact, it belongs to me. And it's really very private. Sir, I'm going to need your help here. Okay. Take it easy. We'll find Junie, then we'll deal with the letter. I'm asking a real big favor here. I'll do it. Don't worry. You have to ask Marie for the letter back, saying it's yours. What does this letter say? It's a love letter, sir. Are you kidding? What the fuck's going on? Marie can't know the letter's mine, and she can't tell Henri. What's Henri got to do with this? It started as a game, then became more serious, especially for Henri. I realized he was in love. Then I met Martin. We saw each other in secret, between lessons, at lunchtimes. We couldn't live without each other. I never thought he'd do that. He threatened us. He told us if we carried on, he'd put the photo on the school website. Run along. I'll take care of your cousin. Thank you, sir. No problem. Where's he going? He's not waiting with us? We've been here an hour! Why did you wait for me? I need a bit of space, Otto. Leave me alone. Wait a second. I have to talk to Junie privately about her cousin. Is Mathias okay? Give us a moment. Mathias is upset over a letter. Do you know anything about it? Yes, but what's it to him? It concerns him because the letter belongs to him. I don't think so. It fell out of your pocket. Did you see it fall? No. Whoever told you that is wrong. The letter belongs to Mathias, it matters to him, and he needs it back. Fine. Why are you getting involved? I'm not getting involved; I'm just... That letter isn't mine, but I'm going to pretend it is for your cousin. I want you to know that. Do you believe me? It's not me you have to convince. Marie found the letter on your chair. She'd better not tell Nemours. If she says a word, I'll kill Marie. Do you have any proof it's not yours? I can't reveal Mathias' secrets. There are no secrets between Mathias and me. It's from a guy called Martin. I haven't even read it. I've read the letter. It's from a woman. Are you sure about that? "I don't care if you hide me away, "as long as you come find me again. "I am patient, and while I await you, "I will recall your whole body. I'm even in love with your knees." Do you believe me now? Can I have the letter, please? I tore it up. But if you don't give it to Marie, she'll smell a rat. Do you recall the letter? Write it yourself. Martin gave it me just before the film. I read it quickly. I remember what it says, more or less anyway. It wasn't a long letter. That's great! You can rewrite it. A girl's handwriting is better. Tomorrow you give it to Marie. This is ridiculous. I don't think saving my skin is ridiculous. What was this letter written on? What kind of paper? Ordinary white paper. I've got some. Let's do it now. Come and sit down. Come on. Paper. Pen. You don't mind writing a love letter to me? "I love you too much to let you think I can live without you." "My love, I beg you, don't leave me." Oh, no. Don't joke around It's already bad enough for Martin. One can be a little lyrical. I'd rather we keep it as near to true as we can. What's next? How long have you been together? Since October the 12th. You're the only person who knows. I think Esther knows. She's got no idea. You don't mind when he's with her? Yes, of course. But if Mathias wanted us to be open, I'd feel uneasy about that too. I couldn't hide away all the time. You're lucky, because Otto's a real saint. I've gotta go. My brother's waiting for me at judo. Will you call? Yeah. I'm sick of this. What's up? I don't know. I'm not going to Italian. Will you stay with me? Sure. You give the orders; I follow on. Where will you go for now? Maybe to my dad's, if he'll have me. Or there's my aunt in Brittany. I don't get why you want to leave. You were just settling in. Why run off so soon? I went too fast. I know it. I thought going to a new school was the right thing after Mom died. I overestimated myself. Mathias' folks will let you go? I think so. How long will you be gone? I don't know. I might come back after the holidays. Don't take it personally. Of course I take it personally. Your leaving means I didn't help you. You're the only one who helps me. Not enough, because you're leaving me. I'm not leaving, just distancing. Honest, it's better that way. Can't you tell me why? I just explained. I want the truth, or I can't fight back. What's happened to you? Should I make a useless confession? What does that mean? Junie, what does that mean? Tell me. I'd rather know than imagine. You promised not to lie, so don't lie. Junie. I'm going away to protect myself from someone here. The truth is, I'm fleeing. Someone you're in love with? Someone I don't want to love. You've fallen in love with someone else? No, the opposite. I'm going away to not fall in love. I respect you, Otto. I'm telling you that because I care for you. You care for me but love another. That'll pass. I just have to go away for a while. Who is it? You can't force me to say. I want to know. Must be someone special if you're going to ruin your year for them. I admitted there was someone because I don't want to hide things like the others. But I can't tell you who. Has this boy said that he loves you? No, but I understood he does in other ways. Does he know we're together? If we still are. If I didn't want to be with you, I'd have left without a word. Sir! Henri and Mathias are fighting. We can't break it up. Hey! What's going on? You're going to have a few bruises. Stop it now! Are you insane? Give me your bag, dear. I'm fine, Mom. Margot! Will he get out? Yes, they're not going to hold him. Good-bye. Henri. Thank you. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter. Thanks. Bye. Otto. I can understand. Even if I can't, he leaves me no choice. I hate that he lied to me for months. At least he could have told me. It wasn't that easy for him. Perhaps he was a bit mixed up. I'd like to help him, but he refuses. Did he say he doesn't want to see you? Yes. He says it's for the best, to not suffer. He's afraid the others will mock me because of Martin. He wants to deal with it alone. You have to give him some time. I can't even be jealous. He doesn't love him. He can't love him. Anyway, you didn't see Mathias all that often. You don't have to be joined at the hip. Shit, I ought to hate him, but the only thing I feel is afraid, afraid for him. I'm always afraid. For me, it was true love. Did you tell him? No. He forbid me. He said it was mawkish. Hello. I was looking for you. How is Mathias? He talked to Esther. What did he say to her? He told her he loves Martin. There you go. The little lad's being brave again. Brave and selfish. He doesn't give a damn how Esther feels. He's just relieved Having the courage of your convictions isn't always easy. Would you mind leaving me alone? If you don't mind. No. You not with Junie? She got stuck in the cafe with Nemours. Are you okay? Yeah. Hello. What do you want? I came to find you. What for? Haven't you got Russian at 2:00? Yes. Don't you have Italian at 2:00? I'm not going. Why not? I just don't want to. Have you got anything to tell me? No. What do you expect me to say? Go on. It starts in five minutes. See you later. Listen. Junie's in the courtyard. So? She's outside, not in Italian. Can you spy on her? What do you think she's up to? No questions asked, please. It'll cost you. Drop it, doesn't matter. Excuse me, can I leave the room? Does that mean yes? Thank you. Take out your Pasternak texts. We can't go on like this. I'm as lost as you are. So did you see her? Who was she with? What was she doing with Nemours? They were kissing? You come with me, then say nothing. I'm waiting for you to speak. Don't start with that, please. When do you go to your dad's? I can't go to my dad's. And it would be mean to leave Mathias. It wasn't mean kissing Nemours? Are you mad? I didn't kiss Nemours. I'd never kiss him! You were seen. No one can have seen us. You've got good hiding places. I beg you, don't accuse me of something I haven't done. I thought you were different. But you're the same as Marie, except Marie doesn't act superior. Sometimes we lack the rain The storm gathers more pace To cry out in our pain These words throw in your face Sometimes we lack the rain As in the sun we die From its heat we refrain When love has gone away Sometimes we strive in vain To fight I would prefer To beat her, give her pain So no one would want her Sometimes we strive in vain Our arms they do betray When love we would retain Like sand, just slips away Sometimes sobs we contain Yet out pours have more class A few tears would explain But that's too much, alas Sometimes sobs we contain Sometimes the day's a strain The nights better express Stars like crosses do ordain A sky in mourning just for us Sometimes the day's a strain The night is long to come When it falls, you feel the pain Of every starry dome Good night. Be strong. Mathias, Junie hasn't been in class for three weeks. I'm aware of that. I haven't said anything yet to the secretary, but... You understand? I can't pretend nothing's going on. Could you persuade her? I'll try. Tell her I won't be here Monday. I'm taking sick leave to the end of year. Because you're sick? I'd like everyone to introduce themselves. What's your name? My name is Antonio. - And you? - Martin. Okay. And you? I'm Emilie. And what's your name? My name is Junie. Delighted to meet you. - And you? - Clement. Go on. I'll catch up. Okay? You wanted to talk to me? I'm sorry for acting like this. I feel so pathetic doing this, but I have to talk to you. Otherwise, I'll go mad. That's fine, but don't expect anything. I'm not ashamed to talk frankly. I thought that's one thing you liked about me, my openness. Imagining you could no longer love me is far worse for me than what you call "the rules" I set for myself. I know we're two people, and so like anyone, we could be together. But for how long? If we're two ordinary people, how long will our love last? Eternal love doesn't exist, not even in books. So loving means for a finite time. There'd be no miracle for us. We're no different to anyone else. Otto is the only man who'll love me all his life. It sounds dumb, but it's almost true. If I give myself to you, you'll go off. You don't trust me much, then. I'm not a fool. You're handsome. Everyone likes you. You've known a lot of women. I've met at least two of them. As with them, one day you'll leave to love another that you find more pleasing. And I won't survive. Not to mention the jealousy. The state that letter put me in. I'd always think you're loved by, and in love with, another. Perhaps I'd be able to endure my sadness. Others do. It won't work, Junie. You can't hold out alone against our love, because I am armed... And I'm not going to let you do it. See you tomorrow? No. Not tomorrow, the next day. Come round if you like. 5:00'? Mathias, it's Nemours. I'm outside. I was meeting Junie at 5:00. It's nearly 7:00. I didn't see you come home. I'm worried. Call me when you get this message. Hello. Hello, Mathias. My mom didn't let me come today. Junie left yesterday afternoon. Where did she go? I can't tell you. She's gone far away. You shouldn't wait for her. She said not to pass on any news, that she never wants to hear from you again Thank you. Go in. You'll catch a cold.
