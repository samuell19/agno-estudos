(ethereal music) - [Radio Announcer] Smith to Williams out to the three, no good. Pervis rebounds, lay-up, no good, no foul. Rebounded by Grant. That was a good call by the officials. Oregon State back down on the floor, this has been a 12 two run by Louisville. It's a close one. Back to Grant, Pervis gets his hands on it. Ball on the floor, out of bounds off the leg of Grant from Oregon State. With 4:32 to go, Louisville has the ball. Ellison passes to Spencer over to Smith back to Ellison. He shoots and the three is good. Louisville gets the lead. (gasping in pain) - Uh, just keep breathing. Doing great. - I am breathing! - [Radio Announcer] Ooh, Ellison steals the ball from Payton passes to Payne and it's up and in. - Yeah, that's right! - Patrick! - What? - Could you please just drive! - I'm driving! I'm telling you baby, one day that's gonna be our boy out there, fans screaming. - Patrick! (horn blares) (gasping) You said he was gonna be a big football star. - That too. He's gonna take that field. (groans) Just, yeah. Yeah. - [Radio Announcer] The three is good! Never nervous Pervis answers Oregon's call. There's a time out on the floor. - Keep breathing, we're almost there, okay? - Hey honey, you're doing great. - If you want to just wait here we'll get you when she's ready. - Okay. - Hi, sweetheart! Good luck! How is she? - The doctors say she's doing great. - Good, good, good, good. - Keep pushing, keep pushing! (yells) (panting) (grunting) (emotional music) (baby cries) - [Doctor] You have a son. - Patrick Henry Hughes. (knocks) - How's Mama doing? - She's good, they both are. The doctors are just running their tests. - Sure are a lot of nurses in there. - Ah, you gotta be careful nowadays. Avoid all those crazy lawsuits. - Well I'm sure he's fine, honey. - Good looking son you got there. - Yeah. Yeah, he sure is. Grandpa. (chuckling) (sighs) - We discovered some anomalies. - What do you mean, anomalies? - Patrick Henry was born with a rare condition. It's called bilateral anophthalmia. He was born without eyes. - What? - There must be some... - The ultrasound said that he was healthy. - I'm sorry. It's easily missed. I'm afraid there's more. We think Patrick was born with some sort of dwarfism. His joints didn't form properly. With surgery, he should be able to walk. (crying) But he still will have limited mobility. I'm very sorry. I'll give you all some time. (crying) (baby fusses) (phone rings) - Histologic examination showed us there's an absence of neuroectodermal tissue. - Mhmm. - Now listen to this. In most cases, a prosthetic eyeball is needed to prevent facial dysmorphism. I mean, this medical book is 353 pages long and I can barely find three pages on his condition. And all the doctors have an opinion, but they're never for sure. They never know for sure. I mean, look at him! Those braces are like some sort of medieval torture device. - I don't know, Patricia. He... - Do you see this? The doctor showed me what we have to do. We have to pry this into his eye socket to open it up, his socket. And then we have to pry this one in, and then this one. - Okay, look. It's better that we're doing all this now, right? - The doctor said that his eyes will bleed as we force these into his skull. There's more surgeries, severe bruising. I mean, it's torture! - I don't know what to tell you. I'm not a doctor. (kettle whistles) Oh man, I gotta go. Look, it's gonna be okay. (baby cries) - Shh. - Here we go. Here it is, here it is. - Nice! (clapping) - Come on, daddio. You're gonna be tying a lot more shoelaces and wiping a lot more noses. - Nah, Patricia does most of that. I try not to get my hands too dirty. - I heard about Patrick Henry. I'm sorry, man. He's special needs? I'm just saying, it's gotta be rough. - No, he's gonna come around. I mean, the doctors just haven't figured out how to fix him yet, you know? (horn blares) (phone rings) - Mommy, what's wrong with him? - No, it's a motorcycle. (knocking) Hi. - How are you guys? - Good, good, yeah, good. - Great to hear. I'm sorry it took so long to get back to you. - Hey, conference room? We need to go over this proposal. - Yes sir. (phone rings) - Thank you. I tried calling you five times today. - Okay? Sorry, I was busy. - You expect me to believe you were out of the office that much? - It was a really busy day, so yeah, I kinda do. Honey, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to make you upset, it's just... (crying) Baby, I'm sorry. - He's never... He's never gonna walk. - What? - Dr. Rogers said he's sorry, but... - No, no. Wait a minute, what about the surgery? They said they could fix his hips. If they just put his hips back in the sockets or whatever. - He said it wouldn't work. He said it was not... - So that's it. He'll never walk. - Maybe it's for the best. - I'm sorry, what? - I'm just saying, he's been through so much. Maybe it's best we stop trying to force him into what we think he should be. - Patricia, we are his parents. Shouldn't we be fighting for whatever is best for him? - Is this what's best for him? (scoffs) Just say it. - Just say what? - You're disappointed. - I'm dis-, yeah, yeah I'm very disappointed. Our son is never going to walk. - No, no, you are disappointed that you didn't get your big all star. And you're mad because he's not the kind of kid you can brag about to all your friends. Well, you know what? Patrick Henry may not be progressing like normal kids, and he may never be a star athlete or an astronaut or a brain surgeon, and maybe he'll never reach the lofty perch of being average. But I will tell you this. He will be everything that God meant him to be. But I need to know that you're with me. Because we're supposed to be a team and right now it's just me. - Oh, it's just you? Why do you think I spend all day every day at work? - I work too. You spend all your free time away from us. - You know what? No, I'm not gonna sit here and take this. I work to support this family. I want what is best for him and I am not gonna sit here and let you make me feel guilty. I'm fine. - No, Patrick, he needs you. And I need you. - Sweetheart, I know that. I'm right here. - It's seven o'clock. - Yeah, I've got a game in 30 minutes. - Mhmm, I know. - We'll finish talking about this later, then. (sniffs) (sighs) - I don't know, man. She's just so beautiful. I really think I love her. - Would you just ask her out already? - Ah, it's just-- - Come on man, women are not that scary. - Patrick? Can you come inside please? Okay, so his food is on the counter, here's his milk, and just don't forget to-- - Wait, what? - Girl's night? Now, don't forget to feed him around six. I laid his pajamas out on the bed and when you put him in the crib, just be careful with his-- Oh, okay. - And most importantly, just don't forget to change his bandages over his eyes before you put him to bed. - Fine, that's fine. - You good? - I got it. Have fun! (sighs) Come on, buddy. - Hand me a rag? - So, what do you know about babies? - Could we get some parmesan cheese? Thank you. - I'm worried. - Here, have some of this fettuccine. Honey, it is delicious. - I'm afraid he's going to burn the house down. - He'll be all right. Just be thankful you only have one kid. God never gives us more than we can handle. - I'm pregnant, Bev. - Trish, honey, that's great. Have you told him yet? - No, no. I'm scared of what he'll-- - What? - What if this baby has issues too? - Oh, Patricia, honey, everyone has issues. - You know what I mean. I would be blessed to have another Patrick Henry. I don't know if he can handle it. - What are you gonna do? - Oh, drive. - Oh, nice shot! Is he asleep? Oh, dude, was that you? - No, was it... (both groan) Okay, here we go. Here we go. Oh. - Oh, man! Ah, that ain't right. Ah, I'm out. - Oh come on, Mike. It's not that bad. - [Mike] I'm going bowling! - I hate you. (crying) Ow! - Ow. - Come on. Try this, oh. (sighs) Daddy's had about all he can take. It's time to go to bed. What? Bandages. (crying) Daddy's coming, buddy. (key plunks) (crying stops) You like that? (plays Fur Elise by Beethoven) - We need to talk. (sighs) Guess we're gonna have to put another crib in here. Look, I'm sorry. I know I dropped a lot on you last night. (plays xylophone) What are you thinking? - That you're right. He does look worse than Muhammad Ali. - Yeah, well, you should try seeing him like that every day. (plays xylophone) - You know, he may not be an athlete. But he loves music. You wanna play a little game with me? Play this game with me? Okay, all right. (plays note) (plays note that matches the pitch of the kettle's whistle) (plays note that matches the pitch of a car horn) (harmonizes with both pitches) (copies notes and rhythm) One two three. (copies notes) (emotional music) - Patrick? - You scared me, Dad. - What are you doing, buddy? - I got thirsty. Sorry, usually I can make it. - You want some help? - Yes. - [Cameron] Mom, I can't find my church shoes! - Well, I didn't wear them last. Patrick, there are two pancakes on the plate in front of you. - Great, thanks. - Mom! - Cameron, did you hear your mother? - How many do you want? - I'll take three. - Well, here's two. - Come on, I'm a growing boy. - Jesse, do we have to go through this every Sunday? Stripes and plaid do not go together, go change. - Yeah, Jesse. Stripes and plaids totally don't go together, duh. - Ouch, blind kid showing you up. - Patrick! - What? - Yes? - No, not you Patrick. Don't antagonize 'em, honey. - [Cameron] Found 'em! - Now Patrick Henry, have you figured out what you're going to play at the Crusade yet? - Not yet. I'm still working on my song. - Will the whole world see you on TV? - [Jesse] No, dumbo! - Jesse! - No, the Crusade for Children is still a really big deal. Most of the state will see you perform. - Better not screw up! - You're gonna do great. How's work coming? - I'm almost done. - Okay, we're ready to eat. - Great. - Let's say a prayer. - Right. Dear Lord. - Oh no, my eyes! - Patrick put your eyes back in your head! - Patrick Henry Hughes? - Yes? - I am so sorry. - Right this way, Mr. Patrick. - Something wrong with it? - No, just changing the oil. - Hey, you know Patrick really wants you to take him to the Crusade. Do you think you can take him? - Um, yeah. I need to shift some stuff around, but I can do that. - We went to the doctor today. - [Patrick] How was it? - It was, could you come out from under there, please? - Sure. - So, his scoliosis is getting worse. He's gonna need surgery. - Great. Our insurance will cover it, right? - Part of it, I don't know. I just don't know how much more I can bear seeing him go through this. - Patrick's a pro. What is this, like, his tenth surgery? - Eleventh. - He's gonna be fine. You need to stop worrying, all right? He's gonna be okay. (emotional music) I heard you get what you pray for One more time I got more yeah - Okay. - I have to follow up Pam Tillis? - Oh, it'll be fine. - Do you think they'd believe you if you said I passed out. - You're gonna be great. - Well thanks, but I'm still scared out of my mind. - Really? Mom said you weren't that nervous last night. - Yeah, well that was last night. - Just, you know, picture everybody in their underwear. - Dad. - You know what I mean, you know. Just... - Dad, it's okay, just stop. - Listen. Just think about you and me, in our living room, just the two of us, okay? - Okay. - Listen, you know, if you forget part of the song don't worry about it. I'll be backstage beside ya. I can whisper the line out to you. I've got all your lyrics right here. - Did Mom do that? - Yeah. - Well thanks. It's good to know you're there if I need you. - You won't. - How many people are out there, Dad? - I'm not telling you. It's just you and me, remember? - Are you Patrick? - Yes I am. - You're on in two minutes. Are you ready? - I, I guess so. How many people does this auditorium hold? - 825. Terry Meiners is introducing you. - The guy from the radio? - Yeah. - Wow. - Here we go. - Patrick Henry Hughes. It is so good to meet you. I've heard so much about you. - Hi. - He's a big fan. - Oh. - It's great to meet you. - Oh, you too. Is it your first time to perform-- - We gotta go, Pat, come on. - Oh hey, you'll be great. Just go out there and have fun. - Thank you. - Do good! - It's just you and me, buddy. (applause) - As you know, the Crusade for Children helps many kids all throughout the Kentuckiana area. Kids with all sorts of disabilities, or in the way Patrick Henry Hughes likes to put it, abilities. Tonight, Patrick Henry is here to share some of those very special abilities with you. Give it up for Patrick Henry Hughes. (applause) - Go Patrick! - Where is he? I don't see him. - Oh, they haven't cut to him yet. Oh there, there he is right there! Oh my gosh! - Okay, okay sh sh sh.

Doctor said everything went just like it was supposed to. - How're you feeling, sweetie? - Thirsty. - Sandy here should be able to get you some ice chips. Recovery's gonna take some time, but we'll just have to watch and make sure you're on your way to getting big and strong again, okay? - Sounds good. - All right. I'll be back to check on you later tonight. - Thank you, doctor. - Oh, oh, Granny wanted me to give you something. Feel that? - Mom, that's great. Is she here? - No, she's gonna come back later. You can thank them then. - And here is a whole bunch of extra batteries. That should keep you busy for, what? A couple hours? (knocking) - Patrick? We're gonna need to run a few more tests. Would you all mind giving us the room? - Yeah, of course. All right buddy, we'll be back. - Bye. - Bye. - Hey, are you good? - Yeah. - Great, 'cause I'll be back in a couple of hours, all right? - Where you going? - I've just got a few things to take care of. - I thought you got off work so you could be here. - I did, but I've still got stuff to do. - Really? - Yeah, I'll be back as quick as I can. I'm sorry. - Great. - I'll be back to check on you later. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. (plays note) - What are you doing? I thought you were supposed to go back to the hospital and be with Patrick! - Don't worry, my parents are watching him. - Listen, I know that you need your time, but if you haven't noticed your son is in the hospital. And your other sons are trying to pretend they live normal lives. Now I am trying to hold this family together and I can't. Not by myself. What is that? - I sold my car. - I'm sorry. - Everything's gonna be all right. Look I should get back to the hospital. I'm sure my dad's getting restless. It's okay. (marching band plays) - Where's that big knife? - It's in the utensil drawer where it always is. - Would you all please be quiet? I'm trying to record the band. - What? I can't hear you, where is it? - I'm back, got the eggs. - Sh! - Don't you think we're too big for Easter egg hunts? - Okay, if you're too old for candy. - You need some help? - Guys! Got it! - Good to finally have you home, Patrick. - Yeah, I certainly don't miss the hospital food. - Hey, when do we eat? - The ham's still gonna need another 30 minutes or so. - Hey, how about some fresh air? It's a beautiful day out there. - Oh yeah. - Come on, Cameron. - Let me on there! - No, I was here first. - Take it easy, boys! - Table is all set, anything else? - Oh, move, move, move, move, hot, hot, hot, hot! Well, that does look nice. - Yeah, it does. - Can you get everybody a napkin? (fire alarm beeps) - Oh no! - What? - Oh no! - Oh, oh no! No, no, not into the sink, not the sink! - Patrick. - I always hated sweet potatoes anyway? - I worked all day on that thing. I must have left it in the oven too long, darn it. - Ma, it'll be all right. - Yes, I'm all right. - [Jesse] Mom, Dad, help! - Dad, it... - What happened? - The swing. - The rope broke. - Dad, Dad, my leg, my back! - It's okay buddy. Just take it easy. Dad, you're all right? - Stay with Patrick. - Patrick, can you move your toes? - Think so. - What have you done? - Cameron, you shouldn't have told Granddad to put him on the swing! - How was this my fault? It just broke! - Quiet, everybody quiet! It was an accident. Patricia, please. Pull the van around front. Thank you. Okay, Patrick? Just hang in there. We're gonna try and move you, all right? - Okay. - Oh, you're home. How are you? - I'm sore. - You should see yourself, a big red fighting machine. - He has a compound fracture in his leg. He's gonna be in that cast for eight weeks. - Patrick, I am so sorry. - It's fine, Grandpa. - It was an accident, Dad. - I know, but-- - You know what? It's late, we're all tired. Let me give you a ride home. - No, I'll be okay. - Yeah? - I'll be okay. - I'm so sorry, honey. - How am I supposed to practice with this stupid battering ram? - Okay, all right, you ready? One, two, three. Careful, careful. - What am I gonna do? - Can't wait to see the bill for this little adventure. - I feel so bad for him. I mean, eight weeks really is a long time. - Yeah, but he'll be okay. - But he can't play piano with that cast. Honey, we should have been watching him closer. - We can't always protect him. When I was his age, I got beat up, scraped, bruised, the whole nine yards. I survived. - Did your parents know every doctor in town? 'Cause I think I do. - [Patrick] Mom, Dad, come here! - What's wrong? - Trumpet. - What? - I can play trumpet. - What are you talking about? - Well you guys are always saying how I shouldn't think about my disabilities, but my abilities, right? And I was thinking, I can't play violin or guitar because my arms are too short and I can't play piano right now because of my leg, but look, I can play trumpet. - Hey, you know what? That's great, but we've all had a really long day and we should probably focus on getting some sleep. - Mom, don't you see it's great? - We'll talk about it in the morning. But yes, I think it's great. - Okay, good. - We don't have a trumpet. - So, we will get one. - You guys do realize I can hear you. - Don't worry about it, Patrick. It'll work out, you just get some sleep. - Mom? - Yeah. - Quit worrying about me, I'm fine. I gotta get out there. How else am I gonna learn? - We just want to keep you safe. - Well I love you too, Mom. - Goodnight, sweetheart. - Goodnight, buddy. - Goodnight Dad. - And now we need to find the money for a trumpet. - I'll make some calls. - [Patrick] I can still hear you! (laughing) (phone rings) - Hey, Patrick. Those reports will be on my desk by Monday morning? - Yes sir, they will be. - Have a nice weekend. - You too. (phone rings) Hey buddy. - Hey. - So, your mom called some of our old college friends. It'll do for now. - Oh wow, thank you! - You're welcome. Now I can finally tell your granddad that my music major's paying off. Now when you're ready, when you blow into it, you're gonna want to keep your lips really tight, okay? - Okay. (trumpet splutters) - We'll work on that. Here we go! Oh and the pass is good! - I so had that. - Oh come on Dad, that was right to you. - He's getting old. - Hey now. Hey Jesse? Go grab the ladder from behind the garage. Let's fix that swing. (trumpet splutters) (sighs) - Trumpet, Dad? Really? - So put down one? - Right, relax your fingers. Relax. - Okay. - Good, okay, all right? (plays note) That's pretty good! (plays scale) Oh, he's at the 15, the 10, the five, touchdown! (plays along with fight song) - [All] Go Cards! - Why are you watching this game again? - It's a VHS classic. Oh, this is where coach throws his hat. (smashing, shattering) - Mom! - What in the? Ah, Patrick! - I'm fine, Mom, don't worry. - Well, it's more than I can say for this lamp! - Tomorrow's the big day. - Trust me, I know. - Hey, you try having your leg like this. (phones ringing) - Have a good one, guys. Hey guys, I'm home. - Dad, you're home early. - Oh, milkshakes. - Oh boy! - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - All right, I'll be back in a couple of hours. You're gonna get Jesse at four? - And Cameron at 3:40, I got it. - All right, I'll take this for the road. You guys have a good day. - [Patrick] Bye Mom! - Bye! Here, hold those for me. - Okay. - So, Mike's taking a book out of his book bag, I switch pens with him, and then Donovan who's all hunched over and, man that guy was old. He goes, everybody, hold up your pens, and then he starts shuffling around the room. Scanning from hand to hand with his beady little eyes. And then he comes up behind Mike and (claps) he smacks Mike on the back of the head so hard, gave him two weeks of jug. - What'd Mike say to you? - What are you kidding me? I didn't tell him. - You didn't tell him? Dad, you guys are friends. - Yes, and I would like to keep it that way. The point is, high school is actually a lot of fun, and you're gonna do fine. And you should be glad that the educational system has progressed since the 1970s. - No, I just can't wait to get this cast off my leg. - Yeah, ten o'clock, right? - Yep, ten a.m.. - Well I will be there. I look forward to watching them saw that huge thing off your leg. - Ow! - You okay? - Brain freeze! (phone ringing) - Good morning, sir. You wanted to see me? - Yes, please, shut the door. Take a seat. You're late. - Yes sir, I know, I was with Patrick this morning. - It's the second time this week. - Yes sir, it's just that I've been juggling a lot lately and-- - Maybe I'm not making myself clear. I need you here all day every day. Get your work done and please get your priorities straight. - Sir, I-- - Look, Patrick, I like you. Always have, but you're making me look bad. Now go and do the work that I hired you to do. - Yes sir. I understand. - Good. That'll be all. (phones ringing) - No I know, tell him I'm sorry, okay? Yeah all right, I'll see you later. - Your dad said he was-- - I know, I heard. - Hey, you're finally free of that big ugly cast! - Mhmm, I know. (motorcycle engine rumbles) - What are you smiling about? - Nothing. - What? - That just sounds so cool. What are you doing? - Just wait here, be right back. - Okay. - Hey you. I got a favor to ask. - Woo! (emotional music) - I guess it's inevitable. - It's just high school, Mom, I'll live. - I just hate to see my little boy grow up so fast. - I'm excited. It's gonna be fine. - You sound like your dad. - Hi, I'm Mr. Howard your vision teacher. You must be Patrick. - Hello, it's great to meet you. - It's great to meet you. You ready to go to class? - Yeah. - All right. - Oh, okay, well, you guys have a good day. - We will! Bye Mom. - Bye honey. - So I hear you like music. - Yes. (chatter) - I'm gonna go get some lunch. I'll be right back in a couple of minutes, okay? - Sounds good. - All right. - Hello. - Hey. So you're blind? - Well my eyeballs are glass, so yeah. Why are you waving your hand in front of my face? - Man, I thought you said you were blind. - I can hear your sleeve moving. - I mean, I guess it's cool to chill all day, and let other people do stuff for you. - I try and do what I can for myself. Everything's impossible until you try it. - Why don't you try to walk? (laughing) - Why don't you try and jump off a roof and fly like a superhero? (laughing) - What'd you say your name was again? - Patrick. - Well I'm Bryce. - It's nice to meet you, Bryce. - Nice to meet you, man. So I'll see you around? - Sounds great. - Cool. - Everything all right? - Oh yeah, everything's great. - Those guys were giving you some weird looks. - Bryce seemed nice. I guess I've never really been big on nonverbals. - The data from crossection B... (emotional music) - Yo, whassup Pat? - Oh, hey Bryce. - What's up, man? What you up to? - Just sitting. (emotional music) - Dude, it's what you see all the time. - What is it I see? I sure don't know. - It's just black. - Okay, imagine that you're looking at something with your elbow. - Yeah, that ain't happening. - Exactly, I can't see black, white, light, dark, red, blue, green, any of that. - Sorry, bro. - It's fine. It's not about what you see, but how you see it. Are you all right? - You ever thought about joining the marching band? - What? When? - Right. They're having marching band auditions. - Well I can't march. - But you're good at music stuff, though. - Yeah. - I'd take you. - Well, maybe. - They're this afternoon. What you got to lose? - So, what instrument do you play? - Trumpet. - Are you any good? - Well my dad taught me to play from memory. (plays alternating notes) - Now you try. - Okay. - Okay. (plays intricate notes) (drumming) (marching band plays) (marching music plays through headphones) - Hey Kevin. Good to see you. - Thanks for coming in. I just have a couple papers for you to sign. - No problem. So, where's Patrick? - He's on his way. Listen, I know that graduation's coming up fast, but I want to make sure I told you. You truly have an amazing son. - Well thank you. I know that when I was his age all I did was goof off. - Woo, yeah! - Watch out! - Come on, is that all you got? - Patrick? - Didn't see that one coming. Dad? I'm fine, Dad. - I'm sorry. - Dad, please, we were just having fun. - You two should know better. - The nurse's station's right down here. Let's just get him checked out to be sure. - I'm sorry! - [Patrick] Dad, I'm fine. (bell rings) - Last class. - I know, it's crazy. I don't know what I'm gonna do with myself. - You'll be fine. - Thanks, Mr. Howard. - Please, call me Kevin. It's our last class! - It's sad. - Patrick, don't you dare let this ending get you down. You've got bigger things to do. - Can I drive it? - No, but you two can start it. - I'm too young to die. - Hey, not a bad driver, okay? - Yeah. - Mr. Hughes. - Oh, hey Bryce. - What's up, man? - Well congratulations, Bryce. - Thank you. I'm gonna miss you, bro. - Yeah, 'cause Lexington's so far away. - Hey, Patrick tell ya? He's gonna be a real live member of the U of L pep band. - Really? - It's true. - No, I'm sorry. We have a policy. In order to be in the pep band you have to first be in the marching band. - And I'm aware of that, but you can't make an exception? I mean, come on! - No, no, I'm sorry. He'd have to march. Patrick, I saw you at the Crusade years ago. You played the Crusade Cannonball? You were fantastic. - Well thank you very much. - And that's very sweet, but my son is going to have all the same opportunities as every other kid in this school. You can't exclude him. - I didn't say anything about excluding him. I said he has to be a member of the marching band in order to be considered for the pep band. - Patrick was already on the Atherton marching band. And I don't want to see him sitting on the sidelines again. - Well neither do I. I want to see him march with everybody else. (sighs) Look, we can find somebody to push him through the formations and Patrick, well everybody knows Patrick can play. - I'm sorry, but no. Absolutely not. I cannot take the risk that somebody might dump him on the field in front of 40,000 people. I'm sorry! - Well, then my hands are tied. He can't march, he can't play. - Look Patrick... - I hate being different! - You're not different. - Okay, what else can I do, bowling? - You just need to focus on the things that you can do. - I know, I am trying! Why can't we find someone else to push me? - We've been over this. - I want to march! - You can't... You can't march. - You said I wasn't different. - How'd it go? - I don't want to talk about it. (marching music plays through headphones) - Do you have those sales reports I asked for? - Yeah, I emailed it. Do you want me to resend it? - No, I'll check. How's my presentation for the board coming along? - I'm working on it now. - I need it right away. - Yes sir. (phone rings) - Hello? Oh yes, just a second. It's for you, Patrick. - Hello, this is Patrick. - Patrick, it's Dr. Byrne. How are you? - Oh, hi. - Just wanted you to know we found someone to push you for the band. That is, if you still want to. - Of course, that's what I've always wanted. But my dad, is he okay with this? - He knows. You just make sure you're at the practice field tomorrow. 5:30. - Wow, okay, thank you so much. - No problem, Patrick. See you tomorrow. - Sounds good. I'm gonna march! - All right, well you have fun. - Bye Mom, I will. - He'll be fine. I'm very glad to have you here, Patrick. - Me too, I sure didn't get any sleep last night. So who's gonna be pushing me? - Well, he's not here yet, but he will be soon. - 5:29, I'm not late. - Dad, what are you doing here? - Well, I thought maybe I'd push ya. - Okay band, let's rock and roll. Let's get at it. All right, ready? One, two, one, two ready and. (band plays) Okay stop, stop. Matt, listen, if you're gonna head up this line then you gotta lead him in the right direction. Arc back to the 20 yard line. (drumming) - Morning Charles. Did you get the presentation? - I did. - And? - And, we'll talk about it. - Okay. (drumming) (saw buzzes) - One, two, one, two ready and. - Jesse, slow down bud. - How are you? Oh, that bad, huh? Oh oh oh, shoes, shoes. How was your day? - I'm hungry. - Okay, well we'll eat soon. - I'm hungry now. - He's a machine. This is killing me. - Is it worth it? - It is, but there's just so much work. I cannot do both. (phones ringing) - Patrick. - Sir. - How are you? - Well, sir. - Have a seat. You've been with this agency for a long time. - 19 years. - That's a long time to be with anybody. - There's no question you've been an outstanding employee. But these past few weeks, we've had some tough decisions to make. - I'm sorry, what are you saying exactly? - We want to give you a promotion Patrick. I've been here an even longer time and quite frankly, I'm ready to retire. I want you to replace me. - Sir. I don't know what to say. - Uh, yes? (laughing) - We need you around here. You've really stepped it up and we want you to know that that hasn't gone unnoticed. It's a win-win. Better benefits, better salary. - There will be quite a bit more travel. You know, New York, Vegas, Phoenix. - Plenty of time to get away from the fam. Enjoy life a little. - They'll have a better life, too. - How often would I need to be traveling? - Keep your schedule open. - Right. Right, well, thank you. Thank you guys so much. I cannot begin to tell you how much I appreciate the opportunity. I'm very excited. - Good job. - Sir, thank you. Patricia, honey? - [TV Announcer] Have become an unlikely father and son marching band team. - You guys, Daddy's got some big news. - Come here, come here, come here. Sit, watch. - We interviewed Dr. Greg Byrne, director of the U of L marching band. - The Hughes are a great addition as a two member team to our marching band and it really shows the potential everyone has regardless of their circumstances. - [TV Announcer] The sacrifice and love shown in this father son relationship is something we all can learn from. - 20 years, Mike. Almost 20 years. Coffee runs and reports and late nights and weekends and bad breaks and then I finally catch a break. - You should be happy. (knocking) - Hey. What are you listening to? - Just music, what's up? - Look. We need to talk. The last couple of weeks, getting to see you in the band, everything, it has-- - Save your breath, Dad. I know we're quitting. - You do? - I can hear everything, remember? - Right. Listen. I'm sorry, Patrick. Goodnight, buddy. Why do you want to be a part of the band so bad? - Isn't that what we all want? - What? - To play a part of a bigger picture, to matter. - Patrick, of course you matter. - I'm talking about the band, Dad. This is something I'm good at and I know you're just trying to provide for us, I understand that. But we're part of this, and who knows where it's gonna end up, but don't you wanna see? (emotional music) (sighs) (knocking) - Come in! - Good morning, sir. - Hey, Patrick. Good to see you. Hey, sit down. - Uh, thank you, sir, this will only take a minute. - Hey, saw you on TV last night. That was a hoot. - Yes sir, I suppose it was. Actually, that's partly what I wanted to speak with you about. - How so? - Well, first of all I can't begin to express how grateful I am to you, the board, everyone. I spent the night praying about it, sir, and I just can't accept the promotion, Charles. - Hold on. Do you realize what you're saying? - Yes sir, I do, and that's exactly why I'm leaving. - You have a son who can't see anything, has all sorts of medical problems, a family that you're supposed to be leading and you're gonna quit? Get your priorities straight, Patrick! - My priorities, sir, are just fine. (emotional music swells) - What made you do it? - I'm tired of sitting on the sidelines. - I love you. - I love you, too. - Ready and one, two, one two ready and. Okay stop, reset. Come on. (emotional music) - Patrick? - I'm sorry Dad, I didn't mean to wake you. - Hey, you made it. - Yeah, I did. - Let me guess, you're thirsty? - Parched. - Listen, wake me up next time, okay? - I just know you need your sleep. - I already told you. Four hours and I'm good. Here, it's in front of you. Now, let's go get you ready. - Okay. - So you nervous? - Maybe a little, you? - Eh. Yeah. - Don't be, you'll do great. It's just like we practiced. - Ah, that's what I'm worried about. Gosh, you should see it, Patrick. 42,000 seats and tomorrow they'll all be watching. - It's pretty exciting. - Yeah it is. You know, I remember the very first game in this stadium. It was against Kentucky then, too. The second quarter, Redmond, he gets down on the center. He takes the snap, he drops back, fakes the handoff, fires to Otis, 22 yards, touchdown! And everybody went nuts! It was incredible. You don't remember that game, do you? - Not really. Honestly, they all kind of blend together. Did we win? - Uh, no, we lost. 68-34, but we did win every other game in this stadium that season. - Hey Dad? - Yeah. - Thank you. You've given up everything for me. Everything. And you're my hero. - Patrick, what you go through every single day, you're mine. I love you. - I love you, Dad. (chatter) How do I look? - You do look good in red. - Because I totally know what that means. - You look great, buddy. - Big day! - You guys ready? - Yup. - I got faith in ya. Just like we practiced. - Right. - You look good in red. (exciting music) - You ready to take this field with me, Dad? - Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it. - Ready? - You ready? - Ready. - Keep your head up, high as it'll go! Woo! (cheering) (triumphant music) - We love you!
