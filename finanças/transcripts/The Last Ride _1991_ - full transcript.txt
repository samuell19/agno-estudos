[ominous music] [downbeat music] [man shouting] What time is it? Hey, what time is it? Do I look like Big Ben to you? MICHAEL: Come on, I have to go before the board today. It's 8:30. Aw, Jesus. That gives me half an hour to get ready. Think I'll make it? I think you better make it. [downbeat music] Well, Mr. Smith, your record here seems to be quite impressive. Well, sir, considering I didn't do anything to begin with, I think I've been here long enough. Mr. Smith, you say you are innocent, but you were convicted of the crime and there were eyewitnesses. Well, ma'am, they lied. Why would they lie? Well, if I knew that, I don't think I'd be here, would I? Mr. Smith if you were paroled, you have made arrangements for accommodations and employment? Yeah. I have a sister, and she has a business. And you'll be working for her? Are there any more questions? Thank you, Mr. Smith. Shit. What do they know? Well, I'm beginning to think I'm never going to get out of here. Oh come on, don't think that way. Christ, you got to get out this time. Else I won't ever have my own cell. Ain't this a goddamned disgrace? I've been here for 25 years and I can't even piss in peace. Hey, hey. hey, Mikey, how'd you like to have some of that? Please. Looks good, huh? MICHAEL: I'd rather have scotch and water. One lump of ice or two? How about we have a little drink to celebrate? Where did you get this? Well, after 25 years I may not be able to piss in peace, but I still have a few tricks up my sleeve. God, this shit is gasoline. ADAMS: No, it's not gas. But it'll probably start your car just the same. Go ahead and drink up. There's plenty where that came from. This is your going away party. Yeah, well what makes you think I'm going anywhere? Just call it a hunch. RADIO ANNOUNCER: Back to more great music in just a moment. But first, this just in from our news desk. The bodies of two slain women were discovered by state police early this morning on Route 18, between Andersonville and Timber Ridge. Police are withholding the names of the victims pending notification of family members, but did report that they had each been stabbed several times. In other news, the Senate Armed Services Committee meets in Washington today to discuss-- GUARD: Let's go Smith. What? Pack it up, you're out of here. Where we going? You got paroled. Come on, what do you want me to do, take you out to dinner? Yes! Look here, don't be looking at me. I ain't taking your ass to dinner. You only got a few minutes to get your stuff together. If it was me, I'd be gone already. OK. What am I gonna do first? Take a deep breath. You're not just reading fresh air anymore. You're breathing freedom. Oh, good, the freedom of speech. You know Adams, sometimes I wonder if there is such thing as freedom. That's 'cause you ain't never been without it. MICHAEL: Yeah? What do you call eight years in this place? Oh hell, they put you away for a few years, but you've never been without your freedom. I lost eight years of my life. I'd give every year of my life for just one day of freedom. One day without fear of anything. One day of no one, no matter what I do or where I go, people just leave me be. I'll never know that feeling. Hell, I can't even dream about it anymore. Adams, if there's anything I can do for you on the outside-- I already told you. Take a deep breath. GUARD: Let's go Smith, you're out of here. Well, Adams, I'm gonna-- well, I'm gonna miss you. You should, because I'm a great guy. GUARD: OK love birds, spare me will you? Come on Smith, let's go. Don't forget to write. MICHAEL: I'll write. I'll read. [downbeat music] That belong to your girlfriend? Or are you a faggot? There was money in this wallet. Well, there ain't none now. [downbeat music] Let's go. See you real soon. [gate buzzing] [thunder crashing] [gentle music] Yes! Hey. Hi. I take it you've got somewhere to be and it ain't here. Yeah, could you give me a ride? Get in, I didn't stop for a chat. Oh great man, I appreciate it. Thanks. My name's Mike. Mike? I had a friend named Mike once. Man, was he nuts. You ain't crazy are you? I don't know. I must be to be out here, right? No, no, I'm only joking. Don't worry, I know what you mean. I must be crazy too. Philip. No, Mike. What? I said, my name is Mike. And my name is Philip. You did want to know my name, didn't you? Oh, oh. Yeah, absolutely. It's nice to meet you, Philip. Hey, I'd offer you a cigarette, but I left them back there on the road. Oh yeah? How's that? Well, I had a blow out. Just couldn't get them. Scared the shit out of me. You ever have the shit scared out of you, Mike? No, not lately. Hey, you got a problem? Must be losing air in that tire. Come on, take it easy. You don't want to kill us here. Hang on! Shit! [tires squealing] Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing? Are you trying to kill the both of us? Don't ever touch this fucking wheel again! I had control. Bullshit. Son of a bitch. Listen, you stay with this truck. Don't fucking move. No, I'm coming with you. I said stay here. MICHAEL: Where are you going? I'm going to go check out that car. [ominous music] Shit. Sir, are you all right? Hell, hello. Sir? Oh, you took quite a spill there. [ominous music] Geez, I guess that tire wasn't low on air after all. Look, I think I've had enough of this ride. Thank you. Going somewhere? Huh, Mike? I scared the shit out of you, didn't I? I knew it as soon as you said your name was Mike. Mike's never played fair. Never, never. A games a game, Mike. And that's what you have to understand. Just keep away from me! PHILIP: A games a game, Mike! [ominous music] [shouting in pain] Oh, shit! I can't let you leave, Mike. Scared the shit out of you, didn't I Mike? [dramatic music] How fast can you run, Mike? What the fuck is wrong with you? You know Mike, that's a very good question. You know, that's about the best question you can ask in your situation right now. [laughing] Well, Mike, I'd like to stick around and talk while, but I've got trucker stuff to do. See ya later. [laughing] [ominous music] [sirens blaring] [ominous music] You in a hurry this evening? Officer, I got a guy in the back and he's bleeding and he needs help. OFFICER: What the-- Jesus Christ. Step out of the car! MICHAEL: Wait a minute, you don't understand. Step out of the car! MICHAEL: Jesus. OFFICER: Hands, get your hands where I can see them. Officer, I did not do this. Down on the ground, face first. Oh, God. OFFICER: All right pal, freeze. Now, freeze! Don't move. Not a move. Dispatch, dispatch, 252, over. DISPATCH: Dispatch, go on 252. Dispatch I've got a stabbing victim here. Requesting backup and an ambulance immediately. I'm approximately 15 miles northbound on I-95, over. DISPATCH: 10-4. On its way. Dispatch, 252 out. All right, get up. Get up, put your hands on your head. MICHAEL: OK. Turn around, face the car. You had you some fun tonight, didn't you? What'd you kill the old man for scumbag? 10, $20? I did not do this! OFFICER: What's this for? Whittling? I pulled it out of my own hand. Shut up! Oh my god, that's him! What? That's him, that's the guy who did it. Shut the fuck up! Please, you've got to believe me, that guy's nuts! I don't know what kind of shit you're trying to feed me, but you better shut up. We have got to get out of the road! Well, if that is the killer, we can't let him get away now can we? Get down on the ground! Get down on the ground! Step out of the truck! I said, step out of the-- shit. [gun firing] I'll blow your fucking head off! Now get out of the truck! [ominous music] Shit! [gun firing] [officer shouting] You can't blame him for this! If Michael would've just played fair, none of this would have ever happened! You can have him! Let me go! What about the rules? What rules? Yeah, sure. You're just like the rest of them. You want to make up all the rules, but when it comes down to a following them, you just pretend. OFFICER: Oh, God. Well, pretend. Me and Mr. Michael, we don't need your kind around here anyway. OFFICER: Come on, let me go! Do we, Michael? Hey cop, you ever had the shit scared outta you? No, no! [officer shouting] [ominous music] [car exploding] Michael! Be careful! [ominous music] Holy shit, what the hell happened here? OFFICER: Hey Sheriff, come here. Take a look. [downbeat music] We got some tire tracks heading out of here too. Sheriff! Got fresh footprints leading right to these woods here. All right. For starters, let's get this area roped off. We can't do anything with the footprints till we get some daylight. Then we move. [downbeat music] So, are you boys done? Yeah, hon. It's awful what happened last night. Can we get the check please, Deb? We got to run. Don't worry about it. So, is it true this guy just got out of prison? OFFICER: Where'd you hear that? On the radio. Boy, good news travels fast around here, huh? MAN: Excuse me, can I get some coffee please? Yeah, be right there. So you guys think you're gonna really catch this nut? You can count on it. Well, you don't sound so sure. Don't worry, we'll get him. DEB: I hope so. Why don't you tell me what this guy looks like and I'll keep an eye out for him. Listen, this is a police matter. Leave it to us, OK? So Deb, what do we owe you? I said it's on me. Thanks, Deb. You're a sweetheart. I love you. If you see anybody suspicious, lock the door. And call us, OK? OK. Bye. Bye. So I'll see about 6:00? Hard to say. Might be late. PHILIP: I love this thing. DEB: Ready for a fill up? No, thank you. I'm fine for now. This is going to be a long day. And it's getting longer by the second. [ominous music] Oh my God. [downbeat music] That's fine. Can I help you? Yes, is your Sheriff in? Just missed him. Oh, that's too bad. Could you give him this for me? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Could I have a name or something? Dr. Rouchet. Jim Rouchet. Doctor, huh? RADIO ANNOUNCER: So far, the police report his whereabouts as unknown. Michael Smith, a 36-year-old man just paroled from state prison, has gone on a killing spree. Police say two men, possibly more are involved. Investigation-- This stuff gives me the creeps. Me too. I mean, here I am just passing through town and I could be sitting next to some maniac right now. Well, I wouldn't worry about it too much. I know most of the people around here. And besides, you know, I think I could tell. How? I don't know. I think crazy people just have a certain look about them, you know? I guess you never really know people. I guess. Can I get you some more coffee? No. I gotta get going. I got a big day today. Are you a trucker? Yeah, seems that way. Where are you going? Crazy. What's wrong? Don't I look crazy? No. You look sweet. Well, I am. But I'm also crazy. [ominous music] MICHAEL: Jesus Christ, look at this thing. [ominous music] [metal clanking] You know, I can't believe you missed that pheasant. It flew right in front of your damn gun. MAN: Yeah, well I didn't see you kill anything. Did you kill anything? Get the hell out of here and leave me alone. I'm gonna go back and get some more shells. Now you just wait. I'll show you you son of a bitch. [inaudible] Shit. OK, listen up. We're going to cover an eight square mile radius out here today. Team B is coming in from the northwest side of the mountain, so if this guy is out there, we're going to find him. He's armed and dangerous. I don't need to remind you that Watkins died last night of his injuries. He was a good officer and a good friend. But we're not out here to get even. We're out here to apprehend the son of a bitch who did this. So let's stay awake out there, OK? All right, let's go. 263, this is 111, over. OFFICER: 263 here. This is 111, we're moving out. OFFICER: 10-4. We're out of here. Good luck. [ominous music] Shit. [ominous music] It's OK. It's OK. What the hell? [dramatic music] Hey! Shit! [man grunting] [dramatic music] Bud, shoot him Bud! Shoot him, Bud! [gun firing] [dramatic music] [horn honking] Hello. What are you doing? You want to go for a ride? I thought you had a big day today? It can wait. Well, I can't just leave the diner. Sure you can. We'll only be a few minutes. Besides, I washed the truck and everything. Come on. - No, I really can't. - OK. Maybe next time. Yeah, maybe next time. [ominous music] What does she know anyway? Nothing. Not a god damned thing. Nobody really knows anything anyway. You're really something. You set me up for your fall. Well, I'm only what you made me. I didn't have a choice. But you? You can choose. You can go for a ride, or you can stay. Ride, or stay. Stay, or ride. [ominous music] Looks like it. BART: That's it, all right. Let's check it out. [ominous music] Hey Bart, get over here. We got something. [ominous music] I'll call it in. 111, 111, come in. Yeah, I'm right here. What do you got? We've got the suspect's truck at the old gas station north of Johnstown. All right. We're not far from your position. You hold tight, I'm on my way, over. BART: 10-4. Listen up, continue the sweep and stay on your radios. I'll be in contact. [ominous music] [train horn blaring] Joe. [train horn blaring] Joe, is that you? [ominous music] Don't even breathe. Get up. Freeze. I guess better late than never. John and me, we're going down the hill, right? And he says, well, I can make it through the pothole no problem. And I say, no way. We're not going to make it through the pothole. That thing is huge. So we get halfway, and what happens? Guess. Yeah, we get stuck. Exactly. So we have to crawl out of the rig, we crawl through the water. He says, I got an electric winch. We can hook it right up. So we hook up the winch, tie it up around a tree, we turn it on, bang. Doesn't work. - Hi. - Hi. DEB: What can I get for you? Oh, coffee please. DEB: Anything else? Maybe so. I was wondering if you've seen this man before? Well yeah, he was just here. Did you talk to him? Uh huh, he's real nice. Is he a friend of yours? Yes. We've known each other for many years. Did he say where he was going? I'd like to talk to him. No. But I think he might be back. What makes you so sure? I think he likes me. What about your coffee? - Keep it warm. I'll be back. [ominous music] JOE: So you like killing cops, convict? Huh? Do ya? You and your buddy aren't leaving here alive, ass wipe. I told you I don't know the guy. BART: Come on, Joe. He's innocent until proven guilty, remember? Looks like your lucky day, prick. 263, this is 111, over. 263, where are you god damn it? Yeah Sheriff, we're here. What's up? I'm about 20 minutes out. You guys find anything? Come on, talk to me. BART: Yeah Sheriff, we got one of them. You've got one of them? Why the hell didn't you call it in? BART: We just got him. I was about to call you. All right. All right, OK. Listen up. You take the suspect, you put him in the car, you get every piece of evidence that exists and you put that in the car, then you drive to the station. Are we clear on this? BART: Yes, sir. 111 out. Jesus Christ. Back so soon? I just took a look around for my friend. Lovely area. It's all right. Would another coffee would be too much to ask? Will you drink it this time? I'll do my best. Where are the restrooms? They're in the back. Thank you. [ominous music] Well, hi. What'd you do, take the day off? Nah, I just couldn't leave someone as beautiful as you. You can do better than that. OK. Let's get married and have babies. Well, guess what? What? Your friend is here. - The old man? - Yeah. He's in the bathroom. He'll be right out. We're gonna go play a trick on him. Come on. [ominous music] Hello? Hello? Is there anybody out there? Hey Doc, what's up? JIM: Philip? Is that you Philip? Yeah Doc, it's me. Run, young lady, run! He's a killer! He's an escaped mental patient! Can you imagine that? Me, a killer? An escaped mental patient. Don't you want my autograph? Or would you rather make my [inaudible] Philip, remember the rules! The game! You've been making the rules long enough, Doc! It's my turn now! Come on! - Philip! DEB: No! Philip! Philip! Philip! PHILIP: Come on, come on. DEB: No! Where are you taking me? For a ride. You want to go for a ride, don't ya? DEB: No! PHILIP: Yeah, you're going for a ride. Come on, get in there. Shut up. Get in there. [ominous music] Philip. [ominous music] Which way do we go? Right or left? Right it is. Here we go. [ominous music] So what about those kids, Deb? Please. I've been thinking. Please, don't hurt me. Hurt ya? It only hurts for a second. What? Don't worry, it only hurts for a second. What are you talking about? You know Deb, I'm giving you the answers, and you're filling in the questions, and this is getting very boring. If you would have just read the rule book, you wouldn't ask these stupid questions. Please. Take me back. Back, back, there is no back. There's only forward. Can't you see that? Don't you understand? This is America. That's what makes America great, going forward. Don't you agree? [ominous music] All right. [ominous music] You Michael, you made me do this. Debbie, where the hell are you? You got me all wrong. I'm only trying to help you. [ominous music] Debbie, you're starting to piss me off! [pulse pounding] Where the hell is she? [branches snapping] [dramatic music] [glass cracking] [debbie screaming] Now I'm going to tear your fucking throat out! [tires squealing] [ominous music] DEB: No! No! [philip shouting] [ominous music] Listen, I keep telling you guys I am not the man you're looking for. Well, I tell you, you work with me on this, and I'll work with you. You just don't want to listen, do you? I mean, that guy is still out there and he's gonna kill somebody. How do you know him? He tried to kill me. When? Last night. Look, what difference does this make? TURNER: Excuse me, Sheriff. This came in for you from a Dr. Rouchet. He says it's very important. What the hell is this? Turner, would you excuse me for a minute here? TURNER: Yes, sir. SHERIFF: You know this guy? Yes. This is him. This is the killer. [suspenseful music] [debbie crying] [ominous music] JIM: Debbie. [debbie screaming] Oh! Hey, what's the matter? Calm down, talk to me. He tried to kill me. Who? What? What? The guy you're looking for, he's crazy. Where is he? Where is he now? On Old Brooks Road. Oh Jim, I think I killed him. Hey, have you called? Have you called? No. OK. OK, look, I'm going to use the phone, OK? OK? OK? OK. OK. [ominous music] Shit. Wait right here. Where are you going? I'm going to the car to use the radio. Everything's all right. Keep yourself busy. Look, make some coffee. There's going to be a lot of people here real soon. Dispatch, this Jim at Highway 27 at the cafe, looks like that Deb's had a little run in with the guy out here. Maybe he's dead. He's on Old Brooks Road. I'm going to need some backup. So get here right-- [jim choking] [philip grunting] [ominous music] Jim? [ominous music] [debbie crying out] Your friends got a nice toy, but I like yours better. You have any idea how much one of these babies hurts? [philip laughing] I thought I had you too. All of a sudden, wham! Sit right there. Where's Jim? Coffee, just what I need, a little pick me up. Hey, look at us. I'm serving you. I feel good about that too. Cream or sugar? Cream or sugar? - Cream. - Cream. OK, cream. [ominous music] Where is it? [philip shouting] [ominous music] DEB: Start, come on. You're gonna need these to start that thing. You didn't tell me the coffee was gonna be on me. You know what your problem is? You need a little excitement in your life. Have you seen Michael? Where could he be? Come here. Stop crying. Just come here. I said, come here! Did I ever tell you me and Michael go way back? Father told me, you want something done right, do it yourself. Not that much my father, but that just popped into my head. Hey, it's your friend's car. We're going to go for a ride. Stay right there, don't go anywhere. OK pal, sorry. No chaperones on this ride. Come on honey, in you go. Get in there. All right. Holy shit, will you look at all this stuff? [siren wailing] Yeah! Is your sheriff in? It's a matter of life and death. TURNER: All right, come on. Sheriff, here's the doctor I was telling you about. He's here in your town and he's going to kill again. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold it. Now, you explain to me just what the fuck is going on here. Look, we don't have much time. He's going to kill a girl if he hasn't killed her already. What girl? What the hell are you talking about? The girl at the diner. Oh my god, Deb. Turner, get in here! Call the diner. Make sure that everybody over there is OK, then give me the prisoner. Yes, sir. Now, you've got 15 seconds to explain this. His name is Philip, Philip Holtman. He's an escaped mental patient. He's been loose for about a month. I'm his doctor. I've been-- Now hold on. Why didn't you stop him? Because aside from being mentally ill, he's amazingly clever. What are you trying to say? I'm just giving you the facts. Sheriff, the lines are down at the diner. God damn it. You still want me to go get the other guy? SHERIFF: No. - What other guy? We arrested another guy. We think he teamed up with your friend. That's impossible. He has no friends. His only family is me. You know, I'd like to hear about this family connection. JIM: I must see this other man. Go get the suspect. Yes, sir. SHERIFF: And send Bart in here, will ya? Yes, sir. There's something else you must realize. The only way we're going to take him alive is my way. Alive? Alive? I'm going to nail his ass to the wall. Yeah, Sheriff, what's up? Did you see Deb today? Yeah, I saw her this morning. Check on her, make sure she's OK. Yeah, OK. I'll go right away. Hey, I've seen this guy before. JIM: What? I saw him at the diner this morning. He was talking about the killing last night. Son of a bitch! Hey Sheriff, not going to believe this. There's some guy on the horn named Philip. Says he wants to talk to Michael. You want to pick up on that? Hello, hello, hello. Don't worry, we'll get Michael, then go on. 10-4 Roger, come in. - Yeah, I'm right here. This is Sheriff Bolt. Now, why don't you tell me exactly where you-- Whoa, whoa, big guy. Hold on, I'm asking for Michael. Who is Michael? I don't know what you're talking about. Well, Well, let me refresh your memory. [debbie screaming] Now, you don't want me to get nasty, do ya? You better let me talk to him. He's not stupid. He knows we're all here. I don't want Debbie hurt, so you do this carefully. Hello, Philip. Hey Doc, what's up? Sorry, I couldn't resist. Now listen up, I know you're all huddled around that radio like stink in a shit pot, so I'll make it quick. I get Mike, you get the girl. You sound upset Philip. What's the matter? Don't they understand your game? Michael knows, don't you Mike? Yeah buddy, I understand. Michael, you're really there. Man, I thought you were long gone. No, no, of course not Philip. You should know me better than that. Should I? Find out where he is, find out if Debbie's all right. Yeah, Philip, so where are you, huh? What do you want? Hell Mike, I don't know where I'm at. You see now, these woods all look the same to me. I don't know. You guys know where I'm at. You want to know something else? I'm hungry. Ask him about the game the game, the game. Debbie, is she all right? Hey, who's this? Let me guess, can't be the guy that owned this car. He's dead. Oh, it must be Debbie's old boyfriend. Sorry pal, she's left you for a better man. Philip, what do you say we just play the game? We are, you just don't know it. Then why don't we let the girl go? We don't need her, do we? Hey Mike, it's always good to have a lady around. Besides, she's the bait. Sarg, help me, please! Shut up! All right, Philip, now you know it's not right to hit a woman, right? I'm getting better though. If this would have been the last time, I would have killed her. Ain't that right, Doc? What's he talking about? What's he talking about? The hell with this, I'm going to get him. Bart. Bart! We'll talk about this later. Listen, that's fun, but right now, you're going to have to figure out what it is you're going to do. Hey, what's going on? You guys leave or what? Hey, I want to talk to the Doc. Yes, Philip? Doc, you remember that game we used to play when-- Uh, we shouldn't talk about that right now, Philip. Let's talk about you coming in and getting something to eat. What do you say? No thanks, I'll wait for Michael. All right, Philip let's cut the bullshit. Where and when? You know, that's what I like about lawmen. Straight to the point. I'll tell you what, you be by that radio at eight o'clock, and we'll do it then. Do what then? I haven't decided yet. But I promise you, it'll be fun. Look, I'm out of here. See you guys later. Say goodbye, hon. I guess cat's got her tongue. So, what do we do now? We don't do anything. I think Mike would be a valuable asset to our situation. Let me straighten you out on something. First of all, we are not working together. As far as I'm concerned, you and you are accomplices to this Philip character. Which brings me to you. Now, I want to know exactly what we're into here. Well, if I don't tell you, you'll never really know the danger. Come on, talk to me. Philip is my, is my patient. He's mentally ill. We've grown close in the past 10 years. 10 years? This isn't the first time he's got out. In fact, this time they let him out. Are you trying to tell me you set this psycho loose in my town? He's not a psycho. He's mentally ill. They thought he would act normal this time. He passed all the tests and examinations, so they set him free. I tried to warn them, but they wouldn't listen. So I followed him. And I knew he was playing his game. Doc, what is this game? The game is something we use at the hospital to keep the patients we're studying under control. We teach them that everything we do is a game, and each game has rules. Of course, we make up the rules as we go along. The point is, the patients listen to them and follow them. So what happened with this guy? I'm not sure. He started making up his own rules, his own games. Jesus Christ. What does that mean? It means, whether we like it or not, we're in his game. And he plays to win. We taught him well, God help us. [ominous music] Deb? Deb? Debbie! I'm sorry. What? What I mean is, I'm sorry for what I've done to you. I never meant to hurt you. It's just that sometimes I can't help it. It's not too late you know. I mean, you could still turn yourself in. All I ever wanted was for him to stay. I begged him to stay. Who? He knew she was going to hurt me. She always did. He didn't care, so here I am. DEB: I don't understand. You're not meant to. No one is. Did I ever tell you my parents died when I was little? And that the state figured that my grandparents would take care of me? My grandfather was OK, but my grandmother, she was a real game player. One of the best. She came up with the dead game. That's how we got rid of grandpa. She said, everything according to the rules. You must play by the rules, Phillip. You must play by the rules. It was a long time before the smell got so bad that the neighbors had to call the health department. I tried to tell them, I'm only going by the rules. That they weren't playing fair. Rules are so important. You know what I mean? DEB: Where did these rules come from? My head. Where else? It's grandma. I'll just be sitting around, and a rule will pop into my head. But it's a good thing. I don't know what I'd do without them. They keep me going. I don't have a choice. Rules are rules. Rules are rules. But didn't anyone ever tell you that rules were meant to be broken? A year ago, I'd have killed you for saying that. I'm sorry, I didn't mean-- I've had enough of this bullshit! Time to play the game. Come on, where are you guys? Let's go. Hey man, I'm getting tired of this. Hey, Doc? Yeah, I'm here. PHILIP: Come on you guys! Doc, what is he doing? He's not supposed call till eight o'clock. Somebody! Come on, somebody! Hey guys, what's going on here? That Phillip character is on the radio again. Where's the Sheriff? I don't know. He left and I can't find him on the radio. All right, look, you're going to have to talk to Philip. No, no, you've got to talk to him Michael. He'll listen to you. You're the one he wants. Hey, wait fellas, I've got my orders. You're supposed to stay put until the Sheriff gets back. She'll be dead by then if she's not dead already. Look, he's gonna kill her! PHILIP: You guys are gonna wish you'd played my game. That's it! Philip. Philip. Come on, Philip, I want to play. What's he gonna do, Doc? Whatever he wants to. I'll put it out on the CB. JIM: No, no, that's not a good idea. Why? JIM: It'll just give him more people to kill, Jesus, this is great. Look, obviously it's up to us. We're going to have to find him. Now wait a minute, you guys are under arrest. Oh right, and what are you going to tell the Sheriff? That you sat here and did nothing? He's right, we have no choice. Well, I'm going to go with you then. No, no, you have to stay here with the CB. Now, we'll put our radio on channel 3, and if Philip calls, you patch him through, OK? He's not going to be about to know we're not at the station. That's very impressive. This is going to mean my job. [ominous music] Well, it's time to get some gas. And it's self-serve too. We need to trace the steps from where you first met. He likes familiar ground. All right, I see. It's sort of like returning to the scene of the crime? Uh, something like that. OK, just a second. Hello? Hello? Yeah, is anybody there? Come in please. I read you loud and clear. Yeah, we're going to head on back to where-- We're just looking around. We'll call back. Hello? Hello? Doc, What the hell are you saying? It's us and him. The less the better. Listen, Doc, now I don't have any idea what your trip is with this guy, and I really don't give a shit, but whatever it is, your boy is going down. JIM: All in good time. [ominous music] Let's go! Oh, real cute. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Boy, it is getting cold out here. Don't you think it's cold? Yes, it's cold. Well, we're going to heat things up. Grab onto that. Grab it. Don't move. Don't. Debbie, you're getting so good. Hey, hold on. Just relax. Stay there. MICHAEL: Come on Philip, talk to me. I know you're there. Come on! Philip! PHILIP: Now wait here. Be right back. MICHAEL: OK Doc, Right here's where he stabbed me. Do you remember anything unusual about him? Anything at all? I thought stabbing me was a little unusual. Look, you don't understand-- PHILIP: Hey, Mike! So you're still around? Yeah, yeah, Philip. Of course, I'm right here. I'm in jail, remember? I remember, but you're too late. You're all too late. I just changed the rules again. Oh come on man, that's not fair, is it? Fair? You're worried about me being unfair? Great. Is my doctor around? Yes, yes, I'm here. Hey Doc, listen, am I playing unfair? No. Not yet. Doc, what are you saying? PHILIP: You see Mike, I told you. I just don't play unfair. Besides, it's my game. Ain't that right, Doc? Yes, yes, that's right Philip. Philip, where are you? You know, I've been asking myself that my whole fucking life. Philip, is the girl still alive/ The girl. You know, that depends on what your definition of living is. I've been alive for 36 years, but dangit, it doesn't feel like I'm alive. Then she is alive? Yeah, yeah. The girl is still alive. What's going on? Sheriff, I've got them on the radio again. What do you mean them? I had to let the prisoners go. Philip was going to kill Deb. No! OK, listen up. I want both of you back here now. Do you understand me? Did you hear me, Doc? I'll charge you both with obstructing justice. Sheriff, no. Deputy, your ass is mine when this is over. PHILIP: Great, Doc. You had me going for someone who prides himself on fair play. You should all practice what you preach! Shit! Shit! Shit! PHILIP: It's over. No Philip, it's not over yet. We've still got time to-- he's gone. Would you mind telling me what's going on? Yes, time for that fill up. Don't you agree? DEB: Oh no! Shit! These fucking things never work like they're supposed to work! Like in the movies, you know? Everything's so easy and planned. I hate movies. Hey, I hate movies. But you know what, I bet you that cop car has some gas. So this might be your lucky day after all. Let's see what we have here. Oh, yes. The real thing. Well, I say we hop the next train out of here. Because you know the Sheriff catches up with us, he's gonna lock our asses up. Oh, Jesus Christ, that's it! PHILIP: Here I come. [philip laughing] Yes. No. No, no! PHILIP: Yes. [debbie shouting] Yeah. How's that feel, huh? Yeah! Oh, yeah! [philip laughing] JIM: Where are we going? Look, the first train was before, right? So you were right, he's going back to square one. Yeah. Sheriff? Yes, Sheriff? Doc, what the fuck are you doing? I told you, it's us and him. Jesus, you have no intentions of killing him, do you? Only if it's necessary. Jesus Christ. All right, nobody touches the radio. Come on baby, light my fire. I have no sense of humor. I'm pissed off. This is all Michael's fault. That stupid mother fucker. How much farther? I don't know. I don't know. It's going this way I think. It's just a little while longer. All right, here we go. All right, it's right up this road. Oh, shit. We don't have much time! God damn. All right, here we go. It's right up here to the left. How can you be sure? Did you hear it? The train whistle, I remember it, I heard a train. Right up here. [pump exploding] Oh my God. Too late. JIM: He can't be far. He's on foot. Hey Doc, you got it right for once. How you doing Mike? This is my game, my rules. I only let you think you were making the rules, Doc. That's very good Philip. I think it won't be long before you can leave the hospital for good. PHILIP: Never! Forget it! Forget the hospital! I ain't never going back Doc, never! Philip, don't start with me. and let's Now kill these two let's get out of here. Or - We're going. - You're crazy! You're crazy! Wait a minute. Philip, Philip, what about the game? Now don't start that. Philip, Philip, you told me we were going to be partners. We're too smart for that, I told you. Wait a minute, what is this we shit? You told me you were willing to kill him yourself. Philip, you know better. You told me that the game was just a joke. That it was a way of controlling Philip like a puppet. Shut the fuck up! Now shut up. We're going. Of course he doesn't believe that. I told you, you can't win Michael. I told you that. You see what I mean Philip? He tells you what to think, he tells you what to do. He controls you Philip. You just believe you're controlling yourself. Doc, I trusted you. I fucking believed you. What's going on? Look! Look at the girl. She's still alive. What's that tell you? I knew you wouldn't kill her. See, you're getting better already. Michael's right. You know, I think you're fucking with me Doc. She's still alive. I want to know why I didn't kill her. You're fucking with my rules! JIM: Oh Philip, that's not true. PHILIP: It's true. You've just been using me. im just a Guinea pig to you. All right, look Philip, why don't we just let these two go, and you and I'll just go somewhere. We'll just play the game, all right? You mean that Mike? You really mean that? For a while. OK. You know, I'm getting really tired of killing anyway. OK, let's go. JIM: No, Philip! No! You must come with me. You must kill these two and return with me to the hospital. Kill them now! No, why don't you kill us? Why does he always do your dirty work? Let's go, we must hurry. PHILIP: Mike, move back. Come on, move back. Deb, get up. Get up, get up. Yeah, Mike, get together. There you go. Real good. Rules. Rules. Kill me Doc. End the game. JIM: Philip, put that gun down. PHILIP: Kill me, Doc. End the game. You stupid, stupid boy. Now I'll have to kill all of you. And I won't have any trouble convincing the authorities that it was you. [ominous music] [gun firing] OK, Philip. Philip, just give me the gun. PHILIP: I won't be needing it anymore. You can have it. [gun firing] [ominous music] MICHAEL: It's OK buddy. The game's over. Yeah. But I'm not sure who won. You, or me. [downbeat music] So, where to now? Oh, I don't know. If-- if you need some work, I think we could probably find something around here for you. Thanks, but I think I'd just as soon get on out of here. Well, you suit yourself. You're free to do what you want. Am I? [downbeat music] ADAMS: Take a deep breath. You're not just breathing fresh air anymore. You're breathing freedom.
