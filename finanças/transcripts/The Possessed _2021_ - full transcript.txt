No. I need this Cass, do you give me permission? No, we don't! I know you're in there Carissa, I need you to give me permission to clear you. She doesn't give you permission. Come on Cass, you know what to do, I need to hear you voice. I know you can hear me, Cass. Hey, do me a favor and give me permission. No, she does not give permission! Yes, yes, yeah, yes, I, Carissa Chandler, give you permission. Thank you. Whose body is this? Whose body is this? No, no, no, we were just playing with you, she doesn't give permission. Answer me, whose body is this? Fuck off! Whose body is this? Hey, look at us asshole! Whose body is this? It's ours! Whose body is this? Fuck you! - Whose body is this? - Fuck you! Stop. This body is ours and you can't have it. You lie. This is not your body, demon. I command you to leave! Leave, demon! Leave now! Leave now, demon! You need to fight, Carissa, you need to evict this parasite from your body! Fuck off! This one is ours. Help me, Jacob, please. Shut up, bitch! Whose body is this? Talk to me, Carissa. Whose body is this? Its mine! This is Carissa body, this body is mine, get out of me, demon, this is my body! You okay, huh? I'm here. I'm here for you, come here, come here, come here. I won't let them hurt you, I promise. I won't let them hurt you. I love you. Bloody dog. Hey, Cass! Hey. Hello, Aunty Carissa! Hey, love, sorry, I didn't hear you. Good to see you. You after Jacob? Yeah, is he around? Yeah, yeah, he's just down at Dino's workshop. Okay, all right, I'll go say hello then. Okay. Um, Aunt Cass? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine, just a big night, too much wine. Okay, well, I'll go see what Jacob's up to. Okay. Hey, love? You reckon you could remind him to get to the bottle shop for me? Yeah. You know you'll never get the old girl running again. Miracles happen, you know. What are you doing down our way? I'm just heading into town so I thought I'd drop in and see my favorite uncle. Yeah, I thought you were a bit dressed for a visit, go grab yourself a beer. Yeah, nah, a few of the boys are going into town so I thought I'd catch up with them, tag along. Yeah, well I call bullshit because I know why you're going to the clubs and it's not to see your mates it's to see that shit hot DJ chick isn't it, hey? Hey, got you in one? Good on ya, mate, so when do I get to meet the lovely lady, -what's her name again? -Atalie, and soon. - Natalie eh? -No, Atalie, Atalie, no N, only an A, Atalie. She hates when people get it wrong. Duly noted, Atalie, At-a-lie, well, that's a bit different. Yeah, it's different. I can't wait to meet her. Yeah, she's amazing. I think she's got a few demons that could do with some clearing though. Haven't we all, eh? You know, Uncle Jacob, I don't mean to pry but, why is Aunty Case's arms all bandaged up? I mean, your house looks like a cyclone just tore through it. Did something happen last night? I know I can trust you to keep it to yourself, but, your Aunty made another attempt on her life again last night. Bad? Yeah, bud, it's bad, I can't seem to stop them attacking her and every time I clear her, it lasts for a few weeks and then they're attacking her again, you know, and I got to tell ya, it's getting stronger. There's something bad going on. It's like she's a magnet to the fucking things. So, what happened? Is she okay? I mean, what, did she cut herself? Yeah, but it wasn't too deep. It was a bloody good thing that I turned up when I did, thank Christ. So why are you limping? Oh, I trod on a bit of glass, eh, look its nothing, not too bad, it's all right. Uncle Jacob, have you ever thought that maybe we're not doing this right? I mean have you ever thought maybe we should just stop, I mean, we could be the reason all this is happening to Aunty Cass. Look, of course I fucking do, you know that. I mean, did I fix her manic depression or did I remove her demons? Have I brought the demons home to the manic depressive? I don't know. If I stay, will I make it worse? If I go, will she die? Probably. You know, look, I got this calling, a calling from God. This is my mission, this is what I have to do. Yeah, but at what cost? Because I don't think you or Aunty Cass can keep doing this. Yeah, yeah, I know, and the possessions are getting worse. I mean that demon last night, well, I got to tell ya, I've never seen anything like it. It was big and it was more powerful than anything I've had to deal with, and you weren't there to help me, and then Saf rings up and she tells us we're booked for another bloody clearing this week. That's four in one month. Two this week including Aunty Cass, we've never had four in a month before. Yeah, yeah, I know, it's a first and... Hey, you know what? I get this feeling that something really bad is going to happen soon, you know, really bad, something big's coming. What? I don't know, it's just a gut feeling, I wish I knew, bud. Hey, don't you worry about me and Aunty Cass, we'll be fine. You go out and have a good time and you tell Atalie I said hello and I wanna meet her ASAP. Yeah, I will, actually I got to shoot off now because I want to catch her before she jumps on stage but, Aunty Cass wanted me to remind you to go to the bottle-o but between you and me, she could do a night or two without it, okay? Oh, have a good time and remember if you don't want an infection, you've got to -wear protection! -Wear protection! -I'm not 18 anymore, Uncle Jacob, but thank you. -Yeah, I know mate. -See ya. -See ya, mate. Come on babe, its time. There she is! Nadine, how's the doco coming, have you got enough footage yet? Not until I get my one on one time with Atalie's favorite guy. How you doing, buddy? Hey, I'm very, very good. Okay, mate, personal space. Relax, mate. Stop, stop! So, babe, what was with that psycho scream at the end of your set tonight? It was great touch, FYI. I saw them again. No way, are you sure you just weren't really drunk, babe? I mean, I'm not judging, I'm jealous. Ow, what? What do you mean, you saw them again? Who's them? Oh my God, I can't believe she hasn't told you yet. -Told me what? -Little miss party girl here has a freaky little dark side. Atalie, what's he talking about, babe? Fine. I'm not crazy, okay? Just remember that. Since I was like, six or something I've been able to see things. What do you mean things, like ghosts? No, not ghost more like, um, monsters or demons. I mean, at least I think they're demons, I'm not exactly sure what I'm seeing. When did this start? It goes back as far as I can remember. It's my first real memory and it's kind of traumatic. I used to live just up the road from here before I moved in with my aunt and uncle. My dad, Nicholas Carlisle, who my aunt has always said was a good man but something changed when I was about six. He started drinking and he became really violent, and the he lost his job and my parents couldn't afford to pay their mortgage so... We were getting ready to move and the house was mostly packed, there were boxes everywhere. And then one night he just, lost it. I remember I was sitting on the floor in the hallway and my dad, he seemed so big, it's like he took up the entire space. He was coming down the hallway and it was dark but I remember everything really clearly. His face was pure rage, and he had blood on his cheek but it wasn't his blood, it was my mum's, and he had her hair in his hand and he was dragging her and she was screaming. She was begging him not to hurt me and I... And he got close enough and he looked at me and it wasn't my dad, it was a monster. I mean, it was my dad but it was something else, it was different. The cheeks were different and the eyes were black and teeth... jagged and broken, and the skin was a different color and there was sores everywhere, I mean it was my dad, but it was different. I don't know what to say. What happened to your mum? He took her to the bedroom and... he strangled her. And then my aunt and uncle came over the next day and they found me asleep in the corner and my dad was curled up in bed with Mum, she was dead. Fuck me. I've never heard that story before. You must have needed a butt-load of therapy growing up. You have no idea. I mean they told me it was normal for me to perceive my dad as a monster because in that moment he was one. But, I've always been able to see things, and lately it feels like I see something every second day. Can you see anything right now? I mean, no I can't see anything right now but at the club I saw something. Why, what happened tonight? Well, there was one demon who seemed to want my attention, he knew that I could see him. He was standing right next to Orion and we just stared at each other for a few seconds before he exploded over Orion and his friends and disappeared. Are you seriously trying to tell me that some fugly demon exploded all over me? Well this wouldn't actually be the first time, there was this one time I was on my sex swing-- Orion, we don't want to hear about your sexcapades. All right, since we're all having confession time, I have something to tell you too. The plot thickens. First of all, I believe you Atalie, I do. These things are real and while I haven't seen them myself, I know someone who does and he sees them quite often and, I help him clear demons from people. -Bullshit. -No, I'm 100 percent serious. Who is it? Okay, you know how I told you I work part time in a clinic with my Uncle Jacob? -Yeah. -So, it's a wellness clinic that does massages and clearings. Its kind of like an exorcism where he clears the demons from them. I'm sorry, but can you please explain what you mean by he "kind of performs exorcisms"? Okay, so, a couple of months ago we cleared a lady with a thief demon attached to her. What's a thief demon? -Well. -Sweetheart, we are having a serious Q and A right now, so if you wouldn't mind, skedaddle. Sorry. So, there's this woman, Shania, really successful business woman, ridiculously wealthy, but the problem is for her whole life, she's never been able to go anywhere without stealing something. Will it hurt? You won't feel a thing. I mean, she could walk into a store with enough money to buy everything on the shelves, no problem, but for some reason, she has to steal something. Honey, that's not possession, that's everyday normal shit. Well, no, it's not normal, but I do get what you're trying to say but it's also not possession it's an actual condition, it's called kleptomania. Yeah no, I agree, it is a condition but she has tried absolutely everything, she has seen people, tried everything, nothing works, fortunately for her, one of Jacob's former clients recommended her to us. Shania, do you give me permission to clear you today? Huh? Yeah, I give you permission. You need to say your full name darling. Oh crap, yes I, Shania Wilkins, give you full permission to clear me today. Shania, these are rosary beads for prayer, would you like to hold them? Yeah, its been a while since I've prayed. Close your eyes. Now remember, don't be afraid when you hear noises. Now I'm going to ask repeatedly, "Whose body is this?" And you will reply, "Shania's body," do you understand? Yes. Shania, whose body is this? Shania's body. Perfect, keep answering. Whose body is this? Shania's body. That's it, one more time, again, whose body is this? Shania's body. Easy, you got this. There you are. Piss off, you fraud, I'm not going anywhere! Whose body is this? Whose body is this? Fuck off, fuck off! Fuck off! Whose body is this? You pair of shit wipes! Answer me, whose body is this? This is your body, whose body is this? It's Shania's body! It's my body! Jacob! Jacob, are you okay? Fuck off. Like The Exorcist , spinning heads and all that crap? Kind of, I mean, not really that bad, we do it once or twice every couple of months but for some reason, we don't know why, it's becoming a lot more frequent. Come on, are you guys seriously trying to tell me that you believe that his uncle exorcizes demons for a living and he's like what, he's Harry Potter's apprentice or something? Well dude, what exactly have I got to gain by lying? Are you believing this? Hey, At tie, you said you've been seeing more of these things lately? -Yeah, lots more. -Yeah, we've noticed an increase in possession cases lately too, Uncle Jacob's pretty worried about it. Actually, you know what, you should meet my uncle. I mean, I know he'd love to meet you too. That would be amazing, I mean, you have no idea how much that would mean to me to know that I'm not the only crazy person. Okay, yeah, well, I'm meeting him for breakfast tomorrow at Beans By the Beach, I could introduce you both then? -Tomorrow? -Yeah. Ab-so-freaking-lutely. Oh, I'm so coming too. Are you nervous? No, I'm excited to meet someone who sees the same stuff as I do, it makes me feel like less of a freak. I don't know, I still think you're kind of freaky. Two dudes exorcizing demons as their day job, sounds pretty crazy, right? I mean if I wasn't seeing monsters and demons myself then I guess it would sound pretty crazy. Are you expecting Jacob to be a wack job? Look, I like to see myself as a fairly open-minded person, and I've seen you flip out when you see this shit, so, no, I don't think he's going to be a wack job. Hey, I have been meaning to ask you something. Shoot. Have you ever seen a demon attached to me? No, never. They don't like geeks like you. No, Deeny, please don't, don't, I can't run, I'll barf. I really will. I wish I had my camera. - How you doing? - Hi. Hey. Jacob, this is At a lie. -Oh, really? -Hi, nice to meet you, Jacob. - Nice to meet you. - And this is her best friend who usually has a camera attached to her, Nadine. Jacob, it is so nice to meet you. Liam has told us so much about you. -Oh, have you just? -Only the lies. Where's Orion? It's before 10, there's no way Orion was going to make it, I barely made it myself. - Hey, Skylar! - Hi, Jacob, how are you? I'm doing great, darling, so how are those nightmare's going, all right? Well thanks to you, I haven't had a single one in over a month now. -Glad to hear it. -Can I get you another coffee? No, no, I'm fine but I'm sure my new-found friends here wouldn't mind something. Yeah could I just get an orange juice please? -Yep. -Thank you. And I'll get the big breaky, eggs poached. It won't be long. - On ya. - Thank you. So, Liam's told us a little bit about your clearings, they sound absolutely fascinating. Girl, calm your farm, give the man some breathing room. What? I'm just excited, it's not every day you get to meet a real-life exorcist. Its okay, Atalie, I don't mind talking about it. Have you always been able to see demons? Yeah, although I didn't realize that that's what I as seeing, most of the time there was just shadows, you know. Half the time, I thought it was my mind playing games with me. And when was the first time you cleared a demon, like for real? My first actual clearing was a friend of my wife, Carissa, she came around one day banging on the door, she felt there was something wrong, you know, she begged me to help fix her with a clearing. So, you remember what to do? What the hell is going on? Whose body is this? Do you need to touch me? Because that's okay. No, no, no, no touching, no touching, okay. Angela, could you please, please. And if you could just sit still please? - Mm-hmm. - Thank you. Whose body is this? Yours, it's yours! You can have it, take it! -Take it! -Angela, Angela, no please! Let's try this again. Whose body is this? Whose body is this? It's mine, it's Angela Wilmoth's body! Fuck! Unless you want to fuck me, get you filthy hands off me. And believe it or not, my first clearing, right, I managed to manifest the demon of lust, Asmodeous. Asmodeous, yep. - I'm telling ya. - Oh my God, that is insane. - That's one big demon. - Thanks. - Thank you. -And, if you need anything else, just let me know. - On ya, Skylar. - You all good there babe? Word of advice babe, never come between a hung-over woman and her greasy breakfast. Oh! We got to get going, Liam, we got a client in 20 minutes. Okay, yeah. -Hey, lovely meeting you. -Can we please do this again? I really want to hear more stories. - You're on, you're on. - Nice to meet you Jacob. See you later. Hoo! That was hectic. Yeah, it was. Nadine? You are so gross. Dammit! Have a go at that bloke. Yeah, weird shit. How you going guys? Who was that bloke who just stormed out of here, do you know? He said his name was Martin. Apparently heard about us through a friend, comes in here demands to see the effing priest. I tell him we have no priests, clearly, grabs my favorite pen, writes his number down on Damien's file, and throws a whole bunch of business cards around and storms out. Who referred him, do you know? Nope, you know him? No, I never seen him before. Well, that is his number. -Oh, okay. -Good luck. Ta. How you doing, Saf? I quit. Just this way, guys. Jacob, this is Helen and this is her husband, Damien. So nice to meet you in person. So how have things been since we had our talk on the phone? Things have gotten worse, much worse. It's not that bad. Are you serious? He tried to drown his best friend. You tried to drown your best friend? Well, it's not like I was trying to kill him, -things got out of hand. -Out of hand? Passes it off like it's an accident, but combined with the headaches and the excessive drinking and the marijuana. Just a little pot and booze, you're overreacting. Hey Damien, seeing as you're here, we may as well have a look at you, I mean, you've got nothing to lose right? Huh? Damien, if you could just jump up on the chair, please? Now, I'm going to give you a clearing which is sort of a spiritual cleansing. What have you gotten me into this time? Hey Damien, why don't you just lie down and relax. You don't have to do anything and there'll be no pain, okay, I promise. Now for your safety and mine, we are going to have to restrain you, okay? In order for me to complete this procedure I need to get your permission, okay? So when I ask for it, you have to give me your full name and give me permission, okay? Okay. What's that for? Damien, Damien! Will you give me permission to clear you today? I, Damien McCarthy, give you permission to clear me. Perfect, this shouldn't take too long. Now, when I ask, "Whose body is this?" You respond, "Damien's body," all right? I think I can handle that. It's small but it feels more powerful than it should. That's what she said. I see you, imp. Whose body is this? Whose body is this? Whose body is this? In the name of Jesus Christ, Lord give us strength. Helen you need to ask him, "Whose body is this?" Ask him. What is happening? Hey, you old fuck, got any spare blades? No? That's right, your whore of a wife used them all. Fuck you! Don't you ever hurt my wife, you motherfucker! Helen, come around here, I need you. What do I do, what do I do? Put his hands in there, help me. Jacob, Jacob, Jacob! Jacob! Channel the Roman, channel the Roman! Damien, tell me whose body this is! Let me go, bitch! Don't you ever talk to me like that again! Helen, you have to understand this isn't him, okay, this is the demon. Helen, look at me you need to help him, help your husband. I'm so sorry, honey. Please tell me whose body this is. Damien, you need to fight! Fuck you! Hey! Stop being an asshole and start being the man that I married! Whose body is this? You better answer me, Damien Stephen McCarthy! It's my body. It's Damien's body. Are you okay? I'm fine. Excuse me, excuse me. I don't know what just happened. It's all good, you can go. Honey, are you okay? How do you feel? Groggy, like I just woke up. Hey, Damien, we are going to sit you up now, okay? Ready, one, two, three, up, good, good. We are going to get you off the chair now. That's great, you did great. Go outside, we'll be out with you soon. - Okay. - Okay. Jesus H. Christ, that was insane! An imp shouldn't be that hard, that should have been a fast, simple clearing. I've never dealt with anything like that, ever. Hey, it's all right, you're only human. -Did you get it? -Yeah, I got to get rid of it. I feel weird. My chest is tight and my head's throbbing, you know. Creator, please use this master exorcism template in a divine, ideal way and magnitude to complete clearing of myself. Rescuers of light, this is my body, I have sovereignty over my soul. Creator, complete clearing until I am pure. Thank you. Hello? Hi is this Chandler's Health and Wellness Center? Thank God. Oi, can you get Jacob? Its the wife of the crazy man that came in this morning. Oh yeah, yeah. Jacob. It's the wife of the crazy man that came in this morning. Yes, Jacob is here, I will pop him on for you. Oh, hi, Nancy, this is Jacob Chandler here. Jacob, it's really good to finally talk to you. What can I do to help you? It's my husband, Martin, he's really struggling and I don't know what to do. Do you remember the Larsen family massacre that happened about eight months back, the husband worshiped the devil and killed his wife and kids and then committed suicide? Yeah, I sure do, it was a terrible, terrible tragedy. Well, we live in their house now. Look, something's really wrong and I really need some help and I'm sorry if he was rude because he's not usually like that and I just, I just don't know what else to do. Yeah, look that's okay. Look I'm sorry I missed him. When do you think he might be able to get back into the clinic? I don't think we can get there any time soon, he's... Is there any way you can come to us? To your house? Please, Jacob. Is he coming? Please, Jacob, I need you to come to the house! Of course, I will come to you. Okay. Thank you, thank you so much. He's coming, Martin, he's coming to the house What's your address? It's 1528 Slaughter Road. 1528 Slaughter Road. Yeah, look, I'll be there tomorrow probably after lunch, if something happens between here and then please don't hesitate to call, okay? Thank you, thank you so much for this. Yeah, okay, bye-bye. Okay, bye. Babe? What are you doing? What are you eating? Babe, what the hell are you doing? Do you know what time it is? Deeny? Deeny? What are you doing over there? What the hell babe? Babe, are you all right? Oh, that was sick! Holy shit, Atalie, are you okay? You just flew through the air, like literally flew, and I got it all on camera. What are you doing? Oh. Babe, talk to me? Love you too. Death is here. What are you talking about? What does that mean? What the fuck are you guys doing? What? Hello? Can someone tell me why we are up at this asshole hour of the morning? Jacob. It was right here. What was? Writing in blood and you... There was writing on this wall that said "Death is here." Yeah. All right, we'll be there. Atalie! I've got to go, Jacob's got an emergency. What's wrong? You know that guy I was telling you about, Martin? Shit's really hit the fan, I've never heard him sound like this before. I've got to go. -I'm coming with you. -Oh, I'm coming too. I just need to stop by the clinic, I have to get my Bible. Um, excuse me, I don't know who Martin is or why you need a Bible but I'm actually quite scared so can I please come? Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can come, everyone can come we just have to go, now. Okay, okay. Thanks for coming, mate. I see you bought back-up. Yeah, I guess, everything just happened so fast everyone just kind of jumped on board. -It's good to see you. -You too, mate. -Hey, Jacob. -Good to see you again, love. Hi Jacob, how's it all going? So far so good. Hey listen, I'm not worried about the camera but if Mrs. Philips doesn't want you to turn it on, maybe you'll have to turn it off. Oh my God, yes, no problem at all. You don't look like a preacher. That's because I'm not a preacher, but, I'm pleased to meet ya. Liam, do you want to meet Nancy? Nancy, this is my nephew and assistant, Liam. - Hi. - And his girlfriend, Atalie. At a lie might be able to help, she can connect with demons on a similar level to Jacob. You can see them too? Unfortunately, yes. Oh, and Nadine and Orion. Nadine is something of a documentarian. Hi Nancy, I hope you don't mind if I film tonight, I'm making a documentary with Atalie. That should be fine. Oh good, I promise we won't get in the way. No problems at all. Has anyone got a problem with the dark? Liam, do your friends know exactly what's going on here? Yeah, yeah, I filled them in on the way. Okay, well, to put it bluntly, we are here to clear Martin of an evil that inflicts him. And a couple of hours ago, Martin asked Nancy to restrain him. Sorry, so, let me get this straight. Your hubby is possessed by the devil and you have him chained up in the house. I know this sounds crazy, trust me, I have spent months thinking that I'm going crazy. But once you walk inside that house, once you see Martin, you'll understand. Honestly, I'm not sure how safe this will be for you all so if anyone wants out, by all means, you can leave now. Aren't you frightened? Yeah, a little, but I've got the power of good on my side so let's get in there and see what we've got to face, huh? I thought you said Martin was restrained. -He is. -Then who's that. I don't see anything. Me neither. He's gone now but there was definitely someone there. Fuck this, Liam, I'm out, give me your keys. Yeah, yeah, look, you go home, I'll give you a call when this is all over you come back and pick us up. No, fuck that, you can ride with Jacob or get a taxi. No, no, it's all right, I'll use on board sound -but can you leave that in the car for me? -Sure. Right, are we ready for this? Lets do it. Shit on a stick. -Dude, shh. -What? Shh. There was something out there, it was growling a me. Where's my sound recorder? I must have dropped it, we can get it later. What the fuck was that? I'm out of here, there's monsters everywhere. What the freaky fuck, why won't this door budge? I just came through it. This is stuck too, Liam. This one won't open either. Jacob? This one's stuck too, I don't know what's going on. You're kidding. Has this happened before? -No never. -So, are we suck in here then? Well, I don't know, it never happens. Babe, do you have your phone? I think I left mine at yours. I need a torch or something. No, I left mine in the car. Take mine, just do me a favor and just don't drop it okay. - Thank you. - Righto. Nadine, Orion, I want you to stay down here, the rest of you, I want you to come up with me and check on Martin because I don't him freaking out with a whole lot of people in the room. All right, but if you need us, you'll call for us, right? Of course, we will. Shh. -Okay. -Babe I'm going to need more than just a phone with a torch light. Guys, there's another flashlight in the bottom kitchen draw feel free to grab that, it's just down there. Which room? The room at the end. What is that? It smells like a dead animal. Close, it's the stench of demons. I do have to tell you guys, Martin's not in a good way, he's been getting worse. Last night he was screaming and yelling at me, telling me it was all my fault, he got really aggressive at one point. You got to remember it's not Martin, it's a demon, and they lie to try to get you off your balance. I mean they feed off fear and sorrow. There's something under there. Is Martin still tied up? Yeah, he is. Martin told me to keep it locked. You all stay here for the moment and I'll check it out, okay? Hey, Martin, how you doing? We're here now, mate. It'll be all right. We're here to help you. Oh, Jesus. Jacob, are you okay? -Do you need me to come in? -No, no, not yet. Just stay out there, okay? Ak. A. Man. Ah. Aka Manah. Liam! The pentagram! Don't step inside the circle. Do not step inside this circle! Why, what will happen? I don't know, but I got to say, it's not going to be good, so just don't step inside the bloody circle. Nancy, what the fuck is this? I have no idea. I swear, I have no idea. I stay away from this room, Marty told me to. This is to invoke really evil spirits, this is some really heavy shit right here. Stop, wait put the light back on him. -What did you see? -Give me the torch. -What do you see? -One sec. You see something, Atalie? There, behind Martin, I can see him now. I don't see it. Oh, oh. There he is. What does it look like? Like a shadow or smoke. Atalie, are you okay? Can you hear me? At a lie! Talk to us, Atalie, are you okay? I'm okay, can you open the door and get me out? Hurry up, open, open, open! Nancy, are there keys to the cupboard? -I think Martin used to keep them up top. -Up top Jacob, up top! Liam, there is something in here, please open the door! -I've got them, got them! - Please get me out of here now! We got the keys, babe, hang on! Oh, for Christ sake, give them here. Babe, I'd really like to get out of here now. I like your skin. Got it! There was a fucking demon in there with me. Close the door! Who are you, demon? Answer me! Demon, what is your name? Leave him alone, demon. -Fuck, that was-- -Yeah, it was. Where did it go? Oh, it will be back, its linked to Martin. Nancy, you have to stop this, please, help me. -No! -Don't cross the circle! I have to get to him, he's my husband. Christ! It's okay, it's okay. You two, come with me. It's okay, sweetie. Have you ever seen anything like this before? No, never, babe, are you sure you're okay? Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, it was pretty scary but I'm not hurt. You're going to need this. Is that holy water? Yes. We've never needed holy water for a clearing before. I'm assuming that's not holy water. No. Right. We are in way over our heads, that demon in there is not like anything I've ever dealt with before. And what happened to you, Atalie, that is some powerful demonic activity, and don't forget we saw a soldier demon in there as well. What's a soldier demon? Soldier demons are outside of the body, it's not really a possession. They can control and influence a person but not actually possess them. They do the dirty work for the more powerful demons. In all the clearings I've ever done I've never dealt with anything powerful enough to have soldiers. This is not a clearing. This is a full fucking exorcism. This is the face of hell, I mean you both saw that floor, right? Well, the previous owners, they were into satanic worship, and I'm guessing that in that room, they tried to invoke him. Invoke who? Well, the symbols spelled out Aka Manah. He murdered his family, he killed himself, and that is a potent blood sacrifice which is probably enough to call him, right? Yeah, but what I confused about is why go through the all the trouble to murder your entire family and then kill yourself? I mean it doesn't make any sense. And why is Aka Manah still here? Why hasn't he left yet? Why is he still in that room? Buggered if I know. Maybe the dumb bastard only got half way through the ritual. He did enough to bring Aka Manah to the surface and he killed himself but didn't actually release him into the world. Who is Aka Manah? Maybe that's the demon I saw in the cupboard. I can't say for certain Aka Manah is what you saw but I can tell you that he is one of the most powerful. Aka Manah is the third demon born out of the nine sons of Satan. Now he is cruel and controlling and absolutely obsessed with power and if he's what's inside Martin right now then, fuck. But you can help them, I mean you've never performed a full exorcism before but you know how to, right? He's just another demon. You know what, Atalie, you're right. When it gets down to it, he's just another demon. A very powerful fucking demon but yeah, just another one. So the clearing principle is the same, all right? Martin's still got to give us permission to clear him but we know the name of the demon and that gives us power over him. Assuming that it is Aka Manah. Yeah well I'm going to have to bring out the big guns, aren't I? I found it. Okay. Yes, good job. I swear I just saw something walk past the camera. No, babe, don't do that to me right now. - No, I'm serious. - Don't play games. Look at the cupboard doors. Hey, help. Give it, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. Turn it on. Fuck this, come on, lets go find the others. I want to go home. I promise I will never take electricity for granted again. Please don't tell me something's standing behind me. Nadine! Oh my God! Orion! Orion, wake up! You can still help us, right? Nancy, this makes things difficult. How so? Well firstly, people flying through the room is a strong indication that something powerful is at play here. And this. The star? - Not just a star. - It's a pentagram. See, these symbols are from the Gujarati Script and they are used in the A vest an Alphabet. What does that mean? It flows like Arabic. That's where this demon's from. Ak-a-man-ah. That's the name of this demon, Aka Manah. And going by the pentagram and these symbols, I'd say the previous owners were trying to invoke this demon. So, if it was invoked from wherever it comes from, why is it still in my home? What does it want from us? This is just my theory, right. I think they were trying to bring this demon forth but they hadn't completed the ritual, which means, he hasn't been released yet and he's trapped in this room. -This pentagram. -Yeah, right. So, when Martin came in to renovate, he discovered the pentagram and I think that's when Aka Manah possessed him, which strangely enough, is good news for us because if I can clear Aka Manah from Martin into me than I think I can send him back to hell. What happens if he gets free? Nothing good's going to come from it, depression and anxiety will all rise and suicides... Rape, murder, violent crime will increase. Look, put it this way, we've got to send this bastard back to hell and that is our only fucking option. Deeny, what's wrong? Where's Orion? Whose blood is that? Nadine, Nadine, Nadine, look at me, look at me, breathe. Where is Orion? I don't know what happened, it was dark down in the kitchen, I blacked out for a minute and when I came to, he was unconscious on the floor - and I don't know. - At tie, where are you going? I'm going to check on Orion, we can't just leave him down there. Go with her. Hey, Bible, don't forget the Bible. Orion, what are you doing? Orion? What do you see? Shit, this isn't good. Orion, look at me. Babe, be careful. Shit, I can see him. I mean, I can actually see him. What do we do? Atalie, get a chair, get a chair! Its okay, it's all right. I don't feel so good. It's all right, buddy, you just had a bit too much to eat, all right? What happened, where did he go? I don't know. I'm guessing he jumped into Orion just for a quick snack but, babe, you really seem to be packing some power. Please don't tell me I ate off that floor. Shit, Jacob and Nadine! Jacob! Let him go, you asshole! -Nancy, look at me. -Get away from her! Release her, you bastard! Stop! Let him go, demon, release him! Get away from her now! Fight it, Jacob, you have to fight the demon! Say your name! Say your name, Jacob, fight it! -Hey, get away from her! -Nancy, I just need you to look at me, I can help you. Jacob, you can do this, please say your name! Just look at me. At a lie. Atalie, you've got to release me. Oh, for Christ sake, somebody get me out of this! What? Oh, for fuck sake, will someone please untie me already! Death is here! Death is here for all of you! I fucking hate this house! Untie him, there's nothing happening here any more. -You're sure? -Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. Come on, get me out of this! I love you so much, Martin. Please help me. Nancy, Nancy, you got to fight! Stay back! I'm going to rip your fucking soul to pieces! No way. The bitch is floating. Orion, do something! Get your hands off me, bitch! Go, help them! Don't let her go! Our Father, who art in heaven. Aka Manah! Aka Man ah? Who the fuck is Aka Man ah? Leave this woman's body now! God isn't here, fuck stain! He isn't going to help you! And forgive those who trespass against us. God isn't here. -God isn't here. -You must say, "I, Nancy--" You pitiful fucks don't have a clue who you're dealing with! Come on Nancy, you have to give him permission! You! Yes, you. She thinks you're weak. You're not a man who can fulfill her needs. Give me permission! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you, Aka Manah! No, don't let go! I said don't let her go. Okay, let's get her over here where we can get her better secured. One, two, three. It's okay. It's okay. Atalie, I need you to go get the restraints, okay? Go, now. She's smiling at me. Busted! Liam, grab her! Restrain her! Secure her arms! Put it on her arm! Get your hands off me, you pathetic shit! Her legs, we've got to tie her legs! I've got it, I've got it! So, you like it rough choir boy? Get her legs! Tie her! Get something to tie them! Get back. Get out of the pentagram! Martin, get out of the pentagram! Liam. -Bible and holy water. -Yes. Atalie, your time has come. When I give you a signal, I want you to come into the circle and place your hands on Nancy. I fucking dare you, bitch. Just let me now when. Nancy, give me permission! Nancy, give me permission! I, Nancy Philips, give you permission to clear me. Just kidding, no she doesn't! I need you to help me. Liam, give her the holy water. Atalie. Hey, if you know the Lord's Prayer, now's the time. Our Father. Aka Manah, I command you to leave this woman! I command you to leave her. Bitch! You have to fight it, Nancy! She is gone! I ate her soul! Nancy. Mummy's busy choir boy! I know you're in there, you have to say your name, Nancy. Fuck you! Come, legions of Michael! Come, warriors of light! Join me, gather, join me, gather, march with the force of the angels! Join me now and send this demon back to the face of the sun to burn forever! Ease out this demon! Send him back to hell! Leave now! Leave now! Leave now! Run to the light, Nancy! Martin! Jacob, are you okay? Jacob! Stay back! Nancy. Liam! All right, everyone stay here and make sure Nancy's okay! Stop. Creator, please use this master exorcism template in a divine, ideal way and magnitude to complete clearing of myself. I am of light! This is my body! I take sovereignty of my soul! Creator, continue clearing until I am pure! Thank you! Get out of my body! Fuck you! Its okay, it's okay. You're okay, you're okay. Something's wrong. Something's wrong. It didn't work. What do you mean it didn't work, what are you talking about? There. I sent you to the bowels of the earth! I cast you out! Fuck! Is anyone else super confused tight now? What just happened? I've been doing these clearings for over 20 years, and this should not have happened. I've let the genie out of the bottle. He used us. That motherfucker used each and every one of us. Of course, he needed Jacob to get him outside. So, what you're saying is, we basically finished the ritual for him. Yeah, that's exactly what we're saying. What does this all mean now? It means I set him free. I just don't know why I couldn't send him back to the earth. Maybe you weren't strong enough on your own. Maybe we should have linked arms or something. I've got to find him. Hey, boss. No, we have to find him. We have to find him and we have to send him back to hell. Together. Well done, gang, another successful clearing. We make a pretty good team. Definitely wasn't Aka Manah though. Nah, but we'll find him. Dude, can you please, please stop telling the clients to run to the light, okay? It is not Poltergeist . What? It worked with Aka Manah. It's true. When I said it, Aka Manah left Nancy. -Yeah. -It did! Every time you say it, I wanna leave. Hold up. Hey Saf, how are ya? Yeah, sounds interesting, yeah, send me the address, thanks. We got another one. Saf said it sounds pretty weird, she's sending me the address right now. Aka Manah kind of weird? I don't know, it sounds powerful.
