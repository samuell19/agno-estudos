It is too bad that for a long time now, the funniest things, the saddest things, are but the acts of a fool... Comrades, from now on, there is no more right or left. We're one body and one... Can you hear me back there? Yeah, we can hear you, Picin. Early bird gets the worm. I don't have to explain that. Hooray! Picin? What's this all about? We'll share our possessions. And what will you share with the kolkhoz except your loud mouth? Don't start with me! You only flap your tongue and meddle. This is no time for being touchy, Sabatka. - Take your wealth to your grave. - Quiet! Don't let him lead you on. We won't have some platform shoved down our throats. You want my advice? You want my final advice? Do you or don't you? Giving advice to the cunning... You won't hear another word from me, Sabatka. Do all the tricks you want. Don't expect me to give you a hand. House number 8, Jedlickova, Klara. One milk cow. Thank you, comrade Jedlickova, thank you! House number 11, Skovajs, Alois. 4 cows, 2 horses, 2 pigs. I'm gonna kill him one day. If I don't, you will. Christ Almighty! Thank you, comrade Skovajs. Thank you, comrade Skovajsova. Good man, what should we play for you? Two villages. - Barina, Josef, house number 19... - Josef! One pair of horses, 3 cows, 1 calf. Thank you, comrade Barina. Thank you, comrade Barinova. Sabatka, Jan, house number 22. 3 horses, 5 cows, 2 calves, 3... - Horses with harness! -What next? - We voted for horses with harness! - I didn't vote. - The majority did. Don't try to set the mores. - What if I don't have a harness? - How come? Where would it be? It's been stolen. I don't have it. We'll see about that. It wouldn't occur to anyone to make us some tea. -Konvalinka, Jan... - ... house number 30... - To Konva. To Konvalinka! - Let's go! - Holy Mother of God... - Go back to the car. - Open up! - In the name of the law! People, you're crazy, nobody is allowed in there. - Stop! - Jesus Christ, there were some shots. Ambra, where is Konvalinka? Who was shooting? - Oh God!... - The rascal died a rascal's death. Watch your mouth! Why did he do it? Why? Why? Did he want to run? Where would he go? He didn't want to? - To the train station. - What? For his girl. Who would have thought... That's her. - Who is she? - His daughter. A nun. Good afternoon! Praised be the Lord! Good afternoon. Terrible weather, miss. Blessed Virgin, it's her... Miss... Heavenly Lady, miss... If you only knew, you wouldn't go home. Hell is on fire. Watch out! Watch out! - Ambroz, how much is million plus million? Ambroz, there's a snake in your shoe. Take it out! There's a snake in your other shoe, Ambroz. Ambroz, take it out, quickly! There's a snake in your other shoe, Ambroz. Take it out! Quckly, take it out, Ambroz. Are you thieving? What is it you're selling? You're a thief. Have you seen where a girl's legs grow from? The belly button! Belly button! Your forest is on fire! - Did you pick any nice ones? - Yep. - No one's seen you? - No. Your ears will get frostbite! Aren't you cold? No. Go. Tell the girl to fool around with you a bit. You've got to steal her key, or put your foot in the door. Ambroz, today the little Jesus is being born. Ten. Ten, right? I can't count, I ride horses. I'm a complete idiot. Who doesn't like it, is an ass... You said fifteen, right? Leave me alone. - Who are you messing with? - Screw him. Whoops! - Yes, fifteen. - And what of it? I wrote to the police that there must be a hole in the granary. I'm telling you so you know. So you wouldn't complain I keep things from you. Don't jerk me around! - Listen, Barina... - I hear you, Picin. The guns were supposed to be turned in already two months ago. - What guns are you talking about? - What is there to lose? Adin?dcat'. Elf. Onze. Eleven. Cheers to the worker! Come on. - Are you sweating? - No. Here. Why are you people bickering? The star of Betlehem is about to rise and you're bickering. Tapa, don't bring the church into this. Leave your Catechism at home. I know a thing or two about theology. I'm talking about guns and the granary. I stuff my underpants with wheat. I put wheat into my socks. I'm not going to force you to take my advice. You're old enough to handle this. Wish you stopped freeloading. Don't you ever get tired, Picin? All your functions wear you out, Picin. You lash out at people. If you're tired, Ambroz can take over. Ambroz, how much is million plus million? Get cracking, man! How much is million plus million? Two million... Now you can be the chairman. Christ is born...! You'll get a hankie for Christmas, have it cut into five shirts. You'll be the first to be questioned, Sabatka. I'm already trembling! Guns are a sensitive issue. What are you jabbering about? What guns? Not to worry, you've got good memory. You couldn't find the harness, either. People will tell you what they think. They won't let anyone spit on their views. Anyone! Write to Kremlin that you've got elected as our representative. Shut up. You've got a bottle again? Where have you been since the morning? Now you're going to work? Did you bring straw to the pigpen? You drink this dishwater? What did Klara had you steal this time? What's in your pocket? Give it to me! - Let go! - No. - Give it here! -No. - Hold him! -No. - Look, what have we here? - It's... Stole it from the girl? - Aaaah! - Give it to me! Take it! Jump! Give it to me! - Give it to me! - Catch! Did she wear it above or below the waist? Give it to me! So that's why she hits you in the kisser? - Jump! - Catch! Give it to me! Give it... Catch! - Go! Run! - What if it comes out? - It won't. Fool, you shouldn't let a woman hit you. A woman is not supposed to hit a man. And when you're holding a girl, you idiot, hold on to her. Don't let go. You're a fool. You! You are! I'm not a fool. You are. Bastard. Pig! Pig! You're a pig. You're a pig. I'm not a pig. Karel! Sit down. Giddyup! Want one? Sabatka is a fool. Barina too. Does she pray at night? - She lies on the ground. - Lord... Here. Show me that tatter. There's nothing on her bed? Just bare planks? Giddyup! The hell's on fire... - Whoa! Good day. - Praised be Jesus our Lord. Fifteen sacks. A mix. I'm chilled to the bone. Let me, I'll carry it in for you. Don't strain yourself, miss. There's a lot of sparrows here. Many sparrows this year. It's too heavy for you, miss. It was to heavy for Him, too. Have you found both horse-collars? - Yes. - Did you put them in order? Yes, they're in order. - Can I wash my hands? - Yes. Last time I left my soap here. - I've got some warm water. - Great. You'll stay here. The grain's in the bucket, you'll take it round, then lock up. - I will. - And fill in the vents with straw. No need to always give me a clean one. I can dry off with your towel. Go fill in the vents with straw. You're easily duped. What are you playing with kids for? Screw the little brats. What are you--a fool? - Did they give him a drink? - No. I went to the red barn. It's filled with straw to the ceiling, but I saw your sledge. They covered it up with straw. What do you need the horse-collars for? What do you need the sledge for? Who has the keys to our barn? Picin. In the office? No, at home. All his keys: the sap snores on top of them. Are you going home? I'll give you a ride. No. Filipa! Filipa! Praised be the Lord Jesus Christ. - I need the key to the red barn, Filipa. - But... I'll recognize it. It's the one with a large brass bow. You know, we used to have two. Dad broke one. Don't mention him. Don't even say his name. Don't say his... What do you want from the red barn? Picin's not home? Picin is not here, just me. He didn't break the other key. Someone threw it away. Do you want to know about the red barn? Filipa... You've got a fever. What do you want with the barn? - We've got a sledge there. - What? Today, He is going to be born. We have to welcome him. Like we did when we were kids. Welcome? You'll all go. And Filipa will polish your shoes, warm up the blankets with hot bricks, so that your feet won't get cold along the way. And duvets and fur coats to keep the legs warm, and bells and whistles and some diddly-shit with a ring! He couldn't pray. That's not true. He couldn't even say Our Father. Put back the key. - I'll pray for you, Filipa. - Give back the key! You hear? You'll be forgiven; He forgave everyone. Even those on Golgota who stabbed him in the heart. Picin! Can't you hear Him? Come help me. -Is that all you need, miss? -Yes. Martin, go see the reverend. Tell him I'll come to the midnight mass. - What did she want from you? - Where are you off to? - What did she say? - Where are you hurrying to? Where are you running? - She'll go to the church. - You think? - Surely. - What's that? - Don't step on me! - Nuns are terribly cunning. Look at the sledge. Oh yeah! He came, he's here. Mass should be celebrated in the morning. Midnight masses are ill-advised. Besides, electricity isn't working at the church. And people might get some ideas. Think about that. You must think about that. But we cannot be asleep when He is born again. - Right. - He wants me to come. Sister... I'll try once more. I have to tell the sacristian. - Which one was it? - The one he sent. Right. - Praised be the Lord Jesus Christ. - Now and for ever. Praised be the Lord Jesus Christ. Good afternoon. Your right hand! The right one! Blow your nose! Ambroz! Enough! An animal must eat until it's full. Man eats only as much as he needs to. Lord, all creation sings your praise, and all the saints extol your name. Praise the Lord, all nations. Laud Him, all peoples. For His lovingkindness is great towards us.. And the truth of the Lord is everlasting. Glory be to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be forever. Hail to thee, our Heavenly Mother, our queen. Thou art full of grace! Mary, our Mother, Look upon your servants, our queen! Look upon the sons and daughters of Eve! - Grandma, come home! Dad said you should come home. Step aside! Did you hear?! Aside! Disperse! Don't go in there. What are you waiting for? Go home! Please. - I don't get you. - Picin, where are you going? Martin! Picin, are you caroling? Picin, what do you want from her? What are you after, Picin? What are you doing here? Go home. Waiting for a miracle? For her to perform a miracle? I don't get you. Keep your mouth shut! Grandmas, you'll freeze. - Don't you call anyone grandma. - No one's gradnma to you! Don't think you're free to do as you please! Go home, mothers. We'll put the sledge back in the barn. You don't have to clean it. Go to bed or you'll catch your death. - Don't poke your nose into others' affairs. - Who are you trying to get? You won't get anyone. Grandma, don't be afraid. - Go, go. - He won't get anyone. Leave everyone alone! We could get the sledge in the morning, right? Screw it. Let it go. Do you need it? It's not the sledge. It's the principle. What are you staring at? Watch it, Picin! Shut up. Are you out of your mind? Are you out of your mind? - Are you out of your mind?! - Come on. Let's go. Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of mercy, hail, our life, our sweetness, and our hope! To you do we cry, poor banished children of Eve! To you do we send up our sighs! Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God! Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God! O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary! Get up! He's going to fetch the horse. You'll see he's going to. Lord, have mercy on us! Jesus, hear our prayers! Jesus, hear our prayers. - Jesus, son of the living God... - ...have mercy on us. - Jesus, brightness of eternal light... - ...have mercy on us. - Jesus, King of glory... - ..have mercy on us. - Jesus, the sun of justice... - ...have mercy on us. - Jesus, father of the world to come... - ...have mercy on us. - Jesus, God almighty... - ...have mercy on us. - Prokop? - Prokop. Pray for us. - Jesus, most obedient... - ...have mercy on us. - She's wearing only sandals. - She's barefoot. - She's barefoot. - She's got only sandals. - Jesus, infinite goodness... - ...have mercy on us. - Jesus, strength of martyrs... - ...have mercy on us. - Jesus, lover of us.... - ..have mercy... - Where are you going? You cannot stand in the way of the Lord. Jesus, zealous lover of souls... - Where are you taking them? - He is guiding them. - Jesus, example of virtues... - Go back! Why are you talking to her while she is praying? - Shall we drag them away? - Don't be a fool. - Don't be an idiot. -Give us your blessing. You cannot give blessings, sister. You're not allowed to give the holy blessing, sister. Why are you so afraid? - Jesus, purity of virgins... - She took off her sandals. - She's completely barefoot. - Jesus, angel of great council... Sister, come to the church. - Jesus, most patient and merciful... - ...have mercy on us. Let's go to the church. I will celebrate the holy mass. God awaits us in His temple. - Jesus, holy temple of God... - ...have mercy on us. Open up! Open up! Harness the horses and groom them, so that there's not a single grain of dust in their manes. Wouldn't you rather go back home home? In the morning, you will feel like laughing. I have only one house. And Jesus whom I chose, will judge my deeds. Christ chose us, and not we--Him. There will always be eager interpreters of signs and words, to whom the true meaning shall remain hidden. Drop the whip. I cannot come to the Lord through another's suffering. Neither a man's nor an animal's. Maybe it's time we harnessed our horses. What if it's not the time? Who harnesses will unharness. My man, will we get our cows back, too? - You had one cow. - She calved. The calf's grown into a heifer. Wasn't it you who first brought her all decked in ribbons? May God bless our house. May God Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit bless this house. - Bless my house. - And ours, too. Virgin, so that he grows healthy and strong. May he grow to be a man like He was a man. Barin's. A rifle. Another! Don't recognize. Third one. Fourth. A rifle and a hand gun. Comrades, they took the horses. Sabatka, Barina, Skovajs, and Vitasek: they've taken all the horses. - They broke the gate. - Whore! - Stop it. - You tore the gate down with them. - Stop it. They'll go to the church. - They took the sledge from the barn. - Go! - Picin! - Picin! - Picin, start praying. - Come out, Picin! - Come out, you mole! - We want to speak with you! - Come out, you bastard! - Go to the church. - Giddyup! Picin, iron your pants, so you look nice in your grave. - Go! - Giddyup! The bell stopped ringing. - Where is Filipa? - At home. - She's in bed sick. - Why are the lights out? Turned off. So that everyone thinks she's not there. You've never been at our house? I put a tree outside your door. Ninth. We'll be at the church. Open up! I don't want to go there, dad. We're not going because we want to. Open up! Filipa, can you hear me? Filipa! What's up, Punticek? What's wrong? Don't be afraid. It's only a spruce tree. Are you asleep? Filipa... Whoa! Picin? Quiet! Picin! Don't be afraid of Sabatka. The villagers have turned the place into a circus. - Can you see the tree, Picin? We can see it, Sabata. Someone is there. Filipa? You'll get a beating! We'll pound you head in! - Aren't they behind the barn? - They ran away. Gone. - They must be behind the barn. - Karel, go have a look. Here. Run! Is anyone there? - Can you see anyone? - No. I can't. - Who knows where he went. - He must have shat in his pants. Giddyup! Music that's too loud and song that's unsuitable won't please our Lord. Joy can be expressed in many ways that won't offend Him. How do you know, daughter, what may offend our Lord, and what will be received with pleasure? He told me. - Filipa? - Who? Filipa. Do you want Anna to clean Filipa? Get dressed. Filipa has put it all behind now. That one. We who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh. - You see the blood? - She's got blood on her feet. - It's Christ's blood. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body. None of the deeds you've done to any of those he has chosen, shall be forgotten. That's not in the Book. There are things written in books, and things not written in books. I'm present in Him and He is present in me. They'll freeze to death. Let them freeze. Her skin is smooth. She had a calm death. She died in her sleep. Otherwise, she wouldn't have such skin. Now she's in heaven, Picin. She lived through hell with Konvalinka. Now she's in heaven. But you don't believe in that any more. There are even no candles to give the dead a smooth passage. Why are they having a mass at midnight? No one knows anything around here. Poor thing... She must feel bad that she can't even wash the dishes. Picin, do you want to keep Filipa home till tomorrow? Leave her at home, Gusta. Until after the holidays. - What will you do here by yourself? - How much do I owe you, Gusta? You'll pay me afterwards, after the funeral. God be with you. Christ! The bell! Where are you going? Don't provoke them, Picin. They've got guns, don't be a fool! I won't provoke them. I'll kill them. Your immorality is the worst of all. You stretched your arms to Him with your harlot soul. You made you face up and put perfume on for tonight. They say that under your robes you're dressed like a floozie. Put your shoes on! And get out! Unhitch the horses! Stop! Stop! Move a step closer. - Picin! Let me shoot him. Please let me kill him. You wouldn't. I would gladly. I'll kill you and leave you lying here. - You'll go to jail, you fool. - Picin! - What's that, the black thing? - A raven. - It would have to be the size of a horse. - Some black rag then. - Shouldn't we go and have a look? - We're ready! Come, we don't have time for nonsense. Let's go! subtitles by kostej (2009) revised/retranslated by aileverte [2010]
