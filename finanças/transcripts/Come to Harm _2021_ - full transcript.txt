You were calling? -Yes honey, can you help me? Let me see. Alright... Thanks, darling. When are you leaving? -He is coming to pick me up. Do I need to pull him aside and ask him about past times or? No, nothing like that. I need to get to know my new dad. -Oliver, stop it. I'm joking. -I know honey. Our man is right on time. -Can you let him in for me? Everything for your majesty. And mom... You look amazing. Thanks, love. Nothing is working out. Nothing's working out. This is your fault. This is all your fault! I hate you. I fucking hate you! I fucking hate you! Excuse me, we're closed. Let me see. Does it hurt? -No, no. You'd be surprised how many people fall down these stairs. This is almost a part time job. This is the best I can do... But... I would have it checked, if I were you. Do you want water? No... And why are you sitting at my bar? If I can ask? Rough night? Yes... A little rough. I'm looking for my brother. Is he lost? Yeah. And... have you called the police? What's your name? -Freyja. Freyja... Can I tell you something? My mom had me when she was young... Very young. And my dad took up a habit of abusing me every day. When he came home from work... ...the bar, it didn't matter. When I came home from school... I used to see my mom lying on the ground. He was beating her. No reason or... He just did it. One morning when I woke up to screaming. I thought it was just another day... And I knew what would happen. I walked out of my room and... There he lied on the ground... Heart attack. Mom, just stood there, and we watched. We didn't do anything. Just watched him die. Where did you get that photo? His name is Hrafn, my brother. Light, white hair. Innocent. You must've seen him. I can't let this happen to him... Please... What're you doing? Are you okay? He doesn't speak Icelandic. I'm sorry. Hrafn. This is not your fault. This is not your fault, okay? It's gonna be alright. -Okay. Aren't you hungry? Where is mom? I just need to rest for a while. You've got to trust me. Get out, and run. Run until you find someone, okay? Where's mom? You have to just trust me... Hi. Yeah, yes. I just need to go home and take a shower. Yes, I need a shower I don't want to be... Yes. Okay... Love you, yeah bye. Hello? What's up, kiddo? How are you? I'm good. -Yeah? So you're gonna sit in the front? Did you talk to them by any chance? Alright, okay. Thanks. No problem. Wait here, I'm gonna... Check things out. You'll maybe go to the back seat meanwhile. So I won't get a ticket. Okay? I brought a new candle. I've been saving up money but it's hard. Natan bought it for me. I've already said thanks. I'm alone most of the time. I... I'm sorry how long It's been. I sometimes talk to the people but... They just wanna talk about boring things like school and... I'm going to ask Natan if he can pick me up more often. Maybe once a week. I don't know... Oliver always said that gas is expensive and I don't have any money. I think maybe Natan is cold now. ...So I'm gonna leave. They don't want me coming over here, but I'm still going to try. Bye. Stefán? Are you there? Krummi, is it you? Krummi, answer me. Hrafn? Come to Harm
