Am looking I'm thinking what will they react to it We certainly should pay attention to them Excuse me, captain Herbivore like potato, they are happy But for us, carnivore, how could we eat potato? Is there anything for us on the menu? I'm thinking about the problem. Let me think Sheep are shivering in front of wolives When cats prey, rats shiver Creeping animals like to eat hoptoads They live together It's not easy Everything must be changed Or our lives will be deteriorated If you don't oppress your aspirations then we no longer exist We can't survive If you don't oppress your aspirations For carnivore, it's natural To eat Herbivore It's standard rule If you deny, you are madman Before the flood It's unblamable But now everything must be changed Or lives will die out We can't survive Wait, captain! You mean we can't eat meat? Nor a piece of chicken? Nor a piece of chicken! I know potatoes are difficult for you, but it's the only way We all need to survive Be patient Blood won't last long We are the only survivers, just like Noah's Ark? I'm not clear, I can't see anything else If nobody remains on the earth, whom will you marry with? I won't tell you even if I know the answer You are so... I know whom I will marry with There is something strange there Where? A black thing on the water You are right A wood or something No, wait chelonian! Are you sure? A large chelonian! I go to tell grandpa! Hurry, she is in the wrong direction What's up? She saw chelonian Grandpa! Tom! Hurry She grasps the life buoy! I bet they will get it on the ship What's up? You know! You are allergic to chelonian, by the way Can't you move there? It's fine there! How can I? No space If that's your opinion I just explain it Don't you see I'm blocked? What a bad mood are you today! I'm sorry I think we are too late Poor grandpa, is she really dead? Look?? She has no fim Somebody attacked her Little chelonian, open your eyes Open your eyes She isn't dead, she is still alive She is still alive Stand aside Give her some fresh air Where am I? We save you You are in our ship What's matter with you? Crocodile?? Everywhere I just left I'm too tired Can't you see she is hungry? Bring her something to eat, come on You saved me Let her stay alone She need rest When shall we find the continent, grandpa? No one can tell It takes some time to absorb the water I hate this. So do I I can't wait the absorbability Can't you try some spells, Juliette? I like it, but never use it A falling star, make a wish, Tom I know, I hope flood retreat earlier Idiot, it's no use when you say it out Where does falling star come from? You know it, my child Space is not empty There are many gravels and rocks floating around the earth Some are large, others are small They are called meteorite Sometimes When the earth cross them Falling stars are very fast They rush to the space, abrade and fire Just like a match So they radiate? Smart child... No, these falling stars have a secret Billions years ago When the first falling star cross the universe Arrive in our planet Some strange things happened Just like space is makeing love with the earth These maculas were produced Bring us the first seed That's how it begins We are all offsprings of the great falling star Are you feeling better? Yes, I come back We shouldn't leave you alone like that You are so kind, dear, how old are you? Me? I'm 9 And you? You are very old, aren't you? Not too old what are they talking about, mom? No??

It's us, carnivore Who are the gangsters in the grouind? The guys over there Calm down Who can provide it to you? All the tigers and men Is it you, Tom? Yes Where is Lili? She has new friend She doesn't play with me any more Sometimes, girls need a space for themselives They need to talk about something we don't care about My god! It's so small The sky is low Pass me the two-handed hammer. Here you are, Grandpa Thanks Come in, ok? Where, now still Breakfast is ready, come and eat! Potato again Only potato Can I eat yours?

No one can tell it Time is lapsing But I believe, one day The flood will go away Flood goes away, then our lives restart Are you sure? No I can't ensure anything Yes, I can ensure one thing That is: I love you forever Our lives will never end Roger? Have you ever thought of...? Sometimes, in the morning What do you think of? Death, idiot! Death?? Why do you want me to think now? Do you hear they said we are the only surviver The only surviver? What do you think it is after someone is dead? After death? How could I know?
