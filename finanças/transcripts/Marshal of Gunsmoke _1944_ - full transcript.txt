There's nothing to be a-scared about. It's only Pete Larkin and his boys having a little fun. There you are, Mr. Bailey. Hope you'll find Gunsmoke to your liking. Thank you. Ward Bailey came in on that stage. Ward Bailey? -Who sent for him? -I don't know. Lon Curtiss better hurry up and get back here, or we're in for trouble. Listen, you... cross-eyed horn toad. Why don't you look where you're going? You lop-eared lobster, why don't you go where you're looking? Go on, you brother. You asked for it. Hey, break it up, boys. Break it up. What's going on here? You mind your own business... why, Mr. Bailey. Hello, Nuggett. How's mining? Oh, just fine. Glow-Worm, old pal, I want you to meet Ward Bailey. -Not the Ward Bailey? -Uh-huh. The marshal of Deadwood? who cleaned up Tombstone? Well, glad to know you, Mr. Bailey. How are you, Glow-Worm? Say, maybe you could tell me where I could find the Merchants & Miners Bank. Merchant Miners? Sure. You go right up that street three blocks, cross a little bridge, turn to the left until you come a little church on the corner. And it's right... Say, what am I talking about? I'm a stranger here, too. It's right over there. Much obliged. Hey, that's Ward Bailey. Oh, stop your joshing. Here. Go get yourself a drink. -Hello, Ward. -Sam. Come in. We've all been waiting for you. Gentlemen, I want you to meet Ward Bailey. -This is Clem Anderson. -Anderson. -Ezra Peters. -How do you do, sir? -And Ed Gardner. -Mr. Gardner. -Glad to know you. -These are the committeemen -I wrote you about. -Oh, yes. -Sit down. -Thank you. Well, you know why we sent for you. You've got the job of cleaning up this town. Well, from what I've seen, that's rather a large order. It has to be done. Gunsmoke was a peaceful, unincorporated cattle district before silver was discovered and Lon Curtiss and his gang took over. And it's still unincorporated, because every time the citizens get ready to vote for a township, they're intimidated by that outfit. And the result is, the election just fizzles out. When are you to hold your next election? Just as soon as we can get Curtiss and his men out of the way and organize a Law and Order Party. Lon Curtiss has a mighty bad reputation in the southwest, and he's plenty smart, Sam. Yes. We ran him out of Tombstone a few years ago. Where does he make his headquarters? Well, he's in the east right now, but his gunmen hang out at the Palace D'Or Saloon. Well, if we could get them behind bars while he's away, maybe it'd give the town a chance to vote in the territorial charter. That would allow the committee to put in a mayor, a city council, and hire enough peace officers to run this district fair and honest. And until that time, you'd be the only law in Gunsmoke. Provided, of course, you'll accept the marshal's appointment we secured for you from Federal Judge Brown. Okay. Yeah. Did the judge send a badge along to go with the letter? Yes, well... I think about the first thing we should do is to have a gun-toting law. We'll get some notices printed and put 'em up. Good. Twenty-one in the red! Whoopee! I ain't never been so lucky in all my life! Well, I guess that about breaks the bank. I'm a-quittin'. Huh? Well, I'm a-startin'. Step up, folks. Glow-Worm Johnson's great discovery. It cures corns, chilblains, headaches, stomachaches, fallen arches, and dandruff. Can't fool me, faker. I bought a bottle of this stuff from a fella last year. Before I could get it to my mouth, it'd eat the bottom out of a tin cup. Yeah? Well, you don't drink this stuff, cousin. It's electricity. -I never even heard of it. -Me, neither. You never heard of it? You've heard of lightning, ain't you? -Who ain't? -There's a bolt of it right in this gadget. Take a hold of it, friend. I'll show you. Go ahead. it won't hurt you. A little treatment. A demonstration, folks. Here we go. Are you ready? -Invigorating, ain't it? -Must be powerful. That's the first time I've seen Spike grin in 20 years. Why, you little shrimp. Little shrimp? Them's fighting words where I come from. Fighting words where you come from? Yeah, that's why I moved. Is that so? I'm going to shove this gadget down your throat. -Now, wait a minute-- -Hold it, Spike. You can do your fighting some other time. Thanks very much. It's showtime, folks. So get ready for the treat of the day. Presenting the Palace D'Or's own beautiful prima donna... Miss Ellen Carey. Sundown trail Where are you leading to? Coyotes wail I know they're feeling blue So am I 'Neath a hazy sky Waiting On the sundown trail Sundown trail What will tomorrow bring? Hear that quail The flutter of his wing Guess his mate Is arriving late Somewhere On the sundown trail Blanket me with moonlight All night long Sprinkle me with stardust So rare And where is that someone To kiss me good night? Someone who could learn To care Sundown trail When will our journey end? Skies are pale Down where the willows bend Soon I'll dream By a peaceful stream Somewhere On the sundown trail Blanket me with moonlight All night long Sprinkle me with stardust So rare And where is that someone To kiss me good night? Someone who could Learn to care Sundown trail When will our journey end? Skies are pale Down where the willows bend Soon I'll dream By a peaceful stream Somewhere On the sundown trail Ward Bailey, I'm so glad to see you. Hello, Ellen. You're just as pretty as ever. Oh, find an empty table someplace and sit down. I'll be with you in a moment. Where do you get that stuff, Bailey, signing yourself marshal of Gunsmoke? The Law and Order Committee arranged that appointment, Larkin. No appointment is legal in this burg unless Lon Curtiss puts his John Henry on it. Ward Bailey's appointment happens to have been signed by Judge Brown of the federal court. And I intend to enforce every law that the committee decides to adopt. Take off your gun. Check it with the bartender. That goes for everybody else in this room. That ain't legal. You can't get away with this. Nobody's going to get my gun. Now you're talking, boys. Maybe we can get this new marshal to hand out some hymn books. Probably do you all a lot of good. Now, check in your guns. If you think you're going to make a gun-toting law stick, you're crazy. Hold it, Larkin. Thank you, Glow-Worm. Get his gun. Give it to the bartender. Now get up. Larkin, the next time anything like this happens, you and your gang will spend about ten days in jail. All the rest of you men, check your guns with the bartender. All of you. This is a good start, Marshal. You certainly took on a job for yourself, Ward. Well, somebody's got to do it. Say, have you heard from Tom lately? -Last month. -What'd he have to say? Well, he just won an important criminal case, received a fee of $5,000. Well, that's fine, but I knew he'd make good. You know, I'm kind of proud of that kid brother of mine, Ellen. You haven't heard from him? Oh, he hardly ever writes to me. Why'd you ask? He's on his way to Gunsmoke right now. We're going to be married as soon as he gets here. What? I'll knock his ears down for holding out on me this way. Mr. Bailey? Beg pardon, ma'am, but I got to speak to the marshal. Oh. Excuse me, Ellen. I'll see you later on. Mr. Marshal, I just saw Larkin and a couple of his men uncheck their guns and follow Nuggett Newcomb out of the saloon. Nuggett made quite a killing at the roulette a while ago, and I'm worried about him. Well, we'll have a look around. That's why I unchecked my gun. There goes Nuggett. I don't see any sign of Larkin. Well, just the same, I'm betting him and his cutthroats are up to no good. You mount up, and keep your eye on Nuggett. I'll get a horse and meet you on the trail. I'll catch up with you. Get up. Back to your horses. What happened, Ward? Nuggett Newcomb was just held up and murdered. -Murdered? -Gardner... you lock these two men up. All right, men, get off your horses. Sam, we're going to have to look up Pete Larkin. He's the one that did the killing. -How do you know? -I saw him. He dropped his neckerchief when he started to rob Nuggett. -Well, let's get him. -Yeah, what are we waiting for? Now, just a minute, boys. This is a matter for the law to handle. Can I go with you? No, you stay here, Glow-Worm. We'll need a live witness to testify against Larkin. You're it. Western skies are heavy As I ride along the glade Singing through The twilight My saddle serenade Though the night Be slowly falling There's no need To be afraid As long as I've a pony And my saddle serenade Western skies are heavy As I ride along the glade Singing through The twilight My saddle serenade Though the night Be slowly falling There's no need To be afraid As long as I've a pony And my saddle serenade You think Nevada and Burns will talk? Why should they? They know Lon Curtiss will spring them as soon as he gets back. Howdy, Marshal. Still trying to enforce your gun-toting law? I'm after you on a more serious charge this time, Larkin. You're under arrest for killing Nuggett Newcomb. All right, line up. Get their guns, Mr. Garret. You got nothing on me and Spike. We'll let a federal judge decide that. Sam, get word to the territorial governor. Tell him to send Judge Brown here for a quick trial. I certainly will. With you and your gang locked up, it'll give us a chance to organize the voters and get them behind the election to incorporate Gunsmoke. This is a frame-up to get me and my friends out of the way during the voting. You've got to let us have a lawyer. You can have two or three of them if you want, not that it'll do you any good. Jack, wire Lon Curtiss about our troubles. He left Springfield last week on the steamer St. Joe, so you ought to be able to reach him in Plainfield. This way out, gentlemen. Well, everybody happy? Card. Jack to you. Nine to you. Another spade's to you. And a pair of treys to the dealer. Message for you, Mr. Curtiss. We picked it up at Plainfield. Thank you. Pardon me, gentlemen. Well, those pair of treys are worth about 500. Raise you 1,000. I'll call, and I'll raise you 2,000. Will you take a personal check? I'm out of chips. Well, I might if the signature's good. My card. Thomas J. Bailey, attorney at law, St. Louis, Missouri. Oh, you're the young lawyer that defended that state senator last month and got him acquitted. I read all about you in the papers. Of course I'll take your check. This trip business or pleasure? A little of both. Mr. Curtiss. That was a nice game we had, Mr. Bailey. But you ought to know you can't beat three treys with a pair of aces. -Yeah, I found that out. -How much you lose? -Only my girl. -Your girl? I don't understand. I came out west to get her. Been planning and working for two years so we could get married. Now I'm right back where I started. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know that was all the money you had when you signed that check. Forget it. I'll tell her the truth and, well, if she breaks the engagement I'll have no one to blame but myself. Say, perhaps you could handle a legal matter for me and make enough money to take care of things. You mean, you need an attorney? Well, no, but some business associates of mine do. They were framed in a murder charge by a crooked political setup. The trial's to be held in Gunsmoke. Gunsmoke? That's a coincidence. That's where I'm headed. Well, then, you wouldn't have to go out of your way to handle it. Now, if you take the case, there's $2,500 in it for you, $500 now and the balance payable if you get them acquitted. Well, I'll do the best I can, Mr. Curtiss. -Thank you very much. -Well, you're entirely welcome. Come on. We'll have a drink to it. That is, to the bride and groom. -Well, hello. -Hello. Welcome home! -How was the trip? -Oh, just fine. Say, looks like she stood you up. Tom. Ellen. Oh, it's good to see you. Oh, hello, Mr. Curtiss. Well, hello, Ellen. Say, young fella, I didn't know you were going to come to Gunsmoke to take away the star of my show. -You didn't ask me. -Well, congratulations anyway. See you down at the Palace D'Or in a little while. I'll be there. -Guess who's in town. -Who? Ward. And he's the new marshal here. Well, he ought to make a good one. Say, is he the one that arrested that Pete Larkin? Yes. Larkin and his men killed a miner. Ward intends to see that they're brought to trial and convicted. Say, why don't you talk to Judge Brown? Maybe you can handle the prosecution. I-I couldn't do that. Where's Ward now? Well, I guess he's over in the bank helping Mr. Garret get things ready for the election. Tell him I'll be over in a little while. I've got some business to talk over with Mr. Curtiss. But you haven't seen your brother for several years, Tom. Well, I'll see him in a little while. And you, too. There you are. You can take this one away now. Hey, Glow-Worm! I told you. Ain't nobody going to monkey with these ballot boxes as long as I'm around. Ward... I don't know what to think of Tom. He seemed so upset to learn you were marshal here and that you had been the one to arrest Larkin and his friends. Oh, don't worry about it, Ellen. But he just said he had business with Curtiss. Could it be something about the trial? Ah, Tom's too smart to get mixed up with a man like Curtiss. -Hello, Ward. -Tom. I'm sure glad to see you. Didn't expect to find you at Gunsmoke. Well, you never can tell where I'm liable to show up. Meet Sam Garret, Ed Gardner, Glow-Worm Johnson. This is my brother, Tom. -How do you do? -How do you do? I've been waiting for you, Mr. Curtiss. -Reckon you've heard the news. -That's why I returned. Oh, Mr. Curtiss has retained me to represent some of his business associates. They've been in jail for the past two weeks, and I understand they're being held without bail. Well, your information is correct, Tom. Don't you think you should have consulted me before agreeing to take this case? I'm an attorney, Ward. My business is to defend accused people who, according to the law, are innocent till proven guilty. Mr. Curtiss's associates have as much right to legal counsel as anyone else. Well, no one is denying their legal rights. But Larkin and his gang are known to head the lawless element in this district under the supervision of Mr. Curtiss here. That's rather a strong accusation, Mr. Marshal. Have you proof? Just because a man has a bad reputation doesn't necessarily make him guilty. They're accused of murder, and the court has an eyewitness to prove it. We'll argue that at the trial, Ward. Quiet! Remember, you're on the witness stand. Sit down. Ohh. I'm not going to sit here and be insulted, Judge. No two-bit lawyer's going to call me a vagabond quack. I'm a wizard of electricity. If the court don't believe I can cure all the things I say I can, I'll prove it. Any more outbursts from you and I'll fine you for contempt of court. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. That's all. Your Honor, at this time, I'd like to introduce a new witness. Dewey Saunders, will you take the stand? Raise your right hand. You solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God? -I do. -Be seated. Your name is Dewey Saunders? It is. Mr. Saunders, do you recognize any of the defendants as Peter Larkin? Yeah, that's him over there, sitting next to Spike. Mr. Saunders, will you tell the court in your own words exactly when and were you last saw Peter Larkin? Well, it was September 10th. I remember, because it's my birthday. Larkin came to my house at a quarter past 4:00 in the afternoon. And, uh, when did he leave? Oh, about, uh, 6:00. Took me that long to fetch his shooting iron. I'm a gunsmith. Your Honor, Glow-Worm Johnson, the very questionable witness for the prosecution, has testified that approximately at 5:00 p.m. on the afternoon of September the 10th, he sat on a rearing horse 50 yards away from a buckboard and saw a man he thought looked like Peter Larkin shoot and kill Nuggett Newcomb. Now, on the other hand, a reputable businessman of the town has testified that Larkin was with him at the time designated. Saunders is a lying snake! -I saw him! -Quiet, please. Sit down. The other four defendants, with a charge of aiding and abetting Larkin, are held on pure circumstantial evidence. The town marshal has testified under oath that he actually did not see the holdup nor the killing. In fairness to the accused men that have thrown themselves upon the mercy of the court, I demand that they be released and all charges against them dismissed. -I object, Your Honor. -Objection overruled. Case dismissed for lack of evidence. A brilliant piece of work. Just a moment, folks. Tomorrow's election day. Starting at 10:00 in the morning, entertainment and drinks will be served free at the Palace D'Or. We've got to celebrate our certain victory at the polls in grand style. Wait a minute. Just because the Curtiss gang has been turned loose by the court is no sign they're taking this town over again. I'm closing the Palace D'Or bar until after the election. In that event, we'll hold the party at my hacienda. So come early. You're all welcome, and bring all the friends you like. Now maybe we'll have a chance to get together and make a few friends. I've hardly seen you since I arrived. Tom, I'm no longer interested in your plans. But, Ellen, I've only done what any other lawyer would have done. Every person's entitled to a defense. I hate to admit it, Ellen, but Tom's right. Sorry, Ward. Someday, maybe you two will see things my way. And maybe someday you'll realize what you've done to this community. Curtiss and his men will stop at nothing to keep honest people from voting tomorrow. Your song is like a swallow -Your arms -Your charms Were meant just for me And where you go We'll follow Thank you very much, Ellen. That was very lovely. Now, folks, you're all having a good time here, but I want you to stop and think what Gunsmoke is gonna be like if Sam Garret and his Bluenoses win this election. Now, if I were you, I'd go back to town and vote against them. That's right, boys. You heard what he said, didn't you? Ellen... you've got to let me explain. Action's explanations enough, Tom. But you work for Lon Curtiss. Is it any worse for me to accept money for legal services? I've kept my job because I had to make a living. I've had nothing to do with Lon Curtiss or his crooked dealings. Maybe he's not as crooked as people say. Every successful businessman is bound to have enemies. I don't think your brother would have condemned Lon Curtiss unless he'd had pretty good reason. If you want proof, take a look at that poker game over there. My saddle serenade... Two of clubs. Seven of spades. Two of hearts. Queen of clubs. King is high. I call it. Cards. Seven of hearts. Three of hearts. Pair of queens. You have queens or higher, Larkin? $5,000. That beats me. That's not enough. I'm calling you... and betting 10,000 more. That's what you offered me for my mining claim, and there's the deed. You must have the third ten in the hole, Dry Creek. It'll cost you to find out. The claim's worth the size of the bet, Pete. Better get him a pen and ink. He'll have to endorse it, Nevada. Here you are, Dry Creek. Get away from me. All right. Go ahead, and deal them. Wait a minute. Better have another look at your hole card. Larkin just changed it. You dirty snake. It was self-defense. Everybody saw him go for his gun first. That's right. Dry Creek started reaching. He had a good reason to go for his gun. That ink was deliberately spilled so Larkin could change his hole card. I think you're imagining things, Tom. I'm not blind. Now I'm going to see how you happened to win all my money on the riverboat. I wouldn't say that. Everybody here knows that my games are honest. You've got me all wrong. I've had you wrong about a lot of things, Curtiss. But things are going to be different now. I'm going into town to help Ward and Garret run you and your gang out of town. Anybody else feels the same way about it, come on in to town. We'll vote for Law and Order. We're with you, Tom. Rather impulsive young man. Why didn't you let me plug him? And cause the rest of these voters to turn against us? Use your head. I have an idea that'll hurt Tom Bailey a lot more than a bullet. -Saunders. -Yeah. Here's Tom Bailey's check for $2,000, made out to cash. Take it to town, endorse it, get the money, and then beat it. You mean I can keep the 2,000? I sure do. That's your pay for the phony testimony you gave at the trial. Well, I never thought anybody would ever have to pay me for leaving this part of the country, but I'm on my way. Maybe I'm dumb, Lon, but how is that check going to get back at the Baileys? When Sam Garret gets ahold of that check endorsed by Saunders, signed by Tom Bailey, he'll figure that our surprise witness was bribed with Tom paying off, and that's a rather serious offense. I get you, Lon. It'd be funny to have the marshal arrest his own brother, wouldn't it? Oh, Ellen. Could I talk to you a minute? I rather imagine you heard what we were talking about. I did. Well, that's too bad. Watch her, Burns. Don't let her leave here. Now, no harm will come to you. You'll be allowed to go home after the election. Then whatever you say won't make any difference. Take her in the house. Pete, ride to Gunsmoke. As soon as Saunders cashes that check and leaves, get rid of him. Bring the money back here. Right. As I was walking one morning For pleasure I met a cowpuncher A-riding along His hat was throwed back His spurs was a-jingling And as he come near me He was singing this song Get along, little dogies It's your misfortune And none of my own Get along, get along Thank you, Henry. For you know Wyoming Will be your new home Some boys go up the trail For pleasure But that's where They've got it Most awfully wrong But nobody knows The trouble they give us As we go a-driving them All along Get along, little dogies It's your misfortune And none of my own Get along, get along For you know Wyoming Will be your new home Very good, Ward. According to my figures, we're still ahead. Well, that's fine. Now if the ballots from Railhead and Turkey Creek get in here in time, we should win by a fairly large majority. What about the Big Sandy district? Those votes are being cast at the Palace D'Or polling booth. I'm afraid we're going to lose Big Sandy. Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that. Glow-Worm and Peters are in charge of the voting there. Yeah? Glow-Worm can smell a stolen ballot a mile off. You just turn it fast, like that, you see? Then the stuff comes out there. Well, hello, Spike. You're kind of taking on a little weight, ain't you? Shut up. I'm ready to vote. Give me my ballot. -What's your name? -Spike. No, no, your real name. Percival Turkel Cassidy. Percival Turkel Cassidy. Oh, I'm sorry, Percival. Let me pick it up for you. Here you are. Here's your ballot. Oh! Let go of my hand! Turn that thing off! Look at that. Ballots. Look at that. Look at the ballots. From West Forkston. And all got cross marks after "No." Say, there must be a lot of new citizens moved into the Forks recent. The last count was five whites and one Injun. I'll learn you to trick me. Wait a minute. You're not supposed to be carrying this. I'd better turn it over to the marshal. Why, you... -Much obliged, Tom. -It's all right. Where's Ward? He's across the street at Garret's office. You better keep an eye on him. Thank you. Hope you voted right. You get your ballot right over here, Saunders. Why, I've already voted. I want to get a check cashed. Well, the bank's not doing business today on account of the election. I'm leaving town, and I've got to have some money. Well, maybe Garret will do you the favor. I'll take it in to him and see. Where did you get this check? What's it to you? It's good, ain't it? I'll say it's good. It's good to prove that Tom Bailey bribed you to lie at Larkin's trial. Take a look at this, Anderson. Give me that check. Drop that gun, and reach. I'll have to take that .45. How did this happen, Tom? I come in and saw Saunders hold up the bank. I told him to drop the gun. He turned and took a shot at me. I guess I was a little better shot. I don't suppose you'd know anything about this check he was trying to cash. -Is this your signature? -Yes, but that had nothing-- It looks like a plain case of bribery to me. Tom bribed Saunders to testify at the trial of Larkin and his gang. Then when he came here and saw him trying to cash the check, shot him to keep him from talking. I didn't give that check to Saunders. I gave that check to Lon Curtiss for a gambling debt. I owed it to him on my trip out here. That's why I didn't drop the Larkin defense when I found out you were fighting him. I didn't want you or Ellen to know about it. I should have known you had a good reason for your actions. Well, I don't believe him, and I don't think Judge Brown will, either, when he comes up for trial. I'm inclined to agree with you, Ed. Well, you'll have to arrest him, Ward. If he's innocent, he can prove it. I don't guess there's anything else I can do. We'll have to take you in, Tom. I could have gotten him if you hadn't grabbed me. Shooting an unarmed man in the back isn't a very good example of the law and order you're fighting for, Sam. He's a murderer, and you deliberately let him get away. He's not guilty until proven so, Ed. I'll bring Tom back... and see that he gets a fair trial. You won't have anything to do with the trial. You're turning in your badge. Get some men, and go after him. Let's follow him, men! Are you serious about me turning in the badge? I certainly am. Then you're making a big mistake. This badge came from Judge Brown, and you can't pin it on anyone else. That means there'll be no law in Gunsmoke until after the election. The town would be better off with no marshal than one who lets Curtiss's hired killers escape. Ever since your brother came out here and defended Larkin and his gang, you've alibied him. I heard about the excitement. Do you reckon Tom's as guilty as they say? He said he was framed, Glow-Worm, and I believe him. Well, that's good enough for me. Where's your badge? Oh. Garret asked me to turn it in. Oh, that's bad. When Curtiss hears about it, he'll bust this burg wide open. Well, Gunsmoke's not the only place where there'll be excitement. Tom's probably headed to the hacienda to force a confession out of Curtiss. And he's not packing a gun. Well, he headed out of town in the wrong direction, then. Well, he's smart enough to know that a posse would be on his heels. He'll shake them and then head for Curtiss's ranch. Well, what's holding us back? There's work to be done. Tom Bailey walked into the bank when Saunders was trying to cash that check and plugged him. Well, that saves you the trouble, Pete. Did the marshal have to arrest his own brother? We didn't stick around long enough to find out. How's the election coming? It's going plenty bad for us. We've got to stop that Railhead and Turkey Creek vote from coming in on the afternoon stage. In that case, we'd better take a ride out to Lone Valley and get the rest of the boys to put on their Indian outfits. They can ambush that stage, destroy those ballots, and nobody'd be the wiser. Think we can get away with that kind of a stunt, Lon? Why, certainly. Why not? We've done it before, and nobody suspected. And while a bunch of phony Indians are knocking off that stage, we'd be sitting in Gunsmoke right under Marshal Bailey's nose, and the Indians will get the blame for it. Now, if anybody comes looking for that Carey girl, you know what to do. Tom! Ward! Where's Curtiss? He's gone into Lone Valley. Why'd he have you locked up in there? He's planning to have his men hold up the Railhead stage, destroy the ballots, and he and Larkin are going into town. What else has been going on around here? I saw him give your check to Saunders so it would look like you paid him to lie at the trial. That's all the evidence we need. Come on. We'd better get out of here. Glow-Worm, you ride in to Railhead. Get the ballot boxes. Be sure they're in Gunsmoke before the polls close. Drive the stagecoach yourself if you have to. We'll go into town, round up Curtiss and his gang. -Who's ahead, Spike? -We are. Most of the voters come over to our side after Garret took Ward Bailey's badge away from him. You mean that Gunsmoke hasn't a marshal now? Yup. Ward's accused of letting his brother escape after the shooting in the bank. Hey, wait a minute. Are you a Law and Order voter? Throw him out of town. What do you think you're doing, Curtiss? We're taking over this election, going to run it our way. Grab that ballot box, and take it over to the bank. But you can't do that. You-- Pick up that box. Pick it up! Fellas, we won't let another gagman in town to vote. Block those streets. Take those barrels and boxes. Take that team. Block that side street. The rest of you fellas, go on down the road there. Take that group on the horse! Block off that street there! Do you know what I says to the judge? I says to the judge, "Paying alimony's like buying oat for a dead horse." That's when I thought the judge was going to explode. He liked that-- Whoa! Hey! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on here, Peters? Curtiss and his men chased us out of town and barricaded the street. Ed Gardner would send all our fighting men out to look for you. I can prove that Tom's innocent of the charges against him. We haven't time to argue about who's right or wrong. That's right. We've got to run Curtiss out of Gunsmoke so that the other voters can cast the ballots before it's too late. Come on, Tom. We've got to try to get into town and break that barricade. Then you and your men can attack. Maybe Gardner and his posse will get back in time to help you. -Right. -You stay here, Ellen. Oh, hey! That won't do you any good, Curtiss. -Those votes are tabulated. -Yeah? Well, they're all going up in smoke, along with your hopes for a town charter. You're mistaken, Curtiss. Thanks, Ward.

All right, get on your feet. Get up. Out the door. Come on. Whoa. Get in there. Go on. They got all the men. Charge them, men. Well, you won this round, Bailey, but you'll never win the election, not without the Railhead votes, and they'll never get here. We'll see about that. Clear the way! Runaway stage! Well, I made it. Here's your ballots. He made it. 5-9-4. 5-0-2. -We won! -By 92 votes. You've just witnessed an honest count, Mr. Curtiss. Ed, take them back to jail. As soon as the town charter's legally recognized, we'll have Tom prosecute them, put them away where they belong. By all means. I'd like to suggest Mr. Garret here as your first mayor. -Good idea. -Hooray! Don't stand there gawking. Do something. Well, we can't touch it nowhere. Why don't you stop turning the crank? I can't. It's short-circuited.
