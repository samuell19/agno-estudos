Napoleon! Napoleon! Ah, hello, sweetie. Give Rosana a kiss. -How are you? -Hello, Rosana. -Let's go see the cuckoo! -Is my mother upstairs? -Yes, ma'am. -Mom! Mom, we're here! Ugh, the stains from the damp. It's disgusting. And your husband? He's very busy at work. He's not coming for now. Lift me up. Pick me up. Pick me up. -What's wrong? -I think it's stuck. Girls! Come up and give your grandmother a kiss! Grandfather went out to catch squid, one night with Manolo. In the Tramuntana. They lit the lamps, and waited for hours and hours. But there were no squid that night. Because they were hiding from the shark. Then grandfather felt a big weight on the end of the rod and started to pull and pull, but the squid was too heavy. He called Manolo to help him, but not even the two of them together were able to pull out that heavy squid. Nora, please, get the dog down. The giant squid started to pull the boat and took them further and further away from the shore, they could no longer see land. But grandfather didn't want to let go of the squid because he was very stubborn. Then in the end, after many hours, the squid was getting tired and started to come up, very quickly, and then they saw that it wasn't a giant squid. It was a white shark. Then the shark... -The... -Shark, Mom. The shark... Then the shark... started to pull again and Manolo wanted to cut the line, but your grandfather said no, that he wasn't going home without the shark. So they went on waiting all night until the sun came up and they could see land. The next day they realized they'd reached Majorca. Then what? Then they killed it. Yes, I know that. But that's not how you tell the story. Paula. Paula, put the tooth away. Put it away. Mom. Tell them to leave. Mom... Mom. Mom, we're here. -You told it very well. -Leave me alone. Go away. -Where's Rosana? -Girls, let's leave... -Get out! -Yes, yes, yes. Let's let Grandma rest. -We'll come back later. -What's wrong, Miss Angela? I'm here. There? Is that better? It's alright, Mom. If he doesn't come, it's his loss. Listen, Nora. I promise you that if I ever lose my mind and you get someone to look after me, I'll never love them more than I love you. -Ready? -Yes, everything's ready. But look at me. -What language are they speaking? -Your cousins? French. But if you don't understand, just say, "I don't understand. I want to play." -How's your father, Manuel? -Manolo? He's strong as an ox, man. He'd beat you arm wrestling even with a broken arm. So, how was Bora Bora yesterday? -Bora Bora? -Yes. -It closed two years ago. -No way. -Bora Bora closed? -Salva ran it, do you remember? -How's the hangover? -Let me put some sunscreen on you. The sun is really beating down today. Don't drown us, OK? -No, everything's under control. -You burn easily. We get so blotchy. Mommy, have you seen any jellyfish? -Want to look for sea urchins? -No. Why not? Because I don't feel like it. -You're so boring. -And you're a pain. -You've got boobs. -So do you and you shouldn't. No fucking way, it's August. I think it's coming from the Russians' house. I think it's from over there. Down below. No, no, no. It's from behind the court. Listen, listen. No, it's coming from the French, they're constantly remodeling. No, from behind. They're doing renovations. What do you mean from behind? It's coming from over there, clear as day. With a camp counselor? I mean, I guess he's the boss if he's the counselor. Count how long I can stay under doing a handstand. -Alright. -What were you wearing? -Can you hear? -There's an echo in the court. Echo? What echo? You studied physics or what? French kissing? ...seven, eight... What about your braces? Look, a girl! I got to go. I'll call you later, OK? I'll show you your room. -Come on. -I'll take that. Got it, got it! -It's mine, mine! -Go! Good. They need reinforcements, right? When's your father coming, Nora? -Santi? He's full of himself. -What? Ten years without seeing her daughter. She must have been five when she left her to come here. Yes, it's tough. I don't know if I could. No, I couldn't. Too hard. Well, I'm so glad you told her to come here. -It was a great idea, Teresa. -Yeah. Well, it's the least I could do. After so many years with Rosana... -I don't know, you look tired. -No way! It's a big house. There's plenty of space. She can spend the summer here. Good one! What's her name? -Libertad. -What a pretty name. -You like it? -Yes. -She doesn't. -Who did she live with before? By herself? No. With her grandma. I mean, my mother. And who does your mother live with now? My mother... My mother died, my love. Look, it's done. Can you do me one too? -Yes. Why did she die? Go and brush your teeth, my love. -Your hair is so long. -Yes, and poofy. -No, it's pretty. -I don't like it. I do. Girls, it's your father. He wants to talk to you. Me, me, me! -Let's see... -Daddy! Very well. I'm getting ready for bed now. Will you take us to see the slides at Costa Caribe? Bring it to me when you're done. Ready, miss. I'm going to go down on every slide. -I want one too. -And with no floaties on. -Come here, then. Let's see... Yes... I've got my pajamas on, I've brushed my teeth and I got my hair braided. Rosana. What do I care? I'm not staying in this house, much less with these people. Wait until summer's over. Then we'll go find an apartment for the two of us. We can look for an apartment, but in Colombia, because I'm not staying here. No, Libertad. -Not in Colombia. -You're a liar. You don't keep your promises. Everything you say is shit. Come on, they're waiting for us. Let's go. We go on the boat every day. -I don't feel like it today. -There was no problem last year. No one will know you're using a tampon. I don't know how to put it in. What? But I showed you. It's the easiest thing in the world. You just have to relax. -No, no. -Come on... I want to stay here. You can't be embarrassed about everything. Miss Teresa. -Why don't you leave her with me? -No. Yes, I'll stay with Rosana. Are you sure? -Fine, but just for today, OK? -Yes. See you later. I'll miss you. -Thank you, Rosana. -Not at all. Don't let her make more work for you. For now, sure. Very big, very pretty and all, but... Can you see it from here? Always magnificent, baby. Sure, but bitch, this is no holiday. So what did your cousin say? So, I stay with her for three months until you feel like sending me the money. I'm stuck here in this shit. What did he say? Aren't you going to swim? I can't hear. Rude. Nora! Nora, have you seen your grandmother? She's run off again. Oh, my God... I mean, you're having fun, not me. She's over there, over there, Nora! Over there. Grandma! Grandma, where are you going? -To the beach. They're waiting for me. -No one's waiting, Grandma. -Leave me alone. -Miss Angela. What happened? Oh, Rosana. Where have you been? I was looking for you. Come on, we have a lot of work in the house. Oh, OK... Accidentally, Marie Antoinette stepped on the executioner's foot as he led her to the guillotine. -Do you know what she said? -She said, "I'm sorry." Not so much, not so much. She said, "Excuse me, sir. It was an accident." That's manners. That's class. Oh, Lola Flores. You like her, don't you? That's it. Don't move, don't move. There. ...for your freedom What sorrow, sorrow, sorrow... -Hey! -Olé! Olé! -Come on, Ricki, get moving. -Olé! Oh, Mom! Come on, Paula, like Grandma. And... Go on, Nora! -Yes, that's it. -Quit hitting short balls. You play like a girl. Well, well, well... Nora, stay on your toes. Coming! If you want... -You can put a bit of tomato sauce on it. -Get it, Nora. Get it. Let's get going? -Good one! -Pass it here! Good one! Rosana! On your toes, Nora! On your toes! I'm coming. Nora. -One more, let's go. I'm going, I'm going. Where are you going? -Did Rosana send you? -No. My mother. She sent me to town to buy my sister some arm floaties. Where are you going? Home. Home, where? In Colombia. You're going to Colombia? Now? Obviously not. I'm going to get picked up in town. I don't understand. Why are you following me? I'll give you a ride. You'll take ages walking. No, it's fine. I'd rather walk. It's three kilometers. Whatever. OK, wait. Listen, Andrea, I haven't spoken to Johnny. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Hey, easy, easy... Andrea, calm down. I'm asking why. Bitch, no, I've been here more than an hour and nothing. If I hadn't called, I wouldn't have found out. I'm stuck here until you feel like turning up to tell me no. Keep your word, asshole. Did he say why? No. I think that fucker is messing around with someone else. -His cousin told you that? -No. She said he told her we'd broken up. -Shouldn't you talk to him about it? -No way in hell. I'll find another way to get back. Come on, take this one. It doesn't matter. Three euros. Goodbye. Let's go? So, where do you go out around here? I don't know. We never come into town. -Why not? -My mother says it's dangerous. Well, I think it's cool. -Why don't we stay? -It's getting late. Why do you want to get back? To play tennis with your little sister? Come on, just a little while. What's up? -Do you know them? -No. Sure... Not really. He drives my family's boat. -Let's go say hello. -No. -Yes. -No, no, no. -Come on. -Do you want a go? -No, that's OK. -Sure? -Yes. -Go on, jerkoff. Come on, get the first one of your life in. -Come on, stick your butt out. -You busted the club. -Hey, José, another round? -No. What's up? Peque, Peque, Peque. Peque, come here. Now Manu will lose and pay you. Like hell. -Don't sweat it, José, dude. -Here you go, boss. -What are you doing in town? -I've never seen you round here. -I brought her. How do you know each other? We're friends. -Do you spend the summer here too? -Of course. -Enough summer talk, let's play. -Summer... -Come on. -Manu, hey. -Let's see you miss it. -Learn from the captain. -If you miss, you pay. -54 euros. "Learn from the captain." No answer. Look how dark it is. -Oh my goodness. -Oh my god, Nora. Why? Miss Teresa. There they are. Nora. What on earth? Where have you been? We got a flat tire, that's why we're late. -Are you alright? Yeah? -Yeah. It's so late. How come you were riding the same bike? Libertad, you can take any bike, there's plenty here. Honey, are you alright? Sure? Call me. Call me if you're going to be late, if the tire bursts... I'll come pick you up. Should we go for a swim? It's so hot. No, I don't feel like it. You go. -Don't you want to go to the rocks? -No. You want to stay here with Manuel? -It's not that, Nora. -What then? -There are creatures in the sea. -What creatures? Whales and fish. There are no whales here. Well, then there'll be other creatures, and I don't want to go in. -Hey, look, a hot tub! -Let's see? -How about we try with just one floatie? -Paula! -You're not ready yet? -Paula, hot tub, look! Let's see. Good job! -Yes... -What are you doing? Stop it, Paula! She knew the whole thing. Mom understands what she wants to understand and that's it. What do you mean? -She pretends she's crazy sometimes. -She doesn't pretend. It's Alzheimer's... -I know she has Alzheimer's. -Now she speaks her mind more. -It gives her outbursts of honesty. -She gets it right too. When does she do that? What... What has she revealed? The other day she said Dad was an unbearable man. -It's true. -And she's right. -Really? -Yes. -Did she really say that? -She's been saying it since he died. How about we take her to the beach this afternoon? OK, sure. Who are we taking to the beach? Mom. But, how are we going to take... Last time she almost drowned. Toni, please. We can't take her to the beach. I don't know, if we all help her... -We can't help her. -She wants to swim in the sea. -She's obsessed. -She's fragile. It could be dangerous. -We're not taking her to the beach. No. -We could give her a float. -Sure... Floaties. -She could have the flamingo. -Look, Manolo. -Good afternoon. -Well, Manolo, at last. -Manolo! -How are you, Manolo? -Teresa. -I've come to see Miss Angela. -She'll be so glad. -How are you? -Well, hanging in there. It's ruined the season for me. My father says she'd get over it if she worked. Working? Oh, come on, that's nonsense. No. Before leaving, my mother threw a salt shaker at my father. -And what happened? -Nothing, she picked up the salt. Oh please, I swear I'm never going to marry any man. Nico. Please, come here. Here. Here. Here. He answered. Great, you hold him. Come here, Nico. Beautiful. Oh... What? What do you want? He wants to walk. You should look after him, because he hates me. Look, look. I don't get paid for it. Look, look, look. Nora, go and keep your grandmother company, can you? Please. Come on, Nico. It's time for a nap. Oh my goodness... You smell so good... Yes. How beautiful the child they carry With flowers, they adore him How beautiful the child they carry With flowers, they adore him Ro, ri, ro, ra Saint Anthony is leaving Ro, ri, ro, ra Yes. Saint Anthony is leaving I'd give him one, I'd give him two One for the child, and one for you No, the shape is more open, like this... It's kind of small on me. I'm not sure about it, it's sort of wide here, like The Mamas and The Papas, like a tent. Where are you going? I don't know yet. Right? It's like... -It's... It's almost right. -I like it. It's different. Really? I mean, the color is... The color perks it up, doesn't it? -It's like... The cut too. -You look very pretty. Really? I don't know. It's not bad, but... But it's a change, it's a change. Because... Come in. You know what? These colors... Look at you. You go to the market as well? Yes, of course. -Ah. Excuse me. -Well, we have good taste. -Yes. -If you say so. Excuse me. -Yes. We have good taste. Well, it's not right for now anyway. Is it? -Don't take it off. It suits you. -Yes, yes. It does! OK, it suits me, but it's not... Not... It wouldn't be... I mean, if... I'll wear it some other time. Right now... Not for going out. -Who are you going with? -Oh, Nora, you want to know everything. You can't know everything. -Well, it's just you never go out. -What do you mean? Sure, I go out. I go out. What do you mean? Sometimes I go out... I do go out. Not without Dad. You've made friends with Libertad, haven't you? That's good. Because she's... She hasn't had an easy life. -I like it. Yes. -Why? She grew up without her mommy. Just imagine, and in a very dangerous place. I'm going to talk to Rodés. See if we can get her a scholarship to St. Hilarion's next year. OK. Yes. No? It matches. Believe me, you look really good. I mean, divine. I don't know. My dress looks good on you too. You look like a different person. Really? Like... "Oh, Manuel, moor the boat and give me a massage, please." Really? What's this? What? My city's music. Come on, dance with me. I'll show you, don't worry. Let's see... Ready? First put your right leg forward, then to the center and the left one back. -Ready? -Alright. One, two, three. -Right! -OK, OK, OK. OK, OK, now. One, two, three. And again. Forward... -Like that? -Perfect. Let's see, dancing together. The same, but with me. Ready? -You stepped on me! On purpose. -No I didn't! -Again. -OK, I'll get it this time. One, two, three, no? One, two. One, two, three. Oh! Look at her leading. -Now, turn. -Ah! OK, OK. -Beautiful. -Now you. So, which of us turns? That's not how you dance salsa. Just saying. Again? I'm glad you stayed. No, I'm glad you're here, otherwise I'd be so bored. I'm sorry about your grandmother. Come here, let me wipe the shine off your face. OK, OK, just a little. Perfect. What are you doing? -It's like... -You're going to dance like this. Nora, can you get me a drink, please? -What do you want? -Anything. Wait, I'll go with you. Boss! Do you like vodka and lemon? One rum and coke and two vodkas and lemon. Manu works for your family, doesn't he? Yes. He says your grandmother is a little off. She loses it sometimes, right? She's got Alzheimer's. Mine says she's ready to die. What? -She says she's ready to die. -Who? -My grandmother. Have you seen Manu? He's not wasting any time. I'll be right back. Nora... I was looking everywhere for you. What did you do? Why did you leave without me? You were with Manuel. I don't know. So? Your lipstick's smudged. A lot? -Can I wipe it here? -No. No. -No, I'm really tired, honestly. -What's wrong? It's your shirt. No. Stop it. I'm sorry. -Stop. -Now, now. -Can I sleep here? -No. -Why not? -Well, alright. Your bed is softer. Alright. OK, but be quiet. But I'm not talking loudly. Hey, ow... Don't hit me. How come you're hitting me? Bully. Nora... Nora, I'm scared. -Hold me. -No. -Yes. -I don't want to. Nora... How did it go with Moha? Libertad. Libertad. Libertad, please, get up. Get up. Libertad, would you please get up? What are you doing here? Get up. Where did you go to last night? -Get up, please. -Rosana, she was with me. We went to a friend's party. I invited her. Libertad didn't have permission to go out. Permission? All my life I've gone out without telling you where I'm going. My grandmother let me go out. She trusted me, unlike you. Your grandmother? Your grandmother let you do whatever you liked. Your grandmother was a pushover. She didn't even respect me. -Come on, get going. -Alright. Get going, please. You were the one who did what you wanted. You got pregnant with the first man who came by. You never mention that one. I don't know what tales your grandmother told you about me. -Excuse me. -Don't bad mouth my grandma. We were dancing with Libertad. She's a friend. From the estate. Yes. Then I sent her to get a drink and, well, Manuel came up to me... Yeah, it's so crazy. OK. OK, OK. And then, he came up and put his arm around my waist. And I didn't know what to do. Because I was really nervous. And then he kissed me. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. French kiss. You have to inhale it. Have you never smoked? Of course. Trust funders always start smoking later. -What's a 'trust funder'? -A rich kid like you. I'm not a rich kid. Nora, please, my mother works for you. I know, but she's like family, isn't she? What bullshit. Family? She wipes your grandma's butt and none of you do. Being here stresses me out. I need to go. It's not that bad, is it? My mother says it's dangerous where you used to live, that you're better off here. What would she know? I mean... Everyone in my neighborhood is in the streets, they know each other, they're cool... If she went there, they wouldn't even let her in. What do you mean? They don't like outsiders, Nora. Would they let me in? If you went with me, then maybe yes. How do you do that? I'll show you later. -Nora, do you have a boyfriend? -No. What do you mean no? -Yeah, come on, tell us. -Do you, Libertad? Oh, well... No, no. Not me... Nora does, Nora must have someone. Come on, Nora, tell us. Do you have one? -What's his name? -His name is Johnny. -Well, yes. -And you? -Not me. -There, that's it. -One, two... -A photo. Ready. Photo in the pool, girls. What are you doing, are you crazy? Photo in the pool. We're going to dive in, Nora. -No, we're not going in. -Yes. I'll count to three and we jump. -One... -No. -Yes. -No. -Trust me. -Wait! Libertad. Oh, no... Can you come and help me in the kitchen, please? -I'd go, but Nora comes with me. -Libertad. OK, come on. No, no! Ow, ow, ow! Ow! You're hurting me! -Be careful, you're hurting her. -Stop, stop, stop! You're always making trouble. This is awful. You'll go breaking your hair. -And what's more... -Don't you touch me! Nora... How embarrassing, dammit. Come on, now I'll give you... this necklace. Look, this necklace is like a crown. It's grown, hasn't it? A bit. Should I erase the other marks? Try these rings. Go get dressed, Teresa. We'll be late for church. This one with this... Wear the pink dress that Tita gave you. -No, this one... -Yes. Teresa. You look like someone who's wearing lots of jewelry. I'm going to wear lots. I don't like that dress. No, me neither. It's horrible. And now, earrings. But Tita will be there, so... -Do you want these? -No, those are too big. Where's your father? And these? He should be here by now. Should I put them on or will you do it? He's not coming. Why not? Because Mom is with another man. -How would you know? -Because I saw it. Have you been spying on me? Go get dressed, let's go. And tell your brothers to hurry up. Or we're going to be very late. -This one's busted. -Christ. Come on, give it a bit more. -You're going to wreck it. -I understand these things. Right, with the shit bike you've got. -Shut up. Are you starting this again? It's ready for the scrap heap. -Hey, guys. -Hi. -Hello. -Hello. Alright then, let's go. Right, I'll drive. -You'll drive? -Yes. OK then, cool. -Who am I going with? -Here, come with me. I'm taking off. -Is it the first time? -No. -Nora! -Hold tight, this goes fast. -Nora, get off that thing! -Go, go, go. -Nora! Nora, you'll hurt yourself! -Bye! What did you say? Nora! Nora! Let's see a kiss? One kiss. Hey, hey, listen to her. You tell her. -They're jealous. -Jealous. -That's what you are, jealous. -There'll be wedding bells next. What an idiot! He's laughing it up. Come on, hand it over. -I'm stoned. -Dude, leave me alone. Watch your job, man. Better not... -I don't think it's a good idea, hey? -I'm thinking about it. -I'll be gone in a month. -But, how's that? -You're going to quit your job? -I'm leaving in a month. -They're already looking for someone. -Can I work there? No, you're only 15. So? No, man. You have to be, I dunno, 16. It's not that big a deal, bro. I started when I was 14. But that was in Morocco. We're not in Morocco. It was here, idiot. He's from Morocco? -No, Moha is from Girona. -Moha is from Girona, did you hear that? You're a dick, man. That's bullshit. I need money and I can't wait until I'm 16. It's crap. My uncle in Majorca would give you a job. He doesn't care about documents and all that shit. -Well... -It's only a year, isn't it? But I need the money now, not in a year. What for? What would I be doing? -The guy turns, right? -Right. -And suddenly... Three dudes, you know? -Oh, no. In the end, they robbed him. Poor thing. The things that happen to that guy. Where's Majorca? That way. -What are you going to do there? -Work. -No, I don't want any more. You drunks. -No? No. I take groups of tourists. Sailing. It really sucks. But the money's good. -Maybe I could go with and help you. -Really? Yes. And when I'm in Majorca, I can work for your uncle. -That'd be great. Wouldn't it? -Of course. Come on. -Right away. -Really? -Of course. -Deal? Deal, forever. -Come on then. -I'm serious about going. -I mean, we're going. -OK, OK. But first a swim, no? -No, I'm fine here. -Come on, a swim. -No. -You're so boring. Are you really going to go with him? Yes. Liber, come on, it's great. If you want, I'll go back in and make sure there are no whales. It doesn't matter, we'd see a whale from here. A few days before Rosana left me and came here, she took me to see the sea. But we had to take loads of buses because Cali is far away. When we got to the beach, there was a dead whale. It smelt terrible. There were these kids hitting it over and over. -What are you, a moron? -It's warm, isn't it? -You idiot! -What? -It's so cold. -What are you doing? Down. No, no! Stop, stop! No! -Libertad, come on, it's nice. -Liber! -Let's go to the rocks. -I promise, there are no whales. And if there are, I'll kill them all. What are you doing? No! ...climbing Val Thorens ahead by over two minutes, knowing they couldn't stop if they wanted an... We've got to do something about these damp spots. -It gets into my bones. -There goes Turgis... They'll dry out in the breeze, Miss Angela. ...over the other breakaways. And they'll come back next year. And summer after summer after summer... I'll be right back to do your hair. -Is it because of the motorbike? -No. We'll talk about that later. You and I are going to talk. Can you leave us, please? I want to talk to Nora alone. Please, can you leave? I was told you were seen arriving in the port on the boat late last night. -I suppose it was Libertad's idea. -No. No. Manuel is in deep trouble. Let me tell you... -It was my idea. -Nora, please. I'm not stupid, I know you. You wouldn't do something like that. -What, are you protecting them? -Maybe you don't know me so well. If you sneak out again, I'm sending you to Barcelona with your father, got it? And then that's that, because we're having one hell of a summer. And I don't want you hanging out with Libertad anymore. -She's my friend. -What a friend. We welcomed her with open arms, look how she pays us back. It's over. -Like shit it is. -Nora! Who are you to say who gets to be my friend? Who am I? Honey... Listen to me, Libertad and you are too different. Since you've been with her and that crew, you act like a hussy, sweetheart. Maybe I am a hussy. From now on you'll sleep in the children's room with Paula. That way they can keep an eye on you. Maybe you should sleep in the children's room. So they keep an eye on you too. What are you talking about? You're the hussy here. -You're not coming today either? -No, tomorrow. -Careful of the door. -Toni is staying tomorrow. -Let's go to the beach! -Alright. Let's go to the beach! -Babe, want to give him a kiss? -What about you, Superman? -Off you go, have a good time. -See you later. Bye! Can you do my nails again? The same color, or another one? Miss Angela, just a minute, alright? I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Can you do me a favor? Can you watch Miss Angela while I have a shower, please? It'll just be a moment. How are you, Manolo? How's the arm? -Just a minute, Manolo. -Give me your hand. What's up, Manolo? Hello. Please! The floaties. Come on, come on. Paula, come on. Here, here, here. What's wrong? Rosana, what is it? -Mom! -Mom! Maybe she's in the Riu's house. -She can't have gone far. -Have you seen an elderly lady? Come on, this way. Come on! -Come on! -Mom! Angela! Mom! I mean, she was at the end. Wasn't she at the end of the street? She was at the end. When we got there... We've been talking about this all supper, Tere. But, just think what could have happened? -Yes, but nothing happened. It's over. -OK, nothing happened. Right, well from now on, we're going to keep all the doors in the house locked, and that's that. Tere, it's a summer house, everyone's constantly going in and out. And I'm not just blaming Rosana, we're all here to look after Mom. -Right? -You weren't watching her either. OK, I wasn't either. From now on... From now on, we're all going to watch her. -OK? -Right, Ricki, pour some wine, -...let's relax a bit. -Sure, pour a bit more wine. Let's all relax. Let her run off. And we don't have to deal with the hassle of spending a month here lazing around. Right, guys? Because that's what you're doing: lazing around! And Ricki taking Mom's happy pills. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Ricki, man... What about you, Tere? -You take pills too. -Be quiet. -I've seen you. -Be quiet. Those are mine, on prescription. Got it? Those are mine. Nora, sit down please. They'll take your plate. Sit down. What's all this about? I'll explain later. It's not important. So how about we take turns? Yes. Good idea. Yes. Look what I bought you. It's even got data, so you can keep in touch. Thank you. Come here. Again, come on. Do, re, mi, with your hand raised. Like this. I'll go first. Good. Now you. -Starting here? -Here, of course. Starting at do. Do, ti, so. No, no, with this one. -Your fingers go in order... -Where was it? Here. Do, ti, la, so, fa, mi, re, do. See? Very good. But it's confusing. It's complicated, it's complicated. But not confusing. It takes practice. Do. Do. Always put your hand on do. And now... See how you need three? So three fingers. Fa... And now... The descending scale. Are you worried about something? Low ball. Sorry. Yours, Nora. I want to throw a party. Ricki, I want to throw a party for Mom. What? Toni, I want to throw a party for Mom. Like the ones she used to hold at the end of the summer. What? -It's too much trouble. Mom isn't well. -That's exactly why, Ricki. It may be the last summer we can do it. Those parties were epic. You guys remember when Manolo got drunk? -He almost drowned. - He almost drowned? He fell in the pool. What? Come on now. Nora. Come on. -Pay attention. Nora. -Your ball! Shouldn't these chairs be reupholstered? They... They look awful. And I can't find that armchair. -We like this desk. -So do I. Hey guys, the house isn't up for sale yet. We're making an inventory to see what's here, but not to say "I'll take this, I'll take the desk." Say, Rosana. How many folding tables are there? Ten, but one is broken. Oh, good. Can you ask Libertad to separate the broken ones -...and tell us how many there are? -Sure. Now? Yes, thanks. Ten. -How many do you want to invite? -Be right back. I don't know, maybe fifty. What do you think? Fifty, sixty. -How many so far? -Fifteen. Fifteen? Take the other one then... Hello. Hello, everyone. -Hello. Daddy! -Crazy bird! Nora. -Nora... -Hello, Santi. Hey there? -Nora. -I'll set it here. -Santi, how are you? -Hey, how are you? Fine. -How are you? -Fine. -Hello, Angela. -How lovely to see you, Santi. -How are you? -Old. You look as beautiful as always. You've always been my favorite son-in-law. That's easy. You only have one. Hello. Where were you? I was with Manuel. -We're leaving. -For where? Majorca. Tomorrow night on the ferry. -But it's my grandmother's party. -So? -Are you sure it's a good idea? -Yes, Nora. It's annoying how sometimes you sound as bitter as your mother. I don't understand why you want to go. You could go to my school. You're fine here. Libertad. No, Nora. -I'm not staying with Rosana. -Why not? Just because. I'm going to work in Majorca, earn some money and go back to Colombia. -What about Manuel? -What does Manuel matter? You can't go. It's insane. Who's going to stop me? What are you going to do in Majorca? I don't know, but I'm not staying here to work for your family. But you don't have to work for my family. I'll talk to my mother. I don't care what you plan on doing, I'm leaving. Then I'll come with you. Sure. And do what? Work as a waitress, right? -Oh, please. -The same as you. You think I can't? I think life's not that easy, Nora. That's what. Please. You're not going to let me pass? -You really don't get it. -What? That you're a drag and I don't want you to come with me. Manuel might not think the same. You're just a spoiled brat and you'll end up as bitter as your mother. Why don't you get on with your boring life and leave me alone? Nora... Hey... Hey, Nora... My little one. Hey... He's your father and he loves you very much. You have to try. Hello. -Hi, Nora. What are you doing here? -I left my glasses on the boat. Manu will go down and get them for you, alright? There's no hurry. -Don't worry. -Wait, it's not a problem. No, really. Anyway I came to invite you to my grandmother's party. It's tomorrow night. -Yes, your mother told me. I'll be there. You know I wouldn't miss it. She'll be very pleased. Manuel, we'd really like you to come. That's very kind. Especially after the thing with the boat. I can't tomorrow. I'm leaving on the ferry. They're expecting me in Palma on the 29th. Can't you delay it a little? If you're leaving with Libertad, then neither of you will be there. -Who? -Rosana's daughter. What's she got to do with all this? We'd really love for you to be there. I'll see what I can do. -Say thank you to your mother. -It's nothing. You're like family. I don't know. This is it. Yes? Good? Yes? Good? José Mari. Now imitate an animal. Hello. Hello, how are you? Hello. What's your name, squirrel? All done. Here. You have such a narrow waist. I've always been a bit thicker. Maybe you shouldn't eat so much ice cream then, Rosana. Teresa. Teresa, Mom. Teresa. There you are. Look how pretty. Shall I help you with your jewelry? Some earrings? Let's see... -Are you looking forward to the party? -What party? The party. The summer party. Angela's party. I can't go to a party. They're waiting for me. Who? -Who's waiting for you, Mom? -Everyone. -Who? -Javi, Carmen, Tita, Antoni... They're about to arrive. Mom. Mom, listen to me. Look at me. They're gone. They're dead. But we're here, for the party. OK? To be with you. Mom, please, listen to me. I have to go, Rosana. They're waiting for me. Oh, Mom! Nora, Nora, Nora. I've got you, I've got you, Mom. Are you hurt? I'm sorry. Are you hurt? I'm sorry. Teresita. Teresa. Mom. Mom. My child, I don't know... No... I don't understand what's happening. Mom. Sometimes I think I'm losing my mind. I'm here. I'm here with you. We've been very happy here, all these summers, haven't we? Yes. Yes. We've been very happy. Don't cry, silly. Very happy. Seven, eight, nine... ten! You're it! Hey! -Have you seen how pretty she looks? -Beautiful. How could I forget? -This was my dress, when I was young. -Really? -Hey! -Nice to see you. How are you? -You didn't tell me they were coming. -Yes. Mother, do you remember Lourdes? Lourdes and... Salvador. How are you, Salvador? It's a miracle, isn't it? No sign of the Alzheimer's. We should contact a science magazine so they can publish it. Nora. Nora. Libertad, do me a favor. Go to the cellar and get two bottles of this, the ones with this pink label. Go on. Go on, honey. Nora. Nora, hey! Hey, where were you? Yes! Yes! Yes! You look different. What is it? Is it your hair? Your nose? Your mouth? Your cheeks? Maybe it's something in your eyes. Yes. Your eyes. They're... Mom is cheating on you. I saw her making out with a man. Nora, your mother and I are going to get a divorce. What are you doing here, then? I don't know. Where were you going? My child... Rosana! I can't take it. So you were going to leave just like that? Without saying goodbye? You did the same thing. When are you going to forgive me? Rosana, come on! Oh man, Ricki. -You're wasted. -Manolo, Manolo, Manolo, just like you! My goodness... I have to go. It's not your fault. We weren't there for her. Don't think that. Nora. I have to put this on the bed. I'm really sorry about your grandma. You're not angry? Will I see you at school? Nora, we're leaving. See you soon. See you soon. -How far is it? -Not far. Not far? How far? -Two hours. -No, not home. To Costa Caribe. -Paula, we're not going to Costa Caribe. -Why not? Because Mommy is very sad. Come on. -Is everything alright? -Yes. So we're not going to keep Rosana after all. So what's she going to do? She's going to Colombia with Libertad. -But, forever? -Apparently. Let's go.
