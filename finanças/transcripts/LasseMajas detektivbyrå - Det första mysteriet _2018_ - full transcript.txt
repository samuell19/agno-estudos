In a land far, far away, along, long... really long time ago... lived the two remarkable Hammarabi sisters. Although they were quite different, they shared a certain talent: They were experts at solving disputes. The sisters saw diversity as a strength, and helped people see that working together makes us stronger. The story of the Hammarabi sisters might have ended there. But it had only just begun... The sisters' wisdom was collected in the Book of Hammarabi which was gilded by the goldsmith and sent to the King. The King didn't know what to do with this treasure. He kept it in the safest place he could think of: In this venerable old library. Which was a good place for it. Until there was a fire... And the book was gone forever. Or so it was thought. Until many years later, when Tor Leifur stole it during one of his raids. But Tor Leifur wasn't the brainiest Viking afloat, so he didn't appreciate the value of the book. But in the land far, far really far away, it was said the sisters watched over the book from a star in the sky, so that their gift could live on. And so it did! Ever since then, the book is passed on as a trophy for the Hammarabi Competition held in schools all over the world. Ano' now 17's the rum of a place you surely recognise... - Hammarabi Competition in Valleby! - Exactly. Good old Valleby. And Dh4... Yes! Checkmate! Watch out! Thanks! Hold on, Mrs Anderson. Let's check out my new school. Hello! The two of us are in this together It's what we do The two of us are in this together Hi! High five! J ERRYMAYA'S DETECTIVE AG ENCY JERRYMAYA'S DETECTIVE AGENCY THE FIRST MYSTERY Cook.. - a cockerel. Cook a cockerel-el. Thank you, that's fine. Dear pupils - our long wait is nearly over! For the first time in world history, the Hammarabi Competition will be held at... Valleby School! - My new school, Mrs Anderson! - The Police Commissioner. -. Hello there. In this custom-built security case lies the prize: - The Book of Hammarab/I - The book is here. Bravo! It's here! It is... - Oh goodness! Oh gosh! - Is it okay? Not to worry. It's padded. - It's fine... All is well! - It's padded with... - What's it called...? - Very good. Thank you. And now I hand over to our dear English teacher, Lenny Swanson! - Styrofoam. That's it. - Yes. Styrofoam. That's a dove! - It was a dove. - Right. - No animals allowed in school. - Hide, Mrs Anderson! We're in the process of marking the selection tests. - On Thursday we'll know... - No doves! Which three pupils will be competing for Valleby School! So exciting! You're amazing, Jerry! Let's go. The staff common room, the assembly hall. Silence in there, that's your classroom. A bench to sit on. Toilets are over there. This is your locker. Lemon and... death. Sanitised. Live animals are not permitted in school. I know. - Be sure to stick to our rules of conduct. - Yes. It's not a rule if you don't have to stick to it. No animals. A fly. It's dead now. - Please take her! - But I'm allergic... - Please! - Anything we didn't understand? - Are we clear on the animal ban? - Oh yes. - Live animals aren't permitted. - That's right. Bye. Secretions from the glands of furry animals can cause severe aller... Can I have her back? - Where is she? - Everywhere, it feels like... â€” Sh - _ Stop! E s got my keys! - Mrs Anderson! - The assembly hall! Mrs Anderson! Where are you? Never trust a mouse, no matter how cute... Look! Come on! - It's the Book of Hammarabi. - So cool! No, look... Be careful. It's 4,685 years old. - I don't think you should touch it. - Do you think it's real gold? It'll be worth millions and millions. Don't! Put it back! Someone's coming! You won't make it out. Hide! Balloons! Balloons would be nice. Did you leave the book unguarded? The book will be safe as soon as I've installed the alarm. - What was that? - Eh? - That sound? - I didn't hear anything. The book is gone! Hang on, I'm stuck here. My finger is stuck. The darned lead has wound itself... There. - No... - Yes. A thief in Valleby. I can't believe it. Without the book there's no competition. There'l| be chaos! Uproar! - Not a word about this. - No, no. I can't believe it! Let's see. I have to follow proper protocol with this. Alert. Investigate. What comes next...? Hello? All right, Jerry. You wait here. Mrs Anderson. Who is she? Eh? Jerry... We just want to know what happened. It's... her mouse. It ran into the assembly hall and we ran after it. I see. And the book was in the glass case? Jerry, do you have anything else to tell us? Jerry, just tell us the truth. Was there anyone else there with you? No, just me and Maya. Only you and Maya were in the assembly hall? Look me in the eyes. Is that the truth? - Answer me! - Yes! Only Maya and I were there. She must have taken the book. Good. Let's ask her to come in. Maya... what happened to the book? I've no idea. Maybe it's magic. It was turned into a matchbox. A matchbox! I don't know about your old school, but here at Valleby we tell the truth. - Look in her bag. - Eh? Her bag. Right. - Is it okay if I...? - Sure. No book. Do you think I took the book? We have a witness who saw you, Maya. What? Who? Well, you see, that's confidential. We can't reveal the identity of a witness. The main thing is for you to return the book. Yes. Return the book and all this will be our little secret. I don't get it. What do you mean? Come now, dear. Do you want the entire school to find out that you're a thief? Thief... thief... That's why Queen Elizabeth will be with us during this term. And we have a new class comrade in our class today, so let's practise the word... - Class comrade. - No. Not "class comrade", because it may not even be a real word, but "friend". And "friend" means "mate" or "pa|". And let's all of us help Maya feel really welcome to Valleby. So, the Queen's corgis... HEAD TEACHER MATCHBOX Matches! Cool. I have an idea! Let's make friendship bracelets. Monty was the Queen Mother's corgi, but we'll continue talking about that next week. Good. Mrs Anderson! Where are you, Mrs Anderson? Please come out. I saw you come in here, Mrs Anderson! I can see you. You can? - Are you following me? - No, no. Not at all. I'm looking for the book. That's right. But I can see it's not here, so I'll be going... The head and the commissioner think I've taken the book. Some stupid witness says I did. A lying witness. I always get the blame for everything. It's so rotten! It's not fair! - Mrs Anderson! - My key! Hold this. Careful! Look at this hatch! That sound... I recognise it! - Someone took the book from below. - While we were here. The book thief. We have to tell the police commissioner! Hurry! Oh no! - Oh my... A bomb in the Victorian home! - So sorry. - Have you seen the commissioner? - I think he's in the school office. - I'm so, so sorry. - Not to worry, child. No success without mess. - I'm innocent and I'll prove it. - Right, so you keep saying. The thief was hidden inside, in this cupboard that's... screwed shut. Easy does it, Miss. I swear it was open before! Maya, just return the book and we'll forget all about it. Don't you get it? Your rotten witness is lying! Isn't that so, Jerry? This is important. The Police Commissioner speaking. - Jerry... - The chicken has to be cooked through. Well, I'd say about 7O degrees. Why did you have to run into the assembly hall? We didn't even make it through one day. That's a new record. Now we'll have to find a new school. - Where are you going? - Away from here. - You're not leaving for good, are you? - I so am. They'll all hate me when they hear. Hear what? You're innocent. - The police don't believe me. - I believe you. No one knows the book is missing. If we can find it... - everything will be fine. - Whatever. The thief screwed the case shut while we fetched the commissioner. - So? - It has to be someone at school. Maybe we can solve the case. - You and me? - Yes. - We'd be detectives? - Yes. - You're joking? - No. - Okay. - You're in? - Sure. I'm Maya. - Jerry. Boxes, notebooks, Post-it notes, a stapler, pencil case, pencils, sewing kit, eraser, pencil sharpener, baby powder, compass, magnifying glass, dice, brushes, large pair of tweezers, ruler, a triangular thing, a pair of scissors, a smaller pair, string, alcohol hand wash, lip balm, paperclips, drawing pins, binoculars, tweezers, notebook and false moustaches. - Any questions? - Yes, I have one question. Do you use baby powder on your bottom? No, you use that to get fingerprints... actually. - These are more important. - Handcuffs. What are they for? - Obvious, isn't it? - Not really. Check this out! Ka-pow! Freeze, duck mother! You are so busted! Boom. Okay. Ha ha. Can you take them off now? I'm sure the key was here. There are 103 kids in primary school, 135 in secondary school, 26 teachers, 3 health-care staff and 3 administrators - one part-time. - Maybe it's at home... - Add counsellors and other staff. That's a total of... 276 suspects. - Did you work that out in your head? - Minus you and me. - That's 274 suspects. - You're too much. - Let's look for clues in the hall. - Yeah! Look for shady types, search people's bags, interrogate everyone! Listen... I got a tip-off from someone who saw the thief from this close. - Really? - Maybe this close. Who? I know - it was dark in there, and you were scared, but try to remember. Was it someone in this photo? - Can she even talk? - She can point. - How? - With her nose. - I'm going to the hall. - Mrs Anderson and I are going outside. - Let's go to the assembly hall. - No, this way. There's only one solution... - Rock-paper-scissors. - Precisely. One, two, three! Yes! Come on! The entire school's out here. One of them has to be the thief. - Better get started. - Doing what? - Spread your legs! - What are you looking for? - You're free to go. - We've not stolen anything. - But Maya... - Freeze! - Excuse me...? - That book. It's an encyclopaedia, Maya. They're preparing for the competition. - Did you want something? - No, nothing. Maya, we can't go round accusing everyone of being a thief. Everyone's a suspect until proven otherwise. Look! No, no, no, no, Maya. No! - That's Anna Bola'. She's in sixth grade. - But look at her phone. - How could she afford that? - What? She's sold the Book of Hammarabi and bought a phone. It doesn't work like that, Maya. Just look at them - typical gangsters. Come on! - Got a new phone, have you? - Look at this koala ears filter... - So cute, so cuddly. - I've got to try that. Did you buy that with your own money? Or maybe you sold some loot? - What are you talking about? - I think you know that. - Er... no. - Er... yes. I know a gangster when I see one. No one your age could afford to buy that. - Maybe not, but it was a present. - Sure... It's my birthday today. Right. - Come on, Jerry. - Happy birthday! - Come on! - What was that about? That was so unnecessary. You couldn't sell that book. - Why not? - Everybody would know it was stolen. - It'd be impossible. - So why steal it? No idea. They've locked it to hide the fact that the book is gone. Not a single fingerprint. I know - maybe Mrs Anderson can help. She's got the best nose in all of Valleby. I promise you - look. Look - a feather! - A feather, how is that a clue? - It could be really important. Who was that? Now we'll find what feather it is. - This book has them all. - The thief is a bird? The feather could be from the thief's clothes. The bird could lead us to the thief. - There are only long feathers here. - Yeah... I'll look for the small downy ones. Why is it always me? I thought you knew your stuff, Jerrypedia. Ha ha, very funny. What are they doing? - Hello! You there! Watch the spine! - Whose spine? The spine of the book. Old books are fragile. And this one's mine! You can't just borrow any book you like. Isn't this a library? Yes, yes. It is. YES, IT'S A LIBRARY! SO IN HERE WE SPEAK quietly. If you can't follow the rules, the exit is over there. - Excuse me... - THAT'S THE WAY OUT! - She was so weird. - We need a file or some pliers. Can't we just go to your house and get the key? I've realised that I don't actually have a key. So, what do we do? We go to the bike shop. If you lose your key, they'll cut the lock. - I've done it a thousand times. - I believe you. Look! Let's catch a lift! You're crazy! That's really dangerous. There's the bike shop. We jump off when we slow down. Jerry, come on, jump! No! Oh God... Help... - Come on! - Don't want to. The lorry has stopped. Seriously, Jerry... - Come on! - Last time I go on a bin lorry. Great place! - Weren't we going to the bike shop? - Yes, but you didn't jump off in time. - A boat! - FOR FREE - Come on, we can get in here. - No, Maya. Stop! It says "no admittance". Let's leave, Maya. - I want to know why it's off limits. - Do you really? What a pity, it's locked. Come on, let's go. Not any more. Can't we just look for the book? There's no competition without it. It's my dream to be on the school team. Please Maya... - Jump aboard! - I don't want to. It's too old. - What if it sinks? - Just jump! Okay... Wow! Look! - We can't be here, Maya. - It's fine. - Look, Jerry, you can go inside. - But... No, don't! Calm down. - Wow, this is so cosy! - You call this cosy? How can you call this cosy? A whole day's gone by and our only witness is a rat. - The only clue we have is a feather. - She's a mouse actually. Know what? I'm packing this in and going home to do my homework. Bye. - But look, it's a file! - Really? - Imagine being attached forever. - Like the Hammarabi sisters. Did they ever quarrel? Not so easy to go to your room and slam the door. - No. They were always together. - Never alone. We're no detectives. - Might as well accept it. - At least we tried. Well... I think I'd better go now. Bye-bye! I should just go far away. - Where to? - Far away from Valleby School. They're all going to hate me. What's this? Now I get why you love this cup. Hang on... Where did you find that cup? In the display case. Why? - What was in it? - Coffee, with loads of sugar. So, the thief drinks coffee with a lot of sugar. - Kids don't like coffee. - Grown-ups love it! - It's a clue! - I've an idea. - Free coffee! - Get your coffee here! So, remember: those who take sugar are suspects, the others are off the list. When did you start here? Just the other day. - I'm actually a basketball player. - I see. Ever heard of..."Magic lngmar"? - No. - No. No? Well, a knee injury put a stop to my career and... Then this substitute position opened up, so... - Sugar? - Yes, two, please. Excellent coffee. Truly. Die! Die! Kill, kill, kill! A beetle. Would you like some coffee? - There's a... - Lots of sugar. - Like my sugar first. - Good morning, children. - Do you have any coffee left? - Of course. - Wonderful. - Here you go. Yummy! Like tea and biscuits, sort of. Only better. - Would you like a spoon? - Thank you. Very nice, children. We have 14 suspects. We need to investigate each of them. Gather information, find new clues. 14 people! - There's no time to investigate them all. - We'll do our best. Listen, I have an idea for speeding things up. The police commissioner, how? You know that witness who says I stole the book? - Yes. - I think that's the thief. - Why? - Think about it! That witness blamed me to divert suspicion. - Right. - Talk to the commissioner. Ask him who that witness is. He won't tell me. Hurry! He's going inside. We have to find out what's happened. Now. We can't wait any longer. Don't you see? If Maya doesn't return the book, there won't be a competition. This is serious! - Look at this: lemon cake. - Just bring her in. Who's the witness? It was... top secret. He wouldn't say. We'll never find that book. Dove! Dove! Dove, everybody! Fetch it! Catch that thing! It's done a poo! It's so cute. Jolly good, Maya. Come on... Good girl. Fly away, little dove! Thank you, children. Don't forget next week's homework. You will be tested on the names of all London parks. In alphabetical order. - The feather in the case. - It's the same. A domestic pigeon, descended from the rock dove, Co/umba //v/a in Latin. I thought it might be. The attic! Hurry Jerry! Should we have a grown-up with us? - Seriously, Maya... - What's this? A silly chain won't stop us. There's probably a reason why it's there. We're not allowed. - Now we are! Come on! - This isn't right, Maya. - Look, here's a door. - Yes, but I don't think... It's the attic. Come here, Jerry... Maya, I don't think we're supposed to be here. Look... Doves. The feather came from the thief's clothes. Look, Mrs Anderson. - There's been a fire. - Looks like quite a big fire. Scary place. Look, there's something here. Maybe it's a clue. Two... one... oh... six... seven... - Look Maya! - Eight... Coffee and sugar. The thief was here. - The thief? - The coffee is still hot. What if the thief is here right now... Nice. We've got to see who it is! - Come on, Jerry! - Hurry! Come on! Wait for me! - Look! - The thief's in the staff room! Children! You're not allowed in here. Best friends... Leave immediately! Pardon me. Catch! Four people were in the staff room. One of them is the thief. Suspect Number 1: the caretaker. - The thief screwed the case shut. - He's always got a screwdriver on him. And he's got no issues with stuffed animals. Number 2: the librarian. - She's obsessed with old books. - And the Hammarabi book is really old. I know... Number 3: the English teacher. - Always wears gloves. - There were no fingerprints. Exactly. Really fishy. - And last but certainly not least: - The new PE teacher. Why did he start now? And Magic Ingmar, "I'm actually a basketball player"... - What about the head teacher? - Yes, but... The thief was inside the case while she stood next to it. You can't be in two places at the same time. But there's something fishy about her. I just know it. When the book disappeared there was a matchbox in the case. I saw her take it. She accused me of lying when I told her. - Super fishy. - And when she saw these figures... She nearly fainted. There's something fishy about her. Everyone's a suspect. The competition is only two days away. We just have to find that book! Head teacher Brynolfsson speaking. Hello? Who's this? Didn't you see the matchbox? - What are you talking about? - It's time to tell the truth. Or your competition goes up in smoke. - Best friends forever. - I will never take mine off. Could it be an equation, or a code? Maybe the numbers mean something. You're the smart one - maybe you can figure it out. Maya, are you sure about seeing that matchbox? Absolutely sure. Look what I found - sleeping bags! Let's spend the night here! My parents would never let me. Say you're at a friend's house. - No. They wouldn't buy that. - Why not? I don't have any friends. No one even knows who I am. Everyone will soon know me: "Maya, the book thief." Not much fun. Listen, Maya... - There's something I want to confess. - Me too! You see... I never thought we'd be friends, but I've seen how kind you are. You're a bit odd sometimes, but I like being with you. You're funny, you're smart. You know... I really like you, Jerry. What were you going to say? Me? Well, I... I was going to say exactly the same, actually. So, that's that. You can say you're staying at mine! We're friends now. Goodnight. Do you think the Hammarabi sisters are watching over the book? No. They died a long time ago. What if they're sitting on their star, looking down on us - right now? - Like ghosts... - Come off it! - That dove in the classroom... - What about it? What if they sent it to us because we're the chosen ones? - Don't, you're scaring me. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - What are you doing? - What was that? - It was nothing, Jerry. - No, you're probably right. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Dear kids. Only one day left to go before big the competition starts. Is that going to be fun? - Is that going to be fun? - YES.! That's better. I've marked your tests, and the three pupils who will be competing for our school are: Jonathan in 6A. Sharyn in 6C. And the final member to join the team is... Jerry in 4C! - That's you, Jerry! - Who's Jerry? Here's Jerry! My friend! Jerry! Congrats! That's you, Jerry! You made the team! Go Jerry! You made the school team! I knew you were smart but not thatsmart. Now we really have to find the book so you get to compete. - Do you have the scarf? - Got the scarf. Okay, here's what I'm thinking. We put it out as bait. - So the teacher that picks it up... - Is our thief. Wouldn't mind a cookie right now. Yes, they're coming! - Let's go and look! - It can't be true! - The book is gone! - It's a catastrophe! - To the assembly hall! - They know the book is gone. Oh no! What happens to the competition? Keep calm and carry on. Maya, we need to talk. This is a nasty business. Maya, sometimes when you've done something you regret, you can feel sad. But usually you feel better once you've told a grown-up. - I want you to return the book. - But I don't... Commissioner speaking. Yes, of course. One moment. It's your mother. - Are you there, honey? - Mum...? I told the commissioner it's illegal to interview children like this. It's in violation of article 3, section 4 of the UN Children's Convention. - I'm only trying to help her. - Hardly! You're calling my girl a thief! - What? No, I've not... - Oh yes. I've spoken to her friend. He can vouch for her innocence. Name of Jerry. Jerry? That's the very boy who said Maya was the thief. Jerry is mywitness. Jerry? - Did Jerry say I took the book? - Indeed. Only you and I were there. It was logical to assume it was you. - I should have told you. - Why didn't you? But I... I didn't dare. I'm so sorry. - I thought we were friends. - We are. You can trust a friend, Jerry. Goodbye - forever! - Don't give up! I said I'm sorry. - You rat! Attention! This is the Police Commissioner speaking! The book may be hidden here at school. Everybody must help search for it! If you have any information, leave a message on the information hotline. - I hate that thief! - Me too. Without the book there'|| be no competition. We have to find it! The competition is tomorrow. Mrs Anderson? Mrs Anderson? Mrs Anderson? Mrs Anderson... - Don't! - Let go! No! Stop it! - I'm sorry. - Mrs Anderson's run away again. - Can I help? - She's probably dead already. I've got pastries! - Stop poking about, Mr PE teacher! - We have to call the police! No, we don't! - Police Commissioner! - Yes, it's me. I've been working "undercover" as they say in English. I know, it's a dirty job, but someone has to do it. - Maya, where's the Book of Hammarabi? - That's your bus pass. Oh yes. - Maya, where's the Book of Hammarabi? - I don't have it! - I've told you! - You refuse to cooperate. - Come with me to the station. - I've told you! Anything you say can be used in... lots of different ways. Come along now. Don't you get it? We're also looking for the thief. Just look at all our evidence! I was wrong. Maya is innocent. I'm not a witness. Forgive me, Maya. I see... Oh, right... - The feather's from a dove in the attic. - The thief's hideout. The thief was there at the same time as us. Scary! - We didn't see the thief's face. - So we chased the thief. - The thief ran into the staff room. - Present were: The librarian, the English teacher, the caretaker, and, well... you, of course. - So, where did the thief go? - The thief has to be... either the librarian, the English teacher or the caretaker. Yes! Yes, I see. What an investigation! You've really got a talent for it. - Maybe we could combine our evidence. - Great! So, what have you got? I've got a prime suspect. But that was you, Maya. And then I have... Then I have no clues and no suspects. So, what does that leave me with? The information hotline. People are phoning in. - The champion speaking. - Is this; the hotline? One moment. The book is hidden in the thief's school locker. Hurry up and find it. The competition starts tomorrow! In the thief's locker. Who was that? Never gave her name. And from a secret number. May I... May I take a pastry? Baked in a pie... THE HAMMARABI COMPETITION CANCELLED - Why has it been cancelled? - The book's gone. - Who's in charge here? - The head has gone into hiding. - Crap school. We've prepped for a year! - So have we, you blockhead! - Help! Help! Do something! - I don't know what to do! Hurry! I'm on fire! Help me! Help! Please, help me! The coast is clear. Same here. Get busy, Maya. No book. It's not the caretaker. Okay. What about the librarian? See if the book is in her locker. - Not the librarian. - The English teacher? Nope. Not here. Get the book! Get the book! Hello! What's going on down there? The caretaker will open the thief's locker! Get the book! Get the book! - Get the book! Get the book! - Where are they going? - Here I am. - That's where our lockers are. What's he going to do? Whose locker is it? Move! That's my locker! - Let me through! - Hello? - Open the locker. - No! - Then I'll do it. - No! - Oh yes. - It's my locker! - Hey, wait a bit. - Stand still now. - Can they even do that? - You can't do that. Do something. You're the police! Stop him. That's your job! Ow! What...? Here's an ugly-looking book. The Book of Hammarabi. We've found the Book of Hammarabi! The competition is saved! - Everyone will know you're a thief... - I think you know where the book is. Maya! - Maya... - Where are you going? The competition's starting now. Come on, let's go! Maya? No... Maya! Valleby! Valleby! Valleby! - I don't get how it ended up with Maya. - No. But there we are... - I won't let go of the book for a second. - Good. Thank you. Dear audience, this is a competition. And, naturally, everyone wants to win, but... underneath our differently coloured team t-shirts, our hearts are all the same. So, let us all be friends now. The Hammarabi Sisters Competition has begun! I hate Valleby! I'm getting out of here! And I'm never coming back! We're all familiar with the story of Pinocchio and his growing nose. No doubt you've seen the film, but... what's the name of the author who wrote the book? Start thinking... now! You can hold up your slates now. The correct answer is Carlo Collodi! Jerry! Jerry! - You've got gold paint on your jumper. - Oh... Please open your envelopes. The question is: which are the countries? Start thinking... now! Kenya, or France maybe? Kenya, I think. That can't be France. - I have to go to the loo. - Not now! I think it's Kenya. What do you think? Answers, please! What's this now? Hello? Hello? Could someone give us a bit of light? What's going on? - The book's still here. - There we are - cosy! We have a little light back. Great. Apologies for that little mishap. Let's turn this way for the answer of the Valleby team. Where's Jerry? - Where's Jerry? - Where is he? Come on! Just start, stupid boat! Mummy! What are you doing, boy? - That's dangerous! - I know! Look, he's on the bin lorry! Hey lad, isn't this where you usually get off? Oh yes, it is. Thank you. Good luck! Amici. Oh no'.! Maya! Stop! Maya, I'll save you! Wait! Maya! Maya! I'm coming to save you! Jerry, what are you doing? - What? Save me! - Hang on... What's going on? - Here you go. - Thanks. I thought you had cast off. Where would I go? - Why aren't you in the competition? - Some things are more important. - Waterproof? - It's 2018. Everything is waterproof. New evidence. Did you get gold on your hands when you touched the book? - No. It's several thousand years old. - Right. Look here... Gold on her fingers. And I got gold on my jumper when she touched me. She made a fake copy of the book and hid it in your locker. She's the only one with a master key. Right. But why would she want to frame you? She must think I look like a thief. She's hiding something. I just know it. Jerry, it's over. Okay? What do you mean? You can't give up! We're this close to solving the case! Sorry, mate, but I'm never going back there. It's over. "Maya... ' Yes? Thanks for everything. - Hang on... Maybe it's a date! - What? - The numbers. - What numbers? The O and 6 are the month, the 2 and 1 for the 21st. The 7 and 8 is 1978. The 21st of June 1978. Maybe something happened on that day. - No, it's just a stupid idea. - On the contrary. You're a genius! That's the day of the great fire at Valleby School! The school nearly burnt down. Nice one, Maya! Come on! "21 June 1978. Big fire at Valleby School." "The Hammarabi Competition cancelled." The Hammarabi Competition? It's not the first time the book is in Valleby. "The fire began in the school's attic. A child had been playing with matches." "A poor little girl was rescued from the flames. The brave girl"... Was it him? "Identified the pyromaniac. The boy will be sent to a strict boarding school." - I ha ven '2' done anything! - The girl's name... "Margareta Brynolfsson." Hang on... That's the head teacher! She was a pupil at Valleby School. What if the thief is the boy who was sent away? The theft might be his revenge! The matchbox! It was a message to the head! "The young pyromaniac suffered severe burns to his hands." Here's the boy's name. "Lennart Svensson." - Hang on... Now I get it! - Now I get it! Now all the lies will burn! Return the book! I The Head Teacher The thief fell for it and thinks we're the head teacher. "If you tell the truth about the fire." "Last chance. Tell everyone in the hall, or the book goes up in flames." He'll burn the Book of Hammarabi! The suspense is killing me. Wait! What is it? What if they won't believe us and think I'm the thief? Enough of that now. Okay? We're in this together. Okay- exactly the same score: Solbacka and Valleby schools. - Can you see him? - No, it's too dark. Mice! And here is the final question. - And the subject is languages. - The lead. The lead! What's the Latin word for "friends"? - The thief! - Maya is here! - Ow! Let me go! ' Stop her! Let Jerry go! Maya, come down. That's dangerous! - I'm innocent! - Everyone says that. Do something! Nod.! - She'll take the book! - But look, it's fake! It's painted gold! It's not the Book of Hammarabi! It's a forgery! - That's my home economics book! - One moment. You painted it gold, and then you put it in Maya's locker. Admit it! Well, I never... - I didn't steal the book. - No, but you know who did. Lennart Svensson. He was also a pupil at Valleby School. And he's here, in the assembly hall. That's Lenny. He didn't attend Valleby. He's from England. - Don't you recognise me, Maggan? - No. Oh, sorry... Now? Lennart? Is that you? - It most certainly is. - Lelle, did you steal the book? It so happens I did. The children are right. I'm the book thief. We were best friends, Maggan. Do you remember? Remember that day when we snuck into the attic? The day before the Hammarabi Competition. I'd got us one of those friendship bracelets. "Best friends forever." Do you remember? I just wanted to help you fasten it, but... there was a fire. I tried to put it out... with my bare hands. But I couldn't. We were both at fault, Maggan. Weren't we? But I got all the blame. "Lennart", they said. "Lennart ruined the Hammarabi Competition." I was sent off to England. All alone. Went to school there. Had to eat plum pudding. Shepherd's pie. I hate shepherd's pie! While you, you stayed on like some kind of hero. Is this true? Is this man telling the truth? Yes, it's true. What a terrible friend you were! And you made me think Maya was the thief! All in order to hide the truth. What a horrid thing to do! I didn't mean to put the blame on him, but the grown-ups put pressure on me. - I was only a child. - You betrayed me. - I was your friend. - You're no better! Pretending to be someone else and letting a kid carry the can for your crime! - Shame on you! - All the cards are on the table now. But the most important question is: Where's the book? - It's where it all began. - The fire alarm! Disaster! Don't panic! Don't panic, but disaster is upon us! There's Mrs Andersson! - The Book of Hammarabi. - Did you put out the fire? You've spilt coffee all over the table. You're soaking wet. She must have smelt the coffee, tipped over the cup and saved the book. You're right. Best nose in all of Valleby. There, there. Don't panic. - All clear! - The Book of Hammarabi is safe! The book is safe! You've done a fantastic job, kids! Couldn't have done it better myself. Can I give you a call if I come across any more mischief? - Absolutely. We're right here. - We'll teach you everything we know. By the way, you're still wearing an earring. Oh no... Thanks. Well done, Maya. Really. You could have won the competition but chose to help your friend. Respect. - But who won? - The final question is the decider. Okay, everybody! What's the Latin word for "friends"? Valleby School has an answer! "Friends" in Latin is... - mam/cl. - Exactly right! We won! We won! Now you'll have to take responsibility for the book. Keep it in a safe place. In a safe place... - What do you say, is it time to go? - Yeah, sure. Where is she going? - Where are you going? - To a safe place. Oh no, Mrs Andersson has run away again. I don't believe it! - What's our most important rule here? - Live animals aren't permitted. With one exception. - Mrs Andersson! - Mrs Andersson... - She's cute. She's welcome here. - Thanks! Bye-bye. What do you say, are we done here? - Coming? - Yeah. There, that's the last time you run away. Know what, Maya? It's a good thing that you're a bit crazy... Or she wouldn't have run into the hall, and we'd never have become friends. And I'm glad you're a wimp who doesn't dare jump from running lorries. Or we wouldn't have found our secret office. - Our detective agency. - MayaJerry's Detective Agency. No. JerryMaya's sounds much better. What? No... Yes, and J comes before M in the alphabet. - I'll beat you to the ice-cream van! - No, you won't! JerryMaya's Detective Agency "The First Mystery" - I'm running as fast as I can. - Don't you want ice-cream? Two very special friends lived in Valleby. Although they were quite different, they shared a certain talent: They were experts at solving mysteries. This could have been the end, but the story of JerryMaya's Detective Agency has only just begun.
