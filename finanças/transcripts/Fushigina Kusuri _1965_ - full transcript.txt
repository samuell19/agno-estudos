Fushigi na Kusuri (1965) (The Mysterious Medicine) Director: Tadanari Okamoto Writers: Shin'ichi Hoshi (story) Haruo Mura (screenplay) There it is, Boss. Lower it, please. Good,good. Then, take that for me. Well then... Who is it? Doron. I promised to stop by. Professor, he’s arrived earlier than promised. Very well. We'll have him wait. Yes, sir. Please wait here. Ah, thank you. It's finished! Ah, it smells like lilies. It also tastes good. Try it. Professor, it tastes mysterious. Huh? My shoulders feel so relieved! I have created many medicines before now... But there is no medicine that can compare to this. Huh! He did it! Hmm...this must be the fantastic medicine I'd heard rumors about... help one perform mathematical calculations at 300 times normal speed. Or, perhaps, a medicine that will help one see in the dark... Or, perhaps, a medicine that will make one's body light as a mouse... ...able to climb up walls and even upside-down on the ceiling. And it may even be a medicine that allows one to disappear like a gas. Well.._.in«any case, I will claim the medicine. It will be mine. Hey, hey, let me drink some. Come on! You can't have it. It's like poison to you. You're lying! It’s probably just a cocktail, right? Or maybe it's juice? Hey... Boy, please send my guest in. Yes, sir. Sorry to keep you waiting. Please step this way. Thank you. What brings you here? I heard you had just invented a fantastic medicine. I would like to see it. Oh, I see. News travels fast. You are the talk of the scientific community. I would love to test your product firsthand. But I won't be able to release it to the public for quite a while. Now, don't hold back. For the sake of humanity, we must release it as quickly as possible. Well, I still have some tests to run. Ah, can you speed those up at all? Well, no... What a pity. . Oh, is this your lab equipment? The exit is that way. I will visit you again soon. There's a radar system. If we're going to sneak in, we need to outsmart the radar somehow. Ahh, that looks a bit difficult. That's it! I'll use the electro-deflector that I stole the other day. Goodidea! Now things have gotten interesting. Hmm, this is the place. Now, do it. Boss, hurry! Good. Now, let's go. Help me! X Hmm, okay. What are you gentlemen doing? You think using something dinky like that will let you get in? This lab isn't like any other! And those clothes. What an overdone look. You two are behind the times. Just cut that out. Dammit, what're ya saying? Quiet. Can you tell us how to get in? We will repay you as you wish. Oooh, now he's brought out the big guns. Very well, I'll tell you. On those buttons, push 3821754690... Turn the dial twice right... Once left, once right, and go! That's it. It's that blue stuff that I want. You can't have this one. You deserved that. Hey, hey! Unfair! Wait up! Little brat. We won't let you off so easily this time! Hey, Tonki...first have the kid operate the machine to get me down. Ah...l recognize that voice...you're Doron, aren't you! Correct. I am Doron. Thanks. You helped me out a lot. Ouch! Ouch! Boss, wait up! Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me, please! Well then, now that we have this medicine... Gold and diamonds are like nothing! We have the treasure of all treasures in our possession! Come, Tonki. We will drink this medicine and... Our bodies will become so light we can fly in the sky. And our eyes will pierce more sharply than radar. And our brains will be able to decode faster than a calculator! And even if we are caught and our bodies are chained up... The enemy will not be able to detect or locate us! Our scheme is a big success. Our reward will be mountains of money! That's the plan. Banzaﬂ Good. Now let's first test this medicine. Tonki, you drink it first. No, no, Boss, you can go first. Don't be scared. But I don't like medicine. Don't complain, just drink! Must I? It tastes nice. I like it. My head feels all clear. Then I'll drink it next. This feels really good! - Damn you! Hey, what're you doing? Tonki, wait up! Wait up! Tonki, come back! Come back! Damn it, that Tonki. Has he gone insane? Great invention, my foot! What a fraud of a scientist! It hurts! P-Please help me! It hurts so much! Professor, will he be okay? Now, don't worry. Hey, you...did you really drink the medicine? Yes, I did! And then I didn't realize I was doing crazy things until just now. 5-50, I wanted to return the medicine I stole. It hurts! Please forgive me! There, there...you'll feel better right away. You see, this medicine was invented to turn an evil and twisted heart into a good heart. That's the reason you came here to return the medicine. Seriously? Of course. Thanks to you, I have now seen the full results of this medicine. That is because there were no bad people who would volunteer to test such a medicine. I really didn't know how to test it and was in a real fix. But thanks to you, I'm saved! Well? You wanna drink it? Ridiculous! I don't need that kind of medicine! I figured that's what everyone would say. It's more difficult to force people to take this medicine than it is to make the medicine. I see. Oh, no! Now I wish I'd had the Boss drink some after all.
