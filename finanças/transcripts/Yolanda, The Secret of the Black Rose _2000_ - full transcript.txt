(laughing) What a hard game it is being a pirate! Fights, boarding ships, and the never-ending search for treasure. Treasure and adventure! (laughs menacingly) - This place is a proper mess! (speaking in a foreign language) What a pig-sty! (speaking in foreign language) - That's my shipmate, Polyglot. Who, apart from being fluent in many languages, is a general nuisance. (laughs menacingly) (shrieking) Well, lad! (laughing) - El Capitan Skully's back! (speaking in foreign language) Help! (shrieking) (coins jingling) - We'll forget that multilingual menace for the time being. Ahoy, valiant corsairs! It is a great honor to introduce myself. My name is Captain Skull, and I am the spirit of pirates. Well, some people call me the Jolly Roger. (laughs) (hat twirling) Ha! (hat twirling) (grunting) Ah-ha! I'm always forgetting my left arm. We're short of bones now that you people get buried properly. There's something I want to show you. First, I'll retrieve my hat. From forgotten times, when folk longed for justice and true heroes. This isn't it. (Polyglot shrieking) (treasure clattering) Where is it? Ah, here it is! Just what I was looking for. The most beautiful, mysterious, magical black rose. (Polyglot speaking in foreign language) What the? (grunts) Get off it! Let me have it! (Polyglot screaming) Get off, me bony bird. Now, in 1764... - Begins a story of wealth and greed and... - [Captain Skull] Pirates! The Black Rose is the symbol of the bravest corsair to ever sail the seas. The Black Corsair. And he was the only man able to free the people of Maracaibo from the oppression of their cowardly and cruel Governor Van Gould. Who had killed the Black Corsair's brothers, the Red Corsair and the Green Corsair. Young Karmo, more pirate's soul and passionate cook, and Marco, a young lad strong as a bull, were the Black Corsair's faithful apprentices. And they never forgot the promise that he made. - I swear to avenge the death of my brothers, and I will free Maracaibo from Governor Van Gould. In the name of the Black Rose. For my brothers. (rose ignigting) - [Pirates] For the corsairs of the Black Rose! (triumphant music) (fire crackling) (choir vocalizing) - The Black Corsair had lost his brothers but not his hope. (cannons blasting) And the Black Corsair himself? He was known to have died on the battlefield. Years passed, and now the hopes of all oppressed people rely entirely on the Black Corsair's faithful friends. The Black Corsair had buried a treasure large enough to raise an army that would defeat Van Gould. - Ooh, ah! Now, I'm first. (gun firing) - But where the infamous treasure is hidden is a closely guarded secret. (Polyglot laughing) But there is only one person in the world able to lead them to the treasure, and she doesn't know about it, not yet. That person is the one who has the Black Stone, one of the keys to the treasure. But who is it? (upbeat music) (Yolanda grunting) - [Asuero] Well done, Yolanda, it was a good fight. - [Yolanda] I hate to say this, but I'm not finished yet. - [Asuero] Good, now, show me what you got! (Asuero groaning) (swords clanging) (Asuero speaking in foreign language) (Yolanda groaning) (Asuero grunting) - [Yolanda] Make your move! - [Asuero] I'm not sure you're ready for these, Yolanda. Ahh! (both grunting and groaning) - [Yolanda] Ahh! (swords clanging) (Yolanda groaning) - [Both] Ahh! (Asuero groans) - [Yolanda] Ahh! (Yolanda grunts) (sword clanging) Touche! - [Asuero] I yield. (Emilio laughing gleefully) - [Yolanda] Emilio! - [Asuero] Congratulations, Yolanda. - Yes, I did it! The Black Rose attack. I just can't believe it! Thank you, Emilio, and yes, I'm proud of you too. - [Captain Skull] Beware, beautiful Yolanda wears the Black Stone but she does not know what that means. Not yet. - Yolanda, my dear... - What is it, Asuero? - I must tell you I knew your father. I knew him very well, in fact. Ad before he died, he asked me... - You say you knew my father! Who was he, Asuero? You must tell me! - He taught me the Black Rose attack. - My father, a swordsman like you? - Well, yes, but actually, he was the best swordsman I have ever seen. Yolanda, your father was the famous Black Corsair. - The Black Corsair, that fearsome pirate? I can't believe it! - He gave me these letters to give to you, and I think the time is now right for you to read it. - It can't be true. Why did no one ever tell me before, Asuero? - Your aunt was afraid it would give you ideas. - Ideas? What ideas? The Black Corsair, the devil of the seven seas. No, I just can't believe it. - Your father, the Black Corsair, was a great man. And if you knew him, you would be as proud of him as I am. In fact, he was the most admirable person I ever met. Every day, I wish he was still alive. - Do you know precisely what you are saying? - On my oath, I do. I shall leave you alone so you can read your letter. - [Black Corsair] My dearest Yolanda, this is my way of speaking to you as one adult to another. (Emilio whining) (music crescendos) - Black Corsair! - Yes, Yolanda. - So it is true that you're my father! - Yes, my darling, and now you are not a child anymore. You will understand. On the other side of the ocean, there's a wild and beautiful place called Maracaibo. Where a cruel tyrant, Governor Van Gould, torments the people. Condemning them to poverty... - Oh, no, please! - [Black Corsair] And slavery. They need you, Yolanda. You are the only one able to free them. But you need three things to find the treasure. (Emilio whining) (mystical tinkling) - But what, Father? I don't understand, what are those things? - You already have the Black Stone. Now, you must find the Green Map and the Red Scepter. With these three keys, you will find the richest treasure in the world. I left it for you. - Yes, but wait, wait! - [Black Corsair] You must find that treasure to save the people of Maracaibo. - Corsair blood runs through my veins! I'm a corsair with a mission! - Yolanda, who told you all this? - [Yolanda] I will fight for freedom and for justice! I am a pirate now! - But my dear, a pirate? The poor girl, what is she talking about? - You are a lady, Yolanda, and ladies do not talk of becoming pirates or vagabonds! - My father gave me a mission, and nobody will stop me! Yeah! - [Man] But you were to be my bride, Yolanda! - Oh, Yolanda! - Yolanda! - Oh, what a disgrace! (all groaning) (bodies tumbling) - We need a change of air, Emilio. I say we go to the Caribbean. - [Captain Skull] So Yolanda and Emilio stowed away on one of Van Gould's ships headed for Maracaibo. (tense music) - Good work, pull it up. (sailor grunting) This dolphin should provide us with a plentiful supply of fresh food. (dolphin squealing) (slicing) You idiot, you let it escape! - [Sailor] I did not! (dolphin squealing gleefully) - Yeah, we did it, Emilio! The dolphin is free! (dolphin laughing) (Emilio laughing) Emilio and I are glad to have helped. We'll call him Star. Goodbye! - [Captain Skull] Once in Maracaibo, Yolanda wastes no time looking for allies in her battle against evil Governor Van Gould. (atmospheric music) Unknown to her, Van Gould already knows of her presence in Maracaibo. And is determined to get the Black Stone, no matter what the price. (people chattering and laughing) (fighters grunting) (man laughing) - [Yolanda] This looks like a good place to start looking for my father's old comrades, the corsairs of Turtle Island. (people chattering) Huh? (people chattering) - Oh, no! - You men follow me! (patrons yelling) Silence! (people yelling and laughing) Silence, I said! (gun fires) (wine splashing) (patrons gasping) - Now now, no need to get mad, mister. Oh, I need a drink. (man slurping) - [Man] Let me at it! (groaning) - What's the big idea, what's going on? - By order of our esteemed Governor Van Gould, we are searching for a pretty girl. (patrons laughing) - And who isn't? (patrons laughing) - There is a reward for her capture. - What's the little lovely look like? - (shushing) Stay hidden, Emilio. - [General] She's a tall beauty of noble breeding with long golden hair. - Oh, no! - There's only a bunch of smelly old sea dogs in here. Ooh! (pincher laughing) Tell your governor to stop wasting his money on wenches! Poor of Maracaibo need it more. - She's right! - No wenches here, mister! - All right, let's go. - [Man] Ignore the lads, let 'em search. - Phew! - Well, look what we have here! You, lad, come and join me and me crew in a brew, why don't ye? - You'd best sit, lad, before the stench of John Bad Breath Largo knocks you dead. - I'm always looking for a sturdy lad to sail with me under the Jolly Roger! - Tell us your name, lad. Don't be shy. (dramatic music) (Largo groans) (Yolanda Yells) (pirate yells) (sword swishes) (Yolanda grunts) (both groaning) (sword swishing) (Yolanda yells) (boot stomping) (patrons cheering) (patrons gasping) (Yolanda yelling) - [Patron] Come on guys! - [Crowd] Get him! (Crowd Yelling) (Chandelier Jangling) (Yolanda yelling) (boots stomping) (dishes clattering) (patrons cheering) (Largo groans) (Yolanda grunts) (patrons cheering) - Come back here, lad! (peg leg whirring) (peg leg banging) (Yolanda screaming) (laughing) More than one use for a peg leg! - Yeah! - We got him! - [Pirates] The fugitive, sir! - The reward's mine! - So buy some mint to freshen your breath, why don't you? (exhaling dramatically) Your breath stinks of cheap rum, you pig! - [Captain Valera] Your Excellency, it's Captain Valera. I must see you at once. (knocking on door) - Go away, I'm working! - Yes, but I have captured the girl, Excellency. - What? (woman squeals) Well, come in. Come on in, Captain. (woman groaning) - [Captain Valera] I have brought you that thieving pirate brat. - I'm Yolanda, and I'm daughter of the Black Corsair. - Little Yolanda, the child of my dead niece, Anarata. Your poor mother made a fatal mistake when she fell in love with the Black Corsair, my girl. - I know your tyranny and betrayals, Van Gould, and how you murdered my father and uncles! - I merely disposed of troublesome pirates. Anyone who gets in my way will meet the same fate. (cats meowing aggressively) (Emilio squealing) (cats meowing) (Emilio squealing) I am not a man to be double-crossed, Yolanda. (Emilio squealing) Have patience, my pets. I promise you can have her rat later. When I finish with her. (Emilio squealing) First, I must collect my prize, the Black Stone! - I'm afraid the girl does not have the stone, Governor. - What, where is it? Where's my Black Stone? - You mean my father's Black Stone? - [Van Gould] Tell me where it is or I'll have you put in the rack and stretched 'til you scream for mercy! - Let me show her some pirate torture, like this! (exhaling) (Yolanda groaning) I'll lash her to the anchor and dunk her 'til she's half drowned. She'll tell you where it is then! - Believe me, your breath is torture enough. But no matter what, I'll never tell you where the stone is, even if I knew. - (groaning) Lock her away! (dishes smashing) (woman groaning) I need some time to think. - [Valera] I'll be back later for me farewell. - Oh, yes, the reward. We'll see to that, Largo. - Very well. She must have given the Black Stone to one of the other corsairs. So why not announce her public execution, and we'll lure them all into a trap? - Shut up, I need to think. I have it, cover the city with posters and have the town criers announce this, the imminent execution of the daughter of the Black Corsair. - Good idea, now, why didn't I think of that? (Yolanda groaning) - So, it looks like Van Gould is gonna execute me. I don't know how things could get any worse. (Emilio squealing) (dramatic music) (Emilio screams) There seems to be no way out of here. This is no time to play, Emilio. Father would be disappointed in me. - [Black Corsair] Never, my daughter. - Father, father! Is it really you? - Don't give up, Yolanda. Van Gould is evil and must be stopped. You have the power Yolanda. The blood of the corsair flows through you. Remember, you have the key to your freedom. (Yolanda yells) Have courage daughter. No matter how bad it seems, I will always be with you. - I know and I will not fail you father. We have the key or we will soon. (footsteps echoing) (guard snoring) The key, Emilio. Bring me the key. (Emilio yelps) (Emilio squealing) Quickly, Emilio! Will you hurry up? (guard snores) (guard groans) (rope snapping) That's it! You've got it! (Emilio squealing) (rat soldiers growling) (Emilio squealing) (armor clashing) Hurry, Emilio! (key clanging) (Emilio grunting) (rat soldiers growling) (Emilio screaming) (rat soldiers yelling) This will teach you to mess with my hamster. (Emilio squealing) (Yolanda chuckling) - There's the fugitive! (soldiers yelling) - These walls can't hold me. - [Soldier] Get her! Get her! (Yolanda yells) (horse neighs) (soldiers grunting) Stop! (soldiers moaning) - There she is! (sword clanging) - Ahh! (Yolanda yells) (crowd cheering) (soldier yelling) (swords clanging) Thank you! (fighters grunting) (swords clanging) (Yolanda grunting) (swords clanging) Ahh! - She's just a girl, take her! (Valera Groaning) - I'll show you just what a girl can do. (swords clanging) (fighters grunting) (swords clanging) You'll never take me. (sword snapping) - I've got lots of tricks up my sleeve. As you can see. - I have a few of my own. - Alright, we've got you now. (Yolanda grunting) - [Captain Valera] Finish her! - With great pleasure. (smacking) (Largo groaning) - I am a solider and I will not stand by while a pirate shoots a maiden in the back. - [Captain Valera] Surrender or die, Yolanda. - [Man] Hold on... - Huh? - We're coming! - [Captain Valera] Stop them! (soldiers yelling) (Yolanda grunting) (man yelling) (fighters groaning) - I'm more than sworn allies with the daughter of the Black Corsair. - My name is Yolanda and I am the daughter of the Black Corsair. - (yelling) Somebody help me, please please! - (laughing) Pleased to meet you daughter of the Black Corsair. (Marco yelling) The big guy there is Marco. (Marco grunting) (ax and swords clashing) - I served your father and it's an honor to serve you, Yolanda. - The honor is mine, Marco, and I'm sure glad you're on our side. (soldier grunts) - The pirates are escaping Captain Valera. (Polyglot squawking) (snoring) - Wake up! The audience wants to know what's going on. - Tell them to... - [Polyglot] Yes? - Come back later. (Polyglot groans) - Alright, you asked for it. (metal clanging) (Captain Skull groaning) - What? Well, alright. (yawning) That's better. I always like to keep an eye open for trouble. (Captain Skull laughing) Yolanda and her friends may have escaped for the time being, but Van Gould will stop at nothing. - [Yolanda] Lunch time is over, Karmo. (Emilio squealing) He's saying the Bullion's on our tail and they're closing fast. - Carlitos, trip the stays and douse the (mumbles). - [Yolanda] Uh, stay trim and (mumbles). (Emilio squeals) - Aye-aye, Captain Karmo, sir. - You better go and help Carlitos, Emilio. - Let's sail with the wind Marco, the rain will outrun them. - I'm tired of running away. I say we turn around and fight. Let's keep our honor. - Only a fool fights when running's a better choice. You've no right to risk our lives or the freedom of our people. - What I mean is... (meat tears) - I say why don't we discuss it over lunch. - [Carlitos] Cannonball! Heading this way! (water splashes) - My snack has been ruined. This is war! No you'll see how a hungry pirate fights! So you want my food? Well, then... Here we are! (fuse sizzles) You can have it! - Keep firing, Captain Valera! (cane bangs) We shall rip through her sails and bring down her masts and leave her helpless. (watermelon smashes) (pirates moan) They're making a laughing stock out of us! I want them blown to pieces. - [Valera] Aye, sir! You heard the governor! (canons firing and exploding) - We're no match for their fire power! Look out! (cannonball firing) (mast smashing) (crowd screams) - Hmmm. You're right Marco. There's only one thing to do. (group gasps) - Surrender? I'm no coward. I'd rather die with honor. - Yes, Morgan I know that. But Van Gould knows nothing but cowardice, right? - Huh? - [Yolanda] Let's hope he falls for it. - Oh yeah! - [Valera] Look, they're giving up, your excellency. - The moment I've been waiting for. Yolanda will not escape me now. And those corsairs will be hanged! And the black stone will be mine! (laughs menacingly) Board her! (hooks swishing) (hooks clanging) (soldiers yelling) (soldiers laughing and cheering) - I just hope this works! - Corsairs of Turtle Island... Now! (sailors yelling) (group lauging) - [All] We are the corsairs of Turtle Island! - They tricked us! Get them. And don't come back without the Black Stone! And the head of the daughter of the Black Corsair! Do you hear me? - Yes, excellency. - I apologize for my rude entrance. My name is Albert. I am a soldier serving in Mont Lima's army. - I'll let my sword introduce me. (fighters grunting) (swords clanging) - Our swords will always fight together, Morgan. - Well well, daughter of the Black Corsair. Mind if I cut in? (hook clangs) (Yolanda yells) (Valera laughs) I'll present you to Governor Van Gould on a skewer. - You'll never get the chance. (Marco grunts) (soldier yells) - We'll see, shall we? (Yolanda grunts) Huh? (Yolanda grunts) (Valera yells) - Allow me to help you. (Valera yells) (water splashing) And try not to lose this again. (fighters grunting) (swords clanging) - You use a sword well. (Morgan grunting) And you are my equal! (soldier laughing) Hey! Look out behind you! - Now you don't think I'd fall for that old trick? (Albert yelling) (smacking) (teeth clattering) - Oww! - I cannot stand by and watch a man stabbed in the back. (fighters grunting) (swords clanging) - You are gentleman sir. And you're fighting on the wrong side. - A soldier obeys those whom he serves! (fighters grunting) (sword clanging) - A man should only fight for what he believes in! (fighters grunting) And if it's justice is what you believe in, then why not join us? - Who knows what fate holds for me? (crashing) (Morgan grunting) Or for you if you live! - I intend to live, alright! We'll meet again another time, my friend. (cannonball firing) - Get your head down, Emilio! (fuse sizzling) (cannonball firing) (mast smashing) - Got them! Huh? - Look out! Here we come! - (groaning) What is it? - My name is Carlitos! And I serve the daughter of the Black Corsair. - Here's something to remember me by! Whenever you ask "why?" You'll know "Y" is for Yolanda! - [Van Gould] You little raggamuffin! - The black stone together with the red scepter and the green map are, as you know, the key to finding the hidden treasure. You must succeed. - But father, how can I succeed where you could not? - The cause is greater than you, my daughter. And you will rise to it. (mystical whirring) (swords clanging) Your uncles and I swore a pledge. We are the three corsairs and we fight as one. For freedom for all and tyranny for none. Remember those words, my daughter. - Yes father, I will. I promise I will. (Emilio squealing) - Now, firstly you must find Tuktakapen. - Tuktakapen? Wait, I don't understand. Father? What does it mean? - Tuktakapen is one of the islands far to the north. What is such an island to you? - That island will be the starting point for our search. Set sail for the north. - The north? At this time of year? We'd be sailing right into the Koweta. The most feared storm of the seven seas. (dramatic music) - Uh, what is the Koweta? - The legend has it that pirate ships that tried to sail through the terrible Koweta were attracted to a mysterious wave that swallowed them whole like a whale swallows a sardine. No one knows what attracted them to their doom. - Stop it Karmo. Can't you see you're scaring the boy? - He's not scaring me. Tell me more. - Well, all the sailors that went down to Davey Jone's locker can be heard at night. Their terrible cries and dreadful moans wailing over the water. (upbeat music) - [Captain Skull] So they sailed north for days, but were still no closer to land. - Here all of you, wear these. - You're supposed to eat garlic, not wear it. - Not this time. This is to drive away evil spirits if they should try to invade our souls. - (laughing) Oh, that spell would drive anyone away. Look, there's no such thing as ghosts. - If that's true, then what's that? (dramatic music intensifying) (Emilio squealing) I'm cold and scared. (Marco screaming) - We're hopelessly lost. We'll never find our way out. - The fog is flowing into us. I just don't know what to do. Oh, I feel so confused. - (moaning) We must turn back now or we'll be haunted by the fog forever. We must turn back! - Shut up, you superstitious old fool! - So a sprat still green around the gills dares to call me a fool? (fighters grunting) (swords clashing) - You must be an old fool to threaten me, grandpa! - Karmo, Morgan! What's happening? What's this madness? Father please, give us strength. - Remember, freedom for all, tyranny for none. Remember those words, Yolanda. Believe in yourself and your sword. - Yes, father. I'm a corsair! This is my sword and my soul is free! (sword zapping) (Morgan yelling) (swords clashing) - You've breathed your last, old man! You're last! - Morgan, stop! (swords clanging) (Morgan gasps) Why are you fighting? You have to stop. You have a greater goal. We're corsairs, and our swords should only fight for freedom. Freedom for all, and tyranny for none. - [Karmo And Morgan] Tyranny for none! (swords zapping) (fog screaming) - [Marco] What was it? What happened to it? - The evil spirit. Something even my garlic couldn't handle. (Karmo chomping) (Karmo spitting) - Huh? Look over there! (ominous music) - [Karmo] It looks deserted. - [Marco] You mean haunted. - [Karmo] Either way, I don't like the look of it. And it's heading our way! - Whoever's aboard may know a way out of this fog. Marco, you and Carlitos stay with the ship. The rest of us are going to investigate. - Welcome aboard mates. It's good to see another living soul again. It's too bad you won't be living long! (maniacal laughing) (Emilio screams) - It's a trap! - That is it, missy! Go get 'em! (skeletons yelling) - There's why you see I always said that dieting never did anybody any good. - Here they come! (rum guzzling) - Let' drink to that! (fire blazing) (Emilio squealing) (swords clashing) - This guy thinks he's the original Jolly Roger. Bye bye, Roger! - You're fighting them one at at time? Come on, you men! We don't want to be here all day, now do we? - Okay Morgan, if it's competition you're after, let's play. You got three, huh? (sword swishing) (skeletons yelling) All six at once. That makes it seven to three. Beat that, Morgan. (skeleton cat growls) (Emilio blows raspberry) (wood slams) (skeleton cat crashing) (Emilio giggling) - I must warn Marco to turn back. - [Marco] It's no good, I can't control her. (lighting crashes) Hold on! (wave splashes) (lighting crashes) (lighting crashes) (mast snapping) - Oh no! - Yolanda! We just can't leave her behind! We're going in after her, come on! - (laughing) It's too late you careless ape! The Kaweta is hungry for your soul! - Its no good Emilio. I don't think I can hold on much longer (Emilio squealing) (waves lapping) It's too late! I can't hold on! - It looks like you could do with a little help here. - Morgan what happened. Where's Karmo? - [Karmo] Look it's the Kaweta itself. The sea rocket. The soul of the storm. - [Marco] Come on Karmo, we've got to latch to the masts and pray. - Well this is it, we could be going to Davey Jone's locker. I'll miss you two. And I'm going to miss dinner! - So the Kaweta is a sea demon! It feeds on the spirits it traps and grows stronger with every brave that it steals. - The Black Corsair was the bravest soul to sail the seven seas. And you have his blood in you Yolanda. He's part of you. - That's it Morgan. The black stone has the spirit of my father inside. It's the key freedom for our people! - You're in this deep, become part of the Kaweta! - I'm a corsair! Freedom for all, tyranny for none! - You must... (Kaweta choking) (Kaweta moaning) (Kaweta exploding) - The spirits are free. The Kaweta's gone! (Emilio crying) But we still have no idea where our friends are! We must get the green map back from Governor Van Gould. - That's not going to be easy, Yolanda. - We must free our people once and for all. There's not time to lose! Come on, I'll race ya! - I'm right behind you! (Emilio squealing) - [Captain Skull] Before sailing for Tuktakapen, our friends followed Van Gould to the island of St. Thomas. Where their search for the green map leads them to a masked ball. (clanging) (Emilio squealing) - [Morgan] What a lovely little place, charming. (orchestral music) - Good evening gentlemen, whom shall I announce? - Announce us? Yes, of course you must announce us. - May I say, if Governor Van Gould knew that were were here, he'd order us to be brought straight before him. I can assure you of that, my good man. - Yes madam, but I'm sure you can see that I must announce you. - Surely you know we're the Romanoffs. - [Doorman] But of course. If only I had known. A thousand pardons. - And your shoelace is untied. (doorman groans) - Good, we're in. - Yeah! - Come on. We better split up. Carlitos and I will start mingling with the guest. - I'll check out the kitchen and the pantry, and I vow not to leave any dish untested. - Marco and I will take the upstairs. - [Yolanda] This is it corsairs, so good luck. - [All] We're the corsairs of the coast! - Remember, we're looking for the green map. Let's split up. - Right, Morgan. (Emilio squeals) (door creaking) (Emilio squealing) (Emilio squeals wonderingly) (Emilio squeals excitedly) (cat snoring) - [Emilio] Uh oh! (cat howling) (Emilio screams) (telescope smashes) (Emilio wailing) (waltz music playing) - A little peek? (Van Gould groans) - You know the rules Governor, not until midnight! May I ask how you got came by that stone that's around your neck? - [Van Gould] It was found on the beach. - Oh, really? How very fortunate for you, sir. - I must and I shall know who you are! (Van Gould moaning) - I do hope I didn't step on your foot! - (moaning) It was nothing, my dear. (cord rips) (Emilio whining) (Emilio laughing) (cats snoring) - Uh oh! (Emilio yelling) (cats howling) (Balloon whirring) (cats growling) (door crashing) - Emilio, were you waiting for us? (Emilio squeals) - [Marco] What is it, little buddy? (Emilio squeals excitedly) - [Morgan] The green map, you found it! I'm on it! (Morgan grunting) At long last! The second clue to the treasure of the corsairs is ours! (door creaks) (door slams) (cats crashing) (cats meowing) (Carlitos sipping) - [Roberto] Hi there, cutie! - Hey! Who are you calling... I mean, oh my aren't you a fresh young man? - I'm Roberto. My uncle's the governor. - Really? How interesting. If that's true, you must know where he hides all the treasure maps, I suppose. - I know all my uncle's evil secrets. He trusts me, you see. And now if I could find some brave corsair to share them with. - Really? I mean, really? Well, then your wishes have been granted. Yes, for I am a corsair of the coast! - You're a corsair! I knew it! You really think I'd betray my uncle to a pirate scum like you? Uncle over here! Ow ow! - Oh, my stone! The stone, the Black Stone has been stolen! Valera! Valera! (Valera muffled yelling) (bladesaw buzzing) (ropes snapping) - [Roberto] Take that, corsair! - [Carlitos] Better a corsair than a brat like you! - [Roberto] Bet you never seen food like this before! (guest laughing) (guest moaning) - Hey! (mumbled yelling) (guests all yelling) - Ahh! Seize that woman! - Ah! Run! - Wait Valera, the map! Make sure the map is safe before you do anything! - Arrest that woman! You men, follow me! - Well, it looks like we did it Marco. Smooth sailing from now on. (cats meowing) (door crashes) - Morgan! I thought I could smell filthy pirate scum in here! - Huh? Van Gould's ship! How appropriate. Have a nice trip, Valera! (Valera yells) (bodies crashing) - This way. - Get after them, men! Don't let them get away! - Huh? (Morgan grunts) (Emilio squealing) (Van Gould yelling) - Time to get out of these clothes. Huh? (Yolanda groaning) (Carlitos yelling) (soldier moaning) - Perfect, this should do nicely! (guard yelling) - Stop! I order you to! Noo! (bodies crashing) (Van Gould yelling) - Thanks Carlitos. You know how to throw a party. (Carlitos grunting) (guests yelling) (food splatting) - This is but a taste of the just deserts coming to you Governor Van Gould. You and all the dogs like you shall pay dearly for my father's death. The spirit of the Black Corsair lives! - That's the last time I invite pirates to a charity scam. - [Guest In Brown Dress] What do yo mean scam? - [Male Guest] What do yoyu mean scam? - [Guest In Green Jacket] Yes, we want our money back, you cheating fat fraud! - Karmo! - Au revoir, me sweety pie! (maid sighs) Now don't tell me I missed all the fun! - It looks as if you made your own fun. - (laughing) Aye. - For the Corsairs of the Black Rose and the spirit of the Black Corsair. - As long as you live, my spirit will never die, my daughter. - No, never. - Just a little jump. (Marco grunting) (horse neighing) (Morgan yelling and grunting) (horse neighs) - There, you see? Didn't I tell you my plan would work? - Your plan? It was my plan! - Not again, you two. Now, come on! - After them! No, they're getting away! After them! Follow them! They're escaping! (horse hooves pounding) - [Valera] Noo! - [Group shouting] We're the Corsairs of the Black Rose! - [Captain Skull] With the black stone and the green map in their possession, our friends raced to Tuktakapen Island in search of the red scepter. Where Yolanda gets the biggest surprise of her life. - [Marco] Look Yolanda, there's a native settlement up ahead. - [Yolanda] Maybe they can help us. (ominous music) (mystical shimmering) (bird screeching) - I am Niala, queen of Daren and the daughter of the Red Corsair. - Then we're cousins, Niala. Because I'm Yolanda, daughter of the Black Corsair. - Friends, corsairs, this is the daughter of the Red Corsair. My cousin, Niala. - Niala, we will be faithful allies to your kingdom. So what do you say, corsairs? - [All] For the Corsairs of the Black Rose! (Emilio squeals) - Aww! (laughing) Here Niala, this is Emilio. I think he may have had a close encounter with some of your pet snakes earlier - I'm sorry Emilio, sometimes they get a bit wild. Say hello to our new friends. They are called Steal, Spit, and Bite. - [Captain Skull) Arr, me hearties! Legend has it that the mysterious red scepter is hidden somewhere within the ancient pyramid of Tuktakapen. (crowd cheering) - Goodbye! Goodbye! Wow! What do you think it means, Niala? (strange buzzing) - It's a calendar, Yolanda. That symbol marks the end of time. And once it has completed a full turn, the pyramid will collapse on us. - The Black Stone must be the key. Where are you going Emilio? (Emilio squealing) - Okay, this must be the way to fight against time. I'm sure of it. (music crescendos) - Look Yolanda, something is happening. (room exploding) Look Yolanda, it's my father's treasure. Ooh, ooh! Ahh! (mystical twinkling) I have been waiting for this moment for so long. - [Yolanda] Me too! (snakes hissing) (triumphant music) (crowd cheering) - Well they took their time, but they're here. - [Carlitos] They made it. (bird screaching) - This is where I live. My father the Red Corsair built this sanctuary for himself when he married my mother, the queen of our tribe. He said that the endless green of the treetops always served to remind him of the sea. - Maybe we'll have time for more reminiscences once Morgan gets back. He's gone to meet two natives who have information for us, Katun and Astul. (stone twinkles) - [Captain Skull] In search of the red scepter himself, Van Gould orders his men to attack Yolanda's native allies. - Leave us alone! Back you metal skinned demons! - [Man] Run, old man! Or suffer the consequences! - We must do as he says, Katun! Their sorcery is too powerful! (natives yelling) (birds screeching) - Have you seen Katun the elder, or Astul the warchief? - Demons in iron skins with no mercy attack us! (natives screaming) - What do you... Oh, Van Goulds men, you mean. Let me just even the odds. Ha! (Morgan grunts) (knife slicing) (soldiers moaning) That's two down and a hundred to go. Alright! Heeyah! (stomping) See, how you like a taste of your own medicine. - Now, this ought to clip your wings, Morgan. - Heeyah! Whoa! (Morgan crashing) - Jamban, what's going on here? I cannot believe Van Gould ordered you to do this. There's no honor in scaring these villagers. - Van Gould has no honor. But as long as he has the power, we must obey him. - No, I cannot accept that. We must do what is right. (Morgan groaning) - Morgan! I know we have been enemies in the past, but I now realize, I can no longer serve under Governor Van Gould. - I've always felt that one day you'd join us. - [Niala] I'm worried about Morgan, Yolanda. He should have returned with Katun and Astul by now. - But what about you, Niala. Do you have anyone special? - I have only seen him in my dreams. He comes like a vision of light. Wearing a helmet that flashes all the colors of the rainbow. I do not know his name, but when I see this man I shall know. (bird tweeting) - Hey! (bird chirping) (bird squawking) Hi there! I think your baby needs practice! - A mother Gluglu bird letting someone hold it's baby? - Someone carrying a helmet all colors of the rainbow? Morgan, are you all right? Morgan, what happened? - My dream has come true. - Hey I wasn't gonna harm the baby Gluglu bird, senorita... - Niala. - Here. (Morgan slurping) - I couldn't find Katun or Astul, Van Gould... - [Albert] Has attacked the people of Daren. - Then the corsairs will have to help them. - From now on you will also have my help. - Yo ho ho, me hearties. With all the keys to the treasure Yoland and the corsairs, including Albert and Niala, set sail for the Twin Treasure Islands. - Look, the twin islands! We made it! - [Captain Skull] Our heroes are unaware that the evil Governor Van Gould has followed them, and is fast approaching. - [Yolanda] Morgan, we've been wandering around in circles for hours. What kind of a treasure seeker are you? - [Carlitos] One that can't read a map. - Don't be ridiculous. I know exactly where to go. The green map says... (Morgan grunting) We are, well... - Why not admit it, we're lost Morgan. - Did you hear that, Emilio? We're lost. - We must ask the Nyla for help. - But the natives distrust outsiders like me. I'm sure they will never agree to help us, Niala. (earth rumbling) (all shouting) - Look the animals! (animals shouting) (Karmo and Emilio yelling) - Next time I'll roast ya! - [Niala] The animals are scared! They're running away from something! (monkey chattering) (Emilio squealing) - Huh? (monkey chattering) - What's he saying, Niala? - He says the fire gods are angry. - [Group] Fire gods? (Emilio squealing) - There, that's your fire god! The volcanoes erupting! (volcano exploding) - Whoa! (ax smashing) - That was close. - Phew! Thank you Marco. (ground rumbling) (group yelling) - We must find the treasure, before this volcano buries it all forever. (group moaning) - At last. (group sighing) - A corsair shouldn't sail on an empty stomach. - Come on now. A stomach as fat as that can't be empty. Karmo. (Marco laughing) - What, me fat? It's all muscle, look! (belt snapping) (group laughing) - And I tell you, this is the right hill! If only we could find the sword of justice, then we would find the treasure. - Any sword left by our fathers would have rusted away. It's over. This is it, Morgan! The sword of justice! (triumphant music) Now we know the location of the treasure! (group gasping) (ominous music) - Nothing, but according to the map the entrance to the underground chamber should be right about here. But what is here? Nothing but darkness and emptiness. The green map and the keys are just one big fat fraud. - I'm sure the treasure is right here. It's here under our very noses. I can almost smell it. - (chewing) Well let's follow our nose. (Karmo laughing) - A moaner and a comedian, that's all I need. Where are my brave corsairs now? Where's your true corsairs spirit? After everything we've been through together. Now you lose all hope? (group yelling) (upbeat music) - Don't do this on an empty stomach! - Don't let go, Albert! - Don't worry, I'll never let go! - It was hope you said, right? (Jamban laughing) - This is the underground chamber that everyone was looking for. - Jamban, your tracking skills are impressive. - Good, I have fulfilled my part of the bargain, Governor. Now it is your turn. You will now release my family. - Of course, Jamban. (Valera whining) Once the treasure is aboard my ship your family will be freed as promised. Right, Valera? - (whining) Yes, of course Governor. You can trust us. - [Largo] (laughing) You fool bone crusher. Your family escaped months ago! (laughing) - Shut up, you moron! - You will die for this! (Van Gould wimpering) (Jamban yelling) (knife clinking) - Valera you must save me! - Stay back, Jamban! (Jamban screaming) - Sure is a long way down. (upbeat music) (group yelling) - Wow, this cave is beautiful. - Hey that beam of light points the ground. Let's face it, we're never going to get out of here. - Let me just... The black rose! Here it is! And what's this hole for? Hey, wait a minute! I've got an idea. Give me the red scepter. - I have to admit you got me curious, Yolanda. - It fits! I knew the green map would guide us! But of course, tell me my friends, what is the color of hope? - Green, like a salad. - Our hope guided us here. Which is of course the green map. And red is the color of passion, just like the red scepter. - I think you may be on to something. (majestic twinkling) - All we need is a symbol for true love. Here, the black stone which stands for the unbreakable love we have for my father. Be guided by hope, ruled by passion, and be filled with the true love that you share. (light beam zapping) - [Niala] It's burning the outline of a door. - Ain't it great being a corsair, Emilio? (Emilio squeals) (group moans) - I can't believe the day has finally come. - You're right. Nothing could spoil this moment. - I should prepare a feast when all this is over. (Jamban screaming) - [Marco] Oh curses, Jamban! - If you've come for the treasure, Jamban, you'll have to defeat us first! - No, my fight is not with you. It is Governor Van Gould's head I wish to split. - Sure, but how do we know you can be trusted? (distant yelling) - [Group] Huh? - If you want to prove your loyalty to us Jamban, then I guess this is the moment. (Van Gould and his men yelling) - What do you want, Van Gould? - I'm here to collect my treasure, my dear. Now arrest them, Valera. - No one lies to Jamban, and I mean no one! (Valera and John yelling) - [Van Gould] What's happening Valera? (water spraying) (Van Gould and his men yelling) (Jamban groaning) - An excellent trick. You'll have to teach me one day. - [Jamban] If you think you are up to it, my puny little friend. - After what you did for us, Jamban, I suppose the only thing I can do is welcome you as our newest corsair. If that's alright with you, I mean. Yes? - [Everyone] For the Corsairs of the Black Rose. - Better late than never. I accept. For the Corsairs of the Black Rose! - [Group] For the Corsairs of the Black Rose! - Hey now, hold on a minute. Aren't we forgetting something? - [Yolanda] There's no handle, how do we open it? - We'll do it. (Marco laughing) (both banging) - [Yolanda] It's opening! - [Jamban] Stand back! (door crashing) (men groaning) - [Karmo] Well, what do you see? (all gasping) - [Yolanda] Our dream has come true. It's the corsairs treasure at last! - The riches of a hundred kingdoms! - All I ask is enough gold to eat like a king for the rest of me days. - Yay! (Emilio laughing) Hey, what's everyone waiting for, Emilio? As the pirates say, "It's far better to swim in gold, "than in the cold, cold, sea!" Hey! Hey! (Emilio cheering) - (laughing) Now we can free the people of Maracaibo! - So this is what we fought for. You gave us all the strength we needed. - Oh, Morgan. - That's my name! (Emilio squealing) - Oh, wait! - Huh? (Jamban and Marco laughing) - What now? - Morgan, come here. Who's tomb is this? It's some kind of writing. "Here lies the Black Corsair." My father's here! (Yolanda gasping) This says you can't rest until the black rose is here. - What's she doing? Who's she talking to? - The spirit of her father, the Black Corsair is here Jamban. - But I thought that he... (Karmo shushing) - Yolanda my brave daughter, listen well. Through your daring and courage, together with the help of your friends, you are close to finding the true treasure of the corsairs. A treasure greater than gold. - But father, we have the treasure here. - You must search beyond the seas of gold. Only in unity is there peace. Only in love is there unity. Love is the only real treasure, my dear Never lose sight of that. Father, father wait! Father please, please don't leave me! - I will always be a part of you. Open your heart. The black rose, the symbol of your mother, will guide you to your real treasure. - Come back! - (sniffing) What a stink! That can only mean one thing! - [Van Gould's Men] You're right. - [Van Gould] You thought you got rid of me? - Huh? - [Yolanda] Van Gould, what do you want here? Planning to humiliate yourself again? - I am at your service, marm. - Agh, 'tis traitor's payday, Jamban! - Your days are numbered, Largo! Belay there, son of a slave! - Your breath's worse than cold steel! - How kind of you to find the treasure for me. But now I will take care of it. - Hey, we found the treasure first! Finders keepers! (Emilio yelling) (Van Gould blows raspberry) - Yeah! - That's right! - Get him! - This is all you get! (cat howling) - Now that felt really good. - Don't just stand there, Valera. Attack, you fool. - With great pleasure, Governor. Largo, men, you'll all follow me. - Charge! (Valera yelling) (swords clashing) - You must be getting old, Valera. - (yelling) I'll take you alone. You never can get me, you brat. The booty's ours! - Believe me, I'll move heaven and earth to keep this treasure from you Valera. (cave rumbling) (all yelling) - Aah! Choo! - [Niala And Albert] Bless you, Karmo. - Achoo! What were you saying about moving heaven and earth Yolanda? (rocks crashing) (soldiers yelling) - It's getting worse! - Soldiers, take the treasure! - Another time, corsairs! (cave crumbling) - We should get out too! (Emilio squealing) (group yelling) - [Yolanda] What's happening? (group yelling) - [Karmo] Let's hope it's not out of the frying pan, into the fire. - I can't look! - Enough, Marco! There's still a chance, stay calm. - The treasure, it's sailing away! - [Marco] Yeah, but where are we headed? - [Yolanda] My father's tomb! - [Albert] If we ever get out of here Niala, I hope... (all yelling) (rock crashing) - The village of Alen, they're in danger! - What? We'll have to help them! (rocks crashing) - Now only a miracle can save us. - Please don't worry, chief. We're here to help your village. You've got to move your people. - It's too late. The gods are angered by the white man's booming fire. - Booming fire? - The one who calls himself the Governor. His people have angered the gods, look. - That's gunpowder. And if we don't move it in time... - The entire village will be blown to bits. Come on! - [Albert] Gunpowder, but if the fire reaches it... - But why should I believe you? You're one of them! And you helped bring this curse upon my people! - No, you're wrong! Albert is good, he is! And he helped us fight for justice! - Once I did help Governor Van Gould, but now it's my responsibility to make things right. Trust me, my love, and wish me luck. I'll be fine. - What does he think he's doing? - He's moving the gunpowder away from the village! - [Albert] Only a controlled explosion can change the route of the lava. - A what? No my darling, oh you mustn't! - The treasure of the corsairs. Isn't it beautiful? And it's mine. Do you hear me? And it's all mine! What do you mean by saying 'tis all your treasure, Van Gould? 'Tis our treasure! And to make sure you don't forget that... (cats howling) Ah, come to Papa me little darlings. - What do you think you're doing, Largo? Release my babies. - Only after I gets what's coming to me. (laughing) (ominous music) - If I'm right about this, the lava will miss the village. If not I could destroy the entire island. Oh, no! (Albert grunting) (rocks clinking) One, two, come on! (fuse sizzling) Oh no, the fuse has gone out! Niala my darling, if anything happens to me know that I have always loved you, and I always will! (fuse sizzling) - Albert my darling! No, my love, no! - Niala, wait! (fuse sizzling) (gunpowder exploding) (Albert yelling) - The great gods of fire have been appeased! This time our village has been spared! - Albert, where are you Albert? Noo! Albert! Ooh! (Niala kissing) It cannot be! - Albert sacrificed himself to save the village. - Yeah, he was a real hero. - Yolanda, what are you talking about? He is alive, isn't he? - Of course he is. He'll be fine, see? - [Karmo] Enough of that! There must be something we can do to save him. - [Morgan] Take him back to the village. We'll check out the area. - [Marco] There isn't a moment to lose. - [Niala] We must hurry. - [Morgan] Well, come on Yolanda. Let's get this over with. (upbeat music) Dead end! (Morgan stomping) (earth crumbling) (Both yelling) (splashing) (Morgan grunting) - Hey are you two okay? - Over there, look a cave! - Look it's the black rose! Yolanda, what's happening? - I don't know Morgan, but I do know that I must follow my heart! And I shall! (villagers moaning) (ominous music) - Albert sacrificed himself to save your people. You must save him if you can! - All hope is not yet lost. I will do what I can, but I can promise you nothing. - Oh, help him please! - Huh? - Look at that! Do you know what this place is, Morgan? - I have no idea. - The black rose! Morgan, my mother! - It says, two hearts that beat as one, two souls forever joined, come to me my love, my Black Corsair. I shall know no rest until you are by my side. It's just like on your father's tomb. (Emilio crying) - Morgan, that's it. Both my parents were buried on different, but very close islands, Alen and Nyla. Their souls were separated when they died in different places. And, well, the two graves... I've got it, yes. Neither of them can rest until the other is by their side. They must be brought together. - Well yes, but how? (earth rumbling) (all yelling) (all moaning) - Morgan, look! The islands, they're moving towards each other! (both yelling) (music crescendos) (both moaning) - I think it's all over! (Emilio cheering) - Look, what's that? I, I don't believe it! Look, it's incredible! They found each other. - [Yolanda] Love triumphs over all. And may their souls finally rest in peace. (majestic music) (all gasping) Truly there is no greater power, than the power of love. Of course, now I understand what my father meant, Morgan. - What your father meant about what? - The real treasure, Morgan, is to find true love that is unbreakable and everlasting. Love makes you richer than any treasure filled. - No, it's not true. I refuse to give up! - How is Albert? Will he be alright, do you think? (Emilio crying) - My magic may not be powerful enough! - It's nature. The power of nature is needed. Hear me spirits of the wild! Hear me animals of the forest, birds of the air, and creatures of the sea! I need your help! Give me your powers that I might save my one and only Albert! (light zapping) (crowd moaning) (Niala moaning) - Niala? Huh? But I had a dream I was flying, I... - You're alive! Of course you were flying, my love! And you landed in my arms! (everyone cheering) (ominous pirate music) - More gold than I thought possible. There is nothing more satisfying than showering in one's own treasure. - Now don't you mean our treasure, Governor? - Of course I meant to say that, "our treasure," Captain. - [Yolanda] The only think you'll get from Van Gould, Captain Largo, (cats howling) - Huh? - apart from treachery and insults, is a knife between your ribs! Come on, for the Corsairs of the Black Rose! - [Group] For the Corsairs of the Black Rose! - It's those confounded corsairs again. Well, don't just stand there Valera, destroy them. And you too, Largo. - You can count on me, Governor. Attack! (soldiers yelling) - It's the catch of the day! Not leaving already? - You again! - But the fun's just starting! You'll stay, won't you? - Look at you, you were once a lady. A woman of refinement. But what are you now? Nothing but a filthy pirate. A disgrace. The scum of the seven seas. - You're the scum. You're a disgrace to your office. You betrayed your own people and killed my father. But I, Yolanda the daughter of the bravest corsair on the seven seas, will make you pay dearly. - Yes I thought you might feel that way. But let's see how you feel after this! (knife swooshes) - Thank you, and what a beautiful dagger. - I never would have believed such a thing if I had not seen it for myself. - Just stick around my friend. After all, she's Yolanda, the daughter of the Black Corsair. - I'm sorry but I can't accept gifts from people like you, Governor of evil. So I better give it back... To you! (knife stabbing) (Van Gould moaning) - For the Corsairs of the Black Rose! - [All] The Corsairs of the Black Rose! (twinkling music) - By the power of the spirit of the wind, the spirit of the water, and the spirit of the earth, let these two be joined together in body and soul, for all the days of their lives. Their union shall be an example to us all. Their love shall endure forever. - Oh, my love. (Emilio cheering) - I can't help it. I always eat when I'm happy. (crowd laughing) - And you two, I woulda bet a month's plunder that you would get married. (Yolanda and Morgan laughing) - Yolanda's undecided. - You think so? - Brave corsairs, to marry Morgan I'd need the patience of a saint. (laughing) - So what, what's gonna to happen next, huh? - Take my word as a pirate, Carlitos. Whatever happens, well, it won't be boring. (upbeat dance music) - Father. - Yes, Yolanda. Your mother and I are proud of you. Really proud. We both wanted you to know that. You're the best daughter a man could have. - Father, can you please tell me, will I ever be as deeply in love as you and mother? - Yes, my child. But remember, love often comes along when you least expect it. You must be able to see it. (Yolanda gasps) (rose exploding) - [Black Corsair] For the Corsairs of the Black Rose. - Now and Always, for the Corsairs of the Black Rose!
