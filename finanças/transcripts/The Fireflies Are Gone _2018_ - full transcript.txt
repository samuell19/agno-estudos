We invited your godparents. Hello, godparents. - Hi. You still have your school clothes on? I didn't expect guests. And no makeup? Kids these days! She's beautiful anyway. Pass me yours? Happy birthday, dear. Happy birthday, Léonie. - Thank you. Do I look like a cheap whore? Here. A nice change! I wouldn't want to overdo it. It's lovely. What's good? Everything here. You'll graduate soon! A month till exams. Have you thought of your future? It's not 1960 anymore, Godmother. Today kids try not to think of the future. You know what I mean. I always know what you mean. And next year? No idea. I don't get it. Such a good student. You must have some idea. I'm not sure. I'd love to work, to do PR for a big multinational. I love travel, exotic places... The Caymans, Bahamas, Bermuda... on the Havens Channel. Work in the new economy, do PR for an oil company or a pharmaceutical. Not sure. Defending scumbags. I love challenges. Maybe government. I thought of finance — I loved the film with DiCaprio. When I was younger. `Cause he's gotten pudgy. But I'm still young. I still have time. She knows what she wants. It's in her genes. Her father's girl... Got a summer job? Last year we didn't have a summer. No. She has to find a job, and fast. No lazing around. Lined up anything? Sure, with the Augustinian Sisters. Will you take your vows? I'm serious, in their kitchen. Really? Though if you think about it, the good sisters have to eat. Not just pray. Fine idea. Bravo! Bet they don't eat much. It'll be easy. Original. Better get with it. The good jobs are already gone. I heard you. I'm on it. I don't want you underfoot. Zero danger. My pals at city hall... Know Pierre Simard? Head of Leisure. He'd hire her. Can I get rice instead of fries? Handy to have a stepdad who everybody knows. Very. But I can manage on my own. I can't help her with the nuns. What're you having? - Pasta. Steak'n fries, if I can have rice. I always take a T-bone, it's the best. Guy, Guy! Isn't your steak the best? Hey Paul. - Guy owns the place. Sorry, I just wanted to wish you a nice evening and say that tonight's on the house. You're my guests. That's so kind! And it's my stepdaughter's birthday. Glad to hear it. Happy birthday, Léonie. Thanks, my friend. - Have fun! Thanks! Let me take another look. So your show's doing well. My lawyers are raking it in. So things are good. I'll wash my hands. She's a funny one. The Fireflies Are Gone Paul, king of the airwaves Hi, Dad. Thanks! At dinner with Mom. You know. Yeah, and you? When are you back? Freezing your ass off? The time will zip by. Nothing special. How are you? Me too. I'll see you soon. Thanks for calling. I know. Bye. Hey. - Hi. And your dinner? Cancelled. OK, boys! Sauces aren't toys. If you don't stop, I'll take them away. Hey, "Chez Line!" Are you Céline? No, despite the resemblance. Not the first time I hear that. Do you think he drives a DeLorean? How was life in 1985? Hey, kids. I warned you! Put your shirt on or leave. Get it? This is a restaurant, not the beach. Nice evening? Yeah, you? Don't do that again! OK? Promise. Your present. I'll give it to you anyway. Your godparents contributed. I just learned something. Get ready, this is big. Here goes: We haven't had fireflies in the region for 10 years. Lightning bugs, glowworms, fireflies... They've disappeared. Nobody knows why. All gone. Maybe you knew, but I didn't. I don't remember ever seeing'em. But I live in town, it's normal. The news is that some very smart people... university researchers, you know... They say it's our fault the fireflies are gone. Too much noise, light, pollution. We need to stop development 'cause of the fireflies. My granddad and great-granddad, before building a bridge or a road, a shed or village... Think they said, Y'know, dear. I'm not going logging today. The poor fireflies! Let's stay in bed. There are fireflies! That's how it is now. "Don't step in that puddle, there could be tadpoles. If we listened to all those people, we'd never do anything. We built this country `cause we didn't care. The Indians? We didn't give a damn! Me, I'm not PC, not part of the machine. Did you read that newspaper article? In light of the ethical questions we've been discussing, who wants to share their opinion? Léonie? Seriously? Yes, seriously. I didn't raise my hand. - And why not? I didn't want to. Everyone else did. I didn't. Is it obligatory? No, but you're the exception. Yeah, but... I didn't want to. I'd like to know why. My opinion's for me. Why? Everyone wants to give their opinion. Really? - They volunteered. I don't know what to say. What's your sign? Your sign? Guess. Scorpio? No. Libra? Leo. Virgo? Gemini? Am I warm? Getting warmer. Aquarius? Cancer? Libra? You said that. My husband was a Libra, and he sure was no winner! Pisces? Sagittarius? Aries? I said them all. Wait, Taurus? Don't you have a sign? You missed one. Capricorn! Bravo. You look it. What's your trick? Intuition. What do you do, Mr Capricorn? Wait, lemme guess. You're a lawyer. I'm a musician. A musician? - I teach guitar. Interesting. For beginners? All kinds. My kind? All kinds. I tried once but I was awful. Lousy teacher. I've taken dance, swimming, gymnastics, violin, piano... I even studied taekwondo. But I always quit after a month. Why? I get bored. A month's not long. What's your name? My name's Léo. Léo? Is that your real name? No, moron. My name's Leon. And yours? Guess. Steve. No! What's your trick? Intuition. Intuition. So you're here to see Sister Marthe, correct? I spoke to her a few weeks ago. She said to come this week. It's for the kitchen, correct? Yes. For a summer job? That's correct. You see... Who are you anyway? You're not a nun, are you? No, no. I'm not a nun. I handle their affairs. The administration, buildings and everything. The nuns are getting old. They need help. But for the kitchen it's Sister Marthe, right? Sister Marthe passed away last week. It was Sister Marthe who ran the kitchen, yes. Now it's Sister Pierrette. And me. OK. But... We don't need anyone, I'm afraid. She told me she needed someone. For the summer! We already hired someone. We didn't know that... You see? Yeah, I see. Jesus Christ! Goddamn fucking nun bitches! Can't trust'em, shit! Paul, can you call me? What's the number again of your friend at Leisure? Thanks. Hello. How much is the brown guitar? 40. 50 with the case. Is it a good guitar? We only sell the very best. Top of the line. That one belonged to Paco de Lucia. Heard of Paco de Lucia? That's enough, Bobo! Simmer down! I'm here for a lesson. Go round the back. They're in the basement. Look... Practice that. See you Tuesday? Yup. - Cool. I'll just have a smoke. You bought it? Yeah. Oh, boy! Is it OK? Gotta change the strings. But it'll do for now. Anyway, like I said, I quit after a month. It's a pretext. A pretext? To see how you live. If you pay your phone bills. Great album. Is she your mom? You like living with her? We make do. This your bedroom? Yup. How old are you? Way older than you. Not bad. The talent to go with the look. Ever played in a band? Meh. What, you're too good? I prefer playing alone. Steve! Steve, the dog! Wanna come walk the dog? Have you lived here long? All my life. Strange, I never saw you. I don't go out much. You stay in your basement? That's it. Dad says a bay can be looked at two ways. If you look this way, it's an opening on the world. The other way, and it's a dead-end. End of the road. Am I the dead-end? No, the dead-end's the town. Life's good here. Are you nuts? It's a town full of zombies. It's dead. Everyone bugs me. Everything's ugly! There's kids and old people, nothing in between. It's not so bad. Yes, it is so bad. You walk an old lady's Yorkshire? Not a Yorkshire, a Shih Tzu. It's my mom's. And you walk it? It's not exactly manly. Mom has a sore leg. You seem like a nice boy. And you seem like a piece of work. Why don't you leave? What's stopping you? I have no money, haven't finished school. After summer, maybe. When the time's right. I like it here since they tore down the mill and planted all that grass. My dad worked there. Sorry. No worries. Did he work there long? He was union president. I remember the media uproar around it. Quite the uproar. Listen up. Get a load of this! Today's paper says the employees of the DepotMax store... That's 350 people... They want to unionize. Yup. Oh, boy! Poor workers feel lonely. They want to unite, organize. So what's gonna happen? They'll close the store. Bye-bye jobs. Know what I think? Union agreements are rules for kids' play. They turn men and women into little babies. Into incompetents, slackers, good-for-nothings. They change intelligent men and women... Your boyfriend's on fire. No one's forcing you to listen. Easy to say. Like some toast? No, not right now. Don't you have school? I start later today. Did you find a job? I'm meeting Paul's friend in Leisure. Great! Why didn't it work out with the nuns? It just didn't. I'm taking guitar. Is that a joke? Light guitar strings, please. Yes, sir. Karl, for $500, what's making you mad? Anything else? I'll check out your guitars. No problem. What'll you do with the $500, Karl? - Put up a fence. Here. You got me new strings! How nice! OK, what do I do? The strings: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The fingers on your left hand: 1, 2, 3, 4. If I say, put your 2nd finger on the 2nd fret, 5th string... Good. 3rd finger, 2nd fret, 4th string. Strum it. Play the chord. E. Add finger 1 on the 1st fret of the 3rd string. Yes. E major. Major. Minor. Strum it. You never wanted to do this? What do you mean? As a career. Go to Montréal. Play in a band. Meh. Meh? You always say meh. Meh. Things good? - Yeah, you? Léo, this is Jayden. Jayden! Léo, like my new wheels? Cool. The radio. Check the radio. 7:30. It's the morning show. The show to get honest working folk going. You know my dream? - What? To go on welfare. Funny? Take off my tee, tan on the balcony. - Not funny? Your humor stinks. Well, I think it's funny. Leave her alone. You're such a dork. This will be a big part of the exam. You'll have to be very organized. Make sure you take good notes. If there's anything you don't understand, I'm here. Raise your hand and I'll come over. At the start. Later you'll need to be independent. That's our goal. Yes, come! Léonie? The job's to look after the ballfield at the arena. Turn the lights on and off, maintain the field... I was told it was for the library. No, no. I need someone right away. Days, school. Nights, work. Why'd you apply? Why should I hire you? Well, I understand what you're looking for and I think I'm right for the job. I'm responsible, well-organized. I'm a fast learner and I'm available evenings. You're Paul's step-daughter? He's my mom's boyfriend. And you're also Sylvain's daughter? We're a family full of contradiction. Very different men. Is my dad a problem? No, I asked because he's a good friend. A friend? Yes, a friend. I worked in the union with him in the old days. I respect your dad. He was a good leader. He didn't get much support when he needed it. His mistake was, he put everyone else first. That's a mistake? It can become one. If you're the only one thinking that way. Where is he now? He was shipped up north. Not as punishment, but... That was about his only option. He lives in a trailer. Three months there, ten days here. He has a place here. Glad to know that. Nice, working for the city. I'm not blaming you. Can I steal a fry? I haven't had lunch. Sure, help yourself. Here's the storage shed. This is where we keep the maintenance gear. You have the mop, sink, shovels, rake. The machine to lay the lines, but I'll come back to that. But most important are the lights. You flip the breaker. That's it. It takes 15-20 minutes to come on. - 15? They're mercury lamps. Take time to warm up. Got it? Yeah, not much to it. So first thing you do is turn on the lights or they'll play in the dark. These are your keys. Let's go. The moon is human. Maybe more human than us. Maybe we're the grey rocks. You come up with weird stuff. I'd like to be a writer. Good idea. So become a writer. Impossible. Why? You have to like people. I don't. It's not my thing. I'm like the Queen in Alice in Wonderland. Off with their heads! Ever played in a stadium? Like, in a big show? So your dad worked here? Yeah, here. That part they tore down. See? Straight down there. Here and right there. It's crazy, huh? My dad often brought me when I was little. The center of the mill. That's where machine no. 5 was. Machine no. 4 was there. And that was the workers' entrance. Carole was watchman. She gave us candies. The lockers were there. My dad's too. You see? When they closed the mill, he wasn't allowed to empty it. None of the men were. Their stuff was all shoved in garbage bags and handed to them: Here! Everybody blamed the closing on my father. The media, the radio, they were baying for blood. In the end he had to leave. Remember how it was? Yay, the show for early birds. For honest working folk! King of the air waves! Mom, can you take me to the airport tomorrow? Dad's arriving. You spoke? Yeah. Picking up your dad's not my job. Drop me off. I want to surprise him. His truck's there. Alright. I was walking by the bay. There were some tourists with a young child, maybe 2 or 3 years old. They were taking a selfie with the bay behind. You know, a family photo. But the child was howling, wouldn't keep still. They were having the damndest time. I asked if I could help. They said yes. I reached to take the camera... It was a phone, not a camera. When I reached for the camera, I mean phone... the mom handed me the kid. Can you believe it? She gave me the child, not the phone. They took the photo, all smiles. A nice selfie with the bay and no kid. Were they French? No, I think German, or something. You said you spoke to them. He said yes. No, they didn't speak, just nodded. I can't remember. So why Germans? I can't remember. Maybe they said yes in German. I dunno. Hi, is flight ET828 on time? No, it'll be a little late. Hey there. What's this? - A little surprise. How'd you get here? - Mom drove me. Your mom? Do you have luggage? - No, just this. You look good. You're easy to please. How's it going? It sucks. We work 70 hours a week. There's nothing to do. I'm glad to be back. For how long? In two weeks. Then another 12 weeks. Like a sailor. A sailor, yeah. And at home? Things OK? Don't ask stupid questions. Paul's still a dumbass? If only. I think he's getting worse.
