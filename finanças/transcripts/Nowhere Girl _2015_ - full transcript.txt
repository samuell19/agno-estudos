The school festival starts in a week. Everyone must finish their projects before that. After the festival, you will prepare yourselves for your final projects. Be sure not to slack. It's his third cigarette today. - "Be sure not to slack". - You sound like him! Such nonsense. Oh, that is cute. Do you have a date, perhaps? It's not like that. - How about karaoke afterwards? - Yes! Sounds good. Karaoke, huh? Oh, about that... Is she gone again? She is not gone. She is free. - She has free choice. - Are you jealous? - That's not it. - Such an annoying bitch. Well, she is sick, after all. - In what way? - It's called PT or something. - What is that? - A mental illness. She is back at it again. Let her do as she pleases. But we can't give her special treatment forever. For a girl like her, this is the best medicine. So, this is the mere shadow of our praised genius and honor student? Are you aware of her disturbance? PTSD. Post-trau... What was it again? Post-traumatic stress disorder. The management even sent her to study abroad. It's not her fault. What in the hell's name is she trying to do? I wonder... Maybe even she doesn't know herself? Even she... doesn't know? In that case, this art object could be... the only clue we have for elucidating her unconscious. Her unconscious? If we could elucidate that... we might be able to find a treatment for her. Do we really have to play favorites with her? It doesn't make sense anymore to use her in advertisement. If registrations keep declining like they are now... Management would have to intervene. Isn't that right? Cure her. At any cost. Again? They're happening a lot lately. Do the painkiller help, more or less? - I see, that's good. - I can't sleep. Don't force yourself to do it. You might think otherwise, but the body always sleeps somehow. I want to sleep more. - You are already sleeping. - I am not! If you believe you can't sleep, take two of these. Go home at six o'clock. Yes! - I'll go home. - You are going? - Let's go. - Yes. Does your highness have an overnight accommodation? Stop sleeping. The musical department works so hard. But making us listen to the same song day after day... They should try putting themselves into our shoes. Yes, right? An earthquake! It's fine! Don't panic! Don't panic, okay? Ringing ears? Which noise? Something comes flying around. Similar to a bird. A bird? A big flock is coming. Are you afraid? I'm not afraid, but... But? I don't want to hear the sound. A bird? Yes, that's what she keeps saying. A bird, huh? I think we should put her in a hospital with specialists. Stricter restrictions imposed on her... would have the opposite effect. Restrictions? And she is getting restricted exactly by what? There is no precedent for a case like this. Normally, she would have been kicked out already. You really... understand nothing. I understand she was needed to keep this school running. Now, she is nothing but a burden. She will definitely get over it. You really must like her a lot. I just don't want... to see her talent... get buried in darkness. That's all? In any case, I have approval from above. That's something... you shouldn't forget. Note: Deadline for the second art class was last week. For those who didn't make the deadline, there'll be an extension till next Friday. Doctor, my head hurts. No more medicine. Stop that. I have a headache. I'm unable to sleep because of it. It's okay. Try to sleep tight. It'll be okay. Inhale slowly. Stop. One, two, three, four. Exhale slowly. Stop. One, two, three, four. Inhale. Stop. One, two, three, four. Exhale. Stop. One, two, three, four. Inhale. Stop. One, two, three, four. Exhale. Stop. One, two, three, four. Inhale. Stop. One, two, three, four. Exhale. Box breathing, huh? What did I do? Nothing. That's why you are making me feel sick. Don't take it personal. I told you. Let sleeping dogs lie. For those who think they won't finish in time, we can arrange for some extra classes in here. Yes. How lame! Good one! What's up? Do you suddenly feel like drawing? You can't trick me with your false play. I don't know what your problem is, but this here ain't no hospital or rehab center. Nevertheless... It's a fact, you are one of my dearest students. To improve a handicapped student... is a teacher's duty. Life is full of different joys. It's not too late... to get to know them before you die. Let us begin. "Leviathan" by Thomas Hobbes - Her highness has arrived. - She is early today. Do you want to teach her a lesson again? Let her be. She's way beyond our reach. Hey. We are currently working on a human portrait. Athena. The goddess of wisdom and of war. What the heck are you fighting against? What the hell are you doing? Sit! Sit down and be quiet! Her hallucinations are getting worse. I think it's obvious that she has to be transferred to a suitable institution. Her guardian is, I believe, on her mother's side. Do you have her contact? Once, in the student housing, no matter how much I contacted her, she insisted the girl is our problem. I heard she doesn't even visit the housing in recent days. Forget about the school festival. She'll probably not even make it to her graduation. I never said I have given up on her. If only she were to finish her graduation project, I would respect your opinion. The art object in the auditorium... You mean that thing? What can it be? She better hurry up and finish it. The auditorium's demolition starts next week. Demolition? You weren't aware of it? For some reason, it's old, and somewhat dangerous. And, with all the earthquakes these days, it might fall apart at any moment. Looks like the medicine is working. I gave her what I usually do. Vitamin pills. She doesn't need sleeping pills. You think if someone who's lost in delusions... gets put into a deeper sleep would be endangered? Yes... She should not be escaping into sleep. She should hurry up and awaken herself. How's your wrist? Just fine. - Don't overdo it. - I said it's fine. It looks like you are living here. Don't worry. I won't let anyone get in your way. Huh? I'm promising you that. In return, you promise me something. Eat well and lay down, even if you can't sleep. If you do that, your period will come back and you will get healthy again. It's been months since you had it, right? How can you live like that? I don't care, being like this. That's not good. You have to get healthy. Otherwise, you will stay like this. I'm fine like this. This is the best I've ever been. You could die. I don't care about dying. No way. I won't let you die. Doctor, why are you so interested in me? Because you are my patient. At least, I am not your enemy. I ask myself if that's the case. Good morning. We heard you're doing something strange in the auditorium. Why are you getting special treatment? Oh. Maybe there's something going on between you and your smug teacher. Did I guess it right? Why are you here? You. Why are you here? Why are you here? - Who is she? - I don't know. Never seen her here before. - Perhaps I have seen her once. - Maybe an exchange student? Nobody would be interested in being an exchange student here. Let's go to the new cafe at the stadium after school. - Yes? - I don't have any money now. - Me neither. - My treat, then. - Great! - Amazing! Hang in there! Why are you here? If you keep eating like that, your body won't get cured. Without regaining your health, you won't get your sanity back. Be sure to eat well. - Doctor. - Yes? What do you mean by "getting my sanity back"? For starters, it means not asking that kind of question. Without regaining your health, you won't get your sanity back. What do you mean by "getting my sanity back"? For starters, it means not asking that kind of question. What the heck are you fighting against? Why are you here? Name verification. Cheating is not tolerated. Return right now. It's okay! Calm down! Don't panic! It's fine! Who are you? I am... a soldier. The girl didn't make it. She stayed unconscious and died an hour ago. Both her body and soul. Huh? That's right. Her body and soul. But you did make it back. I am not sure if this is a world you want to come back gladly. Looks like the front won't hold much longer. Front...? She regained consciousness again. I don't mind if the useless die. Lieutenant, don't say that... The enemy is just around the corner. I don't care if it's a war trauma. Halfhearted wounded soldiers, I can't afford to have them. - What are you doing? - I must go. Impossible. Not in your state. Thank you, Doctor. But my unit is waiting. Useless. Warning. The enemy's armored division is closing in. Battalion scale. Platoon leaders gather. Each platoon, check equipment and take position.
