[♪] General Muster. Any news, colonel? Now that the Indians have been subdued, these cattle rustlers are proving even a greater menace. Can't we do something, sir? We certainly can. I'll send my three best scouts after them. If they can't handle the situation, nobody can. Sound the scout call. [BUGLE CALL] [BOTH GROWLING] The call. [ALL YELLING] Attention! Reporting for duty, Buffalow Billious. Wild Bill Hicup. Just Plain Bill. Men, the cattle rustlers have become a scourge. The government wants them completely wiped out.

Hey, Tex, I just got word through the grapevine that Buffalow Billious has his scouts lookin' out for us. They are, eh? Warn the outpost to keep a sharp lookout. If they see anyone suspicious, let 'em have it. Those are the fellas we're after. [GRUNTS] Mmm. A hit-and-run rider. Shut up. We better sneak up a little closer. Maybe we can find out who the big boss is. Come on. [BARKING] Hey, shh, shh. Quiet, will you? [BARKING] That dog must have a rabbit on that there bush. I reckon I'll shoot it. Dig him out. Dig him out, and I'll shoot him. Hurry, he's burrowing in. Come on. Come on. [GUNSHOT] You wanna give away our hideout? What are you shootin' for? Here, chop some brush for the fire.

Now we gotta get rid of those cattle, pronto. Listen... How do I look? Good. No one will ever know us in these outfits. I hope. Now, remember, you're a big gambler from the West. [BARKS] Hi, toots.
