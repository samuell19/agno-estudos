Where are you? What did you do last night? Put your head together. What did you do? Help me. Where the hell are you? Come on. Remember. Is anyone there? Can you please help me? Somebody. Anybody. Who am I? Why am I? Remember, damn it. Don't scream. Why are you screaming? Don't just stand there staring at me; say something. Hello. What's happened to me? What's going on? I need to think. There's gotta be an explanation. I'm dreaming. I've got to wake up. I need to snap out of this, you hear me? Think, think. Drugs. I don't. There's gotta be a reason. Please don't let this be happening. Who's there? I need help, help me! Is anyone in there? Can you please get me out of here? Open the door. - Don't open the door. - What? Don't open it. It might be them. I need to get out. I have to get out.. No, you don't. No matter what, don't open the door. What are you talking about? Answer me. It might be them. Shh. Where are they? They're gone, they won't be back for a while. How do you know? You don't know that. I just woke up here. I don't know where I am. I don't know who I am. That's what you always say. You do seem familiar. Who are you? I don't know either. You don't know your own name? Do you know yours? Then why should I? Where in the hell are we? Here, there. Everywhere. What are you talking about for Christ's sake? Do you want to play a game? It'll take your mind off things No, I don't. Who were they? They're the ones who hurt people. He's the worst but she's no better. She tries to be nice but she's not. Really, she's not. The one with no eyes. Oh, no, silly. She's nice. She's here too. What do you mean, here? Stuck here. There. Everywhere. Is it him? Oh no, he doesn't knock. He just comes in. Just comes and goes whenever he pleases. You never know. What do I do? I don't know. I keep telling you not to open it. But if he doesn't knock then it's not him, right? It's not him. Have you opened this door before? Oh, no, I'm too afraid. Who's there? Who are you? I think we should open it now. What? You keep telling me not to. Oh, like you ever listen to me. I don't even know you. Silly, lady, you never know what you're talking about. Who are you? I said, who are you? Oh, I don't like him. Make him go away. I know him. From where? I can't remember. What's your name? Stay away from us. Why are you here, what do you want? He's funny. What do you think? I think I want to go home. God damn it! Get the fuck away from me! Leave me alone! Why? - You know who I am. - Do you? - I don't know. - Neither do I. Than again, who does? Who are you talking to? That guy, the crazy talking to himself. - What guy? - Him. - Nobody's here. - He's right there! He's walking around in front of us, look. - Open your... - If he's here he should say something. A little hello would be nice. Perhaps a goodbye every now and again. - Where did he come from? - Outside. You let somebody in? Oh, you can't ever let anyone in, do you hear me? - Don't let anyone in. - I didn't let him in. - You can't let anyone in! - Why? Why what? - How long have you been here? - Here? Here in this room. We're in a room? I can't see any room. How are you getting in and out of here? How's the girl getting in and out of here? You better tell me. I didn't see a girl. Fuck! Somebody get me out of here. What was that? I didn't hear anything. Help me. Only a moment. He'll be here in only a moment. He'll be here in a minute. He'll be here in just one minute. And he's got to be happy. Got to be happy. Do you understand? No, I don't understand. I don't know where I am. You've got to be a good little poppet. Got to be nice. You shouldn't have done that. No, you shouldn't have done that at all. He won't be happy. No, I'm not going to be happy at all. You should know by now about touching her. I've never seen you before. What do you want from me? What I always want. You know what I like. Why are you being so prissy? You're not fooling anyone. Just keep away. Don't touch me. I especially like that little thing you do with your mouth. Pretty little mouth. Give it to him the way he likes it. Hey! You're not behaving. You have to behave or I'll punish you again. I could give you a tongue lashing. Would you like that? I bet you'd love it. Time to run, time to hide. Something tickling your funny bone? Look at me. You stupid bitch. You are very brave. I'll tell you what's going to happen here, little miss prissy. I'm gonna get me another little piece of you for my collection. I'm gonna tame you. I'm going to humiliate you. No, don't! No, don't! Stop behaving badly. Good behavior. No, please. No! What happened here? This isn't real. Why are you doing this to me? I can't even say I deserve this because I don't know who I am. I don't even know what I've done. Please, God, no one deserves to go through this. No one deserves this. Only living sluts, of course. You're sitting there asking God why. Why? It's all your fault, you little jezebel. I'm not a jezebel, I'm good. I'm good. But you let him fuck you from behind, didn't you? Unchaste whore. Sodomy is a sin. You asked to burn in hell for your sins. - I asked for this? - You did. Women shall bend to the service of man. That piece of filth was raping me. Of course he wasn't. Man shall rule woman with his own mighty fist as if his fist were the hand of God. Jesus Christ, make it stop. You're a slut. A divorced damsel. Look at you. You got perky titties all right for sucking, and that juicy wet cunt all right for fucking. And those clothes, sinner's clothes they are. What unclean man wouldn't want to fuck you in those clothes, you little temptress? Hide yourself as Eve hid herself in the garden. You are a temptress. You want man to idolize you. You want man to turn his eyes away from our Lord and fuck you like a bitch. Milk suckling slut. - Am I a slut? - Of course you're a slut, my sweet. But you can repent. Repent now, sinner. I don't know what my sins are. You are the alter of evil upon which men spill their seed. You've turned man's eyes away from God. That is your sin. I did this to myself, didn't I? - I'm being punished. - Confess your crimes. - Reveal yourself. - What do I reveal? - That you're a cunt whore. - No! Tell me what's going on, help me. Tell me where I am. Don't do that, why are you doing that? He wants you to think. How do you keep getting out? I don't understand. There are spaces I can slip through but they're much too small for you. Much too small for your kind. What's he doing? You have to remember. What do you think I'm trying to do? Tell us your name. Type your name in. What about this? I don't know what this is. It's like I'm looking at a stranger. Do you remember this? No, I don't remember any of this. Christ above. I don't remember any of it. Have you been there? - I'm feeling... - What is it? Images. It might be somewhere I used to go. It's dark, they played strange music. Thumping music, banging like a heartbeat in my head. It seems like I went there a few times. It was all new to me. Don't look at him. He seems familiar to me. Don't look at him please. Here. These. Look at these. The club. The night club. There has to be more. What do you want? Here, this, do you remember? I went to the club. Help, help, please. Please somebody help me. Please. Pretty, pretty please help me. Please help. Somebody help me. Help me, please, please. Can you hear me? Please can you hear me, somebody? No, stop, stop, get away! Don't touch me, don't touch me. No, get away from me. Leave me alone, stop! Stop, don't touch me, stop! Stop! Stop, don't touch me! What happened? She stopped. You just kept screaming. How long was I screaming? Forever. I'm really scared. It's okay. It's okay. Come on. I need to lie down. But no screaming. - I don't like when you scream. - Me neither. - Are you okay? - I'm a little lightheaded. You should try to sleep. Will you hold me? - Will they be back? - I don't know. Are we safe? What have you done to me? Talk to me, God damn it. What do you want? The Lord said "because the cry of sodom and gomorrah "is great, because their sin is very grievous, "I will go down now and see whether they have done "altogether according to the cry of it "which has come unto me and if not I will know." Answer me, why am I tied up? Look at me, for Christ's sake. Please tell me what's going on. You need to hush yourself, wanton whore. Do you know me? Do you know my name? A jezebel by any other name would smell as foul. You must know me, right? You need to hush yourself, sinner. Just lie back there and enjoy the show. What are you talking about? Be silent, strumpet. Hush and enjoy the show. What show? Ladies, if there are any, and gentlemen, I certainly hope not, welcome to our show. The only local establishment catering to all of your woes. Now, don't be surprised if the sun never rises and the masquerade ball never ends. Darkened twilight is our final encore. Life, my friends, you shall never see again. Remove all your fears. This room is your cell forever to wander between heaven and... No, I don't want to see this. How are you doing? How does it look like I'm doing? Can you untie me? - You're tied up? - Yeah. - You could say that. - But you can't be tied up. Why would you want to do a thing like that? He's doing it, they're doing it. - Who? - That guy, him. - But there isn't anyone here. - They're all around us. He's behind you and the others are over there. There's no one behind me. Because you can't see them. The music, you hear the music, right? There isn't any music playing. Please don't say that. They were playing at this night club. I hear nothing. And now, the moment you've all been waiting for. I know you can hardly contain yourselves. The wait is over for all you pussy loving prevailers of perverted spectacle. Deep from the darkest pits of desire. Aren't you going to talk to me? From pleasure born of searing pain. - Can't you hear them? - Who? I give you, master and servant. ♪ Misconceptions ♪ Make them stop, you have to make them stop. - Who? - Please, I can't watch this. You're getting off on this, aren't you? Look at you, you're practically slipping that bed into a putrid puddle of love juice. I knew you were a dirty whore. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? This has something to do with the club, the club on the flyer. Answer me. You should watch this, girl, you might learn something. Watch. ♪ A sort of misconceptions ♪ ♪ Misconceptions ♪ Watch. No! Make them go away. Speak, say something. Who they? Why? Is that it? I don't know. Why here? I don't know why I'm here. Why they here? I don't fucking know. You know them. I've never seen them before. Not a question, you know them. I know them. I wouldn't. You gotta make it stop. Think. It could us help. It could what? Stop, that hurts her! Stop. You're hurting me. Stop, it hurts. They can't hurt you if you don't let them. How did you do that? Do what? Make them go away. Who? The bad people. Were they here? I didn't see them. When did you come in? Just now, you were asleep at the table but I thought I should wake you up. I was really scared. What are you scared of? The same thing as you, the bad people. You won't let them hurt me, will you? No. I won't let them hurt you. He frightens me. Have you met others here? - In other rooms? - Some. But they're not nice. They scream a lot and they don't like to talk. - It's the man. - Can I let him in? He's here. - How did you do that? - I didn't. You did. - I did? - Yeah. You let me in. I don't know how you did it. One minute I was knocking on the door and then suddenly, I'm here. You're speaking. I seem to have found my voice. - Who's he? - We don't know. He's not talking much. He seems familiar. - Like an old friend. - And who are you? We're in the same predicament. Do you know who I am? - Sorry. - I think if we can figure out who one of us is, well then all three would stand a good chance at getting out of here. - Where do we start? - What do you remember? - I keep having these flashes. - Quick, little flashes - of memory. - Yeah, exactly but I can't figure out what they are. - What do you see? - A room. - Like this one? - No, different, - like a bedroom. - Your room? I don't think so. It doesn't seem like it would be my room. - I remember my bedroom. - You do? It had a tree right outside the window and pink curtains and dolls, lots of dolls and a dollhouse my grandpa built me. That sounds beautiful. Do you remember your room? Lots of wood, wooden furniture, old, antique and a four poster bed with amber light shades. I can't remember mine. Why can't I see it? - I recognize you. - You do? Yes. Have we met before? We might have. Are you sure that you don't know me? There's something about you, I guess we could've met somewhere. Do you remember that vile man? Who are you calling vile? The truth is never vile. - I didn't mean... - Why don't you shut that dirty mouth of yours before I shut it for you? - Where'd the other one go? - Who? Old scratch, why? You want him to give you a little scratch in the old joy trail? Play a tasty tune on his skin flute? Why do you keep talking to her like that? It's not nice to talk like that; it's dirty. It's wrong. You're just like her, you just don't know it yet. Old enough to bleed, old enough to breed. Stop it! - Just stop it. - I can't stop it. You brought this on yourselves, sinners you are, all of you, the whole lot of you and of that there isn't any doubt. How do you know I'm a sinner? That means you'd have to know me somehow, - isn't that right, old man? - She has a point. There is no point, look at her. You can tell she's an open late strumpet who's had more cock than a whole barnyard full of roosters. Stop talking like that in front of the girl! What girl? - What did you do to her? - Do to her? You are the sinner, child. God's smiting you and those you love. Can't you see it, slut? Mine eyes have seen the coming of the Lord. Open those eyes for once, hussy, instead of that sperm soiled crack of yours. Just because she's a woman doesn't make her a slut. Of course it does. The first woman was a trollop and I'm not talking about Eve, I'm talking about Lilith, the real first woman. Wagging her tail just itching for some bulldog's cock - to be up inside her. - You're wrong. - What if he's not? - What are you talking about? Sex is a sin. I seem to feel like that sometimes. Sex is only a sin if we believe it's a sin. It's only considered wrong because someone's shamed us into thinking that. Look at her, you can see it in her eyes. The bigger, the better, eh, strumpet? She likes getting a stiff one up inside her. Just like that one. See? Look at her. It makes her panties all dripping wet. If she had no legs, she'd practically be a slut. You're a filthy bastard. I'm not the one breaking God's commandments. Everything that's going on here with people appearing and disappearing, none of this can be real. It can't be real. - Maybe you're in hell. - We're not in hell. You're fascinated with them, aren't you? How come they just do this in front of us and be okay with it? - Sex is natural. - It's an abomination - against God. - It's human. It has to be, doesn't it? How do you know what they're doing is moral? What does this tell you? And what does this tell you? What if I say it's okay, but it's not? That's the point, isn't it? We're a blank slate right now. No parents, no friends, nobody to tell us what to believe. We're like children. No judgements, no bitterness, no regrets. She must abide by the laws of our maker. She's a slut, a sinner. Have you ever listened to yourself, hmm? Have you taken a good, hard look at yourself? Because I think you should read that book of yours and then you might learn something about love, affection, and forgiveness. What is it? I don't know. - Make it stop. - I can't. I don't know who it is. - I can't take this! - Tell me who it is. It's time to get up. Go away! Time to wake up. There we are. All wakey wakey. I've cooked you some dinner. You've got to keep up your strength. You've got to be strong. What did you put on it? - Nothing. - You were sprinkling something on it. That? Seasoning, salt. You said you liked things salty. - I did? - Mm-hmm. Stop that. Don't eat like a pig, don't eat so fast. Are you a pig? Are you a pig? No. Then slow down. Who are you? Why do you play these games with me? We have been together for so long. So we know each other. Know each other? We, my dear, love each other. Love? Of course. You love me, I love you. K-I-S-S-I-N-G. You know, we really have to change the decor around here. It just doesn't have that certain je ne sais quoi. - How did you do that? - Do what? - Make everything change. - Nothing's changed. Same old room. Remember the time that we redecorated my bedroom? Nice memories. Yeah. - We had lots of them. - Yes, of course. We always had fun. We painted the walls here. We, you painted the walls. You didn't let me touch anything. You were so friendly then. Your husband, he came home. No. He was there. He's always there. I mean, not every second of every minute. Sometimes, it's just you and me. Now, tell me you love me. Tell me you love me. Tell me that you love me. I love you! - Not like that. - Please. Stop it, stop it. - With your tongue. - Please stop. With your tongue, that beautiful tongue. - Don't! - No! - My hand. - Don't play games with me. I don't like games. You are gonna show me that you love me with your tongue and you're gonna do it right now. - Make her stop. - Make who stop? Why do you make it so difficult, huh? Get her away from me. When you could be happy, you could relax and just enjoy it. I know. - We need to undress you. - No, don't. - Just let me eat. - Oh, you're gonna eat. - Oh, we're eating. - Yeah, you're gonna eat me. I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. Don't let her do this. There's no one here, it's just you and I. Stop being so difficult, poppet. You're very quiet today. Just lick me the way I like to be licked. Show me that you desire me. You do desire me, don't you? Don't you? Don't you? If you show me that you desire me and you make me feel good all over then maybe I will let you go home. Home. If you lick my clit nice, maybe I'll let you skip down the lane and see your family. You know my family? If you fuck me good, I'll let you go home, Dorothy. I'll let you click your heels and skip down the yellow brick road. I wanna go home. I wanna go back. He's home. He's home. Daddy's home, daddy's home. Where's my home? - I want my family. - He's here. Daddy's here. Ah, there you are. He's here, he's here. He's here, daddy's home. Daddy's here, he's here, he's here. He's here. Daddy's home. Please. No. Do something. Do something. I love when you please him this way, poppet. Make it stop. If I let you, it is because I love you that I let it happen. Pain, poppet. Love is never having to say you're sorry. Are you okay? It's all right, it's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you. - Where is he? - He's gone. You're safe now. - I'm in hell. - Are you hurt? Is she okay? I'm in hell. Who are you talking to? You're going to hell, you little fuck poppet. Go the fuck away. I'm not a bad person. - Am I a bad person? - No, of course you're not. But it's my fault. It's all my fault. How can it be your fault? Mom said kissing the boys was bad. You remember your mom? She had brown hair. She said kissing the boys would get me in trouble. She said thinking for myself would get me in trouble. She said I needed to grow up, get married, find a husband, settle down and do the right thing. Where's it coming from? I don't know. Who's laughing, where are they? - Are you sure about this? - I'm sure. I don't want to hurt you but they do say the pain can be pleasurable. I've talked with the other girls, I know it's going to hurt, but it's just part of it. - What about your parents? - I told you, they're gone all night. Stop worrying, it's okay. I want this. Can I undress you? You know who they are? I have no idea. - Think about it. - A clown. I don't know any clowns. What about you? - Maybe you know them. - Can't say that I do. Don't. You're too beautiful to hide. Are you cold? Scared? It'll be okay. What is it? I think I do know them. - Does it hurt? - A little. But it feels good too. Pain is pleasure. - Do you want me to... - No, no. Talk to me, who are they? - What's wrong? - It's nothing. - It's something. - No. Nothing. No, it can't be. Make them go away now. - Who is it? - Make them go away. Who is it? It's me. - None of this is real. - Yes it is. It can't be, there's no fucking way. How did I get here on the bed? - Tell me that. - But I exist. If none of this is real then I wouldn't exist. Nothing would. - Maybe you don't. - But I do. I can't explain it but maybe there's a good reason for us being here. Maybe it's staring us straight in the face. There's no way. I'm gonna prove to you this shit isn't real. I'm as real as you are. - I exist, therefore I am. - You're right. You say that she was you. The girl was me and the clown was him. - I lost my virginity to him. - To a man dressed as a clown? He was the class clown. I got scared but I wouldn't say so, he knew it and he tried to joke around a little to lighten the mood. And he did love me. If I'm not crazy, tell me how that happened. I don't know, but you are remembering. Maybe those two aren't real. Maybe they're just a part of our memory, or your memory. Somehow, someone's figured out a way to project our faults and memories. Like in a science fiction story. Perhaps I'm not the crazy one. Maybe you're insane and I'm your hallucination. Maybe but maybe not. What's all this stuff? So you just started at uni. No, she graduated. Look at this. Mum doesn't understand that I can't wait to get out the house. She's nagging me all the time, boys, boys, boys. Get married, have babies. She'd flip if she knew about the club. Don't stop, read more. I'm not really sure I should keep going to the club. It's not really what I thought I'd be into. I feel dirty like I'm doing something bad. They'll punish me. I don't know, but I can't help myself either. It's so fascinating, I wonder if I should try it out. No, stop reading. What? She's remembering something. What? What are you doing? Go on, it's okay. I remember the club. It's like one of those gothic clubs I think. No, that's not it. You went to a goth club, how exciting. What was it like? Dark, mysterious? No, it was like a gothic club but it wasn't. It was like a sex club, a swingers' club. Girls on poles and tables. Why would I go to a swingers' club? What else do you remember? They did these shows on Friday nights. - I started going to them. - What kind of shows? Bitter shows. And all these couples were there. You enjoyed it? I was curious, interested. I don't know why. Something about it turned me on. Pain and pleasure, like when you lost your virginity. Pain and pleasure. The one can't exist without the other. She always seemed to be enjoying it but I can't say that's what was turning me on. The whole show was sexual but they weren't actually having sex, they would just do that. That's it. That's what I wanted. I wanted to be with them. I wanted to be with a couple to find out what it would be like and then I met this husband and wife. - Who are they? - I don't remember their names. They were nice. I'd seen them around the club and I'd catch them watching me. You really shouldn't be talking about this. You shouldn't. It's all make believe, it's not real. It's not real, it's not real. - It is real. - No, it's not. Tell me more. I don't know how long I'd been going there but the couple finally came up and talked to me, polite, gentle. They read me like a book and they knew I wanted to experiment and they were looking for a woman to be with. They were friendly to me, kind. They told me I was beautiful and they wanted to take me - away for some weekend. - Stop it. Don't tell anymore lies. None of that happened, never ever. But I'm not lying. I'm remembering. You're making it up, you wouldn't go off and have sex with strangers. Don't do anything. Just keep talking. Now, tell me your story. After a few weeks of going to the club, I agreed to go away with them for the weekend. We met at the club because I didn't want my parents knowing anything about them. Why did you go with them? I wanted to find out what it would be like. - But why them? - They were married. They were family. They seemed safe enough that no one would know. La la la la la. Stop talking. None of this is happening. Yes, it is. - I'm a whore. - Why would you say that? I wanted to spend the weekend having sex. - That's what this is about. - You wanted to learn. It's your body. We left the club really late. What do you say we get out of here? Yeah, everybody's leaving. Do you still wanna come with us? We went and got some food then we drove to their place just as the sun was rising. It was a long drive. Do you remember where they live? No, I was nervous. I was lost in the anticipation of what was to come. When we got back to the house, we talked for a couple of hours. But I kept thinking about having sex with them. I was scared and I was rambling but they were being nice. Eventually we ran out of things to say. He finally broke the silence. So are we gonna do this or what? It's up to her. Hey. You do wanna do this, right? I wanna undress her. I'd prefer it if your wife did. Okay, fine, let her start. When I ran, this wasn't happening the way I thought it would. It was early in the morning and they were undressing me and there was nothing nice about it. - God, she's beautiful. - They're bigger than I thought. I just wanna touch her all over. I want her. Go slow. You'll both get your turn. You'll both get your turn, what the fuck was I saying? - You were scared. - Terrified. I didn't have the class clown to make me laugh. Hey, let's have a taste of our turn. Hey, you be a good little poppet for daddy. I saw you at the club tonight. You were watching the show, you liked it. You like it rough, don't you, deep down? You like it rough. Yes. That's what I thought. I didn't know what to do. I just wanted to go home. Why didn't you tell them to stop? You will do exactly as he says when he tells you to do it, - do you understand? - Yes. I wanted to believe this was part of the game. I knew I was in trouble. I didn't want to do this anymore, I just wanted to go home. Somebody take me home. Look at me. Look at me. You will only speak when spoken to and you will do exactly, I mean exactly, what I tell you to do. Do you understand? What's that? That is your new home. Get in the box. - No, please! - Hey! Did I say you could fucking speak? You stay in the box. They locked me in a box underneath their bed. They kept me caged there like I was an animal. Why are you crying? Please, don't cry. There's no reason to cry. Nothing bad is happening. Everything is good, pure, simple. - You have to keep going. - I can't. You must. It's the key. They locked me in a box. They locked me in a fucking box. No, they didn't. No one did anything to you. Stop denying it, you fucking freak. They kept me in a box and forced me to have sex with them. They raped me over and over like I was a goddamn sex slave. - No! - Stop! You have to see that everything is okay. Please don't do this. No. This can't be. How did this happen? No, this couldn't have happened. Not to you. Not to us. It can't be. I can see it all now. Everything that happened. Did you ever try to escape? You must've tried something to get away. When I was unbound, I was in the box. Everyday I prayed for death but death only came to tease me. I asked them to stop and they wouldn't. They laughed at me, spat on me, did everything you could imagine. I prayed I'd suffocate or they'd hit me too hard. Anything that would make it end. No matter how hard I prayed that they were going to release me. How long was I in the box? Tell me. Seven years. You were in the box for seven years. I wanna go home. I want this to end. She has to finish her story. - No, don't. - She has to. You have to remember. No, don't remember any of it. Don't say anything else. It can just be you and me together. It doesn't have to end for us. We could be happy. It can be us until the end. We can be together until the end. What's so funny? You did all this to yourself, remember? If you hadn't gone to that club, none of this would've happened. You're wrong. I didn't ask for this. - I didn't deserve it. - Doesn't matter. God knows how to punish the wicked. You wanted to be fucked. You wanted all that sin and now God is making you pay for it. I don't believe that. I'm a child of God. I had the right to be who I am, to be who he created - to be human. - Stop talking to him. You don't know what's going to happen. Whore. Stop! Don't judge others unless you judge yourself. God's words. Where's the splinter in your eye? Where is it? No. I'm done with you. It wasn't your fault, but it did happen, didn't it? When they took me, whatever innocence I had left died. What are you doing? Leave her alone. Help us. I'm sorry, I can't. It has to be done. No, no! No, no, help me. No. Help me please. Help me. End this. But I can't escape. Are you sure? Wait. I did escape. What do I do? - What am I supposed to do? - Stop fighting. Be a good, little poppet. We'll put you back in the box. I won't go in the box, you have to kill me first. You're already dead, you stupid bitch. No, I'm not, I'm not dead. You sure as hell will be. Remember this? Remember this, you bastards. You kept it in your drawer. Give it back to him. He didn't think I knew where it was but I saw it. I had to find a way to get the gun so I could kill myself and you. You stuck this gun in my face, in my mouth. You stuck it. Why didn't you just kill me? Pistol pussy whip. Kiss, kiss, spank me. We were just having some fun. You fucking raped me. Just taking what's ours. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. You killed my husband. Now I'm gonna tear your fucking heart out. Now you remember everything. They killed everything inside me. There was nothing left. They forgot to lock the box and I got out. I went to the gun, I was going to end it. I killed him then I shot her then... And then? I killed myself. I don't want to be here anymore. Please, let me go. I don't know if it's heaven or hell out there but I'm done hiding. I'm ready to leave. The woman remains alive this hour is by court ordered removal of life support systems. As we previously reported, the woman who police could only refer to as Jane Doe had been kidnapped and held captive for several years before escaping, killing her captives, turning the gun on herself in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. Doctors had been hopeful for her recovery when she first opened her eyes, but sadly she has since slipped back in her catatonic state that they fear she will never recover from. I'm sorry. I thought I had reached you in there. I thought that you could hear me. There's nothing more that I can do. Dr. Valentino, layover please. - Dr. Valentino. - Keep trying. You have to help me. You can't leave me here alone please. Forgive me. You can't leave me here alone. No, no, come back. Come back. Come back please. You can't leave me here like this. Come back, come back, please. You can't leave me here like this. Subtitles by explosiveskull
