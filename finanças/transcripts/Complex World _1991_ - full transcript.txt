I want to tell you about my twin brother little Ralph. Maybe you've heard of him (instrumental music) he's listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the youngest suicide in recorded history. It was a steamy July afternoon little Ralph grabbed a Luger pistol put the barrel to his head smiled at me and blew his brains all over the incubator (explosion) and all the while I was growing up my parents kept asking me the same question. Why can't you be more like your brother Ralph? - That's Morris Brock. Morris would do anything to become more famous than his twin brother Ralph. I found that out the hard way. My name is Jeff Burgess. I own a rock and roll Club called The Heartbreak Hotel I met Morris on the night he launched his career as a rock star (rock music) - "His brother got the headlines his brother got the girls he lived in Jesus shadow all his life" - Last night I found out about Morris's latest project (instrumental music) - Well I finally found a way to escape from little Ralph's shadow. I became a terrorist. (instrumental music) (gunshot sound) I joined an international consortium that was planning to raise the consciousness of 500 or so mindless bourgeois rock-and-rollers by blowing them up There were four of us. Gilda, our political officer, had grown up next door to Hitler she recruited me with promises of stranger European sex Harpo, our driver, was a weapons expert. Malcolm, our leader, was an asshole (singing) - Shut up! - I'm playing tonight I gotta practice - I haven't got the luxury of practice. One mistake now and a whole block goes up - This is the story of what happened last night at the Heartbreak Hotel and I guess it's also a story of how your family can mess up your life. Morris had to contend with his brother Ralph and I had my father to deal with - Hi, this is Clem Jefferson your public access Private Eye reporting from the Heartbreak Hotel that notorious nightclub owned by Jeff Burgess, son of presidential candidate Robert Burgess (rock music) - I had led a pretty wild life before I settled down at the Heartbreak Hotel Unfortunately I was still the son of the Honorable Robert Burgess, the United States Senator, former CIA director, presidential frontrunner and the last of the cold warriors. - Do you think there might be something unnatural about having my own son killed? - Oh come on Robert we've been through this - Maybe he's not my son he doesn't look like me and his mother was... did I ever tell you about her? - Is she the wife that killed herself? - According to the note she left she was trying to swim across the Atlantic Ocean (rock music) Just pull on it hard - It's incredible these people don't even lock their doors Where you going? I'm gonna go do my sound check (music continues) (instrumental music) I've got no support there zilch. Why should I suck up to them? - Sir, you must address the Black Caucus. If you don't they'll call you a racist - They already call me a racist - No sir they call you a fascist not a racist it's okay to be a fascist people like that. - Hello Richard - Holden and Miriam and I have something to discuss - 9:00 a.m. It's on your schedule - Your little package was delivered about 30 minutes ago - Any problems? - None. Fuck the black caucus. Tomorrow I'll be a national hero - The bomb in my basement wasn't the only problem. Our mayor wanted to tear down the Heartbreak Hotel to make room for a shopping mall. - Now don't get me wrong we are not against rock and roll I mean I like the Beatles and Dylan and the stones as well as the next guy so does the mayor, the mayor even plays guitar but that is not what we're talking about here. What's the expression sex and drugs and rock and roll we are talking about sex and drugs we are talking about the blatant sex and promiscuous use of illegal drugs that permeates that establishment and which threatens the moral fiber of our young people (rock music) - Tell me who that is and I'll do the job for nothing I gotta get killed by the Indians custer custom my ass that's Thomas Jonathan Jackson the greatest combat general in American history and you're educated you don't know shit - I know there's a thousand dollars in here there's a thousand more when the job's done - What do you need me for? Why don't you go ahead and raid the place? - A police raid wouldn't be enough to shut it down permanently so we need a riot then we can move the cops in and really nail 'em. Do we have a deal? -There's Jackson, standing there like a stonewall (singing) - this is Reverend Tillman Gandhi jr. who preaches from this corner just a block from the Heartbreak Hotel. Reverend Gandhi do you think there's any spiritual quality at all to the Heartbreak Hotel? - Clem there is an evil spiritual quality yes the same kind of spiritual quality that the Philistines had - Philistines? - Yes I have never been inside but when I walk past and look in there I see nothing but Philistines in there - My companions were not exactly state-of-the-art terrorists If they screwed up I was poised to take control - There's 100 pounds of plastique sittin under the dance floor - Where is he? - At the club that's doing a sound test - We should eliminate him now - We need the little asshole tonight - I do not like this ransom business we should proceed as soon as the club fills up - What you like or dislike is none of my concern did you make the tape? (on tape) Last night a blow was struck for the oppressed peoples of the world. We have brought the struggle to the home ground of the oppressor America can no longer escape from the outrage of the masses. The destruction of the Great Satan has begun. We chose first strike at the rotting underbelly of this disease society at a dirty decadent little bourgeois music club owned by a son of the fascist Pig robots they're just who knows where we will strike next Sweet dreams, America (Singing and playing guitar) and the dead guy's arms are falling off and the dead guy's face is blue and the dead guys smells like someone's dirty feet - God is going to smite the people in Heartbreak Hotel's into fudge caramel and will run all down all over the place and then he'll put hemorrhoids in their anus - Hemorrhoids where? - In their anus, rectum (Instrumental music) (Motorcycle sounds) (Rock music) - You're probably gonna get a lot of calls tonight about disturbances at the Heartbreak Hotel. No, more than usual. I want you to ignore them until you get a call from me. Yes, don't worry about it, it's what the mayor wants (crowd cheering) - The young adults were the main act that night. I was opening for them. That was like having Mozart open for Wayne Newton - You know the Americans had some pretty tight security when they were making the atomic bomb but the Germans and Russians couldn't figured out where they were making it. All they had to do is look at the circulation records in galaxy magazine because a circulation change from Chicago to Tennessee to New Mexico for the Russians and Germans have to do to figure out where the Americans are making the bomb was check the circulation in galaxy magazine (singing) - Hey is this your motorcycle? Can I take it for a ride? Where are the keys how do you start it? (laughter) How fast will this go? I wanna pass some cops (laughter) - Do you know what a Philistine carries in his pouch? - Excuse me? - You know what a Philistine carries in his pouch? - No, I, I don't - Camel's dung How does a Philistine count to 25? On both hands. Did you know that Goliath is 9 feet tall and 9 is an insignificant number of the devil. Let me tell you how - Reverend Andy - Yes - Thank you - I headed back to headquarters for the last supper with my Terror colleagues (Instrumental music) - You must have heard of them. You know, Guy Fawkes Day November 5th 1605 He was a terrorist like us. Tried to blow up the Parliament building with gunpowder. He got caught they tortured him then they hung him - Alright let's go over this. Anything unusual behind the bar at the front door particularly new faces, you report it to Gilda. Never lose contact with her - Where are you gonna be? - That is none of your concern - How come she gets to know and I don't? - We all know precisely what we need to know. Anything unusual you report it to Gilda - Reynolds may be a flaming liberal but he's no dope. He won't be easy to fool - Don't worry I can handle myself - I hope so All right you come back in here after the call. You're preoccupied, shaken, you tell Reynolds that something has come up and you can't complete the interview but then and this is the tricky part you change your mind because you need to talk to someone. So you confide in Reynolds off-the-record, you lay the whole thing out for him. You tell him that terrorists have planted a bomb in your son's nightclub. They want a million dollar ransom but instead you propose a commando raid. Well of course the bleeding hearts won't follow your advice and we'll try and negotiate and when the bomb explodes on schedule at 1:00 a.m. you come out the tragic hero willing to stand up to terrorism even at the expense of your son's life - And I'll have a pinko reporter in place to verify it all - You know Gilda I sing much better if I have a sexual release right before I go onstage - All right on the count of three I shoot off your scrub One, two... I like rough sex but if things went sour at the club that night I didn't want to get caught with a hole in my underwear (up beat music) - I don't have the luxury of practice - All sorts of people came to the Heartbreak Hotel they showed up for the music, for the atmosphere, sometimes I got the feeling that they were looking for something more but I could never figure out if they found it - Hey where's my beer - Hey that's my beer! - I go to the can for a minute my beer is gone Hey you, you took my beer. I had a full one right here I want another one right here right now - I didn't take your beer - Right here and right now - Fuck you - Fuck me? I'm a paying customer you say that to me I want to see the manager - Excuse me? - What's that drink called? - Oh it's a Harvey Wallbanger - Vodka, orange juice, with the Galliano on top - Why is it called a Harvey Wallbanger? - Gee I don't know maybe it was named after the guy who invented it - Here's the opening act folks, Morris Bravo (Fart noise) - Does anybody here know where syphilis came from? - Your mother! - What's the capital of New Mexico? - Your mother! (laughter) - You know what's wrong with you people you're ignorant you don't know anything. I can't stand ignorance, it makes me angry There's hope for all of you yet you're all gonna die... someday. Death makes you smart You can take a complete idiot and kill him or her and then he knows more than the smartest person alive. He knows what death is. So don't worry help is on the way (Singing) I hear that we're caught in a major food crisis famine is knocking at the world's front door still we're wasting protein on women and nobody knows what we're doing it for why do we feed the broads please tell me why do we feed the broads we could feed the whole damn world if we didn't have to feed the broads - You were wild, busting up the town Remember that? It was great You got old. You join the mop. You know, he had respect If he had kept riding, he just would have been some fat old guy in a t-shirt on a bike - What? -Make it simple for him - Look what he's trying to say is there's nothing more pathetic than an old guy in a bike - I'm not pathetic - Not you, him - In war you kill people in order to change their minds. Remember that it's fucking a pardon - And the Lord God looked down upon the face of the earth and behold anguish and trouble and the Lord God said there's nothing down here but burglars rapists murderers drug pushers pimps gamblers. Noah build me an ark Yes lord how do you want it done Lord? Build it in the fashion that I tell you make it as long as a football field. Got it Make it three stories tall-got it, anything else Lord? Yeah yeah I want you to gather all the animals of the earth and two by two and bring them and put them into this Ark Will do, Lord (phone ringing) - Look we paid 10 bucks to get in here can we have a couple beers - Look, I'll serve you, not him - Why not - Look at him he's shitfaced - He's fine - I'm fine! - He's just a little dizzy - Yeah, dizzy - It's his birthday - Heartbreak Hotel - I wish to speak with Mr. Burgess please - Speaking - Listen carefully Burgess There's a very powerful bomb containing plastique explosive hidden in your cellar now it's set to go off at 1:00 a.m. but can be detonated at any time by remote device in my possession if there's a mass exodus from the club or we detect any indication of police action we shall detonate the bomb at once - Tell you what I'll let you have a beer if you drink it out of this - I'll take it - I what to dedicate this next song to a certain special someone in the audience tonight. You know who you are The song is about my favorite European dictator before you (Singing) (Audience booing) (Phone ringing) - Heartbreak Hotel - I assure you this is not a prank Burgess I am deadly serious -You know I really can't be taking threats over the phone come on down here threaten me in person - All the animals came into the ark by pairs except for the worms they came in apples (laughs) now here comes the rain and here comes the Senators knocking on the door Hey Noah let us in sorry I can't let you in come on it's me Thomas Richards yeah open their doors Peter Rogers see the Lord has taken away all evil from me, you're no good.

Well let me put it this way we live in perilous times what with the communist conspiracy powder keg situation in the Middle East breakdown of traditional values at home we need a man of strength, experience, and character that can meet these problems head-on - There is a bomb planted at the Heartbreak Hotel now that bomb will go off unless I am paid 1 million dollars by 1 AM - Are you the guy with the cherry bombs? - Cherry bombs?
