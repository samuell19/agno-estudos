YOU ARRIVE HERE FROM WHERE, KANSAS? HOW'D YOU KNOW? FIGURES. WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE THINK THIS IS-- A THEME PARK? BEN, PLEASE. I GOT THE "TORSO IN THE DUMPSTER" SPEECH FROM GUS. POINT IS, YOU DON'T COME TO A CITY LIKE THIS WITHOUT KNOWING ANYBODY. I DO KNOW SOMEBODY. REALLY? YOU KNOW SOMEBODY HERE IN THE CITY, BECAUSE YOU PREFER TO SLEEP IN THE PARK. IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT. I'LL BET. LOOK. I'M SORRY. IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS. HERE. THIS KIND OF FITS. THIS PERSON AND I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY MET. I SAID IT WAS COMPLICATED. YOU'RE RIGHT.

YOUR TASTE IS PICKING UP, GUS. SHE JUST WALKED IN HERE. WE HAD A SIGN. A SIGN. OH, JESUS... YOU JUST LAID EYES ON HER. I CAN'T BE PUTTING OUT A NEW SIGN EVERY DAY. CAREFUL THERE. THAT'S YOUR EMPLOYER. THAT WOMAN OWNS THE PLACE? AND THE BUILDING. SO SHE'S ALSO YOUR LANDLADY? PART OF MY COMPENSATION. SHE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO'D EAT IN A PLACE LIKE THIS, MUCH LESS OWN IT. YEAH? WHAT DOES SHE LOOK LIKE, YOU THINK? SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T REACT WELL TO AN OVERCOOKED OMELET. HERE YOU GO. SO HOW DID SHE GET THIS PLACE? PROBABLY A GIFT FROM A GRATEFUL JOHN. SHE'S A PROSTITUTE? SHE RUNS AN ESCORT SERVICE. YOU MEAN SHE'S A HIGH-CLASS PIMP? THAT'S A RATHER PEJORATIVE WAY OF DESCRIBING WHAT SHE DOES, BUT... YES, IN AN EXOTIC SORT OF WAY, THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES, AND THAT'S PROBABLY HOW SHE HERSELF WOULD DESCRIBE IT. MARGARET WANTS TO TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE. BE NICE. SHE'S THE BOSS. SO I GATHER. I DON'T...MEN FOR MONEY. WOMEN, EITHER, FOR THAT MATTER. NEITHER DO I, HONEY. AT LEAST NOT ANYMORE. MM-HMM.

IT'S JUST PRETTY CLOSE TO THE JOB ORIGINALLY OFFERED. WHICH YOU TURNED DOWN? WHAT DO YOU THINK? WELL, IT'S A LOT MORE PROSAIC THAN SELLING MY BOD. YEAH? WHAT? LAW SCHOOL. I GO TO LAW SCHOOL AT NIGHT. OH, IT'S WORSE, THEN, ISN'T IT? BODY AND SOUL. YOU DON'T LIKE LAWYERS, EITHER? JESUS, NOBODY LIKES LAWYERS. NOT EVEN OTHER LAWYERS. YOU'RE ALL OF WHAT, 18? YOU ALREADY KNOW EVERYTHING. SO HOW'D YOU GET TO BE SUCH A SMART-...? IT WASN'T EASY. I CAN IMAGINE. [SIGH] SO THAT'S YOUR DREAM, THEN? TO BECOME A LAWYER? AT THIS STAGE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT. IT'S HARDLY A DREAM. AH. YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO WATCH THIS. I SLEEP IN MY SKIVVIES. EW! TIGHTY WHITIES? YOU DON'T LIKE MY JOCKEY SHORTS, EITHER? I LIKE THEM SO LONG AS YOU KEEP THEM AND YOUR STUFF IN YOUR OWN BED.

WOMAN'S HUNGRY. HAVE A SEAT. KEEP ME COMPANY WHILE I EAT. EASY. OH, RIGHT. TAKEOUT, ONLY. IT'S AN ESCORT SERVICE. THAT'S NOT QUITE WHAT I'M RUNNING HERE, NOT IN THE NORMAL SENSE OF THAT TERM. REALLY? AS IN A TRADITIONAL MODE, WE HAVE THE CUSTOMER AND THE SERVICE PROVIDER, BUT IN MY SERVICE, BOTH HAVE THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE. SOUNDS LIKE A TRICKY WAY OF NOT CALLING IT "PROSTITUTION." IT IS IN FACT A SYSTEM I ARRIVED AT OUT OF DEEPCONVICTIONCPNVICTION. [MUSIC PLAYING] DO YOU KNOW HOW TO OPERATE THAT THING? AND THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENS? GIRLS TELL TRICKS TO GET LOST? ABSOLUTELY. WELL, I GUESS YOU'RE MAKING A BUCK AROUND HERE, SO... MAYBE IT ISN'T TOTALLY NUTS. PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO SEE YOUR ROOM. MY WHAT? IT GOES WITH THE JOB. WHAT JOB? IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK. MY ASSISTANT, MY SECRETARY. MAJORDOMO. WHATEVER I CAN'T GET TO AND YOU'VE LEARNED HOW TO DO BECAUSE I'VE TAUGHT YOU. EXCEPT FOR THE DAMN COMPUTER, WHICH YOU'LL TEACH ME.

YOU MEAN GRADES? THEY FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY TO MEASURE IT? I'M DOING REASONABLY WELL GIVEN MY BASIC UNFAMILIARITY WITH THE COURSE MATERIAL. WINGING IT, HUH? YOU MIGHT SAY. WHAT ABOUT YOU? SHE WANTS ME TO COME WORK FOR HER AND LIVE IN HER APARTMENT. CONGRATULATIONS. AND TO WHAT DO YOU OWE THE SPEEDY PROMOTION? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? I'M ABOUT TO BECOME A HOOKER? WHY WOULD I THINK THAT? THE PROPRIETRESS OF ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FLOATING WHOREHOUSES IN THE CITY OFFERS YOU A JOB AFTER SEEING YOU ONLY ONCE. WHERE'S THE CONNECTION? WELL, YOU'RE WRONG. THE JOB IS TO BE HER ASSISTANT. THE JOB YOU PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED AS BEING A PIMP. WELL...IT'S NOT AS IF I HAVE SO MANY OPTIONS RIGHT NOW. IT'S ILLEGAL. IT SHOULDN'T BE. YOU RUN FOR OFFICE AND CHANGE THE LAW, RIGHT? YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A BIG...HELP. HOW ELSE AM I SUPPOSED TO FIND A PLACE TO LIVE IN THIS...CITY? EASY. STAY WITH ME. OH. RIGHT. IF I START PUTTING OUT.

HOW'D YOU GET TO BE THIS WAY? WHY DO I KEEP GETTING ASKED THAT? BECAUSE YOU'RE A PAIN IN THE ... SO YOU'RE NOT ASKING ME ON A DATE? NO. BUSINESS MEAL-- THAT'S THE OFFER. TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. I ACCEPT. SO... WHY'D YOU LEAVE KANSAS? DOROTHY. WHAT? THE QUOTE IS, "WHY DID YOU LEAVE KANSAS, DOROTHY?" OK. WELL... FIRST, YOUR STEPFATHER GETS YOU TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH ALL THE OLD PEOPLE IN THE TRAILER PARK. AND THEN HE MAKES YOU WRITE DOWN THE NAMES OF ALL THEIR PRESCRIPTION PAINKILLERS. AND YOU DO IT... BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID. AND THEN HE GOES IN THERE AND HE STEALS THE ONE CALLED OXYCODONE, WHICH HE CRUSHES UP SO THE TIME RELEASES WON'T GIVE HIM AWAY. THEN HE AND YOUR MOTHER FIGHT OVER THE POWDER LIKE DOGS UNTIL IT'S ALL UP THEIR NOSES, AND BINGO, WHAT DO YOU KNOW? STRONG AS HEROIN. SHE USED TO SING, BUT SHE THREW THAT AWAY.. WITH EVERYTHING ELSE. GOT OUT WHEN YOU COULD. I LEFT HER. WHAT I NEED TO DO NOW IS MAKE IT HERE. LIKE THE SAYING GOES, MAKE IT HERE, MAKE IT ANYWHERE, RIGHT? SO THAT'S YOUR DREAM? YOU'RE A SINGER, TOO. I'VE HEARD YOU IN THE SHOWER. OH, JESUS, NO, I HAVE NO VOICE. I JUST WRITE 'EM. WHY IS EVERYBODY BEING SO NICE TO ME? MARGARET, GUS, EVEN YOU, BEN. PROBABLY SOME SIGNS TO A CONSPIRACY. OH, RIGHT. YOU'RE ALL GONNA PUT ME IN SOME SNUFF FILM. I CAN SEE IT NOW. TORSO IN THE DUMPSTER. MWAH! HA HA HA! I KNEW IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. [CHUCKLES] WHAT? NOTHING. Woman on machine: YOU HAVE ONE NEW MESSAGE AND 7 OLD MESSAGES. Man: HEY, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE, BUT YOU GOT TO STOP CALLING ME, OK? JUST STOP DIALING MY NUMBER. BYE. Woman: MONDAY, 7:23 A.M. END OF MESSAGES. [BEEP] I CROSS THEM OFF WHEN I GET A DEFINITIVE ANSWER. IS THAT FROM MY PHONE BOOK? WHO DO YOU NEED TO LOOK UP IN HURLEY THROUGH HUTNER? A PERSON YOU KNOW HERE BUT YOU'VE NEVER MET. MY DAD. A GUY... FROM NEW YORK... NAMED HUTCH. THAT'S WHAT I'VE GOT. SEEMS HE WAS JUST PASSING THROUGH-- THE STATE OF KANSAS AND MY MOM. CAN'T EVEN BE SURE HE GAVE HER THE RIGHT NAME OR NICKNAME. SO YOU'RE CALLING EVERY HUTCHINS AND HUTCHINSON IN THE BOOK. HI THERE. I WAS WONDERING IF I MIGHT HAVE A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME FOR A POLL I'M TAKING. DID YOU EVER...A WOMAN IN KANSAS, SAY, ABOUT 19 YEARS AGO? THERE ARE OTHER APPROACHES. AND I'M TRYING THEM, BUT THEY'RE ALL PRETTY PAINFUL. LOOK. I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE FACTS, BUT THIS MAY NOT BE THE TYPE OF GUY YOU NECESSARILY WANT TO FIND. BUT I'M NEVER GONNA KNOW, AM I? UNLESS I FIND HIM. ALL YOURS. [TOILET FLUSHING] SO, UH... IT'S GOOD NIGHT, THEN? IT SURE HAS BEEN. SEE? WHAT'S THAT, BEN? JUST FRIENDS, NO PROBLEM. IT'S EASY, RIGHT? SURE AS HELL IS. A MONTH, MR. MANCUSO. I'VE BEEN HERE A MONTH. YES, IT SEEMS LONGER TO ME, TOO, SIR. YES, BUT IT'S JUST THE ONE POLICY THAT MARGARET SIMPLY WILL NOT CHANGE. JUST LIKE YOU, THE GIRLS ARE FREE TO CHOOSE. [DING] YES. BUT WHEN THEY DO DECIDE TO STAY WITH YOU, THEN YOU KNOW THEY REALLY LIKE YOU. YOU CAN REFER TO THEM AS...IF YOU LIKE, SIR, BUT THEY ARE IN FACT ACTUAL PEOPLE. AND YOU THINK THAT'S MISOGYNY. WENDY, WHAT'S UP? YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE PAPERS? NO. WHERE'S MARGARET? JOGGING. WHAT'S GOING ON? HE'S YOURS? THE FOOT FREAK. THIS BILLIONAIRE IS THE FOOT FREAK? HE JUST SUCKS AWAY, HONEY, LIKE ANY OTHER TRICK, JUST NOT ON MY WINKY. I THOUGHT HALF YOUR TRICKS DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU HAD A...WINKY. WELL, THIS ONE KNOWS, ALTHOUGH THE CHARM FOR HIM IS TO PRETEND HE'S SURPRISED TO FIND OUT, YOU KNOW, AS IF IN THE THROES OF PASSION, AS IF HE'S TOO FAR GONE ON MY TOES TO CARE WHAT LIES NORTHWARD. WE DO A LOT OF "AS IF"ing IN WENDY'S SCHOOL. AND YOU DID THIS? YOU CLOCKED HIM? WITH WHAT? A LOCK IN A SOCK. YOU'RE LUCKY YOU DIDN'T KILL THE SON OF A... WHAT'S A POOR GIRL TO DO? MUST BE, WHAT, 10 OR 12 KIDS BORN EVERY YEAR IN THE WORLD HARBORING THIS COMBINATION OF BRILLIANCE AND INDIFFERENCE? YOU THINK I'M INDIFFERENT TO LAW SCHOOL? ATTENDING HALF OF YOUR CLASSES MIGHT GIVE RISE TO THAT INFERENCE. WHY ARE YOU HERE, BENJAMIN? JUST TO GET A DIPLOMA SO YOU CAN GO OUT AND MAKE MONEY? I--I ASSUME YOUR PREFERENCE WOULD RUN TOWARDS AN HONEST ANSWER. DECIDEDLY. I'M HERE BECAUSE I COULDN'T THINK OF A BETTER THING TO DO. SOME ADVICE? I'M OPEN TO ADVICE. GOOD. TRY TAKING IT SERIOUSLY. DO SOMETHING-- A PRO BONO CASE, SOMETHING THAT IS SERIOUS. DON'T DRIFT. DISCOVER YOURSELF, NOW. OK? I'LL LOOK AROUND FOR IT. YOU DO THAT. OH, AND, BEN, HOW'S MARGARET? SHE'S GOOD. FORMIDABLE WOMAN, MARGARET. YES. HAVE YOU EVER TOLD ME HOW YOU TWO MET?

GAMES. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, MR. STERNLICHT? HAVE HER HURT. WHAT? I THINK YOU HEARD ME. I KNOW THE PEOPLE PROTECTING YOU. THEY'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO. INCAPACITATE WENDY, SHE'LL HAVE NO PLACE TO GO BUT THE PRESS-- THE PART YOU DON'T OWN. SO WHAT? PEOPLE ALREADY HATE ME-- SO MUCH, IT'S ALMOST TURNED TO ADMIRATION. HEH HEH HEH! AND IF I DON'T DO THIS? IT'S GOING TO GET DONE, MARGARET, WHETHER YOU DO IT OR YOU PUT ME TO THE TROUBLE OF DOING IT MYSELF. BUT IF YOU DO IT, I WON'T CLOSE YOU DOWN OR SEND YOU TO PRISON. LEAVE THE REST OF YOUR PEOPLE ALONE. I COULD OFFER YOU OTHER COMPENSATION. [CHUCKLES] I DON'T THINK SO. YOU HAD TO BE THERE, MARGARET. WE DIDN'T NEED THIS, NOT NOW! OH, MY GOD. HER FROZEN FACE SYNDROME. THE THING IS, HE LIKES TO BE ABUSED BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE'S A... BUT THEN, WHEN YOU MAKE HIM SEE HOW UGLY OF A... HE REALLY IS, HE GOES BALLISTIC.

IF ONLY YOU HAD FELT YOUR SPECIES ENDANGERED BY A LESS POWERFUL MAN. OH. THANK YOU, DEAR. YOU READ MY MIND. LOOK AT YOU. YEAH? WHAT? PRETTY FINE. YOU THINK? YOU'LL DO. WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE? DAMAGE CONTROL. YOU READ ABOUT THIS GUY STERNLICHT? "MOGUL MUGGED"? YEAH. ONLY, HE WASN'T MUGGED. HE WAS LAID OUT BY ONE OF OURS. STERNLICHT USES AN ESCORT SERVICE? I'LL BE DAMNED.

STERNLICHT WANTS WENDY TO PAY. IF MARGARET DOESN'T GET IT DONE FIRST, HE'S GONNA SHUT HER DOWN. AND TAKE CARE OF ME HIMSELF. WHAT DOES MARGARET THINK OF THIS PLAN? SHE'LL BE HAPPY WHEN WE PULL IT OFF. YOU KNOW WHAT STERNLICHT'S MIDDLE INITIALS ARE? "V.V." HIS CLOSEST FRIENDS SAY IT STANDS FOR "VIOLENT" AND "VINDICTIVE." IF YOU GET CAUGHT-- WHICH WE WON'T. HE'LL GO AFTER MARGARET AND ANYBODY CLOSE TO HER. I'VE ALREADY BOOKED A LITTLE CABANA IN THE YUCATAN. MARGARET FOUND IT ONLINE. WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHAT ABOUT ME? ANYWAY, WHERE WAS I?

AND THEN MY WIFE AND MY MOTHER-IN-LAW, WHO I AM SUPPORTING IN OUTER MONGOLIA, THEY COME HERE, MAKE MY LIFE A LIVING HELL. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? SAM. MY NAME IS SAM. THERE'S NO OUTER MONGOLIA, SAM. INNER, YES; OUTER, NO. SO MAYBE HE JUST SHOOTS THE MESSENGER. STAY OF EXECUTION. SAYS ANY RESTAURANT OF MY CHOICE. FINE. MAKE A RESERVATION AT THE SAN DOMENICO AND PICK ME UP HERE AT 1:30. Man: MR. STERNLICHT. YOU HONOR US, SIR. RIGHT THIS WAY. REMEMBER ME? I HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY HAD THE PLEASURE, MADAM. ARE YOU SURE? OH, OF COURSE. WHO COULD FORGET SUCH CLASSIC AND IMPECCABLE BREEDING? IN 36 DAYS, ONE FORGETS PLENTY. 36 DAYS AGO. LET ME THINK. AH, A YOUNG WOMAN OF APPROXIMATELY YOUR AGE APPLIED FOR A JOB. I THOUGHT HER VASTLY OVERQUALIFIED. SINCE THEN, I HAVE LEARNED, GRATIFYINGLY SO, THAT MY JUDGMENT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED. HMM. TALK ABOUT OVERQUALIFICATIONS. YOU OUGHT TO BE THE ... MAYOR. MMM. [CHUCKLING] ARE YOU SATISFIED? I ASSUME THAT'S WHY YOU PICKED THIS RESTAURANT. I'M NOT SATISFIED. I WANT TO SEE SOME SERIOUS ...-KISSING HERE, NOT JUST EXHIBITIONS OF DIPLOMACY. I EXPECT YOU TO HAVE THEM JUMPING THROUGH HOOPS. GO ON. SNAP YOUR FINGERS AND MAKE THEM JUMP. IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. NO? HOW DOES IT WORK? HOW DO YOU TURN THEM INTO SLIPPERY WORMS? BY NEGOTIATION... EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. IT'S THE WAY TO DO ANYTHING SUCCESSFULLY... WITH OTHER PEOPLE. THE '88, PLEASE. AND INTO WHAT SLITHERY STATE DO YOU WISH TO NEGOTIATE ME? THE OPPOSITE, ACTUALLY. I LIKE YOUR AUDACITY. I'M INTRIGUED BY WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT YOU. AND DESPITE THE CIRCUMSTANCES BRINGING US TOGETHER, I SENSE SOMETHING RESPONSIVE TO ME IN YOU. COULD YOU EXPAND ON THAT, PLEASE? HA HA HA! YOU WISH TO TRIVIALIZE? YOU THINK I'D WANT TO LOOK SUCH A TRADE IN THE FACE WITHOUT TRIVIALIZING IT BEFOREHAND? EVERYONE HAS SUCH TRAITS, DESIRES, IMPULSES-- DARK IMPULSES-- MATTERS FEW PEOPLE WISH TO ACKNOWLEDGE TO THEMSELVES, MUCH LESS TALK ABOUT. I'M IN A POSITION TO INDULGE THEM, PROPERLY. WHEN PEOPLE THINK ABOUT SUCH A PROCESS, THEY DO WANT TO TRIVIALIZE IT. THEY CALL IT ROLE PLAYING. IT'S THE STUFF OF COMEDY. BUT I TELL YOU, DONE RIGHT... AND I MEAN REALLY RIGHT, THERE'S NOTHING COMEDIC ABOUT IT. IT'S THE SOURCE OF IMMENSE GRATIFICATION AND SERENITY. [CORK POPS] AND YOU SENSE IN ME THE NEED, ALSO, TO ENGAGE IN SUCH A... PROCESS? LET'S DRINK TO IT. I'LL AT LEAST TRY THE WINE. IT'S A HEADIER VINTAGE. YOU KNOW, I'M NOT AT ALL INTO FEET. AND I AM CONSIDERABLY MORE VERSATILE. NILES, COULD WE DISCUSS THE SUBPOENA? I THOUGHT WE HAD BEEN. NOTHING HAPPENED. THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK. SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS WITH NILES STERNLICHT. HE INVITED ME TO HIS ROOM FOR ONE OF HIS LITTLE GAMES. AND IN EXCHANGE, ALL OF THIS-- THE SUBPOENA, THE INQUIRY--IT WOULD JUST ALL GO AWAY. AND YOU BELIEVE THAT? DID I SAY I DID? WHAT KIND OF LITTLE GAME? I DON'T KNOW. PUT ON SOMETHING SLINKY, WHACK HIM WITH A RULER-- NOTHING TOO DIFFICULT. AND YOU'RE CONSIDERING IT! WHAT HAVE I DONE? YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING, AND I'M NOT CONSIDERING IT. [DOOR CLOSES] SO, WHY DID YOU GO? BECAUSE IT WAS ALL I COULD THINK TO DO. BECAUSE FIRST, MY ONE BIG IDEA BACKFIRED. AND THEN MY SECOND BIG IDEA--YOU-- NEVER CALLED BACK. I DID. WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE I'M DOING HERE? I JUST HAD TO THINK. I WANTED YOUR PROFESSIONAL HELP. WHAT'S THERE TO THINK ABOUT WITH THAT? YOUR MESSAGE SAID-- MY MESSAGE SAID CALL, WHICH YOU DIDN'T, OK? JUST CALL. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, THEN. YOU KNOW, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S SO ILLEGAL ABOUT WHAT MARGARET'S DOING. I'VE BEEN READING THE PERSONALS IN "THE VILLAGE VOICE" EVER SINCE I PUT THAT AD IN. LONELY PEOPLE ADVERTISE THEIR AVAILABILITY ALL THE TIME. THEY WANT TO BE LOVED. THEY WANT TO GET ... THE "VOICE" KNOWS THAT. SO WHAT? IS THERE SOME BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THEY'RE DOING, PUTTING THOSE PEOPLE TOGETHER, AND WHAT MARGARET'S DOING? THAT'S A TOUGH ARGUMENT. COURTS HEAR THAT KIND OF PITCH ALL THE TIME IN DEALING WITH THESE CASES. SO YOU'RE THE GREAT LAWYER. BE INVENTIVE. HA HA HA! YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WON'T STAND UP IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE, BUT YOU'VE NO PROBLEM TELLING ME TO DO IT AND RISK MAKING A FOOL OF MYSELF. AND WHY WOULD YOU HAVE ANY PARTICULAR PROBLEM WITH THAT? DO YOU LIVE WITH REJECTION EVERY DAY? IS THAT A PART OF YOUR DAILY LIFE, THE AIR THAT YOU BREATHE? I'M SORRY. FORGET IT. I'M NOT REJECTING YOU. OH, FORGET THAT, TOO. DESPITE THE OBVIOUS? BECAUSE OF IT. I DON'T TRUST IT. YOU KNOW WHAT I TRUST? I TRUST SOMETHING THAT I DON'T HAVE RIGHT NOW, AND I'M NOT SURE YOU DO, EITHER. I TRUST BEING ... GOOD AT SOMETHING I LOVE DOING AND MAYBE BEING WITH A GUY WHO'S THE SAME WAY. YOU THINK I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW, BEN. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'RE JUST KIND OF CONNING YOUR WAY THROUGH LAW SCHOOL, LIKE IT'S SOME BIG JOKE YOU'RE PLAYING ON THE FACULTY THERE. [SLAMS HAND] [KNOCK ON DOOR] MIND IF I COME IN? IT'S YOUR HOUSE, BOSS. I WAS IN THE HALLWAY EARLIER WHEN YOU WERE TALKING WITH BEN. I'M AFRAID I OVERHEARD MUCH OF IT. I ... ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. OK. ALL MY LIFE, I'VE GYRATED BETWEEN FEAR OF INTIMACY AND FEAR OF ABANDONMENT. MY COMFORT ZONE WITH PEOPLE? THEY'RE ORBITING ME AT A RESPECTFUL, PREFERABLY WORSHIPFUL DISTANCE. ME AND LEO? NOT ALL HIS FAULT. OK? I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE AS A CHILD TO HAVE NONE OF YOUR NEEDS MET-- EMOTIONAL NEEDS, AND SOMETIMES EVEN PHYSICAL ONES.

NOW IN SESSION IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE HONORABLE SUSIE BELFRAY PRESIDING. DRAW NEAR. YOU SHALL BE HEARD. TWO MOTIONS TONIGHT: ONE TO QUASH A GRAND JURY SUBPOENA, THE OTHER FOR THE ... TO BE REPRESENTED ON THAT MOTION BY A LAW STUDENT. WILL THE LAW STUDENT RISE? DID YOU DRAFT THESE PAPERS? I DID, YOUR HONOR. YES. AND THIS IS TRUE THAT IF I DENY YOU THE RIGHT TO BE REPRESENTED BY THIS YOUNG MAN THAT YOU WILL HAVE NO LAWYER, THAT YOU'LL REPRESENT YOURSELF? YES. THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT. AND DO YOU WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECTION YOU MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE AS TO THE ADEQUACY OF YOUR REPRESENTATION? I WAIVE. GOOD. YOU MAY SIT DOWN. THAT MOTION IS GRANTED. AND I ASSUME YOU HAVE NO POSITION ON THIS, MR. FLANDERS? CORRECT, YOUR HONOR. GOOD. YOU MAY PROCEED, COUNSELOR. THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. I'D LIKE TO CALL THE MOVING PARTY TO THE STAND. PLEASE RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND. DO YOU SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH SO HELP YOU GOD? OF COURSE. WE HAVE A PREFERENCE HERE FOR A SIMPLE "I DO." [COURTROOM CHUCKLING] YES. I'M SORRY. I DO. OF COURSE I DO. [GAVEL BANGS] PLEASE STATE YOUR FULL NAME FOR THE RECORD. MARGARET LANGWORTHY. AND WHAT BUSINESS ARE YOU IN, MISS LANGWORTHY? I RUN A DATING SERVICE. NOW IS THAT ALSO SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS AN ESCORT SERVICE? PERHAPS, BUT SUCH A REFERENCE WOULD BE INACCURATE. THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT I DO AND AN ESCORT SERVICE. AND WHAT IS THAT DIFFERENCE? IN A DATING SERVICE, AT LEAST MINE, IF THE CUSTOMER DOESN'T LIKE THE PERSON I'VE SENT HIM, HE CAN EXCUSE HIMSELF WITHOUT OWING ME ANY FEE. HE'S FREE TO WALK OUT AND SO IS THE PERSON, IN WHICH CASE, OF COURSE, THE CUSTOMER ALSO DOESN'T OWE ANY FEE. AND THE PERSONS YOU SEND ARE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN. YES, AND A FEW IN-BETWEEN. RIGHT. AND ARE THEY EMPLOYEES OF YOURS, OR ARE THEY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS? INDEPENDENT. EXTREMELY INDEPENDENT. [GAVEL BANGS] WHEN THE INDEPENDENT WALKS OUT ON THE CUSTOMER, DON'T YOU LOSE THAT CUSTOMER? ABSOLUTELY. NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN, WITH RARE EXCEPTIONS. AND DOES THAT HAPPEN OFTEN, THE INDEPENDENT WALKING OUT ON THE CUSTOMER? UM, I'D SAY ABOUT 20% OF THE TIME. SO, HOW DO YOU STAY IN BUSINESS? WHY AREN'T YOU FRIGHTENING PEOPLE OFF? GOOD QUESTION. THAT WAS THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM, THAT WE WOULD. I ADAPTED THE RULE I DID FOR MY OWN SERVICE, INITIALLY, AS A MATTER OF PERSONAL DIGNITY. CONTRARY TO EVERYONE'S EXPECTATION, IT WORKED, I THINK, BECAUSE HAVING THE ELEMENT OF CHOICE MAKES THE EXPERIENCE SO MUCH SWEETER. AND THOSE WHO HAVE APPRECIATED MY SERVICE GIVE US GOOD WORD OF MOUTH. [COURTROOM CHUCKLES] WHAT FEE DO YOU CHARGE? $600 FLAT, PAID BY THE CUSTOMER. IT USED TO BE $500. NOW, IS THAT FEE INCREASED IF THE CUSTOMER HAS SEX WITH THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR? ABSOLUTELY NOT. DO YOU REPORT YOUR EARNINGS TO THE IRS? AND YOU PAY YOUR TAXES, AND THE GOVERNMENT HAPPILY ACCEPTS. THEY HAVEN'T SENT MY CHECKS BACK YET. [COURTROOM CHUCKLES] THANK YOU, MISS LANGWORTHY. I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OF THIS WITNESS, YOUR HONOR. MR. FLANDERS, DO YOU HAVE ANY CROSS-EXAMINATION? NO, YOUR HONOR. I HAVE A MOTION TO STRIKE. THIS WHOLE LINE OF TESTIMONY IS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT. WE HAVE SERVED THE SUBPOENA IN QUESTION AS PART OF OUR INVESTIGATION INTO PROSTITUTION. WE ARE NOT OBLIGED TO ACCEPT THE WITNESS' OWN DESCRIPTION OF HER BUSINESS. AND EVEN IF WE DID, IT WOULD ADD CAUSE TO OUR NEED TO INVESTIGATE, NOT SUBTRACT FROM IT. MAY I BE HEARD ON THAT? WHAT DO YOU THINK? THIS IS A COURT. PEOPLE GET HEARD. YOU MAY STEP DOWN. OH, THANK YOU. THERE ARE 6 NEWSPAPERS AND 7 MAGAZINES THAT RUN PERSONAL COLUMNS IN THIS CITY. FOR THAT SERVICE, THEY CHARGE A FEE. A FEW DOLLARS. SO NOW WE'RE TALKING PRICE, NOT PRINCIPLE. [COURTROOM CHUCKLES] WHEN PEOPLE MEET THROUGH THE MEANS OF THESE COLUMNS, SOMETIMES THEY LIKE EACH OTHER AND THEY HAVE SEX. REALISTICALLY, THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THESE COLUMNS. LET ME TELL YOU, COUNSEL, I'M NOT THAT IMPRESSED WITH YOUR ANALOGY. A NEWSPAPER PUBLISHING A PERSONAL AD HAS NO EXPECTATION THAT THAT PERSON IS GOING TO CHARGE FOR SEX. I THINK YOUR CLIENT DOES. MAYBE, YOUR HONOR, BUT THAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE PEOPLE BEING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. MY CLIENT HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY SUCH NEGOTIATIONS. SHE DOESN'T SET THE TERMS. SHE ISN'T COMPENSATED BY THEM IN WAY. SHE HAS NO INTEREST IN THEM WHATSOEVER. YOUR HONOR, THERE IS ANOTHER DIMENSION TO THIS CASE. MAY WE APPROACH THE BENCH? YOUR HONOR, NOT WISHING TO BE ACCUSED OF GRANDSTANDING, MAY I RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THAT THE COURT HEAR MY NEXT REQUEST IN THE ROBING ROOM? YOU WANT TO EXAMINE ONE OF THESE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS? I WANT TO SUBPOENA THE U.S. ATTORNEY. Bailiff: ALL RISE! BASIC POINT, YOUR HONOR. NOT ONLY WAS THERE NO CAUSE FOR THE SUBPOENA, IT WASN'T MOTIVATED BY CAUSE. NOT GOOD CAUSE ANYWAY. IT WAS MOTIVATED BY A VENDETTA. WHOA! A LITTLE MELODRAMATIC, FELLA. YOU WANT ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE U.S. ATTORNEY IS INVOLVED IN A VENDETTA AGAINST YOUR CLIENT? NO, BUT THE PERSON WHO GOT HER APPOINTED IS. AND HE HAS ENOUGH POWER OVER HER TO GET HER TO HARASS ANYONE HE WANTS. OH, YES? AND THAT PERSON YOU BELIEVE TO BE... NILES STERNLICHT, YOUR HONOR. AND THIS IS WHY YOU WANT YOUR SUBPOENA? I DON'T EXPECT YOUR HONOR TO ALLOW ME THE SUBPOENA SIMPLY ON MY SAY-SO. I HAVE 3 WITNESSES OUT THERE WHO WILL EXPLAIN WHY STERNLICHT IS ON THIS RAMPAGE AND TESTIFY TO HEARING HIS THREATS AND HOW THE GOVERNMENT SUBPOENA WAS SERVED WITHIN HOURS AFTER STERNLICHT'S THREATENING TO HAVE PRECISELY THAT SUBPOENA ISSUED. MIKE, HERE'S MY PROBLEM. WHO'S WILLING TO THROW HIMSELF ON THE SWORD FOR A CAUSE HE BELIEVES IN. I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHAT I'M GOING TO ALLOW IN THE SUBPOENA, BUT I'M SURE GOING TO ALLOW HIM TO PUT ON HIS WITNESSES, AND THAT'S GOING TO CREATE A PROBLEM FOR YOUR CLIENT-- A BIG PROBLEM IF THERE'S ANY TRUTH TO THIS, YOU SEE? SO, HERE'S MY SUGGESTION. Bailiff: ALL RISE! DURING THE RECESS, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE U.S. ATTORNEY. SINCE THERE WAS AN OFFER OF COMPROMISE, I THOUGHT IT NOT INAPPROPRIATE TO TAKE THE CALL. I TRUST YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT? NONE WHATEVER, YOUR HONOR. WISE BEYOND YOUR YEARS. THE U.S. ATTORNEY HAS OFFERED TO LIMIT THE SUBPOENA TO MS. LANGWORTHY TO COVER ONLY HER TAX RECORDS AND TAX REPORTS. SHE HAS ALSO AUTHORIZED ME TO STATE THAT MS. LANGWORTHY IS NOT A TARGET OF THIS INVESTIGATION, ONLY A WITNESS, AND WILL BE GIVEN FULL IMMUNITY FOR HER COOPERATION. IS THAT ACCEPTABLE, COUNSEL? MAY I CONSULT? LOOKS LIKE TOTAL CAPITULATION WITH A TRIVIAL ... I AGREE. WE ACCEPT THE OFFER, YOUR HONOR. NOW, WHY DOESN'T THAT SURPRISE ME? Bailiff: ALL RISE! Woman: MS. LANGWORTHY, JUST A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME, PLEASE. Man: WHY DID THE U.S. ATTORNEY CAVE? Man: COMMENT FOR THE RECORD. A COMMENT, MS. LANGWORTHY. NO COMMENT. Man: PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW. Man: MS. LANGWORTHY, PLEASE. THE JUDGE WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU FOR A MOMENT IN THE ROBING ROOM. ALONE. Woman: COUNSEL, DO YOU HAVE ANY... I FEEL DIRTY EVEN GIVING THIS TO YOU. IT'S GONNA RING IN A FEW SECONDS. YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE THE CALL OUTSIDE. [RING] WHOA, WHOA. I WOULD ADVISE AGAINST. [RING] YOU'VE LEARNED A NEW PHONE GAME, NILES. I HEAR THINGS DIDN'T GO MY WAY DOWN AT THE COURTHOUSE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOUR MOTHER? I FOUND HER-- AT LEAST MY PEOPLE DID--THIS MORNING, AND I'VE HAD HER FLOWN TO NEW YORK. ISN'T THAT GOOD NEWS? I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE USEFUL, NO MATTER THE OUTCOME OF THIS EVENING. AND SHE IS IN HEAVEN, ALMOST LITERALLY, WITH AN ENDLESS STASH OF A SUBSTANCE THAT MORE THAN SIMPLY RESEMBLES ... [CLICK] I'M JUST THE DRIVER. PLEASE. SO, YOU GOT A CLERKSHIP FOR NEXT YEAR? WOW. NOT YET. THIS IS NOT THE WAY THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPENING. WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST? I DON'T KNOW. SOME BRAVE KNIGHT AROUND, YOU KNOW, SHINING ARMOR? THAT'S IN A COMMERCIAL, SAM. IT'S PASSE. LOOK AT YOU. YOU KNOW WHERE MY MOTHER IS. NO, I DON'T. I'M JUST A PAGE. PLEASE. YOU COULD FIND OUT. LIKE I SAID, I'M JUST-- TALK TO ME WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING REAL TO SAY. YOU'VE HEARD NOLA'S TRYING TO FIND HER FATHER. YEAH. MARGARET TOLD ME. ONE OR TWO LINES IN YOUR COLUMN MIGHT DO SOME GOOD, IF HE'S STILL IN NEW YORK. LET'S TALK ABOUT IT UPSTAIRS. SO, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? FACTS. SHE WAS CONCEIVED IN KANSAS. SO IT HAD TO BE SOMEONE WHO WAS ONCE THERE. CLEAR THINKING. THAT SHOULD CUT IT DOWN TO WHAT, ABOUT, LIKE 400,000? WE HAVE A NAME... AT LEAST PART OF ONE. WELL, NOW YOU'RE TALKING. HUTCH. Leo: MARGARET, FOR ... SAKE, PICK UP. I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE. NOLA'S IN TROUBLE. WHERE'S THE CAR? DOWN THE BLOCK. WHY NOT OUT FRONT? AND TRIP ...? ... AS AN ART FORM. BEFORE PUTTING ON YOUR COSTUME, YOU MUST REMOVE EVERY BIT OF YOUR OWN CLOTHING. THE MEREST SCRAP OF YOUR OWN CLOTHING WOULD COMPLETELY RUIN THE EFFECT. SO, DO I HAVE YOUR AGREEMENT ON IT? THIS COSTUME... IT WILL OTHERWISE COVER ME? OH, COMPLETELY. WHERE IS MY MOM? THERE ARE MORE THAN 180 ROOMS IN THIS HOTEL. SHE'S IN ONE OF THEM. AND WHEN YOU PERFORM TO MY SATISFACTION, YOU MAY HAVE HER. OK. TAXI! HEY! I NEVER SEND HIM WOMEN. WHY? NEVER MIND. PUT LEO ON. MARGARET, WHY? HE HURTS THEM, BEN. I'M SORRY. GO! GO!
