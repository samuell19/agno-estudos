Well, course we'll have to pay for it, you daft ha'porth. - So we won't own it, then, will we? - Well, er... not exactly. But it means the profits will go to the Government, instead of lining the pockets of the bosses. And then the Government gives the money to us? - No! - So what's the difference, then? Cor! 50,000 GI brides going to America. Kiddies with them, too. Children? But they're not married! Yeah, well, I expect some of them jumped the gun a bit. You know what they say about the Yanks.
