When the Republic of Kallipoly was born. [high pitch voice] What happened in 1998, Mr. Wilson? Well, it began with a tragedy, as most great things do with the death of our inlaws. It began with uh... a tragedy, as most great things do, with the death of a dear relative, who left us a ranch. I set to work on a constitution. And within a year, we had our nation.

No, this won't take long. Good. I got a real busy day. Course you do. You see we started redoing the backyard, putting in a new pool and everything. I did see that. You run it by the fascists? - Yeah, I went by the county office. - Oh, they have no authority. They pulled up the survey. It seems that your fence is ten feet into my property. Those surveys are out of date. They don't include treaties made by me and the previous owner. - These treaties written down anywhere? They were gentlemen's agreements between me and Mr. McGregor. So there's no proof? How's my word? Listen man, I really hate to dothis, but but we're squeezing in this rock waterfall and that pump system needs more space than a golf course. - We could really use this land. - You delcaring war? I'm coming to you as a neighbor, trying to work this out peacefully, so we don't need to get the court involved. - Whose court? The Republic of Kallipoly is a sovereign nation. You're an American, same as me man, no matter what flag you put out front. Listen. Don't be coming to my property,my nation, and telling me what I am and what I ain't. Easy, Grant. I'm just saying, legally, you're a citizen. I wanna fix this in a neighborly way. - Neighborly way, is that it? All right, I'll tell you what, neighbor. You want my land, you want my property? You're gonna have to take it. - This isn't one of your war games, Grant. - I'll take you to court if I have to. All right. Raymond, you just stepped into a cow pieyou ain't never getting out your rug. What's that even mean, man? Get ready for war. Cuz you're gonna get it. You'll hear from my lawyer. You'll hear from my .45. Savannah! Savannah! - I'm busy. - In my office now. - Yes, Daddy? - Did you take my pen? - Which one? - My signature pen. Do not touch my personal property unless I give you explicit permission. - You're supposed to play with toys. - That is a replica model. Do you know how many hours it took me to build that? - That's not some toy you find at a store. You got it on Amazon? No, I... Where's my pen? This one? Damn it, Savannah, this is my signature pen. I wrote our constitution with this pen. This is part of our history. It's a rollerball. With elvish on the side. That's Latin. Do you know what it says? 'Aut vincere, aut mori.' Conquer or die, our national motto. Well, mine is 'live out loud.' This isn't a joke. Are you sure? Do you have any respect for the Republic of Kallipoly? Why would I? All it does is kill my social life. Well, maybe if your deadbeat friends can't respect our nation they shouldn't be your friends. - Well, that kinda rules out everyone. Except a few gun nuts, and total weirdos. What about that Henderson boy? Bobby Henderson? He got expelled for bringing a knife to school. I'm sure he had a reason. Yeah, he was angry and desperate for attention. Sounds familiar. Okay. One more word and you can say goodbye to summer classes. You don't need a community college hack to be a photographer. He isn't Two words, that's it. Goodbye school. I wasn't disrespecting you. No, you contradicted me. - That's disrespect, plain and simple. - So no one can disagree with you, about anything? Watch it. Or what? You'll burn my books? You will respect me and your country. All right, instead of taking photographs of ash trays and fruit bowls you'll spend the summer with me and your brother. I'm not doing your stupid exercises. No, you'll film them. We need a new recruitment video. You can't make me do this. Watch me. Mom. Dear Lord, thank you for all the blessings you have given us.

If you let him win, he'll forget all about it. Mom, you're just enabling him. I'm keeping this family together. ♪ western rock Was it the uniform? - It didn't hurt. - Or the power? I mean, it must be fun to play Vice President. He wasn't President when we met. He was a John Deere salesman with a few crazy ideas. And one of them came true? Not overnight. He lost his job and got more serious. Put up the flag, started going to conventions. But things really picked up the last few years. He, um... found some, well, militant groups online and they buy more courses and beer coozies than we can come up with. Isn't that the American dream? I suppose. Do you think he'll go for it? Put all that behind us? I'll talk to him tonight. He's proud, but I think he'll see the wisdom. ♪ blues rock How you enjoying the local brew? It's good. Different. That's right. Can't find beer like this in Frisco. Yeah. Lot of flavor here. Maybe a little bitter for my taste though. You still talking about beer? What's got you boys so tickled? Oh, just gabbing. That's all. Yeah, nothing worth repeating. Oh, must've been a doozy. Nah, no, you got that wrong. I don't know, Raymond here is ia pretty funny guy. Right, aren't you? He's a real wisecracker. Take it easy, Grant. No, no, it's a compliment. Ya know, it's a nice thing to say. You here to talk, man? Well, I was here to drink, but you seem to have taken over this flea shack, too. - I'm not taking over anything.- Sit down. I'll buy you a brew, a drink. - I'm fine where I am. - That's all right, it's all right. He says it's all right, so it's all right. It's okay, everything's good. Cuz he says it. Why don't you say what's on your mind or let us drink in peace? Why don't we do that? That's such a nice way to tell me to fuck off. - Hey, hey now. No, no, I heardhim. Did you hear him? - I heard him. The same as you. You did hear him, right? I heard him the same as you. I know exactly what he meant. What else you got? Well you know what? I'll be happy to talk property lines here and now. I got no interest in court. You're the one who got the law involved. You didn't exactly give me a choice, - did you? - What choice did you give me? Huh? Listen, you go ahead. Ya know, build your life. Just go ahead, don't worry about me. I'll be fine. I'll just take whatever scraps are left. We're talking ten feet, that's all. Yeah, is that all? Just alittle minor invasion, a littleincursion, a little slice of my nation, my homeland. Why don't you see if Jim wants aslice, too. Think your judge would go for that? - I got nothing to do with this. - I know. You're too goddamn dumb, Jim, to trust. - All right, no, Grant. It's time to go. - Pour me another. - It's time to go. - Pour me one. Listen, I'll come by tonight and we'll talk this out. Okay? One step on my property, and I'll declare it an act of war. You missed dinner. I stopped by next door, had a nice chat with Vanessa. Don't trust a word she says. You know, we can shoot this tomorrow, and just take some time to think it over and maybe sleep it off. No, goddamn it. We're gonna go right now while I'm feeling it. Feeling what exactly? This is completely insane, like a thousand steps too far. You dare to challenge me. You dare to insult me. You dare to dare. Kyle, this is gonna be a crime. Which one? Depends how far it goes, but at least a few misdemeanors. Then we have to make it extra convincing. Make sure he doesn't snitch. Do we still have that dynamite? Okay, that's it. I'm not going to jail for you clowns. Get fucking back behind that camera and you fucking press play. Follow me. Keep that camera right on me. Give me that knife. [war cry] Raymond. We're not afriad of you and we never will be. Give up your little game while you still have what's important: your life. [war cries] And if you call the cops that'll be the last call you ever make. Next time, I won't miss. Is that real? Kyle! Grant. What's this? We have a guest. Is that Raymond already? Good morning, Grant. Oh, Jesus Christ. Do we have to do this now? Do not It's all right, Candice. He's atroubled ma and trouble leads to blasphemy. Is that why you're here? To cure me of my cursing? I'm here to talk, that's all. About what? Whatever you like. Oh, right. Can I get some coffee first? We haven't seen you at services in some time. Well, we got the same book here. Don't you miss the community, though? The gathering of the spirit? Not that spirit. Okay, okay. I saw your video from last night. What? How? Candice showed it to me. What the hell? I couldn't let you send that to Raymond. She did the right thing. The threats you made... If Raymond were to have given that to the police, you'd be in jail already. If Raymond saw that video, he never would have called the police. You were... convincing. But either road leads to more trouble. Instead of making war, why don't you try the Lord's way and love thy neighbor? Ya know, if your pal Jesus saw our world, he'd cut that 'turn the other cheek' crap real quick. Grant. Hey, he thought Sodom was something. Try San Francisco. I'll pray for you. Don't waste your breath. ♪ eerie rock ♪ music fades out What the hell? Do not enter my office without knocking. That's not in the constitution. Is there a reason you're here? What is this map?

Goddamn it, I will not be spoken to like that by my own daughter. Well, then stop all the bullshit and do the right thing. Are you seriously gonna risk everything for ten feet of land? What is the right thing? Hmm? Grovel at the feet of that, that, that... smug bastard? You don't have to talk to Raymond. Just go to the court, tell them it was a mistake, and then move the fence back. It was no mistake. Me and McGregor had an agreement. Well, if you had proof... Since when does a man need proof beyond his own word? Since always. Sir. I'm ready to take the fight to Raymond. What? You're a spy, too? Just doing my duty. What are my orders? Do you guys hear yourselves? You're like one step away from mailing out anthrax. You're packed, ready to go? Yes, sir. All right. Under cover of darkness we're gonna show Raymond what we mean. - What do we mean? - To take out that pump. For good. This is highly sensitive material. Yes, sir. I know. Grant. We need to talk. Dismissed. Savannah told me your plan. You have to stop this war and settle things in court. What war? If you don't go, they'll decide against us and take that land back. And more for the trouble. We could lose everything. They can't do that. They can and will. We're cash poor, and after the third mortgage, the bank owns more of the house than we do. Cash poor? What about the savings account? That's for college, for Savannah and Kyle. They don't need half that money, if that. How many drinks have you had? Not enough. Speaking as Vice President. What? This is a national emergency and you are unfit to lead. Oh, you're gonna impeach me? You don't have the votes. I want you to act up to your title. To behave like a president, not a tyrant. You don't think I'm presidential? That's okay. Neither do I. I'm more of a...philosopher king. Whatever you call yourself, you are failing your country. Better to die free, than live a slave. Where are your chains? Where is your burden? You wanna know where my burden is? You wanna see what's holding me back? Go look in the goddamn mirror. You don't mean that. I could've dealt with Raymond if it weren't for you. And Savannah? You've been poisoning that little girl's head from the start. This isn't about her, or Raymond, or me, is it? This is about you. Like it always is. Yeah? Just keep talking, and I'll tell you what it's about. I'll show you what it's about. Grant, don't. Keep talking. Candice. Babe. It's you. I knew you weren't really one of us, but I didn't think you'd betray the Republic. Excuse me? Attempted desertion, espionage, exposing state secrets. You mean, because I showed Mom your insane video? This goes way deeper than one leak. It's a pattern of sabotage and disrespect. I'm not playing your stupid game. It's not a game. Are you sure? Now can you just leave me alone because I need to find out what happens when Dad fucks everything up. Kyle. Go see if it's dark enough. Yes, sir. You think I'm gonna fuck everything up? It's a safe bet. Fuck you. ♪ dark organ Honey, are you okay? No. [gasp] Oh my God. What happened? I told him the truth. Your father? That son of a bitch. Where's Kyle?

You're coming with me. I can't. Mom, why? What can you do here? Kyle needs me. Mom, please. I can't leave him alone with your father. - How was the mission? - What mission? - That was a goddamn snipe hunt. - Watch your tone. You sent me out there with a dud. Why? To run me tired and shut me up? - Explosive didn't work? - You know it didn't. Well, you must have knocked a casing, slipped a wire loose. I hit the detonator, and nothing happened. So I went back to check, see if I'd set it right. Sure enough, I was detonating a bag full of newspapers. - There must be some mistake. - Cover of darkness. Right, Pop? Good work, soldier. Mission accomplished. This is the good stuff. Pure as it gets. And straight up. Just like God intended. Mmm. Goes down smooth as you like. I'm not gonna toast myself.

We're a nation at war. Wow, easy soldier. You got patrol duty tonight. - I'm done. - I can see that. No, with you and your bullshit. Hey, watch what you say next. - Why? Nothing matters to you, right? - This bomb's a fucking fake, just like you. - Stand down, soldier. - I'm not your soldier, and you're not my Admiral. You can't leave. You can't stop me. I can out run you. Out fight you. - Out shoot you. - You didn't say outsmart. - It won't come to that. - Kyle. Thank God you're all right. Why wouldn't he be? Did you send him out there to blow up Raymond's pump? Don't worry, he didn't do it. - Cuz you gave me a fucking toy! - Honey! Do not speak to your commanding officer with that tone of voice, with that disrespect. - You don't deserve my respect. Oh, listen to that mouth. Your Marines would have you eating boot soon as you got off the bus. - What do you know about the Marines? I served. In the Merchant Marines because you didn't have the gut for war. [bitter laugh] Did you do that to her? - She did it to herself. - You fucking coward. Savannah, we should go. No, no. You should stay. Yeah, I want everybody to hear this treason. So you wanna join the Marines, prove what a big man you are? I'm not proving anything. I want to fight. Actually shoot people, not play in the backyard. Oh, yeah? You wanna fight? Then why don't we just square off right now? - Grant. - No, no this is good. - You want a piece of your old man? - Hit him, Kyle. - Pop me, son. - Stop it, both of you. No, this is between me and the boy. I'm a man, goddamn it. I'm not your boy. - You're my boy for the next sixmonths. - Says who, the Americans? - Their laws mean nothing to you, right? - What does that mean? You're still playing by their rules, living in their world. Call yourself whatever you'd like, but you're not special. You're another stupid American. I... am the Admiral of Kallipoly! You're a dipshit playing dressup. Whoa. I didn't mean that. You know, you surprised me. Okay. A shot for a shot. We're square. - Kyle, that's your father. - I know. - Mom, go pack the car now. - I need, he needs me. We're leaving tonight. - Don't hurt him any more. - I won't if he stays down. -Kyle, you're coming with us. - Where are you going? - Aunt Carol's. - The hell you are! - Mom, pack the car now. Please. - Go on. What are you doing? Completing the mission. Is that... Kyle that's real dynamite. You can't do this. It's pointless, it's all bullshit. So you said. You're going to risk everything for a plan that never made sense. What are you going to accomplish out there? Something. I'm going to actually do something. - I have to defend our nation. - I thought you were done with him. I am. But this asshole's too weak to lift a finger and we have barbarians at the gate. - Well, what about the Marines? They won't take you if you're arrested for domestic terrorism. - That's crazy. Do I look like a terrorist? - Yes! Kyle. Please don't do this. I have to. This is who I am. I know Dad's a fucking moron, but not everything he said was wrong. All we need is a few tweaks to the constitution and a new leader with a vision. - And that's you? Why not? You could be my VP, help me rebrand everything, starting with the name. Kallipoly. I mean, what does that even mean? It's from Plato, kind of. And look. It's really sweet that you want me to nurse your delusions. But I'm out of here. For good.
