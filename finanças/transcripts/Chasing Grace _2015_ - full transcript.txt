A prominent pastor and his wife suffered a tragic blow this afternoon. Horrible what happened to that little girl. And our thoughts and our prayers are with the family. This is a Godly place that had a very ungodly thing happen. I think the community wants to be there for this wonderful family. It's definitely a shock to us all. All of this just stunning this community. The family asking for privacy as they mourn the loss. Some classmates held flowers. We're just tryna make sense out of something you don't make sense out of. Our sympathy and love and prayers go out to the family. What are you dressed up as? - A princess. As Pastor Johnathan likes to say, only our Heavenly Father knows the plans he has for us. They are for good and not evil. To give us a future and a hope. In a family with a long history of boys it seemed a bit of a miracle they'd finally have a girl. What an angel she was. - Thank you so much for coming today everyone. When Gracie came along she filled our lives with such hope. We could scarcely fathom our love for her. And today we honor her life and the short time we were able to enjoy it. Heavenly Father, thank you for friends and family who are there when we need them the most. Help us to love. Help us to love and forgive those who have wronged us even when it seems impossible. Watch over our family Lord. Please, take Gracie into your loving arms. Keep her close to your heart, God. Amen. Amen. What are you doing here? - Don't be so hateful. Don't be a drunk. - That's convenient. - I've got to get back to my family. - Hey. I'm still part of that family. - Not anymore. As a child I recall reading a story from the bible about a father and his two sons. The younger one asked for his portion of the family estate as an early inheritance. He takes the money and runs away to a distant land only to waste his fortune on wild living. But when a famine hits and his money is gone he finds himself in dire circumstances and returns home. He begs to be employed by his father who instead welcomes him. Holding a feast to celebrate his return. This angers the other son who refuses to participate. Saying that in all the time he worked for his father he never received gifts or celebrated with friends. The father reminds that son that everything he owns is already his and that they should celebrate his brothers return. In this story we're encouraged to dwell less on our own past waywardness and to be more concerned with the love of family, celebrating the gift that is their life. As the father of three beautiful children, I often tell them, especially my little angel Gracie, who by the way wanted to make sure I give her a shout out for her birthday. Happy birthday sweetie. Forgiveness is like a hug. You can't give one without getting one in return. I want you to leave today comforted in this truth: love those who love you and forgive those who have wronged you. Peace be with you. And also with you. - Morning Pastor, Angela, Daphne. Hey Gracie. - Missed you in chuch this morning. - No rest for the weary. - What is it this time? - Same old news. - Some people never learn. - Some people need a second chance. - And a third and a fourth and. Sorry ma'am. - Well, like your sermon today Pops, life is short take time to forgive. - Thanks for listening, son. - Like we haven't heard it a million times. - Heard that. - Anyhow, You need to come get him. - Alright. - We'll head back to the house. Start getting ready for someone's birthday party. - Happy birthday to me! Daddy can I go with you? Pretty please? - Come here, sweetie. - Daddy's got some quick business with Sheriff Danny. Why don't you head home with mommy and I'll pick up some ice cream for my-- - Princess for the day. - David why don't you go help your mother and Christopher, you come with me. - What? - Yeah, it'll give us some guy time. Let's go. - Hey, Carter how's next Sunday? - Yeah, great. - Hey, Carter. Don't forget this. - What a sight. - Thanks. Hey Uncle Carter, why do you drink so much? That's a good question son. Let's just say, everybody needs a hobby. - Hey dad, why is Carter so angry? - Son, he's just not real good with people. Look, you go on in and help your mother and I'll be in there in a few minutes, okay? - Okay. - What'd you say? - Yes, sir. - There you go. Can you do me a favor? - Yeah. - Just once try to set a good example for my kids, will ya? I know old habits die hard, buddy. But their young minds are impressionable and they do look up to you. Used to anyway. - Uh huh. - Look, why don't you go inside and dry off and later we'll toss some burgers on the grill. - Hey bro? Thanks for picking me up again. Come out, come out, where ever you are. I know a birthday girl who's about to become It. Hey Chris, look what I found. This time you be the Indian and I'll be the cowboy. - Grace, put that down okay? It could be loaded. Grace! I remember the day she was born. You remember that? - Yeah. - She was like a daughter to us. - She loved both of you so much. You know that right? - It's not fair. - No it isn't. - You gotta be kidding me. What are you doing here? Paying my respects. What's it look like? I thought I made it very clear that you were not wanted around my family. Our family is missing a person. Me. Now let go of my arm. You are trying my patients, Carter. Imagine that. Hello, Carter. Why don't you join me in the kitchen? I made some of your favorite biscuits. Thank you, Daphne. - Looks like we have enough food for an army. Would you put that in the jello? - The wiggles make me giggles. She always used to say that. - I can't imagine. Come here. I loved that girl like she was my own. She loved you too, Uncle Danny. Thanks for being there for me, man. For the whole family. - I wouldn't have it any other way. You know, like we said back in school, roomies for four, best friends forever. You know... There's other solutions to your problem. - Be cool. - Carter? - Christopher. - I wanna say something. - You might want to think twice first. - Oh, I thought about it plenty. - Hey, he's a broken hammer. Uses my jail as a revolving door. - He's had a rough life. - He has? You have. Angela has. The boys have. Because of him there's no more Grace. Look, I think we just need to teach him a lesson. Something to get his attention. - If there was anything that I could do-- - No, there is one thing, you could save us all a lot of trouble and just. - Alright, dude, come on. Let's go back inside. How does payback feel? - Not a fan. - What is going on here? I was just talking to Carter. - Son, this is no way to behave. - Whatever. - Disrespectful drunk. Heaven's no. You are certifiable. You need to take a deep breath. Both of you. - You just can't leave well enough alone, can you? Come on slugger. Let's dry you out, again. What was Carter thinking? Bringing a gun to my baby's birthday party. - He'll get his. - What do you mean? - One way or the other, he'll pay. - You don't mean that. - I'm gonna collapse. I'm gonna go to bed. Hon? - Yeah, honey, I'll be there. I'm just gonna sit out here and think about some things. - As sad as I am, and I have ever been in my entire life, it's our responsibility to forgive him. - This is not forgivable. - Sweetheart, are you coming to bed? Sweetheart? You know mom, I feel like we're just now starting to gain some equilibrium. Well, it takes time. You know stress can hide itself in so may ways. - Actually, I haven't seen Johnathan this stress free since, I don't know. No more shenanigans with Carter? - No, it's been fine. Really. Well, I know the good Lord's on duty. I just want you to know that I am always here to help my little girl. - I know. Thank you. Oh, that might be him. - I'll finish. - Hey, and thanks again for taking the boys. Are you sure you don't mind? - Of course not. It's our pleasure. You two go out and have fun. - Thanks. She wasn't doing this right anyway. - Hello? - Hey, Angel. - Hey, ears burning? Should they be? - I was just telling Mom how excited I am about our romantic evening tonight. So you still wanna go? - Well... Hello? Still there? - Christopher should be at school. He is, isn't he? - No, he's here. - Science class was canceled early so I wen't for a run. I'm gonna grab a quick shower and I'm heading back out. - Okay. I'm back, sorry. So, dinner with the old ball and chain sounds better than left overs, huh? - Yes, silly. And actually you'll be impressed. I'm getting my hair done. I can't wait, honey. Our reservations are for seven. I'll try to catch a little time with the boy's first, okay? - Perfect. Love you. Love you, honey. Bye. - I got a crazy story. See you in 20. I really appreciate this guys. I'll be sure to take good care of it. Thought I would surprise Angela with a little drive around the parkway tonight. A little romantic dinner. - Well, no, thank you. We're headed over to help my brother move and we can pack a lot more in your SUV than we can in this. - We are not helping your brother move, baby. You're dropping me off at the mall so I can go shopping, remember? Because that's my idea of a romantic evening. Just make sure you leave enough room in the car for shoes. What is it with women and shoes? - So, what's the big story? - Please tell me you did not just air quote. - Yeah I did. - Wow! - Alright, whatever. - Wow. Okay, alright. So, I found this stash in the basement. - Okay? - With like a lot of empty bottles. - Oh, no! You guys recycle! - Gosh, okay. Like dozens of empty bottles. - So? - So I guess Dad and Carter spend more time out there than I thought. - Suprise. - Yeah. - I guess everyone needs a hobby. - Hello? - Mrs. Matheson? - Yes? - Officer Reddick from the Mission Grove Police Department. Your husband's been in an accident. - Is he alright? - He's more shaken up than anything just a bump on his head from when he slid off the road. What's wrong mom? Your father's been in an accident. - I just left the E.R. You're gonna have to go pick him up. Go get in the car, okay? Son, son? - Christopher! - Your father's been in an accident. Is he alright? - We're going to the emergency room to get him. - I have rehearsals. - I don't have time to argue with you right now. - Then don't. Serves him right. You know, you're lucky you busted the fender and creased your forehead. It could of easily gone the other way. - Hey look, I kinda need you guys to keep this quiet, okay? I mean, I got this under control, I just slipped. I mean the car just slipped so, we're good? - Johnny, we've been friends a long time, so I wanna be honest with you. I can put a bandage on your head and send you on your way, but if you don't get your head on straight. - Understood and thank you. - And hey, about that other thing-- - Honey, are you alright? I'm fine. Hey sport! Hey, Pops. You're husband's just fine. However, the fender on that little car. - What? - I'll explain later, it's nothing. Seriously, nothing more than a couple of aspirin and some ice won't fix. - He's a lucky guy. Well, it's more than luck. Pastor, you're in good hands. I'll see you later. - I'm just glad that you're safe. Hey, you could say that again. - I'm just glad that you're safe. Right there. - Well, I don't know about me, but you look like you could get some food. I am hungry. Let's get out of here. Is that good? I think so. Do you want another piece? Yes or no? You want another piece? - No, I'm good. - Okay. Nice hat. - It's all the rage, you should try it. See, they even have styles for kids. Cute. - You have to admit that was pretty funny. It's a regular Matheson comedy hour. - Not even gonna ask how your old man is doing? - Gee, I give. How is my old man doing? - Just fine, thanks for asking. - Good. - So your father and I were talking and we would like the both of you to join us for an outing tomorrow. - What is it? - Let's just call it a surprise. - Good morning my Matheson family. Dr. Jefferson Long and your service. - Good to see you. Boys this is Dr. Long and he helps people work though rough spots. - That is right. I am the rough spot fixer-upper. You must be Christopher. - Yes, sir. - Yes, quite a grip. Are you a drummer? - Yes, actually. - And you must be The Little Professor. - The one and only. - Absolutely. - Pleased to meet you. - Yes sir, nice to meet you. Wonderful kids. So, why don't we just have a seat and let's get to know one another. - We were actually just hoping that we can just talk with you first. - Of course. Well, that's perfectly fine. Gentlemen, right this way. Angela. Johnathan. Well then. Where should we begin? - Something is off between us. - What do you mean? I wanted this weekend to be a surprise. - Sliding off the road? I mean that's just not like you. - Accidents happen. - 20 years Johnathan. Through thick and thin. We have never kept anything from one another. - Right. - Angela, be more specific with Johnathan. - Your father was a drunk. Your brother is a drunk. And I was just hoping that, - Ok.. Would you just let me finish? I was just hoping that you wouldn't carry on the legacy. And Frankly I have just about had it. Had what? - Johnathan Randall, you are keeping something from me. And either you come clean and tell me what is going on-- - Or what? - Or I'll tell you what. You will lose your boys. Look at me. Just like your father. And your dignity. Like your brother. And you will lose me. Don't you lie. Don't you lie to me. - I'm not lying about nothing. So that was our outing, huh? - What your father and I were hoping to find was-- - Insight? - Well, I was thinking closure. - Good luck with that. - You boys know how powerful prayer is, don't you? - Sounds like a sermon brewing. You know, sometimes we just need to kind of, check under the hood. Like a psychological tuneup. I mean, an emotional checkup. - God wants to heal our emotional wounds. Here's an idea, why don't we do something we aint done in forever, guys? - Like have any fun? What, Pops? Let's play hookie the rest of the day. I'll be right back. Johnathan? It's fine. Head on in. Mom. Let's go. What's he want? - Your father's got it under control. - That's a first. - Come on, let's go in the house. I thought I told you to stay away. I did until now. Hey, it's my family too. Was. Remember? Is. You are being a jackass. Not sounding very Christian there. - You know I'm not feeling very Christian right now. Isn't it amazing how an accident can tear a family apart? Accident? It's not really an accident, Carter, when somebody blatantly, repeatedly, disregards the rules. That's your opinion. - You know, we just had a really good time. I mean probably the best in a long time. I don't wanna take two steps forward and one back. - Then don't. - Your being around the family kind of does that. - Of all people. How can you not forgive me? - Because you do not respect what is mine. - All I've ever wanted was exactly what you've got. Kids, the perfect family. All of this. - Exactly. And you don't mess with sacred gifts like family. - That's rich coming from you, Pastor. Oh yeah, put it all back on me, why don't ya? Hey, hey, hey. Tell me something. Just be honest. How long are you gonna hold this against me? - As long as you're alive. - You're never gonna let me back in are you? - Nope. Can't. How can I ever trust you when that damn piece of armor never leaves your side? It's for protection. - From what Carter? The wars over, man. Terrorists aren't around here. From what? The Afghan Rebels? What are you thinking dad's gonna come back and hunt you down? Is that what this is all about? - Mom. - No, don't talk about her. - You remember that day? You and I went up to visit them. It was right before you and Angela got married. He was so drunk. She was getting something from the trunk of the car. - And hit her head. Like I said, an accident. - His anger knew no limits. - You don't think I know that? - All those years I tried to protect you. I tried to keep you from the truth. He didn't. - Do you care to share what the two of y'all were talking about? I don't wanna talk about it. - He is family. A friggen mess. And a threat. And now after all these years, - What? He says dad's responsible for mom's death. - You said it was an accident. It is. It was. He doesn't know what he's talking about. - We need to pray for him. Yeah, you do that. - It's okay boy. Just your old man diggin' around the pain barn. You'll never let me back in, will you? You're never gonna let me back in, are you? You're never gonna let me back in. We're gonna have to tell the school to cancel the goldmine field trip. The gold value's gone down a lot. You boy's want some more bacon? - I'll take a piece. Christopher, you sure you don't want any more? I really wish you'd have something else to eat. What's the latest, Little Professor? - Oh the ususal. Market trends of overseas trading, volatility in the growth sector, and the president says phooey to more tax breaks. - Phooey, that sounds official. Morning, Pops. - Morning son. Any stock tips? Yeah, Mission Groves Church stocks increased by 450 % overnight. - That's nice. Dad! - I head you son. Okay gentlemen, start your engines. David with me. Christopher you are on your own. And you my love. Oh brother. I'll take it. Christopher? Have a good day at school. - When do you think Christopher's going to stop being so angry? - I think it's more hurt than anger. Short answer, it just takes time. - Thought you'd say that. - You remember when you and I built the skate ramp last summer? I took the nail out of the board. And you stared at the hole and I asked what you were thinking. - Remember what I said? - Something about how sin was like the hole that was left. - You can remove the sin but the scar remains. Death is like that. - I sure miss her, Dad. - Me too, son. Tell me something Matheson. Chris stop! Hi, Mrs. Matheson. It's Kym. - Hi. Is everything okay? - Um, it's Christopher. He's in trouble. - What happened? Me and Chris were just minding our own buisness getting ready for class when this Peter Vaughn kid just started mouthing off. - Okay, wait a minute, what? What's going on? - I'm really sorry Mrs. Matheson I have to go. I just wanted to let you know that it wasn't Chris' fault. - Wait a minute Kym, did he start a fight or something? Just tell me what's going on. - Peter asked Christopher what it was like seeing someones head get blown off. I'm really sorry Mrs. Matheson. I really am. Hey Dan. Looks like you got some work ahead of you. - Yeah, but she'll be as good as new by the time I'm finished with her. - I'm looking forward to that. - But you know it's gonna be another couple of days, right? - Yeah that's fine. I just need to grab something from the glove box. - Got everything you need? - Sure do. Appreciate it. - Alright, see you later, boss. - Hello? - Whatever happened to that lesson you were gonna teach him? - Well I arrested him, again. And I banned him from his usual places just like you suggested. - And? - Well, you remember that enormous linebacker from college? Went by the name of Baby Hewey? - Yes. Yeah, well I fixed a few tickets. I gave him a small gift to pay a visit. After a separated shoulder, a few broken ribs, shattered nose-- - And? - Let's just say the old coot's tougher than I thought. And Baby Hewey aint gon' be playing football for a long time. - Maybe it's time to turn up the heat. How hot? - Hot. - I don't care what you think. You weren't there. - Son, what I was trying to say, is that I'm proud of you. - What? - If he said to you what Kym told me that he said-- - Wait, she told you? - I wish she hadn't. - She cares about you. We all care about you. Your father is not gonna like the fighting. - He's the one who's telling me to stand up for myself. - And to turn the other cheek. - Great! A sermon from you too. - Look, just sit down with me for a second, okay? What is this boy's name? - Peter Vaughn. - Is he from a good family? - No. - Is he from a godly home? - That would be a no. - So then is it safe to assume that he hasn't had the same opportunities that you've had? - Yes ma'am. - What? - You should of been a lawyer. - Why would you say that? - Because you got this way of being so goodie-goodie, but deep down you can be a real ball-buster. - I don't know about all that. - You could of. - One thing we do know now. - What? - Looks like you've mastered the Matheson right hook. - That's what I'm talking about. Oow. Just kidding. - Come here. - Come in. Hey, Johnathan. - Oh, hey Joshua. What's up? - Well, I wanted to ask you a question. I thought you said when you were driving that you slipped on a patch of loose gravel. - Exactly and sorry again that's a powerful car, man. Kind of got away from me there. - You wanna tell me what this is all about then? - Was that in the car? - Yeah. - Oh, Carter. I shouldn't of picked him up. - You've been quiet. What's up? - Something Dr. Long said. - Yeah, what's that? - Well it was mostly crap but he said something that I wasn't expecting. He said, next time I find myself in a situation like that just imagine what Gracie would do. And all that I can think about is that she'd just smile and laugh like she'd always do. - It's a good mantra, huh? Hey. - Yeah. - Granna. - Hello, grandson. I hope the other guy looks worse. The Professor is in his room. He got a ride home early. He's been really quiet. - Does it ever end? - Not really. But I'm here for ya. - Thanks, Mom. - May I come in? - Come on in Mom. - Everything okay? I'm fine. - You sure? Okay? - Do you think if Christopher hadn't chased Grace into the house, she'd still be alive? Was it my fault? All I can remember is we were having so much fun. And then it was her turn to be It and, and I remember he saying, if you weren't carrying The Professor, you would be able to catch me. And I just keep thinking that maybe, just maybe, if I had held on that she would still be alive. - David, it is no more your fault than old man Tucker who lives down the way. - Old man Tuker's like 95 years old, Mom. He couldn't even pick up a gun if he tried. - That's my point exactly. Do you believe that God allows things to happen exactly the way he chooses? - Doesn't make sense but I guess that's why they call it faith. - Then maybe, God chose that it was Gracie's time. And it was his plan that her mission here on earth was complete. Just like my purpose, hey. My purpose and your fathers purpose is to help you grow to be a teacher or an inventor or whatever you imagine. - And Christopher could be the next-- - Michael W. Smith? - I was thinking more of Pitbull. - Who? - Never mind. Johnathan you assured me you no longer had a problem with alcohol. Those were Carters. I picked him up and we went for a spin. - His bottles on your side of the car? - He must of tossed them there when we stopped to get gas. - Interesting. - Why? - The car was filled up when it gave it to you. - Okay, we stopped for smokes for Carter at the gas station is what I meant. - Was that before the accident? - Yes. - So, where was Carter when Officer Mahler showed up? - Carter walked to the payphone to try to get help. - Look, these are from the insurance company. The Sheriffs report says you called it in. From this number. Isn't that you cell phone? - Okay, I forgot, you guys never forget? - Surely you can appreciate how this looks. - Yes, but I can explain everything. - Johnathan I think, actually we all think, you've got more of a problem than you believe. - We feel like you should take a leave of absents. Until you can sort this out. We also think it would be smart if you put the Family Center plans on hold. - But this church is everything to me. - And we sympathize with everything that you've had to go through. - Stewart, Stewart, I promise you this is not what it seems. - I know that. It never is. - So to wrap things up, I'll take over as active pastor until we get all this worked out. And of course we will look forward to this all working out. Carter Matheson? - Hey guys. How are ya? - You're under arrest. - Really? - Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. - Oh boy. You have the right to speak to an attorney. - Yeah. - You've heard this drill before. - I have. Thank You. - To the car. - Missed you guys. - Missed you too. - Nice cologne. - Hey is my favorite seat here-- Yeah, it's warm. It's ready for you. Oow. Thanks a lot. What was your favorite thing you had for dinner tonight? - Oh for dinner. - I like that steak. - Well try this, it's a small bite. - Mmm mmm mmm. It's good. - Better than mine? - No, not even close but it's good. - I can't remember the last time we had a romantic evening like this. Especially in a fancy restaurant. - Can you give me a multiple choice? - Can I get you all anything else? - No thank you. - I think we're good. - What is that? - Iced tea it's really good. - Oh, this. - That must be for you it's not for me. - You remembered. - Wanna take a look? Why not? - Oh my gosh. Happy anniversary Mrs. Matheson. Would you still be my wife always and forever? - Sweetheart. - Alright, your arraignment is set for next week. - You guys just had to stir it up, didn't you? - He decided to press charges after all. Carrying a concealed weapon on private property not once but twice. - I'm a vet. - But your brother specifically asked you not to bring a gun on his property. - Something smells bad. - It's probably you, Champ. - Whoa, settle down ladies, settle down. - And this couldn't wait. - No, court needs it and I'm going fishing this weekend. Just to show you that there's no hard feelings lets go get your car and head over to the Handle Bar. I'm buying. - I'm not thirsty. - That's a first. - Or we could just let you settle in for the night. - I don't suppose one would hurt. - Not at all. - Is she gonna be alright? - Yeah, she's okay. She just needs to rest. She's gonna be fine. Let's go get something to eat. Code blue. Code blue. You boys keep it down. Your mamma's trying to rest. Honey. Are you okay? - He was right. She died right there. - That was certainly a great way to start the day. - Oh, I should of stopped at two. - I should of stopped at three. - I should not have stopped. - Be careful going home. 'Cause the cops around here can be pretty tough. - No you don't worry about me. Country air just clears my head straight up. Thanks for the guys drinks. I mean, you know what I mean. - Go! - Woo! What is he some kind of clown? Two can play this game. Boy has got a sense of humor. - License and registration please. - You know I was just saying to myself-- - Do you have any idea how fast you were going? - Come on Reddick. - It's Officer Reddick. And you were speeding and have a busted taillight. License and registration, please. What is that man up to? Dispatch this is Officer Reddick. Requesting backup for a 1050. High speed pursuit. Roger, we need your location. Approaching the cliffs at Lake Pixel. Roger, backup on the way. Possible 1055, suspect is driving reckless. Officer request the paramedics. Nice little pickle you've gotten us into, dipstick. - What? You said that-- - Hey, hey, settle down, Nancy. Let me think, let me think. Who knew that maniac was gonna run? - Let's see, we made his life as miserable as possible. Plus, he's facing the long stretch. - True. There's no way he'd allow being locked up like some animal. - You said there's no sign of him. - Nope. - There's no way he survived that fall. - Nope. - You know, I'd forgotten it was that high up. - Well we might have just gotten lucky after all. - Hey. - Hey. Thanks. - Anything you wanna share? - Yes and no. - I understand. I think. - I'm not sure which clique works best in this situation. - What do you mean? - Things aren't always as they seem or it's time for a change. - How about both? - I'm the Black Ops master. - Master wankers more like it. - Dude, what the heck? I was winning. - Whatever. - What's got you in such a mood? - My grades suck. I get in a fight and I'm nearly suspended. And then my parents have me seeing a shrink. - I guess that would do it. - I wanna see what the big deal is. - The big deal about what? - Stuff. - That really narrows it down. - You ever wonder why some people preach one thing and then do another? - What do you mean? - Parents aren't fair. - Yeah but they make the rules. - I mean if everyone's doing it then why not us? - What are we even talking about? - Getting loaded must be some kind of fun. Or else they wouldn't do it so much. - Yeah my old man likes to tilt a few. Personally I don't get it. Like it's stupid. - Well if it cured my nightmares I'd do it. - Dude I'm sorry I didn't, I mean-- - No, it's fine. I'm over it. Let's try again. Of all people, how can you not forgive me? Because you do not respect what is mine. What was Carter thinking? You're never gonna let me back in, are you? Nope. Can't. It's our responsibility to forgive him. How long are you gonna hold this against me? As long as you're alive. - Hey, Johnny. - Hey, Danny. Hey, I'm just heading to lunch. Wanted to see if you cared to join me. - Oh no man, I just picked mine up. I'm heading back to the station. What's going on? - Just wanted to catch up. - I'd love to bro but I got a pile of paperwork. - Giving up lunch with your best pal to do paperwork? - Yeah it's a big caseload, big caseload. - Say, whatever happened to-- Hey Johnny? Hey, sorry man that's the station. Gotta go. Hey, I'll catch you later. - Mom? - Hi, son. You smell like a little boy who's been outdoors playing. - You always say that. - Well, you'll always be my little boy. - It's been a long time since you've been in that room. - What are you doing home so early? We only had a half day. Mom! - Well the engines gonna be totally water locked. - Hey Dan. - Hey Pastor Johnathan. - Hey Johnny. I thought you were due at the station? - Yeah, I was gonna head back. - Gents, I've got a lot to do. So if you need anything just give me a holler. Look I'm just-- - Avoiding me. - Where's Carter? - I don't know. - Just up and left town huh? - Probably. - Gone this long without a trace. - Coulda. Hey look I've gotta get back to the office. - Hold on a minute. So when were you gonna tell me? - About what? - About pushing Carter into the lake. - Like this. Yeah. - See this crease right here? - Yeah. - About the exact size of your front bumper. - Nuh uh. No. - Yeah about the size of your work truck right there. - Everything's gonna be fine. Your mom's a trooper. - Yeah I know. - And your father's gonna help us figure it all out. He's smart like that. - Where do you think I get it from? - Hi Daphne, everything okay? - Um, I'm fine. Angela is not. - What's wrong? - Well she passed out. She's gonna be fine. And thankfully David was there to help when it happened. - So she's alright? - Yes, she just wanted you to be here with her. - Okay, where you at? The hospital? - Oh no, no. Dr. Long's. We're here now. Will I see you in a few? - Okay I'll be right there. We're not done. - I've been trying so hard to be the perfect mother and perfect wife-- - Baby, you're all those things. - Depression is a very tricky thing. And given Angela's particular form of MDD, Major Depressive Disorder, it's even more so. He said it's like depression times ten. - Imagine burying painful emotions so deeply that for lack of a better term, one looses track of time. - And it wasn't until David came home early that I-- - She woke up. Yes? Okay send her in. - What is it? - Christopher. He's in jail. - Go ahead. More of 'em out than in. - Very funny. - How you feeling? - What do you think? - Be glad nobody was hurt. Then you'd be up the creek without a paddle. Just use your head. - It was his fault okay, he started it. - Sure it was. Okay ladies, what we got? Three counts? DUI, Reckless Endangerment, and Speeding. Bonafied trifecta. - Call his parents. - Already did. They're on their way. I mean how much more of this can we take? Not much more I'll say that. And what are we supposed to do? How about ground him for life? - He's fine. Just a little green around the gills. What? Reddick was coming back from Davidson, saw a swerving truck. - What's happening to this family? What were you thinking? I just wanted to-- - Get a criminal record? - No. See what the big deal was. - Where did you get it? Please answer me. - I don't remember. - So now you wanna add lying to the list of charges you have? - We should probably just discuss this at home. - No, our son is sitting in jail okay-- - Okay, okay, folks. I've got some good news. I pulled a few strings. Looks like he can go but with probation. - Personally, I think you should stay here for a few days. Along with you. - Um, never mind. Thanks. - Now I'm only half the equation. - Why? - Shortly after we brought him in we got a call. His bail has been posted. - What? - Whoever it was made it disappear. - Imagine that. Let's go. Let's go. We're not done. - I don't see what the big deal is. - Where did you get the booze from? Answer me! - They were hidden under the house. - What? - Tell your mother the whole truth, son. - I noticed you didn't look all that surprised tonight. - Like Dr. Long said, couples that have been together as long as we have know everything. - When? - The first time was Gracie's birthday party. - It was pretty obvious. You weren't sleeping. And then at the hospital. Your jacket reeked of smoke so I just assumed you were at a bar. And then wrecking Josh's car? Sweetheart you're an incredible driver. - I'm so humiliated. - How about repentant? - All this time you cope by disappearing into a world of grief. - And you coped in your own way. - Honey I'm, I am very sorry. - And I forgive you. And I hope the boys will too. - There's one more thing I've gotta do. - Carter? - Johnathan. - Where have you been? - In the trees. Watching you. - I mean for the past several weeks. - MIA. Like the old days. - I saw your car at the junkyard. - Imagine that. - So what are your plans? - Gonna finish my work out, pack, leave. - Then what? - Disappear. But for good this time. - Why? - Isn't that what you always wanted? Come on. Join your brother for one last drink. - I can't. Hey, it's not that I don't want to. It's just that I made a promise. - Dude, you suck. - What? - You can't play worth crap. - Lucky. - Whatever. - It also sucks the way you've been acting. - Oh really? Mr. Perfect. - No, seriously. This family is on the edge of ruin and you're running around like a primadonna. - Okay, whoa-- - Hey, I'm not done. Look, I get that your grades suck, and girlfriend's on the fritz, and dad's always yelling at you. And I get that but, as they say, them's the rules. - Thanks David. What? - It's funny it's, it's nice to hear my real name. - You like that better than Butt-Munch? - See you take a perfectly good brother moment and you know what just give me the ball. - Take it. Are you kidding me? I'm done. I'm done. Alright. I'll see you later David. I mean really? - All these years Carter let me believe Mom died from natural causes. - And? - It was my father's fault. - How's that? - Lieutenant Kernel's always taking his well-known anger out on others, repeatedly. - How'd that make you feel? - I don't know. - Johnathan? - Bitter. Hurt. Pushed aside. - And? - Randal always, he blamed his father. And Carter and I, we blamed... I think I'm blaming. - What? - They all went out for ice cream so, we thought we could sneak a few more. - Go on. - I gotta stand up. Couldn't let the kids see us like that so, took Carter to the bedroom. His gun was right there. I heard 'em, I heard 'em coming up. I freaked out. I buried it. I buried it. Just like I do everything. I buried it. Meet me out front in five minutes. - Johnny, look. We only meant to scare him. Not kill him. What? - You didn't kill him. It's Carter we're talking about. Anyway, he is about to disappear, again. Well that's good right? He's my brother. - Okay. - Maybe we've been trying to teach that old dog the wrong trick. So school's almost over, isn't it? Yeah. School's better. The year's kind of closing up so it'll be good to get out. Oh look who's here. Wasn't expecting this. How's it going, Pops? It's root beer. Yeah, I like this a lot better. - Thought you were gone. - I had to clear some things up with my nephew before I left. - And I figured it was time to stop being a jerk. - Let me ask you something Carter. - Yeah? - What would you want more than anything in the world? - You know that answer. - Humor me. - To be apart of the family again. I mean a real part. Not just on the outside looking in. - What if I could promise you one better? - Uh huh? - On three conditions. - Oh here we go. - One, you start giving back to the community using your God given talents. - Uh, chopping wood? - That's funny but close actually. I'll explain later. Number two, stop drinking. - I can't promise that. But I'll try. If you do too. - Done. - Here comes number three. - For all the bitterness and pain I've caused you, will you please forgive me? You're not gonna hit me? - No, get over here. I'll drink to that. Cheers. - Oh, one of these days. Yeah, see. See how that works? Hey brother. Oh, hey. - Whatchya doin? - Just thinking about Gracie. My boys. My brother. What are you guys doing here? - Well the board had a meeting last night. And with Angela's prompting we've decided the church really needs to get back on track. - I get it. - No son, it needs to get back on track with you at the helm. Isn't it you and mom that always says that everyone needs a second chance? Could my brother actually be speechless? - Never. No kidding. - So Angela says you're looking at this property, huh? - Yeah, I just want to do something in honor of Gracie's memory. Thinking about building a Center right here. - Nice. - What do you think son? - Yeah. I think she'd like that. She'd like that a lot. - So, give me an idea of what you're thinking. When most people read the story of the prodigal son, they focus on the prodigal. But I'll never forget the day God showed me the importance of the brother. ♪ Grace ♪ A gift we all have ♪ Just let it unfold ♪ Sweet spirit running through ♪ Every one of us ♪ To never doubt faith ♪ Giving us a chance ♪ To be ♪ Transformed into a ♪ Brave new world ♪ Oh ♪ This possibility ♪ Love ♪ It truly is ♪ The only ♪ Way ♪ To speak to one another ♪ So open your heart ♪ To never doubt this ♪ To giving us a chance ♪ To giving us a chance ♪ To be ♪ To be ♪ Be ♪ Transformed into a ♪ Brave new world ♪ Oh ♪ This possibility ♪ Grace ♪ A gift ♪ We all have
