Will you please stop filming me, you're being a creep? Come on, you love it, that's why you're dressed like that. Haven't you ever heard of Me Too, this is harassment. Come on baby, show me those great legs. You a dancer? No, I'm not, I'm just going to a party. Hey, you and me, we could have a party. Just because I'm wearing a short skirt, doesn't mean that you can hit on me. Impropriety invites lust. You must, on an unconscious level, be filled with wanton carnal lust. What are you talking about? You think she's hot, you lust after her? Do you still want her? You too will pay the price for your sin. Book of John, beginning with chapter 13 verse 34: A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another. As I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that you're my disciples, that ye have love one to another. As you know, this has been the message that we have lived by in our relationships with each other and also, with the world outside. And it has stood us in good stead, at a time when some congregations are shrinking, we've managed to hold on by staying strong, healthy and diverse. I believe our congregation will continue to stay strong under the auspices of our new monsignor, Father Brock. He's been assigned here by the diocese to help us grow even more. Please say hello to Father Brock. Good morning to you all. I look forward to serving as monsignor for this church. I've been brought on in hopes of bringing this church back to its glory days, by creating a larger, more unified fellowship. It is my great privilege, to serve the word of God to you each week. Oh Dean, you're such a church flirt. No I'm serious Alice, you and I should go get a cup of coffee sometime. If not right this instant. After all the times I've asked you and you put me down, now you're Mr. Hot-to-trot? It was never the right time Alice but now it is. Seriously, now I'm finally ready to take you up on your offer. Well I'm not surprised that this new monsignor showed up when he did, Kate, I'm telling you, I heard the diocese has it in for Father Dalton, that's why this new guy is here, to eventually replace him. Well how do you know? My friend in the diocese office, she's heard them saying bad things about Dalton. He's too liberal, too welcoming to all types, blah, blah, blah. Types? Don't make me spell it out for you Kate. I think you know what that means. Are you sure you're not putting me on? Alice, my intentions are honorable. You're the one for me, I swear. Cross my heart and hope to die. That sounds pretty serious. But still you rebuked me far too many times. Are you guys still at it? Jeez, when are you guys gonna stop fooling around here and get serious. It's every bit as tempestuous as it seems Diane. Today it is. Kate, tell Dean I'm no longer interested, he put me on way too many times. You've been dragging your feet too long on this one Dean. Hey, I eagerly await your phone call. Mitsy, Jean, Sarah, Lydia and James, everybody, how are you guys? I'm good. Not bad, right James? Nothing yet but it's still early babe. You're such a jerk. He really is. Well I've run out of my new favorite eyeliner, so today's very trying. I told you sweetheart, we'll stop on the way home and look. I understand Jean, believe me. Are you okay sweetheart, you look a little worried. This week is her last meeting with the psychologist, she's nervous. Congratulations, you're so close. You're worried aren't you? Yeah, what if I don't like the way I look? I keep telling her, she'll look good whatever gender she wants to be, Kate. You're lucky you have such a supportive mom Jean. I know but there's no turning back from that. Why don't we have drinks this week? Friday night, maybe we'll have a glass of wine, we'll talk? For sure. Hey, how's my girl, hanging in there? You look so pretty. Thanks but I'm a mess. She's out of eyeliner. Hey guys. Hey Callie. What do you guys think of the new monsignor? I don't know, seems okay. Seems like a cold fish if you ask me. You didn't of course, it's a free unsolicited opinion. They're not getting rid of Father Dalton are they? What, no, they can't be, this is terrible. No one's saying that Callie. I hope not, he's been so good for this community. Yeah and he's helped me with my transition. Yeah, where do fathers go anyway? I have no idea but I'm gonna find out. Yeah. Thanks a lot for coming, see you next week? Yeah, yeah, thanks for coming. See you next week, I think. Father Dalton. Hey Kate. What's the story with this new monsignor? This is the first I've heard of it. They just sprang it on me this week. You're not gonna give the sermon any longer? Well as monsignor, it's Father Brock's right. He's been a priest for a long time, I'm sure he's honed his homilies by now. Well you're my priest and don't you forget it. I wouldn't have it any other way Kate. See you later, yep. Father Dalton? Monsignor Brock. Who's that woman? Oh that's Kate Hoser, she's been a member of my congregation for a long time. She isn't a? Yes, yes she is Father. And you're okay with this? Have you talked to her? It's not really any of my business, the way I see it. It's God's business. If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, they both have done what is detestable. They shall be put to death. Leviticus 20:13. Monsignor, there's a reason why this church has flourished, it's because we love and accept everyone, as I believe God does. God doesn't accept it. No, life is lonely and if somebody finds real love and sucker with another person then who am I say to say they can't accept them because that person is of the same sex? God doesn't accept it Dalton. I am disappointed with what I've seen here today. Some people in your congregation look like drug addicts and what I assume is a man dressed as a woman. Sinners are not welcome in the body of Christ. This is the message that we will be going forward with from now on. So baby girl of mine, how was church? It was good. Thought Father Dalton's service was really nice. Apparently we're getting a new priest, Dalton's not gonna give our sermons anymore. I'm a little worried. Listen baby, no offense, you know I love, love, love, love you but I just, I don't know why you go there anyway. I mean, what does it do for you Kate? All this Bible stuff, it seems so out of step with us and where the world is going today. I just believe in God and I have faith that he loves us. He, God is some story the patriarch made up to keep us down, when you gonna realize that? I don't think God has a gender. I think God is love, pure and simple, and he, she or it, just wants us to emulate that love. But I feel God in that church and you should respect my feelings as the person that loves me. God, I hate it when you get sanctimonious, you're lucky you have a great ass. Yeah , I kinda do, don't I? This as you know, is my first time in the pulpit. It is my deepest wish that everyone in attendance here finds solace in a spiritual manner in the word of God that is being spoken here. At this time, as a newcomer to this church, I feel that I should comment on some of the behavior that I have seen, in such a short time. There's been much talk about how this church is a thriving part of the body of Christ. But that body is under attack. It is threatened by the behavior of most of the parishioners. Within this body, there are people that are abusing themselves with drugs, to the point that their bodies are falling apart and being eaten. There are those of who, that are confusing sex by wearing women's clothes. Defying the gender that God gave you. And perhaps worst of all, many of you are defiling your bodies with the same sex. The Bible calls this degrading and sinful and this is a rebellion against God. This church must stand firm and steadfast against behaviors that the Bible declares as sinful and not give way to secular... Who are you to judge anyone? Miss, it is rude to interrupt. I'm sorry Father Brock but you have no right to stand up there and insult myself or anyone else in this congregation. Miss Hoser, this is my church and I see fit to preach the word of God however... This is not your church, it belongs to everyone in this congregation. Everyone who's ever reached out to the sick or the homeless, everyone who's ever just tried to show the community what love really looks like. I don't think this is what love looks like Father. I am the monsignor here. I have a responsibility to present the whole word of God. These people are my responsibility. I'm sorry to cause any trouble but I don't think what you're saying is doing anyone any good. So I have to leave. What she said, come on Mom. Right. Let's go. I'm sorry, this just won't do, not at all. This isn't right. I hate to say it but Dean is right, Mr High-and-mighty, this is just wrong and won't do. I thought you guys were supposed to help people. I guess maybe not, come Lydia, let's go. Have to say, you're a real jerk, Monsignor Brock, you know that? God is love, God is love, God is love, God is love, God is love, God is love, God is love, God is love, God is love, God is love, God is love, no to hate. We are live at an angry protest which is going on right behind us at Saint Bartholomew's Church, where protesters are angry about a recent turn of events at the church. Can you tell us what this protest is all about? We're protesting the new monsignor of Saint Bart's, who has come out against many of its members, including the LGBTQ community. But isn't he just reflecting the church's stance on these issues. Well, we'll always seen Saint Bart's as a place that supports people in the community when they're going through tough times and Father Dalton was there for me when I was desperate and needed support, and we think his good work should continue. What about you, ma'am, what has your experience here been? Well when I first started questioning my gender, Father Dalton assured me I was still a valid person. And I'm her mom and you know what? She is a valid person and it isn't right for anyone, especially a priest to tell her otherwise, is it? And you folks, what do you have to say about all of this, are you feeling slighted like these others? Father Dalton was instrumental in helping James to kick his addiction and now Father Brock says James can't even come to the front door? Yeah he's always been there for us and now we're here for him. No to hate. Well there you have it, people in the community accusing the new monsignor at Saint Bart's of being uncaring as well as unsensitive to the needs of his very own community. Back to you Steve. God is love, God is love, God is love, God is love, God is love, God is love. Well they say there's no such thing as bad publicity. God is love, God is love, God is love, God is love, God is love, God is love, God is-. A letter from Paul to the Corinthians. Continue. Perhaps we need to change our tactics Monsignor? We truly do Dalton, we need to cleanse this church. Find a way to bring these terrible sinners back to the grace of God. What is your problem? Hmm? You have it turned around my dear, it's not my problem, it's yours. You were the one that laid into me the moment that I walked in the room. All I asked was what do you think of this sign? "Who gives a fuck," is not an appropriate response. Then why do I feel that that's all I'm getting from you? What are you talking about? Every since this whole Father Brock thing boiled over, you haven't spent five minutes with me, ergo me thinking you don't give a fuck. Come on Tara, this thing is about our rights, it's about people thinking that we're sinners when we're just different. You should be out there fighting with me. You didn't ask me. You hunkered down with all your marginalized friends and then started planning for war. I didn't think that you actually wanted to join me, you don't even like my church. I don't and I don't understand why you'd wanna be part of some group that doesn't even want you. If they do take you back, does that mean that you're not gonna want me? God no, God. Tara, when I see you, I feel love, when I feel you and look at you, I feel love. More than I do anywhere else in the world. Really? God, yes. You're so hokey. Yes but you like it. A little. Come here, please? Sister of fire, sister of light. Scourge of demons who move by night. Remove their evil with thy might. Whip the sinners 'til they bleed bright. You heard my supplication. Help me. Stop, what are you doing? I don't know what you're doing. Kate wake up. Kate wake up, Kate baby wake up. Kate wake up, Kate wake up. Kate, wake up. You're okay Kate, Kate wake up. Are you all right? I don't, there's something, there's something there. Where? Oh God it was, it was there, I saw it. Well there's nothing there now. It was, it was a nun. A nun, you saw a nun in the closet? Yes, yes, a nun, oh my God. Sweetie, I think your faith is making you crazy. Yeah? Yeah, go back to sleep, it was just a dream, just a bad bad dream. I'm right here. A nun, you woke up from a horrible dream to find an evil nun watching you from your closet? Yes, she shrieked at me. Do you think maybe you were still dreaming? It didn't feel like it. Listen Kate, you know I respect you and between you and me, I fully support what you and the others are doing, but do you think that maybe your dream is a reflection of your anxiety over this whole fight with the monsignor? That's what I told her. But then why would it be a nun? Why not just be Father Brock instead, right? I don't know. Sister of fire, sister of light, scourge of demons who move by night, whip the sinners 'til they bleed bright, remove their evil with thy might. James? James, James? Lydia, you're back so soon. I brought you what you need. Why would you bring me that? Because you hunger for it James. That stuff nearly killed me last time. Don't lie, you know you want it. No Lydia, I don't. You hunger for it James. You hunger for it James. No I don't Lydia, I've been clean for almost a year. It's the thing that you need. Give into it. You know deep down inside, that you want it. Please, no, no. You must have it, yes. No, I don't. Yes. No, I've been clean for almost a year. Just give into it. No. Stop struggling and just give into it. No please. Come on James. No, no. Give in, just give in. Find it. No, leave me alone. Find it. I really don't wanna do this. I don't wanna become this. You don't want to do this, you don't. Do it. I really don't wanna do this, I really don't. Do it. Do it. I don't. You want it. I don't. Do it. James? Yes can I help you? Hi, I'm Kate, I'm a friend of James and Lydia's. I just heard what happened. Oh yes, she's told me about you. I'm Lydia's Aunt Marla. It's not a good time for her right now, I'm sorry. Let her in Marla. Okay, not for too long, okay? Lydia, I am so sorry, I am so sorry. I am too, all he needed was some light. Lydia you should rest. You've been through something terrible. James would want you to take care of yourself. Well James isn't here, is he? He made sure of that. He made God damn sure of that. Kate's a friend, a good one. Thank you Kate for coming over but just be brief, okay? This is my aunt, my jailer. I'm only trying to help Lydia. She means well. Mean well doesn't mean much Kate. James meant well and then he had a moment of weakness and all of his goodness just died with him. He tried Lydia, as hard as he could. Well not hard enough. I don't understand what happened, he was doing so well. He had beaten his addiction. I don't know what triggered it. I don't even know where he got the stuff from. Who can know the mind of an addict? They walk a tough road. I just, I came in this morning and... You know, how could this happen? I know. Kate please, just go, she's too upset. Just go, leave now. Look what you've done. Oh Lydia. Father Dalton, are you here? I wanna talk to you about some things I've found. Hello, Father Dalton? You have betrayed your faith. I didn't mean to. What are you doing here, you wretched fallen woman? I, I... Go and just so you know, I have made plans to have you excommunicated from this church. May your soul be damned to hell forever. Things hit me, oh my God. Things just flew at you? Tara, don't, don't look at me like that. Kate what's happening to you? Don't Tara, no don't please, you have to believe me. I swear, I'm not crazy, I swear to you that this happened. I knew this would happen. I knew this would happen. What are you talking about? You, me, your faith. What are you trying to say? Is being with me so wrong? So against your religion that you have to imagine that this stuff happens because of me? No, no, no, it is not Tara, that it not it, it is not about you. I love you, I, God, I love you. You have to believe me, you have to believe me. You have to believe me! Sister of fire, sister of light. Remove their evil with thy might. Scourge of demons that run in the night. Whip their bodies 'til they burn bright. Beware, the change is coming, beware. Jean? Jean, Jean, where are you? I'm here Mom. Son? Where are you? I'm not your son anymore, I had the operation. Don't you like it Mom? What did you do? What do you think? Oh no, oh no, oh no. What did you do to yourself? It's me. I don't know what you are. It's me. No, you stay away from me, you freak. Freak, you're a freak. Freak. You're a freak. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. Freak. Jean? Jean, Jean, are you in there? Hello, yes I need help. I knew no good would come from renting to this kid. Jean's a good person Mr. Parker. Says you, you don't know how many times I have to come here and fix things. Come on, just unlock it already. Somebody could need help in there. Stay here ma'am, I'll go in with him. How does a person, oh my God. Hold on a minute, hold on. You don't have a queasy stomach or anything, do you? Why do you ask? Well, sometimes when you go into these places, you never know what you're gonna see. I usually end up having to wipe vomit off of my shoes. Ah ma'am, it's police. Are you home? Jean it's your landlord, are you here? Let us know if you're here, okay? Oh my God. What? Holy shit! What the fuck happened here? Oh no, hey come on man, pull yourself together, what you doin', call it in. Give me a minute. - Oh my God, it's the lady! - Jean no, no! - I can't. - Go, go, miss, you gotta go. No God, no God, no, no. Why is this happening? Ma'am, take a seat, please. - Take a seat ma'am. - I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Take a seat. It's going to be okay. It's not okay, my friend is dead. Kate, for the love of God, I'm really sorry about Jean but how can it be connected to James passing? Both of them, God rest their souls, were in high risk suicide groups. No, James was doing much better. Oh shit. - That was really fucked up. - He was recovered. Or at least on his way to recovering and Jean, Jean, yes she was nervous about her surgery but, to kill herself. But connected Kate, I don't think so. You're forgetting about the medallions, why would I find one at my house and also at the both of theirs. What did these medallions look like? It has a cross in the center, a branch on the left and then a sword on the right. Huh, I recently saw the monsignor being given a wooden box with that same symbol on it. Oh God, then so it's related! We don't even know what these things are. You got one and nothing's happened to you, right? No, no, no, it could have. It could have, if Tara was not there to wake me up and don't forget about what happened at the rectory to me. Kate, I don't know, I mean maybe the feud with the monsignor's gone to your head? There you go. What if it is Brock? Think about it, the only thing that any of us have in common is Saint Bart's, I mean, I think that you need to call the bishop. You will not talk to the bishop, you will burn in hell for the sinners that you are. Kate, Kate? Sarah. How could you do what you've done? What, what are you talking about? To take the gift of life from within you? How could you? Hello? Kate, it's Father Dalton. Father, Father. Why would Father Brock but at Sarah's house? Sarah's house, oh my God. What's he doing? I don't know, he's just standing in the yard with a whip, he's whipping thin air. The baby, something was wrong with it. With this child. Yes he had a disease, please, leave me alone. Father, he is up to no good, you have to stop him. But he's not doing anything, he's just standing there. Something was wrong, it was sick. Kill it Sarah, kill yourself. No, I don't want to. Please don't make me do this again, please. Do it. I can't. How could you ask me to do something like that? What do I do? Father, get out of the car and ask him, what is he doing there in the middle of the night? No Kate, Kate, he's my superior. Go! No I can't. It was too painful the first time. The baby suffered, I suffered. No more, please have pity. Wait Kate, wait, he's getting in the car and he's leaving, lemme call you back, I'm gonna go and see what's going on, okay? Kate, yeah. I don't think he was doing anything other than praying. Okay, but why Sarah's house, it doesn't make sense, there has to be a connection. I don't know Kate. Did you find a medallion there? No, no, I didn't see one there. Listen Kate, I think I have an idea that I think'll make you feel better. What if we did an impromptu spiritual cleansing at your house? You mean an exorcism to keep the spooks away. Okay, what if, what if the others in the group came over, we could have some food, you know, afterwards and just talk about Jean and James. Yeah, something like that, yeah. Yes, this would be very healing for everyone, I think that's a great idea. Okay. Everyone, let's give Dean a big hand for helping us set up this party. Of course he's up to no good at the moment. Hello. Hey Alice, may I interest you in some of this really nice punch? Come on, have a drink with me to celebrate this fine occasion. If you think you're gonna get me drunk and take advantage of me, Dean, that's definitely not happening. That's no for a drink then? Translation, get me a drink. But she said no. Of course she did. I don't understand women anymore. They say no when they mean yes. Don't get him, Dean, why'd you think he became a priest? Oh come on Father, do you have an opening? Let's discuss it over drinks. Father Dalton, thank you so much for doing this. Oh yeah, well it was your idea too Kate. I think it was just what everyone needed. It's lovely Father. Jean would have appreciated it. Yeah, James would have too Father. I think they both always loved listening to your sermons. You're not gonna get in trouble for this, are you Father? I mean, it's not like it's an exorcism or is it? I don't see Linda Blair anywhere. It's okay Callie, no Linda Blair. Or Max von Sydow. Thank God, I'm not ready for heavy stuff like that. Left my crucifix at home. I needed this. What did you think of the ceremony? It was nice. The question is, was it good for you? Oh for me? Double entendre! You guys are getting along better aren't you? Are we? I suppose so. Tara? Tara what's wrong? Tara what's wrong? Tara, rub her back. Tara what's wrong? - Did she choke or something? - I don't think she's choking. Do you think she swallowed wrong? Somebody do something! I think she needs CPR. Somebody call 911. Tara, breathe for me. Come on Tara, don't die too. Tara's gone! - Who knows CPR? - No, no! We need help. - Oh my God. - Oh my God. We need help. Get her flat. Dean get me sharp pen. 241 Tower Street, that's right. Diane get me a pen, take all the ink out of it. Pen no ink, pen no ink. Here, here, Father Dalton. She's having trouble breathing, I don't know if it's some allergic reaction? Okay, I need to intubate. - Oh no, no. - Oh God Father. No, no, he's cutting her throat. What are you doing? This can't be happening, it can't be happening. Tara, what's wrong, what's happening to you? Hi, I'm back everybody. Marla! Marla. Tara stop it. Oh God, no. Oh God, no. Dean, oh God, no. Alice, I love. Leave her, unclean spirit, in the name of our Lord. What are you doing? Lord, free your servant from the clutches of this demon. Oh yes, oh yes Father, please help me. That's not going to work Father, we're supposed to be on the same team, you traitor. Leave this young woman, demon. Shut the fuck up Father. Tara, this isn't you, Tara, stop doing this, you're hurting people. Stop abomination. What's happening? I don't know Tara, I don't know but Tara it's all right. Oh God. Leave us alone. Whatever you are, just go away and leave us alone. Remove their evils. Remove. Oh man, that's grim. At a party this happened? Hey, has somebody got the rest of this lady? Yeah, I got something for you Kurt. Oh God, thanks Smith. Just when you think you've seen it all. What the hell is going on here? That's some real rage man. Some dinner party gone wrong? Maybe the quiche flopped? No, whatever, something bad set somebody off, that's for sure. You can say that again. I don't think I need to. Bag it and tag it. Got something for you Smith. You're gonna need more ambulances. I'm telling you Detective Swanson, I know what was there... Try to hold still Father. We have to stop the bleeding. It was a demonic possession, the likes of which I have never seen. Demonic possession. Come on Father, that crap isn't real. We all saw it. You mean, all you who ain't dead yet, right? Father, I've got multiple dead bodies but multiple physical means. I don't see anything demonic about it. It's true though, something was controlling Tara. It was the nun. A nun, there was a nun here too? It's a spirit that looks like a nun. Now I've heard everything. Father did you see anything that might resemble a? Jeez, great. No, I mean I didn't see a nun. Well not hallucinating is a good sign Father. How's the wrist? - It hurts like, it hurts. - You have a bad sprain there. Keep the cold pack on it. I remember nothing after that thing clocked me in the head. But Kate has mentioned something about this spirit before. You've seen this sort of thing before Miss Hoser? Not like this. But you have seen the nun before. Yes I have, in my bedroom. In your bedroom? Officer Smith, can you look around for a nun costume? What, a nun costume? I mean, are you serious, you want me to look around for a nun costume? Yes seriously, look for a nun costume, maybe something kinky's going on around here. Okay Detective, a nun costume. What exactly are you trying to say Detective? Man that's in there deep. You know maybe, someone's wearing a nun costume and driving everybody crazy here. You for example! That's horrific. It wasn't me, I had nothing to do with this. In my experience, murder's committed by real people, not ghosts. Hey, that one wasn't so hard. Can you please have some respect, that is my friend who is laying there, God! It wasn't me, things were just flying around. I saw all those things too. That's the same thing the four other survivors said when I interviewed them. Detective, I'm not seeing a nun costume. Well keep looking. I see a priest costume, I actually see a priest sitting right there and it looks similar to a nun costume. Did I say a priest costume? I said a nun costume. Look, I don't know what happened here but I'm gonna find out. Believe you me, I'm gonna find out. I think you'll need a few stitches to close the wound up. Wait here for me. And how are you feeling? I'm okay, I think. Let's check you out, okay? Follow the light with your eyes. Breathe in. Breathe out. I don't think there's anything wrong with you, other than you being stressed out. You don't seem to have a concussion, so I can't explain the blackout. But you might wanna get a CAT scan, maybe it'll show if there's something neurological? Neurological? Great. Keep an eye on her tonight, if she has another episode call us. I won't be staying here tonight. Oh dear. Tara, Tara. I am leaving, we're done. Whoa, what are you talking about? Kate there are dead people in your living room, people are saying that I am the one that did it. No, it wasn't you, it's the nun, it's the... God here we go with the nun again. I know, I know. I don't know how but I am sure that this is your fault. I don't know what is going on in this chaos but maybe it's because you hate yourself and maybe you hate me too. No, no, Tara. No Tara don't go. Please just stay, Tara. Tara, God, Tara! Now we're gonna walk out to the ambulance. Kurt, wanna give me a hand? You got it Jade. Hey Father, let's get you to the ambulance, how's that sound? I know this isn't the right time for this but I feel the need to say it. Don't contact me anymore. Whatever is going on here, it's too much for me. Father. I'm sorry. Father. Well Miss Hoser, I'm done for tonight. I'll see you tomorrow, I have some more questions. Why, do you think I did it? Do you think you did it? Are you responsible for the deaths of your friends? Please go. Can I help you Father? I can't let you in, it's a crime scene. Crime scene, what happened? A woman was found dead inside by her mother. Detective Jones, is that your name? That's correct Father. Tell me what happened here. Father, I really can't say anything, it's an ongoing investigation. I know, please, please, she's a member of my congregation. I can get into a lot of trouble for saying anything but seeing as you're a priest and all. She died of multiple stab wounds to the abdomen. The abdomen, are you sure? Please, please, it's important. Well, I'm sure I'm sure Father, I mean that's what the ME said, stabbed in the stomach. You know, the abdomen. Father, watch out, they're coming through. Father Dalton, what are you doing here? I followed the lights, didn't think they'd lead me here. You knew the victim? She was a member of my congregation. That's a hell of a coincidence, isn't it Father? Can I see her? It's all right, he's her priest let him see, open it up. Oh God, oh no, dear Lord no. Hey, hey, hey, look out there Father. Something of a shock, hey Father? You know your congregation's getting smaller every day Father? Can't be too good for business, can it? Sister of fire, sister of light. Scourge of demons who move by night. A nun, you woke up from a horrible dream to find an evil nun watching you from your closet? Yes, she shrieked at me. Rise. Rise. Rise. Yes, take it. Slit your wrists. Do it, you're a sinner, what you feel makes you one. Yes I am a sinner. Do it. Do it. Do it. Kate? Kate, don't do this. Damn what the church says if it's causing you to hurt yourself. This world is so full of pain and hate that if you can fall in love with one person you're lucky. It doesn't matter who it is, embrace it. Do it. Yes, I can't be ashamed of who I am. I know who you are and you're a monster. You are the enemy of this. Leave this house, leave this woman alone. Now I cast you out of this plane, back to whence you came. Sister Lucret. Father! This is her name. Sister Lucretia de Bonaventure, I invoke your name and cast you down to hell. You have no dominion over me. You've invited me into your heart. No, I never invited you. Father, Father, why, why did you come back? Oh my God, oh my God. You needed me. No, you said it was too much for you. Kate, you believe so strong. Now Kate, don't let anyone find out about this, you understand? They'll blame you. No, no, no, no, I'm sorry. Mother Lucretia de Bonaventure, lead interrogator of the Spanish inquisition. Bonaventure went crazy with blood lust as if possessed, she put whole towns to the torch. The papacy was forced to intervene and had her burned alive. Her body was interred by the inquisition in Rome, along with the sacred whip she would flagellate herself with. Her whip, he has her whip with her blood on it and he's controlling her spirit with it, like some sort of weird blood magic. You want a holy war Monsignor? You've got one. Is there anyone here? What's happening? Well Tara, feeling a little high? Where is it? What did you do to her? Nothing yet. Give me my whip. This is hers isn't it? That bitch, it's got her blood on it and somehow you control her with it. What would happen if I shake this thing at you? I bet you wouldn't like that? No, I bet you have a number of things you need to answer for, Monsignor. Now untie Tara now. Now you see, I can't do that because I'm ready for you, you just showed up a little bit early that's all. Now, give me that whip or I'll cut her throat. Well that would make you a murderer, that righteous nun of yours wouldn't appreciate that now would she? You're just looking at it from the wrong perspective. I could flay all the skin off your bones and bury you in the backyard and I would still be anointed by heaven's tears. I am a superhero of heaven. What did you say to me you fucking bitch? I will fucking kill you and you will burn in the fire of hell with your bitch. You will be fucked mercilessly by the monsters cocks of the devils of hell. I just hope that I get to see it. What is wrong with you, you are supposed to be a man of God and God is not like this. You know nothing about God. God created the world with an explosion. God created diseases that melt children's organs. God created insects that lay their larvae in your skin and then they chew their way out until you die. When are you gonna get it? God is a fucking murder machine. Tara wake up, we gotta go. - We have to go, - Sister of fire, - we have to go now. - sister of light. - Please God, wake up. - Scourge of demons - Yes, yes, there you are. - that move by night. Remove the sinners with thy might. Whip the sinners 'til they bleed bright. Come on Tara, I see you, I see you, I see you, oh God, oh God. Come on, come on. Oh Tara no. No, no! Get away from her you hag! Tara please be okay. I'm okay, I'm okay, please save me. Come on baby, let's go. You're an abomination to God. Kate no! Oh baby. Let's go, let's go. Come on, oh God. We got this, okay? There's stairs over here, go, go upstairs. It's okay, you're gonna be okay, you're gonna make it, you're gonna make it. Hurry, hurry. Oh God. Behind here. Here, here, come on. Look at the blood. Oh my gosh baby. There's so much blood, oh God. Oh God, Kate we have to stop it. Press hard on it. Tara just hold me, just hold me. You're stupid, the inquisition turned on you, on orders of the church. They betrayed you, then they burned you alive at the stake. No, the holy see would not betray me, I have served them faithfully. Why was I burned? You were too good at your job. You were an embarrassment, a liability. The church was using you then and they are using you now. He is using you. I am no mortal's fool. I control you, not the other way around Sister. I do not serve any little man, I serve only God. You are my instrument. Come on baby, come on. Die. You will do as I command. Die. Go, go! Okay go. You're okay. Whore. Tara! I will gut you like the piece of meat you are. Tara. The whip, take it, the whip. Kate, your blood. Burn, burn! You killed so many good people, now die and burn in hell forever. I'll call an ambulance, they'll be able to help you. I love you Tara. Don't go Kate, I love you. I don't wanna live without you. It's okay, you're safe. I'm so sorry I doubted you. There was no doubting ever, all right? Just kiss me. I knew it. I believe Kate.
