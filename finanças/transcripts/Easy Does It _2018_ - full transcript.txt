They have to be focused. You have to really know what you really want to be and what you really want to do. I think... it's just to have love. To have a family. Sir, could you please not do that? I mean, figured getting my picture in the paper. Yeah, I'mma be somebody. - They're going to see. - Two cars for every garage. Hell yes, my friend. Two garages for every house. Hell, that's four cars all day. Oh, a beauty queen. Even a county fair beauty queen. Any kind of beauty queen! It's kind of like hunting a turkey. You got to line up the shot. Man, I'm just trying to keep peace. At the end of the day, everybody deserves life, liberty and... Bam! That's my dream. What's my... You know, man, uh, all anybody's looking for is making something happen for themselves, you know? Just a matter of finding a place you can do that. Step one, make a plan. Step two... Come on now! Quit your yappin' boy! Dream big, see what happens. Ladies and gentlemen, we got a real opportunity here today! Not just the fight of the year but the wager of the century! - Now, I know you got debts, let's make some bets! - Let's do it, yeah! In this corner, we got Scottie The Wildman Aldo! Yeah, and more importantly, in this corner, we got sharp as a tack Lightning Jack! All right, yeah. Bet big or go home, woo! All right, folks, all bets are final! This is for all the chili dogs! Get him again! Get him, get him! Get him, get him, get him! Yeah! Stick to the plan, take the fall! Get him now! Get him while he's down! Oh, he's down! Ladies and gentlemen, it was a knock out! I mean, look! This, this man is dead! - Wait minute, wait a minute! - Somebody call an ambulance! Give him some water! Everybody back off, give him some room. I'm just, I'm just going to go seek help! Hey, hey, get him! Hey! Hey! Did it again, Jackie boy! Yeah, not bad! Hey, where's the cash? Aw, shit! If you think about it, you should be grabbing the cash while they're looking at me. Look, it's nobody's fault you forgot the cash and obliterated my cool plan. We're on to bigger and better things. Hey, I just don't see why I always gotta take the fall. All right, I'm listening. What if next time we do, like, characters? You know, like cowboys and Indians. That's the big time that I'm talking about. Yeah, I like that, but I do feel like you're kind of missing the point though, 'cause I mean, that's just... man, all this, all right, the scams, this, this job, the suspiciously generous loans from the King. That's all just, uh, it's a means to an end is what it is, you see? 'Cause step one, I got my car up and running, which brings us to step two. We just raise a little more money to put some gas money in said car, which brings us promptly on to step three, which is someday, and someday soon, my friend, you and me are going to be. Uh-huh. You know You've been saying that since we were 12 years old, Jack. Except nobody ever gets out of here, do they? Ah, that's not entirely true. My... my mama made it out of here. Yeah, but your mama wasn't drowning in debt to King George. Well. If it ain't my two favorite dishwashers! How we doing, boys? Let me see them winnings! Huh? Well, you know it's a funny thing, Mack... It is a funny thing 'cause I'm going to be able to pay off the King and have enough money left over for the Fourth of July! Get those big old rockets loud as hell! You know what, hell, you boys are invited! We'll get shit-faced and piss of the neighbors! You see uh, uh, about that, Mack, we had like a little bit of an issue with the money. "Sure thing," you told me! "Not to worry, we're gonna double your money!" That's what you said! Well, no, Mack, I believe what I said was... No, I know what you said! You said, "I got a plan, man!" Oh shit, all right, calm down now. - We're gonna pay you back, all right? - That's horse shit! And I'm going to take it out your paychecks! Hey, hey, let's just talk about this! Ain't going to talk your way out of nothing! I'm docking your paychecks for a month, you understand me? You lazy white trash! Hey! I'm a quarter of Apache. Three months! Oh yeah? Goddammit! Man, we can barely afford to eat as it is, man! Well, eat this, you egg sucking, trailer park weasel, ass-licking. Let's take a moment of refuge to... The... the King? Tell you what, folks, if you like a burger, and I know you do... It's her daughter. Get me down, get me down right now! The Mad Dogs have come out swinging in the first, and now lead 1-0. Get me down now. Okay, how do I look? Uh, bad? Blue, darling, how you doing, baby girl? - She's probably here for the car. - Oh, yeah, definitely. Here's the pitch... Ain't no reason to panic, I'm gonna get you your money. Out of nowhere, what a shot! Goddammit. Sons of bitches! - I got something. - Good. - All right, so we get a camera. - Right. And we, uh, wait for tourists to come to town and we take their photo in front of like a tourist attraction. - We sell it back to them for ten dollars. - Come on, man. Why the hell's a tourist going to come here? All right, man, so we drum up tourism first. You know, we do like a... Aw, hell, there's another bridge. Holiday-themed movie theater, right? During the winter we do just Christmas movies. We decorate it, like, icicles in the lobby. Yeah, yeah, we can even sell peppermint popcorn. Yeah, now you're getting it. Maybe a chunky reindeer meat. - What? - Smoked Santa's sausage. I hate Christmas movies. That's... that's something you should know about me, Jack. Wait... what? Nah, Christmas movies are great, man. Full of hope, good tidings and shit. What you got? Dear Jack, if you're reading this, I'm dead. Kiss, kiss, Mama. PS, left you something under that pier. What did she leave you? - Uh, maybe, uh... - buried treasure? What makes you think she left you buried treasure? Because I've been here. San Clemente, California, man. My mom, she took me when I was a kid before she ran off. She told me about how the ships used to sail in and out of there from all over the world carrying, you know, treasures. And that you might could still find one of those treasures to this day if you know where to look. Uh-huh? Uh... You think your mom left us gold coins? I'm just saying. What have we got to lose in finding out? - All right, but just hear me out real quick. - I'm listening. 'Cause I'm following you but, I just got to say, are you really serious right now, man? Or are you just playing a "Jack" on me? What you mean? Of course I'm being serious! What you talking about? California? Yeah, Scottie, I'm going. You gonna come with me? I mean... shit, it's just too far away, Jack. Too far, you say? All right, all we got to do is hop on 59, but then we cut down to ten at Houston, right? And go on these guys. Those might be railroad tracks, but we'll just see when we get there. Then we get on the 45, then we get on the 35 to the 25... We'll be on the beach in 27 hours, baby! - That's good, Jack. - Yeah, yeah. You stick to my plan, Scottie. You'll see, man. This is gonna be our ticket out of this shit hole, man. No more washing other people's dishes. No more futile con jobs. No more getting fleeced by the King, that's for damn sure. And when we get there, man. Five star restaurants and shit, real deal gourmet. They got pasta with shrimp, man! I love shrimps. Granted... could be nothing. Plain old nasty pasta. But if it is, man. It's all I'm saying. What if it is? Oh, shit, we're late! - Hey, Scottie, we're late, man. - Ow. - No, Jack. - Late for work, man. Jack, Jack, Jack. Already called in for us. Said we ain't coming in on account of us being millionaires and all. Billionaires, maybe. Oh, Lord, here comes Jooly Booly Rogers, that brutal force of nature. Who'd you tell what now? - Work, man. - This is game four against the Montgomery Mad Dogs. And as you know, to stay alive, these Outlaws got to pull out a win here in game four. Ah, I said, "Jack's Mama left us some inheritance money, so you can take them dishes and shove them up your ass." It's great, man, great. You know who owns that diner and the whole goddamn town, huh, yeah? The King, man! Oh, shit. Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on! All right, go ahead. Good morning, Blue. What's going on with you, girl? The King want a word with you. Yeah, definitely. Well, you know, as matter of fact, I was going to come see King George first thing tomorrow. Save you the trouble. Hey, you know what, let me, uh, put on a shirt and I'll be right with you. Let me get my toothbrush! Jack, where's my toothbrush? Dammit! Hey, hey, hey, watch my car, man! Where are we going, fellas? This is all a misunderstanding. And where's your bags? I was told we were taking a trip. - We love trips. - No, we're... - A trip? You heard what now? - Who told you that? Fire her up. Shit. So y'all don't know nothing about no gold coin, - wild goose chase? - No, no. - I don't know about that. - Geese? No. Turn right up there. And y'all weren't thinking about skipping out on your obligations to old King Georgie? Come on, we been pay... ow! You're just trying to fleece us like you do the whole town. Damn, Blue! Put your seatbelt on. - She's right. - Scottie and I, we got an opportunity. - Turn left up there. - Uh, yes, ma'am. Hey now, look. We're not trying to skip out on any sort of anything, all right? It's just that we, we got an opportunity to pay you back, you know? And that's why we got to go and get it, me and Scottie. You know? So... Use your goddamn turn signal! Yes, ma'am! Uh, but me and Scottie both got to go, so... Pull over here a second. Let me out, come on. - I see you! - Get, lady! - Why you running? Get over here! - Please don't.

Save you the trouble. Blue here. Blue is gonna go get it for ya. - I'll hang onto your car in the meantime. - No, no... And that's a "King George Guarantee." Meanwhile... you can just cool your heels with my friends here. But wait. Come on out, fellas. What's that you been saying about beaches, Jack? Oh, you mean, uh, "75 degrees year round, color TV in every room"? I hear the waves already. - Oh, shit! - Oh, shit indeed, Jack! It's a civil matter, man! It's not like she'll call the cops on us. Yeah, that ain't what I'm worried about right now! It's not even her car, okay? For the record, she, she's the crook! - Yeah, crooked as a crocodile! - Less teeth too. Shit, woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Hey, man, you and me, right? - Yeah. Yeah! - All the way? Look, we drive straight though, man, we can hit the beach by Monday. You know what that is, right? - That's the day of Independence, baby. - That's right! We'll be watching the rockets over California skies. - So, they got like a white wine sauce on there. - Uh-huh, uh-huh. - With butter or cream, or something. - So, so, white wine and dairy? - Yeah, yeah, that's how they do it. - All right. I love good cream. - Yeah, and lemon. They got lemon on there. - Oh, lemons? - Yeah. - Damn. It's very well balanced. Oh, and that shrimp, man! Big old juicy, butterfly... Jack, I feel like I'm pushing all the weight, man. - Oh, put your back into it. - My back's in it. Come on, come on. Hell! - That could be good enough, huh? - Yeah, it'll reach. Whoo! - Dine and dash? - Don't know that we got much of a choice. Yes, yes indeed. It don't pump. It ain't coming through. - Oh, I got to do this now. - Yeah, you just kind of... And then, um, I heard before you kind of have to - put your weight on it. - Oh, you're like squeezing it out, huh? Yeah, kinda like that. - Hey, guys! - What? - It's pre-pay! - What's that now? You pay first and then you get the gas. - Yeah, we already know that. - Yeah, no, - thanks for the tip, amigo. - No problem! We ain't stupid! Shit! - Real pickle. - You know, I bet his car's full of gas. Yeah, stupid pre-pay! Who thought of that? You know, it's 'cause there ain't no trust in this world anymore. Oh, that's good. Yep, that's good. When I'm good, I'm good, man. I don't know what to tell you. - What you got? - Oh, right, here's the plan. All right. - When I give you the signal... - Mm-hmm. ...you get the car running. All right. That was it? Oh, all right. Thanks for explaining it to me! Morning, beautiful. Uh, gimme some unleaded, darling. - How much do you want? - Oh, just fill her up. I love that jumper you've got on. What's that, Egyptian cotton? Egypt? - Well, you... - Uh-oh, someone's out of mayonnaise packets. I'm just joshing, I'm fine, thanks. Say, ma'am, now, I know this is a little out of the ordinary but I wanted to... That'll be $12.67. Righty-oh, let's see here. I just got to... You go on ahead of me, kimosabe. No, take your time. I'm in no hurry. Okay, uh, what was that? - 12.67. - 67. 12.67. Here we are in game five and aw, jumping Jupiter, here comes Rogers from the bullpen, with the devil in his eyes. It's not looking good for our boys. God, this is embarrassing. I left my wallet in the car. Would you believe that? So, I'm going to go find my friend, get my wallet, and then return to... Oh, Scottie. - Hey, Jack. - It's my friend. Thank God you're... - We got to go. - Why, what's up? I'm calling the police. Terribly sorry, ma'am, we're going to need this one on credit. - Thank you, have a nice day! - Drop it. Oh! Don't shoot. - Please, don't shoot! - Don't shoot! - Don't shoot! - Hold still, sonny! Hold still, I can get them! Don't shoot, no! No, don't shoot! Hold still! Don't shoot! No! No, no, no, ow! Rogers, as cool as a be-bopping beatnik, shaking off calls, closing in for the kill. And whoa, whoa, there's Chili Bowl Davis creeping off third. And here's the wind up but wait a second, Davis is going for it! He's stealing home! And Rogers rockets the ball to home plate... Holy Hades, they did it! After a nasty crash... Oh my god, oh my god, please! What's going on? Please call the cops, call the cops. Lady! It ain't easy. Come here, you're okay. - Hell, no. - You got to grab it, you know? You just got to get up in there and grab it by the horns and if you don't, it's going to pass you by, I think. Are you set? Are we doing the interview first? - Interview first. - Oh, I didn't know that. Can you tells us your name, and where you’re from? Blue Eyes Montgomery, I'm from Aberdeen. Blue Eyes, what’s your occupation? Do you really want to know? They ain't people, they ain't real people. Nobody's real people, really. They're just running around using each other. And I'm there to clean them up, that's what I'm there to do. Ocean City may have squeaked out a victory today but they... I listen to it more now. I like to... I like to hear it so I can see it in my mind more. You know, more fun that way. Make it any way you want. This is unit 16. Looks like the suspects are headed west across those railroad tracks. That gon' be fun. Come on, guys, let me out of here! - Jesus of Nazareth, Scottie! - Well, what was I supposed to do? - Not that, man! - Hey, man, it worked, didn't it? So, uh, uh, thank you, Scottie. Oh, you're welcome, Jack! He was pissing his pants, man! That was great! Yeah, it was great. All right. - Yeah? - Let's, let's just dump him out. No, man, he'll rat us straight to the cops! - Okay, all right, man, it's fine. - All right. We'll drive to the middle of nowhere. We'll dump him out there and by the time he can be any trouble for us, we'll be, you know, across state lines. All right, man, but let's not be too hasty, you know? I mean, dude's probably rolling in cash. - Whoa, whoa! - Hey, you started this train, Jack. I'm just trying to keep it rolling for us. I mean, look, it's either this, or if you'd like, we could rob some more gas stations. - No, we're not robbing anything. - Hey, shit, you're the boss, man. - He has got a tie. - It's a hell of a tie, Jack. - Okay. - Yeah? Uh, if we borrow the money and then we pay him back when we get there, - it's not a big deal. - Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. But look, we got to play the part, we got to act tough, we can't Mickey Mouse this. What you mean Mickey Mouse, son? I got this, look! Ah! Yeah, yeah, no, maybe, like, just take it down a little bit. - I wanted to scare him. - Yeah, yeah, but there's a certain subtle civility to what we're doing here, you know? - All right, all right. - Yeah, yeah, maybe split the difference. - What you want me to do? - Just like... - Mmm. - That's not what... Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What did I tell you, huh? - What did I tell you, huh? - Do what we say! - Come on, come on, let's see! - Okay! Collin Hornsby. You know something, Collin? The first time I laid eyes on you, the first time I saw you, I said, there goes a cool guy. A cool guy who ain't going to do nothing stupid, remember? - He said that to me, Collin. - That's right, right, Collin? You're a cool guy who ain't going to do nothing stupid, right? - Huh, huh? - Yeah. - Yeah? Say yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Wakeman, Arizona. Now, what's in Wakeman, Collin? I mean, what's in Wakeman, Collin? My fiancee, who'd be worried, so you should let me go. - Oh! - What was that again? - What did he just say to us? - Again? Go ahead, say that again, Collin. Back up. - I said, you should let me go. - Uh-uh. He said fiancee. Collin, you see, I'd hate to have to show up in Wakeman, Arizona, - and make some trouble for your little fiancee. - What, no, you... - Don't talk right now. - As we've established, Collin, you're a cool, smart guy, and as such, I'm sure you can appreciate the opportunity viable of a well-timed loan, yeah? - Yeah. Wait what? - Say yeah. We want your money, Collin, where's it at? - He's broke! - New plan! Well, look, man, we really appreciate your time! I wish you the best of luck, bon voyage! Good riddance! All right, so what's the deal, Jackie? I mean, the way I see it, we just keep on robbing places. - We're not thieves. He's kidding, inside joke. - How you doing? So, here's the plan. I go in, I do my thing. I make the pitch. We're going to pay them back when we find the treasure, right? It's an IOU. And, look, we're good people, they'll help us out. Of course, from time to time, uh, they may not buy what we're selling and it might be necessary to, you know, play the part. Play the part. Give us the money! Yeah! Your idea is just my idea. - No, no. - Kind of. I don't feel like you're listening, man. You see, what I'm going to do is I'm going to write down the, you know, address of wherever we go. - Uh-huh. - Write down what we took and let them know that I'm going to be sending it back to them. It's not stealing if we pay them back when we get where we're going. That's just a... - Sure. - Forced loan, right? It's kind of, it was like my idea, but then just, you know, more lying and dishonesty. That makes sense, yeah. What if they're packing? Yeah, about that... Sure was easier having Collin around. That's something. All right, here we go. Okay. - Oh, come on. - Collin! Buddy, hey! - Buddy, it's us! - We just want to hang out, man! You're making it harder for yourself, Collin. Come on! You can't run from a car, Collin! - I can try! - Where you going? Look, we've got a mutually beneficial proposition for you! You're making things more difficult than they got to be, man! - Stop it, no! - Collin! - Leave me alone! - This doesn't have to be hard, Collin! - No, leave me alone! - You want a water? I got a cup of water in the car. Come on, man, Collin. You look tired, man, get in the car. Not again! All right, Collin. Say, what line of work you in, man? No, no, no, we don't need to be talking to him, getting all buddy buddy, and you're making friends with him? Bosco and Bosco. - Oh, okay! - I work at a catalog. I take the calls and then manage the sales. Catalog man, that's, that's good business! - Shut up, it's not good business! - I'm just trying to grease the wheels, all right? You catch more flies with honey than vinegar. - Oh, no, no. - I'll tell him about the thing. Yeah, come on, let's tell him about the treasure. - No. - Yeah, look. Collin, you ever been to California, man? - No. - Well, you see, Collin, they got this place way out west called San Clemente. Great beaches, beautiful sand, crystalline waters. They got something else that makes it special, Collin. - Do you know what that is? - No. Buried treasure, hidden loot just for us, man. - Golden coins, Collin! - Hundreds of them, Collin. - Probably thousands. - Possible millions, Collin. Possibly! That's why I'm glad we're friends 'cause we want to share it with you. - Our best friend. - Now, of course, getting there, we're going to need a little bit of help. So, what we're asking you, Collin, is are you ready to be part of the big time, huh? Jack and Scottie and their hostage gang. - We'll work on the name. - Little Buddy Gang. Yeah, that's good. Jesus, man, are you crying? - No, you can't cry in here. - No, Collin, man. There's no need for you to be crying. No, we're not like... we're just doing a thing, we're playing. We're doing a thing right now. We're just like you, man. We're regular guys. We're just like you. I can't believe this is happening! All 'cause I had to pee and so, I couldn't just stop. I had to keep... All because I went to the stupid Pump N Stump. I had to pee! You two stupid heads grab me and you held a knife to my fricking throat! That's dangerous, I eat through that throat! All right, I'm not mean, I'm not a criminal! I'm tired and I'm hungry! Trash, you're just human trash, and you're not letting me eat and you're not letting me leave! I could've brought the cheese poofs with us! You guys are like, "No, you don't get to eat!" And now, I'm starving. What do you think is going to happen? I'm going to give you a million dollars? I don't have a million dollars. I belong at the Sizzler having a baked potato and... We all like baked potatoes, man. We're the same. My whole family fucking loves baked potatoes. I don't care about you and your family! I just want two things! To leave and to eat! I'll do them in either order! All right. You done, man? Yeah. Welcome to Frostop. Can I take your order? All right, fellas. Let's do a... I'm going to go with a chicken on a stick, uh, fried pickles. Uh... - Okay. - ...two orders of fries, one with the cheese, - one with the gravy. - All right, all right. Look, man, I asked for a milkshake, he got fried pickles. If he's getting fried pickles, I want a milkshake and fried pickles! Collin, I think we're going to have to downsize that order a bit so we can make it to the next town. - But I'm hungry. - But you're not going to finish all that, - so just pick one. - All right, then, uh, double hamburger... No, man. Just get a single hamburger like the rest of us. Fine, single hamburger with cheese... I'm not made of money, Collin. I tell you what. Uh, we're going to go and do three of the, uh... oh, look at that, cheese sandwiches. Everyone like cheese? Three cheese sandwiches. - Yum. - And, uh... - one cheese sandwich all day. - One cheese sandwich! Water. Uh, large water. - Anything else? - Yeah, call the cops! - I'm a hostage... - Nope, no, no. That's got it! All right, pull up. Oh, like they'd do it. - You look really cool. - You think so? Yeah, like... no, really, really cool. - You think it's going to scare them? - Well, yeah. - Whoever is in there? - It's definitely distinctive. - They'll remember you. - Guys, we can't do this! - Stealing is wrong. - Yeah, yeah, wrong. That's cool, man. Come on, Collin, don't let your tribe down. - It's not all about you. - Look, Collin, it's very simple, man. You just go in there like regular. You just shop around, like regular, and then we're going to come in and do the hostage thing. - Like regular, Collin. - Yeah! - No, guys, they'll kill me! - Look, they might kill you, but if you don't go in there, I definitely will. Oh, Collin, you know what? I believe in you, and, uh, I know you'll do the right thing. Boop! Or I'll kill you. ♪ That famous day in history the men of the seventh Cavalry ♪ ♪ Went riding on ♪ ♪ And from the rear a voice was heard ♪ ♪ A brave young man with a trembling word ♪ ♪ Rang loud and clear ♪ ♪ What am I doing here? ♪ ♪ Please, Mr. Custer ♪ ♪ I don't want to go ♪ ♪ Hey, Mr. Custer ♪ ♪ Please don't make me go ♪ ♪ I had a dream last night ♪ ♪ About the coming fight ♪ ♪ Somebody yelled, attack ♪ ♪ And there I stood with an arrow in my back ♪ Um, listen, listen, ma'am.

I'll admit I've never eaten a car full of food but... - There you go. - That's what I'm trying to say! I think America is the land of freedom for anyone. Getting out of small towns, getting to the big city. I'm a firm believer in hard work. If you work hard, you'll, you'll be able to get everything that you want. As long as you pull up your bootstraps. I guess I kind of think that's bullshit. Dreamers and schemers. No, I'm a doer. I'm a taker. The American Dream is our prerogative, you know, to, to, to manifest our destiny, you know? Uh, uh, uh. Make it happen for yourself. I had a dream a couple weeks ago that I was, like, in a claw machine and I was one of the bears and, like, my father was not grabbing me. I don't know what that meant but. Don't be afraid to give up and start a new dream.

When I was a kid, I was real afraid of the water 'cause all the creeks were ever full of cottonmouths and shit. - Snakes. - Yeah. So, this one time we went on a real deal, you know, picket fence type of family vacation, beach trip. - San Clemente! - Yeah, that's right. And, uh, you know, we got out to the beach, and it was beautiful but I just... I wouldn't go in. I was too scared. So... On the very last night, she came and got me out of bed, took me beyond the boardwalk, under a pier. And we're standing there, we're looking at the water and, uh... you know, sure enough, there was a little, a golden glint in the water, in the surface. Snake! No, a coin presumably, uh. And so, I'm looking at it, just wide-eyed. And she's looking at me looking at it. And so, my mama says to me, "Well... have you got the balls or haven't you?" Well... did you? Did you have the balls? I, uh, got in halfway and froze up, nearly drowned. - Got right in over my head. - Yeah, he's kind of got a knack for that, Collin. But, uh, you know, she scooped me out, obviously. Sounds like a great mom. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you know, she left us the next summer, so maybe jury is still out on that one but, uh... Woo!

At least you could of put some pants on first. Are you uncomfortable with my masculine nudity? It's just the nudity, it's not... Okay, allowances. - Uh, allowances. - Wait, I should go get the facepaint first - before we do this. - No, man, no. Look, we're... playing it straight, man. We've got plenty. Here.

I'll be up front, don't worry, guys, I got this. - Officer. - We can explain everything. I got them. You all are stupid! Don't it make a jackrabbit spit in a bulldog's face. What do we have here? In the flesh. The Star Spangled Bandit and The Turkey whatever... No, man. Apache Warrior. If you can call me Apache... Shut up! You all are pathetic. You got see no evil, speak no evil, and stupid.

I'm sorry about everything. - It's okay. - No, it's not! - No, it's not okay! - No, no, Jack, it was a good dream. I'm sorry they caught us but we're going to die in prison together. We're not going to prison, Collin. We're going to die in prison. We're definitely going to prison. Yeah, your dead mom would be proud of you. - I think so, too. - Yeah, she's smiling from wherever she's buried. Hey, I think we can get out of these handcuffs. - Mm-hmm. - Use your feet. - We are at 38 and Main. - You all aren't magicians. - No, you'll make things worse! - Collin, use your feet. Nope, I don't need no backup. I don't need no backup. Owens, could you repeat that? No, I said I'll be back there in about two shakes of a lamb's ta... Two shakes of a lambs tail. Two shakes of a what? I'll be back in two shakes of a lamb's tail. Owens? You, you... and you. I ain't supposed to talk to strangers, so I reckon you can get. Go! Go on! Owens, come in four-two-seven, over. And now, Jooly Booly Rogers, the Mad Dogs' star pitcher, finally gets his turn at bat, and he smells blood. His alligator eyes flashing as he squares up to the mound. The wind up, here comes the pitch. Into outer space, whoa! Yes, friends, it is out of here! Oh, geez. As we wrap up the eighth, this could be the end of the road for our hometown heroes. I heard you like fireworks, Jack. Me too. Back when I was used to play ball, they used to bust so close over my head. I could feel the heat. That's all I wanted... was for Ma to say good game. That's what them fireworks meant! - Hello? - I got them, Ma. Put him on. Jack? Poor, stupid Jack. You got a price on your head higher than a blue ribbon piggie, and I'm going to be the one that brings you in to slaughter. If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. If you need help, hang up, and then dial your operator. Hey, you! Don't, don't do it! Oh, no. No, no, no. There you is little cricket. All nice and sweet. Why don't you put that gun down... before I rip your legs... Scottie, you okay? Got to get Jack out of here. Jack, wake up! Wake up, Jack! You got to wake up. You got to wake up, Jack. You got to. Don't die. Don't die, you got to wake up. And so, for one final game, the Outlaws... Where we going, fellas? And where are your bags? We love trips. You and me, man. San Clemente, San Clemente! ♪ There's plenty of gold in world we're told ♪ ♪ On the banks of San Clemente ♪ Well... I don't, I don't really know if it's for everybody. You know, I don't know if everybody can really go for it. Sometimes you just can't. Don't quit, don't get stuck. No matter what anybody tells you, keep trying. Watch your back, you know what I'm saying? It's a crazy world out there. Some girls just ain't pretty enough. It just ain't in their heritage. Gas shortages are keeping folks off the roads. The cost is too high. No one wants to leave their home. America, founded on Westward expansion has gone and over expanded itself. Too little jelly over too much toast. And here's our weather report... - Where are we, man? - Outside Santa Fe. - Did you kill her? - She's still out there. Got this though. - Oh! - That's a sweet piece of metal, Collin. So, we're friends, right? - Collin! - Uh, yeah, no, man, we're really... - We're best friends, Collin. - Yeah, all right, so I got to thinking last night, I had some time to think. And you know, you guys have really put me through hell this whole time. I mean, all the hold ups, the hostages, the knife. I mean, I'm going to get fired over this, that's for sure. I shot that girl. My shoes, my shoes are really nasty now, you know? And all the while, I have to think, you know, what's happening? Am I doing something wrong? Am I making these choices that lead to these situations? Am I letting this happen? So, I think it's time we do something different. You going to kill us? We're going to Wakeman, boys. My man. So, uh, Wakeman, huh? That's interesting. You never really told us what happened with you and your old lady. No, no, no, no, no, I'm a private person and we're keeping that private. Case closed, no way. All right. And so she says, to me, she says, "I'm moving to Arizona. I want you to move with me." - Go with her! - But I had a good job, you know? - Oh! - I mean, catalogs is good business. You said it yourself! Catalogs is good business! You dumb son of a bitch! Collin, she loves you, man. Bang! Is that it? You think that's funny? Bang, bang, bang! Okay, all right! Okay, okay, good joke. Look at the old Apache Warrior, crying like a baby. The Baby Pavo! Dying ain't much of a living, boy. Round here, due process is a bullet. We deal in lead, friend. Aw, hell. They ID'd us. - What? - Yeah. Uh, hostage identity still unknown. You're good, man. What did it say about me? Uh, "Scottie Aldo, 20s, indeterminate race, uh, serial offender." Come on, man. Me! - Yeah. - "Scottie Aldo." I got my name in the papers! It's the big time, Jack. That's all we need. Go on, Collin, pick them up. All right, but only because I want to pick them up. Hey, Jack, check this out. This one goes here and the big bottle goes on the big rock. Don't shoot him in the... Scottie, man. I seen a bird! He looked like he was coming at you, so I was going to shoot him. - Don't shoot me! - All right, now bend over. Hello? Great thundering Christ Almighty! They was mean, they shot me, they did. Well, then next time, you shoot them back. You hear me? Hello? Ma, I can't sleep no more. Oh, Blue. You want a story? Yeah.

We need cop cars out, we need road blocks, we need a car at every gas station this side of Mexico. Sure thing. All right, all right, all right. Let's see, let's see, let's see. Uh, rack my brain, rack my brain. Come on, buddy, you got this. I spy something white. All right, is it, uh, light and fluffy? - Yeah. - Is it a cloud? That was quick, Collin. Well, you know, you're not very good at this. My turn. I spy with my little eye something, that's trouble, police. Whoa, stop the car! Okay, we should probably turn around. Oh, no, we should definitely. All right, I'm just going to back it up. Technically no one guessed police barricade, so I still won that round. All right, so what, we wait it out or just go back the way we came? There's no going back, man. She's coming for us, we're trapped. Let's go to Mexico. - I know Collin's down. - I don't like nachos, You do like nachos. I do not like nachos. Why do you keep saying... Guys, if we go into Mexico as wanted men, there's no coming back. That's the point, Jack! Why would we? We could be infamous banditos, man! Butch and Sundance-style! We'll go straight through. What, like a blaze of glory? Slow and steady, plain sight. They've seen our faces. They know who we are. Not Collin. - Oh, guys, I don't, I don't know about that. - No, I know. And even if I knew about that, I mean, they know the car! I got a plan. Oh, wait, Collin, give me a cigarette real quick. Oh, yeah, I'll be right back. He ain't coming back. Okay, you can do this. You got this. You're just going to drive up to them and you're going to say, "Hey, I'm Collin." And they'll be like, "Oh, I'm a police officer." And then they'll ask for your ID and you'll give it to them. Anything gets into trouble, you can handle this, Collin. Don't throw up. Whatever you do, don't throw up on them. - Give them hell, man. - No! Don't give them hell, just be cool. Just shut up! - Howdy. - Uh, howdy. License. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I have that. I, I have my... just got to... It's in here. Here you go. - Pretty far from home. - Oh, yeah, um. Uh, got a lady in Wakeman. Um, everything, uh, everything all right? Everything all right for you? Yeah, no, it's nice. - A little hot. - Say, Ed! You got to pen? - All right then, drive safe. - You too. Just gun it, man! Just gun it! We got a problem, wait a second! - Shit, shit. - Put your hands on the wheel! - Okay. - Put your hands on the wheel, right now! Drop it! Drop it! What are you doing? No! What the hell? Goddammit, dude! No, what is this? This was not the plan! - You said gun it, Jack! - That's not what gun it means! Sir, if I said you gun it, you would think? What would you think? What would you think I meant? - Pull out the gun, man! - No, nobody thinks that! - If I... - Guns and keys, if you please! - Guns and keys! - Jack, it was a little misleading. - It was not misleading! - Everybody knows that gun it... - It was very misleading! - I'm a innocent hostage, by the way, officer, and I put my hands on the wheel like you said. - Toss them, toss them! - Okay, I'm going to toss them. - All right. - There you go. Boys, you just been bamboozled by the one and only, Apache Warrior! Whoa, why are you still doing that? All right, Apache Warrior, I'm giving you my gun. - Come on, come on! - Don't do it, Ed. - Don't do it, Ed. - I'm giving him my gun. Ed, don't do it. Dammit, Ed! Glad you're laughing, man. Glad you think that was funny. - You all right? - Hell, yeah, I'm all right, Jack! - Woo! - You all right, man? I'm good. Oh, shit, oh, shit! Look, it went in one end and out the other. In one end and out the other! We can fix it, Jack! We just plug up the hole, that's it! What? We got to get him to a hospital. If we go to a hospital right now, they're going to find us! Guys, guys, I'm fine. I "deal in lead," remember? Watch, I can... Nope, nope, nope. Look at this guy, he's like a fountain! I'm just going to, I'm just going to take a little nap. No, stay awake, man! - Hey, hey, Collin. - Wakeman? Hey, there's my guy! Hey, buddy, we're going to get you to the next town. Hey... Jack. Hey. We're going to get you to a hospital. They're going to get you patched up, all right? You're going to be spic'n'span for your big day with Bohlina. - Jack. - What? I'm glad I had to pee at the Pump N Stump. Hey, hey! Help us! Can somebody help us? Think he's going to be all right? I don't know. Damn. I'm going to miss that guy. He got blood all over his tie. - Hell of a tie too. - Hell of a tie. What the hell was that, man? I was just cleaning up your mess, Jack. I didn't hurt anyone. Yeah, man, people got hurt. It wasn't my plan. Never is. Wasn't Collin's plan either. Hey, you know, if you don't like the plan, you don't have to come along for the plan, man! You can get out anytime, man! Yeah, you know what, just g... Yeah, you know what, screw you, man. You don't get no gold, or shrimp or... or nothing. There's nothing there, man. Shrimp pasta sounds nasty anyway. Hey! Hey! Fuck! Maybe next year? There's always next year? Well, fuck you. Good things just don't happen. I don't know who told you that. Your dreams ain't never going to come true. No, 200 years from now, nobody is going to know who you were. And someday, you're going to wake up... and you're going to realize that you are a fuck up. I don't know, it's like... it's like, you roll the dice... you pay the price. Nothing comes free. Nothing comes free in this world. Oh, daggum! Looks like it's over before it started. What a shame. What? You win. I want to end this. Well, Jack! I am in the presence of real celebrity! You know what a goddamn honor it is to be talking to you, Jack? Look, you can have whatever you want, all right? You want, you want money, I got money for you. You want my car? You can have my car. I want you, Jack. On a platter. Well, uh, pardon me for saying so but that's no way to make a deal. No. Oh, you stupid, dumb, son of a bitch. You don't know, do you? We got your friend. He was trying to knock over a bank. Luckily, little Blue answered the call before the coppers could. So, this is what we're going to do. You are going to drive and meet Blue one mile into the desert off of Exit 70. You get Scottie. I get you. And Blue... gets the gold. One hour, Jack. Drive safe. Grab your grills and granny too, folks! It's clear skies for America's birthday here in sunny Southern California. The firework show starts up behind Veterans Memorial Airfield at sundown. In national news, after a bungled bank job, authorities say they're closing in on the notorious crime duo known as the Star Spangled Bandit and the Apache Warrior. The fate of their hostage remains unknown. Well, folks, that's all from Breezy Bob McKee. Uh, all right, uh, Jack Buckner. I was born in Buckatunna but I live in Aberdeen now, Mississippi. Number one thing is to know what you're doing, man. If you don't have a plan, you got nothing, uh. Number two thing is to stick with it. Number three is to find the folks who are going to help you along the way. When I was a little kid, I just figured I had to be a mechanic like my pop, you know? Because I didn't think I had any other shot. But the fact of the matter is this, a man can do whatever he pleases to do. Think anyone can achieve the dream? No, it's easy, man. You just got to have the balls. Why'd you come back, Jack? Bank robbery, huh? Did you clean up? - While they were closed. - Oh, shit. That's actually a pretty good idea. How'd you do? I couldn't get in. Oh, closed. Shot out every one of them windows though. Looks like it's time, boys. All right, Blue, all right. Square deal. You get me, Scottie goes free. No, Jack. I'm going to shoot you, I is. And it's going to be fun too. Always wanted to be a pitcher, I did. Ain't it funny how I became a catcher instead? Strike one, you stole my Ma's money and skipped town. Strike three, Jack. You talk too much. I said there were a lot of them damn windows, Blue! Woo, that was smooth, man! She's out of there! Who's the umpire now, Blue? That was it? Come on, boys! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Get it! Go! Woo! And check out Jooly Booly on the mound, he is spitting mad! Here's the pitch and oof! Whizzes right by Pops McGee. A little too close for comfort. Oh, that's strike one. And the pitch, low and outside. He got him, strike two. It's all been fun and games until now. Rogers winding up, here he goes. Rockets the ball over the plate. A swing and a miss, two outs. We're going to die! I know! But maybe if we don't want to, I had a thought! - Okay! - Like a plan, Jack. If we want to do things my way for once. Okay. Okay? Okay. - And when I count to four... - Four? Why not three? - It's my plan Jack, I like four! - All right, fine, just hurry, Scottie. Go, go, go, go! Ocean City still down by two. Two outs, and all eyes are on Davis. This could be the impossible Cinderella story. Do it. A mad dash for home! Chili Bowl Davis rounding second. - The ball is scooped! - One! Davis is going to go for it! He's nuts, he's rounding third now but here comes the ball! Whoo, come on, boys! Two! On a collision course with the catcher! Three! Four. Did they get him? Did the catcher hang onto it? He is... ...out, out. Aw, Jesus, and the outlaws lose. Come on out, fellas! And Rogers is getting a hero's ovation. Living legend, living legend. Christ, it's hot today. It's a lot of heat. Well. Here they come. Go get us one of them good spots at the beach, Jack. I'm gonna go lose them. No, no, man, I'll lose them. You go, all right? I'll fight you for it. Loser takes the fall. Come on. Apache Warrior squares up with him. One, one, two! That was a hard hit. Here he comes again! He's a maniac! He's crazy! Good hit, good hit! One, one, two! Oh, wait, he's shook. Lightning Jack sees his opening! Apache Warrior isn't ready. The hit, here it comes! And the hit! You got me. I guess I got to go take the fall now. I'm going to go get my face in them papers. It's going to look good too. And you, you go get your shrimp pasta! Pull over, stop the vehicle.
