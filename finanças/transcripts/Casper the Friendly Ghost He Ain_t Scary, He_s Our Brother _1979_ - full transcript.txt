Joveas, carmelita, you two do what the others tell you to do, ok? Ok. Ok, Mr. Duncan. Well, I guess we're all set. Let's move 'em out! Mr. Duncan. What is it, carmelita? I'll share my candy, cookies, and apples with you. Thank you, dear. Just have a good time. [Kiss] Come on, you guys. We're goin' trick or treating! Oh, boy!

I just think there's more to life than going around scaring people. I just think there's more to life than going around scaring people! Hah hah hah hah! Ooh hoo hoo ha ha! Gee, look at those expensive costumes! Wow! Never mind the costumes. Look at all that candy, fruit, and cookies. Oh, I didn't know there was that much good stuff in the whole world! Oh, boy! Let's get some. Be polite now and only take one. [Buzz] All: Trick or treat! You're not from this neighborhood. So? I suggest you try closer to home. But we don't have a home. [Slam] Don't worry, kids. We'll do better at the next house. I hope so. Gee, I don't see the others anywhere. Here's my chance. Ha ha ha. Casper thought he'd given US the slip. Ha ha ha! Let's go down and give him the slip-up. Sooner or later, he's gotta get the hang of this ghost business. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! I'll try this place. Harry: Ha ha ha. All together now... Lift! [Moo?] [Ring] Trick or treat, ma'am. Oh, my! Clem! Hey, that's a pretty good trick, Sonny. How'd you do it? It's easy for US gho-o-sts! Ha ha ha! Both: Aah! Ghosts! All: Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Hey, you're doing great, kid. Where we goin' next, huh? This is our night to howl. I'm not going to help you scare anyone else. I'm going home! Come on. Have some fun! Ha ha ha! Oh, come on! All: ♪ a-haunting we will go ♪ Children: Trick or treat. Ok, gang, we'll go in as soon as they leave. Here they come. You first, carmelita. [Engine starts] Boy, we sure are gettin' off to a good start. We are? I guess I was crazy to think I could come out and have a good time tonight. Hey, kid! Hmm? Don't give up so easily. We haven't had much luck so far tonight either. But we're not quittin'. Why don't you come along with US? Gee, thanks! I'd like to, but I think there's something I ought to tell you. I'm not wearing a costume. I'm a real ghost. Aw, come on. There's no such thing as areal ghost. Really, I'm Casper the friendly ghost. Look! All: Ooh! Wow! A ghost? I can fade off and on... And fly! All: Wow! Gee whiz! Golly! Ooh! And I can go through things. Well, aren't you afraid of me? I like you, Casper. Even if youare a ghost. Hee hee hee. [All laughing] [Mocking] I like you, Casper, even if youare a ghost. Hee hee hee. Ehh, how disgusting. That mixed-up Casper's going to make US the laughingstock of the town. And on Halloween, too. What do you keep looking back for, Casper? The other ghosts are out scaring people tonight, dirk. I think they may be following US. Can they do anything to hurt US, Casper? No, all they can do is scream and screech. Then we're not afraid of them, are we, gang? All: No! You all trick or treat, and I'll try to keep them from butting in. Ok, Casper. Let's go, gang. We'll share with you, Casper. Neh, what's the plan, Harry scary? Well, how diddly-doo. Look who's here. Ah, slummin', Casper, or have you decided to straighten up and fright right? Ha ha ha! I came to ask you to leave these kids alone. This is the one night of the year that they get to go out and have a good time and get some candy and apples and-- aw, gee, Casper. You're breaking my heart. Look, kid, gettin' scared is part of Halloween. If you want to bother them, you'll have to do it over my dead body. Oh, boy! Here we go again. Get him, screech! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha! Hoo hoo! Don't you just love it? Hey, come on, fellas. Yeah, hang in there, Casper. Ha ha ha! Hoo hoo hoo hoo! Ha ha ha!

Thank you, ma'am. Well, I never! Uh--uh, I never neither. The very idea! Takingallthe treats! Oh! Here! Thank you. [Stammering] Wh--stop it! What--oh! Ohh! You will be sorry you did this! But--but-- we didn't! There must be some mistake, ma'am. Those couldn't have been my kids. [Hollering] I'm sorry I couldn't get loose in time to stop them. It isn't your fault, Casper. Beside, how can we stop 'em if we can't even see 'em? All: Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! I'll stay here and stand guard, and try to head them off if they come back. I'll be your guardian ghost. Want me to stand guard with you, Casper? No, carmelita. You go trick or treating with the others. Bye-bye! I wonder where they--hey! Oh! Oh! Oh! Hey, cut it out! Untie me, Harry, and leave those kids alone. You're going to get them in trouble. Ah, tch tch tch! Worry, worry, worry. We're not troubling the kids. We're just putting some fright into the night. Ah, don't be such a spoilsport, Casper. Laugh it up! Kitchee kitchee coo. Stop it, winnifred. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Stop! Ha ha ha! Stop! Stop! Ohh! Ohh! See, kid? Stick around US and you'll have a good time in spite of yourself. Stop, Harry! Come back. I sure am glad Casper's back there standing guard for US. Me, too. Shh! Keep it down. Huh? [Grrr] [Ring] All: Trick or treat, ma'am! Ok, children, don't go away. She's gonna get the candy. Oh, boy, finally. There you are. [Grrr] [Grrr] Huh? Harry: Let me give you a hand, kiddo. Don't say I never gave you anything. Here. A bone? What nice children. [Arf arf arf] What are you doing? Stop! Stop! Help! He's gone mad! Oh, dear! He's wrecking my house! Here's your old bone. [Arf arf--] You're not supposed to trick after you've been given a treat. But, ma'am, we didn't. We'll clean up this mess, ma'am. You most certainly will! Ha ha ha! Hoo hoo hoo! Where are my friends? Heh, look. The teeny one got loose again. Ha ha ha! Gol-darned if he didn't. Ha ha ha! Your friends are cleaning up a mess. Ha ha ha! Yeah, that we got them into! Ha ha ha! Oh, no! How could you? Oh, no! What a mess! Gee, Halloween doesn't seem like fun anymore. Woman: That's right, Mr. Duncan. They're cleaning up the mess right now. When they finish, I'll send them directly home. Good evening. Please, ma'am, this wasn't the kids' fault. Actually if anyone's to blame, it's my fault. I've heard enough. Now, finish the cleaning up and get out! Out, all of you! And report directly to your Mr. Duncan. Thanks, Casper, but I'm afraid you're a little too late. What's done is done. Yeah, and we're done for. I'm sorry, gang. Really. All: Goodnight, Casper. Goodnight. Goodnight. [Sniffling] Hey, uh, what's going on down there? Looks like the kids are going home. Hey, ho duddly-Dee-- hold it, kiddo! Where you goin', huh? Hold up there. Yoo-hoo, kiddo? It's your old buddy-wuddy. Ha ha ha! Hey, what's the matter, son? Ain't I gettin' through to ya? You don't suppose the lad's gone dingy? Hey, yoo-hoo, kids! Wait up! Hey! Hey, what's the matter with my little pal Casper? Did he eat too much candy? Ha ha ha. What candy? Your little pal took the blame for everything you and your whacky friends did. He did? Thanks to you, our trick or treating fun is over. Ooh, no wonder he wouldn't talk to me. Hey, kiddo, how's about givin' old Harry scary a chance to square things up with you and my little pal, huh? Square things? What do you mean? First of all, I'm going to have a talk with your commander-in-chief. You mean Mr. Duncan? Whatever, and then I've got a humdinger of a dandy plan. What? Yeah? What is it? Tell US. Well, now, listen to this. We're gonna get some supplies and then we'll head up and... Hey, Harry scary quit while the night is still young. That's his tough luck. Look! The little ones are going to try it again. How lucky can we get? Ha ha ha! Hoo hoo hoo hoo! Gee, I hope Mr. Duncan phoned the lady like he said he would. Carmelita: Me, too. Now all I have to do is twist the nozzle and shoot. Uh, trick or treat, ma'am. If--if it's alright with you. Of course, it's alright, children. Screech: Hey, what are you waiting for? Turn it on. Winnifred: It is on, dummy. There must be a kink in the hose. Here. Let me have a look. This is for your own good, screech. Ahh! Aah! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! You think it's funny, huh? Blah! Blah! Boo! Aah! Aah! Land sakes, it's a ghost! Follow me! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Boo! Aah! Aah! [Coughing] We may have to eat our pancakes without syrup for a week, but it's worth it. Eeyuu! What's happenin'? I'm not hanging around to find out! Gee, it would've been better for those little orphan kids if I'd never joined them. Golly, for a while, I felt like I was a real little boy with brothers and sisters. [Doorbell ringing] Huh? Who could that be? [Ring] All: Trick or treat! Trick or treat! Those voices! I know those voices. Could it possibly be... All: Hi, Casper! It's US, alright! Trick or treat! Happy Halloween! Joveas, carmelita, j.R., luella, dirk-- but how, how? How doodly-doo? Harry scary? Ha ha ha! In the flesh, kiddo! Well, sort of. Ha ha ha! Harry! But screech, winnifred-- what, where? Don't worry, kid. They had toooze off. Ha ha! Unexpectedly, of course. What about Mr. Duncan? Oh, Mr. Duncan. Hi, Casper. Welcome to our happy family. Here, Casper. I bought you a new costume, too. Hey, hey, hey! I say, let's get back to the business at hand, folks.
