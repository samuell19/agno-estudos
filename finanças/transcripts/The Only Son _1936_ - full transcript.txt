Tragedy in life starts with the bondage of parent and child. Shinshu, Central Japan, 1923. SPRING COCOONS TO BE BOUGHT Mom, four of us will go to high school. Is that so? The teacher asked if I'd go too. What did you say? Nothing. It'll cost money. Don't go! I'll make you some cake. I'm glad you came. Don't bother. Please sit down Thank you for everything. Not at all. Ryosuke is a bright student. I rate him high. You do? Thank you. He said you'd send him to high school. I'm glad to hear it. A man needs a good education... to succeed nowadays. It'll be a pity... if he never got past grade school. I'm glad you decided so. Higher education is very important. I want to study in Tokyo, too. Staying here won't get me anywhere. I'm glad you decided so. Sorry to have bothered you. Ryosuke, Mr. Okubo is leaving. Don't bother. Goodbye, sir. Ryosuke! Why did you lie? Why? We can't afford your high school! When will Mr. Okubo leave? By tomorrow's train. Really? He's such a good teacher. I knew he'd move to Tokyo sooner or later. He's always longed to go. Hurray, Mr. Okubo! Go to high school. I've reconsidered. If you can't go when others do I'll regret it, too. Go to high school. Maybe even college. Study hard and be a great man. If you can make it your late father will be happy, too. I'll do anything for your education Don't worry about this house. Just study hard. Go to high school. I'll send you to high school. I can do that much anyway. Understand? I'm getting old. I want you to stay with me. But as Mr. Okubo said you need good education. Don't worry about me. Study hard. Understand? Understand? I'll become a great man. Shinshu, 1935 My son got a job in Tokyo. Really? How nice! Time flies, doesn't it? You think so? To me, it's been a long time. I think I'll go to Tokyo in spring. That'll be nice. He's already twenty-seven. It's time he got a bride. Tokyo, 1936. It's been a long time. Did the trip make you tired? Not really. One of the passengers was kind to me. At Takasaki he even bought me a lunch. Good! How's Shinshu? It snowed heavily. The Sumida River. Eitai Bridge. That's Kiyosu Bridge. Such a big bridge! I'm glad you came. My house is across this field. Let's walk. A shabby place. Mom, don't get shocked. Why? At what? Actually, I got married. Let's go, anyway Here we are Mother's here Come in Welcome. Please come in. How do you do? She's Sugiko. I'm glad you came. How do you do? Thank you for taking care of him. Dirty house, isn't it? Mom, come! He was born last year. I considered for a long time. I named him G-ichi after Dad. He's asleep. He's your grandson. Can we talk? What about supper? Any money? A little. What would you like to eat? Anything will do. Anything? Buy some chicken. Don't be too long. She's a restaurant owner's daughter. A restaurant owner's daughter? When I boarded as a student she lived nearby. I should have told you. I'm sorry! That's all right. She's your wife. I ordered some. Have enough money? Be nice to Mom. I know. Not the ward office? I resigned from the ward office half a year ago. You did? I'm going. I'll be right back. Sir. Why are angles BFD and BFA equal? This and this are equal. I know that. As for triangles PBD and PAE these two are right angles. The square PBCA is within a circle. So, this and this are equal. Thus, these two angles are equal. I understand. That's good! It's a famous theorum. Lend me ten yen. Ten yen? I can't spare so much. Five will do. Sorry to bother you. Thank you! Mr. Matsumura, will you lend me five yen? My mother came to town. Will you, please? I'll return it on payday. How about 10% interest? Sorry to trouble you. It's so sudden. Thank you! How much does the school pay you? Only a little. But we can manage. Sorry to keep you. Teachers can't get leave easily. Have one. Make some tea. Your pillow. If I'd known you have a family I'd have brought a gift for them. I'm well. That's nice. How's Mr. Okubo? He's fine as usual. Shall we go see him? Yes. I'd like to see him. Let's do so. He'll be surprised. Have another? It tastes different. Here we are. CUTLETS Hello! This is a surprise! Please come in. I'm overwhelmed. Come in. Give her a cushion. I'm glad you came. It's been a long time. When did you get in? Yesterday morning. Is that so? It's been ages. Sorry I haven't written to you. I often hear about your from Ryosuke. But, as you see... Anyhow, I'm glad you came. Ryosuke, will you give me a towel? Soap is sometimes too harsh! Thanks! It's been so long I guess the old town has changed. Yes! The riverbanks where you played with him... are all concrete now. Is that so? I remember the beautiful flowers there. A big new auditorium too. In Tokyo we can even hear mountain birds chirping. I heard it, too! I wish I could go home once in a while, maybe in spring. What's wrong? They bullied me. What a boy! My second son. Stop crying! Bow to the guests! I know this isn't the proper way to train him. But it's the easiest way, so... Children are like that. How old is he? Six. He's really just a child. Aren't you busy? Not really. I never thought I'd have to do this in Tokyo. Things go only as they're destined. My wife. Ryosuke's mother. Welcome! She gave us this. My fourth. He looks bright. You have a grandson now. It's nice, isn't it? Something to stop babies from crying at night. Is that the one? Put it upside down. This is the talkie. Isn't it too noisy here for her to sleep? The rent's cheap. Can't help it. What about after tomorrow? We spent most of our money. So we did. Welcome back! The public bath here is nice. Thank you. Was it crowded? No! I'm tired. You walked a lot. Shall I massage you? Well? Shall I do it? Don't bother. Make some tea. Your hands are big now. Feel good? Like it stronger? I saw many places today. I visited Asakusa Temple, Ueno Park and... What impressed her most was... the big temple lantern. Such a huge lantern! Have you tried Chinese noodles? They're good. Let me massage you. The temple was so big! Three, please! Put in some meat. Good evening! Studying? I heard your mother came. She came so abruptly I'm in a fix. Here you are. Excuse me. Eat it while it's hot. Have some, Mom. I will, thanks. Good? Where shall we go tomorrow? Let's see. You've already spent lots of money. No. Where shall we go? The soup's good, too. Good, right? That's an incinerator. Really? Lots of garbage every day. Mom, do you like Sugiko? Sure. She's a nice person. I worried if you'd like her. Mom! What did you think about me? Are you disappointed? Why? Because even I'm not satisfied... with what I am now. I wish I hadn't come to Tokyo. I'm sorry I disappoint you too. I shouldn't have caused you hardship. Why? Why is that? Is that what you think? Your life's only beginning. I think so, too. But maybe I've reached... the end of a small game. Don't weaken. It's bad! I wish I'd stayed with you. Skylarks are singing. What's wrong? I can't sleep. Why not? It's late. Get some sleep. Can't forget what I said? Go to sleep. You're disappointed, aren't you? But I did my best. Your hardship encouraged me. But a night school teacher was all I could become. I'm not happy with myself. But I don't know what better job I can get. Really? Aren't you too young to give up like this? I haven't given up! I'm trying! But trying in Tokyo... is useless. Don't jump at conclusions. I've never once given up! It wasn't easy for a woman to send her son... to college in Tokyo. I don't want you to get frustrated. Maybe you think I'm a coward. But Mr. Okubo was ambitious, too... when he came to Tokyo. And look how he ends up now? As a man who fries cutlets. Mom! This is Tokyo. He's different No, here we're all the same. That's Tokyo. But there are many who succeed in Tokyo. Only a few. Still, there are. You came to Tokyo to succeed, too. I know. But it's not easy. I don't like the way you think. I don't want you to give up. I worked hard... because I wanted you to succeed. It kept me going. It was something to live for. But the way you think isn't right. I didn't tell you, but... I no longer have a house. I sold my house and land... everything is gone. I haven't told you but I live in a factory dormitory. It doesn't matter if you're doing well. I don't care about the house or land. You're all I have now. But if... you feel that way. What will you become? Will you live in Tokyo, too? Grannie! Hello! Where are you from? Shinshu. I know all the prefectural capitals. Niigata in Niigata Pref. Gifu in Gifu Pref. About Yamanashi Pref. It produces silk. Tomi! Mom wants me to buy tofu again. Bye! Use this and take Mom somewhere. The weather is nice. Take her somewhere. She didn't come just to nurse her grandson. How did you get it? I sold my kimono. I never wear it. You go, too! Me? Don't mind your clothes. Ask a neighbor to look after our house. Let's go! Tomi! Tme to study! Lend me your mitt. No! Stingy! You never lend it to me. Come! Hey, come! Watch! I can go and come back like this. Lend me your mitt. No! Will you see to our houses? Why not? Sorry to trouble you. Tomi got kicked by a horse. Where? What happened to him? In back of Shige's house. Tomi! See a doctor! He wanted a mitt so badly. I should have bought him one. Mom, buy me a ball. I feel sorry! But staying here, he'll get better in a few days. Use this money. But... It's all right. We must help one another. I'll send Sugiko to help you. Thank you! Thank you very much, Mrs. Nonomiya. You're always kind. Don't mention it. I'm glad it's not serious. Take care! Goodbye! Mom, buy me a ball! I'm sorry for what happened. It ruined your visit. It's all right. Instead, I'm proud to have you as my son. This wouldn't have happened... wherever you would have taken me. When poor, you appreciate things like that well. I know, because I was poor, too. Maybe it's good that you couldn't get rich. I'm proud of you. It's the best souvenir I can take home. Uncle! How is he? He left the hospital today. Thanks for everything. I'm glad to hear it. Mom sent you her regards. Did she go home? Yes. I saw her off. Is that so? I wanted to thank her personally. She was so kind to us. I tried to stop her but she likes it better home. I wonder how far Mom has gone. Do you think she likes me? Don't worry about it. Did she go home satisfied? I don't think so. Actually, I didn't want her to come to Tokyo. I didn't want her to see us like this. You agree? I wouldn't be happy, either if my son was a mere night school teacher. Use this money to buy something for my grandson. I'll study again. I'll get a certificate. And I'll invite my mother again. He won't be a baby forever. I want him to play a big game. You're lucky to have such a good mother. How was it in Tokyo? Tokyo is such a big city. There were so many people everywhere. It was like a giant festival. And, how is your son? He's become a great man. Is that so? You had a rough time for his sake. He's found a good wife, too. I have no more worries. I think I can die without regrets. You're a lucky woman.
