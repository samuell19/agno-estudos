I need to tell the Finches so they'll recognize you. - My blue dress. It's the same one that I wore to the Garfield party. - Oh God. - It's Chanel. - It's a Chanel wannabe and she's gonna know. - Even if she did, it means nothing. - It means that you are not successful enough to be selling at this level. - First of all, she's not gonna know and second of all, I'm successful and I wear it so why wouldn't somebody else? Stop being so paranoid. We are fine. - We better be because if your little plan goes south, we're at Costco eating crow in bulk. - Okay, well I'm not worried. - You got two minutes to sell it. - Mister and Missus Finch? - Yes. - Hi, Genie Burns. What a pleasure to meet you. - [Mister Finch] Genie, it's a pleasure meeting you. - Let's take a look at this empty nester's dream, shall we? - Thank you. - Thank you. - Oh. - Isn't this lovely? - This is special. - So the architect who designed this unit had a vision. There's actually a term for it called procession. - What? Like a funeral? - Uh, no. More like a surprise. But you don't see it until you move through the floor plan. And then it just affects you so deeply that you-- - That you buy it? - No, frankly, I'm not interested in big surprises in real estate. - No, I was gonna say connect to it. - Ah. He wants you to feel like you're a part of the design. - Well if there's any lavender up there, I'm home. - Ready for the debut of a lifetime? - Yes. - [All] Surprise! ♪ And we all come together ♪ ♪ And we all come together in love ♪ - How could we not take this place? ♪ And we all come together in love ♪ - Genie, how did you convince my owners to allow this craziness? - I told them I might lead to a sale. - Oh, really? Isn't that a bit presumptuous for a party planner? - Excuse me, I'm so sorry to interrupt. We just wanted to come over and say thank you so much for this party. - You've made our grandparents really happy. - Oh that makes me so happy to hear. Thank you. - I mean it was a little weird with all the questions you were asking. - Right, like what does a condo search have to do with a surprise party? - [Woman] And the sofa goes right here. - Oh. - So Maggie gets the commission on a condo that I sold and calls me presumptuous. I mean how rude. Stupid AC is not working and it's so hot. - Take. Take the rest of the afternoon off and buy yourself a new car. - I'll look but I don't have enough saved after the down payment yet. - You make good money. Where is it? - In my apartment. My bedding alone is amazing. Right, I spend way more time in my bed than I do in my car. - And what a coincidence they both have empty passenger sides, which reminds me. Thank you for getting that cop friend of yours to break up that party last night. I finally got to sleep. How do you even know him? - Oh we went to college together. - Mhmm. - Hey, I'll call you later. - Andrea, what is this and why does it smell like a cheap hotel bathtub? - It's liver season, boss. - Liver? - It's time to cleanse our toxic burdens. - Okay. - You know, in all the years we've been friends, why have you never thrown me a surprise party? - You've never said you wanted one. - Yeah but when have I ever wanted something without you telling me that I needed it first? Oh Danny, you know you gotta make crock pot oatmeal. It's the best. Oh Danny, you gotta get these sheets. They cost more than your taxes. You're gonna love 'em. Oh Danny, you gotta get your teeth whitened. Your smile looks so much better. - I am really annoying, aren't I? - Yes, but on the other hand, I wake up every morning to the smell of crock pot oatmeal and amazing sheets. (Siren wailing) Oh shit. (Bright music) - What's your hurry, sir? - Well, see it's my birthday and my friend here was taking me out to dinner for my birthday. So, can't give a guy a ticket on his birthday, can you? - Sure I can. Sir, I'm gonna need to see your license, insurance. - Oh right. Okay yeah. That's weird. It's always here. - Do you not have anything? - Feel like I've been robbed or something. - Why don't you not have your license? - Miss, are you able to drive your friend's car? He needs to come down to the station with me. - Are you serious? - Officer, I can vouch for him. He's very responsible and there's obviously an explanation and we will definitely figure it out, but today really is his birthday and if you knew what I have planned to surprise him. Please. Please. - [Officer] Follow me please. - Wait. Am I arrested? - [Officer] Zip it. Let's go.

Thank you. - Hi. Can I get a medium Americano, almond milk. Thank you. Whoa. Underpaying now, don't you think? - They offer so I partake. - I think they mean current drink. Oh come on. I just saved you from a hanging blueberry tag. - Burberry. - Whatever. - Artificial sweetener only works in my coffee. - Hey. - Morning. - Morning. Genes, did your hair drink Andrea's tea or is this a cry for help? - It's called a messy bun, Steven. - So, all you need to do is mess up your life and then you've got an outfit. - Oh. Do you remember the first day you walked in here? I remember thinking you were so handsome and polished. That I'd finally met-- - Arrived at fairytale central. - And that we'd be forced to fight our feelings like all great loves do until we finally had to give in. - We'd get married in a glorious ceremony. Have kids that man the phone lines. - And then we would die one day apart. - The town would throw a surprise funeral. - And we would share one casket with fluffy pillows and a Chanel throw covering our feet. - And then Surprise Enterprise would go on forever surprising people worldwide. The end. What? - Do you ever look at me and wonder? I read that 66 % of gay men end up in heterosexual relationships. - 100 % miserable. - Get over yourself. I was only kidding. I don't chase gay men. - [Steven] You would chase anything that doesn't want you. - It's always so good. - Yeah. - So glad you're here. - [Girl] Oh my lemon. - [Genie] When life rolls you a lemon. - I don't get it. - It's from a saying.

Sorry, gotta run. - Hey. Guess what? - What? - I made a reservation. - For what? - For dinner. - For who? - For us. - What? Where? - Aisle seven. Come on. It's got great reviews. Free parking, too. Hop on the cart. I'll take you over there. You think it's funny. I'm serious. Yeah come on. - I'm getting on your cart. - You're getting on my cart. - I'm not getting on your cart. - I will follow you around this grocery store and annoy you until you get on this cart. Come on. You can do it. - Okay fine. Just to shut you up. - Come on. Let's go. Coming down the home stretch. - [Genie] Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. - Let me help you off there. Jeff Bachmann. - Genie Burns. - Oh, the dinner reservation that I promised you is served. - Why thank you. What do we have here? - Not sure. - What are you looking for? - An onion. - You don't like onions? - It's part of a phobia. - That is a weird phobia. - Bottoms up. So, that was terrible. What would you say to maybe a meal with menus? - You know, I need to get back to my cart. - Hop on. I'll give you a lift. - Well, I'd invite you up for a nightcap but-- - Eh, it's okay. Lunch noon Wednesday? - Oh my god. You do not quit, do you? - Sky Blue Cafe. Come on. - Okay fine. Fine. Yes. - Yes. - Lunch on Wednesday. - Sounds great. Can't wait. - Oh I'm sure you can't. - Really looking forward to it. - Trick or treat. Morning. - So, what's my famous stepdaughter conjuring up at parties these days? - I'm hardly famous. But I did nail Danny the other night. It was awesome. - Danny? How is he? - Good. - You know, I have never understood why the two of you are not a couple. He's adorable. - You still on that splinter? - Tinder? No, but I am going out to lunch with a boy that I met the other night. - You know, I bet that we know at least 10 couples who started out as friends. Oh they had trust. They loved being together and eventually it turned into something more. - Mom, please stop. I'm not attracted to Danny that way okay. You can't force it. It's either there or it's not. - Your mother fell in love with me the first time she saw me. Who can resist this mug, huh? - That is so not true. - I remember the first time you came to pick up mom you brought me daises. - Oh my gosh. I forgot about that. - I also remembered that it made me miss daddy. Did I say something wrong? - [Mother] No. - [Genie] You know I love you a lot, right? - Hey, kiddo, I understood it then. I understand it today. Right? - It's part of the reason why I wanted to see you guys this morning. For some reason dad's accident is hitting me harder this year. Hey Mom, do you remember that costume that dad gave me that morning? - I don't remember a costume, no, but aren't we past talking about this by now? - Aren't we ready to talk about this by now? - Fine. - Oh that's right I forgot. You never saw my costume because you went into your bedroom and you never came out. Why did she do that? Why does she treat dad's death like some event that she can't go to and I have to go all alone? - Hey, Gene. For some people, feeling pain isn't an option. You're stronger, honey. You always have been. - Trick or non fat pumpkin latte. - Oh my god. You look so adorable but what is with the elephant? - Oh no, not just an elephant. I am the elephant in the room. .� - What's in the bag? - Oh, just leftover donut. - Oh yeah. - Okay, hold up. I rent an elephant costume for 85 bucks and you get excited about a donut that cost 13 cents. - It's a really good donut. (Doorbell ringing) That's a trick or treater. Don't eat my crumbs. - Oh this'll be good. - [Casey] Trick or treat. - Everything. It was just so awesome. Aunt Dottie? - Genie. - Crazy Aunt Dottie. Here we go again. - Genie, there's been a terrible accident. Your father. I can't. I don't know how to tell you this. - Tell me what? - The plane, Genie. It went down. Do you understand what I'm saying? (Soft music) - [Casey] You said I could visit. - Oh yeah. No, of course you can. Where's your grandma? - She's not feeling well. - Then where are your folks? - My mom died. That's why we moved here. - Okay. Well, you know what you get at this house. You get all the candy. How 'bout that, huh? - Whoa. - [Danny] Yup, there you go. - Aren't you a little bit too old to be an elephant? - Yeah, I am, but see my Batman costume was at the cleaners so. - I have a Batman sleeping bag. - Oh. - And I have Batman pajamas. - Well I am Batman so what? - I was Batman's girlfriend. What? - I still am. - You want us to go trick or treating with you? - Yeah. - Put that away elephant man. - Okay, I'm not saying I'm Batman. I'm just saying no one's ever seen me and Batman in the same place at the same time. That's all. - Happy Halloween. Couldn't you have hired a normal person? I don't even know why I agreed to this. She's not even nice to me. Ugh look at her. It's like working with a skinny stale Cheeto. - The whipped cream coffees, the candy. You are trying to get Andrea fat. Is there prison time for diet slaughter? Got you. - So are we speed dating? - That's the greeting I get? - Hi there. Are we speed dating? - She's a friend of my sister's. - You don't have sisters. - How did you know that? - I didn't. - So, did you think about not coming today? - No. - Really? But you don't see this going anywhere, do you? - Correct. - And why is that? - Because you're a player. Wait, let me guess what you do. You own a nightclub. Yes? With bottle service. Waitresses walking around in skimpy clothing. Basketball players. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh. I was wrong. Jeff Bachmann, Cosmetic Surgeon. I'm gonna let you buy lunch. - Don't mind if I do. Can I get you some iced tea? - Hate iced tea. - Coffee? - Stains my teeth. - Diet Coke? - Gives me the worse hiccups. - You are not an easy person, are you? - [Genie] Nope. - But worth the trouble, right? - I wouldn't say that. I guess it just depends on your tolerance. - Oh I'm very tolerant. Well, I am lactose intolerant. You're not milk, are you? - You know what? I'm out of here. - Can you believe he just left her like that? - Here's my mantra. Don't let the argument happen to begin with. Just give each other the benefit of the doubt. - Here's my mantra. If you don't argue, you don't care. But don't you dare leave me in this restaurant. - Don't you dare drive me away. - I'm sure I will drive you away. It's kind of what I do best. - I'll make sure that you don't want to. That's what I do best. - Well thank you very much for lunch. I had fun. - My pleasure. How 'bout dinner Saturday night? - I don't think so, but I'm sure I'll see you around. - Really? That's it? You're gonna walk away from a winning table? - I will admit that the table is hot, but it's too big a gamble. I'd probably lose my shirt. - I see that as a good thing. - Wow. - Hey, is that the shirt we got together? - Yeah, Kay makes fun of me every time I wear it. She doesn't share our same session with bargains. - Oh. What is it now, three weeks? - Yeah. It's going good. She's easy, there's no drama, she's fun. Sex is great. - Sounds like another beginning to an incredible relationship. I'm gonna give it 'til the end of the month. - At least I have relationships. Is there anyone you don't turn down? - I'm just looking for someone that offers more. Split the usual? - Yeah. - Veggie egg white omelet cooked dry with two salsas and extra plates please. - All right. - And lemons. Lemons. - Oh yeah. - All right, it'll be right out. - Define more then. - Like in a relationship? Well I guess that I want the whole plate. I want the healthy. I want the warm comfort. And salsa. - Now we get to the good stuff. - Oh my god, Danny. Does everything have to be about sex with you? - Does nothing get to be about sex with you? - No, I just. I wanna feel close with somebody to have it. - Hey, I let you order food I don't even like. What's closer than that? - Oh my god. That's not what I'm talking about. Look, I share everything with you, so you can be there for me, but you don't share anything with me, so I can't be there for you. It's frustrating. - I'm shallow. What can I say? - So you don't want to be close to somebody? - Don't really think about it. - Don't you care about anyone? - Course I care. I care about you. - I know you care about me, but if you care about somebody, how do you show them that you're there for them? - They'd see it. - You're just gonna just you standing there that shows love? - Yeah, standing, sitting, staying. Not leaving no matter what. That's love. Pass the syrup. - No, get your own. Get your own. - Give it. - No. - Unbelievable. - [Genie] What? - See Me Sign still can't pay their bill. Now they're trying to pay us in trade. Like we'd ever advertise on a billboard. - What if it's a subliminal message? We make sure that people about to be surprised see a sign that says surprise. - Blow it just before they get there. - No, we start a buzz around town. People see the word surprise and either they ignore it or they start to wonder. - Let's go. - What? Where? Oh my god, there's nothing on the books. Why won't you tell me what's going on? - You had a good idea. - I did? Wow. What? Was it the billboard? - Yup, I particularly like it to start a buzz in other cities. - No. No. We agreed to keeping the business local. - That was five years ago. We're established now. You're holding us back. - Surprise. Happy belated birthday. - Subliminal tease idea. I like it. - What's going on? - Steven gave you the day off, so I can take you for the birthday present of the century. - [Steven] Of the century. - Come on. - Oh my god, oh my god. - Come on, come on, come on, come on. Go, go, go, Genie. Go, Genie. - [Genie] This is a really creative gift idea. - [Lori] I knew you'd love it. Genie, Genie. - Keep going. That's out. Take it back to the center. Well, well, well, Genie Burns. Surprise. How are you? - I'm good. I'm just biking around 'til I meet up with a friend later. - Nice. - So you coach kids. - Yeah. Yeah. It's so much fun. Hey, I'm almost finished here. Do you have a few minutes? You wanna take a detour? - No. - Come on. - No, no, no, no. - So, my mom told my brother every day do not play in the river and of course. - He played in the river. - It was so much worse. He played on the ice and he fell in. - Oh my god. - Oh no, it's fine. I saved him. - [Genie] What, did you jump in? - Oh heck no. I wasn't even there. No, no, no, no. He was so afraid that my mom was gonna find out, I brought her blow dryer down to the basement. Helped to dry his clothes. She never had a clue. - [Genie] Why was he so afraid of your mom? Was she that strict? - No, no, she was an alcoholic. She could get pretty volatile, you know. - So sorry. - Yeah, it's okay. - Is your mom still alive? - No. - And what about your dad? - He took off with a blonde when I was six. - Blondes are more trouble. - Yeah, yeah. We'll see. You know I've never talked about this stuff with anybody before? I feel like I can be myself around you. It's nice. - I gotta go. - Well, I'd ask you out but afraid of your answer. - Well, I am a surprise girl. - [Danny] Oh there she is. Genie. - Genie, Genie. Hi. I'm Kay. Finally we meet. I said to Danny the other day I love this Saturday tradition you guys have. I want in. Oh my god you are gorgeous. Is she real? Is this real lucky? - Yeah. - Hi. - And here we are. Oh man. Well, how 'bout we ride south? - Let's do it. - Let's do. He's such a goof. I said baby, I would not be caught dead wearing workout clothes to a farmer's market. What do you think I am, a cliche? You know I'm not that. - Yeah. - So we were gonna go grab lunch at our favorite little spot. How 'bout you join us? Oh Genie. - Well, I would love to. Thank you but I met this great guy and I'm gonna get some cute clothes for the date so. - Precious. Well then you should go. - I will. You guys have fun. - Why don't you get going?

Who is it? - He won't tell me so he must be really famous. - Oh my god. Steven, this is totally out of our league. - Not anymore it's not. Come on. - What? No, I can't do an interview like this. Oh thanks. Hi, I'm Genie Burns. I'm so sorry. I just came from this 10 year old's eat don't sleep slumber party. It was this big surprise. Surprise. What? (Vacuum humming) - Okay. Genie, to avoid leaks to the press, Bill would like the guests surprised, too. In Chicago because that's where the bride's family is from. - Okay. So just so I understand everything. You want us to plan a wedding on a day that you choose and then what should we call him? - Quentin. - So Quentin's girlfriend will know nothing about it. - That's right. - And you guys think that this will result in her marrying Quentin that day? - We don't think. We know. - Well have they discussed marriage? - Not your concern. If any part of this wedding should be less than perfect, that's your concern. - Okay well. So I can get an idea of her taste, is the bride traditional, eclectic? - He wants sleek. Over the top. - Bill, you want spectacular and unexpected. That's what we do. - Yes, but we need to have a better understanding about her so we can make the wedding feel like an extension of her. We need to know about her life, job, hobbies, favorite colors, funny quirks. - Your instructions are to make it a dream. You don't need to know anything else. - Okay so what kind of budget are we looking at? - High end. The bride's mother is having the dress made. It will be sent to you and she'll have a seamstress in the dressing room to make last minute alterations. When it comes, you need to try it on and check for any flaws. Just wash your hands please. - While I applaud your intent, weddings are very personal. No two brides are the same. So Bill, if you really wanna make this bride feel special-- - Then Genie is the perfect one to plan it. The quintessential romantic. If she loves it, so will your bride. - God, if I was his bride, I would dump the cake on his big, stupid head. - Hey now easy. The exposure to A listers is a game changer for us. What else did he say? Matching embroidered towels for me and my pug. - We are not wedding planners, Steven. I am calling Randy Schuster. - Who's that? - Our competition. - Not anymore. He is the best wedding consultant in town and we need him. Look, our job is to set up the story. - Okay, so my story is that we'd all be naked like newborn babies and then the aisle would be her birth canal and the bouquets would be all of our mothers' placentas. - And the frosting on the cake could be breast milk. - Oh my god you get it. - Okay ew. My story is to get married where my mother can't speak. Like under the sea in scuba gear. Wet suit tux. - Love it. My dream is to have an all white wedding with a really big cake. Okay we have to come up with something that will guarantee that she wants to be there. - And make sense in their lives. - That's it. Oh my god, you are a genius. - I am. What did I do? - Okay, he's a producer. So he says that he's making a movie and the last scene is this big wedding and he offers walk on roles to all his friends and family. - How do we get her to be the bride? - On the day of Quentin says that the lead actress' flight is delayed and he's very upset because he has a very tight schedule. So he's gonna shoot the wide shot first with extras as all the parts and he asks her to be the bride. - But how do we know she'll say yes? - If she loves him as much as he says she does, she's gonna want him to see her as a beautiful bride, so he gets the idea to propose. - True again. - She sees herself in the mirror when she's all made up and she's filled with a sadness because she wishes that this was really her wedding and then she approaches the aisle. Suddenly, someone touches her arm and whispers surprise and it's her father. - Stop. - In a fog speechless, she walks down the aisle as faces just turn towards her revealing all of her loved ones. And then she looks at the altar and there is Quentin, the man of her dreams, and slowly he walks towards her and then he drops to his knees and he asks her the question that just minutes before was an answered prayer and she says yes. - Oh. Whoa girl. - It promotes vaginal flora. - No self promotions in the office. Oh my god. - What kind of oil did you use in that dressing? - [Andrea] Coconut oil because it's good for everything. - Hey Tanya. - Hey. - I thought I'd bring something to sweeten up the boring meetings today. - What meetings? - The staff meetings. Isn't that why the office is closed? - We're not closed. It's just lunch so nobody's here. - I must have gotten my dates confused. Well, enjoy anyway. I'll see you later. - Bye. - Hey. - Hey. What's up? - I've been trying to call you all day. - I've been busy all day. - I stopped by earlier. - You did? - Yeah. I know you didn't have staff meetings today. - Are you accusing me of something? - No. What would you think? - I would give you the benefit of the doubt and I thought I had meetings but it turns out that they're next week. Just been too busy to answer the phone. That's all. - I'm sorry. I don't know why I just jump to like worse case scenario. You're right. Been totally crazy. - It's been yeah one of those days. - Thank you. All right. Get back to work. I'll see you later. - I'm at it. - All right. (Gentle music) I guess I just thought that you didn't care about me anymore so. - Why do you even go there? - I don't know. I just do. Danny, do you ever lie to Kay? - Do I ever lie to Kay? I mean without being specific, I'd say yeah I guess I have. - Do you ever lie to me? - Okay look, here's the deal. I gotta be honest with you. Last week when I brought over that pizza and I said it was gluten free, it wasn't gluten free. - If Kay questioned you like she didn't trust something that you had said, would you get mad at her? Would you wanna break up? - No. I'd probably just explain myself better. Reassure her, you know. - God. I feel like being in love sets you up not to trust because you're so afraid of getting hurt. - Maybe but if you're in love with the right person, you trust yourself enough to be in it. - Danny, that was so deep. - I gotta subscription to deep digest. I get two deeps a month. What? I do. - So do you think? Do you think that I trust you because we're not in love or because you're to be trusted? - Or maybe you are in love with me and trust me. You just don't trust yourself. That's it. That's all I got. I used up my two deeps. That's it. - Sorry. (Knocking on door) - Coming. Yes. - Happy anniversary. - Hey. Let me help you out with some of that. - Thank you. Ooh. - Game's almost over, babe. - [Commentator] Next pitch is hit deep. Way back to the wall. - Get him. Yes. - [Commentator] What a great catch right at the wall. Boy does he have his stuff tonight. - Relax, you'll get some attention. Just give me a minute. - Attention? How 'bout just a thank you? - Wow. You've only been here 30 seconds and you're already screaming at me. - I'm not screaming. - You know just because I don't react to things the way that you expect me to, it does not give you the right to get mad at me. - I'm not mad. I'm just hurt. - Well if you can't drop it right now, maybe you should go. - [Commentator] He knows he has control over this game. A lazy swing on a curve ball results in a ground ball to short. The throw is made and he's out. (Soft music) (knocking on door) (soft music) (knocking on door) Another home run. This is now a tied game. (Soft music) - [Dottie] Honey, it's time to get to bed. - When's mommy coming out? - I'm not sure. (Soft music) (knocking on door) - Have you been to this new place? The cookie joint? They have cookie fries. It's genius. - Well, it's been open over two years, Gene. - [Genie] Oh my god, is that your mom's mac and cheese? Oh, can I have some? - [Lori] Genes, what's going on? - Mac and cheese dip. That should go on Kraft. They pay for ideas like this. You know what? - You know, a girl at work had an eating disorder and she found an amazing therapist. I'll get her number. - That was a bottle, I think. - Genie, call her. She's unconventional but good. - Stop being ridiculous. I'm fine. I'm probably just getting my period. - Oh that's so gross. I can't even watch. Genie. - You know what? - Oh yeah. You wanna wash all that down. Keep on going. All right that's impressive. - Done. What? I'll help you clean up. - [Lori] Yeah right. - Sorry. - I'll go get the broom. - I will get that. I will get it. - [Lori] Don't you dare eat off the floor. - I would never eat off the floor. Eating disorder my butt. Eating disorder. (Bright music) - Good morning. - [Genie] Morning. - Sign in. Have a seat. We'll call your name soon. - Okay. - Genie Burns. Genie Burns. So tell me. Why you here? - Well I've been binging a lot. - You been purging? - No. I work out a lot and I diet until I lose the weight, but then of course I sabotage myself. - Is anything stressful going on? - Not really. I was kind of hoping that you could give me some sort of like professional diet to help me get my eating back on track. - Okay, Genie. Binging is not a food problem. It's a feelings problem. - What feelings? - All right. If there was a little girl and she was upset and you weren't paying any attention to her, what would she do? - Throw a tantrum. - And what would calm her? - Dunkaroos. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. She needs to be heard. She needs to be acknowledged. That's what will calm her, Genie. Inside of big Genie is a little, little Genie okay. And when that little Genie doesn't get heard, she gets upset and she starts sending cravings right to your belly. And what happens when that craving hits? What does big Genie think? - That she's hungry? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. So what does she do? - She eats. - Right, right, right, right, right. And then what happens? - Diet. - Right, right. What about all that great food she loves that she can't have anymore? What about that food? What happens there? - She craves it even more. - She craves it even more. Yeah then what happens? - She goes on a diet. - Can you see what's happening here? Can you see where I'm going? In all this calorie chaos, what happened to that little girl? The little girl. What happened to her and her feelings? - Nobody hears them. - No one heard them. No one heard them. No one heard them. - I'm sorry. I don't understand what we're talking about. - Okay. You're what did you call it? You said you're professional diet you're on, it's about feeling your feelings okay. I don't care what they are. I don't care how shameful, how insecure, how immature, how stupid some of these feelings may be, they're yours and you need to have them. - Well, I don't have that many feelings. - Ooh. Ooh your binging says you do have a lot of them. It does. That's what it says to me. I can hear loud and clear. - Well if she's the reason I'm eating so much, then she's a little brat and I hate her. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. She's not a brat. We love that little girl. We need to nurture her. Just not with food okay. What's gonna happen the next time she sends you a craving? - Put that little bitch on a timeout. - For you I think twice a week. - I have called me some Catherine and I have booked the venue and I got vegan food for scaredy cats. Got it. Let me guess. We're about to have a conversation about you. - Jeff and I are supposed to go out to dinner tonight with Danny and Kay. The thought of her just makes my skin crawl. - Oh. Well you never like Lori's boyfriends, but you're fine going out with them. What's so special about Kay? Ah get it. Special Kay. Special like cereal. Special Kay. Okay. RH - I'm gonna cry. - Is this everything for now? - Yeah. Oh you know what? She's gonna need some lemon wedges. - Oh yeah, please. - So Jeff, do you do implants? - Yes, I do. - You know what? Because her sister, she is flat as a board. I mean she is so flat you could skip her across the pond. - That's not true. Okay it's a little bit true. - Funny. Genie never mentioned what you do. - Really? Oh, he's an attorney. - A very successful one. - Folks, sit as long as you like, but we drop checks early for the theater crowd, and just in case I split it by couple. - Isn't that funny, Jeff? He thinks we're a couple. - Imagine that. - Welcome to the sound of hope. Huh, huh? How great is this? This is for binging and for weight loss, too. I'm gonna get a patent out on these suckers soon and I'm gonna retire and maybe buy myself an island or get a little castle off the coast or something. I haven't decided what I wanna do with all the money yet. Anyway, okay so here's what we got here. Okay, think of every craving as a beep right. It's like your own personal alarm system to know that you are processing something. You're acknowledging something. Am I right? - Like what? - Oh we don't know. We don't know. We have to analyze all of our feelings around food. Whenever you're thinking about food, trying not to eat something, thinking about whether you should eat something, we have to stop. We have to make a choice right then okay. Do we feed it or do we feel it? Am I right? Okay let's say you're halfway into a bag of chips. You're like oh my god how did this happen? I'm having a bag of chips. Not again, not again. We gotta stop and we gotta think uh oh. What happened? Let's go backwards. Let's go backwards. What happened? Did someone say something earlier that made me feel bad? Am I dreading something coming up in the future? Am I uncomfortable in this situation? Why do I eat more around this friend than that friend? Do I even like that friend? Oh am I bored? I'm having the best time of my life and it's so fun. All of these are feelings that we're processing. Do you get it? - So what do I do if I'm like actually hungry? - Well like any responsible adult, you feed your cravings. Look, we try to make it something healthy, but if you want a treat, then you have the treat. You know? Deprivation only leads to binging. - I don't know. I mean like what if I just love food too much? - Do you? You like food way too much? Oh, what do I have here? Would you like one of these? - Not really. - See, I knew it. I knew you could say no to food. It's just important for us to think about when we're not eating as we do when we're thinking about when we are eating. - I don't understand. - Every moment that you're not eating is because it's a moment you're fully engaged in. You don't need anything else to be added to it. You're comfortable where you are and even if you're not that comfortable, you're handling it. You're dealing with life upfront. - So how do I stop a binge? - Oh well that. You have to treat that like a burglary. When a guy breaks into your house, you just hope that give him what he wants and he leaves peacefully. But you know what? You know what you don't need to do? You don't need to go to the bottom of every single bag when you're on one of those binges okay. You could just skim over the top of your cravings right. That is called self control. Oh hey all right here's something. Here's something. Little tidbit for you. This what's called a zero calorie binge. Ready for this? Okay here it goes. Oh I'm so mad. Oh I'm gonna punch you in the nose. Punch you repeatedly in the nose. That is the funniest thing I've ever heard. Why? Why me? It's not fair. It's not fair. Oh man I'm talking too much. Oh I'm talking too much. Oh I'm imitating the two people I hate. Blah, blah, blah, blah. All of that zero calories. Nothing went in, nothing went in. Nothing went in. All day, all night catch the feeling before you bite. That's right. You're welcome. You can have that. I'll add it to your bill. - Steven, what's that in your mouth? Where'd you get that from? - From the bag on my desk. You want one? - I'm listening for a beep. - Well this one's dead. You wanna try another one? - Not the Twizzlers, Steven. Us. - We beep? - Potentially. If I want one, it could mean that I don't like being around you. Or it could mean that I like Twizzlers and then I can have one as a treat. But hold please. I like Twizzlers but I don't want one right now. - Yes. - Steven, you and I, we don't beep. Yay, yay, yay. I'm so happy for us. - Me too. What are you talking about? - I started seeing a therapist about my binging and she says that I have to feel my feelings instead of eating them. - Wow. She'll ought to win the Nobel pizza prize for that one. What? - She wants me to process things. Get them out. Share. - Oh no. They'll clog the vents, blow out the internet connection. Genie, let's be sensible about this. Keep them buried deep inside 'til you explode like a giant, dying star okay. Thank you. - Just give me a Twizzler. - I prefer pink as like stuff around you, but I prefer turquoise to something to wear. - I really like it. - Turquoise is just the best thing on earth. Once I went swimming. Well actually I was boogie boarding. I was like swallowed up by a pull in the water. - What is the matter? Starbucks wants their sweet and low back? - Jeff keeps canceling plans and seems almost like he's avoiding me, but then he acts like he still loves me. So how am I supposed to-- - [Mom] Good morning. - [Genie] Mom, what are you doing here? - Can't a mother surprise her daughter? - [Genie] Something going on here? - [Mom] Well, I found these in the attic. Your father was quite the photographer. - You don't want this anymore? - Well I thought they would mean more to you. - Ooh look, a camera. How 'bout that? It's old. Selfie time. - Stop it. - I was gonna give you this when you got married, but I thought you know since I'm giving you the rest. Your father gave me this the night before our wedding. (Soft music) - But I'm not getting married. You part with this stuff like you don't even care. I mean how come I never even see you care? - Genie, of course I care. (Phone ringing) (soft music) - What's the matter? - Wedding's off. - What? Are you kidding? Why? - [Steven] He didn't say. - I knew that this was a bad idea, Steven. You had better charge his ass anyway because I put so much work into this. What? - Nothing. I'm just surprised. - Why? It's not like we've never been canceled on before. Probably broke up. - Hey. - Hey. I am so sorry. I did not realize you were working from here. Don't mind me. I'll just drop these off and skedaddle. (Soft music) - Hey goof. What you doing here? - I brought up your clothes. - Hey, hey, hey. Sue's just a doctor from LA okay. She's moving to her New York office. She was staying in a hotel in town. We just we had some work to finish up before she had to pack. That's all. - Her suitcase is in your bedroom. - Yeah, she went for a run. She needed to take a shower. - You were too busy to see me all week. You barely return my phone calls, my text messages. And then I come here and I see this and you tell me that nothing's going on. - Okay because I want this relationship to work, I'm gonna put my feelings aside and I'm gonna try to understand what you felt coming in here okay. I've gotta get Sue to the airport. I'll call you later okay. - Well then I'll come with you. - No, no, that's ridiculous. - Please, Jeff, please. Okay there's just something. There's something wrong here. Will you tell her that something came up with work and you'll call her a taxi and you'll pay for it? - Genie, you're going to kill this relationship with your issues okay. I mean, if I don't text you right away, I've vanished. If I don't compliment you enough, you're hurt. Now you think I'm cheating on you. I love you so much but who wants to live this way? Who? I gotta go. - Please Jeff. Please don't leave me like this. Jeff, please don't leave me like this. (Phone beeping) (bright music) Oh my god. My dad used to take me here. I thought this place closed. - [Jeff] It was. They redid the whole thing. ♪ I'm looking for someone ♪ ♪ For someone ♪ ♪ But now I am just staying here ♪ ♪ I've been looking for someone ♪ ♪ In places where lovers live ♪ - Jeff, I don't think I can do this. I think I'm gonna be sick. - Come on. Don't be a baby. It's gonna be fun. ♪ I believe, I believe ♪ ♪ But my heart ♪ - Oh yeah. I promise it's gonna be fine. - I'm sorry to bother you but. - Where are you? - Santa's Village. Jeff took me on the drop. I don't know what's happening but I can't face him. - Well you probably had your equilibrium thrown off, which can effect your emotions. Maybe it's a small panic attack. It's not a big deal. We can get through this. - Jeff's a scary ride. - [Woman] Hey, there's a line out here. - I'm talking to my therapist. Can you not? - Can I not what hold it in? No, I cannot. - Jeff's not a ride. Jeff's a man. We just have to figure out if he's the right man for you. Right now I want you to go put some cold water on your face. Splash it on your face. Okay sweetie? And breathe. - Man troubles? - Yeah. - Dump his ass. - But what if it's me? What if he's every woman's dream? - Girl, you on a public bathroom floor crying like a baby. That ain't no woman's dream. - Can you give that to the? I need the lady to. (Soft music) - Well thank you for trying to make things better for us. You wanna come up? - No, I'm kind of tired. I'll talk to you tomorrow. - Okay. Bye. (Soft music) (phone ringing) Hey. - Ruh roh. - It's okay. As long as I identify the emotion, Ellen says I shouldn't fight the binge. I can negotiate. - Like you get the Pringles and it gets the kids? - Sort of. - Listen, I'm headed over to throw me a freaking bowl. I have to make a gag gift for a bachelorette party. Wanna come? - And so Ellen said that one of my many problems is that I don't have object permanence. - Didn't you get that lasered? - It's when you cover a baby's toy with a blanket and he cries because he thinks that it's gone forever, but as he gets older he understands that even though he can't see it, that it's still there. This is why I flip out whenever Jeff is busy or he gets mad and he doesn't talk to me. You know, I think he's gone forever. - What? It's a gag gift. Get it? Gag gift. Okay, object permanence 101. What's hiding under the blankie? (Laughs) Top of the morning to ya. - We have to eat light because I'm meeting Lori for cake later. - Actually there's something I wanna talk to you about. Kay wants to get engaged. - What? Are you in love with her? - Are you in love with Jeff? - Stop not answering me. - Stop not answering me. - Can you two bring it down a notch? - The relationship is tough but I'm working on my stuff. I'm difficult. - Well maybe you need someone stronger. - Jeff is strong. At least he tells me how he feels. - Yeah and then he shuts you out as soon as you tell him how you feel. - Well nobody knows how you feel. - [Waitress] Do you mind opening the blinds? Can I take your order, folks? - [Genie] Oh yeah. We are going to split the spinach-- - Actually I'm gonna take the French dip. - That is it. You are just like every other man. - Why, because Kay wants to marry me? If you don't want me to marry Kay, just say it. Just say it. Say I don't want you to marry Kay. - [Customer] I want you to marry Kay. - What? I didn't put that up there. (Phone beeping) Casey fell and hit her head. Missus Harris doesn't know what to do. She doesn't know if she should take her to the hospital. - Come on, let's go. I'll drive you. - Hey. - Her doctor says she looks fine. We just have to watch her and check in on her tomorrow. - Hey Case, I heard you hit your head. You know rumor has it that Bruce Wayne fell and hit his head and when he woke up, all of a sudden he was Batman. - That sounds a lot more like Two Face. - Which one's he? - Oh so Two Face has a good side and an evil side. He uses the good side to cover up all the evil things he's done. (Soft music) - Have you decided what you'd like to order? - Yes. Out of control chocolate cake for her. Carrot cake for me. - Thank you. - You still worried about Casey? - No, she's gonna be okay. Jeff and I got in this stupid fight. I was mad at him because he didn't go visit Casey. - Why didn't he? - He said he had some emergency. So I got upset with him and then he got upset with me for being upset with him and then I got upset with him for being upset with me for being upset with him. So then he canceled our plans for the weekend. I just have to stop getting mad at him about things that he can't control. - Okay. What about that suitcase? - I trust him. - Here you go. - Oh thank you. - This one's my favorite, too. - Okay, Genes. You've turned into one of those stupid, pathetic, stringy haired woman that we can't stand. What happened to my confident friend? You know, even if he's telling the truth, I've never seen you this unhappy. I know that you love this guy, but is this how you wanna live? It's like this is it, Genes. This is who you are with Jeff. (Soft music) - I don't think I can eat this. Switch. Switch, switch, switch, switch, switch. - Why are we doing this? - I've just demoted Jeff. He's now carrot cake. - You love chocolate cake. You'll try to stay away but you'll cave. Switch back. Come on. - No, I don't want this. I don't want this. I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it. - Okay all right. Okay. Are you really gonna end it? (Bright music) Wow. Genes. I'm looking into your future right now. And you know what I see? One day when you least expect it, you'll fall in love with a nice apple cobbler (laughs). (Soft music) Yeah, it's not bad. - I can get used to this. - We're not switching back. (Gentle music) - That is tart. - That's the ginger. - Don't you ever let yourself go? Like does deep dish pizza ever in your mind? - Not really. - What do you do if you're feeling hurt? - I cry. - How do you do that? Like make yourself cry. - You know that racy feeling you get when you're obsessing about something? Like you're a crazy person and it won't go away. Life is bad, bad, bad and it's never gonna get any better. - Yeah, you basically just wrote my Match profile. - I dive in. - [Genie] To what? - The wrongness of it. Just dwell on how awful it is. - Why would you wanna do that? - Emotional detox. It cleans me out. I feel better afterwards. I guess, you know, after all the swelling goes down, I think that maybe I even look a little prettier. I think that sobbing is the fountain of youth. Or something like that. - But you don't ever cry about stuff here at the office though right? - Every time you put one of those cups of poison at my desk. - I am such a jerk. I'm so sorry, Andrea. I guess I was just jealous because of how skinny you are. I'm so sorry. - Thank you. Thank you. ♪ I understand ♪ ♪ Whatever I feel ♪ ♪ Is wherever I am ♪ ♪ Watching my life and how its grown ♪ ♪ Looking on back to things I've known ♪ ♪ It's not so bad all alone coming home to myself ♪ ♪ Again ♪ ♪ I'm coming ♪ ♪ Home ♪ - I know it's only been a week, but I miss him so much. I walk around with this hole in my gut. And it never leaves. - Are you binging? (Dramatic music) Oh, oh. Huh? - What just happened? - You faced a truth. You made decisions. You took control with dignity and strength. I mean yes, you're in a lot of pain, but you're managing it. Well done. - Well I was better off eating. At least then I knew my life sucked. - Yeah, everyone's life sucks a little. - Does this mean I'm cured? - Cured, no, no. But very well equipped. - My mom's been calling more lately. Like she wants to get together. - What do you make of that? - I don't know. She feels bad for me. But I needed her to feel bad about my dad. To share that with me. - I know. She's limited. I have a question for you. I'm gonna challenge you on this one. Does fixating on the ways she can't be there, prevent you from seeing the ways she wants to be? No matter what is going on. No matter how hard things get. There's a way to turn it around. I mean it could be small but it can change the course. You wanna know what it is? A choice. All possibilities start from there. What made you wanna start your business? - The idea that someone could be going on with their day. It could even be a bad day. But they have no idea that something amazing is about to happen. I love being a part of that. - [Andrea] All you can get. Like you know what I mean? - [Steven] You're both needed in the conference room. - [Genie] What? Is it back on? - Yup. Andrea, I need you to go to the Garrity. They're gonna want a check in advance this time. And since you're the flower expert of the family. Tom has a bouquet he wants to show you. - Steven, did I tell you? Every flower has its own sentiment. - Yeah? When this is all over, I'll be sure to send Quentin a long stemmed chrysanthe-butt. Go on, get out of here. You wanna talk about your feelings? - Yeah, I can't believe-- - Put on this dress, girl. And wash your hands. (Bright music) And don't let it hit the floor. - [Genie] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Oh my god. (Bright music) Wow. Since you stopped pigging out, your waist and ass are smaller. - Really? - But so is. - Can't you ever be kind? - I tried it once. Made me beep. - Wouldn't it be the best surprise party ever? Gay man fakes gayness to surprise the bride to be. - No. The billboard's up. She can't miss it. - Great. ♪ Surprise me with something I never asked for ♪ ♪ We both know I just say no ♪ - [Genie] So if you could just move that one over there, I think it would be perfect. - Guess who got dumped? - I knew that this would happen. - We still got paid so it's fine. We just gotta get his guests to go home. - That is so humiliating. - I thought you'd be happy. - I am but he's still our client. We can't just close up and go home. That would be heartless. - You wanna fix him up with the chef? - Idea. Idea, idea, idea, idea, idea. Okay, okay. If the guests thinks we're shooting a wedding, let's do it. They won't know it's fake and he still saves face. - One small detail. Bride and groom. - I fit into the wedding dress and you have a tux. - Fine. I'll get an extra to play father of the bride, so he can walk you down. See you at the altar. - Wait. Don't you think we should tell Bill and Randy? - Man, you are good. - I know. - Okay. (Gentle music) - Look at that beautiful bride. (Gentle music) - Can you give me a minute? Sorry. I'm very emotional lately. I've been like a car with no brakes. - You familiar with Taoism? It's a philosophy. Since water always finds the easiest way around blockages, that's how we need to move through our lives. Go the way of the water. - I don't understand. - Act like water. Let life happen. Just follow the flow. (Gentle music) Was this for today? - That was from my mother. For my wedding day. - [Woman] I'll help you. - Well, here comes the bride. (Gentle music) - Surprise. (Gentle music) - I clean up in a tux but I am not well groomed. If you know what I mean. You still love him? How do you feel about Quentin? (Gentle music) - I figured it was time someone gave you a happy surprise. - How did you? How did everyone? I don't know what to say. - I think you just say I do. The night I gave you that necklace I knew I wanted to marry you, but I just felt like proposing was so ordinary. So the next morning I called Steven and I had my buddy Bill come to your office. - But the wedding was canceled and that was before we broke up. - We had a lot of difficulties between us and I admit I got distracted, but then I realized why I made that commitment. I love you. We can't just walk away from this. Genie Burns. My one and only true love. Will you marry me? (Soft music) - Half chocolate cake, half carrot cake. My wedding gift to you. - Jeff, what's changed? - Everything has changed. My perspective. My whole outlook has changed. We can have it all if you just trust me and stop letting your insecurities get in the way. - My insecurities? Just because I have thought or a feeling or I voice my opinion, that doesn't make me insecure. In fact, the only thing that made me insecure was you. - I'm always trying my best. Okay I just need you to give me the benefit of the doubt. - The benefit of the doubt. Like that day that I stopped by your apartment and Sue was there? You guys weren't working? She was staying there, wasn't she? - We have to face forward. It's the key to any relationship, Genie. Just look around you. I did all of this for you. Hey. This is how much I love you. - I love you, too, but I love me more. I'm sorry. O (gentle music) - Somebody order banana pancakes? - You keep a really good secret. - Genes, I had to. There's so much I wanted to tell you. - Really? Like what? - When Steven sent out Jeff's invitation, I had an unexpected reaction. I was gonna tell you. I even rented one of your signs and I was gonna have you see it when we had lunch that day, but then Casey got hurt and I realized that if you wanted to marry Jeff, then I had to let that happen. It just felt wrong to be with Kay while I waited to find out. - What do you mean? Did you guys-- - Oh yeah we broke up like a month ago. I just kind of been avoiding you until this. - You waited for me. - I waited for me. (Gentle music) - You realize that you just told me that you love me. - I did? - Standing, sitting, staying. Not leaving no matter what. That's what you said. That's how you show love. You did. - I guess I did. So, that wedding's all paid for huh? - Yup.
