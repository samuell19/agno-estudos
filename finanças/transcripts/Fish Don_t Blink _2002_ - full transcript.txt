[piano playing] Jimmy. Need help. Bad news. Bad news? Jimmy, hurry. Officer Kelly wants... blueberry pancakes and coffee. And make it snappy, dummy, I’m in a hurry. He said "dummy"? He wants pancakes. I’ll make them. No, no, Clara. Clara, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do the cooking and you set the tables, remember? Here, go ahead. Go on. Besides, nobody is gonna cook anything until he comes in here, sits down, and orders off the menu. Asshole. Asshole. Would you look at the mess Pop left? Do you miss him, Clara? Oh. I’m sorry. Leonard, I need help. Mom and Pop, Clara, they’re gone. Leonard wants to know if you still, miss them. Oh, yes! Oh, yes! No, no. Clara, Clara. Clara, no, they’re not in the trailer. They’re dead. -Remember? -Oh, right. Dead. Too bad. Sorry. Dead as Fred. Dead as a door nail. Uh-oh, Jimmy. Police! Clara, it’s okay, you don’t have to hide. Clara, how’s Charlie doin'? [Clara] Oh, he’s fine. He’s just fine. [whispering] What’s he saying? [in husky voice] Happy birthday, Leonard. [Leonard chortling] That is the smartest fuckin’ catfish I’ve ever seen. Hey, hey, Leonard. Do you mind the language? It’s my sister. Sorry, sorry. You don’t mind do you, Clara? She doesn’t mind. You know, that son-of-a-bitch of a catfish is still growing. [Jimmy] I know. I have to build him a new tank every year. Door needs fixin’. Thanks. I’ll get right on it. Jimmy’s waitin' for Pop to fix it. Pop’s gone, remember, Clara? Oh, right. Morning, Leonard. Pancakes ready? In a minute. Wrap ’em to go. Hey, Charlie. Hey! Hey, blink! [Kelly laughs] Hey, leave her alone, Jeff. Stop it! I caught Charlie. He’s mine. Let’s see your fishin’ license. License? [Kelly] You gotta have a license to catch a fish. You don’t have a license, that catfish is illegal. Jimmy? [Clara breathing heavily] Jimmy, help. Please. [laughing] Yeah, ’cause see, uh, what we do with, uh, illegal catfish is send them to the penitentiary to be electrocuted... [laughing] ...like all the other criminals. [wheezing] Clara, Clara, Clara, look at me. Look at me. Look at me. -Charlie’s... -Shh. It’s okay. No, Charlie’s fine. Charlie’s fine, sweetheart. Look... Look at me. Shh-shh. I know. It’s okay. It's okay. It’s okay. Charlie’s gonna be fine. Charlie’s fine. Okay, look at me now. [shushing] I know. I know. Charlie’s gonna be fine. Charlie’s okay. Okay, look at me. Now slow down. Take a deep breath. Here we go. Ready? With me. With me. [both breathing deeply] Okay. Okay, you’re fine. -[whimpering] -You’re okay now. Here, let’s lift your arms up, okay? Come on. Come on. All right. Take a deep breath. Okay. Here, let’s sit you up. There you go. Okay. [Kelly laughing] Hey, hey, I was only kiddin’ around. It’s not my fault, uh, she’s a retard. You get the hell out of here. And I swear to God, if you so much as look at her funny, I will make you sorry you were ever born. You ease the fuck up, Jimbo. She’s not retarded. That’s right. I’m goofy. And you’re not goofy either, Clara. You don’t fool me. Not for a second. What’re you going to do, Jeff? You gonna pull your gun on me? Are you gonna shoot me? Yeah, why don’t you shoot me, like you shot that kid in LA? [chuckles] You all are way too sensitive. [birds cawing] [Frances sighing] Hey, I need some water. It’s fuckin' hot out here. [chuckling] It’s fuckin' hot out here. What? It’s not me. It's not me. It’s probably a customer she hears coming. Who do you hear, Clara? It’s fucking hot out here! You still planning on selling? I’m thinkin' about it. I talked to, uh, Harry James this morning. He’s gonna list it for me. That ying-yang from TV? I gotta do something. [sighing] That man is obnoxious. Right, Clara? Right. Obnoxious. Clara should be in a home where people can look after her and she can be taken care of. Sunny Hill. That’s right, Sunny Hill. We went there last week, checked it out. Clara likes it just fine. I like it just fine. You don’t want to stay here? Leonard, keep out of this. It’s none of your business. Clara knows that the only reason I’m putting her there is ’cause I love her. Jimmy loves me. She’s got nurses there 24 hours a day who will make sure that she takes her medication. Dr. Roswell is there. She can watch TV all day long. She can play the piano. Clara, tell Leonard about the piano. Yes, it’s a beautiful piano. -It’s a grand piano. -Yes. Grand. I figure between Pop’s life insurance and what I’ll get for selling this place, Clara will be set up for life. [door rattling] Your door is broken. Uh... Yeah, I... I know. I’m, uh, I'm planning on fixing it. You got water? [Jimmy] Yeah, it’s... It's there on the table. [chuckles] You guys psychic or somethin’? No. My sister heard you. Hi, I’m Clara. I’m going to Sunny Hill. I bet you are. Be nice, all right? You got Frosted Flakes? Yes. Frosted Flakes. Yes. You are a very big woman. Thank you. You’re welcome. Why don’t you get me a big old bowl of Frosted Flakes, some milk, and a bunch of sugar, hmm? You want somethin’? Just some more water will be fine. Thanks. You’re welcome. [clearing throat] You folks havin’ trouble? Car broke down. Yeah, is there a mechanic hereabouts? Uh, Roy Lee down at the Darby Gas. No, Roy Lee is no mechanic. Yeah, well, we don’t have a mechanic, but, uh, Roy Lee does the work. Look, uh, I’m, uh... I’m a little short on dough, so I was thinking about fixing it myself. Is-Is there any tools around here I can borrow, like, I don’t know, some screwdrivers and things? Things? Yeah, things, God damn it. You don’t know the first thing about fixin’ cars. You wanna get back on the road or what? Yeah, I do. Knock yourself out, baby. I’ve got some tools in the shed out back. They’re old, but they work. Oh, that’ll be great. I’ll give you a ride out to your car. No, no, no, finish... finish your breakfast. No, I’m finished. Come on. Uh, we can pull it in. You know, that’s-that's my truck right out front. All right. Well, sounds great. Are you gonna be okay? Just fine. Pete. You wait. I’ll get that car started in no time. You’ll see. He’s kinda useless, but he means well. What the hell are you lookin’ at? You put a lot of sugar on there. Yeah? Well, I’m a dancer. Sugar gives me energy. A dancer? [gasping] I love ballet! [Jimmy] Clara? Clara, why don’t you go and feed Charlie now? -Okay? -Okay. So, um, where are you and your boyfriend headed? Who, Pete? He’s not my boyfriend. I’m just headed on a little vacation to Mexico. So he decided to tag along. You’re, um... Well, you’re dressed... Well, rather oddly for, uh, a road trip. Yeah? Yeah. Well, my show closed down... [clears throat] ...and I figured, you know, it’s kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing. You know how it is. So what’s in Mexico? [smacking lips] Tacos, tequila, wide open beaches that go on for miles and miles where you never see another soul. You can lay around in the hot, hot sun, and fuck for hours. Okay. [chuckles] [stammers] What the hell you put in that fish tank? [in deep voice] This is what I eat. Cat food? She’s talkin' for the fish. Oh. Talkin’ fish. That’s right. Charlie has a very soft voice. That’s why you can’t hear him, Frances, but I can. Clara is the only person who can hear Charlie when he talks. She has very special hearing. That’s how she knew your name was Frances. That’s right. Frances, it’s fucking hot out here. [birds cawing] Let me ask you something, brainiac. What’re you gonna do when you catch this broad? Hey, she’s not a broad. Show some respect. That’s the woman I love. Excuse me, but what’re you gonna do when you catch the woman you love? I’m gonna whack her. Whack her? [chuckles] The only thing you ever whacked was your dick. Hey, I whacked that one guy. Forget about it. He died of a heart attack. He was 100 years old. Maybe older. Yeah, well, he’s still dead, right? Heart attack. [sighing] [clears throat] [trumpet playing on TV] Hey, Clara, look, it’s Harry James. So, come on down, come on down. Come on down... -[Harry chattering] -Remember, I told you about him. Oh, yes, that’s right. Harry James. Mr. Harry James. You know, he’s coming by here later today and you get to meet him in person. Excellent. I can sell you a house and a car! Isn’t he somethin'? Uh, yeah, a real pisser. Do you hear them coming back, Clara? No. Not yet. [moaning] Uh, what are you doing? [Frances chuckling] Frances is taking a bath. Okay, uh, you... You can’t take a bath in here. [Frances] Why not? Okay, it’s... It's against our, uh, health code, for one. And-and you’re gonna offend my customers. [chuckling] What customers? Frances needs a towel. What I need is a shower. [laughs] [sighing] [Clara] Here’s your towel. Thank you. You’re welcome. Do you want to take a shower? Why, sure, let’s go. [laughs] Don’t even start with me. Do you want to take a shower or not? Hell, yeah. I could use a shower. Clara, will you take Frances out to the trailer and show her where everything is, and, uh, maybe find her something else to wear? Wash her, uh... thing? Okay. I’ll wash her thing. [clicking tongue] Oh... Damn, Charlie. She’s somethin', huh? [playing mouth organ] Shut up! Shut up! Stop playing that fucking thing. There. See what you made me do? Jeez. Listen, you little fuck, you ever touch me again, I’ll bury you right here in the desert. I don’t give a rat's ass who your old man is. Capiche? Yeah. Good. [sighing] [birds chirping] Here. There, there, and there. [both laughing] Here you go, Sugar. Clara. My name is Clara. Yeah, I know. Hey, Clara. [clears throat] What’s with all those travel posters? Oh. That’s all the places that Jimmy wants to go when I’m gone. Yeah? What about that one over there? Oh, that’s, um, Mom and Pop and me and Jimmy when we went to the beach. I, um, I... I... I made it. You did? Yeah. What’d you make? My picture. Oh, yeah. Are you feelin’ better? Much. Thanks. Nevada plates, huh? You from Vegas? Uh, no, no, uh... We’re, uh, uh, Reno. Reno. Reno. Let me get this. [exclaiming] Oh, Jesus! [all laughing] [clears throat] Uh-oh. Pete is hurt. I’ll go get the first aid kit. [Jimmy] All right. What’s up with your thumb? I hurt it. What’s with the robe? I took a shower. Um, didn’t you say there... There... There were some tools I could use? They’re... They're out back in the shed. Oh, great. Could you get ’em for me, please? -Yeah. -Thanks. Ouch. What’re you doin' with him? Are you startin’ somethin'? Oh, come on. I’m just teasin' him a little. Well, don’t be havin' so much fun. This isn’t a game, you know. Yeah, well, you get that goddamn car fixed and I will take care of the rest. Are you crazy? What are you doing with a gun? I am protecting myself. I swear to God, if Joey catches up with us, I’m dead. Believe me, Joey’s probably glad you left. I’m property to Joey Gallo. Something he owns. Besides the fact that fucking Feds are probably on my ass. Look, don’t worry about it, okay? I... I’ll... I’ll get the car fixed and... And you’ll be in Mexico by tomorrow. But just... Just put that goddamn thing away, all right? Now just put that goddamn thing away, all right? Don’t let me down, Pete. I got you this first aid kit and some overalls so you don’t get your nice clothes dirty. Oh, that’s very thoughtful, Clara. Thank you. I know. All right, well... All right, you call me when you hear something, okay? Yeah, I’ll make it right with you. Well, Chatty Cathy? My guy in the FBI says he’ll call when he hears somethin’. [birds chirping] [birds chirping] There you go, Pete. All better. Yeah, thanks. Now, I’ll get a lot done. [giggling] What? Pop’s overalls, they fit you good. Mmm. Yeah, they do, don’t they? [imitating trumpet playing] What? That. [car horn playing trumpet call] Hello, folks. I’m Harry James. Entrepreneur extraordinaire. Never fear, One-Stop Harry is here. Licensed to buy and sell anything. You name it, I can do it. Legally licensed in the State of California to perform weddings and bar mitzvahs! Shalom aleichem. My card, -[shrieking] -little lady. [chuckling] Not unusual. Not a bit unusual. A lot of ladies get excited the first time they meet me. [chuckling] Yeah. Men, too, sometimes. So this is the Nautilus. Good. Good. Good. Mighty fine place you got here. Kinda rustic. The Old West, right? -Yeah. -Good. -Good. -Do you think you can sell it? Oh, uh, you’re confused. I’m Harry James. I can sell anything. [Harry] Uh, you’re the Jimmy I talked to on the phone, right? [Jimmy] Yeah, that’s right. Hi. Well, good. Good. Uh, you don’t think this mustache makes me look too much like Adolf Hitler, do you? Uh, no. -Good. -Not-Not at all. Good. ’Cause you can't be too careful about image. That corner needs to be pushed back and solidified. It takes money. Hi, Dr. Roswell. -Hi, Jimmy. -Hi. -Oh, oh... -Harry James. Oh my gosh, Harry James! -How... How are you? -You see, excited. -Busy day. -Yeah. -Would you excuse us for just a minute, Harry? -Oh, sure, sure. You’re a busy man. Ladies. Thank you. I brought the commitment papers for you to sign. Great. Okay. Let’s go inside. -[music playing] -[Roswell] So, good news. I think we’ll have a room for Clara early next week. [Jimmy] You know, you... You said that it was going to be six months or at least a year. Well, we got lucky. I pulled some strings. Lucky. Uh-huh. Unless you need more time, you know. No. No. We’re ready. We’re ready. It's okay. You’re ready, right, Clara? To move to Sunny Hill? Yeah. Sunny Hill. There you go. So, what do you think? [Harry] I... I think [chuckling] we got a ball game. Excuse me, darlin’, could, uh, could you just move over just a little bit? Um, you know, I have some paperwork to do. I’ll just scoot back here. [Harry] All right. We got a ball game. Now, this here is your standard listing agreement. It gives me exclusive rights to represent the property. I need you to sign this before I can take any offers from buyers. How much do you think I can get for this place? The question is how much do you want? Go ahead, let yourself dream. Name a figure, any figure. Be ambitious. How much do you really want? $100,000. -$100,000? -Uh-huh. I don’t think so. Well, this is a great place. This is a fully functioning business. We sit on 20 acres of land. It’s six and a half miles off the interstate on a dirt road. Well, how much then? Depends. Uh, you got clear title? Any mortgages? No, no. We own it free and clear. How soon do you want to be out of here? Well, as soon as possible. How’s the end of the week? Are you kidding? You really think that you can sell this place by the end of the week? I guarantee it. Trust me. If I don’t have this place sold, if I don’t have cash in your pocket, if I don’t get you $35,000 by the end of the week, I’ll eat a bug. That’s not enough. Okay, I’ll eat two bugs then. No. This place is worth at least $80,000. [sighing] It’s run down. Where does that door go? That, um... That goes to the storage room and then down to the basement. I’ll need to see the basement. -[Roswell] Jimmy? -Be my guest. Thank you. Any more episodes? Yeah. Yeah, she had one this morning. Really? Clara, come here, honey. Dr. Roswell, this is Frances. She... She doesn’t know anything about me having Williams Syndrome, -and... And that it’s... -Breathe. ...nobody’s fault and... And that, that I’m not retarded, uh, just different, and that my math is unpredictable. I can play any music I hear. And I can hear everything. Yeah, how can she do that, Doc? Hear everything, I mean. We were way down the road, about a mile or so. She could hear everything we said. You don’t mind, Clara? Frances is my friend. Uh, Williams Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder. People like Clara are gifted and also somewhat inept. Many of these children demonstrate a great deal of intelligence in language and music as well as hyperacusis. Hyper what? Hyperacusis. Sensitive hearing. Yeah, but, you said children. Yes. Clara has the developmental IQ of a 10-year-old. But I have the genius of a normal person. You sure do. I’ll see you next week, okay? Oh! I almost forgot the commitment papers. Yeah, right. Thanks. Really is for the best, you know. I know. Bye, Dr. Roswell. [Harry] Hey, Jimmy, come here and look at this, would you? [door thudding] Is that Pop’s robe? Mine didn’t fit. Never looked that good on my dad. [giggles] That... That... That does look really nice on you, Pop’s robe. If you wanna be outta here in a week, you gotta make concessions. All right, all right. I’ll take $45,000. But I know that you can get more. I’ll get you what I can. Trust me. [stuttering] In a week? Harry’s helping us sell the Nautilus, remember? So you can go to Sunny Hill? Yes. There’ll be no more Nautilus. You know, I’ll... I'll get you the best deal that I can, but that’s what I say off the top of my head. Uh, what about the money? Certified check. Take it right down to the bank, cash it, put it in your pocket. Could you work a car into the deal? Sure, sure, sure, we can work a deal. A brand-new car? Sure, a brand-new car, of course. Or a used car. Get you a better deal on a used car. It won’t cost you a dime. Work it right into the deal. -Okay, wait. What if... What if I... -Sure, we’ll work in the tax. I’ll take good care of you. Trust me. A real good brand-new used car. What? Sure. You can trust me. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Harry, Harry. You just said, "a brand-new used car." What’s that? Driven a short distance from the train to the sales lot. Huh? Sure. Instead of being trucked in, it’ll have maybe 30, maybe 50 miles on it, on the odometer. Maybe a little more. Thirty miles? Sure. A brand-new used car. Now, it has be called used. It’ll have maybe 100, 200 miles on it. Anything over five miles is consider used. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that... That’s fine. As long as it doesn’t cost me anything extra, okay? Here you go. We’ll handle it right here on my back. There. Just use my back. Thank you very much. Could you get me a truck? Like yours. Well, that’s one-of-a-kind. But trust me, Jimmy. I will take extra good care of you. Won’t cost you a dime. Only 500 or 600 miles on it. Yeah. Ladies, it has been a pleasure. Hmm. Bye. Well, I guess that’s that. [truck engine starting] That’s what? Nothing. What would your father think of Mr. Harry James? Two of them would get along great. They’re a couple of self-made men. Oh, that’s right. Self-made. By the bootstraps, that’s what Pop used to say. [Jimmy] Yeah, by the bootstraps. He was a great man, wasn’t he, Jimmy? Oh, yeah. He was wonderful. That’s right. My mom was dying, you know, and he just wouldn’t leave her alone. He just pestered her and pestered her and just wouldn’t let her go peacefully. -Uh-oh! -What? Pete just hurt his other thumb. Jesus, it’s fuckin' hot! No shit, Sherlock. You say somethin’, Fat Louie? All right. Yeah, I... I figure they, uh, crossed into Mexico right about here. What do you think? [birds chirping] Oh, for a sub I could run him over. Ah, shit. Come on! Yeah, that’s funny. What are you doin’? The map. Fat Louie, we need the map. Which way is Mexico? That way. How many roads do you see there? One. Ergo? All right, I see your point. [speaking Italian] -Get in. -Come on. Let me drive. -It’s my turn. Get in. -Let me drive! Get in. It’s my turn. It’s my turn to drive, Fat Louie. -[piano playing] -This fish is really good. I mean, he knows I wanna make him blink, so that’s why he’s not lookin' at me. Are you? [Clara] You have to be very powerful to make Charlie blink. Did you ever make him blink? I never tried. Why don’t you just forget about that fish and go fix the damn car? You don’t need a free meal. Ah, ah, ah, this... this is bigger than a... Than a free meal. Charlie says he knows you. Really? [stammers] What does he know? He knows that you’ve been traveling for a very long time [chuckles] and never had a home. Where does Charlie say I’m goin'? He says you’re not going anywhere anymore. Charlie’s a real smart aleck, isn’t he? He knows everything. He’s very wise. If Charlie’s so goddamn wise, why is he trapped in that little tank? He’s trapped in there because he’s waiting for you to make him another one. [Pete] Clara, Clara, c-come here, come here, come here. Watch, watch, watch. I’m gonna make him blink. Watch. -Boo! -[gasps] Blink, you son-of-a-bitch. Come on. [in husky voice] Whoo! You’re just trying to scare me. It’s not gonna work. Nope, nope, nope. -[Clara gasps] -[Pete] He blinked. He... He blinked. He blinked. [stuttering] I did it. He blink... You see him blink? He... You saw it, right? He did it, he did it, right? He blinked. He blinked. [Clara breathing heavily] He did it just for you. [Jimmy] Charlie did not blink. Everybody knows that fish don’t blink. ♪ Make Charlie blink Make Charlie blink ♪ ♪ Make Charlie blink And win a free meal ♪ ♪ Make Charlie blink ♪ ♪ Make Charlie blink And get a free meal ♪ What are you doing? Well, Pete made Charlie blink. He gets a free meal. -[pans clanging] -Oh, no. No. Pete’s not getting free anything. God damn it, Clara, knock it off! Now you’re blathering on like an idiot. Hey, don’t talk to her like that, all right? I will talk to her however I want to because she is my sister. She doesn’t need you or anybody else defending her, because she’s got me. I love her and I know what’s best for her. That’s not true. You want to send me to Sunny Hill and that’s not just fine. Not. Not. Oh, come on, Clara! We talked about this. No, you talked. You didn’t listen. I don’t want it. I like it here just fine. I think we should stay here in the Nautilus. Just stay here in the Nautilus. God damn it, Clara, this is not about me, this is about you! I made this decision in your best interest. This was a very difficult decision, but I’ve made it and we’re doing it. Do you understand? Okay. Okay. Okay, but Pete still gets a free meal. He made Charlie blink. Fair is fair! Fine. You want to give Pete a free meal? Charlie is Pete’s free meal! So you get Charlie out of the tank, and you skin him and you bone him and you cook him up. Serve Charlie to Pete! Okay! Okay, okay. -Clara... -Come on. Knock it off! -Come on, stop it. Clara. -Don’t you touch her! Oh, my God. [stammering] Jesus, I didn’t mean... I... I didn’t mean to do that. I’m sorry. That... I... I didn’t mean to do that. I didn’t mean to do that. [stuttering] Look, that was an accident. Are you okay? [Clara] Pete’s gonna be okay. [groaning softly] Shit. [Jimmy] Oh! God damn this place. God damn it all to hell! Get him up and I want the both of you out of here right now! No. No? Pete and Frances are my friends. They can stay here as long as they like! Fine! They can stay. You can stay. I can stay. We’ll all stay here! I hope you’re happy!

[clearing throat] Yes, I... I am. I am, uh... I am definitely drunk. [chuckling] Where’s your boyfriend? Pete’s not my boyfriend. Do you know that I am 30 years old and I have never been out of Dickenson County? So you stayed here? Just stayed here, just like Charlie, floatin’ around in my own muck. Don’t you think that I have a... a right to, you know, to get out, go see the world? Well, sure you do. It’s a basic human instinct. You know what the difference is between you and me? I have responsibility. And I stay here and I take care of my responsibility. Well, la-di-fuckin’-da. See I... I can’t just run off to Mexico at the drop of a hat. It’s not the drop of a hat. Because I stay here through thick and thin. Terrific! -Hey, I’m talkin' to you. -Don’t touch me! Come here, sit down. We’ll arm wrestle. -Arm wrestle? -Come on. If, uh... [laughs] If I win, then, uh, then you’re gonna stay here and take care of Clara and I’m gonna go to Mexico. If you win, you go to Mexico, but I’m going with you. All right. [Jimmy] Okay. Uh, before we... before we start, I should tell you that I have... Have a little experience arm wrestling. See, um, when Pop would get drunk, he would say, uh, "Come here, boy! "Let’s see what kind of man you are." Then he would... He would take my hand like this, and bang, bang, bang, bang! Stop it, Jimmy! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [sighing] [laughing] What? What is... What... What, did I... Did I do something wrong? No, no. [stuttering] It’s just that, It’s... It's been a long time. What? It’s been... It's been a, what, a long time since you were kissed? No. It’s been a long time since I liked being kissed. [door opening] Oh. Hey, Jimmy. I heard banging. Frances, I... What are you guys doing? [both] Um... -Jim... Jimmy was... -Nothin’. Does your back hurt, Frances? Well, actually, Jimmy was helpin’ me with my back. Yeah. She... She... I fixed it for her. Oh. Well, I... I better, um... [laughs] I think I should go. [both] Um... No, no. I’m tired. [yawning] Good night. [both laughing] [birds chirping] -Oh. -Hey. [sighing] [laughs] Well, I think we handled that pretty well. You were great, Pete. You know, I-I love to cook. Really? Yeah. That’s very provocative. Provocative? Think so? Never thought of it like that. Provocative. Oh, here. Here’s your tip. Thanks. Oh. You know what? You think, uh, old Charlie over there would like some fries? Yes. Yes. Yes, very much. There you go, Charlie. There you go. Um, I’m gonna go out and... And fix that car. Okay. [sighing] Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Oh, yes. I think so, too, Charlie. [birds chirping] [whispering] Run a check on a Dodge with Nevada plates. 5-7-6-Jackson-Henry-Henry. Pow! -Yes! We got ’em, Fat Louie. We got ’em. -Hey. Some deputy sheriff called in the plates at some place called the Nautilus. Get in! [birds chirping] You’re sure of that plate number? [Kelly] Yes, sir. License tags match. I’ll meet your agents at mile marker 1-7-4. Don’t be late there, Sheriff Kelly. I don’t want my agents sittin’ in the desert roastin’ their nuts off waitin’ on you, you got that? Oh. [chuckles nervously] Yes, sir. You know you federal boys can always count on me. And, uh, well, I’d just like to say, as one law enforcement professional to another, that, uh, it is my honor to... Let’s go. [dial tone droning] Hello? Hello? [birds chirping] [sighing] [laughs] Good. [car horn playing trumpet call] Howdy, pard. How’re you doin'? -Good. -Ooh, looks like that smarts, huh? -Little bit. -Yeah. Oh, what you got here, huh? Oh! No, this thing’ll never run again. The engine’s blown. No. I can fix it. No, no way. It’s... Your block’s cracked. [Harry] What’s wrong with that guy? That car can’t be fixed. Hold on, hold on. Now you remember me. I’m Harry James. Oh, yes. Harry James. You’re gonna sell the Nautilus. That’s right. Where’s Jimmy? Jimmy? Yes, Jimmy. I... Seems like I walked off yesterday with the wrong paper. The... These are for, uh, Sunny Hill. Oh! Oh, well, um, um, Jimmy’s, uh, gone. I’m-I'm sorry. I guess you’re gonna have to be gone, too, Mr. Harry James. Do you know where Jimmy is? No. Do you know when he’ll be back? No. Do you know if he’s coming back soon? No. He... He’s not comin’ back soon, or... or you don’t know? Who? Jimmy! Oh, yes, Jimmy. Yes, he’s, uh, he- he’s coming back soon. [Harry] Good, good, soon. -Good. -Need... Need help. Well, I’m here to help you. Oh, I don’t think so, Mr. Harry James. Goodbye. Goodbye, goodbye, Mr. Harry James. Well, you tell Jimmy I was here and, uh, I’ll have y'all out of here in a week. [stuttering] Oh, well, I don’t think Jimmy’s coming back. What? But, you just said that... [stuttering] Oh, no, no, no. He’s not coming back. Definitely not coming back. Well, how can you be so sure? He’s dead. Jimmy’s dead? Yes. Where’s the body? He took it with him. Are you lying to me? Yes. Why? Because I want you to go away. [Harry] Why? Because you want to sell the Nautilus. [sighing] I’m so sorry you dislike me so much. [stuttering] Oh. I don’t dislike you. Well, people see me on my commercials and they think I’m some sort of shyster or... Or con man. They... They don’t realize I have feelings. They don’t know the real me. Well, I know the real you. --[chuckling] You do? -Mmm-hmm. What do you know about me? Well, I... I know you’re obnoxious. Where’d you learn that? Um, from-from Leonard. He says you’re the most obnoxious man in the whole wide world. You know, he’s right. I am. I am obnoxious. But you want to know what makes me so obnoxious? No. Makin’ people happy. That’s my job. The happier I make them, the more obnoxious I become. That’s what obnoxious means. Makin’ people happy. Then why are you selling the Nautilus? To make Jimmy happy. Oh. You know he’s not happy, don’t you? Well, y-yes, um, yes, he thinks he wants to go away. When I sell the Nautilus, Jimmy will be happy. Oh, yes. Who would buy the Nautilus? [razzing] I don’t know. Somebody. Why? Oh, lots of reasons. Um, maybe city folks wantin’ a place to retire. Oh. Or, uh, somebody who wants to run a restaurant. Maybe you could buy the Nautilus. [chuckling] Oh, I couldn’t buy the Nautilus. I already own a half dozen businesses. I spend most of my time drivin’ in between them as it is. Oh, w-we have 20 acres. You could put everything here, have your own town, and then you wouldn’t have to drive. [Pete] That’s... That’s very smart. You could consolidate all your holdings. Yeah, I, uh... Well, that’s... Charlie would like that. Wha... The... The fish? The catfish. He says you could call it James Town like the pilgrims. [chuckling] What does Charlie know about pilgrims? [in husky voice] Shop at James Town, where every day is Thanksgiving. That’s, uh, Clara speaking for Charlie. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, right! Hmm. [laughing] Every day is Thanksgivin’. I like that. That’s smart. Yeah, yeah. Clara, you got a darn good head for business on you. He says, you could open a theme park. [in husky voice] Harry James World. Yes, yes. That’s good. Now, uh, if I was to buy the Nautilus, if I was to build James Town, would you sell me your half interest? Well, if it would make Jimmy happy... Oh, it’d make Jimmy very happy. Okay. Oh, good! Good. Good. Jimmy agreed to $45,000. What if I make it an even $50,000? Um, well, uh, don’t forget you promised Jimmy a car. He can come down to the lot, pick out any car he likes. Or truck. Or truck. He really likes your big green truck. I really like my big green truck. It would make you very, very obnoxious. All right, [stammers] what the hell? [laughing] Here are the keys. Oh, but wait! I’ll need your signature right... here. There you go. I don’t have a ride. Uh, could I borrow that big green truck till later? If you promise to be very careful. Oh, I’ll treat it like it was my very own. Here we go. Thank you. Bye. Bye. You know, um, that’s not what obnoxious means. -I know. -I know. Is it true about, um, the car being broken? Yeah. Yeah, I just, uh... I just don’t want to tell her right yet, okay? -Okay. -Okay. Well, why? -Well, I... -[both laughing] You see, I just... I just wanna break it to her gradually, you know. Oh, that’s very considerate. You missed a spot. -[birds chirping] -[Pete] Okay, now, we need a piece for the anchor winch right here. -How about this? -Okay. -Now if you move it up here like this... -Jesus! ...there’s more room for stuff down here. [Frances] How’s the car comin', Pete? Um, it’s... It’s gettin' close. Maybe tomorrow. What the hell have you been doin’ all day? Did you hear me? Everything is as exactly where it was yesterday. I’m still workin' on it. You ain’t been doin' shit! Pete, we gotta get outta here today. You know that. And what are you doing? You’re playin' around with goddamn toys! -Will you take it easy? -Take it easy? -Relax! -Relax? Yeah. Could everybody just relax? Jimmy has a little bit of a headache this morning. Thank you. What’s goin' on? Oh, um, Pete... Pete cooked breakfast and it was dee-licious! Yeah, Clara and I took care of the morning crowd and... You know, Clara and I make a great team. Pete cooked and-and I waited tables, just like you and I do all the time except Pete loves to cook and you don’t. He’s very provocative. You look like you can use some coffee. Oh, that’d be great. Hey, how’s your head? Oh, it’ll... It’ll be fine. Thanks. I’m really sorry about that. That’s okay. I don’t believe this. When are you going to fix the goddamn car, Pete? Don’t worry. I’ll take care of it. No, you’re not gonna take care of shit. You know why? ’Cause you're a loser. You’re a goddamn loser. At least I’m not a whore. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Frances. Frances. Pete is not a lazy... [stammers] What you said. He... He works hard. He... He cooked all the food and he painted the trim. He even fixed the door and he... He promised to build Jimmy a new tank. Charlie, you mean, Charlie. You said "Jimmy." I know what I said, so don’t look at me in that tone of voice. I know you want to take Jimmy with you to Mexico and I know he wants to go and that’s okay, ’cause it's just basic human instinct and that’s okay. But nobody can tell me that I have to like it, okay? Okay. Okay. -Okay. -Okay. Don’t look at me like that. Like what? Like you feel sorry for me. Horsedick sausages. Leonard says he wants two fat horsedick sausages and scrambled eggs and coffee. Two fat horsedick sausages comin’ right up. I’m gonna go look at your car. [Pete] Oh, you know what, don’t bother. It's fine. It’s not a problem. [birds chirping] What the hell is a horsedick sausage? This one’s for her. [bird cawing] Right in that sweet little brain. -[speaking Italian] -Mmm. Wipe your fingerprints off the shell. Here’s that cop right on time. Remember, keep your mouth shut and put that thing away. Now. All right. Okay, okay. Officer Kelly? I’m Special Agent Maxwell. This is Special Agent Myers. You boys are from Nevada? Tags are from Nevada. Uh, we work undercover. Deep undercover. Hey, now before we get goin’, let me warn you about somethin’. On the drive in, don’t have no conversation between the two of you. There’s this girl that lives over there. This, uh, freak mental case, retard, something, I don’t know. Anyway, she could hear a dog fart in a snowstorm. [laughing] Know what I’m sayin'? The point is, if we were any closer to the diner, she could hear us right now. Understand? Yeah, right. We understand. We’ll follow you in. You do that. [engine starting] [tires screech] [birds chirping] Well? Well, I, um... I’ve decided that I like you. [shushing] I’m trying to hear what they’re saying. Every guy likes me. Didn’t you hear what Pete said? Yeah, well, I’m not talkin' about them. I’m talkin' about me. I know that-that this sounds crazy, but I want you to stay here with me. Just for... for a couple of weeks. Maybe a month. You’re not sellin' the place? No. No, I need more time. Oh, Jimmy, come on. Just you and me. We’ll learn Spanish, grow long mustaches, and-and sip tequila and wear big sombreros and run from the Federales. I... I just need a little more time. Like maybe a month. I don’t have a month. I gotta go today. Please come with me. I know. It’s not nice to eavesdrop, but... Shh. I need you. Clara needs me, too. Frances, look, you... You don’t understand. I promised my mom that I would always take care of Clara. Now, it takes guts to stay and look after the people that you love. [crying] Not if you hide behind it, Jimmy. [sobbing] You believe that shit about the girl hearing us? Used to have a guy who ran numbers for us. Kept it all up here. Never used a scrap of paper and never missed a bet. A lot of people thought he was retarded, but he wasn’t. He was just different. Yeah. So what the hell’s that got to do with the girl hearing us? God compensates. If He takes away one thing, He usually makes it up someplace else. Yeah, well, not with Joey Gallo. Pete, do you know what’s wrong with your car? Have you seen the big pool of oil underneath it? Oh. Yeah, I know, [stuttering] I saw the leak. It’s not a leak. Your engine block is cracked. I, uh, saw that part, too. You can’t fix that. [stuttering] No, I know I can’t. I just can’t tell her. [snorting] Well, don’t you think you should? Yeah. See... The... The thing is... [stuttering] I mean, she’d kill me. Oh. No. She’s... She is not gonna kill you. She will. She will kill me. Why don’t you tell her? [chuckles] It’s not my problem. It’s your job, pal. [Pete] How about, Clara? She could tell her. No. Clara’s not gonna tell her anything. [imitating trumpet playing] Mr. Harry James is coming. Clara, would you please go to the trailer and tell Frances that Pete needs to talk to her, right now? It’s very important. [sighing] Okay. Thank you. [car horn playing trumpet call] Why don’t you ask Harry James to sell you a car? I’m sure he’ll make you a deal. That’s what he does. No, you don’t understand. I... I... I... don’t have any money. Maybe you and Frances could stay here for, like, a week or two, -and-and Leonard will give you a job. -Hmm. You’ll be able to save up enough money for a down payment. Yeah. You don’t understand. She... She’s not gonna like this. I mean, she... She wants to be in Mexico by... By today. Well, look, we’ll figure out something, I’m sure. Will you give me a hand with these boxes? -Yeah. -Let me get the door. [birds chirping] Hey, partner. How goes it? Uh, do you mind givin’ me a hand? We’re gonna set the pens up over there. Pens? Yeah, for the turkeys. I got about 100 of those suckers comin’ in later on today. [Leonard] I’ll bet you do. Look at this. Lifetime full of shit. You’re not gonna save any of it? Why should I? Most of this junk belonged to Pop, anyway. Good riddance. Hey, it’s a letter to you. What’s wrong? You all right? Frances says she’s already in the middle of her shower, and... And who do you think you are, talking to her like that, and um, and, uh, she can’t come now and that, uh, Pete is a loser, which he’s not, and, uh... What? Oh! Her hair is splitting ends. Tell her, tell her, uh, okay. Okay. Listen, I’m, uh, I'm sorry. [Leonard sighing] Hey, what’s wrong? What-What is it? This... is my acceptance letter to the Merchant Marine Academy. [chuckling] Congratulations! It’s 15 years too late. Fuckin’ post office! Jesus. Leonard, this isn’t the post office. Pop hid this from me. He opened it, he read it, he knew that I was accepted, and he hid it from me to keep me here! He kept you here? Come on, grow up. You could have left anytime you wanted to. No. That’s bullshit! Who would have taken care of Clara? Clara would take care of Clara! The real reason you never left, ’cause you're just like your old man. You are afraid. Look at this place. You think he wanted to stay here? He was always dreamin’ of gettin' out, goin’ places, seein’ the world. When Clara was born sick, well, he just never left. He wanted to leave. He never did. Just like you. Hey, Clara, you got somethin’ else besides this robe I could wear? I... I just don’t want that geek, Harry James, gawkin’ at me, you know. Well, you could, um, help yourself to my Mom’s stuff. Doesn’t fit me anyway. Really? Frances, you could hide here. Nobody would know. You’d be safe. Thank you, Clara. You know, that guy Pete might not be able to fix a car worth a damn, but he sure knows how to cook. He told me that he was a cook in the Merchant Marines. He really is a nice guy. [Harry] Of course, I can sell you a car, son. Of course I can. Now, tell me somethin’. How much money you got to spend? Um, uh, $20. I can’t help you, son. Maybe Jimmy here can lend you some money. I don’t have any money. You do now. Here it is, Jimbo. A genuine, certified, Harry James Incorporated check for $50,000. Wow. Oh, my God. It’s $50,000. You-You found a buyer? Yes, sir, I surely did. Me. Didn’t Clara tell you? No. Well, isn’t that just like the little darlin’? She’s a smart one, she is. She’s the one that convinced me to move all my operations over here to this property. "James Town, where every day is Thanksgivin’." I like it better and better each time I say it. That’s what this pilgrim thing is all about. Now, what we’re gonna have. We’re gonna have a strip mall with restaurants, a full service truck stop, beauty parlors, department stores and then the piece de resistances, my very own theme park! It’s gonna be stupendous. It’s absolutely wonderful. I changed my mind. You what? I changed my mind. Oh, no, son. You can’t change your mind. I got a signed contract right here endorsed by your sister, Clara. No, no, no, no. Clara would never do that. Why, it’s her signature right there. And she had me sign over title to my big green truck, per her instructions. Uh, there it is in your name. And here are the keys. No, no. Look, I don’t... I don’t want the keys. My name is not Jimbo. And I want you to wait right here, ’cause I'm gonna go talk to Clara -and I’m gonna find out what this is all about. -But she... You see, this right here is his name and she signed it. She signed it right there. Theme park? [birds chirping] Clara? Why did you sign Harry James’ contract? Because I wanted to... I wanted to make you happy. I can make myself happy. I... I didn’t need you to do that. I know. I know. Me, too. I guess I’ve grown up to be just like Pop, huh? Almost. No. Pop was older. Come on. Okay. [Harry] Mmm. You know, you’re right. That is the best soup I ever tasted. Oh, thank you. Now, what about that car? [Pete] I told you. I don’t want it. [Harry] It runs like a dream. We already got a car. Oh, not without an engine, you don’t. What do you mean, "not without an engine"? Didn’t he tell you? [stammers] I wanted to tell you. He was gonna break it to you gradually. That was real thoughtful of him. I know. Pete, can I have some soup? Tell you what I’m gonna do. I’m gonna throw in that car free of charge, just to make everybody happy. I’m not happy. Cash that check and you’ll be happy. I’m not selling the Nautilus. It’s already sold. Clara and I agreed yesterday. Oh, yes. Yes, we did, but I’m goofy. Honey, goofy or not, it’s a done deal. I got Clara’s signature and all I need is yours. I’m not signing. I gave you my big green truck. Well, you can have your big green truck back. [scoffs] I don’t want my big green truck back. I want James Town. Well, you can’t have James Town. I’m not selling. I’m not used to beggin'. I know. I wish there was another way. Me, too. All right, all right. Y’all give me no choice. Jimmy, you sign that contract or... Or the fish gets it. God, Jimmy, no! [Harry breathing heavily] Jimmy, you know, I must have picked up the wrong papers when I was here last week... Hi. I see I’ve come at a bad time. I’ll just come back later when there’s less shotguns. No! Stop right there. Get over there with everybody else. Have some soup. Yeah, that’s a good idea. I’ll have some more soup, too. No! Nobody gets any more soup until Jimmy signs the contract. Oh, come on, Harry. This is stupid. Jimmy. Jimmy, need help. [sirens wailing] Bad news, Jimmy! Jimmy! [tires screeching] This is the FBI. Come out with your hands up. FBI? No, it... I didn’t. It... It wasn’t me. It was somebody who... [gun firing] [Roswell screaming] Stay back! I got hostages. And I’m not afraid to shoot one. [whimpering] The pilgrim’s the first one to get it. Come on, Frances. Shut up, Pete. What are you doing? I’m not going back. Going back where? Why is the FBI here? Because she saw her boyfriend, um, kill a guy. Joey Gallo. [Frances] I did not. I walked into the room and the guy was already on the floor. And then Joey was holdin’ a gun while he was standing over him. Shut up, Pete! You’re Joey Gallo's girlfriend? Well, it’s... It's more like property. [panting] Jimmy, you gotta understand. I was really scared and... And Joey, he protected me. It was the first time in my whole life I ever felt safe to go to sleep at night. Stay there. I wouldn’t last five minutes in the Witness Protection Program. The Gallos would find me in a second. Clara, you go get me some rope, okay? Rope. Yes. Frances, I mean... Where you gonna go? I’m gonna take that truck and I’m gonna go into Mexico just like I planned. That’s a good girl. Now Pete, you go over there and tie everybody up. Jimmy, you help him. Everybody except Harry James. You’re comin' with me. Help me. Help me. Frances, I don’t want you to get hurt. Please give me the gun. No way. I’m gettin' outta here. And if anybody tries anything, I’m gonna blow Harry James’ brains out! Listen to him. He... He’s right. I... I can help you. -My brother-in-law’s an attorney. -Shut up, asshole! Frances, stop. Think what you’re doing. I swear I’ll kill him. Then I’ll kill myself. -Oh! -Don’t! Stay back, Jimmy. Oh, Frances. Frances, you’re our friend. [whispering] Clara. Clara. Frances, no. You’re our friend. [Jimmy yelling] Clara, don’t! [sobbing] [crying] No! Okay. Shh! It’s all right. It’s all right. It’s all right. It’s all right. Can I have a bowl of soup? I’ll have a bowl of soup. All right! Nobody move! Everybody on the floor! No, Kelly. We’re not gettin’ on the floor and I’m not a retard. Hello, baby. -Joey? -Sit down and relax. Why are you so surprised? Should’ve known I’d be coming for you. Give me your gun. You... What are you talkin’ about? Hey, I’m the law here! Yeah, well, not anymore. Sit down. Sit down! Hey, make yourself useful. Tie the cop and the pilgrim up. Yeah, first get me a cup of coffee. Somebody. Oh, I’ll get you a cup of coffee. Okay, hero. Be cool. [Pete] You know what, Joey, you don’t have to kill her. She’s gonna be down in Mexico, anyway. Too late, Pete. Way too late. Sorry, Baby, nothing personal. You understand. It looks kind of personal. Hey, are you gonna help? This is your show. I’m just along to supervise. Hmm. Nice coffee. -Oh, thank you. I use a touch of cinnamon. -[Louie] Ah! Adds a little perk to it. Pete! Tie ’em up. No, Joey, wait. Let everybody go. I’ll do whatever you say. -Joey, please, come on. -Aw, Frances, please. You know it ain’t gonna work that way. All right, everyone’s seen me here. Now, all right, just... What are you gonna do? Shoot us all? Mr. Fat Louie, I don’t wanna die. Yeah, talk to him! Hey, all of you, shut the fuck up, all right? Do what I tell you to do. -Hey, hey, hey, hey! -Jimmy! Don’t move! All right, take him, Fat Louie. Take him now! You move and I blow his head off, I swear. Harry, give me the keys. [muttering] Come on. Frances, take ’em. Huh? Go on. Get outta here. Go. Oh, God, Jimmy. -[groans] -[Frances] No! [Clara imitating police siren] What the hell? Dispatch. Dispatch all units. [Clara imitating sirens wailing] All units. All units to the Nautilus diner. Dispatch, dispatch. What the hell? She hears the police. They’re coming. They’re coming. How far away are they, Clara? They’re not very far. They’re just right over there. [chuckling] It’s the State Police. [Clara] Air dispatch. Air dispatch. Fat Louie, is she for real? Air dispatch. Air dispatch. [imitating helicopter rotors whipping] [Clara] Move in on my command. Armed... -We need to leave. -Hey. But... I’ll take care of this. Go. [Clara continues imitating siren] [gun firing] [Frances shrieking] You, get lost. He won’t follow you no more. He thinks you’re dead. Don’t disappoint him. The rest of you, this never happened! [speaking Italian] [Louie] Good. Uh, remember what I said. Get lost and... And stay lost! [Pete] Frances, you better beat it, all right? The State Police are gonna be here anytime. What about James Town? Well, maybe Clara will sell you 20 acres. Then you can have your James Town. But never the Nautilus. Never the Nautilus. Is it a deal? Can Jimmy still have your big truck? It’s already his. Okay. Clara? Is it okay? [stammers] I don’t know. What does Charlie say? Oh. He-He says, uh, swim away. No more muck. Swim away. -Okay. -Okay. Thank you, but no thank you, to Sunny Hill. Clara’s stayin' home. I understand. [Pete] Frances. Okay, uh, stay clear of the Federales, okay? You’re not comin' with us? [sighing] No. I... I, uh... I kind of like it here. It’s kinda like a home. I love you. -I love you. -I love you, too. -Bye. -Bye. Be safe. Get outta here, guys. Be safe, all right? [Jimmy] Bye. [sighing] Okay. Who wants somethin’ to eat, huh? I... I... I’d love to have some more soup, -if... If you wouldn’t mind untying me. -Oh. -[piano playing] -Us. [Kelly] And what about us? Oh, thank you. -Think I’ll wait till Frances gets to Mexico. -Here you go. Besides, it looks like you can use a pit stop. [Harry grunting] Hey, Clara, do you think we have enough food for the State Police? What State Police? Don’t you remember the helicopters with the... [imitating helicopter whirring] You know what, Clara? You’re smarter than all of us put together. [giggling] [birds chirping]
