[music playing] Disarmament was almost complete when the bacteriological wars began. The plagues that followed slowly killed all of the men. And only a handful of females survived-- one rose to dominate the world. Using her dark powers, she began to breed a new race of women. And those who opposed her, were hunted down like animals. [music playing] [gun shots] [gun shots] Damn! Reverend Mother, Keela has escaped. And the seed? Is it all right, Cobalt? Destroyed in seconds. The seed was irreplaceable. My genetic program, ruined by your stupidity, breeder. We had a chance to repopulate the Earth. And you have perverted it! Show more respect for the Reverend Mother. Do you think I spend a lifetime purifying the gene pool for humanity's sake? Don't be so naive, child. We must find the breeder's assistant, Keela. [music playing] Hold the breeder up, Cobalt. I want to feed my power. [screaming] But that's not enough for my power to grow. I must have a man, again. [music playing] She's over there. Cobalt will dig this one. Oh, you bitch. Nobody gets away from Riptide. [music playing] Get out of here! [crying] Who are you? Phoenix, a sand trapper. These bounty hunters and bad news. We've got to get the hell out of here. OK? [music playing] [gun shots] All right, what the hell was that about? I can't tell you. You can't tell me? I'm risking my ass out here for you. The least you can do is tell me what's going on. Please, just get me to safety. All right. But when we get out of here, you're telling me what's happening. Come on, Keela. Come on. Come on. Come on, keep going. I'm too tired! I can't go on! - Come on! Phoenix, no! Oh god, come on! God, no! [music playing] Ah, it's been fun. [inaudible] Shit! Oh, Phoenix, are you all right? [inaudible] Get up, Phoenix. [music playing] Shit! Drop the sword. Make me Oh, that'll be easy. [gunshot] Let's get out of here. Cobalt, she's escaped. What? You let an inexperienced child escape you? She's with a sand trapper. A sand trapper? She killed Riptide and Whiplash. Now they've headed out into the desert. She will not get out of the desert alive. We are going hunting. [music playing] All right, Keela, I told you I'd get you to safety. And now you're safe. Why are they after you? The breeders devised a plan to free us from the Reverend Mother's breeding control. And they took a seed-- a male seed. And I carry it now. What do you mean? I'm with child-- a male child. If what you say is true, then we are in great danger. There's a place I know where we can hide. [music playing] Come on, where are you, my little squirrelys? Squirrelys, Squirrelys. I love hunting. I suppose there's gonna be a good reward for this one. Greater than your wildest dreams. What makes you think you're going to be the one to collect? [music playing] Cobalt, look-- tracks. We've got them. [music playing] Reverend Mother, she has escaped. I don't know where. But I swear I will find them. And when I catch Keela and that trapper, I'm gonna tear them apart. There there, Cobalt. Relax. Come here, child. Do not fear, my child. We shall find them. The seed that Keela carries is special. Special? Yes. The child that grows from it. Will feed my power like no male has before. From the instant of his birth, we will be as one. [music playing] KEELA: [moaning in pain] PHOENIX: Yes, that's it. Push! [screaming] PHOENIX: Yes, [inaudible]. Push! Push! [baby crying] It's a boy! It's a boy! It's a boy, so wonderful! [crying] [baby crying] The child has been born. I can feel it. I can feel it, yes. I don't feel right about you leaving now. Keela, I will only be hunting for a few days. Besides, we're low on supplies. Phoenix, please be careful. You're the only family I have. Not anymore. Take care of Skyler while I'm gone. I'll see you see, Keela. Be careful. OK. [baby crying] I don't like the idea of men around here. They screwed up the world once, and they'll do it again! Look at her. How could you turn over to the wolves? I say she stays. I don't want to hear anymore bullshit. [music playing] [gun shots] [baby crying] [gurgling] [baby crying] Jackpot. Drop the rifle. I've been waiting a long time for this one. [spits] [grunts] [laughing] Oh god. KEELA: What is it? What do you see? They're all dead. KEELA: Dead? What have I done? It's not your fault. It's Cobalt. That animal. I swear to God, she will pay for this 100 times over. Come on. [music playing] You know, Skyler, some day you will be the greatest fighter in the wasteland. Good hunting? Yeah, he got me again. Here you go. Well, how's everything? Good. He's really good. Is he good enough to handle the trip? Yeah. Yeah, he is. You know, it's time for us to go. We can't stay here forever. Eventually, Cobalt will find us. I suppose you're right. Remember that old sand trapper we met? She said there was some island in the sea. She showed it us. Right around here. I really hope so. That's our only chance. Yeah, my only concern is going through the Badlands. Just crawling with Rezule. We can get supplies and lose. It will be dangerous. Nobody has seen us in five years. Maybe we can sneak in unrecognized. Not we. I. [music playing] Reverend Mother. What is it, child? Why do you disturb my rest? A drifter claims to have seen something. What? Tracks. Two women, and perhaps a child. The boy? That, I do not know. But they found something. Give it to me. [music playing] I can feel it. This is the child's toy. Finally, we have found them. What is it? Shh. A shack. Looks abandoned. Perhaps. Let me go first. This close to Eluz we have to be cautious. Be careful. Yeah. [music playing] Looks like it's abandoned. Great, entertainment for men from before wars. You don't want to look at this. Hm, check it out. God, I hate being the hunted. I never thought I'd be glad to go into the Badlands. I'd be glad just to get some sleep. We staying the night here? Seems safe. You and Skyler stay here. When it gets dark, I'm going into Eluz for supplies. [music playing] Trapper, want a date? What'll be, sweetcheeks? Fill it up. Water. Canned goods. None of the nuked water. I want it cold. Just kidding. Got the cool H2O for you right here. What do you got for me? Hey, take it easy, all right? Just checking. Got a world full of people out there you just can't trust. So true. SHOPKEEPER: You wanna mess with this one? She's real mean. Damn trappers, anyone of them could be the one. [music playing] Holy shit. I think it's a man. Sure is. Do you know what this means? We have the last man on earth. s is fully grown. A man? I've never seen a man before. What? Well, how did you-- The breeders gave him to me. Oh, OK. Whatever you say. I'm real tempted to, uh-- To what? You know. Well, never mind. Oh. What's wrong? Shit. I think I broke it. Broke what? Oh. The only man in the wasteland, and I broke him. Damn! There's nothing more useless than a man who doesn't work. That way. Phoenix, he's come to. What the fuck are you doing in my hut? Your hut? I built it. I've been hiding here for years. Where the hell did you come from? You broken piece of shit. Easy, honey. I'm not good to you dead. You're no good to me alive. And I'm not your honey. Whatever you say. Where did you come from? I escaped from the Reverend Mother's seed tanks. That's impossible. The Reverend Mother killed the last remaining males years ago. You believe me, don't you? You can't trust him, Keela. Besides, we have to protect the child. Child? Yes, Skyler. A boy child? No shit. I never thought I'd ever see a kid again, let alone a boy. You're gonna take that secret to the grave. Phoenix, what is it? [music playing] They're here. Well, what about him? If they catch me, they'll kill me. I can get you out of here. How? Untie me first. Shit. All right. All right, show me. This shack is built over an old tunnel. It comes out on the other side of the hill. Look. It's blocked. PHOENIX: Can you clear it? I think so. PHOENIX: Then do it. I'll take care of them. [screams] I've got it. Just get the hell out of here. Give me the boy. Attaboy. Your turn. Phoenix, come on. Phoenix! Badger! The one in the bar. I sensed something wrong the moment I saw you. It's over! Trapper, I know the child is here. Rattail, search the shack. [playing pop goes the weasel] No! We had the child! He was ours! You will regret surviving, trapper. Damn you to hell, bitch! [laughing] After I finished with you, you will wish you were in hell. Shh. You've got spirit. I'll enjoy watching you die in the gladiators pits of Eluz. [coughing] I can't let her die. I'm sorry, but we've got to get out of here. Come on. No. [music playing] Well, what do we have here? Fresh meat. Think I'll eat her myself. Don't fuck with me! I've had a bad day. Nice stuff, kid. I can't wait to see you fight in the pits. Please? No way. I ain't going to Eluz. Please! She's my best friend! I'm sorry. But as far as I'm concerned, your friend can rot. I'm not gonna get caught, and get sent back to that sperm bank again. We need her! Well, maybe you need her, but I certainly don't. You can't let Phoenix die! Oh, yeah? Just watch me. I don't need you. I'll do it myself. I'll rescue her all myself. Fine. Go ahead. I don't care. I ain't going. I am Neon. Just to stay alive in here is not easy. I've killed over 30 women in this arena. You must be good. I survive. Right. Your name is Phoenix, right? I've heard rumors of a boy child protected by a trapper such as you. I've heard many rumors. Some true. And some aren't. I think you know more than you let on. But in here, it doesn't really matter. The only important thing is to survive. Eat. You'll need it. I don't want to hear about it. Please? I don't want to hear about it anymore. We could get a dune buggy in the commotion. Oh. Oh no, no you don't. A big, fast dune buggy. [click] I don't want to hear about it. [music playing] CROWD: Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! [grunting] Blondie, the winner! Phoenix, if we are matched together, fight hard. I'm sorry. I will have to kill you. OK, I'll help you. But I'm only in it for the dune buggy. You understand? If anything comes down, if there's any problems, it's every man for-- every woman for himself, so to speak. Thanks. Thanks so much. [clears throat] Our next bout will be a fun one. Straight from the wastelands, a newcomer and a real comer-- Phoenix, the warrior! [music playing] CROWD: [booing] Hey, Phoenix. For her opponent, a real favorite shit kicker-- Mohawk! Looks like I'm gonna have to teach that cunt some manners. [music playing] CROWD: Mohawk! Mohawk! Yeah! CROWD: Mohawk! Mohawk! [screams] How do you like it, bitch? CROWD: Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! What a bout, ladies and germs. And I do mean germs. The winner, Phoenix! For our next fight-- I want Phoenix to stay in this ring. You can't be serious! Phoenix is too good to waste. Deadly serious, you scum bucket. Ladies, there's been a change of schedule. Phoenix will fight the next fight! CROWD: [cheering] CROWD: Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! The winner, Phoenix! CROWD: [cheering] Her opponent, Neon! Shit, what do I do? CROWD: Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Phoenix! Phoenix! Keela lives! Phoenix! Where is he? He was supposed to meet us here. Hey! You need a lift? [inaudible] That was the deal. I help you. You got help. I get a car. I got a car. Nothing about me helping you through the Badlands. - We need your help. - Not again. I saved your asses once. That's enough for me. Give me a break. At least we left Cobalt and the Reverend Mother far behind. At least we're all together. Great. Yeah, wonderful. I will be all right. But I must have the child soon. Don't worry, Reverend Mother, I have a plan. Go. Go, you must not fail. You must hurry. I don't have much time left. Finally, all my years of waiting will come to an end. Through the child's death, my power will be unstopable. This is awful! Enjoy it. It's going to be the last meat we're going to have for a long time. We'll remember this meal fondly once we reach the Badlands. We? I've been thinking about this all day. And I figure it's like this, I either go back to Eluz or I follow two crazy broads to the Badlands. If I go back, sooner or later, I'll end up back in sperm banks. On the other hand, with my help you might have a chance of making it. I'm glad you're going with us. You know, I want to thank you again for, um, coming with us. Well, life sure is exciting around the three of you. That's for sure. You know, I really am happy that you came. Not that Phoenix isn't a good fighter or anything, but, you know-- The stars sure are beautiful tonight. Yeah, they sure are. Well, Guy-- What? What's this? Oh. Well-- Is it still broken? I don't think so. What are you so happy about? Hey look, do you want me to drive? Why? Well, you look exhausted. No, That's OK. Well, we're heading into the Badlands right now, so you have to be careful. I'll be fine. Do you really want to go through the Badlands? There's no other way. Besides, it's the only place that's out of the reach of the Reverend Mother. What? What? What is it now? I don't know. It looks like a canteen. KEELA: Great! Maybe there's some water in it! Not likely. Welcome to the Badlands. [music playing] The Reverend Mother is pleased. But we must hurry. The trap is set, even as I speak. You hear me, Phoenix! I swear by all that runs from the evil that men have spread on this planet. I will get you! You think you have escaped? But my arm is long. I swear to this, even into the Badlands. [music playing] KEELA: Well guys, looks like the end of the road. GUY: Great. This is all we need. Travel the Badlands on foot. You and your ideas. What's that? I don't know. Well, what is it? Let me see. What do you see? It's Rezule. What is this place? We stumbled onto a Rezule burial ground. Great. Terrific. What now, boss lady? We go on. Are you crazy? We can't go in there. Why not? Because I've never heard of anyone stumbling on to a Rezule burial ground and living to tell about it! Besides, the Rezule's will skin us alive if they catch us. The dead hold no threat to the living, Guy. Shit. Keela, you and Skyler stay here. Shit. [inaudible] [music playing] [inaudible] Go! GUY: Come on! Move it! Move it! Move it! Go! Go! KEELA: Come on, let's get of here! Can we get the hell of here now? Yeah! Go! Oh my god! Ah! [screams] Ah! You've done well, my friends. Bless you, Cobalt. Another male? Reverend Mother will be ecstatic. Give me the child and the male. And you can do what you want with the rest. No! He's a tough little howler. It's a shame he has to die to strengthen the Reverend Mother's power. Ouch! Run, Skyler! Run! Get the howler! Finally. We have done well. The child. The child. I have waited such a long time. You are the most nubile flesh we've had in years. The viddies will be pleased by the offer. At the hour of the primetime, we will cancel them. May the [inaudible] of the airwaves be satiated. IN UNISON: May the teleboxes speak again. (CHANTING) Nielsen. Nielsen. Nielsen. Nielsen. [music playing] I have another gift for you. A runaway male. How does it feel to be the last man on earth? How's it feel to be the ugliest thing around? Oh, Cobalt, you will have to work him very hard in my breeders tank to replenish the supply. I will be able to create a new race. I will be master of a new empire. What are we gonna do? I don't know. We can't give up hope. It's too late. The Reverend Mother has the child. [music playing] Come now, my pet. I worked very hard to create you. Finally, we meet. It is through you that my power will grow beyond comprehension. It is always the pity that I have to kill you in order to achieve my goal. (SINGING) [inaudible] Siskel and Ebert "At The Movies." "Chips." Run away with the Rich and Famous. "Leave it Beaver." With the ancient Rezules traveled the airwaves from telebox to telebox. Who released the cleansing fire from which the Rezule will form. A sharp, [inaudible] glass of a screen. (SINGING) [inaudible]. "Little House on the Prairie." "The Dick Van Dyke Show." "The Flinstones." "The Jetsons." "Sesame Street." I release your souls to the airwaves. Neon! [gun shots] Prepare yourself, boy. He's just a child. Take me. No. You are too old. I must assimilate this child. Which you can be certain and watch, if you'd like. Can you see the entrance from here? No. It's on the other side of Eluz. This is our only chance. It's the weakest link in her security. But we still need the diversion. By the time we get done, they won't know what hit them. Let's wait till nightfall, go in there, and kick some ass. [music playing] Well, it's now or never. This will wake them up. [gurgling] Ready? One, Two, Three! Shit! The wire's broken. Oh no. Is Rebels! Cover me! Neon! No! No! What is it? I don't know. I can take care of it. Do you need me here? No. No, go. I can handle it. [groaning] [thud] I think it's this way. What is this place, Keela? I don't know. I think the ancients used it for a safe place during the war. I don't like it. OK, come on. [music playing] Phoenix! You are dead! Keela, find another way in. Be careful. It's just you and me, Cobalt. It's too late! The child is ours! [scream] Phoenix! Your ear will be a nice addition to my collection. Good night, Phoenix. I want to see your face when I kill you. I'll watch your pretty face. [screams] The child is mine. Stop! The child is not yours. You can not have him. You're too late. There's nothing you can do to stop me now. My face will be the last think you will see. [screams] [music playing] Kneel! Damn you! You can not have my child! Stop! I command you. You can not do it. You are not strong enough for me. Don't you understand? I created all of you. There was nothing left after the great destruction. I am the only one of the ancients left. And you are all my children.
