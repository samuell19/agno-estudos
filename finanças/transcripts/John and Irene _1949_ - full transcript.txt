Saga Studio Presents A filmatization of Johannes Allen's novel "It Resides In All of Us". Script: Set Design: Cinematography: POLICE Criminal Investigation Service Please have a seat. So what's on your mind then? I'd like to tell you about... I ask you not to interrupt me with any questions. I'd like to tell you my story the way it really happened, without any interruptions, otherwise you won't understand my motives for acting the way I did. Fine. Go ahead. Please begin then. My name is Johannes Eriksen. I was born on the 30th of August, 1913, in Svendborg on Fyn. I call myself John. We ... the dancing couple, John and Irene... we went from town to town in our small car, performing in restaurants and wherever else they wanted us. By now it must be three weeks since we came to Oslo, after having done a brief gig in Fredrikstad. We've arrived, Irene. Let's go, Irene. What time is it? Ten past five. Will you be going to see them now? Yes. Trocadero - Oslo's biggest dance lounge Yes? Trocadero. Main booking? Here you go. I am John... The act you hired. What sort of act? - John & Irene. John & Irene? I haven't hired any John & Irene. Indeed you have. - What the fuck are you saying? Miss Fjeldhammer, get me those bills I mentioned. - Director Magnussen, the day before yesterday I called the Trocadero from Fredrikstad. I spoke with the director. I told him about our successes in Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense, Malmoe and Gothenburg. We discussed it and decided to accept the job in Oslo. The director said it suited him fine, he'd give us 40 kroner each evening. And there's just one Trocadero in Oslo, right? And you're its director, right? I have no use for you. -I wouldn't know about that but you have hired us. Do you have a contract with me? Please be quiet, Miss Fjeldhammer. Do you really have a contract with me? - You did hire us over the phone. How could you be certain it was me? My partner said so. Get me your bandmaster. Easy now! Ok then, you get 5 minutes, going on after the Japanese act at 23:35. You'll get 40 kroner each and I'll hire you for two evenings. You have already hired us. Ok, fine, then I have. But I don't want to hear any complaints about your dressing room. I see. Anything wrong with it? Nothing at all. Better people than you have used of it. Get the bandmaster, please. Ok if I speak? How did it go? Everything's ok. Naturally he tried to pull a fast one. But really, everything's ok. We're on at 23:35, after the Japanese act. We only get 5 minutes but it'll be allright. Why not before the Japanese? Christ, it's a miracle I even managed to get us this. We'll just have to take things as they are. Sure ... when you are like us. He sure put up a fight before he gave in. Where's the hair brush? It's a damn shame we go on after the Japanese. It's the big act, then people want to dance and none will want to watch us. It can't be helped. Maybe if I had arranged it. Let's go for a meal? Just you go. I'll follow later. Come along now. Please. Aren't you getting changed? Two days and the day after tomorrow nothing ... again! Do you have an eyeliner? Oh, it's there. Is it a parquet floor? I already told you. "I aready told you, I aready told you". Enough already, Irene. - Why? Dammit. Dammit, I say! Snuff, stench and filth! What kind of existence is it to travel around, putting on make-up for a bunch of idiots who don't even know if they care to watch the shit we offer them. We think we're dancers, right? What a joke! We cannot dance, we cannot do anything! We are nothing. We have nothing! We'll never get anywhere! What a sewer to get dressed in! Believing, hoping, always toiling... It'll never, never ever come to pass! We are incompetent! We are mismatched! We ought never to have started working together. That's a lie and you know it well. You're just being cruel now. And when will things turn around? I've only known the downside. In the beginning you were happy about us. We were a couple of country bumpkins, happy about anything, above all for ourselves. Yes, so we were! And you just as much as I. You left your troupe and I left the band. We got together and begun training. You trained the hardest. You urged me on. You were the most certain of our..We had a great time back then. We worked hard. Damnit, you worked the hardest.Those were good times. We loved each other.We still do. In reality we still have a good time even if things now are hard. Are you really so sure that we love each other? -Yes! I'm not! I don't love you. You understand? I'm fed up! I'd rather be free of all this, you included! You are about to go on now. Hurry up! Let's go. - Stop touching me! Shut up! Let's go! And now, ladies and gentlemen, an act new to Oslo, the famous Danish/ Scandinavian dancing couple:John and Irene! There's no doubt they liked us. One could hear a pin drop. Did I dance well? So are we compatible then? Do we love each other? How much farther is it to Gothenburg? Another 25 km. So? There's no work to be had. Why not? He hadn't need of more. That's what they always say. He would have hired just me for some stepdancing at 35 kroner per night, but I turned him down. Why? Why turn it down? I won't dance without you. We've arrived, Irene. Let's go, Irene. What time is it? Ten past five. Here you go. Do you need anything else? No, thanks. Sorry to have troubled you. Extension 4209. Yes, this is Johnny Eriksen of the dancing act John & Irene. I'd like to ... Sorry. Are you done calling? Yes,I've been on the phone for 90 minutes. How did it go? - No luck. No luck for two whole months. It seems nobody wants to hire us. You don't know how to speak to those people. -But you do? It's you who want to.But you're stupid. You're no salesman. What is it I cannot do? Hasn't every single job we've had recently been thanks to me? -Yes, thanks. While you're just doing your nails, lying in bed for days on end. I've done everything necessary, whereas you haven't raised a finger. You don't care to do anything. You don't even bother to be the least bit civil towards those we need to associate with. I do whatever suits me. Yes... you certainly do. Yes, I do. And you can't stop me, "dearie". -Irene... "Irene", always "Irene"! I can't stand it! You're not one to inspire confidence. I don't believe in you anymore, you see? I knew it was futile to go to Copenhagen. Boy, did I know! I knew you couldn't get us any work. I lay here knowing you were calling around night after night. And it's always the same everywhere. Stockholm, Gothenburg, Helsingborg... Not a single one of those damn places wants us! We're finished. We never even got started, because you're a fool and everything you touch fails. You're getting worked up. I'm fed up with it all. I loathe our lives and our work. I loathe lounges and restaurants, and hotel guests and dirty dressing rooms. I hate running around from place to place with nowhere to call home. I hate the car, hotels, performing and you! We were to be famous. Europe, America - bullshit!You love me? Bullshit! You were to carry me in your arms through life. Bullshit! You can't even hold me in your arms for 30 secs on the dance floor. Because you're no dancer. I'm unsure what you are. Not a dancer anyway. Maybe a teacher like your father in Fyn. You shut up now! No, I won't! We were to be famous? Hah! We've grown good at begging for an advance, at allowing ourselves to be invited out after a performance, at putting on a smile even though we want to scream at putting up with everything, at hating each other, at wasting our lives! It's murder, plain murder! Stop it! Stop it, Irene! Shut up! All you do is wrong. If you give me advice, I'll do the exact opposite. If you believe in something, I'll stop believing in it. I just cannot stand you. You make my stomach turn. John? Irene. I'm so sorry. Shall we go eat? I love you, John. Forgive me. I love you. Say you love me. I love you. Everything will work out. I mustn't be so cruel. I know you're suffering. I'm sorry about it all. I must look awful now. Shall we go eat then? Yes? Phone call for John & Irene. I'm coming. What the hell can that be? Yes? It's me. John Eriksen. So this is John? Of John and Irene, right? This is Benny Groenning at the Florida Recruiting Agency. We've never met before. Did you apply for the position at the 50/50 Club? Yes, yes. So you are available? Yes! At least for the time being but later we... So you are free at the moment? In that case I have something for you if we can reach an agreement. Have you visited the Honolulu Variety? It's a lovely place. First rate. Quite popular, of course. Just the place for young people. Sounds ok to you? Can you start on Thursday? Thursday? Well, I guess so. A job, a job! You're lying. It's for two weeks, paying 75 kr,starting this Thursday. Is it true? Yes. Really? Yes! Ladies and gentlemen, the last act of the evening: the dancing couple, John & Irene. I'm going home now. I'm throwing a party. You want to come? Thanks so much, I'd love to. Your parties are wonderful. I know what you're up to but what the hell, I can afford it. Any worthy candidates here? Those two. She is nice, right? He'll do. Are they yours? They're somebody I got hold of for you. They've been here three days now. Yes, she'll do. Bring them along. Sure. See you later. Hold it, John. Any plans for tonight? No. I've an invite for you and your partner. You know Carlsen, right? No. Heavens, you don't know Carlsen? There's just one Carlsen. You should seek out his company. He's running the whole entertainment business. Actually, he's your employer. He noticed you this evening, and he asked me to bring you to a party he's giving in Holtet. So what do you say? Well, Mr Groenning, what about the contractual extension? That'll be ok as soon as Carlsen approves it. That's also why I think you should tag along. Are you coming with me? No, we have our own car. Very well. See you there then. So long. Hi, John. Good you came. Where's your partner? Irene felt tired so sadly she couldn't make it. Have you met our host? No. Wager these for me. So it's you. Where's your partner? She was exhausted, Mr Carsten.She gives her regards and says she's sorry. It's going along well. You think so? I wouldn't know. Please stay here. Shall we dance? That's right. You dance with him. He's a great dancer, so he's sure to succeed. Sure. I see. Time to finish this one. You dance wonderfully. Eriksen, there's a call for you. For me? It's from your hotel. You dance wonderfully. When did she become ill? About an hour ago. What's wrong? I don't know. But I was asked to call for you. Anyone else up there now? No. There's nothing wrong, Johnny, nothing at all. Why are you sitting there? They put me to bed but... I'd just returned... When? About an hour ago. As I was waiting to get my key, I suddenly fainted. Out cold. It's silly, isn't it? The blood rushed to my head. How are you then? -What? Who put you to bed? The chambermaid and a doctor they'd called for. Imagine them standing over me, calling for you. -Yes. That really was not necessary. I'm all right now. Did you have a good time at Carsten's? It was good you called. You mean that? It was awful. I hate those kind of gatherings. I was glad to get out of there. But why are you sitting there? Shouldn't you be in bed? Yes, I just missed your company. Now I'm feeling fine. Didn't you say you returned an hour ago? Did you? -Yes But where have you been then? I left you a couple of hours ago. Where did you go? What's the matter with you? John, please don't take this bad. What is it? Then I cannot tell you. Tell me then. I'm pregnant. Today I know for certain. I'm pregnant. Tell me again. I'm pregnant. Again! No more. I've been wondering whether I should tell you or not. Surely one doesn't keep silent about something like this. It's the most glorious news. It's unreal. I can't have that child. What kind of nonsense is that? I'm pleased you want me to give birth to this child. Thank you, John. But I cannot. I've thought it over and I just cannot do it. Say you love me. - I love you. And we are to have a child together. - No. I want an abortion. - No, you don't. Yes. Then I forbid it. I want that child. You won't get it. But we can marry ... today... tomorrow? John, in a month or two I can't perform anymore. Do you realize what that means? Unable to work for six months. No money. Hunger. No roof over our heads. No, my dear John, we two are artists. We cannot allow ourselves to have kids. Others can have as many kids as they please. But not us. But we will have it. It's ours. We'll not travel anywhere. We'll get a place in the country and wait for the child's arrival. And then we'll train it to be the best artist ever and the three of us will be performing. Irene. Where are we to get money? I'll get it. - How? We still owe money on the car. I'll get it. You'll get it? Yes! You can't get any money. And afterwards, then what? Are we to begin all over? Training and going on tour. That costs money, too. Lots of money. No, it's all hopeless. I will get it. That child is us. And we'd never kill ourselves. And when I get the money... But you cannot. And not now that the child is coming. Is that what you'd want to offer your own child? No, my sweet John, it's utter madness. I know how to get that money. I really do. For six months we'll have to stop performing. Wholly impossible, of course. Would you lend me 4000 kroner? Four thousand...Four thousand kroner, John? Are you thinking of staying here in Copenhagen then? Yes, or maybe in the countryside, but that may prove too expensive. No, we'll probably just stay here. I see. Well... But what can you offer me in security? I was thinking of offering you our services until I can fully repay you. We're extremely grateful to be working for you, Mr Groenning. I'm also glad to have you, John. Will you lend us the 4000? As an advance, I mean? Shall we discuss it? You see, our future depends on it. Mr Groenning! We'll see. Let's talk more later, John. - What will Mr Carlsen say? It'll be ok. Groenning takes care of everything. Drop by fourish tomorrow. Yes, thanks. Here? (Yes.) Director Carlsen, as you and Mr Groenning are working together.. I was to speak with Mr Groenning today but he's gone to Aalborg. I was to meet with him at four today but like I said, unfortunately he's gone away. Then I thought you might help me. I was wondering if I possibly could have the money today. It's of vital importance. - Did Groenning really promise you that? What did you promise him in return? - I've offered him... No thanks. Not for my money. But director Carlsen, I suggest... Oh, just shut up! But can't you call him... Ladies and gentlemen, the last performance this evening: the dancing couple, John & Irene. John? I'll be waiting two days, no more. But, Irene.. - Two days, John. Yes. Why are you here? What do you want? Quiet! Don't you see that I'm not stealing, just borrowing. I'll return it all later. Every single oere. Surely you realize that. Let's discuss it. Yes, let's discuss it. Be quiet. I mean you no harm. You're welcome to the money. I don't care. Just get off me. Come in. There's a call for you. Hallo? Irene? It's me. Where are you? Why didn't you come back tonight? I couldn't make it. But listen up... I'm fine No, I'm fine. Has something happened? No, what might that be. Irene, are you alone there? Good. Now listen up. No questions, just listen. Fine. Irene, I've just done a deal, a very good deal indeed. And I have money. Lots of money. I have it here. Everything will be fine. We'll have that child. But John.. - Fine,then you won't hear from me again. Listen up now. All the luggage has been brought to the hotel? That's good. Tomorrow you mustn't do anything. Just relax all day. On Thursday morning you'll drive to Stockholm. Yes, to Stockholm. To our usual hotel. I'll be there. Just be quiet and listen. There's a money order for you in Helsingborg. Drive straight there and bring all the luggage along. Right. Can you manage all that? -Yes. John, there's nothing wrong, is there? -I'm fine, honey. Just fine. But I'm longing for you. Tell me you love me. I do too. Bye. Take good care now. Did you hear that your employer, Director Carlsen, was murdered tonight? We're on our way then. - Do you always travel like this? I pay my taxes. Surely I can travel for free. And surely I can invite a Dane along, too. I like Danes. Why? Because they're just. Justice is supreme. Isn't it? Yes. But it doesn't exist. There is no justice on this Earth. Take me for example. I'm just returning from a big trial. A trial? Where? In Kalmar. What sort of trial? Murder. A famous murder. A baron who murdered his agent. High class people. What was your part? I was the witness. Yesterday afternoon. I got to testify. They paid me 20 kroner in addition to my train fare. That I sold. What did you say in court? I told them the exaxt time when the car exploded. And to have me give that testimony they drove me 167 km. And they paid me 20 kroner plus my fare, which I sold. Yessiree, I sold it. And here I am, travelling, earning 42 kroner and 50 oere. You see, according to MY testimony it was the baron who was the murderer. I testified to that effect. Indeed. He got eight years. - Eight years? That's a long time. - Long? They should have chopped his head off. That'd be just. Eight years is a joke. Mind you, he killed another human being. That's a very serious matter. If one has killed another human one should pay with one's life. That is true justice. In Denmark you still have the death penalty. That's why I like Danes. - It's only for traitors, in wartime and such. War? Life is war. Morning. I'd like to speak with the dancing couple, John & Irene. They've gone. Gone? Yes. Mr John left the evening the day before yesterday.She left early today. Where? - I don't know. But the woman had a call from Stockholm before she left. Stockholm? I see... Irene, I've landed a deal. A very good deal indeed. And I have money. Lots of money. Everything will work out. We can have the child. Going to Stockholm? - Yes. You need to switch in M?lby then. This train goes to Falun. I also happened across a strange case once. I worked there so I heard the whole story. It happened in Denmark. A young guy killed this rich bastard, taking a lot of money. This young guy was an artist. And he performed with his girlfriend. She was pregnant. - So what? But that was what it was all about. He loved her but she wanted to have an abortion. Said it was her child. It'd destroy their career, she said. With them being unable to work, maybe it would die from hunger. She wanted no kid. You know, artists can be strange about their work and career. Then he needed to get money. But what was he to do? Not having that child would have devastated him. Why? - Well, why... He loved her. When you love someone everything changes. It simply would have broken him completely if he couldn't have had that child. It'd have been murder. Murder? Bah! There was no child, just an outgrowth. It's a life. Getting rid of it is premeditated murder. What happened next? He got the money that is, money was promised him. but the man never arrived with the money. So then he had to go get, that is, fetch it himself. He had to do it.But then the millionaire caught him redhanded. And for a brief moment he was overcome with rage. And he accidentally killed the man. He didn't mean to. It was just circumstances. Yeah, right, That's what they all say. What happened next? - Then it all worked out. He didn't tell the girl how he'd gotten the money. They got married, had the child, a lovely kid, and lived happily for several years until the murder case gets solved and he's brought to trial. And then he is found not guilty. -Really? Yes, of course. Not guilty? Yes, of course. It wasn't premeditated at all. He didn't even realize what he was doing. But could that be proven? Proven?No.But it was the truth. And they believed him. There was no proof to the contrary. No murder weapon. He was simply telling the truth. And that was what they wanted to hear. You see, that... that is justice. Moreover, he had taken a life of no consequence, one of those society can do very well without. Instead he'd given life to a small child who'd grow into a good person as well giving the parents joy. As that girl told the court how she'd felt forced to murder that little child before it was born, the jurors realized that the Norwegian primarily had saved a human life. In spite of what he'd done, they exonerated him. That takes the cake. I ... I'd go for the death sentence. After all, a murder is a murder. - No, far from it. It all depends on the motive. You wouldn't call soldiers murderers, would you? No, you wouldn't. Nobody would claim that a soldier at war shouldn't be allowed to kill on that account. Nonsense! Say again? Give me a reason. Bah, just shut up. Nobody asks me that! Idiot! You think the Norwegian should have been set free? No, I don't. Not that it's any of my concern anyhow. You will! You shall! The young man wasn't born a criminal. He was just a normal fellow, a good guy, like you and me. You'd have done the same thing in his place, he just lost his senses. Me? No, never! You contradict me? Yes, I do! But the young guy.. Alright, just shut up! Just shut that damn trap of yours! You really think so? One could almost believe that you're talking about yourself. Say it, scumbag. Am I right? Will you say it? Very well. What is it you want me to say then? Say that I am right. You'll get this if you do. But what am I to say? That I am right! Just say I am right. Of course you are right. The Norwegian deserved to be exonerated. - Of course. Both you and I could have done the same. Of course. Like you and me. It's booze. Good morning.Welcome, Mr John. How are you? I'm fine, thanks. Has Miss Irene arrived yet? No, Miss Irene hasn't come. I see. Well, I didn't think so. But your room is at your disposal. A room? - You did book it yourself. The day before yesterday. That's terrific, thanks. Mr John appears a bit tired. Me? No, I'm just fine, thanks. That's good to hear. Here you go. No luggage? No, Miss Irene has it in the car. I've come from Gothenburg. I understand. Oh, and there's a man who's been asking for Mr John several times. He didn't say his name. A Danish fellow. Just now? No, this morning and yesterday. He said he'd be back. Let's discuss it. Let's discuss it. Let's discuss it. Enter. Well, Miss, I don't want anything after all. Good morning, John. Good to see you again, Irene. How are you? Fine, thanks. And you? You look tired. Are you hurting? Hurting? How come? What's happened? It's been a rough day. And I've been longing for you. What's really happened? Tell me, John. Tell me. Tell what? What is it you want to know? Why did you leave? What are we doing here? What have you been doing these past few days? Business. I already told you. What kind of business? Business like our future engagements here in Stockholm I've also been to Gothenburg. But why leave in the middle of the night? A business opportunity. No time to waste. When did you arrive from Copehagen? Nobody knows our whereabouts? Not a soul. What kind of an opportunity was it, John? You'll know soon enough. Now things will be looking up for us both. Did you bring all your luggage? Are you sad we won't be performing for a long time now? It can't be helped. And the child? Can you feel it? I'm just 2 months along. You'll get the very best care. You'll get everything to your liking. We'll rent a house so as to be far away from it all. We can be ourselves.And we won't have to work for a long time. I have money.Lots of money. John, answer me now. I've done all you told me and here I am. Tell me everything now. Where did you get that money? The money? Oh, I quite forgot to tell you. I got it in Gothenburg. - From who? From an old friend I was told lived there. What's his name? Andersson. That is to say.. He's a Danish-American. We knew each other as boys, then as schoolkids. How much did he lend you? 5000 kroner; three thousand of it in Swedish money. Wasn't he kind? And when must you repay him? - Whenever I can. He's filthy rich but very nice. It's damn rare. How did you get to Gothenburg? Groenning gave me 25 Swedish kroner. Why didn't you tell me so that night? I simply couldn't. I had to walk all the way to Helsingor to reach the ferry. Otherwise I couldn't be sure that.... Andersson... before he went back to the States. Why can nobody know we're here. Why the secrecy? Listen, Irene, I don't like being interrogated. I'm working hard to secure our future. - You're lying! What are you saying? You're lying, John. I can tell by looking at you. Indeed I can. Why are you lying to me? I'm not lying. Yes, you are. Tell the truth now. I've told you. No. God have mercy on you, John. What's wrong with you? You've never lied to me before. I gave you two days and they're up. And you treat me like this? What do you think it'll lead to? Why won't you tell the truth? There's nothing more to tell. I agreed to have your child because I love you. And I act accordingly, accepting all future uncertainty. And this is what you offer me! Offering you what? A damn lie! Like a ten-year-old schoolboy! How the fuck are you talking to me? I speak like I want 'cos I speak truth. Yeah, that's fine. Strike me? You just go ahead and do it. Why don't you hit me? Enter. Thanks, that'll be fine. Just put it there. You must take care not to infuriate me, Irene. My nerves are all shot. I'm not myself. Forgive me. I'd love to forgive you, John. But you need to tell me all. Where did you get that money? I just have it. Isn't that enough? But in what manner did you get it? Do you think I've done anything wrong? No, but just tell why you had to leave so abruptly and why all the secrecy? Well, you see, I heard of Andersson through a mutual acquaintance who also intended to borrow some money from him. And that's what made me hurry to Gothenburg. Is that true? Yes, it is. Completely true? Yes. Can you look into my eyes and tell that's the truth? Heavens, what have we come to. Yes, it is true. Fine. Then I believe you. Where are we going from here? Somewhere in Dalarne maybe. Somewhere far away. I could do with some new clothes if possible. You'll get it all. Really? A hat? Shoes? Stockings? Yes, whatever you want! Can it be expensive stuff? As expensive as you like! There's a gentleman downstairs wishes to speak to Mr Eriksen. I'll be there in a minute Who is it? I don't know but I have to go see him. John, did you know that that Carlsen you visited was murdered that morning you went away? - Yes, so I've heard. Apparently they haven't located the murderer..yet. No.. not yet. Good day, John. Good day. Good to see you. Shall we go in here for a while? Yes, we might as well. How did you know I was here? One just knows. We so wanted to have you and Irene stay on longer with us. Instead of that damn juggling act. But then you'd vanished. Yes, I suddenly fell ill. I went to see a specialist who knows me. A stomach ulcer. A stomach ulcer? I see. Feeling better now? Yes, thanks. Do you recall wanting to borrow 4000 kroner from me? Yes. I got it somewhere else. -I see. We're not working until Irene has had the baby as I told you. You want to hire us for a longer timeframe now? Is that what you want from me? -Among other things. But then there's the small matter of the 4000 kroner. And as we're in Sweden, in Swedish money. To keep my mouth shut. John Eriksen, 4000 is cheap. You get off cheap. Get off? For what? For murder. Though there's no proof, and though the police have no clue. I'll leave for America. I'll stay there for a year.. And if I cannot pay? So the worse for you. I wasn't quite sure. So you did murder Carlsen. Sure you can pay me. And 4000 Swedish kroner is cheap for murder. Very cheap, John. And I need that money! Alright. You'll get it. When? The plane leaves tomorrow afternoon. Come to Storehof at 10 o'clock. I'll be on time. A stomach ulcer, was it? Mr John? I was to tell you that Miss Irene has gone for a walk. For a walk? Yes. Has she returned? - No, there's been no sign of Miss Irene. Here's Miss Irene. - Irene? Irene! What's happened? The baby? You haven't had it removed? - Yes. Why, Irene? Everything's become hopeless. You refused to tell the truth. That's why. Lie down. I'll get a doctor. Can you call for a doctor? A doctor? Sure. Are you in much pain? Not right now. Why didn't you tell the truth? Do you know about it? Ever since you called me that night. And John... I didn't dare tell it. I was so afraid of losing you. I was in such despair this afternoon that I'd rather die. No, Irene, no. And what about me? Is it because you don't love me now? No, not at all. I understand very well how it happened. But what we've done is terrible. Terrible. Yes, how did it happen? None of us are evil. We aren't criminals. We don't want to be. We love each other. Yes, we love each other. It's my fault! It's my fault! No, it's not your fault. And nor was it mine. It... You were too weak in facing me. And I was far too hard on you. People shouldn't treat each other like that.
