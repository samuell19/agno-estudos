(MultiCom Jingle) (dramatic music) (engine purring) (tires squealing) (tires squealing) (tires squealing) - This one. Wrong door. Cynthia. Cut, stop. Cynthia, I told you... - Why'd you do this to me? - I told you the right... - [Cynthia] How could you do this to me? - Cyhthie, I told you that's the door. - It's enough. I can't take this anymore. - Yeah, did we get the mark? Did you even get the first part? - At first, I fly business instead of first, then you put up in a rat hole, and then this. - [Jake] Cynthia, baby. - I almost fell out of the car. Of course, I'm a professional, so I kept going, but to fall through a goddamn door, straight into the arms of a perv. - Peter's trying to catch you. He's not a perv. - He grabbed my ass. So, you can all kiss it now. I'm done. - Cynthia. Baby, please! Please do not do this to me. The movie. - This, this is never ever gonna be a movie. - Cynthia, please. (dramatic music) (speaking in foreign language) - [Mark] Speak English. We all agreed that speaking English will attract more international clients. Come on, say it in English. - [Richie] Dude, our crib is in the crapper. - [Mark] Very funny, dude. - [Reporter] And in other news, Jake Griffin is shooting his new movie in a studio outside Budapest, Hungary. The teen idol is directing and producing. It is rumored that Cynthia Star has pulled out of the production and has already left the country. Apparently, the two have also ended their romance. - [Man] What a mess. (phone ringing) - [Man] English. - Betty speaking. How may I help you? Oh. Some Russian guy. - Hello? I don't know what to tell you. (laughing) - Buddy. Buddy. - [Buddy] Yeah? - [Man] For us, nothing is impossible. Done. - [Buddy] Hi guys. - Nice of you to show up. - Hello, took the Volks for a spin. - Checkmate. - Time to face the facts. If you don't get a big job soon, we are done. - Yes, and we can shut this company down. How about something creative instead of just giving up? - We are not just another dating agency. We are legendary. (laughing) - All right, you legend. Pay the bills. - Hey, hey hey, guys. Guys, wait. Wait. Listen, I have the solution to save the company. We start an online dating site. I planned everything. - What is he talking about? - I have no idea. - Hey, I've been up all night, and already started a marketing campaign. I sent e-mails to potential clients in Russia. Whoa whoa, wait. And China. - Buddy, Buddy, you are a true genius. - Really? - You, you are a true genius. - That's us. - Our boss would like a word with you. - Where we goin'? - Hey Buddy, those e-mails, who exactly did you send them to? (dramatic music) - First we tried to contact you over the phone. But I thought then... It would be better if we met in person right away. Hmm? Good health, gentlemen. - Yeah, this is a misunderstanding. You were not supposed to get this e-mail. It's... (speaking foreign language) Mistake. - Yes, it was. I'm terribly sorry, but we are extremely busy at the moment, so we can't take any new assignments. - Oh, I'm so pleased to hear that, because I thought that your agency suffering heavily from the recession, and I understand they're close to bankruptcy. Let's get down to business. So, I want you to get this guy in love with this young lady. He's an American actor, his name is Jake Griffin. - Jake Griffin? That's not gonna happen, man. - I thought nothing was impossible for you people at SOS Love. - That's exactly why we don't accept everything. - Yeah. - Just so that you understand, my sister is a nice girl, but ever since our parents died she became a different person. She stopped everything she once loved doing, she sits at home, no friends, no dates, but she's absolutely crazy about this guy. So, I thought maybe he can snap her out of it. Okay, if you succeed, I'll pay you one million dollars in cash. - Let's make it two. (laughing) - No, we'll make it one, under the circumstances, and I believe my offer cannot be refused. - Sorry, is that 3D? Can I... - Yeah, of course. - Thank you. - I believe we have a deal. These are your tickets, you're flying to Los Angeles tomorrow morning. - Tomorrow? - Cool! I've never been to L.A. before, even though my aunt lives there. - I apologize. - Never mind. You have one week to get everything ready before I send my sister over. Here's some information about her. You have to use some kind of cover story, because she cannot have any idea about our business. That is understood? - [Richie] Mmm-hmm. - Okay. This is 100,000 dollars in small bills. Hey. Leave the money in the backpack. The titanium net will stop it from showing up on the scans. You do understanding that if something goes wrong, or you fail... (dramatic music) - Ooh, ooh sorry. I gotta go. - Hey, hey, where you goin'? - Where do you think? - Buddy, don't get lost. - Relax, I'm a big boy. - Hey Buddy. - What? - We'll wait here. - Thank you. - Okay, I got a plan. - Always wash before. - Why you guys were sleeping I read info about Zoya and Jake. They have something in common. They're both into saving the environment. You know, let's save the whales and the rain forest. - Rain forest? Really? - That's exactly what we can use. We just have to find the right cause. (dramatic music) - Sorry, sorry, sorry. - We do it Hollywood style. Set up a foundation, rent a few rooms in an expensive hotel, then we organize a private party where we invite our star and the girl. Smooth music, caviar, champaign, then we collect donations and get the kids to fall for each other while supporting a noble cause. - That's a great plan. - I feel much better. Everything is all right. - [Child's Voice] If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands. If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands. If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands. If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands. If you're happy and you know it, and you really wanna show it, if you're happy and you know it clap your hands. - Luckily, we live in the age of ATMs, so get them credit cards out and let's do this. - [Man In Pink Shirt] Don't have to do nothing. I only have some change. - Oh. Well, there goes the five-star hotel, and the fancy rain forest party. So, what's plan B? (upbeat music) Is this really where this grandma lives? (horn beeping) - Like my brother. Who are you, my sweetie? - Me? Your brother's son, Buddy. Don't you remember? - Buddy. - [Buddy] Yeah. - Oh. Come on, come in, come in. Come in. So, the kitchen is to the left, guest room over there to the right. My grandma used to say that unexpected guests are a fate worse than rape. Although, I'm sure she wasn't speaking about lovely boys like you. Okay, my dears, why don't you make yourselves at home and sleep off your jet lag, and then I'll meet you tomorrow morning at breakfast. Of course, there's no hurry, because I have a hot date. I'm going dancing. Okay. (purring) (laughs) All right, toodle loo, have fun. - Good morning. - Oh, good morning, my darling. So glad you survived the night. Glad to see you're still breathing. I was afraid you'd suffocate. Your AC was off and I tried to come in to fix it, but somehow the door got stuck. No worries, I'll have my boyfriend look into it. He's great with his hands, if you know what I mean. Oh, let's not stand here chatting. You must be starving. Come, eat. - [Richie] Thank you. - I'm gonna go to the office. I've left you an address on the refrigerator, and I'm gonna even draw you a little map so you can find it. Beverly Hills. Come have lunch with me. - Even if we all can't make it, I'll make sure that Mark's gonna be there. (laughing) - That'd be great. Bye. - [Richie] Bye. - [Mark] Bye. - [Mimi] Have a great day. - What's wrong, darling? Come on, she's a serious cougar, man. - Buddy. Tell me. Where did you get this sex obsessed chick from? - She's my dad's younger sister. She came to America when she was about 17. She ended up marrying some old rich guy, and left her this house and the business. - What kind of business would that be? I mean, by the way she looks and dresses and acts, she probably runs an escort service, right? - I recall my Mom saying that Mimi always perform best on her back. - Okay, we still have a chance. Just have to change plans. Since we can't do the party, we have to get Jake some other way. I would say we start with his agent. His address is here. - I'll get Jake's personal address. - How? - I know a stunt guy who worked on his movie in Hungary. - Okay, we'll take a look at both places today. - Hey guys, guys. Wait. I need to change. - Just keep our place warm by the pool. - Yeah, but don't piss in it, dumb shit. - [Buddy] Hey guys. Guys! (upbeat music) - This is the one. Thank you. - Hey, how you doin'? Let's go. - Hey, where do you think you're going? - To the agent's office. Why did you make me walk a damn marathon to take a picture of the building, huh? - You can't get through without an appointment. Jesus. We are here to observe first. - Observe? Observe what? How are we supposed to know what our guy looks like? - Okay, let's go. (dramatic music) (phone ringing) - Yeah, I'm in position. - You're a go. - Ready to rock and roll. Gotcha. (dramatic music) (phone ringing) - Mark speaking. - [Mimi's Assistant] Hi Mark, this is Mimi's assistant. I'm calling to see if you were planning on coming to lunch today. Mimi has this super romantic spot picked out, that is, if it's going to be just the two of you. Does that sound all right? - All right. Talk to you later. (dramatic music) - Wow. Can't believe this guy actually took the pizza. What a cheap ass. - Welcome to Hollywood, bro. - [Richie] Got the address. - We need to get a car. Something low key. - All right, I got this. (grunting) (engine starting) - What the hell is this? - It's a classic. '81 Cadillac. It's beautiful, huh? - Yeah, you're crazy. - These Americans really know how to live. Come on, get in. - Tell me there is no body in it. - Star map celebrities anywhere in Hollywood. I have the best, only me. I've been here for years. - Oh really? - Yeah. - Oh yes. - Hungary, 10 dollars. - Sorry, and where is Jake Griffin's house? - Oh, Jake, Jake. I got Jake Griffin, man. He has a couple homes. The biggest home he has is right here. Look at this. Jake Griffin section, he has his own section, okay. It's 45567. - Yeah. - Appian way. Appian way. - Yes. - We have Jake Griffin, Madonna, Justin Bieber. We have Lady Gaga. - You are my man. - Yay! - Thanks. - So 10 dollars, buddy. - Bye, bye. - Okay, yeah, that's great. Hey! 10 doll... I gave you information, you pay me! This is America! Second time in an hour. - This is where he lives? - Yeah, I guess so. Remember the stunt guy I told you about? He was here about a year ago to talk about Jake Griffin's new movie, so yeah, this is it. - [Mark] Buddy? How did he get here? - [Richie] No way. - Why is he dressed like that? - What the hell is he doing? (alarm wailing) - [Mark] Oh shit, oh shit. - [Richie] Oh no. - [Mark] Stop! (dramatic music) Hey. Hey, up. Let's go. - Guys. I almost peed in my pants. I thought it was Russian goons. - No, I see lots of tension in your love life. A little bit of fun, and tenderness could make for some magic. - I'll handle the love life. What about everything else? - It also says you're going to do some unexpected things for some people who may need your help. Friends, actually, who may need your help. - Really? What, for business or for pleasure? - I don't know. Most likely it's business, but I really think you should work on that love life. - Really? Think so? - [Man] Mm-Hmm. - Are you sure? - Probably. - But you're my only true friend, so I'm not gonna chance it. - Chance what? I mean... I just thought you had something in there. - Oh, is that right? - Yeah, just fixing that... - Mm-hmm, Mm-kay. - For ya. - [Man] Hey Buddy, wake up. Come on. - Easy. There you go. Could you help us back up, please? - Trust me. (engine starting) Back it up. - [Richie] Yeah, we trust you Buddy. - [Mark] To enjoy your lunch with Aunt Mimi. - Hey, hey! This is so not fair. (dramatic music) - [Man With Hat] Are you all right? - Yeah, yeah. Thank you, sir. - Okay. - Thank you, thank you. Sorry, sorry. (dramatic music) Excuse me. Can you tell me where I can find Mimi's agency? - [Receptionist] Excuse me? - Mimi's agency. - [Receptionist] Oh, top floor. - Yes, thank you. Bye. - [Receptionist] Bye. - [Buddy] Oh. - What are you doing? - Hey, remember when I hooked up with my parole officer's daughter? Hot girl. She has this show with a snake. She just e-mailed me some pictures. Look at this. - Which one is the snake? - Impressive, huh? - Can you get off the net and focus? (dramatic music) (engine starting) (dramatic music) - Have you heard anything from the studio? - You abandoned us, sinking ship, you know, and they didn't really appreciate it. So, they don't really wanna work with ya anymore. - Hi. - Hi, thank you. - Some friends are coming to join us, so let's start with water. - Yeah, I'll have the um... - Two waters. - We got a couple more scenes to shoot, man, and the film's finished. - Yeah, I know, which is why... I mean, if you had a couple scenes, why didn't you shoot the couple scenes instead of going looking for Cynthia? Now you got no woman and you got no films. So, what? I mean, really? - I guess they're talking about the millions of dollars they're gonna cash in for Jake's next movie. - Okay, it's time now. Hey, how are you? - Hey. - Finally. I'm sorry. I'm the president of the European SOS Foundation. - European SOS Foundation, yes. - We are looking for a sponsor for an important project. - Sponsorship? You're looking for sponsorship. Okay, why don't you give a call to my secretary, and... - Hey guys, how you doin'? Everything all right? Sorry to interrupt. - Are you with that SOS Foundation? I need an SOS Foundation. Help me, would you? - [Waiter] Sir, come this way. - Get him away from the table. That would be... - Quentin just called. He wants us back on the set right now. Nice seeing you. That's a nice suit. - So, I mean, what am I supposed to do? Go sweetheart in a couple of films, raise the money myself to finish it? - It's not that simple. There haven't been many offers coming in for ya of late, so we gotta basically start over. Rebuild from a foundation again. - What do you mean there's no offers? I mean, they're re-airing the series again. It's number four on cable. - I know. As popular as you are with teenage girls and with the housewives, the studios are... You're on a kind of a shit list, you know. So, it makes my job a little harder, but it's, you know, I'm still dedicated to try to get that traction back, and that's doable through a lot of TV, you got a lot of reality, you got a lot of... - Soaps. - Soaps. - I'm not doing soaps again. I grew out of 'em. Not happenin'. - Come on, you were, you know, you were a hit. It, you know, nothin' wrong with that. Nothing wrong with that at all. Hell, I was at a birthday party, and I saw... It was you, I saw you. You were a gift. - Sorry, wait. What do you mean, what do you mean you saw me? Where? - I was at a party from a friend of mine. He's got a teenage daughter, big fan of yours. He bought you, a lookalike, and he paid him 10,000 dollars to work the party. - So he made 10,000 dollars to play me for one night? - He was good. He was really good, actually. His name was Green. I have it on my phone somewhere, he was... Anyway, why was he paid? Because he showed up on time, and he didn't leave, until the party was over. Jake, listen. - Look, Ed. - [Jake's Agent] Don't worry. - Hurry. You know I put all my money into this film. - [Jake's Agent] I'll make a couple calls, all right. Don't worry. - Woo hoo hoo hoo! Yes! Hey guys. I can't believe it. I'm in Venice Beach. This is where DiCaprio fenced. - We are running out of time, and still don't know how to to hook Zoya up with Jake. - Or how to explain we're missing 100,000 dollars. And you know what? This is not where DiCaprio fenced. - He didn't fence at all. - This isn't even Venice Beach. (phone ringing) - Betty. - Uh oh. - Hi babe. You going to sleep now? - I found some interesting information about the Russian. - I can't talk about this right now. We are not doing so well, and still have to figure out what to do, so... Anyhow, you should be very careful. - Thanks for listening. - I'm a dead man. Take revenge for Romeo. - Jake Griffin look alike, John Green, performs stunts and bartends at parties. (dog barking) Going to school for English literature and theater. Nice. - So what have my lost boys been up to? I haven't even seen you since you've arrived. What is it that you do exactly? - I just wanted to ask you exactly the same question, Aunt Mimi. How come you have this beautiful office here? - 40 years ago, this was Hollywood's biggest talent agency, thanks to my dear husband Ira. May he rest in peace. You can see what a sentimental fool I am. This was his last cigar, and it will be there 'til the day I die. No one is allowed to touch it. - Oh Mimi. Who are your clients now? - Celebrities, lookalikes. - Oh, so you run an agency for star lookalikes? - Mm-hmm. Ira wasn't a pinup, but he did have a brain for business. - Who the hell would actually pay money for fake celebrities? - In this country, everybody who's got money. Bar Mitzvahs, birthday parties, corporate events, Vegas shows, you name it. - [Mark] Do you have a Jake Griffin lookalike? - We're got four of them, and even that's not enough, he's so popular. We've got ongoing castings, but I'm sorry, I've got to go. See you guys shortly, okay. (laughing) - How many times have I told you to have lunch with me? We'd be flooded with Jake Griffins by now. - Okay, this is what we are gonna do. We ask Aunt Mimi to set up an audition, and select the Jake Griffin lookalike. Meanwhile, we have to put together all that we can find out about him. - Then we teach our substitute lover boy to be a convincing Jake Griffin. Get him together with a chick, finish the job, collect the cash, and walk away without a scratch. Questions? - Yeah. Dude. - Hmm? Oh. - Okay, but, what happens to the happy couple after? I mean, there's a good chance that fake Jake here is going to, you know, disappear once we've paid him off, and then we're gonna be in deeper shit than ever. - Come on, we didn't sign up for having them married. - [Buddy] Hey, hey, hey. Because of the transiting of the planets, strange energies are entering the ether. Careful, my darlings, lest you get into trouble. I'm just kidding. No, I do do my horoscope every week, and it usually is right. - Oh Mimi. We need your services. - I'm all yours, my darling. - I mean, your agency services. - Really? So... (dramatic music) (camera shutter clicking) - Next. - This one is just a joke. - Yeah, he's not Jake Griffin. - So, you're still in college, and work at nights. What do you do, what's your major? - English lit and theater history, but I make my living bartending... - Boring. You won't be needing any of those. Let's get to the point, college boy. - Okay, what's your name? - Jake Griffin. (laughing) - That's a good one. But your application says... What's his name, Buddy? - John Green. - John Green. All right, please wait outside while we make our decision. Thank you. - Thanks for coming. - [Buddy] Thank you. - Yeah, bye. - Thank you. - This one. - [Mark] Mm-hmm. - This one. - I think John Green was the best. - Come on, that guy is such a tool. You seen the real Jake in the restaurant, right? Remember, Mr. Genius. This guy isn't that either. Look. - I say we go for this one. John Green. I know he isn't perfect, but we can make him work. - What now? - Go get him. - Okay. - He's gonna be hard to train. But I got this. - [Buddy] Sit down. - Thank you so much for the job. I mean, wow. To play Jake Griffin, I've always wanted to be Jake Griffin. So, what is the job exactly? Where are you guys from? - From Hungary. The number one match making agency in Budapest. Job's the usual. You will be escorting a female Griffin fan. Along the way, we will create a romantic love story, extra money, of course. - [Richie] Obviously the girl cannot find out that you're a lookalike. Is that understood? - I'm just not sure how we'll make this happen in one of the most exposed cities of the world. In Hungary, we could arrange anything. - Very true. - Could you arrange a film shoot? - Probably. Why? - Well, you know, Jake Griffin in Los Angeles, the paparazzi's gonna be following him, and, you know, you're never gonna really create that connection. But, let's say Hungary, for instance. We do a film shoot. I heard jake was shooting a movie out there and it got put on hold for whatever reason. He still has a couple scenes left to shoot. - You are saying Jake has to go back to Hungary to finish a movie... - That's a great idea. You guys are geniuses. - Excellent. - Ed, I need you to go to the studio and ask them if they would distribute the film if I could finish it in the next couple of weeks. No, no, I didn't get the money, but I found another way. - Gonna rebuild a submarine here. Watch this. (laughing) - Cool whip. - You little imps. Did you really think that I wouldn't notice something funny was going on? Hmm? You know, it took my poor husband, Ira, 20 years to build up this company. I sure hope you wouldn't manage to destroy it in just a day. All right, my sweeties. Now... You tell me everything. - Hello. - [John] Hey, it's John Green. - Yeah, hey buddy, come on in. - [John] Hello. Mr. Griffin. - [Jake] What's up, man? - Hi. See ya, oh, not lookin'. This is a beautiful house. - Yeah. You brought your passport, right? - Yeah, oh, I did, I brought it. Yeah, it's right here. I'll put it on the table. So where are you going? - Just gonna be traveling around Europe a little bit with the freedom of not being Jake Griffin. You know, little getaway. - Am I gonna be able to get in touch with you? - I'll leave you my phone number so you can call me if anything happens. - Mm-hmm. Well, I hope you have a good time. - [Flight Attendant] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Budapest Ferihegy International Airport. (dramatic music) - Jake Griffin. - Please, please. Please, please, please. Sorry. - Just an autograph, please. - Jake Griffin. - Thank you. Am I dreaming? I have his autograph. I love you. - Looks like our plan is working. (laughs) - Yeah, we'll see. We need a good action movie, right? - Yep, here we go, stop. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, the one and only Jake Griffin. Rewind. - [Man] Wow. - Stop, play it. - Play. Okay. - [Man] Last dance, punks. - [Woman] I need, save me Marshal. - [Man] It's justice that won again. I guess it takes two to tango. - And freeze. Got that? - [Jake] Mm-hmm. - Okay, show us. Come on. - No, I'm good. I mean it's really hard. I don't think I can do that. You should show me. - Okay. - Okay. - You ready? - [Jake] Yeah. - Watch. Okay. Last dance, punks. Boom, boom! And justice wins again. I guess it takes two to tango. (laughing) - That's good. - All right? - Yeah. - Your turn, come on. - No. I can't. It's just not my thing. - Come on, let's start with the basics now. Okay, the key to true acting is don't act. First of all, you gotta loosen up. Do this. Okay, good. Good. Now, relax, let everything else go. Okay. Method acting. Like all the great masters, Stanislavski, Strasberg, Richard Dean Anderson. Method acting, okay. Feel it in your heart, the pain in your bones, in your flesh, as John Green dies, and Jake Griffin is born. - Wow. - Who are you? - I'm Jake Griffin. - Say it. - I am Jake Griffin. - No, say it. - No, really, I am Jake Griffin. - Who are you? - You're not listening, I am Jake Griffin. - Say it again, who are you, who are you? Who are you? Say it! - [Jake] You're not listening. - [Richie] Say it, come on, say it! Who are you? - Listen! I'm Jake Griffin, all right? - That was perfect. Come on, do it again. Come on, come on, do it. - I've done this signature a million times. - That's the point. When you're signing an autograph, it should appear as if you've done it a million times. Just, you know, don't even look at it. Naturally. Do it. - Stop laughing. We only have a few days left to turn you into a movie star. - Oh, wait, wait, wait. Looks like our Jake is left handed. - No, no no no no. I know for a fact, no, I know for a fact that Jake is not left handed. He's right handed. - It's left handed. - This picture is mirrored, it's flipped. I'm telling you, these... - Listen, man, you haven't exactly impressed us so far. If you don't get your act together you can go back to working at a bar. - Here's the budget. Address. - What? There's no way we are going to spend this much. - How do you calculate? - Okay, I have the perfect solution. There will be no film shoot at all. - [Woman] Great, and? - The cover story is still that Jake is filming in Hungary, but we won't take the girl to set. Instead... - Instead? - Instead, we'll bring Jake to the girl. - [Woman] Good idea. (chuckles) - Look, man, I know. Plotted, pretend to be shooting a movie in front of a camera, but this is part of our duty too. So just stick to the game plan. Hi guys. - [Woman] Pasta. - So, anyway, this is the restaurant. - So you got the restaurant, the dining room tables, that's good. You don't even have a kitchen. - Yet. - [Woman] Come here. - Come here. - [Man] This needs to be work again. - So, we're supposed to get this billionaire's daughter to fall in love with me here? I don't know, man. I just don't think she's gonna believe any of this. - The fact that the love of her life, Mr. Irresistible Jake Griffin, dines here every day when he comes to the set, will make her believe. - [Man] Are you listening? All right, lads. - Anyway, I heard the food is really good here. (dramatic music) - What's that under her arm? - Lenin, her cat. Let's go get her. - Come on. - Sorry. - So, my brother says that you're in a film company, and that I will work for you. He says that I'll meet a bunch of movie stars and have fun. - That's right, we do have a film company, and right now we are shooting an American movie. For starters, you will work at our restaurant just outside the studio as a waitress. - A waitress? Have you lost your mind? I could buy your shitty little restaurant and be the owner. - I'm sorry, but it's not for sale. - Of course, we need to see first if you can handle the job. We need someone who wouldn't drop a plate when seeing the likes of Tom Cruise or Jake Griffin. (gasping) - What did you say? Who's coming to the restaurant? - I was joking. Obviously we don't have Tom Cruise shooting here. You will have to settle for this teenage star. Jake... Come on, what's his name? I just said it. - Griffin. - Yes. - Jake Griffin. - No, no, no, no, no no. That way. - There's no way Lenin and I are sitting in that dump. - I'm afraid you will have to. Jake wants to stay out of the public eye. We can't lose cover. Understand? - But my bags. - You won't need those. - All right, and while you're working for us, this is going to be your place to stay. It's not a Zara Hotel, but it's close to the restaurant. Furniture is rustic. (crying) - Zoya, listen. We will not force you to do anything. You can just tell your brother that you changed your mind. (phone ringing) That's him. Looks like the boys have spilled the beans already. So... What's it gonna be? - [Maxim] Zoya. - I'll call you later. - Okay, you will have to drop this. So go to the bathroom, wash your face, and surprise us. (cat meowing) (cat meowing) (gentle music) I'll go look for Zoya. - Jake. - [Jake] Hey Ed. - Can you hear me? Jake, where have you been? I've been leaving you like a thousand messages. - Yeah, I'm back in Hungary. Staying at a beautiful hotel. - You're in Hungary? Stay in Hungary, okay. Listen to me, I got a deal... - [Jake] So, what's the news? - I got a deal for you. All you gotta do, is you gotta finish the job in two weeks, and then they are back in business with you. (phone beeping) Hello. Hungary? Come in, Hungary. Are you... - [Waiter] Do you care to see our daily specials? - Not that hungry. - All right, and as of tomorrow you're gonna leave that naked monster of yours at home, okay? You won't be bored without it. I guarantee that. - I have no idea why Maxim sent me here. But, you know what I think? You're a boring, tasteless, arrogant, giant freak. And ugly, too. (laughs) (cat purring) - Okay, you wanna know what I think? You're a spoiled, whiny, annoying little child. That's what you are. - That's it. I'm getting out. - Oh, please, let me help you. Please, come on, please. - What the hell are we doing here anyway? - Filling up. - Here? - Yeah, this is an electric car, and that is an electric charging station. Anymore stupid questions, Miss oh I'm so green? (sobbing) Okay, listen honey. Gum. Blow your nose. Stop crying. Let's start over, okay. I'll give you some friendly advice. - Hey, hi guys. So, Zoya meet restaurant, restaurant meet Zoya. Zoya, Gézuka, Gézuka, Zoya, and Lenin. So, this is our new waitress. - We are open usually from noon to 8:00 p.m., unless they work late at the studio. Remember, the kitchen is off limits. You put your order in by the window, and that's also where you pick it up. - You have to watch him. He eats new waitresses for breakfast. Okay, good luck. I need Lenin. Now. (cat meowing) - [Gézuka] Hold these. - Smile. - Whoa. (whistling) - Two beef chili is about... 2,100. (yelling) Change. Thank you. - [Customer] Thank you very much. - Yay! - Thank you. Take them home. - Oops. - Copy that. Can you see me? - Yeah. - You ready? Show time. (dramatic music) - Where's the girl? - [Man] That one. - [Customer] Hey! (plates clanking) What are you doing? - [Zoya] Sorry, sorry. - [Customer] What are you doing? - That's her. - Hey, I heard the shoot today was fantastic. Don't blow it, man. Look, we both know you are not an actor, but if you do everything like I told you, it will all work out just fine. - [Gézuka] Move it, sweetie. (humming) Zoya, wakey, wakey. (cat meowing) - Could I have a menu, please? Plates, knife, fork. Spoon. Water. I thought this was a restaurant. - [Man] Stop messing with her. - I think she's gonna cry. - [Gézuka] One's enough. - No one's gonna believe this one. - Shakespeare's entire collection. I'll read it and have it memorized by Monday. O Romeo, Romeo. Wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name. - Or, if thou wilt not, be sworn my love, I will no longer be a Capulet. - Oh, so cute. I think I'm gonna throw up. - That was cool. Sounds good. It's delicious, I'm gonna have that. I'm gonna start with it at least. - [Gézuka] Easy, Zoya, Easy. - [Jake] Uh oh. - [Man] How many? - What the hell? Buddy, where exactly did you put the closed sign? - Ah... Here. - [Man] Leave now. - Hey, I gotta go, so not to say this hasn't been an extremely interesting lunch. I gotta get to rehearsal. Would you like to come to my movie set? - What set, you moron? - The day after tomorrow at nine would be perfect. Yeah? Great, I'll see you there. Everyone enjoy your food. The lunch is really, really good. (cat meowing) - Shut up! (phone ringing) - Yeah? Uh-huh. Great. I love fast results. - Well, I told you we always deliver. - But I hope you won't screw up again as you did in L.A., huh. Yeah, you won't cancel at the last minute. - We can't back out. Zoya already told her brother about Jake Griffin personally inviting her to the shoot. - Okay, we just received the answer to our e-mail. They say they didn't even touch the set of the Griffin flick, and the technical equipment is standby. It looks like the Hungarian film district isn't exactly booming these days. - One less problem. Now we only have to get the crew together. - Only? And where on Earth are we gonna find that many people in a day? - I mean, the solution seems pretty simple. Hire Griffin's crew. I mean, they're available, right? So, they can do the movie. Plus, they have the extra advantage of already knowing how to work on the movie, right? - Yes. Oh, really, Mister know it all, if this gets out, that's it for us. And even if the crew's available, who's gonna pay for that? - Yeah, who's gonna pay for that? - Yeah, who? - Well, in L.A., these guys told me that they could put anything together. Even a film shoot. So what's the problem? - Hey Jake. - [Jake] Hey. - Good to see you again. - [Jake] Good to see you. - Hi. - It doesn't look too good. Is this what we're paying a ton of money for? - Don't worry. It looks just fine on the big screen. - We'll see. Okay. You all know Jake Griffin, and, as you heard by now, we are his new co producers. Oh, so let me remind you about our confidential agreement you signed. Okay. (garbled speaking) Let's get to work. - New co producer doesn't seem to be on top of things much. - Yeah, but he's picking up the tab, right? - Oh. - Don't worry about him. Yeah, no, I'm fine. Look, we're just gonna take this from where I pull up the car, and I'm sittin' in there with a gun waiting for the guys... - Would you excuse us for a second? What the hell are you doing? I told you to leave the talking to me. - Camera guy gave me the script. I told him I left it at the hotel room last night, so he gave me his. But this has all the characters and story and scenes and stuff, and I read it, and now I know what scenes we have to shoot to finish the film. - Yeah? Wonderful, why do you care about this? Hmm? - Well, you know, we gotta make it look real. So, for example, like right here, there's this guy, this Russian guy who has to fight me. We don't have an actor to play him. We need an actor. - Why didn't you want a whole battle scene? Okay, let me tell you something. This isn't a real shoot. Everything and everyone is pretending, huh. - Okay, that's good. But this is Jake's film crew, and unlike you, they read the script. - He's right. I mean, we don't know what Zoya read about this film in the papers, right? - Why waste money? He'd make a perfect bay guy, huh. - Yeah. Finally get a chance to wipe that stupid smile off your pretty little face. - Richie. - Boom. - [Woman] Richie. Go on. Go. - Is that clear? Good. - [Man] Okay, Zoya, just sent her in. We are on. - Copy that, we are sending, John. - Where is Jake Griffin? - He's over there. - Jake! - Hey, welcome. Hang on a second. - Jake! I love you. Please. - [Man On Radio] Left hand. - You have to leave. - Hey. (dramatic music) - Come on, I'll show you where you can watch. Right here. - Well, well well. The waitress. - Delete the picture from the chick's phone. - Shut up. Sorry about that. - [Man On Radio] Get over here now. - Good to see you. - Did you forget you're left handed? Okay, here's how it's gonna go down. You're gonna show off for a few hours, impress the chick, then we close shop and get out of here. But, you will get sick, unfortunately. And the crew will have to be let go a second time. I don't want any unexpected moves, all right? I'm watching you. - Man, everything's lookin' good. All right. Thank you so much. Good to see you guys. Everything's looking good, right? Let's make a movie. All right, cool. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, okay everyone. Listen up, because Jake is still suffering from jet lag, today we only have a light rehearsal day, all right. At least we don't waste our film. (phone ringing) Okay, get back to work. - Should we tell him it's a digital camera? - No, man, don't worry about him. So look, I just want you to push the button all the way through, and we're gonna shoot this from where Cynthia escapes inside the door. I can just cut it from the footage up to that moment. - No need to explain. I remember it very well. That's when Miss hysterical quit the movie. - Exactly, don't worry, I rewrote it. We're gonna finish this. - Okay. - Let's roll as we go. - Just as we have meet. - All right. - Turn your gear on, please. Rehearsal. - Cut. - [Man] That was great. - [Jake] Tell me we got that. - [Man] Are you stupid or what? - Oh, we're movin' on. All right, so let's go and push in... - Hey, hey hey. Give me five. What the hell was that? You almost crashed two cars! - Well, I just wanted to be like the real Jake, you know, because I don't know if you know this, but he does his own stunts. - Hey! Did you see enough? It's not so exciting from up close, is it? So, if you don't mind, we might as well go? - Hey guys, breaking for lunch. Be back in 30. - You stay here with me. Think I remember that you owe me lunch. Oh, and actually, we're gonna need you to get ready, because we're gonna shoot your scene right after lunch. Need to get into makeup. Cover that up. Good job. - Your turn. - May I see it? - Yeah. Actually, here. This is, read this. - I know you're wired, Claudia. Who sent you? Let me go, I'm not a double agent. - The only way you could know the codes is if you killed Simon Red. Now you look me in the eyes and tell me you don't work for them. - I set you up, yes, but I had no choice. They have my sister and will only let her go in exchange for the codes. - I'm not buying the story about your sister, Claudia. - That's it? - That's it. - That's the end? - You don't like it? - Well, I was only thinking I kind of like it when movies have happy endings. (groaning) - You sound like the studio execs. Mr. Griffin, what about the audience? They love the happy endings. - They don't know. - You know what. You might be onto something. - All right, guys. See ya at rehearsal, please. - [Woman] Rehearsal. - [Man] Ready, whenever you are. - Listen up, everyone. I got some bad news. Jake Griffin doesn't feel well today, which means we have to stop filming today. There is no filming, friends. You can all go home... Hey. - [Director] And action. - Get your hands off me. - Claudia, honey, I love you. Let's forget this whole thing happened, and start over. I wanna start all over. - Go, go go! - Our new life together. (grunting) (groaning) (groaning) Cut! - Great. - That was good, that was good. Hey, that felt good. You all right? Yeah? Cut means stop. - [Man] Print that. - Let me take that one too. - You know what? If we are done here, I grab my boat and cruise down to Danube. - You can come if you'd like. It's a big boat. - [Jake] I didn't know you guys had a boat. - Not for long. Mike loves it, but it costs a bit too much. - Oh, come on. I gotta give cheers. Cheers to boys and their toys. - Okay. - May they always have them. - Cheers. That's good. Zoya. Zoya, Zoya, Zoya. Zoya. Grow up, don't let him get to you. No guy is worth it. Huh? - [Jake] Zoya. - Oh. - Is this a private party? Came out here to finish a movie. Who knows? It may be the last film I ever get to make. Tomorrow's my last day on set, so I go say my goodbyes and get some closure. It'd be nice to have you there with me. (gentle music) - Is this for real? - [Man] Jake! Get over here! - Just you and me. - Let's get out of here. - [Man] Come on, let's do it. (dramatic music) - Oh yeah. (laughing) - [Jake] Stop. (gasping) (laughing) - Okay, help me up. (laughs) (laughs) - [Man In Backseat] What if he didn't take off, and they just spent the night together? Hmm? I'll go look. - We're going to die. - No, we are not. - We are going to die. - No, we are not. - No sign of Zoya. Just a sick, bald cat. - We are going to die. - What are you thinking about? - Success and failure, and how thin the line is that separates the two. - What's the first movie you remember watching? - It was a story about a kid and his grandfather, and they ran away from home together. It was a terrible film. But it was starring a bright and hopeful young actor named Jacob Griffin. My first movie. That was the first movie I actually saw. I was four years old when I shot it. I grew up in studios. (gentle music) - I grew up in the theater, because my mother was a ballerina, and that's what I thought I wanted to be too for a long time. I thought I would be just like her. But I've realized since then that classical, not good at it anyway. Modern dance is much more interesting. - I think I have an idea. You're not gonna like it. So, this is a stage of sorts. All right. - What are you doing? - Here. Let me see that. Are you ready? - Ready for what? - To show me the real Zoya. (rhythmic drumming) (dramatic music) Don't try to be someone you're not. It's not worth it. - [Richie] Oh, look at that. Dumb shit made that little girl completely fall for him. That's just great. - [Mark] He's messing with our lives. He's been MIA all day. We gotta get rid of him. (gentle music) - Yeah, bud, of course. No, you can definitely trust me. (grunting) Who is that? I don't know what to do. - Hi. - Hey Zoya. No one's here, but you're here, huh. - Always. But I learned to play a little poker. - Well, that's good. Hey, so good news. I finished the film. Yeah, and I guess Mark got me some congratulatory farewell dinner in some restaurant. The yacht club called Melba. Yeah. - I guess this is goodbye then. - Oh, okay. - Bon appetite. - [Jake] Hey. (laughing) - Oh God. (laughs) - It's a dinner for two. - Jake, is it you? - Yeah, hey Cynthia Star. This is Jake Griffin. - Sweetie, did I wake you? I feel so bad for hurting you. How can I make it up to you? Hmm? - I got an idea. Come on in. - Everything is set here. - They will have a final date. Tearful farewell. - [Woman] Uh-huh. - Job done, case closed. - They'll have a nice romantic night. Some dancing, and then off to bed in separate rooms, of course. - We will join you at the boat after we clear out the studio. - Okay. - Hawk to the nest. Hawk to the nest. Come in nest. - Stop, you idiot. If you screw this up, you won't just lose your job. I'll cut your head off, and I mean it. - Sorry. Everything is set. Cameras and microphones are in place. Trust me. I know what I'm doing. - The happy couple is on their way. We'll be over as soon as I let this useless crew go. - I bet this is the easiest job these film people ever had. What a waste. - The camera man was a really nice guy. He recorded the whole thing for this American. - He what? - You know, as a souvenir. He can show his grandkids. - And you let this happen? What if he puts it on YouTube or sells it to a network? - Well, luckily we won't live long enough to see that happen. Hey, congratulations, Buddy, you just outdid yourself again. - Okay, I'm gonna have a talk with this guy. I'm not paying him until I get the film back. Buddy, pull up his contract. It just doesn't adapt. I call Mimi and check into this guy. You go through his stuff. - Okay. - I'm a genius. You thought you could take me for a fool? (speaking foreign language) - Cheers. (glasses clanking) - Is that Buddy? - [Zoya] Buddy? - You think that's Mark's boat? - I have an idea. Come with me. Grab the champaign. (dramatic music) - I'd like to show you something. Oh shoot. He took the boat, the girl and my laptop. - They have to come back sooner or later, okay? I'm going up to the apartment. You calm down and wait. - Hey. Look, I figured something out all by myself. - Relax, please. Wait here. Do you understand me? - Yes. Just wait. - Okay.

Everything we've been filming is on this little... What's wrong with you? - Mimi just e-mailed me this video from Jake's house. Check it. The chick says he's a fake Jake. - I'm a little bit confused now. I mean, I don't get this. What does that mean? - What do you think that means? - Wow. (gentle music) - [Jake] Whoa. Zoya. (laughs) (gentle music) - Ow. (dramatic music) - [Jake] Morning. - How much do you get paid per kiss? You're a liar. I hope you've enjoyed yourself, John Green. - Zoya, hey now, come on. - No. - Zoya. Look, I can explain this, all right. This isn't what you think it is. - Really. - It's actually kind of a funny story. It's gonna make a good movie one day. - A movie? - Yes. - Go to hell. Whoever you are. - Zoya, come here. - [Zoya] Get away from me. (phone ringing) - About time, Yvonne. - Get up. We have a situation on the water. - [Man] Guys, guys. - [Yvonne] I'll come meet you. (dramatic music) - [Jake] Zoya. - [Zoya] Go to hell. - We are going to die. - Oh, come on. - [Jake] Zoya. - [Zoya] Don't try to be someone you're not. It's not worth it, remember? - No, I just need to know who you are. Are you the sweet girl I've been hanging out with? Or the spoiled brat whose big brother bought her a boyfriend? - What's my brother got to do with this? - No, did you pick me out of a catalog? - I thought you cared about me. I thought you wanted to help. I guess I was wrong. Oh, you think you can solve everything with your money? Well spent, you bought yourself a cheap fake. Let me introduce you to John Green. - No, you know what. Actually, yeah, let's clear up any misunderstandings and talk about that for a second. - Hey, who are you? Hey, what is my sister talking about? Who is this guy? - I can explain everything. - Jake. Hi Jake. I came as fast as I could. Hi, hi everybody. So, Cynthia came over. She was kind of drunk, and we, uh, she knows I'm not you. Anyway, she was on the airplane, and she's on her way here right now. - So, like I told you, it's a funny story. - Jake. What's going on here? - Hi Cynthia. - Cynthia, what are you doin'? (laughing) Lovely as ever, Cynthia. - I can't believe you did this. You know who I am? I will destroy your stupid movie. Go to hell, Jake. - No, thanks, we broke up. I love you. - Where did you find this nobody? Is this the best you could do? - Awe, your ex girlfriend. Charming. - Charming. - [Man] Hey. (grunting) - Hey. - [Cynthia] And who are you? - That's unbelievable. It seems that you have completed your contract. - There was never a question. - Uh-huh. - It wasn't necessary to threaten us with your goons. Dude. - I have no idea what are you talking about. These gentlemen are my colleagues. I'm sorry if they threatened you. - Maxim deals in diamonds with stores all over Europe. While you were screwing around in the states, I googled the guy. - That's, that's impressive. Really, really impressive. You couldn't let us in on it? - I tried. Remember? Hi babe, going to sleep now. - I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just want you to know that you will get the success fee as it was promised. Of course there is one thing I can not understand. How can you possibly talk a Hollywood star to act like his own lookalike? And why? - That's a great secret. It's what makes us unique and successful. (laughing) (uplifting music) (doorbell chiming) - [Man] Who is it?
