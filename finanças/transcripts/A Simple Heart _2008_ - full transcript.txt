I'm Théodore. And you? Félicité. Like my scarf? Yes. A SIMPLE HEART Félicité, you're crazy. Could have hurt you. Must get back to work. You too. Sunday, I'll get a cart. I'll take you to the shore. Stop. I know a place. We'll be alone. Just you and me. Yes? You don't talk much. It's OK. I'm not into chatty lasses. We could get married. If you wanted it, belle If you wanted it, belle We could sleep together We could sleep together In a big square bed In a big square bed In the middle of the bed In the middle of the bed The river is deep The river is deep... We'll go to the sea next time. We'll sleep together We'll sleep together... Félicité? I'm Théodore's friend. - Where is he? - You won't see him again. - I won't see him again? - He left with another. A rich old woman that pays for his exemption. He's leaving for Valmont. He's done with you. - Done with me? - That's life. - We arranged to meet. - You won't see him again. Come on, now. I'll get you a drink. We'll toast him. He didn't say you were feisty! He's taking me to the sea! We're getting married! Shut up! - What is it? - I want to work for you. - Who are you? - Félicité. I worked for the Langeois. I left them yesterday. The Langeois farm. I see. It's far. Who told you I needed someone? What happened to you? You're not pregnant, I hope? No. The summer room. We don't use it. We can't heat it in winter. Here are my children. Paul and Clémence. They look just like their father. You saw his portrait on the ﬁreplace. Your tasks with them are simple. Dress, feed and sit them. That's it. The dining room. And the kitchen. Your domain. We never go there. Hello. I'm Liebard. I skin the sheep for Mrs. Aubain. Do we know each other? |‘m g0if19- She doesn't know me. I've seen her many times in the ﬁelds. She's not like the others. Meaning? She's different. How? People think she's odd. And I... Very well. Get rabbits. I want to ﬁnd out how to cook them. Mom. Didn't mean to interrupt. - Hello, Frédéric. - We're done. Clemence is exceptionally motivated for her age. - I was thinking... - And Paul? He's doing very well. It's perfect, then. Felicite, accompany the gentleman. Thank you Frederic. Faster! You fell! Again! I forbade you to do that with my children. You're not here to play but to cook, clean and do the assigned chores. How inappropriate. Since you have so much free time, you'll take care of the laundry from now on. And I... I forbid you to sing all day long. My nana. Slop! Here, Clémence. So the priest no longer wants to come play? You'll have to apologize ﬁrst. You went too far last week. Bourais, your turn. There. - Frédéric, you have to mount. - Mount? Mount on me. You must mount on her. Sorry. You'd better learn how to play. I hate losing. For you, I'd learn walking on my hands. I'm only asking you to play your cards right. Your turn. - Did we get that hand? - No, I won it, Frédéric. Bourais, your turn. - Can l? - Please. Thank you. Nana, can you play with me? No time, miss. - Thank you. - My turn. Your turn. My dear Mathilde, it seems you're cheating... Yes, we won this hand. I knew it! Honest mistake! The doctor's thirsty. And if I calculated right, we also won the last one. ls that the sea? You coming? Go back. Slowly. I'll draw his attention. Go back. Go! Farther! Hurry LIP! Get them in bed. I'm exhausted. That bull... Don't worry about your foot. If it were broken, you wouldn't be able to walk. Please. Nana, please. All right. - Félicité? - Yes, madam? Starting tomorrow you'll take Clémence to Bible study. - May I go in? - Where? The church. You're kidding me? - Aren't you baptized? - I don't know. You don't know? She never knows anything. Around him, all kinds of colored birds. He was in awe. He told his comrades: "Wait for me here. "|‘|| preach to the birds. "Brothers, praise our Creator. "He gave you freedom to ﬂy." All birds instantly ﬂew to him. All of them stayed still and kept quiet until he ﬁnished preaching. They only ﬂew away once the blessing was over. You know why St. Francis liked birds so much? They take our prayers to Heaven. Who will give this one a prayer? Very well. We'll free him. Nana, make me as pretty as you. You think I'm pretty? Of course. What's wrong with you? You're hurting me. You're creasing my dress. What did the doctor say? Same as usual, sweetie. We know you're fragile. But it's nothing serious. Your stern little look reminds me of your father. Poupart recommends sea bathing. It won't be easy. The luggage, getting ready... We'll make two trips. We'll stay at our farm? Yeah. Nice house, huh? It's the old Lehoussai‘s. She married a deserter. And he got an exemption. Poor Théodore, not a bad guy. Courage-wise, though... Théo... You want to rest here? You'd be better outside, no? I like the smell of this room. I should sweep a little, though. No. We're not touching a thing. I can feel him here. Everything started here. On May 14, on this meridienne. He was shy at ﬁrst. It was so good. Like in novels. But you can't relate to that. Nothing to reminisce. You're lucky. Come here. Thanks for helping. It's not easy. My pleasure. I wanted to ask you... You know I'm a widower. I'd like to marry you. We'd get along, no? Been thinking about it for a while. That day in Yvetot, in your kitchen. I brought wool. Remember? No. $0? Mrs. Aubain needs me. She'll understand. She's not a bad woman. Don't worry about a thing. I'll talk to her. You like me a little, don't you? The rest will come with time. Stop it! What are you doing? I'm leaving. Going to look for work. You can't do that to me. I need my wages. I never meant to ﬁre you. It's a misunderstanding. I... I don't know, I... I was shocked. I didn't mean it. Actually, what did I say? I don't want you to leave. I'll give you a raise. And Clémence? Think about her. She'll get ill over it. She's so fragile. The doctor says to avoid upsetting her. It could be lethal. You do love her, don't you? Yes, you do. Look. Little Félicité? You don't recognize me? She's Félicité, but she's big. And she only has us. Well, she's my sister. Tell her you know me. No? Come. Come, now. I work over there. Pass by. I thought you had no family. We lost touch since my parents' death. I thought... ...she was dead? Poor dear. You can't see beyond your nose. Lucky you! You're treated like a queen. I don't own anything. I get 10 francs monthly. 10 francs? She's a thief. - But you eat all you want. - I bought the cheese. - You sleep there? - Yes. - Here. - Thank you. Can I kiss him? Go ahead. He's your nephew. Victor? My nephew? You are my sister, dummy! You even have two. The older works on the trawler. My nephew. Can he play with me? Of course. But be quiet. Madam's resting. Come. What is he doing here? Stop! Listen... my heart's beating so fast. Will he leave her alone? Félicité here? They're at the beach. I'd like some water. Here. Well... we're both widowed. I longer than you. So you'll understand. I want to marry again. You've never thought about it? I can't live alone anymore. I want to marry her. - Who? - Félicité. It's in your best interests, for the farm. We need a woman around. And children, life. - Things would improve... - You're out of your mind. Get a hold of yourself, Liébard. And never mention it again. OK, sweetie. You're healed. And I'm tired of the country. - We're going home tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Yes. . M om? ‘ Yes? I'm happy to go back. Good. Are you happy with us? Yes. - Will you leave us? - No. Not anymore. Good. We're heading back tomorrow. Tomorrow, already? You really don't have the notion of time. At least, you never get bored. I'd like to have my nephew over on Sunday. At my home? In Yvetot? My sister said I could see him every Sunday. Sunday's a day of rest. It's the law. As long as he behaves. Grope around From the breast To the leg The beast jumped at once And slid in a little higher After so many tickles She ended up wet And drowned the insect Finally, the little one Exhaled all his might And wanted to try... Shut up, Fabu. He's too young for that. It's not that bad. And the cabbage? I'll teach you other ones. A little drink? - Not today. - OK then. All right. Why can't I see her anymore? You're too old to play together. You understand, right? Clémence, hand me the yarn. No, my book. After my communion, will I be sent to the nuns? Of course, my daughter. I don't want to go. I want to stay here. You'll like living with girls your own age. Your brother likes it. It'll be harder for me. But I'm not like him. They loved each other so much they couldn't be apart. They slept in each other's arms. It ended up making a big hole in the middle of the bed. Like a channel. A river. Sing it again. We could sleep together We could sleep together In a big square bed In a big square bed Adorned with white lace... Corpus Christi. Corpus Christi. Amen. I wanna wait for her. You can't. She's at the market. You'll see her for Christmas. Be strong, my daughter. Here. Thanks. Want some? I'm sure Clémence is underfed over there. Hold the bow. Knees together. Sit up straight. Relax your hand. Let me guide you. Press hard. ls it for Clémence? Yes. I miss her. Then bring her back. Why suffer like this? She's learning to be a woman. You think the nuns know how? Shut up, Félicité. So I feed the fisherman's son every Sunday now? No. I use my wages. What do you mean? You don't eat on Sundays? It's a pleasure seeing him eat. And fasting is good for you. I love your country smell. I'll get it. Madam! They're here. - Hi, Mom. - Hello, my children. I missed you. You too Clémence. You're pretty, little Clémence. My daughter's a beautiful young lady. Show some respect from now on. I have a headache. I'll get you some tea. No need. Going to my room. She didn't change one bit. Always something wrong. Thank you, it was delicious. You can go now. Tomorrow, Frédéric will be visiting. Not for a lesson, I hope. It's a shame you stopped. What got into you? Learning the cello! I don't need you, Félicité. You earned a night off. I'm not tired. You must have so much to tell. Maybe Paul. Nothing happens in my prison. Félicité, go to your bedroom. How was it with Clémence? She's tired. Still in bed. Dr. Poupart came today. The climate's not good for her. They have to go to Provence. And? It's far. Very far. Even for her daughter? Incredible. It's not that far. You'd get to travel. Here, Auntie. For me? It's pretty! - It's too pretty. - Nicer than your lover's, huh? Victor! Thank you. Tea, sweetie? - Frédéric? - Thank you. Do you still like singing? Clémence lost her tongue. Paul will be here any minute. Will you stay for dinner? If it's no bother. Of course not. Right, Clémence? Where are you going? Stay. She has so many lovers She has so many lovers She can't pick one She can't pick one If you wanted it, belle If you wanted it, belle We could sleep together We could sleep together In a big square bed In a big square bed Adorned with white lace Adorned with white lace At all four corners At all four corners A bouquet of periwinkles A bouquet of periwinkles... Let me get off. We're gonna get hurt, Victor. I have to go to the river. You eat enough on your boat? Can't complain. It's not your cooking, though. Here. That's thoughtful. I wanted to tell you... I've been hired. That's great! Congrats, my nephew! I found out yesterday, but was afraid to tell you. - Why? - I'll be gone for two years. Two years? America's farther than southern France. You can't go. I board tonight in Le Havre. Tonight? I don't want you to. You just arrived. Stay. Take the next boat. I'll hide you. No one will know. I don't want you to leave me. Stay. I'll write. I promise. You can't leave me, Victor. You can't leave me. Stop it. I need you. Two years will go by fast. You'll see. Calm down. Auntie! Sorry. Have a good trip, Victor. Why are you leaving like that? Come back! - Did Fabu pass by? - Yes. No letters. I don't understand. Clémence stopped writing. She always responds. I don't understand. Don't worry. It's also been three months for me. What has? No news from my nephew, Victor. What are you talking about? How is it the same? May Victor be safe. May Victor be safe. I found work at Mrs. Arnaud‘s. I leave for Rouen tomorrow. Rouen? I don't know her. So you're leaving Yvetot. ls it ﬁnal? It depends on you. Don't say stupidities. You're absurd. Please accompany the gentleman. He's leaving for Rouen. Again, you are the only one... I was just thinking about you. Did you get Father Ouard‘s order? I'm a little tight right now. A fox killed six of them. What about your dog? He's ill. He's in the barn. Should I believe you? You sure you didn't sell all your chickens? You can tell me. What's wrong? For me? How did you manage? You can't write, I can't read. Doesn't help. It's not me. Who, then? - Your sister gave it to me. - It's Victor. It's from city hall. Arriving at Havana. TVPhus. - He's really dead. - Yes. You want some time off? What about visiting your sister? - She doesn't care. - Don't say that. It's her son. Snow. They're crab-apple tree petals. It's spring, Félicité. Spring? My laundry! Paul, you're bothering her. Leave her alone. You drank too much. Black suits you. - Where did you get that brooch? - That's enough. Bedtime. Your sister isn't coming. Too weak to make the trip maybe. I'll go get her, then. Paul, stop it. I'm not tired. I'm going out. Tell Paul when he gets back and join us at the convent. Very well. Stop! Take me! I need to go to Evreux. No room for you, cripple. She'll keep watch over the body. She deserves it. Am I pulling your hair? My little Clémence. You'll go join Victor now. In a big square bed In a big square bed Adorned with white lace Adorned with white lace In the middle of the bed In the middle of the bed The river is deep The river is deep... Madam? Why doesn't Frédéric come anymore? You know why. Maybe, but I don't understand. - If I were you... - Have tea with me. Don't kid me. I have work to do. What a nice bird. His name is Loulou. He's from America, like us. From America? Really? Wanna hold it? Sure. - Don't be scared. - Madam? What is it? "Mrs. Aubain, dear neighbor, "we're leaving on short notice and can't take Loulou. "We're giving it to you "as a souvenir and a sign of our respect." What does it mean? Who's this crazy person? ls it a joke? ls she making fun of me? It's my fault. It's the neighbor. I told her daughter you loved parrots. I'm sorry I lied. Why? Because I wanted it badly. It's yours. Thank you, madam. He's the same color as my scarf. And he's from America, like my nephew. Will you leave him alone? Polly and I get along just ﬁne. Loulou. Not a parrot's name. - Another drink? - Enough. Back to work. You're hard on me. All right. My Loulou. Navigate! Loulou. Madam! He spoke! Loulou? What are you doing up there? I asked everybody. No luck. Why did you go to Melaine? The pharmacist's son saw him there. - I was laughed at. - I don't like that boy. Loulou. Fabu found her this morning. I went to bed early. I took laudanum. I had no idea. She spent the night outside, on the ﬂoor. There's nothing to worry about. I'll do whatever‘s necessary. Even go down south if I must. There's no need this time. Shouldn't be any complications. I'll pass by tomorrow. You scared me. Loulou. I brought you here with Loulou. You're better here. It's more comfortable. It rains in your bedroom. Why didn't you say anything? I'm deaf. I'm deaf. My treasure. My little treasure. I love you. My Loulou. My treasure. My Théo. My Loulou. Could you bring more laudanum? I broke the vial. Again? I regret our card games. I'd bet you're cheating. You must be careful. Laudanum is very dangerous. To God this prayer's impure. It's tangled with the dregs of sensuality. We must deliver ourselves from all concupiscence dregs so our prayer be pure in front of God. My God, forgive me for I've sinned. I dreamt about Théodore again. My Théo. I dreamt of his kisses. His lips. His smell. His skin. I'm forgetting what he looks like. He looks like Victor. What did they do to you? Fabu killed you. It's Fabu. No, Félicité. No. It's the cold. Félicité. He died from cold. Someone left the window ajar. Bad man. Always around you, teaching you bad things. I'm done with church. Hello. Hello! You're beautiful. My treasure. I'm a virgin. Where did you get that dress? I'll walk through church with my fiancé on my shoulder. Loulou agreed. Walk through church? I'm beautiful. You can't. Not in the virgins' procession? It's absurd. I'm beautiful. Félicité. I'm beautiful. Félicité. only young girls parade in white dresses. Yes. With white ﬂowers in my hair. I don't care about other people. I can't hear them anyway. Félicité? How I loved. Félicité? How I loved. - You sure? - She's there. Come. Fabu... I know you killed... I forgive you. Me? Killed Mrs. Aubain? - She's crazy! - She's always been a bit off. I'll get the doctor. Get the priest instead. Loulou. Loulou. It's the virgins' procession. They're lucky. The nice weather's back. They're charming. Can you hear? I forget she's deaf. Can't believe she wanted to be part of it. The air feels so nice... Translation: Maria Angélica Noél
