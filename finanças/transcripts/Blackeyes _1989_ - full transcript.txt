Let this be a lesson to you officer. Don't mess around with toy boats on the bleeding pond. Yes, sir. She was something special, whoever or whatever she was. My Christ, this was a beauty. Yes, sir. Back yourself up, lad. Okay, sir. The question is, why be a snitch, will you? The question is, did she wait until dark to do this to herself or did somebody else give her a helping hand? [bright upbeat music] Spit on me, spit on me. No, no, Jessica, I don't want to write a dirty book. I'm not a gasp and groan merchant. No plastic, male fantasies, thank you very much. I want to hunt down a real woman. [bright jazz music] A model, Jessica, like you used to be. I want to find out what it was like. I want you to tell me exactly what happened to you and where and how. Nobody will recognise you, of course. I'll change names, places, that sort of thing, I'll even change the colour of your hair, your eyes. Give me the facts and I'll adorn them in my own way. Trust me, my dear. Trust me, I won't let you down. I want you to open up your life to your old uncle. Open up like the petals of a primrose after a summer shower. [Jessica] My life. [Maurice] What? [Jessica] In your words. [Maurice] You see my dear, I propose to create an enchanting creature. [Jessica] Oh, yes. With your experience of that world to help me. An enchanted creature in a fairy tale. Fairy tale? Once upon a never. Her skin was as white as snow, her hair as black as ebony, and her lips as red as the blood that had not yet been spilled. There's no bonking in fairytales Uncle Maurice. Bonking, what's that? Ah, no, but there's lots of cruelty, that's the only way they could fit in a happy ending. [eerie music] The single white sail of a child's toy boat, dipping in the dawn light, was the only but in different witness to her melancholy. The water came over her shining boots, swallowed up her knees and long thighs, and then made a line around the naked swell of her belly. In next to no time, there was nothing but her head to be seen, then a few strands of floating black hair, and soon she was completely submerged with no sign of fuss or struggle. [applauding] It must not be presumed, that I wouldn't be so brutishly inelegant as to conclude my, no doubt, already grievously inadequate novel, with the suspended word struggle. [audience laughing] And soon she was completely submerged with no sign of fuss or struggle. Whatever traces she may have left on the lives of others, this girl, she had gone now, without a ripple. The waters smoothed itself flat and reflected back to the sky. [audience applauding] You, killer. I want you to entrust me with your life, Jessica, your days as a model, things that happened to you, all that sort of thing. -My life. -I'd like you to begin by telling us who you are, angel, your name please. What's wrong, angel, cat got your tongue? My name is Blackeyes. Oh, is it now? And were you told by any chance that I wanted to look at fair damsels, only fair damsels, ladies with blonde locks, ladies with blue eyes, yes? Ladies with complexions of peaches and yoghourt. What sorts of yoghourt? Wit no less. Nobody said anything to me about yoghourt, I would have remembered. Well, isn't that just too tedious. Tedious for you, tedious for me. I'm afraid you rather wasted your time, angel. I'm so sorry. Mr. Stilk. There was something. It seems to me that since the young lady is here and the last one we are seeing today, why not let her have a go? It's not exactly as though we've already hit upon the ideal candidate, is it? That would be different matter. No, we haven't found the right one. No, I think perhaps we need a little more patience for that Mr. Jamieson. But, yes, why not? Thank you. What did you say you called yourself dear? Blackeyes. Blackeyes. What we have here, Blackeyes, is a dry run audition, understand? Now, no sort of formal structure's gonna be imposed on you, okay? In other words, Blackeyes, there is no carapace, no hard shell. Or hard shell, come to that. All is fluid, plastic, it is about your perceptual parameters, -your inventiveness. -Yes. What? Yes, I said yes. Yes, you said yes. Yes, what? Yes, what about? About all of that. Try not to interrupt please. Okay, let's begin again. In terms of the basic order of things, the reality, there is a bottle on the table. Yes. There is a bottle on the table, there is music, there will be light, which can and will change colour and intensity and there is you. Me? Yes. My sweet Christ, yes. We want, I want, to see what happens when the bottle, the you and the music are put together, that's the dry run. You can do anything you yourself choose to do. Let me tell you my girl, you're a damn fine filly yourself, always thought so. Yes, you have. [slow orchestral music] Go ahead, please. That's it my little one, dream your pretty little dreams. May I venture to ask, because I'm sure we're all dying to know, just what exactly do you think is in the bottle? Something delicious. My dear young lady, it is a body lotion. A moisturiser, which is also a sun filter, and also an anti cellulite. You rub it in, tub it in. But you may drink it if you really want to. Tell us what it tastes like, dear. When I sit to rub it in Mr. Stilk, I didn't mean that you want to do so. I think the joke is over, don't you? Do you want me to use it, sir? I'm afraid you rather squandered your allocation, dear. You were given four minutes and I don't think you did... Yes, use it. [All] Use it, use it. Really, I don't know why you want me here at all? Calm, calm, calm. No, this is demeaning. Andrew, Andrew, Andrew. You know very well how much we all value you, but don't we, gentlemen? This whole setup is yours, these are your ideas, your parameters. This is humiliating. But the young lady might as well continue now that we've had out amusement. Might she not. Guess who, flower? She felt his look go through her to the middle. The music had begun gain, suggesting the sea, a blanched ocean like a bed sheet ramping against the naked sand. Blackeyes willowed a little at the hips as her emptied out thoughts picked up and clung to the thread of the saxophone, she followed it past a shingle of violins and arm out into the deepest part of the sea. A sigh that was almost a shadow of release went up from the seated gentlemen. Her nipples had spoken to them. "Have we got a job?" they asked. "Yes, we've got the job," they said. The tacky ooze trickled towards them, the oil of anointment. She was moving amongst the fishes and the waving front. "I am a mermaid," whispered the music at the edge of her mind. "I am a mermaid," said her own thoughts in echo, "a mermaid." There's some sort of reflection happening here. There's a very definite upshine, you know what I mean? It's ruining what is in fact a terrific set of head shots. Ah, your top. Your top, Blackeyes, it's coming up from your top. I mean, that's why I said for you to wear off the shoulder in the first place. You see skin, skin don't reflect the same. Damn it, it is you're bloody top love after all that, would you believe it? No, I don't think that we should compromise it, do you? I mean, you don't get anywhere in this business by accepting second best. Take it off. Sure. Oh, you're a professional. What more can one say? You're gonna go a long way. I mean, it's the attitude that counts as well as everything else it takes body-wise. You with me? Yes. Okay. Yes. Your bra, it's almost the same colour as your top, isn't it, darling? Now, same colour, same problem. Do you think? You cruel old devil. I hope it chokes you. That one. That one, are you sure? That one. Oh, yes, that's the one. If you want my little chickadee. Yes, yes. You shall have it. But are you sure that of all his lonely little dollies who have no mommy, that that is the one you really want? Yes. Well, well, well, and what will you give me? Will you give me a big kiss? Or is that just for dolly? * 'll never smile again * * Until I smile at you * * I'll never laugh again * * What good would it do * Spit on me. * For tears would fill my eyes * * My heart would realise * * That our romance is through * * I'll never love again * * I'm so in love with you * * I'll never thrill again * * To somebody new * * Within my heart * * I know I will never start * * To smile again * * Until I smile at you * [Blackeyes] Jessica, get me out of this story, please. The dirty old man. I'm sick. What? I heard a dance band. What do you mean you feel sick? S-I-C-K. Before these big palaces on the south coast, coy ain't they grand, marooned in her own past, of course, pic holding worth it? Sick, we're all sick. That's why they have these fancy dress things and whatnot. Nostalgia, playing all the old numbers. I'd hate to go myself. Christ embalming fluid. I've got better stuff than that in my own loins. It was nice. The music, it sounded nice. Not for a modern girl like you darling. You move to a different tune. We'll do this again really soon. Thank you, I enjoyed it. Me too. I know where to find you. Tomorrow tea time maybe, when you finished the shoot.

I'm trapped, I'm trapped, I'm trapped, I'm trapped, I'm trapped, I'm trapped. Jesus, why won't you help? [Blackeyes] I'm trapped, I'm drowning in an old man's filth. Help me, Jessica, help me, Jessica. That's the idea, retire from the fame, yes. I can't say I care too much for country life, do you? I like to open my front door on the streets. God, I like this room. Jolly nice, isn't it? It's all right. And so are you. Oh my gosh, yes I'll say. You look very good at this sort of thing, you know. It's not any of the walls that are wall at you. Wood, all wood everywhere. There's cladding, do you understand? No. I didn't think you would. No, not a splendid young girl. My God, you are a lovely. What's the matter? I'm tired. Go on, you're tired. Oh, no. You're to young. Little girl. Likkle girlie. You've no wooden walls around you. Actually, I think you're more like a cat, one of those slick and slinky. No. Oh, yes. No. Oh, my God. No. Oh, yes. Stop it. Look at that, be fair, be fair. I don't want it, no. All right, bash it all. You're more much of a sport, are you my girl? It's all very well. You just can't. You can't just. No? No. Oh, Christ, you sit there with your legs up to your bum, and your titties half hanging out and your eyes like. Don't you what it does to me? You need a good spanking little girl. All I wanted was a little cuddle. Sorry, no. -Sweetie, my sweetie. -No, no. No, stop it. Now, don't be silly. Please, oh, please, just please. You don't know what it's like. In much of the village here nowadays we have to be more and more imaginative with theatrical production value, creative boldness, intellectual innovation. No, stop it. Get off, get off of me. [screaming] Really, is there nowhere I left in England that does not resemble the centre court at Wimbledon? Bad mannered, suburban and full of freaking females. Stop, stop. No, no. Get off. No, no, stop it. No, get off me you bastard. What the hell is going on here? It maybe better to knock. Rupert. A little boisterous for me. I'm afraid our little girl is a little bit indisputable. This is disgraceful. Disgraceful, I will not tolerate it, do you hear? May I remind you you are my guest. Me, you're talking to me. You, yes you. Blackeyes, angel, why do you let yourself down like this? It's without dignity, now, isn't it without style. Can't you see that my darling? Aren't we all pals together? What exactly is the problem here? I shall smack. I can't believe this. Look, I'm not a... You're not what my dear? Not a sensible girl. I'm not a prostitute. [all laughing] Laughter, tears, what are they? Contortions of small ducts and muscle. Blackeyes cried a little more into the cup of her hand, then laughed some more. The bubbles climbed in joyous columns in the crystal flutes, and of rare English sun burnt its incurious light at the windows. What passes for passion amongst such people, blazed its own shoddy imitations. Small ducts and muscles. In time, the lovely young model with a thin ankle chain of gold, helped Blackeyes out of her torn clothing and then both of them lay down on the same bed under the same canopy on either side of the English gentleman. High finance and high fashion are not necessarily uneasy bedfellows. After all, after so much, what did it matter to Blackeyes? Did anyone ever expect her to be anything other than a commodity? [Jeff] Yes, I'm watching you. I'm always watching. I'm even watching myself, watching. It's time you made real space for Blackeyes, Jessica. Let her be in your room, not just your head and then I'll be able to see her at last. Please, sit down. Thank you. Thank you. Do you have any sugar? Do you take sugar? I usually do, yes. I'm not sure that I've gotten any. I'm not very good at this sort of thing. It doesn't matter, really. I know I had some once. No, I mean, sometimes I do and sometimes I don't. Actually, I think it really does taste better without sugar, you're right. It really does, does it? These muse houses can be very nice. Yes. I see the one opposite is up for sale. Is it? I mean, whoever buys it can look straight across and see. And see what? Us drinking tea. Goodness. Yes, I'm not exactly at ease, am I? Aren't you. Listen, I... Yes. I can't say I care too much for city life, do you? I'd like to open my front door onto fields and. I like this room though, small is beautiful. Beat that shoemaker. It's all right. It's very nice. It's just for me, nobody else comes here. What, never? You're the first. So I have penetrated the inner sanctum. I get laid other places, hotel rooms mostly Oh. What? Many. What are those? No, I mean men, many men. Yes, many, many. Sure, that's your... Very many. I've lost count. I got laid other places, hotel rooms mostly. [Blackeyes moaning] What? [Jeff] Many? Hotel rooms. [Jeff] No, I mean men, I mean many men. Yes, many, many. Sure, I mean that's your... Nice tea. No, there isn't any. Sorry. Sugar. It's fine, really. Oh, Christ. Blackeyes. Look, if you wanna go to bed, that's all right by me. Otherwise, I don't think we should compromise you, do you? No. [Blackeyes] I mean, it's the attitude that counts as well as everything it takes body-wise. [Jeff] You poor cow. [Blackeyes] What do you want? [Jeff] Oh, bloody idiot. Why do you say these things? What's the matter with you? I wanted. Shit, shit, shit. I'm sorry, this is ridiculous. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let's talk. What about? You. No, thank you. No, thank you. All right, let's talk about my book, talk about that? Trouble is I haven't written a word of it. Yet. [Blackeyes] What's it about? Well, my novel? It's about a disappointed obsessive who cannot stop spying on the woman who lives opposite. He's like an ornithologist. I mean, he's watching her every little movement. He sees everything she does, he studies her. [Blackeyes] Does she know that? [Jeff] No, not yet. [Blackeyes] Does he kill her? [Jeff] Maybe, maybe not. [Blackeyes] Don't you know? [Jeff] It was Kingsley who kills you by love and I read about it over and over. What else can I do? The last complete day of her life before Blackeyes drowned herself in cold water and icier despair, was that serenely bright under its blue glaze as any day in England can ever reasonably aspire to be. Do you know how much this is costing? So come on, what's wrong? What's really wrong? I don't know how to ride this thing. Stop it please, please. -I don't know how to ride. -Oh, shut up. Look love, all you gotta do is press this little button here. Can I say something? Will you listen to me? Yes, yes, of course. I don't know how to ride this thing. Shit, shit, shit, shit. [Director] We're ready here, any time you are. I'm gonna give you a second. I don't know how to ride this thing. Then get off it. Sure. Blackeyes, will you please get back on that bike? What? Get on the bike you bitch. Sure. Do it then, do it. All right, now we know where we are, let's get this straight. I'm the director here and I'm having no more of this shit from you or from anybody else. Are you with me? Do you'll finally understand that? Sure. No more, right? Right. Thank you. I shall be standing down there, halfway along between the two positions, yes? Yes. I shall raise my arm and then when I drop it, you will rev up this machine, that's one. Two, I shall raise my arm again and then when I drop it the second, when I drop it the second time, you will come down the road, full throttle, straight down the road as though straight at us and you continue. I don't know how to ride this thing. You bitch, you bitch. Hey, none of that. Shut your bloody mouth. Who do you think you are? You don't talk to me like that mate. We're ready when you are. What I'm gonna do is walk back along this track and wait for you to drive this machine, okay? You better try and do it love. Or else that puffed up little bugger will have a heart attack. I've had enough. I know. I've had enough of all of it, all of it. It's no big deal love. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. [motorbike engine roaring] Well, that was a busy all day, wasn't it? That's it, that's it my little one, dream your pretty little dream. Our Father who art. Who is a little sleepy head. * Drove she ducklings to the water * * And her shoes were number nine * * Herring boxes, without topses * * Sandals were for Clementine * * Oh my darling, oh my darling * * Oh my darling, Clementine * * You are lost and gone forever * * Gone forever, Clementine * * Gone forever, Clementine * How did she manage to get back into London? Who? Blackeyes. [Maurice murmuring] What? Uncle Maurice, what, what, what are you talking about? Jessica. Yes. You were always my favourite, always. Is there any? Jessica, my dear, is there any more wine? No. No? Nope, none. Oh, God. Finito, like me, like you. That's a bad show, Jesse. That's very disappointing, very. I've had a sort of day. If only you knew. [Blackeyes] Jessica, get me out of this story, please. How did she get back? On the motorbike, Blackeyes. On motorbike? Oh, wake up. There is a gap in your story, there's a hole. What happened to the motorbike? How did she get back to London? Are you sure there's no more wine? [motorbike engine roaring] When they were ready, they start painting. I hate your book. You tried to steal my life, like you did when I was a little girl. Oh, yes, yes, but I've worked it all out. I got Blackeyes out of your head with no key. She's going to find something better than I did. You've interfered with her enough, interfered with me enough. [Jeff] Were so used to having their lives expressed in terms of male voices; male voices, male judgments, male desires. Blackeyes. Have you broken anything? What happened? Jessica, Jessica, have you gotten me out of the book? [slow orchestral music] I feel I've been thrown off the page by a giant. What? Look at me. Come on, look at me. Look at my finger. Giant. No, no, no, look at it. Keep your eyes on my finger. Come on. Good job. Are you in pain? Do you think you can stand up? My God. Careful, she's real. She's off the page. Jessica's got her out of the book. We'll go to a doctor, I can't send to you out here, can I? I can make her mine, really mine. Please let this be true. How are you feeling? Sore. But in one piece, I think. You know you really were very lucky. What? To crush a motorbike, or to have you come along? You could have broken your neck. Perhaps I have. No, no. Please, don't be afraid. I'm just glad I was near. But, what is this place? Paradise. Hey, listen. It's the name of the house. No, really, really it is. When you get to see it properly you'll know why it's called what it is. What are you doing here? Is it yours? Well, not exactly. I'm a glorified caretaker actually, so called assistant curator. This place has wonderful paintings and works of, ejecting my job. I didn't want to be a paid liar anymore. Copywriters are prostitutes. When did all this happen? Shortly after I, what's the phrase? Took tea with you. Tea for two, and two for tea. Me for you and you for me. * Alone * Sorry, sorry. Sorry, it's a song. Yes, a song. Sorry. I thought that. Yes. I thought that you were writing a book. [Jeff] No darling, I'm not. I'm rewriting a book. Look upon it as a piece of literary criticism. Look at my hands, look at my fingers. A man of letters, yes. You ought to have some verse read over you. Trouble is uncle wankle, who's a little sleepy head? Trouble is I can't remember any poems and it's getting cold. If I should die think only this of me, that there is some corner of a foreign field that is forever England. Sorry, that will have to do. No, no. Oh, no, no, uncle. Please don't uncle, I don't want to. I don't want you to make me, no. Oh, my God, I'm sticky. Sticky uncle. I'm sticky uncle. * Oh my darling, oh my darling * * Oh my darling, Clementine * * You are lost and gone forever * Paragraph. [Maurice] Trust me, my dear. Trust me. I won't let you down. [Jessica] When you are a model and your looks, your body is the main thing you have to sell, your prime asset so to speak, you kind of specialise. And someone else always has at least one physical quality that you yourself don't have like China doll eyes when yours are something else, silkier hair, or longer legs [Maurice] Or bigger titties. Good girl. [Maurice] No, no, Jessica, I don't want to write a dirty book. I want to hunt down a real woman. * Tea for two and two for tea * * Me for you and you for me * * Alone * Oh, Jessica changed Kingsley's ending all right. As her lungs filled, she at least had the satisfaction of knowing that Blackeyes was free. Well, sort of free anyway. Because now, she's mine. [slow jazz music] [bright classical music]
