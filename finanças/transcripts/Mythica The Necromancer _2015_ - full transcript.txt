It was a trap and went straight to her. Hundreds of his troops were waiting for me. I tried to use the portal. As a last resort to escape if you follow me here. And good. You know the rest of the story. Corlok has. Two pieces of dark seed now. So it has begun work to encourage the dead. If you join the four pieces. His legions of dead esparcerân and turn everything into a tomb. Be unstoppable. You never told me the whole story. How you stop to sherlock the first time? It was 21 years ago. And sherlock was digging deeper into the hidden magic. The invaders were on our doorstep. Intoxicated with a new source of power that sought to expand with dark seed. Joining would become the lich king, The teacher, death is itself. Fortunately. I turned against him before the end. Sherlock stopped. Although the kingdom cost him dearly. 9 now.

What happened? They have thane. You can not just be a man, right? We will go to his majesty. No no no. Thane is a condemned man. Convicted before you release it. Battalions only released him to carry out his execution. Everything is my fault. Peregun was behind me. We should go guild. Negotiate with Perego, use all the money we have left. Maybe we can pay for their release. I can not go. He should not even have come so far. I am sorry. To 9. Look. Thane and I may have our rivalries. And the gods know I wanted a couple of times to die, But I Perego. Peregun Mallister is a notorious vicious torturer. Thane and constantly suffira every minute until it is released or die. This is all the money I have. Take it. Thane you need. Marek. Happily take your place if your situation was the same. Is that what you want? I take your place? If it arrives. I will, you know. I can not. Everything is my fault. Nonsense, how can it be your fault? Dagen, are most familiar with the union than any of us. This is enough to free thane? Maybe I do not know. Could at least gain some time. You should come with us, marek. That only angered more to Mallister. Maybe, but I just think you should come. If nothing. If nothing works, then you must say goodbye to him. Hurry up, before it is too late. Not often a man in my position. Get all the pleasure of having a fighter in his hands. A is a very special occasion for me. And I would like you to know. Thane. My friends will come and find me. Mallister. For real. I'm anxious to hear from your peers. When your body dies and hang from the walls of the city. All know how serious I am. I have a reputation to uphold. If you were not afraid he would not have sent your friends about me. We can make a deal, Mallister. It can work for you. Keep it alive as long as you can. Enough! They hurt one more of my men and killed thane. Thanos kills and will be none to protect us. I guess who come here to save your life. Not to watch us die both. We brought money. But your man would not let us out. I say the word, tile. These worms have a clean shot. Later, matame. And let loose the rope and crushed his skull. It not, gives No. All right! Now we all know our options. Betilla. Peregun. These mercenaries. Solve our problems with the supply chain. Eel. If, eel. Do you say, marek? Dear? We should do other business? Do not listen to him. Kills his men tear out the heart as it beats. And teach them. Wait wait. Which is the work? A smuggler north of the border to us a large cargo. All you have to do is bring the cargo to me. And I forget all the offenses that made me thane. But. If they fail. Only need to MONR. Because not only do we pay what we bring? You have 20,000 gold coins in that bag of yours? Because that's what a load of ilistrium it! And it is four times less than it is worth my reputation! A reputation that was tarnished when fucker put a knife to her throat. And forced me to give freedom of that bitch. That bitch that I possess by right! Whether! Whether. Whether. That is the price of your freedom, slave. That's what you looked like. North of the border is a great area to look for a man. I need to thane for work. That's impossible.

To find Captain James Purio. Mallister believes they have what it takes. Mallister is a vile creature. And if it touches thane, I personally would slice her throat. For you. His comrade lives to suffer another day. Where you keep these creatures? It was not easy for you to come with us. I was wrong to accuse. Really was not myself when I said it. Forget this. I owe more thane anyone else. You 're not wearing your collar. I am no longer worthy to use the image of Nizet. You were not able to heal thane, but that goes for the rest of us? Maybe your goddess only removes the blessing to thane. No, it is different the heavens are closed to me. She may bless your way. No I can not. I do not want. Please. I can not bear load so sad and cold. Please. Take it. OK, but you need to win back their favor. We need our healing. Thane made his decision. You took yours. It's done. I'm sure your goddess has nothing. You feel like you whine and feel guilty now. You chose to love. And now you're here working to save thane for love. That is brave and noble. And any diosa_decente know. Love, strangely you speak so highly of him. I seem so callous? You have never taken seriously Dagen affection for you. Purio have business with the captain.

Where is it? Wait, eel is my friend. To share the secrets of their wanderings to require accounts. If I give you to the eel, he cut me out of the supply chain. Please, Captain. You kill me? Morire plague anyway. If the worms do not kill me first. I need to find eel. It is the key to saving a dear friend. He makes a sweet girl like you working with a slug like betylla? Please. The truth is I have not heard of eel. Is a moon, at least. But you might know where he is. Get close. Eel is in love with a whore called yuliya. Which is in the brothel rose travelers. Onken just outside the south eastern mines. If the eel is hiding from the world. That's where it is. Thank you. Leave it alone. Bastard. What 've you done? No witnesses. I'll kill you. Take off.

Know what you want and go in search, No doubt. That's unique. I not always know what I want. I can not. I want. But I can not. Good morning dear. How did you sleep? I know. We act as if nothing had happened last night. Of course nothing happened last night. Was nothing. I am sorry. You feel that? To have something that could ruin our friendship. Any chance that something better happen in the future? Thank you. Dagen. You really are a perfect gentleman. Not a perfect gentleman. Something is better than nothing, that's all. What? It must be this. The Rose. I have better frequented. I have frequented worse. Battle soldiers can make it worse. Get your hands up. Wait outside.

You owe Peragus guild Mallister five loadings best ilistrium. Where are they? It 's a funny story, actually. Where? ! Quiet, Betilla. Mine was confiscated by soldiers golgosianos. You lie. I'm not sorry. He was caught only because they know that mine is better. And they should be contributing to this. If you do not have and can not get it. Then you are not of any use to the guild. I can get it! I can get it. As? The golgosianos have a mine and a whole shipment. Worth at least three stones. And where it is, I can get it. Will you take us up there. Yuliya! Alton! Goodbye my love! It was lovely to meet you. Come on. Do not ever betray us like that again. Hare whatever it takes, marek. I'm surprised you do not do the same. You see? This is full of them. And what do golgosiano so far from your country? They have discovered the power of voluntary slavery. They dominate all this themselves. It is running out very fast and very deep. There will be an explosion if the demons of the caverns not reach them first. Then you better start. You see that ridge over there? It is where the cargo shed. Who is he? The man in charge. His name is tokora. I do not think golgosiano. I should not have come this far. I am looking me. Just calm down. What happened? I am looking me. Who you looking for? You are scaring me. You know I'm here. You're talking about the man with the cape? He is not even looking this way. He got into his tent. Tokora. Golgosiano signifies dark art. What's going on? Is Sherlock. Can not be. Because the ilistrium you mind? It is not what is here. The h. There is the ilistrium we talked about? That's not even know that pyre worth a fortune? What? We have to go. Marek think is right. You are here by dark seed. My only concern is the cargo. It is the only thing that saved her precious Armgo. Whether. The cargo is what matters most. It is a good day for you, fighter. I received another Betilla beetles. I guess I can not get you killed by one more day. I'm disappointed in you, thane. I thought I 'd better meat. Speaks! She Loves Me. And there is nothing you can do about it. Oh, gods! I'm having fun before you put a finger on. That's something you never know. Never tell your enemy what you value most. It is after this tunnel. Now is our chance. He can not have gone far. It is not here where you left off? It's here. What are we looking for exactly? A brown bag that big. Separate yourself. Do what he says. Is the now. Watch out. Demons cave. Golgosianos. I told you. That was a stupid move. Marek, go! You have to save thane! Do not. Do not! It's stupid, it runs! We can not just keep spinning. There must be another way out. Il istrium. Its beautiful. It is so pure. By the gods, that's nice! As they assume that worth? I knew it. What? What's up? Your precious mold. It comes all from a more corrupt source. The dark seed. That thing? The source of all ilistrium? It is an evil thing with a dark purpose. I have it. You could build an empire. It was supposed to be lost forever in this mine. But the darkness will eventually come to light. It 'll take to go pyo jun. The hides or destroy it. Do you know who I am. You know what I'm looking. You never will have the dark seed. The gods will take care of you fail. You choses them? Gods can do to stop me. When I have viday power over death? I'm not afraid of dying. This amuses me. Those willing to die, even marek. Although eventually it will be the cause of your own destruction. You know this is true. And still you can not help but serve their purpose. She never. It will help you. But it has already done. And he brought me two pieces of the heart of Amakna. And surely I will bring the third. You can not escape your destiny. She can not escape me. I never thought it would end like this. Too young to die. I'm still in my 70s. I am sorry. This was not your fault, Nor your fight. Please, come on. You know me better than that. I'm here for the money. For loot. If I know better that. Marek came by. My strength is my weakness. M and star. Efl is gtn iii and w e a k e s s KJ1. M and sti'length is diy wiki. M and s t r.

Thank you. FIUBA. Thane! Bastard! Then you come to face as you know you would. Liberate my friends. Free them yourself. They are surrounded by enemies. They are surrounded. Surrounded. Surrounded by enemies. Unleash your power over him. It takes its life force. It takes its life force and free your friends. There is no other way. Liberate your friends. I will give the dark seed, just let them go. The piece is mine for the taking. Take what you want most. Take your place next to me. Take your place next to me. See suffering? And you can save them, marek. I'm nothing like you. I'm not a killer. No, you're not like me. You do not look like anything to me, insolent NiRia. Now you must suffer the fate of all who defy me. Take my life and use it. Dagen saves. Not, Teela. I give my life freely. It is a sacrifice freely. This well take it. Do not. I will not do it. It's okay. Goddess! Give me your glory. Goddess.

You can walk? Good girl. Come on. I need to walk. Go Go. Okay, okay. Okay, together. List? Is good. Awake. Come on! I did not receive my beetle today. I think that means that your friends are dead. Why not talk loud? I'll kill you! Yes, I think you would. Is why we must die, fighter. Let it go. At good Time. Mens! Where is she? We talk about that when we're out of here, my friend. Unfortunately. Not let anyone leave here. I'll kill thane and then I'll kill you both. Terminense! Where is Teela? It is difficult, my friend. She is wounded? I am sorry. I'm so sorry. Teela sacrificed himself to save, thane. To save you. You were right. I should not go. I know where lies the fourth piece. Sherlock has no way to find it. So we see, we fight if it comes to that. Until then. You prepare. You packed light. It is a long journey. Which is the plan sherlock then? He is a mortal man. Breathe, corne, sleeping. If breathing.
