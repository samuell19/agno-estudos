(majestic music) (light music) - [Louise] In childhood there's always one year that changes your life forever. For me, it was the year from one Christmas to the next. I lived on a tiny Chesapeake Island with my twin sister Caroline. Caroline always got what she wanted and I hated her for it. (light jazz music) (seagulls squawking) (radio buzzing) (light jazz music) - [Announcer] We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin. The Japanese have destroyed the American fleet at Pearl Harbor. I repeat the Japanese have bombed Pearl Harbor. President Roosevelt is expected to declare war. (exciting music) (shoes clomping) - Caroline! Caroline! Caroline! Caroline, the Japanese have bombed Pearl Harbor. - Oh please. - It's true, I heard it on the radio. - It's Sunday. We don't play the radio on Sunday. - Oh fine, the whole world's at war and I'm the only one who cares. - If we are at war, it's a terrible thing, but we have a president and I'm sure he'll know what to do. - Well, I know what I'm going to do. - What? - Volunteer. Leave this Island and help people in need all over the world. - Oh Wheeze, nobody needs you. And you're not gonna leave this island. You're just not. (light music) - We're all gonna have to sacrifice, but President Roosevelt says it's important to keep up morale. - Easy for him. He don't have to work with you. - So I've decided what we need is some humor. And since humor is your weak spot, I'm here to improve it. - Ah huh. - Why do radio announcers have tiny hands? - How should I know. - We pause for station identification. - Wee paws, (laughing) tiny hands. (bucket clattering) - You ain't never seen no radio announcer. They're all the way to Baltimore. - No see it's a joke. - And besides, my grandma says, you can't either trust. - Call, it's a play on words. - She says, President Roosevelt's got them wrapped around his little pinky finger. - Call. (boat horn blasting) (exciting music) - Wheeze no. Wheeze. Wheeze! Slow down. (bucket clattering) Wheeze. Ain't never seen someone favor a ferry like you. - I'll be on it someday. - And for thy merciful bounty in thy name's sake, we thank the lord. - Amen. - Mr. Rice says our theme this year is peace on earth. - That's a fitting choice. - They shall beat their swords into plow shares. - But everyone's bombing everyone. - You singing "The Holy Night" again? - No grandma, Betty Jean Boyd's doing it. - Why's that? She can't half sing like you can. - Well-- - Because Mr. Rice wants Caroline sing something special. Captain Billy says a war'll start the crab prices down. - It'll be a scarce winter. - We could save some if you took me on as your hand. - You know I can't. - Dooey Parker's hiring on with his daddy. - (scoffing) Dooey's a boy. I'm threw mama. - You can't leave food, it's unpatriotic. - Mr. Rice says, I have a rare musical gift. He said, if I continue my voice lessons, I have every chance of being known. So, since I'm gonna be famous I've decided to write the story of my life starting from the very moment of my birth. Tell it mama. - But you've heard it so many times. - At least a hundred thousands so there's no reason-- - Twins, Louise came first just like Esau in the Bible, all red and hairy. (Caroline laughing) - I was not. - Then Caroline. Like Jacob, grabbing after Esau's heel. - Was I mama, was I grabbing Wheeze's heel? - You was too weak. Couldn't neither breathe, and cold. Midwife put you in a stove pot, warmed you at the oven. - I'm still very delicate. - Heat come up, fixed you right smart. - And where was Wheeze? - Sarah Louise. - You never gave us a moments worry. - I was asleep. While everyone was working on Caroline, I was left alone in the basket. Right Grandma? - How should I know. It was a long time ago. ♪ Repeat the sounding joy ♪ ♪ Repeat the sounding joy ♪ - Valachi, valachi. ♪ Repeat, repeat ♪ ♪ The sounding joy ♪ - Bravo. (students chattering) Yes, Louise? - Mr. Rice, I'd like to make a proposal. - Yes? - Sir, I feel it is wrong that we so selfishly celebrate while around the world thousands are suffering and dying. - Your proposal Louise? - I believe we should cancel Christmas.

You give all your crabbing money to your mama and she gives it for Caroline's music lessons. - Well, I'll just have to work harder. - If I get up any earlier, I'll meet myself going to bed. - I'm going to work twice as hard and save every extra dime. And when I have enough, I'm going to get on that ferry and leave this island, forever. (Call sniffing) (light music) (faint singing) Hello Auntie Braxton. - It's god's light sings through her. ♪ Amen ♪ (door clicking) (buckets rattling) - $2 and 45 cents. - Well, you've had a right smart haul. (paper crinkling) - Mercy Wheeze, you stink like a crap shandy. (door squeaking) - Well, maybe you ought to be grateful. (door slamming) - Why? - Because that stink pays for your music lessons. - It does not. I have a scholarship. - What about all the ferry trips? And what about all the taxi fares to Salisbury? - Daddy. - Well, I help. Every penny I bring in helps. You ought to be down on your knees thanking me for all I do for you. How dare you talk to me like that. How dare you! - Louise. - Did I say anything wrong? - By the time you wash up, we'll be ready to eat. - I didn't say anything wrong.

God shall damn the haters to eternal night. (Louise gasping) (light clicking) (cart rattling) - Wheeze! Look mom, Wheeze is here. - Oh. There's more in the hold. - What's that? - It's a recording. - I can see that. What's it of? - La Boheme. - La what? - It's an opera. (bag thumping) There's a girl, Mimi, and she's loves herself, and they all go to this pub in the day, and there's a parade, and then she realizes that she's in love with a poet. And the both poor and he's an artist in Paris. And then there's a big fight and resentment with Mimi's best friend, realizes that she loves Rodolfo. (boots stomping) - He's Hiram Wallace. - Who's that grandma? - Hope of every young girl's heart. And Trudy Braxton thought she had him. (laughing) But she was sore mistaken. - Old Auntie Braxton. - The old was young once. Don't you forget it. - Yes grandma. - His folks was rich. Even had a pasture. Real grass with cows. His daddy sent him off to school. But he come home before he supposed to. After that, wouldn't talk to nobody. Then came the storm. - What storm? - He and his daddy worked the bay. Their boat was the biggest. Mast reached 50 feet. Storm come up. So they dropped sail and waited. But not Hiram. He got scared. Feared the lightning would hit the mast. So he grabbed an ax and chopped it down. Town mocked him to his face, called him coward. A week later he was gone. Never come back, 'til now. - Well, he ain't here, so let's go. - Really Call, the slightest little thing and you're ready to scream and run away. - Oh excuse me. Didn't know I was in the company of a war hero. - Shh. (grass rustling) (pensive music) - Mission accomplished. No need to be scared, nobody's home. Now we can go. (window slamming) (Louise screaming) (ominous music) (Louise gasping) - You're under arrest. Unless of course you've come for tea. (bell tolling) This town has a genius for gossip so I, I guess you know who I am. Who are you? - My name's Sarah Louise Bradshaw. - My real name's McCall Pernell, but everyone calls me Call. - I see, so if I want you, I just call Call. - (laughing) Just call Call, you get it, Wheeze. - Wheeze, Call, sounds like vaudeville act. Course, much better would be wheeze and cough. - (laughing) Wheeze and cough. That's a riot, see Wheeze that's funny. - This place sure is a mess. Take forever to fix it up. - My age that'd be a problem. (Call laughing) - Ah, we could help. - Nope, I wouldn't ask. - Why not? - Well, I could pay. - Pay? - No, wouldn't ask. - Why not. - Ain't neighborly. - That's very generous, I accept. - Course, I can't be here. My grandma needs me. - And you're a girl. - I'm as strong as anyone. - Good, tomorrow, then 10 o'clock. And now grace. Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, Amen. (Call laughing) (light jazz music) (water splashing) (water splashing) (crabs clattering) Get your boxing gloves on huh, come on I'll take ya. - I'm supposed to be working. - Crabby just like you. You got a hard shell on, ready to fight. (hammer knocking) So, what's your plan? When you grow up. - I am grown up. - Oh. - My sister, Caroline's going to be an opera singer. (apple crunching) She's got the best voice in the whole state. She's going to be famous someday. Well, the whole Island loves her. - That so. - Yes that's so. - I guess you love her too huh. I asked about you, you talk about her. Well, do you, you know any good jokes? - Yeah. - Yeah? Tell me one. - Psychiatrist dies and goes to heaven. Saint Peter says, "You're a psychiatrist, stick around. "We might need you." Psychiatrist says, "Yeah why?" St. Peter says, "'Cause god thinks he's Franklin Roosevelt." (Louise giggling) (Hiram laughing) - God thinks his Franklin Roosevelt. That's good, that's very good. - I know. - Well, I gotta get home. Lots of work. Thank you. Been away a long time, nice to find a friend here. - Captain Wallace, see you tomorrow. 10 o'clock, your house.

And besides, it would ruin your manicure. (door clicking) (pensive music) (water splashing) - We cleared the jungle in Panama. Built the canal. Who'd of dreamed it? Warring sister oceans meet in peace. Don't bite your nails dear. Hands are the heart's messengers. - Yes sir. - You need any help? - No. - Emery board, rounds out the nail. Orange stick pushes back the cuticle, and lotion every day, a girl's best friend. - Otis has offered me pay Wheeze. I'd wait for you but-- - I'm not finished helping the captain. - But you've been working for him for weeks, for nothing. What about your money? What about school in Crisfield? - So hire on with Otis. - The thing is we won't be working here. My uncle fixed it. - Fixed what? - We'll be culling on a work boat out of Baltimore. I'm leaving here, Wheeze. (Call sighing) (buckets rattling) (opera music) (singing in a foreign language) - Isn't it thrilling? Someday, I'll sing like that. - Sounds like a sick chicken. - She's a woman in love and she can't tell him. She's tortured, she's confused. Ah, what would you know about romance? (needle scraping) You scratched it! Why do you always have to be like that? You ruin everything. You're going to end up just like grandma, old and bitter and alone. - It was an accident. (seagulls squawking) (Sandpaper scratching) - My daddy made this. It could do with some oil. (bottles clanking) (mysterious music) Captain Wallace, look. (ominous music) - This island's damn full of snoops. (trunk thumping) (hammer banging) (water trickling) I guess you heard the stories. - You're a coward, cut down your mast. - I cut it, but not out of fear. Out of anger and spite. I wanted to be a doctor. My father gave me that bag as a sign of faith. I was going to find a cure for typhus. God gave me two things: the love of healing and the fear of what I love. I wanted to be a doctor and I, I didn't think I was good enough. So I left school, came back here. God cursed me. So be it, I'd finish the job for him. Storm came, I, I cut the mast. Hurts when the soul's against itself. Shame, fear, hate, they poison a life. I was angry at the world. I only hurt myself. It took me 20 minutes to cut that mast down, 50 years to set it back. (wind whistling) (faint background singing) (piano music) (boots squelching) (oar scraping) - You can't come in here. - Can't I sing with you. - You don't know the words. (Caroline singing) - Stop it. Please stop it. (ominous music) (wood banging) (thunder clapping) (branch scraping) - Oh lord, come down and steal this evil wind. - Papa? - Storm's come up fast. I gotta go sink the boat. You best go down and get the captain and bring him up here. (wind howling) - Oh Jesus, you told the storm on Galilee. Peace, be still. - No mother Bradshaw. Be careful now Louise. Take the light. - The storm's his punishment for sinners. (ominous music) Oh no. (rain gushing) (thunder clapping) (bell tolling) - Captain! Captain! `- Louise! - Hurry, you've got to come to our house. - It's blowing me. (thunder cracking) No Louise! - It's a sign of fate. - Come on, come on. (light music) - Hey Whee, y'all make out all right? - Yes, sir, at least the house is all right. I gotta go check the captain's. (pensive music) (somber music) (bell ringing) (waves lapping) (wood thumping) - Well, that's that. (rocking chair creaking) We used to have cows. The whole marsh was a meadow back when I was a boy. - We heard it, yes. - Storm's a fearsome thing. - You're one ought to know. - It's not what you think. He studied to be a doctor. - I ain't a real doctor, but I did medic aboard ship. - Well, whatever tooked you from here, we're grateful in seeing you home. You best stay with us for a while. - I can't think what your daddy's up to, letting that heathen into our house. Into my bed. Ah my blessed, into my very bed.

Yeah, that right Louise? - Stop it, leave her alone. - She thinks he craves her, but I know who he's really after. I'll not have him in my house, much less my bed. That's what he craves, to get in my bed with me in it. - Mother Bradshaw. - Girls go to your room. She's old, got to make allowances. - He can't stay here. - There's no other place for him. - Yes, there is, he could live with Trudy Braxton. - That's ridiculous, people can't live together unless they're married. - Well then, that's just what they'll have to do. - If you mention it to him I'll kill you. - Oh Wheeze, it makes perfect sense. She needs somebody to take care of her. She hasn't been well. He needs a place to live in. Besides, they used to be sweethearts. It's the last chance. - (scoffing) I know he'll never agree to it. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. (horns honking) - Congratulations. - Congratulations. - Mr. And Mrs. Wallace. - Congratulations. (light music) - Mrs. Bradshaw, I got wonderful news. It's Trudy's idea really, and I agree wholeheartedly. Her folks left a small legacy and I've investigated. It's enough to send Caroline to music school in Baltimore. Nothing would make Trudy happier than that. - Well, I don't know. - Call could look after her. It's not that far away. Please, we want to feel we made a difference here. - I think I'll fix some tea. (shoes thumping) (door slamming) - Your sister stole the blessing. Romans 9:13, as it is written, "Jacob, have I loved." - Don't grandma. - Who said it, Louise. Who said it? - I don't know. - God, god said it. "Jacob, have I loved and Esau have I hated." (lips smacking) - Wheeze, please don't mind. It means so much to me.

I don't understand it. You were smart. You went to college. Why did you ever come to this god forsaken place? - I had some notion I would find myself here. - Well, did you, find yourself? - I found very quickly that there was nothing much to find. - That's sickening. You could have been anything you wanted to be. - I am what I wanted to be. I'm not ashamed of what I made of my life. I chose. - Well, you're not gonna make me like you are. - I can promise you I won't. I made my choice, you're free to make yours.

And so then when they grow, they get too big for it so they got to shed and they bust out. - Oh, busters. - Busters. And so then your female, she finds herself a jimmy and then they get married. - Now, those are your doublers. And then they go on a nice long honeymoon. And then she swims down the bay and waits for eggs to hatch. Well, you know what I mean. - You really love the water don't you? (lively music) - You've been a needed help to me, Louise. I thank you. (engine rumbling) (wood scraping) - Old Trudy died. - Yes grandma. - I ain't seen that old heathen about. Guess he's dead too. - Nope, Captain Wallace is just fine. - He don't come round no more. - Thought you didn't like him. - Thinks he's too good for a girl whose daddy don't own his own boat. There's ones would have had him. Coward or no. By the time I was 13, I was the prettiest thing on the Island. But he was already gone. I waited two more years, but he never come back. He was too old for me then. But I would've growed. - Grandma. - Oh my blessed, I would've growed. (light piano music) (seagulls squawking) - Call! - I joined the service. Come back to say goodbye.

And what's Miss Caroline got to say for herself these days? - She said, "Yes." - Yes to what? - Well let's just say she answered her Call. (Captain laughing) - Guess it took you most of the trip down to work that one out. She's only 16. - 17 in January. I said we can wait but she didn't want to. - What about her music? - She can go on ahead. I mean, I could help. I could-- - Give her a safe harbor. - You? - You never did think I was much to brag about now did you?

(hand slapping) (ominous music) (wood smashing) (bell tolling) (choir singing) Why did you choose her? Why? - Caroline was prepared for something. Chance came, she took it. - But I wanted to leave here. - You couldn't leave, you were too full of hate. You would've taken it with you wherever you went. - But I don't hate her. I don't even have that anymore. I have nothing. - That's so much lazy rubbish. You wanna believe you lost the race so you could spend the rest of your life complaining. - I've had two minutes of happiness in my life, and those were the two minutes before she was born. - Put your head to the wind, Sarah Louise, find out who you are, apart from your miserable jealousy. Find the one gift that's yours. 'Cause that's a sign of god in you. (solemn music) (Louise crying) - God hates me. - Poppycock.
