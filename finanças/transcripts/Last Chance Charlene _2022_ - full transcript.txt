Gyms closed, you know? - Done. - -All right, let's take five. Is there coffee today? Yeah, crafty got it right this time. Is there a restroom I could use? Hello? Hey, this is Raul, my personal cell. If you know me, leave a message. Clients, please use my office line. Hey, uh, can I come by your sister's house? I wanna see the girls. I could bring Froyo. Uh, I'll text you. Um... -Charlene? -Yeah-- Charlene! I haven't seen you in like so many minutes. I'm sorry, I don't-- Oh, I got my nose done and now no one recognizes me. Ugh. Cleopatra? We had acting class for years together. I see you in auditions. Oh, Cleo, oh, my God! Hi. It's Cleopatra now. It's on my headshot like all my socials, so... Oh. -I thought you were in New York. -I was. Well, I am. I'm just like taking a break. It's, like, the pandemic hit and it was, like, so dead. Like, New York died again. But I'll go back. You know, when it bounces back. But L.A., Vancouver, Atlanta is really poppin' right now. Oh, yeah. Totally. Did you just go in for this gig? How'd it go? Um, good. Um... Well, my manager said I was like a shoo-in. M'kay. I'm gonna get back to my phone call. - Oh, okay. I'll wait. -Um... -Do you smell that? It's like someone's lactating in here. Sorry about that. I ran into an old acting classmate. You got dinner plans? I'm gonna meet up with Neo and Dino. -Remember those guys from class? -Oh, mm-hmm. Yep. -Uh, I'm still on the phone, so, yeah. -Oh. We're gonna get drinks, chips and dips. It's gonna be so fun! I'm on my way, ASAP. I don't know. Um... Uh, okay. No worries if you're busy. Cool, cool, cool. Well, uh... I heard they needed a size 2, so... -I better get in there. -Mm. Oh, and hey, I... I'm sorry about your loss. I heard about Dominick. Okay? I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the memorial. - Oh. Well, thank you. - I just-- I got booked this amazing pilot at the same time as his Zoom funeral thingy, and-- God, I was, like, filming in Vancouver-- a sci-fi show. Had me in the chair for three hours every morning. Thank God because my nose was still healing. But, God, those COVID tests were a bitch. Anyway, so, it got picked up for a series! Can you believe it? W-- I hadn't-- Wow, congratulations! -You didn't audition? -I hadn't heard-- uh... I did, yeah. Well, you know, it's like I auditioned once and then I got a callback and booked at the same time. -Crazy! -Mm-hmm. Okay, I'm gonna go find a bathroom, so... Oh. Well-- okay, well, who's on the-- uh? But I'll see you tonight, then. So adorable. Ugh. Charlene? Charlene Tushy? It's me, Joan. Tucci. Oh. I never say it right. I haven't seen you at church lately. Haven't been in years. You okay? Poor thing. I've been praying for you and your mother. How is Lorenna? I miss her working at the church office. Joan, you'll have to excuse me. I have an emergency. It must have been so awful. I don't know what I'd do if a loved one committed suicide. -God forbid. -He didn't commit a crime. I dropped off a grief basket with cookies to your mom. -Do you know if she got them? -Not sure. Oh, she didn't send a thank-you note or anything. She hasn't been to women's group in a while and the ladies are talking. She may have had other things on her mind, Joan. Since my brother died. So, yeah. I'm gonna go before I urinate all over this parking lot. Unless you'd like to talk in a puddle of my pee? -Oh. I'll pray for you! -Don't bother! Oh! Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

Ugh. -I've been in a funk, Veronica. -I know. And you'll get healed by going to counseling, not a drive thru. But damn, why can't Hollywood normalize all body types? Means we need to work harder. Hey, what's your mantra? Say it. The story lies within me. Come on. Those are your words. The story lies within me. Mm. Go find that story, girl. If you're gonna be an actor/writer, you need to hustle! Get some sleep or your eyes will be as saggy as your abs. Veronica! So low. Jeez. Oh, and I got you a pitch meeting in person. Deets in your inbox and don't be late. No more of those-- I would say working on that film was, I don't know, cathartic for my soul. All right, so we're at the wrap party, right, and Alex, the producer, comes up to me and says, uh, "If you don't get an Emmy nomination for this or at least one of these MTV award thingies, I will personally, personally protest." I've worked with him twice already. -He's solid. -Mm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Alex's pronouns are actually she/her/hers. -All right. -So... my turn. Big news. -Neo, we rehearsed this. -Huh? Oh! Sorry, babe. -It's a drum roll. -Mm. Hand it out, babe. My fingers are hurting. I sold my second pilot this week. Oh! What? Yo, that's amazing! Thank you! Cleo, are you in need of a good-looking actor, late 20s, early 30s, who can also play a teenager once, you know, clean-shaven? - That's not all. - Mm-hmm. We just... Bought a house! Three bedrooms... Two and a half baths. All right, my parents helped with the down payment, so it wasn't all us. I'm not rocking seven figures yet. Yeah, my parents wanted to help, but-- -You'll hold your own end, bae. -They're poor. Must feel so good to get out of the rental market. Oh, no! You still rent? Oh, and with the kids? No bueno. Just... Ugh, what a shame, Charlene. Boo! Shirt designing is not making ends meet? My brother designed them, I do marketing and comms. Hey, what about a condo? Can you afford one of those, you know, studio/condo things? I wish. But it's too small for us. Yeah, yeah, no, I meant, like, just for fun. You know, my condo's for while I'm filming in Canada. Yeah, yeah. I have a house here. And you're acting and writing? The hustle is all too real. And she's marketing, and a mom? Too much. Way too much. My therapist said, "Focus on one thing at a time and that's what brings you joy." But you act and write, too. - Hmm? - Oh, and... she's an influencer. -A real "thumb-stopper" this one. -Oh, okay. Everyone who's anyone in this industry is an influencer. Hey, blue check mark, baby. All right? We're talking brand deals, and next stop? - A podcast! - Oh! I'm just saying, thank God I'm not still waiting on tables. Can I get a re-- Cheers. Oh, Charlene, I saw your, uh, lipstick commercial. -It was kind of hot. -Oh, God. -Hmm. Oh, my God, I missed it. -Thanks. Nice! Was it national? -Regional. -Aw. Like public access? Non-union? Pays the bills. Hey, Char, what's going on with, uh, with your film? Still shoppin' it. -You know, uh, looking for a producer... -Mm-hmm. ...getting notes, rewriting... -It's your first feature, right? -Yeah, uh, Thoughts That Kill Us. -Things That Kill Us. -Things That Kill Us. Oh! Sounds like slashery and gory. Lot of oozy blood, huh? -I'm in. -Ah, it's a drama. That title's not gonna work at all. Ooh, do you need a good-looking, almost-30-year-old who can play a sexy, dramatic serial killer? Do you have funding yet? Not yet. Apparently, suicide is more palpable when... intertwined with a scavenger hunt, according to the execs. What about an animated scavenger hunt suicide musical? I would watch that movie. - Right? - I-I wouldn't, so... Like a Dear Evan Hanson meets Finding Nemo mixed with Jungle Cruise. -Like a threesome. -Yes! And toss in some sci-fi. You know, some of that Star Wars meets Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. -Yes! Just total genre orgy. Just throw it all in. -Mm-hmm. -Yeah. -Right? Hm! I booked a gig today. -I need to use the restroom. -Damn! You on fire. - Damn! Pinch it. - What's this for? Okay, so this is organic, cruelty-free boutique in San Francisco. Excuse me. You okay? I'm... I'm not okay. You need help? I'll call for help. No, no, no. Please no. Oh, bitch. Is it cramps? 'Cause damn. I have edibles if you want. I'm just really tired, and... traumatized and sometimes peeing triggers me. -Yikes. -No big deal. A chocolate high might help. Why not? That'll be 25 bucks. -Each. -Each?! Mm-hmm. Uh, how about a twofer? Mm-mm. BOGO? I take cash or Venmo. -Eat it. Eat it! -No! -Stop! -Why?

You're not getting in my pants. -Oh. -Just so you know. My God. Uh, no. What, am I too old for you? Aren't you, like, what, 30-something? Don't remind me. When a woman turns 40 in this business, she's done. Mmm. SAG rules, yo. I live by them on set and in real life. You know just-- Just keep it a playable age range. Besides, you can-- You can lie about it on IMDb anyway, so don't worry. And, uh... No, I am not at all interested in getting in your pants. If I was, ooh! -Oh, you would know it. -Jeez! You could've at least pretended! - You know, use your actory skills... ...and blew smoke up my ass, and then let me down gently. -Jeez. -All right, okay, w-wait. That's not... what I meant at all. It's just, you know, #MeToo. And I'm all about consent. One hundo P! Besides, aren't you-- Aren't you married? I'm not about to holler at somebody else's lady, so... So you're a gentleman? - Three left. Two for me, one for you? How many have you had? Mm, three? Four? Seven? Don't know. That's a lot of chocolate. I'm floating. Feels good. Everyone deserves to feel good. I haven't felt... anything in a long time. -'Cause of your brother? -Dominick. Can I ask what happened? He died. Yeah, I mean, I-I know. And you know, I am so sorry. So am I. But, like, what happened, you know? Did your parents name you after the dog from The Flintstones? -What? -Your name. It always makes me hear that dog's bark in my head. I... I have no idea what you're talking about. Oh, my God. Can you hurry? I have to pee. Oh, are you that blazed? I can't believe you don't know. -Fred. Wilma. Pebbles? -Pebbles? -Who are you talking about? -How old are you? -Come on! -It's my little secret. They're, like, a prehistoric family. Like Jurassic Park but a cartoon. Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah! You know, my-- My mom loved that old-timey animated show, yeah! You know, she said-- She said if they do like a live show of it, I should play Barney or, uh, Kazoo. Those were the other names on her list for me. Elizabeth Banks is doing, producing, an adult cartoon. Yeah! You-- Do you do voice-overs? Oh, one hundo P! You're welcome! Yeah, I should call my manager, see if they're auditioning for that. - Your mom named you after a brontosaurus. - -Oh, my... -A little, purple yappy dinosaur dog. -Mm-hmm. What does it sound like again? Like that. Just like that. Oh, that's great. -You sure you don't want one? -Mm, no. You should have all of them. Uh. -I can do this. -Uh-huh. Um, no, no, no, no, n-no! What is wrong with you? Want me to come in? No, no. You stay here. -Stay right here, okay? -Mm-hmm. And don't eat my brownies! - Oh! Yo. Oh, my God! Are you okay? I'm good! I think I broke a couple toes and I peed a little, but I'm fine. It's cool. Popped two kids out of this vag. Oh! 'Kay. Didn't need that visual, Charlene. Got it! Got it. All right. Ayla? Ayla! - My precious. - Yes! Ayla, it's me! Don't shoot. Don't shoot. -I have to pee. -What the hell, Charlene? Sorry, sorry. I... Pee is dribbling down my leg. -Gross, Charlene. -Sorry. Thanks for the leggings. Hmm? That tree is giving me dirty looks. What's happening with you? -Do you hate me? -Are you pregnant? No. No! -God, no. -You need to see a specialist about those bladder issues. That... and I'm really high. Excuse me, what? You? Brownies. If I wasn't with child, I'd join you. -I think I ate 'em all anyway. -All? Is that bad? Could that kill me? That'll get you good. Shit. Um, are you okay? -No. -You're not? I mean, I don't expect you to be, but I... I wanna talk. I've been weird. Weird-- You have been weirder than usual, Char. -I miss you. -Really? Haven't been in a good place. Who is, Charlene? It's been hell. I don't believe in hell like I used to. Like, it's not a place we go when we die. It's life on Earth. We're all just living different versions of hell. Am I a heretic now? Mom would say so. Charlene? I sprained my toe. Should we go to the ER? Could I get some... Oh, my God. Girl, you better not piddle on my couch. - What the hell? Who is it? - Dino. Who? Dino. Like the, uh, little brontosaurus dog from the Jurassic Park cartoon. Who? I'm, uh, I'm Charlene's old friend from acting class. W-What do you want? Um... Is Charlene coming back out, or... Hi. Okay, so-- So what you're telling me is that the female duck, she has a-- she has a maze in her uterus? - Yeah. - -Wait, do ducks have uteruses, or-- - I don't know, I work with humans! Wow! That's just... It's all business, then, down there, huh? - All business. - Corkscrew. - With a spur on it. - Oh! What? - Mm-hmm! - Mm-mm. -Just business, no pleasure. -All business, no pleasure. I have delivered a baby once. As a doctor, of course, on that streaming show Hot DRs. You mean Hot Doctors? Oh, is that how you say it? I never knew. Mm, so you've watched? - Is it like-- is it like real life? No! There's not much time for sex in the closet in the ER. Hmm. - Sugar? - No. I try to eat clean as much as I can. Gotta take my shirt off a lot on camera, so, you know. Mm-hmm. Oh, hey! Good morning, you little ray o' sunshine, you! Hungry? Dino made breakfast. Mm. English muffins, wheat toast. Butter or dry? - Coffee's in the pot. - Pot. How are you feeling? - Sucky. - How's your toesies? Fine. Uh, why are you here? 'Cause you left him out in the car last night. -Sorry. Oh, you slept over? -We didn't sleep. We were up talking all night. Why are you wearing my brother's shirt? Oh, yeah! Yeah, I got the jeans on too. His stuff is really cool. What? No. -Okay, this is weird. -Charlene. It's fine. He needed some fresh clothes. I, uh, have an audition this afternoon. I-- I have a headache. I need some aspirin. You know where it's at. Help yourself. Grab a toothbrush while you're at it. One. This ain't Costco, brownie breath. That girl. -She'll be taking all the toothbrushes. -All my toothbrushes. -You know they're in the bag. -She's about to fill it up. Hey, buddy! I can't make my way, these straits so dire. Mud and mire. Put through the fire. Liar. Life is like a tightrope wire. I'll do my best, liar. You are a mess. Char? What's going on here? Just purging, organizing things before the baby comes. Are you moving? I've asked you to come get this stuff for months. -So you're moving on. -Moving forward. There's a difference. Sure. Split hairs. You're the words person. You know they matter. You've been AWOL. We were in a pandemic. Your mother, Raul, the kids, they all made time. I'm not gonna apologize for working. -That's not what I'm saying. -Well, what are you saying? I just thought that we'd watch The Notebook and cry and... eat Froyo. Aw. So you watched it without me? It's so sad but so good. I didn't have a lot to give. After the funeral, I was done. Which was a damn video call. You can't possibly be okay. I'm not okay. And I'm trying to run TBD, trying to write this thing, trying to keep my acting career afloat, my marriage from dying, and my kids from being totally screwed up. So... -I don't know. -I'm sorry. For what? I can't expect you to grieve the same way I do. I shouldn't have. Well, how are you grieving? You really are something, Charlene. Honestly. I'm asking because I don't know if I am... or how to. I can't tell you how. Everyone does it different. You just have to... to make time to do it. Get a grief journal. When... my dad died, you know, we had the whole church funeral and my mom did all the things. -It was a big deal. -Yeah. And my mom acted like his death was a blessing. "He's in a better place." Like Earth is bad and we should be happy he left us. "It's God's plan," and all that Bible bullshit. I was supposed to rejoice because "death is great," blah, blah. You didn't have permission to be sad. You sound like Raul. I watched that TED Talk he sent. You have no idea what it's like being married to a therapist. I could imagine it'd be a little annoying. My mom's different now about Dom. I know. And maybe it's a good thing. I think she's angry but won't admit it. So am I. Sometimes I talk to him... his ashes; sleep with them. I don't know. Sometimes it helps me. You talk to the urn? Back off. My therapist says it's normal. Is it normal to sleep with it? I-I'm not judging. Okay? I sleep with my laptop, so-- Oh, mm-hmm. Um, do you talk to a therapist in person or is it one of those weird, like, online text-to-help sort of things? -Ugh, come on, Charlene. -All I'd be able to think about is it is some weird dude, naked in his mom's basement, like texting while he's touching himself, like, "How do you feel about that?" That would make such a good scene. -Where are my notebooks? -Knock, knock, knock! Y chromosome approaching. You know, 'cause I'm a guy. - Uh-huh. - Anyway, um, should I Uber or can you take me? -I can. -Awesome. - Ooh, can I take some of those shirts too? -Help yourself. -Fo' sho'! Oh, God, I-- Ugh, I just ate. Really? Oh! Rude. What's, uh-- What's up with the guinea pig? His name is Orzo. -It's pasta. -Oh. Orzo. My brother was obsessed with Italy. Does he, uh, does he have a buddy? Pesto. - He died a few months back. - Aw. Damn. That's hella sad. As if I didn't have enough depressing things in my life. You're gonna get him another to bond with? They can die of loneliness, you know. Hey. I used to host an animal show for kids. Orzo. Okay. Ooh, okay! Idea. So I know that a lot of screenwriters will bring a prop to make their pitch more memorable. You know, stand out? Well... I can come. You know, act stuff out as you talk. I, uh, I used to mime in the park before I broke in, and I always win at charades, so, you know... -Yeah, nobody does that. -Really? Hey, are those your kids? Oh, they're cute. Thanks for last night. You and me didn't hook up, you know that, right? Yeah, I know that! Gah! -I wasn't that high! -Psh. Those brownies? Please. Just... thanks for what you did. Aw! You're welcome! Ugh. Ayla and I didn't hook up either. -Gross. Stop! -Okay, fine. Cool. Cool. But Ayla, though, yeah, she's-- She's badass. Ew, no! -Don't even think about it. Ugh! -What am I thinking? -Stop! -Okay, I'm just saying. Just... ...but I'll do my best to protest this mess, with the few ounces of dignity I have left. Hey! Are you a screenwriter? -Mm-hmm. -Wow! - You can't change me. And I can't change you. But I'll do my best to pick up this mess - with the few ounces of dignity I have left. ♪ I'd tear through the city Call out for you ♪ ♪ At midnight in pouring rain ♪ ♪ It's cold and gritty Did you believe ♪ -♪ I could brave through This certain pain ♪ -Bugs. ♪ I'm out here Tightrope walking ♪ Charlene? Hey, I've been waiting here for almost an hour. Are you sure they're expecting me? I confirmed it, yes. Just breathe and practice the pitch. Do you have an updated version of the script? Okay, okay. Uh, on a thumb drive I'm sure, uh, yes. I'm still waiting on your mom to sign off. And don't get too dark, keep it positive. -Don't be weird. -Veronica! -Do you want to sell it? -I wanna find the right producer. You might not have a choice. -I'll call you when I'm done. -You never call when you're done. I'll call you. The story lies in you. Are you ready? - No, I'm freaking out. - Did you go pee? Shit! Ugh. Charlene? Hi. Again. What are you doing here? Oh, you know, just trying to break into Hollywood. Well, don't get your hopes up. You know the odds are stacked against you, right? -Those damn odds, yep. -Oh. So you just left last night? I had to see my sister-in-law. She's really needy and I'm her backbone. Oh, well, when you can, Venmo me. We all split the bill; $75 dollars each. Includes tip. Oh, I didn't even eat anything.

Barely had a chance to eat lunch, so he's gonna eat while you pitch. Great. Great. What's with all the poetry? The main character is a poet. Cut it. It's too artsy-fartsy. It's a style thing. Hmm. Why does it have to be so dark? It's based on a true story. Hmm. And this is for you to star in? I wrote it to also act in, yes. Won't work. You're a nobody. I suggest a better "save the cat" moment in the first ten pages. We need to like him more. You can really lighten it up and have him trip down the stairs a couple times. Think Steve Martin. Maybe set it over the holidays. Christmas. Hmm. Mm. Have you seen The Family Stone? That's one of my favorites. Finally we agree on something. It's a holiday movie where somebody dies but we never see a dead body. Nobody wants to see movies about dead people. But there's lot of great movies about dead people. M. Night Shyamalan's "I see dead people--" Diane Keaton was standing at the top of the stairs smiling, then... ...a year later, "Where are the stockings?" People loved it. They made 92 mil on a budget of 18. And we never had to see an embalmed body, an open casket, or a funeral scene. Yuck. What are your recommendations? - Make it a rom-com. Streamers love those nowadays. And toss in a few minorities. You need some gays, people of color, disabled people! That's hot right now. Then get back to me. I'll talk with my team right away. -"Make it a rom-com." -Ms-- Ms. Tucci. Ms. Tucci. -Charlene. -I'm Trisha, Mr. Winter's assistant. - I am sorry to hear that. Hmm! - Exactly. I don't plan on assisting him forever. -What are you, an actor? -I wanna produce. Huh. Well, we need more of us. I liked your script. You read it? All of it? You like... everything? I... have some notes. But I got what you were going for. It's different. W-- I wish you were green-lighting it. Terry, T-Trisha, can you, uh, order me a fla-- -a flan, a "flanne," whatever? -Someday. You know, that custard that the Mexicans make. I said I'd call you! - So it went well? - No. He's a windbag slob who doesn't understand my vision. You have to be willing to make edits. And I will when I find the right partner, who wants to work with me. Not some crotchety, old douchebag who leeches off people. Charlene. Don't be ageist. Look, we need to get a spa day. -Or a yoga class. -Sorry, I can't hear. Bye. Hey, Charlene! Hey. -It's me. -Hi. -Hi. -Hi. Did you see Cleo up there? -Mm-hmm. -Yeah? She has a friend whose sister is married to one of the execs, so... Oh. Hey, we're going wine tasting in Napa later. Do you wanna join? Probably not, but thanks. You know, we've just been so stressed what with the house and all her work. It's just like... Neo, could you not do that? Oh, my goodness. I am so sorry. I am so lame. Come here. -Oh. Oh! Oh, it's okay. Thank you. Oh. -You're okay. -Okay, that's enough. -You're enough. You're enough. Thank you. Bae, hi! What's going on here? Did you get my coffees? I texted. Oh, no. I didn't see it. I'll be right back. Can I get you anything? Triple espresso? -A mocha java something? -I'm good. I still owe you for water, so. That's right, yeah. Venmo her. You need help. -Let me. -Excuse me? Charlene. I see you floundering like a dead dolphin in the waves. And I'm out here hanging ten in the surf, and I wanna pull you in. -You certainly have a way with words. -I know. So, first, I can punch up your script. Second, I can get it to the right people. -I appreciate that-- -Charlene. This business is against us. You agree, huh? You know how many times I've been asked by some slimy dude into his hotel room? And you don't deal with stuff like me. I have to talk like this for a commercial. How many times I've had a producer tell me to make my character more Mexican. I'm not even Latina! Like, I'm Middle Eastern. Well, ethnically ambiguous. Whatever. Anyway. All I'm saying is that I had to grab that bull by the balls and become the captain of my own ship. And you, you're just, um, you're like a broken bird with broken wings-- Okay, enough with the metaphors. Did you get any bites on your pitch? -Ah, bites? That's interesting-- -Look, can I be blunt? You kind of always are. -Who's your manager? -Veronica Ja-- Jackson. Mm. That little actor from our acting class? She was an actor. We were friends-- Well, you need more than friends in this industry. -You need partners. -What are you suggesting? Your reps, your brand, your whole ethos, i-it needs some help. So cut to me coming in, adding my magic. This feels like Pretty Woman. If you identify as a sex worker, more power to you. All I'm saying is that I can offer my connections, my luck, my influence. Do you have an attorney? -Uh-uh. Uh-uh. -Budget's tight. Who cares? We'll figure it out. Just give me your script and I'll work my magic Wonder Woman-style. All right. Oh, my God. - Okay, um-- - Charlene. -My people will call your people. -Okay, well, I-I'll text you. -Charlene-- -Here you go, babe. I wanted one iced and one hot. Babe! Oh, my God, this is unacceptable. Lord. I could get ice. Charlene! Oh, bye, Charlene! "I had no choice to be brought into this mud and mire, put through the fire." "Maybe it seems I'm better for it." -Hey. -Hey. How are you? Scale of one to ten, uh, how deep do you want my response to be? Five. Okay. Well, Sophie's having nightmares. Your mom gave her this, like, televangelist scarf. Said it had prayer power. Super weird, but of course she loves it. And, uh, Izzy's just... really stressed. She had a meltdown the other day while I was counseling on a video call, so... -Wait, you're still doing that? -Yeah. People still, uh... prefer that to meeting in person. No! No! Take a walk? -How are you feeling? Scale of one to ten. -Stop with the techniques. Char. Char! Charlene. Look, I'm trying to help you. -Feels like you're pushing me away. -Pushing... Pushing you? You stopped talking to me. Even when you were in the room, you weren't present. Or you were gone or... you were sleeping and the kids were late for school. My brother put a gun to his head, Raul. You asked me to leave. -I needed space. I-- -That's fine. But I wasn't gonna leave the kids with you. -'Cause I'm a bad mom? -I didn't say that. -We had to do what's best. -What's best is to not have their flailing mother around them. -That is not what this is. -What is it? Do you want a divorce? Do you? Look, I've supported you... while you pursued your dreams for ten years. You think I like living in the most expensive place in the planet when we could've gotten a house close to my parents? I just want you to acknowledge the toll that it's taking on us. Are you listening to me? Char? I feel like a shitty person for wanting to pursue my dreams. I don't know. Somehow it seems like I'm sacrificing you and the kids for it, but that's not it. Look, you lost your brother. And nothing in the world is gonna fix that pain. You don't get to do that. -What? -Make this about Dom. Oh, but you do? I mean, can't you see that-- that that's a part of this? Of what? Our marriage problems? -My failures? My-- -Trauma! It's connected. Mm-hmm. You can't run away from this. You know me. You know I'm... I'm just trying to help you. Sometimes your help... makes me feel bad about myself. I didn't realize that. It seems you're always right and I'm always wrong. - That's the story you tell yourself. You're gonna use his T-shirt slogans on me? I just wanna go back to the way it was before. You can't! You have to work your way through it. I don't know how. Be patient with yourself. I don't even know myself. I feel like a thousand shattered pieces. It takes time to put those pieces back together. -What if I get it wrong? -What if you get it right? Huh? I already screwed it up. Nobody's saying you only get one chance at this, Charlene. "Mud and mire... put through the fire. Maybe it seems I'm better for it. But I'll be damned I'm ashamed to admit sometimes I wonder... if it'd be better if I was never born." What do you think you could've done differently? Mom? Mom! Mom? Mom! Oh, Charlene, what are you doing here? I've been trying to call. I have no idea where my phone is. It's so dark. What are you, a vampire? Remember how you'd always bust my chops when you and Dom were kids? Oh, my God! You traumatized us. You called us vampires. "What do you want from me now? My blood?" "Get out of my hair, you little vampires. I've got nothing left." Yeah, yeah, parents always scar their children somehow. Seems like even when you're trying your best, you fail. Okay, I didn't come over here for another "poor you" talk. Just wait 'til Izzy and Sophie grow up. They're gonna hate you too. We never hated you. Ever. You just ruined our lives, so we resented you a little. How are the girls? Raul's supposed to bring them over this weekend. Sophie's okay, I think. Izzy, maybe not so much. You hungry? I made Nonna's pasta. -I got tea, water. -Mm. So long as you can control your bladder. How are the auditions coming? You know, I keep seeing that lip gloss commercial. Your lips look pretty good in that. Hmm. Your skin looks dry, honey. -Is that a whitehead? -Stop, Mom! Look, I need you to sign off so I can use you in my script. Oh, your film? Fancy. Standard practice. No big deal. I haven't even read it. I emailed that to you over a month ago. I don't do the email, Char. I need paper. I have an old version, but you'll get the gist. Did you print it on toilet paper? Enough with the bathroom jokes! Remember the time we were in traffic 'cause dad took us to see the holiday lights in that really nice neighborhood? Yeah. It was right after your Christmas dance recital, yeah. And we were stuck for like an hour and you kept wailing in the car -because you had to-- -Mom, I was nine! And I drank that big thermos of hot chocolate. I kept telling you I couldn't hold it. I always told you, Charlene, right before we left the house, "It's now or never, Charlene." "I'm not stopping so get it all out." What? Honey. Ugh, oh, God. I am a bad mother. I am so sorry, honey. I didn't think-- - I just-- I hated public bathrooms and-- - It's stupid, I know. It was always in some horrible gas station or supermarket or something. Mom, it's fine. Oh, yeah, hand me my rosary beads. In the basket. So... you've been carrying this-- this pee story... all these years? I've been carrying a lot, Mom. Your dad... was, you know, the big adventurer guy. The Mr. Go-with-the-flow. And I just-- I've never been good... at spontaneity. He was always the "you never know when you need--" "An extra roll of TP." Yeah. Did you ever regret having kids? Wait a minute, what...? -What-- What kind of question is that? -Answer it. I-- I... Kids are hard. They're expensive. Exhausting. But I loved you! Gifts from God. Grandparenting is a lot easier. -Hmm. -Honey, it's kinda normal for a parent to resent their kids sometimes. Just a little bit. I always thought you loved Dominick more than me. -Always praising him. The entrepreneur, socialite... -Honey! -No! -...the extrovert. -No, Charlene. No. -He could do no wrong. Dom was... special, you know? But so are you. Just both in your own ways. -Same shit every parent says. -Shh, watch your mouth. -Jesus is right there. -Jeez. I mean, is that necessary, Mom? Ayla fights me on it every time she's here. I love it. Charlene... I loved you, same as Dom. I tried. I did. Screwed you both up, huh? He always seemed so happy. Even when I knew he wasn't. -What if I could've done something? -Don't do that. You can't do that. "What-ifs" won't help. You didn't do anything wrong. It's not your fault. It's not my fault. Nobody's fault. Dom just... He did what he did. We will never ever understand why. Nobody's to blame here. Are you Good Will Hunting me right now? What does that even mean? Everything is always a movie scene to you. You need help. I thought when you married Raul, maybe you'd get free therapy. What's with the beads? Oh. My own little church service. Wait, so you're Catholic now? I thought you were Christian non-denom-- I'm what works for me. I saw the pastor's wife. Joan? Screw that witch. Sorry, Jesus. Wow. Ugh. They brought me a little sad kit. Oh, yeah! Grief basket. - Yeah. - I see. They keep calling and... bringing over casseroles... Made from a can! Don't eat anything! -It's been there for months. -Shit. Well, it was kind of nice of them. Ugh. Yeah. Pastor told me... He couldn't lie and say that Dom was in heaven. At his memorial. I worked there for 23 years. Supposed to be my friends. I'm sorry, Mom. Dad died, he gave me three days off. Secretary in a church. And I get three days. They're dead to me. Is that why you had me read Dominick's Eulogy? No. You read his eulogy because you wrote it. And you wrote it good, baby. -Wrote it well. -Oh. Ow. So violent with your god. Will you make me some more, uh, tea? Pack some of that pasta up. I'm gonna read this. -As long as you sign the contract. -Yeah, yeah. I miss your brother like crazy. But I didn't love him more than you, Charlene! You're above average, Mom. You're a pain in my butt. Language! Jesus is here. When's the last time you visited his grave? - Do we say plot? - Grave? Tombstone? I never know. Not since we put it in. Ayla's got his ashes, and she does her thing. I just sit here with God, talk to Dom whenever I want. Okay, so how does that work? You send Dom messages through Jesus? Like Holy Spirit texting? Mom? Mom? Oh, my God. No! Mom! Oh, my God! Charlene, what the heck? I'm sorry. I thought you were dead. You watch too many movies, Charlene. Charlene, so are you bargaining now? Mm. Hmm. Okay. Hmm. Mm. Thanks. Could you follow me on Instagram? Hey! What you doing here? I could ask you the same question. -Where's Ayla? -She's, uh, getting ready for work. Ooh. Smile. -This feels like an episode of Black Mirror. -Oh, yeah, yeah, check that out. - Hmm? - Ugh, get out of my way. Eat up. It's National Donut Day somewhere. Oh, you know, I, uh... -...played a chef in that Food Trucks series. -Of course you did, whatever. So you, uh... slept over here again? No. No, no, no. I left my clothes here the other night, so, you know, I just thought I would come by and, uh... I asked him to come over and make breakfast. Déjà vu, huh? -I need you to sign off on the script. -What if I don't want to? -I'll just change all the character names. -Oh, you should totally do that! Yeah, and what if-- what if you changed the main character's ethnicity? It's about your bro, right? A white guy? Go on. Dino has good ideas. You should listen. Okay, so check it. You're writing this story about your real life and, you know, trying to heat it up, right? Change it up. You know, people are always saying, "Representation matters, Hollywood needs more diversity." So what if Dominick was Deandre? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And-- And Ayla was, well-- -well, A-Ayla. -Obviously. Or-- Or Dominick-- plot twist-- Deanna. Yeah, yeah, yeah. -She and Ayla, you know-- As do I. -I like where this is going. And, you know, instead of trying to sell it and have some other person, most likely an old white dude, direct it... You do it. A female director! Ah! Yeah, I've never directed, so... Yeah, well, you know, what if this is your time? You've been acting forever. I'm sure you know exactly what it takes to be a good director. The same way that I know what it takes to be a good doctor -after being around some of the bad ones. -Mm-hmm. As I could tell you what makes a good actor playing a good doctor. Does this mean you'll sign off? Sure. Well, I gotta go to work. Gotta squeeze out a few more days before I squeeze out this little human. Hey. Psst! How about we stay and give birth to a baby, too? "Charlene's baby." -That's-- That's your script. -Yeah, I got that. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. You know, I could stay and, you know, pitch ideas. -I'm open. -Really? Ugh, fo' sho'! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's do this. You know, Cleo said she'd help, too. Can you feed Orzo? I'll be home by 9. Lock up if you leave. If? No! That face. Adaptation, Charlie Kaufman. Memento, Christopher Nolan. Royal Tenenbaums, Wes Anderson. Mm. Never heard of 'em. You're an actor. You may wanna watch some movies. Aren't you supposed to, like, I don't know, "show, not tell"? Isn't voice-over considered like really cliché? Some people say that, but if it's right for the story, -then it's right. -Ooh. I can't think of any. Fight Club? Oh! Okay! Yeah. Hell yeah! All right. We could write another Fight Club. You know the first rule, right? -Boom. -Nope. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait. What did I say? I can't do this with you. And not in that shirt. Well... -I really like this shirt. -I'm going for a walk. Like around the block or off a bridge? -Ugh! -Should I be worried, Charlene? Feed the damn guinea pig! Ooh! F... You--! God! Are you kidding me? "Oh, yeah, let's do Fight Club. Yeah." Shit, what are you doing? What are you doing? Okay, okay, okay. Right. Okay. Hey. Are you okay? No! Because that age-ambiguous, muscley, dumbass is moving in on your wife. He's wearing your clothes. And he thinks he knows how to tell me how to do my job. Typical man. And you, in the driver's seat now, this is all your fault. So you're angry? I can label my own feelings, thank you very much. What do you want? I am sick of explaining to people how you died! I don't want everyone's shame and judgment. I don't want any more cliché... clever slogans or Bible catchphrases. I'm tired... of failing at every part of my life. I wanna do something satisfying, you know? Make a difference in this stupid world without sacrificing me or my family for it. What do you need? I need to feel safe and free. I need to feel like I can do what I love without feeling like it's not good enough. And... I need to know I can do it. And I need to know if I fail that I'll be okay. Why do you think you don't deserve those things, Charlene? Number one, it's my story and my script. I write the cards. You can pitch ideas, but I get the final say and you're not getting your name on it. -Fine. -Fine? Really? That easy? -Can I have a role? -Maybe. -The lead? -No. Number two. Don't make jokes about killing yourself. It's rude, offensive, and triggering. And people should stop saying "commit suicide." Say "died by suicide." -It's death. -Yeah. You're totally right. You know, t-that's my bad. Number three. Keep your shirt on at all times. Done. One hundo P. -Thank you. -Can they be Tutto Bene shirts? I'd prefer you didn't, but I'm not gonna get all wound up about it. I mean, you do need to wind down just a little. Number four. Don't tell me what I need or what I should or shouldn't do, ever. Jeez. She's a fun one, isn't she, buddy? And number five... -We need more brownies. -Ooh, can Orzo come? Leave the pig! Oh, man! Sorry, buddy. Write what you know. Isn't that what you screenwriting people say? Yeah. I guess. That why you're writing about depressing stuff? -You're nosy. -I'm just asking. You know how many people ask me how Dominick died? Like, they want details. Like it's any of their business. And then when I tell them, they get... quiet or worse, say stupid shit. That's partly why I'm writing the film. Give people a way to talk about this because they suck at it. Write what you wanna see. Yeah. What would you write about if you could actually form adult sentences? Spicy! Um... -I got a lot of stories. -About? I'm brown. Take a guess. Hey, question. -Have you ever been high before? -Never before the brownie drugs. Yeah, they were weak in my opinion, but whatevs. They did something for me. I needed it. I-- I need something. Something... Something for... Shut up and stop asking so many questions. All right. Cool. I'll, um, I'll stop asking questions when you use a trash can! Damn, Charlene! -Good to see you again. -Thank you. Take care. Hey, hey, hi! Hey, hey, hi, hi! -Excuse me, Ms. Brownie Lady? -Excuse me. I need to talk to that waitress. Janay? -Whatever her name is. -Why? Because I need to! It's personal. -Boo, you better back up! -Whoa, whoa, okay. Hey, hey. Uh, let's play it cool. Because you're about to go viral for all the wrong reasons. - You do that. - Hey there. Look, I don't want any Karen trouble, okay? What? I'm Charlene. What? You want to expose me on social media? Get me arrested? Great. I'll be another Black person in the news. -No. What? -You deserve it. Please don't get me fired. -It's just been a shitty year enough. -No! What are you talking about? I'll Venmo your money back, okay? - No, I just want more of the "stuff." You want more? Yeah! Brownies with the, you know... The pot. -You don't know? -Know what? Oh, shit. Let me spill some tea for you. I punked yo' ass. -Excuse me? -They were fake. What? Oh, my... How could you do that? You and your perfect, little L.A. friends were giving me bad juju vibes. And the perfect, beautiful one? She never tips. She means Cleo. My girlfriend just broke up with me, and I saw you go in the bathroom, and heard whatever you were doing... And it just snowballed from there. And instantly, you were on the wrong end of the revenge plot that I concocted in my head. I'm in improv, so I'm just always "yes and-ing" in my head. Yeah. One hundo P. Wha-- Maybe they were just like a little bit real? They were regular ol' brownies made from a box. Wow. - So many empty calories. - Yeah. Sorry. I mean, I called it. St-- Want some to go? On the house. I can't even get high right. It's not funny. -I failed at doing drugs. -Oh. Uh, yeah. One hundo P. You're a loser when it comes to being a druggie, Charlene. I wasn't even high. Hey. What's up? -Ah! -Oh! Can I try? -Sure. Okay. -Yeah? Okay. You gonna do it with me? -Okay. -Okay. -Ooh! -Sorry. Ooh, that was nice. What's that? Um... When you're ready. Uh... Okay. Whenever you're ready-- Charlene. Oh, my God. Okay, okay. Whenever you're done doing whatever it is that you're doing, we need to chat about Cleo. -What? -Yeah. Phone. Come on. Sit-- Sit with me. Yeah, come on. -Wha... -Um... -What about her? -Okay, hear me out. If I was you, I-- I would get my script back from her. I mean, she's been more successful than I ever have, so-- Charlene. She's a hot actress who, uh... who loves Instagram likes more than doing real work. Wait, how do you know how hard she's worked, you know, or what she's been through as a woman? As a Persian woman who people think is Latina? -Yeah. -No, yeah. You're-- -That's right. -You're right. That's-- That's facts. My bad. I need a cannoli. A what? -Are you kidding me? -What? First the Flintstones... - How old are you? You tell me now. - SAG rules, yo. -God, I have to teach you everything? -What is the cannoli? -I don't know what you just said. -I'm gonna show you, man-child. Okay, that was unneeded. That's not a cannoli, that's a toilet paper roll. Grab that, I gotta pee. Let's go. You hit my lip! I don't know where that toilet paper's been. I do not know, though, how anyone can like these phallic-shaped creations. Leave the sarcasm. -Take the cannoli. -Okay. -Or you're dead to me. -Ooh, nice. -That's well delivered. -Ugh. - I like it. - It's terrible. - Cheers. - Hey. To eating our emotions. -And brownies. -Ah, yes. -Oh, stop it. -We can't forget that. It's so embarrassing. Oh. Our bodies have a way of speaking to us. It's scientific. What, so you're saying my body just wanted to get high? I'm saying you've been carrying a lot lately, just holding it together. Your mind just had a reason to let it all out. I played a corpse once on that Mystery L.A. show. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You know, and one of the episodes dealt with how we can sweat blood when we're so anxious or incite traumatic amnesia. Yeah. You know, the body is a complex, mysterious thing. - All right, simmer down, "Hot D R." Hey, uh, do you ever do anything just for you? My career. My writing. That's for me. Ah, no. I mean, like, video games, you know, ultimate frisbee, goat yoga. -You do that, don't you? -Yeah, definitely. -100%. -Why am I not surprised? -She used to dance. -Oh! "Used to." Didn't go anywhere. Okay, so-- So is that a white people thing? You know, like-- like raisins in the potato salad? Why does it have to go somewhere? Why can't it just be because you like it? Uh, I don't do that. That's gross. Okay, so... I guess I have to A, check my white ignorance, -B, watch more scientific TV... -Yes. - ...and C, loosen up. - Get high. Oh, yes. - Well-- All right, yeah. Mm-hmm. - Should I? For real this time. - For real, for real-- Yeah, not those brownies. Uh... Well, my body is telling me... -I need to go to sleep. -You can crash on the couch if you want to. Oh, one hundo P! - You don't have to keep running TBD. -Oh, and what, you will? We'll be okay. You were never that in to it, were you? -It was never my dream. -It wasn't mine either. I can't quit. -I want to, but I can't. -Why? 'Cause it would be like letting him go. "The story lies in you." Oh, my God, can I be honest? I never really liked that tagline. Same! The double meaning of "lies," I couldn't get past it. I just went his way, you know. His ideas. He was so... complicated. No one will ever be able to make me laugh like him. Depressed as hell, but the biggest smile. I hate it. Meds, therapy. It helped a little bit, but... Not enough. I'm sorry. Did you ever blame me? I blamed everyone. In some way. Come on. Shut the door. Hey, you're not into Dino, are you? He got me a new guinea pig. We named him Mac. -"Macaroni." -No, he didn't. But, oh, it's so cute! I'll take some joy however I can get it. Even if it comes in the form of a... random boy and smelly rodents. I thought you were a feminist. Feminism means I can live however I want. Nothing wrong with a little Dino-shaped surprise. This is getting weird. We're way past weird. When did Dom get the gun? I never knew he owned one. During the protests 'cause of the break-ins. Uh... The corner store was-- was trashed. It's Black-owned. I felt so disconnected with quarantine. We never talk about this stuff. -What stuff? -Racism. -Ayla! -What? That's not fair. Have you ever asked me what it's like to be a Black woman, a Black woman in a family of Christians with a white Jesus on the shelf? -Yeah. Okay. -Mm. Dom was always Mr. Woke, huh? Do you think I'm racist, Ayla? I'm not a racist. You know it's more than just saying it. I have brown children. Damn it. I knew as soon as it came out of my mouth. That was... It's work. We all have to do it. I don't need another reason to feel shitty. Sometimes you gotta feel shitty to change. Okay, so Dom got the gun... For protection. He was scared. We-- We both were. Three miscarriages in five years. Riots. Pandemic. His depression. - Your father's cancer. - God. This baby's my miracle. My hope. Can I talk to it? Want to feel it move? Touch my belly when I say you can -but never my hair. -I know... that. Here. Yep. Hey, little one. It's your Auntie Char. How are you doing in there? Rashida if it's a girl and Little Dom if it's a boy. Oh, it could be nonbinary. Oh, look who's woke now. Hey, you. I'm sorry you have to be born into this quirky family, but we will do... everything we can to be worthy of you and to make this world better for you. You are loved, okay? Don't forget it. Most of your life will-- will feel like that's not true, but we're gonna be here... to help you believe it. Your daddy... missed out on you. But we're gonna tell you about him.

Good, I think. I'm a screenwriter too. Not just a barista. Cool. So what's yours about? So, I'm currently writing this pilot about these teens with mystical powers living in a dystopian society. I'm thinking of-- So, uh, what's with the... From Ayla. Nice. -I like a chocolate Jesus. -Is it okay to say that? -I read your script. -And? It's good. It's okay. Needs work. Well, gee, Mom. Thanks. Just keep working on it, honey. I've been. For forever it feels like. I will. Did you really believe what you said? That there was nothing we could've done to help Dom? No. No. Most of the time, I don't. But I'll never know, right? So why even... Honey, you... Why did you quit dancing? Oh. -Huh? -You were so good. -Was I, though? -Yes! Honey, you loved it. It was fun. I wasn't winning any medals. After Dad died, it seemed like all you wanted was to go, go, go, and do, do. So driven. It was like you didn't have any time to just be you anymore. I don't see it like that. Okay. Okay. All right, I'll, uh, I'll sign off on your film or whatever it is you want me to do. One condition, though. Meryl Streep plays me. Well, I'm thinking of changing your character's gender and ethnicity. Ayla put you up to that? All right. Denzel Washington, then. Oh, no. Michael B. Jordan. -He is hot. -Mom! -Mm. -He is. Do you still cry? About Dom? Every day. I miss him so much. -I miss our text threads. -Oh, God. He never called. He'd only send those stupid moving glitchy things. -It's a gif. Graphic interface exchange format. -Whatever. I hated them. But I would do anything to get another one. Maybe we should start a new thread. Sometimes... all I wanna do is sleep. Other times scream. It's like a-- an endless acid trip. Ain't it? Grief cycles. God. Do you know about those? Raul's given me every book ever written. -Yeah, but you're not reading 'em. -Yeah. Pastor, jerk-face that he is-- sorry, Black Jesus-- wrote inside the cover of one of them books, "Death, where is your sting? Praise be to God." Like he has any clue. You know, sometimes the way people use the Bible really just burns my hide. -Five cycles of grief. -No, six. Sometimes seven. -What? -Yeah. Says so in one of those books. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. And finding meaning. Then... living with hope. So you spent some time... In-- In the sad kit, yeah. -I did. -"Grief basket." Who knows? Maybe it'll help. Maybe it already is. You're a beautiful person, Charlene. A child of God. I am blessed to be your mom. If you want, I'll do one of those text threads with you. If I can ever find my phone. Mm. Check the cushions. Oh, cut it out, Charlene. Just checkin'. Go, Izzy. It's okay. - Mommy! Mommy! - Do I have to? She isn't even in our life. Ooh! I missed you so much. Hi. -Tia Angela's farts smell worse than Dad's. -Oh. Ooh! Dad doesn't give me much screen time as you do. - And he's strugglin' with my hair. Little bit. When can we live together again? Soon, I hope. Oh, look! Huh? -For you. -Thanks, Mom. You're welcome. Bye, Iz. Love you. Daddy said you're getting better. -I'm trying. -How? Sometimes mommies and daddies need a little more than Band-Aids and hugs. Maybe Grandma's prayer scarf could help you, too. -Thanks. -Well, what was it what Uncle Dominick always says? The story is you? "The story lies..." Yeah, something like that. Hey, go find your sister. Izzy! Where's my Froyo? Kinda stress ate yours on my way. Like old times. -Izzy's not-- -She's not herself. She misses you. I know I've hurt you and the girls-- -Charlene, it's-- -No, let me finish. Please. Things... need to change. I'd like that. I don't know what or how or when. -I... -It's okay. It's not. I'm not okay, Raul. Neither am I. But, uh... Maybe we can be not okay together. Oh, um... who's Janay? And why did you, uh, Venmo her $250 for... Oof. ...plant fudge? Story for another day. I'm still waiting on the refund, so... "There's not much I expect you to do but to love and accept I am me and you are you. Lies wrangle? No. Lies rile within. We fight to live, to rise up in messy glory day by day." "We learn to be the story."

You saw it as helping me? Hell yeah. And helping myself. You think I wanna stay in that deadbeat acting class forever? But we're friends, too? Right? I thought we were. Are. Good. I want that. Yeah, it's okay. Okay, I need to hear the words "you forgive me." That's deep. I forgive you. Thank you. I'll be better. I'll be a better friend and client. Same.

God works in mysterious ways, Joan. I've been praying. I know you told me not to, but you can't stop a prayer warrior. -Don't give up on us, Joan. -What shall I pray for? Whatever God or the good Lord Black Jesus tells you to. Who's that? Just another person trying to help. You want me to run her over? Let me pray on that. - Black Jesus? Girl, we do need to talk more.
