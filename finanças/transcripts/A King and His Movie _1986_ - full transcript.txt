No. No. He'd never been in Araucanía nor in Patagonia. King Orélie Antoine de Tounens... ...had never left France before 1860. An adventurer, one might say? What would that mean? Well an obscure provincial public prosecutor... ...intoxicated by travel books... ...designs a flag and... ...manages to be crowned king of Araucanía and Patagonia. If you don't want to call him an adventurer... ...you'll have to call him an usurper. He didn't usurp anything. But that territory belonged to Argentina and Chile. Sorry... Do we have a map? It seems we don't have a map. We know for sure the indian chiefs of Patagonia... ...crowned him king. Just a second. There's the map. 30,000 indians swore allegiance... ...to his flag and constitution in December, 1860. He arrived there alone, without an army. He made only one mistake. He thought white people would accept him. I don't think he was mad. This man had an idea, a project. A European project. What project did Argentina and Chile have then? An American project? The King instituted a constitutional monarchy. White people brought genocide... ...armies, alcohol, smallpox. Just go to Patagonia now. What becomes of the King? Rosales, his guide, betrayed him. He was arrested. Instead of killing him... ...they declared him insane and deported him. He made 3 attempts to recover his kingdom. He failed. Yes, but he was never betrayed by the indians. Mr. De Filippis and his group back us up financially... ...and my partner Arturo Díaz Bonelli, and I... ...invested all our money in this project. Tell us about the other characters, besides the king. The Chiefs, his guide and spokesman, Rosales... ...Ministers Lachaisse and Desfontaines. - French ministers? He mentions them in his decrees to give the impression.. ...he has a large government. And you re-invent them for the same reasons? For me they're a couple of unscrupulous traders... ...who travel in a wagon with a fat whore. That's pure fiction. Like all movies. Who's the leading actor? I'm trying to find him. It's not easy. He's got to have a great presence... ...a deep conviction... ...a certain vision. The greatness of a mad man. Yes, that's it. We'll have a short break now. We'll be right back to tell you the story of Orélie Antoine... ...King of Araucanía and Patagonia... ...and of the movie about his adventure. Screen test, Orélie 1, take one, sound. Go ahead. Article One. A Constitutional Monarchy has been founded in Araucanía... ...and Prince Orélie... ...has been proclaimed King. 2, take 3. Article Two. In case the king doesn't have descendants... ...his heirs shall be... That's all right. - De Filippis sent this one. - Speak up, OK? Article One... Two. Yes, two. Article Two. In case the king doesn't have descendants... ...his heirs shall be chosen... OK, cut. Take a good look at this one. Article Three. The king is the Chief of State... ...he commands land and sea forces and declares war... ...signs peace treaties... He's got charm. That's not what we're looking for. In movies, without charm, there's nothing. Article Six. The king passes and promulgates laws. Article Seven. How's it going, Biaggi? David, here's Biaggi. How do you do? Action, come on. - Seen him yet? - No. He'll be next. Article Eight. The king grants titles of nobility at will... ...but without the right... - Of transmitting them. - ...of transmitting them. - Shall I go on? - Yes, go on. The title being purely honorary. Less make-up. They look like pottery. Speak loudly, will you? This is the one. Article Nine. Princes will become members of the Councils of Kingdom... ...and State when they reach the age of 19. He's okay. He might do the job. Right, David? Yes, he's quite young. With a little make-up and in your hands... ...he'll be a piece of clay. We, Orélie Antoine the First... ...proclaim that natural law has established that all men are... ...born equal and have the same rights... ...all human beings are equal before Death... ...and before the throne of the Great Creator of the Universe. Araucanía... ...December 10th, 1860. Here's Lachaisse... ...and here you have madame in her stiff petticoats. And this is the King. What do you think? Fine, just fine. Can't you caricature Lachaisse and Desfontaines a bit more? - A bigger hat... - Yes, sure. I want you to see the fabric. I have some ponchos that... Wait, let me see this. David! Do you need 100 indians for a shot? - What does the script say? - 100. - It says 100 indians. - I do. OK, I'll get you 100 indians... ...but you shoot those scenes in two days. I'll see. Next, I'll do tropical birds. - Get me De Filippis on the phone. - Right. Hi. Hi. - Is David in? - They're expecting you. - I've got the weapons. - Okay. Let's see. I've got more in the car. I'll go get them. - I can't take it out. - It's fake, it's a prop. David. Surrender, Patricio. I have something terrific. You can't miss it. A Brazilian actress stranded in Buenos Aires. Give her a small part and you'll have her for a song. I want to see her. You'll get the Brazilian market. Lula d'Almeira, a fantastic actress. - Hi. - Hey, how are things? - Fine. - OK, let's go. If you have a role for her don't hesitate a second. Not a second. Not a second. She's the new Sonia Braga. This is her phone number, room 252. Fill this out. write 10, 11, 12 where it says "photo". I don't usually go around seeing producers... ...but I can see you work seriously here. They told me to have a picture taken. Go over there for the photos. Don't forget the phone number. Arturo, we have to pay the headbands. - The what? - The headbands. Let's see... loincloths too. - Let Lucía OK it, - OK. For Lucía. Where are the photos? Here they are. There are some more here. David? - Yes? - The Araucan interpreter is here, - Tell Maxi to see him, - OK. They'll see you right away. - How do you do? - Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. Here they are. Samoyedos, they're terrific, perfect for Patagonia. We don't need any dogs. But they've acted in many plays, look. Arturo, Maxi wants to know if the German guy... ...must give us the money or buy the ticket himself. What German guy? The Araucan interpreter, - Tell him to give us the money. - OK. Leave the money. The King's song, 3, 4, Tomorrow I'll be in the office all morning. Hi, hello. How are you? I'm fine. You look great. Really? How are your kids? - Fine. - I'm glad. I'll call you. - How are you? - Fine. - Is the director in? - Yes, I think he's alone. Hi. Hi! I've got the papers for you to sign. I don't have a pen. I knew it. I suspected it from the very beginning. Wait, I've got some more. This one too. How are you? Triumphant, can't you see? - For how long? - Forever. Here. Don't tell me it's not possible. I know it. And what can I say? That I'm so clever you're sorry you left me. You are clever. But I'm not sorry. Don't forget to pick up the kids on Saturday. I never forget them. I know you don't. - Good luck, Your Highness. - Thanks, Princess. I forgot the fabric and... ...I must see the dressmaker early tomorrow. - Bye. - Bye. It'll be great, right? Yes. I think so. See you. Do you need anything, David? I'm leaving. No, thanks. You may leave. - Bye. - Bye. Room 252, please. That's him. what do you think? I don't know. If this guy can say one line decently, he's the king. It's risky, David. He's not an actor. What's the risk? we'll give him an audition. It's risky because you like him. Beside, De Filippis wants a star. Let De Filippis take care of the money. You get me this man. Yes? Yes, he's here. Just wait. It's for you. - Who is it? - Arturo. - Candy bar. - Yes yes. You can't find him? It can't be. It's impossible. Where did I take the photos? Where did I get them? OK, I'll find him, but you come with me. See you at noon. There he is. - Where? - There. The guy in the tunic. Which one? That one? He's shaved! The asshole shaved his head. Sounds odd to me, very odd. We're the odd ones. The thing is we don't know you, man. Besides, what's in it for him? A starring role. it's an important project. Important, yes... Everything and nothing is important. Wait, listen to me, Oso. How much do you want? I'd have to think it over. This is the busy season. - What season? - The leather season. The leather sells good. Tell me about the test. It's a test... there'll be a camera, we tape him... It's a test, a... What if it's no good? We forget about him. But you'll pay him, right? - Listen... - Of course we'll pay him. Take off your glasses. Turn right. Now left. Speak, say something. - What can I say? - I don't know, anything. You can read something. Have you got an ID? - An ID? - Yes, an ID. - Yes, I've got it. - Just read anything. "National identity Card. Name: Novak. Last name, if a female, maiden name: Ladislao. Sex, cross out as appropriate. Class 1942. Right thumb finger print." Repeat the last sentence louder. "Right thumb fingerprint." Say it with ever more energy. "Right thumb fingerprint." Very good. Look at the camera. Now say it gently. "Right thumb fingerprint". Can you ride a horse? Yes, I can. Yes, yes. Sit down properly. Your foot is too far in. It must come out easily. Loosen the reins. Not so much. Straighten up. Now dismount. Dismount! That's it. Mount again, again. Come on. Next time don't put on sandals, please. I need a guide who knows indians. - I'm a guide, sir. - What's your name? Rosales, I can read and write. - Do you speak Araucan? - No, Oso, don't look at me. Where do I look then? That way. Straight ahead. - Do you speak Araucan? - Yes, sir. It's a risky undertaking. It all depends on the pay, sir. Is this enough? For the time being. Rosales, I demand complete loyalty, do you understand? I'm not sure, sir. You must love and defend... ...your king no matter what. Again. You must love and defend your king no matter what. You must love and defend your king no matter what. Then you look hard at me. Hard. Have you understood? Stare at me. Make me answer. Have you understood? I think so, sir. When you address me, don't call me "sir". You must call me Your Highness. Rosales and Orélie ride towards a wagon... ...that rides slowly. Lachaisse and Desfontaines are inside. They are two fierce-looking French dealers. The plum madame of the brothel is with them... ...she's quite fat and laughs all the time. Lachaisse says: "This is a savage land, sir. There's no water, no shade, no human voices out there. Araucans have a voice. They're not human, sir. I'm Prince Orélie Antoine de Tounens... ...and you're not to speak of my people in those terms. Do you hear him, Desfontaines? He said "my people" - David, David. - Just a second. Come over here, please. We have problems. We can't go on. What? De Filippis is gone. - Gone? - Yes. It seems he left for Europe 3 days ago. What do you mean "it seems"? His people don't know where he is. But we've signed a contract. - Just papers. - What shall I do now? Keep rehearsing that scene. When did you see him last? I don't know, a week ago maybe. We'll go on. We'll go on, Arturo. David, wait. We must go through with it. In a week we'll be shooting down South. What about the wages? We'll only pay Oso, the rest will be a mutual association. Be serious. We'll have a meeting with the cast and the crew tonight. Listen, David... ...I always liked the idea of the movie. I have nothing against the project. Don't take it personally. You know me. I do whatever you tell me to do. But we must think of the union. Yes, right. Guys, let's get this straight. We're not rich. We must work to earn our living I know you're a nice guy, but we can't work for nothing. All right. Well, man... What happened? What did you expect? A miracle? Tell me what happened. The cast didn't accept. They'd work for the basic union wages. We'll talk about the rest. But I think we can't even pay the basic wages. You can only count on your own crew and on Lucía. Forget about the union members. All right. We'll go on anyway. Oh, yeah? without sound, for example. Without sound. Yeah? what will you do about the cast? We'll get a new cast. Sure, in the streets. In the streets. Down South. Down South. You're driving me crazy, David. I'm trying to tell you how we'll manage to shoot. You're not trying to tell me anything! You're giving me an ulcer! You're giving me a thrombosis! You're ruining my liver! You're ruining my liver! Mr, Vass, my name is Salo Bur, I've been an actor all my life and I hope I die on stage, I'm old, so I can play a grandfather... or a musician, or an immigrant. If I can be useful to you, please tell you father. He gave me your number. You're crazy, David. Don't you realize we don't have a producer? We don't have a producer. David, there's no producer. That means we don't have any money. Get it now? We have no money! I'm calling from the real state agency to remind you... ...you haven't paid the rent for two months, Thank you, It's me again, Listen, I think... Even if we get free board and room down South... ...how long could we stay there? 4 or 5 weeks at the most. Provided it never rains and nobody gets sick, Go to bed now, We'll talk tomorrow, Let's get going, the King is waiting, Let's get going, the train is ready to leave, Brave indian Chief Quilapán... ...Lord of the plains and mountains... ...feared from the sea to the volcano... ...fierce defender of the border... ...was found repairing a road... ...in downtown Buenos Aires, Obscure minister Desfontaines... ...a liquor dealer, swindler... ...cardshaper as well as a reckless adventurer... ...who cheated indians... ...was found among dames barely clothed... ...who were trying in vain to model their silhouettes, Terrifying minister Lachaisse... ...pathetic escort of harlots... ...who had once been a splendid pimp... ...covered by infamous scars... ...was found laughing for a living... ...employed by a cheap entertainer, Shrewd guide Rosales... ...a quiet, ambiguous, cunning... ...uncouth, corrupt, suspicious... ...treacherous dark half breed... ...was found playing "gaucho"... ...in a restaurant for tourists, Down by the gently flowing river... ...waiting chastely for her husband... ...exquisite in her best dress... ...the brothel keeper was found, Let's get going, the King is waiting, Let's get going, the train is ready to leave, Let's get going, the King is waiting, Let's get going, the train is ready to leave, David! David! - Hi. I thought you weren't coming. - David! Coming! Sorry, I'll be right back. Come, David, step right there, I want a picture. Everybody ready, come. Guys, wait for me! I'm here! Come on, come on! You got enough sweaters? Are you ashamed of introducing your parents? - Of course not. - Shut up, please. - Lula, they are my parents. - Pleased to meet you. Lula d'Almeira, a Brazilian actress. - Pleased to meet you. - Me too. He's always busy but... who's that? She's a Brazilian actress who's going to be with us in this. - In what? - In the movie. There's no part for her. I thought of creating a sort of tropical background. Another American dimension, see? No. Besides, she hasn't got a ticket. I've already taken care of that. This is a savage land, sir. There's no water out there... ...no shade, no human voices. Araucans have a voice. - They're not human, sir. - I'm Prince Orélie Antoine de Tounens. No, don't shout. Be blunt but don't shout. I'm Prince Orélie Antoine de Tounens. And you wont speak of my people in that way. Do you hear him, Desfontaines? - Do I? - You do. - And I don't say a word? - No. Why am I in this scene? To listen to the king. Yes. Your people? You don't look like an indian, sir. Answer him, Rosales. He's going... ...to be crowned King... ...of the Araucans. I told you I can't read very well. That's OK. It says here "whore laughs". And I am the whore. OK, OK, go on, please. Madame Lachaisse. No, no, she's not my wife. Incredible! "Desfontaines laughs". Whoever you may be, madam... ...you should know I'm going to see Chief Quiha... - Quilapán. - Quiyapán, I've got it. Quilapán, did you hear that? Do you know he swore to kill any white man who ventured South? Softly, Oso, softly. I don't blame him. But I'm different. Is that so? I'm the white man the witch doctors announced. I'll lead Araucans to victory. Quilapán won't harm you. You can follow me. What do you think about all this? The whole thing is a charade. He's a bold guy, that's all. What if he succeeds? It's very unlikely. Anyway, we didn't have anything better. Speak for yourself. Come on, don't lie to me. You won't tell me you're here for the fun of it. We have a wagon full of liquor and if it's true... ...he made a deal with Quilapán, we'll be rich. What if he didn't? If he didn't... It makes no difference, right? Right. An hour... ...the bus should've arrived an hour ago. It'll be here, darling, a big, wonderful colored bus. What's Europe nowadays? What's left there? An empty shell... in Europe everything is... Heart? Yes, the heart is no longer the heart. It's ersatz. Life is ersatz. Life is cruel, right? Get ready. The press is coming. - Doesn't this ring any bells? - No. Don't you remember Gonzalez' documentary? Why do you mention that right now? Good start. - Don't worry, the bus will be here. - Where is it? Tell me! If I say it'll be here, it'll be here. There it is! You wanted the bus, you've got it. Come on, come on, let's go! We're leaving! BOARDING SCHOOL Stay here. Nobody gets off. We'll stay here? Shut up! - Good morning, sister. - Good morning. Pleased to meet you. I think Mr. Bonano is expecting us. Yes, he's expecting you. Fine, thank you. Sister, give me a holy picture, please. - Get her! - Let me go! I just want... Get your hands off me! Look, it's signed by the minister. Yes, we've already been told. Okay... Obviously, the name of the orphanage and your name... ...will appear in the credits. We don't call it an orphanage, we call it a home. Home. No problem, Mr. Bonano. Bonnano. With 2 "Ns". Bonnano, yes, yes. Well... we know you're performers... ...but we don't want you to upset our little orphans... ...so they can stick to their daily routine... ...to their discipline. Here we sleep at night. Very well, Mr. Bonano. - Bonnano. - Bonnano. No, I shouldn't think I loved you, I'd rather forget... ...than suffer, Brothers of the Arauco, Let's share this beautiful language, Do you know him? Let's share it now, Whiskey, boy. Right away, sir. You were born here? Yes, sir. You should know Buenos Aires, don't you think? Yes, sir. Okay, go. - Hi! - Any news from De Filippis? Tonight I'll phone Buenos Aires. How many indians will I really have tomorrow? About 15, on horseback. I can get you some more on foot. I need to see them. - What for? - I need to try the outfits on them. - Try the outfits on? - The whole sequence... You must be nuts! Try the outfits on! They'll have spears and headbands, that's all. What time will you start? Rogelio, how long will we have light tomorrow? - Until about 8. - What is it? - I'd like some tea. - OK, go ahead. No, I just wanted you to know. Come on, ask for it. Let's see... - Where do we begin? - Wait. We'll begin by the close-ups on the main indian. Who's the main indian? The guy who looks most like an indian. I must choose him. Okay, I'll select a few. And then? Then the long shot, left panning. We'll stop when the wagon comes into view. The wagon! Where's the wagon? What's going on? I'm shooting! One of the horses balked. we're trying to get it going. Arturo, it's David. I leave this to you. Hello. They swore the horses could pull the wagon. Just do the close-ups, I'll take care of the horses. I can handle the horses if you want, I know how to... - Come on! - No, listen... I could handle them... ...but with those horses the scene would be awful. - New France, 12, take 2. - Marker. Action! Slower. Slower. What are we doing here, Lachaisse? What are we doing here, Lachaisse? He's a fool, a lunatic. And I'm stupid for having listened to you. - Leave me alone! - A madman, a lunatic! Leave me alone! Lachaisse. Come, come have a look. Peace, brothers. Madame must run now! Fat ass must run! But she mustn't laugh! Don't laugh! I told you Lachaisse, I told you! Peace! Peace! - Can't they go any faster? - With those spears they'd fall down! Faster! Faster! Cut! Is that all? Is my part ready? I was just working on it. Come in. What's she like? - Who? - My character. It's not just a character, it's a feeling. What does that mean? A feeling? A feeling? My character, darling. Hello, hello. Any news? I have good news and bad news. - She's so cute. - Come on, tell me. Good news first. De Filippis' secretary told me he faxed her from Munich. It seems he's made some contacts and I don't know... That's the good news. Something may come out of it. where did I put it? I had it... Tomorrow we'll have 2 indians. - They must work. - What? They've got jobs, they can't afford to lose them. Arturo, you're nuts! What shall I do? I had 15 indians in the scene. I don't know, they can't come. What shall I do? Tell me. - Pretend they left. - Where to, Arturo? I don't know, they are gone. Use sound, anything. They're gone! It seems they're leaving. To prepare the sacrifice. There're only two left. we could run away. Run away? Okay, you go first. Asshole! It's sacrilege, a crime against motherland! You can't do that! You don't have the right! Leave the flag! Property is sacred, inviolable! Shut up! Do you want them to kill us? - Respect my rank! - Shut up, shut up! Listen to your prince, Lachaisse. Listen to your prince. I demand to see the chiefs. Tell the chiefs to come here! Where are the chiefs? After this scene we'll stop for lunch. Get off, please, get off. Get the horses in place. Quickly! This way, please. Move on, get the horses over there, move on! Don't move. we're shooting! We're shooting! Lucía, move! Perfect. Lucía! - Wait! - We're shooting! Clapboard! Take one. Action! I protest against the violation of my freedom... ...I protest against people's rights... But I also protest in the name of your own rights, brothers... ...of the heroin way you fight for independence. My attention was drawn to you... ...and I've come to offer you my protection and my help. The louse is protecting the mouse. Brothers... ...let all the tribes unite under the same flag... ...respecting it and having it respected. Let them appoint a chief and let that chief bear the title of king. Clown, jester. Fool. Beloved Quilapán... ...I'm just a man among men... ...but natural law decrees... ...all men are born with the same rights. Brothers, all human beings are equal... ...before Death and the Great Creator of the Universe. That's why, brothers, as a man among men... ...I offer myself to lead you on the way to peace... ...and victory. I'm sure you were touched. - He did fine. - He's an amateur. He sounded very strong. He shouted, that's all. Art is something else. Quite true. - David? - Yes? The bus ran out of gas. we'll have to wait. Okay. Arturo! 5 pigs. I've got 5 pigs. - What's wrong? - Quilapán is drunk! Again? This fucking wind... Babe! Hurry up! Here. Do it. Get him up. My grandma would say he needs an enema of salty water. That's what she did to my grandpa, who had the chief's little problem. Has anyone got an enema here? Today I've got good news. First, I was given 5 pigs for the coronation. Second... ...finally De Filippis is doing something. He called from New York this morning. David... ...let's hurry up, a storm is gathering. Maxi! Maxi! Put him down. It doesn't matter any more... ...whether you're our friend or not. But you must know... ...in what condition you'll find the kingdom you aspire to. White men have not defeated us. But they've already done their job. Alcohol, syphilis... ...and smallpox... ...have turned our brave warriors into cowards. Even I, Quilapán... ...Supreme Chief of the Wiliches... ...son of the invincible Mañil... ...I see a sad and resigned man when I look at myself. I'll keep fighting to the end... ...but just because I swore I would. Right now I'm drunk... ...tomorrow you'll be a white stranger again... ...and I won't be able to repeat this. If you want it, this kingdom is yours. No, no, say it with more feeling. If you want it, this kingdom is yours! If you want it, this kingdom is yours. This is your kingdom. Attention, please, You're all invited to the shooting... ...of Orélie Antoine's coronation... ...as King of Araucanía and Patagonia... ...that will take place at 8 o'clock tonight... ...at Route 36 intersection, Dinner will be served after the ceremony... ...and there will be a big surprise, a Carioca Queen! Everything is free, You can't miss it! Tonight at 8 at Route 36 intersection. Chief Quilapán has just offered me the kingdom. - I'll soon be crowned. - It was true. I want you to be ministers of my government. If you refuse my men will escort you... - ...to the border of the kingdom. - That's it. - We should accept. - What's in it for us? Glory is not negotiable, Monsieur Desfontaines. Take them to the frontier and keep their weapons. A bit more. There. Now move it. No so much! Okay, that's it. David! - Is it on the way? - I don't think so. Let's go on. Don't they look great? Come on, guys. - Like them? - Yes, great. Listen. Promise me you'll behave. You'll be nice, you'll smile. Come on, promise me that. That's it. Everybody will be here. It's our one chance of getting money. Manuel, lower that a bit more. - Promise me that. - I promise, I promise. Lower it, Manuel. More, more, you too, more. Right there. Your Highness, wait! we accept. Tell him before he hands us in to the savages. We accept, sire. You must swear allegiance to me... ...to the constitution and to the flag. What's going on here? Get to work, all of you. Don't you look at me that way! We do not advocate isolation... ...we're deeply committed to integration... ...but we think unfair any bond that ignores... ...the legitimate interests of Patagonian people. That's why we think this effort is a landmark... ...on the road to true integration. And this undertaking... ...that we strongly support... ...gives us a glimpse of the great future... ...that Southern people deserve. Welcome, then. May your efforts be rewarded with great success. And now, the main event of this evening. The shooting of the coronation of Orélie Antoine I. Since this scene is so important we beg you to be quiet... Brothers... ...why has this war only brought poverty and disaster? Why? Tell me why if you've astonished the world... ...with your courageous fight for freedom and independence. Why such an outcome? Because up to now you've fought separately... ...and never trusted your brothers. Natural law, international law... Arturo, what's all this? Why are we doing all this? We're doing the coronation, David. Take it easy. That's why I've come here. To give myself to you. And to give you a constitution. Long live the union of all tribes under one chief and one flag! Long live! Long live the Kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia! Long live! - Long live New France. - Long live! Long live peace! And now, what we've promised... ...let's dance and have fun with Lula d'Aimeira... ...in a great Carioca show! Yes, guys... ...Patagonia is Latin America too. Movie industry brings our continent together... ...and it deserves our support! There he is. The bank manager. Talk to him. Be nice to him. Hi, hello. We're having fun! We'll never forget this evening. It's not artistic, but ideological weakness. If we can't see Orélie, consciously or not... ...was an agent of French imperialism, this whole thing is meaningless. We have no financial problems, we have international support. Our weak point is cash. I know what you mean. This great celebration organized by movie people... ...is the result of an artistic and financial effort. Movies need our support! Hi. Are you so formal as all people from Buenos Aires? No, I'm not. So ask me to dance. Of course. Movies bring happiness to our people. Let's repay their generosity with generosity. Antonio! Antonio! Antonio! My dad! My dad! Where are you? If I catch him I'll... Dirty bastard! I'll kill him! I'm a reporter. Can anyone be a reporter in such a small town? Luckily, I have my poetry. Poetry saves people! Poetry! If I told you the problems I have at the bank... Arturo! Arturo! - What is it? - Please, Arturo... Go away! Arturo! Excuse me, I'll be right back. I must go. You city people! You come and go. I must go on shooting. Okay, go. This doesn't feel right. This doesn't feel right. It was quite a success. Banks lend money only to those who have money. The Culture Department is very enthusiastic, but they're broke. No one showed up from the Tourism Department. And... ...my checkbook has wings. - Want more? - Is there more? Go to bed. What's wrong with him? There's plenty of time! - We'll have to send him back. - Why? He can't be seen around here. He must go back. I'll go with you. - Go to bed. - I'm not sleepy, I'll go with you. I'm glad I didn't tell you before. I was looking for you! - Will they follow us? - Cover yourself up, please! Get out. - Come on, get out. - Were we followed? No, nobody followed us, get out. Won't you say a word? won't you even say you're sorry? I'm sorry. Don't you worry, darling. You got it all wrong. You didn't need a character nor a woman. I got it wrong too. We just made a mistake, that's all. You won't leave before the bus comes, right? No, I won't leave. It's a long trip. I'll be hungry. Here. Look, Arturo... ...I'm not sorry for what I did. - I didn't force him... - Okay, okay, it's okay. Why do I feel so ashamed then? I don't know. Okay, let's go, let's go. Lula! Lula, come on! Your movie will be beautiful. It'll be a great success. Everybody will love it. Don't look at them. They've been murdered, but don't look at them. Don't stop. You're a king. Kings must hold back his feelings. You're going to the capital city to be acknowledged as king... ...and to sign an honorable peace treaty. Don't look at them. If you look at them, everything will seem sheer madness... ...failure. Don't let anger or sadness... ...overcome you. Where's Rosales? Rosales! Rosales! Cut! You did well, Oso, very well. David, tell me, is anything wrong? No, nothing is wrong. Arturo didn't pay me this week. Thank you, Lord... ...for the food we're about to eat. May we be worthy of sitting at the Lord's Table. Amen. Something's wrong, Arturo. - Something's wrong. - You stay here, don't move. - What's wrong? - I didn't do it! - Tell me what's wrong! - I swear I... Don't waste your time, Arturo, it's useless. I swear, I didn't do it! Okay, let's go, everybody get on the bus. Hurry up, don't forget anything. Now what? You relax, just shoot the movie. Come on! Bonano... ...up yours with your orphanage! What's wrong now? That's what we'd like to know. We were kicked from the orphanage. We want to know what's next. - We're hungry. - Let me in. Listen, we'll get some tents from the army. They're first rate tents. Then we'll reschedule everything. As the cast shop steward I'm worried about one thing... ...where are we going to eat? First the tents, then lunch. We still have a lot of money available. Really? I don't owe you any explanation! Then I won't listen to you! We either eat and sleep in a decent place or we quit. You're playing artist at our expense. What about the women? Don't forget women! Listen, listen carefully. I'll go on. I'll finish the movie at any cost. I won't guarantee anything to anybody, not even... ...that we're doing something good! Not even that! I'll go on, no matter what! I may be wrong but this is how I make my living. So now you know! If you refuse to stay Arturo will take you to the station. You heard him. Make up your minds, now! - I'll get paid, right? - Yes, get off. Go on. I'm still on my Heidelberg scholarship. - Yes, yes. - I can stay. Okay, get out. Arturo, let's go home, this thing is dead. I feel much better now. Are you sure you don't want anything? No. Tea is just fine. Good morning. Brandy, please. Wait. Don't pay, yet. You won't give up now, right? No. I feel sick. I'll be right back. The check, please. Treason! Treason! Surrender, Frenchman! Never! Surrender, Frenchman! You're surrounded! Help me! Help me! Don't force us to shoot! You're alone! Treason! This is the best we can do. Now we must work things out... ...and get everything under control. Right? I shouldn't think... ...I loved you, it's better to forget... ...than to suffer, I can't believe it's all over... ...that this dream of love... ...is over... ...that life has made us part... ...unwillingly. Let's keep on walking... ...maybe we'll meet again. Arturo, Arturo! Now what? Nothing. I need dummies. - What? - Dummies. 20 or 30 of each kind. we'll shoot the rest with dummies. It makes sense. Of course it does. When Orélie realizes he's been betrayed... ...everything becomes unreal for him. People don't understand him... ...so he can't consider them human. In his mind, the soldiers who arrest him are dummies. - Yes... - He sees them through the eyes of a lunatic. He's crazy, do you get it? That's why he sees everybody, judges, soldiers... ...as if they were dummies, all of them are dummies! Where's Rosales? Where is he? Rosales! Lachaisse! Lachaisse! Where are my ministers? What's going on? Rosales! Rosales! They've abandoned you, they've fled! You're surrounded! They've betrayed you! They are your judges! They will judge you, Orélie Antoine! They are here to judge you! Look at them! They're laughing at you! They don't take you seriousiy, Your Highness! 9 months and 3 days. You've been in this cage for 9 months and 3 days You're running a fever, losing your hair. Peopie iook at you as if your were a freak in a circus. Nobody wants you. They send you from court to court. They're afraid of you, Frenchman, afraid! At last, today the sentence was handed down. You disrupted public order, incited to rebellion. And what does the court say? Neither the gallows nor the firing squad. They declared you insane, Your Highness! The cowards've declared you insane and they'll deport you. In case we shouid die soon, ...we think we must make a will and last testament. The Crown of Araucania and Patagonia will be bequeathed... ...to Jean de Tounens, our beloved father. Should he refuse it, to Jean de Tounens, our beloved brother. Should he refuse it, to his son, Adrien Jean de Tounens... ...and to his heirs in succession in perpetuity. It's my personal check. You can trust me. If it bounces, I'll go to jail. What good is that to me? I'm telling you I'll go to jail. No, brother, no. Work is work and money is money. This is like money. Listen, Oso... ...the movie is almost finished. The return of the king and... I don't have any cash right now. Me neither. If there's no money I'll quit. - You're a scumbag! - Wait... - Fucking blackmailer! - Take it easy. I'll kill you, motherfucker! Peace, brother! No vioience! Go away and don't you ever come back, motherfucker! Reiax, reiax. Fuck off! I don't need him! I don't need him. I don't need him any more. What's wrong with fire? More fire! I want more fire! More, Arturo, more! What's going on? You're under arrest for starting a fire. - What fire? - What's wrong? You're under arrest. - Come on. Stay on guard. - Yes, sir. 2 flags. 2 medals. Another medal. A wig. A sword and... ...and a pencil. Sign here. A fax from De Filippis, 20th. Century Fox is interested. I'd advise you to take the first train out of here. I could get you out, but I know this won't end here. Do you know Borques? - Who? - Pedro Borques, the fake inca. The Andalusian who led 4,000 indians to revolt... ...against the Spaniards in the Caichaquíes Valleys... ...in the XVII century. Quite a story! The fake inca. Can you imagine? 4,000 indians led by an Andalusian swindier. It's quite a story.
