[relaxing instrumental music] [phone ringing] - Hey, sweetheart! - Guess who will be designing the Hall Manor on Bourbon Street? - The most brilliant architect I know, my handsome husband. - You know, I am talented, aren't I? - Yeah, you are. So, what are you gonna do your last night in New Orleans? - Hm. I'll find some trouble to get into. - I'm sure you will. Just be safe, okay? - Always. - Well, Noelle and I are gonna go out for a drink, so I'll text you when I get home, all right? I love you. - Love you too. Tell Noelle I said hey. - All right, bye. [lighthearted r&b music] - Come on, let's go. - All right. [lighthearted r&b music] - [Noelle] Wren, let's go! - I'm coming, I'm coming. Okay. - I was thinking, you stay a couple of days, I can show you my city. - I already told you the rules. After tonight, I can't see you again. We good? - All good. [dramatic music] [humming] [whistling] [lighthearted music] - Ah, there she is. Good morning. - Good morning. - Uh huh. Voila. - Pancakes and passports. - We are almost at 10 years. - Yes. - It's time to celebrate. Look in the bag. - Strawberries and mint, very nice touch. - Uh huh. I learned from the best. - Aw! These are from our honeymoon. - We are going back to Belize. Three days after our anniversary. - What? I thought you said you couldn't step away from the office. - And you said you wanted a vacation, right? Well, Belize is one of our favorite places. - You know what's truly one of my favorite places? - What's that? - Right here, in your arms. [laughing] - Oh. That sounds like one of those corny statements from one of your greeting cards that you store. [laughing] - Still true though. - Yeah, um, well, I'm gonna need you to, I don't know, maybe work on your game a little bit. Just... - Oh, really? This from the guy whose opening line was, "Excuse me, I like your hat". You need to work on your game, sir. - Ah. - Mm! - Shall we? - Mhm. ♪ I want to give you all of me and more ♪ ♪ And I want to be the one who'll be on your side ♪ [laughing] ♪ Your heart is saving me - I love it when we dance. - Yeah. - Yeah, just makes me feel innocent, and reminds me of our first date.

[laughing] - Cameron! - The hat comment was, yeah. - Ah, you're so rude, you're so rude. - Actually, I knew you were the one the first time I saw you. - Okay, yeah, yeah. - No, no, no. Seriously.

Thank you, have a good day. Thank you so much for your recommendation. I got an interview. - Oh, that's great news, Luna. That's a really incredible pastry program. - I know. - I would've killed to have studied abroad when I was your age. - Hey there, sweet darling! - Hey, Mr. Charlie. Hey, you know what? I got you that special brew I know you love. - Oh, that's good, that's right. [chuckling] Here you go. - Thank you. - Doctor told you to cut back on the caffeine. - 42 years and she's still trying to run me. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Psh. - 42 years of love? - Mhm. - Advice? - Oh, it's all in the rhythm. [laughing] - All right now, Miss Ruth. - Love and marriage is like dancing to a song with an ever changing rhythm. The key is to hold on to each other and stay on beat. - You two have never gotten off beat? - Oh, sure we have. He stepped on my toes a few times too. [laughing] But we just have to keep dancing until we find our rhythm again. That's the secret, baby. That is the secret. - Thank you for that. - Mhm. [chuckles] [text message beeps] - Hey! - Hm? - Don't forget the party tomorrow. - Oh, girl. We will be there. - [Noelle] You better be! - You know, it's funny. When I was a little girl, I used to fantasize about being married for 50 years and having a party, surrounded by my kids, and my grandkids. - Yeah. You know what though, girl? These days, it's hard for most women to find even one man to date. - Says the woman with a husband and a boyfriend. [laughing] - I am not most women. - Yeah, that's true. Still, there's just something wonderful about unconditional love. - Honey, let me tell you something. Marriage is a lot of things. Unconditional is not one of them. What are you gonna get him for the big anniversary gift? - Ah, you know, I don't know. I was thinking about this architectural set of pens, they're supposed to be like 20 different... [snoring] Okay, you know what, that's rude. Stop that. - Have you not listened to anything I've taught you? I mean come on, surprise him with something sexy. You know, like one year I got Trevor this nude photo of me, and he loved it. Schwing! [laughing] - [Wren] You are so crazy. - I give 'em two years. - [Wren] Noelle, why would you say that? - Because, look at her, she's in love with the idea of love. I mean, look at how she's fawning all over that silly cake topper. - I mean, you can't know that it's not real love. - You can't call it real love until it's been tested. That much I do know. [dramatic music] - We are collaborating with the city to build an international museum of art. - Okay. - We are partnering with an architectural firm on the design. - Okay. - Smith Copeland is at the top of my list. I studied the facade of the new Lee Building. It's part Romanesque, part modern. Nice job. - That's exactly what I was going for. - Well, you nailed it. On top is our standard NDA, the rest are details and specs, and my assistant can email you that as well. You know, the board has reservations about me courting a smaller firm, but I think you're the man for the job. [dramatic music] - I think life is one big bridge, and we're all going over one crossroad to connect to the next level of our journey. I'm the artist, Mars. - Hi, Morrison. - Karena. [laughing] - Hi. - Good to see you. - You too! - You look great. - Oh, thank you. And it's Wren now. - Oh. [laughing] Okay. - Yeah, you know, I was surprised to get your DM. - Yeah, well, no way I was gonna come to town and not let you know. - What has it been, years? - Yeah, I've been traveling, a lot. And my mom lives with me in New York. - Oh, nice. - I rarely come home. - Yeah. Well, I mean, I've seen your work online, but I mean in person, Mars, this is breathtaking. - Thank you. Yeah, that was taken in Peru. - These are really beautiful. Gosh, look at you, just living your dream. I should do a photo shoot with you, you make everybody look amazing. - Just say when, I'm here for three weeks. - Maybe, okay. - Come on, let's get out of here, let's go catch up. - No, but I haven't even seen everything. - You mean, you came here just to see my work? - Yes, why else would I be here? - Okay, I see. Let me show you my favorite piece then. - Oh my God. Look at me. That's the bridge we used to cross on our way to school. - Yup. That was the first picture I ever took. You know, I still have that camera you gave me? - Um, okay, I confess. I never told you this, but, I stole the money to get you that camera from my mother, so I got my ass beat. [laughing] - No! - Yeah. [laughing] - Well, if it makes you feel any better, that gift changed my life. - See, I didn't know that. - Is that bridge still there? Put this on your calendar. - 24th, 8:00 PM? - Mhm. - It's my wedding anniversary. - So, both of you come. - We always do this thing that we did on our first date, but we'll see. [laughing] - You remember these? - Yes. - Hm? They get all stuck in your braces, but they were your favorite. - Yeah, well. - Yeah. - I don't eat candy anymore. - Really? - No. - There was this place near my flat in London that made flavored Rice Krispies, just like your mom. I think of you whenever I passed. - You lived in London? - I met a girl. [laughing] - Of course you met a girl. How'd that go? - Lasted almost a year. - Oh! - She wanted me to wear a tie, and do the whole bespoke thing. - Do you even own a tie? - Yup. The one she bought me. [laughing] - Oh my gosh. Oh! I've never been to London. - No? - Nah uh. - I would love to show you around the Big Smoke. Oh yeah, yeah, that's right. You've already got a tour guide. - Mhm. [lighthearted music] - One more for the books. Right on. I'll send this to you. - This bridge holds a lot of memories. - Yeah it does. I remember one in particular. Do you? After school picnic, 16th birthday. - Yes, Mars. A girl doesn't forget her first time. Stop looking at me. [laughing] Here. - [Mom] Baby girl. - Momma, how many times do I need to tell you about locking your door. - What a surprise. - Yeah, I know. I was in the neighborhood. - Really? - Mhm. - Your brother just asked about you. They're changing his visiting hours, maybe we'll go see him next week. - Uh, yeah, sure. I'm not gonna keep ordering you this cheese if you don't eat it. - Ain't nothing wrong with cheddar, Karena. - Yeah, well, you're saying that because you haven't tried it. This is Winnimere. - Winnimere? Now that'd be a pretty name for my granddaughter. - Momma, please. - When women adopt, sometimes God make them pregnant. They save a child, and he do them a solid. Tit for tat. - Eat the cracker, Momma. [lighthearted music] What? - You look just like your daddy. Bastard. - I look like you too. - No, the smarts, that's what you got from me. - Oh, Ma! Come on, this table... When are you gonna let me redecorate? - Oh, not that again. - Ma'am. Listen. I'm going to the antique store this weekend 'cause I need to find some stuff for the cafe, and I'm buying you a dining room table. - Have at it. Your mother only shop online these days. - Yeah. About that. You need this. - Oh, let me show you my makeup I got yesterday. Came in the mail. - You really shouldn't be buying makeup that you don't try on first. - Flamingo. Ain't that pretty? Try it on. - Nah uh. - Come on, girl. It's smooth. We look good in pink. - No thank you. [dog barking] - Honesty, yeah, check. He's honest with me, of course. Next is the, oh, transparency, absolutely. What's next? Oh, the center of the, oh my... Babe! - Hey, what's up, baby? - Ah, I am so glad Wren finally agreed to host our book club this afternoon. The girls and I, we cannot wait to get her marriage secrets. Oh, and you know what? This book is really good! It says that only 40% of couplesare honest with each other. - Oh. - Yeah. Hm. Are you honest with me? - Honest enough. - Enough? Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I think we should have 100% transparency in our relationship. - Nah. - So, you want me to lie to you? - Look. We got a winning team. So, stop worrying. - We do. - Right? - Mhm. - And you don't have to win every game to go to the Super Bowl. - But I want a perfect season. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. - Yeah, I see. Yeah, I'll see what I can do, coach. - Do you lie to Cameron? Come on, be honest. What happens in the book club... - [All] Stays in book club. - Yes. - I mean, yes. I have lied to Cameron in the past, but now, we do our best to tell each other the whole truth, even if it hurts. - Why, I lie to Brian all the time. "Is that a new dress?" Oh, no, honey. This is ancient. - Well, when we were dating, I lied to Washington and told him I loved football. I hate it. I know love is about embracing your partner's imperfections. I mean, come on. He coaches all day, talks football all night. I just want to implement a no football day. What do you think? - Listen, Courtney. When I met Cameron, I didn't know anything about chess, I didn't play chess. And now, I'm better than he is. - Hm. But why would you... - Because my mom, she wigged out over everything my father ever did. Right? She cussed and she fussed, and eventually he left. She started off angry and ended up lonely. - You know, I hate to say it, but my mom did too. - Courtney. No one has all the answers, right? And every couple has to determine what works for them. But in my opinion, if you want your marriage to last, then you compromise and adapt. [snapping] - It's nice to meet you. - It's nice meeting you as well. - We should hang out some time. - I wouldn't mind that at all. - You know, while we're here, let me get your number before you get swept away. - [Woman] How about that? - You know, I will use this. - Make sure you do. - Hey. - Hey. This is Tyra. - Hi Tyra, I'm Wren. - Hi. Well, have a good day. - You too, it was nice meeting you. [chuckling] - I'm sorry I wasn't able to ride over with you, work was crazy today. - Yeah. - How you doin', you good? - I'm great. - Yeah? - Zoey Taylor says I have a futuristic eye. - That's the new client, right? - Yeah, she's dope. She was a project manager of a 50 million dollar job at 25. - Wow. - Runs a Fortune 500 company, been on the Forbes list. - Look at you, fanning. Hm, she's your Beyonce, huh? - No. - Hm. Can I have a white wine, please? - Maybe. [laughing] I mean a reference like hers can change your career overnight. - Good. Congratulations, I'm happy for you. - Well, this is congratulations for us. This is a game changer. How was book club? - Ah, you know. I still stick out like a sore thumb. I know, I mean, you should've seen them in their bright sundresses and delicate little teacups, and there I was in denim. Practical and sturdy, like a tumbler. - You could be delicate. - Yeah, I can be anything. - Well, I am happy that you are bonding with your sister-in-law. She likes you. You ready? - Uh, yeah, yeah. Mhm. - All right. And for the record, all my favorite drinks come in a tumbler. [laughing] Did Noelle give us any rules? - No. She just said that if we didn't like it, we could leave. Thank you. - Well, all right. Well then, let's go. - Okay. - Mhm, after you. - Great. ♪ Give me your love ♪ Over again, over again ♪ Over and over, give me all your love ♪ ♪ Over again, over again ♪ All over ♪ You're being selfish ♪ You got me strung out - Okay, but is that really a thing? I mean, one penis policy is way too chauvinistic, I would never. - OPP works. And she can have as many girlfriends as she wants. - Mm, I see. So, what, you want me to be a part of your stable? [laughing] I was joking. - Ah. Looks and a sense of humor. You are stealing my heart. - And how many times have you said that tonight? - Only once. [laughing] - Hey. There you are. - Hey, love. Ed, this is my husband, Cameron. Cameron, this is Ed. - Lucky man with a gorgeous wife, nice to meet you. - Yeah. - You know, your wife intrigues me. - Is that so? - It is. You know, you two should meet my girlfriend. I'll be right back. - "Your wife intrigues me". [laughing] - Aggressive, right? I thought I was gonna have to him just to get out of here. - That's what you were thinking about? - What? - Nothing. - Babe, I'm tired. Can we go? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. I think coat check is back this way. - Hey, let me borrow your charger. - What, again? Cameron, don't lose it, okay? And your phone is always dying. Here. - Okay, yeah, I need an upgrade. Okay? [melancholic music] - Check this out. - What is that? Since when did you start using a dating app? - Oh, Trevor put me on this tonight. It's an invite for the group. - Oh. So, you had fun tonight? - Ah, it was cool. Gotta admit though, knowing and seeing is different. I prefer our thing. - Yeah, me too. Although, I have to admit, it was sort of a turn on watching you get jealous. - Oh, really? - Mhm. - How much? [laughing] How much were you turned on, darling? [laughing] How much were you turned on? [laughing] So, if we pivot the building about 32 degrees left from where it is here, we can still install the full rotate panels which will generate energy from the sun. It'll help you save money. - There will still be pieces that can't be exposed to the sunlight, so can we do that for like half of the building? - We can do whatever you like. - [Zoey] I like the sound of that. [clears throat] - Hey. Zoey, this is my wife, Wren. - Pleasure to meet you. - Hi. - Cameron says you own Bistro Bites, I love your place. - Thank you. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. - Oh, no, I just stopped by to go over the blueprints. You guys are the little power couple. Cute. Cameron, we'll talk later? - Okay. You'll have the soft proposal in your box in the morning. Thank you again for the opportunity. - Absolutely. - Mhm. - Bye. - Look at you, all starry eyed. - Hey, she's feeling your boy too. - Mhm. - Not like that. First of all, I'm a professional. Second of all, she's too much of a boss chick to share anything. - Well, I see you've thought about it. - I don't mix business with pleasure. Okay, can we not bring that up, please? - Okay, fine. Listen, I got you something. Just to say that I'm proud of you. It's a little corny. - Let me see. Ah, it's a little big... [laughing] But I love it. - Oh, good. - Come here. - I'm glad you love it. - Mhm. - I gotta get to work, so. - I'll walk you out. - Thank you. - How bout that? [laughing] - I can't tell you my secrets, babe. [dramatic music] - [Woman] Hold the door, please. - Aw, congratulations. Do you know what you're having? - A boy. [dramatic music] - [Cameron] How did you even find me? - You left some of these on the kitchen counter. Thank God, 'cause it's not like I knew your real name or anything. But I see you're big time. I read all about you in the Urban Enterprise. Nice office, nice suit. Who knew? - You knew the rules. - I'm setting up a lab appointment. - You're not gonna trap me. - Well, I'd hate to tell your wife that you're not willing to take this test. - You're not gonna tell my wife shit, 'cause that's not my baby. - Sorry I'm late. How long have you been waiting? - About 18 years. [laughing] - Well, before I start looking at cafe tables, I need to find a table for my mom. - Yeah, I was checking this out. What do you think? - It's nice, but you know, you know Betty. - Ah. Yes, I do. - You know, I like this, I like this. - Yeah, this is nice. Oh hey, looks like it's made from two different wood, check this out. Feel this. - Uh! - Check this out, feel. - Oh, that's right. I forgot, your uncle used to make furniture. - Yeah. - I mean, I like that it has storage, but I don't know, I don't know if she'll like it. - You know, your father refuses to drive me out here. But this is where all the good antiques are. - Oh, it's no problem, Mother. We need a chest for our blankets anyway. [dramatic music] - We have a guest speaker at church tomorrow. You and Washington should come. It's important married couples stay in church. - Isn't that... [dramatic music] - All right, you ready, big man? - Hey! I need to talk to you. - Hey fellas, take five, aight? - Babe! - What? - Wren is cheating on Cameron. - Man, what are you talking about? No. - Yeah, no, yes! This guy was kissing on her neck. She was just bragging about being married. Such a lying hypocrite. - Did you say something to her? - No, honey! No. My mother was with me. - Okay. - And she questioned me the entire ride home. Oh my God. Look, I have to lie and say that Wren had a twin. I hate lying to my mother. - Okay. - You know how close we are. - I understand, but I gotta get back to work. - No, you don't. Listen, this is serious! - This ain't that serious! I gotta finish practice. - Listen, Mars. I really appreciate you doing this photo shoot for me, but how much do I owe you? - Well, you let me take pictures for my show, I'll call it even. - Deal. [dramatic music] So, where do you want me? - Start this right here. Right there. - Here? - Yes, yes, yes, yes. - All right. - All right, look this way. - Like that? - Yeah. Good. You know what? - What? [laughing] - All right. Look, trust me. - Okay, I trust you. - Yes. - All right. Good? - Good. Okay, let's see here. [shutter snaps] Mhm, nice. Mhm. [shutter snaps] - What? - Move your sleeve. How about this right here. - Okay. Stop. - Sorry. Husband, I know, I know, I know. [offkey piano music] - You know what? - What? - You're probably not gonna believe this, but Cameron and I are actually in an open relationship. - No you're not. - Yes, we are. But we have boundaries, and this crosses the line. So... - For real? - Yeah. - Well, I dated a girl who was poly once. What you got, threesomes? Foursomes? - Okay, you know what? Nevermind. I should never have told you. Let's just take pictures, okay? - All right. - Oh, Sheesh. [laughs] - Doesn't seem like you. All right. [dramatic music] Nice. I like that. Oh, that's good. You've done this before. - I have not done this before! - Yes you have. Come on. - All right, let me see, let me see. How's it turning out? - Okay. - Okay. Okay, how do I look at it? - Just mash this right here. - Okay. Oh, wow. The lighting's beautiful. Wow, this is really... Oh, I like this one. - Mhm, that one? - Yeah. [intense music] Okay. Sorry, Mars. You know what? This is not a good idea. I didn't mean to waste your time, but I gotta go. This is completely against the rules, and, you know, I'll figure out some other kinda present. I cannot break the rules. You cannot break the rules, Wren. You cannot break the rules. You cannot break the rules. Shit! I forgot my...

[melancholic music] - Why didn't you tell me? We're in this together. - I didn't want to make a big deal about it. But, if it's okay with you, I'd like to stop taking the shots. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I mean, you know. I'm good, if it happens, it happens. - Yeah. - So, what did you want to tell me? - Uh, nothing important. - And you're sure you're okay with this? - You're amazing.

Trouble in newlywed paradise? - Not quite. I just need to holla at you about something, man. - About what? - About Wren. Look, man, I think I might've seen her with another guy. It looked inappropriate, kissing. Aight, forget about it man. Should've kept it to myself. - I probably should've told you this before, but we agreed not to. Wren and I have been in an open marriage for about two years. - Wait. What? Get outta here man, you're playing. - We're not wired for monogamy. - Oh. - Wren understands that. - So you're cheating, I got it. - It's an agreement. It ain't cheating. - Wait. It's a sweep, it's a running play. Same thing. - Look. Why is the divorce rates so high, huh? People are suffocating in marriage. - How about people are selfish. - You've been married two months, talk to me in 10 years. - Man, all right. Mom and dad, they've been married for over 30 years, they didn't seem to have a problem. - I don't recall them ever kissing. They was on auto-pilot, check. Who knows if they was even happy. - Are you serious? - Dad worked two jobs. Came home, went to sleep, woke up. Did it again, died of a stroke. I don't even know if he lived. I'm living. Look. I can be honest with Wren, and I am thankful for that. - I feel you on the honesty, but the other man? - You know what? I wouldn't stand on the roof if I was afraid of heights. I know my wife. Wren is honest and respectful. She's 200% committed to this marriage, and nothing and no man can shake that. Got you. [dramatic music] - Okay, girl. What's up? Late night visit. Hm? - I'm in trouble. - Oh boy. There's the trouble that finds you, or the trouble you go looking for.

An ex, twice. Three times. - Leaving work early, disappearing in the middle of the day. I should've known. Girl, never hook up with exes, it's the cardinal rule. - I know. I feel like I'm drowning. - Look. In this game, you have to be very clear about your intentions, and why you're doing this. It's the only way to keep from losing yourself. [laughing] - The light right here. If she passed that, that'd be great. - Mhm. - Yeah. - You just looked at her butt. - What? No I didn't. - Oh my God, I saw you. - I just... Babe. I love your butt, I love your body. Okay? Jeez. - It's fine, it's natural. Two of my friends are getting divorces because of affairs. And Noelle's marriages ended for that reason, and you know my dad had a whole nother family. - Okay, look. I have not cheated, and I do not want another woman. Okay? - I saw the text messages between you and Deb. - I did not sleep with her, and you have no business being in my phone. - You're right. But don't lie to me, Cam, because I saw all of them. - Okay. We were flirting. We had dinner a few times, all right? It was wrong. We did not have sex, and it's done. She's not even in the office anymore, so. - Okay. - Wren, I'm not lying. - Cameron, I can't control what you do, and I'm not gonna obsess over it. I saw what it did to my mother. Noelle and Trevor have been in an open relationship for over three years. - What? How did I miss that? - Well, you're always working, plus you don't hang out with us, and I didn't want to tell you 'cause I didn't want you to freak out, and I thought you might have a problem with it. - No. As long as she respects our marriage. - I mean, she says that it's the best relationship she's ever had because her and Trevor and able to be completely honest about their feelings. - She and Trevor, hm. Wow. - What if we tried it? I mean, I don't think it's completely realistic to think that people can be faithful. - What are you saying? - We should think about being open. Noelle, I thought that we were mature enough to handle this. - Everybody thinks that until the shit goes down, Wren. - It's, you know, Cameron gets to have his fantasy and then come home to me, and me, I can't stop thinking about the few guys I've been with. - You have to learn to reprogram yourself to love differently than the way you were taught. Now... About this guy. [calming r&b music] Are you gonna see him again? [calming r&b music] Ugh. [calming r&b music] - I waited up for you. - Yeah. I went to Noelle's house. You looked so peaceful sleeping, I didn't want to wake you. Apple or banana? - Apple. Wash saw you with another man. He thought you were cheating. - Did he tell Courtney? - I'm sure he didn't, but I told him the truth. - Cameron, we said we weren't gonna say anything. - Then you shouldn't go around kissing men in public.

If I didn't know any better, I'd say you and that mango got something going on. [chuckling] - I had one the other day, I forgot how much I like them. - Hm. So, we got Belize and our anniversary party. You still want to go to Harry's? - Yes. It's tradition. I want my Harry's ice cream, okay? Do not try to bail on me. - Never. - Babe. Where'd you get this? - Oh, it's a gift from Zoey. She said all the designers in her office have them. Hm. [phone ringing] - Hey, Max. So, I had a couple of extra cupcakes from an order, I left them in the break room. All right. [text message beeps] - Hey, babe. - DNA results? - I've never put you at risk, okay? The child is not mine. - After everything we've been through? - You really think I'm putting myself out there like that? - I don't know what you're doing! - I don't know what you're doing! You know, I've never broken the rules. Have you? - Just take the phone, take it, look. [dramatic music] - It's negative. I told you. I can't believe you didn't trust me. - I'm inviting you to our New York office this weekend. I'll introduce you to our strategic partners, members of the board. It's important you get affiliated with everyone before you give your presentation. - Uh, I'm in Belize. It's my anniversary. - Anniversaries come once a year. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. - Okay. I'll just talk to Wren. - Great. Shall we go talk to her together? - Nah. I can handle it. - Look, I spoke very highly of you to everyone. Told them you were ready, told them you could commit. I hope I didn't speak too soon. - [Mars] Hey. - Hey. What are you doing here? - I called you last night. - Yeah, I know. I was busy. - Oh. Well, can you talk? - Yeah, sure. - Emailed you a link to the photos. - Yeah, I got it, thank you. - Hey, come closer. [dramatic music] You know, I was thinking about the whole open thing. If you were my wife, I would never share you. - You don't know a thing about being married. - Well, I know a wife deserves a different level of respect. Men are responsible for her heart. She's mine. - We're not possessions, Mars. - Yeah, well, you're not trading cards either. - I'm gonna go back in, and you're gonna leave. Okay? - I'm sorry, I shouldn't of said that. I shouldn't of said that. - Hey, hey, Zoey. How are you? Thank you so much for dropping by. Good to see you. You here stopping by for a late lunch? - Not quite. I actually just came to have a talk with you. One boss to another. - Oh, okay. Can I get you something? - No, thank you, I'm good. - Have a seat. - Mm. - She wants me to convince you to go. - I told her I would handle this. - She even tried to bribe me. Said I should go with you to New York, and she'd throw in a spa day at The Seasons. No, it's not funny. I thought that was out of line. You know? She don't know me. - Baby, she's a deal maker, okay? She has a lot riding on this, that's all. - So, what, we're just gonna... You're gonna go to New York and we postpone Belize? - Only if you don't mind. You know. - Gotta do what you gotta do, right? - This is why I love you. - But let the record show, I don't trust her. - Okay, you seem a little tense. Let me help you out with that, how about that. - You know, babe. I honestly just came home to eat with you, I gotta get back and work on this cake. - Babe, just for 15 minutes. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Really, I'm good. All right? So, I will be home before midnight. - Okay, well call me when you're locking up, all right? - Okay. - I love you. - I love you, bye. - Be safe. - Night, Wren. - Goodnight, Luna. [sighs] Shit. [knocking] - Hey. - When I said I was at work, it was not an invitation. - I know, I know, I just want to see you in person. Now, I'm sorry about earlier. I just want you to be happy. - I am happy. Me, my life, my marriage. We're good. - Okay. Truce? [lighthearted music] - Truce. - All right, what do you say we grab a drink when you're done here, hm? - Listen, I was actually gonna go home. So I'll just come back and finish up in the morning. - All right, look. The truth is, I can't stop thinking about you, and us, and the times we used to spend together. - That's just it, Mars. We were kids, those times are gone. - Do they have to be? I mean, you can travel on the weekends, come and see me. - I already told you, it doesn't work like that. - It can work like that. Look, I enjoy being with you. I know you enjoy being with me. [dramatic music] - Where you been? - What are you doing sitting in the dark? Come on, let's go upstairs. - Just dance with me. - What? No, come on. - I just need to feel that innocence, okay? Just dance with me. [humming] - Okay, come on, Cam, I'm tired. Come on, let go. Stop, you're hurting me! What are you doing? - What are you doing? [dramatic music] Is this who Wash saw? Just, how many times did you sleep with him? Three? Five? 10 times? How many times? Just tell me. Just tell me how many times. - I'm sorry. - You know, I never broke the rules. Never. You wanted this, Wren, you did. Rule number one, just say it, say it. Rule number one, what is it? What do we say, what do we say? Hm? - No intimate activities. - Okay, two. What was rule number two? - We never deny that we're married. - We never deny that we're married, right? You know, number three says that you can only do it with the person one time, there's no emotional attachment. Just one time, Wren, that's it. Okay. What's rule number four? Say it! - You can't sleep with anyone you have a history with. - That's right. You know, that's right. That's right. Okay, so all ex boyfriends are off the table. - And ex girlfriends. - We're strong enough to do this, right? - We'll talk to Noelle and Trevor, they've been open for years. - Okay, well, the big picture is we stay committed to our marriage, and if it doesn't work... - We'll just stop. - This could be interesting. - Yeah, I mean, it's no lying about anything. - What's rule number six? - Never lie. - Say the whole thing! - Never lie ever, under any... - Any circumstances! [dramatic music] You end that shit, now. [dramatic music] - What if Wren wants to sleep with you? - Why are we still talking about this? - Because, it's important, baby. Duh. - Look. I do not want an open relationship. - Okay. - But, I swear it would be nice if you were cool enough to talk about things without getting an attitude. - I don't get, okay. But I don't... What do you mean, hm? - What I mean is, most people are more honest with their friends than they are their spouses. - You can tell me anything babe, you know that. - Okay. So, I want to go to their anniversary party tomorrow. - Oh, no, no. Give me something else, really? - I sneak and go to the strip club. - What? - Mhm. - I knew I saw glitter on our pillows a few weeks ago. I can't believe you! Really? You would just go to the strip club and not even... - See? Right there, that's what I'm talking about. Since men can't be honest with their wives, they spend half their marriages being quiet. Mhm.

Morrison. - Oh my God, that boy has always been trouble. Things never change. - He's a big time photographer now, travels all over the world. - Whoop-de-doo. I got my passport. - No, you don't. - Whatever. What makes him so special? - I don't know, it's like, he sees me. - Well, you easy to see. Especially when you have nowhere to hide. You remember when your brother used to give you the crayons only in the color that was right for the picture? - Yeah, I hated it. - And he hated you coloring the grass blue and the sky green. What happened to her? What happened to that girl? You've been recreating yourself ever since you left here. Your name, your hair, your accent. - You told me that there was nothing here for me but trouble. You said "Go, do better, be better. "Go find yourself a good man and give me some grandbabies". - I ain't say forget who you were! I ain't tell you to be ashamed of me, I ain't tell you be ashamed about where you from. - I'm not ashamed of you. - Oh please, stop lying. I see how you look at me. [dramatic music] I gave you the better parts of me so you could do better. But don't get it twisted. Those were my parts that made you. You don't have to go running around here pretending you're somebody else, your stock is good. - I know, Momma. - Then act like it. I don't know whatever you're getting ready to do next. I'm gonna love you to the grave, 'cause that's what mommas do. But you hear me good. You are Karena Renee Sampson, blood in and skin out. You can run from it if you want to, but it'll always find you. [dramatic music] - Breathtaking, right? You know, I know I'm in the business of selling art, but I swear I don't want to let her go. I have more of her in the back. [dramatic music] Here we go. - Seems like you found your Mona Lisa. [chuckling] - Nah, I'm more of a Picasso man myself. Some of his greatest works were inspired by the women he loved. You know, I still don't know what I'm gonna call this series. - Call it... My wife. - Oh, you're the architect. Yeah.

I'm really proud of you. Okay, bye. - I'm glad you decided to come a day early. I'm surprised, being it's the anniversary. I was married for a couple of years, but it's hard to be with people like us. - Us? - Leaders, game changers. The ones that love us always have to sacrifice. It's lonely at the top. But, all worth it. I know Wren wasn't happy about you leaving. What did you have to do to get her to chance her mind? Ah, wait a minute. Let me guess. Upgrade on the ring? New handbag? - Nah, nah. She's not like that, you know. Believe it or not, Wren is always looking out for me. - I guess you're one of the lucky ones. So, I emailed our itinerary. As soon as we land, we'll have to hit the ground running. Meetings with the board, meeting after meeting, work, work, work.

You were gonna tell me something. - Oh, yeah. I haven't been honest. - Yeah, well, I... - No, there's more. I like beer. And I prefer my hair curly. - Hm. - I do get jealous. And I smoke sometimes. I lost my virginity at 16, not 25. And I feel like shit that I can't give you any kids. - Stop. I can't stand to see you cry. - I'm hoping that you know that I didn't miss him.

Love really appears when it's tested. It's being stupid together, and embracing the imperfections. But I think Miss Ruth definitely said it best. Marriage is like dancing to a never ending song. Just take your partner's hand, and work really hard to stay on the same beat. But when you fall off, and you will, the key is to just keep moving,hold on tight, and dance.
