MY MAN Was that a dirty look? No, it wasn't. Ever thought of getting paid for it? By whom? By men. Men who wanted you. I don't want more men. One's enough. And how! That's her loss. You're missing a treat! Where are these men? I don't see any! Come with me. I've got a nice spot. They all know where I am. We'll hustle. You and me both, we'll hustle. It's a cinch, you just smile. Can you smile? Sure I can. There. This is where I spin my web. Just settle in and wait. Is being a hooker fun? Joy. Pure joy. -Don't kid me! -I'm telling you! I don't know you, you're swell but… "Is being a hooker fun?" Listen to her! Do I look unhappy? You look like a real floozy! My name's Marie Arbath. Profession: prostitute. I'm not ashamed to broadcast it. I've got a happy mind, and a happy ass. And a healthy bank balance. I'm Gilberte. Just another housewife. You like cock? Why do you ask? You're a hustler now. To hustle, you gotta like cock. Don't play cute. -You want a man? -Yes. -Then say it. -I do! Look at that get-up! You're dressed for church! A woman needs air. So men can buzz around her. Here's one now. What? A man. A fella. A night owl kind of fella. Where's this fella? Shut up. I can't see him. I hear him. You hear him too. Listen to his footsteps. You're right, it's exciting. Get ready to quiver. I hope he's not ugly. A man's never ugly if you look at him right. Good evening. Good evening, sir. Good evening. Don't you like whores? Sure I do. Then take your pick. I'm getting there… Almost there… Ogle faster! I'm paying a babysitter. This is Mona… That's your name now. You're her first customer. Do good by her. Are you part time? Grab him as soon as he nibbles! Don't let him go soft. C'mon, honey. Come with Mona. The hotel's that way! Ask for the key to room 12. Hey, what do I charge? Forget that! Put some feeling into it. I won't do it for nothing! Not for nothing, for the pleasure. Don't keep him waiting! How narrow minded! Such lack of ambition! Money! You'll rake it in… Make him happy before counting your money! What I sell is love. Real love. True love. With me, they hear great music. Let me take you apart… You'll never be the same again. It's on the sixth floor. Don't be a wild man. People live here. Climbing the stairs is the best part, right? It feels like the first time. Stop it, please. I'm asking you to stop. I can hear your heart pounding. Mine's pounding too. -You feel we're almost there? -Yes, I do. Do you feel the warmth coming from my bed? Yes, I do. One more flight and we're there. Now wait! We need protection. I'll put it on. You're really turned on! Because of me? -You bet! -You won't squirt on me? Want to come in my hands? It'd be a pity… Some girls, everything they touch starts to spurt. I was born with a talent. To make sap flow. Even in the fall, leaves grow. It's spring all year. You got a heart problem? I worry a heart'll conk out on me. Come along, sir. Don't flag, we're almost there. I've got some cookies. We'll have a snack. First, I'll take a nice long pee. You settle in while I pee. You're not deaf? Can you hear? Settle in while I pee. Sure he can hear. He hears very well. Now come along. I know it's not proper, but come along. I'm giving you a treat… First, show me your wallet… How much will you pay for my lost virtue? One thousand? Two thousand? You give me the notes, and I'll play the music… My name's Marie… Don't forget… Marie… My only problem's my dirty mind. Next time we'll make love, I promise. Careful going down. Don't fall. Don't go break a leg… I like you old guys. You're hard work, but I like you. I'm moved by a man with his life behind him. All those lost loves, with only death ahead. Watch your step! You sit him in your armchair, you pose for him… A few nice poses… You whisper a few naughty things in his ear… and a bird comes alive in your hand. This one's not coming alive! Yes, but I'm elderly. It's been an hour! Of what? An hour of titillation. That's not flattering. I'm getting nowhere today! Neither am I! So I noticed. You're going into the closet. -Into the closet? -Yes, into the closet. What for? I don't want to go in there! But you're going to! Be good! Marie'll be right back. Wait! We forgot the condom! We forgot the condom! -Why did you bite me? -So you put on your condom! You put it on! Sure I will… There… -Now can I screw? -Yes, hurry! Don't stop! Now it's my turn! You can come? Of course I can come! Did I make you come? Guess so. It wasn't the Pope! You're fabulous! Save the comments for another day. Someone's waiting. I haven't even paid you! I should pay you! I hope he isn't dead. You're sweet to come back and see me. I was feeling a bit low… I thought, no one's interested in me… No one loves me anymore. I'm not kidding. Maybe you were just passing by… I'd like to… I'd like to climb the stairs again. Don't you want your flowers? Your bosses are bastards! Tell them! Poor guy! You can't sleep there. A rat'll bite you! Hey! Don't stay there. There's rats! There's always rats by garbage cans. Go sleep in the arcade. There are nice spots there. -Got an spare change? -What? Got any spare change? Spare change? I've got no spare change! Only big bills. Spare change… For tomorrow morning… For a coffee, a snack. You ate today? A sandwich. And yesterday? A sandwich. Just my luck… Please, lady… Spare change… Spare change for an old pal… Come to my place, I'll heat something up. What was that? Come to my place. I'll heat something up. I've got some veal stew left. Sound OK? With a shot of red wine? Thanks, lady. Don't eat the bread, eat the meat. I can soak the bread in the sauce. It's good sauce. The wine's good, too. It's quality. Don't you want to… take off a few coats? I never take my coats off. They get swiped. While you sleep, guys swipe 'em. Got a cup of coffee? I'll make you some coffee. Thanks, lady. Don't forget my spare change. Thanks, it was really kind of you. Where'll you go now? Find a spot to bed down. You want to sleep here? Where? My place. In a corner. At least you'll be warm. Go by the radiator. I won't say no. Look… Look. It's all yours. Don't you want some love? I'm a very gentle girl… They say screwing me drives men wild. Don't you want to suffer a bit? You gonna shut up? I asked if you're gonna shut up. Yes. I'll shut up. Turn over on the bed. What way? Dog-style. Yes. Right away. There. I'm ready. Now don't move. Shut up. Yes. Got a condom? In my purse. Come… Beg for it. I'm begging. What are you begging for? To be fucked by you. I'll fuck you later. Now, I'm smoking. I said, I'm smoking. I mean, really! Enjoyed the smack? I loved it. What's your name? Marie. I can't remember my name. I think it's Jeannot, but I'm not sure. I'm not sure who I am… But I think I'm a whore. Come get fucked instead of blabbing. I want to see some skin. Want some more? No thanks. I'd rather wait a while. Go get me a bottle. A bottle of what? Wine. Why'd you put on your nightgown? So you'll want to stay. So you'll feel at home. You want to be my pimp? Your pimp? Yeah. Then I'd belong to you. What do you mean by pimp? I give you everything I earn. I make a grand a day. If I tried, I could make double that. I get all the dough? All of it. What if you need some? I'll ask you for it. And if I refuse? You'll be a real pimp. A pimp's a bastard. He beats his woman! You'll be a nice pimp. A caring pimp. Who takes me to the fights. Who gives gifts. Who remembers birthdays. It's a bum deal. I have to think it over. Right, think it over. While I show you what a woman in love is like. It'll help you think it over. I love you. What was that? I love you… Could you say it again? Sorry, I didn't get it… You mumble. I want hot croissants for my Jeannot! I've made the coffee… I'll treat you like a king. Life on a silver platter. Sorry, ladies. The man in my bed may run out on me! You want croissants? Poor girl's pale as a sheet. Once, I'd screwed myself blind… Thank you for the happiness, for the gift. For this break that may not be one… What's going on? You're Marie Arbath? Yes. Prostitute? Yes. Why are you a prostitute? Is there a law against whoring? No one forced me into it. It's my calling. I like money, I like men, and I like selling dreams. Pimp! The joy of those first steps in the morning… To be freshly shaved… Leaving a trail of eau de cologne… Clean shorts every day… Spotless shoes… Marie… What a great little woman. You know this man? You're asking me? Sure I do. He's my man! You know about his past? Screw his past. I like his skin. Every inch of it. Back already? What about your stroll? When we're apart, you haunt me. Get used to it. Toughen up. I can't manage. I knew you'd be dressing. I wanted to watch. I have to go to work, Jeannot. Work… While I spend all day on the street! Hi, Jeannot! Like an espresso? An espresso… Easy, Jeannot. Take life as it comes. Listen, miss. I love my wife, but if you flash those great tits at me… I'll lose control. Please close your blouse. Sorry. It's company policy. Where are you taking me? To lunch? I only have a half-hour break. That'll do fine. How much you want to earn? 1 000? 2 000? I don't get paid. You should be. A girl like you should get paid. You don't want my money? -I didn't say that… -What did you say? Nothing… Not a thing… But you are a bit hot for me, right? Sure… Now, suppose… I stroke you inside your panties… How does that feel? I love it… Good. Things are picking up. She's a nice kid. I'll call her Tangerine. Tangerine suits her. Tangerine! My name's not Tangerine. It is for me. It's a juicy name: that's good for business. What business? "What business?" What a question! Look what I brought you. Count it: there's 5 000 francs. That's your price, sweetheart. That's what I'll pay you. If I had more, it'd be yours. Well? How does it feel to be a whore? I'm asking you a question. You'd never considered it before we met? Really? You never had? Right now… are you considering it? You are, right? They all consider it! But they need a little push. May I help you across? -I can manage fine by myself. -I'll protect you. I have a way with cars. It's child's play now. Look, you're already on the other side. Thank you, sir. Don't mention it, lady. -Admit it's a fun way to meet. -Yes, great fun. -Good morning. -Good morning, sir. -I'd like a room with a large bed. -I'll see what's available. Some guys have a gift. Me, it's my cock. It obeys instantly. When I tell it to perform, it performs. Women appreciate that. Am I right, darling? You still want me? Do I still want him! Let's make a deal. It's important. What deal? Kick me out when you're sick of me. Say the word and I'm gone. I promise. But for now we're fine. I hate being a pimp. You're not a pimp. I hate it. Don't argue! I'm a nice pimp. A very nice pimp. -Have I smacked you yet? -No, you haven't. So take that! You didn't expect it, eh? No, I didn't. Learn when to expect it. Now, watch… You feel it coming? -Yes, I do. -Then duck. Evasive action! Look… Now you sock me. Again! You didn't even touch me. But I touched you! And again! Dodge 'em! Watch for it, or you'll get bruised. Am I hurting you? If I am, I'll stop. Tell me. I'm OK. My love… Don't say I scare you. Not at all. A pimp has to hit or he's no pimp. Shall I put on some music? It'll calm us down. What kind of music you got? I've got some Vivaldi… Or Barry White. OK, Barry White. Still want me as your pimp? Still want me as your whore? Don't wreck my equipment! We may need it. You guys live up to your name! You humble me before the woman I love! Which one do you love? Up yours, dickhead! What did he say? He said nothing! Keep your ass on that chair. Know your ass? You live off it! -Be polite! -Why? We're all trash here! Are you nuts? And who's she? -Another one. -Another what? One of your pal's chicks. Sit down! I knew it'd please you to dine out. You always know how to please me. I look for new ways. Don't tell me which ones. Lots of things are going to change. Change how? From top to bottom. Really? All this is fine… Our partnership's fine, but some things bug me. How have I displeased you? I did something wrong? I need a room of my own. A place to park myself. While you're working, I roam from bar to bar. I got nice duds, a nice watch, but I'm on the street all day. We'll move to a bigger place. Why didn't you say so, love? Does my love want to move? Yes, I'd like that. Then I could come and go. I'm a whore in love! Is that a crime? Can't a whore curl up with a man after a day's work? All I know how to do is make love. I can't get enough of it. Is that my fault? I pay my taxes! At home, I can live with a man, love him, and give him the dough I earn with my ass. Then you admit that Mr. Jean Bourdelle lives with you and you support him? This is a lot better. Now I can keep myself busy. Care for a drink? Whisky? Champagne? Tea? Mind walking the dog, I think he needs to… Hurry up! My snack's waiting. -Morning, Mr Hervé. -Morning, my friend. How's our little bird? Where were you, you naughty boy? It's been months. I thought you were dead. No, quite the contrary! Was Monsieur satisfied? Take off the body stocking! I'd greatly improved her working conditions. We'd moved up in the world. Your coffee and sweetener. Look at that! So lovely! Breathtaking! Monsieur will have a ball! I bet you have a hard on. Me? Not at all. What do you mean? You're stiff as a rod! It's a sexy show! Then screw her! Don't wait till you're my age! I screw her all the time! Yes, but I'm not there to watch! I like to watch! Watch that pearl get off! I bet she comes like an angel! Please, my friend. Put on a show… Don't make me do that again! He didn't touch you. He just watched. Never again, OK? Jeannot, this is my key. The key to my place. I want it to be in your pocket. Come anytime, no need to phone or knock. I'll wait for you every day. Those were the good old days. Full of beauty and tenderness… Soft and curvaceous… Marie… Tangerine… Melissa… who'll be here any minute. Why does great happiness have to end? Who does it bother? Of course, I had to deliver. They say pimps don't work! But they have to ream! Right now I have a free moment… I'm mending a bra, my roast's in the oven, I wanted to go out for a beer. Not a chance. I have to ream again. Can't you see I'm busy? Can't you put on a robe? Why are you looking at me? Why do they all look at me? That's Melissa. See? I'm a hunted man. I could duck out… But that's too easy… With all the unemployment, it's immoral to turn down work. Especially if you love your job. Why do I give in to him? You also admit you gave Mr Bourdelle 109,000 francs to buy a deluxe Fiat coupé which he gave to Miss Sarah Vezaian. I don't know a Miss Vezaian. A gift? A gift for Tangerine. Is it big or small? You gotta look for it. How exciting! What can it be? It's waiting for you. In the jewelry store? Not there… But that's where I got the key-ring. Jeannot, is it a car? Well… it has a key… Which one is it? I want all men to enjoy you… to possess you… Know what a procurer is? He's not one! When we met, he was starving, cold, too weak to stick out his hand. So you gave him yours? -My what? -Your hand. I had so much, he had nothing. So we shared. He didn't even know about my whoring. All he wanted was food and warmth. Like now, you sit in a bar, it's no big deal… It's not tiring… Just look cute and wait. But I look like a hooker! No, you don't. Why think that? You're a stranger who's a bit lost, who'll be charmed if a gentleman offers her a drink. You gotta learn from life. Don't wander too far. I'll be around. Look. I'm meeting a Japanese client. I don't want to be a whore. You're right. Not even out of love for you. You're right. Don't ruin your life. This is good-bye, Jeannot. Good-bye, Tangerine. No worries. I say she won't hold out a week. But if I'm smart, I'll find a florist. What did I tell you? I'll try again. Maybe I'll manage. Give me another chance. Ask for 2000 francs. No less. I promise. Don't listen to them. They've got no case. Get me a lawyer, I'll be out in six months. -Are you Mr Michel? -Yes. I'm Tangerine. Nice little outfit. Italian? No, Simone of Paris. Simone does nice stuff. Very nice. Let's go into the bathroom. Wash your hands. To me, that's the height of intimacy: to be in a bathroom with a woman in her undies. Take off the stockings and garter belt. Bra and panties is more intimate. Take the jewelry off, too. They're a shield. I want you frail. What's with the tears? You crying? You're really crying! What is it? Was I rough? I don't want to be a hooker. You don't? No, I want to go home. I want to go to bed. Please, I'll return your money. Anyone forcing you to be a hooker? No, nobody's forcing me. Why do it if it revolts you? Answer me! I'm Lt. Marvier, Vice Squad. Who's forcing you to hustle? What's his name? Miss Vezaian, repeat for Miss Arbath, who seems confused, what you said about your relations with Mr Bourdelle. No. I can't… -Why not? -I can't. Read Miss Vezaian's statement. "Sarah Vezaian, 40 Flower Walk, Lyon." "Occupation: manicurist." Question. "How long have you know Mr Bourdelle?" Answer: "Six months." Question: "When did you become his mistress?" Answer: "The first day." Question: "Before meeting Mr Bourdelle…" Know any lawyers? Of course I do. You sure your lawyer is coming? He said he'd come, so he'll come! You still trust men, now? Look, I'm with you, but you're not my friend! You cling to me, but I can take care of myself. -Don't get excited. -Who's excited? My guy's in stir, but I'm calm. Hey, pinhead, pour us another. -If you ask nicely. -I'm asking nicely. How about joining forces? Can't you see we're worried? So are we. Everyone's worried nowadays. Fuck off, you bore us! Two whiskies. I said fuck off! You deaf? No man will ever touch me again! How am I gonna earn a living? Can you tell me that? How am I gonna live? We'll miss him, huh? We won't miss him. I'll miss him! Me! You're gonna forget him. OK? You never knew him. I knew him! I took him in! I gave him everything! And I'm left holding the bag. Where's that goddam lawyer? He's ditching us too? Why don't we beat it? To do what? Live. Without him? I'm cold without him, don't you see? Freezing. What'd you do before? Before what? Before you met him. I waited for him. I was a hooker. Every girl waits for the right man. The right man… That dumb shit! He's in jail. And he can stay there. So he can't hurt people. He made me feel good. Me, too. Too good. Mustn't make a woman feel too good, she goes nuts. How'd you get to be a hooker? Answer me! How did you do it? I tried hard, and couldn't make it. Let's go to a church. A church? What for? You got a better idea? Come on, don't argue. We'll get some air. There's the lawyer. You're too late, we don't need you anymore. We did need you, then we talked it over and we just realized: we don't need you. Meet the girl who saved my life. What's your name? Sarah. How did she save your life? She kicked my ass! Wouldn't you like my shawl? You look cold. Thanks a lot, ma'am. Yeah, we're a little cold. Then you must get warm. I come here to get warm. Loneliness is too awful. I'll never turn tricks again! What will you do? Find a guy and give him two kids. What kind of a guy? Any kind. A nice guy, who'll be like a brother to me. I'll do the cooking, change the diapers. At night we'll watch TV variety shows. Or a good American sitcom. I like American sitcoms. It all sounds exciting. It's very exciting. But you need to find the guy. They're everywhere. Lovely little tough guys with soft hearts. Look at that one, the one who just came in. He's searching his pockets for dough to buy some coffee. He's no big spender. He's just my type. Sorry, I have to leave you. My fate is in the balance. Pockets giving you trouble? I had money for coffee, but I can't find it. -Pocket got a hole? -Yes, that's what bugs me. Here's your money. Folks like us can't waste hours over loose change. -I'm not begging. -Who said you were? -I've never begged. -I believe you. Sure, I'm out of work, but I'm looking. When I look, I usually find. Coffee, please. Want to give me two kids? I said, want to give me two kids? One after the other, or both at once? Two kids, one after the other. A boy and a girl. That means two years together. It means a lot more. I don't know you. Maybe you're a hooker. I'm a retired hooker. Why retire? Because I'm tired. Make kids for a whore? No! Two's not many. It's not a whole tribe. Who'll do it if you don't? Lots of guys would love to. I'll ask this man. Sir! My friend wants two kids. You care to make them? Absolutely! You bet! -It's you I want! -What's special about me? You suit me. You're young, handsome! A face like springtime! Be nice, I need you. I feel a bit lost. I need someone to comfort me, say sweet things. Look! He's getting attached to me. Aren't you? I mean, she's cute… He says I'm cute. Heard the news? He says I'm cute. We're in the fast lane. I'm happy! You drifting away? Leaving him alone at the bar? I can't do all the work. He has to speak up, earn his bonus. Hi. Meet my friend. Her name's Sarah. We're hand in glove. She wants kids too? You'll see. Once you get started… Marie… Marie! PRISON OK, I'm Marie if you want. You're not Marie. Why wait for me? I'm not. I live next door. I wanted air. At 8 a.m.? They release men at 8 a.m. What's up? You forget something? Get rid of that woman. I want to leave in peace. She's not hurting anyone. It's a free country. Can't I come inside a while? You sick? Shall I take you to the infirmary? Need a hand? Bourdelle won't go. You got to. Vacation's over. It's back to the grindstone. Can't I stay? The new guy's already taken over the bed. Where'd she go? Just what do you want? Do I look like I want something? Usually, when I'm sprung, no one waits for me. I hurt women, so they don't wait for me. Marie never visited me, never wrote. My letters came back marked "Address unknown". A man coming out of jail needs a woman. Unlike jail we're warm, soft, we open up. Want some hot coffee? Hot coffee? Yes, hot coffee. My house has a wooden door. The heat's on. My big bed's clean. Feel like resting? Eyeing my gray hairs? Do a few gray hairs scare you? I'll be light as a feather. When I come to you, I won't even wake you. We'll have coffee in my kitchen, then I'll drop you. Please, Mister! Don't brush me off. I've waited so long. For what? A man. A man leaving jail who needs me. I'll care for him like a husband. Your first name? Bérangère. Where's your house? Over there. This way… Come. -Is my coffee good? -Sure, or I wouldn't drink it. That creep scared me! Sorry, I'm a bit edgy. I'm edgy, too. Coffee all over your pants. Coffee all over my pants. We'll take 'em to the cleaner. Is there one nearby? Yes… there is one. I can't stand that thing! I'll run you a bath. Would you like a bath? I like everything you do. I can't go on, Marie! I'm worn out. End of the line. Jean-François Oriole! How many still waiting? At least a hundred. What a life! OK, what's your name? Jean-François Oriole. Oriole… That's a bird. A kind of blackbird? Smaller. Yellow? Yes, but with black wings and collar. You won't sit down? I will. Are you shy? Inhibited, awkward? My jobless pay is expiring. I've a family. -Your wife work? -No, she doesn't. Why not? To reduce unemployment. Sit down. I'm sitting, dammit! This is standing, this is sitting, OK? We start from that? You a big-mouth? I'm not a big anything. I came humbly, to ask for a job. Why did Jones & Jones fire you after a week? You know about that? Shouldn't I know? I should hire just anyone? Slackers, bums? I'm no bum! The computer says you are. Blacklisted, it says. Mr Yellow-plumage Oriole is blacklisted. The Jones & Jones guy is a creep. Blamed me for what I didn't do. He said: "If you screw up idling, you'll be useless for work." No one wanted me to work. -You got paid? -Sure. Then why care if there was nothing to do? -Why'd they hire me? -To collect the bonus. That's how it works, bud. Everyone screws everyone. How about your schooling? I got a THS. -And a GT 40? -I got it. And a TSE? No TSE. Sorry, I can't hire you. They quit teaching it! That's your tough luck! I want a skilled man, not a fuck-up! So beat it! Next! I'm staying. I figure I'm hired. Hey, I've got a job! Mind if I call the wife? Your phone's not cut off? Scum! Bastard! Old fart! Pus bag! I have a gorgeous wife, two glorious kids! When I come home they hug me. She watches with big, sad eyes. How can I face them with empty hands? My jobless dough runs out Monday! That means no more dignity, no hope. All you can do is slam the bastards in the mouth! You know how to panhandle? -Ever done it? -No, never. Take your hat. My hat? I'll show you with mine. Please, ladies and gentlemen, thank you ma'am, please… See? It's easy. Sorry I can't stay. I'm hosting a dinner, so I have to be there. -Give me a bit? -Of what? -Dough. -No way, go work for your money. Put your hat on, you'll catch cold. People only give to the rich, not the poor. Daddy! I tried begging, I flopped. Why? Folks thought I was kidding. They like to laugh. Me, too: when they shut off the electricity, I thought it was a gag. It wasn't? Maybe. I didn't think it was funny. You put the kids to bed. I've got things to do. Come on, kids. -Mom's got to work. -Off to bed. She'll tidy up, cook dinner. Look out, guys are mean now. Stingy as hell. Don't worry about me. In tough times, men like a bit of fun. Trouble is, can I deliver? I need a blast. I need one too. Kiss. What counts is, we're together. Us two and the kids. That we're teamed up. You feel teamed up? I've never felt so teamed up. All I ask is your love. That your love remains intact. Even if you and I hit some rough spots. When I look at your face… When I think how lucky I am to see your face… I say, whatever happens, life is a gift. What's up? You nuts? Feel like getting laid? What did you say? Feel like getting laid? By who? You? Yes, me. I need a little bread. I have none. When I do, I invest it and earn income! How much? For what? A trick. I saw you hustling. Depends on how long a trick. Say half an hour. So say 1 000 francs. Huh? What do you do for 1 000 francs? -Is that too much? -It's exorbitant! You think I'm a tourist? What's your offer? Less than half. And that depends. Maybe it's too much. So say 500. I could use 500. You an amateur? You don't like amateurs? They're not so hot. I can teach you a few things, even make you blush. 200 francs, take it or leave it. Want it for free? I never said that. I'm offering it. -In honor of what? -I like you. You're my type. A tough guy, I like tough guys. You're crazy! Cut it out! I don't know you, so scram! Elbowing pregnant women? I'm not! I'm in a jam with a hooker. -Got it in for hookers? -Hell, no! Let him be, he doesn't love love. Never badmouth hookers, got that? Never! I didn't insult them. You look like you could. I'll take you home. No more crap. Why don't guys like me anymore? I used to just snap my fingers. Hold on, I've got a big spasm. Let's sit on a bench. It's OK, it's over. You sure? I'm OK. Who's this guy? That's what I'd like to know. -A friend of yours? -I don't know him. What's he doing here? Ask him. He won't talk to me. What are you doing here, bud? He looks spaced out. He knocked, I opened the door, he sat down without a word. You lost something? Got the wrong floor? Maybe he lived here once. -Before us? -Yeah. Maybe he's lost in his memories? His memories don't seem happy. Maybe he's hungry. You want something to eat? Some leftover veal stew? -Guys, I think this is it! -What? Waters are breaking! -I'm going to bed. -Not that again! -It's not your baby! -But it is yours! Get her a cab! At every childbirth, he hides in bed. -Childbirth scares me. -Go with her! Happy labor! Have we got things to say? Forgive me. Forgive me, Marie. Forgive me, women.
