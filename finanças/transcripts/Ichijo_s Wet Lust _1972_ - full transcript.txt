Though it is loosely based on the life of Sayuri Ichijo, the queen of strippers, this film is fiction. Right, right, right? My song: I have no luck, haven't I? Girls have no balls, don't they? We were in bed, were we? We were a good match, weren't we? This song is kinda long, isn't it? You became pregnant, didn't you? A child in your belly, right? Your parents got mad, didn't they? So we got rid of it, didn't we? We cried together, didn't we? And ran away, didn't we? This song is really long, isn't it? We slept soundly, didn't we? The stars were shining, weren't they? I got a wallet but it's empty. Right, right? On with the song. It's friggin' long, right? Now for the girl. The song of the middle. In the middle of the head, the forehead In the middle of the face: the nose. On the back: the spine. On the leg: the knee. In the middle of the belly: the bellybutton. Three inches below there are three temples. 1. Fuzztemple, 2. Perltemple, 3. Hole-Temple. In there is a monk with a head-band. He goes in and out, in and out. And then the tears of joy fall. Plop! Plop! Plop! Halleluja! - Quit it already! - Oh. come one... Strippers also eat noodles? Aren't they allowed to do so? They're ordinary people. They eat everything. Don't make me laugh. Why should someone so ordinary appear on TV, just like that? The station asked me to do it. That's not weird, isn't it? Are you trying to start a fight? - I don't like it when strippers act all important like that. - Miss Ichijo... - Yes? He's one of them. Watch out. - You there. - Yes? - If you're trying to start a fight with me, we'll go outside. We're a disturbance. Sayuri Ichijo quit, opened a Sushi-Restaurant and is awaiting the verdict in a lawsuit regarding scandalization and indecency. ICHIJO SAYURI - WET DESIRE Harumi was born in Kyushu, in a cave in a mountain, near the coal mine of Chikuho. When she was seven or eight, she danced at the Obon Festival. When she was nine or ten, her desire awakened. When she was fifteen, she danced in bed. HANSHIN-TRAIN-STATION, NODA She found a lover, a stud, she was fertile. Mom, dad, I just did what you also once did. Harumi, who do you like better, him or me? What am I supposed to do? While he was in prison, the two of us got together. Of course I like you, but he was first. I want you to talk. I didn't think he'd get out so fast. Say it, who do you like better? - Are you retarded?! I like you both. And that's why I'm asking you to talk to each other. Okay? Wait here, alright? He's quick-tempered and unpredictable but here, in front of everybody, you're safe. I'll go and greet my boss. Morning. Good Morning! I just arrived. I'm really grateful that you'll employ me again. Thank you! Do your best! Are you working alone now? No, my husband is getting out of prison today. There are a few problems. I'll take my luggage away. That idiot! He ran way! Why? It's nothing. Coffee. Cold coffee. Harumi! Long time, no see, eh? I've caused you worries. It's been so long... Are you crying because of me? Congratulations of getting out. Thanks. Are you this happy? Because of me? Thank you! How nice! Being free is nice, isn't it? Being free is nice, isn't it? I've been thinking about this for three years! Being free is so nice! - Oh, stop it already. This smell! The smell of a woman! - It's like a dream! - Stop it! It's too hot! Someone might see us. Go and say hi to your boss. I'd have though of that myself! - Did you watch us? - It was unavoidable! - You exchanged them nicely. - Well... Men are all the same. He doesn't look like a murderer. Usually he behaves himself. Listen! Something interesting happened. - About the mirror. - What about it? - Was it you? - I just asked you what about it! You used to be here and then went away, right? - Yes. - You wrote on it. - No. I didn't do anything. Look! WATCH OUT FOR SAYURI ICHIJO "Watch out for Sayuri Ichijo". Nonsense! Why should I write something like that. But isn't that how it is with Miss Ichijo? I have no idea how often I thought of you in the slam and did it myself. No matter what I was doing, as soon as I thought of you, I couldn't take it anymore and ran to the toilet. But in prison one can see everything that happens on the toilet. Don't tell me anymore about prison, alright? What's the matter? I never told anyone, but my father was sentenced to death. What? Seriously? So, when you tell me about prison, you remind me of him and I can't take that. Sorry but when I think about that I can't do it anymore. - Can't do what anymore? - Isn't it obvious? This. Hey, that's cruel! Now that I'm finally here! You started about prison. But I didn't know about that! That's the first I hear about it. Another thing: I didn't want to think about prison all the time, so I found myself another guy. - What are you saying?! - Don't get mad, ok? I couldn't bear thinking about it! - You... - He was just a replacement for you! I my heart of hearts I was always doing it with you! - Goddamn slut! - Don't get mad! I'm so sorry! As soon as I heard that you'll get out, it was over. - Whore! I won't forgive you! - Please! I'll do anything for you, I'll grant your every wish! I couldn't bear being reminded of my father. I am the daughter of a man who was sentenced to death. Please understand how I felt! Please? Whore! - Please... - Alright. I'll let it rest for today. Whore! Being free is so nice! But say, what kind of guy was he? Doesn't matter. You're the only one for me. Don't talk about it again, ok? Hurry or I'll be late! Sayuri! You're hot! - Wonderful! - Oh yeah! My sandals! My sandals are gone! - Hurry! - The president! Idiot! The president! In the middle of the head, the forehead. In the middle of the face: the nose. On the leg: the knee. Aha! So it was you after all! What of it? Don't act so innocent. There was a lot of trouble. Why? Oh, just stop! Why are you keeping it a secret? What? I have no idea what you're talking about. Help! Help! Sorry. It's hot, isn't it? - Should I help you? - Thanks but that's not necessary. Your show is excellent. I read the book about you. I'm just like you. I grew up in the orphanage. In the book it said there was a bath house near your orphanage. And that you always longingly watched as the children went to the bath with their parents. This story really touched me. Is it at all possible that this orphanage was in Saitama, near Omiya? Yes. It said so in the book as well. What, really? Maybe it was the same orphanage. My experiences were the same. I lived in an orphanage called Seifu-En. Is that the same as yours? Yes, I was in Seifu-En. What, really?! So you're my predecessor. I totally admire you. I have to tell you something... Maybe you heard that I played tricks on you. But I've done nothing like that! That's the truth! I really, really admire you. I don't like to be reminded of the past. And I can't get changed like that. Would you mind going outside? How inconsiderate of me. Sorry. Thanks. Shall we cool our heads? Hurry! What's up? I want you to really give it to her. Who are you talking about? Sayuri Ichijo. Why? What happened? I can't stand her. Idiot! I can't do something like that. - Something terrible happened to me. - What? She treated me like shit. Don't talk bullshit, not now! I'm supposed to do her? Wouldn't you be jealous? Of her? Why should I? You could also kill her. Cry. Cry. It's alright. Promise me to do her good and proper. OK. I'll do it! Do her! - Fuck her, alright? - I will! Fuck her! "Shibata" "All Night Shibata." Go to hell! SAYURI ICHIJO DUE TO ILLNESS NO PERFORMANCE TONIGHT Mari! Come on, let me touch you! Did you feel it? Harumi! Come here! Are you finished? Mari! Come here! Damn! It's true! - You're police? - You're clever. It's hot! It's so hot today! Damn! It's really true! Mr. Policeman, don't you think it's kinda strange? Are you listening? Why would you arrest small fish like me? Why not a bigger star? Are you listening? Something must be up! Coincidentally, Miss Ichijo isn't here... No way she is really sick! - Something's fishy here! - Don't talk nonsense! - Damn! - Let's go! We're leaving. Hurry! You mustn't cheat on me, OK? OK. Or I'll castrate you! Hurry up already! I beg you! Two, three more minutes! What are you doing in there? A little ritual. If I don't finish it'll be bad luck. Hurry up! I'll be done soon! Come on! You're listening to his ritual? Well, I'm waiting outside. Come on, hurry up! Yeah. Yeah! Faster! I'll be right there! I'll be right there... Right, right, right? On with the song. It's pretty long... It's hot! Really hot today! Three inches below there are three temples. 1. Fuzztempel, 2. Perltemple,... It's ridiculously hot! 3. Hole-Temple. In there is a monk with a head-band. Hey! Wait! And then the tears of joy fall. Plop! Plop! Plop! Why are they putting us in here? Because you fought back! Your incessant "Something's fishy!" pissed him off. What's the use repeating something useless? Resisting the police only works to your disadvantage! If we want to keep working, we mustn't antagonize the police! Got it? Wow, as soon as I'm quiet you start holding a sermon. Don't be so cheeky. It was the same with Miss Ichijo! Why are you always rebelling? It's useless! Come on! Time to wash your faces. I don't get why you're rebelling against Miss Ichijo. - Wash yourself! - No! - You're rebelling again! - Shut up! I'm no longer working with you. What? Right now?! Don't cause even more trouble! - Stop it! - Idiots! What are you fighting for? Hurry! You too! Fuck! They're asking for a 30.000 Yen fine! What bullshit! I'll quit the lesbo show. What?! What else do you wanna do? The candle show. Sayuri Ichijo can't have it all. What are you saying?! You're gonna starve to death without the lesbo show! Lesbo stuff is just for talentless hacks. I've never said anything before, but the smell of another woman's cunt makes me wanna puke. What?! My own is bad enough but another woman's is unbearable! - What are you saying? - I'd rather die, than endure cunt stink again! What are you talking about? And how is it with you? I got sick too! You're the exception, huh? You're stinking a thousand times worse! Shut up! Fighting doesn't solve any problems! Don't talk such bullshit, talk reasonably! It's the same with all bitches. They all stink! - Are you gonna let them fight? - Go smell yourself! We'll all be pennyless! She isn't listening. Idiot! That's exactly your job! Once she's pissed she won't back down, trust me. Yeah? If that's how it is I'll use my connections. - Nobody will hire you ever again! - Please do your best! I've had it! You get sick? How can you say that?! You asked me to do the lesbo show with you! - Right! - You forgot that? You asked me too, dammit! People change over time. It's all your fault, cunt! Daikichi! He hit me! That guy hit me! Don't just stand there and gawk! He hit me! - That was no good. What were you thinking, beating another man's woman? What? Damn! Asshole! "Mifune" CLUB MIFUNE Harumi was born in Kyushu, in a cave in a mountain, near the coal mine of Chikuho. When she was seven or eight, she danced at the Obon Festival. When she was nine or ten, her desire awakened. When she was fifteen, she danced in bed. She found a lover, a stud, she was fertile. - He's sorry. He told me to excuse him. - I see, I see. When he loses it, he no longer knows what he's doing. But he's a good, honest man. He's worried how you are. He told me to take care of you. I see, I see. It's my responsibility as well. So I agreed to do it. But you didn't tell him about us? Are you nuts? Of course not. Why would I do that? Understand my feelings, she said. She left both her love and her home. And boarded the first train. She arrived in... SHIMADA DRUGSTORE ...in Osaka, at the Hanshin train station in Noda. They don't have anything for burns. - But they should! When I was little there was this toad oil... They don't have that. - But they should! - They don't have it! It used to be sold at the Summer Festivals. They don't have it! 4-6, 5-6, how can you tell the difference? There are four toes in front, six at the rear. That's the 4-6-toad. If you rub in that oil neither hot water nor liquid candle wax will hurt in the least. Okay? I'll start. Owww! Hot! Everything OK? Yeah, it's no big deal. Go on! Owwww! That feels... strange. Further down. Do it further down! That feels strange. That's enough! Hold me tight! - Good. - Hold me tight! I love you. AMIHIKO "Amihiko" - Twerp. I came out like you wanted me to. What now? You're tenacious. Stop torturing strippers and go back to your swamp! - What? I don't have to listen to that! ICHIJO SUSHI Good day, welcome. - I can't take it! - What's the matter? There's a drunkard out there who's molesting me. No clue why! You should've expected that. These things happen. Don't make a fuss about it. Hot today, eh? Here I am. Sake. The best! Welcome! Understood. The best! Listen, I'm here because your boss wants to tell me something. - What do you want to do now? - What happened? Your wife wants something from me, that's why I came. I don't want anything from you. You're just trying to start a fight. That sounds quite different from what she said outside! She said I should go back to the Kamagasaki swamp. Maybe she's acting like that because she was on TV. You're a stripper, I'm from Kamagasaki. That's no laughing matter. If you want, I'll go. I'll go. But if I ask around... I'm sure I can round up a couple boys who'll tear this place apart. Really, right away. Idiot! I'm arrogant because I was on TV? You said strippers mustn't eat noodle soup. Aha? Why should they be forbidden to do that? That's why I got mad and said what I said. - Come on, tell me why strippers aren't... - That's enough! Say that again! I'm a guest in your restaurant! What kind of behaviour is that? Oh, all guests are treated like this in this place? That's the peak of impoliteness. What do you say about that? HIGH- AND DISTRICT COURT OSAKA On August 9th Sayuri Ichijo was found guilty and sentenced to six months forced labor. Look! - And? - It doesn't work. - Not at all? - Not at all. Look! That sucks. Stop it! Just look at it! I think something came out! No, it isn't! I can't watch this! Just look at it! Oh! Do that again! Pretty good! - Really? - Yeah. But it won't work with that expression. Why? That expression kills any boner. True. Try to look sexy. Smile! And try to look ecstatic! - A bit more... - Shut up! It's too difficult. I like that. That's exactly what I like about you! You're annoying! Sorry! Go! Understand my feelings, she said. She left both her love and her home. And boarded the first train. She arrived in Osaka, at the Hanshin train station in Noda. Halleluja, halleluja! They said you'll quit. You have dedicated fans all over Japan, from coast to coast! Please tell me why you want to quit. Well, the opportunity presented itself... And also I don't want to go against the law. That's why. - Thanks! - You're welcome. Please Mrs Ichijo... You won't be dissuaded? No way. Good morning! It's such an honor to participate in your final performance! But are you really serious about quitting? That's such a pity! Your fans will be in tears! But you're busy. I'll come back later. Wait a second! You show your guests things that ordinary women are ashamed of. What do you feel when you do that? I'm ashamed as well. You enter a certain state of mind. I think that's the reason why your fans admire you. How do you pull that off? Are you really giving your all every single time? You're totally serious every single time? Yes. I'm totally serious. Every single time. - You're totally honest, every time. - Exactly. Miss Ichijio! This is an important show. So, no jokes please. But sister Ichijo! Did you really think that of me? That's mean. - My apologies if I'm mistaken. - You are! - Well then, until later. - Take a picture! - Miss Ichijo! Don't copy the candle show! Hey! What's up? - I've had enough! - What happened? Hey! - What's the matter? It's too hot! - Pah! Who had sex yesterday, in this same heat? - Not my fault! What's the matter? - Don't chase me! That bitch! Seriously! Yes! Sayuri! You came today, just for my show from Kyushu and also from Hokkaido. For that I thank you with all my heart. - Don't stop! - Keep going! My family name is Ichijo, my first name Sayuri. Thank you for attending my goodbye performance and for coming from so far away. This will be my final performance. I'm sure there will be parts that still aren't perfect. But please overlook those, and stay until the end of the show. Those among you who are familiar with Mister Komada's book probably know that I lost my parents when I was little and grew up in an orphanage. My marriage went to pieces and I got pregnant. I even tried to commit suicide. That I now may stand on this stage, which is my home... Nowadays, too, children and the disabled have to be cared for. Take pity on them and fill the donation box. You paid a lot for the entrance ticket and now I'm also asking for donations. Please forgive me. But this is my last performance, and I really beg of you. Many thanks from all my heart. Thank you so much. - I thank you with all my heart. - Good luck! Everything I told you was a lie. Listen. I never was in an orphanage. Why did you do it? Even that my father was sentenced to death was a lie. I wish I was dead! Hey! Don't talk such nonsense! Pull yourself together! I'll kill you! She used the bloom of her youth, in order to make a living. On her tense body burns a crimson peony. A woman's pride... It's so hot that I lost my mind. And despite her burning red pride... In the end... Japan's Nr. 1! ...trembles with wet black hair... ...a crimson peony. Sayuri! You're the best! Your unfulfilled... I want you to do it with me. And? Was it good? Can you see it? It's my last performance. That's why you can watch. For goodbye. And? Watch out, if you get too close you'll get stuck. And? Was it good? Thanks! I've got to go back. Stop. I've got to go back. Stop it! If I miss my performance I'm in deep shit! I mustn't miss it! That's embarrassing. Mister. Mister. Help. Mister, you're looking so sad. When I was little, I lived at an orphanage. My father often visited me. But when he left he always had a sad face. When I think of that I want to give a special present to someone like you. Does that make you feel as if you're comforting your father? - Maybe. As if you'd show it your father? Yes. That's pretty crazy, eh? - And that's why you're so wet? - Indeed. My father murdered the woman he loved and was sentenced to death. There are some really weird things. Is it really possible that something like that can get one wet? - Everything OK? - Yeah! - I'll go ahead! I mustn't be late! - Okay, good! - I beg you, stop! Don't run so much with your leg! Even the seagulls, which always flock together... Even they have long forgotten it: Our love. Tonight, too, the ship's horn sounds. The ship's horn... Solitary and alone. - You're under arrest! - Let me go! You're hurting me! Let go! Let me go! -Shut up! - Let me go! -You animal! - Are you nuts?! -Arresting a naked woman! - Don't talk nonsense! I won't leave. Let me get dressed! You ain't lying? Another 30.000 Yen? Unbelievable! - Eh. - Yeah. Hurry! In the middle of the head: the forehead. In the middle of the face: the nose. In the middle of the leg: the knee. In the middle of the belly: the bellybutton. Three inches below the bellybutton, there are three temples: The first is the Fuzztemple, the second is the Perltemple, the third is the Holetemple. Mr. Policeman! You don't have to take everyone! This is a three day show. Let the others stay! Take only me! No way! - Hey, not so fast! - Let her go immediately! - Give Sayuri back! - Fuck no, you idiot! It's not cool that the police is ganging up on the weak. People pay to go to the theater. They pay to see something. Do you have a problem with that? This guy is silent as a grave. Are you even listening? What are we supposed to live from? - Stand-up Comedy? - That ain't so easy! - Really? - Can you do it? - That's enough! - What are you saying? - That's exactly it. Listen! You can't arrest everyone! We'd have to close. What would you do for us? We don't have them all. One fled with your help. No, that's not true. It's me! Answer me! Is the air in? I have to go to the toilet or I'll burst! They are still here! Pull yourself together! This is a matter of life and death! I'll come back later. Right, right, right? Here I go with my little song: I have no luck, haven't I? Girls have no balls, don't they? We were in bed, were we? We were a good match, weren't we? This song is kinda long, isn't it? You became pregnant, didn't you? A child in your belly,? your parents mad, right? What are you doing? As you can well see, everything pisses me off. What? - And I'm off. - Where do you want to go? - None of your business. - Stay here! - Shut up! - You can't leave! Can't you hear me? Wait! - Are you deaf? - No, I can hear you! Stop them, Mr. Policeman! Help! I'm dying! Harumi! Help! - Stop it! Stop! - What? What are you looking at? Harumi! Are you OK? Harumi was born in Kyushu, in a cave in a mountain, near the coal mine of Chikuho. When she was seven or eight, she danced at the Obon Festival. When she was nine or ten her desire awakened. What are you thinking? -Leech! - Stupid cow! Halleluja, Halleluja! - Mr. Policeman? - What? How often do you have to be arrested before you get thrown into jail? Mom and dad were shocked and punished her two night and three days long. Mom, dad I just did... what you did too, when you were younger. Halleluja, halleluja! Come in! Come right in! You have perfect timing! Say, do you know Sayuri Ichijo? Of course! - Did you ever see her? - Yes. Take a good look. Which one of us is wetter? Miss Ichijo or me? Incredible! You're much wetter! I'm really glad you said that! Unbelievable! Look!
