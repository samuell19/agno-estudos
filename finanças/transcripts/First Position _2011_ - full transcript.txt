Clear the stage, please. Ladies, gentlemen, please vacate the stage. I know you hear me. I know you know what it means. Clear the stage! '' The ballet competitions are the most effective '' For a candidate the dancer is seen by elite dance schools the world and other companies.'' '' Youth America Grand Prix is the ballet competition World's largest'' granted full scholarships and employment contracts dancers from 9-1 nine years.'' '' First'' position Care, Hannah. Hannah. I started dancing when she was four. I love ballet. I do not know. I just like it so ... It's hard to explain. This is an air gun. Maybe I should shoot right now. These are things Ballet Training and this is a foot extender. It hurts a lot. This one here, you're supposed to do whenever possible and then five times after flatly no longer can do. This is to help to turn around. That is right! Yes! My ballet teacher called Denys Ganio. He is French. He is very strict, but not in bad vibes. Is strict cool. It's funny. When you do something right, you really corrected. Him .. Well, sometimes it's painful. When I work with Aran, I'm not working with a 1 1 years. Pas de Bourree. Plie. If we have one or two as he in our life, it is much. I was lucky to accept my son at 20 in Ballet of the Paris Opera. Now I have to Aran and I am full. Youth America Grand Prix is coming and have been training very hard. Hopefully that will deliver results. It feels good to have worked so hard and have that mentality. Then you feel like everything hurts when you get home. Children who are engaged the ballet as a career leave much of his childhood. Do not go to parties or sleepovers and nothing unravel or those things. Not possible. Do not throw the camera. There are two babies. '' The family of Aran currently lives near a U.S. Naval Base Naples, ltaly.'' Since we are a military family, we moved a lot. Ryan finished working Bethesda and it was time to move to another place where there was ballet training. So our only option was to go to that place and try to find ballet somewhere or six months did Ryan in Kuwait. Ryan chose to go to Kuwait Six months for Aran could continue with their training. Now we are in Naples and drive two hours north to Rome to find the best training. So when you're ... when you're in the Navy. You can not ... You do not choose where to live, so ... It's a small price to pay. Rock School'', the best dance education'' Slowly. I was born in Sierra Leone, West Africa. My name was Mabinty Bangura. When I was adopted, changed it to Michaela. It is a miracle that I'm here. P. .. I can not ... I can not believe I'm here. When I was younger, I used to think I was dreaming. '' Michaela was born during the boom Civil War 1 2 years in Sierra Leone''. Wherever eye, saw someone die. There was not even a reason. My parents were killed by the rebels, so my uncle brought me the orphanage and ... I lived there. That was very good. Yes. Very well. Do you know? I think it is from the beginning leg sometimes goes, then you try, and get up and later. Do you understand the joke? In other words ... Yes, sorry ... That, returns to pass? a second. Resistance is also at the last moment, not just drop it. - Punta. - Yes! - Yes, exactly. - Oh, my God. - Big difference. - It's huge. If I'm here judging, that would be a big difference. In truth, it's huge. So we decided to make with its variation was to go beyond the limit, because it has extreme power. You can do many things. It's very athletic. Now I have to get her away Eagle and a little closer to the swan. This is me and she is Mia. We adopted the same time. I do not know how to describe it, but it was ... it was very difficult go to sleep and the other children at the orphanage were afraid that something bad happen and escaped. Michaela handled it all very well, as ... Once, I tried to save my teacher, but like I lost knowledge and cut off the arms and legs, and just left there. Then we came to the United States and all concerned for us. It was great. Good night, Mom! Good night, princesses. Good night. Good night. Elastic spend my night painting for the braces. This used underwear under their tutus, not come in dark brown. Pinto this for a brunette girl because they are all what we call flesh color. Well, white. Would you still like this is dark brown? Here? This needs to become in dark brown. A mother once told me: '' Everyone knows that girls Black can not dance ballet.'' Do they speak well because she is adopted and imagine that they feel the same for her what they feel they for their children? Or so they say because, in reality, are so insensitive about race? '' Love, Family'' We always wanted a large family and I said to my husband: '' Why not adopt '' An African country affected by war? No one deserves to be caught in a war zone.'' We were in the process to adopt Mia and said:'' There's another girl '' And can not find a family for her '' Because he has vitiligo, '' Has pigmentation '' And everyone is afraid of adoption, '' Because they thought it was Devil girl because of its spots.'' He said:'' Oh ... Well, we can adopt it.'' I said,'' Yes, I thought so.'' That's how we had to Michaela. I remember when I was six, had her first recital and he said: '' Mom, you see my spots?'' I said:'' No, not at all. No notice''. She said:'' Oh, that's good.'' He said:'' I just wanted to make sure '' Because if you can not see from the audience then I know that I can be a professional dancer.'' At the orphanage, I found a magazine with a ballerina en pointe in a pink tutu. I kept it and I thought, if I ever take, I want to become something. He looked so happy. Being on tiptoe, I thought it was great. Is the only I lived for, become this person, be exactly as that dancer. Getting a scholarship is something very large. It gives you the opportunity to go to a place where you never thought to go. He takes pressure off your parents, who you are paying everything. The thing is that there are many stereotypes they say that if you a ballerina black have terrible feet, have no extension. You're too muscular. Not have sufficient grace. I would like to know as the delicate black dancer ballet dancing. '' Every year, more than 5,000 Dancers (from September 9 to 1 years) '' Enter the semifinals of Youth America Grand Prix held in most of 1 5 cities around the world.'' '' Only the most talented advance to the finals '' And compete for scholarships and valuable contracts from prestigious institutions Dance around the world.'' You have to keep working, follow, follow, follow and the day will come. A ballet competition is controversial. People do not realize how important it is fututo for a dancer. They know exactly what they want to do with your life. They need to start find work at 1 7 years. Entering at least 5,000 competition for the semifinals and only a few hundred reach the end in New York. You have five minutes on stage to prove why you deserve this opportunity and not someone else. When I'm Back the stage, I always tell '' Good luck'' or'' good job'' and I look like I'm crazy. Because people is super competitive. When I say'' good luck'' I see it as, '' Who are you? Why are you talking about?'' All evaluate each other when they arrive. You can see immediately when you enter, especially in the dressing room. Five minutes to the show. Five minutes. From 263 to 270, please out into the hallway. We are about to begin. The talent level here is very high. So it's a good place for them, because there directors from different companies worldwide and disclosed. My name is Joan Sebastian. I'm from Colombia. My dream is to be a professional dancer. This competition is very, very important to me. A scholarship can change my life. Working for my family. I remember all the time my mom telling: '' Keep going. I know it will be wonderful, the better.'' You're not jumping, 're flying, remember that. Master, can play ... and one, two, and three, and four? Working this hard. Sometimes you wake up and your body is very tired. Then you say: '' Why am I doing this?'' It's like, no, I quit. I want to go to Colombia. I want to see my family, but when you start to take class feel this magic thing you have. So it's like, no, I want ... I want to ... I really want to do this. How will you finish your variation? Well, I have to. As a dancer, I think he is very talented and I think it was made to dance. This is when I was dancing ABT. Memories to jump were without pain. One, two, three. Mine is better. Joan, leaving his family so young and coming to another country where you do not speak the language. Everything is completely different and you have to start from scratch. I can give a phone card, please. Sometimes I ask: '' How is everything?'' He says: '' Well,'' I miss my mom. It's tough. He will be responsible for helping his family, so has a great responsibility. The food is almost ready. We are, indeed, Latinos and we love beans. - And rice. - And rice. Almost every day, eat the same. Many dancers would like to have a career, but very, very, very few succeed. You must have the correct physical. You must have the correct technique. You must have a good economic situation, because the ballet is very, very expensive. Shoes, clothes, trips, inscriptions, instructors, tuition. Maybe you could buy two cars. It can cost $ 1, 500 by choreography, but winning advertising to do well competency it might be a job in a company. All the money we have paid in the last 1 0, 1 5 years you've been dancing be worth your university. Hopefully now collect the fruits, hopefully. The daily income of the study ... More private classes. Each tutu, perhaps making about 1 to 00 hours to, depending on how many layers of tulle. It is very expensive to go and buy them all the time. A well-made tutu can cost between $ 1 500 and $ 2,000. For me, is like a wedding dress. No ballet dress 1 for a girl four years. Although we live in ltaly, Aran has a manufacturer Chicago favorite costumes. These shoes premiered yesterday and almost no use. Sometimes, I try to find stronger shoes, to avoid having to spend $ 80 daily. Really, I love see them dance. I can see like five or six hours a day without getting bored at all. Many kids my age, January 00% are not sure what they want to do. I know I want to dance ballet for the rest of my life. Those people who say I'm losing my childhood ... I think I've had enough childhood and ballet sufficient until now. Let ... Leave your head. I think dancing in a company with my brother when we are bigger, that is my big goal, but it depends on him. I mean, if he wants to achieve that goal. Yes, a high pass?, above, outside. I think I'm better at ... I think I'm better at emotion. No emotion, but to smile. I knew nothing, nothing about ballet, not even the first position or nothing. Before the start Miko with ballet, sulked after his nap. I took her to ballet. Suddenly was well animated. It was, well, well happy. So I started to study to have more knowledge about ballet. If we were not a family ballet, perhaps would weigh about 4 kilos more. We would take more vacations, would see more TV. We would like a normal family. My ballet teacher, Viktor, suggested it would be good idea to study at home, so that there were more hours for ballet. So I can improve in less time. I miss my friends, because at home, only my mom and my dog. Miko, we gotta go. Otherwise, arrive late for rehearsal. Okay, Miko. Let's get ready. Show us the wild child the streets of Seville. Forward. Energy. Dynamic. Yes. Open shoulders. Perfect. Arms in first position. Up, up, up! Do not give up! Be strong! Miko is a student exceptional. Thank you. Good job. I do not see Jules is the same case. Can you plunge the stomach? You bring a suit ballet young. Can you work hard? Deal stomach. Crush your breakfast. I did not choose this variation. I want to take the blame for everything to Satoko. Dream come true. Your son is dancing now Swan Lake . A softer plie, Jules. Plie softer. Pie pointed. I run! Run, run, run, run. Final position since. Come on! Big jump! Big jump! Even bigger now. Top! In fact, reverence is the best part. Well, the good thing is that I'm not cool and he loves it. Do not tell anyone of my friends school I dance ballet, because in my old school, I said, but all began to ridicule me. Many men believe that ballet is not what it is. He is very athletic. Women have tutus and ballet flats. Men do things male. There is much energy and focus. We heard stories on children dancing entering the secondary and exit by merciless teasing and stereotypes. Until now, he is strong and understands not worth listening to to such people. I must say, I never imagined that my son was a dancer. I played baseball as a child and assumed that my son was going to do some baseball, basketball ... But it could be more proud. '' European Semifinals Youth American Grand Prix'' '' Israeli Aran and her friend, Gaya, compete in the youngest division, of 9-1 1 years''. One, two, three ... '' Today the dancers dance both variations of ballet, contemporary and classic.'' I want you beautiful. In the summer, went to an adult class and she was very scared because all They are very professional. Suddenly, we saw a child of age ... An adorable toddler and wonderful. Gaya became interested in ballet after that, I think it was for Aran. He was handsome and strong. Photo ... Two flashes at a time. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Not anymore. Number 1 4, Aran Bell, January 1st years variation Bayadere only . I was lucky to land well in the spins, because the lights ... It was all a blur. Very well. Bravo, bravo, bravo. Congratulations. Thank you. Gaya Bommer Yemini of lsrael Broncos presenting . When she dances, something in his face changed. Two different people. I see your age changing ... As age is changing. Something in the expression and concentration is changing. It becomes adult when he dances. I can not breathe. It was wonderful. She certainly will go into the final round. I hope so, after what he did. Yes, she will get something. He's cute. Then the bow. Beautiful dancers. Stuck! When Gaya hurt his foot, could not walk. When he saw Aran running, suddenly, with all the love, ran after him as if he had nothing. See what makes love people? Love happy. '' Night'' awards ceremony And the winners are ... '' Only three dancers Aran Division '' Win prizes in European semifinals and advance to the finals.'' Aran Bell. Gaya Bommer Yemini. '' They have five months to rehearse before meeting in the finals in New York''. If you dance so well and know what you are able, Rebecca could certainly win. 284, Rebecca Houseknecht, January 7 years presenting a variation ... - How was it? - It was pretty bad. Shut up. You did good! Neither saw him. Stacy saw. It was horrible. Turn around. Practices both even then one minutes on stage and you're done, that's all. No one sees all the work you put. Ballerina Princess'''' '' Princess'' I think I live a life quite normal. I go to a regular high school. I have friends at school. I have a boyfriend. I have task as all others in my school. Management. Also as. As much. I was a cheerleader last year. What a shame. This is me cheerleading. Another attempt to normal. I think that's flexible. It's pretty disgusting. Many people tell me I'm disgusting because I can do strange things as these. '' Parking princesses, '' crane is used '' Princess'' Street'' Princess'' My nickname at school is Barbie, I think because I can bend in different directions and I love the pink, I have blond hair. I started dancing just for fun but now it is much more than that. I'm working to be professional and is just ... It is a way to express, besides talk. My friends tell me as: '' Why can not miss one day at a dance class?'' They do not understand the discipline of the dancers. Do not believe it is a race or so I've been working so hard all your life. Rebecca Houseknecht. '' The second dance of Rebecca demonstrated to the judges that had the potential to advance to the final round.'' I was fully prepared for this competition, was on stage and ... For this variation in particular which is super easy for her. I said:'' This is not my Rebecca''. However, handled it pretty well. I mean, not to cut down veins. He handled it pretty well, which is a tribute maturity. It will do much better in the finals in New York, Is not it? - Yes - Yes I need to relax. Yes. You can see it in your face. Yes. Exhale and relax. That's it. That's it. It's better. It's better. Then comes the little pirouette to the arabesque position. Why can not do that with music? - Do not know. - Do not you know? Do it again. It definitely helps to have a beautiful body for ballet ... Long legs and cute, small head, beautifully arched feet, proportionate body. Tenacity is the main thing you need a dancer. I worry that Rebecca is looking for work at this particular time, because companies are laying off dancers, are not engaging them. It has everything and is ready. You just need to trust her. Michaela semifinal round'''' I have fear. There were, like, really good ... People really skinny. Ya know. Wish I was ... That green leotard. It was great. Was it like super high? Yes .. lgual and go outside. Outside? Yes, because I can not stand be here. I'm starting to give heat. Issue 1 1 4, Michaela?? Michaela DePrince, January 4 years. Dryad Will Change of Don Quixote . Bravo! Been great! It was the first time I see you dancing, my love. You were enjoying it, smiling and were doing well. No more than people the show. This is great. You danced better than ever. I was impressed. You were great. I hold my breath ... until it ends. Yes, sometimes, hold your breath almost all the time. The dance was perfect today. He was in total control. So it was ... Almost we break fingers to hold on so strong. This side and tip. Competition in the world is so great. If a girl like her, but with better feet judges and directors would take it her instead of Miko. I always joke and say: '' Miko, I'll break your foot or I'll break your wrist.'' That's what it takes because elsewhere Children are working non-stop, right? With devotion and with the idea you want to be a great dancer or a great dancer. We moved two weeks ago to be closer to the ballet. Then my husband changed his office, so workers also had to move by Miko and Jules ballet. My sons work more hours than I and work every day, to Saturday and Sunday. 's Father because well I have not the guilt'' the entrepreneur'' as my children, in fact, work harder than me. Good face, good foot. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. All right, all right, all right. Oh, my back. The other moms think I'm too involved, but I will not regret have been able to do more them. So I think I try to do best. I love broccoli. Dad, I bet I can this put me in the mouth. I bet you can. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Andale, J. J. Do it. Metellus. I have money wagered. Say:'''' Fat Bunny. Fat Bunny. I want to eat broccoli, spinach and carrots. We cheese, but is 50% less fat and 30% fewer calories. Nonfat yogurt for Miko and Jules and low-fat yogurt for my husband and me. I have very carefully to stay fit and do not get fat. When we fight and my sister I say fat, I say anorexic. But I'm not. Well, I'm not. Really, I am. I love food. Yes, she is not anorexic. Some people say I'm too skinny and I should start to get fat, but ... But you have to be skinny to dance ballet. You must have a lot of energy and for that, you need food. In fact, I think the dancers eat much. Most, I think. I do not know. We are. I think we're just thin because we burn all calories. If you did not eat, could not dance. Joan Sebastian Semifinal'''' My dream is to go to the Royal Ballet. My inspiration is Carlos Acosta. He changed everything in the world of ballet, it was the first dancer black at the Royal Ballet. For some reason, I feel something like to be Colombian. '' Joan Sebastian advances to the finals'' Semifinal Round'' Miko and Jules'' Punta. Punta. Punta. Punta. Punta. Punta. Higher, higher, higher. Number 202, Miko Fogarty, January 2 years. Urban Flower . I was thinking, Why do you fall? I screwed up both. It's my fault. No Miko's fault. What goes wrong on stage is my fault, but to be good, is for her. '' After falling, Miko will to prove to the judges should still advance to the finals.'' Miko Fogarty, January 2 years spring moments July 1 . He was as anxious all as well ... Like a bird in its cage wanting to escape. Then ... Then, yes, I did well. What I love about her, fell. Never seen before that fall well and got up and danced as if he had not fallen. It's tiny, but strong. - Right? - Yes The strongest thing in the world. I think I did very well. I think Viktor will say: '' You did better because you had an audience front of you.'' Or something negative that is supposed must be positive. You always do a good job on stage and that's important. Are you happy? Yes. Are you sure? Yes? Well, well, well, well. The way to bring their children to New York to make themselves known. '' Both Miko and Jules advance to the finals.'' '' Jules was the youngest child in their division and the judges gave another chance.'' '' Joan Sebastian returns home for the first time in over one year.'' Here we are. It is a soup with chicken. Every time we are together, always do this. This is as traditional. Oh! God. The scholarship is about $ 50,000 and the minimum wage in Colombia is $ 250 a month. J. J. stopped taking classes ballet. He said:'' I have no passion for the ballet''. I think it's difficult for my mom I quit seeing. So she asks me: '' Really, tell me the truth. Like ballet or not?''. And I say something like:'' No''. Something like that. I ... I never imagined that when leave him, I would be so sad. I like the ballet, but I never loved as my sister. I miss him dance. I saw a boy dancing Swan Lake which he danced and music ... I told his mom, you can wear the costume of J. J. So I could see. Ay, J. J. People do not realize how difficult it is to make as a dancer. You have so many injuries as professional athletes. People always think that football players lacrosse, soccer are those that are injured, but ballet dancers are injured every day and must continue working. The skin on the bottom my foot is clear, as you cut and the top of my foot scraped friction with the floor. The top of my foot starts bleeding and I get like scabs. You're working your body maximum since we have about five years. They are beautiful in ballet slippers, but when you take them off, are not as nice. They have a torn ligament or have a stress fracture and may be out for a year. Well, that can make shatter a career. Which causes further working with injuries when they should not. You make your body do things that is not supposed to do, it is not. But satisfactory. - Not natural. - It is not. If you only stay there. Feel the heat. '' Waiting Room CT scans'' When you return to dance, you will feel like you never happened. '' Three days before the end'' I have tendinitis in my Achilles tendon. I started hurting really bad. I'm doing half of what others are doing. It is very painful. Never stops hurting. It should not be competing, but do not want to ruin my career here, so ... We are three days competition and we are working with her, their eyes fill with tears and says:'' I do not think I can do it.'' If you can not, Do not. He also knows that if he does and can not do well, then what is right? Michaela! Stop. Stop. Try to keep it warm. Do not overdo it, not worth it. Maybe I should stop dancing. Maybe this is not for me. Oh, it is super cold. Okay. Right now is just bloated and it hurts a lot. I can not do anything about it. Miko, can you check everything what we have? Where did you put on makeup? Makeup goes here. Can you put makeup there? It looks good. It's cute, right? A crown. How fitting. Yes. Yes, that ... Seems to be perfect blue tutu. Will we be so lucky? I like it very much. Me too. Really, I want to see everyone dancing, especially to younger girls. I want to see if any of them is super good. Oh, my foot, now it hurts. '' Over the next week, 300 soloists worldwide will the stage.'' '' On the last day, 30 judges representing'' elite institutions ballet '' Will award scholarships contracts and medals the dancers '' promising. '' City Center in New York. Final Round'' '' International Competition ballet students. I try to think of the thing scariest I've done in my life to maintain calm and think:'' This is not so bad like that.'' However, I can not right now think of anything. Then we went to eat ... Open the stage. Come on, please. Let's see, Miko, smile, smile. Great smile, okay? Do not say anything that has to do. Teachers will. If you want to smile, should smile. If you want, you should not. Be strong, be strong, Be strong, be strong. Strive fully. Strive. Do not feel anything ... No, no, no. Open up, open. Stay, stay. Where should you stay? Opens. Strive. Strive. Feel, feel. Feel, feel. Dancers, leaving the scenario, please. We are about to begin. Please take your seats, please. Is your number? Are you 446? Are you 444? Okay. 444, Aran Bell, January 1st years presenting La Chauve-souris . It was great. Thank you. It's really amazing. I came from lsrael to New York for this competition. My heart is beating right strong, I'm super excited. I'm so stressed, but need to calm down and get into my character. I felt much as Copp?lia. It was so emotional. They both did very well. It was fantastic. - Thank you. - Beautiful. Oh, my God. I loved it. She could not see your number because ... But it is safe you were perfect. Did you enjoy it? Sorry. New York is stressful. All are wonderful. Everyone has potential. Everyone wants to go the same companies. These children are so hard themselves that if they make a small mistake, is difficult to deal with them after because they're perfectionists. Amber, look at me. Just tell me it was horrible. It was beautiful. Only that ... only the second bourr?e pas. It's a live performance. Whatever happens, happens, you know? You can not do this. You should enjoy this moment. See, you're hard on yourself. Vente. Let's go. Amber. Amber. Amber?? The finals are the best of the best. The greatest of the great, so for many who much is at stake. She is very talented and is beautiful. If you put it all together in this lovely package, has everything going for it. The difficult thing for a dancer right now is the fact that there very little employment. With this in mind, just follow your dream. It felt good. Some girls, how they work, really are pointed. Present your foot. They turn and are very accurate. Many of them have a facility, a body, feet and wonderful legs. You see them and say: '' She does have that something. She's going to win.'' Everyone is looking combinations body training, passion and personality. It is very rare. It is one in a million. It is assumed that I have to see me as Spanish. lmagino in Spain have curly hair, so, yes, I'm getting these. I'm half. Half? Yes. Well, I feel butterflies. Sometimes I have to go to pee, but okay. Right now no. Good Luck. Number January 1, Miko Fogarty, January 2 years United States of America. Don Quixote variation . Excuse me, sorry.

Issue 1 1 4, Michaela DePrince, USA, Fall fast . It hurt so much. Seriously, I thought it was not going be able to do any of this. I just had to remove all bounds.
