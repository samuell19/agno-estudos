[♪♪♪] Oh, boy. Good old hotcakes. Love them. Hey, why don't you eat your hotcakes before they get cold? I've got to work on my radio slogan contest. If I win, I get 10,000 bucks. You've been working on that thing for weeks. You'll never win. I got it. How's this for a slogan? "Burpo Pudding, what a treat. Even good for tired feet." Beautiful. Burpo Pudding, what a treat. Even good for tired feet. I just love ketchup on my hotcakes. Oh, that's delicious. But for me, I like the good old-fashioned syrup. It's a little bit sweeter. [LAUGHS] [SIGHS] [MOANING] [MUMBLING] What did you say? [MUMBLES] That's what I thought you said. Wait, now. What's the matter with him? His jaws are stuck. [GROANS] Heave up. [GROANING] Wait a minute. Wait a minute. [GROANS] Hold it. Maybe it's something he ate. Yeah. It's those hotcakes of yours. My hotcakes? You're crazy. [MOANS] Well, I admit the hotcakes ain't so good, but the syrup's delicious. [MOANS] You idiot. That's not syrup, that's glue. [GROANS] [GROANS] [GROANS] I got it. This will open it right up. There. Now, watch it. [GROANS] Oh. [MOANING] I got it. Hot water always melts glue. [GROANS] Wait a minute. I know what I'm doing. I... I just know. There. [GROANING] See, it worked. What are you trying to do, boil me? You think I'm a lobster? Oh. Wait a minute. Unguard your eye. [LAUGHS] I fooled him. Well, you certainly did. Pardon me. Yes? Get away from here. [GLASS SHATTERS] Hey, Shemp, bring me something to clean my mouth. Oh, this will clean anything. Open your mouth. This will fix it. [MOANS] I've got to write. I've got to finish this here thing here. [MOANS] Shempy. What-y? Like to play games? Oh, I love to play games. Close your eyes and open your mouth. [GROANS] There. [PHONE RINGS] Answer the phone. [MUMBLES] [GROANS] Hello. Hello. May I speak to Mr. Shemp Howard, please. My name is Shemp Howard. Mr. Howard, this is the Mystery Motor Jackpot Program. If you can guess the name of our mystery auto from the sound of its motor, you will win the $50,000 jackpot. Listen now to the mystery motor. Oh, that cheap gasoline. Oh. My bunion aches. Bunion ache. Bunion ache. Bynyan Eight. That is absolutely correct, Mr. Howard. You have just won the $50,000 jackpot. Fifty thousand dollars. I'll be right over. [MOANS] Hey, fellows, I just won the $50,000 jackpot. Oh, boy. I won a contest at last, which makes up for all of the past. Hot dog. Now we can live like gentlemen. Gentlemen. Boy, what a swell dump. You know, this reminds me of that penthouse we were thrown out of once. Look at this room, fancy and clean. I feel like a king, if I just had a queen. [LAUGHS] Oh. Quiet. Hello. Send up a dozen bottles of champagne. A dozen. Dozen! Spell it? Make it twelve instead. [MUMBLING] Gentlemen, the furnishings in this room are of great value. Now, for instance, this genuine Ming vase is valued at $5000. [ALL GASP] Ming. Oh, no wonder it cost so much for a Ming coat. Over here, please. Now, this beautiful bed goes back to Henry VIII. That's nothing. We had a bed that went back to Sears Roebuck the 12th. [ALL LAUGH] Always kidding. Gentlemen, if I can be of further service, please call me personally. ALTOGETHER: Thank you. Mr. Personally. [ALL GRUNT] You cement head. Why, that's an insult with me. In my country that's an insult. En garde. I got it. [MOANS, SCREAMS] Look, a rowboat. A rowboat? You're crazy. That's a horse trough. Horse trough, rowboat? In a hotel? You imbeciles, that's a bathtub. Go on, take a bath. Wait a minute. It ain't spring yet. Oh, yes, it is. See the grass? Where? You're crazy, that's a bath mat. Oh... Oh. Help. Turn on the lights. I can't see anything. It's dark in here. Fellows, help me. I'm going blind. I'll... I'll help you. I can't see. I can't see. BOTH: What's the matter? I had my eyes closed. Go on. Take a bath. Boy, what a beautiful bed. And just what we need a triple decker. I want the upper berth. You get less air up there. Uh, how can I get up there? Where's the ladder? What? [GRUNTS] How I love this pretty bed. Now I'll rest my weary head. Good night. [SHEMP SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] What happen? Get this Henry VIII off my neck. When I get out of here, I'll murder you for this. [GRUNTS] What are you trying to do, break my neck? Your neck? Look at my hat. It is broke. So it is. Oh, I can fix that. [GRUNTS] My hat. Why you... [GRUNTS] Pay for it. That's what I'll do with you. Come here. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] Look. [SCREAMING] See that? Quiet, you guys. Oh, boy. Champag-ny. [LAUGHS] Give the man a tip. Certainly. [CASH REGISTER DINGS] There you are, my man. [SQUEAKS] Yes, Darwin. That's a good baby, Darwin. Girls. Girls, I just found out that the three bachelors that won the $50,000 jackpot contest are right next door to us. Fifty thousand dollars? Baby, how we could use some of that. And we will get it too. Darwin, you go next door and you get lost. We will come and find you. [SQUEAKS] Go on, Darwin, go on. [RUMBLING] This bottle is flat. So is your head. Oh. I'll sharpen this one up. Believe me, I'll sharpen it up. I'll get this one to start off in a minute. [GASPS] I guess I sharpened this one a little too much. You've had enough. Give me that bottle. Let go. Give me that. Let go. Ungh! [HICCUPS] Boy, oh, boy. [SQUEAKS] [GASPS] I got them. I got them. I'm seeing things. Moe. Moe. Moe, I got them. I got them. I'm seeing gorillas. Well, don't look at me when you say that. [GRUNTS] You know, one of these days, I'm... Hey, look, those pants are moving. The joint's haunted. Maybe it's ants. Hey, fellows, what's going on? Your pants are walking, and you ain't in 'em. Mm-hm, you've been drinking again, eh? That's impossible. Whoever heard of pants walking when nobody's in them? I'll show... Ow. My pants bit me. [GROANING] We better kill that. Wait a minute! That's that $5000 gadget. [GASPS] Oh, I ought to annihilate you. You... Here, I'll get it. Wait a minute. Let a guy that knows how to do it kill that thing. [ALL GASP] Why didn't you give me a softer board? Get out of here. And you, why didn't you move that vase over further? Well, I'll tell you... Oh. Now, listen, you... Hey, fellows, you were right. It was a big animal, all covered with fur. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. That bath went to your head. [GROANS] Come on, get your pants... [KNOCK ON DOOR] ♪ Come in ♪ ♪ Come in ♪ ♪ Come in ♪ Gentlemen, this registered letter just arrived, and I thought it might be important. Thank you. Oh, it must be our prize money. My bed. Oh.

Now, look pretty. That's that darn detective. He won't go away. He won't, eh? Well, we'll fix him. Man the champagne buckets. Give. [ALL SCREAM] [ALL GASP] We're terribly sorry. We thought it was somebody else. Oh, that's all right. It was... How about coming in and having some champagne, girls? Thank you. We will come back as soon as we put on some dry clothes.
