Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh! The nights dream away the time. Fie! That we are awake? The raging rocks! The shivering shocks! I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream. Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream. Methought I was... there is no man can tell what. Methought I was. But man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I was. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream. And it shall be called... Come now, what revels are in hand? The Battle of the Centaurs. The Battle of the Centaurs. We'll none of that. The Riot of the Tipsy Bacchanals. The Riot of the Tipsy Bacchanals. That is not sorting with ceremony. The Thrice Three Muses... The Thrice Three Muses mourning for the death of learning. It's an old device. Oh! Come, my Hippolyta. I must employ you in some business against our nuptial and confer with you... Hippolyta, my love... - Speak. - Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke. Thanks, good Egeus. What's the news with thee? Full of vexation am I, with complaint against my child, my daughter Hermia. Hermia... My lord? Stir up the Athenian youth. What say you, Egeus? Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord, this man hath my consent to marry my daughter. Put money in thy purse! Put money in thy purse! Three thousand ducats! Well. Uh-huh? For three months. Well? For the witch, as I told you. A stoup of wine, Maria?! He's the best actor in the world either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral comical, historical pastoral, tragical comical historical pastoral! Kill all the lawyers! Stand forth, Lysander. And this, my gracious duke, this man hath bewitched the bosom of my child. Can you give me the lean and hungry look? Yeah, smile. Smile! All right, who's my rogue? Who's my peasant? Who's my slave? You are. Don't saw the air so much with your hands! And be a void. Thou foul Lysander, with cunning hast thou filched my daughter's heart and turned her obedience, which is due to me, to stubborn harshness. Be it so she will not here before your grace consent to marry with Demetrius, I beg the ancient privilege of Athens. As she is mine, I may dispose of her, which shall be either to this gentleman. What say you, Hermia? Demetrius is a worthy gentleman. I do entreat your grace to pardon me. For I know not by what power I am made bold. But I beseech your grace that I may know the worst that may befall me in this case if I refuse to wed Demetrius. Fair Hermia... question your desires. Know of your youth. Examine well your blood. Relent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yield thy crazed title to my certain right. You have her father's love, Demetrius. Let me have Hermia's. Do you marry him. Scornful Lysander! True, he hath my love, And what is mine my love shall render him. And she is mine, and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius. Hence! I am, my lord, as well derived as he, as well possessed, my love is more than his. And which is more than all these boasts can be, I am beloved of beauteous Hermia. Look, Demetrius... I'll avouch it to his head... made love to Helena Maypole. And she, sweet lady, dotes... devoutly dotes... dotes in idolatry upon this spotted and inconstant man. I must confess that I have heard so much, and with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof. Demetrius, come, I have some private schooling for you. - You don't care... - I do care about you! And I don't want to hear about it! I know him better. I know better for you. ♪ I dreamt an angel crying ♪ ♪ I heard God sigh ♪ When will you listen... O, hell. "My... good... Lysander. By his best arrow with the golden head, the simplicity of Venus' doves, by all the vows that men have ever..." Sweet friend. God speed, fair Helena! Call you me fair? That fair again unsay. Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair! His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine. None, but your beauty, would that fault were mine. Take comfort, he no more shall see my face. Lysander and myself shall fly this place. Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal. And thence from Athens turn away our eyes to seek new friends, stranger companies. Your eyes are lode-stars, your tongue's sweet air more tunable than lark to shepherd's ear. Sickness is catching. O, were favor so, yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go. Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated, the rest I'd give to be to you translated... Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us? And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius. Adieu! How happy some o'er other some can be. Through Athens... I am thought as fair as she. But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so. He will not know what all but he do know. Things base and vile... folding no quantity, Love can transpose to form and dignity. Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind. And therefore, is winged Cupid painted blind. Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste. Wings and no eyes... figure unheedy haste. And therefore Love is said to be a child because in choice, he is so oft beguiled. As waggish boys in game themselves forswear, so the boy Love is perjured everywhere. For ere Demetrius looked on Hermia's eyne, he hailed down oaths that he was only mine. And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt, so he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt. AFI, the Athens Film Institute. All the world's a stage. And all the men and women merely players. At the Athens Film Institute, our end is to hold the mirror up to nature. So come, strut and fret an hour upon our stage. The Athens Film Institute. Oh, this learning. What a thing it is. How now? Well met, sir! My lady. "2-B." Uh, 2-B? Not 2-B. Ah. That's next door. Oh. Masters! Is all our company here? You were best to call them generally, one by one, according to the script, okay? - Hi. - Here is a scroll of everyone's names. First, good Peter Quince, say what the script treats on, then read the names of the actors. Marry. Our show is... the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby. - Ah. - Now, good Peter Quince... call forth your actors Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom. Ready. Name what part I am for and proceed. You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus. What is Pyramus? A lover, or a tyrant? A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love. I will ask for some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it... let the audience look to their eyes. I will move storms. I will condole in some measure. Okay, Francis Flute... Yet my chief humor is for a tyrant. The raging rocks... and shivering shocks shall break the locks of prison gates! And Phibbus' car shall shine from far and make and mar the foolish Fates. Yay! That's great. Francis Flute? Here, Peter Quince. Flute, you must take Thisby on you. Oh, what is Thisby? A wandering knight? The lady that Pyramus must love. Let me play Thisby, too! I will speak in a monstrous little voice. Uh, Thisne... Thisne? Ah, Pyramus, dear! Thy Thisby dear and lady dear! Huh? No, no, you must play Pyramus. - And, Flute, you Thisby. - Well, proceed. - Snug? You must... - Snout. Uh... you must play Pyramus' father. - And Snout... - Snug. Snug, you, the lion's part. Have you the lion's part written? Are you, if it be, give it me? For he is slow of study. Let me play the lion, too. I will roar, that I will do any man's heart good to hear me. I will roar that I will make them say, "Let him roar again! Let him roar again!" You can play no part but Pyramus! Shall break the locks of prison gates! Pyramus is a sweet man... a proper man as one shall see in a summer's day, a most... gentleman-like man. Therefore you must needs play Pyramus. Well... I will undertake it then. Okay, wrap it up. Masters, here are your parts. And I am to request you to con them by tonight and go with me to the woods a mile without the town. By moonlight, there will we rehearse... We may rehearse most obscenely. And courageously. Take pains. Be perfect. Adieu. Ow. Adieu. H-Pup? I'll tell Demetrius of fair Hermia's flight. Then after her will he this night pursue her. And for this intelligence if I have thanks... it is a dear expense. Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour draws on apace. But O, methinks how slow this old moon wanes. She lingers my desire. The days... quickly steep themselves in night. The nights... dream away the time. And then the moon... like to a silver bow... new bent in heaven, shall behold the night of our solemnities. Hippolyta... I wooed thee with my sword, but I will wed thee in a different key, with pomp, with triumph, and with revelry. The course of true love never did run smooth. Either it was different in blood... Or else it stood upon the choice of friends... Or, if there were a sympathy in choice, war, death, sickness did lay siege to it... Making it momentary as a sound, swift as a shadow, short as any dream. Brief as the lightning in the collied night. That, in a spleen, unfolds between heaven and Earth. And ere a man hath power to say, "Behold." The jaws of darkness do devour it up. So quick bright things come to confusion. Whoo! How now, spirit? Either I mistake your shape and making quite, or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite called Robin Goodfellow. - Are not you he? - Thou speaks to right. I am that merry wanderer of the night. You have witchcraft in your lips. You have witchcraft in your lips. You have witchcraft in your lips. Therefore farewell, thou lob of spirits. Spirit, whither wander you? Over hill, over dale, thorough brush, thorough briar. Over park, over pale, thorough flood, thorough fire. Spirit? Spirit? I do wander everywhere swifter than the moon's sphere. And I serve the fairy queen to dew her orbs upon the green. Spirit! Spirit! The king doth keep his revels here tonight. Take heed the queen come not within his sight for Oberon is passing fell and wrath. But room fairy, here comes Oberon. Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania. What, jealous Oberon? Fairies, skip hence. I have forsworn his bed and company. Tarry. Tarry... rash... Wanton. Am not I thy lord? Then I must be thy lady. Why art thou here? But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon, your buskined mistress and your warrior love to Theseus must be wedded. How can'st thou thus for shame Titania glance at my credit with Hippolyta knowing I know thy love to Theseus? These are the forgeries of jealousy. And never since the middle summer spring, met we on hill, in dale, in forest, or mead. But with thy brawls, thou hast disturbed our sport. Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain, as in revenge, have sucked up from the sea contagious fogs, which falling in the land have every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents. The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain, the plowman lost his sweat, and the green corn rotted ere his youth attained a beard. Therefore the moon, the governess of floods, pale in her anger, washes all the air that rheumatic diseases do abound and thorough this distemperature we see the seasons alter. The spring, the summer, the childing autumn, angry winter change their wonted liveries, and the mazed world, by their increase, knows not which is which. And this same progeny of evils comes from our debate, from our dissension. We are their parents and original. Do you amend it then? It lies in you. Why should Titania cross her Oberon? Fairies, be gone, and be always away. I shall chide downright if we longer stay. Well, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove... till I torment thee for this injury. My gentle Puck, thou rememb'rest since once I sat upon a promontory and heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath that the rude sea grew civil at her song and certain stars shot madly from there spheres to hear the sea maid's music? I remember. That very time, I saw... but thou couldst not... Cupid all armed. A certain aim he took... and loosed his love shaft smartly from his bow as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts. Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell. It fell upon a little western flower, before milk white, now crimson with love's wound. Fetch me this flower. The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid will make or man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature it sees. Fetch me this herb and be back again ere the leviathan can swim a league. So quick bright things come to confusion. Alone in night and silence. Alone? Alone shines with a good grace. Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company... the clamorous owl that hoots and wonders at our quaint spirits? How then can it be said that you are alone when all the world is here to look on you? Uh... Hermia? I love thee not, therefore pursue me not! You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant. But yet you draw not iron for my heart is true as steel... D... Demet... Demetrius? I am your spaniel, Demetrius. Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me, neglect me, lose me! Only give me leave, unworthy as I am, to follow you... Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more! Fie! Demetrius! Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex. We cannot fight for love, as men may do! We should be wooed, and we're not made to woo! I'll follow thee! And make a heaven of hell! To die upon the hand I love so well! Demetrius! Demetrius! Fair love? You faint from wandering in the wood. And to speak troth... we have lost our way. Let's rest us Hermia, if you think it good, and tarry for the comfort of the day. Be it so, Lysander. Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit, for I am sick when I do look on thee. And I am sick when I look not on you. You do impeach your modesty too much to leave the city and commit yourself into the hands of one that loves you not. Your virtue is my privilege. I will not stay thy questions. Let me go, or if thou follow me, do not believe but I shall do thee mischief in the wood. Aye. In the temple... in the town, the field, you do me mischief! Don't fight, Demetrius! Fare thee well, nymph, ere he do leave this grove, thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love. Nay, good Lysander, for my sake, my dear, lie further off. Do not lie so near. Take the sense sweet of my innocence. Stay! Though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius. I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus! Demetrius... Do I entice you?! Do I speak you fair?! I mean that my heart unto yours is knit, so that but one heart you can make of it. Then by your side no bedroom me deny, for lying so, Hermia, I do not lie. Or rather do I not in plainest truth tell you I do not nor I cannot love you?! And even for that do I love you the more. Lysander... riddles... very prettily. O, wilt thou darkling leave me? Do not so. Amen, amen to that fair prayer say I! Stay, on thy peril. I alone will go. I am out of breath in this fond chase. The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace. Fare ye well. 'Tis partly my own fault, which death or absence... soon shall remedy. To Athens will I bear my folly back. And follow you no further. Back to Athens. Siri not available. Good night, sweet friend. Oh... Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end? Welcome wanderer, hast thou the flower there? Aye, there it is. I pray thee, give it me.

Yet Hermia still loves you, then be content. Content with Hermia? No, I do repent the tedious minutes I with her have spent. Not Hermia but Helena I love. Who will not change a raven for a dove? Is it not enough? Is it not enough, young man, that I did never, no, nor never can, deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye, but you must flout my insufficiency?! Fare you well.

So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear. A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here. - Kiss? - No kiss. But hark, a voice! Stay thou but here awhile, and by and by, I will to thee appear. Eh? Okay. Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue, I'll meet thee Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb. Ninus' tomb, and why are you... you must... no, you not speak that now. - That you answer to Pyramus. - Oh. Go again. I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb! - Ninus! - Sorry. Sorry. Wait, am I supposed to go that way... sorry.

Your cue is past! It is, "never tire!" Jeez. Again. As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire. I think that's him. If I were fair Thisby, I were only thine. O, Bottom, thou are changed! What do I see in thee?! What do you see? You see an ass head of your own, do you? O, sirs! Thy... Bottom? Thou art translated! Why do they run away? Help me, Lysander. Help me. Do thy best to pluck this crawling serpent from my breast! Ay me, for pity! What a dream was here. Lysander, look how I do quake with fear. Lysander? Lysander? Lord! Alack, where are you? Speak! No. Then I well perceive you are not nigh. Either you or death I will find immediately! Oh! I see their knavery. They wish to make an ass of me, to fright me if they could!

I pray thee, gentle mortal sing again for mine ear is much enamored of thy note. So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape, and thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me on the first view to say... to swear... I love thee. Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that. And yet, to say truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays. Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful. Nay! But if I had wit enough to get out of this den, I'd have enough to serve mine own. Peace. Out of this den do not desire to go. Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no. I am a spirit of no common rate, and I shall purge thy mortal grossness so, that thou shalt like an airy spirit. Go. Huzzah. Huzzah! Sweet... sweet... Oh, sweet mulberries! Oh... oh! I wonder if Titania be awake. Ah, here comes my messenger. How now, mad spirit? My mistress with a monster is in love. This falls out better than I could devise. But hast thou yet latched the Athenian's eyes with the love juice as I bid thee do? I took him sleeping. That is finished, too. O, why rebuke you him that loves you so? Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe? Stand close. This is the same Athenian. Uh... This is the woman, but not this the man. What's this to my Lysander? Where is he? Good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me? I had rather give his carcass to my hounds. Out, dog. Out, cur! Thou drivest me past the bounds of maiden's patience! You spend your passion on a misprised mood! I am not guilty of Lysander's blood, nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell. I pray thee, tell me then that he is well. And if I could, what should I get therefore? A privilege never to see me more. There is no following her in this fierce vein. Here therefore for a while... I will remain. What hast thou done? Thou has mistaken quite and laid the love juice on some true love's sight! About the wood go swifter than the wind! Helena of Athens look thou find. By some illusion see thou bring her here! I'll charm his eyes against she do appear. Flower of this crimson dye... hit by Cupid's archery... sink in apple of his eye. Hail mortal. Captain of our fairy band, Helena is here at hand, and the youth, mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee. Shall we their fond pageant see? Lord, what fools these mortals be! - Fie! - What a dream was here? Nooo! Weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh! I had no judgment when to her I swore. Nor none in my mind. Now you give her o'er. D-Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you! Ow! O, Helen... goddess... nymph... perfect... divine. O, spite. O, hell! I see you both are bent to set against me for your merriment. Can you not hate me, as I know you do, but you must join in souls to mock me, too? You are unkind, Demetrius. Be not so. For you love Hermia. This you know I know. Lysander, keep thy Hermia. I will none. If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone. Helen, it is not so. Disparage not the faith thou dost not know. Lysander! Look, where thy love comes. Yonder is thy dear. Mine ear, I thank it. Brought me to thy sound. But why unkindly didst thou leave me so? Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go? What love could press Lysander from my side? Lysander's love that would not let him bide. Why seek'st thou me? You speak not as you think. It cannot be. Lo... she is one of this confederacy! Now I perceive you have conjoined all three to fashion this false sport in spite of me. I am amazed at your passionate words. I scorn you not. Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn, to follow me and praise my eyes and face? And made your other love, Demetrius, who even but now did spurn me with his foot, to call me... - goddess, - Yeah. Nymph? Divine and rare? Precious? Celestial? Helen, I love thee. By my life, I do. Helen, I say I love thee more than he can do. If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it, too. O, excellent! Lysander? Whereto tends all this? Hang off, thou cat, thou burr. Vile thing, let loose. Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent! Why are you grown so rude? Out, tawny Tartar, out! Out, loathed medicine, O, hated potion, hence! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. O, the gods forbid. In earnest then, shall I say? Ay, by my life! And never did desire to see thee more. Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt, be certain, nothing truer, 'tis no jest that I do hate thee... hate thee... I do hate thee and love Helena. O, me. You... juggler! You canker-blossom! You thief of love! What, have you come by night and stolen my love's heart from him? Fie... fie. You counterfeit. You puppet. Puppet. Puppet! What, because, uh, I am so dwarfish? And so low?! How low am I, thou painted maypole? Speak! How low am I? I am not yet so low but that my nails cannot reach unto thine eyes! I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen, let her not hurt me. Be not afraid, she shall not harm thee, Helena! No, she shall not! O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd! And though she be but little, she is fierce. "Little"? Again? Nothing but "low" and "little"? Get you gone, you dwarf! You minimus! You bead! You acorn! Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right, of thine or mine, is most in Helena. Follow? Nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jowl! This is thy negligence. Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook. Did not you tell me I should know the man by the Athenian garments he had on? - Do you amend it then? - Eh... Gentle Puck, crush this herb into Lysander's eye, whose liquor hath this virtuous property to take from thence all error with his might and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight. Hmm, my fairy lord, this must be done with haste. For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast. See'st thou? These lovers seek a place to fight. Hie, therefore, Robin, overcast the night. Starry welkin cover thou anon with drooping fog as dark as Acheron. And to Demetrius sometime frame thy tongue. Whereart thou, proud Demetrius?! Here villain, drawn and ready! Then stir Lysander up with bitter wrong and sometimes rail thou like Lysander. Lysander! Thou runaway! Thou coward! Art thou fled?! Come recreant, come thou child, I'll whip thee with a rod! And from each other, look thou lead them thus. The villain is much lighter heeled than I. I followed fast, but faster he did fly. That fallen am I in dark uneven way. And here will rest me. Come, thou gentle day! Till o'er their brows death counterfeiting sleep with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep. Faintness constraineth me to measure out my length on this cold bed. By day's approach, look to be visited. When next they wake, all this derision shall seem a dream and fruitless vision. O, weary night... O, long and tedious night, abate thy hours. And sleep... that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye... steal me away. From mine own company. And back to Athens shall the lovers wend, with league whose dates till death shall never end. Never so weary. Never so in woe. I can no further crawl... no... further... go. And all things shall be peace. My lord?! My lord! The law. The law upon his head. This blood. On the ground sleep sound. I'll apply to your eye gentle lover remedy. Sweet friends. Demetrius? Ahh... When thou wakest, thou takest true delight in the sight of thy former lady's eye. And the country proverb known, that every man should take his own, in your waking shall be shown. Jack shall have Jill. Naught shall go ill. Man shall have his mare again, and all... shall... be... well. O, sweet, bully Bottom. Come, lie thee down upon this billowy bed, while I thy amiable head do coy, and kiss thy fair large cheeks, my gentle joy. I pray you, let none of your people stir me, for I have an exposition of sleep come upon me. Sleep thou. And I will wind thee in my arms. So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle gently entwist, the female ivy so enrings the barky fingers of the elm. O, how I love thee, how I dote on thee! Her dotage now I do begin to pity. Gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp from off the head of this Athenian swain that he, awaking when the others do, may back to Athens again repair, and think no more of this night's accidents... but as the fierce vexation of a dream. But first... I will release the fairy queen. Be as thou wast wont to be. See as thou wast wont to see. Dian's bud o'er cupid's flower hath such force and blessed power. Now, my Titania... wake you, my sweet queen. O, my Oberon. What visions have I seen. Methought I was enamored of an ass. Silence awhile. And in silence sad, trip we after night's shade. We the globe can compass soon, swifter than the wandering moon. When thou wakest, with thine own fool's eyes, peep! Morning love. Lord, what fools these mortals be. Ah! How now, spirit? Call the forester. Yeah, I was with Hercules and Cadmus once, when in a wood of Crete, they bayed the bear with hounds of Sparta. Uh, my hounds are bred of the Spartan kind. So flewed, so sanded, and their heads are hung with ears that... But soft. What nymphs are these? Good morrow, friends! Saint Valentine's is past! Begin these wood birds but to couple now? Pardon, my lord. I pray you all, stand up. I know you two are rival enemies. How comes this gentle concord of the world? My lord, I shall reply amazedly, half sleep, half waking, but as yet, I cannot truly say how I came here. The law, the law upon his head, my lord. Fair lovers, you are fortunately met. Of this discourse, we more will hear anon. Tis strange, my lord, that these lovers speak of. More strange than true. I never may believe these antique fables nor these fairy toys. Lovers and madmen have such seething brains, such shaping fantasies, that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends. Are you sure that we are awake? It seems to me that yet we sleep, we dream. The lunatic, the lover, and the poet are of imagination all compact. One sees more devils than vast hell can hold. That is the madman. The lover, all is frantic, see's Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt. The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling, doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven, and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown. Fair Helena, I wot not by what power, but... by some power, it is my love to Hermia... melted as the snow. To you, fair Helena, was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia. And... all the faith, the virtue of my heart, the object and the pleasure of mine eye... is only Helena. And I have found Demetrius, like a jewel... mine own and not mine own. Enough! Enough, my lord! You have enough! They would have stolen away, they would to be... Om... Fairy King, attend and mark, I do hear the morning lark! Whoo! Come my queen, take hands with me. Now thou and I are new in amity, and will tonight midnight solemnly sing in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly. There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be wedded, with Theseus all in jollity. Sound music! Music, ho! Egeus? I'm going to overbear your will. For in the temple, by and by, with us, these couples shall be eternally knit. Away with us, to Athens!

How will we beguile the lazy time if not with some delight? My lord. A Tedious Brief Scene of Young Pyramus and His Love Thisby. Very Tragical Mirth. Bring 'em in. They're here. And take your places. So, please, your grace? Approach! Yeah, come. Uh, if we offend... it is with our good will... that y-you should think we come not to offend but with... good will. - To show our simple skill... - Okay. That is the true beginning of our end. So. Um... Thank you. O, grim-looked night. O, night with hue so black. O, night. Alack, alack, alack! O, wall, show me thy chink! This is the silliest stuff I ever have heard. The best in this kind are but shadows, and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them. Wall! Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me! O, wall... full often hast thou heard my moans, for parting my fair Pyramus and me. I see a voice! Thisby? My love! Thou art my love, I think! Think what thou wilt. I am thy lover's grace. - Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb... - Ninus! 'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay! This is old Ninny's tomb. Where's my love? Well run, Thisby! Well roared, Lion! O, sweet moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams. I thank thee now for shining so bright. But stay! O, spite! But mark... poor knight. Eyes, do you see?! How can it be?! O, dainty duck! Thy mantle good! What, stained with... with blood! Approach, ye furies fell! O fates, come, come! Cut thread and thrum! Quail, crush, conclude, and quell! Oh! Out, oh, come, tears! Come tears! Confound! Confound! Out, sword. And wound the pap of Pyramus. Ay, the left pap, where heart doth hop! Agh! Thus I die! With the help of a surgeon, he may yet recover, and prove an ass. Thus! Thus! Th... Asleep, my love? Here comes Thisby, and her passion ends the show. What... dead, my dove? O, Pyramus, arise! Speak, speak! Quite dumb. Dead... dead! A tomb will cover thy sweet eyes. These lips, this cherry nose... these yellow cowslip cheeks, are gone. Are gone. Lovers, make moans. His eyes were green as leeks. Tongue, not a word. Come, trusty sword. Get her name. Come, blade, my breast imbrue. And farewell friends. Thus Thisby ends. Adieu... Adieu... Adieu. Bravo! A fine tragedy! And mirthful! Full of mirth! Well played, young man! Will it please you to see an epilogue? No! No epilogue, I pray you, for your... - your show needs no excuse. - Mm! - But come! Come! - Excuse.
