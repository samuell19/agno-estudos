(somber music) - I don't want to die in prison, man. I don't like being here for something that I didn't do. I didn't fall out of heaven, I know. I had my issues and I still do. I rub people the wrong way sometimes. But, you know, it's just, when you, it's like giving birth to something. You know, you have a birth defect on you, you gotta get yourself clean. You know, I used to be bitter and angry and frustrated and, you know, and when you're bitter, angry, and frustrated, don't nobody want to be bothering with you. Trust me, man. I used to be so angry and bitter and revengeful towards the Sikeston Police Department that it caused me health problems that I hid from my family. You know, I had crazy thoughts go through my head, far as like, hey, I'm in here for life without, I might as well do something, make myself, least I can say I did it. But, you know, that's the trick of the devil. (gentle music) (insects buzzing) (traffic rumbling) - I just don't believe God saved David to stay on up in there, 'cause if He thought he wasn't gonna come out and enjoy his life, he would have let him die in there. But he don't see fit for David to die in the prison, so he's not gonna spend the rest of his life in there. I'm speaking it. You know the bible says, speak things as though it was. Things are hope for and evidence not seen. That's what I'm speaking. I'm speaking it, 'cause the Lord say so and I'm a firm believer in the Lord. (ominous music) - I come back at, probably about 2:15, 'cause the club closes at 1:30 and I seen guys over on Luther and Osage, what we call the Sunset Area, one girl, Felicia Howard, said, man, Dave, they lookin' for you. They say you shot and killed that lady. (scoffs) I said, what lady, who I shot? And other people are coming, like, man, they looking for you! I said, Looking for me? So I said, Oh yeah? So now I don't hide here. I drive down to my mother house, check on my mother and let her know that I'm all right. But I go home to where I was staying at and I come back out and I see Drew Juden. I don't know it's him at the time, but I see a white Mercury Marquis, and I'm like, man! I come back, he out there and I say, hey what's up Drew? I ain't never had a driver's license. I drove more than three or four people. So I said, yeah, what's up Drew? He said, you know, I called in, you ain't got no driver's license. I said, all right. Is that what you wanted? He said, yeah. I said, so when I went out there, he don't know I already know this. It's not like this is New York City. You know, everything spreads fast. So I'm like, Drew, what you really want, man? So I seen him going for his gun, so I'm like, hm. So I kicked my girlfriend's car, who I knew had an alarm on it. When I kicked it, people's lights started coming on and I looked back and Dan Armon, I mean Drew Juden, got a gun to head, like, you move and I'll blow your black-assed brains out. I'm like, (chuckles), you better take a look around, Drew Juden, 'cause you're on video. I'm held for a 20 hour investigation. The investigation is over with, but they got a parole hold on me 'cause I'm on parole. They tell my p.o. officer that I was involved in a homicide. They didn't charge me so the p.o. was like, well, let him go. They said also we found some drugs. I never was charged with no drugs. There wasn't no drugs found, neither. August 5th, I got arrested August 30th, rearrested. - Before I was arrested? It was out that Mosby done it. They say, well why come you don't you say Mosby did it? I don't know Mosby did it. I don't know nothing about it. I told you, I'm innocent. I didn't have nothing to do with it, I didn't play no part. They thought I was being hard. I'm not being hard. I mean that I don't know! I didn't do it, that's all I can tell you. Didn't know nothing about it. I told them if I knew I would tell you, but I don't know. (somber music) - Albert Baker was kind of like your typical jailhouse snitch and when you looked at all the records, Albert was in jail in Scott County on a burglary charge, and his bond was like $5,000. Well, most generally, Albert didn't have five cents to play in his pocket with. So, he, originally, according to the records, again, told, I think it was Blakely, that he had no knowledge of the shooting or David Robinson's involvement, if any. But about a week later he comes up with this miraculous, well, okay, I remember now that yeah, I saw him over, come across the railroad tracks, go over to Helm's parking lot, at the pay phone, shoot the girl, and walk away, and that next day his $5,000 bond went away and he got released on his o.r. - Between the time I got out, I believe I got out like August the 9th, and I was rearrested for a homicide like August the 30th, I didn't think nothing of it because I know I didn't do nothing. I knew I had witnesses say where I was at and put me at the location that I was at. But while I was out I knew that Detective Blakely was telling everybody he was going to take me down for the murder of Sheila Box, and that he didn't care if he had to break the law doing it. So I stopped and I asked him. - They came to me and told me that Blakely said he was going to take me down. Actually, they presented their case like, I'm just a cold-hearted, blooded, cold-hearted murderer, and they alleged that Albert Baker said that he crossed the street, and he was five feet away from me during the time when I shot Sheila Box, who literally said that the bullet went and blew her heart out, you know? And like my lawyer and I said, if I was such a cold-blooded killer, why would I let Al Baker live to tell the story? I didn't know him from a can of paint. (somber music) - What's Sikeston like if you're not a football star? Hope you got family who doesn't live there and welcome you to come live with them. I don't think Sikeston is for anybody, that's, man, I'll tell like this. A good lawyer, who's a friend of the family, told me back in high school, he said, "Justin, I'm going to be honest with you." He said, "Sikeston is not the place for a young black man." It gets like that, but it can even be the fact to where they can pull you over and say, license and registration. Here you go, they tend to use this, why you out this late, or whatever. Sometimes you tell them. But a lot of people are like, if you won't tell them where you're going it's like that's a crime, just because I won't tell 'em where I'm going. A lot time people tell 'em, man I'm headed to my, man, I'm going to my cousin's house, I mean, why you pull me over? Well, you brake light was out and then they instantly switch back to, well, why are you going to your cousin's house at 1:30 in the morning? They assume and insinuate that everybody is committing a crime on the west end of town. That's, for me, born and raised and living in Sikeston all my life and seeing it and hearing about it and being in cars and even being a victim of it, you know, it's like they, they just want the power. They want the power. (solemn music) - Albert Baker was pulled out of his jail cell at 1:00 a.m. while he was fast asleep and interrogated and he wasn't on videotape, and so we don't know what he actually said. The story that Albert Baker told seemed to fit the facts. What Albert Baker said is, I was actually coming home from buying crack, and I was waking through this pathway in a field, and I see David Robinson just pretty much emerge out of the darkness, walk across a busy intersection, and shoot the victim while she was seated at a pay phone. He fired a warning shot on his way there, and then he reached into her car, shot her once, and sprinted away. What happened after that is that Albert ultimately received a series of payments from the state. It was represented by the state that these were witness protection payments. The amounts of the payments were somewhat suspicious looking. I mean, $10, $15, $20. At the time, Albert was also an admitted crack addict, and there's at least one other witness who said that Albert admitted that he used those payments to buy crack cocaine. - It's strange. I didn't know any of the local, especially the police department the size of Sikeston had a witness protection program, though that's what they called it. - I don't know. It seems to me, like, if the prosecution could do it, then the defense ought to be able to do it too. (laughs) Is that correct? No, but, yes, it was done, and, yes, it was obvious, and. - Albert Baker received these so-called witness protection payments. These were supposedly because one of the detectives on the case actually used Albert Baker's name in a public filing and, supposedly, that put him at risk. The problem is that the witness protection payments actually started before Albert Baker's name appeared in this public filing. He got released the same day as he gave his statement on what's known as a personal recognizance bond, which means you don't have to pay bail, just promise you'll come back for your trial. And, obviously, that's a pretty good deal. And then he received his first payment the next day. It was one of these small $15, $20 payments. And he actually received four total payments before he was ever formally placed into the witness protection program, as a result of that filing. So the question is, what does that say about the reliability and credibility of Albert Baker? - No and I've worked with darn near every police department, sheriff's department in the state of Missouri. - During that time I just felt like, well, I could just fight them from the backside, 'cause I could have had Johnnie Cochran or the dream team, I was going to prison that day in Scott County. - From the chief all the way down, to whoever else was involved in it, they knew from day one that he didn't commit that murder. People in Sikeston knew from day one that he didn't commit it because the one who supposedly done it was around telling people, you know? So I don't even think, to my understanding the day my brother got convicted, even her own mother said this is ridiculous and she apologized to my family. She said, because I definitely don't think that your son killed my daughter. We've placed it in God's hands, and we are going leave it there, because we know that our faith is not in man, because man will fail you every single time. So that's what we've been asking everybody to pray and we've been asking God to move because we know that man is not gonna do it. I mean David could have the best lawyers in the world, the best witnesses, you know, the most honest judges in the world, and all that stuff, but it's going to take a miracle and we waiting on that miracle. It's gonna happen, we're not giving up. And we've started to get a lot of support, not only from the west end of town, this end of the community, but from the whole town. There's people, you know, I've got a lot of friends, you know, I do a lot of volunteer work for the YMCA, I coach and I do a lot coaching for the Little League, so I've got a lot of friends here in Sikeston that knows my story, that knows my family's story, and you know, they're praying for us too. They're praying hard that justice is served. You know they live in this community too, and they don't want to live in a community that they think that the system is corrupt and a lot of them don't know. You have to open their eyes to situations and tell them, and get it out there, and let them know. So. (somber music) - You know, I'm an ex-police officer. I don't like to see people making things up to get somebody convicted, and that's what he did with Jason Richison, he threatened to throw him in the cell with the big dudes and he's a little tiny scrawny paranoid schizophrenic guy that thought that if goes into that cell he's a dead man. So he'd tell them anything they wanted to hear and he did, until he got up in Racine, or yeah, Racine, was, not Racine, but Appleton, Wisconsin. That's where I found him at and he finally gave a deposition. And he told the story to the Wisconsin public defender investigator and to an Outagamie county deputy that served him with the subpoena for a deposition. Told them that he lied and that he was threatened. Blakely was sitting in the back of the courtroom, and I looked at him and I said, yeah, that man does not deserve to be a police officer or detective or whatever. So was it on your agenda to get rid of him? And I said, well, after I get my client out of prison, yes. I'll do what I can and I will. (somber music) - Sometime in May, 2001, Officer Deputy Bobby Sullivan was informed by, he said his confidential informant, which he said named Dion Savage, which is also related to Romanze Mosby, called an told him that David Robinson didn't commit this murder, that Romanze Mosby did. - He was able to describe every single fact of the murder, and what he described is consistent with the objective facts of what happened that night. It explains why the victim was found with a handgun in her lap. It explains why other multiple witnesses saw her coming from a different direction than from where Albert Baker allegedly witnessed the crime, didn't witnesses the crime. Everything's explained by Romanze Mosby's confession. - Mosby had this terribly weight on his shoulders, and he just had to get it off and he actually told his cellmates that he had done that murder and he felt like dirt because David was doing the time for his crime. But that's exactly how he acted in that interview in Licking, was that he just needed to get this out of his system and off his shoulders. Why don't you tell me what happened on August 5, 2000, at close to the intersection on Ruth and Branum. - [Romanze] Well, I was in my uncles yard at 845 Ruth and a woman came through in a gray Suburban color, the color was, and she asked for some crack and stuff. I asked, I was like, I got it, and I started towards the truck. I didn't go all the way up on it. I didn't want her to see my face with it. And I seen the gun, the gun in her lap and stuff and her hand right there and stuff. I told her to throw the money, throw the money out and I'm gonna throw her the dope. And that's when I just shot her because I'd seen a little flash. I was walking up to it and she just raised her arm and that's when I shot her. - [Butch] Okay, so let me recap. You said you were standing out there on 845 Branum, or I'm sorry, 845 Ruth, and she pulled up in a sort of gray Suburban. - [Romanze] Yeah, gray suburban. - [Butch] And asked you, she was looking for crack. - Yeah. - Okay. So you started walking over there. She was gonna, what, throw the money out you just told her, throw the money out, - Yeah I told her. you didn't want her to see your face. - Yeah. - [Butch] Was that right? - [Romanze] Yeah, throw the money out. - [Butch] Throw the money out and you could go grab it. - [Romanze] Yeah. - [Butch] But you came up on the Suburban then and according to what you just said, you could see that she had what looked like a chrome 38, you know, laying in her hand. - [Romanze] Yeah. - [Butch] And then all of a sudden you saw it was silver, chrome flash as it was going on up. - [Romanze] Yeah I was gonna walk up to it and stuff. I was walking to it and I looked at it and she must have thought I was gonna rob her or something and that's when I shot her before could've shot me. - [Butch] So she was shot in defense. So you walked up, she whips the gun up and you responded to that. - [Romanze] Yeah. - [Butch] Her action caused your response. - [Romanze] Yeah. - [Butch] Did you see where she went after you fired your weapon? - [Romanze] I think she went, I don't know which way, she made a right on Ruth. - [Butch] Going toward Malone? - [Romanze] Yeah going toward the highway. - [Butch] Okay. - [Romanze] She got on the highway and I don't know what-- - [Butch] And you went where? - [Romanze] I went the other way. - [Butch] You went across, across, down, on down Ruth. - [Romanze] Yeah, down that way. - [Butch] To the west? - [Romanze] Yeah. - [Butch] And where'd you go that night, after this happened? - [Romanze] I just went walking. - [Butch] Walked around? - [Romanze] Yeah. - [Butch] Yeah, I asked you this before and I'll ask you again, what happened to the gun? - [Romanze] I gave the gun to my cousin, Dion Savage. - [Butch] You gave the gun to your cousin Dion Savage? - [Romanze] Yeah. - [Butch] And you don't have any idea what happened to it after that? - [Romanze] I don't know what, he said he was gonna take care of it. - [Butch] Okay. - After the shooting occurs, the victim immediately accelerates, and she starts heading west, northwest on Ruth Street. She takes a right onto Branum Avenue. She drives past Ronnie Robertson's detail shop, where he sees her swerving past. She keeps on driving and she actually almost hits Antonio Johnson and also Kevin King, who was going the opposite direction. Then she proceeds to crash through the fence into the Tradewinds, where then the police are called, and they go to the scene and she's nearly unconscious, and wasn't able, never able to identify who shot her, but they find this handgun in her lap that was otherwise unexplained. (somber music) - One evening I met up with Albert and he just was a whole different, I don't know, there was just something different about Albert. And he started talking and there was an insurance man visiting his lady friend, so we moved out on the porch and Albert broke down and said that he had made the story up in order to get out of prison or out of jail. And he was begging me to tell David how much he wanted his forgiveness, and to please forgive him and I said, you know, I'll convey it but I don't know, I can't tell you how David will receive it but I will certainly convey it, which I did. I made a couple of other trips. I went down and served him with a subpoena to testify at the PCR hearing. And when I served his with the subpoena there was the old Albert back again and it was something, I just knew he was going to turn around and go the other direction on me. And I tried my best to get him to stay on track with his confession, that he lied and made up the story. And you know, he played the game, that's okay Butch, it's not a problem and all this. I had forgotten to give him a mileage check so I had to make another trip down there, 'cause under the civil rule you have to do that with a subpoena, and he didn't want to take it. And I had to tell him several times that you know, I don't care what you do with it, just, I have to give it to you. And still he was very cold and indifferent. And I went back to my lawyer and I said we have a problem. He's gone south on us and he did. He absolutely nailed us to the wall in that PCR hearing. Nothing you can do about it. That happens. (somber jazz music) - For all those who labored with me, all those who believed in me, all those who trusted in me, all those who suffered with me, you know, that were persecuted, 'cause what effects me effects a lot of them. You got people who want to see me exonerated, you got people that don't. I mean, you know, I'm not worried about the naysayers or the haters or the backbiters or the trap setters, I mean I feel like I was put in this position to make a difference, a big difference because I'm not going to say some day, I'm going to say today, today forward. My goals and my plans deal with, is well within reach. I feel like God ain't let me go yet because if I had got out, if I had got Bryan Cave a lot sooner and say I got exonerated, I would have, I can honestly say that I probably, I wouldn't have been, I wasn't healed, man. (dramatic music) - That year, what had happened is, our firm had actually taken on David's case, and there was an article that had been run in the Southeast Missourian and shortly before that time some of our lawyers had succeeded in getting another person out of prison who had been wrongfully convicted and when the story was run, Romanze actually read it in the prison library. He was sitting with his stepfather, Kelvin Howard, and he read the article and Kelvin said he immediately got depressed once again. Romanze said, do you want to take a walk outside in the yard? And he goes outside with Kelvin, and Romanze proceeds to confess to his stepfather that he had actually killed Sheila Box. I accidentally shot her during a drug deal and he continued to say he felt horrible about it. But he also said he was afraid he was going to go back to prison. He was only about two months from getting out of prison at that time, and he was going to be released. So he asked Kelvin, you know, let's go take some pictures, and I think they get some photographs of them together taken, and then Romanze says something ominous. He says, take care of my mother for me and he goes back to his cell and later that night the guards actually wake up Kelvin Howard and they tell him that Romanze hanged himself in his prison cell that night. - That's something that I've thought about. Here I am married to a woman and her son committed a murder and tells me about it. And I'm kind of thrown up and tossed. But I want to do the right thing, set the right people free. That's what it's about. If David didn't do it, he didn't do it. - [Interviewer] Have you been surprised that after all of these years and appeals that David's still in prison - Yes. - even after they found out Romanze confessed? - Yes. - How do you feel about that? - Yes. - [Interviewer] What do you think about that? - I figured that his term should have been overturned by now. And they have enough evidence to prove that David did not do it. - [Interviewer] Yeah. - But they still own the man. - [Interviewer] Anything else you want to say? - I'd like the man to be set free. (dramatic music) - I just couldn't believe it, really, because the way the did my brother anybody could go, you know, they could do anybody like that. I mean, I could be driving down the road one day and they could say I'd done something that I know I didn't do. And I know the way they did my brother, then they could do me the same way and there's no way I could, you know, what could I do about it? And I struggle with it everyday. - [Officer] So today. - [Albert] August, around August 6th or 7th. - [Officer] But, I mean. (somber jazz music) - Along the way I've lost some people that's real, real close to me, man. I wanna do it for them. (David sobbing) I wanna hug my momma, man, as a free man. Just to be able to tell her we did it, we did it. - I go to prayer Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. I don't go on a Thursday. And that morning, or that time, they had denied him, I actually just felt like I was just going to die. Because it hurt me so, so bad. And one of my grandkids was here, and they called my sons and my daughter in laws and all my kids came here and I just was fading out. My sugar went up, I wouldn't eat. I sweating and shaking. They was trying to feed me. I wouldn't eat because I knew without a doubt that they were going to say, release him. And hearing all that they had in court, we just knew we was gonna have a party for my son coming home. But that hurt me so bad. It took back to where I thought God had failed me. I didn't even want to live no more and my prayer warrior, they called them and they came for prayer. They came down here and they gathered around me and they prayed and I came a little bit around. And when I proceed to think about that, God took me through a, I went through a dry spell with that. I thought that God had left me, didn't nobody care and God took me through walk. He said, see? I had faith in God, but apparently I didn't have enough the way he really wanted me to trust him. So he took me through a dry spell. He said, see? You all put all y'all trust in that judge. You wasn't looking at it right. You weren't talking about it right. Y'all were just saying, yeah, David coming home, David coming home, ooh, yeah. The judge is, you know, gonna say, release him. And we just knew in our hearts, and I knew in my heart that my son was coming home. And God told me, he said come on, I'm going to take you somewhere. He took me through a dark tunnel. He said this is faith. I want you to trust and believe and have faith in me. Put no other God or nobody else in front of me. You trust me. I said okay. He took me a little further. He said now this is how I want you to walk. I want you to walk in faith. Trust me. I got you. Then he took me a little further. He said this is everything. Everything going to be all right. And as I began to take that walk through that tunnel, that darkness, through that dryness, I went a little further and the light began to shine a little brighter. And when I came through, I said thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus 'cause he showed me to trust him. And I used to sit up and watch TV, and I used to say, mm, people that got kids railroaded into things, and single mothers that you know, don't have a father or husband nothing to help them through these things. And I'd say, mm. And I prayed and I prayed and I prayed, I prayed to God. I said, God, I said, how do these people, get the people to come to them and put it out there, let the world see what's going on with people, how people do you in these little towns, how they railroad your kids because you ain't got no money to fight for your kids to get a good lawyer. But God sent me some people that I didn't have to pay dime for to take David's case. Then so I said, Lord, I need somebody. I said, how do I go about this? And lo and behold, two years I prayed and they sent you all. They sent you all to do this and put it out there and let people know. And they sent the rest of the people. So I thank God. And I truly in my heart, I'm trusting in God that my son is going to come home this round. He gonna come home this round. - [Protestors] We want it now. - [Protestor] When do we want it? - [Protestors] We want it now. - [Protestor] When do we want it? - [Protestors] We want it now. - [Protestor] When do we want it? - [Protestors] We want it now. - When do we want it? - We want it now. - And we're gonna ask God to do for David what he did for Peter.

So, just from a fellow human being standard I guess I can understand why people would dig in their heels and say, no, no, I did the right thing, I did the right thing, I did the right thing. What strikes me as odd is when it come to the attorney general's office, who are not people who, I mean, I guess in this case there was an attorney general who was involved in the case, an assistant attorney general, but the particular people that defend these cases, on this level, they're not personally invested this. They weren't involved in that case. And I would hope, and I'm sure that they do an analysis, I'm sure that they look at these cases with fresh eyes, but it surprises me that in these cases with the kind of evidence we have that there's so much resistance, and that there's no willingness to say maybe this one is a worthy case. Maybe I've missed it, but I've never heard of a case in Missouri where any prosecutor or attorney general said maybe a mistake was made here. - I'd love to be the one to go pick him up and take him home. Bless his momma's heart, she needs her boy home. And it'll be a party. Oh, you bet, you bet. But he needs to go home, and I hope he gets there. Of course I've hoped for a lot of years, but you just don't give up on something that's right. You know? - I still want to see freedom for David before, before I leave here. And it would only be right. - If I was released and come up outta this, wow. (somber music) - When they picked him up, and let him back out, and picked him back up, I knew it was over then. But at the same time, even though I'm knowing that his life was gone, I still knew deep in my heart that my brother is innocent. So that's the only thing that kept me up, more to know that's he innocent. And that's the only we can go about living day by day to cope with it. I love my brother, and I know that he's coming home. Soon, real soon. - [Interviewer] All right? (somber music) - We know that we have a great case, got a lot of things going in his favor. But we also know that it's not promised that he'll be released. And when you think about, when you think about it, you know, it kind of makes it hard to trust and believe in the justice system. It kind of makes you iffy and sketchy about it, you know? Going through this with him the last 16 years, and being mostly at all of his court dates, and reading over all the paperwork and evidence and hearing every piece of evidence that they possible could have, it kind of would be devastating for the end result for him to not be released. - David Robinson shuffled into the Jefferson County Courthouse Wednesday morning and waved to his family. They filled half the gallery, many wearing Justice for David T-shirts. Robinson's shackles jingled as he stood to wipes his eyes. I'm getting emotional, he said quietly. - I've been there for when Albert recanted before, twice. First time before we filed suit on the video, and the second time at the deposition. I mean you could see David's reaction, I mean, he is not a man who comes to tears very easily, and he was extremely emotional. And he was almost inconsolable for a moment there. I thought we should have probably stopped. But, yeah, it was a very powerful moment, and when you've spent 17 years fighting for your innocence and the person who was responsible for doing it is up there and apologizes, it an incredible moment. - My brother has missed my grandmother's passing, which he was very, very close to. He's missed his grandfather's passing, which he was extremely close to and he's missed some other family members passing, you know, and that's real hard for a person to be sitting somewhere in a jail for a crime he didn't commit and you know, his family members are leaving this earth every day and he can't even say goodbye to them. He can't even hug them. He can't even express his thoughts at their funeral in person, you know, he has to send letters and stuff like that. But I got to tell you, you know, my brother does have breakdowns, but he's got to be the strongest man I know in my life. 'Cause for him to be locked up like that for 16 years for something he didn't commit, you can call him, he sometimes calls me and I'm having a bad day and he brightens up my day, and I'm living out here free. I can go where I want. I can do what I want. And sometimes he calls me, he can sense that I'm having a bad day and he's just like, and he tells you to just shake it off, you know? You got up this morning, you're blessed, you know? So he's probably the strongest person I've met in my entire life. To have been through so much and still when we talk to him, and when we go to see him, that you know, sometimes there is sad times, but for the most part he keeps a smile on his face. He says because he knows he didn't commit the murder and he's hoping and praying that one day the world will know that he didn't do it. - For everything that you have done, in the name of Jesus, we thank you for it right now. In his name, amen. - [All] Amen. - I really don't process that he might not get out. I just keep hoping that you know, one day he is going to get out. I mean, I'm not going to say he's not gonna get out, because then I wouldn't have my faith. - You know we're blessed that all of my siblings, I don't have any siblings that have died or you know, that have gone on, we all are still here just to be able to embrace. And my mother can have the wholeness of all of her children together, and have him use his story to help and empower others. To help use his story to help a community heal, (people chattering) to help my family heal, that he will go on and lead a productive life. (people chattering) - I have been pulled over before by this certain cop that we're talking about now. He wasn't in uniform, he was just, he wasn't even in a police car. He was in just like a state trooper car, one of those other kind of cars. And when he pulled me over he was like, do you know why you got pulled over? I was like, no sir. And was like, that I was speeding. And was like, I clearly wasn't speeding 'cause I had seen his sitting right there. And he was, like, he ran my name, he come back and he was like, well, I usually don't give warnings, no if you know who I am, I usually don't give warnings. And was like, well, I don't know who you are, who are you? And then he told me his name and he was like well, this time I'm gonna give you a warning. And I'm like, you know, that comment just didn't sit right with me. I'm like, either you're gonna give me a warning, was I speeding? Or what's the point of the comment? Since I've been seeing all this stuff on the news, I'm going to call somebody. My momma, my husband, somebody and say, hey, I just got pulled over, stay on the line, da, da, da, da,da so someone can hear everything that's going on. That's just what I do now. - Yes sir. - Immediately. - I get hooked up and I'm gonna stay on the line. Someone's going to know where I get pulled over and it's sad to say because I drive to work at 4:30 every morning. It's pitch black going down 61 every morning. And I'm not speeding or anything. I'm going the right speed limit, but I say to myself that if I get pulled over on this street, it's pitch dark, I'm going to drive all the way to work. I mean, I'm not going to get pulled over because I don't know what's going to happen. You're not safe anymore. So I'm gonna either drive to work, that I can, keep going, or I'm gonna wait until I get to a light or something, 'cause there's no light on that street. So I mean, I think that every morning. So, that's just, I don't know. You can't even trust them anymore. - Yes, it's sad and it is. (Ella chuckles) - I think this is just the way it's going to be. You know, I think, it's been rough, but I'm not going to complain. (chuckles) It wouldn't help anyway, would it? - [Interviewer] Yes it is. Yeah, I don't know what to say to that. (Ella chuckles) But. - You know, and the harder you try, the harder the police work on you. If you're trying to better yourself or your family, you know, they try to cut you down. Here, it's still going on. (somber music) (gentle music) - The attorney general, Josh Hawley was there, he was campaigning in David Robinson's hometown. He was campaigning and he's running for Senate. And I wanted to catch up with him. You know, he's coming down to Sikeston. David is in prison right now as the State is reviewing the case. And I wanted to know from him what was going on. So after he was done mingling with his supporters at a campaign stop he sat down at a table with me and you know, we had an interview with him. And I kind of felt like maybe he didn't know all the particulars of the case. When I asked him what the update was or what the status was, he asked me in return, well, what's your understanding of where this is. So I said, well, the supreme court ruled earlier this month, it's being reviewed, and you know, then he started, yeah, we review these cases, this and that, and I was asking him, you know, well, law enforcement officers testified under oath that there's no physical evidence against David. I said, and the two witnesses, the two state witnesses who put him there both recanted. I said, David's family wants to what else is there to review? He just didn't have a really good answer, he just kinda said we can't really talk about these things or whatever, you know, so he talked in more general terms, did a little story on it, but about 10 minutes later after leaving there, I was heading up the interstate and I got a call from a spokeswoman in his office. Saying, well, we just want to let you know that we're going to have an announcement Monday afternoon between one and two. She wouldn't say much more beyond that. She said it wasn't for print or anything. But I think everyone pretty much understood what that meant. There was no other way they could go. They could not retry David. There was nothing there. Unless they had some smoking gun that they haven't brought up in a zillion appeals. There's nothing there. They had no choice. You're gonna have to let him go. - We had already learned that the Attorney General's Office was going to be making a substantial announcement between one and 2:00 p.m. They didn't give any sort of indication about what the announcement was going to say, so there was a little bit of a flare for the dramatic on how they were going to present it. So between one and two p.m we really didn't even know where the announcement was going to even come from. We didn't expect that they were going to make any sort of press statement with microphones in front of them, because if they were going to do the right thing it's just not the type of thing where you want to be answering questions. So, basically, we were just hitting refresh like anyone else on the Attorney General's website. Ultimately what we learned and it came through a media source, is that the attorney general's office was recommending that all charges be dropped against David. (crowd cheering) - [Woman] From the custody of Jefferson City. (crowd cheering) - Oh god! Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. (women sobbing) Oh Jesus, oh Lord Jesus. Thank you, thank you father, thank you. (women sobbing) - The problem is it's only a recommendation. Just like Judge Missey's ruling was only a recommendation. You still need to go to the final decision maker. So at that point we started calling the prosecuting attorney in Scott County and asking him if would make a final decision as quickly as possible. We told him that we had David's family, we were standing outside the prison waiting for him to get released. We were there. There was a recommendation from the Attorney General's Office that obviously you don't want to go against that. And, so, essentially, we were asking him to do the right thing. - I know that they tried several times to get through to the Scott County's prosecutor, did not have any luck. When I called, told them who I was, they just hung up on me. Didn't even give me the courtesy of saying he was busy. Just click. So you know, then they ended up delivering that information via a news release to the TV station across the street, our competitors, you know, which is his prerogative to do. But that's how he delivered that message. Not to the attorneys. Not to David's family in any way. It was to KFVS. So the AG's office sent it to me, the Scott County prosecutor sent it to KFVS, and that's how everybody knew what was happening. It was the weirdest thing. I would not have expected everything to go down like that. (crowd cheering) - We never actually reach the prosecuting attorney himself. We reached someone at the receptionist area and she said he was busy. So we never actually go through to him. And once again we found out through the media and not from the prosecuting attorney. They just posted the letter and we found it on the internet. (somber music) That's when we had both the attorney general's recommendation and the final say from the Scott County prosecuting attorney and at that point we were calling the Attorney General's office because we had learned from the Department of Corrections that they were expecting some sort of sheet of paper, just with a handwritten wedding signature on it. No one actually understood what they were asking for, and there's a lot of confusion at that point. Probably about an hour later, just before close of business, everything appeared like it was going to fall apart. (somber music) - They've always been super friendly, smiles on their faces, cordial and stuff, but I'll tell you what when the Department of Corrections decided they had the authority to keep David locked up a little bit longer, Jonathan Potts face went from you know, happy nice guy to serious I mean business. I mean, the look on his face, he was furious. You know, I saw a different side to him that night. And of course Jim you know, he was there the whole night, working the phones, all of them. They were just working the phones. At one point Jim had a phone on each ear, you know, I was just really, really impressed. And they're doing this work pro bono. They're not making a dime off of it. - At that point, we just had to start getting on the phone making a lot of phone calls. First we called the Supreme Court of Missouri because we wanted to talk to the clerk's office to see if there was a procedure for us to file some sort of an emergency motion that night. To make sure someone that was going to be there to be able to receive it and hopefully distribute it to the judges on the Missouri Supreme Court. We were also calling the Missouri Attorney General's office to see if they would help us influence the decision of the Department of Corrections, since they're both State agencies, and say there's nothing that's actually preventing you from letting him out and, in fact, you're legally required to release David at this point, because there are no legal charges against him. And so we were reaching out to them hoping that we could potentially mediate an inter-agency issue that appeared to have arisen. They've screwed this up royally in terms of understanding that he needs to go home now. No matter what, he is coming home. So just make sure everybody keeps that in mind. Jim is on the phone with the Department of Corrections legal counsel right now and maybe you know, they do some sort of about-face, but I mean, I don't know what they're, I can't predict it. After a few hours, what we learned is that the Department of Corrections was interpreting the Missouri Supreme Court's order to say that David needed to be held the entire 30 days in prison after his convictions were set aside. And we just, that's just flat wrong. David was a member of the general public as far as we were concerned. Just like you or me, he was a member of the public. He had no conviction. He had no charges against him. But he was sitting in a prison. (somber music) - He didn't want Thelma to talk. (somber music) (people chattering) - He said right now he's on the yard, and that he's going to go back and tell them to let David call us and have as much phone time as he can. He told us we don't have to leave if we want to hang out all night long. As long as we were quiet, they didn't care. (men chattering) (somber music) (people chattering) (David chattering) - [Woman] I mean, we're spending the night. We're not going. We'll find somewhere. They were gonna stay at Martha's house. (David chattering) - Be here. - [Woman] He's going to have to be here as well. Yeah. (people chattering) (somber music) - [Woman] But it's our day, it's all of our days. - [Woman] Been all my life. (people chattering) - [Woman] Is it him? That's him! Yes. - [Woman] It's him. (people cheering) (woman sobbing) (David sobbing) - Oh my baby. Oh baby. Oh. (sobbing) Oh thank goodness. - [David] Oh man. - Oh, oh! - Oh my goodness. - It's true. Thank you Jesus. (Jeanette sobbing) - [Woman] Oh my goodness. - We did it, y'all, we did it. I want to thank each and every last one of you. With you and God, with God and all, I thank you, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for standing and trusting and believing in my son. You all didn't give up. You all didn't give up and I thank you, I thank you for it. (woman sobbing) Oh Lord, I asked the Lord and oh God, he answered my prayers. The dream has come true. - That's work of God. - Thank ya, thank you Jesus. - Oh thank you, Jesus. - Oh God, I thank you. I thank you, thank you, I just can't thank you. To God goes the glory. Yes, God. (sobs) Thank you baby. - I appreciate your patience. I want to thank everybody for hanging with us. It's been a hard 18 years, almost. - Yes it has. - And the pain was deep. But I was so numb I almost became a hateful man. This woman right here, I want to thank my attorneys. I want to thank Sheila Box's family for supporting me. - Yes, yes. - And all those who believed in me. I want to thank my attorneys, Stephen Snodgrass, Jim Wyrsch, Charlie Weiss, Jonathan, Butch, I don't see him, but Butch. Linda Bollinger. All the guys from the-- - Louie from the Wrysch Lawyer . - Who? Oh, I want to thank you but I forget your name (crowd laughing) - But I didn't forget, I don't forget. - Wrysch Law Firm. - [Woman] And Bob Miller. - And Bob Miller, I couldn't do it. - Just everybody. - Ben, Steve. What's her name? - Erin. - I can't think of names, y'all. - Erin. - Moriarty. - Don't tell Ben. - Moriarty. - What's her name, Bridget DiCosmo, who contacted me in 2009 and told me that she heard that I may be innocent. My mind was reeling from the injustice and I kinda like rejected it. But I prayed on it. And through the years I just kept on fighting and pushing and people believing in me. The people who I thought didn't make a difference in my life is the ones who turned around and made a difference. Lord, as Pastor Martin Luther King said, free at last, thank God almighty I'm free at last! I'm free. - [Crowd Member] Woo! - Yeah! (David sobs) - They didn't break my spirit momma. (gentle music) (interviewer chattering) - Well, there's a large irony in how we treat recanted testimony. Because what happens is someone comes forward and they say, you know what, I lied. I made it up the first time, I recant. And what we do is, the system says okay, that guy's a liar and we don't believe him. But we've decided that we're not going to believe him this time. We're going to believe him the first time. And it just doesn't make sense. There's something to be said that we want to discourage people from being able to lie under oath and come back and just be completely absolved of their sins, and to potentially reverse convictions by jailhouse snitches who are flip-flopping. But then you probably shouldn't be using that person in the first place. And that's really the problem. - Well, one of the interesting factors about this case is that the victim's family came out in support of David's innocence. After reading our coverage, after being presented with all the information, Sheila Box's daughter reached out to David's family and said she supported them. I called Crystal, Sheila's daughter, and she told me that, yeah, after seeing all this I believe David's innocent. - Yeah, she said she had been following it about a year and just came to the conclusion he's innocent, and she was upset that this is digging up all sorts of emotions in me, like I said, when you have a wrongful conviction you make the victims victims twice. You know, they got to relive this stuff, but she knew things about how the investigations went down, she wasn't happy with it, but she very much was in support of Robinson's family and later went on national TV and claimed as much. So that was a really interesting development, I think. You don't always have that, you know, when you have victims families who want the answer. They want to know they got the guy, they don't want to live with the guilt with the wrong guy being in there. So it wasn't the case here. Sheila's daughter and Sheila's ex-husband both supported David in his innocence. (birds tweeting) - My frame of mind is, man, I'm trying to regroup and move on. I've been spending a lot of time enjoying my time with family. Absorbing the things that have been taken from me. Just getting out and about, man. Sitting down on the riverfront in peace and quiet just trying to elevate my thoughts in a positive direction, just trying to stay positive, man. Yeah, my mother's a prayer warrior and she's got a host of angels that prayer warrior with her too. My momma was hurt and beat up. Stressed out. Destroyed. I don't give my mother enough credit, because I haven't been there in 18 years, almost. And it ain't nothing like being there in person and telling her you love her and miss her, and that you apologize for all the chaos you caused. But my mother never stopped believing that I wasn't going to come home. And that kept me going, because I know a lot of people that gave up. I wasn't giving up, even when I wanted to give up, my mother wouldn't let me give up. Anything worth having is worth fighting over. And like my guys, you know by being in prison we have our own language, and I say to them, man, don't give up. Don't, put away those childish things and think as a man, and do what you got to do, man. Because I was at that road that I didn't think, everything I filed was getting turned down, what we called knocked in the head. To get a denial is a blow of death. We try to stand up and be strong, and we try to put on a strong face, but deep down inside it be hurting. And sometimes that hurt and anger can turn you into something that you don't want to be. I don't want to be the one out here just talking loud and saying nothing. I want to make a difference. I'm gonna make a difference because a difference was made and a chance and opportunity was handed to me. I mean, just keep it at a hundred is all I can say. That's my final words.
