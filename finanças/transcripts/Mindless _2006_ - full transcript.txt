"I was always facing explusion from school because of my behaviour" (In a heavy Russian accent) You better dress up tomorrow! The news show is doing a story on us! And you, Jaansoo, wear your suite! - You mean suit? - Yes, wear your suit! "Learn, learn and learn!" - V. I. Lenin "I got my degree in chemistry, since it had the least competition" "Actually, I mostly just horsed around" "A girl from my class was getting married and the groom was a real practical joker" May I have your attention, please? Here's a little surprise "The groom really wanted me to kidnap the bride as a prank" "So I did" "And in the end, the bride chose me over him" "She became my wife" I'm just explaining why I want the Honourable Court to sentence me to life in prison MINDLESS "Silence, please" Please continue "Then I got a job, doing this and that, until I partnered up with a friend in the early 90s" "We started importing cellphones" "Mostly Nokia" "We started out with a desk and two chairs..." - (On the phone) "Toomas speaking" "...but then came the secretaries, cars, houses, loans..." "...leases, deals, real estate, Kenya, Thailand, New Year's parties in Cuba..." "...yachts, golf, clubs, platinum cards" "This went on for 10 years" "Until I snapped" Yes, Tom, yes! Take a look at this "Toomas Jaansoo - the sole retailer of Nokia in the Baltic States" I don't know who you had to blow for this, but it worked Hey, how about celebrating tonight? We could go to a night club or rent a sauna - You know Ester won't let you - What's Ester got to do with it? We'll only be gone for an hour. We have reason to celebrate "What do you mean you 'snapped'?" I think, at one point, most of us question the purpose of our lives For me it was during that elevator ride What happened in that elevator? I had always reassured myself that "it's that one last push"... ...and then I'll really start living my life This one last project and then... But what if this "and then" never comes? Congratulations! Today, I was in a fitting room and I looked so ugly Ugly from the front, ugly from the back. Tolerable from the side But it was still really horrible - Hey! - Oh, hi Miku! What's going on? I'm the sole retailer! Nokia, Nokia, Nokia! I'm the king of the Baltics Over here! Did I tell you what happened in a fitting room today? I looked so ugly! Ugly from the front, ugly from the back. Tolerable from the side But still ugly! I really wanted these trousers, they were just my colour Really well tailored Who the hell can fit into these? Even the sales girl thought I was too fat for these trousers - She actually said that? - No, but I could tell by her sneer They were even bigger than my usual size, but still didn't fit me So I bought the smallest size just to spite her I think I'll go on a diet Anu, I have a funny story for you - Is it dirty? - Not too dirty You know I haven't had a real vacation for almost 10 years? I know So I thought... I've been working really hard all this time So I thought I would take the whole year off That's a great idea And I'll go somewhere remote, by myself. For a year or so Don't worry about money, I have it all worked out And what are you going to do there, all by yourself? I don't know. But I think that... For the entire year? That's the plan, but it's not set in stone. It's not like I'm going to prison So what do you think? You'll have to tell Tanel yourself Tanel Toomas speaking You found one? Yes, but does it have a lake like we discussed? I'm on my way Mr Jaansoo? Hello, I have just the place for you - That's great Follow my car I see you've already got the car for these rough roads So what do you think? Remote countryside, 3-phase electricity, running water... ...driven well, geothermal heat pump. It's a genuine ecovillage What about the lake? We'll knock down these trees and make one Since your property will face the lake, it will cost extra. Excuse me. This is Eco Real Estate As promised - beautiful surroundings, 800m from the seaside Ilmaotsa (the edge of the world) Which way is the highway? - Take this road, turn right... - That road's been closed for ages - Go past the mill, near the irrigation ditch - Just take the same road back Are there any houses for sale in this area? Just the one the guy in the tractor is selling... ...but he's not right in the head - Shush! - Don't shush me! You shouldn't say stuff like that to a stranger Lovely weather today! The day is still young Do you live around here? You call this living? I'd like to buy a place here - Here? - Yeah Ever since my dad's death, the house has been empty My wife took off with our daughter long before And where is this house? Just past Asta's place - Asta who? - Asta, the late miller's wife I should have mentioned - I'm not from around here - So where are you from? - Tallinn Do you know Jaan, the blacksmith? He did some construction work there Actually, I think I do Do you have enough money? - I have a little - You won't get far on "a little" Let's get in the car We're going to talk business Nice set of wheels you've got. I used to drive a T40 tractor Then the government took it away and now I'm unemployed - Can't you get another job? - Not as a tractor driver - So what's your place called? - P??sj?rve (Lakeway) - So there's a lake? - Almost on my doorstep - Is it remote? - As remote as it gets How much are you willing to pay? 200 thousand, but I'll need to see it beforehand I don't want to rip you off. Let's say 50 thousand and a case of beer? - It's got a roof, right? - Evertyhing's shipshape! You've got the lake for fresh water. No electricity, inaccessible road Have the place for tonight and come find me in the morning Ask for J?ri, that's me. Then we'll work out the paperwork - Why wait that long? - So you don't want the house? - No, I still want it. Let's go - Wait Ilmaotsa Municipal Office Thank you, Tiiu So, P??sj?rve - Yes - He has no right to sell this land - How so? His pop used to live there, right? But it's always been municipal land - Now what? - Nothing. The deal's off Can't we work something out? No This house doesn't legally exist, there is no paperwork for it You'd have to outsmart the system - But it can be done? - It's really complicated - You're top dog around here - I wouldn't say that J?ri, have Tiiu make you a cup of coffee This is Tanel's father. Is he there? Yes, he's here Tanel, it's your father Tanel... I might be going away for a while OK Maybe even for the whole year I'll still send you money. Twice as much OK You can have my car You'll come visit me? - Sure - I can't drive any further - I see It's nice and warm here I'm Uugu. From the M?eselja farm I hope it rains - Why? - Just planted some potatoes Oh bugger, I forgot to do that - There's no electricity - That's right My sister lives in Tallinn with her 2 kids. Her husband left them - It happens - Yes, it does They live in a flat on Marksi street My son works in a laundromat in Tapa, doing a woman's work He bought himself a car - That's nice That's what I said My wife hanged herself - What happened? - It was just before Christmas We bought some cheap meat from Meinart We were slicing it up for headcheese and I said to keep the rind Later I found her hanged in the cellar There are plenty of mushrooms in the fall. And you can ask me for potatoes So what do you do? Are you some kind of businessman? I'm a man of faith This used to be old Julius' place - J?ri's father? - That's right Thanks Julius once called me a good man You know what, Uugu? You are a good man I should get going Wake up! 2 AM So where will we do this? Here or indoors? - Do what? - I'm not sure myself I brought you some ham - Thanks. How much is it? It's token of my gratitude. A down payment I'm not sure I understand Uugu said you really helped him, turned his life around. I'm Meinart - What else did he say? - That you uttered some wise words Said he'd bring you a sack of potatoes. So I brought the ham, if that's okay That's just fine Let's get started - Should I take off my shoes? - Yes, of course Go ahead and talk - I don't know what to say - What do you do? - Nothing really. Keep some cattle I have some savings, but not enough to move to the city - What's so great about the city? - Not sure. But there's lots of people - They don't care if you come or not - Don't I know it. They couldn't care less Actually, I don't want to move. I've stopped wanting anything My old lady has run out of things to order from the catalogue They come by mail, but they're never as pretty as the picture I don't want anything. I just work on my farm and try to get through the day I've forgotten how to want something. I feel like nobody needs me I sold some land and we had money for awhile So we'd order trinkets like clocks and coffee makers The best part's the waiting and worrying. And finally you get to unwrap the box But that's it. And then you order something else She really loves it The rest of the time we watch TV. And I drink now and again But sometimes she gets angry and hits me - Why? - She can't stand me She just watches her telenovelas. Won't even tend to the animals She only hits me when I'm drunk. Doesn't like it when I get chatty - How do you feel about her? - Can't stand her either, but... ...she used to be a real looker I can still picture her working on the collective farm Her skirt riding up, her hair sweaty I've never seen a more beautiful woman I could never hit her back - You still love her? - I do - And your animals? - I love them as well - And your piece of land? - That too I never thought of it that way - What else could you want? That's my problem. I don't want anything If you have love, you don't need to want anything else - So what should I do? - Nothing Just believe that you're happy - How do I do that? - Say it out loud - Right now? - Yes - "I'm happy". Like that? - Say it again - I am happy - More boldly - I am happy - More loudly I AM HAPPY! I AM HAPPY!! Don't tell anyone about this - You'll tell them yourself Are you crazy? Does this mean I'm happy? - Yes Meinart! Hold onto this acorn until you're home - Will do Can I drink sometimes? - Sometimes. If you hold the acorn I got it And if the missis hits me? - Then forgive her - Great! What are you looking at? I came to stay the night I didn't come here to sleep with you But if it turns out that way - no harm done I'm not a virgin And my erogenous zones are... ...here... ...here... ...and here as well And I may hurt you a bit - Hurt me? - Let's just see how it turns out I know what men like. It's... always the same What's that "man of faith" thing about? - Nothing really - There has to be something Are you shy about it? - No I speak words that are not my own - So you are shy I thought you're a pagan. With a pendulum and all that I guess I was wrong The people whose words you speak probably want you to speak them I think it's high time people started believeing in someone or something - Why? - Just cuz I believe in you. You have to pursue this Think about rituals. And your clothing And people like religions with names - What people? - The ones who're coming here Wednesday at 3 There's a spot nearby. You'll know which one Maybe no one will come. You've been alone all this time? Yes Want to get laid? I bet you're married. Is that a problem? - What's your name? - Silly Sally It's nice and bright here Don't you want to see me? I do Show me your stomach Touch me That's enough for today - Why? - Just cuz I have lots more to show - My head's throbbing - Which head? - You know which one - Good There'll be no funny business tonight - Why? - Just cuz I'm keeping my clothes on, as are you. And keep your hands to yourself I'll come back here - When? When I do, just pin me to the doorpost and kiss me You sleep on this side I like the light Our souls come from the light We were born from the light From a dazzling light We're still connected to that light Like a lightbulb connected to a battery that grows fainter by the day And finally it goes out The light of our souls also needs recharging We charge it by living lives full of good deeds and thoughts So we can return as bright as ever If a bee spends the day gathering nectar... ...but returns with a sack full of tar... ...he won't get into the hive He'll buzz around the hive, "let me in, let me in!" But he won't get in. He realizes his mistake, but it's a little too late And what becomes of him? - He's left alone and withers and dies That's right! He's left alone and dies! And it's the same with us Our first prayer is a prayer of thanks We have nothing to ask for, we've got everything we need I'll knock 12 times for the light to hear my gratitude - Take a seat - Thanks Please sit down What's going on? - So this is it? - That's right - Do you get a lot of visitors? - Just the local guys - And what do you talk about? - I'm the local bringer of faith - A what? - A bringer of faith - I dance for them - For whom? For everyone interested in my religion Want to see me dance? Take this Give me a beat - What kind? - Doesn't matter Maybe I should sing too? I have no lyrics, but what about this melody? What do you think? Maybe something more melodic? - It's fine. It suits the dance It's great to talk to you. Come, I'll show you the anthill Don't you want to know about home? - How is it? - Great. Tanel has a girlfriend - Pretty? - Plain I better get going - I'll walk with you How does the heating system work? Miku can't figure it out - Miku? Yes, he offered to help It's on automatic You didn't kiss me on the doorstep No! It wouldn't be the same You just couldn't wait Why was the other night so pathetic? - Pathetic? - We were like an old married couple - You said "no funny business" You should've known I didn't mean it. It wasn't the time for gallantry - Why? - Just cuz I was there for your ritual You made it too complicated and you didn't say you're a messenger But your faith was strong - A messenger? And you left out the most important thing A child won't hesitate to throw a tantrum to get what he wants But adults are used to giving up You can have me if you want Take me! Or I'll leave Have your slaves clear up the road! It's a real motherfucker! - Good old Pets! - Hi, Tom Sweet digs you've got here I'm sweating like a pig. I bought this coat especially Breathable fabric my ass! Boy what a trip it is to take the SUV on these roads I did some sick 180s. It's pure speed here Shush! Come listen to this Now you try it - How? - Like it's the door to your sweetheart - You mean Ester? - It's up to you Oh, I've got it Well, was that OK? Very good Just lovely - Anu didn't mention the knocking - So what did she say? - Mentioned the anthills - What else? - That there are ants and stuff - Did you know I'm the messenger? - No, I hadn't heard - I understand everything - Really? - I dance for them - You don't say Sounds cool I better get going Oh, I almost forgot about this - What is it? - I need your signature - Should I read it? - If you like - Give me the gist of it It just makes business easier. Since you're never at the office So I'm giving you my share of the business for the time being? Wonderful. You're a true friend - Well, you've taught me to be charitable - That's right This will only take a second. Just sign each page There's also a paragraph about you being of sound mind - Great. But first, let's do a dance of thanks - Why not I'll knock and you'll dance So I'll...? Nope Yeah Was that OK? Thank you. You're still able to surprise me Give me a pen - Of course Don't you have one? - I don't think so Well, that's 10 years down the drain Fuck Goddamnit! It's this fucking new coat!

My great-grandfather... Zip it! - Come in, please - Yes, I think we will Look, my late father made this table... I told you to shut up! No one cares about your stories What's the weather forecast like? - When the swallows start... - Partially cloudless, variable wind, no rainfall - So how are you? - We've been gathering the light Or was it brightness? - Either one - See, I told you...

What I mean is... you're a very wealthy man - What makes you think that? - We keep our ears open - The mayor put your name in the engine - The search engine And it said - "a very wealthy man, worth millions" And then the missis... me and the missis thought... ...maybe you would be willing to give us... ...spare us... ...about 3000 kroons? - If it's possible What did you have in mind? In mind? Nothing fancy We haven't thought that far - You just want money? - Yes, if it's not too much trouble - 3000 This is kind of a funny story. I gave it all away a few days ago. - Gave it away? - Millions? - Yes, millions - To whom? - To friends who needed it more - Then why are you so happy? Because I'm broke Can you still give us the 3000? Yes, I can Here you go How about another thousand?

You were worth it You never came for those potatoes. I'm dropping them off myself It was freezing, so I lit the stove Don't let it get this way! Why didn't anybody come? - No idea Uugu! They think you've gone cuckoo There's talk that you have burned your money and killed your wife Go on No point in listening to a poor sap But before? You were rich then Rich and worth listening to Rich people know how the world works I heard what you said about the light Old Julius used to rant about something similar It's pretty useless Better call someone a good man or a fine woman That's more than enough Go away, Uugu I understand When my wife hanged herself, I wanted to be alone as well "...what you said about the light..." "...a good man..." "...be alone..." "...Old Julius..." "...I understand..." "...my wife hanged herself..." So... ...you mean to say that... That I take full responsibility for that plane crash and... ...want a life sentence - "Nonsense" - "Out of his mind" Honourable Court There is no record of such a crash in Estonian airspace Look, Mr Jaansoo... ...a person cannot control celestial bodies... ...cannot evoke natural disasters like drought, rain...
