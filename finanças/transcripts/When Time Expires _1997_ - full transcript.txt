[♪♪♪] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [LOUD RUMBLING] -[DOG BARKING] -[SWING SQUEAKING] [♪♪♪] [RATTLING] -[DISTANT DOG BARKING] -[BIRDS CHIRPING] LANDLORD: It's only got one bed. But I suppose one of you fellas could, uh, sleep on the couch. [SUITCASE THUDS] [LOW THUD] [♪♪♪] How much for three days? LANDLORD: Well, I don't usually charge by the day. I rent this place out by the week, or by the month. BLOND MAN: Well, maybe we can work something out. [NOTES RUSTLING] BLOND MAN: What about Travis Beck? Shouldn't he be here already? No, not if they dropped him in the desert. [GUNSHOTS] [GUN COCKS, GUNSHOT] [GUN CLICKS, GUN COCKS] [WIND HOWLING] [♪♪♪] I was just, uh, I was just looking for something. My duffel bag. [SIGHS] Should be around here. That's all right, I see it. Idiots! Total idiots. [HUFFS] -Come here, often? -No. I didn't think so. I'm here almost everyday, and you don't look all that familiar. -Maybe it's just the clothes. -[BREATHES HEAVILY] -[GRUNTS] -So-- Is today laundry day? Or... Look it. I'm just-- [GRUNTS] I'm just trying to get to Langston. Oh! Lanston. Quite a ways off! You got a car? No, actually... I'm gonna walk. [♪♪♪] Oh. [SIGN CREAKS] JUNE: See you in town! [RATTLING] [TV STATIC] [♪♪♪] [ELECTRONIC BUZZING] [TV BUZZES, WHIRS] [MACHINE WHIRRING] [ELECTRONIC BEEPING] -[MUFFLED CHATTER FROM TV] -It's not gonna work. We'll buy another one. -[MACHINE WHIRRING] -[ELECTRONIC BEEPING] -[THUNDER RUMBLING] -[RAINDROPS PATTERING] FEMALE TV ANNOUNCER: You get the whole set, John, plus the kitchen knives for an incredible 14.95. Now, the retail manufacturer's list price is almost three times that! And John, I have to say, that this a truly incredible value. -Now, so many times we see-- -[TV STATIC] [ELECTRONIC BUZZING] FEMALE TV ANNOUNCER: ...really cut through whatever you're eating, because these are serrated. See the edges? And this is all just for 14.95. Now-- You're wrong about me, pal-- [OVERLAPPING MUSIC PLAYING ON TV] ...you won't believe! With virtually no money down, and unlimited financing for qualified buyers. So, question is, "Are you qualified?" Question is, "Are you qualified?" [AUDIO GROWS DISTORTED] "Are you qualified?" "Are you qualified?" -[TV WHIRRING] -[LOUD BEEPING] -[INDISTINCT CHATTER] -[OVERLAPPING BEEPING] -[OVERLAPPING CHATTER ECHOES] -[AUDIO GROWS DISTORTED, FADES] -[MOTOR BIKE SPEEDING OFF] -[RAINDROPS PATTERING] [♪♪♪] [THUNDER CRACKLING] [DISTANT DOG BARKING] [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] [MUFFLED INDISTINCT CHATTER] -[CROWD CHEERING] -[RODEO ANNOUNCER CHATTERING] [NEON SIGN BUZZING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER FROM TV] So that's the great Travis Beck. BARTENDER: Oh, shoot. Doesn't look like a legend to me. What can I get ya? -Nice TV. -[INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT] TRAVIS: Don't suppose you'd wanna sell it. No, but I can sell you a beer. -[POOL BALLS CLACKING] -Fine. Beer's-- beer's fine. Thanks. [INDISTINCT CHATTER FROM TV] Boy just wanted to buy my TV set. JUNE: Hmm. Tell me some more about this naked man you seen. What'd he look like? Big, small? [INDISTINCT CHATTER FROM TV] Oh, I barely remember. -Who's the girl? -[POOL BALL RATTLES] Probably just some local. You know, most people would walk 20 miles just to get out of Lanston. You did it the other way around. -Was it good exercise? -Was what? The walk. Yeah. It stopped raining once I got to the hotel. So, what's the matter with the TV in your room? Bad reception. My, my. -I thought that wasn't allowed. -It's not. If he talks to her, he's breaking the rules. Can I buy you a drink? -No. -[TRAVIS SIGHS] I just don't like people buying me drinks, that's all. Sort of a house rule. -Stayin' in town long? -Three days. You sure that's enough time to see all the sights? -Sure I can't buy you a drink? -No. [CLICKS TONGUE] I'm Travis Beck. -JUNE: June Kelly. -June Kelly. So, what are you really doin' in town? Business, I guess. It's really... I don't know, it's really hard to answer that. Oh, come on. Say anything. Use your imagination. All right. I'm from another planet, here on a secret mission to investigate Earth... for contact with my people. On this other planet of yours... are you married? [CHUCKLES] No. -Not even a girlfriend? -[SIGHS] You know, I'm, uh, I'm not from around here, but, uh... I'd swear you're trying to pick me up. Well, I just said you couldn't buy me a drink. I didn't say you couldn't pick me up. [♪♪♪] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Well, like I said, it has everything. Lamps. Curtains. Chairs. I've been here before. Got the grand tour on prom night. -When I was 17. -True love? [CHUCKLES] No. My boyfriend at the time, Tom, had been complaining for weeks that his truck was getting too small for the size of his affections... so we rented a room here. -Was it worth it? -Not really. After all that talk... Tom just lost his nerve. Among other things. Spent a good hour apologizing for it, too. We just ended up watching TV. We're not gonna watch TV, are we? TRAVIS: No. [BEEPING] [CHUCKLES, SIGHS] [WATCH BEEPING] We can't do this. I'm sorry. Did I do something wrong? No, you didn't do nothing wrong. It's just, uh, it's-- I can't really explain it. That's all. It's all right. I don't need the excuse, just my coat. Normally, it doesn't happen in situations like this. I suppose you have something to say about all this. Well, that's rare. An interface with nothing to say. -[TV BUZZES] -[IN DISTORTED VOICE] We got all makes and models. We got your Chevys, we got your Fords. All at prices you won't believe! -[CLICKS TONGUE] -With virtually no money down, and unlimited financing for qualified buyers. So, the question is, "Are you qualified?" I used to be. [IN DISTORTED VOICE] Well, then, come on down and check out our selection. You won't be disappointed. I guess bad reception wasn't a problem for you? [IN NORMAL TONE] Well... [CHUCKLES] ...I'm one of the M-3 Series, Travis. We got image correction built in! -I can call you Travis, right? -Yeah, sure. Too bad about the girl. But you heard the watch, you know the rules, you did good. Can't change the future. No, sir. Ministry doesn't let anyone change the future without orders. -Not even someone like you. -Uh. I'm tired, all right? Let's keep the chit-chat to a minimum, okay? Oh! Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. You bet. -Just down to the minimum. Down to the essentials-- -I checked the parking meter, and the zone looks clean. Do we have a time yet? Uh. No. The, uh, Ministry wants you to lay low for a while so they can work out a few details, but still looks like three days. Fine. Good night. [♪♪♪] [GROANS, SIGHS] -What? -Oh! I just... wanted to let you know that, uh... it's an honor to work with you. Yeah, me too. Good night. Good night. [TV BUZZES] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [♪♪♪] [FOOTSTEPS RECEDE] [DOOR CREAKS] [BREATHES DEEPLY] You finished aiming, or do you need me to stay still for a minute? [BILL CHUCKLES] Yeah, that's pretty smart talk for a guy who doesn't even lock his door. [SIGHS] Bill, what are you doing here? Not all the natives are friendly, Travis. -[PLACES GUN] -You gotta be more careful. Stay on your toes. I hope you didn't come all this way to talk about my toes. -No, it's a local expression. -I know what it is. And I thought you'd be happy to see your old partner. I am. Now go away. We gotta talk, Travis. It's important. Later. All right. [SIGHS] Breakfast across the street. [GRUNTS] Eight o'clock. Whatever. [DOOR CREAKS, SHUTS] [♪♪♪] -[INDISTINCT CHATTER] -[CUTLERY CLINKING] -Want a menu? -No. I'd like to know how you got authorization to come down here. Oh, I'd like the... eggs and coffee, please. How'd you like those eggs? I guess I'd like that... Well, don't ask him. He doesn't know what he wants. Scrambled. You don't know what you want, do you? No. -[INDISTINCT CHATTER] -[TRAVIS SIGHS] -Mingling with the natives? -I haven't broken any rules. BILL: No, of course not. Look, Travis, I'm not here to harass you. I know what you've been going through. Sending someone like you to a place like this is just... Just what I deserve. I wasn't gonna say that. TRAVIS: So, who sent you? Nobody sent me. I came here to find you! I mean, you totally disappeared. The next thing I hear you're-- you're bumped down to the Ministry of Future Analysis. Like-- like some fourth-class planet investigator. -What's going on? -It was the only job I could get. [KETTLE CLINKS] Thanks. Doing what? A calibration exercise. A what? It's a sequence check. A timeline analysis. Yes, but what are you doing, specifically? In two days, I'm supposed to put a quarter in a parking meter. [CHUCKLES] You're joking! No, that's it. I'm just waiting on word on when to do it. -Here. -[PLATE CLATTERS] I can't believe they have you doing this. The Ministry says if I work as an investigator for a couple of years, keep a low profile, not get into any trouble, then, they'll consider me for-- for real work again Well... I don't know if it's gonna make you feel any better but you're the last investigator they'll be sending here. Why is that? Well, the Ministry endorsed Earth to the League for approval. -Nobody told me about that. -Oh, yeah. Earth is in. [SCOFFS] A year from now, this planet gets the welcome mat to the union of peace and progression. Well, I'm only gonna be here for a couple more days, so, if anyone wants to send me any postcards, they'd better hurry up. They'll be sending flowers to the funeral, Travis. What funeral? I'm talking about your funeral. Your personal death in this tiny town. Somebody hired three assassins to wipe you out, and they're all en route here. [SCOFFS] And you thought this was gonna be an easy assignment. -[CULTERY SCRAPING PLATE] -They do put ketchup on these things, right? [♪♪♪] So, uh, explain this again. Why don't we talk about this funeral thing first? Now, wait a minute. I wanna know what they have you doing here. I told you, I put a quarter in the meter, and I walk away. -[SCOFFS] That's it? -[SIGHS] Now, from what I know so far, there's three of them. They're outer colony mercenaries on early parole from a prison ship. -Any idea who sent them? -[SIGHS] Not yet. Well, they certainly picked a nice, remote place to find me. Yeah. But, you could get lucky. You know, the Ministry was really tight about security when I got here. If it weren't for my rank and position, they would've strip-searched me and... [CHUCKLES] ...sent me naked in the desert. Well, it must be nice to have rank and position. Yeah. Well... I didn't come here to talk about what happened to your career. -No, no, you go ahead. -[TRAFFIC RUSHING BY] [DISTANT DOG BARKING] Now tech security was strict. No fancy hardware allowed. I mean, all they let me land with was that-- that projectile popgun I pulled on you. So I bet even if these guys get clearance to land, they're not gonna have any real weapons with 'em. They did give you a weapon, didn't they? Oh, yeah, a duffel bag, a change of clothes, and a soft toothbrush. [CHUCKLES] Did they give you an interface? Yeah, it's not too bright, but maybe it can help. How long have you worked with it? I just got it. Two days before I was shipped out. I wouldn't trust it. I mean, you don't even know who programmed it. We'll use mine instead. There's gotta be something I can do. [SIGHS] Yeah. Go to the bar and get a drink. I'll call you if I find something. [♪♪♪] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] -Looks like your friend's got a pretty strong stomach. -[BOTTLE CLINKS] -Why? What's he drinkin'? -Everything. [JUNE SIGHS] What's in that, um, green bottle? That's Scotch. -Did I have Scotch yet? -No. Fine. I'll have Scotch. -[GLASS THUDS] -[POURS SCOTCH] -Thanks. -[BOTTLE THUDS] Well, now, he's goin' by the color of the bottles. -Hey. -Hey. This is my bar. I don't need the competition. Look, I thought you stopped talking to me. Well, it's a small town. [SIGHS] -You're gonna get sick. -Not on this stuff. -You sound like my father. -[BOTTLE CLINKS] Look, I'm sorry about last night. -It was my mistake. -You wanna make yourself useful? -Doing what? -Forget what. Can you stand? Can you walk? I can do all sorts of things. I'm sure you can. [FOOTSTEPS RECEDING] [TRUCK ENGINE RUMBLING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] -[CAR DOOR THUDS] -TRAVIS: So, am I being useful yet? You will be when you empty these. -[LOUD GUNSHOT] -[GUN COCKS] -[GUNSHOTS] -[CANS RATTLING] All right. The rest are yours. Ever shot before? Well, um, nothing like this. Nothing special about this. -It's a Remington 760. -[INHALES] -You just... -[GUN COCKS] ...cock it like this before each shot. Good. Keep it tight against the shoulder. Trick is not to pull the trigger. Just squeeze as you breathe out. [GUNSHOT] -[SIGHS] -Actually, the real trick is not to drink 'em all before you shoot at 'em, but it's more fun this way. -[GUN COCKS] -[BULLET RATTLING] -[GUNSHOT, GUN COCKS] -[CAN RATTLING] -[GUNSHOT, GUN COCKS] -[CAN RATTLING] -[GUNSHOT] -[CAN RATTLING] [GUN COCKS] You're a real quick learner. -[♪♪♪] -GUN DEALER: Well, now, what we got here. -[CRICKETS CHIRPING] -Smith and Wesson, .357 magnum. We got a couple of Berreta nine millimeters. Six-shot. .44 Magnum. Glock 17. Now, I can get you 19. My personal favorite, the sawed-off pistol grip 12 gauge shotgun. -And they all just shoot bullets? -[SHOTGUN COCKS] Yeah. They all just shoot bullets. What the hell you boys lookin' for, cannon? We already have a cannon. [GUN COCKS] -[CRICKETS CHIRPING] -[FIRE CRACKLES] -[BOTTLE CLINKS] -[BOTTLECAP CLATTERS] So, um, have you lived in Lanston all your life? [CLICKS TONGUE] Oh, sure. Born here. Raised here I, uh, saw a wheelchair on the back of your truck. My father's. -So he can walk without it? -He likes to think so. [BOTTLE THUDS] Does your mother take care of him? Oh, no. She's gone. She left. I was four. -Can I ask you something? -Yeah. Sure. What happened last night? Oh, my, um, watch isn't a watch. Is there somethin' you want to tell me about your watch? -[SIGHS] -It's okay. You can tell me. You know that, um, "I'm from another planet" story? Well, it isn't a story. [CHUCKLES] Okay. I'm, um... [♪♪♪] I'm a planet investigator, here to perform a timeline analysis of Earth. I, um, I shouldn't be-- I shouldn't be telling you this. No, you go ahead. I'm from the League of Planet Progression. It's-- it's a coalition of about a hundred worlds from every galaxy. They look for ways to bring peace through the alteration of time. Uh-huh. Under the League, there are two departments, okay? Um. The Ministry of Historical Adjustment, which corrects the past, and... the Ministry of Future Analysis which predicts the future. -Okay. -[GRUNTS] I used to work for Historical Adjustments. My partner and I were a repair team to save worlds from future disasters. Wa-- wa-- was he the guy you were with in the diner? The one with the scrambled eggs and the coffee? [SIGHS] Something happened. There was an accident and a trial. I-- I was fired from Historical Adjustment, and... [SIGHS] ...ended up in Future Analysis. So... is... everyone else in these other planets human? Well, most of us are. It's a popular model. What about this... watch of yours that isn't a watch? Um. [GRUNTS, SIGHS] Here. It's a time-flux continuum sensor. FCS standard issue for Ministry agents. It beeps if I'm-- I'm about to make a change I'm not supposed to, or jeopardize my mission. And telling me all this doesn't change the future? Not if it doesn't beep. -[COYOTE HOWLS] -[TRAVIS SIGHS] I, um, I thought you weren't gonna look away, or get quiet on me. I-- I'm not. It's-- it's just-- it's gettin' late. Can you drive? Sure. -[CRICKETS CHIRPING] -[ENGINE RUMBLING] [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] So, I guess you didn't believe me. -[SIGHS] -Well, I can prove it. What? You're gonna show me your space ship? No, you-- you just have to kiss me. I'm not gonna kiss you. Listen, for some reason, I'm not supposed to have any real contact with you. Maybe it changes things. Maybe affects my mission. I don't know. But what I do know, it sets my watch off. -I'm still not gonna kiss you. -You've already kissed me! But that's before I knew you belong in a mental institution. Well. Oh. Now I'm insane. Great. All right. One kiss. -Pull over. -Forget it. Just pull over. -[KEYS JINGLING] -[MUSIC SHUTS OFF] So, what kinda kiss are we talkin' about? Well, it's-- it's late, and I-- I have to get back to the asylum. Shut up. Well... I don't hear anything. [SIGHS] Well... Maybe it's not just about the kiss, that sets it off. It... it might be about the intensity. Okay. Let's try this. [SMOOCHING] [WATCH BEEPING] [WATCH BEEPING] [WATCH BEEPING] Well, I'll be damned. -[KEYS JINGLING] -[CAR ENGINE TURNS OVER] [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] So, you're supposed to put a quarter in this meter in two days. Something to do with a parking ticket. No wonder you're drinking. That's a lot of responsibility. I think I should go now. Um. Can you drive? Yes. I can drive! So, you wanna, um, you think you wanna have breakfast in the morning? You know where to find me. [TRUCK DOOR OPENS, SHUTS] [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] Yeah. [♪♪♪] [FOOTSTEPS RECEDING] [TV BEEPS, WHIRS] [IN DISTORTED VOICE] Hey, partner. What are you looking at? You know, I'm just an M-3 series. I wasn't designed to be real smart, but, uh, I can tell when something's wrong. Two days before I shipped out... they replaced my usual interface with you. -No reason. No explanation. -Oh, that, well... -Don't you trust me? -No. Well, I wasn't gonna tell you this, but, uh, two days before you shipped out, your usual interface quit. Mm-hmm. That's right. It quit. It asked to be reassigned 'cause it didn't wanna work with you, and there wasn't an interface in the whole Ministry that would. Except me. I volunteered 'cause... I never believed that damned scandal, and I never thought you were guilty. So I didn't give a damn if I was branded as a murder's sidekick. You have access to Ministry prediction files, don't you? Yeah. Some. I wanna know more about by mission here. I wanna know more about this parking meter. You mean you wanna know what changes the Ministry predicts will happen after you put the quarter in? No. I wanna know what happens if I don't. Follow that parking ticket. Any events that follow. I wanna know who's supposed to get it, who gives it. Everything that happens because of it. Well, I... [GRUNTS] I think that's classified. Then un-classify it. Break in. Pretend you're another computer. -Lie. Cheat. Steal. -But... [MUMBLES] You wanna be a murderer's sidekick, don't you? -Yeah! Uh. I guess. -Then get me those files. -Oh, Lordy. -[DOOR OPENS] You're gonna fry our ass for this. [DOOR SHUTS] [TV BUZZES, WHIRS] -EVANGELIST ON TV: And I could feel his... -[TV PLAYING CHURCH MUSIC] -BILL: Yeah? -Yeah, it's me. -All right. I got good news and bad news. -[EVANGELIST CONTINUES CHATTING] -Give me two minutes, will you? -He discovered that his wife had been living a life of sin! She felt it was best to lie to him. But when she lied to him, she lied to God! -For nothing so hurts the love of God... -Is there nothing else on TV? -...than when we escape the truth. -[TAP SQUEAKS] -[SHOWER RUNNING] -The truth with ourselves, and to God... is sacred! Why don't you check your records? I was in adjustments. HAS1146. -[MUSIC FADES] -I know who you are, Travis Beck. Well, you could've said somethin'. Bill and I have a difference of opinion about you. Oh, really? I feel you have disgraced the Ministry. You have committed the greatest sin that any man can ever commit. Well, you're a friendly interface, aren't you? You betrayed the trust of your department. You altered the unalterable. Now the voices of pain still cry out for justice. -[TAP SQUEAKS] -Look, I just asked... -[SHOWER SHUTS OFF] -...if there was anything on TV. I didn't ask for another trial. Well, you are on trial here. Here on Earth. Here to pay for your forgotten sins. -Hey! Cut it out! -[HITS TV] I was just about to change the channel. Sorry about that. It just picked that station by itself. Tell him what you found. EVANGELIST: Well, Bill suggested that I check the SK system for flight records. Now, outside of Bill and yourself, no other landing requests have been approved. However, in the past 48 hours, three requests have been denied. Give him the reason. EVANGELIST: Well, the passengers violated Article 422. They refused hardware inspection. Like I said, no fancy stuff allowed. You lucked out. [SHAVING CAN SQUIRTING] I guess I know what the bad news is. Well, these guys were probably armed to the teeth. They're not foolin' around with me, are they? Hey, Travis. You were the Ministry hot shot. They're not takin' any chances. Oh, boy. [HISSES] Can you believe these things? No wonder these people need help. So... look, it's not over yet. What do you say you and I go for a drink? Yeah, sure. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] -[POOL BALLS CLACKING] -[INDISTINCT CHATTER] -[JUKEBOX CLICKS] -MAN AT BAR: Cowabunga! [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] [CHUCKLES] Look at them. -[TRAVIS SIGHS] -Hitting balls with sticks. Throwing pointed objects. It's hard to believe the Ministry approved a place this. You're a planet snob. Well... So, what about you and this waitress? I met her in the desert. -Spending any time with her? -Little bit. You think that's a good idea? Probably not. It seems you oughta be a little more careful, that's all. So, what're you gonna do, report me? [SCOFFS] Of course not. It's just that dating the locals is hardly Ministry protocol, is it? Look, if I bend the rules a bit to keep me from going insane, I don't need you quoting me the book. -Maybe my interface was right. -Oh, come on. Meaning what? Meaning maybe you are on trial, to see if you can still follow the rules. -[SIGHS] -BILL: I better go back and get to work... -[BOTTLE THUDS] -...saving your ass. [JUKEBOX CLICKS] Looks like his buddy, Bill, left with some angry words. Maybe they're not friends anymore. [POOL BALLS CLACKING] [SIGHS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey. Can I buy you a drink? No. I already got one. Maybe you'd like a stool to sit down on. No. I'm standin' just fine. Is the hotel comfortable? You having a good time up there? Let me guess. You're a friend of June's. TOM: No, you see, I'm more than a friend, and you got her drunk, and you took advantage of her, you dumb shit! Look, buddy. If you like June, that's great. If you love June, that's great too. Just leave me out of it. Why don't we take this outside? -[CASH REGISTER CLINKS] -[TRAVIS INHALES] [BOTTLES CLINKING] [BREATHES DEEPLY] Fine. [FOOTSTEPS RECEDING] All right. Let's get this over with. [TRUCK RATTLING] -[GRUNTS] -MAN: Whoo! Get him, Tom! All right. [BREATHES HEAVILY] [GRUNTS, GROANS] -[TRAVIS GRUNTS] -[YELLS, GRUNTS] -[GRUNTS] -[GRUNTS] -[TOM GRUNTS] -[SHOTGUN COCKS] Let him go, friend. Nice and easy. -[WATCH BEEPING RAPIDLY] -[PANTS, GRUNTS] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] WALTER: About time you got dinner. -[GRUNTS] -[CUTLERY SCRAPING BOWL] Only in town for three days, huh? What? That fella you talked about. Yeah. I think so. Where'd he say he was from? Think he said he was from New York. [TELEPHONE RINGING] -[PICKS UP PHONE] -JUNE: Hello? No, now's not a good time. When? All right, bye. [FOOTSTEPS] He's in jail. Nothin' but trouble, June. That kinda man always is [FOOTSTEPS RECEDING] PRISONER: I ain't drunk anymore, Sheriff. You can let me out now. I'm dry as a bone. [CELL DOOR OPENS] [CELL DOOR SHUTS] -JUNE: Thanks. -[CELL DOOR LOCKS] -[FOOSTEPS RECEDING] -PRISONER: Let me speak to my lawyer, Sheriff. I'm sorry about what happened. Tom and I dated once in high school. He can get a little overprotective. Guess he never got over prom night. [SIGHS] I talked to the Sheriff. He says you aren't cooperating. Not even tellin' him your name. In fact, he says you're not talkin' at all. -Well, aren't you even gonna talk to me? -[PRISONER COUGHING] Oh! Your watch. Jesus. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [GRUNTS] June, I told you his watch is in the property room along with his wallet and keys. And that's where it's all gonna stay, unless he starts talking. Look, Tom's the one who should be in jail. I haven't been able to have a man buy me a drink in years because of Tom. June, why don't you just marry Tom, and put him out of his misery? Can't you see the boy likes you? He's been pining for you for years. Now I'm not just saying this because he's my son. But I think you should give him a second chance. If you could just give this man his watch back, I'm... sure he'd be very talkative. He's got a thing about his watch. It means a lot to him. -[CHAIR SQUEAKS] -[SIGHS] Deputy. Get this man his watch. -[CRICKETS CHIRPING] -[TRUCK DOOR OPENS] [CAR RUSHING BY] I didn't have to come here, you know. [SIGHS] I owe you one. Why do you do this to yourself? What's the matter with you? It's a Ministry rule. If you lose the watch, you don't talk. You never know if what you say might change the future. -I don't even know why I asked. -[KEYS JINGLING] [TRUCK ENGINE TURNS OVER] [♪♪♪] -[KEYS JINGLING] -[DOOR CREAKS] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [TRAVIS SIGHS] I guess I don't have to tell you, they were here. [SIGHS] Came down about an hour ago to tell you what I found. [SIGHS] I saw this. Too bad about your interface. Where were you? Around. You know what they were looking for? No. Well, I finally got our information from the private sector. Seems our assassins hired an EDS drop ship. Two of them were here even before you landed. -What about Ministry security? -You know the Ministry. They said, well, we can't be responsible for every speck of dust that falls from the sky. But they are organizing a committee to look into it. What about the third man? There's a second drop ship coming into the sector tomorrow. My bet is it's the leader's. I mean, that's why they haven't moved on you. [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] You want my advice? Sure. Forfeit the mission. Get out while you can. I can't do that. You gotta face it, Travis. You're not a top Ministry agent anymore. You're a fourth-class investigator. They're not gonna lift a finger to protect you. I can't leave here. [SIGHS] It's about the scandal, isn't it? [SIGHS] Look, there's no shame in what you did. Look... if these men want to kill me for what I've done, then I'm staying right here. Only a guilty man runs... and I'm not guilty. [SIGHS] You don't have to stay here. This isn't your fight. I just need your gun. [DOOR SHUTS] [ENGINE RUMBLING] [♪♪♪] This one here's a pretty good deal. I need something with a sharp picture, and an "F" type connector. Oh, you mean cable-ready. -Does this one work? -Sure. Let you have that one for 150, since I haven't got the remote for it. [TRAVIS SIGHS] All I got is 120. All right. You know, you don't hear too many people calling that -an "F" connector. -[CASH REGISTER DINGS] Was a couple of guys in here the other day, though. Called it the same thing you did. Did they just move into town? Oh, I don't know about moving in. I think they just rented a place down here. Across from the hotel. [TV STATIC BUZZING] [TV BUZZES, WHIRS] -[LOUD THUD] -[TV BUZZES, WHIRS] [CURRENT BUZZES] -[TV BUZZES, WHIRS] -[CURRENT BUZZES] Jesus Christ! What the hell is going on here? I was gonna ask you the same question. Well, the guys who broke in here weren't local sons of bitches. Knew I was here! Flipped me over from behind, then yanked the plug. Even tried to take me with them, but I gave 'em about 220 volts, that changed their goddamned mind. Did you get the files I wanted? No. I didn't get any files you wanted. I was attacked. You're not inspiring me with trust. Well, I got a little show for you. This is the last five seconds I saw before I was unplugged. Now, watch that mirror just over your bed there. There's a nice, little reflection of the room. [CHUCKLES] Now, take a look at this. [TV BEEPS] -I can't see a damned thing. -Hold on, hold on for a little image correction, huh? [ELECTRONIC BEEPING, CHIMING] -[ELECTRONIC BEEPING] -CAR SALESMAN: Not bad for an M-3, huh? Now run a check with every prison ship you can get access to. I wanna match this face with every parole order in the last few weeks. That I can do. Has the Ministry made up its mind on this parking meter? Well, they just gave the order. The quarter goes in at exactly 8:01 in the morning. Good work -Trust me yet? -Get me those Ministry files. [TV BUZZES, WHIRS] [♪♪♪] [DOOR CREAKS] -[TAPS SQUEAKS] -[WATER RUNNING] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [CUTLERY CLINKING] My father told me not to talk to you anymore. That's understandable. Don't get excited, but there's two men at the back table wearing the same watch as you. [SLURPS, SIGHS] -[SLURPS] -Friends of yours? -[CUP CLINKS] -[TRAFFIC RUMBLING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Okay, I'll try and keep this simple. This is a small town, but until your glorious leader comes, this is my town. So if you pigs want to get a cup of coffee, I suggest you go someplace else. Do you understand what I'm saying? I'm sorry. Maybe you boys didn't ace the English test. I said get out of here. [BEEPING] That's what I thought. You're not allowed to make a scene, but I will. Now if your leader comes in tonight, you tell him to meet me across the street at the bar. -We'll meet on the bridge. -[BLOND MAN SIGHS] [DINER DOORBELL DINGS] [DOOR CREAKS] I, um, think I might need some target practice. [GUNSHOTS] So, who were those guys? [BULLETS RATTLING] For once, you're not being very talkative about things. -Dad wants you to have dinner with us tonight. -[REVOLVER CLICKS] It's not a big thing. -Our house is ten minutes from town. -[SIGHS] Look... he didn't ask me for anything. He asked for this. And it'd mean a lot to me if you came. All right. All right. [CICADAS CHIRPING] [CUTLERY CLINKING] June tells me you were in jail. Just a bar fight. A misunderstanding. -[KNIFE SCRAPING PLATE] -Ain't nothing to misunderstand about Tom. Boy's been an idiot all his life. June, honey, is there anymore of this corn? Sure. So, you're leaving tomorrow? Yeah. I gotta get back to New York. Go back to work. -Travel a lot? -A bit. Hmm. Dad used to travel a lot. Four time all-around rodeo champ. All these trophies are his. -Steak okay, Dad? -Is there any salt? Forgot. You want a beer, Travis? No, I'm fine. Thanks. Yeah. I used to live for these trophies. Had myself quite a reputation for a while. That's how I met my wife. But then, life has a sense of humor every now and then. Ten years of rodeoing, and I break my back in a car accident. Trying to buy a carton of milk. Amazing how a carton of milk can ruin a man's life. [SIGHS] June, honey, I'd like to talk to Travis alone for a while. Dad, Travis has to be somewhere later. It's okay. I can talk. It's all right. -[FOOTSTEPS RECEDING] -[DOOR SHUTS] You are so full of shit. Excuse me? You never laid eyes on New York, and... I think you travel a lot. I... I don't know what you mean. Sure you do. June says you wouldn't talk in jail till you got your watch back. Now if that ain't Ministry protocol, I don't what is. I don't wear mine anymore. It's almost thirty years old, and barely tells the time. But I still keep it upstairs just for laughs. I thought the Ministry stopped sending investigators to Lanston. -What department were you in? -Future analysis. Fourth class. -Does June know? -WALTER: No. Came here to raise a family, start a new life, not confuse one. How did it happen? Same way it always does. I fell in love. I wasn't anybody with the League, but I thought I could be someone here. So, I petitioned the Ministry. Filed an RJ-11 dismissal. Eventually they gave it to me. Things didn't work out like I wanted. People should stay where they belong. So, why'd you bring me here? I want you to take June with you. There's nothing I can do about that. My daughter doesn't belong here. But she won't leave this town 'cause she doesn't think I can take care of myself. Well, I can. -I think June just wants to be happy here. -Bullshit. I've watched that little girl spend her entire life trying to be happy. Trying to figure out who she was, and where she belongs. But she can't, because she's different. She's half of what we are! Explorer and traveler. It's in her blood. And I don't want her paying for my mistakes anymore. Now, you're a Ministry agent. You got connections. People you can talk to. Favors you can ask for. You can make this happen for her. I don't have any connections. I don't have anybody I can talk to. Nobody's gonna do me any favors. There was a time when I... when I could've done something for her but... but not anymore. Not here. You got problems with the Ministry? -I got all sorts of problems. -Why don't you tell me about 'em? There's nothing you can do. You best let me decide what I can do. [♪♪♪] -[DOG BARKING] -[CRICKETS CHIRPING] Sorry about that. Sometimes he just likes to feel like he's in control. No, that's all right. -He just loves you very much. -[SCOFFS] [SNIFFLES] Before the accident, we were gonna open a riding school here. We'd both teach it together. Well... it's getting late. Drive back. Yeah. [CAR ENGINE RUMBLING] I... I can't see you anymore. Well, I won't let this drag out too long. Here. I know you probably have one of your own, but... if you're really gonna do this thing, I wanted you to use mine. [SIGHS] You, um, you can't come near the hotel in the morning. Promise me that. All right. [KISSES] Good bye, June. [♪♪♪] [TRUCK ENGINE GROWS DISTANT] [♪♪♪] RADIO ANNOUNCER: It's 8:15, looks like it's gonna rain again tonight, so here's a tune for all you lonely truckers out there. [MUSIC PLAYING] MALE SINGER ON RADIO: ♪ She used to hold me ♪ ♪ Sometimes, she'd scold me ♪ ♪ To tell me when things Wasn't right ♪ -You can't do that. -♪ Here she'd date me ♪ -Why not? -♪ Now, she berates me ♪ -Because that's not how the game is played. -♪ My mother ♪ -You have to follow the rules. -♪ My sister, my wife ♪ ♪ She used to change me ♪ -♪ Now she complains me ♪ -I don't see why we can't just kill him right now. -♪ All night... ♪ -Because we have to follow the rules. -♪ I bring home the bacon to her bellyachin' ♪ -[DOOR CREAKS OPENS] ♪ She's my lover ♪ RIFKIN: Heard you boys were looking for some real weapons. -[LOUD THUD] -RIFKIN: Turn that radio off. Let's get to work. -[TV BUZZES, WHIRS] -[GROANS] I don't think raiding the Ministry's prediction files was such a good idea. Why, what happened? I did like you said. I lied, and I cheated and I stole, and I got in for about three seconds before they cut me off. -So, you didn't get anything. -[SIGHS] No. I got something. You better take a look. Now you see all these? These are visual representation of all the future files I got. Everything involving that damned parking meter for the next year. -Look at 'ern! -Stop. Don't panic. Aw, but I don't even know what the hell I'm looking for! I don't even know where to begin! Well, I do, and we'll take it step-by-step. OTHER MAN: Not bad. Looks sort of like a T-88 short-range disrupter. RIFKIIN: Yeah, but this model just burns flesh. [♪♪♪] It's so nice to see boys smiling when they have the right toys. Lady, we didn't come here to play with toys. Of course not. We have special orders for you, darlings. Now let's talk about that parking ticket. CAR SALESMAN: The man who gets the parking ticket tomorrow is Hal Fansten. Now, he owns a hardware store in town. He gets the ticket at 8:01 a.m., and he decides to fight it in court. His hearing is in one week. He loses the case, he pays the ticket, then he goes home. Month later, he sells the car. Two months after that, he buys a new one. -Now, there's no major change in this man's life, or-- -Stop. All right? -Why does he sell the car? -Travis... people on this planet like cars. They change 'em all the time. But people on this planet don't live two months without one. -Not without a reason. -All right. All right. I'm checking. I'm checking. Well. Apparently, our Mr. Fanston... has a little financial trouble. Sells the car to pay for a lawyer. Seems like there's a lawsuit here. Nothing ever seems to happen with, though. -I think the charges are dropped. -Follow the lawsuit. Some women trips on his briefcase, and sues him for negligence. -At the courthouse. -What? She trips at the courthouse on the same day where he fights the ticket. Eh, well, looks like you're right. Uh... [CLICKS TONGUE] That's where she falls, falls down the stairs, and in the hospital. -Follow the woman. -She's a Belinda Hosworth, wife of a Texas Senator, Raymond Hosworth. -A senator. -Oh, well, he don't seem to amount to much. He loses the election next year. Does he visit her in the hospital? Look, I only got access to future predictions, like tickets, uh, court cases, hospital bills. I can't really tell you if the man was a good husband! On the day she was admitted to the hospital, is there any record of what the... what the husband did? I have a record of what he didn't do. He, uh, he was supposed to be in Congress voting on a bill. What was the bill? Uh. Raising the nuclear security budget. -And what was the vote? -Defeated by one. His? Yeah. [SIGHS] You rotten apple, don't let him get away! -[GRUNTING] -[GUNSHOT] -[HORSES GALLOPING] [KNOCKING] [♪♪♪] I didn't think you'd still be here. Yeah, well, I stayed in case you changed your mind. -[TV BUZZES, WHIRS] -[CRICKETS CHIRPING] Well, well, if it isn't the heretic. -[LOUD BUZZ] -[CABLE RATTLES] Something on your mind? I don't think those men were sent to kill me. I don't... I don't know. I don't think they came here on vacation. Now you said Earth was already accepted by the League, right? Right. So, when does the welcoming committee arrive? About a year. And they'll probably have 1,500 ships and diplomats with them. What if Earth wasn't here? Well, what do you mean, not here? What I'm saying is, what if Earth's a dead planet? A dust ball. Uh... Destroyed by some future nuclear accident. Well... [SIGHS] I think the Ministry would be able to predict something like that. What if they didn't? What if they just figured it out? [CLICKS TONGUE, SIGHS] I'm guessing they'd have a lot of explaining to do. Forget explaining. It would be political suicide. Everything would shut down. People fired. Heads would roll. So, you're saying, what? That the Earth is gonna self-destruct before the year is over? I think the Ministry made a big mistake about Earth's future, and they're tying to cover it up by changing it. And just how would they go about covering up something like that? By doing something small. Something routine. Something no one would notice. Like putting a quarter in a parking meter. [CLICKS TONGUE] Right. So, they sent you to do this one last calibration exercise, which in reality, sets off a series of events -which save the planet. -And saves everybody's job. [LAUGHS] Come on, Travis! They send three killers across the entire galaxy for that? Listen, if the League wanted to stop you, they'd just cancel the mission. -They don't need a death squad for that. -[GLASS CLINKS] But the League wants proof of a conspiracy. So, they sent these men to find out what you know? No, they sent you. The assassins were just back-up. [♪♪♪] What? Sure, Bill. Small town. My life in danger. You come down here to warn me. My ex-partner. Someone I trust. Asking questions. Of course, I'd tell you if I was part of a Ministry plot. Did you work this out yourself, or did you get some help from your interface? My interface saw one of these men, Bill. It matched a face on a parole order. And your name was on it. Your name was on that order. I just need to know why. You know, Travis... I think you're taking your theory a little too far, and I'm not liking it. -[CHUCKLES] -[WATCH BEEPING] [♪♪♪] Just tell me it's not true. [RAPID BEEPING] -[WATCHES BEEPING] -[BOTTLE CLINKS] [GUNSHOTS] -[THUNDER RUMBLING] -[CRICKETS CHIRPING] [BEEPING SLOWS DOWN] -[BEEPING FADES] -[WIND HOWLING] [♪♪♪] -[CRICKETS CHIRPING] -[DISTANT COYOTES HOWLING] [STREAM GURGLING] Where's Bill? He's dead. [FOOTSTEP APPROACHING] You know, the League said they wanted you dead. I thought it was a mistake. Some kind of a joke. I mean, you were almost a hero. But then again, the scandal took care of that, didn't it? You boys want to hear about... the famous Travis Beck? Beck and his buddy Bill were sent back in time to stop some solar experiments. Experiment that was supposed to make some sun go supernova. Apparently, Travis here made a mistake. Something couldn't be fixed, and that sun... -[CLOUDS RUMBLING] -...it blew up real good. And all those planets, and all those people died with it. [CHUCKLES] I didn't come here for a history lesson. Wasn't your fault, Beck. It was Bill who made that mistake. And the League has evidence to prove it. He pinned it on you to save his own career. So, the League sent Bill here, or they'd release the evidence. That was the idea, but you killed him. Now it's our job to find out about this meter. Come on, Beck. We're going to kill you before you put that quarter in, so just tell use what that does. Give us something we can prove in court, and we'll let you live. The League releases the evidence. You become a hero again. Get your old job back, your rank, everything. And the proof you need is to see Earth's real future if I don't put that quarter in. It's that simple? What if I wanted to take somebody off planet? We can't authorize that. The League has to show that we didn't alter anything. Everything has to remain... as is. I need time. You got until midnight. -[THUNDER RUMBLING] -[RAIN POUNDING] RADIO ANNOUNCER: Well, folks, we got ourselves another storm out there. If you're driving home tonight, I'd be careful, it is a mess, -and I mean a big one. -[DOOR CREAKS] RADIO ANNOUNCER: We got 1-40 closed between Amarillo and Route 287. We've had a couple of nasty spills. -A big rig north of Lanston... -The lock was busted, so I waited. -Waited for what? -RADIO ANNOUNCER: ...piled up. Two people are critically injured, and police is still tryin' to clear the mess over there. I heard they're trying to bring in the rescue... [RADIO ANNOUNCER SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] I don't usually wear this shade of lipstick. You think it's too dark? June, I don't know what you think you're doing here, but you can't stay here. -[THROWS LIPSTICK] -Is that a Ministry rule? No, this is, uh, this is my rule. [SIGHS] [THUNDER RUMBLING] Recognize this? It's my father's Ministry watch. Standard issue for 1968. No. He said you probably wouldn't recognize it. -Before your time I guess. -[THROWS WATCH] TRAVIS: He told you? Oh, yeah. You just thought you and that watch of yours could tiptoe through our little town and not change a thing, right? So much for your little plan, Travis. Look, I understand how this must-- You're gonna ruin everything for me, take it all the way. Don't just send me home with a kiss on the cheek. Give me something worth remembering. -[CAR ENGINE RUMBLING] -[RADIO ANNOUNCER CHATTERING ON RADAIO] ...and remember, stay home, be safe, and enjoy this song.

Have you gone deaf? Didn't you hear the watch? That was a mission jeopardy alarm. -My mission was in jeopardy before I even got down here. -[GRUNTS] All you gotta do is tell these guys what you know about the meter. I'm not gonna tell them a goddamned thing. Oh, sweet Mary, Mother of Jesus! [BREATHES DEEPLY] You've gotta tell them! You can't beat these guys with a goddamned .38 revolver! [PANTS] We'll see about that. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [♪♪♪] Now, listen to me. You forget about that meter, and put that gun down. You wanna save planets? Fine. There's lots of planets out there. Good ones, worth saving. But don't risk your life for Earth! I want you to send a message to the Ministry. Tell 'em I know everything about the meter, and I'm ready to negotiate my terms.
