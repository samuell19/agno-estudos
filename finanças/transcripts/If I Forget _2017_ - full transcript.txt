You're about to see a play as it was written and performed onstage. Some may find the language or content objectionable. Viewer discretion is advised. Next on "Theater Close-Up"... Happy birthday... Meet the Fishers. They're a family just like yours. This is nice, all of us here! And when they get together, no topic is off limits. Religion, God, Judaism. Everybody is religious now? So what? You don't believe in anything. You're a hypocrite. It's family drama at it's finest as Roundabout Theatre Company presents "If I Forget." What happens when the last person who remembers can't remember anymore? I don't think it warrants actual glasses. There are no abstractions anymore. And pull up your pants. You look like a thug. I am a thug. Support for "Theater Close-Up" is provided by... To state the task is to suggest the magnitude of the challenge. Behind the Israeli-Palestinian conflict lie the most profound questions. At the Western Wall in Jerusalem, Jewish reactions to the Camp David Summit were mostly positive. However, Palestinian response to the talks was not as positive... ...stating that he doesn't see any benefit from... Great! Great. What is so great? Great! Oh, my God. She says it's completely safe. She feels completely safe. She's incorrect. I'm sorry. Well, because he's worried about you, honey. Is she watching the news? He says if you saw the news here -- Tell her to turn on the news. No, we don't want you to be scared, honey. Of course we want her to be scared. How can she not be scared? The entire peace process collapsed three days ago. The peace process is very bad right now, honey. Peace process is over. The peace process is over. The entire Oslo framework is out the window. They have security 24 hours a day. They should have security. That's a given. She says the Birthright people, they don't let them visit anywhere that isn't 100% safe. Where are they going tomorrow? Well, honey, where are you going tomorrow? The Wailing Wall! Excuse me? Well, you should be excited. She is not doing that. Tell her she is not going there, Ellen. Dad is so excited for you to go there. He's jumping up and down. Oh, well, everyone wishes you were here too, honey, but we're so happy you're having such a good time. Don't tell her I'm happy. I'm very unhappy. Well, it does feel a little bit strange being here. It feels -- It's very quiet without Grandma. Let me talk to her. Do you want to say hi to Dad before... Well, just a quick... Can I have the phone, please? Okay, well, we have the cellphone in case anything -- in case you need to get us for anything. You're not gonna give me the phone? Okay. Love you, too. Bye, sweetheart. She's gonna call us tomorrow night after they check in to the next hotel. She didn't want to talk to me? I think she heard everything you wanted to say, Michael. Good. And she was running out the door. Her friends were gonna leave without her. They're doing a moonlight tour of Jerusalem. Oh, perfect. You know, she could be spending this whole trip sitting in her hotel room by herself. She's going out with people. She's doing all the activities. I guess I just still don't really understand why we had to send our daughter to Israel in the most -- the worst time to be in the Middle East in the last 25 years. We didn't send our daughter anywhere. She's 19 years old. She can make her own decisions. Yeah, well, except this was a decis-- you did happen to encourage this particular decision. The doctor told us this would be the best thing for her, socialize with -- meeting people her own age. That's called an internship. That's a summer job at an ice cream parlor. That's not a 10-day bus ride through a war zone. It's not a war zone. Not yet. You know, this means a lot to her to be there, and, frankly, I don't think it's the worst thing in the world for a teenager to be interested in learning more about her heritage. Okay. And you being the Jewish parent here, I would think maybe you might appreciate that. Heritage is act-- That's actually -- That's a very problematic concept, first of all. Okay, can we just... She's having a good time, thank God, so can we please just try to be happy that she's happy for a second? Is she sleeping? Is she? Yes, Michael, she is. You asked her that? I didn't need to ask her that. I trust her to tell us if there's a problem. So she's eating? She's def-- She's taking her medication? Yeah, I would've heard it in her voice if something was going on. Well, that hasn't -- Historically, that hasn't always been the case. You know what? Right now I think you're upset about other things, Michael, okay? And you're putting all that negative energy onto Abby. What other things? Look, it's perfectly normal to feel like -- I feel fine. I'm fine. It's good that we're here. It means a lot to your dad to have you. Did he say that? I could tell. Why don't you go spend some time with him before everyone else gets here? I'm only halfway through "The Galleys." It's his birthday. His birthday is Tuesday. The two of you have a lot to talk about. I have to send "The Galleys" back by Monday. I have a deadline, Ellen. Don't do this to me. Do what? What you always do when we're at your parents' house -- lock yourself in this room, pretending you have work to do, and I'm stranded downstairs trying to entertain your family. I do not always do that. I have occasionally done that. Yeah. It is quiet, though, isn't it? I didn't notice. When I told Abby -- When I said, "Dad wishes you were leaving Israel and coming home," you know what she said? She said, "I already am home." Huh. She still hasn't called you? Yeah, I wish she would. Are you hearing this? It's been a year, and she can't pick up a telephone? I heard. Every time I talk to her, I say -- I must've said it 100,000 times. Howard, what do I say every time I talk to Jennifer? "Call your aunt and uncle!" "Call Michael and Ellen. You live in the same city." We'd love to see her, show her the new place. Oh, my God. That's right, the new apartment! How is it? I need pictures. Where are my pictures? We can send you pictures. Is it safe? Do you feel safe? In Park Slope? I thought... I thought Michael said Brooklyn? Well, it is Brooklyn. It's a neighborhood in Brooklyn. And that's safe? It's very safe. Yeah, better value, too, I bet, Brooklyn, eh? Oh, well, Manhattan was no-- We could never afford that. Oh, my God. I couldn't believe it when Michael told me you two were buying. I didn't think you'd ever buy. Well, it just felt like the right time with Michael's career and Abby away at school. Mm. Welcome to the wonderful world of homeownership. Well, anytime Jennifer would like to visit, we'd be thrilled to have her. Oh, my God. She's so wrapped up in herself. One year at Tisch, and she's already -- She thinks she's Helen Hunt. Ah, so she's liking it? What's not to like? They play games. They sing songs. They cry. We're paying $40,000 a year for Montessori school. Well, I'm sure it's a great experience. Mm. What about Abby? And hows Middlebury? What a phenomenal school that is. You know, she really -- Her classes are terrific. She loves her classes. Of course she does. Socially, it's still -- I think it's been a little bit of an adjustment for her. Oh, no. No, no, no, just in terms of, you know, she doesn't have a million friends yet or -- Oh, no! No, no, you know, we've been struggling with the same things with her since the third grade. The eating? She's had, yeah, issues with, you know, body image and -- Eating. College, I think, has exacerbated certain things, being away from home for the first time maybe? Absolutely. That's not easy. She was in the hospital for a week in November. Sharon told me. Oh, my God. Awful. I didn't know that. And she's such a beautiful girl is the irony, isn't it? Well, she's doing better now. Second semester, much better. She's really started to get into the groove, I think, finally. Knock on wood. And she's gotten very involved with Hillel, which has been great. Fabulous. Great. Yeah, she really -- She started going to the Shabbat dinners and the holiday services. Fabulous idea. No, I know. She got very excited about learning more about Judaism and the culture and the history. It's been very... Well, I think it's been really great for her to find something that she's so passionate about. Aww! She's a good girl. How's Joey? Is he doing okay? He's doing great. He was suspended for two weeks. Where the hell is Michael? We've been sitting here for 20 minutes. Oh, he's upstairs working. I think he's a workaholic, you know that? Oh, he's -- It's nonstop. It's like Howard. Howard's like that. Well, it's been a busy year. And Michael is teaching three classes in the fall, and on top of that, his new book is coming out in a few months, which is what's making him really -- I mean, he's obsessing over it, every detail. I didn't know Mike was writing a book. Eh, the last time I tried to read something Michael wrote, I couldn't understand anything he's talking about. It's so convoluted, the way he writes. Well, this new book is actually -- It's a lot less academic, so we're hoping it's more accessible than his usual writing, sells more copies, which is, you know, any copies. What about your job? Do you still love it? Love is a pretty strong word. There are times when it's -- I mean, when you feel like you're really making a difference. I couldn't do what you do if you paid me a million dollars, Ellen. Well, it's important for children to have advocates, even if it isn't always pleasant. I have a buddy. His sister was a social worker out in Anacostia in the housing projects there. The things she was doing with those people -- I mean, heroic. Oh, I'm sure. Yeah. She ended up -- She killed herself, actually. Oh, look who's here. Were you talking about me? I heard my name. Well, you heard wrong. Say hello to your Aunt Ellen. Hi, Aunt Ellen. Hello. Hey, pull up your pants. No one wants to see your underwear. Can I have another iced tea? I'm thirsty. All the boys at his school now, this is what they do. I mean, look at this one, pants around his butt. He thinks it's attractive. Can I have another iced tea now? You just had one. I'm thirsty, though. My mouth is, like, completely dried out. Well, you can drink water. You don't need more sugar. I don't like the water here. It tastes bad. Grandpa doesn't have a filter. Where is Grandpa? I thought you two were watching the baseball game together. He fell asleep. Uh-oh. You must've worn him out, Joey. Is Abby coming today? Aww! He loves his cousin. Abby is actually in Israel right now. On Birthright? Oh, you know about Birthright? One of my friend's cousins did it. Oh, great. He got blowjobs from all the girls on the trip. Hey! Oh! Is that how we talk? He did, though. Well, we're hoping that Abby's trip is a little less exciting. He doesn't know what he's talking about. How much do you want to bet? Enough. Howard, can I please have another iced tea now? I'm so thirsty. What did I just say? What did I just tell you? I'm, like, dying of thirst. I'm gonna defer to Mom on this one. This is so unfair. Get out of here, Joey. If you're just going to stand there hawking about the iced tea, goodbye. Asshole. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. What did you say? I didn't say anything. You better start acting like a gentleman right now. I am acting like a gentleman. Do you hear me? Right now. I'm sorry. Go. Find something else to do. I don't want to see your face. I said I'm sorry. Goodbye. Jesus fucking Christ, Mom. Goodbye. Wow! He is so grown up. You're just gonna let him talk to me that way? You dealt with it. You were dealing with it. You're his father. He needs to hear from you. Stepfather. Oh, oh, what was that? Stepfather. I said I'm his stepfather. What is the significance of telling me that? Mike! Hey, I'm so sorry. Mikey! Where were you? We've been sitting here for 45 minutes. Aw, I got stuck on -- There was a work call I forgot I needed to take. I thought you said you were coming right down? I know. Hey, Mike. How you doing, buddy? It was one of my advisees. I'm sorry. It's a Saturday. No, I know. He wanted to hash out the details of the conference we're putting together with the students for Nader. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Don't tell me you're voting for that asshole. Michael, please don't tell me that. I'm the faculty advisor for the group. You are such a jackass. That is throwing your vote away. Do you want to Bush to win? Thank you! That's what I keep telling him. And Al Gore is not throwing your vote away, corporate lackey Al Gore? I was a McCain guy so... Mm. How are you going to feel when Bush becomes the next president? I am gonna feel like there's no difference between four years of Bush and four years of Gore. What a jackass. Did you bring the plug from the car? The battery's running low. Well, just turn it off. Is that a cellphone? He has a cellphone now. Not gonna turn it off. What if Abby needs us? Well, she's not gonna call tonight. It's late there. Unless there's an emergency. Aw, God forbid. What are you, a heart surgeon? You need a cellphone? It's a family phone. Aw, it's convenient. Oh, I'm dying to get one. You already have a car phone. Yeah, well, this is for when you're not in the car. You don't need that, Howard. Well, it's like Mike said. It's for emergencies. You don't have emergencies. I'm just going to go get the plug. Can you sit with us for five minutes, please? 'Course. So, tell me more about Abby. How's her trip? She's having a good time? She's having a great time. Yeah? Yeah, how's the news coming out of there. Troubling. There's no news. Nothing's happening. It's all fine. The Israelis have the military on high alert. Hamas is in the streets calling for a new intifada. Jerusalem -- they're saying that was the final thing for the Israelis. Everything else they could agree on except Jerusalem. Well, I think there were actually a couple things but... That fucker Arafat. Clinton gave him everything they wanted. They still couldn't say yes. It was a little more complicated than that. Oh, oh, I forgot. He loves the Arabs. Well... what happened at Camp David was not -- It was a lot more complex than what you see on CNN. I'm sure that's true. The Palestini-- The so-called Palestinian state that Clinton and Barak put forward, the Israelis would've continued to maintain full control in terms of militarily, in terms of borders. Okay, the things he says sometimes, if I didn't know him -- honest to god, if I heard him on the street, I'd think he's an anti-Semite. Honest to god. I'm a Jewish Studies professor. Oh, really? When's the last time you were at synagogue? Uh, when was the last time you went? We were at Washington Hebrew for Yom Kippur. You go twice a year, Holly, which is two times more than I go. You're not exactly the rebbe here. I went for Sukkoth last year, thank you very much. I'm an atheist just like you. I'm not an atheist, excuse me. Do you believe in God? That has nothing to do with it. Bombs is what scares me, suicide bombs, because these guys, they'll walk into a café. Everything's fine. Everyone's eating tuna sandwiches, drinking espresso, chitchat, and then all of a sudden, you know, body parts, and it's just awful. Blood everywhere, arms -- They find people's arms or legs! Two hours later, a block away, they'll find a leg. That's what I'm -- I just -- I don't want that sort of thing to start happening again because that is just -- You hear the screaming and the bones and... What the fuck are you talking about? That's what they do. They blow themselves up. Their daughter is there. It's scary as hell! Abby is there right now! I don't think anyone on either side wants dead American kids on the news. Let's maybe not talk about dead American kids right now. That would be nice, wouldn't it? By the way, where is Sharon, speaking of suicide bombers. You're so bad. She had a book sale at school. Hey, congratulations on the book, Mike. That's fantastic. How about a glass of wine? Am I the only one who wants a glass of wine? I'm okay with coffee for right now. Well, that's a huge accomplishment to write a book. Thank you. I always want a glass of wine. Is that bad? So, is this your first book? My third book. The others have been a lot more specialized so... Unreadable. Well, I wouldn't say that. I would. They were not intend-- They were written for academics, so they were not for a general audience. Oh, yeah? What's this one about? I re-- I don't want to have this conversation. What conversation? What'd I do now? I'm not good at the whole two-sentence, like, "This is a book about --" It doesn't have to be two sentences. Who said it had to be two sentences? What is he talking about? It's Jewish history. It's about Jewish history. Well, that was two sentences. Have you read it? He won't let me. I want her to see it when it's finished. You sent the manuscript to your dad six months ago. That was different. You sent it to Dad? He must've been so touched. Well, he never got back to me, so I guess he wasn't that touched. You're kidding. Has he read it? I have no idea. Well, have you asked him? He won't ask him. You haven't asked him? Ask him! I sent it to him. It's his prerogative if he wants to talk about it. I'm not going to force him to talk about it. I don't see why you can't just ask him. Because I shouldn't have to ask him. I'll ask. You want me to ask? I really actually wish that you wouldn't, Holly. Oh, it's crazy. Six months! Michael has some other news, too. Really? I, uh -- I've been recommended for tenure starting in the fall. I thought you already had tenure. No. Well, then great! What? No, it's just sort of a bi-- It's a big deal. It's great. I just said. It's really great. Yeah, most people don't -- It's not an easy thing to accomplish. Yeah, I'll bet. What are you teaching next year, anything I'm interested in? Uh... I'm teaching a grad seminar on ethics in the rabbinic literature. I am teaching the freshman survey course I do every fall on Jews in Europe in the 19th century. I'm already asleep. Thank you. No, I like the class you did on Jews in the movies. That's my kind of thing. Mike, I've been reading... Have you checked out the new Reagan biography yet? Ooh, I haven't. Well, I think you would really -- I mean, the guy is a sensational writer. Really? Well, see, but I'm a big nonfiction guy, so that sort of thing is right up my alley anyway. Do you miss Mom? Do I what? Do you miss Mom? Mikey, I miss here so much. It's like -- It's like a piece of my heart has been ripped out. That's how it feels. Isn't that awful? I mean, I do miss her, Holly. It's kind of a random thing to bring up out of nowhere but... How is that random? You know what? Maybe I will have a glass of wine, just... You sound like Jennifer. Random -- everything I say is random. "That's so random, Mom." That's just a very personal question to throw out there when we're sitting here talking about Ronald Reagan. Okay, what do you think about Dad? Be honest. Wow, you just switch gears, don't you? Do you see how thin he is? Didn't I tell you? He looks so old. He is old. How's Riesling? That's all there is. Anything. I'll have a glass, too, please. None for me. I can't drink it. It's too sweet. Sharon spends all her time with him, you know this? With Dad? Oh, yeah. They go shopping together. They go to the movies. They're like BFFs, as Joey says. Oh, yeah, she's constantly at the house, too. You should see. The way she walks around now -- she picks things out. What does that mean? She says, "I'll take this. I'll take that. This is mine. I want the silver. I want the crystal." Oh, yeah, she's already gone through all Mom's jewelry, you know this, right? Ellen, you should be very concerned about this. We're not getting a thing. Oh, it's your mother, and she didn't like me very much either. Oh, she loved you. She didn't love you, but that's not your fault. Mom loved Ellen. She was very upset when you didn't convert. I offered to convert. Michael said no. Why would you convert to a religion for a spouse who doesn't believe in it? She puts sticky notes on things -- Sharon -- on the bottom of furniture, the backs of paintings, with her name on it. Sticky notes? Yeah. The store, though, that's what she really wants. Oh, she's got her eye on that store. Store? Dad's store? Oh, yeah. She made friends with the family there, the Mexican family that rents it. She takes Dad there to see them every Sunday. Why would she even want it? I thought it was a ghetto dollar store now. Do you have any idea how valuable the real estate there is these days? We're talking mega. It's up-and-coming, that whole area, 14th Street, lots of new stuff coming in -- condos, retail. Howard and I, we actually got in touch with an architect about it. Okay. You cannot breathe a word of this to Sharon. I will kill you if you talk to Sharon about this. I mean it. You're talking to an architect about the store? Did you hear what I just said? I heard you. Yes. We've been discussing renovations. The store hasn't been renovated in, what, like a hundred years? All the systems need updating -- all new plumbing, electric. Who's gonna pay for that? I'm gonna pay for it. Well, we are going to pay for it. Why would you do that? Because it's the perfect place for my business. Howard thinks so, too. There's a lot of potential there. What is your business? What do you mean what is my business? Interior design! You do interior design? Yes, I do interior design. You know that. I mean, I did our whole -- Well, I redid our entire house, top to bottom, and I did Sharon's apartment. That's -- That's not really a business, right? That's more like a hobby. Well, because I don't have an office. The store would be my office. I could actually start something. She's got a terrific eye. Aww! Have you talked to Dad about this? Oh, my God. Sharon's got him so in love with this Mexican family. He's going to keep them there forever paying, like, $200 a month. Meanwhile, we could be making that store so beautiful. Mikey, it makes me ill. Where is Sharon's boyfriend in all of this? Dumped her. Oh, no. Oh. Poor Sharon. Yeah, she left the temple she joined, too -- you know that, right? -- the temple she joined joined after Mom died. The Orthodox one? It wasn't Orthodox. It was conservadox. Right. Yeah, she got -- She was very involved with the temple. Then all of a sudden, she broke up with her boyfriend. That was it with temple. She got Dad going there, too, all the time. I don't like her doing that. Mm. He got a lot out of it. He doesn't even read Hebrew. Yeah, but she was gonna get him into a class there. Abby wants to learn Hebrew when she comes home. Fabulous. Why is that fabulous? I don't understand this. Why is everyone... Why are we excited about this? It's wonderful. It's keeping the tradition alive. Which tradition exactly? Oh, my God. He has to contradict everything. No, it's not her tradition. It's not... Our grandparents, Mom's parents, do you think they spoke Hebrew? They didn't even go to temple. They were educated people. They were enlightened, cosmopolitan people. Now everyone is sudden-- I don't know what happened. What happened? Everybody is religious now? So what? The head of my department -- This is a smart guy. This is not... This is a world-renowned scholar. He grew up like us with the cheeseburgers and the sweet and sour shrimp and the Christmas trees. Oh, I love Christmas trees. Now his whole family -- his whole family is shomer Shabbos! They're walking to synagogue on Saturday morning. Why does that upset you? Because we spent the entire 20th century trying to get away from all that, and now you look around the Upper West Side, everybody is reading books on Cabala and -- and Kosher sex, whatever the hell that is. It's like, "What happened to the last hundred years?" Didn't we already have this conversation? Didn't we decide we were done with, you know, spirits in the sky? I think you could be a little more tolerant of other people's beliefs. I know what he's saying. I understand what you mean, Mike. No, you don't. The pendulum swings in one direction, and then it swings back the other way. The parents are religious, so the kids rebel by giving it up, and then their kids rebel by going back to it. So history is just an endless repetition of the same back-and-forth? The families I work with, I see it every day, the same patterns repeating themselves. So how does anything new happen? How does anything change? Maybe it doesn't. He doesn't believe in tradition. Ellen, you're talking to the wrong person. I do believe in tradition. I just don't believe that religion, organized religion, is necessarily a part of that tradition. Of course you don't. No. A hundred years ago, Jews were part of every single radical secular political movement in Europe. The Zionists, they hated religion. They hated the rabbis more than the communists did. The point was to change this world, to make a world where Jews wouldn't even exist. There would just be one single international human brotherhood. And then at a certain point, we just... We gave up. We gave up on politics and social justice because... I don't know why. Because it was difficult? Because it didn't always work? So now we're running back into the arms of the most irrational, the most superstitious, reactionary forces. We're running as fast as we can back into the Dark Ages, back behind our borders and our fences and our walls -- willingly, by choice, with eyes wide open. So, no, I'm sorry, I don't see that as "keeping the tradition alive!" Abby learning Hebrew? That's not our tradition. That's not my tradition. We sure there's just the Riesling? Oh! This one is my favorite. Read this one. I love this one. "Dear Mommy, I'm sorry I did a bad to you." I love that. "I wish you were not so mad at me now. Love, Mikey." I mean, is that not -- How adorable were you? Did a bad? I don't find this adorable. I find this troubling. Oh, I love it. I should show this to a therapist. This is, like, the smoking gun. A lot of these are like that, apologies. Oh, I remember just constantly apologizing as a child. Mom used to say -- Do you remember? "I can forgive, but I can't forget." Do you remember that? Of course. You can't say things like that to a 5-year-old. Well, you can, actually. You just -- You shouldn't. I'm grateful, though, you know, that she was tough on us. Ugh, these kids I teach, you should see the parents just terrified of their own children, tiptoeing around them. What do you think they're like in New York? Ugh. There are pictures, too. See? Tons of old pictures. Dad behind the cash register. That is probably the only time in his life. I know. I can't believe Mom let him stand there long enough to have his picture taken. Oh, look at the fear in his eyes. She could be sweet, though...Mom. Well, when she was happy with you, there was nothing like that. It was like the clouds parting and choruses of angels. I e-mailed you last week. I don't know if you got it. No, I did. I'm sorry. I've been swamped. I keep calling you. I don't hear back. I've just been really crazy with work and moving into the new place. I just never know. Are you getting the messages, or am I -- Did I call the wrong number? I'm sorry. Well, I was just trying to see if you wanted to visit the store tomorrow, you and Ellen? I thought it might be fun if we all went. You know, I'd love to introduce you to the Jimenez family. Yeah, maybe. I don't know what time we have to head back to the city is the only problem. We've become very close with them, Dad especially. Oh, they love Dad. It's adorable. They think he's, like, a legend. That's sweet. I think they saved his life. Honestly, he was not... I could barely get him to leave the house after Mom died. So finally one day, I decided, "I'm taking him to the store. He hasn't been there in 10 years. He just collects the rent checks in the mail. He should see it. He should meet his tenant." He'd never even met them. Right. He and Rod, they hit it off right away, talking about the Orioles and the neighborhood. Rod? Rodrigo. He's the one that -- It's his store. Well, he runs it with his son, Eduardo. You would love it. Being there, you walk in, and it's just... You can feel it. It's all that history. I thought it was a bargain store now? Well, but I mean so much of it is still there, though -- I mean, the old moldings and the tint ceiling, and in the back, it's like it's frozen in time. There's an old framed picture of Kennedy hanging up. Yeah, I tend not to connect very much with places -- old houses, old buildings. Some places, though, you can feel it, like a spark of something. Yeah, never really found that to be true. Well, I won't beg you, but I think you would love it. I think you would really get a lot out of it. Maybe. Oh. Did Holly tell you about Jonathan? Jonathan? Jonathan. We dated for a year! Oh, yes! Over a year. She did, yes. I was sorry to hear about that. Well, I hope you know that it wasn't your fault. I don't know if Holly told you that it was, but it wasn't. And why would it be my fault? Um, for calling him a Nazi at the funeral. I called him a Nazi? Yes. Michael, you said -- you were talking to him, and he was telling you about his job in marketing, and you went on an -- ugh -- 20 minutes, just on and on about Hitler and the media and complicity -- how he needed to think about complicity. And that's why you broke up? No, I'm saying that's not why we broke up if you thought it was. I would never have thought that. He was very upset by that conversation. It rattled him. To be called a Nazi, it really -- that really got to him. He started questioning everything -- his career, our relationship, his faith. I don't even remember the conversation. He slept with our cantor. That's why we broke up. You're kidding. Please don't tell this to Holly. I know you and Holly, you repeat everything I say. What? Oh, come on, Michael. I know how you -- It's fine. Well, then don't tell me that. I get it. You know what? If you don't trust me, why would you tell me something like that? I do trust you. I just -- I don't want you to tell Holly. I won't tell Holly. She lords things over you. She loves that. So, tell me what happened with... Jonathan. Jonathan. What happened with Jonathan? Ugh. Well, Jonathan and the cantor, they're both obsessed with Bruce Springsteen, so that was... They were always -- After services, they were always finding a table together at the Oneg to talk about "The Boss" and how much they love The Boss, what a great boss The Boss was. And then fast-forward to two months ago, and I walk into my apartment, and there they are on my bed. Jesus. Yeah, oral sex at the same time, 69, just on my bed. That's probably more than I needed to know but... And this is the kicker. Do you know what he said? I really don't. "It's not what it looks like." Do you like that? 69 on my brand-new duvet cover -- $400. Now, I'm going to have to get it dry-cleaned, and it's going to cost me $75, and, "It's not what it looks like"? I mean... Can you even? Was she a good cantor? She wasn't great, frankly. She was very nasal. I told you he was a Nazi. Oh, stop. I did. Stop it. I warned you. Ugh. I should've listened. You can do so much better than that guy, "Shar." I've gotten fat. What are you talking about? Ugh. Pbht! I have. You're like emaciated. Well, thank you but... It's not a compliment but... You look great. I stopped working out. Oh. I can't tell. I got one of those rollers from TV, the Ab Roller. Does it work? I don't know. I haven't opened it. I never come in this room anymore. Whenever I'm at the house, just too many memories, you know? Mom... It reminds me of being 14 and smoking pot out the window. You know, the hospice people, they were going to set it all up in her room. They just assumed, but she wanted to be here, in "Mikey's room." No surprise. Well, listen, if you want help getting rid of some of this stuff... We've already gotten rid of most of it -- all the rental stuff, the hospital bed. You've still got her clothes in the dresser. I'm not throwing out her clothes. I'm not ready to do that. What about the wheelchair? Do you need a wheelchair? Do you need her prescriptions? I'm not ready. I like knowing that it's all here. It feels like it's all just sitting here, waiting for her to come back... like she just went downstairs to make herself a cup of tea. I don't remember Mom ever drinking tea. Well, with the chemo, it's all she could keep down, just peppermint tea and Lorna Doones. You were lucky. You missed a lot of that. I was working. I know. I'm not good in that sort... I didn't want to see her like that. No one wanted to see her like that. We still did, though. Okay. She understood. She really... I mean, you know Mom. Her son could do no wrong. Dad looks good. Doesn't he? Holly thinks he looks thin. She is so full of shit! You know, he's put on 10 pounds since last year. He was like a skeleton when Mom died, and he practically killed himself trying to take care of her. Those last few weeks, he barely left the room. He wouldn't sleep. He wouldn't eat. Probably the only time in their marriage they got along. Oh. Don't say that. It's true. Now, he goes to that McDonald's drive-through in Bethesda all the time. Ugh, I can't get him to stop. He's still driving? His eyesight has gotten terrible. Ugh. He sees double. That's not ideal, Sharon. I would really -- I would love for you to talk to him, Michael. Just whenever I try to talk to him about things like that, he shuts down. Well, if he's not listening to you, why would he listen to me? He respects you. He... Not sure that's true, actually. Oh, come on. I sent him the manuscript of my book six months ago, and he never responded. I know. He told you? What did he say? You know what? You should ask him. It's not my place. What did he say, Sharon? He was hurt. He found it very hurtful. He found it hurtful? It's inflammatory, Michael. A lot of what you've written, it's very inflammatory. He told you it was inflammatory? He told me that, and then when I read it, I agreed. You read it? He gave it to me to see what I thought. Uh-huh. Look. I am your biggest fan. You know that, but I w-- Honestly, if you want me to be honest with you, it... I mean, it's offensive, Michael. You were offended? Yes. How were you offended? Uh, Jews run the government? Where did I say that? Jews run the media. The Holocaust is about making money. Oh. Jews making money off of the Holocaust! That's an incredibly facile reading of an actually quite complicated argument. What did you think was going to happen? You thought Dad was going to -- what, he would really respond to a book like that? You knew that it would upset him. It's a very personal book for me. I thought maybe he would appreciate that. Well, it felt like an attack, like a personal attack. On Dad? On Dad, on our family. How is it an attack on our family? Obviously, you hate where you come from. Ugh. You hate the culture that you come from. That's not true. Well, I gave it to my rabbi. You gave it to your rabbi?! I have a very close relationship with my rabbi. This is the rabbi from the synagogue with the cantor, with the 69'ing cantor? He was as upset about it as I was, okay? He tried to fire her, and then the board -- Ugh. She did a whole song and dance for the board. So, what did your rabbi say about my book? I'm sure he had a wonderfully sage response. Well, he said in the Talmud, they talk -- If you slander your fellow Jew, that's the most... That's an unforgivable crime, Michael. That's one of the worst crimes that there is. Okay. I'm just telling you what he said. That -- Just so you know, Sharon, that was completely inappropriate of you to do that. To do what? That is an unpubli-- That is a manuscript of a book, my book, which I sent to Dad, not to you and certainly not to your asshole rabbi. Okay. That is not fair, Michael. Abby told me about the petition against you. So, obviously, he's not the only one who felt that way. When did you talk to Abby? Abby and I talk almost every day. Since when? She started calling me when she was in the hospital. Abby called you from the hospital? She wanted advice, and I guess she felt like I was the easiest person for her to talk to about the sort of things that she was thinking about. And what was she thinking about? Life, everything -- religion, God, Judaism. So you've been encouraging that? Why wouldn't I encourage it? Because her paren-- You're not her parents, Sharon, and her parents don't approve of those kinds of values. Actually, Ellen has been very supportive. I'm not sure why you're so against it. Because I raised her as a sec-- to be a secular person, a rational person. It has been very healing for her. She was almost... I mean, in November... What did she tell you about the petition? She told me that people read your book... That's not true, actually. ...and they started a petition to get you fired. My book doesn't come out until October. The only people that have read my book are you and Dad. And Rick. Who is Rick? My rabbi. Rabbi Rick? So, you're not worried that there's a petition against you? It's not e... Some disgruntled right-wing undergraduates read a two-page excerpt of the book, which they took completely out of context, and they came up with the idiotic idea for a petition. Well, you can't fire a tenured professor. I've been recommended for tenure. Did you know that? Did you even... Did Abby tell you that? I thought you already had it. Well, I didn't. Well, mazel tov, then. Thank you so much. How many people have signed it? I don't know, not very many. 50? Maybe something like that. More than 50? I should go check on Ellen. Please don't go. Look, I don't want to fight with you. Neither do I. I need to tell you something. Okay. You're just gonna stand there? I guess not. You can't tell Holly. I won't tell Holly. I think I like someone. Okay. Please, don't tell this to Holly. I am not going to tell Holly. I think it... it feels like maybe -- Ugh. I don't know. I just... I feel so -- I'm happy, you know? That's great, Sharon. Yeah. No. It is. Who is it? Well, um, actually, it's Rod. Rodrigo. That's sort of the funny thing about it. Rodrigo? From the store, from the Mexican bargain store? They're not Mexican. They're Guatemalan. Isn't he -- How old is he? 51. It's 12 years. It's not that big a difference. So he's -- What, he's divorced or... They have a terrible marriage. Oh, my -- Sharon. They hate each other. With child-- They have children. Just forget it. Forget I said anything. Sharon. No, if you're just going to stand there and judge me, I wouldn't have told you. I'm not judging you. I'm telling you this is a bad idea. Why did I even -- I knew you would be like this! Like what? Like sensible? Like reasonable? No, like you always are, like you know everything and everybody else is a moron, like I am a moron. This is a family you're getting involved with here, Sharon. I don't care. You don't care? I don't care. What are you fighting about? No one is fighting. We're talking. Howard kicked me out of the kitchen. I have been exiled from the kitchen. Uh-oh. I was accused of micromanaging the table setting. Those are the charges against me. I'm a micromanager. What are these? Old drawings and pictures. Mom had them by her bed. Aww! Oh, my God. Oh, is this the house with the tree in front? That's the store. How do you know? Because I drew it. Really? It looks like the house to me. No. First of all... this is a guy trying on clothes. Is that what that is? I thought that was a baby. Well, I thought that was a little puppy dog with the tail here? What tail? The tail, see? The tail. Boink. That's a suit jacket. Wow. You were a terrible artist. Weren't you? Aww! This is nice, all of us here, the kids at the house! I don't remember the last time this happened, all of us here together. The funeral. Really? It's been that long? Well, that was the last time that Michael was home. Poor Mom. Look. How young she is here. With a cigarette on her lip. Poor Mom. I miss Mom. Do you miss Mom, Sharon? Michael doesn't miss her. I didn't say that. I thought you said you didn't miss her. When did I say that? I don't know. I thought it was weird, too. But... I didn't say it. Well, good. Obviously, I miss her. We all miss her. I know. Maybe she's here today, too, in spirit. That's sweet, Sharon, to think that. Don't you ever feel that way? Like, you're walking up the stairs, and suddenly, you just feel this sort of presence, like someone is right there next to you? A little, maybe. I think a little. I do. That's nice. Do you, Michael? Do you ever feel that? No. She says the food is out of this world. Ah, it's like nowhere else. She had the best falafel. Ah, nowhere else. I wasn't finished. You'll be up all night again. They were in Tel Aviv. They went to this little hole-in-the-wall place. She said, "Mom, you'd have no idea it was even there, this place, no sign." Ah. Those are always the best. Falafel is original-- It's actually -- It's an interesting history in terms of the politics of falafel. Whoa, whoa, whoa. The politics of falafel? Come on. That is not a real thing. It is, actually. The Israelis claim it's an Israeli food. The Palestinians say it's a Palestinian food. Boy, they are just divided on everything over there. Aren't they? Ask Clinton. Yeah, ask Clinton. He'll tell you they can't even agree to disagree. The Arabs, they were never gonna be happy with anything. Absolutely. Well, as long as the Israelis refuse to even discuss the concept of a right of return -- You think if it was up to them, they would give you that right? Why should I have that right? Bite your tongue. Jews have one country. How many countries do they have? They can go anywhere, but we have one. I heard it was Jerusalem. That was the main... No consensus on Jerusalem. Well, there is a consensus, actually. There are eight different UN Security Council resolutions on the subject. Oh, oh, the UN, real Jew lovers. They want to cup up the city, divide it up into parts. It's not a city anymore. It's just pieces. Much like the proposed Palestinian state. Let's maybe talk about something else. Wouldn't that be nice? I didn't bring it up. I think McCain could've done something great over there. What do you think of -- We're not talking about it anymore, Howard. I was saying one -- It's over. Dinner was delicious, Holly. Oh, stop. You outdid yourself, honey. I need the recipe for that green bean casserole. Oh, my God. It's so easy. It's Mom's recipe. Well, mine's a little different. It tastes just like Mom's. Hers was all from a can. I used fresh. Well, it was delicious. It was great. I could probably do a tablecloth trick right now and pull the tablecloth out! Okay, we're not doing that now, Joey. I could probably do it -- I don't care if you can do it. We're not doing it. He loves magic. Oh, good. Okay, I'm not asking you again. Put the Nintendo away and go sit with the rest of your family. Come join us, Joey. Holly, why don't you finish the dishes later? We're all relaxing now. I just got to let these soak. Ugh, she can't stop. Anyone else need more wine? Yeah. I'll have a drop. So, do you feel 75, Lou? 75? Mm. What a fuckin' nightmare. Oh! Dad! Please with the language. Are you expecting a call? Oh, Abby has the number in case there's an emergency. Is that a cellphone? Can I see it? Uh, the battery is running low. Can I still see it? He doesn't need to see it. Why don't you put it away? I'm just worried I won't hear it. Give it to me. I'll hear it. That's what I want for my birthday. Well, you're not getting it. You're not a drug dealer. Sharon was saying maybe we could all go to the store tomorrow. Really? Well, Dad and I were there on Sundays, anyway. Yeah, maybe we can try but -- Oh, I'd love to go. Yeah, we have the train to catch, though. Oh, the Acela? Is it the Acela? Because you can exchange your ticket for a later one, no charge. Ah. I've done it a hundred times. Perfect. Great. Thanks, Howard. Poor Abby. She's gonna be jealous she missed out. Mm. Hey, you guys should come, too. Maybe. I'm busy. I don't think Joey has ever been. I'm busy, though. Yeah? What are you busy with? Extracurriculars. Your uncle and I grew up there, you know? Yeah. I know. Used to go there after school, do our homework in the back. Do you know about the store, Joey? Have you told him about the store? Of course. He knows all about it. Do you know what it was called, Joey? No. Yes, you do. Yes, he does. Haberman's Corner. Oh, right. I knew that. I already knew that. Your grandmother's family, they were the Habermans, and it was your Grandma Mimi, her father, Papa Bill, your great-grandfather. He bought it all the way back in... Wait, When did he buy the store, Dad? Oh, who knows. 1880s. Yeah, could be. So when Grandpa -- When he came back from the war and he married Grandma -- Were you in the Marines? Army. Marines are the best, though. They have swords. Your grandpa liberated Dachau. Oh, cool. That's incredible. That's a big deal, Joey. Well, there were a lot of us. And so when Grandpa -- When he married Grandma Mimi after he came back, he started working in the store with Papa Bill. Yeah. They sold menswear -- suits, ties. They sold clothes to black people. Don't you remember me telling you about this, Joey? We sold to all kinds. We didn't care. Predominantly black people. In 1947, the blacks couldn't even get into a department store in Washington. Incredible. At Haberman's, we had good merchandise. We carried everything they wanted. We were fair-priced, and we didn't care what color they were. It didn't matter to us. A lot of the stores in the black neighborhoods were owned by Jews historically because they were cheaper to own, and there was a captive customer base. This was not a black neighborhood. It was a mixed neighborhood. And the Habermans hated you. Didn't they, Dad? The Habermans were German. Oh! You know, they'd been in Washington for two generations already, yeah. My family, they were Russian, yeah, right off the boat, so, uh, yeah we were... They looked down at us. They were snobbish, but it was okay. It was all right. So, after Papa Bill died, you took over the store? Uh-huh. Well, with Mom. Mom ran the register. She did all the bookkeeping. What happened? What happened? Well, Martin Luther King died, and the blacks had a riot, and they burned down the city. That's what happened. The blacks had a riot? All the black people, apparently, on the entire planet, had a riot. Every street they burned down, all the way up to our street. Wow. But by the time they got to us, I guess they were worn out. Stokely Carmichael must've gone to bed early. By the time they got to you, the National Guard was there. It's like in the Exodus story when God passed over the houses of the Israelites. Is it, though? I think it's very much like that. We were there that night. Do you remember, Michael? I didn't know that. Oh, yeah. We walked there together after school, the two of us. I remember when they announced it on the radio, the assassination, and Mom and Dad, I remember they looked at each other like they knew, like they just knew. And, Dad, you took out all the money from the safe, and they took out all the books from our bags, our schoolbags. He put the books in the safe, the money in our schoolbags. He said, "Sorry about the books. We'll get them later." Do you remember this? Yes. And then you decided -- Oh, Mom was so mad that Dad decided he was gonna stay until things calmed down, so we locked up. Mom put down the grate, and I remember, we looked back inside, and there's Dad just sitting there, listening to the radio. I'll never forget that. He stayed there all night. Mm-hmm. I don't remember where I was. Oh. You were a baby. You were at home with the nanny. Yeah. Why did you sell the store? I didn't sell the store. We leased the store. Your grandfather rents the store to people who pay rent for it, Joey. They pay him rent every month so they can use it. That's how rent works. Why don't you just run the store? Oh, I'm too old to run a store. I don't have the energy. Yeah, it takes a tremendous amount of work to operate a business, Joey. It's very time-consuming. I got tired of all the bullshit. Dad. You know, after the riots, the blacks, they were always mad about something. Okay. Well, the city changed. The whole country changed. Probably for the better, in many cases. In most cases. Yeah, it changed -- more drugs, more guns, homeless people. Well, it's changing again in the neighborhood, all those new restaurants, new apartment buildings. The rents in that part of the District, they have shot up. Yeah, yeah. We don't want to raise the rent. Dad loves the tenants we have now. We're going to have them for Rosh Hashanah this year. They've never been to a Jewish holiday. Ooh! They're in for a treat. You should see Dad with Rodrigo. They have such a good time together. He's -- He's got my sense of humor! Which is what? Funny. Dad and I actually -- Last week, we opened a college savings account for Eduardo's daughter, Sylvia. She's 7. She's adorable, so smart. You're paying for her college now? It's a couple of hundred bucks a year. She's brilliant, this girl. How lovely. I'm gonna to grab another beer. Anyone else for a beer? I need water with ice. Coming right up! So when I go, Joey -- God forbid! Dad! He loves to talk like that. He thinks it's cute. Oh, no. Someday when I go... the store will be yours! Aww! Probably, I'll make it a video-game store. Ah. You're not doing that, Joey. Do you know how much money you can make in a video-game store? Well, you'll have to split it with Abby and your sister. That's fine. Oh, he's so generous. We'll see what the Jimenezes think about that. They have their own plans, I'm sure. It's not their store. Well, I didn't say that it was. My father, when he came to this country, he was your age! Didn't speak a word of English. Didn't go to high school, didn't go to college. Came here with the clothes on his back. That's amazing. Yeah. And he walked through Haberman's Corners. Now here with -- This is a man who spent his entire life living paycheck to paycheck. Everything he did, everything he put aside, was all for that, that he could live long enough that he could see that, that he could see that his son owned something, something that was, you know, brick and mortar, you know, something you could touch, something you could pass on to the next generation, something that was better than what came before. Mm. Wow, Dad. Do you hear what he's saying, Joey? No, Mom. I'm deaf. Nobody here thinks that's funny. I always thought that one of you kids would want the store, but you were always busy. Well, we had careers. Well, so... Speaking of careers, Dad, Michael actually has some big career news, don't you, Michael? Aw, we don't have to do this. Can I tell everyone? Think everyone already knows. Dad, Michael got tenure. Oh! Well... Isn't that great? That's great! Good for Michael. Thank you. We should toast. A toast, yes! And Michael has a new book coming out, too. Let's not talk about the book. Did you know that Michael has a new book? I don't need you to do this. Let's talk about something else. Dad, Michael was very concerned because he sent you the book six months ago and he didn't hear back. What are you doing, Holly? So, Joey, are you excited to start eighth grade? I'm starting 11th grade. Oh, are we talking about the book? Did I miss it? No. We're not. Well, give us the synopsis, Mike. Synop-size it for us. Well, Dad read it. Maybe Dad can tell us about it. He doesn't want to talk about it. Well, I at least want to know the title. Can I hear the title? Uh, it's called "Forgetting the Holocaust." Whoa. So it's, uh -- it's about the Holocaust, sort of a history? It's about Jews, American Jews. And the Holocaust? Uh, the relationship between American Jews, Israeli, and the Holocaust and just how that relationship works. Aha! Great. And how does it work, the relationship? Uh, it works because Israeli and the right-wing allies of Israeli in this country, in the United States, they use the Holocaust, the memory of the Holocaust, to get American Jews to support certain kinds of policy prerogatives in the Middle East. Is it fact or opinion? Because it sounds more like opinion, maybe. Well, I have 60 pages of footnotes. Well, that is impressive. Wow. I mean, why do you think both political parties in this country are in lockstep with whatever Israeli wants? Why is that the one thing they can all agree on? Because of the goodness of our leaders? Because they love Jews so much? They certainly didn't love us while the Holocaust was actually, you know, happening. Maybe because they understand that it's the right thing to do. Uh, or maybe it's because they get campaign contributions from wealthy Jews and wealthy Jewish foundations, and that's what drives American foreign policy. He sounds like Pat Buchanan. Because Jews who used to care about civil rights and social justice, economic justice, they're now -- now their number one iss-- their only issue is "Israel!" This is what your book is about? You know, there's a petition against him. Do you know about the petition? There's a petition? It's like a hundred people. You said 50. You know, I think it was very brave of Michael to write about a subject like this. I think it took a lot of courage. Well, you're not Jewish, Ellen. Sharon! What? Not to be rude, but I don't think you really understand what these issues mean to people. Right, only Jews are allowed to have an opinion about Israeli. Everyone else, "Just shut up and agree." This is about Ellen has never had to be worried about being put in a concentration camp... There it is! ...because she's Swedish. Norwegian, actually, but... There it is. Thank you, Sharon, for demonstrating the entire thesis of my book. The best way to win an argument about Israel -- change the subject back to the Holocaust. If you don't understand the Holocaust, how do you understand Israel? The idea of the Holocaust has been used to distort American Jewish life and discourse and culture since the 1960s... Yeah, here we go. ... until today. Now -- Now, walk into any synagogue in America, the Holocaust is now the centerpiece of Jewish life, right, the linchpin that binds us together. It's no longer -- It's not culture anymore or food or religi-- It's certainly not religion with the number of American Jews that actually practice their religion. It's the "6 million," and we have been manipulated, all of us, our entire lives, to feel constantly victimized, constantly afraid. You hear it all the time. "It could happen again! Never forget, because it could happen again." Well, because it could happen again. It already has happened again! Happened in Bosnia. It happened in Rwanda. It just didn't happen to us. No. We learned all the wrong lessons from the Holocaust. We learned that the world hates Jews, that the world will always hate Jews, instead of what we should've actually learned, which is that nationalism is a sickness, and it is lethal. And the book argues that the only way we can escape what has essentially become, at this point, a religion and a culture of, frankly, death and death worship, a culture that finds its meaning and its reason for being in the charnel houses of Europe, the only way we can get past that is if we forget it actively -- we stop making movies about it and writing books about it and just celebrating it, venerating it like it's -- Because, otherwise, if we don't, I feel -- I argue at length in the book, if we don't forget the Holocaust now, if we don't begin to disentangle ourselves from our own obsessional neurosis, then we'll be... this will be the end of us. This will be our last chapter as a people, if we can even call ourselves that anymore, when the only thing that connects us to one another, that connects us to ourselves, even, are ghosts. I don't believe in ghosts. Do you mind if I join you? Oh. Not at all. Oh. Need a hand? Oh, no. I'm okay. I'm okay. Oh, ho, ho. Oh, the difficult part of sitting down is standing up. You have to choose one or the other and then just stick with it. You mind if we turn that off? Oh, that -- I'm not watching. Sharon and I, we went to the cemetery last week. Did I tell you this before? Good, good. We made a stone for you, for your mother. We told her you said hello, and I wanted you to know that. Well, thank you. It's a nice -- nice plot. Busy, very busy, always busy. And that's what she liked about it, right in the middle of the action. You got tenure. You didn't say anything about it. That's an accomplishment. I didn't know about this, uh, petition. A hundred names is it? Close to that. How close? Um, the last time I checked, it had just passed 9,000 signatures. I was recommended for tenure. The board hasn't... They still have to approve the recommendation. They have to vote. And, uh... I did read your book. I heard. What'd you think? At Dachau... I don't know if you came across this in your research or not. When the Americans liberated the camps at Dachau... you have to remember they didn't know what we know now. They didn't have a word as to what they were going to see, what they were going to walk in on. They thought it was a POW camp. Every door that they opened, in every room, from the floor to the ceiling, they found bodies stacked up, one on top of the other. You can imagine the smell coming from everything, from the gas chambers, from the bricks in the crematorium, from the ovens, from... the dirt under your feet, boots. And the ones we found, the ones that were still alive, it was the worst with them. The smell coming up off their skin, their breath... Oh, Michael. They were so hungry. Whenever the GIs gave them food, they gave them rations, and some of them, they were so hungry, they ate so quickly no one could get them to slow down, and their stomachs ruptured. All those years, and they end up dying of a full stomach. Some of them, they weren't hungry. They didn't want to eat. They went back, and they found the guards, the Germans... ...and they took shovels -- Well -- Well, they found shovels, they found bricks, they found sickles, and they hit them with the shovels and the bricks and the sickles, the Germans who had killed their parents... their brother maybe... or their children right in front of them. They took shovels, men who didn't weight 100 pounds. You could see the bones sticking through their skin. They took their shovels, and they smashed in their faces on and on and over and again. And the Americans, some even, they helped. They rounded them up. They rounded the guards up, and they gave the prisoners their guns... and the prisoners shot them one by one like animals. Like Jews. And the Americans, they just watched. We just... We stood. We watched. And we were glad. My God! We were glad. I'm still glad. For you, history is an abstraction. For us who have survived this century, this long, long century, there are no abstractions anymore. Happy birthday to you Come on, Dad. Come on, Michael. Joey, sing. ...birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Dad Happy birthday to you Does she need to that right now? Hello? Who is that? Honey? Is that Abby? What's going on? I can't hear you. Where is she? I can't hear her. Make a wish. Where is she, Ellen? I can't hear you. Everybody, shh! Shh! Abby, slow down. I can't understand you. What happened? Chaos in the Middle East, where that "day of rage" turned into violent confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians. NBC's Martin Fletcher is on the front lines in Jerusalem. Israeli police today stormed the most sacred shrine in Jerusalem after hours of running battles with Palestinians. They call this their "day of rage," rage at the week's death toll. Palestinians set fire to this police station, trapping police inside, then hurled thousands of rocks from inside the mosque. Police fired back with tear gas and rubber bullets, avoiding live ammunition, trying to keep the death toll down. Palestinians set fire to this police station, trapping police inside, then hurled thousands of rocks from inside the mosque. I'm home! Finally! Oh, my God. There's a terrible accident on Wisconsin. Dad? Mm-hmm? Are you awake? Oh, hi. Mm. You are awake. Hi. This is what the Israelis were fearing. Ugh. That is the worst intersection, at Albemarle, and people go through their like it's -- ugh, they're driving 60 miles an hour. It's absurd. Oh, here. That doesn't look very comfortable. How's that? I just spoke to Rod again. He said they're all pulling for you, down at the store, the whole family. Eduardo wanted to come and bring you flowers. I said, "Ed, what is Dad going to do with flowers? He doesn't need flowers. What he needs is -- Ugh, he needs somebody who could actually... He needs people here helping him. That's what he actually needs." Ed said, "But aren't you helping him?" And I said, "Yes." He said, "Well, what about everybody else?" I said, "Everybody else? Who's that? Oh, you mean my siblings. Oh. "They're busy," I said, "They've got very busy, very important schedules apparently, so..." I'm just still -- I know I sound like a broken record, but I'm still just a little unclear on what Holly has better to do right now. Just because I have to go back to work eventually. I've already used up half my vacation days. I can't just... I have a job, and Holly, meanwhile, she's sitting at home watching "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" Hi, Sharon. Oh! My God. Did I scare you? Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I, uh... I was, uh... I got refills on Dad's meds. Did you save the receipt? I put it on his Mastercard. You just left Dad here? Well, I was gone for 15 minutes! Oh, really? Because I've been here for a half-hour so... He was sleeping when I left, and he has the Life Alert if there's an emergency. I made up the guest room for Michael and Ellen. Oh, thank you. And I vacuumed -- I've been meaning to vacuum all week. Well, now you don't have to. Now I don't. Good point. You scared me half to death. I know. I thought I was going to have a heart attack. Thirsty, Dad? I gave him a glass of water just an hour ago. His lips are chapped, Sharon! Yeah, I've been giving him water all morning. He needs to stay hydrated. Yes, I am aware, hence the water. His lips shouldn't get chapped like this. They weren't chapped when I left. Well, they're chapped now so... Here, Dad. Juice. No, we got to use the left hand, remember? Got to practice. Come on. There you go. There you go. Oop, oop, oop. That's all right. That's okay. It's okay, Dad. It's okay. You want more? Okay, Dad. Okay. Guess who called this morning. Guess who called. Holly? I don't know, Sharon. Rodrigo. He's been calling every day. That's nice. I know. Don't you think? Mm-hmm. He got Sylvie on the phone yesterday. I put it on speaker for Dad. She was so sweet. Mm. It really makes his day, hearing from them -- hearing from anyone. I'm sure. How does he look? what do you think? Good. He looks good. Better, don't you think? Better than last week? Mm-hmm. Good. I think so, too. Much better. It's been a nightmare. How was I supposed to know that? An unending fucking nightmare, and it hasn't even been a week! You told me he couldn't talk, Holly -- that's all anyone told me. It's more than he can't talk. He can't -- He's not even -- He just sits there. Isn't it fun? Does he have any idea what's going on or -- Sometimes yes, sometimes no. He's in and out. He -- He gets confused. He forgets where he is. So cognitively he -- He can't dress himself. He can't, uh, feed himself. He can't go up the stairs by himself. We have him sleeping on a pull-out sofa in the office. He can't use the bathroom by himself. Jesus. Yeah, it's all very good news. So what are we gonna do? What do you mean what are we going to do? I mean, in terms -- Does he need professional care? Professional care? He's getting professional care. He's in occupational therapy. He's in physical therapy. Here, I'm saying -- somebody here, somebody living here. I don't know, maybe. What about Sharon? What about her? Isn't she sort -- She's already living here, right, it seems like? What are you saying, we should hire Sharon to be Dad's nurse? No, I'm saying maybe that's -- if that's something she wants to keep doing for the time being. Would you want to keep doing that? I'm not Sharon. I don't enjoy my own misery in quite the same way she does. Oh, oh. She's already complaining. She's already -- I'm not doing anything, Howard is not doing anything. Okay, because otherwise, I mean, a person who comes here, a live-in person, that's gonna be -- that's -- that's very expensive. Yes, Michael. We know it's gonna be expensive. Thank you. I'm saying I don't think Medicare covers that kind of thing. Well, it didn't cover it for Mom. Right, so exactly. And you weren't there for most of that, I guess. Is that -- Are you guilt-tripping me now about Mom? Do you feel guilty? I don't live here, Holly. It's a trek for me to get here. You live 15 minutes away. 30 to 45 in traffic, actually. Well, you're a much better person than I am. Give me a fucking break, Michael. You show up here a week after the stroke? Yeah, you told me you didn't need me. You and Sharon both told me not to come. Because we know how busy you are. Yes, I am in litigation -- Professional care? What do you think we're doing, giving him aspirins -- If you would have told me to come here sooner, I -- Woulda, coulda, shoulda. Fuck you. Fuck you. No, fuck you -- No, fuck you, Michael, you fucking self-righteous fucking asshole. How was the train? Did you take the train? How was the train? We took the bus. Greyhound? Do you really care? No, I don't. How are you? How am I? I feel like we haven't spoken in months. We spoke yesterday. For 10 minutes. I am great, Holly. I've never been better. Are you being facetious? Yes, I am. How's the job search going? The job search, that's funny. Um, I can't get a job anywhere in North America at this point. I have a publicist, though. I got a publicist. He gets me speaking engagements at left-wing colleges and bookstores, tiny bookstores. That's fancy. It's not really. Better than nothing? It essentially is nothing, so minus 5% for the publicist. And the lawsuit, it's still -- Ongoing. Have you thought about settling? Sure. Yeah, they just need to reinstate me in my position with lost wages, plus damages for defamation, and I want an apology -- public apology from the board, from the president, then, sure, I'll settle for that. That's fine. What do they say? What do they say? They say my work lacks scholarly rigor. That's their term of art, "scholarly rigor," whatever that means -- scholarly rigor, which this is after the faculty committee voted unanimously to recommend me for tenure, glowing reviews from students, fellow academics, but, no, the board has decided that they know better. Only the second time, by the way, in the 150-year history of the university, that the Board of Trustees has refused to approve a tenure recommendation. "What was the first time?" you may be asking yourself. Oh, well, the guy was accused -- This is not a joke. He was accused of fucking a horse. So, uh, in the annals of university history, it is now me and the horse fucker. So they didn't like the book? No, they did not like the book. They, um -- They disliked the book, I would say. Is it selling at least? How is it supposed to sell when the publisher won't market it? I mean, it's, like, you'd think it never even happened. Sharon said that Abby... decided not to go back to school. When we took her in January, she couldn't wait to start classes and see her friends, and then we got a call from the emergency room three weeks later. Before Israel, we didn't... We thought she had an eating disorder. Even when she was in the hospital last year, it was bad, but it was still... We'd seen bad. We didn't think it was some kind of actual... Hearing voices? Talking to herself? Hurting herself? Cutting herself? Well, the cutting, sometimes they do that for attention. No. These were not, um... What happened in Jerusalem... I don't know how much you actually want to hear this all. No, I... I want to hear. The depth of the cuts, the lacerations that she made, these were very... They were not superficial. Oh. They told us it was Jerusalem syndrome, that Abby had a case of Jerusalem syndrome. Howard looked it up on the computer. The hospital there said they see 100, 150 people a year with it. That's a lot. Well, it's especially people with preexisting -- if they already have certain trauma or emotional issues or -- which obviously Abby -- it can trigger -- Just being there in the city, people who aren't even religious, suddenly they start seeing visions and scaring tourists and... But if it was Jerusalem syndrome, she's home now, so why is she still... Why isn't she okay? How's Ellen managing? Ellen is... She's in complete denial. She spent the whole fall going with Abby to temple, every Saturday. She thinks this is all -- She thinks Abby is having a spiritual crisis. She wants her to talk to a rabbi. She wants her to be a rabbi. She doesn't understand that when Abby says she's having visions, when Abby says God is speaking to her, what she really means is she's having a mental breakdown. Not something to be encouraged. She's not Joan of Arc. Although look at Joan of Arc. Imagine if she'd been alive in the age of Wellbutrin and cognitive behavioral therapy. She -- She thinks that God is speaking to her? On occasion. Do you want some drugs maybe? It sounds like you could maybe use some drugs. What do you have? Everything. I'm like a pharmacy. I've got Ativan, uh, Klonopin, Xanax, Valium. I'll have half a Xanax if... Where did you get all those? They're prescriptions. I have anxiety issues. I'm being treated by many doctors. They don't know about each other. Take the whole thing. You'll thank me later. Wow. This is like old times. Me and my big sister getting high and listening to Jim Croce. Yeah. No Jim Croce this time. Well, that's too bad. So, how are you? How are things with you, aside from the anxiety issues? Things are all right. Well, until Dad. Yeah? Joey is... Joey is okay. How's Howard? Working like a maniac. Traveling all the time, doing all these big mergers. Uh-huh. He got a computer for his birthday. Now he's obsessed with it, "the Web." Whenever he's home, he's down in the basement on AOL. He does these family genealogy things, chat rooms. Sounds fun. Yeah, I think he's probably doing porno things is my hunch. I mean, genealogies at 4:00 in the morning does not sound normal to me. Well, but it is Howard so -- Yeah. Hey, I want to show you something. I had these printed up the other week. Take a look. "Holly Fischer, Spaces and Places." And everyone says interior decorator, interior designer. I thought, "Let's do something different. Let's do something fun," right? "Spaces and Places." It's fun, right? Isn't it fun? Yeah, it's very fun. It's so fun, but it's gonna be very upscale, like, very concierge, right? And this architect and I, we've been really getting into the plans, and then especially since Dad got sick, I thought, "Hello? Wake-up call. We can't keep waiting on this." I mean, we're talking about we need somebody living here, taking care of him. Well, guess what? Dad needs someone in that store who is going to be paying real money every month, not the discount. Wait, so you're going to pay rent to Dad? Why not? I'll -- Howard and I will pay the actual price, not the discounted special, and we'll do all the renovations, all the upgrades. What does Sharon say about this? Oh, my God. Sharon is practically -- I mean, she would cut my head off before she lets me take the store away from these people. Mikey, you should see how she is with this little Spanish girl. I mean, I think she finally understands that she's not gonna have children of her own, that that's over and done with, and so this little girl, it could be... It could be, like, her adopted daughter. It's sick. So you haven't brought it up with her? Well, I figured I wanted to make sure you were on my side before I did. I really have to pick a side? I'm sorry. Are you new to this family? Have you never been in this house before? Oh, no. You keep that. That's yours. So, tell me more about your career. I mean, it's official? You're fired, end of story? The university doesn't have an open position for me. That's the party line -- no open position. Because the Anti-Defamation League has nothing better to do than to turn me into their cause of the month. I'm the self-hating Jewish Studies professor/Hitler apologist, who wants to wipe Israel off the map. Wow. I mean, the bottom line is they can't fire you for saying something politically they find noxious, so this is how they do it. This is the game plan. They find some technical loop hole. They use words like scholarly rigor so they don't have to say the truth, which is that academic freedom in this country does not extend past the green line, pass 1967, let alone '48. It's a dark time. Sounds like it. For all of us. I mean, another Bush in the White House? Ugh. A second intifada? Ariel Sharon, the butcher of Sabra and Shatila -- history repeating itself, every terrible thing coming back around again but worse, and where are we in all this, American Jews? We're just rah-rah-rahing along with everyone else, the Bushes and the Cheneys and the Donald Rumsfelds of the world. Alan Greenspan. That's what's left. That's our inheritance. A hundred years ago, we had Albert Einstein. We had Emma Goldman, Hannah Arendt, Walter Benjamin. Now who do we have, William Kristol? Alan Dershowitz? That's what remains of the great Jewish radical intellectual tradition? O.J. Simpson's defense attorney, really? What happened to the red diaper babies, the Jews who sat at the lunch counters and marched in Selma, you know, who burned their draft cards and stormed the Pentagon? We were in the streets. We were shutting down traffic, disobeying police orders, refusing to be silent in the face of empire and death, but we traded all that in for a seat at the table, for Joe Lieberman on the presidential ticket, and look at us now. Now the whole world eats bagels. They watch "Seinfeld" in Topeka. We even have our own country with our own atom bombs and everything! Star of David gunships! We're white people now! We're respectable! We're nothing. We're nothing at all. But, so, I can count on you, though, with the store? Sure. I think I'm starting to feel that Xanax. My tongue is really heavy all of a sudden. Take a nap. Maybe. I'm happy you're here, Mikey. Don't call me Mikey. I hate that. I'm happy you're here...Michael. Me too. He don't even look his age! Yes. He doesn't. My gosh. But this is good. You are a tutor and a mentor in school, an assistant teacher in anger management. Whoa. How's school? It sucks. That's too bad. I'm used to it. We saw your sister's play a few weeks ago, "The Seagull." Mom said Jennifer had the smallest part in the whole show. Well, she didn't say very much, but she was onstage a lot, especially in between scenes, moving things on and off. Is Abby coming today? She's not, but she sends her love. Is she living in a mental hospital? Is she -- Howard says she has to live in a mental hospital. She was in -- It's called an outpatient program. She was never -- She's not in a mental hospital. Howard said Abby went crazy in Israel. Abby had... She was going through a very -- a tough time, but she's doing a lot better. She's feeling really good now. Why isn't she here? She had... She has a busy schedule. At the mental hospital? Again, there's no mental hospital. There's an outpatient program. Ellen. I didn't know you were here. Oh, we just got in. And you're here, too. Hi. How long has he been asleep? About 10 minutes. Do you think he's warm enough? I just turned the heat up. I think he's -- I think it's good. How's Abby? She's -- You know, she's doing okay. I spoke to her this morning. Oh. She said she wanted to come today but Michael wouldn't let her. That's not nice. Well, Michael felt that it was better for her not to make the trip, all the added stress. We should talk later, just privately. Okay. Abby is feeling very -- She's upset with her Dad. She thinks he's being very unsupportive. Yeah, she and I, we've had a lot of conversations about this, and it's -- We resolved the issues. Let's talk later. Great. Look, I want to be as helpful as I can, you know? Thank you. I love my Abby. I was there when she was born. Remember that? I do. I was also there. That's true. Why are you here? Howard dropped me off. What is he doing? He said he had to run errands. What errands? I don't know. Stop screaming. Hi, sweetheart. Aw, you look thin. Aw, no. Is he warm enough? I just turned up the thermostat. I'm freezing. Are you cold, Ellen? No, I'm okay. I don't want him to get overheated. It's like an igloo in this house. Where is Michael? I left him upstairs. He's taking a nap. I thought we were all going to talk as soon as he got here. Well, he's tired. I gave him a Xanax. Okay. You know, I'm here, too, Sharon. I can talk. Why don't, uh... Why don't we talk? Yeah. Let's talk. Do you want me to... I don't think we need you right now, Ellen. Is that okay? Oh, no, no, of course. Thank you, sweetheart. You're so sweet. Isn't she sweet? Oh, the sweetest. Should I get Michael? Not if he's napping. I bet he's tired from the long bus ride. It's very tiring sitting on a bus, reading a book. I'll see if he's up. She left Abby at home alone with a nurse. They hired some nurse. I thought Abby was in a mental hospital. It's an outpatient program. She begged them to come today, begged to see Dad. That's sweet. Michael refused. Of course, Ellen just rolls over. Well, it sounds like things are very...delicate with Abby right now. What, Is that what Michael told you? I don't want to have this conversation in front of Joey. I'm not listening. Go into the other room. You go in the other room. Excuse me? And pull up your pants! You look like a thug. I am a thug. He doesn't even know what that means. Yes, I do. I'm not retarded. What did I tell you about using that word? I know! I know! Well, then don't do it! Come on. That's smart not letting him say retarded. Why is that smart? Well, because it... It lets him know that it's not a bad thing. Joey is not retarded. I know that. Well, then why is that smart? You know what, Holly? If you're just going to pounce at everything I say -- Come on, we're going to talk about Dad. Let's talk about Dad. Look, I'm exhausted. Well, you're doing too much, Sharon. You're running yourself ragged. I can't just take off work forever. I have 23 kids that need me. Of course. I just -- Ugh. I can't keep doing everything myself. I've been here every day, Sharon. That's not true, but okay. You're right -- Thursday, I had a doctor's appointment. For the entire day. What is gonna make you happy here? We're going to need somebody here with him 24 hours a day. Right, well, I think we all agree on that. The sooner, the better. Well, Howard looked through Dad's long-term-care policy. First of all, it takes three months for it to even kick in. We can't wait for three months. And then once it does, Howard says it's crap. So, where does that leave us? Well, obviously... there's the store. The store? Well, in just in terms of when you look at the money that's coming in, Sharon, the rent that's being paid right now is very, very low. That's what Dad wants. Is that what Dad wants or what you want? It's what we both want. So you're saying you won't even consider the income that Dad is getting from the store, which is his primary -- his only source of income? I won't. Well, I don't really know what the other option is, Sharon, I hate to tell you. The other option is Howard, obviously. He makes more money than all of us combined. We can help out. You can help out? I'm not asking Howard to put in all of the money when you won't even have a conversation about the store. That's not fair! Fair is we each give what we can afford. I can afford to spend time helping Dad, and you and Howard can afford to pay for his care. We would be paying for his care so you wouldn't have to spend time helping Dad. I would still help Dad. Then why would we pay for his care? You know what? Forget it. Oh, oh, oh. Are you gonna have a hissy now? Is that what's happening? "Let's just let Sharon do everything." It'll be just like Mom all over again. Excuse me? "Because, Sharon, what does she have better to do? Because a kindergarten teacher has no life. She can stay with Mom, change her catheter -- I'm leaving! Look, where are you going? I'll pick up dinner. I already got groceries. Well, I'll get more. Ugh. That's a waste! I know! Look, Holly. Ugh! Where did Mom go? Aunt Sharon, where did -- She left! Okay? She's gone. Okay. What happened? Mom left. Where did she go? I don't know. How's it going? Fine. Yeah, how is school? It sucks. That's great. He's asleep. I can see that. Where'd Holly go? I hear you're taking drugs. What? Holly gave you drugs, right? You're high. I took one Xanax. I'm not high. We're not here to have fun with drugs, Michael. Fun with drugs? We need to figure this out. I'm here to figure it out. What is your problem? My problem? I don't have a problem. I'm not the one who can't spend two minutes in this house without getting stoned. You know what? If you're going to be combative and rude at everything I say -- No! I'm not. I'm sorry. I'm in a shitty mood. I'm sorry. I have the worst headache. Have you eaten anything? I'm so nauseous right now. Are you sick? Holly put me in a shitty mood. Well, you don't have to take it out on me. I know. You're right. I'm sorry. You're right. Thank you for coming. Thank you for being here. I know it wasn't easy for you. Well, I wanted to be here sooner. Well, still, you did your best. You did tell me you didn't need me. It's been a hard couple of months, I know, with Abby and this whole lawsuit business. Yep. I guess maybe I was right, though, about the book. What? Well, I told you people would be upset. I don't care if people are upset. Well, then good. They should be upset. It's upsetting. It is upsetting to tell people to forget the Holocaust. I didn't -- That was not meant to be taken literally, obvious-- That was a provocation, an intellectual provocation. So you don't want people to forget the Holocaust? I do want... I want people to remember in a different way. Why didn't you say that, then? That is what I said. No, you said "forget." As a provocation. Well, I didn't get that. Okay. It seems like I think most people didn't get that. It does seem like that, doesn't it? Ugh. Just what a shitty year it's been. Ohh. All this shit -- Abby, Dad. And then the Supreme Court... ...the coronation of George W. Bush. I thought that was going to kill me on top of everything else. I started watching CNN till 2:00, 3:00 in the morning, just yelling at the screen. So if I can't yell at the Board of Trustees, I can at least yell at fucking Wolf Blitzer. Oh, my God. You voted for him, didn't you? What? Who? You voted for Bush, didn't you? It's none of your business what happens inside the ballot box. That is private. Only Republicans say that. I'm an Independent. Cannot believe that my own sister voted for George Bush. Just because you disagree with my opinions doesn't mean that you're right and I'm wrong. Eh, except in this case, actually, I think it does mean that. You didn't vote for Gore either. Well, I didn't think he was gonna lose. I know this may not matter to you, but Bush happens to be much better for Israel. Better in what sense of the word? Mm. In the sense that he's not going to force them to give up Jerusalem like Clinton was trying to do. The Israelis would've kept all of West Jerusalem, two-thirds of East Jerusalem. You know, a lot of Democrats, a lot of liberals, people like you, have become, frankly, very anti-Semitic, especially about Israel, and a lot of Jews are realizing that the Republicans, they actually like Jews. They want them in their party. Until they don't. Well, anyway, like I was saying, it's very kind of you to take time out of your busy schedule to be here a week after we needed you. You told me you didn't need me, Sharon. Well, I'm so appreciative that you could be here with us today to help poison the atmosphere. You've already turned Holly into a nightmare. Hello? Anyone home? Ah, fabulous. Another big help. I'm here to be helpful, Sharon. That's why I'm here. Uh-huh. Oh, hey, Mike. How you doing, buddy? Hey, Howard. Uh, where's Holly? She stormed out of the house. Ai, yi, yi. Is everything... Everything's great. Hi, Sharon. How are you, sweetheart? I feel like I'm gonna vomit, Howard. How are you? I'm pretty good. Can't complain. Weather could be better. So happy to hear that. I'm going to sort Dad's pills for the week. We're not going to talk? How can we talk when Holly isn't here? Well, can I help you? No, thank you. Well, don't say I didn't offer. Yeah, I definitely will not say that! Is she... Insane? Your words, not mine. Is there anything to drink in this house? Well, there might be some Kahlúa left over from Holly's birthday. I only see vodka. Yeah, well, that's it then probably, sorry to say. First time I ever got drunk was vodka. Holly and I stole a bottle from my parents. We must've been... I was probably 12. She must've been, I guess, 15, 16. We split it one night when they went out to dinner. I threw up three times. Holly held her own. Sounds like Holly. Sharon was 9. She caught us and ratted to Mom and Dad, naturally. Yeah. I don't think it warrants actual glasses. Hey. I'm all right, I think. You sure? It's -- It's terrible. My parents -- It's funny they never drank. Holidays occasionally. I figured it was a Jewish thing. Nah. My family was split right down the middle. The Russians, they'd barely finished a glass of Manischewitz at Passover, but the Germans, they were -- they were all drunks. That's fascinating. You're gonna regret that later. Ugh. I'm sure I will. Yeah, why don't you slow down, Mike? You're gonna get drunk like that. That's the idea. Well, it's pretty early, don't you think? Well, I need to get drunk enough to beg you for money so... Ah. Yeah. Yeah, you, uh... you need -- you need money, Mike? I'm about 100 grand in the hole right now, approximately, not to mention two months late on the mortgage, so, yes, I do. I do need money. I was just thinking that maybe you could float me a loan, and I'd pay you back, obviously. It's just right now, with the apartment and legal fees and Abby, the treatment program, Abby's school, which we're still paying for... Have you thought about declaring bankruptcy? Yeah, I have thought about that. And? And I thought I could borrow money from you so I wouldn't have to do that... was my thought on that. Hmm. I mean, it would just be temporary. I mean, as soon as I win the case, I'm gonna have -- We're seeking major, major damages. Well, but if you lose the case, Mike -- No, no. No, it's a fundamental First Amendment issue, so either they -- either we win in court or they settle, and the settlement is... It's got to be high six figures for us to even entertain it. It's just right now, um, my lawyers are just -- they're delaying any more work on it until... until they get paid so... Oh, boy. Yeah, boy, oh, boy. I mean, the thing is -- God, it's just cash is pretty tight for me right now, Mike. Uh-huh? Yeah, we're not doing so great ourselves at the moment. Really? Slow year for you? It was, actually. That's not what Holly thinks. Well, Holly doesn't know. Well, Bush is going to give you the tax cuts, though. That'll be nice, right? Maybe that'll bump you back up a little. Hey, I voted for Gore. Good for you, Howard. I just couldn't wait for that damn election to be over, and then Florida -- I couldn't believe everything that went down with the chads, and, yeah, "What was that, a hanging chad or a regular chad?" Or -- Could you believe that? Can I... Ohh! God, that's really... Ew. You don't have to... Uh, I, uh... I made some bad decisions, Mike. I made some pretty, uh -- Oh, these past couple of months. What kind of decisions? Holly doesn't even... All right, look, this has to be between you and me, man to man. You have to promise me that, Mike. What kind of decisions, Howard? Oh, come on, you have to promise me, please. Jesus. Promise. I promise, yes. Okay, because I just -- I promise. Calm down. Well, I'm -- I'm trying, yeah. We got a -- We got a computer. Right, Holly said that you do genealogies. Yeah. I mean no. I don't. I-I got involved with some -- I don't know -- just chat rooms. These chat rooms -- Nothing actually -- Just some, you know, stupid sex talk bullshit. Nothing big. Stupid. I think that's pretty common. Yeah. No, well -- Well, I think yeah, but then it started -- I don't know. I just -- I kind of got into, Mike. I got really just... The whole experience? You know, nobody knows you are, what your history is. You can be fat or thin or black or white or you can be a guy who's a girl or a girl who's a guy or... Am I freaking you out? N-Not yet. I, uh -- I gave someone my credit card. I don't know why I even... Well, we talked for hours online -- I mean hours and hours, and we met a couple of times. She was -- Well, she had a hard life. She was from one of those -- um, Estonia or Lithuania. I mean, she wasn't a -- a call girl, but she was... Well, she got involved in some things that she wanted to get out of. You know, they lock you into these things, and you can't get out. So I said -- I was so stupid, Mike. I was so freakin' stupid. I told her -- I gave her my card. I said, "Do what you have to do, then get it back to me," and she did. She charged, you know, a couple thousand bucks on the card and said, "Yep, all done. Thank you so much." And then she sort of disappeared. But then a week later, the phone rings, and it's Mastercard, and, I mean, it was, uh, tens of thousands of dollars, Mike. And I can't dispute the charges because I gave her the card, so I canceled it. Problem solved. But then I got another call from Visa and another call from Discover. She used my information. She used my name and information, and she took out -- she had 12 credit lines all maxed out, cash advances. We're talking hundreds, okay? Hundreds of thousands just gone like that, vanished, and it's not like -- We didn't have a whole lot of savings to begin with. Everything I make, it goes right out the door. And what am I supposed to do now if I tell them what happened? They'll have to open an investigation, and if they open an investigation, Holly finds out. And if Holly finds out, I am fucked. Look, it wasn't even sexual between us, is the thing... well, at least after the first couple of times. I just... I liked her. I thought she was nice. So, what do you think? What do I think? Well, about the situation -- What do you think I think, Howard? Uh, I don't know. It's my sister. Well, it's my wife. How am I supposed to respond to this? Uh, like a friend maybe. Well, I'm not your friend, Howard -- I'm your brother-in-law. Oh. Well, okay. Well, then never mind. Never mind? I can't never mind -- How am I supposed to never-mind? Well, if you would've told me about something like this, I would've never-minded. Well, I didn't have sex with a prostitute from the Internet and give her my credit card, Howard. That was you. You did that. I did. You're right. I did. So, what are you gonna do? I don't know. You don't know? I don't know. That's not good. Well, I had one idea, maybe. What is it? Oh, this has to come from you. It can't come from me, otherwise Holly will just... What's the idea, Howard? The store. Is this about Holly's interior-decorating business, the Spaces and Spaces? Because I don't think that's gonna be a real cash cow, Howard. No. I'm not talking about Holly's business, Michael. So what are you talking... Hello. So... I think we need to have some sense of overall cost before we start even talking about who's doing what. This is not about money. It's a lot about money. I disagree. It has something to do with money. I think actually it has more to do with care. Right now we need to know what each of us -- what we're gonna be expected to contribute here in terms of -- fine, care. Let's call it care. Well, with Mom, for instance, what ended up happening was I did everything from the beginning. That is just not true, Sharon. I moved into the house the day she was diagnosed, and I left a month after the funeral -- two years of my life. I was here as often as I could be. Which was not a lot to just be -- if we're being honest about it. I had two children to raise. It doesn't matter who was here more. You weren't here at all so -- I really don't want to dredge this up. Yeah, I bet you don't. Can we get back to Dad since that's why we're here, please? If I could just... Look, with families that are -- When there are health issues that affect everyone, a good question to start with is really what kind of care do you think he's going to need. He's going to need someone here, someone at the house. Okay, great. That's helpful to guide the conversation. And how much does that cost? $1,000 a week. Wow. A week? At least. Ellen and I don't have that kind of money. Do you think I do? Well, I'm sure we can help. Howard, looked through Dad's savings. There's not a huge amount of savings. He spent all of it for Mom. Insurance wouldn't cover any of it, the prescriptions, the nurses. Howard and I can obviously -- I mean, we have the most, so we can pay for a lot of the care. That's fine with us. Good. Well, not necessarily with Joey, with his needs. We don't have unlimited resources. No one is saying unlimited. We're saying you're rich. You're a lawyer. Well, Joey is very expensive. Okay, that is not a nice thing to say. Well, I didn't mean it like that. He's our son. Come on, I'm saying with his school. Look, a lot of our money is tied up. There's Joey's tuition, Jennifer's tuition, Jennifer's apartment, Jennifer's allowance. Which we've already cut back on. Well, if it's not already with the kids, it's tied up in investments. We don't have a tremendous amount of cash lying around for the taking. I wonder if maybe the best solution -- There might actually be a best-case scenario here that we haven't even thought about. Which is what? Um, well, the store. Yes! What about it? Um, properties in that area have re-- 14th Street -- Everything there is hot right now, Sharon. I'm not raising the rent on the Jimenez family. I'm not talking about raising the rent. If other property owners are doing that, pricing people out, that's despicable. To me, that's horrible. I agree. I'm not saying raise the rent. I think Michael is saying that maybe it's time to consider new tenants, tenants who could afford to pay the market price for rent. That's not exactly what I said. The Jimenez family is wonderful, but the store is a business. Sharon, we have to think about it like a business. Yes, I'm aware that it's a business, Holly. Thank you. I need an office. I've been looking for the past two years. Howard can tell you. I mean, I've -- I've looked everywhere, and the -- the store it's -- well, it's perfect. It's the perfect location. An office? Mm-hmm. For what? My business. What business? Well, it's called... Spaces and Places. What is she talking about? Let's maybe take a second -- It's a boutique interior-design firm. Well, I'm lost. W-With the rent that we pay Dad, we'll end up paying for his care. That's the point. Okay, Sharon? You want to kick out the Jimenez family so that you can have an office for a business that doesn't exist? It does exist. Do you want to see my business cards? Ca-- Can you support me here, someone, please? So this is your idea, too? Yes, it is. You want to put the Jimenez family on the street after all they've done for Dad? Can I say something? What have they done for Dad? Everything. Like what? Before we get too far ahead of ourselves -- Like lift his spirits. Oh, oh, by calling him on the phone once a week? No, by caring, Holly! By actually caring! I think Mike is trying to say something. I'm saying sell the store. We sell the store. What? Before you both have your knee-jerk reactions -- Absolutely not. Can you just listen? You want to sell the store? We are not doing that. It's not even the store anymore. It hasn't been the store in 30 years. It's a Mexican bodega. Guatemalan, and it is not a bodega. Are you going to participate in this conversation, Howard, or are you just -- are you suddenly a deaf-mute? I'm listening to Mike. I want to hear what Mike has to say. This would guarantee that we have enough money for Dad, and whatever is left over we can, you know... We can divide the rest between us. So this is an investment thing for you? This is a money-making thing. It's our inheritance. We're going to inherit it anyway. What is the difference? The difference, Michael, is that he's still alive. Yes, and, this way, he could see us enjoy the money instead of -- You want him to sell the store to some huge real-estate company who's going to knock it down and turn it into some kind of what, condos for yuppies? It's horrible! It's a neighborhood there. It is a neighborhood. It's not gonna be a neighborhood for much longer. Oh, so you're comfortable, Mr. Ralph Nader? You're comfortable completely transforming the face of this neighborhood? It's happening already, whether we want it to or not. No, you're comfortable kicking Hispanic people out of their own neighborhood. It used to be a Jewish neighborhood. Then it was a black neighborhood. Now it's Hispanic. Soon, it'll be something else. Wow. I'm not comfortable with any of this. Thank you. That is your family's heritage in that store. It's Abby's heritage in that store. It's a building, Ellen. It's four walls and a ceiling. Our grandparents built those walls. I don't actually think -- They built the ceiling. I'm sorry to burst your bubble on this. I think the building was already there. Abby would be heartbroken to lose that history. How do you think that Jennifer would feel or Joey? They don't care. That is absolutely not true. We could sell it for $3 to $4 million, okay? That's the figure we're talking about here -- just so we're all on the same page, okay? $3 to $4 million. You're kidding? Conservatively. So what? So what? I don't care if it's $20 million. Well, that's a lot of money, Holly -- $3 million. We already have a lot of money, Howard. Nobody needs that kind of money. Uh, we do. We're broke, Ellen. We are not broke. No, we understand, Michael. Money comes first. Spoken like a true socialist. Howard and I can give you money, Michael. If you need money -- Oh, really? We don't need money. Michael is exaggerating. He's being very dramatic. He's putting on a little show for us. In what way am I exaggerating? We have my salary. You're completely discounting my salary. Your salary? Are you kidding? Am I kidding? I'm sorry, but there is already a compromise here which everyone is ignoring, and that is Spaces and Places! Aw, my God! Howard and I are offering to take care of Dad, all of his expenses. Is that true, Howard? But you need something in return. You need your little -- your project. Is this what you want to do, Howard? Howard and I are going to renovate the store. We're going to take care of all the upgrades for free. Well, we should discuss the details first. Who's going to pay for that? He's not going to pay for that. Of course, he is. Let's just -- Can we discuss for one second? See. Okay, do you believe in this or not, Howard? I-I believe in it. I just -- I think what Mike is saying, it makes a lot of sense to me. Oh, it does, does it? Well, $3 million. So nobody here is on my side. No, of course, I'm on your side, Holly. Nobody is supporting me. I'm just trying to think about it practically. No, you know what? I give up. No, Holly. I give up. We'll give her the money. Okay, Sharon? Howard and I, we're gonna give you the money. You happy? You can keep the store. No, I'm not sure that's the best plan, Holly. I just want Dad to be happy. That's all I want, and if that's our money, that's our money. I'm not arguing anymore. This is insane. Thank you, Holly, for saying the one sensible thing that anyone has said. Except you can't give Dad the money. It's tied up, like Howard said. That's the problem. So get it un-tied up. I don't understand that. Well, it's a lot more complicated than ju-- I mean, there are fees and taxes, and just I would really rather not do that. Oh, I would really rather not sell my family history, Howard. Choices, choices. So we'll pay for now, and then we can readdress in a year. I don't care. A year? We can't do that. No, I can't guarantee I have the cash for that. He doesn't have the cash. Why not? He just said that. That doesn't make a lot of sense to me. A lot of it is tied up in the stock market and other investments. He doesn't have the money, Holly! But what does that mean? It's gone! Okay? It's gone. That's what it means. Okay, well, it's not -- Stop, How-- Just stop. We don't have time for this. I'm sorry. It's gone. What is he talking about? What is he talking about, Howard? It's complicated. What, you lost money? What did you do? Look, it's gonna be fine. Maybe you can have this conversation -- No, what did you do, Howard? I just -- I met someone who needed help. You met someone? Holly. Oh, my God. How much money did you give this...person? No, we have money. Then where is it? Yeah, a lot of it is just tied up. Okay, if you say "tied up" one more time, I'm gonna tie you up by your fucking balls, Howard! Where's our money? I don't know what you want me to say. You bastard. What do you want me to say? I want you to get the fuck out of this house. That's what I want, Howard. Holly... Get the fuck out. Look... I'm not giving up my family, our history, because of whatever kind of creepy thing that Howard did. Don't, Sharon. I'm not doing it. What is the alternative? I guess we all just have to pitch in. Well, we can do that. How can we do that? We can help, Michael, obviously. We can help as much as we can afford to help. Thank you, Ellen. We have a mortgage. So? We'll take out another loan. This is family. Can't take out another loan. Who is going to give us another loan? We'll figure something out. We always do. And what about the $2,000 a week for Abby's treatment program? That is a temporary expense. She's done in two months. And then what? And then she's going back to school in the fall. We've already set that money aside. And how long until we get a call from the hospital? How long until the phone rings at 2:00 in the morning because she hasn't eaten in a week? She is doing better. 100%. She's working very hard. She's always doing better, Ellen! She was doing better before Israel. She was doing better after Israel. Well, I happen to have faith in our daughter. I do, too. And I see the reality. And what is the reality? The realit-- The reality is our child is sick. She's sick, and she's not... she's not getting better. She's not gonna get better, Ellen. We are going to be taking care of Abby for the rest of our lives. Excuse me. Ellen, you... Can we... Let's maybe start from the premise that we have no other options here, okay? Because guess what? We have no other options here. Why don't we sell the house, too? Tell us the alternative. Yeah, why don't we sell the drapes? Fire sale. Let's get rid of it all. Let's make a killing. Maybe we could all retire early. What's your better idea, Sharon? We're all waiting to hear it. Dad won't let you do this. You realize that, right? He's not going to let you sell his store. He's not in a state of mind to make that kind of decision. According to who? According to the fact that it's completely obvious. Look at him! He has no idea what's going on. That is not true. Well, then we'll hire a lawyer to prove that it's true. Oh, my God. We are not punishing Dad because you decided to buy an apartment six months before you published "Mein Kampf." Okay. Yeah, maybe if you hadn't felt the need to write a book telling the whole world how much you hate yourself, a book that -- by the way, a book that broke your father's heart. Okay? You think it's a coincidence how sick he is? Aw, you're trying to get me... You think that's just happenstance? Trying to push my buttons, Sharon. I'm not gonna let you, not today. You dragged your family through the dirt. Oh, okay. You dragged us 6 million through dirt for your own ambition... Right. Okay. Right. ...so that all the co-eds on campus in their "Free Palestine" T-shirts could think, "Ooh, what a cool guy he is. He's willing to slander 6 million dead Jews. What a hero." Right. Yeah, let's be honest with ourselves, Michael. Let's be honest. You don't believe in anything except yourself. You're a hypocrite, and you're a liar. And the fact that your mother begged for you on her deathbed and you were too busy with your career to be with her is indicative of a whole lot else wrong with you. I was here as soon as I could be. Which is just too fucking late, wasn't it? Fuck you, Sharon. Both of you. You made the bed, Holly. You want an award for that? You want a trophy? You vacuumed! I think we should vote. You are not selling my store! Your store? I'm the only one who cares about it, who appreciates it. You can pretend to be on your high horse about this, Sharon, with your principles and your bullshit. You and I both know the only reason you care about any of this is 'cause you're fucking the Guatemalan guy, okay? So save the sanctimony. What? She's, uh, sleeping with, uh, Rodrigo. You didn't know this? Thanks for sharing that, which you swore not to do. Oh, you're welcome. Is that true? Married man. They're separated now. Oh, good for you. Great job. Well-done. I'm pregnant. You split up a marriage, so you give yourself a pat on the back. What did you say? Your family-values friends in the Republican Party are very impressed. We're having a baby. You're having a baby, Sharon? Sharon? I don't believe that. Ugh, do you want to look at the fucking sonogram? I'm happy. For the first time in my life, I'm finally... I'm happy. Look... if we don't have this money, I don't know what else we're going to do. Do we want to put Dad away somewhere? Is that what we want? We want to put him in a facility, like, a government facility? And now there's a baby? Who's gonna take care of the baby, Sharon? How are you gonna afford that? With sales from the bargain store, with your teaching salary? How much does that add up to? It's history. I get it. I do. We all want to save history and hold on to our history. I would love to keep the store and pass it on to our children and our grandchildren, but at what cost? It's a store. It's a parcel of property. It's not some kind of magical place. There are no magical places. There's just dirt. It's all the same, dirt. This is our family, the family that is sitting here at this table. The people who came before us, they're not here anymore. There's just us. And Dad is part of this family, and we -- we owe him this. We owe him. Come on. I'm sorry, Sharon. No! Jesus! Dad! Oh, Jesus. Dad! No! Let's go sit down. Dad -- Nooooo! Okay, Dad. Whoa, whoa. No! Okay, shh! No! No! Okay. No! No! Dad -- No! Shh! No! No. It's all right. Okay. You're leaving? Oh. Hi. Uh, we are leaving, yes. I didn't really get to see you at all. Next time, I guess. When's that going to be? Oh, I don't know. Maybe Passover. Maybe. Why was everybody yelling? Uh, there was a disagreement. About the store? What happened? Uh, we're selling it. We're gonna sell it. To who? I don't know. When? As soon as possible, I guess. I don't, uh... I thought we were going to inherit the store, me and Jennifer and Abby? Yeah, it didn't work out like that. Oh. What are we going to inherit then? I don't really know. I used to sit up here sometimes with Grandma when she was sick. It looked like the bed kept getting bigger and she was just this blue nightgown that got smaller and smaller. I don't remember that. I didn't, uh... I wasn't here. Jews don't believe in Heaven. Is that -- Are you asking me that or... Mom says they don't. Well, it's a little more nuanced than that but... Mom says the only way people live after they die is if we remember them... except what happens when all the people who remember them are dead, too? What happens when the last person who remembers can't remember anymore? That's a hard -- That's a tough question. Is Abby sick now forever? Abby's... struggling. Can I help her? I would like to help her if I could. She's my cousin, my only cousin. I will let you know if I think of anything. I would like to make sure that she's okay. That's very nice. She's my family. Well, I should probably -- What happened to her in Israel? No one will tell me. Yeah, it's sort of complicated, Joey. I don't mind. I like complicated stuff. Please? Well, she was in Jerusalem. In Israel? Um, sort of. That depends on how you pick the, um... Yes, she was in Israel, and she was with her group, and then, at a certain point... we don't really know when, but she broke off from her group and went on her own. Why? Well, that's -- We really -- We don't know that either. That's when everything gets a little hazy because she doesn't really remember everything that happened after that, just bits and pieces, but she remembers that she climbed somewhere up high, and she was looking down at the city, and she called us then. I don't know where she was at this point or how she got to a pay phone, but she called us, and she said the city had opened up to her. It had opened up, she said, so she could see the inside of it, of the earth, all the built-up rock, all the time, the centuries. Ellen didn't... She told her to slow down, but Abby couldn't stop. She just kept going. She said, "I saw where Jesus entered on a donkey past the gates of the old city." "I saw where Jesus Christ entered on a donkey through the gates of the ancient city." "I saw where Muhammad came from Mecca." "I saw where the Prophet traveled through the night from Mecca on a dream." "I saw where David laid the foundation for the temple." "I saw the walls and the altar and the sashes of the priests, and I smelled the incense of the burnt offerings." "I heard the widows..." "I heard the wailing, the gnashing of teeth of the widows and orphans and strangers." "I saw the Greeks, the Romans, the Persians..." "I saw the famed warriors of Babylon and the terrible legions of Caesar and Suleiman." "Righteous servants all of the one God and the one faith." "Brandishing cold steel to the throats of the infidels." "I saw the crusaders..." "I saw the crusaders sweaty and reverent..." "...in their armor." "...burning the bodies of unbelievers in great pyres under the stars." "I saw men in many uniforms speaking many tongues..." "And I saw them all pass away..." "One by one..." "...by one..." "...by one." "Back into the sand from whence they came." "I saw kingdoms rise and crumble in a moment..." "In a breath." "I saw visages of emperors, hard faces stamped on coins of gold and silver, their names long forgotten, lost to time..." "Vanished back into the sand..." "Everything back into the sand." "Gradually, everything, all of us, everything in time, swallowed back into the sand." Support for "Theater Close-Up" is provided by...
