A WILL TREMPER PRODUCTION IN COLLABORATION WITH STUN- FILM AND CO. AND MICHAEL K. SCHWABACHER ESCAPE TO BERLIN OVER THE NEXT 100 MINUTES, WHILE THIS FILM IS BEING SHOWN, 50 MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN WILL HAVE FLED THEIR HOMELAND IN EAST GERMANY. SINCE 1949, 2.5 MILLION GERMANS HAVE LEFT THE SOVIET OCCUPATION ZONE. THOSE ARE THE FACTS. JUST AS THE EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS FILM ARE BASED IN FACT. ESCAPE TO BERLIN Activists and brigades, onwards, we're building a new world. No big shots can harm us, because our freedom sustains the world. Draw your weapons, workers, farmers, against fascists and war agitators. Beat Adenauer's cliques, lead the global revolution to victory. So! Activists and brigades, onwards, we're building a new world. Dessau. Over there. Turn right. Three, four... Let them flutter Pushing onwards into a new era... We are Germany's youth and life. Our motto is "always ready". Socialism, friendship, and life, pave the way to our victory. We will forge our own future. Prosperity and happiness for the Republic. Hoist the flags and let them flutter. Onwards, a new era is beginning. Activists and brigades, onwards, we're building a... They're coming! They're coming! Look at that priest up there. Okay, everybody out! They sure build one heck of a church! - So, here we are. - Well then... There's a priest up there. Nobody look. Man, they're well hidden. Let's get a drink first. Oh, come on, don't be so lazy. This town has never played along. Start at the next house. - Pansa, you've got the posters. - Which one? The one with the picture, but no property damage! No posters on windows this time! You guys start at the other end. - Way at the other end? - Yes. Get lost. Where's the mayor? Dead. Who's here for the first time? Ewald, come with me. - Okay? - Where are the Peoples' Police? We can't just show up here with an armed force. - This hick town packs a punch. - Where do we start? With the first house you see. You staying here? Just wait. They're definitely gonna need us. I'm heading down. Is he in there? He'll come. Get your hands off me! Don't get upset! - Stop! - Get out! You won't get off that easy! I'll be back! Just you wait! - What happened? - Forget it. Colleague G?den? Open the door. Keep going. - Idiots! - Keep going. There you are! You were scared, huh? No need. We're from the Agricultural Production Cooperative. I know. Just leave the way you came. - You're not the first to... - Yes, we're the 2nd wave. And there will be a 3rd and a 4th, and if it still isn't clear that joining the Cooperative is in your interest, we'll come again. We're patient. We'll come till your ears hurt! Even if RIAS calls for you to resist, even if you're the last farmer in the GDR and stubborn as an ox, that won't change the fact that only through an agricultural cooperative can we meet the goals of the five year plan set by the Central Committee of the SED. Don't close the door. You're just wasting time, G?den. Listen, will you? And time? We've got more than you! That's for sure! Stop! Ouch! Open the door! That's no way to treat... You'll see. That'll cost him. Should we get the Peoples' Police? He's the smart aleck in town. We'll see. ONWARDS WITH THE COOPERATIVE So, it's come to this. You really think they'll leave you alone? - They're probably fetching the police. - They wouldn't dare. They don't need that kind of trouble. You'll see what they're capable of. If you'd rather kiss their feet, just say it. At least it would be over. - If you ask me... - Nobody asked you! Father, they're in Johann's pub! There are police outside the church! What now, father? Are we going to flee? Get lost! Wilhelm's taking off. He just sent me - to get a basket for the laundry. - Fine. Leave me out of it. The land reform split everything up into tiny little pieces, and I got one too, and I got a cow, and a certificate from the Russians saying it was mine, that I was a free farmer! And I worked myself to death for that little bit of land! And every year, no matter how hard it was, I handed over the quota that was demanded of me! Just like the rest of the townspeople who used to work for the manor! And now that it's finally working out a bit better, you people come and say it has to be consolidated again like before! Are we supposed to be calm? Are we supposed to be thankful that it's all going to change again? Then why did my wife work herself to death... out in the fields? Why did you even pass the land reform of '46, if I have to hand over my cows again to the big manor stall! And my calves to boot! What kind of people are you to come here like this? Everyday! "Here, just sign the paper! It was all for nothing! Give back the cow! You can... You can go to work." But now, instead of calling it "the manor", now you call it... the "Cooperative!" You... you criminals! You... Why are you getting so upset? We're farmers too. We're colleagues! Nobody's forcing you. You've got it all wrong. Now he's running away, too. Listen, colleague. Stay here. You're only making it harder on yourself. Then we'll wait till he comes out again. Tonight at 8 PM at the village pub! Tonight at 8 PM at the village pub! Tonight at 8 PM at the village pub. A big debate! Tonight, big debate in... Speaker from the Cooperative... - Were they here too? - Yes, you too? You bet! We're staying. The Cooperative isn't mandatory. - And living in a refugee camp is the pits. - Look. Ms. Kahnbach. But they left for Berlin last week. Only Adolf and his wife. The old man stayed home. Come on, let's go. Come on! - What's she doing? - But that's Adolf's cow. - Man, I'm taking off. - Wait a second. ONWARDS Hey! See you later. Working cooperatively... ...for peace. You kids better run on home! Come on. Come in, colleagues. No need for false modesty. Why are you standing around out here? Huh? You're not usually this timid. We'll have a beer together first, of course. It's not as bad as it seems. Hi there. - Hey, Paul. Come here. - Come here. - Three beers. - Thanks. - Two beers. - Good evening. Come here and sit down. So, I guess we're all here. Let's start the meeting. Dear colleagues, we've gathered for a debate tonight that's of the utmost importance for the economic interests of our republic. You all know what it's about. It's about consolidating all small agricultural enterprises into the big agricultural production cooperatives of our republic. Excluding yourself from the community is unacceptable. Not only the small, inefficient... He's doing a good job in there. He's really roping them in. Come on, people. We can't stand around all night. We've got patrol duty while all the farmers are here. ...with bits of land scattered across the country, undermines the production advantages of the Cooperative. That's why all farmers should team up as part of the Cooperative. But I keep hearing... Please let me finish! I keep hearing you say you've worked very hard and that you don't want to contribute to the pot... What happened over there? You guys lost your marbles, huh? Look what happens when you stand around blabbing. Hey you! Hands off! What a damn mess! ...where does that attitude come from? I'll tell you... Crosses. Just you wait. Has anybody seen the priest? Rip them down. They'll be replaced. You come with me. The others stay here. Go on ahead. ...It's not just about that. We must keep asking ourselves if you can achieve anything comparable under current circumstances and with current conditions. That's what it's about! Let's get one thing straight, colleagues: The thousands of farmers who have already signed, and who have already worked in the Cooperative for years, they're better off! There's absolutely no question! Did you say something, G?den? Why did you take our IDs? Are we still under suspicion of absconding? Here they are. I'm authorized, because you have no mayor... Our mayor is in West Berlin. Cheers. Because you have no mayor, I'm authorized to return them to you. I've heard that Mr. G?den has been playing mayor. Perhaps Mr G?den can give us a summary of the situation in town. Maybe G?den wants to give an opinion. How about it, G?den? I'll sign. - What? - Impossible! You'll join the Cooperative? I'll sign. My rabbits and the chickens? Will they own them too? They'd own to them too. Everything. They'll own everything! But what if we flee to Berlin? We'll have a farm again. One that belongs to us alone. Forever. Come here. Watch out. - Let's walk for a while. - Will we get a farm in West Germany? I bet they can't wait. They've already expropriated over 30,000 farms in West Germany. Propaganda! That's all you learn at school! - You said we'll fly in an airplane. - Yes. - One with four engines. - Yes. If your father comes. You're stabbing us in the back! No question! Even if you don't have anything... I don't get it! I just don't get it! You can't just sign it! Leave colleague G?den alone. He's the only one who thinks, who uses his head! You'll be a nice, strong agricultural production cooperative. I've even got a name for you: The New Future. What do you think? The New Future. She fled! Your wife is gone! She fled! She fled! - You're mad! My wife would never flee! - It's true! - She left on her bike with your son! - The woman's nuts! They snuck behind the house wearing mourning! - Wearing mourning? - So it looks like they're going to a funeral. - Have you had a death in the family? - That's easy to find out. You should be ashamed of yourself! Wait! I want to say something. Can I speak with you alone first? Okay. Wait here a moment, okay? What's that supposed to mean? - What if he did flee? - There's no way! - Get her out of here! - You think he'll let him go? Just wait a second! You're worse than the children! - Shall we listen to some music? - Oh, yeah. I have something to say. G?den is taking us for a ride. This stinks to high heaven! What could he possibly say to that guy that we can't hear? If you want to be an employee, if you want to contribute to the big kitty, that's fine with me, go ahead. But me? I'm not playing along. I'm going home. I hereby withdraw my signature. Good evening. Stay here! Have you lost your mind? He's gone! He's gone! Where is G?den? Go! Go! Get a move on! He can't be far! - Berger! Berger! - Yes, what is it? Report this to the police right away! Erich! Erich! I'd sure like to know what kind of game you're playing. You left with G?den. And now he's suddenly run away? Erich, what do you want... Identity check. All passengers traveling to Berlin, have your IDs ready. Passengers traveling to Frankfurt Oder please change at... IDs please. Passengers traveling to Eberswalde change in Potsdam at 11:49 pm. Identity check. - Name? - Hermann. Where are you traveling from? All passengers traveling to Berlin, have your IDs ready. Thanks. Your ID. Name? Sch?tte. - Where are you headed? - Berlin. Thank you. Thank you. Your ID. - Name? - Ernst. - Where are you headed? - Berlin. Show me your travel permit. I need to go to the ministry. But I need your travel permit. - I don't need a permit to go to the ministry. - You don't have a permit? Exit the train. I'll hold on to your ID. - Exit the train. - You can't throw me off the train! - Exit the train. - I'm holding you responsible... - Your ID? - ...that I'm there tomorrow at 8 am. - Your name? - G?den. Where are you headed? To Frankfurt, for a funeral. To Frankfurt? You don't need to travel through Berlin. Was it your husband? My condolences. The Party can't afford it. Tomorrow's newspaper better say we've severed ties with him. He's coming. ONWARDS WITH THE 14TH PARTY CONVENTION RESOLUTIONS Come in, Baade. Good morning. Comrade Baade, the district committee has reviewed your activities in agricultural education. Public reaction within your sector has proven that your actions during last night's incident in Wenigenstedt were wrong. Comrade Baade, I'm saying you made a mistake. But I only followed protocol! Don't interrupt, Baade. This isn't just about your success, it's about the success of the socialist structure. What you do as an individual... can put you at odds with the Party. - Even if I acted as instructed to? - Yes. Even then. You must show discipline within the Party. The Party demands that you accept and publicly admit your mistake. You are suspended from all Party activities. Hand over your documents. - But if I... - You just need to believe in the Party. - But... - Drop it, Baade! Okay, I made a mistake, dammit! - Keep your voice down, Baade. - Pardon me, Comrade Weber. I was so proud of my work, and... that's why... Hurry up. Your ID. My ID? Why do you want my ID? Just till this is cleared up. What are you talking about, Comrade Weber? We have to figure out why G?den fled. And if anyone assisted him in his escape. You are under house arrest for the duration of the investigation. When you're cleared of your role in this, you'll get your ID back. - You'd suspect a fellow comrade... - Hand it over. You can't possibly think I'd help a farmer flee the Republic! Baade, trust is a crapshoot. Hand it over. Pardon me. Sorry to scare you. I didn't hear you coming. I need to talk with you. Could you take me along to Berlin? - Just as far as the ring road. - I'm sorry but I don't pick up hitchhikers. Please don't go. I'm not a drifter or anything. I'm a farmer. I have to get to Berlin. It'd only take 30 minutes of your time. - I've been traveling all night. - All night? Why? Look, I'm sorry but... You can't expect someone to just take you along. We're in the Soviet Occupation Zone, after all. To be honest, I'm a refugee. Don't worry, my wife and son are already in Berlin. As long as you don't speed, no one will stop your car. Just let me out on the border to Berlin. It's only 100 km with your car. Yes, but... I'd really like to help you, especially since you're a refugee, but what happens to me if we do get stopped? - Maybe they're looking for you. - Me? I'm just a farmer. I was supposed to join the Cooperative, the agricultural production cooperative. - Give everything away. - I read about that in the paper. But can't you take the train like other refugees? - No, they already know I'm gone. - They know? Yes, of course. I had to stay until my wife and son... But they won't be looking for me. But my name is already on the wanted list on the trains. How will you cross if you're on the wanted list? You don't need to worry about that. - I'll be fine once I get to the ring road. - But how? There are plenty of lakes around Potsdam. A little hike and a swim... Swim? But there are guards everywhere. What if they shoot? I'll get through, with a little help from you. Well... Can't you just... hitch a ride with that truck? That's how I got this far, but you can help me the most. I'd rather not. You'll cause me all sorts of trouble. I can feel it in my bones. I'd rather you stopped asking it of me. Yes, of course. Maybe I should wait for a car from Berlin. You're Swiss. Berliners are more understanding. Sorry to bother you. What difference does it make if I'm from Zurich and not Berlin? Look, I'm a journalist. I can't risk getting caught with a refugee in my car. I was just asking. I'll find a way... somehow. Wait! Just a moment! You'll be in Berlin in 1.5 hours, - right? - Yes, so? Could you call my wife for me? At the Marienfelde refugee camp. Just tell her you saw me. That I'm on my way. Tell her... ...I'll be there by tomorrow night, she shouldn't worry. Of course. I'd be happy to. Wait! What's your name? G?den. Hermann G?den. Can you remember or should I write it down? G?den, and my wife is Anneliese G?den from Wenigenstedt. OK; just get in. I'm sure we'll be fine. - I don't want to... - Just get in. Push the button. We'll see who gets the short straw. After I was recommended for the academy... And I warned them about operations like that! We'll see. You're kidding yourself again. The decision was unanimous, there's no changing it. If you go to Berlin now before this gets cleared up, it'll only make everything worse. And if you're seen outside the city without your ID, they can have you arrested. Well, is that what they want? You'd better believe it, just to get back at me. Those squares! You're too young for me. Lard again? It's too risky. If they catch you traveling in secret, they'll arrest you on suspicion of absconding. Nonsense! They'll pull you off the train without an ID. You're doing them a huge favor. They need someone to take the fall, and they chose you. I can already see the headline: "Comrade Baade an American Agent." "Comrade Baade Arrested While Fleeing to Berlin". I'm going to the Central Committee. I'm allowed to go to East Berlin. I'll get to Walter Ulbricht, even if I have to walk to Berlin! - Where's my bag. - I'll get it for you. I'll take you. Hold this. - Go on, unless you're scared of your dad. - Don't be silly. I'd like to know how he knew I was here. Your mother probably told him. She saw us last week. - There's no keeping secrets from her. - We'll see about that. She's probably waiting for you at the station. Let her wait. Here are your sandwiches. I doubt Comrade Ulbricht will invite you in! Now you're spying on me? You're scum. I only came to warn you. - The police are after you. - After me? Why? You're nuts! A half-hour ago, two men came to our house looking for you. They turned the place upside down. They thought we were hiding you. They threatened us. - Why did they search your place? - They searched your place too. They said you probably fled to Berlin. Me flee? Don't make me laugh. You'd like that, wouldn't you? You always expected me to get arrested! How many times have you told me I'd end badly? Huh? I only came for your mother's sake. You know you've caused her enough trouble as it is! And if you ask me, you will end badly. - But maybe you'll make it to West Berlin. - West Berlin? Is that the best you can do? You don't get it, and you never will! You screamed "Heil Hitler" for 12 years, and now you act like an avid socialist. Right, don't step on anybody's toes! My father's pretty clever. Neither the Nazis nor the communists can touch him. You should flee to West Berlin! I bet you're a fan of Adenauer! - You're good at adapting! - For the last time! I forbid you to speak to me that way! You know what I think of you! - I only came for your mother's sake! - Because you're afraid of her! You don't want any trouble with your wife! You make me sick! You've been angry your whole life, but you never fought back! You're a poor, pathetic fool! Don't you see? Aren't you going to hit me? No? No. You can tell the police I went to East Berlin to fix this, even if I have to go to Ulbricht himself! Hello! Watch out! Are you nuts? Don't ride on the sidewalk! Did you hurt yourself? You in one piece? I'm going to Berlin to meet Ulbricht. Good. Ulbricht good. Hello, grandpa. How are you? Forget him. He's an old Nazi. Come on. - No, not old Nazi. Good old man. - You wouldn't understand. Give me a lift to the barracks? Don't you drive on the sidewalk again! Aren't you driving a little too fast? You're not allowed to drive faster than 100 km/h. We're almost there. Maybe another ten kilometers. I can make it the rest of the way. You can let me off here. I'll take you the rest of the way. Hopefully you'll make it by the end of the day. Though I don't know how you'll ever get to West Berlin. What is it? Keep driving! Keep driving! - Keep driving! - No! - Are you crazy? No! No! - Let go! For God's sake! If they catch us, it's over! Another one! Hey, it's the police! I'm sorry, but if they catch me I'm done for! But... you can't just... Stop! Freeze! - It's not my fault! - Stop! Come with me! But I didn't... I don't even know him! You disobeyed traffic signs! Where is the guy? You'll pay for this! Civil disorder, criminal assault! I'll get you for assault too! I'm going to make a complaint. Oh, my God! Where is he? Come out, you swine! I'll get you! Don't move a muscle or I'll shoot! Come out! Help! Help! Help! Wait! Please! Please take me with you... Come on! Come! Oh, you always say that. Now I'm supposed to believe you? So? What does it matter? I'm through with him anyway. SIGNAL STATION 34 Hurry up. 1146 is on its way and Karl won't be far behind. What's wrong? We're married after all. This line gives me enough trouble as it is, and if I work on Sundays you always complain. You're always in a rush afterwards. - Somebody's out there. - Who? Karl? No. A stranger. - Where? - At the edge of the woods. Don't let anyone see you. It could be sector patrol. Good work, comrade. What are you doing here, anyway? Party inspector. - Who is that? - He says, Party inspector. Party inspector? He's coming. Who are you? A Party inspector? My name is Baade, I'm from Party leadership in Wittenberg. - Wittenberg? - Yes, we're assisting here. I know you're from the Dessau sector, but... we're conducting a search for agents. I was assigned this section of railway. - Have you seen any suspicious individuals? - No. - And yesterday? - No. - What are you doing now? - Me? I'm done. My shift was from 10 am to 6 pm. Eight hours! Don't you ever fall asleep? It can happen. I've seen some crazy things. Watch out, comrade. They put firecrackers on the ties, especially now that it's warm. They mess with the signals, - You have to be alert! - I know. We have our training. Well, if anything happens in your district, comrade, - it's your fault. - Yes, sir. Now I've got to transfer 1146. Good God, they're waiting! Tell me, does the 1146 go to Berlin? No, comrade. - Where to then? - Only as far as Potsdam. Of course. - No trains go directly to Berlin anymore? - Sure they do. 1187 goes from Halle to East Berlin. Comes by here every morning. And the vegetable train: 2211. That'll come by here too. 2211... When does it arrive? Sometimes mornings, sometimes evenings. It's scheduled for 7 pm today. I'll be off duty. - You'll have to ask Karl, my replacement. - Yes. And what about... - Where is it going? - It's the International, heading for Sweden. I see. Tell me, - do you get refugees around here? - Refugees? No, not that I know of. You mean, traveling to Berlin? Not that I know of. I heard the train goes so slow here that people can jump on. Here? I doubt it. Maybe in Medewitz. They're building a second track. Okay. - Medewitz. - But that's at the 39th kilometer. That's signal station Belzig West. We have nothing to do with it. Okay, then I'll be on my way, Comrade... What was your name? Dreyer. Heinz Dreyer from the depot. Keep your eyes peeled. Vigilance is everything! Spread the word to your colleagues. Thanks, Comrade Baade. You can count on me. I see that. I'm glad. - Goodbye. - Thanks. Goodbye, comrade. Rudi! Rudi, you have to help me. I fled. I need to get to Berlin. Get down from there. Come with me. Come in, quick! You can't be seen here! It's broad daylight! I've got enough trouble as it is. Come upstairs. Careful. The walls have ears. We can talk up here. You've got a car. Nobody would notice if you drove us to Potsdam or Teltow. Nobody would stop you. You're a big shot in the Party. I can't. - But... - They're not just watching the highways, they're watching all the roads! I have a family. I have a wife and child! I can't risk getting caught with you. You sang a different tune when you were the one who needed help. I should've known. Don't get personal, Hermann. If you had given me a little warning, I could've helped. You show up out of nowhere and expect me to drive you to Berlin? To Potsdam and not a step further. If I was alone, I wouldn't have come here. - Don't talk nonsense. - Maybe I made a mistake. - Maybe I should've gone to the police. - Calm down. He'll help us. We were in the same company in the war and we went AWOL together. - Haven't I always helped you? - Yes, back then. - But now that you're a fat miller... - Oh, come on! You don't need friends! You just let them rot! What do you know about running a mill? The inspectors, the spies! Nothing goes unnoticed! They're just waiting for me to slip up! Then just leave. Leave! That's always your answer! When things go wrong, you just leave! You have nothing to lose! You stayed in that hick town in '45. You grabbed the next best farmer girl, and took over her farm. But this is my mill! I built it with my own hands! It's gonna take more than this for me to abandon it! Fine, we'll do it on our own! Come on! I hope you end up in Siberia someday! It won't be long now! Don't worry. We can make it on our own. Careful. Wait! I'll drive you. - The train's gonna stop again. - No, it's just a construction site. Somebody's back there. - He's jumping on! - Impossible! - He did it! - A refugee! - Would you look at that! A refugee! Comrade Lieutenant! A refugee! - What's going on? - A refugee! Comrade Lieutenant! A refugee jumped on board! What's going on here? Where is he? I don't see him! - In the brakeman's cab, Lieutenant! - The brakeman's cab? Let get him, boys! I bet it's a refugee! - We'll get him, Lieutenant! - Hey! This is no time to sleep! Come on! Bring your pistol! Split up! You stay here. I'll jump! Jump off the other side! Get on the last car, understood? Go! Bravo, Lieutenant! Go, Wesenberg! End of the line, boy! BUILDING MISSILE BASES MR STRAUSS? YOU CAN SURELY COUNT US OUT! Go on, Wesenberg! - You'll see... - Be quiet! Man, look at that! Fantastic! Hello, colleague. Can use your office? - He's a stowaway. I need to make a call. - Sure. Come with me, I'll fill you in. Bravo, Comrade Lieutenant! Shut up! You've got three seconds to disappear! - I'll make mincemeat out of you! - What's with him? Oh, come on. What did he do? - He's a stowaway. Call the Transport Police. - But I'm in the Party. - Shut up! Call the police! - We have no Transport Police. I'll have to call someone on the line. You're a comrade, eh? - And you weren't fleeing to West Berlin? - That's right. I need to get to Belzig. You'll pay for arresting me, and... Medewitz Station. Is this Eugen? Yes, I've got a problem. Have the Transport Police been there yet? Lieutenant Steiner, 10th Artillery. I caught a refugee fleeing to West Berlin. Send the Transport Police to pick him up immediately. Of course. What? - The 11687 - Yeah, yeah. Okay, I'll clear it right away. Yes, the 1168 on track 2. Understood. Yes sir. - I have to go clear the track. - What about our train? Yeah, yeah. You'll get another car, but first the 1168 has to pass through. Wesenberg, you twerp, don't move a muscle! If he runs, show him what a good shot you are! Yes sir, Comrade Lieutenant. You can't do this to me. You'll pay dearly for this! Just you wait! I've got nothing to do with this. I... Eugen? Yes, Eugen. Send the 1168 on through. Yes. Yes, the track is clear. Where's your superior? Should he stay with me? The police could be awhile, especially if they're doing rounds. If all he did was ride without a ticket, then he can buy one now. I'll write him a ticket. I don't know. I don't think... You'd better not. Listen, I don't want any trouble. This doesn't happen in Medewitz. If somebody dodges the fare here, then he has to pay. That's all. Nobody's got the right to come in here with a gun. It's not his fault. If he had his way... right? If you're broke, you can borrow from me. You can send it to me. But I don't want any trouble here! And this is an office, anyway. The rules are up there. "Only employees of the East German Railroad and its facilities are authorized to use this room". Yes? Yes, Eugen. Yes. Yes, yes, Eugen. Track 2 is clear. The vegetable train is on track 1. Good, good Eugen. I have to get out there again. What a disgrace! Would you really shoot at me? If you don't... I have no choice. I've got nothing against you, really! You bastard! What good is that to me? Come on! Let me go! No, you can't do this to me! Asshole, you'd never shoot a comrade! Not you! No! I don't want to! I'm coming! I won't stay here! I won't stay here! Then come with me! - Where are we? - Schwielow Lake. West Berlin is on the other side? We're swimming across there? For the love of God! It's way too far. That's West Berlin, over there. We'll follow the shore past Caputh. We're not there yet? I can't go on. I can't go on! I can't go on! Listen, the worst is already behind us. I'm very sorry, but... It's my fault you ended up in this mess, but... I don't blame you. It's my fault. - I shouldn't have gone with you... - Stop that. You've been doing great. And I'll tell you, if you're worried about your car, I'm sure you can do something, as a Swiss citizen. Maybe through your embassy, or your consulate. Really. I didn't mean for this to happen. I'm not sure how it happened myself. I only wanted to ask you for a ride. You're Swiss. You don't know what happens when they catch you. I was held prisoner in Russia for five years. For doing absolutely nothing. When you experience something like that... What I'm trying to say is... You did the right thing. At best, they would've put you in jail for a few weeks. I know I've brought this upon you. But I swear to you, I'll get you to West Berlin in one piece, even if I have to carry you there. Take a look at this. Here, this is Berlin. This is West Berlin. And this is the Havel River. The border runs through the middle, as far as right before Potsdam. And this is Potsdam. We're here. Now we have to try to follow the shore, past Caputh, a small village. - Hopefully they're all sleeping already. - How much farther is it? To West Berlin, the Havel? Not far at all. Potsdam is 10 or 15 kilometers away. Are you mad? We've been walking through the woods all day! Crawling through the brush, hiding from every cyclist! I can't take it anymore! I've never walked so far in all my life! My feet are covered in blisters! How many kilometers have we walked? 30, 40, 50? - Listen... - No, no, no! I can't go on! I can't go on! You keep telling me "just over that hill, just a little longer". I can't go on! I'm sure you can do it, but I can't. Just leave me here. I know why you took me along. You have a guilty conscience. You didn't do it for me. I keep thinking about the story you told me about the farmers in your village. How you fooled them. Now you're afraid that your guilt will grow and you won't manage to escape. If you help me, you think you can free yourself from your guilt complex, and you can make a deal with fate. What do the farmers have to do with you? Never mind. I studied psychology, that's all. - I'm ready. What happens now? - A motorboat is coming. Maybe they can take us to Potsdam. Skippers are always open to negotiation. Stupid oaf! I'd help, but I've had it! He's gonna fall in, to boot! Come on, damn it! Come on! Get out! Get lost! Go! I'll break all the bones in your body! You puked all over my boat! Get out! Go on! Get out! I'll feed you to the fish! Hey! Get off my boat! Out you go. Adios. Go home! Stop! Wait! - Stop! - Rascal! - Wait! Take us with you! - Son of a bitch! - We want to come along! - There! Bastard! Stop that! You'll kill him! Take us with you! You're going to Potsdam! Come on, quick! Jump! Stop, he'll drown! There! Help! Help! Help him! He'll drown! Help! He can't swim! He's drowning! Help! Help! There! Look! Help him! Come on. He won't drown. - He's just drunk. - What kind of people are you? Liquor is the only thing that's really good here. But he's still so young! Young people drink the most. It's Saturday. What else is there for them to do? Come on. Where you headed? I'm only going to Hermann Isle. - Not Potsdam? - That is Potsdam. - Where do you want to go? - To Potsdam. We'll come along. No thanks, I'm okay. - I'll pay. How much does it cost? - Forget it. It was just a company outing. It's on the house. Thank you very much. You had your hands full already. Starting early this morning, I've ferried the drunkards around. All the way down to Ketzin. And that drunken guy hid under the bench, and puked all over the place! I let him have it. Cheers. Want a swig? You trying to get to West Berlin? West Berlin? What makes you say that? So, yes, you are. You don't have to worry about me. But don't cross at Glienicke. - Or at Griebnitz Lake. - Why not? They've blocked it all off. Laid down barbed wire, mines. Posts within eyeshot. What would you do if you had to get across? - Tonight, you mean? - You bet. Sacrow. What did you say? Sacrow. Don't you know Sacrow? Directly across from Nikolskoe... On the Havel. Wesenberg? - I think we're in Potsdam. - Where? Potsdam? - Then we have to get out! Right? - Why? Not me. If you're going to West Berlin, then go. - But... - Try to cross the Havel. But where? I don't know this area! You should've thought of that before. Enough already! If you'd called like I told you to, you would've gotten three days in jail. - Now you're a deserter. - I couldn't shoot! Quiet! You think I want to get caught with a deserter? - I'm going to East Berlin. - Take me with you. You're nuts. The only thing I can do is throw you out. If I take you to East Berlin you'll just take the subway to West Berlin. No way... I hope they're not unhitching our car. - Stay here. - No, take me with you! - Shut up! You're a soldier. You should've been a priest. It's almost light out. What am I going to do with you? Go on, get your truncheon. - Fix your clothes. - My cap! - It's broken. - Forget the cap! Come on, button your jacket. Listen up. I'm going to take you to a place where you can swim across the Havel. I'll push you in the water and... if you drown... then it's your problem. So, Wesenberg, you twerp. Look at this. We're here. This is Berlin. This is the Havel, this is Potsdam. You swim across here. We have to make it there, understand? Walk behind me. If anything happens, if anyone asks... Oh, it's no use anyway. Wesenberg... Get a hold of yourself, man! Come on. Flat on your face again? Hurry up, it'll be light in an hour! Stay behind me, understood? Irma, there's no stopping you. Come here, kitten. - Don't you hear it, honey bun? - Hear what? Come on, kitten. Come on. The birds! - Wonderful! - What? The birds? Come on. It's only six in the morning! - Six in the morning! - Come on! - Let's get up at six every day! - Come on! Come on, kitten. - Come on, will you! - Let's start a brand new life! - No! For the love of God! - No! - Come on, will you! - No, come swimming with me! - No, I don't want to swim. - Oh, no. - But... - It's still so early, come on. - But I don't want to swim. - I want to swim! - Let's jump into the waves... - Don't do anything stupid! - ...and swim and... - Kitten, stay here. - ...and wash the filth of the night away! - Be reasonable! Stay here! But, kitten! Kitten, come back! Be reasonable! Don't do anything stupid! - Come on, kitten! Come on! - Sweetie! Honey bun, come on in! It's gorgeous here! Kitten! Come on! - You know what? This stinks! - Gustav, old boy! - Hello! - Hello. Come in, you two! If you keep this up, I'm done! I'll hit the road! Ah, beautiful Irma, who else. Come on in! Come in! Come on in! Here, in the cove! Here! - Where? - Over there! - There? - Good lord! - A comrade! - What if he's alive? - Do you want to walk on a mine too? Yes, thanks again. It's crawling with Police around here. Is that always the case? This is a zone border district. I've learned to ignore them. I don't care, as long as they leave me alone. I used to have a general store... in Potsdam. Now it's run by the Trading Organization. My wife... was put into a sanitarium in Beelitz two years ago. Consumption. She's got it good. If you get sick over there, they take care of you. If I ever get sick... I'll just join my wife. Things will change again. No one believes that anymore. We thought the Russians would be sensible, and Ulbricht would make a deal with Adenauer. I wouldn't be surprised if they close off West Berlin. Then we might as well forget it. I'm just a farmer. The old man says the ferry hasn't run for years. The street is blocked off with a barrier. But people go swimming here anyway, and they leave them alone. It's about 600 meters to swim to the other side. - How tired are you? - Not that tired. We have to walk down Spandauer Str. until we come to the woods, and then go down to the shore. What is that? It looks like a body. They're busy! We'll use that to our advantage. - Have we paid yet? - I took care of it. There's a man swimming out there! Give it to me. - You'd like that. - Look! He'd better stay over there. You got a good card or what? Why should he stay there? - Because there's a patrol boat out there. - A Police patrol boat? Where? By the buoy. Don't you see it? Where? By the buoy? Oh yeah! Are we playing or what? They've seen him now too! It's just a dog. You should get your eyes checked. What? But somebody was swimming out there. - Where is he? - Here. See for yourself. Well, I'll be. I could've sworn... - Turn around at the buoy. - Okay. I beg your pardon. Come on, quick! Come here! Watch out! Can you see him? I bet he swam across. - So? He'll find his way back. - And if he doesn't? Hajex? What would he want in West Berlin? EAST GERMAN POLICE HUNT FOR TOURIST - A dog with a badge! - Maybe he jumped off a truck. We'll see. Come, let's follow him! - He's going over there! - Is he your dog? My God! Whose dog is that? It bites children! That mutt is running all over the place. Come on, don't let it through! Come here! Come here. Let me see. It's a Potsdam Peoples' Police dog! Communist dog! You idiot! Here, at the cove! - Bastard! - I'll kill you! - I see you botched your escape to Berlin! - Are you alone? I bet you'd like to know! Who's that? Don't answer him. None of your business, Baade. You don't give orders here. - I'd rather kill you than surrender! - Don't shoot! I'll kill you! Stop it! Don't kill him! Make sure nobody comes! Another word and you're through, bastard! - Is anybody coming? - No. Who is that? What did he do to you? He's the kid I told you about. He's responsible for all this! But he's just a boy! Let him go! Don't you defend him! A boy? He's one of their most devoted comrades. He's worse than ten adults! You should've heard him at the tavern! But he looks so young! Of course! Young people are the only ones who still believe in Ulbricht! You listen here! Who else is out here? And don't you tell me you followed us alone! I bet you've got us surrounded and this is a trap! But if anyone else comes, I'll shoot! And I'll save a bullet for you! - Out with it! How did you get here? - Just you wait! You'll pay dearly for this, G?den! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! No! You'll kill yourself! You're both Germans! So, G?den. It's the end of the road. What do you want? Just shoot! Freeze! You can't fool me. It's your fault I ran, G?den. Nobody believed you overpowered me. They thought we were in it together. Go ahead, laugh! You won't laugh again for years! I'll put you where you belong! If I pull the trigger, the Police will come running! Then pull the trigger. No! What's that music? You hurt her! Freeze! - Be careful. - You pig! How many of you are there? How many? Just shoot! I'll let you kill me, but I won't let you take me alive! Listen, comrade. Put the gun down! I can explain! Put it down! Put it down! I'll explain everything! Listen! We need to take these people to the next police station! Put it down! Stop! Take off! Run! Go! Swim! Swim to West Berlin! Go! I don't want to leave! Run! Run! - No! Don't leave him alone! - Run! Run! Go! Keep going! Faster! Run! Go on, run!
