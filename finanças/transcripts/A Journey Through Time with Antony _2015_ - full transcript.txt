There is a whale named Alice She does not have any companion, friends or family The frequency of the sounds she makes is much higher than other whales Maybe Alice does not even know herself that she is going through the wrong path When she sings, no-one can hear her When she is upset, no-one comes to her I really want to try and look for her On 31 October 2014 MSN Messenger officially ceased operations worldwide A decade ago it was the first program I installed when I got my laptop What it stands out from others when you log in the two icons spinning together gave me the feeling that, no matter how far apart we would always be connected And I had found a space there to upload my feelings and thoughts My name is Anthony Soon, I'll be leaving Dalian where I was born and raised to go study overseas Before that, I did three things Number one: take photos I took photos of Dalian, the city where I grew up My favourite mode of transport is the tram I'd sit in the very left seat at the back Dozing off from the rhythm of the tram's movements I feel like crossing the city in a split second Excuse me, sir Sir We're at the terminus I'm sorry I took photos of my family Here comes the sneaky monkey Here Take a bite It's still warm, one bite How many times have I told you not to buy snacks from the street before dinner But don't you like them? You better enjoy that while I'm still living... Say that again? What did you say? What you're talking about? Talking nonsense again? You're not a kid anymore Please take a bite One bite Oh, you silly child! Com'on you! Mum I'll miss your cooking so much Once you're away from home you have only yourself to depend on to You'll miss me and my cooking Son Yeah Come, see Now with item no.12, your luggage is all done Oh well, but you've lost your other sock Dad, when I get to Australia they'll all get mixed up anyway You know, my boy One of the greatest joys in life is finding your own order amidst the chaos Got it I found it! I'm sure we'll be together again some day Go get yourself a bigger suitcase Pack your things It's dinner time! Let's eat! Want some chilli? - Yes - It's your favorite - Go on - And this Dalian menzi - Here - Have more Number two: meet with my buddies Sometimes I think every McDonald's is the same Serving the same purpose at different cities It's a place you can always chill out Enjoy a little break from life Why are we having the farewell party here? They got McDonald's in Australia Right, Anthony? It's my idea cos I know Andy's paying There aren't fries this cheap in Australia, okay? There ain't cheap Chinese food as well You only left one line on MSN "5pm at our usual spot" I know we always come here but some of us would've gone to school instead? Damn! Ying's not here yet She would've gone to school, right? What should we do Tony? You think Ying is as dumb as you? Who did you call dumb? My buddies all have different nicknames for me Some call me by my name Right, Anthony? Others call me Andy It's just becos Andy... Some others call me Tony What should we do Tony? Sorry! Sorry I'm late! The visa for Japan took a while Thanks Toto Only she calls me Toto My high school literature teacher said the repetition of words stresses the tone It's delicate, affectionate and profound I wish you guys didn't have to go! Get online more often then! MSN, QQ and all that We know you won't go online when you're busy At least let us know what you're up to Alright, I'll put my entire schedule online School, work and all that, ok? Great! Our schedule right now would be stuffing ourselves and to go watch the fireworks! Ying had decided a long time ago that she'd go study sound design in Japan I admire how she made herself the lead actor in the screenplay she's written for her life As for me apart from knowing I got to work hard I see no role I must play Watching fireworks can be a lonely experience You're alone in the act, even in a crowd Where's everybody? In the crowds over there It's a pretty view from here Yeah Hey, what you doing? Don't tell me you can identify the type of fireworks with your ears just like the anime superheroes? I made a wish A wish? See how fireworks look so much alike shooting stars when they're coming down? I heard that shooting stars have traveled thousands of years before they reach our eyes So I think they're more precious than fireworks And both of them make us feel blessed and loved So when you wish upon the fireworks your dream will come true It's your turn Com'on! Close your eyes Alright I'm not gonna recognize who this is when I turn into an old man I'll take... some more of your nose and ears and patch all these photos together If you can recognize someone just by a detail of their face that particular person would mean the world to you Such an insensitive fool I was that I didn't realize what warmed my heart until I recalled it later Number three: buy a suitcase What's your budget? Around 200, I guess Same here Do you like it? It's big enough If I can't find a place to stay over there I'd live in this Let's see if it'll close Stop kicking me, com'on - Try! - Get in! Hi, we're looking for suitcases How many? 20% off for two This one, two please Please wait I'll take away this one Take away Get in here Lately, rumour of renowned singer Faye Wong's retirement has spread widely Today, Faye's manager admitted that the singer will be taking a break and will not release any albums or films As for how long this break will last she said Faye has no plans at the moment My favorite singer once said if the day came for her to quit singing she'd hope everyone would forget her But how can one forget those who are most important to you? It's almost time for me to leave There's nothing cool or special about me so I can't make a cool speech All I wanna say is please don't forget me Anthony Are you Mrs.Wong, the landlady? Yes, I am When we spoke on the phone earlier I had an image of you in my mind and I painted it. It's for you You look more or less like how I imagined Thank you Oh, yes I've brought the things you asked for They're not for me Come with me. Com'on in Okay Anthony's here Hi What's this? Chin...Chinese...Drugs - Drugs? - No! No! No! No...no drugs... Medicine... Babe I'll get your herbal bath ready! Xiaohei, majors in Veterinarian, is a pretty cool gal Her passion only shines bright when she's with animals Thanks Jiaming, in acturial science, loves spicy food I'm from Chengdu. I like things hot How much chilli can you eat? Numbers are cold, and chillies are hot I guess by adding up the two together he can find the balance of life Thank you Just one box? Custom regulations only allows one Could've asked others to help Pierre was originally called Peter He thinks that's too ordinary so he took on the French version He claimed he's studied Geography Anthropology and Cognitive Science but he failed in all of them Memories for Sale On weekends, he sells bric-a-brac at vintage markets I've always wondered how a China man managed to gather so many Western antiques Waste not your youth Capture the best memories Mister, would ya like to buy or sell? That'd work too It's a gift from Mrs.Wong I'm looking for something to frame it Let's see Look how great the old ones were And now the one you've got it ain't no bon-ton! No It's Anton I like it I didn't feel anything has changed until I woke up next morning I glanced at my watch 8 a.m. Then I checked the clock on my bedstand 11 a.m. The 3 hours that had slipped away make me accept that I'm far from home This is the western campus You'll find bars, restaurants n' all that here And the lecture theatres? Not sure Did you ever go to class? Not much these 2 years I want a burger, and one beer Do ya want somethin'? Drinking in broad daylight seems a bit... Make that two Thank you Soon I found my first job If you're late, I'll deduct your pay If you smoke, I'll deduct your pay If you talk on the phone, I'll deduct your pay May I ask under what condition you won't deduct the pay? Sure only when you work overtime Our wage is AUS$10 an hour All clear? Nelson! Watch out You'll break all the stock! Mum? It's getting crinkled Mum - Hey, I can hear him - Mum, stand back a bit There he is! - Son! - Move back a bit You're...You're blocking it What? Where am I...? Who am I blocking? Dad It's my nose. Allergies Dad Your dad's gibbering He's talking nonsense Just now he brags about how he can hook this up Fiddling around here and there Then I saw this window pop out and another popped out I couldn't bear it I almost called the computer technician Alright, alright How are you? Have you been eating properly? Everything's quite expensive here Whatever you do, don't save on food If you run out of money, just give us a call Your dad will send it Don't worry about me I found a job here And I'll work hard I'll do my best to earn a living Don't burn yourself out Remember the most important thing is your studies I know, don't worry about it Don't stay up too late Bye Hello, Anton Alright students, welcome to class Books out, let's go! Now picking up from last lecture... Okay, during my lecture I expect complete silence That gentleman talking thinks he's Ned Kelly trying to hold up the rest of the gang What are you doing? The customers will think you're a burglar! Take it off, or I'll deduct your pay! Hey bro Would you mind? It's been there for a week Work is pretty exhausting But when I figure I'm making one renminbi a minute that gives me the strength to carry on Anthony This is yours Thank you boss! Anton The novelty in this city amazes me I think I'll be meeting lots of friends having one adventure after another I always believe that when you've done something right it'll solidify the ground you stand on this planet You'll feel at ease assured Honestly, I'm not feeling assured Is that because I haven't done the right thing making right choices all along? My friends on the other side of the world are you feeling the same? Will we meet the ones who we loved again? Will we reminisce the moments that once touched our hearts? Now I understand why we're having our farewell dinner at this place You can find this chain anywhere I just need to go into one and it'll bring back all the memories of our sweet moments together Friends forever, for better or for worse! I do! You free? Sure, what's up? Wanna try working in a kitchen? The pay is great! Twenty-five bucks! Deal! Where? Great See ya Here you go Oh! Bless you! - Please take this - Oh, don't worry about it. It's okay Have a nice day You too. Thank you What? Sorry, I beg your pardon? It's a long email address I know But now you owe me 20 cents How are you gonna pay me back? Right Could you say it again? Relax! Don't bother about the 20 cents I'm glad I can help you out This is for you Take this instead I want this! An orange has 70 calories This one made me run 5 min for it I've burnt 38 kcal That means if I eat it I'll only gain 32 kcal That's the healthiest orange ever! It's true that girls are experts on counting calories Hey I have to run Bye Oh sorry Sorry - Sorry - Bye Bye Hey Anthony You're here The manager asked me to give you a briefing Go and get changed first This kitchen looks so cool And the food here is super cool There're really strict rules in the kitchen Sourcing ingredients, cleaning the sides and garnishes, the cooking, the plating and the dishwashing everything has its place Why are the chopping boards and knives in different colours? Hygiene is the first priority in here Green for vegetables Blue for seafood Red is for meat Basically just do as they say and watch out for yourself So I'll leave you to it How many times did I tell you this is supposed to be as thin as angel's hair Like this Okay? Thank you, chef! I want a virgin tongue! Him! You? Come over here! Yeah, yeah you...come, come I want you to taste that It's good! It's so good! This beef is so tender! This is amazing! Anton Perhaps it has something to do with how the earth rotates when the water goes down the drain it goes clockwise but in China it goes anti-clockwise How about kids living at the equator? Do they have whirlpools to play with? And for myself I seem to find a motivation to march forward in the whirlpool of inverse direction I dunno what to do My folks are gonna be so disappointed about me switching majors What does cooking mean to you? How should I put it I think everyone in uni they all look so carefree having a bright future and all but not for me I've been quite confused Then I started to learn about Western cuisine and I have a feeling that's what I wanna do Whenever I have time now I'll go and try different restaurants I don't feel lonely dining alone The food here is fresh and delicious It's also very creative I want to create such wonderful dishes I hope culinary arts can become my way to connect with other people and the world I think that if I'm able to express myself through my dish I'd be on top of the world I'm sorry I have no idea, I'm just bubbling Do you know which country that was supposed to rule Australia? Huh? You're supposed to learn French instead Once upon a time British and French navy set off towards the untouched lands of Australia The French ship arrived first The crew got off excitedly That vast piece of land beneath their feet will soon be theirs As the French captain setting up their camp he discovered a species of butterfly that he'd never seen before As an ecologist, he was captivated It was right then that the British ship arrived thinking they'd be returning home empty handed To their surprise, there're no sign of occupation The British were ecstatic and immediately claimed the land for themselves So when the French captain returned the coast with his butterfly the land that was meant to be theirs had slipped from his very fingers You're trying to tell me to hold on to what matters to me However silly it might seem to others? If that's how you're interpreting the story you've made your decision Right Thank you, Ying Toto I believe you'd look really nice with a big white toque on your head Thank you Dad, mum I've changed my major I'm studying Western cuisine I wanna become a chef What? You foolish child You've gone wild huh? Why would we spend so much effort sending you abroad to become a chef? Your mother here is the best cook I could've teach you myself! Mum Mum That's completely different Have you think twice about it? Stop it What's with you? Sit down first... Come, sit down He's gone mad! What's wrong with him? Let's hear him out Mum, dad This is what I want I'm not interested in working with numbers Besides I can hardly imagine putting on a suit and tie everyday in the future I've decided I wanna become a great chef Well... Son, look We don't support the idea of you changing major You see You've been in Australia 127 days In 528 days, you'd graduate with a degree in finance And during this time you've already spent this much Well Whatever Live your life the way you want to Have you lost your mind? Have you lost your mind too? Listen to me, listen - You're both nuts! - Alright, alright Son I think that being able to pursue what you're passionate about it's a blessing As long as you must pursue this passion with perseverance and positive attitude Give it all you've got Some day it'll return your embrace I'll do my best I don't like this I don't like this You don't need make-up in your food Take it off I... I haven't gone a day without make-up since I was 13 I've never had to expel a student becos they wouldn't take their make-up off You wanna be the first? No, no, I'm sorry I don't like this Tie your hair up and take the bracelet off I'm sorry, sorry Can you please change into the right hat? You You're much taller than the gentleman behind you Move to your left I'm your instructor, John I'll be teaching you different skills every class so you gotta bring in all your tools Your full attendance is expected or else there is no way you can complete this course and if you are late... Sorry, I'm late like this You have 10 seconds to do what you think you should do to the onion in front of you Begin Do you understand... Time's up! Stop Describe your onion please I...I lost my contact lens when I removed my make-up so I cannot see anything I'm sorry, I'm sorry It's fragile It collapsed with just one cut There are always onions in Indian food I don't see anything wrong about it at all No I can't see the veins in it It looks Go on It looks like the ones we would throw away at the supermarket That's what I want to hear Anthony is right These onions are about to go bad When onions rot, they let off an unpleasant smell and lose their lustre which is easy to detect As a chef you need to realize right away when ingredients aren't fresh No matter how skillful you are if you don't use ingredients at their prime you'll never be able to create a great dish Now, Serena will start by showing you how to dice an onion Hi, everyone Two steps One, cut along the grain Two, cut against the grain It's better for releasing the flavors and gives a great texture Quiet! You just need to finish cutting before your eyes start to water Start practicing! You need to be at least half as fast as Serena What? Hi! Hi Do you need swimming goggles? I know a great shop Thanks But I gotta go I've found a part-time kitchen job It's my first day It's like every time we meet, you're in a hurry Why are you keeping yourself so busy? You gotta enjoy life! Serena Do you wanna go to the movies together? Sure! You're such a nice guy, Anthony If you said yes earlier he would've gone to the movies alone Bye! Alright, bye! Bye! Let's go Whatever we're cooking in class Becomes our meal that day That's not acceptable You need to really beat air into the eggs, hmm? - Understand? - Yeah Why can't we use electric beaters too? Did you lose some brain cells too When you cut your fingers? What's going on? Continue! I've eaten nothing Been waiting for you all day I know, that's why I made a trip before going to work Good man! My best buddy! You two vultures Here are our herbs We have basil, chillies mint, sage... Herbs add that last little bit of magic to really complete the dish Hi, kids! Hi! This is Phoebe You can pat her like this! There is a Chinese saying "jie di qi" I never get what it means until I met Serena She has come to Melbourne for 3 years and completely integrated into life in the city Every move she makes is full of energy Her every smile is so bright and genuine How about me? Have I... connected with the spirit of this land? - See you! - Bye Hi, Serena Hi! Just then John took us through the herbs garden There're plenty of signs saying "Planted by Serena" Yeah I'll be here on every weekend Let you in on a secret My herbs are super popular I actually think you're gonna succeed in everything Really? I believe so too My biggest dream is to become a great chef and open a restaurant that carries my style How about you? Have you thought of having your own restaurant and what kinda food you'll serve? Yeah If I have a chance I hope I'd open a bistro in somewhere that's nice and quiet The kind where there's a blackboard menu I'd sell coffee and do fine dining as well probably sandwiches and cheesecakes too If it isn't too busy in the afternoon I can take a nap or polish wine glasses In fact I've thought of a name for it Wouldn't it be the name of your dream girl, no? Okay! It's for you I hope your dreams come true To chef! To chef! Chicken is a very dangerous creature It marinates in its own filth from the time it dies to the time you put it in the oven It is a haven for bacteria It's been chewin' nonstop for 3 hours Nothin' else but eating Looks like we won't record much today Let's come back another day okay? It's my friend's birthday tomorrow It's a present for her Oh Your friend's a girl? Huh? Yes Oh Well...you must really like her Hey, he's asleep I'm a koala - What you doing? - I wanna sleep now - What's with you? - You guys should leave Didn't you sleep much already? Happy birthday! Thank you Any birthday wish? Oh! Part of it has already come true The university I wanna get into in Japan they've accepted my application! I still need to submit a sound design project before they confirm my acceptance It's a shame my voice doesn't sound good otherwise I would've been able to help Silly! I'd need to record all sorta different sounds and edit them into a narrative Oh I see Then I can be your assistant Yes sure Hey, bye Hey, see you tomorrow Hello? Hello? Ying Hello? Can you hear me? Toto! Hold on a sec! Okay It's okay now Ying, happy birthday! Thank you It's not midnight here yet Oh right I forgot there's one hour difference It's alright It's not like I was born at midnight anyway Hey It sounds pretty lively over there Are you celebrating with friends? Nah, no-one here knows it's my birthday I'm actually at work Oh? I won't bother you then Alright, talk later Okay, bye Have some Okay These chestnuts are so nicely roasted Hear the cracking sound of it It's so imaginative Sounds like it's bursting in joy? It's the sound of a heart breaking But you're right about how I feel now It's done. Wanna listen to it? Sure Hi, Ying I'm about to go offline Oh...Uh... Is something wrong? Uh...no, um... Cooking There're tons of terms to memorize I got your present Thank you Koalas look so cute, I can't believe how awful they sound Yeah I'm quite jealous of their lives They spend twenty hours sleeping two for eating two for daydreaming and call it a day I prefer striving for what I love while I'm young and able and slow down to enjoy life when I'm old Are you working today? It's your birthday You've worked really late last night I have to work extra hard for my birthday present I wanna get more recording equipment Let's live our lives to the fullest while we're young and energetic! Yeah! What's with you today? Bye bye Anton I'm so young and curious of this world I don't mind pushing the limit And if everyone thinks I'm living the life I guess I actually am or maybe it'll get even better Christmas in Australia is in summer Santa's beard must be a real torture That's why I think he's probably topless while giving out presents Anthony! Merry Christmas, Serena Merry Christmas! Thank you Looking good but I wonder how it'll taste Well How can I live up to your standard? You're the top student Not really Few months ago we have to prepare a dish for creative cooking I thought for days but I couldn't come up with anything Then that I realized I'm seriously lacking in creativity and imagination I was pretty upset with myself Oh yes, I gotta show you Voila! Remember the first time we met? At that time, we're both chasing after an orange My mind was completely blank You're running for it and then I was pulled along My eyes have never left that orange When I picked it up a sudden wave of relief washed over me like I've taken some kinda pill Later while I was holding the orange again my inspiration flowed and I created this starter "That Orange Moment" I've used crab, my favorite and mixed it with orange Given that you're one of the creators You get to try first How is it? Delicious Really? Really You know You're the one who inspired me Thank you Ladies and Gentlemen I present to you, the finest of wines You're drenched! You know Us young'uns need no umbrellas Embrace the rain! I'm told young'uns don't get hungry either I suppose I can skip your share then Please don't! Cheers! Yeah! Merry Christmas! It's kinda funny wearing t-shirts and shorts on Christmas day Pour the wine It's no crime! You're off key! Your wish is my command! Wow, look at the light Reflecting off my bum! - What ya doin'? - A bit warm, are ya? Take that long sleeves shirt off! I'll help! Come on, take it off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Don't! No! Off! Off! Off! Don't! Don't do it! What's that sound? I'll go check it out Quick, come back in My husband's paintings, I must bring them in! Don't you worry, I'll go! We...we'll go! Stay inside! The paintings Don't worry, they'll get 'em Pierre, Jiaming! Let's go! - They're all wet - They'll get them Oh young'uns Quit looking, go! Careful! My husband's paintings are all there You're freezing There's still so many They're all here now Come on Dry yourself off, come here Excuse me, miss Can I have a towel, please? Oh, sorry Here you go The two of you can continue Why you're taking so long? Where have you been? This one got blown far away And based on my regular pace if I ran over 300 metres my energy level will certainly drop Thank god it didn't go further than 300m Go take a hot shower Okay "JIA"? Darling, do you think that ship is bound for China? (JIA) Actually, I know nothing about painting After my husband passed away I just felt like it whenever I thought of him And that's become my way of recording life "JIA" I found it It doesn't say where it's heading Too bad we don't know the destination I only know wherever I'm with you that's our "JIA" (home) I'm grateful the storm didn't blow my memories away I remember every moment I watched him paint My husband once told me here to live in the present I'd say I'm a pretty obedient wife! Thank you my dears - Not at all - Yeah it's nothing Oh right We actually haven't started - Our Christmas feast yet! - Yeah! Yeah! Let's go home and eat, Mrs.Wong - Let's go then! - Come on, let's go! Mrs.Wong You'll get to try everyone's cooking tonight My hometown specialty, menzi from Dalian I particularly asked my mum for her recipe Mrs.Wong This is my signature dish, I'm real proud of it Luncheon meat and frankfurters with instant noodles Thank you Mrs.Landlady These are dumplings from my hometown I made them myself And you must serve dumplings with chilli sauce I'm from Sichuan I made Chongqing spicy hotpot with Christmas ham Bon appetit! I'm starving! Bon appetit! It's the best meal I've had since I've come to Melbourne It's served and saturated in love and friendship 1-2 -3, say Melbourne! That's the taste I'll never forget Breathing the air of Melbourne in late summer time it's already been a year and 8 months During this period of time I've changed my major and in my second year now I've watched a movie saw a theatre production went to two art shows Haven't been particularly homesick but I do think of you sometimes Preserve our youth in memories It's everlasting A new semester I moved into the student dormitory When I first came to Australia I had in my suitcase a duvet bedsheets a ricecooker a dictionary and well wishes from family and friends And this time it's packed full with photos recipes knives and memories that are too good to be true You're fucking fired mate Did you even notice that? Piss off And go collect your soccer bet winnings I can find a job anywhere! We're in a sticky situation here What're you gonna do about that media night next week? I cook, you do the hiring Excuse me Who's this kid? Sorry Such a beautiful place here Yes This was the residence of an English earl It's now a heritage listed building We host events, weddings Can I help you with anything? My name is Anthony Are you looking for help in the kitchen? What do you know? I'm only in my second year at cooking school but I really like cooking Okay, kid! You've got one hour to make me one entree, one main and one dessert The kitchen's all yours If you don't finish everything in time You can show yourself out Roast duck in French style Avocado and smoked salmon salad Flourless orange cake I've learnt them all, it shouldn't be too hard But the duck takes time, the salad needs to stay fresh and the cake needs to cool down No, this isn't easy at all I gotta prepare all other ingredients while I'm roasting in a reverse order Let's do it Done Oh, no! You have twenty minutes left Twenty minutes then outta my fucking kitchen Yes Five minutes left! You can do it You're doing a great job Take it easy. Stop the bleeding first Thank you - Yes - Okay Time's up Take your bloody hands off That looks very nice These three dishes look attractive But you can forget about being a real chef if you can't make them properly The roast duck is too intense The cake is too soft and the flower will fall apart with the slightest touch Sorry I'm sorry I failed you Oh, no. Don't be silly Hey, I haven't finished Sorry You're hired Really? A great chef needs to believe in their own ideas but is concerned about the people that they're cooking for These three courses would've normally taken 1-2 hours to complete And if you hadn't have sought the help of others you wouldn't have completed them in time Cooking is all about mastering teamwork and building relationships with other people Do you wanna be my assistant to the big dinner next week? I'll try... No! I'll do my best! Let's go Kandagawa together Ying How many frames per second in a film? 24 fps What did you record it as? - 25 fps - What? 25 fps We all know that movie camera runs at 24 fps Why on earth did you record it at 25 fps? Where's your attention to detail? How could you possibly mess it up? I'm sorry I'll contact the actors to do dubbing and record the ambience you need Then what's the point of shooting sync sound? Why did we bother huh? Are you aware of what we're making here? It's a film A film! What does it mean to you? It's an art, it's sacred! Not many students have the chance to shoot in celluloid Do you know how precious that is? Every exposure, every shot will last forever I'm sorry. I'll try to make amends for it How? What can you do? Some moments can never be rewound nor edited I understand I'm sorry You hardly understand how that one single frame could mean so much It's raining outside Sorry. The number you have dialled is currently unavailable Please leave a message... Anthony! Anthony! - Come! - Coming Come on guys This is it!

Hopefully tomorrow Fuck! That's it, we're screwed I can't...I can't serve in the dark It's not dinner in the fucking dark! Chef!

Okay Let's do this All the floor staff go n' get the candles Light 'em in the kitchen first n' then the restaurant Just tell the guests that it's all part of the surprise And we're changing the menu Same ingredients, but something that'll suit this fucking situation We're doing...

Ladies and Gentlemen It's now the long awaited dessert time Tony, our executive chef has specially arranged them for you So, enjoy Oh, this looks interesting. Thank you Amazing! Sorry The number you have dialed is currently unavailable Please leave your name and message after the tone (How are you?) (Send to: Ying) The loneliest whale in the world Her name is Alice In this world there are many Alices among us Anton She once said that when you try hard to think of someone's face that someone must mean a lot to you But what if I can always think of hers without even trying? There's a whale named Alice She doesn't have any companion, friends or family The frequency of the sounds she makes is much higher than other whales So no other whales can ever hear Alice? Can she change her frequency? I don't know Maybe Alice doesn't even know herself that she's going through the wrong path When she sings, no-one can hear her When she's upset, no-one comes to her How about humans? Can we hear Alice at all? Yes, we can I really wanna try and look for her You must think this is ridiculous Anthony Are you going to do a recording? Yes Thanks for driving me all this way Oh well, that's how it goes when you don't have a license! How will you get back later? If it's too late I might stay a night here You should head back first Anthony I don't think it's ridiculous Thank you, Serena Drive safe Bye Welcome abroad to the best whale-watching tour Hey, what's your name? Anthony Okay, great Take the flyer. See you on board Welcome to the best... Hello everyone Thank you for joining us on the whale-watching tour Whales are the world's largest mammals They live in groups and mostly communicate through sounds Clap together to a beat and watch them appear Anton I didn't find Alice I didn't see a single whale But I've found where my heart lies Ying! I miss you! Hi! Hi How's everything? Good Isn't this your creation? Yes, I gave the recipe to the owner here You know each other? Yes Actually, he's about to retire He offered to sell the restaurant to me in a very good price Opening your own place huh But John said he would refer me to work in a starred restaurant in Sydney That's great! Which one would you choose? I'd choose you As for the name of the restaurant I can leave for you to decide My English isn't good enough Let's run the restaurant together What do you think? I can't, I haven't even graduated yet Anthony I love you Sorry Don't say you're sorry I just... I just want you to know Are you going to see her? So are you really in love with her? I thought I simply think of her but now I realized that I miss her a lot, and that's different When I think of a person my mind... is clear and straight But missing her it's like I'd make space for her and push away every other thought She's engraved in my mind I can't think of anything but her Well since you won't be missing me Could you at least promise to think of me sometimes? Yes Anthony I hope you will remember that Toto, your suitcase's broken? It doesn't sound right Ying, you didn't even open your eyes and you can tell it's me. You're great Can we drop by the courier desk first? I gotta give them the package Brought something over? Yeah, for free air tickets But I can only stay for 2 days Did you bring a kangaroo? Let's go Here we are Can the suitcase come through alright? Yours could make it through then it shouldn't be a problem Right Here, let me I'm home! Welcome home! Is there someone else? Nah, just a custom in Japan You get home, you'd say "I'm home" Whoever's home calls back "Welcome home" I'm just saying it to myself Same thing in Australia even when we see a stranger we don't say "Hi" but "How are you?" It's obvious you've fit in then Cause every time you text me, you're like "How are you?" Make yourself at home Sorry, it's a bit of a mess in here No, it's fine I have something like this in my dorm too but my photos are normal ones Can you find yourself there? You have a photo of me? Of course That's me? Yep You look different now? I've been cutting my hair now Barbers in Australia are so expensive Let me see Turn around Not bad huh Your hair looks shiny too! If a person can recognize you just by looking at your hair I guess you must mean something to them I'll take you to get a nice haircut! I suggest you take the JR line to see Tokyo Tower Or you may get off half way in Asakusa and visit the temple I'm working on a project and I gotta go check on it I'll meet up with you later Can I join you? Really? That's boring though There's not much to do in Australia. Don't worry I won't be bored Then let's go Wow it's so pretty It almost feels surreal It's not at its best moment yet It's the prettiest when the petals fall Isn't it interesting Chinese enjoy seeing flowers blossom While people here love to see flowers fall It's a part of the installation Once all the components are ready we'll send them to the coast for display Excuse me Excuse me Good job everyone Hello Good morning, sir Hello Thank you very much Oh, good job This project looks impressive We have students from other faculties coming in to help too You're like a leader here The academic hierarchy is taken very seriously here There's no chance a foreign student could be the leader It's my first time participating in a sound installation exhibition It's really exciting It's like a whole new aspect to what we've learnt in class And I got paid! You know, working with people who share the same vision and being able to make a living it's so good so I've been working really hard - Hello - Hello This is ready Thank you This is my piece in the project Can you tell the shape of it? It's a heart! Is this okay? - Okay - Okay - Thank you - Welcome The wind blows through this whistle and it'll make a sound? That's right Pigeon whistle produces lovely sound Hello - Hello - Hello Hold on to this for a sec How's it? Not happy about it Listen Did you feel it? The whole thing is... The metallic pieces aren't interacting It's monotonous It doesn't sound good Kataoka said there's no time to fix it Each one has 750 grams Do you think they'll help? Putting these two together that works perfectly well Then we won't have to change anything! Two become one A match made in heaven! Yeah! Great job everyone Oh! Anthony Toto, Fang Jie Hi, I've heard a lot about you from Ying I'm from Dalian too We went to the same high school I was here a few years earlier Majored in film studies You guys are all so awesome Not really I couldn't find a proper job after graduating Doing odd jobs here and there trying to make a living Take a break everybody Yeah! Let's have a break - Take a break - Thank you Good job Thank you Come. Good job everyone Thank you Good job This is...? Hi, I'm Anthony Anthony? Oh You're Ying's boyfriend from Australia? He told me that I'm so sorry, Ying I misheard "good friend" as "boyfriend" It's okay You guys can't really blame me Ying's such a beauty I can't believe she doesn't have a boyfriend Anthony If your girlfriend know about this I'm sure she'll go mad Huh? I... I'm still single Seriously? A guy who can cook is every girl's dream WeiWei Anthony What's your plan after graduating? Work your way up to become a chef there? I'm not sure yet I believe you just need to follow your passion The future will take care of itself As long as you're happy Here Cheers, Anthony And a toast for happiness Welcome, Anthony! And wish me a safe journey home You're going home? But you told me you want to stay here to become a film director I... I've decided to work for Wei's father What do you mean? Her father is getting old It's tough for him to run the company all by himself I'd be able to help him out Though I'm not a professional in that field I did at least study abroad How about your dream in filmmaking? You don't care anymore? To be honest, Fang feels responsible for me We'd rather go back to China instead of staying here chasing after something unrealistic There's no way we can achieve anything Besides my dad knows a lot of film producers He can introduce Fang to them Right? Yeah The Mainland market is booming Many financiers are keen on producing films Maybe someone will recognize my talent I'll have a chance to be a director and make my own movie That's right Filmmaking ain't the same as cooking a dish It's not something you can achieve overnight Right, Anthony? Someone once encouraged me to hold on to what I'm passionate about Regardless of how silly it seemed But probably only those who really care about me won't think it's silly Congrats Director Fang I'll stay here and make my dreams come true I also had someone who told me that you can't rewind or edit the past It really seems that way now Anyway I won't allow my present to be a mere shadow of my past Com'on, we're gonna miss the last train You know what? When you're shooting a movie both the camera and the sound recorder have to operate at 24 frames per second Otherwise the visuals won't synchronize with the sound One frame off and it's ruined I reckon filmmaking is like living out our lives Every shot is a lost opportunity Every frame has its own regrets 24 fps, 25 fps One frame more and it's out of sync Do you know why I came to study in Japan? I told everyone that it's my dream Honestly I just wanna get close to the person I love To breathe the same air To wake up in the same timezone To feel the rain pouring from the same storm To see the rainbow shining in the same sky If it went well we'd live the same dream That's all I asked for Now he's leaving You said you admire how I take charge of my life and make myself the lead actor in it But the truth is I'm just a nameless dispensable extra I used to think that I'd be happy with whatever role I was given as long as I was in it But now I know it hurts like hell I used to think it will be painful to see the person I love falling for someone else It never occured to me it will be much worse to see the person I love losing that someone Tonight I am not drunk But my heart is broken Ying Why did you quit school? We've talked about it right? Going overseas at the end of second year? Don't be so surprised I can't change my mind now? I just don't get it You always plan ahead Why do you make such a rash decision? I got it all planned that's why I've waited long enough I'm gonna live my life on my terms starting tomorrow Dear Ying This city is so inspiring I can feel my pursuit of filmmaking is coming alive here I'm into visual You're into audio I wish you were here with me Together we'd make this dream come true Fang Jie Sounds like it's bursting in joy? It's the sound of a heart breaking Good morning! - Did you sleep well? - Yeah I'm gonna go to Osaka after this There's a project recruiting I wanna be a part of it I'll go for two months Then what about this apartment? Well, not much I can do about it But it's quite nice to think that there's a city waiting for me I'm leaving tonight I'll make time to see you off It's alright You go do your thing Work is important Toto You don't have to worry about me I'll be fine Oh, wait When I arrived in Japan I saw this scarf in a boutique and I thought of you I never sent it over It's cold here today Put it on Nice I'm here for you "Although we're in different timezones" "There's no distance between us" "Our intimacy brings warmth" "To the lifeless monitor" "Living our lives on our own" "Chasing the dreams we won't abandon" "It's summer here and winter there" "Because of you it becomes enchanting" "Will our love be in sync" "I choose you but you fall for him" "I can only hope" "Fate will bring you to me one day" "Our love is not in sync" "You've already told me in our secret language" "Our hand sign has spoken" "We are best friends forever" "You love the stories that sounds tell" "I love the passion that flavors bring" "Alice the whale sings" "At the frequency of our loneliness" "Falling into the whirlpool of memories" "You've always filled my heart" "Even in my thoughts" "I'm hoplessly thinking about you" "Will our love be in sync" "Or will it end the way like" "The sound of opening chestnuts" "A breaking heart" "Our love will not be in sync" "This will be my last gift to you" "The sound of falling blossoms" "Lightly" "Beautifully" "But silently" I wish I'd graduate successfully I wish I'd get used to life abroad I wish the person would love me back The wind blows through this whistle and it'll make a sound? That's right Pigeon whistle produces lovely sound Pigeons have a language of their own that we don't understand But attached this little whistle on its tail the way she spins, dives and weaves through the air the wind can speak for them I wish I'd given everything in this world that doesn't have a voice a channel to express themselves Even the wind has secrets it yearns to express Please take care of yourself I wish you well I hope that your every dream will come true Someone said When leaves scatter We learn to treasure our time together When petals fall We understand the frailty of our youth Friends forever, for better or for worse! Cheers! It's the people we meet define our lives The buddies who've accompanied me everyone of you has left a mark on me You guys have shaped me into who I am today Be still! Happy birthday to you Dad, mum, let's take a photo 1, 2, 3 My name is Anthony I left hometown in the spring of 2005 I brought with me my clothes my jackets toothpaste made in Yunnan Head n' Shoulders shampoo My laptop is in Chinese operating system novels written in Chinese an electric blanket and even a Chinese cleaver At that time wandering in the city I didn't feel I belong yet I'd keep my head up I feel obligated to make my people proud To keep my spirits soaring high Well done, Anthony You are welcome Hey, Henry!
