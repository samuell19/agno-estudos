Hmm. You missed a bit. You all right mate? Shut that baby up! For fuck's sake, shut up! Thanks, Mandy. Yeah, me and Jen, we're heading back now. We'll see you back in the office. Nothing they can do till Monday. They said they'll send somebody over first thing, though. Hey, it's out of our hands. I don't envy them. Hmm? Child Services. Yeah. It's a bit close to the weekend to be starting another one, isn't it? Oh, it's okay. I'll drop you off on the way. This is just one I was worried about. You don't need to come. Like you said, it's almost the weekend. Fair enough. Can we stop at a shop somewhere? You want anything? No. Child lock. The body discovered late last month has been identified as missing school boy Tate Mathews. Mathews was reported missing last October. Police have issued a statement calling for anyone who may have information. Bit early. What? Trick or treaters. Oh, um, yeah. You got any plans for tomorrow? You got a big party to go to? Nope. Shame. I could see you as a witch. Thanks. - Talking of a bit early. - What? Nothing. Just 'cause you can't have one without going off the deep end, doesn't mean it's wrong for the rest of us to have a couple of quiet cans after a day in the trenches. I didn't say anything. Yes, you did. And I know that look as well. I've been on the receiving end of that one enough. Besides, it's nearly the weekend. It's not like I'm drinking on the job. Yeah, like that's never happened. Oh, come on. That's not the same. What's wrong with a pint at lunch? It's not like you never did... back in the day. Well, I'm lucky to get a lunch break these days, Karl. Maybe you should try and get out and enjoy yourself a bit more. I do, from time to time. The last time you were out, Michael Jackson was still black. Well, he was alive at least. So what's wrong with your laptop? You going old school? It's an old case. Yeah, what's the story with this one then? David Peirce. Jesus Christ. Just out of the nut house for murder. He lives in the middle of nowhere. What are doing going out there last thing on a Friday? He's been evaluated, he's harmless. Besides, he's not answering his phone. I'm worried something might have happened to him. Ha, you're worried about him. Jesus, it was a little girl he went down for murdering. He was a kid himself, Karl. It was a long time ago, people change, you've seen that. Aye, I have, rarely for the better, though. Did you ever think that you might be in the wrong line of work? What do you mean? It's good pay, nine to five, pension? I mean, don't you care about the people we're helping? Yeah, of course. That kid back there, I mean, the poor baby. How could I not? This is different. Well, everyone needs help, Karl. All right, I see what you're getting at. Fine, I'll come. No, I wasn't getting at that. - You don't need to. - No, no. It's not like I had a big night out planned or anything, and... like you said, maybe I should care more about these nutters. - Karl, I wasn't... - No, no. I won't have you besmirching my good name. Besides, if anything were to happen to you, it would be muggins here that would be stuck with your caseload. Okay, fine. Just don't moan about the drive. Me? I wouldn't dream of it. How much further? In a quarter of a mile, turn right. Are you sure you know where you're going? It's been a while since I've been up this way. I'm just following the sat nav. In 150 yards, turn right. Imagine living out here. Boring. I bet stinks as well. You know, farms, cow shit everywhere, not for me. Is this it? Where have you brought me? I thought you weren't going to moan. Mm, it is pretty quiet. It's like a bloody ghost town. GPS signal lost. Looks like shes given up the ghost. In 200 meters, you will reach the Twilight Zone. Back again. Maybe we should ask someone. Yeah. Who exactly? - There. - Where? I thought I saw someone. Never mind, perhaps we should go back. You're the boss. Turn it off and turn it back on again. Bloody thing. Oh, god, give it here. We're not gonna be stuck out here all night. - I've got it. - Seriously? Evening. You scared the shite out of me. Sorry about that. You two just look a bit lost is all. - You could say that. - We're fine, thanks. We're looking for 10 Bell Lane. That place has been closed for years. Closed? How do you mean? Look, we're visiting a client. Yeah, David Peirce. And you two are? Sorry, we're with Social Services, just checking up on him. So you know where it is? Next left, then half a mile. You can't miss it. Thanks. You be careful. Okay. Thanks for your help. Fuck's sake, what was that about? People never forget, Karl. Hmm, you got that right. You have arrived. This is it. Things are looking up. Don't get too excited. Hasn't been open in years. Not since his father was around. The Twelve Bears? Bells. So his old man left him this place. Not too shabby. Well, it is now. Shame. This place is so old. How old do you think it is? He's probably passed out drunk. While we're on the subject, can we hurry this along? You said we'd be back by now. Can you just focus on the job for one minute? He could be dead in there for all we know. Would that be the end of the world? How can you be sure he's in there? I mean, look at this place. So what happened to the parents? They were missing a while back by the looks of it. There's no record of the mum, and the dad's car was found near a reservoir in Bristol. No sign of him? An eye. Excuse me? They found an eye near the vehicle. Jesus. Bet he didn't see that coming. Holy shit. I think I found the cellar. Mr. Peirce, we're here from Social Services. Can you come to the door, please? Brace yourself. David? I'm Jenna Riley, your case worker, and this is Karl Stephens, my colleague. We've had trouble getting hold of you. Do you mind if we come in? Mine's a Guinness, barkeep. So, how are things, then? Have you been looking after yourself, David? Shall we take a seat? Do you think he's got babe station? Look at the state of this place. So much for home visits. So, as I said, we've had trouble getting hold of you, David. Have you settled back in okay? I read that you spent some time up at Overlook Hospital, and you've been back now for almost a month? Have you had any help from anyone? Family? No? So the reason we're here is to check in on you, see how you're doing, that sort of thing. I think you might benefit from some help, David. You know, just while you get on your feet, - help you adjust. - I don't need any help. Just someone to help out, you know. If I needed help, it wouldn't be from you. David. You have got to look after yourself. Do you have any food in? So your parents ran this place when you were a kid. That must have been interesting. Do you mind if I have a look around? - No, I don't... - Okay, cool. No, I don't want you to go down there, wait. Wow. There really is no chance of getting a pint, is there? What a waste. Now we're talking. Do you play? We should go back upstairs. Yes. What's all this about? We really shouldn't be down here. Did somebody break in? They can't get in. Who? David, you don't have anything here to eat. We can sort something out for you. How? It's not like they got a 24-hour hour SPAR. We're gonna have to come back after the weekend. Look, it's getting late, David. I'm glad your okay, but we're gonna have to make a move. Perhaps we can call back tomorrow with some food. We can't have you going hungry out here until Monday. We'll just see ourselves out, okay? You take care. We'll come back? That's rich. You're seriously gonna come back here on your day off, though? You're definitely on your own with that one. I wouldn't advise it, Jen. There's something not right with him. Stop! I can't let you go out there. David. - Get back. - Come on, mate. Now. Sit down. What is this all about? I'm not gonna let them in. I'm not gonna let them. They're not gonna come. David? Shut up! This is for your own good. It's nearly time. They're coming. Who, David? - We're just here to help you... - You can't help. Not even if you knew. Well, then, please tell us. What are you doing with that gun anyway? Is it even loaded? Sod this. - Sit down! - Karl! Sit down. - It's not even loaded. - Don't be stupid. - Are you nuts? - Me? You think this is a joke? You don't know what they're capable of. Get away from the door! It's getting late. At least let us get some sleep in one of those rooms. One with a king size bed if possible. Let us go home, David, please. I can't let you open the door. They're waiting for me. Who? I won't let them in. They won't do the same thing to me. We won't let them hurt you, David. Thank you for calling 999. What's your emergency, please? Shit! David, please! It's not too late. Everything can go back to normal, you haven't done anything yet. Apart from smashing my bloody phone. - Oh, shut up, Karl. - Don't tell me to shut up. It's all right for you, he didn't smash your bloody phone. Well, if you hadn't aggravated him... Shut up! Someone had to do something. - Well done, Karl. - Oh, fuck off. If you didn't have to play the good Samaritan, I'd be home by now, with my feet up in front of the telly, - with a beer... - Both of you, shut up. No one actually asked you to come. Yeah, well, what would've happened if I hadn't? Shut up. It could've been far worse. How could it have been worse... Shut up! Karl! No! What is wrong with you? Someone had to do something. Well, what if the gun had gone off? Fine. I won't bother next time. Bloody hell. And like I said, it's not even loaded. I think it's a replica. You twat. I am so sorry. Put the gun down before you kill someone. And let Kemper get his hands on it? Not a chance. Karl, just... Kemper? Yeah, you know Edmund Kemper, the co-ed killer. Killed all those college girls. Don't move! Okay, I guess we better call the police. Would you mind? Mine's been playing up. - What? - I left it in the car. I couldn't get any signal earlier. Worth a try. We'll have to sort him out first. What do you mean? Well, he's dangerous. We're gonna have to restrain him. Is it okay to do that, do you think? Under the circumstances. You get the phone, I'll wait here. What if there really was someone? What'd you mean? What if he did see someone out there? Don't go out there. Him? You're taking his word? - No, but... - He's as mad as a box of beaver's balls. - I'm warning you. - Quiet, you. Take a nap or something. There could be someone. You saw how the policewoman was earlier. People remember, Karl. Come on. Even if there is a pitchfork wielding mob out there, we'll be all right. We're just doing our job. Fine, give me the keys. I'll go get it. What, you just gonna leave me here with? What, he's not going anywhere. Seriously? Fuck. David, have you got a cat? I think David's got a cat around here somewhere. Yeah? Oh ho, looks like this nightmare is over. We thought it was safer to restrain David until we could call for help. Well, I can see the logic in that at least. He keeps saying someone's after him. Wouldn't be surprised. What, that's all you've got to say? Look, it was awful what happened. I mean, this used to be a nice place to live. But there's still a lot of bad feeling. Once word got out about it, it wasn't long before the holiday camp closed, and then the businesses followed, and a lot of people moved away. It just seemed to be the death of this place. Someone like that should have been kept inside. - That's not very... - What? He's been rehabilitated. Yeah? And how's that worked out for you? I'm gonna have to call this one in. If someone's been victimizing him, we'll look into it. You can come with me. And you, you can keep an eye on him. He should be looked after. Well, I agree. What's he even doing with a gun? Who's there? Stop where you are, that's far enough. Who the hell were they? I told you not to go out. Fuck! What the fuck do we do now? Did you see that? Clean off. Keep it together. We've got to find a way out of this. Yeah. - Okay. - Oh, my god. What the fuck was that? Who the fuck are they? What the fuck is going on? Well? Karl! What? He knows something! He's said as much. Fuck. They're after him. - First the cat, now this. - The cat? I found it hanging out the back. They know what he did. It's her, the girl he killed. Where did you get this? Your car. - But... - They put it there. - Why would... - They know what he did. Who? How the hell do I know? There's more. It says it's linked to a string of other missing children. Do you think there were others? They do, whoever's out there. Well, we're all in danger now. No, this proves they're only after him. What, are you suggesting that we give him up? - Well, I mean, it's... - We have a duty, Karl. I'll do a lot for my job, but I draw the line at being decapita... And what if they don't stop at him? We need his help. We're outnumbered. Now sort your fucking shit out. I'm gonna untie you, but if you try anything. They're back to finish what they started. What? They didn't finish the job 15 years ago, and now they're back for me. Who, David? Why are they doing this? For him. The beast with many names. What now? Well? Well, can you see them? Well? We gotta get in that car and get the hell out of here. How do you propose we do that? We still have the shotgun. We don't know what we're dealing with. Well, so we wait? Well? What is he doing? Oh, for Christ's sake! - Thank you, dickhead! - Shit! Brilliant. Fuck! Fuck! You with the AA? The police car's around the corner. What if they do the same? We better get a wriggle on. Go on then. Why me? Fine. Be careful. She's dead, Karl. Yeah, well, you know. Have you got 'em? Ah, got 'em. Come on, come on. We'll have to go out the back. Create a distraction. I don't know, Karl. We're gonna have to go to... Fuck! Fuck, fucking fuck! This fucking keeps getting better and better. Calm down! This isn't doing any good. They're here for him. - Let's give him to them. - No! What are we waiting for? He's had it coming for what he did to that little girl. - Karl, that's... - Unprofessional? Jen, you're a broken record. - I didn't do it. - What? I didn't kill her. Sure you didn't, Norman. Are you done? If we're gonna get through this, we need to stay calm. If you find anything, mine's a double. Dad's van. Dad's van? It's in the garage. The keys. Well, can we get to the garage? Well, it's worth a try at least. Maybe he's right, we should just wait it out. Wait for what? Morning. Morning? What, you think the milkman's gonna come and save you? Look around you, Jen, this could be our last chance. Someone might've seen that. - The cellar. - What? We'll be safe down there. We'll be fucking trapped down there. Okay, then. We'll get at it through the back. I didn't see any of them round there. We'll have a clear shot at the garage. But we've got to find those keys first. Oh, fuck! Fucking, not the gun, no! Fuck, can you see it? Fucking shoot it! What do we do now? David, grab an end. The cellar, Karl? Really? What are you doing? I don't know about you, but I need a drink. What kind of a fucking bar is this? Under there. You're a dark horse. It was Dad's. Vintage. None for me. Oh yeah? Here's to us. To continued commitment to the job. Here's to doing our duty. Stop it, Karl. You finished? There's still a bit left. Well, I think that's enough. David, where are the keys to the van? You're not still considering going out there are you? Did you see that thing? What the fuck was that? David? You seemed to know they were coming. What are they? Not them. Not them? You were expecting someone else? Does it matter? It doesn't change anything. You're the one that wanted to get out. Maybe it's not such a bad thing to wait till morning. Maybe they'll burn up or something. Vampires, Karl? Oh, yeah, like that's outrageous. Well, what are they, then? Did you see its eyes? You've seen too many films. Well, what, then? Spice? I've seen spice do a lot of crazy shit, but I've never seen someone on spice tear a person's head clean off. Whatever. David, we've got to find the keys. Feel free to chime in with your thoughts. So what was it, then? Did your dad beat you? Did he like a drink? Is that why you did it? I didn't do anything. Sure you didn't. So why are we in this mess? Because of what they did. Who are they, David? Hey. What the hell is this? Did David do this? Is that him? I'm sure it is. What the hell is this? A cult? Michael Peirce, oh shit, his dad. Look. There. It's her, the missing girl. That girl went missing from a campsite. So? So what's she doing here with David's family? - Holy shit. - What? What if it wasn't just David? What do you mean? The girl, what if it wasn't just David involved? There was many more by the looks of it. Oh, come on, Karl, really? I've heard of these cults. Devil worship, human sacrifice. Who knows what they were up to? And what about them out there? I don't know. David! David! No, you can't! Fucking help him, you useless prick! Whoa, what? He's gone, Jenna, it's no good. Get off me! I can't let them have him. I'm sorry. Fuck! Maybe they'll go away now. They got what they wanted, right? I don't think so. Well, what the fuck? He's the one they were after! And that thing in the cellar? Would you stop trying to apply logic to this? Christ. I don't fucking think so! What did you do that for? I need you sober. Yeah, well, I fucking don't. It just doesn't make sense. So why did things never go anywhere with us? Is this really the time, Karl? I can't think of a better time. Probably the last chance, come to think of it. Some people just don't mesh, I guess. - Good stock answer there. - What do you want me to say? We work together. - Now I remember. - What? The job. What's that supposed to mean? You're not allowed to have a life. Bit of fun sometimes. Maybe... Maybe what? Maybe we wouldn't be stuck out in the middle of nowhere on a Friday night with the horde of hell breathing down our necks. Fuck this job. Mm? What is it? Hang on. What is it? I read about this in the news. It was around Halloween last year, he went missing. They recently found his body. When did David get out? It was about a month ago. This one couldn't have been him. - And the old man, - What? maybe he's not dead. - The cult, Halloween... - Come on. Halloween, Samhain, I saw it in a documentary. These ancient druids would gather up all the children for sacrifice. We need to get out of here. - Karl. - Oh, yeah. We go through the cellar. The cellar? Past that thing? It's the best way to get to the van. You think? At the very least, maybe his dad'll have another stash of whiskey down there. That's the spirit. Good one. Never mind. Let's go. Where is it? Wait. Karl. Karl. Fucking hell! Not again! David? What happened? It's good to see you, buddy. I thought I had it there. What happened? We thought you were... You came back. Yeah, you've got the truck keys. I can't drive. How did you get away? I got through the hatch. What, just like that? They didn't get you? I ran. The hatch? Don't worry, I locked it. Well, it is good to see you, David. Karl? What the hell? What is this, David? I must've read this a thousand times. You slept down here? They kept me here until it was his time to ascend. Who to ascend? The beast? Come on, David, you can't believe that sort of crap. What'd you think has been happening? Those things out there are a part of it somehow, I can feel it. I thought that the followers, the acolytes had returned for me, but it seems that someone has been continuing his work. His time has begun. Jenna? What are you doing? Jenna untie us. Trick or treat, Karl? All Hallows Eve, 15 years ago, in this very room, we started something. What are you talking about? Jenna untie us. - This isn't right. - Right? What would you know about right? - You're a worm, Karl. - This isn't you Jenna. No, it's not, because Jenna was never real. Now you're fucking scaring me. They all get scared before their eyes go black. No, not you. You don't know me, Karl. I've lived this lie for long enough. Dealing with the dregs of humanity, it sickens me. The lame and helpless. The species is weak. He will strengthen us. You're scaring the shit out of me. What's going through your head? - You've fucking lost it. - Can't you see? All these years I've been in hiding, running from the light. Now I have David here. He's home, we're home. On this day, I can finish it, begin again. You were in those pictures. You're catching up at last. - And the rest of the cult? - Cult? Only the smallest of minds would see it that way. Sorry, the rest of the rejects from the loony bin. Do not speak ill of them. I'm the only one left, left to serve him. Him, Jenna? Pull yourself together. He is all around us, Karl. You will weep at his majesty. What are you babbling about? You killed them kids. Mm-hmm, just a small offering. But this, the one that got away before we could complete the ceremony. You were always so feeble. You have escaped your fate for long enough, but you will fulfill your destiny. 'Tis a shame your father couldn't be here to see us bring back the morning star. The what? You killed them little kids for a star? You're fucking mental. I can't believe I was gonna shag you. Bitch! Idiot. None of it matters now anyway. When the virgin's blood spills on this altar, Oh, David. we will finish what we started - all those years ago. - How can you be sure he's a virgin? I mean, he spent a long while in jail. You hear stories about soap and showers... We will complete the ritual, and Lucifer will walk the earth again. 'Tis a pity I don't have anything better to offer him than you, Karl, but needs must. Oh, Jesus. You really are off your rocker. - You think the Devil is... - Silence! That's why you came here. Why did you have to drag me into it? You dragged yourself in, moron. And those things outside. They're after you. They're not after David, the poor fucker. He was telling the truth all along. It was you that was after him. Jenna, you gotta stop this. You've opened the gates of hell. What am I talking about? This is fuckin mental. Fuck! Jenna, you don't know what you've unleashed. Those things are gonna kill us all. Silence! Or I will not give you the honor of being the first rendered unto the dark lord. Yeah? - That's not much of a threat. - No? Instead I will cut your balls off and let you bleed out. David, David, come on, we gotta go. Come on, come on. Ah, shit, come on. Come on. Karl! Drive. Okay. You fucking idiot. You broke the ritual. I've waited 15 years. I'm gonna fucking kill you! Karl, you motherfucker! Karl! I'm gonna rip your fucking guts out! Karl, you can't hide, you fucking worm! He's coming for you, Karl. You've earned this, you fucking... No! No, no! No! No! No! No! No! Cheers. Rough night? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. You'd be surprised.
