The winner for Best Actor of the 49th Hong Kong Movie Awards is... Michael Lau I'd like to thank the cast and crew of MY HUSBAND'S GLASSES, especially my co-star, Yuan Yuan who is also my girlfriend. I'm able to win this award because she played my wife. Everytime she calls me "honey", I feel like being myself. In fact, I'd love to be her husband in real life. Please marry me, Yuan Yuan. Do you promise to keep only unto him for as long as you both shall live? I do. Yuan Yuan. What are you doing here? You can't go in. Have you forgotten our oath? Why bring that up? I have never forgotten, when you enrolled into Beijing Drama School, we were forced apart. You know how heart-broken I was? I never wanted to be away from you. Under the moonlight, we made our oath. I, Zhang Xing. I, Ding Yuan Yuan, will always love you forever. I haven't forgotten! Wait! Don't leave me... What's going on? The rocky roads of Daban City are hard and flat, with huge and sweet watermelons. Here lives a girl, named "Cambarhan". I'm sorry "Do not enter." "Romancing in Thin Air" Beauty and Teeny, give me a hand. Ever since his bride ran off... What are you doing? Didn't you hear me? -Michael is here in Kunming. -Who? Michael Lau! He is so cute. The paparazzi have finally found Michael. This morning, they followed Michael to downtown Kunming. Michael has been all over the country running from reporters. The latest update... Michael is spotted in Kunming. Reporters tried to have a word with Michael. I was there this morning, no wonder. Sue, that's your truck! It is! Did you see him? Is he as good looking as he is on TV? I was working, I didn't look. What a waste. Michael's manager Barbara denies it but we believe this is the latest shot of Michael. Rumors about Michael becoming an alcoholic seem to be true. Up next, catch the latest entertainment news with us... Stop watching and get to work. Poor Michael! I hate Yuan Yuan. I'll never watch her movies again. "Caution" "Compass malfunctions due to magnetic mine" Let's go in. Sue, why don't we do this tomorrow? Yes, it's really scary... Just use the rope. "To avoid danger," "immediately return to the original path" Sue, are we done yet? Let's go. I'm scared! I also need to pee. Almost finished. Honey, hurry back. Leave it for now, go to bed. Good night, Sue. Good night. I'm so tired, let me shower first. No, I need to pee. Let me go first. Honey? Honey? Honey? Honey? Honey? Honey. Honey... Beauty! Teeny! Help! Honey. Teeny, Beauty, help! Honey... The boss? Isn't he... Honey... He's not the boss... Michael? Look, Teeny. It's Michael! It is Michael! It's him! Oh my God! Michael, Michael! Sorry to trouble you at this late hour. Sue, is it really Michael? No way! Why would a superstar come all the way out here? You're kidding, must be a look-alike. Give it to me. You heard what I said? Give it to me! Give it to me! Sue... Get out! Sue... Delete it! Now! -Delete it! -Michael. He's really Michael! So? He's just another patient. I'm keeping it for myself. I definitely won't post it on the internet. Yes! I want to show it to my children and grandchildren. Delete it. I've never taken a picture with a celebrity, let alone a big star like him... Delete it. Go to bed! Now! Luckily, no pleural effusion. He'll be fine, it's just a cold. But his alcohol level is very high. Keep him from the booze... What? Your phone. It's just for the patient's record. Give it to me. Morning, how do you feel? Headache, short of breath... Oxygen! Oxygen will do the trick. Inhaling oxygen will help. This is 3800 meters above sea level. The low partial pressure of oxygen makes it difficult to breathe. Where exactly am I? Shangri-la. How did I end up here? We think... we're almost sure you were hiding from the paparazzi... Inhale some oxygen. Better now? Breathe in. You were obviously drunk, then somehow ended up in the boss' truck. You have any liquor? I need a drink. You can't! Right... the doctor said you're not allowed to drink. Please? Teeny... Teeny! Please? No problem, I'll get you a glass. How about this one? Beauty! Teeny! It's nothing... He can fix it... probably. What have you done to my husband's piano? Why did you tear it apart? The Do-Re-Mi keys were broken. They're very important. How can you let him drink? He held my hand and begged. He looks pitiful. Do-Re-Mi can't be missing, Please call your agent right now. You're not welcome here. Welcome back to entertainment news. We just got word, since the pictures of a wasted Michael came out, Ding Yuan Yuan and her boyfriend have been condemned. Yuan Yuan has now returned to Beijing to call a press conference. Let's go over there now... LIVE from the press conference. Thank you for coming. To everyone who is hurt and tormented by the recent events, especially Michael, I'm sorry. I don't expect you to forgive me. However, I will never forget your love and support for these past few years. I have let you down. I am sorry. I really love acting, but the pressure I'm currently under is too unbearable. I also don't want the person I love to be blamed and criticized. I have therefore decided to end my acting career and marry Mr. Zhang Xing. From now on, I'm not a public figure. Please allow us to live a normal life. What are you doing? Going to Beijing. It'll take days to drive. -Give me the key! -No! Get off the truck. Are you crazy? Stop! Stop the truck! Stop the truck! Stop the truck! Are you crazy? Stop the truck! Don't go! He has altitude sickness... Call the doctor. Breathe in... in... out in... Wake up! Look at me... Look at me. Follow me... in... in... out in... in... out in... in... out in... in... out He has acute altitude sickness and is running a high fever. Sue, this way. Sue. I put him on a drip. Give him a new bottle every hour, and check his temperature every 4 hours. If the fever persists, give me a call. You should call 120 and send him to somewhere else for treatment. Sue, he cannot go to the hospital. That's right! Reporters will make up stories about him. That'll be too cruel! Beauty, take the driver's seat. 1, 2, 3... Push! Your husband is dead already! I... I... I mean... he's gone. What's the point of keeping this old truck? He's not dead, he's just missing. Teeny, push. 1, 2, 3, push! Stop here! This way. Come on. Hurry up, give us a hand! Take the rope... The truck is over there... Watch your steps. I'm back! I didn't leave. 1, 2, 3, Almost there! 1, 2, 3, Come on! 1, 2, 3, Almost there! Yes! Here we go! Thank you! Sorry about this... Thank you. Thanks everyone! Good bye! You still have a fever. You need rest. Darling... I've been dead... for a long time. Forget about me. All these years, I have never left you. I've been right here with you. I was worried, now that I'm gone. not sure how you'd get on without me. But you'll get stronger, and manage our business better. I'm both happy and moved. When I see you thinking about me and cry in hiding, it breaks my heart. I don't want to see you like this. Let me go! 1, 2, 3, Pull over here. 1, 2, 3 Secure it with the rope. Hey can you fix the truck? The model is too old, hard to find parts. You insist on using original parts? Then it won't be Tian's truck anymore. Alright, I'll look for the parts in Kunming. I guarantee it'll look exactly the same, inside and out. One more thing... make sure not to fix the Do-Re-Mi keys of the piano. Alright! Tian's piano will be exactly the same as before! When he comes back, he'll find everything just like he left them. Thanks a lot. So pig-headed! Sorry for the trouble. Goodbye. But there's no bus right now. Don't worry, I'll figure it out. What happened to your husband? He got lost in the forest. You were right... no bus. Just creepy sounds... That's the howling of wolves. Excuse me, I saw a bottle of liquor in your room. Can I have a sip? No! It belongs to my husband. You're not doing anything, go pick up some wine for me. Can I? Don't worry, the locals are not nosy. Sure! Michael! Don't go into the forest. Excuse me. Sue told me to pick up the wine. Thank you. Father. It'll be the same as before, right? Yes! No hidden problems? No, don't worry. Beauty and Teeny. Don't ask. They're her husband's belongings. Why are you chopping wood? So I can keep my mind from drinking. I shot a goat this morning. Can you roast it for me? Sorry we don't know how to do it. Don't worry, I'll do it. Thanks a lot, We'll go on hunting. See you tonight. See you. Listen up! For years, Michael has made you a fortune; you can't turn your back on him now. There will be a concert. He's still starring in the movie and will launch a new album. And no compensation for the commercial. End of story. Barbara, this is Michael. Get out! Where are you? I'm worried sick. Are you all right? I'm sorry. My disappearance must have given you quite a headache. Don't worry, I'm fine and safe. I just need time to myself, all right? Okay, I will handle everything. Taking time off is one thing, but you must hurry back. A zillion things are waiting for you back here. Ok, can you find out for me... remember last time we had a roasted goat? Find out how to make the basting sauce. Done! I have Chef Wong on the line. Please hold. I have a question for you, Chef. How do you make the basting sauce for the roasted goat? I see. Thank you. Bye! Where are you? Can you trace the call? Only the telephone company can do that. Call Richard. If you can't find Michael, I want your resignation. Idiot! Here? No, over here. The leak is over here. -Here? -Yes! Right here. It's falling apart. Exactly the same as before. Exactly the same as before. Beauty and Teeny! Give me a hand. The Do Re Me keys are still not working. 1, 2, 3... There! Thanks! "Fan club membership number: 033" Bye... You're a huge fan! If I fix the bike, will you go on a ride with me? Why should I? Where do you want to go? Chase the sunset, like your movie. That only happens in a movie. Take a break... and try my special yakitori. Well? It's good, but a bit too salty. You're right, if you eat it alone. But it's perfect with wine. Want a drink? Haven't had one in days. I'm doing well. Let me have a glass. Just one glass. All right. Hold this. Thank you. Pour yourself another one. Shangri-la is such a beautiful place, except for the altitude problem. I'm still short of breath even now. Remember what you said that night you had the fever? You said, "Darling, I've been dead for a long time. Forget about me." Those are my lines from a movie. Which movie? "My Husband's Glasses". Yuan Yuan was my co-star. The one I won Best Actor, did you see it? What is it about? The husband died in a car crash and the wife couldn't let go after several years. In fact her husband has never left her. He's tortured by watching her suffer but couldn't help. Those line are from the ending scene. The widow puts on her husband's glasses and is finally able to see him. The husband encourages her to let go and compliments her... I'm sleepy, I have to go to bed. Good night. We found this backpack in the forest. Does it belong to Tian? Yes. This is my husband's backpack. Ok. We'll zero in on searching that area and keep you posted. Thank you. The snow came in early this year. I'm sorry we still couldn't find him. Sue, I made noodles. I'm not hungry. I'll leave it out here, if you feel hungry... No, thanks. Sue. Sue. Sue! Sue! Go away! Leave me alone. Sue! I want to find my husband. Don't fool yourself. Your husband is dead. No one can survive the winter out here. Oh my God. I'll get you out. I'm sorry. Don't say that. Don't worry, we'll be fine. I will find a way out. Don't forget, I'm Michael the Superstar. 033, I just wrote this song. Stop! Here they are! Sue. -Sue. -Hurry... Sue. -Sue... -It's them! Hurry! Sue... Hurry! Sue! Are you all right, Sue? -Michael... -Sue... Can you tell me, what happened between Tian and Sue? You have something to do with it too. You all right? Don't panic. Come on! I'll lift your legs... Easy... Follow my instructions. Breathe in... in... out in... in... out Don't worry. These are symptoms of altitude sickness. You'll be fine after a shot. Drop your pants. I could tell then, Tian had a crush on Sue. Sue also loved this place, so she decided to stay for her winter break. Excuse me, have some more. She worked part-time at the motel. Watch out, it's hot... Stop! Hurry! Go to the cinema. Hurry... Make a U-turn. Turn around! My fan club membership number is 033. I loved him since day one when he first started out. He can sing, act, compose... he can do anything, and he plays the piano! He's so cool! Tian was too shy to confess his love for Sue. Soon... the winter break was over. I'm leaving! Bye-bye! Bye-bye! Will you come back next year? I don't know. Perhaps Sue really loved this place. She came back to the motel the next year. Tian. What's with the piano? It's broken, no one wants it. So I put it here. I'm leaving! Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Did he play the song for you? What? Who? Tian! He asked me for the piano and made me teach him how to play Michael Lau's song. It took him a year to learn. Didn't you make a film about car racing that year? What was the name? You rode a motorbike... THE SUNSET. Yes, that one. Tian was tortured by that... More... Step on the pedal! Get up! That moron has no talent, just persistence. I'm leaving. Bye-bye. I'll go back to Hong Kong after graduation. This is my last winter break here. Do you have something to tell me? Bye-bye. I think I lost something... What is it? Have you checked your room? Are these yours? Do you know how to ride a motorbike? Why would you collect these? Bought them from the net. Are you a fan? I bought them for you. Then why didn't you give them to me? Let's go chase the sunset. You look a bit like Michael. I like you too. Are you hurt? The song you learnt last year, when will you play it for me? What a pity. Soon after they got married, Tian disappeared. Grandpa and Grandma! My brother chased a squirrel into the forest. -Xiao Liang! -Grandpa! -Xiao Liang! -Grandpa! Don't go in there, it's too dangerous. I know the area, I'll look for him. Wait here. Honey, let me go with you. Stay here and wait for the police Liang couldn't have gone too far. I'll be fine! Wait here. I promise, I'll be back. Xiao Liang Wait here. Xiao Liang Xiao Liang Xiao Liang One year later, the rescue team found Xiao Liang's body. but... they never found Tian. Don't worry. I'm sober this time. They are beautiful. Are they yours? Did you study Fine Arts? Yes, in Beijing. You have the gift, why didn't you pursue it? Managing this motel has already taken up all my time. Remember my new song? It's called "Missing Notes". I was inspired by your piano. I tried to write a song without "Do", "Re", "Mi", but I failed. Ironically, these notes keep popping up in my head. Now the song is mainly "Do", "Re", "Mi". Such is life. We hold dearly to things we lost, until we corner ourselves. I can un-fix your piano if you like. But without "Do", "Re", "Mi", it's no longer a piano. Are you sure this is what you want? Hold me tight! "My Husband's Glasses" Honey? Honey, I've been dead for a long time. Forget about me. At first I was worried about you, not sure how you'd get on without me. Whenever I see you thinking of me and cry in hiding, it breaks my heart. I don't want to see you like this. Let me go. I really must go. Honey! "Keep going." Goodbye, my love. I really love making movies. I guess it's time for me to go back. Are you Michael? Is that really you? Can we take a picture with you? We're your biggest fans. Let's take a picture. May I have your autograph? I wonder if 033 would visit me in Hong Kong. I realize I have fallen in love with 033. 033, let me take care you from now on. Michael... Let's go! Run, Michael! Run. No pictures... No pictures... Hurry... Get in! The paparazzi are here! Drive! Idiot! Run! Thank you for coming. I came back from Shangrila 2 days ago. I wish to... thank all my fans and friends of the media. I'm sorry you had to worry about me. I would also like to apologize... to all my working partners. I'm sorry. In the days ahead, I will do my best... to make up for lost time. Thank you. Michael... Yuan Yuan is getting married. Do you hate her? Sorry, no Q&A today. Say a few words, Michael... Absolutely not! I don't hate her; I only wish her the best. While you were away, did you meet someone? Michael, please say a few words... 033 033? 033? "Keep going." Ready? Camera! Action! Good! I'm sorry. Let's try it again. Hong, come here. Again. Can you see that girl in the grey outfit? Ask her to wait for me in the tent. Sure. Excuse me, Miss. You can't be here. Please wait over there. I'm sorry, she's Michael's friend. Miss, Michael invites you to wait for him over there. -Thank you. -Follow me. Come on... All right... Ready? Pull him up... Slowly! Pull him up... She's Michael's friend. -Have a seat. I still have work to do. -Sit down. You are 033? You're together now? Have you... No? Ready... Camera! Action! Cut! I'm glad you're here. Where are you staying? Kong Sing Hotel. What's your room number? I'm fully booked through tomorrow... right? Then I fly to Taiwan and come back the day after tomorrow. All right... Can you wait?

I will find my way out. I know I will! Please... let me out. Excuse me. Where's the reporting room? Over there. Thanks. It's OK. I'm here. I can't go with you. Please leave. Give me a chance. They found my husband's body. He was only 500m from getting out. Just 500m! He tried for 7 years... until last year. He was holding this when he died. We can never be together. Sue. Check out for me and go home. How about your things? You don't want them? -And the posters... -I don't want them. I must go, take care. 033? -Wait... your card! -Sue, you left your membership card. I don't want it. Fry the veggies first. Hurry up! I don't have an extra hand. Just hurry. Honey... You... The script of "Romancing into thin air" Directed and Written by Michael Lau You wrote the script? You plan to direct it? Yes. You're so talented. Have some tea. Sure! "And with one final breath, the life passed from Tian's emancipated form..." I love the script. But does the ending have to be so sad? It's a true story... No film... Cut. Good take? Everyone, stay where you are. Good! Great! This take is done. Go change! Thanks! Props! Bring the skeleton over here. Hurry up! Props, get out! Enoughget the snow machine! Make snow... No film... Michael, why do you want to direct "Romancing Into Thin Air"? Because nobody knows the story better. It's my personal experience. What is your expectation of this movie? I hope a friend of mine will like it. I'm curious. You're busy enough and this is your story... "Romancing into thin air" Xiao Liang! Grandpa Xiao Liang... Grandpa, don't go in there. I know the area better. Let me look for him. Honey, I'll go with you. You better stay and wait for the cops. He couldn't have gone too far. I'll find him. It'll be all right. Don't worry. I'll be back. "7 years later" I will survive this winter. I lasted this long. I'm sure I will get out. I know I will. Check out Sue Sue They found Tian? Get in the car! "Patient, Yang Xiaotian" Excuse me. Where is Yang Xiaotian? He's having a check-up. Thank you. "Dedicated to 033" Welcome to Deep Forrest... Sue! Sue! Sue! Sue! We missed you, Sue. So much...
