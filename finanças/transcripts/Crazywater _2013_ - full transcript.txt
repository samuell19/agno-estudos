[blows goose honk] Good job. [toots goose call] Holy man! Honkers coming in! Coming in low! [Dennis]: Our kids are four and six years old, and by taking them out here, I expose them to some of the traditions that kept us strong, and maybe even freedom from some of our past burdens. [♪♪♪] I was born in Inuvik. Where we grew up was called Co-op Hill. About half of the kids came from homes where there was alcohol abuse, and the other half didn't. [school bell rings] We saw a lot of drinking. When I look back on it, it was staggering. People were drinking hairspray, they were drinking solvents. The drinking got totally out of control. It was almost like wildfire, and I can understand it, too, because I'm an alcoholic. When I drink, I can't stop. I either drink till I pass out, or I drink till there's nothing left, and I can't find any more in town or anywhere, and only then, and only then will I stop. [neon buzz droning] The first time I drank, it was the summer going into Grade Seven, going into high school. There was a, um, a group home, a receiving home, we used to call them, just down the hill from our house, right next door, basically, and there was all kids that were in care. They all stayed inside this little house. And one of the boys went, and he broke into a warehouse, and he stole a case of church wine. [chuckles] And, uh, me and my little friend were riding our bicycles, our little banana bikes, we were riding around, and this guy said, "Hey, you want a drink?" and we just dropped our bicycles right there, right on the road. I was so excited, and we started mixing it with pop. I remember we mixed it with Coke, and we were drinking it, and I remember right away I started getting that really warm feeling, getting that buzz from the alcohol... and I just remember that feeling of, "Holy shit, man. "This is what it is. This is what they're after." It was magic. It was such a wonderful feeling, and from that day on, I believe that's when I became alcoholic. [birds calling] I'd just been sober maybe a year or two, and I was looking for anything to help me get some sanity back. Somehow I came across the book "Crazywater." It was our story told by us, basically. It was the first time I heard other Native people talk, like, candidly and openly about their drinking. Finally feeling like someone knew what the heck I was going through, let alone other Native people in Canada. You know what, Brian? I had no idea what to do other than string myself up, until someone handed me your book. I think it was one guy's story about how he was grieving, grieving his loss. That was the first time, the first time I, uh, I ever heard of anybody talking about alcoholism. [Brian]: I knew that the story of Native people and alcohol was one that touches all of our people, and I thought that if I could come up with a... a way of dealing with that in print, it would leave something lasting that would probably, hopefully, contribute to solutions. [Dennis]: It's no secret that we have trouble with alcohol and drugs. You know, all you've got to do is just, you know, go and look out down in the inner cities and on the reserves, and, you know, you'll see there's... there's still a lot of alcohol and drug abuse in our communities. I want to get people to start talking about our own denial about our own alcoholism. How can anybody understand us if we don't tell our story? [Alex]: This fringe is going to go on my apron. I made this apron, I don't know, about six months ago. Hobiyee is the highlight of the year. It allows nations to get together and to show a tiny portion of our culture to those who come out and witness such an event. I was at two residential schools, Port Alberni and Alert Bay, for two years. [sewing machine whirring] People have reasons why they drink, maybe a loss of job, or loss of family, right? But for me, it was the abuse that I went through. That's why I drink. And I'll never forget the first drunk. It was a punch. I didn't know what people were telling me, to just have a-- have a cup, so I drank it. It just kicked in... [snaps fingers] it kicked in right away. I got really high, drunk, and then I remember standing behind this door, the front door, and people were coming in, I'm standing right in there, it's like I'm locked in behind this door, and it's... and then after that, I don't remember nothing. [♪♪♪] [distant sirens wail] [Paula]: My grandmother drank all the time, and then the partying lifestyle was handed down. I inherited all the sexual abuse and all of the violence. I was thrust into a torturous lifestyle by the age of three. I'm just grateful that I have the courage to stop. I had been shooting up in Edmonton since I was 11. I think I was 28 years old, and this is the corner that I first came to when I came to Vancouver... where I, more or less, claimed as mine. I ended up staying here for a long time. Back then, I was only on 100, $100 in welfare, and that'd only last me an hour. I had a very high addiction. I probably went through about 500, easy, a day. [Stephen]: I grew up in white society. Because my stepfather was in a residential school, we were raised that we weren't Indian, that we were white. My mom drank, my stepfather drank, grandfather drank, my aunts and uncles all drank, so it was around me continuously. I started drinking at the age of eight, and got into the harder drugs when I was 14. But I've been clean off the drugs now for about nine years. It's just the alcohol I'm trying to kick. With the alcohol, I always get myself in trouble. It's like a saying I always have, you know, I'm allergic to alcohol, you know. Every time I drink alcohol, I break out in handcuffs. [chuckling] You know, which is totally true in my case. [Dennis]: There's such a stigma about being a Native person... and alcohol. Where, like, that's our racial profile is we're fucking drunks, and it's kind of a well-deserved moniker, too, because for the most part, we have been. [chuckles ruefully] We, you know through our history, we've always struggled with alcohol, so there's a lot of shame and a lot of guilt around being Native. You know, you have to have pretty good self-esteem to overcome that, uh, stereotype. [Alex]: I just kept on going. Drink, drink, drink, that's all I do. That's all I wanted to do. All the anger that-- that I had towards the group homes, the residential school, it all just, I let it all go. The last straw was with the police, and they said I'm under arrest, and I said, "What's going on?" then after a while they told me, they said, "Well, we're charging you for armed robbery," and I said, "What?" They said, "The people at the hotel identified you. You were in there, accomplice to a robbery." I told them over and over and over that I didn't do this, I didn't do this armed robbery, but I got... pinned for it. I did my time in Peace River Correctional Centre. There was 95% Natives in that jail. After I got out, I just left it all behind, and I continued on my journey of hate towards white people, the cops, the government, everybody. [Stephen]: You know, I can understand the point of the courts giving me a nine o'clock curfew. It's just for the safety of the public, because nine out of 10 times, I get released from jail, and I end up back in jail the same day. So... I have to stay here for a couple of months till I get some programming behind me, some treatment behind me. It's either here or jail. I mean, it's not the type of life I'd wish for anybody, you know, but for some people, they need it. For me, I need it. You know, because I know where I'd be right now. You know, I probably would be on the streets, drinking. This one I did when I was 15. I was all messed up on cocaine, and, uh, you know, my arms were bare at the time. I figured I'd do a tattoo on myself. This one here, I did this when I was 16, um... 16 or 17, and it represents confusion. This one I did when I was... did some time in the hole when I was doing federal, and this is made from a staple and burnt paper and water, so... All my tattoos have a tale of some sort, so... My life story. Being in jail, it changes you. You sleep with one eye open because you don't know who's going to come into your cell. You know, it's a dangerous life. You know, you've got to deal with all sorts of people, you know, from sexual predators to murderers. Guys who don't give a rat's ass who you are, you know? They're all out for themselves. I became part of a crew when I was young. 16 years old, part of a gang, just 'cause I needed the protection. 'Cause I'm young, in a big jail, lots of big guys around me, and I'm the little guy. You know, you watch it on TV, and, you know, it looks so glamorous, it looks so good, you know, but it's not, because once you're in, you're in. [Dennis]: So when we moved into Inuvik, when alcohol became readily available where you could actually go to the liquor store and buy alcohol without kind of any legal implications, a lot of my dad's generation really... their alcoholism really took off. It used to really kind of give me a lot of anxiety coming back here. My whole past kind of happened on these streets right here, right along this road here. This is where my ghosts are, right? [school bell rings] There was a lot of joy. Of course there was a lot of joy, you know? Growing up in Inuvik was, it was a fun place, but there was a lot of... a lot of hurt, too, eh? A lot of really dark, dark times that I went through here. I was so absorbed by all the dysfunction, and all the shit that was going around me, I couldn't learn. None of us could learn. I quit school. I turned 17. My mom said, "You're 17 now. You got to work. You got to go get a job somewhere. I don't care." Oil industry was going on. Some of my older friends were working, they'd coming to town with lots of money, big cheques, man. I started phoning around the oil companies, and I got a job. So 17 years old, I come back to town, I got my cheque. I'm a man now. What do we do? We drink from Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and we drink and laugh, drink and laugh. Sunday we're all broke. [laughs] Flat broke Sunday! Somehow, we scrape up enough to get a bottle, and we're in someone's house, and we're sitting there, and the depression sets in on Sunday, when we run out of money. Good morning. Hey! What's up? Hanging out? Yeah. Remember fucking going out to work, and then coming back with thousands of dollars in the bank and just pissing it all away? -Yeah. -Then going back to work. And then going back to work, and then coming back, and then-- Over and over. Then E.I. kicks in, or your pogey kicks in, and you sit in the fucking bar all winter long. We did that for, what, 14 years? 15 years? When Esso was up here, when oil companies were here. Yeah. Then they all left and just... left you with nothing. But still, even when you had nothing, you could still go out and get fucking loaded, too, right? Oh, again, it's the brotherhood. Yeah. Who's got the money pays, and then when you got no money, then somebody else takes over. It just, it just, just circles. Yeah, for sure, man. People can get drunk day, after day, after day. Lots of them get out of it, but lots of them don't. [crows caw] [Desirae]: Ever since I was a little girl, I was... I was very quiet. I always kept to myself. We're going to get ready to go to the park. Oh, okay. And I was always with my grandmother, my kokum. My mom was in and out of the picture a lot of the time, but I used to always miss her, and I needed to be with her, and... I always longed for that. I don't know too much of the story then, and I can't remember a lot-- is that my grandmother couldn't look after me, my kokum, because she didn't have the funds or the means, and she was in school, so she, um... she ended up putting me in care. My foster brother, or so-called it, sexually abused me, and... My social worker that was in my life used to come and see me, and she'd say, "You're here for a reason, you know? Your family doesn't want you," you know, and really drilling these things into my mind as a four or five year old, you know, and I was totally... totally just felt outcasted, you know, and I was like, "Why? Why would they put me here? And why did my mother leave me," you know? I started running away at 11 years old. At 13, I was doing weed and alcohol, and it was normal to me. It was something that wasn't too hardcore because I had lived with my mom who was very addicted to crack, and all those different harder drugs, so me doing something lightly was like, "Oh, it's not that bad. I'm just drinking and smoking weed." [Dennis]: Well, my dad, he was a good guy, but he drank a lot, and when he wouldn't come home for basically days at a time, I would go looking for him, and I remember standing outside, wanting him to come home, and what can you do when you're a little kid, six, seven years old? What can you do but cry? I wanted him to come home so bad, but he wouldn't come, and that's alcoholism, man. You just... Nothing matters, I guess. [Desirae]: Like, I came out of my blackout one time, and there was blood all over, and this big gash on my head, and someone had bottled me out. My ex was crying, and I woke up, and I was like, "Why are you crying?" and then I got to look in the mirror, and I was like, "Oh," and all I did was just tie a rag around my head, and just kept on drinking. [eagle cries] [Stephen]: You know, if I was feeling sad, I drank. If I was mad, I drank. If I was depressed, I drank. Um, if I was lonely, I drank. You know, now I'm dealing with all these emotions and feelings that I've never dealt with before, and it's hard. Merry Christmas, everyone! [hum of bustling crowd] [Dennis]: I remember Christmases were especially hard for us, because that was usually the time that he would go on a big bender, and it would last for days and days. I remember my mother throwing him out because he couldn't sober up, and I remember him losing jobs because he couldn't sober up. I never really... got to spend much time with him, and I think that's kind of where my resentment towards him grew. Every Christmas, they would have a Christmas party for the kids. We got into the gymnasium, and it was just full of families. I think we might have been the only Native kids there, and by that time too, I'd already made assumptions about Native people. Santa called all the names of all the kids, and all the kids went up, and we were waiting, and waiting, and waiting... and he never called our names. We found out later that it was the parents that were supposed to bring, uh, bring the gifts there. What does that do to a kid, eight, nine years old? I felt like it shut the door on my... on my worth as a human being or whatever. [Desirae]: But I loved my mom so dearly. I wanted to be close to her. And the only way to be close to somebody is to live in the lifestyle. That's the closest you're going to get, right? I got pregnant, and I said, "I've got to clean up. I've got to not do any weed or anything," and I had my son, Darius, at 16, and I lasted about nine months. Through those nine months, I had fallen off and started to use heavier drugs like ecstasy. I went to a battered women's shelter, and in that shelter I was like, "I'm done with breastfeeding. I need to go get drunk." [chuckles] You know? And the day-- the day I went to go put my son on formula was the day I walked into the liquor store with my two kids, my two-month-old and my three-year-old, and I took them to the park, and I just sat there, and I drank, you know, all by myself. [Paula]: I have three children, and I was so spiritually hurt from getting molested that, um, I couldn't be a parent. I loved my children with my heart, but I didn't love myself. [voice breaking] I was shooting up with my son and my oldest daughter. She witnessed me doing... pulling tricks, and, uh, my son and my other daughter used to keep six while I did drugs, and when they were five years old, they got taken away. The more I hurt for the kids, the more I used drugs, which is the cycle, I think, of a lot of mothers that have children in foster care. And the tears that I cry is because I missed watching them grow up. [Alex]: It's been... 14 years, possibly? Maybe 15 years since I saw my son. When my son was born, I was-- I was so happy. I was just so relieved. The mom made sure that I didn't go anywheres, because she knew I drank a lot. I stayed in the hospital with her until probably close to midnight. She wanted to make sure that the bars, or the liquor store was closed, because I was really edgy and excited because I wanted to go and celebrate. Getting ready to go out to the whale camp. The whale camp has been a big part of my... big part of my life, so I just want to bring my kids down there. Here. I got a big box of donuts, and buns, and bread. Okay, right on. What is it? Gold. That's what we call donuts and bannock and bread. Lots of work. It's just like gold. [Dennis]: For me to make any change, I have to hit a wall, and most alcoholics are like that. You have to hit a wall, and you have to have a gun to your head, and somebody has to cock that barrel and say, "You gotta make change now." When we had our children, I hadn't found true recovery yet, I hadn't really conceived a higher power yet, and I knew if I didn't get help, that I was going to curse my children with my disease, because I was cursed with this disease. Jennifer, she said, "You've got to change, or you're going to lose your family." [♪♪♪] When I have anxiety, and when I'm feeling kind of out of sorts, it kind of rubs off on my-- on my children, especially on my son, because he's really sensitive too. I try to talk to him about his feelings, and I tell him, "Hey, Hayden, I know you're going through some anxiety, and I know-- I know you're going through being shy," he always talks about being shy, and I tell him, "I know what it's like to be shy 'cause Dad is shy too." I guess the best memories I have of my dad was when we would go out hunting, because I knew that when we went out hunting, I would have all his attention, and I wouldn't have to deal with-- with his drinking. I remember the first time he let me harpoon a whale. It was just out here, as a matter of fact, with my cousin Larry Semmier, and my other cousin, Ebun. Larry was driving the kicker, and Ebun was sitting in the middle trying to roll a smoke, and I was harpooning, and my dad was in the-- in the middle somewhere just telling us what to do, telling Larry how to follow the whale. I'm there with the harpoon, and my dad said, "As soon as the whale comes up, as soon as you see it, throw the harpoon." That whale came up like that, and I threw my harpoon, and it stuck in there, and he said, "Throw your float out. Throw your jerry can." I threw it out, and pretty soon that whale took off, and I was bobbing away in the water with a big 22-foot canoe, and I didn't know how the hell I fluked it in one shot. Boom! Killed it, and it was stone dead, and holy man, you would have thought I won an Academy Award or something... [laughs] the way he was praising us up. He just couldn't stop telling everybody I got it with one shot, so... That was pretty good, man. When you're a kid like that, it's... and your dad gives you that kind of praise, it's... there's nothing better than that. Hayden, come on, we're going to go pull up the whale. Nice and easy. [Dennis]: In our addictions, we stray from the important things in life, which is family and faith. By giving your children opportunity to come out on the land, you're giving them a connection to their family, and you're giving them a connection to their faith... See all these marks right there? When they're swimming under the ice, sometimes by mistake, by accident, they get scraped up on the ice. It's a female. Yeah. Boy, nice muktuk. This one, you could make a strip. [Dennis]: I bring my kids out to Baby Island because I want them to know that they have a place on this earth. To me, this is where they belong. [kids chat and play] Darius had seen me and my addiction before I even had my son, so when he was three and a half, like, he remembers these things. He's very smart. That day when they got apprehended, I remember them sitting in the van, and I was crying, and I was hyperventilating, and my younger son was crying, and Darius looked at me, and he said, "Don't worry, Mom. I'm going to take care of my brother." And that was the day I made the decision. You know, I made a decision that no matter what was going to come in my path, I was going to pull up my socks and get walking, you know? That I wasn't going to blame anybody anymore for my past. [ball clanks against bat] [embers crackling] So it's... Just wash your eyes, and wash your ears. Wash your mouth so you speak the truth, your nose so you smell good things, your heart so you feel good things. That's what we do with the smudge. It's a big part of my recoveries. Yeah. [Paula]: I got to a point where I couldn't take it anymore because I was getting beat up. I was owned. I asked the creator to get rid of my resentments, help me with my fears, and protect me from myself, because it's me who chooses these things without even thinking it's my choice. [Alex]: This is my first blanket I've made. This is for my son, for his grad, because this is the first one, so I have to give it away, and I'm giving it to him. My son doesn't know my past, but I want him to understand where his dad was. I sort of told him why he was taken away, but I never really elaborated more, but I feel he needs to know. I want my son to have what I didn't have growing up. But when I was working, it was so hot. Yeah. It was, like, I don't know, mid-30s. I used to walk by this place, and knew I was going to come-- I was going to be living in this building here. Oh. So, what was the addiction like? Like, what was your constant feeling? The constant feeling was being high. Easing the pain. High on, uh, alcohol, drugs. Meth? I did meth, but not as often as... I did it for maybe a month, you know? This is the old U Gym right here, where I used to go. What was that program like? The program was to help me stop my addiction of drugs and alcohol, to um... more or less give myself a second chance in life. [gulls cry] And, you know, I do apologize for not being around. It's just the way things happened. Some people said it was selfish of me to move away... because I did lose focus on my life. I gave up on myself. And it was hard for me, because I didn't know how to be a father to you. All those years I've been in care... I thought it was pretty bad. I didn't like it, but it was... I dealt with it somehow. Me, my sister and my brother, we all moved. We were in the same foster home, right? And they got to see their dad, but I was the only one that was left out because, yeah, you weren't-- you weren't there. [♪♪♪] [Dennis]: My dad was, uh... He knew that I was angry at him because of the way I treated him. He continued to drink until he died. He never did sober up. This was his favourite hat, I guess. He liked shiny stuff, eh? I imagine this hat was pretty white at one time. He died in a drowning accident. I lost, uh, I lost three members of my family. This is my sister, Dalma, her daughter, Asta, and my dad. They all perished on the same day in a boating accident in July of 2008. They were on their way down to whale camp. [Dennis]: We got a phone call saying that they're missing. We built a search camp, and we started dragging the river, and I just remember that whole time... [voice shaking] wanting to, uh, talk to him, wanting to apologize to him, maybe? Um... and a few times I found myself talking to him when I was dragging the river. I wanted to... apologize to him, I guess, for the way I treated him, and, uh... I wanted to have that conversation that I never did have with him. [singing softly] ♪ Jesus ♪ In a holy rage... [Dennis]: And, uh... I had that conversation with him, and I believe he heard me. [♪♪♪] This is where our family was. This is our kind of family retreat, so after my dad died, it just didn't feel the same anymore, so we just stayed away. In sobriety, I've learned to reconcile the past and come to terms with it. I have to accept it. And as a family, we decided that in order to do this, we need to purge all the old junk that he's been collecting over the years, and just burn it and get rid of it. We're trying to let my dad go, too, you know? Are we doing waters? There is juices there. Okay, I'll pour some juice too, then. [Paula]: I've been volunteering for the City of Vancouver for three years in a woman's clinic. I do volunteer so much that... I think it's... it's what keeps me sober. UGMs offers a really big meal for the women. Some of them, this is the only meal that they get on the street. It's a community of respect and love down here. I think it's important for everybody to realize there's a way out, because we all know there's a way in. Mm-hm. Hardly any of us know the way out. So it's all about in here, your prayer in here, what you mean in here, because if you're ready, then the universe is ready. [everyone chatting together] You quit everything, like even smoking cigarettes? -Yeah. -Everything? I quit everything, even men. [laughs] That's no good! That's no good for your health at all! [laughing] [Paula]: Recovery is not only recovering about us, but recovering as a community. We don't feel we belong anywhere, and we're such community-based, nomadic people, it breaks all our hearts, right? And that's a part that keeps us addicted, too, is at least when we're using drugs and alcohol, we're in a bar room full of other Indians who are into drugs and alcohol, so that keeps us all connected in a really dysfunctional way. You have to ask yourself, "Am I done?" Am I done hurting people? Am I done hurting myself? Am I done hurting the world? Yeah. Am I done blaming the world? Yeah, there you go. Yeah. Am I done carrying this baggage that goes back two blocks? Yeah, yeah. Am I ready to let it down and let it go? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's like these cars that are driving by, how many years I let drive by me on this corner. [Desirae]: I know when I'm, like, really stressed out I should make an art piece or something, because I find that's where my peace is at... but I've never been taught. I've just kind of done it off the top of my head. I'm making a painting of a mommy and a baby. The mommies and then the baby. Do you see it? [Desirae]: I decided that I wanted to make a painting for my mom. I think for me and my mom, like, our relationship is just now growing into, like, a mother-daughter relationship, and she's now there for my children, which is really cool, and I think it'll just represent a lot, like, for her to be able to recognize that she is a mom and that she's doing good, and-- Lookit, Mommy! Ooh.. [laughing fondly] And your blue nose. [laughing] There's going to be a lot of healing, I feel, in the next few years with my family, but a lot of work. What dancer is he? He's a fancy dancer. Fancy... [Desirae]: When I think about breaking the cycles with my children, I'm breaking cycles within my nation, and that's what gives me strength. [telephone rings] [Stephen]: Hey, this is Steve Wolf calling in. [Dennis]: What happened? How did you end up back in there? [Stephen]: On the beginning of September there, I lost a really good friend of mine, and took it a little hard. Thought I could handle having one beer, but it ended up being a whole bunch more later, and I went on the run, and then they caught me two weeks later, and I got charged for not complying with my probation order, my bail-- bail order, so I'm, uh, really anxious, I'm worried, because I don't know how many times I've gotten out of jail, and, you know, just want to do good, but then there's always that little bit of a bump in the road that makes me kind of swerve. You know, it's, uh... it's really hard. [Dennis]: All of us guys and women who've sobered up, we all know what it's like to have no control over it. We all know what it's like to slip, and we all know what it's like when someone dies or something bad happens, and... and, uh, you know we... it's almost like we have no defence against that first drink. When I quit drinking, I... I tried to do it alone, but, man, inside I was just, like, just torn up, you know? It wasn't until I started reaching out and asking for help, talking to other people. It made it easier. [Stephen]: Oh yeah. Yeah. So... Scary, I guess. You know, I've been doing this 20 years now, coming in and out, in and out, and, you know, like, I've had enough. [Dennis]: You don't belong in there. Don't give up, and, you know, you don't have to do it alone. We're rooting for you, man. We're on your team. [Dennis]: I know what we could do. You guys want to try a harpoon throw? You guys got to get ready for whaling, you know. You got to learn how to throw a harpoon. Okay, Hayden, harpoon him good! Oh, yeah! You just missed him. You guys, that's the whale right there. Try this one. [Dennis]: My higher power is the love that you have for me, and the love that I have for you, and the love that we have for one another. Okay, watch Lucas first. Oh, just about! [Dennis]: For the longest time, I didn't know what the hell to believe in. I didn't believe that there was something that was greater than me, I guess. Here's your harpoons. Good whalers, boys! Good hunters! Oh, right on, Hayden! You're ready to go whaling. [Dennis]: The care and concern that we have for one another, that's what I call "god," and I had to make it as simple as that. Alcohol and drugs wasn't my problem. All my life, I got told that it was my problem, but it was my solution. The problem was me. I was just spiritually unfit to live in my own skin. That's what's happening with our people, I think. All people who are suffering from... from addictions are suffering from being spiritually sick. And our culture, it teaches us how to love ourselves. I need to pick up the tools and be the matriarch of my family. Like, I'm coming up as the grandmother and the mother, and I can't do that while smoking drugs or doing alcohol. [Desirae]: As a Native woman, I can stand as strong as I am today, right? I can have the backbone that I need, not only for my own people, but for my kids, for my family, for my mom. Look who it is! How are you? Give a hug. Give Kokum a hug. Now I can play. Now you can play, yeah. Hi, my girl. How are you? [Desirae]: I am really happy that me and my mom cleaned up around the same time, because I get to walk with her. Give me a hug. Aw... What are you doing? [Desirae]: I've always looked at... Like, our relationship is more like sisters, really than it has ever really been mother and daughter. I'm trying to build something. I'm going to build a house. [Desirae]: But I'm grateful that she's there for my kids, and she can help me with my kids, because that's where I need help now. [Paula]: We'll do it all together. A family project, okay? I want a... I want a robot. You want a robot now? Okay, so he should have two like that. See? Where's the bend? Now we need to make a head, see? You got any more straws for a head? With all the mistakes that I've done in my life, I don't want to repeat it, and so I try sometimes too hard. Go get me a yellow straw. I'll make a better head. [Desirae]: It is really tough for me to always be respectful, 'cause I did a lot of growing on my own, but now she can show that love to my children, which is what I'm extremely grateful for that they actually have a grandma, and I'm learning now the walls that I put up, and what I need to take down, and to be more gentle and kind. Look, Mom, I made you something. Cool. Awesome. [Paula]: Me and my daughter have done a lot of work on ourselves. Mother and daughter. My Pumpkin. The baby... [Paula]: I think because we did that, we got to work on our hearts and healing. Yeah, see all the yellow? New beginnings for us. I hope that Creator keeps us clean for the rest of our lives, and then somewhere, maybe 10 years down the road, we're going to have a really healthy relationship, but right now, it's still in its infant stage. We're still learning how to walk with it. You know, when her kids get to be teenagers, and my other grandchildren get to be teenagers, they're going to see a sober grandma. They're going to see a kokum that loves to go pow-wow. [Desirae]: This year, we're all going to be three generations dancing the Sun Dance together. It's pretty exciting to... to be able to go back to that, and just also make my grandmother proud that I'm starting to take on the ways that she walked. [Alex]: The culture-- because I never thought I would ever have that, I thought I'd lost it-- just like it was drilled out of us back in the day. Elders and our leader talk about it's good to make our own regalia. One of the things I really worked on are these. These are... I made, like, six sets of leggings. It's the wolf. This goes... goes on there. But I will eventually add some buttons. The more buttons you have is the sign of wealth for the ts'amiks and the matriarchs. [Paula]: My mom, she gave me everything. All the beadwork she did herself. Traditionally, we don't show any part of our body, so I'm covered from my toes, all the way to my arms, all the way to my neck. Boy, that's really nice. And that's to show respect for my body. When we go pow-wow dancing, a lot of people don't realize we're in prayer. It's not to put on a show, it's to be connected to that centre pole, and to dance for the people who are on the outside. We're dancing for the whole world to be better. [drums beat steadily] [singers begin low] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, from the Nisga'a Nation... [singing and drumming together] [distant cheers] [Alex]: Being part of the community, being involved in everything, it's really important to me because it is my identity, finding who I am. I believe that we all have that little light in our heart. It may be dim, but it's not burnt out. It's there. And once you start believing, it gets brighter.
