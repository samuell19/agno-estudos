* BUCK AND THE PREACHER * "The Civil War was over anda by law the slaves were freed. "But when the promise of land freedom was not honored, many ex-slaves journeyed out of the land of bondage in search of new frontiers where they could be free at last. "They placed their hopes in the hands of the few black wagonmasters that knew the territories of the West". None of this came easy, to overcome a hostile wilderness, but nightriders and bounty hunters were hired by by "persons unknown" to hunt them down and turn them back to the fields. This picture is dedicated to those man, women and children who lie in graves as unmarked as their place in history. The 1000 acres, from this tree to the river, are yours. Here you have it, put it away. Do you want to stay a while? We would like that very much. Thank you. Very lucky. Now you will hear me. You come from Louisiana, right? Well, then you have to harvest the cotton and plant sugar cane. Good jobs for the people, who are with you. Born there, you will die there This site is not for you. You couldn't stand a winter. There is nothing for you! No farms, no cattle, nothing! You must come back. I'ts understood? Hey you. Come here. Where's Buck? I am looking for the head of the expedition, a certain Buck. I dont know. We don't know any Buck. He brought you here, didn't he? Well, where is he? Where did you hide it? Where is he? The man who brought us was not called that. I do not know him. I will find this Buck. Be careful. Now do as I say. Get out and wave to that man. If you try to deceive me, I will destroy everything here. Understood By horse. Floyd! Fast! Hey, what do you want! I need your horse I understand. I give you 20 dollars. It's a good price. But I don't sell horses, brother. I Have hurry. Believe me, I wish I could help you, but... Don't make me accept. How to get? Quiet. I can't put on, my pants? Or do you need them too? I just wanted to get my boots. You are eating my rabbit! What are you doing here? Dressing me up, don't you see? You will accept? Take off those clothes. Wait, bro! Remove! You forgot coffee! There are two mountains, pointing to the sky. Beyond, a green valley with lots of clean water. I can see him. He's there and his name is Colorado. You must not go back. But, this valley will be our home. Let's move on. Very well. Thieves attacked people here two weeks ago. Then they set a train on fire, believing I was getting on. This way. Then they went to Smith Country, on the banks of Clayton Pond. Now they come here. You have to go tonight. Hey boy. Can you bring me a bottle of whiskey? Why don't you come in and have it? Face... Good whiskey should be drunk outdoors. Anyway, my heart longs to find, my race brothers. Where are the blacks? Where you live? With my mother, at Mr. Logan's. 10 miles from here. Do people of color live there? No, we are passing through. We do the harvest. Toby! Toby! Whiskey, son. 40 cents, the bottle and the money. How did you get that, horse? So? I met him by the river. And where is the man, who was riding him? I dont know. Tell me, don't you know? One comes and goes and the desert erases the tracks. Only God can know. I'm not in the mood for jokes. There is no one here. Where's Buck? Buck, is that his name? Where is it? Sir! I am looking for that miserable bastard who is also a sinner. When I find him, he'll find out who I am. How did you get that horse? I told you, on the river. That bastard stole mine. It's a lie! As if God were my judge. I swear on the Bible! Why are you here? Same as you: fighting sin. Following the Lord's way. I heard, we'll have to find Buck. We have to find him. If you see him, tell us where he is. There is a $ 500 reward for you. Will you remember well? 500 dollars. This looks great. Hmm!... And how do you prefer it, alive or dead? Whatever! And if you look for it, I find it, tell me, How can I find you? In Copper Springs. Ask for Deshay. Deshay, Mr. Deshay. He is a preacher, who is spreading, the word of the Lord, to the people in these places? Yes sir. The need to hear the sacred word is the same for everyone. The best advice you can give them is to come back... and come home. Yes sir, turn around and go home. Hey boy! What a beautiful afternoon? Yes sir. Are you coming home No snhor, I sleep at the bar. Oh! The harvest is over and we?ll eat roast pork and chicken. That's nice. Who is your preacher? We have none. And who thanks the Lord? Uncle Cudjo, but he's more of a sorcerer than a preacher. I understand. Hey, do you want me to accompany you on horseback? I said on horseback. Who's coming with Toby? My blessings, in the name of the Lord. I?m Reverend Willis Oakes Rutherford, of the Holy Church, of Persuasion. Where are you from, reverend? Santo Lacard, Mississippi. Where you go? The Lord's green lands are vast And there's nowhere where I don't go with my mission Today I am here and tomorrow, there. Ah, where are you from? We are from Santa Ana Parish, Louisiana. Ah... My name is Kingston. Delighted, Brother Kingston. Well, well, preacher. Be welcome. They have come a long way. And we go even further. Ah, I am very happy to find a Christian congregation. Yes, if you allow me... After eating something, I would like to offer a prayer, because they are lucky to be in this wonderful land, created by the Lord. How did you find me? I asked your horse. Do not worry. What are you looking for? My horse. Among other things. Well, I got your horse. What are you doing around here? Spread the word of the Gospel. Are you a preacher? Yes. Reverend Willis Oakes Rutherford, of the Holy Church of Persuasion. Well, you can have dinner here, Reverend. We are at peace for the rabbit. Get some rest and then go. Buck ... 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 400, 410 and 420. Four mules and a pig stick. I hope you are happy. Yes, sir, everything is fine. If your people want to stay here and plant another crop, we can do the same deal. No, we had better go, but we are very grateful, sir. Very well. Come on. Come on. C'mon C'mon! Hayah! Oh, oh... Which path are you taking, preacher? The truth is, I haven't decided yet. You have three possibilities. Ah yes? East, North or South. And the West? Let?s go. Well, this is too big. If we agree, we won't get in the way. You have your horse back so don't be lucky. Tell me, Buck, what do you have against me? Nothing. How crazy to leave a weasel in a chicken coop. I know a man from the East, you are not good enough to work. I already said that I am not from the East, I am a preacher. Well, okay. I think I thought better of it, in the west. Goodbye, brothers. Hey. Hey. May the Lord be with you, amen. Hayah, hayah!... Today you must put double surveillance. Yes. I'll be back tomorrow at sunset, with the women! You will find the wells with the map. Yes, I've seen it. Indians! Buck, the Indians are coming! What the hell are you doing? Get off the horse. Did you see what's behind? Get down. Don't tell me you are going to pray. Preacher, don't lose your cool and keep your mouth shut. My God. Lord have mercy. If you don't stand still, they will kill you. Sinsie. Couples. Are you well? Yes. All right? More or less. What do you want, sergeant? A caravan is coming this way. 40 people not counting, children. What kind of people? Black. I want them to reach the sources safely, on the Pecos coast. You have five days to do this. Impossible, they have sick horses and old mules. Five days. It's ok. Ten dollars each. I thought there were six. Eight days! Eight. They have to live all winter and feed their children. Let's say children are not worth eight. Eight. Children, nothing. They will need food. I would kill three buffalo. A buffalo. My husband says that with two buffalo it is better. Thank you, Sinsie. Brother, you are good for everything. How do you get along with the Indians? Why do you follow me? Me? I'm lost. And I thank God, for finding you. If not, I would have died, like a coyote. Toby! Toby! My God. Carefully. Like this. Excuse! It's all over. Take it easy. Traed gave me water. The money is gone, my $ 14,000. How are we going to live all winter without food or seeds? We have nothing to do, we will have to go back. Ben, Susana, Tom Cooper. Joseph... Rachel's son, Toby. All dead. But the valley awaits us... green and cozy. It's there. We will continue. We have no provisions and no food. We will not be able to resist winter. We will die in the snow. No, you will not die in the snow. Do we move on? Yes. And what are we waiting for? We have no money to pay, what we owe you. Does not matter. You paid what is necessary to pass through the region of the Indians. You must cross the river, to the north. You have five days to do this. Let's meet up near the river, Ben. You have nothing to do here, boy. You can come or go, I don't care. Have you heard of Copper Springs and one called Deshay? I do not? I arrested your horse in the Frenchman's Ford. They asked me very strange questions. Now I know why. Copper Springs? I heard them say they were going there. I remember each of their faces. Deshay, wait a minute. What is it, Sheriff? I want to talk to you. Great. Floyd, bring me a brandy. I know that you attacked some caravans. We just had a chat with them. Now listen, what am I going to tell you. You cannot shoot or burn in this city as long as I enforce the law. And that goes for people of color and others. I came to get my mail and have fun, nothing more. It doesn't matter, I repeat. These people are free, to come and go, that is the law. Sheriff... are there any formal complaints against me and my men? Listen, we act in good faith when dealing with these people. I think we always behave well, in Louisiana We never gave reasons for people to speak ill of us. You know that very well, Sheriff. I don't care what you do, but this is not Louisiana. And now, be careful here. Are they. Deshay is the one wearing the hat. There are only eight. Yes, the other two are in the room. Do you want to fuck all eight at once? Five. Three of them are very busy up there. But they won't always be there, I know. I have to catch them off guard. Let me talk to them. Then you will take them by surprise. My blessings, for this house. I am the reverend, of the Holy Church of Persuasion. What the hell are you doing here? Do you remember that we met before, sir? It's the preacher. Yes brother. I run a serious home, not a gaming house like. Shut up. What you want? Good... do you remember who was interested for some unscrupulous trickster, a guy named Buck? Do you know where is it? They have eyes and don't see until they are opened! I'm not in the mood for jokes. Oh, I'm not kidding, sir. But, if I'm not mistaken, a value was mentioned, Ah, $ 500 to be exact. Where? Although it slides like a shadow, I will take up to 500 dollars. I'm not arguing with you. Tell us where he is. Are you interested in my money? Get him out of my house, I have to take care of my prestige. You are like that woman, Jezebel, who believed, to be a prophetess to teach and lead my servants to sin! Revelation, chapter two. Do you want to expel him from here? He's a preacher. You said that, brother! I'm preaching. And anyone who sins is against his own body. Corinthians one. It's you, Esther. It's you, Esther. Sin is the way, to ruin! What a desolation, what a terrible desolation. Shut up! Hey, reverend! You better not be distracted, I'm preaching. The poor man sins. However, there is time to sin. Come on! I'm Buck. I put my faith, in the Bible. Ah! There are no more than 100 dollars here! Here are 30. Ah!... Where's the money! Come on, say it! No!... Where is it?! Let's talk! Where is it? Come on, Buck, we have to go. Go ahead, preacher. Help us, Lord. Do you want to hurry up? What they?re trying, They know very well where I am going, they?ve been there before. 157 dollars. They spent drinking and they hid more than 1000 dollars. Just for the drink. They didn't even have my $ 500. Which 500 dollars? Those who were going to give me up, for giving up on you. Well, I'm here. And they are dead. Hayah! Yes. Buck, motherfucker!... It's ok? I went to aunt's house... Did they hurt you? They just hit me on the head. They hurt the people, from Parroquia de Santa Ana. They killed some and burned everything there. You can rest well. I have no time. I didn't know if you were still alive. I couldn't go back if they were waiting for me. I know I know. The horses are well tied. This is Ruth. And this is the preacher. Your servant, lady. Thank you, for me. Where can we get horses here? Aunt Pennybegger yes. It is very reliable. How many do you need? At least one for you. You come too. They were here and can come back. Are they still chasing you? Not all, some are dead. Eight to be exact. Are we going north? To Canada? It's not possible. Not yet. And why not? Where will we go? You did what you could in the country and you were shot. I'm not going to live here anymore, do you hear me? The war has not changed anyone. It is like a poison that has penetrated the depths. They give us nothing not a few pieces of land, or mules. Not even freedom. Yes, it is a poison, which has penetrated deep. The weather has changed you know. I don't want to spend my life doing other people's clothes. I want to live with you, Buck, I have a right to that. I want to have your children and educate them, somewhere where there is no slavery. I want to sew, do my homework and take care of my family, until God, give me strength. I want to go somewhere else with you, Buck. And I want to have your children, but I don't want to have them here. That's why I'm going, to another place. I don't know if they want us in Canada. But I will go to the end of the world and continue. The people of the Parroquia de Santa Ana... go there and have no food or seeds. And they will starve when winter comes. Buck, dear, you're just a man. But say my word. Go, spend it. I will find the horses. What is on your mind? Are you worried about the massacre? Do not. He had killed before. Now I confess, I don't know what to do. I think they'll get me. The leaders did not do so, with slavery nor the rebels during the war, however... I think... This will end up catching me. Is weird. When it gets dark. It seems that the hope of failing You will continue to fight, the best you can. It seems that there is no other way. I love you, Buck. Where did you get that gun? In Windsmith, Reverend. And where did you get that curious Bible? Well, it's an inheritance. Before the war, when I was a child, my mother and I were sold to a preacher. When he was drunk, he helped him to go to bed. We travel, through these worlds of God and he preached the end of the world. And always the same. He hit my mom once. I never forgot that. He once sent me, to the city... for a bottle of whiskey. I was 16 when I drank whiskey. When I returned, my mother was gone. It sold for a few dollars. That night he got drunk And he said, "Boy, lay me down". I took him to the corral, where there was a lime pit and... I left it there, of course. Of course, I put some flowers around. As he had no relatives, I took the car, the horse, the preacher's suit and this Bible. Where will you get it, the money? I dont know. If it were me, I would look for the money, where it is kept. In a bank. For example. In other words, we go to a bank and take the money. That's right, brother. And I know a place. There is no sheriff or commissioner and there are almost no people. They are all in the mountains, looking for gold. You're crazy, Krieser! Yes. What do you want, boy? If you make the slightest noise, you will not speak again. We are running out of time. What's in this box? What's in this box? It is a remittance, from the United States Government. A shipment of what? Of what! Gold. Gold. God help us, brother. Come on! Where is the money? There is nothing. I already sent the money to the bank. Do you want to leave this? There is gold! You heard? Gold! You cannot carry it, on the horse. The key. There must be a key. It's in Texas, they ship separately. He's telling the truth. There must be money in the accounts. I'll ask you the last time: where is the money? I told him. In the bank. I sent it over there. Do you think so? I wonder, if not, we?ve lost all morning. Psst!... People are arriving and the Sheriff, with them. Let's get out of here. Preacher. I'm going, to that bank. But that bank is up front, the Sheriff's. I know, but there is, a lot of money there. And so we will not have wasted the morning. Now you?re crazy. Good morning, Miss. Esther. How are you doing? Something better, thanks. It is not very easy to forget, but life goes on. My money is good! Money always is. I won it. It is the profit of all my work. Someone gave me bank notes from Ohio. Will I be able to receive 3% interest? It is a steal. We were robbed! Help! If they are going to escape us. Yes. Quiet. If you fire that rifle, you're dead. Will you be sacking? "remember the caravan, which you fired three months ago"? Yes. They never came back. I wonder if they are going to meet them. He says he won't fight, for you. I understand. Tell him that I need to pass, for my people. They need supplies. I can buy them. Dried meat, everything you can sell me, horses, gunpowder and ammunition. Five horses. Without gunpowder. No rifles. Ask him again. Tell him, tell him that we are brothers. He won't give you rifles, it's hard to get them. Food. Beef. Flour. Wheat. Do not ask for more. He stopped that gang because he gave you a word, to let your people go healthy and safe. You won't do more. Ask him again. Tell him what they're looking for, a land to live in and that they will fight to make way because they cannot go back. Before the white man, my father and grandfather hunted buffalo, they raised horses. And they took their women close to the Fox River through the grass land. Now we are divided, forever. Now we have our backs to Snow Mountain. And the white man sends soldiers, to finish us off. Tomorrow we will be, like ghosts, like spirits that appear, in dreams without land to live. But we will fight. We will fight ten times, ten years, and our children's children, will continue to fight. We need rifles and ammunition for our fight. Tell him that your enemies are our enemies. He says his black people fought, alongside the enemy against our people. There are no more in the Army. He said that, Buck. No rifles... no bullets. 1800 dollars is your part. For what we received, we thank the Lord. Amen. I go back east, to Illinois. I'm going to buy myself a big tent and organize the largest congregation since King Solomon preached to his people. And you, brother, you already have a good woman. Take the money and do what she says. You may want to go to Canada. Okay brother, a question: How do I get out of here? To Illinois? There are two ways. Go back to where we came from and continue to Canada. There are armed men waiting there. Yes, it is so. What is the other way? Go west through Pecos through the mountains, we will continue, to the north, in another territory. And go around to Canada. How long does it take? All winter. All winter. What are the chances that they won't see me? Not many. You know what? When I saw you eating my roast. I would have crushed you against the rocks. Buck! Buck! The explorers have arrived. These people did not turn around. They followed the caravan. How far from it? A day on horseback from the great river. Ask him how long it would take us to reach them on horseback. Maybe two days. He says he'll give you days, to take you through the mountains Remember, they will not fight for you. I know. Well... it seems to me that it is the shortest path of course. I will try to overcome this and take a chance. Brother... has done a lot for those people, from Santa Ana Parish, more than one person can do. Why do you want to die for them? What happened, did they block, the shortest path? If you find them, they will find them before sunset. Come on, finish, with that caravan. They were not against the law. They will return to their land. What is it, boy? What do you have against them? Is it on your side? Won't you end that crowd? They killed Deshay and robbed the bank. They do not. It was Buck and his friend, and I'm going to find them. But don't you understand? I have to take them, no matter what. If we let them get away now, we will have lost everything. We will continue to act as before. You have to keep things in place and you have 16 men down there. 16 If you leave me in half, I will finish this matter. As long as it depends on me, this caravan goes wherever it wants. And if you do something against these poor people, I'm taking you to Cooper Springs on your horse. Where's Ollie? Upwards covering the passage. He entrusts you with this mission. Yes? He'll let us know if he sees Buck. What do you want us to do? Attacks the caravan. Well, if that's what you said... Come on! You have to take this for them. What are you going to do? Go with the caravan. But... I'll be back later. Here, stay with him. On the other side! Guys, we have to stop your withdrawal! I ran!
