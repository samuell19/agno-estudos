They're all my favorite. -I didn't know that was an option! -[laughter] [neighs] [whinnies] [laughter] -What's this hat doing here? -[gasps] It's nothing. No one. Hey, Lucky, my mom said she could use some help organizing her apothecary. Thanks, Pru. But as of 8:37 this morning, after feeding Grayson's chickens and cleaning out Doc Wilkins' fly traps, I've earned enough money. Good job, Lucky! I haven't seen anyone work that hard since the time you wanted to do all your New Year's resolutions in one day. Or when you tried to throw me the most perfect birthday party in one day. -Or the time you-- -I get it. I tend to get a little overexcited about things. But getting my dad a fiddle made especially for him makes all the flies and chicken poop worth it. Your dad is gonna love it. The Calico City music store said they're delivering it by Mustang Mail. Everything is right on schedule. Oh! This Christmas is going to be perfect! -[neighs] -[gasps] [Lucky] Oh, no! We're late! [Lucky] We're here! We're here! -Sorry we're late! -Again. OK, let's get organized. Everyone, grab the props you need. Whoa! -[girls cheering] -[Snips] Yes, yes, yes! -[Abigail] Yay! -[laughter] [Maricela humming tune] [Mystery neighs] [nickers] [nickers] You want to wear a wreath? [nickers] [neighs] -[Señor Carrots braying] -[Snips] Hey, that's my costume! [braying continues] [nickers] Señor Carrots, give it back! [grunts] Oof! Excuse us, Snips. We didn't mean to stand in your way. What's going on with you two? -Nothing. -Mary Pat! Lying is definitely bad. We don't want coal in our stockings. There's a Nice List and a Naughty List, Snips. -Which do you want to be on? -[Snips] Hm. It's been torture being extra nice to everyone, but it will be worth it when Santa brings me the fencing sword I asked for. And when he brings me the fencing mask I asked for. Oh, nuts! I didn't know I had to be nice every year. Does this mean I'm not going to get the special edition Choo-Choo-Ca-Choo Toy Train with the green caboose I asked Santa to bring me? Maybe you can pretend the piece of coal you'll get is a toy train. Come on, now. Let's stop jabbering and get to rehearsing. Well said, sir! All your words are good! [gasps] [fiddle playing] -T'was the night before Christmas... Oops. -[out of tune] -Hold on. -We've been rehearsing for months, Jim. Don't go changing the lyrics on me now. Oh, my fiddle needs a tune-up is all. [tuning string] [out-of-tune playing] -[groaning] -[whinnying] [sighs] Maybe Mustang Mail can bring your dad his gift right now. All tuned up! And a-one, and a-two, and a-three! T'was the night before Christmas, when all through the house... Not a creature was stirring... not even a mouse. -[Pru] Boysenberry pie? -[Abigail] I made that for Thanksgiving. [Pru] Then how about sticking to the classic, Stone peach pie? Every Christmas, I make a pie. This year, I want to do something different for dessert. -Something new and exciting. -Like what? Like... Like... cake! Your family wouldn't see that coming. [sighs] I'm definitely in a dessert rut. -[nickers] -This elf hat again ? Boomerang, we got to turn this into the Elf Lost-and-Found. Maybe it has a name written on it. "This hat belongs to so-and-so elf." -Abigail... it's mine. -[gasps] Are you a...? No, I'm not an elf! [sighs] When I was five, I took this hat, put it on my head, did a little dance, and helped pass out gifts. My parents have made me do it every year since. Aw! No, not "aw!" [groans] The hat hasn't fit me in years! It's itchy, it's embarrassing, and I am too old to do the Elf-y Waltz! PALs! I got a telegram from the music store. They won't be able to deliver Dad's fiddle! But Mustang Mail never fails. What happened? The telegram didn't say. It just says they'll hold the fiddle for me so I can come pick it up. But tomorrow is Christmas Eve. [sighs] What am I gonna do? Find another gift for your dad? Or give it to him after Christmas? Or make him a gift, like a fiddle out of a box? Now, that's custom-made, one-of-a-kind. But I really want him to have the fiddle for the Christmas pageant tomorrow night. -Or it's pointless. -Then we'll go to the city to get it. Go into the city? Yeah, that might work. We can take the morning train, get the fiddle, and come back with plenty of time for me to yell, "Surprise! Merry Christmas!" [exhales] -All before the pageant in the evening. -[Maricela] Yoo-hoo! PALMs! Did I hear you say you're going into the city? -Yes! -No! I, too, could use a trip to the city. I checked the presents under our tree, and I'm not getting everything I asked for, so I'll need to pop into the stores and pick out what I deserve. Nay, what I've earned. Between the three of you and the horses, you can help carry my surprises. Sure, whatever, Maricela. We can't stop her from getting on the train with us. [neighs] -[Maricela sighs and hums tune] -[Spirit nickers] Um... I hate to be the voice of reason, but won't our parents notice we're missing tomorrow? -[bell dings] -Absolutely not. Tomorrow is Christmas Eve. But, Aunt Cora, we have no choice. I know you, Lucky Prescott. You'll take the train into the city to pick up a fiddle and get distracted rescuing a wounded ocelot, or detaining a jewel thief. We promise not to do any of those things. How wounded is this ocelot? Please, Aunt Cora. We need you to cover for us. That fiddle is the perfect gift for my dad. I really, really want him to have it for the Christmas pageant. Please! [sighs] Go straight to the music store. -Yes! -Yee-hah! [laughter] -[gasps] Oh! -Thanks, Aunt Cora!

[train whistle bellows] [train whistle bellows] OK, PALMs, we are right on schedule. There's Skull Rock! [Abigail] The snow looks like bushy eyebrows. Yeah, it kind of does. [Snips] Mr. Rock should get those trimmed. [laughter] Good one, Snips. [gasps] Snips? [gasps] What are you doing here? I stoled away. Don't worry, I left a note with Mom and Dad saying I was shopping with Abigail. Snips! You have to go back to Miradero. We can't turn around now. We're stuck with him. [Snips] Thank you, Pru. I always knew you were the most raisin-able of the girls. And maybe the least stinky. Why are you acting so nice? Snips is always nice to his friends. -May I offer you a warm beverage? -I could use some chamomile with lemon. OK, sure. Hot chocolate. -Ooh! Me, too. -Apple cider, please. I don't have any of those things. But isn't it nice that I asked? It still counts! [bell ringing] [conductor] Now arriving, Calico City! [brakes squeaking] Spirit, you, Chica Linda, Boomerang and Mystery stay here while we run to the music store. -We'll be back soon. -Are you sure it's fine to leave them? We can't take the horses into the city, and there's more space for them to roam. Spirit will watch out for Mystery, won't you, boy? [neighs] Mystery is perfectly capable of taking care of herself. -Have fun, Chica Linda. -Don't eat everything in sight, Boomerang. [nickers] -Where did you get that? -I shared it with him. Snips gives back to the community. Spread the word! [nickers] [groans] [whinnies] [Lucky] I love the city at Christmas time. [Maricela] Oh, my! Look at those lovely brooches! -I deserve one of each. -Ha-ha! -[bell dings] -[Snips] Yeah! -[Abigail] Ooh! That's it! My dessert rut is over. Instead of making something, I'll get some of these for the Stone Christmas dinner! [bell dings] [man] Why, thank you. [Snips laughs] [balloon squeaking] -[gasps] -I gift you this cheery balloon... from the happiness of my heart. Um... OK, thanks. I'll carry it for you. I'm generous and helpful. Two for one! I fell for that. I've got no one to blame but myself. Come on, PALMs and Snips, let's stay on track. To the music store! [Aunt Cora humming "God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen"] OK. Where did the... Oh. Mm. [Polly cooing] [Aunt Cora chuckles] Merry Christmas Eve to you, too, Polly. Now, just because you're an adorable tiny tot doesn't mean you get to taste the figgy pudding before everyone else. Cora, you old softie. Polly is a girl of her own volition. I cannot control her. She must take after her sister. Where is Lucky, anyway? Probably sleeping in. Lucky, time for breakfast! Oh, don't bother bellowing like a street peddler. Lucky woke up about an hour or so ago. She and her friends went for an early-morning ride. Something about uh collecting pine cones for decorations. There are bundles of pine cones in the forest. I'm sure they didn't go far. [Lucky] It's perfect! Just like I planned. -Let's go. -Yes! Like the wind, Señor Balloon! So, we'll hop on the next train and get home before-- [gasps] -Look! -[Abigail] Oh, my sweet jellybeans! [Pru] There's a Sally Jessup concert in the Grand Theater, today! I adore Sally Jessup. Especially the song that goes... ♪ If we just come together now ♪ ♪ Feel the love that's all around ♪ -Sounds different when you sing it. -Oh, thank you. Perfect! OK, new plan: We'll go to the concert and take the three o'clock train back. You want to skip the pageant? Normal Snips would say "yes" to that plan. But Good Boy Snips says, "I'm telling!" Señor Balloon agrees with me. Just who are you going to tell in the middle of the city? We don't have to skip anything. If we take the three o'clock train, we'll still make it back in time. Are you sure this is a good idea? I love Sally Jessup, but-- Since the pageant doesn't start until the evening, we do have the time. Besides, Sally would never perform in Miradero. And who knows when she'll even be back in Calico City? This might be our only chance of ever seeing Sally Jessup sing in person. Ever! -Let's do it! -Yay! -Yeah! -[Maricela] This is so great! [Maricela] ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ Yes! Here we are. We'll need five tickets. Au contraire. We only need four tickets. Maricela, we need five tickets. One, two, three, four... -Huh? -[Abigail gasps] Snips! Snips! [Pru] Snips! Snips! Boy? Boy? Snips! Snips! Oh, where is he? Don't worry, Abigail. We'll retrace our steps. We'll find him. -Snips? -Small redhead! -Snips! -Snips! [gasps] Look! [Pru] It's Señor Balloon! -Snips! -Little child! [Abigail] Come back! Snips! Snips! Wait, Snips! Hiya! I'm Ivan. -I'm traveling with Nana to Biloxi Canyon. -[Nana] Come along now, Ivan. Hurry it up. Wait. Ivan, where did you get this balloon? A boy with poufy hair traded me for directions. Directions to where? [bell ringing] It's serious-talk time, Snips to Santa. I know I'm falling short in the nice department, but instead of being nice, what if I trade you something? You need a helper? I got a sister who would make a real good Elf-agail. [Abigail] Snips! -[Pru] Snips! -Snips! Snips. -There you are! -We were so worried. Uh... I meant the general "we" - them. Your sister. You can't run off without telling us! That's very, very bad! No! I didn't mean to be bad. I was just trying to be nice by not bothering you while you talked about your boring things. I was gonna meet you at the depot later. Come on, Snips, we should go. We're so sorry, Santa. This won't affect which list we're on, right? But this is why I came all the way to the city. Santa, what's your answer about that trade? She's real good at wrapping gifts. Ho-ho-ho! Santa only brings gifts to children who are nice, little one. You drive a hard bargain. Come on, Snips. I'm sure Santa got all 25 of your letters. And the ten that I sent. Look, Pru. He seems happy in his elf hat. [scoffs] Well, yeah. He's an elf. I'm not. Not with that attitude. [horse nickers] [Mystery nickers] [Spirit nickers] [Spirit whinnies and nickers] Come on! [excitable chattering] -[girls grunt] -[Lucky gasps] [Pru] Sold out? Good plan, ladies. Well, back to Miradero. Huh? Oh, but we're so close! I just want to get a glimpse of Sally Jessup in person. -Me, too. -I know. I, as well. -[thud] -[man] Move it along, Lulu. Quit dragging the tinsel, Hacksaw. Let's hurry! [sighs] I got to find a Christmas gift for the wife after setup, and I don't have a clue. Careful, you guys! This stuff's expensive! I have a plan. Why I always got to bring in the heavy stuff? Hacksaw carried in tinsel. He's bigger than me! They don't want it here, they can move it themselves. [Abigail] I don't think we should be in here. [Pru] We'll get a quick look at Sally Jessup, then leave. No harm in that. [Lucky whimpers] Now, what do women like?

What are you bunch of kids doing back here? Uh... Well... I still can't believe it! We were this close to talking to Sally Jessup! We got to hear her sing a little bit. That's kind of like a concert. Well, at least we'll make it back in plenty of time. [Pru] Come on, Chica Linda. [Chica Linda neighs and nickers] [Spirit nickers] [thud] [Spirit nickers] Ooh! So pretty! [conductor] Due to a snowstorm that's hit Biloxi Canyon, Silverlode and Redbrook, this train has been delayed. Delayed? Don't worry. My dad says this happens all the time. We won't be here that long. [window squeaking] I can't believe we've been here for this long! We have got to get home! [indistinct chatter] [Aunt Cora scoffs] Stop fidgeting, Mary Pat. My apologies. I will be better. [fiddle string tuning] Sounds beautiful, Mr. Prescott. You can hear the harmonic texture of your fiddle. [chuckles] Thanks, Bianca. -Cora, have you seen Lucky? -Anyone seen Pru? She left a note saying she was picking pine cones or some such nonsense. Oh, you know how those girls get distracted by the simplest things. I'm sure they're on their way. [Lucky groans] [sighs] Come on, come on, come on! Let's go! [train horn bellows] -Yes! We might make it after all! -I can't believe it! -[Abigail] I'm so happy! -[Maricela] Oh! What a relief!

That may seem rude, but it's actually ruder to not say anything. Share the news. Snips is nice! [gasps] Señor Balloon! I've missed you! Are they treating you well? Hiya! I'm Ivan. I'm traveling with Nana to Biloxi Canyon. I know. You said that when we met. We just passed Birchwood Junction. That means we're close to Miradero.

[scoffs] Your fans would line up around the block to see you, even if you never wrote another song. You know I don't write songs to sell tickets. I write songs to share my feelings, and, you know, hopefully inspire this topsy-turvy world a little bit. Right now, what I'm feeling isn't very inspirational. [Lucky] There she is.

We only snuck in to try to talk to you, I swear. -And now we're here talking to you! -All your songs are my favorite song. Turns out, I don't need to pick just one. Mine is the one that goes...

He has a name. It's Señor Balloon. [laughs] Well, it's nice to meet you, Señor Balloon. Anyway, it was sold out. I can't deny my biggest fans a performance, right? -Take a seat. -Wahoo!

I'm not sure which direction's the quickest or... even which town we should head toward. [Lucky] I know this area. We passed Birchwood Junction, so it's only about a two-hour ride to Miradero. We'll have to walk. -[others] Walk? -Are you serious? It is cold out here, and I did not wear the proper shoes for this. We don't have a choice! It's getting dark. Miradero is the closest town. Lucky's right. It's our only chance. You expect all of us to walk the whole way there? [men grunting] Oh, Hacksaw, you gave me the heavy end to hold. This just may work. Come on, this way. [Abigail] Let me help. -Thank you. -Up you go. Come on, don't worry. Stay warm. Easy does it. Thank you. -[man grunts] Here we go. -Come on, everyone. This isn't so bad. We'll be in Miradero in no time. [wind whistling] [Jim] Cora? Where did the girls really go? Cora? [Ronny] So far, so good. Just keep walking. I can't believe I'm talking to the Sally Jessup. Are you on tour, Sally? You can't call her "Sally" like you're best friends. You can all call me Sally. OK... Sally! [chuckles] Nope, not ready for that yet. -[Sally laughs] -Where are you headed for Christmas? Hm. That fiddle is prettier than a peacock on parade. Is it yours? It's a Christmas gift for my dad. I hoped to get it to him tonight so he could play it in our Christmas pageant. But that's not gonna happen now. Oh, I'm sorry, Lucky. [horse neighs] [whinnies] What's the matter, boy?

Oh, well, let me turn off the snow, make sure your skin is comfortable. Hmph! [exhales] Tomorrow morning, they're going to find 34 human ice pops in here. What do we do? Everyone's freezing. We need a fire. I know how to make one. Come on, Abigail. -Here's some wood we can use. -Here, too. But it's pretty damp. -Is this going to be enough? -Let's go, Abigail. We found some wood, but it's sopping wet. These little twigs can't start a fire. We need a big piece of wood - dry wood.

Didn't imagine I'd serve Christmas dessert in a dark cave, but I'm sure they'll taste just as good. Sir? Mm! Chocolate babka. What else you got in there? Macaroons, hamantaschen . Reminds me of treats Ma made. Her recipe for apple cake - best ever. I'm gonna bake one this year. -So, you know how to make these? -Mm-hm. I give Mother, Father and Cook a wish list. That way, I get exactly what I want, and they need not stress. [sighs] But this year, I don't know what went wrong. I never know what to give my wife. She's real fancy. Honestly, Maricela, I don't know what she sees in a big lug like me. I hope she likes what I got her this year. I'm sure she'll love whatever you bought her. Yeah? You think she'll like this? Hey! You're right, she'd hate it. Definitely. It's so embarrassing. The thing doesn't even fit me anymore. But I can't tell my parents I'm done wearing the elf hat... can I? Well, when I was a child, every year, my parents folded a star hat out of paper... placed it on my head. I'd have to wear it all Christmas Day. They called me their "Little Christmas Tree." Bet you hated it. [groans] With a passion. Then I had children of my own. Every year, I folded a star hat, stuck it on their heads. And now we do it to Ivan. [laughs] Nana! That elf hat's not for you. It's for your mum and dad. And when you have kids, you'll make them do some daffy tradition, too. And do you know what else they have at Biloxi Canyon? They have lollipops, melted cheese, flags, houses, my parents, rainbows, and dirt. Oh, boy. Let's talk about something else. What did you ask Santa for? Lollipops, melted cheese, flags, houses... You think you'll get all those things because you're nice? -Yep. -But what does "being nice" even mean? It could mean different things to different people. I think being nice means you do something good for someone without wanting anything back. My point exactly. -Hey, Sally. -Oh, hey, Lucky. You should record that song. The one your mom sang to you. The world would want to hear it. Yeah, I hadn't thought about that song in a month of Sundays. Nothing's been the same since she passed away last Christmas. These are my mom's boots. When I wear them, I feel like she's still here with me. [fire crackling] [hooves clopping] [horse nickers] Spirit? What is it, boy? [whinnies] [gasps] Oh, no! Huh? [man] What's going on? The way out of the tunnel is completely covered in snow. If we don't leave, we'll be trapped. How are we gonna get out? Somebody better have an idea! -Kid's right. -We have to do something. -I don't know what to do. -Yeah, he's right. What are we gonna do? Great idea, Spirit!

Miradero's on the other side, I'm sure of it. Come on, everyone! We can do this. [indistinct chatter] We're almost there, I promise. If we survive this, I promise to do all the good things all the time, not just the day before Christmas, and not just because of presents. Who's gonna do the Elf-y Waltz if we don't make it back? [Nana gasps] -Nana! Are you OK? -Gotcha! Here we go. [panting] I just need a moment. [grunts] Me, too. Lucky, how much further to your town? [sighs] I... I don't know. I've never actually gone up this mountain before. [gasps and murmuring] [Snips] Now what are we gonna do? [horse whinnying] [whinnies] [nickers] [gasps] It's Skull Rock! That means we're close to Miradero! With the snow, Skull Rock looks like Santa! Come on, everybody! We're almost there! Let's head to Santa Rock!

[Snips] We survived! [laughter and cheering] I'll wear that elf hat every day. And that's when I saw all these desserts I'd never heard of! I was quite brave. I never let the cold bother me, not once. Now that we survived, Good Boy Snips is here to stay. Everyone, you'll stay in Miradero for the night. You're all welcome in our homes. -[cheering] -[whinnying] [Lucky] I'm sorry I missed the pageant. I went to the city to get you this one-of-a-kind fiddle. It was the perfect replacement for your beat-up one. [sighs] But nothing went as planned. Yeah, this fella is beat-up, isn't it? That's where I dropped it when playing a song for you. You were a month old. It was the first time you smiled at me. And that's when three-year-old Lucky used this fiddle as an oar in her couch-canoe. Dad... The most memorable moments are ones that are never planned. And this old thing is filled with memorable moments. This fiddle, it is one-of-a-kind. Oh, Dad. Now, go to sleep, sweet pea. Will everyone be able to get home tomorrow? Well, the snow has stopped. Though, most of the tracks are still covered. My guess is no. Everyone's Christmas plans are ruined. I think, for now, everyone's relieved to have a warm place to sleep. We'll make the best of the situation. "Make the best of the situation." [birds chirping] [bell ringing] Wake up! Rise and shine! Good morning! Wake up, everyone! [Abigail] Up and at 'em! -[Lucky] Get up, get up, get up! -Huh? [gasps] [Abigail] Good morning, everybody. [in unison] Surprise! Merry Christmas! [music playing] My sword! -My mask! -Yay! Oh! These look delicious! Did you two make all this? Yep! We sure did. [Boomerang nickers] Your wife will adore the embroidered hankie.

You think he wants something in return? I don't know how long I can keep this up. [strums chord] Hey, Sally. I'm sure you had somewhere more glamorous to be for Christmas, but I hope you're having fun. I didn't really have any plans for the holidays. I kind of wanted to forget this one, you know? But that is gonna be hard to do. You and your friends really helped us pull through last night. And then you put all this together for everyone. You are truly inspirational. Oh, my gosh! Sally Jessup just said I was "inspirational!" [laughs] Hey, you want to hear my new song? Do I!
