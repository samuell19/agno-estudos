Henry? Hello, Henry? I don't even know if you'll get this 'cause I don't know what this frickin' French lady is saying, but I'm gonna come there and we're going to talk. Tell each other all the ugly things. No rewrites this time, okay? I'm on my way to you, angel. I love you. I love you. Henry? Hello, Henry? I love you. No rewrites this time, okay? I'm on my way to you, angel. I love you. I love you. I love you. I just want to run away to France together. Write our own movie. -Oh, yeah? -Mm-hmm. About what? I dunno. Oh, we could title it On Our Way. -Rosemary. Nice to meet you. -I'm Henry. Are you feeling weird about the other night? - It was more me. - Actually-- I'm going to make movies one day. I don't want to make the same mistakes my parents did. Honey, your father's a lost boy. If you stay, you become like me. - It's just a movie. - No, it's my life. I love you. Henry? You know that feeling when you're like, "How the hell did I get here?" There should be a word for that. Something in the vein of déjà vu, but not. You go through the events that led up to this moment a million times, trying to make sense of it. You think, "If I had just done this instead, things would be different. If I had just turned back." They say time heals all wounds. As if the most painful part of not being together is when things fall apart. But they're wrong. It's when the shock wears off, and the comfort of you waking up next to me just a few days ago disappears. The more time passes, the further away you seem, Rosie. The details of you, of us, are starting to slip away, and I just-- I want the world to stop before my memories of you become out of focus. Henry, what are you doing? Henry, it's okay, I'm here. Come on, baby. Find me at the beach. Come on now. Pick up the pace. We don't have much time. Once upon a time, there was a young man who carried a darkness on his shoulders. One day, he would be the kind of writer that changed lives with his words. But long before that... he had to save his own. -Rosemary, what are you doing? -It's our story, Henry. The one we were supposed to write together, remember? Come on, let's read through it. Act One: "The Girl." Where are we going? I'm taking you to the night we met. Yeah. I was walking through Soho when I saw you. I never quite understood what you were doing. I guess I just wanted to be noticed. I remember you asked for a cigarette and you looked up at me. I had the weirdest feeling, like I'd known those eyes forever. What's this place? A smelly, old costume shop. I work here. That didn't look like no day job. Yeah, well, people's truths tend to come out at night. You a filmmaker? I see you, walking by, filming the sky, trees, people and shit. Big ass smile on your face. It was impossible not to notice you. Girl in the window. You were the first. You were the most important stranger I ever met. I went back the next day to make sure it wasn't all my head. Hi. Welcome to the shop. - Do you wanna-- - Yeah. I can't get it on. Ooh, she does not look like she's in good shape. -What? -There we go. Come in. Wow. It's colorful. Um, do you mind? So, you're an actress? Yeah, uh... Kind of. Uh, would I have seen you in anything? No, that requires you to actually be in something. Well. Action. Little did you know, I was trying to get my first feature off the ground. It was going pretty miserably. We need to treat it like they don't have any imagination, I feel like. Yeah, 'cause they don't. -Hey, come check it out, look. -Oh, you're finished? Yeah. That looks nice. -All right, Mr. Producer. -Thank you, thank you. And here we got the writer and director. That's all we got? Can't do better? This works. It works for the world. It looks like I'm not even living in this world. When I invest, I really like to get a sense of who I'm investing in. And Henry... your aura... I'm not even sure what the name is for this color... but it's dark. It's... feeling dark. Do you think I have a dark aurora? Nah, man. What times is that meeting tomorrow? You got to find out, man, you know, they love to switch the times. A lot of hurry up and wait. I'm feeling good about it. I am, too. I think the script writer just a little too, you know... soft. I like, uh, something hard. What did she say? Like, you're too hard, and they're looking for something soft and soft -and too hard. -No, other way around. Oh, man. Would you think we need to put more sex scenes in or... Did you really steal from those people like Robbie does in the script? Well, it's loosely inspired by Henry's teenage years after he returned to South Fork. That's actually how we met. I stole David's watch. Yeah, so I took his journal with the first draft scribbled inside. Look, boys, I'm only interested if my princess plays Robbie's love interest, Ruby. You actually might be the reason why we didn't... Shut up. I think we just need to get excited - about the movie. - Yeah, for sure. What if we had auditions? Good call. I think I have someone in mind for Ruby. All right, we're going to do the finale following the full script. -Hi, I'm Sasha. -Hi, my name is Jonathan. I'm Justin Flanagan. I'm from Littleton, Florida. -...from Ireland. -Boston, Massachusetts. -Los Angeles. -I'm reading for the role of... -...Robbie. -...Ruby. -...the role of Ruby. Whenever you're ready. Moments like earlier... ...floating in the water. Fucking free. Isn't that a feeling you want forever? Yeah, of course I do. It's just hard to believe that we're destined for... ...anything greater that-- than we already know. If you don't try, that fear of who you'll grow up to be will just get stronger. It'll weigh you down so deep that the light will become too small to find it, then what? And then you run out of air. One day, you'll have to pull yourself out of your shit. Shit. Can't watch you die on this beach. Don't be a waste. All right, let's do it. Let's do it. Let's float the hell away. All right, that was pretty bad. Maybe it's a sign we're forcing it. We still don't have enough money to pull it off. Ooh, who's that? Hi! I'm really late, but is there any chance of this audition? Whenever you're ready. Moments like earlier with you, fucking free. Isn't that the feeling you want forever? Yeah, of course I do. It's just hard to believe we're destined for anything greater than what we know. But if you don't try, that fear of who you'll grow up to be, it'll only get stronger. It'll weigh you down so deep that the light will become too small to find anymore, and... and then what? And then you run out of air. I know you're right, I just need something to pull me out of my own way. What if I told you I scored two train tickets to the city tomorrow night and a place to stay? I'd ask why the hell are you gonna go ahead and waste that on me? Because I can't watch you die on this beach. One day you're going to have to pull yourself out of your own shit. But I'm here now. I'm right here. Surprise me. Surprise yourself. Don't be a waste. All right, let's do it. Let's float the hell away. Mr. Adler's office, please hold. Wait, you can't go in there, he's in a meeting. -Very busy today, David. -As always. You didn't call or respond to my email, so. Email? Oh, right, your script. Yeah, and audition tapes I sent you. Yeah, I watched them. You got a good eye. Issue is cost, David. -It'll be ultra-low budget. -So, poor quality? No, it'll look super high value, -Henry has-- -The second issue. - Henry. - Here we go. -He stole from you. -That was a long time ago. -He's a thief. -He's had a rough life, yes. Right, right, just because you feel this responsibility taking in him after his father-- This has nothing to do with that. This is about making the film, this is about making something for the culture, -something real that moves-- -With my money? -This was a mistake. -Not saying no, David. I'm saying don't mix up business ventures with personal feelings, son. -Son? -Oh, don't do that. I've always had this thing hanging over my head. I've always felt guilty asking for anything more because you and Mom did me this big favor. But this is my one shot, and I don't have time for guilt anymore. I didn't think we ever made you feel like-- You didn't have to. It came with me. Passionate. That's your mother. You're a hard seller. That's me. I'll take the credit for that. So? So, I'm going to give you what you need. I'm going to give you the rest. But I want to oversee everything, Start to finish. Also, I want a say over final cut, copyright, all of it. You know, uh, I used to dabble in this business a bit myself. I'd have to talk to Henry first. You talk to Henry. Just know I only invest in things I can control. I won't budge. And, uh, David, about those tapes. Those two in particular had a real chemistry. Something the others didn't. You're not gonna be able attract a named actor for the budget, so using those two will add a hook. All right, let's do it. Let's float the hell away. No fucking way. Really? You got the money? -How'd you do it? -Well, I had to go to my dad. -What? David, I thought-- -I know, I know. But I promise we make this thing no matter what, -and now we can. -Thank you. I-- I just don't want you putting yourself out there -like that. -Look, it's worth it. This film means everything to me, too. The thing is... What? ...my dad wants to own 100% of the film. 100%? I know it's not ideal, but I think he can help us. Come on, let's just go make our movie already. I mean, yeah, I trust your opinion more than anyone. Oh, good. Because I want to talk to you about the Robbie part. What, does Papa Adler want to play -the lost boy of South Fork now? -No. Actually, we want you to. Nah, no, thanks, I am trying to quit. Hey, I thought you quit. Then you made it look so nice, and this girl needs herself a little celebration, okay? I just booked a fucking movie, man. Well, in that case. That I actually don't do. -What, whiskey? -No. Drinking. It's in, uh, solidarity with my mom, she's actually trying really hard this time. So, how's the production going? David's dad actually happens to be - backing the film now. - Who's his dad? Hedge fund guy. Him and his wife adopted David when he was little. I don't think he was around much, though. Sounds complicated. Yeah, dads are complicated. - What's up with your dad? - Ah. Don't remember him much. Moved to France when I was little. Where are we going? We are finally getting out of South Fork, baby. - What? - Yeah. You remember Tosin, right? -What? Where are we going? -France. - France? - Yeah. Yeah. Grandma and grandpa are coming too. What about Papa? Honey, your father's a lost boy. And if we stay, we're just going to end up lost with him. Now just rest, my love. And when you wake up, you won't be afraid to dream past this life anymore. Oh! Hey! Henry! When my mom and grandparents passed, I went back there to look for him. Hey, Dad. - You find him or? - Uh, no. Well, look at you now. About to make your first movie. I actually made my first movie when I was ten. Of course you did. About what? You want to see it? Welcome to my studio. "Ish" I'm not even going to ask. This is my little screening room. Take a seat. This is our house in France. I've named the house Entry to Artiste. Because we are the artists. -Yeah. -Smile for my first movie. Hi, I'm Henry and I'm in France, baby. I'm a bird. You can be a bird too. Let's fly away, come on. I don't think they're home today. But, in here I can see our whole future. I'm gonna make movies one day. I'm the king of France! I'm the king of France! Tosin, take the camera, I want to show my mom something. You put your hands on her face, you'll get magical powers. Here. It'll make you happy. - She's beautiful. - Yeah, she really was. Mom, you're so pretty. Come here, my baby. That's nice, that's what it's supposed to look like. My grandparents were such winos. Working on anything interesting right now? I'm rehearsing "Tartuffe" at the Comédie-Française. Lucky you, I'm still waiting for a call from my agent. The call never comes. What shall we paint today? - A heart. - A heart it is. Tosin would paint on my face all the time. Now we're connected. My mom would keep me up late dancing with her. Tosin, come under here with us. Tosin remarried and lives full-time in London now. The place is like a total ghost town. - Hide both of us. - Yeah. That's why I love film. You can relive moments like this. I want to be in this moment forever. Doesn't have to be as dark as the real thing. Everyone. The end. But if it's not real what's it for? -Hey! How you doing? -Hey! Are you feeling weird about the other night? -No. -I wasn't trying to make a move. I know, I know. It was more me, actually. Yeah, yeah, it was-- But I liked it. I just, um, no, I also want to be professional. And I believe in you, this character, I'm not-- I don't want you to be a part of this because-- -I mean, I am attracted to you. -Okay. Okay, I'm going to talk myself into a hole, this is bad, I don't even... How about we go grab a bite to eat? Cool, do you know any places around here? Yes, burgers, and, uh, there's no kissing allowed, so. No kissing allowed. Okay, yeah, if it's a burger and then we'll just go. That's such a weird coincidence. We're all going to be doing a movie together. I need a cheers to that. - Yeah. - That deserves a cheers. - Okay. - Cheers! Just-- you know, I don't usually drink this much, but it's really cool. So, Rosie said you wanted to do costumes -for the film? -Mm-hmm. You were telling me about a dance scene with, like, jewelry. How does that go? Like, what is that? What does that look like? I'm a visual person. -Okay. -Would you guys show me? I haven't really worked it out. That's okay. It's on the spot. Yeah. -Yeah? -Yeah. -Yeah. -Well, I wasn't plan... I think it... Well, I want it to be, like, start off as, like, a light-- I wanted all of them to start sort of down, and then-- and then Santo is given the jewels and he kind of rises up. And maybe there's a little ballet. - Yes. Flowy. - A bit of that. But then again, there're lots of voices, maybe it's just... It's funny how when you fall in love with someone it feels like you're living in this constant state of past, present and dream. When I was little, I'd stand at the edge of my mom's bed reenacting old films. Stop, to run across to him, take him in my arms and tell him I love you. You silly, silly man, I love you. Is that what made you want to act? I think it was more bad luck. In my mom's face, when she'd watch me, you know when, like, a little firefly lights up again. For a moment. And then it's gone. Yeah. Like a small reminder of hope. Then I guess I just knew I wanted to make other people feel that somehow. Well, you made me feel it, that's for sure. When I was with you, I could feel this part of me I thought I lost a long time ago. This burnt-out firefly, or whatever you want to call it, turned back on again. And I wanted to hold on for as long as I could. Wow. -How are you doing? -I'm good. Is this your regular date spot? Yeah, I take all my boyfriends here. Wow. I thought I was special. A darker ending would give us the best shot. Look, I appreciate you helping us make this film-- Save the film. Save the film, okay? You've been trying to get this film off the ground for six years. I'm on board a few weeks and it's practically done, for crying out loud. Look, David... your job as producer is to find out where the real story is. The guts, the meat. The meat, you know? Meat and potatoes of the movie, that's your job, and this little fairytale, silly ending just ain't it. What's real is what you told me about what happened when Henry went back searching... Hey, I wasn't supposed to tell anyone. ...finds his father and they-- I wasn't supposed to tell anyone that. -Henry will freak out. -He's not gonna fr-- it's not going to be the exact story. It's just inspired by it. Writing about this better life is what got Henry through it all. He needs his hopeful ending. Well, unfortunately, people don't want to see his hopeful ending, okay? They want to see a dark, twisted, freaky, gritty, nasty, bizarre, weird shit, and that's what they want to see, in fact, that's all I want to see when I go to the movies. This is Henry. Leave a message. Hi, baby, it's taking longer to close up the shop than I thought, but I'll be there soon, so we can celebrate. Love you, birthday boy. Nice time. It'll all be worth it soon. Hey. Hey. Who the hell was that guy? Why don't you go brush your teeth, okay? Uh, we missed the last train, so he gave us a ride from the diner. Yeah? -You look pretty. -Thank you. Hey. Come here. I'm serious, you look beautiful. Very beautiful. You know, why don't we put Henry to bed, me and you can have some time together? We haven't done that in a while. It's been a lot longer than that. You reek. Hey, get in there, boy. Yeah. Go on, come on. What's up, birthday boy? Look at your moves, yeah. Yeah. Get down, man. One day, this could all be yours, look at that. But that stuff isn't yours, Papa. Hey, who told you that? Your mom tell you that? -Let's just keep dancing. -No, no, no. If it wasn't for me busting my ass, while she's gallivanting all over the city, we'd have nothing. Come on, do I look stupid to you? I know where you guys were. Trying to be the next Moulin Rouge or whatever. Hey, look at me. Dreams like that, they don't exist for people like us. She used to look at me like I was a hero. But things change. But that doesn't matter because I got you. You're my legacy. You're gonna grow up to look like me one day. Let's get you to bed, Papa. No, no, no, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop. I need you to learn something. Look at yourself. Okay, now I want you to imagine the man you're going to be. That's good, yeah. What does he look like? Envision him. Now what would he say to you? Can you hear him? What's his story, Henry? What's your story, Henry? All I knew is what I didn't want. To be the lost boy who couldn't love you right because he was too busy getting in his own way. So, I tried. I tried so hard to love you the way you deserved. But when filming came around, my past that I had hid from you caught up with me. Get your asses up. It's movie making time. Come on. What's wrong? I'm nervous to go back there. I'm going to be with you this time. I don't know what to say to her. I know how much you love her, Rosie, but if you keep giving in, she's not going to be able to figure out how to take care of herself. Let's get dressed. You're sick of your fancy life in France -or something? -Something like that. Oh, it's not like that? You left with your mom. You made your choice, and you come back seven years later? What's it like, Henry? She's dead, Dad. Cancer. Hey, guys. Nah, he's a great kid, I want you to meet him today, okay? Well, come by. Come by, we gotta have dinner. It's been a long time. Take care. All right. Are we all set on wardrobe? -Perfect. -All right. nail polish. No, I love the nail polish. Keep it. Hey, Henry! Why don't you show him how to swipe something on camera, so it looks authentic, what do you say, huh? -You're good at that, right? -Right. It's in your wheelhouse, isn't it? Um... Too sweet. What? When did you get so good at that? Uh, look, I found your letters. About needing money and I wanna-- You have money? No, but I heard the guys you owe are looking for some new hires. Those guys are not to be fucked around with. Hey, Henry! I'm going to slip the call sheet under your door for tomorrow. Rest up, buddy. Johnny, you sure? Once he's in, he's in. Stop. Address. Time. Don't fucking let him be late. No son of mine is gonna end up being a thief. Hey, hey. Babe, what's wrong? I just feel like this part is, um... I can't even see the present moment because it's just flooded with all these fucking memories. Go on, Dad. Everything's going to be fine. I'm here now. I promise. In the script, you described Robbie as the sand and Ruby as the water. What's that about? Just because as a teenager, I felt like-- like stuck, shattered pieces. I'd go and sit by the hotel pool... wishing that somebody like her would pull me out of it. All right, well, let's use that. Oh. Okay. Let's see. Yeah. You are a blonde. Go wash it off. Have I told you how nice it is having you here? I'm never going to leave you. Go to the bathroom. Be with your boy. Conserve water. Shower together. Think of Mother Nature. Are you feeling more ready for tomorrow? Actually, yeah. Is this why girls are always dyeing their hair -after breakups? -Pretty much. Well, this is just temporary, so... now don't go falling in love with Robbie. Why not? Well, you know, there's this guy, Henry. Not sure you know him, but he's gunning pretty bad for you. I always found his character more interesting anyway. I really do, though. What? Love you. I really do, too. That's why I gotta make this movie. - See if it's true or not. - If what is? The voice inside my head that tells me I'm going to wash up in South Fork, a lonely monster. Why are you so afraid of that? Ah, it's nothing. Just note to self, don't make your next movie so personal. Pay the guy. Give him his fucking check - or anything. - Check is dead, boss. In the beginning I told you had to pay you didn't wanna pay. Ooh la la. Anyway, I pretty much did what I needed to do, let's put it that way. Fuck, yes! Fuck the system! Excuse me. What did you do to yourself? It's dope, right? It's to help us get into character. It's not dope. It's fucking moronic. You look like a dead bleached rat fell in your head. -Well, I wouldn't go that far. -What is wrong with you? Sorry I-- I didn't mean to upset you. I didn't invest in your little film so you could mess everything up because you are too busy fucking with the actress to focus, all right? God, I should never listen to my son about you. Never. Well, okay, David didn't know anything about this, and I'm sorry, I should have ran it by you. But, um, listen, our target audience... You're going to hit this off. What's going on here? Nothing. We're-- we're dope, right? I want a rough draft of my ending in my hands tonight, okay? In my hands. Or I'm pulling the plug. His ending? We'll still film your original, and I promise that's the one we will use, but we'll shoot his version, so we can get him off our backs. - Okay? What is it? - Uh, Robbie not-- not making it out of South Fork and, um, jumping off the cliff. David, did you-- did you tell him? No, no, I-- I-- he thought of it on his own. Look, it-- it's just a movie. It doesn't have to be a reflection. It's me, David, of course it's a reflection of me. I can't write that. I wouldn't have got my dad involved, but it was our only option. My back is against the wall here. We shoot it, he's happy. Done. We will not use it. And that's not going to be my ending? I promise. -Uh, all right. -Thank you. -Hey, guys. -What's up? -How are you doing? -Sorry to keep you waiting. Action. And now you have to put it in the pile. If I see one more local get replaced by these pretentious lobster-bib-wearing assholes, I'm fucking out of here. Yeah? Where the fuck you gonna go? This is why we do what we do. Our hotel guests have been missing a lot of stuff. I think it's these local kids. I know one of them. His father was the one involved in those burglaries a few years back. - Cut. - Hey, guys. Sorry to keep you waiting. There's been a lot of changes in the schedule, so you all wrapped up for the day. Thank you so much for your work. - Great job. - I appreciate it. -Thanks for coming out, man. -Hey, great work. -Where are you goin', big boy? -Work. Just like that? I told you you're gonna blend in. I'm not doing that shit anymore. I got a real job. It's a lifeguard over at the new hotel. I-- I'm going to try to pay the guys back that way. What? What are you talking about, what happened? I need another hit. I need another hit. Don't you think she's lost enough? I'm not doing it. I can't. Oh, shit. Henry, what-- Hello. Yes, we need your pool. I'll hold, I'll hold. You don't get the pool, I can't give you the money. I can get people over here right now, I can. - Well, pay for it. - Guys, stop arguing. - What's going on? - Yes, we will need to use your pool for a film shoot today. I don't understand how am I supposed to shoot this pool scene with this fucking pool cover on? I-- I told you, this ain't your regular tarp. It's custom. It takes six guys six hours and you didn't wanna pay. I could do it with three guys in one hour. Relax, relax! I found one. What? What did you find? You found a pool? -I found a pool. -Where did you find a pool? -At a motel. -Why didn't you say so? -Nice shades. They're real steel. How's it going today? Fancy a swim? Come on. We're safe here. I've got you now. Just close your eyes. The water and I will carry you now. I forgot what it feels like. - What? - To be free. -Hey. -What's up? Oh, I was just checking to see how you were. I read that alternate ending, and it was-- It's what you wanted, right? You know it wasn't me who wanted that. And I told you we just have another option. It's not an option for me, dude. Look, I'm grateful, okay? I know I couldn't have done this without you, without your dad. -But writing that, it really-- -I know, I know. No, I don't want Rosemary seeing me like that. I want to know the guy that fights, that doesn't give up. Not that bullshit. Look, I get it. But I think you need to stop focusing on what happens to Robbie and decide if Henry is going to be that guy. -Look what I got. -Hmm. So, you guys excited to shoot a double ending or what? You know what Kubrick said? -What? -He said, "Making a movie is like trying to write a poem while on the rollercoaster." Sounds pretty impossible. I have an idea. - Where are you going? - Come on! He's waking up, Henry! - We can't do this. - Come on, Henry. Welcome to the Lost Boys Bay on Six Flags, baby. What do you want us to do with this. -All right. -Write a damn poem. I was here. I know my car was right here wasn't it? Now I got a fucking headache. Where is my car? Anybody! Where is my car, damn it! Yep. Check that out. "We think you're pretty cheesy." "But fuck-ups like us like cheesy. So even though this shit ain't easy, and we have no clue where we're headed, we feel overwhelmingly indebted. All that really matters today is that we're on our way." Fuck you! - It's nice. - Ugh. I can't give you-- I can't give your boy a choice. I can't give your boy a choice. Tony, come on. Johnny, send him back. You know what happens if you don't. "The last word my mom used to describe my father before we left was 'lost.' 'He's a lost boy,' she whispered. I didn't understand the sentiment at the ripe page of ten, but seven years later, sitting right back on the sucking hole of a couch my mother gently swooped me away from, I noticed my reflection is quickly turning into my father's. I came back to South Fork with the naive idea that I could be the one to save him. But one can only ignite the Savior in another. And there is no Savior that lies within the walls of my father's chest." My mom is right, "If you stay, you'll get lost with him." "So, in moments like this, of complete and utter hopelessness, I set one foot on the pavement of my rotten home town and one foot into the unknown water, hoping the story I'm about to write about a lost boy named Robbie who befriends a girl named Ruby ignites strength within me to float hell away from here." Baby, what are you doing? I just had a bad dream. I'll be back. Dad? Dad? Dad! Dad! Dad! Henry! Henry, come on, man. Let's just check playback. I told you my idea for the ending was gonna be great. That is an ending. This is captivating. Look at yourself. The man you're gonna be. Cut, print. That's the one. What's your story, Henry? Bravo. Great job. -Wait, what? -Yeah, yeah. All we need is a few exterior shots at South Fork and we are a wrap on time, on the budget. -Great work, everyone. -No, Dad, we still have the original ending to shoot tomorrow. Great work. Yeah, that's been cut. What the fuck are you talking about? Dad, don't do this. We had a deal. We've got the ending we need, Henry. No. That can't be it. I-- I can't end up with nothing, lose her, die here. Mr. Adler, I'm-- Henry, breathe. It's not actually happening to you. He's right. Henry, it's just a movie. No, it's my life. You stole it and I want it back. I don't steal, you agreed to sign the rights over, and I'm doing my job now to sell this thing. And I'm very sorry you're all broken up about your dad. -How about you grow the fuck up? -What did you say? Hey, Henry, stop, stop, Okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Get the fuck over it. I told him. I knew it. - Henry! - Let him go. -We'll finish it without him. -No! No! You think you can take and take. Sometimes there's nothing left. Is that fair, David? Is that fair for you to say that to me? Look around, look at everything that I've done. I'll stop you before you say you did it for me. David... Hey, what the hell are you doing? I'm just having a few sips. It's been a long few weeks. It's not a big deal. I don't wanna make you like this. You're not making me like anything. Come on. I just wanna run away to France together. Write our own movie. -Oh, yeah? -Mm-hmm. About what? Who the hell knows? I was rereading that poem that you and David wrote. And there was this line about not knowing exactly where we're going, but only caring that we're on our way. Well, we could title it that. Title it? On Our Way. Yeah, I like it. I have a funky typewriter at home you could write it on. Go to sleep. You should get some rest. Dad! Dad! I was so scared something happened. What are you doing out here? I don't want you to have to live like this. Scared all the time. You're too talented for that bullshit. I saw some of your writing the other night. You have a way with words. Dad, stop. You said it yourself. That life isn't for people like us. It's done. I already told Tony. I-- I'm going to go back to work for him. No, you're not. No son of mine is going to end up being a thief. You're going to go out in the world, and you're going to create something of your own. I know you came here to help me but I'm not worth it, so... Why don't you just float the hell out of here before you get stuck for good? You're worth it, okay? You're worth it to me. Henry, you are not listening to me. If you stay... you become like me. They'll kill you if I don't go back. I don't care what you say. I'm going to fix this. Dad. Dad, no! Dad! Dad! Dad, no! Dad! Rosie. Rosie! Baby. All right. That's all you gonna say to me after everything, you can't? I don't know what you want from me. I want you to fight for us. I-- I-- So you're just going to leave me? I love you. Please, can you just let me love you? Stop. Don't go. Please, please don't go. -Please. -I can't. You know, before he met you, I was fucking scared for that kid. Living in reality has always been too hard for him. But then you came along and for once, he didn't want to escape. Right. Then why did he leave? That ending we shot... that wasn't just some story that... actually happened to Henry's father. He jumped off those cliffs down there right in front of him. And you guys let him relive that? What the fuck is wrong with you? I know. I know. I know. Believe me. And it doesn't fix anything but... I deleted it, there's no ending now. I need to talk to Henry. He gave me this. Go remind him of those fireflies. He talks about you... a lot. Henry? Hello? Henry. I don't even know if you'll get this 'cause I don't know what this frickin' French lady is saying, but I'm going to come there, and we're going to talk. Tell each other all the ugly bits. No rewrites this time, okay? I'll see you soon. I'm on my way to you, angel. I love you. I love you. Hey, it's Rosie. I'm not here right now, so leave a message. What's it like, Henry? That's all you say to me after everything, - you can't? - I don't know what you want from me. I want you to fight for us! She's dead, Dad. I think it's pretty obvious I can't take care of you so... ...I'm trying but it keeps getting worse and worse. And I'm getting-- Stop! I already told you I don't want to see this, okay? This is the end, you have to. Wa-- wa-- wait. Do-- do you hear that? -What? -The music. This is-- the story, it's still going. -It's not over. -Henry. No, no, no, I remember, Rosemary, I remember. I remember why I tore the script pages off the walls. I-- I remember why I threw them away. The ending was wrong. What's in here is bullshit. Henry, it's not wrong. It's what happened. No, no, no. I'll tell you the ending, okay? I'm on my way, you angel. That's right. I'm on my way, you angel. I'm on my way to you, angel. I'm on my way to you, angel. I'm on my way to you, angel. Remember that. I'm on my way to you, angel. I'm on my way to you, angel. I'm on my way to you, angel. I'm on my way to you, angel. I'm on my way to you, angel. I'm on my way to you, angel. I'm on my way to you, angel. I'm on my way to you, angel. I'm on my way to you, angel. Hello. If I had known that I was coming here to pick up your mess, I probably would have saved myself a trip. - All right. - Carry my bags. Remember how we used to talk about all the films we would make together someday. Yeah, I remember. And don't you feel like, you're just giving little bits of your soul out every day for free? Nothing's free. Especially your soul. See, Rosie? You're fine. You made it there. What's it gonna take for a man to get a piece of bacon around here? Hey. Well, I don't know if I would qualify you as a man, but how about I give you a bite of my food for each piece of the story you give me. The real story. I don't think so. I'm feeling kind of funny. I think I'm gonna go upstairs and take a rest for a while. Rosie. Rosie! Rosie? Henry! Henry! Rosie? What shall we paint today? - How about a heart? - A heart it is. Hold still... How's that? Rosie! It's not really helping. Rosie! Don't slip away from me, okay? Don't slip away from me. Henry. Henry, the only way out is to let me go. Rosie. Rosemary. Henry! - Rosie! - Henry! Rosie! Rosie! Henry, I'm right here. Henry. I'm going to come there and we're going to talk. Tell each other all the ugly bits. No rewrites this time, okay? I'm on my way to you, angel. I love you. I love you. Hey. - Hey. - Hello. I'm really happy you finally came home. What with the thought of you... You know you're my family, right? It's just too much to face. And then when Rosemary, uh... when she died... I tried to ignore it, but it only made me worse. You really want to make this thing with me? I know I've blown things. I just believed if I stayed... I'd become like him. And take you guys down with me. But leaving... Look what I did. I didn't think that there would be a repeat. - I know, right? - Where is he? Hey. You ready? Yeah. There are a lot of beautiful faces in there. A lot. -You guys are ready? -Yeah. - Let's do it. - All right. Cheer up. Ladies and gentlemen, may I ask that you please take your seats at this time. The program begins momentarily. Remember me? I remember standing on that pier, and suddenly I felt my younger self pull me back. And I remembered him. The boy who just wanted to love and be loved, and make movies. It took me a while to get here, but I did it, Rosie. - I made a movie. - I love you. Maybe we couldn't last forever but I know our story will. To my firefly, I'm here, and I won't stop trying. For you, for me, for him.
