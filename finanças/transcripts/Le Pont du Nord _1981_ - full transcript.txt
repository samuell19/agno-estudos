October or November, 1980 -- already long ago -- Between us two, Babylon. THE FIRST DAY I'll get down here, thanks. Bye! Excuse me, I can't come in. Could you bring me a croissant, please? No, make that 2 croissants. Thankyou. "Removals" Can I help you? Is there something I can do? Get out of the way! Is that you, Julien? Do you know when he'll be back? Do you have his telephone number? OK, too bad, thanks, sorry to disturb you. "Dear Mathias, Hope that all is well at the Hotel Sante'" "See you soon" "See you soon!? Marie" Hey! You? That's enough! What's this? -- It's my record! -- No, it's mine! -- What is this record? -- That's him who stole it! "The Police"... -- Who does it really belong to? -- Me! Me! Hey! No more fighting! The weakest shall have it. I'm not the weakest. He's the one who took it! -- And now? -- Well, then. Could you give me a hand? Could you go to the hotel and ask whether Julien L'Ange still lives there? -- There you are. -- Oh! Thank you! Hello, Julien? It's not so easy to get hold of you. Do you still recognize my voice? Phew! I was afraid... That's fine. I've never been up there. I'll be as quick as I can. Wait for me, Julien. Hah! Oh well, see you, I'm going that way. If you're going that way, then so am I. Ah? Why? One, two, three. What's your name? Marie! Marie, that's right, it had to be Marie. Why? It had to be. Don't try and understand. No, I won't try. And you. What's your name? I'm called... Baptiste. Baptiste? Baptiste isn't your real name. It's my name. I don't have another. You're the first person I've come across -- all these people in all these streets -- ...who needed me. I need only one person. And it's not you. Not me? You need me more than you think. Why? Once, twice, three times. Once, OK, that's an accident. And again, twice, that's chance. But three times, that's destiny. There's no such thing as destiny. When you say that, it's still destiny. Ah! And if I hadn't said it? It's the same -- it's destiny again. Your "destiny", Baptiste, is just gossip. Everything isn't written down in a book I know very well that we can't always choose freely. But if you are lost, like a leaf in the wind... -- here, could you take my bag -- ...it's not because you decided that things should change. But I'm not stupid... ...I don't believe in miracles any more. Things don't change just because you want them to. But -- even so, I want to believe that we're not caught in a trap. And yes, I have decided to fight. And right now, more than yesterday, more than tomorrow... ...and the day before yesterday, and now more than at any other time. And I've been thinking that.... Marie.... .... help yourself.... .... and the heavens will help you. If they want to, Marie. Who? If they want to. But don't imagine you can do whatever you want to. From A to Z. It's all fore-ordained. But listen, Baptiste, I am free. Look: I can take one step left... ...then two steps right. Watch out. Look... ...I can lift my arm, so! Yes, you have just lifted it... ...towards a hidden star. There! Hiding behind that huge cloud there above us. Like a white whale... ...it reached for your hand... ...across the gulf of space... ...and the entire galaxy! But no! Not at all! The star [L'Etoile] is down there. In front of us. Farewell, Baptiste! See you again soon, Marie! It was awful! I couldn't breathe in the lift. Feel better now? Yes. You know, they didn't change you. You're beautiful, Marie. You're beautiful. I'm all out of breath. I've been running the whole way. I was waiting for you. You know, I've been waiting for you, such a long time. Me too, I've been waiting. It's nice, this cliff in the middle of the city. You haven't forgotten that l like wide open spaces. What's the matter, Julien? Is there something wrong? You could have let me know that you were getting out today. Have you moved? Where do you live now? Yes, I'm moving all the time. I'm not very settled. Because of your gambling debts? No, it's not that. I'll explain. Here. Take this. For my hotel room. You're expected. A hotel? I couldn't even step through the door. What was it like, down there? If you insist I'll give you the address, but it has to remain a secret between us. What'll we do now? Will you take me out to eat oysters? No, Marie, I've got some business to attend to. But in 3 days it'll be over. I love you, Marie. We'll meet up tomorrow morning. Wherever you want. What's going on between you and that guy? He's someone who's important to me. Your fiancee? Yes.... if you like. Then how come you didn't stay with him after you found him? Did your love grow cold? I hadn't seen him in such a long time. The place I was staying at, it was... ...it was like a boarding school. I could never stand for such a thing. Because as soon as I feel locked up... ...I have to escape. It's stronger than anything. It was rather difficult to escape from where I was staying. It was he who gave me the strength to live through it. Actually, I was in prison. I just got out this morning. Understand? Why did they lock you up? Stupid mistakes. I was tricked. And because of my record, I was in for a year. That's normal. We're all being watched. Tell me, how did you survive there inside? Like all the others... I'd rather not talk about it. In there, the only thing that changes is the date. And I thought about Julien all the time. He wrote to me, came to see me as often as he could. When I was arrested we'd only known each other for a week. So it was like a great big novel, then? It's not a novel Baptiste, it's real life. Real life? That's a reign of terror. Now Julien is everything to me. You know, Baptiste, over the years I believed all sorts of things... ...and then I had, well, time to reflect. And finally, the only thing that left to us... ...is love. Even if sometimes it's like a deathly pain. Oh, well... let's go. Here, could you take my bag, because.... (I need to have a piss) Love... ...that great fantastic lightning bolt... so enormous, so extraordinary... ...and of such intensity that it sends all the senses flying... ...into dreams... Isn't that beautiful? No. No, rather it's a lasting light. It needs time to work its spell. Oh, what a day! I'm tired out. And you? No. Where do you sleep? Everywhere.... nowhere It's all the same to me. When I was squashed in my cell for 2 months I dreamed of a big double bed with white silky sheets. The king-size bed of the Tropicana Motel What's that you say? It's a magic bed I've been told about. I don't know whether it's magic, but the fact is since this morning... ...I can't stay inside anywhere. I get trapped by the open air. -- It's better that way, Marie... ...all the hotels are under surveillance. Oh yes, I know that. OK, let's go. But not like you think. It's an absolute surveillance. At every second. All that you say, all that you do... Do you really think that? I know that. I know it! THE SECOND DAY What charming manners. Look after my armour. People are very small this morning, have you noticed? The food, it's really...(disgusting) Got to eat. I'd like some small mandarines please? Clementines, madam --Ah yes, they're clementines. --How much? --A pound. --A pound. Want some? I'm not eating. I'm only eat when I'm completely starving. You really don't want to eat? -- No. A bit of cheese. That'd do you good. How much are these shoes? -- ......... -- Pardon? -- 10 francs. -- They're very nice. -- Ah yes? -- Try them! -- And the soles? Are they in good repair? -- In very good repair, madam. -- Can I try them on? -- Go ahead. I'm wondering whether they aren't... old-fashioned? The size is the important thing. That's what counts. -- Yes. -- Old-fashioned? -- Do they feel OK? -- Well... old-fashioned? -- Do they suit me? -- Absolutely! -- Very, very nice. They're a bit, um, Minnie Mouse. You know, you have to walk in them for a while... How did it go?.... Where did you sleep? Don't worry about me, everything's fine. And you... Where were you? Wherever you are, I'll come. You must be patient, Marie.... Believe me. Afterwards we'll never have to leave each other any more. Why? Julien, you must tell me the truth. I want to know what you're doing? Marie.... I know that it's hard for you. ...But you must trust me. In the end it'll be worth it, I swear. I know you've got things to settle, but, at least tell me what it's about. Don't think about it. At all. I already told you: in 3 days. Three days, three nights, without knowing. Do you understand what it means? Already yesterday it was in 3 days. .... And tomorrow? And tomorrow? Eh? In three days. Let me try my luck. Here, I'll leave this with you. Play... Here are the cards. Let's go. It's Lady Luck. All up. Wait a minute, sir. This gentleman has won. Here. And you have lost, sir. All right, let's go. In play. And here's the red card. Find it, find it. Everyone's a winner at this game. Come on now... Place your bets. This one, sir... You have lost, sir. -- Oh, shit! -- Don't say anything! -- Baptiste! Baptiste! -- Lost everything! -- As usual. Aren't you the clever one! I'll take a taxi. Have you got 100? See you later... Stalingrad. -- Don't you want this? -- Oh yes. See you. Why did you take Julien's satchel? -- Because I saw and I know. -- What'd you see, and what do you know? I don't think you should have taken his satchel. I have a bad feeling about it. That's for you to understand. So what? It's just a map of Paris. -- And why are these drawings here? -- That's just to make you ask why! Here, give me that. Let me. "Black Squad attacks the postmen" "Maury-Laribiere kidnapper arrested in Tours" "Pitoun kidnapping: no word from the kidnappers" "The C.R.S. saved my life" "Mesrine wanted to kidnap Philippe Bouvard" "The prince's assassin is a hired killer" "Mesrine's chauffeur arrested" "As he fled, Hyvert killed the restaurant owner" Hmm, that girl's pretty. Looks like an actress. What are those letters? That kind of letter. Hebrew... "Why Empain was freed" "Lawyer kidnapping: ransom handover failed" "Lyon kidnapping: mastermind arrested" "To be the strongest" I don't understand why some things are underlined in red and others not. I don't know what it means. "It's in everybody's interest that M. de Broglie does well" "At Aix-en-St.Denis, Alexandre Sanguinetti has just died at the Val de Grace hospital..." "... as a result of a massive heart attack" -- That's how it goes! "Pierre Fit has taken a position on the Golman affair" I don't understand. I don't understand what all that means. "De Broglie: the police close in on the killer" -- Again. "Three gangsters get away" -- Again "Ampin and his wife Sylvana...." It's funny the way they all have their spectacles way up in their hair... I've never understood why... generally specs sit on the nose, more or less. "Golman got 9 thousand", yes. "The Boulin affair: the R.P.R. is reunited" "Mesrine slain. His accomplice too." "De Broglie: he had the gift of friendship" "An ex-minister assassinated in Paris" "The victim's body lay on the pavement for more than one hour" "Two witnesses: a concierge and a Spanish cleaning woman" "With closed eyes, Dutronc has stumbled into the Swiss imbroglio without knowing what awaits him" "Dassault's personal situation has reached crisis point" "Rue Copernic affair: on the trail of the motorbike man" "Lyon kidnapping: the anguish of Bernard Galle" Ah, now they've found the gun at that policeman's place, Simonet... ...who murdered Debreuil. It still doesn't make sense. Ah, now it's my turn! "Credit Lyonnais at Saint Ouen" "Two criminals wounded, the third escapes" -- That's you there? -- Yes. Marie LaFee. I'm asking myself what I'm doing there.. And that guy, who's he? Well, as it says... "The young Mathias D. and his accomplice Marie LaFee" It's a young guy who joined up with me to do a job. You see the way we look? Always like that in the papers. He's a friend. He's my young partner in crime. We got together, just like that. I came back.... from abroad where I'd been for several years... ...in Germany, in Italy. Just about everywhere in Europe... But that's a long story...don't really want to talk about it now. A long story... quite a few years ago. You probably weren't even born yet. And then, I happened across a group of really nice people. I dunno, they explained that we should take money where we found it, that... ...that the real robbers... ...were perhaps the banks, or... ...that's why we did the Credit Lyonnais at Saint Ouen... Perhaps not the best choice... But at Saint Ouen, or somewhere else... And then I... in fact it was Mathias and me who were tricked. Perhaps I was, how to put it... I dunno, manipulated. In any case... ...we became the victims because we weren't specialists. Mathias is still in prison, he was in for 3 years. If I hadn't found the money for his lawyer... ...dunno, maybe he'd have been put away for much longer... A really nice guy. Can't say that one person is a victim more than another. I'm almost certain that those people used us. -- Obviously -- Ah, yes. Now, in any case, they've dropped us, I suppose that's normal. -- It's normal. -- We should have expected it. Yes, it's normal! We weren't professionals with plots and plans and tricks and scams... The Credit Lyonnais at Saint Ouen... That's how it goes... All over...in the past... -- Come on, give me the briefcase. -- As you wish, Marie. -- In any case your Julien is always early. -- No, it's me who's late. -- You don't say goodbye anymore? -- Goodbye. See you! Baptiste. Here. A present for you. That won't do at all. You shouldn't have done that, Marie. You're out of your mind. I already told you, Julien. I need to know. You're well mixed up in it now. I don't think you understand. This is not a game. You almost ruined everything. You've managed to save the day ....but only just. You shouldn't have kept me in the dark. You won't progress matters by behaving like that -- Are those your things in there? -- No. It's a debt. That's what you were waiting for, eh? Is there something important in those newspapers? Since we've reached this point, I'm going to tell you. But on one condition. That you forget everything I say, OK? -- Go on. The other evening I was gambling with a guy I'd already met once or twice. He gave the impression of knowing a lot about certain important people. People who're in the news right now. He talked a lot... but in the end he said nothing. -- And so? I noticed he always bet the maximum. Since what he had with him wasn't enough... ...he had to put something up as a guarantee. -- The briefcase? -- Yes. He offered it. And what else do you know? You saw as well as me what there was inside. At first sight, there was no connection... ...but I was certain that it was worth a lot more than it seemed at first glance. Why aren't you telling me the whole truth? Listen, Marie, that's the whole truth! I've got to meet someone about it. And I'm running late. I really have to go. Julian, don't treat me like a fool! It's the truth, I say! I really must go. Julien, what's happening? I'm afraid. Well, it's your own fault, Marie. Come, follow me. I know your name. Good day. Good day, Max. Ah yes, to be sure. Max. I am sure. Well, see you this evening. I know where he's going, I heard the address. Let's take the Aerial Metro. No, I can't, we'd better take a taxi! But the Aerial Line, it's just there. Breathe. "The Silence Which Kills" Marie? Marie? Do you see what's going on, down there in that car? No, I wasn't paying attention. What about it? His look. The way he pretends to be looking at other things. -- You can't miss it. -- I see nothing! Well, I think we'd better make a move because we're going to be very late. We can go that way. It's shorter by train. Who is that guy, anyway? I don't know him, but I recognize him. He stands out like a sore thumb. But no, that guy, he's just waiting, a rendezvous or something. He's waiting for someone who's late. Or he's not waiting for anybody. He's waiting for somebody to come or... Do I have to spell everything out for you? It's as clear as crystal. It's a Max. Max. A maximum of what? A maximum of Max? It's one of them: an observer, perhaps even a guard! We keep running into them: Marie, you must be blind. Look, another car has stopped beside his... The Max is being replaced We're being followed? By the cops? There's no point in running. They're everywhere. The ones in uniform.... Everybody sees them straight away. But, the most dangerous are the others. Me, I see them clearly. So what are they doing? Collecting information. Watching. And from time to time... they spring into action. This city is like an immense spider web... ...there's so many of them that sometimes they shoot each other by accident. I agree, there's no smoke without fire. But to go from that to imagining that... I'm not imagining anything. Those are the facts. I believe in facts. They're noting what we do, they're spying. They're observing us all the time! They want to eat us with their eyes. -- Sssh! Talk more quietly. We don't want them to notice us. -- Shall I open? -- Quietly. From the frying pan into... I was sure of it! Sure of what? That this is Julien's work, of course. And what do you mean by that? Since you want me to dot the "i", I mean: that this happened because of him. I have confidence in Julien. I don't know what's happening. It doesn't make sense. Love makes blind, Marie. Julien is perhaps not a Max, because he's your friend.... ...but even so, he is well on the downwards path. The least bit of suspicion and he's to blame. For you everything's simple, in black and white. You think there's a good side, all good. And a bad side, all bad. But the fact is, the evil-hearted, the Max's, are everywhere. Their breath blights everything it touches. And I say that Julien is with them. When I was small I lived in the country. The first time I cried "What a fine white horse!" ...and...everyone laughed at me. -- I don't understand. -- Me neither, I didn't understand. So, they explained to me... "There are no white horses, and there are no black horses. ...There are dark grey horses, light grey horses... ...horses with grey stripes, piebald horses... ...dappled horses, arabian horses, thoroughbreds... ...horses of all kinds and colours..." Isn't that how it is, Baptiste? In nature, there is no good, and no evil. We've gone beyond Nature. These days, it's a real disaster. In my opinion, Good means life. And Evil, that's death. Well... hurry up and open your eyes. The other Max! Poof, good riddance! But why have you kept that map? I want to know how it all fits together. So what's the explanation for that corpse? The Max had a bullet in his guts, that's the explanation. Now it's bedtime! I refuse to sleep on a bench tonight. Too cold. It's all the same to me. How about the all-night cinema? We can sit in front, that way I won't see the walls. Destiny is with us, Marie. Look what's showing. "Wide Open Spaces" THE THIRD DAY "The Prisoner" "Open every day from 9. am till noon" "Closed on Monday." "Open on Sundays from 9. am till 1. pm" It's really strange, this spider's web spread over Paris. No, it's not a spider's web, it's the lair of a great dragon Yes. Well, what it reminds me of... ...now that I think about it, is the Goose Game. Goose game? Don't know it. You don't know it? It's a children's game. A game of chance. These are the squares. There are good squares, and bad squares and trap squares. For example, the Tomb, that's a trap square. -- The tomb? -- Yes, the Tomb. Death. Death? But death can also be a new beginning. Begin a new game. But, in any case, it's a very frightening game. Do you want me to show you? How to do it? So there, that's where we were yesterday afternoon. That's the Tomb. Ah! I didn't make the connection.. Yes. Street number 58. Remember? 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63. There. When you get there you win. It's the end of the dream. Or treasure perhaps. And those squares there? What are they? Those ones? They're not counted, because the finish is there. Yes, yes. Use them to blur the trail. Deceive the enemy. I'm going to cross them out. And the other trap squares? I'll show you. 58, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. Ah, 52. The Prison. That's where I've come from. That's where my friend Mathias has to stay... until someone comes to take his place. -- And after that? -- One piece displaces another in this game. Then after that...you go on... ...till you come to... ...44, 43, 42. The Maze, very complicated. -- Very complicated. -- Yes. Then we go on... ...41, 40......33, 32, 31 You land on the Pit which is, the Horror. I made a mistake... ...it's not the Death square which gave me the creeps, it's the Pit square. I think my claustrophobia began when I was small and I fell into the Pit... ...and I felt like I was dying, and I think it's like that for everybody. And after that, the next square, the next trap square is the Inn... though I don't really know why it's a trap... ...an inn is usually pleasant enough, one can even meet Prince Charming there... ...and even... Total Rest... -- The Inn. And after that, one comes to, from 19 one comes to, square number 6... ...which is the Bridge. The Drowned Woman. -- The Bridge? Yes. These squares are always rather unpleasant. And then, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Departure. There. The Departure square. Sometimes you land on Departure after you fall into the Tomb, in which case it's no big deal... ...because you immediately go on to Departure. But that's the old style game, you know. These days, if you fall into the Tomb, it's for good. Because it's an old game, been around for centuries perhaps. And....the Departure. Wait. These aren't used. So I'll get rid of them. The Tomb, the Maze, The Pit, the Bridge, the Prison, the Inn. So to win you have to pass through all these traps? Provided you don't get actually stuck in one. Since the Tomb is here, and the Maze is there, we'll go to the Maze. Very good idea. That'll warm us up. Apple? A little something for the road. As usual. Look there. Number 42. Is that the maze? They've destroyed it all. Or else, see over there, they're in the process of building it. Wait for me here a bit. Paris is so small. For people like us... ...who love each other so much. Are you trying to confuse me? Or are you lost yourself? Don't worry about me. I always get lost. Me, never... I have my compass. I think it will work out, you can go. You don't know me... me neither. But I've already seen you. You don't, by any chance, happen to have a certain object which doesn't belong to you? I don't know what you're talking about. I think you do. The way you appear to me... you're someone well acquainted with disappointment in life. Do you think you're some sort of clairvoyant? I like to look at people. That's what's interesting, observing people. But I can be very discreet. No, wait. I have no personal interest in saying this... ...but I want to help you. You have a friend... He's about to make a mistake... ...a very big mistake. I'll give you a way to find him... Alright, corner: rue de Neuilly, rue de Port de Bercy. Good luck. Be careful. Hello, Julien. Ah, it's you? You weren't expecting me? No. But actually I wanted to see you. What has happened to you? Where did you spend the night? Somewhere warm. If you want we can meet up later. It's not a good time to run, Marie. I wasn't expecting to see you here... Now, it's your turn to tell me everything. And what do you want me to tell you? As I freeze to death waiting for you... ...to come, I don't know when. I've had enough of it! That's enough. I know all that. What, then? If you've got things to tell me... say them It's not the time to play games, Marie. In your game no-one is a saint, you know that very well, Julien. Oh, drop it. With your childish meddling, you've wandered into a minefield. The first time I collected the briefcase ...I had the money. It would have worked. But the guy wanted to check what was inside. And he got a nasty surprise when he opened it. Nothing but old tea towels. 40 grand gone up in smoke, thanks to you. I prevaricated. Tried to recover the situation. I had until yesterday to deliver the briefcase. So what happened, did you pick it or knick it? You can be sure I didn't. I brought him all the papers that were there. But it seems, that that wasn't the most important thing. -- What, then? -- What was missing. What you took. Are you accusing me? Marie, I beg you, give me the map. We can't do anything about it now, but we can lose everything But I don't have the map! Look! Look in my bag, search my pockets! We don't have the choice! It's my life against this map! I'm burned, understand? At the second rendezvous... he wanted satisfaction. He sent someone else in his place. And that one, believe me, wasn't a pacifist.. So tell me what you have done. I thought I'd get rid of it in any way I could. The last rendezvous is for this evening. Marie -- help me. I don't have this map. But I could try and get it back. You'll get it if -- if we go somewhere. If we leave this place. It's Baptiste who has it. Who's that? Baptiste? She's a girl who's attached herself to me. She thinks she's defending me, for me she'll do anything. You were always fond of gathering up lost sheep, dogs without collars. I don't want to know how you get hold of the map. You'll go there. I don't understand. You've tried to understand everything. Now do what's written there. Take that. I'm to use this? It's just as a precaution, see. Of course, you could always refuse to go. I'll go -- since I told you I would. Call me when it's over. And then we'll be together. "Inn of the Golden Apple. Way Station" -- See where we are? -- The Inn? -- That makes 3. -- Let's get out of here. Is that the beacon? Yes... the beacon behind the 2 cisterns. It must certainly be that. Now I have to go alone. You wait here for me. Hey, I'll go and have a chat with the kid. Day belongs to strength, the night to power. Pardon? "Day belongs to strength, the night to power". Where do I go now? Forget all that. Shouldn't I be saying that to you. Not to me, not to anybody! It's not your business to come here! What do you mean? It's because of you that I'm here. Don't you rather have the feeling, that you're here because of Julien? He always finds someone to carry his briefcase, that one. Julien and me is none of your business. What do you all have against Julian? For the moment, you are not my business. And I want it to stay that way. -- Well, then? -- OK. Listen. Listen. Marie -- you can do nothing. Forget Julien, forget him, forget Paris, and then -- "bye-bye" -- And go where? -- Far away! As far as you can. That's just what I want to do! Clear off to the end of the world. But not alone! Not alone. I want to go with Julien. And I don't want to lose him! As time goes on one loses friends from those years. That's normal. No, it's not normal. Not to lose them all! Not everything that you did then was wrong That's how we were before. We've done nothing. Yes. We've all been had, one after the other. Werner jumped from the acropolis in Frankfurt. Henrik killed himself in his cell. Maria Karrar smashed up her car in the Campo di Fiori... Go on! Continue. Go on now! That's enough! I don't want to go on! And you! Go on! Go on! You! I -- I'm still here, aren't I? I'm still alive. And you, you didn't have any questions? I'm not acquainted with your file. But the list: it exists. A certain number. And when they start to erase the names, they go right to the end. But your kind of messy affair... it complicates things for everybody. You should disappear. So be gone. Stay calm. You'll be able to sleep. It's all over -- you're saved. Another little drop? As long as it doesn't become a habit. I don't know whether I have need of you, but I think, on occasion... ... that you have need of me. -- Who knows? -- Live and learn! Who are we? Where are we going? Where do we come from? But, in fact, that's true. You've never told me where you come from. Elsewhere... Elsewhere? Elsewhere, that's a big place. Elsewhere-on-Maine or Elsewhere-on-Marne? Elsewhere full stop. Elsewhere-the-Geese? And what are you doing there? Nothing. I'm getting ready. You're preparing for... a life of action... ...and adventure? The old wise man of the mountains? It looks very empty. Ah, what a pity! Well, on we go. On we go! Well, we sure can't stay all night on this platform. All these buildings, if they didn't exist... ...if they no longer existed? All for what? There's the Big Bad Wolf, Mother Goose... The King of Cats... ...the old wise man in the mountains... It's a bloody zoo! You were forgetting? The lions and the eyes? Ouf, I've had enough of walking. Elsewhere...! I'd really like to go there... and for good...Elsewhere... Before the end. The end of the world. On my little desert island, like everybody. Oh, to sleep in the sun... in the silence... ...in my oasis... For me, it's a block-house. -- What? A Block! House! That's it, I've understood. The Game of Geese... it's for the ducks. What do you mean? Don't you remember? The end of the the game, square 63. That's where all the papers were, the files, the others... Those who're still trapped in darkness, who want to come out of the game ...they might need them, see? Big and small? Of course! Everybody! Big and small, good and bad, and at a certain moment... I'll explain... this is what you have to do, look! Much more satisfying than firing at shadows. Careful, Marie. It might be loaded. Marie.... Marie! I am Marie, full of grace, God is with me, in my place. And I am blessed among women! I am blessed among all women! Marie! I am blessed.... among all women! Ah! How tired I am! All the street, all the street, all the street! We'll have to sleep on the ground. It's simpler. Everything locked up everywhere. Here's the Night Hotel. Step inside, Madame. Shall I take your suitcase... -- Ah! Careful! There we are, Madame LaFee. Ah!... if I could be buried in a car like this. It's like the Popemobile. All we need now is a refrigerator... ...a telephone... chilled vodka... a television ...a soft cashmere duvet... a dainty pot of caviare. Let's sleep. THE FOURTH DAY Good morning. Did you sleep well? Ah! Is it your car? Yes. I leave in 2 minutes. I wanted to warn you. Yes, we're going. I didn't want to wake up. I had a big dream last night. Rich and strange. No, it wasn't a dream. The spider web: it was the Prison, Marie. Ah, yes. Perhaps. Let's count them. One, the Tomb. Two, the Maze. Three, the Inn. Four, the Prison. The Bridge. The Pit. Which do we choose? If Julien were here, he'd flip a coin. Which is it, our bridge? Bridges everywhere. -- Let's take the prettiest! -- It's not a game, Marie! I'll consult my compass. Look. This way, Marie! -- Look carefully. -- What is it? A dragon. Guarding the bridge. I have to vanquish it. -- Think so? -- It must be done. So that we can reach the treasure. And I have to telephone. Here, I leave my headset with you. And Baptiste! The maps. Leave them with me too. Oh thou perfidious dragon. Bifidious dragon! I defy you! Look at me. Guardian of the Bridges. I come at you with my bare hands. May the old wise man of the mountains be with me... May he aid me in this combat. Hear thou me -- and die. -- Hey! Why so long? -- Please! -- I vanquished it. -- Oh, good. I'm still waiting. Watch out, it's another Max. Hola! Out! Out! .........? Out. Hands up! Hands up! --..... Higher. --....... -- No speak French. -- In the air! Higher! -- I told you, hands up! -- No speak French. --............. -- Higher! -- Move your feet! -- No speak French. -- Hands up higher! Move! In the air! Baptiste, I must telephone. Attention! Gently. You're going to move. Gently. More. Shut up. Don't move. Julien, it's me. Yesterday evening I couldn't get the map. But I couldn't, Julian. You're going to turn. Now turn! Turn! Listen, I can't talk for long just now. Come as quick as you can. I'll arrange everything. Lie down on the ground. Down! Legs apart! Don't move. I'm near the canal. Quai de l'Oise. In the turn. Are you coming now? I'll be waiting for you. Baptiste! That's enough! One less. Where's the Pit? -- Hand me the map. -- Have you gone out of your mind? -- Why do you speak to me like that? -- No, nothing. Marie! Marie! Marie! Hey, wait! Wait a minute! I want to have a word with you. I don't have time! I can come near, can't I? It's a secret. I'm not going to eat you. I'm listening to what you have to say. Give me that. Your friend Marie -- you care for her? If you hurt her, you'll regret it. As true as my name's Baptiste. It's not about that. There are some people who want to harm her. Marie -- she's in a high risk zone. Me too! If you've come to tell me that, I know it already. You little fool, you don't see what's in front of your eyes. Your friend has been condemned, understand? Condemned to death. You're deceiving me. You're just trying to get rid of me. At least try and understand! She's played with fire before. Far too much. That hasn't been forgotten. Let me by! She needs me! She doesn't need you to help her. She needs you to leave her in peace! She's a grown-up. She knows what it is she has to do. Draw a line. Strike out the past. That's it. Start again. Start again from zero. Start again...clear the decks. Make a clean sweep. Marie, you're going to make a clean sweep It's such nice weather today. I don't know why I feel so cold. Here it is, as promised. I loved you, Marie. But it's... wait... wait for me You're not bad at that, you know. Attention... watch your head. Always watch your head. Well done, there -- go on, go on! Again, again. Don't look down. Good. Go on. Go, go. Watch out for the dog. You're doing really well. Go on. Continue. There. Very very good. Breathe, breathe. Breathe It's combat, but it's life. Have to breathe. Keep your face protected, OK? Doesn't mean you're disrespecting the traditional moves of the Katta. But -- take up the boxer's position, d'you see? Keep your face protected, OK? There, you made a mistake, see? Your mistake was to leave yourself open like that. This movement here is to protect the head. The hand inside, you see? Glide forward like this. You know the first Katta? At the end of the first Katta, you're like this, right? From there the arm moves bent towards the ear, see? Then here. And here. And never forget that Katta is a combat against imaginary enemies. See? And never make a move if you don't feel it's right. For example, this is very theoretical. But when one is here... ...holding yourself like this, an enemy comes from behind with a stick. From here, arm at ear, you turn.... and attack. Second point. But it's not a dance, see? Because you have a tendency to...you know? Remember the Katta was invented to protect against an attack like that... But no. That serves no purpose, see? Hand in front of the face. Think of yourself as a steel spring. Come here. End of the first Katta, OK?. Stand there. Start from there, right leg...Ready? Make a sound like that. It's extremely satisfying. Not bad.
