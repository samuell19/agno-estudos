But, that was nothing! You should've been at the circus. There were tightrope walkers, and acrobats, and even clowns! But best of all was... What, Ella? It was the magician! He made all the clowns disappear! I've actually never even been to a circus before. - It's true. - Hmm. Bingo! We'll just make our own circus, and we'll invite everyone! - Come on! - Huh? Ms. Berg, Ms. Berg! We're makin' a circus! Oh, really? You wanna join us? Oh, how exciting! You know, in my younger years, I ran away with the circus to Copacabana. It's gonna be fun to perform some of my old tricks again. What are you gonna do? Oh, you have to wait and see. It's going to be a surprise. Mom, Mom! Ella's gonna make a circus for me! You wanna be in it? Well, of course I do, sweetie. Jurgen and I can do a dance. Whoa! Ha! Kiss me, my cheri. Now, that's amore. Lisa and Lottie, we are gonna make a circus. You wanna join? We'll do a juggling act. It was my idea. No, it was my idea. - Daddy! - Huh? You wanna join the circus? That's a great idea. - Yeah! - Yay! Wa-hoo, and I can play my saxophone! Never had a lesson. Whoa! Wow! You are my best friend, Ella. Hi, Mr. Jackson, the stage looks awesome! I'm glad ya like it, Ella! I've been workin' hard! What are you guys gonna do for the circus, huh? You gonna dance? We're doin' magic. Fantastic! You wanna see? Uh, you know what? I don't think so. I'm just kiddin'! Of course I wanna see it! Yay! The magical Ella and her best friend and assistant, Henry... Ooh, I love Henry! Present the missing chicken! Oh, wow! I just need a volunteer from the audience. Thank you. Oh, boy, can I ask, is this dangerous? Where did my chicken go? Abracadabra, hocus pocus, ta-da! Where did my chicken go? Where did my chicken go? Hocus pocus. Oh, he's back! Oh, good! Oh, bravo! Oi, you're good, you're good. And tonight is gonna be even more spectacular! I'm gonna make Henry disappear. Henry? No, not Henry. That's dangerous. Totally! Everyone's so excited about the circus. I know, it's gonna be super exciting. It's gonna be super-duper, duper, duper exciting! We bought matching costumes! Mine matches better than yours. Let me tell ya somethin', kids. I've seen fun before, this is gonna be fun. Have you been practicing your dance? My dear, I've been practicing all day. Bonjour, madam. I was going to use these old curtains for the stage, but they've got too many holes. Bingo! What? What did you say? We can make them into costumes. Oh, yeah! That's a super idea. I'll whip out the old sewin' machine. Costumes made out of old curtains? - No, no, no, no, no! - No, no, no, no, no! Oh, no, look out! No! - Hello, there. - Hello. Yeah, I was wondering, can you help me? We're looking for Sunshine Gardens, number 26. It's that big house right over there. Yeah, you can't miss it. There, you hear that, Junior? We're here. Hey, there, I'm Johnny. I'm from the city. Hi, I'm Ella and I'm from over there. Cool. And, I'm Henry, I'm also from over there. High five. This is how my buddies and I like to do it. We are Lisa and Lottie. Actually, it's Lottie and Lisa. Nice to meet you guys. So what do you do for fun around here? Tonight, we're gonna have our own circus! Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Sunshine Circus. It's tonight. A circus? I used to live in Florida, where we have the world's biggest circus right on my doorstep. Me and my buddies used to hang out there all the time. What's he doing? Oh, that's Mr. Jackson and his chickens. They're practicing their circus act. You can do one too if you want. No, thanks, sounds like kids' stuff. It's gonna be a lotta fun. Henry and I are doin' magic! Aren't we, Hen, Henry? Whoa! Is that what I think it is? That's my bike. You have a Victor Supreme? Yeah, but it's an old model. Made of carbon fiber with Gyro brakes, 16 gears, and a tracking device? So you're a bike nut too, huh? I've always wanted a Supreme. Here you go, try it. Whoa! You want me to teach you some tricks? Yeah, that would be so fantastic. Let's go in my backyard. We can make a ramp. It'll be awesome! Okay. Henry? What about our circus? Pretty sweet, huh? It's okay, I'll be back. I promise! Oh, man, this is the coolest. I know, right? Don't worry about them, Ella. You can play with us. Yeah, it's gonna be so fun. Totes fun! Hey, it's great Johnny wants to stay with us while you're traveling. Johnny, say hello. Hi, Auntie, hi, Uncle! It seems like he's enjoying it here already. Your hair needs some serious taming, Ella. It is totally wild! Well, maybe I like it wild. Don't be silly. You're gonna look so pretty for the circus! You're gonna be the main attraction. Wow, that is exactly the style I wanted. Great job, thanks. Gotta get going, see ya, ugh! Oh, that was sick! Thanks, bro! - Great move. - Thanks! Wow, this is awesome! All right, Henry, now go for the jump! Whoa! Whoa, that was the coolest! Don't look so surprised, man. You're cool. Cool? No one's ever called me that before. Gotcha! This is so much fun. Gotcha. Boomerang! Ella would totally love this! Oh, yeah, I got a bunch of those. It's from Australia, mate. I lived there for a while, and then London, and then Paris. I've thrown it a thousand times and it always comes back. Look. Wow, you've lived all over the world! You must have so many friends! Tons of friends, millions of 'em, trillions of 'em, gazillions of 'em! Wow! So, where's the best place you've ever lived? Sunshine Gardens. In fact, it's the only place I've ever lived. I'm gonna stay here and chill with my aunt and uncle while my parents are working in Kuala Lumpur. Yeah, I could've chosen between this place and my grandparents' house, but I'm happy I chose this place. Me too. Whoa, is that? Yep, a real ninja sword. En garde! Wow, yeah! Hey, I thought you were with Henry. He'll come by later. Is everything ready for the circus? It's gonna be spectacular. I'm gonna get you! Bingo! Ooh, yeah! Here I come! I think we might be in for a surprise tonight. I'm planning a little surprise of my own. This is gonna be so great. Charge! Charge, I shall vanquish thee! Yah! Don't worry, it's me. I've got a sword, slime, centurion megablaster, and vampire teeth, too. So what do you say, suckers? Let's play ninjas! You don't look like a ninja, if that's what you think. Ella, come on. We should go help Ms. Berg with our costumes. Good idea, hmm. Wait, Henry! Don't you wanna hang out and play some more? I think you're right, Henry. We should go get our costumes. Sorry, Johnny. But I thought we were friends, Henry. Henry! You should come to the circus later. This reminds me of when I made the royal wedding robes for the king of Siam. That lovely man was so fond of velvet. Now then, the first costume is finally finished. This is for you, Henry. You look super cool! Yeah, I've been hearing that a lot lately. Hey, buddy. Oh, hey! What are you wearing, dude? Oh, Ms. Berg is helping us with the costumes for the circus. Cool, but not as cool as this. Come check it out. You go on, it's all right, my dear. I'll finish the costumes on my own. Whoa! Mom and Dad bought the brand new Victor Galaxy for me. Latest model, I'm so lucky. They always give me somethin' nice when they'll be gone for a long time. This has to be the coolest bike I've ever seen in my whole life! Yeah, and you know what this means. That's your old bike. It's yours, Henry, I'm givin' it to you. My own Victor Supreme? This is my wildest dream come true. Thank you so much, Johnny. Now, you and I can hang out together, like all the time. Henry we don't have time to play around. We have to practice our magic act. I have an idea. You and I can do a double stunt jump tonight at the circus. Yeah! The Fantastic Johnny and Spectacular Henry. - Yeah, that would be so fun! - Hello, Johnny. Henry is my best friend, and he's not doing a double stunt jump with you tonight. He's doing magic with me! Magic is just so childish. Henry can decide for himself. Maybe he wants to do magic. Are you crazy? He wants to do a stunt jump with me. No, he wants to do magic with me, and we cannot share Henry! You don't own Henry! He might wanna do the jump. Stop telling me who to play with! Henry, you do the magic act, or I won't be your friend anymore. That's it, I'm quitting the circus! Henry! Henry, come back! Please come back. Who's there? Daisy? - Dad? - Hi, Henry. I saw you racing into the woods, and so we followed you here. Is everything all right? You really shouldn't be out here on your own, you know? Shouldn't you be with Ella? Isn't your circus tonight? You two have a fight? If you don't feel like talking, just say, "Yeah." Yeah. Gotcha, made ya talk. Look, being by yourself isn't going to help. How about we go and get some ice cream, huh? Oh, what about you, Daisy? You want some ice cream? I guess ice cream makes you happy. Oh, that fart, oh! Aw. Are you okay, Ella? You look a bit down. Henry and I had a big fight and we've never even argued before. Don't worry about it. Lottie and I are always arguing. The best thing that you can do is say sorry and make up, even if you don't wanna say sorry. That's what I always do. No, that's what I always do! No, I do it first! You're both right! We are? I need to find Henry and tell him I'm sorry. Bingo, let's get all of Henry's friends and put together a search party! Yeah! We have to find Henry together! We have to save the circus. Are we ready? Yeah! I said, are we ready? Yeah! Ms. Berg? Jurgen? Yeah! Dad? Lisa and Lottie? Mr. Jackson? Sorry! The first place to check is Henry's dad's house. He's there all the time. Operation Henry is a go! Let's move out, team! Wait for me! I'm here to help. Thanks, Johnny, but we have enough people, so we really don't need your help. Oh, that's too bad. I thought maybe my GPS tracker, night vision goggles, and long-range walkie-talkies might help. Of course, you can join the team, Johnny. Isn't that right, Ella? Okay, Dad. Heads up. Now, we can stay in contact. Thanks. Okay, let's go fiend my buddy! Let's rock and roll, brother! Come on, Ms. Berg! Darling, I'm going as fast as I can! Oh, come on. This reminds me of when I was in a motorcycle gang in California. Oh, those were the days! Oh, I still got it! Oh, you're too kind. Ella, Johnny's a great kid, a real breath of fresh air, and it seems he and Henry have a lot in common, huh? I know something that'll cheer you up. Voila, this super swirly sundae with gummies. Okay, okay, okay, how about this king-sized sundae with double the caramel and four times the chocolate? Ah, ah, here's one you can't resist! How about a banana split royale? Ta-da! No, no, no, Daisy, no! Aw, Daisy, no! No one's home. Really great plan, Ella. Here. I could try calling his dad's mobile. He left his phone behind, but Henry was definitely here. I can see his bag. Let me see. So, where could he be then? The thing you have to ask yourself is if you were Henry, what would you do in this situation? What would you do, Mr. Jackson? I've got no idea. I'm not Henry! So where do you think Henry's gone, Ella? You're his best friend, so if anyone knows, it should be you. And you call yourself Henry's best friend. Well, ain't that sweet? Sweet! Bingo, I know where Henry is! Whoa! There it is! You know, I'm gonna check to see if Henry's in there. In there? Just in case he is. Henry doesn't dance like that. He's not old enough. No, you're never too young to learn Zumba. Excuse me? Excuse me? Yeah, hello? Excuse me, hello? - I can't see you. - Hello, right here! Where are you hiding? Uh, hello? Excuse me, we're looking for my best friend, Henry. Has he been here today? All right, yeah, let's have a look. Come on, you can do it, Henry! (inhaler hisses Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, of course I would remember him. I never forget a customer. There was something very special about him. I remember his curly black hair and his big glasses. He had a twinkle in his eye and such a wonderful smile. - That's him. - That's him! Yeah, I haven't seen anyone like that in here today. Aw. But there was someone that I saw here earlier today. He had the same hair and almost the same face, but it couldn't be the same boy I saw in the video 'cause there was no smile, there was no laughter. Not a hint of happiness. And I'll never forget those sad, empty eyes. It was as if all his hopes had been crushed, like a monster had eaten his heart, or his best friend had betrayed him. But do you... He didn't even want ice cream! Yeah, he must've been very sad. I mean, when you've given up on ice cream, you have pretty much given up on life, I can tell you that. Okay, okay, we get it, but do you know where he went? No, the only thing I can tell you is he was here. Sat right over there. Now, who wants to have ice cream? We have a super-secret special, Triple Chocolate Bomb! I shouldn't say, but the secret ingredient is chocolate. I'm sorry, but we only came here to find... We want ice cream and it's my treat. - Well, all right. - I want ice cream! We don't have time for ice cream right now! I want rum raisin, hold the raisin. I'll take strawberry. And I'll have some caramel. You got tutti frutti? Do we have tutti frutti? We have the most extraordinary tutti frutti you've ever tasted. That's what I call tutti frutti! Oh, like I say, I look great! But, Dad, you have to help me! We have to find Henry! We have to save the circus! Right, guys, Ella's got a point here. We have to go find Hen, whoa, that looks just like me! Oh-ho-ho, pecan and prunes, yeah! We're wasting time! It's not a waste of time if everyone gets ice cream. And he's probably miles away by now! You really don't know Henry at all, do you? He hates long journeys. Yeah, well, I bet I know him way better than you do. Yeah, right! What kinda bike does he have? That's not fair. You just gave it to him. Then what kinda bike did he have before? Um, it was blue. No, it was green! It was a blue 10-speed DBS Classic. Okay, if you know Henry so well, then what's his favorite ice cream? It's chocolate. Ha, mint chocolate chip! Whatever, same thing. And what's his favorite drink? Okay, you may have known Henry for a long time, but I have my spy gadgets. Bet I can find him before you can. Then I accept your challenge and the winner gets to perform with Henry at the circus. It's a deal? It's a deal. Okay, Ella, where do we go now? Bingo! He went to Tivoli Haven. Yes, next stop Tivoli Haven! Oh, hey, look! I used to have a teddy just like that when I was your age. Really? Here, watch this. I'm gonna win one on the first try. They all say that. All right. I think I had the sun in my eyes. Yeah, they all say that too. Ah, well, never really liked that teddy bear. Can I try one? Well, yeah, sure, why not? We have a winner! Yeah! Okay! So what do you think of the Red Dragon? It has 6,000 horsepower. Oh, and it goes from zero to 90 kilometers an hour in just two seconds, and you go weightless seven times. Wow, you know your Red Dragon. How many times you been on this? 56, but this is the first time I've ever gone it without Ella. Well, it's the first time you and I've gone on it together. Oh, not to mention Daisy. - Whoa, oh! - Oh! Excuse me? Madam? Sir? We're from Sunshine Gardens. We're looking for a boy. Have you seen my best friend? I've seen, like, a thousand kids like that today. Maybe he didn't come here. Yes, he did! - Look! - Huh? He was just at the roller coaster! - That's him. - Henry, that's Henry! Come on! We must've just missed him. He's gotta be here somewhere! I betcha he's over at the haunted house. Me and my buddies always love a good scare. Oh, Johnny! Johnny! I'll go with you. He is my best friend and I'm going to find him first. Yeah, you wish! - Wait for me, wait for me! - Wait! We have to stick together. Oh, I just love this place. He's my best friend, I know how to find him. Henry! Don't worry, we'll find him. Henry! Remember to look for Henry at the top! Oh, boy, this is really high! What? No! I can't wait to find Henry! Henry! Henry! Ms. Berg? - Ms. Berg? - Henry! Henry! Henry! Should we take it one more time? No, no, no, we should look for Henry somewhere else. Stand up! Okay, let's go check the fun house. Why do you wanna find Henry so bad? He's not cool like you. Because Henry's smart, and that's the coolest thing you can be. Is it? Of course, it's a lot better than being dumb. Hey, everyone's gotta pay! Keep the change, my man. Welcome to the fun house! You know why they call this the fun house? 'Cause it's fun! It's fun. Yeah, I got lost here one time, but I think I know my way out. Relax, Mr. Jackson, I know this place like the back of my hand. We finally made it out. Yeah, for a second there, I thought we'd have to spend the night. I'm gonna find Henry way before Johnny does. Then, everyone will know that I'm Henry's best friend. Then, I can forgive him for just ditching me. I thought you were going to apologize to him. Yeah, of course. Then, we'll have our circus and he'll help me with my magic trick, and everything will be like... Now, I remember why I stopped coming here. I think I'm claustrophobic! I'm also afraid of enclosed spaces. Mr. Jackson? - Hello! - Stay where you are! I'm going to find you! Where are you, hello? Mr. Jackson, I think it's this way. Or maybe this way. Or maybe not. Where are you? Ow, this place is dangerous! It was more fun with Henry. He always found the way out. You miss him, Ella, don't you? The magic act, the circus, nothing works without Henry! He's ruined everything! Oh, so now you're mad at him? No, not really. I'm mad at Johnny, with his new bike, and all his fun toys, and all his friends and all of his stupid money! All I ever wanted was a best friend, but what if Henry likes Johnny better? What if I've already lost? Do you really think that he's in here? All of my buddies love these scare rides! Henry's scared of the dark. And I am, too. Chill out, none of this stuff is real. I'll protect you. Where's Johnny? Johnny? - Johnny! - Johnny? Is it over? I, I musta slipped. Are you a little scared? Mommy! Mr. Jackson? Thank goodness, I thought I'd lost you. Come on, Ella. I think I remember how I used to get out of here. Really, how? Help! Come and help us! Ooh, Ella, I really have to go. The circus will be starting soon. You wanna stay a while? Can we just go home now? Let's go show your mom what you won. - No! - Ow, ow! I thought he might be in here. I'm havin' a ball! This place is fabulous. You know men can sometimes be very hard to find, and you don't always find what you're looking for. Out, out, all of you! This is not a chicken farm! And stay out! I mean, who brings chickens to a theme park? It's okay, Ella. You did your best, sweetie. But without Henry, I can't do the magic trick. And even worse, I can't do my stunt jump. Why don't you just have one of your other buddies help you do the jump? Johnny has been looking for Henry too, you know? And he has night goggles, a walkie-talkie, and some wristwatch thingy. Ah, bingo! Hey, I'm the one who says bingo. Why didn't I think of this before, my GPS tracker! It's linked to the GPS tracker on Henry's bike. It's on there in case the bike ever gets stolen. Let me see. Bingo! Of course! He's at our tree house in the woods. Hey, sweetie, wait up. Where do you think you're goin'? I'm goin' to the tree house! But won't we all be late for the circus? And I'm so hungry! Ugh, she's always hungry. Yeah, I should probably get these kids back home. But if Mr. Jackson doesn't mind, you can go. - I can do this myself. - Hey! Not so fast, Ella. You're all going together. Great, together. Just try to keep up. You try to keep up with me! Count on me! Never fear, I used to drive race cars in Monte Carlo. They never could catch us. - Make way! - Kids! Wait up! Oh, no. Oh, goodness! Oh, c'est la vie. You outta breath yet, Ella? Not even, but you're looking pretty tired. Wow, I love this. Downhill is fun! He's still there. Looks like I'm gonna win! Not if I get there first! Ha, you don't stand a chance! We'll see about that! You go the long way. And I'll take this shortcut! Oh, no, you don't! What a lovely day for a ride. Oh, a wheel, that's a, oh, why, that's my wheel! My chickens! Henry? Oh, well, there you are! Where have you been all afternoon? You had everyone so worried. Henry's been with me. He just needed a little cheering up. So you were with him this whole time? - Yeah. - You could've called! I forgot my phone at home. - I'm really sorry. - You would lose your head if it wasn't attached. Yeah, I know. You are hopeless! Agreed. Aw, you too. Ew! Oh, hello there, you big, friendly cow. Glad you're not a big, dumb, stinky bull. Okay, I'm just gonna go this way. This is gonna be bad. Johnny, Johnny, can you hear me? Hey, meathead, why don't you get me, if you can? Ella, drop your bike and run! Bingo! This way, Johnny! Johnny! Come on, Johnny! You can do it! You got this, Johnny! You can't get us! Hey, are you hurt? I'm okay. Your bike is ruined. It doesn't matter. It's just a stupid thing. My parents buy me a new thing every time we move. Maybe they won't have to buy you any more things. Maybe you can stay here at Sunshine Gardens with all of us. I'd like that. Come on, let's find Henry together. Let's go find Henry. (rabbit squeaks happily I'm sorry, we didn't find Henry. We looked everywhere. We even looked at the ice cream parlor. And Tivoli Haven. All over Tivoli Haven. And I double-checked, he's not doing Zumba. - What? - Huh? Well, you never know. Thank you all so much for searching for Henry all day, but he was just hanging out with his father. I'm really sorry I ran off and put everyone through all that trouble. Hey, it wasn't too much trouble, kid. It was Ella's idea to go search for you. Yeah, she's been making us look for you everywhere. She only wants to find me so I can do the magic trick with her. No, Henry, she wanted to find you because... Because you are her very, very, very best friend. Really? Oh, there you are, Henry! But where are Johnny and Ella? Don't worry, they went to the tree house to find Henry, but they'll be coming straight back after that. Oh, no! I painted our heart out in the tree house. What's Ella gonna think when she sees it? She's going to hate me. I have to find her before she sees it. Climb aboard, Henry. Let's rock and roll! Yeah, come on. - Ready? - Yeah! Let's ride! That way, it's quicker! I thought I'd never see you guys. Is Henry here? Look, it's my old bike. That means he was here, and he might still be. Well, there's only one way to find out. Is Henry up there? Whoo-hoo, yeah! You okay, Henry? Look out, sheep! Whoa! Okay, Henry, hold on tight! Whoa, whoa! Rock and roll! Wow, this is a pretty cool tree house. Ella and Henry designed it. And we built it together. I wonder why he came here. I know why. Oh my, oh, oh, no. Oh, obviously, Henry was upset. What in the world would you fight about, Ella? Well, I wanted to do a bike stunt with Henry at the circus. And I wanted Henry to do a magic trick with me. So you two were fighting over Henry. I told Henry if he didn't do the magic trick with me, then I wouldn't be his best friend anymore. But that's not the kind of thing a best friend says, is it? My chickens get on my nerves sometimes, but I've never talked to them like that. I was so excited about the circus, I stopped bein' a good friend. Now I just wish I knew how to do some real magic. All right, little brother, we're here. Henry! That's okay, Ella. You speak with him first. You are his best friend. Thanks, Johnny. Henry, I've been looking everywhere for you. I'm so sorry for what I said. It's okay, Ella. You'll always be my best friend, Ella, no matter what. I'm so sorry I painted over our heart. I didn't mean it. I was just really mad. It was wrong to make you have to choose between Johnny and me. You can perform with whoever you want to at the circus tonight. I don't mind, honestly. I wanna do magic with you, Ella. You're my best friend in the whole world, and you always will be. And I promise you that no one and nothing is ever going to come between us. And we'll never, ever, ever argue again. Ever, and even if we do, we'll still always be friends. High five? High five! We'd better get going if we're gonna make it to the circus on time. I made it all for you. Wait a minute. Where's Johnny? He was here just a minute ago. Where's Johnny? I don't know. He must've already gone. Gone? But gone where? Maybe he left so he'd get to the circus on time. Come on, kids! We got a circus to get to. The show's about to start. Take your seats, everybody! There should be a wire in here, I know it. It's gotta have a wire, and that's a... Ah, hello! Oh, madam and gentlemen, welcome to, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the incredible, most fantastic, spooktacular Sunshine Circus! Johnny, are you sure you don't wanna stay here with your aunt and uncle? Ella and Henry are best friends. I was only getting in the way. You'll have your own best friend one day, honey. You'll see. I'll just get my bike and we can leave. Allow me to introduce the first act, the fantastic, transatlantic, Ms. Berg! Ms. Berg! Ms. Berg! Hello, where are you? This should not happen. Ms. Berg? Voila! Oh, my, oh! This isn't on the program. Would you believe the bathing suit still fits? You know, it was given to me when I was in Copacabana. Why isn't Johnny here? I want him to see our magic trick. I think I know why he's not here. He's probably just playing with some other friends. Ella, I don't know if Johnny has any other friends. Johnny has lots of friends, I know it. He talks about them all the time. He's got friends coming out of his ears. Has he ever mentioned a name? He talked about a Victor. That's the name of his bicycle. I think he wanted us to believe he has lots of friends. But every time he moves, he has to start all over again. We might be the only friends he has. Johnny doesn't have any friends? I don't believe it. Are you kids ready? The spotlight awaits. I gotta go. The spotlight's the other way! Ella, wait, it's almost our turn! Ms. Berg, if you can't walk on a sidewalk, you can't walk on a tightrope! Oh, no, no. In Copa, I drove a motorcycle with a baby bear. But tonight, I'll just drive my scooter. Not the scooter! - Yeah! - Aw! Rock on! Oh, no, please come down, please? Just dance. Oh, that. Oh, wait, I almost forgot to put on my blindfold. Blindfold, blindfold? Lady, you're gonna give me a heart attack! Yes, that was just like back in Copa. Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Berg! Thank you. - Thank you, thank you. - Thank you so very much. Oh, my back! Johnny! Johnny! Oh, I'm sorry, he just left. Johnny decided he wanted to stay with his grandparents. Johnny! Johnny! Gotta catch up with them! And now, for our next act, the fantastic juggling twins! Lisa and Lottie! Yeah! Daisy! Johnny! Oh, Johnny, I just wish I could say I'm sorry. - Johnny? - Hmm? Johnny, can you hear me? It's me, Ella. Henry can be friends with both of us. It was really wrong of me to try to keep him all to myself. It's just that Henry and I have been friends forever. We know everything about each other. You and I just don't know each other the same way, so let's change that right now. My favorite food is peanut butter. I hate spiders. I love the rain. And one time, I tried to do a handstand, and guess what? I sprained my elbow. I admit, I don't really know how to play kung fu ninja, but you can teach me, if you want to. And now it's time for the wonderful Ella Bella Bingo and Henry, but first, it's time for me and my wonderful dancing chickens! Whoa! Thank you, thank you, thank you. Yes, we've been practicing that for weeks. And now, I wanna tell you that there's something else! And now, my favorite part of the Sunshine Circus, please give it up for the magic of Henry and Ella Bella Bingo! All right, here we go! Ella? Ella? Psst! What's going on, Henry? Ella still isn't here! We could do our juggling act again. Well, we've already seen you... Oh, baritone, huh? Oh, you're very, very talented. I don't think right now, we don't. Ella, Henry, Ella, Henry! Ella, Henry, Ella, Henry! Ella? What do we do? Well, it seems as though the show has come to a premature end. - Aw! - Bummer, man! Hey, here's Ella! Ella and her magical assistant, it's the Great Henry! Now, it's time for the magical workings of Ella Bella Bingo and her assistant Henry! Hello, everybody. The circus did not turn out as magical as I was hoping. I ruined Johnny and Henry's awesome double stunt jump. It's all my fault. I was just thinking of myself, and now Johnny's left Sunshine Garden. I wish I could do some real magic to get him back, but my magic just isn't real. Hocus-pocus, philly-ocus! What? You actually came back? My favorite's also peanut butter. Hey, Mr. Jackson, can you introduce us one more time? Yeah, we proudly present Ella, Henry, and Johnny, and here comes the, What am I going to present? Bicycle magic. Bicycle magic! - Wow, bring on the bikes! - And now, it's time for our final act, the most stunning and dangerous trick of all time, especially because we haven't had a chance to practice. This trick could go very, very, very wrong. I give you the Forbidden Box of Mystery! Mystery, mystery, mystery, mystery. Hocus-pocus, philly-ocus! Oh, no! - Where'd the kids go? - What? I made my two best friends disappear! Henry, Johnny, where are you? Oh, no, where are they? Where are they? I haven't seen, where did they go? Where'd they go? Oh, no! Oh, no! Now we have to go on a search again! Hocus-pocus, philly-ocus! What? Oh, oh, we found 'em! Oh, thank goodness, you're wonderful! How'd she do that? That's my girl! Yeah! Go, Henry! Oh, I'm just so proud of him! I am so proud of you, Johnny boy. Very well done, Junior! That was fantastic, bravo! Let's party, yeah! Whoa! Come back! Boom! You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? Yep, the only thing better than having one best friend... Is having two best friends.
