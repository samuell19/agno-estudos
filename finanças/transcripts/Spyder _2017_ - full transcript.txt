Dude, there she is. Wow! She looks stunning. How did you manage to trick her? You take her first, I'll follow you. Grandpa went to bed late. I see. He is my friend, Girish. We need someone to make the wedding arrangements and to sign the documents as witness. -Yes! -That is why I brought him along. You've brought along your jewelry and cash, -haven't you? -Yes, it's in my bag. -Okay. Shall we move? -Yes. -Give him the bag. -Yes. Vijaylakshmi, go and get a bottle of water. We'll wait for you in the bus. You can come in and sit on the ladies seat. -It is risky if someone spots us here. -That is true. Go. Superb! Here you are, ma'am. I hope nobody knows our plan. -Have some sweets! Ten bucks each. -Nobody knows. -Okay. -Ten bucks for a piece. -Sir, buy some sweets. -Buy some flowers. -We don't want it. -Buy flowers. Buy some flowers, sir. Aren't you getting married tomorrow in the temple? Have some. You'll feel fresh the entire day. We have two bridegrooms here. Don't you need flowers for wedding night? You are going to sign as a witness and then go into their room after he's done. Right? You made her sit in the seat reserved for ladies, right? You've made a foolproof plan, sir. Hey! Get out of here! Hey! Get lost! He is secretly planning To get married along with his friend He is secretly planning He is secretly planning He is secretly planning Dude, you said no one knew. Apparently, everyone at the bus stop got wind of our plans. Darn! To hell with your plan! I'm leaving. I'll kill you if you ever make such plans. -Forgive me, ma'am. -Hey. Where are you going? -What was I thinking? -What do I do now? I'll get going too. Here's your bag, ma'am. That was close. Their plan was secret. But everyone got wind of it because of me. My name is Shiva. This is my office. It's a 20-storey-building and has a staff of 840. Their rank determines the floor they work on. We have three more floors beneath the ground floor. A total of 30 work on this floor. I'm one of them. My work involves... Your work is all about call tapping. Are we allowed to tap citizens' phone calls? Is it legal? It is definitely illegal. Now, you must be wondering why the government is doing this. We monitor public activity for national safety and to maintain peace. If the senior intelligence team suspects anyone your work is limited to recording the phone calls of that particular person and forward them to the concerned desk. But, if done without proper orders or before the monitor beep alert, any phone conversation heard or recorded, will be considered a severe offence. That will cost you your job and you will end up behind bars. We weren't allowed to listen to public conversations or record them. But I only listen to public calls. I've even developed a software for this purpose. The moment someone threatens anyone on call, weeps or asks for help... this software gets activated, and my screen starts blinking. -When are you meeting me? -Come to the park in the evening. -Fine, I'll be there. -Meet me at the park in the evening. -Is that fine? -Yes, sounds good. Why weren't you answering my call? Yes, always! Seize the boat! We've been planning this for a week without leaving a clue behind. How could he reach us this far into the waters? Who is he? Boom boom sounds the tremor He puts an end to the crime Before it begins He's the scout that spies even in air He punishes the one who commits a crime The SPY is here Be ready, everyone Here comes the SPY To destroy evil Be ready, everyone Don't you worry He's the prince of Latika Have no fear For he's here to make you smile He lets no justice go vile One who faces him, faces the music Here comes the SPY To destroy evil Be ready, everyone Here comes the SPY To destroy evil Be ready, everyone He must've inspired the Marvels He must be the product of Hogwarts He must've inspired the Marvels He must be the product of Hogwarts This brave man Needs no theme music He gets the job done Without any hassle He plants the bomb of fear In heart of the fiend He plays with intellect He's the alter ego of triumph He discerns the sound of ants No germs bestrew without his consent Boom boom sounds the tremor He puts an end to the crime Before it begins He's the scout that spies even in air He punishes the one who commits a crime You won the national shooting competition. You developed two new software. Sports activities, IQ, EQ. You're over qualified in everything. Then why do you want to do this job? You only earn 40,000 rupees here. Besides the qualifications you hold, I recommend two other certificate courses. You will be posted on the third floor and can earn as much as I am earning. No, sir. I am happy with this salary. Your entire life will end behind the desk. That's okay, sir. I am here just for job satisfaction. My friend and my father had the same doubt. My father was surprised... that I am working for just 40,000. He said that listening to private conversations... is like peeping into a toilet when someone's using it. And that I'd make more as a cop. A cop finds out the culprit... after a murder takes place. He then produces him in the court where two advocates argue about his innocence and his guilt. Then he goes to the jail, later gets bailed out. I don't want to be a cop... who carries out all these formalities after a person gets killed. But, this job lets me stop the crime, even before it's committed. I don't expect publicity. I'm neither the Spider-man not the Superman. I'm not reforming the society, either. Had that girl gone to Tirupati... the other day those rascals would've ruined her life. I'm talking about Vijaylakshmi. I could at least save her. She thanked me from the bottom of her heart and addressed me as Brother. I'm content with that. I heard her voice on March 16 for the first time ever. It's 1:30 a.m. What help do you need at this hour? I was preparing notes for the Human Anatomy seminar tomorrow. Out of nowhere a video blinked on my screen -inviting me to watch it. -So? I clicked and watched it. What was it about? Remember, the chapters we read the previous year... about human reproductive... So what do you want me to do? Then a few more videos popped up in a row. Okay. What did you do? I watched all of them. -For how long? -Just four hours. Have you lost it? Just go to bed now. I am not sleepy. Only then I can go to the US on a scholarship, right? What has that got to do with this? I'm unable to concentrate on my books. Are you out of mind? Have some water and go to bed. I tried. Tried what? I tried to sleep but I am not sleepy. I am not interested in love affairs. I know those things will disrupt my academics. I don't need that right now. So, what do you plan to do? A complete stranger who doesn't even know my phone number. I won't ask him for his details or phone number, either. I need to concentrate on my books again. And you need to help me get this done. No way. How shameless are you! Stop acting naive. I know what you did. Clear your mind of any stupid ideas and go to bed. Crazy girl. Don't share what you told me with anyone else. You guessed it right. I went to meet her the very next day. A beautiful girl Caught my attention I get enthralled When she looks at me Is she the bubbly girl chirping on phone? Her looks differ I wonder if she's the one Yet, bloody gorgeous Oh, how curious! I'm Confucius Yet, bloody gorgeous Oh, how curious! I'm Confucius Thermometer reads the temperature Altimeter determines the altitude Fathometer scales the depths of oceans There's no meter to read a girls heart Hey! Follow me again and I won't spare you. Oh, how curious! I'm Confucius Darn! I suspected her. Perhaps someone is misusing her phone. Oh, how curious! I'm Confucius Is she the same girl Who I dream about? Is she same girl I am crazy about? She's also the naive one offering prayers Yet the smart brains at academics She is beautiful and she is carefree Seeing her weirdness I've turned into her She is Miss Mysterious Yet, bloody gorgeous Oh, how curious! I'm Confucius Why are you stalking me? Me? I've been watching you for 28 days. First day, you were standing over there wearing a Raymond's shirt. Next day you were wearing Mont Blanc belt and brown shoes standing right here. I didn't see you on Friday. But, the very next day you came to Inox theatre. I was sitting just rows before you. You looked at me eight times in two hours. You follow me everywhere on your red Enfield with registration, 9005. You better put an end to all this. That's all! Congratulations! She fell for you. What do you mean? From day one, she's been noticing you and your clothes. She even counted the number of days. She was sitting two rows ahead of you in the Inox theatre looking at you instead of watching the movie although you were sitting behind her. -Really? -Yes. This is your chance. Go and confess your feelings. But, I don't love her. Don't you? Then what is this about? We'll go shopping after classes. Okay? -Yeah, and what about lunch? -We'll have lunch outside. Look! I am not interested in love affairs. I know. I am not interested in love, either. Really? That's better. By the way, how do you know that I'm uninterested in love affairs? You'll go to the US on scholarship only if your score shoots up from 96% to 98%. Hey! How do you know this? Actually, I dreamt about you last night and you were in a problem. So I thought of meeting you and solving the problem. -No, there's nothing like that. -So should I forget everything? No. I mean, I need to alight from the train. I go to central library at five in the evening. You can meet there if you want to talk to me. Hmm. But, how do we talk in the library? We can whisper. All right, we can surely whisper. -Introduce him to me. -Um-hmm. Life was moving on smooth without any problems. But a phone call I received on April 30 changed my life. Why did you call me so late? Shweta, my family has gone to Vijaynagar. I am all alone at home. I feel there's a ghost in my house. I am so scared. I can even hear sounds from the roof. This is because of all the comic books and horror movies. You are hallucinating. No. Every house has got power supply except for ours. I am sure there is a ghost here. Please. Can you please, come over? My parents won't send me. Here's what you need to do. Lock all your doors. Pray to God and go to bed. There are no ghosts. Hi, Shiva! All of us met the other day and only you were missing. You seem very busy these days. You didn't even throw a party after getting the job. Renu, I need a favor. I guessed as much. You call only when in need of help. Go on. -Where are you now? -On my way home. There is a bungalow in the next lane which is 19th Avenue. House number 32. A girl is alone at home, all scared. I think she needs some support. Fine. I'll go there. By the way, do you know what Padmini did that day? We'll discuss that later. Please go and check on her first. Call me in case of emergency. Okay? Bye. Shiva, listen... That's it! Keep the phone aside and have your breakfast. Did you iron my clothes? I can't handle all the work alone. Why don't you iron your clothes instead of reading newspaper? Here's your lunch box. You always bring back the food back. An unfortunate incident took place last night in Ameerpet. A college student Hema... and a lady constable, Renu from the same locality were found murdered in the same house. Their bodies were completely disfigured and were brutally cut into pieces. This incident has struck fear in the hearts of residents. Bereaved families cried their hearts out... Police believe that lady constable Renu, who lives in the same locality, might have gone to check on Hema when she heard her screaming for help. Move! Make way. Sir, I know her. Sir... Hema... Madam, could you please come here? I don't know how to break this to you. We found their naked bodies backside of the house. They've been dismembered and piled into a heap. We are confused how to put the bodies back together. The officer said it would help us to assemble the bodies if women from their families can come and help us to identify their body parts. Can you please request them to help us? Their bodies have been cut into pieces. They asked you to identify the body -and assemble the body parts. -Oh, my God! My poor child! Why did this happen? Why did this happen? Why didn't anyone stop this? Oh, my God! Is sir there? Come, son. Uncle, do you know Shiva resigned? He resigned? Shiva. Shiva. What happened, son? Why did you resign? I am no longer qualified to handle this job. I got into this job only to stop crime before it takes place. Two lives were lost because of my carelessness. I can no longer do that job. A murderer was lurking in her house. She got scared thinking of him as a ghost. Had she given proper information this wouldn't have happened. She was just a young girl. She couldn't describe it, but I should've understood. I should've gone there myself. You've saved many lives before. This is the first time we missed it. There is nothing you could do. Come on, let's go to office. No. We find immense joy in helping strangers... and watching their smiling faces. My work gave me that joy every moment, every day. Quitting this job is the only way I can punish myself... for not helping those women. You've taken up this job to avert crime well in advance. Right? Let me ask you something. Do you think the murderer has never killed anyone before? Or do you presume he won't kill anyone after this? This is not the end. This could be the beginning of a deadly crime. Go, get on with your work. Get back to work with the attitude that you can stop crime. Go, son. Hey, scan this. Vinay, I sent her number to your system. Check her WhatsApp messages. You check all the text messages. Check for any suspicious chat messages, new friends, love, or any other threats. Hello. Hi. -I am so sleepy. -We are meeting, right? But I'm yet to finish the physics assignment. A new movie has released. We need to watch it. Confirm it. We will go shopping at Plaza. -Please come soon. -Study for some time. -I am waiting for you. -Let's go. -Please come soon. Okay, bye. -Yes, let's go. I had asked her to wait but I couldn't reach there on time. -Yes. -Where were you? Come on, now. Let's go. -It's a good movie. -We should watch it. Come outside when I call you. We will go together. -Yes, I am ready. -I'll wait for you to outside. Your brother won't create any problem, will he? Please. Could you come over? My parents won't let me. Here's what you need to do. Lock all the doors properly. Pray to God and sleep. There are no ghosts. Shiva. I was monitoring the Commissioner of Police's calls. One call seemed strange. You might find it useful. -Sir, I am ACP Sharma. -Yes, Mr. Sharma. Sir, I need to speak to you in person. It's urgent. It's okay. Tell me over the phone. It's very important. Over the phone... Don't worry, Sharma. Just tell me. Sir, we found a piece of cloth at the crime location. We sent to the forensic lab to find out if the murderer used it to clean the weapon. I just received the lab reports. As per the reports, the cloth carried eight more human blood samples apart from the two ladies' blood. Three of them are male blood samples. All crimes were committed in the same month with that weapon. I think this is an onset of a bigger problem. -Mr. Sharma! -Yes. -Do as I say. -Sure, sir. Come here with the records of all the missing cases in the city. Okay, sir. See you. -Another point, Sharma. -Yes, sir. Keep it confidential. Okay, sir. Strange! This explains that the murderer has killed even men. He has killed eight people! They found ten blood samples on that cloth. He might have killed many some more. If we find evidence in this case, we will be able to track down the criminal and find the number of murders he has committed. We are back to square one. The lady's whereabouts prior to the murder can be extracted from voice calls and messages in her phone. If we check the CCTV footage that matches the location and time, -we might find a clue. -Yes. The guy in the surveillance team on the third floor... Kaushik? Will he help us? We can give it a try. What is this? Such a long list? What excuse will I give them to collect the footage... It's very important, buddy. Please, help us out. We'll land in trouble if we get caught. Just help us out here. Make some excuse. Lie to them. Cheat them if you have to. Do whatever you can. An 18-year-old who didn't even get to experience life... And a newly employed constable with hopes to take care of her family... Someone murdered those two... stripped them off and dismembered their bodies. He kept their body parts together after hewing them. And such a man... is roaming out free. I want him! At any cost. And for that I need the CCTV footage. We work on level -3. I'll be waiting for you. That's the complete footage. We got footage from the mall, theatre, temple, ATM, outside the college premises, Lokhandwala circle, jewelry shop and the traffic signals. This CCTV footage is from filling station. Bye, Shiva. See you tomorrow. Look at him! I think he was here all night. Of course! He's playing chess. Dude, found who it is? Notice him. He is standing at the counter to take something. He's looking at the entrance as if he's waiting for someone... and that's when the girl enters and gets seated. He noticed the girl. He walked across all the empty tables and sat right opposite to her. She walked out with her friends. He ate nothing and walked out of there. He returned from the same door and followed her through the exit. His face isn't clearly visible. Now, check this parking lot footage. He's seen here, too. His vehicle registration number belongs to a truck. Got him! Should we inform the police? Police arrested two men last night... to keep public from panicking. They are old criminals. These details will only irritate them. And that will defeat our purpose. I will catch this guy myself. My name is Gauri. My brother is upset because I love a guy. He left home along with my college certificates. Brother, I will obey you. I'll marry the man of your choice. Situation back home has worsened. Mother's health is deteriorating. Please, Brother. Please return my certificates to me. Or else mother and I have to beg for a living. This is my brother's picture. His name is Krishnamohan. If anyone finds him kindly call on 9573040742 to inform us. I can find a job and take care of mother if I get my certificates back. Please forward this message to everyone. -Yes, Shiva. -Kumar. The video looks professionally shot. It'll look realistic if you could shake the camera a bit. I will redo and send it again. Let me know if you find it good. Don't disturb the setting. We need another take. -Do you remember the dialogue? Camera. -Yes. Brilliant idea! I can find a job and take care of mother. Please forward this video. I'll send it to you. Forward it to everyone in group chats. Spread the word. Use our servers. There is a chance that anyone who knows him... or who saw him might call us. It'll take a day, at least, for it to go viral. You need to go home immediately. You mom has been calling repeatedly. Stop yelling. That won't do you any good. If I sold it once, then it means it's gone forever. You can't return it. Just because it's online sale, doesn't mean you can sell a damaged iPad and cheat me. -Cheating? What are you talking about? -Of course, it is. I don't want this damaged piece. You need to take it back. Mom, I told you to donate it because the battery wasn't getting charged and you sold it online? Yes. Is she your mother? Shiva, do you know her? Please leave. Please go. Let's go. -It's their personal matter. -Go back to work. Let's talk inside. Give me the iPad. Be seated. I'll get coffee for you. Do you know Shiva? Yes. He followed me for 28 days. Do you love him? No. We are not in love. I see. You must be a friend then. Actually, not even a friend. You're neither his love nor friend. Then how do you know him? Actually, I... Actually, my score is 96%. I need 98%. He is helping... I like him. Yes. Let's see. Fall in love as soon as possible if you like him. I can't find the right match for him. He is extremely shy, just like his father. He was conceived four years after we got married. The rest is up to you to understand. My parents have been married for 20 years. -Yes. -But, I am 21. The rest is up to you to understand. I'm taken after my mom. You are too fast. He must be getting coffee. -There you go. -It's working fine now. Have it. Shiva, she says you're neither friends nor in love. She is right. Then who is she? How do I explain this to you? It's called friends with benefits. Friends with benefits? -Yes, Mom. -How? What can you gain or lose in friendship? I don't get it. Okay, then. I should get going. Okay, dear. Shiva, go and drop her. What? That's one benefit, right? Hey! That is so wrong. You go, dear. He keeps blabbering. Ciciliya, Ciciliya Let's kindle fire to the breeze Ciciliya, Ciciliya Let's begin pecking like woodpeckers -Ciciliya, Ciciliya -Oh, Yama Let's kindle fire to the breeze Ciciliya, Ciciliya Let's begin pecking like woodpeckers The strong beautiful girl The indescribable girl She's one of a kind The strong beautiful girl The indescribable girl She's one of a kind The strong beautiful girl The indescribable girl She's one of a kind The strong beautiful girl The indescribable girl She's one of a kind Hey, girl, I let you come close I forgot about the world for you My heart now beats for you I've gone crazy after I saw you I am crazy about you You made me fall in love I have only one desire To never break this promise Ciciliya, Ciciliya Let's kindle fire to the breeze Ciciliya, Ciciliya Let's begin pecking like woodpeckers Ciciliya, Ciciliya Let's kindle fire to the breeze Ciciliya, Ciciliya Let's begin pecking like woodpeckers Let there be no stopping I wanna fly away with you Your beauty serves me breakfast and lunch Floating in your deep blue eyes is dinner I am anticipating your touch I am crazy about you Ciciliya, Ciciliya Let's kindle fire to the breeze Ciciliya, Ciciliya Let's begin pecking like woodpeckers Ciciliya!

My brother is upset because I love a guy. He left home along with my college certificates. Hello, sir. I am calling from Kanpur. I just watched the video on WhatsApp. Can we provide monetary help to that girl? No, sir. We are looking for her brother. We'll give her work even if she doesn't have college certificates. Thanks, sir. But we are looking for that man in the photograph. -Hello, is that girl around? -Which girl? The one who lied about her missing brother on WhatsApp video. She lied? How do you know that's a lie? Don't bluff. I know the man in the picture is not Krishnamohan. He's my friend, Bhairav and he doesn't have a sister. Both of us are childhood friends. It's become a fashion to post fake videos on WhatsApp. Don't you have anything better to do? May I know who you are? I'm the would-be husband of the girl in the video. Just hang up. Where are you going? I'm going to Badlapur. That guy owns a medical store there. Hail Lord Krishna! Hail Lord Rama! I didn't know you're a cop. I thought it's one of those fake videos... How do you know that's a fake video? We studied in the same school till eight grade. His name is Bhairav. His father worked at the graveyard in the village of Mareda. In 1996, villagers came to know that his father murdered four people. A lot of events followed. But, I don't remember well. Who can give me the details? There's an oldie, Premnath who works at the same graveyard in Mareda. He knows everything. They lived in a hut there. Burying corpses wasn't their traditional business. He couldn't find work. Hence, came here. Bhairav was born right here in this graveyard. He left us! Who is his eldest son? Please, come forward. -Wait here. Hand him few coins, please. -What would we do now? Who will look after us now? Come on, hurry up. Who will look after us now? Put it in the pot. -Hey, listen. Wait. -He grew up in the graveyard. -His mother gave birth to another child. -Where are you going? What are you doing, son? Come on. Come here. Come with me. Leave that pot. So you want to break the pot? -You got scared, didn't you -Catch me if you can. Hey. Drink this. Son! What are you doing there? -Mom! -What's it? They are crying. They're coming here all in tears. -That's so sad. -His hearing ability is sharp. He can hear cries before any of us can. Bhairav, won't you go to school? Wake up, Bhairav. Oh, mother! Mom! Get that pitcher here. Have your dinner! Stop being stubborn. -Have your food! -Hey! Stop it! Why are you thrashing the child? It's been a week since he ate anything. -Ask him to eat it! -Shut up! Son, shall we go out and eat? There you are. Let me take you, too. -Shall I get something for you? -No, thanks. Let's go, son. Why hit the little ones... I've been noticing you for some days, son. Why aren't you eating? I don't like eating plain rice. I don't have a job right now, son. I will get some meat once I get work. Okay? I don't want meat. It's been a week since I saw people crying. No one in our village died for a month after that. Father had no work and Son had no appetite. That is when he committed his first murder. Here you are. Eat this after we get home and try to sleep. Okay. Dad, look there. Oh, no! Who is that? He is Mr. Rathod. Mr. Rathod. Somebody, help! Mr. Rathod is in epileptic attack. Help! Is anybody here? Please come forward for help! Mr. Rathod has got an epileptic attack. Please hurry up! Come on! Is anybody there? Hurry up! Walk faster. Look at what happened to Mr. Rathod. -Come on, guys. Walk faster. -What happened to Mr. Rathod? -Mr. Rathod... -What happened? -Please get up. -What happened to Mr. Rathod? -Please get up. -What happened? What happened to him? What happened? He is bleeding. Everything is finished! Oh, my God! What did You do? -He is no more! -Oh, my God! How did it happen? After that, he killed four people in different ways. Get lost. What did You do? Look what happened! A boy saw what Bhairav did. Young men of the village discussed the issue and came to a decision. Yet the deaths continued. Villagers were confused as to what was going on. Cringing with fear they consulted a priest. He said that the village was cursed because they killed Bhairav's family. Everyone left the village and settled at a distant place three kilometers away from here. They thought that was the only option. The village was in ruins. A few years back, a man from our village claimed to have seen Bhairav in Mumbai. Only then we got to know that he is still alive. Why didn't you inform the police? Because his family was set ablaze and the matter went to the court, that's why nobody wanted to risk it. Shiva, found anything? -Yes. -What is it? Dinosaur. I will send you a number. Let me know the location. Okay. Let me get that for you. Give me a minute. What? Sorry, sir. My phone got switched off. You said you saw Bhairav when he was a kid. But, what you saw on WhatsApp was his recent photograph. How did you know... it was him? Last year I took my family to Hyderabad. While we were at Wonderla park, a security personnel came and spoke to us because he recognized my father. Everyone in the village thought Bhairav was dead. But that security personnel asked us to inform everyone that Bhairav is still alive. That is why I recognized him when I saw that photo, sir. How many times do I have to call you? I've been after you from ten days. No one is here yet. When will they turn up? My manager is super upset. I need to see him. Go straight and take right. Okay, just give me the date. Answer my question first. Where is the guy who just came in? You asked him to go inside. So he did. Buddy, someone's here to see you. He showed me your photo in his cell phone. I sent him inside. How many people have you killed so far? We know all about you. Answer us! Who all did you kill? Why are you guys questioning me? He found all the details about me, didn't he? Why is he standing still? Why doesn't he kill me? Shiva! What are you waiting for? Need not take him to police. He doesn't deserve a life. Kill him right here, right now! Kill him, Shiva! What's wrong? He is not Bhairav. He is his younger brother. Imagine how cruel his brother would be. Ever since the WhatsApp video went viral my brother and I have been waiting for you. Bhairav visits me every day at 9 p.m. He must've come here today too and looked for me. He might have learned by now that you went around with my photo looking for me. He will definitely come here. You think he didn't commit any crime after he left at the age of 13? He never sat quietly ever since he returned. 2012 in Nagpur, a coach caught fire in Tamil Nadu Express burning 48 passengers to ashes. Do you remember? That was not an accident, but my brother's conspiracy. The following year, a bus caught fire in Hyderabad due to fuel tank explosion killing 37 passengers. Two years ago, there was gas pipe leakage in Chittoor burning down people. My brother was behind all these accidents. It gives us immense pleasure seeing people wail. That's not the end. My brother has plotted for the next ten years. Vinay, get me Shiva on the line. Shiva, it's Madhu. Shiva, hope you didn't harm that guy. We didn't. He is safe. Good. Get to the junction of Tank road. -Why? -Watch the news on television. There is no television here. What happened? You caught a guy, right? Our news channel received a shocking video this evening from an unidentified person. Let's take a look at it. I don't know where to start. Which murder do I mention first? I might have seen many of you before. If your friend or family member in this city was murdered under suspicious circumstances and if you cried your heart out... then I've seen you for sure. Because, I must have murdered them myself. I am just a medium to control the population just like the government, earthquakes or tsunamis. Nobody could trace me out until yesterday. But, today, one man... traced out my name, my village and the first man I killed when I was 12 and the recent one. He dug deep into the details. Now, he kidnapped my brother. I want him to let my brother go. Otherwise, before I speak of consequences... watch this video about a bridge. I joined the work when the metro train project took off. For every pillar that was built I killed one person and buried them inside. 23 dead bodies under 23 pillars. If someone is missing from your house... perhaps they are under one of those pillars. I will reveal names and details later. I wanted to reveal this information on the day of metro rail inauguration. When the entire city would be celebrating, we planned to watch and enjoy as the families in crowds wail for their lost ones. O God! My mom! My sister! My brother! My baby! But that man disrupted our plan. I want him to let go of my brother, right now. Or else, I will turn this city into a graveyard! A graveyard! Here are the details of victims. Pillar no. 17, Hanuman Rawat. 85, Srinivasa Rao. 130, Sudhakar. 149, Lalitha. 160, Mohammed Sayyed. Everything is over! Oh, my God! Do not cry! No one should howl! The one behind your tears is present there right amidst you. He is deriving pleasure out of your grief. He announced on television a while ago that I should let his brother go. This is his brother! I am the one who caught him! Both of them will go on a killing spree if I let him go. Not just the 23 people buried under the pillars that they killed. They've been on killing spree since their childhood. Now you decide what to do with him. Don't let him go! Don't leave him! Don't leave him! -Kill him. -Don't spare him! Brother! You are such a monster to enjoy other's grief. Now laugh out loud. Your younger brother is crying! Why don't you laugh? Brother! Don't spare him! You! Dare to kill me if you can. If any harm comes to me. my brother will turn this city into graveyard. Now that my brother's crying he will make you repent for killing me and you will cry a hundred times. We shall see. This is truly a crucial moment for us. All missing cases in the city are turning into a big threat. We got a clear view of what might have happened last night. In fact, we suspect more victims besides the ones buried in the pillars. If only we get our hands on him as soon as possible that we can stop the public from panicking. A common man divulged grave issue even before we did. He stood in the dark making sure no one saw his face. We need to find out his identity. Or else, the public will lose faith in police department. So, initiate an emergency task force. We need to find both, the murderer and the one who traced his identity. Truth always triumphs One thing is clear from the details you provided. They love to see others cry. They will do anything to get them cry. As per mental illness research... all human beings have this tendency to an extent. For example, we're traveling in bus we look out when an accident takes place. We get disappointed if no one gets hurt. But, if someone loses their life in the accident we feel sorry for them. That is what our minds hanker after. Normal people like us have 4% of this disorder. As per the research conducted in California, last year an increase from four to six percent was found. I guess such individuals arise when humanity grows cold. -Yes, tell me. -I am inspector Gokul. I need to meet you urgently. I want to talk about Bhairav. You saved my son from a kidnapper last month on the 16th from a kidnapper. Of course, sir. I guessed you must be dealing Bhairav's case unofficially. After confirming that through my sources I decided to meet you immediately. My higher officials received some information about Bhairav. I brought it here because I thought it might be of some help. You must be knowing about Bhairav's childhood. It is shocking to know the plans these siblings have come up with. He's targeted one of the hospitals in this city. He is planning to harm patients in that hospital. But what he is up to remains unclear. Now he's focused his rage on you. Of course, that is good in a way. Perhaps that's why he put the hospital plot on hold. The police department is trying their best. If you get hold of him, make sure you catch him alive. Because only he knows which hospital he's targeted. You killed his brother at the right moment. You managed to shift his focus. We don't know if he'd still execute his plans... or come looking for you. He will not rest until his plan is executed. We have to get him before that. My friend's not home. I took the keys. There is a swimming pool, too. Do you have any ideas? About what? -Get me list of workers who died. -Okay. I need a complete list. Get me all the details. You were saying something. Me, my friend's flat keys, swimming pool. This should stay between us. Sure, no one will know. Make four copies and let no one know about it. Text me the remaining details. -You were saying something. -I said nothing and you heard nothing. I don't need your help. Hang up! People enjoy on Facebook and WhatsApp but this man seems least bothered. His mom was absolutely right. He is not the right guy for that. Not at all. Okay. Yes, Mom. Shiva, aren't you coming home? You've started staying in the office. I have a lot of work, Mom. I will come home once that's done -Don't wait. -Okay. Come soon. Every house has got power supply except for ours. I am scared to be alone. Come soon. Okay, Mom. Every house has got power supply except for ours. -Mom! -What happened? What did you just say? Every house has electricity only we have a power cut. I'm a little scared, so asked you to come soon. -Why did you say that? -I don't know. I feel someone's presence in the house. I can hear strange sounds. Okay, Mom. I'm coming right away. Okay. Hello, Keshav. Keshav! Today's headlines as follows. Driver Keshav has been stabbed to death. Hello. Who is this? Where is Keshav? Shiva, what's wrong? Hello, Mom! Mom! Your mom is still alive. She is waiting. Hey! If any harm comes to my mom... You can't stop me. Why would you buy a house in an isolated place like this? No one will be able to hear her shrieks. She'll scream and fight at the first stroke and then, only the sound of dagger cutting deep inside will be heard. I will stab her in the stomach she carried you in. You want to hear that sound? Hey! Don't do any such thing. Hey! Hold on! Looks like someone is here. -Mom! Where are you? -I am here. I told you several times not to leave your bag -in the living room -I'll keep it inside, Mom. Do you have a brother too? Looks like he just came back after a game session. It'll be great to kill him now. Hot blood will flow out of his body. I will kill your mother and your brother and pile up their body parts by the time you arrive. Don't touch them! If any harm comes to them... What? Why are you stopping me? Do you think I'll stop if you ask me to? Okay, here's what you can do. Beg for their lives. Beg me and I will let them go. You killed my brother in front of two thousand people and now you plead in secret. You will find all your neighbors in your house when you get here. I will stand among them to watch you cry. "Mom! Brother!" Come. Link road. Hey, look at what happened. Someone, help him. Hey, look at what happened. Call an ambulance. Help him, someone. God knows what happened. Call an ambulance. Do something. Hurry up. The ambulance is here. Move back. Get aside. Careful. Careful. Sir! Please don't get up. Do you want anything? -Where's my mom? -Please, calm down. I'll call the doctor. What happened to my mom? Only your friends are here. -I need to see her. -Sir, please. You need to relax. I will inform the doctor. Shiva, how are you? Where is Mom? Okay. Shiva, take care! Mom, the main switch was off. -Is it? I thought it's a power cut. -Yes. Ma'am! I brought water for you. We already have enough cans. Someone called us to deliver here. But, I did not call anyone. Someone said that it was urgent. That is why brought it. Ma'am, the cab is here. I didn't book a cab. -Your pizza is here. -Pizza? -Ma'am, your medicines. -Ma'am, I brought biryani. Ma'am, I brought vegetables. Ma'am, the ambulance is here. -Ma'am, your medicines. -Water. Take the biryani. Ma'am, cab. Take him inside the ambulance. We could save them due the instructions you gave in the tensed up moment. Son, I've told you several times not to get involved in unnecessary issues. Now you landed in trouble. You had to suffer injuries. He has just regained consciousness. Please keep this for later? Vinay! What happened to him? Mom, can you wait outside for a while? I need to discuss something with them. Now that he knows we're safe he's asking us to leave. It's for official purpose, Mom. I need to talk to them. He will get more stressed if you keep talking. Let's go out. Please, finish your discussions and come out quickly. Come on. Let's go. Any clues about him? Did the police arrest him? We don't have any information as of now, Shiva. I'm sure that he is dead. No, he isn't. The shots I fired weren't fatal because I wanted him alive. I need to get him alive. Did the police enquire about me? They are ready to interrogate you the moment you regain consciousness. Both CBI and the police are upset with you. IB chief, Mathews called me three hundred times already. You'll have it once discharged. -Vinay. -Yes? -Will you do me a favor? -Sure. He fell off the bridge when I shot him. I need a detailed map of that river and areas it flows to. I need a laptop with high speed internet connection. You've regained consciousness after four days. Even if he is alive, I am sure he suffered more injuries than you. Get some rest. By the way, you have a visitor. We should go. Come on, guys. -Vinay! -She's waiting. -Hey! -Bye, dude. I am on a hospital bed with severe injuries. You're happy and congratulating me? I am happy that you regained consciousness. No organs were damaged despite the metal rod piercing through your body. Congrats for that. Did you check the reports? I don't need to see the reports. I looked at everything while you were unconscious. -You looked at everything? -Don't go overboard. Will you do me a favor? Sure. I'm waiting for you to ask. I need a laptop with high speed internet access. You've got a rod pierced through yet you want to work? -What are you doing? -Move! Move aside! My family is okay with our love affair. -Love? -Yes. Actually, I had no intention of... Anyway, what did your mother say? What else? She did not take me seriously. She said the guy isn't earning well and he won't keep you happy. Are you serious? I was just kidding. Get some rest. Kiss me and let me experience the sweetness Give me your heart, that's all I want You are my love, my life My heart beats for you I don't know when and how I fell in love with you A beautiful girl took my heart away A beautiful girl took my heart away -What's this? -My lunch. I am dieting. -Do you eat this every day? -Yes. Now I know why you're so energetic. A beautiful girl took my heart away I will let you kiss me I'll enter your heart With my stunning beauty You are my love, my life My heart beats for you I don't know when and how I fell in love with you I am yours and you are mine My life now belongs to you I only think about you now I am your darling My youth is for you Add some spice to my life You are the sky to my land I am destined to spend my life with you We will never separate I will let you kiss me I'll enter your heart With my stunning beauty Please, do You are my love, my life My heart beats for you I don't know when and how I fell in love with you My walk is enticing You will be enthralled by me My eyes will spell a cast on you Listen, beautiful I love you the most You have spelled a cast on me Let me tell you my wishes And my desires We will never separate Kiss me and let me experience the sweetness Give me your heart, that's all I want You are my love, my life My heart beats for you I don't know when and how I fell in love with you Sir, I am sure by now you know why I am doing all this. You can punish me... if you want to. -For what? -I need to catch Bhairav. Intelligence Bureau will take you in for inquiry the moment you are discharged. I will find him in two days. You can take any action against me after that. He is still alive. I will have to catch him before recovers. He has many more plans, sir. We will take care of that and we also have the police's help. We'll check with your doctor. Sir, you know that I have no selfish motive for doing this. Our lives will be in danger till he gets caught. I have time till I get discharged from the hospital. Allow me just two hours... instead of two days. It is 8 p.m. now. I will catch him by 10 p.m. So he says he will catch him in two hours. He must have some tricks up his sleeve, sir. Let's give him time. -Vinay! -Yes? -Pack everything that's in the cupboard. -Okay. Construction is taking place on the 11th floor of this hospital. We need to go there, sir. 11th floor, right? We'll be right there. He fell off the Chandanpur bridge. He wouldn't have made it too far. Dhobi Gali, Shankar Nagar colony... Diamond garden, Mehta nagar. He must've gone either to one of the houses or one of the hospitals in these areas. He must've threatened them and is perhaps getting himself treated. Staying in hospital is not that safe for him. So, he is definitely taking refuge in one of the houses. He might have fled from there in a vehicle. You're right. He would do that if he wasn't shot. But, swimming with bullet wounds must have drained a lot of his energy. and he must have lost blood too. He must've remained hidden at some place to get treated. And I am sure about it. We need your support because we have to find him without informing the police. We can get him right there... if the people living in the same vicinity help us grab him. What are you doing? This is a special meter. This will help us to find out which television program is being mostly viewed in these localities. Detective Didi is being aired right now. Almost 1.8 million people are watching it in this city. I don't think he would watch a television soap no matter which house he is in. Someone in his neighborhood or in the next house must be watching this series. We will request help from the ladies watching this series... to help us locate him. -Madhu! -Yes. Go and stand before that screen. Don't you have any shame? My daughter is getting married and you're creating a scene here! I want you to get lost right away! -Go away from here, otherwise... -Yes! You will have to bear the consequences. Give me your shirt. Yes. Here it is. What are you guys looking at? Get back to work. You are currently watching Detective Didi. We are going to ask you a few questions about this daily soap. Forty women who give correct answers will get a beautiful silk sari worth 25000 rupees. Another 20 women will get a 19-inch flat TV. The first prize will be a car. Interested viewers can contact us on the phone number given below. Please be ready. This contest is for women only. So, ladies. Let us meet after a short break. -Madhu! -Yes. We cannot risk channels cutting out this portion and confusing women saying there is no such contest being held. Go directly to the channel office and explain the situation. Shiva, this is unbelievable! We have at least 5-6 callers from every street. -Zee TV? -Zee TV? -Zee TV? Please keep silence for a minute. Sir, you cut short the duration of two minutes just to announce about the contest. Samir fought with Yamini and left. I wonder where he went. You are right. That is contest all about. Samir might be in your area right now or maybe somewhere in your street itself. This contest is about finding him. We thought this was about answering questions. Now you are saying that it is a contest. Do we answer questions or take part in contest? Give us clear information. -Dude! -Yes. She is too aggressive. Disconnect her. Everyone! Please pay attention. If your call gets disconnected... please understand that we have cut the call. We will call you back. Be ready. We are about to begin our contest. The contest will end in 20 minutes. What you need to do is very simple. -Are you paying attention? -Yes. -Yes, I am listening. -Yes, I am. Yes. You need to go to every house in your street... and ask them two questions. First question. "Samir got upset and left home. Did he come here?" Second question. Ask them quietly, only that person can hear it. "Did they remove the two bullets? Is he out of danger?" That's it! First question. Samir got upset and left home. Did he come here? Second question. Speak softly. Did they remove the two bullets? Is he out of danger? Return home with their reply, do not speak a word. This is first round and a very simple one. Every participant of this round will get an authentic silk sari. Redial this number once you're done asking everyone in your street. We are disconnecting the calls now. What are you doing, Shiva? Our participants are only women. Who uses them to spy around? Sir! You don't know about women. You become a spy after getting trained. But they are born spies. They may be talking to someone in one direction but can make out even without turning back... if someone is ogling them from behind them. If a husband is chatting with someone on WhatsApp they can just look at his face and tell if that's official or unofficial conversation. They have antenna, radar and censor in their eyes. They won't face any danger on their ground. Don't worry about them. Is Samir here? Did they remove the two bullets? -Who is Samir? -There is nobody here with that name. I don't understand what you are talking about. -I don't know. -What's this nuisance? -There's nobody here with that name. -Who, Samir? -There is no Samir here. -What are bullets? -I don't understand. -Are you out of mind? Shiva! Almost everyone has called back. -Yes, ma'am. -We asked, sir. -What was the reply? -They were asking if I was crazy, sir. -When will you send the sari? -They almost tried to hit me. Samir is nowhere around. In all the houses you inquired you must have got replies like "There is no one called Samir here. We don't know what you are talking about." They must've asked you what were you talking about. Did anyone give a different reply? Yes, ma'am. -My name is Manjula. -Yes. Please, go ahead. I went to a house at the end of the street and asked them the same questions. In fact, I know them very well. The moment I asked her that question she looked startled, asked me how I came to know and told me to leave immediately. Vinay! Mute the other calls. I don't want any of them to hear this. Can you please give us the house number? -You mean, our house number? -No, their house number. It is 28. The house belongs to a ward boy, Suresh. Sir, will I get a sari or a TV? -TV, ma'am. -We'll get back for the next round. Okay, sir. Listen! Take all these devices and set them in the ambulance. We need to get moving. There are ten members in that family. Everybody's cell phones are switched off from the past four days. No one has logged into Facebook, WhatsApp or Twitter in the last four days. No one has gone to work. Suresh, the head of the family, is 46 years old and works as a ward boy in a private hospital. Let's take a look at the house using satellite thermograph. Five are upstairs and five, downstairs. He's locked them up separately. We found our rat hole, sir. -Vinay! -Yes. How many people called from that street? Luckily there were seven callers. That's great! Call only them. Okay. -Please give us your names. -Sumathi Mohan. -My name is Manjula. -I am Akhila Motwani. -Padma. -Sandhya Krishnamohan. -Fatima. -Komal, sir. Shiva! Komal is in the very next house. Now everyone will be given separate instructions. -Padma? -Yes, sir. Please come out of your house walk to the fourth house to your right -and stand under the tree next to it. -Yes, sir. Sir, inform the local police stations and ask them to keep two teams on standby. We will need their help. Let's go to that area. -Hello. Is this Sandhya? -Yes. Tell me, sir. -Come out of our house. -Okay. You will find a mobile laundry wagon -at the fifth house to your left. -Okay. -Please stand there. -I am going, sir. -Mom, shall I come with you? -You stay home. Make sure no one knows where you are going. Till now I've been talking to each one individually. I am going to merge all our calls now. Can everyone hear me? -I can hear you, sir. -I can hear, sir. I am listening, sir. I am going to tell you all a truth. All of you are standing around the same house in different locations. This is not a TV program. This is a police operation. Police operation? A dangerous murderer is hiding in that house... right in your street. Everyone in that house is in danger. Police can save them. But, he will kill everyone in this house... at the slightest of doubts. You can save them if you do exactly as we say. -What do you say? -What is it, sir? You told us this is a contest and asking us to deal a murderer? Sir, I need to pee. So, will we not get any sari, TV or car? You will make the headlines on every TV channel newspaper and news channel. I am scared, sir. How can you hesitate to save a family in your street? -Mrs. Sandhya Mohan. -Yes, sir? You were a scout leader back in your school days. How do you know that? I saw a post on your Facebook page. Are you really scared? Do you think you're weak just because you're a woman? No, sir. I am ready. I am not just a scout leader, but the daughter of this country. Sir, even I am ready. People from Haryana don't back off. Tell me what I need to do. I am Punjabi, sir. I am ready too. I am from Hyderabad. I am ready too. Me, too, sir. You are their immediate neighbor, right? -Yes, sir. -Please, do as I say. Do you have portable speakers at home? Yes, sir. The one who was there will be here, too The one who's here can go anywhere The one who was there will be here, too The one who's here can go anywhere He's the first and foremost He'll be the last and final one Playing with the toys of human The ruler who is the only one The one who was there will be here, too The one who's here can go anywhere The one who was there will be here, too The one who's here can go anywhere He puts all his efforts siphons bravery He makes us strong He puts all his efforts siphons bravery He makes us strong Go to that house and ring the bell. He reminds us of the courage Buried deep within He'll make us cross even the river of fire He reminds us of the courage Buried deep within He'll make us cross even the river of fire You just have to jump. The one who was there will be here, too The one who's here can go anywhere The one who was there will be here, too The one who's here can go anywhere He's the first and foremost Do you remember borrowing sugar from me last week? I need it now. Please return it. When did I borrow from you? The ruler who is the only one Try and look inside the house. He balances bad with good He controls the vile He balances the bad with the good He controls the vile Quick! Quick! He is coming in. Make it fast! He draws sword as sharp as his eyes He'd even pull out the fangs of evil He draws sword as sharp as his eyes He'd even pull out the fangs of evil He is coming downstairs. The one who was there will be here, too The one who's here can go anywhere The one who was there will be here, too The one who's here can go anywhere The one who's ahead... Fast! Fast! He is coming! Fast! Playing with the toys of human The ruler who is the only one Don't be scared. He is coming upstairs. Quick! Move it! Fast! -Everything's fine, right? We caught him. -What is fine? You asked for two hours. It is two hours forty minutes now. Sir, we were not launching a rocket to count every second. This was the best I could do. Whatever! We will start an inquiry tomorrow. You seem more inclined towards taking action against me. But, there is a twist here. Move closer, I'll tell you. If you take action against me for disobeying orders in the Intelligence Bureau for the past six months... they will enquire you of your actions for these six months while I was going about my business. Sir, this is a time you can get a promotion. You know there is another guy in your office. He is equally qualified for promotion. He will land a promotion if they start an inquiry upon you. If you retire from job without getting promoted you will be paid low pension. A total of 14 million... You will lose out a total of 14 million and 36000 if you take action against me now. What he is saying is correct. Listen. Sir, needs time to think. Lock the door. I will suggest a way out of this. Tell them this was your operation, your plan. Crime rate has decreased in the past six months. Making that WhatsApp video, visiting that village, killing his brother and finally arresting him. All this was part of your secret mission. I just followed your orders. Everyone will praise you. All magazines will publish articles about you. You will appear on the TV and get a medal on Independence day. Say that this was all part of a secret mission. Just say that you are always ready to serve public. Don't say anything else. Do you understand? Do you expect him to salute you now? Hey! Don't be rude to him. Hmm. He is not an ordinary guy. Where were you all these days? Hey! My new car is amazing, right? Shall I guess what you are thinking? New car, new clothes and a girl who is sitting beside you. You are wondering what to do next. Am I right? -Shalini. -Yes. You know my name for sure. But you have no idea what I do for a living. You don't know how I found you and why was I following you, do you? -No idea. -Okay. I am going out right now. Stay with me. You will get answers to all your questions. -Who is she? -She is on my team. He is Shiva, the one I was telling you about. Yes, I've heard of him. I came to know that you were secretly listening to private conversations from the past six months. Isn't it wrong to hear the private conversations? Actually, I was getting bored in the office. I had free time. So... What?! So he heard everything that I told my friend on phone? Fine. He asked you to be here by 1 p.m. It's 1:20 p.m., sir. Why didn't you tell me? As if he has a watch to check. Just say that it is 1 p.m. How's your mom and Brother? Ask them to unlock off the handcuffs. I need to speak freely with you. Tell me. Which hospital are you targeting? What is your plan? You shot me at the right spots to keep me alive even when were about to die. Only to find out which hospital it is and what I am going to do there. It is not wrong for a living being to kill another one. That is natural. That is why God created others creatures to serve as food for some. Right? If it was so wrong to kill, then why did God give horns to a bull, venom to snakes and scorpions? God never gave horns or venom to humans. He gave us brains! Humans have brains. Human beings can find true strength if they use their brain correctly. The judicial system was created by the weaker ones only to protect themselves. It is a crime to kill a deer but it's not okay to kill a goat. Why? Is it because deer are less in numbers than the goats? Is it the goat's mistake that they are more in number? Humans are more in number on this planet than goats. What is wrong in killing them? Millions of years ago, someone killed a man and took away his wife. So, the others went and hid in the caves. When they went inside the cave, doors appeared. When they broke the doors open, locks appeared. When the locks were destroyed people took turns to stay awake and guard others. One started to rise as their leader. How did the civilization develop in the first place? Fear! Who created fear? Us! But, we have no fear. Don't you? Your brother screamed when I shot him. That was fear. You were hiding in the crowd while watching him get killed. That is fear! Even we know how to create fear. Don't think I will let you get away. Let's keep that hospital matter for another day. Right now, there is another impending trouble. Today, in another few minutes... Lanco hills... A boulder weighing a 1000 ton... Another small stone is supporting it to remain there. I appointed a chemistry professor and a physics professor. They are not worried about the thousands of people that are going to die. They just don't want their children to die, that's all. They will mix hydrochloric acid and water and pour this into a hole made in the small stone. That chemical mixture will cause a reaction... and turn the small stone into dust. Then what will happen to the boulder that has no support? Roll! Roll! Roll! That 30 feet stone will crush humans irrespective of them being Hindus, Muslims, Christians, kids, the elderly or people of any race. It will crush them and roll over them! Go! Go and save them. Saving the hospital is the final round. Go and stop this if you can. You need to be there at 1:45 p.m. You just have 40 minutes. Wow! You didn't get here at 1 p.m.? Come on! Let's move! You have just 25 minutes left! Wear the seat belt! Okay. -Get down from the car. -Okay. My car! As per the latest news serial killer Bhairav who was recently arrested has managed to escape from the police custody. He killed six policemen who tried to stop him. According to our sources, Bhairav's next target is going to be... a big hospital in this city. The patients, doctors and nurses in that hospital might be in grave danger. High security measures are already in place in all the big hospitals in this city. Central government has appointed Deputy Commissioner of Police, Ravichandran, who is a special squad officer, to control the situation. We are standing in front of the hospital. I am at the KEM hospital. Everyone here is scared. I am outside the Continental hospital. The public is in a state of panic. -Everyone is very scared. -You can see how scared everyone is. We can find Bhairav only with all your support. Till now, one policeman was assigned per block. From now on, every floor will have one policeman. Who is the CCTV camera surveillance in-charge? -Me, sir. -Don't leave your desk. -Okay. -Watch it carefully as it gets recorded. -Okay, sir. -Immediately inform police on your floor if you find anything suspicious. The situation near KEM hospital is chaotic, Rajini. Number of outpatients has been reduced. They are taking in only emergency cases. People are trembling with fear from the moment they came to know that something is going to happen in the hospital. People are requesting the police to arrest the criminal before anything untoward happens. City commission Kumar Ganpati has informed the city residents through media... that enough security measures have been arranged almost at all the city hospitals. Hospital surroundings are guarded by the police. Are you nuts? You are an educated woman. Don't you have any common sense? What is it? You have key to your friend's flat? Is that all? Can't you think of anything else? I didn't call you for that. I went to a hospital today as a house surgeon. There I saw a compounder crying and pleading with someone. I got suspicious and followed him. He looked exactly like Bhairav. I thought I should inform you. Which hospital... The number you are calling is currently switched off. Vinay! Where are you? -You... -Don't talk to me! You hurt me. Which hospital did you go to as a house surgeon? What is the name? Life Care hospital. General ward compounder, Ramachandran. Shiva, what's the update? I know which hospital it is. Bhairav is there right now. I will get him in another hour. -Which hospital is it? -Sir, please, give me some time. This news might go viral and people will start panicking creating havoc as he planned. Please let me handle this. Yes, sir. I know where your son is. My son is at home. Okay then. You can leave. Sir, are you a policeman? Where is my son, sir? Tell me, sir. Please. I take responsibility to save your son. First, I need you to answer my questions. How many is he going to kill and how? Where is Bhairav? -Sir... -Tell me! How many are targeted? -All of them, sir. -Everyone? Can you show me where it is? -Yes, sir. -Come on. What happened? What is going on? -Run! Run! -Run, everyone! -The building is about to fall. -Run! We don't know what is happening. How will I run? Run from here! -Run, everyone. -Mom! -Run! Run! -Run, everyone! Move! Get out of this building! Everyone! Move out! Sir! Please get out of the building! Run! Make it quick! Faster! Faster! Move fast! Keep moving! Go! Quick. Don't use elevators! Take care of your children! Keep moving! Go downstairs! Move faster! Quickly! Get out of here! Move out! Climb up! Quickly! Faster! Faster! Hold it. Don't be afraid! Careful! Give me your hand. There is no way out of here. How will we get out? Careful. Get up. Faster! Move faster! Move faster. Oh, my God! Come! Come! Come on! Yes! He will die! Shiva! Are you okay? Sir, would you cite Bhairav as an example to say humanity has ceased to exist? People are still humane. Just a while ago, some people helped me save many others... in this very hospital. But we start showing humanity only when a big disaster like earthquake or flood occurs. We are living in a fast-paced world... leaving us no time to even look at our neighbor. We're busy glued to cell phone screens, computer screens, and television screens. We act humane only when a flood strikes. We spend the rest of our time liking and sharing posts. Like the person next to you, share your love. We have a little sadism like Bhairav. He had 15 percent of it and we have only four percent. A husband vents it out on his wife and children. An employer vents it on his employees. Officials vent it on common people. Bhairav's death is just an end to one lunatic. The illness is still ruling. We are suffering it, too. Let's stop it before it takes over us. Helping a stranger without benefit... is what I call being human. Boom boom sounds the tremor He puts an end to the crime Before it begins He's the scout that spies even in air He punishes the one who commits a crime The SPY is here Be ready, everyone Don't you worry He's the prince of Latika Have no fear For he's here to make you smile He lets no justice go vile One who faces him, faces the music Here comes the SPY To destroy evil He must've inspired the Marvels He must be the product of Hogwarts He must've inspired the Marvels He must be the product of Hogwarts This brave man Needs no theme music He grabs ovation sans exaggeration He plants the bomb of fear In the heart of the field He plays with the mind He's the alter ego of triumph He discerns the sound of ants No germs bestrew without his consent Boom boom sounds the tremor He puts an end to the crime Before it begins He is a secret agent Who keeps a watch on everyone He punishes the one who commits a crime Translated by: Salonee kadam
