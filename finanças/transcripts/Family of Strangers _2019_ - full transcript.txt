Do you have any last words? All right. Take him down. He's alive! I'll tell the warden. OK. What do we do now? There is one case on record of someone surviving an execution. That person was set free. Present law states he stands condemned until the execution has been concluded. So we hang him again? Do you think the public would accept that? How is Kajiki now? The hanging damaged his spinal cord. He's showing signs of impairment. How about this? We say he died in an accident here and ship him off to another facility. Family Of Strangers Family Of Strangers Rokuoji Hospital —Good morning. —Good morning. (Buddhist prayers) (Buddhist prayers) —Good morning. —Good morning. Anything to update from last night? Kishi Misato vomited a little after dinner. I think it could be a side-effect of her medication. —I'll talk to the doctor. —Thank you. No admissions today? None today. OK. (Buddhist prayers) Good morning. It's 6.00am. Time to get up. Good morning. It's 6.00am. Time to get up. Please wash your faces, gargle and get ready for breakfast. Let's all get in line, all right? You're always so slow! Hurry it up, will you? Now you've made me lost count. You're so annoying! Mother said to drink 12 cups of water a day. It was in her will. You're not a frog! Here you are, Shigaki. Good morning. Shigaki. OK, good. OK, good. —Tsukamoto. —Thanks. You're going out today? Yeah, just down to town. Come back in time for gardening duty, all right? I will. Ichiyama Koji. Aged 81. Died of pancreatic cancer. The wake is held at Showa Ceremony Hall. Starts at 4.00pm. Chief mourner: His wife, Takako. Crafts Workshop Hide. Yeah? I'm going out. Do you want anything? Could you buy me two brushes? Sure. Thanks. I like that raw feel your work has. I'm just not very good. Here. OK. Two brushes? That's right. Got it. See you later. Thanks. Ten kintsuba sweets, please. Sure. Here. Stocking up again? There you go. Thank you. Thank you. Hey... Where is that guy from? Up the hill. They just let him out like that? These days, they are saying crazy folks have rights too. Shohachi. I bought kintsuba sweets. Hurry before they're gone. —How much? —300 yen. How much is this, Chu? That's 1,000 yen. It's so pretty! That's 800 yen, Sanae. —800 yen? —Sandwich board! You look like a comedian from the sixties. —This is mine! —I saw it first! —Hats? —The hats are all 500 yen. I'll pay tomorrow. New scrubs! This says 600 yen. I have to make a profit too. No way I'll pay for that! Don't buy it then. —Thief! —It's so pretty. You're the worst. —Tsukamoto! —Yes? How many times do I have to say this? This is against hospital rules! Why? They like it. I'm doing everyone a service. Do you want me to lock you in? OK, everyone, shop's closed. Let's go back inside. —Sorry. —Let's go. Shohachi... 1,000 yen is fine. Come on. Let's go. Hey! Stop it. Cut it out! She started shutting herself in her room out of the blue. When did it start? Three weeks... No, maybe about a month ago. Did you notice anything wrong before that? She won't talk to me. She won't eat. She has box cutters and all kinds of sharp objects on her desk. I'm at my wit's end. Are you being bullied at school? Yuki. What does her father say? He's a truck driver. He's away from home most of the time. Excuse me. Doctor. Ma'am, could you leave us alone for a bit? This way, Mrs Shimazaki. To the left. I have the results of your urine test. Do you know you're pregnant? This is your body we're talking about. Does your mother know? Shimazaki? Yuki? Yuki? What's wrong? Hey, Yuki? —Wait... —Yuki! Sorry about this. Yuki! Wait! Hey! Yuki! Did something happen? No! Don't! That girl who jumped was possessed by Satan. No. An angel saved her. She landed on a bush and wasn't badly hurt. Lucky! Lucky... lucky! It's good to see you have some fight in you but that was reckless. About your baby... the impact of the fall was too great. You need to cherish yourself more. Your mother wants you to stay here until you're in a better frame of mind. Listen up, everyone. This is Yuki. She'll be staying here for a while so I hope you'll all get along. How old are you? Cat got your tongue? She's 18. She's still a minor, so be nice. Come on... greet everyone. This is your bed. I'll put your things here. What's next? This? I'll go check over there. Shohachi! Take a picture of this. It's a rare medicinal herb. The pills they give us here are poison. I'm a doctor, I know these things. You're working hard. You're going out again? To my second son's. His wife is so nice. Followed by a Hikawa Kiyoshi concert. I wonder what I'll have for dinner after. Fire... fire! Don't panic! Stay calm! Don't move! It's all right! Calm down! Everyone, stay here! Shigemune! Let go of me! What are you looking at? There's nothing to see here. Leave me alone! That hurts! Let me go! Let go! Settle down! He smuggled in a lighter. That's arson. Call the police. Since it involves a patient the police will just let the hospital handle it. I don't want to be in here with a bunch of junkies. What will happen to Shigemune? Same as always. He'll just be put under observation. How are your injuries? My, aren't you nice to young girls? I look after the camellia bush you fell onto. It makes for a nice cushion, huh? What's with that crappy attitude? Have you apologised to Hidemaru for breaking his vase? All better now? For that vase the other day? That wasn't for sale. That's good. I want to go home. Don't wave at her. I'm just waving. What's the matter? Don't wave at her! There, there. Let's just sit down. It's all right... Just calm down. It's OK. —Tsukamoto. —Yes? You have visitors. What? I do? Excuse me. This is a surprise. How many years has it been? You haven't changed much. What are you getting at? You're saying I'm still crazy? No, I didn't mean that. How's Mum? Is she well? That's why we're here. Her dementia's getting worse. So we have something to discuss with you. It's not easy for her to be living alone in that big house. We're thinking of moving her to a senior home. Her life would be easier, for one. We could rent out the house but it wouldn't bring much. And it's no good for a parking lot. We could borrow against the land for a small office building. So you're going to deal with Mum the same way you dealt with me. —No, that's not... —Just leave. —Mum's OK with it. —Just go. I'll write to her and see what she says. —Chuya... —I said, leave. Chuya, do you remember when you first started having meltdowns? You do realise that we're the ones looking after Mum since then, right? And paying for you to stay here... till God knows when. Shut up... shut up! Chuya! Shut up... Mum, come back inside! Mum! Chuya, did you take your medication? You're ill, you know. Something is wrong with you. Get yourself cured. Shut up... shut up! —Chuya! —Are you OK? Chu! Come here. —Mum! —Get him inside! Mum! Chuya, it's all right! Shut up... Come on... Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Tsukamoto? —I said, shut up! —Let's go to your room. —Shut up! —Let's go. —Calm down. —I am calm. —Tsukamoto! —Shut up! Shut up! Tsukamoto! Tsukamoto! Tsukamoto! Come on, Tsukamoto! Come on. Tsukamoto! Doctor! Make way. Tsukamoto! I'm fine! I said I'm fine! Calm down. You can walk, can't you? Yes, you can, right? Tsukamoto! That's good. OK, it's time to clean up. —Thank you. —Thank you. Good work. Thanks. See that lump of clay over there? Give it a shot. It's cold! This is a weird place. The longer you stay the more you see yourself as a patient. If you have someplace to go, you should leave. I have nowhere to go back to. If you don't like it here why don't you leave? I'm not allowed to be out there. Good one! Great! What? Stop that! I'm just playing ball! —Calm down! —Get away from me! Shigemune, stop! What's that? Stop it, I said! What's wrong? I can't get back to my room. Oh, here you are, Mrs Kuramoto. You shouldn't leave without telling us. My granddaughter is taking great care of me. Thanks, Yuki. Yuki! Your mother's here. And your father came along too. What's wrong? No! Come on, play with me. No! Don't touch me! Let's play. —It's all right... —No! Your mum's working the late shift at the supermarket. She won't be back. Yes? Excuse me. Come in. Hi. —What's wrong, Yuki? —She looks fine. I think she can come home. Thank you for everything. Bring us a release form, please. Right now? Well, the sooner the better. This isn't a good place for her. A growing girl needs the right environment. We're not related by blood but family is family. A family should live together. —That's true. —Yes. I'll get the forms for her discharge. Please. Yuki. Don't make trouble. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. This thing makes a lot of noise. It's pretty old. Hey, Hide. Do you really still need a wheelchair? It's been years since I walked on my own two feet. It's too much of a hassle. You're just lazy, that's all. All right. Thank you. —Thank you. —Take care. Stay well. Come on. Hey! Cut it out. Please stop! Shohachi! Come on. Hey! Stop it! Mr Shimazaki, please! Come on. Thank you. Shohachi. Are you OK? Leave that man. What are you talking about? I don't want to live with him! Please! I'll go to school. I'll study hard. So, please! What have you two been up to while I'm at work? You thought I wouldn't notice? We live under the same roof. I thought I'd finally be rid of you with you in that hospital! When I get home from work I want you gone. I'll send you money later. Get out! Shimazaki Transport Who's there? What are you doing here? Mum knows. What you did to me! Mum's Mum and you're you. Help! Help! —What's going on? —What? What's going on over there? Nothing! It's nothing! Yuki... It's finally karaoke contest week. I'll win first prize. We have a secret weapon. Right? You'll be amazed. Will you be singing, Hidemaru? I can't carry a tune to save my life. The nurse says you sing very well in the bath. Must be someone else. Yes, I'll be right there. Ms Inami? What's going on? I got in contact with your parents. They say to keep you here for a while. You'll be fine. There's nothing to worry about. You'll be fine. Get some sleep. I can never bring myself To say goodbye Even now, you are still A shining part of my youth At exactly 8 o'clock I will board the Azusa train I will set out on the journey That takes me away from you I can never bring myself To say goodbye Please forgive me For leaving you this way It sure is easy for young girls to make friends. Ignore her. That takes me away from you The sea will part A road will appear Island and island Will be joined From here on Chindo To far away Modori 'O God of the Sea We bless you For the Yondon Sari festival We have but one hope Go and join them. There's a spot. From here I pray That we will Love again I don't want to know I don't want to hear Out of care for each other We'll just fall back on yesterday So we close the door together You suck! You suck! You suck! You suck! Move. You suck. Play Inoue Yosui. When I Was Young. Where are you going? Stop it! He'll kill me... he'll kill me! He'll kill me! Where are you going? Cut it out! —Where are you going? —Knock it off! What do you want? That was my vase. So what? Hey! I hear you killed your mother and your wife. They hanged you in prison but you were too dumb to even die? Come on, Shigemune! You should be dead! Come on! Settle down! Come on! —You should be dead! —Shut up! You should be dead! I said, calm down! Just ignore him, Hidemaru. Hide... You're early today. We can't work in this snow so we were let off early. How's your mother? She just lies there all day. I don't know what to do. Put her in a hospital. The guy from the Welfare Office said the same thing. I can't do that. Well, take care. Thanks. Missus! Keep your voice down. Scream like that and the old lady will hear. It's all right. She took her medicine. She's out. Amabaracho Ward Office I got off work early... Hide! No! No, Hide! No, it's not what you think. What the hell are you doing! No, Hide! You're a civil servant! What do you think you're doing? Hide! Oh, you're home. This is the scarf you bought me with your very first pay check. Who's going to look after you now? Mr Kajiki? Mr Kajiki? I'll give you a shot, all right? Hide. Hide. Easy now... Here. Thanks. Ms Yoshida to the Nurse Station, please. Hey. Nice dress, huh? It's all the rage now. The key, please. OK. Going out again? Today I'm going to my youngest daughter's. I'm jealous. Your children are so good to you. I'll bring back something for you. She doesn't have any family. She stays in a capsule hotel for the night and then comes back. The doctors all know. Folks in here are complicated. I should talk! May I... ask about Hidemaru... Yuki. Things happen to everyone. Hide. How are you? Sorry, you always have to help me out. That works both ways. For me? These will come in handy when I'm working. I'm embarrassed. They suit you. They really do. Would you like to help me with my shopping? Everyone says I have poor taste and choose the most awful things. Now you want help? I'll get you a pass to go out. Sure. I'll help. You want to come too, Hide? No, thanks. Not the way I am. Come with us, Hidemaru. Come on, Hide! Shohachi! It's OK, Shohachi. Shohachi. Come on, Shohachi. Dough cakes... Steamed buns. And sweets. These look good. How's this? How's this? Thank you. This, too. It's a thank-you for the sleeve covers. —Here. —OK. I think I might have bought too much. You'll just have to try harder to sell it. Yeah. It's been years since I've breathed air as a free man. I'll have to thank the nurses for this. Yeah. Anyway, let's eat. I'm tucking in. I'm tucking in. Good, huh? It's good. Hide... Just a minute. What is it? It's been a long time, right? We won't tell. Here. Go on. —Well? —Well? Is it good? I'm glad you like it. Shohachi! No... Shohachi! Are you OK? What are you doing? Not me. You too, Shohachi. Shohachi, watch out. Ashes? It's Ishida Sanae. Ishida Sanae She had been dead over three days when they found her. She died in a park by the sea. I heard she was born in Izu. Secret as stars Gentler than rain I can always Hear the voice Of that girl as she sings To my sad heart Wet with tears She speaks To my heart Wait, she says There is always a dream I guess she wanted to die looking out at the sea. But still, she ended up back here. Ishida Sanae. Aged 61. Died on 7th February. The wake is held at Rokuoji Hospital. I don't want to die like she did! I want to go home! Are we all really stuck here? What is it? This is the only place I have. Don't think like that. Maybe we could all leave together. Now you're being silly. No. I'm serious. I was thinking it would be nice... if we all got out and lived together. But maybe thinking that is proof I'm not cured yet. No. I'm happy that... you'd think that. Could you get a vase from the workshop we can use for Sanae's memorial? Which one? Something small. You decide. All right. Three, four, five, six. Hands and feet! One, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six. Arm rotation! Do you know Yuki's gone? No one's seen her since last night. What's the matter, Shohachi? Hey! What? Shohachi! Shohachi, what's wrong? What is it? What's wrong? Yuki? What about her? Shohachi! Stop it, Shohachi. Take your time. Calm down. What's going on? What's wrong? Hide, come with me. Chu? What is it? What's going on? What is it? Hide. What's wrong? Chu? Chu... Chu! Shut up! Chu. Chu... Chu! Chu! Breathe. Deep breaths... Breathe... Breathe! Slowly... Good... that's it. Good. Easy... I'll handle Shigemune. Don't worry. Don't tell anyone about this. The pictures... Erase them all. OK? What the hell do you want? What, old man? Watch it. You want a piece of me? You don't care that everyone hates you? You know they all laugh at you. What the hell did you say? You're a gutless coward. None of us here amount to much as human beings but you're the lowest of the low here. You son of a... Hide! —Hide! —Stay back! Please. Stay back. You're our saviour for killing that maggot. You did it for all of us. Hidemaru, be well. What will happen to him? I don't know. It's complicated. He has killed before. Come on. Do you still hear it? The cathode-ray tube is giving off strong magnetic waves. May I? Sure. I talked to Mr Kajiki's lawyer. So what happened to Hide? Because of his criminal history they don't know how to handle him. Where is he now? I don't know all the details but... he attempted suicide at a detention centre. I hear he's all right now. Hey, what are you doing? Hide made those! Why keep them when he's gone? No one wants them. Tsukamoto. You have visitors. Excuse me. You're looking well. Yeah, you're not as pale. We wanted to talk to you. Mum doesn't recognise anyone anymore. We're going to sell the house and put her in a home. Tomoe... I'll look after Mum. We'll leave the house as it is. Look after her? How? I'll leave here. Just like that? When did you decide? I've been thinking about it lately. Tsukamoto admitted himself. We have no right to stop him if he wants to leave. Really? I understand that you might be worried. But I can say there is no fear that Tsukamoto will relapse. Even so... This hospital can just get rid of him but we can't. Who will take responsibility if he leaves here and goes crazy again? You may call him crazy but have you thought about what's best for him? He's really motivated by the thought of leaving here and doing some good. Isn't it your duty as his family to support him? Should I really be leaving? Are you scared? Yes, to be honest. You can always come back. Don't force things. Take it at your own speed. And if that doesn't work out come back here. Come and see me once a month. I will. Thank you. Here. This is the number for Mr Kajiki's lawyer. Thank you. But remember, look after yourself first. Thank you. See you, Chu! Don't come back. Shohachi! Remember to eat right. Mum... Chuya? —Is that you? —Yeah. Mum! Are you better now? I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused. Azumi Law Office Hello. I'm Tsukamoto. I called earlier. Mr Tsukamoto. He's expecting you. —This way, please. —OK. Mr Kajiki doesn't have any family so I've had nowhere to turn to. How is Hidemaru holding up? How should I put it? He shows no reaction at all. As if he has no desire to live. He says he's a waste of tax money and they should just kill him. After the prison botched his execution they dumped him into the hospital system. I don't know if that had any effect on this particular incident. But no matter what his past is we have to await proper judgment. I've just come out of that hospital. But is there anything I can do? Do you know anything about the incident in question? Something that would suggest mitigating circumstances? There's no precedent for this case so to be honest... I have no idea how the trial will turn out. —Hey, Chu. —Yes? The head of Parks Department praised you for your good work. I'll admit I had my doubts when you first joined us. Maybe we should start sending you to more sites. —Good work. —Thank you. Thanks for your work. I'll do that. It's OK. Death Row Prisoner's Trial Begins Death Row Prisoner's Trial Begins Unprecedented Charge Against Convicted Killer Courthouse Ms Inami? Ms Inami. Why are you here? They're worried about Mr Kajiki. I asked his lawyer to let me come. Everyone at the hospital is on his side. But maybe we shouldn't have come? No. No. This is no place for us. It's all right. No one's going to give you a second look. Yuki? It's been a while. On to the next bar! Let's go! Hey... Hey, are you OK? Hey... Hey... What are you doing? You'll freeze to death sleeping here! Hey! Wake up! Forget it. Just leave her be. Get up! Come on! Hey! Hey! Snap out of it, kid! Let's go. Stupid girl! Quit wallowing! Leave her! You're looking well. I'm out now. —Congratulations. —Thanks. Have you talked to Hide? Not since then. I see. I'm testifying as a witness for the defence. I read about Hide in the papers. Go in. Sit there, please. Yuki. All rise. This hearing will now begin. Today we will have witness testimony. Please summon the witness. Please state your address, name age and occupation. Horimiyacho, Kawagoe in Saitama Prefecture. I'm Shimazaki Yuki, age 20. I'm a nurse trainee. What is your relationship to the accused? There's no rush. Take your time to answer. He took care of me when I was in Rokuoji Hospital. In what way? HIdemaru... killed the man... who had raped me. Objection. The witness has not answered the question. Continue. It happened... in the pottery workshop the day before he was killed. I was devastated. I hated that man. I wanted to kill him. But... I... I couldn't do it. My only thought... The only thought I had... was that I should just die. But I couldn't. I wanted to forget. Forget everything... about that day. And your family? I don't... have a family. Hidemaru is... sitting there in my stead. That should be me sitting there. If that man had gotten away with what he did to me... I couldn't have gone on living. Even before that... Hidemaru saved me. When I didn't know if I could start over he gave me the strength to go on. And so... I want you to stay alive. If you have to go to prison I'll visit you every day. If you ever get out... I will wait... until that day comes. Hide... Hide! Hide, it's me! —Hide! —Quiet! It's Chu! Hide! I left the hospital! I'm out! Hide! I'm out of hospital! I'm out! Take him away. Hide! Please! Hide! I'll be waiting.
