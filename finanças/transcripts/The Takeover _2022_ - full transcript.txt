NETFLIX PRESENTS [opera music playing on car radio] - [guard] Passport. - Good afternoon. MILITARY AIRFORCE BASE [sighs, clears throat] See you later. LANDING SITE ACCESS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN [music continues] [birds chirping] [music continues] [music stops] [jet engine roars overhead] [telephone ringing] [clears throat] [man] Buddy, good to have you here. We are in a rush. Yeah, that's what I heard. So, every Wednesday at three this place completely shuts down? - We lose all control. - Mm-hmm. It starts with the main terminal, we lose that one first. - Followed by the... - What time is it? [man] Fourteen hours and fifty-five. Convenient. Good. Well, hello, boys and girls. [all greeting] [grunting] Upsy-daisy. Let's have a look. Move this junk to the side right here. [grunting] Yeah... Here, and we plug this shitty cable like this. [inhales] Let's get these motherfuckers. Yes, this is going well. But not well enough. And next... [keyboard clacking] Five, four, three, two... [beeps] [silence] [powering up sound] - [computers beeping] - [woman] I'm out. I'm out. - Here as well. - Everything's down here. - There is a breach in terminal four. - Hmm. [woman 2] Storage South is being attacked. And five, unit five is going down. [Buddy] Everything is down, guys. [Buddy typing furiously] [chuckles] [continues typing] - [man] So? - [woman] Anything? Uh... We are just going back a little... to see where they are coming from this time. I'll give you three guesses. - Moscow? - No. - Belarus? - [Buddy] Uh-uh. - North Korea? - Almost there. [computer beeps] - Spijkenisse. - [all] What? [beeping steadily] [children laughing] [tense music playing] POLICE ARREST TEAM [music stops] Police! Stay where you are! Do not move. [computer beeping steadily] - Oops. - [beeping stops] Well, yes, indeed, "oops." You're not a room full of Russians. How old are you? Twelve? Thirteen? Sixteen. Hmm. How long have you been at this? That's none of your business. Can you give us a minute? [sighing] So I'll guess I'll start. I am Buddy. Buddy Benschot. Buddy Benschot? The hacker? This is a terrible book. I wouldn't read this. HELPING HACKERS Why are you working for the police? Why are you shutting down an air force base every week? Why not? Have you heard the noise coming from those jets? They chase away all the seals. So you are doing all of this for the seals? Yeah. And? That's a lot of work for some seals. It's not that hard. I think the Russians would disagree with you. How did you manage this? [computer beeps steadily] How did you find me? If you tell me how you did this, I'll tell you how I found you. [officer] Buddy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But those men would like to talk with you first. Deal. [upbeat rhythmic music playing] TEN YEARS LATER... [music fades] [woman 3] We all know that infrastructure is the future. 5G, blockchain technology, satellites... Undoubtedly, all of these are already in your stock portfolio. But don't forget, Rotterdam alone has 270,000 public transit movements every day. And who's best at capitalizing on this? According to Rotramax, that would be us, with this self-driving, guided, autonomous bus, with our state-of-the-art face recognition software, safety and secure payments are guaranteed. Convenient for both travelers and for stakeholders. Thank you. Eurocode detection? Right. Mel Bandison, the last software check before the European certification. Linde van Erp. CEO. Well, here it is. The first self-driving bus in the Netherlands. I've only seen the inside. The software. Yeah, yeah. After this, you're all set for launch. I'll get someone to take you there. - [knocking] - Lisa! Here it is. [door shuts] [bag unzipping] [computer fans whirring softly] [call ringing] Mel, I'm sorry. Am I way too late? Let's... Yes, here it is. Yeah. I'm here. Plugging into the mainframe. Getting a taxi in London at four o'clock in the afternoon is fucking impossible. Oh, nice. [cork popping] So, I was thinking... Your date tonight, remember? Is it wise to go straight to a guy's house like that? It's fun, right? And he's supposed to be a really good cook. [laughs] Come on now. The first date at someone's house. Don't you know how many creeps are out there? He's not a creep. Look at him! Bring it closer, I can't see it. Okay, that's not a creep. And he's great with vegetables. [Richelle laughing] By the way, a picture means nothing. It could be anyone in that picture. Well, I think it's probably not that bad. I think he's very cute. [keyboard clacking] [swirling computer noises] [Richelle echoing] Mel. - Mel. - [noises fade] - Look at this. - [Richelle] Yes? - That's weird. - What? - Check this out. - What is this? This is not supposed to be here. Maybe there was a leak? How could we have missed that? A pipeline has been put in, that's how they're funneling the data out. [sighs] The team has been working on this for over three months. I don't get it. Jesus. [laughs] Can you fix it? Not tonight. Maybe it's a sign you should cancel your date. [keyboard clacking] I am sending a Trojan horse. That'll block them for a while, at least. Problem solved. Fuck. - Can you override it? - I don't know. Everything's down. It's coming from Rotterdam. The Rotramax setup. - Someone was in the software. - Fuck. We need to know who. [doorbell ringing] [soul music playing on speakers] Hey. You made it. Welcome. Hi. Thomas. - Mel. - Great. Come in. Do you want to drink something? Beer? Uh, yeah. Oh... You, uh, you work with computers, right? Yeah. I check software for errors. [doorbell ringing] Oh, sorry. Um, the food is here. I'll be right back. - [man] Your delivery. - [Thomas] Ah, amazing. Everything is in it? Spring rolls, sauce? - [man] All in the bag. - [Thomas] Amazing, thank you, dude! - [man] Thank you. Enjoy your meal. - [Thomas] Bye! [man] Bye-bye. [door closes] - [Mel] Mm. - [sighs] - [soul music playing] - [loud slurping] [slurping] So? Incredible, right? Seriously, this is the third-best Chinese restaurant in Rotterdam. Just around the corner. Do you know what I always do? Kind of my own invention, but it tastes really good. I dunk my spring rolls in the wonton soup. Really? Yeah. Yeah, okay, you lose the crispiness, I understand. But instead you get this... [imitates explosion] huge flavor explosion. Just try it. Oh, uh... - Huh? - Uh, no. - It's fucking delicious. - Sorry, I'm good. - Oh, come on, try it. - I don't want it! Okay. If you never try a good thing... [crunching] ...you don't know what you'll miss. I... I'm gonna... [sighs] Hey, I, uh, I really enjoyed hanging with you but I just got an emergency message. Really sad, I have to go. - Sorry. - Huh? Really? Okay. Bye. OMG... CHINESE TAKEAWAY!!! [grunting] [phone chimes] Hacking this company is so easy. He uses the same password for everything. Oh my God, the idiot. Hey, let's get this fucker, okay. Oh, no. He just made a new deal to dump four tons of toxic waste in the river. [Mel] Jesus. Okay, let's do this. Jay, are you in his home network? Almost, yeah. - Yu, you've got his company network? - Of course. [Mel] Okay. Camera on. Yu, turn on computers. Jay, did you do what I asked you to do? Oui, oui. Hacked all his computers, emptied his credit cards, and sent his crypto to charity. - His mortgage? - [Jay] I fucked up his mortgage too. Mel, do you want to do the honors? [all laughing] [Yu] Another one down. [Jay] Great work, guys. Okay, next. [Yu] So, guys, I found this fucking guy. And he's laundering money for... [chuckles] [Yu] Perfect. We can hack him, like, in a day. Less! So... [computer beeps] [automated voice] Warning, front door. [computer beeps] [automated voice] Warning, front door. [door creaks] [gasps softly] [panting] [intruder] It's her. Let's go. You see anything? Fuck. [intense music playing] - Where? - This way. Come on. No! That way. Go! - [panting] - Go! Come on! [music continues] [car engine revs] [brakes squeal] [horn honks] [panting] [music fades] We lost her, sir. That's not good is it, Stevens? Find her again. [distant sirens wailing] Did you get it? [woman] Yes, we got it. - Make the preparations. - Okay, sir. Let's do it. [intense computer sounds] [suspenseful music playing] [telephone ringing] Hi, how much longer? Uh, less than five minutes. [sighs impatiently] Oh, Jesus. Miss Bandison? Dries Daoudi. You're shocked? Yeah, shocked. Here you go. Do you know what they were looking for? What they wanted? Were they burglars, uh... were they looking for something they hoped to find at your place? Says here that you work as a hacker. No, I shouldn't have said that. I'm working for a European company, I protect... I have to ask you to remain seated. Two men entered your house with your photo. Obviously they were looking for you. Yeah. So they did that for a reason. [cell phone buzzing] We sent a car to your apartment. I'll ask if they found something. After that I'll get back to you. [sighs] [door closes] [indistinct chatter] [Mel gasps] [laughing] [breathing heavily] [man] Look, we found this on her wall. - Some kind of revenge. - Fuck. [tense music playing] [music continues] [music fades] [gasps softly] [cell phone chimes] THOMAS PLEASE PAY ME €11.80 FOR 'CHINESE' Fuck. [tense music continues] Psst! [car starts] [knocking] [doorbell rings] Hey! [doorbell rings] Hey! - Hey, Mel. - Hey. You're here to pay? Sorry for yesterday. Can I hide here? Hiding? Wait, from what? Hello? Um... Okay. I was just leaving. - Another emergency, I assume? - I don't know. Um... Okay. - Sorry. Something is wrong. - [cell phone ringing] Are you serious? I'm being followed by two men. - I was at the police station... - What? The police? [Mel] Jay. Hey Mel, ça va? What's going on? Some guys are after me. I think it's to do with last night. - What? Jesus. You okay? - [doorbell rings] - [loud banging] - Fuck. Thomas, don't! Jay, find out if we fucked with the wrong guys. Did we miss something? Who are those guys? I don't know who they are. I did something and they want to talk to me. - But maybe you should... - Are there other exits? - Obviously, he thinks that it... Ah! - [gunshot] - Ah! Ah! - [gunshots] [yells] Fuck! - [Thomas] Oh my God, what the fuck? - [men yelling] [intense music playing] [grunts] Let's go the other way! [Mel] Go. [intense music continues] Hey. Come on. [music stops] [panting] What now? What do we do now? - Let me think. - Yeah. Oh fuck. It's my phone. Shit. [banging] Okay. Come on. [dog barking in distance] Here. [Thomas] Okay. This has been a very exciting date and all, but I think that this is the right moment to go to the police. No. I've already been there. Those guys walked into the police station and nobody stopped them. I really need to figure out what's going on here. And... and what should I do? If I were you I would stay hiding. - But... - They know where you live, Thomas. They have guns. And they know you know me. I... I... I don't know you at all. I mean, you just came over to my place for a bad date. That's all. - I have nothing to do with you. - You're right. You have nothing to do with me. [woman on TV] ...an incident of shocking violence in the center of the city. We are hoping that with your help, we can find the suspect, Mel B, as quickly as possible. Out of the blue, the suspect and an unidentified victim were standing eye-to-eye in the remote corner of a parking lot. A fatal shot followed, after which the suspect disappeared. [man on TV] Yes. At this moment we don't know the reason yet. What we know is that the suspect fled in the direction of the Sloterkade, after shooting her victim. [woman] Together with your help, we can track the suspect, Mel B, - as soon as possible. - Mel? - If you recognize the suspect... - [Thomas] What is this? That's not me. Contact the police directly. [dramatic dreamy music playing] [gasps] You have to go. Follow me. I have an idea. [music continues] [cameras clicking] [indistinct office chatter] Can I look at this one? Camera 45. Rewind it. Stop, maybe this? [music fades] Shit. It's not her. [Mel breathing heavily] [Thomas grunts] [both sigh] [exhales] - That's not me. - What? I didn't do that. I believe you. Even though she looked just like you and it also said your name. [chuckles] [exhales] [Thomas] Okay. Fine. Let's figure out what to do. You say we can't go to the police, then what? Nothing. Okay. Yeah... Uh... We'll just wait here until they come to shoot us again. Great idea [call ringing] I have to figure this out. If I can understand it, I'll know what to do. Okay. Mel. This video, what's going on? Fuck, Mel. Did you kill that fucking guy? Oh, Jesus. Shut up you. What? I mean, sorry. It's just, it's a fucking good fake. [Jay] Mel, this is definitely not the guy from last night. There's no way he could pull this off. Girl, what did you do? Who did you piss off? [Mel] The only other thing I can think of is... I fucked up some hacker that was trying to steal information from this bus company. - [Jay] Self-driving busses? - Yeah. [Yu] What the fuck would hackers want with self-driving busses? I don't know. The only way is to tear this video apart, see who made it, and trace it back to them. I don't know Mel, this is really difficult. - I know. - I'm not sure I can pull this off. Come on. We know who can do this. Huh? [emotional music playing] - No way. - I talked to him a while back. You what? You talked to Buddy? - [Jay] I know where we can find him. - I don't want to ask Buddy. [woman sighs] Mel Bandison. Wasn't she in your office this morning? I know. Reggie van Kempen, from Ridderkerk. A hacker with a criminal record for phishing. Nothing big. But we're still looking into his connection with Bandison. Hmm. It might be related to those revenge attacks. I want to talk to Bandison's employer. Friends, family. I need to know where she's been the past few days. I want to check it now, warrant or no warrant. Uh... [sighs] [melancholy music playing] RUNAWAY HACKER MEL B. COMMITS MURDER! COLD KILLER MEL B. AND HELPER FLED MURDERER MEL B. ON THE RUN! WANTED - MEL B. A KILLER HACKER! Just to be clear. Why exactly do you think we're involved? [Dries] This is one of the last places Mel B. visited. Yeah, so? [Dries] And, uh, nothing. It's part of our investigation. I already talked with Richard Berge, Mel's manager. He stated that Mel traced a hack here during the last check. Well, a hack. A bug in the system. I've discussed it with my partners and it's negligible. - Your partners? - Xiao Ming. Rotramax is a transport company and they control the operating system, the software. Mrs. Van Erp, is there a chance that someone wants to use your company? A hacker, a criminal organization? Really? Thrilling. Not likely. And have you or your partners recently had experience with ransomware? Not at all. If we did, you'd have certainly seen it in the press, and I wouldn't be able to talk about it anyway, for legal reasons. Please, I have an appointment soon. Can I help with any more concrete questions? No, that's it. For the time being. Thank you. [telephone ringing] Hello? [man on phone] Mr. Deen, I presume. Yeah. Uh, yes? I'd like to speak to Miss Bandison, please. - Uh, okay. I was ju... - Thank you. Mel? Mel, Mel, telephone. Why do you still have your phone? But... What? That's not allowed? Yeah? Miss Bandison, how good it is to speak with you. My name is Rogers. I have a client who has some trouble since you dropped your Trojan horse. So you made a deep fake? I am as shocked by that little movie clip as you are. Who are you? I'm calling the police. I wouldn't do that if I were you. That clip was rather realistic and by the time we get this cleared up, your life will be ruined. But we could make a deal. You give me the encryption for that beautiful Trojan horse and your movie clip problems will disappear. [Mel] You know it's not me. [Rogers] Well, it certainly looks like you. So, you can go to jail for murder and we'll find you there to finish our business or we can end this right now. - So, what are they going to do with it? - That's really no concern of yours. The pipeline. Why was it there? Now again, Miss Bandison, give us the encryption to fix this. You know, you really should focus on your safety and that of your friend. - Mr. Deen, are you still there? - Yeah. Yeah. Help your friend make the right decision and then we won't kill you. - We have to get out of here. - What? My... my phone! Come on. [tense music playing] [Mel] Why did you have your phone? You heard what he said? [music fades] He will kill you! Well, give him that fucking inscription thing. It's encryption. What do you think will happen to me if he has that? He'll let us go? It's our one and only lifeline. Lifeline. Yeah, right. Once I go over that video, I'll know who made it. I'll prove my innocence to them. - And then we can go to the police. - You won't be able to do that. Nor your friends. I know one person who can. All right, let's go see him then. I turned him in to the police. Interpol is after him. [intense computer sounds] Here. This is less than 15 minutes ago. [Dries] They're stealing that bike. Hm-mm. Yes, and I think that is Thomas Deen, who was with her in that café in the south side. We'll lose them on the highway, but this is her. This just came in. Our hacker from Ridderkerk. He's a homeless person and known in our database. He was arrested for a long list of thefts. So someone took the time to put a junkie in a suit and make a new ID for him before Bandison shot him. That's so strange. Remarkable in fact. [suspenseful music playing] Got eyes everywhere. Very well. [birds chirping] Are you sure it's here? Well, Jay sent him a message, so... Okay. That's, uh... promising, I guess. But the video's been double-checked. - By forensic and a third party. - [chuckles] It's 100% real. So she did it. Something's not right. Dries, we have the proof. Yeah? Is that true? [scoffs] Yeah! Jesus. We have a suspect that's been lost for several hours. They could be anywhere on the planet. He's not coming, he hates me. Well... Interpol, right? Finding criminal hackers, that was our sport. We turn them in to the police and return the money to the victims. Or that's what I thought. Fucking naive. Buddy kept all the money. Hmm. He used me. That's why I called Interpol. They didn't find him. He's definitely the best I know. If anyone can help me with this, it's him. If he shows up. [sighs] [vehicle approaching] [opera music playing loudly] [song ends] So... Being on the run from Interpol brings people together, [Buddy chuckles] Hey, I thought that was very funny. Is your boyfriend coming? Buddy. - Hi. Thomas. - Hmm. How are you, kid? Good. - You got chubby. - [laughs] I always was. [Thomas] Wow, that's cool. Your car has Wi-Fi. We won't get bored on the road. For example, I can look at this for hours and hours. Yeah. They did a great job. But there has to be a gap somewhere. Any idea who you made so angry? Not yet. Some guy name Rogers called me. He's British. [Buddy] Hmm. He works with hackers who are demanding access to a company I worked for. Serious fellas. And talented too. [chuckles] It sucks, right? To be on the run? He doesn't look like a hacker. [Mel] You think? Well, I don't know. In movies, hackers are thinner. And younger. On his computer, he's hard as a rock. Rock-hard, huh? [tires squealing] [scanner beeps] If anyone is hungry there's leftover pizza over there, it's from yesterday. [opera music playing on speaker] [chuckles] - Can I get on? - Calm down. Hmm, look at this? Cuckoo-cuckoo! Hold on. It was a standard check-up. Everything was done remotely. Very routine. Until I saw this. - [Buddy] Oh. - [Mel] Yeah. [Thomas] What? - Very well hidden. - Yeah. I sent a Trojan horse and disabled every connected computer. - Mel's middle finger. - That one. - [Buddy] Yeah. - [Mel] This is big. Why would they put so much effort in trying to find me? The video, someone's dead. Threatened to kill Thomas. Yeah. It's ridiculous. I don't have anything to do... Shh! Can I? So... Let's see. This is boring. This is boring too. - Yeah, if you... - Yeah. Can I get a moment? Go and make some coffee. Go. [typing furiously] [grunts softly] [knuckles crack] - [computer beeps] - [chuckles] Son of a bitch. [Thomas] Hey, someone by accident ordered a pizza? I could, uh, revive a couple of pieces. Artificial respiration. [chuckles] Mel. Put that thing away. Aren't you going crazy? Those codes. Code. Code, codes. You never go crazy? No, it calms me down. This is what it looks like in my head. [opera music playing on speakers] [music soars] [soft tinkling] Look. [opera music continues] [Buddy] Mel! I've found something. [music stops] [Buddy] Okay, are you ready for this? Xiao Ming is a very well-behaved, boring software company. They've already been doing business with Rotramax for four years. Self-driving buses, bad idea, Linde. Xiao Ming specializes in facial recognition software, conforming to all European regulations. And Mel even gave them a certificate for being so well-behaved. - A sticker, for good behavior. - Yeah, and? Xiao Ming isn't the problem. This is about the hackers I shut down. That's the fun part. If you look closely, really closely, closer than ever before... Mmm... - Oh, fuck. - [Thomas] What? - Are you serious? - What? You guys, like we discussed before, not all of us understand this stuff. Those hackers and Xiao Ming are working for the same company. Yep. Your beautiful Trojan horse took down a whole Chinese multinational company. A company connected to dozens of other companies across the globe. If their scanner scans your face, their software is very aggressive. They scan your face to get your identity information, to access your bank account and deduct the travel fares. But they go further. They take your socials, financial details, medical data, everything else, and they forward it all in bulk. Where to? I'm afraid that's the real problem, and the reason why they put so much effort in blackmailing you. All that personal data goes directly to the Chinese government. Oh fuck. [Buddy] If the world finds out that China is harvesting data using this software, that's an international drama they can't get out of. But no one will believe a violent hacker. - [telephones ringing] - [indistinct chatter] [cell phone buzzing] Daoudi. [Mel] Mr. Daoudi, this is Mel Bandison. Miss Bandison. So kind of you to call. Perhaps this time we can get closer. I hope so. Where are you? Rotterdam? [whispers] It's Bandison. [Mel] The video I'm in, it's fake. I'm being framed by Xiao Ming Incorporated. That's a front of the Chinese government to steal private data by using facial recognition software. When I used a Trojan horse... [Dries] Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me stop you here. Chinese government? Stealing data? I'm investigating a murder, you're the suspect. I didn't do that. That video is fake. They're trying to blackmail me, so I can't go to the police. Okay, you're being blackmailed as well? [Mel] By an Englishman, Rogers. This is exactly what he wanted. You're not listening to me. Miss Bandison, I am listening. I am investigating and I want to help. If you turn yourself in, I can do more for you. Oh, yeah? That's your way of investigating? Waiting, until I come to you? I am sending my information to digital forensics. They need to look at it. You need to make sure this murder investigation doesn't get in the way. I understand, but it doesn't work like that. You don't understand. Jesus, fucking annoying dude. Did you get it? No, I think they crossed the border. We can't do anything now. She mentioned some Rogers. Let's investigate that. [clicking] Mr. Rogers. There's a strong possibility they're within a 30-kilometer radius of Antwerp, Belgium. [tense music playing] [melancholy music playing] [bag rustling] [birds chirping] [gasps] [suspenseful piano music playing] [sizzling] Hey, fried egg? Buddy, it's the scan. [Buddy] What? On the bus, they scanned me. That's why the video is so good. You let them scan your face? If I got that scan, could I prove the clip is fake? [laughs] You let yourself get scanned. Buddy, does it work like that? Uh... Listen, if they use a scan for that video, then, uh, you've got your proof. Huh? Code doesn't lie. What if Daoudi is speaking the truth? He said he'd try to help us if we turn ourselves in? I'm going back to Rotterdam. Huh? What? What is she doing? She's going back to Rotterdam to hack the camera's on that fucking bus. [Thomas] What? Mel? Mel? Mel? Mel? Hey, you can't go back to that bus. I have to get that scan. I've got to. That is suicide, those guys are waiting there for you. - Do you have a better idea? - Yeah. Stay here. Wait until Buddy comes up with something. Oh, yeah? Wait until Buddy comes up with something? I'm going to hack that bus, I will find that scan, I'm solving this. That's my idea. [Thomas] Uh-oh. What? Fuck. Go. Buddy! How is this possible? I always shield everything. - Buddy, we have to go. - Damn it! What? I have to erase stuff first. - Come on. - [loud bang] Come on! Hurry up. Start the car, I'll be right there. - Fuck. - Hurry. Go! [alarms blaring] [suspenseful music playing] - Damn it. - [glass breaking] - [explosion] - Ah! [ringing sound] [Buddy grunting] Buddy, finally. Is that really you? Where is she? She? [gun cocks] Nice gloves you're wearing, buttercup. - Where did you buy... - [gunshot] [sound muffles] [oppressive music playing] [heartbeat pounding] - [sound resumes] - [panting] Come on. Come on! Let's go. [grunts] Come on! [tense music playing] Come on, get in. [tires squeal] [engine revving] [Thomas] Shit. - Fuck! - [Mel] Come on, Thomas! - Faster. - [Thomas] I can't go faster. Come on, come on, come on! [grunts] [Mel] You can do it. Come on. [gunshot] Fuck! - [gunshot] - [Thomas] Ah! - [gunshot] - [Thomas yells] Ah! Oh fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. [Rogers] Come on, move it! [breathing heavily] [Rogers] Come on! Fuck. Want to go over it again? No, no need. The councilor comes at 5:00, press confirmed and at 6:30... - We're leaving. - Yes. At 6:30 we'll drive away. At quarter to seven... Thank you, I have to... Is this about the investigation? Miss Van Erp, in our investigation, we have to... I don't understand why you keep coming back here. It's highly inconvenient, I'm very busy. Do I need to say it again? This case has nothing to do with my company. We're trying to figure that out. Your partner is Xiao Ming Incorporated. [Dries] How did you come to work together? Do you have connections with other companies in which they have shares? What? No. I am in the middle of the launch of our product. And I am in the middle of a murder case. I have quite a few questions for you. I suggest you send them to our legal department, so I'll have time to answer them properly. Sounds good, that's what we'll do. Please do, I have an appointment. Mr. Chen, you promised me that there would never be any loose ends. I've held up to my side of the deal for 100%. I have built these busses. I made a deal with the city, I have done everything you asked. I never wanted anything to do with this extra software you put in my bus and now the police are here every day, asking about Xiao Ming, asking about this Bandison woman. You have to fix this or else I will. I am not going to jeopardize my company because you can't control your fuck-ups. Mr. Chen, may I? Excuse me? Mrs. Van Erp, I've been listening to the conversation and I want to make one thing absolutely clear. Any more threats to Mr. Chen or his company will lead to vast repercussions that you may not be able to grasp at this moment. Repercussions targeted not only at your company, but also at yourself as a person. Do you understand? Good. Then please, launch your bus. Don't call again. [breathing shakily] Let's just... He shot him, just like that. [Thomas] Yeah. Mel, we have to... Dammit, he had nothing to do with it. [screams] Fuck! [soft dramatic music playing] Fucking asshole! [sobs] [continues sobbing] [phone beeps] [cell phone buzzing] Hello? Bandison? [Thomas] No. Thomas. This is Thomas Deen. [Yu] We are going to find those fuckers and fuck 'em up. [Jay] Okay, Mel, listen. You have to find a way to hide somewhere. You have to disappear for a while. Okay? I have to do this. - [Jay] Thomas, can you hear me? - Yeah. [Jay] Come on, man, help me out. Okay? You think she listens to me? - [Jay]You're driving the car, are you not? - Yeah. - Then drive her somewhere else. - Yeah. I... Drive her somewhere else, you fucking idiot. Hey, that's enough out of you. Asshole. Do you think I like what is happening? Dude, just help her out. She's going to do something stupid, just stop her, okay? What the fuck do you think I'm trying? Huh? Fuck you, man. Fuck you. Shitty computer thing on the other side of the world. I'm done with all this bullshit. [beeps] [sighs] I know it's a lot. But I can't quit now. You know, last time I checked, they're trying to kill us both. They won't get me. Mel, we are in this together. In fact, you dragged me into this, and somehow you keep thinking only about yourself. "I can't stop. They won't get me." I'm here too, okay? [melancholy piano music playing] Here. What are you doing? These people are murderers. The only ones who can help us now are the police. Thomas, no way you're calling the police. I already called them! You have to stop this. Your friends are saying the same thing. Mel? [police sirens approaching] Where are you going? [dramatic music playing] [sirens continue] [woman] Hands up! Stay where you are! Against the car. Hands behind you. [Dries] Mel? Hold up. - Where is Bandison? - Wait. Wait up. Hold up one sec. I didn't do anything. - Where is she? - Are you Dries Daoudi? Where is Mel Bandison? - It's not about Mel, it's about Rogers. - Tell me now. - Gone. - Come again? She left. - Take him to the station. - What? Why? I'm innocent. We are not done talking yet. Go after Rogers now! Okay? The years of development and investments haven't been for nothing. Rotramax persevered and with the support of Councillor Wahlia... [crowd applauding] I am proud to welcome you to the first self-driving, self-functioning, high-tech city bus in Rotterdam. [applause] [Linde] This isn't the end. Within a few years, Rotramax will change cityscapes worldwide. We are conquering the globe, but that's for later. Now I can... [computer fans whirring softly] [sighs] [suspenseful music playing] [computer powering up] [indistinct police radio chatter] Mr. Deen. - What are you doing here? - Will you walk with me? Have you caught Rogers yet? That man is insane. He's looking for Mel. You have to help her. We want to help. Then do something. Help her. That Roger guy, nobody knows him. Not in China, not in the Netherlands. Okay, so you think I made this up? Hello? Hello, I saw it all with my own eyes. Huh? - A murder in Belgium. - Yeah. - With shots and explosions and all? - Yeah. We'd have heard of that by now. It was a remote place. An industrial area, I told you. Was it remote enough for Bandison to kill someone else? - And invent another suspect? - What? What is this about? What are you saying? - You have to listen... - I don't have to do anything. Where is Mel Bandison? - Mr. Deen? - Yeah. We're trying to help you. We've asked about the potential murder in Belg... It's not potential murder. - [sighs] Murder. - [Thomas]Yeah. [Dries] And our cybercrime department is investigating, as Bandison asked, Xiao Ming in China. I want to help her, but first I need to know first where she is. Yeah. Isn't that why you called me? To help her? - No, to stop Rogers. - A message from our Belgian colleagues. Here. They found a body at an area near Oostmalle. [Thomas] Yeah. Do you believe me now? But if this is really true, why don't you tell me where she is? Have a glass, come on. Take a quick look up. [scanning sounds] Yes, great for the road. Look up. Look, the check-in and check-out is easily carried out by the scanner. Completely safe, of course. I think we are almost ready to go now. Yes, the sensors of the doors might be the most outdated part of the bus. [all laugh] [soft suspenseful music] [swirling computer noises] [noises fade] [Rogers] Well, I must say, you certainly gave us a run for our money. Impressive. But it's over now. Now that I'm here, you can stop searching for your evidence and start unlocking my clients' computers. So they can go on stealing our data. Yes. And this is not a discussion. Do it now. Okay. Yes, I've got her here. It'll be any minute now. - [starter gun fires] - Yes! - Yes, here we go. - [crowd cheers] - And we're off. - [laughter] The only place where you can drive with champagne in your hands. The bus is equipped with over 30 environmental sensors, which scan surroundings continuously for obstacles. That way, we go safely from network point - to network point. - [man] Whoa. And the bus follows a pre-set route. [indistinct chatter] Uh, does anyone have information about Mel Bandison? Hello? Is Mel safe at all? All right. [men yelling in distance] - What's taking so long? - It's a very complicated encryption. Well, fix it! Almost there. [suspenseful music playing] Get ready to take over. [computers power down] Fuck! [panting] Ah! [tense music playing] [officer] Moving in, in formation. Go. Go to the back. Well, well. Look at you. You killed my friend. Calm down, don't do anything... Just shut it. Just shut up. [gasps, groans] Have we finished playing yet? - [groans] - [grunts] Let's get back to work. [grunting] - Police. - Freeze. Don't move. Don't move. Yeah, we're quite proud... [electricity crackling] [Linde] Nothing to worry about. Sometimes this happens. [all yelp] [officer] Do not move. You need to go after Rogers. Fuck. Suspect by the stairs. Come on, she's unarmed. Help her up. [sparking] [beeping] [passengers scream] [grunts] [line ringing] Destroy the evidence, destroy the bus! Open that fucking bridge. [tense music playing] Fuck. - Police. - Drop the gun! Drop the gun! - [gunshot] - [groans] [officer] Stay down. Stay down. Don't you move. Stay down. I'll break your arms. [groans] [sparking] Stay calm. Everybody stay calm. [woman screams] [screams] Oh my God. Come on, let me go. We have to go to the server room, so I can finally prove my innocence. Come on. My responsibility. [handcuffs unlocking] Let's go. - Fire in the server room. - [Mel] Here. [Mel] Fuck. Dries, where are you? The bus is out of control. Find the route of the bus, now. [Dries] At Rotramax, the server is on fire. [Rosa] Shit, it's heading towards the Erasmus bridge. I've got it, I see it. I can help. If I can figure out how to hack that bus, then... Can you stop it? I can try to. Okay. [call ringing] - Mel! Mel, what the fuck, where were you? - Are you okay? I'll explain later. I've got another problem. A self-driving bus, 15 people, it's not stopping. The connection with its server, it's gone. We have to hack its local access point. Yeah, we can try, but this is going to take forever. We don't have the time. Fuck. [Jay] We'd have to get someone in there with a computer that we easily can connect to, huh? Can you send me what we need to connect to? - [call ringing] - [Yu] Guys? What the fuck? Buddy is calling me. What? Buddy? - Mel! - [Mel] Thomas! Hey, are you okay? Sorry... Are you driving Buddy's car? [Thomas] Yeah, yeah, I, uh... Thomas, I need you. The bus is out of control with 15 people in it, and it's about to crash. Do you see a green thing behind the screens? [Thomas] Yeah, I do. With that transceiver I can access the bus. Thomas, you have to get in that bus somehow. At the front of the bus is a receiver. You have to plug it in to the top plug. Fifteen people in that bus, Thomas. [sirens wailing] [yelling] [passengers screaming] Rosa, is the bridge clear? We only have a couple of Yes, the main road is almost clear and the spike mats are on the way. [sirens blaring] Fuck. Wait. Hey, which idiot is opening the bridge? [officer] Close the bridge. Control room, get that bridge closed now. Fuck. [tense music playing] Someone is opening the bridge. We have to do something. Oh, fuck. Okay, Yu-Jinn, come on. We got this. How much longer? - Thomas, where are you? - I'm almost there. [sirens wailing] I see it. - [tires screeching] - [sirens wailing] [screaming] [squealing] [grunts] [grunts] [tires squealing] Okay, you can do it. You can do it. See you soon. [Mel] Thomas? Thomas. [exciting music playing] [police sirens wailing] - [grunts] - Oh, look. Oh shit. [grunts] Oh my God! [Thomas grunting] - [passengers] Whoa! - [metal banging] [loud bang] [grunting] - [Thomas] Ah! - [passengers gasp] [grunts] Hi! Hi. I have to get by. [tense music playing] Okay, what now? What now? All right, all right. - [metal clanging] - All right, something in here... Huh... Uh... [breathing heavily] Okay. Top plug. Uh, top plug. - Uh, yeah. Yeah. - [static crackling] [computers powering up] Yes. I'm in. [Rosa] Dries, waiting on you. What's the status? We're working on the bridge. The hackers are trying to get control back and Mel... Mel is working on the bus. [siren approaching] [Rosa] Shit. [sirens wailing] [officers clamoring] [passengers screaming] [screaming] Fuck. [passengers yelling] [officer] Rotterdam port service, stand-by. Mel, if you can hear me. If you could stop us now, that would be great. [Dries] What is the status now? [Dries, echoing] Mel, give me an update. [swirling computer noises] Mel! [noises fade] [tires screeching] [screaming] [loud screeching] [passengers whimpering] [indistinct upset chatter] [Yu] It stopped. Guys, it stopped. The bus stopped! You did it, Mel. [Jay laughs] Oh my God. Mel, you're fucking brilliant. [chuckles] [police sirens wailing] Help! Help! Go! Go! Come on, guys. Keep going. - Help! - Please help us! - [Dries] Mel, what are you doing? - Wait. [computer chimes] [Mel] Images are coming back from the bus. Look. Scans of my face. Sent from the bus. Hmm. This is it. This image proves the video is fake. Code never lies. [woman sobbing] [dramatic music playing] [upbeat rhythmic music playing] [music stops] [computer chimes] [Mel] Huh? Buddy? Hey, Mel. If you receive this, your Buddy is probably dead and buried. Or they cut out my eyes so the iris scan doesn't work anymore. You get the idea. If I don't log in for three days, you will receive this video. [chuckles] Yes, you. I loved hanging out with you. Good times, you and me. Except, uh, for the time you betrayed me. [laughs] But... it doesn't matter anymore, because I'm dead. All that money I kept for myself, I didn't use everything. I built a network, for you. No more small stuff, no working on the fringe. Everything is here, ready for you to start working on the big things. Multinationals, government leaders, multi-billionaires. You wanted to change the world. You've got no excuses anymore. I'm proud of you. [Thomas] When are we starting? As soon as you can keep up with me and we can stop taking the bus to work. Oh, yes, that's right. Fair point. Come on. Wait. I have a new invention. Pineapple, mango, and some red pepper. Tropical, but with just the perfect bite. Give it a try.
