[narrator] This is Heidelberg, the Heidelberg Castle, the Neckar... [student shouting indistinctly] ...a fraternity student who has lost his group. - [dings] - [child speaking] [narrator] And this is a small celebration of the Voigt family in 2004. "...expression in the empty tree." [narrator] And this is Isabelle, nickname Isi. [Claudia whispers] Isi. Isi has prepared one as well. [narrator] And her mother, Claudia, who has rehearsed a deliberately chosen poem with Isi for days. Come on. Come forward. - [man 1 coughs] - [man 2 clears throat] [Isi farts] [Isi chuckles] [narrator] While Isi learned about the word "grounded" for the first time, a completely different family moved to the neighboring city, Mannheim. This is also the Neckar, Germany's best kebab, and this is the Markowski family from Brandenburg. Tell me, which has more letters, "pepper" or "orange"? [narrator] This is Oscar. I don't give a shit. [narrator] And his mother, Betty. It's the same. Weird, right? Oscar, nobody likes smartasses. Now get me the fries. Who invented French fries? - Mr. French. - And where do they come from? - From the fries animal. - And who invented the PlayStation? [Ossi's grandpa] Your granny. - Really? - Sure. That's why she took off. Because she got rich with the PlayStation, the stupid cunt. [narrator] And Oscar's grandpa, with whom Oscar wouldn't spend much time, as Grandpa chose a sure-fire business opportunity that day. Come on, hand over the money! Put it in a bag. - I don't have... - Fuck! Do you have a bag? [speaking in other language] What? Hey! Shut up! Speak German for crying out loud! [in German] How are you? - "How are you?" - [continues speaking in other language] Hey! Now give me the money or I'll shoot you in the foot! - Stand still. - [screaming in other language] - [gunshot] - [screams] [prison door slams] Goddamn foreigners. Shit. Ah. [narrator] At the same time that Oscar's grandpa bent over for his soap, Isi decided to get to the bottom of a big secret in her home. Mom, I need to go to the toilet. Yeah, okay. But hurry, we haven't even done half yet. [woman] Tomorrow is a big party. It'll have to be a lot more snappy then. Double that speed at least, I'm telling you. Now get cutting properly, boy, or are you in love with the tomato? Those are not the boobs of a 16-year-old. It's food! [man] Yes, I'm doing it. [Claudia] Excuse me. Isi, come on. You can't disturb them at work. I said downstairs is off-limits. [narrator] Even though Isi and Oscar were practically neighbors in Heidelberg and Mannheim, there was one main difference between them. When Isi was ten years old, the wealth of her family was exactly €2,347,867,513.27. That's why her schooldays looked like this. [in English] Don't worry. Just because you're a slow learner, doesn't mean you're less intelligent than the others. [narrator in German] At the same time, the wealth of Oscar's single mom was exactly €27.63. [students yelling] That's why Oscar's schooldays looked like this. Just keep quiet! [narrator] This is Tschünni, by the way. He just decided to become Oscar's best friend. As his aggression grew worse, his mother Betty brought him to boxing. The boy is good. I like him. - Hey, lanky. - [coach] We'll take him. What kind of a shitty name is Oscar? I'll call you Ossi. That's better. - Perfect. After all, I am an Ossi. - [Tschünni] Cool. [narrator] Over the years, the kitchen became Isi's absolute favorite place. "Did they put your brain in the wrong way round?" You never said that. Don't talk back to your boss when she's trying to be cool, asshole. And you, rat, are you laughing at me? [narrator] While her school career had developed into a disaster. "Recommendation for... Realschule"? Manfred. [narrator] Therefore, Claudia dismissed all kitchen personnel in 2012. It's in your best interest. You need to concentrate on your schoolwork, honey. [narrator] Ossi had had no interest in school for a long time already. He's now in his early 20s and the breakthrough in his boxing career is pending. [coach] Belt, belt! Hit his trap! - What? - Punch his mug! - What? - You're supposed to deck me. Like carrying water to the Rhine. [narrator] Right now, Ossi is facing his most important fight against Yannis Vukovic. If he does well, he can make the professional league. - [butler] Just arrived. - Thank you. - Isi, where are you? - Kitchen. [narrator] Isi has just passed her Abitur after a long school career which included repeating two classes. According to the principal, the worst Abitur result in the 400-year-old school history. [man in English] I invite you to check out our New York School of Culinary Arts, where you can make your diploma in 12 months. Check out our website of culinary arts. Register and join me in New York to learn from the best of the world. [narrator in German] And in just a few weeks, Isi is supposed to attend a prestigious business school. [Claudia] Listen, Isi, I know you're not keen on attending the prom, but maybe this will change your mind. [narrator] Okay, that's about it. This is where our story begins... [rap song playing in English] ♪ No weapons in here ♪ ♪ You see, I'm trying to get out, Ma But I feel trapped ♪ ♪ What employer gonna hire me When I sell crack? ♪ ♪ I'm not fully rehabilitated I fell back ♪ ♪ And regret is a muhfucker Run, tell that ♪ ♪ I've been working For the Devil too long ♪ ♪ Tempt us, lead us to the edge Watch the wise turn into fools ♪ ♪ The greatest lie ever been told Is the one closest to truth ♪ ♪ I've been working For the Devil too long ♪ ♪ I've been working for the Devil too long I'm gone ♪ [Ossi's Grandpa] And coincidentally, I even know your aunt's husband! [all laughing] ♪ I've been working for the Devil too long I'm gone ♪ Isabelle! Roll up! Come on! I have an appointment in the faculty room, but... I know you're supposed to pick up your brain... Your Abitur results. [chuckles] Your brain? What nonsense. You never had it with you. Are you drunk? I have just quit and I noticed your... Abitur lying around and thought I'd give it to you and congratulate you. - You quit. - Congratulations. Please give Dr. Büttner my congratulations on your graduation. GENERAL QUALIFICATION FOR UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE Oh, no! You missed out on that even though your lawyer was here so often. Tsk. Oh. Hmm. Your parents did this behind your back. But you must have been wondering yourself how you could pass the Abitur with the IQ of a gummy bear. Quite an achievement. What? - Lawyer? - You know, for someone who worked hard, it's really great to see that there is an easier way. You just need rich parents, good lawyers, making teachers' lives hell till they turn into alcoholics and they blow the Abitur up the ass of every borderline moronic rich kid! Just great! [car horn blares] [man] Shit got more expensive again. - Not your fault. - No, it got less expensive. Make it 46, boss. [bell rings] Time to talk about Grandpa. The shit is getting more expensive every week. I say democracy is crap. I experienced Hitler. Man, you haven't. How old are you, 70? Retard. This time he stays out of jail, Ossi, you hear? And you make sure he behaves. - When is he coming out? - Monday, probably. You know what Grandpa is like. He always needs some support. I don't care about the asshole. I need to prepare for the fight. - Don't talk about your Grandpa like that. - [bell rings] - Mrs. Markowski? - [Betty] That's correct. Um... My boss asked me to give you this - in person. - How nice. A bit of goodwill. I don't think you got the others. - Next time, it will be the marshal. - Right. Or the police. Actually, I don't know who will show up, but it won't be us. Tax office? - Do you not want to look inside? - [Betty chuckling] No. Okay, we're just investing into an electronic pump, so we won't need your help anymore. [tax officer clears throat] - The missing €14,000... - [Betty] Yeah. ...and I would like to stress the "missing" part... [Betty] Calm down now. [bell rings] - Who's this idiot? - Tschünni, don't, man. - Betty, honey, how are you? All okay? - Everything's fine. Just ignore him, okay? Thank you for coming by. Everything is under control. The €14,000 is not an investment. It's a debt you owe to the tax office and you need to pay immediately, - before you invest in anything else. - [Betty] Thanks. Bye. - We owe €14,000? - It's really not a big deal. How is this not a big deal? When were you going to tell me about it, huh? - [Tschünni] Got another construction job. - [Betty] Yes? - Mom? Hey! - [Tschünni] I might become manager. I got the car from my dad for my Abitur. Could you park it somewhere else while our parents are here? [woman 1] Excuse me, he just got it. Of course he wants to show it off today. If my dad sees you have a Tesla, he'll get me one, too. Just tell him you don't want one. [Camilla] Will that help his self-esteem or enlarge his weenie? So I'll get a Tesla. I survived bigger things. [woman] Poor you, you got problems. [Camilla] Isi? Isi? GALLERY [Camilla] Why are we running? Isi! - How nice. - Have you seen my parents? Listen, I'll help you find them if you go on another date with me. What? You had two dates. She's not interested. - How sad are you? - Okay, in that case, I suggest we say I was here, tried everything, in case anybody's asking, like your father... Camilla, are you my witness? What did he give you? He's just worried about you, you know that, and he likes me a lot, and the internship in Shanghai isn't happening, and now your father is checking if maybe... My father promised you an internship if you try again? Uh, yeah. Which I have done here in front of witnesses. Could you send me the video? Thank you. Enjoy the exhibition. I find it a bit... loud. Lanky, listen. That, uh, Vuku... Ludu... - Sudoku, Sonduko... - Vukovic, man. [Tschünni] Yeah, just knock him out, you know what I mean? But I still won't have the damn €14,000, man. Fuck that. But deck that lame duck, you hear? [coach] Ossi! Hey, dumbass. Listen, I'm having a bit of trouble with your sponsor. The silly clot is peeved about something. - What? - Clot. We have a problem. A disaster. The end of the world. Armageddon. - What? - Your sponsor has jumped ship. - He jumped on? - Jumped off! - He jumped off. Talk clearly. - We don't have enough money for the fight. Your sponsor doesn't believe in you anymore. You're only here part-time and the rest of the day you spend at the pump. - Don't talk shit, dumbass. - He's out. That asshole. We need €8,000. [Tschünni] Ossi! [Isi] How long have you been fixing my grades? Isi. [clears throat] How nice of you to come to the opening of our exhibition that is so important to us. Mr. Erduan, I'll be right back. How long has your fucking lawyer been fixing my grades? He didn't fix them. He was just helping them a bit. There's no shame in that. Everybody gets tutoring. - Because I didn't really pass the Abitur? - You do have your Abitur. I don't have my Abitur and I won't go to college. Isi. Of course you'll go to college. I'll train to be a chef with Santino Borges in New York. - What? - It will be quite expensive. How much is in the deposit account you set up for me? You will get the money when you turn 25 and have graduated from college. - Could you stop with that stupid grin? - Could you stop making such a scene? - Isi. - I get my money now. It's completely normal that you're angry right now, but you don't seriously want to become a chef. Santino Borges is an Argentinian celebrity chef. And he teaches in his New York School of Culinary Arts. - Sounds like a satire. - Do you know what satire is? You promising someone an internship so he would date me. - I want my money now. - Isi! [sneezes loudly] [clears throat] You're not getting a cent for such bullshit! I want my money. From now on, I'll make my own decisions. Over my dead body. Isi! [Camilla clears throat] - A really nice show. - Thanks, Camilla. [Manfred] Klaus! Leave it. She'll come round. Training to be a chef, she's lost it. Follow her and watch her. And, Klaus! - Don't let her see you, okay? - Sure. "Champagne-cornflakes breakfast. Hashtag, fuck the world." 41,000 likes. - What's that supposed to tell me, Camilla? - The world is not fair. My 433,712 followers have accepted it and you should, too. Fact is, you have your Abi, you can go to college. Why should I? Why is it that everybody thinks I should go to college? College is easy. - I'm enjoying it. - But you have a 1.1 Abitur. I don't. I can't do that. I don't even know how... In case you're committing suicide, I would like to get out. Okay? [sighs] We're driving to Mannheim. [chuckles] Are you serious? I can't go to Mannheim. I didn't bring my pepper spray. Wait... [Camilla opens bag] [ticking] What are we doing in Mannheim? [Ossi] I just need this fucking fight, man. Or it won't work out with the professional league. - Enjoy. - How do you do it? You just don't care. You don't give a fuck you have to do construction work. - It's honest work. - Yeah, but you don't even try. - I mean, don't you want... - Ossi, you're so German. I'm what? "Hey, foreman, you need to do something with your life! No pain, no gain. You stole the goose." Fuck that. I'm not that German. HELP WANTED! [Tschünni] I'm just a normal German. If a potato fucks leeks, you're the result. That's how German you are. You keep doing construction. Drain yourself. Not me. Construction work is shit but someone has to do it. I can't do anything else. Hey, you're Ossi, right? The boxer? Oscar to you, brother. I'm not your brother, you fuck. I'm a boxer, too. Your technique sucks. - Okay. - Technique? Seriously? Hey, Baloo, you're cross-eyed. You can't box. - [man] Shut your trap! - [Tschünni] Shut up! [Ossi] Hey, man. Let us eat, okay? [Tschünni] Yeah, let us eat. You eat the burger, in case you can. It's a bit difficult in 2-D. Would you like me to get you 3-D glasses? - [man] Just you wait... - [Tschünni] Well, come on, then! Hey! Calm down, both of you! Sit down! Hello. What would you like? Hello. I saw that you're hiring. Hello, what would you hire? - [cash register opens] - Oh! Ah. - Boss! Hmm. - I mean... - Gabriella. - The register opened. Then close it. Excuse me. I saw that you're hiring. I want the job. You don't fit in here. - Why not? - You have more than three brain cells. [Isi] I still want to try. I pay peanuts, all my staff are impaired, and the food we serve has been proven to make you blind and impotent. Perfect. I'm just the girl. Okay, then. Trial day tomorrow? [Tschünni] Your grandpa is getting out of jail. You need cash, you need to risk something. Am I supposed to rob a bank or something with him? Grandpa is the most untalented gangster ever! - He's a playboy. - Right. Finished. - Come on, let's get started. - [chuckling] Very well. - [Ossi] Hey, man. - [grunts] - [groans] - You can only blame yourself, dumbass. [man grunts] Come on, mongo. [groaning] Get up. Yes, there. Dumbass. - [Tschünni] Did I win? - Hey! Um... Quite the show just now. Uh... It was his own fault. You just wanted to settle it. - Would you like to do something sometime? - Huh? Doesn't have to be the guy making the first move, right? - Text me. - What's your name? - Isabelle. - And? Voigt... Uh, Müller. My name is Müller. What about yours? Not telling you. I don't even know you. Is this art or rubbish? ART - RUBBISH [giggles] [clears throat] Sorry. Do you really think you can blackmail your parents like this? - [Tschünni] I can't find "Isabelle Vogt." - [Ossi] Try "oi." As in, make a point. [Betty scoffs] What's that? - [Tschünni] Yeah. - [Betty] Gross, those people. Dude. - Fierce. - [Betty] Filthy rich. I have an idea. You're thinking what I'm thinking, right? - Mmm-hmm. - Nice, Betty, we always think the same. - Hey, you can win her over, Ossi, hmm? - Huh? You don't even have to feel bad about it. As if a rich bitch like that would want me. - What? - What are you talking about? You're the most handsome guy I know. Ossi, listen. We need money and you can easily win her over. Yeah, you win her over and she'll help you. Nobody says you have to marry her. Just take a little bit of money. Hello? I'm serious. I've rarely felt as embarrassed as I did today. That someone so privileged, with such a good education, whose parents always had her back, that someone like that tramples her future and her Abitur... It makes me angry. Excuse me, Claudia. That's not how we wanted to word it. You will not become a chef. It's absurd. [chuckling] And that embarrassing number in Mannheim - in this... chips joint... - [Manfred breathing heavily] [Claudia] Isi, grow up. [cell phone chimes] Yo Hi sweet princess dinner? tomorrow fan belt [Tschünni] Ossi, you need to send a picture! Give it to me! - Leave it! - Dammit, man! - [Tschünni] Do you have a new deodorant? - [Betty] Fuck. Thanks for the bummer Number Do something tomorrow? Best wishes Ossi That's my name nickname. Real name is Oscar [Claudia] Isi. Yeah, you're right, Mom. Good night. [Manfred continues breathing heavily] Tomorrow 2:00 p.m. at the burger joint? So that's for the chips. If you use your brain for thinking and not as a paperweight, it's quite simple. Once it beeps, you take it out, hang it up and let it drip. You've met Gabriella. Keep an eye on her. She messes up anything that can possibly be messed up. - Boss, please and thank you. - Yeah, please and thank you. Then some salt, three times, mix it... and the doctorate is done. [sighs] There's still time to leave. No, I think it's great. It's real here. Not much in our food is real. But... - Is this the burger you made? - Uh, yeah. I tried something. Far too thick. Again. Boss. They're defrosted and smell of shit somehow. - They're absolutely fine. Come on. - Yeah. Don't look that closely all the time. Idiot. [Gabriella] Hello. What can I get you? K14. 85,000... Wait a second. - Yes? - [Klaus] Hello, Manfred. It's Klaus. Klaus, what is it? I'm in the middle of stocktaking. Isi is really working here. - Seriously? - One hundred percent. - I'm on it. Manfred, you... - I got you, yeah. - [sighs] - [Tschünni] Here? [Ossi] No clue. She suggested it. - Whatever. Lanky, go get her. - No clue how. How do you get a girl? The magic word is compliments. Compliment her, it's simple. Women like that. They're like junkies, their brain cuts out. You're the expert now, huh? One question, how did Rocky get Adrian? He went to the fucking pet shop every single night, complimented her, invited her for Thanksgiving. She didn't even say thanks once, not even once. In the end, he married her. And the pimps from the 19th do exactly the same. They bombard women with compliments. Then they fall in love. "I think you're the one for me. You're so pretty!" Then they rape them and pump them full of heroin. - You forget about the last part. - Not cool, man. - Can you make compliments? - Yes. - Can you make compliments? - [yelling] Normally, I can, man! [yelling] Let's go! Adrian! [chuckles] See you at the workout. [pop song playing over speaker] Hey. [chuckles nervously] [chuckles] Well? Hey. [clears throat] - Have you been waiting for long? - Uh, no. Good, 'cause you're not supposed to make a princess wait. [chuckles] Because you're so pretty. I mean, I come in, see you sitting there and think, "Okay, who's that model?" - Thanks. - And yesterday when you approached me, my eyes nearly popped out of my head, you're so pretty and... well... - Your outfit, no clue... - Well... - You know more about that than me. - I work here. Huh? What... - You work here? - Yes. I'm on my lunch break. You want to eat something? - You? - Yes. Maybe I do. Well, okay... MOM - Hurry up! Grandpa will be out at 2:30 p.m. already. Do you... fuck... Yourself... Do you have to... Right, they probably give it to you for free. Right, no, I don't think so. But don't worry. I'll pay for it. Emancipation and such. That's great. It's good you understand that. It shows that you have a really wicked character. That you're not just pretty like a flower in the forest, - but you have a lovely inner thing... - Hmm. Well, a wicked character, overall, like a wicked princess. - Okay. - Yeah. - So, is that a watch? It's a really cool. - Yes. It's the most... God, your arm is beautiful! May I... It's really... Not everybody has pretty arms. You, too. Your arms are good, too. Well, yes, I'm a boxer. - Cool. - Yeah. - So what are you doing? - I'm a boxer. Mmm. - And what do you do for a living? - Boxing. Cool. [both chuckle] I'm on my way into the professional league. Yeah, exactly, and... I mean, I have one more fight and if I win that, because I win most of the time... Last time I even broke somebody's jaw, and he nearly choked on his own blood, so they took him to the hospital. Ooh. - Yeah, right. - [chuckles] [sighs] Yeah, that sounds exciting. I'm sorry. I'm so confused. - Because you're so pretty. - [door opens] Because you're so... incredibly beautiful... Everything there, your... Everything, especially the nose. [footsteps approaching] Yikes! What are you doing here? [chuckles] Nice of you to visit me at my new workplace. Um... This is Ossi. My parents, Manfred Voigt, and Claudia Drechsler. Uh... von Eschbach... Uh... Claudia Voigt. [chuckles] Sorry, I always get confused with the many names of my mother. - Who's this now? - "Who's this now?" He's Ossi. We're just getting to know each other. You could just ask me and not talk about me in the third person. [Isi chuckles] So would you do us the honor of introducing yourself? She just did that, or are you a bit deaf, man? - What kind of a stupid asshole is he? - Pardon? - [mimics mockingly] "Pardon?" - [Isi] Super... Uh... Great that we're all getting to know each other. Who's hungry? What's this shit here? Jerk. [object clatters] Okay. You, um... You want to blackmail us, right? You set the deposit account up for my future, right? - Yes. - Good. The course and the apartment in New York will be very expensive. - So... - [Claudia scoffs] You don't seriously believe that your father and I fought for your future for all those years just to throw it away now. Stay right here, miss. Isi! Isi! MOM Ossi, you on the way yet? Relax! I'm on my way! - Wait. - Hey! - Sorry, that was weird. - Hey, what's with you? I need to go! Okay? Get out! I have a half hour lunch break. Okay, I have no clue what's going on with you and your parents, but I need to pick up my grandpa now. Okay? - I'm coming with you. - Are you... Get out now! Give me another chance, please. - I really need to go now, okay? - I'm coming. Klaus, follow them. Go... Klaus! Unbelievable! Klaus! What's this? - Where are we? - Where are we? - Follow them! - Manfred, Isi is here. - I have it all under control. - Isi just left! What's this with your parents? What's going on? Nothing. I... It's just that... You're different from all the... boring men I usually meet. [hip-hop song playing over car stereo] [increases volume] You listen to Jedi Mind Tricks? You know Jedi Mind Tricks? It's cool that you have CDs. Where are we picking up your grandpa? At the retirement home? - You cunts. - Grandpa. - Take care. - Enjoy your freedom, brother. [grunts] - I'm going to miss you. - Yeah, man. Fuck. [inmate yelling] Hey, Grandpa, are they letting you out to die? - Take care, jerks! - [inmates laughing] [prison door buzzes and opens] So, Weber, did you take a dump yet today, or as you like to call it, fucked backwards? I'll keep your favorite cell free for you. Wow. You have grown so big! A real giant. Awesome! Oh. That's real nice of you but I... just spent 14 years inside. I'm not sure I'll be able to get it up right away. You know, Grandpa, she's not a hooker. - Ah. She's your girlfriend? - No, that's... Just to fuck, then. - Hello. - Hello. Nice to meet you. [chuckling] Boy, how you look, really! Like an Aryan wet dream! Hitler, that old fairy, would have gone straight for you, I tell ya. [Ossi's grandpa] Hey, tell me, what's this shit? What have you done? It's like we're driving down A-rab road. - What's happened? - Grandpa, you can't say that anymore. Well, do you call them prissy or bitch? Just call them migrants. I don't see any migrants here, just illegals. And fairies. Look at this one over here. Hey, sweet cheeks. Bit shy, no? Do you not want to turn round? Grandma! [chuckling] We really enjoy watching you die, but can you... Shut up, man. Shut your mouth right now! You're not putting on one of your acts, is that clear? Leave those people alone! You move in with us and find a job. You hear me? Wow, you're grown into a real man. I only ever saw him as pussy-whipped. [Ossi] And I'll tell you something else, my best friend is an Arab, yeah? So watch what you say or I'll smash your face in! - Migrants! - Well, violence solves nothing, huh? - [Ossi] Shut up now! - Apart from that, I already have a job. Excuse me, I... - [Ossi] You have a job? - Yeah. Every single day in the cells for the last two years, me and the brothers... rapped. - You did what? - Yes, it's a... Well, one of them said I could take that as a qualification because I'm very good. - You're not a rapper, man! - But I am! - You don't... You have no brothers, man. - I kill all those so-called gangster rappers. You're not a rapper, man! You're a grandpa! So finally behave like a normal grandpa, man! And now to you! I know who you are. I saw your fucking profile. Maybe you want a real tough, trashy guy because all those rich softies are boring, but I only came because I need €8,000 for my next fight. Do you get that? This is no date, girl. I wanted to fleece you and that's it. But, honestly, I've had it with this shit. Now please go. Okay. Bye. - Please tell me you're fucking her. - [Ossi] Shut up. [Camilla] Just as well. They're stupid. They didn't get that it was the perfect chance to kidnap you. For a second, I was really scared. It was really crass. Real trashy. - He has a CD player in the car. - No! Okay, I want that, too. That's mega vintage. Um... So, two cheese... one crisp... - Two crisps. - [stammering] Two crisps instead of one. Look, I invented a new burger. Try it. Water 99% Rendering you infertile [Isi] It's just water. You can drink it. So this Ossi really admitted he only wanted to fleece you. Did you tell him what he was in for, too? [stammering] Hey. The thing... Gab... Gabriella is burning. - [Isi] Oh, God. - Where's that thing, the... The... - Fire extinguisher. - Yes! Fuck. Wait... [Gabriella yelling indistinctly] Not that bad. [shouts] Welcome to Mannheim. [chuckles] [cell phone chimes] Hi Isi, we blocked your deposit account and credit cards. You're not getting another cent until you snap out of it. Best wishes, Mom and Dad [sighs] [breathing heavily] [huffing] [grunts] - [rock song playing] - [indistinct chatter] Thanks for coming. Okay. [sighs] You can't pretend it's normal for a girl like you to listen to underground music like Jedi Mind Tricks. [chuckles] [inhales] [inhales] What happens if you can't get the money for the fight? If boxing doesn't work out? I've been training for ten years to get there. It will work out. You wanted to fleece me? Okay. Congratulations. I'll pay for your fight. - [glass shatters] - [people exclaiming] You just need to play along with what I want. I want us to pretend we are a couple. So my parents will give me something that I need from them. €10,000 if it works out. - Twenty-five. - What? You said €8,000. Now I say €25,000. My mother has debts. - €25,000 and it's a deal. - Okay. Good. So how's this supposed to work? - ...really had to endure it all in Kuwait. - [Isi] Hi. - Isi! - Isi. - Oh. You remember Volker? - Yes, sure. Great pictures. I just wanted to let you know that my boyfriend, he's quite into art and will drop in later. I hope that's okay? - Of course. - Great. - Your... boyfriend? - [objects clattering] [Claudia] Yeah. Well, that's... nice. [Tschünni] Ooh! A bit clumsy of you, but everything's fine. You've... - Uh... - Tschünni wanted to come, too. - Very artsy here. - Is there any food? Yes. Over there. Excuse me, Grandpa, this is an emergency. I'm hungry. - I'll be right back, Volker. - It's an emergency, sorry. - [Ossi] Are there any fries? - [Tschünni] Right. Hmm? Do you get this? Assholes. Asshole. Asshole. Alien asshole. Whoa! That's the biggest asshole I have ever seen in my life. But is it also the best? I don't know. What do you say? Which asshole do you personally like best? An interesting interpretation. Uh, Volker, I'd like to introduce you to somebody. Just a second. Is there anything else you find interesting about the paintings? Absolutely. This, this, all of this shit. Tell me... - What's this? - What's what? Is this supposed to be funny? Would you like me to pack the whole buffet for you? - Sure, go ahead, dumbass. - [Tschünni] I used to paint, too... - Mongo. - [Tschünni]...before I grew up, before I started to work like normal people. And paid taxes and contributed stuff to society with my work, not such rubbish just because I'm not that impaired and still paint like a big baby. Is there a problem? Klaus. Klaus! Do you have a problem with me? Well? - [plate shatters] - [guests gasp] - Okay. I... - [Ossi] You want a fight? Let's see if the training was good for something. [Ossi] Okay, calm down. [Isi] Thanks for the invitation. [Tschünni and Ossi laughing] - Hey, I learned a lot about art today. - [chuckles] Well, it should at least... work, I hope. - So we have a deal? - Yes. Hang on. - Ossi? What's up? - [Ossi] I'll get the money, dumbass. Arrange the fight! - Seriously? - Yes, man! - Where are you getting the money from? - Don't ask. Just arrange the fight. It was €5,000 upfront, right? You'll have it tomorrow. Sure. Okey-doke. By the way, Ossi, are you here with your grandpa, too? - Grandpa, huh? - I'm the bouncer at this hip-hop party and I just saw your grandpa. - [tires screeching] - [cars honk] Claudia. It's... It's completely normal, that... [chuckling] Completely normal, right. It's normal for a spoiled teenager to go off, take drugs, fuck around and want to become a chef. - Completely normal. - I wanted to say that... [sighs] It's completely normal that you... That you could be afraid that Isi... like... Like your... - My what? - My life experience is telling me that... Your life experience is that of a money preserver. You're here to increase your father's money. Why would you think that you of all people can tell me... Maybe because I can empathize far better with Isi than you can. And that's why I think that it would be important for you to tell her... about it. You'll sleep in the green room. I've had enough. Get lost. Go home, sleep it off and come back then. - Dumbass, where is he? - No clue. Look for him. [woman] Liar! I've had enough! - It's always the same with you, bitch! - You always... Stop it right now!

First I'm going to have a drink with my grandson. Hey, but come back! [Tschünni] Where did your good mood vanish to? Smile a bit. That was such a cool show! Not even the two of us could do that. I would love to have a grandpa like that. Just give him a chance. He's even getting us beer. That was so cool, man! What's wrong with you? Bernhard Knecht, who's that? Is that another Hitler or something? Who exactly is this fucking fairy over here? They don't say that anymore, they say hipster. - That's Tschünni. - Hi, Tschünni. Hi, Grandpa Ossi. I got the video from the guy who was filming it. And a friend of mine, Camilla, has a PR manager. You have to call him and show him the video. He loves stuff like that. Stop being so formal. What's this here? Are they crazy? Those bottles are only half full. Assholes. PR manager scam! How long have you been rapping for? It's really cool. That age and... He even reacted spontaneously to the guy. Your grandpa is actually intelligent. [laughing] Yeah, right. Hey, he's been putting down people all his life. He's good at that. - [Isi] No, he's really clever. - [Ossi] Look. He went to jail for shooting someone in the foot. He was supposed to get out after four years, but he hit someone and got another two years. Then he was out for a week, but couldn't deal with it and robbed a post bank. Thing is, it wasn't a bank, just a post office, and he stole fucking stamps. All in all, he spent 14 years in jail for stupid shit. [chuckles] Does that sound like an intelligent man to you? Will you transfer the €5,000 to me straightaway? [mutters] Um... - I wanted to talk to you about that. - What? - Thing is, my parents blocked my accounts. - What's this? - Yeah, but we'll manage. My parents... - Hey, are you fucking with me? I need this money by the day after tomorrow! We... - We'll go to my place and then... - Then what? We just need to apply some pressure. [door creaks] This is the only way to get into the house unseen. [Ossi] Turn on the light. [whispering] Just turn on the light for a second. - [Isi whispering] No! - Turn on the light. Just for a second. Holy fuck! Shut up! - How rich are you? - [Isi] Not a clue. Come on, I'll show you something. Seven thousand. Eighteen thousand. Sweet. Just this and we would have no debts. One hundred and fifty-two... Twenty-five thousand, okay? Something goes wrong, I'll smuggle these out and you'll get your money. Why does your mother have debts? We have a gas station. Her debts are €14,000. I owe the bank €3,000 for that, too. - You took out a loan for it? - Yes. No idea. The station is all my mother has. Whoa. [Isi chuckles] Antique sex toys. What... I get the dildo, but... What's this for? [both chuckle] You can try it out. It's all because of this. My grandpa invented it with 22. For engines. Fuck. All of this for a screw? Fuck me. Hey, how big is this here? Where are your parents? Yeah, we... We need to get some attention. - I don't want to push you into anything. - No. It's all good. You need your money. We'll just do it. - It needs to be authentic, right? - Yes. - Okay, let's practice. - What? [shudders] What is it? It was your idea. Yeah. Okay. [chuckles] So... can you please kiss me really trashy? - Kiss you trashy? - Yes. Trashy. Just trashy. - I can only kiss well, sorry. - [scoffs] [grunts] - Wait... - What? Why are you pushing me like... You... kiss really funny. I don't kiss funny, okay? I had a girlfriend before who didn't even like me. She was just with me 'cause I can kiss so well. - [scoffs] Okay. Congratulations. - Thanks. Okay, then... - Just push me against the stupid door. - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay, great, it's working. Great. - [breathing heavily] Okay. [clears throat] [vehicle approaching] [breathing heavily] - What... Stop! - What is it? - What? - Enough. - What are you doing? - Hey! - Just let me do it. - Just... I can do it myself. Okay, fine. [grunting] - What are you doing? - I'm taking off my shoes. [both struggling] [both chuckling] Can you do it? Yes? This is so crazy. Is this the craziest thing you've ever done? - I drove backwards into McDrive once. - You drove backwards... [door unlocks] [door opens] [Isi moaning exaggeratingly] [Ossi grunting and chuckling] [shushes] [Isi moans] That's enough! [Isi] Could you knock? - Enough, Isabelle! - Hey, careful! [yelling] With a monkey! Give it a rest! Ossi and me are a couple. Deal with it. - I can fool myself. - You don't believe it? Get out! Out of my house! Ossi stays! Just because you can't understand that two people can fall in love and be together for this reason. Yes, Dad. It's true, there are women who are with men because they fell in love with them! I know that's against your system! Sorry. [Manfred grunts] - I'm sorry! - [Ossi breathes heavily] Ossi, nothing happened. I'm sorry, I just... - I'm moving in with Ossi. - What? What? [panting and sighing] [gasps] [Ossi] Oh. Hi, Mom. Mom, this is Isi. Hello. Nice to meet you. Mmm-hmm. Okay. Here. [sighs] - The death glare. - My mom is okay. Just forget it. Okay, you sleep here, I sleep over there. MESSAGE TO CAMILLA Can I crash at your place? What do you want from your parents? Money? [sighs] They set up a deposit account for me that I'm supposed to get when I'm 25. But I want it now because... Because I don't want to go to college. I want to train to be a chef. Oh, cool. Yeah, I... - I think I would enjoy that a lot. - It's a mega cool job. [sighs] Thanks. For not laughing at my problems. You're just confirming my theory. That rich people are too stupid to be happy. [scoffs] Okay. Then explain that. Why am I not happy? When you're rich, you can do anything you want. But you don't because you're impaired. [chuckles] But I'm doing what I want. Training to be a chef in New York. Hey, maybe you can cook something here. But we only have shit. [rap music playing] No clue if these spices are still good. Okay. This is a challenge. [Betty] All of a sudden, she is standing in front of me and she wasn't just fat. I swear, she had such a belly, I swear, down to her thighs. [Ossi] And you congratulate her on her pregnancy without knowing for sure. - You just wanted to annoy her. - No! - She was pregnant! - But I know her. She's fat. - And Tschünni still only jerks off to you. - Stop it. Okay, I'm now officially gay. - Hi, Grandpa. - What's going on? - Cooking? - [Ossi] Okay, so you're gay now. - A gay rapper. - I was waiting 45 minutes at the optician. - Then he called a lesbian first. - [Ossi] Stop talking shit. If you need to be gay in order to get served, then I'm gay. Maybe they just thought you are homeless. - [chuckles] - [Ossi's grandpa] You weren't there. By the way, the PR jerk thought my video was really cool. He had seen it before, on the Internet or something. Really? Cool. I've just spent 14 years in jail... and this is by far the ugliest dinner I've ever seen. [Betty] Try it first. [Oscar's grandpa grunts] [Betty clears throat] It's actually tasty. - Somehow it is. - [Ossi's Grandpa] Mmm. - That shit isn't bad. - How did you do that? - [Ossi's Grandpa] Really nice. - [chuckles] Thanks. Mm. Is there any more? Sure. Mmm. Mmm. [indistinct music playing] [indistinct laughter] DAD 3 MISSED CALLS [exhales] [Camilla grunts] Good night. [automated voice] Good night, Camilla and Isi. The granny of a friend died last night. I didn't want to wake you. Shit. Emotional support, huh? [chuckles] Do you always eat your Nutella with a roll? Sometimes. Did you enjoy it? Mmm? - Hmm? - I noticed something. You're an asshole. - [chuckles] - It's true. You're totally unfriendly. You don't say "enjoy your meal" or "cheers" or "bless you" when someone sneezes. I thought the rich were at least friendly. She didn't even notice I didn't reply. She doesn't care. So, you're an asshole because you assume others are, too. I can't say things like that. I never could. Why do you say "enjoy your meal," huh? "Enjoy your meal"? The worst is when my parents have wine in the evening and clink glasses and go, "À votre santé." - Total jerks. - [chuckles] Seriously. Oh, my god. Such jerks. And when someone sneezes, I'd like to say, "Sneeze less loudly. That's gross." Because people just say it without meaning it. Yeah, maybe. - I can count letters. - I don't get that transition. You say something weird, then I say something weird. And what does "counting letters" mean? - Say a word. - Word. - No, a long word. - Declaration. - Eleven. - What? Letters? Mmm-hmm. - Um... Discontinuity. - It needs to be a word I know. Apple-juice-tree. - Fourteen. What's that supposed to be? - Peanut-butter-resistant. - Peanut with two Ts? - No, with one. Twenty-one. [exclaims] No clue. I just can. It's like a compulsion. There was this damn show, what was it called? - Wanna Bet? - Yes, exactly. Right. As a child, I wanted to go there. [chuckles] What else would that shit be good for? What? You're taking after your grandpa. Mmm. Mmm. - I'm now also very intelligent? - Well... If you or your grandpa had grown up like me... with all the fucking money, the school, the support, then, I don't know, you would study astrophysics and not do this shit. What shit? I don't do shit, I box. - I'll show you how I do shit. Come on. - [scoffs] [Manfred] They mentioned us in Manager Magazin. [chuckles] Among the 50 richest families in Germany. We can't let them get away with this. It'll be a hefty lawsuit. - Centered, it needs to be centered. - I already have the lawyers here. Now, of all times, while Isi is with that trashy guy in Mannheim, practically a sitting duck for kidnappers. Manfred, it's really funny. We miscalculated a little. You have around 27 million more than the last estimate. You're not supposed to make us richer, you're supposed to pretend we're just normal boring multimillionaires. Christ! - [Claudia] Manfred. - Sorry. You want to give her €3,000 a month? Yes, if she goes to college. Plus the best cooking class available near the college. Can't hurt, right? Maybe that will make her see sense. Right, left, very good. Great! Your cover, where's your cover? [Isi chuckling] [chuckling] Well done! - Too skippy. - Okay. Very good. That'll make you sick. - What did he say? - Not a clue. [in English] Double trouble, bitches! [groans] [in German] Right, okay. I think I should do some serious training. Ossi! You need to go to the gas station sooner. I need to drop into the workshop for the electric pump. I haven't trained properly yet. I can't go. Sorry, but it can't be helped. It's important. Hello? Is there anything else, young man? Right. No worries. - You work there? - Part-time. And that's not a problem for becoming a pro? - I have to. - Party tonight. Right? You come, too, Isi. Party tonight. [scoffs] You just want me to pay for everything, but I don't have anything. [Tschünni] In Mannheim, you don't need money to party. Sorry, the rich don't know how to party. - Of course I do. - [Tschünni] Then join us tonight. And no ten hours of beauty sleep. DAD [ends call] Isi? [sighs] She declined my call. I'll ring Klaus. Turn that shit off. Just the canister today. Keep the change. Ciao. [door closes] [sighs] ALL FILL UP AT BETTY'S Ossi! What are you doing? We're open for another 20 minutes. There's nobody coming, anyway. I need to go. I'm meeting people. Rubbish, open up! I wanted to show Grandpa the station. - Hey! - "All fill up at Betty's," great. [chuckles] [chuckling] Yeah. This shit is not that bad. [chuckles] And that's where the electric pump will go. Right. Sci-Fi. They can charge their Internet there, too, huh? Yeah. You really have built something here, my daughter. Business. Clink, clink. And the money rolls in. - Really cool. - [Ossi] You can stay. I'm off. Wait, Oscar. Where's the party? - Nowhere for you, man. - Come on, there's something to celebrate. I got a record deal! - Don't talk shit, man. - No shit. A record deal and a producer. Yes, I have a record deal. - Seriously? - Where's the party? [rap song playing] [in English] Shots. Shots, man. [in German] Can we have shots? [camera shutter clicking] [sniggering] [Tschünni] Hey! - [Isi] Are you happy? - [Tschünni] What? - Are you happy? - Yes. See that woman there? She gave me her number. - I'll send her a dick pic. - Hey! Are you crazy? Stop it! - Hey! Hey! - [chuckling] Look at me when I'm talking to you. A dick pic is an honest thing. You know why? She'll know what she gets. What does your father do? - Construction. - And your mother? Don't ask about my mother while I'm sending a pic of my dick! What does your mom do? What's her name? Do you like your mom? Shut up and pay attention to her reaction. - You'll learn something. - You're lucky if she doesn't report you. Just wait. MOM PHOTO SENT [screams] - Don't talk about my mom! - But you can see whether she's seen it! My mom has no fucking WhatsApp. That was an MMS. Are you worried she might see your dick or that she'll send you a pic back? [laughing] [Tschünni yelling indistinctly] - [Isi] Is he there? - [Ossi] There he is. Tschünni! Tschünni, man! Hey! Check on the table. On the table, man! Table, man! Table! [all] Turn round! Now she is there. Oh, fuck. [indistinct shouting] - [Ossi's grandpa] Oh, oh, oh. - [laughing] [Ossi's grandpa] Oh, boy. - Run! - She's seen it! [indistinct shouting] [techno music playing] Well, there's that really awesome boxing management in Frankfurt. Then you have to go there. Not possible. [chuckles] Ossi, do you believe in your talent? Do you really seriously believe in your talent? Then you have... You can't always stay in that gas station. Why are you so interested in this? I have fans in Mannheim. That's a good foundation, isn't it? Why... What do you want from me? Nothing will come of us. We might as well make out. [chuckles] She knows Klaus is filming here. Come on, this is staged. [upbeat song playing] [keys jangling] [grunts] [chuckles] - Okay? - Fuck. Please. [Isi chuckling] [Ossi] Where are my fucking spices? [Betty] Have you lost it? What's wrong with you? - Mom! [laughing] - Do you know what time it is? It's late. - Are you drunk? - Mmm-mmm. If you're not up to the mark tomorrow, I'm telling you, you'll be at the station. I don't care if you're having a bad day. - Give me a kiss. - [blows raspberry] You stink, asshole. Isabella, why did you take your T-shirt off? [Isi] Because I'm warm. What a stupid question. I don't think your mom likes me. My mom loves you but she has a problem with Illuminati. I'm no Illuminati. All millionaires are Illuminati, bitch. [chuckling] No. You're just jealous we're rich and you're not. Go cry. And actually, we're billionaires, bitches. - [retches] - Fuck, man! [chuckles] [exhales heavily] What did you do to me? Hmm? What did you do to me? I was never... - drunk. - Yeah, right. [chuckles] [indie-pop song playing] [chuckles] We used to have a picture like that in my parents' bedroom. They were lying there like this. So close and cuddling. As a child, I thought that was weird. I thought... something was wrong. Why are they lying there like that? They never do that otherwise. It was so strange. [Ossi exhales] Hey. Wake up. Hello. [grunts] Your parents are here. Yes? Okay. Isi, you win. Please come home with us now. You'll get your deposit account, all of the money. No more provocations. Understood? Good, get your things. Right, okay. Um... I need to go to work first. I should be fair and stay on for a few days, until they find someone else. [sighs] Okay, yeah. That's fine. But this... is over. Tell me that this is over. Yeah, sure. Fine. - Well, then... - Then... [sighs] MONEY TRANSFER Okay. It's working again. I've transferred it to you. [clears throat] Ossi. Um... Are you really sure you don't want... to use the money for your career? Is this your last advice before you go? Hmm? Forget it. What's the billionaire's suggestion of how I should invest my money? Did you just seriously suggest I abandon my mom? Ossi, you've already incurred debts for her. You're not used to that, right? A family sticking together to make ends meet. [scoffs] Forget what I said. Okay. Will you leave or... Why are you so aggressive? Because I'm sick of it, okay? I'm sick of people like you. You have no idea what it means to my mom, who never had anything, and had such a father, who had to raise me on her own, what it means to her to have something. But to arrive here and fucking... [sighs] I'm sorry for what I said. Bye. Okay, um... - We don't have to... - Hey, no issues. You have your money, I have mine. Everybody's happy. Enjoy New York. Bye. [door opens] [door closes] Watch out! Are you okay? Marf. Marf! How much longer do you want to wait? Until Gabriella kills someone? Hey, did you call me? Yeah... Gabriella, get changed. You're fired. [sighs] [coach] Well? Now like this. Now duck in. Now what's this? Show some moves! Step on it! Go on! Properly! Proper hits! Are you asleep? What are you doing? Come on, three undercuts! Come on! Ossi, Vukovic will beat you to a pulp! What's wrong with you? The deposit account has been closed. You have access to the money now. [Claudia] You make your own decisions now. And I hope you'll act responsibly. LOG IN OVERVIEW OF FINANCES [exhales] AGGREGATE BALANCE ANONYMOUS DONATION MONEY TRANSFERRED [sighs] LEGENDE - FOREIGNERS EVERYWHERE (OFFICIAL VIDEO) Oh.

I could never... never ever be with someone like Ossi. - Why do I miss him? - It's your hormones. Or an emotionally triggered metabolic misfunction of your brain. It's also called being in love. It happens, and it also goes away again. [sighs] Yeah, you're right. Of course I'm right. I hope it's gone by tomorrow. I need to forget about him quickly. This is no good. Good night.

Two things do not belong into the ring. Girls... - and Heidelberg. - [Ossi's grandpa] Oscar! - I'm an Internet star. - I don't give a fuck. Hey, I signed! On the Internet, I mean... [stuttering] Internet and... label. They set up an account for me with €30,000 in it. You know what that means? Here. I'm paying for the fight myself. My grandpa is sponsoring me. I don't want your money. - Ossi, it's your money. - I don't want your damn money. [stutters] There's no reason to shit on me like that, okay? - I have always been honest with you. - Honest with me? You were going to fleece me, remember? God, yeah, as if that would have hurt you, - a few thousand less. - [scoffs] So I'm a bad person now for giving you money to help me? But it's completely fine when you hurt my feel... Hurt your feelings? What? [chuckles] - I'm laughing my head off. What feelings? - Yeah, right. Rich people like me don't have feelings. They're just for poor, trashy Ossis like you. You had such a hard life. You know what? I don't want to talk to you at all. Glad this shit is over. Guess how I feel. I had to change my sheets to get that stench out of my room. [scoffs] What? Yeah, that's right. You're a bit smelly! I had to wash it all at 90 degrees, along with my sports gear. Boy, Ossi! You live in stench! Did you never notice the moldy spot in your room that's so disgusting? Why does no one clean that? What's your mom doing all day? [exhales] - Fuck you, Isi! - Fuck you! You know what? You're pathetic and unhappy, and you'll stay like that your whole fucking life! Yeah, right, and you'll be happy at your gas station job?

How do I find a real man, a real rich one? Are there special ads you can run? - How did you find dad? - [Manfred smacks table] Isi! Let's assume I'm like you. I'm looking for a really rich guy? I don't have to change my name, at least. Was that enough back then? To change your name to sound aristocratic because the rich marry among themselves? Okay, Isi, enough. Or did you have to get pregnant first? You were pregnant at the wedding. Was I your System D to get rich? No. Your life is a fucking lie. [Tschünni] Jab. Two double hooks. One left, two rights. [coach] Again! Give it to him! [coach] Again! That's it! - Give it to him! - [grunting and groaning] [Tschünni] Come on! [coach] Give it to the fatso! Go on! Fuck! Cunt! [exhales] This is your grandmother. It's the only photo I kept of her. It was not a lie that she died young. The photo was taken when I was two. She locked me in the car so she could party. [chuckles] The police came only after a few hours and rescued me. [sobbing] I kept this photo... so it would always remind me where I came from. And why I changed my name. We have something in common. Neither of us want to be like our mothers. I'm sorry. [cell phone chimes] CAMILLA You might be interested in this - [Ossi] She has a problem with Illuminati. - I'm no Illuminati. [Ossi] All millionaires are Illuminati, bitch. No. You're just jealous we're rich and you're not. Go cry. And actually, we're billionaires, bitches. [gasps] [exhales] DRUNK BILLIONAIRE [breathing heavily] Jerk. YANNIS V MANAGEMENT YANNIS VUKOVIC Ossi. All debts are paid. It's over. [chuckling] We're up and running! Hello? Can you be happy? [cell phone ringing] Yes? What? Dumbass... What? How... Backed out? Not again, man. Man, dumbass! [yelling] Fuck, man! Fuck! [sobbing] Bad. LOG IN BANCA CORVINO GERMANY - ONLINE BANKING [gasps] NEW ISI BURGER Okay. Not bad. First time I'm eating in this fucking joint. Enjoy your meal. Good day, Isi. How are you? Wow, Gabriella! You look great! Thanks. I'm fine, too. A cheeseburger, please. Thank you, chop-chop. Wow, you're really rich. Yes, I'm very rich, but I only did it for fun. Keep the change. I'm going back to Milan, where I am very rich. See you never again. [chuckles] [yelling] Are you fucking with me or what? Huh? Fuck you! You gave them money so they could back out! - Are you out of your mind? - Police are on the way. You uploaded the video, jerk! And you think that's the same? Get lost! If the police catch you... - I don't give a fuck! - Don't say your name and go! [breathing heavily] What kind of a person are you? [cell phone chimes] Same! TSCHÜNNI - Bro your grandpa is out to get that dumbass rapper - I need your car. - What? My mom has mine, I need yours. Grandpa will go to jail otherwise, okay? Give me your keys or your car. Help me! Please! [Isi] Why does he have to go to jail again? Because some rapper dissed him on the Net. I told the old fart not to open his cake hole too wide. Then he shut up. And I just hit him, I hit him from the right, from below, I wiped the floor with him. Hey, asshole! Embarrassing grandpa, my ass! - I'll smash your face in! - Fuck off, stupid grandpa! Get lost! - [grunting] - Hey, let go of him! - No! Let go! - Stop it, man! [Ossi's grandpa] I'm not taking any shit from him! Idiot! Fuck them! Fuck them all! Idiots! [sobbing] [Ossi's grandpa] I don't even know what fucking planet I'm on anymore. There are hipsters and assholes everywhere! [Ossi] You beat up 20-year-olds to go back to jail? You don't think I see what's going on here? You were scared of being outside. That's why you were rapping. Okay, but you need to stick with it. Adapt a bit. That's how it's done. Always the same shit with these things. You have no clue, man. That's just how you flip. Flipping through the Internet on your phone. And why are they all driving big fat jeeps in the middle of the city? - What's that shit about? - I know, it makes no sense. - Where are they going? - [Ossi] It's just the way it is. And I need to... online... digital... prisoner release number, appointment... shit like that. - You have to make an appointment? - What? - Do you have to make an appointment? - Yes. I don't have an identity card. - You have no ID card? - No. That's shit, too. [sighs] Okay, I'll help you. We'll get you an ID card. - Okay. - Okay? - But you stay calm now. - Sure, I'll be calm. Smartass. Grandson. [chuckles] Yeah, me, too. Fuck. Smartass. [belches] - [door closes] - [clears throat] Sorry about the video. I didn't want to admit... that someone like me could fall for someone like you. [breathes heavily] You don't stink, okay? [chuckles] I just wanted... that it... You smell nice. Too nice. [sighs] I never felt bad about my family before. Or that we only get the cheap stuff. I never noticed the mold in my room. That I'm called Ossi and I have no clue about fucking eating etiquette. I never gave a fuck about any of that. And then you came along, and all of a sudden I feel like trash. I would always feel like trash next to you. [sighs] I'll call Yannis' manager. I'll set things straight. I'll take down the video. Dumbass, the fight will take place. That's final. And I'll win. Got that? Dessert for rich kids ♪ coke ♪puke [Camilla] My dad's dick is even smaller than I thought. It wasn't enough to buy me a Tesla, so now I have a Jaguar I-Pace. God, not that again. Of course we deliver into war zones. Where else? Are they supposed to shoot each other in the streets? There are not enough countries in the world. It's about time Mars will be colonized so I can finally go on holidays again. Yeah, I discussed it with my dad and he is thrilled. It means I can start out in his company and achieve something while studying. But can you? I mean, achieve something? Regardless of what you will achieve, you'll owe it to your grandfather's money. Will it ever feel like true success? Yes, thanks. Anyway, it's the chance of a lifetime. I just need to pick the perfect time for it. Come over if you want. I only had one hour of training. - What's so important? - Uh, Ossi... Um... That Isi, right? You'll have to go for it again. The electric pump, there is some... insurance thing, total rubbish, but we'll manage. We're missing 2,000. And for repairs, right? We need to invest some more. 4,000 will be more than enough. But it's not a problem, just go for it again. Hmm? I'm not throwing any more money out the window. What? I want to box, Mom. Properly. I need to go to Frankfurt. I need proper management. What's going on? What's this rubbish? It's not rubbish. - I'm not part of this anymore. - Calm down, buddy. Please, Mom, okay? - Close this place down. - What? - Find a job, okay? - What? I mean... - What's this rubbish... - Look for a job! Ossi! Stay here! Ossi! Ossi! Wait! Stay! I can't get a job! I never learned anything! Camilla, you're the most intelligent person I know. - Poor you. - More than two million in my account - and I feel shitty. - Maybe you have a cold. Camilla. Seriously, I didn't earn this. I didn't do anything for it. Why does this money belong to me? What did you want the money for? For the cooking course in New York. So why aren't you in New York? Do you know why money makes me happy? Because I have a Camilla heart. It always jumps with joy when it gets money. You, however... You have a weird Isi heart. It gets no joy from money. It doesn't like money. It rejoices in different things. [chuckles] What I just said was really beautiful. "Only Friendship is more important than money" - me. [rapping] - Did you see my mom? - Relax. She will be here. - Concentrate on the fight. - My thoughts exactly. She's not answering her phone. Dumbass, you need to find her. I'm really worried. - [crowd cheering] - Hey! I'll find a job. I'm sorry. [Tschünni] I'm sorry, too. [sobs] [Ossi] Shut up. TAKE YOUR ABITUR [MC in English] Here's the reigning champion! Yannis Vukovic! [crowd booing] [in German] Go back home, Santa! Look him in the eye. Do not show any fear. Does he have Abitur or what? - Hi, how are you? All good? - Hello. He's very nice, man. [both grunting] [MC commentating indistinctly] Yes! - Keep going! - That's it! [Betty] Fight back! [inhales sharply] [coach] Stay awake! Ossi, block him! [Betty] Defend yourself, man! Show him! Let him have it! [Tschünni] What's going on, man? [bell dings] [panting] [coach] You need to surprise him. That asshole can read minds. Ossi! Listen, you need to startle him. [all talking indistinctly] [mumbles] Keep quiet! He always knows what I'll do. He can read my mind. The dumbass has Abitur. EMERGENCY EXIT [crowd exclaims] [both grunting] [Betty] He'll kill him. [exclaims] He needs to throw in the towel! It's not happening. I can't watch! [bell dings] [tinnitus ringing] [panting] [imperceptible] - [talking indistinctly] - Huh? I bought the burger joint. I know it's completely crazy, but I've never felt as alive as I do with you. Everything was crazy! - [Betty] What's she doing there? - It's fine. He needs that. - [Tschünni] It's all good. - I don't want to go to New York. And I won't be talked out of being in love with you. I want to want what I want and not what I think I want. I want you. And you're not trash. You're perfect. - Are you okay? - Great. [chuckles] And the most important thing - I want to tell you is... - [bell dinging] [crowd clamoring] [grunting] [winces] [exclaiming] [grunts] [crowd exclaims] [panting heavily] Hey, Ossi! Ossi, hey! - Ossi! - [indistinct chatter] I'll never take you to the opera. - Opera is the worst that there is. - Okay. And I will have your room refurbished. Can I still be called Ossi? Only if you don't laugh at me for having pedicures. One step towards me. Okay. I don't even know what that is. [referee in English] Ready? [Isi in German] So, you want to win now or... - [referee in English] And box! - [Ossi chuckles] [coach in German] Come on! [cheering] [both grunting] [crowd clamoring] [Betty shouting] Yes! And again! [yelling indistinctly] [referee in English] One... two... three! He's out! [crowd roars] [screams] [in German] I'm happy! Lanky! I'm so happy! [chuckles] [rap song playing] [narrator] There. They got together after all. But of course, some questions remain unanswered. Will Grandpa really make it as a rapper? Will Betty find a job? Does Camilla want a trashy guy, too, and snatch Tschünni up? And of course, how will things go for Isi and Ossi? But for the first time in Isi's life, no one knows what's coming. And that's okay, because that's how life fucking is!
