I don't think so It's a bit untidy I have sacked the housemaid Where's your family? - They're away - Away? I sent them on a holiday to Crimea This is your house - Shall I show you around? - Yes, I'd like that I was holding an audition here for a new maid I had a horrible old lady who made nasty food I want a young one stroking my hair and reading Pushkin The decoration is awful, my wife did this The wallpaper and these curtains. It used to be nicer This is my wife's room I brought this mirror from Petrograd It was made by Constructivists Mirror all around. A very nice piece of work You don't live together? I'll come to that Do you all live and work here? It's for well-earned scientists. This is my son's room Dionysis - What's his name? - Dionysis. Denis He plays here Toys Little toys This is a whirligig Do you know how to play it? Why is there a second bed? For the nanny A little girl This is where my wife sleeps What is the room downstairs for? Her belongings Something to drink? We have wine, very good Armenian cognac - Let me help you - Thanks Let me put your coat here Shall we I thought I'd meet your wife and son Right It's good to see you, I'm very glad You haven't changed at all - That's not true - You haven't - No, I have - No Let's go I found some food You can still find food, even at night This is my friend and colleague Scientist Alexey No, you, you tell me This is my wife Nora. And my child She's beautiful. And your son too How old is he? - Seven years old - And here? There he's three two, two and a half Do you want to be alone? Yes See you in the morning You haven't changed. Your hair's just a bit grey What did I look like? Tell me about yourself What exactly? What's been going on all these years? - Did you get married? - No Why? I never found anyone I wanted to be with Someone you could share your life with? Someone I could share my life with It's always a gamble I never believed I could share my life with Nora We were different, but back then being different was exciting It felt like exploring a new continent Like trying new fruits It was very tempting I fell in love Life continued. One day she got pregnant I got married Did you have affairs? A lot The agreement was I bring the girls home - Who? - The girls - What? - I brought them here I wanted to have an open marriage so I could meet other girls with different flavors and feelings I wanted to enrich my experience she would have the right to do the same. And we would continue to love each other This is impossible in a relationship Why? Because it is This is your opinion Yes I thought its possible This is cold. You wait Now the hot one is getting hotter so you minimise the hot You sound like a scientist Don't sit here. Pull this Where do I sit? Over there? Careful, very hot water might come first - So I sit there - Check it first Then move under it To turn the water on again you wait you check it, then you move Now turn it off You want to try? I've already set it up - Turn it off - It's not a drought They have many rivers here I can't stand the sound of running water It's a result of living in Greece - I can't stand it - Grow up When you go back to Greece If at some point you go to Constantinople I will give you the address of where I was born Where were you born? I want you to see it In my dreams, you have lived there It might not matter to you You might not notice it. There may be many like it The address might not exist anymore Someday we will meet in Constantinople again When I went to other lands Searching for my true homeland, the land of dreams and memories I got scared when I realised that my first homeland had forgotten me Like on a long journey, when the coach stops so you can pee When you get out you find a magical world You talk to fairies, and when you go back to get the others to come and see they've all gone, and left you behind All my dreams take place in the house where I was born Every experience I've had takes me back there Like we've strayed from our path and we're trying to find the Golden Fleece The golden rule that will lead us back to that coach But the coach has gone They waited only 15-20 minutes Like friends, relatives, lovers promised us eternal love Soon, they're gone Love affairs are nice, but we have things to do It's called being an adult I'm an "anti-adult" I'm not a kid, I'm an "anti-adult" It's a great blessing playing spin-the-bottle And kissing an innocent girl for the first time It's a real blessing. Like getting butterflies But you have to go back to it without bitterness, without pain That's being an adult - Go back to where? - Go back there without bitterness, without pain You have to let yourself do this I think you're happy with your life Yes I am Are you happy? Sometimes Is that when something good happens or do you wake up happy? It bursts out of you by itself That's real happiness When it jumps out of you I've felt like that This sounds cliched but I've felt it over really small things Really small There are no small things. If they have this effect, they're big I've felt it Even in this dramatic political situation I can feel happy I can You feel happy because you're used to feeling bad Our conversations come from a biological perspective You're used to feeling very bad At some time when its over you are happy yes you fell like a human. When they stop torturing you Then it starts again I wonder who's torturing you - I don't know - Who? You talk of torture But I was lying on that sofa and that girl was reading Pushkin to me I wonder what would happen if you ever had an equal relationship with someone I'd like that Sure It's 4.30 in the morning You're on Greek time No, Moscow time It's 5.30 Really? That's Greek time Mine says 4.30 Greek time is 4.30, Moscow time is 5.30 Is my watch on Greek time? - Sorry - What? Sorry that ruined your mood, I'm an adult now You shouldn't have told me I'm growing up Stating the harsh truth You can take the suitcase - Do you have a toothbrush? - I do - Try our Soviet toothpaste? - I have everything - Do you? - Of course It's dawn already? - It really is! - It gets light very early here Why? How? It is 5.30 Right Fine What a wonderful morning! May I go out? Incredible! Incredible! Just incredible! - Is this all your balcony? - Yes That's where you'll sleep You'll be naked. I'll come and look in at you Do you really have to do that to see me naked? You know scientists are working now? - Right now? - Right now Hello? What's going on? We're waiting Yes Are there no more candidates? Group the candidates and send them here We need to prepare the clothes for them How many do we have? One, two, three, that's enough - Four? - And one is there. Go in - Hello - Hello Please sit down Thank you - Shall I get you a glass? - No Right then Thank you Light the candles, Lyosha Girls, housemaids We can talk about poems, about dreams, about love Lyosha Take the girls to change Into the things you've chosen? Choose the right colour for each one Alright I don't like mosquitos A person who can feel and give love... Dau Do they need slippers? No It's a bit unusual, isn't it? Hold your fingers like this This is your symbol And Nastya You will have this. Just hold it - Alright - During the test Let's start with the Pushkin Read it out A small excerpt from here "Russian, Russian, why, oh why Not knowing where thy heart did lie Did I give myself up to thee for good? Not long upon thy breast Did this maiden rest her dream-filled head And, yes, at fate's behest Few joyful nights were granted her in bed Will they ever again come back? Is it true that joy is gone for good? Oh, prisoner, thou surely could Have tricked my youth and my lack Of experience, by pitying me And feigning kindness silently I would have eased thy doleful plight With tender care that knows no end I would have watched over thee through the night Guarding the sleep of my anguished friend" Let's have a small revolution Redecorate I will give you grades I told them to redecorate, take out everything we have in the fridge, everything that's good What do you think of the blonde? Does she read Pushkin better? She has better perception - What? - Yes, better perception I agree Anya, there's too much here The architecture of the table is bad Move the horse and screen Make a cosy area in this house Nastya Don't take just two things Sorry Anya we need a quick implementation of fantasy and imagination More poetry Nastya, where's your imagination? - You have to fly - I'd love too I'm giving you a chance to make me happy There's no youthfulness Girls should be running around with grapes making decisions She has the right idea running around the rooms, finding ways to make the house more beautiful The roosters should go in the kitchen They come and the whole house changes That's the revolution Don't be shocked, the girls are doing nothing wrong Did I say anything? Now we're talking! Your herbs are no good Get rid of them if they're so bad Bravo Pronto We've got a bit of life going now, Dau - Can you feel it? - Yes, of course Now this statue doesn't fit in You need to put it at the very top so that everything moves towards it Maria lie down if you want I can give you a massage I don't want a massage Come on, don't be so What? It's lovely having these girls running around It's a circus What's wrong with that? Should it be a mausoleum? Why ask me? I didn't say anything Excuse me It's true that joy is gone for good All the same, girls Hang on I don't like the horse being there The horse? He should be one of our guests Let's move him closer Try sit on him and you will understand him - Have you sat on him? - Sure It's the first thing every guest does It's a tradition - Well? - It's cold Cold Let's move it Let's turn him around So that he faces us There we go Why am I doing it alone? Towards you, girls Further - Are we sitting him - At the table Interesting Let's try Here we go Why don't you sit down? It's true that Joy is gone for good Joy is gone for good The other way round It's true that joy is gone for good Can I ask, who's going to eat? I'm not Let's drink to joy Somebody hasn't got a glass No, it's not gone for good Katya, get yourself a glass We are drinking to joy! What's your toast? Dau, to you Any questions? You, me? Fine - Thanks - To Dau Now they're learning Maria Dau it's getting late should we see the girls out? - They need to get home - Very well - Go and get changed. Thanks - Thanks, girls Sorry What for? It's late Not at all Did I upset you with the girls? You haven't upset me, I'm concerned you are so miserable. Bye Do you want to be auditioned too? Do you think the girls liked it? Did you like it? Why wouldn't I? - You did - I did I made them work Indeed They did their job. The horse was moved The horse and the sofa All done The vases have gone This is great. Trifonov put it there Why did you invite me here? Don't you know? You're putting me in a difficult position You know Because you're my soulmate Whatever happens, you're my soulmate Why didn't you show me then? I did Dau, you didn't. You ran away Back then was the hardest time of my life Truly I mean it was like the whole universe that was full of colour, taste, texture darkened and became covered in the thick frost that still covers it Within one minute my whole youth fell apart inside me all my plans and dreams everything became a lie You're not to blame I felt guilty about you You were perfect But fate tore me to pieces and kept me down What fate? I don't understand I don't understand It doesn't mean I didn't love you I never felt you didn't love me I always loved you Even if 25 years have passed You must feel it And you know I always was and will be ready to face indifference on your part and criticism I deserve it Nevertheless I want you to know Back then, you wrote me a letter I mentioned this yesterday In the letter you wrote "Whatever happens whatever comes I will always dream about you" Do you remember? Many times I have felt as though I wrote that letter Because the great secret was deep inside we are the same Deep inside we're made for each other I don't know when you realised that It was obvious from the very first moment Of course There were very hard moments when I was sure you would never want to see me again in your life There would never be anyone in my life? ...never want to see ME again I did feel like that at first I remember I can feel that because we're made for each other The funny thing is, I feel for you I've never understood anyone the way I understand you So I can't be angry with you - Because we're the same - Maybe I don't know why, but I really understand you So - I understand you too - Completely I understand you too I can't be angry with you I love you I respect you so much I forgive you I forgive you, really You're a better version of me You're the only man I could let be free You haven't even taught me tango or chess What do you want, chess or tango? Tango! Let's teach you The main thing is to feel your partner You follow my legs Like this I step with my right, you with your left And back - The other leg - Left We turn, with the other leg The other leg! We turn again That's it. First lesson - Shall we go upstairs? - Yes Let's go? You've really changed Maybe that's because I'm here for three days only After three days, the beast will reawaken I locked it You've locked it away - Cheers - Cheers Do you feel like you've changed? - No - No? Maybe you've changed so you think I have Maybe I have I'd like to explain my point of view so you understand me What you said before about how when someone tries to get close I run away It's partially true But it's not to protect myself I'm not afraid of being approached or of being hurt by the love of the other person It's not that I don't want to accept it I'm afraid I'm afraid of a commitment where notions are materialized I've always been preoccupied with such notions I'm afraid of losing this erotic stream in me I'm a great admirer of emotions To an extreme level I could even sacrifice life itself for emotions That's like if you visit the Louvre and you see a beautiful painting and you're an admirer, but you didn't create it You see the painting, but not every day So it doesn't lose its magic I agree distance is good But that's not the problem We lived far apart That wasn't the problem It was something else Other problems Explain - Hi - Hi Hello Nice to meet you too You're back? - When did you get back? - Just now - How is it there? - Sunny Sorry, I didn't know she was coming. Sit down Sit with us. Have a drink Why is it so messy? I'll tell you later But she doesn't understand She doesn't understand anything It's not important I want to change our maid We need renewal in our life I gave her some days off Two or three days And I was looking for alternatives A separate maid for you You mean one each? Why do you need a maid? To play football with To play football? Why not? How was it there? Good. The child is staying for now I thought so. Why did you come back? I missed you And you? I missed you too Good The horse is running in a different direction It's at the table You were clearly missing someone I've forgotten her name I said you were missing someone so you got the horse to join She says we must have been lonely so we got the horse Who is Maria? What is she doing in our institute? Maria is a famous actress She's a guest She's my - she's from Greece An old acquaintance I've never heard of her Did she become famous recently? She has been for a while We were friends even before you and I met I was eighteen, twenty Very well - Is she staying with us? - Yes - Did you show her our son? - Yes Tell her it's beautiful How does she like our institute? Ask her, please - How are you finding the Institute? - Very impressive Very impressive What impresses her the most? What's impressed you? - I was - Maybe that hammer over there? In Athens, in Greece in general we don't have buildings as big as grand Everything is smaller The buildings aren't as big in Athens Were you on holiday? - Were you on holiday? - Yes Did you enjoy it? Did you enjoy it? Yes, but I missed the whole family being together Yes, but she missed the family And your son? - And the child? - He missed it too He likes it when his daddy washes him But his daddy wasn't there She says that he likes daddy to give him baths, but daddy wasn't there Do you have a family? She doesn't What? They're on a trip. The theatre It's a cultural exchange She said no I realise she's here alone, I meant in general No She has a brother You didn't know I'd be here? You translate that She believes you didn't know Maria would be here That Maria would be here? - That she was coming - I didn't Should I have known? Should she have? Is it something special? - Is it something special? - No, but I am staying in your house It's nothing special, but she's staying here so maybe you should have known But I didn't What does she live for? That's a stupid question - Why? - "What do you live for?" She can tell me that herself It's my opinion What's the meaning of your life? What do I live for? Certainly not for a child Certainly not for children Obviously I don't have any particular purpose I just try to live every moment I'm given There's no specific reason she lives for She just tries to live every day she's given I don't have any expectations She has no expectations Not even any dreams? You have no dreams? I do, I want to be healthy and for the people I love to be healthy too Her dream is to be healthy and for all those she loves to be healthy too I don't really believe that What do you dream of? What do you dream of? I always dream of being free And when I'm free I dream of not being free She dreams of being free and when she's free she dreams of being committed A vicious circle It seems like an honest answer, but not for HER That's a good answer not just from you, but in general Does she need a family? Do you want a family? Ideally, yes In an ideal sense, yes What's an "ideal sense"? - What is... - "Ideally?" Where there's love respect communication when people are willing to solve their problems But that's unusual I've never come across it So I'd rather be alone and free So She needs respect love, good communication People must want to solve their problems But she's never seen a family like that so she prefers to be alone Maria, do we seem like a couple to you? Ask her, please What do you think, Maria Are we a couple? Do we look like a couple? Be honest Say yes, of course you do Be honest Tell her to say what she feels Say what you feel You look like a couple - Really? - Really - Did she say yes? - Yes, we do That's what she said? I told you the truth It doesn't mean a good couple We know good and bad don't exist There's no such thing - Can I ask you one question? - Of course Do you think Maria and I look like a couple? Hypothetically See what I have to live with? - Every day - What happened? I asked her to be honest "Could Maria and I have been a couple?" - What? - That's what I asked Why did you do that? She has no right to get involved in my life It's her life too It's her house too Why did you ask her that? We have the same rights If she asks that, I can ask too I'm tired of hiding things That was brutal She comes home and sees another woman she had no idea she would meet You have no right to do that to her Under any circumstances. You're completely wrong I can answer Don't, I'm a bad person, a barbarian No. It's possible It's possible Translate, there are three people in this conversation She believes it's possible I doubt Maria did all this Who else was here? Trifonov and I had Why did you do that? I mean it Tell her we're very open here She mustn't get upset Say it was me, I asked first You say it, I can't translate that - Try - I can't remember any English Please, tell me what she's saying She says, it's fine, we're very open We say what we think we agreed on that before That was the contract we signed to live together Tell her I really like her I'm not part of this contract It's between you two. Tell her that I'm not part of it What? Maria isn't part of it We can say what we like to each other But she isn't part of that agreement to speak openly In short, I'm a bad person No, it's me Listen Nora - I'll stop now - Thanks Sorry Anyway How do you say "champagne"? You have no right to torture her like that No right at all You could cancel that contract if you wanted - I did - You didn't You continue a situation that leads nowhere you tyrannize yourself and this woman too She's blameless We agreed we have no relationship - Don't tyrannize her - How do I? It's inexcusable - I don't tyrannize her - You do! I give her a home, respect, anything I can I don't tyrannize her She had nowhere to go and nothing to do. I took her in - I did what I could - But you can't - be a dictator - How am I? Why did you ask her that? What was the point? We're not a couple. What was the point? We were a couple 25 years ago You've spent your whole life with her - You have a child - But why did she ask that? - Why? - I don't know It was a question for you two In the end, she came home and found another woman I doubt that was very pleasant You shouldn't be using me - I'm not - You are Is that why you invited me? That's disgraceful - A mistake - That's not why Don't use me in this quarrel with your wife Don't ever do it again - You're wrong - I'm wrong? I made you some tea, in case you want it Two, right? One will be enough Can we behave until I leave? - Dau? - I didn't do anything - Fine - Everyone has their own truth She has to understand that It's easy to play - the role - Of a victim You used me, so I got angry Do you understand me? I asked if we looked like a couple For what reason? There was no reason to say it Why did she ask that? I don't know I don't care about her, I care about you Let's behave. This is difficult and now I'm involved Help me Don't make it worse It's good Maria came She's a special person - What? - She says it's good you came You're a truly special person What's this Thank you There's "no why", right? I can't fix it it's all tangled up It always rains here I don't feel very good I don't know what's wrong I feel dizzy I think I'm going to do some work in the Institute - Let her sleep in my room - Alright What? You know, I don't think I'll be able to sleep There is some work I would like to finish I'm in the mood for this I'll go to the Institute now No need to move downstairs, you can have my room Are you leaving? Will you be back tomorrow at all? What? If you need to go, then go Wait, Dau There's something stuck to your back. There
