Dear Kawase Naomi, Happy brithday, Naomi! Congratulations, you're 24. I hope that your happiness will continue. Be a good daughter to your father. Please do your best to cheer him up. Love, Mum. Katatsumori My nose is running. I don't need my garden any more. I'm starting to show my age. So how can I tend it? You should, though. You're the only one who will. I'm getting old. They say you can't live with your parents forever. Eventually I will die. I'm still okay for my age. This is an azalea. Azaleas, freesias and violets in one pot. Look at this. So many in one box. These grow from cuttings. This one is also beautiful. - What is that? - It's a seed pod. They are violet seeds. They fall off and grow in the ground. You've grown, too, haven't you? How did I live to be 85? I've lived longer than my parents and all my brothers. Well, well. I've taken good care of myself. But you wouldn't know that. She is calling you. - Going to practice? - Basketball? Yes. Then I'd better make something to eat. What? I can't stand up. I haven't finished here. Look at the camera. I'm not finished yet. Look over here. I can't work. You're bothering me. There's an earthworm. How smoky! Hello, earthworm. You're hot, aren't you? The tomatoes have bloomed. Hope they bear fruit soon. I haven't put make up on today. I've no need to. Why not? I'm not going anywhere. I do when I go out. Yesterday I didn't, though. I want to go out. Where to? My friend's restaurant. But three people, that'll be expensive. I've almost got it. Except for this one. I can't get it. This one is in the way. See? Finally I did it. These are 480 yen. Two omelets cost 1,000 yen, so it's a real bargain. These pickles are quite sour. They're very nice. We both like the same things. We're parent and child. Are you filming again? Give it a rest! Stop shooting me all the time! Why? Good memories, I suppose. I won't die easily. I'll live till 100. I want to see your kids. See them at sports festivals. There's no limit to my wanting. I'll inherit the years of my brothers who died young. You are too close. Stop her, will you? Stop filming me all the time. I mean it. Please stop. Naomi, shoot yourself. Honestly, that's enough. Stop it. I'm falling over. Stop her. A few minutes is plenty. But she never stops. I'm always available. Enough. What did you get? Let me see it now. Big close-up. I don't like the big close-ups. - See you. - What? See you. What about dinner tonight? I'll be late today. So you'll eat out? I hate dealing with leftovers. What are these? They're peas. Sow them. How did you get them? From peas I grew last year. You harvested them last year? You'll sow them again? I've been drying these ones out. What's the merit in drying them. If you don't insects get to them. Insects go inside? Yes, they eat the inside. I dry them to avoid the bugs. When is the next harvest? In May or June. June? Sometime around May or June. I'll be 25 years old next May. - My birthday present. - Good idea. My next birthday present will be peas. You really want them? Those peas . . . They'll grow up to be my birthday present. A cat's been in here today. A cat? Have you seen one lately? Yes, he comes here and buries his dung. Hey Cat! Don't shit on my birthday present. What's this? I should dry them. Sorry to disturb you. This is your local paper recycler. If you have old newspapers, or old magazines, and cloth that you no longer need, I will exchange them for toilet paper, waste-paper bags or money. It's snowing. A little. Yes, a little. Not enough to settle. Have you finished filming me? Can I go back inside? It's cold. You are cold? - Your glasses! - Take them off? Have you filmed enough yet? It's still snowing. Yes, a little. But not enough to call it snow. It's not settling. Shall I film you? This wrinkled old face without any make-up on. It's so cold. Let's go inside. Come on. Don't waste film. Stop now. If you loan it to me, I'll shoot you. Shall I walk forward? I'll come forward. I'm shooting. - I am moving. - All right. You're not moving. Watch your step. I'm being careful. No, you aren't. I can see you, Naomi. Sugar is on sale today. Where? Million Supermarket. But you need coupons. I have two. Last time the eggs were 99 yen. But I had no coupon. A woman next to me gave me two. I gave one of them to another woman. Today I bought another pack. They were about 125 yen. The normal price is over 170 yen. You are making my life difficult. I am alone during the day. At night I wait for you to return. Often you don't. No time to talk to you. Too tired to enjoy talking to me. You take a bath and go straight to bed. Mornings, too. Even after I wake you up, you sleep for another 15 minutes. You have no time to eat the breakfast I prepare. You should eat breakfast. That's the source of your vigor for the day. You should eat a little. I wish you would. What are you doing, Naomi? Naomi. - I often see her. - Do you? - Hello. - Hello. Good day. Stop filming a good looking woman like me. She always does this. It's all she knows how to do. First time for me to work today. Yes, it is. You seem to be getting well. You spent days complaining about your pains. It's really difficult. It came off. Because I made it easier. Ouch! I cut my finger. You should be more careful. Put on some gloves. I couldn't find them. I have plenty. Why didn't you bring them? We can't do it without arguing. Then use mine. I don't have any. Mine are all mixed up. - Well, go and get them. - All right, I will. And some paper, too. All right. Be careful, they'll fly off. Be careful. I'm healthier than she is. I'm in good shape. Didn't you have a headache? Me? Oh, that's gone. A neighbour said I should go to the hospital. I did and they gave me a drip. And? Put your name. Ka ... wa ... Hard to write, is it? Yes, it is. I am writing my age. 80 years. Look this way, please. You forgot your first name. I'll do it now. How about I write my husband's? Better not. It's too soon to die. March 29, 1994 Kawase Uno, 80 years old. I should have brought snips to cut some sprigs. They don't allow that. I know I shouldn't. Are you recording my voice, too? I found a broken one. That's too short. The sign says: "help protect the trees." I know. They'll pickle the fruit later. We can buy flowers for 200 yen on Sundays. We bought some last year. Really? Did we really? I took you to kindergarten every day. I bought a bus pass and went with you. Every single day. For three years. You'd cry when I left. So I waited outside till kindergarten was over. For three years! Every day. I love you so much. I took great care to raise you properly. I took photos when you first started school. I was so happy. You were such a hussy. You raced around on roller skates. Remember those stilts you used to play with? At school you became a real little minx. Always on the slide, the parallel bars. Hanging upside down. Remember when you climbed up onto the roof of the old storehouse? What a job it was for me to go get you! When I took you walking I used a leash. Even if you don't believe it, it's true. I'm happy you've grown up so well. You didn't study much in the 2nd year of juniour high school. But by the 3rd year you studied hard. You passed the high school entrance exam. . . and studied English literature there. After graduation you studied photography. You worked at a company for ten months. Then you went back to the photography school and became a teacher there. From early morning until late at night you studied diligently every single day. You were a hard worker. You have strength of character. Naomi, I don't know how to ask you this. . . Do you love me? Do you still love me as I love you? You never say so, but. . . Grandma! What are you doing? I'm picking peas. I have to pick the peas. It's me, Grandma. How are you, dear? Are you all right? I'm fine. Look after the house while I'm away. Sky! Bugs! Sun! - Grandma! - What? People will think we're crazy. They really will. Naomi! What are you doing? I'm not doing anything. A rose's thorn! I feel silly, but . . . A thorn stuck on my nose. Yes, I have a thorn stuck on my nose. Little apples! Washing! A hoe! No, it's a mattock. A spider! No, I don't want it! A neighbour! Lee! A dog. Nandin bush! Clouds! Grandma? Asleep already? You're asleep? Good night. Good night . . . Grandma . . . Directed by Kawase Naomi.
