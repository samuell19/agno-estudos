[MUSIC] [GIGGLES] Hey! This is Rajnikanth’s movie. No way! This is Kamal Hassan’s movie. I bet that it is Rajnikanth’s movie. 1 rupee bet! This is Kamal Hassan’s movie. Hey! Keep quiet and come. We can watch the movie only if we successfully jump over the wall. Otherwise, we’d be screwed. Hey! Go… Keep quiet and go. Warden Sr. would screw us up if she finds out. You can worry about her taunts later. Shut up and come. Hey, Rani! Why did you decide to stay back in the hostel for the holidays instead of going home? Yeah! I’m with mom! I am just worried that I couldn’t spend time with her on Diwali. Okay! First, tell me whether this Rajni's movie or Kamal's movie. I have no clue what movie it is. Why should we even care about who the hero is? We’re watching a movie at night and come back to the hostel secretly. No! I cannot come. Hey! I will come with you. Don’t leave me behind. Don’t leave me behind. I am scared. Then, stay here. We shall go and come back. Stay here and watch the drama. Hey! It seems we’d come back. Anyone who isn’t afraid can come with me. Otherwise, you can stay back. Hold this! What’s that? I cannot reach it. Throw it to me. What’s this? Snacks! Is it really needed now? Come fast. What are you holding in the other hand? Inhaler! Otherwise, I’d be gone! Why would you think about watching a movie in such a situation? Hop on! Hey! Come fast. How long will you remain to be cowards? No! I am not as brave as you. You go and watch a movie. You can recite the story to us later. I must get back 1 rupee if it turns out to be Rajni’s movie. Bye… 1… 2… Jump! [VEHICLES HONKING] Hey, Goms! Don’t you think this is too much? Hey, come! Just 5 more minutes left. What can we see from here? Will you jump over the wall? Just for fun! Wait! Qatar Airways is written there, isn’t it? Hey… Will it come by this road? That’s called runway, not road. Runway? Hey! Hey. Hey! Look there. I hear something. – What? I hear it. You can’t see anything from here. Just see. Get up and see. Hey! I hear it again. See! I’ll be right back. Oh no! Hey… Check it. Hey. – Check it… Hey! Get down. Don’t spoil my car. Get down. – You don’t worry boss. Get down. – What? There it is. Look there. Get down. Don’t spoil my car. Oh no! – Is it coming? – Where? Yay… I can see it. Get off the car! Can’t you hear me? You peep out without listening to me. Bye… Have a safe journey. Goms? Feelings? I don’t understand one thing. How does a plane fly when it rains? It gets dripped while flying. Relax, Goms! You worked hard to give a good education to your son. He got a job abroad and left. It is your time. You have to live for yourself. Goms! Look at me. Surendra is a wonderful person. He gave us good gifts. He gave me a watch! What’s your gift? He never stayed away from me while pursuing studies. I was never away from him either. My neighbor used to invite me to hang out at the beach or go to movies. I gave her many excuses. The husband is different and the son is different, Prabha. You’d understand if you get married and have kids. Okay, madam! Shall I open the gift or not? No need! Leave me alone! Oh! Then, I’ll open it for sure. Wow! Goms! It’s a tab. Oh! [MUSIC] “Hey, girl! Your gaze is audacious” “Life could be awful or fortunate!” "With every effort, you put in your way" “You shall see victory” "With you, the earth isn't lonely anymore" “The world rejoices!” “Go ahead in your way bravely…” "…and rise like a tidal wave" “Time flies when your timer ticks” “Your eyes are filled with ablaze” “You give out a heavenly touch!” “No one can ever reach out to you” “There’s no limit to such spirit” “Bonding is in control!” Hey!

Your gaze is audacious” “Life could be awful or fortunate!” "With every effort, you put in your way" “You shall see victory” Brother! Brother! Come this way. [Talking In Malayalam] [Talking In Malayalam] [Talking In Malayalam] Accha! Talk! Accha? Hello! How are you? She is amazing. She'd be part of our family someday. Little more. She’d part of our family. That is enough! No, she is part of our family. What’s that? Why is he saying the same thing? [Talking In Malayalam] Hold this. Hello! Are you from Kerala? My father is from Kerala and my mother is from Andhra Pradesh. Do you have an issue? Hey! Who are they? Friends! School friends, college friends… Everyone would be there. Oh! We can check their photos and they can check ours. We can chat and talk. Don’t you such friends? They must have got married after college. They may not remember me. We can find them on Facebook. Goms! Let’s create a page for you. And, let’s find your friends. Rani! Amrutha Kumari! Amrutha… Kumari. Kumari. Rani Amrutha… “You’ve got a good position” “You have your own ways” “The world goes dull without you” “There’s joy and excitement everywhere” “When accompanied with you!” “Beauty revolves around you” “Your smiles blossom like florets” “You take up the burden of others” “The true meaning of affection is you” “You’ve been like a backbone” “You stride off without hurdles” [CLAMOR] “Hey, girl!

Your gaze is audacious” “Life could be awful or fortunate!” Hey! Please keep quiet…all of you! Talk now. She's staying at home. When someone questions about wife… He says she just stays home. Aren’t we doing anything? We buy vegetables and cook. We clean the house, do the dishes, and wash clothes. Clothes of husband and kids! We feed our kids. We drop them at school and pick up in the evening. We fill the water. Aren’t we doing all that work? Are we getting paid for it? Or do we at least get off on Sunday? You demand us to cook Chicken or Mutton. Why do you say that they’re simply staying home? You go out whenever and wherever you want. We remain in a closed room or move around the apartment. You won’t even take me out for movies or beach at least once a year. Hey! What’s your problem now? Hey! I’ll ask your husband to take you out tomorrow. Now, leave. [GIGGLES] I don’t have such expectations. Just ask him not to come home boozed. Ask him to stop talking about me being idle. Oh! Hmm! Shall I get your divorce? Oh no! Don’t be silly. I wake up at 4 am. I go to the store, get milk, and boil it. I wash kids' clothes for 2 days and wash my husband's clothes for the other 2 days. I wash my clothes every day. I wanted to work but he denied. Whenever I question him, there’d be a fight. Simple! I got married during schooling. I somehow managed to finish my studies at college. I stayed home after marriage. I don’t work. Aren’t we doing anything? We buy vegetables and cook. We clean the house, do the dishes, and wash clothes. Clothes of husband and kids! We feed our kids. We drop them at school and pick up in the evening. We fill the water. Aren’t we doing all that work? The Great Indian Housewives! Indian Homemakers! Watch it on the Discovery Channel. Okay. Send it to the Channel. How’s the sound? Is it rocking? Not bad! You never appreciate it, do you? You’re awesome. Okay! This project is done. [SINGING] Let’s do the next project. Call Roop Singh and confirm that Chhattisgarh project. Is that all? Shall I schedule the Chhattisgarh project? Yeah, that’s it. A documentary on tribal women of Chhattisgarh! Super, Prabha. Look, sir. Is 2000 rupees a big amount for prices these days? No, madam! 2000 is high. Lessen it a bit, madam. Sir! Kids who study sixth and seventh grade pay 1000 rupees. Hey, Kamala! Yes, teacher. What’s the fee that you are paying? I don’t know, teacher. My mother pays the fee. She said it is 1500 rupees. Goms! Everyone believes that kids improve their studies here. She’s talking to someone. Give it a thought, sir. This is for your daughter’s education, right? Goms! Confirm it for 1700 rupees. Goms! Come with me. Just come. Come without fail. You’d be served with snacks and sweets too. Madam! I cannot pay that much. Let’s go! – 1500 is final! Okay? You should pay the fees on time. Come, Goms! Listen to me once. You cannot drag me out whenever you want, Prabha. Listen! I found Rani. Find Raja then. Hey! I found Rani Amrutha Kumari. Is it true? Oh my! She hasn’t changed. She’s just the same. Smokey eyes just like you! She’s a great dancer. Her dancing is amazing. I’m surprised. Shall we ask her number? Can we get it? Shall we ask her number? Ask her. In the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit… Amen! [KIDS CHATTER] Is it okay to come late? Is it okay to come late? Don’t give me excuses. Don’t give me excuses. – This is for one last time, madam. Go. Hey, Rani! Subbu has been crying. Gomu wants you there! What happened? Come… It seems her marriage for fixed. They’re rich. The groom lives in Hyderabad. So, what’s the problem? What's wrong with getting married? She got lucky but not us. We’re caught up here. Hey, children! What are you murmuring? Sr. There’s a rat in my room. Shall I go and see, Sr.? Go. Hey! What are you doing? Did you get here? Rani! Look at there. She doesn’t stop crying. She wants to commit suicide. Hey! Get down. Did you bring peanuts? Yeah, right! An essential! What’s the issue? Is this a joke for you? I will indeed commit suicide. [Talking In Tamil] [Talking In Malayalam] Shut up and get down. No! Hey! Who’s that? You’d study well. Am I supposed to have kids? Look at this. My dad wrote a letter to me. He’s a big shot in Annavaram. They are ready to accept 10000 rupees as dowry. That’s why my parents want me to get married. How come we don't know any tamilians here? I don’t know. How would I know? Lakshmi Traders, Annavaram…is the address. Lakshmi Traders? They supply rice to our hostel. They’re rich indeed. Hey! Shut up. Let me ask you one last time. Will you marry or not? I will not marry… Hey, Gomu! Do you have their contact? Hey! Open it slowly. Sr. is here. What should we do now? What is she doing? She is dyeing her hair. What? Dye? [DOGS BARKING] You shouldn’t be here. Get inside everyone. Get in. Alphonse! I’ll be there, madam. Have you let out all the dogs? Okay, madam. I did it. Did you lock the first floor? – Yeah! Did you lock the storeroom? – I locked that, madam. Ground floor? I found it. Did you find it? Show me. This is their store contact. Check if their home contact is available. Yes. Both contacts are here. Very good! Give it to me. [DIALLING] They don’t pick it up. Give me the other contact. We might get caught. Will you get married then? No way! Then, wait. Hello. Hello. Am I speaking Lakshmi Traders' owner? Yes. Who is it calling at this hour? This is Subbalakshmi speaking. Your future daughter-in-law. Oh! How are you doing? You are kind-hearted. No. Is it good to hold back whole expressing gratitude? Okay! Where are you calling from? Is that important to know? Thanking you is much more important. What’s this, dear? Why thank me? Why shouldn’t I? It is so great of you to accept someone who’s ill. What? Who’s ill? Weren’t you informed? No! – Hey… I have white patches behind my ear. Oh no… My feet are swollen. Oh my! Notwithstanding this, I am accepted in your house. – Hey! I feel blessed, father-in-law. Stop it. I am blessed. I called you at this hour without caring about my night blindness. Do you know why, father-in-law? Do you know why? Why because I am blessed. I am blessed. – Listen, dear. What did the doctor say? Hello? How’s it? Mother raised a goat. She raised a hen. But, she hasn’t raised a dog. She raised Rani. How’s it? Did all of you get caught? Of course! What happened to the wedding? Subbu's marriage got canceled and Rani got hitched. Goms! I want to meet Subbu. Yeah, right. Shall we find her now? Oh! I have no idea where Subbu is. She must be having grandchildren too. Let’s find out. [PHONE RINGING] Give me a minute. Hello. Tell me, bro. Is it ready? No…Let us not delay. We shall do it tomorrow I’ll leave right now. Goms, I am leaving for Tamilnadu. Oh no! What’s with this sudden travel? Why don’t you answer me?

It’s a new place for the girl. What did you say to the boy? Peramalur! Where did you hide till now? That’s none of your business, bro. Where is your registrar? Greetings, sir. Please come, sir. There he is. Sir. Nothing much. I have urgent work to do. I’ll call you later. Okay. Move a little. Hey, Damodhar! – Yes, sir. How long should I wait? What to do, sir? Today is an auspicious day There's a queue outside like the one you see at the FP shop. We have to conduct at least 2 weddings a month, isn’t it? That’s how I can make some money. Do you know how risky this is? I know. They won’t be staying here past noon. You’ll never reform, right? When is your wedding? Will yours be the same? A car wedding? It’s a huge risk, sir. Last month at the registrar’s office, 10 men came in, madam. They stabbed both and took them along. You are not taking it seriously. You heard him, right? Beware! Registrar sir! Yes, madam. What are the cops doing in your town? Instead of doing their duty, are they asking you to be alert? Are you done, Damodhar? Sorry, sir. What are you gazing at? Go… Go...! Get lost.

You must attend my son’s wedding. My daughter-in-law is pregnant? Your daughter-in-law? Yes. You’d be a grandma soon, is it? What about you? That won’t happen any sooner. Okay.

We might get one. What is it, sis? Nothing. [PHONE RINGING] Tell me, Goms. Prabha! You introduced Facebook to me and all my works remain unfinished. Okay, Goms I want to say something important! – I want to say something important. Okay. You go first. What I wanted to say is… Do you want me to go first? I spoke with Rani Amrutha Kumari today.

I swear I won’t eat. I’ll thrash you! You have to eat that. You got used to eating junk food. So, you don't like homemade food. How can she deny it? My son loves snake gourd curry. She simply refuses. Have something in the canteen if you don’t like my food. Okay? Your digestive system would get worse if you eat there. I'll cook your favorite food after you reach home. I made this. Have it with curd rice. Wash your lunch box. Otherwise, it might stink. Hey, Goms! Who is this? What? I took it out yesterday. How is it? You’re looking so cute, Goms. That’s Rani Amrutha Kumari. She is in Agra. I told you, right? She is Subbalakshmi. I have no clue where she is. Let’s find her, Goms! I feel sad ever since my son left home. I just cannot forget him. I don’t know where all my friends are. School and then hostel! My father got me to stay in a hostel. He visited me just once in a year. There wasn’t any problem. He would send 150 rupees every time. He's kind of strict with rules. My mother felt ashamed to accept me as her daughter. That’s because I was born a girl. But, my younger brother stayed with her. For me, living in a hostel was more like a home. I was happy. Are you such good friends? Best friends! There’s Rajnikanth in the movie. There is Kamal Hassan too. Yeah! Hey! Stand in the queue. No way! Are you planning to escape if I get caught by chance? I denied coming on a released day. But, you did not listen to me. Look how crowded it is. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey! This movie is going to be awesome. It is an adult movie. What’s so great about it? Will there be off-limit scenes? Then, I join you in the queue. Hey. Hey! Look there. He is smiling at you. Not bad! He is good looking. Shall I scare him off? No need! He dressed up well and looks decent. I’ll slap you! Happy Diwali. I have 3 tickets with me. My friends ditched me suddenly. Do you want to buy it? How did have exactly 3 tickets? Hush! How much is it? Counter rate! Take it. I think you are pretty. Happy Diwali! Hey! Curly hair! Hey! Who’s in the theatre? Sisters came here. How dare you sell tickets to girls! Who is the manager? Call the manager. Hey! Come out. We’re caught! Hey, Rani, Subbu! Both of you come out. Get up. Hey, Gomu! Let her stay there You both come out. Come fast. Madam, Gomatha? You come. She’ll join you. Madam! Let me come. – Stay there. You’ll have to face it. Stay there until noon. Your father will come. Please, madam… Hey! Open the door, madam. – Gomatha! Gomatha won’t come. You go. She’ll stay there. – I am scared. These kids never listen to me. Hey! Where are you going? Rani! We’re running a reputed institution. What if something happens to them when they step out without taking permission? Who will take care? We’re concerned about them. They are wearing jewels in the hostel. Above all, they are jumping out of the campus. And this is not the first time they're doing such a nuisance. Sorry, madam. How dare they step out at night! These girls aren’t reticent. Rani! – They called up last night and asked me to come. I said I’ll handle it in the morning but I heard her screaming on phone. Rani! Don’t leave me and go. Don’t leave me and go. It is scary here. Rani! Rani! Subbu! They can’t stay here even for a minute. I’ll talk to their parents. [BANGING] These girls should never be seen around the campus. No…No! Rani! Subbu...Rani! Gomu! Gomu! Oh no… After that incident, I haven’t seen them. For such a petty issue? Our school was very strict. We did a mistake. What happened next? Didn’t you even talk to each other after that? I didn’t know their addresses. Hey! I will kill you. I pity your parents. Prabha! I’ll be right back. We remain in a closed room or move around the apartment. You won’t even take me out for movies or beach at least once a year. [MUSIC] Hello. Did anyone get drenched in the rain? Are you getting wet without clothes on? Tie this towel. Wait! I’ll secure it. Wait… [KIDS PLAYING] This one is too naughty. Hey, kids! Take a break from tuition for 2 weeks. Wait...wait… Hey! Haven’t I told you I cannot come to Chhattisgarh with you? We aren’t going to Chhattisgarh. We are going to Agra! [CHORUS] “Come on, Gandhari! Let there be some bliss” “This joyful heart is filled with excitement” “You spread a beautiful emotion” "This world receives affection from you" “The house is filled with delight and folks” “The place is illuminated with your smiles” “You’ve gotten that comfort and lessened the burden” “This merriment you brought up feels heavenly” “You’ve gotten that comfort and lessened the burden” “This merriment you brought up feels heavenly” “You spread a beautiful emotion” "This world receives affection from you" “When you step out like that” “A new verve is perceived ahead” “Although the days pass by, memories are never elapsed” “When there’s love, this beautiful life goes on and on experiencing it” "There would happiness around all the time by spreading the love" “With hurdles coming up, and handling obligations” “There’s nothing that can stop when you receive it with a smile” “You’ve gotten that comfort and lessened the burden” “This merriment you brought up feels heavenly” “You’ve gotten that comfort and lessened the burden” “This merriment you brought up feels heavenly” “You’ve gotten that comfort and lessened the burden” “This merriment you brought up feels heavenly” “You’ve gotten that comfort and lessened the burden” “This merriment you brought up feels heavenly” Hey! Go away! Go away. No one should stay here. Go away. Has someone lost it? What’s all this? You spend money inadequately. Kemuka has chosen his daughter-in-law as his candidate. Huh? Didn’t get it? Kemuka has chosen his daughter-in-law as his candidate for the upcoming Panchayat elections. Who told you? Why would anyone tell me? I am 35 years old. I am the father of three daughters. I have to manage everything with just two shoe factories. I need Party support to run that factory. I need the factory to make extra income. Who told you all this? I have my spies there. We get to know everything they do. Daddy! I am not like you. To get back my position in this Party, I’ll go to any extent. Oh, really? What will you do? The person who was your candidate back then has got deciding authority. He decided that his daughter-in-law should stand the elections. You should make your daughter-in-law stand for election. Silly fellow! She delivered a baby a few days back. That’s just not my point. Women should be kept where they belong! It would be trouble if they were given that freedom. Just good for making babies! Once they step out, they’d make us follow their footsteps. Have you lost it? You don’t have to say it. He declared it a Ladies' ward! The question is who will win? Yours or Kemukas? That’s just a formality. He’ll take back the decision with one phone call. Moreover, your wife delivered a baby and just got home. Who else will you choose? Hmm! Mom is calling you. Come on, Varshini! Hit 4 this time! Okay, sis. Oh no! Hey! – Throw the ball properly. Hit properly. Hey! Don’t talk about hitting. You’ll get hit if you do not play well. Get it? Why are doing such tasks? I’ll do it. Just go. Stay quiet. Shouldn’t I do? You don’t know anything. Give it to me. You are rich, right? Why don’t you hire a maid? Come on, Varshini! Come on! Hit a 4 this time. Yay! I hit… What’s this? Don’t get smacked by me. Prabha! Stop that mischief and go out. Okay… Who am I then? What? You said about hiring another maid, right? Who am I then? Hey! Isn’t your husband treating you well? My maid is here. Isn’t your husband treating you well? Treating me well? Buying clothes! Providing food! Introducing you as his wife to others? Hey! Tell me the truth. Does he hurt you physically? Get lost! Hey, you! Listen to me. Tell me the truth. The way you say it sounds like he’s a bastard. I knew the very first time I saw him. He had that innocent face and a sharp nose. He’s alone. But, he came as if his legion is with him. Your husband looks like a villain in the movie. Stop it now. Don’t be mad at me for talking about your husband. Forget about that. Tell me what your problem is. There isn’t much issue, Gomu. We want to be treated like a heroine. – Yes. But, all I get to do is a sidekick role. Someone else has grabbed my role Hey. Hey! Aunty! The ball came that way. Give it, please. Listen, Prabha! I’ll smack you if I come there. Go outside and play. Throw the ball. She’s creating a fuss along with children. Why do you always hit the call into the kitchen, Varshini? We have to throw the ball. Hmm. Throw fast. What are you thinking about? She’s telling a joke. Can I leave? Okay! Come at 6 am tomorrow. – Okay… Gomu! I am the senior maid here. My home, food, and some affection are my wages. Girls! Am I disturbing you? You obviously disturbed us. Why question is about it? Goms! You’re abandoning me after reuniting with your friend. Don’t pinch me. – Okay…Let’s go. There’s a lot to discuss. Where? Tell me where you’re taking me. Have you met anyone studying PUC? I have no idea. Somehow I feel like meeting Subbu. She was such a crybaby. – No idea how she’s doing! She used to weep all the time. Yeah. You are right. By the way, she was supposed to get married while in college, right? Where is she now? I don’t know where she is. I have been searching for her. We shall find her someday. She was concerned about studies. She didn’t want marriage, right? I wonder how she’s doing right now. Her father wanted to get her married early. She must have become a grandma now. I must call her ‘Subbu’ as soon as I see her. That’s it. [Talkin In Tamil] Super, madam… You are more fluent in Telugu than Tamil, madam. You may leave. Yes. I will come. Madam! What about my payment? I’ll give it. You may go now. Hey! I’ll be there, mother-in-law. I’ll collect payment tomorrow evening, madam. [GROANING] Subbu! Where did you disappear? Whom are you talking to? I am simply lying here. I haven’t taken my pills yet. What are you doing? Oh my… What are you doing? I am bedridden. Am I trouble for you? You used to come and stand before me with respect. Now, you won’t even come to me when I call. It is 8 pm now. Is my son back home? Why would simply leave without answering me? They never answer me. I don’t understand anything. I am bedridden and I know nothing about what others are doing. I can’t even guess what runs in their mind. No one respects me. They stopped answering me. Hey! Did he come? Isn’t he home yet? It’s late. It is past 8. Why wouldn’t you answer me? Oh no! You have a son, don’t you? You’d be in my shoes one day and you would understand how I feel. Are you feeling bad to do service for me? I worked hard and fostered my only son. Why are you having trouble looking after me? [SOBBING] “This is my first love letter” “I feel shy to say it hence I wrote it” “I cannot express when I in front of you” “My language isn’t good enough to express” Oh no! “My language isn’t good enough to express” Have you come, my child? “This is my first love letter” “I feel shy to say it hence I wrote it” Hey! Your wife would let me die. My son! What’s this fate of mine? Your wife would kill me. [VOCALS] Will you come for dinner? I’ve had my dinner already, dear. [SINGING ‘SITARA’ MOVIE SONG] [PHONE BUZZING] [SINGING ‘JABILLI KOSAM’ SONG] What do you want? Forgive me, Subbu. For all the iniquities men did against women all these years, I sincerely apologize on behalf of all, Subbu! Forgive me, Subbu. There’s no chance of forgiveness. Do you want to get slapped? I said, there’s no chance of forgiveness. Do you want to get slapped? Hit me, Subbu. Hit me hard, Subbu. You torture me, grandpa. You want them to be up there now and want them down at noon. You know nothing, kiddo! This is the Bonsai tree. Did you see how I grew such a big tree in a small pot? Trees should be grown outside, not at home. Good morning, Ra. Good morning Ra, I have something important to say. You, Goms, and I...will be going on a trip for 3 days. 3 days! Just 3 days! Ra! It is my responsibility. I’ll convince uncle. Ra! Just come. Uncle won’t agree, Prabha. It is a deceptive dungeon. You won’t understand even if I explain. Ra! You need a break. Come on. You are indeed Gomu’s daughter-in-law. Ra…Ra! Any help? What? Any help? Can you get me a bike? “May I always be protected…” “I honor the jubilant saint…” “I honor the jubilant saint…” “O’ red lobed Lord! May I always be protected” “O’ Lord of Sindh and sire of Shewan” “Your shrine is always lighted with four lamps” “Lord! Here I come to light the fifth one” This is the Taj Mahal! Shahjahan built it for Mumtaz. 42 acres, 1000 elephants, 30 types assorted stones… 20,000 people built this and 32 crores were spent on it. Besides, 3 – 4 lakhs of tourists visit this place every year? Do you know? Wikipedia says it all. Tell me something new. Shall I tell you? But, you shouldn’t get angry? It is okay. Tell me. Mumtaz had 14 kids and died in her 30s. It is her tomb. Her husband built it with grief. Am I right? Hello. Hey, Ameena! Prabha, can we go for the shoot as planned? No! Aunt and I are planning a trip with her friends. Do one thing. Implement the plan starting from November 1 st . Okay. What happened to those lovebirds? They are happily settled. Roop Singh Goud hired both of them. Hey! Let’s go. Okay! Talk to you later. I'll see you on the 30 th ! Okay? I’m worried about my tuition kids. Half-yearly exams are approaching. Come, Goms!

We aren’t going anywhere. Kids would wait for me. Hush! – Come with me. Hey! Hey! – Oh no! Ra! Will you take uncle's permission or should I? Impossible, Prabha! It is way more difficult now. What now? Yeah, right! I’ll be standing for elections… [CHEERING] Ward councilor? Great triumph! Yeah! They’re just using me to develop their business. Whatever it is, being elected as a ward councilor is a great accomplishment. I would be simply signing that too by staying home. Ward councilor my foot! See that! What are you going to do? Daily routine! Cleaning the house, and cooking! Those are my duties as Ward councilor! Most lady councilors in India would sign as per their husbands’ commands. They’d treasure the money they receive. Forget it! When is the election? Why? 15 th of next month! Then, let’s leave tomorrow We’ll be back in 3 days. Keep quiet and go to bed. She is tired. Go! Go and get some rest. O’ Lord! Both of you!! What? Goms! I feel like coming but it doesn’t work that way. Hush! She’s got no other work. There’s a lot of work tomorrow. Go and sleep.

Sleep… Sleep, dear. Hey! Give it to me. Get me more. Come fast. It is good. He caught Gomu. Come soon Tell me. It is a game for girls? Shall I complain to Mother? Hey! You come. Look how he yells.

Hey… [CHEERING] Don’t do that. Eat something, dear. You haven't eaten anything from the morning. Shut up! You deal with it. Chewing betel leaf won’t solve anything. Eliminate Kondandarama or his wife before the election Hey! Stop! [TV PLAYING] [HUMMING] I am going out of town for a week. You have to take care of your mother. You go, Subbu… I will take care of my mother Why should you look after her? You go, Subbu. But, you’ll be back, right? Limit your alcohol intake. Your mother might need you anytime. Eat homemade food. I have said everything to our maid Manju. She will make things ready for your mother. You go, Subbu… I shall take care of my mother. Why should you look after her? These pills should be given thrice a day before food. This pill should be given after lunch. I have noted down everything. Take care. Yeah! I have started. The train is at 10:30! Nizamuddin Express! I’d be in Agra tomorrow by midnight Hope you won’t ditch me. Okay... Subbu? You’ll be back, right? Here...move close to the plants. Come inside. Smile… Just smile a little. Wonderful! Take okay! Where are you going? Archana! Where did she disappear? Will you come here? Quick! Your father would want it hot. Aunty is here. Don’t cry, dear. [CRYING] Hey! Good timing! Shall I picture? Get away. You’d make series out of it if given a chance. Print it out. Go… Let’s go… You go ahead. May God be with you! Hey! Go to bed. What about the food? I’ll take care of it. Karthik! Shall I make some fryums? Get lost. Has she gone inside? I think I underestimated them. She gives a warning when deprived of a contesting seat. How do you know this? I am your father! Okay, listen. You should always carry weapons. Don’t go out alone. Take someone with you. That mutt doesn’t have mercy on anyone. Ask everyone to beware. [GAGGING] [PRAYER] [INDISTINCT NOISES] Dad! Mom is missing. Dad! Mom is missing. Dad. She’d be working somewhere around. Check properly. No, dad. Brother! Mom is missing. Hey, Kala! Get my pants ready. Mother. Daddy! He has kidnapped her. Hey! Start the car. Daddy! Hey! Check properly. He kidnapped her, dad. He has kidnapped my mother. Hey! Where have you been? Where are you, man? Hey! Don’t be hasty. Hey! Hey! Stop overacting. Where did the grandma go? Rani! [SCREAMS] Oh no! Hey, Rani… Open your eyes. Hey, Rani! Can you hear me? This is Subbu! Subbu? Who is this? Hey! I am Gomu. Hey, Gomu! What have you done to yourself? I applied make-up. She got me ready. I did it…I am a beautician. Okay. But, where are you taking me? Hush! You cannot give any more excuses. It works only if we grab 3 days of your routine life. – Yes. Girls! No one should ask any questions about our plans or about returning. 3 days! Just 3 days! We shall live for ourselves. Okay? Where are we going? Hey, Prabha! Tell me where you are leading us. I am also a part of this world. Come. Hey! [ALL]: Hey! “Unwavering, unswerving, let’s spree like a breeze” “Let’s go, let’s start flapping and head high up the sky” “When anyone questions about your acts being a woman” “Go along with your journey without caring to answer” “The world is unique…made just for you!” “You’ve got an even share” Hey, Brits! Do you go easy on a woman? I am the savior of good ones. I am a beast for evil ones. I can slit your neck with this weapon and control your awful acts. Yay! Awesome! Why is it so dirty? Don’t they know how to keep it clean? And they call it the Yamuna! Shut up! You shouldn’t say that. Why were rivers named after women… as Ganga, Yamuna, Kaveri? Rivers are divine just like women. Goms! Stop cooking up stories. No God or religion can take care of rivers. Tell her that! No woman has been respected either. Hey! It isn’t just our housemate. There are two more people. They packed clothes, belongings, and left. I somehow feel that they weren’t kidnapped. Daddy! Hey! Listen to me. Don’t I know what happens during election time? We might lose our reputation. Do one thing. “God hasn’t created everything for man” “Let’s pace off and rule the world” “Let’s pace off and rule the world” What about your parents? Dad is into the rubber business in Kerala. My mom is a writer. She has written more than 25 Telugu books you know. Oh! My dad started drinking after my mom’s demise. Theirs is love marriage. He missed her a lot. But, I told him clearly that I wouldn’t stay with him if he boozes. Now, he is okay. Shall we see who can throw it the farthest? Let’s go for it. – Yes. See that? I win. See? That’s mine. “You’ve got no free time at least one day” “But, you never earn anything” “There are many responsibilities to handle” “You never get to take off” “This is your chance” “You’ve got your time” “Let’s pace off and rule the world” “Let’s pace off and rule the world” “Happiness swirls within…reminding childhood memories” “When there’s a friend who needs your companionship,” Move! “You won’t need anything more than that” What are you trying to do? “It brings out colors that shine like aspirations” I want to sit in the front. That wasn’t me. They did it. “Let’s pace off and rule the world” “Let’s pace off and rule the world” “Unwavering, unswerving, let’s spree like a breeze” “Let’s go, let’s start flapping and head high up the sky” “When anyone questions about your acts being a woman” “Go along with your journey without caring to answer” “The world is unique…made just for you!” “You’ve got an even share” “God hasn’t created everything for man” It has been a day already. I sent accomplices to Delhi, Madras, and Sikandra. But, there is no response. What shall we do now? Hey! Can’t you put enough salt in the food? There’s no salt in it. Let us wait until tomorrow morning. Don’t’ dump it. Sprinkle a little. Little by little! Hey! Your wife is the one who is missing. But, you are happily enjoying the food. Hey! Go away. Hey! Stop it. Stop it I say. Daddy! Why are you scolding Varshini? I saw it. Archana was the one who helped Grandma with packing. Ask her. Brother! Don’t think about it. No. I said no. No, brother. Daddy! Ask him not to thrash. Hey! What’s going on? Where did she go? We should've planned this after the elections. This girl doesn’t listen to me. Girls! There’s a solid reason why I am taking you somewhere now. This is the right time for the trip. Just 2 more days! After that, you can go wherever you want. Okay? My son would be searching for me. No idea if my husband ate or not. Ra! I want to clear something. Don’t you think this is extreme? Won’t they eat unless you feed them? Won’t they sleep unless you tuck them in? That’s right, Prabha! A woman has that responsibility. Hey, Subbu! This is too much. All of you unnecessarily worry. You’ll keep running behind them because of these emotions. Otherwise, you must be scared that they’d leave you. Hey! Look how’s she talks. Hey, Prabha! Don’t be rude to her. What else, Ra? Okay, tell me. Do you love your husband or is it fear? Kind of both you know! Goms! What about you? Hey! I am scared of her husband. I am sorry, buddy. She is asking about your husband. – Your husband it is. My husband? He’s no more, right? Hey! Tell me how you felt when he was alive. I don’t know. Goms behave that way now. I’ll ask her privately. Yeah! Subbu! What about you? Neither! Hey! Don’t lie. You are scared of your husband, aren’t you? – Yes! As if she takes part in a race. Do you know what pace she’s got? Is it true? She almost won the running competition at school. But, she is the second runner up. Do you know who the winner is? It is her... Oh! I am a runner up. Wow! Is it true? She's the second runner up. Hey! I had an ankle twist that day. Otherwise… What otherwise? Okay! Are you ready to compete with me now? Let's race off! – No! Hey! We’re doing well. Leave it. Prabha! Stop the car. Let’s end it here. Are you joking? Hey, Rani! Are you scared? Win over me now and I shall accept your victory. Oh no! Okay. I am not afraid. Prabha! Stop the car. Okay! Alright! Hey, Prabha! You are the one to be blamed. They were doing okay. But, you provoked them. On your marks! Get set! [WHISTLES] Hey! Come on. Run, Goms! Rani! Hey! Be careful. Oh my! Gosh! What happened? Rani? – Did you get hurt? Ouch! Careful! Hey! What happened? Get up… Oh no… Did your ankle twist? I told you not to race. But, you did not listen to me. Are there weapons in the vehicle? Hey! Are there weapons in the vehicle? Yes, why? Stop! What is it? What are you looking at? Talk to me. Where are you coming from? We’re from Agra. Do you know whom you are talking to? Shall I call the minister? Open the bag. Check it properly. We belong to Uttar Pradesh This isn’t U.P. It is Chhattisgarh. Sir, we got the stuff. What is this? Did you keep it to cut vegetables or what? I have come in search of my mother. Hey! Don’t talk too much. Listen to me once, sir. – Come Your gentle foot goes next. Take a step. That’s it. Go for it. Take the next step now. Go for it. That’s it…go for it. Next… Go for it. The doctor would've worsened your leg instead of treating your sprain. This has happened because of you. Come here… Hey! Why challenge me with race? Come on. Slowly! That’s enough. Let us go. Come. Hey! She was the one who got you into this position. Why are you blaming me? Come… Hold on. – Wait… That cow (Anamma) is delivering her calf The caregiver isn't here. Let’s go and check. Is Sr. here? Move… What happened? What happened to you? Hey! Gomatha, hold it. I am afraid. I can’t hold it. Nothing will happen… Hey, Rani! Hold her tail. God! Help me. So sad! She's suffering a lot. Do you have a rope? Hey! Be careful. Hey! Move. Move aside. Let there be some air. Hey, Subbu! You don’t know anything. Why are you meddling? Take care. Take care of it. Hey, Rani! Hold her on the other side. Nothing will happen, dear. Hold on a little. Nothing will happen. I'll go bring somebody. Hey, Subbu! Be careful. It came… Hey, Komali! What happened? Nothing is bad. It is almost done. Hey, Komali! Anamma (cow) delivered a calf. How is it? Wow! Subbu, hi-five! Yeah…right! No chance! Your mother-in-law is fearless. She’s trying to provoke. Listen. You were born and brought up in a village. That is why you could easily do the delivery. How would I know? We won’t be able to do such things unless we have past experiences. Subbu, do you deliver babies too? I haven't witnessed delivering my baby. Listen! I know a few doctors. Why don’t you consult them? Hey! What is it? You talk without giving any thought to it. What’s your problem? Don’t get smacked by me. The vehicle is ready. Okay… Let’s go. Hey, wait. Wait. How did he fix the door so soon? Look at the design. A woman should bear it for 9 months. We should deliver a baby almost my breaking a few bones. And then, we should take care of babies for 2 years. Shucks! Hey, Goms! Will you be mad if I say I don’t want babies? I don’t know about that. It is up to you and your husband. Ask him to have the baby instead. Hey! Shall we make a call? No, Ra! Just 3 days! Please. Hey. Hey! Go and talk. Stop being fiddly. Come. Come. Goms! As soon as she talks, they would threaten her to come home. What? That’s going to happen. Hey! Her husband might complain to the cops. There are small kids there too. Do not fear and find out everything about what’s happening. Go! Ra! You have to stay with me no matter what. I know everything. Do you have 2 rupees? [PHONE RINGING] Hey! Hey! Yes, grandpa. Answer the phone. Hello. Are you fine, grandma? How are you, dear? I am fine. Won’t you come back home? Mom told me that you’ve escaped. Hey! Give it to me. Idiot! Where are you? Since when did you become brave? You’ve never stepped out far from the house. I’ll whack you up once I see you. Not just you! Your friends would be whacked too. How dare you leave the house? You’ve ruined our reputation. Hey, idiot! Can you hear me or not? I’ll kill you. Where the hell are you? Why don’t you speak? Hello? Hello! Ra! No sentiment! No emotion! Just 3 days of your life! Live for yourself. Just for you! Take this and put it back. You guys are lucky. I don’t even know if I would ever meet my friends after these many years. No idea. Ra! Loosen yourself. Come on. Most of the housewives are in the same situation. I realized it while making a documentary film. Each one of them had so many desires, they had good dreams, and anger adds up to it. You were right. Marriage is a deceptive dungeon for women. We have to kick hard. Either the door should open or the walls should break with our kick. What? Okay! When you feel stressed…you should dismiss negative energy. Go for it. Here? Yes, right here. I’ll do it with you. Come. Hey, Prabha! Come fast. What are you doing there? You keep on nagging about sending you to a hostel. Why did I do so? I get transferred every 2 years. Bangalore, Nagpur, Delhi! Can I keep traveling with her? Can I ask the Central Govt. why I got transferred? Listen! I am being nice because our child is a girl. Giving her a good education is a great thing. But, did she study properly? She ruined my name. All those nuns are worried. Someone wanting to marry her is a big deal. Tell her to stop giving silly excuses. Ask her to marry that guy without any more arguments. He is a great guy. He plans to progress in life. Your life would be a blessing if you marry him. My life would be happy if I do that bank job, dad. How dare you answer me back! Stupid girl! – Hubby! Stop it. Will you ever talk like that again? – Stop it. Girls! Get down. Huh? Get down I said. Why? – Yeah, right. You have to say it right. What is it, Ra? – Come on. Tell me. Come on. Say it. What’s next? What’s next? Hey! Why is she sitting there? Hey! What is she planning to do? No…Do one thing. You have to write it 100 times. Rani! Why are you sitting in the driver’s seat? Do you know to drive? Hey, Prabha! Drive properly. What’s that pace? Who is driving? Take a look. Hey! Do you know to drive? Never touch the steering again. You don’t even know how to drive a car. We would sell it anyway. Won’t I ever buy a car again? Listen! I am going to sell this car and Gold gifted by your father. I’ll earn ten times more than this. I have that caliber. Trust me. Hey! Damn you! You’re doing great. Superb! Whoa! What’s this? She’s got a good pace while driving. Hey! Slow down. Check for obstacles. – Do you know how to drive already? Ouch! Hey! Why did you stop the car? Hey! Lord Ganesha, protect us! It is better to die before you than to be with them. I am coming to you! Hey! Hush! Goms, be quiet! They will move soon. They cross the road to drink water. Ra! Turn off the engine. How do you know that? Did they tell you? Hey! It is a Female elephant. She is pregnant. Do you want to deliver? Don’t shout. Stay quiet. She talks like a cop. Hey! The army vehicle is here. Ra! Start the car. Follow that vehicle and stop behind it. Go on…Start driving. They left. No! They might have guns. Did all those elephants leave? Can we proceed? Talk to him in Hindi. Are those elephants gone? Yes. Okay, come. Be careful. Drive carefully. Bye! Get down…fast! [HONKING] Chhattisgarh is my sanctuary, brother. It’s under my authority! I have asked them to search everywhere. They’ll find your wife by tomorrow. Don’t worry. Did you cross already? Come this way. That’s the reason. I am right here. Okay…come. Don’t stop anywhere. Keep on driving. Stop laughing and stay calm. Listen to me. Stop it. Hi. – Hi. Subbu! Come. This is Ameena and Prathap. – Hi. They work with me. They are Goms’ friends. Hi. What’s this place? This is the Achanakmar wildlife sanctuary. Oh! You can see many wild animals here. Tiger…Bull… Bison and many more that you can find! It seems there are wild animals that look like buffaloes. Hey! You’re already named after a wild ant. All ladies are making fun of me, right? Cool... Tonight and tomorrow night and it comes to an end. We shall our elders back home and then continue with our work. These are traditional weapons. You have time until tomorrow morning. You have to tell me whom you want to meet and why. Keep them in remand for 2 days and let them go. When does the training start tomorrow? – At 7! Sit over there. How can anyone eat this? This isn't a feast for you. Are you Telugu? Tamil. What are you doing here? We belong to Agra. My mother came here without informing us. I have come in search of her. Did your mother escape from the house at that age? Why? Why because she didn’t teach to eat food by getting rid of hair strands. Get up. Get up I say. Tell me the truth. What would you do if it is your house? Would you toss away the plate? It is quite common to find strands of hair in food when ladies cook it. What should you do? Remove it and eat. Did you do it? Sit down. Eat. What’s this? I feel dizzy. Do not talk. Listen to me and do what I say. Shall we play a game? Are you ready? Ready! This is called cooker exercise. Slowly. It might fall. Cooker? A cooker even here? This is a different cooker. Listen! You might have felt something you wanted to share but never got a chance to express. Okay. You should express it now. Okay It could be anger. Or it could agony. Think about someone whom you are angry with. Then, punch this. Go and punch it. Like this… Punch! Are you ready? Shall we? Okay! Okay! Who wants to do it first? She’ll go first. Stand still. Later, you can punch. Is it okay if I go first? Is it okay if I go first? That’s what I said. Subbu…All the best! See what she’ll do now. I have been observing. You come home every day. You weep for everything I ask you. When questioned, you act like an innocent person. It seems he should never be questioned. Tell me. Will you cry again? Will you whine soon after I open the door? Why didn’t you send me to work? If you have given me that freedom, I would have become a fifth-grade teacher at least. See! Worthless people are taking tuitions. Hey! I accepted when you did not let me work. Why did you ask me to abort the baby? The first one was a girl. Some astrologer asked you not to keep it. So, you forced me to abort the baby. Did I ever get pregnant again? Did I conceive? Did anyone yell at you? Everyone belittled me. You are not bothered. You will go to work every day. You’ll come home drunk. You drink to hide your weakness. What should I drink, man? I am imprisoned until death, is it? I should take care of you. I should take care of your mother. Hey, Rani! Where are you going? Hey! Punch it. Come on start. Aren’t you my best friend? Yes. Punch! Punch! Punch. Punch… Punch…Punch Oh no! Subbu! What happened to you, Subbu? Hey, Subbu! Come on. Be strong. I got it. Hey, Govinda! You don’t even consider me, right? You informally call me out whenever you want something. You command me without respect. Do you even take my name? I see it only on the family card and voters card. Do you even know my name? Rani Amrutha Kumari! Rani Amrutha Kumari it is! My name is Rani Amrutha Kumari. Rani...Rani! You punched your husband, right? Shall I punch him? Whack it! Punch! Subbalakshmi! Punch! Subbalakshmi! Hey, Prabha! Is it ‘Say a name and Punch game’? I don’t know. I understood. I’ll be there. My name is Gomatha. Goms! I will also punch Hold me. Give me support. Be careful, Goms! Gomatha is here. My mother named me to be strong. I won’t leave you. Gomatha… Watch it. Try to be gentle. Slowly! Here! Hold it tight. Set it right. Hold it tight. Wait. Okay, sir. Start driving. Hey! Where is my daughter-in-law? Go fast. Where is my daughter-in-law? Don’t worry, madam. We shall reach there soon. [SIREN] [DRILL COMMANDS] [COUNTING] Girls! Hurry up! Line up. Go...go fast. Just you! Go… Go. Hey! Take good care of your mother. Girls! Today is the last day, last night. We shouldn’t waste even a single second. Gomatha, Rani, Subbu, Prabha, Prathap, Ameena! Looks like you’ve enjoyed last night. It is hard to handle you. Thank you, brother. You’re this mischievous even now. I can imagine how you used to be while you’re all young. Do you want some water? Hey! What happened? Is this our funeral procession? I am unable to speak up. My throat is dry. – Take it. Drink some water. Okay We’re heading to Raipur now. We shall go to and Chitrakoot waterfalls from there. Our trip ends there. Choose a topic for unstoppable conversation until we reach there. Yeah, right! I should head back home by this time tomorrow and start campaigning. Why are worried about it now? Stay happy at present. Don't worry about the future. What do you want now? I want to hear a conversation that never ends. This is our topic! The three of you should tell me about your first memorable love story. Be it short or lengthy! Okay, Subbu? Ra! Okay? Goms should be fine too. Okay… You start telling your story. – What’s this? I will start the vehicle. “A guy with curly hair followed me” “He complimented my lovely gaze” “He’s gotten into my head in a jiffy” “I just couldn’t stop thinking of him” Hey! Is it the guy who gave us tickets at the theatre that day? “He got dressed up matching my teenage style” “He gave me a band to invoked me to tie” “He got into the house a snake charmer” “He tossed a ball and got my attention” “The entire village came to know about him” Ouch… Don’t hit me… “Days passed but the love wasn’t felt” “He’s gone for good without even saying his name” [VOCALS] Kodandha! “A guy with curly hair followed me” “He complimented my lovely gaze” “He’s gotten into my head in a jiffy” “I just couldn’t stop thinking of him” Is that murder or suicide? Okay! Hey, Subbu! Tell me your story now. That doesn’t work. Tell me. Just say it. You have to say it. “I passed on some time learning typewriting” “The keys were musical when typed with good timing” “That’s when I felt love at once” “My heart danced along to the music” “My master never leaves a chance” “His moves are mischievous” “Love is blind and not in control” “It makes me overwhelming without holding back” “A S D F G F G F! Love is blind and not in control” “A S D F G F G F! It makes me overwhelming without holding back” “Like an auction in Guntur, the entire family surrounded” “On top of it, master showered lots of love” “She’s not seen around before the dawn break” “She’s here to stay with him” [BANGING] Whom do you want? Is the master home? Dear! “A S D F G F G F! Love is blind and not in control” “Oh my…O’ God…” “Oh my…O’ God…” How can you cheat that little girl? I won’t spare you, you idiot Bloody idiot! Okay! Next is… Gomatha! Hey! I will whack you up. – You have to say. Why did you end up with me? Nothing doing! – Say it I will not say anything. – Say! “Lovely guy! Handsome guy!” “He is good-looking while holding a corn cob” “He wrote a poem and recited it to me” “He tickled me to give a smile” “Biryani isn’t favorite any more” “Nothing comes up in mind” “The love hidden in me isn’t known” Hey… “I treasured it to my heart but he showed up” “Lovely guy! Handsome guy!” "Hey! Onion fritters! With flatbreads" “He showed his love by sharing the curry” “He played some tricks and made me smile” “He got closer with his overwhelmed love” Okay! What happened next? Then? Hey! Hey! What happened? Take this. I thought of finding a girl for you in the city. I planned to get you married to a girl from our caste. How dare you fall in love! I will thrash you! Be careful! Bloody scoundrel! Ouch! My mother is not accepting our love, Gomu. Forgive me, Gomu. “He crossed his limits” “Never trust a mustache” “Never escalate your desires” “Never believe in your gaze if you think its love” No chance, Goms! My love story ended up that way. Okay! Whom did you marry? This is what happened next. Hey! Where are you going, Subbu? [HONKING] What happened, Subbu? What happened? Breathlessness! For who? Your husband? Don’t be silly! It is my mother-in-law. Oh no! Oh my! Is it serious? Why are you trying to rob? What’s wrong? Isn’t she our mother? Stop it, Balaji. Mom asked us to get it secretly. Did you see it? I did not see it. Shall we take a sneak peek? Take your hands off. Someone is calling. Oh no! It is my brother. Brother? Talk to him. I am scared Why be scared? Give it to me. I'll talk to him. Hello! Tell me. This is Balaji speaking. Yes. We are heading to Chitrakoot Falls. Yes! We’re going to meet our mother. What? What will you do? Come Do you think I am scared? Hey! – Come Give it to me. Brother! Just one day. I’ll stay with mom and get back. Please, brother. Brother! You won’t spoil the plan, will you? Hello Hello? You remain a chatterbox wherever we go. Try to stay quiet. Hey! When did you talk to them for the last time? You mean Shankar and Kousalya? Yesterday! Why? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hello? Where are you? Stay safe. We’ll meet you. Okay. Give me some water. Hey! He’s not here. Just ignore that and eat. Is it a joke? We didn’t come here alone. We’ve brought all these people. Hey! What’s happening here? You are murmuring and she’s observing everyone. What’s happening here? What’s the issue? Shall we tell them what the issue is? Shut up and eat. Keep quiet! When is the right time to say then? Tell me. I am about to tell you something that no one knows. What is that? – What happened? We went to film a documentary on Vizag one day. The theatre was completely crowded. It was around 4. Am I right? Maybe! Silence! Okay, Madhu! Start. Will you opt to love marriage or arranged marriage? Shall I talk? – Yes. Go ahead. Marrying a random stranger is out of the box now. This generation kids pursue their education. They have exposure to understand things. How we marry a stranger? Look there. What? Is it shooting? How can you expect us to marry a stranger? How can we live happily with him? If you ask me to choose between love and arranged marriage, I choose love marriage. 98 of 100 girls… Hey! [COMMOTION] Oh no! Who are you? Oh no! Hey! Who are you? – Hey! Hey! – Oh no no! Stop it! [BIKE REVVING] Hey! Catch him. Oh no! Hey! Oh no no! Check what happened. Prankster! Did you lie all this while about your wound? Did the boy live or not? That was a tiny wound. Lucky! Their love story would have ended if it wasn’t for Prabha! Oh no! Awesome! What happened to that couple? She got them married next week. They’re not in the same city anymore. Hey! Get up! Let’s leave. Nothing is wrong, Goms! No problem I said! I’ll whack you! Who will face my son? Stop laughing. I won’t listen to you. You should listen to me. Hey, Goms! – Get up now. Take this. You don’t make support at least. Sister! What does she mean? You’re there. But, you cannot do anything alone. Come. Hey! Listen to me. My job is to carry info. I get paid for that. Money is not an issue. Tell me who they are. Damn! One minute… Hey, Prabha! You are trouble. Why do you get involved in such things? No, darling! Liberation isn’t something when a lady gets jeweled up and goes out at night. Then? A girl should marry the man she loves. She should spend the rest of her life with him. That is liberation. Liberation! That’s fine. What about your love? Tell us your story My mother-in-law knows about it. Don’t you, darling? I know. Let’s hear from you. My story is simple. I thought no one is as good as my father in this world. So, I decided to never get married. Then, I realized. Not all men are bad. Our system is at fault. Isn’t it Goms? I met Surendra then. I experienced his love within a few days of meeting and I trusted him. Most importantly, he respected me That’s the point! So, I asked him suddenly one day. I proposed marriage. Oh my! Wait! Your daughter-in-law is quite playful. Oh no! Check what happened. Someone got hit. What happened? Bleeding! How did it happen? Oh no! No idea what happened! Brother… Please go fast. Fast! Brother! Please go fast. Mother… Mother. O’ God! Mother! Mother. Hey! Get me Chicken. How long will you take? Get it fast. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] We are calling from Srinivasa Hospital. Your mother is in critical condition. Where are you? Come fast, sir. When will you come? Hello? [SONG PLAYING] This place is called Ghatil. The tribal folks leave guys and girls of puberty here. They mingle with each other and marry the one they like. Isn’t it awesome? The village should be like this. Yours is useless. Hello, Prabha. – Prabha! Please come… Hi, sister. Wow! How are you? Good… How are you? I am good. How about you? Where’s your husband? Shankar! He’s over there. Hey, Shankar… Thank you, Prabha. She is such a sincere girl. Thank you, Prabha. I know. Who are they? That is Subbu. Rani. – Hello. And Goms! Goms! He’s Roop Singh Goud! Greetings! He helps these people here. He runs a Trust! Is it? Okay, I am coming. What’s happening there? It’s a wedding, madam. A wedding! Go and see it! It'd be awesome. Yeah! Wedding… My friend! How are you, buddy? Hey, Prathap! My friend! Kousalya! Perfect spot for your honeymoon, isn’t it? Hey, Munna. They’re coming. Check! Hello. Hello! Uncle! This is Prabha. I am here with Subbu. Her phone is with me. Thank God you answered. I was hoping that she wouldn’t pick the phone. Is she beside you? I didn’t want to say. But, I can’t help letting it out. Nothing, dear. My mother passed away. Listen! Don’t inform her now. Let her come back whenever she wants to. Get it? She has done a lot for us. She deserves to be happy. Let her be that way. Send her back safe and sound. Okay? Why because she’s got no one else. Hello? Women don’t give dowry here. Men should give dowry to women. Oh! Divorce is a cakewalk here. You can apply for it if you don’t like your partner. Oh! Later, you can spend your life with your loved ones. Shall I say something? What? We’d get separated today. Yes, we’d get separated. Hey, Subbu… Subbu, where are you going? Hey, wait. Subbu! Wait. What’s going on in your mind? What happened? Why aren’t you coming? Don’t be silly, Suri. You know that I took the risk to arrange this get together, don't you? How can you simply say that you missed your flight? Who wants you here next week? I took a lot of trouble to make it on this specific day. Otherwise, I would have brought them all here after Rani’s election is done, won’t I? Subbu has left behind her bedridden mother-in-law and came. Do you know that? Darling! Don’t you know about me? I’ll definitely come if I could. I am really really sorry. I don’t want your sorry. What, then? Tell me what I should do. You should… Come out. Oh! Are you playing with me? Hey! You are so good at this play. How can I not add up a little bit of spice to it? How are you? – I am good. How’s your hand? Better now. Your mom didn’t see you, right? I met you just now. How can I meet her? Come closer. It has been ages I embraced you. – No… Someone might see. – What? Leave me. Hi, senior! Brother! Need some spice? Hello, chicken-brother! Is that important now, brother? Hi. Hello. Hi. Hey, Subbu! Hey! Hey! Look at that water flow. Great waterfalls, isn’t it? It would be great if we go missing in this jungle, right? Gomu? Hey, Gomu! What happened? Why did we meet again? We’ve been separated for 38 years and suddenly united. We’d part ways again. It would have been better if we hadn’t met again. You have a family with children and grandchildren. You’ll have someone beside you even though you fight at times. She’s with me now. She’d settle abroad once she gets married. Where will I go? Do you think I am happy? My life would be similar to the army once I go back. I should obey their commands. I should wake up early before everyone else. I should be the last one to sleep. What should I do? Shall we just run away? Why should we suffer and stay with them? My mother-in-law keeps taunting me but might expire soon. How am I supposed to live with that drunkard? I would’ve jumped into the sea while talking if this rope didn’t exist. Hey, Subbu! Don’t talk shit. I am not sure if you’d jump or not. I am going to jump. Hey! What’s wrong with you now? Come. Goms! Will I reach heaven if I jump from here? Hey, Goms! – Come. Want to dive? Let’s try that tomorrow. Let’s go now. No…I will jump. Please come. Leave me. I said leave. Okay, jump. Okay! For your sake! You came here at the right moment. I just can’t express my gratitude. Do you realize what a great deed you’ve done? You united us after many decades. Thanks, Prabha. [MIMICS] Hey! Look over there. Goms, Rani, Subbu! It feels great to cook after getting fresh. Where do you work, bro? Qatar! It is near Dubai. I work for a star hotel. People there happily eat boiled veggies with salt and pepper. But, it doesn’t work that way here. Brother! What is your name? Karthik! Yeah, Karthik. Why are you idle? Peel these potatoes. Come on, brother. Come on. Take it. God of wealth blesses the house where a man cooks. It is a great blessing to cook for parents. It is a blessing for life if you cook for your wife. Am I right? Go straight into that room. What is it? Nothing much! Don’t ask me anything now. Just go. Wait… One minute… What’s that sound? I hear some noise. Is someone cooking? There’s nothing there. Ra! You got a package. Here it is, Ra. What is it? This is for you. Goms! What is this, dear? This is for you, Subbu. What is it? Okay! Don’t waste time. Go! Go and take a shower. What is it? Dress up well and come back with pretty faces. This soup brings an end to cooking. Prabha! Our team is ready. What about your team? Are hostel girls ready? Hey! Hush! What...what? Don’t scream. What? Why are you yelling? Hey! – Get inside. Go! Even I want to see them. Can’t you understand? Balaji, move. Are they ready? – Go inside. Are they coming? Balaji! Not here. Hide there. Yeah! Okay… You’re doing it at the right time. Hush! Don’t shout. What? Suri! Please go inside. I will explain it to you later. Just get inside. Will you come here? Just for 2 minutes! – Go! Please! Please come. – Go, dude. Prabha! Shall I hide here? Come and click pictures. Come. We are all ready! Prabha! We’re all ready. Can we come out? You can come out! Whoa… You look awesome. Hey! All of you come here. Okay. Goms! I have a question for you. Ask me If your son were present here, would you go with him or give importance to your friends? What kind of question is this? Is that even a question? Is it a worthy question? We’ve been friends for 38 years. I’ll go with them. I’ll ask him to get lost if he comes. Well said. Oh my! Gomatha! Hey! Suri? Move... My son is here. Move. I said, move. My dear son. What’s this, Gomatha? Suri! Is that your plan to separate my son and me? Oh my God! Suri! Oh no… Hey…I haven’t forgotten you. I was surprised to see him. Look, this is my son. I told you that he’s working abroad, right? Greetings. Greetings. How are you? Hey! When did you come? I came here when you were singing with your friends. You’ve lost weight. You got lean! Hush! Next question! It is for Rani Amrutha Kumari! I know what your question is. Is that the same question? Hey, Balaji! Archana? Where are you? How did you guess, mom? I asked you to come. Why wouldn’t I know? – Suri! Archana! I know her. Come here. How are you, aunty? I am good, dear. Did you bring my wallet? Yes. Give it to me. Greetings, aunt. What’s in that wallet, mom? Hush! Alright… That isn’t your question, Mrs. Rani. Think carefully and answer. Which child of yours do you love the most? Not these two! That would be my eldest son, Karthik. Alright! Okay. Karthik! Come out, brother. Come out. Brother! What happened? Who is that? Is it Karthik? Where is he? Hey! Mom! Karthik! What it is, dear? – Mom! What happened, dear? Get up. Get up. Forgive me, mom. I am a coward. I am a coward, mom. I am a coward, mom. Stop crying, dear. I was selfish and planned to make money using you. I am a coward… Don’t cry, dear. What happened? I will tell you. I did it without my knowledge. Okay, leave it. Hey, brother. – Mom! Brother! Get up. I made a big mistake. It is okay. Get up. I made a mistake. Get him some water, please. It’s okay. Stop crying first. Drink water. Don’t cry. Brother. Drink some water. Please. This happened because of me, mom. Please drink some water. Drink up… Okay. Alright! No problem. Come on. Hey, Subbu! You got a call. This looks like a familiar face. My husband! Subbu… Tell me. Hey! Get up. Why are being like that? Please get up. Nothing happened now. Leave it. Okay, leave it. Just be happy. Don’t come right away. I will take care of everything. What will you handle? You couldn't take care of four days? What will you do now? Hang up now. I’ll come. Come whenever you want, Subbu. You won’t see me as a drunkard when you return. I gave up alcohol. I called you to say that. What happened? Aunty! What happened? What is it? Your mother-in-law passed away? My husband gave up alcohol. Oh no! I’ll smack you. Hey! Come. Uncle gave up alcohol. Sit down. Suri... Our brother changed his mind and talked to his mother. Sit. Sit, brother. We have arranged a feast for you. Oh! Smile. Hey, move. But before that… So, the feast is all about… Yes! My mother is darling! What’s all that? What’s this suspense? Do you know why I took a risk and made sure you’re together at this moment? What’s special about today? Why because today is October 30th ! Today was the day you parted ways at college. Did we part ways today? How do you know that this is the day? Gomatha! What, dear. You were expelled from the college for watching a film at night by escaping from the hostel. Yes… Which movie was that? Which movie is it? Chiranjeevi’s movie, right? – No! I don’t remember. No! It is Balakrishna’s movie. I think it is Nagarjuna’s movie. – No! No! We went to Chiranjeevi’s movie, right? What was that movie? I think the movie name is ‘Gorintaaku’. Yeah…we went to watch ‘Gorintaaku’. Yes! That movie got released on October 30th ! Oh my! Brother, take this. Play the film now. Ready! 1…2…3! [BELL RINGING] Like a Cuckoo waiting for sunrise… Like a Frog waiting for rain… My dear viewers who wait to watch this beautiful show… Subbu is here to host! Is it good? Whoa! Perfect shot! You killed it! Come here and check on the monitor. It is fantastic! Don’t be happy that we have won. There could be some issues from the opposition Party. You have to be strong and stand them. I have 35 years of experience. I’ll handle it. You go ahead. You’ll learn! Concerned people would handle. You may leave now. Wave! Mom! The visa would be ready in a few days. Aren’t you my darling? You’ll come here by flight and stay with me. Oh no! I will not come there. You can come to visit me if you’re free. I’ll come to visit you whenever I am free. Mom! Stop being sarcastic about it. What will you do there alone? Goms! Even if you become old, do whatever you like. It is up to you! That sounds good. You’re my darling. Hey! Why are you giving her instructions? I am talking to my mom. Why do you interfere? She’s like my mother too. – Do you know what her age is? What? Has she become old already? Who’s old? Do you want to check out my fans? – Are you both teasing me? Girls and Boys! Yay!
