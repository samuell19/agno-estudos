'Someone great once said lndia's..' '..soul resides in its villages.' 'When he said this he was either ignorant of the truth..' '..orjust plain naiiive.' 'Because even today many places of this country..' '..are embroiled in gory battles.' 'One such place is Anandpur..' '..where people in the fight for ego, women and power..' '..put their lands, their properties..' '..their families and even their lives at stake.' 'And this cycle of violence continues..' '..generation after generation without ever taking a pause.' 'ln Anandpur's violent battles..' '..so much blood has been shed..' '..that the so-called soul of lndia..' '..instead of residing here is mourning somewhere else.' 'This violent history of Anandpur..' '..is Rakhta Charitra (history drenched in blood).' 'Narsimha Deva Reddy is the most powerful MLA..' '..of Anandpur province.' 'Veerbhadra is Narsimha's close aide..' '..who in spite of belonging to a lower caste..' '..due his hardworking nature and dedication..' '..became indispensable for Narsimha..' '..and Narsimha used to hand him..' '..over all his important tasks..' '..and take his advice in all crucial matters.' 'Veerabhadra's growing popularity..' '..and influence in this province made..' '..people of Narsimha's caste..' '..especially Nagamani Reddy extremely jealous.' 'He was just waiting..' '..for an opportunity to remove Veerabhadra out of the way.' 'And on the other hand the intelligent, ideal Veerabhadra..' '..as the leader of the backward..' '..and the underprivileged classes went about working..' '..to win the upcoming district council elections..' '..for the development of his province and his people.' With Narsimha Reddy's blessings.. ..in this year's district council election.. ..only candidates from amongst us are going to contest.. ..for every seat on our party's behalf. From now onwards our people would get at least.. ..eight hours' work everyday and get clean drinking water.. ..and along with our children's education.. ..they will also have bright future prospects. Mr. Reddy, keeping his faith in us, in our hard work.. ..and in our loyalty has put this responsibility.. ..on our shoulders. We too in return should work doubly hard.. ..and sustain his faith in us. And we will do it. l promise you that with your help together we will.. ..realize Narsimha Reddy's every dream. Mr. Reddy. Our people are angry. Veerabhadra.. ..is allotting most of the seats for.. ..the district council elections to the people of his caste. What do you mean by 'People of his caste'? ln our constituency there are many people.. ..of Veerabhadra's caste. We have to look after everyone. Veerabhadra is doing the right thing. He is not doing. He is just saying. What do you mean? He is using you. He is slowly taking your power into his hands. You are sitting here at home and he is going around town.. ..telling everyone that he is the real leader. You will face dual blows because of that. How come? -You are becoming weak among our people. And among other castes where you should've won.. ..some brownie points he is walking away with the credit. Your grandfather once told you something.. Sister. Wow! ( Team DhRz ) What a pleasant surprise! ( Team DhRz ) That's not the thing, sister. You know how is it.. We don't have time to breathe.. ..ever since his election work has begun. We have to make tea and snacks for hundreds of people. There's always a rush at home. -lt happens. Greetings, sister. So Veerabhadra.. l hear some complaints against you. Sister-in-law, after marriage even praises.. ..sound like complaints. -Ok. Ok. Don't justify yourself now. l got hold of you after a long time. Please sit down. l will make some coffee for you. Sir, Mr. Narsimha is calling you. -l'll be back in a while. Sister.. ..l will prepare the rasam (sort of tamarind soup) today. But what happened? Why did you cancel their seats all of a sudden? Do l have to answer that? l don't want to get into an argument. l have taken the decision. But Mr. Reddy, you gave me the right.. ..to take decision regarding this matter earlier. Don't argue with me. You may not want to answer.. ..but l have to answer my people. -Your people? When did they become your people? You think you are their lord? l gave them my word. With whose permission did you give them your word? Mr. Reddy, after working for you for all these years.. ..and after doing whatever l did for you.. ..you are asking me this question today? -Hey! ( Team DhRz ) Have you done us a favor by working here? ln return Mr. Narsimha has done so much for you. l understand everything, Nagamani. Everything. Mr. Reddy, l have been patient till now. Before this matter gets worse.. -Hey! ( Team DhRz ) You are threatening Mr. Narsimha? What's that look? Look down. Look down! ( Team DhRz ) No, no, no. -lt will taste great. What are you doing! ( Team DhRz ) So much spice? He won't eat it. No! ( Team DhRz ) lf you won't add this much spice.. ..they won't even touch it here. Add some more. That's why there's so much aggression in you people. They like it very spicy. -Nari. Let's go from here. -What happened? -l said let's go. But what happened? -l said let's go. Let's go from here. Let's go. -What.. At least let me wash my hand. What happened? Why is Veerabhadra leaving in a huff? Don't take that traitor's name in front of me. You know what all he was saying behind my back? Society is nobody's personal property. Higher caste. Lower caste. lt's all rubbish. This is just one man's battle against another. Which book says it, in which Veda is it written.. ..that we are born to be their slaves and to serve them? And if it's written anywhere, then burn that writing down. Cut the tongues of those who call you untouchable. Gouge out those eyes which don't see you as human beings. Till now no one had dared to look into your eyes. And he.. He used to live at your feet till yesterday. And today he is abusing you in front of everyone. You get a chance only once in life to prove your worth. And no one gives you that chance. You have to snatch it. He turned your people against you. Mr. Narsimha, you fed milk to that snake.. ..and today he is ready to bite you. The sickle that your ancestors used to cut the harvest.. ..that they cultivated for those rogues.. Now the time has come to use the same sickles.. ..to cut their heads and drench this land with their blood. From this moment onwards we are going to fight for our rights. What should be done if a branch revolts against the stem! ( Team DhRz ) We should cut it. We should cut it out. Get rid of him. Durga. You know Manda, don't you? -Manda, who? Veerbhadra's right hand man.. You know Lord Shiva's temple.. ..behind Kailash general stores, right? His home is right next to it. Hey! ( Team DhRz ) -Don't be scared. lf we had come to kill you, you would be dead by now. Mr. Nagamani wants to talk to you. We will send your husband back. But if you talk to anyone.. ..about this incident before he comes.. ..your husband will come back, but without his head. You have only two choices. Either you join hands with us and kill Veerabhadra.. ..or say no to us and die. Look, Manda, we can kill Veerabhadra without your help.. ..but we need you to kill both him and his reputation. lf we kill Veerbhadra his voters and supporters.. ..will turn against us in the elections. You are his most loyal man. lf you kill him, people will doubt.. ..the great man himself. And also, what will you get if you work for him? Today you are his servant. Tomorrow you will be.. ..his sons Shankar's and Pratap's servant. But if you kill him.. You can become the leader. After Ravan's death Ram didn't get Lanka's throne.. ..but Vibhishan got it. What happened? -There are some stones on the road. Must be someone's mischief. Go back. Go back. Go. Go. Hey, Veerabhadra. Veerabhadra, we are here to kill you. There are 40-50 innocent people along with you in the bus. To kill you we will kill them all if required. Now will you hide among them like a woman.. ..and be the cause of their deaths or will you come out.. ..like a man and die alone. You decide. Where are you going? You are not going anywhere. Leave me. -They will kill you. You don't go. Don't go. -Don't go. You don't worry at all. -You don't go. Nothing will happen to you. -Please don't go. Nothing will happen to you. -Please don't go.. l'll talk to them. -Please don't go. -Don't go. l said l will talk to them. -Don't go out. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Please come inside. How can l? -Please come inside. lt's a matter of many lives. Leave me. Who are you? Come in front of me and talk. Manda. -Yes. You rogue! ( Team DhRz ) -Hey, Manda, what's happened to you? Why are you doing this? Sister-in-law, He is a thief. Sister-in-law, he was trying to fool everyone. What did you think? You thought we won't find out? You.. You cheated everyone. Today on everyone's behalf l have come to teach you a lesson. On whose behalf? What are you talking about? l am talking on everyone's behalf. What's happened to you? -What are you talking about? Till now l used to think that you are a good man. That's why l worked for you. Do you all know this? He devoured party's fund. l will kill you. Kill me if you want to.. -No. -..but don't lecture. Kill him, Manda. l must get the punishment for trusting a man like you. Come on, kill me. -Shoot him, Manda. Move away. Shoot me. -Please come in. -Shoot him, Manda. Please come in. -Shoot me. What are you staring at? Shoot me. -Manda, shoot him. Shoot him, Manda. -Shoot me. Shoot me. What are you looking at? Shoot me. What are you waiting for? -Shoot me. You remember the deal with Nagamani? Everyone must see you killing him. Go. Go and kill him. Don't ruin everything, Manda. Go and kill him fast. Leave me. Leave me. Everyone is watching. Go and kill him. Go, or else the deal is off. Go. Everyone is watching. Go. Leave me. Leave me. No. No. No. No. No. Manda, no. Manda, no. Manda, no. Manda, no. Manda, no. Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. Manda, no. Manda, no. Manda, no. No! ( Team DhRz ) Unfortunate. Quite unfortunate. Your own man killed him. What can anyone do.. ..if the enemy is hidden in our house? l know very well who killed him. Manda killed your father in front of a hundred people. Manda. Manda killed my father in front of everyone. But l know that behind Manda.. ..there are Narsimha Reddy and Nagamani Reddy. Manda alone didn't kill him. lt was done by those people.. ..for whom my father worked all these years. Veerbhadra isn't dead yet. His sons are alive. So they want bloodshed. l will shed their blood. Blood will spill every day and every moment here now. And it won't stop till this land is drenched with their blood. Anandpur. What sort of a place is your Anandpur? lt's a nice place to live. lt's an even better place to leave. So you will stay in the city? -Yes. What's your father's name? -Veerabhadra. Are you a Brahmin? -No. Do you believe in God? First l believe in myself. You couldn't touch his feet? -Whose? Yes, his feet. Father would've been impressed. Nandini, l never do what l don't like. What's there in it not to like? What's the need for all this? l am marrying you. l'm not marrying your father. But if you wish l have no problem in touching your feet. You want a slap from me? And what did you say? First l believe in myself and then l believe in God. He's in you. He's in me. He's in my father too. What would you have lost if you had said one small lie? l never lie. -Now don't lie. Hey, where's the cherry in this? lf this was our first meeting, forget about talking to you.. ..l wouldn't even have looked at you. l don't understand why you are so difficult. Nandini, honest people always come across as difficult. Just shut up. Talking to you is of no use. What happened? Nandini.. My.. My father.. l need to go home. Urgently. 'What Nandini doesn't know now is that..' '..Pratap is walking down a path of no return.' 'After Veerabhadra's brutal murder..' '..Pratap's brother Shankar who couldn't..' '..attack Nagamani Reddy..' '..and Narsimha Deva Reddy because..' '..of the increased security..' '..was living in the forest and attacking their supporters.' 'As a consequence of these guerilla attacks..' '..a new character makes an entry into Raktha Chritra..' '..who was worse than a demon.' 'He is Nagamani Reddy's son Bukka Reddy.' 'On hearing about Shankar's exploits he started killing..' '..Shankar's men in the most brutal way possible.' 'Bukka Reddy was not just an exponent of violence..' '..but he molested every woman he fancied..' '..irrespective of their caste, creed, religion, age..' '..place or time..' Leave me. Leave me. Help! ( Team DhRz ) Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. Rajeev. Rajeev. Leave me. Leave me. Help! ( Team DhRz ) 'Consumed with the cocktail of alcohol, women and power..' '..day and night he proved himself..' '..to be worse than a demon.' No. No. Forgive me. Forgive me. 'Bukka had already dragged Anandpur back from..' '..20th century to a different era where there we no rules.' 'And now on hearing about Shankar's brother..' '..Pratap's arrival he came out of his burrow.' Stop. Where are you going? We heard Shankar's brother Pratap Ravi has come. Wait till the elections are over. Till election are over.. Come up stair. 'The number of people with a gun in hand..' '..kept increasing in this region.' 'lnstead of tilling their farms..' '..farmers started manufacturing bombs.' 'Blood replaced water in canals.' 'Democracy turned into ajoke.' 'The age-old poverty and poor man's fight for survival..' '..when landlords and capitalists are on assault.' 'Now Pratap Ravi stepped into such environment.. ..of Anandpur..' He's Durga. He's one of those who killed father. The rest of them will also be caught. Enough.. -What are the policemen doing? Matters have reached this far only because of the policemen. Forget it. You don't interfere in all this. You concentrate on your studies. Father also wanted the same. You study. Look Ravi, other than taking revenge from father's killers.. ..l also have the responsibility to.. ..get justice for his followers. Till everyone doesn't get justice.. ..l won't stop my struggle. Forget it. How is mother? -'With his father's brutal death..' '..Pratap's dream of a great future burst like a bubble.' 'Like many people present here..' '..Pratap started understanding the..' '..realities of his homeland..' '..which he had been hearing since his childhood.' 'lt's not a fight for blood.' 'lt's a fight for self-esteem, for identity.' 'But at present it can't be told..' '..how deep or above Pratap is of this whirlpool.' How is Shankar? How is he? -Yes. Your friend.. some girl called Nandini called. Why would anyone kill anyone.. ..so brutally without a reason? Such people will stay in our house? ls it visible on anyone's face that he.. ..would have support of such people? Thank God that you are sitting safe at home. Look, Nandini. Everyone commits mistakes. Forget Pratap now. Father, l love Pratap. Till l know what's the reason behind all this.. ..l won't change my decision. -Look.. Hello! ( Team DhRz ) Nandini.. Pratap. Pratap? Where are you? l hope you are fine. What happened, Pratap? They killed my father, Nandini. No! ( Team DhRz ) -l never knew that they could do so. Mother and sister-in-law are unable to bear it. Now, police are looking for my brother. Shankar. We found him. Alive? -Yes. Goodbye. Where is Shankar? -Shankar? Who is Shankar? My brother, Shankar. Who are you? -My name is Pratap. -So? l learnt that my brother is here. Here? Where? -Here in your police station. Who told you? -Look, l've learnt it. You've arrested him today. Where's my brother? Hey! ( Team DhRz ) Lower your voice! ( Team DhRz ) Lower it! ( Team DhRz ) l will thrash you black and blue. Pratap hasn't done anything wrong. He doesn't have any criminal case too. lt's your responsibility to let him meet his brother.. ..as per the law. Who are you? l am the lawyer. ldiot! ( Team DhRz ) Here l am the law. l am the law. You want to meet your brother? -Yes. Come, l will show you. Come. See him. Go and meet your brother. Did you meet your brother? l killed him as per the law. Now do whatever you can do. Let go off him! ( Team DhRz ) Let go off me! ( Team DhRz ) Let go off me! ( Team DhRz ) ldiot! ( Team DhRz ) You are done for today! ( Team DhRz ) How dare you hit me! ( Team DhRz ) Ramesh, take care of sister-in-law. We are taking Pratap along with us. Pratap! ( Team DhRz ) Mr. Reddy, we lost both my husband and my elder son. Now l don't have anyone other than Pratap. Sister. Sister. We'll go away from here. We don't want anything. We will go far away from here. l will pacify Pratap. He'll surely listen to me. My son never says no to me, sister. Mr. Reddy. Mr. Reddy.. l beg of you. Sir, if my son has any feeling of revenge.. ..l will ask him to wipe it out. l will ask him to wipe it out. l assure you, sir. -Stop it! ( Team DhRz ) l assure.. -Stop it! ( Team DhRz ) You think by asking us to not harm your son.. ..you are doing us a favor? Your husband.. We took care of your husband. And he tried to bite us in return. He tried to bite us. Your son Shankar tried to kill Narsimha. Go. Go away! ( Team DhRz ) Your son, Pratap cannot escape by hiding in the forest.. We will kill him at any cost. -Hey, throw her out! ( Team DhRz ) Throw her out! ( Team DhRz ) -Sister! ( Team DhRz ) Sister! ( Team DhRz ) -Hey! ( Team DhRz ) Sister, please listen to me! ( Team DhRz ) -Throw her out. -Sister! ( Team DhRz ) Pratap, they have got power. They have police's support. They have the government on their side. But still we will see how long they will escape. We revere your father and brother Shankar.. ..more than you do. Not just you, but they have got enemies.. ..all over Anandpur. You stay here. Don't be scared. We will protect you. We'll take revenge. No. l will take that revenge. Don't get emotional. Have you ever held a gun in your life? -No. Not with the gun.. l will stab each one of them to death with a knife. We can understand your anger. lt's easier said than done. Leave this to us. My father.. My brother.. My mother.. Revenge will be mine too. We'll plan to kill Narsimha, Nagamani, Manda.. ..all the three of them at one go at the same time. No. Not at once. One at a time. One by one. After killing one, l will give another one.. ..specific time of his death. So that he should feel the fear of death. l won't let them die so easily. Planned by Nagamani, implemented by Manda.. ..and ordered by Narsimha Reddy. l will kill the three of them. My mother used to treat Narsimha Reddy's wife.. ..Gomati as her own sister. My mother was humiliated in front of her. My mother was kicked and she didn't utter a word. First of all.. l will make her cry. Hey, when you father and son were roaming in the town.. ..he came here and killed him. His mother used to call me sister. She came here and begged me to spare her son. Why didn't you kill him earlier? You just kept thinking. Why? Why didn't you kill him earlier? Why you didn't kill him? Why didn't you kill him? Why didn't you kill him? Why didn't you kill him? Why didn't you kill him? Hey Bukka. Shut up! ( Team DhRz ) Just shut up! ( Team DhRz ) Aunt is right. We should've killed him right in the beginning. This happened because of you. Wait till the elections are over. You asked me to wait till the elections are over. You will make his dead body contest the election now? Bukka. -Shut up! ( Team DhRz ) Keep your mouth shut! ( Team DhRz ) Aunt, l'm Nandini speaking. Pratap must've told you about me. Yes, l know. How are you? l am fine, aunt. Aunt, where is Pratap? -l don't know. Yesterday.. yesterday on TV.. ..they were saying that Pratap in involved in.. ..Narsimha Reddy's death. ls it true, aunt? l want it to be true. Aunt, l can't live without Pratap. Just because you are a woman.. -Leave me.. ..if you think l will spare you.. -No.. ..you are wrong. lf you don't tell me where Pratap is.. ..l will cut you into pieces. l will first cut your hand. -Hey, stop! ( Team DhRz ) Leave her. Leave her or else l will shoot your head. Leave her! ( Team DhRz ) Forgive me, mother. l didn't know that Bukka Reddy would stoop so low. Forget it, Pratap. Who could've imagined that Bukka would stoop to such a level? Have it, madam. Have it. Enough. Enough. -A little more. By the way, l forgot to tell you.. Nandini called. l'm sorry. Two minutes. Whatever you heard about me is true. l'm the one who killed Narsimha Reddy. ln future l will kill some others as well. There are some reasons behind it. And there are many people out there who want to kill me. Because of that people close to me will also be in danger. Now you have to take the decision.. ..if you want to be with a person like me or not. l have decided it. l didn't come here to take your permission.. but to tell you. l am taking your daughter along with me. l'll take care of Nandini more than you. lf you wish you can bless us.. ..and even if you don't l don't care. God bless you. Hey, rich man.. Hey, rich man.. Hey, rich man.. Hey, rich man..'' Rich man.. down, down! ( Team DhRz ) Hey, rich man.. Hey, rich man..'' You've become richer by tormenting the poor.'' You kill poor people for your food.'' Eat your food and have fun. No matter you are landlord or a king.'' We'll surely overpower you. Hey, rich man.. Hey, rich man.. Hey. Hey. Down! ( Team DhRz ) Down! ( Team DhRz ) Down! ( Team DhRz ) Down! ( Team DhRz ) You live your life in luxury because of the poor.'' Your government is filthy. My dagger is thirsty.'' We've announced it. The public will fear us. You've become richer by tormenting the poor.'' You kill poor people for your food.'' Hey, rich man.. Hey, rich man.. Hey, rich man.. Get lost, you rich man. You live in air-conditioned room. You get everything for free. We do the hard work.. ..and you enjoy its fruits. We are not worth of applying scent on our clothes. You don't tolerate our oily hair. Rich man. Get lost, you rich man. They can burn down the jungle. They can even eat a poisonous snake. Rich man! ( Team DhRz ) Hey, rich man.. Hey, rich man Hey, rich man.. Hey, rich man.. Hey, rich man.. Hey, rich man Hey, rich man.. Hey, rich man.. How long do we have to bear this, sir? Right in front of my eyes he.. -Ashwini. From the home minister to the constable.. ..there is a parallel system running. That system consists not just of us but also of criminals. No matter what we do we must keep this in mind. There was an inspector here before you. What was his name.. Gajapati Rao. He used to work less for the department.. ..and more for Nagamani Reddy. This is what will happen after you. Just because you are an honest police officer.. ..you can't change things in one day. -Well-said, sir. You? When did you come? This morning. l came for some information. l'm on my way to Hyderabad l thought of dropping by.. ..and saying 'Hello' to you. -Great. Meet her, Ashwini Sinha. And he is Mohan Prasad, intelligence officer. Hello, Ms. Ashwini! ( Team DhRz ) -Hi! ( Team DhRz ) l have heard a lot about you. l too have heard a lot about you. Pleasure meeting you. -Same here. Thank you. Have. -No, sir, you have it. -Hey, have it. lt's very tasty. No, sir. You have it. -Have it. lt's very tasty. Have it. -No, thanks, sir. You have it. We caught a sugarcane lorry this morning. Vijayawada stuff. Full of sugarcane. Come on, have it. -Sir, no, thanks. You have it. Come on. Fresh and juicy. -Sir, l don't want it. lt is very nice. -What's your issue? You don't need to brush your teeth if you have it. Biggest.. -Sir. l don't want it, sir. Ok. -Ya. Thanks. Mr. Mohan, you think what Mr. Kanungo said is right? No, what l mean.. by the time the system changes.. ..Bukka Reddy will ruin everything.. ..then we can't save anything. That's what l think. Ruining and saving is a point of view, Ms. Ashwini. lf you leave it to the courts of justice, it'd be much better. Police shouldn't be working as per their wish.. ..but as per the procedure. That's called constitution. lt doesn't support anyone. Nor is it against anyone. -Alright. So you're saying police should just ignore whatever happens. Right? -That's right. Like Mahatma Gandhi's three monkeys. See no evil. Hear no evil. Speak no evil. -This rule stands till we get a chance. And we will get our chance only after the election. Film-star Shivaji has established a new party. There may be a new change in the state. Only after we know the result.. ..we will know how to play the game. Shivaji Rao has called for a meeting in Anandpur. Did you know? Now we have to wait and watch.. ..what Bukka Reddy's reaction will be. 'Bukka Reddy tried his best to kill Pratap Ravi..' '..but he could never reach Pratap..' '..who was hiding in the forest.' My father's spirit is wandering around. Here. There. lnside me. He is chasing me everywhere. Day and night he is asking me the same question.. Bukka. Hey, Bukka. What are you doing? Why didn't you kill Ravi yet? l'll kill him. When will you kill him? Pratap, Ravi.. till l kill everyone in his family.. ..father's soul won't rest in peace. His soul will wander! ( Team DhRz ) His soul will wander. His soul will wander. Till l mix Pratap's blood in whiskey and drink it.. ..l can't sleep in peace. l can't sleep in peace. 'Meanwhile the elections were declared.' 'Keeping in view his party's declining popularity..' '..the shock of his father Nagamani Reddy's death..' '..and Pratap's growing influence..' '..Bukka Reddy chose his brother Puru..' '..Reddy to contest in the election.' He's contesting the election. My brother.. must win. Whoever contests against him chop his legs. And what about Shivaji? l told you.. ..whoever it is. 'Shivaji Rao is the movie-star who..' '..played some iconic roles on screen..' '..and won a place in people's hearts..' 'He thought that if people would stand in a queue to..' '..watch his movies, then they would vote for him as well.' 'Shivaji called for public meetings all over the state..' '..with the faith that people who threw coins..' '..when he appeared on screen as a hero in movies..' '..would also throw flowers at him when he appears..' '..in front of them as a political leader.' 'Thinking this Shivaji held meetings at every corner..' '..of the city.' 'He came to Anandpur for the same.' 'But he didn't know..' 'Bukka ruled this place.' 'Bukka Reddy made superstar Shivaji Rao, who could easily..' '..thrash hundred odd villains at a time in his movies..' '..flee like a coward from the Anandpur meeting.' 'Shivaji's ego was badly hurt with this incident.' 'He asked his adviser Ram Murthy..' '..who is behind this attack?' Bukka Reddy, our opposition contestant's brother. According to the locals.. Bukka is a demon. lt is said that, if a snake bites him snake gets poisoned. Don't mouth cinema dialogues, Ram Murthy. How come a demon like Bukka exists in a democracy? What can l say, sir? He exists. That's how it is. What you are saying is that there is no one.. ..in this whole city, who can challenge a demon like Bukka? There is one. His father's Veerabhadrayya. -We'll fight for our rights. Brother Shankar. -Now there will be bloodshed. They both were killed! ( Team DhRz ) The one born to take revenge is Pratap. Call him here. Pratap? Purpose? Shivaji. Have a seat. l have heard a lot about you. A lot. l hope at least a part of it is true. l don't know what you have heard. What did you tell me his name was? -Pratap. Pratap. l like you. You are a bad person doing good things. Your good is good and bad is good too. But brother, your level is very low. l am a great man. Even though democracy and l are great.. ..we cannot touch even a small fly like Bukka. An ant doesn't die if elephant steps on it. lt has to be crushed. You have the guts to do it. Though you are here, Bukka still exists.. brother.. Only because of the revolution. What harm has anyone done in so many years? lf you leave behind blood and gore.. ..and enter politics you will become.. ..the undisputed king of this place. lf we merge our powers we could do a lot. You look smart to me. You have intelligence. Use your brains. But think fast. Topic is over. What do you think? -How can we trust him? What are you thinking, Pratap? Pratap, Bukka's atrocities are not new to us.. ..but after what he did to him l feel like.. What happened? -Babu, tell him. My name is Babu Khadri. l am an electrician. When l went out of town on motor wiring work.. l have a sister aged 16. By the time l heard about it and came back.. ..Bukka had raped my sister and thrown her on the road. When l took my sister to the police station.. The police refused to lodge my complaint. They said, what's the guarantee that my sister has been raped? What's the guarantee that my sister is telling the truth? Because of disgrace, she immolated herself. While taking to the hospital she died on the way. When l saw my sister's dead body.. ..l couldn't control my anger.. you all work for that Bukka. Everyone knows what sort of a man that Bukka is. The whole village knows that Bukka's men abducted my sister.. l will kill Bukka! ( Team DhRz ) You wait and watch police can't harm me. l had lodged a complaint in the police. l had come to you. l raped your sister. l would even rape your grandmother. Bukka, we are going to Satyanarayana Reddy's.. ..house for the veneration. You want to come? -No. Have a seat. Not just to you, but Bukka did injustice to.. ..many poor people like you. But l want you to forget about him for the time being. Because you have the responsibility to look after.. ..your wife and mother. Don't think you are alone. We all are there behind you. l promise you. You'll surely avenge them. Go. Go and take care of your family. Forget Bukka for the time being. When we killed Narsimha Reddy, Nagamani Reddy.. ..took his place. When we killed him Bukka took his place. lf we kill Bukka someone else will take his place. The system is to be blamed for all this. That's why first of all we have to change this system. ln effect l have to become the system. What Mr. Shivaji said is right. Political power is more powerful than gun-power. l have to get that.. ..because the hands that are stopping us.. ..today will salute us tomorrow. l'll fulfill father's and brother's dreams..

( Team DhRz ) l'll kill all of you. lf l go to town leaving this jungle.. ..it will be very easy for our enemies to kill me. Bullets can come from anywhere anytime. You have to understand only one thing that.. ..Bukka is not our only enemy, there are many others too. l learnt that his brother Puru Reddy had been to.. .. Mangalore to meet some people. Nagmani and Narsimha Reddy's family members.. ..and some supporters are also making some plans. We have to be very alert all the time. Before anyone attacks, we've to uproot all the dangers.

Those who live in forests can go to any extent, Bukka. The goons in the city are in his hands. This is the safest place for you for the time being. You stay here. Are you not our father's son? Are you not our father's son? That rogue killed our father. He dragged us to streets like dogs. My blood is boiling to see his photos in newspapers.. ..and on TV everyday. My blood is boiling! ( Team DhRz ) My blood is boiling! ( Team DhRz ) My blood is boiling! ( Team DhRz ) -Bukka, no! ( Team DhRz ) Bukka, no. l won't die. l won't die. l will die only after killing him. Look, get me out of here anyhow.. or l'll kill myself. 'Bukka had not spat on his brother, Puru's face..' '..but on his self-esteem..' 'So, he went to meet Sirji.. who was a minister..' '..in Shivaji's opposition party.' 'Among sir's many great qualities..' '..one is to show people things exactly..' '..the way they want to see.' 'His voice was his identity.' 'Puru Reddy had to beg from him now.' 'But Sirji doesn't even give alms for free.' l need to meet Sirji. Mr. Naidu.. father, Bukka, and l, all of us worked for your party.

'..and started making arrangements to kill Ravi.' 'Pratap's men started worrying a bit.' 'Pratap used a pawn in such situation.' 'Patap's action team started wandering like bats.. ..around that flat.' 'When Bukka's 16 year old servant came out to buy.. ..vegetables, Pratap got him kidnapped.' How much does Bukka pay you per month? Sir.. Sir.. 500 rupees. l will give you 500,000. 'The real game began now.' 'Pratap gathered all the information about Bukka..' '..and went to Shivaji's house.'

Bukka. l made a team to kill him. You have to lead it. l have served the meals. lncluding me.. ..there are many people who have a reason to kill Bukka. After hearing your story l felt.. ..this is time to take your revenge. Bukka is staying in Maheshwari complex.. ..in Masabtank. Reach there from wood bridge. There's a police station behind the complex. So you have to hurry up in doing things.. ..but be careful as it is a densly populated area. Make sure nothing happens to any innocent person.

'..but everyone was afraid of taking Pratap Ravi's name..' '..except for some of Shivaji's party members.' He got Bukka and his men slain.. ..right in the centre of the state capital in broad daylight.. ..and then he sits in the assembly hall. Pratap has turned democracy into ajoke, sir. He is a killer. And you are supporting him, sir. Come, Pratap. Come. Sit down. They are giving me a hard time since an hour. They are asking me to kick you out of the party. What did you say? Pratap turned democracy into ajoke? And what about the time when democracy.. ..was laughing at Pratap? You are saying Pratap is a killer. Yes, he is a killer. Even Lord Ram and Lord Krishna killed people.. ..for the welfare of mankind. You should see whom he killed. Why he killed them? Did he kill some noble person? Bukka Reddy was a demon. Pratap is my Ram. Topic is over! ( Team DhRz ) Government's first duty is to keep law and order in place. Police department are there to oversee it.

Mother prepared it especially for you. Take this. People say that 100 years ago there was nothing here. This whole area was ajungle. Tigers, wolves, foxes and many more animals.. ..used to roam around here. Along with time.. slowly the city spread.. ..the population increased the jungle disappeared. The jungle disappeared, but still some animals.. ..are left behind here.. in the form of human beings. They run gangs in their areas and run illegal businesses.. ..and trouble the common man. l hope you got what l am saying. From now on.. right away.. ..none of you.. ..will run gangs or kill anyone.. ..or seize anyone's land. This is not a request. lt's an order. Nandini.. -Yes? Serve them some dessert. 'People's nature is such that no matter whatever..' '..you do for them they won't have any gratitude for you.' 'lt may be democracy or anything else.' 'Pratap knew this before coming into politics.' 'So, he tried to do many things.' 'The FlR written in the police station..' '..would become an announcement at Pratap's door.' 'Ravi used to solve cases in no time..'
