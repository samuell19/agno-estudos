It's my fault. I shouldn't have raised this dog. I came a lone from Hong Kong. I run chained clinics for psychotherapy. I just want to have a companion. Are you thinking of someone? In day time, I work in a clinic of a factory as a doctor. At night, I have a part time in the veterinary clinic. To cure pets. I must be responsible for not getting it cured. Or, I must pay for the loss. No, you don't have to pay that. You don't have to be responsible for that. Come to me if you need help. This is the clinic of our factory. Nice, nice place. This is a nice place. Really nice. I've got an idea. I want to undertake it. What? I suggest a co-operation with you. We'll run this clinic together. A clinic for psychotherapy. The targets are the workers of this factory. Is it great? You know? Nowadays, the biggest problem of these people is... they're psychologically sick rather than physically sick. They don't look happy at all. We don't know why They never smile It's because they've got pressure, and they don't know how to get a relief. The workers in our factory... They're tough and strong. They don't need psychologist. However, everyone needs to pour out. And you... Why did you come to me? What do you want to say? Why are we here? What do you have in mind? Well, I don't... I don't have any friend to pour out. Well, you look... You're young and look smart. You're sophisticated. I'd like to chat with you. For something, please help me to make decision. You've come to a right person. What are you laughing at? Take it easy! You came to me... Not for this? No. I am sorry. I'm old. This is not my cup of tea. I am sorry. I am sorry, lady. You'd take your wife here. Come and take a look. A man working alone needs caring. I haven't got married yet. I am afraid that I won't work long in that veterinary clinic. I'm pregnant, but it's not a good time. Hey! Can you swim? Not very good at that. So, learn it. My mom doesn't let me go swimming. That's for your own good. I wish to learn diving in this summer. Why? I just want to take a look under the water. Does my dad's suit fit me? A little. Put some in. Try it. Mom. It's meal time. I quit alcohol from today. Mom, try it, it tastes like what dad did before. You repeated it couple of times. Why can't you make it? Xiao-chuan. It's hot, but don't swim. It's alright. What do you mean? The river is always flooded this year. I heard that someone got drowned few days ago. Who said so? Did you witness that? I did. He is dead. He is drowned dead. Don't make noise when eating. You'd eat with a manner. My dad eats with noise too. Your dad is a taxi driver. Do you want to eat more? If not, learn something useful. You're nothing now. Eat with a proper manner. You've grown up. Behave yourself! Xiao-chuan. We haven't talked for quite a long time, huh? I can hardly recognize you. I have got laser eyes surgery. It spent me two thousand and something. But it's worth. She looks pretty. What do you think, Xiao-chuan? Hi. Where do you come from? Guangdong. You don't look like Cantonese. Cantonese girls are not like you. So what? How long have you been here? Two months. Are you kidding? All the girls say the same thing. What girls? Those whores. What are you? I think you know it. Will you tell me that you sell wine at the club? That's true. What a waste of you not being a whore. Xiao-chuan. Do you know what a whore is? Are you a whore? Yes or no? What do you think? Xiao-chuan. Why didn't you ask her... the reason of your father's death? Bin Jiang Road, Please. Slow down please. Please move a bit forward. closer closer More closer, please. More, please. Ah... Ah... Did you fight with Da Zhi? For Qing Qing? I hate men fighting for women. You're still young. Did your father teach you how to chase girls? Are you still angry? Is it worthy? Ah... Oh my leg! You got on the taxi at 3:40, right? Yes. The cops said the accident happened at five. I test it. From that KTV to the bridge, it takes only 15 minutes. Xiao-chuan. Calm down, okay? I just want to know... What happened in that hour? Nothing happened. Can you tell me? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me! Doctor. Is it all right? Can I walk? Will I become crippled? I can't be crippled. I earn my living with my legs. I'm fine. It's just a morning sick. I got pregnant. Too old, huh? I graduated from the nurse school, and was assigned to the medical unit of that factory. He was a worker there. I had many admirers at that time. That's the place he used to work. Plant Four. He worked in that unit for many years. Let's go and take a look. If not for earning more money, he wouldn't have become a taxi driver. So, your life is devoted to this single guy, huh? What do you think? Did you two sleep together? Our home is so small, where else could he sleep then? But we didn't have sex for quite a long time. You don't need it? We have married for decades, our passion faded. But two days before the accident, he strongly urged for that. It was a nice one! If I knew about the accident, I wouldn't have let him make it.. What do you used to call him? Fatty. I've already prepared the meal for you. You eat with Xiao-chuan, okay? I am going to attend a reunion with old classmates. Actually I don't want to go. We haven't seen for over 2 decades. The gathering means nothing! I don't think we'll have much to say. I am leaving. Wait. What's up? This looks better. No, that's too bare. Come on, it's okay. No way... It looks attractive. Pull it lower. But I am old! Okay, try it. Come on. These shoes are expensive! Don't spoil them. Anyway, they are no use to me now. Will it be a girl? He always wishes to have a daughter. Can you bear a 2nd child according to the government policy? My husband and I are from the minority nationality, so we can. What do you have in mind? So what can I do now? If you were me, at this age, will you give birth to this baby? Gorgeous! Look! I think it's too much. Try walking. Today, we have to thank Li's friend, Xiao-yi... to organize this gathering for us. Wish you good health. Doctor, so, will the scar be there forever? Can it be removed? The scar grows from your body. It's part of your body now. You said I'd recover from it. But how come it ends up like this? The sticks. Leave me alone. Ah... Ah... Didn't your dad teach you how to chase girls? Is he good at that? From the way he treated my mom, I haven't dreamt of seeking help from him. Actually, the best way of chasing girls, is to tell directly what you're thinking about her. Don't think that they will be embarrassed. They just pretend. They like it! Qing Qing. Qing Qing... I want to tell you something. I don't like you. You're the ugliest girl I have ever seen. You're too cheap! Xiao-chuan. I have to go now. The semester will start soon. So, see you then. And you... You know nothing. Da Zhi and I... We're over. He paid that a mount... for my laser eye surgery. Look, am I better looking now? Hi, Li, you're back. Go play mahjong. Go back home to prepare for dinner. Turn it down Turn it down, Okay? Where is the remote control? It's too hot. Feeling cooler now? I wish the sun sets now. Turn on the air-conditioner please. It's a waste of money. Can't afford it Xiao chuan, what are you doing? Why did your dad and I give birth to such a creep? Mom, dad died. You know that? He is dead. Ah... Mom... Ah... How dare you say that? I am sorry! Stop! I run after you. I told you to stop! Your dad is dead. You are being so ridiculous Where are you going? Come! Xiao-Chuan Come! Xiao-Chuan My dad wasn't treating me nice. He always punished me. He hit me for any reason. Sometimes, I got more serious hurt than this. Okay Xiao-yi. I need money. How much? Twenty thousand. Quiet... Quiet please. Come here please. Now, I declare that today... I declare that today... the choir formed by the old school mates is found now. The red little flowers blossom a long the river. I am falling love with a young man. But I can't tell him my true love. I just can't tell everything in my heart. I just can't tell everything in my heart. Get down Come on. What are they? So pretty. Wow! Look!

Well, I am leaving now. Where are you going? Wherever I can go. What will you do then? Whatever I can do. Please leave me your address. What for? Xiao-chuan's dad was insured. When his death is verified after two years, we can get the money. Then I can pay you back. You'd better drink less wine. Better give birth to the baby. Sir, may I serve you? Come on. What wine would you like to drink? Come here. Darling, please be tardy your flying wings. Beware of the thorny roses ahead. Darling, please open your lips.. Fragrant of flora will breeze you into paradise. Darling, please fly with me. Let's pass through forest to see the little brook. Darling, please dance your beautiful body. Sis, Sis, Sis, Let's leave this place together. I'll treat you like a princess. I'll work hard. I'll pay for your living. So you don't have to be a club girl. Anyway, I don't want you to work here. I've got an idea. We can leave together. We'll go to a beautiful place. In that place, no one knows us. We can start a new life there. Let's run a small restaurant there. I'll be the chef. And you'll manage the restaurant. We can stand on our own feet. We can earn money. Do you want to save me? Xiao-chuan. Try to give Su Dan this money. What? This is what I promised before. This is a compensation. She left for two years, where can we find her? I've got her address. Excuse me Check please. Okay. Thank you. Bill please. Okay. What's up? This is the eighth time I picked you. And this is the 8th time you throw up. Please drink less. How can I drink less? Sure you'll get a way. So tell me. There is always a solution. I just want you to know you must stop being so depressed keep going with your life. I just want someone to accompany with. I have ever thought I would fall in love with him. Your father is a good man. This thought never appears in his mind. Seriously? He truly just wants to help me. You want to know what happened in that morning? Do you still bear this matter in mind? I went into his taxi at 3:30am. The accident happened at five. What happened in that single hour? Stop drinking. You have to drive. It's okay for today. Alcohol gives me courage. After today, nothing is important. You can live in a beautiful scene, where has mountains and beaches. Nobody knows you. Then start your new life. Or running a small restaurant It's a way to earn money. And also feed your self. How happy that life is. Okay. Move. I'll push hard on the pedal, then the pipe will crack, and this taxi... it will rush forward in high speed. Are you okay? Don't worry. Just do it as what we have practiced. Remember that? Sure. We've practiced for many ti mes. Just do one more time as practice. Leave everything to me. Sure. Wait. Let's hear some music first. Darling, please be tardy your flying wings. Beware of the thorny roses a head. Darling, please open your lips. Fragrant of flora will breeze you into paradise. Darling, please fly with me. Let's pass through forest to see the little brook. Darling, please dance your beautiful body. The spring with love will never get sunset. We are flying so touchingly. We will never be alone in the world Xiao-chuan, are you okay? I am fine. Good. Maybe, I shouldn't have told you. I don't mind you telling me a story. But this is not rational at all. Only for this? why went for such a big set up? It's too risky. To get a perfect result, it needs a perfect design. I just don't believe it. The most ridiculous thing is, he just could finish it alone. Why did he take you along? It's just ridiculous. Anyway, This is not a true story. What do you think? Are you still thinking that... your dad is still alive? Darling, please dance your beautiful body. The spring with love will never get sunset. We are flying so touchingly. We will never be alone in the world Look! Sis. No! Just for once. Here. Once more. Once more. Mom, have you ever hidden something behind me? Sure. For something, kids shouldn't be told. Okay, From today, I have to hide something from you. Let's eat. What's up? I'll tell you when sister is 18 years old. Hey, you're always a kid. I am wondering what you're thinking of. What I want to know most is... when the taxi was falling into the river, whom my father was thinking of?
