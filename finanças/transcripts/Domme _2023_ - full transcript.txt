Yes, Ma? We're almost at the terminal. Don't bother sending the electric fan. They probably have air-conditioning there. Are you crying again? I know you miss me, but you should get used to it. You know what? Why don't you and dad have fun, and give me a brother instead? I also want a life outside Baguio, you know? We're approaching the terminal! We're approaching the terminal! - We're approaching the terminal! - I need to go, Ma. I'm about to get off the bus. Take care! Love you! Nice! How are you? Have you had dinner? Good evening! How are you? How was your trip? Have you settled in? The condo is really nice. Are you really sure that I'll be here for only 30 days? That's right. It's company policy. But, in case you have trouble finding a place to stay... Let us know, so we can help you. Sure! First thing tomorrow, I'll start looking for a place. Well, I think you're fortunate to be on your own! Usually, you have three to four roommates But, the two other recruits will be on-board next month. Both from Baguio. You have the whole place to yourself! So anyways, back to the topic! This is just a quick meeting. I'd just like to give some reminders. on important dates. I already received my training schedule too. Really? Good! Now we're talking! Just please do not forget the virtual orientation. One more thing. Is someone else there with you? No one's here but me. I'm all alone. It sounds like there's a fight going on? [loud thumping] [screaming] [thudding] It's coming from the other unit. Well, better talk to them, or report it to the admin. Your trainer should not hear this. Or worse! Your customers, during test calls in your training. - I understand. - Alright! I just have an urgent meeting tonight. So, I will just email you some details. And, if you have any questions, just ping me! Alright? - Okay. - Thank you! [yelling] [yelling] [yelling] [yelling] [yelling] [yelling] [yelling] [smacking, yelling] [man screaming] [screaming] [squeaking] [yelling] [yelling] [yelling] [yelling] [yelling] [yelling] [yelling] [yelling] [groaning] There's a monster in my bed. [screaming, thumping] [screaming intensifies] [thumping] [muffled screams] What's wrong with you? You dumbass! It's a couples thing. Don't get involved. Alright? Sir, your shoe laces are untied. Sir, is everything alright? Good morning, sir! What are you doing? I'm cleaning it. Do you know what kind of fish is that? No, Chef. Who told this imbecile to clean that fish? I did, Chef. Do you know what kind of fish this is? No, Chef. That fish's poison can take out the whole restaurant. Are you all aware of that? You need a license. To handle this kind of fish. That fish can poison everybody in this restaurant. That's why you need a license, before prepairing this kind of fish. [yelling] And I have that license! That's why I am your boss! There are certain preparations that only I can handle. I can even poison everyone here myself! If I wanted to. And that was my juggling act! You four imbeciles. Uncle. - That's enough. - Tony. Calm down please. Let's talk over there. Tell me. Tell you what? You won't just come here for no reason, right? So, stop wasting time and tell me what important matter brings you here? You got me. I sent you an email days ago. But... Obviously, you haven't read it yet. Uncle… I just have some questions about your finances. I see some big withdrawals and... I hope you kept the receipts for your purchases? Purchases? I had none! So… But… You withdraw ten thousand daily, right? All of it, within a week. I said no, right? No! But, who took all the money? Don't you understand? It's not me. If I may just remind you... I supported your education. Then gave you a decent job. As my accountant. Shouldn't I be the one asking questions here? And shouldn't you be the one giving me answers? Tony. Tony! Fix your shit! Yes, ma? I'm heading back to the condo. Don't worry. I can do it myself. Yes, I will. I promise if I need your help, I will call you. Okay? Bye. [sighs] That's why I got out of Baguio, to detach, but all I get is lots of calls. I'm sorry, miss. I know it's none of my business, but your constant fight with your husband is worrying me. If… If he's hurting you, and you need help, just knock on my unit. [yelling] [grunting] [yelling] [yelling] [yelling] [thudding] Hello! Can you please check on the noise from the other unit? Alright, thank you. Sir, please open up! [knocking continues] Yes? Good evening, ma'am. I'm from security. Just want to check if you are okay? And why would I wouldn't be? We got a call from a concerned tenant. Reporting loud noises coming from your unit. That seems to be fighting. Who ever that person is, thanks for their concern, but we're okay! Have you checked on the other units? I understand, ma'am. I apologize. If in case there's a problem, just call security. Again, I'm sorry, and good evening. Thank you, guard. [knocking] [knocking] [knocking] [banging] [banging] [banging] What the hell was that for? - Calling the guard? - What? Call the guard! And tell them a woman is inside your unit! It's your hobby, right? Meddling with other lives? I'm really sorry Miss. But it's too much! You’re bothering others. I don't want to witness a crime either. It creeps me out, you know? Hearing eerie grunts every night! You know, you'd make a good crime story writer! No one's going to get killed, unless you call the guards again! Joke! But... What are you really doing inside? I'll let you peek next time. Good morning, sir! Hello! Any update? Well, Sir… Next week! I'll make sure! What the fuck, Tony! How many weeks have passed? If I were you, I would pawn my car! So you can pay me! Sir, my uncle gave it to me. I just need timing, I'll borrow from my uncle and deposit it right away. What if I ask your uncle directly instead? Tony, I lent you money easily. But in return, you make me wait this long! Sir, I've been a good payer ever since. It's just that I had a string of losses. Then stop gambling, dumbass! If you can't pay until next week, you will surely regret it! I'll pay up. I'll surely enjoy re-arranging that face of yours. Ketchup. Uncle! What do you need? Well, is your phone turned off? I've been trying to call you. I even checked your condo. What condo? The one where you stay now. Try this. What's that? It's good! You think even Gordon would break a smile? What do you want now? Why are you here? Uncle, the truth is... I'd like to ask a favor. Another favor? What kind of favor? A piece of advice? A shoulder to cry on, or money? But, wait. What's the status of the missing money from my account? Well, Uncle, I'm still tracing it. So that means, I have nothing to give you. Now finish eating this. Then help with the dishes. So you can be useful. Bro! How are you? Hey! - How are you? - I'm good. How about you? Likewise. So, what have you've been up to? Nothing new really. Tell me, what do you need? Well... Actually... Where do I start? Can I borrow some money? How much? Five? Five... How much? Five hundred thousand? Five million. What? Are you serious? Come on... You have that, don't you? Yes, but... Bro! I wanna help you. Of course! But I'm not that liquidated yet. I can give you maybe... One million? One million? Don't get excited, I'll check first. Wait. Haven't you tried asking your Uncle? I did. - And? - He's become grumpy lately. He told me to trace out some missing funds. Which he obviously spent. But what if he didn't? Hey, I can track it for you. It's illegal, but... You know, I have access to everything. No, just forget about it. Look, if your uncle is not the one spending money... Then he needs a hero to save the day. That's where his only nephew comes in. So? You want to be the hero? You might get your inheritance this early as well! Send me your uncle's account details. Let me help you. Let me see what I can do. Bro! What about my one million? Let's enjoy first. Relax, bro. Alright. Waiter! Wecome to your day one! Voice and accent training. These are commonly mispronounced series. Repeat after me. Spokane. Spokane. Schenectady. Schenectady. Demoines. Demoines. Tucson. Tucson. [thudding] What's that? Did you hear that? Ma'am! I'm sorry! I think that's me. Our cat's been playing again on the roof. Alright, but minus ten points for talking in Tagalog. Let's continue! Boise. Boise. Chatanooga. Chatanooga. Very good! Let's take a break. Have some coffee, smoke, whatever! Just log in after 15 minutes, okay? Alright, next up to mock call. Cholo, are you ready? Ring, ring! Hello! Ring, ring! Hello! Ring, ring! Hello! Ring, ring! Hello! Ring, ring! Hello! Ring, ring! Hello! Ring, ring! Hello! Ring, ring! Hello! Next time, I'll let you take a peek. Ring, ring! Hello! Thank you for calling. Credit Americas, I'm Pocholo, can I have your account number? Sir, can you repeat it again? Miss… What the fuck? What are you doing? Guard! Guard! What’s the matter? Nothing. We’re friends, just playing around. Nothing’s wrong, sir. What are you really doing? - I don’t know- - Stop interfering. Leave me alone, okay? What if I tell this to the police instead? So you’re willing to report to the police when you’re the one who’s peeking through the window? You’re the one who should be reported! But what are you doing? And why? Sorry if I offended you. It’s just new to me. GMG. Google Mo Gago! (Just google it, idiot!) Please, miss… I just have one more question. Go ahead. Are you a prostitute? The fuck. And you still have the nerve to apologize?! Sorry again. Miss... Alright, come with me. What’s your name again? Cholo. Estelle. Nice, nice. About my question earlier… It’s okay if you don’t want to answer. What? If I’m a prostitute? What is your definition of a prostitute? Well, I guess... Someone who sells pleasure through their body? Aren’t we all? How about you? What’s your job? Call center agent. Isn’t it hard being a call center agent? Yes, especially in queing. So that also uses your body right? Does that mean you’re a prostitute? Does that mean, everybody who works should be called a prostitute? You’re being rude. What I mean is... It's having sex, And you get paid for it. Technically, I’m not having sex, because there’s no penetration involved. But there are some that reach orgasm when you hurt them, so does it count? You don’t do it with your customers? Well... I mean if they want to, or I want to, but… Most of the time, no. I’m a dominatrix. I perform bondage. - Dominance. - BDSM! Yes... But... I’d like to think of myself as a masseuse. Rather than to relieve their body pain, I am giving it to them! I’m your fairy godmother. Which do you prefer? A dog? Or cat? Dog! Is there a talking dog? Answer me! Bark! Arf! Arf! Arf! Sorry but, I still don’t get it. There are people who are... Numb. They are too desensitized. Or too rich, And powerful. Nobody can hurt them! So whenever I give them a beating... That’s it! They get aroused! Like that guy in the other unit. Raymond? His work demands dominance. Perfectionist. And, I’m his only escape from reality. Cheers. How are you, Cholo? Well... I’m okay. I'm adjusting, but... Overall, I’m okay. Okay. I see. That’s good! You’ve read the email I sent, right? Yes, ma’am. So what happened? It's just the second day of your training, and you didn’t return after lunch? Your trainer told me about it first I didn’t believed her, because when I interviewed you, I knew that you’re very responsible. Tell me what happened? I think my connection was intermittent, I am very sorry. She called you on the phone, but you weren’t answering. I didn’t noticed the call, I'm really sorry. Alright, if ever it happens again, inform your trainer and immediate manager right away. They were looking for you. I know you need some adjustments being in Manila. Youre in a great company. So, that's why, your main goal is to get regularized. Okay? Okay. Don’t get distracted, Cholo. Ma, I'm on a meeting! What’s the matter again? Yes Ma, I’m sorry. I’ll just call you later. Okay, bye. I wanted to cook your favorite dish. But I was in a hurry to catch the bus. I took the keycard downstairs. I told them, that I’m your wife. Then showed them our pictures on IG. I thought you didn’t want to come here with me. I really didn't want to. But, after our last fight, I realized that I missed you. Hey, I bought some korean food. Your favorite, right? There’s bibimbap, spicy kimchi, and fishcake. I already ate outside. I see. I'll leave tomorrow, if that's your worry. I have a scheduled flight for tomorrow. I just wanted to see you. Ah okay, good! You can put them on the fridge. I’ll eat them anytime. What about me? You can't put me on the fridge, right? But I want you to eat me... Now! Ada, I still have a training... Really now? - Are you Sir Tony? - Yes, that’s me. Are you the guy sent by the boss? Yes boss! He wants to give this to you. Here. [muffled yelling] Payment for your debt! Fool! Fuck you! Fuck! Flat white and one glass of ice. With ice? Ice! Fucking ice! - Sorry, sir. - Fuck! What? Stupid! Holy shit! What happened to you? It’s nothing. A minor accident on the highway. Took my car for repairs. About the five million I was borrowing, by the way... I only agreed to one million. Yeah, but can't I borrow five million? I'm sorry. I’ll transfer the one million to your account now, okay? I trust you. Because you're my frat brother. Just try and open your problems to your uncle. Get the right timing. Flatter him. His account is always full. If we're talking four million here, that's easy for him. How’s the investigation of his account? We’re tracing... Fuck it! Are you dumb? I didn't ask for water! I said just ice, right? Fucking idiot. Sorry bro, he's pissing me off. We’re tracing the money. There are... Multiple transfers of ten thousand mostly. Sometimes, there are small amounts. But the thing is... Get this. It only goes to one account. And then, after the transfer, It's withdrawn immediately. Nothing left. I'll have the ATM's CCTV checked. But it may take a while. The one with access will arrive next week. Anyway... Thank you. I’ll pay you back. Promise. Take care of yourself, bro. I got this. Tony, Tony, what’s this again? Just go with it. Are you kidding me? What occasion is this? Surprise! Are you surprising me because I’m going to die? No uncle, it’s for you to relax. At least we’ll be surrounded by good vibes, right? And we’re stressed lately. I don’t know if it’s because of the bad reviews, or about creating a new menu, so, I called some of your friends. Tony, that’s why you don’t succeed, it’s because you’re not doing anything right. Look at you, until now, you’re still dependent on me. Anyway, I want you to meet our partner for South East Asia. - Mr. Sahel Khan. - I'm Sahel Khan. - How do you do? - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I’ve heard so much about you. I’ll start up a restaurant in Japan, Singapore, and Dubai. I will help you. Thank you very much. I’ll handle the list of recipe. Don’t worry. Thank you. We’re so honored. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey Tony, who the fuck are these people? Uncle, they’re our cooks. Don’t tell me, they’re going to cook for my visitors? No, that’s not right. Boys, step aside. Excuse me. I’m going to cook for my visitors. So people, are you ready for the show? Yes! Yes? Sorry, wrong unit. Why? What unit are you looking for? Okay. Uncle. Yes Tony. Who knocked? A lady, she knocked on the wrong unit. Uncle, you’re not ordering girls right? Me? Ordering a girl? No. We’re cancelled today. He was surprised by his nephew. There’s a party at his condo. Well, I’ll bounce now. Thank you and goodbye. Do you want to hang out? Hang out? I mean, I have beer here. Would you like to drink? If it’s okay with you, and you’re not doing anything. Okay. Only one bottle, okay? Well, I only have cans though. Here. You’re not going to work? Where do you work again? Call center. But in-house, so I work from home. I don’t get it, but I’m not interested… So you’re going to work? I am, but I also don’t have to. Come on. Why are you answering like that? Aren’t you supposed to be good at communicating, because you work at call center? Yes, a part of it, but patience is more important. You shouldn't be weak-willed. Imagine, I’ve been in this industry for three years. I don’t care anymore if the customers curse, or shout at me. You’re just saying that. But if you have a chance, you would also be willing to shout at people. Which is harder because you’ll be able to pass your anger to other people. Even though they’re not doing anything wrong. Wow. Are you a psychologist? See, you’re deflecting the topic. What do you want me to say? Cholo, through my job, I’ve already learned a lot of things. Example. Your boss, police, politicians, your parents. You hate them because they have power over you. Most likely, you feel like you’re being abused. But that’s probably what you’re also going to do, if you’ll ever be in their shoes. You’re going to be an asshole too. Aren’t you doing the same? Just being an asshole too. For a non-prostitute, you have so many insights. Why? Just because I’m a prostitute, I should be dumb? That’s a misconception. You’re being offensive to the sex workers. Apologize to the prostitutes. Sorry, prostitutes. Cheers. Anyway, back to topic, if what you’re saying is true, I’ll never be like that. I’ll never abuse my power, if ever I land on that position. Maybe you’re just saying that because you haven’t experienced that yet, when you feel powerful and superior. You want to try. Free trial. What’s this? My mother’s gift from Baguio. I’ll open it. My mother told me it’s a goodluck charm. The reason I left Baguio was to get away from her. Turns out I still can’t escape. Why? Are you being abused? Broken family? What kind of life do you have? Nothing. Maybe that’s why I want to escape, because I’m being too pampered. You don’t have any problem, and yet you’re making one. If you want a thrill, jaywalk on Edsa. How did you become a domme? When I was in college, I needed extra money. I met a client, asking me if he could be my slave. I didn’t understand it. When I realized that there’s a high salary in dominatrix. I dropped out from college. I let go of Psychology. And then I studied art of BDSM. I don't talk about my work. Some people, if they find out it’s BDSM, it’s all about violence. Honestly, it’s a way of healing for some people. You’re letting out their trauma. You help them to own it. Own the narrative. You’re also a doctor, you treat their physical and emotional wounds. And the most important is, you’re a goddess in the eyes of your clients. For some of them, they stopped believing in higher power. They’re looking for an alternative in me. I punish them if they’re bad, and then if they’re okay, I give them a reward. So do your parents know? - Secret. - What the fuck. You’re a killjoy. No goddess reveals a secret. Cheers. Uncle. Uncle. What are you doing here? Don’t waste my time. Uncle, I know you already said no, but I need your help. There’s no one I could approach to. What? Money? How much? Five million. One big no! But uncle, hear me out. Tony, you won’t get anything from me. Find someone else. Hey bro, what's up? I have good news for you! We finally got the CCTV from the ATMs. Used to withdraw transfers from your Uncle's account. It's just one person, I'll send you an email right now. Got it, I'll check it out. Your uncle seems to have a woman. A woman? Either that, or he's being scammed by this bitch. Alright bro, I'll check it now. Thank you. She's familiar... [heavy knocking] Fuck you! Where's the girl!? Ha! Who are you? Fucker! You know her right? Who are you anyways? You wanna play this game? Where is she? Tell me! Fuck you! Come back here! You fuck! Who is that bitch? It's my uncle you're stealing from! That man next door? Why don't you ask him instead? Ask about his kinks! What? Dumb fuck! You're really clueless. Try asking him about his kink. What really turns him on! Go ask him yourself. It's not swindling, or robbing. It's called professional fee! Custom made for your uncle. You fuck. Stupid piece of… What? I met Raymond online. He had an alter account. He asked me if I accept… Findom. Ah, Kingdom… Findom, Silly! Financial Domination. Try searching it. In Twitter, or Instagram. F-I-N-D-O-M. Findom! "Pay your debts, Cashpigs!" The role of a mistress in FINDOM, is to create an imaginary loan. Like cashpigs, Human ATMs, Imaginary loans. But all payments are made in real money. But what's the point? Instead of dealing with physical pain, they opt for financial pain instead. That feeling of barely having enough money to get by. Get robbed. Sudden loss of finances. Is this for real? I had the same thought at first. Actiually, I still need to do some reasearch. To better understand Chremastistophilia. What? Ever heard of Kleptomania? It's the exact opposite! Some find satisfaction in being robbed. Those are really weird kinks. It's because we are poor. The rich and powerful. have full control. And sometimes, you get sick of it. You just let go of the money and all the power. Like most men with the same mindset. Which is work all day. Show off who has the biggest balls! Then after having all the money and influence. What's next? Why don't they just give to charity? Because it will make them look lenient. And weak-hearted. Which are no likeable traits in the character he wants to build. That's right. Search his stuff. But are you prepared to meet your real uncle? I'm no one's fool. Have you checked his room? You are. Answer me! You… Answer. You… Answer me! You… Seems you found what you're looking for. Potatos, peas... Garlic, all of that must be smiling, okay? So that the presentation would be a presentation. You know? Like this one. This one makes this potato smile. The peas... Where's the carrot? How can it smile? You know? Uncle! - What are you doing here? - Why haven't you left? You will regret this. You'll be the one with regrets, if you don't tell them to go outside. You don't want them to see this. Answer me! You… [groaning] - Answer me! - You are! All of you, outside, Now! Get out! Quickly, please! Get out! Faster! What else are you waiting for! Get out! Why are you showing me that? Turn that off! Shouldn't I be asking about this? Where'd you get it? And what would you get if you continue playing that? You spent your money on this? You liked that shit on your face? You're disgusting! And what do you think you'll get in return by doing this? Here, uncle. Sign this. And you'll have no problem. This video will not see the light of day. It shouldn't be seen. Especially by your business partners. So, what you actually want is for me to transfer all my assets to your name? Then we'll call it even? Is that what you want, nephew? Okay. Okay… Okay. Okay, you piece of shit! You think I will believe you? You can't even… Blackmail anyone succesfully! You can't even insult anyone. You’re a disgrace! You’re a failure! And you think you can scare me with this? Tell you what? Make a bunch of copies from this. And send it to all your friends in messenger. You piece of shit! Now take that paper and get out of my kitchen! You should have called me instead. And let me do the talking. He looked dangerous. See what he did to my face? I can handle myself. Why can't you just say 'Thank you'? What the fuck! Shit! Who's this? Good evening sir. It's Karen, Line Cook of Chef Raymond. What does he want now? Whatever it is, I'm not interested. But Sir, Chef has been kidnapped. - What? - The guard saw in the CCTV. Two men grabbed and took Chef Raymond. The guard was unable to catch up. What about the plate number? The vehicle used? It was a black car. I'll report this to the police. Do you think you deserve my punishment? Yes, Miss Estrelle. I deserve your punishment. Punish me! I'm a failure. I'm a loser. Punish me, Miss Estrelle. How's that? Want it tighter? Yes! Answer Me! Yes, tighter! Yeah. [groaning] [groaning] [groaning] How about this? Tighter? Give me an answer! Yes! Tighter? Yes! Answer Me! Yes! Huh? Answer me! Estelle, what happened? Raymond? Raymond. Answer me. Raymond. Raymond. Raymond. Wake up. Raymond. Raymond? Let's bring him to the hospital! Raymond. Raymond, wake up. Estelle, he's gone! Now I'm a suspect for this! Raymond?! - Raymond?! - You choked him to death! Raymond, answer me. Wake up please! Stay with me! Raymond! This never happened to me before! - Raymond?! - Estelle, he's dead! Let's go, Estelle! Come on, let's go! Are you sure this is your uncle's car? Yes! I'm very sure! By the way... That doesn't make any sense. What's it doing here? Why don't you stay here, And we'll check the area first. - Okay. - Let's go. What's he doing here? Cholo, let's just surrender. Please Estelle, just run away. No! I won't leave you here! Let's go… Hey! Hey! Someone's following us. - Maybe we should just surrender. - We won't do that! - Running away will put us in more danger. - No! it won't! Trust me, Raymond is still alive! Alive? He has no pulse and turned cold already remember? Stay calm. I got this, don't worry. Estelle, I don't want anymore trouble. Relax! We'll just do a little chat. Tell me your side of the story. Don't be scared. I'm your friend. Shall we begin? How did you… End up with the plan of murdering that wealthy chef? Would you like to... Share? You can speak, right? I see… You're gagged… We did not killed him. It was an accident. But eventually you did, right? Gave him beatings. You whipped him. Choke to suffocation. He wanted it! He wanted to be killed? Can I have an attorney? Relax! We all have that right. I'll give your request, but first, I need you to tell me what really happened. Because the other one, Had so much to say. And according to her, you instigated all of this. Cholo had nothing to do with this. This is my plan. So you admit it? She said you told her to run. But she said… She had everything covered. But that time, it didn't look that way. So you schemed all of this. And brought Cholo along? He called me. He was tired of everything, including his worthless nephew. He had high hopes for him. But his nephew betrayed him. Hello, Mistress. Sorry for this rush call. I have an offer. Do you accept, consensual, non-consent session? And what does consensual, non-consent mean? He agrees that I can do everything and anything to him. Anything I want. Because he trusts me. Including murder? You can do that? I consider him as very close friend. And I can't refuse him. But I will never have any reason to kill him. It was her first time. And maybe the last. Raymond's offer was hefty. With all my clients, and all the sessions I've been... There's always an agreement. On boundaries and how much control I have over them. This time, when I accept his offer, there are no more boundaries. What kind of result does he expect out of this? Don't your sessions not satisfy him anymore? He craves for more violence. Things I haven't done to him before. Like kidnapping. Electrocution. And he's offering a bigger amount. But I can't do it alone. I want you to come with me. I see. So you're saying that she just used you? To execute this crime. And you believed all of this... What? What do you mean by that? Well... If you think about it... She can do it on her own. She has access on all accounts. She can easily drain all of it. But why include you? And now you're in trouble. Because you are the scapegoat. You get all the blame. So, just admit to it. You've tortured my uncle enough. Why did you have to kill him? Your uncle was right. You’re a failure! What did you say? You're a failure! He died of disappointment because of you. He blames himself. For what you have become! Ma'am, take it easy. Fuck you! That's enough. He was awake, Tony! He was aware when you tried to kill him! Ma'am, that's enough. Let go of me! Let's go. How are you? Hey! Can you be honest with me? Did you just use me? What are you talking about? Does killing Raymond the plan all along? Are you alright? I was thinking… Maybe the officer was right. You set me up. Since when were cops right? Think about it. After his death... You'll blame me. And you go free. With all the money. If that's what you think of me, then fuck you! You’re the only one I trust! If that's what you believe. then so be it! The chief wants to see you both. I'm sorry chief, but what are these killers doing here? There's been an interesting turn of events. Are you both settled? Okay. Here's the autopsy report. It's poisoning. That is the cause of the victim's death. What? Poison? He was still fine, when I took him inside. When you kidnapped him! Stop it! I'm telling you. Not in here! Or you'll end up behind bars. As I was saying, it's very interesting. This the first time I've seen this. Ricin. It is a slow acting poison. Which the victim used. He probably took it. Two or three days ago. What foolishness is this? We saw this also in the victim's unit. Hi! Hello, to whoever sees this. I'm sure by that time, I'm long gone. Why? And why not? All my life, I was trained to be successful, to leave a good legacy. Get rich and everything… And so I did! But something is still missing, I'm searching for something that's not there. Something I can't have. Throughout my search, All I found was pain and more emptiness. But that will all be over soon. Things will all go back to normal. Because I've decided to leave this world. And maybe, when I leave this world, I'll be able to find there what is missing here. Farewell… Thank you… Goodbye… What's wrong? Looks like I've been promoted. Promoted? Promoted to suspension. They want me to explain my absence. Then tell them you went to jail. For assisting a BDSM session that went wrong. Maybe later, I'm not in the mood. Is that so? Yet you make me, when it comes to my life. I thought you came to Manila, just for a breather. Because you're bored there. I'm not sure of my future here anymore. Where's your province, by the way? Would you take secret for an answer? Of course not! Alright, Marinduque. Ma, I'm sorry but I can't come home this month. But next month, I promise. My workmates are great, and we have a good manager. I have to go, I have things to do. Take care, okay? I love you. Blue is my favorite color. I'm the eldest of three children. My favorite dish is eggplant omelette. My favorite tree is Ipil-ipil. Since, it's the last time we'll be seeing each other, my real name is Marie. Remembrance… Thanks. But… How did you come up with Estelle? Secret… I'm a failure. I failed my uncle. I'm a failure. Are you ashamed of what you did? Yes mistress! I am! You regret what you did to your uncle? Yes! Louder! I am ashamed of what I did! And to our family! Open your mouth! Holy shit. Where do you get the strength to go out of your house? Did you also eat your helper's meal? Yes, master. Even your driver won't hookup with you, because you're ugly! Are you a pig? Yes, master. My question is... Are you a pig? Oink, oink! Oink, oink! Oink, oink! Do you want me to shove this in your mouth? - Yes, master. - Do you? Yes, master! Oink, oink!
