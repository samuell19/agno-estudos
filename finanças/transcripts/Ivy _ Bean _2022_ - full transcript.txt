[light whimsical music playing] [dreamy music playing] [dreamy music rising] [light whimsical music playing] [whimsical music rising] [whimsical music fading] [grunts] - [kids playing in distance] - [dog barking in distance] [bright music playing] [grunts] [kids yelling in distance] [grunts] [Travis] What are you doing, Bean? I'm making the Pit of Doom. It's a deadly trap for catching really dangerous things. Wanna help? It'll be fun. We just want the dirt. Lots and lots of dirt. [sighs] Fine, take some. But not too much. I know how you guys work. [mischievous music playing] [both chuckle] [shovel scraping] [light mysterious music playing] "Pinch of lilac." [mystical music playing] "Strand of hair dark as night." "Toe of dead frog?" Maybe I don't need that. [curious music creeping in] Clear as water. Light as air. Circle three times. The first with care. [Katrine] Ivy! I'm starting breakfast. Coming! Though you won't see me. Three steps forward. Fourth, if you dare. Look straight to the glass. You will not be there. [unsettling music playing] [gasps] [magical music playing] Yes! Yes! Invisibility is mine! [whimsical music playing] [Ivy] Wondrous! [knock on door] Hey. Pancakes sound good, or is it more of a waffles-for-the-weekend thing? You can see me? Yes. Is that the right answer? I guess I do need a frog. [kids playing in distance] [bike bell rings] [kids laughing in distance] [Travis] Bean's pit isn't gonna catch anything. [Trevor] Yeah, trapping pits are normally rectangular. - [Travis] Yeah. - [Trevor] Yeah. [Travis] Bean should stick to sandcastles. [Trevor] Yeah. - [Nancy] Hey, Bean-breath! - [Bean gasps] Breakfast! Come in. [playful music playing] Like, now. Mom said. [Bean] Here's your breakfast! Ew, ew! Get those worms away. Wanna help make the Pit of Doom? It's gonna be awesomer than that cave we made. I do not play make-believe in the dirt anymore. Well, you do play make-believe that you're a grown-up. [grunts angrily] [Bean] Just because you're 12 doesn't make you the boss of me, Nancy. [Nancy grumbles] - [Nancy] Little sisters are so annoying! - [Bean scoffs, grunts] [boy] Over here. [kids laughing] [machine buzzing] Leo! You have to come over after breakfast! We have to finish the Pit of Doom today, okay? - [buzzing continues] - What? [sighs] I said you have to come over after breakfast and finish the... [Bean grunts] [ominous music playing] [gasps] Bernice Blue. Sorry, Mrs. Trantz. It was an accident. Accidents are what happen when little children don't behave. [loud whirring] [dog barking] [gasps] Dottsy! Do not let Bernice Blue interrupt your tinkle time. Oh-hoo-hoo! You did it! Ooh! It's a good one too. Ooh! Aw. Yeah. [inhales sharply] We don't like children. Do we, Dottsy? [gasps] We don't because they're yucky and mucky and icky, icky, icky. [groans] [shivers] All right, my baby. Okay, let's do this. - [leaf blower whirring] - [Dottsy whines] [grim music playing] [Mrs. Trantz] Just remember, I have your mother's phone number. [bird hooting] [intriguing music playing] [Charlotte] Bean! Breakfast! [Bean sighs] [Charlotte] I have to take the girls shopping later. Wanna come? [David] La, la, la. Were you saying something? [Charlotte] Do you want to take the girls shopping? [David] Sorry, I can't hear you, so I probably can't help. La, la, la, la. Mom, there's a place that does ear-piercing right by where we're shopping today. [dismissive laugh] Not happening. If Mrs. Trantz calls, it was an accident. Again, Bean? - [phone ringing] - [sighs] Hey, Dad, Leo and me are going to finish the Pit of Doom today. - [ringing continues] - "Leo and I." Subject pronoun. Oh! Hello, Mrs. Trantz. [Mrs. Trantz on phone] She is out of control. Do you mean my pit? The one I was digging for the tree? Yes! It's in case any bears or bad guys come into our yard. They'll fall in and be trapped. You actually think you're gonna catch a bear? And then what? I could train her and take her to this week's show-and-tell. Well, if I were you, I'd be sure to consider the standing height of your average grizzly. So you know how deep to dig the pit. [growls] [roars] [snarls] [growls] No. [David growling] [both snarling, growling] - [both laughing] - [Bean] Yay! [pop music blasts on radio] [David] Oh, yeah! [on radio] ♪ What I like... ♪ Yes, Bean does get distracted. [pop music blasting] - I don't know where she gets it from. - [David] Yeah! Come on, Nancy. Show us how it's done. [Bean] Nancy? That's our rule. We hear the music, and we have to dance. [David singing] ♪ Whispering in my ear... ♪ [music stops] - [David groans] - [sighs] Grow up. The rules have changed. [tense music playing] [dark musical sting] Remember? [Nancy] You signed it. [dark music playing] [sighs] [Charlotte] Your mother never let you? Really? [Mrs. Trantz] My mother would never have... [Nancy] Be kind. Tell the truth. Listen to others. No name-calling, and no playing tricks. Mm-hmm. - [loud slurping] - And no slurping your cereal. [spurts] [Nancy gasps] No being gross on purpose. Sometimes being gross on purpose is useful. Hmm... You know that if you break three rules in one day, that's it. Serious consequences. [burps] Ew! You... are infuriating! - [Charlotte] Yes. Yes. Bye. - Oh, hey, Bean. Bean. Bean. - [David] Try to stay clean today because... - [sighs] You and I are taking Nancy shopping in a bit for school clothes. - You might wanna get something too. - [Bean shouting] No! [Bean's shout echoing] [mischievous music playing] Yes, that's your child. [quirky music playing] Any plans for today? [sighs] I'll be here doing research. I need to find a frog. Oh, like one for a pet? More like one that's old and getting ready to donate his body to science and/or magic. Oh. [frog croaks] Oh, I'd love to donate my body to magic. Well, um, frogs, I hear, are found outside. So come and get some fresh air. Outside. [kids shouting outside] You know, that girl across the street, she seems nice. Wouldn't you wanna join them? Make a new friend? - [kids yelling outside] - Bean? Mm-hmm. [yelling continues] No thanks. [chuckles] What's wrong with Bean? She just runs around and makes noise. Well, why do you say that? - [Bean] I can make more noise than you! - [indistinct shouting] Okay. But, you know, you don't even really know her yet. [sighs] Who knows? You might change your mind. I won't change my mind. [sighs deeply] One thing I do know about Bean is she has no imagination. I tiptoed up to the edge of the Pit of Doom, and there was this kind of snuffling sound below. At first, I thought it was Leo with a bad cold, but when I looked in... - [mystical music playing] - [inhales] [exhales sharply] There it was. - [snarling] - [kids] Wow! [kids clapping, cheering] [boy] It's humongous! That's not gonna happen, Bean. The only thing that's going to fall in this pit is you. - [Bean grunts] - Hey! Watch the cleats. I have a game this afternoon. Why would you want to play something you have to stay clean for? I like the uniform. [Bean grunts] [hose squeaking] [screaming] [Bean shrieking] [both screaming] [Bean] I'm gonna get you! [metal clanking] [Mrs. Trantz] A perfect neighborhood is one without leaves or children. Isn't that right, Dottsy? [chuckles] [Dottsy barking] [suspenseful music playing] [Dottsy barking] Hey, babe. - Oh, thank you. - Uh-huh. [smooching] [boy] Okay, Dad! [kids playing in distance] Remember when it felt that easy? [kids yelling in distance] Everything was so... under control. You mean, back when we had just one kid? - Mm. - [laughs] It was nice. - Now, two kids. - Mm. - Double the learning experience. - [Charlotte chuckles] - [slurping] - [laughing] - Yeah, well... - [kids laugh in distance] What do you think we'll be learning about today? [Bean] I'm gonna get you! - Get away from me! - [Charlotte and David scream] - [Charlotte] Bean! - [Leo] Get away from me! Just wanna wash your uniform for you! [Bean grunts, groans] - [sprinkling] - [Dottsy barking] - No! No! [yelps] - [Dottsy barking] [Mrs. Trantz screaming] [Mrs. Trantz thuds, grunts] [kids gasping] - [gasps] - [both] Ooh! [inhales sharply] [foreboding music playing] [whimpers] Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. You! You! You! [Ivy laughing in distance] [Ivy continues laughing] [dark music playing] [mischievous music playing] Hmph! [David] Mrs. Trantz? - Oh! I... - I can help you. All right, handsy! - Dottsy! Come back to mama. - [Dottsy barking] [Mrs. Trantz] Ow, ow, ow! Don't trip. - [Dottsy whines] - Ow, ow! Dottsy! You and I have different interpretations of clean. I am clean, mostly. - [bike bell rings] - The water just washed off all the dirt. Mine. [sighs] - [door opens] - [Nancy] Mom! I'm ready. Bean, as a favor to me and my sanity, go inside, take a shower, and put on something clean. Please don't make me go, Mom. - Shopping sucks my bones. - [sighs] [woman grunting] [woman exhales sharply] [Nancy] Mom, I think red makes my eyes pop. [Charlotte] What color says, "I value my education"? Bean, don't lie on the floor. Please, can we leave? This is taking forever. What do you think? I think it's gonna be night soon, which means burglars and bears. [quirky music playing] [bear huffing] Bean, get off the floor. Please, I wanna get home and dig the pit before it's too late. It's hard, and nobody's helping. I have an idea. Why don't you ask the new girl? - Ivy? - [Charlotte] Yes. She seems nice. Nice is boring. She wears headbands. Why do you think Ivy's boring? Because she is. All she does is read. At recess, Mom. She reads at recess. Well, Ivy just moved here, Bean. She probably doesn't have friends yet. I think I'll get it. [Charlotte] Hmm. I think this hem's a little short. [woman grunting] [woman] Okay. Right here. What? What is this? Okay. [grunting, screaming] - [gasping] - [woman whimpers] - Bean, what are you doing? - Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. [sighs] - Mom? - Hmm? It's kinda expensive. Am I getting extra clothes allowance? Now that I'm not a kid anymore. Oh, for the love of Betsy, just get the dang skirt! Don't be such a tightwad. What did you call me? Where on Earth did you hear that? Grandma. Who's Betsy? It's just an expression. Calling someone a tightwad is rude, Bean. Apologize to Nancy, please. Yeah. Apologize. [sighs] [in sing-song] I'm sorry you're such a tightwad. Bernice Blue, can you behave for ten minutes? - Please. - [sighs] Hmm. Wouldn't pierced ears look great with my hair like this? Nice try. [upbeat percussive music playing] [whoopee cushion farting] [playful music playing] [squeaking] [gasps] [Bean] Let's trick the tightwad. [birds chirping] [leaves rustling in a distance] [door opening] [Bean] Come on, Nancy. Take the bait. [foreboding music playing] [reeling] [Nancy] Very funny, Bean. [Bean] I am not Bean. I am the ghost of Mr. Killop. I can see your pants. [Bean] I lived in this house until I died of bad breath and busted boils. So I haunt the bush in front of it. Get out of there, Bean. [Bean] Stay away! Or in the dark of night, icy fingers will wrap around your neck. Ow! Help! Ow! Ow! Let go! [groans] My tiny delicate bone. You broke my arm. I did not. [moaning] You okay? - [Bean groaning] - I didn't mean to. [Bean] Fooled ya! Silly big sister! [in sing-song] Nah, nah, nah, nah. I got you! [chuckles] Nope. I got you. You know the rules. Three strikes, you're out. I didn't break three rules. You called me a tightwad. That breaks rule one. "Be kind." Two, you tried to trick me with fake money. "No playing tricks." Three, you just lied about your arm being broken. "No lying." There's four. You wiggled your butt. And five and six. But it doesn't even matter because you're already gonna face serious consequences. Hmm. Oh, yeah? See if I care. And I'm not getting consequences in my face because I'm running away. Mom! - Mom! - [huffs] - Mom! - And you'll never ever find me! Not even if you hire a detective. - [Charlotte] What? What? What? - [gasps] [chuckles] I don't know. And she was reeling it into the bush, and then I pulled her out, and she turned around, and she wiggled her butt at me... Psst! [whispers] Follow me. Come to my backyard. If you dare. The coast is clear. But from here on in, you have to put on this. Why? Because it's a secret passageway. [mischievous music playing] [Ivy whispers] No peeking. [birds chirping] Do everything I say so you won't get hurt. [mischievous music playing] - Run! - [Bean yelps] [frantic music playing] [music stops] You can look now. [birds chirping] Ta-da! You've run away. [wondrous music playing] [wings fluttering] Whoa! [twittering] - [Ivy] Persephone, say hello to Bean. - [Persephone] Bonjour, Bean. [gasps] It's my secret garden. Did you read that book? [sighs] I'll bring lots of food and blankets. I'm only running away until dinner. [sighs] What's the puddle for? It's not a puddle. It's a pond. A frog pond. A pond for a guppy maybe. If I was a frog, I don't think I'd want to live there. But would you wanna die there? [Bean] Wouldn't you get in trouble if your mom found out I was hiding here, and it was your idea? No. I forgot, kids like you don't get in trouble. I do too! For what? Reading books? You can't get in trouble for reading. I will get in trouble, huge trouble. If I do what I wanna do. What's that? Spells, magic, potions. Hang on. Are you some kind of... witch? [mischievous music playing] [Bean gasps] - You are a witch! - A witch in training. Although Grandma tells me that I probably know more than some born witches. This is so organized. I made it so there's separate places for toys, potions, reading, sleeping, and dress-up. Oh, and this is my doll collection. Meet Ellie and Esmerelda. Periwinkle. Quite the gossip. Lilith. Dorothy. Pavlova. And this is Annie and Sophie. Is this a mummy? I'm gonna build a pyramid to bury her in. Nice! So, what spells can you do? I just learned the spell that makes you dance forever. And I'm working on a spell that makes you invisible. Let's do it, right now! I would, except I need a dead frog. It'd be mean to kill a frog. That's why I'm building a pond. So, a frog will move in and die of old age. That's pretty smart. This part is really secret. [mysterious music playing] [Ivy] My witch's robe. Hmm? Whoa, Nelly! [Ivy] Watch this. [clicks] It's my spell book. This is so amazing. Where did you get this? My grandma sent it to me. Is she a witch-in-training too? She says that she isn't, but I have my doubts. Hmm. And... my magic wand! That's just a stick It's a wand. And you better watch out, or I'll use it on you. I'll make you dance forever! [sighs] [dull music playing] [gasps] You just gave me the best idea. Let's do the spell on Nancy. She deserves it for being such a booger-head. So, a spell would be perfect. Especially, if we made you look like a real witch. I am a real witch. No offense, but you don't look it. [sighs] [Bean] Do you have any face paint, fake blood, glue, maybe some scissors? [adventurous music playing] [exhales sharply] [suspenseful music rising] - [birds chirping] - [dog barking in distance] [dreamy music playing] Um, Bean never came in. Do you know where she is? I told you, she ran away from home. Could you go find her, please? Are those mine? [Nancy] Why? What is the point? You're not even gonna punish her. She'll be cleaning her room all afternoon. Now go find your sister. [trinkets clinking] Fine. I wouldn't wear these anyway. Hmm. - Did you make them or something? - No. I didn't make them. I made them. [quirky music playing] [groans angrily] [laughing] [sighs] Just remember what we'll be saying in another 15 years. Fifteen years, we'll be basking somewhere - on a wonderful beach, alone. - Ooh, I like that idea. - Oh, my gosh. - Margaritas. ♪ We'll be alone ♪ [both] ♪ No babies, no kids ♪ - ♪ It's happy ♪ - ♪ All happy ♪ - ♪ It's optimal ♪ - ♪ We're good ♪ [both] ♪ No babies in the house no more ♪ ♪ No babies in the house no more ♪ - ♪ No kids, no babies ♪ - ♪ I know, baby ♪ - You hungry, baby? - ♪ No babies ♪ [bright music playing] You were right. I do look amazing. [sighs] You're going to scare Nancy to death. - [Nancy] Hey, Bean-breath! - [Bean gasps] Stop running away this minute, Bean! Mom wants you home! Now! How soon can we do the spell? Right away. Just need... worms. [chuckling] Worms? No problem. [mischievous music playing] [Bean] Let's go get my trowel. We're on a worm mission. Oh, yeah. Let's do this. - Whoa. - Oh! Hello. [laughs] Would that be my eye shadow? And my trowel? [sighs] Yup! Hi! I'm Bean. - From across the street. - [Katrine] I know. Hi, it's nice to meet you. I'm Ivy's mom, Katrine. So, when did you two start playing? We're not playing. We're on a mission. Oh, what a nice idea. Have fun. Yes! [Ivy] Why do moms always say "nice?" Nice is boring. I'm glad you're not nice. I'm glad you're not nice too. [Nancy] Bean! This is the final warning bozo-face. Mom wants you in... here now! [gasps] [Nancy] Bean, you're in so much trouble. We can't go that way. We have to get the worms for the spell before Nancy sees us. [Nancy] Come home now! - But there's no way out there. - [Nancy] Bean? [mischievous music playing] You like secret passageways. Well, this is top secret. No one will see this passageway to my house. Really? Mm-hmm. [wondrous music playing] [Bean] There are 12 houses in Pancake Court, and I have discovered a secret passageway through all of them. Follow me, and we can get from your backyard to the Pit of Doom undetected. There we will get the worms, sneak up on Nancy, and do the spell. Follow me. [thrilling music playing] [tinkling music playing] [flies buzzing] [Bean grunting] [Ivy grunting] This is Poopy Yard. [panting] I call it no-man's land. [flies buzzing] [foreboding music playing] [siren wailing] - [blasting] - [siren wailing continues] [blasting continues] [helicopter hovering] [thrilling music playing] [Ivy] Sergeant Bean, there are mines ahead. How do we proceed? We have to move fast. Step exactly where I step. [blasts] [adventurous music playing] [flies buzzing] [splats] Ugh! [Bean] I've been hit! Ugh! Soldier down! [Bean grunting] [groaning] [Ivy] Stay with me, Bean. Stay with me. [slurping] - [adventurous music continues] - [chalk scribbling] [curious music playing] [Bean] This is enemy territory. Stay sharp. Um... Easy. [Bean] We got this. [Ivy grunting] [both] Whoa! [both grunt] [Beam groaning] [ominous music playing] [Ivy] Who lives here? Who's the worst possible person who could live here? [spritzing] [foreboding music playing] [whispers] An ogre! They're the worst possible. They're dangerously aggressive and territorial. And they eat children. - [crow caws] - [Mrs. Trantz laughs] Tidbits, tidbits, yummy, tasty tidbits. Oh! Look at what's cooking in my pot. - [Dottsy growls] - Dottsy, we're going to eat well tonight. [cackles] - [gasps] Little girl soup. Mmm... - [Dottsy barks] [both in unison] I don't like being soup. We better keep moving before she sees us. The way out is behind that statue. [thrilling music playing] Ooh! [gasps] Bean. [nonchalant humming] - [yelps] - [clanking] [Bean whimpers] [barking] Bean! Do the invisibility spell! - You've got the frog. Do the spell. - [Dottsy barking] Hurry! She's going to see us! - [Ivy] I need lilac! Lilac! - Hurry. Hurry! [Bean] Oh, Dottsy. Don't eat the frog. You two. You stay right there. Right there. [sighs] We had a frog. [Mrs. Trantz] Bernice Blue. Who else could it be except for... you. Whatever you are. I'm Ivy, I live over... Well, "Ivy," do you know anything about trespassing? Your friend Bernice does not seem to. Sorry, it was an emergency. Hmm. I don't think you're sorry at all. Though you will be because there are consequences for coming uninvited into other people's yards. [sniffing] Oh! - Ew, ew! Poo on you. - [Bean groans] [Mrs. Trantz] I feel sick. I think I might throw up. [gagging] Yes, that's the emergency I was telling you about. Mm... Hmm. Nice try. [gags] - [groans] - [retching] You... [groans] both come in the house while I call... [groans] [retching] [gagging] Mm-mm. Mm. [retching] [grunting] Don't you dare. [gagging] [retching] [gags] Go! Run! Out of my yard! Now! [Bean] That's what we were doing! [burps, huffs] Dottsy! - [Ivy sighs] - Ivy, that was awesome. [burping] [chuckles] [combat music playing] [mysterious music playing] [Bean grunting] [Bean] Be wary. Sometimes allies, sometimes foes. [Ivy grunting] Wow! [wondrous music playing] Do you also build pyramids? Did you take all of my dirt? You can't have all of it. [sighs] It is pretty nice. Homeschooled. [Ivy] Lucky. This is Ivy, by the way. Ivy, this is Travis and Trevor. They're twins. But it's important that you respond to us as individuals. Hi, Travis. Hi, Trevor. [both in unison] Hey there, Ivy. - Bye, Travis. Bye, Trevor. - Bye, Travis. Bye, Trevor. - [Travis] Bye. - [Trevor] Bye. As soon as you go through, watch out for the Pit of Doom. And crawl along the fence to the playhouse, so we can figure out whether it's safe or not to get the worms. Nancy might be watching, so stay low. And yes, we do build pyramids. Did you want one with smooth sides or with steps? [Ivy] Steps, please. [intriguing music playing] [Bean] There's the pit. There's the playhouse. [dog barking in distance] [mischievous music playing] [kids playing in distance] [Nancy] I've looked everywhere, Mom! Bean's vanished. [combat music rising] [Bean grunts] Bean? Mm-hmm. [grunts] [Bean grunting in distance] [Bean pants] [exhales sharply] So, the first thing we do is get the worms, then figure out a way to creep up on Nancy. Here's the spell. "Dance Everlasting." "Dance and squiggle, worm a-wiggle..." Just say the magic words and throw the worms. It's pretty simple. Okay, so how many worms, exactly? [Ivy murmuring] Twenty worms, exactly. Dottsy? Dottsy! Dot... [foreboding music playing] [exhales sharply] Huh! I just saw worms here. This is a worm place. [groans] Speak to us, oh, wiggly worms. Reveal where you are hiding. [enchanting music playing] Try there. [soft whimsical music playing] [Bean gasps] - Ivy, you're a worm whisperer. - [chuckles] Did I ever mention how much Nancy hates worms? I love them. They're so wet and slimy, and they can regenerate parts of their bodies. - [David] And we got lots of tomatoes... - [gasps] ...corn, zucchini. Dad's coming. Hide in the jungle! [low grim music playing] [jungle music playing] [Bean and Ivy grunting] - [birds calling] - [Bean grunts] [grunting] - [birds calling] - [wings fluttering] - [hissing] - [gasps] A viper! A cobra! A viper cobra. [both grunting] [both gasp] [in unison] The most dangerous kind! [percussive music playing] [Bean] Hurry! [both panting] [David] Over here, I'd try to plant something new. And this year was corn and... [Katrine] Oh, yum. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'd be surprised at how quickly they grow. And... here we are. [grim music playing] Uh... Raccoons? Maybe. Or bears. I've heard tell there's a grizzly problem out here. What's my mom doing here? My dad invites everyone over for vegetables. My mom says that he has a green thumb. But I've checked a bunch of times, and it looks normal to me. ...aspect of life. I don't make the rules. - [whispering] Can they see us? - No way. I don't know why kids have to run through the garden. [Katrine] That is way more fun than running through the yard. [whispers] Guess what? I just thought of how we can sneak up on Nancy. [mischievous music playing] [Bean grunts] [kids grunting] [chuckles] [both grunting] [mischievous music playing] [both grunting] Stay out of my string beans, bears, or be ready to face show-and-tell. [grunting, panting] [both chuckling] [grunting, panting] [both panting] [Katrine] They really think we can't see them. [inaudible] Danger ahead. Follow me. [birds chirping] Do not understand. Move like a shadow. Move like a ghost. Move like a ninja. [suspenseful music playing] Understood. [Bean chuckles] [Bean gasps] [creaking] [whispers] Dottsy? [grunts] Dottsy! Dottsy? [playful music playing] You should probably take some tomatoes, too. - That'd be so great. - Excuse me. Have you seen my Dottsy? He's having a moment in my tomatoes. - [whines] - [Mrs. Trantz] Oh! Dottsy, did you chase those bad little girls? - Have you met Mrs. Trantz? - [Mrs. Trantz babbling] - No, not yet. But, um... - She's very... - She seems interesting. - Uh, ye-yeah, interesting. [birds chirping] [mischievous music playing] [Nancy crying] [bawling] [Nancy sobbing] [Nancy whimpering] That's not fake crying. That's real crying. That's so weird. Nancy never cries. Maybe she's sad because you ran away, and it's all her fault. [sighs] Maybe she's sorry for being mean. And for never playing with me anymore. I bet she wishes she was a better sister. Now she just sits by the window waiting for your return. I wouldn't mind a sister like that. Oh! I must go! - [thunder crashing] - [sobs] Bean is out there! Somewhere! I must find her and bring her home! [sobs] - Nancy. - [Nancy] Don't try and stop me! It's all my fault! We agree. It is your fault. You should search for the rest of your life to find your sweet... [bawling] ...and kind and adorable little sister. [all] Bean! [sighs] Maybe we shouldn't do the spell. [sighs] It's probably not fun to dance forever. And not stop until your feet are bloody stumps. - [Nancy bawling] - [Bean sighs] [pensive music playing] [sniffles] It's so not fair, Mom. Everyone but me has them. Everyone. Even some of Bean's stupid friends. We've discussed this a million times, Nancy. You'll get them when you're 13. [bawling] She's not crying about me. She's crying about having her ears pierced. You're a booger-head! You know that? Booger-heads don't wear earrings! Booger-heads just wear boogers! [dramatic music playing] [huffs] Mom! [huffs] I found Bean! [Bean grunts] You are so busted! [grunting] Stop! I command you to leave Bean alone! I hope you're ready to dance forever! Until the day you die! Do the spell. [chuckles] Is that a magic wand? It is your doom. [chuckling] Are you pretending to be some sort of... witch? She is a witch. A witch-in-training. "Dance and squiggle, worm a-wiggle, long as you live, you'll always jiggle!" [in mocking tone] Oh, no! [scoffs] You're doing a spell. I'm so scared. Stop making fun of my friend. [Nancy] Your friend? I thought you said she's the boring girl who wears headbands and reads at recess. [huffs] [tense music playing] Prepare to dance forever! [screams] What? No! Stop it! Get them off of me! Get them off! [Nancy whimpering] Oh! Get them off! [mischievous music playing] [chuckles] She's... dancing! [Nancy whimpers] [music stops] [exhales sharply] [Bean] Oh no. I'm out of worms. [huffing] - [snarls] - [Bean] Uh... Run! - [Nancy growling] - [Bean and Ivy scream] I am going to kill you! Huh? Uh... [panting] [grunting] [screams, grunts] [both gasping] - [David] Nancy! Sweetie. - [panting] Ooh. - [growling] - [Bean gasping] [frantic grunting] [Bean] She's still dancing. The spell worked! - [barking] - Dottsy, no. Stay away from those terrible children. [Mrs. Trantz yelps] [Mrs. Trantz screams] [Nancy yelps, grunts] [Mrs. Trantz groans] Oh. Oh, oh. [Mrs. Trantz] Get me out of this pit! [Mrs. Trantz and Nancy groaning] [fantastical music playing] [Trevor] Look! Bean's pit did catch something. [Mrs. Trantz and Nancy crying] [David] Honey, are you okay? [Nancy and Mrs. Trantz sobbing] [barking] [Nancy and Mrs. Trantz bawling] [fantastical music playing] [Nancy] I don't like dirt! [music fading out] No dessert and no TV for a week? If that's what consequences are, it's not too, too bad. I don't think your mom was that mad. Mom, help. [crying] [Charlotte] Nancy, come on. Baby, come on. - [Charlotte chuckling] - [Nancy crying] - Get up. - [Nancy bawling] And Dad didn't seem too mad either. Upsidaisy. You've had quite the day. - [Mrs. Trantz groans] - All right. Yeah, just give me a little boost here. [Mrs. Trantz cries] Use your legs. Yeah, use your legs. There you go. I knew the pit would catch something, but how come Nancy stopped dancing? Isn't it a forever spell? Yeah, but we didn't have 20 worms, so it only half worked. [sighs] We'll have to do it again. What if we do the dancing spell on Mrs. Trantz? We can do it on the people who keep the dog in the Poopy Yard. Imagine if they had to dance forever around poop! [both laugh] Excuse me, but your plans for tomorrow may not include spells on neighbors, terrorizing your sister, dog poop, worms, or Pits of Doom. Is that clear? It's almost time for supper. Do you wanna walk Ivy home? - Yes! - [Charlotte chuckles] [tranquil music playing] [Bean] You know what's so weird? I did use to think you were boring. [Ivy] I thought you were boring. I thought all you ever did was read. I thought all you ever did was run around making noise. [Bean chuckles] Do you really not like headbands? Mm. - [clicks] - [Bean gasps] No way! Are you sure? I'm sure. [chuckles] See you tomorrow? And the day after that. And the day after that. Bye, Bean! [Bean] Bye, Ivy! [music rising] [dogs barking] [kids playing in distance] [kid] Did you win, Leo? [Leo] No, but I was great. [bright music playing] [foreboding music playing] [groaning] [Bean moaning] That bathroom is haunted. [mysterious music playing] Sometimes it's easier to feel the ghost. It's like a cold wind passing right through you. I am honored to welcome you to curriculum night. [applause] [David] Where is Bean off to? [Nancy] You can bet she's up to something nefarious. Hide! [principal] Where's your hall pass? Detention! [principal] Hello, my lovelies.
