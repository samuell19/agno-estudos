All my friends have been married a long time. I guess I should marry, too I'd marry a girl in an instant, probably. If only I didn't see my friends' wives. That guy's lady - a real pain in the neck. Dressing up and making hairdos - her favourite pastime... Show me your leave-pass! Don't you know dress regulations? But Comrade officers... he'll have sun stroke. He'll survive. Aye, Comrade Lieutenant! - We can't have breaches of discipline. - Aye, Comrade Lieutenant! Comrade Lieutenant! Would you like some juice? It's against the regulations. - Can I give some to him? - You can. As you were! And don't forget - the army is not a health resort. Well, enjoy yourself. Scared, were you? Look, Lieutenant, what a girl. Not bad. Shall we make a closer acquaintance? Go and make it. Hot, isn't it? Yes. We're hot too. Why don't you go for a swim? Why don't you? We mustn't. We're on patrol. I beg pardon. Are you a local girl? What's it to you? - Lieutenant wants to make out with you. - Can I ask you something? What are you doing tonight? I have a date. - What time? - At half past nine on the embankment. Who with? Not you... Him. If I give him leave. Comrade Lieutenant, let's have our photos taken. For demob. We have the money. Whose dinner is this? Frolikov's. The Lieutenant is keeping him at the garage. He'll manage without it. - What's so funny? - Nothing... - So zip it. Where's my dinner? - It's up and gone. - Flew away. Why aren't you eating, Mitya? I don't feel like it. Here, eat it. I've lost my appetite. D'you think she'll come? Of course not. What if she does? Hey, you! Fried fish for me! - Me too. - No fish left, only porridge. Please... Platoon! Up! Down! Up! Down! Up! Down! - Pankin! - Not old-timers. Up! Stop chewing, you! Platoon, up! Out for line-up! Come on. Platoon! Fall in! Get a move on! Atten-shun! Forward march! A song! A white rose stands for a meeting. A red rose stands for love. A yellow rose stands for parting. And so we've been parted, you and I, yes, yes, yes. - Why do you love me? - Quiet! Platoon! Atten-shun! Left dress! Who has told you that, who has told you lies, Who's invented that I don't love you madly. In my soul I treasure your every glance, every move, The sound of your voice is ringing in my heart. No, I would never be able to stop loving you... Here I am. Hello. Where's Guryanov? I don't know, Comrade Lieutenant... At the barracks, probably. Who brought you up, Burkov? - Mother and father. - "Mother and father." So the Soviet school didn't educate you... Who taught you to lie, Burkov? Take me for an ass, do you? You think I don't know where he went? You think if you're due for demobbing no rules apply to you? You two will leave last! Comrade Lieutenant, we've signed contracts for a job in the North. Why should I trust them to you? D'you think it's a soft job? The frost there as low as 40 below. You won't be sunning your asses, as you do here! I'll alert the company... ...if you don't tell me... ...is Guryanov playing hooky? Tell me! Just you wait, Burkov! Shpanko! Shpanko, is that the way to stand? A messenger for Captain Rysakov! Aye, sir! A messenger for Captain Rysakov! Report for kitchen fatigue! Don't! You hear me? Don't! I will! Lay off. Let me go! Listen... Let me go. Please, don't! Want a slap on your mug? Well... Don't see me all the way to the hotel. Don't want to be seen with a private, do you? Please. That's as far as you come. I'll give you my Leningrad address: 35, Fontanka Street, Apt.18. Come, I'll show you Leningrad. Goodbye then. - Lieutenant sent a messenger for the captain. - So what? I was making excuses... He said he won't issue our contracts. Oh, he'll let us go alright. No other choice. Hey, when we've made a pile, let's come here again. We'll screw this coast over! Well, how did it go? Okay. - Did she let you kiss her? - Sure. So, high five me. - Lucky devil... - Shush! - Wake up, rookies! - Up with you! - Up, everybody! - Hurry! - On your feet! - Hey, you... - Why are you lying there? - Up, I say! So, it's been 30 days since the demobbing order. Begin the count up! - One... - Louder! Two... Three... - Why are you silent, countryman? - Up! Down! Up! - Count! - Four... - Louder! - Four! - Attaboy! Yeah, make some noise! Cut it out, Pankin! Up, you baby! Why aren't you counting? - Four... - Louder! - Five... - Give me your best. - Five! - Count. You count too. - Five. - Louder! - Five. Six, seven... Louder, I said! - Enough, Pankin. - What? Fuck off! Eight! Eight, I said! Nine! - What's up? - Come here! Ten... I told you to shut up. Didn't it mean anything? - Exactly! - Get lost! Pankin, stand down! - Lay off! - You get into bed! Count! - Just disappear... - Get lost, I said! - Captain! - Well, Pankin... Pankin, get up! Get your boots on. Comrade Captain, what happened? About turn! March! Mark time! Stop! About turn! March! Mark time! Insomnia, Pankin? I was asleep, Comrade Captain. Take that mop and do a hundred meter run! - Why, Comrade Captain? - Repeat the order! - Old-timers are not supposed to... - Pankin! "Take that mop and do a hundred meter run." Guryanov, up you get! Did you go AWOL? Where were you? You'll be the last to go home! I had a date, Comrade Captain. Getting married? No, Comrade Captain. Why go then? Would you like to go for re-engagement? You'll get promotion, an apartment... I'll write an application. No, Comrade Captain. We've signed contracts for a construction job. I've only seen life here, and that out of the barracks window. Here he is! - Greetings, Comrade Captain. - Hello. We're sorting things out. And I was going to alert the company... I wonder where he was. You don't remember? Has it slipped your mind? Shall I prod your memory? - Do. - Shut up! Listen, Guryanov... - Have you got parents? - Yes. - Was your father in the war? - Yes. - Did he also lie to his commanding officer? - How should I know? Judging by you he was lying. I know where you were tonight, don't you worry! You can go, Guryanov! Take them off! Let's keep him until the last. And his pal Burkov too. The Major promised to let him go first. Stay around for an hour, and then you may go. Learn to be a better judge of people or you won't hit it. Yes, I will, Comrade Captain. Regiment! Attention! Listen to a regimental order. The Minister of Defence decrees that... the following persons be discharged to the reserves: Sergeant Garikhmanov, Sergeant Guryanov, Sergeant Burkov, Sergeant Orlik, Private Gordiyenko... We are leaving this maritime region. Where we honestly served for two years. Everywhere is the happy young crowd. Everywhere are the songs and the cheers. Give a farewell glance to the young. No more training, no marching in step. We have cast all our cares aside We are going home. Sultry town, wish us well. We have cast all our cares aside We are going home. Sultry town, wish us well. By opening the treasured door I am a civilian now... Goodbye, and write us! Goodbye, Frolikov! - Keep your chin up! - Good luck! - We're free, guys! - Hurray for the demobbing! - Hello, Uncle! - Hello! So you're back... Wow! Look what they've got! Mum! Well, hello, Mum! Mitya... Mitya... - Look at that... - Come... Come... Let's go. Right-left, right-left... I'll take this. Mitya... Enough, Dad, I'm dying! I don't understand, Mitya... Why are you all forever running off? We want to see life, Father. To see life... I won't talk you out of it. But what about your mother? I'm sorry for her. She's been waiting... for you to come back... Oh well, what's the use? So you're going North? Yes, we've signed a contract. I don't see why you want to leave. You'd be fine here, there's a new club-house. If you want to study, you're welcome. We'll find you a job as won't interfere with your studies. I understand... It would be different if you wanted to become a doctor or an artist... But you can build here too. Who's stopping you? Show me your hands. Just the right sort. It's your native country - your own land and people. Your parents are around. I can always help you. Things will be hard in the North. The world is immense but Happiness travels faster than airplanes. And mine is pedalling, in no hurry, On a creaky old bicycle, without a worry. And mine is pedalling, in no hurry, On a creaky old bicycle, without a worry. At dawn to our town arrives happiness Aglow in the light of the rising sun, Whispering words of tenderness, Making people dizzy with love. And mine is pedalling, in no hurry, On a creaky old bicycle, without a worry. And mine is pedalling, in no hurry, On a creaky old bicycle, without a worry. Wake him up. Let him sleep some more. Wake him up, or he'll be late. Mitya... Mitya, it's time. Why, what's the matter? Don't, Mum. I'm not going alone, but with a friend. Don't cry, you're not seeing me off to war. If I don't like it there, I'll come back. I'll buy you a shawl. - I'm having three. - I'll buy a mohair shawl. My darling boy... Well... Stop it, mother. Let's shake hands, Dad. Go home, Druzhok! - What's your name, gorgeous? - Aren't you too familiar? He doesn't mean any harm. My name's Alyona. Do you earn a lot? Let me go, please. - Please be seated. - Okay. - She's classy! - She didn't appreciate your humor. Valera! This is a reinforcement for your team. - Dmitriy. - Valeriy. I'm Fyodor. Here are our hire contracts. - So you're a driver? - Second class. - And what about you? - I've no trade. - You'll do welding. - Okay. Where can we warm ourselves up? We're having a birthday party today. You'll meet the team and have some nice eats too. - Let's go to the dorm. - Come on! - You're late, team-leader! - Many happy returns! - Stasik, set 'em up. - Right away. Here. Pour out for the team-leader! - Gena. - Fyodor. - Gena. - Guryanov. And this is Stasik. - Demobbed? - Yes, sir! Sit down, guys. Come on! We got a spot for you. Ten years ago I too was a greenhorn, like you. And now... What's the matter? The song's over. From the very beginning! Let's have it again. I'll pay! Whose day is it today? Eh? It's mine! Here's to us. Look, the Soviet Airways are here! This is a red-letter day for me, guys! In the first place, I've hit 30. Absolutely, and that's all. - Let me hug you! - Hold on! - Why's that? - Relax, pal... And in the second, she's here... Polina... Polina, my sweet berry... will decide my fate today. If she says "yes", we get married. If she says "no", I'll marry her all the same. What I say goes! - Now - a kiss! - Kiss! "I must have a dance with you and nobody else..." Watch him dance. So you dance with the Airways but not with me? He's not drunk like you. I go on the wagon tomorrow. Then we'll have a talk tomorrow. - I'm serious... - Me too. Stop it. So that's how it is? It's his birthday... He'll be fine. - Really? - Yep. Enough playing! - What's the matter, Gena? - Nothing. - What's your order? - "The Moldovan Girl." As you wish. "The Moldovan Girl." Once at dawn in summer I happened, To my neighbour's orchard go. She's on fire. Where a dark Moldovan maiden Gathering grapes was singing low I went red, went white like death and Had a strange and sudden urge. The Airways is all alone... I'll try my luck... To ask if she wanted With me all new dawns to watch. Come on... Curly, leafy, my green maple with carven leaves. Off I go. I'm enamored and I'm shy because of this. My green maple, curly maple Leafy maple with carven leaves. Let's dance, shall we? Come and dance with me. Don't provoke him. Who's provoking? Come on. In return this swarthy maiden Had a good word for the lad: "The Moldovans are creating A guerrilla unit now. Let's dance! They have left first thing this morning, Went away into the woods. You will have to follow Their road through thick trees." Curly, leafy, my green maple with carven leaves. At the maple we will say our farewells. My green maple, curly maple Leafy maple with carven leaves. - God Almighty. - It's a crying shame! Alike as two peas... Where did you take that? People eat off that plate. I'll call the police. Call the police! - You get out of here - either in or out. - My heart is aching... - I'll lock the door! - And I'll smash the windows. I'll go and call the police. "How I love this dear old piece, "Don't you yap at me, don't you bark! "Come on, let me give you a kiss. "For the spring you woke up in my heart." It's awful hot there, and the water is warm. You get in and wonder - am I really in water? - Have you been to the South? - No. - Would you like to go? - Yes. - How much? - Very much. We'll go together then. I'll get you fired from your job! Let me in! See? Down with your plate! I'm keeping it simple. If you fit into the team, things will work out fine. The pay is good. The first month you'll get 300, the second - 300. Then - 500. Are you a drinker? - Not really. - And you don't have to. Let's go! - Come on! - I don't want to dance. It's your call. Give me the cloakroom tag. He'll find it in a minute... You keep your mouth shut. He's my friend... To hell with your friends. Did you have to get so swinish drunk? What have I done to deserve it? What? What for? He treats me worse than a dog. People feel sorry even for dogs. No one feels sorry for me... It's terribly hot there. 40 degrees. Dogs go bald from the heat. There're masses of fruit. And the holiday-makers have masses of money. Give me my shoes. Why? I live here. - In a shop? - Yes. Mainsail! It's torn and ruined! I repent and rue it! Wait, Polina... Mainsail! It's torn and ruined! I repent and rue it! Cutters dissected Guts of a whale with a whack... No one's expected Shots from behind in his back.. Batteries gunning, Leaving no shells in reserve... You should be running Fast on a curve! Here I stand before you, a plain Russian woman... who's been through it all, the husband's beating, the fighting and shooting, but still I'm living... Mitya, I love you! - D'you hear? - Yep. Private Guryanov, up and get! Guys, stop it! Stop it! What're you doing?! Genka! - What a louse you are! - Gena, are you insane?! - Enough! - Let me go! Hey, pal! D'you hear me? - Have you seen Burkov? - Over there, welding. Burkov, out! Mitka! - Hi! - Hello! Shall I tell you a scary thing... I'm getting married... Are you quite serious? I'm marrying Alyona. The wedding's in a week's time. More fool you! Mitya... Mitya! Will you come to the wedding? You could at least ask my advice... Are you mad? You'll catch cold! How I've missed you! I'll be back soon. - Burkov's getting married. - Really? This is for you. Thanks. Run along now, or you'll catch your death of cold. See you. Mitya... Does it fit me? I'll marry you. Really, why not? We'll get married and live together. The fact that we're so different... It doesn't matter. Yes. The main thing's that there should be love. Oh yeah. What? I'm a fool. I thought that if you started talking about love that would mean you're going to throw me over. Don't you listen to me... Marry me. We'll be fine, you'll see. I'll marry you. You're pacing like a caged tiger. What is it you want? You came here to make money, didn't you? I'll give you some. Don't, Polina. - It works alright? - Yes. It's Polina's wedding present. We waited for you. Why didn't you come? I've been busy. Fall in love, like the first time. Starting from the beginning... May I? Start it over Though every beginning is hard. Not everything lost. Believe in yourself. Start it over From scratch. Hurry, folks! Here. - D'you like your job? - It's okay. By the way, I earned 520 last month. Yeah. So... Eh? Hold it. Come and join us. You have a family to support now. Why should he? He's learning to operate an automatic lathe. His family's here, and the money's the same. You have a wife in a thousand! They promised us an apartment in spring. - Is that so? - Really? This merits a drink! Invariably! Pour out, host. - And what about your wife? - She mustn't drink. Why? You drink up. We're informal, okay? She's pregnant, that's why... I see. Things are fine with you. To you! - So I'll go to the Black Sea alone? - Fedya, turn the music off. Why alone? Fedya, don't! You needn't lecture me. Do I make myself clear? Yes. Everybody knows how I must live, I alone don't. You know how I must live, Polina, don't you? And he doesn't know, and me too. - Well, I... - Sit down! Where're you going? Far away from here. "I don't regret, don't call, don't cry..." - Hello. - Hello. Is anything the matter? There is. May I kiss you? Are you crazy? There's people about... To hell with them! Go on, I'll catch up with you. I'm going to have a baby. How can it be? I'm surprised myself. I didn't believe it at first, but it's a fact. The doctor said love works miracles. You're a fool... I said I'll marry you, and I will. But we can't afford a child right now. You have to understand. We haven't a thing to call our own. We'll live for a year or two, and then we'll see. Why d'you keep on about money? I'm not asking you for anything, Mitya. Just tell me - will you recognize him for your own? What? Will you let him bear your name? You don't love me at all. What has love to do with it? It's early days, that's all. I haven't seen life yet! Polina, don't cry. Don't. I'll come in a week's time, and you think about us. Be smart about it. From the darkness the years flow out Rustling noisily like a chamomile field. There's a dog in my memory now, She was my friend since I was a kid. Now the ardor of youth has turned quiet Like the maple by my window turned stale, I remember a girl dressed in white And a dog that delivered her mail. Where's Polina? In the hospital? She's gone. Where? What's it to you? You're a fool, Mitya. She took a plane. Where to? Where to? She told Alyona she'd go as far as Tyumen first. She said she didn't want to tie you down. What's up? - What's the matter? - Nothing. 1,623 rubles 98 kopecks. - Haven't you bigger notes? - Not for you. Stupid cow. Take your ruble! Andrei, are you two going? Yes, we're going, Polina Viktorovna. Why shave twice a day? - Open the door. - Why should I? Polina Viktorovna, please open the door. - Good evening. - Evening. Can I see Lucy? Lucy, somebody to see you. - Hello. - Hello. Can I come in? Where've you sprung from? From far away. Look at this fish! Good evening. Good evening. Is this your husband? We're late for the party. At night, in green thickets where tales rove, Where winds murmur in their futile searches. There the moon is watching a small grove, Nightingale's Grove of white Russian birches. - Your check... - Miss! Please, three cocktails to that table, as a favour! Pay 2-80. Now. There the nightingale, a Russian bird, Starts its piping song so bright and merry. With it, sorrows leave my soul and head. Giving rise to inspiration and passions, An expanse is only seen ahead, Full of human hopes and expectations! Look at him hoofing it! Hey! Can I lodge with you? I have money. I'll pay. Keep quiet. Get a taxi. The telephone's in the hall, on a long flex. Bedding's in the chest of drawers. Forty rubles a month. - Put them here. Is everything clear? - Yes. My mother used to live here... - Can I collect my order? - Yes. Sold. - Kostik, excuse me... - I don't have time. I can't attend to you all. Konstantin Mikhailovich, I'm counting on you. - People wait a month to see me. - I know. You know? There it is. I mean, if you want my help, be punctual. Punctuality is the politeness of kings. I had appendicitis... And what? Everybody has appendicitis. Appendicitis, cancer, angina... I come here first and leave last. Running back and forth. You get it? Hello, Konstantin Mikhailovich... I was sent by your colleague... They promised but... - I'll pay you on top... - Very well, wait a little. Mitya! Mitya, take this gentleman to Avtovo. Get some of those soaks to help load. Sanya! Well, you scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours. PLACE ORDER What's this now? Isn't the elevator working? No, it isn't. "No, it isn't..." - What kind of people are you? - Bring it here. Can't you read: No drinking hard spirits here! But they all drink. And take the bottles away, the tightwads. What's the fuss about? Take the bottles and clear off. - Be nice or I'll call the police. - Lay off! Hit it! That Guryanov seems a decent bloke, only too silent. I'm afraid of silent people. What are they thinking of? Mine's a gas-bag, so I have nothing to fear. My first husband was the silent sort. Came home, put on sneakers and no sound. Sun, water and air - - are our best... - Friends. Right. Lovely. Have one? Stop that. Swine! Aren't you ashamed for the boy? Fuck off... - Daddy, don't, please. - Leave me be. Mitya... Know what I've been thinking? Let's go somewhere in summer, maybe to the Black Sea. I've never seen the sea. Or we could save money... and buy a car. Mitya. Perhaps you don't like it that I'm a waitress? I can quit, shall I? I'll do whatever you tell me. It seemed that summer would never end, It seemed that summer would never end, But what about now, what about now? Yellow leaves circle above the city... Uncle Mitya, will we be there soon? Yes. Can't you drive slower? Why? If we get home soon, you'll go away, and I... don't want you to go away. Careful, boys! Do a proper job. Boss! - Congratulations! - Thank you. So... Here. You're stingy, boss. Oh, really? Sofa, two armchairs, chairs, trellis, sideboard - highly polished, all in perfect condition. They might get scratched in the elevator. Okay, here's another three. We only drink cognac, boss, five stars. I gave you 16, besides what I paid for delivery... Why such contempt for the working class? Delivery, another three... We're not in Liverpool, boss. - You call yourself the working class! - So who are we? Hucksters. Tone it down, boss. - Or what? - You'll see. Take care what you call us. Control that dog! Can't you have the lock changed? I'll go to the house office tomorrow. Three rubles to the locksmith, and he'll do it in a jiffy. Three? Three rubles to the locksmith, three to me, three to you. Everybody must be greased! I'm sick and tired of it! Five-star cognac! Why not nine stars? Yes? Why don't you ever go out? Where would I go? Bandage the wound. You said you could take on any beast, and you allowed a dog to bite you. Are you perhaps a bad person? Zina. I feel as though I'm falling headlong. Dear guests, since I am Zina's own aunt, allow me to say a few words. Be happy, children! Take care of each other. Bitter! Sweet! Why's everyone blue? Come on, let's dance! - Dance! - Yes, we'll dance! Let's dance! ...the martyr of Science. Here I stand, I hold an oar I will set off in a moment. My poor heart is full of Sadness and sorrow. Water quietly laps like a blue ribbon... Let's see who's stronger, northerner! Okay. It's been a long time since I had a good grapple. Please be alive and well as always I believe we'll meet again. - You're in good shape. - The food's good. So I see. If I don't accidentally die From the Latin. If the Romans and Greeks won't drive me mad... God bless you, my girl! Calm down, Auntie... Zina... What's this I see? Crying at a wedding? Zina, a word with you. Zina. Today is a big day for you. One must have a devoted friend by one's side... A friend in need. Dearer than your own dog. I wrote a poem about a dog once. "There's no one as devoted as that devoted dog, "who gave her little master a crust from her own hoard. "It was wartime. His parents and granny starved to death. "But thanks to a shaggy friend the little boy survived. "She gave him her last crust of bread, - "and on the house-steps she died. - Let's dance! "That boy grew up to manhood, but was a silent sort, "because he never found a friend." So it is in life - one must have somebody as devoted as a dog, then it will be a good life. We've lived together for many years Preserving the sacred vowel of loyalty and honor. Please be alive and well as always I believe we'll meet again... Alyona sends her regards. Our Valera is a big boy now. We wanted to call him Alexander at first. Fedya. Zina is a fine person, a very good woman, and I'm a dupe. A dupe. Some dupe. And I don't know what to do with myself! I don't know what to do! Guryanov. Guryanov! Oops. Friends! My friends, you... You two have a long, steep and hard road ahead of you. You must hold hands, support each other, keep up an all-round defense. We've sent a hat round... This is two-day's pickings. Money's the best thing, a "movable feast." Take it, girlie! Kostya. Thank you very much. What else can I say? Get the hell out of here. Now, you... It's all right. It's all right. It was a nice party... Had a nice drink, a nice chat... It's all right. - Come along, wife. - What's wrong with you all? Hubby... Hubby! Screenplay by Edward Topol and Boris Frumin. Directed by Boris Frumin. Camera: Aleksei Gambaryan. Sets: Yuri Pugach.
