(deep intense music) (building music) (siren alarming) (screaming) (loud eerie music) (intense thumping music) (sirens ringing) - Sam, what you got? (mumbles) What happened? - Somebody shot them. - Shot them? Damn. Anybody see anything? - Two kids over there found the bodies. Charlie's talking to them now, I don't know what he's got. I found this here business card. It's one of the reverends. And the baron found these letters. - Did you read them? - Some of them. - What some? - (mumbles) right in here. - Okay, take these over to the lab in Finleyville. Get the results back to me as soon as you can. I'm gonna talk to the kids and I'll be back in the office. - Okay, Sheriff. - See you later, Sam. - Come on, Wilbur. Homicide even said that he was shot in the head once and she was shot three times. Now, you're trying to tell me that she wasn't shot. - Just a little farther there, Frank. Someone ripped her tongue right out of her head first. - What? - And damn near cut her head clean off of her body. - Son of a bitch. (lighthearted soft music) (exciting soft music) - Cars out of gas. If you're going anywhere, you're gonna have to walk. - So what's new? I'm used to walking anywhere I wanna go. - Where are you going? - Prayer meeting, tonight's Wednesday. - Again! What you gonna have him pray for this time? (clanking) - For heaven's sakes, Moss, do you always have to think of that dirty physical stuff? - Okay, Clair, I get the message. - Let's try to act civilized. - We are married. What's uncivilized about being a man and a woman and having normal wants and needs? Clair, don't you remember when we were first married how warm and close we felt after we made love? - I don't remember, Samuel, anymore than you do, because if you did, you remember that I was doing the same thing then that I've doing for the past five years. Every time we touch, counting the crack in the seat. I (mumbles) like some two bit whore. After all, you are a minister. - Also a man, Clair. And your husband. - I told you, Samuel, don't touch me like that. I can't stand it and I never could. - I know, Clair. - One of these days, Samuel, one of these days we'll have this out completely. - No we won't because that might lead to divorce and your social standing couldn't take that. - Don't be so bias, you married me for my social standing. - The church gives me my standing, Clair. I married you because I loved you and I thought you were a woman. - I am a woman, you remind me of it every time you look at me. - I know, but I meant a human one. Well, are you coming? Your friends in my congregation are waiting. - I won't be going with you to church tonight, Moss. - Do what you thinks best. Goodnight, Clair. (slow organ music) May the good Lord bless and keep each and everyone of you. Drive carefully for I expect to see you, all of you, here next Sunday morning at 11:00 am. (deep organ music) - Thank you. - I, I was really moved by your sermon, Reverend. You're so understanding of people's needs. Our last minister was sort of, well, sort of old and... You know what I mean. - Why thank you, Miss, Miss? - Marilyn, Marilyn Howard. - Marilyn. A pleasure, Ms. Howard. - Marilyn. - Marilyn. It's getting late, do you have a way home or, or a car or something? - No, I just walked tonight. - Could I give you a ride home then? - Well, thank you, that would be very nice. - I have to turn off the lights and lock up first. You can wait in the car if you want to, it's over there. - All right, I'll meet you in the car. - Sometime I stop off for a cup of coffee or something after the service, is it too late for you? - Well, a small soda would be nice. (engine revving) (light rock music) - I'm glad the attendance at prayer meeting's growing, slowly but it's growing. You know, I think adding the choir helped with the attendance, don't you? - Mmm hmm. - The choir sounded great tonight, I think. - Yes, it did. - Ms. Howard, is something wrong? Ms... Marilyn? - Yes? - Is something wrong? - May I take your order, sir? - Sure, what would you like? - Just a small 7UP. - Coffee, one cream, one sugar, and a small 7UP. Thank you. - It's a beautiful evening. - Yeah, it certainly is. Is something wrong-- - You know, it's so nice just to sit and think on a night like this. - Marilyn, are you sure there's nothing bothering you? And you can be-- - Your order, Sir. - Thank you. - Just keep the change. - Thank you. - Marilyn, if you're troubled, I'd like to help. - There's nothing wrong! (tires squealing) - Don't you see, if we talk about-- - I am (mumbles) all right! (sobbing) I'm sorry. - It's all right. I don't think it will stain your dress. Do you wanna talk about it? - I... I can't. (sobbing) (slow rhythmic music) - Is your trouble at home? Is it your parents? - My husband. It's not his fault. It's just that my life, my whole existence has no meaning. There's no love in my marriage. Our marriage is simply a word. We aren't in love anymore. If we ever were. I just wanna be loved! - Now, now, I'm sure there are a lot of people who love you. - I don't mean that kind of love. I need the love and understanding of a husband. I need to feel like a woman. The way you need to feel like a man. - Shall we go? - Yes, please. (soft rock music) (loud sobbing) - Here, here. You know, you're a very attractive girl, even with mascara smeared all over your face. - Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, god, I can't go in like this, I'm a mess. - Would you like to get out of the car and get some fresh air? - Yes, yes, please. Thank you. - You feel better? - Yes, thank you. You know, you have a very nice smile. (eerie loud music) (moaning) Now I am a woman. - I think I should feel guilty, but I don't. - Neither do I. (scary rhythmic music) (peaceful soft music) Can we ever be like that? - No. (slow soft music) - Have you ever seen those before? - Should I have? - They were found next to your husband's body. - And? - [Sheriff] They're love letters from Marilyn Howard to your husband. - That steaming little bitch. - [Sheriff] I beg your pardon? - I said you're a son of a bitch. I've had enough of your filthy insinuations. If you wish to speak to me further, you can contact my attorney. - When comes back to town in a few days? (door slamming) Who's left out there? - Well, I got Jess Howard and Cooper, Moses Cooper. He's a Deacon down at the Reverend's church. Says he's got some information for us. It'll probably be another wild tale like Mrs. Sigmon. But we better listen to him. - Yeah, I guess you're right. Let's get it over with, bring him on in. We'll let Jess cool his heels for a while. Oh and Harry, see if you can get over to the Moss house and get Billy away from there without Ms. Moss knowing, bring him in. Hello, Mr. Cooper, I understand you have some information for us. - Indeed I do. You know, the Lord knows I'm not a man to gossip, but when a sin as evil as this one comes upon man, the burden on his heart becomes almost unbearable. And if I didn't discuss it with you and come at you with the truth, then I, myself, would be guilty of that sin of, the sin of omission. - Cooper, what are you trying to tell us? - What am I trying to tell you? I'm trying to tell you about a sin. A sin of such magnitude that it burdens my heart with grief. Now, I'm a benevolent man, but no one short of the almighty himself can give absolution for sin of such magnitude, one that has just been perpetrated against this church and our community. Now, do you realize that our young people have just been subjected to a sin more insidious than Judas himself? Yeah, there's been a Judas right here in our midst. - What sin? - Adultery. - Adultery! - That man and that woman, both good God fearing people, until the devil got his boney fingers hooked in their souls and drug them down to the deepest pits of hell. Them committing adultery, one with another. - [Man] Mose, do you have first hand knowledge of this alleged adultery? - First hand knowledge, you mean did I watch them? I did not and I would not. - Mr. Cooper, where were you Thursday night? - I was at the hospital praying for Sister Thomas, and you might be so happy to know that he assured me of her salvation. - Thank you, Mr. Cooper, you've been most helpful. - Why, you're most welcome. It was my duty. Sin shall not go unpunished. And should I get anymore visions, I'll come to you first. - [Man] Mr. Cooper, next time you get a vision, how about coming to us before they happen? - I'll have his alibi checked. - Do, but from the way he said it, I think he really was there. - Mmm mmm, yeah. Okay, yeah, and send Jess Howard here, I think he's cooled his heels long enough. Okay, bye. Come on in here, Jess, and sit down. Jess, when was the last time you saw your wife? - The night before last, she went to one of those church meetings or something and she didn't come home. - Did she do or say anything strange or unusual before she left? - No. She was might shook up when she left. But I didn't suspect nothing. You know how women are, they do things like that sometimes. - Did you know she was having an affair with Reverend Moss? - Hell no! She wasn't having no affair. The Reverend, he was a fine man and she was a good woman. They weren't having no affair. - Okay, Jess, you can go. I don't think he knows anything, besides Frankum says his alibi checks out. See what Billy knows. Come on in, Billy. Well, how are things up on the hill? - Okay. - Billy, you know that Reverend Sam's dead, don't you? - Sure. - [Sheriff] You notice anything funny going on up there? - Funny? No, just the usual stuff. - [Sheriff] You haven't noticed anything out of ordinary? - Nope. - Billy, has Jess Howard been up there lately? Billy? Billy, Billy! - Huh? - Jess Howard been up to your place lately? - Not that I can remember, but then he could've been there without me seeing him. - Yeah, I guess so. Okay, Billy, you can go on home now. - Well, it's been a month now. So, what have we got? We've been working on this damn thing for three weeks, every lead, every piece of evidence, nothing. We don't have a case against anyone. - Mr. District Attorney, has anything come from Mable Swank story? - Just Frank, please. Mable told us something about corn thieves and hearing noises that night. I don't know, she said she followed them up to the scene, saw a man and a woman standing over the bodies. She said it was Clair Moss and Billy Spencer. - Could be. - Nope, we held them both in. They had alibis and good ones, they were clean. Anyway, when I asked Mable how come she waited a month to come over, she didn't tell us anything. Nothing. Guess on a case like this, you gotta expect cranks. You got anything, Wilbur? - I'm afraid our leads were dead ends too. - Well, Bill, Wilbur, guess we don't have a case. Might as well work on some of our other stuff. Thank you, Bill. Thanks for your help, Wilbur. Of course, anything new does come up, you guys let me know. - Right away. - Okay. (light knocking) - Hi, Carol Jenkins? - Uh huh. - My name's Chuck Harper and I've-- - Whatever you're selling, I'm not interested in. - Oh no, man, I'm not a salesman, I'm a reporter. - That's worse. - I wanna help reopen your case, your sister's murder. - How? - I'm interviewing all the people who were involved in the case for a feature story. - It's been over a year, that won't help. - There's some new evidence. - What evidence? - Well, I can't say yet but you might be able to give me some information that will help. - Well, come on in. Chuck, we've been seeing each other everyday now for over a week and you still haven't told me what you found out. - [Chuck] It's a secret. - Please. - Okay, okay. Two things, remember the business card found at the scene? - Mmm hmm. - Well, originally they couldn't find anything, but I found out that there really was an identification of the fingerprint. It belongs to William Spencer. - Do you mean Billy? - Yup, Clair Moss's brother. Isn't he that kid who's kind of dumb, or weird, or something? - Well, most people say he's just a bit crazy, but harmless. (birds tweeting) - Crazy Billy. I'm gonna have to use that in my story. Anyway, there's more. I was in divorce court in Franklin and I heard Clair Moss's name mentioned. It sounded interesting so I sat in. It seems this woman, Joan Lindsay, had been working for a maid for Clair Moss was getting a divorce. You're not gonna believe it but her husband was suing for divorce on the grounds that his wife had come to him under false pretenses. He claims that she'd been a mistress of the Reverend Moss and had been paid $5,000 to keep her mouth shut about anything she heard concerning the murder. - Do you mean that this might-- - I mean, with all the commotion that we're gonna create in the newspapers around here, we just might get together to reopen this case. - Oh, Chuck. (laughing) (birds tweeting) - Get me the DA, Franklin Grover! He's in, he's in Cleveland. Idiot. (buzzing) Grover, Grover, this is Baldwin at the Cabinet. What the hell are you all doing down there? Why don't you get off your fat asses and get something accomplished? You know, I don't see how the devil you hold a job down there, we have elections here at the capitol. And one's going on right now! Now, listen damn it, I want you to get out there and get something done! I want this Moss Howard thing cleared up! You got me smeared all over the front page of the paper! Now, do we understand each other? Clear the damn thing up once and for all, and I want a conviction! (sighing) - Guess who doesn't really have an alibi? - Who? - Mose Cooper. - Oh, come on, Harry. He was at the hospital all night. 50 people saw him there. - Yeah, and the old lady he was praying for died at 8:05. Cooper left the hospital and he said he went fishing to meditate at night. - Anybody see him leave the hospital? Does he have any witnesses at all? So, he says he went fishing, huh? That time of night. Pick him up, Harry, book him, suspicion of murder one. - And after you left the hospital, you were still feeling upset so you went fishing, I believe, until late that night. - Yes, sir. I was very depressed and very worried. And I went out fishing to meditate. Communicate with my Lord. - Thank you, thank you very much, Mr. Cooper. That will be all. Your witness. - Uh, Mr. Cooper, I have a few questions, sir. Mr. Cooper, you are a religious man? - Yes, sir, I am. - And you believe in the Old Testament? - Yes, sir. - And do you believe in the Bible literally? - Word for word. - And do you believe, then, word for word, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth? - Yes, sir. In fact, only two nights before the murder, I had a vision and the Lord said he was displeased. He was gonna send one of his angels back to earth and with the help of a faithful follower, he was gonna go out and gonna smite down that adulterer and that adulteress. Vengeance is mine, say it the Lord! - No further questions, your Honor. Thank you, Mr. Cooper. And in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, we have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the defendant had the opportunity to commit these crimes. He would have us believe that he was fishing the night of the murder. Fishing all night long. This self righteous sanctimonious man set himself up as judge, jury, and executioner. There is no doubt of his guilt. The overwhelming facts demand that you find him guilty of murder in the first degree. And the state asks that you recommend for this man, who committed an act so terrible, so horrible, so malicious. Ladies and gentlemen, you have no choice except to demand the death penalty for this man, for this premeditated act of cold blooded murder. The death penalty, ladies and gentlemen, for this man! (intense dramatic music) Mose Cooper! - Is the defense ready for summation? - Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you have just witnessed the most obscene perpetration of injustice that's ever been attempted in this country. The prosecution has given us no facts, no proof. Now, they have established that Deacon Cooper is a very religious man. Is that a crime? And then they insult him by calling him a pious hypocrite. Well, to some extent or another, aren't we all? Now, they have established that Mr. Cooper cannot account for his exact whereabouts in front of witnesses on that particular evening. The evening of the murder. Let me ask you this, how many of you can prove to us exactly where you were on any given night a month ago, much less half a year ago? But you're not on trial for your life. That poor man is. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, please remember this as you retire to the jury room. Each one of you could just as easily be sitting in the defendant's chair. Convict this man on this flimsy circumstantial evidence and you could just as easily be convicting yourself. Mose Cooper is just as innocent as you are. Thank you. - All rise. - How you doing, Chuck? - I should ask how you're doing. - Uh, you saw it. - You know, I'm partially responsible for getting this case reopened, but whether he did it or not, they sure didn't have much of a case. This trial was run a whole lot like the Spanish Inquisition. Do you have a chance? - Not much. Governor Baldwin's really pushing Grover for a conviction on this one. If the jury comes right back in, we might stand a chance. If they stay out for any length of time, we're sunk. - DA Special Investigator hurt you a lot. Mr. Cooper said this and Mr. Cooper said that. - Yeah, and it was all hearsay evidence too. But the judge, he denied my objections until after Grover had finished. By then, the damage was done. Oh, he instructed the jury to disregard the testimony, but they heard it. - Well, hear they come. - Wish us luck. - All right. - All rise. (loud banging) - Has the jury reached its verdict? - Yes, we have, Your Honor. We find the defendant guilty as charged and we recommend he be sentenced to death. - Mose, it's time to go. - I'm free? - No, there's been no word. (deep scary music) - Mose Cooper, you've been tried and convicted by a jury of your peers and have been found guilty of murder in the first degree. The state has sentenced you to die by electrocution, on this, the 30th day of August and the year of our Lord, 1972, until you are dead, dead, dead. Mose Cooper, do you have a statement to make? The blindfold, please. (intense rhythmic music) (phone ringing) Hold it! Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. Stop the execution, the governor signed a reprieve. Release him and take him back to his cell. - Well, thank you, Sheriff. Now, explain to me just how Mr. Cooper was reprieved. - Well, he was having this affair with Janice Meechum, she works over at the Sportsman Bar and Grill, divorced, got three kids. Well, he was with her all night. Of course the hypocritical old bastard didn't want anybody to know it. In fact, I think he'd rather die than let anybody know he was human. - Well, how'd she get him reprieved? - Well, her conscious got to her when she heard he was gonna be executed. So, she just went to the DA and told him the truth. (laughing) I'll bet Grover about crapped in his pants. Anyway, Grover called the Governor and saved Mose. Hell, they all ready had him strapped to the chair. He was about 15 seconds away from getting fried. - Where's Mose now? - He's over at the County Home. He just never could seem to get over it. A friend of mine over there, a doctor, said that he probably would get better but he never would be the same. - You know, my paper's getting down pretty hard on capital punishment. - You know, it's just like them. I sometimes wonder what side they're really on. I guess that just whatever's most sensational at the time. Now, they don't give a damn about anything except selling newspapers. - Say old Mose was really having an affair, huh? Who'd thought it? Tell me about it. - Well, I'll tell you all I know. Janice said she really liked him, he brought things over to her, you know, and that sort of thing, and she said he was the only man that really halfway treated her decent. - [Chuck] What about that night? - Well, he came over just like he always did, and he brought her one of those real flimsy, shorty nightgowns, I guess she modeled it all over the house for him. Anyway, he spent the whole night there, just like he did every Thursday night. Looks like I was right in the beginning. The DA's all ready decided or finally decided to listen to old Mable Swank, you know the good woman? They want me to go pick up Clair Moss and Billy Spencer right now. - Well, thank you, Sheriff. - It's a pleasure. (fun energetic music) (buzzing) - How you doing tonight, Sheriff? - Pretty good. - Fine. - Looks like you got a nice crowd. - Yeah, pretty nice crowd tonight, (mumbles) pretty good. (mumbles) - I heard when he came up. - Yeah. - Seen Billy Spencer running around? Billy Spencer. I have a warrant for your arrest. - Can I see that warrant. - I'll show you down at the jail (mumbles). Come on. Come on. (fun energetic music) - Harry, I've got to be damn sure on this one. Let's go over what we've got. - Okay, Mable Swank has told us she actually saw the murders take place. - I'm gonna save her until the end of my presentation. What else? - Joan Lindsay, Clair MOss's maid, she approved the motive. - All right. What about Wilma Sigmon? - [Harry] She's our weakest witness. She'll tell about the affair, that Clair knew about it. - Fine. - [Harry] Can't hurt. We also have Lee Davidson, the one who says he recognized Billy and Clair voices at the scene. What do you think? - Well, he's another witness that places him at the scene, I guess. Put his name up on the board. - Here in this small southern town, the officials in charge of this case are being very closed mouthed. They're giving us little or no information. Curiosity seekers from all over the state are pouring in by the thousands to see the scene of the crime, the Reverend's church, and the Spencer Moss mansion up on the hill. Imaginative local residents have turned this into a miniature boom town. Many tour guide services have been established and hot dog and soft drink stands are popping up everywhere. Everyone seems to be profiting from this tragedy except the immediate family of the victims. The entire jury selection was completed yesterday with a defense counselor turning down no perspective jurors. I believe we, yes, we are about ready to hear the prosecutions opening remarks. - Now, I'm sure, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my esteemed adversary, Mr. Kline, will try to alter the facts and confuse my witnesses. But the evidence in this case will prevail. I intend to prove that Clair Moss was embarrassed and humiliated by her husband's affair with a member of his choir. And at that point, she made the fatal decision to end it. Listening in over the phone extension, Clair Moss overheard the two lovers arrange a clandestine meeting on Hoffman Road. She then called her brother, Billy Spencer, into the library and the two of them set out to ambush the Reverend Moss and his mistress. I have two witnesses who can place them at the scene of the crime. And one of them actually witnessed the murders. She actually witnessed the murders, ladies and gentlemen! Thank you. - The defense may present its opening remarks. - If it pleases the court, we have nothing to offer at this time. - Is the prosecution ready to present its case? - Yes, your Honor. - You may proceed. - Your Honor, prosecution calls County Detective Harry Frankum. - County Detective Harry Frankum. Put your left hand on the Bible, raise your right. You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God. - I do. - You may be seated. - Thank you. Mr. Frankum, will you please explain to the court the events surrounding the exhumation of the bodies and your subsequent findings? - Yes, in light of new evidence uncovered in this case, the court ordered the case reopened, full examination of the bodies. - Wilbur, what's a decomposed body look like? - Frank, you don't wanna know. - No. (loud scary music) Now, in addition to these three bullet holes, what else did you find in your autopsy, sir? - Well, as in the previous autopsy, we found that Ms. Howard has a laceration across her neck. And her tongue had been severed. - Her throat had been cut, almost completely severing her head from her body. And her tongue had been ripped, ripped, out of her head. Then, and then only, was she shot three times. Is that correct? - Yes. - Thank you. Your witness. - [Judge] Consulate. - Yes, your Honor. - Your witness. - No questions, your Honor. But if I might, I would like to recall the witnesses at a later time. - We call Lee Davison. Mr. Davison, where were you on the night of the murders? (throat clearing) - Well, on that night, me and a friend was out on Hoffman Road Park, and we was in the backseat of the car. And uh... (moaning) (giggling) - You and your damn belt buckle! Not again. (mumbles) Lee. You go before I even get started. - Shh! (moaning) Hey Helen, what's with the toe bit? - Well, you didn't even give me a chance to take my pantyhose off first! (laughing) - Hey, would you shut up, somebody's coming. - Well, it's not me. - Ah, shut up. Hey, who do you recon that was? - Who cares? Come on, Lee, let's get going. Honey. - Huh? - Will you love me always. - Yeah, which way you want me to love you first? - Screw you! - I wish you would, come on. (moaning) - Now, Mr. Davison, did you recognize any of the voices? - Yes, sir, two of them. - Who were they? - They were Clair Moss and Billy Spencer. - Thank you, Mr. Davison. Your witness. - I have no questions at this time, your Honor. Reserve the right to be called. - The prosecution may continue. - If it please the court, the prosecution rests. - All rise. - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is John Surrat of TWATV with a further report on the nationally famous murder trial taking place here today. We have seen the prosecution evolve what appears to be an insurmountable amount of evidence and the defense hasn't even cross examined a witness during this sensational trial happening here today. We'll be back with our on the spot coverage tomorrow morning at 10:00 am. This is John Surrat with TWATV news signing off. Okay, Harry, that's a wrap. Gotta work all damn day in this heat and I'm getting tired of all this garbage. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As we resume our coverage this morning, we find one of the co-defendants on the stand. We will now go to the cross examination by the District Attorney of defendant crazy Billy Spencer. - Hi, Billy. Did you kill Reverend Moss and Marilyn Howard? - Do what? - Kill them? - Kill who? - The Reverend... Nevermind, you know, a lot of people around town say that you're crazy, Billy. Are you? - Lots of people are crazy about something. Aren't you crazy about your wife? - What are you crazy about, Billy? Now, you understand what I'm saying, what are you crazy about? - I don't know. I guess hot fudge sundaes. (light cracking) - Billy, a lot of people around town are saying that you and your sister, Clair, killed Reverend Moss and Marilyn Howard. Is that true? - That's what I hear. - We don't want to know what you hear, we want to know what you know, absolutely! Just the facts. Let's start from the beginning. What's your name? - Billy Spencer. - Where do you live? - At my house. (laughing) - Where were you born? - Well, I really can't say. You see, I was an infant at the time and I can't remember with any accuracy. (people laughing) - Billy, did your mother have any children who lived? I'm sorry, your Honor. I have no further questions. - What you have just seen is the defendant, William Spencer, who has been dubbed Crazy Billy. Mr. Spencer did not look at all crazy during the exchange. We will take you back to the courtroom for a continuation of our live on the spot coverage of today's events. - Thank you, your Honor. The defense wishes to recall the prosecutions witnesses. - [Judge] All of them? - Most of them. - Objection, your Honor! The defense had its opportunity yesterday. - Your Honor, Brown versus Brown states-- - [Judge] Sir, I'm aware of those decisions and I'm ruling in your favor. Objection overruled, you may proceed. - Your Honor, I call Wilma Sigmon. You are absolutely positive that Clair Moss knew of the alleged affair between Reverend Moss and Marilyn Howard? - Yes, sir, absolutely. - How do you know this to be a fact? - I heard. - From whom and what did you hear? - Well, I just heard. - Do you have first hands knowledge that Clair Moss knew of the relationship between Reverend Moss and Marilyn Howard? - Well, I don't remember who told me. But it must have been a good source or I wouldn't dare repeat it. - Thank you, Mrs. Sigmon. Your Honor, I move that this witness's previous testimony be stricken from the record as hearsay. - [Attorney Grover] Your Honor! - Mr. Grover, if you wish the court to entertain (mumbles) on emotion, we will adjourn in my chambers. Very well, the entire previous testimony of Wilma Sigmon will be stricken and the jury will disregard all such testimony. - Thank you, your Honor. I now call Joan Lindsay. Mrs. Lindsay, you saw Mrs. Moss pick up the phone and put it to her ear? - Yes, sir. - [Attorney] You stood and watched her? - No, sir, I was setting the table. I didn't want to stare at her but she didn't leave the telephone table. - She stood beside the phone but you can't be certain she overheard the entire conversation? - No, sir. - [Attorney] She could've put the phone down? - Yes, sir. - [Attorney] Point two. Later that same evening when the defendants were together in the library, did you overhear their conversation? - Parts of it, I went in (mumbles) with coffee. - [Attorney] Well, what did you hear? - They were planning to kill Reverend-- - [Attorney] No, I mean, what were their exact words. - Exact? - [Attorney] As closely as you can remember. - Mrs. Moss said that they definitely had to handle the situation and that they should take care of it tonight. Later when I went in, Mrs. Moss told Billy that he would be most beneficial. I remember those words for sure, most beneficial. And she said that Billy could do everything, all she would do was supervise. - Did either person actually say they were going to kill anyone? - No. - [Attorney] Then what you actually heard was the defendants alluding to what you assumed was going to be a crime. - I guess that's what they did. - Joan, may I call you Joan? Joan, is it possible that Mrs. Moss and her brother were discussing a business venture, or some other matter that had nothing to do with a crime of which they're now accused? - I guess, maybe. - [Attorney] Now, point three. Why did Mrs. Moss pay you $5,000? - Her exact words were to keep your mouth shut. - [Attorney] About what? - About what I saw and heard! - Were you having an affair with Samuel Moss? - Yes, sir. - [Attorney] Did Clair Moss know about it? - Yes, sir. - Did she kill you? - No, sir! - [Attorney] She gave you $5,000 and asked you not to talk about it, didn't she? - I thought she meant about the murder! - [Attorney] But isn't it more logical to believe that she wanted you to keep quiet about your affair? - I'm sorry, Mrs. Moss. All this time I really believed you did it. But I guess you didn't. - Mr. Davison, what were you doing in the backseat of your car? - We were making out. - Mr. Davison, you are a remarkable man. You have testified that you were making out in the backseat of your car with your lady friend, and in the midst of this heated activity, you heard voices well enough to identify the person speaking? And yet, you ask us to believe that even though you could identify the person speaking, you could not hear the words said. - Well, I heard them. Now, we parked out on Canton Road and we was in the backseat of-- - Canton Road, you said Hoffman Road. - Yeah, yeah, I mean Hoffman Road, Hoffman Road. - Which one? - Uh, uh, look, you're confusing me, mmm hmm. - Where were you, Mr. Davison? - I don't remember. - Are you sure the voices you heard belong to the defendants? - Mmm, no. - Will you say that a little louder, sir? - No, but it was a man and a woman and it must've been them, must've. - Thank you, Mr. Davison. Redirect. - No questions, your Honor. - [Judge] The defense may proceed. - If it pleases the court, the defense rests. - Your Honor, the prosecution has a material witness who has been unable to testify until this time. - You may proceed. - The people call Mable Swank. - Sorry to inconvenience you in this manner, Mrs. Swank. - Miss. - [Judge] Yes, you may proceed, counsel. - Thank you, your Honor. - I realize that you're extremely ill and that this is quite an imposition. So, I'll spare you the burden of questioning. Will you please explain, for the entire court, exactly what you saw on the night of the murders? - Well, I had been bothered with corn thieves for sometime. So, the night when I heard the noises, I drove my mule to see where it was. I drove across Shelton's place and that it were... So, I tied my mule to a tree. And I snuck up on them through the bushes and I hid behind their car. - All right, Moss, you came out here to lay her! Lay her! Get down on the ground and go to it, now! Undress her, Moss, unveil her beauty. Do it! (soft sobbing) Now the rest. Is she a woman, Moss? A real woman, a human woman? - Clair, think what you're doing! - [Clair] Shut up. Kiss her, Moss. Make love to her. Show me how the animals do it. (soft sobbing) Do you feel like a man now, Moss? You don't look anymore like a man. (crying) (gun firing) (loud screaming) Give me your knife. - No! No! No, please, please! No, no, no! (grunting) - And then they shot her three or four times. - And that's all you saw? - Oh, no. The worst of all, after they killed her, they went back over and dressed them up real respect. And laid them out real proper like, just like an undertaker, and that's all I saw. - [Attorney Grover] Thank you. Your witness. - Thank you. Ms. Swank, I have several questions to ask you, so I'll get right to it. Why didn't you tell your story to the police immediately after it happened? - Didn't nobody ask me. - [Attorney] I see. How long have you lived here, Miss... - Mable. - [Attorney] Mable. - A good while. - [Attorney] Where did you live before you came here? - No where in particular. - [Attorney] I would like to know where in particular. - The witness will answer the question. - I don't remember. - [Attorney] Do you remember what you did there? - No. - Your Honor, I have here a deposition from the psychiatrist, Dr. Howard. - It's not (mumbles)! Don't tell him nothing! - [Attorney] I think you've told us quite enough, thank you. (loud banging) - I'm not quite sure I know what just happened. We'll discuss it later in our chambers, Mr. Grover. You may continue the defense. - The defense rests, your Honor. - Is the prosecution prepared for a summation? - Uh, yes, your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen, I intend to be brief. The defense has presented us with not one shred of evidence, he has merely tried to confuse and slander my witnesses. Do not let this confuse the facts. The facts are that these two people willingly plotted the execution of two innocent human beings. They are murderers! We implore you to sift through the actual facts. And the state demands that you find them guilty of murder in the first degree, and that they each be sentenced to die in the electric chair. Thank you. - Thank you, your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I too, shall be brief. I don't believe I've confused anyone. In performing my responsibilities to this court and to the defendants, I, along with you, have listened to the prosecution's arguments and the prosecution's witnesses. We have discovered the truth. Now, there is a matter of great importance I must discuss with you, that of reasonable doubt. In the last two days, we've heard testimony intended to establish the guilt of these two defendants. That testimony has failed. There's a great deal of room for doubt. And with that reasonable doubt, you must judge on the side of acquittal. For to make a mistake on the side of conviction would be tragedy. For you, the defendants, and for our sacred system of justice. Thank you. - Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, it is my responsibility to charge you with your responsibilities. You may retire to the jury room and decide the guilt or innocence of the defendants. Weigh these facts carefully, be considerate whether it is or is not reasonable doubt. If the defendants are guilty, you must recommend sentence. Weigh the (mumbles) in this case, decide if it's life imprisonment or execution. So you are charged, the jury will retire. - Well, that was certainly the most beautiful job of killing of an eyewitnesses testimony that I've ever seen. Mr. Kline, Mrs. Moss's attorney, sure pulled a surprise of the year. Just as an unbeatable case had been painstakingly built by the DA, Kline completely discredited all the witnesses in as cool and calm a manner as a dentist extracts a tooth. From where I sat, a complete acquittal will be forthcoming. (dramatic intense music) - Quit, Billy. (high pitched intense music) - Billy, calm down. - The defendants and their attorneys seem very confident, as well they should be. The jury has been out for two hours now and... Just a moment, something's going on in there. (loud screaming) - I'm not gonna die for your insane jealousy! She did it! - Now, Billy, sit down. (screaming) (gun firing) (screaming) - Ladies and gentlemen, this was certainly the most bizarre turn of events that I have personally ever witnessed. The jury had reached their verdict and found the defendants innocent of all charges. But before they were able to announce that verdict, the witnessed William Spencer, Crazy Billy, perpetrate a courtroom shoot out, which took the lives of two innocent onlookers as well as the defense attorney and a policeman, culminating in his own death. During the melee, crazy Billy was heard by the entire courtroom, screaming that his sister, Clair Moss, had committed the murders. The jury has just returned the verdict of guilty as charged of murder in the first degree. And we are awaiting sentencing. - [Judge] Clair S Moss, you have been found guilty of murder in the first degree, and I, therefore, sentence you to die by electrocution on the first day of December, in the year of our Lord, 1972, until you are dead, dead, dead. (soft singing) (loud rumbling) (soft humming) (deep dark music) - Okay, Clair, it's time to go. - Don't worry, Missy, it will be over soon. Jesus loves you and I'll be praying for you. - [Clair] You better pray for yourself! (deep intense music) How, like this? - Clair Spencer Moss, you have been tried and convicted by a jury of your peers. And have been found guilty of murder in the first degree. The state has sentenced you to die by electrocution on this, first day of December, the year of our Lord, 1972, until you are dead, dead, dead. Clair Moss, do you have a final statement? - That two timing son of a bitch! (deep intense music) - Jesus, Mary, and Joseph assist me in my last (mumbles) amen. (scary loud music)
