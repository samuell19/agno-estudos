JJ, you know, Cutter says he's going to win today. Cutter who? Hey, go get them. Will do. Thanks, buddy. Does everything check out? Yeah, it's checked out. Just relax. All right. Relax. You ready for this? What do you think? Hey, guys. Hey, Tammy. JJ, you're not taking Hiroto from me. They're mine. Yeah? Why don't we let them decide. Let's decide right now. Hey, it's not my fault you lost everything. You're going down, JJ. Save it for the race. Yeah, let's do it. Good luck. Thanks. I can't lose, Cliff. Just relax. Thanks. If you win, you're in. You lose... Don't make the news. Let's win this thing. JJ Sawyer moving up in the turn. So far, he's been holding back. For a lot of fans watching today, this is a two-man race between Sawyer and Cutter McCullough in the pole position. Best friends from the small town of Farewell Bend. They were teammates until McCullough split up, making them rivals. Sawyer pulling in to what will be his final pit stop. She doesn't feel right. Like how? I don't know. Sounds like the mix is off. OK, let's go. Coming in awful close. Yeah, I know. OK, go. I don't know what's going on in there, JJ. Maybe we ought to pull the plug. - No. Listen to me kid. I can't promise it won't blow up in your face. Button her down. Do it. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. It looks like an exciting finish. We're coming to the final two laps. Cutter. Hey, aren't you JJ Sawyer? That's right. Well, I'll be. You know, I wrapped my nose around a power pole trying to be you. You're racing again? No, I just drive the truck, man. Fair enough. Good to see you. What's the good word, Chuck. Looks like we need the car a day earlier than we thought, JJ. You're kidding me, right? They jacked us around on the schedule. There's nothing I can do about it. Any problems, JJ? Yeah, you know, I've taken every back road already to make up time but, hey, no problem. Unbelievable, unbelievable. Son of a bitch. Oh, man. You all right? Yeah, I'd be a lot better if you were chasing that son of a bitch that just ran me off the road. Hey, aren't you... Tom Hodges, how are you doing, JJ? Long time. Yeah. Deputy Hodges. Well, they call me Sheriff now. It's what happens when you single handed stop an armed bank robbery in progress. Oh, yeah? You did that? No, I just ran for office, and they elected me. Yours? Nah, it's a team truck. Still in racing, huh? Yeah, just driving. That's a bad leak. You want to get that checked. Yeah, man, I... I'm just so late already. Long haul. You could say that. Oh, well, then you want to get your rig checked for sure. I know just the place. So, you know, how long has it been? Like 10, 15 years? At least, at least. Well, he hasn't changed much. Yeah, I'll bet. Follow me. All right, just keep an eye on me then. You want to lift into town? Nah, nah, I think I remember the way. All right, welcome back, JJ. Thanks. How you doing? Hello. Hello. Cutter. OK, how can I help you? JJ. Hey, Cliff. Well, what do you know. Well, I know Tom Hodges has a real sense of humor. It's good to see you. You too. Wow, JJ Sawyer. What are you doing here? I took a little detour off the pavement. Wow, the great JJ goes off the outside edge, huh? It happens, you know. Yeah, I got power steering went out on me. I got a leak anyway. Maybe check it out. Power steering. Hey, Bodie. Bodie. Check under that rig for me, will you? The power steer... this is a priority. Power steering. Tighten that, would you? Good place. Shangri-La, such as it is. Not the same as working the crew. You know, I got off the circuit. After the accident, I just... I got my own crew now, and... got a car in there? Sure do. Take a look? Yeah, sure. Wow, now that is a piece of art. What do you top her out at? They have guys for that. Ah, right. Do you mind? No, go ahead. I do miss it. It still gets my blood up. Drink? Ah, I don't know. Come on. All right, maybe I'll have one. Why not? Take a load off. To old friends. To you. Oh. Oh, that's good. You want to see her? No, no, I got a deadline. Are you sure? She'd probably like to see you. How's she doing? Took her a few years to get over my brother. It was a hard time, but, you know, I was there for her. You heard about the wedding? Yeah, congratulations. JJ Sawyer rolling into town now. That is a coincidence. How's that? I don't know. Why not? Come one, step out back. Step out back? Yeah, yeah, yeah, grab your drink. I'm not taking no for an answer. All right. Where you taking me, Cliff? Fair is fair, JJ. You showed me yours. I'll show you mine. But before we do... Yeah, all right. I'm glad I'm walking, all right. Wait for it. I'm waiting. Wait for it. Yeah, you're not dreaming. That's really it. That's Cutter's car. I rebuilt it myself. Yeah, I made a few changes here and there. You know, make it good for the street. I only just finished it, and you show up. Tammy doesn't even want to look at it. I'm out of here, Cliff. You know, it's strange, huh? I mean, I finish it, and you show it. What do you suppose that means? Doesn't mean anything. No, it does. It does, JJ. It can't be a coincidence. This is fate talking. JJ, listen to me. Nobody was supposed to get hurt, OK? It was Cutter, and he put me up to it. Put you up to what? You car, we sabotaged it. I mean, he needed his sponsors, all right? He needed... he needed Hiroto. You sabotaged my car. Son of a bitch. Ah. Cutter had something on... on one of your pit boys. Hey, hey, what in the hell is going on here? What are you doing here? I'm sorry. You OK? You all right? - Ah. What happened? Do the best you can. Hey, we need a car. Some drinking and fast driving will make you feel better. That trucker really kill your dad? How would I know? Hey, maybe we should get him to kill mine. Woo. Oh, ow. Show some respect, dude. I think I'm in love. How you doing? Hey. Hey, give me your lager. There you go Thanks. Oh, god. OK, wait. You got to help me. If you bleed on me, I'll kick your ass. I got my ass kicked by a girl, man. You did. Whoa, check it out. Whoa, dude, that is sick. Oh, man. Let's have some fun. Let's do this. Check the trunk for a six pack. See if it's our lucky day. I will. Yeah, woo. Oh. It's roomy in here, man. Seat belts and everything. Taz. Hi, how can I help you? I'm supposed to fill out a form. JJ, come on in. It's OK. You made it. Yeah. The state police caught your friend in a speed check before he ended up killing somebody. That's good. Yeah, what happened to your hand? Oh, I stuck it where it didn't belong. How's your rig? Well, I think I might need a new mechanic. Oh, Cliff's the best, JJ. He's good people. You fill out this part. All right. Sign it there. You were the first citation I ever wrote out. You and Cutter back when you were both hell raisers. You didn't have any time for me, and I guess I rode you too hard. You know what, Tom? I'd rather not reminisce. Fair enough. I used to drive out to Craig Loop and see your folks a lot. They were always talking about you. Oh, JJ is going to come back home real soon. Here you go. Filled it out. Signed it. You can write it up any way you want. What's your rush? Hey, what do you want from me, Tom? So I didn't show up for the funeral. That's between me and them, and my maker. Right, you quit on everybody, didn't you? Let me tell you something. Nobody blamed you for that accident. You did that yourself. The town lost a hero that day. It didn't need to lose two. You could learn something from Cliff. So could you, Tom. Compliments of the management. It's parked out on Main. So what happened back there? Nothing. Funny, that's what Cliff said. So you just knock out your old friends for the fun of it. Look, it was my fault, OK? Some hello after 17 years. Hello, Tammy. You look great. Oh, gee, thanks. So do you. What are you doing here, JJ? Leaving. No, you already did that. Talk to me. What do you want me to say? I don't know. Stick around for a while. You'll think of something. There's nothing for me here, Tam. Thanks for the truck. It's good seeing you again. Hey, let me go. Let go of the can. Hey. Let go of the can. Now, why did you have to go and do that, huh? Freedom of expression. Oh, yeah? Hey, put me down. I will scream rape. You start screaming, Picasso. Hm, you keeping busy, huh, Jess? Yeah, painting my truck. I though you'd be long gone by now. Same here. What's your excuse? One of the perks of the job. I see your canvases are improving, young lady. Nothing personal, but it means we don't have to clean it up. Yeah, well, somebody has to. Take it up with her mother. No more of this crap. I should have buried you a long time ago. Come on, Jesse. Let's go. You? It's great having you back, JJ. This is nuts. I'm going to tear your guts out, and then I'm going to crush you. Cutter? You sure do pick your spots, don't you? Look who's talking. Look, Jess, Sheriff Hodges is not going to keep doing us favors just because he's a friend. Whatever. What do you want from me? I want you to think about what you're doing. OK, all right. I want you to be responsible. Oh, yeah. Like hanging out at speed ways and partying and getting knocked up. Jess, I want you to do better than me, OK? Yeah, you wouldn't want me repeating your mistake. That's not what I said. Yes, it is. Sawyer. What's up? Do you mind opening your trailer for me, please? What for? Just open it. Great. Knock yourself out. I need you to do it. Anything in particular you're looking for? Yes, sir. A head. I'm just going to need you to stay right here. Robbery. He shows up, tries to stop it. Then they cut his head off, yeah. Unless they took the car to make us think a robbery. Then they meant to kill him. Yeah. Who'd have it out for Cliff? And want to cut off his limbs. Listen, I got Sawyer inside waiting. Good, thanks. She's going to take your statement. You mind telling me why I'm sitting here? You don't know? No, all I know is one of your deputies came sniffing around my truck looking for a head. It seems that Cliff has lost his. His head? Yeah, I hear you two had a real knockdown drag out. Yeah, yeah, but when I left, his head was firmly attached to his shoulders. You can ask Tammy. Does she know? She found the body. Oh my God, I got to see her. Not so fast. Come on, Tom. Now, why would I do that to Cliff? Why? Come on. You know the story, JJ. It's practically a legend around here. Yeah, well, in case you've forgotten, I'm the one that lived it. Now, if anybody was out for revenge after 17 years, it would be him. Not me. So Cliff wanted revenge. I said if. All he wanted was to show me his car. That is a real coincidence, wouldn't you say? Oh, yeah. Yeah, that'll be real neat, wouldn't it, Tom? Every legend needs it's bad guy. Well, I know you're a quitter and a loser. I just wondered how far you'd fallen. Sir. What you got, Ron? Besides the obvious? Yeah. Vehicle went over him post-mortem. You mean they cut his head off and then drove over him? Mm. Man, that's mean. Mhm. I make the time of death approximately 9:00 PM. 9 o'clock last night. Are you sure about that? Yeah, give or take. OK, thank you. What's wrong? Well, JJ was in our office at 9 o'clock last night. OK. What could I have learned from Cliff that I don't already know? That I didn't do it. I didn't kill him. I can't ask him that, but in my office you said I could learn something from Cliff. Would you care to be more specific? You can go. They sabotaged my car. Cliff and Cutter. That's what caused the accident. Cliff told me. That's why we got into it. Sounds a lot like a motive. I didn't do it. Go now. Well, there's something else. The car. What about it? It's crazy, but when Cliff showed me that car, it was like Cutter was still in it. Like he never left after the accident. You better get out of here. Now, I got you. You're never honest with me. You just say what you think I want to hear. How many of many of my dads do you have to kill anyway, huh? Tammy, it's JJ. Tammy. Say, what happened? They took his head, JJ. Now, Jesse's like a complete alien, and I don't know. I don't know. I mean, maybe this is it. This is where I lose her forever too, you know? No, don't say that. My family is breaking into a thousand pieces, JJ. And you are in the middle of it again. Why? I mean, why are you here? Why did you come back? Why? Why? Why, JJ? 39-2 to station. I'm in pursuit of a custom race car. No plates. Location is the Peacock Lumber Yard. Copy that. Who's ever driving that car is our prime suspect. I mean, we had a good marriage, mostly, I mean, until all his pain finally caught up with him. I think Cutter was Cliff's only gravity. Then he just started drinking more and more and obsessing on that car. Then all this stuff with Jesse. I just thought we were going to get through it, you know? Has it really been 17 years? Yep. And how about you? You tore yourself up with guilt, didn't you? You know, Tom Hodges thinks I did it. Your kid thinks I did it. Who would do something like this? How long has Cliff been working on that car? I don't know. A year, maybe. Why? Did he ever say anything to you about it, about anything that sounded maybe a little strange. No, he didn't say anything to me about it after I told him I wanted to see it crushed. Well, when he showed me the car, I got a weird feeling. Feeling? Like something was in it. Something like what? Like Cutter. Like he never left it. Like... like he was really pissed off. Like a ghost? And you think that this ghost is what killed Cliff? Might be. My god, you're insane. No, Tammy, come on. I... No, JJ, get out. Look, Tammy... JJ, get out. Oh. Yeah, I got a little hung up, Chuck. I'm on my way. On your way? You got to be here already. JJ, do I have to spell it out for you? Your job is riding on this. Yeah, not any clearer than you already have, man. Asshole. OK, OK, OK. Comfy up there? Crucify me later, dude. I seriously have to pee. Here, use this. Yeah, right. I just love burgers. You know, I could eat burgers every day. If I had to get a job, I'd get a job at Mickey D's just for the burgers. Yeah, well, finish it up quick. You know, I didn't expect you to dive off like that. Yeah, well, you could've said something. Yeah, and I could have emptied my bladder in your truck too, but I didn't. I was tempted. Hey, you know, I don't need this right now, kid. OK? I got enough problems of my own. If I don't get that car delivered on time, I'm going to be serving fries at Mickey D's. Just think of the discount. Call your mom. No way, I'm not going back there. Where do you think you're going? Well, I don't know. I could stay with you for a while. You know, just until I figure something else out. And how would that work exactly? Oh, right. I guess not with you killing my two dads and all. Look, your mom... My mom. Hey, listen to me. Your mom needs you right now. You're all she's got, and I'm taking you there. So let's go. No way... give me that. Hey, that is good stuff. Hey, just come on. Let's go. You know, you don't need to take me to wherever you're going, just drop me off at San Francisco or something. Get real. Come on. That was my dad's car, and there was no one in it. Just get in the truck. Call the state police. Let them know. Tom. I don't have time right now, Tammy. Jesse's missing. She never came home last night. I've already checked all the usual places, and, you know, she was so upset about Cliff, and... what? Do you know if she went off with Taz or Owen? Maybe, why? Because somebody found Taz this morning. He was dead. Owen? They're looking. No. But there's been no sign of Jesse, so she's probably still all right. Probably? We'll do everything we can to find her. You know that. But right now, I have a murder spree on my hands, and my only suspect has left town in the middle of the night. - JJ? - Yeah. You know, he was saying some really crazy things yesterday. I know what he said, and I should've locked him up when I had the chance. What if she's with him? Then we'll bring her back. I'm going with you. I don't think that would be a good idea. Tom Hodges, I'm going with you. I don't see it. It tried to kill us. Jess, we're safe inside this truck, OK? It can't get us in here. Oh, I'm freaking out right now. Yeah? Join the club. OK, there was no one driving the car. Whatever's in that car is after me, not you. Oh, yeah. It took out half the market trying to make us road kill, but it's only after you. Is that what happened to my dad? Oh, great. Frankencar, it's alive. You know, I liked it better when I thought you did it. The car is haunted, isn't it? How would I know? It's my first Frankencar too. Is it Cutter? I know he's my real dad. They told me. Is it him? I don't know what it is. I don't. Come on, everyone knows you two were like mortal enemies. It's just a story. I mean, it's something they cooked up just to hype the races. Really? Yeah, Cutter and me, we used to race around, you know, knock over a mailboxes, chase girls. I mean, all the stupid stuff guys do. Some guys. I mean, we did. Cutter and me, we were friends. Was he like you? Like me? Am I like him? No, you're like your mother. Ouch, right between the eyes. And you asked for it. Well, speaking of your mother. Well, this out to be good. What's going on? Get out, JJ. Hands behind your head, now. All right, take it easy, Tom. Up against the truck. Out of the way, Jesse. What? Up against the truck. What are you doing? Jesse. Hey, I was bringing her back, Tammy. It's not his fault. You're lucky you didn't harm her. We'd be doing this Old Testament style. You're making a mistake. Yeah? The only mistake I made was letting you walk away, you murdering psychopath. It was the car, Tom. Enough of the damn car. He's telling the truth. No, it was dad's car. It was his racer. I saw it, and it tried to kill us. Will you listen to her, Tammy? Stop it. He didn't do anything to me. - He didn't do anything wrong. - Jesse, stop it. Jesse. Stop it, let go of me. Let go of me. Hey, Tom. She's telling the truth. I'm telling you the truth. All right, let's do this. Get in. Tammy, Jessie, come on. Come on, let's go. Get in the truck. - No, we can't leave her. - Just get in the truck. Come on. I'm stuck. Pull my arm. OK, I'm going to get you out of there. I'm going to pull your other leg. Where'd it go? I don't know. It's gone. Again. Yeah, again. Look, I'm sorry I didn't believe you earlier. It's all right. I didn't believe me at first either. I mean, really? It was this car that killed Cliff? It's haunted, mom. Yeah, that's impossible. Duh, but this guy's too nice to say it even though he pretends to be a jerk face. That car is coming after him and everyone gets in its way. And what? It's haunted by Cutter? Why would he kill his own brother? Ghost, undead, evil. Look, the important thing is that we get somewhere safe, all right? I can't find my cellphone. Let me use yours. I don't have one. Well, I know you've got one. No, no, that privilege was recently suspended for unspecified reasons. Oh, you think maybe your behavior had something to with it? All right, all right. Hey, forget about the cell phone. Well, what about this? Breaker, breaker, 10-4. Give me that. Give me that. Breaker, breaker, we got an emergency situation. Anybody out there? Come back. Anybody out there? We're in the middle of nowhere. You shut up. You got all the lingo. You got all the moves, you know. You can have my job now that it's open. Oh, forget it. Who wants to drive a truck? Oh, you got something better? Anything. All right, go ahead. Name it. Oh, makeup. Makeup? You mean like selling lipstick? No, no, not what they sell at the malls. You know, like... like your fashion shows and shoots and stuff like that. Yeah, that's good. I hear they make good money. Yeah, they do. It's a serious profession. You know, there's lots of schools for it and stuff. Yeah, that's good. That's good. Whatever. You handled that well back there. She likes you. Well, no accounting for good taste. Look, I just learned more about my own kid in this truck than I have in the past year. You know, I caught her up there in the sleeper. She's got a lot of questions about her dad, but I was... I was good. I... you know... I made it sound like Cutter and I were good friends, and... Yeah, I didn't talk to her about Cutter much. It was just too hard. What about you? What about me? Do you have any questions? Questions about what? Well, maybe why I went with him and not you. Because you loved him more, right? No, are you kidding? Cutter was a mean guy. All he cared about was himself. I've had a long time to think about this. You were a good guy. Cocky, but you were better than most of them. I just couldn't handle it. Pretty lame, I know. So what did Cliff say to you? He said that you and Jesse kept him going. Why are we slowing down? Believe me, kid. It's not by choice. What do you think it is? I don't know, but it's not good. Now what? Now, I go check underneath. Well, I'm getting out. No. No, you're not. Oh, like sitting here's really going to stop a majorly pissed off ghost from getting its eternal revenge. Don't you guys watch movies? I got a life. You mean a truck, and some really smelly socks and a... Cool it, Jess. Look, you can get out but stay close to the truck. Yeah, keep your eyes peeled. That's all I'm saying. Well? I don't see anything. Transmission? Yeah, I'm afraid it might be. Figure it's toast? This baby's not going anywhere. Well, how about we just take a nice walk through the middle of nowhere, huh? Hello? You've got a race car in the back. You were never like her when you were her age. No, she gets the attitude from her dad. Probably be needing this. You know, she's just like her father. She's just like you JJ. What? I really screwed things up. So Jesse's mine? She's my kid? You know something, lady? Your timing sucks. You know that? Sucks. Yeah, well this might be the last chance I have to tell you. All right, Jesse, come on, let's go! Jesse! Jess! Let me go! Jess! Jesse! Jesse! Jesse! Jesse! Jess! Jess! Jess! Is she driving the car? No, she's not. I'm a little rusty. Hang on. No! No! Stop! Stop! Stop! This is what he wants, me chasing him one more time. But why? To get back at me for what happened. It was an accident. Yeah. It was an accident, wasn't it? There are no accidents, Tammy. What happened? What happened, JJ? He did something, didn't he? Cutter did... It doesn't matter right now. Well, yes, it does! No, all that matters is that we get our daughter back. What do you want from me? You're not my father! You are never my father! I hate you! You hear me? What if we don't catch it? We will. Where is it? No, no! I hate you! I hate... Let me out! You hear me? Let me out! Stop! Stop! He knew Jesse was yours. Stop! It's going home. We may have a shot here. How? There it is! Come on, faster! God, we're never going to catch them. Not like this. God, he's going to kill her. Not while I'm still on this Earth. Now what are you doing? What are you doing? Getting out. No... You gotta trust me on this. It's all right. Mom? I'm trapped! Help! I'm going to get you out of there, Jess! Kick it! Kick the windshield! Harder! Come on, kick it! JJ! Stay there. It's OK. Jesse? I'm OK, too. All right, what are we going to do? I got a plan. Oh, yeah, right. Here's the plan. I'm going to run as fast as I can. You get you and your mother out of here. Can you handle that? - Sure, sure. But what about you? I mean, that car won't stop for anything. That's what I'm counting on. Listen, you tell your mom I think she did a great job raising you. Three dead dads. That's got to be a record, right? That ain't going to happen. Go. Come on, you son of a bitch. Sweet! I thought I told you to get lost. So you really did have a plan. You did it! Yeah, this used to be my favorite hiding spot when I was a kid. Used to go skinny dipping right out there. OK, you know what? I have had enough horrors for today without adding that image. Yeah. OK, all right, now that we're all here, I have some questions. She knows. She knows? Don't look at me. Oh, yeah. Lots of questions. Yeah, well, you know, there's plenty of time for questions... Ah, no, uh-uh. You not getting off that easy. No! It can't! All right, get in the car. Get in the car! It'll never stop. It'll just keep coming and coming. It's pretty clear I'm the one he wants. I need you two away from me. I mean, we can't just leave you here, JJ. Yeah? What are you going to do to help me, Tammy? I mean, your ex-boyfriend is a freaking demon! And what are you going to do? You're just going to keep running, what, till you run out of gas? And then what? You got a better plan? Because if you do, I'm all ears. I mean, let's say he does get you. I mean, how do we know he's not going to keep coming after us? Right, because you think he only wants you. We need to find a place a car can't go. Jesse, that car drove out of the lake. Hey, she's got a point. I mean, that car may be haunted, but it's still a car. Dude, that car is alive. Yeah. So that means there's gotta be some way to kill it. Whoo-wee! Look at that! Don't get to meet a race car stopping around here. Whoo! It's nice. You folks in an accident or something? Yeah, you could say that. Is that yours over there? Yeah. Mind if I borrow the keys? What? Now. Or you're going to be sorry than you could possibly imagine. Look, mister. I think you folks might need some help. Give me the keys. Don't bother calling the Sheriff because he's already dead. You're going to get these back, I promise you. I'll go get a truck... JJ... ...and I want you to drive as far as you can, and then drive some more. JJ, how It doesn't matter. Just be safe, OK? Hey, hey hey, hey. It's OK. It's OK. You're tougher than all of us. No. Look, Jess, you know, I wasn't there for you growing up. But I can do this. You just have to let me, OK? Now go. Come on. Sorry I tagged your truck. Next time I'm pressing charges. Get in! Jerk-face. Hey! Not so fast, mister! OK? Now don't try anything funny. Wouldn't think of it. You said you shot the Sheriff? No. And I didn't shoot the deputy either. I said nothing funny! So why are you so bloody, huh? What happened to the Sheriff? I said, what happen to the Sheriff? All right, OK. Go! Oh, God. JJ, it's too late! - Great. Son of a bitch! Hey, run! Get out! What? Get going! Get going! You heard me! OK! Back, get back! - Jesse? - Yeah. You all right? I'm OK. I'm all right. No. No, no. It's impossible! Go on. Get back in the truck. Hey, how are you doing? How can we do it, huh? How could we just leave him like that? Baby, JJ's got a plan. You mean the plan that you did somewhere out there on the road? Hey, don't give up on him yet, OK? Like you did? Yeah, like I did. I like him, mom. So do I. It's OK. All right, old buddy. Catch me if you can. Come on. Oh, my God! Come on, you son of a bitch! Where did you go? Come on! Cutter. You made it. Longest 15 minutes of my life. Jesse? She's not here. She's safe. She's a great kid. She really is. You're ready for this? Because he's coming. You better believe it. I haven't seen that look in a long time. Come on, let's do this. Come on. JJ, there's something wrong! What are you doing? No! JJ, I don't know what's going on! I can't stop it! Don't get out. No, JJ! Don't do it! I got to do this! I got to end it! Yes! Ugh! Get off of my dad. Yeah. Right. I think it's over, guys. Anybody? - Uh. - No. No, thank you. Let's get out of here.
