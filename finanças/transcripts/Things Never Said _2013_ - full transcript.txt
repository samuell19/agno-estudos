But not the guilt you think, you low piece of shit." Kalindra, wake the fuck up. Hey. You were mumbling in your sleep. Which? Um, the blue. Blue? Okay, purple. The manager from sav-on really liked me other day, just called, said that the district manager wants to meet me. I think they're going to hire me. That's good, that's really good. Have a good interview. This bitch is married and you boned her anyway? Why? 'Cause I like her, bro. I fucking like her, man. All the shit that you find yourself in, why would you put yourself in the same situation you were in back in Philly? It's not the fucking same situation as chantelle in Philly. It's the same situation except now you're doing what was done to you! How does that make you feel? She's exactly what I need right now. No, what you need is a job and some common sense. Don't turn this into some love at first sight bullshit. Hey. Lots of construction? Hey, will. What goes on between you and your husband is none of my business, but he is my business, and you shouldn't be here. You told him I was married? And now he hates me. No, he doesn't hate you. He's my older brother, so he's trying to protect me, kalindra. He doesn't fuckin' hate you. Old girl, what's her name? Chantelle? Yeah. She must've really done a job on you more than you're letting on. I put chantelle's boyfriend in the hospital. That's why she won custody. I spent three and half years in jail. Jail? I threw her boyfriend, his name was Kevin, I threw his stupid ass off a balcony. Paralyzed him from the waist down. My god. And here I am trying to get it back. When did you get out? A week before I came here, and the worst part about it is that she wasn't even sleeping with the dude. Why did it happen? He thought that she was breaking up with him to get back with me. He came at me... He came at me with a gun. I lost my cool. Wow. Well, that's the past. You can start your life over now. I did, kalindra. And then along came this really pretty, bright, passionate poet. With the same fucking baggage. It scared the shit out of me. I thought I recognized you, kalindra. Hey, miss Leona. Hey, baby. I just stopped in to pick up some food on my way home from work. Yes, ma'am. Um, miss Leona is one of my mother's friends. And he is? I'm one of kalindra's friends. We met at a poetry reading, like a lounge. Yeah, he's helping me. We're actually going over some poetry, and he's kinda coaching me along. You a poet, kalindra? Yes, ma'am. Well, charlayne never told me about that. Well, she thinks it's just a phase. Well, if your mama don't know you, who does? Anyway, I gotta go. I'm here to pick up a to-go order. Okay, I'll check on that. Here you go. Good luck with your poetry, baby. Thank you, ma'am, I appreciate it. Definitely gonna hear about that? God, am I. Yeah. You tell your brother I won't my shithead husband anywhere near you. You tell your shithead husband that I can handle myself. I can see that. So you're sure you're not gonna run from me and this thing we got going 'cause old girl saw us? Well, it'll come to a natural end anyway, right? Everything comes to a natural end. The question is if the ending is gonna be good or bad. It's only a job interview, you don't have to let it ruin your entire night. This motherfucker tells me I don't have enough experience in the drugstore field. I'm like, experience? Managing is handling people and solving any problem that they have. It doesn't matter if you do it in a drugstore, pharmacy, footlocker, gas station, wherever. Did you tell him that? Come on, people never listen to what they don't want to hear. Well, sometimes you gotta speak up anyway. Well, maybe I can attach a poem to my appli-ca-tion-tion Because Ronnie is feeling depleted and de-fea-Ted not being the pro-per sort of man-a-ger. You can be such an asshole. Wow. See? You listened. Next time I'm in an interview, I will speak my piece. ♪ You know your boy got balls, right? Knockin' out fools smooth the fuck out. That's what I'm talkin' about. I bet his ass won't be late for work no more. Now he doesn't have a job. A job? He'll get another job. But he got his swag back like when we was in high school.

Pissin' on me because I want something better out of my life. Kalindra, everybody ain't shootin' for the stars like you. You just gotta accept that. You used to. And look at what fucking happened.

My mama been tellin' me I need even more lord than I did as a kid 'cause now I'm in a game of hide-and-go-seek with self. And I can't seem to remember where she hid. It's like I'm locked behind these thirty-two bars of this rhyme like I'm servin' a thirty-two year bid for my husband's crime. And he's still filthy! But I feel guilty! Like he done geppettoed the pinocchios outta my soul with blows to my nose. Now it's even hard to smell the Rose that are right underneath my toes and doctors suppose I done lost my mind like the scarecrow has scared crow, just cry at the beautiful death of a once beautiful love now photographed perfectly and framed in a chalk outline.

But every time I write them in stone, it's like I'm hurting them. I am a poetess, broken, flirtin' with a pen that don't even like my hand. I am a dilapidated wo-man, so whoa, man. Whoa. You gotta handle me with care. Can't you see I got empty rooms inside of here? And filled with dirt on my walls, though frantically and patiently I still sit next to a broken phone awaiting god's call. This poem wasn't written to be tall and handsome, but i'm admittin' that it's dark, full of callous fists that beat me and beat me and beat me until my heart split. So, if this here be woman's anonymous, hello, I am the wife of a piece of shit, and on the side I been datin' Satan and that motherfucker gotten me hatin' my life and gotten me thinkin' there's gotta be more to the stage than an encore of rage.

Was the question posed to me asked in your furtive glances when I dared to speak up asked after makin' love when we were supposed to be fuckin' and after fuckin' when we were supposed to be makin' forever. It was asked when you were relentless in your anger dead silent in your disappointment furious in you self hatred never really wanting an answer never cared what the answer was it was asked to throw me into a contemplative silence and it worked I was scared to answer scared I wouldn't have an answer 'who the fuck do you think you are' screamed in my face as your punches landed on my skin like a whip on a slave's back whispered between your sorrowful makeup cries of a abused child who became a gnarled man. Well, I wanna answer as a matter of fact, I am happy to answer your question I am me now, hold on because when I say that you get confused, it's understandable because when you tell someone who doesn't really know you the answer to the question is me they don't think of me, they think of the me they have created, only that's not the me I'm talkin' about I'm talkin' about the me you don't see, the me you take for granted, the me that doesn't even know it's me until I say 'yes, that's me' in all my motherfuckin' glory and all my fucked-up-ness and all the ways I have yet to understand bitch? Yeah, that's me selfish? That's me, too angry, bitter, loving, warm, tender, brilliant... all me so damn me that I don't know who me is 'cause I got so many mes wrapped up in me but I figured this shit out and I want the clock to go back I wanted to take you and me all the way back to the very first time you asked me that question to the very first time you were so fucking confused by my me that it wasn't really a question it was a condemnation, an accusation, a way of puttin' me in my place so go for it ask me who the fuck do you think you are, kalindra? Well, motherfucka, I'm glad you asked like yahweh, god formed from the word 'hayah': I am I am the Alpha and omega I am strong, I am weak I am kind and I am filled with the kind of love that you will never take away I am sick of your shit, so i'm gonna stop this date from ever becoming a relationship so you will never lay your hands on me and curse me and abuse me because you don't know who the fuck you are I am going to allow this back to the future moment to be so that I will never lose sight of the very simple but true fact that I am me That's who the fuck I am! When I realized why I thought I was writing poetry and why I wasn't really living was the same, things change. And I didn't need to get the approval I'd been seeking. I'd fooled myself into thinking I was expressing my problems in my poems. I was lying. I hadn't even told myself the problems. I took his abuse, but I accepted my own toward myself and I didn't need to. No one needs to. If where you are in life doesn't feel right in your heart, and if what's in your heart doesn't feel right in your life, you have to make yourself heard after you hear yourself. That wasn't taught to me. The women in my life never spoke the things that were in their hearts. Maybe they never spoke it because they were scared, not of their husbands, but where their lives would be if they were alone, if they decided not to bear the burden women are expected to willingly bear. Sometimes we focus too much on how we'll be seen and judged. And if we don't have people in our lives who won't harm us because of the hate they have for themselves, then life is pretty miserable. And who wants to lead a miserable life? So, I told myself, "before you write another word, find out who you are so this sort of thing never happens again." I think that if you are to be very true to yourself and listen, really listen to the things you never say, you won't have to be in this room or in a prison cell or in the jail of your own fears writing when the truth is waiting on you to just speak it. But you have to listen. You have to be quiet and listen, not to the garbage everybody puts into your soul, the things you fight every day just to make yourself feel worthy of walking this earth... You have to listen to your spirit.
