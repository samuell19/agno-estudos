The Exit of the Trains Part I: Statements and Testimonies On June 29th 1941, my husband Abramovici Herman was taken to the police station. He was put on the Death Train, where he died on the way to Podu Iloaiei. On the 29th of June, as I was going to my parents', I saw a Jewish newspaper boy. Mr. Păsărică was just coming out of the tobacconist's and called the boy to him. The boy came running, thinking the human monster wanted a newspaper. The beast took out a pistol and shot the poor child dead. On the morning of June 29th, returning home from the hospital where I had been mobilised as radiologist, I met a gang - two gendarmes, a sergeant and some Gypsy children with bats, led by a character I knew all too well, an errand man at the Alcohol Inspectorate, just across from my house. He came striding into our yard with a bat and yelled for the nine of us to come out. With a fearsome expression and mad eyes, he herded us out of the courtyard with the bat, hitting my niece and my nephew, whose mouth was bleeding, and hitting my brother in the nape. He didn't even let me lock the front door. The frothing beast herded us forward, to the delight of our neighbour, Judge Savel Mărgineanu, a notorious Fascist, and his family, gushing with joy that my mother, "the old filthy Jew", who hadn't left the house in years, was being herded with us. Father Hodoroabă, seeing us near the Anatomy Institute, showed he was powerless to help us, gesturing sadly. We were taken to Getler's yard, with dozens of other men and women. When our tormentors thought the convoy was complete, they took us to the police station yard, already full of other Jews. After hours of waiting, we women were allowed to go home. The men had to stay. Later, I would struggle in vain to get some news about them. None of the three men in my family ever came home again. My husband Moise Aizic was taken from our home on June 29th 1941, by a patrol of Romanians joined by a Maria Melinte from Iași. From the police station in Iași, he was put on the Death Train. He died on July 12th 1941, from the abuse he suffered on that train. The road to the station was littered with dozens of bodies. One man, probably wounded, was moaning. A Romanian soldier crushed his skull with the butt of his rifle, then said with satisfaction: "Now you'll be quiet, filthy Jew!" In the street, we were greeted with booing and threats by a crowd of hoodlums gathered around the station. On the way down to the station, the crowd lost control: Armed with whatever they could find - bats, broomsticks, barrel staves or tree branches - they started to hit us. This is how my husband died: On June 29th, the father of underage child Rose-Claire was put on the Death Train by the Iași Police and died in a wagon at Târgu Frumos on the 1st of July 1941. When we got to Ialomița, I was ill. At home, my older brother, my uncle Solomon Albin and his son were all gone. When the war started in 1941, my father's property in Iași hosted the Italian Consulate. We spent the night of June 28th-29th 1941 hiding from the bombs in the cellar of our neighbours, the Pacher-Zigmunds. All night long we heard gunshots and cannons. In the morning, the cleaning lady went out and told us a cannon was next to our house. Around 5 a.m., we saw Romanian soldiers in the street. Soon, a lieutenant and three soldiers came and took us all out. We were four families in all. He had us line up along the wall until other families were brought out, then marched us to the yard of the bakery across the street, to join other Jews from the neighbourhood. There were over 100 of us. Then another officer came and asked who owned the Italian Consulate building. The Consul was out of town and had left my father the keys. My father came forward and the officer told him they needed to search the building because someone had fired from the attic. The military had it surrounded. The officer, my father and some soldiers went up. Then, a voice from the attic said "We got him!" I thought they had caught the shooter, but they brought down my father and beat him bloody, claiming he had fired the shots. Then we were all sent to the police station. At 9 a.m., they let the women go and only kept the men. My mother and I couldn't bear to live in the empty house and went to a friend's by the police station. Around 3 p.m. they started to kill Jews on the streets and at the station. People said machine guns were set up in the surrounding houses to shoot the Jews at the police station. The executions continued all Sunday long and into the night. In the morning, the surviving Jewish men were loaded into the Death Train. My father was in it too. As they rode for 11 hours in closed wagons sprayed with calcium carbide, he was one of the dead. I saw Jews against a wall by St Spiridon Hospital. Pharmacist Marcusohn's family was among them. He was holding his daughter, 3 or 4 years old, who was shot with the rest. We were hit both by the escorting soldiers and by civilians on the streets. On the 29th of June 1941, Dumitru Rusu took my husband to the police station in Iași, where he was shot. My husband, Haim Apoteker, born in Iași în 1894, fell victim to the internal conflicts in town and the massacre on June 29th 1941. As we know, Jews were crowded into trains and sent out in wagons sealed airtight. My husband was in the one to Călărași, Ialomița County, and reached the destination still alive, but died soon after in the hospital there. The hospital announced his death by Certificate 318/1941. "There are no Jews here," I answered. I insisted that was the building of the Financial Bureau. Suddenly, my neighbour Argintaru Filip appeared. Searching the house, they found four more Jews and took them to the station to be loaded into the Death Train. The five of them - my husband Brandman Ștrul Aron, Argintaru Filip, Șor Mendel, Rubinstein Haim, and Simon Dulce - never returned, dying in gruesome torture. Filip Argintaru was in the same wagon. Very agitated, he kept repeating: "How could one die faster?" Mrs. Bercu's husband had some sugar cubes in his pocket, from his mother. Licking them kept him alive. After eight hours, the train reached Podu Iloaiei, 20 km from Iași. At the end of the ride, they took out the dead. They were many. The survivors dug holes, put them in facing down or up, and poured lime over them. The dead bodies were still warm. After a while, since it was a hot day, blood came gushing out of the bodies. They say there was a downpour that day, as if to wash away the blood. To this day, Filip Argintaru's daughters don't know how their father died nor what happened to their mother, Frida. They were sent to Israel with the other orphans. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband Aron Aron and our sons, Aron Ilie and Aron Gustav, were taken by policeman Băltaru to the station, where they were shot. On the 30th of June 1941, constable Bocancea entered our home and had us get dressed and follow him at gunpoint. My father and I showed him our white cards issued by the Police on June 29th 1941, but constable Bocancea tore them up, saying they are not valid. All our pleas were in vain. My mother, Janeta Aronovici, kneeled and kissed his hands and feet. Seeing all their appeals were useless, my father offered him 50.000 lei. Mr. Bocancea took the money and said, for that amount, he could leave alone the rest of the family, but that he had to take my father. He prevented my father from taking a bottle of water with him and took him to the station. My mother cried in the doorway seeing Mr. Bocancea hit my father with his pistol over the head. Days later, railway employees told me he had been killed at the station. The train took his dead body to Podu Iloaiei. On the 29th of June 1941, an armed crowd took him to the police station in Iași, where we lived at the time. He was put on the Death Train and suffocated to death at Podu Iloaiei, where he is buried. We heard shouting in the streets. It turned out Dr. Averbuch, also arrested that morning, but released by the police, was being beaten by the servant's husband who was chasing him on the street, throwing stones. Dr. Averbuch took refuge in our building, up at the Lehrers'. Around 3 o'clock, Brădățeanu warned me again not to let outsiders into the building. I told him I couldn't help it if the Averbuchs were visiting the Lehrers. He told me to ask them to leave, or he couldn't guarantee our safety, for the danger had not passed. I asked Schmirer and Zilberman to tell Dr. Averbuch it was safer to leave through the basement and seek shelter elsewhere, as everyone had seen him come in. For some reason, though, he refused. Around 4, we heard the air raid siren and took shelter in the basement, taking with us Dr. Averbuch and the German who had brought the Silbermans' daughter home. The German stayed until 5. Shortly after, Raul Schnurer went up, saying he couldn't bear staying in. Hearing him talk to someone upstairs, we went up to see who it was. The doctor alone stayed behind. Three German soldiers with rifles and a Romanian sergeant with a pistol said all Jewish men were to be taken to the police station for ID checks. Engineer Schnurer and his father were taken aside. I tried to intervene for Zilberman, saying he had a certificate from the Germans. They barked at me to stay out. Asked what he was, Jacques Lehrer produced a Romanian officer's certificate. They believed him, and he ran upstairs with his wife and daughter, leaving us with the soldiers. They asked about other Jewish men in the building. One was about to go down to the basement. Mrs. Averbuch ran into my apartment, saying they'd kill us if we lied. Afraid of the consequences for all of us, knowing the Doctor was downstairs, I lost my head and said they could go and search. They found Dr. Averbuch in the basement, arrested him, and took him and the others away. Based on the petitioner's documents and our investigations, we certify that the petitioner's son, Bartfeld Ioil, died as follows: Assassinated by suffocation in the train evacuating Jews from Iași to Podu Iloaiei on the 30th of June 1941. My husband Baumel Litman was taken from home to the Iași police station, and suffocated on the Death Train at Podu Iloaiei, Iași County, where he was buried. My husband Beltzer Ițic was taken from home on the 29th of June 1941, taken with others to the Iași police station, savagely beaten and shot to death. The first bullet hit my daughter, Bela Felix, in her right leg. She was 18. Running to help her, I was shot in the right arm, which never fully recovered. My husband was taken from the shelter with our son Alfred Felix, 15, taken to the police station and loaded into the Death Train to an unknown destination. I was told the boy died in his father's arms the next day and my husband died the day after. My son Bercovici Hascal was taken from home on June 29th 1941 to the Iași police station on June 30th, put on the train with Jewish evacuees to Târgu Frumos, dying and being buried in Târgu Frumos, Iași County. On the 29th of June 1941, we were all taken from our homes to the police station. On the way we were badly abused by Romanians following our convoy. Some fainted in the street. I wasn't allowed to stop for a sip of water, though everyone begged them to treat me mercifully. At the station I was badly abused and Romanians took my money and jewellery, worth over 800.000 lei. I returned to find my home devastated and robbed and my husband and son were taken to the camp in Ialomița. My husband suffocated en route and was taken out at Târgu Frumos. My son was shot in both legs and in Ialomița, though badly injured, had to do field labour. He laid sick in bed four months. On June 29th 1941, the day of the pogrom, I was hiding in the cellar from the Romanian soldiers who took Jews to their deaths. Finding the house empty, they came for us downstairs. After taking our brother David, who died on the train to Podu Iloaiei, the soldiers stole two suitcases containing all our dowry, mine and my sister Debora's. On the 29th of June, our son was taken from home, beaten, herded to the Iași police station, and put on the Death Train to Podu Iloaiei where he suffocated to death for lack of water and air. Though my son David died on June 30th 1941 on the train to Podu Iloaiei, I was forced to pay military tax for him. To afford it, I had to sell a Singer sewing machine for almost nothing to pay 14.000 lei in military tax. In 1941, the war brought tragedy to my family. On June 29th I was taken from home with my husband, our son Berel Blank, pharmacist, his wife, and our daughter and her fiancé. We women were badly beaten over the head in the station yard, then sent home all bloody. The men stayed and were beaten worse. My son had two wounds to the head and fainted from blood loss. They were put in sealed cattle wagons, 120 in each, and moved around on the Târgu Frumos line to Ialomița. My son died at Mircești, after losing his mind. My husband survived, not knowing our son had died, and, after three days of torture, reached Ialomița a sick man. He returned after 6 months of suffering and illness and a year later the Iași police deported him to Transnistria for asking to be repatriated, since he had lost his business in Iași, on September 9th 1942. In Tiraspol he was stripped naked, robbed and executed. Such a cruel execution! He was burned alive with other fellow sufferers. My daughter's fiancé was shot as he bent to drink some water. Thus ends my family's tragedy, which left me a miserable woman with a crushed soul. On the 29th of June 1941, Blau Moise Haim was taken from his home to the police station. He died of suffocation and thirst on the death train to Târgu Frumos. We have reason to believe suspect Vasile Mîndru had a hand in the shooting of engineer Blau, his former colleague, killed with his whole family of eight. There are no surviving witnesses, as no one else lived in the house. We believe the suspect was also involved in the Sidoli Cinema murders in Iași, on June 29th 1941. On the 29th of June 1941, at 6 a.m., a constable and a soldier took us to the National Highschool. My son and I were let go. My husband never came back, suffocating to death on June 30th 1941 on the Death Train to Podu Iloaiei, where he was taken out and buried. My husband died in the following circumstances: He and other Jews were taken from their homes to the Iași police station, where he was shot on the day of the pogrom, June 29th 1941. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband Braunstein Solomon was taken from home by a Romanian patrol and shot at the police station. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband was taken from home to the police station. That day, when the massacre began at the order of the Romanian and German military, he was shot to death. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband Bron Samuil "Brauner" was taken from home with our three sons. badly beaten over the head at the police station, then taken to the Iași train station, where he died in a wagon taking Jews to Ialomița. As we were waiting to be loaded into the train, the Romanian and German soldiers guarding us kept mocking us. To make fun of us, a Romanian soldier started to imitate how Jews talk to Romanian maids: "Git that coffee, han't you hoid me?" All this, after over 36 hours of torment. Brucăr Șmil "Saim" Samuel died in the following circumstances: assassinated by asphyxiation on the train carrying Jews evacuees to Podu Iloaiei on the 30th of June 1941. After the servant left, an armed hooligan came and ordered us to follow him to the police station. The courtyard was chock-full. There was almost no place to stand, let alone move. We were sweating in the hot, suffocating summer weather, both for terror and for the heat. In the crowd I saw attorney Altain, who, beaten by thugs, had a deep wound on his head. To protect it, he was wearing a hat, despite the heat. We were kept there for an hour, then the order came to let women and children go. Going out, I saw a boy aged 10 or 11, carrying a smaller child, being pushed back with blows, as he was too old to go. On my way home, I saw more convoys of Jews, which included women and children. I went home to meet with my husband. Around 2 p.m., two sergeants came and took my husband and the other men to the station again. Of the 11 men who left, 10 came back. One, my husband, never did. Petrică Bogdan, my husband's associate, did not come to the aid of my husband, but sent a Romanian to ask me for the records. In my confusion, I also gave him a suitcase with silverware. I asked that elderly man to come to the station and claim I was his daughter, to save my husband, his son, and my brother, but he answered in horror: "Impossible, Madam!" "Gruesome things are happening there. They clobber people, they shoot them." "Hide, save yourself!" So he refused. That Monday morning, on the 30th of June 1941, any men left alive were taken to the station and put on the Death Train I spoke of. Each wagon, carrying over 100 people, was sealed with lead and sent to Călărași, Ialomița County. My brother, who had the fortune to survive, told me my husband died on Wednesday, and his son died on Tuesday evening. June 29th 1941, the day of the pogrom. I was taken, with my husband and two sons, only one of which survived and was kept in the camp at Podu Iloaiei until November 1941. Then he was sent to hard labour for three years in a row. The cruel treatment led to his death, just before the liberation, on August 20th 1944. My third son, who was in the Târgu Jiu camp until 1941, was then sent to Vapniarka, Transnistria, and only returned on August 25th 1944. I spent the years of Fascist terror alone, surviving by selling household items and my dead husband and son's clothes. I will not dwell on those years of mental and physical hardships. Anyone could imagine how I lived. On the 29th of June 1941, several Christians dragged from our home my husband and two sons, aged 18 and 20, beat them and took them to the police station, Then they were put on the trains going to the camps. Survivors told me they suffocated to death. I was left with a 16-year old daughter, barely surviving from other people's mercy and selling what I had left from my husband and sons. The driver, Gavrilovici, came at us like a beast. Now he is a driver at the Ministry of Communications. He started to hit us all with the stock of his rifle, then herded us, all bloody, to the police station. Before that, my late husband, who had known him a long time, kneeled before him, begging for our lives. He answered: "I must shoot you: Last night you shot at the Romanian military." From the police station, at 10 a.m., the children and I were allowed to go and my husband stayed there, where he was shot to death. On the way there, Gavilovici Constantin also hit my brother, Canner Ștrul, with an iron bar. But he only died later, in the police station yard, after we were separated. From home, he was taken to the station and suffocated in the Death Train. His body was taken out and buried at Podu Iloaiei. My husband was taken from home on June 29th 1941, taken to the police, then the train station, and put on the train taking Jews to Podu Iloaiei. He died from the lack of air and water and was buried in the Podu Iloaiei Jewish cemetery. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband Heiner Caufman was taken from home by Romanian and German troops and shot to death at the police station. My husband Ceaușu Șmil was shot on the morning of June 30th 1941, in the Jewish cemetery, by a Romanian patrol. On the 29th of June 1941, my son, Cernea Herman, was taken to the police station by a German patrol. On the 30th of June 1941 he was put on the Death Train and suffocated to death on the way to Podu Iloaiei. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband was taken, abused and killed in the courtyard of the police station. My beloved children, Avram Moise and Lazăr Copolovici, were kept at the police station on the 29th of June 1941, tortured, put in wagons, sent to Podu Iloaiei, Iași County, and, being later found dead in their wagon, were buried with 1.200 other Jews from Iași. Copolovici Lazăr, letter C, no. 56. Copolovici Avram Moise, letter C, no. 57. On the 29th of June 1941, military and police agents took my husband to the police station in a convoy. That same day, he was put on the Death Train, and died from abuse and suffocation on the way to Podu Iloaiei. On the 29th of June 1941, Ion Staicu and Dumitru Rusu came to our home and took my husband, Nusem Șmil Croitoru, and our two sons, aged 16 and 14. They went to the police station, then were put in wagons to Podu Iloaiei. My husband and both sons died on the way. I take full legal responsibility for my statement above and sign it myself, Coitoru Șmil Nehama. On the day of the pogrom, June 29th 1941, my husband Iosub Herș Croitoru was taken by military to the police station and badly abused there. He died in the Death Train, from lack of air and water. His body was buried at Podu Iloaiei in a mass grave. This is how our son died: on July 1st 1941, on the train near Târgu Frumos, of suffocation. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband Croitoru Aron Moise and my son Croitoru Bercu were taken to the police station and then by train to Podu Iloaiei. He died of suffocation and was taken out. My husband died as follows: suffocated on the Death Train on the way to Târgu Frumos. My husband Noeh Dascălu was taken from our home at Smârdan St., on the 29th of June 1941, beaten and trampled all the way to the police station. He spent the whole day of the 29th there, with no food, forced to lie face down. The next day, he was tortured all the way to the station, then put in overloaded cattle wagons, where he suffocated with other victims. My son Marcu Dascălu was taken together with his grandparents, both in their 70s. They were all savagely beaten. He was beaten all the way to the station, put in cattle wagons with 120 people each, and suffocated in there, after days with no fresh air and food. On the 29th of June 1941, our son Idel Nathan David was taken in a convoy to the Iași police station. The same day, he was put on the Death Train, where he died, being disembarked at Târgu Frumos on the 30th of June 1941. David Maier: on the 29th of June 1941, during the Iași pogrom, he was taken by military and civilians, with my son David Bernard, 16, and led to the police station. The next day, they were put in wagons with no air, food or water. They died of suffocation after two days, in Târgu Frumos, and were buried in the Jewish cemetery on the 1st of July 1941, when they were taken off the train, dead. My husband died in the following circumstances: on the 29th of June 1941, killed in the courtyard of the Iași police station. We hereby declare on faith to have known Elias Davidsohn, born in Iași in 1865 to parents David and Tauba Davidsohn and killed in the Iași pogrom in 1941. On the 29th of June 1941, he was taken from home to the Iași police station, where he was shot to death. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband Diamant Burăch was taken by a patrol to the police station, then put on the Death Train. On the way to Podu Iloaiei, he suffocated to death. People fought for their lives. 40 or 50 struggled for a tiny spot by a window or crack in the wagon. The strongest got it. Dozens of pairs of glassy eyes stared at him with pure hatred and, in moments, fell still forever. At best, death came easily, in the form of gradual sleepiness, fogging their mind. The body remained still until it eventually expired. But many, because of the scorching heat in the wagon, went mad before dying. Others, being more aware, jumped out the wagon window to be shot and spared a painful death. Others yet hanged themselves with their belts. When a survivor begged for water, the Romanian soldiers answered: "Poison!" On the 29th of June 1941 I was taken from home with my husband Haim Carol Drimer. He never returned from the police station. My house was devastated by thugs who threw us out that same day. They stole jewellery, cash, silver, clothing, linens and furs. The Committee for Romanianisation took my home and forced me to pay rent. My husband Eckstein Șmerl died suffocated on the train taking Jews from Iași to Podu Iloaiei, where he was buried. Victims in the declarant's family: Bart, father-in-law, Herman, brother-in-law, Ozias Egher, nephew, Mișu Egher, brother, Șmil Egher, brother, Șaie Egher, brother. Cause of death: killed at the police station. On Sunday at 10, the Germans came with Legionnaires Seserman and Indianu, constable Munteanu, cobbler Cucu and wagoner Turilă.

My husband Fatăl Leizer was taken to the Iași police station on the 29th of June 1941, then put on the Death Train to Târgu Frumos, in which he died of suffocation. He was dragged out of his home on the 29th of June 1941 by constables who took him to the Iași police station. He was put on the Death Train and died of asphyxiation in Târgu Frumos, where he was buried. I, the undersigned Felix Sura, residing at 54, Costache Negri St., hereby declare: On the 29th of June 1941, I was in Mr. Weisselberg's cellar. Mr. Miron, who was armed, came with Romanian and German soldiers and fired shots inside. Scared, we took the other exit, but he knew it and ran there. He got us all. The Mirons had always been treated well and welcome to use the cellar for shelter. We were badly beaten at the police station, my husband was sent with the "ghost train" and died in Călărași, and my son was shot in the station yard. My two daughters and I were badly beaten. My 11-year old girl took months to recover. On the way to the police station, civilians spat and threw stones at us. I recognised among them higher clerks I don't know by name, except for a Miron and his wife, who worked at the Iași Town Hall. I saw them guiding the Romanian patrols to houses where Jews lived. I think almost the entire Iași population took part in the pogrom in some way. It felt almost like a feast day for the civilians. At every step, civilians armed with guns or sticks were escorting Jews. The third day after the pogrom, I heard on the tram: "I killed six!", "I killed ten!" and other such conversations. My husband died in the following circumstances: On the 29th of June 1941 he was taken from his home in Iași, escorted to the police and put on the train evacuating Jews to Târgu Frumos, where he died on the 30th of June 1941. There were 140-150 men in each wagon. Normally, they couldn't have fit more than 35-40. Before sealing the door, they threw in something with a suffocating smell. They blocked up the windows and the Death Train started its gruesome ride. The pain, fear and exhaustion put me in a sort of lethargy. I'd have died in my sleep if my head hadn't happened to be by the door, which let in a little air. I don't know how long I lay there before being awoken by gunshots and a sharp pain in my leg. I saw a bloody bullet hole in my leg. I saw Dr. Max Aizicovici, shot full of bullets, lifeless. The cowardly shots fired at defenceless people also killed engineer Pulverman, attorney Gărcineanu and Iosef Lebel. We joined a larger convoy, with Călărașer Rebe in front, hands tied behind his back. We were joined by more convoys on our way to the police station, and Jews from the street were taken along, though they had permits, despite their pleas. Stepping over our brethren's bodies, grieving and tearful, seething with powerless hatred, we reached the police station. Among the thousands of people, bloodied, more dead than alive, mad with pain, we start recognising friends. Gherner, his big hat on his head, Altain in a bloody cap and overcoat, Solomon Kahane, pale, in his pyjamas, Șulimsohn, unconscious, and many others, taken as they were, beaten, subject to horrid torture, not knowing what would happen to them or their families. My husband Herș Gherner and my son Semy Gherner were taken from home on the 29th of June 1941, at 6 p.m., and led in a convoy to the Iași police station. There, my husband was injured with an iron bar to the head. He lost consciousness and died in the hospital. My son was killed on the spot. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband Glicman Moise David was taken by a Romanian patrol and led to the Iași police station. When they started massacring Jews in the courtyard, he was shot to death and buried in the Jewish cemetery in Iași on the 29th of June 1941. My husband died in the following circumstances: on the train evacuating Jews to Podu Iloaiei, of suffocation, in the pogrom of June 29th 1941. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband Goldenberg Avram went to get a free pass. He was badly beaten. He died from the blows and from being shot in the courtyard of the Iași police station. My husband disappeared in these circumstances: Arrested and taken to the Iași police station, he disappeared in the rebellion on the 29th of June 1941. I saw Onofrei, who now works at the Medical School in Iași, and Ciornei, who works at the Titan Nadrach Călan company, dragging Jews out of their homes. Through the keyhole, I saw them hitting Jews passing in convoys and making fun of them. A few days ago, Mrs. Goldenberg at 10, Rece St., told me the two came to her home on June 29th 1941 and her late son Lică gave them 40.000 lei to overlook their family. But they took the money and sent soldiers who took Lică and Lupu Goldenberg, who never returned. On June 29nd 1941, the day of the Iași massacre, I saw Onofrei enter the courtyard at no. 113. He took me, my wife, our maidservant and all our neighbours and gave us over to Romanian soldiers who took us all to the police station. As they gathered people, they hit them with an iron bar. Onofrei also forced out other Jewish families and sent them to the police station, such as Mr. Pincu Solomon of Dimitrov Street, Mrs. Goldenberg from Rece Street, and her son, who worked at the enterprise Engineer Goldenberg & Nacht. On the 29th of June 1941, Alecu Constantin from Iași, an apprentice cobbler, took my husband from home, with others armed with bats. In the men's absence, he tried to rob us. My husband died in the camp in Călărași, Ialomița. On Sunday, June 29th, at noon, pharmacist Veldt came and told us to go to the police station to get that cursed "free pass". Indeed, my dear father Blum Moritz and I, with neighbours Idel Goldner, Ciuraru Aron, Ciuraru Șmil and others, joined the convoy of 120 Jews on Pantelimon Street. We were threatened at gunpoint by constable Rusu, of average height, blonde, ruddy and fat, to lie face down. Whoever raised their head would be shot. He ordered us to line up two by two, hands raised. Dissenters were beaten with gunstocks by the Romanian soldiers and with sticks by wagoners from Târgu Cucului. In the police station courtyard, the Germans emptied our pockets: handkerchiefs, pocket knives, batteries, money. I was hit in the head with a bat. Dazed with pain, I couldn't tell the time when the German and Romanian soldiers started machinegunning us. The constables fired their pistols. People started to run, jumping over the fence to Sidoli Cinema. Terror reigned: to stay was to be shot dead. My poor father, who had a weak arm, died there. On Sunday, at 3 a.m., we heard machine guns. Several Jews were brought out with us in Saint Spiridon Square and shot. Mr. Goldner, the bookseller, lived across the square. A Romanian officer went in, there was a gunshot and Goldner was pulled out dead. My husband died in the following circumstances: in the pogrom of June 29th 1941, killed in Iași with my son, Ezra Goldner, 14. My husband Goldstein Albert was taken by a German-Romanian patrol, along with other Jews, on the 29th of June 1941. After being horribly abused at the Iași police station, he was put in an airtight wagon and sent to Târgu Frumos. He died on the train and was buried in Târgu Frumos. We were so many in the wagons, I couldn't tell they died until the bodies started to smell. It was hell. People lost their minds. A four-year old boy kept crying for 24 hours: "Mum, give me coffee, I'm hungry!" Some hooted like Tarzan; a shop owner yelled orders. I made a small hole in the wagon floor with a pocket knife. We took turns breathing a little fresh air. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband was put in a convoy to the police station, where he was abused and later executed with other Jews. On the 29th of June 1941, we were suddenly taken from home, not even allowed to lock up, and led to the police station. Then they let the women and children go home. Our son and I left; my husband never came back. We found the house ransacked, robbed of our best things: money, goods, jewellery, clothes, linen. On June 29th he was taken from home by a Romanian soldier and three thugs, tortured at the police station, then put on that fatal train and shot. My six children supported me until 1941. Suddenly, the 29th of June came and, for being Jews, we were all taken to the police station, and beaten there until three of my sons died, the youngest and liveliest, who were the wealthiest and had valuables on them. I was left almost a beggar, since my remaining two daughters and one son had their own families between 1941 and 1944 could barely feed themselves and their children, so they couldn't support me too. Please don't overlook the tears of a miserable mother. On the morning of June 29th 1941, a constable on Victor Place Street took me from home and a group of constables and soldiers led us to the police station. I don't know his name, but I saw him a few weeks ago, working for the police. At the police station I saw an inspector from the Home Defence Bureau whom I had served as a barber at Continental Hotel, two days before the massacre. He had come from Bucharest with three commissioners, whom I also shaved. We were escorted to the train station, made to lie face down, and, in groups of 158, put in wagons. Only 8 of our 158 reached Podu Iloaiei alive. We had no water and no air in the wagons sealed with lead, from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m., when we reached Podu Iloaiei. The 8 survivors from my wagon were thrown in a mud pit to drown. The dead were kept with the living until we arrived. My husband Iancu Grinberg was killed in the "ghost wagons" filled with Jews after the pogrom on June 29th 1941. Survivors told me he died near Roman and was buried there. As a housewife with two small children, I couldn't make a living. The crushing labour during the Fascist regime ruined my health and I had to have surgery which left me an invalid. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband was taken to the police station, then put on the "ghost train" to Podu Iloaiei and never came back. He had on him a man's gold watch, a woman's watch and gold rings. I was left alone, unable to support myself. My brothers Marcu, Solomon and Leon Grinberg from Păcurarilor Road were taken to the Iași police station, tortured and robbed of the money they had on them, then sent to the camp in the Death Train. They are buried in Podu Iloaiei. I am the poor orphan of a father killed savagely in the Iași pogrom of June 29th 1941. After all this time, I suffer to see my father's killers going free, or living comfortably in prisons without being tried. My husband died in the following circumstances: Taken to the police station on the 29th of June 1941, he suffocated to death on the train to Ialomița and was buried in Târgu Frumos. I was taken from my store by a police officer, a certain Adam, who has since died. First they robbed me of my documents and money. Adam also took my brothers, Grosman Itzik and Avram, and robbed them as well. Adam killed them as I watched. In the evening we were put on the train by Romanian and German soldiers. There were 150 people in my wagon. From Iași to Roman, it was never opened to take out the dead or give us water. My brother-in-law was killed on the 29th of June. The windows were broken, the children ran away. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband Grinberg Iosif Daniel was taken by Romanian soldiers to the police station, and put on the Death Train to Călărași, Ialomița. He suffocated in the wagon and was buried in Mircești, Roman County. During the Legionnaire regime, my only son, later killed in the pogrom on June 29th 1941, was arrested and tortured by the police. I paid Legionnaire police agents around 50.000 lei in bribes. On the 29th of June, my only son and my husband were killed and I was left with no home and no means, having to sell all my belongings. Shot on the first day of the Iași pogrom, June 26 1941: Evelina, 14 years old, Marcel, 12, Sedy, 10. On the 30th of June 1941, at 6 a.m., my husband was dragged from bed by four soldiers and on the Death Train to Podu Iloaiei suffocated to death. My husband was killed by a band of Legionnaires. He was badly beaten, our home was robbed. So were my father, a brother, a brother-in-law etc. Our store was robbed too. I fell ill from deprivation and suffering. We four sisters were widowed and orphaned. We still carry that pain with us. We will never forget. On the 29th of June, my husband was taken to the police station, beaten, then put on the death train to Târgu Frumos. He died of suffocation and was buried in Târgu Frumos. In the year 1941, month of June, day of 29th, a group entered our courtyard at 38, Barbu Lăutaru Street, including an armed German soldier and a boy from Tăetoarei Street. They asked if my husband was home. Seeing the soldier's gun and the boy's bat, I answered no. The boy came in to check. My husband was hiding, but the boy got him out. The children and I started crying, asking where they were taking him. A neighbour, Ion Munteanu, slapped me, pushed me back and said: "Your days are over!" I stayed there with the younger children. The older boys were working in town, two at Commission 5 and one at Commission 4. Two returned from the camp. I know nothing of the third. My husband never came back either. This is my statement, signed by thumbprint. What else is there to say, when my husband died on the train to Podu Iloaiei on 29.06.1941, and I, once a wealthy homemaker, was left in mental and financial ruin? My suffering has sickened and aged me beyond recognition. On the 29th of June, at 2 p.m., my husband and my son Herman Filip went to the police station to get a free pass. I learned they were put on the Death Train. My husband died near Podu Iloaiei, my son near Roman. On June 29th 1941, my husband Herșcovici Leon was taken to the police station and was shot there. On the 29th of June 1941, my son Herșcovici Moise was taken in a convoy to the Iași police station. That same day, he was put on the Death Train. He suffocated to death on the way to Podu Iloaiei, on June 30th 1941. My son Hirschensohn Carol was taken from home on June 29th 1941 by a Romanian and German military patrol and was shot at the police station. This is how my son died: He was taken to the police station by Romanian and German soldiers, and put on the Death Train, dying on the way to Podu Iloaiei. On the 29th of June 1941, at 6:30, two men in ragged clothes came, with two soldiers led by constable Păsărică, who, knowing most of the tenants, dragged them out, asked for their IDs and threatened us wives with a bat. The armed soldiers said our husbands were Communists and had to be shot. My husband Huberman Herșcu, his victim, started crying and told Păsărică he has documents to show he was on the front line in 1918 and was decorated for bravery, and certainly not a Communist. But the man herded them out beating them with the stock of his pistol. The next day, he asked me for money, claiming he was protecting them, and would give them the money before they were sent to the camp. But he beat my husband so bad he didn't even make it on the train. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband Iancu Mendel went to the police to get a free pass. On June 30th he was put on the Death Train and suffocated to death on the way to Târgu Frumos. On the 24th of June 1941, he was taken from his forced labour at the cemetery and executed with other Jews in the police station courtyard on the 30th of June 1941. On the 29th of June, my husband and two sons were taken in a convoy to the police station and never came back, leaving my daughters and I with no moral and financial support. My son died in these circumstances: He was taken on June 29th 1941 at 3 p.m. and killed in the pogrom in the police station courtyard. On the 29th of June 1941, at 1 p.m., my husband Ițicovici Iosub Leib was taken by a Romanian and German patrol and later shot at the police station. He was buried in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery in Iași. My husband Ițicovici Moise died on the 30th of June 1941, suffocating on the evacuee train to Podu Iloaiei. I personally knew late Lupu Iuster, who lived in Brăila, and know he was killed at the Iași police station on the 29th of June 1941, during the pogrom. I and other Jews were taken from home to the courtyard of the Iași police station, separated from our families and made to face the wall, being prohibited to speak. Near me I saw late Lupu Iuster, who was only passing through Iași. When many Jews had gathered, there was an air raid siren, and the machine guns in the courtyard started massacring the Jews there. In the horror-struck mayhem, some of us tried to take shelter. My neighbour Tili Eizikovici helped us over a fence, thus saving our lives. Of us 11 neighbours brought there, only three survived. After the massacre, sneaking through the courtyard, I saw Iuster's body in a ditch, peppered with bullets. My husband died in the following circumstances: Like most Jews, he was taken to the Iași police station on June 29th 1941, then put on the train to Podu Iloaiei, and suffocated to death. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband Kaiserman Noe and sons Carol and Iosef Kaiserman were taken to the police station by Romanian troops and were shot there. My husband Katz Kasriel suffocated to death on the train taking Jews to the camp at Podu Iloaiei on June 30th 1941, with many other Jews. My son died in these circumstances: On the 29th of June 1941, he was taken to the police station, then to Ialomița and suffocated to death on the 30th of June at Podu Iloaiei. It is my holy duty to recount the death of good man Lazăr Klughaupt, former treasurer of the Keren Kayemet in Iași. On the 29th of June at 6 p.m., Romanian and German patrols took my husband to the police station. He was shot to death in the courtyard there. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband Bercu Leib was taken to the police station, where he was shot. My husband Ioină Leiba, nicknamed Lupu Șerman, was forcibly taken to the Iași police station on the 29th of June 1941, by civilians and soldiers still unknown, then put on the death train to Ialomița, where he died from lack of air and water. He was taken out and buried at Târgu Frumos. Passing near water, in our thirst, most of us couldn't resist jumping out of the wagon window to drink. Most of them were shot by soldiers. I remember how a staff sergeant, aide to magistrate Triandaf, commander of the train, executed an 11-year old boy like this: As the child jumped out for water, he shot him in the leg. The boy fell, but kept begging: "Water, water!" The sergeant grabbed his legs, said "You want water? Drink your fill!" and kept his head under the water until he drowned, then let go of his body in the river. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband was taken by a band of thugs around 2 p.m., and died from the beating at the Iași police station. My son died in these circumstances: Taken from home on the 29th of June 1941, he was killed at the police station. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband and son were taken from home by police agents and evacuated by train. They died on the way, at Podu Iloaiei. On the 29th of June 1941, he was taken out of hiding and badly beaten at the police station, dying there on the same day. On the 29th of June 1941, near dawn, a Romanian patrol and one German soldier broke down the door of our pub and shot my husband three times. Three of my sons died in the wagons, of hunger and thirst. To this day, I know nothing of my son. A cousin of mine also died, Benu Marcovici, shop owner at 140, Brătianu Street, in the wagons sent to Podu Iloaiei. My husband Șaie Marcus and son Natan Marcus died of suffocation and thirst on the Death Train to Călărași. Buried in Călărași. Today, June 7th 1943, we conclude from the documents that her husband, David Mattes, was allowed to settle here as resident by Royal Decree 263/February 13th 1918. As he fought in the Romanian military as administrative staff sergeant, the Iași Administrative Court, by Decision 15/1941, put him, his wife and their two underage children in Category II. The wife shows that her husband and two sons died in Iași as part of the repression on June 29 1941. She annexes her marriage certificate and the three death certificates. Examining her request and the documents, this Commission determines that Mrs Bunie Leia Mattes does not qualify for the Jewish categories in Art. 3/b of Law 143/1943 and cannot be given Romanian statute. At 10 a.m. on the 29th of June 1941, he was taken to the police by unknown individuals, then put on the train taking Jews to Podu Iloaiei, where he died of suffocation and thirst on the 30th of June 1941. The body was buried in the cemetery in Podu Iloaiei, Iași County. On the 29th of June 1941, policemen from Iași put my husband on the Death Train. He suffocated to death in the wagon, at Târgu Frumos. On the 29th of June 1941, around 6 p.m., after we had been allowed to leave the police station, Constantin Gongu, courthouse registrar, and two public guardians took my husband back to the police station where he was shot by killers unknown. I saw Gongu Constantin, at the time courthouse registrar at Section 4, when he and a constable took Moise Segal, husband of Mrs. Șura Segal, who never came back. I heard Gongu say, as he was drinking wine, that he was the new owner of the man's house. He also took a boy from the house of Jew Zborover and the boy never came back. My husband was taken from home by soldiers, taken to the Iași police station and put on a wagon to Podu Iloaiei. He died from the lack of water and air and is buried at Podu Iloaiei. My husband died in the following circumstances: In the Iași pogrom on June 29th 1941, he was taken to the police station, where he was abused. The next day, June 30th 1941, he was put on the Death Train and died in the Iași train station. Others, having finished their own urine, asked others to urinate in their cupped hand so they could drink. Ițic Lupu's late son asked me for this favor, but I could not stoop to this horrid task. Only when he begged, saying it would save his life, did I half-heartedly obey this revolting request. My husband was a qualified tailor. My 23-year old son was a certified accountant. Both were taken from home, beaten, tortured, sent to the camp in Ialomița, and died on the way, in the pogrom. I was left alone, with no means to make a living. This is how my husband died: On the 29th of June 1941, he was taken to the Iași police station and shot. My husband was taken from home on the 29th of June 1941 and led, with other Jews, to the Iași police station, then put on the train to Podu Iloaiei, where he died from the heat and lack of air and water. He was taken out and buried at Podu Iloaiei on June 30th 1941. I declare that Popescu Constantin, residing at 9, Brândușa Street, during the rebellion of June 29th 1941, took me to the police station with my father Bercu Mihailovici and a brother, who died there. On the way he hit us with his gunstock and kept shouting "Keep your hands up!" Place of death: the train taking Jewish evacuees to Podu Iloaiei. My husband Idel Mihailovici was taken to the Iași police station on the 29th of June 1941, by Popovici from Vântu Street. He was shot when he tried to run, then put on the Death Train to Podu Iloaiei, where he died from lack of water and air. My husband died as follows: On Sunday, 29th of June 1941, 8 o'clock, he was taken to the police station and shot. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband was taken by citizens Valodi and Bădulescu, now arrested. He was put on the train to Târgu Frumos, where he was taken out dead. The train I was in travelled for eight days and nine nights to its destination in Călărași. At Roman, where we were taken out to bathe, we saw chalk writings on the wagons instigating to violence against Jews. I remember the following words: "These are the murderers who fired at the Romanian military!" My husband and 19-year old son were killed in the Iași pogrom of the 29th of June 1941, by Legionnaire Nazi gangs. My son Moscovici Kalman and I were taken from home on June 29th 1941, by Romanian policemen, and led to the police station. I was let go for being old, and he was shot to death with my other son in the police station courtyard. He died from the poor conditions in the train. On the 29th of June 1941, he was taken from home by strangers with my son Isac Nadler and taken with other Jews to the Iași police station, where they were badly beaten, then put on the Death Train to Podu Iloaiei where they both died of suffocation. My husband Nuță David was taken to the Iași police station on the 29th of June 1941, by Constantin Jerminschi of Păcurari Road, Iași, who worked at Distribuția, then put on the Death Train to Podu Iloaiei, where he died from lack of water and air. My husband died in these circumstances: taken to the police station, then put on the train to Podu Iloaiei, where he died. After four years of constant grief for me and my one orphaned son, I am once again pained by an event that surprised many peaceful townsmen: The police agents returned. Many of them have blood on their hands from that gruesome Sunday, and the town still bears the marks of that odious mass murder and the blood of the 12.000. I ask not for revenge for my husband, dragged away and put on the deadly wagons to Podu Iloaiei and Ialomița. I repeat, we do not ask for revenge. But human and divine justice should punish them for killing their fellow men. "Thou shalt not kill" - how noble! Did those who killed on that Sunday of June 29th consider this divine commandment? The hatred with which they killed makes us doubt it. Pardon this digression and take it as an introduction to the case of my husband, Harry Pulver, watchmaker. Sunday, the 29th, constable Bocancea broke down our door, entered our room with a gun to kill my husband. I gave him 500 lei so he wouldn't take me away, but he refused, so my husband gave him 1.500 lei to let me be. He showed him the free pass from the police, but Bocancea tore it, saying it was no good. My husband left with Bocancea and I never saw him again. Seeing Bocancea go free was like seeing my husband's dead body. Now I see him free again and I wonder why. Is it not time to punish the murders on June 29th 1941? With the utmost respect, Perla Pulver, pogrom widow. Moise Rapaport, my son, and Iosub Rapaport, my nephew, were taken by Romanian soldiers, killed by beating and suffocation in the wagons to the camp, and taken out at Roman, where their bodies still are. All four men in the picture, Solomon Klein, Ștrul Lupu, Max Perlof and Avram Rizel, as well as my neighbour Pincu, died on the Death Train. The family later learned that Avram Rizel tried to hide at the St. Teodor Church, whose priest was his friend. But the priest’s brother chased him away, threatening to hand him over to the police. My husband Rosenbaum Aurel was taken to the Iași police station on the 29th of June 1941, by civilians and soldiers still unknown. He was put on the death wagons to Ialomița and died on the way for lack of air and water. He was taken off and buried at Târgu Frumos. My son was taken from his grandmother's home on June 29th 1941 by a Romanian patrol that led him to the police station. He was put on the Death Train. He died for lack of air and water on the way to Podu Iloaiei, on June 30th 1941. I, my husband and our two sons, aged 27 and 31, lived in Iași, at 41 Lăpușneanu Street, at the date of the pogrom, June 29th 1941. Dumitru Dădârlat and his family lived just above us. We knew him to be very crooked, capable of any evil against his peers. On the afternoon of June 29th 1941, around 5, Romanian soldiers came in with two civilians, one of them doorman at Trianon Cinema, by breaking down the door. Dădârlat sent his servant to tell the patrol we were hidden inside. We were all escorted to the police station, where we were beaten. I, the only survivor, returned to find the house devastated and robbed by the doorman of Trianon Cinema and the employees at Mr. Dădârlat 's pub. What is more, after these bloody events, he put pressure on me, taking advantage of my dejection at the loss of my husband and two sons, forced me to sell him our bedroom furniture for 7.000 lei. I saw the husband and sons of Mrs. Rosenfeld, who lived below Dădârlat, taken out of hiding by a group of civilians and a German soldier. I was there with Dădârlat, in his warrant officer uniform, when Mrs. Rosenfeld asked Dumitru Dădârlat to intervene for her sons and husband. "What, so I'll get taken too?" Indeed, Dădârlat had a very malicious servant who denounced Jews hidden in the beer hall building. My husband died in the following circumstances: He was taken from home in the afternoon of June 29th 1941, by persons unknown, led to the Iași police station, sent to the camp on the Death Train to Călărași, Ialomița, and died on July 13th 1941. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband was doing forced labour at the plant. He was put on the Death Train to Podu Iloaiei. He died in the wagon for lack of air and water and was buried at Podu Iloaiei on June 30th 1941. My sons Avram and Bernard Rudich were taken from home on the 29th of June 1941, and led to the Iași police station. They and other Jews, in the conditions we all know, were sent to Podu Iloaiei in wagons sealed airtight. My sons died on the way and were buried at Podu Iloaiei. My husband Lupu Scheffler was taken from home by unknown soldiers and escorted to the Iași police station on the 29th of June 1941. He was killed in the police station courtyard. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband Schwarz Nuham was taken in a convoy with other Jews to the Iași police station, where he was shot to death in the courtyard. My husband Schwarzneider Meir was taken from home by a police agent and a German soldier on June 29th 1941, at 9 a.m., sent in a convoy to the Iași police station and killed there. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband was taken to the Iași police station but survived. That was in the morning. In the afternoon he was taken again by Romanian military, beaten and taken back there. Before him, they took our three sons, Aron, Haim, and Oscar. They were beaten by a Romanian patrol and sent in a convoy to the police station. My husband and two of the sons were killed, and the third, Haim, survived, but was sent to the camp in the Death Train. At Târgu Frumos he was taken out dead. 37 days after the rebellion, I returned home, after staying with a sister of mine. Some of our goods had been requisitioned as the police certified. The other goods and five machines had been stolen by Romanian military firefighters. I found Romanian soldiers in our store who chased me away. How my father was killed: On June 29th, at 6 a.m., he willingly went to work at Commission 4. He and 50 others there were taken to the train station, being beaten all the way by police agents, soldiers and civilians. They worked all day under the whip, and in the evening they were taken to the police station like cattle and beaten by German and Romanian soldiers. At 11 they were loaded into wagons. Neighbours returned from the camp told me of his horrible death, between Mircești and Hălăucești. The pain of his death will be with me forever. At the start of the war, on the 29th of June, my father and I were taken from home, beaten and led to the police station. German and Romanian soldiers and Legionnaire civilians were waiting to beat us by the entrance. We spent the day there, in the sound of gunshots. I lost my father in the crowd. He was taken in a convoy to the train station, put in a wagon with 150 people, bound for Călărași, Ialomița, with no air. He died as they were reaching Călărași. I was kept in the basement of the Iași police station for two days. Then I ran home and found the house robbed. When the war started, on the 29th of June 1941, my husband was killed in the wagons to Ialomița. I was left with five children and no means to support them. I could only sell all my husband had earned in 45 years of hard work. After gradually selling all we had in the house, I was left with no belongings and no way to earn a living. My children were young. The oldest, 15, couldn't work yet. Caught between the terror and our dire financial situation, those four years exhausted us. My husband Segall Herșcu was taken from home with our two sons, Segall Itzhak and Rudy, and led to the Iași police station on the 29th of June 1941 by civilians and soldiers. He died on the Death Train to Podu Iloaiei for lack of water and air. My son died in the pogrom in Iași on June 29th 1941. Circumstances of my husband's death: He was taken from forced labour at the electrical plant on the 29th of June 1941, beaten at the Iași police station and put on the Death Train to Podu Iloaiei where he died of suffocation. My son was dragged from our hiding place, taken to the police station, beaten again, and sent on the train to Podu Iloaiei, dying for lack of air and water. We lost our only son. Circumstances of my husband's death: Deported on the Death Train on the 29th of June 1941, he died in the wagon at Podu Iloaiei, for lack of water and air. A patrol knocked at Dr. Solomonovici and Dr. Manole's door. They ordered all men to come out and shot the doctors on the stairs outside. My husband died in these circumstances: Taken from home on Sunday, the 29th of June 1941, by three wagoners, he was taken to the police station, then put in a wagon and died on the Death Train, being buried at Podu Iloaiei. On June 29th, our son Marcel Spiegler was taken from home with other Jews and led in the convoy to the Iași police station, where he was killed the same day with blows to the head. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband Iancu Steinberg and my sons Marcel, 26, and Carol, 17, were taken by Romanian soldiers to the police station, where they were beaten and killed horribly. For four years I suffered morally and financially. My husband was a political prisoner in the camp. One son, Leon Sternin, was killed on June 29th 1941 at the Iași police station. The second son was put in those horrid wagons on the 30th of June. I was chased out of my house and savagely robbed. Our son Strauch Isac was taken to the Iași police station on the 29th of June 1941 by unknown soldiers, then put on the Death Train to Podu Iloaiei, where he died for lack of air and water and was taken out dead at Podu Iloaiei, where he is buried. My son Ștrul Iancu was taken from home by a police sergeant on the 29th of June 1941, and killed at the Iași police station. In June 1941 I had a colonial goods store called Smirnov, in Iași. The defendant Dominte Mihai was my errand boy. On the day of the massacre, during the air raid alarm, about 150 people took shelter in my basement. One of them was a neighbour, a Jew who was my friend. 15 people in the basement, knowing he was a Jew, and the defendant Dominte Mihai tried to shove him out of the basement. Seeing this, I told Dominte Mihai to let my Jewish customer be. But he only shoved him harder, swore at me and called me a "Jew lover". So I gave up, and Dominte with 14-15 other people dragged the Jew out to the Râpa Galbenă neighbourhood, where the Germans shot him. I did not witness the execution, but that evening I went to the neighbourhood I saw my client's body, shot in the back, if I remember well. I don't know who shot him. My husband was shot by soldiers on the 29th of June 1941. The gunshot wound caused his death on the 19th of July 1942. That same day, my son Iancu was put on the train and died on the 30th of June 1941 in Târgu Frumos. We decided to slit our wrists to die. I pried off the metal edge of my wallet, split it in three, slit my left wrist and fell unconscious. Later, I woke up when a madman bit my right hand. I must not have cut deep enough, or my blood was thick for lack of water. When I came to, it was light outside. A maddened young man had hanged himself from the window grate, which fell. I saw the poor boy dead. I was standing by the window shutter, which probably saved me. I found my father under a pile of bodies. I barely got him to wake up, with a little water I bought for 2.000 lei from a soldier guarding us. My father died on Thursday. His body was taken out at Mircești. On Wednesday, I bought from a soldier some water for a watch. The first sip burned my insides. It wasn't water, it was petrol. Costel Zimischi and other Legionnaires dragged my family out of our home. On the way to the police station, they kept beating my son, Turkișer Zalman, who died on the way. I was put on the second train to Podu Iloaiei Of the 150 people in my wagon, only six survived. On the 29th of June 1941, the defendants Laur Ioan, Andronic, and Velescu, with several gendarmes and a constable, threatened to shoot Moriț David Bernstein if he didn't open the door. The witness, knowing Andronic, asked what they wanted. Andronic said he should call him "The Executioner". Ioan Laur punched him twice, so hard that he lost two teeth. The 29th of June 1941 was a day of sadistic debauchery. From morning to night, they arrested Jews on the streets Brătianu, Vântu and Bascea, torturing and robbing them. Andronic, Popovici and Velescu handed over to the patrols Moise Șmil, Rechil Ițicovici, Gherner Meer Leib, Pascu Getler, Smadic Marcu and his son, who died on the train to Călărași, Leib Moise, Ulner Moise with his wife and children, Ițic Zilberman, etc. My husband Ulner Moise was taken from home on June 29th 1941, beaten savagely at the police station, and killed at the Iași train station. He is buried in the Iași Jewish cemetery. I have only requested a pension for my husband Ulner Moise, and not for my son Ulner Isac, also killed in the pogrom, who left behind his wife Ulner Leia and his underage child Ulner Iosif. My husband Isac Ulner was first taken to the Iași police station on the 29th of June 1941, beaten there, then taken to the train station with other Jews. Put in an airtight wagon, he suffocated to death on June 30th 1941, being buried at Podu Iloaiei, Iași County. On the 29th of June 1941, I was at my brother Avram Ușer at 14, Păcurari Street. We were dragged out, beaten and sent in a convoy to the police station. Passing by my house, I saw Petre Lercă and a Romanian soldier taking out my brother Iosub Ușer with his wife and children and my mother Ruhla Ușer. They were added to my convoy and herded under blows to the police station. I survived among the 140 deportees in my wagon to Podu Iloaiei. My two brothers died. Of the 140 people in my wagon going to the camp, only eight survived. For the deaths of my husband Iosub Ușer and my brother-in-law, I ask for retribution with tears in my eyes. On the 29th of June 1941, as the convoy was passing, they came with bats and dragged us out of our old home, taking us to the police station. My husband was killed; I was left with two small children. My brother-in-law Avram Ușer was taken with my husband Iosub. My husband owned a colonial goods store, but when they took us to the police station anti-Semite robbers took everything, and I was left with nothing. God only knows how I fed my innocent children these five years. I still suffer of heart disease caused by the beatings. Now I live with my mother-in-law, a widow of the 1916-1918 war. Two of her sons were suffocated on the trains during the pogrom. My husband Valdman Ștrul died of suffocation on the train to Călărași, and was buried at Târgu Frumos on the 2nd of July 1941. On the 29th of June 1941, around noon, soldiers and civilians entered my home and put us in a convoy, my husband and I and our three children. My husband Herșcu and my son Moise were beaten by unknown people who broke into our house like barbarians. In a convoy, I was herded with my husband and children to Târgu Cucului. A Romanian officer ordered women and children to be sent home. I took two of the children home. My husband and my son Moise went on to the police station. On my way home I saw Niță Constantin and several young men, leading a convoy of Jews to the police station. Among them I saw Riven Marcu, his head covered in blood. He told me Niță Constantin had hit him with a shovel over the head. The sight of him made me sick and I went on home. My husband was put in the wagons carrying Jews to the camp at Podu Iloaiei. He suffocated to death and was buried there. My son Moise Vătavu died in the same conditions. My husband Sin Ionil David Weinstein, nicknamed „Iancu”, was taken to the Iași police station by unknown civilians and soldiers on the 29th of June 1941, and put in the death wagons to Podu Iloaiei, dying for lack of water and air. He is buried at Podu Iloaiei. On the 29th of June 1941, my son Weinstock Iosif was taken from our home at 97, Vasile Lupu Street and led to the police station, then put on the train with other Jews to Podu Iloaiei. He died for lack of air and water and is buried at Podu Iloaiei. On the 29th of June 1941, the day of the pogrom, I was doing labour as a pharmacist at Caritatea Hospital in Iași. My wife and only son were with a relative at 19, Căpitan Păun Street, where there was a concrete air raid shelter. At 10 a.m., on the Sunday of June 29th 1941, a soldier and two civilians broke in and dragged out all seven men in the house, including my son. Hands up, they were taken to the police station. In the afternoon, they were shot at with machineguns and many died. All night they were forced at gunpoint to stay on the ground among the bodies. The next day, on Monday, at 4 a.m., they were taken barefoot to the train station and forced to lie down. Many who raised their heads were shot on the spot. As they were put on the death train, they were hit by Germans and Romanians with iron bars, wooden bats and gunstocks. Then they were piled up on top of one another. The crammed wagons with doors sealed airtight were sent on side tracks for hours. The carbide on the floor decomposed from their breath and urine and suffocated them. At 5 p.m., my son's wagon was opened at Podu Iloaiei. Only a few had survived. My son was among the dead. He is buried in a mass grave at Podu Iloaiei with 2.400 others. My son died in the following circumstances: He was taken on the 29th of June 1941 and led by a Romanian-German patrol to the Iași police station, where he was beaten. He was put on the barbaric death train with many other Jews, for racial reasons, and died there. Circumstances of death: pogrom in the main square, Iași, 1941. A Romanian patrol took my husband to the police station courtyard. He died on the Death Train from his wounds and lack of air and water, on the way to Târgu Frumos, on the 1st of July 1941. We hereby declare on faith to have known Wittner A. Idel, a travelling salesman for Ichil David at 32, Costache Negri Street, born in Iași on February 26th 1880, son of Moise and Haia Leia. I also knew Lazăr Wittner, an accountant for the Wechtel Brothers company, born in Iași on January 9th 1916, son of Idel and Reizla, and I know that during the pogrom on June 29th 1941 they were both taken from home to the police station, then put on the Death Train, and died from the wounds and lack of air and water at Târgu Frumos, both Idel A. Wittner and Lazăr Wittner, on the 1st of July 1942. My husband was taken from home by a German patrol and civilians, and led to the Iași police station, in whose courtyard he died from wounds, beatings and gunshots. I stayed in the police station courtyard from 7 a.m. until afternoon, when I was let go and my son, Samoil Zborover, was detained. I never saw him again. I learned he was deported in cattle wagons and died near Podu Iloaiei. Returning, I found my house devastated. I learned some of my belongings were in the house of my neighbour Gongu and other neighbours. On the 29th of June 1941, all my three sons were taken to the Iași police station, put on the Death Train to Podu Iloaiei, and died for lack of air and water. My husband Zeilic Beer Maier was taken on the 29th of June 1941, led to the police station and put on the infamous train. He died on the way to Roman and was buried in Mircești. That same day, my son Iosef was killed in the police station courtyard. I was left alone with three children and no support. My misfortune was all due to my Christian neighbours. They turned my husband in and he was killed at the police station. Circumstances of our son's death: Suffocated to death on the train with Jewish evacuees on the 29th of June 1941. My husband Zeilig Riven Lazăr was taken with my son Berman Zeilig and other neighbours, led to the police station, beaten, then sent on the Death Train to Podu Iloaiei, Iași County. He died of suffocation and the beatings at the police station. My husband Aron and my son Leon were taken from home by Mihai Petrescu, now hiding from the lawsuit I filed against him for theft, and a Romanian patrol. From the police station, they were sent to the Death Train. They died on the way to Podu Iloaiei for lack of air and water. On the 29th of June 1941, my husband Iancu Zingher was taken from home by civilians, led in a convoy to the police station and shot to death in the courtyard. Early on, when people died like flies in the train stopped in Târgu Frumos, I jumped out of the wagon to die sooner, hoping the soldiers would shoot me. But, realising what I wanted, they started to punch and trample me then left me for dead, after taking my money, jewellery and papers. I fainted with the pain. I woke up when two people dragged me, undressed me in a swamp and put me in a truck with dead bodies. I would have to write a lot to describe my suffering on the truck and in the cemetery, where someone tried to kill me with a wrench. By the cemetery gate there was a pile of bodies covered in burnt straw. Along the cemetery wall there was a long ditch full of bodies, some of them still moving or shaking, but unable to struggle. They were piled up as they fell, thrown from the truck like firewood. Then I was whipped by a commissioner for sitting down next to a machine gun. I was taken back to the train, forced to step over the unloaded bodies, piled higher than the wagon's threshold. The worst was that they refused to take out all the bodies, and us few survivors spent one day and one night with half a wagonload of bodies fermenting in the heat, with no water and no air, so that more people died, until the wagon was empty.
