I'll pick you up at 8:30. My mom has a date with that guy who owns the ham store. He seems nice. Wear something cute, okay? Okay. "Wear something cute" meant something very specific in Jennifer-speak. It meant I couldn't look like a total zero, but I couldn't upstage her either. I could expose my stomach, but never my cleavage. Tits were her trademark. Those jeans are hella low. I can almost see your front butt. It's a rock show. This is my rock look.

She'd probably make an exception ifyou were, like, a drummer who's also the lead singer. - Like Phil Collins. - Who's Phil Collins? Forget it. He's seminal, but whatever. Anyway, this singer guy, Jennifer says he's extra salty, so- Salty. Salty means beautiful. Well, then you must be soy sauce, babe. Jennifer's here. How do you know? Needy!

I mean, I'm a really good friend, but I was just so hungry. [ Coughing ] [ Coughs ] Ahmet. You made it out. [ Coughs ] Are you lost? Does your host family know you're alive? Does anyone know you're alive? You come with me. We're gonna sort all this out, okay? And ever since then, I just knew what I had to do to be strong. And when I'm full, like I am right now, I'm, like, unkillable. Like, I can do shit like this. Watch. [ Gasps ] It's really cool. Just watch. Look. It's, like, some X-Men shit, right? What do you mean, when you're full? What about my mom's Kia? Why were you covered in blood? You didn't even look human. You know, Needy, maybe you should talk to somebody about these... disturbing thoughts that you're having. We're all really concerned. Especially Chip. I think he may be having second thoughts about you. Leave. Come on, Needy. Let me stay the night. We can play boyfriend-girlfriend like we used to. What are you doing? Um, you said to leave. See you at school. We are gathered here to celebrate the life of Colin Gray, who was plucked from the prime of his youth— [ Sobbing ] Colin! Take me with you! I belong down there... in the darkness! No, Kevin. Those are just his earthly remains. He's among the dark angels ofthe realm now. Fly, Colin. Fly into the firmament. [ Sobbing Continues ] Colin wouldn't like this. [ Woman ] You think so? Yeah, you're right. I'm pretty sure my son wouldn't have liked being eaten by a fucking cannibal... and buried before his 1 8th birthday. Wow. You must have known him so well. Jill. By the time they found Colin in that godforsaken house, he looked like lasagna with teeth. I'd know. I had to identify the remains. My boy... is not in the realm ofthe undead. He is not flying around in the firmament... on magical wings of flame. He's in an overpriced rosewood box... that's headed six feet downtown. So... you can take your pain... and you can shove it up your asses, kids. I got the monopoly on pain. [ Needy Narrating ] They did a big memorial assembly for Colin at school. And we had to watch another presentation about curfews and the buddy system... and how to deal with grief. But nobody seemed to care anymore. Sorrow was last week's emotion. Sure, we all hoped this would be the last funeral, but I knew better. So I did some research. Paranormal research. "Offering a virgin to Satan." "Ifthe sacrifice is impure- Human and demonic relations"— "Destroying a demon. "Demons are weakest when hungry, but a blade to the heart is the surest way to kill the beast." Jennifer and I hadn't spoken since our encounter in my room. Actually, I hadn't really spoken to anyone. Hey. Just bought our formal tickets. Did you make reservations at the Cheesecake Factory? Chip, I can't go to the dance with you. What? Why? Look, just trust me. You shouldn't go at all. What are you talking about? Not here. What's going on? You're breaking up with me? Please, Chip! I just need to show you something. Is this aboutJennifer? Yes! But I promise you this is the last thing— Needy, I care about you. A lot. As a person, not just some girl I made love to for four minutes the other night. And I'm scared ofwhat's happening to you. You're acting really fucked up. Please just let me show you. [ Exhales ] Okay. Jennifer's evil. I know. No, I mean, she's actually evil. Not high-school evil. I've been through the occult section at the library five times. Our library has an occult section? Yeah, it's um— it's really small. Uh, you have to read this. "Demoni"— "Demonic transference." It's something that happens when you try to sacrifice a virgin to Satan... without using an actual virgin. The guys in the band tried to sacrifice her in the woods. But what they didn't know is that she hasn't been a virgin since junior high. It all makes sense now. Read this. "If the human sacrifice is impure, the result may still be attained, "but the demon will forever reside in the soul ofthe victim. She must forever feed on flesh to sustain the demon." - Okay. - She's eating boys! They, like, make her really pretty and glowy... and her hair looks amazing. And then when she's hungry, she's weak and cranky and ugly. I mean, like, ugly for her. Don't you get it? The dance. It'll be like an all-you-can-eat buffet. Needy, I think you need help. Oh, my God. You don't believe me. It's not that I don't believe you. I just don't believe this. God! This is a nightmare! Well, what about the dance? Who cares about the goddanged dance, Chip? I do. I ordered your corsage. It's an orchid. It was, like, $1 2. I'll be at the dance. I just need to keep an eye on Jennifer. Promise me you're not gonna go. Needy, I— I'm not your guy anymore?

[ Sighs ] Look, I think I know what's wrong with her. What? What is it? You know how Needy has been really upset since Colin Gray died? Mm-hmm. Well, it's notjust because he was, like, brutally murdered and stuff. I don't wanna say this! Say it. I hope everybody has had an opportunity... to consume some of the pecan sandies and Cran-Grape... that were so generously donated by the parents club. [ Applause ] Yeah! Needy and Colin were intimate. And by that... I mean they were porking on a semi-regular basis. No. She and Colin were doing things that you have never even heard of. Okay? Total varsity moves. [ Applause ] But the real treat is yet to come. We have some special guests this evening. I just can't believe that she would mess with your head like this. I care about you so much, Chip.

Huh? You could have anybody that you want, Jennifer. So... why Chip? Is itjust to tick me off? Or is it because you're just really insecure? I'm— I am not insecure, Needy. God, that's a joke. How could I ever be insecure? I was the Snowflake Queen. Yeah. Two years ago, when you were socially relevant. I am still socially relevant. And when you didn't need laxatives to stay skinny.

[ Exhales ] [ Sobbing ] I don't know who Needy Lesnicki is anymore. [ Sniffing ] I'm a different person now. A person who uses curse words and kicks orderlies... and sees things that aren't there. A very bad, very damaged person. But sometimes change can be good. For instance, most occult scholars don't know this, but ifyou're bitten by a demon and you live, you just might absorb some of the demon's abilities. You just might get lucky for once in your miserable life. [ Crash, Fence Rattling ] Where are you looking to go, young lady? East, towards Madison. Hop in my chariot. So, why are you headed east?
