[instrumental music] [dramatic music] [birds chirping] [keyboard keys clacking] [gasping] [birds chirping] [breathing heavily] [music continues] [both moaning] [intense music] [Lydia] Is the running helping? [Sonja] It's everything. It's keeping me grounded. [Lydia] That's positive. [Sonja moans] [Lydia] And the sex, how was it? [Sonja exhaling] [dramatic music] Can you give me one word? [Sonja] Guilty. [Lydia] Guilty, how? [Sonja] I like that it's just sex. And I like that it's a little dirty. [Lydia] And you feel guilty about that? [Sonja] No. I feel guilty about Jason. [panting] [Lydia] It's been six months since he left you. Moving on is healthy. You owe that to yourself. [Sonja] I got the papers this morning. [Lydia] Oh? [Sonja] I couldn't bring myself to sign them. [Lydia] Maybe there's still more you and I need to explore there. I think we should go back to weekly sessions. [Sonja moaning] [breathing heavily] [moaning] [breathing heavily] [continues moaning] [grunts] [groaning] [sighs] [bird screeching] [melancholic music] [Sonja sighs] I'm sorry. [Crying] [continues crying] [water running] So glad you got some sleep. - How was the flight? - [Robert] Long. We had a four hour delay out of Shanghai. Coffee's by the bed. I've gotta run. I've got press all morning for Melinda's book. - [Robert] You got this. - Welcome home. [kisses] I love you. [Robert] I love you too, honey. [Robert] What's the gross square footage? Fifty-one by forty-three. Roughly, twenty-two hundred. [Robert] And the wall between... Will this be a sliding glass? Yeah, it's a NanaWall. Accordion glass doors, thin metal frames. [Robert] Approved. One down, one to go. Someone took a souvenir. Tonight, pretend as if you don't know I'm comin' by. I may have borrowed a key. Be in bed by 9:00. What? My lawyer sent over the papers this morning. That's good, no? You're not going to sign 'em. Well, baby, we had a good run. You are amazing. Now I have to get in the car and think of all the dirty things I won't be doing to you. [pensive music] [music continues] [phone vibrating] This better be business. [Robert] It's definitely business. I'm at The Chiffon, Room 442. I need you to come over here naked and talk me through these floor plans. I'm being a good girl, remember? [Robert] Fine. If you won't come over, how about you lie down on your bed and slip off your panties? [sighing] You're killing me. [Robert] I think we both need a little closure. Text me when your panties are off. In bed. G-string on the floor. [phone chimes] Lie down on your stomach. I'm tying you up. First the right hand. And then the left. Tight. [breathing deeply] I whisper in your ear. I've got you. You're safe with me. Relax. I'm pulling up your skirt. I'm staring at your beautiful ass. I crawl on top of you. I'm holding your hips as I slip inside you. And then I stop. I pull out. Teasing you. Please don't make me beg. [phone chimes] [Robert] I'm tightening the belt around my neck. [dramatic music] Do you want me to continue? I'm waiting for you to tell me what to do. Yes. Please continue. [phone chimes] [Robert] One more notch. It's so tight, I can barely breathe. I slip back inside you. Deep, hard, faster, pounding. Ahh! I guess that's closure. [chuckles] [giggles] [pensive music] [chuckles] [door opens] [water running] [door opens] [door squeaks] Ma'am. I'm sorry to bother you so early. Do you know a Mr. Robert Wilson? Yes. There was an accident last night at the Chiffon Hotel. Ma'am, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but. Mr. Wilson was found dead. Are you Mr. Wilson's wife? Yes. Ma'am. How? Asphyxiation. He was strangled? It seems it was a, a sexual act, ma'am. But we can answer all of this better down at the station. If you just let me take you down. He was with someone? Self-induced asphyxiation. It appears he was alone. [somber music] [shuddering] [sniffles] [officer] Can I call someone for you? No. [sniffles] [sighs] I'll get my purse. Jay? I can't sign these. I can't give up on us. I want to make this work again. I couldn't sign mine either. Do you want to come in? Yeah. [somber music] [crying] [both laughing] [Jason] It's... Yeah. [laughing continues] Okay. - The cake fell. - Yep. - It rained. - Ah-huh. I have mascara down my face in all the photos. [chuckles] Yes. I forgot about that. [chuckles] Hey. Be here now. Be here now. [instrumental music] You wanna maybe be my wife again? I do. [somber music] Hey. It's just me. Brought coffee. I'm in the bedroom. [music continues] [sighing] [intense music] [door squeaking] [Jason] You didn't take anything down. That would have made it real. [Jason sighing] I want to get back to us. But I can't move back into this house. I just haven't been ready to leave her. [Jason] Huh. The yellow booties. [mellow music] What if we did a trial? - We go for a year. - Go where? I found a little cabin in Grey Lake for lease. - Totally secluded. - Move out of the city? Well, you can be back for meetings in an hour and a half. Is it crazy? Maybe. But if we don't like it, we can move back. Just you and me again against the world? All alone in the middle of the woods. Oh. Sounds like a romantic horror film. [both chuckle] [music continues] Too fast? No. No. It's good. - Yeah? - Mm-hm. But I do need to take it slowly. - I can do slow. - Okay. [both chuckle] [Jackie] Mia. Mia? You don't need to do any of this right now. I can assure you that everything will continue to run smoothly. R-Vestex is a well-oiled machine. Robert set it up that way. You're mourning. You should take as long as you need to grieve. Everyone will understand. - Do me a favor. - Anything. Don't presume to know what I can and can't handle. I'm not going to sit around and let my husband's legacy perish. Until I appoint a new CEO, everything runs through me. I'll come in next week to show face. - Understood. - And it's business as usual. Nothing changes. We move forward like nothing happened. Okay. Now, what's left? Uh... These are all the one-sheets of Robert's direct accounts. The full files are in the Dropbox I've sent you. And, uh, then there's this. - The remodel. - The conference room? Uh, and the lead offices. We're only at the beginning stage. Just working with the architect. I can put it on hold, or stop. Nothing changes. I think that was pretty clear. [phone ringing] Well, this is very official. Your work line? [Jackie] My name is Jackie Clarke. I work with Robert Wilson at R-Vestex. I'm sorry. I-I thought this was someone else. [Jackie] Your firm is working on a remodel for us, yes? Yes. [Jackie] Moving forward, I will be your point of contact on this project. - Are you kidding? - No. [Jackie] Oh, we have some changes we'd like to make on the conference room. Last time we met, Robert approved that room. [Jackie] I don't know what to tell you. We have notes. I'm going to send them over, and if you could implement them and get me new prints by Monday, that would be great. Absolutely. Oh, I-I should mention that my husband and I are moving out to Grey Lake. But I can be back in the city for any meetings. Good. I'll have HR reach out for your contact info. [line disconnects] What a dick. [solemn music] [birds chirping] [door opens] [music continues] [sighs] Looks just like the pictures. Well, thank God, 'cause it's a year lease. [Sonja chuckles] - Hey. - Hey. This is good for us. Fresh start. Be here now. Be here now. [mellow music] [thunderclap] [chuckles] Uh-oh. - It's like... Of course. - Yeah. Go, go, go. Of course. Of course. [Jason grunts] - Got it? - Yes. All right. [Jason laughing] [thunderclap] - Whoa! Okay. - [Sonja] Beautiful. Oh, babe. That goes upstairs. - Got it. - [Sonja] Thank you. [mellow music] [birds chirping] [door opens] [door shuts] [instrumental music on earphones] Oh. [music continues] [exhales] [Sonja sighing] Mm. [pensive music] Mm. [exhales] [music continues] [twigs snapping] [eerie music] [leaves rustling] [bird caws] [music continues] [sighing] I'm back. [Jason] How was it? [sighing] - It's amazing. - [Jason] Yeah? Ooh, yeah. - Hi. - Hey. [Jason sighs] You know that cottage down the road, after the bend? Mm, sort of. [Sonja sighs] There were suitcases inside and it looked new. - Mm-hm. - Seems strange. Why's that strange? Walter said it hasn't be rented since they built it. Mm. Well, Walter is also in his eighties and doesn't appear to be all there. [laughs] True. Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. [both sigh] I've got to back into the city tomorrow. The R-Vestex project. - No! - I know. I know. But I'm... I know, it's terrible timing. - But they needs hard copies. - Huh. Do you need anything from the house? No. Everything I need is right here. Mm. I was hoping for some time for you and I to officially reconnect. I know. Me too. - But it's one night. - Rrr. I'll be back Thursday afternoon. Or better yet we could start tonight. Hm. - Hm? - Sure. - Yeah? - Mm-hm. [both chuckle] [owl hooting] [suspenseful music] [mellow music] [Sonja gasps] I can't. I can't. Stop. Please. I can't. I'm sorry. I'm trying. What? Say it. I thought we were going to make this work. We are. I am. - Babe, I want to want you. - You don't want me? [sighing] No, that, that's not what I meant. You know the last time we made love? Can you just be a little more patient with me? A year. The last time... It was my birthday. Jay. You hated it. [mellow music] [Lydia] Sonja? You still there? [Sonja] Yes. [Lydia] What if you told him about Robert? [Sonja] We're just teetering right now. That would break us. [Lydia] You didn't do anything wrong. I think if you could release the guilt about being intimate with someone else, it would break down that barrier. Sonja? [sighing] [birds chirping] [Jason] Gettin' on the road? Yeah. Okay. We good? I wish I didn't have to leave. I know. I know. Go, go. Tomorrow night. We'll talk. Really talk. About everything. Okay. [solemn music] [door opens] [sighs] [suspenseful music] [crickets chirping] [car approaching] [handbrake clicks] [engine stops] [car door opens] [door shuts] [footsteps approaching] [keys jingle] [door creaking] Hello? [pensive music] [switch clicks] [music continues] Hello? [switch clicks] [instrumental music] [door creaking] [door creaking] [music continues] [thunderclap] [rain pattering] [switch clicks] [suspenseful music] [switch clicks] [hairdryer whirring] [rain pattering] [knocking on door] [knocking on door] [switch clicks] [switch clicks] [thunder rumbling] [pensive music] [rain pattering] [switch clicks] [knocking on door] [door squeaking] [knocking on door] [door opens] [door squeaks] [switch clicking] Oh! What the hell? I'm so sorry to bother you. I live at the cottage down the road. My heat and power went out. I couldn't even find my car keys. Um... Here, come in. [switch clicks] That must be freezing. [dramatic music] [sniffing] [music continues] [horn honking] Thank you. Janet, can I get this validated? Oh, certainly. I wanted to offer my condolences. Thank you. - Can I help you? - Yes, hi. Sonja Richards to see Jackie Clarke. Oh, yes. And you have the prints? Yeah. Give me a second. [sniffs] - [Janet] Okay, great. Follow me. - [Sonja] Okay. [pensive music] I wasn't sure if you'd heard the news. What news? There was an accident. A tragic accident. And Robert is no longer with us. What? A ca-car accident? When? I was just with him a few days ago. I don't have all the details. [dramatic music] [sighs] I'm sorry to have such a strong reaction. Robert and I have been working together for the past few months. And I've got to know him, so... This is quite shocking. So it was a car accident? [Jackie] It's been hard on everyone. Robert was quite well liked. I can see that. He was very sweet. [Sniffles] [Jackie] I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. Given his position in the firm, his wife has asked for discretion in sharing the news. Oh. I didn't know Robert was married. [music continues] [phone vibrates] [phone vibrates] [mellow music] [rain pattering] [pensive music] [Jason] I'm Jason, by the way. I'm Clare. It was probably a overloaded breaker. Excuse me? Yo-your, your power outage. It was probably a breaker that blew. I'm happy to take a look in the morning. Bummer. My place is freezing. [thunder rumbling] Ahem, well, you're, you're welcome to stay here tonight. I have... We have a... My-my wife and I have a guest room. [whispers] Oh. I hope I didn't wake her. Oh, no. She's in town till tomorrow. Probably smarter to stay here for the night. [pensive music] Cool. Let me show you the room. [Chuckles] [music continues] [door squeaks] I think you and Sonja are about the same size. Not exactly the way I imagined meeting my neighbors. [chuckles] Fair enough. I'll look in these boxes. Hey. I really can't thank you enough. This is beyond kind. You don't even know me. You look fairly normal. I think my odds of surviving the night are pretty solid. I'll be just down the hall if you need anything. - Just one more thing. - [Jason] Sure. Where do you keep your knives? [both laugh] Funny girl. 'Night. [mixer whirring] Morning. Hey. Sleep all right with all that thunder last night? Like a baby. So I'm guessing, it was a double-tapped breaker that killed your power. What's that mean? Just that it may keep going out if you don't fix it. Happy to take a look if you like. I'm going to take you up on that. Cool. I wanted to be a good guest. Where shall I put these? [Jason] Oh, my gosh. Thank you. Uh, I'll take 'em. Throw 'em in the wash. [phone vibrates] [pensive music] [Jason] Hey. You've reached Jason Turcott. Please leave a message. [beeps] Hey. It's me. Just thinkin' of you. [Jason] Okay. That should solve your problem. Bummer. Guess I won't be showing up to your door step at midnight. Ha-ha! I insist on making you guys dinner tonight. A thank you. You really don't have to do that. I'd really love to meet Sonja. Well, I'm sure she'd love to meet you too. But tonight's not a good night. She'll just be getting back. I won't take "no" for an answer. But I will take "maybe" for an answer. Check with her and see if she's up for it. I have a feeling you won't let me leave until I agree. Correct. Phone. - What? - Give me your phone. Now you've got my number. And I've got yours. [Jackie] Thank you for bringing these in. It's a better presentation to the team. [phone chimes] Oh, no. What is it? Uh, something came up. We have to push to tomorrow. Oh, I'm-I'm headed out of town tonight. But you've have the prints now. I can always Zoom in. No. We definitely need you there. The thing is I'm having some family issues at home that I really need to get back for. Why don't we keep this relationship just business? Yes. Of course. - I will be there. - Glad to hear it. [instrumental music] [phone ringing] Hey. Hey. I thought a lot about what you said when you left yesterday. You're right. We've breezed over the past and if we're going to make this work, we need to talk about it. Hey, where are you? [sighing] That's what I called to tell you. They need me back tomorrow. So, you're not coming home tonight? I felt like staying was the right move. You felt like staying was the right move? Or you are avoiding having a conversation? Jackie implied it would be bad if I wasn't there. [phone vibrating] [Jason] I'm getting a call. I guess we'll talk tomorrow. No... [phone vibrates] Am I cooking for one or for three? [Jason] I can't tonight. Tomorrow would be better. Sonja's said to work. Well, I've been roasting this chicken all day. It's falling off the bone. And I'm peeling potatoes as we speak. You're really more than welcome to come even if Sonja can't. [Jason] Yeah, well. Next week, we I repeat, falling off the bone. [pensive music] Okay. Arm twisted. I will see you at 7:00. [music continues] [mellow music] [phone chimes] [phone chimes] [Mia] Where'd you go on your honeymoon? - Lake Como. - Ooh. Nice. Sonja had a rich uncle who said, "Pick a place, kids." - That's on my bucket list. - Lake Como? - [Mia] No. Having a rich uncle. - Uh? [both laugh] Yes. Well, played. [Chuckles] - Okay. Next question. - Okay. Where'd you meet? College. Yeah. I chased her for over a year. And then after one night of getting drunk on cheap wine, we were inseparable. Oh, God. What did I say? No. Nothing. It's fine. It's better to talk about it. Your husband? Bob and I met our junior year. What kind of cancer was it? Pancreatic. Just swooped in and took over our lives. [sighs] It's... Thank you for letting me share. I just don't have an outlet. And it's been years since I've been touched. It's been a while for me too. But I thought you guys... Sohn and I hit a roadblock a couple years back. We lost a baby. Oh. I'm so sorry. She just, she just didn't want me to touch her anymore. Sex just made her feel the pain of losing Eve all over again. I do not know what I'm saying. - I am over sharing. - No. You carry a lot of pain. How do you cope? I just try to hold on to the good memories. Tell me one. [chuckles] [chuckles] The day she told me she was pregnant, she took this little pair of yellow booties, and served them to me on a plate with an egg. - [laughing] - Yeah. Yeah. Those are the memories I cling to. I, um... I, I can't. I, um... I'm-I'm I'm... We're, we're trying to make it work. This is my fault. I don't know what I was thinking. I just... Just, ah, chalk it up to too much wine. You're very kind. - I should go. - [Mia] Of course. Might be best if we didn't mention this dinner to Sonja. Maybe we could just run into each other for the first time on a walk. It's probably a good idea. [instrumental music] [knock on door] Sonja's gonna be here any minute. I washed her clothes and thought I should get them back to you. Of course. Thank you. That's very thoughtful of you. - I'm just a little on edge. - Understandable. But don't worry. It's our secret. You're safe. Thanks. [dramatic music] - Hey. - Hey. Everything okay? Just chopping some wood. [crickets chirping] [dramatic music] [music continues] [water running] [screaming] [dramatic music] [line ringing] [Jackie on phone] Hey, Mia. Where are we with the remodel? [Jackie] It's moving along. Sonja, the architect, was just here. Great. I'm looking forward to meeting her. [Jackie] Small speed bump. She and her husband are moving out to Grey Lake. Really? How nice for them. I think we can do most things remotely. But she can come into town whenever we need her. Please keep me updated on everything. - Will do. - [Mia] Just curious. Where are they moving to at the Grey? Not sure, but HR has her new contact info. [dramatic music] [birds chirping] [gasps] Oh, hi. [clears throat] Can I help you? I'm Clare, your new neighbor. Oh, of course. Hi. I'm Sonja. [suspenseful music] [screams] Of course. Hi. I'm Sonja. I'm just getting over a cold. Oh. Is that my toolbox? - I found it. - You found it? At the end of your driveway. Coffee's ready. Jay, this our new neighbor, Clare. Clare, this is my husband, Jason. Let me just grab that. A pleasure. Let me just get that. Thanks. Beautiful weather we're having this morning. Two nights ago was quite the storm. Well, it was really nice meeting you, Clare. But we were just about to have coffee. So... Jay! Ah, do you wanna join us? Sure. Why not? Okay. - Thank you. - Yeah. Follow me. [Sonja] You're our first guest. So what made you move out here? Just escaping city life. Us, too, pretty much. Careful, it's really hot. [screams] Oh! Oh! Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. That's okay. It's just an accident. It's alright. Um, I'll be right back. Whoo! I am so sorry. I think I'm just nervous. You are good. It was just an accident. [dramatic music] [sighs] The coffee's great. After all of that. How's your leg? Oh, it's fine. Jason mentioned he's headed into the city tonight. You should come over for dinner. I roasted a chicken yesterday and I always think the leftovers are better. Oh, that sounds tempting. She can't. She's got a deadline on a project. Sure. I could have dinner with you. Wow, Sonja, you make it seem like I'm forcing you to have dinner with me. Oh. Ah, no, I'm sorry. That is not what I meant. I would love to have dinner with you. [mellow music] [Jason] Give me a break! [Sonja] You were. [Sonja] You were so rude to that woman! [Jason] Y-you pull me in with all this "I wanna talk", "really talk," and then you go out of your way to do the exact opposite. And then you invite her in for coffee. I have a feeling that you don't really wanna talk! You wanna talk? Let's talk. What's on your mind? [Jason] What's on my mind? How about the fact that my wife cringes when I touch her? I do not cringe. [Jason] You tighten up and you pull away. Do you have any idea what that feels like to be so repulsive to my own wife? Can you just be patient? I have been patient, Sohn! I've been patient for years. Right up until the moment you walked out. - [Jason] I did you a favor! - Ohh! [Jason] I left so you could heal. Is that what you're telling yourself? You couldn't stand to look at me. Oh, my God. You still can't look at me. [engine starts] [crickets chirping] [crickets chirping] [instrumental music on speaker] [yelps] Oh, my God! It's okay. It's just me. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I knocked, but you didn't hear me. What are you doing here? I message you and said I had to work tonight. I texted you back that I would bring you dinner. I didn't get that text. Oh, shoot. I didn't press send. [kettle whistling] I'm so, so sorry. Ugh. I'm making a bad impression. First I spilled the coffee, and now this. Well, hopefully, this dinner will be apology enough. Plus a bottle of fantastic wine. This is really sweet of you. And it's looks delicious. But I can't take your wine. Don't be rude, Sohn. - I'm sorry? - It was a gift. You should take it and say thank you. Can I ask you something? Are you okay? What do you mean? I heard you arguing today when I left, or correction, I heard him yelling. He sounded angry, controlling, even. No, he I didn't send that message today on purpose. I came over here in case he was monitoring your messages. Oh, no, no. Not at all. We're fine. Just little marriage things. That's all. I appreciate your concern, but it is totally baseless. Woman to woman, I felt an obligation to reach out. Well, we're all good. Well, enjoy the wine. It's from Domaso. You know? Domaso? Lake Como. Your favorite place. [crickets chirping] [suspenseful music] [Sonja] Hey, Clare! [Mia] Sonja? What's wrong? Why did you say Lake Como is my favorite place? Because you picked it for your honeymoon. How do you know that? Jason must have mentioned it at coffee. Funny. I don't recall that coming up. Well, you weren't there the whole time, so you wouldn't know. Right. Well, have a good night. Be safe. [music continues] Did you tell Clare about our trip to Lake Como? [suspenseful music] [knocking on door] Just one more thing's still bothering me. Any idea why my guest room bed doesn't have sheets on it? I'll wait. Take your time. All right, you got me. My power went out the other night, so I went to your place for help. Jason answered the door. He was so sweet. He invited me in and suggested I spend the night. Really? I didn't want your first impression of me to be me coming over at night and meeting your husband in his boxers. So, you slept in my guest room and met my husband? When you came over the other morning to introduce yourself, you were faking it? - You both were pretending. - Don't be mad at him. It was my fault. I suggested we start with a clean slate. I asked Jay not to mention it to you. Jay? I would appreciate it if you didn't ask my husband to lie to me. We don't keep secrets from each other. Not even small ones? I think it's best if you give us some space. - [spits] - Oh! You disgust me, you hypocrite. I think it's best if you give us some space. "I think it's best if you give us some space." Well, I think it's best if you get off my porch. Watch yourself, Sohn. Oh! [dramatic music] [line ringing] [Jason on phone] Hey, you've reached Jason Turcott. Please leave a message. What time are you gonna be home? Apparently, we have a lot to talk about. [music continues] [panting] [Sonja] Jesus! What are you doing here? Were you stalking me earlier? No. Why did you run by my house? I was running like I do every morning. I have gone out of my way to be nice to you. Since Jay told me you've had a rough year. When did he tell you that? At dinner the other night. What dinner? I cooked him chicken. Well, you would know because you ate our leftovers. You're making this all up. Then how would I know about Lake Como, and you two losing Eve? The little yellow booties. You need to leave. I'm sorry to bring up sad memories. But I don't like to be called a liar. Get the hell off my property! Don't shoot the messenger. I just thought you might like to know what happened between us the other night. Nothing happened between you guys. It was just one kiss. You're right. Probably meant nothing. [suspenseful music] What are you burning? The guest room sheets. Anything you wanna tell me? You said you wanna make this work and you go over there and you kiss her? Whoa. Is that what she told you? You got a different story? - Yeah! She kissed me. - You kissed. Period. Sohn, she kissed me! I backed up, and I pulled away. Something that you would know about. Don't turn this around. You went over to her house for dinner, and if I could ever forgive the kiss. I can't forgive that you told her about Eve. I'm sorry. I, I screwed up. Look, I don't have a therapist to talk to... Then get one! But her, this stranger? Who, by the way, came over here to flaunt it in my face that my husband's been keeping secrets from me. You know, you're not so innocent either. I know about your affair. We were separated, so don't blame me for needing someone to hold. I don't see how we move forward from here. [leaves rustling] It's Clare. She's watching us. There's no one there. I see you, Clare! Clare! [dramatic music] What are you up to? [mellow music] [doorknob clicks] [suspenseful music] [music continues] [door creaks] [microwave beeping] Did you come over to borrow a cup of sugar? I came here to tell you to stay off my property. By breaking into mine? I know you were in the woods last night. I wanted to see how me kissing your husband affected you. Excuse me? It seems only fair, since you kissed mine. [dramatic music] You're Robert's wife? Mia Wilson. I'd say nice to meet you, but why lie? I'm, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry about everything. I had no idea. He said he and his girlfriend had just broken up. I didn't know. I swear. Listen, I would never sleep with a married man. And I'm so mad at him for not telling me. I feel awful. Mia, I'm just... - Shh, shh. - I'm so sorry. Shh. It's okay. I've got you. Do you know how Bob died? - A car accident? - Not exactly. "You're safe with me. Relax." I'm holding your hips as I slip inside you. And then I stop. I pull out. "Teasing you." You, "Please don't make me beg. I'm tightening the belt around my neck." "Do you want me to continue? I'm waiting for you to tell me what to do." You, "Yes. Please continue." "One more notch. It's so tight. I can barely breathe. I slip back inside you. Deep, hard, faster, pounding!" You, "I guess that's closure." Auto erotic asphyxiation. I had to Google it. This place... You... You followed me out here? What do you want? Only what's fair. So you kissed my husband. An eye for an eye? So astute. So we're even now? I think even is a stretch. You did have sex with my husband. You're not gonna have sex with Jason? Well, if you were truly sorry, I can't see why you would stand in the way of that. Jay's not gonna sleep with you. We'll see. I have a flight to Shreveport in a few hours. And you can't stay in my house. So get out! [intense music] [panting] - Where are you going? - I rented a trailer. Jay! Stop. Talk to me. I was just guessing that you had an affair. It wasn't until you confirmed it last night that I knew. This whole time I thought that it was me. But it was you, lying to me. That's what I wanna talk to you about. - It is too late. - L-listen to me. Listen, listen. Clare, she's not who you think she is. - Her real name is Mia. - Clare? Mia? What are you even talking about? This is about us and we're... over. Clearly, we've been over for years. Jay, wait! Please, talk to me. I'm gonna be back in an hour. I think it would be best if you stayed the night in town. After tonight, cabin's all yours. [engine starts] [Sonja] I knew this would happen. [Lydia] Calm down and walk me through it. [Sonja] He knows. He knows about Robert, and it's over. [Lydia] Where are you now? [Sonja] I came into town. [Lydia on phone] Why did you leave? I didn't know what to do. He couldn't look at my face anymore and I [shuddering] I could relate. Because... [knock on door] [Lydia on phone] It's okay. Take your time. Because I couldn't look at his face after we lost Eve. And that's why he left me. [knock on door] [man] I have delivery for Sonja Richards. Hang on a second. [suspenseful music] [grunts] [music continues] [Lydia on phone] Sonja? You still there? [grunting] [dramatic music] Oh, my God. She's not in Shreveport. [Lydia on phone] Sonja, what's going on? Jay. I gotta get to Jay. Keys. Keys, keys, keys. [Lydia on phone] Calm down and tell me what's going on. - [line ringing] - Pick up. Pick up. [line ringing] [Jason on phone] Hey, you've reached Jason Turcott. Please leave a message. Jay, call me back! Do not let Mia... Clare in the house, please. [intense music] Oh, God. What happened? Sonja's not here, is she? Ah, no, no. What happened to your face? I should have never come here that night. Clare, what happened to your face? I should have never told her about the kiss. She was just so angry and she caught me off guard. Sohn did this? I ruined everything. No. No, you didn't. I don't even know who she is anymore. Apparently, she was having an affair. [phone vibrating] Can I get you an icepack? Actually, what I could really use is a drink. [chuckles] I second that. - How's whiskey? - Perfect. Comin' up. [suspenseful music] [engine revving] You don't strike me as much of a whiskey drinker. One glass of whiskey is fine, two glasses always makes me want a third. [laughs] Well, no one's driving. I'll get it. [suspenseful music] Whoa. How many more are we having? - Wanna play a game? - What am I getting myself into? This is how I learned to drink. Three shots, back to back, blind. You're serious? Okay. Let's do it. Close your eyes. Ready? Probably not. One. Two. Three. Whoo! Ohh. [dramatic music] Let's go upstairs. [engine revving] Ohh, look at you. It has been a while. [music continues] What's that for? We're gonna play one more game. [engine revving] What are you doing? Relax. I've got you. [music continues] Jay! Where are you? [sighs] [suspenseful music] [floorboard creaking] Jay! Okay. Honey, I'm here. It's okay. What happened? Honey. Hello, Sohn. What did you do? You slept with him. Put the knife down. Why are you doing this? It was just supposed to be phone sex. I didn't think he was really doing any of... Oh, shut up. I'm so sick of hearing you talk. [gunshot] [gasps] It was just supposed to be phone sex. I didn't think he was really doing any of those things. Oh, shut up. I'm so sick of hearing you talk. Please don't do this. Now we'll be even. No![Gunshot] [grunting] Keep pressure on it. Stop! Don't move. Jay, you still with me? [Jason groans] Yeah. [dialing] [operator] 911, what is your emergency? My husband has just been shot by our neighbor. I'm at 178 Fairweather Lane, Grey Lake. [operator] Stay where you are. Officers are being dispatched. Hang in there, babe. Help is coming. What's it like to know that you weren't the last person your husband had sex with before he died? You're a sick person. Soon, we'll be even. - And you'll be going to jail. - No, I really won't. You see, you're the psychotic, emotional wife who shot her husband in a fit of rage. Nobody will believe you. Who are you talking to? You! I'm not here. I'm in Shreveport. I arrived on the 10:30 United flight this morning. My sister-in-law picked me up. Today was my late husband's wake. It was beautiful. His sister planned everything. Tomorrow, he will be laid to rest at Pine Valley Cemetery alongside is mother. I was so distraught after the wake, Candace dropped me off at my hotel room so I could be alone with my memories. Tomorrow, the family will have brunch before the service. I'm thinking of having the eggs Florentine. Your fingerprints are on the weapon! No. Your fingerprints are on the weapon. Not mine. Too bad there's no bullets left. You're lying. [siren wailing] Try me. [gun clicks] [siren wailing] She went that way! [officer] Ma'am. Put the gun down. - Where's the ambulance? - It's on its way. I need you to put the gun down so I can help you. She went down that trail. - Get down on your knees. - She just ran out of our house. Her name is Mia Wilson. I need you to get down on your knees. [intense music] I see you, Mia! [panting] [siren wails] [officer] Hold your position. Put your hands behind your head. Grey car. Louisiana plate, 5-2-9. Grey car. Grey. - Hands behind your head. - Okay. Okay, okay. Grey car. It's grey. [automated message] This is a collect call from the East Central Corrections Center. [Lydia on phone] How are you doing, Sonja? Tell me what happened. [Lydia on phone] Have you been eating? Lydia. Please. [Lydia] The judge deemed that maintaining power of attorney was not a civil liberty that you were entitled to given your current incarceration. [mellow music] When are they doing it? [Lydia] 8:00 p.m. tonight. I'm told that there's always a chance that after the tube is removed that he could still breathe on his own. No. It's over. It's all over. [mellow music] [keys clacking] [dramatic music] [Jackie] Thank you for taking my call. An internal audit of Q2 brought up a mysterious charge. A transaction on Robert's Amex from 19 days after his death. It was for a rental car in Shreveport. I called the rental company. The car was a grey sedan, Louisiana plates. Four-hundred and eighty-four miles on the odometer. Seems a bit excessive for a day rental. I'd appreciate if you kept this tip anonymous.
