Here Thank you Coffee, it's on me Coffee causes imflammation. I'm not used to it. Your bonus? Not bad! Tell me something, How reliable is your lead? We have been on this stake out for many days I've gotten less than 8 hours of sleep. Both of his parents are dead, he was raised by his grandmother He visits her every New Year's Eve This is the only road to his grandmother's house. Then why don't we just wait at his grandmother's house? Why wait here? Don;t you Hong Kongers know the saying "Beat the grass, and you scare away the snake"? Have you Mainland people ever heard "Time is golden"? Let me put it this way There is a reason why we are waiting here. I wouldn't expect you fron Hong Kong to understand. Harbin Speaking of our Dad, it's probably going to be his last New Year's Eve We should make the most of our time with him. Let's make a schedule Each day, one of us wil keep him company here. Sis ofcourse, we have to take turns. What reallu concerns us is how to deal with the medical bills. Especially with third brother here. I'd say to be fair, the six of us should share the cost evenly. However, everyone's financial situation is different. Sister, that is correct! Take my wife and I, selling sausages for a living Do you know how hard our business is? We can't even make the gas money back! Save it, alright! I'll cover half of the cost you guys cover the rest I agree with that! As for the shifts, you all should split the duty. I'm done here Wait third brother, don't leave just yet. I'm a government official I have to work during the holidays But big sister is different. You were laid off , hence always free. Same for you fourth brother, you work for yourself. And you little sister, you're a teacher and now it's the Winter Holidays Fifth brother, I also have a conflict You all know that Niannian is in Beijing right now. I have to go pick him up. I've already made arrangements It is hard on her having to take care of Niannian all by herself... Bis Sister, who here ism't having a hard time? If we stop selling sausages for one day, we will have no income! So you're choosing money over Dad? Don't you have lot's of free time? Yes, that's right. I work on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday night shifts. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I work on a night shift. But during the daytime, I have to sleep. But during the day, I have to sleep. Alright you're busy, all of you. Go ahead and stay busy. I've been taking care of Dad all on my own anyay I'm used to it now. Big Sister stay, what are we going to do with Dads apartment? Xiao Jingming, guess who I saw? Xiao Jingming. Doctor Zhang, thank God you finally picked up. Nana is about to have the baby Are you at the hospital? I'm on my way to the airport I have a family emergency. I need to go to Hainan. Go talk to Doctor Luo, she's on duty today. Sorry, I have another call coming in. Is he here? No He said today, Dr. Luo is on duty What? Dr. Zhang suggest we find Dr. Luo They say Dr. Luo is scary, I don't want her! Let's just get it over with, okay? He said she's really nice, don't worry. No! I dont want Luo, I want Zhang! Go find him! That's impossible. Let's just get it over with. Get it over with? This is too important Okay, calm down! Find Dr. Zhang Raise your legs, raise! Relax! It'll be fine, dont squeeze! About a month early right? Yes! 42 days. Is everything okay? The dilation is only one finger-width plus the baby is facing up. Caesarean or natural birth? I'm giving birth myself! So what should we do now? Wait! What are you looking at? This is a hospital, not a circus. Stop gawking, get out of here! It's really Xiao Jingming, I need to post on Weibo. Xiao Jingming, star of the New Year Gala is in the hospital with his celebrity wife Li Nana about to go into labor Rumor has it that the delivery is early by at least a month. ....one month earlier than the expected due date and giving birth on New Year's Eve Could this be PR for his new film? Or Perhaps another tactless publicity stunt? Hey, girl! Alright lets.... Were you once a comedian? We are reporting entertainment, not in a yelling competition, okay? Come on, you're only 2 months my senior in this business And you think that makes you an expert? Besides, what's wrong with my yelling? Did I use your microphone? Alright, whatever you say, I'm out of here. Lady you won! Fighting! Fighting! Come on, let's do it again. Xiao Jingming has been involved in a number of romantic scandals. Not long ago, his involvement with Fan Xiaobing was all over. Which almost led to a divorce with Li Nana However, during Li Nana's pregnancy Xiao Jingming has been extremely caring and considerate. He told reporters, that he would stay by his wife's side until the baby was born. Li Nana chose today, New Year's Eve, to go the hospital. Will the baby be a New Year's Eve Newborn? Everyone is waiting with great anticipation. Reported by Eyewitness Entertainment News. Hello, Wong. I've been waiting for you Can you come over now? Wong? Did you break up with Willie? When did you start seeing this Wong? Mom, Wong is my apartment's property manager. My lock has been broken for a week. I have been waiting for him all morning. My God, your door has been broken for a week now? Your property manager is horrible. It's New Year's Eve, I guess everyone is busy. No one is busier than me Li Nana is having her baby today I'm at the TV station waiting for Director Li. I really don't know how to tell him. Of all the days, why do they have to choose New Year's Eve? Shit Hey, don't use that language with me. I wasnt't talking to you, I spilt my milk By the way, that thing I asked you to do.. how is it coming along? I couldn't say it. That's strange, you've come up with many ideas for other couples weddings But you couldn't come up with anything for yourself? Willie's situation is different, you know his parents remarried twice He's traumatized Besides, he thinks marriage is just a piece of paper He said he would love me forever. forever! Your dad used the same line on me Love forever, whatever that is. Then I had you, and he disappeared. Do you really want to follow in my footsteps? You've been with Willie for 7 years, ever heard of "the seven-year-itch"? Especially for someone like Willie who works in international trade, and is always abroad. If marriage is just a piece of paper to him, why is it so difficult for him to give you that paper if he really loves you? Ms Yue! Director Li is already washing his hands. Listen to me, you definitely have to push hard if you want to get married. At least you'll force an answer out of him. Do you understand? I know you can do it. I'm waiting for your good news. Bye for now. Annoying Director Li, I was trying to tell to you about Jingming... One second Where is Zhang Daming? Didn't he say there were going to be a dozen people? Everyone else changed their minds Now it's just the four of us. Unbelievable I knew they had a shotgun marriage Xiangrong look! Oh my god, Li Nana is actually going to have a baby! Is it really that exciting? Well? You had so many opinions just now so tell us Didn't we agree on a plan? Exactly! Why don't you speak up? Brother, I was the only taking care of mom before she passed away, And I took care of Dad alone everytime he was sick. I have lived with Dad for almost 20 years now you want to take the apartment away. Where do you want me sleep? On the street? The apartment is downtown, we are surely to be relocated next year. And get atleast a 3-bedroom apartment! Exactly Sister, you have been living with Dad since your divorce Dad never asked you for rent, and are all fine with that But the problem is, if Dad is.....gone don't you think that apartment is too big for you? So, the rest of us talked about it. No I mean.. You know what I mean. We've come up with a plan We'll sell that apartment. Then, we'll buy you a 1-bedroom apartment out of the city for you to settle in. The rest of the money, We split it! Hello passengers, I am your Chief Conductor Zhang Weiwei It's New Year's Eve, on behalf of all the crew members I wish you all a Happy New Year This train is from Xi'an to Beijing Is this water or snot? What's wrong with you? So gross.....disgusting Sorry You're from Sichuan too? Which part of Sichuan are you from? Like hell I am! I am a Beijinger. Wow, she calls herself a Bejinger then I'm a Bejinger as well. What did I tell you? Trains are not for people like us. Look at all this, all germs and viruses All these people, dirt poor, Brother?

Is the baby here yet? It's not that fast, we just got to the hospital! When you told him I couldnt make it, what did Director Li say? Who do you think you are? He's fine. He said you don't have to be here for the rehearsal. But they can't move your slot in the show. If you don't make it, you would make his life very hard. He said your song is at 11:00pm, you can arrive 10:30pm That's still a couple of hours away, maybe Nana would have had the baby by then. Have you forgotten what labor is like? It might take hours alright? I promised Nana, that I'd be here for her. But the news has been all over for the past few months. I know that If you don't show up, it's going to affect you and Nana's reputation! A lot of people would be dissapointed. What's wrong? It hurts! Nana, we need to talk I...

Women are trouble, arent they? But they are actually easy to deal with. Spend time with them, buy them jewelry, and compliment them. The most important thing is to listen to their nagging and complaining. That's it! Easy for you to say. How much time have you spent with your girlfriend, since you became an officer? My girlfriend is different, she is very considerate. She prepares delicious food, makes milk tea, and waits for me I trained her well. Pretty awesome right? I should train you. Hello?

Coconut, iced coconut Come on! Wow, what a beautiful sand sculpture! You're quite talented! Thank you. Say something....what do you think? You're such a bastard! You want me to have a C-section! I just thought it might be the best choice. I could perform well, knowing that you and the baby are safe. If you have the baby after I leave...., I would regret it for the rest of my life. and you would also use it against me for the rest of my life. I know it's unfair Enough! Who am I? I am the gymnastics champion Li Nana. I would hate to tell people that I did not deliver this baby on my own! I want to do it myself. How about an injection to speed things up, doctor? We usually do not recomment that, especially for premature birth. The newborn may suffer from lung disorder, which may lead to respiratory problems. It's hard to predict the final effect on the baby Xiao Jingming! Get out! I don't want to listen to you! Get out! I don't want my son to know that his Dad is so cold-hearted. Get out of here! Alright alright, actually there are some other ways that can help to speed up the process. You want to give it a try? Inhale!... Push! Push! Push! We have been waiting at this hospital for four hours, So far, we still havent heard anything yet. We are not sure if she is on labor or still waiting.

I knew you were from Sichuan So what? Hormone Disorder. Who are you refering to, Boss? I bet she's not getting enough! All these successful women have hormone disorder, They do everything like men When you dont have a man for long period of time, you hormones get out of balance. But I think she looks fine.

All the money in our family was squandered by third brother, Don't you know that? What the hell are you talking about? Am I wrong? You've always been the trouble of our family getting into all kinds of fights, and we had to cover the medical bills. That's why we sold half of the house! If I wasn't helping you with your fights, would I have ended up in prison? Enough Second brother, it's been ages! why can't you let it go? It wasn't my fault that your wife runaway with someone else. Something was going on between you two, you bought her so much expensive stuff! I bought them in your name for God's sake! I wanted nothing from her! You think I'd be interested in your leftovers? Cut the crap! Come on keep going, why stop! Tell them how awesome you are! Tell them how awesome you are! So great, you even got syphilis. And I was responsble for taking you to the hospital. What are you saying? When was this, Third brother? That is crap, it was herpes or shingles! Shingles my ass! Then why didn't you go to a real hospital? You begged me to go with you in the middle of the night, and we went looking for ad's posted on telephone poles! Shameless! Third Brother, so are you okay now? Is it contagious? My husband just shook hands with you . Will you just shut up? Do not meddle in family business. The uneducated are truly frightening. Shut up, Sixth sister! What is so grand about Heilongjiang University? Sure I am uneducated, but there're many Peking University graduates working in my factory that call me "sir". Third Brother, social status isn't determined by money. Sure, I am uneducated. Fine, I don't need to stay here and annoy everyone. I'm leaving, and I wont cover half of the medical bill.

You're sure you don't want to take a look? It's fine, go on. This is the first time I've done something like this. And I believe, there won't be a second time in my life. I quit my job! I was afraid you might have this reaction. You know I never really enjoyed my job. My dream is to have an art gallery I know it would be hard to start a business now but..... I support whatever decision you make. Hardwork doesn't bother me. I love you. Thank you. I've got something you've always wanted Do you like them? Do you remember... Last time when we were in New York, you couldn't take your eyes of them. I know you didn't want to spend so much money. So this time, I went back there and I bought them for you. Try them on. Beautiful! Let me look at it in the mirror Sorry I'll clean it up! I'll do it, stay here. The New Year, is a time for reunions. Only a few days each year, today is New Year's Eve, What kind of work is this urgent... that it can't wait till tomorrow morning. Talk to your Boss. Granny, we really can't wait till tomorrow. The thing is,our VP Mr. Hou is so outstanding that our Boss really relies on him at work. And the Boss needs him today, if he doesn't go it wouldn't be right. Don't you think so? I understand Hou's parents died when he was very young. I raised him. He has always been a sweet child and so good to me. Now that he's doing well in Hong Kong, I'm so happy for him. But the more successful he is, the less I see him. But works comes first, go. I won't hold you back. Just remember to give me a call when you can, so I don't worry about you. Have you got a cold? I'm allergic to cats. What? Our cat has taken a liking to you. It's okay, just a little itching that's all. Meow Get down here, you! Are you out of your mind? I wish he could understand what you were saying. Come down please. Big Brother, please give the purse bact to me. You can't stay there forever! Come on, Angel. If we keep waiting, we can't get out of here! It's just a purse! Is it really that necessary? It is! Do you know what "limited edition" means? No! You expect me to give up something worth half a million? I'm not going anywhere without the purse! The purse is my life! Let me give it a try. Turn the flashlights at Angel. Sing and dance Attract the monkeys attention. I don't know how....... Xiao'ou, what are you doing? What an unforgettable night, Louder What the hell is she singing about? Xiao'ou Xiao'ou That will definitely leave a scar. So what? My mom said that scars represent bravery. The brave ones are the most admirable and the most worthy to be friends with. I'll carry you. Get on my back Let's go Fu! Are you okay? Piece of crap! Use mine, here. Now it seems I'll have to invite you,to my next vacation as well. Thank you. Are you guys alright? We're fine. We need to find a way out of here. Still short by half a meter. Okay. Mom won't work on New Year's Eve next year, alright? I promise Mom it's okay. As long as you and Dad stay together, I'll be fine. No more fights, we can't enjoy the New Year's like this. I know, I'm so sorry. Dad is a good man. But these are adult matters, you won't understand. Where is my wallet? Is it not here? Did that guy steal it? Did he? Where is my wallet? What wallet? Where did you go? I went to the bathroom, but there was a line. So, I'll try to go later. Enough with the tricks. Come on, give me the wallet. What are you doing, sir? What do you think I'm doing? Where's the wallet, his wallet? I didn't take your wallet. You were witting right next to me. When I took it out, you were staring at it like crazy. Sir, I swear I didn't take it! If you didn't take it, then let's have a quick search. Go ahead, search all you want. Wait and see. If I find it, I'll teach you a lesson. Do it! What is all this? My clothes Screw your clothes! This one, check it! Sir, you can't touch this one! I'm serious! Then it's suspicious. What are you waiting for? Liang do it! Don't mover around, fight in a civilized manner! Do not touch the innocent! Give it to me! You bastard! If this is the last fight I'll see this year, then what should I do? Should I get involved? I'm asking all my followers, I'm currently on a train heading to Beijing on New Year's Eve, Around me are passengers A, B, C and D. They couldn't control themselves and started fighting. Stop! He stole my wallet! I didn't! He might have, But you don't have any evidence. Evidence? You want evidence? Here! It's in this bag, open it and you all will see! Mom, they've wronged me! We are going to die here.... You need to lose some weight. I didn't think that this is how we'll spend New Year's Eve. If I knew Iwas going to be like this, I would be eating dumplings and watching the New Year's Gala with my parents at home! We were suppose to have a good time on New Year's Eve. I didnt expect this. Sorry Were you mimicking the male monkeys when we were trying to distract them? Yeah, I guess so. You did a great job. Actually when I was younger, I dreamed of becoming an explorer. When I finished high school, my uncle was filming a documentary about golden monkeys at Baima Snow Mountain. I was excited when he let me tag along. That was when I learned a bit about monkey behaviour. Who would have thought it would be useful today? I think you're pretty cool. Angel! Are you trying to kill us? Sorry! I meant for you to stand on it! We are half a meter short right? Come on! Now you can see the real value of my suitcase. This is to make up for all the trouble I've caused. To tell you the truth, my purse was fake. You don't have to say that, it's not important. Found them, they're all here! Fu! Xiangrong! Mom! Mom? Fu! I'm taking off. I'm exhausted, I'm leaving too. It was born?! Not yet. I had a dream about her delivering the baby. Sorry sis, I've got to go. My old man will whack me with his rolling pin if I don't get home soon. Don't worry, go home. I will send you some photos once I have them. How come you're so sweet! Let me buy you dinner some time. Sure. It's a date then. Alright. Beautiful, I have to go. Bye Bye Why is my sister not here yet? Nana, dorry I'm late. Mangmang Are you okay? Is everything okay? Are you okay? You came. I still can't deliver the baby. Don't worry, I'm here for you. Ms. Yue is on the phone asking if you're on your way? Do you want to answer it? Okay, I know! Honey, don't wait for me. He's definitely not coming out now. You don't know that, you're almost fully dilated. Honey, I know that for you perfoming on stage is like going into battle. I'd be so selfish, If I didn't let you go. Don't worry about me, our son and I will wait for you to return. I swear, I'll come back as soon as I can. Go! Don't worry, I'll stay with her. Thank you, Mangmang Thank you, Dr. Luo. Honey, thank you. I will be back soon. Take care of her for me. Ofcourse don't worry, I'll be here. Thank you, honey. Don't worry. Don't worry I'm so scared Don't be scared. It seems Xiao Jingming once again has chosen career over family. It's not easy to be a celebrity. Where are you going? Wait! Did I say something wrong? Why do you have to take a walk everytime you get upset? It's New Year's Eve, don't be like this. Baby, let's go inside and talk. Okay? Hey you're freaking me out with your silent treatment. Willie, Tell me have you ever thought about marrying me? So that's what this is all about? Havent we talked about it already? We don't care about formalities. I promised to be with you my whole life, isn't that enough? Why do you have to have that piece of paper? If you really love me that much, why wouldn't you give me that piece of paper? My parents already have 2 of those. 4 if you count the divorces. Do you think they're happier than us? My Dad used the same line on my Mom. Look, I've already planned weddings for a 100 couples Am I to be denied the chance to do one for myself? Chen Jiayi of 703? You've got a package. I'll take it Here you go. Wow, JD delivers even on New Year's Eve. All order placed before 11:00am can be delieverd on the same day. Hapy New Year, bye Jiayi, what's that sound? The oven is on fire! Open the door! I can't open the door! Open the door! The handle is broken. Call the fire department, hurry! What's happening? Talk to me! Answer me! Go upstairs! I can't get upstairs. Go to the bathroom, Get yourself wet and cover yourself with a wet blanket. Hurry up! Do you hear me? Jiayi, I love you. I love you too. Stay calm, I'll figure smething out. Everything will be fine. Open the door! Open the door! Cuihua, Cuihua, mommy found you! Come over here, don't be afraid. Come. My least favorite holiday is New Year's Day. Every New Year's Eve, I watch the Spring Festival Gala all alone. Why I'm I single? What did I do wrong? It's unfair, why can't I find a boyfriend? Why can't I find a girlfriend? Xiaoming, my New Year's wish is to get married. With someone as handsome as the guy next door. What do you think? Open the door! Open the door! I know you're there! Open the door! Mommy has a lot of tasty food for you. Come on, come on. Open the door! Quick call 911, It's not safe here go downstairs! Jiayi am on the balcony, Come out! Jiayi... Willie! Take it easy.

Almost there.. What happened? Just leave us! Jiayi, wait for me. Watch out! Willie, you're so stupid. This is suicidal! Do you think I can continue to live, after I watch you and Cuihua burn to death? I love you, it's all my fault. Sorry, I wont force you to marry me anymore. You love me more than your own life, but I keep pushing you! I swear, if we get out of this alive, I'll stay with you forever and be a good girl, Nothing else matters. Nothing matters if I lose you. I'm sorry I was selfish. When I felt like I would lose you, I realized.... If a piece of paper can bring you happiness, then why not just give it you? Jiayi, I love you. I am willing to give you everything you want. If we make it out alive, do you still want to marry me? Yes I do! Yes I do! Is this your coat? Yes, it's my fur coat. Mr. Officer this is mine. I searched it but found nothing. What's in here? Is this your wallet? Yes it is. How did it get in there? How come the fur coat has pockets. Brother, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to. I never meant to disturb you mother. Everyone, please go back to your own seats! Please go back to your seats. Everything is okay now. Everything is fine now. Today is New Year's Eve, the most special day of the entire year. We are all on this train, racing home. It's not easy for any of us. All of us are together on this train with the same goal, getting home for the New Year. You were all lucky enough to have managed to get tickets. In a way you can say fate brought us together, didn't it? As your conductor, I ask you all.... to take care of yourselves, and those around you. Have a happy New Year's Eve. Brother.. Everything is fine now. I'm so sorry, I deeply apologize. What I did was so rude You can hit me if that would make you feel better. Just hit me, will you? Hit me. I used to be like you, doing manual labor far from home. It was a difficult time. I lived a basement, and sometimes at a train station. I couldn't even afford instant noodles. Then I started working very hard to make money When my parents passed, I couldn't even be by their side. Now, I'm rich, but I don't have a family anymore I don't even know where to spend my New Year holiday I'm so sorry Madam, you have a great son, be rest assured Please don't haunt us. Brother, can you just give me a chance to make it up to you? Come and work for me I promise to take you out of poverty and make you wealthy What do you say? Boss you said the word.. I said.... "poverty" "poverty" Boss your condition is gone! "poverty" We're not afraid of "poverty" anymore! No more fear for "poverty" No more! We might have been poor, but that doesnt last forever! As long as you work hard, things will get better! My apologies to everyone, I have made such a mess. It is a holiday afterall, let me buy everyone something to drink Great! Grandma.. I.... I will definitely be here with you next New Year's Eve I don't think so. The earliest will probably be in 2 years. Okay, I know. I told you we will be done soon! You're still at work? Are you going to pick up mom or not? She's really going to be upset this time Dad, I don't want you two to get a divorce. I want to stay with you both. All right, I got it You haven't figured it out yet. When I was young I was just like you, working so hard to make money. Now I look back at the things I can remember, and they have nothing to do with work. Grandma, we have to leave now Have some more soup Grandma let me. Let me do it... No matter howbusy you are, always remember to call me when you can. Okay Call me, let me hear your voice, okay? That's all I can ask for. I will, when I get out..... When I come back, I will save enough money, for your eye surgery. No need, it will be very expensive. As long as you're happy, then I'm happy! Find a good girl and have a baby, so I can be a great grandmother. You two as well. Nothing is more inportant, than spending more time with your family. Hou, listen.. The time is 10:17pm It's telling me the time. Give me a hug Grandma, wait a second Grandma, Mr. Hou forgot something... He asked me to give you this money Please take it. Thank you. Happy New Year. You too. I now understand why you didn't want to arrest him at home. Treat your wife better. When is your flight? I'm late! I'm not going to make it! Let me give you a ride! I didn't know you were this nice! I don't want you to get butchered by your girlfriend for being late! I'm more concerned for you! I already transferred the deed of the house to your eldest sister. It's all up to her from now on! She can give it to anyone or sell it as she wishes! Because I know, she will treat each one of your fairly. My two youngest children, remember that your elder sister quit school, before graduating from Junior High School. And sold sweet potatoes on the streets to get you through school. All the money she made was spent on you two, just so we can have two intellectuals in our family. Don't think that because you are the most educated, that you know everything. College graduates do ignorant things too. A small fight ended with a divorce, Sister and our Niannian suffered so much due to that. A boy without his father's love, could be bullied, are you aware of that? Dad, I understand. Now my fourth son, since you got laid off you started your own business. Every penny you earned came the hard way. But you should never put money above... the bonds between siblings. My Second son, stop complaining about the trouble your younger brother dragged you into. It's been 20 years. Leave the history behind and move on! Set a good example for your son. That's what father's do! My youngest son, we're all proud to have a government official.. in our family. But, when you are with family... stop being so pretentious. Nobody cares about that! And my third son, I know you must have gone through a lot these years Now that you're doing so well, I am very.... proud of you. You are the most successful one in our family. When I'm gone, you have to share the responsibilities with your elder sister to hold the family together. I haven't been much of a loving father. Unlike your mother, who was always gentle and reasonable. In the future, as long as you come visit my grave, and tell your children about me, I'll be content. Dad, actually my factory isn't doing so well. I'm so worried. My factory is closing down. Third brother, you wouldn't ask as to sell the house to pay your debt again right? Shut you mouth, you ignorant woman! Stop meddling in our family business! Third brother, do not be upset! If business is not going so well, you can always come home. With all of us, we can get through anything together1 Yes Third brother, let us know if you need any help. Third brother, just let us know. Sorry for being rude to you, Third brother. Right! With a happy home, all will be well! Once our family is in harmony, everything else will prosper! I'm staying here, you guys can go home. No, you have to take care of your wife. Her leg is still healing It's fine, we will be okay. Stop arguing, big sister and I will stay. Yes, we are used to it anyways. Listen to me, no one needs to stay here! I wan to spend New Year's Eve at home. If it's the last New Year's for me, I want to go back to our small house for New Year's Eve. After that, I can go without regrets. I have no regrets. Dad! Hurry up, Second Brother. Dad, sit tight and watch my drifting skill!! Fourth brother, Take this Hurry! Come back! Wait! Stop! Dad, are you okay?

We are about to welcome our new family member. Stop being so immature, okay? I have no idea why I brought this up. Don't blame me. I won't. I've been used to it after 9 months like this.

My mom and aunts and uncles and everyone Are all at home waiting to see me on TV. But what should I do now? Don't worry. Stand up! Stop crying. It's okay. We can go to find your teacher. My teachers and classmates are not outside now! They dumped me! Alright, wait a second. Wait for me. One second. One second. Smell good, right? Two males and two females. I hunted them on my own. -Thank you, Mr. Wang. -Don't call me Mr. Wang, call me Wild Game Wang! If I didn't notice that man who is barbequing the rabbits went to the reception with your luggage, you kids would have been in big trouble tonight, right? How did you know where do we stay? His credit card is on my account. I paid the deposit two weeks ago. I know it of course. We don't want to bother you. But we just want to make sure you are safe. Cheers, everyone! Yes, come on! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Teacher! Niannian! Where have you been? We were looking for you! This is Beijing, not Harbin. You are not allowed to run around, okay? Just stay here. Niannian, Niannian! Come here! Niannian, don't cry! Let me tell you a secret. Do you know that I was often bullied by others when I was young? You also don't have dad, do you? No. I found out gradually after I grow up that sometimes bad things can turn to good things. People most have dreams. Never give up until the last minute. Trust me. Okay? Stop crying.
