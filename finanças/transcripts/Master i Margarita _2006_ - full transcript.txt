Dedicated to the talent and craftsmanship of the great actors in this film. TAMP Film Company and Master Distribution present A Vladimir Skoriy film Based on a novel by Mikhail Afanasievich Bulgakov Master and Margarita Moscow, 1930s Satan (Woland) unexpectedly arrives in the city to tell people about the life and teachings of Christ (Yeshua) and remind them of Judgement Day... A film by Yuri Kara featuring Anastasiya Vertinskaya Viktor Rakov Mikhail Ulyanov Nikolai Burlyayev Valentin Gaft Aleksandr Filippenko produced by Alexandr Mishin Executive producers Irina Mineyeva and Alexandr Daskevich Director of photography Yevgeniy Grebnev Ivan! Unfortunately, your poem won't do for us at all. We asked for an anti-religious propaganda piece. Narzan mineral water. - No Narzan. - Any beer? Beer will be delivered towards the evening. What do you have, then? Apricot water only, but it's warm. All right.... All right, all right, all right! So? It's not a matter of what kind of person Jesus was, good or bad. In your poem, all you need to do is to show that he never even existed at all! What? You know... Oh, damnation! I almost had a stroke because of this heat. I had a... hallucination or something. - Just now? - Yeah. There's not a single Eastern religion in which an immaculate virgin didn't give birth to a god. So, the Christians didn't invent anything new by creating Jesus, who, as we know, did not exist. All you needed to do was - ... just when we're talking about Jesus and that stuff! Excuse me, please, that, not being your acquaintance, I take the liberty... but the subject of your conversation is so interesting... that I... May I sit? Unless I heard wrongly, you were just saying... that Jesus... never existed? You did not hear wrongly. That's exactly what I said. Oh, how interesting! And you were agreeing with him? A hundred percent! Forgive my importunity, but, as I understand, along with everything else, you also do not believe in God? I swear, I won't tell anyone! Yes, we don't believe in God. But you can talk about it freely. Well, this is the question that troubles me. If there is no God, then who, one may ask, governs human life, and keeps the world in order? Man himself controls his destiny. Excuse me, but in order to govern one must, after all, have a certain plan, for at least some ridiculously short period, well, let's say... a thousand years. But a man cannot even vouch for his own tomorrow! What if he, say, slips and falls under a tram-car! Yes, man is mortal. Even worse, his mortality is unpredictable! He can't even know what'll happen to him the same evening! Well, I know what'll happen to me this evening. It goes without saying, if a brick should fall on my head on Bronnaya, and - No brick will ever fall on anyone's head out of the blue. In your case, I assure you, you are in no danger of that at all. You will die a different death. I suppose you know what kind precisely... and will tell me? Willingly. Your head will be cut off. I wonder who is going to do it? Enemies? Interventionists? No, a Russian woman. A Communist Youth girl. A Communist Youth girl. But why? I'm having a meeting at Massolit this evening. Why? Because Annushka has already bought the sunflower oil, and, moreover, has not only bought it, but already spilled it too. So the meeting will not take place. Forgive me, but what has sunflower oil got to do with it... and... who is Annushka? I'll tell you what sunflower oil has to do with it! Have you ever, citizen, happened to be in a hospital for the mentally ill? Ivan, Ivan! I have, I have. And more than once! Where haven't I been?! Only it's too bad I didn't get around to asking the professor what schizophrenia is. So you will have to find that out from him yourself, Ivan Nikolayich! How do you know my name? For pity's sake! Who doesn't know you! Ivan Nikolayich, poet... and highly productive strike worker... I am sorry! Can you give me a minute? I want a quick word with my friend. With pleasure! It's so nice here under the linden trees. And I'm in no particular hurry. Listen here, Misha! He's no foreign tourist. He's a spy! A Russian emigr√© who has returned. Ask for his ID before he gets away! Excuse me for having forgotten, in the heat of our dispute, to introduce myself. Here is my card... my passport, and an invitation to Moscow for consultations. You've been invited here as a consultant, Professor? Yes, as a consultant. Are you German? I? I suppose you could say that! And what is your field? I am a specialist in black magic. By the way, Jesus did exist. But we still need proof. There's no need for proof. It's all simple. In a white cloak, with blood-red lining... So it was you who wanted to reign in Jerusalem? Good man! Believe me ... Is it me whom you are calling a good man? You are mistaken. It is rumoured about me in Jerusalem that I am a fierce monster. Teach him. The Roman Procurator is addressed as 'Hegemon'. No other name. Stand to attention. Do you understand me? Or do I hit you again? I understand you. Don't hit me. Name? Yeshua. Any other name? Ha-Notsri. So why did you want to destroy the temple and incite the people to do it? I, goo- I, Hegemon, have never intended to destroy the temple. And I never incited anyone to conduct such a meaningless act. Then, what did you say about the temple to the crowd in the bazaar? I said... that the Temple of the old faith is going to fall. And the new Temple will be created, the temple of Truth. And why did you stir up the people in the bazaar, talking about the Truth, of which you have no notion? What is the Truth? The Truth... the truth for you is, first of all, that your head aches, and aches so badly that you're starting to have thoughts of death. This is a truth that I too could reveal. But your sufferings will be over now, and the headache will go away. Well, that's it. And I am happy for it, sincerely. I would advise you, Hegemon, to leave the palace for a while, and take a walk in the vicinity. And I would be glad to accompany you, and willingly share my thoughts with you. Unbind his hands. So you maintain that you did not incite anyone to destroy, set fire to, or in any other way demolish, the temple? I did not incite anyone to such acts. Do I look like a halfwit? Oh, no, you don't look like a halfwit. Swear, then, that you didn't do it. By what do you want me to swear? Well, let's say, by your life. It's high time you swore by it, since it's hanging by a thread. You think it was you who hung it, Hegemon? I can cut that thread. You will surely agree that the thread can only be cut... by the one who hung it. And now, tell me, do you call everyone "good people". Yes. There are no evil people in the world. That's the first I've heard of it! But take, for instance, the centurion Mark, known as Rat Slayer. Is he good? Oh, yes. But he's very unhappy. Since a German disfigured him in the Battle of Idistaviso he has become cruel, and hard. Have you ever met Mark before? No, I have not. I do not confirm the death sentence on Yeshua Ha-Notsri passed by the Lesser Sanhedrin. Is that all about him? Unfortunately, not. An outrage against His Majesty Caesar! Who's the informer? The best among Caiaphas's men in Jerusalem, Judas from Karioth! Do you know a certain Judas from Karioth? And what did you say to him? Did you say anything about Caesar? It was like this. The evening before last, near the temple's gate I made the acquaintance of a young man. He invited me to his home. A good man? Yes, a very good man and an inquisitive one. He asked me to give my view of state authority. So, what did you say? Among other things, I said that all authority is violence over people, and that a time will come when there will be no rule by Caesar, or any other authority. Man will pass into the kingdom of truth... and justice. There never has been, is not now, and never will be, any authority in this world greater or better for people than the authority of the emperor Tiberius! And it is not for you, insane criminal, to reason about it! Rat Slayer, take the convoy off the balcony! Leave me alone! This is a state matter! I have a foreboding, Hegemon, that Judas will come to grief. I am very sorry for him. You'd better be concerned for yourself, not for Judas. He's a good man? Yes. And the Kingdom of truth is coming? It is, Hegemon. It will never come! Never! You, loathsome Jerusalem! Yeshua Ha-Notsri, do you believe in any gods? God is one. I believe in Him. Then pray to him. Pray hard. However it will not help you now. Do you have a wife? No. I'm alone. Oh, loathsome city! If they'd murdered you before your meeting with Judas, it would have been better. You should let me go, Hegemon. I see that they want to kill me. Do you suppose, wretch, that the Roman Procurator will free a man who has said what you have said? Or you think that I am ready to take your place? Hegemon. Silence. Silence. Come over here! In the name of the Great Emperor, I confirm the death sentence on the criminal Yeshua Ha-Notsri. Take him away. The first two criminals, Dismas and Hestas, who ventured to incite the people to rebel against Caesar, were taken in armed struggle by the Roman authorities. But Bar-Abba and Ha-Notsri, were seized by the local authorities and condemned by the Sanhedrin, so according to the Law and the tradition, one of the last two must be set free, in honour of the great feast of Passover. The Sanhedrin asks that we release Bar-Abba. Bar-Abba? The case against him is much stronger. The Sanhedrin has thoroughly familiarised itself with the case. And for a second time informs you that it intends to free Bar-Abba. How? Even after my intercession? The intercession of the one through whom Roman authority speaks? It is not peace, no, it is not peace... that this seducer of the people of Jerusalem has come to bring. And you, Roman, understand that perfectly well. Oh, by the way, Caiaphas, I've heard you have some very good people beside you. Especially... the young man called Judas from Karioth. Take care of him. He's useful. We'll find a new one. In the name of Caesar, the Emperor! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Four criminals, arrested in Jerusalem for murder incitement to rebellion, and outrages against the laws and the faith, have been sentenced to the most shameful execution by crucifixion! The names of the criminals are Dismas, Hestas, Bar-Abba and Ha-Notsri. But to one of the condemned, in honour of the feast of Passover, the magnanimous Caesar, the Emperor, will return his contemptible life. The name of the one who will now be set free before you is... Bar-Abba. Hooray! Well, nobody can confirm what you've just said. Oh, there is one who can confirm it. You see, I was personally present at it all. But secretly. Incognito, as they say. How long have you been in Moscow? Just now, this very minute I have come to Moscow. Did you come alone or with your wife? Alone, alone. I'm always alone. And... where are your things? Where are you staying? Nowhere. But where are you going to stay? In your apartment! Huh, I'm very glad. But I'm afraid you'll not be comfortable there. They have wonderful rooms at the Metropol. And there's no Devil either? No Devil! Ivan, shut up! There isn't any Devil! How frustrating this is! Stop playing the psychologist! Well, now that is really interesting! What is it with you? Whatever I ask you about, it doesn't exist! No! You, Ivan Nikolayich, do believe in Christ, in a big way. Oh! The black magic is coming! You have to be consistent. Please, I invite you to... trample upon this portrait. But... it looks strange. I don't want to. Are you afraid? Certainly not! You are afraid. Have mercy, Professor! He doesn't believe in any Christ! But... it's ridiculous! It's childishly ridiculous to confirm your disbelief like this! You shouldn't have been spouting such rubbish then! You're an atheist! A theomachist! (a God-resister) How are you going to preach it to peasants? What kind of propagandist are you? Miserable intellectual! That's who you are! Who? I am an intellectual? I am an intellectual? Just watch this! Stop! Stop it. Even after my Gospel? After all I've told you about Yeshua? Mikhail Alexandrovich, aren't you going to stop this young madman? And you? You've heard it? I've told everything. Right? Stop him, stop him. You're older. This is so stupid, stupid! I will neither encourage nor stop him. So, take this! Take that! So, everything is in order. And Moira, the Daughter of the Night has finished spinning her thread. Calm down, calm down. Calm down, professor! You sit here for a while with comrade Bezdomny. I'll just run to the corner to make a phone call. - To make a call? - Yes! But I implore you, before you go, at least believe that the Devil exists! There exists a seventh proof of it, the surest of all! Very good, very good! Mikhail Alexandrovich! Would you like me to have a telegram sent to your uncle in Kiev? Looking for the turnstile, citizen? This way, please! Straight on and you'll get where you're going. How about a little vodka for my help? Be kind to an old fellow! CAUTION! TRAM-CAR! Oh, my God! What happened? Call an ambulance! Ambulance! Yes, ambulance! Annushka, Annushka! It's her fault! She bought sunflower oil, and broke the whole litre-bottle on the turnstile! And he slipped on it! Annushka, Annushka! Wait a minute, wait a minute... The meeting wouldn't take place because... Annushka had spilled the oil! And Berlioz's head would be cut off by a Communist Youth girl! Confess, who are you? I... no... understand Russian... no speak... You don't understand Russian? They don't understand! They don't! Stop pretending! You were speaking Russian perfectly fine just now! You're not a German, and not a Professor! You're a spy and a murderer! Your ID! Citizen! What are you doing, bothering a foreign tourist? For that you'll incur severe punishment! Citizen! Help me to detain the criminal! It's your duty! - A criminal? Where is he? - There! That one! There! If he's a criminal, the first thing to do is shout "Help!" Or else he'll get away. Come on, together now, one...! HELP! Oh, so you are... you are... - ...you are with him? - Me? - What? What, are you serious? - No! No! What are you doing? Get out of my way! - Get out of my way! - All right, all right! Wait! Getting under my feet on purpose, right? I, personally, will hand you over to the authorities, now! Oh, you, dandy! Stop! Damn! - I'll shoot you! - I won't let you! Where is he? Kiriushka! Stop this tomfoolery! Have you lost your mind? Fyodor Ivanych will be back any minute. Get out right now! Libertine! People! The Evil One is in the city! The consultant! The consultant! In the city! He's here! The Evil One is in the city! People! Citizen! You are under arrest! Hands up! Stop, scoundrel! Here... here... He's here! Here, in the Kremlin! - The Evil One has found his shelter! - Who's there? Where are you going? Let me go! Are you with him? Damn, I'm so hungry! By the way, it's eleven already, and Berlioz is still not here! Is this damn meeting ever going to happen at all? The fellow must've got stuck on the Klyazma. Excuse me! But the meeting was set for ten o'clock! It's nice now on the Klyazma. The nightingales are singing already, I guess. That's right! It's the third year I've paid to send my wife to that paradise for her goitre, but it doesn't make any difference. Some are lucky and some are not, colleague. We're all writers, but it's the Generals among us who got the dachas. Latunsky, for instance, That's not the point right now. The point is, it's half past twelve already. Hello, hello. Is that Perelygino? Berlioz's dacha? Ah, Lavrovich's? Is Berlioz there by any chance? No! He can't even give us a call! So, they're enjoying themselves at the dacha, and we're left here to die from hunger? That's it! I'm going to the restaurant! To dinner! Halle- halle- hallelujah! "Hallelujah" by Vincent Youmans I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Greetings, friends! No! He's not here! No big mystery, folks. He's just drunk. How could the authorities let him walk the streets like that? Twice they have wanted to detain me! But I hopped over the fence and, as you can see, cut my cheek! Brethren in literature! Listen to me, everyone! He... has appeared! Catch him immediately, otherwise he'll do untold harm! Who? Who's appeared? The Consultant! And this Consultant has just killed Misha Berlioz at the Patriarch's Ponds. And what is his name? If only I knew his name! I only remember the first letter! W... W... Wagner? Winter? Weiner? Wolf? Fool! What has Wolf got to do with it? Wolf could not do anything like that! Now look, everybody, call the authorities immediately! Let them send five motorcycles with machine-guns to catch the professor. And meanwhile I'll search Griboyedov's, I sense that he's here! Get out of my way, Aramean! Get off! He's somewhere around! Did you see he was in his underpants? But, Archibald Archibaldovich, how could I not let him in given that he's a member of Massolit? Comrade Bezdomny, calm down! We all understand that you're upset at the death of our beloved Misha Berlioz! You, don't you understand that the professor must be caught! Ivan Nikolayich! Cretin! Ivan Nikolayich, excuse me - No! Anyone else! But you, I will not excuse! We don't need a doorman like you here even if you worked for nothing! Go find yourself a job as a church verger. Get off, Arameans! My hand, my hand! To the psychiatric clinic. Blow your whistle! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! You lousy intellectuals! Do you know whose arms you are twisting? The arms of a Proletarian poet! Release me! Let me go! Bastards! Corrupt Arameans! Trotskyists! Bastards! Low-lifes! Here, doctor, is the renowned poet Ivan Bezdomny. You see... we're afraid it might be alcohol withdrawal. - Does he bite? - Not so far. Was he drinking hard? No. He drank, but not that much. Did he chase after cockroaches, rats, little devils, or slinking dogs? No, no, doctor. I was at his place yesterday, and I saw him this morning. He was perfectly well. And why is he in his underwear? Did you get him out of bed? No, doctor. He came to the restaurant that way. And why the scratches? Did he have a fight? No, he fell off the fence. And then in the restaurant he hit somebody, and then somebody else - Yes, yes, yes. Hello there. Greetings, saboteur! How old are you? You can all go to the devil! Why are you so angry? I didn't say anything bad to you. I'm twenty-three years old, and I'll file a complaint against you all. And particularly against you, louse! And what do you want to complain about, may I ask? About the fact that I, a healthy man, was seized and dragged by force to a madhouse! This isn't a madhouse. Bring him here. Take a seat. You are in a clinic, my good fellow, where no one will keep you if it's not necessary. Ha! Thank you, Lord! Finally! There is a normal man among the idiots! Tell me, please, why did you come to the restaurant wearing nothing but your underwear? I went for a swim in the Moscow River. Yeah? Someone took my clothes, and I had to come like this, because I was in hurry to get to the restaurant, to Griboyedov! That's the name of the restaurant. Why were you in a hurry? You had something important to do? I'm going after the Consultant. Do you know Berlioz? Yes, the composer. What composer?! Oh, sorry. Oh, yes. There is a composer. But the composer just has the same name as our Misha Berlioz. The chairman of Massolit, Berlioz, was run over by a tram-car tonight at the Patriarch's Ponds. Don't gossip about what you don't know! He got him under the tram-car on purpose. - Pushed him? - "Pushed him", my eye! His kind don't need to push! He knew beforehand that Berlioz would fall under the tram-car! And did anyone besides you see this consultant? That is the trouble. Just Berlioz and I. Did you take any measures to catch the murderer? I got a little candle from the kitchen. - This one? - Exactly this one. And why the icon? Ah, yes, the icon... It was the icon that frightened them most of all. To get things straight, the Consultant... let's speak directly, rubs elbows with the unclean powers! He won't be caught so easily! Rubs elbows! An absolute fact. Yes? In person... he spoke with Pontius Pilate. And there's no need to stare at me like that. I'm telling the truth! He saw everything... the balcony... the palm trees. In short, he was there with Pontius Pilate. I can... vouch for it. All right, all right, all right! Yes! So... I pinned the icon on my chest... and ran. Oh! It's two o'clock! And I'm wasting time with you! Excuse me, where's the telephone? Let him use the telephone. Police! Police! Comrade officer-on-duty give orders at once to send five motorcycles with machine-guns. To catch the foreign consultant! Come and pick me up. I'll go with you. It's the poet Bezdomny speaking from the madhouse. What's your address? Karl Marx Street, number 13. Hello. Hello, police! Hello! Outrageous! Goodbye. Let me pass. Let me pass, now! Where do you intend to go, in the dead of night, in your underwear? You're not well. Stay with us. Ah, so? Well, then... Farewell! So that's the sort of window you've got here! Bandits! Rascals! Rotten bastard! - Let me go! - Quickly, quickly! A bath, a private room, number 117, and a nurse to watch him. Doctor, tell me, please, is this very serious? Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes. But what is it? Locomotive and speech excitation, delirious illusions... Like this! A complex, complex case, it seems. Schizophrenia, I suppose. Well, and... alcoholism. Grunya, give me some aspirin! Misha! Misha! Berlioz! Are you home? Good morning, my dear Stepan Bogdanovich! What can I do for you? Eleven o'clock. Exactly an hour I've been waiting for you to wake up. You made an appointment for me to come here at ten. So here I am! Forgive me. Tell me your name, please? What? You don't even remember my name? Frankly speaking... yesterday I had a bit too much... Dear Stepan Bogdanovich! No aspirin can help you. Follow the wise old rule... the hair of the dog. The only thing that will make you feel better is two glasses of vodka... with spicy and hot appetisers. - And you? - With pleasure! So... Why don't you... have a bite of something? Thank you, but I never eat when drinking. I hope by now you've remembered my name? Nope! I get the feeling that you followed the vodka with port wine! Yeah. This simply shouldn't be done! Professor of black magic... Woland. I want to remind you that yesterday I arrived from abroad in Moscow, and signed a contract with you for seven performances at Variety. Here is the contract and the signatures, yours and Rimsky's. Your housekeeper, Grunya, opened the door for me. She said that your neighbour, Mikhail Berlioz, was not at home, and if I wanted to see you, I should go to your bedroom. But... when I saw your condition, naturally, I sent Grunya to the shops for vodka and hors d'oeuvres, and to the chemist's for ice. Allow me to reimburse you. What nonsense! Then, please excuse me for a minute. Grunya! Grunya! Grunya! Oh, my God! "Official Notice: Berlioz has been arrested." Hello, Rimsky? It's me, Likhodeev! I have this artiste Woland here! Ah... What? I'll be there soon. Grunya! What's this cat doing in here? Where did he come from? And there's somebody else! I see, you are surprised, my dear Stepan Bogdanovich? But, in fact, there is no cause for surprise. This is my entourage. And this entourage requires room. There's one too many of us in this apartment. And it seems to me that this one is... you. Theirself, theirself! Theirself has been up to some terribly boorish behaviour lately. Drinking, liaisons with women... Availing hisself of a government car! Generally, I don't understand how he got to be a director. He's as much a director as I'm a bishop. You don't look like a bishop, Azazello. That's what I mean. Allow me, Messire, to chuck him the hell out of Moscow? Shoo! I implore you, tell me... tell me what city is this? Oh, dear! The fellow is sozzled! I'm not drunk! I'm not well! Hello! Something's happened to me. I'm not well! Tell me what city is this? Where am I? What city? Yalta! Yalta? Ha! Nikanor Ivanovich! Who might you be, citizen? You... are you an official? Ah, Nikanor Ivanovich! What is... an official, or an unofficial person? It depends on your point of view! Today I'm an unofficial person, and then tomorrow... I'm an official! And it also happens the other way round. Today, an official person, but tomorrow, see, unofficial! Oh, it happens! It happens, Nikanor Ivanovich... oh, it does! Yes, but who are you? What's your name? My name... well, let's say... it's Koroviev. But wouldn't you like a little snack, Nikanor Ivanovich? No formalities, eh? But... excuse me, how can you... have snacks here? What are you doing here? You shouldn't be in... a dead man's apartment. Who are you? Me? What are you doing here? Me? I serve as interpreter for a foreign individual who has taken up residence in this apartment. What? A foreigner? A foreign artiste named Mr Woland has been kindly invited by the director of the Variety, Stepan Bogdanovich Likhodeev, to spend the time of his performances, a week or so, in his apartment, while Likhodeev himself took a trip to Yalta, about which he informed you yesterday evening in writing. He never wrote me anything. Just check. Check. How could I forget about it? All sorts of things happen. All sorts, my dear friend. Nikanor Ivanovich. I'm terribly absent-minded myself! Fatigue and high blood-pressure! Someday, over a glass, I'll tell you a few things from my life story. You could die laughing! And when is Likhodeev going to Yalta? He has already gone. Gone! He's already, you know, wheeling along, wheeling along! He's already devil knows where! I must... see the foreigner in person. Impossible, no way. Impossible. He's busy. Busy. Training the cat. The cat I can show you... if you like. No, I don't need the cat. Thank you, anyway. Nikanor Ivanovich, you see, Nikanor Ivanovich! Considering that Mr Woland has no desire whatsoever to live in a hotel, can the tenants' association, rent to him for just one week the apartment, the whole of the apartment, that is, including the deceased's rooms. The deceased, as you can see, doesn't ne- All foreigners must stay at the Metropol. He's capricious, I tell you, as the devil only knows! You know... he has no desire to... He doesn't like... hotels! I've had them up to here, these foreign tourists! They come, and either spy on you, like the lowest son of a bitch, or else torment you with their complaints. This isn't right... that isn't right! And for your association, Nikanor Ivanovich, it's a sheer gain and an obvious profit. The contract. This is for you. And this is for us. One! Two! Three! Count it! Cash loves to be counted! Your own eyes... won't lie. What about a pass? Don't mention it, Nikanor Ivanovich! How many tickets do you want? Twelve? Fifteen? Or just for you... and your wife. It isn't done... With us it's not done, but with foreigners it is. You'll offend the foreign tourist, Nikanor Ivanovich, and that's embarrassing. You've worked hard... It's strictly forbidden. But where are the witnesses, eh? Oh, come on! Hello! I consider it my duty to inform you that the chairman of our tenants' association at no. 502-bis on Sadovaya, Nikanor Ivanovich Bosoy, is speculating in foreign currency. At the present moment, in his apartment no. 35, in the ventilation of the lavatory, wrapped up in newspaper he has four hundred dollars. This is a tenant of the said house speaking, Timofei Kvastsov. I beg you to keep my name a secret. I fear the vengeance of the afore-mentioned chairman. There are thirty-two applications for the apartment of the deceased Berlioz. And if you knew what those bastards write! And that... Luska from room no. 13 has confessed to a secret pregnancy! What the hell! Can't a man eat in peace? Somebody's at the door again! Don't let anyone in! I'm not here! I'm not! If it's about the apartment... tell them to stop chasing. There'll be a meeting... next week. This way, this way. Where's the lavatory? Eh, what's the matter? There's no problem here. Do you have a search warrant? Sorry to ask... Where's the lavatory? Ah! Over here! Here. Here. Dollars in the ventilation. Your little stash? - No. - Oh, my God! - Enemies planted it! - That happens. Well, you're going to have to turn in the rest. I haven't got any! I swear to God, I never laid a finger on it! Here's the contract. That awful interpreter planted it. Koroviev... with his pince-nez... Brothers! There are unclean powers in our house. Catch them! Repent, Ivanych! Repent! You'll get off lighter. Ah, you, goddamned fool! Look! So many people want to see that Woland! Who? Varenukha? He's not here. No. Listen, Varenukha. Why don't you call Likhodeev again? I did call him. And sent Karpov to his place. There's no one in his apartment. What if he fell under a tram-car, just like Berlioz? That would be too much to hope. Yes, yes. Where is the Variety? Here. Why? - An urgent telegram for you. - All right. Sign here. "Today, half past eleven, "brown-haired man came to criminal investigation dept, night shirt, trousers, shoeless. Mentally ill." Ha! "Calls himself Likhodeev. "Director... Director Variety... "Go immediately to Yalta Investigation dept. "Where is Likhodeev?" Ha! Well, well, well! False Dmitry! Right! Telegraph? Take an urgent telegram. On Variety. Yalta, Criminal Investigation department. "Director Variety Likhodeev in Moscow." Of course! "Find director Rimsky". - Yes? - There is another one. "Beg believe thrown Yalta Woland hypnosis" "Wire criminal investigation. ConÔ¨Årm identity. Likhodeev". - Citizens! Sign here! - Oh, yes. Then you can stare at it as much as you want! - These are urgent! - Thank you! Fine, fine! How many kilometres to Yalta? To Yalta? Well, by train it is... 1500 kilometres. And by air... No, no! How could he have flown there? By fighter plane? Who'd let him into a fighter plane? He's shoeless, after all! Listen here, Ivan Savelyevich. Yes? Take the telegrams. Send them personally! Hello! Excuse me, excuse me. I'm the administrator of the Variety theatre. Calm down, calm down. Calm down! Asya! Save twenty seats, the best ones! In the stalls, yes. Ivan Savelyevich, telephone call for you. Yes! What? Telephone call! Telephone call? - Hello! - Varenukha... He's not here. Ivan Savelyevich, don't fool around, listen to me! What? All right, all right. What do you... Do not take those telegrams anywhere or show them to anyone. What? Who am I talking to? - Do you understand Russian? - Don't take the telegrams anywhere. Is that you, Ivan Savelyevich? Yes, it's me. It's me. What have you got in the briefcase, parasite? Telegrams! Weren't you warned not to take them anywhere? Weren't you? I'm asking, weren't you warned? Yes, I was. And you still took them? Let me give you... a kiss. It's a very significant incident, indeed. A magazine editor got run over! And the magazine may have to shut down because of it. I should have questioned the man who personally knew Pontius Pilate. May I sit? How did you get in here? Aren't... the balcony grilles locked? Yes, the grilles are locked. But Praskovya Fyodorovna, our nurse, is nice but, alas, quite absent-minded. A month ago I stole a bunch of keys from her, so gained the opportunity... If you have... the keys, then you can escape. Or is it too high here? I cannot escape from here, not because it's high, but because I have nowhere to escape to. So... here we are. Here we are. You're not violent, I hope? Because, you know, I cannot stand noise, turmoil, force... Yesterday in a restaurant I punched someone in the face. Your reason? No reason, I confess. Outrageous. Your line of work? A poet. Ah, just my luck! And what's your name? Bezdomny. Ah, yes. What are you trying to say? You dislike my poetry? I dislike it intensely. And what have you read? I've never read any of your poetry! Then how can you say you dislike it? Why not? I've read plenty of other poetry. Unless, by some... miracle... All right... I'll take your word for it. Is your poetry good? You tell me yourself. It's terrible! Don't write anymore. I promise. And I swear! So, how did you wind up here? On account of Pontius Pilate. What?! A staggering coincidence! I beg you, tell me. And now, citizens... there is about to come before you... the famous foreign artist Messire Woland, with a seance of black magic. Let's bring on Mr Woland! Bring him on! Tell me, my gentle Fagott, the Moscow populace has changed signiÔ¨Åcantly, hasn't it? That it has, Messire. The city folk have changed greatly... externally, that is... as has the city itself, incidentally... not to mention their clothing. But also have appeared... those... hmm... automobiles, trams... Buses! The foreign artiste is expressing his admiration for Moscow and its technological development, as well as, of course, for the Muscovites! Have I expressed any admiration? By no means, Messire, did you ever express any admiration. Then why did the man say that? Quite simply... he lied! Well done, mister. You lied! But I'm interested in a more important question. How much have... the city folk changed... inwardly? Ah, that is the most important question, sir. That's enough talk from us, my dear Fagott. The audience is beginning to get bored. Show us some simple little thing to start with. You'll Ô¨Ånd that same deck, esteemed citizens, in the second row, on citizen Parchevsky. You may keep it as a souvenir! Not for nothing did you say at dinner yesterday that if it weren't for poker, your life in Moscow would be utterly unbearable. That's an old trick. That fellow is from the same company! You think so? In that case you're also with us, because the deck is in your pocket! Oh, my! These are ten-rouble bills! Play the same trick on me! But why just you? Everyone will warmly participate! Yes! Yes! Yes! All right! Look up! One, Two, Three! Ten-rouble bills! Let us ask Maestro Woland to expose this experiment for us. Presently, citizens, you will see these supposed banknotes disappear as suddenly as they appeared. This is a case of so-called lying. The notes, citizens, are genuine. This fellow, incidentally, annoys me. Keeps poking his nose where nobody's asked him. What're we going to do with him? Tear his head off! What? Tear his head off? Hmm, that's an idea! Behemoth! One, Two, Three! A doctor! Will you talk such nonsense in the future? No, I won't! Give his head back! What are your orders, Messire? Well, now, they're people like any other people... They love money, but that has always been so. Mankind loves money. They're soft in the head... And compassion sometimes tugs at their hearts. Ordinary people. In general, similar to those who came before them. Only the housing problem has corrupted them. Put the head on. Hop! One... Two... Three! Off you go! It's more fun without you! My head! Oh, my head! Give me back my head! All righty! Now that we've got rid of that... bore... Let's... let's open a shop... for the ladies! Our firm will change your old dresses, absolutely free, for Parisian models, and for Parisian shoes, bags, perfumes, a-a-and... Welcome! We welcome our Ô¨Årst customer! Madame! Please sit! Let's start with the shoes, madame. They won't pinch? What? What did you say, Madame? Please. Meow! Please! Here, please. - Thank you! - I won't allow it! Philistine! Don't break my arm! My wife has a cold! If possible, can you give me something for her? Here's my passport! Here's the stamp, I'm married! I trust you! I trust you as much as I trust myself! Here's a pair of silk stockings for you! Oh, how I guessed! About Yeshua and Pilate. I have only one regret. That instead of that Berlioz it wasn't the critic Latunsky. But you yourself are to blame for it all. You oughtn't to have behaved so casually with the consultant. Impertinently, even. But who is he, actually? You're not going to get upset? No. No! Who is he? Fine. Yesterday at the Patriarch's Ponds you met Satan. That can't be! He doesn't exist. Good heavens! Anyone else might say that, but not you. You were apparently one of his Ô¨Årst victims. You're sitting, as you yourself understand, in a psychiatric clinic, yet you keep saying he doesn't exist. But how disappointing it is that it was you who met him, and not I. But what do you need him for? You see, it's such a strange story. I'm sitting here for the same reason you are. Namely, on account of Pontius Pilate. You see, a year ago I wrote a novel about Pilate. You're a writer? I am a master. She sewed it for me with her own hands. And what is your name? I no longer have a name. I renounced it, as I generally did everything in life. Then at least tell me about the novel. Oh, those were the days! The extraordinary smell of the lilacs! And I was feeling light-headed with fatigue. And Pilate was nearing his end... She was carrying some of those... repulsive... yellow Ô¨Çowers. And I was struck not so much by her beauty, as by an extraordinary loneliness in her eyes, such as no one had ever seen before! And soon, very soon, this woman became my secret wife. She used to come to me every afternoon, but I would begin waiting for her in the morning. No one knew of our liaison. Whenever she came, roses that we both loved, were waiting on the table. She said I would be famous. She encouraged me, read what I wrote again and again, and it was then that she began to call me a master, and said that her life was in this novel. But when the novel was finished... and I went out into the world, holding it in my hands, my life ended. Everyone was too scared to publish it. Only one editor published a big excerpt from the book. And that's when the big hunt began, like I was some literature wolf. I'll poison the critic Latunsky! And then I was possessed by fear. Every cell of my body was gripped by fear. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What... What have you done? What have you done? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I hate this book! What have you done?! I'm sick! I'm scared! Do you understand? Do you understand that I'm going to be arrested? Go away! Go away! Go away! No! No! - Go! - No! And she left. And I was arrested the same night. This is the fourth month I've been here. Professor Stravinsky saved me from interrogations by saying that I'm mentally ill. He said that only a mentally ill person would write a novel about Christ and Pilate these days. Woman. May I have some water? Water! Cold water! Clear the way for the Roman warriors! Yeshua! It's me! It's me, Levi Matthew! Can you hear me? It's me! Levi Matthew, your... faithful and only disciple! I'm with you! I'll help you! I'm praying... that death may take you as soon as possible. Oh, God! It's too late! Forgive me, Yeshua! I wanted to relieve your suffering! I curse you, Levi Matthew, who let Yeshua go alone. I curse you, father and mother, for bringing a fool into the world. I curse you, God! You are unjust! I don't believe in you! Tell me, is there any other God, who would allow Yeshua, a man like him, to be burnt by the sun on the cross? I was mistaken! No! You are not the almighty God! You are a black god! A god of evil! I curse you! A god of robbers... their soul and protector! Hail! The Procurator has ordered the removal of the troops and cavalry. Two men follow Rat Slayer. The rest go with me. What do you want? Why have you come to me? Drink! Injustice! I'm a robber just like him! Give him a drink. Praise the magnanimous Hegemon! God! You've heard me! For... Forgive me! Send lightning to Yeshua's cross! [chanting in Hebrew] What-what-what? What's going on? What? Why are you naked? Oh, my sweeties! I knew it. I knew it! It's time to call the police! Don't call, Rimsky, anywhere. Hello? Hello! It will... be bad. Varenukha? That's you? Where have you been? Why didn't you call me? What's all this about Yalta? Yalta, goddamn it! He's in a tavern. Got drunk... with a telegrapher. They started acting up, sending telegrams marked "Yalta". Well, all right, all right... Finally, we'll get rid of Likhodeev. Where is he now? Well, he's sobering-up in a cell now. Thank you, Varenukha! Oh, thank you, Varenukha! You've guessed, damn you! Leave me alone! Go! Keep away! Keep away! Mummy! Oh, mummy! Keep away! Keep away! Go! Go! Go! Go! He-e-e-e-e-lp! Where did you get the currency? As God is true, as God is almighty, he sees everything, and it serves me right. I never laid a Ô¨Ånger on it, never even suspected what it was, this currency! God is punishing me for my iniquity. I took! I took! But I took ours. Soviet money! Don't play the fool, citizen Bosoy. You should tell us how the money got into your lavatory. It must have just appeared there by itself. Your lies... only make the situation worse. That's what I want, to suffer for my iniquity. Don't you feel ashamed? You are a Party member, aren't you? Why did you enter the Party? For personal gain. Now, you've started telling the truth. If you want me to, I will eat the dirt. I didn't take the money, I swear! And Koroviev! He's a devil! All right, enough! Stop playing the fool! There he is! There, behind the bookcase! He's grinning! And I can see his pince-nez... Get him! Spray the room with holy water! BERLIOZ LIKHODEEV Well, come in then, since you rang. I am the manager of the buffet at the Variety Theatre. No, no, no, no, no! Not another word! Never, and by no means! Nothing from your buffet will ever pass my lips! I, my esteemed sir, walked past your stand yesterday, and still I am haunted by the memory of the sturgeon and the feta cheese! My precious man! Feta cheese is never green. Someone has tricked you. It ought to be white. Sorry, but I've come about something else. Sturgeon has nothing to do with it. What do you mean, nothing to do with it, when it's spoiled! They supplied sturgeon of the second freshness. My dear fellow, that is nonsense! What is nonsense? "Second freshness" - that's what is nonsense! There is only one freshness - The Ô¨Årst. And it is also the last. If sturgeon is of the second freshness, that simply means it is rotten. Well, I beg your pardon... I cannot pardon you. Huh. Sorry, but I... have come about something else. Yesterday you were so good as to do some conjuring tricks... I? Good gracious, it's somehow unbecoming... even for me! Yes? What about the seance of black magic... I have to reveal a secret to you. I'm not an artiste at all, I simply wanted to see the Muscovites... en masse. Among other things, there were banknotes Ô¨Çying down from the ceiling. So they... snatched them all up. And then a young man came to my buffet and gave me a ten-rouble bill. I gave him eight-Ô¨Åfty in change... - Then another one - - Also a young man? No, an older one. Then a third, and a fourth... I kept giving them change. And today I went to check the cash box, and... suddenly... instead of money, there's just cut-up paper. They buffet is a hundred and nine roubles short. Surely no one thought those notes were real? Or do you think they did it on purpose? Can they be cheats? Can there be dishonesty among the Muscovites? This is so mean! So mean! You are a poor man. How much have you got in savings? Two hundred and forty-nine thousand roubles, in Ô¨Åve savings banks. Well, that's no great sum. Though, as a matter of fact, you have no need of it anyway. When are you going to die? Nobody knows that and it's nobody's concern. Sure nobody knows. The binomial theorem, you might think! He's going to die in 9 months, next February, of liver cancer, in the First Moscow State University clinic, ward number four. And I wouldn't advise you to go to the clinic. What's the sense of dying in a ward to the groans and wheezes of the hopelessly ill? Isn't it better to give a banquet on the two hundred and forty-nine thousand, then take poison, and move to the other world to the sounds of strings, surrounded by drunken beauties and dashing friends? However, now we're day-dreaming. To business! Show me your cut-up paper. This is it. My dear, you really are unwell. And if it... again... that is... Well, then come to us again. You're always welcome. Citizen, you are simply rolling in money! - Give some to me, eh? - Leave me alone, for God's sake! All right, all right! Go to the devil! I was only joking! What a building we've got! This one's even drunk in the morning. Devil knows what a house is this! We don't want the likes of you here! What do you want now? I forgot my hat... What's that? It's not mine! What? You came without a sword? Of course! Are you... Thank you very much! If you're in exile, why don't you send me a message? Like other people do. Or did you fall out of love with me? But I don't believe it. Oh, Devil, I'd give my soul just to know if he's alive. They're burying Berlioz, Mikhail Alexandrovich. The late chairman of Massolit! Yes, they're in a funny mood. They're accompanying the deceased and thinking only about... what happened to his head. So those are writers... following the cofÔ¨Ån! Naturally they are! Tell me, among those, is the critic Latunsky there? There he is, in the fourth row. And I can see that you hate this Latunsky! Yes, and someone else too. But I'd rather not talk about it. Oh, well, of course then let's not talk about it, Margarita Nikolaevna! Do you know me? I don't know you! Of course, where could you know me from? But I've been sent to invite you for a visit this evening, to a very distinguished foreign gentleman. Who are you? Well, all right, my name is Azazello. But... do you know anything about him... the Master? Well, suppose I do! I implore you, for God's sake, tell me one thing... is he alive? Oh, yes, yes. Oh! Please, madam. control yourself! I'm sorry! But, you must agree, when a woman is invited in the street to pay a visit somewhere - The foreigner to whom I'm inviting you is not dangerous at all. And I guarantee you that not a single soul will know of the visit. And what does he want me for? You'll Ô¨Ånd that out later. And... what kind of foreigner is that? Oh... I understand... I must give myself to him... I assure you, there isn't a woman in the world who wouldn't give anything to do just that. But I must disappoint you. It won't happen. But you can use the opportunity to Ô¨Ånd out about him there. About the Master? I'll go! Please accept this, then. Hide it! Hide it now. The passers-by are looking. Tonight, at exactly half past nine, take off all your clothes, and rub your face and your whole body with this ointment. At ten, I'll call you and tell you all you need to know. - Got it? - Got it! What a cream! Yes? Margarita Nikolaevna, it's time. Dear, dear Azazello! Fly... fly over the city a little, to get used to it, and then head south, out of the city, straight for the river. You're expected! I will! I'm free! I'm free! I'm free...! Look! Look at that! Look! House of Dramatists and Literary Workers. Latunsky lives here! Margarita Nikolaevna! Margarita Nikolaevna! Please! Let me introduce myself. Koroviev. Please! But the most amazing thing is... that there's room for all this. Margarita Nikolaevna! You're an intelligent woman, and of course have already guessed who our host is. Messire gives one ball annually. The spring ball of the full moon, or the ball of the hundred kings. Such a crowd! The ball will be magniÔ¨Åcent. We will see people who, in their time, wielded extraordinary power. But, really, once you think how microscopically small their influence was, compared to that of him to whose entourage I have the honour of belonging, it seems ridiculous, and even, I would say, sad... Yes, yes, yes... And, besides, you are of royal blood yourself. Why of royal blood? Ah, my Queen, questions of blood are the most complicated questions in the world! A hint: one of the French queens who lived in the sixteenth century would, one must suppose, be very amazed if someone told her that after all these years her lovely great-great-great-granddaughter would be led on my arm yes... through the ballrooms of Moscow. But we have arrived. What is this? We must! We must, my Queen. No use protesting. Allow me to give you a last piece of advice. Among the guests, there will be different sorts, oh, very different. But no one, Queen Margot, I beg you, should be shown any preference! Give each a little smile, or a tiny turn of the head! Anything you like... but don't ignore them. They... won't like that. It's time! It's time! The ball! Monsieur Jacques and his wife. A conÔ¨Årmed counterfeiter, a traitor to his government, but a rather good alchemist. Famous, for having poisoned the king's mistress. - Queen... - The queen is delighted! We're delighted. Earl Robert, interesting as ever. Note how funny, Queen. Now the reverse case... This one was the queen's lover and poisoned his wife. We're very glad, Earl! I'm delighted. She's so green! This charming and respectable lady is Madame Tofana. I commend her to you. Extremely popular among young, lovely Neapolitans, as well as the ladies of Palermo, especially those who had grown weary of their husbands. What is this on her foot? And why that green band on her neck? On her foot there's a Spanish boot. How happy I am, kindest Queen, that the high honour has fallen to me... I am very glad. The Queen is delighted. The wives wanted to poison their husbands, so the prison guards strangled Madame Tofana. - Ah! Really? - Yes, yes. This one is a boring woman. She adores balls, and dreams of complaining about her handkerchief. What handkerchief? She has a chambermaid assigned to her, who for thirty years has been putting a handkerchief on her night table during the night. What handkerchief? A blue-bordered one. You see, when she worked in a caf√©, the owner once invited her to the storeroom, and nine months later she gave birth to a boy. She took him to the forest, stuffed the handkerchief into his mouth, and then buried the boy in the ground. At the trial she said she couldn't feed the child. Ever since, when she wakes up, the handkerchief is there. She's tried burning it, and throwing it in the river. But nothing helps. And where is the owner of the caf√©? Queen, what, may I ask, does the owner have to do with it? It wasn't he who smothered the infant in the forest! Scum, if you allow yourself to interfere in the conversation again... Queen, my ear will get swollen. Why spoil the ball with a swollen ear? Release my ear, it hurts! I am happy, Queen-hostess, to be invited to the great ball of the full moon! And I am glad to see you, very glad. Do you like Champagne? What are you doing, Queen? The queue must keep moving. Yes, I do, Frieda. My name is Frieda, Queen! Frieda! Get drunk tonight, Frieda, and don't think about anything. The Queen is delighted! Cardinal Richelieu. Your Majesty! Napoleon Bonaparte. Attention, please.... Peter I. We are delighted! The Queen is delighted! We are delighted! I am charmed, my Queen. We are delighted! Lord Macbeth and his wife, Lady Macbeth. We are delighted! Mazeppa. We are delighted! The High Priest of Israel, Caiaphas. We are delighted! Judas, the Traitor. Ulyanov Lenin. I'm glad, my Queen, to be present at the ball. Very glad! Joseph Stalin. I'm delighted by you, Margarita Nikolaevna. Generalissimo! I wish you all the best. We are delighted! Adolf Hitler. Heil! But these two are still alive! They got special invitations. We are delighted! We are delighted! We are delighted! Queen! Freida! Freida, my Queen, Freida! Freida, my Queen! Freida! Mikhail Alexandrovich. Everything came to pass, did it not? Your head was cut off by a woman. The meeting didn't take place. I'm living in your apartment. That's a fact. You thought that, upon the severing of his head, life ceases in a man. There is a saying, unto each will be given according to his faith. Let it come to pass! You cease to be, and I will... joyfully... drink to existence... from the goblet into which you shall be transformed. One second, Messire! There is a man at the ball, who is eager to die... out of turn. Ah... my dearest Baron Meigel! Incidentally, Baron, rumours have spread about your extreme curiosity. What's more, wicked tongues have already dropped the word - that you're an informer and a spy. And, further, it is hinted that this will bring you to a sorry end within the month. So, in order to deliver you from this painful anticipation, we have decided to come to your aid, taking advantage of the fact that you invited yourself here specifically with the purpose of spying and eavesdropping wherever you can, to report wherever you need. Drink! Well, did they tire you very much? No, Messire. Is that vodka? Good heavens, Queen, would I allow myself to pour vodka for a lady? This is pure spirit! Drink boldly. Well... How was this exhausting ball? Stupendous! Everybody's enchanted, infatuated, crushed! So much tact, so much skill, charm, and loveliness! - It's time to go. - What's your hurry? It's late, Messire. Goodbye, Messire. Sit. Perhaps you want to say something before you leave? No. Nothing, Messire. Except that... if you still need me, I'm willing and ready to do anything you wish. That's right. Never ask for anything! Never for anything, and especially from those who are stronger than you. They'll make the offer themselves, and give everything themselves. And so, Margot, what do you want, for having been my hostess tonight? I want them to stop giving Frieda that handkerchief with which she smothered her baby. Will you do it? Absolutely not. You will do it yourself. And will it be done at my word? Just do it. What a pain! So? Frieda? Frieda. Frieda! You are forgiven. The handkerchief will no longer be brought to you. That doesn't count, I did nothing. What do you want... for yourself? Beautiful lady, this time I advise you to be more sensible! Or else fortune may slip away. I want my beloved Master to be returned to me, right now, this second. You... You... Tell me, why does Margarita call you a master? That is an excusable weakness. She has too high an opinion of a novel I wrote. - What is this novel about? - It is a novel about Pontius Pilate. About what? About whom? Now? At this time? Couldn't you have found some other subject? Let me see it. Unfortunately, I cannot, because I burned it in the stove. Forgive me, but I don't believe you. Manuscripts don't burn. It's here, the manuscript! It's here! He's all-powerful! All-powerful! Well, Margarita Nikolaevna, It has all been done. Do you have any claims against me? No! Why on earth... I wish you happiness! Farewell! Goodbye. Goodbye. Health and joy to the Procurator! I await the Procurator's orders. Never mind about orders until you sit and drink some wine. The last question. It concerns Judas of Karioth. Today I've received information that tonight he will be murdered. This information... I do not have. May I be so bold as to ask who supplied it? It doesn't matter. His death will come tonight. I have a presentiment, I tell you! Never once has it deceived me. Money! Money! Let go. Get off! Niza! Niza! Ah, it's you, Judas. I didn't recognise you at first. That's good, though. My people believe that if someone is not recognised, it's a sign he'll get rich. Where are you going, Niza? And what do you want to know that for? But why? We had it all arranged. I wanted to come to you. You said you'd be home all day. Ah, I was bored. You're having a feast, and what am I supposed to do? Sit and listen to you sighing on the terrace? - Niza - - And, on top of that, be afraid that the serving-woman will tell my husband about it? No. I decided to go out of town and listen to the nightingales. How, out of town? Alone? Of course, alone. Niza, let me accompany you. Why are you silent? - Won't I be bored with you? - Why would you be? Well, all right. Come along. Wait... let's go into this yard and arrange it. - Niza... - Wait. Go to the olive estate, to Gethsemane, beyond the Kedron, understand? Fine. But I'll go to see my family quickly. All right? They're expecting me for a feast. Ah, no. I'm not going to wait for you! All right, all right, all right. Sorry, sorry. Fine. I'll go ahead, but don't follow immediately. Keep a distance from me. Be patient, wait here. Niza... Niza! Niza! How much did you get? Speak, if you want to save your life! Thirty... Thirty tetradrachmas! Here's the money! Take it. It's all I've got! Take it, but grant me my life! Niza... Banga, calm down. The head of the secret guard is waiting to see you. Call him. I ask to be tried, Procurator. You were right. I was unable to protect Judas of Karioth. He has been stabbed to death this night. I would like to have seen how they killed him. He was killed with great art, Procurator. Let's go to the burial now. When the secret guards, under the direction of my assistant Tolmai, arrived at the hilltop, one of the bodies was not there. Ah, how did I not foresee it?! A certain man... Matthew Levi. Yes, Matthew Levi. He was hiding in a cave on the northern slope of Bald Skull, waiting for dark. The naked body of Yeshua Ha-Notsri was with him. Did they arrest him? He is here, Procurator. Show me the charter you carry with you, on which are written the words of Yeshua. You want to take away... the very last thing I have? I didn't say "give" me, I said "show" me. There is no death. We shall see the pure river of the water of life. Mankind shall look at the sun through transparent crystal. There is no greater vice... than cowardice. Know, Hegemon, that I am going to kill a man in Jerusalem. You want, of course, to kill me? No. I won't be able to kill you. I'm not such a foolish man as to hope for that. But I'll kill Judas of Karioth. You won't be able to do that either. Don't trouble yourself. Judas has already been killed this night. Who did it? Don't be jealous. I'm sorry to tell you, he had other admirers besides you. Who did it? I did it. It is, of course, not much. But all the same, I did it. Such an interesting city, is it not? I like Rome better, Messire. Yes, it's a matter of taste. I have come to see you, spirit of evil and sovereign of shadows. Well, make it short. Don't weary me. Why have you appeared? He... sent me. What did he tell you to say? He has read the Master's work, and asks you to take the Master with you... and reward him with peace. But why don't you take him with you into the light? He does not deserve the light. He deserves peace. Fine, it will be done. And leave me immediately. And also, he asks... that she who loved him, and suffered because of him, also be... taken with him. Do you think we needed you to give us that idea? Fly to them and arrange it all. Come to your senses! Why do you have to ruin your life with a sick man and a beggar? Oh, you, you... Oh, you... Because of you I spent the whole night yesterday shivering and naked. I spent several months sitting in a dark closet thinking about one thing, about the storm over Jerusalem. I cried my eyes out. And you... when happiness has come to us, you drive me away. Peace be unto you. Ah! Ah, how nice! You see, you see! We're not abandoned! Ah, yes. Messire... sent you a bottle of wine as a present. By the way, it's the same wine that the Procurator of Judea drank. Pontius Pilate. Ah. Falernian wine. To Woland's health! Are we poisoned? Are we dead? In order to consider yourself alive, is it necessary to sit in a basement, and dress yourself in a shirt and hospital drawers? So... Romantic Master! He has read your novel, and asked to give you peace, and a chance to create. I want you to see your hero. For about two thousand years he has been sitting on this platform and sleeping, but when the full moon comes, as you see, he is tormented by insomnia. What is he saying? He always says the same thing. He has a bad job, and the moon gives him no peace. Let him go! Don't worry. He has already been taken care of. Well, now you can Ô¨Ånish your novel. Free! Free! He is waiting for you.
