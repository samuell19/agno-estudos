"Keep true to the dreams of thy youth." - Schiller (poet, playwright) This drama is a story of the growth of young ESPers who yearn for justice and sexuality. That legendary drama has come back Congratulations! Galaxy Award Winner! (Honorable Mention) The very miserable drama will now start! Things have somehow calmed down. Just where is everyone? I wonder if everyone got caught... Ah! S-stop! Strip off his clothes. Okay. Stop! Please stop! No, no... Ah! Stop! No! Ah! Boner. Even if you say you'll resist, your dick reveals the truth. I will take away your virginity. Strip off his underwear! No... No! Stop! No! Stop! Ah! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! No! How did it end up like this?! It started when I received that text message. That's right, it's a text message from Asami. It all started with that text message. Help me! What? Sae? Sae... Okay, let's go. Professor, let's call the ESPers to go to Tokyo. Indeed. Asami sent this text message! Asami No subject Help me Help me! Something must have happened to her! Sending her back to Tokyo seems to have been a mistake. Do you have any idea what happened? Sae might have been kidnapped. Kidnapped? What do you mean? Could you mean an enemy ESPer? You all became ESPers from the light from space that can only occur every hundreds of years. Ability: Foresight Naoya Yabe Ability: Teleportation Yosuke Enomoto Ability: Telekinesis Terumitsu Nagano Ability: Telepathy Yashiro Kamogawa Ability: Telepathy Miyuki Hirano Which reminds me, where is Miyuki? It is possible that Miyuki doesn't have her ability anymore. What?! What?! When we contacted her, she said she cannot hear people's minds anymore. That's when we investigated. We found out she now has a boyfriend. It's most likely she's not a virgin anymore. What?! That's why I made a hypothesis. Could it be?! If ESPers lose their virginity, their supernatural powers vanish. No way! Miyuki is not a virgin anymore?! Yoshiro, because you look at Men's Non-no too much, it has become like this. You must also not lose your virginity this way. You all were gathered for my research on ESPers and have fought many enemy ESPers together. This is all to prevent another incident like the Duluth tragedy from happening. Duluth tragedy... That's the incident where the ESPers killed each other in America. ESPers are drawn to each other. It may also be a challenge for us that Sae is kidnapped. The last time Sae sent a text message from her mobile phone was when she was about to attend her new school. Everybody, infiltrate the school where Sae attends and save her. Yeah! Metropolitan Shioman... Metropolitan Shioman High? So we'll infiltrate this place? You can't go Mr Teru. An old man can't enter school. It's alright. Alright? Sae goes to a part-time high school. Part-time? Team ESPer makes an appearance after a while! Everyone, it's almost 5PM. It's time for school. 5PM is already dusk. It's suspicious how late they start class. So Sae is also here... It's a weird school somehow. It's going to be evening soon. And there is a pussy crying somewhere! Good morning. And... Good evening. Okay, Yoshi! Let's go! I'm the only one who can protect Asami. Guys, we will protect the world! Yeah! Everyone is an ESPer! The Sex Pistols didn't sing about love Shota Sometani But I felt that they screamed for love and peace Telepathy Even today, that place that used to headline the newspaper Erina Mano As well as those precious smiles and tears Makita Sports Telekinesis Amounts to 50 nuclear plants that shake the archipelago 5000 times a year Motoki Fukami Teleportation That is the story of us who live now blowin' in the wind Reiya Masaki Foresight "Hey young lad, aren't we in a good mood?" Megumi Kagurazaka This incompetent generation is underestimating us Clairvoyance Let us be heard, let our voices resonate, Ken Yasuda Power to the people!!!! Let's destroy the silence Theme Song Yu Takahashi Director Sion Sono This makes me nervous. Besides, everyone seems good-for-nothing. ~ Grinding all out with irritation, let's go! ~ ~ Tightly grinding with irritation, let's fly! ~ ~ I feel so irritated! ~ You sluts. You look so bad! You sluts! Sluts! You're only cowards who can only flatter men with your mouths! Huh?! My tongue is better. Shut up! I am... ...better. Just check out my thrust! What's with that thrust?! This is how you do it. You suck. It's like this. No, it's like this! It should be like this. You should do this. No, it should be more like this. No, it should be like this. It somehow turns me on. I've got a half boner. Is Asami really in a place like this? Were you the one who ratted us out to the teacher about us smoking? It wasn't me! Really? Not a minicar, please! Not there! Just hold it right there! Stop! Are you alright? Yes. She is so cute. Violence is not to be tolerated. Shut up! Ah! Ah... Ah, more! Faster! Faster! What?! Come drive on my hill, too! Wow! It's heavy traffic! Ah! They're going in reverse. They're going in reverse. They're going in reverse. More! It's heavy traffic! They're going in reverse. Hey, what're you doing? Please go through the ETC! Everyone! Um, these are the new students in the class. Kamogawa, Terumitsu, Enomoto, Yabe, and the one who cannot be seen beside them. And another who cannot be seen. Is there someone else you brought along from Toyohashi? That's creepy. Everyone, get along with them. Boo! Boo! Only Shizuka is welcoming them. You should all follow her example. No, no, no. It should be like this! How long have you been doing that? More! Do it. There, there! Do it! No! There! Don't lick it! You should lick it back! Yes, that's it! That's it! That's it! Student Guidance Room With this ambulance, you won't even have to raise your ass. Then you can just shove this jelly strip wherever you'd like! Hey, hey, don't fight! Shake hands, come on. Shake hands. Good. Now leave! You girls just lick your candies! Don't catch a cold now! So, you're asking about Sae Asami? She has been absent for three days now. Is there a reason why? She probably doesn't like it here. What? She was originally not arranged to attend this school. She was supposed to be admitted in a school to prepare her for college, but she wasn't able to because she was rejected even without formal screening. And sadly, she landed here. Because this school is full of perverts, huh? She must have been frustrated not getting into the school she wanted. Even though she is the daughter of an acquaintance, I tried making things easier for her. Acquaintance? Ah, no, he's not really an acquaintance. I just saw him in a magazine. The hell's that?! Does Mr Kajimoto know that Sae is the Professor's daughter? Then, does that mean that everyone knows we are ESPers? Most likely. If that's the case, I'm worried about enemy ESPers. Everyone! So you were here. Ah! It's you! I'm the class rep, Shizuka Tachibana. Thank you for helping me a while ago. Ah, nah, don't mention it. I'm sorry that you had would have to face something like that on your first day of transfer. Is it always like that? Yeah, more or less... Is that so? Your class is full of horny, scary weirdos. Weren't you surprised to find out they were all girls? This school used to be only for girls, and it only became a co-ed starting this year. Even the part-time school was just made. Ah right. I've also prepared these for you all. Each student in our school will be given a minicar each. Here, have one. Here. Here. That's your minicar, Kamogawa. Ah... Ah! You'll over-pleasure yourself if you go too quickly. Then just slowly. The part-time class has different groups. Groups? There are three big groups. There have been endless disputes with each group. Shall I run this on you? Shall I run this on you?! At 100 kph! Shall I run this on you? I'll run this through your ETC. Saeko's girl gang group! Using sporty minicars, they lure people with sadistic pleasure. With the tires of their minicars, they sweetly run them on other's bodies. If one gets rammed with the minicars, anyone would feel so good like that. What're you looking at, jelly brain?! Ah... No! Haruka's hostess group! Even though they also use minicars, they use trucks, garbage wagons, and the like. With special vehicle-typed minicars, they entice people with heartwarming pleasure. To think those kinds of vehicles would be helpful, they do something like that with those minicars! To think those kinds of vehicles help in development of towns, they do those various things! Even to that point?! Karina's sex workers group! Unlike others who use minicars, they are the slippery girls who uses merch like Tenga and Iroha and with the magic of lotion, they give deadly blows of pleasure to the ends of those who have great grasp of the technique of using jelly strips. With what's called the jelly strip beauty massage, they do those various things! Ah! It's so messy! Ah! So messy! No! No! Ooh! No more! Feels good. I like it. No! Hng~ There's sex workers group and hostess group... That's damn astonishing! There were male students before. But those three groups are too terrifying that they all quit this school one by one. Could it be Asami also was caught in their disputes... Asami? Are you talking about Sae Asami? Yes. We are Asami's friends. We couldn't reach her so we became worried. I think Sae is staying near here. Do you know anything? I'm sorry, I don't know anything. Is that so... You see, Yoshi here is in love with Sae. The conflict of the three groups of part-time school. And we still haven't found the enemy ESPers. Just where is Asami?! Minicar... It's in plain sight. We were almost run over and killed! That startled me! What the hell was that?! Does it mean... Does it mean that someone's after us?! *A play on words to also mean, "salty pussy." Shioman High Morning. Good morning... Morning. Ah, 'morning. Morning! Ah, morning. Morning. Morning! Morning! And good night. I'm kinda worried. It's like something's going on. Just what the hell is this school?! It feels off! More importantly, just where are the others? Morning. Ah, no way! Ah, really? 'Morning. That was close... A little gap I feel so good... Even the jelly strips feel so good! I feel so good... Even the jelly strips feel so good. Me too... With my ability to see through things, I can see them all naked. I also feel so good... Even the jelly strips feel so good... It's only our second day and it's like this? He looks like a pervert having such an obedient face. Perverted four-eyes! I'm positive he likes whore houses. I've never been to one! What? Ah! Oh, no! No! Hey, stop messing around! Please torment me more! We'll use this next. Ferrari! What's going on! What's going on! Will you ride with me? Please run me over. Oh my~ Welcome. Nice. You horny old man... Baldy! My head's not the only thing that's bald. I'm also bald down there! Yoshi! What're you doing there? Come on over here! Don't just stand there. Come on! Please come here. Let's have fun together. Come over here. How perverted! I'm sorry! Ah, Oniroku Dan's works! Oniroku Dan Sex Training I'm sorry that you saw me wearing a school uniform like this... I'm gonna change into a bikini. Huh? What? Ah. Wait, Shizuka? What? Bikini? What do you mean bikini? Should I keep this school uniform on? Or... would you prefer to see me in a bikini? Ah, bikini. I'd prefer bikini. I'm sorry that you had to help me. It's a man's job to carry heavy things for a girl. Ah, put them here. Here. Here, here! Over here! Here, here! Over here. Here, here. Over here. Here, here. Here, here. I'll put them over there... Everyone's gone weird? That's right! They all suddenly got used to this school somehow. It feels like all of them found a place where they belong... I can't believe that each of the three groups who are in dispute found someone for each of them... What's wrong with it? Their showdown might be soon. Showdown?! We'll have a showdown next time! Yeah, yeah! Showdown?! Of course it is. Yeah, yeah! Bring it on! Yeah! Right on! I don't care what happens after this! We'll make it catastrophic! Catastrophic... It's the beginning of a great brawl! I don't care if you're going to regret it! Great brawl?! Fine with me. It's going to be hot! We should settle this while the class rep, Shizuka, isn't looking! Yeah, she has to be out of the way. Let's get this started! She's not watching, is she? Of course not! Shizuka! I can't let them do it! I don't know how catastrophic this will be! What will you do?! I'll stop the dispute. I'm the class rep after all. I should keep the class' peace! Class' peace... I want to end the class' crisis! I'll help, too! What? I would not let you go through something that dangerous alone! Besides, there's also Asami. Kamogawa... Ah! Why am I in a bikini?! How embarrassing! Umâ€¦. Your hands... S-Sorry! I'm saved because you caught me. My minicar is an eco-friendly car. Stop! Reverse. Ah, run in reverse, huh? Okay... Stop! Oops... Take off! Kamogawa, how fast do you want it? H-How fast? 10kph? 20kph? Or perhaps... 100kph? Ah, that speed is prohibited! It's speeding! You'll get arrested, you know? Faster! I like minicars. I also like minicars. That makes me so happy! My minicar! My minicar! It's actually a great miracle... that both of us are here. It took us 13.8 billion years to meet each other, huh? When I think about it, it truly is a great miracle. I always thought... that I was destined to meet you. Shi-Shizuka... I always thought it's our fate. Fate, huh? If it's alright with you, can we go and watch the stars together? Sure! Shizuka and I will watch the stars together. That's so romantic! I'm sure it's going to put us in such a great mood... Hey! Stop being so shameless, Yoshiro! What's wrong? Ah, it's nothing... Kamogawa, let's race them together. Okay. Here goes. One, two... go! Wait, Kamogawa! Catch me! Vroom! Hello, Kamogawa. Hello. Huh? What?! A-Asami?! ~ Let's drink morning coffee together ~ Why're you here?! Everything is fine as long as you're alright. Why are you all here in Tokyo? Why? Because you texted Yoshi asking for help. The Professor said that you might have been kidnapped by an enemy ESPer. That's why we came here to rescue you. What? Dad said that? Yeah. It was a huge uproar. Kamogawa, did you show Dad the text? Huh? Yeah. Jeez! Why did you do that?! Huh? Well, I just wasn't able to get tickets for Aburadako's concert Aburadako and I just texted you asking for a little help. Concert ticket? But either way, I was able to go to the concerts of Dark Continent Jagatara and Stalin's revival concert! ~ Let's drink morning coffee together ~ Why were you absent? I was just sick. Then you were not kidnapped? Of course not. The hell... Why did we come here for then? The hell. Bitch. What do you mean? It's your fault you came here! Then, guys. Should we go back to Toyohashi? I want you to run me over. I want you to run me over. I want to run you over. I want you to run me over! I want to run you over. Don't run her over. I want you to run me over! I want to run you over! Don't run her over. "Licking Mother"? Ah, it's "Licking Mother". Yoshi. Since we're here anyway, we should just enjoy school life here. Yeah! If we go home now, we'll just be losers! Okay, we'll stay here in Tokyo for awhile! Yeah! Classes are over already. So it's alright if you go home, Asami. What? I can't be with you two? It's okay, right, Kamogawa? You're not okay with it? No, no, of course it's okay. Thank you, Kamogawa. I'm glad that you're safe. Will you still come and rescue me? Y-Yes! The skies here in Tokyo are too bright that you can't see the stars. Yeah... But you can see the brightest stars. Kamogawa, look over there. That's the Spica of the Virgo. It's the triangle during spring... Kamogawa, look over there! The Skytree! Isn't it pretty that it's all lit up? Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What stargazing? Stop pretending to be nice. This girl really is in the way. Honour student? You probably are only thinking about sex. Hillbilly chick. You probably were sleeping around. Ah, hold on... I need to make a call. Okay. Be sure to come back. Yeah. Shut up, bitch. Slut. Ah, Asami is safe. I see. Then the enemy? Um, it seems it wasn't an enemy ESPer. Asami said she was sick that's why she was absent. Sick... Looks like she doesn't have any problems at school either. Looks like even Mr Kajimoto went out of his way to accommodate her. Kajimoto? The homeroom teacher. Sae's homeroom teacher should've been Mr Fukikoshi. What? You must be mistaken. Ah, right. He said that he knows you or something. Knows me? Oh, no... Kajimoto... Professor. Yeah. Akiyama. Go and check things over. Yes, Sir. Ah, I'm thinking of you in a corner of this... No, no, no! Akiyama, no! Captions are completely wrong! No! Stop! Stop! Well... Please don't make mistakes at such important timing. Yes, Sir. We lost this time. We did lose. Kajimoto... I wonder what's wrong? He seemed alarmed. Huh? What? They left without me? How could they?! Wait... Could it be?! That lewd minicar... Asami is... running it over on Shizuka... No! No! No! Or could it be that Shizuka... is running a minicar on Asami's body?! The tires' sensation... That car hood... Minicar! Minicar! It's running her over! Running her over! It's runner her over! Running her over like crazy! That naughty sigh... That sexy breathing... Being bent over then her mouth open... And being in agony? No! No! Stop! Stop! No way! Why did you ask me to come here? Please stop manipulating Kamogawa. Can't you tell that you're troubling him? Why do you have to say that? That's because... Besides you were the one who asked me to come with you to the concert of Aburadako. It's you who said I should text him. That Kamogawa sure sounds like a weirdo. He is. How about texting him? What? If you text him that you need help, wouldn't he panic? Sounds fun. That's why they came all the way here to Tokyo. You're the one manipulating them! Could it be that you've fallen for Kamogawa? I only think of Kamogawa as... What do you think of Kamogawa? What you think of Kamogawa. What do you think of Kamogawa? What do you think of Kamogawa? What do you think of Kamogawa? What you think of Kamogawa. What do you think of Kamogawa? What do you think of Kamogawa? I see... So that's what you think of Kamogawa... I see... So that's what you think of Kamogawa... Okay... So that's what you think of Kamogawa... Asami. It's your damn fault! You have no idea how much I have suffered! 'Morning. Huh? Nobody's here. What the hell? I came here for the girls. I can't see through anything. Ah, it's Shizuka. It says that if we want them freed, we should go to the gym! If we don't go, they'll upload indecent videos of Asami and Shizuka! What?! We have to report this to the Professor... Ah! Professor is calling! Hello? Asami has been kidnapped by someone. What?! So we were a bit too late... The one who is behind this is most likely Kajimoto. He puts up that fight to deny you ESPers. M-Mr Kajimoto would do that?! I can't believe it! No wonder I thought he was carrying such a suspicious umbrella! Even though we did research in the same lab in university, he completely opposed my ideas. Listen well. He is an... ...ESPer denialist. E-ESPer denialist? The hell is this? It's a Tenga! Now I'm really sure they were taking peep shots! He always bore a grudge against me as a rival, and persistently went against me. Most likely the reason he became a teacher there is because he knew Sae was attending that school. So he wanted to take revenge. My ESPer research has been recognized by the academia with your emergence and he most likely wanted to go against it. We're heading your way. Wait for us. But we have to save them as soon as possible. We will go on ahead and rescue them! Kajimoto is a cunning man. We don't know what he's up to. Be careful. Okay! Come on, guys! Let's go! Yeah! I'll be waiting, ESPers! So you're here. Please get out of the way! We don't have time to get in the middle of your dispute! Aren't you ESPers... virgins? I'm not. Teru? What is it, Yoshi? Don't you want to lose your virginity? What?! We'd be happy to help you with that... Really?! Really. This kind of chance only comes once! But we'll stop being ESPers if we lose our virginity! Who cares about that! Teru? We might forever be virgins if we let this chance go! Since they're offering something like that, of course we should just take it! To be honest... I never really wanted to be an ESPer! Ah! It's so frustrating! So frustrating! The senile old virgin man is crying. Hey, Yoshiro! What should we do?! I understand what Teru feels! Why are you hesitating? There's no need to hesitate. How about we all take your virginity away? Come... Come. Come on now. Lose it! Slimy power. I will save the world... The world... I will save the world... I will save the world... Come on. Let's go over there. No! If we lose our powers, who will protect the world?! Yoshi... Teru. We don't have to be sad just because we're virgins! That's the reason why we became ESPers! We were given these powers to protect the world! Yoshi! You have your Tenga, Teru. Didn't you say that whenever you use Tenga, it's just as if you're doing it with a woman? Yeah. That's right. I have my Tenga! That's right, Teru. Guys! We will save the world! Yeah! Oh well, we were so close. If that's the case, we'll take your virginity by force. Girls,,get them! Okay~ Are you also lackeys of Mr Kajimoto?! Teru, use your telekinesis to snatch their weapons! Yeah! No! That's not it. Sorry, force of habit. I can't move things when they're not perverted. Right... That delinquent girl likes to insert the minicar in a guy's anus! If that's the case, insert the minicar in their pussy! Huh? What?! What's more, that minicar runs inside them! Oh! How crazy! That's it, that's it! Come on, come on! Hey! Wait! My hand is moving on its own! Hell yeah! Alright! Give up already! He vanished! I'm here! You should fully worship my dick! Yabe, do it! You've cut your appendix, didn't you? How do you know that?! But it doesn't matter! Things have somehow calmed down. Just where is everyone? I wonder if everyone got caught... Strip off his clothes. Okay! Stop! Stop! No! No! Boner. Even if you're saying you'll resist, your dick reveals the truth. I'll take your virginity. Take off his underwear! No! No! No! No! Stop! Stop! Hold it right there! Guys! We won't let you take off his underwear! Even though it was tough, we made it in time! If that's the case, I'll take on all of you. Telekinesis, strongest destructive technique: Divine Fang Wind-Style Fist! Wow! That's amazing, Teru! Mr Kajimoto's only the one left. The Professor said we can't be sure what he's up to. Let's be careful. So it's the final battle. What's wrong? Go on ahead without me. I've prepared something just for this. This is a man's dream! It's probably something foolish again. Let's go and get him! Asami! Kamogawa. Are you alright? Welcome, ESPers. Our last opponent would only be Mr Kajimoto? It's not me, Kamogawa. Shizuka?! So you're finally here. I didn't want to fight you. The one who all of you will be fighting would be Shizuka. Everything was just a lie. The reason I let you all get entangled with the delinquent girl group is for me to get closer to you all. Was that all just an act? Is that also a lie? You said that it's fate that we met. I believed you! Why did you do that?! So that I can help with my father's revenge. I'm proud of my daughter. So you're Mr Kajimoto's daughter?! Takahiro Asami has messed with the life of me and my daughter. This is revenge! Kajimoto Theater: The Revenge! So it starts... Takahiro Asami believed in the existence of ESPers and starts his research. On the contrary, I believed in the science that ESPers cannot exist. I continued denying Asami's research. Of course, nobody believed the existence of ESPers. The academia and research societies all believed that Asami's research on ESPers was blasphemy. Then Asami stopped his research and went to Toyohashi. But! Hm? Ah, wrong card. This has nothing to do with the story. But! ESPers suddenly emerged and the situation suddenly reversed! Asami's research on ESPers have attracted attention in the academia and was quickly praised by people all over the world by becoming the leading research on psychics! On the contrary, I was made responsible for everything for driving out Asami from the research facility. And then... I lost my place and was fired from the research institute. Ah, I'm thinking of you in a corner of this room Hm? What's this music?! That's as far as you can go, Kajimoto! This is the end of this show. Look at the bottom of the screen. The end credits are rolling. What?! Akiyama, how much time left? 50 seconds left. My laundry just keeps piling up Your lives have always been wrong in the time allotment. As the countdown to the end of the world ticks You're also wrong this time. No, not yet! You snatched away my profession as a researcher! I see faces I don't want to see on TV and hear the annoying sound of the ambulances 40 seconds left. Give it up, Kajimoto! I'm gonna go on! Since this is a special, let me be the one that's gonna end it. Shut up! I'm sorry I can't fly It's all your fault! You drove me out as a researcher through the night sky and vowed to take revenge! You can do it, Father! That's why I made my daughter, Shizuka, close to you, to lure your ESPer group! 30 seconds left. Give up! I'm gonna go on! Give it up, Kajimoto! I'm standing at the convenient store drinking lukewarm coffee I'm the one with the lead role though. To think it's a special. while reading two random magazines Come on, hurry it up already. You can do it, Father! I can't sleep, I just wander around the rooftop Hurry it up already... Give it up already. Give up. Father, this is the wrong slide! Oh, it's wrong! It's wrong! This is also wrong! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Give up! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Give up already! My revenge is not over at all! It never ends! It's already the end of the show! It's your loss! Father! We lost. How can you say that? We lost, Father! No, no! No way in hell I'll end it like this! Like hell there's a drama like this! Father! Father! Like hell I'll make it end this way! The hell! It's the end, the end, the end... Huh? It's not over yet. Good job, Akiyama. Akiyama here... has finally completed her ability to roll the end credits. He completely lost. Yes. Hold it right there, you devils! I will give you my justice right this moment. My ways is in the crotch. Yes, my name is... Big Magnum! Finally here! It's over already, you know. What?! We still have one minute. What should we do? Why don't we... Play... Minicars together? Let's play together. 3... 2... 1... Start! Hey, let's stop being mammals already Hey, let's be reptiles already Ah, I launched five times already Like a rocket from NASA A koala climbing in the telephone pole A butterfly dreaming at the midnight poolside Where is your hero here?

I will help you any time Let's send the bear that is under our eyes in the forest and always be together alone Thank you for watching "We're all ESPers!" till the very end! Please support "ESPer" forever! This drama is fiction. All the names of people and institutions are fictional. The end!
