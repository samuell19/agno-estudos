THIS MOVIE IS A WORK OF FICTION. TO PREVENT THE ACT OF PERSECUTION FROM THE SINGLE DEFENDERS FRONT THE NAMES OF CHARACTERS, CITIES, AREAS AND THE NAME OF YOUR EX POTENTIAL EX, PARENTS, AND FRIENDS OF THE EX ARE PURPOSELY MADE FICTITIOUS. IF THERE ARE ANY SIMILARITIES, IT IS UNINTENTIONAL. DON'T TAKE IT TO HEART. RULE SINGLE COUNCIL OF INDONESIA I confessed to her. She rejected me. Told me she wanted to focus on college. The next day, she's dating a chemistry student. Damn it. But I've already moved on. Hey, Lip. I confessed to this one through Line. - I'm waiting for her answer today. - Seriously, through Line? Yeah. Why? Is there a problem? It's the era of social media. Well, there's no problem. Lip. But relax. I'm sure she'll say yes. My single days are over. Wish me luck. Hope they'd say yes to us. I'll open the path so that we won't be single anymore. My name is Agus, Agus Kurniwa. I'm a UNB student. A fourth year civil engineering student. The guys beside me are my best friends. And today we will do something that's quite despicable. Show ourselves off at another campus. This one is Bimo. He's from Yogyakarta. Wait. He's a Papuan man who was born in Yogyakarta. So the casing is Papuan, but the SIM card is 100 percent from Yogyakarta. This one's Doni, also known as Don Juan. Also known as Playboy. Known for having angel's smile with devil's heart. He's a devil. Girls are like a buffet to him. He tries everything. This one is Olip. He's the son of a soldier from Aceh. He's best friends with Doni but is 180 degrees different. - Hey, Gus. Sit down. - Are you crazy? This is so close. Yeah. Where's Bimo? What's with him? - Instagram, Don. - The cycle is always like that. Check their IG. Introduce yourselves. Ask her to meet you. Confess his feeling. Get rejected. Cry in the shower. I'm curious about you and Bimo. Since last year, you have been eager to find girlfriends. Good question. Why do I want to find a girlfriend so badly? Because being single is painful, General. - Where are we? - It looks like Lubang Buaya. Shoot them! Stop! Calm down! Wrong movie! That's not the story! The story goes like this. After being single for so long, I was actually chill with it. Until finally, two years ago... I hated graduation day more than Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day is just laughter, chocolate, and the intimacy of puppy love. After graduation, will you really marry me? Of course I will, baby. But if you're an old student with this degree of being single in the third semester, in the seventh semester, and still single at the end, on graduation day you'll realize how wonderful it is to receive love. CURSED SINGLE MEN Damn it. - Okay, he talked too fast. - It's better to be single. You're going to regret it. - Easy for you to say. - He's the one that said it. Easy for you to say! You have experience dating. I'm always single. For once, I want to be loved and to love someone. Do you think that I... - She's pretty, right? - The one with the glasses? You're right. She's not as pretty as Asri. - Asri is prettier. - Damn... Asri is the girl that Olip likes, but he has not confessed his feeling. Being around Asri would make him pass out. Asri's shadow once touched Olip's shadow after that, Olip had a fever. Jen. Jenna. Jenna. Hey. - Who are you? - Bimo. - Bimo who? - The Bimo from Line from last night. That's Bimo. - Yeah. That one too, I'll take one. - Just one? - I also want that one, ma'am. - Okay. - Rita? - Here you go. Agus? - Agus SMP 5? - Rita social class? Agus whose pants got lifted onto the flag pole? - Agus the clown? - Am I? Rita from SMP 5? - Yes. - Oh, my! How are you? - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. Sorry. I forgot. Let me introduce my friend. This is Lian. - Did you come here alone? - No, with my friends. Those two guys over there. Olip! Doni! Here. Wave your hands. The one waving his hand. You're not in the alumni WhatsApp group, right? Which WhatsApp group? There's no group. But I'll make it later. Hey, how about what's-her-name? - Your sister. - Guti? - Teh Guti. Is she still selling bread? - She still is. - Now she sells bread on Instagram. - I see. - Does she sell wheat bread? - She does. - She does? - Yeah. How could you sell bread but not sell wheat bread? Yeah, you're right. I'm a man that always upholds his commitments. - What commitments? - Commitment to our love. - What? Our love? - I love you to death. What do you say? What's wrong? - I just met my old friend. - Yeah, I saw you. The one from before? Then? It's like I'm falling in love. - You have to drink. - Sorry. Doni, right? - Do you still remember me? - Hi. - What are you doing here? - I already told you. My dad is the rector here. I'm happy to see you again so I can... Wait. Jenna. Listen to me, Jenna. Jenna. Listen to me, Jenna. My love for you is big, as big as Mount Merapi, the most active volcano in Yogyakarta. - How sweet. - I'm willing to die for you, Jenna. Die? Then just die. But don't die here, please. Jenna, do you think I'm joking about willing to die for you? Jenna, stay right there. Back up. I'll prove that I'm serious, that I'm willing to die for you. This is the proof, Jenna! I'm willing to die for you! Jenna! Security! There are UNB students here! No! Oh, my God. Before you beat us up, be hospitalize and die, may I know what's going on? Surprise... - I understand... - Security! Hey, we can talk about this? Calm down! What's going on? Don't act like vigilantes! There's a procedure to beat someone up! Thank God, a sane person. Excuse me, miss. There seems to be a misunderstanding. My friend suddenly got hit. Doni? Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. A security... Security guard? That's enough. Listen. Vigilantism is not a solo act. You should do it in a crowd! Watch out, there's a bomb! Run! Run for your life, everyone! Hurry up! After an anti-terror squad investigation, the bomb was only a toy. An old man was found dead in his rented house on the outskirts of B City. A group of citizens of Single Defenders Front did protest in front of the council building. The victim died after hanging himself. It is suspected the reason was because he'd been single for too long. They ask for the immediate cancellation of the rule "being single is haram." Do you agree with the rules of being single? The rule isn't the problem. What we have to pay attention to is the humanity aspects. Am I right? How come people are still single? The government has thought about this issue thoroughly, because there have been victims. That's why I plan to create a park for single people. Places were used for inappropriate actions. I'd turn it into a park called Kalijodo. - Am I handsome? - A regular face. Sorry. I have such a regular face, but it's easy for me to get a partner. - Do you have a partner yet? - Not yet. Oh, no. Don't be alone for too long. Find someone who's ready for marriage. Find one with a steady income like me. I'm ready for it. Miss. Where's Teh Guti? She's at the back. Why are you learning English? You've got a lot of posters in English already. They're just for display. I got them from an old caf√©. This Vin Diesel from Garut is A' Rahman, my brother-in-law. Gus, I have a new oven. And the instructions are in English. - I don't understand. - All right, go ahead. Don't overreact. You're the one that looks like an obese ghost. "Obese?" Did you just call me fat? I'll show you obese! Born 2,5 kilograms, now 2,5 tons. Teh Guti, my older sister. She owns a bakery with A' Rahman. - No. - What do you mean "no"? You're just right. - What do you mean? - Just right. - Just right. - Solid, right? - Right. - Like dough, right? - Yeah. - That's enough! Sit down. Here's my new bread. - Take a good picture of it, Gus. - Okay. This would be good if it's wheat bread. - Wheat bread? - Yeah. - Sellable? - Lots of bakeries are selling it. - You sure? - Yes. Okay. But, Gus, when you're on your college break I want you to go around the neighborhood wearing bread costume. That's unique. Right, Gus? Why would I do that? That's embarrassing. Embarrassed to wear that? Embarrassed to go around? - So, you're embarrassed? - I'll do it. - Are you sure? - Anything. Any bread is fine. Good. For now, Agus, help me set the gas for the oven. Set the gas for the oven. Why me? Why don't you do it yourself? - If it explodes, I'm dead. - Why don't you ask A' Rahman? If it explodes, A' Rahman is dead! I'll be a widow! - I'll have to sleep alone! - And it's fine if I'm dead? What's important is you two are happy together? I'll make wheat bread for you. Wheat bread is delicious. Yeah. All right. Where's the gas? At the shop. Over there. Get it by yourself. Move. - It might explode. - I hate you. What did you say? It's so hot. I want to take a bath because I'm hot. - Where is my towel? - What? Towel? You want me to touch you now? Oh, my. It's hot in here and she wants to touch me. - You want to be touched. - I'll touch you back. - Don't do it. - Towel! He meant "towel"! Gas! Not a towel, Gus! Get the gas! A hard to figure out divine mystery is how come average girls in middle school turn out so pretty when they're in college? Especially when they wear a hijab. Oh, my gosh, Rita. You're making my heart weak. What we just saw is... What was it, Gus? Inner feelings, sir. Whose inner feelings, Agus? You pay attention or I'll be lowering your grade to be the same level as Bimo. What do you mean, sir? Asri. Now, there she is. Asri. A hydrology student. She's smart and pretty. And what makes her even more special is that she's never dated before. This is what makes Olip's heart beat fast. His life on the brink of death from years of looking at her from a distance and experiencing an internal war. For the holy mission, which is introducing himself. Commander! The village was burned down by the Dutch. So many victims. Men, women, grandpas, grandmas, and kids. - And there are also girls. - Okay, corporal. You save the others and I'll save the girls. - Why can't I save the girls? - Be quiet! That's an order! Okay. Help! Help! - Introduce yourself, bro. It's time. - No. It's illogical. It's been three years. - I see you... - Don. - You know what my dad is like. - A general. So? That's the reason. I'm from a military family. Since our youth, we're taught to be perfect men. - Failure is not an option. - Oh, my God. Poor you. You had such an unhappy childhood. The point is, I can't fail in anything. - What do you mean? - Here's an example. I study and get a good score. It's easy, right? I'm in control. Meanwhile, if it's about girls, I'm not in control. Meanwhile, you know that introductions are the beginning of everything. That's the problem. And you all know that my feelings for Asri are already too deep for me to face something called failure. - Thank you. - You're welcome. But what if she's dating someone else? - World War III could happen. - Then introduce yourself to her. You're not like a son of a general. Bro, love has no meaning if she doesn't know. Bim. That's enough, Bim. Don't be sad anymore. Who's sad? Who's moving on? You think I'm sad because of a girl? Do you think I'm Olip? Actually, what he's doing has been proven empirically in the calculus. Bimo has a chance of 99,99 percent of being rejected. In the end, Bimo makes his population sample larger. So that he confesses his love to 10,000 women. Hey. But this one's different. I haven't met her yet. We've only been talking online. Chatting. - Let me see? - Do you have her picture? I don't. She's mysterious. - It's social media, after all. - Liar! - We just want to see her photo. - Let us see. I'll only show you a little. A teaser. All right. That's fine. There. What is that, Bim? It's only the picture of her back. It's social media, after all. So that I'll be curious. She's being mysterious, only shows her back. She's pretty and sexy even from the back. Be careful. From the back she might be pretty. But scary from the front. She might be so scary. - Watch out. There's Jonur. - How are you? In every campus, there's always this annoying guy. If the word "annoying" had a face, this was how he'd look. First, he's a liar. - Are you sure you like Olip? - Yes. What's wrong with that? Just so you know, if he takes photo of us, he can see our underwear. And his religion is unclear. And what's worse is that he's a rebel. - Really? - Yes! You don't believe me? Here's the proof. Olip! Come here. Come here. Second, he likes to spread hoaxes. Hello? Yes, sir. Did you get the 20 million rupiah? How much more do you need? Fifty? I'll donate it today. Don't put my name. Just use "God's servant". I'll send it now, sir. Yes, sir. Third, he acts as if he knows you and tries to act like a cool and fun person. - Lip, look! - What is it? - The one in the green shirt. - Which one? - That one. - You like her? Her powerbank is with me. Let me see that... - Let's hang out. - There's an earthquake. - What earthquake? - An earthquake. - Olip. - I need to meet my lecturer. - I'm going to the salon. - Salon? A pet salon. That's his tragic story. Please come again. - What are you doing? - This is called bread. Thank you. Please come again. Don't take that photo. That's from last month. You need to take a photo of this one. I made this from 5:00 a.m. It's a sacred bread. - Sorry. I forgot. - What are you talking about? - Hurry up. - Okay. That guy. You haven't prepared his coffee. - What's with you? - Doni? You called just in time. Hey. How do I get close to her? - Why Rita? - Well... How do I explain it? She's pretty, nice, religious. Sexy but halal. How do I say it? - Like the girl behind you? - A customer! Okay. Like her... That's her! Welcome, pretty girl. - What bread do you want? - Talk to her. - You're talking in English. - Say hi. I want to buy wheat bread, ma'am. - Wheat bread... - Teh Guti! Oh, no, Teh Guti! - What is it? - A' Rahman! - What is it? - His hand's stuck! Thank, God! What? Thank, God? - That's my husband! - His foot too! - What? - His foot too! Got stuck in the oven? Where's the knife? Oh, my God. Your husband. Oh, my God. - Seriously! He's hurt all over! - My husband got stuck! He's asking for help! Seriously! Take care of that! Where are you? No wonder your pants got lifted onto the flag pole. You are a troublemaker on other people's campuses. A basic physics formula. Liking and meeting the person you like, results in you getting very nervous. What about the wheat bread? "You"? That means... Thank God, I'm fine. No one calls me like that. - Wheat! - Wheat. I thought you, mom, wanted... Maybe you'd like other bread? This... Here's our Instagram page. - Here are the other menus. - Did you take all these photos? Yes. Did I do it wrong? They're cool. I'll need to change my boxers. It's rare for me to get complimented. The photos. I meant my photos rarely get complimented. - You only want wheat bread? - Yes. Do you have it? That's right. We're all out of wheat bread. - Oh, no. - Yeah. They're all taken. How about this? I'll ask for your number and I'll give you an update later. I just made the WhatsApp group for the alumni of SMP 5. - I'll invite you to the group. - Right. Amazing! Is this what it feels like to start getting close? That naughty kid, Agus! He lied that you were stuck. He said your head exploded. Oh, my! Someone said that getting to know love is like learning to swim. If we're tense, we'll drown and get carried off by our own thoughts. But if we're relaxed, we'll swim far into a world without boundaries. - Ma'am, I'd like to order. - Yeah. Wait. Miss Asri, your order is ready. - Thank you, miss. - Yes. Thank you. All right. Because Agus didn't concentrate yesterday, today I'll introduce you to my new assistant. This is Jonur, but he's going to need a lot of adjustments. - He... - Sir. I can do it. - Agus, help him out. - Yes, sir. Listen. The industrial engineering department will join us to learn about the technical mechanisms of making concrete. For the details, Jonur, could you ask the students to come in? Okay. I can do it. Come in. Calm down. It's true that they are relatively fresher than you boys. So you need to watch your behavior. Behave. Especially you. - Yes, sir. - Concentrate. Focus. Go on, industrial engineering students. You can go find your spots. - I fell. - Hey. Don't forget what I said. - Yes, sir. - Don't try anything. - You can sit here. - Thanks. Okay, you two, you can go find your spots. Yes, sir. Excuse me. - Okay. - What's your name? - Today's practicum... - Lani. Lani. What a beautiful name. For how to make the installation... Industrial engineering student? She's not your wife. Stand up. What's your name? - Lani. - Lani. - What a beautiful name. - It's not made from cireng. What's your phone number? Sorry, I'm listening to this. It's for the sake of data. I'm the assistant lecturer here. Write it down. The stages of getting closer. Introductions? Done. Phone number? Done. Phone calls? Frequently. Her status? She's still single. Home address? Done. The rest is... Oh, God. Help me, God. I want to get happily married, God. Amen. -Doni, I'm at her house -Gus, check this out. What are you doing? You're insane. If you're busy, you don't need to pick up my call. I can handle it too. Okay. I'm at Rita's house. What should I say? Rita again? You're sure want to date her? Yes, I'm sure. So what should I say? It's more fun this way. - Okay then. Have fun getting rejected. - Don! - Damn it. - What is it? - Damn it! - Oh, my God! - What happened? - That... There was a microbat that passed by. Yeah. At midday. But it was a foreigner microbat. Albino. They like to get it mixed up that it's night here and it's morning there. So they got jetlagged. - It's a tourist. - Yeah, there are bats at night. Because it's still natural here. There's a lot of greenery. - Really? - Yeah. - Come on in. - Right. You go first. In this moment, all of the poems, pick up lines, quotes from Shakespeare, Kahlil Gibran, Sahrul Gunawan, Chef Juna, Mario Teguh that I have prepared I forgot everything. Oh, my God, Gus. Oh, my God, are you okay? Anti, Inta, don't be like that! - Are you okay? - Rescue breathing. - What? - Rescue breathing. - Rescue breathing. Now? - Rescue breathing. All right, wait here. I'll go call the guys at the mosque. - Wait here. - I'm fine. - Are you really okay? - I'm fine. - Really? - Yeah, I'm fine. - It's wrong position. - Don't... Gus, my uncle wanted to have a son. But he had daughters. That's why the twins are tomboys. Oh, yeah? I've never met your uncle. Is your uncle home? My uncle and aunt are doing umrah. - Since when? - Yesterday. That means that you'll be living alone for quite a long time. Yes, Gus. Just the three of us, with Anti and Inta. Hey, remember. According to quantitative data, it's proven that the majority of people fail to confess because the filthy thoughts, rotten hearts and mouths, and their pervert eyes. - Your eyes. That's it. - There you go, Gus. Find positive things. Use soft words. Soft. The wheat bread is so soft. - Wheat bread is rough, Gus. - Idiot! No, I wasn't saying that it's soft in that way. But that it's good. - Okay. - It's good. - Enough. - It's nice and pretty. It's great and cool, when we spread jam on it. It makes it hard to eat it. What? This bread is from you. So you don't want to eat it? No, I will eat it. - I'll eat it now. - Yeah. Excuse me. Is it good, Gus? I'm sure it doesn't taste good. Doesn't taste good, right? - It's good! - I know you don't like it. I don't like it. It's okay. Sometimes you need to lie. Don't stop there. Rita gave it. Come on, you need to add more. Come on. It tastes like there's a symphony in my mouth. - That's it. - The jam is great. You're amazing at this. Chef Juna won't be able to make this. I'm going to keep this. I don't want to finish it all now. How long have you been studying at UNB? I think you meant UNJ. It's been around two years. That means that you'll graduate soon. - Yeah. - Then you'll be a manager. - You're going to become an engineer. - Compliment her. Yeah. But no matter how good an engineer is, their boss will always be a manager. There you go. I only go to college to expand my knowledge. Not sure I will work or not in the future. - They're dating? - Right now, I just want to focus on living a healthy life. That's why I like wheat bread, I manage the food I take. And I like to do yoga. Come on. Keep it going. Don't think too much. Be on her level! - I do that too. - Really? Yeah. I also like to exercise. And I think that exercise isn't enough. So I went straight to eat clean. I don't touch sugar anymore. Now I only eat natural things. Like eggs, cow meat. - Idiot! - Chicken. Just that. You shouldn't be like that, Gus. You should eat vegetables with a lot of fiber. Don't consume that kind of food too much. Because I think too much of me as a man, so I have to eat meat. But I also eat vegetables, any kind of vegetables. Things like rujak, asinan, sayur asem. I also eat all that. And meat. That's all. If it's possible, it's better to eat pure vegetables. It's more healthy. Like salad. I've been done it wrong all this time. - It's your fault. - Why me, Gus? If only you were with me from back then, I wouldn't be doing it wrong. There would be someone to tell me, "You can't eat this and that." But because you weren't in my life, then I've been doing it wrong. So that means that next time I eat vegetables, I shouldn't eat alone. I need someone to accompany me. But it can't be with just anyone. It has to be you. Maybe not just to eat vegetables. Maybe for... life? For anything? What do you think? - That's clever of you. - I'm serious. Why did you hit me? That hurts. Anti, Inta! You little devils! I'll marry you when you're older! It's because you're Rita's nieces! If you were Jonur's nieces, I'd put you in the police crime unit! Finally! - Ouch. - But I'm so glad that you're dating. You opened the gates for all of us! - Amen! - We're going to date! Amen. - Hey, why are there scratches? - What is it? - What else have you done? - What else have you done? We talked. You could also talk to your physics teacher. - Congrats, bro. Congrats. - Thank you. When are you going to do the same? Go date someone! As if I would, man. - But if you're happy, I'm happy. - He thinks he's so handsome. He thinks a lot of people want him. Agus! Gus! I came! How dare you! Gus! Hey! Agus! How dare you! Don't get involved. - We're friends. - Calm down. - Okay! - Hey. Calm down, bro. Hey, congratulations on dating. So this is what dating feels like. This is my favorite place. Me and my friends like to come here to hang out. And I think Firdaus Cafe fits you. - Why? - Because you're an angel. Firdaus means heaven. So it's like coming home. ICE CREAM Here it is. You have to try this. This is the most delicious coffee in B City. It's healthy. It won't make you fat. Wait a second. - Here. - No, thanks. I will drink juice. Why would you come here to drink juice? Just try it. It's good. Try it. - Is it good? - It's good. Yes! See? I'm right. It's sweet. I'll get diabetes. This is sweet, you're sweet. Oh, no, I'm getting dizzy. Dating makes your life more colorful. When I was still single, my daily activities were waking up late, meeting my lecturer, then meeting Teh Guti again. But since we're dating, I could wake up early, meet Rita, sneaking to her campus because of the incident, come to the class late, pick Rita up again, get hit by Anti and Inta, and get scolded by Teh Guti for coming home late. It's fun, right? - Gus. - B? - Gus. - Yes, what is it? - C. - Gus. Yes, what is it? D. - Never mind. - Okay! Where are you going? You're upset. What I meant by "D" is adik. Can I call you adik? I almost messed it up. - What is it? - Gus. I want to ask something. - It's important. - I'm doomed. She's definitely asking me to marry her. Not now. I have nothing now. I'm still living in a rented room. I'm still poor. Oh, no. Do you think I gained some weight? Honestly? Gus! Come on! Just run already! Hurry up! Come on, Gus! Come on! - No, you didn't. - Gus! - Gus! - You're lying. Fire! There's huge fire! Add more water! Fire! Gus! It's impossible, Gus. I haven't been eating clean lately. It's impossible I haven't gained some weight. Take a look at my cheeks. See? Why did you lie? Agus Kurniwa has tragically died and was found in the sewer. A civil engineering student. Gus! Answer me, Gus! Yeah. A little bit. How could you? Rita! Rita. Don't be mad, Rita. You can be mad, but at least let me take you home. It's late already and the rain is starting. It's the wrong direction. What if something happens to me? Won't you be sad? Rita! Rita, don't be like that. Forgive me. I was wrong. Let me take you home, okay? Wait. - Why are you mad? - I'm not! This is the way to start the scooter. That's how it goes for Vespa. It won't turn on! - Liar! - Why would I lie about it? - It has to be like this. - Just say you're mad! - Hurry up! - Okay. - I'll help you. - You don't have to. Help me, Gus! Here, wear my jacket. - It's cold. - No! - You'll catch a cold. - No! Okay? I'm sorry, Rita. See, it worked. It turns out dating is like this. Why is it different from dating in the movies? Eat that! I think I need to hurry up and confess to Lani. But I have to do it differently. It has to leave more of an impression. What should I do? I am the master of a thousand loves. Miss, you can't resist me. You're my soulmate. I've fallen in love with you Oh, Lani On the count of three, you'll fall in love with me. One... two... God has created everything in pairs. Lani! After the war, I will marry you! Get married! - No, Bimo. - What? Wait, I haven't said anything. - I already know. - Listen to me first. I'm serious about you. I... - I... - I don't want to date, Bim. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Love usually comes with hope. Hope then meets effort. But it's not rare that effort would meet disappointment and hopelessness. What's wrong? This is rare. He's usually not this sad. What is it, Bim? Why are you sad? I also don't get it, Gus. I think... I think I'm serious about this. Like, I'm not just messing around. Messing around? All those times of you confessing to girls, bringing a bomb and getting chased, going on television, being called terrorists, that was you messing around? Damn you. But, Bim, usually you're okay with rejection. You're right. But this time, it feels different. My head hurts. Like, I keep thinking about it. There's something in my head. Okay. Listen, guys. We're still young, right? And how about we go on vacation? Just for a little bit. Come on. Let's go to Bali, Bromo. We'll get there by train. It's fast, easy, and cheap. - I can get us a place. - Well, we can't, Don. We can't buy train tickets online. - Must go to the train station. - We can. - Buy it from... - Look! - Seriously? - You can book a place to stay. - Come on. - Amazing. Massages, licking. Hey! Are you crazy? You're telling us to bathe cats? I've headaches having a friend like you. If you want to be a friend, use your brain a bit. You're just bothering people. My head hurts. - What's wrong with you? - You should be helping me. We could help you if you weren't like this. Lip. Yeah. Building Number One. Now, okay? Asri's here. Asri's been there for a while. - That's why I called you. - Okay. Then me and my friends will go to your village. - Of course, sir. - Just be yourself. All right? You're welcome. Okay. Yes. Thank you, sir. Good afternoon! With me, engineer Agus at The Talk of Love Techniques! We have a very special guest today. An engineer expert of intimate relationships and the technique of being a playboy. Here he is, engineer Doni! ENGINEER DONI TRUMP GUEST Engineer Doni, in your opinion, what do you think will happen to this couple? Excuse me. Yes? What is it? Can I get to know you? Olip. Civil engineering. Subject A made a fatal mistake here that increase the probability of failure. Subject A started getting to know her without an intro. That's dangerous, without a connection Subject B can't see the credibility of Subject A. Subject B might think of Subject A as a psychopath. Sorry. I'm not in the mood for introductions. Subject A will experience his teeth feeling itchy, his head hurting, the feeling of wanting to dive into the deepest well. Because the blood isn't flowing to his head but is flowing all the way down, so his brain won't be working optimally. The functions. ...which is forcing himself on her. Your name is Asri, right? Let me get to know you. You knew my name. There's no need for introductions. And the longing for three years was ruined within a second. Like this. This is to loosen your muscles. - So it's like this. I know this. - Yeah. No! You're not done yet! - It hurts, Rita! - Come on, Gus. Come on. Your legs should be wider. You should bend down more. Look at the camera, Gus. I can't do this! Slowly. Take a breath. That's it. No, put your hands over here. Hold it, okay? One more time, Gus. Higher. That's not straight enough! Gus, do it right! It's for Instagram! - Hold it, Gus! - Rita, that's... Rita! Babe, have mercy on me! Oh, my God! Who wants to buy? How are the photos, Rita? They're great, right? Oh, my gosh, Gus. None of them are good. They're all bad. You're not smiling in any of them. Look. This won't look good on Instagram. I think we need to start from the beginning, Gus. Oh, my gosh. Dating should make you happy! Not like this! RITA, COME TO THE BEACH WITH ME. WITH DONI, OLIP, AND BIMO. WE'LL EAT GRILLED FISH. OKAY? NO. I HATE THAT. AND YOU CAN'T GO!! YOU'RE SAYING BAD WORDS, AREN'T YOU? What are we doing here? Come on. The fish are ready! They're burnt just like you! I'll catch up with you guys! I still want to enjoy nature! Hey, Bim! Be careful! There are sea urchins! The sea urchins are there! I want to go here! It's safe! What's with him? Is his brain broken or what? Or, is he... Don, Lip. Something's wrong with Bimo. He's different, right? Don't say he wants to suicide. I see Mother Pertiwi I'll check on him. Having troubles in her heart I'm doomed. Don, I've been thinking. I got an idea. What if we use a high school tactic? The tactic we used when we were still in school. - Tactic during school days? - Yeah. - What for? - For Asri, of course. So, you get to know her, and then you introduce her to me. What do you think? - Hello? - Hello! - Yes? - Where are you? It sounds like strong winds. We put the oven is outside. We're using a technique from Sweden. If it burns, the fire will follow the wind. So the fire will spread... Find something in common. Asri and I lack any commonalities. If you get to know her, me and Asri will have something in common. You. My best friend. This is what you want? Forest, fields, mountains, the sea So the bread will be cooked evenly. So that it's natural. Why does it sound like water? And someone singing? Yeah, we're using the Eskimo technique on this one. We're baking bread by putting water to the flour so that... Sounds like the kitchen is outside. - What? Hello? - Hello? - Gus! Hello? Gus! - What? The connection is bad. And pray Don! Lip! - Help! - Bim! Don't come here! There are a lot of sea urchins! Why is the sign over there and the sea urchins here? Why? Bastard! Bim! Oh, no. It's all right. It looks good. - Doc, please fill in the data. - Right. Okay. You only need to take antibiotics for three days. - And that's it. - Nurse. - Right, sir. - Hello? - Thank you, doctor. - Thank you. Get well soon. I'll be back tomorrow. - Don't forget. - Thank you, doc. - You're welcome. - Doc. - Yeah. - So how is it? Relax. Your friend will get better soon. Okay? All the allergies will go away. Even the ones on his face. You see, his face is scary. It'll become smooth again. It'll go back to being clear. - Back to normal. - Doctor. - Yes? - They didn't touch my face. Your face isn't... Oh, my God. I've never seen someone like him. If a sea urchin touches us, is it haram? Accepting them for who they are. This spell is very interesting. Who wouldn't want that? Meanwhile, does Rita really accept me for who I am? Guti, this is no longer balanced between what you made and the result. No. My job is to make the bread. Your job is to think how to sell. - You have to balance it! - I can't! I have to innovate every day! Will I end up like Teh Guti and A' Rahman? After being sweet, they fight. Then they're being sweet again. What should I do? - What's the solution? - What solution, Gus? No... Can you help me distribute flyers? For promotions, Gus. So that we sell more. Why me? Why not A' Rahman? - A' Rahman is sick. - Sick? He looked just fine earlier. How could he suddenly be sick? You want to help me, right, Gus? Gus! That's why you shouldn't sleep during midday! - Gus, do you want to... - Okay! - Flyers? Okay! - Yes, flyers... How did he know? He's a good boy, after all. While I was being so stressed, something big happened in my life. What's that? Here. It's the socialization of food health. For students that skipped breakfast because is troublesome. They need rice, side dish, and milk. And that's too much trouble. That's why we made Teh Guti's bread. Sensible, healthy. The point is, it's great. - Could you help me out? - To put these up? Yes. Help me. Put it up there. Yeah. - Thanks for helping me. - Yeah. Yeah. By the way, this is for qualitative data what kind of bread do you like? - That hurts! - Yeah! Oh, my gosh. Okay. Sit down. Wait a second. Okay. - What is that? - Alcohol. I forgot. Sorry. Ouch. Wait a second. Wait for it to dry, okay? You're the concrete student, aren't you? People rarely remember. We are forgotten. I remember. Your dumb look in the front. The one who didn't know what to do. No, I'm just that type of person. I mean, that's how I look. I like daydreaming. I don't have a dumb look. I'm sorry about your finger. I never hurt someone like that. It's not my hobby, and I'm not part of the people who like to do that. No. It was an accident. All right. Hold onto this for a bit, okay? No. I'm not going to amputate your finger. This is for cutting the bandage to put on your finger. Hold on. Okay. Is it... - Is it too tight? - No. Do you have any bandages at home? - Yeah. - Can I have your name? - Don't hurt my finger. - I haven't wrapped it up. Wait. So Can I have your name? No. Unexpected love is always more powerful than a love that you've been waiting for. On the other hand, a love that was made up, full of scenarios, sweet words that are dramatic, it might result in being beautiful, dramatic, and interesting. But one thing's for sure, it's fake. This is the new creation of Teh Guti! Surely, it's Teh Guti's bread! - Yeah. - Guti. - Hey. - Hi, Lan. What happened to your hand? - Just the usual. - I want to show you something. Do you know about Teh Guti's Bread Instagram account? - Teh Guti? - Isn't this... Take a look. It's viral on Instagram. The bread looks good. The owner of the shop is a student of this campus too. He wore a cupcake costume. It's so interesting. Guti. Guti. Guti. Hi. I still don't know your name. Why are you asking? You want to hurt my hand again? That's not it. - Where are you going? - Lan! - We've got to go. - Hey! Wait. - What is it? - Her name is Ian... Who? - Don't tell him! - You heard that. Okay, how about this? If you tell me her name, I'll give you these for free. Teh Guti's bread. - For a month? - Good deal. - Okay. For one month. - Sure. It's a pretty good deal. You want to know her name? Come closer. Her name is Arlani Wirya Atmaja. - Arlani Wirya Atmaja. - Yes. - Ma'am, just let me see a little bit. - Agus. Students' data is important. It's classified. Not anyone can see. What do you want? Students data? A girl? Her phone number? No! Don't give it to him, ma'am. - Ma'am, I need students' data. - Sure. Students' data? Sure. Come in, sir. - Come in. - All right. - Sir, can I come in? - Go away! - Why did you let him in? - He has a reason. What do you want? Go away! Over here, sir. HANG IN THERE, BIM. I'VE BEEN IN YOUR SHOES. IF WE NEVER FEEL DISAPPOINTED, WE'LL NEVER FEEL HAPPINESS. YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHY I FEEL WE'RE CONNECTED, EVEN THOUGH WE'VE NEVER MET. You think I did that only to you? I winked at all the boys at campus and apparently, you're the only one who was eager to respond. Seriously. They're right. Being a security guard isn't great. It's a high risk job. What's wrong? Why do you even ask? Do you want me to stab you? Hey. Did you know that I've seen ghosts two times? You're making things up. I haven't met any ghosts yet. You've just been lucky! You'll see one if... And just now, I just saw a bread ghost. A bread ghost? There's no such thing. Go after him! Your costume is so cool. What are you selling? Sushi? Watch out for security. They might catch you. So cool. Where is the administration office? See? I told you. I saw her earlier. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE Ma'am. Agus! Oh, my God. Ma'am! Sir! What happened to her? What now? Sir? - Students data, right? - Yes. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING Thank you, Sir. Sir? Mr. Dean. Sorry, I don't have time to write a resignation letter. But I'm officially resigning from this campus. Oh, my God. I'm going to ask a serious question. Am I hallucinating or is there really a cake there? - You're not hallucinating. - Wait. I'm from Teh Guti's bread shop, here to deliver a message to Lani. - Is Lani here? - That one over there. This message is a song from her fan. I see the girl Who ran because her finger got hurt I hope her heart is comforted With a love that is tempting Never giving up That's my spirit Wait. I can explain. What are you doing? Are you mad? First, can you please take off this mask? I can't hear anything. What? Explain it to me. Is it not clear enough? Is it not clear enough? The reason for me wearing this bread costume and me liking you? Does it make sense? It makes sense, right? Okay, I like you. I don't know why. I keep thinking of you every day. When I eat, take a bath, I pray, I think of you. You disturbed my prayer. I find it annoys me, because when I think of you, I can't call you. I don't have a number, I don't know your full name and where you live. I don't even know when your birthday is. That's why I did this. One more thing. Please don't tell anyone about this. I mean, I'm using Teh Guti's bread costume. I'm afraid if something happens to my sister's shop and it gets closed. I would go to jail, can't continue studying. I won't be able to meet you. That's the most bitter part. A week is bad enough. Not to mention a year. Oh, my gosh. You... are crazy, you know that? You're crazy. The bread is crazy. Crazy for you. Gus. On the A, B, C part. It'll really help this village. Thank you. Cheating in order to be happy, that's what they say. I can also be jealous, Gus. But you already know who I chose. Then you decide it. I'll do it later, okay? Be patient. This means we've accepted each other. Okay? Soon. Here. You try it. Slowly, Gus. There. What do you think? It's good, isn't it, Gus? That's good for adding fiber to your diet. Here. Wait. I want to show you. White bread is dangerous for your health, Gus. Look at this if you don't believe me. - See? - You do know that I sell white bread. Yes, I know. That's why I'm telling you. It's better to sell wheat bread now. We can't do that, Rita. Teh Guti and A' Rahman baked them. I baked them. All of our hard work. Fine. Just do it little by little. You can start it. You stop eating white bread. I can't do that. Why would a white bread seller sell white bread but not eat white bread? I told you, just do it little by little. No, Rita! There's no way that I wouldn't listen to you. You're right. Why am I selling white bread? White bread doesn't taste good. Wheat bread tastes good and healthy. Form tomorrow, I'll sell wheat bread. I'll be the most wheat person here! Do you have wheat bread? You're mad at me, aren't you? - Just admit it. - Rita. White bread is made out of wheat. - No, flour. - That's been grinded. But the wheat germ is separated. Wheat bread is combined germ. It has more fiber but the texture is rougher. White bread is softer and great with butter. - With chocolate... - No more bread. So that you understand that... The point is, I always listen to what you want. You want me to call you or eat in a restaurant with amazing vegetables, I listen to you. That's the point. Now, let's go home. I'm mad at the scoter. I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at the scooter. I'm not mad at you. Lan? Can I talk to you for a second? Lan? Can I talk to you for a second? No, Bim. Hey, seriously. I won't do anything weird. I won't be loud. Just a second. Sorry, Bim. I have a class to attend. Hey, Lan. It won't be long. After your class, okay? Lan? Oh, my God. Not the cheeks. - I've missed you. - Really? - Yeah. - Where are we going today? I want to be somewhere that is not here. I know a perfect place for our date. - Is it safe? - Of course. Sorry. Since we're still backstreet, we need to be safe. - Whose fault is it? - Well... Right. I want to tell you something. There's this civil engineering student chasing after me. Someone else? He's also a concrete practicum student, we're on the same year. - Then he's my underclassman. - Yes, your underclassman. How dare he. Let me know who is it if you see him. Then I'll... Okay. Come on. There he is. No, no, no, no. No, no. No, no. - Him? - What is it? Yes, that's him. - The orange shirt. - Yes! - No... - What's wrong? He's my friend! Bim. - Bim! - Sorry. - Sorry. - Bim. What are you doing here? I'm looking for fish. You have to use a fishing rod, not a bow. A fishing rod takes a long time. This is faster. I can catch them right away. So, where's the fish? The problem is, I can't see the fish. The water is murky. - What are you doing here? - Me? - You. - I'm doing a survey. - What survey? - Soil mechanics survey. Why would you do it here? I want to do a study of the soil mechanics on this area. To see the possibility of land reclamation in the future. Land reclamation happens at the beach. Oh, my God. Bim. You don't know the future, right, Bim? Come here, Bim. The world of civil engineering isn't as small as we thought. There are areas and places to develop. Try to imagine the places here having tall concrete buildings. Try it. Try and smell it. Close your eyes. - What? - Can you smell it? - Smell of what? - Do you smell it? The smell of tall concrete. How hot it is. How warm it is. - Yeah. It's like the smell of concrete. - Yeah. - I can smell it. - Yeah. Just stay here. That's the toilet for the biology students. Just stay here. Yeah. Stick your tongue out. You're too much. That's too much, Gus. What? What are you doing? People think I'm weird but you're the weird one. Hey. You're going to accompany me today, right? - To do what? - To meet the girl that I like. Today? This very day? I made a promise with her to meet here. - What? Here? - So will... I meant in this campus! Why would we meet here? If we were meeting here, maybe I'm getting to know a ghost. If I'm getting know a ghost, she might be in those trees. Why would she be there? Smell it. Okay. I'm going to look for fish. It's difficult being someone who listen to your friends' problems while the problem is yourself. - So how is it? - What? About Asri! How is it? - Give me an update! - Smooth sailing. - Fine? - It's great. What do you mean? Did you meet her already? - Of course I did. - You did? - Did you talk to her? - Yes, about you. - Really? - Yeah. Everything. I told her what kind of person you are, about your studies. - Yeah. - Doni, my man. Or you are that friend they can rely on. And you failed to be the kind of friend. And then what? Her name is Lani. She's so mean. Agree to meet and they leave you hanging. I tried to change for her. I take a bath regularly, pray. I tried to manage my life so that she knows my efforts. What do you think is wrong, Gus? Is it because I'm from the eastern part of Indonesia that lives here? And I don't mean anything? I just want to talk to her, Gus. I just want her to give me a chance to talk, Gus. If she doesn't want it, that's fine, but give me the reason. We should talk first. Don't leave someone hanging. Here. Why did you bring a whip? Cheating is horrible. Really horrible. Especially if you're cheating with your best friend's crush. Why are we wearing these? Are we going to steal donation boxes? - Quiet. - Are you involved in something? You look good. - Excuse me. - Yes? I'm looking for Asri. Is she here? She already left. The water advocacy at Pulung Village. - Right. I know. - She went there with her friend. - Some guy. - Some guy? Seriously, what are we doing? Seriously, what are we doing? What do you think? It's a cool place, right? Come on. This place is safe from your friend. Have a look. Thanks. Stop by, sir. For who? - Buy two, get one free. - Buy two, get one free! - Gus. - Bim. - What are you doing here? - No. I'm here to be a better person. And I also wanted to buy a poster of Wali Songo. With her? Her? Who? No, we don't know each other. I get it now. I get it. I would've never thought That you'd do this to your friend You said we were close friends You stole my girl Isn't there anyone that likes you? How could you Date someone's girl? Hey, my friend You said you were my friend But turns out you're a terrible person You went and took Your own friend's girl You didn't think about your friend You did whatever you wanted With your sweet words You stole my girlfriend You stabbed me in the back How would I know? As if you were Arjuna But you're just a burglar You have no manners You lied to me My heart is hurt But I try to be okay My heart is hurt But I'm already miserable I would've never thought That you'd do this to your friend You said we were close friends You stole my girl Isn't there anyone that likes you? How could you Date someone's girl? What am I lacking? How could you do this? What did I do wrong? That you stabbed me like that? Should I ignore it? Pretending my heart accepts it? Feel the consequences of your actions That hurt me? You really are a damn jerk With a devil's brain Every day we were together But you stole my girl I can't keep it inside There's no way I can hold it Pretended in front of me But act like a damn jerk behind me My heart is hurt But I try to be okay CENSORED SINGLE COUNCIL OF INDONESIA Hey, that's enough! We don't need to show Doni's despicable actions here. From the beginning, we knew that his crotch area is messed up. He even stole his best friend's crush. Oh, my gosh, Don. Did you think of Olip's face? You're the one who wrote notes for Pulung Village. Yeah. It's there. Here's the data. There are 10 families here, and six families there. And then... - You go ahead. - Okay. Bye. Asri, wait. Please give me a moment, okay? While I still have the courage to talk to you. Okay? Fine. I understand that you made yourself busy with all sorts of activities. Your activism is for a good cause. I understand that. That's the reason you don't want to date, right? Okay, I understand. But... I came here... It's been three years, Asri. I've kept these feelings for three years. I like you, Asri. - I want us to get to know each other. - No, Olip. Sorry. - Asri. - Olip. No means no. No. I understand. But please, Asri, give me a reason. Go ask your friend, Doni. He tried me before. Commander! Damn you, Dutch! US Army? What are you doing in our war? And that day, one of my biggest fears happened. Our friendship was in danger because of love. Lip! - Get away. - Don't do this. - You know that he's wrong! - Hey! He's wrong! No need of explanation. - What's going on? - Don't get yourself involved, traitor. - You don't know! - No surprise. You were using us, right? Our friendship's ruined. Satisfied? Lip! Explain it to him clearly, Don. Bim, be quiet. Lip, what's going on? Hey, you don't know anything. Stay away! - He slept with Asri! - No! That's a lie! - That is a lie! - You're still trying to deny it. Who do you believe? Who do you believe? He said he didn't. Where did you hear that? Jonur? - From Asri! - What? - Asri said that to me! - No, that's a lie! Lip! - What're your saying? - Anything else? Defending him? Enough. - You're a traitor. - No. - What do you know? - I'm sure... A traitor helping a traitor. That's how it is. Out of the way. First, Lip, there has to be a perfectly good explanation for this. Second, Bim. Damn you. You keep calling me a traitor. - A traitor of what? - Traitor! What else would it be? - You're a traitor! - Why? Because I stole Lani? - You know that I like her! - Lani doesn't like you! - We're not sure! - "We're not sure"? - You're the one that... - Lip! - Don! - Let go of me! Satisfied? Our friendship is ruined. Are you satisfied now? I always thought you were my friend. You were not just my best friend. You were like a brother to me. Remember, this is not for Asri, this is because we were friends. Lip! Olip! Don. Don, is it true? - Did you sleep with Asri? - No. But I love Asri. How is that possible? Since when? - Whatever you like. - Me too. Okay? Asri? Asri! I... YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO EVERY GIRL DON!! Now I know what it feels like... You know how it feels for the girls that you slept with. Isn't it lame? Our friendship ruined because of girls. Maybe it is. Maybe it's not. Because we don't ask friends to build a household. Friends can't give us the happiness of marriage. But it's priceless. Sri, someone's looking for you. Why? I did it on purpose. People like Doni need to learn. Okay. Right. About Doni, I understand. Olip. As for Olip... maybe I was wrong. But what should I do? The world isn't fair. Why are you being this mean? Who do you think you are? What? Yes, I'm that mean. Do you know the consequences of what Doni did to me? My cousin... My cousin was broken because of him. The world doesn't need someone like Doni. And maybe the world doesn't need someone cowardly like Olip. We're used to being loved. We grow up being loved. WANT TO MEET UP? Until we grow up, we ask to be loved. But to love... IT'S BETTER WE STAY THIS WAY. Do we have experience in loving someone? I'M AFRAID WILL RUIN WHAT WE HAVE NOW. Ever since our childhood, what we know is only how to love so that we're loved. Is this wrong? You're blaming yourself for what happened to Bimo. - This is not wrong. - Right. If we think about it, this is not wrong. But my heart tells me, this is wrong. This is wrong. We're having an affair. Well, maybe this is karma for me. There is one more thing. There is one more thing I have to decide. Gus. I want you. You're the only one who accepts me for who I am. You want us to break up? May I know the reason? Because I can't keep doing what you want. I can't keep up with you. You're dramatic and overreactive. I have to listen to whatever you want. If you want to do something, I have to always listen to you. You changed everything. My eating habits, my clothes, the way I think. Soo you will change my whole lifestyle. Because that's the goal, Gus. You wanted to live a healthy life. Yes, I asked for a healthy life. I asked you to accompany me in my healthy life. You've been dictating me, Rita. Back then, my dad was sick. He'd been sick for a long time. It was so sad to see my dad in pain. And in the end, my dad died. I don't want anyone that I love to suffer like my dad. That's why... I want you to live healthily. Because you also want to live healthily. Sorry, Rita. I got dust in my eyes. And then? I know... I was wrong the last time we met. I'm sorry. But I accept all of your flaws. I accept all of your ugly parts. Your clumsiness, your smell. I accept you are dirty. Even about your past where your pants were lifted on the flag pole... - Enough. - ...I accepted you. Don't talk about that. Don't remind us about that. It's the past. We don't need to talk about it. And then? I also want you to accept my flaws. Thank you for reminding me. So that we can remind each other, Gus. But... if you still want to break up, I'm okay. Rita, why your house is so dusty? Oh, my gosh. You didn't sweep the floor, did you? When did you last swept? I swept it already, Gus. Liar. - Here, Rita. - And I realized I'm not as mature as them. - Do you want to come inside? - It's okay. How do we know someone is our soulmate? How did you know that A' Rahman was your soulmate? Agus. Nobody's perfect. Even if you're far below the average. I'm sad and I'm holding a knife. - Read the mood. - I don't want you to take it seriously. Like you're in a DPR session. Those who attend the meeting fell asleep. Relax. You'll realize that they are our soulmates later. When you start to feel that you can't hurt them and you feel that you can't take advantage of them. And all you want is for them to be a better person than they've ever been. And you both try to be the best partners. In my opinion... Rita is nice, Lani is also nice. But the question is, do you deserve any of them? Because people always want to get the best soulmate. But they don't realize whether they deserve them or not. Let's break up, Lan. Is it because I'm the person you're cheating with? Don't tell me that you want to fix your relationship with Rita. You don't want to fix anything with me? Is that it? I care about you. But I failed. When I'm cheating with you, I failed. It's not like you, Lani. I'm just pretending to respect you. Gus, you don't have to pretend. No. You don't have to. I understand. That's the reason I can't be with you. I can't continue this with you. If I leave Rita to be with you, one day, I'll leave you for another woman. That's what I'm afraid of. It's best... if we just stop here. Okay? I hate you. I hate you. I don't know when, but for now, I hate you.! At campus, I want you... to pretend we don't know each other. It hurts. Do you know that? Someone said that the bravest way to end a relationship is by letting someone who really loves you, hate you. And telling the truth even if you know that the result is bitter. I failed to make Lani and Rita happy. Now I can only pray that they'll meet someone they deserve. Even though that person is not going to be me. I hope your thesis defense goes smoothly, Agus. You're amazing getting your degree. - Go to the third floor. - Yes. - Thanks. - I'm going out. Do you want anything? - No, you don't have to. - Okay. - Good afternoon, miss. - Good afternoon. - Can I help you? - I have a meeting today. Right. What's your name? Bimo. Okay. Please wait a minute. Mr. Bimo from PT. Mandiri Sukes? Is that correct? Yes, that's right. They're waiting for you upstairs. - Thank you. - Okay, you're welcome. Help! Is anybody there? - Anyone outside? - Miss? - Help me! - Miss! - I can't open the door. - Miss. - Yes? - Stand back. Stand back? It's okay. You're safe now. Yes, sir! How are you, Don? I'm Agus. Lip. How are you? I sacrificed my friendship for the sake of love. Only to find out the fact that I don't deserve anyone's love. A wise man once said that time will heal those who I have hurt. And I hope time will make me mature to be deserving of loving and being loved. Welcome to the Dies Natalis of UNB! Let's have fun together, okay? As for my friends, time could heal the wounds in their hearts. But sweet memories will last forever. I'm waiting for the day when we can be together again. Thank you. I love you guys. Till we meet again. How is the event? Is it fun? - It's fun. - It's fun, isn't it? I made this event happen. Mass organization planned to raid this event. - Really? - Yeah. But because I know them, they aborted the plan. No wonder, I often give donations. Is there anyone of you who's ready to get married?
