What time is it? - Look for yourself. - [Murphy] Where's a clock? - Search me. When are the girls coming over? - [Murphy] Oh around 8 p.m. - Oh, think we'll get laid? - Tonight could be the night. (quacking) - What do you know about em? - Howie's sister and her friend. - Howie's sister? - Yeah. - I didn't know Howie had a sister. - Yeah. - Wait a minute, Howie's gross. What if his sister's a pig. - Hey man, with the lights out and a bag on her head... (chuckling) - Should I take a shower? - You might be getting a little funky. (flies buzzing) - I smell like beef. - Well, maybe one of these dolls wanna eat some hamburger. (laughing) - I could do some stuff. Wanna brewski? - Yeah, I'm just gonna be cleaning up around here. - [Taylor] Tell me more about the girls. - Well, Howie says he thinks Lynn's friend will go, you just have to push her easy. Her name's Marianna, something like that. - Who gets who? - I get Marianna. - What's wrong with Lynn? - Oh nothing, it's just I kinda like her as a person, it'd be hard to fuck her. - Yeah. Think Lynn will like me? - It's hard to say, man, you gotta wash up and try not to say gross things. Girls hate it when you talk gross. - I'm not that gross. - [Murphy] Oh the jury's still out on that one, man. You know, like those noises you make? Don't pull any of that shit. - Oh, what about the impersonations? - Oh I don't know, that Wolf Man sucks. - Don't start in on me again. - I'm just looking out for ya. Look, sometimes if you're funny a girl will fuck you. Impressions could maybe do it, if they're good enough. - But you don't understand. - But frankly, yours suck. - Thanks a lot, you really build up my confidence. - I'm just being honest. - Yeah, you tell me I stink. - Yeah you were the one that brought up your beefy smell. - You say no noises, no Wolf Man, be funny, and you get Marianna who's easy, I get Howie's sister Lynn who's probably some kind of virgin, what am I supposed to do? - Just be cool. Let me take the lead. Yeah, see I'll spread around a little wonder dust, be a little charming. You just be you, except cleaner and quieter. I'll do the work for both of us. (flies buzzing) - I'm taking a shower! - Who knows, maybe she'll be horny and you won't be such a terd ball, and you can get laid. - Yeah, thanks. - Doesn't stand a chance, poor suck head. He just doesn't understand, women hate desperate men. They can smell it. As soon as they sense you need it they back off. Best way to get laid is be rich, tall, married, have kids, and be pathetic. (shower running) Well at least Taylor is pathetic. (upbeat music) - Now tonight, right here on our show, we have a really big show. Topo Gigio and four wonderful mop heads from England, let's hear it for 'em. (clapping) But you don't understand I become a wolf when the moon is full. - That was the Wolf Man? - Right. - Where's Murphy? - [Marianna] I don't know. - I'll go see what's keeping him. Murph, are you back there? - What is he gone? - Are you all right, Murphy? - Maybe he's hurt. - No. (growling) (suspenseful music) (screaming) - Gah, what took ya? Thought I was gonna be staying in there all night. (breathing heavy) It's just a gag. (laughing) So let's go get some grub. - All right. - I got a headache. - Are you having your period? - No. - Whoo, thank God! (upbeat music) - [Woman] Where the hell have you been for the last two hours? - [Man] Well where I've been is I've been working, what do you think I'm doing? Do you think I'm out there like building a fucking castle for you! (muffled yelling) (clock ticking) - [Man] Ah, shut up, I want my dinner and I want it now. I worked my butt off (muffled yelling) - [Woman] I'm fat? You're so fat you can't even pick up your dirty socks. - [Man] Hey that's not my job that's your job, you pick it up. (muffled yelling) - [Woman] I hate you! - [Man] Oh fuck you! - [Woman] Oh fuck you! - I don't understand it. (rooster crowing) Look it wasn't your fault, it wasn't my fault, they were duds. And I mean for one thing it was nothing that we could have done, they were both having their periods. - Both? - Oh yeah. You get more than one woman in a place they all start having their periods, didn't you know that? - No. (scoffs) - You know I've been thinking. - Yeah. - Dayton, Ohio is a shitty town, man. I mean we're not duds we could score if we went someplace where the action was hotter. - You think so? - Yeah. I say let's pack up and move. - Move? - Yeah. You know I've been thinking. - Yeah. - Let's go to Hollywood, LA. We're young, we're strong, we can stand a really hard nightlife. - Yeah. - Look, we got no strings. They got bologna out there, they got newspapers, coffee. They got temporary jobs out there. - They do? - Hell yes, there's lots of temporary work in LA. - Well what'll you do? - You know, I always thought I should be in TV. - What? (laughing) - Come on, man, don't say it like that, I'm a funny guy. I get great ideas all the time. They need great ideas on TV. - Yeah, like that great Frankenstein monster gag. - That was just to break the ice, I didn't know you were gonna launch into the impressions. - I didn't know what else to do. - You had to do all of them? - Fuck you. - Well fuck you! - Fuck you! - Well fuck you! - Eat shit H man. - Dog dick. - What are you gonna do on TV, they took that iron butt show off the air years ago? - I don't know, Mr. Smart guy, but some kind of show where I can write and act and do comedy sketches like Carol Burnett. - (scoffs) One problem. - What? - You're no good. - So what? So the fuck what, man. I'm young I can afford to fail. What's it gonna do, ruin my career? I mean, what am I doing now? I work at a soda pop company, you think that's great, you think I like that job watching the bottles go by, watching the tours go through? Dayton isn't for me, I got stuffed. I wanna get out to LA and be somebody. Before they try to bottle me up. And we can score there. - Yeah. - Yeah, there's so much leg out there it just gobble you up. So I've decided, I'm goin. And I'd like for you to go with me. - Why? - Cause you're my pal. (flies buzzing) - Okay, what the fuck, I'm not getting any younger. - And the TV's great out there too, man, they got like a seven days a week 24 hours a day, a million stations. - Really? - It's great. - And there's lots of women? - Uh, nothin but wall to wall poon. After about a month out there, there'll be nothing left of you but an eight pound smile. (quacking) - And I'll be able to work on my impressions? - All over town. Oh, cause they got wax museums out there with dummy's of all the stars you doing. You'll be able to look at the dummies, talk to em in their own voices. Think how that'll shake 'em up. - Hiya, I never met a dog I didn't hate. - That's the stuff. Yeah, LA's got it all. Fast cars, fast women, fast food. Check it out.

Barry] And so it came to pass that Murphy Wegg and Taylor Dup left Dayton, Ohio, for Hollywood. Hello, I'm T. Barry Armstrong, the writer, director, and editor of this film. (flies buzzing) Thank you. You may recognize me from the alarm clock scene. Now this was an unfortunate glitch, but one which was unable to be removed from the final work print. Now the reason for this was money. By any standards this film was put together on a very low budget. The cost of raw film stock is a killer. In fact, it's so prohibitive that it's forced me into a shooting ratio of about one to one, and as anyone who's familiar with the art of filmmaking knows, this'll just about tie your hands in the editing room. But hey, I'm working so who's complaining? Now, let's talk about me and you, and magic. (snapping) I love film. Film allows you to go anywhere you wanna go. Have adventures you could probably never have. (snapping) Look out! (gun shots) See what I mean? It's a ticket, a passport, a passport to a gate of dreams or at least the dreams of a competent writer director. (sirens blaring) But like any passport it costs money, lots of money. In fact, if it had not been for the efforts of a very talented non-union cast working on spec, Two Idiots could not have been made. Or at best would have been a short subject. (sirens blaring) Now let me say a word about the art of film, film is one of the few art forms that deals with the past. Now we made Two Idiots well over a year ago and while you're sitting here seeing it now, all of us are on vacation or back at our regular jobs. Scary to think about. But not as scary as the future. I am currently putting together a proposal for Warner Brothers that I would like to share with you, the general public, without of course revealing too much of the plot, you can never be too careful. It's a 3D movie about a robot from outer space. (electronic music) I am absolutely convinced this will be a tremendous hit. Now if you've ever been interested in being a part of the film industry, I'd like to offer you a unique invitation. A chance to be on the bottom floor. For your financial contribution to this project or even any good ideas we can always use some of those, I'd be willing to offer you participation in the net profits of the European sales of this film. We also have brochures out at the snack bar of this theater explaining the legal ramifications of this arrangement. Hey, I'm ready to make history, are you? - Hi, my name is Todd Armstrong, I'm T. Barry's younger brother, um... - Now where were we? Oh yeah Murphy and Taylor are uh, with a landlord checking out an LA apartment. (sirens blaring) (upbeat music) - So uh, this is the living room. - Nice, nice. - Looks just like our other place. - Where you boys from? - Ohio, Dayton. - Ohio, great football town. - Oh yes, sir! - Buckeye state! (cheering) (laughing) So what do you boys do? - Well I'm in television, my friend Taylor here is a computer whiz, works the word processor machine. - Television huh? - Yeah, I'm a writer. - A writer, wonderful! See I watch TV. - Oh really? - Yeah, what show do you write for? - I write for the Bat Poon show. - What? - Public access. - Oh. But your friend here is a computer programmer. - That's right. - (chuckling) Well listen, boys. The rent's $550 a month, $300 damage deposit up front, but... there's no lease or painting fee, because as you can see the tenants that had this place before you turned it into a sty. - What's he talking about? - See I woulda cleaned and painted it myself but I have this ruptured disc in my back, I can't do any heavy work. Now no shit! Look! Look at this. (horror music) So I give you guys a break on the lease and you can clean it yourself. - Yeah. - Now, there's a lot of old people in the building so try to keep it down, huh? No loud TV's or stereos. - I got earplugs. - Good. You know what they say about these buildings don't you? - [Murphy] No. - They're only good for eating, sleeping, and screwing. - Well that's fine, we like that. (laughing) - I like you boys. You look responsible. I'll let you have it if you want it. I was young once, I know how hard it is to get started. (crunching) (screaming) My back, my back. - Brunella. Down boy. - Oh god, get me downstairs. - Okay I got him, you call a doctor. - No, no doctors! No more fucking doctors. Oh crap, fuck me my fucking back it hurts. - Your back? - Yes. (groaning) - What a sap. (upbeat music) - Fuck me. Oh, fuck me. (moaning) Oh fuck me. - How butch. - The chair, the chair quick. Quick. Strap me in I need a stretch. Make it tight. Now slip the strap over my head. Release the bag. - [Taylor] Uh need anything else? - Come back in about 30 minutes and undo me. I should be out of spasm then. - Right uh, I'll just turn on some music. (light orchestral music playing) - Wild, wild but, it's a wild world we live in, Howie. Yeah. No, no, don't worry about it. No, no way. The butt steaks left the phone switched on, yeah. Yeah, this ones on my bill. (laughing) Okay buh-bye. So how's Mr. Tattoo doing? - [Taylor] Oh he's all fucked up. Supposed to go back in a half hour and unhook him. It's awful. So, this is it. - [Murphy] Yeah. - What's next? - Today we watch Entertainment Tonight, tomorrow I hit the studios. - Great. I can go to a wax museum? - [Murphy] Hey they left beer in the fridge! - What idiots! - [Murphy] Want a brewski? - You bet.

I don't want macadamia nuts I want pecans. - Good morning guys. - Good morning Mr. Skink. - Good morning Mr. Skink. - What a stud.

We need good ideas for television. - Will you get me a soda pop? - Trash? - Second floor. - Thanks. - [Security Guard 1] She's a bitch. She says bring me a big top, honey. No, I don't want a big top, I want a space top she says. (security guard carries on in distinctively) Can you bring me a bar of soap? - [Perry] My name's Perry White, no fooling, just like Superman's balls. - Let's check this out. - I deal stud in a club in Gardena, but I think I should be on TV. You know what they say about me? I'm funnier than Mr. Ed. You know anything about poker? Poker, hell I married her. You hold her, I'll poke her. (laughing) - Oh. - You know anything about real estate? Tell me, is that a lot? (laughing) Maybe just a front yard. (snorting) (laughing) Well you can call me cocky because I grind so fine. Hey, did you hear about the ant on the commode? He got pissed off. (laughing) Hey, what did the elephant say to the naked man? Can you breathe out of that thing? (elephant blowing) Hose 'em down and give him a peanut. God it's great to be alive. - He'd be an okay guy if his jokes were better. - Huh, (laughs) You never know how you look til you get that picture took. - How do I look? - Like an apes buttocks. - Jesus. - Just sit back I'll fix you up. - Thank you, Higgens. You know what I think I need. I think I need a great big blood transfusion. Or a hot coffee enema, something like that. (chuckling) - [Ms.Higgins] Just close your eyes and relax. - [Dan] Relax. (laughing) Relax. - Think about what Reagan did to the world. - [Dan] Yeah. (drill whirring) Sometimes I wonder what we're doing to the quality of our lives. (drill whirring) Look at me, getting ulcers wondering what ideas for new television shows I'm gonna give the boys from New York. It's all just crap anyway. Oh, Higgens. We fill our lives with deceit, indolence, the lust for money, where did it all go wrong, where? (horror music) Oh sweet Jesus, please, please let me get a good idea for TV so I won't be fired. - Knock, knock. Hang on to this for me will you, doll, I haven't finished going through it yet. - That's trash. - Oh yeah, I love it when you talk dirty to me. (quacking) I come before you today because I get great ideas for television all the time, just like Carol Burnett to the ET. - Do you want me to call security? - No, no, Higgen, no it's fine, the man has some ideas. - Yes sir. - Well there goes trouble on a stick. Still all in all nice piece of horse flesh. - Yeah, well you were saying something about ideas Mr. Uh.. - Murphy. - Murphy. - Oh you got kind of a, woops. (laughing) - Humorous, funny. Well about your ideas-- - Hey, no way, Jack, you gotta pay this boy. - What? - I want $1,000 for any idea of mine you use. - $1,000 (laughing) candy from babies. Very well, $1,000 for any idea of yours we use. - Shake on it. Whoa, put that back in the bowel. - Back in the bowel, (laughing) that's good. - Okay, okay here it is. All right, now I want you to just look out, look straight out in front of ya okay? - Yeah, okay I'm looking. - Straight out in front. (laughing) - Would ya, holding ha! You're a funny man. - Okay, okay, here it is, here it is. Now you need to imagine 40 billion dollars. - Okay. - Got it? (heavenly music) - Got it. (alarm ringing) - It's four o'clock. It's time for the boys from New York scene. (laughing) - Anyway, I think you're gonna be very pleased at this daring approach, it's a brand new concept. - I don't know if the time is right for a new concept. - It's an old concept, it's just new for television. - Sounds innovating. - Let's have it. - Yes well, first I'd like you to meet the conceptualist of the project, Mr. Murphy Wegg, and our demographic dramaturgic script analyst, Carla Tokenaga Dortmonger. She's from Yale. - Oh, yeah, Yale's very nice. - Kids, come on in. Come in to meet these people. (laughing) Come on in, this is Morris Franklin from New York, Murphy Wegg. - How do you do, Mr. Wegg? - This is Carla Tokenaga Dortmonger. That's Wiler Weiner from New York. - Lookin hot. - There, Okay, Murphy. Go ahead and present your idea. - Uh, no, no, no. - No go ahead, Murphy, present-- - No, no, no. - I told you to present the idea. - First I want $1,000. - We haven't agreed to use the idea! - Hey, hey, I'm taking a meeting ain't I? I'm taking a meeting. (scoffing) $1,000 ce vous please. - Certainly. (laughing) Son of a bitch. - Yow. Great, almost made the rent. - All right, Mr. Wegg, anytime you're ready. - Okay, picture this 40 billion dollars. - Got it. - Got it. - Wait, cash or check? - [Murphy] Mean green. - Okay, got it. - Okay, that is how much money the video game industry will make in the next bloppity blop years. Trillions of people will drop the coin into the slot and watch... - Uh a TV screen. - Precisely. And watch... - Things chase each other and blow up. - Absolutely. - You're reading my mind. Paid TV, come on, let's fight back let's put paid TV on the network. You've played the video game, now watch the sexy comedy drama, the Pac-Man show. It's great, huh? Carla? (clearing throat) - This is the way the dramaturgic breakdown follows. Lights. (film rolling) Man on the run, living in fear, pursued by his ghosts. Speedy who is faster than he is. Shadow which follows him wherever he goes. Hokey, the slow terror of a wasted past and Bashful, the shy cutie yet deadly trap of over sentimentality. The object of the show is simple, man, the Pac-Man if you will, the hero, heroine or whatever, must have the wit and courage to confront his own fears. His own failings, his own ghosts if you will, and find sex. - [Everyone] Ah! - The stakes are high, his life. Lights! - Well.. I like it. - I say let's move it to pilot and see what happens. The initial outlay would be small. - But not at the expense of quality. - Oh, no. - No, no, no. - No, no. (whistling) (TV playing in background) - You were gone long enough. - Big day. So how was the wax museum? - Great, they have more than I expected. - Yeah? - But they got a bigger one in Beuna Park and I'm going there tomorrow. - Hmm. - So did you get a job on TV? - Yeah, made a 1,000 bucks today. - No shit! - Yup, I'm sitting on paper. - Great. - Sign contracts tomorrow for about 50 grand. - Great. - Yeah, Monday they start casting the Pac-Man show. - Anything in it for me? - Ain't it the truth. Ain't it the truth, they just come out of the fucking woodwork, what can you do? You can't even get laid! Can you act? Can you act? You know what they were talking about, they were talking about casting William Shatner in the part. - No shit. - And you wanna be in the show? (laughing) Please, (laughing) my heart. - Okay, okay, hit me over the head with a brick bat why don't ya? I won't be in your stupid show. - I'm sorry, maybe you can be a waiter or something. - Fuck you. - Okay, just trying to be nice to you for old times sake. - Each shit H man. - Turkey neck. - Oh fuck! - What? - I forgot to unstrap the landlord yesterday. - Moron, I told you not to help people. - Oh God. - He's got an attraction attraction by now. - What should I do? - Well he's probably dead. You gotta just wait, see if it starts to stink down there and then call the cops. - What if he's not dead? - Man, do what your heart tells you. (TV program playing in a foreign language) (upbeat music) - Well, that was tasty. - Excellent. - What do you call that again? - We call it an enchilada. - [Everyone] Enchilada. - Well it was excellent. - And the green stuff was... - Guacamole. - [Everyone] Guacamole. - Don't go too far away Ms. Higgens, I may need you later to take my dic... Tation. - So you think this Joe Clark might be our man, huh? I've never heard of him. - Well, he's an experienced actor and taking the high concept approach, he's a got a fresh and unknown face. He'll work for scale. - He also looks a lot like the Pac-Man. - Yes, but does he know the apple pattern? - And who else do we have? - Yes, R. Taylor Curtis. - Ah from a Star Hunt, very impressive. - Bring in Joe Clark. - Let's grill this poon hound. (clock ticking) - So you think you could get behind the project, the character? - Oh yes, particularly the restaurant scenes. Who is the director? - We were thinking of Winn Kaalsen, he's the Swedish director. - No, I don't know him. - He directed that series of Dad's Root beer commercials. - Oh yes! They were very funny. - Well yes, but what impressed us most was his pacing. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - Yes. - Yes, yes he got a lot in in 30 seconds. - Mm-hmm. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Any questions Wiler, Morris? Murphy? - How big is your dick? - What? - Like this, does it go up here?

Very taint. But then we cut off here. I know, props, pillow, little pillow. Yeah. Now put this pillow on your belly, keep the table from being to hard, yeah. - Howdy! Hold it, hold everything. This is my favorite scene. - Okay, hold it everybody, gentlemen take it over. Have a seat boys. The scene is very good. (laughing) Okay. Start. - [Sandra] Do you come here often? - [Joe] Not often enough, the food here is very good. - [Sandra] You're an interesting man, you seem so lonely, so energetic. But men like you scare me. - Don't get too close, bad things happen to those who get too close to me. - You should get a bigger table. - Hold it. What? What? - Table needs to be bigger, she get too close to him. - No, but the shot is a tight shot. I want tension with the position. - Okay, I'm tense already. Look at me, I'm shaking. Look, I don't want any artsy fartsy answers, I write for the people. And why is that pillow under her shirt? Who knocked her up? Pac-Man, that's not in my script. Why do you fight me on these points? And where are the waiters? There have to be waiters! - Please, I am director, this only rehearsal waiters be here tomorrow. - Well I want them here now or I'll have your ears you swarthy swage. - Gentlemen, please. - Look, I'm sorry, it's just I've been sweating blood over this script and I want it done my way not the Swedish version. - Idiot! - Meatball! - Fuck you! - Fuck you! - Let's just run the scene. - That's fine with me, but I don't see how you're gonna do it with waiters. - Well use your mind will you, stupid, stupid man. There are four waiters. We'll have a waiter over here. And one waiter over here with bottle of Pouli vishay. - If you say so Hortence. - Head waiter is preparing nice big steak and spinach salad. - I'll have mine medium rare. - And uh... - Where's Pokey? - I'm getting to that if you just give me the courtesy of hearing me out. - Sorry, didn't mean to tread on tender toes. - The fourth waiter, Pokey, is over here with dessert cart. - Sounds delicious, Winn, sounds good. - Thank you, now may we continue? - Bon ami Winnie da pooch. - Such a stupid man, how did he write such a marvelous script? I don't... Continue my fine actors. - Could you give me the cue please? - Oh sorry. - Uh, I think I can, but men like you scare me. - [Joe] Don't get too close, bad things happen to those who get too close to me. - [Sandra] Like what? - [Joe] Like they get devoured. - [Sandra] Sounds good. (laughing) - I need a drink. Waiter, some water. - Okay, let's see you get through this with no waiter. - Oh shut up, we pretend. Okay. Waiter comes, you smile. He fills your glass Pac-Man, then you, Sandra, continue. - [Joe] New York tap water, best in the country. - You clink glasses and then you spill the water on her t-shirt. - Oh my god I'm so sorry. - Oh dear. An accident. - I'm so embarrassed. Now when...this is where I try to dry her off? - Yeah, yeah. - I'm so embarrassed. - Uh, uh. I'm all wet. - Oh, what a scene. - I'm sorry I'm so clumsy. Perhaps after I eat we could go back to my place for some dry things. - What writing! - Or to my place because that's where I keep my clothes. - [Joe] Sounds good, but first I have to eat. - I understand. - I haven't eaten for days. - I've been pursued. - By whom? - My past, wasted youth, faulty sentimentality. - You're so virile. So agile. - Powerful stuff. - Okay, now without the waiters... - My favorite part, go! Go! - [Sandra] Go, go, I need you Pac-Man. - Go for the cherry man, the cherry. - Go, go, I love you, I want you. The waters are filled with sharks Pac-Man. - Go that way, go that way. - Go, go. - Now run, run, run! - Go, Go, - [Men] 200, 400, 800, 1600. - Now, you're full of fish, you're full of fish. (electronic game music) (screaming) - Cut, cut. (everyone clapping) - Beautiful, beautiful scene. - Not bad, not bad at all. - What did you think? Was it okay without the waiters? - Oh yeah, yeah, it's fine. - I don't know it feels, with the wall of fish it feels funny to me. - Yeah, yeah, it will for now, for a bit. - Just keep it up, looks great! Trust me. Yeah take 10. - [Camera Woman] Take 10. - [Winn] So what you think? - Looking hot. - Yeah, yeah, you see we start in tight the table and pull back for my shot of chase. - Sounds like genius to me. Maybe I spoke too soon, Bjorn. - No, no we get on fine, you see. - The scene looks great you weasel, I love the work you're doing. - Well, you've given me the first script I've seen that's actor proof. - Oh too kind. Way too kind, mon amie. Hey um, do we need another waiter in the background? I've a got a buddy who'd be a good waiter. - Does he have experience? - Oh boy, you ask the toughies. Uh, none. He does impressions. - Sorry then, no we only want the best. - I see. Well he's pretty shitty. - Well then uh... No we don't want him. - Okay. - Yeah. - Okay Dup, we're gonna start all over again. You're forcing my hand. You know I don't wanna open that door. But I guess you give me no choice. And you know the horrible thing about doors, once they've been opened it's real hard to keep what's on the other side out. - What do you mean? (chuckling) (door opening) (suspenseful music) (making silly noises) - You see my friend here, Sergeant Rose? - Yeah. - Well my friend don't like you Dup. I like you okay, but my friend don't. What can I tell ya, he's a product of a nuclear family, middle child, ex-catholic, he's dangerous. As long as you talk to me and tell me the truth, I'm gonna stay here and keep my partner in line, but if you clam up or you keep lying to me, well I might have to get myself a bottle of mineral water. And then.. - Then I get me some meatballs. Then I get some taters, mm. Then I get me some gravy. - Okay, okay, go easy just keep him away! - I want my dinner, chomp, chomp. - Okay, Rosey, okay. Okay quiet, quiet Rosey. Quiet, (chuckling) it's okay, I think Taylor's gonna cooperate with us now, Rosey. (snorting) (squealing like a pig) Okay Taylor, you don't mind if I call you Taylor do ya? - No. - Okay, Taylor, you put the strap around his neck right? - Yeah, I strapped him into the chair and there were straps around his arms, legs, and his neck, but he told me to do it. - He told you to do it, he told you! - Yeah, yeah. - I'm getting hungry. - He told you? - He told me to do it. - What about the bag of sand? - Around his neck and over the doorway, but he told me to do it. - You're lying! - Calm, calm, calm Rosey, calm Rosey. Hey, wait a minute. (laughing) Maybe they're just gay. (laughing) So you guys were making love gay style. - What? - Got a little carried away, a little rough trade. You think I don't know? I've been to those movies, I've read those books, I've been to those bars. - You have? - [Taylor] No, no you got me wrong. His back was out, he wanted traction. - Oh, and you gave it to him! - Gave it to him! - As your court appointed attorney, I would advise a plea of guilty. The DA has assured me that he'll reduce the charges to second degree murder. - Well that sounds pretty bad. - Well, it's not good news, but it's better than the gas chamber. - Yeah, I don't wanna go to the gas chamber. - No, no of course you don't. Why you'd be a fool if you did. We could try for a plea of insanity, that would get you back on the street but uh... Then again, I think you'd be better off behind bars. - No, I don't wanna go to jail. - Hey, hey, not so fast. It's just like being in the army. - I hate the army. - Or living in the same apartment for 20 or 30 years, with basically the same neighbors. (bell ringing) (dramatic music) - Are you on my side? - Of course I am. Listen, some people blossom in prison. Why you could do arts and crafts, weight lifting, a lot of things. - Well I wouldn't mind getting into some weight lifting. - There you see! And you'll meet a lot of new men... And women. - Women? - Oh sure. Well you go for outings with the female prison. - Female prison! And the DA will drop all the charges? - Reduce 'em, yeah. - Where do I sign? - Right here. (laughing) - What is it? - Well, Joe, we've been working on this project for about a week now-- - It's really been something. - Joe, you are awfully good as the Pac-Man I mean you got the part down. - Well thanks, I've spent about $50 in quarters researching the roll. (laughing) - I love that. (laughing) That's too much. You actors. (laughing) But I'm gonna have to fire you. - What? - It's not you, it's the concept. You see, when we cast you in this part we were aiming at a high concept, but the life that you gave the script was so, well how would you say uh, energetic. Boys from New York decided we could really clean up with this show. Aim for a larger share. What I'm saying is we've decided to go for low concept and even as we speak, William Shatner is reading the script. - What? - The Captain himself. - You're firing me for William Shatner? - If Billy wants the part, yes. - But can he do the waiter scene? Can he run that fast? Can he work with fish? - Well we got a stunt double. - Well I think this sucks! What about Sandra? - We're keeping Sandra, she's got great tits, and I think I can fuck her. - (scoffs) Ah this really sucks. You used me, you used me. - Well yeah, but we didn't use all of ya. Think about it this way. - [Camera Women] Marker. - Eat shit. - Now I'd like to say a word about the importance of continuity of the-- - That's the logical progression of action in sequence. - The importance of continuity in the art of film, the fabulous director, Inglemar Bergman once said "You've gotta have it." Well unfortunately in this film, we don't. We used to have it, but we lost it about, what four weeks? - Four weeks. - Four weeks ago. And it really wasn't our fault, several crucial scenes had to be um.. - They tried to sue him. - Todd. Several crucial scenes-- - Sorry. - No, no several crucial hard hitting scenes about the legal profession and life in this country as we know it had to be excised from the final answer print. - They really screwed us up. - Lawyers are such horrible, horrible people. At any rate, contributors to the robot from outer space, should not be worried in the least because that project is gonna have plenty of continuity. - You bet, tons of it. - I'm sorry, but enough is enough. That was one of the long expository scenes from the new film "Two Idiots in Hollywood", film which I frankly didn't like very much. T. Barry Armstrong has demonstrated, I think, once and for all Loupenis, why it's so difficult being a film critic. A really terrible movie like this, is a hard sit. - Now see now, I really didn't find it so terrible. Despite lack of momentum or any real characters you could identify with, I found it curiously moving. Even though it is definitely one of those films if you're running late and can't find a place to park near the theater, or want some popcorn, or cold drink, or need to go to the restroom first, I mean I say go don't sit there and hold it in. - Well yeah, right. Let's talk about momentum. Those pauses, obviously to punctuate on a non-existent tension in a non-existent film. Here are some clips of the pauses from "Two Idiots in Hollywood", by T. Barry Armstrong. (cinematic music) Talk about I got plenty of nothing. - Well yeah, at the same time I felt the film took a hard and a long look at the entertainment industry. And the filmmakers continually aiming to appeal to the lowest common denominator, we may soon find ourselves viewing a film which is lower and more common than anything we could have ever imagined when we were children. And our parents dropped us off unchaperoned at the picture show for hours at a time, and we had to search for meaningless flickering images to fill our empty little lives. One of the bright lights in the film is an awkward lens setted clip of T. Barry Armstrong's new film "The Robot From Outer Space". In which Robert I must confess it's so good it gave me goose pimples. - Wrong as usual, Loupenis. Using one film to promote a sequel or in this case another film, is a dangerous Hollywood trend. It makes about as much sense as putting on your rubbers before the date. (chuckling) - The last time you touched your rubbers was when it rained. - Oh fuck you. - Fuck you! - Fuck you! - Fuck you! - Fuck you! - Fuck you! - Fuck you! - Well I hated this movie. But I'm sorry this whole discussion has degenerated into-- - [Girl] Mr. Wegg? - Oh, the voice of some editors. - Mr. Wegg, there's a message from your office. - Well if it's from the oriface, (laughing) you know, you really are lovely my dear. - Thank you, sir. - I don't know, the dove like breasts, the creamy thighs, the taunt buttocks. - Thank you, sir. - Have you ever thought about making acting a career? - Only in my dreams. - Oh dreams, dreams. Well perhaps I could make those dreams come true. (quacking) - What sir? - If you have talent. Now, do you have talent? - Oh yes, sir. - Are you willing to work hard? - Yes, sir. - Break down all emotional and psychological boundaries even to the point of performing acts, which may at first seem physically repugnant? - If necessary. - Do you have a headshot? - No. - That's all right. I can see your head. (laughing) I know, I'll tell you what. Why don't you read me my message and that way I can check your diction. - Yes, Mr. Wegg. - Okay now, let me see if I can find your diaphragm all right, just gonna look for the diaphragm, let's see. Oh, there it is. Okay, now breathe. (breathing deeply) Good, good, good. Okay, now my message. - Oh Murphy, it's Taylor, I'm in jail for murdering the landlord. Signed the confession, trial tomorrow. Could be a mistake but I told lawyer to put me in prison, need help. - Good, but yeah I don't know, somehow I didn't really believe that you needed help. - Oh but I do. - I don't know, maybe with some rehearsal, tonight at my apartment. - Well if you think it's necessary. - Oh it's absolutely necessary. - Hey, Wegg, Weiner and Davis wanna see you, better hurry it's important. - Oh great, it's the boys from New York, see you at eight my dear. - Oh, where? - My place. No wait, second thought, let's make it the Chateau moi moi. No wait, third thought, let's make it my place, it looks like Taylor will be out of the apartment for awhile. So what does Billy say, yes, no, maybe? What? You brute, you kill me with suspense. - Ah, shut up! - You're fired. - Uh, what? - We're hiring someone else to do the rewrites. Shatner may do it, but he wants rewrites. - Oh wait, wait, my script? No that's impossible, it's actor proof. - Oh your script is good, - Script is good, but Mel and I agree you can't do the rewrite. You're too stupid. - You're too stupid. - That's my genius. Okay, okay, okay, who are you hiring? - Jerzy Kosinki. - [Murphy] Well he's foreign, who the fuck is he? - He was in Reds. - Clean out your desk, you're finished. - But don't worry, maybe we'll work together again on some future project. (crying) - You can't do this to me, you can't, you mean, you horrible horrible people. You write by committee. (laughing) What a terrible horrible day, I mean here I was I was about to be King pin. (laughing) Money, fame, pussy, a track record and then smash. (laughing) All my hopes are dashed, there is no hope. None!

(upbeat rock music) (clanging) (car honking) - Do you think we'll be here long? - No, very short, very short. - Why would you say that? - He's obviously guilty as hell. - Mr. Dup, do you promise to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the United States of America? - I do. - I must say, in all my years as a judge, having heard thousands of cases from the bench, this particular case turns my stomach. I think I may just vomit. - I object. You're influencing the jury. - Overruled. - C'est la vie. (upbeat music) - Oh wow. - Yeah. - So Mr. Dup. Is it true you had a relationship with the dead landlord Joc Jeremy? - I just met him. - Oh I see, so you didn't even know him very well? - No. - I see, it was all very casual. - I just met him. - I see, I see. - So you picked him up in your arms, carried him down to his room, - Yes. - You strapped him in a chair. - Yes. - And then you hung a 30 pound weight around his neck. - I'm gagging. - Yes. - And then what did you do? - Uh, I went upstairs and I watched TV. - You what? TV? - Yes. (everyone gasping) - After a vicious homosexual torture murder! Your honor, I've heard enough! - No, you got me wrong, I was helping him. - Order. Order, or I'll clear this chamber.

(laughing) - Judge, your honor, wait. I've lived in this great country, America, for 62 years to be exact. (soft tune humming) Speaking for the rest of the jury, there's no need to deliberate. We've talked all through the trial, and we are agreed. - Well good, let's hear it. - We find the defendant, Taylor Dup-- - Wait! Hold the phone, hold up. Don't gas him. I got evidence. - [Everyone] Evidence? - Murph! - Hey kid, don't worry I'm batting for ya. - [Judge] Take the stand. - Thanks judge. - Questions? - Thanks, sire. (jury cheering) So, is it true that you know the defendant Taylor Dup? - Yes. - [Everyone] Ooh. - Will you tell us what happened on the afternoon when landlord Joc Jeremy was cruelly murdered? - Okay here it is. Taylor here carried him downstairs. - [Everyone] Yes. - Strapped him into his chair. - [Everyone] Yes. - Hung a 30 pound sand bag from his head. (everyone gasping) - Order, or I'll clear this chamber. - Anything else? - Yes. He went upstairs and he watched TV. - No! - Order, order! I heard enough, hippy's, yippy's, and beatnicks, and now this. It's people like you who make a sham out of civilization and turn the me generation into a cruel joke. Jury, what have you to say? - We agree, we find the defendant, Taylor Dup-- - Stop! Stop! - A ghost!

(screaming) ET, ET, ET, ET, ET, ET. - No I'm not the ET. (everyone groaning) But I am a ghost. I am the spirit of Joc Jeremy the landlord. - Holy smokes! - This man has done nothing. He tried to help me. - Well then we should let him go. Agreed? - [Jury] Yes. - Wait! You don't think I come all the way back from the dead to untangle your messes. Huh! It's too much trouble. You all act like dogs. So eager to get a big dinner. Just remember, it's only bones. The real feast is in the air. In the water, in the trees. Live like Adam and the garden will be yours. There are places in the world for everyone. Unfortunately most of them are at the back of the line. Remember, those that can, do those that can't move to California. What's the matter with you?

Smelling mimosa, drinking ice water, thinking how high the table tops were. (upbeat music) - Well I guess that landlord turned out to be a pretty okay guy after all. - Yeah, considering. - Yeah. - Thanks for coming, I know you were probably pretty busy. - Nah, the butt steaks fired me. - No! - Yeah. - What about Pac-Man? - They stole the idea. - Gee, well it doesn't matter. - No. - Nah. - Why? - You never had rights in the first place. - Hey that's right. - They'll be sued. - Ah, it serves 'em right. - So. - So. - Did you get laid? - I got that close. What about you? - Hardy har har. - Hey come on man, don't get discouraged. LA is a land of opportunity. - Yeah? - Sure. You know, I've been thinking. - Yeah. - Let's become DJ's. - What? - We'd get tons of snatch. - You think so? - Oh yeah, we can talk. - Yeah. - We like music. - Yeah. - We don't have to live like dogs. - We don't? - No, we can have it all. - What if we can't? - We can still dream.
