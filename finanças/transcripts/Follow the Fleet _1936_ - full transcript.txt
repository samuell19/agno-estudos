Say, will you guys let me forget I was once a hoofer? Boy, it sure seems swell to be getting back where the women talk your own language. You bet, it's going to be great to be able to talk to a dame without using your hands. Hey, you've been holding out on me. I didn't know you had a girl in your act. - Give me that. - Wait a minute. So that's why you joined the Navy. You thought a torpedo would be easier to dodge than a shotgun. Don't be funny. - I asked that little girl to marry me. - What? - Yeah, she turned me down. - Imagine a guy asking a dame to marry. Say, what's become of her? Oh, I heard from her when we were down in Manila. She's working here in Frisco. Well, maybe she's got a friend, let's go see her. No, we're all washed up. Say, give me that picture, will you? What do you want it for? I thought you said you were all washed up. Oh, I just kept it because I came out so good.

Boy, I hope I pick something good this time, I'm always getting schoolteachers. Why not? You got a lot to learn yet. I want something with spangles on it, like that ex-partner of yours. Say, let's find her. No, she probably wouldn't even speak to me anymore. The last letter I had from her, she said she was working... in a high-class night spot where all the money goes. Yeah? Well, that's the way it is. Listen you mugs, don't forget that liberty expires at 12 o'clock, we've got our orders. You needn't wait up tonight mother, we're going to Paradise.. Six admissions, please. - You want any dance tickets? - Dance tickets? - How much are they? - Three for 25. Give me one. - One? - Yeah, see if I like it. Oh, what's the matter? Don't your friends dance? They're underage, I hold them on my lap. Hey Bake, where's Bilge? Stopped off to buy the beer, he knows a place where you get 3 cents back on the bottles. Hi, tiny. I'll see you fellows out the stream, I got to look up a party in the telephone book. Hello? Information? Look, I want to get the number of a Miss Sherry Martin, she lives at 610 Hyde Street. Yeah, all right. Sorry miss, it's the rule of the Paradise. No girls are allowed in without escorts. OH I see, Women aren't even admitted to paradise without a man, Eh? Yeah. Oh, there you are. Don't bother, your hands are full. I'll get the tickets for the two of us. Two, please. I'll explain to you when we get inside. Did you bring your lunch too? Thank you, you see, I wanted to get in to see my sister. She works here and they wouldn't let me in without an escort. Oh, ought to admit I thought you were trying to frame me. Oh no, you see, I've never been here before. My sister often asked me to come down, I've never been able to. I've always been so busy but, well, tonight I just felt like a little spree. Well, I hope you find it. I, I've sort of been playing hooky all day today. I spent the entire afternoon watching the fleet come in. Oh gee, it was exciting, if I were a man, I'd be a sailor. Yeah, I know just how you feel. They're pretty, aren't they? But I'll bet you're used to seeing pretty girls all over the world. I never give them a tumble sister, women don't interest me. I'll bet you dance beautifully. No, not a step. Well, I got to be shoving off, so long. - Come to Papa. - You sure work fast, Bilge. Where did you pick up that awful-looking crow? - But she picked me up, I think she's screwy. - She must be if she tried to pick you up. - Well, what you have? - Six clean glasses. - Who is it? - Connie. Oh Connie, come in. I'm glad to see you, how you get away? What about your music lessons? Oh, I didn't feel like giving them, I just called up and said I was ill. I guess it's just a touch of spring fever. This is a funny time to be having spring fever, in October. Things usually happen to me out of season. Connie, why don't you admit it, you're lonesome. Some men aren't half bad. I don't know why. I just seem to frighten them away. You look too darned intelligent. You know, it isn't that gentlemen really prefer blonds, it's just that we look dumber. Maybe that's it. It used to end up by my saying I'd be a sister to them. Now it begins by their saying they'll be a brother to me. That's the difference between us, I make them say uncle. Well, I can understand that, you're attractive. Connie, women weren't born with silk stockings on, you know. Well, I wear silk stockings. And no one looks at them. Well, men haven't X-ray eyes. Though sometimes I wonder. - Gee, you must look lovely in this. - And so could you, if you wanted to. Things have got to be dolled up nowadays. That's why they put brass on battleships. Why don't you let me try to fix you up? You'll be amazed how much better it'll make you feel. Even though I'm not a blond, I could be dumb, couldn't I? And you'll probably do all right too. Takes a lot of brains to be dumb, let's try it. Hey, Kitty. Connie, this is Kitty Collins. Kitty Collins, this is my sister. - How do you do? - Hi you. Will you fix her up? Well, I'll do what I can Sherry. Oh, oh, I got to go on. I'll be back after the number and remember the old saying, clothes make the man. Do you have to wear these? Oh no, I just wear them to impress my pupils. I'll bet they're impressed. - Nobody ever take you for Sherry's sister. - I guess not.

Well, what a surprise seeing you here. Yeah, I'm kind of surprised to see you here too. - Gosh, I'm glad to see you. - I'm glad to see you too. Say, you better do something for that cold. Oh, this isn't a cold, it's tears because I'm so glad to see you. I'm glad to see you too. Thanks, I've missed you Bake. Oh, I've missed you too, a little bit. - Gosh, I'm glad to see you. - Same here. I worried about you for two years until I learned you'd joined the Navy. Didn't you ever get my letter? Oh sure, I heard from you, all right. Telling me about how well you were doing and everything. Why didn't you write to me? I didn't think you cared about hearing from me. Especially after that last time we saw each other. Well, all I said was I didn't want to marry you. Yeah, I know. It all seemed very important at that time. But it doesn't make any difference now. Doesn't it? No, as you said, marriage would've ruined your career. - Well, I found out that I was wrong. - No, maybe you're right. If you would married me, you wouldn't be working in a chop-suey joint like this. Oh, I don't see any admiral's stripes on you. I like to go incognito, just to mingle with the boys. Order, please. Oh, I want a Coke and... Miss Martin will have a chocolate sundae without whipped cream. With whipped cream and plenty of it. Gosh, you're glad to see me. Well, you sure look different. Don't I? I'm beginning to feel different. Kitty, there's a sailor I want to meet, how do I go about it? Are you kidding? - No, I mean, are there any rules? - Well, yes and no. Yes before you meet him and no after. Gosh Sherry, how you ever get in a place like this? Well, it seems I didn't mean much after we split up. For some reason, they're not interested in a girl dancing alone, less she's got a fan. A fan doesn't cost much. Gee, it's swell being with you again, friends? - Friends. - Let's kiss and make up. No, let's just make up. That'll give you something to work for. Why don't you guys take a walk. Hi you, baby. Hello sailor. - So you know my name. - Sure. - Haven't we met before? - That's what I should've said. No, but haven't we? Not a chance, think I could forget a face like yours? Oh, I must've been mistaken. We're meeting now, want to dance? Oh, I was under the impression that you didn't dance. Who, me? I'm the heavyweight dance champ of the fleet. You've got me up against the ropes here. - Maybe we better sit this one out. - Sure. This is a lucky night for me baby, you're just my type of girl. Oh really? I would thought you were the kind of man who never gives girls a tumble. You got some very funny ideas about me. Oh, I admit I've been around but I've never met one like you baby. No, I guess you haven't. - Hey, what's the idea? - It's a line of defense. Well, watch my maneuvers. You can't beat the Navy. - All right sailor. I surrender. - Unconditionally? - Well, I'm willing to discuss terms. - Ok baby, let's get out of here. Let's find someplace where we can talk. I'll go ransom my hat and meet you at the back exit and don't walk out on me. ♪ Get thee behind me, Satan ♪ ♪ I want to resist ♪ ♪ But the moon is low and I can't say no ♪ ♪ Get thee behind me ♪ ♪ Get thee behind me, Satan ♪ ♪ I mustn't be kissed ♪ ♪ But the moon is low and I may let go ♪ ♪ Get thee behind me ♪ ♪ Someone I'm mad about is waiting in the night for me ♪ ♪ Someone that I mustn't see, Satan, get thee behind me ♪ ♪ He promised to wait but I won't appear ♪ ♪ And he may come here, Satan, he's at my gate ♪ ♪ Get thee behind me ♪ ♪ Stay where you are, it's too late ♪ Where's Connie?

And now as you know... the Paradise Club holds its popular Saturday night dance contest. Our manager Mr. Weber will tap the shoulders of the eliminated couples... and as usual, your applause will decide the winners. I thank you. - Kind of neat, eh? - Kind of. Listen, my enlistment is up in the spring. Then we'll pick up where we left off, only this time you'll ask me to marry you. The Navy must be a wonderful institution, produces such a modest, shrinking type of man. Yeah, doesn't it? Go away. How do you like that? On my dime, he wants to cut in. Village cutups. - Wait a minute, this is the dance contest. - Is it? - I'm not supposed to be in it. - Why not? - Because it's for guests. - Well, I'm a guest, ten cents' worth. No, I don't think I'd better. Maybe you're right, you'd probably couldn't keep up with me anymore anyway. Oh, you think not? I'm not so sure you could keep up with me. Gosh, kind of taken the wind out of my sails. There aren't any sails these days baby, just steam, full steam ahead. Come on, let me get you something to eat. - Don't tell me you can cook too. - Oh yes. You don't know the kind of person I really am. Well, you've given me a faint idea. Oh boy. Say, I haven't seen the inside of an icebox since I left home. - Where is your home? - Texas. I've been back once or twice to see my mother but... - She never knows when I'm going to turn up. - Don't you ever write her? I'm no good at writing, don't know what to say. - You could say you love her. - What's the use? She knows that. Custard pie. - Now, don't tell me you made this too. - Yes, I made it. Sweetheart, you've got everything and I knew it from the first minute I saw you. - Bilge, I've got to tell you the truth. - About what? Well, the first time you saw me, you acted as my escort. You remember the funny looking girl with the glasses who bought you ticket? - Yeah. - Well, that was me. - Well, what was the getup for? - Oh, it wasn't a getup. Until tonight those were the kind of clothes I wore, that was the real me. Well, how do you like that? But that doesn't make any difference, I'm nuts about you anyway. - Say Connie, what are you? - A teacher. I knew it. - Yes, a music teacher. - Oh well, that ain't so bad. Oh Miss Martin, I want to speak to you. Oh Mr. Weber, I want you to meet Mr. Baker, a friend of mine. Mr. Baker is a guest. - Oh, how do you do? - How are you? - Mr. Weber owns the Paradise Club. - Oh, that's so? Not a bad little spot you got here Mr. Weber. It isn't quite right for Miss Martin though, she's used to working in a nicer atmosphere. Oh, you don't like this atmosphere. Oh, it's all right for some people but not for Miss Martin. - And who are you? - Me? I'm her manager. I see. Well, I think you'd better go manage her somewhere else. Beginning right now. Pick up your salary in the morning Miss Martin, good night.. - Well, I fixed that. - You fixed me. I did that on purpose. I don't want you working in a place like this. And tomorrow I'll take you over to see Jim Nolan, I'll get him to put you in his show. He'll do that for me. It might've been better to wait until we were sure. - Now, I'll take care of everything. - That's exactly what's worrying me. Oh Bilge, how long you going to be here? We're having war games, we don't know when we have to show up. - Maybe in a week, maybe tonight. - Oh no. Now don't you worry, we'll be back in the spring. On the night the fleet arrives you and me have got a date. - Honest? - The minute we hit port. Pretty soon after that, I'm out of the Navy for good. Oh really? What you think to do then? - Going to stick to the sea. - Oh, I love the sea too. My father was a sea captain. You know, that's what I want to be. I'm taking my chief petty officer exams now. Then I'm going to try for my master's papers in hopes that I can get a ship. Bilge, I got a ship. - What? - Yes, come here. Here it is. It's a model of the real one, was my dad's ship. He died of a broken heart when she ran aground off the north coast. I wouldn't want my ship to run aground either. Dad left my sister Sherry what little money he had. And he left me the ship because he knew how much she meant to me. Boy, she's a beauty. You know, I've always had dreams of sailing on her again as I did when I was a kid. A steam schooner, just the kind I like to feel under me. Baby, I'd like to be captain of your ship. I want to sail under my own steam to China, India and all those spigot ports. Oh, so do I. I've always wanted to sail on her to all those spigot places with my husband at the helm. - Holy cat. - What's the matter? I got to be going, got to be back on board by 12 o'clock. - Oh gee. - Sorry. Well... - Hello Connie, Sherry home? - Not yet, she's a little later than usual. What's happened to you Connie? You look swell. May I present Mr. Smith, a friend of my sister's Mrs. Manning. - How do you do? - How do you do? - I, I'm sorry to broken in like this. - Oh no, that's all right, don't go. Smith was just leaving, he has to be back on ship by 12. I can't stay, I have an engagement, but tell Sherry I dropped in. Good nigh dear. - Good night Mr. Smith. - Good night. I wish you didn't have to leave Bilge but maybe you'd better. Yeah, I guess so. If you're still here tomorrow night, will I see you? Will you. - Tell the admiral not to go away. - I'll do that, good night baby. - Bonsoir. - Good night. - Mr. Smith. - Oh, hello. I'm going that way anyway, so I thought I might drop you off at the dock. Thanks, that will help me out a lot. I'll be up to get you the first thing in the morning and we'll go see Nolan together. - Here. - Thanks. Can't you come up for a little while? Oh, I'm sorry Sherry, only got a minute. I got to be back on board by 12 o'clock. Good night. Good night. Good night. Haven't you got a home? Turn in all liberty card, all liberty is been canceled, we've immediate sailing orders. Turn in all liberty card, all liberty is been canceled, we've immediate sailing orders. Sailing orders? Listen, I've got to get ashore. - I've started something I got to finish. - Yeah? Maybe you're lucky we're sailing. Put it in. ♪ Let yourself go, relax and let yourself go ♪ ♪ Relax, got yourself tied up in a knot ♪ ♪ The night is cold but the music is hot ♪ I got to go to bed Connie, I can't keep my eyes open any longer. Yes, it's late. Sherry, how much does a chief petty officer get? Whatever he told you, just cut it in half. Give me a chance, let me talk about Bake for a while, will you? Excuse me darling, you go right ahead. Of course, he would make more as master of his own ship, wouldn't he? I'll bet he's by far the best dancer in the Navy. - Yes, that's what he told me. - Who? Oh, you're talking about Bake. - Oh, it's swell Sherry, isn't it? - Isn't it? - What's the matter? - Oh, Bilge must've been right. About what? Well, he said they might've to leave anytime but it's sooner than I expected. - Who has to leave? What? Where? - The fleet. The fleet? Why, the dirty, double-crossing... Hey, what's going on? Dance team. Stand clear fellows, give everybody a chance to read it. Well, where is Bake? Prof. Baker will commence dancing class just as soon as he finishes painting the mainmast. You'd kept your trap shut, we wouldn't be doing this extra duty. When you weren't back by 2 o'clock this morning I had to think up some alibi for you. I told the quartermaster you had to stay with your mother who was very sick. Yeah, and when the officer of the deck... asked me where my mother was I said she was home in Texas. Well, how did I know you were going to be so dumb? I can understand them making you do this but why do they have to pick on me? What kept you out so late anyway? A very charming young lady with loads of dough. She was in show business too before she got married. But her husband didn't understand her so the poor kid had to go to Reno. Poor kid, I bet the chorus miss her. Well, she still sees them, there's nothing snooty about her. What about that teacher that was going to make you captain of her ship or something? She's a swell kid too but she's kind of serious. She's sappy like you, she wants to get married. I beg your pardon. One, two, three. One, two, three, try it. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. Now the left arm up, one, two, three. Right arm around the lady's waist. One, two, three. Now smile. One, two, three, all right. Let's see if you know what I told you. Now, you fellows get over there, you're the dames. - Dames? - What's the big idea? Well, you asked me to teach you how to dance, didn't you? All right then, you're dames. You fellows are their partners. All right music, now get together. Come on, get together, get together. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. Don't be bashful, grab them tight. One, two, three. One, two, three. That's better. One, two, three. Hey Bake, nobody will dance with me. Oh, that's too bad. Keep it up fellows, while I dance with the wallflower. Hey. You know, there's a difference between dancing and wrestling. In dancing, the main idea is to keep your partner's shoulders off the floor. I was taught to dance collegiate. Oh, that's different. Let's cut in. Hey, Marines. May I have the pleasure? Dancing class dismissed. What I can't understand Miss Connie, is why you want a floater. A girl can't handle a ship herself. No, but she may be able to get a man to do it for her. Well, I went over the ship like you asked me to and... there's lots to be done, cost quite a bit. Well, I've saved up about 600 dollars. And I'll add 400 which I got convoying the Navy around the dance floor on my feet. Even at that, I'm afraid 1000 dollars would hardly be enough. But... I'll tell the company what nice girls my old friend Captain Martin's daughters are and... - we'll see what we can do. - Thank you Captain Hickey. If you don't mind my saying so, I think he's a very lucky young man. Actually Captain Hickey, I consider this whole thing a business proposition. - Oh, yes. - Don't you believe it Captain Hickey., Little Red Riding Hood rides again. I hear the old man is entertaining a party of big shots this afternoon. I guess that's the reason for the dress white. Yeah. Hey Bake, I just got word I passed my exams. No kidding Bilge. Gee, that's swell, congratulations. - Thanks. - I knew you'd make it. I know you don't care to be taken on a tour of inspection Courtney. But I'd like to have you and the lady glance over the ship and take a look at our men. We'd love to Captain Jones. If it won't trouble you Jones, we'd enjoy it immensely. Mr. Gilbert, my party will look about the ship. See that attention is sounded, have the band play a march. Aye, aye sir. Hey, how about breaking up this sewing circle and getting into a jam session? Are you ready? - Your men are very smart lieutenant. - Thank you sir. - Mr. Gilbert. - Yes sir. - Have that jazz band stop playing at once. - Aye, aye sir. Silence. Baker... are you aware the captain is showing some guests around the ship... and attention is been sounded? I'm sorry sir, we didn't hear the call, we were playing. Captain... the orchestra was playing when attention was sounded and none of the men heard the call. I'm satisfied sir, they intend no breach of discipline. - Thank you Mr. Gilbert. - Aye, aye sir. Captain Jones, would you think it's a great breach of discipline... if I asked you to let them play for us? I do so adore American music. Not at all. Bugler, sound carry on. Division, dismissed. - Baker, please carry on as you intended. - Thank you sir.

You know, I wrote and explained what happened... but I never had an answer to any of my letters. Bilge, you don't think by any chance she could be sore at me, do you? I'd advise you to phone first and find out. Maybe you'd better phone for me, you're so masterful with women. You'll swab your own decks tonight. I got a heavy date that I made last October. Hello. - Oh hello Bake. - Is Sherry there? Oh, she's working, good. Then she's not sore at me. Oh, she is? Well, I'll be right up then.

Good, I'll wait. - Thank you, that's very nice. - Thank you Mr. Nolan. We'll be ready to hear you sing as soon as you've rested. - Well, how is she? - She's a great little dancer. But if she can sing too, she's the best bet we had in a long time. You better get a contract ready, Nolan be yelling for one if she can deliver a number. Ok. Hi Sullivan. Hello Baker, what's the idea of the outfit? It's a new act? - Yeah, an act of Congress. - So you joined the Navy. Well, so long as you don't want a job from me, I'm glad to see you. I want a job for somebody else. And she's just what Nolan is been looking for. You're too late, he's got somebody in there now, he's pretty much interested in. Yeah? Who is she? I don't know, just some little girl who came in. - May I have a drink of water please? - Why, certainly. Yes Mr. Nolan, right away. Take a glass of water to the young lady, she's going to sing now. And you better take the contract with you. - Alright. - Glad you dropped around. Thanks. There's nothing like nice drink of water for the voice, is there? - No, there isn't. - That's what I always say. Yeah. Well, so long Sullivan, I'll be seeing you, so long.

It's all right brother, that's what parties are for. - Hello Sherry. - Oh, hello Iris. Connie says she's singing in your place tonight, that you're not well, what's wrong? Well, I don't know. I've been feeling a little peculiar all afternoon. Oh, that's too bad. Why don't you try a little bicarbonate of soda, that might help. - Oh, hello, hello. - Don't you like? Boy, this reminds me of the Paradise. - I wonder where you buy the dance tickets. - Remember where you are son. The poor kid, she had to go to Reno. I'll see you later. Don't worry, I'll take care of everything. - What are you doing here? - I came with my pal. Oh no, wait a minute. You're not going to hold it against me for the rest of my life, are you? I waited all last night for you to return my call. - I wanted to explain about Jim Nolan. - Don't bother. I was there this afternoon and I fixed it all up for you. - At Jim Nolan's? - Yes, and it wasn't easy. There was a girl he was about to sign up. And she was getting ready to sing, she asked for a drink of water. What do you think I did? - What? - I put bicarbonate of soda in it. You what? Yeah, bicarbonate of soda. Can you imagine the expression on her face? Bake Baker, I'll get even with you as if it's the last thing I do. I must've said something. Bilge. Connie Martin. - Why yes, of course. - Well, well, how are you? - You're back, seems a long time, doesn't it? - Yes, when you come to think of it, it does. I was sort of expecting you last night. And when you didn't show up, well, I thought perhaps you'd forgotten me. Forgotten you? No, I had to stay on board last night. Oh, I realize that it was silly of me. Of course, somebody has to stay on board. Oh Bilge, I was so excited I didn't notice that you passed your exam. - I'm so glad. - Yeah, I am too. I've so many things to tell you, I don't know where to start. That's swell. I'll be glad to hear them some time. - Well, I'll see you later. - But, Bil... - What? - Yes sir. - Hey, can you imagine that? - What? Here I am, trying to drown my sorrows... when I get down a whole quart of the stuff the guy just tell me it's only grape juice. Come on, let's get out of here. What's the rush? Maybe the grape juice will make me feel happy anyway. - Remember that teacher I told you about? - Yeah. She's here and she was expecting me last night. Did you forget? No, I lied to her, told her I had to stay on board. Why? Oh, I don't want to wake up some morning and find myself married. Acted as cold as I could, a dame like that always makes me feel like a heel. Ah, she brings out your finer instincts. Come on. - Where have you been Bilgy? - Oh, I... I want you to meet my shipmate, Bake Baker. This is a friend of mine Mrs. Manning. - How do you do Mrs. Manning? - How do you do? I'm always happy to meet a friend of Bilgy. Yes. Sometime when I'm having a party I'll invite you to come. May I have the next dance? Thank you. I've been waiting for you, Bilgy. ♪ The moon is high, sky is blue ♪ ♪ And here am I but where are you? ♪ ♪ A night like this was meant for two ♪ ♪ And I am here but where are you? ♪ ♪ Have you forgotten the night that we met? ♪ ♪ With so much to remember, how could you forget? ♪ ♪ The dreams I dream have yet to come true ♪ ♪ My dreams and I are here but where are you? ♪ ♪ Have you forgotten the night that we met? ♪ ♪ With so much to remember, how could you forget? ♪ ♪ The dreams I dream have yet to come true ♪ ♪ My dreams and I are here but where are you? ♪ - Why aren't you wearing your uniform? - It's a custom of the Navy.

You mind if I borrow this for a moment? I'd like to show it to a friend. Certainly. Thank you so much, I'll bring it right back. - What's the matter? - Nothing. What is it? - You men are all alike. - Oh Sherry honestly, I didn't know was you. - That's not what I'm talking about. - Then tell me what's the matter. No. - If I only had someone to protect me. - What is it? What is it? I've never been so insulted in all of my life. - Who did it? What did he say? - Oh, I couldn't repeat it. Who was it? Point him out to me. That man over there near the pond. I don't like his face. Hey listen you landlubber, I know your type, you can't get away with a thing like that. He's lucky I slipped. - Let go of me. - Take it easy buddy. Let go of me. I'm awfully sorry this had to happen lieutenant. Thanks so much for the use of your ring. Return to your ship at once. Aye, aye sir. What's the matter Bake? You look sick. Can I get you some bicarbonate of soda? Sorry you're leaving so early Miss Martin. Oh, I have to get up early. I'm looking for my sister, have you seen her? - She was on the terrace a moment ago. - Thank you. - What's the matter with you tonight, Bilgy? - Nothing, why? - You're acting so funny. - Am I? Why, I don't mean to be. That's more like you were last night. This is tonight baby and remember the date for your diary. Now, remember what I told you. Well, look who's here, thank you very much. Where did you come from? It's all right son, you did your best. I know, she treats me that way too. I don't often try to apologize because I seldom make any mistakes. I thought we were all even after last night. Gosh Sherry, I didn't know you took this whole thing so seriously. - Don't flatter yourself. - It's Connie, she's going back home. Why, what's happened? Like a sap, she fell in love with a sailor. Well, look at you, I don't consider you a sap. Save that for the high class patter and genteel dance act. Connie won't listen to me, if she goes back to Bellport now, she just eat her heart out. Tell me who it is and I'll bring him back if I have to drag him to her. - She wouldn't want him that way. - Who is he? Oh, with the usual lack of imagination a sailor has, he told her his name was Smith. - They call him Bilge. - Bilge Smith? He's my shipmate. I might've guessed it. No seriously, Bilge is a swell guy, I'll talk to him. Bake, you don't understand, Connie wouldn't want him if things had to be explained. He's stuck on that Iris Manning. Say, what's she like? Anything in a uniform. There, don't you worry about it. I guess maybe I can take care of this matter. Captain Hickey, did you guarantee this whole thing personally? No, not exactly. I did tell them I sailed under your father. And if the amount isn't met, you're in danger of losing your job, aren't you? Well, I'm kind of sick of being a landlubber anyway. Oh, don't you worry about it child, goodbye Miss Connie.. - Ahoy Captain Hickey. - Ahoy Miss Sherry. Well... I want you to meet the United States Navy, Bake Baker. - How do you do Mr. Baker? - Captain Hickey. So this is the young man you've been moping about, eh? - Well, fair weather. - Thank you sir. Well, I don't suppose you can make it any worse than it is. You see what you can do with her. - Hello Bake. - Hello Connie. Sherry tell me you're leaving. Well, that's probably the wisest thing to do, run away. All this stuff about fighting for your man and all makes things so complicated. And if all girls would just give up... and run back to Bellport then we'd definitely see the end of family life. Little Junior would remain just an idea and every man would burn his own toast. I thank you. Well, I'm not leaving, staying right here. There, you see? I told you I'd fix it. Why Connie, that's swell, what happened? Well, I've been talking to Captain Hickey. He's about to lose his job for what he's done for me. I got to have 700 dollars by Saturday. Seven hundred dollars? We earn that in a week, but they don't pay it to us. There Mr. Baker, is something for you to manage. What do you say? I don't know Baker, if Nolan ever found out, he'd fire me. All I want is a loan of some scenery and costumes for the one night. Now, how he ever know? Well, let's see. We had a show called Mum's the Word that folded in four days. Those costumes were pretty cute but Nolan never liked them. - You can have those. - Thanks. And if you ever need a battleship, you can have mine. - So long boy. - So long. Hi, Bake. You know, rehearsal was called for four bells. Say Bake. Is there really going to be some dames in this show with us? If it's the fairer sex you're referring to the answer is yes. Hello, Sherry. - Look there. - How about that, eh? - These kids offered to help out. - Oh gee, that's swell of you. I wish that tall blonde angel would adopt me. You ain't fooling, either. Hello. How was heaven when you left? Tell me little boy, did you get a whistle or a baseball bat with that suit? Bomber and his blonds. Thanks fellows, I can see you guys don't appreciate high art. What's the matter Sherry? It's Connie, she say she's going back to Bellport after the show anyway. I wish there is something we could do for her. That Manning woman. Maybe something can be done. But look, let's not worry about it now, we ought to run through that new number. We haven't been through the dance completely though. I know, but let's take a crack at it anyway, there isn't much time. - Come on fellows, let's have it, will you? - A flat fellows. ♪ I've been a roaming Romeo my Juliets have been many ♪ ♪ But now my roaming days have gone ♪ ♪ Too many irons in the fire is worse than not having any ♪ ♪ I've had my share and from now on ♪ ♪ I'm putting all my eggs In one basket ♪ ♪ I'm betting everything I've got on you ♪ ♪ I'm giving all my love to one baby ♪ ♪ Heaven help me if my baby don't come through ♪ ♪ I got a great big amount ♪ ♪ Saved up in my love account ♪ ♪ Honey, and I decided love divided in two won't do ♪ ♪ So I'm putting all my eggs In one basket ♪ ♪ I'm betting everything I got on you ♪ ♪ I'm putting all my eggs in one basket ♪ ♪ I'm betting everything I got on you ♪ ♪ I'm giving all my love to one baby ♪ ♪ Heaven help me if my baby don't come through ♪ ♪ I tried to love more than one finding it just can't be done ♪ ♪ Honey, there's one I lie to when I try to be true to two ♪ ♪ So I'm putting all my eggs in one basket ♪ ♪ I'm betting everything I got on you ♪ I'm moving my gear up to the chief's quarters, would you mind getting... that riveting machine out of the way so that I can get to my locker? Don't bother me son, the show must go on. Why? Why? I don't know why but that's they say always say. I hear you're putting on a show with the Martin girls. Yeah. What are you doing tonight Bilge? I got a date with Mrs. Manning at 10 o'clock. Well, I'll be seeing you. Was I long darling? Was I long darling? Was I long, darling? Was I long darling? And every hour away from you seems like a day. - Mr. Bake Baker. - Yes. - Mr. Baker, I'm so happy to see you again. - Oh, thank you. It's so thoughtful of you to ask me to join your show. - Oh, I see you have the part I sent. - Yes... it's rather short order to learn by tomorrow night but then I spent the entire afternoon studying it, I think I know it quite well. Oh, that's fine. I just thought I'd drop in to run through it with you... - since we haven't much time. - Mr. Smith isn't here yet. Oh, he'll be here. Shall we start? Well, now, I thought we'd make this a sort of a dress rehearsal. Oh, dress rehearsal? - I'm supposed to wear a negligee. - Yes, it's very important to the scene. - This is going to be a lot of fun, isn't it? - You'll be surprised. Well, I'll rush and slip one on. - It'll be more effective that way, won't it? - Oh, definitely yes. Yes. Mrs. Manning is waiting for you on the porch sir. Thank you Benson. I know, it's Bilgy. - What are you doing here? - Who, me? Oh, I'm here at Mrs. Manning's special invitation. Have a cigar. I'll call for a drink for you. Hey, Max. What's this all about? Oh, my being here? Iris and I have developed a very close friendship ever since the night of her party. Listen, how far is this thing gone? Well, you know Bilge, you and I are both men of the world. Don't make me laugh. You wouldn't like to make a little bet or anything, would you? Any amount you say. - Ten bucks? - All right with me. - You wait out there and keep your eyes open. - Ok. Was I long darling? Was I... Was I long, darling? Every minute seemed like an hour, babe. And every hour away from you seems like a day. - You're not expecting anyone else, are you? - Well, I was. But when I heard you could come I told my servants I wasn't home to anyone but you... Bakey. And to think we've only known each other these few days. Of course, there have been other men in my life... but they all seem like such petty, unimportant people since I met you. Yes, I understand. Tell me, have there ever been any other women in your life? - You're the first. - Oh, my darling, you make me so happy. There, there. Sorry if I'm interrupting anything. And you're supposed to be my pal. How dare you enter like this. What right have you to come prying, forcing yourself into my private life? - But I... - Understand this. I was only playing with you and you poor sap, fell for it. Will you leave or do I have to ring for the butler? Don't trouble yourself. Well, how was I? Oh, you were swell, nobody could've done the part as well as you. I was all confused at the end because... Bilgy didn't say his lines the way they were written. No, but he got the general sense of it. Isn't Bake here yet? No, the boys say he didn't leave in their boat with them. No one seems to know what's happened to him. I might've known, a little thing like this show is just slipped his mind. I'll bet he's with the admiral telling how to run the fleet. Well, if he doesn't come we'll just have to return the money. - Without Bake, we'll have no show. - And without a show, we'll have no Bake. Oh, why did they let the rest of the men go and keep me? I got to get to that show. All I know is that orders are your liberty has been canceled. You know, I'll bet you did this to get even with me for last night. Well, if you think I did it, go ask your executive officer. Ok admiral, I'll do that. Seaman Baker would like to speak with the executive officer. Just a minute. Seaman Baker requests permission to see you sir. Permission granted. Here's Baker now. - Executive officer will see you. - Thank you. Yes Baker? I beg your pardon sir, I've changed my mind. Just a moment, we've been talking about you. Lieutenant Williams came aboard to discuss you with me. I'm sincerely sorry about the other evening sir. - I didn't know you were an officer. - I realize that Baker. Lt. Williams is been very generous about the whole thing. He's just been interceding for you. Thank you sir. May I go ashore now sir? Your name is on the report. The captain will probably scratch it tomorrow at mast. But until then, you must remain aboard. - But sir, I... - That will be all Baker. Aye, aye sir. Well, wise guy, did you get your liberty pass? Where do you think you going without the liberty? - Where you think? - Now, wait a minute.. - Are you crazy? - I'm not crazy, I'm going. You're not going, you know the orders. I don't care what the orders are, I'm going. Cut it out, will you? Oh gee kid, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you. I forgot myself. Come on Bake, hit me. Hey water taxi, stand by. Bake. - What is it quartermaster? - It's a man jumping ship sir. - You know who it is? - Yes sir, it's seaman Baker. Smith. Get a detail of men and arrest seaman Baker immediately. Aye, aye sir. You got to be ready by the third chorus. Now, go get your clothes on, hurry kids. - Is he here yet? - No. - Hello Sullivan. - Hello Mr. Nolan. Glad to see you taking so much interest in scouting talent. Yes Mr. Nolan, I'd known you were coming I'd have changed my plans. Oh, that's all right, glad to see you. Let's sit together. Baker sent a note telling me he had a Monte Carlo idea he got when the fleet was there. I'm anxious to see it, might be able to use it. - He's a smart lad. - In more ways than one. Sullivan... look at that costume. That's the kind we should've used in Mum's the Word. Yes sir. - Shore patrol coming aboard on duty. - Aye, aye sir. You men patrol the docks and see he doesn't get off the ship. Wonder what this is all about. - Hello Connie. - Oh, it's you, what are you doing here? - I've come to arrest Bake. - Arrest Bake? Why? He jumped ship, my orders are to bring him back. Well, couldn't you wait til after the show? I don't bring him back right away, it'll cost me my stripes. Well, I guess you better make your arrest then, he's in there. Thanks. Connie, I've been wanting to say this to you but I... I don't know how. Can't we start again, just like we did the beginning? I'm afraid you missed the beginning, this is the end of the show. You're under arrest Bake. - I guess I didn't hit you hard enough. - Come on, we got to get back to the ship. You win. You may as well know, that all the thing with Iris Manning last night was a gag. What? Yeah, I frame you to show you that while you were running around with a... bottle of peroxide you were passing up a girl you were nuts about. That's my business. Tried to make up with her, she wouldn't look at me. I don't blame her. You know why this show is being given? Help Connie pay off this ship. - Is this the Connie Martin? - It ain't the Joe Doakes. - She didn't tell me she salvaged it. - She salvaged for you, you sap. She knew I was going to arrest you, and she told me where you were. That's the kind of a girl she is. You go on with this show. - What about the patrol? - I'll stall them off until you get through. Oh no, just because I'm in a jam, there's no need for you to get in one. Those are orders, do as I tell you. Maybe they won't be putting us in the same cell together anyway.

Tell Mr. Nolan we'll be happy to consider his proposition... as soon as Mr. Baker gets out of the brig, which is one thing he can't fix. - Ok. - Wait a minute, there's one condition.
