I was living in Chicago... with a friend of mine named Clem Floyd. Clem was going with a little German hooker named, uh, "The Duchess." She was about 4-feet-2 and cute. And, uh, very popular. And we were as stoned as we could get. We took everything we had and anything anybody else had. We were gonna go hear John Coltrane. He was a hero. So they would play this tune, ensemble, and then Trane would start sawing. You know, 15, 20 minutes. He'd be blowing pretty hard. And I was very high. Got to be too much for me. I went and ducked into the men's room. And I got my head against this puke-green tile. I can still remember the color of the tile. And I'm, like, thinking: "Okay, it's gonna be all right now. Just get it together now. It's gonna be okay." Bam! Somebody kicks the door open. Bam! It's Trane. He's kicked the door open because he's... ... playing at the most intense level you could ever imagine in your life. He never stopped soloing. He's still soloing, and he's up where it's really hitting the thousand mark, you know? He's, like, burning. I never heard anybody be more intense with music than that in my life. In that little bathroom. Little tile bathroom. Whew. People ask me if I got regrets. Yeah. I got a huge regret about the time I wasted being smashed. I'm afraid. I'm afraid of dying. And I'm close. I don't like it. I'd like to have more time. A lot more time. This is, um, Big Sur Folk Festival. And that's Christine right there. This is the four of us. I think that would've been the cover for Human Highway. That's me back before I had the mustache. The Byrds. God, that's a great shot of Miles. That's the intensity right there. Me and Neil. Me and Garcia. God bless Jerry Garcia. This is me and the Lighthouse band goofing off at a great moment, and it's just, I'm so happy right there. If I were to come to you and say: "No music, you don't get any of that, but you get extreme joy in your home life and an incredible family..." No music? No music. Would you make that trade? That's no world for me. And is that a selfish thing? I don't know. Maybe. But no. Me, music? No music? No, not interested. It's the only thing I can contribute, man. It's the only thing— place I can help. It's the only place I can make it better. It's the only thing I got to offer, really. I don't want to go. I got a lot of stuff I'm trying to do. I'm touring because I— I'm touring because I love to sing. I do, uh, need to tour, to just simply buy groceries and pay my—my mortgage. The hardest part is just leaving home. I don't like to leave home. I love my wife. I love my son. I love, I love it here. Hi, Mama! How's my girl? I'm under some pressure, yeah. You gotta understand, I'm the guy in Crosby, Stills and Nash, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, that's never had a hit. Black. Hi, Black. The way I get through it is I know what he's going toward. I know what makes him the happiest. I'm 76 years old. I've had... two or three heart attacks. I've got eight stents in my heart. You know, I had hepatitis C, which destroyed my liver, which made me have to have a transplant. I'm diabetic. That does kill you in the long run. But I'm happy. I don't think people know how sick he really is. I'm so glad he's as stubborn as he is and wants to sing anyway. I might say, "Hey, honey, I think you should stay here, and go see the heart people right now and not go out on that tour," and he'll go, "Fuck you. I'm going." And I have to be okay with that. I have to say, "Go, honey. Have fun." And I might not ever see him again. At this point in my life, every... minute that you get, you know, is—It's precious. Time is the final currency. And so how do you spend it? I wanted him to choose family first, and I thought he would. This is really where I feel alive. The only solace I have is that when the light does go out, I hope it's when he's singing. ♪ Guinnevere ♪ ♪ Had green eyes ♪ ♪ Like yours, milady... ♪ Man, I hate leaving. I just hate leaving home.

No. When I first met Joni down in Florida, she was singing, you know, at a coffeehouse, and, uh, I was pretty much stunned by her.

Now, Joni has said that, at that point, she felt like you were parading her around. I did exactly that.

And then she finished the song and looked at me, with this intense, angry expression on her face, and then she sang it again. There's no one like Joni Mitchell.

Death is not something that we can talk about. You know, nobody talks about death. There's just this emptiness. Gone. You know, it's like a rip in the fabric. An empty place. Leaves a big hole.

And we'd heard about it on the radio, and we just couldn't conceive of it. Tear gas first started down the commons. Then the Guard moved up on both sides of Taylor Hall, and forced the kids off the commons, and all of a sudden, I heard the shooting. Then I saw people dropping to the ground. Today, the guardsmen opened fire on the students, killing four of them, two young men and two young women. Three were shot in the chest and one in the head. A dozen or more others were wounded, some by gunfire and some by bayonets. The students were protesting the American invasion of Cambodia. And I watched it hit Neil. Wham! It was like he'd been punched. Crosby came up, and he had the magazine with the Kent State killings cover on it. And I'd heard it on the news, what had happened, and... But Crosby always has a way of bringing things into focus. That's what really woke me up. Neil picked up the guitar and wrote the song right in front of me. And I called Nash and said, "Get a studio. Now." And our record company president, a wonderful man named Ahmet Ertegun, he told everybody, "Look, this record has to go out tomorrow." As soon as I heard the song, it felt right.

He just wanted it to happen. He wanted to coax it into happening, any kind of way. If it meant get down on the floor and lick the notes off the floor, he'd do it. He'd do whatever. He knew it was waiting to happen right around the edges of the picture, and he wanted to invite those notes out. "Come on. Come on, little notes. Come on out, come on out."

All of a sudden, nothing hurts. You feel... exalted and wonderful. Only the first time. After that, you're just trying to catch it. You're just trying to go back there. And you never get back there. Ever. Addiction takes you over like fire takes over a burning building. And I went completely off the rails. It's a weird kind of spiral, man. You are mad at yourself for being a dick, so you do more drugs, which makes you more of a dick, which makes you more mad at yourself. But what's the high phase? What's the phase that keeps you going back? It's—You don't get it. They're not to get high. They're for anesthesia. That's why people get smashed on hard drugs, is they don't want to be here. They want to suppress here and now. They want to live more inside of their dream. Or their nightmare. I was warned by many, many people. In fact, some close-up-to-him people, uh... begged me not to get near him. And I was already smitten. I was already in the dance. When I saw him doing drugs, I thought, "What—What is that? Why is everybody so scared of it? Wait a minute. Give me some of that, and let me see what it is. Maybe if I can figure that out, I can pull you out." And that was really all I meant to do. Croz, do you ever wonder why you are still alive? I don't know. No idea, man. I—Why me? Look at all these people, buddies of mine, that died, man. Janis. Cass. Hendrix. Those are friends of mine. They all died from the same thing, the same way. How come I didn't? I was doing the same drug. I overdosed. They had to bring me back a couple times. How come? How come I'm not dead? At a certain point there, the drugs became more important than anybody or anything, including music. I let those guys down terribly, man, when I became a junkie. I went right down the tubes in front of them, and they watched the band, you know, like, go all to shit because I couldn't pull my weight. I had already decided that someday I was gonna get that call. "Did you hear about David?" And that would be it. Like, he'd be dead, you know. You'd go... Because you can't live that way and not, you know, pay the consequences. Did I ever tell you about the time Neil came and offered me to come to his ranch and stay there and get sober? He was genuine about it. He wanted to help me. What were you using? Coke and heroin. Both. Nash and Jackson were both very concerned. Tried repeatedly to get me to quit. They were two of the key people running the intervention on me. It was—It was quite a— quite a gathering of people. Jan, who was in just as bad a shape as he was... I mean, they were addicts, you know? And the drill was to try to convince them that they should, you know, like, really: "Take it from us, you're heading for the wall. You got to stop. You got to do something. You know, we don't want to lose you." It was an all-night thing. He agreed to go into Scripps, like a hospital. And he stayed there exactly one day and split the next day. ♪ Homeward Through the haze... ♪ After that, they pretty much stopped trying. He was convicted of drug and weapons charges in 1983. Since then, he's been arrested on additional drug and hit-and-run charges. He had been forced by the courts to go to a rehab center and left without permission. And at that point, he became a fugitive from the law. It was just a matter of days before somebody put my picture up in the post office. We fled. A dealer guy got us a plane ride. On a single-engine airplane. All the way across the country. Took us three days. Guy was a good pilot. Uh, I think he'd been a drug runner. And I went and found my boat. Because I thought somehow I could go back and touch my touchstone, and it would somehow save me from what I knew was coming. I went to the boat, and she was in terrible shape. Nobody had been taking care of her at all because I hadn't given them any money to. I lay there and lay there, and days passed. And I gave up. Big moment. And I got a ride to the local FBI agency. And I walked in. He said, "Yeah, can I help you?" I said, "You're looking for me. My name's David Crosby." He said... "Step over against the wall." I think I'm probably facing some time, but I would like to get it done with and go back to playing music. That's all I really want to do. When I gave myself up, Jan D. came back, and a doctor friend of ours got her into a treatment place in Monterey. Do you have any comments for us? Wish me luck, huh? When I went in prison, cut both ways. "Hey, rock star, how you feel now, huh? Bet you wish you was out there getting laid and having a lot of money now, don't you, huh?" When I went into prison, I was nearly dead. I'm kicking two major, heavily addictive, really terrible drugs without even an aspirin. I'd lost pretty much everything. I'd hit bottom, blown my money. I spent four months in solitary. They lock you in a steel box and feed you through the door. And in prison, I woke up in a cell, remembered who I was and started writing again. And that was the beginning of the road back. "Compass" was the first decent song I wrote. ♪ I have wasted ♪ ♪ Ten years... ♪ When I got out of prison, I thanked the judge for sending me away because it got me off hard drugs.

For a guy who was supposed to be dead a couple of years ago, I'm doing pretty well. I wanna thank the two men standing next to me because they've been brothers to me. They've stuck with me through thick and thin. They waited. They helped. They cried sometimes. They swore at me sometimes. But they've been my brothers all the way down the line. Without them, I could not have made this music, and I love them dearly. And I thank you both, guys. We have made really good music together, and I'm very grateful for every bit of it. I think CSNY is a completely different band than CSN, completely different, and should be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its own, by the way. I should be in there a third time, just to make Clapton jealous. We really did like each other when we first started playing, and we were thrilled by each other's songs. Bands get together, and you're in love with each other, and it's all wonderful and it's exciting, but 40 years later, heh, it devolves into just turn on the smoke machine and play your hits. ♪ Almost ♪ ♪ Cut my hair... ♪ Got to the point where we didn't like each other, didn't ride the same bus. We were competing all the time. If I'd bring in one of my new weird songs, they didn't want to learn it. And I mean, we've been so unkind to each other. We've hurt each other. All of us have hurt each other. We've done terrible things to each other many times. Everybody in the band has, at many times. Me probably more than anybody else. My big fuck-up is getting mad. You didn't ask me, but I'll volunteer it. Biggest mistake I make: getting mad. Um... Once the adrenaline hits my system, it's just, like, instant asshole. What's the get-off for you? There isn't any. There's no good about it. There's no pleasure, there's no enjoyment. There's nothing except... Once the adrenaline takes ahold, you're... in the grip of it, and you say stuff and do stuff that's just awful. I shot my mouth off about Neil's girlfriend. I didn't realize the guy was gonna put it on the Net. I thought the interview was over. So, Neil's pissed at me, and he's not gonna work with me. He says, "No more CSNY ever!" So my dream of you guys reuniting, having a little concert, maybe doing the Déjà Vu album— - That'll never happen. - Never happen? - No. If you make a mistake, you got to fix it right away. Yeah. I shouldn't have said it anyway. I apologized for it, but it doesn't do any good. And it just—It just went downhill from there. The Graham that I have in my head is on stage with me in Scandinavia someplace, Norway or somewhere, and he's screaming at me... in my face, from about this far away, spittle hitting me in the face, and he's screaming: "You don't get it, do you? You mean nothing to me now! Nothing! I hate you! Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!" Spit. Punching in the chest. On stage, in front of an audience. He was, on that tour, coming on stage and not looking at me. The whole night, he would sing facing Stills and just try to pretend I wasn't there. I always wanted to have a buddy, a brother, a, you know... partner. It is my pleasure to introduce two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash.
