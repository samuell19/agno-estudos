- Hey, this is Sandy Shore, KEWL, right in the middle of a flashbang '80s weekend with that monster hit, You Make Me Come Alive. - Oh, my mom loves this song. - Turn it up. - Wow, we should stop at the beach. - You have to go tan at the beach. I bet we could find some cute surfer boys. - Surfers, what water does to hair. What are you doing after graduation? - My dad said so many Baby Boomers are dying, I should get into health care. He says it's a real growth industry. I just don't wanna touch old people that much. I wanna work with animals. - I just wanna get away for a while. Always wanted to go to London. Oh by the way, Kyle was talking about this cute cheerleader, how hot she is, and then he said your name. - Wow, he's cute. - I heard he's kind of a player. - What do you mean? - Beverly told Angel that he did it with that redheaded chick Tanya and then two days later he did it with her best friend. But you can't believe everything you hear. - People love to talk about people behind their backs. - Yeah. I love driving down Sunset Boulevard. This is where all the L.A. bands got famous. The Whiskey a Go Go, the Viper Room. That's where River Phoenix died. - Who's River Phoenix? - I love the monster on the building. - Hollywood, there's so many people. - You're lucky, my dad says he always finds people with nowhere to go and all day to get there. - Have you ever been to the Chinese theater? Very cool. - Capital Records building, they do downloads there. ♪ I think I'm gonna jump and shout ♪ - How much longer? It feels like we've been driving for hours. - This traffic is unbelievable, look at that. - What's it called again, Camp Cheer? I googled it. Can you believe they don't even have a website? - No website, I don't trust a place without a website. - Oh chill, my mom called and talked to somebody. - I just hope there's at least one cute guy there. ♪ You make me, you make me, you make me come alive ♪ ♪ Oh you make me, you make me come alive ♪ ♪ You make me, make me, make me, you make me come alive ♪ ♪ Oh baby, oh you make me ♪ You make me come alive ♪ You make me, you make me, you make me come alive ♪ - Hey! - Hey, welcome to Camp Cheer. - Hi, we're here to register. - Well you don't want to give that to me.

I can see everything coming. Reminds me of driving a combine back on the farm. - You grew up on a farm? - Yes ma'am. Tell you what, those were the days. Horses, bonfires, swimming in ponds. Oh don't worry, it's not loaded, it's just a pellet gun. Now you have to respect your weapons but they for shooting varmints around here. You know like rattlesnakes and rats, rabid squirrels, raccoons, groundhogs. I'll never get that week back. - I mean is there anything else we can be afraid of, we are pretty tough. - Well I'm sure you girls are, but this place actually offers a self defense course once a month, maybe you can learn a thing or two. - Well I have my brothers, we're always throwing each other around, so. Plus I'm pretty fast, we are a cheerleader and all so, strong, fast, and twisty. - Yeah that's right, damn maybe I can learn a thing or two. Now I'll tell you what, I need some backup, I'll come to you girls first. - Oh have fun with that. - Oh I will.

There's a girl here from Yugoslavia or something like that, and I think she's gonna end up being alone 'cause the rest of her squad got detained coming through customs. - Oh no. - Well I was wondering if maybe y'all could welcome her and just show her around the camp a little bit. It'll be a lot of help to me. - Sure. - Okay. - Hey thanks.

I can't believe how crowded the roads are way out here. - Look at that waterfall. - This must be the place. - What time did the falcon cheer squad say they were getting here? - I thought they said two, but I was texting. Maybe four. - What time is it? - Two. - Let's just wait a few more minutes. - That was a total waste of time. - What now? - Let's drive by the lake on the way back. - I think it's coming up, the next exit, take this exit. ♪ Oh, too slow ♪ Drop it low ♪ Oh ♪ Drop it low ♪ Too slow ♪ Oh - Hey Lana, are you okay? - Hey we don't even have any reception here. - Oh yeah I can't get any either. - Bye. ♪ Yeah - We have our first contestant, her name is Lisette.

Hey cheerleaders! - They saw us. - We'll get 'em later. - Attention Camp Cheer finalists, just want to make a little announcement here. I've been notified by my good buddy, Police Captain Flores about a break-in at a government facility down the road. - There's a government facility around here? - There's government facilities everywhere. There's one around here that does defense satellites. - That sounds very significant. - Police are investigating and they think the culprits are still in the area. - Should we be scared? - Tough girls like you, what do you have to be scared of? - I'm sure there's no immediate danger, but it would probably be a good idea to make sure your cars are locked and your eyes are open. - Should we be scared? - If you see something, say something and let me know. I'm around if anyone needs me. - Watch it. - It's heavier than I thought it was. - All right, here we go. - Mr. Axel. - Just Axel, what's going on? - There were these two guys in the alley and they buried something, they had a white van. - Calm down, let's just go check it out and see what we're dealing, okay, come on. Hey Miss, don't go in there. That's not a good exit, Miss! - Why, why, why! It said exit, it said exit! - Hmm. Look, y'all just stay here okay. - They hid it under that piece of wood. - Um, is this what you saw? All right, look let's just go and keep this safe. Let's head on back. - They're so sloppy, with their routine like that, they'll never win. - Not against us. - She can't even do a cartwheel right. - See that girl right there, thunder thighs. - See that one, daddy long legs. - You guys are so mean. - Truth hurts. - See her hair, totally fake. - Fake hair, fake personality. - See their outfits, awful. - Those colors don't even match. - It's so bad, let's just go downstairs.

Okay. I'll get you and your little dog too. - Yeah boss, I got eyes on the place. It should be no problem at all. We got some cheerleaders and some camp manager. Some hillbilly hick looking type. A cowboy hat. We should make quick work of him. Yeah, no problem. Yeah I see another cheerleader now. This place is gonna be easy to take down. I think, I think she's eating a cucumber. - Michelle come look at this. - Oh come on. Is that what a real lumber Jack looks like? - We should go talk to him. - Oh okay, here's another one. I don't know what the hell she is doing though. She's walking into the theater now. And then she walked right out. I'm gonna go check the other side of the camp. - Hey come on. - That's the chick that was eating the cucumber. Yeah boss, your plan is perfect. They're all gonna be inside at this 80s dance party. - How we looking? - That should be a fun time tonight. - Yeah I've never been to an 80s party before. - And that's it, that's all right.

They took Theo! - Girls, what's going on? - Please help, we shouldn't have taken their stuff. - They left a ransom note. - Trade dog for our stuff, 5:30 tomorrow, here. Poor little guy. - All right look, listen, listen, come here, come here. Listen, we're gonna get Theo back I promise okay. - Okay. - What I need you guys to do is, I need you to go back to your room right now and I'm gonna try to work on a plan. - Okay. - All right. - At least we know he's gonna be okay until tomorrow all right. - Really? - How could you be so heartless. - All right girls, girls go back to y'alls rooms okay. I'm gonna come up with a plan and we're gonna get Theo back, all right? This reminds me of that time I shot that groundhog. Yeah. I got it. - Axel has a plan okay. Are you okay? - No, leave me alone. I can't believe he's gone. - He's not gone. - Should have never come here. Should have never brought Theo. - Oh! - Mr. Johnson told me to use this shower because mine was out of order. Are you guys okay? What's the matter, what happened? - They took Theo. - They took your dog? Who would do that? - They want an exchange. - We were sunbathing when we saw these guys in the alley, and then they hid something, and then they saw us, and then we went told Axel, and then we got it, and then they took Theo, and now he's gone. - What you gonna do? - Axel has a plan, it's just no particular one. - Well I will help you. Let me take this off my face and I'm gonna talk to you. We'll get your dog. - I got it. - You know what, I want to take a chainsaw to those guys that took Theo. - I don't blame you, but violence is never the answer. - Guys. - Okay look, Theo wouldn't want us laying around crying right? - Right, he's strong and so are we. - Hey so we got this, let's do it. - Come on. - Thanks for coming girls. Now, this is our camp and we're gonna get Mr. Theo back, I promise. And here's how. By a show of hands, how many of you been groundhog hunting? All right better question, how many of y'all know what a ground hog is? Just, just know basically the point is you got to get there before the groundhog, and you got to be ready. Now this plan that I have come up with has a job for each of you, okay? Here's what's going down. Everything was checked and double checked. I've dealt with low lives before and I knew I had to come up with something they wouldn't expect. They didn't know who they were dealing with. Axel Johnson, the fourth. Tension in the air was so thick, even the dogs were getting antsy. Just like I told the girls about the groundhogs, I knew they'd be coming early. AJ had been out front all morning watching, just in case. I had set up the meeting to our advantage. The girls were ready and waiting at strategic points. Pamela was supposed to be on the gate, Andrea was in the palm fronds, and that Yugoslavia cheerleader was in the other palm fronds. Even one of those promoters was standing by. He was itching to tag on it. I'd managed to get the place pretty much emptied out to minimize any collateral damage. Attention all Camp Cheer finalists, the hospitality suite has been set up for you at the high school. We hope you all have a good time exploring our town. Remember you don't have to be back until dark. Anyway, I was ready. The final cars were leaving. I can, I can feel 'em. - All right guys, here's the plan. We're gonna double cross them. - What do you mean? - We told them 5:30 arrival, let's get there at 3:30. You know what scratch that, make it three o'clock. - Okay. - Give me one second. Yeah. - They're gone, all right great thanks. - Who was that? - That was Nick and Vic, I had them early doing a stakeout. We're gonna go in and out real quick. All right got it, let's go. Let's go, let's go right now, let's do this. - We got this, everybody just stay calm and stick to the plan. Since AJ was mayor, he done had two kids and had been baiting a previous altercation, I decided to send him out to cover the back gate. Just stay on your toes. Our resident lumberjack, Easel Johnson, no relation, had volunteered to be bait, you know to let them think they had the upper hand. Actually, we figured there were gonna try to knock him out, so he kind of volunteered to be more of a pinata. We were all waiting for them, and we had a few surprises of our own. Any minute now. I got 'em. Everyone get ready, looks like the party's about to begin. - They just passed checkpoint A. - Copy, now real quick sneak back into stage one the back way. - They just passed point B. - Copy, meet up with Michelle, and get ready to take these guys down. You have to press the button and let it go. No don't press it again. No okay, I know it's confusing Lana. Lana, Lana, okay Jacob do your thing. - Yeah I see 'em, I'm moving to stage one as per plan. - Copy and get ready to take these guys down. - Gotcha. - Get ready Diesel, they're right behind you. You're ready. See a pinata. - Where's Theo? - Shh, I'm talking to you, you little cheerleader. Who are you? - Axel Johnson, I'm the manager here. - Well Axel Johnson, is that for me? - Well that depends, you got the dog? - Yeah I got the dog, he's outside. I got proof of life. - Theo. - Where I come from, we don't treat pretty little ladies like this. - I don't care where you come from, just give me the stuff I want. - Here's your schematics, take it and get the hell out of here. - It's all in here. All there. - Yeah. - Come here, come here you. - Na, na, na, na, na. I'm right here. - Let's do this. - This is bull crap man, let's get the stuff and get out of here. - Put the mask on. - I hate this mask. - All wrapped up here officer. - All right, let's go you pinheads. Nice job everyone. - Hey boys, when you get downtown, say hey to Big D for me. The authorities showed up quickly. Things started moving fast after the police took those pinheads away. Turns out they were working for a slimy lawyer with government credentials. He was trying to make a quick buck selling satellite schematics to some shady foreign types. - Look, they had the schematics on them when they were picked up. Mental giants, didn't want to take this job. Is that a threat? Yeah, I don't like your tone of your voice. What do you mean you know where my family is? You don't even know where you wife is. - Oddly he disappeared and he was never seen or heard from again. But the plot was foiled, and actually it was a pretty big deal. Meanwhile, as you may have guessed, the girls went on to win the finals. Big celebration. But, that was just the beginning. When news of what happened got out, and with an election coming up, the mayor and the local politicos all joined in. We all become well I'll just say it, celebrities. And Ms. Pamela and Ms. Andrea, were awarded scholarships, went to NYU and then were recruited into Homeland Security right away. Ms. Michelle, followed her dream and used her scholarship to become a successful veterinarian up in Santa Barbara. She's a top dog in the state's animal rights campaign. The Yugoslavian chick, well she went back to Yugoslavia. From what she said I guess it's down right beautiful there. When there's not war going on. I think it's called Bosnia now.

Before we separated ways, Homeland Security brought us in on a couple of investigations. They thought our talents could be of use. Sort of a modern day Charlie's Angels. You have a couple of hours, grab a glass of your favorite beverage. You should already have your shoes off. And cozy up, you're in for a treat. This was a weird case. There's no motive, no weapon, no witnesses, except for the dog. When the police finally arrived, they just tried to knock the door down. That's when I started to thinking, perfect job for the girls. Ms. Michelle hit the roof, squeezed through a 12 inch pipe for the AC, I have no idea how. Don't care, Ms. Andrea, hit the tunnels. Came up from underneath the building. Ms. Pamela repelled down the side, cut a hole in the glass and that's that. What no one realized this entire time was there's a dog tied to the bike rack 15 feet from the door. So, I called the best pet psychic detective in the state. Took about 15 minutes to get there from helicopter. That give the girls just plenty of time to get in place. When she arrived, took her about a minute or two to squeeze that information out of the chihuahua. A slight communication barrier 'cause it only spoke Spanish. But once we got the information the girls were ready. Broke into the building and rescued the hostage.
