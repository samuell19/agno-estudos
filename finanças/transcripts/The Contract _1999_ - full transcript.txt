I'm good to go. Excuse me, miss. You can't stay here. You have to move. - I'm sorry. She's just a little fussy. Carlos, get your hands off that lady. My boys, they have no manners. [silenced gunshots] Alonzo says hello. [gunfire] REPORTER: This was the scene today on 3rd and 58th Street, where a wild shoot out in broad daylight resulted in six deaths. Among the dead were notorious mafia boss Anthony Vecchio. Vecchio, known on the streets as Little Tony, was embroiled in a power struggle with mob underboss Victor Alonzo for control of the Le Senso crime family. Police have no suspects so far and have refrained to comment. That was absolutely perfect. Thank you. No, I'm OK. Are you sure? Mm-hmm. You're turning out to be a good chef. Well, if I left it up to you, Luc, we'd have take out every night. Know your limitations. That's my motto. And besides, no mess. I'd love to stay and chit chat about the pros and cons of take out versus home cooking. But I do have a semblance of a life, you know. Ah, leave that. Where are you off to? Nowhere. Nowhere? Why do I get the distinct feeling you're not telling me everything? Because I'm not. Goodnight, Luc. Don't wait up, OK? - LUC: Goodnight, sweetheart. Today, Senator Harmon-- LUC: Have fun. --former director of the CIA, announced his intentions to run for the leadership of the Republican Party. Harmon, a Vietnam veteran and renowned hardliner, surprised insiders by making his announcement on the steps of the Senate building. It is expected the senator will hold a formal press conference later this week. It's time to stop talking, and start acting. How's your family, Jimmy? REPORTER: Senator-- Hey, honey. How are you doing? Hi. Good. How are you? - I'm good. Good. - Good to see you. - You, too. What are you doing here? I've come to see you. That's nice. And have a sneak preview. Sneak preview, all right, well, we can-- I'll show you this room. It's finished. OK. So are you gonna be ready for tomorrow? Yeah, you know, l was really, really nervous about this show. But, uh, well, you know what? I'll just take you in, and you can see for yourself. Wow, James. This is incredible. These pieces are excellent. I'm so proud of you. It's all coming together. - Slowly but surely. - Yeah. I've got so much work to still do, though. I mean, you saw the front gallery. I've-- I've still got to get that all dressed. I mean, half of these paintings arrived before you got here, you know? - Really? Oh, yeah, I mean, trying to get an artist to meet a deadline is like pulling teeth sometimes, you know? Yeah, some of these are beautiful. Oh, I love this one. This kid is 23 years old. He's already painting at this level. I mean, it blows my mind. He's going to be huge. And that's all thanks to you. You know? And I'm going to be there front and center tomorrow. Mm-hmm. Why aren't your paintings up there? Well, I don't know. The market's really fallen through for the dogs playing poker. Now I'm stuck with all this velveteen. Not everything has to be a masterpiece, though, James. You know? I think, um, I think you need to be inspired a little bit. - Inspired? - Yes, I do. I'm not sure I'm following you. Well, let me show you. Hmm, no, not getting anything there. - Nothing? - No. Well, how about-- I think I like this inspiration. [music playing] (SINGING) What it took you to prove, I guess that I owed you. It's nothing. The ones that can hurt you, the ones that can heal, I don't need your secondhand love to come and dry, dry these tears. Maybe it's nothing you want to hear. But for me, it's nothing I want to keep on feeling. I'm not the one who's with you tonight. I'm not the one. Well, I'm going to say goodnight. All right. You've got a lot of work ahead of you. Mm-hmm. They're going to love it, you know, the collection. You did a great job, James. Thank you. Thanks. So I'll see you tomorrow at the grand opening. Yeah, yeah, finally a chance for me to meet the mysterious Luc. You weren't going to introduce me, were you? Look, James. When the time is right, you'll meet him. I promise. He's going to love you. Goodnight. Goodnight. (SINGING) Kisses you're giving away, while they should be mine. They should be mine. They should be mine. Having trouble sleeping? How was your evening? HANNAH: Fine. You weren't waiting up for me now, were you? No, just catching up on some reading. At 2:00 AM, huh? Is it that late? So what are you reading? Luc, no offense, but you need a woman. [beeping] Or at least a hobby. [modem dialing up] What the hell's that? Nothing, I'm just checking on our next job. CANDICE (SEXILY): Hi. You've reached Candice's web page. I'm so very, very hot for you. So what's it going to be, big boy? HANNAH: So what have we got? Peter Wellington. Seems simple enough. Yeah, that's exactly what's got me worried. Luc, we can do this one in our sleep. Not this one. HANNAH: Hey, what are you doing? Hannah, trust me. This hit just isn't right. Luc, that was a lot of money. Doesn't that say anything to you? Now who pays a lot for easy contracts? The government, nothing in the contract is as easy as it seems. You don't think I can do this? Hannah, we don't do government jobs. It's that simple. Look. It's late. I'm tired, and I have no time for this. WOMAN (ON RADIO): We're coming down. Get the elevator. The car is on its way. [suspenseful music] Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm sorry. This is on service. You have to take another. Damn it, my daytimer. Alida. I'm on it, sir. Oh, come on. I'm only going to the fourth floor. It'll be our little secret. I know I'm going to regret this. Oh, damn. This is Alida. They got Wellington, a woman, south stairs. Move. [gunshot] Are you all right? Hannah? Yeah, yeah. Get the car. I'll take care of things here. Hannah, move. We're running out of time. [music playing] [elevator music] Got room for two more? Who sent you? The big, bad wolf. [shouting] [gunshot] Luc, Luc, no, no. No, no. No. It's OK. No. No, no, no, no, no. It's OK. No, you're gonna make it. You're gonna make it. No, please, don't. No. Luc, please. It's all my fault. No. You know what I was thinking? We need a calling card, yeah, something with style. All the great killers, they've got calling cards, something they say to a dude before they cap his ass. Now that's the kind of thing that gets you a rep. And when you get a killer rep, you get respect. Am I right? One problem. What? The guy's dead. So? Let me ask you this, Einstein. How can it be your "calling card" if there's no one around to tell the story? Let's go. You've got work to do. Name's Angel, and that's the last word you're ever gonna hear. Nah, that sucks. [knocking] Hey. Hey. So how was the opening? The opening was fine, Hannah. The opening was great. Thank you very much for being there. James. No, no, this is the same thing over and over again. I mean, it's getting absolutely ridiculous. Hannah, what's wrong? Why don't you sit down? What's wrong? He's dead, James. Oh, Hannah, I'm sorry. He's dead. I'm sorry. I was just at the cemetery now. How did this happen? Oh, I-- I-- I don't-- OK, all right, we don't have to talk about it. Why don't I, uh, why don't I go get us some food? And, uh, you just-- just-- just sit and relax for a minute, OK? OK. Uh, I could go get us a movie or something, say, um, uh, "The Princess Bride," with, uh, Billy Crystal, Robin Wright, uh, Andre the Giant. James, hurry back, OK? As you wish. [music playing] (SINGING) If you feel strange somehow, if you really want to know, it's been hard. Never been the creature. Never been the crowd. Never been the receiver of miracles when they're around, just the curiosity of healers. I've been touched. I've been bled. And it's still hard, so hard. Back up. [rock music] [shouting] [cracking] Hannah? No way, Hannah. You ain't seeing anyone, not now. Jesus Christ. Get out. What the hell are you? Why did you kill Luc? Who? A simple question, Alonzo, I want a simple answer. Who gave you my name? Your boy, Angel, for starters. Angel, that moron, I haven't used him for a month. He's freelance now. [non-english speech] Him and Franco have been working together for a while. We haven't seen those boys in a long time. Franco is a dead man. His life ain't worth the cost of a bullet. If anyone's using that joker for jobs, it's because they don't know him. So where do I find Franco? You can try the girls on East Side, low class. That's more his-- [groaning] I guarantee you, if he's making money, he'll be down there, pissing it away. Hey, baby, you look a little high strung. Why don't you let me loosen you up a little? Come over here. Sorry about your nose. It's the truth. I'm telling you. It's the truth. Good evening, Franco. Ah, fellas, are you guys, uh, looking for a little action? A little action? You know, uh, a little advice-- I'd, uh, lose the suits next time. It kind of makes you look like cops. A real joker, eh? Beat it. Take a hike. All right. It's time for a little chat, Franco. Yeah. [suspenseful music] So you kids want a drink? No, thanks. Kids. [music playing] I'll tell you, boys, music since the King died, man, crap. Now I'm not talking about when he was in Vegas, taking potshots at TVs and stuff. No, I'm talking about the man, oh, hey, in his prime. Are you two, uh, Elvis men? Sit down, Franco. Hey, relax. Now is it done? Where's my money? Jackson, the cash. I don't know what you guys were so worked up about. It was like fish in a barrel. You've always been clueless, Franco. I didn't know this was gonna be an official visit. Well, I just wanted to shake the hand of the man who killed two of the greatest assassins since Lee Harvey Oswald. FRANCO: Yeah, well, you want a job done right, you get the best. You just let me know if any more of your, uh, boys get out of line. So? So what? Are you gonna make me a happy man, Franco? I told you I could handle it. Luc's dead. The girl? Uh, we missed the, uh, op-- opportunity. Uh, look. It's no big deal. I sent Angel to take care of it. He should be back any time. You just relax. Have a drink. Don't worry. Anyway, she's a throw in, my gift to you, no charge. [chuckling] Did you hear that, fellas? The girl is a gift to us. Listen. I don't know what to say. You shouldn't have. And Moses, is he a gift as well? Well, no, I mean, a guy's gotta make a living, right? You guys understand that. Nice try, though. Do you ever ask yourself, Franco, how, uh, a screw up like you could get two of my best men? No. Because they were set up, Franco. They were sent there. I sent them there. And do you want to know why, Franco? I have a feeling you're going to tell me. Because they were loose ends, Franco. And you, you are my last. You know, it's almost criminal that this scumbag nailed Luc at Moses. Now all we have to do is find his little friend. Prep the place. Let's get out of here. This bunk is already starting to stink. What was that? The girl, sir. JAMES: Hey. What the hell are you doing here? What the hell am I doing here? I'm not the one sneaking into the back of my apartment. What the hell hap-- I mean, I come back. My place is trashed. You're gone. What am I supposed to think? James, not now. [tires squealing] What do you mean, not now? Jesus Christ, Hannah, would you talk to me. Freeze. Hands up against the wall, right now. Guys, it's not what you think. It's just a little disagreement. Hannah, you can tell them. You guys are good. Where did you come-- hey, Jesus. Hey, would you relax there, Serpico? James, are you OK? [distant emergency sirens] We gotta go. We gotta go. ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): For today, partly cloudy with a high around 40 degrees. You're listening to All News Radio. All news, all the time. We now take you live downtown to Senator Harmon's press conference, where as expected he announced his intentions to run as a presidential candidate-- JAMES: I don't feel well. Can you pull over? ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): In the upcoming election. We now join him live. Clearly, the deficit is not going to vanish overnight, folks. And, of course, vote for me. Let's try to keep a proper perspective on these things. I guarantee you, this whole thing will turn around. Vote for me. My budget proposal is just a starting point. Of course, vote for me. We work together and stay on course. All I ask for is that the American public be patient. And, of course, vote for me. I guarantee you. Of course, vote for me. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Martha, you are looking just exquisite. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. That'll be all the questions for today. Bye. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Where is the girl? We're working on it, sir. What did you say? Sir. I dare you to say that again. I don't need to remind you what it would mean if that girl were to see the light of day. You find her, and you finish her. Are you going to kill me now, too? James, take a look at this gun. Look at it. It doesn't have a serial number on it. James, they weren't cops. Jesus Christ, is that supposed to make it easier? James, I-- You-- you're what? You're sorry that I just killed somebody? What-- what-- what the hell happened back there? You're like-- you're like Jackie Chan or something. I mean, who are you? I don't even know. James, this was an assassin, a paid killer. And so am I. I never knew my mother because she died in a car crash when I was really young. Luc was my father's best friend in the war. And before he died, he made him promise to take care of me. You know what? I don't want to hear it. James. Hey, you two OK? Yes, sir. I was just, uh, feeling a little carsick. Is that so? Where you two kids from? The city. You don't say? What might be your business in these parts? Just passing through. Passing through, huh? How about some ID? You all have that in the big city, don't you? It's, uh, in the car. Now if I were to punch up your license plate here, I wouldn't find out your names are Bonnie and Clyde, something like that, now would I? What the-- Whoa, whoa, wait a second. Officer, it's not what you think. No? And you tell me, just what am I thinking? Hannah, hold on here. Drop it, lady. Put it down. I said, put it down. Everybody just chill, OK? Take a moment here. Put it down. No way, lady, not gonna happen. Look, Of-- Officer Wiley, listen, Officer Wiley. Clarence. What? Everybody calls me Clarence. No one calls me Officer Wiley. OK, look, Clarence. You don't want to get shot, do you? Neither do I. So, please, put the gun down. How come you're not asking her to put the gun down. Because I've got a pretty good feeling about you, Clarence. You seem like a pretty sensible guy to me. Her? Oh, Jesus. Clarence, do you have any kids? Look at me. I asked if you had any kids. Yeah, two. Just think about your kids, Clarence. Hey, they deserve to have their father around. Take it easy, man. I'm just gonna take this. Everything is gonna be cool, OK? I promise you, no one's going to get hurt. It's OK. It's OK. See? We're all friends here. What are you gonna do with me? OK, now, Clarence, I'm just going to leave your keys by the front tire, all right? Are you OK? You're not too, uh, cold are you? OK. What about the radio? What's that? Can I listen to the radio? Sure, Clarence. [music playing] MUSICIAN (ON RADIO): (SINGING) I hear that lonesome train rolling. You take it easy. MUSICIAN (ON RADIO): (SINGING) I'm looking for my baby. Don't know when he's coming back. We make a pretty good team, huh? James, I know this is a lot to swallow. Christ, I know how twisted this all sounds. But you don't understand. I have to find them before they find us. And then what? Then that's it. It's over. It's just-- look. I understand if you want to leave. Where to? What? Where to next? MUSICIAN (ON RADIO): (SINGING) The fame never found him. Fortune never shined. If he hadn't left me, I would not have found mine. Lonesome train, lonesome train, lonesome train, lonesome train. Lonesome train, lonesome train, lonesome train, lonesome train. Ozzy, Ozzy. Hello, beautiful. Who's Ozzy? He's like family. I've known him since I was a little girl. He's taking care of the boat here for the winter. Are you a sight for sore eyes? Oh, it's good to see you. You're all right. This is James. Hey, Ozzy. What brings you to this lovely corner of the world? Ozz, we're in trouble. Yeah, what else is new? Oh, baby, what you got here, girl? I think they're feds. Ozz, I don't know what the hell's going on here. Are you OK? Ozz, Luc's dead. What happened? The last hit, we were set up. Look. Ozz, do you think we could go in and clean up? It's been a really long day. Of course. But let me borrow the kid here. I can use some help with your friends in the trunk. Hannah, I'm sorry. Thanks, Ozz. What are you gonna do with me? So, kid, what's your story? There's not much to tell, really. Frustrated artist, tired of being told he-- he'll never make it, wakes up one morning and finally believes it. So he takes a job in a small but funky gallery downtown and spends his days hanging other people's dreams on the walls. Not much of a headline. So what the hell are we doing now, Ozz? I don't think it would be in my best interest to drive around town in a stolen vehicle with two bodies in the trunk. So we gotta move bodies now? Great, just great. So, James, what are your intentions with Hannah? Don't worry. I'll have her home by midnight. How long have you two known each other? All her life. God, it seems just like yesterday she was just a little girl. She was brought up by her grandparents, and then Luc. What was he like? Who, Luc? Yeah. He was one of the best friends a guy could have. I met him in 'Nam. We were in the same unit, for a while, before he joined a team of special ops. Thing was, when they asked him to join, they didn't mention what he had to give up. You see, what these guys would do was secret. I mean, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you, see. Nobody could know where he was or what he was doing. So they reported him MIA, intercepted all his mail going both ways. He never even knew he had a baby girl waiting for him when he came back. He never even knew his sweetheart had been killed in a car accident. Jesus. So Luc was-- man, why are you telling me all this? You're all she's got. Her family life hasn't exactly been a bed of roses. I'm not trying to make excuses for her, just trying to give you a little insight. We'd better get this car back. Come on, kid. The legend goes that the blues is the devil's music. The crossroads, that's where you're supposed to meet the devil to get the 12th tune. Is this some sort of bonding thing? It seems our friend here had never heard of Robert Johnson. He probably thought the blues began and ended with Stevie Ray Vaughan. Ozzy gets a little testy when it comes to the blues. He thinks he knows everything under the sun. How many albums you got now, Ozz? 2,000 and counting, on vinyl, like they were meant to be, none of this compact crap. Yeah, I gotta agree with you there, Ozz. I mean, you ever seen the compact version of "Sticky Fingers?" It kind of defeats the purpose. Andy Warhol did that. I'm aware. Hey, Ozz, what's this? Goddamn, I am a handsome man. Is that Luc? No, Bob Rio, that's Luc. This guy here is Keith Kurtz. We used to call him Moses on account of him being so religious. We started with Holy Moses. Moses? Yeah, Moses, the guy was a real Bible thumper. Tell me more about Moses. That's him there. He joined our platoon about two-- What's wrong, Hannah? Moses, the guy who killed Luc mentioned a Moses. What was that first guy's name again? Bob Rio? Bob Rio, no, I-- I don't remember that name. You know, I remember this, saying goodbye. These three, Rio, Luc, and Moses, were being transferred. It's the last time I saw them in the country. Why them? They were the snipers in our battalion. Black ops. What? It's, uh, it's what Ozzy told me, a special unit in Vietnam. Jesus. Guns with no serial numbers, black operations, Ozzy, what the hell have we gotten ourselves into here? Is anyone else hungry? I'm starved. There's a burger place just a few miles down on the right. Take my car. The keys are in it. All right, I'm on it. What did you tell him? What he needs to know. He's a good kid. Yeah, he is. He's a big boy. He can take care of himself. Look, Ozz, I'm really tired. It's been a hell of a day. I'm gonna go lie down. OK, baby, get your rest. Thanks, Ozz. Sir. Sir, we have no word from Reynolds and Jackson. We've been trying to trace them, but we've come up empty handed. And what about the girl? Have you been able to track her down? She seems to have disappeared as well. Let me get this straight. You have access to state of the art tracking devices, satellites, computers, and you can't even find two of your own field agents? Yes, sir. OK, I'll tell you what. Why don't you get the hell out of here? And if you value your life, even a little bit, you'll find that girl. - Yes, sir. So van Gogh cut his ear off, and then he mailed it to her. Why? He was a tortured artist. He-- he, uh, was deeply in love, you know? Um, and he was quite insane. That's besides the point. Hey, sunshine. What time is it? How long have I been out? A couple hours, it feels like a couple days, though. The kid here has been talking my ear off. You like that one? Talking my ear off. Yeah, that's a good one. OZZY: You OK, darling? Yeah, I'm fine. So tell me more about the black ops. There's nothing to tell, really, just rumors, assassination-type stuff. They were real cloak and dagger. They had their own agenda, and they didn't discriminate, if you know what I mean. Charming. So who would want them dead, and why? I think the question you should be asking is not why, but why now? Luc knew he was living on borrowed time. They all did. So how do I find out more about the black ops? Maybe they've got a website. Newman. GEORGE (ON PHONE): Yeah, this is, uh, George Henderson from the, um, Lidon County Police Department. What is it? GEORGE (ON PHONE): Hey, are you driving right now? You know you're not supposed to talk on the phone and drive, right? You'd better pull over if you want to continue this conversation. What the hell do you want? GEORGE (ON PHONE): Hey, there's no need to get testy with me, sir. We've got that information you requested. You were looking for two men and a-- Get on with it. Well, it seems one of our boys found that car a few hours ago. And, well, I hope you're sitting down. [tires squealing] [honking] I think I can get Luc's email from here. Bingo, here it comes. What are we looking for? This. This was sent to Luc the same day we were set up. JAMES: It's a freakin' nursery rhyme. The answer's got to be here somewhere. Wait a second. Go back. That's not how it goes. What? The rhyme, it's been changed. HANNAH: This isn't a message. This is a warning. Someone was trying to warn Luc. Damn it. I've got to find out who sent this. You can check the code, the computer code, here. You can trace the, uh, the email using the graphic code. Voila. This could take some time. Look, James. I'm going to get our room ready. You let me know the second anything comes up, OK? Kensington Public School. Sorry? The message, it came from, uh, Kensington Public School. It's, uh, it's in a little town about an hour north of here. Well, at least we have a destination, huh? I-- I don't suppose there's any merit in telling you how insane this is? I mean, you have considered the possibility that this is, you know, another set up, right? I'm just tired of running. You're not used to running. I, uh, took the liberty of drawing us a map. Look, James, when this is over-- When this is over, I-- I'm, uh, going to take you out of this two-bit, one-horse town. See the world firsthand, Sistine Chapel, Mona Lisa. The Statue of David? Of course, she wants to see the naked man. James, I don't deserve you. That is true. Come on. Talk dirty to me. [sighing] Looking for these? Busted. So what do you want me to tell him? Tell him I'll be home soon. You be careful. Always. I'll-- I'll check with Chang. Hold on for a second, dear. What is it? We just got word from the sheriff that ID'd the girl. Where? She and her companion overpowered him at the junction of I-5 and Highway 89. I've got to go, honey. I'll talk to you later, OK? Bye. Sir, there's still no word from Reynolds and Jackson. Jane, did you get my dry cleaning? JANE (ON PHONE): Yes, sir, picked it up on Thursday. OK, send out two teams. I'm sure they couldn't have gotten far. Yes, sir. Sir? We'll take my car. [blues music] Hey, Ozz. That smells good, man. What are you cooking? Eggs, bacon, and a little blues. It's the breakfast of champions. That's right. So where is, uh, where is Hannah? Oh, come on. She didn't-- She can take care of herself. Are you insane? I've got to go after her. What you got to do is sit your ass down and eat these goddamn eggs. Now sit down. Sit. Besides, she took the car. Son, I'm gonna introduce you to my special recipe, Ozzy's eggs tequila. You don't recognize me. Do you, Hannah? We can't talk here. Who are you? How did you find me? Answer the question. I knew Luc. My name's Bob, Bob Rio. You sent the email, didn't you, three little pigs? Remember, one got away. They'll find you, Bob. I did. They can't find what they're not looking for. 15 years ago, a chopper went down over Nicaragua. All hands, bodies were never recovered. It never appeared in the news because it never officially happened. You were on that flight, weren't you? Brilliant, eh? I killed me before they could. How did you know that they were going to kill Luc? I knew as soon as I saw that. Boy, if I have learned anything in my 55 years on God's green Earth, it is not to try to understand the mind of a woman. Amen. You can't live with them. And you can't shoot them. I beg to differ. They got Luc? What about Moses? Did they get him, too? Dead. Prince of lies, El Diablo, the devil himself. Senator Harmon. After what we did, Luc should have known Harmon was gonna come knocking. Bob, what did you do? Tell me. I'm not gonna ask you again. Only the most notorious assassination of all time. Hey, Sherlock, next time park your car in the back. Look. That's it. I'm definitely not voting Republican now. Gentlemen, I'm a busy man. I have a dinner engagement with the Speaker of the House and a late-night interview with City Line. And my little baby girl can't get to sleep without me reading her a bedtime story. So as you can see, I'm a little pressed for time. Where did she go? Come on, Bob. We're going on a little trip. No way, lady, I ain't going anywhere. Bob, this is bigger than the both of us. People need to know. Now that's crap. Nobody's gonna believe us. That's what keeps them safe. Look, Bob. Why did you try and get in touch with Luc? I told you, to warn him. He didn't need warning. Tell me the real reason, Bob. It's because you can't stay out of the game, right? Here you are, in the middle of nowhere. Harmon thinks you're dead. You've won, but you risk everything to warn somebody who doesn't need it. Am I right? Helping Luc was just one last little screw you to get to Harmon. Come on, Bob. Let's get personal. You know Harmon well. What's that supposed to mean? Once he finds out you're alive, he will travel to the ends of the Earth to find you. The way I see it, we've got one chance. We find him first. Where did she go? Well, then, um, when is she coming back? [gunshot] You bastard. Now do I have your attention? What are you protecting her for? What did she ever do for you, except get you mixed up in all of this? I didn't kill Ozzy. Your girlfriend did. That's how you've got to look at it. You know, my girlfriend's gonna kick your ass. Oh, thank you for telling me what I need to know. Newman, go rig the ship. We can't afford to take any chances, since his girlfriend's coming back to kick my ass. Yes, sir. [beeping] I know. I know. Isn't that insane? Not the phone company, that's way too obvious. Who invented the internet? I'll tell you who it was, the government. Why? Global village, information sharing, I think not. I'll tell you who you're sharing information with. And you invited them into your home. What is it? What's wrong? [inaudible] BOB: So? Something's not right here, Bob. BOB: Harmon. You're OK, kid. Too bad you're not batting on the winning team. But then, uh, you're not a player, are you? You're an artist. I'm a bit of an artist myself. Do you know what I like to do? I like to finger paint. When is she coming back? Well, have faith, kid. Didn't Matisse paint with his mouth at the end of his career when he could no longer use his hands? Sir, you're not gonna believe this. SNIPER (ON RADIO): Target has returned. Want me to take her out? No. No, hold your fire. You gave your girlfriend too much credit. She's coming straight to us. Williams, get the girl. Phillips, you hold your position. SNIPER (ON RADIO): Roger that. This ought to be interesting. Let's go, Picasso. It's game time. She's clean. Thanks for making it so easy. James, are you OK? JAMES: I'm OK. Let him go, Harmon. He has nothing to do with this. Oh, no, no, no, your artist friend is a featured player, thanks to you. Why, Harmon? Why now? Well, that's the million-dollar question, isn't it? You see, Hannah, the world is not black and white. There are no more walls, no more clear enemies. Me, I'm just changing with the times, adapting, if you will. For that, I need a-- HANNAH: Clean slate. Give the girl a prize. You see, I'm the new enemy, the one you can't find, even though he's standing right in front of you. I have power, Hannah, but not the kind of power that comes with the backing of the American public. I've started wars. But like my daddy used to say, don't start things you can't finish. One day when I'm president, I'll have the power to finish them. You're insane. No, no, no, no, no, I'm opportunistic. The ship's rigged to blow, Hannah. Well, that's too bad, just when things were getting interesting, too. Cut the crap, Harmon time to lay the cards on the table. I've got Bob, Bob Rio. But Bob Rio is-- HANNAH: Dead, I know, died in a helicopter crash in Nicaragua? You've just got to ask yourself how I know. What's the matter, Harmon? You don't look too good. The one man who can bring your house of cards crashing down loose on the town. How do I know you have Bob Rio? That's the question on everyone's mind. [gunshot] Two down, three to go. Sorry, honey. My day is done. I'm gonna need some cover. Can you manage? I ain't dead yet. On three, ready? One, two, three. Looks like you're stuck with me. No, you're stuck with me. 15 in the mag, one in the pipe, you take him. I'm going down. [distant gunfire] [chuckling] Nowhere to run, Senator. All your men are dead. The game is over. Honey, I haven't even begun. Come on, Senator. Stick your head out just a little. I guess it's time to show who's in charge, huh? You know, raise the stakes a little, huh? [cry of pain] Come on, kid. What are your options? Let's examine them together, shall we? Now we can stand here and chat all day while your friend here bleeds to death. I mean, I'm no expert, but it looks pretty bad. Or you can take your shot, kill him quick, and then I'm yours. What's it gonna be, little girl? The clock is ticking. - Do it. - Come on. Do it, kid. Take your shot. Come on. - Do it. Come on. Come on. Go for it. JAMES: Shoot him now, Hannah. SENATOR HARMON: Do it. Woo, can't you feel the rush? Kill this prick now, Hannah. SENATOR HARMON: Take the shot. Come on, Hannah. Oh, damn. See, now, surrendering was never an option. Are you OK? I'm OK. I wasn't kidding about the ship being wired, Hannah. You might want to get it in gear. Damn it. Hannah. Hannah, ease up. It's over. Remind me never to piss you off. Gosh, you know, I miss him already. So where to? Anywhere, clean slate. No more secrets? No more secrets. I got just one. I collect comic books. You know, I think I want to draw them. No, I'm not kidding. I've got this one idea for this-- this character, see? She's a, uh, she's an assassin. - Oh, no. - Yeah, I know. She works undercover. And her boyfriend, he's this kickass Kung Fu expert. The comic's really more about him. Oh. (SINGING) I remember a summer's day. I went to ride an airplane. Want to be my brother? Pilot's just what we wanted to be. And Mama took the time and paid attention to our dreams. Now we're driving the 401. And Steely's on the radio, and we're smoking and laughing. The great escape, look at what we've shown. [inaudible] summer morning with TV, get some sun. It's the sunlight shining. And case in point, you're smiling for that one fine feeling that comes with these, won't let you go. Waves are breaking. Sails are full. And growing up Canadian, well, it makes you stronger. Abandon ship, eight hands in the cooler. Well, keeping with tradition, murdered fish for fuel. Tempted by glamor, dead by flesh. Foundation keeps a-growing. So we keep it solid 'cause candy coatings crack and lose their flavor, like '60s architecture. Nothing much to say, boy. It's the sunlight shining in. And case in point, you're smiling for that one fine feeling that comes with these, won't let you go.
