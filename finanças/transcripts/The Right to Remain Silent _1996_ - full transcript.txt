Woman: YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT. IF YOU GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT, ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SPEAK WITH AN ATTORNEY AND HAVE THE ATTORNEY PRESENT DURING QUESTIONING. ( voices overlapping speaking Miranda rights ) ( radio chatter ) ( tires screeching ) ( radio chatter, sirens ) ( sirens ) DO YOU UNDERSTAND EACH OF THESE RIGHTS I'VE EXPLAINED TO YOU? DO YOU WISH TO GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT? ( shouting, clamoring ) ALL RIGHT! STICK THESE GUYS IN THREE AND THOSE GUYS IN FIVE. GET THE HOOD OFF THAT CLOWN! WHERE THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING? JEW BOYS, SLANT EYES, BUTT PIRATES, BEAN EATERS, SPOOKS, QUEERS... ( yelling continues ) DAMN IT, ROOKIE, HELP ME. I'M NOT DANCING WITH THIS SON OF A BITCH! ( silence ) HE'S A NIGGER! YOU UNCLE TOM TRAITOR! YOU ALL JUST PROVED MY POINT. ( shouting resumes ) LOOK, THOSE PEOPLE ARE FUCKIN' CRAZY! WHAT, AND YOU'RE NOT? I KNEW THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR A SCUFFLE; I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO GET AS VIOLENT AS IT DID. WHY DO WE ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE WHEN VIOLENCE IS THE INEVITABLE OUTCOME? WHAT ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT? SHUT UP! SO MUCH FOR THE FIRST AMENDMENT. THANK YOU. LOOK, I'M SORRY. BUT I DON'T THINK OUR FOREFATHERS WROTE THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF BIGOTRY. COME ON. LET'S GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE. COME ON. LET'S GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE. BY THE WAY, I WANT MY CAMERA BACK. I'M DOIN' A DOCUMENTARY ON THE KLAN; I GOT SOME INCREDIBLE FOOTAGE OUT THERE TODAY. I WISH I HAD IT ON ME WHEN THEY SAW MY FACE. YOU'RE LUCKY YOU GOT A FACE. WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU TRYIN' TO DO? TRYIN' TO SHOW EVERYONE HOW DANGEROUS THESE PEOPLE ARE. THOUGHT DOCUMENTARIES WERE SUPPOSED TO BE UNBIASED. HERE, STOW THE FIREARMS. IT'S KINDA HARD TO BE UNBIASED WHEN YOU'VE SEEN THE THINGS I'VE SEEN. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME AROUND THESE PEOPLE, STUDYING THEM. IT'S NOT ONLY IN THE DEEP SOUTH, YOU KNOW. IT'S EVERYWHERE. PITTSBURGH, PORTLAND, PHOENIX. EVERYWHERE YOU GO, THEY'RE THERE, FESTERING. SO I WENT UNDERCOVER, LITERALLY, TO PROVE A POINT. A SHEET, A SHEET I BOUGHT AT A STORE. FOR 12.95, I BECAME A CARD-CARRYING MEMBER OF THE INVISIBLE EMPIRE. OKAY. OPEN UP. WHO ARE YOU? CHARLES A. TAYLOR. MY FRIENDS CALL ME RED. WHAT'S WITH THE CAMERA? I'M DOIN' A PROMOTIONAL FILM FOR THE KKK. I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT TIME THE WORLD GOT TO SEE THE REAL US. CAN I BE IN IT? JUST STAND RIGHT THERE. NOW JUST SPEAK FROM YOUR HEART. WAKE UP, WHITE PEOPLE. NOW THAT NIGGER APPRECIATION MONTH IS OVER, WE CAN ALL GET ON WITH THE REST OF OUR LIVES. BE PROUD OF WHO YOU ARE, AND WHAT YOU ARE... WHITE AND AMERICAN. OKAY, THAT'S IT. HEY, DAVE, I'M GONNA BE IN A MOVIE. THE FACT THAT I COULD WALK AMONGST THEM PROVES HOW STUPID THEY ARE. WHAT DO WE GOT HERE? DISTURBING THE PEACE. DO I LOOK LIKE A RED TO YOU? NOT EXACTLY. THEY'RE ALL SO STUPID. I JUST TELL THEM THIS IS AN OFFICIAL INSIGNIA FROM A SECT IN NORTHERN GEORGIA, AND THE DUMB IDIOTS BUY IT. DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY? NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S FUNNY WHEN PEOPLE GET HURT. I DON'T EITHER; THAT'S WHY I'M MAKIN' THIS FILM. MAYBE PEOPLE WILL SEE IT AND BAND TOGETHER AND PUT A STOP TO THIS. WHEN YOU COMBINE IGNORANCE WITH HATRED, YOU GOT DYNAMITE WAITIN' TO EXPLODE. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO STARTED ALL THIS, DIDN'T YOU? I'M GONNA BE IN A MOVIE. DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT AS TO WHAT HE JUST SAID? HE SAID, GET THAT CAMERA OFF ME. YOU TRYIN' TO GET ME ON TAPE SO LATER ON, YOU CAN TERRORIZE MY FAMILY? YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. GET THAT CAMERA OFF ME! GET YOUR HANDS OFF RED, MONKEY BOY. MONKEY THIS, MOTHERFUCKER. GIVE ME THAT CAMERA. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! HE WAS DEAF WITH ANGER. GIVE ME YOUR RIGHT HAND, PLEASE. AS LONG AS NO ONE LISTENS, WE'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO LIVE TOGETHER. Officer: THIS IS AN ILLEGAL GATHERING. GO BACK TO YOUR HOMES. YOU ARE DISTURBING THE PEACE. I NEVER MEANT FOR ANYONE TO GET HURT, BUT I'M TELLING YOU, WHAT I'M DOING IS IMPORTANT. THE ROAD TO HELL IS LINED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS. OVER THERE. TOES ON THE LINE. PUT YOUR HANDS OUT WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM. PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE HOOD OF THE CAR AND DON'T MOVE. YOU ARE UNDER ARREST. LOOK, IF IT WASN'T ME, IT WOULD'VE BEEN SOMEBODY ELSE. YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THESE PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY? YES. THIS HAPPEN IN EVERY CITY? NO. SO THE FIRST RIOT YOU GET INVOLVED IN, YOU STARTED IT. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO STARTS IT; THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ALWAYS THERE. I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THE KLAN EITHER, BUT I THINK YOU JUST LOWERED YOURSELF TO THEIR LEVEL. YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE THINGS I'VE SEEN. I'VE BEEN A COP FOR 35 YEARS. I'VE SEEN JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ANYBODY CAN IMAGINE. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN YOUR GRANDFATHER HANGIN' ON THE END OF A ROPE WHEN YOU WERE SIX YEARS OLD? YOU GOT OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT, ROOKIE. PALEY, SIR. CHRISTINE PALEY. YOU'RE NOT PLANNING ON BEING TEN MINUTES LATE EVERY DAY, ARE YOU? SIR, ACTUALLY, I WAS REALLY NOT... WHO YOU GOT IN THE POOL? CINCINNATI. I GOT SAN FRANCISCO. SAN FRANCISCO? WHO THE HELL DID YOU PAY OFF? DORIS. LIEUTENANT BROSLOE, I... WHAT WAS YOUR NAME AGAIN? PALEY, SIR. CHRISTINE PALEY. YEAH, PALEY. WHY WERE YOU TEN MINUTES LATE? SIR, I WANTED TO EXPLAIN. DORIS, THIS STACK IS READY FOR FILING. TAKE THEM AWAY. YES, SIR. WELL, LOOK AT THAT. TOP OF MY DESK; I HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN WEEKS. WELL, NOW, WHERE ARE THE DOUGHNUTS? SIR? THE DOUGHNUTS. SIR, UM... LISTEN TO THIS. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. EVERY SHIFT BEGINS WITH DOUGHNUTS. DOUGHNUTS ARE A MUST. DIDN'T YOU READ THAT RULE IN THE MANUAL? SIR, I SCORED A 98% ON MY WRITTEN EXAM, I KNOW THE MANUAL LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND, AND THERE IS NO SUCH RULE. WELL, THERE SHOULD BE. YOU'RE THE ROOKIE, IT'S YOUR JOB TO BRING IN THE DOUGHNUTS. BUT, SIR... I DON'T EVEN EAT DOUGHNUTS. UH-OH, DORIS, WE GOT ANOTHER HEALTH NUT ON OUR HANDS. WHAT DO YOU EAT WITH A CUP OF JOE? HOLD IT A SECOND. LET ME THINK. I'LL BET IT'S A BRAN MUFFIN OF SOME SORT. WELL, ACTUALLY, I DO LIKE BRAN MUFFINS. YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW, IF YOU EAT TOO MUCH BRAN, YOU SPEND HALF YOUR SHIFT IN THE TOILET. WE NEED YOU HERE ON THE FLOOR, AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES. I'M GONNA LET YOUR BUTT SLIDE ON THIS DOUGHNUT THING, BUT PLEASE, DON'T LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN. BY THE WAY, I LOVE CHOCOLATE DOUGHNUTS WITH THOSE LITTLE CRUNCHY NUTS ON THEM. HOLD THE SPRINKLES, I HATE SPRINKLES. EXCUSE ME, SIR, BUT DID YOU SAY I'D BE ON THE FLOOR, BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT-- I'VE GOT A NEW REPORT, AND HODGE CALLED IN SICK. THAT'S FOUR FOR TONIGHT. HOLY MOSES. EVERYBODY'S GETTIN' HIT WITH THE FLU BUG. SO, WHERE WERE WE? OH, YEAH. YEAH, YEAH. YOU FANCIED YOURSELF IN A BLACK AND WHITE. WONDER WOMAN SHOWED UP, AND SHE NEEDS TO SAVE METROPOLIS. NO, SIR. I JUST WAS HOPING-- FACT IS, I GOT NO TRAINING OFFICERS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW. THEY'VE ALL BEEN LOANED OUT TO THE 12th. WE GOT FOUR OFFICERS OUT WITH THE FLU, SO SORRY TO INFORM YOU THAT YOUR ASS IS MINE FROM 10:00 P.M. TO 6:00 A.M. THAT'S JUST A FIGURE OF SPEECH, SO DON'T START THINKIN' SEXUAL HARASSMENT. SIR, I WAS JUST KIND OF ANXIOUS TO GET OUT ON THE STREETS, AND THAT IS STANDARD PROCEDURE. STANDARD OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE LOOKS GOOD ON THE PAGE AT THE ACADEMY, BUT IT AIN'T WORTH A COLD POT OF PISS HERE ON THE JOB. I UNDERSTAND, SIR. I GUESS I'M JUST DISAPPOINTED. WHY? YOU THINK BEING IN THE STATION HOUSE IS GOING TO BE BORING? NOT EXACTLY. TRUST ME, IT WON'T. NOW I'M GOING TO NEED YOU IN PROCESSING, AND IRREGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE AT THE ACADEMY, IT IS GOING TO BE ANYTHING BUT BORING. REGARDLESS. EXCUSE ME. IT'S REGARDLESS. IT'S NOT IRREGARDLESS. IRREGARDLESS ISN'T CORRECT. IT'S A DOUBLE NEGATIVE. OH... AHEM, TOM HARRIS, D.U.I., JUST BROUGHT IN. THANK YOU, DORIS. GOOD LUCK. WOULD YOU MIND GETTING OVER TO PROCESSING AND TAKE CARE OF THIS? YES, SIR. IS THERE A PROBLEM? WHERE IS PROCESSING, SIR? WE WERE JUST THERE. I'M JUST A LITTLE TURNED AROUND. ( chuckles ) I TELL YOU WHAT. YOU GO OUT THAT DOOR, YOU HANG A LEFT, AND THEN, IF YOU GET LOST, YOU JUST ASK ANYBODY THAT'S WEARING THE SAME UNIFORM YOU'RE WEARING. YES, SIR. DORIS, IRREGARDLESS OF WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED, COULD YOU GET SOMEONE TO GET THE GODDAMN DOUGHNUTS?! I ALREADY HAVE. NO, NO, I'M OKAY. I FEEL FINE. NO, THIS GUY JUST WENT OFF ON ME. IT SHOULD BE OKAY. I KNOW. NO. ( clears throat ) HI. HI. NO, I GOTTA GO. OKAY, BYE. I THINK THIS IS MY DESK. I'M SORRY. HERE. PLEASE. HERE, PLEASE. SIT DOWN. I'M SORRY, BUT AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW YOU? NO. CAN I BE HONEST WITH YOU? YEAH. I DID DRINK A LITTLE BIT TONIGHT, BUT NOT ENOUGH FOR ME TO BE HERE. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. WHAT AM I, LIKE A HALF DECIMAL POINT OFF? HMM? I'M FINE. SEE? MR. HARRIS. YES. PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. OFFICER... PALEY? THE REASON I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD WAS TO PROTECT THE ANIMALS. YEAH, I KNOW IT SOUNDS STRANGE, BUT JUST HEAR ME OUT, OKAY? YOU SEE, WHERE I LIVE, THERE ARE A LOT OF TREES ON EACH SIDE OF THE ROAD, AND AT NIGHT, ANIMALS COME SHOOTING OUT ALL THE TIME. THE ROAD, AND AT NIGHT, ANIMALS COME SHOOTING OUT ALL THE TIME. SPLAT. I HIT A DEER. IT COULD'VE BEEN WORSE. THE LAST THING I NEED IS VARMINT GUTS ALL OVER MY CAR. BESIDES, I'M AN ANIMAL LOVER. SO INSTEAD OF DRIVING ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, I ALWAYS DRIVE DOWN THE MIDDLE SO I CAN SEE BETTER PERIPHERY. PERIPHERALLY. YEAH, WHATEVER. THAT WAY, I HAVE MORE TIME TO REACT. THAT'S WHY I DID IT. THAT'S THE TRUTH. THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE RIGHT NOW AND NOT AT HOME IS BECAUSE OF THE OTHER COP. COME ON. HE DOESN'T THINK I KNOW THE ALPHABET. THAT'S BULLSHIT. I'LL TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW. A, B, C, D... E, F, H, I... ( kids laughing ) J, K... ( stammers ) ( crashing sound ) MR. HARRIS, DO YOU KNOW YOUR ALPHABET? YES OR NO? YES. HE WOULDN'T LET ME SING IT. Children: ♪ A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V... ♪ W, X, Y, AND Z. ♪ NOW I KNOW MY ABC's, TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF ME ♪ ( chuckles quietly ) THAT'S HOW I LEARNED THE ALPHABET. BY SINGING IT. NOT SAYING IT. WHO THE HELL CAN SAY IT? I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE. I OWN MY OWN BUSINESS. AND I KNOW THE FUCKING ALPHABET. I'M SORRY. IT'S ABSURD. INSTEAD OF GOING OUT AND CONVICTING THE RAPISTS, AND THE DRUG DEALERS AND THE MURDERERS, YOU'VE GOT A GUY HERE WHO CAN'T SAY HIS FRIGGIN' ALPHABET. OH, WHAT A CRIME. THEY SHOULD LOCK ME UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY, DON'T YOU THINK? JUST CAME OVER THE WIRE. BOOK HIM ON A 454. WHAT? WHAT? SO? I MADE A LITTLE MISTAKE. I'M HUMAN. I'M JUST LIKE YOU. DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE? ( horn honks ) ( brakes screeching, cars colliding ) ( woman sobbing ) ( sirens blaring ) Woman: OH, MY GOD. PLEASE HELP ME. PLEASE. MR. HARRIS, DO YOU KNOW YOUR ALPHABET, YES OR NO? YES. Woman: DEBBIE! Paramedic: ALL RIGHT. WE'RE LOSING HER. COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, LET'S MOVE. WE NEED CPR HERE. CAN YOU GET ON HER? GO. ( woman continues sobbing and screaming ) ( woman continues sobbing and screaming ) THE LITTLE GIRL. YES. ( sound of cars crashing ) OH, GOD. ( sound of cars crashing ) OH, GOD. I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT. YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME. I HARDLY EVER DRINK. SORRY. ( whispers ) I'M SORRY. ( sobs ) LOOK OUT, LOOK OUT. GET IT. ( gunshot ) SELF-DEFENSE, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. SELF-DEFENSE. CHRIST, YOU DELIVER A FEW PIZZAS IN MY AREA, AND YOU'LL SEE IT'S A DANGEROUS JOB. GRANTED, IT'S NOT COMPANY POLICY TO CARRY A GUN... HEY, ROOKIE, TAKE THIS ONE OFF MY HANDS, WILL YA? SHE'S READY TO GO. MUGGING WHEN DELIVERING PIZZA IS BECOMING A COMMON THING. PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT. DO YOU KNOW WHY THE DRIVERS CARRY 19.99? IT'S ON THE BOX. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. CHECK IT OUT NEXT TIME YOU ORDER A PIZZA. YOU'LL SEE. IT'S RIGHT ON THE BOX. I NEVER HAD A PIZZA BEFORE. GOD, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU EAT? YOU DON'T EAT PIZZA? THAT'S A BUNCH OF B.S. YOU MUST COME FROM A DIFFERENT PLANET. EVERYBODY HAS A PIZZA. GOTTA GET YOUR PRINTS AND PICS. I WOULDN'T WASTE ANY FILM ON ME; I'M ONLY GONNA END UP IN THE CIRCULAR FILE ANYHOW. I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE ABOUT THAT. BULL. I KNOW I'M RIGHT. HI. OFFICER PALEY IN PROCESSING. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ON THIS... WHAT'S YOUR NAME? PAULINA MARCOS. PAULINA MARCOS. THANK YOU. THIS WAY. YOU KNOW, IT'S A FUNNY THING. WHEN I FIRST TOOK THIS JOB, I USED TO BE EMBARRASSED TO TALK ABOUT IT TO ANYONE. IT'S KIND OF THE END OF THE ROPE TYPE OF JOB. AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT I USED TO THINK. I'M NOT PLANNING TO MAKE A CAREER OUT OF THIS. BUT THE WAY THINGS ARE RIGHT NOW, IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING. UNEMPLOYMENT JUST DON'T CUT IT. YOU TRY LIVING ON 210 BUCKS A WEEK, MAN. YOU KNOW? IT'S HARD. SO FINALLY, I JUST HAD TO TAKE WHAT I COULD GET, YOU KNOW, SO HERE I AM, PIZZA GIRL. IT'S ODD, THOUGH. AFTER WORKING THERE FOR A WHILE, I'VE QUIT BEING EMBARRASSED, BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE MAKING AN HONEST-TO-GOD LIVING. LUIS MARTINEZ, HE'S GOT A KID IN PRE-MED, AND I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR THAT. I MEAN, IN MY OPINION, AND I CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE I USED TO BE ONE OF THESE PEOPLE WHO USED TO TURN DOWN THEIR NOSE AT 'EM WHEN I WAS AT COLLEGE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY'RE GETTIN' BY... OH, OH. I CAN TAKE CARE OF IT. I'M GONNA WASH THIS ANYWAY. AND THEY'RE NOT BITCHIN' ABOUT IT, AND BELIEVE ME, THERE'S PLENTY TO BITCH ABOUT. I DON'T DOUBT IT. COME ON, I HAVE TO GET A PICTURE. YOU KNOW, YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THE NUMBER OF NAKED PEOPLE I HAVE TO SEE IN THIS BUSINESS. AND DARN IT, NONE OF THEM ARE ANYTHING LIKE BRAD PITT. I REMEMBER THIS ONE TIME WHEN I WAS TAKING THIS MEDIUM SAUSAGE TO THIS TOOTHLESS, BULBOUS, FAT PERVERT OVER ON FARMINGTON. HE COMES TO THE DOOR DRESSED IN THIS RED KIMONO THAT HAD LIONS, YELLOW, ALL OVER IT. IT WAS SO SHORT THAT YOU CAN SEE HIS YELLOW... I MEAN, YOU CAN SEE HIS SHAGGY ASS JUST WIGGLING UNDERNEATH THE KIMONO, RIGHT? YOU'RE KIDDING. AND HE ASKS ME, COULD I STAY AND COME IN, 'CAUSE HE HAS TO GO TO THE BACK ROOM TO GET THE MONEY. AND I SAID, NO, I'LL STAY RIGHT HERE, AND THEN HE SAYS, ARE YOU SURE, AND I SAID, OH, SURE. AND I SAID, QUITE. AND THEN, HE LEAVES, FOUR, FIVE MINUTES GO BY, HE COMES BACK WITH THE MONEY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING IN THAT BACK ROOM OR ANYTHING, BUT WHEN HE CAME BACK, SURE AS HELL, WHEN HE COMES BACK TO THE DOOR, HE HAD HIS PECKER HARD AS YOU PLEASE, PEEKING THROUGH THE SLIT OF HIS ROBE. TURN TO THE LEFT. IT WAS STARING RIGHT UP AT ME. MY GOD, IT WAS UGLY. AND SO, HE TAKES THE MONEY, AND I HAND HIM THE PIZZA LIKE NOTHING'S HAPPENING, NOTHING... YOU KNOW, IT WAS OKAY. THIS BUM HAS THE GALL TO ASK ME, SO, YOU EXPECT A TIP? AND I SAID TO HIM, IF YOUR TIP'S NO BIGGER THAN THAT, I WON'T FEEL IT. AND I JUST WALK AWAY. YOU DIDN'T. ON MY MOTHER'S GRAVE. UM... IF SHE WAS DEAD. YOU KNOW ABOUT GUSTAVO AND TAT FAN WOO, DON'T YA? NO. THEY'RE PEOPLE AT OUR STORE. NEXT TIME YOU SET UP A SPEED TRAP, YOU JUST THINK ABOUT THEM. TAT FAN WOO GOT HELD UP AT GUNPOINT THREE TIMES LAST YEAR. GUSTAVO, BADLY BEATEN. CONCUSSION, BROKEN RIBS. THREE OF 'EM. THEY REPORTED IT, DIDN'T THEY? YEAH, THEY REPORTED IT, BUT IT DIDN'T DO ANY GOOD. IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE... ( sighs deeply) I KNEW IT WOULD BE MY TURN. I HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, SO I GOT A GUN. I MEAN, IT'S QUITE SOME SET-UP. IT'S OKAY? I MEAN, JUNKIE NEEDS A FIX, RIGHT? CRACK, A ROCK, COSTS 20. RING A BELL, HUH? 20 BUCKS, 19.99. IT'S WRITTEN RIGHT ON THE BOX. SO WHY SHOULD THEY GO LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY TO MUG WHEN THEY CAN CALL UP THEIR OWN PERSONAL VICTIM, HAVE THEM GO WHEREVER THEY WANT TO? I MEAN, IT'S COMMON. COMMONPLACE THING, THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU. YOU KNOW, LIKE TONIGHT. 11645 LINCOLN AVENUE. APARTMENT 114. GO TO BACK. THAT'S HOW IT WAS WRITTEN ON THE BOX. THAT'S HOW IT'S BURNED INTO MY BRAIN. AND THE PLACE LOOKS, THOUGH DARK, PRETTY OKAY. THERE WERE TWO BOYS PLAYING BASKETBALL UNDERNEATH THE STREETLAMP, 'CAUSE IT WAS DARK. I WALKED DOWN THESE STEPS, AND I WAS WALKIN' ALONG THIS KIND OF PAVED PATHWAY, AND THERE WERE ROWS OF APARTMENTS. AND SOME OF THE APARTMENTS HAD THEIR LIGHTS ON, SO IT WAS INHABITED, I FELT SAFE. APARTMENT 114 WAS THE LAST ONE. AND I GO TO KNOCK THE DOOR, AND THEN, I HEARD A VOICE CALLING FROM BEHIND ME, AND I TURNED. THAT'S FOR ME. WHAT APARTMENT ARE YOU? 114. 114? YEAH, 114. THAT'S ME. IT WAS THIS DARK MAN. HE WAS WHITE, BUT HE HAD A BEARD AND HE WAS ALL DRESSED IN DARK, AND BLARING BLUE EYES. REALLY INTENSE. AND HE CALLED ME OVER TO HIM, AND I WENT OVER, LIKE AN IDIOT. THAT'S 25.82 FOR TWO PIZZAS. HEY, PIZZA GIRL. WHAT THE FUCK?! THEN A WHOOSHING SOUND, AND A THUMP, AND THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN THAT WAS BEHIND ME. I TURNED REAL QUICK LIKE, AND THEN, I TURNED BACK, AND THE PIZZA WENT UP IN THE AIR, AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT LANDED. I JUST WANTED TO GET AWAY, YOU KNOW? I HURT. I GOT KICKED IN THE BACK, AND I THINK I GOT KICKED IN THE SIDE. IT'S NOT HURTING NOW. TOMORROW, I'M GONNA BE ACHING. AND, UM... HE... CAME ON TOP OF ME, REAL DANGEROUS-LIKE. I BIT HIM REAL HARD, AND HE FELL BACK. I MUST'VE BIT HIM HARD, BECAUSE HE WENT BACK RIGHT, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW HE HAD A GUN. HE HAD A GUN, YOU KNOW. I NEVER THOUGHT OF USING A GUN. IT WAS REAL QUICK. I MEAN, HE HAD THE GUN. YOU KNOW? ( stammers ) I WENT FOR MY GUN, THAT'S ALL. ( stammers ) I WENT FOR MY GUN, THAT'S ALL. HE DIED BEFORE YOU GOT THERE. PAULINA, I BELIEVE YOU. ( laughs ) COME ON. THROUGH HERE? THERE YOU ARE. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOIN' OUT HERE? SORRY, SIR. I WAS JUST HAVIN' A SMOKE. PUT THAT DAMN THING OUT. I DON'T LIKE IT, FIRST-HAND OR SECOND-HAND. GET SOMETHIN' TO EAT? I'M FINE, SIR. I'M NOT ASKIN', I'M TELLIN' YA. GET SOMETHIN' TO EAT. GOT A BUNCH MORE HOURS. I DON'T WANT YA PASSIN' OUT ON ME. EAT A BRAN MUFFIN OR SOMETHIN'. ASIDE FROM THAT, ARE YOU OKAY? SURE. I'M FINE. IT'S NOT QUITE WHAT I EXPECTED, BUT THEN AGAIN, I EXPECTED THAT. DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, RIGHT? AND YOU WERE CORRECTING MY BAD ENGLISH. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. ( siren blares ) I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK I GIVE A FLYIN' CUSS. GO AHEAD, RIP OUT ANOTHER FEW YARDS OF RED TAPE. GO AHEAD! HEY, L.T., WE GOT A LIVE ONE. TOLD YOU YOU SHOULDA GOTTEN SOMETHIN' TO EAT. SON OF A BITCH WON'T STOP TALKIN'. GONNA MAKE IT ALL THE MORE ENJOYABLE WHEN I TRACK DOWN THAT BLEEDING HEART LIBERAL SON OF A BITCH, GET FACE TO FACE WITH THAT LITTLE PECKER HEAD. FULL MOON TONIGHT. ...DO YOUR JOB, THE QUICKER I CAN DO MINE, YES, SIR. OH, BIG CITY POLITICS. BIG CITY POLITICS. HAVE FUN. THANKS. MAN OUGHTA BE ABLE TO STAND UP FOR WHAT'S HIS WITHOUT Y'ALL GETTIN' INVOLVED. YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA MAKE IT? YEAH, SHE'S GONNA MAKE IT. IF YOU GUYS CAN MAKE IT, ANYBODY CAN. PAT HIM DOWN. BUT, OFFICER, THE RULES STATE WITH A MALE SUSPECT... HEY, HEY, I KNOW WHAT THE RULES SAY, AND I DON'T CARE. IF HE'S A GUY OR A GAL OR SOMETHIN' IN BETWEEN. HE'S OBVIOUSLY PISSED OFF, AND I WANT HIM DOUBLE CHECKED BEFORE WE TAKE THE CUFFS OFF HIM. ...THE PRESIDENT OF THIS GREAT LAND! ...IT'S GONNA BE YOU AND ME. FRISK HIM. THE SHIT THAT LITTLE WEASEL STIRS UP. I'M PROBABLY AT THE END OF A LONG LINE OF ASS WHIPPIN'S HE'S GOT COMIN'. ALWAYS CRYIN' ABOUT SOME STUPID ASS CAUSE HE DON'T KNOW JACK SHIT ABOUT. WHO ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT? WHO? BILLY FLAN, THAT'S WHO. All: BILLY, BILLY, BILLY, BILLY! THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE GUY ON TV EVERY DAY. AMERICA'S DAMN CONSCIENCE FROM 2:00 TO 3:00 CENTRAL TIME. AREN'T YOU TIRED OF STAYING AT HOME? HMM? TAKING CARE OF THE HOUSE, THE NAGGY, BRATTY CHILDREN, CATERING TO YOUR HUSBAND NIGHT AND DAY? IT'S A ROUTINE! SEE, WHERE I COME FROM, IT'S OKAY TO HAVE A WOMAN TO KEEP THE HOUSE CLEAN AND GIVE YOU A GOOD MEAL EVERY NIGHT. THAT'S THE WAY IT'S ALWAYS BEEN. IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR MY MAMA AND DADDY, AND THEIRS BEFORE THAT. IT'S A WAY OF LIFE. PEOPLE ARE CONTENT WITH THAT. HELL, YOU COULD EVEN SAY COMFORTABLE, LIVIN' A GOOD FAMILY LIFE. BUT BILLY DOESN'T GET IT. NO. HE'S OFF IN SOME MANSION SOMEWHERE, PEOPLE WAITIN' ON HIM HAND AND FOOT. I BETCHA HIS WIFE DON'T HAVE DISHPAN HANDS. NO, SIR. I'M GONNA NEED SOME FACTS. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? BUFORD LOWRY. ONE DAY, I WAS SICK. THE ONE AND ONLY DAY I WAS SICK. IN 22 YEARS OF WORK, I HAPPENED TO BE AT HOME AND DECIDED TO WATCH THAT CRAP. WELCOME BACK. MY NEXT GUEST HAS HAD IT UP TO HERE, AND IS NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE. PLEASE WELCOME MRS. BUFORD LOWRY. YOU'RE ANGRY. YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I'M ANGRY. ALL THESE YEARS, I JUMPED WHENEVER BUFORD NEEDED ANYTHING. IF HE WANTED A BEER, I JUMPED. IF HE WANTED SOME CHEWIN' TOBACCO AT THE PIGGILY WIGGILY, I JUMPED. IF HE WANTED TO PUT HIS PICKLE INTO MY JAR, DAMN IT, I JUMPED. WELL, NO MORE, BUFORD. DO YOU HEAR ME? I'M MOVIN' ON TO GREENER PASTURES WHERE MEN RESPECT WOMEN AND PICKLES TURN INTO CUCUMBERS. YOU KNOW, PHIL, ALL THESE YEARS-- BILLY. BILLY. BILLY. BILLY, ALL THESE YEARS, IT'S JUST BEEN THE SAME ROUTINE. HE'D COME HOME AT NIGHT, TAKE THIS CHANNEL CLICKER AWAY FROM ME, LAY ON THE COUCH WHILE I RUBBED HIS FEET, AND WATCHED HIM FLIP IT, FLIP IT, FLIP IT. DAMN IT, I NEVER EVEN GOT TO WATCH AN ENTIRE PRIME TIME SHOW ONCE SINCE WE'VE HAD THE GODDAMN THING. WELL, NO MORE. NO MORE, BUDDY! I'M NOT DOIN' THAT ONE MORE TIME, DO YOU HEAR ME? THAT'S IT, BUFORD. THERE'S GONNA BE SOME CHANGES AROUND HERE, AND I GOT THE CHANNEL SWITCHER TO PROVE IT. WELL, NEEDLESS TO SAY, I WAS BESIDE MYSELF. BUT IT DIDN'T STOP THERE. I JUST WANNA SAY, YOU'RE A LOVELY WOMAN, I ADMIRE YOUR COURAGE, AND DON'T GO BACK TO THAT SCUM-SUCKING PIG. ( applause ) AND THEN, THAT SON OF A BITCH GETS ON A BOX AND ACTS LIKE HE UNDERSTANDS LIFE IN THESE UNITED STATES. I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE ROOM WHEN I SAY YOU'RE BETTER THAN HE IS, AND YOU'RE GONNA MAKE SOMETHING OF YOUR LIFE! WELL, HE AIN'T GOT A CLUE. HE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAUL FREIGHT FOR YELLOW TRANSIT 12 HOURS A DAY FOR 22 YEARS. HE CLAIMS TO HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS, BUT HE'S JUST SCREWIN' UP PEOPLE'S LIVES. EVERYTHING WAS JUST FINE TILL HE CAME ALONG. YOU SEE, MY WIFE RECENTLY GOT LAID OFF AT THE GM PLANT, AND SHE SUDDENLY FOUND BILLY. ( chanting, applause on TV ) NOW SHE SAYS I'VE BEEN CHOKIN' HER FULL POTENTIAL TO BE THE WOMAN SHE'S BEEN HIDING INSIDE FOR YEARS. THAT SHE MIGHT BE A SURGEON OR A LAWYER OR DISCOVER A CURE FOR CANCER IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME. DAMN IT, SHE CAN'T EVEN BALANCE A CHECKBOOK. BUT BILLY HAS HER BELIEVIN' SHE'S GONNA BE THE NEXT MADAME CURIE! DON'T LET THAT JACK-OFF RUIN YOUR LIFE. ADDRESS. 117 MOODY BRIDGE ROAD. ( angry clamoring ) ( booing ) WHO CARES IF HE PUTS YOU ON A PEDESTAL? LOVES YOU, TAKES CARE OF YOU, PROVIDES FOR YOU? YOU CAN DO THAT YOURSELF. JOIN THE WOMAN'S MOVEMENT. EVERYTHING WAS JUST FINE UNTIL HE POINTED THAT OUT TO HER. WHAT GIVES THESE PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO COME INTO MY LIVIN' ROOM AND PROFESS TO KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR MY FAMILY AND PUSH ALL THEIR LITTLE BUTTONS AND SCREW UP OUR PERFECTLY NORMAL LIVES? I TAPED THAT SHOW AND WATCHED IT. PHIL, GERALDO, SALLY, RICKI. OPRAH. NO, I LIKE HER. COME ON, LET'S GET YOU FINGERPRINTED. THE REST OF 'EM ALL ACT LIKE THEY HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS WHEN THERE AIN'T NO PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH. SHIT. I THINK IT WAS SAFER WATCHING JIM AND TAMMY. AT LEAST YOU KNEW THEY WERE IDIOTS AT A GLANCE. BUT THESE OTHERS, HOOK, LINE AND SINKER. DAMN IT. IT'S JUST A TV SHOW, FOR GOD'S SAKE. THEY ACT LIKE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO CANCEL THE AMERICAN MIND FROM 2:00 TO 3:00 CENTRAL WEEKDAYS. HOW CAN THIS GO ON? AREN'T THERE MEDICAL LAWS AGAINST THAT? NOTHIN'S EVER SOLVED. NOTHIN' POSITIVE EVER HAPPENS. THEY JUST TALK AND TALK AND ARGUE AND BICKER, AND THEN, THERE'S A FEW COMMERCIALS. AND EVERYTHING GETS LEFT UP IN THE AIR AS THE CREDITS ROLL. AND WE BUY IT. AMERICA BUYS IT. EVERYBODY GETS ALL WORKED UP OVER SOME ISSUE THAT WOULDN'T EVER CROSS THEIR MIND IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUT BECAUSE BILLY SAYS IT, THEN IT COMES DOWN OFF THE MOUNTAIN LIKE IT'S WRITTEN IN STONE TABLETS. BILLY SAID THIS, BILLY SAID THAT. I'M GONNA FIND THAT LITTLE SHIT, AND I'M GONNA SAY SOME THINGS TO HIM THAT HE CAN PUT IN THE BANK AND DRAW INTEREST ON. AND THEN I'M GONNA LAY HIM OUT FLAT ON HIS BACK SO HE DON'T GET UP FOR THREE DAYS. THEN I'M GONNA GO BACK HOME AND START OVER WHAT USED TO BE A MODERATELY HAPPY FAMILY LIFE UNTIL THE TIME HE STARTED INVADIN' MY TERRITORY. YOU SEE, HE'S THE ONE GUILTY OF TRESPASSING. WHAT WILL BEATING HIM UP SOLVE? WHAT WILL IT SOLVE? TURN TO THE LEFT, TAKE YOUR HAT OFF, PLEASE. I'LL FEEL A HELL OF A LOT BETTER, THAT'S WHAT. MAYBE HE CAN DO A SHOW ABOUT THE JOY OF BEATIN' THE LIVIN' HELL OUT OF SOMEBODY WHO CAN'T MIND HIS OWN DAMN BUSINESS. GODDAMN IT! MY WIFE LEFT ME. SHE TOOK THE KIDS AND WENT HOME TO HER MOTHER. SHE'S FILIN' FOR DIVORCE. TURN TO THE RIGHT. THANK YOU, BILLY. WHO GIVE YOU A LICENSE TO PRACTICE? YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA FIND HIM. AND AFTER THAT, I THINK I'LL GO FIND THAT DR. RUTH WOMAN. THAT SAWED-OFF LITTLE MIDGET BITCH. I'LL SLAP HER INTO NEXT WEEK. HOW CAN I HELP YOU, SIR? MY NAME IS NORMAN FRIEDLER. I'VE COME TO TURN MYSELF IN. YOU KNOW, I JUST DID WHAT I HAD TO DO. ACTUALLY, WHAT MY WIFE WANTED ME TO DO. IT WASN'T EASY, BUT I HAD TO RESPECT HER DECISION. YOU KNOW, WHEN MY WIFE MADE UP HER MIND TO DO SOMETHING, YOU DAMN WELL BETTER DO IT. OTHERWISE, YOU NEVER HEAR THE END OF IT. GRANTED, WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I USED TO STAND UP TO HER. BUT AFTER 53 YEARS OF MARRIAGE, YOU LEARN IT'S A HELL OF A LOT EASIER JUST TO GIVE IN. 53 YEARS. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? UNFORTUNATELY, CANCER ISN'T SOMETHING YOU CAN ANTICIPATE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A PICTURE OF ANNIE? SURE. SEE? OH, SHE IS BEAUTIFUL. NOT ONLY THAT, SHE WAS ONE HELL OF A GOLFER. BOY, WHAT A COMPETITOR. YOU KNOW, SHE WOULD REFUSE TO TEE OFF ON A LADY'S TEE. IT HAD TO BE A MAN'S TEE OR SHE WOULDN'T PLAY. SHE'S A FIGHTER, THAT ONE. BUT I GUESS THIS LAST FIGHT WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH. WISH I COULDA DONE SOMETHING. IT'S GONNA BE LONELY AROUND HERE WITHOUT HER. THE WALKS, THE TALKS, PLAYING CARDS, KINGS ON THE CORNER. YOU SEE, WE DISCUSSED THIS POSSIBILITY BEFORE, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE TO ACTUALLY DO IT. SHE KNEW HOW SQUEAMISH I WAS ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING, BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED ONCE. WHEN I WAS YOUNG, MY MOTHER TOLD ME TO GET RID OF A RABBIT THAT WAS IN THE GARDEN EATING UP ALL HER VEGETABLES. SO I GRABBED MY BROTHER'S PELLET GUN, AND I SHOT IT. ONLY IT DIDN'T DIE. IT JUST LAY THERE AND LOOKED AT ME. SO I RAN BACK IN THE HOUSE AND GOT MY OLDER BROTHER MIKE TO COME OUTSIDE. AFTER A LOOK OF ANGUISH, HE GRABS THE GUN FROM ME AND SHOOTS THE RABBIT, AND HE SAYS, NORMAN, NEVER START SOMETHING YOU CAN'T FINISH. THEN HE RUNS IN THE HOUSE. BOY, WAS I ANGRY. I WAS SO MAD AT HIM. AND AFTER A MOMENT, I THOUGHT, HE'S RIGHT. THE RABBIT WAS AT PEACE. AND SO IS MY ANNIE NOW. SO, DEAR, THINK I'LL HAVE TO BE HERE LONG? I HAVE TO GET TO THE MALL EARLY IN THE MORNING TO TAKE MY WALK. THE DOCTOR SAYS I NEED MY EXERCISE. OUR DOCTOR. HE'S A GOOD MAN. HE HOOKED ANNIE UP TO ALL THOSE TUBES FOR THE DRUGS TO GO THROUGH. THERE'S, UH, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? WELL, THERE'S THE FENTANYL. HE CALLED IT... FENTANYL FENATYL. FENTANYL. YEAH. HE EVEN POINTED OUT THE LITTLE KNOB THAT WOULD INCREASE THE DOSAGE. AS A DOCTOR, NORMAN, I'M PROFESSIONALLY OBLIGATED TO ADVISE AGAINST IT; IT'S MY JOB TO KEEP PEOPLE ALIVE. I DON'T WANNA GET HIM IN TROUBLE; HE TOLD US NOT TO USE IT. BUT HE WASN'T LYING THERE IN PAIN. OH, THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO; THERE WAS NOTHING ANYONE COULD DO. WE ALL KNEW SHE WAS GONNA DIE. WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHEN. COULD BE AN HOUR, A DAY, MAYBE A WEEK. ( machine beeping ) AND THEN, TONIGHT, WHEN THE NURSE LEFT, SHE CALLED ME OVER. WHEN THE NURSE LEFT, SHE CALLED ME OVER. AS A DOCTOR, NORMAN, I'M PROFESSIONALLY OBLIGATED TO ADVISE AGAINST IT. IT'S MY JOB TO KEEP PEOPLE ALIVE, BUT AS A PERSON, AS YOUR FRIEND, I'M IN NO POSITION TO JUDGE YOU. AS YOUR FRIEND, I'M IN NO POSITION TO JUDGE YOU. MR. FRIEDLER. MR... NORMAN. HUH? ARE YOU OKAY? OH, YEAH, YEAH. YEAH, SHE CALLED ME OVER, AND SHE SAID... NORMAN, IT'S TIME. Doctor: THERE'S THE FENTANYL, BUT GIVE HER TOO MUCH, AND SHE WILL SLEEP FOREVER. WELL, I DON'T WANNA TAKE UP ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME. I KNOW YOU HAVE A JOB TO DO. WE ALL HAVE TO DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. WE ALL HAVE TO DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. MR. FRIEDLER, I'M SORRY. I'VE GOTTA PLACE YOU UNDER ARREST. SIR, IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY? I DON'T WRITE THE LAW. WHAT CAN I DO? MR. FRIEDLER, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT. IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO REMAIN SILENT, ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW. AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW. OH. YOU'RE A VERY NICE PERSON. OKAY, I'M READY. IT'S OKAY. YOU CAN TAKE THE PICTURE. YOU OKAY? OH. YES, SIR, I'M FINE. WE'RE RELEASING MR. FRIEDLER ON HIS OWN RECOGNIZANCE. THAT'S WONDERFUL. YEAH. THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME, LIEUTENANT. HELLO, MOM? HI. OH, I'M SORRY I WOKE YOU UP. I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE. NO, NOTHING'S WRONG. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU AND DAD ARE DOIN' OKAY. I MEAN, LAST TIME WE TALKED, THINGS DIDN'T END UP SO GOOD. YEAH, MOM, I KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS. I JUST... IS DAD THERE? NO. NO, NO, DON'T WAKE HIM UP. NO, MOM, I DON'T WANT ANYTHING. IT'S JUST... IT'S JUST MY FIRST DAY AT WORK, AND, UM... SOMETHING MADE ME THINK ABOUT YOU GUYS. NO. NO, I GRADUATED THIS WEEK. WITH HONORS. YEAH, UM... YEAH, I WISH YOU GUYS COULD'VE BEEN THERE FOR THE CEREMONY, BUT I UNDERSTAND. YEAH, IT'S A LONG TRIP. Female officer: YEAH, I'M GONNA LOCK IT UP RIGHT NOW. Male officer: YOU GOT THE EVIDENCE? YEAH. DON'T PUSH ME. I'M GONNA CALL YOU TOMORROW. YEAH. YEAH. OR MAYBE, I MEAN, LATER TODAY. MOM, GIVE DAD A HUG FOR ME, OKAY? LOVE YOU. BYE. ALL RIGHT, MARY POPPINS, TAKE THOSE VALUABLES OFF. WHAT ARE YOU STARIN' AT? IT'S AFTER MIDNIGHT, WERE YOU EXPECTING CINDERELLA? HEY, SWEETIE. ( blows kiss ) OH, I SEE. I GET IT. YOU'RE ONE, TOO, HUH? YOU MACHO FUCK. COME WITH ME, SIR. I MEAN... THIS WAY. IT'S ABOUT TIME WE GOT ON WITH THIS. I MEAN, I'D LIKE TO GET OUTTA HERE SOME TIME BEFORE SUNRISE. SIR! WHAT THE HELL CAUSES YOU PEOPLE TO TAKE SO LONG ANYWAY? THE SYSTEM SUCKS. I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE IT DOWN BY NOW. I'M SURE IT'S NOT LIKE SOMETHING NEW FOR YOU. YOU'D BE SURPRISED. IT SEEMS LIKE I'VE BEEN HERE FOR HOURS, AND ALL FOR WHAT? TWO PAIR OF EARRINGS AND A PAIR OF STOCKINGS. OH, AND A COMPACT. THOSE DAMN THINGS JUST NEVER LAST. BUT YOU'D THINK THAT I CRUCIFIED CHRIST. SIR, I'M SORRY. AM I, UH... NO, GO AHEAD. DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO. I'M JUST CHECKIN' A FILE. EXCUSE ME. I'D LIKE TO REGISTER A COMPLAINT. YEAH? YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE. COME ON. IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR A LITTLE RESPECT? THOSE TWO DETECTIVES, COLLINS AND SIMS, THEY HAD ME IN THAT INTERROGATION ROOM FOR OVER AN HOUR. ACTUALLY, I THINK SIMS HAD A COUPLE OF OTHER QUESTIONS HE WOULD'VE LIKE TO ASK ME UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. TRUST ME, THE SIGNS WERE THERE. IT'S VERY OBVIOUS FROM THIS SIDE OF THE FENCE, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, BUT I SUPPOSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT ANYTHING LIKE THAT, WOULD YOU? NO ANSWER? WELL... HEY, STOP BUSTIN' MY CHOPS. IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY. OH, RELAX. I'M JUST KIDDING. LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE INSIDE TIP THOUGH. I DON'T KNOW THAT I'D WANT TO BE STUCK IN THE SHOWER ALONE WITH SIMS AFTER WORK. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU GONNA STAND THERE ALL NIGHT? GET HIM OUTTA HERE. SORRY, SIR. THIS WAY. COME ON. REMEMBER WHAT I SAID. I MUST GIVE HIM CREDIT, THOUGH. HE DOES A PRETTY GOOD MACHO ACT FOR COLLINS. I GUESS HE HAS TO. BIG, TOUGH COP. GOTTA PLAY THE ROLE. IT'S HIS JOB, HUH? WHILE HE'S HERE, ANYWAY. ALL RIGHT, TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF. WHY? HEIGHT. OH. YEAH, I GUESS THAT DOES MAKE SENSE. GUESS THEY DO ADD AN INCH OR TWO. OH, GOD. THANK YOU. I ALWAYS FORGET HOW GOOD IT FEELS TO TAKE 'EM OFF. ALMOST GIVES ME AN ERECTION. MM. OH, COME ON. WHERE'S YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR? STUCK BEHIND ALL THAT MACHISMO? MM? WELL, I TRIED. UH, SIR, I'M OUT OF FILM, AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS. SEE DORIS. SHE'LL SHOW YOU WHERE IT IS. I'LL COVER FOR YOU. THANK YOU, SIR. JESUS, YOU GUYS ARE A STUDY OF INCOMPETENCE, YOU REALLY ARE. I MEAN, YOU WASTE MORE TIME THAN MY CONGRESSMAN. THIS IS SO SILLY ANYWAY. IS IT REALLY WORTH ALL THIS TROUBLE? I TOOK A COUPLE OF PAIR OF EARRINGS; IT'S NOT LIKE I ROBBED FORT KNOX. MY ASS IS KILLIN' ME. OH, GOD. THANKS, TOOTS. OH! MY SHRINK PROBABLY THINKS I WAS SETTING MYSELF UP TO GET CAUGHT. THEY ALWAYS SAY THAT. I DON'T KNOW. I'M SURE NOT ENJOYING ANY OF THIS. COULD I HAVE A COUPLE OF THOSE TISSUES? HELP YOURSELF. CHEERS, MATE. IT'S TOO BAD I WON'T LOOK PRETTY FOR THE PICTURE, BUT I GOTTA TAKE SOME OF THIS STUFF OFF. HAD IT ON TOO LONG. IF I DON'T TAKE IT OFF NOW, I'LL BREAK OUT. MAN, MEN JUST DON'T APPRECIATE WHAT WOMEN HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO ACHIEVE THAT CERTAIN JE NE SAIS QUOI. THAT CERTAIN LOOK. OH, I TAKE THAT BACK. I'LL BET SOME MEN DO. I BET DETECTIVE SIMS DOES. OH, WELL. HERE GOES NOTHING. YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH THESE THINGS. ONCE, I GLUED MY RIGHT EYELID SHUT FOR, LIKE, THREE HOURS. IT WAS A DISASTER. OH, THERE. OH, WELL, TIME FOR A NEW PAIR ANYWAY. I GOT IT. I'LL JUST RELOAD IT AND WE'LL BE READY TO GO. WHAT TIME IS IT, HUH? I REALLY DO HAVE TO GET UP AT THE CRACK OF DAWN. I THOUGHT YOU WOULD'VE SLEPT ALL DAY. WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT? OH, YOU THINK I'M A HOOKER, DON'T YOU? I WAS WONDERING ABOUT SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS THEY WERE ASKING ME IN THERE. WELL, I GUESS I CAN SEE WHY YOU MIGHT THINK THAT, BUT NO, NO, NO. I'M NOT A HOOKER. I JUST, UM... I JUST LIKE THE WAY THIS FEELS. WHAT, IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT? HUH? IT ALL STARTED OUT INNOCENTLY ENOUGH. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, REALLY. ONE HALLOWEEN, MY GIRLFRIEND AND I DECIDED TO REVERSE ROLES. YOUR GIRLFRIEND? YEAH, GIRLFRIEND. I LIKE WOMEN. THAT MAKES ME A CROSS-DRESSER, NOT A TRANSVESTITE. SHIT. LABELS. ANYWAY, THAT NIGHT, SHE DECIDED TO GO AS A PIMP, AND I WENT AS A HOOKER. AND BELIEVE ME, I LOOKED A LOT TRASHIER THAN THIS. BUT AS THE NIGHT WENT ON, I STARTED FEELING SO... SENSUAL. LIKE THERE WAS THIS PART OF ME THAT I HAD NO IDEA EXISTED. SORTA LIKE I... I WAS FINISHING A PUZZLE. YOU KNOW, I FELT COMPLETE. LIEUTENANT, THIS... GENTLEMAN'S GIRLFRIEND IS OUT FRONT; SHE BROUGHT THESE CLOTHES FOR HIM. HE'S ALMOST READY. WE JUST GOTTA GET HIS POLAROIDS. EXCUSE ME, SIR. MAYBE HE COULD CHANGE HIS CLOTHES BEFORE WE GET THE PICTURE. OKAY. DORIS, GIVE 'EM TO HIM. APPRECIATE THAT. YOU'RE WELCOME. TELL HER I'LL BE RIGHT... RIGHT OUT. YOU KNOW, I READ OR HEARD SOMEWHERE THAT WE ALL HAVE A MALE AND A FEMALE SIDE. I GUESS MY FEMALE SIDE IS JUST A LITTLE BIT OUT OF BALANCE. OR IS IT? OH, DAMN IT, I LIKE THE WAY THIS FEELS. IT'S JUST, I DON'T KNOW, THE HANDS. ACTUALLY, THEY'RE NOT TOO BAD. THE WAY WOMEN CARRY THEMSELVES-- IT'S ALLURING. DRAWING OTHERS IN. THEY DON'T INTIMIDATE. NOT FORCEFUL. AS IN FORCING THEMSELVES ON OTHERS. ( sighs deeply ) I LIKE THAT. I DON'T SEE WHY PEOPLE THINK I'M SICK. I MEAN, NOBODY CARES IF A WOMAN WEARS A MAN'S CLOTHES. IN FACT, WE CONDONE IT. WE THINK IT'S CUTE AND SEXY, LIKE IF THEY WEAR A MAN'S BUTTON-DOWN OR BOXER SHORTS. BUT THAT'S THE RULES WE LIVE BY. AND THAT'S WHY I CAN'T LET ANYBODY FIND OUT ABOUT THIS. THIS IS CRAZY, BUT THAT'S WHY I STOLE THOSE THINGS. FOR SOME REASON, I JUST COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO BUY THEM. I WANTED TO, BUT I COULDN'T. LIKE THE CLERK WOULD KNOW THEY WERE FOR ME. A MAN. A MAN DRESSED AS A WOMAN. AND THEN, SHE WOULD TELL EVERYONE, AND THEN... I JUST CAN'T LET ANYBODY FIND OUT ABOUT THIS. ESPECIALLY THE GUYS I WORK WITH. MY BOSS. MACHO FUCK. HE'D NEVER UNDERSTAND. AND I CAN'T AFFORD TO GET FIRED. SEE, I'M A CARPENTER. I FRAME HOUSES. I LOVE MY JOB. WORKING WITH WOOD. I THINK IT'S ONE OF GOD'S MOST MAGNIFICENT CREATIONS. IT CAN BE DECEPTIVE, TOO. YOU CAN TAKE ONE OF THE MOST COARSE GRAIN, KNOTTY, UGLY OLD PIECES OF OAK, AND YOU CAN SLAP A FEW COATS OF PAINT ON IT, HAMMER A FEW NAILS, AND IT COULD BE A REAL NICE PIECE OF FURNITURE. THEN, AT THE SAME TOKEN, YOU COULD TAKE A PLANER AND YOU COULD STRIP IT DOWN, TAKING AWAY A LAYER OR TWO, AND IT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PIECES OF WOOD THAT GOD PUT ON THE PLANET. BUT YOU SEE, EITHER WAY, IN THE RIGHT HANDS, IT COULD BE BEAUTIFUL. LIEUTENANT? YEAH. I WANTED YOU TO HAVE THIS. OFFICER KOY PICKED THEM UP WHILE HE WAS OUT. NO SPRINKLES. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. I WANTED TO, SIR. I WANTED TO MAKE UP FOR THE ROUGH START WE HAD EARLIER. OH, COME ON, IT'S NO PROBLEM. THANKS FOR THE DOUGHNUTS. ( chuckles ) SIR. YEAH. I WANT YOU TO KNOW I WORKED HARD TO GET HERE. GRADUATED TOP OF MY CLASS. BEING AN OFFICER IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. TERRIFIC. BUT JUST REMEMBER, YOU CAN'T DO EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK. ISN'T IT OUR JOB TO UPHOLD THE LAW? I'M JUST TELLING YOU THAT THEY DON'T, THEY CAN'T, PREPARE YOU FOR THE HUMAN ELEMENT. NOT PREACHING. JUST USE YOUR COMMON SENSE, THAT'S ALL. I THINK I UNDERSTAND. THAT MAN, THAT MR. FRIEDLER, I'M GONNA BE CARRYING HIM AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. WHAT HE DID WAS ILLEGAL, BUT IT, UM... ULTIMATELY, EXPERIENCE IS GONNA BE YOUR BEST FRIEND. AND THEN YOU'LL REALIZE THAT THE ROOKIE BLACK AND WHITE BY THE BOOK BLENDS INTO A COMFORTABLE GRAY SO WELCOME TO THE GRAY BAR INN... WHERE YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT THAT THIS IS JUST A JOB, AND YOU LEAVE IT RIGHT HERE WHEN YOU WALK OUT THAT DOOR. YOU A FRIEND OF BILL W.'s? NO. YOU? NO. SO, UM, WHY DO YOU HAVE THAT? SORRY. I'M ASKING TOO MANY QUESTIONS. NO, ASK AS MANY QUESTIONS AS YOU LIKE. THIS WAS A GIFT FROM A FRIEND OF MINE; I PUT HIM RIGHT THROUGH THE SYSTEM. SENDS ME ONE FROM TIME TO TIME, JUST TO LET ME KNOW THAT HE'S OKAY. THAT'S A TEN-YEAR CHIP, ISN'T IT? MM-HMM. IS MY BOX OKAY? LISTEN TO ME, THIS IS IMPORTANT. IS MY BOX OKAY? I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. MY BOX, BIG BOX. REFRIGERATOR BOX. FRIGIDAIRE. ABOUT YEA BIG. IT'S ALL YOURS. I GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE. MY OLD LADY, I MEAN, IT COULD HAPPEN... I'M TELLING YOU, THAT BOX BETTER BE SAFE. IT'S ALL I GOT! SHIT! I REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS. HIS NAME WAS JOHNNY BENJAMIN. HE LIVED ON THE STREETS. I NOTICED HIM FROM TIME TO TIME. BUT I NEVER PAID HIM MUCH ATTENTION. HE WAS ALWAYS LUGGING AROUND THIS BIG REFRIGERATOR BOX. AND HIS HANDS WERE SO DIRTY, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A CLEAN PRINT. I MEAN, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? ANSWER ME THAT. I'M WALKIN' ALONG THIRD AVENUE, AND I COME TO THE INTERSECTION THERE AT ROTHMAN, AND I BEND OVER AND I START SWEEPING THE CURB, LIKE I ALWAYS DO. THAT'S MY JOB. SELF-APPOINTED, BUT SOMEBODY'S GOTTA DO IT. I MEAN, IF WE AIN'T CAREFUL, THIS LITTER CRAP IS GONNA GET WAY OUT OF HAND. ANYWAY, THIS GUY... IN SOME FANCY-ASS SPORTS CAR PULLS UP TO THE CURB AND... A TACO BELL BAG COMES FLYIN' OUT OF THE WINDOW, LIKE PIGEON SHIT OUT OF THE SKY. LIKE IT'S ACCEPTABLE. A TACO BELL BAG. WELL, HUH... WELL, HE SHOULDA MADE A RUN FOR THE BORDER, BUT HE CAUGHT A RED LIGHT. TOO BAD FOR HIM. I WALKED OVER, I OPENED HIS DOOR, AND I BEAT THE HELL OUT OF HIM WITH MY WHISK BROOM. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S WORTH IT. I MEAN, DO YOU THINK HE'LL EVER DO THAT AGAIN? I SERIOUSLY DOUBT IT. I'M A DRY LITTLE POPCORN FART. DO YOU MIND? HOLD IT A SECOND. WHAT THE HELL YOU GOT HERE? IT'S OKAY, IT'S JUST LOTION. WANT SOME? RARELY USE THE STUFF. SUIT YOURSELF. DON'T LET YOURSELF GO, AGE BEFORE YOU HAVE TO. IT'S THE CITY AIR, YOU KNOW, ALL THAT SHIT THAT'S IN THE AIR. HEY, I HEARD THAT THERE IS A HOLE STARTING TO OPEN UP IN THE SKY. WHY DOESN'T ANYBODY WANNA KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT? SHIT, I DON'T WANNA GO UP LIKE A T-BONE AT A BARBECUE. WE BETTER START LOOKIN' INTO THIS SHIT, MAN, OR OUR KIDS AIN'T GONNA HAVE NOTHIN' TO LOOK FORWARD TO. GOTTA REMEMBER, THIS WAS THE EARLY '80s. FOR THAT TIME, THIS GUY WAS ALMOST A VISIONARY. YOU COULDN'T HELP BUT LIKE HIM. SORRY, JOHNNY, IT'S GONNA BE A WHILE. THAT'S COOL, MAN. YOU'RE DOIN' THE BEST YOU CAN. LET'S GO DOWN THE HALL; IT'LL BE MORE COMFORTABLE. YOU'RE THE BOSS. DINOSAURS, THAT'S THE KEY. EXCUSE ME? DINOSAURS. I'M GLAD THAT KIDS DIG ON DINOSAURS THE WAY THEY DO, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE-- MODERN-DAY DINOSAURS. YOU'D THINK WE'D HAVE LEARNED SOMETHING FROM THEM DINOSAURS. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE INTELLIGENT BEINGS. YOU KNOW, I READ SOMEWHERE, SOME OF THEM DINOSAURS HAD BRAINS THE SIZE OF A PEANUT. WELL, THERE YA ARE. THEY HAD A GOOD EXCUSE FOR EXTINCTION, BUT WHAT WILL OURS BE? INDIFFERENCE. WHO'D WANNA BRING A KID IN THE WORLD WITH THAT IN MIND? NOBODY CARES. WELL, I CARE. I LIVE OUT THERE ON THE STREETS, SO I CARE. I HAVE TO CARE, 'CAUSE THAT'S MY HOME. I DON'T SHIT IN YOUR LIVING ROOM, PLEASE DON'T SHIT IN MINE. OY. YOU CAN THROW AWAY A CAN ONCE IN A WHILE, THAT'S INCOME. IF MORE PEOPLE KNEW THAT, THEN EVERYBODY WOULD RECYCLE IT. YEAH. JOHNNY TOUCHED ME. HE STUCK A CHORD IN ME. MADE ME LOOK AT THINGS IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD DO THIS SOCIETY SOME GOOD? I THINK EVERYONE OUGHTA GO THROUGH A DUMPSTER, JUST ONE TIME, GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY. YOU, TOO, CHIEF. YOU CAN CALL ME MIKE. MIKE. THAT'S REAL NICE. NOW WE AIN'T STRANGERS NO MORE. DEFINITELY NOT. ANYWAY, MIKE, IF YOU GO THROUGH A DUMPSTER, THEN YOU'D SEE ALL THE WASTE. SO MUCH WASTE. PERSONALLY, I DIG THROUGH ALL OF IT. BUT MY OLD LADY, SHE IS A SCAVENGER QUEEN. SHE LIKES TO CONCENTRATE ON THOSE LITTLE WHITE 13-GALLON BAGS. SHE SAYS MOST OF THEM COME FROM BATHROOMS. I SAY, HONEY, THERE'S SOME GROSS STUFF IN BATHROOMS. I MEAN, SHE'S GOT MORE MAKEUP THAN THE AVON LADY. FOUND HERSELF A LITTLE BLUE CARRYING CASE. SHE LIKES TO LOOK GOOD. DID YOU KNOW, THERE AIN'T A SINGLE FEMALE IN THIS CITY THAT USES A WHOLE COMPACT? THEY SEE THAT LITTLE PIECE OF SILVER START SHININ' THROUGH THE POWDER, PFFT, THEY TOSS IT. MY OLD LADY CAN MAKE THAT LAST ANOTHER MONTH. SHE TAKES LITTLE PIECES OF SOAP, LAYS IT OUT IN THE SUN, TILL THEY GET SORTA MUSHY, SIX OR SEVEN OF THOSE ALL ROLLED TOGETHER, GOT A WHOLE NEW BAR. THAT'S WASTE. IT'S NOTHIN' BUT WASTE. SO YOU SEE, YOU'RE LUCKY WE'RE OUT THERE. EXCEPT WE GOT ALL THE GOOD GROCERY CARTS. PUT YOUR TOES ON THE LINE, FACE THE CAMERA. ANYWAY, LIFE GOES ON. C'EST LA VIE. THE CYCLE CONTINUES. ALL YOU CAN DO IS LIVE EVERY MINUTE AND DIE A LITTLE BIT EVERY DAY. OKAY, NOW GIVE US YOUR LEFT PROFILE. JUST HAVE TO HOPE YOUR HEART'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE. THE DINOSAURS. DON'T FORGET THE DINOSAURS. LISTEN, THAT COP AMENDEZ, WHO DROVE ME IN HERE, HE SAID HE'D TAKE CARE OF MY BOX. HE WOULDN'T LIE TO ME, WOULD HE? THAT BOX MUST BE AWFUL IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT IT IS. WHY? WELL, YOU SEE, ABOUT NINE MONTHS AGO, I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THAT LONG, 'CAUSE I'M ABOUT DUE FOR A NINE-MONTH CHIP-- THAT A.A. IS A GOOD THING, MAN. I THINK IT'S GONNA HELP ME GET BACK ON MY FEET. ANYWAY, I WAS IN THIS 7-ELEVEN, AND I HAD A LITTLE SPARE CHANGE ON ME. WELL, I STOOD THERE FOR THE LONGEST TIME DEBATIN' MYSELF. CONDOM. BURRITO. CONDOM. BURRITO. CONDOM. BURRITO. I GUESS I MADE THE WRONG CHOICE. I WAS A SMART SHOPPER. IN CASE I DON'T SEE YOU, YOU'RE THE FIRST, MIKE. ANY DAY NOW, MY OLD LADY IS GONNA HAVE A KID. SO THAT'S WHY I NEED THAT BOX. THAT REFRIGERATOR BOX IS GONNA BE OUR DELIVERY ROOM. TAKE IT EASY. I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN. WHAT HAPPENED? DID THEY HAVE THAT KID? WELL, ABOUT NINE YEARS LATER, THIS ARRIVED WITH ONE OF THE CHIPS. THAT'S MIKE BENJAMIN. MIKE? YEAH. I GUESS THEY NAMED THE KID AFTER ME. REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT LEAVIN' THE JOB HERE WHEN YOU GO HOME? MAYBE SOME THINGS ARE WORTH TAKING HOME. HEY, LIEUTENANT, WE GOT A LOOSE CANNON OUT THERE. GIVE IT TO THE ROOKIE. YEAH? BETTER PUT THIS ON, CHRIS. SHE'S HIV-POSITIVE. SHE'S CALMED DOWN NOW, BUT EARLY THIS EVENING, SHE OPENED UP A VEIN AND LET HER BLOOD FLY ALL OVER THE MEMBERS OF THE SCHOOL BOARD. SHE'S SEWED UP NOW, BUT I'D PUT THOSE ON, TAKE ALL NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS. SIMS, I GOT THE NICOLE SAVITA REPORT FOR YOU THERE. THANKS, DORIS. YOU'RE WELCOME. WHEN WE PICKED HER UP AT COUNTY GENERAL, THEY SAID THAT WHEN THEY FIRST BROUGHT HER IN TO BE STITCHED, SHE WAS WAY OUT THERE, SO THEY HAD TO STRAP HER DOWN TO THE BED AND GIVE HER SOMETHING JUST TO KNOCK HER OUT. SINCE THEN, THE DOCTOR SAYS SHE'S AS CALM AS A BABY LAMB, BUT THEY GOT HER ON SUICIDE WATCH JUST THE SAME. I DON'T WANNA TAKE ANY CHANCES. LET'S RUN HER THROUGH AS QUICK AS WE CAN. GET HER OVER TO COUNTY 13th FLOOR, THAT'S THEIR JOB. PALEY, YOU AND COLLINS RUN HER THROUGH; SIMS, YOU'RE WITH ME ON THE BOOKING RECOMMENDATION. I KNOW WE GOT RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT FOR SURE, BUT THIS CASE IS SO STRANGE, WE MIGHT HAVE TO GO ANOTHER WAY. HELLO, MA'AM. I'M LIEUTENANT BROSLOE. I ASSURE YOU, WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE THINGS QUICK AND COMFORTABLE. YOU JUST GO ALONG WITH OFFICER COLLINS AND OFFICER PALEY HERE, WE'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU. THANK YOU. MY PLEASURE. DID YOU KNOW THEY STRAPPED ME DOWN IN THAT HOSPITAL LIKE I WAS SOME KIND OF ANIMAL? THAT'S JUST STANDARD PROCEDURE, MA'AM. WE HAVE TO DO THAT ON ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. SUICIDE? I WASN'T TRYING TO COMMIT SUICIDE. I WAS TRYING TO MAKE A POINT. DOESN'T ANYBODY REALIZE THAT? WE'RE JUST DOING THE BEST WE CAN FOR YOU. WE'RE TRYING TO GET YOU IN AND OUT AND BACK WHERE YOU BELONG AT COUNTY HOSPITAL. ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA GET YOUR VALUABLES. WHERE I BELONG? I BELONG? I'M NOT GOING BACK TO THAT AWFUL PLACE! STOP HER. MOVE! I'M OKAY. WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON? DON'T MOVE. FREEZE! HOLD IT, LADY. PUT IT DOWN. PUT THE GUNS DOWN NOW! GET BACK. I SWEAR I'LL DO IT. LISTEN TO ME. NOBODY'S GONNA HURT YOU. NOBODY. ( alarm buzzing loudly ) NO, YOU LISTEN. ( alarm stops ) EVERYBODY LISTEN. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. BECAUSE NO ONE WILL LISTEN. WELL, YOU'RE GONNA LISTEN TO ME NOW OR I'LL OPEN THIS WRIST ALL OVER YOU. I'VE DONE IT ONCE; I'LL DO IT AGAIN. PLEASE, JUST TAKE A DEEP BREATH. THERE'S NO REASON TO DO ANYTHING DRASTIC. DRASTIC. HOW WOULD YOU KNOW? DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT? I JUST WANT SOMEBODY TO HEAR ME. WE HEAR YOU. EVERYBODY IS LISTENING. NO. NOBODY LISTENS. I TRIED TO TALK TO THEM, BUT THEY DON'T CARE. HOW CAN THEY CALL THEMSELVES A SCHOOL BOARD WHEN THEY DON'T TAKE THE TIME TO EDUCATE THEMSELVES? I TRIED. I TRIED TO TALK TO THEM, BUT THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY THAT I COULD GET MY POINT ACROSS TO THOSE PEOPLE. MISS SAVITA, THE BOARD WILL RECONVENE AT 3:00. I MEAN, ONCE THEY FOUND OUT THAT I WAS HIV-POSITIVE, I DISAPPEARED FROM THEIR WORLD. ONLY MY BLOOD, THIS SUBSTANCE, RUNNING THROUGH THE CHANNEL OF LIFE, COULD MAKE THEM OPEN THEIR EARS TO ME. DON'T MOVE OR I SWEAR, I'LL DO IT. BACK OFF, AMENDEZ. BACK OFF. IT'S ALL RIGHT, MA'AM. NOBODY'S GONNA HURT YOU. I'M NOT A MA'AM. I'M NICOLE SAVITA. I HAVE A NAME, I AM SOMEBODY. OF COURSE YOU ARE. I UNDERSTAND, NICOLE. ( giggles ) THIS IS KINDA SILLY, ISN'T IT? NO. NOT SILLY AT ALL. I'M JUST SO SICK OF STUPIDITY. IT'S SO EASY TO FIX IF YOU JUST LISTEN AND LEARN. I KNOW, I'M A TEACHER, A DARN GOOD ONE. I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT. "WHY HAVE MY SISTERS' HUSBANDS IF THEY SAY THEY LOVE YOU ALL? HAPPILY, WHEN I SHALL WED, THAT LORD WHOSE HAND MUST TAKE MY PLIGHT SHALL CARRY HALF MY LOVE WITH HIM, HALF MY CARE AND DUTY." BUT ONCE I REVEALED IT, WELL... SEE, I THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND BE HONEST. BUT IN MY HONESTY, I CEASED TO EXIST, AND PARENTS PULLED STUDENTS FROM MY CLASSROOM, AND FACULTY SHUT ME OUT, AND ULTIMATELY, THE SCHOOL BOARD OF KNOWLEDGEABLE EDUCATORS TOOK MY JOB. I'M SORRY TO INFORM YOU, BUT AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF DISCUSSION, WE'VE ALL CONCLUDED THAT, UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES, WE NO LONGER REQUIRE YOUR SERVICES. THEY TOOK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN MY LIFE. THEY TOOK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN MY LIFE. YOU SEE, I THOUGHT, UM... OKAY, I HAVE THE VIRUS. WHAT AN ASSET. I MEAN, ONCE YOU'VE GOT IT, HOW DO YOU USE IT? TO EDUCATE, AND WHO BETTER, MORE QUALIFIED? ME. A TEACHER, A SCULPTOR OF MINDS. WHAT A TOOL OF KNOWLEDGE I COULD BE. A VISUAL AID. NO, VISUAL AIDS. THE REAL THING. I COULD MAKE IT PART OF MY CURRICULUM, I COULD CREATE THIS WHOLE PROGRAM. BUT I WAS BANISHED. DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO ONLY TALK TO PEOPLE'S BACKS OR THE TOPS OF THEIR HEADS? YOU SEE? LIKE NOW. LOOK. YOU CAN LOOK AT ME. YOU CAN LOOK AT ME. I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU. I WOULD NEVER, I COULDN'T HURT YOU. I WOULD NEVER, I COULDN'T HURT YOU. OH, OKAY. WHY? HOW DID I GET IT? RIGHT. WHY? WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? WAS IT SEX, WAS IT DRUGS? WAS IT A TRANSFUSION? WHY DO PEOPLE WANNA KNOW? SO THEY CAN PUT ME IN A GROUP? AM I A DEVIANT, A DRUGGIE, OR A VICTIM? A CATEGORY, SO THEY CAN ANALYZE ME AND EVALUATE ME AND DECIDE HOW THEY SHOULD TREAT ME. WELL, YOU KNOW, THE POINT IS, ONCE IT'S THERE, IT DOESN'T MATTER. I'M PUMPING POISON. I LAY DOWN AT NIGHT, AND I'M VERY STILL, AND I CAN FEEL MY HEARTBEAT. AND I WISH THAT IT WOULD STOP, BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S RECYCLING A POLLUTED STREAM, AND I WANNA DIE. AND YET, I WANNA LIVE, 'CAUSE I WANNA TEACH. THAT'S THE ONLY THING I HAVE LEFT. GOD, I WAS TRAINED FOR THIS MOMENT. BUT PEOPLE STOPPED LISTENING TO ME, AND I CEASED TO EXIST. BUT PEOPLE STOPPED LISTENING TO ME, AND I CEASED TO EXIST. THIS IS THE PROOF THAT I'M HERE. I OPENED MY VEINS ON THE TABLE OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS SCHOOL BOARD SO THEY COULD SEE WHAT THEY FEAR, WHEN ALL THEY REALLY FEAR IS IGNORANCE. DON'T WORRY. I ALWAYS CARRY THIS WITH ME. AND A BOX OF BAND-AIDS. JUST IN CASE. I'M A VERY RESPONSIBLE PERSON, IF ALLOWED TO BE. I'M A VERY RESPONSIBLE PERSON, IF ALLOWED TO BE. I'M SAFE. THANK YOU. YOU HAVE VERY KIND EYES. THEY ALMOST SEEM ENLIGHTENED. THIS WAY. ( phone rings ) EIGHTH PRECINCT, DORIS. HOW MAY I HELP YOU? HEY, SEE YOU NEXT SHIFT, CHRISTINE. YOU BETCHA. I DON'T GET TO WORK WITH A ROOKIE TOO OFTEN. YOU MADE ME REMEMBER A LOT OF THINGS. WELL, THANKS FOR YOUR ADVICE. PRESSURE LETS UP WHEN YOU REALIZE YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE THE WORLD IN ONE DAY. DID I TEACH YOU THAT? BOY, AM I GOOD! ARE YOU HUNGRY? YEAH. I KNOW THIS DINER UP THE STREET. THEY SERVE PANCAKES, HASH BROWNS, THICK SLAB BACON. HOW ABOUT IT? THEY GOT OATMEAL? OATMEAL? YOU CAN GET OATMEAL ANYWHERE. I'M TALKIN' A FULL STACK OF PANCAKES, DRIPPIN' WITH BUTTER AND MAPLE SYRUP, SLAB BACON. I'M A VEGETARIAN. VEGETARIAN? YOU EAT RABBIT FOOD? COME ON. IF IT'S GOT A PULSE, I DON'T EAT IT. IF IT FLEES, I DON'T FOLLOW. WELL, THEY PROBABLY HAVE A BRAN MUFFIN.
