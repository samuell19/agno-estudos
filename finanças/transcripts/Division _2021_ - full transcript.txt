♪ It's a long dark way ♪ - I don't know what I'm doing here. I don't mean on Earth, but possibly that too. But more specifically, in Georgia. My fiance, Zach, said maybe we should leave Los Angeles, and I became obsessed with the idea. It was like I was impelled by a force beyond myself. So, tada, here I am, living in Atlanta. - There is so much happening right now in our country. - And now it'll go away like things go away. - It is unlikely that it's gonna disappear. - We are spending time fighting each other, when this virus doesn't understand politics and it's impacting us all. - Mayor Bottoms' mask mandate cannot be enforced. - The current president has cloaked American darkness for much too long. Too much anger, too much fear, too much division. - Knock the crap out of him, would you, seriously? This is for Trump. - I think my rhetoric is a very, it brings people together. - We ultimately agree far more often than we divide sharply. - I wanted a challenge, and now I've got one. And I knew Zach would be in the basement all the time recording werewolf porn audiobooks or whatever, and he is. And I am stuck in this house, and I might as well be totally alone. Except, not totally, because I have you, yay. Okay, bye. - Were using his words against him, and already he's trying to claim that somehow this is a different situation. - I just did a vlog. Are they even still called that? - Are you talking to me? - No, I'm talking to the dog. He's just as likely to answer. - You can see I'm doing something. - You were just on your phone. - Yes, doing something. Did you say you did a vlog? - Yep. - Why'd you do that? - I had to do something. - Do something. - Oh, did you hear that? The TV echoed me again. - That keeps happening to you. - I know. What does it mean? - The Democratic Party and the American people. - You're in touch with the universe. - I think so, babe. - But he isn't in elected office. I think it may come down to Senator Schumer-- - Are you going away? - Yep. - Have fun. Mysh, ooh, oh. What would I do without you, buddy? Oh. - Nice. - You watching porn? - Don't you think I'd have the door closed? - I don't know what you're into, man. - I just heard back from Andi, from Globe's Silliest Video. - Oh my God, you're still into that chick? - We're kinda friends. She writes me back sometimes. And she lives in Georgia now. - Oh, so you're gonna start stalking her now? - No. I'm not gonna stalk her. Mark, you're a dick. - Least I'm not a creepy ass stalker. - Shut the fuck up, dude. - You can find her address, you know? Yeah, you can find anything on the internet, mm-hm. - Now you sound like the creepy ass stalker. - No, man, I'm a tactical strategist. - Get the fuck out, tactical pervert. Come on. What else you doing? - He's got a point there. Uh. Hey, Mason. - Wow, hi. How are you? - I'm okay, you know, considering. - This is so weird. I've watched you on TV so much. - Oh, well, not much lately. What have you been up to? - Nothing now. I ... I lost my job because of this, this COVID bullshit. - Oh, I hear you, man, I'm sorry. Oh, so I like the pun in your handle, MaySin. Are you some kinda bad guy? - No, I'm the best guy. - Oh, really? That sounds like pride. That's one sin right there. - Wait till you hear about lust. - Oh my. - Being outta work, you know, I'm getting pretty good at sloth, too. - Oh yeah? Yeah, in the first couple months of this, I got deep into gluttony. - Did you put on a quaranfifteen? - It was more like quaranten. I was exercising every day, but I was balancing it out with lots of snacks. - I bet you looked adorable. - No, no, just lumpy. - Well , you look pretty damn good now. - Shucks, thank you. You're, you're awfully nice. - So you living in Atlanta now, huh? - Yep. - I live like an hour south of there in Elston. - Oh, I hear it's nice down there. - It's not. - I'm sorry. - It's all right. Just ... You know, I should come up there, and we should, we should have a beer. - Oh, yeah, if that's ever allowed again. - What? It's allowed. - Well, I mean, just because it's allowed doesn't mean it's a good idea. - Well Trump says don't let COVID ruin your life. - Are you being facetious? - Depends on what that means. - Yeah, well, I don't listen to much of what that guy has to say. - Yeah, me neither. So what brought you to the South then? - I'm not sure, insanity, maybe. - Maybe you were supposed to meet me. - Oh, yeah, that must be it. No, I'm afraid I am taken, but thank you. - You aint married. - Nope, engaged. - See, you can still get outta that. - You're cute, you're cute. But, no, I'm good, thank you. - You happy? - Yep. - Why you talking to me? - That's a good question. I don't know. You've been writing to me for years. You seem like a nice guy. - If you don't count all that sin. - Are you kidding? That's the best part. I mean, how long have you been writing to me now? It must be like 10 years. - Yeah, when I first saw you on the show, it was love at first sight. - Shut up. - Really. That show, you know, it, it saved my life. I got injured overseas. And I got home, I felt pretty lost and you all made me laugh. - Wow. Army? - Yeah. - Same as my grandpa. He was a radioman. - So was I. - No way. Come on. You know what, Mason? I'm sorry, I gotta go. - Well it was good talking to you. - It really was. Thank you. - For what? - I don't know. Reaching out, I guess. - Yeah, anytime. - Okay, have a good night. Bye. - Let's talk soon. Shit, she's gone. ♪ I didn't do anything wrong ♪ ♪ I was just talking to a friend ♪ - If they wanna vote properly, they can vote properly. - You want supper? - Yes, honey. - Just stop it with that shit, man. I aint your bitch. - You also aint paying rent. You gotta earn your keep somehow. - What the fuck? Mark, did you drink all the beer, bro? - Oops. - Are you kidding me right now? - Thought you weren't gonna drink during the week. - Aint no such thing as a weekend. I aint working. - I'm sorry. I will get more beer tomorrow, cool? - I gotta shop for my mom anyway, man. I'll just ... I'll get some then. - Still? Trump just said the virus is basically over. - Yeah. With her diabetes, you know, she's just, she's paranoid. - Survival of the fittest, man. - You are fucking talking about my mom! - I'm just telling it like it is. - Just telling it like it is? Fucking dick, man. You are a dick. - Chill the fuck out. If I needed somebody jumping down my throat every time I opened my mouth, I'd move back in with my wife. - As if she'd have you. Fucking asshole. - You believe this shit? - What? - They're trying to rig the election. - That's the only way they can win is to cheat. - It's a fucking left-wing coup is what it is. - Yeah, it's bullshit, all right. - Well they got another thing coming. This is what the Founding Fathers were talking about. - Hell yeah, they rolling over in the graves now. - A well-armed militia. We gotta fight this shit. The military's for Trump, the police. - Most of the generals are against him now. - Yeah, the generals might as well be politicians. I'm talking about the guys like you, and me. The ones who do the actual work. We need to take this fucking country back. - Yeah. - It sounds like desperation to me. - Hey, what is with you, man? - I just talked to that girl. - What girl? Oh, the girl from TV? - Andi. - Now you do know that you can't just pick girlfriends off the TV, right? It's not QVC for people. - She's different, Mark. It's not like she's, you know, famous. - You do know she is just some Hollywood libtard, don't you? - She lives here, though. - Where? - Atlanta. - Oh, Atlanta. I'll tell you what, Atlanta might as well be another planet. Might as well be New York Fucking City. - Still the South. - Seriously, is this the head injury? Are you fucking delusional? - We'll see. - You know, Mason, you could get all the pussy that you want. Girls love that with you, the dark, broody shit. - The girls around here are idiots. I want something different. - Well, be careful. Chicks get dangerous when they got brains. Trust me. - Since almost nobody is watching, I might as well be completely honest. I fucked up. I got to a certain point, and I didn't wanna work anymore. I couldn't work anymore, and, and I think that's humanity right there. The drive between wanting to strive for something more and the overwhelming urge to just sit back and let life happen to you. And let me tell you, living that way does not make you happy. If you let yourself be consumed by what happens to you instead of what you make happen, you will wake up one day and realize you are not a complete person. So that's where I'm at. Andi James, partial person, signing off. Hi, Mama. - Hi, hon, how you doing today? - I'm fine, how are you? - You sound down. - Yeah, I'm feeling feckless. I am utterly devoid of feck. - What's going on? - Nothing, that's the problem. - You know, you wouldn't feel this way if you had a baby. - Yeah, Mom, I don't think it's a good idea to have a baby just because you're bored. - I just don't want you to regret not having one. It's the natural order. - I don't know if it is anymore I mean, look what's going on in the world. What if I had a kid and he wound up in some Mad Max water war or something? - Yeah, but what if your baby ended up in a water war but saved everybody? Like your baby was the hero. - Okay, Mom, yeah. Clearly my delusions of grandeur are hereditary. Have you forgotten Zach had a vasectomy? - They can be reversed. It's expensive. It's like $10,000. - Oh my God. - I'll pay. - Okay. You're cute. - Your baby would be cute. - I am sad I won't make you a grandma. You'd be a really great grandma. - I would. - Yeah, no, that's not a good enough reason to have a baby either, Mom, okay. - Okay, fine. Be that way. - Okay, I love you. - I hope you feel better. - Thank you, bye. Oh. What fresh hell have we come upon today? - What? Oh. It's fucking insane. Piece of shit's trying to rig the election. - Oh yeah, well, cheating's the only way they can win. - He'll literally do anything to stay in power. It's so bad. - So, apocalypse notwithstanding, what do you think? Untie your tubes? - Yeah, no thanks. - Yeah, I know. You know, if you don't wanna have a baby, there are like four guys on the internet that totally love me. I could give one of them a call. - Fans of Globe's Silliest? - Yeah. - You know they're all Trump supporters? - Shut up, you don't know that. - Only Trumpers would be stupid enough to like that show. - Oh my God, you're such an elitist. A lot of people liked that show. - Yeah, a lotta dumb people. Stop it! - There you go. - Thank you. - Keep your tab open? - Yeah, appreciate it, thanks. Mm, here you go. - Thank you. - You got it. Should we take these off? - I think so. It's kinda hard to drink beer with them on. - Yeah, that's a good point. Oh my God, this feels so dangerous. - Because it is. - Exciting. - God, it feels so good to get outta the fucking house. - Oh, seriously, I was going crazy. This guy keeps asking me to go get a beer, and I was like, okay fine, I'll go get a beer. - Just not with him? - Exactly. I'll get one with Delaney. - Mm. So, who is this guy? - It's no one, just this fan. - You're blushing. - He's actually super cute. - Oh really? - Yeah, and really charming. - Uh oh. - I know. We definitely had like a vibe going. I don't usually like Southern accents, but he sounds like honey tastes. - Uh, yummy. - I know. - You are totally gonna go on a date with a fan. You are so famous. - Shut up. I am only fame-ish. - Ah, give it time. - I think that ship has sailed. But you I have hope for. - Yeah, right, nobody wants to hire me. I'm such a self-conscious freak. - What? - Oh, nothing, I'm just pretty sure we're the same person. Except I'm older. Maybe I was sent from the future to help you. - Ooh, help me with what? - I don't know, not be a self-conscious freak? Because you're awesome. - Well isn't it funny because the only place I don't feel like a self-conscious freak is when I'm on stage, in front of strangers. - It's too bad there's no such thing as a show anymore. - Oh, it'll come back. - I'm not so sure. - You think theater is done? - I think this country might be. - Yeah, maybe. - I'm so glad I sat next to you at that show last year, though. - God, me too. I love you. - Ah! - Is it too soon to say that? - No, girl, I love you too. I haven't had a connection with someone like this in a really long time. - What about your fiance? - Huh. I'm not sure we ever had that. - Andi, why are you marrying him? - Well, we have been engaged for almost four years. - Okay. - Okay, so, we were on and off forever because I kept leaving him for other guys. - Okay. - But I always came back to him. It's not this deep soul connection, but we're a really good match, we balance each other. - Mm, God, sounds so romantic. Like a scale. - Well I am a Libra. - I knew it. I'm a Capricorn. We make a good match. - See that? Bam. - Bam. So, do you love Zach? - Yeah. - But you're not in love with him? - I am. - You sound super convincing right now. - I know. I feel like I'd be totally happy if he just connected with me more. Or did it with me more. - How often do you guys do it? - Like every other week, if I am lucky. - Um, no, that is not enough. - I know. But maybe I have unreasonable expectations, you know. My grandma once told me she thought that what I was looking for didn't exist. - Ouch. - Yeah. - Well, you shouldn't settle, Andi. - I think we all have to settle, honestly. Guys are just inherently disappointing. - Ugh. Maybe you're right. Even Sally settled a little for Harry. - What about you? Are you settling with your dude? - He's the worst. - This is a major scandal. This is a scandal the likes of which nobody's ever seen. This is actually the biggest political scandal in the history of our country. - Ma? - In here! - I love what you're doing with the place. The kitchen looks like shit but ... - I heard that. - I'm gonna clean up a little bit. - Leave my kitchen alone and bring me a quarter. - Come here. Hi, Ma. - Where's your mask? - Don't start that now again. - Fauci says we should wear a mask. - Fauci's a fucking idiot. - Mouth. - Sorry, ma'am. - In the jar. - Mom, you know I can't afford your jar right now. I aint working. - Well you could, if you would stop cussing. You get that from your father. He was a sailor, and they're supposed to curse. - And they don't curse in the Army, huh? - And you were in the Army for what, about five minutes? Did you get my Ding Dongs? - Shouldn't be eating that stuff, Ma. - Did you get them? - Yes. - Bring me one. - Daddy's birthday's coming up. How old would he have been? - 67. He could finally retire, if he could ever hold a job. - Come on, Ma. - How you doing with your drinking? - Oh yeah, you know, I barely drink now. - Yeah. You get that from him too. - We gonna do this every time I come over here? Because, you know, I could, I could just have these groceries delivered. - No, no. I'm sorry, Mason honey. You just sit right there. - Six feet. - You brat. - Here. - Thank you. I don't know if I can vote for this guy again. - What are you gonna do, vote Democrat? - He lies all the time. Lies and brags. - He's the only one telling the truth, Ma. - Mason, he said the corona would be over by Easter. - It's not his fault. It's China's fucking fault. - Mouth! In the jar. - I'm sorry, but you talking crazy, Ma. - I don't know. People at church said that Trump was sent by God, but sometimes I wonder if he didn't come from ... - You still going to church? - Of course. - Why am I getting your groceries every week if you're still going to church. - Because you are a good son. - Oh, I see. Ah. It could be dangerous, Ma. You're already sick. - Mason, I am washed in the blood of Jesus. That is all I need. - Lotta people get COVID at church, Ma. - I didn't think you even believed in the COVID. - Old people die of COVID. You, are an old people. - Well then I guess it'll just be God's plan, won't it? - Oh you wanna talk about God's plan, do you? And then you wanna go vote for the baby killers. - Trump is trying to get rid of Obamacare. If I lose that, I can't afford my medicines. - Well, if you wanna become a socialist then, why don't you just get your own groceries? - Well if I was a socialist, the government would get me my groceries. - Maybe they'll get you a new son too. - And that aint funny. And don't joke like that, Mason. - I'm sorry, Ma. - You're the last thing I got left. - I aint going nowhere. - Election integrity. In Brooklyn, 25% of mail-in ballots were ruled invalid in June's Democrat primary. You saw that. - Ugh. Make him go away. - I just hope we can. - Biden's leading in all the polls, right? - Yeah, well, so was Hillary. - Good point. - I mean, he's totally laying the groundwork to try and invalidate the election. - Jesus. - And these freaking Republicans just roll over for him. - And he even says all the tough guys are on his side. That's like the last dying gasp of toxic masculinity. - Mm-hm. I just hope they don't take us all down with them. - Yeah. - Oh, did you have fun on your lady date? - So much fun. She's awesome. You know, even if nothing else happens, it was worth the move just to make this good a friend. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Oh. What, is she like your soulmate? - Maybe. Chick edition. - Well, yeah, because I'm your soul man. - Peepers, meow. - Okay, gotta work. - Are you serious? I just got home. - Sorry, I've got a deadline. - You always have a deadline. You should be happy one of us is working. - Truce. - Ooh. I'll be back up in a bit to make dinner. - Okay, babe. I love you. - Mm. - They can't run a simple caucus, yet now they're trying to-- - So I called my dad for his birthday a couple of weeks ago, and uh, he hasn't called me back. Oh great, and now my dog's leaving too. I can't keep a man around here. But, yeah, Dad and I have always had a difficult relationship. But I keep trying. I have visited him twice in the last 15 years. He has never visited me. It just, it just sucks. Zach says I should cut him off completely, but I guess he's already done that with me. Oh, and this is funny. When I was growing up, my dad was in the basement all the time, and now, so is my fiance. Freud is weird, huh? Um, if you see this, Dad, give me a call, for crying out loud. Geesh. Mysh, you wanna go for a walk? Come on, buddy. - All night, all night. Look at that. - Shut the fuck up, Yolanda! - Showing that lily-white ass! She's walking that dog every day, every day, every damn day walking by here. - Hey, Aya. - Hey, how you doing? Why he always barking at me? Is it because I'm Black? - Oh my God, no. - Mm-hm. Because guess what, Mysh, you black too. - No, he's just a jerk. He barks at Zach all the time. Shut up. - Mm-hm. Hey, grab my mail. - Oh, sure. Mm, that smells good. - Mm-hm, how you doing, girl? Come sit down. - Here's your mail. - Thank you. You want some? - Um, okay. Oh, I don't think we should share the same pipe, though. - Oh. I got another pipe. - Okay. Can't argue with that. - Here you go. Be careful, though, that there's zaza. - Okay, okay. - Yolanda giving you shit? - I don't know. It's kind of hard to tell if she is muttering to herself or at me. - Yeah, you know I caught them stealing my electricity. - Are you serious? - Yeah. - They use our water hose. They keep forgetting to turn it off. - That was nice of y'all. - Yeah, well, our water bill was three times higher last month. - Pfft. Yeah, you know the guy grew up there. He just never left when his mama died. - I heard that. It's really said. - Dangerous is what it is. They almost burnt us both down. - You know they hadn't even called the fire department? Thank God we got home in time. - They are tough. I could not live like that. - Oh, hell no. Mm. - You've been through some shit, though. I can tell. You and I been through some real nigga shit, am I right? - I mean, well, I wouldn't use those words, but yeah, I know what you mean. - How long you say you been living here now? - Like a year and a half, but I don't think the last few months count. - For real. You like it? - I love it. The vibe here is just much better than LA. - You sound LA, talking about vibes and shit. - That's true. I'm actually from New York, though. - Where at? I got people up there. - Oh yeah? I grew up on Long Island, and then I lived in Brooklyn and Manhattan. - Brooklyn? Where at in Brooklyn? - 11th Street and Third Avenue. - When was this? - Late '90s. - Girl, woof, you just love living in the hood, don't you? - Yeah maybe. Me and my friends were the worst thing about the neighborhood, though. No, we would have these all-night parties, and oh my God, our guy friends would go out tagging everything. It was so bad. - Okay, Jenny from the block. - How about you? How long have you lived here? - My whole life. Yeah, my mama grew up here. - Oh wow, that's cool. - Yep. It's a lotta history in this neighborhood. You know the civil rights basically started here? - Yeah, I read a lot about it before we moved. I actually feel kinda bad now. - Why's that? - Like maybe we weren't respecting the history of the neighborhood when we moved here. - Oh. You protest this summer? - No, but I wanted to. I wanted to, but I was scared of the virus. How about you? - Hell no. Fuck that shit. It aint like nothing gonna change. - You don't think things are different this time? I mean, nothing's gonna change until this asshole is out of office, but ... - That don't matter. They all the same. - No, Aya, one side is definitely worse than the other. - Andi, they are all the same, trust me. - Oh my God, Aya, you are breaking my heart. - Girl, all the political shit is bullshit. - I am gonna make you change your mind. - I don't need you walking in here trying to be some white savior. - Okay, you're right. - Bad enough you gentrify our shit. - I know. I'm sorry. - Gentrify Brooklyn, Atlanta. You gentrify LA too? - Yes. Yes, I did. Hm. There were just all these signs that we were supposed to be here so, here we are. - Here you are. At least your dog is black. - Oh, you're a good boy. Who's a good boy? It's you. Definitely you. I've just had a crazy talk with Aya. - Oh yeah? - She got me high. - Look at you. - Do you think we're jerks for moving here? - To Atlanta? - No, to this neighborhood. - Why, because it's Black? - Yes, are we asshole gentrifiers? - Maybe, but you love the house, and it's a nice neighborhood. - Except for next door. Yolanda was saying something about lily-white ass. - About you? - Do you see any other lily-white asses around? I just feel like we might be intruding. Sometimes I feel like I'm intruding with you. - What? - You gonna watch the debate with me tonight? - I don't need to see that. Why are you gonna watch it? You'll just get upset. - I can't look away. It's like a clown car car crash. - I lost my dad, when I was a kid. And my brother. To the same accident. Yeah, I read that. In some interview with you. Yeah. - Investing in crypto, today's hottest market. It's your turn. You can invest in crypto too. What are you waiting for? Call now. - Oh, yes, yes, yes! Yes. He's cute. - You talking to me? - Nope. No, I am not. - Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, woo! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Trump, Trump, Trump! Mark! - What the fuck are you doing, man? - You can suck my dick. That's what I'm doing. - No thanks. - Whoa! - Always knew you were a fag. - I'm a fag who got a date with Andi James. - Are you serious? - I sure as shit am. - I'll be. - There is a God. - You better calm the fuck down or else you're gonna blow your load the moment she says hello. - I should probably pregame, huh? - You use your one for the month, huh? Huh? - No. - Huh? - Fucking Muslims do that no jerking off shit, Mark. - Listen, it conserves your power and it keeps you sharp, okay? - It makes you crazy is what it does. - Well you don't need any help with that now, do you? - Are you fucking serious right now? Mark! - Calm down, okay, okay, I'm happy for you. I am, I am. You bang that TV chick. You deserve it. - Debate's tonight, right? - Can't wait to see Donnie kill that old fuck, huh? - Proud Boys, stand back and stand by-- - Holy shit. - Did you fucking hear that? Oh, it's on now! Fuck, I told you, man. I fucking told you. Do you know what this means? - Yeah, I do. - The world is ending, right? Kinda seems like the world is ending. Here's the thing, I've always felt like this was gonna happen. And, I've always felt like, I'm supposed to stop it. Here's a little background for you. I used to do a lot of acid. I don't recommend it, kids. I see you. But all my trips kinda wound up being about the end of the world, and I would also think that I was some kind of god. Or like, a god. And this is funny because, I always thought if I had a daughter I would name her after my sister, who passed away. Her name was Jennifer, but she didn't even like that name so I thought I would call her Genevieve, which in French is kind of like Jen Lives. Which is cool, right? And then one night, I was outside, looking at the sky and talking to Jen and I see that the constellation of Orion is flashing. My mom saw it too. I am not completely out of my mind. You know, I am, but not about that. So then I thought I'd name my daughter Genevieve Orion, which I think is so beautiful. But then I get it into my head that I'm gonna marry someone whose last name starts with a D. Okay, because then Genevieve's initials would be G-O-D. - Holy shit. Mark! Mark! - I could be like the mother of God. - Mark! - But I'm getting old, my fella's snipped-- - Mark! - What? - Check this shit out. Man, I told you. I fucking told you. - What the shit? - I'm gonna marry someone whose last name starts with a D. - Listen, right here. - Because then Genevieve's initials would be G-O-D. - What the shit? - If I'm not God, I could be like the mother of God or something. - Did you see that? - Yeah, it's fucking blasphemy, man. - My last name's Dennis. We supposed to be together. - I told you. - Okay, buddy. Don't invite me to the wedding. Or, you know what, do invite me and I'll stand up when they ask if anyone objects. - You gonna be standing already, because you gonna be my best man. - Not for this bitch. - You serious right now? - Am I serious? Are you fucking serious? You haven't even met this girl yet. I'm seriously starting to get worried about you. - Well don't. Good grief. I'm gonna make this happen, man. You'll see. - Okay, buddy, I'll meet you there. - I'm meeting her tonight. - Tonight? Are you retarded or just stupid? The judge called for a fucking meeting tonight. - Meeting's at 10. I'm meeting her at six. - Oh. Guess you don't figure on getting lucky, huh? - She aint like that. - You don't know her! You don't know what she's like. You get that? - I just know. - Jesus. - Andi James. - Mason ... I don't know your last name. - It's Dennis, starts with a D. - You watched my video. - Yeah, of course. Pretty wild, eh? - It's pretty wild, all right. - Uh, let me get you a beer. - Sure, you having an amber? - Yeah, yeah, they, they really good. - Okay, I'll have one of those, thanks. What am I doing? What am I doing? - It's really old, though. - Hey, excuse me, darling. Can you get me two ambers please? What? - Gotta wear a mask, man. - I'm fine. Just get me the fucking beer. - I don't know that. I can't serve you without a mask. Oh, he has one. - I don't even know how to fucking wear the thing, lady. It's great. Is that better, baby? Run a tab, if you don't mind. Thanks, darling. - And it's not darling, by the way, it's Kara. - Run me a tab, Kara, if you don't mind. I bet you'd come to anything. There you are, milady. - Thank you. Are you a knight? - You can't see my shining armor? - I can see you are a shining charmer. - Shit, you're funny. Good grief. - Yeah, it's kinda my thing. Mm. I thought you would have tattoos. You seem like a tattoo guy. - Yeah, I probably would be, but I think my Mama would kill me. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Are you tight with your mom? - Yeah, real tight. - Yeah, me too. I think sharing loss'll do that. - I think my mama probably shouldn't have married my daddy anyway. - Why not? - I usually save that till the second date. - This isn't a date, though. - Okay. - What? It's not. - What is it then? - Two friends having a beer. - Two friends who are wildly attracted to each other? - I never said I was attracted to you. - You don't have to. What'd your friend say over here? - Oh, oh my God. - Oh, you nail that hot fan, girl. Your friend is smart. - Okay, she is kidding. - I'm not. I'm not. - Oh my God. - Not even close. You got any tattoos? - No. I always think I wanna get one for my sister, though. - Oh yeah. You should. You should. Or you could, you could just get my name. - Oh, oh yeah? Where? - Yeah, on your butt, like a Cabbage Patch Kid. Or, you could wait and just get our kids' names. - Oh, okay. You don't think we're getting a little old for that? - Oh no. Maybe. We should probably get started. - You are pretty sure of yourself, huh? - I never been so sure about anything in my whole damn life. - Wow. - That video you did, you know, about being half a person? - Yeah. - I know what you mean. I always felt like I coulda been so much more, like I was a really good musician. And I just, I just could never get it together. - Hm. What did you play? - Guitar, sing. - You're a front man, huh? - Oh yeah. - I could see that. - I blew it, though. I blew it. - How? - Drinking. - Oh. - Not following through on shit, you know? - Yeah, I know. I don't know why it's so hard to make the most of yourself. - That's true. - I'll bet you were good, though. I could see it in you. - How's that? - Just what you went through. I think pain makes power, and it either drives you forward or consumes you. - Oh, it definitely consumed me. - Yeah, me too. - Whew. And then, then, 9/11 happened, and, uh, I enlisted. - I think that's really noble. - No, it is what it is. - You could still play music. - I can't, though. TBI, in Afghanistan. - I don't know what that is. - Traumatic brain injury. Left me, uh, it left me ... I just never could bring myself to play anymore. - I'm so sorry, Mason. - Everything happens for a reason, though, right? - Sometimes I'm not so sure about that. - Well, if it ... If it led me to being here with you, then I'm okay with it. - Mason, you are something else. Ah. - You know when my mom married my daddy, her family basically disowned her. - Why? - Well, you know, they were super evangelical, and he, he was this, he was this atheist guy. - Wow, how does that work? - You don't believe people who are different can love each other? - I think it makes things hard. I mean, I wouldn't wanna be with someone who thought I was going to hell. - Why, you don't believe in God? - I believe, I believe in something. I just, I don't know, I don't know what it is. - That's a copout. - Okay, maybe, maybe, but isn't it hubris to say you're so sure of something when you don't have any proof? - No, it's not hubris, it's faith. I mean, come on, isn't it proof enough that our calendar is literally divided before and after Christ? - That's not proof. That's good PR. - Oh, you are going to hell. You are going to hell, lady. Whoa. - Yeah, no, I might be. That's true. But it'll be for many many other reasons. - Why do you say that? - I was a really bad kid. - Me too. - Yeah? Yay, bad kids. - How were you bad? - Well, lying, cheating, stealing, drugs. All the good stuff. - You don't do that stuff no more? - Mm, I am morally unimpeachable. I mean, I still smoke pot sometimes, but, like, no, not the way I used to. It got bad. - Oh, man. - Why were you bad? - I think just, you know, when my daddy and my brother died. I just went a little crazy. - You said it was an accident, right? - Yeah. My daddy was driving me and my brother, and he was drunk off his ass. That kinda accident. - Oh my God, you were in the car? - Yeah. - Mason, that's awful. - Yeah, it fucking sucked. You know, my brother, he ... He was awesome. - Yeah? - Yeah, he was ... You know, I always felt like it ... I always felt like it shoulda been me. - Yeah, I've felt that way about my sister too. - We got lots in common, me and you. - Yeah, so it seems. So are you still crazy? - Oh, totally. - Yeah, yeah, me too. - My mom, she says, she says you gotta find somebody who matches your crazy. - I have also said that. - I really wanna kiss you right now. - Mason, I can't do that. - Why? Why not? Because of COVID or your fiance? - Both. - But they's something here, Andi. There is something here. I know you feel it. - I mean, yeah, maybe, but we don't really know each other. You know, I have been distracted by the shiny new thing before, and, it never works. - Until it does. - I should go. - Okay. Let me, let me walk you to your car. - No, no, you shouldn't. - Why not? - Because I don't wanna be tempted to kiss you goodnight. - But you're tempted, though. You're tempted. - All right. - She's tempted. - Good night, Mason. - Good night. - I had fun. - Me too. - And now they want us to-- - Is it on? - Sh. - Treat minorities as equals. They want us to let whatever vermin that wants to come into the country. They want us to call men in dresses she or her, or whatever the fuck. No fucking way. Since the beginning of time, the white man has been in charge on this Earth, and Donald J. Trump was sent by God Himself to make sure it stays that way. Now he needs us. The deep state is trying to take him down, and we're not gonna let that happen. We're the ones with the weapons, and we're the ones that know how to use them. Get ready, brothers. This is what we've been waiting for. Stay tuned. - Fuck yes. It's about time. - Wow, is he really a judge? - Yes, some circuit or something. He's a friend of my dad's, such a badass. - Huh. Yeah. - What's your problem now? Wait, you scared? - No, Mark, I aint scared. - You are, aren't you? You're a secret snowflake, aren't you? Is Mason scared? Does Mason's pussy hurt, huh? - Shut the fuck up, Mark. Shit. God. - Seriously, man, what is it? - It's just that ... I don't think Andi's on our side. - So I guess your little date went well, huh? - Yeah. - What the fuck's it matter? - 'Cause, I think we're supposed to be together. - Oh, man, that is some insane shit. You realize that? - What? You don't believe in fate? - No. No, I fucking don't. That is some hippie bullshit. What, you really think that this TV bitch is gonna fall in love with you? - Yeah, maybe. - What is she, 40? She's not married yet. She's probably some fucking feminazi. Bitch should have kids by now. - Maybe she's been waiting for me. I think I've been waiting for her. - Whatever. You sound like a lunatic. - Fuck you, Mark. - I bet she doesn't even cook. - I can cook. - Oh, you can cook, huh? What, are you gonna cook for her? You gonna clean too? Why don't you wear the fucking dresses while you're at it, huh? - You know what? You, you are a piece of shit. - Well, at least I'm a man-shaped piece of shit, Mason. - Oh, I aint a man? - I don't think so. You're a fucking little bitch. - Oh, really? - No. - How about that eye right there? I'm gonna dot it right now, bam! - Ooh, motherfucker. It's on.

No, he won't, actually. - Oh I'll definitely be there. - Holy shit! - What, what? What, what? - Trump has COVID. - Oh my God. - Oh my God, I ... Ah, I feel kinda bad celebrating that. - Why? - Yeah, I don't know. That's some karmic shit right there. Whew. - We're gonna have to start believing in God. Babe? Babe, you okay? Okay, we don't have to believe in God. - Talk about karma. - Maybe you have COVID too. - I guess I should take a test. - Or you're pregnant. - Shut up. My period is a couple weeks late. - Are you serious? - Yeah, but I'm old. It gets further apart. - Did you cheat on me, with that fan guy? - What? Babe, no, never. - Oh my God. I just said I was gonna put a baby in you. - Honey, it doesn't happen that fast? It would be from before. - I mean, it does happen sometimes, even with a vasectomy. - Shut up. We're being ridiculous. I'll take that test too, though. - If you were ... - We'd have to keep it, right? - I think so. - Ah! - Goddam, nice one. I outranked you. How come you're such a better shot than I am? - You only outranked me because you went to college. Can you cool it with the God swears, Mark? - Jesus Fucking Christ, you big pussy. You know, I never understood why you didn't go to college. You're a pretty smart guy for a fucking idiot. - Andi didn't go to college. Put that down, Mark. That aint fucking funny. - I swear to God I will pull the fucking trigger if I hear her name one more time. - She's doing a call-in show tomorrow night. You oughta watch with me. - Why the hell would I wanna do that? - See how cool she is. - All right, look, Mason. You and I, we go way back. Your brother was my best friend, so the way I see it, you're like my brother. - You fucking leveling with me now right here? - Yeah, I am. Because I have not seen you like this high school, when you were all torn up over that, what's her fuck? - It aint fucking like that, dude. It's not fucking like Leah. - Yeah, you know what it's like? You almost killed yourself over that bitch, okay. Where is she now? - I don't know. She's not on social media. - Listen, man. You can't give women that much power, man. You gotta show them who's boss. Hm? Cuck, cuck, Jew. Got it. You got any more bullets left? - Yeah, a couple. - Well, we best stock up. Election Day's coming. - Winter's coming, bang. - Yeah, perfect for hunting snowflakes. - Hello, Mama. Uh-huh, well, you're not gonna believe it. - Hi, Andi. How's it going? - Dude, are you dressed up to be on the computer? - Yes. - You are such a bitch I cannot even handle it. - Shut the fuck up, man. It's starting. - Nice shirt. - You're an asshole every day of your life, Mark. - Just fucking bring it on. - Hey, kids, and welcome to The Shit Show, Delaney's Dojo. I'm open to new names. I just would like to give a warm welcome to my first guest tonight. I used to watch her make jokes on Globe's Silliest Videos, and then one day she sat randomly next to me in the theater. It was magical, and her name is Andi James! - Hey, everybody. - Hey, girl, what's up? How are you? - Oh you know, totally amazing. - Oh, really? - Well, no, the world is garbage right now. - Truly. Really. What are you doing to get through it? - Drugs. - Hm. - I'm just kidding. - Isn't she cute? - Not particularly. - But lately I've been mostly binging cable news. - Oh, that sounds so healthy. - Yeah, I'm sure it is. - What's your poison? - Okay, I never used to get political online because a lot of my fans are on the other side, but I no longer think it's acceptable to be silent. I think we have to do whatever we can to get this man out of office. - I fucking told you, man. - So blue news. - Oh, yeah, you know it. It is so nice to hear people that are smarter than you putting your frustrations into words. - Yeah yeah, it's validating. - It is. - Yeah. - It is. But seriously, I honestly think that this country is done if he gets in again, like possibly the whole world. - I totally agree. - She's an idiot. It's the liberals that are ruining the country. - I don't know what to do. I do not know what to do. - You tell her off, humiliate her ass. - Nothing feels like enough, you know? I don't know what I'm supposed to do, but I feel like I'm supposed to do something. - Yeah. Well, do y'all wanna talk politics with us? Or something a little less upsetting? Come on, get in that room. Chat with us. Let's go. - Is there even anyone out there? - One. We have one person. - Oh, we're popular. - Oh, so popular. Okay, okay, we got Mason. You're on, Mason. - Is this Mason D? - How could you fucking do this? - What? What did I do? - Wow, is this the Mason from the other night? - What did I do? - Trump is saving this country. And you liberals just trash him all the time. - Okay, buddy, yeah, time to go. - No no, no, wait, I wanna talk to him. - He's in a cult. Why bother? - No, you're the cult! - Listen, honey, let me just-- - Hey, don't call me honey! - Okay, okay. - You're such fucking sheep, all of you. - Isn't it more sheepy to blindly follow a man that has told 30,000 verifiable lies in office? That has bankrupted seven companies, who cheats on his taxes and his wives. He's a total fraud. - It's all fake news! - Look, Mason, I get it. I do. You like Trump. He makes you feel good. He's exciting. What is he gonna do next? He believes the things that you believe, and you're allowed to believe those things but you can't tell us it's not okay to believe what we believe. That people are equal and sometimes need a little help. That you can get sick and not go broke. That people can love who they wanna love and be who they wanna be? What is your problem with that? You all hate us so much you wanna kill us. What are you gonna do, like attack all the polling places in Democrat areas? You think that you'll get away with that? You think that won't escalate? You are so against things changing, against progress that you are willing to end the world. - We don't want the world to end. - No, you just want women to be subservient and forced into giving birth and queer people to go back in the closet and people of color to be subjugated. Well, we're not doing that anymore, okay. That's not gonna work. This is progress. This is evolution. Oh, I'm sorry. You probably don't believe in evolution. - You know what? Fuck you. You have no idea what it's like down here. I mean, half of my town is on heroin or meth. There's no work. You know, I, I try to get a sanitation job, and they had to give it to some fucking N-- - Hey! - No! - Mason, Jesus Christ. - I scored higher on the test! You tell me how that's fair? - Okay, Mason, I can see how that seems unfair, but if you take into account years of systemic racism-- - You're not listening, to me! You all never listen. You just think you're so smart and that you know everything. Easy. Your side. They kill babies. - Mason, I have had an abortion. - What? - And it was one of the best choices I ever made. - You're nothing but a dirty whore. - Okay, okay, thank you for making my decision for me. - To think I loved you. - You don't even know me. - You're just another disgusting baby-killing slut. - Okay, that's enough. Thank you. Good luck with your civil war. - Fuck you! - Goodbye. - Okay, all right, that, all right. Whew. Well that was nice. Tune in next time to Delaney's Dial-In. See what kinda drama ensues next. - Oh, I like that name, yeah. - Right? It's a good one. - Sounds nice. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - Ho. - Oh my God, I'm shaking. - Are you okay? - Oh. - I guess you won't be seeing him again. - Uh, yeah, no. - I need to talk to her, Mark. - Why? She made a fool outta you, Mason. - She knows. She knows what we're planning. You tell me how she knows. - She doesn't know shit, okay? She is talking out of her ass. - Yeah. I still need to talk to her. - You are so fucking twisted by this cunt. I can't even fucking talk to you. - Hey, everybody. Wow, I see I have a lot of new viewers. Welcome. I'm guessing a lot of you saw that video of me fighting with the Trump guy that went viral. And speaking of Trump going viral, hey. No, I mean, of course, I send him thoughts and prayers. But it's funny because I never used to get political online, but I think this happened for a reason. I think that I'm here, like the whole reason I am on this planet, is to stop Donald Trump. I don't know how. I mean, do I challenge him to a fistfight? I don't know. So until I figure that out, I'll just keep doing what I'm doing and hope that it all becomes clear. Until then, thanks for watching and resist, bitches. Oh God, that was stupid. I'm sorry. - Hey, man. I guess you're going to the Uprising meeting. - Yeah, I'm going over to Eric's to watch it. - Can I come with? - You are no longer welcome. - Excuse me. - You are a liability to this movement. Your face was all over the fucking place in that video. - Oh, you're the one told me to go after her. - Authorities know you now. They're probably watching you, for fuck sake. - Oh, come on, Mark. Really. I mean, talk to them. You've gotta let me back in. - I don't think you can win back that trust, honestly. - Win back that trust? But ... You're like my brother. - Yeah, I don't know anymore. I'm giving you notice. You got till the end of the month to get out. - What? Fuck you doing to me, man? - You did this to yourself, Mason! Look at you! You're a fucking mess! Over a girl, a fucking girl! - We're supposed to be together. Get off me! What are you doing? - Put you outta your misery. - Mark. - You try me. - Mark, don't you do that. You think of Mom, man. She needs me. Put the fucking gun down, Mark! - You take one more step, I swear to God, Mason. - Then do it then. Just fucking do it. - You are fucking pathetic. - Mark, come on! - Oh, I feel really gross. - Did you take that test? - Oh, right. Shit. What do I do with this? - Fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck! - Zach! - Hey, Ma. - Hello, my son. - Wait, what are you doing? Where are you? Hold on. I'm pulling over. Mom, are you in the hospital? Why didn't you call me? - Honey, I was lucky I was able to call 911. - Where are you? I'll come, I'll come right now. - You can't come in. I've got COVID. They won't let anybody in. - Come on, Mom. COVID's bullshit, now. - You owe me a quarter, young man. - Probably just your pneumonia acting up again. - No, Mason. - I told you to stop going to church. - At least I know my soul was right with the Lord, which is more than I can say for you and that mouth of yours. - Stop it, Ma. You're gonna be fine. Stop it. - That's why I'm calling, Mason. They're about to put a ventilator in. - No. Ma, Ma, no no. Let me-- - Mason. - No, listen. - Listen, just let me get there. Let me come. Let me, tell them to wait. - It's okay, honey. You know I love you more than anything, but you're gonna be okay. - No, Ma, don't worry about me. - Find a nice girl, okay? - I did, Ma. I'm on my way to see her right now. You're gonna love her. You're really gonna love her, I know it. - Oh, that does my heart good, Mason. You know I love you more than anything. - I love you too, Ma, so much. - I don't know how to say goodbye. - No. Ma, we ... We don't have to say goodbye. You gonna be fine. You gonna be able to hug your grandkids someday. - That's a nice thought. So, I'll just say see you later. - You're a hoot, you know. You're a hoot. I'll see you later, Ma. All right? I love you. Ma. Ma. Ma. Ma. - The number you have dialed does not accept incoming calls. - Oh God. No! No! - So things have been really crazy. I know you're not supposed to talk about it this early, but I am pregnant. And my fiance had a vasectomy, and I didn't cheat on him. So, basically, there is a little miracle going on inside of me. I guess I'm getting my Genevieve Orion after all, huh? Life is nuts. It is just nuts. Speaking of which, send pistachios. It is the only thing I wanna eat lately. Okay, love to all y'all. Bye. - And now people are dying. This man has run our country into the ground. - Come on, Mysh, it's time to go. - It's time to go. - Oh. Did you hear that? Did you hear that? That's crazy. That is crazy. What is that about? - And let me tell you, it is more of the same.
