[ "Oh, What A Beautiful Morning" ] [ "The Farmer And The Cowman"] [ "People Will Say We're In Love" ] [ "Oh, What A Beautiful Morning" ] [ "People Will Say We're In Love" ] [ "Oklahoma"] [ "The Surrey with the Fringe on Top"] There's a bright golden haze on the meadow There's a bright golden haze on the meadow The corn is as high as an elephant's eye And it looks like it's climbin' clear up to the sky Oh, what a beautiful morning Oh, what a beautiful day I got a beautiful feeling Everything's goin' my way [Birds Chirping] All the sounds of the earth are like music All the sounds of the earth are like music The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree And a ol' weepin' willer is laughin' at me Oh, what a beautiful morning Oh, what a beautiful day I got a beautiful feeling Everything's goin' my way Oh, what a beautiful day [ Rooster Crows ] [Chickens Clucking ] - Hi, Aunt Eller! - Don't scare me to death. - What you doin' around here? - I come a-singin' to you. Oh, what a beautiful morning Oh, what a beautiful day I got a beautiful feeling Everything's goin' my way If I wasn't an old woman, and if you wasn't so young and smart-alecky, why, I'd marry you and get you to sit around at night and sing to me. No, you wouldn't neither, 'cause I wouldn't marry you nor none of your kinfolk. - If I could help it. - Oh, none of my kinfolks, huh? And you can tell 'em that too. All of 'em. Including that niece of your'n, Miss Laurey Williams. Who you takin' to the box social tonight? I ain't thought much about it yet. - Bet you come over to ask Laurey. - What if I did? You askin' me too? I'll wear my fascinator. - Yeah, you too. - Yeah, yeah. Oh, what a beautiful morning Oh, what a beautiful day I thought you were somebody. I got a beautiful feeling Everything's goin' my way Is this all that's come a-callin' at already 8:00 this Saturday morning? You knowed it was me before you opened the door. - No such of a thing. - Well, you did too. You heared my voice. You knowed it was me. I neared someone singing like a bullfrog in a pond. You knowed it was me, so you set in there, thinkin' up something mean to say. I'm a good mind not to ask you to the box social. - Oh, you two. - If you asked me, I wouldn't go with you. Besides, how'd you take me? You ain't bought a new buggy with red wheels onto it, have you? No, I ain't. A spankin' team with their bridles all a-jinglin'? No. Expect me to ride on behind ol' Blue I guess. You better ask that old Cummings girl you took such a shine to. If I was to ask you, Miss Laurey smarty, there'd be a way to take ya. Oh, there would? How'd we get there? When I take you out tonight with me Honey, here's the way it's gonna be You will set behind a team of snow-white horses In the slickest gig you ever see Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry When I take you out in the surrey When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top Watch that fringe and see how it flutters When I drive them high-steppin' strutters Nosy pokes'll peek through their shutters And their eyes'll pop The wheels are yeller the upholstery's brown The dashboard's genuine leather With isinglass curtains you can roll right down In case there's a change in the weather Two bright sidelights winkin' and blinkin'" Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin' You can keep your rig if you're thinkin' That I'd "keer" to swap For that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top Would you say the fringe was made of silk [Laughs] Wouldn't have no other kind but silk Has it really got a team of snow-white horses One's like snow The other's more like milk All the world will fly in a flurry When I take you out in the surrey When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top When we hit that road hell for leather Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather Birds and frogs'll sing all together And the toads will hop The wind'll whistle as we rattle along The cows'll moo in the clover The river will ripple out a whispered song And whisper it over and over [ Softly] Don't you wish you'd go on forever Don't you wish you'd go on forever Don't you wish you'd go on forever And it'd never stop In that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top You'd sure feel like a queen settin' up in that carriage. Only she talked to me so mean a while back, - I'm a good mind not to take her. - I ain't said I was goin'. - Well, I ain't asked ya. - Where'd you get such a rig at? I'll bet he's went and hired a rig over at Claremore, thinkin' I'd go with him. I did not hire it. I made the whole thing up out of my head. - What? Made it up? - Dashboard and all. [Laughing] Get off the place, you! Aunt Eller, make him get hisself out of here! Tellin' me lies. Now hold on. Makin' up a few "purties" ain't agin no law I know of. Besides, don't you wish there was such a rig though? You could go to the play party and do a hoedown till morning if you was a mind to. Then when you was all wore out, why, I'd just lift you onto the surrey, jump up alongside you, and we'd just point the horses home. I can just picture the whole thing. I can see the stars gettin' blurry When we ride back home in the surrey Ridin' slowly home in the surrey With the fringe on top I can feel the day gettin' older Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder Till it falls, kerplop The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill The moon is takin' a header And just as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still A lark'll wake up in the medder Hush you bird, my baby's a-sleepin' Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin' Whoa, you team and just keep a-creepin' At a slow clip-clop Don't you hurry with the surrey With the fringe On the Top - Only... Only there ain't no such rig. - Well, uh... Why'd you come around here with your stories and your lies, gettin' me all worked up? Why don't you grab her and kiss her when she acts that-a-way, Curly? She's just aching for you to, I bet. I won't even speak to him, let alone allow him to kiss me, the braggin', bowlegged, wished-he'd-had-a-sweetheart bum! She likes you quite a lot. She liked me any more, she'd sic the dogs onto me. - Hello, Jud. - Hello, yourself. Listen, who's the low filthy sneak Laurey's got her cap set for? - You. - Never mind that. Must be plenty of men a-tryin' to spark her. Plenty. What about him? Oh, she wouldn't take up with a fella like that, that bullet-colored, growly hired hand. Now, don't you go say nothin' agin Jud. Best hired hand I ever had. Just about runs the farm by hisself. Well, two women couldn't do it. You oughta know 'at. He's around all the time, ain't he? Takes his meals with you and sleeps down in the smokehouse. I changed my mind about cleaning the henhouse today. I got to quit early because I'm driving Laurey to the party tonight. - You're driving Laurey? - I asked her. Well, wouldn't that just make you bawl? Don't forget, Aunt Eller. You and me still got a date together. How we going, Curly, in that rig you made up? That there ain't no made-up rig, you hear? I done hired it over to Claremore. - Why don't you go with him? - I can't. I promised Jud. Why ever did you? 'Cause Curly's too fresh and too bigheaded, waitin' till the last minute to ask me. Aunt Eller, are you really going with Curly tonight? I sure am. You didn't want him. But you could go with me and Jud. You picked your feller, I picked mine. That's the way you want it, ain't it? You're sure a pair. Crazy young'uns. It's time I started for the station. Hey, Curly. Tell all the folks to stop by here on their way to the Skidmore party to freshen up. I will, Aunt Eller. You be sure and have your beauty spots fastened on proper so as you won't lose them off, you hear? That's a right smart turnout. Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin' That I'd keer to swap For that shiny little surrey With the fringe on the top [Wheels Rattling ] Aunt Eller! Lookin' for me? Should be a nice evenin' for the party. - Jud. - What? I... I don't think I can... You ain't figurin' goin' with someone else, are you? Well, I... Laurey! I'll come by for you along around about sundown. [Train Chugging] [Bell Ringing] [ Dog Barking ] [ Chattering ] What'd you do up at the fair, Will? Bust any bones? Aw, too smart for that. Just made sure I landed on my head. - Will Parker. - Hi, Aunt Eller. If you ain't got them fancy lanterns for the Skidmore party, - get back on that train. - [Laughs] - Here you are. - You do any good in the steer ropin', Will? Oh, I did pretty good. I won prize money. - Good boy. - I knowed you would. I got to get over to Ado Annie's. Her pa said I could have her if'n I was ever worth $50. And I got that $50. If Annie's pa keeps his promise, we'll be dancin' at your wedding. If'n he don't, I'll take her right from under his nose. Besides which, I won't give him the present I brung for him. Lookee here, fellas, what I got for Ado Annie's pa. Excuse us, Aunt Eller. You hold it up to your eye like this, see. Then when you get a good look, you turn it around at the top and the picture changes. - Well, I'll be "sidegated." - They call it the Little Wonder. Silly goats! The hussy! Ought to be ashamed of herself. You too. How do you turn the thing to see the other picture? - Right at the top, Aunt Eller. - Wait, I'm gettin' it. [ Gasps ] [Laughs] Oh, I'm a good mind to tell Annie on you. Bet you carried on plenty in Kansas City. Well, I sure did see a lot of things I never did see before. I got to Kansas City on a Friday By Saturday I learned a thing or two 'Cause up to then I didn't have an idy Of what the modren world was comin' to I counted 20 gas buggies goin' by theirselves Almost every time I took a walk And then I put my ear to a Bell telephone And a strange woman started in to talk - To you? - What next? - Yeah, what? - What next? Everything's up to date in Kansas City They've gone about as "fur" as they can go They went and built a skyscraper seven stories high 'Bout as high as a buildin' oughta grow Everything's like a dream in Kansas City It's better than a magic lantern show You can turn the radiator on whenever you want some heat With every kind of comfort every house is all complete You can walk to privies in the rain and never wet your feet They've gone about as fur as they can go Yes, sir They've gone about as fur as they can go Everything's up to date in Kansas City They've gone about as fur as they can go They got a big theater they call a bur-lee-Que - For 50 cents you can see a dandy show - Gals? One of the gals is fat and pink and pretty Aha! As round above as she was round below I could swear that she was padded from her shoulder to her heel And then she started dancin' and her dancin' made me feel That every single thing she had was absolutely real She went about as fur as she could go Yes, sir She went about as fur as she could go - What you doin', Will? - Well, this is called a two-step. That's all they're dancing nowadays. The waltz is through. Of course, they don't do it alone. Come on, Aunt Eller! - Oh, that's about as fur as I can go - Yes, sir And that's about as fur as she can go - What you doing now, Will? - Well, this here's called ragtime. I seen a couple actors doin' it. - Don't like it. - Oh, Will, I do! [ Horse Nickers] Still don't like it. Come on, Aunt Eller, do-Si-do! Hey, ha, pick it up! [ Chattering ] - Ha ha! - Hyah! Ho! [ Chattering ] Ha! Yahoo! Hey there, Will Parker! Come back here! - [ Bell Ringing] - [ Train Whistle Blowing ] - [ Girls] Oh! - [ Bell Ringing] [Train Whistle Blows] [Bell Clanging] Ado Annie, I could ride with you like this to the end of the world. Please, Mr. Hakim, don't start talkin' purty. Yoo-hoo! Laurey! Yoo-hoo! Whoa! Laurey! - Hello, Laurey. - What you doing with that peddler-man? - Will Parker gets back today. - Will Parker. Oh, foot. - I didn't count on today being Saturday. - I can see that. My, oh, my, Miss Laurey! "Jippity" crickets. Last time I come through here, you was teeny like a shrimp with freckles. Now look on you. Quit a-bitin' me! If you ain't had no breakfast, go eat yourself a green apple. Are you coming in or going out? Standing still while you're here. Go up to the house and wait. It would be no trouble at all to wait right here. So much water. Why don't we all take a swim together? In Persia, where I come from, bathing is a social event. - Well, this ain't Persia! - I can already see you two young ladies in those beautiful Persian bathing suits. What do they wear when they bathe socially in Persia? - Nothing. - Nothing. Ooh! The peddler-man's gonna drive me to the box social. I got up sort of a tasty lunch. But you're promised to Will Parker, ain't ya? Ain't what you might say, promised. I just told him maybe. - Don't you like Will no more? - Of course I do. There won't never be nobody like Will. Then what about this peddler-man? Oh, there won't never be nobody like him neither. Well, you got to make up your mind. Which one do you like the best? - Whatever one I'm with. - Well, you are a silly. Well, now, Laurey, you know that nobody paid me no mind up till this year on account I was scrawny and flat as a beanpole. But then I kinda rounded up a little, - and now the boys act different to me. - What's wrong with that? Nothing's wrong. I like it! I like it so much when a fella talks pretty to me, I get all shaky from horn to hoof. - Don't you? - Can't think what you're talking about. Don't you feel kinda sorry for a fella when he looks like he wants to kiss ya? Well, you can't just go around kissing every man that asks ya. Didn't anyone tell you that? Yeah, they told me. It ain't so much a question Of not knowin' what to do I knowed what's right and wrong since I been 10 I heared a lot of stories And I reckon they are true About how girls are put upon by men I know I mustn't fall into the pit But when I'm with a feller I fergit I'm just a girl who cain't say no I'm in a terrible fix I always say come on, let's go Just when I oughta say nix When a person tries to kiss a girl I know she oughta give his face a smack But as soon as someone kisses me I somehow sorta wanna kiss him back I'm just a fool when lights are low I cain't be prissy and quaint I ain't the type that can faint How can I be what I ain't I cain't Say no What you gonna do when a fella gets flirty? And starts to talk purty? What you gonna do? Supposin' that he says that your lips are like cherries? Or roses or berries? What you gonna do? Supposin' that he says that you're sweeter 'an cream? And he's got to have cream or die? What you gonna do when he talks that way? Spit in his eye? I'm just a girl who cain't say no Kissing's my favorite food With or without the mistletoe I'm in a holiday mood Other girls are coy and hard to catch But other girls ain't havin' any fun Every time I lose a wrestlin' match I have a funny feelin' that I won Though I can feel the undertow I never make a complaint Till it's too late for restraint Then when I want to I cain't I cain't Say No It's like I told you, Laurey, I get sorry for 'em. And now that old Will has to come home. First thing you know, he'll start talking pretty to me and changing my mind back. - But Will wants to marry you. - So does Ali Hakim. - Did he ask you about marryin'? - Not directly. But how I knowed is, he said this morning that he wanted for me to ride with him to the end of the world. Well, if we drove only as far as "Catoosy," he couldn't bring me home till morning and that means a wedding, don't it? Not to a peddler, it don't. [ Bells Clanging ] I've been waiting for you to show your face again, old peddler-man. Remember what you told me? You said that eggbeater you sold me would beat up eggs, wring out dishrags, turn the ice cream freezer and I don't know what all. Now, Aunt Eller, just listen. Don't you Aunt Eller me, you little wart. I'm mad. All right. All right! If the eggbeater don't work, I give you something just as good. - A present. - I wouldn't have it. - What is it? - Real silk. Made in Persia. What would I do with an old Persian garter? It looks pretty. Now lemme have the other one. Which one? Oh, you mean you want to buy this one to match that one? What do you mean do I wanna buy it? I can let you have it for 50 cents. Do you want me to get that eggbeater and ram it down your windpipe? - Gimme that. - Howdy, Aunt Eller. - Howdy, yourself. - Now that all the ladies are here, let me show you some pretty "doodaddles." Lace around the bottom and there are bows running in and out. Well, I never wear 'em myself, but I sure do like to look at 'em. All right. How about these? Yeah, they's all right if you ain't goin' no place. Don't nobody want to buy something? How about you, Miss Laurey? You must be wanting something, a pretty young girl like you. Me? Of course I want something. I want a buckle made out of shiny silver to fasten onto my shoes. I want a dress with lace. I want perfume. I want to be purty. - I wanna smell like a honeysuckle vine. - Give her a cake of soap. I want things I can't tell you about. Not only things to look at and hold in your hand, but things to happen to you, things so nice that if they ever did happen to you, your heart would quit beating. I got a-just the thing. The elixir of Egypt. A secret formula, belong to pharaoh's daughter. - Smellin' salts. - But a special kind of smelling salts. Here, read what it says on the label. You take a deep breath, and you see everything clear. That's what pharaoh's daughter used to do when she had to decide what dress to wear, or which prince she ought to marry. She would take a whiff of this. - I'll take a bottle of that, Mr. Peddler. - Precious stuff. - How much? - Two bits. - Throwin' away your money. - Helps you decide what to do. Put your trappings away and come inside. Come on, Laurey. Maybe we can find him something to eat and drink. Ali, Laurey and me been having an argument. About what, baby? What you meant when you said that about drivin' with me to the end of the world. Well, I didn't really mean to the end of the world. Well, then how far did you wanna go? About as far as say, Claremore. - What's at Claremore? - The hotel. In front is a veranda, inside is the lobby, and upstairs, baby, might be paradise. I thought they's just bedrooms. For you and me, baby, paradise. You see, I knowed I was right. You do wanna marry me, don'tcha? Oh, Ado Annie... What did you say? I said you do wanna marry me, don'tcha? What'd you say? I didn't say nothing. [ Man ] Ya-hoo! Oh, foot, just when... That's Will Parker. Promise me you won't fight him! Why fight? I never saw the man before. I fight only my friends. [Whinnies] Ado Annie! How's my honey bunch? How's the sweetest little 120 pounds of sugar in the territory? Will, this is Ali Hakim. Hiya, Hak! Don't mind the way I talk. It's all right. I'm gonna marry her. - Marry her? On purpose? - No such other thing! Oh, it's a wonderful thing to be married. - I got a brother in Persia got six wife. - Six wives all at once? Why sure. That's the way they do it in them countries. Not always. I got another brother in Persia only got one wife. He's a bachelor. You know what I got for first prize at the fair? - Fifty dollars. - Well, that was good. - Fifty dollars. - You catch on? Your pa promised I could marry you if'n I could ever get $50 together all at one time. That's right. He did. Your pa's like all the rest of them farmers. Don't think us cowboys got much sense. Well, this'll show him. You know what I done with the $50? - I spent it all on presents for you. - Oh! But if you spent it, you ain't got no cash. What I got's worth more than cash. The fella that sold me the stuff told me. - But, Will... - Oh, stop saying "But, Will." When do I get a little kiss? Oh, Ado Annie, honey, you ain't been off my mind since I left, all the time at the fairgrounds even when I was chasing them steers. Why, I'd rope one under the hoofs, and I'd pull him up real sharp, and he'd land on his little old rump and then I'd think of you. Don't start talkin' purty. See'd a lot of pretty girls in Kansas City. I didn't give one a look. How could you see 'em if you didn't give 'em a look? Well, I mean, I didn't look lovin' at them, the way I look at you. Oh, Will, please don't look like that. I cain't bear it. I won't stop looking like this till you give me a little ol' kiss. Oh, what's a little old kiss? Nothin', less'n it comes from you. Oh, you... You do talk purty. No! I... I won't! Supposin' that I say that your lips are like cherries Or roses or berries What you gonna do Can't you feel my heart palpitatin' and bumpin' A-waitin' for somethin' Somethin' nice from you I got to get a kiss and it's got to be quick Or I'll jump in a creek and die What's a girl to do when you talk that way [Yipping ] Must be the folks stopping on their way to Skidmore's. Oh! Oh, you're all welcome! Glad you could all come. Everybody come in and have a good time. [ Cackling ] I've been right behind you the whole way. - I know. I heared you. - [ Cackles] Oh, what a beautiful morning Oh, what a beautiful day I got a beautiful feeling Everything's goin' my way Oh, what a beautiful day [ Cackles ] Girls, come on in the house and freshen up. And you boys better drive your wagons down to the trough and give your horses some water. Hey, Curly, don't you reckon you better take care of your horses too? Thanks, Aunt Eller. I reckon I better. Oh, can't I come too, Curly? I just love to watch the way you handle horses. It's about all I can handle, I guess. [ Cackles ] Another mile in that buggy with that Perkins boy, and I'd have lost my mind. I'll take Wilbur if you don't want him. Looks like Curly's took up with that Cummings girl. [ Gasps ] What do I care about that? Why should a woman who is healthy and strong Blubber like a baby if her man goes away? A-weepin' and a-wailin' how he's done her wrong That's one thing you'll never hear me say Never gonna think that the man I lose Is the only man among men I'll snap my fingers to show I don't care I'll buy me a brand-new dress to wear I'll scrub my neck And I'll brush my hair And start all over again Many a new face will please my eye Many a new love will find me Never have I once looked back to sigh Over the romance behind me Many a new day will dawn before I do Many a light lad may kiss and fly A kiss gone by is bygone Never have I asked an August sky Where has last July gone Never have I wandered through the rye Wondering where has some guy gone Many a new day will dawn before I do Many a new face will please my eye Many a new love will find me Never have I once looked back to sigh Over the romance behind me Many a new day will dawn before I do Never have I chased the honeybee Who carelessly cajoled me Somebody else just as sweet as he Cheered me and consoled me Never have I wept into my tea Over the deal someone doled me Many a new day will dawn Many a red sun will set Many a blue moon will shine Before I do Many a new face will please my eye Many a new love will find me Never have I once looked back to sigh Over the romance behind me Many a new day will dawn Many a red sun will set Many a blue moon will shine Before... [Woman Cackles] Many a blue moon will shine Before I Do Maurice, time we got out of here. Back to the open road. The open road Ali. Ali, I'm sure sorry to see you lookin' so happy, 'cause what I got to say will make you miserable. - I got to marry Will. - Oh, well, that sure is sad news for me. Well, he's a fine fellow. Don't hide your feelings, Ali! I can't bear it. I'd rather have you come right out and say your heart's busted in two. - Are you positive you got to marry Will? - Sure as shootin'! There's no chance for you to change your mind? No chance. All right then. My heart is busted in two. [Gunshot] - Hello, Pa. What you been shootin'? - Rabbits. That true what I hear about Will Parker getting $50? That's right, Pa. He wants to hold you to your promise. Too bad. Still in all, I can't go back on my word. Listen to me, Annie, I advise you to get that money before he loses it all. Put it in your stocking or inside your corset where he can't get at it. Or can he? But, Pa, he ain't exactly kept it. He spent it all on presents. See, what did I tell ya? Well, now he can't have you. - I said it had to be $50 cash! - Is that fair, Mr. Carnes? - Who the devil are you? - Oh, Pa, that's Ali Hakim. Well, shut your face, or I'll fill your behind so full of buckshot, you'll be walking around like a duck the rest of your life. Ali, if I don't have to marry Will, maybe your heart don't have to be busted in two like you said. - I did not say that. - Oh, yes, you did. No, I did not. Are you trying to make my daughter out to be a liar? No, I'm only trying to make clear to you what a liar I am, if she is telling the truth. - What else you been sayin' to my daughter? - Oh! An awful lot. - When? - Last night in the moonlight. - Where? - Alongside a haystack. - Oh, listen, Mr. Carnes. - I'm listenin'. What else did you say? - He called me his Persian kitten. - What'd you call her that fer? - I don't remember. - I do. He said I's like a Persian kitten, 'cause they is the cats with the soft, round tails. That's enough. In this part of the country, that better be a proposal of marriage. - That's what I thought. - That what you think? - Look, Mr. Carnes... - I'm lookin'. I'm lookin'. I'm no good. I'm a peddler! A peddler travels up and down, all around. You'd hardly ever see your daughter no more. That'd be all right. You just take care of her, son. - Just take care of my little rosebud. - Oh, Pa, 'at's purty. Uh, you sure for certain you can bear to let me go? - Are you sure, Mr. Carnes? - You just try to change my mind. Aw, Ali, ain't it wonderful, Pa making up our minds for us? And he won't change neither. Once he gives his word that you can have me, you've got me! I know I got you. Mrs. Ali Hakim, the peddler's bride! [Women Giggling ] Oh, wait till I tell those girls! Laurey! Laurey! The peddler-man and me's gonna get married! [Woman Cackling ] Congratulations. I hope we'll be very happy. Oh, hi, Laurey. What you doin'? Gonna pick peaches. What you doin'? [Giggles] I peeked in your basket up at the house. I see you got gooseberry tarts too. I wonder if they's as light as mine. Mine would like to float away if you blew on them. I just did blow on one of mine, and it broke into a million pieces. Ain't she funny? [Laughs] - Oh! - Hey, now, girls! Stop it, Laurey! [ Indistinct Arguing ] Gertie! Gertie! Go on up the house and cool off! Get on! Mind! Don't forget tonight at the auction, Curly, mine's the biggest hamper! [ Cackles ] So that's that old Cummings gal I heared so much talk of. - You seen her before, ain't ya? - But not since she got so old. Never did see anybody get so peaked-lookin' in such a short time. Yeah. Says she's 18. Ha! Bet she's 19. Are you really gonna drive to the box social with that Jud fella? - I reckon so. Why? - Oh, nothing. It's just that everybody seems to expect me to take you. Then maybe it's just as well you ain't! We don't want people talkin' about us, do we? Do you think people really do talk about us? You know how they are, like a swarm of mud wasps, always got to be buzzing about something. What are they saying, that you're stuck on me? Uh-uh. Most of the talk is that you're stuck on me. Can't imagine how these ugly rumors start. Me, neither. Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours Why do the neighbors gossip all day behind their doors I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue Here is the gist a practical list Of don 'ts For you Don't throw Bouquets at me Don't please My folks too much Don't laugh At my jokes too much People will say we're in love Who laughs at your jokes? Don't sigh And gaze at me Your sighs Are so like mine Your eyes Mustn't glow like mine People will say we're in love Don't start Collecting things Like what? Give me my rose and my glove Sweetheart They're suspecting things People will say We're in love Some people claim that you are to blame As much as I Why do you take the trouble to bake My favorite pie Grantin' your wish I carved our initials On that tree Just keep a slice of all the advice You give so free Don't praise My charm too much Don't look So vain with me Don't stand In the rain with me People will say we're in love Don't take My arm too much Don't keep Your hand in mine Your hand Feels so grand in mine People will say we're in love Don't dance All night With me Till the stars fade from above They'll see It's all right with me People will say We're in Love Don't you reckon you could tell that Jud fella you'd rather go with me tonight? Curly... No, I couldn't. No, you couldn't. Think I'll go down to the smokehouse where Jud's at. See what's so elegant about him, makes all the girls want to go to parties with him. - Curly! - What? Nothin'. [ Quacking ] [ Knock At Door] All right, open it, can't you? Well, what do you want? I... I done got through with my business up there at the house. I just thought I'd pay a call. - You got a gun, I see. - That's right. It's a Colt .45. Say, now. That there pink picture... That's a naked woman, ain't it? Plumb stark naked as a jaybird. That ain't nothing to what I could show you. That's a good-lookin' rope. Feels good too. [Grunts] That's a good, strong hook you got there, Jud. You know, you could hang yourself on that. - I could what? - You could hang yourself. Yes, sirree. Easy as fallin' off a log. Why, in five minutes or less, with good luck, - you could be dead as a doornail. - What do you mean by that? And then folks would come to your funeral. - And they'd sing sad songs. - [ Scoffs] Why, they would. You never know how many people like you till you're dead. You'd be laid out in a parlor. All decked out in your best suit. Your hair all combed down slick. You'd have a high starched collar. Lots of pretty flowers all around. - There'd be flowers, you think? - Oh, and palms too, all around your coffin. People standing around, and men would bare their heads. Women would sniffle softly. Some probably even faint, ones that took a shine to you whilst you was alive. Now, what women ever took a shine to me? Why, lots of women. Only they never come right out and tell you how they feel unless you die first. I guess maybe that's right. They'd sure sing loud, though, when the singin' would start. Sing like their hearts would break. Poor Jud is dead Poor Jud Fry is dead All gather round his coffin now and cry He had a heart of gold And he wasn't very old Oh, why did such a fella have to die Poor Jud is dead Poor Jud Fry is dead He's lookin', oh, so peaceful and serene And serene He's all laid out to rest With his hands across'd his chest His fingernails have never been so clean And then the preacher'd get up, and he'd say... Folks, we are gathered here to moan and groan over our brother Jud Fry Who hung hisself up by a rope in a smokehouse And then there'd be weepin' and wailin' from some of those women. And then he'd say... Jud was the most misunderstood man in this territory People used to think he was a mean, ugly fella And call him a dirty skunk and ornery pig stealer But the folks that really knowed him Knowed that beneath them two dirty shirts he always wore There beat a heart as big as all outdoors As big as all outdoors Jud Fry loved his fellow man He loved his fellow man He loved the birds of the forests and the
