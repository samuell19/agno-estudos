Hey, here's a match. Give me a match, honey. 'What's your last request?' Give me a match. Hey, you! Paul! Look here! Boy! My friend Oscar here has given me an idea. There are six of us here. Five of us can do all the work. What do you say, each day we take turns going into the ballgame? 'Our uniforms will let us in free.' - Good, Paul. - Works for me. Wait! He go first. But suppose Foreman find out? Ha-ha. Go on in. Don't worry. Never worry about anything till it happens. And I'll take care of it then. Good, Paul. Where's Oscar? So, the Swede's gone to the ballgame, huh? Well, when he comes out, tell him he's fired. I'll send another man up tomorrow. Okay, but, uh, why another man? What do you mean? I can handle this crew, so five of us can do all the work. 'Just because Oscar's fired, we don't need to take his name' 'off the payroll, do we?' They needn't know at headquarters. Hey, tie a can to that highbrow music. Play somethin' snappy on the phonograph. You know, my pal Paul's a pretty smart guy. Talks all them foreign lingos to the crew. Hey, Babe, you don't know nothin'. Why, him and me's got the sweetest little business in the world, huh? Ha-ha-ha. You know, that money you put for me in the bank every week? Who do you suppose earns it, huh? Ha. You'd never have guessed in a 100 years. Nobody, ha. Nobody earns it, that's who. Why, we got eight men on the payroll that don't even exist. Eight good old ghosts all dressed in white. White-winged ghosts, working for Paul and me. And that's only a beginning. Now, who do you suppose to thanks to them, huh? My old friend, Paul. He thinks a lotta things. Hey, whe-where's your drink, old pal, huh? It's late, I've gotta be going. I didn't know it was gettin' late. If old Paul says it's late, it's late. And if it's late, I'm gonna bail. Eight good old ghosts, all dressed in white. Hey! Babe? That drunken bum. Sweetheart. By the way, how much is there in that bank account now? Four hundred and sixty dollars. Oh, Paul, be careful. If he thought there was anything between us, he'd kill me. - He'd kill the both of us. - Don't worry. Never worry about anything till it happens. I'll take care of it then. 'Babe?' 'What're you doin'?' Thirty, forty, fifty, sixty. 460. Did you get it alright, sweetheart? - Here. - Four hundred-sixty. Oh, there's nothing to be afraid of. We'd be a 1000 miles from here before he even suspects we've gone. Now, hurry home and pack, and don't worry. Oh, Paul, you really do love me, don't you? Darling, I've been saving this for you. It's my own dear mother's wedding ring. I want you to wear it until.. We must hurry. Train leaves in an hour. I'll meet you at the information desk in Dearborn station. Then we'll be on our way to California. - Please hurry! - Uh-huh. Union Station. I've got 14 minutes to catch the New York Limited. So, my nephew has returned to Holmtide in response to our appeal for his help and advice. I want you to know, we're all very grateful and happy that you found time to leave your vast holdings in Chicago to help us with our little problems here. - Yes, indeed. - We certainly are. Gentlemen, and friends 'because you've all been friends of my family for years' I see but one solution to your problem. Briefly, you must buy the Scania match factory, and merge it with yours here. 'Now, that'll be easy, because that village' 'is only five miles away.' Then, you must modernize the new factory. Cut down overhead and bring your manufacturing up to date. It's the only way you'll save your investment and your townspeople will be assured of continued employment. Sorry, the bank cannot advance another penny. 'I must have more security, and not one of you' 'has anything to offer.' Now, I hate it as much as you do, but I'm afraid we'll have to close the match factory. Mr. Larsen, just a moment. I've given this thing some thought and I'm willing to do this. I'll give you my personal note for 10,000 krona 'payable six months from today.' 'My vast holdings in Chicago' 'and your knowledge of my success in America' ought to constitute sufficient security for such a trivial sum. Moreover, I'm willing to handle the merger and take charge of the new plant at least until it's on its feet. - That's true, Mr. Larsen. - Mighty fine. - You can't refuse now. - Mighty fine. I suppose we could do that. Alright. Come over to my office, Mr. Kroll and we'll fix things up. Thank you, Paul. Thank you. - You'll never know what... - Paul, with you to help us.. 'Things are bound to work out.' 'Thank you, Paul.' Paul, you know your signature on that note won't be worth the ink it takes to write it. You haven't any vast holdings in Chicago or anywhere else. You asked me when I saw you in Chicago a couple of years ago to say nothing about your affairs here at home. I haven't, but, now I-I feel it's my duty to say something. Erik, old friend, what really have I done here today? I've saved the money of these old men. I've rescued their little factory and put it a position to compete with modern match manufacturing. And most important of all.. I've saved the jobs of most of the men in Holmtide. But you misrepresented. You're.. Why, this thing is fraudulent. But did I do it for myself? What difference does it make what means I used to accomplish all this? What if I did have a hard time getting a start in America? After you and I finished at the university in Stockholm I never found exactly what I wanted over there. But at last, I've found the opening I've been looking for. But you'll never be able to meet that note in six months. Of course, I will. In six months the merged factories will be doing so well that Larsen will be glad to renew it. And anyway, why worry? Never worry about anything, Erik, till it happens. Ha-ha. And I'll take care of it then. Why don't you quit that job in Larsen's bank and join me in working this thing out? I'm going a long way before I finish and you might as well be my companion on that journey. What do ya say? I'm giving you a draft on the Gothic Bank in Stockholm for 50,000 krona, and my personal note for one year at six percent, for the balance. But, uh, but the price was of the-the arrangement was to be for cash, Mr. Kroll. That's fine, Mr. Borglund and I don't mind saying that I've never had to do business on the other man's terms before but it's been a pleasure, Mr. Borglund, I assure you it's been a pleasure. Good day, sir. And he actually signed the contract. Well, Erik, there's the Borglund Timber. Lock it up, Erik. We're going to have other things to lock up in that safe. In fact, we're going to need a much larger safe before we're through. But how are we going to repay the Gothic Bank loan? Ha-ha, you asked me that when we got the first loan from Larsen, didn't you? Mm, that was 10,000 krona, this is 100,000. Why worry? Never worry about anything, Erik, till it happens. Then I'll take care of it. We might even let Larsen pay it for us. But then you'll be owing 100,000 krona. - No. - No? No! I'll owe a 155,000. You forget the 50,000 we paid, uh, Borglund, and the interest. But you can't keep on like this. Don't you see, the amount you owe will keep growing constantly until... Until I own or control every match factory in Sweden. When you started out to save this little match factory from ruin, I was willing to go along with you. - But now, I'm afraid I... - That's all I am trying to do. But to do that I must have every other match factory in Sweden. And after you get all the Swedish match factories, what then? I'll then be able to make matches cheaper than any other man on earth. I'll then be ready to begin. Begin? To begin what? Erik, can't you see the vision I see? What is the most valuable thing in the world? You think it's gold, don't you? Well, it isn't. Any day, any man in the world decides to the contrary gold will become a valueless metal. Gold is precious only because man wants it to be. But a match.. Do you know that a cheap, simple little match is the most valuable thing in the world? It's the one indispensable commodity. The one thing every person on earth uses regardless of race, color, or creed climate and circumstance. It's the one commodity the rich must have that even the poorest can afford. Why, the richest man on earth or the lowest pauper will give you a match. But I'm not going to give them away, Erik. I'm going to sell them to all the world and with them I am going to buy the world. Uh, during the last year we've induced almost every line of business to use matches for goodwill advertising. Why, even the gum people are fallin' in line. That's good, but it isn't enough that everybody uses matches, they've got to use them. What we've got to do now is to keep one person from using one match to light more than one thing. I don't quite understand, Mr. Kroll. But permit me to remind you that quality suffers every time you try and do a thing like that. Oh, I'm not talking about an inferior article that'll only stay lighted for a moment. It isn't a problem for our chemists or manufacturers. We've got to make the people themselves voluntarily quit using one match for more than one light. But, Mr. Kroll, that can't be done. People will do as they please. I'll tell you how it can be done. We've played on vanity, fear of burns the love of cautious parents for their careless children. But we've overlooked one important fact in humanity and that...is superstition. I want you to create a worldwide propaganda in every language, until mankind believes that it is bad luck for more than one person to light a cigarette from the same match. Mr. Kroll, that would counteract our courtesy and chivalry campaigns. Alright, let's make it three cigarettes. It's bad luck to light a third cigarette from the same match. Tie up your new campaign with the war. Spread stories that it was a superstition in the '20s that when three men lit their cigarettes from the same match one of the three never came back. Get writers to use it. Have playwrights build scenes around this theme. It may take a year and a fortune to put it all but I want it done. It will mean that one-third more matches will be used. Our sales ought to go up around 33 and a third percent and that will swell our profits 42 percent. Alright, get up and get busy. Phone the hangar to get out my plane. I'm leaving for Warsaw at four. Paul? Darling! May I ask what you mean by sending me such a telegram? Means I've stood for all the lies I'm going to. If you think you can say, "I love you, Sonia," one day and an hour later, send me a 1000 miles away on one of your errands, you've lost your mind. I'm through with all your schemes and plans. I am sorry, my dear. The schemes are dreams in which everything is built around you. There you go again. Go on, talk some more. Go on, my dear liar. I'm listening. Tell me how much you've missed me. You're cruel, Sonia. If words could describe the pain I feel when you're away from me. My dear, I'm so lonely and wretched without you. - Paul? - A thousand times.. I've almost decided to throw everything overboard to forget Stockholm, New York, Paris banks, factories, railways.. That I might come to you. I often feel that I can go on no longer, alone. I understand, Paul. It's only the vision of that paradise deferred when we can be together, that inspires me to carry on. How much longer must we wait? It won't be long. I can't go on much longer without you. Neither can I. By the way, Sonia, were you able to inspire Wadinski with confidence in you? So soft and pink and warm. So cruel. To hold all my future. - It might be even my life. - What do you mean? My dear, do you think I could've asked you to come here and do what you've done unless my very life depended upon it? Paul! Is it Wadinski who could do you harm? Then you've nothing to worry about. I can twist him around my little finger. Besides, he has enough troubles of his own to keep him occupied. What trouble, dear? I'm not sure, but it's something about the government's budget not balancing. He told me in confidence, the whole ministry's frightfully worried and alarmed. I don't suppose you learned the amount the government needs, my dear? Wadinski said something about a deficit of five and a half million dollars. Paul, where are you going? Something of the utmost importance. - When are you coming back? - As quickly as I can. I don't know whether to believe you. My dear, how can you doubt me? But, Kroll, you must be mad! I can hardly conceive your entertaining for one moment the idea that Poland should grant to you, a foreigner the Mexican section of this country. I'm astonished. 'You evidently know very little' 'about Poland's economic condition.' Notwithstanding which, my dear Wadinski the ministry needs five and a half million dollars to balance its budget, and they've got to face 'your parliament tomorrow night.' 'For the government to confess that it cannot' 'balance the budget would, I'm afraid' make a very dangerous situation for somebody considering the temper of the people at present. Why, even you, the leading banker of the country and financial advisor to the government might unhappily be the target for a firing squad. You've been grossly misinformed. - The budget balances. - I hope so. For your sake, Wadinski. However, should you succeed in persuading your friends in the cabinet to accept from me the money which they happen to require I might say that you'll find half a million in bonds under Sonia Lombard's pillow tonight. Do you realize, Kroll, that that's blackmail? Of course. Uh, what do you know about Sonia Lombard? It's a practice of mine to know a little something about everything, and about every prominent man and woman in Europe. I have always disliked matches. Very well, Kroll. I can assure you that the ministry will grant you the monopoly you desire. From this time on there will be no matches allowed in Poland but yours. 'Mr. Kroll is expected back at any moment. Have him wait.' Well, there's Poland, Erik. Lock it up in the safe with Finland, Austria, Denmark Brazil, Canada, and Romania and all our other trophies. I told you when we locked up the Borglund Timber, long ago that we'd need a larger safe than that. Yes? - It's Ilse Wagner in Berlin. - Ah! And now we'll find out what really is happening behind the scenes in Germany. Hello? - Hello, is that you, Paul? - Yes. Wait. I just got the information five minutes ago. Yes, go on. I'll be there early in the morning. Goodbye. Well, this is big news. Tomorrow morning, the Rothschilds and the international bank will refuse to come to Germany's aid. That means the end for Germany. Eleven o'clock. We still have four hours in the bourse in Paris and Brussels. Five hours in the London exchange. Does anybody else know this? Then we can unload slowly and prevent the market from breaking completely. I'll get... No, wait! I'm not going to sell. When the news gets out, our German securities will be worth nothing. Why, it means Germany's complete collapse. I've seen little matchsticks hold up more than one collapsing nation. I know, but Germany isn't Poland or Turkey. - It will take... - 125,000,000 American dollars. I thought that out while you were talking. - But, Paul... - When I have Germany cornered.. Then I will have cornered Europe. I know, but when the Rothschilds refuse to step in, it's suicide. They could've demanded and received the railways streetcar systems, public utilities custom house receipts.. Anything they wanted! And I will do it for the simple right to sell matches, at 200 for one penny. I'll get those other things later. - Thank you. - Congratulations.. We are deeply grateful to you. 'Look like matches to me.' 'I suppose I must've overlooked them.' Only Kroll's matches allowed in this country. Good evening, sir. Remember the wine is to be but slightly chilled, 42 degrees. Everything is prepared, sir. Are you happy, my dear? Then I'm sorry to have to tell you that I must be in Paris early tomorrow morning. But I planned on having you all to myself tonight, Paul. - I might stay a little while. - Until midnight? I'm afraid I can't, Ilse. 'This way,madame.' Must you really be in Paris tomorrow? I might not have to after all. - I might telephone. - Please, do. - Shall we dance? - If you wish? - You don't mind, Hans? - 'Not at all.' Won't be long. Shall we dance? I'd love it. Did you ever do that for a woman before? Do what? Give up business, drop everything for a woman. No. That's why I'm happy. - Marvelous, isn't it? - Marvelous. Gorgeous. Oh, it was lovely! Waiter? Wine. You know, I've never known you in such a mood. You're perfectly tender. To tell the truth, Ilse, I hardly know myself. Please don't try to. If you don't mind, my dear I'll put in that telephone call to Paris. Perhaps I can arrange to stay. Of course not, darling. Who is the lady in white? At that table over there. That'sFrauleinMarta Molnar, the cinema star. - Do you know where she lives? - At the Adlon. Thank you very much. I've made all our plans for tomorrow. - After breakfast, Paul, we'll... - I'm sorry. You don't mean to say you're going back to Paris after all? Well, I'm going to be frightfully busy. These require your immediate attention, sir. - Is everything in readiness? - Yes, sir. Remember the wine has to be but slightly chilled. Please leave it to me, sir. About 42 degrees. - Oh, yes, and the flowers? - I'll attend to that also, sir. But these must be got out to Stockholm at once, sir. You think you've got what I wanted? I'm sure of it, sir. He does things as a king would. After all, why shouldn't he? Isn't he the Match King? It's only slightly chilled, sir. 'The, uh, man you have at the door knows what to do?' He's to escort your guest here or to the main dining room. FrauleinMarta Molnar, please. TheFrauleinMolnar suite does not answer, sir. Who's speaking, please? Oh, Herr Kroll. I had a message for you. Just a minute. Oh, theFrauleintold me to tell you she was on her way. Frauleinis on her way. Frauleinis on her way. Mr. Kroll. I was told to deliver this to you in person. - When did you receive this? - 6 o'clock, sir. So, why didn't you deliver it till now? Well, the lady told me not to deliver it until 10 o'clock. Adlon hotel, please. FrauleinMarta Molnar's room. The Fraulein checked out at 6 o'clock. Why did you tell me she was on her way here when I called at a quarter to nine? Well, I'm sorry, that was the message theFraulein told me to give you if you'd call. And after he almost wrecked the hotel Carl says he started on the studio. And when he told him I had gone they thought he would tear the place to pieces. He will find out somehow that we are here in Salzburg. How can he? Only Carl knows. Maybe somebody may recognize you here. In these? No Match King is going to spoil my vacation. Oh,FrauleinMolnar. What a delightful surprise to find you here. I'm Paul Kroll. Yes, I know. Out for a walk? Do you mind if I join you? No, not at all. Are you sure you don't mind a long walk? I'd love it. It's rather rough country. The rougher the better. What time is it? It's 20 minutes to three. Oh, fine, it's early. We'll have time to climb the Mt. Berg. - Uh.. - Will you like that? Like it? I was about to suggest it. A good beginning don't you think? That I like the same things you do. I wonder if you really do. Why don't you trust me? I'm going to. I adore walking in the rain, don't you? I wouldn't have missed this for anything in the world. And weren't we in rare luck to have got a storm up here. There wasn't a sign of a raindrop in the valley. It always rains on the mountain at 3 o'clock. Regular as clockwork. Never misses. It's going to be rather slippery going back this way. Are you sure you want to come? My dear,Fraulein,I... I wouldn't miss it for, for anything in the world. Oh, oh, it's cold. - Oh, it's so cold. - No! Oh.. Good. - Oh.. - Oh.. - Scrub harder. - Alright. Harder. - Mm. - Oh. You are up early today, Fraulein. Up early and out early. And I won't be...annoyed by the Match King today, Trudi. Has he gone? Oh, no, he's still here. Poor man. I'm afraid he'll be here for some time. Why will he be here for some time? I'm afraid he has a terrible cold this morning. And he was sneezing terribly when we came in last night. - You little devil! - Poor man. Oh! Have Frau Niecker to send out some broth to him. Never mind, I'll, I'll tell her myself. What's the matter? I think I'm going to be ill. Yes, I'm going to be ill! I'm not going to leave this room again. Well, don't stand staring at me like a silly lily! Do something, get me the books we brought, the phonograph.. Where's the phonograph? Oh! Oh. Trudi. I'm sorry, Trudi. It's just that I hate to have him spoil my vacation. Who spoiled your vacation? What has happened? Oh, your great Match King. He's not ill at all. No. He's downstairs eating sausages. Sausages! I'm not going to leave this room again. At least I can read these books. And I've got five of Trino's records. Who is it? I brought your broth,Fraulein. I'm so sorry you're ill. 'And so was the gentleman when I told him.' Ho! 'Would you please register?' "Love is Joy." How many times have we played it the last two days? You want me to change it? Trino! And he's here! Match King or no Match King. Nobody's going to keep me out of that garden tonight. I've been waiting. You did this to me? For you. No one ever did anything so sweet for me. I've never been so happy. since periwinkles made me sick. What are periwinkles? Stars or little flowers? No. It's a little shellfish.. ...that comes from the North Sea near my home. I adored them when I was a little girl. Barclay Bank loan. The lease... There goes the Barclay bank loan. Power company refuses right of way. 'That's all very important' 'but it doesn't compare to the Barclay bank loan.' Now, wait just a minute, gentlemen. We've located Mr. Kroll. - When's he coming back? - He's in Salzburg. I have a call in for him now. And I've sent a special messenger by plane with all the papers. We'll have them back with his signature. On your Salzburg call, Mr. Borg.. - Yes. - Mr. Kroll refuses to talk. And the special messenger says he refuses to see him or look at any documents. Operating calling. Mr. Kroll wants to speak to Mr. Borg. - Oh.. - Ah.. Hello. Hello! Yes. Get this it's vitally important. Find out what village on the North Sea has the best periwinkles. Peri-periwinkles? Yes, I said periwinkles. P-E-R-I-W-I-N-K-L-E-S. Have them packed in ice and get them here by special plane. I want them by noon tomorrow. But, Paul, about that Barclay bank loan.. What's that? No, I don't want to hear about business. You handle things and stop worrying till something happens. And I'll take care of it later. Goodbye. He hung up on me. - What does he mean? - Why did he do that? I'm not sure he realizes.. Thanks a lot for the periwinkles and everything. - You're a dear. - This isn't goodbye. I'll be back on Tuesday. We'll go to Mirabel together. Mirabel, Tuesday? I'll be waiting. Are you sure, you come back? Nothing on earth can keep me away. Goodbye. Till Tuesday then. Take a wire, Erik. FrauleinMarta Molnar, Salzburg in Salzburg. Business makes it imperative for me to remain in Stockholm. Impossible for me to meet you at Mirabel. Paul. - Why don't you give it up? - What? This, everything. True, you have more power than any man in the world. But, Paul, does it really bring you anything? There's nothing I really want now. Then give it up. Don't I wish I could. Oh, why can't you? Really, Erik, it's quite simple. I haven't accomplished what I started out to do. What you really started out to do was to save the little match factory in Holmtide. I suppose that's so long ago you've forgotten. No, that's what I'm still trying to do. - But, Paul, I wasn't joking. - Neither am I. We saved the Holmtide factory with the 10,000 kronor I borrowed from Larsen, didn't we? Have you ever stopped to think what has happened to that 10,000 kronor? Well, you paid it back to Larsen long ago. No, it's never really been paid back. And now it has grown to 10,000 times 10,000 kronor. Oh, it's alright as long as I keep going. - But if I ever stop.. - I see it now. My great heavens! You'll always be in debt to somebody. Why.. ...why you'll never be able to catch up with this thing you've started. You're, you're caught in an endless chain. No, you're only partly right, Erik. Someday I won't owe anybody anything. What do you mean? I mean it when I circle the world when I own it all, I will be in debt only to myself. And there are other things besides owning the world. Don't you suppose I know it? I've been able to save Germany. I've been able to save France. I've been able to save Europe and other continents. 'But I can't save myself.' Accommodations for two on the Blue Train for Nice. - You're really going? - For three weeks. And you won't tell me where. So you could drag me back like you did from Salzburg? But something may go wrong. Nothing possibly can. Why do you suppose I've been killing myself all these months? For the glory of Kroll Match company? No. So, I could get away from matches for three weeks. Three weeks in paradise. By the way Nyberg is outside. You ought to see him before you go. - Oh, what does he want? - I don't know. He insists on seeing you. Says it's vital. He's pretty excited. Probably wants to tell me that he has found a box of Japanese matches on a German freighter docked in Liverpool. Alright, show him in. Well, Nyberg? What is it? Something that'll revolutionize the match industry. A man who.. Nyberg, if you're lying, if you're even mistaken... I'm not lying and I'm not mistaken. - Where is he? - I can take you to him. Can we get one of them? I've attended to that too. I've won the old man's friendship. - I'm the only one he trusts. - Come on. Wait here. It's Nyberg, your friend. It's alright. This is the friend I told you about. My friend, here's the gentleman I told you about. He has no love for the rich and powerful. He's a friend of the downtrodden protector of the poor. He has money and he's...willing to help you. - Very well. I believe in you. - Good. You may believe me when I say I hastened here when my friend Nyberg told me I could help you. The everlasting match. What does it cost to make? Less than a tenth of a cent. Does anybody else know about this? Does anybody know your formula? Good. Tell nobody. Absolutely no human being. 'Above all we must guard against this' 'becoming known to the match trust.' We must first seek out a secret patent. Then we can wreck the Kroll Match Company. Let me have one of them. I've arranged to take out a patent in your name in Switzerland. Kroll has no agents there. I'll attend to everything for you. Leave this to me. Stay here, watch him. Personal telegram for you, Paul. Send a wire at once to theFrauleinMarta Molnar Adlon Hotel, Berlin. Regret exceedingly I cannot join you. Well, the telegram I have is fromFrauleinMolnar. Oh? Never mind sending that telegram, Erik. That's all! This is Paul Kroll. An old pensioner of my company, a simple chemist named Hobe has become demented. I'm afraid he'll do himself harm. He has delusions that I am his enemy. No, but I'd want him to have the best of care. A private ward. Let no one annoy him. I'll be glad to pay for it, but I don't want my name known. The address is number 17 Borguster. Top floor. And the name is Christian Hobe. I don't think he'll ever recover his mind. Well, gentlemen, we need waste no time. We'll vote to pass the dividend. And immediately pull down our company about our heads. Surely you don't mean to declare a dividend. At this time? It's suicide. - Kroll, I won't stand for this. - Nor will I. Very well then, you'll stand for the Amalgamated Bank of Sweden withdrawing their loan? What does declaring a dividend now got to do with that? Just this. If we declare not only a dividend but an extra dividend, they're bound to renew. But if we pass our dividend we advertise to the world that we need money. And gentlemen, it is my experience that bankers and pawnbrokers are reluctant to loan money when you actually need it. and frantic to accommodate you when you don't. The committee from the Amalgamated Bank of Sweden is here. And I shall give them confirmation of the two dividends. Show them in, Erik. Kroll. Gentlemen, I am glad to see you. Won't you sit down? My directors have just voted an extra dividend. 'I fancy that this will be pleasant news.' For at a time like this I imagine that the Amalgamated Bank of Sweden will be glad to know that its loans are in profitable corporations. I wish that all of our debtors could say the same, Mr. Kroll. Your earnings warrant an extra dividend? I know of no other way of paying dividends except through earnings. We are very happy indeed to learn of the splendid condition of your company. 'Because otherwise, we wouldn't think of straining' 'the financial position of Sweden's leading industry.' Now that we know that your situation and position cannot be jeopardized 'we feel that...' You mean, you're not going to renew our loan? 'Precisely.' 'It's the people's money, you know?' 'And we feel that it is to the interest of the people' to use it to, uh.. To assist the smaller concerns. Which have not been so well managed as Mr. Kroll... I understand your viewpoint perfectly. And I agree with it...absolutely.. ...in such times as these. And, now, about the loan. Would a repayment of the money in 30 days be satisfactory? It's due in five days. It's entirely satisfactory, Mr. Kroll Thank you. Good day, gentlemen. - Good day, sir. - Good day. Forty governments owe you money. You control more than one billion two hundred million dollars in your match interest alone. To say nothing of your vast holdings in other lines. You're turning out 30 billion boxes of matches a year. You own 250 factories in 43 countries in Europe North and South America and Asia. And still, the shape the world is in today I don't know of a place where you can borrow one penny on this statement of your financial standing. We've come a long way from Holmtide, haven't we? Oh, well, don't worry, Erik. Wait till it happens.. ...and I'll take care of it. Cognac? No thanks. You've led me to understand,senor that you can use some paper of great value. I have here some truly magnificent work. May I see it? You are quite alone here. We have here 50 Treasury Certificates of the Italian government in the denomination of one million dollars each. They are as good,senor, as the original. If possible,senor, they are better. You say this will be alright. But I can only tell how good they are by comparison with the genuine. How many can you use,senor? All of them. I'll pay you $5000 now as evidence of good faith. The balance to be delivered to you in Paris tomorrow. Or the paper returned and the incident considered closed. That is satisfactory,senor. You're going to America soon, senor? And why do you think I should be going to America? Why, only the Americans could possibly have money enough for those. Did you have any difficulty getting into Sweden? Difficulty? I, Scarlatti? I make my own passport. I stamp my own visas. Nobody even knows I am in Sweden. Come on. Will you cast off at the stern? Oh, yes. Help! Wait! No! Where have you been this last week? I have been busy. I've been going crazy here while you were away. What are we going to do about that Swedish loan? Erik, I told you not to worry. That I would look after it. You mean to say you know where you can get your hands on $14,000,000 in cash? Certainly. Paul. Why, you're a magician. You pull things out of the air. You always have. How in the world do you do it? Oh, I'll just take some of those Italian bonds to Wall Street. Italian bonds? What Italian bonds? You disposed of those long ago. Did I? Erik, haven't you learned by now that there are a lot of things about me you don't know? But I'll explain everything when I return to New York. Meanwhile there's nothing to worry about. Oh, by the way, I wish you'd sendFrauleinMolnar a cable. You know her Hollywood address. Tell here to meet me in New York next week. Tell her I must see her. Paul, you're a wizard. And the music? All is arranged, sir, as you ordered. "Love is Joy" is the name of the selection you sent. The Limited is on time, sir. I phoned. The lady's on her way from the station. Paul! Oh, it's good to see you again. It's been a million years. Not quite I guess, but it seems that long. - Marta. - Let me look at you. Oh, you look older, Paul. I'm sorry, but you work too hard and it's told on you. You need moments like that one in Salzburg. Or you won't be the handsome man I once fell in love with. Oh.. Just like old times. Not old times but all times from now on. Marta, at last, everything is as I've wanted it. I've arranged a loan that'll make it possible for me to leave business for as long as I want. And that means forever, dear. With you. I have planned everything. You will give up pictures, and we'll never be separated again. Marta, I want to marry you. I'm sorry, Paul. But I waited so long. It's been ages. - And I, uh.. - You've what? What are you trying to tell me, dear? Paul, I'm in love with someone else. Who is he? Trino. But...I brought you together. Yes, he waited for me all the time I've waited for you, Paul. 'Trino dropped everything.' His entire concert too, to come to me. Paul, dear, he's waiting for me. I'm going back to him tonight. Next month, when I finish my picture we're going back together to Salzburg. I hope you'll be very happy, dear. Oh! That's sweet of you. I know what this means to you. You can never know. I'm afraid you'd better go, dear. Goodbye, Paul. And good luck. Imagine Kroll's colossal nerve. Forty millions of forged documents.. ...Inspector, I've always thought that Kroll is nothing more or less than a common thief! But I tell you gentlemen I can't believe what this message says. Anyway, Mr. Kroll will be here at any moment. Well, I believe it, I told Kroll back in Holmtide he was nothing but a cheat and rouge. And I'll t.. Why, gentlemen, I didn't expect to find you here. We came here, Mr. Kroll, because something.. Something of a rather serious nature occurred this afternoon. 'When we arrived here a few moments ago' 'as a delegation from the Amalgamated Bank of Sweden' we were surprised to find these gentleman here. From London, Amsterdam, Berlin and Rome. I am not accustomed to transacting business at this time of the night. I instructed Erik by cable that I'd take care of the loan when it comes due tomorrow morning. And as for these other gentlemen I must confess... Oh, stop this pretense. Tell Kroll why we are here. 'Show him that cable Pinchot sent us' 'from New York this afternoon.' 'That's what brought us here tonight.' 'Except there must be some terrible mistake, Paul.' I tried to tell them not to worry that you would take care of everything. Stop this! Tell him what the Italian Consul General in New York 'told Pinchot.' Always the small town banker, eh, Larsen? Never the gentleman. If you'll excuse me, gentlemen I have to make a telephone call. I'll only be a moment, and then we'll clear up this mystery you're hinting at. 'We're a lot of cowards.' 'There wasn't one of us had the courage' 'to tell this crook his Italian bonds were forgeries.' 'And that Pinchot cabled to his Paris bank' 'to cancel the $40,000,000 credit' 'he made Kroll to take up our loan.' 'And I can promise you, Erik, that no matter' 'what comes out of this, you'll go to prison.' 'I think you've been as big a crook as Kroll.' The foreman found out you were inside. he told me when you came out, to tell you, you were fired. I did my best to save your job for you. And who do you suppose thought that stunt up, huh? My old friend Paul. - Get it alright, sweetheart. - Here. Four hundred and sixty? I'll give you my personal note for 10,000 kronor. Payable six months from today. My vast holdings in Chicago and your knowledge of my success in America.. My own mother's wedding ring. To me the dearest thing on Earth. I want you to wear it. The man who saved the fatherland, Herr Kroll is gonna sell all the matches in Germany from now on. I know, now you'll be alright. You'll spend the rest of your life under close guard so that nothing can harm you. I'm not ill! That fellow there just came in last week. He'll be here for 20 years. Somebody said he was mixed up in that Kroll forgery of the Italian bonds. - And here comes Kroll himself. - How long is he in for? Oh, he'll be with us from now on. They're going to send him to Devil's Island. If you will take my advice, gentleman we will not turn him over to the police until after the market opens in the morning. Then we can dispose of our shares and protect.. - What was that? - Sounded like a shot! - Oh, this is horrible. - Oh.. ...extremely shocking. - Let's go down quick. - Yes. Oh! 'Began in the gutter.' 'He rose until he ruled the world.' 'And he died in the gutter.'
