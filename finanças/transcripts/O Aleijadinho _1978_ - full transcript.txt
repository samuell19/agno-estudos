THE LITTLE CRIPPLE Antônio Francisco Lisboa was born in Ouro Prêto, then called Vila Rica, in 1738. The son of Manoel Francisco Lisboa, carpenter and architect, contractor and master of the royal construction works. According to the description of Joana, the artist's daughter-in-law, Antônio Francisco was a dark mulatto with a strong voice, fast speech, and a bad temper. Until his 40s, he enjoyed good health. He saw to it that he always had rich meals and was regularly seen taking part in popular dances and festivals. Founded during the gold rush, and having passed through the initial settlement period, Vila Rica was then in a phase of prosperity and consolidation, but didn't yet display the traits that would later become so well known. The Nossa Senhora da Conceiçao church by Antônio Dias, the important Rosário dos Pretos chapel in Alto da Cruz and the Igreja do Pilar were just being completed, and the whitewashed mud walls contrasted with the luxurious gold carving of the interiors. That mid-century period was poised on the eve of a new artistic flowering, a true renaissance. Despite the closure enforced by the capital, the ideas born of the Enlightenment and the echo of revolutions crossed over seas, mountains and valleys, and finding favorable climes, took root there within the city limits of Vila Rica. The Casa dos Governadores, seen here in its early state and as it is today, overlooked a bustling and lively square where poets and scholars coexisted, as well as priests, students, musicians, architects, painters, sculptors and masters of all trades. The Palace and the Casa da Câmara, today the Museum of the Inconfidência, that would soon face each other from across the square, would witness the birth of civic awareness and the growth of a desire for freedom that Tiradentes, independentist martyr, would embody in the end. The tragic political outcome, however, could not stop the outbreak of artistic renovation that preceded it by 40 years with the chapel of Rosário de Mariana. In a small fountain dating from 1757 and undertaken by his father, we see the first marks of the work of Antônio Francisco, who never lacked qualified teachers. The composition introduces an innovative conception: It opens out and projects itself forwards simultaneously, lending it a dynamic quality despite its static fundamental structure. The unexpected female bust that tops the fountain is also evidence of Antônio Francisco's singular personality. At the time, he was 19 years old. Another work attributed to this period, from 1760 to 1766 is the rosewood oratory in the sacristy of the church of Nossa Senhora do Pilar, in Ouro Prêto. During this same period, he also worked on the Matriz de Caeté with José Coelho de Noronha. Several isolated pieces can be attributed to him. One of the finest is this Saint Anne, where with great sculptural refinement, a serene sweetness is counterpoised with the tension of premonition. In 1766, his reputation was well established. So much so that the Third Order of St. Francis, a renowned brotherhood bringing together the intellectuals of the time, did not hesitate to entrust him with designing their chapel. The result of their confidence in him was his architectural masterpiece: The São Francisco de Assis church in Ouro Prêto. Splendidly complimented by the paintings of Manuel da Costa Ataíde, the church nevertheless remained unfinished missing the choir, the grates, the lateral altars and other elements that were added later and do not rise to the same level. In the pulpits, which Antônio Francisco carved entirely from soapstone, the integration of the dramatic expressionism of the figures into the elaborate ornamental style of the period, became a constant feature in his works, characterized by a typical ardor. Dating from the same period as the pulpit, between 1771 and 1772, is the portal of the Carmelite church at Sabará, immediately followed by that of the Carmo in Ouro Prêto. After the death of his father, the original designer of the portal, he adapted the architectural composition to his personal style. Returning to the Carmo of Sabará, he designs an imposing gable in the audacious Dom João V style. Yet in the later sketches for São Francisco in São João del Rei, the gable features the characteristic grace of the Dom José or Louis XV styles. It's possible that from São João del Rei Antônio Francisco could have continued onwards to Rio, to visit the famous Carmelite portal, brought from Lisbon in 1761. Perhaps it was owing to this influence that he fundamentally altered his design. Upon his return to São Francisco of Ouro Prêto, he broke down the doorposts, the door poles and had the already-completed windows removed in order to place above the Franciscan arms the medallion of Our Lady, topped by the royal crown. That's how the Franciscan chapel of Ouro Prêto acquired its definitive appearance. An unparalleled work in which energy, strength, elegance and delicacy come together, endowing this architectural creation with the pulse of life. Back at Vila Rica, he later completed the beautiful font in the sacristy of the Carmo church. Right after that, also in soapstone, he makes the famous font at the São Francisco church, most likely a donation, since there is no reference to any payment in the books of the brotherhood. A breathtaking masterpiece, for it was during its long execution that the disease surfaced and deformed him. He lost the use of his fingers and toes, with the exception of his thumbs and index fingers. His face was disfigured, which gave him, according to his daughter-in-law, a repulsive and sinister expression that even gave a fright to whomever unexpectedly came face to face with him. Hence his bitter, sometimes choleric mood. Already in 1777, records mention two men that he hired to carry him and an official document states: “So much of value is housed within a sick body that has to be carried around and whose fists must be attached to tools so he can work.” He soon came to be known as “O Aleijadinho”: “The Little Cripple.” The disease only seems to increase his devotion to work, for his work swells and expands. After having finished the São Miguel e Almas church, he returns to Carmo of Sabará where he makes the elegant choir, the grate, the wood pulpits and two statues. Afterwards, he starts working on the fascinating Igreja do Rosário in Santa Rita Durão. Finally, he concentrates once again on his masterpiece: the São Francisco of Ouro Prêto church. Then he makes the monumental altarpiece of the main chapel, a work of great precision and rigor, sonorous and vibrant, like a chant of glory. Twenty years after his first visit, he returns to São João del Rei only to find his designs incorrectly altered. He continues to work daily. Finally, he concentrates his efforts on the Santuário of Nossa Senhora de Bom Jesus de Matosinhos. In Congonhas do Campo, to undertake, already in his 60s, the arduous task of depicting in life size each step of the Passion of Christ. And as if that weren't enough, after a life entirely dedicated to art, he plots out architecturally the churchyard of the sanctuary. And isolated on the hilltop, he again faces the tough blocks of bluish rock, from which he gradually extracts, without altering their consistence, these biblical figures, engraving in their gestures, pedestals and faces, their prophetic sentences. Back in Ouro Prêto, he continues working on two lateral altars of Carmo. Afterwards, his body deeply scarred, bitter and lonely, he lies for almost two years on a platform of wooden planks on top of two logs where, in his slow death throes, he begged the Lord to rest His divine feet upon him. The Little Cripple was restored based on a complete interpositive, created by the Centro Técnico Audiovisual. The original negative was damaged by mold. The original sound negative produced a positive, used as the basis of the sound restoration. The original film sync was maintained. Digital 2K restoration was completed in São Paulo in May of 2005.
