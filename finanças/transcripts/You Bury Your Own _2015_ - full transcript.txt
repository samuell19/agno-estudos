It's done. Uh, Ms. Ryan? Yeah. Uh, Detective Goodman... I'm sorry, it's been a long night. It's about your brother. Yeah... yeah you said that on the message. Is he okay? What happened? Well... We found him yesterday morning. Well he... he had no identification so... Can I see him? Well, technically we have to wait for victim services... I don't need it. What's he doing here? Nice to be remembered, Willa. I see you're taking care of yourself. He identified your brother. He's just tagging along. That's it. I always figured it would be John first. I want to see my brother now. Sure, no problem. Just as soon as "soft shoulder" gets here... ...we'll take you right in. In the meantime, we only got a couple of questions. Then get it over with. Didn't think I'd see you again. What? Do you believe in ghosts? That's funny. How you doin'? Can't complain. You know. You back for good? Or what? Just got in a couple of days ago. Head back out after the funeral. That's fucking quick. It's just the way it works. You got some place to be? Eh, I'm hooked up over at the brother-in-law's. You know? Keep the girl happy. PO off my back. Garage? I wish. Can't let anybody with a record in there anymore. Remember that building across the street? He bought it. He's gonna turn it into condominiums. You're building condos? Nah, not me. I just clean the place out, throwing out the trash. Nice. So? What? What's it like? Or are you not supposed to talk about it? Oh, is that what you came down here for? The recruitment speech? See, you're a suspicious motherfucker, man. Relax. I know a lot of people like to like shoot off their mouths. But I'm not one of them. When I heard what happened to Aiden, I knew you'd be back. I figured this... Look man, I'm not coming back. Not like that. Really? Good for you. Take control of your life. End of an era, though. Four years. Do you think it's long enough? I don't know. Was it really that bad? Cecil ain't stupid, you know? Sooner or later he's gonna hear. And if he don't find you there's always the funeral. Look, Johnny boy, just lay low. Alright? And don't make a habit of the same old places. Yeah, I appreciate it. ♪ ♪ ♪ First shot comes from up front, straight down the draw.

Yeah, he had keys. I'd do the same for you. Nah, I wouldn't have asked. And that's supposed to be a good thing? It's not a good idea for me to be staying with you, Willa. You know that. I know you're being paranoid. And I know that's one of the symptoms you should expect. Along with insomnia, nightmares, maybe even panic attacks... Come on, Will. I just got off a plane, I haven't slept, I don't even know what day it is... Are you really going to psychoanalyze me? Ignore it if you want, John, but they're real problems. A hundred and twenty-five suicides this year... Are you fucking serious? Can we just talk about Aiden? Please? Fine. How bad was he? A mess. And what? This was... regular? He wouldn't talk to me about it. Did you give him the same evaluation? Like I said on the phone, Ms. Ryan... ...same thing yesterday as the day before. Nothing's turned up so far. But you're looking? It's an open investigation. Sure it is, but are you looking? Yes, Ms. Ryan. Yeah, you're upset. I can see that. John says you won't waste ten minutes on this. Yeah? And why does he think that? What else did he say? He may have been robbed. He asked if he was selling. He didn't write? I mean, not like that. Ah... I don't know. Well, what do you think? I doubt they're even going to look. Why do you always have to do that? Why would you even say that? You said it. Nobody's talking, Wil. I mean, with something like this, something public, it says he's guilty.

So look, I'm gonna ask you something... Alright? And I doubt you're going to like it. Cecil Henry? That again? That was four years ago. Nobody ever proved that John had anything to do with that. What the fuck does it matter now? If I knew I wouldn't be asking. Gillespie told you this, right? That it? John's not even into that shit anymore. Yeah? And you're sure about that?

What the fuck are you thinking about, Willa? You can't do nothing. I can't lose both of you... I'm the one being paranoid here? Do you know who is investigating... Stop it, Wil! You gotta put that out of your head, right now. Then what the fuck am I supposed to think about? What's happening to you, John? Nothing's happening to me. Right... Lie to me. It kills me to watch you both making the same mistakes. You're more alike... Like the old man, maybe... Don't do that! He always respected you. Bullshit. He said that to make you feel better. He emulated you. Wonderful. Is that what made it okay for you to just sit back and watch? Pretend all you want, Wil. Dress up in your fancy clothes, put on your fancy scarf. We grew up in the same house. Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. No, you're right. I should have done something. Just promise you'll tell me if you hear anything... Come on, Wil.

I'd have been here sooner, but you can't factor in military flights. And it took me a couple of hours to rule out your sister's place. Willa, oh yeah, she's moved up in the world.

He seemed, you know, genuinely excited that you were back. I don't see it. He'd have tried to hide it. You'd have found Aiden in a river somewhere tied to a rock, or buried in somebody's backyard. Yeah, but what if times have changed though, John? Well... I think Cecil's the first guy I ever met who got better with age, detective. Oh, okay... Yeah... Yeah, I get it. All right.

Come on, we're talking about your brother, right? You said it, people die. You think he deserved it? You feel guilty? A little bit? You know what I think? I think you're right to feel shitty about it. I mean, whatever he did is only half the reason he got killed, maybe less. Take a good look. You'll see it's just as much your fault as his. You're responsible. And it's why you feel guilty. Your brain may be saying "No, no it can't be!" But inside you fucking know it. You see?

Yeah, sure. What about that place you and Aiden went? Oh no, that's a club. I mean, it doesn't even open until like 11:30. Well, then you pick. Yeah, okay. I can't believe you kept these. You know, I wanted to find something to put them in. How old were you, with the hair? I don't know, fourteen. That high-top fade was the shit. But look at Aiden. He was always doing his own thing. I know... We never knew where he got that shit. What? Nothing, I was just thinking about us... you know, growing up. I probably spend more time at your house than mine. Your house was like a vacation. You remember the nights that we would stay up, just the three of us, just talking shit. A couple of high school kids and the... the hottest girl in school. And you really talked to us. You really connected. And everybody was afraid of John, so we was never scared of nobody. You fuck with us, you had to fuck with him. And wasn't nobody that hard. You remember that night that uh... You kissed me? Well, I tried to kiss you anyway. The fucking balls, right? It was cute. Exactly. I was scared after that. I mean walking home, it was less than two blocks, but I was sure you were gonna tell John. I figured that was the end of it. Just like that. I stayed up all night. Freddy... No, you don't have to say anything. I was young and you... ...you were you. I never told him. I know. But it didn't matter. I mean, I wasn't family. I was just...

See it doesn't matter what you believe. When you're pinned down, you make your deals with God. "Just get me out of this." "Get us out of this, and I swear..." But there's no rewind. And... knowing how it works... ...that don't help. When an ambush is properly executed, there's no reason to expect anything less than a 100% casualty rate. When the first guy went down, you knew. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
