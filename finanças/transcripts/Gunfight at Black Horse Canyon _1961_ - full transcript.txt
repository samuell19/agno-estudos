* GUNFIGHT AT BLACK HORSE CANYON * It is very difficult for me to express myself, about the adventures that are about to happen. Apprehension and curiosity were constant feelings. This land was my enemy since I was a child, although I never came here. I thought I knew these intimately lands that filled me with so much hatred... But as I passed by it, I felt a stranger overcome by beauty. The colors of the earth, the blue sky and red seemed to be beyond imagination. I was determined to describe it in the best possible way... This primitive land that so influenced my early life. Whoa, whoa!... Let me get it. It's all right. Let's go after him. For sure. Look that. A valley is a good place to catch a horse. There is only one way out of this valley. You can't see it from up here Not down there either, unless you know. They're wandering. Let's take. We will. Let's get him where we want to go first. You don't think he's smart. Look there. Now he can see us from afar. IT'S. But this time I think that we will get closer to him. Jim, we've been after him all day and we're not even close. Let's give up. I'm tired. You come back if you want, Bo. I came to get you. So I'm going to get it. It's all right. But he could have a rainbow over his head. It's like going after the pot of gold. "WANTED ONLY DEAD JAMES WHITCOMB HARDIE" "5000 DOLLARS OF REWARD WILL BE PAID FOR THE PROOF OF HIS DEATH" "TERRITORIAL PRISON" Got? Yes. The way he wanted it. Clear and bold. "WANTED ONLY DEAD" I'll make Mr. Hardie sweat until find the right place and time. It is good to ride after ten years. Passed by? Yes. Red Mark and Tom Purdy. I put more in the bag if you want to distribute more on the way. Now he will know what it is like, to be hunted like an animal. Without ever knowing where, when or who... Have you put the hay maker brand on that stallion, Jim? Hey, Jim! Where's your stallion? I'm waiting, to put horseshoes on it! How was it this time, Jim? Came closer? Look what came closest to me. What happened? He tried to hit me in the back. I think I have a poster in there that matches this face. It seems to be Tom Purdy. Is there one in there that matches this one? It looks like he had a reason. I think he had 5000 reasons I also don't think he will be the last to try. This is a problem, Jim. I cannot arrest a gunslinger, who will pass through the city. Only if he did something wrong. I don't think you need to tell me. Be careful. You don't have to. Let's see... salt... It seems wide!... One dollar and thirty cents, Miss Tina. I'll put it in your account. Something more? Tina... What can a girl do to show that she likes someone very much? If you're talking about Jim Hardie, grow up. I didn't say who! Do not need. Good... Buy a gift or something. Where did I put that line... Oh!... What kind of gift? Something he wants more than anything in the world... All he wants is that old, wild horse. It is! Thank you sir! You're welcome. Excuse. I didn't want to meddle. He's a wonderful child. Thanks. Jay Squire. Tina. Miss Tina? Is a pleasure. Can I help you? It would be very generous. They wanted me to write, the truth about this wild place. And I will write the truth. I'll call it: "A hopeless desert". What did you say before? "All hope has abandoned those who enter here" It's pretty cute, don't you think? My name is Chance. Nason Chance. I don't know about you, but I get bored when I travel. It makes you want to talk. Where you are from? New England. Excuse. I wouldn't be so on the edge, if I were you. You can lose your balance and fall, miss. A woman like you wouldn't have much of a chance out there. Perhaps it would be better, than here. I don't know that. If you hadn't lifted that beautiful curly hair, the desert sun would have cooked you. What a way you have to put things... I'm not a Yankee. Traveling alone? Can you go, please? Leave me! I do not want to hurt you! Chance! He wanted my skin, for the trophy room. I'd stick around, but I don't know if the law will understand my point of view. You explain. What happened. I hope I didn't ruin your trip. The sound of the train trembled, my ears, while I looked at the body on the floor. As soon as I was introduced, to the West that Wells Fargo wants to sell to the civilized, the world. And now? Let's get some sleep. To sleep? How can you think of sleeping after being shot? If so, no one would sleep around here. Then I will stay with you. I don't think this is going to be necessary, Bo. What will you do? Walking around waiting, shot in the back suddenly? But for that I don't need to walk much. They will come to me. Do you think this is smart? Well, maybe not. But do you have a better idea? No. You are toughheaded. I think so. I'm about to receive some equipment tomorrow, so I think I'll stay, in the city. Good night, Bo. Good night, Jim. I had a very pleasant evening... With a very nice girl... Shall we toast for that? Your name is Squire, isn't it? I think we met, a while ago. Exactly ten years. Mr. Hardie. Tina... I think your mom may be worried about you. It wouldn't be a bad idea if you went home now. Squire and I have a business to discuss, that shouldn't be in your interest. I think you better be clearer, Mr. Hardie. Tina, he's worried that someone can see you, with an ex-convict and... I'm wrong about your concern fatherly for Tina, Mr. Hardie? That's right. Mr. Squire has already told me about, his problem with Wells Fargo. If your debt to society has already been paid, I choose to accept that. I'm sure you do, Tina. Now go home. Excuse me sir. Of course. You can sit down, Mr. Hardie. I found this with the dead man today. That and the fact that you come back here seems, be more than a coincidence for me. A piece of paper without records, without witnesses... It's jurisprudence, Mr. Hardie. I can sue you for false detention. Do you think this will make it easier, shoot me in the back, huh? I don't think you give it a chance. Not... I just wanted to see you sweat. Every time a doorknob turns, or a boot hits dust behind you. I'm paid to sweat. This is not going to be new. It is a dangerous land, Mr. Hardie. High cliffs to fall... And those cold mountain lakes. Do you want to die with a frozen smile on your face? Say it. You got a little more than ten years for murder, Squire. I was talking about an accident, Mr. Hardie. Like the kind you can have up there with that black stallion. And if something happens... only three people will know it was no accident. You me... And Raig. My Lieutenant. It's still the same. Still loyal after ten years. And still unable to think, with a brain other than me. How will you want it, Hardie? And you're still obeying you, Squire. Wait! Why not? I give it to you for free. You can have 5000. Why not now? Because Mr. Hardie helped me learn 2 things in those 10 years. The classics... That provokes so much soft talk, with your friend Tina. And patience. I can even wait. For the right time and the right place. And when you come, Mr. Hardie... I'll kill you. She was there, standing when I passed. He said the man who shot him jumped off the train an hour earlier. It will be difficult for her to prove it. It's. Excuse. I wouldn't be so rash, Hal. I knew that guy. He was a mercenary. His name was Turan. It could have been her, Jim. Have you ever seen a woman shoot a mercenary? Murdoc? Yes. Jim Hardie of Wells Fargo. This is the Sheriff, Hal Humphard. Miss Murdoc is the girl I was talking about, Hal. She is writing for an Eastern newspaper. Tell the people about the West. As it really is. Wells Fargo, is financing the trip. It seems like a good deal. It must cheer up those women in the city, to encourage his men to come here. A woman's point of view can be dangerous. The truth must not be too much danger, miss. Not even a little. I just don't think that's what Web Fargo wants. For now I'm worried, with that shooting on the train, Miss. Murdoc. Well for my happiness, the monster who did this was not interested in coming here. If not, I might not have arrived. I'll be at the hotel if I have any more questions. I believe there is a hotel in that city... Yes ma'am. Across the street. However, since you are traveling alone, it would be better to stay with us on the farm. For me to protect you on behalf of Wells Fargo, understand? Mr. Hardie, after what happened on the train, I think I survive without anyone here watching over me. I prefer to form my own opinions. Will she sell land around here? It seems that she has already formed too many opinions. This is all a waste of time. Let's call the sheriff and have him arrested. Our duty is to keep the law until the end. Do not use it to favor us. There has to be an indictment before arresting a man. Isn't assassination attempt good enough? I made one that can stick. Jay Squire was released from prison with an old prejudice. It is under suspicion. In addition, there is no record of previous arrest. Wells Fargo lawyers have advised to exercise extreme caution. Illegal intent is absolutely certain. Good... Did you understand what I said? Yes. Any news? Yes. Bad news. I think you can stop worrying. I just went to the stable. It seems that Squire and Raig left in the morning carrying water. Maybe it's our luck. They're trying to get to Mexico through the desert. No. Swamper said, that he taught them how to get in the territory of wild horses. In the southern valley. This is close to your area, Jim. I didn't know that they were horses, that they were wanting. And it's not. They are wanting an accident to happen. With me. When you're done looking, my good man, can you open the gate? I think I better keep an eye on him. The region, through the eyes of a woman, is steep, hard and cruel. Struggling severely, regrettable efforts, of the pioneers who would invade. The people are no longer formed, by human beings. The West froze, burned and drowned them. They live almost like animals. It will tell me that you, jumped off the train too. Why would I do that? I didn't kill anyone in cold blood. It wasn't you who was standing in his direction, either. I have no intention of staying here discussing morality with you. Let go of my arm. You really are full of arguments. What are you doing here? I am writing, a book if you want to know. In all my life, I have only read one book. It was a fable. It was the story of a fox, who wanted some grapes. She said they were sour when she couldn't catch it. I think there are people who are like that, when they don't get something. I still don't think I understand your language. It doesn't matter what your lips say. That's what your eyes say... I was just trying to answer, which your eyes asked. Maybe I'm not seeing very well. Hi, Hardie. The last time I saw you, it was down south. We had a disagreement, I believe. Yes. I think I took too much tequila and you didn't like it. Still at Wells Fargo, my dear Jim? It is honest work. Still carrying weapons, for revolutionaries? No sir. Those mercenaries risk a lot for little money. I gave up on that to work, for myself. Mr. Hardie... If I can interrupt... Your... Your old companion there, is a murderer. Is he the man on the train? That guy came over me. I have a right to protect myself, don't you think? Is that true, Miss Murdoc? Did the guy pull the gun first? Well... I think so. I don't see what difference it makes. He still fired. It's a big difference. It is the difference between murder and self-defense. That man was a mercenary. I hope you tell the Sheriff that, Jim. It doesn't matter to some Sheriffs, who the mercenaries bring. It just can't be alive. I am not the Sheriff and I cannot speak on his behalf. But I can promise you, something. If you are wanted, for something, we will end up facing each other. In fact, I owe you one, Jim. You already took advantage of my condition. Is it the best you can do? Do you want to try it? It looks like you still beat me, Jim. I want to keep, things like that. I think that's fine with me. For the good times. The good times are not going to stop me from checking you out. You have responsibilities. I do not. That is the difference between you and me. And just for the record, Jim. I am not wanted. For anyone. So why did you jump off the train? I didn't think the law would believe my story, but I think you do. If the Sheriff wants to speak to me, I will be in town. See you. Bye, New England. I don't think, which is a good idea, you walk around alone, Miss. Murdoc. You're right. The law in the West seems to be quite incompetent. The law in the West is no different, than any other. "Laws are silenced in the middle of guns," Mr. Hardie. Sincerely. "Laws are not valid just because they are laws, but because they are enforced". A man named, Beacher said that. Are you going back to the city? Since it is not safe for a woman to go out alone; I think I will have to suffocate in that hotel. If it gets too smothered, we can still have it on the ranch. It is right on that road. You can't go wrong. Mr. Hardie... Let's get one thing straight. I know your hospitality, from the West, it's just obedience, to your employers. What makes you so bitter? I'm not bitter, Mr. Hardie. I am cynical. Don't you know the difference? Patience, Raig... Hardie stayed three months behind me all over California. I intend to make it so long and painful for him. There must be an easier way to get to Hardie. Be a philosopher, Raig. All the best comes to those who wait. Stopped! Jim... Do you want to end up dead? You need someone to follow you. Maybe they should. But I don't need to tell you that following a man is like following a bear. The two are curious, to know who is behind. You have to walk slowly, in silence. Merge with the scenario. I just hope you don't become part of the scene by taking a shot. How many of those pamphlets do you think are flying around? There's no way to know. What we know for sure is what we got with the guy, who tried to hit us. But he can be one out of 10, 20 or more... That's right. On the other hand, Squire may just be looking to scare you. Don't be so sure. How many did you see? Only one. Did you see any? I did not see anything. One no, it must be a lot of trouble. Keep him busy, I try to catch him from behind. Thanks. Stopped! All right, Bo! I found this with him. It was the Raid, wasn't it? You got in trouble, sir. He says who it was, unless he doesn't know, who is alive or dead. It was Raig, yes. And? Who else did he give these posters to? I do not know. Purdy! It was Tom Purdy... Only that! It was Tom Purdy and me! Liar! Wait, Bo. Take him to town. Come on. May I know, what are you doing? Don't you know what a soap maker is? Not even. Wouldn't it be easier to buy a bar? I am running your farm. I want to save your money. Have you changed your mind, Miss Murdoc? Do not. You ride a horse too well for someone from the east. My family has been riding for years. Not!... I don't want you to misunderstand my intentions to come here. I heard that this farm is typical of the lifestyle here. I think that's more or less. Jeb, this is Miss Murdoc! This is Jed Gain. He runs things around here. It is a pleasure to meet you, Miss Murdoc. Ah, I wouldn't say that is, a five star hotel in Boston, but... But it is very comfortable! Hold it, Jim! Hold on! Hold on! Jim, are you okay? I'm fine, yes... What a terrible cut. I hit the wagon over there. It is better to take it, inside the house. Come and I do your dressing. You need a doctor. You don't care about anything. I will leave you well. MS. Murdoc, come here to clean up the dirt around you. Comes... I have to go to the barn, get cobwebs. What are you talking about? You mix it with wheat flour. Nothing better, to make the blood stop. But this is ridiculous. He has an infection, with these filthy things. It is not what the doctor said. I learned from him. And he has been doing this for 40 years. I'll be right back. The doctors learned from the Indians. They use cobwebs successfully. Longer than his family, he rides a horse. Really? How fascinating. I think I have to get used to the primitive environment. May I ask you a question? What did you accept this job for? A challenge, Mr. Hardie. How to get on a balloon. A challenge from your father? I think it is well known, that he is one, of the largest cattle owners, from Wells Fargo. Upon my mother's life. Unfortunately I don't understand. I understand more about this West, than you think. My mother was dragged here, away from civilized life, which she knew. They fought against this desert for so long, who went blind until my father found gold. It was an escape for him. But for my mother it was too late. She died giving birth. Do you think it could not happen there in the East, or elsewhere? It won't happen to me, no matter what my father thinks. I am not interested in romanticizing the West for it to be justified. I can only see in this place, how my mother must have suffered. I think that answers all your questions, Mr. Hardie. Not exactly. There's one more, if you don't mind. Can you tell if your mother loved your father or not? Because? Would that justify everything? It is not with another question that a question is answered. You are starting to look like my father. He has some primitive ideas, which I don't really understand. I think maybe he's right. You will find out here especially in this region. What really counts is what's inside of a man or a woman. If they love each other enough they can survive almost anything. Here it is. This will stop the bleeding quickly. It will be brand new. Good morning, Mr. Hardie. I hope you survive. It would be a good woman if someone put something on her head. Good... I don't think she's a domesticated calf. Take it easy, I'm not. So you better stop behaving like one. What a beautiful day! I feel like a young bull! Are you the sheriff here, sir? It's me. Is a pleasure. I'm Major Bob Shangler. Empire builder. I am the biggest cattle owner on this side of the Mississippi. I heard about your cattle and I'm ready to pay for whatever I like. My boys here work hard and play hard. These thousand dollars should cover any damage they have done to your city. Have a nice day, sir. I think it is better, I go to watch our literary. I don't want them to put another chapter in her book. For! For!... Helping girls in distress is your business, my dear Jim. I was on my way when it started to get heavy. I saw you were. I researched you, Chance. He is not wanted for anything. As for the train incident, others have already made mistakes. The Sheriff will consider it as self-defense. In view of the girl's testimony. Things are getting interesting, Chance. What were you planning to do? Save her from sin and corruption? I have better things to do. That is why we are here. So far all I've heard is music. And the cups that breaking with the screaming female. Aren't you ready, for $ 50,000? I think my ears are not very good. It doesn't have to be that good. A few meters from you. In a belt around the waist. It's so fat you can't see it. It is bad for the heart. How do you know it's there? I have good ears. I heard the Major talking about. What is your plan? I'm going to have fun with him and take a weight off him. The best time will be tomorrow during the cattle show. I'm starting to wonder if it's safe to leave the door in this city. What made you get in there to start? I saw a snake pit and was attracted. Like some people, they are attracted to the smell of blood. The men in that bar didn't want to hurt you. They are hardworking farmers who just wanted, relax after hard work. They are no different from the men of the East. Perhaps they are more direct. Sorry, but I was right about what Wells Fargo he wants to shove down the throat of civilized people. You are totally mistaken. I will not give you the satisfaction to admit it, returning, Mr. Hardie. It will take more than a snake pit for me to give up. I will write about the West and all its sick glory. I have more important things to do than discuss with you. But I happen to believe it, in this place. In people and their dreams. They're here on the border, in the desert. One day they will create, a great civilization. They've fought the desert for so long that they don?t realize anymore, that they?ve been absorbed. Maybe there was a dream before. But there is more. No, it's still there, maybe you can't see it. Sometimes you have to dig a lot to get to the gold. Even if it means getting your hands a little dirty. Say what you want, Mr. Hardie. You will not change my opinion. But I will try. Good Morning. Yes, sir, major. I treated this type of cattle, only six months ago. When will this sample of cattle begin? Much to go, Major. Let the worst end. Nobody will touch the ones you want. Yes. Take one more. Better take him to the hotel room. He has a few hours to get well. The people, the horses, the carts flow in a muddy stream here. They've fought this desert for so long, who has no more sensitivity to... Stay in the coverage that we?ll be back to. Who is it? Room service, sir. What you want? An ice pack, for the Major, sir. It's a toast from the management. It stands still that no one gets hurt. What? Stop, Major. You naughty. Do you think you will get away with this? Let him take the feeling off by himself. Let's get going fast! Do you think you are smart, are you? I've dealt with people, worse than you, and I'm done with them. This was an old man with a hangover. I didn't need that! You like to talk a lot! Want to talk? Talk to them! Chance! Does he know you? Let's take her along. Stay there, Hellen! Sheriff! Sheriff! Sheriff! Sheriff, there was a shooting in the Major's room. Did you see who did it? Yes. I saw some, at the bar just before. They were getting the major drunk. Let's take a look. And one more thing, Sheriff. Do you know that journalist? They took her hostage. Are you sure about that? Of course! You talked to her at the bar yesterday. Chance... I'll try to see where they went. Get men together and go after me as soon as possible. Did someone follow? We are free. I said I couldn't shoot, Falc?o. We got what we wanted. You are leaving the agreement. I'm not liking. Every man for himself. Even wolves work together. The more the bigger. He's in charge. He works the fastest and closest. I told you this was my group. And I remember the last one. We lost a good deal because the group was yours. You're getting limp. I was always soft in relation to shooting a man for no reason. I do my own reasons! It seems that if I don?t pay attention, I will have someone, to cut my throat. You may need to cut, Chance. Wolves do not follow sheep. I think a bullet in the belly would be painful. Where's your imagination? We're looking for revenge. My revenge. I am the one who says what is painful, for Mr. Hardie or not. Okay, okay. We do it your way. You call if we wait, in the shade. I'm going to make Mr. Hardie sweat. We could have taken Hardie and you let him go. Let's go up to where the stallion is. The one Hardie would give his life for. We will take our share and go to Canada. You do your own business. It's her? I don't like witnesses. I take her with me. You take her with you dead. Perhaps you are right, Falc?o. Maybe I'm getting soft. If you are a wolf you have to act like one. I told you to pay attention, New England. Don't shoot! Outside, New England. Get on a horse. Put the nannies on the floor there. Fast! As you said, Falc?o. What I do is my business. I also said that your throat needed to be cut, Chance. No wonder they call me Falc?o. Make no mistake. There won't be another chance. Out there. Are you hurt. Nothing serious. It's just swollen. I want to thank you for saving my life. Don't thank me. Confuses my head like before. I like you better that way. Hardie's house is this way. Do you know where it is? Yes. Go where they help you. I will not go without you. What's up, New England? Is the revolt over? Please, Chance. Let me help. It's too late, New England. I do not want to leave you. There is no time, New England. It's now or never. Skirt! But what are you going to do? I will run away from this place and you would only get in the way. Give it to Hardie. Yes, they did. There's a candle in there still lit. It looks like the track leads there! Miss Murdoc! What is happening? What is the problem? Let's go into the house. Come on No, no, no, no, nothing!... You just sit there, everything will be fine. What happened to you? They wanted to kill me! Kill you? Who wants? I'm going up! I do not know... They stole someone. I heard them talking. Don't worry anymore. You'll be safe here! What is it? Money... What money? Chance gave me. Oh, please! They need help! Hmm!... Okay, but... I better do something about that cut on your forehead first. As in the old days, my dear Jim. Not exactly. I told you what would happen if you became a wanted man. You'd better use that weapon if you don't plan on coming back with us. It's as empty as my head. The girl is in danger, Jim. She was with me. I told her to leave with the money. Falc?o must have gone after her. Where did she go? I'll go with you. You're going back to the city with the Sheriff. This is not the time to argue. I know where she went and I only speak if I go with her. It's all right. I take responsibility. That's right. We take it back to the city. Do you think you can ride a horse? I don't want to leave you here and let the sheriff know about it. I'm fine. You were really nice, Jeb. I want to apologize for what I said when I came here before. I don't remember you saying anything too bad. I hope you dedicate an entire chapter in your book to me. Put that rifle back on the floor. New England, is that what he calls you? You are far from home. What you want? You shut up. I should have known, that you were together, by the way he looked at you in that bar. Very well... Where is it? You tell me where you are. That money will go back to the place right and there is nothing you can do. Tell me now, where is it. Stopped! Remember what I said, Falc?o. Don't make a mistake because you won't have another chance. Take care of him. Get him out of here. Are you okay, Miss Murdoc? Yes. Still setting me up. Is empty. Where is the money? He gave it to me, to deliver to you. What are you going to do with it? I'm going to have to take you to the Sheriff. Two dead men. I have nothing to do with this, Jim. That is the truth. This is for the law to decide. Sr. Hardie... I want you to let him go. I... I don't think I understood you very well, Miss Murdoc. I said, I want you to let him go. Go away. Get out. Wait a minute, New England. Go away. You said there is no time. It's now or never. He saved my life, Mr. Hardie. I want to thank. You are not thanking him for helping him escape. When he brought money back, he volunteered himself. It will make a lot of difference. He will still be arrested. Yes he will go. I've already been arrested. There in Texas. I should have learned something. But I didn't learn. Do you want to go back? You made me want to go back. We are from two different worlds, New England. Now we have to go back to where we belong. Perhaps my world would have been, much better if you had been in it before. Thanks. Hey, you little thief! What do you think, what are you doing? Good morning, Jeb. I was just going for a walk on the ranch. What do you think I command here? Mother Joana? I've been training him or two months and not wanting anyone walking on it! What kind of training? Special? Certainly special! Why every time, that I look out at you Are you in my corral on top of my horse? Nobody knows how to train a horse as well as you do. And so. Don't give me that easy talk. I know who you have eyes for. And Jim is not here! Jeb... Tell me... What are you training them for? It's a secret. I don't count. I promise. I don't tell you at all! You are the best horse trainer in the world. And I love you, with sugar and cream. Please... Please tell me... Well, fine. But you better not talk to Jim. It's a surprise. This is a special whistle. What is it for? Be still and I'll tell you. Do you know that stallion Jim wants to catch? Hmm!... Well. That whistle will bring him right to our door. Like? Have you ever heard of the Judas goat? What brings sheep to the slaughterhouse? You will see I got a Judas horse. Pay attention. Good old Snowball. Let's get that black stallion, shall we, boy? Let me try it please? Absolutely not! Not twice! It took two months to get him to come to me and I won't... Did you smell anything? Just burnt bread. Yes. I thought that was it. Burnt bread! Oh no! Damn oven! It burned everything! Hey! Come back here with my horse! Mary Jane! Hey, you thief! Come back here! That's it! Just like your mother! How nice. This is your chance. I have the whistle but you know how to do it. You take it over there, I do the rest. Go get him. And don't forget to come back when I whistle. It's no use! You can beat yourself as much as you want. I won't let you go! Forgive me, girl. Scared you? Do not. You are the man I saw at the store yesterday. To dominate two wild horses, you are an incredible one. My name is Mary Jane. What is your? Jay Squire. At your disposal. Are you at my disposal? You know, I'm in trouble. Yes, Mary Jane. I think so. "SHERIFF GLORIBEE OFFICE" That's it. Enough of that. They've already taken Chance and his gang. Leave it to old Jim. It's too late, New England. I do not want to leave you. We are from two different worlds and now we have to go back to our place. Ah!... As I imagined... Did you think you were going to sneak, in so I wouldn't catch you, huh? Mary Jane! Mary Jane! Ha-aa, well!... You have to be more rascal than Wells Fargo to stop by old Jeb here. So you have to be very tricky huh? Jim? Are you planning something special, Jeb? No. I just came here to set the barn on fire. Damn female seats! He took my horse and he's running around! Wait only when I meet her! And you want to know something? What are you talking about? What is the problem? Mary Jane! She's the problem! She ran away with Snowball six hours ago and so far has not returned! She's just a child. Time means nothing when she's on horseback. Yes? She is afraid to come back. So we will have to send a search after her. Now I got in trouble. Hey Jim! Come quick! I said I was going to have a problem! Look that! More cut than dog meat. That little bugger sent him back, because she is, afraid to come back. It doesn't look like something she would do. Look around. You don't see her, do you? That's horse hoof cutting. Horse's hoof? Oh no... I knew I shouldn't have told her. Told what? This horse here. About how I've been training him for Judas horse. How is it? To catch the black stallion. Well... The horse Judas is fine. But what about Mary Jane? Hey, Jim... She's still around. Tell Bo to go after me. Tell me to meet you in Vale do Sal. There must be something I can do. Yes. Go to the city and prepare a search if we need it. Mary Jane! Mary Jane! Hardie! Up here! Looking for something? Yes, I am. Where is she? It's not that easy. But we make it easy. Where is she? I have an agreement for you. You know, that I take you to her. What if I don't accept your agreement? She dies. You decide. Decide soon. Do we go alone or do you find her under the valley? It's all right. It's all right. We are agreed. Roll it up right! Have you found her, Jim? No, no... I went up thinking I could, to find something... I look around here. You go to the plains and look there. Plains? Jeb said that Mary Jane went after the black stallion. You know as well as I do that he doesn't go there. There is no water there. You talk too much and don't listen. Don't argue with me. Will soon! And one more thing. Do you remember where we were this morning? We will stay there. Perhaps. Maybe I remember a lot. So Hardie... Drop the belt... He has a whole plan in place. I'm not that specific anymore. He killed me, with a bullet. We will... Patience, Mary Jane. Even your stallion knows that he has to guard his strength. You and I know the advantages of waiting. Mary Jane... Wait! Are you worried, Mr. Hardie? Resentments are not resolved, with Squire innocent people. Resentments? Why not call it a prize? For ten years of waiting? If there's anything to solve, it's between you and me. Not with her. Let her go. On the contrary. She brought us together. On the right time... On the right place. With a gun, behind my back? I could have done that back in the city. I thought you were, a man who wanted accidents. Ah, but you're going to have an accident, Mr. Hardie. It's an impressive turn, don't you think? Trampled to death by the horse, which you so wanted. Take the strings. It will be slow, Hardie. A little at a time. Thanks. I arrived halfway, the way before I realized what you meant. It was close by. Too close. Watch them. Where are you going? I'll take care of our little friend over there. What do you think, what were you doing? Going out with that horse like a trainer. I could have killed you. I'll tell you something. I'll take you back to the city. I just want to see, what your mom will say. What do you have to say? Nothing. I didn't want that horse at all. Why did you go after him? I went to get it for you! So why don't you like me? What makes you think not? You never even noticed me. So I had to give you something special. Oh!... Do you think you can go out and buy friends, do you? Let me ask you a question. We are friends, aren't we? You... Every time I go on a trip, don't I always bring you a gift? Hmm!... So if I forget you to bring a gift are we not friends anymore? Not! This has nothing to do! Of course it has to do! Do you know what's more important to me now than anything? That horse, I believe. There was a time, I thought the same. But now it's more important for you to know, that you don't buy, what you already have: a friend. And there is only one way to prove it. I'll show. We're still friends, aren't we? You can be sure. Go get the horse and let's go home. Fine... See if you can, Miss Murdoc. You will always be welcome here. Thank you, Jim. I can accept, the invitation anytime. Great. Bye. Hey Jim... You were more than fair. I want you to know that I have changed, my reading habits. From Cicero to Mr. Beacher. Not good... I would not leave Cicero out. Each has a different point of view. I think it is important to try to understand both. All aboard. I better go I want to write the last chapter while it's still fresh, in my head. Goodbye, Jim. Thanks for everything. Bye. I hope you come back one day. I believe that I have changed the way of looking at the facts about the West. I found out, that I was a very lucky person. I can understand my family... when young we don't know how to read, who are the real friends. I now see life, from a different angle. "THE END"
