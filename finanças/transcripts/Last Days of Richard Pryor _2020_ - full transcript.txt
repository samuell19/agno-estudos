WHAT WAS THAT [ BLEEP ] YOU SAID LAST FEBRUARY? >> HE CHANGED THE WAY PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT BLACKS, WHITES, THEMSELVES. >> THEY CALL IT AN EPIDEMIC NOW. THAT MEANS WHITE FOLKS ARE DOING IT. >> HIS LIFE CHALLENGED THE STATUS QUO, HIS COMEDY CHALLENGED THE STATUS QUO. >> YOU CAN'T EVEN TALK LIKE THAT NOW. >> YOU EVER NOTICE HOW NICE WHITE PEOPLE GET WHEN THERE'S A BUNK BUNCH OF [ BLEEP ] AROUND? THEY GET OUTSIDE THEY TALK TO EVERYBODY. SAY HI, HOW YOU DOING? I DON'T KNOW YOU BUT HERE'S MY WIFE. HELLO! >> HE WAS REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE, AN ERA, A STRUGGLE, A TIME. >> I JUST LOVED HIM, IMMEDIATELY AND IMMENSELY. >> BEFORE THERE WAS YOUTUBE, BEFORE THERE WAS DIGITAL, BEFORE ANY OF THAT, THERE WAS RICHARD PRYOR. >> WE WENT, WOW. AND THEN LIKE A COMET, IT FLAMED OUT. >> COMEDIAN RICHARD PRYOR IN A CRITICAL CONDITION TONIGHT AND GIVEN LESS THAN A 50/50 CHANCE SURVIVING AFTER SUFFERING THIRD‐DEGREE BURNS OVER HALF OF HIS BODY. >> HE WAS IN A DRUG PSYCHOSIS. I WAS THERE. AND OF COURSE, IT ENDED UP AS A SUICIDE ATTEMPT. >> I WOKE UP IN AN AMBULANCE, RIGHT? AND IT WASN'T NOTHING BUT WHITE PEOPLE STARING AT ME. I SAID AIN'T THIS A BITCH. I DONE DIED AND WOUND UP IN THE WRONG [ BLEEP ] HEAVEN. >> THE FIRST TIME I MET HIM, I FELL MADLY IN LOVE. AND WHAT WAS IT THAT I WAS ATTRACTED TO WAS HIS VULNERABILITY. >> SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A PERSON, RICHARD PRYOR, AND HE DOES ALL THIS COMEDY, HE DOES ALL THIS STUFF, AND THEN THERE'S ME, AND I WONDER WHAT I HAVE TO DO WITH RICHARD. >> IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE TO BE A COMIC. >> I LIVED IN A NEIGHBORHOOD OF A LOT WHOREHOUSES, NOT MANY CANDY STORES OR BANKS, LIQUOR STORES AND WHORE HOUSES. >> YOU HAVE TO EXPOSE YOUR SOUL IN WAYS THAT ARE DANGEROUS TO YOU, AND NOT EVERYONE SURVIVES. >> WHEN CRITICS SAY THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE A GENIUS, DO YOU SAY, YEP, THAT'S ME? >> I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT WHAT MY FATHER CALLED ME. >> WHAT DID YOUR FATHER CALL YOU? NOT THAT. >> DUMB SON OF A BITCH. BUT THE REALITY OF WHAT I AM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY SAY. >> HE APPEARS ON THE RUDY VALLEY SHOW, ON BROADWAY TONIGHT, IT'S HIS TV DEBUT, AND HE SAYS THAT HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT HIS LIFE. >> HE TELLS A COMPLETE STORY ABOUT HIS FAMILY BACKGROUND AND WHERE HE COMES FROM. >> I HAD A WILD NEIGHBORHOOD, I GOT TO TELL YOU, BECAUSE MY MOTHER'S PUERTO RICAN, AND MY FATHER IS A NEGRO, AND WE LIVE IN A REAL BIG JEWISH TENEMENT BUILDING, IN AN ITALIAN NEIGHBORHOOD. EVERY TIME I GO OUTSIDE THESE KIDS SAY "GET HIM! HE'S ALL OF 'EM!" >> BUT IN FACT HE JUST MAKES UP AN ALTERNATIVE RICHARD PRYOR. >> HE WASN'T TO MY KNOWLEDGE PART PUERTO RICAN. HE WAS FROM PEORIA, ILLINOIS, OF FULL AFRICAN DESCENT AND RAISED BY MESSED UP PEOPLE. >> AND I THINK ONE REASON HE DIDN'T TELL PEOPLE THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND IS BECAUSE HE KNEW THEY COULDN'T TAKE IT. >> THAT WILL BE THE STRUGGLE FOR HIM IS TO FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT HE CAN BE A COMEDIAN OR PERFORMER AND TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS LIFE. >> I REMEMBER WHITE PEOPLE USED TO COME DOWN HERE, DO YOU HAVE ANY GIRLS THAT COVER YOU WITH ICE CREAM? AND LITTLE BOYS THAT LICK IT OFF? HE WAS THE MAYOR. >> I HEARD IN THE ALBUMS FIRST, THAT'S HOW I HEARD IT. UP UNTIL THAT POINT, THOSE WERE JOKES. HE TOLD THE JOKES ABOUT WHORE HOUSES AND ALL THOSE THINGS. UNTIL I WENT PEORIA AND ACTUALLY SEEN IT, AND YOU GO, OH, IT'S REAL. >> DECEMBER 1, 1940. I WAS BORN RICHARD FRANKLIN LENNOX THOMAS PRYOR III. I GOT NAMES FROM PIMPS AND GANGSTERS AND ALL THAT. BUCK CARTER'S SON. I COME FROM ROUGH STOCK. >> IF HELL HAD A ZIPCODE, IN 1940s AMERICA, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PEORIA, ILLINOIS. EVERY VICE KNOWN TO MAN WAS COMMONPLACE THERE. >> AND THE REASON THIS IS IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE THIS IS HOW HIS GRANDMOTHER CREATES HER LIVELIHOOD. >> IS IT TRUE THAT YOUR GRANDMOTHER RAN A ‐‐ A HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION? >> SEVERAL. ABOUT THREE. WHOREHOUSES. WHITE FOLKS HAD HOUSES OF PROSTITUTION. AND BLACK PEOPLE HAD WHOREHOUSES. >> SHE WAS THE CHIEF MADAM. >> SHE WAS THE MADAM, NOT THE CHIEF MADAM. >> OKAY, SHE WAS THE MADAM. >> THERE WERE NO OTHERS. MY GRANDMA WAS TOUGH. >> THOSE WERE CALLED FAMILY BUSINESSES BACK IN THOSE DAYS. WHOREHOUSES THAT WERE BEING RUN BY FAMILIES, AND RICHARD WAS JUST ONE OF THEM. >> THOSE WERE IN THE DAYS WHEN THE WOMEN USED TO PECK ON THE WINDOW WITH QUARTERS. FOR PEOPLE, CUSTOMERS. HELLO. HEY, SWEETIE, BABY. THEY'D BE TALKING THROUGH THE WINDOW. NOBODY COULD HEAR THEM ON THE STREETS. >> HE GROWS UP AS THE CHILD OF A PROSTITUTE. A FATHER WHO'S A PIMP. THERE'S CRIMINALITY ALL THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE. >> I MEAN, THAT WAS A BROTHEL WHERE HE WATCHED WHITE MEN COME AND KNOCK ON THE DOOR. "HELLO, IS YOUR MOTHER HOME?" >> ON ONE OF HIS ALBUMS HE SAID, THE LIPS THAT KISSED HIM GOOD NIGHT HAD JUST PERFORMED ORAL SEX ON SOMEBODY. >> I COULD HAVE BEEN PREJUDICED. I COULD HAVE BEEN PREJUDICED. I COULD HAVE BEEN, MAN, BUT I MET NICE WHITE MEN. HELLO, LITTLE BOY, IS YOUR MOTHER HOME? I'D LIKE A [ BLEEP ]. >> IF YOU HAVE TO TELL SOMEONE STRAIGHT WHAT YOUR CHILDHOOD WAS LIKE, DESCRIBE IT. >> IT WAS HELL. BECAUSE I HAD NOBODY TO TALK TO. I WAS A CHILD, ALL RIGHT, AND I GREW UP SEEING MY MOTHER GOING TO ROOMS WITH MEN AND MY AUNTIES GOING TO ROOMS WITH MEN, YOU UNDERSTAND? WHEN I PEEKED THROUGH THE KEYHOLES AND I PEEKED OVER THE TRANSIT, BUT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT UNTIL THIS DAY. AND IT MESSED ME UP. >> RICHARD FOUND OUT WHERE A LOT OF THE RAGE AND PAIN CAME FROM, AND IT WAS PEORIA. >> TO NOT TOTALLY DECAY AND BE FULL OF HATRED WITH THOSE EXPERIENCES AND TO TURN IT INTO COMEDY, THERE'S JUST A GENIUS THERE. THERE'S A GENIUS INSIDE THE LITTLE MOTOR CONTROL THAT YOU'VE SEEN IN CARTOONS WITH THIS WHOLE CREW INSIDE A PERSON'S BRAIN. >> THROUGH THE FORCE OF HIS IMAGINATION AND THE FORCE OF HIS WILL, HE MAKES A WORLD FOR HIMSELF. >> WHO IS CHARLIE EGGER? >> CHARLIE EGGY. >> CHARLIE EGGY. >> THAT'S MY MAGIC FRIEND. I MADE HIM UP. WE USED TO PLAY TOGETHER. SEE, I AM THE SECRET PRINCE. MY MOTHER IS QUEEN U, AND MY FATHER IS KING WHO. MY FATHER LIVE ON LILY PAD WITH A FROG NAMED JIPPIDY‐DOO. SO THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU'RE THE SECRET PRINCE. YOU HAVE TO BE MAGIC. AND YOU PUT MAGIC DUST ON PEOPLE. >> DO YOU PUT MAGIC DUST ON PEOPLE? >> YES, MA'AM. >> ARE YOU MAGIC? >> I'M MAGIC. I'M MAGIC. >> WHO BELIEVED IN YOU? WHO CARED ABOUT YOU? >> RICHARD FRANKLIN LENNOX THOMAS PRYOR III. >> YOU. >> AND MAGIC DUST. >> I WAS IN THE FRONT YARD YOU KNOW, AND ALL THE FAMILY WAS SITTING ON THE PORCH AND THERE WAS SOME DOG POOPOO IN THE FRONT YARD.

YOU GOING TO BUILD A ARK IN? >>> RICHARD PRYOR GROWING UP IN PEORIA, WHO WAS 90% WHITE, HE BEGINS BY GOING TO THE MOVIES AND BEING ENTRANCED BY JERRY LEWIS AND MOVIES LIKE "SAILOR BEWARE." >> YOU BETTER WATCH WHAT YOU'RE DOING. >> STOP THE HEAD, AL, STOP THE HEAD. >> I DON'T LIKE IT HERE. I'M GONNA QUIT. >> "SAILOR BEWARE" WAS THE MOVIE. THERE WAS 300 KIDS WHEN WE LEFT THE THEATRE GOING ‐‐ >> I'M LIKE WATCHING CARTOON AFTER CARTOON AND THINKING "HOW CAN I IMITATE THESE CARTOONISH EXPRESSIONS ON MY FACE?" >> I THINK HE LOOKED AT TELEVISION AND FILMS DIFFERENT THAN OTHER CHILDREN DID. BECAUSE IN HIS EARLY STAGES, HIS VOICES, HIS CHARACTERS, THEY WERE FROM TV. >> SO THAT'S THE COMEDY THAT HE LOVES. IT TENDS TO BE PRETTY ZANY, HIGHLY PHYSICAL AND ANTIC. >> DID YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO BE? >> YEAH. I WAS GOING TO BE RICHARD PRYOR. DUN DUN DUN! I KNEW THAT. SOMETHING IN ME. >> DID YOU KNOW IT WAS GOING TO BE SHOW BUSINESS? >> YEAH. I KNEW SHOW BUSINESS EVEN BEFORE THAT. >> I ASKED HIM, "WHEN DID YOU FIRST FIND OUT YOU WERE FUNNY?" AND HE SAID, WHEN I WAS 4. >> WELL, IN THE EARLY '60s WHEN RICHARD DECIDES HE WANTS TO BECOME A COMIC, IT'S VERY KIND OF FORMALIZED, RIGHT. YOU HAVE THE KIND OF RAT PACK WORLD. YOU HAVE STANDUP COMICS HAVE A CERTAIN VARIETY. IT'S A LOT OF GAGS. >> AT THAT TIME IT WAS STILL THE ALAN KINGS, THE HENNY YOUNGMANS, ROWAN AND MARTINS, THOSE KIND OF GUYS LIKE THAT. >> YOU NEVER DID MEET MY DAUGHTER, DID YOU? FERN, THIS IS DAN. DANK THIS IS FERN. >> BLACK PEOPLE WEREN'T ON TELEVISION, AND IF THEY WERE, UM, THEY WERE USUALLY TRAPPED IN THIS WHITE VERSION OF BLACK AMERICA. >> THE WORLD THAT RICHARD PRYOR WAS COMING UP IN AS A COMEDIAN WAS THE WORLD OF ED SULLIVAN, WHITE GUYS IN SUITS, RIGHT? >> YOU HAVE A KIND OF MONOCULTURE AND LIKE ONE PATH TO TAKE. >> RICHARD PRYOR CAME UP AT A TIME WHERE WHOEVER THE BLACK MAN WAS, ESPECIALLY BACK IN THE DAY THERE WAS ONLY ONE ALLOWED, AND THAT WAS BILL COSBY AT THE TIME. >> BILL COSBY WAS A COLLEGE‐EDUCATED AFRICAN‐AMERICAN MAN. HE WAS SOMEONE THAT WHITE AUDIENCES AT THAT TIME IN THE EARLY 1960s COULD ACCEPT. HE DID COMEDY THAT HAD SOME RACIAL ELEMENTS TO IT, BUT IT WASN'T VERY CONFRONTATIONAL. IT WAS ABOUT FAMILIES. PEOPLE COULD RELATE TO IT NO MATTER WHERE THEY HAD GROWN UP. >> AND I LOOKED AT MY FACE IN THE MIRROR, AND I SEE LITTLE TINY HAIRS GROWING OUT OF MY FACE. >> AND HE'S LIKE, I CAN DO THAT. I CAN DO THAT. AND HE TRIED DO THAT. >> COSBY WASN'T THREATENING. COSBY WAS LIKE THE KIND OF GUY THAT WHITE PEOPLE SAID, "NOW, WHY CAN'T YOU ALL BE LIKE THIS? THIS IS A GUY." >> HE SEES BILL COSBY AND HE THINKS VERY CLEARLY, "I WANT A CHUNK OF THAT." AND HE IS SUCH A GOOD IMPRESSIONIST THAT HE BASICALLY BECOMES A VERSION OF BILL COSBY. >> NOAH. WHO IS THAT? IT'S THE LORD, NOAH. >> WHAT ARE YOU DOING, NOAH? YOU'RE GONNA BUILD AN ARK? IT'S GONNA RAIN 40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS? THAT'S THE SILLIEST THING I EVER ‐‐ >> COSBY, HE TALKED ABOUT COSBY ALL THE TIME AND HOW COOL COSBY WAS. >> WE USED TO IDOLIZE BILL COSBY. >> YEAH. >> WE USED TO GO SEE HIM. HE WAS HOT. THAT WAS SOMETHING. >> DO YOU EVER, EVEN UNCONSCIOUSLY, PICK UP SOMEBODY'S LINE AND USE IT? >> OH, ON PURPOSE. >> OH, I SEE. THAT'S MORE HONEST THAN I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GET. >> PEOPLE SAY, "YOU SOUND LIKE BILL." I SAID "THE HELL YOU MEAN? THIS IS MY VOICE, JACK." SO NO, I DID THAT FOR ‐‐ I MADE A LOT OF MONEY AS BILL COSBY. >> YEAH. >> BUT HE ISN'T LIKE BILL COSBY. >> BILL COSBY MADE HIS COMEDY ACCEPTABLE TO WHITE PEOPLE. IT WAS SAFE. >> THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT BILL COSBY'S UPBRINGING OR LIFE OR CAREER THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH RICHARD PRYOR. >> RICHARD PRYOR FELT LIKE, HEY, MAN, I GOT TO FOLLOW THIS TO MAKE IT. >> AND PRYOR GETS ON THIS PATH AND STARTS APPEARING ON THESE TALK SHOWS AND DOING KIND OF STANDARD COMIC STUFF. >> HE DIDN'T WANNA BE A BILL COSBY, AND YET HE COULD DO BILL COSBY IN A SECOND IF HE WANTED TO. >> IT WAS ALL ABOUT GETTING "AMERICA" TO BE COMFORTABLE ENOUGH WITH YOU TO GIVE YOU SUCCESS. >> RICHARD FELT HE HAD TO PANDER TO THE WHITE AUDIENCE, AND HE HATED HIMSELF FOR IT. >> DO IT. >> WHAT? WHAT? WHAT, MR. GRIFFIN? >> A LITTLE TAP DANCE. MAKE THE TOES CLICK. >> HE WOULD FESTER AND FESTER ABOUT WHAT HE HAD TO DO TO BE RECOGNIZED. BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THAT SHTICK. RICHARD WASN'T INTERESTED IN BEING SAFE, EVER IN HIS LIFE. NEVER. >> HE KIND OF HAS TWO DIFFERENT ACTS. THERE ARE THE ACTS, THE SKITS THAT HE'S, YOU KNOW, HONING SO THAT HE CAN PERFORM ON ED SULLIVAN OR MERV GRIFFIN, YOU KNOW? AND THEN THERE'S THE IMPROV THAT HE'S DOING AT 11:00 P. M., AND HE'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT "HOW DO I PUT THESE THINGS TOGETHER?" >> AND WHEN YOU'RE FINDING YOUR OWN VOICE AND YOU HAVE TO SEARCH FOR THAT, IT'S NOT EASY. THERE'S A PRICE TO PAY. BECAUSE THEY WANT YOU TO BE WHO THEY WERE COMFORTABLE WITH. >> HERE HE IS, OUR OWN LITTLE RICHIE PRYOR. RICHARD! >> BUT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO DO, AND YOU HAVE TO DO IT. >> AND SO HE GOES DOWN TO GREENWICH VILLAGE. >> GREENWICH VILLAGE STARTING IN THE '50s AND MOVING THROUGH THE '60s WAS KIND OF LIKE BOHEMIAN GROUND ZERO IN THE UNITED STATES. >> IN GREENWICH VILLAGE HE FINDS A VERY INTERESTING SCENE. >> YOU HAD A LENNY BRUCE, WHO WAS WORKING IN THE VILLAGE. YOU HAD MORT SAUL, WHO WAS KIND OF DOING TOPICAL HUMOR. YOU HAD DICK GREGORY, ANOTHER AFRICAN AMERICAN COMIC, WHO WAS TRYING TO KIND OF PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT WAS TOPICAL. >> YOU HEARD WHAT BOBBY KENNEDY SAID ABOUT EIGHT WEEKS AGO? HE SAID 30 YEARS FROM THIS YEAR A NEGRO CAN BECOME PRESIDENT, SO TREAT ME RIGHT AND I'LL GET IN THERE AND RAISE TAXES ON YOU. >> THOSE GUYS WERE THE VERY HIP CATS AT THE TIME. CARLIN WAS BIG. AND ALONG CAME LIKE ELAINE BOUSLER. >> SUDDENLY PEOPLE WERE THINKING OF COMING OUT TO SEE COMEDY. >> AND IT BECAME A YOUNG THING. AND RICHARD PRYOR STARTS TO LISTEN TO WHAT HE'S THINKING HIMSELF, AND HE JUST DIGS DEEP INSIDE HIMSELF AND GOES FOR IT. >> AN ARSONIST DOWN IN WATTS DURING THE RIOTS. OKAY? [ SIREN ] ALL RIGHT GET UP TO THE WALL, PEW, PEW, PEW, PEW, PEW. HE AIN'T THE ONE? WELL, LET'S GO. >> HE THOUGHT THAT THROUGH COMEDY, YOU COULD BREAK A LOT OF BARRIERS YOU COULDN'T IN ANY OTHER WAY. AND HE FELT THAT COSBY HAD BEGUN TO DO IT. BUT HE THOUGHT HE WAS LIKABLE AND RICHARD SAID, I REMEMBER THE WORD, HE SAID I'M GOING TO BE UNLIKABLE. I WANT THEM TO FIGHT ME. >> SOMETHING INSIDE ME ‐‐ I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING GOOD THOUGH, WHEN I GET TO IT. >> AT THE END OF THE DAY, IF PROPER SOCIETY OR MAINSTREAM MEDIA DIDN'T EMBRACE RICHARD IT WOULD NOT HAVE CHANGED WHAT HE WAS DOING. >> LET'S ALL GIVE THANKS ON THIS FIRST DAY OF THANKSGIVING, AS WE'RE ALL SO THANKFUL TO BE THANKFUL WE'RE THANKFUL. I KNOW YOU'RE THANKFUL THAT I'M THANKFUL, THAT WE'RE ALL SO THANKFUL. AREN'T YOU THANKFUL? YES, MASSA. >> RICHARD DIDN'T GET IT UNTIL HE LET OUT WHAT HE HAD INSIDE OF HIM AND BECAME THE REAL HONEST RICHARD PRYOR. >> YOU BETTER GET IT TOGETHER. >> BUT HE FOUND IT, DIDN'T HE? HE FOUND HIS WAY. >>> VEGAS NEXT TO NEW YORK IS THE PINNACLE OF THE COMIC WORLD. IT IS WHERE ENTERTAINMENT, LIVE ENTERTAINMENT, LIVES AND THRIVES. IF YOU MAKE IT IN A PLACE LIKE THE ALADDIN, YOU'VE ARRIVED. >> VEGAS WAS EVERYTHING. IT WAS HUGE MONEY IN THOSE DAYS. ALL THOSE CATS WERE MAKING MONEY, AND IT WAS A FABULOUS LIFESTYLE. TONS OF WOMEN. IT WAS A DISNEYLAND FOR EVERYTHING. >> WELCOME TO THE FLAMINGO HOTEL IN GLITTERING LAS VEGAS. >> RICHARD HAS THIS GREAT CONTRACT. HE WAS GOING TO MAKE ALL THIS MONEY, AND HE WAS GONNA BE IN A SHOWROOM, APPEARING. >> YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ANY COMIC. >> HE'S GOT THIS ‐‐ WHAT SHOULD BE, LIKE, A BIG GIG THAT OPENS THINGS UP FOR HIM. BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT THE VEGAS AUDIENCE IS NOT LIKE THE AUDIENCE THAT HE'S ‐‐ HE LOVES THE MOST. >> IMAGINE GUYS IN SHARKSKIN SUITS AND WOMEN WITH BOUFFANT HAIRDOS. THAT'S WHO THE VEGAS CROWD IS, RIGHT? THIS IS NOT A MIXED RACE CROWD. THIS IS LAS VEGAS CIRCA 1967. >> IT WAS AN ALL‐WHITE TOWN, PERIOD. AND IT WAS A VERY, VERY RACIST CITY, LAS VEGAS. THERE WAS NO BLACK PEOPLE WORKING IN ‐‐ ON THE STRIP IN LAS VEGAS. THERE WERE NO DEALERS. THERE WERE NO DOORMEN. THERE WERE NO MANAGERS. THERE WERE NO HOTEL CLERKS. THERE WERE NO COCKTAIL WAITRESSES. THERE WERE NO BLACKS IN THE HOTELS ON THE STRIP. >> WELL, LAS VEGAS WAS A PLACE WHERE HIGH ROLLERS WENT TO SEE ENTERTAINMENT LIKE THE RAT PACK. BUT THE KIND OF CASUAL RACIAL SLURS THAT DEAN AND FRANK DELIVER ON TO SAMMY WITH A JOKE AND A KIND OF WINK JUST SEEM APPALLING NOWADAYS. >> I'D LIKE TO THANK THE NAACP FOR THIS WONDERFUL TROPHY. >> I WAS THE OPENING ACT FOR THE CARPENTERS, ABBA, JOEL GREY, PETULA CLARK. YOU WEREN'T OPENING FOR ACTS THAT BROUGHT IN ANY BLACK PEOPLE. >> SO, IMAGINE RICHARD PRYOR, AND YOU'RE SUDDENLY IN VEGAS, AND YOU WANT TO SHOW THEM WHAT YOU CAN DO. YOU WANT TO BE THE PERSON THAT YOU ARE, BUT YOU GOT THESE RULES. YOU CAN'T CURSE. >> EVERYBODY WAS TOLD TO BE TOTALLY CLEAN. NO DIRT AT ALL. OTHERWISE YOU'LL NEVER WORK. >> YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT BEING RAISED IN A BROTHEL. YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT DRUG USE AND SCREWED UP RELATIONSHIPS. YOU DON'T. >> AND THEN YOU LOOK OUT IN THE AUDIENCE, AND IT'S ALL WHITE PEOPLE. YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT AND FIGURE OUT, WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT AM I DOING HERE? THIS IS NOT ‐‐ AM I SUPPOSED TO BE HERE? AM I SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THIS? IT JUST SORT OF DOESN'T GEL. SO THERE'S THIS UNDERLYING, UNEASY THING THAT HAPPENED WITH RICHARD IN LAS VEGAS. >> YOU LIVE BEING BLACK IN A BLACK WORLD, BUT WHEN YOU START INTERACTING IN A WHITE WORLD, YOU HAD TO PUT ON A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE. YOU'D HAVE TO PROTECT YOURSELF. YOU'D HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY AND HOW YOU SAY IT. >> I WASN'T COURAGEOUS OR HONEST SOMETIMES. I WOULD GET A LAUGH AND FEEL SAFE THERE, AND I WOULDN'T GO ANY FURTHER. I WOULD SAY [ BLEEP ] IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO GET THIS LAUGH. LEAVE IT AT THAT. >> AND SO, RICHARD WAS TRAPPED IN THIS WORLD THAT CERTAINLY DIDN'T FIT HIS CREATIVITY OR HIS IMAGINATION. AND I THINK HE HAD ENOUGH. >> IN PRYOR'S CASE, THERE'S A FAMOUS KIND OF EPIPHANY. >> HE WAS IN VEGAS, AND HE LOOKED INTO THE EYES OF DEAN MARTIN, WHO WAS IN THE AUDIENCE, AND APPARENTLY, HE SAID DEAN WAS LOOKING AT HIM WITH THIS LOOK OF LIKE, WHAT THE [ BLEEP ] ARE YOU DOING? AND RICHARD OBVIOUSLY INTERNALIZED THAT QUESTION IMMEDIATELY AND WALKED OFF STAGE. >> AND I THINK IN ONE FELL SWOOP, IN ONE MOMENT, HE JUST WENT, I GOT TO LET THE GENIE OUT OF THE BOTTLE. I CAN'T DO THIS. IT'S LIKE A PRIMAL SCREAM. HE JUST WENT [ BLEEP ] YOU KNOW? THAT'S NOT ME. >> I'M SURE THE AGENT TO THIS DAY IS PROBABLY HANGING IN HIS OFFICE BY A NOOSE OR SOMETHING GOING, OH, MY GOD, HE BLEW ALL THIS MONEY. >> AT THAT POINT IN HIS LIFE, HE WAS KIND OF SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL. HE HAD HAD SOME SUCCESSES BUT THEY WEREN'T SATISFYING TO HIM. WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS, LIKE, GUEST SPOTS ON "THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY." >> I KNOW IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS, BUT I KEEP WONDERING WHY YOU WANT TO BEAT UP VEGETABLES? >> BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY THING I CAN BRUISE THAT WON'T BRUISE ME BACK. >> THAT WAS THE LAST THING HE DID, AND HE'S LIKE, "IS THAT WHAT I WANT TO BE KNOWN FOR?" >> I COULD FEEL THE STIRRINGS OF AN IDENTITY CRISIS. IT WAS COMING ON LIKE THE BEGINNING OF AN ACID TRIP. MAKE UP, RICHARD. YES, YOU'RE AN IGNORANT JERK, PUMPING YOUR ‐‐ LIKE A CHEAP ‐‐ BUT YOU HAVE A BRAIN. USE IT. >> IF YOU CHOOSE TO MOVE TO BERKELEY YOU ARE DUNKING YOURSELF HEAD FIRST INTO A WHOLE DIFFERENT WORLD. >> BERKELEY IS REALLY THE EPICENTER OF BOTH THE COUNTERCULTURE AT THE TIME AND OF THE BLACK POWER MOVEMENT. >> THAT PERIOD OF TIME, THE WORLD WAS BLOWING UP. PATTY HEARST WAS KIDNAPPED. THE CHICAGO RIOTS. THERE WAS SO MUCH GOING ON. >> KING'S DEATH. KENNEDY'S DEATH. >> WE WERE A NATION DIVIDED ALONG RACIAL LINES, DIVIDED OVER THE WAR. AND RICHARD PRYOR CAME ALONG INTO THIS ANGRY SOUNDTRACK IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND ADDED A LAUGH TRACK. >> BLACK POWER'S JUST A WORD. YOU ALL GET UPTIGHT. BLACK POWER'S COMING. BLACK POWER'S COMING! ANYWAY, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM THE BLACK MAN EXCEPT HIS THOUGHTS. THAT'S ENOUGH! >> THE VOICE OF THOSE TIMES WAS REALLY HEARD IN MUSIC. ♪♪ THAT WAS THE NEW AGE, AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WERE LISTENING TO. ♪♪ WELL, HIS MUSIC IS HIS VOICE, IS HIS COMEDY. >> NEGROES CAN'T GO TO HEAVEN. THEY CAN GET A PROMISE OF HEAVEN. I WAS A NEGRO FOR 23 YEARS. I GAVE THAT [ BLEEP ] UP. NO ROOM FOR ADVANCEMENT. >> AND IT WAS ALARMING TO PEOPLE. BUT, YOU KNOW, THE HIP CATS IN JAZZ TYPE CLUBS GOT IT, THAT THIS IS A NEW WORLD. >> HE WASN'T DOING, YOU KNOW, THE BILL COSBY ROUTINES ANYMORE. YOU KNOW, "LIVE AND SMOKIN'" WAS ‐‐ HE SHOT THAT IN 1971, AND THAT'S HARDCORE. AND YOU COULD SEE, "OH, HELL, WE'RE IN FOR A RIDE HERE." >> MY DADDY TOLD ME HE DON'T WANT TO SEE ME INTO THE CITY JUST BECAUSE I STOLE HIS TELEVISION. >> AND THAT'S WHEN HIS JOKES BECAME MORE ABOUT WHAT I DID. THEN IT BECAME PERSONAL. THEN THE JOKES ELEVATED, BECAME REAL. >> HIS FIRST INITIAL APPEARANCES WERE SO STRONG, SO RAW, IT REMINDED ME ‐‐ THE CLOSEST I COULD THINK OF IS WHEN JIMI HENDRIX FIRST HIT THE UNITED STATES. PEOPLE JUST WENT, OH, MY GOD! WHAT IS THIS? >> YEAH, BOY, I GOT SOME. I GOT SOME ADVICE FOR YOUR ‐‐ YOU BETTER LAY OFF THAT NARCOTICS [ BLEEP ] THAT MADE YOU NULL AND VOID. >> GETTING ON STAGE IS HARD FOR ANYBODY. BUT DOING WHAT RICHARD DID WAS REALLY HARD, I THINK. >> CAN'T GET ARRESTED FOR DRINKING NOTHING. [ LAUGHTER ] >> RICHARD TALKED ABOUT HIMSELF AND HIS TRUTH. WHERE HE CAME FROM, WHERE HE WANTED TO GO. WHO HE WAS AS A HUMAN BEING. WHAT AMERICA WAS. >> HE CAME BACK SMOKING MORE JOINTS THAN EVER, DOING COCAINE, MORE WOMEN. BUT WITH THAT CAME A HEAVY, HEAVY DRUG THING. HE WAS ALWAYS DOING DRUGS, BUT NOT LIKE THIS. >> I'M REALLY NERVOUS BECAUSE I AIN'T HAD NO COCAINE ALL DAY. LOVE COCAINE. >>> AS THE 60S MOVES ON AND AS THE COUNTER CULTURE GROWS, NOT JUST IN MUSIC OR POLITICS OR CIVIL RIGHTS, BUT IN PLACES LIKE COMEDY, THE SOCIETY IS BEING REFLECTED IN THE ARTS. >> THE PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY FEEL THEY HAVE BEEN TREATED UNFAIRLY. >> POLICE JUMPED OUT THE CAR, TWO GRAB YOUR LEGS, ONE GRAB YOUR HEAD AND SNAP, "OH HE [ BLEEP ] HE BROKE. CAN YOU [ BLEEP ] OKAY? >> RICHIE, WAS COMING FROM THE JIM CROW TIME, ANOTHER PAIN, A MUCH DEEPER PAIN. PAIN THAT HE KNEW IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS, THOSE PEOPLE NEVER SEEN. HE KNOWS THAT FROM THE TIMELINE HE'S FROM, AND THEN PROBABLY FROM THE PART OF THE COUNTRY HE'S FROM. SO YOU TAKE ALL OF THAT, AND YOU HEAR FROM YOUR GRANDMOTHER AND GRANDFATHER THESE TYPE OF KILLINGS, HANGINGS, WHATEVER STORIES WAS TOLD THEN, YOU BRING IT ALL THE WAY WITH YOU TO RIGHT NOW, AND YOU STILL SEE IT. >> POLICE GOT A CHOKE HOLD THAT THEY USE OUT HERE THOUGH ON YOU MAN, THEY CHOKE [ BLEEP ] TO DEATH. YOU BE DEAD WHEN THEY THROUGH. DID YOU KNOW THAT? WAIT A MINUTE [ BLEEP ] GOING, "YEAH WE KNOW." WHITE FOLKS GOING, "OH NO, I HAD NO IDEA." >> RICHARD WAS ARRESTED A FEW TIMES. ONE TIME HE WAS ARRESTED IN PITTSBURGH 1963, AND ON THE MUGSHOT IT SAYS "EYES, MAROON. HAIR, KINKY." >> I KNOW THE FACTS OF LIFE MAN, I'M A BLACK MAN, BUT I'M A MAN. AND IF YOU CAN SEE THE MAN IN ME BEFORE YOU SEE THE BLACK, GOD BLESS YOU, BECAUSE THEN WE CAN DEAL. >> BACK THEN WE NEEDED TO SEE AGGRESSION, WE NEEDED TO SEE RESISTANCE, WE NEEDED TO SEE A WARRIOR. >> THERE WAS SUCH PRESSURE ON HIM AT THAT TIME TO BE THE NEW BLACK VOICE. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS DEAD, MALCOM X WAS DEAD, SO THEY WANTED RICHARD TO BE IT. HE DIDN'T WANT THE JOB. THE DRUGS WERE JUST A PANACEA, JUST A CURE FOR EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON, ALL OF IT THIS, JUST ‐‐ OH, THAT PRESSURE. >> DOPE DEALERS. I DID IT SO BAD, DOPE DEALERS TRIED NOT TO SELL ME NOTHING. NOW THAT'S DOING IT WHEN DOPE DEALERS SAY, I AIN'T GOING TO GIVE YOU NO MORE. >> OUR FIRST REAL DATE, HE TOOK ME TO A DRUG DEALER IN SAN FRANCISCO, AND TO BUY COCAINE. AND THEN WE WENT TO ‐‐ HE TOOK ME TO A MOVIE. I'D NEVER EVEN SPOKEN TO A BLACK MAN, LET ALONE KISSED ONE OR HAD SEX WITH ONE, AND IT WAS LIKE ‐‐ IT WAS A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME, AND I WAS JUST INFATUATED WITH HIM. THAT'S HOW HE MET AND WHAT OUR LIFE WAS LIKE. >> LOOK, I LIKE DRUGS. I DO. PEOPLE CALL THEM DRUGS, RIGHT? BUT I LIKE COCAINE EVERY NOW AND THEN, SIT AROUND MY FRIENDS AND GET HIGH. >> YOU MIGHT STILL. >> MIGHT STILL? >> DO STILL. >> AND RICHARD HAD ENDLESS MONEY FOR IT. RICHARD COULD GO AND BUY A POUND OF COCAINE, AND THEN HE WAS JUST SNORTING IT AND SNORTING IT. >> WE'D GO TO HIS HOUSE UP IN NORTHRIDGE, RIGHT? AND HE'D HAVE A TABLE FULL OF COKE. AND HE'D SAY, "HEY MAN, THIS TABLE HERE, THIS IS MORE THAN YOU'LL EVER MAKE IN YOUR LIFETIME. >> HIS HABIT WAS MAYBE 20 GRAND A MONTH. WELL, HOW LONG DO YOU THINK HE COULD DO THAT? >> EVERY TIME I GET IN TROUBLE IT'S BECAUSE I END UP DRINKING TOO MUCH OR I END UP SNORTING TOO MUCH OR SMOKING TOO MUCH. BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS ‐‐ LIKE, LOOK I LIKE DRUGS, I DO. >> COCAINE'S A HELL OF A DRUG, YOU KNOW? AND IT GIVES YOU 20 MINUTES OF EGO. AND SO I THINK THAT'S MAYBE WHY SO MANY COMEDIANS WOULD TURN TO IT, ESPECIALLY, AFTER A SHOW WHEN YOU'RE COMING DOWN FROM THE SHOW. YOU DON'T WANT TO HIGH TO END, SO YOU TURN TO SOMETHING. >> HE WAS NOT HAPPY WITH HIS LIFE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY HE HAD EARNED OR WHAT KIND OF SUCCESS HE HAD ATTAINED. >> I THINK PROBABLY IN THIS DAY AND AGE, IN THIS CONTEXT, HE'D BE ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS INSTEAD OF,EN WHY, VODKA, VODKA, VODKA. >> AND AGAIN, IT GOES BACK TO HIS CHILDHOOD. THE WAY HE WAS RAISED. >> WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM AS A CHILD WAS NEVER FIXED. >> JUST WATCHING HIS MOTHER BE A WHORE HAD TO AFFECT HIM AS A MATURE ADULT MAN. >> IMAGINE BEING A BEAUTIFUL VASE THAT EVERYBODY LOVES, BUT THERE'S A CRACK IN IT. SOMEBODY DROPPED IT. AND THAT WAS RICHARD PRYOR. EVERY TIME IT BROKE, IT BROKE IN THE SAME PLACE. CHILDHOOD. >> MY GRANDMOTHER WOULD WAKE MY ASS UP. YOU KNOW, "GET YO ASS OUT, PUT YOUR HAND ‐‐ PUT YOUR HAND ‐‐ DON'T YOU RUN FROM ME, DON'T YOU RUN FROM ME. AS LONG AS YOU BLACK, DON'T YOU RUN FROM ME. >> THE GRANDMOTHER, REALLY, SHE WAS THE MATRIARCH OF THE FAMILY. SHE RAN IT WITH AN IRON HAND, AND SHE DIDN'T SUFFER FOOLS. INCLUDING HIM. >> EVEN THOUGH SHE BEAT THE [ BLEEP ] OUT OF HIM, SHE WAS STILL THE ONLY ONE THAT HE FELT LOVED HIM. >> A STAR WITH A BROKEN CHILDHOOD. HE WAS WALKING AROUND WITH BLEW. WE WAS LAUGHING BUT HE WAS DYING INSIDE. >> YOU COULDN'T FILL THE HOLE, YOU COULDN'T, THERE'S NOTHING YOU COULD DO. AND HE WOULDN'T LET YOU. HE WOULDN'T EVEN LET YOU TRY. YOU'RE NOT COMING IN HERE AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SAVE ME AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RESCUE ME. FORGET THAT. >> IT'S SUCH A DOUBLE‐EDGED SWORD, BECAUSE A LOT OF HIS HUMOR CAME FROM THAT FAMILY TOO. >> BOY, WHAT'S THAT YOU'RE PUTTING UP YOUR NOSE? I SAID COCAINE, MAMA. JESUS, GOD, TAKE ME NOW LORD, TAKE MY NOW. GOD, SAVE MY LIFE. TAKE ME, TAKE ME, TAKE ME. >> RICHARD COMES ON AND GOES, WAIT A MINUTE. THAT'S ME. THAT HAPPENED TO ME. THAT'S MY LIFE. >> I SAID, MAMA DON'T DO IT. $1,600 WORTH DOWN THE DRAIN. >> THESE WERE VOICES AND ATTITUDES THAT WERE NEVER DONE BEFORE. >> HERE IS THE BROTHEL, DRUGS, PEOPLE GETTING SHOT, STABBED, PROSTITUTES, HOMOSEXUALITY, WHATEVER. >> THESE ARE FUNNY CHARACTERS HE'S DOING, BUT THEY'RE REAL. THIS IS A FUNNY SITUATION THAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT, BUT IT'S REAL. >> [ BLEEP ]. YOU DON'T COME DRIVING AROUND THROW HERE LIKE YOU CRAZY. THIS IS A NEIGHBORHOOD MAN. THIS IS A RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT. >> I RELATED TO HIM. I WASN'T A SMALL BLACK CHILD, I WASN'T, I DIDN'T GROW UP NEAR PROSTITUTES, BUT SOMEHOW I GOT HIM. >> IMMA DO IT WITH YOU BOY, IMMA WALK WIT' YA, 'CAUSE I BELIEVE YOU GOT POTENTIAL. >> THEN HE'D SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT, "I WANNA WALK WIT' YOU BOY, TALK WIT' YOU CAUSE I THINK YOU'VE GOT POTENTIAL." I MEAN, HE SAID THINGS IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU JUST OPEN YOUR HEART TO EVERYONE. >> RICHARD PRYOR HAD SEVEN MARRIAGES TO FIVE WOMEN. TWO OF THEM TWICE. >>> I DEFINITELY FELT THAT RICHARD WAS MY SOUL MATE, LOVE OF MY LIFE. THAT'S WHY I MARRIED HIM TWICE. >> RICHARD PRYOR HAD SEVEN MARRIAGES TO FIVE WOMEN, TWO OF THEM TWICE. >> RICHARD PRYOR FIST WIFE WAS PATRICIA PRICE. >> AND THEN HE MARRIED SHELLEY, AFTER SHELLEY CAME DEBORAH, AFTER DEBORAH, ME, AND THEN AFTER ME, FLYNN. AND THEN ME. HOW MANY TIMES ITS THAT? >> RICHARD PRYOR AND WOMEN. OH, MAN. >> SO HE HAD A LOT OF WOMEN AND A LOT OF WIVES AND A LOT OF CHILDREN. HE WAS NOT ALONE IN THAT IN THE ENTERTAINMENT WORLD. BUT HE TALKED ABOUT IT. >> I REALLY AM TRYING. I REALLY AM TRYING. I'M TELLING YOU, I'M [ BLEEP ] TRYING, OKAY? BUT IT'S HARD TO WAKE UP AND SEE THE SAME PERSON ALL THE [ BLEEP ] TIME. >> HE SAID YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP WITH THE SAME PERSON DAY AFTER DAY. SO REALLY WHAT HE WAS ADDRESSING WAS THE KIND OF BOREDOM OF DAY‐TO‐DAY LIVING. RICHARD HAD A HARD TIME KNOWING THAT AND LIVING A KIND OF, YOU KNOW, EXISTENCE THAT WASN'T A PARTY EVERY DAY. >> THE NIGHT AFTER HE WAS MARRIED WITH JENNIFER, HE KNOCKED AN HIS LAWYER'S DOOR AND SAID, I WANT A DIVORCE. THE FOLLOWING MORNING. >> THAT WAS BECAUSE RICHARD FELT THAT IT WAS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO CONQUER YOU. >> IT WAS A GAME WITH HIM. IT WAS A SPORT. >> AND THEN ONCE YOU GAVE IN, WELL, NOW THE INTEREST WAS VERY MUCH LESS. >> IT'S A RESULT OF WHAT HE WAS EXPOSED TO IN PEORIA, WHERE YOU GREW UP IN A WHORE HOUSE, AND THERE'S LIES, THERE'S CHEATING, AND THERE'S ALL OF THOSE THINGS IN THAT WORLD. WHAT HE SEEN THERE IMPRESSED ON HIS MIND HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT WOMEN. >> so IT'S COMPLEX FOR RICHARD BECAUSE HE NEVER HAD THE NORMAL KIND OF UPBRINGING THAT ALL OF US NICE MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE HAD. >> HOW DO YOU GROW UP LIKING WOMEN WHEN YOU'RE BORN AND BROUGHT UP IN A HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION? >> I WOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD THINK THAT EVERY WOMAN WAS ON THE MAKE OR ON THE TAKE. >> I DID. >> SOME OF THE MISTRUST HE MAY HAVE HAD WITH HIS WIVES OF WOMEN HE WAS WITH WAS AS A RESULT OF WHAT HE IS EXPOSED TO BUT WHEN HE WAS EXPOSED TO IT, IT WAS IN PEORIA. >> HIS MOTHER ACTUALLY RAN AWAY FROM THE BROTHEL WHEN HE WAS ONLY 5 OR 6. BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE PART OF THAT LIFE. >> WHAT DOES IT DO TO A KID WHEN HIS MOTHER LEAVES WHEN HE'S 6? >> I HATED HER. >> YOU HATED HER. >> YEAH. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY SHE'D LEAVE ME WITH THEM. >> RICHARD COULD NOT TRUST THAT BETRAYAL WASN'T RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. AS A RESULT, HE BETRAYED PEOPLE. AS A RESULT, HE PUNISHED PEOPLE FOR REAL OR IMAGINED BETRAYAL. >> PRYOR TELLS A STORY IN HIS LIVE IN CONCERT SPECIAL ABOUT GETTING ARRESTED FOR KILLING A CAR, IS HOW HE PUTS IT. >> HE WAS MAD WITH HIS LADY AND HE SHOT HER CAR ‐‐ [ LAUGHTER ] ‐‐ WITH A .357 MAGNUM. >> AND IT SEEMED FAIR TO KILL MY CAR TO ME, RIGHT? BECAUSE MY WIFE WAS GON' LEAVE MY ASS, AND I SAID NOT IN THIS [ BLEEP ] YOU AIN'T. NO, LORD. YOU LEAVE, YOU BE DRIVIN' THOSE HUSH PUPPIES YOU GOT ON. >> IF SHE HAD JUST RAN DOWN THE DRIVEWAY, SHE WOULD HAVE GOT AWAY, BUT THE FACT THAT SHE TRIED TO GET AWAY WITH THE MERCEDES, WAIT A DAMN MINUTE. >> THEN THE POLICE CAME, AND I WENT IN THE HOUSE, BECAUSE THEY GOT MAGNUMS, TOO, AND THEY DON'T KILL CARS. THEY KILL [ BLEEP ]. >> IT WAS SO FUNNY. THE TIMING OF IT, THE SOUNDS THAT HE'S FIGURED OUT TO MAKE, AND NOW WATCHING THAT YOU'RE THINKING, HIS WIFE MUST HAVE BEEN TERRIFIED. >> BECAUSE HE HAD BEATEN HER, SO SHE WAS RUNNING AWAY, SO THE ONLY CAR SHE HAD HER HANDS ON WAS THE MERCEDES. >> IN TERMS OF HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WOMEN IN HIS LIFE, I THINK THAT THE CLOSER THEY CAME TO HIM, THE MORE UGLINESS THEY EXPERIENCED. JUST AS HE HAD LIVED IN FEAR WHEN HE WAS GROWING UP. >> RICHARD HAD A SIMMERING RAGE ALL THE TIME. IT WAS JUST SOMETHING INNATE WITH HIM, LIKE A GENETIC DEFECT. >> HE LEARNED FROM HIS CHILDHOOD THAT LOVE WAS TANGLED UP IN VIOLENCE, AND HE NEVER COULD QUITE SEPARATE THOSE IN TERMS OF HIS RELATIONSHIPS WITH WOMEN. >> THE MACK REALLY HIT HOME FOR RICHARD IN THE SENSE THAT IT WAS ABOUT A PIMP. >> SHE IS FINE. >> I'M FENNISHED, BUT I'LL LET YOU HAVE HER. >> HE FOUND HIMSELF IMMERSED BACK IN THAT LIFE, THAT PIMP LIFE OF HIS FATHER AND HIS UNCLE. >> YA' KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I'M TALKING ABOUT PLAYERS. THEY AIN'T NO PLAYAS, I'M DRUNK. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? >> IT DIDN'T GO WELL. WHEN WE CAME BACK TO HOTEL, WE HAD NO MONEY. SO HE DECIDED THAT HE WANTED ME TO GO TO THE BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL AND FIND A TRICK AND BRING HOME THE MONEY. I TRIED. I MEAN, I GOT IN THE CAR AND I DROVE TO THE BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL. AND FINALLY I DECIDED I COULDN'T DO IT. AND WHEN I DROVE HOME, RICHARD WAS ENRAGED THAT HIS ATTEMPT AT PIMPING ME DID NOT WORK. HE HAD BEEN DRINKING COURVOISIER. HE ALREADY HAD PLENTY OF DRUGS IN HIS SYSTEM, AND HE STARTED BEATING ME WITH THE COURVOISIER BOTTLE. >> AND THESE ARE HORRIBLE MOMENTS. VERY DAMAGING MOMENTS FOR THE WOMEN WHO ‐‐ WHO WANTED TO LOVE HIM. >> HE LEARNED IT FROM HIS FATHER. HIS FATHER WAS NOT ONLY VIOLENT WITH WOMEN, BUT HIS FATHER WAS VIOLENT WITH HIM. >> MY FATHER WAS SCARY, BOY. I'D PISS ON MYSELF SOMETIMES WHEN HE'D CALL MY ‐‐ RICHARD! HUH? >> I THINK IT WAS VERY EASY FOR HIM TO ‐‐ TO STRIKE OUT WITHOUT THINKING. AND THEN HE WAS ALWAYS CONTRITE AND ALWAYS SORRY. >> HE FELL TO THE FLOOR AND STARTED BEGGING ME, MAMA, HELP ME. MAMA, I'M SICK, HELP ME. AND HE PASSED OUT. >> BUT, YEAH, I FOUGHT BACK. I WAS ONE OF THE ONES WHO FIGHT BACK. THEY SAY ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, THAT THE WOMEN WHO FIGHT BACK EITHER END UP LEAVING OR KILLING. SO BASICALLY, I YOU KNOW, I HAD TO GET OUT OF DODGE. BUT I UNDERSTOOD THAT ANGER. WHEN HE COULD CHANNEL IT WAS WHEN HE WAS BRILLIANT. >> AND I HAD A FIGHT WITH MY FATHER ONE TIME. YOU KNOW, WASN'T EXACTLY A FIGHT, BUT I DID THE BEST I COULD. AND HE HIT ME IN THE CHEST, HE HIT ME SO HARD, MY CHEST JUST CAVED IN AND WRAPPED AROUND HIS FIST. AND I HELD ON TO IT WITH MY CHEST. I WOULD NOT LET IT GO SO HE COULD HIT MY ASS AGAIN. AND EVERYWHERE HE MOVED HIS ARM, I WAS HANGING ON. LIKE THIS. >> YOU KNOW THAT THE PATH TO THAT JOKE WAS PAINFUL, AND THE WORLD IS LAUGHING. >> THE N‐WORD. >> THE N‐WORD. >> THAT N‐WORD. >> WAIT A MINUTE. >> I BEG YOUR PARDON. >> YOU CAN'T USE IT, I CAN USE IT. THE END. >>> GOOD EVENING, LANG LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AND WELCOME TO "THE RICHARD PRYOR SHOW." >> THIS IS SOMETHING NOBODY HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE. >> IT WAS REAL. >> [ BLEEP ]. >> WHAT? >> THAT LITTLE BOX COULDN'T HOLD RICHARD PRYOR. >> WHEN HE STARTED TO DO MOVIES AND MAKE THESE BIG PAYCHECKS I THINK HE DID FEEL AS IF HE WERE COMPROMISING. >> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS MOVIE? IT SUCKS. >> THAT'S BASICALLY WHEN ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE. >> HE SAID HE WAS GOING KILL HIMSELF. >> WHEN THAT FIRE HITS YOUR ASS THAT WILL SOBER YOUR ASS UP QUICK. >> COULD HAVE HAD IT ALL, LIKE THAT SONG SAYS. AND BECAUSE OF THE DRUGS, WE DIDN'T. WE LOST IT. >> WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY. >> RICHARD WAS MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE. >> AIN'T NOBODY MESSING WITH YOU. TURN YOUR HEAD AROUND. >> BREAK INTO CHARACTER. THAT'S WHAT A REAL GOOD COMIC DOES. >> YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? >> I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE IN HIS HEAD HE THOUGHT HE WAS, BUT BECAUSE OF THAT HIS TALENTED INTRODUCED US TO SO MANY THINGS. >> I LOVE WHEN WHITE DUDES GET MAD AND CUSS. Y'ALL ARE SOME FUNNY [ BLEEP ] WHEN YOU CUSS. YEAH, COME ON, PECKERHEAD. >> PROFANITY. YEAH. HERE COMES RICHARD PRYOR WITH THE "MF" WORD, WITH THE "F" WORD, WITH EVERYTHING YOU COULD HAVE. AND YOU KNOW, I EVEN HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT I THOUGHT, "WELL, IS THIS OKAY? WHAT'S THIS?" >> WELL, THE LANGUAGE, TO ME, WAS THE LANGUAGE OF THE STREET. >> STUCK TO THE DIALOGUE, SAYING THE STUFF THAT, IT'S TABOO. >> AIN'T NO WAY TO GET AN AMBULANCE OUT IN THE GHETTO UNLESS YOU CALL, THIS [ BLEEP ] IS KILLING A WHITE WOMAN, WHERE'S THE BODY? >> DURING THOSE DAYS, THE PREMIERE WAY OF AMASSING AN AUDIENCE WAS TO PUT OUT A COMEDY RECORD. >> I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SAY IT NOW BUT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I COULD EVEN TELL YOU, YOU KNOW WHAT MY FAVORITE ALBUM WAS? AND IT WAS ‐‐ >> THAT'S HOW THE TITLE OF THAT N‐WORD IS CRAZY CAME INTO THE LEXICON OF COMEDY. >> ON TOWER RECORDS ON SUNSET BOULEVARD, THAT WAS THE BILLBOARD WITH NO PIXILATION. HE CHANGED EVERYTHING. >> THE RECORD CAME OUT AND WAS AN INSTANTANEOUS HIT. >> SOME DUDES WOULD TALK TO YOU WHILE THEY KICKED YOUR ‐‐ RIGHT? WHAT YOU WANT WITH ME, MAN? >> SO HE'S ON DINAH SHORE. I MEAN, SHE IS THE EPITOME OF A KIND OF LILY WHITE SENSIBILITY. >> I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE TITLE OF YOUR ALBUM, BUT I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SAY. >> YOU DO? FOR MOST WHITE PEOPLE IT'S HARD TO SAY CRAZY. >> WELL, YOU TELL THEM THE TITLE OF THE ALBUM, I CAN'T SAY IT. >> THE TITLE OF THE ALBUM IS "THAT [ BLEEP ] CRAZY", AND DON'T THAT [ BLEEP ] LOOK CRAZY? >> SEE NOW YOU CAN JUST SAY THAT AND TALK ‐‐ IF I SAID THAT WOULDN'T YOU GET MAD? >> I'D PUNCH YOU OUT. >> WHAT HE'S DOING IS HE'S WAVING IN FRONT OF PEOPLE SAYING, I KNOW YOU SAY THIS WORD. YOU MAY NOT SAY IT ON DINAH SHORE'S SHOW AND DINAH MIGHT NOT SAY IT, BUT THIS IS A WORD THAT YOU USE. AND NOW I'M GOING TO USE IT AND BY USING IT, I AM MAYBE OUTRAGING YOU SHOCKING YOU ANNOYING YOU. BUT YOU CAN'T HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS WORD IS OUT THERE. >> YOU EVER NOTICE HOW NICE WHITE PEOPLE GET WHEN THERE'S A BUNCH OF [ BLEEP ] AROUND? RIGHT? THEY GET OUTSIDE THEY TALK TO EVERYBODY. HI, HOW YOU DOING? I DON'T KNOW YOU, BUT HERE'S MY WIFE. HELLO! >> HE WAS ALWAYS SPEAKING FOR THE PEOPLE. MAKE EVERYBODY LOOK AROUND. OH, DID YOU HEAR THAT? I'M COMING BACK NEXT WEEK. I WANT TO HEAR THAT AGAIN. >> I HATE THIS CONVERSATION. THE N WORD. WHICH I'VE SAID ISN'T THAT JUST AS BAD AS THE ACTUAL WORD? >> THAT WAS SOMETIMES HISTORICALLY THE LAST WORD THAT YOU HEARD BEFORE YOU WAS KILLED. >> YOU CAN'T USE IT. I CAN USE IT. THE END. >> HELL, NO. OH, YOU KNOW THAT I COULDN'T USE THAT WORD. >> THERE'S JUST RULES THAT ARE WRITTEN IN THIS SOCIETY THAT ARE INVISIBLY WRITTEN, BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THEY'RE THERE. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SAY THAT TO ME. PERIOD. >> WHY SHOULD THERE BE AN UNSPEAKABLE WORD? >> CAN YOU BRING [ BLEEP ] IN OKAY? LET'S CHECK THE MANUAL. YEP, PAGE 8, YOU CAN BRING THEM RIGHT THERE, SEE? LET'S DRAG 'EM DOWN TOWN, OKAY. >> AT THE TIME THAT WAS ALL PART OF THE BLACK MAN BEING REBELLIOUS. IT SHOWED THAT HE WAS A REBEL. YOU DIDN'T CARE WHAT NOBODY SAID. >> RICHARD HAD BRAVERY TO GO THE OTHER DIRECTION AND TO USE THE N‐WORD. THAT WAS THE ANGER. AND A LOT OF COMEDY DOES COME FROM ANGER. IT COMES FROM INJUSTICE. IT COMES FROM HOW YOU'VE BEEN TREATED. >> IT'S ALWAYS BEEN OKAY FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO SAY IT TO EACH OTHER, BECAUSE IT'S JUST SORT OF A FUNNY SLANG. BUT WHEN IT'S NOT OKAY IS WHEN A WHITE PERSON CALLS A BLACK PERSON THAT, BECAUSE IT'S COMING FROM A DIFFERENT MINDSET. >> WHEN YOU'RE ON STAGE WHY IS IT SO MUCH A PART OF YOUR PERFORMANCE? >> I DON'T KNOW WHY. >> OKAY. >> I REALLY ‐‐ NO, I DON'T. I GUESS IT'S, UM ‐‐ I GREW UP AND I LEARNED CERTAIN THINGS AND I FELT BY DOING IT MYSELF THAT IT TAKES THE STING OUT OF IT WHEN YOU DO THAT. 200 YEARS OF THAT. YOU PICK A LITTLE COTTON AND YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT. FOR FREE. >> LORD KNOWS HE WAS COMPLICATED. RICHARD PRYOR CAME OUT OF A VERY DARK PLACE. AMERICA WAS COMING OUT OF A VERY DARK PLACE. AND THEN THE TWO CROSSED PATHS, RICHARD PRYOR MADE A JOKE, AND THEY WENT DOWN THE SAME ROAD TOGETHER. >> "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" IS A REVELATION FOR ALL THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO WERE HOME SMOKING POT ON A SATURDAY NIGHT. IT'S AS IF THE NETWORK HAS BEEN HIJACKED BY A BUNCH OF, LIKE, HIPSTERS AND STONERS. WHEN IT COMES TO COMEDY AND NETWORK TELEVISION, IT IS THE FINAL AND BIGGEST BREAK FROM THE OLD WORLD. >> THAT'S THE MOMENT WHEN LORNE MICHAEL SAYS, I NEED TO GET THE FUNNIEST PERSON ON THE PLANET TO BE THE GUEST HOST ON MY SHOW. >> LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, RICHARD PRYOR. >> HIS APPEARANCE ON "SNL" IN THE FIRST SEASON IS REFLECTIVE OF EXACTLY HIS KIND OF ABOVE GROUND/UNDERGROUND APPEAL. >> NOT ONLY DOES HE CONNECT SO INTENSELY AND DEEPLY WITH THE BLACK AUDIENCE, BUT ALSO HE BRINGS THE WHITE AUDIENCE WITH HIM AS WELL. >> SO PRYOR WAS ON ONE OF THE OPENING EPISODES OF THE FIRST SEASON, AND THERE IS A SKIT IN THAT EPISODE WHERE HE IS APPLYING FOR A JOB AND HE IS ACROSS A DESK FROM CHEVY CHASE. >> DOG? >> TREE. >> FAST? >> SLOW? >> AFTER SOME BACK AND FORTH CHEVY CHASE STARTS TO USE INCREASINGLY RACIST INSULTS AT PRYOR TO ASK HIM TO RESPOND. >> COLORED? >> REDNECK. >> JUNGLEBUNNY. >> PECKERWOOD. >> IT REALLY GOT VERY, VERY TENSE AND VERY REAL. >> HE IS UNRAVELING. AND THAT'S THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PERFORMANCE. HE'S GIVING VOICE TO THE ANGER, BUT HE'S SHOWING HOW ANGER UNMAKES YOU. >> I THINK EVEN CHEVY CHASE WAS STUNNED AT WHAT HAPPENED. >> I THINK RICHARD ACTUALLY SCARED CHEVY CHASE DURING THAT SCENE. >> JUNGLEBUNNY. >> HONKY! >> SPADE. >> HONKY HONKY! >> [ BLEEP ] >> DEAD HONKY. >> THEY WOULD HAVE CUT IT TODAY. BUT IN THOSE DAYS, GOD, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NOBODY HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE. >> THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE ON TV THAT USED THOSE WORDS. >> ANYBODY WHO WAS A TEENAGER BACK THEN COULD REPEAT THE ENTIRE ROUTINE TO YOU. WHICH IS A TESTAMENT TO THE POWER OF THE SHOW. >> HE WANTED TO GO AS FAR OUT AS HE COULD, AND HE WENT AS FAR OUT AS HE COULD. WHEN HE WENT ON THE SHOW, EVERYBODY WAS SAYING, YOU GOT TO WATCH THIS RICHARD PRYOR GUY. AND HE SAID, YOU KNOW, YOU THINK I'M INSANE? WATCH THIS. >> WELL, LOOK AT ME I'M STANDING HERE NAKED. >>> WHAT A BUSINESS. COMEDY IS BIGGER THAN EVER. THERE ARE NOW SOME 260 COMEDY CLUBS AROUND THE COUNTRY. YET THE COMEDY STORE REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. >> MICHAEL DUKAKIS! SOUNDS LIKE SOME KIND OF DAMN DISEASE, DOESN'T IT? >> IN THE '70s, COMEDY BECAME THE ROCK 'N' ROLL OF THAT ERA. >> IMPROV WAS BEGINNING TO BLOW UP. PLACES LIKE THE COMEDY STORE WERE BECOMING GO‐TO PLACES IN THE CULTURAL PANTHEON. >> YOU STAND IN THAT BACK HALLWAY THERE, AND THEN THE NEXT COMIC GOES ON, AND THEY ROAR. >> YOU GOT RICHARD PRYOR. >> IT WAS JIMMIE WALKER. >> YOU HAD STEVE MARTIN, ROBIN WILLIAMS. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN YOU GO LET ME. NO, THEY'RE FOR THE BABY. >> AND ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE JUST BLASTING OUT OF THE COMEDY STORE, AND THEY WERE GETTING, LIKE, SITCOMS. AND THEY WERE BECOMING BIG STARS OF THEIR TIME. IT FELT IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW, IT FELT LIKE THIS WAS THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE. >> AMERICA WAS CHANGING, BECOMING MORE DIVERSE, SO THE NETWORKS WANTED TO REACH OUT AND GRAB ON TO THIS NEW THING THAT WAS RICHARD PRYOR. BECAUSE HIS STAR WAS SO BIG AND GROWING. >> SO I ALWAYS HUNG OUT AT THE COMEDY STORE, AND I FOLLOWED HIM OUT THE PARKING LOT, AND HE TURNS AROUND AND SAYS, WHAT DO YOU WANT? I SAID, WILL YOU DO A TV SPECIAL? HE SAID, SELL IT. AND HE WALKED AWAY. THAT WAS IT. >> UP TO NOW WE'VE PAINTED A PICTURE OF PRYOR BEING VERY IN TUNE WITH THE CULTURE, RIGHT, AND PUSHING THE ENVELOPE JUST ENOUGH THAT NETWORKS ARE RESPONDING TO HIM. LIKE ANY ENTERTAINER, HE'S GOING TO GET AHEAD OF BECAUSE HE'S RUNNING FASTER THAN THE NETWORK IS READY TO RUN BEHIND HIM. >> NONE OF US WOULD BELIEVE AT THAT TIME THAT RICHARD PRYOR WAS EVER GOING TO BE ON TELEVISION. THAT LITTLE BOX COULDN'T HOLD RICHARD PRYOR. >> AND WHAT HAPPENS IS, LIKE, ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND BIZARRE EXPERIMENTS IN ALL OF TV HISTORY. >> "THE RICHARD PRYOR SHOW" WAS GOING TO BE A TV SERIES. IT WAS A VARIETY SHOW. >> IT WAS A STELLAR CAST OF COMEDIANS. YOU HAD SANDRA BERNHARD. YOU HAD ROBIN WILLIAMS. >> YOU GOT JOHN WITHERSPOON. YOU GOT ME. YOU GOT MARSHA WARFIELD. IT WAS COMEDY GLADIATOR SCHOOL. >> PRYOR REALLY INSISTED THAT THE WRITERS' ROOM WOULD BE DIVERSE, AND SO WHAT YOU SEE ON TV IS A REFLECTION OF THAT, NOT JUST IN THE CAST, BUT IN THE KINDS OF STORIES THAT THEY'RE DOING. >> YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. [ GUNSHOT ] >> THEY WANTED FULL AUTONOMY. NETWORKS DO NOT GIVE FULL AUTONOMY. DOES NOT HAPPEN. >> YOU BOUGHT A CONTROVERSIAL ENTERTAINER WITH A VOICE. I THINK NBC WOULD NATURALLY BE A LITTLE NERVOUS THEY WERE GOING TO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES IN PRIMETIME. >> THERE'S A REASON THEY'RE CALLED THE SUITS AND EVERYBODY WEARS A SUIT. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE. WE KNOW THAT'S WHY WE'RE ON. AND RICHARD SAID, "YOU DON'T KNOW ME, OKAY?" >> EVEN BEFORE THE SHOW CAME OUT, THERE WAS A MEDIA BUZZ ABOUT WHAT "THE RICHARD PRYOR SHOW" WAS GOING TO BE. WERE YOU GOING TO GET THE REAL UNCENSORED RICHARD PRYOR? >> THEY WERE AFRAID OF HIM. THEY REALLY WERE. I DIDN'T REALIZE AT THE TIME, BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE HIM. >> THAT BECAME A BIG PART OF THE DRAMA OF THE SHOW, WAS RICHARD'S WAR WITH THE NETWORK. >> THE MOST FAMOUS SKIT IN THAT SHOW NEVER EVEN AIRED. >> SO, HERE'S THE OPENING. >> GOOD EVENING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AND WELCOME TO "THE RICHARD PRYOR SHOW." >> THE SCENE WHEN HE WAS GOING TO OPEN THE SHOW WAS LIKE THROWING A HAND GRENADE INTO A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE. >> YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WRITTEN ABOUT ME. PEOPLE WONDERING IF I'M GONNA HAVE A SHOW. >> HE GOES, "IF YOU DO TELEVISION, YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING." >> WELL, LOOK AT ME. I'M STANDING HERE NAKED. I'VE GIVEN UP ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. >> HEAD TO TOE, NO GENITALIA. >> SO, ENJOY THE SHOW. >> YOU KNOW, IN THE '70s? I MEAN, THAT'S A SLAP THAT THEY JUST HAD A HARD TIME ACCEPTING. >> BUT WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS HAVE A POINT OF VIEW. AND ANYBODY'S POINT OF VIEW IS OBSCENE UNLESS SOMEBODY CAN CENSOR IT. YOU ASK ANY ONE OF THESE HUMAN BEINGS HERE. YOURSELF. YOU SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY. YOU CAN'T CENSOR PEOPLE'S STUFF, MAN. YOU CAN'T CENSOR THE TRUTH. >> DUE TO TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES, WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO BRING YOU THE AUDIO PORTION OF "THE RICHARD PRYOR SHOW." HOWEVER, I'M AN NBC SPOKESMAN, AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO TELL YOU WHAT MR. PRYOR IS SAYING. "I'M JUST PLEASED AS PUNCH TO BE CONTINUING ON AS PART OF THE NBC FAMILY." >> YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO COME AT YOU. >> ONE OF THE FIRST SKITS WE DID WAS RICHARD PRYOR BEING THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT. >> THEN, JUST HAVING HIM STAND THERE AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS ALREADY THE JOKE. >> MR. PRESIDENT, SINCE YOU'VE BECOME PRESIDENT, YOU'VE BEEN SEEN AND PHOTOGRAPHED ON THE ARMS OF WHITE WOMEN. >> OOH! WHOO! >> WILL THIS CONTINUE? >> MM. >> AS LONG AS I CAN KEEP IT UP. >> HEY, BOY, OVER HERE. YOU DON'T WANT ME. >> HE'S SO GOOD AT VOICES THAT HE CAN IMMEDIATELY MAKE WHATEVER THIS OBJECT IS FEEL LIKE A LIVING CHARACTER. >> TOUCH ME, I'LL BLOW ALL YOUR FINGERS OFF. >> THOSE GUNS TALKING TO HIM, WHEN WE DID IT, IT WAS 1977. INSANE. THAT WAS HIS IDEA. >> PEOPLE ENJOY KILLING EACH OTHER. >> YOU PUT THAT ON TV TODAY, NRA WOULD GO NUTS. I DON'T THINK YOU'D GET ON TV. >> WELL, GOOD NIGHT, AND SEE YOU NEXT WEEK. >> THE FREEDOM OF US BEING IN THAT SETTING AND GOING THERE WITH THESE KINDS OF THINGS, THAT PROBABLY WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN IN THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION. >> SO, THE SHOW LASTS FOR FOUR EPISODES. >> THE RATINGS WERE NOT GOOD. AND WE WERE AGAINST "LAVERNE AND SHIRLEY" AND "HAPPY DAYS." >> THOSE ARE THE SHOWS THAT NETWORK TV COULD MARRY. BUT THEY WANTED TO DATE RICHARD PRYOR. >> I DON'T KNOW HOW OR WHY IT ENDED, AND RICHARD TOLD ME, YOU EN WHY, [ BLEEP ] I WALKED. >> YES, I'M VERY ANGRY. I'M ANGRY BECAUSE I HAVE TO ASK PEOPLE, MAY I DO THIS? MAY I DO THIS KIND OF SCRIPT? MAY I SAY THIS KIND OF JOKE? >> BUT DON'T WE ALL, TO A DEGREE IN LIFE, HAVE TO DO THAT? >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO, AND THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM. I'M TALKING ABOUT WHAT MAKES ME ANGRY IS THE FACT THAT, ACROSS THE BOARD, IN MY MIND, THERE'S NOBODY I'VE EVER MET IN THE BUSINESS OF, LIKE, COMEDY WHO IS ANY MORE BRILLIANT THAN ME. AND I WILL NEVER GET THE RECOGNITION FOR WHAT I DO. >> HE WAS TORN, TORN ABOUT STUFF, I GUESS. TORN IN SOME WAY. HE WANTED TO BE EMBRACED BY HIS CULTURE. HE WAS A HUGE TALENT THAT COULD JUST GO ANYWHERE, AND YET THAT CULTURE WAS THE ANTITHESIS OF WHO HE WAS IN HIS MOST VULNERABLE SELF. >> RICHARD CARRIED AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF TAMPED DOWN PERSONAL RAGE. >> HE FREEBASED EVERY DAY. >>> HOLLYWOOD IS NUMBER ONE. THAT'S WHERE PRYOR WANTS TO GO AND WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO PUT PRYOR. >> THE APEX OF SHOW BUSINESS IS BEING A MOVIE STAR, WHICH IS ON THE OTHER END OF SHOW BUSINESS WHERE HE'S A COMEDIAN. YOU KNOW, MOVIE STAR, COMEDIAN. >> HIS GREATEST FAME PEAKS IN THE 1970s. HE BECOMES HUGE. >> BEING SUCCESSFUL AS A BLACK PERSON IN THE EARLY '70s IN HOLLYWOOD, THERE WERE VERY FEW. >> YOU HAD SIDNEY POITIER AND YOU HAD, UM ‐‐ SIDNEY POITIER. >> THE STUDIOS ARE CRUMBLING AND THE ENTERTAINMENT HIERARCHY IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. >> I STARTED AT UNIVERSAL. I'D JUST TURNED 23. THEY WERE MAKING SIX MOVIES A YEAR AND YOU WOULDN'T GO SEE ANY OF THEM. THEY HAD MOVIE STARS THAT I THOUGHT WERE DEAD. >> I THINK THEY WERE BEGINNING TO SEE THAT THERE WAS A YOUNG AUDIENCE OUT THERE, AND THEY WANTED THAT YOUNG AUDIENCE. COMEDY IS A STAPLE AND RICHARD WAS THE FUNNEST GUY AT THAT TIME. >> I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU BABY, I'M‐A MAKE LOVE TO YOU TONIGHT, BABY. YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT. >> HE WAS DEEP INTO THE MAINSTREAM. HE WAS KNOWN TO EVERYBODY. >> HE WANTED TO BE A STAR. HE WANTED TO BE BIG. >> HE THOUGHT THAT "LADY SINGS THE BLUES" WOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF A NEW RICHARD. >> THIS IS A FRIEND OF MINE. YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT. >> HE'S ASKED TO PLAY PIANO MAN. IT'S NOT EVEN A ROLE WITH A NAME. >> HE WAS HIRED FOR ONLY $500 FOR THE FIRST DAY. AND THAT WAS IT. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A ONE‐OFF. AND EVERY DAY THEY HIRED HIM BACK AND THEY REWROTE STUFF. >> IT WAS A TINY LITTLE ROLE AND HE EXPANDED IT TO WHAT IT WAS. >> RICHARD LOVED HIS ROLE AS THE PIANO MAN, BUT WHEN IT WASN'T RECEIVED WELL, THAT BOTHERED RICHARD A LOT. >> WHAT I WANT TO DO IS, UH, DO A MOVIE THAT'S SO TERRIFIC THAT I WIN 13 ACADEMY AWARDS FOR IT. >> AND WHAT WOULD THAT SAY TO YOU, IF YOU WON ALL THOSE ACADEMY AWARDS? RICHARD PRYOR'S GOOD? >> THAT NOT ONLY DID I WIN IN MY SPACE, BUT I WON IN YOUR SPACE. >> YOU MEAN, WHITE PERSON'S SPACE? >> YEAH. I WAS EXCELLENT ENOUGH THAT YOU HAD TO ACCEPT ME. I'M HERE TONIGHT TO EXPLAIN WHY NO BLACK PEOPLE WILL EVER BE NOMINATED FOR ANYTHING. >> RICHARD PRYOR, FOR BETTER OR WORSE, WAS A MOVIE STAR. >> RICHARD WAS ALWAYS MY ACE CARD. IF RICHARD WOULD DO IT, IT WAS AUTOMATICALLY HIP, DESIRABLE, COOL. >> IF RICHARD PRYOR WAS IN A MOVIE, IT WAS A HIT. >> WE DID "CAR WASH." >> BECAUSE MONEY WALKS AND [ BLEEP ] TALKS. >> "WHICH WAY IS UP." THAT MOVIE WAS DROP DEAD, FALL ON THE FLOOR, DIE LAUGHING. >> RICHARD DID ALL THREE CHARACTERS. >> YOU KNOW THAT CHICKEN I PUT IN THE REFRIGERATOR LAST NIGHT? WELL, I EXPECT TO FIND IT WHEN I GET HOME. >> HE'S IN THE WIZ. HE'S IN SILVER STREAK, WHICH IS HIS BUDDY MOVIE WITH GENE WILDER. >> THE COMBINATION OF THEM BUMBLING AROUND AND RIFFING OFF EACH OTHER WAS REALLY, REALLY FUNNY. >> HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET ON THE TRAIN? >> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. >> I STILL GOT THE GUN. MAYBE I COULD START A DIVERSION. >> YEAH, BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT. >> WHEN HE STARTED TO DO MOVIES AND MAKE THESE BIG PAYCHECKS, I THINK HE DID FEEL AS IF HE WERE COMPROMISING. >> THEY'RE PAYING ME $2 MILLION TO DO THIS MOVIE. DO YOU BELIEVE IT? MY GRANDMOTHER DIDN'T MAKE THAT ALL HER LIFE, AND SHE'S A BETTER WOMAN THAN YOU ARE A MAN. >> YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THIS. >> YEAH, SURE, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME ‐‐ >> "STIR CRAZY." >> IT SUCKS. >> HE WANTED MANY THINGS. LIKE ALL OF US, HE WANTED TO BE LOVED. HE ALSO WANTED TO BE FAMOUS. SO WAS IT A COMPROMISE? OKAY. BUT THE CHECKS CLEARED, AND AS BEST I CAN TELL, HE CASHED EVERY ONE OF THEM. >> I THINK HE WANTS TO DO HIS TYPE OF FILM, BUT THE PROBLEM IS WE NEVER KNEW WHAT HIS TYPE OF FILM WAS. >> SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A PERSON RICHARD PRYOR, AND HE DOES ALL THIS COMEDY AND STUFF, AND THEN THERE'S ME, AND I WONDER WHAT I HAVE TO DO WITH RICHARD. I FEEL LIKE I LIVE HIS HOUSE, AND I DRY HIS CAR AND SPEND HIS MONEY, BUT IT AIN'T ME, YOU KNOW? IT'S NOT ME. >> HE STARTED FEELING GUILTY ABOUT HIS BIG SUCCESS. IT MADE HIM FEEL LIKE HE WAS BEING ACCEPTED BY WHITE SOCIETY, WHICH CONFUSED HIM, IRRITATED HIM, ANGERED HIM. >> I DON'T THINK IT'S EASY TO BE A CELEBRITY. THAT KIND OF FAME, IT'S HUGE. IT'S A BURDEN. AND I THINK AT SOME POINT HE LOST HIS WAY. AND THEN HIS DRUG DEALER INTRODUCED HIM TO FREEBASE, WHICH WAS THE PIPE. >> FREEBASING WAS A WAY TO CONCENTRATE COKE. >> OH, MY GOD. THAT'S WHEN BASICALLY ALL HELL BREAK LOOSE. >> YOU HIT THAT PIPE, YOU GO, OH, MANY I GOD. WHOA. THIS IS ‐‐ OH. WHOO. WONDERFUL. LET ME HAVE ANOTHER HIT OF THAT. >> THE PIPE HAD AHOLD OF HIM. COULDN'T LET GO. >> THIS PIPE IS TO TELL ME WHEN TO GO TO BED. THE PIPE WOULD SAY, TIME TO GET UP. TIME FOR SOME SMOKE, RICH. COME ON, NOW. WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TODAY. [ BLEEP ] ALL YOUR APPOINTMENTS. ME AND YOU WE'RE JUST GONNA HANG OUT IN THIS ROOM TOGETHER. >> HE STARTS MISSING SHOWS MISSING DATES, MISSING WORK. >> THEY BOUGHT HIM DRUGS TO GET HIM IN FILMS, THEY BOUGHT DRUGS TO KEEP HIM ON A FILM. I'M TALKING TWO POUNDS OF STUFF. >> I DON'T KNOW NOTHING. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? I DON'T KNOW. [ BLEEP ]. I'M LUCKY. >> HE DISAPPEARED. RICHARD WASN'T HOME ANYMORE. HE TALKED ABOUT HAVING OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCES, SEEING ALIENS LOOKING IN THE WINDOW. >> THAT WAS THE DRUG. HAD AHOLD OF HIM. >> WE COULD HAVE HAD IT ALL, LIKE THAT SONG SAYS. AND BECAUSE OF THE DRUGS, WE DIDN'T. WE LOST IT. WE LOST IT. >> COMEDIAN RICHARD PRYOR IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION TONIGHT AND GIVEN LESS THAN A 50% CHANCE OF SURVIVING AFTER SUFFERING THIRDS OWN OVER HALF OF HIS BODY. >>> ONE NIGHT, WE'RE HEADING OVER THE CANYON TO GO HOME, AND HE DOES A U‐TURN. A FEW MINUTES LATER, WE PULL INTO THE COMEDY STORE PARKING LOT. >> THIS WAS THE PLACE THAT HE CAME WHEN HE WANTED TO DO HIS STUFF FROM SCRATCH. EVERY TIME HE CAME IN, IT WAS LIKE JESUS CHRIST WAS SHOWING UP. >> HE SITS ME DOWN AT A TABLE, AND HE WALKS ON STAGE. AND I JUST INSTINCTIVELY STARTED TAKING NOTES. AND AT THE END OF A COUPLE OF MONTHS, HE HAD LIVE IN CONCERT. >> THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS A FILMED COMEDY SPECIAL BEFORE "LIVE IN CONCERT." >> THERE ARE POINTS IN RICHARD PRYOR'S CAREER YOU CAN POINT AND SAY, THAT WAS BIG. "LIVE IN CONCERT", RICHARD PRYOR, WAS HUGE. >> IT SHAPES EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT STANDUP IS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DECADES, BECAUSE EVERY STANDUP COMEDIAN LEARNS FROM THAT PERFORMANCE. >> IT IS RICHARD PRYOR IN FULL FLOWER, IN FULL POWER. >> WHAT YOU TAKING MY PICTURE FOR? WHO YOU GON SHOW IT TO I GOT A PICTURE OF RICHARD PRYOR! WHO GIVES A [ BLEEP ]? >> IT'S A MOMENT WHEN HE HAS A KIND OF A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO CHARACTER, IN WHICH THE MAIN CHARACTER IS HIMSELF. >> ANYONE HERE EVER HAVE A HEART ATTACK? THEM [ BLEEP ] HURT I'M NOT [ BLEEP ] MAN. I WAS WALKING IN THE FRONT YARD.

IT WAS GOOD. >> ONE ROUTINE RICHARD DID, WHICH REALLY EMBODIES SO MUCH, IS THE WHITE MAN'S VOICE. >> HE ALWAYS HAD A WHITE GUY VOICE. IT JUST MADE ME LAUGH. >> WEREN'T WE SITTING HERE? WE WERE SITTING HERE, WEREN'T WE? YES, WE WERE SITTING HERE. >> WHITE PEOPLE WENT CRAZY FOR "LIVE IN CONCERT." >> IN A WORLD THAT WAS STILL SOMEWHAT SEGREGATED, HE WAS THIS FANTASTIC BRIDGE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN THESE TWO COMMUNITIES. >>U NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING FUNNY, ARE YOU? >> RICHARD HELD UP A MIRROR TO THEM "THIS IS WHO YOU ARE. LAUGH AT YOURSELVES, YOU CAN LAUGH, BUT KNOW YOURSELF." >> LIVE IN CONCERT DID MUCH BETTER THAN ANYBODY THOUGHT. IT MADE A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY. >> BY THE END OF THE 1970s, RICHARD PRYOR IS ON THE TOP OF THE ENTERTAINMENT WORLD. BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM LURKING IN THE BACKGROUND. HE KNOWS ABOUT IT, THE PUBLIC DOESN'T. >> PRYOR IS IN THE THROES OF THIS ADDICTION TO COKE AND TO FREEBASE. AND HE ENDS UP BURNING HIMSELF TERRIBLY WHILE FREEBASING, AND IT BECOMES A HUGE, HUGE STORY. >> I SAW RICHARD JUST ONLY A FEW HOURS BEFORE HE BURNT UP.
