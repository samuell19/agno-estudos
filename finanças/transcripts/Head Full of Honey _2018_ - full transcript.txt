MATILDA: My doctor, Dr. Edwards, told me everything I know about Grandpa's illness. Grandpa has Alzheimer's. People with Alzheimer's forget a lot of stuff. I mean, I forget to do my homework, or brush my teeth, but with my grandpa, it's different. He forgets pretty much everything. My parents want to put him in a home, but that's just gonna make things worse. So, I'm taking him on a trip to Venice to make him better. He remembers loads about Venice, even though it's been like 100 years since he and Grandma went on their honeymoon there. MATILDA: Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Me and Grandpa are having a great time. And I brought my inhaler, so don't freak out. We're having breakfast on the train, actually, right now. (BOTH LAUGHING) Grandpa, do you wanna say something? -Who to? -Mom and Dad. Hello? We're having a great time. No one's there. Poop on them. Yeah. Poop on them. See you tomorrow. Or maybe the day after. -Love you. -Bye! Bye! Where are you going? To the john. Okay. (CLICKS TONGUE) (SMACKS LIPS) (EXHALES SHARPLY) (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) (INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENTS OVER PA) Oh, shit! Grandpa! (CELL PHONE RINGING) (BRAKES SQUEALING) (SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) Grandpa! MATILDA: That's us. My Grandpa Amadeus and me. I think I get why Grandpa is the way he is. Mom and Dad spend their whole life thinking about what might happen at work, to the new house, to me, or going over and over the past. But sometimes it's just best to focus on what's going on right now. It all started when Grandma died. PRIEST: Margaret was certainly one of the most glamorous women in our little community. Do you think they're going to burn her? Who? Your grandma, silly. Are you mad? No way. Okay, then she'll just get eaten up by worms. My grandma's in a coffin. They can chew through coffins. Sharp little worm teeth. Yeah. Can we change the subject? What's England like? Did you make new friends? Not really. Did you meet the queen? Yes, I did. -She said to say hi. -(CHUCKLING) Margaret's passing leaves us all with a huge hole in our hearts. But as long as a person lives in our memories, she's never forgotten. She is never forgotten. Amadeus will now say a few words. AMADEUS: Thank you. My Maggie was just wonderful. She had the biggest heart and breasts. Big, beautiful breasts. (GIGGLES) She always laughed at my stupid joy, jokes. Right up to the end. What bees make milk? Boobies. (EXHALES) And I always ate that apple pie of hers. You know, the one with the cinnamon crust and the squirty cream. She hadn't made that in years. I know that. Actually, I was never crazy about that pie. But I always ate it when she made it. Because people are just creatures. Creatures of habit. I would've loved something different. Fruit cake, perhaps? No, no, no. I don't like fruit cake. Pecan pie, maybe? Or, what are they called... You know, uh... Cream puffs. They make the best cream puffs down at... The intersection there... Where the... It's a new house... (STAMMERS) They thingamajigged the house... They squeezed it in... I don't... They... Oh, stuff it up your ass. Stuff it up your ass. But I'd love a slice of that pie now. My darling Elizabeth. Elizabeth? It's his mother. Nick, one day I hope you'll find a woman that's as wonderful as your mother was for me. What am I gonna do without you? (CLICKS TONGUE) Arrivederci, my love. Arrivederci. Arrivederci. (SIGHS) (MOUTHING) Grandma. MATILDA: After the funeral, Dad asked Grandpa if he wanted to come and live with us in England. But Grandpa didn't want to. He said he couldn't leave Grandma all alone. So, we went back to England without Grandpa. But three months later, Grandpa called and told Dad that he couldn't remember the way to the cemetery anymore. Tildy! My little principessa! (LAUGHING) I'll take that. I've seen this guy before. Come on in. Here. Have a seat right here. Okay. Okay. -Would you like a cookie? -Sure. Did you take the bus? No, Grandpa, we live in England now, remember? Oh, I know that! I know that. -MATILDA: Um, Grandpa... -Mmm-hmm? Why do you have milk in your bookshelves? No more room in the dishwasher. (CHUCKLING) Margaret! Maggie! Your son is here! Dad. Mom's... Mom's not here. I know that. Of course. It's habit. You looking for something? Where's Roberta? -Roberta? -Your housekeeper. I fired her. You fired her? Why'd you do that? She was stealing from me. What did she take? Your sister's jewelry. Dad, I don't have a sister. But you always wanted one, didn't you? (CHUCKLES) Is this the jewelry you're talking about? It's all there. Huh. I'm glad she brought it all back. Coffee? Grandpa, aren't you supposed to keep those locked up somewhere? Honey, if the Russians came you wouldn't wanna have your gun locked up. That's not a real gun. Watch this. (EXHALES) NICK: You got any milk? Okay. Black, then. -MATILDA: Whoa! -(GUNSHOTS CONTINUE) (CHUCKLING) Oh, boy. -(LAUGHING) -Dad! -Have you completely lost your mind? -(LAUGHING) Give it! Have you completely lost your mind? Where did you get this? Not at Trader Joe's, that's for sure. Honey, are you okay? -MATILDA: Yeah. -Oh, brother. I got an idea. Why don't you come back and live with us for a while? Yay! Only if you've got something you want me to do. There'll be plenty for you to do. Right, sweetie? We can get Grandpa to help out with the garden. We just want you back home. But I need... I need to take some of my... -This stuff. -Yeah. This. Dad, you can bring whatever you want. I'll arrange a shipping container or something. Just... No guns, okay? No guns. AMADEUS: And Cindy's okay with this? Who? -Your mom. -NICK: Oh, Sarah. Mom will be okay with it. I promise. You've got your own en-suite bathroom, Amadeus, and I left some fresh towels for you on the bed. And you can walk to school with me. I'm right across the hall. -Where's Jack? -Jack? Who's Jack? My dog. Is he tied up outside? He doesn't like to be tied up. Jack died, Amadeus. Last Christmas, wasn't it? Here. You can have Benny instead. He's really soft. And he doesn't smell half as bad as Jack did. NICK: Honey, this is ridiculous. I have to go. I have a meeting. -I can't miss this. -No, I'm late. I've got a pitch this afternoon. I'm cutting it really close as it is. I cannot miss this meeting. You promised me you were going to move to England for my career, right? -That was the deal. -Mmm-hmm. I moved to America for yours, now it's my turn. -I can't be late. -For once. I have made every school visit since Tilda was four years old, so... That's not true. Yes, it is! Please don't do this to me. Please, do not do this to me. Hi! Sorry about that. Here we are. -Here we go. -No worries. Thank you. Great. If you just turn to page four... -Four. -NICK: Okay. Obviously, Matilda did have some issues settling in. 'Cause it was a very big move for you, wasn't it, Matilda? I was wondering if you felt like things were improving. 'Cause I know that you miss your family in America very much. Well, she has been settling in, right? Yes, definitely. She's already started saying things like "bath" instead of "bath." Thank God. -No, I don't. -SARAH: Yes, you do. Or you could if you wanted to. Well, as you can see, her marks have improved a little bit. I'm sorry, but I've gotta go. Tilda, darling, I'll see you later. I'll take that. Do you want me to take this, or do you... I was wondering how you were feeling about things, Matilda. Fine, thanks. That's wonderful. So, is there anything else? I wanted to go over some of our extracurricular activities that we offer, because I really feel that they could help Matilda cement some of these new friendships. Could you e-mail me the details? I'm so sorry. I'm late for a pitch, which is pretty important, but... I love you, darling. Well done. I'll see you later. Thank you so much, Missus, um, Miss... -Seager. -Seager! Yes, of course! I know that. We're so thrilled everything is going brilliantly and so proud of you, darling. Okay? Bye. Thank you. Bye. MATILDA: My parents work a lot. Dad works for a bank. He got a new job in London after he spent too much time with Penny, his office manager in Connecticut. We went back here because Mom grew up here and wanted to be close to her mom. Then, Dad found out that Mom made out with her new boss at the Christmas party because she was still mad at him about Penny. Dad got really upset. But Grandpa just said, "If the roosters can do it to the hens "then the hens can do it to the roosters." I guess Dad didn't really agree, because now he works all the time. (TELEPHONE RINGING) -Yeah. -Nick. The police just called. What do you mean, the police just called? Your father's with them now. -Where? -They're down at the station. Well, what's he doing there? -Is he hurt? -No, no. He's not hurt, he's fine. -What is it? -You might want to sit down. I'm sitting down. Stop rambling and tell me what it is. -What is it? -I'm not rambling on. I'm just trying to tell you what your dad has done, Nick. -And I'm waiting. -He's filed a missing persons report... ...for your mother. That's fine. -I'm sorry. -You're good. I'll just clean it up real quick. Hello. Hi. I'm Mrs. Ross. I've come to pick up my father-in-law. The elderly gentleman who reported his wife is missing. -Yes. -Yeah. He gave us this. Do you know who she is? Yes, that's my late mother-in-law, when she was young. This was supposed to be her missing persons photo. Sorry to have taken up your time. Can I take him home now? Thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks. AMADEUS: Very nice of you to say that. SARAH: Here you are, Amadeus. That's Maggie. Isn't she beautiful? All the boys were chasing her. They all wanted to be with her, but she chose, well, she wanted, you know... You wanted to show your photo to the policemen? Why on earth would I do that? SARAH: I don't know. You tell me. Maybe I wanted to boast a bit. (ALL CHUCKLING) -Well, you ready to go home now? -Oh, no. I don't want to. I want to stay here with this officer. She's been really kind. -She's got a kind face. -Thank you. -Yes, she does, but I'm sure she's very busy. -(MOUTHING) Thank you. So, let's get you home. Come on. Up you go. Come on. Thank you so much. Bye. One, two, three, four, five. -And three next time-- -Wait a minute. Hold on. Hold on a second. -What? -That's five? Stop moving my pieces. -I think that was-- -No! Come on, can you count? One, two, three, four, five, thank you! Okay, just checking. I know you like to win. Well, I know you hate to lose, which in this case, you're going to, 'cause all I need is a three next time and I have won. Again! Here you are. It's your turn. (SARAH CLEARS THROAT) Amadeus, hello? Let him take his time. I'm just trying to figure out my next move. We're not playing chess. -Just let him figure out his next move, Mom. -Okay, fine. Sorry. Carry on. If I go left, they'll cut me off here. MATILDA: That wouldn't be a good move at all, but you have a clear run if you go this way. You think? Look, you can't go this way, you said it yourself. And you'd be in danger of getting ambushed if you went this way. If you take this route, you'll be fine. Thanks! Seven, eleven. Oh, dear! Look what you've done. Oh, no! Where did it go? -Wait, where was it? -This was-- I know, but it's important, because if we don't... -So can you put them back where... -A six! A six! -Really? -Yeah, a six. -It looks like a six to me. -AMADEUS: Six. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine... -Ten. -NICK: You see that? -We got a winner! -MATILDA: Amadeus! SARAH: No. You... You rolled a six. -Honey. Honey. -MATILDA: Mom! Not a 10. -Mom! -What? I'm sorry, but we can't... There's no point playing unless we play by the rules. Really! Why does it upset you when someone else wins? Because it's pointless! Who's in favor of us playing by Grandpa's rules? -(HORN HONKS) -NICK: All right. Ooh! At last! What is that? Dad's belongings. I wanted him to feel at home here. Well, thanks for telling me. You're welcome. Wait, he... That doesn't look very good, Nick. You should stop him because... -It looks like he's about to-- -Yeah. Excuse me... God! (SPEAKING IN ARABIC) You absolute plonker. What do you think a rearview mirror was invented for? Great! Thank you. Not even a scratch! The truck is fine! Thank you so much! A very professional moving company, thank you! Don't worry, Cinder-ah, I'll tip 'em! Cheers, mate. Watch your step. Try not to break everything this time. Yes, boss. I'm just saying. Thanks, mate. How has this happened? I feel like I'm on Candid Camera or something, Nick. That's it, good work. What is that? A fridge? This here? That's a bookcase. SARAH: A bookcase? What? NICK: It's for his books. How much did you have to pay to get his dirty old fridge shipped across the Atlantic? I don't know. I had the office take care of it. How did this happen? I'm not running some sort of storage facility, Nick! -This is so depressing! -Honey, honey... It's his stuff. It's important to him and it makes him happy. SARAH: Well, that's all that matters, I guess. What the... Bloody idiots! What did I just say at the bottom of the stairs? And you were like, (MIMICS) "Yes, boss." You two morons are gonna pay for this! So, does anyone know where the fridge goes? Yeah, yeah. The fridge goes in the bathroom. Stop! Stop! Amadeus! I don't mean to be rude, Amadeus. I'm so sorry, but I'm afraid it's just too much stuff! I know it's your things-- No! But listen, either it's got to go all in the barn over there or else it's got to go in your bedroom. Do you understand me? And I mean all of it. Amadeus, okay? Okay, guys, let's get out of here! (KNOCK ON DOOR) Sir, may I come in? Hey, big guy. (CHUCKLES) Good one. We, uh... We found this in the back of the truck. Now it's back! She is gonna be so glad you found this. Here, let me give you... -Let me give you some... -No, no, no. Sir, please. You've already given us plenty. -Are you sure? -Yeah, yeah, of course. You take care of yourself, okay? Yeah. (AMADEUS CLICKING TONGUE) You're a real doll. (SMACKS LIPS) Amadeus, could you pass the bread, please? Amadeus? The bread? What about it? Could you pass it, please? -Thank you, but I was asking your dad. -Here you go. (CLICKING TONGUE) Amadeus, please stop doing that. It's really annoying when we're trying to eat. -Honey, honey... -Mom! Can we just try and have an enjoyable evening? -Well, are you going to ask him to stop, then? -Dad? No one's allowed to do anything here. I should've stayed home. This is your home. It was more fun there... Dad, this is your-- Dad. Don't throw your food, please. All right, fine, carry on. Please, carry on clicking your tongue and throwing food around the place. Fine. I've had enough anyway. No, I don't feel like it anymore. What a shame. Yeah, it's your own fault. Bored, huh? Tell me again how you met Grandma. Yes, please, do tell us again. Why don't you tell us the story on how you met your boss? How did you two meet? NICK: I guess I told him. I was angry. I don't remember. That's convenient. Must run in the family, not being able to remember things. -What? -Nothing. I know you don't wanna hear this but I think there's something up with him. He just needs time to get over the shock. Don't you think it'd be a good idea just to take him to a doctor and get him checked out? Make sure he doesn't have some kind of early onset dementia or something? No, he's fine. He's fine, you're fine, I'm fine, our marriage is fine, everybody's fine, we're all fine! -Everything's fine! -Are we gonna do this all night? I gotta get some shut-eye. Okay. I don't get it. That math teacher is no good at explaining anything. Maybe he's a retard. You can't say "retard" here, Grandpa. Well, then, maybe he's an asshat. What's an "asshat"? You know, someone who has a hat on their ass. How do you take your coffee? Grandpa, I'm only 10. Coffee's good for your brain. Well, okay, then. Coffee's good. Damn machines. Why do they have to make everything so complicated? You have to put water in it. Oh. Okay. -Darn thing! -Do you want me to help? Wait... Yeah, it's gotta brew for a minute. Can you help me with my math? Can't your friends help you? You had to do calculations when you were a veterinarian, right? Sure. Yeah, sure. We didn't do this in school. We always just let our fractions stay whatever size they like. Then, should I do that? Sure. Sure, why not? They look pretty good the way they are. Okay, thanks. SARAH: Anyone seen the honey? Amadeus, have you had any honey? I'm allergic to honey. -(CHUCKLES) -Oh! You're a pretty lady. -Hello? -How about the two of us going for coffee somewhere, huh? Just the two of us. SARAH: Oh, no, I'm so sorry. Oh, how awful. Go! Get off! Get lost! -Absolutely fine. -Get lost! Get! -(LAUGHING) -Fine, no problem. I hope you feel better. Okay, bye. -Damn it! -MATILDA: What's wrong? The gardener, he's still ill. He's been off for weeks. -Well, Grandpa could help. -I could help. I need something to do. Well, do you think you could manage it? You really feel confident you could do it? Mom, he's not a baby. All right, well, just deadhead the roses, and then, tidy up the borders a bit. Do you know what? The hedge could do with a bit of a trim, just a couple of inches or something. You don't have to tell me, Sandra. It's Sarah, Amadeus. That's a good name, too. Who made that? I did. Whoo! You're a pretty lady. I'll see you later. ♪ These bones, they are aching ♪ They're getting weaker every day (MOTOR SPUTTERING) ♪ Like I won't hear (MOTOR REVVING) ♪ Like those doctors say ♪ And they're aching bad ♪ Every single day ♪ Like I won't hear ♪ Like they always say ♪ So take me back to Hollywood town ♪ Where it's warm, now ♪ Where it's warm ♪ The folks round here say, "Boy, you never had it so good" ♪ You don't know you're born ♪ You're born ♪ And I know you don't like what I'm doing ♪ But baby, you don't understand ♪ SARAH: What are you doing? AMADEUS: I'm trimming the, uh... -What? -The thingamajiggy. I said that much! It's that much. Spot on. If you ask me, I thought it was much nicer before. No, no. -If you want me to leave this section, or... -Stop! Do you want me to cut it down, Sandra? -Oh, my God! -It's your decision. Oh, God! NICK: Well, you've always wanted an English garden, right? What's that got to do with an English garden? Why has an English garden got a big hole in the middle of the hedge? That's not an English garden. That's just a wrecked garden. To tell you the truth, I kinda like the look of it. I think that it makes the place look bigger. It's kinda nice. Do you know how many fucking years it takes to grow a hedge that high? Mom! You cannot say the F-word! -Sorry, sweetheart, I can't help it. -No cursing, honey. Nick, what are you gonna do about this? What's he gonna wreck next, you know? Buy a new hedge. -Hi, Dad. -Buy a new hedge? Sorry, where'd you get those? From your garden. Do you like 'em? (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) Are you deliberately trying to drive me mad? -No. -No? No, no, no. I'm trying to apologize to you, Sandra. -Sarah. -I didn't shear-- Sarah. I didn't cut myself properly... No, the... -Hedge. -Hedge! Stop! Stop, Amadeus! Do you understand, maybe, possibly why I might just be a bit upset? You know what? We're gonna have a party here, right? And all these people are gonna come, and instead of a beautiful hedge they're gonna see nothing! Just a big gap now! -Mom! -And then, when they come into the garden... -Mom! -...there aren't gonna be any flowers anymore because you cut them all! -May I please-- -Do you what? Dad, we really are so appreciative that you want to help out around the house. However, I think what Sarah's trying to say, and I think we're all in agreement on this, is that if you have some questions about gardening, it might be a good idea to check with Sarah first before you... -It was Mom's idea! -Right? I think... Okay, how about this? I've got a better idea, Dad. How about, just no gardening. None. Elizabeth always loved roses. Mom's name was Margaret. (TELEPHONE RINGING) VIVIAN: Hello, darling. SARAH: Hi, Mum. You sound odd. I'm just finding it quite difficult with Amadeus. Lovely Amadeus? What do you mean? He's just being really weird and forgetful, and I'm sure that he's got some-- You just have to be patient. You have to learn to look at it with... Humor. Humor and wisdom. And that is the key. Darling, it can teach you a lot about yourself, and it's called love. Speaking of love, how's Nick? Keeps his eyes shut as normal. Doesn't wanna see what's in front of him, -you know? -Well, you know you have that problem sometimes. I mean, don't we all? Okay, Mum. Well, listen, I'm really busy. I've got to go, okay? I'll call you later. Darling, don't forget, wisdom and humor. -Okay, bye. Love you. Bye. -Bye. MATILDA: Every morning, Grandpa would take me to school and back. Sometimes, he was himself, and sometimes not. Like, he started taking things and leaving them in the wrong places. (SNIFFING) Once, he took a cooked chicken out of the fridge and put it in his closet and Mom didn't find it for a week. (GAGGING) He would get up in the middle of the night and walk around the house. AMADEUS: Maggie? Are you there? Ah! (CHUCKLES) You-- Oh, no, it rains all the time here. -It's... In fact, I think it's... -Dad. Dad. (MUMBLING) MATILDA: Dad says old people get confused and he'll settle down. Mom doesn't talk about it anymore. She just spends more and more time at work. I'm hungry. (SIGHS) Tell me a story, Grandpa. A story? About you and Dad when he was my age. I once took your dad camping with some friends in the 40-acre field behind the house. Grandpa told us it was crawling with bears at night, just to scare us. I did. I did. (BOTH LAUGHING) He said we had to arm ourselves with all the tools in the shed just to defend ourselves against the bears, right? Just to be able to make it back and forth from the barn without getting eaten. We had everything in that tent. We had pitchforks, axes, we had handsaws, you name it. You took your fishing rod. You remember that? How could I forget? As if you could chase off a bear with a fishing rod. And then Grandpa goes out to take a leak, right, and we hear this strange, loud roar like... (HOWLING) Grandpa comes runnin' back in, and he says, "It was a bear." And I say, "Bears don't howl." And he said, "Around here, they do, son." You know, I still don't think there's any such thing as a howling bear. That was me. (NICK SNAPS FINGERS) -You never told me that before. -You never asked me. (MOUTHING) Come here. (AMADEUS CHUCKLING) Dad, listen, I, uh... I spoke to a doctor. He thought it might be a good idea if you came in to see him. Why? Well... Because I'm an idiot? That is all? -No. -I'm an idiot. -Absolutely not. -Is that what... Of course not. -You think I'm... -No, Dad. Come on. You think I'm losing it. Well, well... I'm not gonna go see a damn doctor. -Wait. -He might be able to help. Keep an open mind. -No! -All right, well, he might be able to help. -No! -Okay. Now you sound like your mother. Did she want you to go to the doctor, too? I can't remember anymore. (VOICE BREAKING) I don't remember anything. But he, I know, he definitely... He can't help me. I know that definitely, for sure. -(MOUTHING) Okay. -Well... SARAH: Did you talk to him? He's not going. (SIGHS) Great. So what are you gonna do now? Nothing. What do you want me to do? Force him? How do you do that? How do you force an old man to go to the doctor -when he doesn't want to go to the doctor? -I don't know. How did you force me to take in all of his old junk? You just do it without telling him. He's got Alzheimer's or something, Nick. I'm exhausted. I can't carry on like this anymore. Neither of us have slept for weeks. It's just too much. We can't manage on our own anymore, Nick. We need help. Tomorrow, I have to go to Berlin. Wait, what, Berlin? But that's not in the calendar. James, he called me at the end of the day yesterday. We've got to close this, the Pfeiffer deal. Okay, but there's a problem, because I've got my pitch, and you were meant to be taking Tilda to the doctor. And Therese isn't here, so how are we gonna make that work? That's taken care of. -Really? -Dad's got it. -Are you joking? -It was Tilda's idea. She even made him a neck pouch. What do you mean, "a pouch"? What, like, Paddington Bear pouch? Like, with his name and address on it. Well, that's really helpful. (STAMMERING) I don't know who that is. Paddington Bear? You don't know who Paddington Bear is? No. Must be an English thing. If you're gonna be sarcastic, it's not gonna help. He takes her to school every day. Matilda knows where the doctor's office is. He's trying to be useful. Let him. (CELL PHONE RINGING) MATILDA: Hey, Dad. Where are you? -I'm in Berlin, remember? -Cool. Did Grandpa pick you up? Of course, we're there now. Okay. Can I talk to him? Grandpa's busy filling out forms right now. -He's filling out forms? -Yeah. Let me talk to him. -Yeah. And they're calling us in! -Tilda, let me-- -Bye! -Tilda? -MATILDA: Hi. -Hi. I have an appointment. Matilda Ross. -You're very late, Matilda. -Sorry. Um... Are you here alone? I'm afraid we can't see unaccompanied minors. Oh, um... -My grandpa's in the men's room. -Oh. I think he's going to be a while in there. He ate something bad. Ooh. -Poor chap. -Yeah. Okay, then, I'll tell Dr. Edwards that you're here. Thank you. (MATILDA EXHALES) One more. That sounds fine. No obstructions. -Can you help me with my zipper? -Of course. -You've been using the new inhaler? -Yeah. Can I ask you something? Of course. What's Alzheimer's? Why do you ask? I think my grandpa has it. Well, my mom thinks he has it. Is your mother a doctor? -No. -Right. But my dad says my mom knows goddamn everything. (CHUCKLES) Tell me about your grandpa. He gets confused. Does he forget things? Most definitely, yes. That's normal. Happens when you get older. Hmm. I bet you never put a chicken in the wardrobe. Alive or dead? Dead. Fair point. Sweetheart, I baked your favorite cake. I used your recipe. (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLES) I guess I forgot it in the kitchen. I'll be back in a second. Yeah. Don't go anywhere. Now, imagine all these books are your grandpa's brain. And because of the illness, now and again, some of the books start falling over. The moment one falls, he forgets what's inside it. Depending on how he's doing, some of the books might right themselves, but others fall over instead. As the illness progresses, more fall over. And in the end, more books fall off the shelf, completely, until, one day... He doesn't know anything? (SIGHS) What can I do to make him better? Well, you can give him things to do so he feels needed and useful. That's important. When he says or does things that seem odd, you should act like he makes perfect sense to you. Step inside his world. That will help him. Strange. Who put those in there? Oh! (EXCLAIMING) SARAH: Amadeus? Amadeus? Amadeus! -Wait. Wait. -Oh! It's all right. Just stay there, okay? I'm on fire! (CRYING) Amadeus? Are you all right? Are you hurt? I was trying to make a cake. Don't cry, it's... Don't cry, it's okay. Don't cry, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Somebody put their high shoes in the oven. Somebody put their high shoes in the oven? AMADEUS: You're mad at me, aren't you? No, I'm not mad at you, all right? Do you want to have a bite of cake? -What? -You want a bite of cake? (STAMMERING) I'd love to, but you know what, I'm on a diet. No, don't. I'll tell you what, shall we... We'll just have a tiny bite, shall we? A little taste. Okay? Let's get it out of the oven and... Wow! Look at that. (LAUGHS) That's not bad. That was Maggie's favorite recipe. -Really? It's pretty yummy. -Good. Do you want a bit? That's good. Yep. What are you doing up there? Looking for the honey. -Did you bake this? -No, your dad did. Have a bit if you want. It's not nearly as bad as it looks. I ate on the plane. -How was Berlin? -It was good. -Is everything okay? -No, not really. Your father forgot to take Tilda to the doctor's. No, he didn't. I spoke to her. He picked her up. No, she just told you he did. I spoke to the surgery. And by the time I got home, the kitchen was on fire, and so was your dad. I had to put him out. If I'd got here any later, the house would've burnt down, and your dad would be dead. You'd be having to identify him with his dental records, probably. Thank God Tilda was still at the doctor. This is crazy, Nick! This can't happen again! And I'm sorry, but it's your fault! -My fault? -Yes! -How is it my fault? -You're refusing to accept reality! No, the reality that you're refusing to accept is that you weren't here, either. -What? -You could've rescheduled that pitch. -No! -Are you kidding me? It was your responsibility to take her to the doctor. That was the deal. I'm new to my job! I can't call up Serge the night before-- Serge? Oh, now it's about Serge! What'd you pitch this time? Your boobs? I'm sorry, what? No, I'm curious. What did you pitch to Serge this time? Your boobs or your ass? Nice. You're no saint, either! I'm not the only one who screwed up, remember? Dad. -(SIGHS) -(URINATING) Oh, my... Dad, you wanna shut the bathroom door? Are you going to get the fridge from his room, or am I? MATILDA: School finished for the summer. I spent it all with Grandpa, and I showed him London. Grandpa and I went sightseeing, and he taught me that when you gotta try your luck at least once a day, because you could be going around being lucky all day and not even knowing it. ♪ When the miles extend ♪ When I can't pretend anymore ♪ When my power bends ♪ When I'm face to face with the dust on the floor ♪ Life is never fair ♪ None of us can see beyond our eyes ♪ I am always scared ♪ Oh, but I always rise ♪ We're on the upswing, flying high ♪ We're on the upswing, you and I ♪ MATILDA: Dr. Edwards told me that people with Alzheimer's are often best at remembering things that happened a long time ago. So, me and Grandpa used to look at this old photo album all the time. Even though I can recite all his stories word-for-word in my sleep, it was just so wonderful to hear them, because he always looked so happy. Ah. That is the Lido. That's the beach. Grandma and I had arguments with the "lifestyle." -Margaret liked to go skinny-dipping. -She did? Yeah, that would upset the lifeguard a lot. She would just take off her swimming suit and go in nude. She always got her way 'cause she could argue anyone under the table. Where's... Where's that? Well, Saint Thingamajiggy. Look at all these seagulls. Margaret thought they were cute until one of them crapped on her Caprese salad right while she was eating it. (CHUCKLES) I miss Grandma. Me, too, princess. Me, too. You know, when I die, we'll be together up there. I don't... I don't want you to die, Grandpa. Oh, don't be silly, princess. Everyone has their time. And when... When Maggie and I get back together again, we're gonna have one hell of a party! We'll really shake it up. (CHUCKLING) MATILDA: I didn't believe in heaven then, but I thought it was so nice of him to try and comfort me like that. Really, it should've been me comforting him. After that, I started filming Grandpa a lot, like my parents did with me when I was a baby. The way I see it, is when it gets to the stage where he can't remember anything at all, he'll really like to watch these videos. Happy birthday. How does it feel? How does what feel? -To be 76. -I'm 76? -I thought I was 42. -(LAUGHS) What's your favorite color? Red. What's your favorite animal? Dog. How does it feel to forget everything? Oh, it's like a head full of honey. All gummed up. How long have you had this honey in your head? Since I can't think straight anymore. Uh, but I have a... I have a... Let's see, I... (BOTH CHUCKLE) Ruff! Dog. What's that? It's got everything in here I need to remember. It's from... It was written by... Grandma made it for me. May I? (CHUCKLES) Did Grandma know that she was gonna die? No. It must have been me that wrote it. She... She's dead, isn't she? Yes, Grandpa. (SOBBING) See, I knew that. Ooh. And what do you think you might be doing later? (CHUCKLES) Let me check with my wife, okay? (SPEAKING IN FRENCH) Mum. We're gonna have so much fun tonight. But first, we have to have a little toast. To Amadeus. Happy birthday. To me? What? A toast, Amadeus. For your birthday? I'm not thirsty. No? (CHUCKLES) -One more time? -Yes. ALL: Happy birthday! I told you I'm not thirsty! Are you an Alzheimer, woman? The aioli. VIVIAN: Well, the champagne's good anyway. SARAH: Yes. NICK: Dad, Dad... That's to dip your bread in, Amadeus. -Oh, God. -Uh... -Goodness. -NICK: Dad, that's not soap. SARAH: Don't put it on your face. NICK: Dad, that's to eat. That's for eating. Oh, dear. Sweetie, not you. No. -Don't, don't... -SARAH: Tilda, stop it. No. -Don't. -You're encouraging him. Don't. Mum, tell her. -No, no, you're the mum. -NICK: Don't play with your food. -Thank you very much for that. -Thank you. Thank you so much. Well, I read that olive oil is really good for your skin. (BLOWS NOSE) So, where were we? I think I'm going to have sea bass. Sea bass. -With asparagus. -Mmm-hmm. What's it called when it's still very hard? (CHUCKLES) Al dente. Yes. -And you, madam? -I would like the tuna tartare, please. -And you, miss? -Mac and cheese, please. That's an excellent choice. That's our signature dish. What are you in the mood for, Dad? I just wanna go home. NICK: Sure, we're gonna go home. We're gonna have a little dinner first, for your birthday. How 'bout some... (SIGHS) -Calves' liver, yeah. -No, no, no. Just scratch that order. He doesn't eat calves' liver. -Okay. -Dad. Dad. What are you in the mood for, Dad? What do I eat? -What do I usually eat? -NICK: How about a Caprese salad? Right, yeah? Two Caprese salads. Two Caprese salads. Thank you. NICK: It's okay, Dad. (SOBBING) I just wanna go home. (DOOR CREAKING OPEN) (SIGHS) (AMADEUS SNIFFLING) What's... What's wrong, Grandpa? Well, it feels so... So... Bad? So awfully, awfully, when you don't know anything anymore. Everything's empty. If you want to write, you can't. There's just something inside that's stopping it from happening. Can you still remember what you wanted to write? You... You write. Okay. For Tilda. My dear... -Dear... -Granddaughter? No! I get to decide what we write. Okay. The day will come when I won't remember... (SIGHS) (VOICE BREAKING) That you are you. But whatever happens, you must remember one thing above all else. That I love you, and you are the most wonderful princess I could ever wish for. (SNIFFLES) ♪ Can't touch this ♪ Don't act like a gangster Can't touch this ♪ Don't act like a gangster ♪ You come round making trouble ♪ But you are prancing like a ballerina ♪ (YELLING) Shut up! Just shut up! What's wrong with you, you idiot? What's wrong with you? Mr. Ross, this way, please. I'll come in and hold your hand. -Huh? -Want me to hold your hand? It's an appointment for you, remember? Would you like to come, too, sweetie? -Why don't you come with us? Okay. -Yeah. So, I'll go wait right here. I'm Dr. Holst. Thought we could have a little chat. How are you doing today? -Didn't you just ask that? -No. -So? -So what? How are you doing? -You just asked that. -Perhaps, but you didn't give me an answer. -To what? -To my question. This is gonna be one hell of a "little chat." So, who have you brought with you today? My parents. -(LAUGHS) -Your parents. (CHUCKLING) Might that be your granddaughter? That's... That's what I said. Can you tell me how old she is? She's got so much time ahead of her. Do you know how old she is? Nope. I can't even tell you how old I was when she arrived. You were... You were 66. -Mmm, 66. -DR. HOLST: Sixty-six? Mr. Ross, can you tell me what nine plus three is? Oh, come on. You don't know what nine plus three is? And you call yourself a doctor? (LAUGHING) No wonder they lost the colonies. Well, I'm from Louisiana, so I didn't lose a thing. Well, then, you were on the right side. -Here we go. -Now, I've got a question. -Are you ready? -Yeah. What's white and lives in a bottle? I'm sorry? You haven't answered my question. What's white and lives in a bottle? Milk. What do you put in a milkshake? Milk. And what do cows drink? -Milk. -Aha! Wrong. Water. Cows drink water. (LAUGHS) Now, if you'll excuse me... Where are you going, Mr. Ross? Oh... -I have things to do. -Dad... I'd like to finish our little chat. Well, my assistant will arrange another appointment. Right now, -I have to get to surgery. -NICK: Dad? He was a veterinarian, you know. Hold on, we'll be right with you. (ROCK 'N' ROLL MUSIC PLAYING) MATILDA: For our summer party, Mom and Grandpa agreed he'd stay in his room. In exchange, he'd be allowed to watch the big firework show at midnight. -It's so nice you're all here. -If I may? -Serge? -Sarah! -What are you doing here? -Well, that's a lovely welcome. And your wife's here. Well, she gets easily bored at home alone. (SARAH LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) -Nick knows about us. -What? -Nick knows about us. -How? -'Cause I told him. -Are you kidding? No, I'm not kidding. I'd never have come if I'd known, nor would I have brought my wife. -Amadeus? -Mmm? What on earth do you look like? It's Fourth of July. Somebody has to represent the colonies. -Have you sucked them all? -They're excellent. -You try one? -No, thank you. -(SOFTLY) Help. -VIVIAN: Amadeus! -No, no, don't, Mum. No, no. -Amadeus! Oh, how delightful to see you. You're dressed to kill. Do I know you? Ha-ha, you old soldier. I got to leave. No, no, wait, wait. We're going to party. No, no, no, you're not going to party, Mum. Let him go, please. Nice job, buddy. I'm loving the music. Yeah, it's not bad. It was all LPs in my day. LPs, yeah. Gotta have a wee. Can you watch out here? Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. Hey. There's a problem. -What's up? -Promise you won't get cross. Why would I get cross with you? What's up? -Promise me. -I promise. -Serge is here. -I'm sorry? -Serge is here. -You're kidding me. No, I'm not kidding you. -Well, tell him to leave. -I can't do that. He's my boss. -You tell him to leave or I will. -No, you won't. (GLASS SHATTERING) SERGE: Ah! You must be Nick! Sarah, you certainly got lucky. What a handsome fella. And talking of lucky... -Have you met Nora, my wife? -Hi. Yes! So nice to meet you, hi! Lovely to meet you. Nice to see you. This is Nick. NICK: My hands are... (ROCK 'N' ROLL MUSIC PLAYING) So, how are you finding England, then? A bit quieter than New York? Um, well, we were in Connecticut, actually, which isn't quite the Big Apple, but so... Yeah, Sarah likes to create her own excitement. -Don't you, honey? -Nick. Well, she's certainly shaking up our office. I'm delighted to have her. -No shit. -How's the dip? I love it. What is it? -It's, um... -It's eggplant. -Yeah. -Mmm. Over here, we call it "aubergine." Yeah, well, over there, we call it "eggplant." We can adapt now we're here. We can call it aubergine, can't we? What's wrong with eggplant, honey? It's been eggplant for the last 11 years. I like eggplant. I love eggplant. I'm just saying, what's the big deal? Maybe it is a big deal to me. SARAH: Well, if you care about it so much, maybe you could talk to me about it once in a while. Could you two give us a minute? -No, Nick... -No, it's fine. Serge, don't. No. -I wouldn't. Please. Serge, I... -SERGE: Come on, Nick. Look, I just wanted to say... Listen, I am... What happened with your wife at that Christmas party, it was a one-off. You know, party, booze, going crazy... I mean, let's not sugarcoat it. We've all been there. We've all done it. You've done it. -I've done it? -Penny? -Penny? -From your office? She told you about Penny? Well, I guess she had to talk to someone. Come on, Nico, you've been dipping in the honeypot yourself, you slick bastard. Slurping away at the... SARAH: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! (MUSIC STOPS) Hey, Serge, are you okay? Why'd you hit my husband? Ask her. (LAUGHING) Oh, shit! (SCREAMS) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) The Russians are coming! (URINATING) (SCREAMING) Come on! Come on! (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) Dad, is everything okay? Dad, what's up? I love you. That's the first time you've ever told me that. Did I ever tell you how much I love you? If you have, then I've forgotten. But don't take it personally. Where's Sandra? Sarah. She took off for a couple days. She'll be back. Why would she do that? -Dad... -Did you two get in a fight? You can tell me. I'm your father. Dad, don't you remember anything? No. It's all gone. There's just a hole in there. It's never clear. It is never clear how it will progress. Rapid deterioration may be followed by a long period of stability. Your father likes to hide his confusion behind humor, which I find intelligent, very likable. But what you need to ask yourself is this... Are you prepared to take care of him? Dealing with someone with dementia is a full-time job and it's not easy. If you reach the point... Rather, when you reach the point when you realize you can no longer give your father the care that he needs, you will have to consider the alternatives before the situation becomes critical. I understand, Mr. Ross. I really do. My father had dementia, too. I'm afraid there are no ideal outcomes in this kind of situation. There are simply least worst ones. The best thing you can do right now is find a good home for him and get his name on the list. (PHONE RINGING) Leighton Fisher. Hi, Pam. Can I speak with my dad? Oh, I'm afraid he's not here, sweetheart. Is he at lunch? No, no, he's gone for the day. -I think he went to look at a nursing home. -A what? For your grandpa. Yep, yeah, that was it. What? No. Dad wouldn't do that. Maybe I got it wrong. No way. Shit! WOMAN: I'll be honest, Mr. Ross. Few residents really want to move here. And some do slide backwards, faced with an unfamiliar environment. But they adjust. We make sure they have a routine, which helps, and lots of activities. And they often make new friends, which is nice. -Excuse me. -Of course. (CELL PHONE RINGING) What the... -(WHISPERS) Hilda, no! -Hello. I'm Hilda. You can call me Bunny. -Okay. -We met at the theater, didn't we? Or was it the opera? La traviata! No, I think you're mistaking me for someone else. You're American! -Hasn't he got a lovely accent? -He has, yes. Shall we have a bit of a shag? -Just a little one? -Okay, okay, Hilda. That's enough now. -That's enough now. That's enough now. -Well, think about it. -Hilda... -Or we could do it in the... You may be aware that inappropriate sexual behavior can be an issue with Alzheimer's. Hilda's one of our more challenging cases, but we keep a close eye on things. And we would ensure your father is shielded from female attention as far as possible. Well, that's the last thing he's gonna want, trust me. You might wanna shield them from him. (NICK SIGHS) -How am I gonna tell him? -Don't. He won't understand. Think about what it's like when children go to nursery for the first time. They cry and throw themselves on the floor. And after just three days or so, you can't get them to leave the place. You have no reason to feel guilty if you decide to have your father looked after by other people. In fact, it will be good for him. Mr. Ross, it's a difficult decision, but please don't be concerned. We keep our residents safe and we do everything we can to make them happy. What are you thinking about, Grandpa? Venice. Venice? Tell me again how the pigeon pooped on Grandma's Caprese salad. Grandma and I wanted to take you to Venice when you were older. We wanted to show you where we... Where we fell in... Show you where we... To see where... Did you know that Pittsburgh has more bridges than Venice? (CHUCKLING) I don't believe you. Shall we go see for ourselves? -To Pittsburgh? -To Venice, silly. I can't even find my way to the... What if we went together? I'm no good anymore, at anything. I'm worthless. No, you're not, Grandpa. I love you. NICK: Hi. Nick. -Can I talk to Sarah? -It's about time. -Can I talk to her? -She's asleep. -At this time? -Yes. She's barely slept the last few nights. Why haven't you called? Maybe 'cause I'm not the one who left. Don't play the macho card with me. You're the one who ruined her party, and made sure that everyone found out about what happened between her and Serge. Good work. Simply astounding. -NICK: I'm sorry. -Well, you tell her that. Well, that's why I'm here. How's Amadeus? He's worse. I think I'll put the kettle on. We're all out of tea, so I thought this might do the trick. Lovely. (NICK CLEARS THROAT) VIVIAN: Hmm. -It's a martini. -Hmm? It's a martini glass you're looking at, and if that's all you're gonna do, -I'm gonna go back upstairs. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being a dick. I'm sorry I punched the guy, although he had it coming, and I'd do it again. Look... I just want you to come home. I just want to make everything better. (AMADEUS SNORING) (WHISPERING) Why is Grandpa sleeping in your bed? He had a bad dream. He thought that the Russians were coming again. You're a really wonderful girl, you know that? I'm very proud of you. See, I can take care of him. You don't have to put him in a home. Grandpa can't stay in the house on his own anymore. You know that. It's too dangerous for him now. You want to put him in a home, too. No, I want him to be somewhere where he's safe and happy. Happy? Happy in a home? Well, why don't you put me in a home? -I would be happy in a home. -Tilda, that's not fair. The place Dad's found is so nice, and it's really close by, and we can go every day and visit him, and pick him up and take him out on fun days out. Fun days out? I barely even know what a fun day out is. -You and Dad are always working. -Well, we'll work less. -That's what you said last year. -It's all gonna be okay. I promise. Okay, well, good night. MATILDA: "I promise you." Mom and Dad have promised me a million times that they'll work less, but they never actually do it. It's just work, work, work for them. Back in Connecticut, Smilla's dad said that the worst thing parents can do is to make promises to their children and not keep them. I stayed awake all night and thought about what Dr. Edwards said, and about Grandpa, and about the fact that he needs a purpose. That's why I had to take things in my own hands. (WHISPERING) Grandpa. Wake up, wake up. -They're back? -No, they're still sleeping. As long as the enemy is sleeping, we're safe, then. Exactly. Now let's go conquer Italy. I have to go to surgery. No, you're not, Grandpa. You're on a holiday. Outside in 10 minutes, all right? What are you looking for, Grandpa? Someone stole the steering, the steering thing. It's on this side, Grandpa. This is England, remember? Ah. Why did the Siamese twins move to England? -I don't know. -So the other one could drive. (LAUGHING) Well, what are we waiting for? Grandpa, I can't drive. Boy, I can't remember how the... The, you know... It's an automatic, Grandpa. You have to put your foot on the brake. Yeah. Push that. (ENGINE STARTS) Okay. Purrs like a kitten. Now, the gas. Oh, my God! Nick! Nick! I think that was reverse. No shit, Sherlock. -Sherlock who? -Holmes, silly. I think we're being robbed! You... Get up! You've gotta get up! You're gotta come downstairs.

So, hang on. You're... It's a... -A tentative missing persons search? -Uh-huh. -That's all you can do? -Yep. -That's pretty weak. -Well, that's what it is. The child's in the care of an adult. A barely functioning adult, as I've explained to you. He's more likely to be in her care, for God's sake! You remember him, he was in here a couple of months ago looking for his dead wife! -I don't. -Well, have you got Alzheimer's, too? Not that I'm aware of. Perhaps you could be more helpful, then? -I'm trying to help, okay? -Carry on. -Thank you, thank you. -Please, be my guest. -Your father... -Not really. -Your father drove off with your daughter. -Yes. Do you want us to send a helicopter with an infrared camera or something? That would be great. -That would be fantastic. -I mean, your father is a grown man. No, not really. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you so much for all your help. -My pleasure. Good luck. -SARAH: Great help! Another happy customer. Wow. Do you know how much I... Do you know... I... You know I... You're a smart girl. Just like your dad. Very smart. I wasn't always a very good father. Well, you're an excellent grandpa. Well... How is everything? Very good food. Thank you, that's very kind of you, sir. AMADEUS: It's just that it all comes in huge hunks. I mean... It's very hard... -Hard to handle. -Yep. I know. The size of steaks these days, it's just ridiculous. What about a pizza? And I promise to have it cut up for you. That's great! That's a great idea. You're a very nice man. -I think you're very nice, too. -MATILDA: I agree. (BOTH SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) Always an honor to have a veteran on board, sir. Cheers. SARAH: "Today, I talked to Dr. Edwards for ages "about Grandpa and Alzheimer's and happiness and joy. "Joy is the most important thing for our brain. "It's like the best kind of fertilizer. "It helps the brain grow and repairs it when it breaks down. "Dr. Edwards says you can only reach your goals "if you find joy in pursuing them. "Many old people no longer have goals because they have no one to bring joy to, "and no one is proud of them. "No one needs them. That's why they get sick. "Their brains shrivel up and they can't repair it "because they don't have fun anymore. "Maybe Mom and Dad should have visited Grandma and Grandpa more often, "but they couldn't because they always had to work so much. "When Grandma died, Grandpa didn't have a purpose anymore. "But if I can give him a new purpose "and make him feel that I really need him, "then maybe he'll get better." Can I help you, sir? That's a nice watch you have there. It belonged to my father.

Madam, there are a lot of trains in this country. You know, all sort of whizzing around. Or not. Depends on who runs the rail franchise. As I explained, our daughter is 10 years old. And her grandfather has dementia. He's very forgetful. Happens to us all, madam. This morning I forgot where I'd left my car keys. My wife says I'd lose my head if it wasn't screwed on, you know? Are you saying you're not gonna help us find our child? Is that what you're saying? I've contacted the British Transport Police. Okay? But a child on a trip with her grandpa is not really a priority. The Transport Police will let us know as soon as they've been located. -But look, there are a lot-- -A lot of trains. -Yes, you said. -NICK: Right.

I'm actually working on a secret plan to free Melania. I think she'd like that. -Where are you from? -Connecticut. But now we live in London. We immigrated. Can you please help us? Of course. We immigrants, we gotta stick together. (SIGHS) What are you doing? I can't sleep. Yeah, I know. I can't either. Hey, are you still looking for that honey? Yeah. Oh, my goodness! What a rascal! I must have asked him a hundred times if he had seen my honey. (NICK LAUGHS) You want to know what he said? What did he say? He said, (MIMICS AMADEUS) "I'm allergic to honey." (SARAH LAUGHS) What a mess. You want a whiskey? It's nice to be nice to each other again. You think we fight more than other couples do? -Yes. -You do? Yes, I think we definitely fight a lot more than other couples. Why is that? It's our parents' fault, I guess. -You know what I think? -What do you think? I think it's because we care for each other. And that's why. (CELL PHONE CHIMES) -Who is it? -Nothing. It's not her. -Who is it? -It's Serge. -Serge? -Yep. -Serge. -Yes, he says to say hi. He says to say hi. Yes, you can read it if you want. Oh. "Hi, Serge. How's your jaw, asswipe?" (SNORTS) Stop it. That's not funny. Poor Serge is having a terrible time. -"Poor Serge is having a terrible time"? -Yes. His wife's had him transferred to the Huopalahti office. She had him transferred? Yes, her father owns the company. Where's Huopalalalapah? -Huopalahti is outside Helsinki. -Good. Yeah, I thought you might quite like that piece of information. How come you didn't get transferred? Turns out that I was just the last in quite a long string of indiscretions. (CLICKS TONGUE) Aw, that must feel really horrible. -Almost kind of humiliating. -No. Not really, no. -You sure? -I'm fine. I hate you. -No, you don't. -I do. I really do. I hate you. -No, you don't. You love me. -I hate... I don't. No, I love Serge. -No, you love me. -I hate you. -I hate you so much. -You love me. -You love me. -I love you a tiny bit. Hi, I'm Mickey. I'm from Schenectady, New York. Now I live here in Bolzano. I was in stocks, now I'm a janitor. Just get to the point, Mickey. Anyway. This is to say, dear Nick and, uh... What's your mother called again? Sandra. Dear Nick and Sandra, your daughter has asked me to let you know that she and Amadeus here are doing great and you mustn't worry. As soon as they get to the City of Love, she will give you a call. Go pick them up. "City of Love"? -What's wrong with that? -It's cheesy. Just do it again and say Venice. Oh, no, bella. I'm a one-take kind of guy. Besides, my hair looks great in that shot. -(CELL PHONE CHIMES) -MATILDA: Wait. (CELL PHONE CHIMING) -Did... Did you just send it? -Yeah. (SIGHS IN EXASPERATION) Wake up. MATILDA: You weren't supposed to send it until we'd actually gone there because now they're gonna know where we're going! I... I just said "City of Love." That could be Paris as well as Venice. Right, so I'm traveling from London to Paris via South Tyrol? Why not? I mean, you go from Austin to Seattle via New York. What? -Oh. There he is. Hey! -SARAH: Venice? Our daughter has very expensive taste. I wonder where that comes from. -Your side. -Yeah? What is that? Eh, I brought the cavalry. Mmm. ALL: Hey! (LAUGHS) Buenas noches, amigos. Buenos dias. "Noches" is night. I don't see a moon, do you? -(ALL LAUGHING) -Cavalry? Okay, Professor. Huh. So these are our master criminals? MICKEY: Yeah, this is them. I am Murali, your getaway driver. Better get in the back of the truck now. Why can't we sit in the front? Because you'll be seen. And look at me. I will be controlled for sure. Avanti, avanti. We've to get going before they close the borders. They don't have borders in the EU anymore. -Is that so? -Yeah. -(SHEEP BLEATING) -MATILDA: Come on. MICKEY: Good luck, my friend. I hope you and your grandpa make it to Venice. Thank you for everything. -Stay safe. -MATILDA: Okay. Okay? (BLEATING) Ugh. It smells horrible in here. Oh! I love the smell. Oh, you're such a lovely girl, aren't you? How can you tell it's a girl? I'm a veterinarian, remember? I can tell by her face. (BLEATING) MATILDA: But... She's got balls. Where? Certainly not on her face, that's for sure. Oh, shit! The pigs! What did I tell you? -What's going on? -Police! -Shit. -Shit. MURALI: Hello, good afternoon. What can I do for you, officers? You can hand him your driver's license and the vehicle documents. -You heard him. -Oh, definitely, of course. Hey, whoa. (WHISTLES SOFTLY) You're not talking back to the chief, eh? No. (BLEATING) OFFICER: What have you got back there? -Oh, sheep. -Sheep? Baa! (ALL LAUGHING) What did you just say? Baa! Hey, you don't "baa" to me, capito? All right. So can I go? No, of course you can't. Step out of the car and open up. (SHEEP BLEATS) MURALI: Oh, oh. Actually, I don't think it would be a great idea to disturb them right now. Out of the vehicle and open up. Shit! (SHEEP BLEATING) Why is the ledge down? I could write you a ticket for that. Must have happened when you stopped me. Damn clever, that girl. Oh, that sheep, I mean. One of them is bloody clever, I know it. Just haven't worked out which one it is yet. But I call you first when I find out. Idiota. Perumal.

Honey, no, no, we'll stay here. -This is ridiculous! -NICK: Honey, we can handle it. Just pretend it's lira. (BOTH CHUCKLE) -Thank you. Thank you very much. -Thank you so much. -Enjoy your stay. -SARAH: Thank you. (BLEATING) We've run out of bread. (CHUCKLING) Look at all these lines! How's anybody supposed to find their way around this? We can share this. AMADEUS: Oh... You can have it. I'm in the mood for sheep. -Sheep? -See him? -We could catch one. -No, Grandpa. We're not having any sheep. -A little sheep? -No. -A half a little one? -No! -A half of a little teeny... -No. A little teeny itsy-bitsy one? No, Grandpa. (CHUCKLES) A little itsy-bitsy teeny...

(SPEAKING ITALIAN) Can I help you? We're hungry. Well, I would love to give those tomatoes to you, but they're for the farmers' market in Venice. Come inside. Let's find you something to eat. (NUNS PRAYING IN ITALIAN) (PRAYING CONTINUES) Where are the tomatoes? I was looking forward to tomato salad. The tomatoes were for the market, Mr. Ross. I know a joke about farmers' market. A nun goes to this farmer's market, he's selling vegetables, and she says to the farmer, "I would like a cucumber." And the farmer says, "Well, take two cucumbers." (CHUCKLES) And she says, "Why two cucumbers?" The farmer says to the nun, "Well, then you'll have another one to eat!" (AMADEUS LAUGHS) I'm sorry, I don't understand. Well, if she eats one, then she'll have the other she can use-- To eat the next day. Ah... (MATILDA AND NUN LAUGHING) (ALL CHUCKLING) Um, so what do you guys do here all day? -Could I explain my joke, please? -No, Grandpa. Um, is it true that you are not allowed to have sex? (BELL RINGING DISTANTLY) That is right, my child. We live in chastity. See, that's what I was saying about the cucumber! Ow! What's chastity? Well, we abstain from loving a man, and we do not allow ourselves to be loved by one. Mmm-hmm. We reserve that place for God. So... You are, sort of, all married to God? Yes, you could say that, my child. So, no one can get jealous or cheat on each other? (CHUCKLES) Is it okay with you if my parents come here? Well, yes, of course. But why do you ask that, my child? I just think they could learn a lot from you all. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) NUN: In purgatory, we get the chance to have our sins forgiven. To make ourselves pure again. So that God can receive us in heaven. -Do you believe in heaven? -Of course. Only heaven makes our lives complete. And when we die, we all live there together with God. Do you think my grandpa will go to heaven? From what you've told me about your grandfather, I'm sure he will. Really? Yes. You know, Matilda, what you are doing for your grandfather is extraordinary. You are a very special girl. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Are you looking for someone, Grandpa? Yes. Margaret. Have you seen her? It's my... It's my grandma. She, uh... She went to heaven. Come on, I'll help you. -AMADEUS: That's right. -Grandma? Margaret? Grandma? -Grandma? -Where is she? We'll find her. Grandpa, I found her. Maggie? Maggie. Maggie. But you went somewhere I couldn't follow you. And I've been... (VOICE BREAKING) I've been looking for you for so... So long. (SOBS) (SIGHING) You're so beautiful.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) SARAH: Fourteen hotels and no one's heard of anything. (NICK SIGHS) Are we sure they were even going to Venice? I'm trying to remember what was the name of the place where he stayed when he came here with my mom on their honeymoon. Was it the Lido? Was it St. Mark's Square? To tell you the truth, I kind of zoned out when he would go on about it. As awful as these few days have been, I feel like we're on the same side again. Like we used to be. (CHUCKLES) We're a team.

(CHUCKLES) "Gooey"? It is. -Deliciously gooey. -Gooey and wet. (LAUGHS) (AMADEUS CHUCKLES) More? (BOTH LAUGH) (FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING) MATILDA: Before we flew back to London, we stayed up until midnight to watch the big Redentore fireworks. We had a ball. Although, Grandpa thought this show was nothing compared to his fireworks at the garden party. Nine months later, I got a little brother. Mom said we should name him Amadeus after Grandpa. I don't think Grandpa really understood that, though. He kept asking what the baby was called and where he came from. But I think Grandpa did understand that Mom and Dad had more time for him because they always kept their promise and tried to work less. I always played Grandpa his favorite songs from when he was young. Dr. Edwards told me music has an unmatched power to completely transform the lives of people with Alzheimer's. Music can really heal them for a moment, and bring them back to us. Grandpa stayed with us for a while after our trip to Venice. We had a caregiver come in and help us with him. Grandpa liked her a lot. But eventually, she decided to leave us. Grandpa liked her blouse too much. When Grandpa went into the home, we'd often visit him. Mom usually got him the honey ice cream he loved so much. Sometimes he liked it, and sometimes he thought it was much too cold. That's the son. I know. HILDA: How would you know? Because he looks like my son. -(THUNDER RUMBLING) -MATILDA: Dr. Edwards told me Alzheimer's patients feel more than we know. He said they need affection, so spending as much time with them as possible is important. On our very last outing, there was a huge storm. It was a massive downpour, like heaven was crying. But we? We just sat at our table in the garden and laughed. The next day, his heart stopped beating. And I'm so happy that I was there at that moment. Actually, I was with him every day, except the day when I got my tonsils removed. "The recent stalemate in Congress "led critics to the state "that for some congressmen, "party has become more important "than the business of the House." Ugh. Man, this is so boring. (WEAKLY) You got that right. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Do you know who I am? Of course I do. You're my little principessa. (SNIFFLES) (EXHALES) MATILDA: And then, he was gone. (SNIFFLES) (KISSES) (EXHALES) (CRIES SOFTLY) (KISSES) Arrivederci, (SNIFFLES) Grandpa. (SNIFFLES) -(MOUTHING) Come on. -Let's go. Goodbye, you old rascal. I'll see you upstairs. PRIEST: There is an appointed time for everything, and a time for every affair under the heavens. (SHEEP BLEATING) There is a time to give birth, and a time to die. A time to weep, and a time to laugh. A time to embrace and a time to be far from embraces. A time to be silent, and a time to speak. A time to plant, and a time to uproot the plant. Where's Tilda? (WHISPERS) She's over there. She didn't want to see the burial. (SHEEP BLEATING) Grandpa? Did you say something, Grandpa?
