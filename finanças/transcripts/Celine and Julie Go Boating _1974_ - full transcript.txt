Right! A boa constrictor that stuck it to me Not dangerous, I put him around my neck When the natives killed the biggest tiger of all, they said... ...it was the Bengali tiger From Bengal, the region of Africa we were in. Do you know it? It's a blue and brown bird I was the Pigmy emperor's guest But Zouba the Giantess was jealous She wanted to marry the emperor who'd given me the tiger-skin But since he had given it to me... Not a bare skin? Zouba wanted to skin me So I ran I almost croaked coming back from the jungle I lived through hell I lost my hair all over, plucked clean I was scared to death. I was traumatized - Tomatoed? - Yes, freaked out I was invited to Hong Kong. A cool place, I'll tell you some day A Japanese guy there did acupuncture. He did it to me After a month... ...my hair grew back, red at first, then the usual Then I came back - Who's he? - That's Grégoire Known as Guilou A distant cousin from childhood holidays We were lovers, we had our innocent games Playing hospital, etcetera On Sundays we'd get married in the grass behind the presbytery Naked as worms, solemn as popes Now Guilou's back He's written. I'm waiting But he wants a white wedding in church What's this relic? A forgotten forget-me-not Isn't it a marguerite? You're right, ifs not a marguerite, ifs a daisy It was a daisy We'll see to that Mind if I use alcohol? Does it hurt you? It's all right I have a first-aid certificate How did that happen? I thought they were after me, so I ran I fell, I was scared But who are they? Scared of what? I'd been hired to work in a house Then two days ago... it was fine until then... ...two days ago I found in my room... ...a bracelet with a foreign girl's name on it The girl before me, I thought, so I took it to my master When he saw it he turned pale. I thought he'd hit me He locked himself in his study with his wife She cried, he shouted, I listened. Then the other woman came So I went away I kept out of the way, poked around, looked in drawers... ...and in one drawer I found two passports... ...with foreign names - one was the name on the bracelet But the photos were torn out Yesterday, when I wanted to go on looking... ...drawers and cupboards were locked. I tried to force a drawer They caught me at it I ran away and now they're after me Who are they? The master and the two women What did you do in the house? Nanny - There were children? - Of course - How many? - One A little girl? How old? Young, seven or eight Were the women dark or fair? Dark and fair I don't know their relationship, they were very secretive What did he look like? Grim? Him? Like your fish Black All done Relax I'd kill for a Bloody Mary! My head hurts Relax.

See you soon To my Julie. The child has become a man It seems people live here Nestor! Fancy meeting you Guess who I recognize those gentle hands... ...the sweetness of this skin, the pulse of this breathing Guilou, you haven't changed a bit Do you remember that Monday... ...when I wildly picked 313? 311, because five of them were dying purple crocuses Those days of blind man's bluff, when I couldn't find you I had no dessert Yet playing Hot and Cold you found the farmer's wife hottest Josette was always after me, even in church after Mass Has the presbytery lost none of its charm? And the young girl... ...none of her innocence? It's just as I'd imagined. Nothing's changed The cobwebs caressed our bare feet... ...they were silky and soft When I pressed you against the hedge to kiss you, no one could see Red mouth smeared... strawberries crushed in milk... ...sugared kisses, four o'clock, snacks, heat... Kisses and rhubarb jam, cigarettes stolen from Uncle Edouard... We blew blue smoke rings The forget-me-not song... white sun, brown stomachs... ...the wind howled and we danced and we loved... ecstasy! Ecstasy! Perverse and mystic sodomization Homosexual spleen in the barn, disguised as Alsatians Sodom, Gomorrah, teeth grinding, loins burning... Hot lava... sleep... Sleeping, dying of kisses, sleeping, kisses... Sleeping, kisses... Sleeping, kisses...

Blood ties must be renewed Must I go on till this ghastly story ends? My dear friend, what you have begun you must complete Miss Angéle I've no idea where they came from But ifs odd, though They mean something to me, their faces are familiar - They come from far away - Yes, they must From very far, but they don't seem at all travel-stained Where do they come from? Zanzibar, Mozambique... When you've finished with your zzzing and your childishness... Look who's talking I don't know if my mind went blank or ifs hazy dreams It's a mishmash It's like four petrified images of puppets Yes, puppets... but they shout... meat sweets, faint... ...tell stories... ...fade from grey to blue... and they swoon Totter down stairs... ...and to spice the sauce, a little blood. Wonderful! - You know what? - No, not yet. I'd rather not know Why? It will be great You don't know the best bit. Hold on to your seat You know the lady in white? She's my sister My twin sister.

A baker' s dozen ...l had six months being coddled by you... ...then she told me Uncle had been kidnapped by a playboy... ...and taken by helicopter to the Peloponnese Your father did well to leave God rest his soul What's become of your mother, with her problems and her men? I couldn't stand her I liked my doll uncles, though... they were so polite Do you ever hear from her? She flits around, sends me a card every few months The last was from Java So she is still the same Poupie, do you remember? The little girl from the house over there After you left she was very ill. After you left she became difficult One day everyone left, I never saw them again, they never came back No news of them She was my age Their nurse scared you, remember? No one came back? Never.

But now that I've found you, I'll come for tea, I promise - It's been too long - See you soon It's broken It's in pieces Do I swallow them all?

Nothing you don't already know, Camille You chose the wrong day for trying to seduce Olivier ls that all? You pretend to be unaware of the vow he made when his wife died What vow? My sister spent her time trapping people with her vows Don't insult that day when you speak of her But if I must repeat it all to you...

Her wish will be respected Let us make a vow Despite my vigilance, the key to the red cupboard is missing What key? Have you seen it? - Don't hit it off, do they? - No, somethings going on I'd say one is a real slut.

He's a girlie! Another one! Monsieur wouldn't consider the mountains? Olivier, a dreadful thing has happened Do not go in there! Do you think it could be... Angéle?

I always let myself be overcome by... ...irrepressible waves of feeling When I was childish... ...they told me I was a real star... ...a shooting star... ...and a gloating star, because... ...l had a big rayon tutu They said I was suppleness itself... ...because I could put my legs around my neck And now I want to express my temperament, my spontaneity I'm very lively And...

These flowers are so pretty I thought I'd told Mademoiselle Camille... ...that the sweetest scents are odors harmful to children These plants are so pretty I thought I'd told Mademoiselle Camille... ...that the sweetest scents are odors harmful to children Do you think so? Pretty things do us no harm If you say so... Mademoiselle runs risks I'll leave the roses to you, because of their thorns Goodness does not always do good Mademoiselle runs risks I'll leave the roses to you, because of their thorns Goodness does not always do good - Am I disturbing you? - You never disturb me I was thinking... Today is Madlyn's first birthday since her mother died And as I look so much like my sister... What are you saying? Olivier, give me the key to my trunk I do not want to see those dresses again May I please have the key to the little red chest? I understand your reluctance, but perhaps today... Madlyn would be so happy Look at me. Nathalie's dresses would so become me How lucky that we have the same coloring I don't know what I should think I thought that today perhaps... ...at last these dresses... ...should be mine Mother left them to whichever one of us married first Since my sister's death, they've been locked away They lie languishing in the attic Wrapped in mothballs and rose leaves Fashions return every twenty years, I could wear them unaltered Think of Madlyn How happy she would be Did you sleep well? Today is a big day I disapprove of these little games Come on, be a sport What a heady scent It's hotting up Madlyn, I've told you not to hide under the pillow What is it, Olivier? I've told you, the harm you do her I do her no harm Keep out of this, Olivier She won't get him? Please lower your voices, the child is resting I don't know what I should think Think what you like See, I told you But I don't believe it Someone's used my syringe again. It's unthinkable and could be dangerous Madlyn's still asleep, should we wake her? He does not want her to be woken He has spoken to you about it? No, I am the one who is troubled These frequent naps... This sleepiness is abnormal. He claims ii is hereditary The scent of the plants certainly doesn't help Sophie, look what I've drawn for you Did I frighten you? Isn't my flower pretty? Do not say that word If you only knew the memories that dress brings back to me - The sea, the mountains? - Both The Borromean Islands? She's not bad, you know I know, I've seen it before The Kursaal orchestra She was so pale, so fragile More than I? Who? What? ls it... That thing. You know quite well Your whims again, Sophie Come with me I must talk to you What do you want to say? Nothing you don't already know, dear Camille I'm listening You chose the wrong day for trying to seduce Olivier Always the same thing. I'm bored But if I must repeat it all to you... ...know that Nathalie made him swear... Stop. I'm having fun, ifs funny You can tell me later Good night "Because I don't want Madlyn to suffer what I suffered at her age" It's a terrible vow No one has the right to make anyone swear it What a bitch! Despite my vigilance, the key to the red cupboard is missing What key? Have you seen it? Tied around the neck of the bottle was a label with the words DRINK ME She drank it... the liquid inside it... ...and became tiny Mummy! Help me Take care of her Don't be afraid, why hide? That was Camille, it wasn't your mother Don't be afraid. Would you like a sweet? I have one It's over I'll never be able to... she hates me I'll never get her to love me lam tired Discouraged again It's just as it was ten, fourteen years ago When Nathalie and I were young. She never loved me, either But she was so clever It was never Nathalie's fault, it was always mine "Why are you so shy, Camille? Why aren't you more like your sister? "You must get out. Lets go dancing, to the theatre, to the country" "Come, Camille, come" She was the first to say those things But I was silent and refused everything Why? Why, they wondered? But I knew why. I knew what was hidden behind her kindness... ...her compassion Yes, her compassion She wanted to destroy me, to make me disappear And she... What a shock I don't see anything now Let's put them back in, see what's next Wait, I want a smoke. Interval, right? No, I'm going on You can tell me about it Wait, I'm coming, too Coming? Hurry You are very gloomy. I don't like seeing you like this Your concern touches me, Sophie, but I have good reason - Camille's appearance upset you? -It does not concern Camille I understand It's what she has awakened in you Don't think of the past, think of today, the birthday we celebrate Look. The doll I bought for Madlyn I'm sure she'll like it What would we have done without you? You are a second mother to her Everything I've done... ...I've done for you, too, Olivier Do not forget that And I hoped that you could perhaps... that we could... Alas, Sophie Madlyn can draw us no closer But is it what you wish? I wanted to be sure Nathalie's vow... I respect it as much as you do But you will hear of it no more It's not much like I thought Not at all How is your hand? Better, but I must be careful Every moment brings peril Happy birthday, Madlyn! You know, inspiration is so fragile... You can't refuse. Madlyn would be so happy - Please, for us - You are cruel A sonata Another sonata Classy No, I don't know I'll begin again My injured hand... You are so beautiful, in that red You are known as the greatest catch in New England I must put my glass down It's divine. I'm tipsy So beautiful, in that blue Hold me close I lived just for you, my heart traced your footsteps Naughty girl! The rogue A lofty tower, a bewitched prince... ...and a tree with daggers And the Blue Bird! - What blue bird? - Don't you know that story? It's very amusing An bewitched prince tries to reach his beloved in her prison tower But a wicked witch has hidden knives and razor blades in the trees The bird is wounded... ...and bleeds Stop! All that blood Blood ties should be renewed Must I tell this ghastly story to its end? My dear friend, what you have begun you must complete Excuse me, ifs time for the child to rest Madlyn, be good Don't worry, my dear, you won't be disturbed I rarely have the chance to tell you... ...how satisfied I am with your services lam duly recompensed, sir Not in the way I would like Madlyn is fortunate... very fortunate... I've run out I've finished, too Madlyn is very fortunate - I'm so disappointed - Yes, but... - It's just padding - We still don't know who did it We've learned nothing more. What do we do? It's full of holes I don't know, ifs like Gruyere cheese We don't know the end. I hate that Anyway, we're not going back. I have an idea At the library... The library?
