Yooo, I told you we should have stayed for Lori's party. Camping out here is going to suck. Screw you, AJ! You said you had a special spot, next to some girls camp... and that we where going to score some weed. It's your fault we are here! Whatever. I just hope whoever can point us to your mystery camp. I'm not trying to spend two hours backtracking down the road to where we started. I Don't know who would want to build a place like this in the middle of nowhere... I just hope someone's home. Great, nobodies home... this is some old rich man's vacation home or something... Screw it, call me Goldilocks. I hope whoever lives here isn't a survivalist or Anything. I'm not trying to die up here. Whatever, Jerry, maybe there's some hot chicks here... or beer. Holy crap, this is a pretty nice shack. No kidding... Hello! Anyone here! If we get killed up here, I'm going to be so pissed at you. Whatever... don't be such a pussy. Hey... excuse me... Sorry didn't mean to scare you... Ya we knocked on the door, Guess you didn't hear it. Guess not. What can I do for you? We were taking the old road to a campground down by the beach... Nobody seems to take the old road any more. We noticed. Yeah, looks like some trees went down across the road. We couldn't get around them. We were wondering if you knew some other side roads? The winds u get pretty crazy up here. You going to camp? We were trying to. Is there still a girls camp down by the beach? I don't know. But I do know it'll probably be a day or more before the road department clear's up those trees. Damn... That's just great. What a waste of a weekend. Don't blame me. You know, it'd be a shame to waste your weekend. You're more than welcome to stay here. There's plenty of room. Wait, you want to stay the weekend here? What about your parents? Relax, they think we're camping. Who gives a crap? Man, look at this place. Live it up. Hey, you have any beer? Uhh , Probably... Sure. You boys old enough to drink? Of course we are... Yeah, we just look young. Works for me. AJ likes to have fun. No problem here. I'm sure it'll be fun. You definitely have a nice place, Sebastian. What do you do up here anyways? Oh, I'm looking forward to... enlightenment. Ah, you're into that mystical stuff? Something like that. Yeah, screw camping. This is much better. Glad you like it. Your rooms OK? Hell yeah. You sure this is OK? We can use the hot tub or gym whatever? I'm just sharing what I have... I'm sure you'll return the favor sometime. Kick ass. Hey, you mind if i see what's in the kitchen? I'm getting kinda hungry. Good idea. Let's see what's cooking. I'll be right in.. Look at this place, Lance. It's stupid and fake. They took what was probably a pristine stretch of land and ruined it. Ken, please... let's just see what the deal with the road is. Hello. My name is Ken, this is Lance. Is this your house? Uh, Sebastian. And... yes... for now anyway. Well It sticks out like a sore thumb. How did the powers that be even allow you to build such a place? Sorry for my friend, we're hot and hungry, the road ahead is blocked by some trees and we're both... Cranky and tired? Sorry about that. Just kidding. Why don't you come on in, take a load off. There's some other waylaid travelers in the kitchen. Thanks... See, the owner is OK and it's much nicer here. I never wanted to go on your commune with nature camping thing anyway. You needed to get out of your house and off the computer. I was doing you a favor. I liked it when we played MMO's and left the real world outside. Well I can't help my environmental awakening, Lance... I've read so many books. it's a beautiful thing. How is everything? It really hits the spot. Thanks so much. Yeah... thank you. You met your fellow travelers, AJ and Jerry? Yeah. So, you were going camping? Yes. These woods are full of energy. That's something Lance here doesn't get. This is mother earth. This is the power of civilization just out there, waiting to be taken.-- you know, you're right. Too many people don't even... ya. exactly. I wouldn't mind speaking more with you about it. If you don't mind. The subject interests me. Um... yeah. I'd be happy to. I spoke to someone at the highway department. Looks like the road won't be cleared till tomorrow night at the latest. You're welcome to stay here. Plenty of room. I don't know... we could just head back. Another two hours in a small, sweaty space with you... no thanks. We'd love to. Thanks. Take an empty bedroom... wherever. Enjoy the fruits of my labor. I'm gonna grab my stuff and take a shower. Feel free to use the hot tub..exercise room... whatever you find. Man, What a beautiful view. Even if it does belong to mother nature. Oh, Ya, AJ stold me you were some sort a tree- hugger or something. I don't expect most people our age to understand. They're too busy indulging, in simpler pleasures. Just be honest, say a few hotties in bikinis happened on Sebastian's place... and they had a ton of sticky bud with them your love for nature would expand a little bit Right? If they were nice, I guess. Oh, Ya in my mind, they're real nice. See you're not as bad as you seem. Man, I'm just screwing with you. Laugh a little bit. I'm not going to lie this nature is screwing with me a a bit , earlier I took a nap and had the craziest dream.. You did? About What? I don't know. But it was crazy real though... and kinda hot in a weird way... I just need to get laid. This place has energy. How do you know, Ken? The earth is full of ley lines, alignments of geographical monuments and places of spiritual power. I just read a book on it... Awesome. I hope your book says I get laid on the ley line... I need to... get something.... you know... He was right, about this place. Yeah, probably. Doesn't mean he's not a nerd with too much time on his hands. Is that the door? Sounds like it. Hello, sorry to bother you, but we were traveling down the road looking for... You ran into the roadblock? The what...? Bunch of trees blew down on the road up ahead. I have some weary travelers waiting it out until the road's clear tomorrow. Yes. A roadblock. I suppose we're stuck here. I suppose you are. The Highway department is closing the other end of the road overnight to get their trucks up here. You wouldn't return now if you wanted. My mother would like to rest, I think. Isn't that right mother? Yes, Thomas. Thank you. I'm Thomas by the way. Sebastin! And this is my mother, Virginia. You'll have to excuse my mother. Have to keep her a little extra 'calm' when we leave the house. I understand. There's a spare bedroom upstairs, if that works for you. I'm easy. I can show you the room upstairs. There's plenty of food in the fridge... This house didn't always used to be here, did it? Mother..I don't think now is the time for your little antics ! I dont know it came to me as is! It spoke to me ! This is the place. It's a mask. Enough! Mother, Why don't you go outside and i'll set up your room. You don't know what you're saying. Is she going to be OK? She'll be fine. Hello there... Hey this trip just improved a thousand percent. Hey my name is Jerry. Virginia. Are you single, Virginia? Woah,, Hold the brakes man, the lady just got here. Can we get you something? The place is ours. Not ours, but we know where Sebastian hid the booze. And you are gorgeous. I can say that, can't I? She is gorgeous. She is. Yes, my mother is quite beautiful, isn't she? That said, I'm not sure I want to be calling either one of you 'step- dad' either. Look we were just paying her a compliment. Oh, I know. And truth be told, if you had the money to spend, I'd happily call you daddy. But I'm guessing you don't. You don't know what I got. But I'll show you if you want. Say goodbye to the boys, mother. We'll see them later, I'm sure. It's time for your nap. Yes, Thomas, thank you son. That family is a little to close.. Little to damn close if you ask me. I don't care, I'm still going to hit that. Hey, you're still guests in this house. Sorry about that. Yeah, we apologize. Yo, You say there was a gym in this place? Yeah, downstairs, first door. I'm gonna go work out. Gonna need my strength later. Can you believe that stupid jerk? I don't want any trouble, Thomas. I don't even want to be here. Mother, I told you, you needed to come back here. to see where it happened and find some closure. So you keep saying. I'm trying to help you. I'm on your side, I've always been on your side. I just want to see you get back on your feet. Get to work. I don't want to be your caregiver forever. You keep cashing the checks, don't you? Oh, Mother... you're tired. I just want to see you move on. Take a nap. You'll feel better. I'll bring in your pills later. You're a good son... Who are you? Um... hi, I'm Lance. You friends with those jocks? No... not at all. Good. They have no manners. Not really. My mother is napping. Stay away from her room. Hey, have you seen AJ? Nope. He told me he was going to the gym, but he's not there. He's not in your room? No, He's not in your room? What about you? What about me? Have you seen AJ? Maybe he's out buying steroids or clubbing baby seals or something. Don't be dick. Whatever, I'm not his keeper. Hey, calm down, he has to be here somewhere. Maybe he just went for a walk or something. Yeah... probably. Did you meet the other people who are here? Thomas and his mom, Virginia? Just for a minute. Why? I overheard them talking and they mentioned something about what was here before this house. Yeah, so? I did a little research and you know what was on this Exact spot 12 years ago? Carmichael Bible college for boys. But it burned down under mysterious circumstances... and by mysterious I mean no one even bothered looking into it, not even the parents of the boys who died. Students died here? Yes, as well as the head priest and a superintendant named Bouvier. Hm... I knew I felt some weird energy the second i walked in this place Virginia, the mom; Bouvier is her last name. Near as I can tell she's this dead woman's sister. Thomas said he wanted her to get closure. And one of the accounts mentioned voodoo rituals... it's no wonder no one wanted what happened here made public! Did you ask him about it? Heck no, that guy is all-kinds of creepy. Seems like more than a coincidence. I was reading this book about stored energy and how it sometimes needs to be unlocked by people with a connection to whatever made it in the first place. You think Thomas brought his mother here to trigger to some sort of Voodoo power This isn't a fantasy video game, Lance. Energy, power, whatever you call it's nether good or bad. It's who ever wielding it that can cause problems. Just let me know if you find out anything else. What's happening here? What's going on here? LANCE !! Sheesh... you scared the crap out of me. You're right. There's something about this place... There's a spirit energy about to go off... like an unexploded bomb. Well what the hell are we going to do. I'll find it... That sounds like a terrible idea. Who are you? I'm Lance... are you OK? I'm fine... My son... He has my pills. I saw him awhile ago. But are you sure you need the pills? He tells me I need them... He says a lot of things. I don't want to interfere with you and your son... He'd only care if you interfered with him spending my money. Oh.. Can I tell you something? Sure. This place... it didn't used to be this mansion. I know. My sister died here. She was involved in some very bad things. You don't mean the Bible school do you? It's Voodoo isn't it? My sister.. She wanted me to be involved. She said I would like how I felt if I joined her... You seem like a nice person who deserves to live her own life; not your sister's life and not your son's... I hope you know you can stand up for yourself. Mother, Mother you need to get back in bed. I don't want you talking with anyone in this house again. They're just going to make your recovery harder. And they'll all be gone by tomorrow anyway. Whatever you think is best. I'm going to have a talk with Sebastian. I know he knows the history of this place. We're both going to help you move on. I trust you... Come on, I know there's a source here somewhere... ...Incense...? Now what is this? AJ, where the hell are you? Is someone there? Oh wow, why doesn't anyone know about this... What the hell...? Where'd the wifi go? Where the hell is my cell phone? Oh, I wish we had gone camping after all... Virginia? Are you in there? This sucks... Virginia? Lance... Lance! No i didn't do this ! The cops can figure that one out! Let me explain? No!! Lance, Please open the door! I didn't kill Ken. I found him like that. Something bad is going on here... You think? Please, I'll explain everything. Fine. Do it from outside. Virginia! Mother, get over here! Oh, please let me in... it's Thomas... I never should have trusted him... you're right. please. he's going to kill me! Times up, mommy! Please... Lance... Oh... Open up, hero boy! Your time is up. Fine, stay put. But you know, Mother, you've been torturing yourself for 12 years wondering what happened to your sister... and your so close to finding out... I'm sorry. Thomas is right... I have to find out... It's my sister... Why did she kill people and turn them into dolls? How is that even possible? How did you find out about that? I'm a nerd with a computer, how do you think? She was looking to harness this ancient Voodoo power. She and her boyfriend were going to use this power to open the gates to hell. And they used human sacrifices to do it. But they failed? Yes. But I think the energy is still here. And Thomas needs me to open up the portal again. And then what? I need to find my sister. I have to set thing's right. Huhhh... What're you doing!? Finishing this, once and for all. Oh, come on... Virginia, please, let's just get out of here. I can't... Thank goodness for that... You plan is all along? To use me to unlock the secret power that my sister died for? Hell no. I don't know what kind of stupid mumbo-jumbo she was into. All I know is you were getting a nice fat check from her estate every month and I wanted a piece of it. I was going to ride that out as long as I could, but then I got a better offer. What are you talking about? He's talking about me. Sebastian here offered me a deal I couldn't refuse. A nice fat chunk of cash and the keys to this house, all to bring you here. He supplied the road block. It was easy. Thomas is easily swayed by material things. He doesn't understand the cosmic power he's allowed me to unlock. The power of your blood, my dear. Whatever, do your Voodoo and get out already. I want to enjoy my new digs. And take all the bodies with you too. You killed the others? Yes. I cast a spell that invaded their minds, preparing their sacrifice for the alter. Let it be done. Virginia's blood will unlock the power that's laid dormant here for so long... and I will control it. Just so you know, it's not even my house. The real owners I killed before you arrived. I trusted you! You're an idiot... No Sebastian. You're wrong. What do you mean? You misread the scrolls. My blood doesn't just unlock the power.. it gives it to me. No! I've studied the ritual for years! It's my power! No. It's mine. I understand it now. It bin mine to take all along. You've got to be kidding me... No. The power of this place is strong... and it's gotten even stronger with all the sacrifices taken here... What... Was that? My sister. She unearthed something with the power of voodoo 12 years ago. And now... It's mine. Well what happens now? I have a few other enemies to overcome. But I think it would be best if you joined me. Yes, I would like your company.
