WEDNESDAY PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES Thanks, Frédéric. Quite alright Mrs. Chevillard. Careful. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. I remember. Everything started when the TV wasn't in the same spot its been in since my parents moved into the apartment 20 years ago. On the seventh floor, first door on the left. I get home after a hard, anxiety-inducing day of doing nothing. I have only one wish, to get comfy and watch TV while drinking a beer, as I do every night. What do I discover? The TV, my TV, which has always been there, isn't there anymore. It's disappeared. So I ask, "Where is the TV?" Is that why you woke me up? - Did you take the TV? - Why would I have taken the TV? I don't know, but he's accusing you. No, God forbid. As a nobody in this house, I wouldn't accuse anyone of anything. Do you know what I do in the afternoons? Sleep. Do you know why I sleep? Cos I work all night and I'm exhausted! I'm not like some who sleep all night and then spend all day wondering why they never did anything in life! I can see it was wrong to talk. Yes, you were wrong. Anyway, what's not to prove it wasn't him? It's easy to take something and then blame others. What's going on? I could hear you from downstairs. If it carries on, we'll have to pad the walls. You're making more noise than my patients in hospital. It's nothing, Mom. Dad is accusing Hasard of stealing the TV. He stole the TV? No. What are you making up now? No one stole the TV. It's gone. That's all. Talking to one's self is tedious! Yes! It was sick of not being listened, since no one loves it! So it unplugged itself and jumped out of the window. Are you happy now? Silence! Silence! Oh you are the worst, you are unbearable! I'd like a bomb to land on this apartment to have peace! I'm a musician. I need calm, rest and silence! For goodness sake! The doorbell rang. Mom told my eldest brother, "Get it then!" Well, get it then! Every evening, the same. It's not my fault. I never raise my voice… Didn't you hear shouting? Shouting? The roaring, the screaming, the bellowing. Do you know what "bellowing" means? Bellowing? No, I didn't hear anything. Unbelievable. I honestly thought it was coming from him. I doubt it. At home, no one raises their voice. My mom won't allow it. It disturbs the kid when he's doing his homework. Maybe it's the TV. Like last night, like the night before, like every night. What do you mean, my TV? TVs make a noise. They assault neighbors' ears, scream! You're screaming! I'm screaming? You're howling! I won't permit anyone to say I howl! I won't permit anyone to shout at me! You're not a family, you're noise pollution! Do you want me to show you noise pollution? I'll set my dog on you. Try it and I'll eat it. You'll eat Pépette? Go back to your doghouse. What the hell did you get up to in the paramilitary to let a broad beat you up without reacting… Want me to show you? Give it a try, "noise pollution". It's a shame she didn't land on one of you. - It would've made room! - Stop! Christine? Christine! Christine! Christine! That's enough! It was all about the person who could shout the loudest. They no longer knew whether it was because of the TV or the neighbors. Calm down. Ah! Suddenly, Isabelle started yelling: "Do you not care that I'm suffering?" Do you not care that I'm suffering? But no one was listening. Suddenly the doorbell rang again. Hasard moved towards the door. He said… Wait and see how I deal with your broad. For sure, he had decided to fight back. But it wasn't the neighbor. - Rudi? - It was Rudi. He's the youngest of my elder brothers. What are you doing here? - They let me go. - A coincidence? Apparently jails are overpopulated so they chucked me out. No one had expected to see him on the doorstep. Can I come in? They were all thinking the same thing: if Rudi was back, someone had to leave. - How are you? - Good. My parents were sleeping on the couch in the lounge. Christine, uncle and both nephews were in the back bedroom. They had been waiting for social housing for eight years. Hey. In the room next door, there was Isabelle, who had come home after her husband had left her and Julie, who was waiting for her fiancé to return… - You're all wet, aren't you? - Oh… Éric and Hasard were in the room next to them. I was sharing the bed with Hasard since he was working nights. When he wasn't working, I would sleep in the bathtub. There was no doubt about it, we were one place short. Did you get rid of the TV? Were you eating, at least? - Yeah. - If you tasted my mom's… I don't believe you. You don't like anything. - You say pasta, he says his mom. - Sunday, make devilled eggs. Well yeah, with roast beef and fries. - Io sono qui. - Move your bread. - I sent you a package. - Yes, I got it. Yes, thanks. Thank you. Have you heard how you speak? You could have written to me. Personally, I think that the pasta smells like medication. - Give me some bread. - No. - What now? - I don't know. Nonsense. He says the pasta smells of medication. No, I was just saying the pasta… has… how to say it, a strange smell. You're mad, they don't smell of anything. I can smell something. Sorry, but… - They don't smell at all. - Yes, like naphtalene. What? Charlotte, pass me some bread please. The things you say. It's made with butter. - Well, one wouldn't know. - He doesn't care! It's like Patrice. One Sunday, I invite his mom for a meal for a veal stew and at one point, she says to me, "Your stew tastes like dishwater." - I couldn't believe my ears. - I know. Next time I sort the wardrobe I'll put pasta with your sweaters to prevent moths. If I can't even say that pasta tastes of naphthalene… Dishwater stew! I'm not the best cook, but stew… I'm sorry. No one ever told me my stew is like dishwater. - There was no naphthalene in the TV. - Is it? Maybe the butter smells of naphthalene? If I'd known, I'd have put naphthalene in. - Oh yes, good idea. - Go for it, darling. Move your ass since you're of use for once. I was on the beltway, taking it easy, and a bastard from the postal service crashed into me. They towed me away. I hope you're not going to be foolish again? No danger of that, they set me on the right path. Who are you trying to fool? - I'm telling you. - What's the right path for you? - Building caskets. - How awful! - Corpses yield profits. - I don't want to hear that kind of talk. Can I help? That's nice of you, but Eric should do it. Go sit down. Here. What's that? A reference letter for a funeral parlor. Will you apply? Yes. I won't stray from the right path, even if it leads to cemetery. Look, Rudi is going to make caskets. Caskets… I'd never have thought that my son would make caskets. It's awful to think that… I conceived the hands that might build mine. At least we'll know who smells of naphthalene. It's not naphthalene, it's formalin. It's bad luck to speak of this at dinner. One might even say, one can smell death. I think I'm going to vomit. Do you want coffee? No, I'd rather just leave. I'm sick of your crazy talk. It's repulsive. I obviously won't ask if anyone wants to join me. Are you crying because you know I'm going to choir practice alone? It's because I'm going to be alone too. - She's crying… - Alone in my room. She's crying because she likes crying. I'll get undressed alone, put on my nightgown and go to bed. Alone. - Without anyone… - Stop it! I'm sick of hearing you cry! If you're sick of being alone, find a husband or jump from the window! It'll make room. Is that it? Is that what you want? For me to kill myself? You all want me to kill myself. I know I don't have a place here. I know. I know that it would be better if I killed myself… Don't talk nonsense. Come with me to choir practice. You'll see others, it'll do you good. I can't. Music upsets me. Fine… Miss Chevillard, louder. It's too bad, I can't hear you. What are you doing here? I love to watch you sing. That's a lie. You only like rap. Rap and you, when you're singing. I miss you. If only you knew how much I miss you… I know, you're mad about my body. I can't bear it, I'm going to explode. I can't bear it. Only 64 more days to go, my love. 64 days to go. 64 days? Miss Chevillard, do you really think that "64 days" is in Nabucco? It's not me. It's my hands. It's not my fault. They are opening the fridge. I can't help it, can I? It's not my fault. It's happening again. What on Earth are you doing here? - Where do you want me to go? - Where's the kid? Marius is in your bed. That's nice of you all to make the most of me being absent… Hey! You can sleep here if you want. I'd like to be able to use the toilet! Don't worry about me. Go for it. I don't intend to… in front of you. This isn't jail. Get out, quick! - Did you sing well, dear? - Get out! Get out! FUNERAL PARLOR What are you doing? If anyone asks, you know nothing. Can I give you a hand? We're going for a spin, you can't come. Go away. Can't you see it's a two-seater? But… are you stealing the car? Mommy, don't you have shopping to do with that big bag of yours? Have you seen what's on the windshield? What's on the windshield? I don't give a shit, I can't read. "Social worker". Great. Well, I'm a mechanic. I don't know, but I think it's unfair and very cruel to steal a social worker's car. A woman who gave up everything. To give everything to others! This woman is crazy! Hey, are you mad? Why would you cry about a rotten old car? That rotten old car is mine! I'm wasting my life preventing minxes like you from going to jail! Beat it or I'll smash your heads in! - Bitch! We'll get your car eventually! - Nasty woman! I hit them. I hit them. It's… It's awful. Awful. Get out of here! I don't need a dictionary or a rug, and a calendar even less so! No, I… Mrs. Courval, I'm the social worker. The what? Candy, ma'am. I don't have any candy, my dear. No, I don't have candy. - Candy! - Candy! But I… I don't have any candy. I don't… I don't have candy in my bag. Candy, ma'am! Why are you crying? What's wrong with you? Why are you crying? I… Did you ask for assisstance? Not a moment too soon! Don't scratch your nose. It doesn't look nice. I should have been a social worker. Are they all yours? Do you think I'm Snow White and the seven dwarfs? Three are mine and I'm looking after the others! Careful! You're going to make her fall! It's crazy how much paperwork they send! I don't understand any of it, anyway. The more I reject, the more they send. Here. Help me. Do they think I have time to do it? But… can't your husband help you? - My husband? He cleared off ages ago. - Candy, ma'am. Did he leave with another woman? What? I don't know! He left me with one in the belly, saying: "Goodnight, Clara!" …he's going to try to win… It's nice of you to worry about me, but things aren't that bad. My husband left me for a pharmaceutical assistant. Oh… You too? Oh… Don't fret about it, you're too cute! It's not like there's a shortage of men. - Do you have kids? - No, that's why. He left because I couldn't have kids. Ah… We should have swapped. It's unfair! Men need only look in my sister's eyes… and a kid appears. They don't even need to look at me. I've tried everything! I even tried treatments for infertility. Me too. With one of his friends who would pick him up for soccer. Treatments for infertility are so awful… - There's medication and… - And what? You need to make love at specific times for the medication to work. You have to time it right. Oh really? So, Patrice. He was called Patrice, by the way. He had bought a watch with an alarm. And as soon as it rang, we had to… we had to… I couldn't… - Really? - It made me tense. It would make me… Ding, ding! In my head, ding, boom! No, wait, it doesn't matter. Come now. Hey, it's not a reason to blow your nose on my towels. You'll find someone else. Do me a favor. For a start, find a guy without a watch. There. Sit down here. Oh, it doesn't matter. Here. Come on, dry your tears. I still need to visit three families. I'm not letting you go in this state. No, no. Come on. Blow. Come on. There, that's good. I still need to fill in all your papers. I've waited for three months, so it can wait a little longer. Really? - Do you want a cookie? - Yes, please. Thanks. Why are you crying? Candy, ma'am. Can I have a cookie? They are a bit dry. Every time he climbed or went down our stairs, Rudi would stop for a moment on the landing of the fourth floor. He was born there. Mom didn't get to the hospital on time. Very few men know where they were really born. They know the name of the town, the name of the clinic, but that's all. In short, they know nothing. No trace, no memory. Rudi knew that he was born here. There was another reason why he would stop there. There was a madman in town that everyone called Rudi. It was a pseudonym, the name of a lone wolf. Lost in fury, in the estate. Did you enjoy it? I kept all your letters. When did you get out? Yesterday. Four months, 24 days and 17 hours. I'd lost faith. Why did you stay with me? There are other girls. Younger ones. Prettier ones. Free ones. In jail, I only thought of you. No one else. Doesn't it bother you that I'm married? I don't care. You're the only girl in the world for me. You might bump into Milo. I don't care. I'm entitled to the best of you. Milo can have the ordinary side: the shopping, the housework, the frosty reception, your back facing him in bed… I don't know anyone who has a mind as twisted as yours. You. Cheeky! Do you know what I used to tell myself? "They won't get me." "Not with sport, nor with work." So I'd build caskets and close my eyes to imagine you better. I'd create an imaginary world they couldn't enter. So they said I was different. They would go on about forgiveness, rehabilitation, equal opportunities. I hope that my kids will have better opportunities than I did. More opportunities for what? I don't know. Things can change. No, nothing can change. We are alone, we live alone and we die alone. So, there's no point in acting. Yes! Pass the ball! I always hated singing and music. Unluckily for me, I was in the school where Julie taught. And every time we had class with her, it wasn't enough for me to bid farewell to a scarf and other girly things, I also had to crank up the piano. …the captain. I looked so silly, cranking to the beat Crank. I am cranking. I said, crank. Isabelle and Rudi were waiting for me at the end of the school day. They wanted to convince me to go to boarding school. They told me that boarding school was the best thing that could happen to me. You know, Marius, boarding school is the best thing for you. Plus, you'll have your own room. Not to mention the fact, you'll get to leave every weekend. Julie is rotten, she gave me detention for Saturday. What did you do this time? Nothing, I even fixed her piano. Girls always try to force mechanical things. I don't know what's wrong with Julie at the moment but she's in a foul mood. I know how to make her leave. Come take a look. Ah right, now I get it. We tell Riton to come back double-quick? No, I'm going to rat her out. Because she gave you a Saturday detention? She's doing things with a black. Marius, what's going on? It's true. Each time we have class with her she makes him stay after class! What are you waiting for? Get it out. What you're doing is disgusting. Do you want a slap? You're not allowed to make me stay. Get undressed. Oh no. Be nice, it's going to make me really late. Are you getting undressed or do you want me to help? - Will you write me a note? - Anything else? Fine. But quickly, okay? Not like last time. Do you take me for a fool? Yes. I'll tell the cops that Julie can't help herself. It's sexual. I've done some difficult things in life. Very, very difficult. No one wants to take it into account. I even looked after turkeys. It's very difficult to keep turkeys. Try making those bloody creatures cross the road. If you give French people a kick up the ass they march, but turkeys… Right… Two for the price of one. Are you pregnant again? - Is it already visible? - One need only look at you to know. - I'm worried. - Why? Don't you feel good? - What? - Do you know Serge Wilfrid? From the third floor? Who plays basketball? - I think it's his. - Oh? Are you saying it'll be black? If Serge Wilfrid is the dad, obviously… We'll soon know where we stand. Don't worry about your husband. You saw with the second. Men don't know the difference. For them, it's just another screaming kid. Yes, but still… Me too, I was like you. If I liked a guy, it had to happen. Yellow, Black, white, rich, poor… It didn't matter. Sometimes, I see one in the street and I think of the others. I try to remember their faces. Ah! Oh… I partied with that guy! A real champ! Little black! He was so gentle… CACAO BINGO, THE MORNING PUNCH Ah, cheese for pasta. Ah… No… No, I won't take cheese. She must have bought cheese. The cheese was hard to digest last time. What's this? When I think of all the guys I slept with, none meant anything. There was only ever one. Maxime? Hello, darling. When Maxime died, I wanted to kill myself. Destiny had planned for me to survive. So I started going after men. I wanted to drown in love. Every time I was with a guy, it was Maxime who was in my arms. What if you didn't marry Dad? I'd have married the boxer. The black guy? Yes. Tillieux. He could have been my father. Of course. I'd have been black. - Exactly. - I'd have had black kids. Obviously. - Like the one I'm expecting. - Like that one. - So if the kid is black, it's normal? - Completely. What are you saying? What are you saying? That's it quite normal if Christine has black kids. There's nothing more normal. Turkeys. Like the TV, the fridge had disappeared. Someone had taken it, without us knowing who had done it. Mom didn't withstand the shock. She passed out, amongst the apples, oranges and bananas. Julie! Mom… You're crazy! Stop, it's pointless. Why are you getting involved? Let him slap his Mom, if he wants. It's rare that one gets to slap one's Mom. Move. Are you feeling better? I hope I didn't hurt you? Here. A drink will help. What's for dinner? Don't you want to take your cardigan off? When I die, I'd like you to put me in a white casket. And I want flowers. Lots of them. Carnations. Yeah. And I want all the men who loved me to carry me on foot to the cemetery. 12 men, followed by musicians playing slow, sad tunes. Farewell scarf, Farewell… The fridge's disappearance shook Mom more than the TV's. She didn't even have the strength to cook pasta. Mom? Julie? In haste, Christine had to prepare mashed potatoes and ham. Serge Wilfrid, the basketballer player who had come up to see her, seized the opportunity and stayed for dinner. …I said: "I bought a fridge." But no one remembers that. - Ask Mr. Salichon. He'd remember. - Do you want a ticket for Sunday's match? And now… - The fridge is gone. Disappeared. - Yes please! Oh, fantastic. - Out of the window! - Do you want to go? That's easy. It was filled with lots of good things, leftover pork with endives, bread, cheese, two kilograms of leeks, a few turnips, carrots… The carrots have been swiped. You're not implying that I stole the fridge too? Dad, don't worry, we'll buy you a brand new fridge. A Frigobel, okay? - Okay? - Why don't we just sell the accordion? Yes, my dear Serge Wilfrid, my husband is a musician. If someone stole my fridge, I know what I would do. Hey! We deal with family matters as a family, alright? If I may, it might be better to inform the police. No, first we sort it out as a family. Then we call the police. Who did it? Soft butter, not one bit. - Stop it, please. - Thanks. Hey, it rhymes. Oh yes. 'Who did it? Soft butter, not one bit.' Is your home as mad as this? It's worse. Sixteen people. Can you imagine? Sixteen? I can't hack it, I need to leave. Did you ever read Rimbaud? Who? You know, the poems you wrote… You recently wrote poems, right? "Your eyes, my love, like the starry sky…" Wait. Does that mean you've been through my stuff? No. I swear, Julie, I didn't go through your stuff. There was… - A sheet of paper was on… - You turned it over, didn't you? No, it was just resting there and it fell. - It's pretty. - The washing machine is there. Have you got a chick now? Yeah! - She's super cute. - Oh yeah? You won't pick on a negro? What? I'm not picking on anyone. It's not 12 feet. It's only 11 feet, I think. How many feet is a "stupid moron"? - Oh, listen… - You're bitter, jealous, envious. - The poem is pretty. - Full stop. - I wish I'd written it myself. - You're not capable of it. The problem is, you don't have anyone to send it to. That's not very kind. We won't forget. It's not very kind at all. - You didn't have to. - You busybody. The table and the gestures… You're not likely to find a guy anytime soon. We mustn't forget about the match on Saturday. I'm not hungry anymore. Since Éric and Charlotte weren't there, everyone agreed that they must have stolen the firdge. I was going to say it was impossible, that I suspected myself when Mom got up. - Right, well I'm leaving. - Now? I've got a lot to do. Stay seated. We'll wash up, won't we girls? I can help. I'm going to join Maxime. There's a lot of you. I can't leave him alone, always alone. Stop pissing me off with that. Maxime is dead. How would you know? Maybe you're all dead. You're not allowed to say that, okay? You're dead. You too. Yes. That's precisely why I'm joining Maxime. No! You're not going anywhere. I'm like my mom, I remember everything. I even remember when Darrigade won the Road World Championship of 1959. - What a victory. - Who? Darrigade. André Darrigade. Who's that? Don't tell me you don't know who Darrigade is? I know everyone here, I've never heard that name. You can't be that stupid! Darrigade isn't from here, he was a champion. Before Merckx, he had the most Tour de France victories. - Have you heard of Jean Stablinski? - No. And Henri Anglade? Never. It's crazy, no one remembers us. And yet we were great champions. I was the French champion of 1959. And remember, in 1965 I beat you. True, but I was world champion in Italy in 1962. …meet all afternoon… Why is he the only one that remembers? There's always one that remembers. Yes, but why him? He was a kid when we were racing. Maybe that's why he remembers. God, you're boring me. Memories are for old folks. You're happy. You don't know Hitler, nor Mao, nor Stalin, nor Pol Pot, nor Pinochet. Nor anyone. You were born without memory. I know all the names of the dogs on this estate. Dogs don't count. Yes, they count. What would you want me to remember? I'd like you to remember me when I die. Hasard had said: "I'd like you to remember me when I die." Pascal didn't reply. Only Toby started to bark, but dogs don't count. Do as I said. Yes. I've written everything down so that I remember everything. Yes. Don't forget anything. Don't forget I wasn't always like this. How? Like this. Like a wet rag? Like this. - What are you eating? - Shush! No one can know. Everyone was hoping that Isabelle would clear out. There weren't 101 solutions. Either her husband needed to leave the pharmaceutical assistant and return to married life, or she needed to find a new husband, but that wasn't going to be easy, or she needed to follow Julie's advice and jump out of the window to make some room. Isabelle! What's up? You look like you're in such a state. You were going to kill yourself. - Jump… - You've got too much imagination. I know, I was hesitating to tell you but you need to careful. You often talk to yourself. - Alone? - Yes, like Dad. Like the old lady on the fourth floor. Little baby. He must have escaped. Here, take it. - Gently. - You could have fallen… Not at all! If you could see the acrobatics I'm able to do. Apparently men like this kind of thing. Do you not think it seems a bit vulgar? Well yes. It's vulgar. Sir? Um, sir? - Are you the social worker? - Yes. Sit down. Oh… No. Sit down on the beanbag. Thanks. So… A request? Yes? Here, read this. Read it, you'll see. Thanks. "I'm leaving, you're an idiot. Monique." Ah… Yes. Um, I'm sorry but individual cases… I'm not an individual case. There are millions like me. One day, they come home from the office and find that on the wall. Oh yes… Well. I need to go. I… I'll leave you this. There. I'll put it here, on the beanbag. I'm sorry but I need to go. Goodbye. Do you get why she'd take the plants? No. And the windows? No, I don't get it. I don't get it either. Oh yes. Well! Come see the garden. What do you think of it? Pared down. It's a bit like a Japanese one, right? She took the lawn. The lawn? There were lawn strips there. Ones you can roll up, you know? Do you think you can dislike someone enough to the point of taking their lawn? Don't worry, it'll grow back won't it? When one is in love, things don't grow back. - The rooster… - This is just a chick. Don't cry. - Are you not working anymore? - No. What did you used to do? I was a sewing machine sales representative. Don't you have any machines left? No. Have you seen my car? - Yes, it's missing two wheels. - Oh, you noticed. They were a gift from my wife, so she took them as she was leaving. That's sad. A car without wheels is… it's like… a lawn without grass. Najim and Rudi had gone to preschool together, and then to elementary school together. They were expelled from middle school together. Together they started stealing small things here and there. No one wanted to give them a job. In Rudi's case, because of his appearance and in Najim's case, because he's Arab. Bosses dislike guys with broken noses as much as they do Arabs. Do you really think there's a safe in there? Mom's been cleaning the office for 2 weeks. She's always talking about the safe. "Oh, it's so big! Oh, you should see how big it is! "It's got millions in it!" Don't you think she's dreaming? I swear, Rudi. It's on the second floor, we'll have to empty it there. Do you still have the tools? I've got this. To do what? It's part of the stuff I'll talk to you later about. Come on, let's go! Why do you sleep with married women? I wouldn't like sharing my woman with another man. There's nothing to share. Married women give you everything for a nice word or a glance. They are full of love. One need only open one's arms to receive that love. They don't just open their arms. You're just a show-off. Did you imagine these things in jail? Yeah, I had time to think. About that… and about other things. - When's the baby due? - Soon. Didn't you want to give it up? No, I never thought of that. Then you were right to keep it. Can you not have kids? You know, a kid, a dog… It's all the same. Worries and responsibilities… You'll soon find out. Would you rather it be a girl or boy? I don't care. I'd rather be surprised. It's like when we were expecting Pépette. We didn't want to know the sex. Pépette? I can't see her anymore. Pépette? It's disgusting… It's disgusting what you're making me do! What do you get from stealing dogs? Want me to tell you? One dog gets you a chair. Two dogs get you a table. With 2,000 dogs we can buy a bar. How much is a Compact Laser? A Compact Laser is two Pépettes. Okay, fine. I'll carry on stealing dogs, but promise me I'll get a Compact Laser? We'll see. First we'll get the bar. I'm sick to death of being here. I can't wait to live in the countryside. What do they do with the dogs? I don't care. I only like cats anyway. - Do you know why? - No. Because police cats don't exist. Charlotte got Pépette out in Mom's old shopping bag. She never should have done that. At the first jolt it split! Pépette ran off. Pépette! Are you not going to watch the soccer? I've already got the ball. I don't need to watch a match. Mind you, you aren't missing much. I like you, Rudi. You're not like the others. No, Charlotte, I'm like them. No. All the others ought to be killed. All men ought to be killed? Yes. All except you. What would I do in a world of women? You'd love them. With you, I know I'd be happy. You wouldn't beat me. Why? Does Éric beat you? Just because he got me pregnant doesn't mean he cares about me. He says I'm a loose woman. Once he even kicked me in the head. I'll speak to him. You know, I like you Rudi. If you want… If I want what? With my big belly, I didn't even have panties on under this. No one would see us in here. We can't do that, Charlotte. After four months in jail, I thought you'd like it. You've got some strange ideas, you know? Have you seen the lemons that they sell these days? - The lemons? - The ones you can buy at the supermarket. They don't go black like they used to. They dry up if you don't eat them. That's what going on in my head. It's drying up. Like those rotten lemons. Hey, Rudi. Are you out of jail? - Hey, Milo. How are you kiddo? - I'm fine. - So? - And you, my dear? - Are you not with your wife? - No, she chucked us out. She's got a job to finish. We're off to watch the soccer at the bar. I'm going there too. Someone stole our TV. Damn, everything is disappearing at the moment. Fridges, TVs, cars… Everything belongs to everyone, nothing belongs to anyone. Yeah. Everything belongs to everyone. Milo didn't know how right he was. On the estate, there was no one more convinced than Rudi that everything belong to everyone. Yes, what is it? It's me, it's Milo. Open up! Have you got my keys? Is the soccer over? No, it's half time. I need comforting. We're losing two-nil. - Not now. I'm cleaning. - I've got ten minutes. There's time, no? No. You've not done much, have you? I was sorting the bedroom. Oh yeah? How about we mess it up? Come back when we've won. Oh, you're mean. Here. Have a drink and go back. I don't like you leaving the kids alone at the bar. Rudi hasn't changed, you know. He's as crazy as before. We've just got seated when he says TV reminds him of jail. He says you would have to be a moron to just stay put. So the boss says, "Shut up or leave." So he repeats that we're morons and then leaves. We haven't seen him since. - He didn't miss much. - Be quick. - They scored twice! - You'll miss the end. - Okay. - Come on, Milo. Go. - Bring back lemons. - Lemons? Lemons. As always, before starting his shift at the supermarket, Pascal went to fetch Toby who was sleeping in his car to avoid it being stolen. Toby? No one had stolen the car. But Toby wasn't there anymore. Toby? Shit. Toby? Toby! Toby? Shit, Toby! Reply, Toby! Toby? Asshole! Give me back my dog! Toby! Toby has disappeared! Did you go to the car? - Yes, I went back! - To the parking lot? Yes, I went there! I've been looking for two hours! Impossible, he must be hidden somewhere. Shit, you don't get it. All those dogs and Pépette! Someone has taken him! - Someone took him! - Calm down! - Calm down! - Toby! - Shit, stop! Stop, Pascal! - Toby! Toby! - Why would anyone take Toby? - To do experiments! What kind of experiments? Like during the war, the Nazi camps. - How do you know? - I remember! I saw it on TV! They castrated them, injected diseases, they gave them extra limbs! - You're not going to cry, are you! - I have nothing left, get it? I have nothing left, I'm all alone now! I'm all alone! Alone! - As a kid, you said the boys kissed you. - Well, wasn't it true? Yes. It was true. And me, you'd leave me at the movies all day on Wednesdays. I'd have to tell you how the movie ended so you could tell our parents. You loved the movies though. Everything makes you cry, even comedies. People who laugh are poignant. You're my darlings. I'm going to tell you something you can't repeat. I'm ashamed, but sometimes I think I love you more than I do my boys. Hello, ladies. Please could you move forward. Yes. Miss Apolline, please look after these three people. It's very kind of them to do nocturnals. Meanwhile, Jean-Jacques hangs out with his pals. Jean-Jacques is nice. Last night I couldn't finish my movie, he wanted to watch the soccer on TV. That's a shame, the end was… Isabelle doesn't think she's sexy enough. She wanted to go blond. Then, upon seeing the hairdresser, she decided to go red. Men like redheads. Apparently redheads have a special smell that attracts men. Yes, that's it. She would dye her hair red and get a smell that attracts men. - Can you dye my hair red? - What? At this time? Yes. What kind of red? - Red… - Like mine? Yes. A bit more… Okay, wait. Let me fetch the color chart. Thanks. You want to dye your hair red? You're mad… Don't do it. It really damages the hair! And redheads have got a strange smell, a bit sour, like dried sweat. Sorry but red hair is slutty. Just look at her. Is your representative cute? His eyes are like swimming pools. Ah well, he'll like it I'm sure. Being a redhead might suit you. Well yeah… Dye is a pharmaceutical product, it can't harm you. Do you like it? No. No, I don't like it at all. It's very ugly. Yes, very ugly. This is what I suggest. Marius goes to boarding school. Rudi goes back to where he came from. Hasard… With Pascal and his mutt in the Fuego. Yeah… And Éric? - In a caravan. - With his fatty. Um, Dad? In a home. - Yeah, alright. - And Mom? In the hospital staff bedrooms, she'll be comfy there. She'll have to travel less. It's mainly the traveling. It's hard, but there's no other solution. Oh yes, it's hard. That way, there will just be us. Nobody but the girls. Yeah, nobody but the girls. Shush. Don't laugh. I swear when I'm making love, I see landscapes… It's not funny. With… emerald blue seas. And beaches with palm trees. No, simple places. Unknown places. Houses, rooms, streets. As if my body remembers places it has been without me. God, you're so silly. Go to bed! - Where were you? - Ah! - Where were you? - You're hurting me! - Were you screwing your negro? - What? I was at the salon! Have you quite finished taking me for a fool? Hey? Shut up. The kids are sleeping. Tell me… If I catch you with your negro… - I'll kill you and then kill myself. Okay? - Ow. Let go of me… Let go, you're hurting me! Does he screw well? Huh? Apologize. Apologize. Sorry, sorry! Ask him if he's sorry! On your knees! Say, "I am a whore." "Like my mom, like my sisters!" "I am a whore." I'm afraid. Let's walk down. Yes. Gently, gently. Gently. Breathe. There. Come on. What are you doing to her? Can't you see she's about to give birth? For God's sake! Come downstairs. There. Hold on tight. Like this. Just five flights to go! Careful. Breathe. Breathe deeply. My waters have broken. - What? - I can't go further. I need to lie down. Don't worry. When my first dog was giving birth, I was always there. Push. Push, then breathe. Like so. Ultimately, we're only animals. Now push. Come on. Breathe in deep. Pant like a dog. I'm sorry about Pépette. Don't worry about Pépette. Come on breathe! I didn't mean… That's what one says with hindsight. Breathe. Gently. There. Like a brave animal. Carry on. Push, breathe out. Pant like a dog again. It's coming. He forced me… Yes. Yes, that's good. If only we could do without men… Tomorrow you'll dress differently. What's wrong? Don't you like my clothes? If we hit a snag and you're dressed like that you won't even need to make a confession. Find a way to be well dressed. Suit, tie. Like me, in other words. That way, if we get caught, we're two well-dressed guys counting stars at night. Stars can only be counted at night. Are you coming? SECURITY It's a girl, a real little doll! To think you were born the floor below. Our family has just made a massive leap on the social ladder. Wait. I think there's another one. - Are you okay, Dad? - Yes, very well. And you? Charlotte just gave birth on the sixth-floor landing. Twin girls. That's good. Twins are practical. Yes, it's practical. If you lose one, you've got one spare. What are you doing here? Nothing special. I'm watching TV. Comfortably seated on my couch, sipping a fresh beer, as always. Won't you sit down? There's no couch. Oh, I know. No need to worry. If I may, I'd also like to point out that there's no TV or fridge either. The couch has been swiped. Oh, "swiped" … Let's not use big words rashly. Let's just say some things aren't where they should be, and we don't know where they are right now. Don't you think you're going mad? Going mad? Yes, you're whispering, making gestures, you're asking questions, then answering them yourself. I feel like strange things happened while I was away. Time. What do you mean, time? Time passed. That's all. The more time passes, the more things go. Things one thought would always be there. They disappear. I'm happy you agreed to go for a spin with me. I love long car rides. It's been a long time since I went on one. What time is it? You don't have a watch. The one I had was a gift from her mom. She took it when she left. Call me Isabelle. Isabelle. You are beautiful. Isabelle thought she was going to faint. It was exactly as Mrs. Courval had advised. A guy without a watch. You are beautiful. My car! Follow them, they're stealing my car. But, Isabelle, I don't have wheels, I can't follow them. The cockerel. Isabelle… MEDICAL UNIT, PSYCHIATRY UNIT - Why are you visiting me here? - I'm leaving. Are you seeing your sister? No, I'm leaving. - Did you steal the TV? - The TV? Why would I do that? Not the TV, not the fridge, nor the couch? Why are you leaving? I'm going to die. You're always complaining. I'm not complaining. Look, it's there. A contracted solar plexus. You eat too much. Not even. I'm being eaten. - What are you talking about? - It's true. There's something inside that's eating away at me. Anxiety. Anxiety from what? The anxiety of being. I've never loved anyone but you. I hoped to be able to make you forget about Maxime. - That's in the past. - Oh no! It's there, between us, like an invisible barrier, an invisible wall that is impossible to destroy. You always thought I was ugly, didn't you? - Ugly? - Yes, ugly, gross… Awful to look at. Stop eating pasta! See, I don't even know what you think of me. Ugly, gross. It doesn't matter to you. I'm not Maxime, I'll never be Maxime. That's what you see. If I was green with antennae, it wouldn't make a difference to you. - You wouldn't see the difference. - Nonsense… No! I love you! And I only have you! Get up! No, I can't. I'm destroyed. I want to eat. Get up. Come. If only you knew how much I loved you. Julie! I'm free! I'm discharged. Yeah! Tonight, just you and me, in your large bed. Oh yeah! I've been waiting for this for months I've only wanted you, since the army. Your dad, mom, dog, neighbors. Tonight, I only want you. Julie, I love you, It's been so long that I've wanted you. Oh yeah Julie… You… Yeah. Miss Chevillard? I believe this freak wants to speak to you. Who, sir? This one. No, it's nothing. It's just a figment of my imagination. A figment of what? It runs in the family. My dad talks to himself and my mom sees absent people. Sorry. Are you still crazy about my body? On your marks, guys. One… I say, Éric, is it true you beat Charlotte? - She said that? - Two. I don't really like guys who beat up their girls, you know? It takes a lot of effort to make her understand something. Three. Don't do it again. What does it matter to you? - So? - Four. So, if you beat her, I'll beat you. We'll see if you're still a smartass when you have to face up to a man. I'm your man. I'm ready. - I don't have time. - Are you going out? - Saturday night is pay day. - Can you take me with you? Sorry kid, I've got a job to finish. Ask Hasard. - Ask me what? - See you, guys. - See you, Rudi. - Where are you going? I'm going to the park, with the Italian. Are you coming? - No thanks. - Your loss. Ciao. I'd take you to see Charlotte at the hospital, but it's not allowed. Kids are allowed out, but not allowed in. Have a good evening. There. They've all left. They left me. For the first time ever, I was alone. Completely alone. Like a wet rag. I felt a kind of… contraction of the solar plexus. The beast was starting to eat away at me from the inside. So, I took everything I could find to feed it. Banana with bread. It's funny, but… I thought I could hear that old song Mom loved so much. Are you Maxime? Yes. I thought you were dead? I'm waiting for your mom. It's crazy how obsessed she is with you. I could have been your dad you know. Really? Do you like cold pasta? Miss Hortense, it's too late. The ship is anchored to a buoy. The bill of lading has been signed It's going to weigh anchor The bill of lading has been signed It's going to weigh anchor Farewell scarf, farewell Madras cotton Farewell fleck of gold and a cute necklace My friend is gone Alas, it's forever. My friend is leaving Alas, it's forever. - Move, for God's sake! - Don't be a pain in the ass! Take the bag! Come on! Hurry up! Oh shut up. You couldn't even open it! Okay, shut up. Move! Oh shit! - The suit was a great idea. I look silly! - Oh, okay, okay! Put it down. One, two… Stop, we're going to get stuck in the mud. Shit! Find a plank, a piece of wood. Anything! Hurry up! Shit! Oh, I've got one. Move it! Get in the car! - Accelerate, come on! - That's all I'm doing! More! Accelerate! God, he's so stupid. Hurry up. Oh! Come on. Calm down. Don't worry, I'll manage. - What the hell are you doing? - Oh, okay! Forget it. We won't manage! - I'll manage. - Yeah, right. Come on. Hurry up. Get the cash out! Pipe down. One… - So? - …two. three, four, five… six gold Louis'. Shit, shit! Your mom must have forgotten to teach you how to count millions. For God's sake! Here's your share. Where are you going? I can drop you off? Hey, put that down. Why did you rat me out to the cops? Rudi, it wasn't me. Don't be an idiot! I know it was you. I've always known. I swear! I couldn't stop thinking about it in jail. Why you? Why did my only friend rat me out? I didn't rat you out! Did you sell me out? Who would I sell you out too? No! You should never have done that, Najim. That's why I did this pathetic job with you. To leave you here after opening the safe. With the cash. Don't kill me! It wasn't me. Ask Aziz, ask Pascal, ask them all! - Don't kill me! - Why shouldn't I kill you? Because you're my only friend. You're a thief, a liar, an informer, but my only friend. Rudi? Rudi! Rudi! Shit… COINCIDENCE Do you wear glasses now? In jail, I read an article that said glasses wearers are more intelligent. So, there. What's this, Marius? I'm the youngest in the family, so I'm the one who's surplus. I therefore decided that I need to leave. Can't you wait a bit? Did you not know they're building an amusement park here? No, I didn't know. Here, read this. We're going to be evicted. So, I'd rather leave. I took the furniture before it all gets destroyed. You could go to boarding school. You could go back to jail. Or we could squeeze up even more. I'm fed up of squeezing up. Plus, we're not alone. There's also all the memories, which take up a lot of room. Oh, you know we can lose memories or erase them. I'm already taking a fair amount with me. I wrote everything down. - Why? - For later. Come here, Pépette. Come here. Did you steal her too? No, she ran away, Family life was draining her. She's an adventurer. Come on! Where are you going? To the moon. Where's there's room. Are you sure of that? There's no one there. I saw it on TV, before I swiped it. - I never would have thought it was you… - Me neither. Here, take this too. You'll need it for the journey. Subtitle translation by: Ginger Clark
