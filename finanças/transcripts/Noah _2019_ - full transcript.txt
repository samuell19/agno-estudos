NARRATOR: In the beginning of time, God created man in His own image. Male and female, He created them. And God placed them in a beautiful garden called Eden. A place to fellowship with God, to live in perfect harmony with each other, and with Him. Then, being tempted by Satan, they disobeyed God... ...and this paradise was lost. The door to Eden was shut! Thus, by one man, sin had entered into the whole world. And it came to pass that the wickedness of man increased and became so great, that every thought and intent o his heart was continually evil. There was no fear of God in him And the Lord God was grieved in his heart that He had made man. But there was one man who pleased God, and found favor in the eyes of the Lord! That man is Noah! What a beautiful morning You have made, Jehovah. I bless Your holy name. ♪ And I will worship You all of my days ♪ What a beautiful morning You have made ♪ The dawning of the day is so peaceful ♪ Just as you are my friend, Karou Yonah, I'm coming. Patience, old girl. ♪ Your food is on the way for you And so is yours, my dear. Look at all these eggs today. Oh, Emuwnah, the Lord's blessings are overwhelming. Abundant food, a beautiful morning. -Hmm. Yes. And a far more beautiful wife. Oh, if you're trying to get an extra portion for breakfast, it's working. BOTH: ♪ What a beautiful morning ♪ You have made, Jehovah ♪ It's wonderful to give You praise Shem, Keturah. ♪ Isn't God good? ALL: ♪ His mercies are new every day ♪ What a beautiful morning He has made I couldn't have said it better. - JAPHETH: Good morning, Father. - Oh, Japheth, Kayla. Already hard at work, I see. -JAPHETH: We like to get an early start. -At least, Japheth does. -NOAH: Have you seen Ham? -No. Who knows what he's doing. HAM: Not again. - Good morning, Father! - Good morning, Ham. JAPHETH: Ham, just grab him. Great idea, Japheth, I hadn't thought of that. JAPHETH: I'll get him. Come on! Now this is going to be interesting. Oh, I don't know who's more stubborn. Ham, Japheth, or the goat. Well, you're right about that, Aurelle. - MELECH: Hey! - Hello, Noah. - NOAH: Melech. My brother, good morning. How good to see you. Oh, it's been such a long time. Oh, I have been so occupied with all that's going on in the city. You know, world-changing events are happening. - It's incredible. - Oh, I see. I would love to talk with you about it, Noah, but I can't stay today. I just came to give Japheth some iron ore for that new plow he's designing, huh. Oh, iron's expensive. That's very generous of you, brother. We're family. - We need to support each other. - Right? -Yes. -Melech, what a wonderful surprise. -MELECH: Emuwnah. Ah! Oh, it's so good to see you. You're just in time for breakfast. Oh, I'm sorry, Emuwnah, but I've got an important meeting in Nod. - But next time. - Oh. All right. But we miss seeing you, Melech. You're a gift from the Lord to us, and we love you. - And I love you, Emuwnah. - Oh, I hope so. After 300 years of marriage, you're stuck with me now. Oh, I wouldn't have it any other way. BOTH: ♪ What a beautiful morning ♪ You have made, Jehovah ♪ We can face our future unafraid ♪ You shower us with love With blessings from above ♪ What a beautiful morning ♪ You have made ♪ What a beautiful day ♪ HAM: Uncle Melech, you're here. MELECH: Uh... And you caught the goat. MELECH: Well, it's the law of nature, Ham. You know, animals or humans, it's all the same. Give them what they want, you'll have them eating out of your hands. - It's good to see you. -Oh, don't leave. You just got here. Well, I have to. Oh, and, Japheth, something in the barn for you. Oh, my iron ore. Thank you, Uncle Melech. Ham, come on, you can help me. - Really? - JAPHETH: Let's go. Thanks, Japheth. NOAH: The Lord bless you, Brother. Never forget how much He loves you. Yep, I will get this family caught up with the rest of the world yet, Noah. - KAYLA: Bye, Uncle Melech. - Bye, Melech. NOAH: Shalom! KAYLA: Bye. We love you. EMUWNAH: Now, Noah, breakfast will be ready soon. Don't get distracted milking Yonah. - Not today. I'm hungry. - EMUWNAH: Right. NOAH: Good morning. Thank you. - AURELLE: Morning, Daddy. - Morning, Aurelle. All right, Yonah. We better get busy, hmm? Oh, Yonah. God is so good. Hmm. Now, calm down. I'm warming my hands. I didn't forget. All right. Here we go again. - MAN: Noah. - Yes? Hmm? Emuwnah. - Yes? - Emuwnah, are you calling me? No, dear. Huh. MAN: Noah. Yonah, do you hear someone calling me? That's what I thought. Well... A little taste won't hurt. Mmm. The good stuff. MAN: Noah. God. My God, Jehovah, is it you? JEHOVAH: Noah, don't be afraid. It is you. You have found favor in my sight. You've given your heart to me. Now, I will share mine with you The Earth is filled with violence and corruption. Mankind has turned his back on me and refuses to return. My heart is grieved, for now, I must judge those whom I've created. Noah, water will rain down from the sky. I will cover the Earth with a great flood, destroying every living being. A flood? Covering every living being? Everything in which there is breath of life, will die. But I have found you to be righteous. I will protect you. Noah, you must build an ark. - An ark? - Yes. You and your family will enter it and be saved. You must bring two of every animal, bird and reptile, male and female, into the ark with you. Oh. But, Lord, how shall I build it? You shall build it out of gopher wood. It shall have one door and many rooms inside. Make it 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high. Yes, Lord. I see. Now, go, and don't be afraid, for I, the Lord, your God, am with you. Oh, my Lord and my God, with all my heart I give You praise. Who am I to receive so great a gift? The ark, a promise from you whereby we shall be saved. Thank you, for having mercy upon me and my family this day. Thank you for remembering us. Let it be done according to your word. Oh, mighty God, I worship you. But where do I begin? Yonah, where do I build an ark, 450 feet long, and 45 feet... Whoa! Oh! What will Emuwnah say about this? Where will I put it? Why not right there, by the house. Yes. Yes. What did He say? Seventy-five feet wide. Well, that's... That's right in the middle of Emuwnah's vegetable garden. I better put it back here. Four hundred and fifty feet. That's, uh, three, six, nine... Noah? Aren't you done milking Yonah? Your breakfast is getting cold. Twelve, 15, 18... Noah, what are you doing? - Emuwnah? - What? I think my morning meal will have to wait. - You're not going to eat? What? - Oh, no, no, no, no. Noah, are you feeling... -Emuwnah! - What? - Call the girls. - Now? - Boys! - Shem! Ham! Japheth! - Girls, come. - Come quickly, girls. - Everyone, come. Hurry! - AURELLE: What's happening? - Father, what is it? - EMUWNAH: I don't know. - My family. EMUWNAH: What is it? NOAH: The Lord God Jehovah has spoken to me. - Spoke to you? How? - Yes. Why, I heard His voice with my ears. Oh, but also in my heart. - AURELLE: Oh. - What did He say? Well, He said, all creation has rejected Him. Mankind refuses to turn from his wicked ways. Now, the long-suffering patience of the Lord has finally ended. And all living things must be destroyed. Oh, my Lord. How can this be? All living things will be destroyed? Yes. When will this happen? Well, He did not tell me when, but judgment will be poured out - with a flood. - Flood? What do you mean? Water will cover the Earth. It will rain down from the sky. But that's never happened before. This world is ending. We will see many things we've never seen before. SHEM: I just can't believe this. I thought we'd have children and all grow old together. I can't believe our lives would end this way. Oh, my precious family, our lives will not end this way. The Lord has promised to save us. - EMUWNAH: What? - How? Well, He told me to build an ark. HAM: A what? An ark. It's a large house. A very large house with many floors and rooms that will float on top of the water. And we will all live in it. - We're going to live in it? - NOAH: Yes! Oh! And we are to bring along two of every kind of animal, bird and reptile. Well, that's what He said. We do believe you, Father. It's just difficult to understand. NOAH: Yes. But we are the only ones? No one else will be saved? Only those found in the ark of safety will be saved. How do we even begin something like this? Well, we should begin on our knees. And seek the Lord for His wisdom. He is faithful. And with Him, all things are possible. He will reveal and provide what we need as we need it. My heart already breaks for all those who will be lost. And I can't believe the grace the Lord has shown us. I just can't take it all in. Lord, we worship You, and we give You honor and praise. NARRATOR: From the day God commissioned Noah, Noah and his sons acted upon th word which God had spoken, praying, planning, and designing the ark with parchment, charcoal, clay and wood, modeling it according to God's direction. Day after day, God's wisdom was imparted to Noah and his three sons. Father, now, these were some of the first plans that we drew. Now, this was Shem's favorite. Ham liked this one. But, this is the one that I think is best. Well, the Lord gave us the dimensions, but He left the design up to us. You know, it's also good we're using gopher wood. I mean, oak is too heavy and will make us sink. Ugh. It's the size and shape of the boat that makes it float, Ham, not the kind of wood that's used. -All right, Japheth. You don't even know how to swim. Why would I even need to know... -Boys! I'm just estimating the amount of resources we'll need to build this. I don't know how we're gonna do it. We've never even been on a boat. - So what if... - All right, we get it... Boys! We can't try to figure this out on our own. Everything about this ark demands faith. Each day, we will seek the Lord and He will show us what to do. Well, tomorrow may be our first trip to the city of Nod, but it won't be our last. I never thought I would go there. But it's the only way to get the supplies we need. - Look at this. - It's gonna take years to build. We'll be old men before we're done. What's the matter with being an old man? - SHEM: Hey. - Grandfather Methuselah. Boys, I'm over 800 years old. At my age, I've seen it all, heard it all, done it all. I just can't remember it all. - HAM: Hey, Uncle Melech. - Hello, Ham. And don't let him fool you, boys. He remembers everything, huh? Oh. I like your father's plan to build a huge boat with animals on it. Well, Melech, I know this is difficult for you to understand. It's difficult for any thinking person to understand. Brother, we grew up in the same family together. You know the ways of the Lord, and that His ways are not our ways. But His ways don't work anymore. - Now, Melech, you... - I'm sorry, Grandfather. But look, the world is changing. If you don't change with it, you're gonna be left behind. So, tell me why I need this change. Because... From every nation, the world is coming together as one. United for one purpose, under one leader. Now, the power in that, it's unlimited. And, out of all of the people, Lahab has made me governor of this province. HAM: That's great. But he's an ungodly man, Melech. He's a visionary, who looks forward, not back. I can see this is an honor for you, Melech. But we serve the Lord, not this Lahab. Well, that's where you need to change your thinking, huh? You can do both. But for now, stay away from the city of Nod. Uh... We're going there tomorrow. -What? No. We have to. We can't start building until we get supplies from the city. Building? - Noah, why are you doing this? - Because this world is ending, Melech. Noah, I brought the sacks of sea grain you requested. Oh, Azar, excellent! Thank you, my friend. No. Thank you. You've spent more on seeds for planning than I've earned in two years. We need to begin storing up large amounts of grain. I can't believe he's doing this. Noah, now I'm just curious, what would it cost to get a ride on that boat? Oh, no cost at all. We would love to have you come along. Hmm? No, you don't want me. Azar, the Lord desires to save you, not destroy you. He's ready to forgive if you're willing to believe. Well, not now, Noah, I have so much work to do. Maybe later. I'm just too busy. Too busy to save your life? AZAR: Some other time, Noah, but not today. All right. But if you change your mind, come, we'll talk. Anytime. Day or night. Noah, have you gone mad? You know, if you continue to pursue this delusion, do you realize where this is going to end? Judgment is coming, Melech. - People need to know. - Do not go to the city. I have to. I have no choice. Then you go at your own risk. I cannot protect you there. You may be able to persuade an ignorant country peasant like Azar, but you breathe a word of this in Nod... -Melech, I'm not... It will not be tolerated. - Do you understand? - I understand you, Brother! I wish you understood me. Good night, Grandfather. Oh! I get so upset when I talk with him. Yeah, because you're a lot alike. You're both passionate about what you believe. But I want him to believe the truth. I'm sure he's thinking the same thing about us. Well, we better get on with our planning. Now, Japheth, what's that at the top of the ark? - Oh, it's a sail. - Oh! That's what that is. I don't know. Do you think we need it? Well, I think that the Lord will guide the ark. But I do think you need more vents. -Why? Well, all those animals will eat all that food, and then... Forget the sails. We need more vents. -Right. ♪ We will create a brand-new gate ♪ A greater world, a greater race ♪ There is a better way ♪ A greater future to embrace ♪ We answer to no god ♪ All that we need is in us ♪ Speak to us, bring the harp ♪ The future's here ♪ Before us ♪ Descendants of Cain, we are one people, free to live as we choose. Together, there is nothing we cannot do. Seven generations ago, the first human was born. Cain was judged and rejected by Jehovah. - But Cain did not quit. - ALL: No. When he was kicked aside, - he kicked back. - ALL: Yes! And the spirit of Cain has survived and thrived, and now, we dominate the Earth. ALL: Yes! To enforce and advance our way of life, I have elected three governors. Zealous, ruthless men. -Herod, the Governor of Euphrates. -All that we need is within us. We will bow to no god. ALL: Yes! Yes! Jubal, the Governor of Sumar. There is no right or wrong. We are free to live as our hearts desire. ALL: Yes! And Melech, the newly appointed Governor of Zekorah. With Lahab as our leader, we are creating a new world. Together, there is nothing we cannot do. ALL: Yes! We are the children of Cain. ALL: And together, there is nothing we cannot do! -Sir, we don't want to cause any trouble. -It's too late for that. Please, allow us to leave now. Not without Governor Melech's permission. Forgive me, Governor Melech, but those men over there were causing trouble in the market this morning and claim to be part of your family. - What? Oh, no. I'll handle this. -Yes, Governor. Noah, I can't believe this. I told you to stay away from here, but you never listen to anyone. Uncle Melech, the merchants would not sell us supplies until we told them why we needed them. So you told them the truth? Well, we couldn't lie. Noah, why would you say you knew me? - He didn't. - What? I did. I thought it would help. Just go home, all right? Quickly. I'll cover it up somehow. - Go. - Melech, wait. Don't send your family away. I want all of us to meet them. That won't be necessary, Lahab, they're leaving, now. Ladies, escort our guests to the platform. WOMAN: Yes, Lahab. LAHAB: Melech, you've been deceptive. That wasn't my intention. Did you tell me your brother was not one of us? - No. - I am a very vengeful man. Don't ever deceive me. People of Nod, come, meet Governor Melech's family. - You're Melech's brother? - Yes, I am Noah, and these are my sons. Welcome to Nod. You've purchased an extraordinary amount of supplies. Melech, why does your brother need all of these provisions? Uh... For a building project. What is he building? He told me he's building an enormous boat. - A ship. - LAHAB: A boat? So big, everyone in Nod could fit in it. Why would he build a boat hundreds of miles from the sea? He said the world was coming to an end. My brother is a farmer. He's from the country. He has very different ideas. I think... -I think he needs to explain himself. -LAHAB: Yes. JUBAL: What did you mean when you said "the world coming to an end," Noah? A flood of judgment is coming that will destroy all flesh upon the Earth. It will be poured out from heaven with water from the sky. Water from the sky, that's impossible. Water comes from the ground, not the sky. Where did you get these ideas, Noah? The Lord God, Jehovah, spoke to me. JUBAL: "He spoke." HEROD: Melech! As Governor, I assumed you'd have the total support of your family. And certainly not a brother who honors Jehovah. And who speaks such condemning words. - Yes, Noah, what did you mean by saying, "Judgement's coming upon us"? Like your ancestor, Cain, you have rejected Jehovah as your God. For hundreds of years, He has been merciful and patient. But you have purposely removed Him from your lives. Without Him, every thought and desire of your heart is corrupted. Your godlessness has polluted the Earth and now it must be cleansed. You speak words of treason. I am speaking words of truth! But even now it is not too late - to escape judgment. - Father. The door of the ark is still open to you. If you will just confess Jehovah is God and commit your life to worship Him, He will... If you enter that ark... -Enough! Lahab, fellow Governors, people of Nod, I am sickened by the behavior of this man today. And I do not share in his judgmental, intolerant beliefs. And as of this day, I will ensure that he never enters this city again. Noah, you and your sons are banished from this place forever. Leave immediately. - Let's just go. - Father. HAM: Excuse me. MELECH: Go ahead without your supplies. - What? - But they're ours, we paid for them. You lost that privilege. - Go. - WOMAN: Get out. MAN: Get out! MAN: Hey! WOMAN: Melech! Today, you have witnessed the fear and danger a worshiper of Jehovah brings. And also, the passion your Governor Melech had - for defending you. - ALL: Yes! LAHAB: Melech, your brother's supplies belong to you now. No. No, they... They belong to the people of Nod. It's all yours. Please, please. I hope you've learned that I demand absolute loyalty. Yes, Lahab. There can be no compromise between those who follow the God of Adam, and those who do not. Governors, when we as a people are united, there is nothing we cannot do. Come, it is time to create a new world. KAYLA: Hurry up. Keturah, we found so many wreaths for making baskets. We will fill that ark with them. How's it going? Did you finish one yet? It's awful. It's... Uh... Well, it's... BOTH: It's horrible! I have been so frustrated. I asked Shem to buy me some baskets from Nod, just so I could see how they do it. You did? Yes. I know Father doesn't like that but, well, look at this. Did you ask Shem to get you anything else? Like what? Like, some of the special perfume they make there. Why? Because I might have asked Ham to get some for me. You did? - So did I. - What? Well, not the perfume, but I did ask Japheth to bring me back some of the purple cloth they have there. I just love it! - Really? - Oh, yes, Keturah, we're admitting it. We're not as righteous as you. Well, neither am I. Because I asked Shem to buy me some sandals! - Keturah! - Can I borrow them? SHARON: Mmm. Emuwnah, you still make the best sweet cakes in the land. Oh, well, if I remember, it was your recipe to begin with. Oh. That was so long ago. - We are getting old. - No, we're not. We're middle-aged. We're only in our 430s. Well, I'm glad to see that after all of these years Noah is finally going to the city of Nod. Only because he has to. Emuwnah, why are you so afraid of progress? - Change is good. - Not all change is good. And it's not progress I fear, it's godlessness. People everywhere have completely removed the Lord from their lives. And that change is dangerous, and heartbreaking. I'm sorry. I know better than to talk about this with you. Oh, Sharon. METHUSELAH: From a distance, I thought I was seeing three angels. Now I know I am. WOMEN: Great -Grandfather Methuselah. Mother, Father, it's so good to see you. I wasn't expecting you. Come inside for something to eat and drink. No, no. We're on our way home from Nod. We just wanted to see you for a moment, Kayla. Oh. All right. Now, I have with me all of our family history since the time of Adam. And the most recent plans for the ark. That's what I wanna see. -I know. I wish you could stay and spend some time getting to know everyone. You always come and go so quickly. Well, we'll be spending plenty of time here now. Noah's asked us to work for him building his boat. He did? And you will? I will milk him for as much money as he wants to give me. Papa, but... Would you consider coming on the ark with us? That's the kind of talk that makes me... -Nablah. Kayla, your father and I have put up with your marriage to Japheth and his family. But now with this ark... You need to be prepared to come back home. What? No. Can't you see? They are turning you into one of them! And what's wrong with that? Noah and his family are the kindest, most generous, godly people I've ever met. I want to be like that. So you want to do this to your mother? - She cries like this for you, every night. Mama... Your mother's had enough heartache for today. I need to get her home now. Nablah, Tamara, wait. - I'll walk home with you. - No, Sharon, wait. Please, don't leave like this. What do you want me to do? You tell me that your God is sending a flood to destroy everyone, except you and your family. You'll be safe inside your big boat. Sharon. I don't even know what to say to you anymore, Emuwnah. I'm sorry I showed Sharon the plans for the ark, Mama. Oh, I'm glad you did, Aurelle. I've been praying for an opportunity to speak with her about it. She didn't receive it well. Neither did my parents. - Oh, Kayla. - I know. My dear women, now, I have spoken with Adam, Seth and Enoch. You have the same love for people as they did. You want to bring others into the ark, more than you want to build it for yourselves. Many friends and members of our own families will be lost. - Yes. - This is just the beginning. KETURAH: Is that the men? Where's the wagon? - Something's wrong. - EMUWNAH: Noah, what's happened? All the supplies we bought, our wagon, everything was taken from us in Nod. What? Why? It's much worse there than we thought. They hate Jehovah and everyone who serves Him. But not Uncle Melech. I know his beliefs are changing, but he wouldn't support that. Would he? I've lost him, Emuwnah. I've lost my own brother. Noah, did the two of you have words? HAM: No, Mother. Father did everything he could to protect Uncle Melech. Ham was the one who got us into trouble. Oh, Ham. SHEM: I wish you could've seen Father today. He stood there in front of Lahab, the governors, the whole city, and with respect and compassion, he boldly spoke the truth. Thank you, Shem. But I feel like I've only made things worse. I know destruction is coming. But every time I try to tell people, no one believes me. Not even my own brother. EMUWNAH: Oh, you dear man. The Lord was offering salvation to all of those people through you. Well, it's going to be the last time, 'cause now we're banned from ever going into the city again. - What? - JAPHETH: We can't go. We can't get supplies. So, now, we can't build the ark. SHEM: We're sunk. Um... Well, I've been looking at these plans, and you call for iron nails, bulwarks and huge amounts of rope. Exactly. That's what we can't get. Well, we could use wooden pegs for nails, logs soaked in tar for bulwarks, and we could make rope from those fields of hemp in the valley. Yes! You and Ham can turn out pegs. Keturah, you and Shem could braid the rope. Kayla, you and Japheth could make vats. KETURAH: Yes! And don't forget, Father already asked some of our kinsmen to help too. We'll ask all of them to help, and anyone else who's willing. They can build the animal cages, cut lumber, boil pitch. Well, since you have all of this figured out, what would you like for us to do? You boys can go make dinner. We have a meal prepared for you. We're going to help you build it, Noah. Just as the Lord gave it to you. And we'll pray, and bring as many people along as we can. Maybe even your brother. Thank you, Emuwnah. I love each one of you so much. Oh, what a day. Come, let's go build an ark. KETURAH: All right. NARRATOR: Noah was encouraged to see his family rally together, putting many hands to the task. After a long period of preparation, the first tree was felled, and the first pieces of timber were brought to the site. The sounds of mallets and saws echoed into days, months and years, as the skeleton of this huge ship began to take on the likeness of a large, floating vessel. Five years, 15 years, 30 years, 50 years. After 75 years, the exterior of the ark was nearing its completion. NOAH: Now get on the other side. There you are! Get up there.

There's plenty of food for everyone, but let's take a moment and give thanks before we start shoveling it in. - Noah. - Yeah. I would just like to ask again today, is there anyone who would want to come along with us on the ark? Now, don't be afraid. - Let's just eat. - ALL: Yes! All right then. Let's pray. Lord, we give You thanks, for Your goodness and Your provision. Bless this food and these people as they work together to fulfill Your purpose. Save them from the coming destruction. Have mercy on them, Lord. Ow! AZAR: Noah. Hey, Noah, can I have a word with you? Certainly, Azar. What's on your mind? Well, I hear everyone saying, "Peace and safety, we're on our way to a better world." - Ah, yes. - Everyone except you. You see something different coming. Well, whatever happens, I'd like to go along with you on that ship, Noah. - You do? - Yes, I do. Whatever's coming, I want to escape it. You want to put your trust in Jehovah. No. I don't really trust in your God. But I don't trust where the world's going either. What are you saying, Azar? I'm saying... Noah, you're a good man. I like you. I just don't wanna live like you. I don't wanna have to change the way I live and give up everything I enjoy. I just wanna be on that boat when the time comes. Azar, Jehovah loves you, and He wants you to love Him. Oh, I'm not talking about loving. I'm talking about surviving. I'm sorry, Azar, you cannot have it both ways. It's heartbreaking. Yes. Noah, I'm concerned about something else with the workers. Now, every day, more and more supplies are disappearing. - They're stealing from you. - I know. Well, shouldn't we put a stop to it? Oh, the Lord blesses the just and the unjust. Perhaps kindness will lead them to repentance. Melech. My brother, what a wonderful surprise. It's been years. - Grandfather. - Yes? You need to leave here immediately. Couldn't we at least say hello, before we say goodbye? MELECH: There's no time for foolishness! Trouble is coming. METHUSELAH: Oh! Well, I don't like trouble. But I'm not afraid of it either. My place is here with the family! I still consider you part of that family, Melech. Stubborn old man. I'm done with him. LAHAB: Well, well, well, here it is. Huh. This is more impressive than I had imagined. Well done, Noah. It is extraordinary, that an uneducated farmer like yourself could accomplish all of this. But I suppose, with the right kind of hired help... Gomer. I wondered why I hadn't seen you much in your masonry shop. And Micah. Well, I'm sure your carpentry skills came in very handy out here. And Governor Melech, look, there's Abner. I guess repairing wagon wheels in Nod is not as lucrative as building animal cages for the ark. Yes, surprisingly good work here. It is a shame you all have to suffer because of it. MAN 1: What? MAN 2: What do you mean? LAHAB: Governor Melech? Noah, when I banished you from the city, I clearly said you can no longer use any supplies or resources from Nod. I haven't. Everything I've used to build the ark has come from my own land. Really? Even all of these people? What? What are you saying? Well, the greatest resource of Nod is its people. You've stolen them, Noah, and defied the law of the land. You have defied the law of God! And that defiance is bringing destruction. The only thing that's going to be destroyed is that ridiculous boat! - The boat is for Jehovah. Ham. - All right! Enough words! It's hot out here. This work should never have been allowed to go on. Everyone involved should suffer serious consequences. However, unlike Noah's God, I am a merciful man. If you return home now, you can continue to live as citizens of the world with all of its privileges, safe from harm. However, if you continue to work for this man, you will be banned from Nod forever, an enemy without provision or protection. It's your choice. All I can offer you is an open door into this ark. But in it you will be saved when the waters rise. LAHAB: Enough. Melech, draw a line. WOMAN 1: Why? WOMAN 2: I don't know. LAHAB: Now, you choose. I know most of you work here for the money. But I also know that you're here, because maybe, just maybe, what my husband has said is true. Your lives depend on this choice. I wish I could stop you from leaving, but you must believe.

And in your hour of despair, you'll come begging at my door. No, Lahab, the day will come when you will beg to enter through this door. Yeah. I've exposed you for who you are, and now you're completely alone. But this matter is not over. You'll see me again. No one can understand why you don't give up this crazy idea. But I know. You could never admit when you were wrong. Ever. This is not Noah's idea, Melech, this is God's. Now you are fighting against Him. You don't destroy this thing, I will. - No. Melech. - Come on. Melech. Melech. - We must keep holding on... - Yeah. ...to what God has promised. He has given us this ark. And He is faithful to save. This season of testing, difficult as it is, will pass. I was just thinking, when my father gave me my name, he prophesied, "When he is dead, it shall be sent." Over 800 years, I never knew what that meant until the Lord spoke to your father. Jehovah has suffered a long time over the sins of this world. And there are times when He asks those who love Him to suffer with Him. NOAH: Thank you, Grandfather. Thank you. Come, it's late. Let us take our rest. KETURAH: Shem, are you coming in? I'll be in shortly. It's okay. Oh, dear Lord, I cannot believe what is happening. Abner. Azar. Kayla's parents. They've all turned from You. And Uncle Melech is doing everything he can to stop us. Why, Lord? Why will they not believe Your words? Can all this really be? Is everyone wrong, and we're the only ones right?

All right. - What do we do? - MAN: Keep going. NOAH: What's going on? Melech, what are you doing? MELECH: And now we'll see if your God will save you. - Boys, they're burning... - Oh, shut your mouth. Get him in the ark! Tie him up, make sure he can't get out. MAN: Get up there. Move it, old man! HAM: Father? What's going on? Fire! No! - Fire! The ark's on fire! - Quiet, you annoying little fool. This is what happens when you serve Jehovah. Shem, take Keturah! The ark! Get up! MELECH: No! The heat is on. Get out of here. JAPHETH: Shem, the ark's on fire. HAM: Uncle Melech. SHEM: Ham, are you all right? Father is in the ark. - What? - No. Ham, I need your help! EMUWNAH: Water! JAPHETH: Father! We need your help! EMUWNAH: Noah! NOAH: Hurry! JAPHETH: I'm coming! I'm coming! SHEM: Need water, quick, quick. SHEM: Japheth, Japheth, we need you in here. SHEM: It's gone to the second floor! NARRATOR: After more than 120 years, the ark was finally complete. KAYLA: Pass me another stack of dishes, please. AURELLE: I need a crate for the beans. KETURAH: It looks like we're going to need a few more baskets for the rest of those raisins. Oh, baskets. Think how many baskets we have made. Remember that first "basket" you made, Keturah. That wasn't a basket. It was a catastrophe. ♪ Making baskets Plain and fancy, big and small How many baskets have we made? ♪ Thousands, thousands, short and tall ♪ Every basket Specially made by caring hands ♪ It's our task, it's in Jehovah's plan ♪ We make baskets for this -Beans and peas and raisins, too. -KETURAH: Mmm-hmm. ♪ Baskets for that Dishes, spoons, shirts and food. ♪ Oh, this one's so lovely Yes, it is.

And do a good job this time. Ladies, we're gonna need more baskets. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. SHEM: It's so good hearing you laugh again. KETURAH: He said baskets. SHEM: It been a difficult few days for all of us. Oh, I still can't believe Grandfather Methuselah is gone. I miss his laugh. How he always used to make me laugh. And how every time he talked about the Lord, he would start to cry. I loved that old man. - JAPHETH: Thanks, Shem. - Shem. - Girls, what's wrong? - Just thinking of Grandfather. He was right. He knew. His death was a sign the rains would come. - What do you mean? - The Lord has spoken to your father. In seven days, the rains will begin. - Seven days? We're not ready. - No, we're ready. The Lord has provided everything we need. This is what we've been working for. -I know, it's just... I'm not sure I'm ready. HAM: Why? Just hard to imagine that in a week, all of this will be gone. Everything we've known. Everyone we've known. Since the Lord first spoke to me, every day I wake up with great hope and equally, great sorrow, and at any moment I can be consumed by either one. It's always been something in the future. Now, it's here. Animals. Oh, my goodness, we forgot about the animals. How are we supposed to gather two of every kind of animal, bird and reptile -in seven days? It's impossible. What? -Turn around. Oh, my. EMUWNAH: My dear, with God, nothing is impossible. He's bringing the animals to us. It's happening. It's all really happening, just like He said. What are they? I've never seen that kind before. SHEM: Uh, we can look in the book of records from Adam that Grandfather gave us. EMUWNAH: Be careful, Noah. They could be dangerous. I don't think so. Come. I won't hurt you. Oh! Oh! I could see it in your eyes. - AURELLE: Oh, my goodness. - You belong to Him. - Keturah, are you all right? - Yes. It's just that it's been so hard. All these years of persecution and sacrifice, and then, to see these animals coming to us tonight. It's all been worth it. Oh. There is no one like Jehovah. And it is an honor to serve Him. Yes. Tonight is a night to remember all the good things Jehovah has done. And to give Him thanks. ♪ Hallelujah ♪ Hallelujah ♪ We will praise you ♪ Jehovah ♪ Hallelujah ♪ Hallelujah ♪ We will praise you ♪ Jehovah ♪ Hallelujah ♪ Hallelujah ♪ You are forever faithful ♪ Hey! Well... EMUWNAH: And that's where I got you. All right. Come. Bring them together. NOAH: Thanks be to Jehovah-God. What a beautiful ending! Oh! So many kinds. Well, this seems to be the last of them, Father. Finally, all the animals are almost loaded. Only Jehovah could accomplish all of this. Oh, look, Noah, someone almost got left behind. NOAH: Oh, Abby! Well, the animals are almost loaded. Let's load the last of the supplies. Praise be to Jehovah-God! His blessings are never ending. He is the true God above all Gods. And His love and mercy endureth forever! And forever! NARRATOR: The ark was now completed. The supplies and animals were all loaded. The ark was now ready to fulfill its purpose. Throughout the long hours of that final night, Noah, unable to sleep, arose from his rest to walk through the huge ark one final time. Walking in through the door, he realized this was the only passageway by which one could enter and be saved. Turning to his right and then to his left, Noah looked up into the rafters then went down to the first level. He remembered how God had made known to him the size of this huge vessel. He placed his torch to the sacred alter, which illuminated the inside of the great ark. He marveled how God brought all these animals to him, how every cage had been filled. There was no empty space. Yet no cage was too full. It was so quiet and peaceful. Even now, each animal was under the control of its creator. So many animals, yet so peaceful. NARRATOR: From cage to cage, he observed the peace and calm of each animal. So many sizes, shapes and kinds, he cried out in praise. What a creative God! Holy is Your name! As he walked on the second level, the years of time filled his mind. Over 100 years of building each level, each cage. Remembering it all so well. And the friends who helped him through the years. But where are they tonight? He looked at the large storage rooms of crates, baskets and supplies, and was reminded of the ladies toiling faithfully, preparing for this day. Climbing to the third level, moving higher and higher in body and in spirit, he was amazed at what he and hi family had accomplished with th help of God. Every living creature aboard reminded him of salvation. Even the mighty king of all beasts with such strength and beauty, now so peaceful. Still upward, to the highest area, the greens, the vegetation, the fruit. Oh. Plums. My favorite fruit. Mmm! Oh. I must have a touch of honey. Mmm. So sweet. Forty-five feet high... Yes, tonight it is a reality. Oh. Karou. I see you've found a new home as well. Shalom. NARRATOR: Down, down, down, into the family living space he traveled... NOAH: Ooh. ...to a large room beautifully and warmly decorated by Emuwnah Thank you for my wife, Lord. We will have many precious times of sharing and eating together. NARRATOR: As he walked, he wondered... How long will this journey be? How strange. The Lord never mentioned it even once. In the sleeping area, it was obvious that the women had been working on the placement of clothes and belongings. A note hanging by his cot read... EMUWNAH: "My dear Noah, in my heart, I knew you would be here tonight", "to make one final journey through this great ark. "Remembering one last time, all that had happened through the many long years. "The world that we have known is soon going to end. "I have wondered within myself many times "where we will be going and how much time it will take until we get there. "But, wherever, and whenever it is, "I thank my God that I am going there with you." "I love you, and always will. Emuwnah." And I will always love you too, Emuwnah. Lord, thank you for my wife. I couldn't have done any of this without her. And she would agree. Well, this is the seventh day. But today is no different than any other day. The morning sun so beautiful. So quiet and peaceful. What's that sound? Emuwnah, come quickly! Emuwnah! Noah, I brought the sacred writings passed down from Adam. They need to be put in a safe place. -Yes. Indeed. I have the children gathering the rest of our things - from the house. - Emuwnah! - What? - Listen! What? Good heavens, what is that? It is the sound of the coming rain. Noah, it's happening. It's really happening. Oh, Emuwnah, even now, this close to the end, - the Lord is still warning. - Yes. Still giving people a chance to turn to Him before the rains come. I need to get the children inside. -Hmm. And I will find a safe place for these scrolls. - Lahab. - Hello, Noah. This is unbelievable. I congratulate you. NOAH: Don't worry about that now. Just get inside. SHEM: Father, there's people gathering outside. Whoa! - Lahab. - Father, are you all right? He's fine. He's safe with me. But from the sound of that crowd outside, it's not me you should be concerned about. SHEM: We need to get the rest of the family inside and shut the door - before something happens. - NOAH: Japheth. He's right. Time is running out. May I say, you surprise me, Noah. I didn't think you could do it. But you are so much better than that worthless brother of yours. Noah, I've been thinking. What if we work together? Imagine all of my power and your wisdom. You could take Melech's place as Lord Governor. Noah, you will rule the world with me. You can have this world, Lahab. Now get out of here! LAHAB: People of Nod, I have tried to reason with them but they refuse to see the light. We have no choice but to illuminate them. Take one last look at the world, Noah. You'll never see it again. TAMARA: Kayla! Kayla! Kayla, please, don't shut yourself in with them. Come with us. Mother, you know I can't do that. This is where I belong. Listen to me. They are planning to... If you don't come with me now... Tamara, leave her alone. She has made her choice. She's my little girl, Nablah, and I will not leave her behind. - Kayla, please, I'm begging you. - And I'm begging you. Stay with us. It's the only way you can be saved. NABLAH: Never! Do you hear me, never! TAMARA: No! Noah, I will never forgive you for destroying my family. - MELECH: Get up there. - Uncle Melech, just let me go. - AURELLE: Uncle, no. - Melech. - What are you doing? - What I should've done a long time ago. Melech, what has happened to you? I don't even know who you are anymore. There's no room in this world for your kind. NOAH: Please. Please, Brother, do not be deceived. - It's all a lie. - EMUWNAH: All of it. - NOAH: Lahab despises you. - Lahab honors and trusts me. Now you're the liar. Intolerant, judgmental, never admitting you're wrong. Yeah, but now, your God, Jehovah, will be completely removed from this world. It's over, Noah. You lose, I win. This ark of safety will become your grave! SHEM: Uncle Melech shut the door. -No. HAM: He's trapped us inside. AURELLE: What? NOAH: No. Jehovah closed the door. The season of mercy is over. The time for judgement has come. AURELLE: What's that sound? EMUWNAH: Rain. It's beginning to rain. JAPHETH: Ham, where are you going? HAM: To the window. LAHAB: Light all the hay wagons around the ark. I want every inch of it burned. Oh, Noah, they're going to burn the ark. LAHAB: Governor Melech, why is the sky so dark? MELECH: Let's get the fire started, before they try to escape. Father, we're trapped. What are we going to do? We must keep holding on to what God has promised. He has always been faithful. MAN 1: Do you feel that? MAN 2: The water is falling from the sky. MAN 1: Impossible! MAN 2: But what if the old man was right? What if a flood is coming? We're doomed. Where's Lahab? Lahab! MAN 1: Just get the fire started and we can get out of here. MAN 2: We can't. Every time we try to light it, the water from the sky puts it out. MAN 3: Look at that, springs of water are bursting up out of the ground. This is unbelievable. Water is pouring out of the sky. - It's pouring! - I don't want to listen to this. -EMUWNAH: Noah, can't we do something? -We've done everything we can. I don't think I can bear this. NOAH: Away from the door. To the altar. Everybody. MELECH: How do I get this hay wagon on fire? MAN: Oh, Governor Melech, there is no time for that. Do you want to die or run for cover? MELECH: Where's Lahab? We need Lahab! He can protect us! AZAR: Noah! EMUWNAH: Oh, no, it's Azar! AZAR: Noah, you were right. Let me in! Azar, I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. AZAR: Just open the door! NOAH: I can't. It's too late. AZAR: I told you I wanted to come along. I helped you build this boat! Please, let me in. It's too late. It's too late. - TAMARA: Kayla! Kayla! - Mother! Kayla, please, can you hear me? - Open the doors! - Mother! I can't swim! She can't swim. I have to do something. Japheth, I have to help her, please! Anything. I'm so sorry. You can't even see the ground anymore. Water's gushing from everywhere. People are clinging to rocks and trees. -Ham! Shut the window and get down here! This is worse than I ever imagined. MELECH: Oh! Noah! NOAH: Melech! - Brother! - NOAH: Melech! MELECH: Noah, you proved it to everyone. And especially me. You were right, Noah. Enjoy it. You won! No, so much is lost! Melech, my brother! MELECH: The water is rising! MAN: Noah! WOMAN: I can't! I can't hold on any longer! LAHAB: Noah, help me. It's Lahab, I beg you, please let me in. My kingdom is yours. I'll follow you! I'll do anything you say! No! Listen. Listen. Do you hear that? - What's that sound? - AURELLE: What's happening? The ark. It's... It's breaking apart. NOAH: No. AURELLE: No. No. NOAH: Wait. No. JAPHETH: It's lifting off from the earth. - AURELLE: Look out. We're on top of the water! The ark holds! It withstands the raging floods. The ark will carry us. Father, the Lord has saved us. Judgement has come. It is done. NARRATOR: While Noah and his family were safe inside the ark, the world as they knew it perished under the water. The rains continued to pour dow upon the Earth. The dark clouds boiled across the sky, and the fountains of the deep raged beneath it. Suddenly, this huge ark became a tiny box amidst the mighty waters on a vast sea of treacherous waves. The days and weeks of pounding rains, dark skies and the rolling seas had their numbing effect on the entire family. The rain continued to fall from the heavens until the waters covered the highest mountains. Then, on the 41st day, the rains stopped. And the Sun came shining throug once again! Oh, it's so quiet. The rain. I think it's stopped. Oh, thank you, Lord. Thank you. - Noah? Noah. - Emuwnah. - Noah, wake up. - What is it? Noah. Listen. - I don't hear anything. - I know, that's just it! - Look. - NOAH: The Sun. - Is that sunlight I see? - EMUWNAH: Oh, it must be! Oh, Noah, is it true? I'll go take a look. Oh! EMUWNAH: Wake, children! NOAH: Jehovah-God, is it true? Has it happened just as You said? Forty days and the rains will end. Oh, I know Your promises are true. EMUWNAH: Noah, has the rain finally ended? NOAH: Just a moment, Emuwnah, I'm going, I'm going! SHEM: Father, what is it? Can you see anything? NOAH: Just a moment. I'm almost there. Oh! Why'd we put the window on the fourth floor? HAM: Father, what does it look like? NOAH: Not a cloud in the sky. HAM: Okay, but what do you see? No more rain! Make way for the sunshine. ALL: Hey! Hey! Hey! You guys can do better than that. AURELLE: Let's get them! ALL: Hey! NARRATOR: Although the rain had ended, Noah and his family were not aware that their time on the ar had just begun. After more than six months on the ark, Noah yet awaited Jehovah's direction for what he should do next. The vessel floated and floated upon the deep, dark waters. Within the confines of the ark, frustrations were mounting. Once again, their faith was being tested. JAPHETH: Where have you two been? Well, working or sleeping. We don't exactly have a lot of options. -Listen to me. Since we don't know how much longer we're going to be on this ark, I am reducing each animal's food allotment. I've decided to cut the feedings in half. In half? Two bales per day for the large animals, one bale to the medium -sized, and half a bale for the small. But the elephants need that food. That's only because you fed them so much. - SHEM: What? - Look at Sheba. Look, she's huge. And she's getting bigger every day. Now, cut back their food. And get back to work. SHEM: What... - Japheth? - What? Why is there half as much food as usual for the animals? Because we're almost out of food, all right? All right. I was just asking you a question. We're running out of food? When did that happen? KETURAH: Oh, here's more fish for you, Aurelle. Hmm. But we still have plenty of fish. Month after month, fish and water, - fish and water! - Look, just be glad you don't have to eat them, all right? - I'll be back with more. - I've had it with these fish. They flop, they stink, and they're so slimy. Okay. One for the crane, two for the pelicans... I can't do this, I can't do this. Would you stop complaining? I don't like doing this either, but now that we're running out of food for the animals... Are we really running out of food? Or is Japheth just trying to control everything? How dare you say that, Aurelle? Noah put Japheth in charge, because he's the only son responsible enough to get this done right. Ham could work circles around Japheth. How would we know? We've never seen Ham work! Did you hear what she just said? Doesn't matter. We all just need to calm down. We're making all of our decisions based on emotions, not facts. Well, the fact is, your elephants are fat because you won't stop feeding them. Now, I'm going to take care of all of these animals. Like I do all day, every day, Kayla. I'll go feed the giraffes. Stop it, Ebrah, I'm in no mood to play. What, you're hungry? I just fed you two hours ago. That... Oh. Sheba, Ebrah, I'm sorry, but Japheth said I can't. No, wait, Ebrah, give me that! Ebrah, Ebrah, that's not for you! -Shem. You're giving them extra food. No, I'm not. Ebrah just pulled it out of my hand. No, no, no, don't blame it on the elephants. You cannot feed them every time they want food. - But I didn't. - Yes, you did. I just saw you. You take care of your animals, and I'll take care of mine. I'll take care of yours. If we run out of hay, we'll have to kill your hay monsters first. That is not your decision to make. And I know Father would never stand for it. - No animals will be killed. - We'll see about that. You lay one hand on my elephants, I'll lay my fist to you. Try it. - You think I'm kidding... Shem. - That's it, I'm gonna have to teach you a lesson. Next time you... Ow! Come here... Shem, Shem, I'm sorry. I was just kidding. EMUWNAH: Shem! NOAH: Boys, don't fight. Shem, stop it! NOAH: Leak! Leak! Emuwnah, the water is coming in. - Boys, help! - Help, help, get the leak! Water's coming in. It's coming in fast. NOAH: Japheth! Japheth, what have we hit? Go up and look outside. - I just came down. - Do it, my boy! Boy, get the buckets and the pitch and a mallet. Quickly. Shem, help! AURELLE: Father, this cabinet is overflowing. EMUWNAH: And now, my dinner. What's next? NOAH: Right there. Good. Right. Good. Put plenty of pitch around those planks, boys. Make a good patch all the way around them. - Emuwnah. - Yes? - Emuwnah. - What? - No fear, we have it fixed. - We're alive. - Oh. - KAYLA: Thanks for showing up. - Japheth! - You should be thankful. What did we hit? I don't know. I can't see, but it feels like we're on a solid foundation. Maybe we hit a mountaintop and are wedged between rocks. How are we gonna get this ark off a mountaintop? HAM: We can't. We could die here. And you're so worried about... SHEM: If you try another cheap shot... EMUWNAH: Don't bother, dinner is ruined. NOAH: I don't want to hear anything from you either. Now, go. - What's wrong with you? - KETURAH: Shem. NOAH: Get up there. HAM: What? KAYLA: Japheth, how did all this happen? Enough! Control yourselves. Now, let's sit down at the table. We are going to talk, and pray. You had better pray that Japheth doesn't find out about... Well, you know what... EMUWNAH: Ham, that will be enough. - You hear that? - EMUWNAH: You sit there. Shem, sit over there. Keturah, please, get the fruit. Aurelle, Aurelle, dish the cabbage. Now what is this about the food supply? Shem is overfeeding his animals. -Still? - I'm not. - Yes, you are. My God, you know that I didn't... What are you talking about? Everything we know is gone. We're the only people left alive. This boat is balancing on a mountaintop, and here we are arguing? We'll never make it like this. My family, the fear and frustration that grips our hearts is not from the God we know and trust.

KETURAH: Come here. SHEM: There you go. Oh, Shem, he's so cute. Oh, he won't be to Japheth. If he finds out there's one more mouth to feed, I don't know what he'll do. Here you go, sweetie. So this is the new baby elephant. -Oh! Ham, you scared me. I thought you were Japheth. AURELLE: He's so cute. But we don't want Japheth to see him yet, so we're taking him to the lower deck. JAPHETH: Shem! Ham, where are you? - Hide him! - It's an elephant. How're we gonna hide an elephant, Aurelle? Stop yelling at me. I'm trying. - He's coming. - SHEM: Stay down here. JAPHETH: Ham, where have you two been? I've been cleaning out the gorilla stalls all by myself. If the two of you can't show up, when you say that you're going to... Where did this come from? Ooh. If you don't know, I'm not gonna tell you. His name is Goliath. He's Sheba's baby. That's why she'd gotten so big and was eating so much. We didn't know, but we were afraid to tell you. You're afraid to tell me? I just don't know what to do anymore. We are going to run out of food. But I've been so busy caring for these animals, I forgot to care about them. We're gonna make it, Japheth. This elephant is more than the first baby born on the ark. He's a sign of new life to come from the Lord. For all of us. Well, he sure is a cute little thing. - Really? - All right, come on, Goliath. Let's get you back to your mother, where you belong. Hold on. NARRATOR: Eventually, the waters began to recede, and the peaks of the mountaintops appeared. But still, God remained silent with no word of how long they would remain on the ark. So, Noah sent a raven out from the ark in order to explore the unknown world that now existed all around them. But the raven totally forgot about the ark, and those within it, never to return again. And so, Noah decided now to sen his dove out into the unknown. Finding no place to perch, she then returned to Noah. After another seven days, Noah again released his feathered friend in the hope that she would be the bearer of good news. NOAH: Emuwnah, come quickly. EMUWNAH: I'm coming. Oh, I'm getting too old for all of these steps. Ooh. It smells so much better up here. - Now what is it? - Emuwnah, look. Oh, is that Karou? Oh, she's come back. And she's carrying something. NOAH: Oh, welcome home, my faithful friend. - Oh, Emuwnah, look. - A twig. A tiny branch from an olive tree. Oh, Noah, there's dry land out there! Let's open the door now, and set those animals free. - ALL: Yeah! - No, my dear. The Lord told us exactly when to get onto the ark, and I believe He'll tell us exactly when to leave it. All right. We still must wait. We wait! NOAH: They must be your children. I'm just saying. NARRATOR: The return of the dove carrying the live olive branch gave them the hope they had so long awaited. Finally, after many more days, the waters receded. Again, God spoke to Noah. JEHOVAH: Noah. Jehovah-God, is it You? Oh, speak, Lord. I have waited so long to hear Your voice. The waters have dried up. The time has come for you to leave the ark. Right now? Today? Yes, Noah. Go. Thank you. Oh, thank you, Lord! I have waited for Your voice to lead us. I did not want to go on my own wisdom. For You led us into this place, and I knew You would lead us out again. Blessed be Your holy name forever! Oh. One thing, Lord. The door. Will You open it? Just as You closed it? You will open it, Noah. You and your sons shall open it Yes, I will. He did it, He did it. I knew it! JAPHETH: Who did what, Father? Jehovah-God, who cares about every moment of our lives, has spoken to us again. AURELLE: What did He say? He said, open the door! Open the door, sons. After 375 days, we're moving out of here. Blessed be the Lord God, Jehovah. His promises are true. This is the day of new beginnings. - AURELLE: I can't believe we're finally opening the door. Can't you go any faster? JAPHETH: We're going as fast as we can. AURELLE: Kayla, what's it like? HAM: See for yourself. KAYLA: Oh, it's beautiful. Look at them fly. They are free! - Thank you, Lord. - Oh, Shem, land! It feels so good to walk on the earth again. It feels so good to run again. HAM: I have waited for this day for so long. What shall we do now, Father? Can we set the animals free? In time, my son. But first, let us bring an offering to the Lord. Gather stones. We will build a new altar. Oh, Noah, everything is so beautiful.
