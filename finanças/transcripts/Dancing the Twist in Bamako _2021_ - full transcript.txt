Fatou! What's going on? Who are you? I'm the boss here. Who are you? Mrs Fofana Konaté. Bamako's corporate hygiene officer. You should be ashamed. Why? Look at her hands! Caustic soda and chlorine. They need protection and masks. Fatou, aren't you ashamed? Why would I be? They get kitchen gloves. Old gloves with holes. - Note that. - Yes, ma'am. Let's go. Stop them. Adama, we're listening. Adama, don't be afraid. He's half-deaf. Poor boy, you should change jobs. That's all you can say? Today, it's a warning. Get in order in two weeks or we'll shut you down! What does "in order" mean? Come back! What does that mean? What do I do with this? Allah loves those who repent. And those who beg. Is Badian here? He's working. A miracle. Hi, Mum. Hello, son. - Is Dad in? - With your brother. Badian's here? He has to study. I see the mood's good. Your father's very touchy lately. Getting into diving? I ordered 15 pairs of goggles. They sent a boxful. So your lady friend won't hassle me about rules. Who? The militia one who threatened to shut me down if I wasn't in order. Know what? I'm sick of your socialist revolution. It's everyone's revolution, Dad. Calm down. You're too agitated. No, not now. I believed at first. And now? It's not so good. Price controls. Dad, it's to avoid expensive and abusive pricing. And the poorest can live better. Isn't that good? You're right. With my diving goggles, I see more clearly! As your grandfather said, "Dead wood floating in the Niger will never become a crocodile." I don't get it. Me neither. Hey, you! Get to work, you little idiot. Stop laughing. I don't know what to do with him. You helped him at home, but now you preach in the desert. Do you still pray? As a boy, you knew all five prayers by heart. Let's go home. Five more minutes, please! See you all tomorrow! Go on home. Five minutes! Please, five minutes. Just five! Get in! School for you tomorrow and I'll preach in the desert. Hello. Ousmane Diarra, of the Sudanese Union. Samba Touré, mission chief. - How many are you? - I found three guys. Get in. Comrade villagers of Fayira! You all know that Mali is now independent! Our land is free of French colonial domination. And you... must break free of the elders. That's good, but it'd be better in Bambara. Go on, Bakary. Say it in Bambara. Young men... Welcome to my village. Tonight, we celebrate the harvest. We'll join you. I hope so. How old are you, my boy? I'm 20. What does your father do? Bazin, wax, weaving, dyeing. He's a Bamako trader. God protect him. I'll tell you what happened to the Saou peasants. Niger Office people came last month, with gendarmes, to seize the harvest of their lands. What do you call that? It's theft. Not at all. It's their harvest, but it must feed the whole village. Not only the nobles. It's all very simple. The peasantry's future lies in cooperatives that set a price that the poor can pay. It's simple justice. If that's socialism, pack up your gear! I invite you to tonight's feast. This will be tough. I said he wouldn't agree. The old crocodile prefers the black market. He's the chief. That's a colonial invention! No, chiefs are ancient. Socialism is the future. Let's leave. No. We stay and camp here. Enough medicine for everyone. See you later. Enough for everyone? Medicine. Take it once a week. How about trying a twist? What is it in Bambara? - Let's take the plunge. - You can swim? Let go of me! See you next time. What's up? Piss stop? Give me water. I'm thirsty. Where did you learn French? The village has no school. Get me some water. Who is she? A stowaway of female gender. Thank you. You can say "thank you". What's your name? Lara. Lara? What do you want, Lara? A ride to Bamako. Why not ask, instead of hiding? My brother and my husband would kill me! You've run away? I was forced to marry. They kidnapped me in Bamako and paid my father to wed me to Maliki, grandson of Sheikh Moussa, the chief. Sheikh Moussa... I met him. Come with us. No, I don't think so. Desertion of the marital home. She's in the wrong. And we risk trouble. You know that, Samba. Jules is right. Don't screw up. Mali needs its women as much as its men. Coming with us? Let's go. Hi, Lassana. Sleep well? Badian tore his trousers dancing. Drainpipes are too tight. That's funny? He's young. His trousers take priority? Want people to see his behind when they tear? When did he get in? I don't know. He's sleeping. You need a lot of sleep at his age. Dancing won't educate him, Amina. Watch your son! My son is our son! I won't put up with this! What's your problem? Respect your father! A father who works hard so you can study like Samba. Ok, I'm going. I've only missed the gym class. Badian... I've been too patient with you. You're right, Dad. Even black hens lay white eggs. What's that stupid proverb? Whites are better? I need to wash. Good idea. You reek like a rabbit! Who is Oumar Solo? The Bagadadji photographer. He does portraits and photos in clubs. Thanks for my trousers, Mum. - Ok, Mama? - Hello, son. Badian... What? Your father's worried. I know. I worry about him too. Stop playing the fool! I'll pass my exams. I'll keep at it until I do. Badian... You can't dance all your life. Don't start too, Baboli. Everyone's lecturing me! A true Muslim contributes to the development of Islamic society through manual and intellectual work. "Colonization denies the humanity of colonized peoples." Aimé Césaire Villagers of Yékéléla! You have made bricks to build a new school. Each brick produced by your hands allows your sons to learn... your daughters and your sons to learn to read and write. Later, they will be agricultural consultants, nurses, clerks and even teachers! By the river, I saw you making bricks for the dispensary. And I heard you singing. Tears welled up in my eyes. Tears of joy. Each brick you produce makes Mali stronger. Each brick you produce helps to build a new society. One day, all African nations will be free like our Mali. One day, borders will vanish. One day, Africa will become an example for all other continents. One day... One day, the sky will clear! You speak well. Come on, I kept stammering. No, you speak well. You speak with your heart and sound serious. A revolution is serious. You think we'll be free one day? Seriously? Why are you going to Bamako? To see my old bosses. I kept house. They treated me like a daughter. Your husband will come. I'll kill him. My ancestors were slaves, and those of Maliki, the village founders. They set the dowry. That'll change with us. I promise, no more castes. You'll see. We'll have a new family code and women will sit on village councils. The same rules will apply all across Mali. You're dreaming. Yes. Me, I dream as I walk. Here, it's good and shiny. Thanks, boss. Aren't the bosses gone now? Don't worry, there'll always be bosses. I can't set my prices. Is that normal? They're my products. They're mine, and I can't sell them as I want! We must oppose these rules. This isn't economic decolonization. Economic decolonization, what is that exactly? Try thinking, Lassana! Economic decolonization means we will gradually recover the market that the French held until now. A real gold mine. But... there are a few obligations... for traders who do not respect employees and treat them like slaves. You're one, Lassana. You, the king of bazin. Fatou, your wife, hires dyers and beaters by the river. That's no secret, Koulou. How much do you pay those poor women who spend all day splashing around in stinking dye? Koulou Kompè, you've become a real socialist! He's right. The dyers' health is at risk. Now Doussouba the parrot worries about their health? It's simple. If you want a share of this jackpot, all of you must comply with the rules of the Labour Code. Amadou... - Lara... - How are you? Why're you here? The Jacquets said they'd take me to France. You poor dear. They left three weeks ago. Some Russians will come. Nothing changes for me. But you... You shouldn't be in Bamako. Your life's in your village, with your husband. Why're you with these boys? We work for Mali. And for President Modibo Keïta. You too? No, I'm here to find work. Alright... We'll say goodbye. Thanks for bringing me. See you soon maybe. We can't just leave her. Got an idea? She can sleep in Bintou's room. Who's Bintou? My sister, a high school student. See you soon, I hope. I hope so too. Know what? Don't say a thing. I drop you at your place? Don't say you're married. Let me handle it. This is Lara. Hello. Come and eat. Your girl? No. She's here to help her family. It's good to help your family. She could stay in Bintou's room. Certainly not. There are enough of us already. Now your mum handles Mali's future, she forgets she has a home to run. I do everything. Right... I'll get back to work. It's not a big place, but sit down. Mum... I lied. Her family wanted to force her to marry. Lara? Is that true? Yes, it's true. Stay as long as you like. Bintou, set up the camp bed for her. We'll set it up later. I need to find work. Mum can help. She's a hygiene officer. All the traders fear her. And your father? He moans a lot, but he's generous. Ever been to a club? No. My brother and I are in Bamako's best. The Happy Boys' Club. I'll take you. You'll get in with me. We have to dress you. Hold on. Let's see... These might work. Look, they don't fit me. They'd look great on you. They're beautiful. They were my favourites. - Like it? - It's pretty. We all thought independence would let us develop the country and our businesses. On the contrary, it's ruining Mali and our businesses! All consumption is under state control, with its monopoly on imports and exports. The leading traders are losing money! Comrades! Unless we react, they'll take it all, like in Russia! That's the government's secret goal! He's struck by love. Yes, I'm like lightning. You are? I'd like to be struck too! I don't want to get changed. I'm proud of you all. I hope all this will lead us to victory, just like Mali! My brother's so proud. He's made to be in uniform. The army of the people, invincible. The only one I love. It reminds me of Valmy. The French Revolution. Shouldn't we abandon French references? They're international, Bakou. International and universal. Come on, girls. Fall into line. That's it. There... Good. One day, my father said, "Son I see you go out at night At your age, there are things a boy must know, alright With girls, beware You really must take care They're pretty, pretty, pretty as sunshine They're pretty, pretty, pretty and so fine They'll make you mad with joy Mad with suffering but my boy They're pretty, pretty, pretty and all mine YOUTH MINISTRY Sorry it's so late. I had an important meeting. No worries. I read your mission report. You did good work. We did good work. Yes. With Jules and Bakary, we form a shock unit. Well done, Samba. We have a slight problem. The traders. I'm listening. According to my father, who stays out of it, the traders are allying with small producers against the state. If we do nothing, it could create a huge black market. I know all that. A lot of traders were all for independence, hoping French profits would end up in their pockets, with no intention of sharing. There's something else too. I'm listening. Between missions, could I help to draft the new family code? How does that concern you? Are you planning to marry? No. Not at all. Stay focused. Put your energy into urgent tasks. The dream team! He's here. How are you? - Good. You? - Fine. - Coming in like that? - Why not? We don't do politics here, get changed. Amady, don't piss me off. All I want to do after work is have fun. Still no girlfriend in sight? Engaged to the socialist revolution? What's that like in bed? Bintou brought Lara? I don't know her. Alright, let's go. Park and come on in. Having fun? Want to dance? Some other time. I can teach you to dance. Not now! Is it me making you laugh? I hate uniforms. They're ridiculous. - All the same. - All equal. Being equal doesn't make us the same. Are you ok at Bintou's? Yes, her mum found me work. Come and dance! I don't know how to. I swear I don't. Tell me... You learned to dance with the village slaves? And you in the army, between parades? How do you always get the last word? Like this. Badian! Enough! Seen the time? Get to school! You stink of drink! May God punish you! Your father's right. Follow your brother's example. He left for work at 6 AM. Badian... By making you drink alcohol, Satan wants to arouse your hate. Nothing but hate. Screw Satan! Lara! - Ok? - You shouldn't be here. I wanted to see you and admire you... Not while I work. The boss watches us like a hawk. He looks ok. Go now. Let me work. I love you. Where are we going? To dress you as the princess you are. Don't move. This is Mama Coumba. My father's second wife. How many wives does he have? Three. And they all work for him. Mama, cut four metres of bazin for my fiancée. Your fiancée? When did you get engaged? Today. The priciest bazin too. Does your father know? Give me that. You don't want to do it. Out of the way. Let me. You get on my nerves. Why are you crying? Because I love you, Samba. Were you with Samba? I woke you. No, I wasn't asleep. I made love with Samba. Was it your first time? I lied, Bintou. I married Maliki three months ago. One day, when I was cooking, Maliki came to me and he said, "Seeing you move turns me on. I'll fuck you good tonight." He said that on entering our room. After that, he spread my legs. He said, "You're mine. Mine alone. Your body is mine. I'm your husband. Your ass is mine." You have to forget that. Do you love Samba? Really love him? I'll only ever love him. My friends, the goal of this meeting is to judge Bamako's clubs and the validity of their activities. Rock and roll is not a political programme per se. Youth's energy needs channelling for something other than wiggling about. Samba is the perfect example of a boy who has renounced pleasure to focus on youth work. Just a second. I go to a club with my crew every night. What do you want? To close them? No, we just want to know what goes on there. Gabriel Bakou must make proposals so young people won't be trapped by this music's illusions. For his report, he needs information. Go there. That's not funny. Lots of girls get pregnant and give birth to fatherless twister boys. There's a link between clubs and school results. Let's look at the Triana in Bamako's Coura district. What do you want to know? How does it work? Is there a dress code? Yes. The boys all dress European style. Bell-bottom or drainpipe trousers. To hug the figure. I'll note your answer. "They hug the figure." Girls can't wear African clothes or flat sandals. No flip-flops. All African clothes are banned? Short skirts are recommended for girls. When I hear that, I feel the youth of Mali is at risk. Young people turn away from tradition, spit on family and surrender to sexual excess! That isn't the socialist revolution's goal. Salif, calm down. This isn't a rally. Samba is here to help. I want names. The list of active members, their jobs if they work, their schools, and what they think of our policy. What's the list for? To learn about them. To see if their activities are subversive and counter-revolutionary. You're crazy. It's just dancing and music. Is dancing counter-revolutionary? In a way, yes. Education of the masses must begin with re-education. Who was that actor in... Rebel Without a Cause? The hothead. James Dean. Dead at 24 in his Porsche! Samba, is that the future of Malian youth? To paraphrase Lenin, socialism is the soviets, plus electrification, plus the twist. Lenin said that? Bakou is a madman. I hate him. The Political Bureau is full of madmen We have to live with it. Besides... Bakou has a point. The people mobilized for independence. Since independence, they've turned apolitical. We must create revolutionary awareness while we can. We can't do it by force. Daily life has to improve for all to see, via a policy of justice and liberty. You're dreaming, Samba. Dreamers change the world. Arms around each other's shoulders! That's it! In the water, yes! I have an essay on emancipation. Can you help? Sure. Profit from it. What? It concerns us all. Mali's emancipation means what? Being 18, with no one pissing me off. That's pretty egocentric. Egocentric. The words you use! Emancipation is freedom from servitude, domination, alienation... Let me write that down. Know what kids used to sing in school? What? "France is our mother She feeds us With her potatoes And her macaroni" Ok, Samba? Am I disturbing you? Not at all, Dad. We're working. - We're working. - Does the dunce listen? - Sure he does. - Sure I do. You better had! God be praised. Good luck. Thanks. Samba... One question? Go ahead. Must we emancipate ourselves from love? From love? No. Only from passion when it becomes servitude. Why do you ask? Lara... Is she yours? She isn't anyone's. - Not her husband's? - She didn't want him. So she's emancipated? Yes. After the rains, with water in the yard, do like him. Take some soil... and fill the holes. Alright? It'll keep mosquitoes and germs away. Then they won't come biting you. Silence, young people. Shut up! Mr Gabriel Bakou will speak on behalf of President Modibo Keïta! Young people! As he has said several times, our president, Modibo Keïta, places his hopes in our youth that he calls "Tomorrow's Mali". Your energy and dynamism must serve our nation. Henceforth, obey the Youth Commissioners.... - Clubbing tonight? - You bet, with Bintou. The movement concerns young people of both sexes, aged eight to eighteen. It'll be your movement, designed to defend traditional culture against the imperialist music sent by our former colonizers. Socialism has shown us the ideal path for tomorrow's society. But, for it to become a reality, we'll have to work hard. Did you hear, young comrades? Yes, Commissioner! Forward for the eradication of our weaknesses! Repeat. Forward! Forward! Honour Roll Write. Dear and most honourable president, Modibo Keïta. Dear... I am desperate. For... since my wife now takes care, along with our yard, of cleaning all the neighbourhood yards, which I find unusual, she no longer has time to cook the food I love. And my health is starting to suffer. My health is starting to suffer... As my friend Malek says... As my friend Malek says, the struggle for the new Mali does not abolish conjugal duties. Why are you laughing? - Is it disrespectful? - No. Come in. Sit down. My little Lara, I'm giving you a small bonus because I'm fond of you. So you'll work faster. What is it? Want to annoy me? Thank you, Mr Soriba. That's good, my little Lara. Now my turn. I deserve a little reward. Come on. Let go of me! Grab her! In her favour, Soriba Diarra has a conviction for attempted rape. They'll release her on parole. But I can't replace the judge on her case, understand? I have a question. Why does she interest you? If you saw her, you'd understand. That's what I feared. You know she's married and fled her village? No. I didn't know. Sure you didn't? Now you do. My advice is to stop seeing her. You can stay seated. You're fond of Samba. What I'm asking is tricky. Where is he at with this married girl? Do you know? Yes, I know. He's really in love. He's not in love. He's just having fun. I keep telling him his behaviour must be irreproachable. He worries us. That's why I want you to watch him. I'm very fond of Samba. I don't want him to stray. Is that all? No. His father is one of Bamako's top traders. The traders are meeting a lot lately. I'd like to know what they're plotting. Why say you were married? We're both in the shit. In the countryside, religious marriage is more important. It won't be easy imposing a code that frees a woman from obeying a chief and her father. Just tell me how to get out of an arranged marriage. Only a village chief can grant a divorce. But, in Bambara country, many women prefer death to divorce. They think equality is for women like me, educated, rich, city women. They're not wrong. You know, Samba, in this area we'll need a few more centuries. I saw Mariam Diallo. Who's she? A friend. She's on the Women's Social Commission. Is she beautiful? She's... very... very... very, very, very b... She's less beautiful than you. She's very reassuring. With the new family code, you can get a divorce. Is that true? Yes, it's true. So we'll end our days together? Welcome, young man. Here to explain socialism again? No. So sit and have some tea. How's your father? I'm here about Lara. Lara? If you know, tell me where she is. Her family lives in shame. She doesn't love your grandson. You've come all this way to explain love? Lara is from a big family. We gave them fields by the river. It's good land. And five fat cows too to feed the family. That's love. The world has changed. Cooperatives will feed her parents. And the new family code will ban forced marriages. You can grant a divorce and recover the dowry. Maliki has honoured his wife. If he hadn't, I'd grant the divorce. Raping her is honouring her? There's no rape in a marriage! The world won't change. My grandson will be chief here one day. The son he'll have with Lara will be chief in turn. As night follows day. Maliki. Money for fuel and expenses. Bring her back fast. Yes. Be stronger than your rage. I'm counting on you. Boubakar, watch over your brother-in-law. No alcohol. I told her to go back to her village. We don't care what you told her. Where is she? I don't know. She left with the guys who came to hassle us. Was it a government van? - I don't know. - You do! Speak, I'm her big brother. She's with Bintou's family. Bintou Konaté. Her brother is Bakary. That's all I know. Come on, my friends. Ok? You're too serious for a photo. Give me a smile. There, both of you smiling. Listen, Samba, all I can see are your nostrils! Good. That's perfect. Free your bodies! Your Lara is so beautiful! Got your wedding licence? No, not on me. - I'm Samba Touré, pioneer leader. - Screw that. We check on adulterers. Come with us. Let's go to the police. I know you, thief. - Calm down. - Aren't you in jail? Calm down. Let's go to the police together. Get lost! Forget it. Carry your papers next time. I got checked by two militia jerks fresh out of jail. They dishonour the cause. You think I don't know? We make do with the men we have. Good news for Lara. It's going to end in an acquittal. She'll go back to her village. Still see her? She's married. And on the run. Because of you? Because of the shit custom of forced marriage! Calm down. The new code will change that. In a century! - Revolutions take time. - And fail! Enough! I need you, so drop this. You leave on a mission tomorrow. An educational one to villages you know. Nothing is working. Collective fields are fallow School and dispensary construction is slow. We need people like you. Loyal supporters of socialism. You hear? What do we do? Nothing for now. Too many of them. We should go home. - Are you mad? - Her eyes are shining. So? - She looks happy. - Screw that! Shit, I'll kill her. Call this normal? The state gives you a field! The village owns the field. It's a gift for you! No, the owner is the state. You say it's ours, but you take everything. It's not for me. It's for health, education, roads... The villagers say only the officials will profit. Ok, what do we do? We get to work. It'll be your money, it's your harvest. That's socialism. It's that simple. It's the sharing of wealth between... between those who... those who create it. Come on. Stop talking, they understand. Come on. In my belly, there's a child that isn't yours. If you want, it'll be our child. Keep driving! Who's this I see? Ok, buddy? Why so grim? What's wrong? What's up, honey? The cops contacted her husband. He knows where she stays. Are you serious? Can I stay here? I'll even clean for you. Stay as long as you like, even without cleaning. Come on, I'll buy you a drink. Stop looking so grim. Here... We'll get rid of the bottles to make you a love nest. It'll be ok, kiddoes. They'll end up finding her. Want my advice? Both leave the country. Don't waste your youth. You only get it once. I know why you hesitate. But Mali will be built even without you. In a few hours, the Republic of Mali will have its own currency, the Malian franc. No need to be an economist to know that a national currency is a guarantee of freedom and, even better, a tool of power. You'll have a few days to swap African colonial francs, CFA francs, for Malian francs. It will be up to you, comrades, to denounce traffickers, speculators, opportunists and degenerate officials! Serve the revolution, yes! Profit from the revolution, no! Thank you, we're closing. The school is empty, filled with hens. No books, no chairs. Even the board we took has gone. School has to become obligatory. People don't see the results of our work. We must act faster. Only God can help you. He can ensure every child gets a baccalaureate. In my opinion, God is with the capitalists. I can't do more. I'm tired. I won't join you on the next mission. Come on, my friends... Here, drink. Drink to the health of God and of Modibo Keïta, ok? Here, honey. What? You're religious now? Since when? We set an example. As the vanguard, we must be faultless. We have to step back. Every one of us must respect the traditions colonization made us forget. That's why you don't drink? Exactly. And why you must take Lara back. So that after litres of palm wine, stinking, his hands filthy, he can jump on me and rape me? Is that tradition? What do you know? What was that? Get out! Get out! You're off our team! There is no team! It's getting screwed up. It'll be dangerous for Lara. We weren't prepared for socialism. And, without socialism... independence... is impossible. Come on, hurry it up! - Where are you from? - Côte d'Ivoire. You know imports are banned? I do as my boss says. Come with me. You two, stay here. Soriba Diarra was arrested yesterday for fraud. He asked for it. He robs our country. You mix everything up. Shut up, Coumba. I can't trade with Senegal anymore. It's a disaster for me. I preferred the French. The new currency will ruin us. Look at Guinea. Independence led to a communist bloc takeover! What do we decide? We must all demonstrate on the streets of Bamako! Well said! I vote for Madame Sy's demonstration! To have a big crowd, we'll need our workers and retailers. We must enlist the market's peasants too. They'll bring all the villagers. Long live De Gaulle! Down with the Malian franc! Free trade! Free trade! Down with the Malian franc! Long live the CFA franc! Long live the CFA franc! Samba Touré. Assistant Youth Commissioner. What's going on? There was an attempted coup, with many terrorists arrested. It's under control. Go ahead. In an exclusive interview, President Modibo Keïta declared that a coup against the republic has been foiled. According to him, most traders were manipulated by power-hungry politicians. He promised the leaders will be shown no mercy. 196 rioters have been arrested. Your father too. He's accused of being a crook and a traitor. What? In any case, God knows how to sort the good from the evil. And your father is a believer who never betrayed anyone. No preaching now. Koulou Kompè was arrested too. He knows Fily Dabo Sissoko, who urged them to demonstrate against the government. Your father knows Koulou Kompè and so... Every warehouse is sealed. No one can work. We can't trade for now. Your Modibo is a dictator. He uses such events to assert his authority. That's how it starts. It's not true! Modibo Keïta is no dictator! The traders want a free-market economy and the CFA franc as they have always profited from that, it's that simple. Those who don't care about the people's well-being have no place in the new Mali. You're calling your father a profiteer? Why did he do this? Go back to your friend Namori. This isn't your family anymore. Samba! Look what they did! The militia came to the club to shave my head! It's nothing, Badian. It'll grow back. Grow back? Your pals called me a fag! The surveillance brigades aren't my pals. Jules was with them! This is a magistrate's report. It concerns the charges against your father. It was a genuine conspiracy. Seriously? He confessed. It's in the police report, I didn't invent it. This is totally absurd. My father isn't into politics. The pre-demonstration meeting was at his warehouses. Most traders are friends. Old friends. And now our enemies! President Keïta has decided that the 95 defendants will be brought before a people's court. A public trial. Sorry, I can't do anything. I can... only allow you to visit the jail. But that's not all. I told you to stop seeing Lara Samassoko. She was on a mission. Who told you? The brigades who scalped my brother? Or my friend Jules Baki? I followed you at first. I followed you blindly like a master. You taught me... Even to betray? Wasn't it Gabriel Bakou? - Or you, Namori? - Enough! You betrayed my trust with Lara! You make me sick. Since your independence, I queue. You intellectuals wanted it and we end up queuing for hours. Before, you didn't queue and you starved. Now, you can feed your kids, so get off my back. Is it because of your dreams? You're my dream. You and... our little child. Five minutes. What did they do to you? Nothing. Nothing at all. I fell over. Thank you. It's good. Thank you, my son. The public trial is on September 24. I'll say I helped organize the traders' demonstration and acknowledge all the charges. I'll say I made a very big mistake. Does that suit you? Why do you ask me? I'll also say I know Fily Dabo Sissoko. You never met him! I knew a man who plotted... Dad, stop! Well? They must have beaten him. He's scared, talking nonsense. What can we do? I don't know, Mum. Before, you knew everything. Now, you know nothing. Sudanese Union African Democratic Rally Hi, Samba. Is Bakou in his office? No, they're in a meeting. It's tense. Don't disturb them! I saw my father in jail last night. He had been beaten. He had been intimidated. He was made to sign nonsense. Where are we here? The Sudanese Union or the KGB under Stalin? You got the wrong door, my boy. See the Interior Minister. He'll send me here. You control the government! Gabriel... Why is this young fool here? He's Namori Diakaté's protégé. And says screw you! You're paranoid, obsessed with plots! The traders didn't stage a coup! Enough! Were you at the demonstration? Burning our flag is an attack on the republic. The French are watching us. Foccart is lurking in the wings. Independence suits them as long as their interests are safe. Socialism terrifies them. They arm Guinean exiles against Sékou Touré. The British tried to assassinate Nkrumah. Just as the Belgians chopped Lumumba to bits. Open your eyes! Your father will get what he deserves. I move that we immediately declare the temporary exclusion from the Party of Samba Touré. Closed by order of the Hygiene Department "Western music incites debauchery." Even so, they drank all they could. What they couldn't drink, they took. Not a drop left. They took all the records and my stock of Salut les Copains. This is the latest issue. I saved one. Stop drinking. I'm sick of waiting. You're right. Enough jerking us around. We're closed. Amady, it's Bintou! What's wrong? What happened? Boubakar, Lara's brother, was outside our house. He was with another guy. He thinks she's there? No. I said where you were. He had a knife... I'm sorry, Samba. - It's ok. - No one blames you. Badian, look after her. Count on me, bro. We have to leave. Are you sure? Yes, he's sure. Take the train to Dakar. I'll join you there. My dad's in the Kidal camp. I want to check on him to see how they treat him. And after Dakar? The sky will clear. I'll park and wait for you. Have a safe trip and take care. I'll look after Samba. Don't worry. Thank you, Amady. You're welcome. - Goodbye. - Bye. Go to the Porte de Retour Hotel near the station. Get a room for a month. I'll be there sooner. I promise. I'm sick of it. Let's go home. Keep the dowry for your family. That's crazy, Maliki. Your sister will never love me. Can't you see that? I won't go back without her. We can't live with the shame! We find her and take her back. Get on. I'll fetch a ticket. Go on. Sit if you want a good seat. I'll sit down later. When you come back. Think of our child. Where's Lara? Tell us where she is. Tell us! Samba! Today, I carried out the arrest of Lara Samassoko. She admits that, while married to Maliki Moussa, she fled the marital home and her village of Fayira to begin an adulterous relationship with a certain Samba Touré. Lara Samassoko's husband legitimately attempted to get his wife back as she was taking a train to Dakar. In front of witnesses, Samba Touré attacked Boubakar Samassoko who defended himself with a knife with no intention of killing, which unfortunately was not the case. The soldiers on the platform had a hard time controlling Lara Samassoko who clung to her lover's body like a toad in heat. They thus had to use force to detach her and bring her to the police station. - No, Mum! - Want us all to end up in jail? One day, the sky will clear. Come on, let's go. - Bring them tomorrow? - Ok. Off you go now. I've seen enough of you. My heart aches, Samba. My darling Samba. You never knew your daughter. But she knows you well. I told her all about you. I taught her to dance like we did. Your grandchildren too. You see, I remember. You were right, Samba. But you advanced alone and I had doubts. The others too. We all regret it now, with the bearded men who stop us listening to music. You built schools. They destroy them. They destroy hospitals. They destroy theatres. They want to destroy life. And France is back without thinking that if Africa had never been colonized, things would not be so bad today. Subtitles by Ian Burley Subtitling CINELI DIGITAL
