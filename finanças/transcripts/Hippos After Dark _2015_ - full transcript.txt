attack... intimidate... breed... feed... rest... defend... for a dominant hippo bull, this is routine. by day, his rule is indisputable, but when the sun sets, predators take control. at night, his order turns to chaos. the river bull must leave his watery stronghold and enter the danger zone. on this turf, the tables are turned, and he must pit his brawn against the dangers after dark. it's as surefire as the sunrise, the age-old power struggle between hunter and hunted, and today the sun rises on a grisly scene. there's been a killing. the balance has swung in favor of the hunters, and the hippos have lost a valuable calf. for this hippo mother, self-preservation is the only option. the best course of action is to follow the path that will lead her back to the safety of the river. but hippos don't usually run from a fight, so how did it come to this? this is the river bull. he presides over this prized stretch of water. it's his battleground for mating rights. females are precious commodities, and protecting his harem requires guts and power. the river bull is always on guard. other bachelors enter at their own risk. they must submit or pay the price. weighing in at two tons, he's a formidable ruler that not many would challenge, but controlling the river is only half the story. access to land is critical, and right now, the river bull is losing his foothold on the vital feeding grounds that border his watery empire. hippos get most of their nutrition on terra firma, and to get from the river to their nighttime buffet, they need to cross the predator zone, a dangerous gully and an ideal ambush site for night stalkers. the river bull and his family travel a mile on land in search of good grazing. it's a long haul, but that's not their only challenge. a new threat has arrived on the riverbank. they're a roving pride of lions, undernourished and looking for territory. it's the dry season... a daily battle for survival, and like the hippos, they rely on both land and water. 12 lions of various ages... it's a lot of mouths to feed. to satisfy 12 bellies efficiently, they need to set their sights on big prey. they're hungry and thirsty. temperatures are soaring over 100 degrees, and they can smell water. to get a drink, they need to breach the riverbank. but this is hippo country, and they must respect the bull's territory. hippos are fiercely territorial and notoriously aggressive when defending their patch. even lions give them a wide berth. but the pride male bows to no one. a single lion is no match for an enraged hippo ten times his weight. the waterline marks the boundary, and to cross it, he'd better be primed for battle. when it comes to armor, the river bull reigns supreme. his two-inch-thick hide weighs hundreds of pounds. hippos have no true sweat glands, so the only way to keep all that skin cool is to spend the day submerged in water. it's no big surprise when you consider their closest relatives are whales. their huge lungs allow them to take in several liters of air in one breath. this affords them at least five minutes underwater. but huge air-filled lungs are like floatation tanks, so they need a counterweight. to compensate for their buoyancy, a hippo's legs consist of 100 percent solid bone. like a diver's weight belt, their short, heavy legs anchor them to the riverbed. topside, they can get away with just their eyes, ears, and nostrils breaking the surface... minimum exposure and maximum vigilance. the river bull's lineage goes back 35 million years to a common ancestor with whales. his semiaquatic existence depends on water, mud, and grass. as long as he can wallow in the day and feed at night, life is good. his enormous bulk also means that he has very few enemies. in fact, the river bull has allies. a small army of oxpeckers escorts the family wherever they go. these plucky little birds feed off parasites on the skin and attend to any open wounds. they're even known to have a healthy appetite for earwax. the oxpecker's feet are specially adapted to cling to the sides of their hosts. sharp, curved claws for optimum grip and short legs keep them close to the skin. their stiffened tail feathers act as support to prop them up on the sides of their moving meal cart. but even the best dinner guest can outstay his welcome. there's good reason that the collective name for oxpeckers is a fling. it's mating season, and the river bull has breeding rights to all 10 females in his pod. he can afford to sit back and choose. it's one of the most bizarre courtship displays in the animal kingdom. he woos his potential mate by flinging testosterone-laced feces to advertise his dominance and lure her into submission. the bull's s-shaped penis is fibroelastic, which means it can bend and flex, thanks to a pair of retractor ligaments. these help him to wield a reproductive organ almost 4 feet long, and weighing 3 1/2 pounds, longer and heavier than babe ruth's baseball bat. the river bull's feces-flinging paid off, and it's time for hippo foreplay. this is not a gentle affair. he's forcing her head underwater so he can mount her. hippos do just about everything in water, even mate. his genes secured for the next generation, the bull prepares for the long night ahead. as the moon rises, the river bull's daytime rule slowly sinks into uncertainty. shrouded in the cool evening air, the hippos emerge like zombies from a watery grave. they boast the largest canines in the animal kingdom, but they're grazers, consuming as much as 150 pounds of grass in a night. under the surveillance of invisible light, the secret transformation of this cantankerous killer unravels. the river bull is no longer a fierce, territorial warrior, but a skittish, lumbering herbivore in search of food. the river bull takes the lead. every night, it's the same blue funk. he may be walking into a trap. nighttime belongs to the flesh-eaters and ambush hunters. the rest follow, but then disperse. it's each to their own against the dark night ahead. they eat on the march. their multichambered stomachs provide slow-release energy to fuel their laid-back lifestyle. the river bull is on course for a special treat. the oddly shaped fruits from the sausage tree have medicinal properties used for protection from sun exposure. but it won't save his hide from a hungry pride of lions. both hippo and lion rest by day and feed by night. their worlds are about to collide. the pride has him on their radar. they have six times stronger night vision than humans, and they're specialist after-dark assassins. hippo isn't often on the menu for lions, but they're lean and aching for a meal. if the pride works together as a team, they may stand a chance against the distracted river bull. it's worth the wager. big hunger needs a big hit, and 2 tons of flesh could sustain the 12 lions for a couple of weeks. less hunting means less risk of injury, but large prey is more dangerous. it's a catch-22. the river bull might not be on a par when it comes to his night vision, but he is highly attuned to the smell of danger in the air. he could pit his strength against one lion, but he won't take his chances against the whole pride. he knows when he is out of his depth. on land, he is vulnerable. as dawn cracks the horizon, the hippos return to their fortress. like zombies racing the rising sun, they must return to their protective tomb of water. soon the golden glow will turn to white heat that could parch their thirsty skins. their thunderous bellows alert the family to danger and can be heard almost a mile away. one by one, they return to their wallow... negotiating the steep runways created by generations of hippos before them. the river bull is last on the scene. he deviated from his path to avoid the lions, and now he's facing a steep challenge. negotiating a 15-foot-long body down a sheer cliff is no easy feat. he could take another route, but he's the river bull, and nothing stands in his way. like a hulk of ice calving off a glacier, he's back in his watery domain. the heat is already taking its toll. beads of red liquid ooze from the river bull's skin. it's known as blood sweat, but it's neither. special glands under his skin secrete a unique form of hippo sunscreen. the same liquid contains powerful antibacterial properties. it's an evolutionary solution to both sunburn and festering wounds, and it's about to be put to good use. a hippo's yawn is not a sign of fatigue from a long night out grazing. the river bull is advertising his razor-sharp fighting tusks. aggression spikes when rival bulls battle for territory and breeding rights. this is the season when the river bull's temper is at full throttle. once again, his paddle-shaped tail flings territory-marking dung. it's literally the poop hitting the fan. because his dung carries testosterone, it's a clear-cut warning to other males, "i'm not only bigger, i'm dominant, and i'm angry." his massive tusks sharpen every time he closes his mouth. they're almost two feet long and designed to gore and stab. his skin is a two-inch-thick suit of armor. he's built to attack and defend. they square up... the river bull from the left, the challenger from the right. the river bull could lose his females and his territory if his opponent beats him down. he has everything to fight for. the river bull has met his match. their massive heads alone weigh half a ton. it's a heavy weapon to sustain. the opponent stands down, and the river bull keeps his title. their built-in antiseptic will quickly heal their wounds, and the bachelor will return for a rematch. it's time-out after a round of full-body combat. some of the family shed new light on the term "beached whales." others wallow while their allies get busy cleaning up the wounds. their little feathered nurses are not altogether innocent. they have another motive. blood is the oxpecker's favored diet. these little vampires-in-disguise may even prolong the healing process with their constant picking. they're not the only ones getting a free meal. in this territory, life is a constant cycle of defending your patch and finding food, and sometimes there's a windfall. the drought has claimed a victim but provided relief. a fallen elephant is food for a diversity of diners. crocodiles drift in on the feast. they can survive a year without food, but given the opportunity, they can consume 23 percent of their body weight in one sitting. it's a free-for-all, but to get there, the lions will have to enter river territory and get past the crocs. one young male is hungry enough for the challenge. it's a super-predator face-off. he may have bitten off more than he can chew. backup's on its way, but they're still high up on the riverbank. the river bull wades in. his territory is being breached, and he doesn't tolerate trespassers. for the croc, it's a perfect diversion. he retreats to deeper waters. the lions take to higher ground. it's a stalemate. keeping your head above water in this battleground is not always easy. the smallest member of the hippo family is starting to find his feet. baby hippos are born underwater, and they stick close to their mothers to stay out of danger. they can only hold their breath for 30 seconds, and like their mothers, they can't swim. they tiptoe along the riverbed with long, graceful strides. his father may be the river bull, but in this neighborhood, there's no time for child's play. it's dinnertime, and the river is rumbling with hungry bellies. the day winds to a close, and another pilgrimage begins. the sun sets, but the warmth is still evident in the heat signature coming off the hippos. their hot bodies emit infrared radiation, which shows up in bright splashes where they are warmest. even the ground is holding on to the heat of the day and resembles molten lava. spreading feces not only marks territory, but also creates a trail which will guide them back to the river later. and so the long march begins. once again the hippos are under surveillance, and this time, there's a soft target. a baby hippo with tender skin would be a mouth-watering snack for a pride of hungry lions. but tonight the predators have their sights set on a bigger meal. there's an unfinished feast at the water's edge, and now the lions can approach under the cover of darkness. the crocodiles are doing a good job on the cleanup operation. disposing of the dead is a valuable role. the lioness' hunger consumes her. nothing will deter her from the feast. the croc backs down. he's learned his lesson, but there's still unfinished business here. in these times of feast and famine, owning this carcass could mean survival. outnumbered, the pride will stay hungry, while the crocodiles make off with the lions' share. the harsh season is tightening its grip. the river bull is sinking deeper into troubled waters. rival males are challenging him at every turn. his days are a series of violent clashes, and he's fighting hard to hold on to his harem. nearby, the crocodiles are feasting on the weak and the dead and growing fat on the demise of the drought-stricken territory. the lions have annexed the riverbank. there's nowhere to hide from their constant demand for flesh. something's got to give. as the river territory shrinks, the land predators are gaining ground. youngsters are no longer safe, and their mothers have no way of protecting them from the hidden dangers after dark. the river is drying up, and the boundaries are shifting. even the age-old hippo runways are crumbling around them. the lions keep their nightly surveillance, always ready for the right moment and the perfect opportunity. good grazing is edging further away, and the hippos now need to travel three miles to feed, deep into lion territory. the river bull sticks to his path. he's naturally wary. but it's not easy to shake off a night stalker. the predators are patient and sometimes a little too confident. the bull still has the advantage of his two-ton brawn. it's time to change their game plan and pursue a less daunting target. a young calf is grazing with his mother. a surprise attack could be their meal ticket. the baby hippo has no defense against a hungry pride of lions. his legs are too heavy to outrun them, and his tusks are barely grown. his only choice is to submit to his fate. lions usually suffocate their prey by smothering their noses or crushing their windpipes, but the hippo's unusual design has them baffled. the death cry travels far and wide through the territory. while the lions feast, the hippos seek safety back in the river. only the desperate mother stays, helpless to save her calf, but determined not to leave him behind. the standoff won't save her baby, but her maternal instincts are hardwired to stand up and fight. the lions have stained their territory with the blood of their hippo neighbors, but the river bull will live to fight another day. it's as surefire as the sunrise, the age-old battle between hunter and hunted, and as each day brings order to the hippos, so each night will plunge them back into chaos.
