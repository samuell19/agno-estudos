Keikichi, what are you doing? But, mum, I can't today. Oh, yes, it's so windy today. Do it another time when there's no wind. mum, are you going somewhere? I'm going nowhere. Keikichi. Come. For your sweeping, even though it's made no difference. Go and play. Bro. Hey, boy, running errands? Oji-chan has come. You're late. Oji-chan, present. Present? Sorry, I forgot. What a pity. Rei-chan expected something. She's always asking me, "when will oji-chan come?" Oji-chan is like a stranger. This isn't the time for that. What's the matter? I'm in a bad way. Are things that bad? - I'm down on my luck. - Really? The value's dropped 80-yen. I'm helpless. - mum! - What? There are some kintsuba sweets. Go there and eat them. Be a good girl. It's because you forgot her gift. How shabby. The end of the world. I'll put six pairs in your bag. No, you don't need to anymore. Why not? - I'm moving out of the apartment. - What? Double-living is uneconomical. That's true, do it. Yes it's uneconomical as it is. What a good idea. But this place isn't convenient for transportation. You must accept it. Let's do it. But... There's no need to hesitate. Matsuo! Matsu-chan, you're being called. Time for supper. Yoshio! Yoshi-bo, meal's ready. Ken-chan. One got away. Gee. Tadashi-kun. - Let's go to school. - Yes, let's. - A sparrow again? - Yes. - Did you catch one? - Yes. - That's a lie. - I can show you on the way back. Really? Dear, where are you? Dear? What were you doing? your meal's getting cold. It's a pity. A pity, what is? Because I'm here. Why? You are strange. I never think this is hardship. Don't pity me. No, not you. The boy. I'm not good for him. Stop this nonsense so early in the morning. - I feel bad this early. - Why so? You could say I'm an obstructive presence to the boy. Just look at his sullen face. When a grown-up man is treated as a nuisance by a child, how can he be comfortable. - So, what are you going to do? - What will I do? The best thing is that I don't show myself. Keikichi's sullen face gets on my nerves, meanwhile I feel sorry for him. Who did this? No, no. It's escaped. Escaped! mum, mum, who released my sparrow? Who did it? mum, mum. Shut up! Come now, bad child! Crybaby. Crying like a baby over such a small thing. Why you are like that? No wonder you get on oji-san's nerves. Hurry, wash your face. Keikichi. You know, even if aunt asks about our house, just say "don't know". OK? You are so stupid sometimes. Don't chat too much. OK? Do you understand what I'm saying? Ohiro-chan, are you at home? Are you? Isn't she at home? Hi, sis, welcome. I thought you weren't home. - Visiting with the kids. - As always. Don't forget to say hello to auntie. Everything is so slow to dry. I've invaded next door's space. Where's Kanzo-san? Seeing as it's so fine, he went out for a stroll. He hopes the fine weather will put his publisher in a good mood. I'm sick of it. A failed novelist. Business is the same for everyone. Outsiders are envious, though. Yes, true. Kei-chan. Buy some Golden Bat cigarettes. Close it carefully. All we ever do is complain. I'll make some tea. Don't bother. No problem. Just tea. What a change! The gas and electricity are both on. At it again. We got some money a few days ago. When was that? Last month. We spent it on luxuries after all this time. But a couple of hundred goes so quickly. Listen. Can I ask you a favour again. What is it? About Keikichi. What is it? It's gone off. What strange gas. I'll open a tea shop. So I can't look after the house for a week or so. I'll have so many thing to do with the shop. Please, just a week or so. - I want you to take Keikichi. - Again. When I open the shop you can help me with it. Putting rouge on my cheeks and carrying tea at my age? I can't trust you, sis. I have no credit with you, have I? - Of course not. - But this time it's true. I don't know. Please take him. Kei-chan, hey, Kei-chan. Are you with mother? On an errand? Give me one. Were you going for a walk, oji-san? Far? Many places. - Was it interesting? - Not very. Everywhere is full. there's no space for oji-san. Wait until reduction time, there'll be less people. Well said. I can't wait till reduction time, I'll get hungry If I wait so long I'll die of hunger. You're no good. Let me do it. Let's do it. Are you going to play, oji-san? It's not fair. You're grown-up. - That's unfair. - Nonsense! Let's go. OK. Let's go. I'll take mother these cigarettes. Oh, no, out. No good. Look Shin-koh. Oh, idiot. I wondered what you were doing. Stop it. You too. You should be ashamed of yourself. How was it? Could you sell one or two? It's frustrating. All three failed. To begin with, they won't even read them. - I thought so anyhow. - What do you mean "anyhow"? I wish they'd read them at least. Look, this "Madame Grasshopper and "A Life with Scrofula" are masterpieces. It's no good telling me. You must appeal to the publishers. You give in too easily. You fool. I'm struggling. Well, I don't know. Dear, my sister has asked me to take Kei-chan again, for a week. I can't trust her. Her new man doesn't like the child. I know. Are you on her side? I'll have all the trouble. I told her I'd discuss it with you. Please refuse nicely. - But she's your sister. - I don't like to. - Don't talk like a stranger. - I don't want to refuse either. If you earned more and could afford to, I'd be willing to take care of him. It's your fault. You're so happy-go-lucky. Dear. If I'm with you it won't work. Talk to her by yourself, refuse nicely. What is she doing, I wonder. Look how your nails have grown. mum, I was surprised. What was it? A woman made her nails blood-red. That's nail polish. It's strange. Hey, you here? Yes, we are bothering you. Done now. Throw these away. Hard times ahead. Likewise with me. I'll make it. Actually, parents and a child, we three barely eat. But I envy your family. You can live parents and child together. Look at me. I'm full of troubles, no incentive to live. Poor me. - Cigarette? I have some. - No, no. Listen, I've asked Hiroko-san. Have you seen Hiroko-san? - Yes, I met her out there. - Have you heard? Please help me. - Alright. - Good! Please. Alright. My Shin-ko is pleased because he has a playmate. - Shin-chan. - Oh, they are back. My boy's already gone to school. Your paw. It's Kei-bo. What are you doing? Oji-chan, I'm hungry. Yes, at oji-san's house we work nights and get up late. I see. Hey, Hiroko. Keikichi can't wait for brunch like us. Wake up and make him some food. He's your responsibility, you get his breakfast. - Are you still angry? - Of course I am. Don't yell. It's shameful. My sis is awful. Leaving her child as she likes. She knows you're a pushover. I won't do any housework until Keikichi is sorted out. Really. I just won't. What are you doing? Come. Oji-chan, it's a kimono, isn't it? - What'll you do with it? - Take it to the laundry. - It's fine, isn't it? - Yes, best possible weather. Oji-chan, this laundry? No, no. Then, what laundry? If you need, come to Koizumi's pawnshop Ne-san, bring me some tea. - Okimi-san, bring some tea. - Wait a moment. Good morning. You are early as always. Oji-san, "good morning" sounds funny at this hour. Kei-bo. We wake up late. You don't like that, do you? Kei-bo, you may like it better at sis Sugako's or sis Renko's than at our place. Which one do you like? I like aunt Sugako. I see. Sugako-san is good, but she's working for a company now. Let's go to Renko-chan. You'll like it there. The air is fresh. It's in the suburbs. There's an open field too. Would you like another dish? Good. Eat up. Kei-bo, the suburb is good, isn't it? Look Kei-bo. Renko-chan is so modern. Kei-bo, you like dogs, don't you. You'll have a great new friend. Hi, long time no see. This is great. He must have been very expensive. He cost around 1000 yen. Welcome. You must be successful. No, we borrowed it. Look. Ah, now I see. Please buy it. We'll pay 10% of the sale for the dog. Well planned. I thought you enjoyed luxury. Yes, a great luxury. You came at the right time. Oh, Kei-chan too? Picnic? Nice weather. I was going to visit you. You or Sugako sis. What for? You know. But, I'd have spent the train fare for nothing. So I hesitated. But you came anyway. Come in. Kei-chan too. - Dear, did you make the fire? - Yes, won't be long. Come on in. Kei-bo, shall we visit later? - Are you leaving? - We'll come again. To tell you the truth... we are quite penniless. We managed the cost of the oil paints somehow, but the gas was cut. We can make a fire with wood instead of gas. But, today or tomorrow, the electricity will go off too. We got notice from the company. He can paint in daytime, but a dark house is shameful with the neighbours. Maybe so. I wish there'd be a blackout for six whole months. Do you have anything? - How much? - For three months overdue. But I needn't pay it all. Just one month. I can negotiate very well. You've become a good wife. Because I married him for love. I won't complain. I've had to listen to love talk and now I'm asked for money. 1-yen 50-sen is enough. That's it! Dear! Our Saviour has appeared! Look! I'm sorry. No. Dear, you want a cigarette, don't you? No, I'm alright. Kei-bo, let's go back. Come in! No, we'll come again. We come again. Excuse me. Oji-san, where are we going to now? "Dedicated Servant" had some popularity. It had a good theme, skilfully and objectively described that hadn't been done before. Oh, it's rare to see you two here. Good to see you talented writers. Sweet talk! By the way, please write for us in next month's issue. I can't. I came here to decline. That's a big problem. Your further demand is forced labour. What's to be done? How many are you working on now? Seven for newspapers and magazines. I see. That's tough. Popular writers are cool to us publishers. However, we can't sell our magazine with unpopular writers. - Please help us. - Impossible. You have no sympathy. How about Hatoyama-san? Forgive me please. That's a dead end. Long time no see. How's it going? Sales work as always. I'm obsessed. I can't change my business. I see. It may be meddling, but I'll ask for you, Terada-san. Can I ask you for something? Come in please. Terada-san told me you and he are friends from the the private magazine age. - Let me see your manuscript now. - Thank you. Have you got the manuscript by Dr. Taniguchi? - I'll get it tomorrow, absolutely. - Are you sure? Here, "A Life with Scrofula" might be the best bet. Well, I think it's good. And, this "Madame Grasshopper"... it describes, well, how should I put it, the mental aspect inherent in women. - You caught her at last. - Yes, it was really hard work. - I'll write her story before deadline. - How about your stage? - I'm free till four. - Good. Anyway, I'll read them. This is for travel. No, sir. If you read it and it's worth publishing... No problem. Take this. It's my treat. No, sir. I couldn't. Give my greetings to Terada-kun. Why not? Take it. - I can't accept. - But you must take it. Hey, bro, take one. One more. I like the way you drink. No, sir, no kidding. Hey, take one. Thank you, sir, but no. Oh, sorry. Another bottle! Bring me another. Are you all right, sir? Don't worry. I have... l have it. No, I didn't mean it, sir. Are you a man, Matsuyama Kanzo? You've finally reached the end. Give me sake, more and more. Oh, my wife, my son, sorry for my sins. Watch out, sir. Where are you going? Well, you can't bring the toilet to me. Ochiyo-san, look after him. Oji-san, let me sing. - How old are you, boy? - Fifteen. OK, you can sing. Sing whatever you want. Thank you very much, sir. Oji-san will sing for you. Carried off by wind and wave I am writing as always the writing which cannot afford me a drink that I was doing, as deceived by wind and wave... Oji-san. Please wake up. Hey, where am I? Really! Where am I? Hiroko. Hiroko, it's me. Open up, please. Don't make such a racket. It's embarrassing, at this hour. - Didn't he come back? - Who? - Well, someone. - No one came. - Strange. - What's strange? Well, no. Strange. Dear, what did Sadako sis say? When you brought Keikichi to her. Well, no, nothing. Of course not. He's her own child. Smell that! Where have you been drinking? Don't worry. I can't go any decent place without money. Sake at those cheep street yakitori shops is no good for your health. You'll rot your brain. With or without cheap sake, you can't write a decent novel. Boy, did you make the fire well? You can't? Kozo? You can't do anything. Boy, you are very quiet. Oji-san, I am called Keikichi. I see. Keikichi. Yes, you are Kei-koh. Hey, no. You used my business tool for making the fire. Bad boy. Was it broken? A little out-of-tune but corrected if this sensei plays. Sera-san. Sera-san, Is Sera-san there? Renko-san. Oh no, Kanzo-san. I thought you were still asleep. No. It sounded like your voice but I couldn't imagine you would come so early. I thought you were the electric company man. Are you still afraid of the electric company? Yes, I had to use the money for the debt at the soba noodle shop. I can refuse to pay if I have nothing, but I can't if I have something. I'm not yet that well trained by hardships. So I just pretend to be out. Don't be so noisy. Staying indoors is tough. You have something. No, only two 50-sen and a lot of small change. Everywhere's the same. What brought you here today? Yesterday, on the way back home Keikichi disappeared. I'm looking around. I'm sure he must have returned home. No, I checked his home but he wasn't there. Hello. Dear. Boy, eat well. After your stomach's full, you can go back to your drunken uncle. You say you'll know once you get to Shibuya station. I'm free today. I can take you there. lshikawa prefecture, Maybe, this year will be good for persimmon trees. Boy, where is your local country? - Where were you born? - Tokyo. Oh, you are a Tokyoite. Village. I hope he won't be injured climbing a tree. Boy, how old are you? Eleven. You are one year older. Where are you sending the parcel to? This? It'll be snowing soon. So, a jacket for my son. Now, my wife in the village will feel easy. Boy, is it good? Not good? Have you become mute. What a strange boy. What was your name? Keikichi. Keiko hates to be called boy. Hey, Kei-koh. What's wrong? Don't cry. You are a boy. Don't be weak. Look, you can see Mt. Fuji. Can you see? Be brave. A man doesn't cry. If you don't cry when you want to, then you are a man. Us lower class have many problems which would drive us all to tears. But everyone forbears. Because we are men. If you want to cry, sing a song instead. OK? Oji-san can teach you a good song. You will forget about crying straight away. Look, the bamboo blowpipe plays a nice tune. Are you crying again? Are you laughing? Let's climb up. Hakone mountains are the steepest in the land Hakone mountains are the steepest in the land More so than Kankokukan, there's no comparison Kei-ko, you sing much better. High up in the ranges Look oji-san, we can see Mt. Fuji. Mount Fuji. You can see it, can't you? I'm back. What? He came again? - Did you come alone? - No. With mother? Who with then? Oji-san the shakuhachi player. What did you say? Who? Tell me. What's the matter? Come. Tell me who with? Strange boy. What a face. You look like your late father. Can't be affectionate. Such a boy. Hey, stop. Because you snap at him. I know you Kei-bo. Because, oji-san, drank sake and left me. Where? - Don't be so stupid. - Shut up! - Well? - After that I was taken by shakuhachi oji-san. Oji-san can buy something good for you. If you have any money we should buy a new shirt for our child. You care more for Kei-bo. What's that? You look guilty. Come on now! - Shut up! - What? Say that again! Of course that's because Sadako sis is so loose. But a woman can't be sensible even if she is over thirty as you'd expect. Her maternal affection has all gone? Maternal affection? No kidding. Why? It's the remark of someone who has a husband, like you. Huh, you are single but you know the mind of a thirty year old woman. Know or not, it's true. Does it reflect yourself? Hold on. Renko-chan too. She is as young as seventeen, but look at her now. She is just a child but plays the good wife. Maybe she makes a fool out of you. Makes a fool of me. When did you meet her? Last Sunday. She was totally changed. She's had hardships but, as a single woman I began to envy her. Don't envy Ren-chan. Get married yourself. I am what I am. Once the best marriageable time is over, there's no hope. I'm looking at three good examples, you know. I must act wisely. Take this. Among us four sisters, my nature is perhaps the poorest. - Maybe not. - Yes, I am. Look at me, with a lazy drunkard for a husband, in addition to bringing up such a baffling child. Don't be so sentimental. Yes, I am. No, I can't be bothered with it. Don't do such irritating jobs. That's why Renko-chan laughs at you. You are right. For once in my life I'd like to get a salary like you, Put some perfume on myself, even if it's a cheap one. - Don't be so sarcastic. - No, not at all. Since I've got a husband I've found out how clever a woman needs to be. A nice aroma. But Matsuyama-san is actually quite reliable. I doubt it. Dear, did you buy any beef? Yes, the price rose by 10-sen. They always do that. I'll leave now. You miss him after all. No way. He gets mad like an ordinary husband if I go home late. Thanks for your love talk. So, please take care of Kei-chan. Where is he? Kei-chan. Gee. He has the habit of wandering off. He's not been trained well. Where has he got too? Oh, Kei-chan. What were you doing? Looking at the Big Dipper. - Don't you feel cold? - No. Be a good boy. Come, look! Airplanes. Dear, wake up. Let me sleep late, it's Sunday. Kei-chan. Open the curtains. The weather's nice! Kei-chan, It's still early. The box. Let's eat. Give auntie some too. Kei-chan. Who do you like the best? Who? Tell me. Mother. Mother. Really? Who do you like, auntie? Who should I like? Oh, it's you. You surprised me. I must surprise you in your sleep, otherwise you might be out. - Come in. - May I? Why? Oh, yes, I have a guest. Your good man? Unexpected! Don't belittle me. That's why you're called a bad girl. Who's a bad girl? - Can I come in? - Please. Excuse me. Oh no, it's Kei-chan. - Suga-chan is a serious person. - You mean blockhead. Recently I began to envy you, Osuga-san. - Are you tired? - Tired of being poor. Help me. My place isn't a police station. Kei-chan came, you came. About the matter of Kei-chan, talk with Sadako sis. Can you really talk to her? And you help me, please. Take as many as you like. I can't help it. You won. I'm back. Why? Bro. Oh, it's you . Hiroko sis told us to take Kei-bo and go see what's going on. I see. Then you can leave Keikichi. I've nothing to tell you about my business. Are you mad? I'm not angry but, are you really my sisters? You look well after your bath, sis. Meanwhile you leave your child in your sister's hands. - That's enough. - Leave me. I want to speak. - Say whatever. - Yes, I will. Kei-chan stayed at my place last night. The day before he was taken care of by a shakuhachi player. At Hiroko's, the couple started fighting. Why not send him to an orphanage or somewhere? - That's enough. - No. Hello. Let's leave. Hello. Thank you. Be quiet. You enjoy tormenting your mother. Don't you? Papa! Papa, present? Fool, he's oji-san, not papa. Oji-san. But he's called papa... Noisy. Go out and play. Brother's a fool. Give me the medicine. In the drawer. Dear. Here you are. It's no use worrying. What are you thinking so deeply about? It never rains but it pours. But you thought it was good, so it's not your fault. You can restart again. You do have a future. - Cheer up. - Enough. Attention! Tazaki-kun. Go to the caretakers room. I'm sorry for bothering you, sir. What? Kei-chan, come. What is it? Mum. Mother... just for a while... must go to Kyushu. Oji-san's business has failed. He's in big trouble. It's only for a short while. So go to auntie Hiroko, with this letter. Me? Baby sit Shin-chan. For a short while. Be a good boy. Do you understand? This time... I can't take you, Kei-chan. Is it far? Yes, it's far. But, mother will come back soon. This letter is important. You see? Now, go back to the class room. Mother will send you something good. My school. Will I be absent from school again? Yes, but ask auntie if you can go a school near her house. Don't you think aunt Hiroko would tell me to go home? Did she tell you to "go home"? No. No, she didn't. You see? You're alright. Besides, Kanzo oji-san is a friend of Kei-chan.
