Damn it! One, two, three cars... Absolutely useless. What's wrong? What happened, driver? Why stop? Sir, a vagrant is lying unconscious on the ground He must be a miserable fellow with no money Driver, put him in the car You know it's my duty to serve humanity He is unconscious. It looks as if he hasn't eaten a thing. He may be love sick He looks like a... - Driver fast to the hospital O God! Save my soul. Doctors want only to operate So you were faking it, pretending, eh? I was completely worn out. I didn't have train fare Driver, stop the car! Blasphemy! Fake! Get out of the car! As you please. You were kind a minute ago Does he suffer from fits? How dare you! Do you know who you're talking to? Seth Dharamanand I don't have any sympathy for your sort If you want to reform, swear that you won't lie or cheat And you'll speak only the truth On the contrary, if you lie, you drive in a huge car Soft hands apply eau-de-cologne Speaking the truth you suffer Driver, let's go. He looks like a crook Seth Sonachand, if I'm a crook, a 420... ...You're... Bombay 420. Let's go, old pal My shoes are Japanese. My trousers are English. The cap on my head is Russian but my heart is Indian. I venture into the big, wide world I walk with my head held high Where does my destination lie, where will I ever settle? The Creator up above us only knows Like true soldiers, we forge ahead Up and down, round and round... ...flow the eternal waves of life Foolish are those who sit on the side lines With little care for their country's fate To forge ahead is like life, To stop still is like death There may be many a prince, many a ruler I am like a prince, just as spoilt I sit on the mighty throne Whenever I feel in the mood Cry the crowds in amazement: He looks very familar The cap on my head is Russian but my heart is Indian. Alms! Is Bombay filled with only deaf people? Only the deaf live here. - And the blind People in Bombay hear the jingle of coins This is Bombay, Bombay High buildings are made of cement. People have hearts of stone Only one thing is sacred, that's money Move aside. It's time for business Business? You mean work? That's what I'm looking for. What can I do to earn my keep? Do what I do... beg! Tell me, what kind of work can I find? Let me think it over. Are you educated? B.A. passed. Look at my degree. I have it here. Reliable? I have a medal for honesty, a gold medal Can you work hard? - 24 hours a day. No jobs here No jobs? No work even for someone educated? Why? Because this is Bombay. It's a big city If you look for work, you'll never find it If you live by lying and cheating there are 420 ways Thank you, boss. I've learnt a lot today How much are these? - Don't touch 8 annas a dozen, 2 annas for 3 What? Eight annas a dozen or two annas for three Two annas for three. No, three annas for two. 3 annas for 2. It isn't free. How will I survive? Take them at 2 annas for 3, or get lost. Why do you insist? 3 annas for 2 No way! 2 annas for 3 Think it over Two annas for three Three annas for two He must be nuts Come over here You want 2 for 3 annas? Here... Now we're talking Oh yes, the money... I don't have any Some other time, but remember 3 annas for two Here, pay me later What if I never pay? I'll think my son ate them How old is your son? - He's of your age. Thank you. You won't misunderstand? You don't have bananas but a heart of gold I'll pay He really is nuts, so naive Like a banana? Don't throw the skin anywhere. Some don't care about others They peel the banana and they fling... ...it anywhere Uncouth people eating bananas and throwing the peal anywhere. What nonsense! - This is Bombay Everyone laughs at others When they slip themselves, they stop laughing You're right, brother Tell me. Is there a pawn shop in the area? It's over there. Everything is sold and bought Vidya, you've come to collect your earrings? No, I've come to sell these bangles as well The school isn't running well? Get the money from the cashier. Keep them. When you have the money, return it Who knows? Maybe I won't ever see that day Why talk like that? It saddens me One day, a prince will come into your life He'll be handsome and rich. When he sees you, he'll be yours And then he'll marry you. He'll shower you with jewellery Then you can return all you owe me in one go Take the money. Greet your father. I'll visit on Friday What is it? What can I show you? Nothing to buy, something to sell That's exactly what they all say What is it? - Honesty What? - I'll sell honesty Here it is Rashtriya Orphanage Honesty Medal How much will I get? If honesty is sold, what's left in life? Did you say something? - No, nothing Uncle, I'll be off You pawning it or selling it? I thought I'd sell it It's always been with me. I'll sell it and be done with it Maybe someday... Forty rupees. To get it back, pay 50 Now you watch! With these 40 rupees, I'll buy Bombay That's what everyone thinks. But no one can buy Bombay. Bombay buys everyone. Everyone ends up right here I've got money Here's a 2 rupees Show! I'll pay 5 rupees. I have it here. My money! Who's taken it? You scoundrels! 420's! Crooks! Thieves! You play cards and you rob decent people Aren't you ashamed? Where do you think you're going? Can't you see this is reserved? Go away! Would you mind if I slept here tonight? Pay a shirt. - No shirt I've a Russian cap instead. - Don't you get it? A deposit! I mean money, cash I paid 3 rupees. Pay half and stay Rs. 1.50? That much just to sleep here? - Yes, 1.50 What do you think? Even a dog has to pay to sleep here This footpath is specially very soft Next door to Seth Dharmanand When he sits to dinner and the air blows here... Ah, the aroma! I don't have money even to buy poison. Let me sleep here tonight. - You are not home. Why involve my family? Well, what will you do if I sleep here? What are you doing? Picking on him as he's alone May I ask if this pavement is yours? No one owns this footpath, this is a side-walk It belongs to the State Hello, lady banana seller - How come you're here? What's going on? - Nothing, really... I was walking and felt tired so I sat down These brothers were looking after me. Were they beating you? What were they up to? Bravo! Hitting the poor boy. Did they hurt you? Where do you live? Where do you sleep? Nowhere. Where do people who live nowhere, live? Right here. Stay with us on the government's pavement. Listen everyone, regard him as our son Take good care of him. Treat him well. Help him. You'll stay here. - This footpath is our domain Sit comfortably Bring tea and snacks. Don't forget the chillies Forgive me if I hurt you. - It happens, you know Don't worry. Ganga Ma's children are like brothers I'm like your brother, what's your name? I told you all once, our day would come Our Raj is here What do you do for a living? I'm looking for work. What a job that is! You seem to be new here, that's why you look for work Or else you'd have fun like us What do you do? Jobless! Our stories can be told in a single word: jobless. Tell us your story. Where are you from? If we're to be as one, tell your story. Tell us something exciting, I feel sad today O gently people, hear this story A simple story with no frills, aimed to give many thrills I was once a boy of a poor family... ...who inherited his mother's destiny Grief and suffering were my childhood friends Pain and breath did blend Alas! With a face such as mine A thief and I look one of a kind' On the street, one day, for no rhyme or reason An officer took me away An officer Peered over his spectacles He looked me over barring no obstacles Said he: Can you see no more He's the warden's brother-in-law I'm still bound by misery I'm happy but not in ecstasy My destination lies before me. My feet are tied for all to see Rich folk hinder the fun Heed me but tell none Don't walk with head down Don't sing without rhyme. Don't shout without reason Or you will end up in prison! Why were you sleeping here? - Sir? The problem is, I had a row with my wife She threw me out of the house You know the women of today are like men Get lost. Is this a place to sleep? Get lost. Go on! He must be a newcomer. He's nuts What are you doing? Can't you see? Why are you doing that? To see this wretched world you have to look at it upside down All the leaders of the country do the same thing Then, they see it right Behave yourself or I'll straighten you out Constable, is this a crime? Get along You broke the castle Some people are like that, they can destroy, not build They sell honest and sin What must they do? Drown! I agree Hey you! Wait, Stop! Were you trying to commit suicide? What? Me? Committing suicide? Yes, suicide - You mean suicide? You said that people like me should drown That was... I mean, I'm sorry You're right, people like me should drown. It's a sin to commit suicide You won't will you? - Of course, I will It's the last sin. So what if you saved me? Listen, I won't let you commit suicide. Can you stop me, if I want to take my life? I'll call the police to stop you He's... - What are you up to? I'm up to something, but will she agree? He... - Let me tell you, come this way She's the one - Your wife? Absolutely She's pretty Don't get taken in by her face, she's poison She jumped into the sea, I had to get her out She says: I'll drown and take you with me She refuses to go home So that's it? I'll fix her You'll save a mariage from breaking up What is it? - Go home Where? - Home You, too - As you say, Constable Come, let's go Don't be cross What are you saying? Who are you to order me? Hear that? She says who am I to order me? Tell her who I am Go home or else to the police station Why? What have I done? - Committing suicide But I was... She says she dived in save me Not another word from you. Go home Why bicker like children? Wives should not leave their homes like that You're of the modern generation. A woman is a home's goddess. Each Indian woman should regard her husband as a god. That's enough! This is my home. Now go Have you started again? Get inside. You're still following me? I see you home, and you say I've no manners Vidya? What is it? - I've had it! Father I will tell him You can't go inside - Why not? Let me meet him Who are you arguing with? - She is arguing with me, father. Who are you? - He's... Shri. Ranbir Raj - My father, Pandit Omkarnath Shastri He dived into the sea - Into the sea Tell her not to jump into such deep waters Don't interrupt, I'm talking. Luckily... ...I was there Or else, she would have been I didn't jump in - Don't play with life That's what I said too, our life is given by God To misuse it is ungrateful He jumped in... - Change your clothes I'll sit for a while. Be careful or you might catch pneumonia He's right. Go and change your clothes Serve some tea to our guest Sit down. Thank you, my son. You've done me a favour She's all I have in the world It was my duty. - Who helps anyone these days? You risked your life for her. To jump in the sea is simple. I can swim for miles It's a pity that my expensive suit got wet Hurry with tea, he might catch a cold You're cheerful You put yourself to such bother The tea is hot, be careful Liars burn tongues Did you burn yours? Not my tongue, but my heart You're a very funny fellow. Hurry, Vidya The kids are waiting Hers? - She has fifty Fifty, my God! Father, I'd better go We have a small school - A school? I see! Since I've been paralysed, Vidya has run the school We live on little. The poor live here We are poor, too. We have nothing better to offer you. We don't have even a comfortable chair for you to sit. It's first class. Don't let it worry you Be careful! Are you hurt? Don't worry It isn't your fault. I've put on a little weight. One little seed, two seeds Seed on seed On the roof the girl dances, The crazy boy takes his chances Guess! Pomegranate There lived a little girl called Lalbai She wears a red skirt that a pie She burns your mouth and she makes your cry Have a guess! A chilli! It's green and It's surrounded with pearls Deep in the garden of the king it sways and whirls Its hair is quite wild and filled with curls Guess! Corn! It's a creature with money spread on its tail' It wears a crown on its head like a sail It dances full of glee, Full of joy in a gale. Guess! A peacock! One little seed, two seeds Seed on seed Though it's quite out of sight, It stays close and near It eats, it drinks, have little or no fear Don't fall into its snare, Be careful, be wise, beware Guess! Misery! No! It's me! Did you see? She lost her own game. Teacher lost the game She lost! Celebrate with a holiday. Go home Sit down all of you! Come back! Or you will be in for it Uncouth, illiterate! Letting them go Why get so cross? Let them have some fun Fun and game, eh? To be useless like you? True, I don't have any work but... ...illiterate... ...I'm not. That's the tragedy If I were, I would be a labourer What can I do? I am a graduate That's an even bigger lie! Look at you. Do you look educated? My appearance fools you If I were dressed grandly and had a car... ...You wouldn't have called me illiterate I don't blame you. The world is not compassionate Clothes make a man Fine clothes are more imporatant than human sentiments That isn't true. We aren't rich. You see, poor people live here It's shameful that the poor forget the poor Seeing how scruffy I look, one may assume I'm uneducated. So I carry my diploma with me Look... I am a graduate. B.A. passed I am very sorry I don't understand why you dress and behave like a clown You've got to stand on your head to see the world straight. The mask of a clown is just the thing you need If you ask me, the best way to hide one's suffering is to don... ...the mask of a clown. It's very useful Stay longer. - Is Panditji in? Can I help you? - Thank you, Vidya If I need help, I'll come to you. Right now I want to help myself My destiny beckons me What does your fate have in store for you? Whatever I do, whichever path I tread... ...you'll see, I'll become famous and rich No one will look down on me I shall command respect and admiration. Long live Dharamanand Bombayities, accept my greetings Hindus: Ram Ram, Muslims: Salam Morning to Christians and Sat Sri Akal to Sikhs You all know the importance given to religion and culture Friends, look at my clothes From head to foot I am dressed in clothes made in India Gentlemen, look at me! My shoes are Japanese, my trousers are British My cap is Russian, but my heart is Indian Let me repeat, the one thing that's Indian is my heart Our greatest problem is... Bread! Bread! Chapatis, nan, idli, dosa Whatever you call it, bread is most essential. Do I lie? - No, It's the truth The problem of bread is one of the soul and peace of mind You cannot find peace of mind if you go hungry That's right! Many cloud over real issues like history and religion Putting emphasis on... bread Brothers who want to eat real bread, come to me To swallow air, go over there Silence! Brothers and Sisters! Heed the call of time, the call of truth Listen! Come to me, lovers of bread No one is better equipped to solve this I will ask you one thing... What is required to eat bread? Money? - That's it. Bravo! One thing's more important than money. You can deceive others You can beg, borrow or steal for bread But you can never eat bread without... TEETH! Yes, brothers, teeth! Is that clear to everyone? If your teeth are not strong, how can you chew properly? It will lead to indigestion... weakness and disease This will end up by weakening the entire nation Then enemies can invade and conquer us, making us slaves If you want to keep India free and the nation stronger... Preserve your teeth! Brush them with my invention: SUN AND MOON TOOTH POWDER Teeth will sparkle like the moon, the sun Four annas each! - A bottle for me Let's get in line Someone's selling Tooth Powder. I see... a 420 Your teeth may be hurting, too. Why not try that powder? Tell us something, what's the powder made of? Does it contain crushed bones? There's only coal and sand from Chowpatty in this Did you hear that? He's been cheating us Instead of powder, he's selling sand. Hit him! Where did they hit you? Well, what do you think you are doing? It hurts. - You deserved what you got Stop it or you'll singe him Tell me what the problem is He was selling sand as tooth-powder, he asked for it He won't easily forget the thrashing he got Why laugh? Tell me son, since when have you started racketeering? What else can I do, Ganga Ma? - Drink it up while it's hot Rest for a few days. This is your home Call it a footpath, not a home He's crazy. If we have a footpath, we'll have a home Raj, you're educated. Tell us it can be possible One day, our government will build us homes Fine homes It's possible that like us will have homes How shall we pay the rent? For anything one must have a job A worthwhile job - Listen! I was working in a laundry. I was paid 45 rupees a month The owner cut 20 rupees because I burnt a cloth. Is that fair? I spit at honest work You left the job? But why? I was fed up. I quit You won't go back? I'll find work Where did you work? - At the Jai Bharat Laundry Have you worked in one? I worked at the Sunlight Soap factory, I mean laundry I can't tell you how well I wash clothes Do you have an iron? A wife? How can I? I don't have a job or a house. I didn't say a 'wife', but an iron! I thought you said a 'Wife'. About the ironing, sir... I'm from a line of washermen You look a clown. Can you work hard? Yes, Sir! Will you be honest? - Yes, Sir. You've got the job. You'll be paid 45 rupees. Start now. Ram, how is it spelt? - R... A... M Raj, how is it spelt? - R... A... J Once, again, children! I am sorry, I can't understand you Why do you dress like this and act like a clown? Who is it? Oh, it's you! How are you? I came to give you this Why did you take the trouble? - It was my duty. How is Panditji? How are you? I've some news. I have bought a laundry It's in Parsi bazaar. To get there walk... ...just left of Kharsi Parsi If you feel like it, come visit I got a new suit I couldn't visit earlier, I'm so busy at work At last, I found a spare moment today I am very busy. It's late. I'll go now. I thought I just saw you putting on a coat Fooled by appearance Clothes are tailored for human beings and not vice-versa I don't understand. - Look The dress... The man. What do you say? I came to see how your laundry is doing Very well. 15 or 20 people work here I'm the boss We eat and drink well I didn't wear the suit. It may get spoilt in the rain. What will you have? Where will you have tea? At the Taj or at the Greens? They're too far away I'm very tired as well The local footpath Palace Hotel. It isn't very far Here's the footpath restaurant. Limited furntiture Make yourself comfortable, I'll be back Two special teas, with milk and sugar... double the tea And the unpaid bills? You don't seem to see the delicate predicament I'm in Please wait until I get paid. Look who's here with me. Why should I care? You already owe me 6 rupees 10 annas Please understand Let me have some tea, my honour's at stake At least, Pay for today's order Taste Uncle's tea, you won't go else where Have you got two annas? - You mean some change? I've no change for a hundred and uncle never has any either Right, Uncle? Can I ask something? If two decent young people fall in love... They should marry, right? When they marry, they must have children They will need a home and clothes to dress the children Later, the children must be sent to school I earn only rupees 45 at the laundry How can I dream of a marriage life on 45 rupees, tell me? A man alone cannot do it, but if both of them work together You mean... Vidya, you and I? I'll come to talk to your father tomorrow We're in love, We know it's passion Why are our hearts filled with apprehension? My heart warns me the path ahead isn't easy Little do we know where we go Our destination is hazy. Assure me no change will enter our love's rhyme. Assure me you'll not change with passing time One day, if you're no longer mine The moon will no longer shine Each night will be filled with our story The youth of tomorrow will sing our melody Neither you nor I will remain But the tokens of our love will reign. Constable! It's you. Is your wife still angry? Wife? The iron! Oh Lord! Fire! Water! Fetch some water! Hurry up, bring the water! What's going on? What's the matter? What's this nonsense?

Vidya You don't need the wisdom of Vidya Today, you need the wealth of Maya Don't look back, don't think of the past As you journey through life, you are not alone I stand right beside you Our destination is clearly before us The clouds are like waves, rolling past us The caravan of life never stops Don't look back, don't think of the past As you journey through life, you are not alone I stand right beside you Look everyone straight in the eye Smile with each passing season The world is his who looks ahead The world is his who adapts to the times The world is his who fits the mould The world is his who forges on Come outside! Stop being a child Leave this world of morality and piety See the world as it really is Do you know who I am? I'm but a slave You're drunk The world thinks that I am drunk Laugh! It's such a happy occasion Laugh at the humiliation I suffered I have never been humiliated before. What'll they think? Whatever they want to What good has the world done for me? Why care? This world did not care when I was starving This world did not provide work when I was jobless When I was homeless it gave me no shelter. Vidya, you'll see. They will respect me They will respect me well All because of this... Money! Respect! Fame! Luxury! A life of luxury. A new life for you and for me For both of us You have stolen, you have robbed A sleight of hand. One card moves from here to there You cheated at cards. Cheated! Its fruit is bad. - See the bad fruits, then You are chasing paper One day, a storm of fate will blow it all away You'll grovel in a pool of corruption Raj, don't fall into this trap. Don't be corrupted Tell the others who build empires on fraud Through fraud they make millions They rule the world Sermons and advice about honesty are given to the poor Keep working hard, slog away Eat the dry bread of honesty and thank God for your lot How you have changed! You came in ragged clothes and I took you for a prince Forget that old Raj. Forget him What's past is past. Don't look back We're entering a new world. Will you stand by me? You live in a new world now where everyone is for sale. But I'm not for sale, do you understand? Very well, then I'll leave Remember, you and others like you who laud honesty... ...will perish with hunger I won't starve. I have money, I have wealth O beloved for my sake Don't break my heart this way I implore you Look back once before you leave If you must leave, look back once before you go You've left me with a broken heart. Don't forget me Although I remain silent, my eyes implore you Don't let me fall away let a tear from your eye Welcome, Raj Kumar Sahib of Piplinagar Why do you hesitate? Come inside Are you ready to start work? Thank you. What do I have to do? Work? If you had to deliver a thousand tons of rice? Only 800 tons? There's no need to panic. If you can't find rice... ...then you can find 200 tons of bricks Get it? I'm starting to understand I shall have to find work for you Absolutely! It must be something that is of interest to people What do people want most in life? People want to get rich overnight Win at the races or at cards or in gold mining Can you turn dirt into money?

Let's start business, I'm in the same trade Give me 50 shares 50 shares...? - I'll buy more later The demand for shares is rising. You can have 20 How can you do this? As this company is Indian, you should give us priority Who am I doing this for, anyway? Not more than 20 shares Have 5000 and give me the fifty shares It feels like we've known each other for years You're forcing me into this Get the certificates from Cashier May I give you some advice? Start mining in Tibet With your blessings, I already have No, learning and knowledge cannot be sold Uncle, you can't keep helping us. - Why do you say that? I heard you're getting married soon. Then your luck will turn Uncle, that isn't it - What is it, then? Panditji told me you liked a young man, what happended? Did he turn out to be bad? - No, it's my luck that's bad. You're lucky.

It's terrible. Can I help? Thank you. Open a school with your own money And teach them how to buy honesty Mister, your honesty! Take your honesty with you It's you? - Me? What is it? - You! You look splendid! Your white collar, your bow-tie, your suit, very handsome You've found the way to become a big man. Now, you're happy What is the matter? Aren't you happy? No. Raj, I'm very sad What's happened? You know I'm not a big man Raj, where have you disappeared to? Raj! Raju! Vidya, you're very late today Take this No uncle, I don't want any tea Why not? You're my regular customer I don't even have two annas. - So what? Many 420s drink their tea here and never show up again You haven't been here for ages Don't you look grand? Sit down, I'll bring tea Wait, Vidya. I want to tell you something But I don't want to listen - You have to listen. Sit down Special tea for you Do you remember... ...the day we had tea together? We made promises to each other. We dreamt a dream I told you we'd have a home We would send our children to school. I'm trying to make it come true Do you have to do it dishonestly, through fraud? Try and understand. I'm not as bad as you think. I cheat those who cheat others Don't pity them If I pity anyone, it's you Do you know where this path will lead you to? You wanted me as your wife You'll end up in jail, whose wife will I be then? You wanted your children to go to school You know what they'll say? Their father is a crook Think about it. How can people like us manage without money? One can't breathe without it Money! Money! Money! Raj, what have you done? Why did you do it? You have shattered our dreams of a home Tell me if I have harmed you. Why did you do it? You've been tempted by all false world, by clothes, by cars Tell me, Raj You've lost everything for a sham world You've sold yourself to a tinsel world. Go back And buy the love you need. I've given my heart to you. Only to you Your eyes sparkled with the light of passion Your eyes never glinted with greed nor treason You were another, you were not the same Your spirit was pure your heart inflicted no pain Little does it matter if I regret or suffer in vain In your new world, in your universe... in exchange of gold hearts are bought, hearts are sold In our world, under the tree of sorrow Hearts skip a beat at the mention of love Under the moon and starts the night in song flows I've given my heart to you, only to you. I've given my heart to you, only to you. Memories haunt me, with a sweet pain I never learnt how to console my grieving heart Little does it matter, if you don't return, if you forget I have not learnt how to love and then to forget Even from that faraway place, just tell me once: I've given my heart to you, only to you. I've given my heart to you, only to you The path is the same, the traveller is the same But I wonder where a shining star has disappeared to? The world is the same, people are the same Little do they know a life has been plundered Who will stay in my heart? Who will say to me: I've given my heart to you, only you Long live Raj! Didn't I tell you, one day Raj will be back? Then we'll have our own homes. - My son is back We thought you forgot us One who lived on the footpath, won't forget friends made there Tell us when our homes will be ready Homes? - Your advertisement created a stir Advertisement? Yes brother, look here A home for a hundred rupees NO MORE PAVEMENT DWELLERS. NEWS FOR THE HOMELESS PEOPLE'S COLONY FOR ONLY 100 RUPEES SIGNED RAJ KUMAR. C/O SETH SONACHAND Long live Raj! Seth Sonachand, who placed this advertisement? Why did you leave the hotel? Maya was most upset You shouldn't have let Maya down A home for 100 rupees? You did this. Who'll believe it? How can you build one? Which idiot told you we intend to build homes? I am not selling houses. I am auctioning a dream You know how many people sleep on the footpath in this city? All of them hope for one thing: A home of their own Understand? So even the poorest... ...among them will manage to collect 100 rupees So that we can build them a home Seth Sonachand, I did everything under the sun to help you I cheated at the futures market, sold bogus shares You want me to cheat the poor to make you rich In this world we should not make any distinction... ...between the poor and the rich. No preferences Do you think I'll do this? What choice do you have? Who was the one who agreed to cheat in the first place? You did Who floated the Raj, Raj, Raj, Company? You did Take back your money. Take everything I want peace of mind I don't want to work with you, do you hear? Do I build castles in the air? I can do away with you, like that Do you realise that each share has been signed by you? Do you remember I was the first man to buy 50 shares? I'll be the first to sue you. Under Section 420 No Raj, you cannot get out easily Whatever Vidya said was right On that path you don't need Vidya, but Maya Why? Have you become scared? You're running away now Running where? To that worthless school teacher Nonsense! I don't understand what you see in that girl I've seen dozens like her A dime a dozen What rubbish you talk! - Don't get angry Witch! Aren't you ashamed to speak of her like that? I'll kill you Hit me as much a you like Remember, you will never have the ideal wife Such women are not for you I'm the only one who will accept you. Why are you sad? You once worked in a laundry, now you have everything Money, fine clothes, a car, a house to live in Wealth? Home? Name? Luxury? Everywhere I go, I'm called 420 Remember something Raj, those who remain petty thieves... ...are called crooks. They are treated with disdain To be a crook, join the big time Be like Sonachand, play with millions No one will dare to call you 420 You will be called a philanthropist, a pious man A big shot A young man like you can do many things Today, Sonachand exploits you for his ends If you want, you can double-cross him You're right, that's exactly how it's going to be HOMES FOR PEOPLE! How many houses? Around 114,557 people have been registered Over twenty million Bravo, Raj! You are a genius I am nothing before you. Your genius works through me What's this racket? Who are they? They are all partners who have contributed to the construction They are anxious that we start work We shall make an announcement today To see people so enthusiastic frightens me Frightened? Shall I return their money? Some men are here to register their names Tell them to return tomorrow Have they cash? Let them in I do not know how to refuse money Go to your room.

Take this Here's 225 rupees It's their savings, make them a home Make up the difference with her wedding ornaments Add all this up and make them a home Don't you want a house for yourself? You worry about all Why bother about myself? I'll stay with one of them Are the homes relly being built? Whatever you want will really happen You must be busy, we'll go Give us a house! - God bless you! Be ready Raj, I have made all the arrangements I am going away, far away Take out the money from the safe, here is the bag They must be anxious to collect their share Seth Dharamanand and his friends have everything set for you You will get only 20,000 and the air-ticket He'll announce that Raj has run with the money I have arranged everything Give me the bag - Can I come in? I came here... Vidya, you? I hear you are building homes Do you want one? What use is it to me? It's up to a man to make a house into a home Why are you here? Can't you see we are busy? I have a present for you Here... The medal for honesty you pawned It may come in use Honesty! A gold medal? Honesty? It is sold at Rs. 80 a gram What you get is not honesty What are you looking at? Give me the bag, hurry This money is not yours. - It is yours It's not mine, either. - Then whose it is? Nonsense! Here's the passport, the air-tickets, a taxi's waiting We'll soon be far away from India Far from the police and Sonachand I can escape from the police and Sonachand... ...but I cannot escape from myself So you plan to run away with the money All the doors are closed You want this money? We must distribute it All this money, every cent, including a counterfeit coin And the jewels of a lady who dreamt of marrying How will you distribute it? If you can, then here it is Is this place a maze? Where are you taking it to? It is my money Traitors! I raised you from the gutter and made you rich And you defy me? My money! The bag! - Let go! You are a cheap dancer I am Sonachand speaking. There are thieves in my house Wait! You can't escape Raj, we have got you You have had it. - Stop talking rubbish! Hand me the money. - Give it to me You bicker for a mere trifle You want it? Take it! Men descended from the apes but money has turned them into dogs These are only papers. The money? Traitor! - Treachery! Only waste paper The notes you were fighting for are only made of paper, too For this paper you are capable of nothing. To get it, you cheat people. Collect bogus insurance claims I am taking the proof of your crimes. It's the end for 420s Today, I will expose you all The world will... ...know your benevolence and Seth's true colours Someone's shot Raju They have shot him! Who shot my son? Who fired? What happened? I shot him for the sake of each and every one of you He was running away with your money You don't know Raj, he was a real 420 All lies! You are lying Raj was not a crook, you made him into one When he first came to Bombay he was so good, so cheerful He wanted to work and you didn't give him work He had to live on the footpath and sell his honesty You taught him your evil ways If you want wealth, name and honour... ...then lie, play cards, dupe others and be a 420 You are the real criminals Nonsense! - Do you know who I am? Yes, she is absolutely right Raj was not a crook. You made him into one You old hag, if only you knew what kind of person Raj was Let the police get here Who fired? - I did Do you know who I am? - Yes, Seth Sonachand You all know that my first duty is to serve humanity He was absconding with the money of the poor For their sake, I shot him If that makes me a criminal, they hang me For the sake of the people I'll give my life Don't tell such a lie! I am still alive You did not die? No, Seth Sahib. Life itself is a 420 You perhaps forgot that I put the pistol in the bag And I loaded it What is this? Why this masquerade? In this nonsensical world one has to live by faking death Everything is ready To stop me, he fired 6 bullets. To stop a thief, one suffices Why six bullets? For the sake of the people? Or for the million? - What is this talk of money? That is exactly what I want to know. - Where is the money? Their money is where they put it Inspector, take this key. The money is upstairs in the safe Ask them why the people's money interests them? Fetch the money from upstairs and take Raj Sethji, all of you had better follow me Take a close look at these people. They are respectable They are rich They cannot be counted in one hand, they are 420s Not just a simple 420, but Mister 420 Look at yourselves Who will say you are poor, unemployed and homeless? Each of you has over a million rupees I have kept all your money safely I did not intend to cheat you. I wanted all of you to unite If you want, take back your money Don't waste such a vast fortune, don't disperse your strength How can you build a home with a 100? But with a million, yes Go to the government with this million Say we are a million people, we will build our own homes Look carefully at me I was one of you When I came to Bombay, I had everything I was honest and hopeful I hoped that I had be a big man And children whom I had to send to school I have lost everything May God bless the noble person who stopped me She showed me that the cure to poverty is not deceit The cure is hard work. That's the prosperity of the nation May God bless her. That is all I have to say May none of you make the same mistake Come on Mr Raj Let us go, old pal I venture into the big wide world, I walk with my head held high Where does my destination lie, where will I ever settle? The Creator up above us only knows Like true soldiers... - We forge ahead The cap on my head is Russian but my heart is Indian My heart is Indian
