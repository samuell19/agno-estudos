(gong crashing) - Hold it. No visitors. - I've traveled a long way. - Forget it. Come back some other time. - Okay, if you insist. - Pledge to our flag. - [All] May our founders bless us. - Leader, wanna say something? - As you all see, many have gone before us and died. We should fight while we're still young. If we fight and die, that is no sin. If they want a war, we'll go to war. We simply cannot live under such a corrupted government. They called us rebels, we are freedom fighters. I tell you, the Quing government will soon see we will not just keep waiting. With our determination they will know our love for country is strong, it is right. Let those who agree say yay. (all yelling) - Ah, yes, right. - Yay! (birds crowing) - Something is going on. - Yeah. It's me, it's me, come and see. The soldiers are on their way. (all murmuring) - [Man] Come on, let's go. - Stop it. Let her speak. Daughter. - Dad, first advisor, you take the men and go out the backdoor. - And you? - I will stay here and fight them. I'll meet up with you. - Hey, daughter, daughter. And you can handle them yourself? - Dad, there is no time to argue? - Okay, you all follow me. (all yelling) - [Man] Come on, come on, let's go. (swords clanging) (yelling and grunting) (heavy kicking and punching) (yelling) - Watch your step. Careful. (swords clanging) (yelling and grunting) - Get her. (yelling) (swords clanging) (all yelling) Men. Rebel girl, now we have done you in. Don't try to jump in. You come with us, then we'll forgive you all your crime. - Hmm. (grunting) - Guards, get her! (yelling and grunting) (swords clanging) Ready and aim. (arrows firing) (yelling) (sword clanging) (yelling) - Oh. Our leader's jumped off a cliff. (all murmuring) Hold it, hold it. - Listen, our leader says that you should go back to your hometowns and wait for further news. Protect your own family and wait for the order. Don't do anything stupid. - [Man] Okay. (all murmuring) - Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. The lord bless you. - Why did the soldiers suddenly attack us? - What happened today is very strange. We could've been betrayed by an insider. Let us go and talk to the leader, Xia Xiu. - Well, I'm going to go home first and shower and shave and gather up some more people, okay? - That's fine. - Goodbye. - Go. (all murmuring) - You too, come on, hurry up. Hurry up. - This young lady jumped off a cliff and now we don't know where she is. They have offered a reward for $10,000, dead or alive. Well, this was such a nice lady. Who would want to capture her either dead or alive. Yet those bureaucrats from the government, who waste our tax money on stupid pathetic things want to have her. They don't deserve somebody like that. Those crooks. Our president's nothing but a crook and I don't want to give her to him. What's he gonna do to her then? - Oh, she's so young and pretty and knows kung fu. - But she's a killer. - Hey, I told you. If I get her, I get rich quick, you know? That's a lot of money. - Now now now, this is a great girl. She hates the government just like we do. - Do you know where she is? - Nobody knows where she is. She jumped off the cliff. Maybe she's dead. - Ah. Any news of the girl? - Your honor, nobody knows where she is right now. We look all over the place for her, but we still can not find her. - She's a very sneaky girl. We have to try to find her somehow. - I don't think we have anything to worry about. She's not gonna get away from us. We have put people all over the custom gate. Hmm, she's gonna be ours very soon. - My lord, the master is waiting for you at the door to see you. - Come on and bring him in. I'd be glad to have him come. - Yes, my lord. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Please, come on in. Have a seat over there. - After you. - There. - Sure. - Marshall, why the sudden visit? - It's something very urgent. - Really? - Yes, it is. - Let me guess. It must be about the woman kung fu fighter in the white. Is it? - Yes, it is. We got the impression that she might be hiding out somewhere in this town. A couple days ago, the intelligence agents told us so. We got some leads that reward at the tic, the tac, and the dough of $10,000 and I'm not gonna easily give up. We're gonna take this case, ladies and gentlemen, and I tell you, we're gonna get her and the rest of the rebels with the help of an insider, somewhere within out organization. We're not gonna give up on this. - Well, it's great to know we do have an insider with us and that we do get by with a little help from our friends. (laughing) Once we get her, we'll be rich. - Let's build up our soldier force. Make sure that they're there 24 hours a day. Check each person before they go in or out of the city. (crowd murmuring) - Hurry up, hurry up. What's going on here? Come on, come on, hurry up. I don't have all day. Hey, come on, move it. Hey, go on. Hey, you. - That's for you. - May God bless you. - What are you doing? - We're just passing. - Passing? I'd be nicer then. I asked you what you do. - We've been poor people who go town to town. - Where you come from then? - [Vincent] From a swap meet. - [Guard] Swap meet? So, where you going now? - To go up north for handouts. - For handouts? - Yes. - Passing? - Yes. - You guys just go. - Thank you, yes. Let's go. - Who's next, who's next? Come on, hurry up. What's going on? Wait a minute. Put it down. - Yes, sir. (sword clanging) - Wait a minute. You guys go from town to town. You must've seen the rebel Lotus Clan and the white robe girl, haven't you? - We've seen even more. The rebel girl, her poison darts, her killings. Her followers are everywhere. - Ah, do you know where they are now? - She put up quite a show. I heard she was surrounded by our great soldiers and she jumped off a cliff. I think now she's fish food. - Ah, that's bologna. If she's really dead, do you think we'd give out a reward? - Well, sir, there's nothing I can do. (laughing) - I think that you are telling me a lie. (weapons clattering) - Thank you. - [Woman] Don't bother me anymore. - Hey, stay back, stay back, come on, come on. Get out of the way. - Get out of the way. - [Man] Get out of the way. - [Guard] Get out of the way. Come on, get out, get out. - Look, what's with him? - Yes, sir. Sir, I think he's checking two people from out of town. He was asking them where they come from and then he said goodbye to them. Now he's just stood there. I think he's just paying you some respect, sir. (hard slapping) - Stupid fool. (gasping) - Forgive me, my lord. - Who are they? - Two men. - He may be the one we're looking for. (light orchestral music) - Every time when I see this lotus, I wanna know how my mother is really. - I remember when I first saw the lotus with my own eyes. 20 years, I think it's been. - Dad, when we get there, like you said, do you think we'll find mother? - It's been a long time. Surely, I hope so. So, uh, I think it's time to go. - Uh-huh. - Let's go. Careful. Whoo, watch your step. - Ah, welcome, welcome. Have a seat, please. (laughing) - Na na na na na na. Welcome to Holiday Inn. Can I take your order? - Yes, I'll have a pan pizza. I like pizza, with anchovies, lots of them. - Right away, it's coming up. I've got an order for a pan pizza with everything, including the anchovies. - There you go. (suspenseful orchestral music) - All right, get this over here right now. Okay. (laughing) There it comes. There's your pizza and right now, breadsticks, and there's your stuff. And there's your chopsticks. And there's your water. Coming back. Let's go. - [Vincent] I like to eat pizza with my fingers, not these chopsticks. (eerie atmospheric music) - Pardon me, can you spare some change? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. (dishes crashing) (grunting) - Let's drink. - Cheers. (glasses shattering) - That's for you. - Oh, thank you very much. - [Woman] You're welcome. - You're very generous. Thank you. Oh, thank you. (men coughing) - [Man] Let's go home. * 99 bottles of beer on the wall * * 99 bottles of beer (laughing) Mind your step. - Not very safe. Let's get moving. - Mmm. (rooster crowing) - Ah, what a bummer. I know that she was just about to. - Ah, I thought they would be easy. Now it's too late. - Ah. - I noticed that at the restaurant there were only those two friends. - Maybe somebody's setting a trap for us. - Hmmm. Do you think they would put poison in our cups? - I'm finally beginning to think the same as you do. The nun was acting pretty strangely for some time. - See? They will not let us two alone. - No, they won't. They want to corner us. That's what I see. Do you think, do you think our group has gotten to the temple yet? - The temple's not far. That's where they should be. (bird cawing) (ominous orchestral music) - Let's get moving here. We're not going hiking. (birds squawking) Come on. - Dad, you see that now? Dad, the man was one of us. - Yes, I see. But why'd he get arrested? - He is one of our finest fighters. Maybe he was set up by someone too. - Uh, over there. - What now? Hmmm, you stupid or what? It's just a lousy bunny rabbit. And you're scared to death? Come on, let's go. (all murmuring) (sword clanging) Who are you? - [Charlene] Let him go. - Get 'em. (swords clanging) (yelling and grunting) (heavy kicking and punching) (heavy kicking and punching) (yelling and grunting) (groaning) (horse neighing) (heavy slapping) (grunting) (swords clanging) - Want to live, don't you? (horse neighing) - Of course, of course. - If you want to live, give your boss this message. Tell the jerks I'll be waiting for them at the temple. - Oh, my. Then they'll all come over. - Hmm. (arrow whipping) (grunting) (choking) (humming) - Look here, my lord. - [Man] Oh, yeah. What's up? - Some of our soldiers went down there. I don't know what's going on here. - Really? Hmm. Let's go check. Hmm? (moaning) What happened? - Five soldiers were killed and one wounded. - [Man] So who did this? - Well, we got one of the rebel girls' best fighter. The rebel girls came and ambushed us, killed all of us and took the prisoner away. - How many were there? - A man and a woman. - My lord, take a look at this. - Hmm. That looks like a poison dart. - I smell trouble, sir. That looks like the rebel girl's favorite weapon. I think she and the gangs have been here. - And that's how he died. Well, he may be in the temple. Hmm. - Let's go! (moaning) (humming) (grunting) - Oh, take it easy. Here, sit down. Tell me how you feel. - Except for my neck, I think everything is okay. I think they just roughed me up. - Yeah, well, you look like you've been roughed up. - How did they get you? - A few nights ago I was just walking around with my buddies. We were just hanging out. It was a secret. I don't know why the soldiers knew exactly where we are. (sighing) - I wonder how, how they would know where you are exactly. - Maybe there's an insider among us. - I have begun to think that way, but we must be very careful then. - To flush out the mole is easy, change our password and signals, tell all the others, and pretend nothing's wrong. - I can take care of that. - And then we must all go underground. - Mmm. - Unless I order, don't act on your own. - I'll warn the others that there may be an insider among us. You two, what will you do? - My daughter and I are looking for her mom. When we come out of hiding then, I just don't know. - Well, just, just hide in the temple. - Where then? - The Lotus Temple. - We'll go there. (gong crashing) (light orchestral music) - Welcome to our temple. What can we do for you? - Sorry to bother you. I am Vincent. Here's my daughter. We are traitors. We go to swap meets here in your beautiful town. We have no place to stay. I am wondering if we could stay here. If you would be so kind to let us. - Of course, there's no problem. You both can stay. Anything else you need, just let us know. Visitors are always welcome. - [Both] Thanks for your hospitality. - Just let me. * Amazing Grace * How sweet the sound * That saved a wretch like me - Mmm. * I once was lost - Where are you going? (laughing) - Just checking things out. - I know exactly what you're thinking about. (laughing) - Come on, honey. Now, just sit yourself down. Let's go. * Was Grace that taught my heart to fear * * And Grace, my fears relieved * How precious is that grace (clapping) - Good job. Oooh, your singing is beautiful. What's your name. - None of your business. - Hey, hold it. This is Mr. Young asking you. He's our landlord, you know? Answer him right away or else. - Get out of my way. (laughing) - This girl is one tough cookie. You know where she's from? - Uh, yes, my lord. She is one of the worker's daughter. - Mmm. Now I remember. Lumberjack Qui's daughter? - Yes, yes. - Ah. Mmmm. (banging) - [Worker] Okay, thank you. - [Man] There you go. - Thank you. - Uh. - Here, man. - Thank you, thank you. - Mmm. Mmm. - There you go. - Oh, yeah. Hi friends, fortune telling right over here. If I can not predict the future, then you get it for free. - [Customer] So what I like drink? - [Fortune Teller] Ah, you must like whisky. - Fortune telling. Tell your man I hate whisky. I like gin. If I were you, I would just go away from here. Let's go. - [Fortune Teller] Hey, come on. Just one mistake. (laughing) - One mistake. You make me sick. - Ah, here is your tab. - Thank you. - Your tab, man. - [Lumberjack] Oh, my tab? - Hey, hey. - Hey, wait. That old man tripped. - Yo, what up brother, you okay? Let me gather this mess, man. Let me get you out the hood and get you back to where you belong. Come on, yeah. Get out my way, man. This guy needs to sit down and have a little bit of a break here. There you go. You gonna be okay, man. See, I told you you should be retired by now. You see, Master Young likes your daughter. Just say yes to him and it'll get you a lot of m-- - Don't listen to him. - Get back to work. Ha ha ha, even you can tell that this is gonna be a wonderful deal. Just think about it. You'll be even richer than Ed McMahon, with over 10 million dollars if you just simply retire from your job. Ha ha. Heh, listen very carefully. Even the blind wouldn't pass up this opportunity. Think about it. Come on, think about it. - Dad, we've been waiting here for days. There's still no news. Do you think everything's okay? - Um, it's hard to get information. Maybe he has to wait a while. - I wanna go out on my own. - Go out? It's not very easy to get in. Let dad go and check it now. - I know my way. Just let me go this time, okay? * Let me see * Let me be * Let my fortune come to me * One for young, one for old * When will this conflict end * How come my password is not working * * Maybe they know my undercover * * How come this song is so lame * * Why don't I ever know how to rhyme * I thought the ying-yang was for surfwear. (suspenseful orchestral music) Do they really know that I'm undercover? How come I just couldn't contact her? (murmuring) - Mmm. Tell me, what did you find out today? - There is a fortune teller in the lumber yard. Never seen him before. - Oh, is he suspicious? - He looked strange. Keeps looking around and checking us out. I think he's a Lotus rebel if you ask me. - So, tell me, have you seen the rebel girl lately? - Not yet. I don't think she's around here yet. - She's disguised as fortune teller. - No way. Let's not rush it, okay? Let's just follow him. Let's not be hasty. (gate squeaking) (digital beeping) (swords clanging) (grunting) (yelling and grunting) (all yelling) - Come on, hurry. Come on, hurry. - What's going on here? What's all this noise? I was sleeping. Come on. Do you know who she is? - Hey, guards. Take off her bandana. - [Guard] Yes, sir. (tile crashing) (screaming) (all yelling) - Go inside now. - Get him. (all screaming) (gun firing) (grunting) - [Charlene] Are you okay? - [Rebel] Let's go. - Listen. - Yeah. - You'll get 'em right away. - Alrighty then, let's go. (heavy breathing) - [Charlene] You've been shot. Come on, let's get out of here. (dog barking) - I can't believe that she was throwing things at me. I'm glad it's not some bird doo or some cow chips or something. - Yes, my lord. We've searched the place inside and upside down. We still can not find them. - I can't believe this stupidity. You tell your crazy fools to keep looking. - Yes, lord. - [Rebel] Let's sit here a little while. - Ah, how could this be? - I've been shot. I need some help. Please take me to the doctor. I can't let anyone know who I am. Please take me back to the temple first. (light flute music) - Here, Master. This is your medicine. (baby crying) (digital beeping) - Listen. - Yes. - Go get the father and the daughter here. - Okay. This way, please. - Good morning. Are you better? - Yes, I am. Please, be seated. - Yes. - Thanks for taking me back here. This handkerchief, I believe it's yours, right? - Yes, it belongs to me. My dad said my mother gave it to me when I was a child. - Do you know that the lotus pattern, each petal has 909 stitches. Is that right? - I counted before. Each has 909 stitches. - And in the middle of the petals, you see a name. The name is Charlene. - Dad, it is Charlene. - If I'm right, it's been with you for 21 years. - You are. - You're her mother. - I am your mother, Charlene. - You're her mother? - Mmmm. My daughter. Your real name is Chang and your father, his name is Chung Chung Chi. - Chung Chung Chi. (light orchestral music) Dad? So, I know. You're my adopted father. - Yes, your father's name is Chang Chung Chi and he is the leader of the Lotus rebel. He was smart enough to use teaching as his cover. He taught and organized the rebels to fight. - What he said is right. I remember 21 years ago when the soldiers surrounded our house that day. I was pregnant with you. We fought hard, but we lost the battle. Someone must have betrayed us, but we don't know who the traitor was. But fortunately, some nuns helped me. I've been hiding in this temple since then. Shortly after that, your dad was executed by the soldiers and he died horribly. Then I gave birth to you, but the soldiers did not leave us alone. They tried to look for us and kill us. Then Lord Young said he wants to get rid of all the rebels and our family. (sighing) We had a friend whose daughter was as old as you who died. So, I asked her to take care of you and she gave you a new name and I left you with this handkerchief. Then I fled to the mountain and became a nun. And I have never forgotten about you. Until eight years ago, I came to this temple and use it as a base and then search for your whereabouts. They told me my girlfriend is dead. Someone else got my daughter. But they don't know who and where. (crying) I thought I would never see you again. (sniffling) Then I saw the handkerchief. (crying) - Mom. - And when I heard that the soldiers were coming, I traveled day and night to reach your friend. When I got there, she was near death. She asked me to take care of her and to make sure not to let her get caught, so I went ahead and changed your daughter's name again. That way the soldiers could not find her. That was about 20 years ago. - Thank you. (sniffling) (groaning) If not for your timely help, I don't know what would've happened to my daughter. (groaning) I'm so grateful. (moaning) - Oh, mom, dad. - Master, master. - You okay? - Master, master, master. (dramatic orchestral music) (digital beeping) (wind whooshing) (dramatic orchestral music) (digital beeping) (digital beeping) (digital beeping) (digital beeping) (wind whooshing) (digital beeping) - I've never seen this before. What is he doing? - It's called the lotus operation. - Lotus operation? - He uses his inner energy to force the bullet out of her body, to purify her. My mom will be okay very soon. - [Nun] Mmm. (coughing) - I like this word, longevity. (laughing) Take it away. - Yes. - Hello, master. All your friends, all the officials, all your relatives, they all got your invitations. Don't know if you know this, but you have other instructions? - Mmm, this time I want you to go all the way. I'll give you a bonus if you like. So, do it right. Everything is on me. - Oh, thank you. - I'm very generous. What about the girl then? - We have delivered her your gifts. Everything's okay. - Come on, old man. The guy really liked your daughter the first time he laid eyes on her. Look at these gifts that he was bestowed upon her. Look at the cars and the houses and the jewelry. How come you look like you're not happy still? If the money belonged to me, why I would buy so much. I'd buy all this real estate. I'd invest in the stock market. I'd buy all these bottles of Dom Perignon. Hey, what's wrong with you? You should be happy for her. Now that you've accepted the money, I assume that you're happy with the marriage, aren't you? Now I've gotta go now, huh? I'll see you soon. - Mr. Foreman, I don't need these so-called wedding gifts, this trash. Why don't you let your wife, your daughter, your sisters marry that old fart. - Come on, girl. Don't play that hard to get game then. I'm doing this for you and your old man's good. You think about it. You future husband is wealthy and powerful, just like the emperor. Do you think you can fight him? - Dad, this is very wrong. Dad, can you just tell me why? Please. Dad, why are you so quiet? (crying) Oh, dad, what am I supposed to do? - The lotus operation really worked for me. - A year ago I used that technique. It was very useful. I'm good at CPR also. (breathing deeply) - [Both] Sorry to bother you. - There's a fisherman outside. He wants to see you. - A fisherman? Show him in. - [Both] Yes. - Come in, please. - Sure. Greetings to every one of you. - Come and meet my long-lost mother. We just met. - Nice to meet you, ma'am. - Have a seat, please. - What is it? Tell us what's happening. - Oh, yes, I will. Everyone of us are very happy, 'cause you're safe. Right now, everyone's gathering weapons for the big attack. It looks like everyone's ready for the big fight. We're just waiting for you to lead us. - All our officials are here. - So are theirs. I heard they're all going to a wedding. As far as I know, they seem to know all of our movements. There could be a spy among us. - So, you're worrying about spies? - Yes, we are now at high alert. - High alert? - And we have our suspicions. - Mmm, it's such a shame. Well, I think I know who the spy is. At the Roadside Inn, I saw him talking to the bartender and then they were whispering. Then I saw the bartender put some powder in your wine. I thought he tried to poison you guys. - So, you're the one who shattered our cup. - Under the circumstances, that's the only way to save you. - Ch, ch, you see? If we have a spy among us, all our security's being compromised. - Dad, we must flush that spy out. We are too close to our attack to mess this up. (knocking on door) - Who's there? - [Man] Are you out or are you in? - I'm in. - [Man] Name a game show. - Jeopardy!, baby. - [Man] Are you old? - I'm not young. - [Man] I like older men. Thanks very much for letting me in. It's nice to see you again. - Ah. Good evening, dear friend. Come in. I can't believe it. You're finally free now, my brother. - It's nice to see you too. It's the rebel girl and her father who set me free. - Ah. Is rebel girl and her father in town now? - Yes, they are. They sent me here to ask you to go to an emergency meeting. - How long will we be gone? - Only for a few minutes. - Ah, a few minutes. - [Man] If you don't mind, we should go now. - Of course. Uh, I'm working late for my many clients. Let me come around. It won't be long. Please, have a seat. - I think I'll wait out there. - Sure. - [Man] They're waiting for us. I think we really should hurry up. What's wrong? - Oh, my sneakers need to be tied. I gotta tie tie my shoes right now. Okay, there we go. (paper crumbling) (mysterious orchestral music) - [Spy] They are at Lotus Temple, mmm. (percussive orchestral music) - Greetings, greetings. Hello, everybody. Ah. - Hmmm. The time is now. Know what to do. - It's all for one and one for all. - [All] It's all for one and one for all. - Now you may be seated. So sit your butts down now. - Fellow, rebels, I've made a decision, so listen carefully. I believe the best time to attack the officials is August 15th. Do we all agree? - Oh, that's great. Get rid of them. The people will all rejoice. Lotus uprising is the only hope people have. - But I am concerned. If we act hastily, we can suffer massive loss. - We won't suffer any loss. (fast forwarding) - That wasn't why. You let your guard down, you traitor. - Oh, my leader. What do you mean by that? - Let me see, hmm. I am the daughter of your enemy, getting back at you. - What? What the heck are you talking about? (ominous orchestral music) - Hi, old pal. You still recognize me? I'm your old friend. - Who are you? (laughing) - I'm her mother. Look again, carefully, you dirty dog. - You, you again? - You dirty dog. You remember 20 years ago? (stammering) - You bastard. Look at this. - Leader, now I see. Let the past be gone by. - Before the lotus altar, you only have one place to go. - I was wrong. I wanted to get rich. The Young family wanted all of you to be dead and they said that if I helped them that I would get some of their position in royal court, so I was their spy and helped them out. I was the one who helped them set the trap last time. I was the one who told them where you were. I was at the Roadside Inn to try to prison you. But I don't have a choice. - You filth, you do have a choice and you chose the money and you know it's wrong. - You traitor, left me with so many scars. (crying) You killed so many. Now it's your turn to die. - Oh, please forgive me. I beg your forgiveness, please please please. - [Man] There's nothing worse than a traitor. (all yelling) - Please, have mercy on me, please please. - Hmm, according to our laws and regulations, your sins are unforgivable. Heh, you go and hang yourself. - [Man] Check it out, dude. (all murmuring) Oh, man. That's right, I can't believe it. - What's going on here? - I came out here to open the door this morning and he was hanging there. - Dead. According to the body, I think nobody murdered him here. - My lord, I think somebody make him kill himself. They must have found out he's our spy. - Wait, give him a good burial. I'm going to lunch. - You and you, bury him. - Ya ya. Ya. Yes, my lord. Here's a message for you. It is very urgent. - Mmm. - So, what do you know? - According to his last report, the Lotus rebel will be attacking soon. We're to defend our town. If we cannot keep the peace, our superior will eat us for dinner at the Kentucky Fried Chicken. - I figured that much. We must draw first blood or they will kick our butts. We should start arresting them, so they will know we are in charge. And we'll arrest everyone, anyone who looks like a rebel. - That's a good idea. - So, arrest them and lock them all up. Rebel or no rebel, we kill all of them. (all yelling) - He's not a rebel. He's not a rebel. Where are you taking my husband? - Huh? I'm not a rebel. (all yelling) I'm no rebel. - Where are you taking my husband? (crying) - Don't arrest him. He's not a rebel. Don't take, don't take him. Bring him, don't take him. Bring him back, bring him back. (all yelling) - That SOB, he arrests so many innocent people. He's crazy. - If he wants to start something, he's asking for it, you know? Let's fight for it. It's totally him, not me. - Yeah! - We can't fight on impulse. I think we should all wait for our leader's instructions. Now, listen to me. Just be patient. Otherwise, we'll all look like fools, you know? - They're closing in on us. When will they be back? - Yeah, when will our leaders be back? - In a couple of days. - Dad, over there. (arrow flying) - Why should you hang yourself? - Hey, tough guy, why would you commit suicide? (crying) - Would you please just let me die? They're taking away my daughter. - No, my friend. We are all here to let you know we'll do anything for you. - Well then, just save my daughter. Are you the wanted one? - Your daughter is fortunate to have you as a father. - [Dad] Thank you. You're so kind. (crying) (laughing) - Does this look good, eh? - [Woman] Oh, yeah. - Well, it's too dark. Let's try another one. - [Mr. Young] Whatever you say, sweetie. (laughing) - Put this on. Great. Hmm, this pattern is really nice. The color is happy and bright. It really fits your style. (laughing) Hmmm, I really like this one. - Okay. This is the one then. Thank you very much. My son, what took you so long, huh? - Yes, dad, you want to see me? - Have you arrested the rebel leader yet? - Not yet. - What about the prisoners? - I got many of them, some in prisons, some in temples, many of them are getting so weak, many of them are dying. - Way to go, kiddo. And now I wanna make some money. If they wanna go, they can pay me. - Everybody, it's not long till out planned uprising. From what we have already observed, they have started arresting people for two purposes. You see the first is to try to defeat our moral and our plan and the second is to blackmail the people. - That is ridiculous. Rebel girl, do you have any plans? - When is the landlord's birthday? - Well, in two days. - In just two days? It's not what we planned for. Well, we can adjust. - Just tell us what you think. - Let us plan right now. We will go ahead and prepare a surprise attack. - Hey, open up open up, open up the door. (laughing) Oh, what's the matter? Hey, man, things'll be okay, you see? Say yes and things will turn around. (laughing) Hey, you, oh, excuse me. Excuse me, starting tomorrow, you will have very rich family ties. (laughing) And for makeup, you can hire Max Factor himself to put it on for you. Just look pretty. - Makeup? What do you know? - Uh, well, just look pretty tomorrow, to make your father proud. And look really beautiful. (laughing) (firecrackers popping) (grand orchestral music) (grand orchestral music) - My brothers, sisters, today we are gathered to pay tribute to the flag, the lotus flower. Let's kneel. Before we go, let's pray. - [All] May victory be ours, wherever we go. - And we will fight with the force from within. - [All] Now let us fight with the force from within. Now let us fight with the force from within. Now let us fight with the force from within. Now let us fight with the force from within. (all murmuring) (percussive music) - Oh, thank you, thank you.

(all cheering) Ah, look at the bride and groom there. Aren't they lovely? (all murmuring) - [Man] What's going on? Oh my god. - [Woman] Oh, what's going on? (screaming) - I am the rebel girl. Don't anyone be a fool. If anyone comes closer, I will kill him. - Hmm. (laughing) Well, I knew you'd be here today. (laughing) Rebel girl, you are such a fool. You are here, you never get out of here alive. - No, I won't? I don't plan to leave here without you. Well, I am not here for nothing. So, come with me unarmed. - Don't be foolish. Let us talk here. - No deal. You will have to go. - But where? - The lovely Roadside Inn. - The lovely Roadside Inn? - Go. Go. - My lord. - Stand back, stand back. (grunting) Stupid, you stupid fool. Get out of the way. Trying to protect me. If you were good, I wouldn't be like this. Jerks. - [Man] Oh my goodness. - [Woman] Oh, what's going on? (all murmuring) - [Man] Oh my goodness. - [Woman] What's going on? - Hyah, hyah, hyah. Hyah. Hyah, hyah. (all yelling) (swords clanging) (yelling and grunting) (heavy kicking and punching) (yelling) (swords clanging) (yelling and grunting) (heavy kicking and punching) - Hey, leader, we've killed the soldiers in this place already. - That is great. Now listen to me. You take a group of men, go over there, and follow them. - Aye aye, sir. (all yelling) - Ah, ah. - Go back in. - Yes, so sorry. Sorry. - Go back in. - Do you want to save your life or do you want money? (laughing) - You got me here now, rebel girl. How much do you want? - How much do we want? I have decided we want this much. - 25? - White silver, 25,000 ounces. - 25,000 ounces? - Ah, there's just no way, no way. - Well, actually the price was set up by you two guys. - Set up by us? - Remember you asked from you captives 50 ounces of silver each. You arrested quite a few hundred people. Adding them up is the total ounces. - But-- - My friend, you can pay the money or release the prisoners. - But it's a lot of money though. - Mmm. That is a lot of money, I know. I'll let 'em all go. - So, write to your goons, one letter to your son, one letter to your escort. (crying) - Save your daddy. - Shut up, shut up. (heavy breathing) - Head escort, letter from the boss. It's urgent. - Impossible. Are you sure that's the message from the boss? - Right, you don't release them, they won't release our boss. They said no release means death to him. - Oh, hurry. Go save your dad. - Oh, so he can come home soon, please. - If I release them, I will lose face. It's my reputation, okay okay okay? Now, come on. Tell me how many people there were. - Well, I don't know. Maybe 12, 20? - You wanna start something with me? Listen. - [Man] Yes. - I'll make them sorry for what they have done to us. - [Man] Yes, sir. - Leaders, the sir refused to release the prisoners. He's getting so just to attack us. - I'm expecting this. Dad, you stay here. I'll get the rebels together. - Fine, I'll take care of here. Mmm. - Go. (mumbling) - [Vincent] You two come over. - Yeah. - Watch them closely. I'll go check around. - [Both] Yes, sir. - Mmm. Hmm. - Hurry, hurry. - Ah, hmm. Come on, handsome. You're thirsty. Our house wine is really yum, try it. - But I just came to find the enemy. - You too, my friend. It's on me. - Thank you, thank you, okay. Okay, great. - Please enjoy. The food's still hot. (laughing) - Let's go in. - Let's drink, man. Yeah. - Listen up. Hey, listen up, you guys. We've got the landlord already. - Yeah, we got that no-good two-terming scumbag. - Thanks to you all then. Now I need you to take everyone to the temple right away, for them to let you all in. Stay there and get ready for the soldiers. - Yes, sir. - Ah, oh, don't stay here. Let's go. - Yeah, we're gonna save you. You go that way, I go that way. - Okay, come on. - Let's go.
