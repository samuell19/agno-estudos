I just, I dropped them off a while ago. He said he's going to run some errands and then I'm going to pick them up now. Yeah, I hope he's not up to one of his capers also. Anyway, you want me to tell him anything? I'll take care of him, don't worry about it. All right, Miss Chism, I'll tell him you love him. You take care. - Okay everybody Mr. Bunch is on his way, we're gonna get started. (suspenseful music) So why don't you take your robes off and keep the energy going? Great, you're here. Why don't you go on and take your place? (suspenseful music) (camera clicks) (suspenseful music) (camera clicks) (suspenseful music) (camera clicks) (suspenseful music) (camera clicks) (suspenseful music) Kay, got everything ready for you, it's all yours. - Good and a very good morning to you ladies. Hello, nice to see you again, Wendy. Well, a little overdressed aren't we? (Dick chuckles) Absolutely outstanding my dear. Oh, me Tarzan, you Jane eh? (Dick laughs) Okay, is it warm enough for you? Well, you're certainly warming me up. (Dick chuckles) Suzan, follow me. (dramatic music) (camera clicks) (dramatic music) - The jap, move her a little to the left - Her name is Tana Wu, Dick. She's Chinese. - Oh, I'm sorry, my mistake. Would you kindly ask the chink to move to her left? - Joey, have Tana move to the left, please? - Can we stop screwing around? Are we ready to do this or not? Chuck? - It's Frank - Whatever. - Whenever you say Mr. Bunch. - Oh, I say, I say, I say, damn, thing's costing me a fortune already. - Ready to roll, okay, everybody, this is a take. Joey, Phil, fog up the rooms. Ready with playback. Roll tape. Action on the set. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] In his wildest fantasy, he's certain you're the star. (dramatic music) Relentless, a new sensation for the body. Hypnotic, alluring. Downright uncontrollable. (set banging) (dramatic music) - What the hell's going on? (women screaming) What the hell's going on here? (suitcase thuds) Hey you! Who the hell's that asshole? You two, here. Go get that guy. Go on. - Dick, this one looks like she needs to go to the hospital. - Oh God. As if I need that right now? Look, make her a cup of tea and call her a cab and call my attorney, just in case. (Dick coughs) (dramatic music) - He's gotta be down there somewhere! (dramatic music) Where the hell did he go? Call Dick. - Come on Darrell, God dammit. (phone beeping) (metal creaking) (suspenseful music) - Hey, hey, hey, hey, wait! - Jesus Christ Darrel, what's going on? - Drive, drive, drive! (suspenseful music) - Careful, you don't know what's in it. - Easy, I do know, there's nothing in here. There's nothing in here except an old newspaper, a crossword puzzle, and a stupid pen. Look, I wouldn't worry about it. It was probably just some dirty pervert looking to sell some dirty pictures. - Yeah, yeah. - And what more you have? - Fine, fine, okay. We'll just get everything set up again cause I want to go home sometime this week. - You're so focused. - Oh, did you get him? - No, but don't worry about it. He didn't see anything. - Shit. - Forget that, plane landed an hour ago Dick. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Oh, well good. - They're very pleased. They want another shipment as soon as possible. - Good, that's fine. Well, there's plenty to go around here right? - Yeah. Did you get a chance to look at that video? - What? - Those two girls for the hairspray spot? - Yeah, yeah. They was, they was both okay. - Which one you want to go with? - Well, Manny, my man, that depends, which one of them wants to, you know, with me? - Gotcha. - Yeah, God, I love this business. (dramatic music) (engine rumbles) (car door bangs) - Eric, Just hear me out for just one second. - No, Darrel, no! I don't, I heard it the whole way home. I don't want to hear about it. - Eric, you will not believe what I'm working on right now. Okay, I am in the big league. I'm on, I'm on top of the game. - The last time he went on top of the game it cost me 1500 bucks to bail your out of jail. - Money well spent if you asked me. - Yeah, well I didn't think so. I can't afford to do it again, especially right now. - Anyway, Eric, don't worry about that, all right? I mean, you're one of the best ad men in the business. You were working at the top agency in town. - Yeah, until they gave a promotion to the boss's nephew. Oh, their loss. I would have quit too. - Five years, five years Darrel. I'm telling you, man, the only way to get ahead is to go into business for yourself. - It's always been my policy. So what's your plan? - I want to start my own ad agency. I figured it'll take, it'll take about a hundred grand. I'm just a little short. - How short? - About a hundred grand. - Sounds to me like you're in the market for a job, huh? That's perfect. But that's why I'm here. I am on a really heavy case right now and I need you're help. - No, no way, no way man. - Come on, at least hear me out. - No, no, Darrel, look man. You're the one that should be out looking for a job. You got to get out of this, this window peeping business. - I like being a PI. - Well, let me tell you something man. That can be very dangerous and you're not, you're not exactly James Bond. You're, I mean, you kind of a klutz. Okay, I'm sorry, I don't mean to hurt your feelings but. (dramatic music) Who's that? - Caitland Montague, age 20, she's missing. I was hired to find her by her father, Monte Montague. - Monte Montague, the billionaire? - [Darrel] That's right. - He hired you to find her? - That's right. Right place and the right time. I had a friend on the inside and I ain't going to blow this one. - What happened to her? - They don't have a clue. She just disappeared. But in the last few days I traced her steps to a place called Visions Advertising. And that's where all of a sudden they end. - Visions? I've heard of them, they're sleazy. - Yeah. Visions is owned by a guy named Dick Bunch. This scumbag has a criminal record a mile long, usually involving smuggling. See, I think he's back in the business and he's using this whole agency as a coverup. - What does that have to do with the missing girl? - Here's how it ties in. See, I got lucky. I found one of her old boyfriends and he told me that she left him for a guy at visions who promised her he was going to go to this great gig. He was going to make her a supermodel, but want to talk to the people at visions, guess what? No one remembered her. They said that they see a lot of girls. - And what does this have to do with me? - I'm going to need your help to find out what's really going on. - How? - Look, I need some insight info on these guys and they just happened to need a guy in their creative department. You obviously need a job, it's a perfect match. - No, no, no, no way. - [Darrel] Eric. - No, no man. N-O, I'm not. - Eric, you have the credibility man, they will hire you in a second. It's for me, for me, please. - No Darryl, N-O. - All right look, I will pay you a hundred bucks okay? Just go apply for the job, bug the office. - What? Bug the office? What if I get caught? - God, Erin, you're such a pussy. You have a black belt. - I'll tell him that. I'll tell them that when they put the gun to my head. - Eric, this girl is in real trouble, okay? I mean, we could really be saving her life. I'll pay you 150 bucks. Every minute counts. - All right, all right. Just go make the appointment, all right? - I already did, thanks. (Eric sighs) (dramatic music) - [Caitland] Hi darling. I've been thinking about our talk. Maybe you're right. This modeling thing, I mean it just isn't working out. I'd like to talk about it on Thursday, when we meet for lunch. Daddy, I miss you. Bye. (dramatic music) - I waited for her. Caitland never showed up. She would've called me by now. I was going to make it all up to her. (dramatic music) It's all my fault. - I don't understand how sir. - [Caitland] Stop telling me what to do. This is not your decision, this is my decision. - Caitland be reasonable. - It's the first time daddy it's not about you and your money. It's about me. The photographers love me. - They love the fact that you're a Montague. - I don't need your name to prove myself. - Caitland, Caitland, honey, honey, now look, this, this modeling thing. What does it amount to? It's, it's loathsome, it's troublesome. It's mired with disappointment. Look, I made you better than that. You can't do this, you won't do it. - Oh yes I will, and there is nothing you can do to stop me. - All you're going to do is embarrass yourself. You're going to take our good name and make it-- - What? - A punchline for Wall Street pundits. - Pundits? You can't even talk to me like a real father okay? Pundits! - I won't let you make it out there. Pride, pride and control. Tools to build an empire, but weapons to destroy a dynasty. I pushed her and I pushed her and she finally found the door. I'm afraid the worst has happened and it's all my fault. - How's that? - She always knew how to get to me, right down to my soul. (Monty sighs) She defied me all through her teenage years, she taunted me with her parties, her drinking. Her boyfriends. I tried to lead her towards a better path, but as always she had her own ideas. - We'll do everything we can. (dramatic chord) (dramatic music) - It was so lucky to get this place right below Vision's office. The last tenant actually had a heart attack. He died right on his desk. Is that luck or what? Here we are. Oh, check this out, let me show you something. See this watch? A piano wire. This thing could do some serious damage, here. - A nuclear detonator? - Better, this pen right here is carrying about a hundred CCS of metformin hydrochloride. You just hold it to your mouth and blow, the guy'll be out 10 seconds flat, here. Hey, don't suck, blow. Where's my bug, where's my bug? - Darrel, where do you get this stuff? - PI's holy bible. Where do you think the movies get their ideas? - I should have known. - Oh shit. - What is it? - I don't know man. - The same guy was hanging outside of Avalon studios yesterday. - It's just probably a coincidence, you're getting paranoid. I could be wrong. - All right, check this out. Here is the bug all right? It's on now. When you're ready to plant it just peel the adhesive cover, and you're ready to roll all right? Let's synchronize our watches. You got to go, time for the appointment, let's go, let's go, let's go. Now listen. I'll be with you every step of the way all right? If it gets hairy, I'll be there so fast they won't know what hit them. - You're a dangerous, dangerous man Darrel. - Believe that. Hey, make me proud man. (gun clatters) (dramatic music) - Dick, listen if you're so nervous about that pervert why don't you let me call the police? - No way, do you hear me, no way okay? - All right, all right. - I've got enough problems, all right, all rght? - All right. - Hello girls. Okay, good to see you, glad you could make it. Just going to spend a penny, you know. (suspenseful music) - Oh my God! (Susan screams) (gun firing) - Oh shit, oh shit. (gun firing) (dramatic music) - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah I'm fine. What about you? - Who are you? - I'm Eric Down. - Dick Bunch the visionary of Visions. Eric, I'm certainly glad you came across when you did. - Dick, what the hell is going on? - What does it look like stupid? Some guy just tried to kill me. Well get security. - God, you were really incredible. - Suzan, Suzan, that is enough. - Actually I'm your one o'clock appointment. - Yeah, yeah. Well Eric if you're, if you're advertising's anything like you're street fighting you're hired. Follow me. Suzan get a grip. Oh please girls, go on, get back inside. Come on everybody, back to work, what you doing? It was only a car backfiring, all right, you okay? Suzan, put the kettle on and get me vallum, take half a dozen yourself. So Eric eh? You've met Sam. - No not officially, hi Eric, I'm Sam. Thank you so much for being there. - You're welcome. My pleasure. - I just talked to security, they said he got away but I'll have them go ahead and call the police. Okay? It's the right things to do. - Well guys, my break times over, I better get to my meeting. - You sure you're up to it? Here, feel my heart all right? - I'm fine Dick. Thanks again, oh, and good luck with the job. - Thank you. - Sight men like that I don't need. America is so violent. Come to my office. Yeah, take a seat. Well, let's see your portfolio. I mean look, me hands are still shaking. So what we got? Swiss mouthwash, Carnegie Insurance and a Fox Cosmetics. Yeah well, very nice but they're all boring eh? Now let me tell you something about visions. We believe in getting down to the bottom line, excite your public, make them want what you've got. And if the ads a little controversial, so much the better. So Eric let us now take a minute to see how you think. Take this (speaking in foreign language). Wong Lee's world of clown, off the top of your head what ideas can you come up for this? - Ooh, try another one, just try another one. - All right then. Well how about Thermics Medicated Shampoo? - The action starts when you get wet. - Yeah, I like it, yeah. Yeah, very nice. So what you got there then? Hey? - What? - No blue jeans? That's un American. You see Eric we also represent the Growls Jeans account. And I'll tell you what, I want you to come up with a presentation for a whole new campaign for them. What you say? - Excuse me guys, I'm sorry to interrupt. I got a run and rip up these prints. - That's fine, come here, come here. Eric here is gonna work on the Jeans account. - Hey, fantastic. - Yeah. You see Sam is our Growl Jeans girl. Aren't you? - Well great, we're gonna be working together. - Mr. Bunch. - Yeah? - Can I see you for a second. - No, give us ten minutes. - I'm afraid it can't wait. - Give me a second. Sam why don't you and Eric make a plan to discuss our ideas for the product, all right? - Okay, sure. - Oh hang on, did you say you'd take the position? - Yeah, yeah. - Terrific. Listen, I'm up against the wall on this one, everyone shooting at me today. I'll need something by 10 o'clock tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Okay. - Good, okay. So collaborate. - Eric unfortunately I'm booked solid today, doesn't give us much time to get together. - Why don't we get together tonight? My place. - You're place? Sure, okay, how about eight o'clock? - Great. Here, I'll give you the address. - All right. - I don't have a pen. - Now what's the matter? - Our Middle Eastern friends are in town. - Amir from London? - Yeah. - Well what's she doing here? - I don't know, they just said that they wanna get together tomorrow at 11:30. - This is bullshit. Well next time we're gonna need some kind of notice. We'll tell security to put and extra guard on. Oh Manny, Manny have this guy Eric checked out. Make sure he's for real. (dramatic music) - Oh man, that was great! I heard everything, everything, it was like I was there. - That's great, yeah you son of a bitch, where the hell were you? - And you, you took the job, I can't believe it. - Yeah I took the job for my own reasons. - So I heard. - Oh I forgot, yeah, yeah, you heard everything. It was like you were there! - So what'd she look like? Come on, come on, what she look like? - She was nice. She was very nice. - Baby, see, see, I watch your back, you watch hers. Everybody's happy. - Shut up. You know you failed to mention that somebody's trying to kill Dick. - I didn't know but this is exactly the kind of information I need. You know you should consider working for me full time. - What are you crazy? - Why is that so crazy? There's good money in this business. After you. Look at the progress you made in one day, one day, boom we're already in and we're sitting pretty. - Yeah, boom, I almost get shot Darrel. - [Bunch] And in the light of our camel jockey friends being in town, are they going to want the next shipment? - [Manny] I don't know. - I'm not going to take no chances. I'm calling Abib to find out what the hell is going on. Yeah, hello? What's that? Oh yeah, yeah, hi how are ya? Listen, I just want to ask you, you know that now that Amir's over here, do you still want the next delivery? You do? Good, good, good, oh really, oh please, no, I'm sure you'll be delighted with the merchandise. Yeah, yeah. Listen now, Kathy Juno will contact you, yeah. Yeah she's leaving today on-- - [Manny] Stella air, flight 336. - [Bunch] Stella air, flight 336, which arrived in London at-- - [Manny] Eight o'clock. - [Bunch] Eight o'clock - Yes, yes, we got him man, we got him! - Take care, you take care to, bye. So there we are, business as usual. Well that's good so what time does the plane leave? - [Manny] 4:55 from McCarran. - [Bunch] Everything's been taken care of? - [Manny] I can assure you, everything's been handled. - I can't believe this. We nailed him man, like that, so fast. Hey, you got to admit, we make an awesome team. - Yeah, well how exactly have we nailed him? - Yeah, Sergeant Harris please. Thanks. What, does a house have to fall on you? Didn't you listen? She's delivering a shipment of drugs man. They're using these girls as couriers. - Why would, why would Kathy be running drugs? - That's the rub, she wouldn't. You see, we bust Dick, we find Caitland. Yeah Jack. Yeah, Darrell, listen got a little piece of information for you. Yeah, how'd you'd like to bust Dick Bunch? No, no you know, the guy told you about last week. Yeah right, well, listen, there's a drug deal going down today at McCarran airport 4:30 Stella airlines. No shit. Yeah, it'll probably get you those Lieutenant bars you wanted. Okay, I'll see you at 4:30. (phone bangs) Let's roll dude, let's go, let's go, let's go. (engine rumbles) Shit, where's Jack? - Hey, that guy with the blonde that's, that's Dick's buddy. - That must be Kathy. - All right, when you land in London, there's going to be a guy to meet you there. His name's Abe Safier. He'll get you to your contact over there, he'll also take care of all your arrangements, hotel, personal phone calls. - Great. - Whatever. - Okay. - Okay. - Terrific. - All right then. I guess I'll see you in a couple of weeks. - Okay, great. - Good luck. - Thanks Manny. - Break a leg. - Bye bye. - Oh shit, he's leaving, come on, let's get him. - No, no, Darrel, Darrel, come on. Look, let's wait for the police to get here. We know where to find him. It's it's her worried about. - Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack. Jack, Jack over here. - What do you got Darrel? - She's right over there. We got to grab her before she boards the plane. - She, who's she? I thought we were here to bust Dick Bunch. - We are, she's his courier. Come on. - Go over there check to see if there's any luggage, come on. - Just a minute sister. - Ow, let go of me! - Darrel, we'll handle it from here please. We have reason to believe you have narcotics on your possession, we'd like to check your bag, now Micheal. - What? Hey, I'm going to miss my plane. - Where's that flight to Miss Chanel? - To London for a job. I'm a model and if I don't make that plane, I'm going to be out of that job. - There's nothing here Sarge. - [Man] Jack! - Yeah Bobby, what do you got? - The woman said the only things she's carrying is her bag. - See? - [Jack] Jesus. - Now can I have my bag and go now? - Just a minute, Jack, please, please. I know that she's caring, okay? Only an idiot would carry in her travel bag. - And if you're wrong, Darrel? - Jack I'm not okay. I will, I will stake my reputation on this. Okay, we have to strip search her. - What? - Jesus Christ. You're nuts, I only have your word on this. - Look, I'm going to miss my plane. - Jack, please I have a very reliable source on this one. - Like who? - I can't divulge right now. - All right, that's it you wanna search me? Okay fine there? Is that what you wanted to see? Can I go now? - Give her the bag back. I'm sorry for the delay Miss Chanel. - Not half as sorry as you're gonna be when I call your captain. - Jack, you let her go. - Darrel, you see that ass? You thinks he's got a pound of cocaine stuck up there? I don't give a shit. It's the stuff coming in I'm worried about. Let's go guys. Darrel do me a favor, stop playing cop and stop calling me. - Man. I don't get it. What screwed up? - Someday you'll have to let me know. This is where I get off Darrel. (dramatic music) (Darrel sighs) - [Woman] Tell them, tell him Caitland. Listen very carefully Mr. Montague. - They don't wanna hurt me. They want money daddy. - [Woman] How much? (Caitland crying) - 20 million dollars. - [Woman] No police, no negotiations, no fucking around. You got that daddy? - Daddy. - Monty, I know what you're going through. Caitland was like a sister to me, but these guys are going to screw up and when they do that's when we're going to make our play. - I'll tell you exactly how are we going to play it plain and simple. I'll pay. - Don't you even want to discuss this first sir? - We have no time to discuss this. - How the hell do you plan on getting $20 million together in two hours? - I can do that and by playing it simple, I mean just that, we do it exactly the way they said it. - Monty come on, be reasonable. - No police, no negotiations, no fucking around. I'll make the delivery. (doorbell rings) - Hey. - Hey. How you doing? - Good, thanks. - Great, have a seat. - Okay. - [Eric] Can I get you some wine? - Yeah sure. Anything's fine. Thank you. - Yeah. Well, I hope you didn't come here for nothing. - What do you mean? - I'm probably gonna quit. - Quit? You're joking. Why? - See I never intended on taking the job in the first place but after I found that I was working with you well, I changed my mind and now I don't know what to do. - Wow. I've heard some pretty wild lines before Eric but. So do you always interview for jobs you have no intention of accepting? - No, it's a long, long, ugly story. - Well, you'll have to tell me about it sometime. - Does that mean I can see you again? - You did save my life. - What, what the hell was that about today? - I have no idea. That, nothing like that has ever happened there before. - I don't think Visions is a good place for you to be working. - That may be, but finding another job is not that easy. Besides the Growl Girl is a huge deal for me, I need it. - I don't need the work that badly. - Eric. Bottom line, we are in such a tight deadline over there. If we don't turn in a pitch tomorrow, there's a good chance Visions will lose this account and that means I'm out of a job. - Well, that might not be such a bad thing. - I know this sounds awfully selfish but is there any way you'd consider staying on? Just to see this campaign through? It might be fun. What do you think, a couple days, a week? How bad can it be? (suspenseful music) - Don't move. (woman screaming) Shut up! Where is Montague? Where is Montague. - He's out of town. - Do not lie to me. Where is he? - He's at the summer house. - Liar! - I called him myself, he told me he'd bring the money. - He has call forwarding. - What? - All his calls are forwarded to the summer house. - Call forwarding? Wait. No, don't bother, she's only the maid, she's no challenge. - Let's go. - Yeah, great, that's terrific. So before we move on I'd just like you to fill out this little questionnaire. You know, give us your number. Bet I know what yours are. 30, 20, 30 eh, am I right? Just a little something we like to do to get to know you better. - Dick. - [Bunch] What? - Frank from Avalon Studios is on line three. - Hello Frank, how are you? - I'm fine Mr. Bunch, are you all right? - Oh I'm fine. - I heard about the shooting yesterday. I just thought you oughta know, a guy came around here the other day, he said we was a detective. He wanted to know about a girl I used to date. This was probably stupid, but I later realized I may have sent him in your direction. - What do you mean? - He was looking for your girl Caitland Ross. I told him the last time I actually saw her was when I walked in on her. She was all over one of the guys from Visions. We argued, I left, she was using me. - What guy from Visions? - What's the difference, it's all water under the bridge. Look, I just wanted you to know in case the guy who was shooting at you turns out to bet he same guy. - This guy. - [Frank] What guy? - The detective. What'd he look like? - Oh, short dude, about 5'5 ,a sort of dopey expression. Kinda muscular, sound familiar? - No, but thank you for calling, I appreciate it. - Hey my pleasure, take care of yourself. - Bye. So finished? Right, well love I got your number so I'll give you a call when we've decided right? Okay, find your own way out? Good. - Yes Dick? - Send Manny in here right now. - Okay. - Hello, and who might you be? - Hi, I'm Eric Down. I'm here for the Growl Jeans presentation. - Ah, the new kid on the block. Welcome, I'm Tom Rehnquist. - Nice to meet you Tom. - Morning guys. - Hello Sam. - Tom. - You ready for this? - As ready as I'll ever be. - [Manny] Everybody's in the conference room waiting. - [Bunch] Take a seat. Caitland Ross. Was you banging her? - Dick I don't know what Frank told you. - Just give me an answer, yes or no. - Yeah I did. But let me explain to you what happened. - What the hell do you think you were doing? You're going to jeopardize our whole operation. You worth this piece of shit. - It was before I knew that we were going to use her Dick and it just happened. How was I supposed to know that she was seeing Frank? She never even mentioned his name. - Why didn't you tell me before? - I don't know. Maybe because I knew you'd be pissed off and she stopped seeing Frank and you kept pushing to make the deal with her. So I figured best thing to do would be, forget it. Do the deal. - Man you really blew it. - Why, what's going on? - Well you telling. Some gumshoe's sniffing around the Avalon studios, the lone ranger used me for target practice in the hallway and now you with more balls than brains. God damn it Manny! Next time you have an urge to use the casting couch, don't mess around with those girls. Got it? Yeah, I got it. - [Bunch] Let's go an see what those guys have come up with. - Very interesting huh little dude. - Sorry for the delay folks. - Hello everybody. All right Well I guess it's show time. - All right that's enough. Let's get down to it shall we? Tom, what you got? - New 32nd spot for a diamond fair. - Good. (dramatic music) - Look. - Oh, that's so pretty. (women gasps) - That is so big. - Oh my gosh. - You know if I had one that big, I'd be showing it off to. - Look at the size of that. - I've never seen one that big before. - Whoa, that's yummy. I know. You think he'd let us try it on? - Let's ask him. Can I touch it. - Oh yeah. - [Man] In a women's world where the only thing that really counts as size, remember The Jewelers. - Oh yes, yes, yes. Very nice. Very good, I like it. Good, well done. Eric, you're on. - Okay you have this beautiful beautiful girl. She's in a blouse, in Growl Jeans. She's ascending the stairs, smoke everywhere. At the top of the stairs her man awaits and he's got want in his eyes. As well as other places. As she gets closer to him she drops the blouse and just as they're about to meet a female announcer says you'll be looking so good in your Growl jeans, he'll just wanna get you out of them. Man puts his hands on her hips, she looks over her shoulder, we get a close up of her face, we hear pants unzipping, and the girl. (Sam growls) - We close on the logo and fade to black. - Eric I'm sorry but I have to tell you, but that is absolutely terrific. (Bunch chuckles) Yeah, Sam, great. (group laughs) Yeah, yeah, yeah. I want you to make a video of that right now in the studio. You make the arrangements and when you put it together don't forget to keep in the bottom line. - What's the bottom line? - The bottom line, yeah. You don't know what I'm talking about, do you? Oh dear, oh dear, I need a holiday. Tom, tell our boy what the bottom line is. - Sex sells. - Sex sells Eric, sex sells. And in one way or another, everyone's buying it. Thank God. - By the way Dick. I've got this killer idea for the Thurman shocks and stress campaign. I'd like to use Kathy for it. - Well, Kathy is no longer with the firm. - What, she was just here yesterday. - Yeah well yesterday she quit. She's going off to Mary to get marryland. - Well, maybe if we offer some more money? - She is no longer with us. - Just find somebody else. - End of story. Yeah, so, well that wraps that up. (suspenseful music) - [Eric] Darrel! - Jesus Christ, what are you doing here? - Can you bring up the phone numbers from Dick's phone call to Abib? - Yeah, definitely. I just overheard a conversation between Dick and Manny. Manny was the guy who was banging Caitland when the engineer walked in on him, we're on the right track. - Listen, get the international operator and find out what that country code is. Look in Dick's meeting Dick said that Kathy got on a plane to go to Maryland. We both saw her get on a plane and go to London. - Yeah, can you give me the country code for 964 please? - You want to know why there wasn't any merchandise on Kathy at the airport? Because Kathy was the merchandise. - Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean Kathy was the merchandise? Yeah, no shit. I mean thanks. - It was, it was the way Dick said sex sells and everyone's buying. Scumbag. I started thinking he's got the perfect setup. He interviews all these beautiful girls for his ads but they're also potential goods for his other business. Do they live alone, will they be missed? - You'll never guess what I call just went to. Iraq. Oh my God and Caitland, Caitland Montagu. - Sold off his merchandise. - White slavery. - Manny with one thing after another, this week is really getting off to a crappy start. - You know what? I forgot my cigarettes. Wanna pull the car around? I'll be right back. - See what I mean? Crappy. Here mate, get us our car, would you? Thank you. (car booms) Stone the bleeding crows. (dramatic music) - [Manny] You all right? - Is anyone hurt? - Yeah, the valet. (gun fires) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (cop cries out) - Call an ambulance! Help! It'll be all right okay? Don't move, don't move, all right? (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (engine rumbles) - Towns got it's weirdos huh? (sirens wailing) (com buzzes) - [Suzy] Dick, Frank from Avalon Studios just called. He-- - Don't want to talk to anyone right now, can't hear a damn thing. Tell him I'll call him back. - He doesn't want to talk to you either, he just wanted me to tell you to turn on channel seven. He said that you'd be very interested in what's going on. - You'd better not be wasting my time. - [Reporter] Caitland Montague who had moved out of the home of billionaire father Montgomery Montague lived alone under the name Caitland Ross. But it was only last night we learned of Ms. Montague kidnapping when her fathers chauffer Richard Gareth was forced to the side of the road and shot to death. Apparently arrangements have been made for a ransom to be delivered. And believing Montague was on his way from his mansion the kidnappers tried to intercept him. - Great. - Okay mate, take five. Ms. Caitland Ross. I've heard some wonderful things about you. - Thank you Mr. Bunch. - Please, please, call me dick. - I'm so happy to be apart of Visions Dick. It's such an awesome opportunity. - So tell me about yourself. - Well I guess what I am is just a small town girl with big city dreams. - [Reporter] Discovering he was not in his car but in fact coming from his boat house the kidnapper shot the chauffer and then fled. - Bury this film real deep. Yeah, yeah, this ones for export, she's gorgeous. Clients gonna love her. Manny, I want her out of here as soon as possible. - Okay. - [Reporter] Montague's maid Lucy Popus who narrowly escaped death herself later called police. She explained the confusion about Montague's where abouts was due to call forwarding. - That's nice, yeah that's real nice Darrel, you're inside watching television, I'm outside getting my ass shot! Twice. One guys got a bullet in him, another guys dead. I think it's time we get the cops in here. - We don't wanna do that. - What are we supposed to do, fly all over Iraq? - Caitland Montague is not in the Middle East. - New sources reveal that Ms. Montague's captors are demanding 20 million dollars for her release. Under her alis Caitland was trying to establish a career as a model. - Eric, she's been kidnapped. - God. Darrel, what the hell is going on? Does Montague know about this? - Not until a few minutes ago. I mean he just called and said they contacted him last night and he didn't want anyone to know. He was just gonna pay them ransom rather than risk her life but things got all screwed up and now it's leaked out to the press. He's getting desperate. - Did he talk to the FBI? - Yeah but I told him they would just screw everything up, they should leave him out of it. - Oh and this man listens to you? - Hey at least we have something to go on, okay we are closer than anyone on this thing. - [Reporter] About Caitland Montague's whereabouts please contact the Las Vegas police department. - You idiot. You were supposed to check her out. - Don't do that Dick. There's no way I could've known who she was. - If we could just-- - Oh really? Well apparently Amir was smart enough to figure it out. Look, just tell me exactly what you told her before you put her on the plane. - Same exact thing I tell all of them before I put them on the plane. I showed up at her door. I told her she had a job in London. She was peeing her pants she was so excited. I took her to the airport, I put her on the plane and that was it. 11 hours later I spoke to Amir, he said that she got there safely. - Jesus Christ, you are right. - Dude, I gotta get Sam out of there. - Nope, Eric please. She's the Growl Girl for Christ's sake. Don't, you'll blow our cover if you do that - So obviously she tells him who she is figuring out that would be her ticket on. And then of course, Amir, that double crossing little midget, kidnaps her and then tries to kill me. - That doesn't make any sense. Why would they try to kill you? - Because you don't kill the daughter of Montgomery Montague. Bastards rich enough to hunt you down for the rest of your life. - I don't get it. - Do you know what's going to happen when she gets home? She's going to tell the police how you and Visions tried to give her over to a bunch of ragged pimps. Oh you got it now have you? We know far too much. Yeah, I'm sure Amir figured he had no choice but to come on over here and kill us. - Kill you. - Oh, you was meant to be in that car to Manny. (shoe thuds) - What's that? All right, if they want to play hard ball, so can we. (bug crunches) - That's, dude that's the bug. Shit, come on, shit, they're less to bug. - Eric please. - They found the bug. - It's cool man, he thinks Amir planted it. - Eris please, just stay with it okay, okay we lost the bug. But this scum bag is gonna lead us right to Caitland. - I'm telling you right now, it's time to bring the cops in. - Man, no we got these suckers caught, if anybody else comes in they could fuck it all up. - Mean while what if something else goes wrong? - Eric, please I will get the cops in soon enough, I swear. But for now, let's just find Caitland, please? - Call Abib. - Why? - I want Amir's number in Las Vegas. I'm going to draft a letter explaining our entire operation, including our ties to Amir. I'm going to put this in a sealed envelope which you will hand deliver to my attorney. I will then make it very clear to Amir how dangerous I am to him dead which will make it-- - [Suzan] Dick? - Suzan you are interrupting. - Police are here and they want to talk to you right away. - I will be out soon, as I was saying it will make him even more receptive to the idea of a meeting with us. So, get ahold of Eric, I want this whole thing played down. We give the cops a statement and it's business as usual. Got it? - Got it. - Good. (dramatic music) - All the arrangements have been made. These are the instructions to the rendezvous point. We're to meet them. (phone rings) Hello? It's Dick Bunch - Hello? - Hey, hey are you okay? You disappeared on me. - Hey man, yeah, I was giving a statement down at the police station. Dick was convincing bro. He gave them this song and dance about how he didn't know anything, what was going on. Even I started to believe him. - What do you expect? - At this point anything goes, huh? - I'm glad you're all right. Listen, I'm calling to let you know I'll be staking out Visions tonight. If Dick's going to be making a move, it's going to be soon. You want to join me? - I can't man, Sam's coming over. - All right well I'll call you if anything goes down. - Yeah listen, you do me a favor, okay? You be careful Darrel. These guys, aren't having a pissing contest. - Look, I will call you before I do anything, all right? Hey, we're a team, right? - Absolutely man. Okay, listen someone's here, I gotta go. Okay buddy, bye bye. - Eric. Suzan told me what happened. Oh, I get so worried about you. You all right? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Listen, I um, great gig or not I don't think that you should go back to Visions. I'm not. I just care about you too much. - Okay. - Okay. (dramatic music) (phone beeps) - Sorry. I gotta go, sorry. - What is it? - You know my mom, she's been really sick, I told to page me if she needed me. - Okay, well. - Bad timing. - Tell her I hope she feels better. - I will. - I think I'm falling for her daughter. - I'll tell her. - Okay. - Bye. (suspenseful music) - Come on. - [Bunch] Did you get that letter to my attorney? - [Manny] Yeah. - [Bunch] Good. - Now what? - We go to the Palomino club and we sit tight. - [Manny] Why? - [Bunch] Cause they're gonna contact us there to tell us where the actual meeting with Amir is gonna take place. Okay? Well let's go. Don't look so nervous. (engine rumbles) (dramatic music) - Hello. - Eric, Darrel. Listen, I hope I'm not interrupting anything but. - No, no, that's all right, what's going on? You all right? Darrel you all right? - Yeah. Look I followed Dick, over to the Palomino club. Do you remember that guy we saw outside my window yesterday in the parking lot? - Yeah. - Yeah, well he's here to. - What's he doing? - So far he's just sitting at his car but I'm sure that's just temporary. It just seems every time this guy shows up the shit hits the fan, you know what I mean? - All right man listen, just sit tight, okay, I'm gonna be there in 15 minutes. - Thank you. - Get a grip Manny, everything's under control. Hello darling. - So what do we do now? - We wait. And we enjoy the entertainment. Okay? (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - Glad to see I did not underestimate your ability to perform. - I followed your instructions to the letter. Now where's my daughter? - And your daughter will be back soon. - That's not acceptable. Where is she? How do I know she's all right? If I'm not satisfied that she's all right you're going back empty handed. (suspenseful music) - Yes. He wishes to speak to her. (suspenseful music) - Caitland. - Daddy, I wanna come home daddy. - You all right? - Daddy please, I am so sorry. - Now just calm down, I'm here, I'm taking care of everything. - I'm sorry daddy. Just give them the money okay? I don't wanna die, I love you. I really love you. - I'll get you home safe, I promise. - Your daughter will be home safely in a few hours. - I'm gonna tell you something and I want you to listen very carefully. If my daughter is hurt or violated in any way, this money would mean a damn. You have no idea what I'm capable of. - What's going on? - Nothing yet. Our friend is right over there. He's been camping out ever since he got here. I've been watching both doors though. Dick and company are still inside. - What if they went out the back? (car door bangs) ♪ I want you to notice ♪ ♪ You're wrong again ♪ (dramatic music) ♪ I'll break the chain ♪ (dramatic music) There they are. - Looks like the others haven't shown up yet. Let's just stay out of sight and wait. ♪ I want you to notice ♪ ♪ It happened again ♪ ♪ I want you to notice ♪ ♪ You're wrong again ♪ (dramatic music) - Hey, hey, where you going, hey? - Sam? I guess your moms feeling better huh? - Look I can explain okay? This just isn't a good time. - That's all right, I don't think you need to explain, I think I understand. - It's not the way it look okay? Now please just get out of here. - You heard the lady, shove off, she's with me. - Hey look man, nobodies talking to you. So just keep drinking all right. - Eric. Go home, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Okay? - You're making a big mistake boy. - Eric, just calm down. - Sam. - You don't even know what's going on here. - Eric. Son of a bitch. - Your car is waiting for you out front gentlemen. - Let's go. - All right it's time to go buddy, it's time to leave. - Look this is my business all right? You guys just get lost. Sam. - All right, you want to be tough guy? - Oh my. - Get off me man. (whacking) (crying out) (dramatic music) - Come on Sam. Come on Sam. (engine rumbles) Come on. Damn it Sam. (dramatic music) (whacking) - You're a dead man now boy. (whacks) (man cries out) - Ray! Damn it. - Sam! Wait! - Believe me, I'll talk to you later, I'm sorry Eric. I'm sorry! - Are you involved in this? - Will you come on, they're getting away! Screw the hormones man, goddamn it you asshole. All right babe, go ahead, follow that town car. - [Eric] You fucking nuts man? Put that gun down. - Not a chance okay? I didn't wanna tell you this but just before Dick;s car blew up I saw your little sweetie pie here drive away with our mystery man. - He's my partner. Look Eric, I haven't been totally honest with you all right. What happened between us, that was real okay but I'm not a model. I work for the FBI. - The FBI? - Yes, it's true I've been assigned to find Caitland Montague and the kidnappers. - How would you know about the kidnapping? Monty just released the information today. - What are you talking about? - Darrel here is a private investigator, Darrel, tell her who you're working for man. - If you're following the kidnappers why are you chasing Bunch? - Cause the two are tied together. We've had Visions staked out for a long time now, we know Dick Bunch runs a white slavery operation. In fact we finally got the hard evidence we needed at the airport yesterday. We had agents on one of the planes to intercept the model Kathy Juno. Some bozo must have screwed up the whole operation by calling the local police. - Yeah it's amazing how one jerk off can spoil everything, isn't it? - Yeah. Anyway Montague contacted us a week ago and gave us pictures of his daughter. We saw them as shots of a Visions model, Caitland Ross. That's when I went in as a model. We knew eventually Dick would lead us to Caitland. You know I talked to Montague my self, he never mentioned anything about hiring a detective. - He didn't actually personally hire me. - Wait, wait, wait a second, what are you talking about? - Well you know I was independently working for him. - Wait a minute, what do you mean independently? - I was trying to get the reward. - The what? - The reward, the reward okay, the reward. - There's a reward? - Yes. The Montague's may not have been all that cozy to each other but old Monty still put up a million bucks to find her. - A million dollars? A million dollars? Darrel you told me 150 bucks, you told me you were gonna pay me 150 bucks. - Damn it, where are they? Damn it. (suspenseful music) - Bro I was gonna split it with you 50 50 I just didn't want to say anything in case we didn't find her. I swear. Bro it's me. (suspenseful music) - What the hell are these guys doing here? - It's a long story Ray. So what's the status? - They just entered that warehouse. (suspenseful music) - The backups are on the way. You guys stay here. In the meantime I'm going to check things out. Don't move. - [Sam] Okay. (hatch rattles) (suspenseful music) - Open it. (case clicks) (suspenseful music) - Mr. Charm. (suspenseful music) - Follow me. (suspenseful music) - Stay here guys. (suspenseful music) - Amir old son. Now we had a great relationship, I'm very disappointing you decided to screw it up. - 20 million dollars is good enough reason to screw up relationship. - Montague's a very powerful man, messing around with him could get you killed. - His daughter will be returned unharmed. - And talking of killing, you tried to do me in, didn't you? To cover your tracks eh? - That was poor judgment on my part. Look. 20 million dollars is good enough reason for us to all disappear, very, very rich. - [Bunch] Well personally speaking I don't want to disappear. I'd sooner that the old girl shag every agency in the world looking for us. - Well you're not calling the shots here Mr. Bunch. Let's just reason this out. That letter to your attorney would grieve us greatly, as would your sudden demise. I'm sure we can come to terms. - Don't count on it. All right now, I'll be the once calling the shots. You move. Come on Manny, let's get the girl. Here, she's in here. (suspenseful music) - Okay, the girl dies. - Yeah? She'll have company. - This is going to be hard enough. We need to work together. - Don't bet on it. Manny, get the girl. - Dick he's right, we need to think about this. - I'll do the thinking you dumb shit, just get the bitch. Go on. Don't even think about that. - Mr. Bunch what do you get out of killing us? - I'll sleep a lot better. (Manny whacks) (Dick cries out) - [Amir] No don't kill him, the letter. - Oh that's right, the letter, the letter to the attorney, right. This letter. - What the hells going on? - [Amir] You should treat your people better Mr. Bunch. When Manny found out the girl was Caitland Montague he came to us, not you. - Manny I treated you good. - You treated me like shit Dick. - Listen we've been through a lot together, now don't team up with them jokers. You're much better than that. - Oh I'm not teaming up with them Dick. (gun fires) - Oh! - But I'm not teaming up with you either. You really think I'm stupid don't you? She never made it to the plane Dick. And you'd be surprised how easy it was to get these idiots to extort millions of dollars from her old man. - Okay, than you got your money eh? Well there's no need to kill me to. - Oh no see Caitland Ross left a gleaming trail right to your front door step Dick. It's gotta end there, I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do about that. They're just gonna have to find what's left of all of you in the charred remains of this unsafe old warehouse. - But they'll know that you've run off with the money, they'll be looking for ya. - Oh no, you see I'll just scatter a couple piles of money around. It'll be worth loosing a couple of million, don't you think? To make sure that Montague and the cops sop looking for me. That's it you see? They'll have the kidnappers. They'll think the money burned in the fire and sweet little Caitland will be at home, safe and sound. - Excuse me Manny, you are not thinking this thing through. - She can still identify you. (gun fires) (Dick cries out) - I am not the idiot you think I am. (dick crying out) - Guys come on. - Can't believe this guy. - [Darrel] Come on, come on. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) - We can't go back out the same way we came in. - So what do we do? - I'll check it out. - Ms. Montague, I'm Darrel Chism. I'm the guy who's rescuing you, Darrel Chism, C-H-I-- - Will you shut up? You're scaring her. (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (Ray cries out) - You guys stay here. - Hey, watch her. (suspenseful music) - Shit, Eric doesn't have a gun. - Who are you guys. - Just stay here, don't move a muscle okay, don't move. Chism. (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) - Oh God. Come on. (dramatic music) (whacks) (suspenseful music) (whacking) (crying out) - Hold it! - It's over Manny. - FBI. - Caitland. Caitland, don't do it. He's not worth the Caitland. - Everybody drop them. - No, you don't understand. - Yes I do understand, every body drop them. - Thanks for showing up. Give me that, get over there. Move, put it down! Get over there. You. (whacks) (cries out) Get over there by your friends. Get down. (whacks) (cries out) I said get down, move. - What do we do with him? - Tie him up. - Caitland, he's scum, you don't want to do this. - [Manny] Shut up. - Manny is the best thing that ever happened in my life. - Sure, it takes some one real special to help you screw over your own father. - I'm not screwing him, he screwed me. - [Manny] Shut up. - My father never gave a shit about me. So when he couldn't control me, he cut me off. That 20 million dollars is mine! - Shut up! (suspenseful music) Babe you know what to do right? You go down the road, you call the police, and you tell them you just barely go tout of here, Cait. You with me? - Yeah Manny, I'm with ya. - You're sick, pathetic. - Shut up! (suspenseful music) - Oh shit, hurry up, tie him up, hurry up, we gotta get out of here! (suspenseful music) - Now Manny that is really stupid. Drop those guns or I'll drop this and blow us all away. (suspenseful music) Now I want you to, I want you to-- (suspenseful music) - Got it! (suspenseful music) (gun fires) - [Caitland] Manny! No, no! (suspenseful music) - Come on, let's go! (Caitland crying) (suspenseful music) - Now, come on! Come on! (warehouse booms) - Holy smokes. (warehouse booming) - Woo wee. - Whoa. - You have the right to remain silent, you give up the right to remain silent anything-- - Anything I say can and will be used against me in a court of law, yeah, yeah, yeah. Been there, done that. - Well let's do it again. - Hey, hey, easy, easy. - What, what? - Easy man, easy. - Hey, hey. Don't think I'm forgetting about my reward! We got the money, we go this daughter back. It's not my fault she's a conniving bitch! (dramatic music) - [Sam] Hey. - Hey. - Whoa, impressive you guys really did it. - Yeah, thanks to the reward money. - Darrel, I had no idea you knew a thing about advertising. - Well I don't but what did I know about being a detective, right? - Oh thank God those days are over. - Amen. - Yeah, actually Darrel's doing great. Just got us the Muan Hotel account. - Hey, congratulations. - Thank you. Which reminds me. You two crazy kids better hurry up and get going. You have an appointment with them at two. - Okay, we'll see you buddy. - Bye Darrel. So what do you want for lunch? - I don't know, where should we go? - How about my place, we could start with dessert. - Sargent Harris please. Thanks. (dramatic music) Jack, Darrel. Listen, you know those Italians you're trying nail for counterfeiting? Yeah, are they still offering reward? Really? Well, guess how I'm meeting with today at two o'clock? Right, right. Yeah, I think I can get right inside their operation but I'm gonna need your help. Yeah, easy as pie. (dramatic music)
