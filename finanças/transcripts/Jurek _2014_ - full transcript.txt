Do not occupy yourself with idle matters. Foolishness and pettiness pull you down. Do not give up. Hold on tight to the peak with your claws. Climb the mountains. Do the great things.

Kukuczka. Jurek Kukuczka. Jerzy Kukuczka, an outstanding Polish alpinist, by many considered the best in the history of high-altitude climbing died in the attempt of ascending the southern face of the Lhotse peak in Himalayas. He was one of the two people who climbed 14 highest world mountain peaks, and the first to ever achieve that in a record time of 8 years. During the 1988 Winter Olympics Jerzy Kukuczka was awarded an honorary Olympic medal. It's a rare thing to find a boy from a working-class family who becomes the best in the world alpinism. Mountains for us were a way of life. Our own choice. It wasn't that we had a whim to travel to these places. No. Mountains completely took control of our bodies and minds. Sometimes we need to face difficulties, to be on the edge. The edge of life and death. Maybe this would make our everyday, city lives more colourful. We were raised in a working-class neighbourhood. Our family of five shared one room with a kitchen. When we grew a bit older our parents divided the room to get more space, but it was a tiny place. He was always allowed to get away with more, because he was the family's favourite. Jurek was a highlander, but he lived in Katowice Bogucice, where people spoke in Silesian dialect. Here children would end up as labour force in the industry. Only richer people could afford sending their children to a high school. Less fortunate children would go to trade schools. He wouldn't join us for a breakfast. He was studying hard. And he attained his end. He graduated. He met a beautiful girl, Mariola. As he was walking her home, one day, he was attacked by three men in the train station tunnel. Jurek was fighting fair-play, but when they ripped off his sleeve Jurek taught them the lesson. One of the attackers ended up with a broken arm, and the other two said that they took Jurek for somebody else. I didn't start climbing the mountains to become a professional, or to openly share experiences with others. No. I never planned it that way. I did it all only for myself. I wanted it to be a personal thing. It was the first Sunday of September, 1965. I recall this moment very well. It was the first time I saw others climbing. And it was first time that I ever climbed. The trainees were allowed to choose their own route. We all stood by a crag that could be walked around by the left side. This is how we normally did it. The trainees chose to climb the edge. Two of them failed, but Kukuczka managed to reach the top using almost only his hands. He appeared to be a speedy, hearty man with a strong handhold, but it was too soon to tell if he'd be a good high mountain climber. People said Jurek wasn't cut for it. He was tough climber but would fail in heights. These were the opinions about him. In 1974 we went on an expedition to Alaska, where he suffered severe frostbite. My first encounter with a relatively high altitude was a 6100m Mount McKinley. It was horrible. It was the first time I ever suffered an altitude sickness and barely reached the peak. It was only with my willpower that I managed to reach the top. When they asked us why we felt so good up there we'd say there's so little oxygen in our polluted Silesia that we were well adjusted to breathe the diluted oxygen in the mountains. Towards the end of the 70's we had the best team ever. There were many high elevation jobs. There were plenty industrial chimneys here. We would find a rusty chimney and tell the plant's manager that if he wouldn't have it painted it would collapse in three years. We offered him a new, cheaper method which didn't require putting up a scaffold. The manager pretended that he needed some time to think it over, but he was already rubbing his hands with satisfaction. The money we earned fed into the club's budget. With the money we bought provision, tents, sleeping bags, and down jackets. That's how it all started. Normally, there was a proposal before a marriage, but Jurek was very shy and he didn't know how to go about it. There was a doorbell ring and my sister opened the door. Jurek was so frightened that he gave her the flowers, instead of me. Before every trip I'd ask him if he really had to go. I wanted him to stay home. There were so many things that needed taking care of together. Once he set his mind on going there was no way back for him. If you really want to climb a mountain you will do everything to achieve that. When your motivation is low you start to find excuses and back out. For me it's just justifying one's weaknesses. -Is that so interesting? -Yes, it is. You're right. It's a proof for everybody back home that daddy does take a bath sometime. Our first adventure began in 1977. It was the Nanga Parbat expedition. It was his first eight-thousander, and the first Himalayan trip for Jurek. We were ascending the Rupal Face, the greatest alpine wall in the world, which stretches up to 5,5 km. Things turned bad for us. We were in bad physical condition, and we got frostbite. But it was him who led the whole team and he didn't give up, working himself to death. There was a special thing about Jurek, that Wojtek Kurtyka described as pain endurance. He endured low temperatures, exhaustion and altitudes. He could withstand it all. Jurek climbed Lhotse without bottled oxygen. He hadn't been sure about it at first, because none of us had ever been at this altitude before. In the morning Jurek and Andrzej Czok unexpectedly left the oxygen behind and gave it a try. Ignoring bottled oxygen at these altitudes is a stupid and senseless idea, and it's putting one's health and life at risk. Are you showing off or making things more difficult for you? Isn't the mountain itself difficult enough? When you can ascend the mountain without oxygen, then using supplemental oxygen is a redundant convenience. It's also unfair towards the mountain. The harder the better was a rule that was around for decades, before becoming obsolete by the end of the 80's. Now the rule is: the easier the better. The stereotype of a romantic Pole capable only of romantic upsurges is fading away now. A new image of a Pole is emerging. He's now a builder of huge steelworks, factories and harbours, and is now among the best shock workers of the world. In 1979 Jurek's performance was very high, and Jurek found himself in Andrzej Zawada's national Everest expedition. As he couldn't go in the winter time he went during the summer. We made a first winter ascent on Mount Everest, and this summer we established a new Polish route. We're talking with Andrzej Czok and Jerzy Kukuczka. I was really amazed that during this expedition the whole team worked well together. All 10 climbers reached the 5th camp. When he returned from the Everest trip his company had decided to fire him, because he spent too much time away from his workplace. In Warsaw they were welcomed with celebration by many press agencies. Katowice TV station decided to do a special coverage titled: "The return of the champion to his workplace." As Jurek arrived at the company the TV crew was waiting for him. The minute the company's director saw them he approached Jurek and told him that he wouldn't be fired after all. Accept my congratulations and wishes of success in the future. Thank you very much. -My congratulations again. -Thank you. I would like to thank you for providing the conditions in which I can cultivate my passion for climbing. My pleasure. Mr. Jurek, I hope that future decorations and diplomas would also be handed -to you at this company. -Thank you. I'm in good spirits since the morning I'm smiling to the people in the street It's nice when the shop assistant recognises me. She sells you a good quality meat from under-the-counter. Yes, that's true. He was going on an expedition and needed food provisions. If you knew anyone from the staff, preferably the manager, you'd be able get large amounts of Swiss cheese and sausages. One day someone noticed I was illegally expediting the food for the boys. The line of people rushed to steal the food for which they waited in long queues. I'm not worried by no petty thing I got a feeling it will be a wonderful day To get the food from under-the-counter was a privilege. Damn it. Get him away from there. This crystal just cost me a week stay at the Kathmandu hotel. The best way was to play a smuggler. You'd bring the stuff as gifts across the border and then sell it in Kathmandu. The money would be then paid to porters who carried our equipment up the mountains. Everybody smuggled, for a long time back. All sportsmen did. Himalayan mountaineers had the best smuggling opportunities, because back then their whole equipment was shipped in lorries. Smuggling is practically unlimited with a 5-ton lorry. Everything was well organised. The expedition equipment could go to scrap in 90% of its volume. We written in a scrap report that the equipment had fallen in a crevasse or was buried by an avalanche. This way we kept 4 extra tents, 8 sleeping bags, 6 tape recorders, and 15 crystal vases which were supposed to be gifts. "The equipment fell in a deep crevasse without chances of recovery." I well remember this phrase. Some say that on one of the expeditions 5 fridges were smuggled to Nepal. Military Council acting in accordance with the Constitution introduced martial law on the whole territory of the country at midnight. He continued mountaineering during the martial law. Martial law or not it didn't matter. Where there's a will there's a way. Female climbing expeditions set off during the martial law. When the guys had passport problems they simply joined the women. Jurek had this typical Silesian patriarchal approach. His wife would stay home, while he was away climbing mountains. Sometimes I asked him to take me with him. I just wanted to see the mountains, the eight-thousanders. He'd never take me there. He'd say that women distract him in the mountains. We wanted to climb Gasherbrum I and II, but we only had a permit to climb the first one. We had planned ahead to make ascents on both of them. When we reached the camp we had to convince the liaison officer to let us climb Gasherbrum II. The Pakistanis were very strict about illegal ascents on their mountains. We figured out the way to trick the officer. We created a feeling of a deadly avalanche danger on Gasherbrum I. The officer Pirsa Dikszach, grew so overwhelmed that he decided to help us in our difficult situation. Listen Pirsa, how about climbing Gasherbrum II instead? Look, there's a ridge and rocks. We will be safe there. Of course, you should try Gasherbrum II. No problem. -We're going get into trouble. -What trouble? I'm your host here. I'm your lord and master here. You have the permission to go on Gasherbrum II. We welcomed his hospitality and made the ascent on Gasherbrum II. And afterwards, we climbed the Gasherbrum I via new route. Diplomatic conflict was close, but it finally blew over. This is their bathroom. Their next bath is in two months. Expeditions periods were the most peaceful time of my life. I had no contact with my family. I didn't care what went on out there in the world. It was a chill out time for me. Jurek almost never touched hashish. We gave it a little try, but stuck with vodka, which we preferred way more, especially Jurek. He could hold his liquor and often saved me from trouble. You shouldn't get too high You shouldn't get to high We all wanted to meet new people. After dinner we'd talk and laugh for hours. We came from a long isolated country and we looked for meeting other people. Wojtek. This way. Come here, Wojtek. Come on, let's go home. Be careful, hold on tight. There's an abyss before you. Watch out for an avalanche! Luckily it missed us. -We're not scared of avalanches. -No, we're not. We're coming to the southern mountain pass. You see this beautiful buttress, there? We're going to climb it. It will be the Polish route. He took his son's favourite ladybird toy on Makalu expedition. After his lone climb Jurek reported it, but no one believed that he did it on his own in this weather and by that route. So his climb was not recorded. When I reached the Makalu's summit, in 1982, I found a strange turtle toy. It had a red back with black spots and it had an envelope attached to it. It contained a letter from a Polish climber, Jerzy Kukuczka. It said that he reached Makalu's summit before me. A year ago. I wrote him a letter of congratulations. Kukuczka had a problem with registering his Makalu ascent. My letter proved that he indeed reached this peak. It turned out that the weird Polish creature I found wasn't a turtle, but some ladybird. We don't have those in Korea. Some say that climbing comes from one's complexes, and that's seeking substitute achievements. -There are people who believe that. -Yes and they're right. And it's beautiful. A man is a restless soul, always seeking new experiences. Our complexes lower our self-esteem, so we sail out onto the world's open waters to redefine ourselves. It was Carlo's and mine first eight-thousander, so the team didn't count on us much. Once there was this spot on our way. We had to sit like on a horse, and move up foot by foot. There were 3 km of empty space around us and there wasn't anything we could secure ourselves to with a rope. Jurek would take decisions like that. Once in order to cross between two seracs we had to make a swing. The swing was 50 metres wide. Jurek wasn't scared at all. It took us 3 or 4 times before we fixed a rope to the serac. We used it to create a bridge. We learned through the portable radio that Piotrek Kalmus had an accident. He had been found dead on the glacier. Cancelling the expedition would've been pointless, because Piotrek couldn't be helped anyway. Failed expedition with a fatality would've been a total disaster. We couldn't keep track of time, because our brain didn't work properly at that altitude. We were physically exhausted. I even took photos of myself for others to remember my face before my death. When I reached the top Carlos was lying down and Kukuczka sitting. We weren't euphoric at all, because we were dead tired. We were happy it was all over. Each alpinist ascent has a limit of rational decisions to be taken around it. This expedition exceeded all boundaries of any alpinist experience. It was like a Russian roulette. I can't lead a secure, family life and relax all the time. After a while I need to leave again, take that risk, work and only afterwards come home tired. Jurek couldn't find an equally strong partner for him. His last equal was Wojtek Kurtyka. They both made an impact on the Himalayan mountaineering, especially in Karakorum where their achievements were great. Our worldview on the mountains, opinions on alpinist's diet, film, music or aesthetics were different. There was nothing we shared in common. If it was a team of two Kukuczkas they'd kill each other after one season. If there were two Kurtykas they'd never be able to climb any mountain peak. Jurek had this saying: "Once the mountain's been paid for you must climb it." All expeditions would leave except for Jurek. "I paid the climbing permition and I'm supposed to leave?" He didn't care about avalanche danger or bad weather. "Once the mountain's been paid for, you must climb it." On the third day due to serious technical problems we didn't progress in the summit cone and we were forced to descend to the nearest camp. While rappelling down one of my crampons detached and fell down. I was shocked that Jurek wanted to continue the climb. He said: "We were going to make it, someway dude". That's how he was. He made it clear that if I gave up he'd go on his own. In these hopeless circumstances I agreed and went on with him. It was a foolish decision. It was completely irrational. After covering about 50-100 metres Jurek shouted: "Look, it's unbelievable!" Jurek has found my crampon. A lot depends on your luck in the mountains, so you have to be lucky. If you're not lucky you shouldn't be going. It's a basic thing - to be lucky. I tried to convince Jurek to climb Gasherbrum IV. He didn't like the idea at first. It’s a huge, steep wall. I was terrified. Finally, I convinced myself to give it a try. Once he set his mind on this idea he was determined beyond any limits. It was madness. He wanted to go despite bad weather conditions... which posed a deadly threat for us. He was getting detached from reality. When I was convinced about the idea Wojtek said: "Fuck it, I'm not going." With the regular afternoon snow fall climbing this wall was just pure madness. At some point I felt we reached a wall with Wojtek. Jurek expected from everybody exactly the same toughness he did from himself. You have to know what hunger feels like, experience it. You need to suffer hunger for 5 days to appreciate the taste of stale bread. And this is how you search for that taste in your grey life. All the best with your current and future plans, and have a good holiday. I guess we've just interrupted your holidays? I just returned with my family from my cabin, in Istebna. Sadly, the holidays were planned short and they were even shorter. I terribly missed Jurek, because he'd go away very often and for very long periods. I was very young at that time and needed him very much. I had to take care of my sons on my own. I looked after our two houses. I had very little private time for myself. I always thought of him as a tough person, so I tried to be the same, and never give up. He rarely told me about the mountains, or his team partners. He never talked about the accidents. Perhaps he didn't want to upset us. Maybe he knew I would've fought even more against him leaving. You rarely talk about fatalities during the expeditions, or recall someone's death. You try to suppress these most tragic moments, especially in the mountains, where you avoid talking about danger. Andrzej Czok and Jurek had a lot in common. Andrzej was very strong and vigorous. There was nothing that would break him. We weren't aware that Andrzej was developing an altitude sickness. We agreed the previous night that Jurek and I would set off for the top first, and Andrzej and Przemek would wait for us. We'd take turns once we returned. Jurek and Krzysztof didn't even ask how bad it was with Andrzej. In fear of being forced to stay due to Andrzej's critical situation. They put their individual interest over their concern for their teammate. Near the peak Kukuczka decided to radio the base, but he couldn't find the batteries. They dematerialised. Back at the camp he put his hand in the backpack and found the batteries. They somehow materialised there. He had broken communication with the base just in case. If Andrzej's state had gone worse they would've been ordered to stop the climb and bring the sick friend down to the camp. When we returned to the tent they were gone. We knew something bad happened. In the morning, returning to the camp was the only viable option. Time worked against him, as he got weaker and weaker. The last hundreds of metres we had to bring him down in his sleeping bag, because he was so weak. I dozed off for a moment and when I woke up Andrzej was dead. He passed away very quietly, unnoticeably. Is ethics code different up there, in the mountains? No. It is the same as here on the ground. Do we have the right to wilfully endanger our lives, and put ourselves in situations where we lose our compassion? For instance, when we're unable to help other climbers, because we're physically exhausted? A passage from a letter, written by Tadeusz from the K2 camp on June 29th 1986: "Majority of the teams gave up their original, ambitious plans and followed their footsteps onto the familiar paths. Me and Jurek decided to stick to the primary idea, and climb the south-eastern wall. If the weather is favourable, we will steadily make it to the summit and back." On this day we only drank a cup of water from the snow we melted over a candle fire. This was our whole breakfast. Visibility is closing down. We're hurrying up. I only knew we've reached the peak, because there's no further way up. A few minutes later Tadeusz joined me. There was no time for celebration, because there was a long way back. It was the only expedition I was sure he was coming back from. I was pregnant then and my child didn't deserve to be an orphan, before she was even born. I was going down first, with Tadeusz behind me. It was an easy passage, before we reached a steep fault. There were 15-20 metres between us. I saw one of his crampons fell off. As Tadeusz moved the second crampon fell off, too. In my whole life I never saw that both crampons which solely held him on this ice block would simply detach. He screamed: "Jurek, I don't know what to do." I saw him sliding down directly on me. I grabbed my ice-axes and plunged them deep in the snow. Then he fell on me with all his weight. After a while, I don't know how long it was, I looked around and noticed Tadeusz limply sliding down and vanishing beyond the edge, hundreds of metres down. Did I do everything to prevent this tragedy? Was it my error or his? Could this tragedy have been anticipated? I always ask myself these questions. And hardly find the answers. I often find faults in my actions. Is it a burden for you? Yes, It is. Why do you keep going back? Let's have a break. When Jurek returned he was very jittery. He saw the condition I was in. This must've been difficult for him. I could only wish him luck with his next expeditions. I didn't want anything bad to happen to him as it did to Tadeusz. I wished him to return from his voyages to his wife and his children, safely. The high number of casualties in heights proves my theory that climbing is a senseless thing. From an ordinary man's perspective climbing must be absurd. And it is. A man is the only creature on Earth who does excessive things. We need to have higher values which guide us in life, although sometimes they may appear unreasonable. Is mounting-climbing a higher value? Yes it is, because it is a contrast to our ordinary lives. It's an added value, but something we could all do without. And still many of us do it. With prices constantly rising all of you are forced to find sponsorship to finance your another expeditions. Your sponsors now own the pictures of you posing on the summit, and they rob you of your souls. That's absolutely right. -I'm not rich enough. -None of you are. None of us is rich enough to finance our own expeditions. We're forced to partially sell ourselves. I'd like to benefit from this fact. In the second half of the 80's I was a Minister of Sport. We were all thrilled by the race between Kukuczka and Messner. We were a poorer country and our resources were humbler too. There was already a whole financial machine of companies, along with the media. Who were supporting Messner. He was a real celebrity. Jurek Kukuczka was this humble and stubborn Pole who wanted to outclass Messner in this race and even beat him in time. Kukuczka was dead serious about the competition with Messner. He wanted to be the first to climb all eight-thousanders. We were never opponents. We never competed. I wouldn't call it a rivalry. They both denied they competed with each other. The media initiated the race and they both picked up this play. The competition did exist. It's a big party at which Reinhold Messner is celebrating climbing all 14 eight-thousanders. He had to rush in this pursue, as Jurek was treading on his heels for two years. The man from Tyrol has made it, and will always be the titleholder. Messner won the race, but Kukuczka was no doubt better. In order to distinguish himself from Messner Kukuczka intentionally chose to climb the eight-thousanders either in winter or by alternative routes. I sent him a short telegram after his final 14th ascent. "My congratulations on winning the grand slam". -Did he respond? -He sent me a short telegram, too. What was the telegram? "You are not second. You are great". son I'm not thinking about my father all the time when I'm walking the streets in Nepal. He's for sure a small part of my life, but I never knew him personally. I learnt about him a little from the books and other sources. I figured him out good, but I don't know who he really was. Shishapangma is located in Tibet and for many years was unreachable for the Western climbers. The key to the successful expedition lay in huge money. Jurek was looking hard to get a permit to climb Shishapangma. The English expedition who went before us paid the Chinese 69 thousand pounds. There was a visit of the Chinese Sports Minister in Katowice. With the help of the local government Jurek invited himself to the party. There he was introduced to the minister. We had an idea to invite the Chinese delegation to Poland. And ask them if their visit expenses would partially cover the costs of our expedition. We hosted the delegation of the Chinese Ministry of Sports for 14 days. We evaluated the cost of their stay respectively to the costs of the alpinist expeditions to Tibet. That'd be 500 dollars for a hotel per day or 10 dollars per kilometre in taxi. The visit totalled 100 thousand dollars and it equated the cost of our expedition to Tibet. The trip cost us no money at all. The expedition medic Lech Korniszewski and the girls surprised him with 14 traditional regional dumplings with 14 paper flags with the names of all the mountain peaks he climbed. It was their welcome present. I don't know if he can do it... If he's allowed to do it. Now I can do anything I want. Zip up. Tasty dumplings. I always rejected the thought that some day he might not be coming back. I had these thoughts, but I tried to reject them. He always promised: "Don't worry. I am coming back." Soviets go home! Soviets go home! Following several months of difficult preparations, which can be understood as breaking the ice, we finally meet by the round table. There is only one winner, the people. Our country. Soviets go home! Soviets go home! You made 14 ascents on eight-thousanders. Only you and Messner achieved that. This could be your career ending accomplishment. Why are you going to climb so difficult, southern face of Lhotse? "What the hell are you going there again for?" "I can't sit still any longer." I told him to stay home and enjoy his pork knuckle with horseradish and take care of his kids and wife. "This is the last time I'm going," he said. All right, get down. Hello, mom. I'm a bit late. -Where do I write that? -Just write x equates and copy that. Do I write the result or calculate it in a column? If you don't know the result you have to do it in a column. We were all egoists. Jurek was also an egoist. -How were you egoists? -We were chasing our dreams, our passion. -Is that bad? -It's a good question. I can't answer this question, because I was taking part in that, as well. -Do you have any regrets? -No, I don't. I think Jurek never regretted following his path of life. Yes, we are egoists. Everybody is. Sailors are. The great navigators from the medieval times were also egoists. They dedicated their whole lives to accomplishing of their goals. In a way I abandoned Jurek for half a year, because I had accepted an invitation from Rheinhold Messner to the expedition on the southern face of Lhotse. Messner wanted to climb Lhotse - the biggest challenge of the 20th century. He failed. It was sickening. The media exploited the success of Kukuczka, because they needed new successes. We're going to follow the expedition of Kukuczka and his friends, who are armed with foreign climbing equipment, and who will sleep in Polish tents on pillows made from Polish geese. Will you be the first one on the top, or will you let your teammates do it? Are you going to bring a rock chip as gift for your sponsors? What is your team management strategy? Are you going to seek positive predictions about your trip with astrologers and horoscope writers? There are 13 members of your team. I hope it will be your lucky 13 and that you're not superstitious. Aren't you afraid that someone from your team might die? -Are you terrified much about going? -Every expedition is spiked with anxieties. I have a lot of them. It was the first time our team was made of accidental members. It wasn't a well-knit team, we didn't know each other well. We didn't have financial problems, it was the human factor thing. There are TV crews everywhere. They're everywhere. I'm going climbing tomorrow and I hope the TV people won't follow. It's a great adventure for us. We're finally setting off and we'll have some time to relax. There were Polish and Italian TV crews on the spot, along with accompanying staff. There was a small number of climbers. Why are you going there? What are you looking for there? What do you feel when you've reached the peak? What do you do when your teammate dies? You're selling yourself. What do you do when you friend dies? In fact, I'm selling myself, my feelings. I'm forced to say all these things. I don't want to do this. If this is a professional climber life then I'm quitting. I said to him: Remember about us, come back, We're all waiting for you. He said: Don't worry. Take care of the kids. We hugged, he rushed to the train and I never saw him again. I wonder how's my family doing, how's my wife, my sons. I've left them with so many problems. Everybody followed the tv and radio news about the Himalayan expedition. We hoped to learn anything. If God allows it, the weather's good and if we have a stroke of luck then maybe we're going to make it. Kukuczka told us his plan which was much more ambitious then originally planned. He decided to go in an alpine style, by a new route, and without setting camps. The old way wasn't enough for him. The problem was he didn't find a partner. I told him I liked his idea, but found it a bit too risky, and offered the traditional way, which guaranteed our way back. It would be a success, anyway. It's two teams of 5 people in total to go up this route. Try to reach the 3rd station and we're going for the 4th. The weather was beautiful and chances of reaching the top and returning safely were great. I woke up from a bad dream in the middle of the night. I dreamt I was collecting Jurek's personal belongings. I had a feeling that something bad has happened. I looked toward the wall and noticed a person descending. Then I knew I was right about my dream. There were no lengthy reports on the accident. Maybe a few lines. We cut through the traverse up to 8 thousand metres and Jurek was in the lead. Right before the accident he'd been setting placements in the slab covered with snow. I noticed him sliding down. It appeared to be nothing dangerous. With the placements set below you you can slide down, or even fall off the wall and nothing bad should happen to you. Jurek ripped off the first placement, and then gained falling speed. The situation became critical. At some point he fell past me hitting against the rock. The only thing I could do was to nestle to block the rope. Then came a severe jolt of the rope on the stance. The rope snapped just above the stance, against the sharp granite edge. He was lucky the rope snapped, because they would've both fallen down. It all looked like in a movie. I see him falling off the rock and falling down, and there's his glove tumbling down, hitting against the rock. I knew he was going to die. I was still tied to the remaining piece of rope. Normally, you dispose of it, afterwards. At that time I didn't think whether to keep the snapped piece or not. It's a different thing to be down there on the safe ground. When you're up there and your life is in danger you have to save yourself. Ryszard Pawłowski, Kukuczka's partner: I'm holding it against you. How could you have let him fall off that wall? We reported that Jurek's body had been found and buried so that Jurek's family could claim compensation. Otherwise, his status would be missing and his family wouldn't get any social benefits. We couldn't allow this to happen. At the mountain film festival in Katowice, in 1991, they organised a table at which sat all the climber's widows. I could see the wives of Piotrowski, Heinrich and Kukuczka. I was more shocked by the sight of all those widows, than by all these deaths in the mountains. Why did all these women have to go through so much suffering? The deaths of five of the Mount Everest climbers in the spring of 1989, Jurek and Wanda Rutkiewicz, coincided with the social and political changes in Poland. It all led to formation of the generation gap. I've noticed that people began climbing for pleasure to take a picture on the top against a beautiful landscape. The Polish people don't bring the national flag with themselves, anymore. Why did you decide to climb such difficult southern face of Lhotse? Why should I quit when I'm doing so well?
