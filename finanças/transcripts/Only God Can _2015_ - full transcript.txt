Grady, Grady. There you are. Hey, mail these to the Holy City Heartbreakers. Better get a move on. Grady. Oh hey Andre. You still driving Coley? More like she's driving me. You wouldn't be the first. Nope. Hello. Whoa. Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. Not used to seeing you here on Tuesdays. Everything alright? Oh, yes, no, I mean I should be sitting here praying but I'm just thinking. Pastor Rodney, would you have a minute to talk? Of course. Let me sit over here and you tell me what's on your mind. Every year my college sorority has a reunion. Okay. Holy City Heartbreakers, hoo, sounds more like a roller derby team than a sorority. Well, that's just what we called ourselves. Charleston is the holy city and we weren't a sorority, we were just a bunch of girls who hung out together. Says here you were the cougars, too. That is the College of Charleston's mascot. The famous fighting cougars. This sounds like it's gonna be one heck of a weekend. Stop it, seriously. Last year, I decided I was never gonna go again. They all just act like a bunch of silly teenagers and make me feel like I don't fit in and when I try to talk about my faith, it's like, well, like you Italians say, forget about it. I guess that's what the Italians would say but my family is Portuguese but please go on. Oh no. Well they just make fun of me, harass me, bring up stories from the past. Well, I don't think God expects you to go anywhere where you feel foolish and don't fit in. True. But then there's Gracie. You would love Gracie. She just recently became a Christian. She's the sweetest little thing, mother to three girls. I can't let an innocent sheep like that go to the wolves by herself. I mean, not that my friends are wolves, well Coley maybe, well she's just crazy fun but she has a drinking problem and it's destroyed most of her life. I know what that's like. Often happens to people who drink obsessively. Yeah and everybody sees it but nobody says anything. They just egg her on. It's like, Patrice just makes it worse which is so crazy because when Patrice isn't with us, she's a totally different person. She's very politically active and she's a poet and she thinks that white men have suppressed society and Coley thinks men make the world go round. Well don't we? Hardly. And then there's Glen. Glen, okay well whoa wait, let's slow down here a second. So there's Glen, so you've got a guy in a sorority too? No, Glen is a woman. She's incredible. She does more for people than most Christians I know but she thinks that doing good deeds is what puts you into heaven. I wonder where she read that. Let me ask you a question. When you were in college, were you a Christian? Well I was raised in the church but I didn't feel a personal connection and then when I got to college temptation was everywhere and I fell in with the wrong crowd, drinking, things I'm not proud of but by the time my senior year came around I got involved with Campus Crusade for Christ and I've been walking with the Lord ever since. You have an amazing testimony, you do and you know what I think? I think you've already made up your mind about going. I have? I think you have and I know finances are tight. You got a babysitter for the weekend? But I'll find one. Boy, you know I sure could use two more helping hands around here. You mean the same helping hands that set off the fire extinguisher in the prayer meeting last week? You'd be doing me a favor. I've got to visit my nieces and nephews in a couple weeks, I need the practice. Are you sure? Yeah, absolutely. Pastor Rodney, thank goodness I found you, Emily Campbell's on the phone, her mother's taken a turn for the worse. Family'd like to speak with you. Okay, excuse me. I'll pray for you. So make arrangements for the boys. Arrangements, the boys? Yeah, Sara's boys. Her boys? I'll be watching 'em for the weekend. Oh bless your heart, pastor. Isn't that nice? You love Pastor Hot Rod, you love Pastor Heart Rod, you love Pastor Heart! Quit it, please. You are worse than my husband and kids together. Oh, but not worse than Sara's kids. I'm just dying to know how that's going. I could just see those boys now chasing that pastor around with frogs and snakes. It's going just fine, thank you very much, my kids adore him. He is a man after god's own heart and mine. Men are only after one thing and it's not your heart. Where is my drink? Get your lazy behind up and help me. I'm not the maid and besides my behind is not as big as yours. It is too. What am I saying, yes it is? Honey, you're the one that has a big butt. You have been on that phone all morning. What is going on? Oh, I have to make a call. What is going on? We're remodeling the women's shelter and it's fundraising issues with the city non-stop. I don't know how you do it. Oh well, it's a joy. Hey, congratulations on your son. I hear he's gonna be serving our country. That is so brave of him. Have you been praying for his safety? I'm gonna make that call. I shouldn't have said anything about praying. I blew it. No, it's okay. She really did have to make the call. You didn't blow anything. Hey, what's up with her? Nothing happens in this town that I don't know about and I know all about it. Well, you better not be holding out on me. I'm the only one here who likes you. What are you talking about? Sara and Gracie love me. Ptth, they're Christians, they don't know any better, they love everybody. And Glen adores me. Glen adores the money that you give to the women's shelter. Well, what's wrong with that? I pride myself on having the kind of friends money can buy. Oh come on, don't go playing the fool. I may be a fool but I'm the only fool that read your last book. A book of poems. You didn't even bother to rhyme half of them. Where is that thing? You try reading my book with that fake sugary accent. Oh no, let go, let go. Let it go. I'll let it go, just let go of my hair. I'll let go of your hair, you put it down. Now you tell me about Glen. Well I was going to till you pulled my hair. Hey. Hey, Glen, come on in and you want to look at Patrice's new exciting book of poems? Oh great, now you're giving my party gift away. Oh it's alright, I've already read it. I keep up on all of you. These homes are so beautiful. I know. Where do people get so much money from? Maybe they all have rich ex-husbands like Coley. Speaking of which, you don't have to talk about it if you don't want. Have you heard from Scott? Once. I blame myself, you know. I keep thinking maybe if I'd been a better Christian. I mean at the beginning of our marriage, he would come to church with me and then it was like as my faith got stronger, he got more angry. He'd throw things around and accuse me of being a holy roller. He said when I wanted to home school the boys that was the last straw but then I found out he'd been having an affair the whole time. Ugh. Um... I'm so sorry. Maybe I wasn't good enough, you know, at anything? He'd stay awake all night on the computer and I'd be alone in the bed. I'm so lonely. I still pray for him, I'm trying not to be too bitter. It's hard seeing the boys grow up without a dad. What about Pastor Rodney? He would make a great dad. No preacher's gonna marry a divorced woman, come on. But still there's some times when I, I look into his eyes and I think he feels the same way I do but then nothing happens. Hello, what do you mean nothing happens? He's watching your boys for the weekend. I don't know, I think something good might happen. Oh Gracie, you're so cute but you're so naive. Patrice, I wanted to talk to you about doing a poetry reading at the woman's shelter fundraiser. It is the biggest event that keeps our doors open and your poetry, Patrice, it is powerful. You hear that, finally a voice of reason. And I guess it was real reasonable nearly yanking the hair right out my head. I always thought it was a weave. Okay, y'all are giving me a headache. I'm going upstairs, just talk amongst yourselves while I'm gone. Did I ever tell you my dad had a problem? I don't ever remember you talking about your dad. Your mama never seemed like the kind of woman who would be with a man like that. She always seemed like the perfect mother to me. We all loved her like she was ours, asking her for advice. Yeah, she's pretty amazing alright. She just got mixed up with the wrong guy. That's probably why she never remarried. But I never knew my dad, I just remember waiting for him, waiting and waiting and waiting on the doorstep. Years later, I would make up stories about him to my friends like he was a military hero, away in some exotic place. It must've been hard growing up without a dad. I always felt like there was something missing in me and I kept thinking if I find the right man, if I have perfect children, I kept thinking if I had the right house, had the right cars, that that missing feeling would just disappear but it never did. One day, I walked past this mirror, that pretty gold one in the hallway and I saw myself holding the baby and I looked like a dead soul. I couldn't see my physical self just that condition of my soul. And it was scary. That's when I called you and you brought me back. No, I am so glad you felt like you could call me but I'm not the one who brought you back and you know that. I know. I feel like if Coley and Patrice know about my new faith, they're gonna make fun of me. They already make fun of my husband. I know he works a lot, I know, and he's demanding but he is an amazing father. He's the kind of father that I always dreamed of having. And now, now you know the love of a heavenly father. He'll always come home. That's who you were waiting for on the steps when you were little. That's who you were missing. That's that hole that you felt like you could never fill. God has known you and loved you before time, Gracie. He whispered your name into your mother's ear and he called you Grace, amazing Grace. Thanks. Well this is something most people don't see every day. I remember trying some of these on back in college. Behind my back, all y'all did. Oh, Glen never did. Let me show you how it's done. Yes. This is gonna be fun. Now, when are you going to get those two adorable girls of yours started down the right path, Gracie? Do you know where self esteem comes from? From within. Don't be ridiculous, that's a bunch of bunkie, it comes from achieving things and there's no better way to teach confidence and poise to your girls than through pageants. I've seen some of those kid pageants on TV and they look like a train wreck. Okay and so do gymnastic events and track meets and football practice. Close. You just don't see the fathers out there pushing their sons to be number one or the mothers all upset behind the scenes. Life is a competition. I never understood the bond between you two. You're so different when she's not around. When I first came to the College of Charleston, I was lost. My home was far from there. And I walk into this door and there she is sitting there all loud and blonde and I stop in my tracks and she's thinking, you look like you just saw a ghost, honey, put your bags down and let's walk these halls and show these schools who's boss and I looked at her like she was crazy. But I put my bags down and off we went. That woman, she gave me a voice before I even thought I knew I had one. Well there is only one Coley. That's for sure. There's been some incidents, one or two, with Coley at numerous events. All you Charleston folk do is just do your little fundraisers and stab each other in the back. Now I never say a word about anyone ever. Yes, I know because you're old money mommy and daddy taught you better. I only say this from one Charleston heart to another. She doesn't go out anymore, she's become a recluse but she still sends a check, I guess as some form of apology. Listen, it gives them what old money, back stabbing, bony booty horse faces something to talk about, no offense to you, of course. Oh, no offense taken, my friend. Good. It's a wonderful thing for daughters and mothers to share. I would rather put my kids in a pageant than on some soccer field with some lunatic coaching and molding their little minds. Besides, not every child is cut out for academics or sports. Never thought of it that way. Well, think of it this way, if you had a champion thoroughbred, would you stick it out in a field with a bunch of donkeys? Uh no I wouldn't, if I had a thoroughbred, I wouldn't stick it in a field with a bunch of donkeys. Exactly, okay, well there you go. Maybe you need to call me more often. Don't get your head all twisted around with that Christian kool aid. I see you two talking. Now don't get me wrong, Sara is a wonderful girl, she's just got some crazy ideas about life. I mean I believe Jesus is the son of God and he came down from heaven and all that stuff but you don't have to go telling everybody about it. Look at you, you make a beautiful pageant queen, almost as beautiful as me. Now I'm warning you, I'm not gonna stop until you get those adorable girls of yours in the circuit. They'll win everything they enter. What if they lose? Then they'll feel awful. Well I wouldn't know, I never lost. Now, let's you and me go upstairs and be beauty queen winners. Oh no. Come on! I have to go take a shower and take a nap. I'm really tired. Oh Gracie, okay listen, don't be a runner up, you are a real winner, you are. That a girl Coley, again, I won't have it! Angie, don't you think this is a little harsh? She's just a child. She has to learn that second place is worthless. If you're not first place, you're nothing, period. And you know what I'm saying is true. She's just a child. Give her a chance to grow and follow her dreams. She has her dreams and she doesn't want to settle for second place. She wants to win, be first, everyone wants to win. Not when you're five years old. No one cares about those contests, they don't. They don't, I mean it's more for the parents anyways. The kids could care less. You don't even know what you're talking about. You're second place just like Coley. You'll never be a real winner 'cause you ain't got it in you. You're nothing, nothing! You ain't even a real daddy. Oh get that thing off your head please. Thank you. Coley will be mad. Well let Coley be the queen of crazy crowns, I don't care. I can hear you. Well look at you, miss everything. Where's your tiara? How Christian of you to ask. Is that any way for a wannabe preacher's wife to talk? Oh you know I'm speaking the truth. You have been the queen of everything. And I say it with love. Well I say this with love, this needs more red wine. Hey, have you talked to Pastor Hot Rod? Well just text messages. But it's good, we both decided that we should focus on the task at hand. He doesn't want me to worry. He doesn't want to get your hopes up, is what he's really saying. Coley, don't say that. I think it's like watching a romance novel come to life. Oh look, the president of South Carolina is here on official business. Where's your briefcase? Y'all look like y'all are off to a United Nations summit. Falling in love is just the most amazing thing. Are you and pastor gonna have a big wedding? What, no! Can I be in it. Oh of course, you'd be the waitress. Don't jinx it. Are you up for this? Oh, can't be any different than any other year. An obligation is an obligation. Nope, I mean the controversy. Did Coley tell you something? Nothing is going on, nothing. Coley knows nothing. She pretends to know but she doesn't know a thing but I do. I'm not doing anything wrong. He's an internet friend. He's an American professor working in China. Glen, you are playing with fire here. Let me tell you something one Charleston heart to another, you have spent your entire life empowering women, helping people, not just you but your family, and what, you're gonna blow it for some internet romance? You are better than this, Glen. Well yeah obviously I'm not. Well if you won't think of yourself, think of your family. Okay stop. You have no idea what it's like to be me. Do you have any idea how hard it is to keep up this house of cards? I have a mother who constantly criticizes everything I do and a husband who constantly cheats behind my back and a child leaving or the Air Force Academy and the whole family in an uproar because he decided not to go to West Point and telling me how I failed 'cause I did not teach him the importance of family tradition. I went to college, I graduated in three years, I spent four years in the Peace Corps, I came home, I married the man that I was supposed to and now I spend my days trying to make other people's lives better. I deserve this. I deserve this. I'm not doing anything wrong. He hears me and he writes me these words that every woman should hear at least once in her life. And now, I am watching my son do all the things I taught him and I do not want him to end up like this, you know, holding on to a phone for some small piece of happiness. Oh I'm so sorry, I am so sorry. No, no, I'm sorry. Oh I am sorry, I'm sorry. Well I guess if I was gonna have a lapse in better judgment it should be with you. It's funny because I always thought that your life was perfect, everything handed to you, that you could never relate to me or anything that I would be going through, trying to be a banker, the token one in the company, so you have to be better, you have to be smarter than most everyone that you ever work with, that you encounter, but my soul is that of an activist, of a poet, and I can't do what I want to do, I can't live the dream I want to live so I sacrifice family and I sacrifice the things I need because that's what we do. We are not that far apart. I think my life might be a little better than yours right now. Sorry. Dear Lord, thank you for the time that you've given us to be together this weekend. Thank you for all our blessings because we are so blessed. Please continue to watch over these precious women and keep our hearts open to you. Amen. Amen. Sure smells good. Mama's been in the kitchen. I tried to make that sauce so many times but I must be doing something wrong. The kids hate it. Coley, we've heard about your son, quite the football star, a linebacker, 230 pounds. How is your boy doing? You haven't mentioned him at all. Are we gonna sit around and talk a bunch of nonsense? Now we all know Robert has poisoned that child against me. Besides, whoever heard of eating Italian food without a glass of red wine? Let's get this party started. 500 bucks a bottle. - You know me. - I'm good. We have a long drive. Patrice, don't let me down. Maybe later. Hey, I have an idea, why don't we open our gifts before we eat? Every year it's the same thing. Let's do something different. - Great. - Okay, let's do it. What are y'all looking at me for? I'm not a party pooper or hangry. Coley, you always give the best gifts. Why don't you start? Show all of us bourgeoisie gift givers who's boss. For a second there, you sounded like the old Sara I used to know. Alright, everybody stay put, I'll be right back. Oh, good job. Alright, fellow Holy City Heartbreakers, may I present to you, fresh off the perfume assembly line of Gay Parade, not yet available in the United States, Sweet Carolina. - Oh! - Coley! You all have one in your bag. Thank you. Don't you love me? Yes. Top that. Coley, I can't top you, you know that. I think everybody here knows what my gift is, my latest book. And your writing is wonderful, thank you. And Patrice will be doing a reading at the women's shelter fundraiser and it will be held at the Charleston Yacht Club and I hope that all of you will attend. Patrice is truly an inspiring woman. Speaking of, if you will all fill out your cards, you'll receive a year's subscription to Sweet Southern Society magazine. Wait a minute, wait, wait, you mean you want us to fill out the cards for you? What are you so busy doing that you can't? I love that magazine. Thank you, Glen. Thank you, Glen. Thank you, Glen. You're welcome. Thank you, Glen. Well, I guess it's my turn. It's been my turn for awhile. I just haven't had the right words. Would you all please turn your picture frames over? Oh, alright. Oh my, somebody packed on a few pounds since last year. It's beautiful, Gracie. Y'all have been my family since college, my Charleston hearts, and I know that some of you have noticed a little bit of a change in me in the last year and no, I'm not pregnant, but there is someone new in my life, a new man, and his name is Jesus and he has made me a new person. I can't even find the words to describe all the things that he's done for me in my life. I was dead and now I'm alive. Sorry. Born again, freed of my sins, I still don't know all of god's missions for my life but maybe it's as simple as just sharing with all of you girls. But all I know is that God has made me a whole new person, a better person. I feel free. Gracie, as Jesus would tell you, well done, good and faithful servant. Thank you. I'm so proud of you. Oh! Well, it looks like God is speaking. Yes, I didn't now that God was a woman. I'd be signing up too. Don't worry, give it time, we're praying for you. Now I've always gone to church. I did when I was little. Okay, this isn't a revival. Sara, pass out those bibles now, the food's getting cold. Yeah, you know what I got you, let's eat. Rainy night in Charleston, rainy night in Charleston. Coley, baby, come on, let's go, I think it's time for you to go upstairs. Do you want me to help you? Just take this please. No, it's okay, it's okay, I got her. Why don't you guys go to bed? I'll just take her up. Come on, I got it, it's okay, Sara's going to bed, say goodnight to Sara now. Goodnight, Sara. Goodnight, Coley. Goodnight, everybody. We're going night night now. I love everybody. I'm on the road to recovery. Come in. Ah, there's the queen of mean. What are you talking about? Is that any way to talk to a dying woman? Dying woman, are you kidding me? You're hungover, that's all. Glen had to leave early, she left you a note. She does every year, ingrate. Glen loves you, we all love you, Coley. You have got to do something about your drinking. You know what, hold on a second, let me check my social calendar. Fundraiser at MUSC, fundraiser at the women's center, huh, look right here, it's an AA meeting two weeks from tonight. No seriously though, I have tried AA, couple of times. Anyway, let's talk about more important things. Honey, what could be more important than your health? Money, of course. Open it. And don't go telling the others. You know you've always been my favorite. I want you to take that money and I want you to publish yourself a new book. Honey, I don't self publish anymore, I have a publisher and an agent. You're too much. I know, thank you. No, but seriously, you really need to do something. Ah, please, we've had a nice weekend, okay? Okay fine but let's make a deal. You go to meetings, I'll follow up. If not, I'm dragging you to Betty Ford immediately. Oh no, anybody but her, please. I met Betty one time at this fundraiser... Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop. I know you. And I know you. Come give me a hug. Okay, drive safe, the weather man said there's storms. Love you. Okay, be safe, you know you're my favorite, don't tell the others. She told me to use mine to get the girls into pageants. Of course. You don't even want to know what she told me to use mine for but it's going straight to the church nursery. You need those for the boys. No, God will provide. I love you. I love you. Be safe. Be safe. I'll miss you. You too. I'll see you soon. Okay. A terrible thunderstorm this morning. We've had over 315 lightning strikes just in the last hour. And there was an accident on Highway 17 south of Charleston. The South Carolina highway patrol has confirmed that only a single car was involved and one fatality has been reported. Grace Williams of Newport, South Carolina. According to SCHP, the accident occurred at about 11:17 a.m. when her vehicle went off the road and crashed into the guard rail. Life is a competition. I just feel like putting so much importance on beauty isn't good. It's a wonderful thing for daughters and mothers to share. Again Coley! If you're not first place, you're nothing! Don't you want to go to your salon and do something with your? I'm not gonna tell him, I'm not gonna. Will you please go with me? I told you already, it's your friend. I assume you sent flowers on behalf of the entire family? Of course. Why don't you come with me? What an odd question. Why would I go? For me. I'm here for you every day. Oh Grady, it's been a long time. How you doing? I'm alright but she's not so good. I got you, I got you. Here's Glen. Glen. Oh, you look pretty. Thank you. Okay, come on, you and I are gonna do this. You just walk with me, just go with me, just go slow. Hey. Is it okay if we all keep calling you mama? Oh please. Look at you. Here, let me help you, I'll take her. It'd be an honor. Hey. Sweet, sweet girl. If anyone would like to come forward now and share a few words. The name of this poem is Graceful. Graceful as a summer's rain sliding down a window pane, graceful as a bright resting light who says I do every day of her life, graceful as a mother's applause while tiny ballerina bows, to little Lindsey, Jackie, Sydney, a mother's love never ends and heaven's grace will see you through. Rely on the strength she gave to you. When only the memory of her love remains, go on living each precious day gracefully. Hey everyone, I'm Craig, worship and music leader at Gracie's church. A few weeks ago we played a new song and she said that she really loved it so I thought that it would be a great thing to play today for her. I know she's listening. A day feels like forever until it's gone You're left with only memories Every moment's precious and we know The next one's never guaranteed I'm only passing through this place Very soon I will be on my way 'Cause this is not my home It's not where I belong Someday soon I'll be set free And the father calls me home I bow before the storm Worship for eternity I know that you'll be missing me Please be strong This is not my home This is not my home Hey Sara, I can take the baby now. Thank you. We'll see you back at the house, okay? Y'all sure you don't need family time alone? You girls are our family. Winston and I decided he and the girls will go to the burial site but we'll see you at the house, okay? See you there. It was a beautiful service, it was Grace. And your poem, Patrice, I loved it. It's that song, so beautiful. It's wonderful, isn't it? I keep humming it. I can't get over it, it's beautiful and the message, all about our eternal home. The message of god's love and salvation. It's starting to make sense to me for the first time. Really honey? Yeah. Isn't it beautiful when God starts to... Oh stop, please don't start again. That's all we've been hearing for the last half an hour. Coley, there's nothing wrong with talking about God at a time like this. That's all we've been hearing from you for the last 20 years, Sara. No, no, Coley. Excuse me. You've had enough, stop. What is the matter, what are you doing? Stop! You stupid. Do you think you're better than me because you do so much for the community, when the only good you do is for yourself? At least Sara lives for God. You, you live as if you are God. I am not listening to this. You, you're just drunk again. At least I don't live a double life. Listen, you are way out of line here, Coley. You're the biggest hypocrite of all, Patrice. Social injustice and the whole black thing, ha, you grew up in Marietta, Georgia. You might as well be 1,000 miles from Atlanta. I grew up closer to the hood than any of y'all. Coley, look at me, look at me, we love you, we love you. No you don't. We love you. No you don't, no you don't! No! You wish it'd been me instead of Gracie. - No! - Yes you do. No! Yes you do, all of you do. You wish it'd been me. Oh this is coming from some dark place inside of you, sweetie and it's not you. Please, look at me. Get off me. Stop. Get off me. Of course you wish you'd been me because deep inside, you know there isn't a God. So it may as well have been me. You can spray as much perfume on it as you want, it's not gonna change the fact that she's dead. And you all know it, she's dead. Coley. You stupid bible thumper. Go after her, somebody, go after her. I'm at a loss for words. Did you see Gracie's mother's face? As if she hasn't already been through enough already. Do you think we stayed long enough? I couldn't take it anymore. It's just more bad news on top of bad news. Yeah well, I'm never speaking to Coley again, I'm done. I barely speak to her as it is. She had a similar meltdown at the hospital fundraiser. Well Sara can deal with her now. I mean nothing short of a miracle is gonna help her turn her life around. All this talk about God and all this Christian thing, you know in some ways, I think Coley is right. Life is short. I'm sick of it. Sick of what, living? No. Thank you. Thanks. Okay. No, not living. I'm sick of living for everyone else. I am not gong to miss out on anymore of life because of everybody else's rules. So what are you gonna do, start living like her? No, like me, for me, for the way I see right and wrong. Well I don't know about right and wrong but that song is really pulling at my heart. I keep remembering how happy and alive Gracie was at our last dinner and it made me think, what do I have? No kids, no nothing, just, just my words written onto books and it makes me think I don't know but there has to be something more. Don't cry. Look, you save all those words for when you're not hurting. You do the same. Girls, what are y'all doing here? We want our grandma. She's right here, sweetie. Why don't we all sit down and talk? "Eyes into the hills" "who once come with my help. "My help cometh from the Lord "who made heaven and Earth. "He will not let thy foot slip "and he will not slumber, "he who watches over thee. "Behold, he will not slumber nor sleep, "he watches over Israel." Is he in? Uh huh. Oh good. Deacon Ray, hey, it's Daisy at the church. You want to give me a call when you get a chance? There's some things going on around here I think you should know about. Everyone went to that playground, his family is is in need now and it's gonna benefit everyone so... Is now a bad time? No, come on in, come on in. Hey Ron, let me call you right back, alright? Yeah, look, thanks. Hey, how are you? Good. I mean God is good. Yes and that cake is good it looks like. Here, here. That looks beautiful, thank you so much. Thank you for taking care of the boys. I have never seen them so well behaved in all my life. I don't know what you did to them. Well you know what they say, spare the rod, spoil the child. Come on, sit down, sit down. You alright, everything alright? Oh I wouldn't even be able to know how to answer that question. I have so much going on. Hey, what do you say we get a bite? We can talk about the boys and how my weekend went with them? Yeah, sure, let's do it, let's go. No, I don't mean now. I mean you know tomorrow, an official bite, maybe tomorrow around noon if that's okay with you. I'll pick you up. You mean like a date? Oh, you mean like an official bite? Yeah. Yeah, we could do that, yeah. I'd love that. Yeah because you have been a great pastor and so we could go get a bite, go for a bite. You know Sara, I hope that I've been a good friend to you. You can call me Rod or Rodney, if you like, you know, whichever one you like better. I like them both very much, the names. Okay, yeah, a bite, tomorrow, tomorrow. Tomorrow, noon, I'll pick you up. Thanks for the cake. I'll see you tomorrow. Tomorrow? You coming back here tomorrow? Well isn't that nice? Bless your heart. Oh, look at you, you look pretty. I want a hamburger. I couldn't find a babysitter. That's okay. Yeah. Yeah. You know what, let's forget about that restaurant, I think I got a better idea. Okay. Yeah. Now watch this. After all, I've been on you about that for awhile. I hope you can get it done by noon today... Okay, Larry, Larry, give me a minute okay? Thanks. Hey, what's going on? He's here, in Charleston. Who's here? My internet friend, Mark. He's here on business for two weeks. Oh yeah, monkey business. I'm serious. He's got an important job. The man is fluent in Arabic and Chinese. He's working with the Air Force, it's all top secret. Okay, is hanky panky the same in Chinese as it is in English? Have you seen him yet? Not yet. I was thinking about the fundraiser next week, maybe you could bring him as your guest. No, no, there's no way I'm going to walk into a poetry reading about social justice with a white guy hanging on my arm. I'm sorry, no. He wouldn't be hanging on your arm. He'd be your escort. Glen, I don't know about this. Please say you will. Patrice, you're my only friend. Don't back out on me. You know how hard my life is. There's something, I don't know, there's something wrong about this. What's so wrong? I just want to meet him. Men and women can't be friends or talk? You're not friends, you don't even know him, he's just a bunch of words on a computer screen. People read your poetry and feel like they know you without every meeting you. How's this any different? I don't know. Ever since Grace died, I've been rethinking my whole life. I keep picturing how Gracie was the last time we saw her at our last dinner together. I don't know, I don't know what's right anymore, I don't know what the truth is. What is right? What do you mean right? And the truth, it's what you make it. Listen to me, Patrice, the bible, it's just a book about white people trying to feel good about themselves. It's a lot of self righteousness. No, I don't know about that, see, I just, it's about the oppressed race and god's power, that's what I feel it's about. It's much like my own poetry, only God is the great equalizer. It's not about color or race, it's about forgiveness. I'm seeing whole different book here now. You've been talking to Sara. No mam, I have not but I might. I just want to get my life right. Patrice, your life is fine the way it is. You are a good person. You remember that. I just don't know anymore. I think the boys enjoyed that more than the restaurant, don't you think? Oh, I know they did. Do you feel like desert? No, you? No, I'm good, I'm good with this. Can I ask you kind of a personal question? Sure. What made you become a pastor? Well, I came to the Lord at eight years old. Eight? Yep. Well then there's hope for my boys yet. Yes, your boys remind me a lot of my brother and I. We're around the same number of years apart. So what happened when you were eight? Well, a couple of friends of mine and I went into a local five and dime store and saw some candy, didn't have any change, grabbed a handful and ran out of that place and went down the street, I was scared to death, I thought somebody was gonna jump out and grab my shoulder and off to jail I'd go. I bet. Don't tell that to my boys. I don't want them getting any ideas. That is unless of course you did go to jail. No, I went to church on Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday because my father was a true blue bible believer and he was gonna make sure that we got the message. You and I grew up in the same family. Yeah well, only I never really got the message. I could never figure out why we went to church so much, why we had to go but that night was different. I remember sitting in my seat in church and I had tears rolling down my cheeks and that candy was in my pocket felt like it weighed 100 pounds and then the minister said, "Anyone out there who'd like to ask for forgiveness "and live a life with Jesus Christ, please come forward." And I couldn't get out of my seat quick enough. I ran forward and I kneeled and when I came face to face with him, my hands were shaking, and I handed over the candy. You poor thing. And he looked at me, he just wiped the tears off my cheeks and he gave me a big hug and he lifted me in the air and I tell you at that moment, I felt pure forgiveness, pure, pure love, and I guess that's why they call it the good news. Ever since that day, I just wanted to spread the word to anybody who'd listen and I took my bible anywhere I went. You gave me chills. Impressions, when you're young, boy. I wish it was that clear for me. I mean I don't know what God has planned for my life, what he wants me to do, what my path is. Lately, I think he wants me to reach out to Coley and Patrice and Glen and bring them closer to God. But I don't know how. I've tried, I send them emails and literature and all that but you know. Yeah, well sorry, emails and literature are something that can really turn people off, you know, it's just not personal enough. Yeah. I got a better idea. Why don't you go visit? Why not? It's the perfect time, their hearts are open, I'll watch your boys for you. You will not. I will, I would love to watch 'em. We have such a great time. You are so amazing with them, Pastor Rod. I thought you could call me Rod or Rodney and cut out the amazing part, too. I mean, nah, maybe leave that in. Okay, alright, well Rod or Rodney, can I ask you, you're so great with kids, have you ever been married? I really have been married to the holy word and the church I just haven't married a woman yet. Well, maybe one day you'll marry me. Hey mom. Yeah? I'm thirsty. Let me take care of that. Maybe one day I will. Well maybe you'll marry me one day. I was just thinking we should take a trip to Hotlanta and here you are. This is amazing. You've been on my heart and mind for the last two weeks, Patrice. There are so many times I've been meaning to call you but I haven't had the courage. I haven't felt that good about myself. You, who is so bold in everything you do, not good about yourself? Sometimes that boldness covers up other things, believe me. I don't think I ever told you about this but when I was younger I met this man, he was so handsome, Harvard Business School grad and white, and I fell head over heels in love with him and it took a lot of courage for me to bring him around my family. You know how proud they are about our black heritage. He kept telling me it doesn't matter if a person's black or white, what really matters is true love, only his love wasn't so true because a few days after he took me to meet his family, I never heard from him again. He got some job up in New York and lost my number. I was devastated and lost and it changed the way I felt about other people but mainly it changed the way how I felt about myself. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry it took Gracie's death for me to really get to the truth. That's when I started reading the bible, the bible that you gave me, and for the first time, I felt love, real love. Yeah and peace, especially at a time like this. Yeah. God has his reasons for doing things that we don't always understand like losing Gracie. One day when we meet in heaven, we'll understand his reasons and it will all make sense and we'll see all the times when he was watching over us and protecting us and loving us. I believe that, I really do. Okay, so what's next? I don't know how this works. Well keep reading your bible and find a church, I'll help you. Actually, our church every month has a ceremony, a baptism ceremony for new believers and it's this Sunday. You could come if you want to and be baptized by Pastor Rodney. Ooh, well yes then, I'd love to. Somebody pinch me, I must be dreaming. Thank you. I'm so glad I came. Me too. Oh hey, she's waiting for you upstairs. Grady, how about a hello and a hug? You girls drive me crazy. Come in. Oh, it's just you. Well, who were you expecting? Well, Blake Shelton of course but he appears to be running a little late. Get out of this bed. I am sick and running a fever. You are not sick. Did you have something you wanted to say to me? I thought I said it with the check. I'm sorry though. Well that's better, not much. I am trying to change my evil ways. I even went to a couple AA meetings. Yeah, you get anything out of 'em? Yeah, they gave me a chip, it says one day at a time. It just doesn't seem to be working very well. Well how 'bout I take you to church instead? Oh no, I'm already gong through menopause. That would really bring on the hot flashes, no. Coley, I'm serious. I've never seen you like this before. You can't go on like this. You've hurt a lot of people. Yeah, I suppose I have. But what else is new, right? It seems to be my area of expertise, just like I hurt my son. It's not too late. Coley, all things are possible with God. This straight out of his word. All things including mending your broken past, your relationship with Bobby, all of it. I miss Bobby. I miss him so much. But I can't face it without boos. I can't do anything without it and I've tried. It's impossible. All things are possible with God. Maybe for some. Please let me help you. You know what, I've got a bad headache right now but thank you for coming by, really, I appreciate it. Don't go breaking my heart right now, I need you. I need you too and I won't let you down, I'll call, really I will. Now you go on and get out of here now. Miss Dorothy Rutledge? Who's asking? FBI, mam. We have reason to believe that your daughter may be seeing a man named Mark Johnson. I thought you should know that he's under federal investigation and that anybody involved with him could be subject to the same type of trouble. Trouble? Danger mam, a con artist of the worst kind. Hey there, Fred. Look at you. Why don't you have a seat right down next to me? - That's alright, I'm just waiting on my good friend, vodka. Straight up? You know I've never liked ice. It's too cold. Make that two. I could do it. You had some visitors today. I did, who? Two gentlemen from the FBI. What are you talking about? Well, they told me that my daughter was dumb enough to have an internet affair with a professional con artist. You were one of 26, four of them live right here in Charleston, all waiting to meet him. How special. If he thought he wasn't gonna get a big enough check from 'em, he would pickpocket their purses while they were dining out and by the time they realized, there would be $25,000 in hotel and restaurant charges on their credit cards. Where did you think that the two of you would go for dinner tonight on your dollar and no one in this town would recognize you? Of course, you didn't think about that because your family name means absolutely nothing to you. Mother, that's not true. How long do you think it's gonna be before everybody in this town knows about this? Maybe if you'd be a better wife to the husband that you have living here, the two of you wouldn't go tramping around town leaving your dirty laundry in everybody else's backyard. Mother, stop it, just stop it, just once, just once I wish, I wish that you would shut up. Where are you going? None of your business. Are you with the blonde lady? - Yes, I am. - You need to come in, I need some help. Just feel free to say what's on your mind, that's what we're here for. It's just really hard to understand. I have spent my whole life trying to be good. I've never deliberately sinned or tried to hurt anyone else. And still I am sitting here and I am watching my whole life fall apart and every good thing that I have ever done has led me nowhere. And then when I finally decided that I was sick of being good, I still get walked all over. Glen, only you and God know the truth. You don't have to answer to me or anybody else but let me just ask you one question, have you ever told a lie? Of course. Have you ever used the lord's name in vain? Everyone has. Do you know that the bible says that if you look at another person in lust that you are guilty in your heart of adultery? But everyone does those things? That is exactly right and that is why Jesus sacrificed his life for us so that we wouldn't have to spend an eternity separated from God. He took on our sin. But what is sin? And I don't like the idea of a God who sends people to hell. Sin is when you go directly against god's holy word, against his holy commandments. So you're saying that God is the only truly good thing and we can never be good enough but he's given us a way out despite all of our sinning so what? Being good is a waste of time? No, no, no, being good is good, being good works for society, it's great but what we're really talking about here is faith in Jesus Christ. I'm really tired of trying to figure it out on my own. I'm exhausted. But I know that there has to be a better way I just don't know whether this is it and I just don't know if Jesus Christ is the only way. Glen, nobody walks through those church doors by mistake, nobody. Lord is calling out for you, right now reaching out for you. I'll think about it, I'll think about it and I'll maybe do some reading. Don't just think about it, pray about it. Listen to your heart. It'll tell you. Read the bible I gave you. You know Patrice is getting baptized here Sunday. I knew she'd been talking to you. Wait, I was baptized when I was a child. Mmhmm, yeah, me too, that was our parents commitment to raise us in the faith but as adults, it's our choice so baptism is publicly proclaiming your faith in Jesus as our savior. And all you need to do that is the faith part. Help me with my lack of faith. - Okay. - Good gracious girl. Glen, could we pray with you right now? Alright, let's pray with Glen. Dear holy father, thank you for bringing Glen here today. Pray that you'll guide her like you guided her into this church, you'll guide her on her way to a life in your faith. Praise in Jesus's name, amen. Drugs, alcohol, possible overdose. Take good care of her. What do you think? Do you think we got through to her a little bit? Thank you assistant pastor. Thank you assistant friend. Oh, I should take this. It might be Daisy, she's got the boys. Hello? What? No. Okay, I'll be right there. What happened? It's Coley. She's in the hospital. She took an overdose of pills and they're trying to revive her. I can't do this again. I can't do this again. Listen, I'm going to drive you and everything's gonna be alright. Okay, I promise you, everything's gonna be alright. Let's go, come on, let's go. Are you family? Yes. Well, she's a very lucky lady. Her blood alcohol alone was close to killing her and she had 30 pills in her stomach. I'm not so sure this wasn't a suicide attempt. No, no, I know here, she wouldn't do that. She just got confused and she didn't know how many she took. Well, my advice to her is to stay here and get some medical attention, mostly psychological at this point. She's going to need help, serious help. May we go in to see her now? Two at a time, no longer than five minutes, she needs rest. Well you two go first. Okay. Okay. I hear you're going to be baptized this weekend. Yeah, I am. Me too. That looks like it. Coley. Hey Sara. Oh thank We've been praying for you all night. Everybody's here but Pastor Rodney and Patrice, even Glen. I'm real sorry, I didn't mean to give everybody a fright. We're just glad you're here. Sara, would you step out in the hall? I'd like to talk to Pastor Rodney alone. Okay. I love you. How are you doing? I'm here. Yeah, you sure are. You sure have a lot of friends out there who care about you. You don't know me from anybody. Well, I do know something about you. I know you just asked me to stay here because there's something in your heart that's looking for a deeper meaning. I may not know you personally but Jesus knows every hair on your head. Yeah, me too. Yeah, I'll bet you do. Pastor, you probably never met anybody quite like me before, right? Well, matter of fact I do know someone who drank an awful lot, yep, she was pretty like you too and had three kids, had great husband, nice place in the suburbs, she wasn't happy 'cause all she wanted to do was drink. And one day she just vanished, left those kids behind, family behind, met some fella who made a lot of promises to her and had some money, she partied and partied and partied till the parties got smaller and smaller till there was no one left and Carol was her name and Carol ended up in a cheap seven dollar a night motel room drinking all alone and her kids wanted to see her but she just refused to see them. And she ended up passing away alone. Well that's not me. No, that's my mom. I don't want that to be me. It's not gonna be you. Help me, pastor. Please help me, I don't want to do this anymore. It's okay, you're not alone, you're not gonna do this alone, okay? You got friends here, you got me here any time you want to talk to me. Okay. Okay? I brought you a little present, okay, this is gonna help you more than me. You don't have to read the whole thing but just open it from time to time when you feel like you need to talk to somebody that might give you comfort. I will. Okay. Okay. Thank you pastor. Okay. Okay. Alright, I'll send in your friends. Okay. Okay. Hey boys. Did y'all mind your manners for Miss Daisy? Yes, mam. Okay, good. Go inside, I'll get your breakfast in a minute. Daisy, I'm so sorry, it was a crazy night and we all wound up spending it at the hospital. No Sara, I'm the one who has to say I'm sorry. When Pastor Rodney first showed up 10 years ago, I thought hallelujah, this is an answer to prayer, not the kind of prayer that you're thinking. When I saw the two of you alone together at the church, I knew in my heart that God hadn't heard my prayer. Then you walked in the church offices that day with a beautiful cake and smile on your face and jealousy just filled my heart and I picked up the phone and I called Deacon Ray. You know what a busy body he is. Daisy. Just everything took on a life of its own and now they're a lot of people in an uproar wondering what a divorced woman with two kids is doing hanging out with a single pastor. I've been up all night reading my bible. I asked God to forgive me. Now I'm asking you to forgive me too. Daisy, why did you do that? I was jealous. Please, please forgive me. Of course I forgive you. Of course I forgive you. Hey Sara, Sara, hey I wanted to talk to you after the service. Oh I heard, I already know. You heard what? Well I can read the writing on the wall. I gotta go, the service is starting. What is she talking about? Church family, this has been a day of celebration, amen. And we're going to continue that celebration by baptizing the new souls that have committed themselves to a life with Christ. You ready? Coley Phillips, in the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit, I baptize you. When he rises, you have risen Embrace this life you've given The old has gone The new has come The new has come The new has come The new has come The old has gone The new has come The new has come The new has come And the old has gone The new has come And the old has gone The new has come Will you marry me? What? Are you serious? Yeah, I'm serious. Yes. Yes, yes? Yes. We rise as you have risen Embrace this life you've given The old has gone And the new has come The new has come The new has come The new has come And the old has gone The new has come The new has come A day feels like forever till it's gone And you're left with only memories Every moment's precious And we know the next one's never guaranteed We're only passing through this place And very soon I will be on my way 'Cause this is not my home It's not where I belong One day soon I'll be set free When the father calls me home I'll bow before a stone And worship for eternity I know that you'll be missing me But please be strong 'Cause this is not my home Oh no When the tears are falling Rest alone I will never cry again When you feel you can't keep going 'Cause your heart is broken Remember this is not the end 'Cause life is full of pain of sin And forever's where we'll meet again
