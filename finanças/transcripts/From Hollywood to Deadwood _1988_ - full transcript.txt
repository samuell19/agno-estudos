Hello, this is Jack Haines, private investigator. If your wife is cheating on you, please give her my name and number. Thank you. Haines, pick up the phone. Haines, I know you're there. All right, 20 bucks says you can't beat me to the bar. George, beer. -What's the rush, Haines, thirsty? -Yeah. Haven't seen Raymond, I hope. How'd you get here so fast? Never left. Raymond, one of these days I'm gonna blow you away. You son of a bitch. I almost killed myself. Four and a half minutes, Haines. That's gotta be a record. Send it in to the Guinness Book. Just giving you some tail work. Didn't want you to get out of practice. Well, that ain't the kind of tail work I need. George, get me a beer and whatever Haines is drinking is on me. It was stupid. Drive all the way out there to see my ex-wife. Try to borrow money from her. Pathetic. My life is pathetic, Raymond. Someone's gonna call. They always do. Who? The last case was a goddamn embarrassment. You hear about that, George? Some guy wants to pay us 200 a day plus expenses to follow his dog at night and see where it goes. I mean come on, Raymond. Following a dog at night. Taking pictures of him relieving himself. You don't need that. Takes time to establish yourself. You know that. I don't know, Raymond. I don't know. Well, hi there. Hi. Seen any good movies lately? I don't go to movies. Oh, where do you go? Places I like. Maybe the places you like are the places I like. Maybe. You two know each other? We just met. Well, I'm with her. Oh, you two know each other? Very well. Well, thanks for telling me. I just got over a nasty bout of the clap. You care to repeat that, pal? Oh, what's the matter? So thick between the ears they don't work? I hope you can afford a good plastic surgeon. Back off, meat head. What's the matter? Your friend can't handle himself? He can handle himself. He just can't afford a good plastic surgeon. Haines, you can't lose control like that. I'm telling you, you're gonna get us in trouble. I can handle myself. What about you carrying your piece in that bar? Aren't you fortunate I was? I don't know, Raymond. I think I'm gonna give up this detective work. -Go back to acting. -Do it and quit talking about it. I will. Just as soon as I have some money. When are you going to finish that mystery novel? About a year. A year? What do you do, write one word a day? If that. Now, I'm backing on my 10% of that novel. Seeing how it's based on my exploits. Oh, don't flatter yourself. Look, if it makes a killing, I'll make sure you never go hungry. Or thirsty. In the meantime... Thank God, I needed that. Yeah, I love it. Maybe we should have stayed in LA instead of coming down here. Nah, we were burning out up there. Well, we were having fun. No, we weren't. We were miserable. We got stiffed on half our bills. I think Hollywood has got to be the sleaziest place in the world. Yeah, but in all that sleaze and slime, there's work for us. Down here, nobody is doing anything that requires our services. Bullshit, it's just more subtle. That's all. We're gonna get a lot of interesting cases down here. I'm telling you. My name is Steve Reese. I need to talk to you about a highly confidential matter. 213-464-7626. Call me anytime, day or night. Thank you. Yeah, what's up? We got a job. What is it, a stakeout at the wild animal park? No, Haines. It's a film company. Missing person. They don't want to talk about it over the phone. Hollywood? Yes, Hollywood. I thought we weren't gonna take anymore entertainment cases. There's reward money in this one, Haines. I gotta warn you. I got a mean headache here. Take an aspirin. We're leaving in about an hour. What the hell is that? It's a shiatsu mask. A what? It's got ice water in it. Soothes the temples. Does it work? Of course it does. What do you think I'm wearing it for, disguise? Haines. Mr. Reese, a Raymond Savage is here to see you. All right. It's the last office on the left. You can go right in. Um, haven't I seen you in films before? No, I don't think so. Haines. Raymond Savage. Jack Haines. We're very pleased to meet you, gentlemen. This is Marcia Diamond, associate producer and vice president of production. How do you do? Ted Field, president of Monolith. And I'm Stephan Reese. You may call me Steve. I'm the producer of the film. Steve got your name from Bob Elmendorf over at Castle. He said you were brilliant in a video pirating case, that you knew the entertainment business inside and out. Recognize her? Lana Dark. She did some films in the late '70s. She was up for an Academy Award. Didn't win. She took off for Europe and that's all I know about her. Very good. Lana is in a picture I'm producing for Monolith called Pleasure. Monday, she didn't show up for her call. No one knows where the fuck she is. Where was she living? Shangri-La Hotel in Santa Monica. She checked out Friday. She has a house in Santa Fe, New Mexico, but she hasn't been there for months. In fact, it's up for sale. Did you call the police? Of course, we did. They checked into it, but because she is not missing as a result of foul play they won't look for her. In other words, it's our problem. Not theirs. How can you be sure it isn't foul play? That's how. What have you done to find her? We have talked to everybody, tried to find out where she might have gone but no one knows anything. We have 10 million leveraged against distribution deals all over the world. If we don't finish this picture, we're in trouble. You're insured. Of course, we're insured, but nobody wins in these insurance cases. It's not particularly good for a production company's reputation to have the actress walk off the set. Maybe there were tensions on the set. Who knows? It doesn't matter. You have to be a professional in this business. First time director, they had some problems. Lana is very demanding. She can be difficult. But we want her back. It wasn't anything specific, was it? Boyfriend problems, not getting paid. Nobody gives a shit about her personal problems. All right. Who saw her last? - Her driver. - When was that? Friday afternoon, when he took her back to the hotel. Did she have a car? She had a rental. Nobody knows where she rented it from. We're offering a $25,000 reward. We want you to work double overtime. All right. We'll look for her. Beside a reward on something like this, we go for five a day for both of us plus expenses. And we'll need a five-day retainer in advance. Fair enough, gentlemen. We're gonna need the names and numbers of cast and crew, anyone else we should know about. Family... All we have is right here. All right. What do you want us to do when we find her? Don't contact her, call us. We'll take it from there. Okay, I think that's everything. Oh, there's one more thing. I'd like a contract for the reward money signed and notarized before we get started. Is that necessary? We found that it is when dealing with clients in the film business. I knew you guys would be back. What happened? No work down there? Sit down. Sit down. Okay. We got a case up here. 25 grand reward. Who's missing? Actress, she shut down a big film production. Psycho, huh? Maybe. Aw, hell. You'll probably find her drying out in Palm Springs. Or up in Malibu talking to the waves. I miss you guys. You're too good for that podunk beach town. Oh, we're too good for detective work period. Yeah, we all are. Ernie, we need a file pulled from immigration. The actress goes by a fictitious name. Lana Dark. Sexy. We want to find out her real name. She spent a couple years over in Europe, so they should have a pretty good file on her. That's no problem. I'll get old Deeker back in uniform. Haven't used him in a while. But I think he's still living. Have to grease his palm though. Two for Deek. Two for you. Ah, hell. I don't want any. You guys are friends. Come on, Ernie. Take it. -Quid pro quo. -Quid pro quo, what's that? Chinese seafood dish. Raymond, you still big on the words, huh? He intellectualizes everything. Drives me nuts. I got to ride around on Haines' shoulders so he doesn't look decapitated. You two. You ought to get a divorce. You got any advice on disappearance? Yeah, you find out everything you can. Personal habits, anything. You never know what will flush her out. The police have already been here. Well, the police don't have college educations. Has anyone else stayed in this room since she left? No. Maid find anything? Just that book over there. Well, the long-distance are to a Santa Fe, New Mexico number. A realty office, probably the brokers to her house. Let's see. A couple calls to the production company. This girl didn't socialize much if you ask me. Well, what do you think, fly or drive? If you know where you're going, you fly. If it's a cracked brain pan, you drive. How's she run? Who are you? Private investigators. You're Lana Dark's driver, right? What's the matter, something wrong? Did you drive her from the set to the Shangri-La Hotel on Friday night? Yeah, that's right. You didn't wait for her and take her somewhere else? The airport, maybe? No, why? Is she missing? Missing. Did we say anything about missing, Raymond? I don't remember saying that. They said they were gonna shut down for a few days. I figured something was wrong. Listen, Bobby, what kind of a woman is she? What she a jerk to you? Did she talk to you? Was she on time when you picked her up? I loved driving her. I looked forward to it. She always asked me how I was doing, how I was getting along. She'd always thank me. She's a wonderful person. I hope nothing has happened to her. She didn't seem disturbed to you at all, did she? Lana? Disturbed? No. You think of anything, give us a call. Next day, my agent calls all excited and says I got the part. Well, I'm going nuts. Lead role in a major motion picture. I'm on a dead-ahead course with fame and fortune. Then my agent calls again. And he says they've decided to go with someone else. You know who that someone else was? Bob Redford. Bob "Golden Boy" Redford waltzes in at the eleventh hour and aces me out. That's when I started drinking. How about you? What can I get for you? Uh, nothing. Thanks. Contract is signed. Good. Haines, you were an actor once. Why would somebody walk? Once? I still am. Right, sorry. How would you like it if I introduced you as an ex-writer of mysteries that never got published? Okay, got the point. I don't know. A lot of reasons. But disappear? Career suicide. That's why I can't figure it. Something pretty heavy must've happened. Or she flipped her pons. That girl look crazy to you? You never know till you buy 'em a drink. I just don't believe it. You don't believe it, or you don't want to believe it? How'd you know all that stuff about her, anyway? I saw a film she made a few years ago. It's one of my favorites. What's that? Blue Stranger. Never heard of it. What, did you get a crush on her? Haines, I don't get crushes on movie stars. Let's get out of here. Ernie, it's Savage. What's up, buddy? All right. We appreciate it. We'll buy dinner for you when this is all over. Right, quid pro quo. Yeah, thanks. Well? Laura Durkheim. I'm looking for a woman who might have rented a car here sometime during the last six weeks. She might be listed as either Laura Durkheim or Lana Dark. I'd like to see some back invoices or if I could get on your computer. Whichever is easier for you. I don't think I can do that without approval. Come on. You're a modern woman, aren't you? I could get fired. Look, let me just call the main office and see if they'll approve this. Wait. Wait a minute, all right? Uh, I'm not really a private investigator. I had this made up. The woman I'm looking for is my wife. We had a fight and she left. Now, I know that she rented a car here. I know that. And I just want to know if she's brought it back or not. I'll tell you, I've been miserable. Really miserable. I'm sorry. Can I get you some water? No, thanks, just the invoices. I'm sorry, I... It still hurts. These go back the last three weeks. Thank you very much. Thank you. What about La Cabana? I can't eat that shit. Let's get some sushi. All right, follow me. Whatever car rental place it is, it's not close to the Shangri-La, that's for sure. I called Social Security and got an old address for her in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Her father died in 1968 and her mother was placed in a hospital for alcoholism the same year. Lana was put in the custody of her aunt. I talked to her. She thinks Lana is possessed by the devil. Hasn't even talked to her since she left for Hollywood at 17. No brothers or sisters? Nada. Barry, it's Raymond Savage. How's the film business? Barry, the reason I called is I want you to arrange the screening of a film for me. It's called Blue Stranger. It's a film noir period piece shot around 1980, directed by a guy named Robert Martins. It stars Lana Dark. Who is it? Nick Detroit, private investigator. Open the door or there won't be one anymore. What do you want, tough guy? Your husband hired me to find you. So you found me. Now what? Listen to me and listen to me good. I've been on this case for two weeks. I've been lied to, beat up and worse. When I saw your car out in front, my job was over. The moment I knocked on the door, I crossed over the line. Something a good detective shouldn't do if he wants to keep his license. I'm not impressed. Your husband's a killer. Men kill over little things like money and beautiful women disappearing in the middle of the night. Am I making sense? Or do I sound as stupid as I feel? What do you want from me? The truth. The truth? The truth is I could shoot you right now and put this gun in your hand and they'd think you just got tired of your miserable life. Wouldn't it be heaven? Police, open up! Give me the gun. No. I said open it! A married couple who are having a little spat over money. If you don't want to spend the next 20 years of your life in the state pen, keep your pretty mouth shut and do what I tell you. Okay. You'll get out of here. Raymond, turn out the light. What are you reading, anyway? Nothing. I'm just filling in the profile. Oh, the profile. Well, Raymond, I got news for you. Tomorrow, I'll get her credit card and your profile is history. Hey, what the hell are you doing? -Remember me? -Yeah, what do you want? I have a problem. Lana had a rental, but not a company rental. I've been to every rental agency around the motel and I've come up with nothing. Nothing! You didn't take her to a rental car place when she first checked in, did you? Shit. Here comes my client. Beverly Hills Hotel. Hold on, fat cat. I got a few questions to ask your driver and then I'll be on my merry way. Come on, man. Split. Give me a break. Who is this eight ball? He's a private investigator. Yeah, looks like a bum to me. Look, jerk, don't irritate me. Sit back, have a drink, take your clothes off. Do whatever you do back there. This will only take a minute. I have to take this crap? This is my limo. And don't call me an eight ball again or I'll dust your kisser. And then I'll kiss her duster. Are you going to let him talk to me like that? You've been lying to me, Bobby. You see that little bead of sweat on you lip. Get your hands off me. She's in trouble, Bobby. Real trouble. She's flipped. Now, we want to find her and help her. You understand? I don't care how much she paid you to keep your mouth shut. You're gonna tell me or I'll eat 'em. I'll lose my job. Just tell me the name of the agency. I followed her to a Budget on Jefferson. She turned in her car and then I took her to another Budget out by the airport. She told me she was leaving. She didn't want anyone to know. Honest to God, I don't know where she went. How much she pay you to keep your mouth shut? $200. And you couldn't do it, could you? You're sick, man. Care for a drink? No, thank you. That picture was taken at the Venice Film Festival, some years ago. You were in love with her? Yes. At the time. Is this the first picture you've made together since Blue Stranger? It's been a long time. Why do you think she walked? It was her first film in five years. Lana wanted it to be something more than it was intended to be. She's a very bright girl. Most directors don't like strong-willed women. So they clashed. Can I get a smoke from you? Something isn't right here? An actress who has been in a lot of films, comes back to Hollywood to revive her career and the first film she gets, and this is with an old friend no less, she leaves halfway through production for no reason. That doesn't make sense. There is something else you should know that Monolith doesn't know. She did this once before on a film in Europe. It took them a week to find her. But she came back. Lana is a very capricious woman. She has dark mood swings where all of a sudden she becomes so morose, you can't get through to her. And then she can be wonderful. Where did the financing for Pleasurecome from? It was pre-sold to buyers and distributors all over the world. What happens if it isn't finished? Even with the insurance, we stand to lose a lot of money. Not to mention credibility in the business. I've got to finish this picture. I'll let you know when I have something. Bullshit, you're no private investigator. Man, I'm having a real credibility problem here today. Maybe I need a new tailor. Like I said. Bull. Shit. Well, I guess I'm just a big old bullshitter, then. Now, let me see those receipts! Okay, okay. Pick up my hat! Have a little respect for your elders. Punk. What's up? Had to use the knuckle duster, but I got it. Haines, when I'm just about ready to write you off, you come through. Write me off and you are through. Now check this, she turned in one car and picked up another. What does that tell you? She drove. Like I predicted, cracked brain pan. And if she's using that credit card, she's gonna keep on using it. Pretty tough to get information out of those people though. Well, what do we need? I forget. Credit card number, we got that. Social Security number, ditto. And her credit limit I think. We can guess that. Yeah, we need one other thing. A woman's voice. Come on, let's go see that old girlfriend of yours. I told you I don't want to see Christine. Pull over. Excuse me, miss. How would you like to make a quick 50 bucks? Jesus! I just wanted you to make a phone call. Pervert! That's a hell of an opening line, Haines. We must be too close to Hollywood Boulevard. -Let's go see Christine. -No! You son of a bitch. You still owe me $200. And wouldn't take my phone calls. Where the hell you been? -I don't want to see you. -Wait a minute, Christine. I was going to pay you but I just didn't have the money. And I was going to call you, but it's long distance now. Uh-huh. I can't believe you come here like this, showing your face asking me for a favor. Christine, here's the 200 we owe you. I ought to give you this for clothes. You look like what we haul in on the weekends. Yeah, and you're a sweet as... Pardon me, but could you two pursue this some other time? Christine, we'd like for you to make a phone call on a credit card. This better be legal. Yeah, it's... It's pretty much legal. She's heading east by car. I see. She stayed in a Holiday Inn in Barstow and she bought gas in Gallup, New Mexico. Well, it sounds like a rash decision to me. She's driving, so it could mean there's no real purpose to where she's going. She might be just blowing off steam. Well, the shit has hit the fan here. There was an article in The Tradesaying that we had to shut down because our lead actress has disappeared. I'm getting calls from buyers wanting to know what the hell is going on. I'm telling everybody that she's not feeling well but I don't know how long I can make them believe that. Hopefully, it should just be a matter of days. I say we catch a flight out of here pronto and head her off at Santa Fe. Why the hell would she be heading there? They know about her house. That doesn't make sense. We got nothing else to go on. And I'm sick of talking to these people. You think she's just sitting there waiting for them to come slap her with a lawsuit? I can't believe how you oscillate between the brilliant and the moronic. It's my special gift. All right, what do you want to do? You're calling the shots. We know she's not here. We're four days behind her. And we're going to continue being four days behind her as long as our only lead is that credit card. We have to see if we can't find something more definitive right here where we have better access to information. Access to information? What are we, the IBM detective agency? We're not getting anywhere, Raymond. We got a tail on her. I say let's move it before she has a change of heart, we get aced out of that 25 grand and end up back on the dog trail. Raymond. Look, all right. This is what we know. Lame production. Actress bombed. They probably told her to drop her top. She flew the coup, said screw it. It's that simple. -Maybe. -Maybe? Raymond, we got a job to do here. Find a missing woman. And what went down here don't mean shit to us unless it's information leading to her whereabouts. I want to stay here just another day before I head off on some wild goose chase. As long as she's still moving, we're just eating her dust. I'll take dust any day over smog. Where are you going? Pick me up at 2:00 a.m. Haines, come on. Listen, baby, they'll come after you when I don't call. -And when they find you... -They'll never find me. And when they find you, they'll do whatever is necessary, you understand? We're in a dangerous area here. Where did you hide the money? I know you have it. You believe them, don't you? I'd do it, too. It's all illegal. Whenever this amount of money is concerned, even the self-righteous are prone to temptation. You want it bad, don't you, Nick? Yeah. I want everything. You're right, I did take it. I took every last cent of it. I thought so. We can get out of here, go to Europe. You ever been to France? I'll take you there. I don't need this stupid life anymore. I want to show it to you. Sure. I've never seen 20 grand before. Sorry, Nicky. I don't like people who don't believe me. Francis, you don't want to shoot me. Haines, come on. You got to get up. Come on, get up. We're leaving this town. What? Barstow. I always wanted to spend a summer in Barstow. -You keep the phone log and receipts, I hope. -Yes, sir. Did you notice anything about her? Well, she came in late. Looked tired. She didn't say much. She left early. Of course, there's not much reason to hang around here. Amen. It's a Santa Fe number. Might be your boy Mueller. 750 to Santa Fe. If we drive all night, we might be able to make it by tomorrow. What's that? Toasted cheese. Oh, good. For a moment, I thought I barfed up my liver. They're right. She hasn't been here. It got a little weird when I mentioned our girl. Mueller's not here. He's at a bar downtown called the El Farol. You mind if we buy you a drink? Not at all. Don't mind if you do. Sit down. -You're an actor? -Yep. I think I remember you from an old series. I can't remember the name though. Empire? Empire,that's it. -Yeah, that's right. -Great show. What was the name of that actress on there? You know her name? Um, Lana something. Lana Dark. That's it. I think this conversation is over. Gentlemen, good night. Assholes. All right, Peter. We know she was here. We have reason to suspect that you saw her. Is she still here? You think I'm gonna tell you lowlives anything? Now, wait a minute. We're both book of the month club members. She might be in trouble. We'd like to help her. What do you think I am, a fool? Read my lips. I'm not gonna tell you anything. All right, one more question. Did she tell you why she walked from the film? You guys are desperate, aren't you? Listen to me, Mueller. We're gonna watch you. We're gonna dog your every waking step. Let him go, Haines. You're never gonna find her. She's too smart for you crackerjacks. Gas in Denver. And a Super 8 motel in Cheyenne, Wyoming. And that's it. Okay, Christine. Thanks. What's she heading north for? It's cold up there. Come on, baby. Hop a flight to the south of France. Make this interesting. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. She's got us on a four-day leash. She's got to stop sometime. We know that. No, I don't know that. You don't know that. She could get all the way to Canada, cross over and hop a flight to Sri Lanka. Boy, what's gotten into you? You lost your sense of humor. Think we'd be doing any better back in LA? I was close to something there. Oh, and what was that? I just don't believe that a woman this smart, this attractive, everything going for her, does what she does. Raymond, have you ever heard of schizophrenia, dementia praecox, manic-depressive? This woman is not crazy. If she was schizophrenic, I don't think she'd be this tough to track. Bullshit. When they're in that zone they're the cleverest people in the world. They even write novels. I've seen you get like this before. -Like what? -Obsessed. You want to believe that this woman is some kind of victim. You remember that painter whose husband hired us to find her? You didn't want to believe that she was screwing half the San Fernando Valley. Remember what you said to her when we finally did find her? You said, "I'm disappointed." I'll never forget that as long as I live. Well, you're a better detective when you're obsessed. I'll give you that. But if you think that when we finally do get to this woman that you're gonna have trouble turning her in, you better just turn around right now and hand this case over to someone else. - What the hell are we doing out here with no spare? Don't get mad at me just 'cause you need a drink. I don't need a drink. When I need one, I'll tell you. All right, why don't we just figure this out? Could you give me a lift into town? Son of a bitch! Hey, come back here! What's so fucking funny? What do you say we go out tonight? Shake it up a little bit. You know, take the night off. No, I'm gonna stay in, read some Kierkegaard. Oh, all right. ♪ I'm a cowboy who never saw a cow ♪ Never rope steer 'cause I don't know how ♪ Yipee ay-oh ki-ay ♪ Yipee ay-oh ki-yay ♪ Buffalo gal, won't you come out tonight? ♪ Come out tonight, come out tonight ♪ Buffalo gal, won't you come out tonight? ♪ And we'll dance by the light of the moon ♪ What are some of the names of the films you've made?

Nick, I can't feel anything. Come on. Don't go out on my, baby. Not here, not now. It's such a beautiful time. We're all so young. Don't talk, baby. I'm not gonna make it. Put me down, get out of here. Be quiet. You're not gonna die. You can't die on me. Listen to me. We're gonna walk out of this thing. We're gonna get you to a hospital. 1-2-3, 4-5-6. Where are all the cars? It's too late at night, Nick. The moon is covered up by clouds. Shh. Save your strength. Too much blood. Hey, stop! I'm sorry. No! Okay, just slow down. Yeah, yeah. Okay, that's it? All right, thanks, Christine. Deadwood, South Dakota. -Haines? -Raymond. I'm in the tank. -Can you bail me out? -Great. Ha, ha. I'm just kidding. No, I got waylaid by a couple of free-spirited pleasure seekers. Well, I'm happy for you, Haines. What's new? Next stop is a town called Deadwood. It's in South Dakota. The Dakotas, huh? How far is that? Oh, 300 miles or so. Oh, well, I guess you're gonna want to get out of here pronto, huh? Haines, if you want to spend another night with those girls, that'd be good for me, too. We've been getting on each other's nerves anyway. Look, I'll tell you what. Tomorrow, I'll catch a bus, the late one. You pick me up at the station. And we're gonna need some more cash. I'll have some wired to us in Deadwood. Yeah, I just need a day off. Clear my head. I figured that. Look, I'll see you in Deadwood, partner. So long. Did someone pick her up or did she have a car waiting? As far as I know, she walked off. -Have you ever seen her before? -No. This is it. Excuse me, that's my phone. You're somewhere around here. But you don't want me to find you, do you? There's a lot of homes out there in the hills, all over. -Okay, thanks. -Thank you. What can I do for you? Do you have a pack of L&M's back there? Yeah. $1.25. Have you ever seen this woman before? What do you want to know? Her stepfather died and I've been hired by the probate people to find her. She's the sole inheritor of quite a bit of money. Yep, I've seen her. You're positive? Oh, yeah. We don't get too many glamour girls around here. When was this? I think it was the day before yesterday. She came driving up in a gray Jeep. She came in and picked up some supplies. Had you ever seen her before? No, first time. Did you happen to notice which way she was heading? The car was pointing that way, so she must have been heading off toward Mystic. -Straight down this road here? -Yeah. Thank you very much. Hey, don't you want your change? No, you keep it. Thanks. Looking for something, mister? Is there a way to get through this road here? It's private. Are you looking for someone? No, I'm just sightseeing, enjoying the countryside. Well, it's a private road and I can't let you go up there unless you know someone. Okay, then. I'll turn around. Lana. What do you want? I've been looking for you. Well, look somewhere else. You're on private property. I just want to talk to you. I'm gonna count to three and if you're not back across that creek, I'm gonna blow your head off. -Just wait a minute. -One. If I turn around, they're gonna be back inside of 24 hours. -Two. -Look, let's make a deal. What kind of a deal? Well, I could discuss it better if I wasn't partially submerged. Who are you? I'm a private investigator. I was hired by Monolith to find you. I've got another shell in here. And I'm at that point in my life where I really don't care about some lowlife detective. It's difficult to organize one's thoughts looking down the barrel of a shotgun. What do you want from me? Money? Miss Dark, listen to me. The moment I set foot in that creek I put my pen on the company's ink. I've never done that before. I think something is wrong and the truth is more important to me than the money. That's perfect. A detective with a conscience. Get back. You're in so deep right now you don't know who to trust or what to do. Any other detective would be at the nearest phone booth by now and this would be over. You don't have any choice. You have to trust me. You shoot me, you might as well shoot yourself. I've been looking for you for almost two weeks. I'm tired. I'm hungry. I'm wet. But forget all that. I think something is screwy here. I can make a phone call, they'll come out here and sue your ass or whatever. But that doesn't interest me. What interests me is you. I have no intention of turning you in. Of course, you can believe that or not. I don't care. What I do care about is why you walked. Because I'd like to help you. Raymond, where are you? What's the matter, is the fresh air too much for you? Whew, man. When there is going to be a full moon I always hike to the top of the ridge to watch it come up. But I can catch you on the way down if you like. No, hold on. So tell me, what is it that you really want from me, Mr. Detective? For you information, the name is Raymond Savage. I have trouble understanding why a woman as intelligent as you flushes her career down the toilet in one rash move, that's all. Who said I was intelligent? I did a lot of research. I know. What did they tell you? Not that I give a damn. Almost nothing. Just find her. You know, I'm impressed. I thought I covered my tracks fairly well. You did. Unfortunately for you, I'm one of the best. I think maybe you were driven by something other than professional obligation. Maybe. Lana, look. I know you don't trust me, and I can't say I blame you. But I am tired of this bullshit. You're in a lot of trouble, a lot more than you realize. Now, I can help you but you've got to be straight with me. 'Cause like it or not, we're in this together now. I hate to disappoint you. But the reason I left was because I was fed up with those people. It's that simple. And they can send an army of guys like you in cheap black suits out here to find me. But I won't go back. They can sue me, they can put a gun to my head. I don't care. I'll never finish that film. You think I'm not in my right mind, don't you? No, and I'm one of the few. Does that make me a fool? How much were they going to pay you? I bet a lot. 25 grand. I might be able to get it. Don't waste your money. They'll just send someone else. If I turn you in, what are you going to do? I don't know. I might have to kill myself. This is right where I'd do it, too. Just like your husband. I fascinate you, don't I? What are you going to do, Mr. Savage? You like me, so you don't want to turn me in. But you don't exactly want to walk away empty-handed either, do you? Where's your car? It's back at the gate. You walked a long way. I guess it would be cruel of me to send you back so late at night. I wouldn't make it if I didn't get a lift. I have a guest house. You can stay the night. Where are you going? Wouldn't it be better for you if you found my house but didn't find me? No. You're in deeper than I am. Yeah, but nobody cares what happens to me. Nobody cares what happens to me. No, you're wrong. I do. You are in way over your head, Mr. Savage. Believe me, I know. No, I don't think you do know. Look, you can't keep running. What are you going to do about it? There's a phone over there, why don't you use it? You see, I am a little crazy. I'm not the angel you think I am. What's the matter, am I destroying your fantasy? You were going to come and rescue the poor little princess in distress. You're drunk. Oh, no. I'm not drunk. I'm so clear-headed, it's unreal. I should have shot you when I had the chance. Yeah, but you didn't. Ow! I'm sorry. Did I hurt you? No. You really do want to help me, don't you? What is it about me? Your eyes. Your mouth. I was afraid you'd left. Do you have a cigarette? I should have told you this before. Raymond, they wanted me to leave. What? They wanted me to leave the film. Who did? Reese and Field. The picture was in trouble and they were running out of money. And they wanted me to take the fall, disappear. Leave some kind of note that made it look like I went crazy and couldn't continue. What? Why? So that they could collect on the insurance. What are you saying to me? Are you in this with them? Is that it? No. If they wanted you to leave, why would they hire me to find you? Because they don't know where I am. What difference does that make? They probably panicked. Why would you go along with something so insane? I didn't go along with it. They offered me a lot of money. I didn't take it. So why didn't you go to the police? Who would have believed me? I would have. Wait a minute. Look at me. Look at me. Are you telling the truth? Yes. Then you have to go back. It's bad enough that you've already walked. The only way is for you to go back, make this public and force them to finish the film. You don't know these people. It isn't that simple. Yes, it is. You don't have any other options. What are you going to do, fade away? End your career, disgraced by these people? My career is over anyway. No. No, everything is just beginning for you. Everything. Well, well, well. It's Ramon Savage. To what do we attribute this visit? Sorry, Haines. Oh. Sorry, Haines. It's okay, Raymond. Pull up a chair, sit down. Take a swig off of this. I don't want any. He doesn't want any. Must have found Jesus. Haines, I don't blame you for being pissed. Oh, hey, Raymond. I discovered a great diet. A friend says he'll meet you somewhere with some money. And guess what? He doesn't show up for two days. The pounds just melt away. I'm gonna call it the get fucked diet. Are you gonna listen to me, or what? Pardon me for being so rude. I found her. Pray tell. She's staying at a house in the middle of the Black Hills. No one could have found her unless they got lucky. And you got lucky. That's right. Well, great. That's it. We can go home. That's not how it's going down. What? Things have changed. Raymond, have you made a certain phone call yet? You know I haven't. Why not? She told me some things. She told you some things. And I bet you're gonna tell me some things. Back off, Haines. Where's my 12-5? -You're gonna get it? -From who? Her. Talk to me, Raymond. Oh, I get it. It's true love. And I didn't think Kierkegaard could fall in love. That's not the only reason. She said that Monolith wanted her to leave. What? They wanted her to leave. So, she split. It had something to do with an insurance scam. I don't know the details but I'm gonna find out. Professional curiosity, huh? That's right. Insurance. Raymond, I don't believe a word of this shit. Well, I do. Of course, you do. The little lady gives you a roll in the hay and suddenly, you're hearing the harps. She's probably on a plane to South America right now. Even if she is, I still believe her. I can't believe I'm hearing this. I thought that I could trust you. I thought that we were partners. You're gonna get your money. Oh, yeah. And I'm Wild Bill Hickok. She's gonna meet us in front of the hotel tomorrow. We'll take care of you. Raymond, have you lost your grip? She's an actress. When was her last film? She doesn't have any money. And I'm not gonna hang around Deadwood, South Dakota while she hocks her villas. I didn't expect you to believe me. What are you going to tell Monolith? That we're calling it off, we couldn't find her? That's right. That pisses me off. Oh! You leave me alone for two days while you do the polka in the Black Forest with the woman that we were hired to find! That's a breach of detective ethics, Raymond. A serious breach. I'm in love with this woman, Jack. And I believe her. I just hope you know what you're doing. I've seen you get this way before. You think you're acting rational. You think you've got everything under control. In the meantime, the whole thing is completely irrational and you end up with nothing. I made my choice. I hope it works out for you. When did you say she was supposed to be here? Don't say it, Haines. Lana? Lana? Raymond, you better come over here. No. No! We got to call somebody, do something. We can't just let her lie there. Hold it right there. Let's go guys. The sheriff wants to see you. Your stories check out. I guess you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Suicide. The only prints on the gun were hers. Besides, what we know about her now, it seems pretty cut and dry. Except what you two were doing out there, but we all have a pretty good idea about that. Pretty actress. In trouble. I think it's a fair guess to say your license will be revoked when you get back to California. Any Hollywood people come out here? No, the story went out on AP and they called to verify. Do they know he was seeing her? They were sent a copy of his deposition. Yes. Where's the body and personal effects? With her aunt over in Sioux Falls. They pushed her to the edge, Haines. I'm going to expose them. Raymond, I'm awfully sorry about what happened but we got our lives to get on with. This is my life. Oh, boy. What is it? Radiator hose. Can you fix it? What the hell? What? Look at that. What is that? A tracking device. An expensive one. Ten-mile range, at least. Somebody is tailing us. What the hell is going on? What are you doing? Hey! -What are you doing? -Nothing. Nothing, my ass. Why are you tailing us? I don't know what you're talking about. What the fuck is this? I was hired to find the actress. I thought you guys were on to something so I followed you. Who you working for? The insurance company. You're a lame son of a bitch. Why are you following us? Ah! My partner is talking to you. Okay, okay. Go easy on the arm. I followed you out here. I couldn't get through the gate but I saw you when you were at that lake. I realized you had something with her. I didn't know what was going on. I called them and told them the story. They said to stay on you because it looked like you were trying to protect her. You guys are in trouble. Big trouble. Oh, scary. Did you contact her? No, just a phone call. That's all. All right. Let him go. Ah! Hey! Hey, that cost 1,000 bucks you son of a bitch. Let it go, Haines. Get out of my sight! And if I find out that you got a reward for this I'll repo every goddamn car you own. I don't own a car! Listen, I found your friend. She told me that they wanted her to leave the picture. They wanted out of it. And I believed her. And I think you know why. Lana had a husband. A director in France. A brilliant guy but a real jerk. They did a film together. A painful film about their relationship. When it came out, he couldn't handle it. It was too personal. So, he killed himself. I know about that. Yeah, but not how it happened. That was kept quiet by his family. The rumors were that he fell out of a window and Lana was there and might have had something to do with it. Of course, nobody that knew her believed that. But she couldn't handle the rumors. So she committed herself for mental exhaustion. What? She spent six months in a mental hospital outside Paris. I was in Europe at the time. I helped her through it. I was the only goddamn friend she had. She came back to do this movie. She needed the money. The movie got in trouble. So they asked her to commit herself again so they could collect the insurance money. Why didn't she call their bluff? Because they threatened her. They threatened to bring up her past, make it look like the picture was in trouble because of her. They made it clear to her that it would be best for both of them if she went through with the plan. I'm sorry. You can't go in there. Yeah, we're sorry, too. Can we help you, gentlemen? You lied to us. You used Lana. I have information that you wanted her to commit herself so you could get out of the picture and collect the insurance money. You're responsible for her death and I'm gonna make sure you don't get a dime. That's interesting. Because the story I have is that you found our actress, slept with her and were going to turn her in. You're a couple of real losers and you're the ones that are responsible for her death, not us. Shut up, all of you. You find Lana. You take advantage of her, a troubled woman. She kills herself before I can help her. -It was your... -Wrong! She was coming back to finish the film. Wrong! We talked to her and she wasn't coming back. She just told you that because she thought you'd buy it and leave her alone. Lana came to us and said she was cracking under the pressure of the film. And we told her if she wanted out of the picture there was a way. A legitimate way. Wait a minute. You talked to her before she died? That's right. And we told her we got her number from you. You son of a bitch. I'm gonna kill you! -Raymond, hold it! -Let go of me! I smell something putrid here. And when I get it in my nostrils like this, I don't let it go! Nobody jerks us around. Nobody! Let's go, Raymond. I burned one real good once. A guy hired me to find some fellow who owed him money. I found him. He turned up two days later at county with two broken legs. Police tried to get me on accessory. Son of a bitches. They didn't like me anyway. I was doing a lot of witness discreditation for defense attorneys. I went after him. Became an obsession. I bugged his ass. I tailed him till he was ready to shit or go blind. He's doing five to 10 now on extortion. You don't mess with Ernie November. You've been set up on something screwy. Forget what they got on Raymond. You go after them. Find the paperwork. That's where it's gonna be. You got to do it for your own piece of mind. Otherwise you'll end up like half these other jamokes, shitfaced over a bar. Film Insurance Group. Joe Petralia, please. Who's calling, please? This is Raymond Savage. I'm a private investigator. What do you want, sir? Tell him that I have something very important I have to talk to him about. Hold, please. I'm sorry, he's not in. If he's not in the office, why do you keep putting me on hold? Hold again. Yes? Raymond Savage, I want to talk to you. Even if what you're saying is true, that they tried to get her to commit herself to try to get out of the picture, then it wouldn't be the first time. It doesn't matter now because she's dead. You wouldn't be interested in saving your company $10 million? Of course, I would. But the unemployment line is littered with failed heroes, Savage. With that woman's past and your only evidence some letter she wrote to this Mueller guy, you haven't got a case. But what if I could prove that they had knowledge of her past and that they used that knowledge to blackmail her? Yeah, if she were alive, we could get them on due diligence, but unfortunately, she's dead. Case closed. All right, I want to see the accounting books on this film. No can do. What's the matter, afraid I might find something? I've heard about you, pal. I know the whole story. In 15 years of this business, I've never heard of a detective who went against his client. You've seen too many movies, Savage. Go home. It's over. There's another reason I don't like you. If you hadn't found her, and frightened her into killing herself, we wouldn't have had to pay. Why is that? We don't pay on disappearance, or non-performance. Wait a minute. What if she refuses to finish the film? We don't pay. She did them a favor by killing herself. Look, Mrs. Durkheim, I'm sorry it's late, but did you find anything like a journal in Laura's things? I have to know. It's very important. I might have to kill myself. And this is right where I'd do it, too. You gonna be all right? If I get in trouble, back me up. It didn't make a hell of a lot of difference to me whether I bought the limited partnership or not, but they thought it was a pretty good tax shelter. There is this woman down in Malibu who channels this 3,000-year-old spirit into her body. I'm really disappointed you didn't invite me to your party. Cheers. Did you come to see me about something? As a matter of fact, I had an idea for a film. I thought you might want to hear it. Ten years ago a beautiful young actress makes a film that vaults her into fame. She has an affair with the producer. When she leaves him, he's crushed. She goes to Europe, falls in love with a director who jumps out of a window. Speculation abounds. Did she push him or didn't she? Distraught, she commits herself. Her career falters. She returns to the States. This same producer decides to revive her career and casts her in a film. But there's a catch. He has no intention of making the picture. It's a front. He pre-sells the film based on a budget overloaded with non-production costs. Skims like a son of a bitch because, you see, he's in debt. He owes money, lots of money. He's gotten used to a lifestyle most of us dream of. How am I doing? Fine. Go on. But he has a plan. Halfway through the film, humiliate the actress. Tell her it would be detrimental to her comeback if it were ever finished. And then when her nerves are frazzled, tell all she has to do is take a walk. Commit herself. But she disappears. Now, the producer has a film that's running out of money. It can't be completed. It's been screwed. So he hires two detectives to find her. One of them finds her. And when he does, he comes face to face with the truth of this monstrous lie. But he convinces her to return. The producer, desperate now because his insurance doesn't pay on disappearance, finds out where she is. He's tipped off by the detective for the insurance company. He goes there, tries to talk her into going through with the original plan. Once again, she refuses. There's an argument and he kills her. Sentimentalist, aren't you? That's not a bad story. But who is going to believe it? I found this down by the stream. Is that where you shot her? I've got a story for you, Sam Spade. A producer tries to make a film. But his lead actress disappears, vanishes because she's a spoiled neurotic. He hires two detectives to find her. But when she turns up dead, they're disappointed. Because they're no longer entitled to the reward money. Disgraced, one of them shows up at the producer's house and threatens him with a gun. The producer is quicker. Now, whose story do you think they'll believe? The false one. They always do. You killed her, didn't you? Now, just for my own piece of mind before you blow me away. Got to hand it to you, Savage. You're a much better detective than I thought. You killed her, didn't you? You killed her because she had too much integrity and that overwhelmed you. Yes, I killed her. And I'm gonna have to kill you now. Put the gun down, Reese. They'll know you murdered me, too. Put it down. It's over, Steve. Give it up, man. So we get this son of a bitch and we go right to the wall with him. I'm telling you, Raymond was brilliant. Brilliant. Here he is. Shot of Black Jack. Raymond, I got some good news for you. This producer read that article about us in the paper and says he wants to make a film about us. He says it's a classic mystery story. You guys are gonna be famous. Now, get this. I figure I'm holding all the cards on this, so I say "You get to write it and I play myself," and he said, "Fine." 25 grand up front on the option. Forget it. Forget it? What are you, nuts? I'm not interested. Raymond, this is for real. This is our break. We can get out of this line of work and go do what we want to do. Haines, it's a lot of talk and you know it. If they ever get around to making the film, they'll bring in Redford to play you and some hotshot young screenwriter to replace me and put some stupid happy ending on the thing. No way, no way. We'll get it in writing. It's personal, and I keep the personal to myself. I said that we'd think about it. Haines, we're detectives. That's all we are. Maybe someday we'll be something else. Maybe I'll write the long goodbye and you'll play King Lear. Right now we're just detectives. Pretty damn good ones. Why sell out like everyone else?
