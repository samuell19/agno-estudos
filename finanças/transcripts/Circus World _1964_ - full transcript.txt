Matt Let the ghost be. Its fourteen years. Its time you buried the dead. They're buried, Cap. Bust you wanna walk over their grave again, to make sure. Got a great idea: European Tour. - What do you say? - Its no good. Berlin, Madrid, Paris, Vienna, Budapest. They got a nice sound. Europe's just a big Jonah for American circuses. - They were in for the money. - And you ain't? I love a circus. Matt, Lili's gone. Forget her. When she ran out that night it was over. Like that puff ofwind. Its gone. Matt, Let it stay that way. Got a lot to do tomorrow, Cap. Ladies and gentlemen! You have witnessed our last performance of the season. Tomorrow our circus bids goodbye to its native land, the U.S.A. and sails for Europe, to raise our tents in all its capitals. At this time the ushers sell tickets for celebrating our attraction. However, tonight, we invite you to be our guests. And now, the greatest Wild West Show in the World! On your mark. And now, the Great Stage Coach robbery! You are now about to witness a race between man and beast. Ladies and gentlemen, the Roman Race! Toni, are you all right? - Are you hurt? - No. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Are you all right, Toni? - It's nothing. - Yes. - Get the next act on, Cap! - Yes, sir. - Have May drive for Toni. - Right! Are you sure you are O.K? Yes. What happened? There was a bird in the tent. Ladies and gentlemen, We offer you tonight, a cast of daring with hair raising feats of skill. Still seeing things, eh? It was there, that's why I slipped. A bird in the tent is one of the very worst omens. There's no sense on superstitions, Toni. Its unreal. Part of a make-believe world. What's wrong with a Make-believe world? Its for weak people, to hide in. I m not hiding in anything, Matt. Look at that rabbit's foot around your neck! Horse hair in your handkerchief and owl feathers. You can't perform with things like that in your mind. It's dangerous. Matt, those are good omens, like you. Your are a good omen. All good omens make good things happen. I guess I raised you wrong. No, you haven't. You raised me as good as any real father could. What are you afraid of, Toni? Almost everything. I was scared of going to Europe. This morning I found a milk white butterfly. That means I'm going to have a wonderful trip. A butterfly is a moth. A moth means moth holes. It's all bunkum: omens, hexes, voodoo... It's all bunkum. Come in! I'll prove it to you. Oh, no, bread and butter! Oh, Matt, please! - Leave the hat there. - The hat is on the bed. Leave it there, Toni! Now! Oh, stand back! Because I'm going to bust a ten dollar mirror. But, it would be cheap if it proves to you that superstitions are for crazy heads. Dont be scared. It doesn't count if you do it on purpose. Scared? That mirror business is all bunkum. I was just a little careless. Well! Its a good thing. It was a Stetson. You can't say I didn't try. Matt, I don t worry about omens when you re around. Because when you love somebody, nothing can hurt you. And, I Iove you, Matt. You sure cheer a fella up. You better get to finishing your packing. I'll got Steve to pick you up. Oh, I'm glad you found that lousy milk white butterfly. That was a lot of yelling you were doing to Toni. Family discussion. You can't get away from the fact that there was a bird in that tent, the night that Alfredo fell and her ma ran out. You got anything else on your mind? Yes, I have Lili. If you're going to Europe, you better do a little thinking about her. She's liable to come out to get a look at her daughter. We'll take care of it. Why don't you mind your own business? You got a circus to get moving. Steve! Glad you signed for the tour. You shouldn't be. - Bad news? - Are you up to hearing it? I was weaned on it. Well, at first I was thinking about trying to talk you out of this european tour. But then I figured, just let him go bust and I'll be around... You'd step in: New acts, new flags in the tent, new money thrown at you. You're not sore? Why should I be? That's the way I started ten years ago. Got tired of being a rodeo bum, grabbed an expiring big top, kicked everybody out and took over. That's exactly my plan. I've been clear, Matt. You want to fire me? No, you'd better stick around. I'll feel better if I know there's a new genius handy to take over. At the meantime, will you bring Toni to the ship? Say, Matt... You wouldn't consider skiping this... European thing and...? I'm asking as a friend. Thanks for saying that, Steve. Shows you ve got a big heart, almost as big as your head. Ship leaves at two. Hello, boss! Come in. Oh, Steve! Matt asked me to come by and take you to the ship. Come in, come in! I'll be ready in a few minutes. Come in! Come! This is almost my favorite. Toni, don't you ever get tired of looking at the same stuff? Oh, Steve! Look at this one. Where he's holding me over his head. I've seen it fifty times. Alfredo, famed circus star, starts training daughter Toni for a trapeze career. Toni will be the greatest of the flying Alfredos. - Says Father. - Says Father. - That's something new, isn't? - Yes. I put it in last week. Isn't he sweet looking? He's a Saint, who watches over the beautiful souls in Paradise. You know? That's where Alfredo is. What are those things? Owl feathers. They protect you from falling. You know? Paradise is pretty high up. You know? I think you're a little crazy. Come on, Toni, finish packing, will you? What's this? Too small for you, aren't they? My first birthday present from my Uncle Aldo. They're cute! Come in, hurry up, Toni! I haven't got all night. I'll hurry, if you'll take me to the bon voyage party. There's no chance. It's no place for kids. Kids? I am a woman with a sicilian heart. You ever hear of a vendetta? Would you stop making those faces! It makes you look nutty. Sicilians are sensitive like horses and proud. You just remember that. When you insult a Sicilian it's for all his life and yours. That's a vendetta. Thank you. Thank you very much for the information. Now, are you coming, or not? Go by yourself. Go on. Go. All right! Steve! Steve! I hope you get seasick. All the way. Take her all the way up. That's it. Hold it. All right, swing it in. Take it in. Take it in. Come on, there! You did it! That's my point! Let it ride, boys! Fifty! Cover me! Snake eyes! Pardon me. I'm Billy Hannegan of Billboard Magazine. By the way, aren't you the daughter of the world's most renowned artists, - the Flying Alfredos? - Yes. I knew it, I knew it the first time I saw you. Oh, Lili's beautiful face and the carriage. It's unmistakable. Did you know my father? Oh, we were great chums, yeah. - Any news of your mother? - I don't care to talk about her. It's been fourteen years since she disappeared, hasn't it? I don't know. I think it has. The night since your father had his fatal accident, fourteen years to the day. I undertand that you've never heard from your mother since that sad night? Well, if it isn't my old pal Hannegan! If theres anything I'm gonna miss in Europe ..it's the Billboard Magazine and Hannegan. - Bring me a cup of coffee, will you? - Yes, Matt. But, coffee is on board. You're spoiling a good feature story, Matt. -The story is dead. - No, no, not this one, my dear friend. It's just coming alive: Will the renowned Lili Alfredo come out of hiding to greet her lovely daughter as a fellow artist? - Shake down. - Oh, no, no, no. There's a real tear in it. How much will Billboard Magazine pay for this tear? Well, if I let myself go, I, I might fill 25 dollars worth of space with it. Here's fifty. Write it for me. Send it to Matt Masters, somewhere in Europe. That's very good of you, Matt. I appreciate talent. - I don't deserve it. - I agree. The key to the city. Barcelona is yours. Much?simas gracias, se?or Alcalde. Ladies and gentlemen! The slide for life! Here. I'm all right. Bring out those cargo knots. Get them over the side. Get a move on! Bring out those cargo nets! The cargo nets! Hi, Simba! Oh, boy, oh, boy. Whoa, boy! Easy, easy. Yah! Get in the cage! Get back in the cage! Cap! Cap! Cap! Swing that boom around. Give me a line. Okay. Will you swing that boom right over to him? How's Toni? Where's Toni? She's all right. She's on a lifeboat. If we lose that canvas we're out of business. Look, your honor. Tell him that we ve got divers down in the hold, right now, looking for the safe and the cash boxes. We're doing the best we can. Explain that to him. He says they are looking for the safe and the cash boxes. - That's where I'm going. - Stop, stop, stop. - You wait here. - No, no, no. He won't give me the feed for the animals until he get paid. - Well, hang on and keep talking. - I've been talking, Matt. He's muy simp?tico, he's very sorry. He's for feeding the animals, but he's also got a family to feed. Well, keep conversing with him. We' ve got the divers - coming up back, maybe. - Se?or, The Port Master said with the deepest sympathy for your problem, he says he's sorry but it is necessary either that your ship be removed as soon as possible. Well, I understand him, and I sympathize with him, and we are going to remove it as soon as possible. He says he's very grateful... Matt, I hate to bother you right now, but could you help them? They're broke, nothing to eat. No place to sleep. Honey, how can I...? You got any money? Well...no. - Pio? - No. And you, Toni? Me? Nothing. Same here. Havent got a nickel, not a sou , not a peseta. - Mr. Masters. - Yes, Your Honor? The Harbor Master says and believe me, he deeply regrets that if you do not remove the ship, it becomes the responsability of the Port Authority and it might be most expensive for you if they... Well, let him take it, salvage it. You're welcome to it. I just hope there'll be a little left for our expenses. He says that there's no solution. Hey Matt! Matt! They just brought up some of the boxes. Isn't that a picture of my mother? Yes, it is. Here, pay the men and get some meat for those cats. Spread this among the performers and get them something to eat. Yes, Matt. Looks like he's trying to work off his miseries. Miseries he's got, mister. All his animals are boarded in Spain. Nothing left in the cage boxes. And still he's trying to kill himself. Hey, Toni! Toni, I've got it! That s a part of the act that made him a star, remember? He used to jump off the hotel roof and make his getaway? If he's thinking what I'm thinking, it's time to talk to the man. Come on! Hey, Matt! You've got a few minutes? - What do you want? - Well... While you're still able to talk, I'd like to hear you say when we're going home. - We are not going home. - Oh, Matt, you can't stay here. You're broke. I'm not broke. I got myself a job with Ed Purdy. You got a job with Ed Purdy! When a fella's out of work, he gets himself a job. No with Ed Purdy, you don't. Look, Matt! Back home you got friends, you got contacts, You can hook something good for all of us. Well, I only asked for a job for myself. I'm in no position to ask favors to anyone else. You all can go or stay, as you please. What about you, Toni? You wanna go home? Home... is where you are. What about you? I thought you were going to stick around at pieces. Where're you going? Where do you suppose? I'm going to see Ed Purdy about getting a job and I'll settle for a partnership you and me. Partnership! That's a very attractive offer, Mr. McCabe. A fella doesn't very often get a chance to go in partnership with a horse-riding pauper. It's what you need right now, a partner. You figuring on being a partner to me or anybody, you'd better go out and earn it. Among the things I'm good at is, taking advice from my elders. I'll go with you. Elders! Partners! That Texas punk! You should have belted him. Look! Why don't you be a good boy, take your hat in your hand, go over to Purdy and see if you can borrow some equipment for those kids to practice. - Old Ed Purdy! - That's right. He better be careful the way he talks to me! I knew that phoney when... If he tries to pull anything on me, I'll show him! Come on! Sure not causing much excitement. It's pretty dreary. Kind of quiet, huh? Yep. - Wanna change it? - How? Let's go into the opening act. You gotta be kidding! Just take the cue, boy. Take the cue! - What's happening? -Just hang on. What? Matt Masters! You're not going to... Oh, yes, we are. Let's go! Steve! Steve, stop it! - Matt! - Come on! Knock on that! Matt! Thank you. Monsieur, je vous en prie. Une photo. - Why not? - Attention! Attention! ?a c'est tout! Je vous remercie, monsieur. Monsieur Americain, Matt Masters l'artiste celebrant le Wild West h?roiquement arrete une coach de Deadwood Dick au Champs Elys?es. Bravo, Matt Masters! Premier artiste de la Far West! Purdy was sore at you when he saw that crowd tonight. 0h! Why didn't you tell him all it was your idea? He might have made you a partner! You've had your jokes. You've finished your dinner. Do you want me to answer these telegrams or not? One's Hagenbeck in Copenhagen. There's one from London, Associated Shows. Can use your animals? How much? Have a spot for Liberty Horses. How much? - Answering? - Sure. What are you trying to do, get me drunk? To be frank, yes. That way you might say a fewwords about our secret future. Well, you don't have to get me drunk, I'm gonna build a new show. I swear I'll never use that dirty word again, but when do we sail? We don't. We stay right here. You can't build a circus here, in Paris. There ain't five Frenchmen that can sit a horse. Always thinking of a dog and pony show. I am talking about a Circus. Europe is the home of the Circus. All the big acts came from here, Belgium, Germany, France... The big name families: The Hannefords, the Bradnas, the people that spell Circus. They were born here. So I figured that while we're taking this little tour in Europe at Purdy's expense, we can pick up a few of these great acts, and build a real show. Matt, I'm for it! That's new thinking. Showmanship, that's what I'm good at. We can latch on to them before Barnum, before Sells-Flot all the rest. Say, the Medrano Circus is in town. I'll go over and see if they got anything good enough for the new Master-McCabe United Shows. Come in, Toni! I llok that I might be a silent partner, but I'm a partner. - You mind if I go? - If you can stand him. Well, at least he gives me top billing. Now listen. Not that I'm gonna object to anything, anymore, but I wanna get this straight. We stay with Purdy for the rest of the European playdates, and in our spare time we visit carnivals and look and look? That's about the size of it. I look and look... And you're gonna find Lili. Sure! Lili Alfredo! That's why we stumble in around Europe. You still love her. Why don't you get drunk! You plastered this Continent for two solid years with cablegrams. - Where's Lili? Where's Lili? - Not for me, for Toni. I stopped looking when Toni was four. You're still looking. Get this in that empty head of yours and keep at there! Lili is alive I could'nt care less and if she's dead, I m not mourning her. Alive or dead, she's gone. - Where are you going? - To get some fresh air. It's too hot in here from that torch you're carrying. - Aren't they wonderful? - Yeah. That little girl is wonderful too. - Tojo, I m delighted. - Glad to see you, Mr. Masters. Thank you. We've heard about your terrible misfortune. We're all very sorry about it. But I understand you're looking for some acts for a new circus. That's right, Giorgio. That's what I wanna talk to you about. Oh, good! Would you like to come in, please? - Thank you. - If you don't mind, - I'll take this stuff off. - All right. I'll only be a minute. Take your time. Hello. - What's your name? - Giovanna, sir. I bet you love the ballet? Oh, yes, I do. I've been studying a long time, since I was five. That make-believe wire act you do is beautiful. Thank you, sir. I wondered, could you really walk a high wire? - No, sir. I've never tried. - That's too bad. It would be wonderful if you could... Ballet dancing on a wire. -Oh! -The ballerina and the clown in the hinge wire act. Interested, Tojo? Yes, very much. Uncle Tojo will teach me to dance in a high wire. I will be very good. - Honest. - I believe you. Still the fine showman. Eh, Matt? - Aldo. - Yes. Aldo Alfredo, formerly of... the Three Alfredos. Where's Lili? Haven't you heard from her? - Where's Lili? - I don't know. The last time I saw her was in Copenhagen. She was... she was working in a show under another name. When I went over to speak to her, she ran away. I...I dont know if it's true, but now I hear she is in... Hamburg. Now, I suppose you're not interested any more in...? In the ballerina and the clown on the high wire? I'm not buying trouble. Look, Matt. There'll be no trouble. I'm only interested in Giovanna's future. - A success. - Well, well, well! Looks like you finally found something. - Aldo Alfredo. - Cap Carson. You can't give this guy a job! It's like hiring your own executioner! That's over. The story of my brother is forgotten. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Matt... - Oh, isn't she lovely! - Beautiful. - You're Toni Alfredo? - Yes, I am. Well, Toni, I'd like to meet my niece: Giovanna. - Hello. - Hello. - And I'm Tojo, the clown. How do you do? I saw you dancing. You're lovely. It will be much better on the high wire. Please, Mr. Masters! Will you take us? That's, is up to your uncle. Giovanna and I will be very happy to join you. - Won't we? - Yes. Well, Toni, it looks like we've hired ourselves an act, and if you don't change your mind, we winter quarter in Madrid. See you there. Good luck. No, not good luck. It's bad to wish good luck. You kick them and say: Break a leg. Of course, break a leg. - Oh, good job. - Giovanna, work hard. I will, I promise. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Bye, bye. - Bye. Wait here. I'm gonna talk to this act. Is there something you want? I'd Iike to talk to Mr. Schuman when it's convenient. I'm Mrs. Schuman. What do you want? Oh, Mrs. Schuman, I'm Matt Masters. We re getting together a circus... I know, Mr. Master. You don't need to tell me. Everybody knows. News travels fast in Circus World. Yes, I guess that answers all the questions except the important one: Are you interested? Listen, Emile has been doing this act for three seasons now. Every season they ask for more lions to be sitting on him. I mean, lying down on him. Emile is getting very tired of lions. I can't say that I blame him. But I've something else in mind. - What? - Tigers. - Tigers! - You want me to lie down in the cage and the tigers lie on top of me? No, monsieur! Emile! No snap judgment. Every time a lion drops on me, I'm playing Russian Roulette. But tigers? No, monsieur, no, no! Let's get down to business. I bought these lions for Emile. If you expect me now to buy... No, we have plenty of tigers. All right, then. I'll speak to my husband, until he makes the right decision. Good. Thank you. Emile, this is our biggest opportunity. You need to change your acting, Emile. Isn't she lovely? Lili's girl. She's beautiful, huh? Hello, Mr. Masters. You don't remember me, I bet. Flo Hunt, tumbling act. That's me! Broke me back. No more cartwheels. -Got married. Four kids. Easier work. - Great. - I'm wardrobe here. - Good. The girls are longing to meet you, Mr. Masters. Fritzie, Anna. - Ladies. - I was telling them about Toni. Haven't seen her since she was five. I recognized her. Same beautiful face as Lili. Fritzie knows Lili. Oh, a tragedy that Lili! Maybe seeing her daughter will help? Seeing her? You mean, she hasn't? But she's here in Hamburg. Lili? Don't worry. She'll turn up. Yes, Mr. Masters. In Leipzig she talked all the time about Toni. Oh, do you have Lili's address? I knew where she lived a month ago. but I meant to write. Yes? Mr. Masters... Pardon me. Be right back. My husband says: No tigers. - Oh, I'm sorry. - But I like the idea. It's new faces in the act. So, don't worry. I know how to handle him. I will let you know. My husband always does the right thing in the end. Thanks. Aman is lucky to have a smart woman to guide him. - Thank you. - I'll be glad to listen from you soon. You will. I got it! Let me write it down. - A beer. - Ja vohl! I'm looking for someone. This picture was taken some time ago. Have you seen her? Ja, ja volhl! That's Margot. She's around sometimes. Well, good. Maybe you could give me her address. Her address? She's living upstairs. Well... is she in now? No, she's been gone for a few days. Could I look at her room? Sure, of course, of course. Sure. - Hilda! - Yeah? Der Americano. What's up? Show this gentleman Margot's room. - Margot? She's not there. -Show him the room. All right. This way, mister. - You know Margot? - Yes, I do. She doesn't come back for two days. Always getting lost. Lot of girls like that and you can tell the ones want to get lost. Like Margot, you see her and then you don't see her for longtime. Voil?! Looks to me she's not coming back. God knows there is no much to come back to. I asked Margot once: Why do you pick out a room so plain, like a prison? So he says: 'Plain is more peaceful, like in the convent'. - Convent? - Yeah. She was in the convent. Nobody's allowed to talk there. Just work and pray. She told me. She wants to be a nun, so she can forget. Do you understand? Get lost, you know. You know that can get lost good in one of those women's religious places. Yeah, you can see that there, she still got all that stuff. Crosses, beads, little books, candles, everything. Are you a relative? No, no relative. Friend? Yes, I was, a long time ago. Are you what she was trying to forget? I was part of it. Merci. When you see Margote, will say hello from Hilda? I will, Hilda. - Good. - Much obliged. One. May I? I mean, if you're not using them. - Yes, of course you can. -Thank you. I yuou're finished, do you need the binoculars? Toni, are you all right? I think so. What happened? I was out there, everything was going fine. I had a good hold, then... ...then, I got a strange feeling. I don't know why. At least, there wasn't a bird in the tent. Come on, we'll have Doc look at that. How's the ankle, Toni? It will be fine with this tight bandage. Good. I'm going to change. Now stand on it Toni. See how that feels. It's all right, Doctor. Put your boot on and it'll keep the swelling down. Thank you. Good. - You forgot your things. - Oh, thanks. Is it very bad your ankle? No, I sprain something all the time. Soak it tonight in salt. That's very good for sprains. Really? You're a circus performer. I mean, used to be. How can you tell? From the way you stand. Yes, I used to work in shows. Did you ever work up high? They won't let me, but I sneak in a lot of practice. On the trapeze? Yes, flying. And I'm going at it, too. Because my father was the best in the world. If you've been in shows, you must have heard of him: The Flying Alfredo. Yes, I heard of him. Years ago. He was the only who ever did a triple somersault. Nobody has ever done it since him. Was your mother in the circus? I don't remember. Could I ask you something personal? What's that? - If you're looking for a job, I... - Oh! Thank you. You are very kind. I like talking to old circus performers. I'm sorry, I didn't mean old, I mean... veterans. And I like talking to the young ones. Especially a girl who's going to be a big star. Maybe, if the omens are right. - Oh, I'm on the next. -Hey, Toni! - Yes? - Can you make it? Yes. Easy. - Okay, two minutes. - Goodbye. Is something the matter? Oh, no. It's been so nice talking to you. - Good luck. - Thank you. Goodbye. Where's the shot gun? Come on. Get up on it. Well, it happened. - What? - I just saw an old friend of yours. - Where is she? - Over by the hospital. Lili! Leave me alone! Oh, Lili! Changed a little bit, people change. It' s been a long time, Matt. Nearly fifteen years. Oh, Matt, don't look at me! I saw a friend of yours in Hamburg. She said to say hello. Hilda? You were there? Oh, Matt! Why, Lili? Why? Answer me! Why did you do it? Leave me alone! How long do you think you can keep running away? How long are you gonna flop around in cheap joints sucking your soul? I killed him! I killed... Se?ora? What are you hiding from, Lili? I killed Alfredo. Just as if I'd used a knife. I killed him! All right. You killed him or I did, or maybe it was something neither of us could help or anybody. Because God knows we didn't just wake up one morning and say: Today we're gonna fall in love. But it happened, though. What happened, happened, Lili. You've paid. Go away, Matt! Find yourself a life with someone. Let's forget about us. Say that's over, finished, through. You've got a daughter. What about her? That night when... I saw... Alfredo dead, I ran outside. People stared, I was still in costume. The only place I could find to hide was in a church. In the morning the nuns found me. They gave me clothes. They were kind to me. And... it was a heaven. It seemed like an answer. A convent! You took the easy way. Easy? I had to give up Toni. But she had you, Matt. You've been good for her. They're some things a man just can't do. She has to learn from a woman, from her mother! She needs you! How can I? Look at me. What would you do? I'd wash my face, I'd comb my hair and make myself decent enough to go up to that little girl and say: I'm your mother . It's too late! I'm too tired! Too late! Still full of self pity! Cognac! Make up your mind or you're forever dead. -Toni, come here, please. - Me? -Take your hat off. - My hat off? Put the funnel on your head. No, the other way round. Now, when you catch the ball in the funnel... - Give me... - Five dollars! Ready? One! One! Two! Five dollars! Don't move now. Don't move. One, two, two and a half, Go! Jos?! Put this in the safe. Hard paying bills without money. Take finesse. We did all right today, 81 kids, 77 grown-ups, 6 dead heads. Total: 259 pesetas. - That's 43 dollars American. - Very good. Eight thousand more and we get our tent. - That's right. - Any other problem? Yes. You do have a problem. Toni. She's sick and tired of playing clown. She got some of the wardrobe girls fixing her up a fancy costume. She's going for the high trapeze. They'll fix her a costume but she isn't gonna wear it. You let me know if she does. I'll let you know. Now, there be a good girl, run up. Good girl. Run up, please. Please, lady. Come in! No, you can't do anything by standing outside. Come on. Get inside! Look! Look at them, they hate me. I don't want people to think you're a coward. You think she'll get him to go in there? She got him all the way from Hamburg to Madrid. I'll be able to get them in a cage. It's a big difference, lions to tigers. Wives don't notice such things. Hello, Maggie. How's the leg? Fine. Thank you. You're one foot higher today, but it doesn't matter. It's the same. Now, never look at your feet. Never! Look right here. You walk with your eyes. You, ready? - Yes. - Go. - Nice work, Giovanna. -Thank you. Look right here. - I'm sorry, Aldo. - It's all right. Haven't you got some rehearsing to do? - Yes, Sir. - Well, get at it. All right Toni, you've had your fun. Come on down. Matt, I'm learning beautifully. I dont want you learning anything. I catch you up in the air again, I'll put you back in the kitchen. You hear me? Get down. Come on down. Haven't you something to do, riding a horse or something? Well, yeah, but, well, I... You know... Come on, Toni. - You look beautiful! - Yeah. Oh, yeah. Go ride your horse. That's a nice looking outfit. New? Yes, the wardrobe girls made it for me. Oh, has Matt seen it? No, I didn't put it on for him. Do you like it? I'm getting used to it. You'd rather I wore the Salvation Army dress? No, you look much better in this rig, but, different. How, different? Better different or worst different? Well, better different for me. Matt, he's gonna... Matt will make faces. He always does. But they never last long. He'll be all right by tomorrow, or... or anyway the day after. Toni told me you bawled her out this morning. Yes, I did. For going up on the high trapeze? Look, with Lili for a mother and Alfredo for a father, isn't that kind like bawling out a duck - for taking the water? - She's just a kid. Are you gonna tell Toni that, ...well, that you saw her mother? - It's your play. - Are you? No, I'm not, and it's your move and quit reminding me. Yeah, she's growing up fast. Looks like her baby days are over. It's the most wonderful day in my life. I'm a woman, I love everybody. - Well! - You. I wanna talk to you. - You kissed Toni. - Did I? Well, you encouraged her, I saw it. Grabbing her and whirling her around. That's called dancing. I like called it. A man like you taking advantage of a kid! Do you deny it? - I deny nothing. I was... - I'm not gonna belt you. Belt me! You sounded off in Paris about wanting to be my partner. - That's right. - Well, mister, you're certainly going about it in the wrong way. Making like this this with Toni, that you'll get nothing except a busted head. A busted head? I've never seen anything as cheap and disgusting as the way you been working... -...your way into that little girl... - Matt, can't I say something? - Say it. - She's a woman. Not yet she isn't and she isn't going to be made into one by any flight-by-night Circus bum. When Toni meets a man it's gonna be for true love, no penny-ante fella using her for a blue chip. You figured me about as wrong as any man possibly could. -Steve, where are you going? - Steering clear at you. - Steven... - Listen, do me a favor. Just stay away from me. I don't want a busted head. Matt Masters, you're a bully. What are you trying to do, ruin my life? No, wait a minute. - Don't treat me like a baby. - I didn't call you a baby. No, but if you had your way, I'd be cooped up in a play-pen with dolls or in a high chair eating mush and drinking milk out of the bottle. And my clothes! Look: I'm still wearing bloomers. Maybe you're a little grown-up, but I've been trying to help you... Help me! Make me look like an idiot in front of everybody. I'll never forgive you. I'm going to grow up and you're not going to stop me. I can't stop you. You aren't a kid any more. Then what am I? Say it, just at me. Let me hear you say it once. just once. You're a woman, Toni. I got eyes. I can see it. You're a beautiful young woman. - You're starting... - Then why? Please, just let me talk. There's a lot of things that I should've said before, but I can't... Go on. It's time you learned some facts. You know facts of life. - I'm listening. - Sometimes, with two people, well, things can get out of hand, sometimes, and it's the woman that has be strong. A man is generally no better than he has to be. Look at those idiots today ogling you and whispering. Oh! Because I wore that costume. Why? Everybody loved it. There isn't a man in this place you can trust. But there are exceptions. A girl has to get married, sometimes. Toni, I'm not talking about Steve or any man. It's you that matters. I don't want you to start off stumbling. But, I'm in love, Matt. Honest. In love. I guess maybe you are. I dont know what to tell you. Maybe you won't get hurt, but I just dont want you to do your first dive without a net. That's all. It's funny. When I came in I wanted to kill you. I'm glad you changed your mind. Matt, there's something you're not saying. Something sad in you. I've felt it before. Nothing like that. It isn't anything I've done, is it? No, Toni. You've given me nothing but good things, happiness. And I'm grateful. Oh Matt, I owe you so much. And please, don't worry. If I do any high dive, I'll use a net. Hey, Matt! You coming to supper? No, and close that door. Kind of cozy in here. Oh, Schuman claims one of his tigers has got indigestion. He wants a doctor to examine him. I told him flat, I don't know any tiger doctors. Go on to supper. Don't bother me. What's on the program, Matt? I don't know. Maybe we ought to take the new Matt Master's Circus and dump it in the junk yard. Are you crazy? We're only 2000 bucks shy on the price of a tent. I'm shy a lot more than that. Matt, just come on, let's supper. They got a new rice dish. Well, you eat it. Look, I gotta go through all these mail, letters from agents, phony acts... Why always is come crawling out? - Matt, you're putting on a circus. - Am I? Well, it's my opinion. In a circus you have to have artist flying through the air, like musical notes, somebody making a tune with them. Somebody with a calliope inside... Calliope? Weel, you got steam coming out of your ears. Go away, Cap. Okay. And close the door. I think you and the tiger both need a doctor. Hello, Lili. Hello, Cap. Kinda wet out of here, but, might be worst inside. Will you make up your mind and stop opening and close? Well, I washed my face and... I combed my hair. Look any better? About eight pounds better. Seven. A rope and a rigging will take off another seven. Matt, do you have a spot for another performer? - Lili, I... - Just a performer, no relative. She'll know you. Not for a long time, Matt. And, if you don't want it, never. - I just don't want to be a performer, working near her. - Matt. Hey, Matt! You in there! Oh, you're the lady who told me about salt for my ankle. I thought you were looking for a job. Yes, I was just talking to Mr. Masters about it. - What's your act? - High trapeze. - Oh, I love that. Matt, you haven't got one woman working high. We need someone. What is your full name? - Margot Angeli. - I'm Toni Alfredo. Will you join us for supper, Margot? Well, I have to unpack, Toni. Have you eaten, Miss Angeli? No, I haven't. Well, you're more than welcome to join us. Oh, fine! Under here you won't get wet. Good morning, Miss Angeli. You're early. It's been a long time. I need some practice. Well, your rigging's secure. - Thanks, Cap. - Any time. You're all right. You only fainted. You just lie quiet and you'll be fine. You'll be all right. You're Aldo. I shouldn' t have surprised you that way. - I thought... - Did I upset you? Oh, it's nothing, Matt. She just had a little shock. I thought she knew I was here. I'm sorry. You fell. You're not going up again. But, it had nothing to do with my strength. It was Aldo... He stood there looking at me in Alfredo's eyes, in Alfredo's clothes. I... I thought it was Alfredo. It was just my imagination. I wonder. Well, anyway it won't work out, Lili. It can't. Because of Aldo? I'm not afraid of him. Not Aldo, you. You and Toni. But she likes me, Matt. Last night... Last night you were somebody in the rain. No, there's more to it than that. She feels something. Well, that's a feeling you're not going to like. You're a blacked out figure in her scrapbook, Lili, and in her life. And I did that, and I meant to do it. Way back, when she was a little kid, She blamed herself because you'd gone away. It took a long time to convince her it wasn't her fault. I could have told her the truth, but I didn't. I lied. So she blacked you out, like I blacked you out. I taught her that. Then, why did you go to Hamburg? Oh Matt, let me stay until she finds out. Maybe by then she'll get to know me. I'm not a monster. She's been hurt once. That's enough. Well, if she hates me, it won't hurt her to find out. She may curse me, spit at me and tell me to get out. She has a right. And if she tells me to go, I'll go. It won't hurt her to have revenge. What happens to you? I'll take my chances. You've got guts, Lili. I hope you win. - Isn't it wonderful? - Oh, yeah. - What's the matter, Steve? - Oh, nothing. Yes, you kept your eyes open when you kissed me. I was doing sentry duty. Oh, stop worrying about Matt. He isn't here. Toni, he's all over the places. I don't like acting like two kids, scared of Matt. - Do you like that, Toni? - Not entirely. I didn't tell you what was biting him, because I didn't want to bother you. But, he thinks that I'm courting you so I can become his partner. Using you to blackmail him. He's a flathead! You could have told him he was talking crazy. I didn't have much chance. But I'm going to... - Oh, do you have to leave right now? - Yes. And I'm telling Matt Masters I wouldn't be his partner, even he bated me! And the only part I want is Toni Alfredo. - Do you have to tell him now? - Yes, you coming? Sure. Wait a minute! Now, what are you doing? For good luck on a journey. You're going to need some. - Now? - Now. Well! Back together again, eh? Glad to see you two have made up. Happy faces, that's what we need in the Circus. How you doing with your trapeze, honey? I'm doing fine everywhere. Well, dont waste it on me. Him! And now you can go back to your secret hiding place, but nobody knows about. - Thank you, Goliath. - Any time, Miss Margot. - Good morning. - Good morning. You do those turns just beautifully. I thought I was rather stiff. I've seen you work before Somewhere. - No, no. I doubt that. - I'm sure I have. Where did you work in the United States? Oh, it s been a long time, Toni. And not in any shows you've ever seen. I've seen a lot of shows with Matt. Name the shows you were in, and I bet you I remember. Well, how did it go today, Miss Angeli. - Twenty five turns. - Wonderful. - Five more than yesterday. - Great. Matt, I just told Margot that I... What are you doing in the ground? I thought I wanted to be an aerialist and you'd work on it. Go on! I'd Iike to see you doing twenty five planches. That's easy. Just watch. - Thanks for saving me. - What brought that on? Will you count for me? I'm counting. I dont know. When she was a little girl, she used to sit on the ring curb and watch me work out. I remember. That's how she learned to count, counting your turns. How much does she know about her father and me? She knows her father died in a fall and you disappeared. How much does she know about you? Well, I spanked her when she was bad, loved her when she was good. I'm just there like night and day and she never question it. Would you be afraid to let her know the truth, about what happened? It'd be a lie to say I wasn't afraid. I don't want to lose her, Lili. She's like my own. She needn't ever know. Oh, I intend to tell her sometime, - take my chances. - How many? - Fifteen. - Fifteen? It's twenty-two! Fifteen's my count. Start over. But, start over! That's not fair! Hey, Matt! Matt, it's here the canvas! The tent! It's coming right up the road! - Hey Toni, come on! - Come on, everybody! - The tent! - Here's the tent! - The tent's here! Come on! Let s go! What about the party? Let's go for it! After we get the tent up. - Hello, boss. - Thanks, Goliath. That deserves some coffee, what do you say? - I'd love some. - Then, Cap, let's get it. Dance with an old friend, Lili? And old friend, Aldo? And old enemy, then. You haven't forgiven me yet, have you? In Sicily we say: Those who want forgiveness, first must knock at the gates and wait for the devil to answer. Haven't I waited long enough? - Why, that big...! - Get off at Matt! Leave them alone! Leave them alone? It's dark out there! - Well, kids like the dark. Weren't you ever young? - I don't know. Why don't you mind your own business? Give me some coffee. Come on. - Where's Lili? - She's right. I guess she's gone. Look for her. - It was Alfredo's waltz. - Lili! He made his swing to that waltz. I cant stay here, Matt, I just cant do it. Dance to it, Lli. Dance! It's just and old waltz, just and old piece of music. God forgive me, but I still love you, Matt. It's nothing to be ashamed of, then or now. It's all right. Why, that's Matt with Margot! Why, that fat-head dancing. Hey, maybe we could rent him our place behind the calliope, eh? - He knows. Oh, no, no, no. - Oh, no, no, no. Honey, have you told Matt? Not exactly, but I hinted about it. Church, white veil, orange blossoms and those all omens. But, did you happen to mention me? You know, in a generalway. I have a feeling that he didn't know what you were talking about. He's been very busy. He doesn't concentrate. Of course, he's always been concentrating with Margot. He's concentrate in it. I'm glad he is. She's nice, very nice. - Honey, do you want me to tell him? - Oh, no. If we're gonna get married Sunday, somebody's got to... - No, I want to tell him. - Well, there he is now. Go tell him! - Hello, boss. - Hello, Goliath. You, winning? Oh, well...Not now. It looks he's in good mood. He's laughing. No, I've have to get dressed. I'll tell him later. - When, later? - Just later. Just later! May I come in? Yes, I wish you would. Oh, lilac! How beautiful. I know who they're from, Matt. Lilac are good luck. I hope so. Oh, beautiful! All right. Could I have it quiet, please? Everybody here? Where's Toni? And Tojo? Where is he? I'll get them in. Well, box it's finally here. It's a half hour to dress rehearsal. No breaks and no waits. I want the same performance you're gonna give tonight. So, check your costumes and your props - and pick up those music cues. - Yes, sir. Now, are there any questions? All right. When I blow this whistle for the Grand Parade, you're all on your own. You're a fine group of artists, the best in the world. And I don't want you to forget that for a minute. And also, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for the hard work that's made this circus possible. So, break a leg, let's get to it! I'm trying to get up enough nerve to tell Matt that I'm getting married. It's not that I'm afraid, but, well, I m all he has. He doesn't have a family or anyone like that. And, he'll be alone when I get married. Not really alone, but you know, it won't be the same. Even if I'm still on the show. You see what I mean? I understand, of course. Matt is very good. Kind and sweet. And if he's short of loud sometimes, it's just because he's full of fun and he loves life. There've been a lot of women after him for years but, none of them were right for him, I guess. I think you are right, I mean. You do like him, don't you? What's the matter? Thirty minutes. Hey! You better get dressed or Matt will put you back on the Stage Coach. I'm going. Think about what I said. I will. What was that all about? She was trying to match me with Matt. You know, Lili. You and Matt are digging an awfully deep hole yourselves. Why can't the keep on cue? Last time it took them four minutes to make that. Are your working here? Get into your costume! - Where was I? - Four minutes! Take two out of it. Hi! I think we'd better work those ponies in Number Three Ring. They're a little nervous working around the kid. - Right. Look at that! Look at that! Is that my mother? Answer me, is she my mother? Yes, Toni. And this says my father killed himself. He dived from the high trapeze and left a note about my mother and another man. Is that true? Is it true? It's true. You didn't tell me any of this. Why? Tell me why! I'm the other man, Toni. It was me. You? Oh! If you told her that much, why didn't you tell her the rest of it? Why didn't tell about her father and how loyal Lili really was? What good would that have done? You, you sneak back and think you can make me love you. - I only meant... - You thought you'd trick me! But you didn't trick me, you see! I know, I know everything. -I know what you are and what he is. -Toni! Toni, we only wanted... - You wanted Matt again, to roll around in filth with him again! -Toni! Well, here he is! Take him! Take him, made love to him! - Crawl on him! - That's enough! It's not enough! You liars! You killed, you killed my father! It would only be enough if I kill both of you! Toni, grow up! Be a woman. Go to Steve! You wanted to marry him. Go with him. Make a life on your own! I hope it's a better one than Lili's had. I hope she has no life at all! Not now, not ever! Lili. Lili. We both said we could take it, remember? The rehearsal. I'll be there. Be gentle. So just pack up and let's get out of here. - What else could I do? - You could use a little understand or realize that whoever planned stop in here was doing everything in his power to make their love look dirty. And I just don't believe it. But, you've known Matt longer than I have. I've only known him for ten years. That's Parade Call. You want to get ready? No! All right. Ladies and gentlemen, we bring you our Circus! Maestro! Fire! Fire! - Gimme your knife. - Matt, you can't do... I'm not gonna lose another damn tent! Get those animals outta here! Lili! Lili! That part's gone, is out of control. We gotta make a fire break to save any of this tent. - Drop the canvas between two and three poles. - Right. I'll flatten these seats. - Matt! - Oh, honey. Steve, give Cap a hand with that fire break. Get Toni out of here! Go on! - Ready? - Ready. Get the quarter poles! What do you have to do? I have to cut the lacing on poles two and three. I can do that. Hey Cap, what can I do? Cut down those lights. Lili! Lili! Get out of here! Get back! Gimme a hand. Help them with that canvas. Steve! Cut it and get out there! Thanks. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. You know something? You've got a dirty face. -Matt! It started in the wardrobe caravan. - Yeah. Well, we got a piece of tent, a whole show and half an idea and if it works out this Circus goes on... tonight! - Tonight? Are you out of your mind? - Let me see that. - Let the doctor take a look at it. - A show with this? Come on! Let's check the damage. - Hello, boss. - Hello, Goliath. Ladies and gentlemen! Your attention, please! It is my privilege to present to you... It's a remarkable thing, Matt. I hope I don't fail you. You couldn't. Toni, give her some of those owl feathers. - I haven't got any. - You haven't? You! Well, how do you think I got this big top up? Break a leg! ...Lili and her daughter Toni. - Lili's getting tired! - She won't quit. Something's happened. Toni's quit! Nothing's happened. She knows what she's doing. A wonderful kid. Lili! Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three, seventy-four, seventy-five, seventy-six, seventy-seven, seventy-eight, seventy-nine, eighty, eighty-one, eighty-two, eighty-three, eighty-four, eighty-five, eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eigthy-nine, ninety, ninety-one, ninety-two, ninety-three, ninety-four, ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, A hundred! Hey, partner! Come here!
