Instead of me and Nikola ... Two other bombers ... Let me go the other way. Why are you looking at me, guys. We'll see each other again. Can I go alone? - You can. -Of course I can. We'll be sorry if we don't see ach other again. That depends on you. If you are careful. Comrade, do you know Kovac? A dry, tall bomber? Are you Djoko? - I am. Get away from me. - Why, comrade? It's like I don't know who you are. Kovac spoke to me about you. Kovac is crazy. - I know he's crazy. But he says that you are so much more crazy. And that the hospital is lucky that he was injured and not you. Where is he? - There. That little house? - Yes there. Kovac, you picture, how good you look. You think I could come here, too? Doctor, I'm even worse today. What did you say? - You're not a doctor? I don't remember anything. I was shot in the head and I lost my memory. Has it come this far? - It says my name there. Even the doctor knows. Kovac, I know that name. Look there. What's my name? - Kovac. Is that a first or last name? - Both. This means, that I lost something. Come closer. -What is it? - Come closer. You hear? -What? - Buzzing. - Yeah. The bullet did not find its way out. It's looking for whether it will come out here or there. You really no longer need help. Maybe you'll still live a few days, but I don't have time to wait for you to die. Goodbye. You were a brave bomber and a good friend. I have to go. - Where? Give me a minute of silence. Glory to you. You don't care but I have to do an important task. They want two brave bombers. - You and me, of course. Who, you and me? - Djoko and Kovac. Kovac is gone. He's written off. - I feel good. You lost your memory. - They want to chase me off all the time. The nurses complain that I'm touching them. As far as I'm concerned, I would already take you with me. But? - But they say you're afraid of bunkers. Who says that? If it wasn't a hospital, we would have seen. Will you take me with you if I tell you something? - It depends. I thought about you. -How? - I found your shoes. Really. -Where? - There, behind the curtain. -Go on. Just go. Come on, it's over. What are you doing, comrade? - No, no, you're lying down. Don't take off my shoes, I'm not dead. You? You're about to die. You no longer need them. You'll be dead in no later than half and hour. Look at you. I don't look so bad. -Even better buried. Doctor, the wounded are coming. - How many are there? - Fourteen. Have them ready for surgery. Do we have anything for anesthesia? The farmers brought brandy. Give it to the wounded, to get drunk. Are you really a doctor? - I am. - You're not dying? -No. I'm just very tired. - Then take off your shoes. And who are you? - I'm Djoko. Did he send you, Kovac? - He did, Doctor. He made it out this time, too. - Was the wound severe? As for whom. It would be mortal for someone. For Kovac, though, it was just a hole in the head. Doctor, you got any socks? -No. Do you have any shoes for me? - Size? -46. -No. There are no benefits for me today. Do you have a bomb? - I do. Has Kovac been crazy from before or is it from a bomb? He's been like this since childhood. You did a good job. You don't look too much better. Same example as Kovac. There's no cure for it. I'm up here. Take it easy. Drink, comrade. Why don't I get hurt so I could get drunk for once. I missed you the most when they operated on me. Did you sing too? - Initially, I wanted to. But it ended with me nodding to the doctor's nurse. Hi, Comrade nurse. -Hello. I'm giving you this, Marija. - Are you leaving? I'm going to change therapy. - Kovac, let's go. Kovac, I lost my opanko. - Wait, I'll find it. Is this it? - It is. -Here you go. What will you do without it now? - At least I know I don't have one. You want a piece of bandage to wrap around your foot? -There's no need. What will you do with the other one? -I'm going to move it with my foot. If so, let's go down. But what if the Germans come? - Nothing, we'll get out of here. You're right. It's our country. Wherever we go. How are your feet? - Good. Sehr gut. We're on our way. - I'm not going after the other. If we don't get back, we'll have to go through. Maybe Peter and Nikola Should do that, too. I'm going. - No, I'm going. - How are you going to go with those feet on these stones? - I'm getting angrier from the pain. I'm losing the rhythm of fighting. You have three fights more. I'm going. You look out for your fellow machine gunner. Brigade, on the run! Stop yelling at brigades, rushing. - Why? That scares the Germans. But I relax, because they think there are many of us. Someday I will pay for this tactic with my head. Let me help you. Hello, Sir. Have you seen us. - I did. And you are not surprised? - I'm not surprised at all. You're not sure why we're walking through German territory. Everyone is crazy in their own way. - He's right to wonder. It's Yugoslavia. We're walking our way. That's what I meant. What was that shooting? We destroyed the bunker. - Here are as many as you want. Who are you for, for them or for us? -Us. I asked you for whom. - You know. What do you know? - Everything. Will you demolish the track? - Why are you interested? I would no longer work today. - We won't. We fight differently. We're all bombers. - We're looking for Germans. Here are as many as you want. - We're looking for the tall ones. The kind with big feet. - They can be like that. I'm surprised there are none here. - With such a foot? With such a foot. - Size 46? - Size 46. What size are you wearing? - What about you? -Yes, 46. Too bad I wear smaller ones. If I had bigger ones, would you give them to me? - No, you would take them from me. Such is the army. - You're wrong, we're the people's army. That's right. - What exactly? - That. We had a really nice chat. Can you give me a little more? Cheers. Cheers. Thank you. - Sir, it's for wounds. If the Germans come, just tell them that Djoko and Kovac passed by here. Are you really not going to break the tracks? - No. - Can I work? -Yes. Are you any better? - I am. Have some more? - No, we're not wasting time. When do we have to get to the task? - By morning. - Okay, let's go. You go down that track, I'm going after another. Which one? - Well, it'll be better for your foot. Kovac, is there buzzing in your head? - Buzzing like a telegraph. Where are you going? - Aren't we going to attack? You throw bombs from one side, I'll take the bombs from the other. Don't go crazy. Let's wait for darkness. - Anyone can attack in the dark. We're attacking at noon. Tighten my bandage. Does it hurt? - Wait. Sew me a five-point. I'm a proletarian, let him see. How is it? - It's the most accurate, but good. You were moving a little. It fits you nicely. It doesn't matter how it fits. What matters is who wears it. How many do you think? - About five, or six. We've already demolished such bunkers. What if you pulled them out? - Why? - To count them. Hold on. From here, I could win the war in three days. Are there any socks? There's nothing here. How is it? - I've got bigger feet than all these Germans. Pull it. - Your's not good? - They are, but these are better. After the war, I'll open shoemaking for big feet. It's worse if your head hurts. - I'm just sleepy. We have enough time, you can fall asleep. We have to be there in time. - Let's just go out. Hold on. It's good to sleep outside. It's cold in the morning. Good night. Good night and sleep tight. I'll watch. Kovac, look. - Germans. What is it? They quickly stopped. - That's not good. -Why? Because only the Germans are shooting. They recognized everyone. - We couldn't help them here. Fuck the Greek, I know that's not how history works. I think we should send two others on this mission. Comrade, we are yours. Machine gun, bunker ... - Anyone else alive? Where's the machine gun? At the end of the wall, in front of the wire. Pick her up. We'll cross the river. That's ours. Don't worry. We'll get you a stretcher. We didn't ask for her name. Who knows where she is from. We can't leave her here. Stop! Don't move. Hello, Comrade. What of the other ten? All of them. How are they? What did you expect? No one looks much better. These are Djoko and Kovac. Manual artillery. - A machine gun. Where did you come from? - I lead bombers. Obviously something big is being prepared if they gathered us. At dawn, we attack bunkers along the line. We must succeed. There is no other way. We're here. - We can go immediately if needed. Do we have enough time to sing something? -Yes. Where is Bo?o Lepilo? - He died last night. How many of us are there? - Twelve. - Enough. -No. Where? At the bunker along the line? - Yes. Just past the bunker along the line people can cross the river. But these bunkers are blocking the way. - How many are there? three, with two small ones near the bridge. They control all the surroundings. The little two are gone. - How come? We went there. Kovac will be the first to attack tonight. When you hear our bombs, you attack, too. These are the shoes you took off a prisoner, destroyed? I'm not lucky to run into any again. Comrade, are you coming with us too? Come here. Do you have any bandages. -I do. Let me take the star off. - I'll give you a nicer one. No, I'm not one of those who changes their hat after they fight. Tighten it as tight as possible. Any of you have big shoes for our bomber? -Yes. What are you going to wear? - I've got old ones in my bag. The main thing is to cross the line. - Thank you. - Wear them well. What's your name. - Ranka, what about you? - Kovac. Is that a first or last name? - Both. I'm a bomber by profession. A soft heart. How do you destroy bunkers? - Easy. Djoko shoots, I throw the bomb through the opening. But I've never seen that. - Come closer. You hear that? -What? Hold on. I also have socks for you. It started well. Djoko wore them. We will fight now. I can't die tonight. - What's the matter with you? It would be a shame to not be proud of his shoes. Which way will we go? - The same as you before us. Let's go. There's a machine gun somewhere. Where's the machine gun? At the end of the wall, it was supposed to be in front of the wire. Which wall? - How do I know? Are you crazy? Are they dead already? -Those two won't die in silence. Djoko! Djoko! Kovac! Djoko! Djoko! Come on, faster! We must demolish the bunker as soon as possible. Have you seen Djoko? -No. - Where's Mitraljezec? Djoko! Have you seen Djoko? Kovac, you're injured. - I'm not. This is the blood of the dead I was laying with. You're injured, you're bleeding. -When did you come back from the river? You didn't even tell me a name. - Stretcher! Quick! Djoko, it's buzzing in my head again. Stop! - Are you crazy? If I stop, it will not go on. Djoko, is that you? - Kovac! You're alive! - I'm alive! Where did you get lost that night? - I got hit in the head. You? Me? I was hunting Germans from the bunker. I saw one with big feet, I wanted to take them. Then I got lost. - You've got new shoes. How good you look. - It's a people's authority. We are chasing a counter-revolution. - I thought you were a mailman. What kind of mailman? Those buzzers again? - Don't buzz me anymore. Shall we toast? Cheers! I'm going home, Kovac! We're going home together, Djoko! - We're going home! We'll be lucky if we're able to get on the train. We have to make it, even if it takes standing on one leg. I have to call the station tomorrow. - We're going upstairs. You volunteer to go to war, you fight but you can't go home. Why are you yell at me, it's not my fault. -You. You're in authority. I am the authority, but there are no privileges. We didn't fight for it. Did we fight to take a break on the trains? The bandit, however, drives away in the cabin. -Excellent. Isn't this great? He drive as if he won the war, not us. According to the regulations, the captive must be taken in a compartment. Djoko, can you arrest someone? - Can't I? What is this? You would ride in a cain too. -Can I? According to the regulations it should take the prisoner in a compartment. But we have to act like we don't know each other. I can tell you are dangerous. - Do you think I'm dangerous? Of course. If I lead you, you have to seem dangerous. But what if the controller comes? - Leave it to me. Djoko, can I be a spy? - You'll have a hard time with that nose. I'm already so capable of everything, what if I were beautiful? What's happening? - Bandits are messing around here. What happened? - Bandits. The soldiers killed one. Will we? -What? - Will we be comfortable? No. -What now? - That would be abuse of office. Do you think I want handcuffs? I'm a fighter. But I haven't really slept in three years. What do you think? - The shoe is bugging me. Come here, you're under arrest. I have to lock you in to keep us separate. -Not yet. Can you? - What are you waiting for? I don't know yet, you're my first. - Let me. Luckily I got handcuffs. Others bind with a wire. Slow. There will be nothing. The thing's gone down. - Milicnik! Stop! Here you go. - Well done. -Come on! Slow down where you go. - Stand back! Don't touch him! Let him go! Stop it! These are good and smart people. You're a bandit for them. Right, buddy? Is he gone? -Yes. If I didn't, you would certainly not drive in a cabin. I'm important. You'd be standing on one leg right now. Is there a problem? -No. - If there is, call. What are you getting into, I have my guard! What if you beat him. No one will hear. He can also sing. - It wouldn't be bad, I was thinking about it myself but this is forbidden. Wait, don't hit too hard, I have to take him to court. He must not lose his memory. - If you want. I would. I'll call you if it's necessary. - You entertained him. This one would beat me. - If you want to take off the cuffs, I'll give you the key, but I won't take responsiblity. The door can't be locked, they can come any minute. I'll watch the key. - This is not by regulation. But I can give it to you, if he wants to beat you. You want him to throw us out? - I'm not afraid of him, but I wouldn't stay up all night outside in that crowd. I have to go to the toilet. I can't stand it anymore. What will you be there for? -What's up? I have to pee. To pee? I though you wanted to run away. Have you ever been injured since last time we saw each other? I was, twice. Both times abnormal. What are you looking at? - This is where the most courageous pee. Only men pissd here before the war. Workers, students and farmers had to endure, waiting until they were at home. But if it was urgent, as is now, they went out the window. You see what I let you do. But if you try to run away, I'll kill you. - No kidding. - I'm not. I'll kill you. You're crazy. Why would you kill me? - For trying to escape. I know how you do it, bandits. To the toilet and out the window. Hold on. You see how you are. What about me? -I'm sorry. Remember Marija? Where are you going? - Ah, you're here. Don't worry, he's fine. It's from a drink. Come on out! Put that hat on. The pee was scared out of him. - Will we miss him? -What? Heat. -No. I'll call you if necessary. As you want. I would. Comrade, the cabin is occipied. - I didn't know. Excuse me. I saw a vacancy. - But you can stay. Sorry, you can't sit in a cabin with a bandit. If he wasn't like that, I would soon touch her. What touch? This girl was decent. Maybe I had decent intentions. I'm an adult. I was at war. I wanted to make kids. Kovac, who will be their godfather? - You, stupid. You musn't drink. -Why, I'm not driving the locomotive. You're a bandit. - I can handle that too. How did you survive? - Easy. I've never been mortally wounded. I thought about that night when we separated. The other three of us. You were the fourth. I thought you were dead. I was looking for you among the dead. I was among them, but alive. I was looking for you too. You're a bandit. Just get started. Just enough to start the melody. Have you started yet? Are you kidding me? - I already beat him. Eh, you didn't call me. Hey, he's gone. - This one's even crazier than you. There was one in my company even more crazy, but I thought that he is dead. What is it? - How many times have you been injured? Twice. In the neck and in the head. The scar is still visible. You know what. Unlock me. That fool can come anytime and beat me. Before explaining to him, who and what I am, and that I have three medals, the train will be gone. I'll stand on the platform. If I need to, I'll go to another train. I've had enough time. I'm in no hurry. If so many days have passed, one day he will not know himself. Not applicable. You will go with this train. I'm not getting out of this cabin. Good night. Djoko, what sizes shoes do you wear?. -46. What if I wore 49. Good night. Comrade, take a rest. Sit down. Thank you. And you? - I'm used to the situation. Want a smoke? - I don't smoke. I only smoke when I'm hungry. I have a daughter your age. And my son died. A fighter. The girl followed me. Where we are? - At Mokra Gora. How much longer? - Two hours. I have to take the cuff off. My hand fell asleep. Better not. That fool could come at any moment. Why are you sleeping? I have to. The time passes faster. I'll never get used to the war being over. But I don't remember when did it began.
