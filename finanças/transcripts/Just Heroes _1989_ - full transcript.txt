Good morning, Mr Ma Good morning What a surprise. Tai Gor Stealing my boat for smuggling? Just borrowing it. You make good money? Just small change. Just over one million What does this mean to your company Actually If you needed money, you could have come to me. Money is no problem. But You smuggled arms from The Philippines, and killed some guys Now Interpol are involved. They've found out that is my boat. Now they're investigating our company What can I do about it? Mr Ma, What do you expect Now you want to get away. Okay Give yourself up to the police... Bullshit! Then we'll settle it our way! It's all set. It's yours Take it! Take it! Go Mr Ma go away Tai Gor, he is dead. Just making sure... Why're you here, Sou If you're in danger, I'm there. Good! Maybe I'm too pessimistic but time passes, and the killing never stops.

Jacky conspiring with outsiders. No?! Will not? When uncle was murdered, Who was out celebrating? Shut Up. Mr Ma Sit down. I will definitely investigate Mr Tsou did choose If he died someone to take his place. In case Mr Wong witnessed it. Sou Mr Tsou wanted you to take his position. Sou Now the organization is yours. Mr Tsou really cares about you. He thought much of you. He never talk about it that you were adopted. Mr Tsou had sharp eyes! Congratulations. Now we are family. Should consider the whole thing. You're the most experienced man here He still has a lot to learn from you. I'll help you if you need anything in the future Sou Gor You rest first. Mr ma said let us take care of you Yes After Mr Tsou died, everything should be more caution Don't worry I'll be okay. You can go. Just leave me alone. It's my duty to protect you. I think we should separate. Why? I wanted to live a peaceful life with you But now... I'm in a position I don't want to be in. I can't find a way out. Uncle death came too soon Something could happen to me And happen to you too. Don't take the business if you don't want it. I owe him too much I must repay that debt. I've got a plan So you don't have to worry. I did this... I don't want to part. Even if you were the worst man in the world I would not leave. You'll regret it. No I won't He won't either. Really?

No Maybe he's hiding... or he's been Killed. Don't trust anyone, even those close to you. Everything must be careful. Sometimes things are not as they seem. Truth and lies blur together.

I know I'm always wrong no matter I take responsibility for it. - Tai Gor - Sou It was my fault tonight. I should be responsible! I'm not blaming Tai But you need to cover yourself. Let someone else take the blame. Tai Gor I've been looking for you. Why did it go wrong? I'm Sorry Tai Gor. But the plan was perfect. I stirred up trouble between them. I made them fight each other, and informed Officer Lee. Even if Sou is innocent, he deserves to die. Then you can take over. I don't like this! Whatever Sou did, we deal with it ourselves We don't involve the police. I never imagined you'd go to the site. I've got you into trouble. Jacky Out of everyone in the organization Only you are on my side. You will replace me from tomorrow Take good care of the company What are you going to do? Somebody must take responsibility for this mess. I'll surrender to the police, for the sake of the organization. Tai Gor What are you doing? It's my fault, so I'll take the blame. Give me the gun!

I understand But we never kill police Now the police are angry They won't just drop the matter. I discussed with Mr Wong. Sou can manage the company alone. Tai You'd better take a holiday.

Call the ambulance Sing Fai Sing Fai Sing Fai Why did you do it? Why Sing Fai attempted suicide. Her heart has always remained with you. I know you dislike me but we're still brothers. Uncle cold in the grave, I have never found a murderer Sometimes I feel I am useless This world is really unfair Able men always lack chances but fate favours the incompetent. Listen to this tape It proves Sou is the assassin. I don't want to believe it's true. Uncle Tsou brought us up. We have to pay back the debt. Hey guy, Hurry up!

I can't tell you Sou Gor is killing me Let me ask you Did you do it? "Yes" or "No" does it matter? The truth will never be found out Mr Tsou is dead. Sooner or later I'll join him. But now I know what I must do. You said before that you'd left the circle. Why are you still here? Why? To find out one thing Whether I've misjudged a friend. Don't talk too long. Jacky Mr Wong How is it here? Okay Not so bad It's safe at least until now. He hasn't tried anything yet. Who? Is your best brother Siu Who plotted with Wah Gor to kill Mr Tsou. It's all his work Bastard I'm waiting now, as soon as I find a chance I will never let him go Jacky What you heard may not be true. Even if Ash is really this kind of person Then he will die sooner or later We love and care about you. You have a bright future. Just don't want to miss your talent Why do you still trust him? I don't understand. In order to find out the murderer, Tai Gor became insecure It Is a waste. Aren't you regret? Why should I regret? You did being used No, I'm not. I've always been a man who did the right thing. I still know what loyalty Loyalty Sometimes we have to divide the boundaries You're being used and it's tragic. Enough! I don't feel hard done by. A traitor is tragic Jacky Take care of yourself. I will I'll survive. Wait for Tai Gor to be the boss The day will come You still think Sou did that? Why are you here? It is shame to me All I want is revenge for uncle Tsou But no one understands. They suspect me of treachery. They want me to disappear. Don't stop me! - Leave me. - Stay clam I've lost everything now. Don't say that. I'll help you Too late When Fai the truth is known We'll be unable to bear it and prefer to die. Sing Fai Don't... Sing Fai Sing Fai Tai I'm Sorry. No need to say sorry You weren't to blame. The doctor said, I can never have another baby. It doesn't matter... You and I that's enough. We'd better get married. Better like this. That's good If I'm not married, I can have more girlfriends. You dare! Okay, I promise you. But don't spend too much money on them. Wai Gor Let me go with you tonight. No need.

We're all sorry about Sing Fai... I shouldn't have come... Do you mind? Come on We're all brothers. Come Sou Tai is here Congratulations Thank you Tai Gor. Congratulations Sou Great! I always hoped that you two would be together. I'm glad you're here. I had to come. Come on You both come here and cheers. Wai to you with respect. To uncle... with respect.

It's lucky I got here in time. You allow me to follow you? Shut up! Why are you here? Wai Gor I know I'm useless, but I did good this time. I've dreamed of following you. I am proud. I was always in the pond... Listen to me... You don't know all the things. The circle isn't for you. Get out now. I can help you, Wai Gor. Trust me. Go home! Wai Gor. Tai Gor. When will you send me to US? Is everything alright? Almost. And you. Good morning, Sir Jacky Gor We heard the news. All of the people like you Not at all Have one. Let's have a talk there What for? What's up, friend? Tai Gor says hello You're lying! Tai Gor will not do this to me. Tai Gor. Mr Ma isn't here. Tai Gor You made it. Of course, Nobody can stop me. You are old. You always looked down on me. Mr Tsou made a mistake When he took you as his son. No more bullshit, give me the testament. I want to know Who he chose as the new boss. I'm afraid it's too much for you to take. You never suspected that it was Wai. Wai had left, I chose Sou. Wail was to become head, and turn us into a legitimate business. He will be a good leader Mr Tsou knew you'd be a disaster. Shit! You think you can quit just like that? Now I'm leader. I'll paint the word "Loyalty" on the walls in gold. Now that I'm in charge who would dare call me traitor? Even if hadn't killed Uncle Tsou, he'd have retired. But I've grasped power I'm the leader! I should be the boss. If I want someone dead, he's a dead man! Don't move! Now it's you. I'll finish you off as well. Sing Fai is so pitiful. She understood before she died. Mr Tsou murder is Tai work. I misjudged him. She is so pitiful. She didn't live to see me become boss. She can't see this I never understood what she needed... Put down the gun. I can't die But it's damn painful. I know it must hurt. - It is pain. - You are shot. You faked your death! Sou Gor Tai Gor Cover them It's just like "A Better Tomorrow" Flower pots... I can copy the movie. Flower pots are here Ready! Sou Tai Gor Wai Gor Remember "A Better Tomorrow"! Uncle Ma! Sou, are you okay? Go Run Wai. You are good Why are you here? I come to help you Go Mr Ma Mr Ma are you okay? I am ok. Kill them all. You go first. Wai Gor, here is a gun. Go away You are bleeding. Go away. Stay calm, I am coming to help I will shoot you now. Go, Mr Wong Sou Wai Gor There is a gun under the table. Behind the vase as well. Behind the flower pot. No bullets. Where are you going? Move now. There should be a gun with bullet here. - Wai Gor. - Catch it. Wai Shoot... Shoot. What's the matter, no guts? You can kill me It doesn't mean you're the good guys. We are all rubbish. Rubbish. You don't dare So put down your guns. Drop them! Sou shoot him! Mr Ma I'm sorry Wai Gor Sou Gor Wicked! I've finally seen the real thing! You are great, Wai. Look at him! Do you still want to be a boss? Do you want to run a fish business?
