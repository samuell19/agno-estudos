CGV ARTHOUSE presents A BANZAKBANZAK FILM production The people’s participation in criminal trials began with the introduction of a jury system in 2008. This film is based on the first trial with a jury in Korea. Will the trial be canceled? -Good morning. -Is everything ready? -He’s here! -Let’s go! Your comments on the first trial with a jury, please? There are concerns about the jury system. Will the jury’s decision be accepted, Your Honor? Please, it’s not me. A word, please? Should the general public adjudicate? Why you... Everyone’s watching. Couldn’t you dress up for a day like this? Anyway, talk to the reporters after the jury selection, okay? Say it’s an honor to be in court with the people. Something like that. How’s the case? Looked over it? I don’t see much contention. That’s good. But you never know, sir. What do you mean? This is a great opportunity. If it wasn’t for the draw, you wouldn’t have gotten this. Why you... You have to get promoted to High Court this time. Or younger folks will come up and you’ll be left in the dust. So do a good job no matter what, okay? Supreme Court Chief Justice, sir? This is Chief Kim. She’ll head the jury trial. Kim Jun-kyeom, sir. General public taking part in trials... What a headache for the judiciary. Yes, sir. But Chief Kim has dealt with homicide cases for 18 years, sir. She’s strong and resolute like a man. I expect a positive picture. JURY SELECTION COMPLETE Those who weren’t selected, please take the $50 pay. Why weren’t you selected? Selecting jurors is hard. I’m tired already. Do I look like the chief presiding judge? Don’t leave out anything. Our chief is crazy. Right. A workaholic... She memorizes everything? Non-pre-law majors work extra hard. Come in. Juror 8 was planted by Central Daily for an exclusive. We removed him. - One juror is gone? - Yes. 7 jurors are enough for a quorum. It won’t affect the trial. Call the candidates who were absent. Let’s fill all 8 jurors. You have an hour. Yes, chief! Debtor Rehabilitation Application Stop applying. How about filing for bankruptcy? I don’t want to. If I do, I’ll have to drop my product. I just got it patented. I can’t give up now and lose everything. You’ll be rejected again anyway if you apply. Please stop coming and interfering with my work. This is the most important thing in my life, sir. Could you please take a closer look at my business plan? This is my newly patented self-defence tool. Please? Who carries this around these days? It’s needed now more than ever! This is special! See? This green button projects capsaicin! And this one? If an attacker covers your mouth, this will call for help! I see. I recorded the cry for help. Wanna hear it? Why isn’t it working? Loose wires? What about the spray? Don’t spray that at me! It doesn’t work either? Don’t point it at me! Fine. I’ll apply for you. Put that down, please. -Really? -Yes. Thank you! Excuse me. Hello? It’s Seoul Central District Court. Is this Mr. Kwon Nam-woo? You were selected as a candidate but didn’t come or submit a notice. That’s a $2000 fine. Pardon? I didn’t know our country even had jurors! We sent you a notice. I’ve been getting a lot of overdue notices... We’ll ask some questions for jury selection. If the chance of a defendant’s guilt Is 50 - 50, then is the defendant guilty or not? 50-50? Guilty? Next question. Wait! Let me think. That’s not right... I’ll ask a question. Release ten criminals if you must, but don’t sentence 1 man unjustly. Do you agree or disagree? Can’t you decide? Mr. Kwon Nam-woo? Why do you think we need the law? To punish criminals? The law does not exist to punish people. Would it be right to punish people without any standard? They could be wrongfully charged. To avoid punishing people unjustly and to set a standard, that’s the law. Next candidate? He’ll come in an hour. The defendant has acknowledged all of his crimes. So it’ll be more of a sentencing trial. So it’s decided that he’s guilty? So all you need to decide on is how many years to sentence him. ‘2008, The First Civic Participation Trial Jury’ Please stand closer together! This way. Look at the camera, please. Juror 1? This way, please. Good call. It wouldn’t look good having an empty spot from the start. Nice picture. Let’s do this right, so you can go to the High Court. And I’ll go to the Supreme Court. Ready? Everyone smile! One, two, three! Today marks the first time the public has participated as jurors in a trial. It’s a historical day where citizens, as jurors, will judge the defendant. As we begin this historical trial, there is much anticipation in the citizens’ participation. There is also concern that the trial may be non-professional. However, the court believes the jury will judge based on facts and evidence. We hope to make proper judgments by communicating with the people. We’ll abide by the law and by principles. It’s starting! Jurors! Enter! Calling Case 2008-372. The trial of Kang Du-sik, charged with homicide, will commence. TRIAL COMMENCEMENT AT 11:08 a.m. Around 2 a.m. on July 29th, 2008, at his home in unit 902 Dong-hwa Apartment, Joong-gu Seoul, defendant Kang Du-sik fought with his mother, Cho Bok-lae, over money. He lost his temper and planned to murder his mother. He struck her with a blunt instrument around 4 a.m. Then he dropped her from the balcony to make it look like an accident. No surveillance cams! He can’t be far! Found him! Why you! Hold him! He must’ve fallen down the stairs while running away. He woke up 3 days later after brain hemorrhage surgery. WITNESS: DETECTIVE JUNG YONG-DEOK He eventually confessed. She always nagged about money... So you got mad and pushed her off the balcony? Was it really an accident? Huh? You’re not lying, right? The defendant got severe burns on his face and arms at age five. Because she had to leave her young son alone to go and work, she locked the door from the outside, so he couldn’t escape the fire sooner. Out of resentment and struggling with money, he violated moral laws. However, he confessed his sins and is repentant. Honorable judges and members of the jury, though his crime may be deplorable, please note it was an accidental death during a heated argument. May I interrupt? The victim was 157cm tall, correct? And the railing was 120cm high? That means it came up to her chest. Isn’t it too high for her to be simply pushed and fall? Is it really possible for this to be accidental? Ah... well... Prosecution? She was hanging still as if she was already dead. When he let go, she dropped still like a mannequin. APARTMENT SECURITY GUARD The defendant killed her with a hammer. Then he ran to get his prosthetic gloves that fell off. He used the stairs to avoid CCTV cameras. He even called 911 to report it as an accident. 911 emergency. Hello? How may I help you? Someone fell... Really, sir? Where is that? Sir? The location, please? Why did the defendant plan the murder? Look! See this? Stop! Look! SERVICE CENTER, DAY OF ACCDIENT See the back support? She threw out her back! She can’t work! Let’s just go. Mom! Let’s go! Please fill out these forms separately. Then you can receive basic living subsidy. STATEMENT OF FAMILY DISOWNMENT Let’s go. No! Du-shik! Let’s go! -Should I fill it out for you? -Let’s just go! What the! SERVICE CENTER EMPLOYEE If any member of the family works, they can’t get basic living subsidy? Yes. That’s the law. I explained that to him several times. But his mother washed dishes at a restaurant. When she couldn’t work for months, he came in drunk and yelled. He came to apply for subsidy because his mother couldn’t work? Yes. But a temporary injury doesn’t suffice. It has to be a severe disability. That’s the law, but he took it out on me. As the defendant couldn’t work, he urgently needed the $700 subsidy rather than his mother’s unstable pay. This is the family disownment form found at the scene. The parent and the dependent must both declare disownment. Both are needed to show an agreement has been made. Only one, written by the defendant, was found at the scene. He demanded that his mother write the form, too. But when she refused, he killed her mercilessly. Read it, please? Pardon? Me? “I’ll cut ties with my mother.” “My life is ruined because of her.” “It’s her fault I’m covered in burns.” “It’s her fault I couldn’t get jobs.” “It’s all because of my terrible mother.” You said to write it! You fools said to write it! Quiet, please! Defendant. Do you wish to speak further? Please be seated. Sit down, please. I... don’t remember... I don’t remember. Sit down, please. I said I don’t remember! I don’t remember! I don’t remember anything! Defendant! I don’t know! Calm down! Court will adjourn. -Let go! -Calm down! -What’s with you? -Calm down! It just so happens he can’t recall the night she died. He refused the lie detector. He confessed! Why change things all of a sudden? Let’s wrap it up and do the trial next time. But Kang wants the trial and denies all the charges. Ow! So we must debate if he’s guilty or not? What in the world? The reporters are coming. Let’s go to the meeting room. The evidence is clear. What’s there to worry about? There is. The jury. -You’re a law school student? -Yes. So what happens now? But I’m in my first year... You look old to be in your first year. -Be quiet. -What happened? What do you think will happen? If the defendant claims he can’t remember... Then we judge if he’s guilty or not. Ow... My stomach. Why? He killed his mother. He’s lying that he doesn’t remember. He confessed. Why change now? How can we believe him? This is worse than kids’ cafeteria food. What do you expect? We get $100 a day here. So I’m not working hard. No. Maybe he really can’t remember. When my husband had a stroke, he only lost memory of the day he fell. Juror 8? What do you think? Me? Ah... I have no idea. Why is this here? Excuse me? I’m so sorry. May I go to the Civil Appeals Department? I just have to submit this. Outside contact is forbidden. -Then may I make... -That’s better! May I make a phone... Just one phone call, please? Did you see the judge when the defendant acted up? She didn’t even blink. I didn’t do anything wrong, but she scared me. I guess not everyone can be a judge, huh? Why can’t my daughter want to be a judge? Not a K-pop idol... Not all judges are the same. Without connections and patrons, she’s just another civil servant. The chief judge is like that. Who are you? How do you know that? Sorry. Excuse me. It’s good to know, isn’t it? She’s our boss today. Still, it must be nice to be a judge. It’s a government job. We’ll be done before 6 p.m., right? It could be 6 p.m. today or tomorrow. Who knows? What? Juror 5? Yes! Yes, sir. It’s me, sir. -Wait! -He made arrangements from before. He’s the chief secretary of Samjin Group. But... -That’s why he seemed so smart. -I’ve been selected as a juror, sir. It’s like reserve duty training. I apologize, sir. You arrive at 11 p.m., sir. I’ll be sure to meet you at the airport. Wanna run away? Pardon? Shaking your legs means you want to leave. Go if you have to. They let us go to the bathroom. If he’s denying it after everything, it means he hopes to get to to the jury, no? The defendant is denying the charges... We’ll have to accept it. So I have to argue that he’s not guilty now? All of a sudden? He’s aware that he could be sentenced longer than a plead for mercy? The defendant is not the problem! Think of the jury! They’re common citizens with no knowledge of the law. Let them judge if he’s guilty or not? That’s like giving scalpels to visitors and letting them perform surgeries! If the jury makes the wrong decision, the picture is ruined! Can you handle that? This isn’t just about our court. The judiciary’s honor is on the line. Let’s cancel and do it next time. Agreed? From juvenile detention to five accounts of violence, and lots of trial experience? Let’s keep going. Let’s proceed to see if he’s guilty or not. But... Let’s eat quickly and work! He’s missing! ‘Civil Appeals Department’. But I went that way. What? Damn! Where is it? Excuse me! Civil Appeals Department... Where is it? Ordinary people can’t be here. I’m ordinary... Only judges use this path. The public and judges have different paths. Don’t look. Judges get scared if strangers look at them. Why? They think they came for revenge. Damn judges. Let’s go. It’s a maze in here. A maze is a way, too. That’s weird. Wait. It’s locked. Stay right here. Pardon? Don’t move. Stay here. I’ll be back. But... A man in his late 20s. He’s average looking. -His hair is average length. -My stomach! He’s pretty tall. Do you have his picture? No..? He didn’t go to the bathroom. He ran away. Some nerve... He must have a screw loose. Or else, why would he escape here? Now, we have to always move in a set. A set? What are we a dish? Quiet please. -This is like prison. -I heard that. It’s coming out! Wait out here, please. Do it with the door closed. Where is that guy?! Call me when the trial date is set. Excuse me. The card... I mean... Civil App... Stay back, please! Stay back! Security! Intruder! Where’d it go? Well... They said not to meet outsiders, but I guess you’re not... Hello. Could you pass me that? Help! Somebody help me! Thank you. -What if I did it... -Pardon? Do you know him? No. I heard he killed his mother. I see. But he said he didn’t do it. Who knows? There could be more to the story. A trial isn’t over till it’s over. What? How did this... Ma’am? CIVIL APPEALS DEPARTMENT We won’t tolerate actions that undermine the trial’s impartiality. You’ll all be jointly responsible for all incidents that arise here. Is that clear? If you do that again, I’ll... He says he went to the bathroom and got lost! It’s only right to welcome back the lost, you know? Why you! Yes. This judge must’ve scared you. As you know, the defendant denies the crime now. Now, it will be a trial to determine if he’s guilty or not. Wait a minute. Then will the trial take longer? We’ll know as we go. Members of the jury, please remember to presume innocence and don’t conclude the defendant is guilty till the end. Juror 8? Do you understand? Yes. The victim’s time of death is estimated to be 4 a.m. on July 29th. FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST An autopsy conducted on July 31st showed fractures in the head and cervical vertebrae. It doesn’t look like death from a simple fall. In examining deaths from falls, we check for possibility of being thrown down post mortem. We only found vital reactions on the posterior head. The size of the depression and wound indicates she was hit with a hammer. This wound is the direct cause of the victim’s death. A juror may not speak in court. Write your comments or questions and hand them to us, please. Forensic doctor is wrong. The jury may find it difficult to understand. To summarize your testimony, you mean the victim fell from the balcony after death? Yes. I believe so. That’s not a hit from a hammer! Juror 6? Please be quiet and be seated. The cut may look similar to that of a hammer. But if a person dies from a blade cut, there should be what we call scattered blood. Blood would’ve gushed up and out. But there wasn’t much blood in the pictures before. You worked as an embalmer for 30 years? People may look down on me for washing corpses, but I’m better than autopsy doctors, and cops ask me all the time. Do you have a forensics degree or doctor’s licence? Well, no... Delete Juror 6’s comments from the record. If you speak, you’ll be removed from court. Please be seated. Witness? Is it possible that the wound is not from a hammer? It’s highly unlikely. Look closely! That’s not a hammer wound! Juror 6! Your personal opinion hinders the trial’s impartiality. Please leave the court. Security? Damn it. Come out, sir. What in the world? Move over! Why can’t I say what I think? Let’s go. Let go of me! Then why bother selecting a jury! Let go! I don’t believe this! If I’m wrong, I’ll stick my fingers in dung! Can you swing a hammer without fingers? What do you mean? Well... Do you wish to speak? Can the defendant swing a hammer? Could we test and see? Did you check if the defendant can swing a hammer or not? No. He confessed to murder. Do we have to? I know how you investigate. But it’s the first trial with a jury. You should’ve paid more attention to details. Must I test this now? Why not? I’m suddenly arguing he’s not guilty. What test? Why bring things up! I vote against it. He doesn’t have fingers. If he can swing a hammer then he’s the killer. If not... He doesn’t have fingers? No fingers? Why doesn’t he have fingers? How’d you know that he’s missing fingers? Well... He has severe burns and he’s wearing gloves. Doesn’t that raise red flags? Let’s just test and see. He can’t hold a hammer if he has no fingers. He had prosthetic gloves. Can you swing wearing prosthetic gloves? He filled out a form. Why can’t he swing a hammer? Swinging and writing are different. So let’s test and see. Wait. If he can’t swing, then he’s innocent? Right. How do we know if he can’t swing or if he won’t? Let the chief judge decide. What? She’s the judge! Jury votes 4:3 in favor of the test. Very well. As the jury requests, we’ll test if the defendant can swing a hammer or not. Quiet, please! Please remove the gloves and put on the prosthetic gloves. Quiet, please! Please grab the hammer? Defendant? Swing the hammer down. Defendant? Try to swing the hammer down. You can’t do it or you won’t? Move! Step aside! Are you all right? Hurry! Will the trial be canceled? What happens to the jury? JURY ROOM Oh no! Will the judge be all right? Why bring up the test! What if we get arrested for that? What? No way. Damn joint responsibility! Why test it? If it smells like shit, it’s shit! There! Ask him. The presiding judge appeared to be bleeding badly. Even the Chief Justice went with her to the hospital. PRESIDING JUDGE INJURED FATE OF FIRST TRIAL BY JURY UNCERTAIN Our sources say that judge Kim has been treated and is stable. They’ll soon decide whether to resume the trial. How embarrassing! All this because of one juror! Forget it. Chief Kim. Let’s stop the circus and adjourn for today. Did you hear me or not? Cancel it. It’s me. What? I’m the presiding judge. Dr. Jeong? Make sure it doesn’t leave a scar. Yes, sir. Fine. Some question the court’s ability to preside a public trial by jury. Have a seat. Are you all right? I see that you’re quite particular. Thanks to your test idea, it proved he can swing. But... I’m still curious... If he swings the hammer, it’s acknowledging that he did it. If it was me, I wouldn’t have swung it. He lost it as he swung it. Maybe it means he can’t swing.... Rulings are made based on evidence. It’s a fact that the suspect can swing a hammer. Mr. Kwon? Today is a historic day of citizens judging in a trial. The results of this trial could rewrite Korea’s judicial history. But there’s growing protest to stop the trial at once. Should we end it here? I drank with my sister that night and told him to wise up. DEFENDANT’S UNCLE I said stop idling at home and do something! Then he lost his mind and attacked me. I’m lucky my sister stopped him. He almost killed me, too! I slept over at a friend’s house because grandma’s brother was coming. DEFENDANT’S DAUGHTER, KANG SO-RA Did you notice anything different between your father and grandmother? He said your father and grandmother fought often. What does he know? He hardly ever comes. What would he know? People say they fight. But they’re not really fighting! It’s because dad hates that grandma has to work so hard. My dad didn’t kill her. Can you say that before your grandmother who passed away? Why the fuck not! Moreover, the victim is his own mother. Severe punishment is warranted. PROSECUTION SEEKS DEATH PENALTY It’s not the defendant but poverty that destroyed this family. Please take it into consideration. The controversial first trial with a jury has ended after 8 hours. There is growing interest in how the jury’s verdict will affect the final decision of the judges. HAN Yeon-hee. YTN news. Guilty. DELIBERATION Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. It’s unanimous! Now, let’s vote if it was planned or accidental. Wait. There are only 6. Ah... Juror 8? Yes? You vote guilty? Or not guilty? I’m not sure. It’s either guilty or not guilty. What don’t you get? What’s with you? Motive, witness, and forensic evidence are all there. There’s no new evidence that came up in the trial. It’s an obvious case that just took longer with a jury. The jury will vote guilty, right? Of course! Let’s conclude as this. Yes, chief. Juror 8 requested to see the case records. What does he know? Show him. What do you want to know? Talk to me, pal. I’m trying to help. PETITION BY DAUGHTER NO BLOOD ON HAMMER It looks like he’s guilty, but it doesn’t feel right. May I explain things simply for you? NO SUBSIDY FAMILY DISOWNMENT WITNESS Now... If you sort out the facts, it’s not hard to see at all. He pushed her off the balcony when she wouldn’t write the disownment. That’s a fact. That alone shows he’s guilty. It’s so obvious. He killed his mother with a hammer then disguised it as death by falling. Why? She would’ve resisted from being dropped. Thus, this hammer is proof that he planned the murder. It means he’s guilty without a doubt for planning the murder. Well said! What would we have done without you? Now, will you vote? If you’re unsure, just go with the flow. That’s the way the world turns. You know? Wait. The hammer was found as evidence the day after the autopsy. Isn’t that a bit weird? No. It’s common in an investigation to find the weapon later. One date being different doesn’t change everything. At least they found the weapon. Shouldn’t we think like that? There was no blood found on the hammer! Stop thinking so hard! Of course not! He planned the murder. He probably wrapped the hammer with plastic or something. There was no blood on it? Excuse me. Head juror! Not you, too! Let’s wrap it up. Remember what the old embalmer said? It’s not a hammer wound. You believe that? But he has 30 years of experience... So what? He’s not a licenced expert. Thirty years makes him an expert. I took care of my husband for 10 years without a licence. Remember what the lawyer said? He pushed her by accident while arguing. That means... What’s the word? -He killed her accidentally? -Right! Accidentally. What if that’s how she died? Ma’am! Try taking care of an old man who can’t walk. I thought of killing him a hundred times. But I could never plan to actually do it. If there’s a possibility he didn’t hit her with a hammer, that’s invalid as evidence. It’s the first thing I learned in law school. Think of the possibility of innocence. Possibility of innocence? But I’m not saying that he’s innocent. Just that maybe it’s possible he did it accidentally. That’s what I’m saying. You heard the forensic doctor! Only the wound on the head showed a vital reaction. It means he killed her with the hammer then threw her down. What if she hit her head as she fell? What? Then she crashed to the ground... Do you have proof? There’s no proof to say she didn’t either. What? The forensic doctor said it was a hammer! Is it because he confessed? What do you mean? If there’s a confession, they slack on the investigation. It’d just be a waste of tax money. So there’s no other proof besides the forensic doctor? Are you saying that he lied? If I’m wrong, I’ll stick my fingers in dung! Maybe he doesn’t want to admit he could be wrong. JURY’S UNEXPECTEDLY LONG DELIBERATION Yes? Come in, please. Yes, chief. Wait inside, please. It’s okay. It’s cold. Please wait inside. Some of you think that he didn’t kill with a hammer? Okay, fine. Then is he not guilty? He’s guilty. Why? What? Because of many reasons like... For sure, he dropped his mom. -Yes. That. -Right. It’s a fact that Kang Du-sik killed the victim. Right? Let’s decide on that first. Is he guilty or not guilty? You really don’t know or pretending you don’t? Why look at that again? Just decide if he’s guilty or not. Whether he used a hammer or not, he dropped her from the balcony and killed her! Is that true or not? Is that true or not! I don’t want to! What? Why not? Just decide if he’s guilty or not! If I say he’s guilty, it’s over! Are you 100% sure he’s guilty? I’m not! I’m not voting until I am! Good luck. Who else can convince him but you? “I don’t want to”? What the heck? Wait! It doesn’t have to be unanimous. The judge said that. We can decide by majority. Yes, but he has to vote either way... We explained but he won’t vote. Can’t we decide democratically to withdraw his vote? I don’t think that’s right. Think about it. We’re all wasting time here. It’s not fair that our opinion is being ignored because of one man. In a democratic society, I think that’s wrong. Right. I agree with you there. Should we withdraw his vote? I’m not sure, either! I’ll cancel my guilty vote. Not you, too! The hammer is fishy. Honestly, it’s not right. Withdrawing his vote to end things quickly? It’s obvious you want to end it and go home. Young folks can be so naïve. He killed his mom and tried to kill the judge, too! Isn’t that crazy? How could he do that to the judge when his life is in her hands? Maybe because he was scared. -What if I did it... -Pardon? He got charged for killing his mom. People point fingers, but he can’t remember! In a situation like that, I think I’d be really scared. That’s true. Dogs bark because they’re scared. What are you people saying? If you’re scared, you can harm people? It’s a scary world to raise kids. Crazy people like him should be behind bars! My daughter is too scared to walk past that neighborhood! People who live there aren’t all that bad. What do you know? I lived in that apartment until three years ago. I believe what So-ra said. -Look here. -Who’s So-ra? Kang’s daughter. She wrote about trips together and how close they were. -If you see this... -You believe her? Look at her hair and clothes. You can’t judge people by their appearance, ma’am. Does she remind you of how you used to live? So you’re taking the killer’s side? Because he’s from the same poor area? Poor folks stick up for each other? What? What did I say? I think what So-ra wrote is real! Hey! Stay out. Really? Explain why. What? Well... If a statement is very detailed and specific, it’s highly possible that it’s true. I’ll read what So-ra wrote on that night. “Dad wasn’t hungry after eating five donuts, so granny ate dinner alone.” “When she ate beef with a spoonful of soy sauce,” “dad said, ‘Stop eating salty food. You have diabetes.’ ” “He nagged as usual.” “Granny said, ‘But you have too many sweets.’ ” “She smiled, took out a box from a white bag and gave it to dad.” “It was a gift with new prosthetic gloves.” Can I really sleep over there? Sure. -Thanks. -Bye, sweetie. See you. Dad! Don’t touch my stuff again! This sounds real. She could’ve made it up. Her dad’s life is on the line. No. Wait. If she bought him new gloves, they could’ve had a good relationship. She was good to him, then why kill her? What in the world happened? So I was thinking... I’m not sure now, either. You’re not a law student, are you? She fell from the 9th floor. The guard saw from the 6th floor. Is there a chance he saw wrong? Apartments these days are built so close together. You used to live there, right? You used to live there, right? Older apartments were built much farther apart. It’ll be hard to see that far. It rained that night! The guard wore glasses. Maybe he has bad eyes? Then it would’ve been harder to see! He could’ve seen when lightning struck. Boom! They think they’re detectives now? Damn! Everyone? Whether it rained and lightning struck or not Kang and his mom were the only ones home. Someone dropped her. Who could that be? Her brother? Her brother? He said he had a drink with his sister! What’s with you people! We’re jurors! We’re supposed to help reach a verdict! Why are you trying to investigate? Think you’ll find proof that his uncle did it? We don’t have to find proof that her brother killed her. What? We just need to find the possibility that Kang may not be the killer! The possibility of another person! If someone else could’ve killed her, Kang may not be the culprit? Is that it? Yes! Maybe the guard saw the wrong man? We don’t know that! You’re not a detective! How would you know? It’s up to the court to decide if the witness saw correctly or not! That’s the judicial system! Judges, prosecutors, and lawyers! They’re elite experts! They said it was premeditated murder! If you’re not sure, just follow their lead! But what do you think? What? Not what the experts think. What do you think? What I think doesn’t matter! But what they think... We just need to see if the guard saw correctly or not. If we find that he couldn’t see, then Kang Du-sik... may be not guilty. CRIME SCENE INSPECTION PLAN You want to go where at this hour? Who suggested this? I heard jurors in the U.S. inspect the crime scene. This isn’t America! I thought a law student would know better. If you’re done discussing, please conclude things soon. Your Honor! Wait, please. It’s my first time judging anyone in my life. I know. The first time is always hard. No, I just want to do it right. Stay back. We want to do it right! Why stop us? Why can’t we check? We want to be sure! That punk. The investigation and trial were done sloppily! Who’s born a judge? If I were you, I’d let us go and check! Why you! Go back in! Chief Kim! I just heard. On-site inspection with the jury! What a great picture! It’s the perfect way to change the trial’s image! Don’t worry about the costs. Let’s go! What? It’s a red carpet frenzy here! Let’s go. Wait! I’m a juror, too! Have you reached a verdict? See you later. We’ll provide all means for the jury to make an impartial judgment. Thus, a crime scene inspection... We trust it’ll help us all get to the truth. Move! Don’t block us! Over here, please! It’s the 9th floor there. Up there. Let us sleep! Advertise there was a killing here why don’t you! Who’s in charge here! Is everything set? Ah... almost. Get them to move the cars now! Let’s go to the witness’ location. Please hurry. “When we do the best we can, miracles can happen.” by Hellen Keller -Kang Du-sik Let’s go. Coming! We’ll go to the building across to see if we can identify the face. Ms. Prosecutor?

ELEVATOR OUT OF ORDER Great. I need the exercise after being stuck inside all day. Let’s go up. -You first. -Sure. Let’s go, chief. What chief? I’m just a gofer. Take the hose up over unit 902.

Lightning, please. Did you see the face? Can you see? Am I the only one who can see? 4:38 a.m. CRIME SCENE INSPECTION ENDED It’s a murder case over money. This is an intentional murder. Now, we’ll decide the length of his sentencing. The defendant would apply here, between 15 to 20 years. However, it was premeditated, and the victim was weak and vulnerable. It was a cold-blooded... Your Honor? There’s no definitive proof he killed her with a hammer. The investigation was done poorly. It could be from hitting something while falling. I think... It’s difficult to conclude it was a premeditated murder. Thus, it should be an accidental killing... Then the sentencing should be less. It’s scary to make a decision, isn’t it? Will you feel better if we lessened his sentencing? When I wrote my first verdict, I was like that, too. It wasn’t a murder case, but a burglary. Still, I wrote and rewrote the verdict all night. It’s never easy to make judgments that affect others’ lives. This trial will stay with you for a while. Some of you may remember for the rest of your life. Thank you for all your hard work. DELIBERATION ENDED Take your belongings. Please stay here until court is back in session. Thank you. Oh my... I haven’t worked this hard in a while. We stayed another day. Will we get paid more?

Where the hell are you! I told you to be there when I got off the plane! I apologize, sir. Mom! You stayed out overnight? I had something important to do. Like hell you do! It was really important... Therefore, defendant Kang Du-sik is guilty... You took all those notes? Oh, this? I majored in engineering, then got into law school after three tries. This is sort of my first trial... Help! Somebody help me! What the! Geeze! What is it? A self-defence tool? -Well... -It’s yours? Help me! Help! It’s not me. Help me! Help! What are you doing? See? He ran right over. Get a professional to record. Who’d come to help like that? I was just giving him a few pointers. It sounded real. Wait! People scream for help when they’re in danger, right? Then why did the mother stay calm? Because he killed her with the hammer. What if she really hit her head while falling? There’s no proof it was a hammer. Why did we think she was dead? Because the guard said so. No! I’ll call you later, sir. We saw from the other side! From there, you can’t tell if she was alive or dead. The guard just thought she was dead. Because she remained still! There’s a possibility she was alive. She was alive? She was alive, but she didn’t scream for help? She didn’t want to live? Hold on. -What are you doing? -Let me check one more thing. You can’t touch that! It won’t take long. Kang Du-sik didn’t write this! “I’ll cut ties with my mother.” What are you doing? -Give it to me! -What’s this? Give it to me! Damn it! What the heck! It’s raining! What are you doing? Mom... For her son to collect welfare... Maybe she wanted to end it. It probably tormented her for life, making her son like that. He didn’t run away, but tried to save her. 911. How may I help you?

Hello? Which building at Donghwa? Hello? Sir! Please don’t hang up. Hello? Are you there, sir? All rise! Be seated! 8:00 a.m. THE SENTENCING Prior to sentencing, I’ll announce the jury’s verdict. The jury has unanimously found... So she committed suicide? Yes, Your Honor. Saying it was a suicide because the writings are different? That makes no sense! Based on the evidence, we can’t rule out a suicide. So everyone thinks he’s innocent? You all agree? Yes. We’ll take note of that. What do you mean? If we say he’s innocent, he’s innocent, isn’t he? Article 46, Paragraph 5 of the Jury in Trials Act. “The jury’s verdict does not bind the court.” I told you that during jury selection. What the... Simply put, the jury’s verdict is just a reference. The judges decide the final verdict. So even if we say he’s innocent, he could be found guilty? Your Honor, he didn’t kill her! He could be innocent! That’s the law. What kind of shitty law is that? What are you doing! You think you can take advantage of the law at will? We never thought that. Ever! You said the law doesn’t exist to punish people. Would it be right to punish people without any standard? They could be wrongfully charged! To avoid punishing people unjustly and to set a standard, you said that’s the law. The law doesn’t exist to punish people. Is it right to punish without a standard? They could be wrongfully charged. To not punish people unjustly and set a standard, that’s the law. Security! Escort them. Let’s go, please. Prior to sentencing, I’ll announce the jury’s verdict. The jury has unanimously found the defendant not guilty. However, the jury’s verdict is an opinion to refer to by law. Defendant? Please stand. If you’d like to speak, please do so. Case 2008-372. The court will now sentence Kang Du-sik, charged with homicide. We conclude, that on the night of the victim’s death, defendant Kang Du-sik fought with his mother. We conclude the victim later fell from her apartment and died. We also conclude that only the victim and defendant were in the unit. We conclude that the security guard witnessed the victim’s fall. In sum, we suspect strongly that the defendant brutally murdered the victim. “... 25 years in prison.” “When in doubt, consider the defendant’s interests” However, there is no direct evidence that he used the hammer to kill. The victim did not show any signs of resistance. And it’s possible, the guard, Bae Soon-pil, could’ve been mistaken. It’s difficult to rule out the victim could’ve committed suicide. As such, it is difficult to conclude that the defendant killed the victim with the evidence submitted. Therefore, as there is no evidence to conclude the defendant killed without reasonable doubt, the court finds the following verdict. Defendant Kang Du-sik, not guilty. What? We don’t know the entire truth to this case. “When in doubt, consider the defendant’s interests.” It’s the main principle of Criminal Procedure Law. The first jury of the People’s Participation Trial reminded us. As the law must reflect the people’s will, we’ve decided to follow the jury’s verdict. Oh my... Chief Justice was surprised by the not guilty verdict. But as it was the first trial with the people and judges as one! He loved this picture! Everyone’s happy. I knew you could do it. A judge must judge well! Good job. Now, let’s wrap it up. But I was saving someone. I’ll submit the sample now! I’ll be there in one minute! I’m already here. I’ve been here since yesterday! I’m serious! I’ll be there in 30 seconds! 2019, PRESENT DAY Juror 8? Where are you going?
