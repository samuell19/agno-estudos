(Modified subtitles for non-native English speakers and other slow readers) LIMPET LOVE -Hey little asshole, have you unlocked the safe? -Yes. -How brave of you! -Yes. -Are the goods still in the safe? -Oh yes! Don't fret, if anything goes wrong, we'll call the fire brigade! Don't get any funny ideas, you leach! See, you bunch of jerks? Oh, shit! How d'you pull these things off again? I've put the luggage in coach 15, compartment 21! And for the first time in history, the train from Hungary is on time! If I had wheels, I'll always be on time. Hey cornflake! Do you breathe at night? In Timbuktu, we hoped everything was better here. Even sleep. So you're wearing your best pajamas? These are all I have. I'm poor. But, my mother was from the circus. Is French all you speak? He speaks lingo with his mouth, Yugoslav with his hands, Japanese with his feet, Arabic with the ladies, and French with his... Fuck! Drop it! Drop what? I'm afraid you might drop your wallet into the specter of capitalism! Of course! To survive! My father died a year ago, my mother three months later 'cause she loved him. We need foreign invitations to leave Timbuktu. My mother's sister's daughter who is a movie star... you say star? Me, I only like movies on TV. My girlfriend says I never buy them. -I don't have a girlfriend. But a cousin, Martha. -That's the same. I was locked up in a mental hospital. Tofu is some meat for vegetarians. -It's that simple? -Five years times two! -As for my father: seven times seven is... -My name's Laymo! That's my name too! But my father was... a King! -Mine was only a Prince! -Mine was old school: poet, Jew, writer! Me not... Hi, my name is Michael! -Delighted. -My brothers: Francois, how French can you get, -Antoine, even worse... -Don't push it... Ferdinand Le Baron. This guy's just an idiot, can't you see? Wanna see her face? What do you make of her? I like her face very much. I was there, gawking like the rest. She looked at me, but didn't see me. -But, tonight... -Tonight? We're going to kidnap her! -What's going on? -What do you think? Passports, tickets, cha cha cha! Duvigny. Defarge. Theron. Fuselli. Salesman. Ten foggy days in Amsterdam? I just started my shift. We're just chatting with a friend from Timbuktu. We're in first class, coach 15. Hungarian... Can I see your luggage? Enthusiastically, sir! To be enthusiastic means to be inhabited by Zeus! Brilliant. Hey... That policeman looked just like you. Brothers with different names... and I'm not a friend from Buda. Hey, Martha! We are arriving in the station. Let's get candy, let's get food, let's get movie posters! Isn't Amsterdam richer than your Buda-shit? -Nobody picking you up? -I wouldn't bother anyone. The ambulance won't come so soon, shall we have a snack? Here, buy what you like! Cigarettes, candy... But there was no fog in Timbuktu. In which mental hospital were you again? Will you remember my bros names? I'm so sorry... it's my head... hurts... Beauty, fitness, sickness, women! I've seen that film. Let's go to the pictures! See the one! Dig it? Commons! Here you have to buy! And to buy, you have to pay! Enjoy it? Snap, rush, touchdown! Here, they shield everything in the same way. Their women, their movies, their money, their paintings. They're so wary, and rightly so. Now we're fisting! -Glitz and glamor... -Come on, Prince! Like some shit? Have it! Choke on it! See that! Fisticuffs, huh? Do you think I look chic enough? My hair, nails... and my feet? You don't wear my earrings? Difficult, considering... was it you? Earrings? Tip of the iceberg... -Why tonight? -Because tonight I feel so racy! Why me? Because tonight... I'm horny! Do you know how to weigh or measure worth? Well, do you? Sorry, I steal everything. I mean, buy everything. Good for you. Courtesans yes, maids no! -Got a taste for it? -Haven't we eaten? -Was it you? -No, it's me. Then strip. So, are you disturbing the peace? It's only Andr?. On the table! Time's up, oldtimer! You'll never steal what isn't yours ever again! These words, bit shoddy aren't they? Just like all knock-offs! Anybody moves and it gets worse. But why should I have to pay! You're getting ahead of yourself, Joseph Venom. Your Picassos and Bacons and those fellas who paint your ceilings. I know those guys. The others finance your entertainment! The cake for you, the hole for everybody else! Ladies and gentlemen, hello! The Middle East! Flat-packed atomic bombs! Nerve gas! Independent producers screwed over, so some kid can get kudos for what's not his! Our export figures look so good in the National Assembly reports! And I'm a zero! -No, the other one. -Sorry. -So what now? Go straight to the hilt? Right. I'm doing this by the numbers! The price of the Queen, like in Shake-a-spear. You must have ran into a book, now you're no longer working the streets. I would like to meet the Queen. You have to take her, you buy her, you have to deserve her. Come on, all together! O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, How are thy leaves so verdant! Were you talking about me? My love. But I'm worthless! The Queen! The cops are outside! The place is surrounded! And you! Under what name are you working at the Ministry? Delacroix, Delacunt, Delacock! A Jewish name like Ben Asshole? Stop your bullshit! Lay off. He's honest. Like honest? Be honest, then! Keep it simple and straight. You love her how much? You don't get it. She's very expensive. Sorry... Thank you... It's not right to steal. I'll give you everything. My name, my memories, my life. My film collection. Throw me away whenever you want, if you have to. Idiot. Don't get hooked, that's my woman. You want to love her too? -Yes, that's my handkerchief. -And me? Oh yes! And you? Maybe. Lovers... Friends... A meeting of ends. I'm taking her, she's too decent for you! -Looks serious. -You're right! Let your dad rot in jail! Changing your name, that's German! Who are you in your new family, shithead? Shit, help me, Matalon! How long have I been saying she's nuts, boss? Start digging your grave, dickhead! Yours will only need a lid on top. Music! Roll end credits! -I love you! -My God. Can you stomach this? You should have gone to a posh deli in Neuilly. -Does he love her or what? -He hates her! Who the hell asked you? And who's you, anyway? -Sorry, I didn't want to hurt you. -Idiot! You'll regret that very much. So, Laymo! What do you think of Amsterdam Nights? Hah! Just wait for the main course! Don't you miss the pigs? -You won't snout, will you? -No. -Why? I don't judge anyone. Who judges the judges here? Men who have women and friends they're shelters from justice. Can you keep on picking my dishes? That's class, eh? Not even lost her appetite! The best for you, my gem. My black gem. I'm not a black gem. I live like my mom did. In expensive clothes, in luxury, in flesh, without pleasure. But it'd be good to find one who loves me, a husband, just like in real life. The Venom family are four people, or? I'll make Ancient Mariners out of them. Impressed? Me no high school! A black gem in the hollow of dunes. Cold Venom for the vultures, and a gold toothpick for my father. That's the lineup! Now paint the town red! Shift asses! Shake heads! Hey you! You don't care being late to my engagement, embarrassing my brother? Sure Martine, you're pushing it! I was in pain! Women have it once a month! -You got here at 9 like everyone! -You're too rough with her! Hey baby bro, feet too busy spinning in your oatmeal? A cheap, pathetic fuck, that's tops for you lot! Princesses for Princes, and trailertrash for flunkies. You'll never get beyond that! That's not about you, Prince. If I hadn't worked my ass off for six months, we'd never pulled the job off. You didn't believe in me, and you still don't. One shouldn't be crawling on all fours like a worm. My star! Venom is a bit scrunched, but still alive! Reliable sources blame the Armenians! A bit skittish they are now. Venom was dealing with Turks! That's great! Mickey Micheyan sewed the shit, now he can drink it. They're assholes, those kids. It's the moon, Mercury. Mickey, he's a marked man. The stars are my thing. You've got scared? There's a door behind to stick. -I couldn't. -Because of her? -Yes. What's her ass got that mine hasn't? She's fragile. That's all in your head. And your head is here. You slut! And you wait long before you get it! They're coming! My comrades... It's not the same syndicate,sir. It's private here. It's not them, detective. The landlord assured me they've been here since 9. Oh, I know these guys. They re... small fry... tiddlers. Their father was in the Resistance. Dirty little habits... The tiddler says... Good evening, Miss. Fire and brimstone at Mr. Venom's, huh? You made a good move. I'm making another: Your engagement present. -With good behavior 7 years minus 10 days. -Shit, how could I know? They dragged me out only to say you're kidding Venom. It's not 45 or 68 any more. -In 45, you were king. -What a result. -The streets are there. -Me too. My head isn't on a poster! But your father has to clean up after you. Your stepbrother's right, better to forget. So they got you for a soldier's pension, right? What I did, I did in memory of you. And for her. That's one too many, Mickey. To survive, you've got to forget! I did it for you. Here, have your beloved son! Your favorite! I love you! Mary! Mickey... Judas... To survive, it's better to survive... See what's left? The old man's dead, Donald's dead, my woman... Your woman was a twat. Here, park this! Don't bad-mouth Martine! It's a bit late for niceties! I have a woman and a friend. I'm home and dry. You said that, didn't you? -No, it was you. -Same thing. Park her for me. We've gotta pull out the stops. It's not The Beatles any more, it's Attilla and the Destroyers... no future. If there's still a future, it's tomorrow, 15 rue Nergal. Now duck. -You trust this jerk? -The hot stuff and the ice queen! -Like some medication? -Sure... I know a drugstore. Antoine and I knocked it off some years ago. For peanuts, petty cash or speed! Remember, Antoine? We'll keep the hearse. -Why not leave it here? -What for? Should I throw in two wreaths and wait for the P?re Lachaise to open? Coming? Just a sec. Time enough to waste this jerk first. -Are you retarded or what? -I touched Martine. This rat is jinxed! Here they come! -I warn you, lying is my thing. -You're not what's lying. -What then? -Poverty! -lf one lies, it's to get... -One shouldn't get! Here, it's okay. Jeez, my clog! We can't stay here! -Do you have money? -No! It's full of memories here. I started when I was thirteen. I never hurt. I made supermen out of them. Don't worry, my tiptoes are always cold. The ice queen doesn't want to die. To sleep... to die... to kill... to make love... Same battle. What are you? -Matchet man? Pocket knife? -Pardon? Friend of a friend? Where did Mickey unearth you? In a train. -What were you trafficking? -Myself. You're a simpleton? Can you say virgin for a man? Not for long. I'm hurting. I'm bleeding! No, you're coming. I'm the one who's bleeding. You're wet, when I want you! "L?o, don't wait for me. Forget the address, forget everything. Mickey's okay. Anyway. I'd like... I can't... Yes?" We don't give handouts. Autographs and postcards via mail exclusively. Hungry? The ladies are sleeping. No noises please. Come into the kitchen. Coffee, chocolate, tea? At home they force-fed us all your disasters. Floods, wars, terrorist attacks, kid soldiers... we shrug off propaganda, we want proof; we don't know who we are anymore. But darling... In the Kingdom of the Blind, the one-eyed suffers. So don't look. Chat up in the morning! Death in the afternoon. You're almost as pretty as my mother! You should have let me know. It was easier to take the train! In which hole did you fall? It was a woman courted by a gangster! I slept with her. I don't know where she is. -Have you seen the Eiffel Tower? -I lost my luggage! My mom's picture, my father's last letter, his tie, handkerchiefs too! I don't know where! I loved her. That's not the truth. She touched me... moved me... You remind me of your father. He was handsome, your father. You always fall for beauty, especially the wrinkle-free. Your silly truths. Do they wash whiter? My shirt. It was the journey. The night. The rain... the rain... Does it turn you on or is it just stupidity? I turn on stupidity? Stupidity! And when your mother came to Paris for the last time, I knew I'd never see her again. I tried to talk myself into believing she was happy. They said your father could be released. We compared out destinies, like girls compare dresses. Now she was going to be reunited with a saint. A martyr, beautiful... noble. Her gift was living, and she got theater instead. My gift was theater. Instead I got snarled up in life... So it goes. She went back. She died of love. I waited here for a visa that's never issued to dissidents sister-in-laws. And I became as bad at acting as I am in life. Like the sky in the country. It's the Atlantic, the ocean wind. You know we've seagulls in Paris? I'm doing it at the moment, The Seagull. The play. My daughter plays the lead. Nowadays you become a member of the Academy after two cheap porns. She arranged for me a part in the play. You know it? Not really. Sea birds don't fly to Hungary. And what does a bird like you in Hungary? I was told to work with my hands. My head still hurts. A bird of different feather. I'm sorry, you make me feel uneasy. Nestor? To the theater! The bird touches down on the mud, leaves his mark, more beautiful than his flight, than his life. I think about my father, about my mother. I'm searching in the mud. -Don't you want to look at me? -It's difficult. Tough day? Was it easier with the gangster's woman? It was that she loved me. So one has to be in love to reflect? -It's better for the other one. -The neighbor? -Up above. Do you mean God? -Could you notice me for two minutes? -It'd be too sad. -But everything's sad, open your eyes! -I can't see into, but not... And how am I, into? Young. Would you like to visit? -I can also be a cheap a tart! -No you can't. You enjoy that? You really are fucked up, friend of a friend! It's Andr?! Andr?, meet my friend of a friend, L?o. Andr? is a man on the move. He's moving in Mom, who's moving him up. Forget sweet talk, when it comes to whoring, I'm his bet. "But once in America, what will we do? "Monsieur de la Fayette will provide you with instructions!" Agla?? -Coming! -Monsieur Simon has arrived. Some would rather be dead than red. And some would rather be red than dead. At that very moment, Gl?cksmann shakes his ritzy coiffured mane, and shouts his message: No neutron gale in Bloomingsdale! In the end, we arrive at the same point: order, discipline, and social progress. The gap between our theories is small. Wait and see, look at Italy... To each their theories, that's best practice. I'm not critical... It must be nice to finance stage productions in order to... firstly, entrap the bourgeoisie, and then plant bombs under their houses. But let's be fair... We are the guests of a lady. This is a first class lounge. Your bladder's not big enough to pee in all four corners. Let the children come to me. Simon, you destroyed my table plan again. You ruffian, you can't even talk with a fascist. Simon! A man like you should know that The Seagull is about revolution. A seagull stands for truth. We need a real lake on stage. Give me the means. At the end we open the flood-gates and enjoy the bourgeois taking the plunge! I'm getting nothing out of it. It's some hard row to hoe. I'm hoeing. I grease their wheels. I oil my piston. And then what? The old bag's ready for Ziegfeld Follies. Agla?! To keep her happy I should have the obelisk of Luxor. -Mary, I'm speechless! -What are you up to? -How did you come in? -This gentleman let me in. -Will you come to the lounge? -I'll start in the kitchen. Idiot. Andr?'s got guts. He does love me. I'm sure he prefers me to his mother. I share him so I can act better in the play. Do you understand? You've no right to judge me! You've got too much fog in your head for that! At last! It's okay. He's clean. -Hey you, have you news from Mickey for Mary? -I dunno where he is. Join the winning team? I told you that he would find me. He's my puppy. Like my sweet little brother! He knows about tomorrows. I'll give you your tomorrows, but hands off my today! Mary got back her ticket, but for a price. I was bowled over by her journey. And that was priceless. Stop sticking your weenie into what's not yours! Do you have an issue with your manhood? Shut it! Watch it, Albert... The good lord rears his ugly head when a prick tries not to understand. As long as you punch me, Albert! When you punch me I know you're alive! At last, we got the address for Mickey's hideout! We've known for an hour. You'll understand. Sorry for now. Sorry for before. Sorry for after. I didn't know where you were. You had disappeared. I called back. I looked. Then... Le Baron found your cousin's name because she's in that nudie mag. He bought the apartment across from yours, just for me. They never understood my caprices! And Mickey? What did you do to him? I destroy everything I love! I told you, I am a liar. The Venom is here, not entirely eradicated. By the way, did you know he used to be one of my mother's lovers? He just found out that you can't put a price tag on love, the nasty prick. A small time punk proved to him that he couldn't keep something that he thought he could junk. Now he can not, he wants not, he knows not. Thanks. I'll do it. Here comes the soup for my first broken Venom. Mickey's a mover and a shaker, but this mean Matalan, he's angling for... If this is still a man, he wouldn't take it, lying down! It's manhood at question now. Man's ugly business. Monor, power... Gonna start moaning? Was my mom moaning? Me? I faked the screams! A spoonful, my love? Love is a miracle, you want to see a miracle? I'm just following your laws. You are just a poor puppet fucked by a grenade. You can't fuck over, or even just fuck! Anyone! Anyone! Go away! Can't you understand? I'll come! I'll come, I swear! Shall I decorate with his brains too? I'm not ashamed. I'm not ashamed. It's not my fault. It's mine. Idiot. So you're in? Don't worry. The cops will be here in 3 minutes. Just let me do the talking. Last night's massacre? I wasn't there. This gentleman? we've never met. If you do this for me, never was there a young lady in this courtyard. -What are you doing down here? -I don't know. So we won't be playing ping pong? You must certainly have some princely motto, say: wherever I appear, the scum disappears. The barefoot... The Barefoot Contessa, one might say. Mankiewicz. She saw her mother die at the hands of the Venoms. The four Venom brothers. Like Mickey's four fingers. I've only wanted what's good for Mary. But she seeks her mother's fate. What can one do... Two days before retiring, And still sizing up guys who sell both, cannons and fodder, the catchphrases. But I keep trying, with the wild horses. Mickey, you, the limpet. 1000 to 1. The luxury of desperate gamblers. I could return you to your Hungary, but I'd rather release you into our wild. I'll take Mr Andr?'s statement democratically, like the Pope's edict. And I'll keep sniffing your scent. And Mary's. Sharpening my chompers and waiting for wonders. I'll ship your miserly, meagre coffin back. I don't like you. It's because of her. She's deranged, she feels the cold. What's eating you up... Shut your trap, Mr. Innocent! Don't forget that I'm being generous to you! Just like the Police at home! Wanna feel my trotter? A real Parisian pig trotter? Grilled too? Thrash him out! His stupid suitcase too! In case he falls over even more. You still in one piece? It's my fault, I shouldn't have left you all alone. I like it raw. But I would like it to get raw for me. Curse you. Mary, full of ice, The Lord is against thee, Punished art thou among women, and punished be the fruit of thy womb. Nergal! 15, Rue Nergal! Follow the guide, prince! Without me, you'll never find the path to passion. Isn't it what you want? Mickey has a bone to pick with you. The bone, I love that. The bone and marrow... without the pheasant, nothing is pleasant. Without spice, nothing is nice. The gravy is simmering... Mickey without Mary: no religion. Mary without Mickey: no way. "Lizard and Necessity". Nobel Prize, rings a bell? CHANCE AND NECESSITY That's it, a short survival course for the innocent going on trial. I'd surprise you with some French history, it's still South against North, sombre against dirty, Parisians against Arabs. Second door to the right. But my dear, watch out. Cock fighting in Chicago, 1930... and no elevator. He's Mickey's pal. Hot! Hot! Hot! It's almost burning. Time's up. A European Encounter of the Third Kind. I've got a job for you. Mickey's not well. He's lost his mojo. He'll lose his life if he keeps that woman. Take her away, do it for me. If Mickey's not chirpy, he's no good. I don't want him! I want him to go! -You did her! -I love her out of pity, Mickey. Don't you pity me a little? -I love her out of sorrow. -I love her full stop! -She respects you. -Like one respects graveyards. I'll never leave her to you. It's for you she took that flat across from yours. Yes, but there's still three to go in her noble cause. You up for it? Now she'll run away from you. Mickey isn't a brute. I believe nothing. It... you know... It's tough to hurt you. I'd kill you if you were a woman. -I'd wrap the blade in silk. You wouldn't feel a thing. -No. She would. Buzz off! Oh no! We are such children, prince. Mary... See? -D'you suffer? -D'you? Our clients! -Right on time for church! -You got Gothic mosques at home? -Doctor Gilbert Venin, I presume? -Shit Livingstone, asshole? -Mickey the Arab wants a word with you. -I'm very expensive. -You got the creeps? -Don't worry, we're in a pest controlled area. -What's on Mickey's agenda? -Disneyland! -That's gonna be tough. -No, tomorrow at midnight... ladies as witnesses, face to face. It's high time. You shit flies keep buzzing around Mickey. If he ever comes out of the Casbah, he'll regret his mad wanking. He's not mad, he's here! Get lost! Oh my! Oh my! Your what? Do you have an aspirin? Your lovely brothers. Simon and Edgar, for instance. Out of your league. Forget it. Edgar. 5 am. Blow deal. Rue Lenine. In Charenteuil. That's our turf. Sure you've got no aspirin? Office... Future & wellness. Apartment... 12. Don't fret. It won't be bleeding for long. Now it's a habit! Well, kick it! Future & wellness. After we're done they'll qualify for a new plaque: Past & Flabby Cankers! Once more! My half brother, L?o, Mickey. Edgard Venom. What does he poison? He's the fat pussy with a small... I can't see his full costume. He heads "Buildings and Investments". He's investing in me. He's pumping shit into your veins. They'll screw you for believing them. All that's in vain cause you don't have taste. Are you into family affairs? You unhealthy paranoid. I want the recipe! It's too complex. You won't get your head round it. Around what? That you and your pals swap guided missiles for Afghan dope? Dope to blow up in the street? So Buildings and Investments get clean books? For official stamps, we got Mr Andr?. And where's Simon Venom in all of this? Simon's untouchable. He doesn't mix with dirty Arabs like you! Dirty Arabs? Reminds me of waterboarding. You got a bathtub in here? Buildings and Investments operate through the Pole Pot Bank. Forget the bank, I want the banker! Apart from banking, what does a banker? Walk his dachshund through the park? Rare? Medium? Well done? Overdone? The theater. He took a shine to some piss pot actress. Care to impart her pseudonym? Agla?. Gla Gla! That tip would have saved your hide. Unfortunately, I have a kiss from Mary. -What can I do for you? -Nothing! Why do I make a show of it? Because... you're my friend. You know what I feel, right now, here? I'll tell you. I'm gonna barf. What am I good for? Nothing gives. Makes a void inside. You got religion? No! Here. That's for you. At least you don't kill. My woman. My cross. My skin. Anything else you want? Shoo, or do you want a bow on top too? No, I'll go to her! Don't sweat, she's here! It's done! Hold me against you, against him, against me. Stop me from running out, from drowning. Plug me. Whatever floats your boat... Life is good. Can you smell it? Take a breath! They watered the street, to make us grow on the paving. Yes, I do love you. We've got everything! Our weaknesses, Ideas, History! But what's keeping us on our asses, waiting for the Cossacks to strike? The burden of Money? The phantoms of Culture? The Final Solution? If we don't turn to face the Cossacks, it might hurt a little, get me? In 44 we won the Battle of the Rails. The Final Solution? Stale bourgeoisie farts. Take the middle ground, the people's power, the workers. The founders of society, the heroes of the future. The future belongs to the common people. Final Dis-Solution in champagne! Can not say... anything right! Above all... we mustn't kill... with all our thoughts... with each bite! Maybe teeth are for climbing trees. Like big toes? Does another world exist, without cruelty, or would it be even more deformed and ugly? When I'm hungry and thirsty, who forces me to think of the blood, and the flesh that my neighbor ogles? Of which slaughter house are we kids the inheritors? Watch out for the vase, cousin. Why? You're not good with reality. These clothes, this furniture, the prisons. I'm the same. I found a way out, the theater. You'll see. It's no place for oldies and good for my mother. It can really blow your mind, make you die better and faster. Doesn't make you happy, but it shreds you up. Better than anything. I'd like to stay here. It can be arranged. I have killer thighs. Simon's corpse can't say no to me anymore. That, I know how to do. We're all lost souls, souls lost in our flesh. You're lost in your flesh, Agla?. Do you understand? Everything's cold. ...can only destroy itself, with bourgeoise means, bourgeoise sets, bourgeoise costumes, bourgeoise acting, the bourgeoise at the bidding of the Revolution, in the name of wrecked humanity. Their souls melted into one... the universal soul, it's me. In me human consciousness blends into the animal instinct. And I can live each and every existence through me. This stuff sounds decadent. Alone in the universe, my spirit remains... She's fresh. Simon's ham... she'll get you. -It's beautiful, what she says. I want the book. -Let go! Did she get you? Who got me? Who got you? You did. I love you. You. I love you. You. I love you. You, I love you. Maybe you should take off your trousers if you want to see the light. Do you want me to? Why? Because people normally do it for me. I can also tie up your feet. Why? Because, usually I'm the one they tie up. And why that? Because usually I'm the ridiculous one. This way, we will forget each other. I'll take him back whenever I want to. Don't go! I have to go after her. Do you need to spread pain in order to survive? Even to a kid? She's no kid, it's worse. I'm worst! Want to bet? Is a proper little lady who wants the worst able to suffer? Is it trying to suffer? Does one really suffer in theater? You'll taste. Feel. I'll help you. Come. Are you hesitating? If you pull out of me, you're finished. Because of that? That? Lyon Station. I owe you for this one. Mickey will be happy! This is a pleasure, a vision of the Apocalypse, the whore on her throne of blood, the fourth horseman, the lamb of the seventh seal, Kafka and his goldfish! Kafka and his goldfish. Good. Good. There I can't. I spent my holidays here with my father and mother. My father died in that room. A bullet to the attic. I'm lying again. Did he hang himself? No... he goofed it up. He... The rain. What's up with you? Soft in the head? Did you get lost? Yes. Here, with you. It's not like in the movies or in books, where everything is precise, thought-out, organized... with a clear-cut goal. Everything's chaos, chance... pain... disorder... Still, my sense of order is to get things, one by one, my mother's lovers. There's one left. -Do you want me to tell? -No. What for? To know my life. There is no life. There's only a war. Listen. I can't hear anything. Close your eyes. Mary? You're gliding too high, friend. You're gonna crawl back. I won't cushion your descent. You're overdosing. If I were human, I'd waste you here and now. I'm not going to be human. I won't go back on my word. I don't want to rush you, but theaters run on precise timetables. Go betweens too. For packaged news, I'm the only one, for timely deliveries. It's me. For the right address, it's still me. One last breath of fresh air... and it's time to go now. Don't get alarmed, L?o, The commissioner's here to make sure all's quiet on the Alpine front. Better carry a piece. Me, never. Mary, she's his most precious thing. He's burning through those creeps who got their kicks from grilling his wife. A hero, the commissioner, in the line of suffering. Stoke the dice. Load the fire! The carriage awaits me at the gates. Don't bother, I'll go alone. May I have a drink. -Where're you going? -To town. -Is Nina Nicolaevna here? -Yes. Last Thursday, my uncle felt unwell. We sent him a telegram. Why did you tell me you kissed the earth I walked on? I should be killed, to be put to rest, to be put to rest, I am a seagull! I warned you: lies, dullness. I don't want you. I'm an actress! He didn't believe in theater, he always used to mock my dreams, and I stopped to believe in them too. I lost courage! And then the turmoils of love, the jealousy, the constant fear for my little one. I was becoming petty, insignificant, My acting was stupid, I didn't know what to do with my hands. I couldn't control my voice. You don't know what it feels like, knowing that you act atrociously. I am a seagull. Since I came here I've been walking a lot, I walk, and I think intensely, and I can feel my soul strengthening. I know now, I understand, Kostia, That in our trade, artist or writer, the essential is neither the glory, nor the sparkles, it's all I dreamed of. The essential is to know how to endure. Learn to carry your cross and keep your faith. Here's the item. It's intact. Now, let's talk details. Abhorrent, isn't it? Are they plotting, or what? Our fianc?es. Here's a doll. Here's the head, here's the feet. I turn her upside down. Close your eyes, close your eyes. There! Show me where the head is? Now, her feet. And now her sex. That's a good one, huh? Isn't it? Do us a favor, please? Could you turn the stage lights on again? It's a child's dream. Turn the lights on! -Do as she says. -We won't start again! Not you. You performed.... I got what I could for you. Did you like my acting? I could smash... Why did you tell me you kissed the earth I walk on? You have to kill me! I am so tired, to rest, to rest! I am a seagull! No, that's not it. I am an actress. That's it! He's there too. Yes. But that's nothing. He didn't believe in theater, he mocked my dreams, I stopped to to believe in them, I lost my courage! And the turmoils of love, the jealousy, the constant fear for my little one. I was becoming petty, insignificant, my acting was stupid! I didn't know what to do with my hands, didn't know how to stand! I couldn't control my voice! You don't know what it feels like! She's better than me. Learn to carry your cross and keep your faith I have the faith, and I suffer. It's ridiculous. Chicks like this... When I think about my vocation, They said "whores". One should... Life doesn't scare me anymore. Put them down? Here's the last Venom, the untouchable, the only one that never touched me. The one that lights the match! I don't want the penguins splattered in ketchup. Especially not in front of the cops. Enjoy your meal, gentlemen! Ministers of Integrity! Thank you, show's over. It's not over for me. You tried to buy me a theatre but I resented you and went crazy for that innocent. He came from Hungary just to fuck up things here. The innocent is a dog. I bought him back from this harlot - I was wrong. -Do you still want me? -I want everything. Where ever you want. As long as it's now. And I want him to see it, OK? Search him. The wax of the seventh seal drips on the butcher's fingers. The lamb is ready. Here, if you please. Same as them. Am I frightening you? Lower. Where it's real. Where it smells. Get lost! Get lost! The door behind you! Me. Leave it to me! You little cunt! So, about that killer video... "Gone with the Wind". Ass... hole. Don't fret, he won't see me again. I just want him to understand me, and to forgive. If Mickey's okay with that. Are you hurt? Where? Ba-ku-nin... Comrade Vit-a-min... Che Guevara, "The Bolivian Diaries". Maurice Thorez... complete works. "The Young Marx: Misery of Philosophy" Fred Astaire. Woody Allen. Who's that? "Gone with the Wind". Mickey, I've got it! Come on! Torch it! I was there in the tree. Eleven years old. Ditch class at boarding school. I needed to see her! A Sunday once in a while wasn't enough! She didn't even bother packing her bags! How she was fed up with my poor cop father! And he with her. It killed her. She wallowed with those pigs. In their dough, their drugs, their shit! Mommy, mommy, my mommy! I followed. They fed me, they dressed me, they beat me, but they never sullied me. I'm like her, I'm like her, I'm like her, like her... like her... I'm like her... Mommy, mommy... mommy! My mommy... Now that I am King... and that the Queen is Queen... Impossible is a French word. I'll never marry you. Leave the ending to me. I need this money! I need this money... It's too great. Expatriation! What is that? Oh, I forgot to tell you, big surprise! Your mother's corset exploded. Ambulance, firemen, four nurses, two obstetricians. Nine and a half pounds on arrival, incognito for seven months! A triumph! It's all your doing... Madam's my age. From each according to his faculties; To each according to his needs. My poor little thing. Is it love? My cub... Love. I'll show you. Mommy! The smell is the proof. You don't leave a friend wounded in the trenches of old age. Especially when they're incontinent. Here I am, my friend. Come on, get down here, you prick. Do you want me to snatch you by the balls? Jump off! And stop fidgeting! Remember you said... that I'm doing all this for Mary. You were right. Do you know what a lost girl means in French? Nobody knows any more. It's a woman that keeps on walking until she falls apart. You can never help her. Ever. You can try to kill yourself. That's all. I know... You'd tell me I could nab Munch Bunch at the parking lot, or the villa... I'm not God. I'm just holding his crayon. That's all. One more point, I'm not like the ones you've dealt with at home. Come on. I'll give you a lift, whereever you're going. Tell your fucking Minister, I clean up this city all by myself. That I defend the law in spite of the laws. Raising the rats against each other. It's an art... rarely appreciated. Are you going to get me my medal? I'll tell everything! I can't go further on. Candy? Don't swallow the pit. One last detail you've missed. Mary... I tracked her down less than a year ago. I'm her father. Honduras, Salvador, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Libya! Albania, Egypt, Nicaragua: war. I often have this strange and penetrating dream of an unknown woman... whom I love and who loves me... Do not spoil this tender act of being or being not. For I have lived up to our pact, awaiting heart is all I've got. Wisen up, Pain, and hold still. Were you demanding the night? It's coming down, at will. Black air, envelops the city, bring peace to some, and to some the pity. He's been in there for hours with that bitch of his. Do you want to unbind him? He keeps the door closed, and says nothing. Try to shake him up, for fuck's sake, or we'll miss the big barbeque in the white city. You are the only one. And you didn't do anything. L?o, it's the Prince of Idiots. I was doing it in her sleep, but you woke her up. I did wrap the blade in silk. She's not hurting too much. Come! Do you want to finish the job? -Mary... I love her. -And me. -Do you love me? -L?o, yes! By the way, she told me again I made love to her like no one else. Then she said it wasn't important. My father, my mother, you. Love. The same feet, the same toes, the same footprints. Footprints change with the sole of your shoes. The mud without marks, that's me. You're cold. You're warm. You're hot. You burn. You kill. Do you want to finish me? Don't piss about! Take off your sneakers, so they think we aren't here. I won't give her up to anybody. No. She belongs to me. If God made us, he would have made us different. The rats have made off. I'm offering you quiet on the western front! What are you doing all alone in this gutter? With me, you have a chance! You can all rot with her! This stare, not for me. I've got to see Him! Now I can't see a thing. Now you can see for real. At the end of a regular film, I'd go on a killing spree too. I'd be the hero. But there are no more heroes. Just the humiliated. Stop your bullshit. Let's walk out barefoot. Made off, the rats, welfare! This is the end, my only friend. I won't have the lake. There won't be any real revolution. From now on don't budge! Hear me? Watch him. Save me. Take me. Any place you want. This film was inspired by ''The Idiot'' by Fedor Dostoevsky. It is intended as a homage to this great writer. Original translation: Daniel Bird & Andrzej Zulawski
