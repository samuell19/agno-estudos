You're early today. Uh-huh. Hang on! - It's an anniversary. - Bartender's day? - No, you've been coming for a week. - Well, there you go. Thanks. To mark the anniversary, you may smoke inside. I don't smoke. - What? - You don't recognise me. Look... - I gave you a week. - Yes? I know you can't remember everyone you've loved, But, you know, I was... special... You've mistaken me for someone. You have a birthmark in the shape of Africa. Unless now it's Europe... I'll go and check. - Got anything? - They said sorry, they'll be here at five. - But our guy's coming at six... - Great, they can meet in the doorway. - Wait a bit. - Sure. He's coming, he matches the description. This nutjob has at least four dead bodies to his name. Four dead soldiers. So let's move it, gentlemen... and ladies. Isn't he too short? Can we reminisce some other time? I'm waiting for someone. I know, for a week now. - So, it's been nice to... - Nice. We went to the engine room... Look, a minute for an old flame. Justa, please. I've got work. It was summer, we were lying on the concrete. Remember those big wheels turning? I fell asleep, you woke me up. Geez, how can you not remember? You even showed me your panties. - With the butterflies on. - You're mistaken. You don't remember? The witness has arrived. Remember, lead the witness away once he identifies the target. - He's meant to be a commando. - Right. - But he's a short-ass! - You'd be surprised. Barman? In a moment. - A Mountain Apollo was here. - Look! - Maybe I had ones like that at school. - Exactly! Bacia? Geez... Is that you? Bacia! I was your first. - I don't believe it, sixth grade? - Sixth. Spring... For fuck's sake! I'm talking to the queen, can't you see?! Hi! Fuck! On the fucking ground! Get down! It's not him, it's not this one! Tell your friends to put down their weapons. Go in, go in! The sniper's on his way, get away from the windows. Slowly put the weapons down. Slowly, I said. Kick it. You too. Your colleague too. You don't like her? Step back! Turn it up. You! Collect up all the guns. Move it! Fucking move it! Take them by the barrel! Faster, give them to her. You're too stupid to live. Hi. There's an army guy on the roof. They were supposed to get the fuck out. Put the tables up. Tops against the windows. Move it! Move it! Who is he aiming at? Did he introduce himself? What's your name? My chief's asking. He's packing up. Stop him. You're to wait. Just covering my army buddy, dickhead. Target in sight. - Was it a hit? - No. Fuck me. Tell me who? Where are they? Open the door, open it! Find a crowbar. No, a sniper's there! Go through the back room. Where's that crowbar?! I'll fucking kill you! I'll cut your insides out. I'll fucking rip your brains out through your ears, let go! That's cute, but... How come the army let it go? They bring us in, tell us shit and just wait... - They probably wanted us to screw up. - Good morning. Good morning. Maybe we blew the guy's cover for Bacia? Why did he have an escape route? Well, he is a commando. Working there undercover for a month, tipped us off through Shorty's mother, so we'd bring the witness to him for slaughter? - It could be. - Huh? No, I hope not. No way. Yes. - A scratch. - Keep your ass behind your desk. Couldn't you have stopped him? I could have not saved your life, to catch the sniper... So why didn't you do it? - You're soft, Raspberry. - And you're like a pillow. Ass behind your desk. He's killing his old army buddies. - Something in his past, perhaps? - No, nothing. No way. Just an ordinary kid, no killing frogs with a hammer. He lost two brothers and his grandpa in one day. The whole class went to the funeral. Three coffins. - Hit by a car? - Mushrooms. Toadstools. - Stupid. - Right, stupid. I remember I got told off for wearing pink socks. It can traumatise you for life. Yea! I don't wear pink anymore. - So what is it now? - Butterflies. Get lost. Auxiliary activities. - And you, hand in your gun. - What? My office. - It's thanks to me they know who he is. - That's great. I come from there, I have contacts, I can work him out better than anyone. You know him, you're off the case. But he's not my lover, just a childhood friend. - It doesn't reduce my effectiveness. - I can see how it doesn't. Daro! You let him take you fucking hostage, the witness is dead. And you're still talking back? - My kid's being looked after, I can go... - Take some leave. Internal affairs will question you. Holy shit... Great. I'll get to a hundred. How many was it? Forty-one. Fuck! Well... - Mum, can't I go to dad's? - He'd rather you didn't. I mean... Too busy... He'd definitely want you to. - I hate her. - You'll manage somehow. She's boring and talks all the time. Tell her you have to practise, she'll stop talking. Right... But then she'll tell me to sit at the piano all day long. I hope so. Louse. What? Louse. Go, or it'll burn and start to stink. Come on, mum! Oh, come on! Right... sorry. Sorry you're a louse, and mean. But... I shouldn't tell you that, huh? Exactly. Get the jam. - Hi! - Dad! Hi! Hi. Give Lena a break sometimes. She's always practising. What kind of childhood is it for her? I'm getting married. I have no choice. Aga's pregnant. It's good we didn't have a church one, huh? But we had a civil wedding. Yes. The point is, we need to get divorced. I'd prefer a 'no fault' suit. We're talking. Dad, mum's going away, can I stay with you? Sure. What are those bruises? Did something happen? Look, I'll leave you the flat, but you'll have to pay it off... I'll need the car, we can sort out the rest. - Two grand. - What? You heard. But Justa, from my salary, two thousand a month? The Moscow course, English and Russian classes, a better piano. We'll need extra for those, what were you thinking? - It's already stirred. Want one too? - No, no. I'll call you. - What course? - What course? With Avdeeva. She's only accepted three of her age. You didn't know? Justa... I'm begging you. I'm going to have a baby. Please understand. Perhaps you'll be lucky and he won't be so gifted. - For fuck's sake! - You dick! - She should quit the piano. - That would suit you, huh? So we've settled who has rights to the child, then? Ready. Police! His brothers and grandpa ate toadstools, and they died. - No, the grandpa didn't. - He did. - No, just the brothers. - There were three coffins. - Two small coffins, and one large one. - I saw them. - Where was I then? - No, the grandpa didn't. He came to my mum and cried that he'd killed his grandchildren. - What the fuck are you talking about? - I swear to God. But did he go before or after the funeral? I remember because when he cried, he did that seal thing. That's why I am sure his grandpa came to us. Yes, he did that seal thing. Here I am, pushing myself through. From now on, you're protected by the crown witness law. The contract ceases to be valid if you give false testimony or commit a crime. - Do you understand? - Yes, I do. Here. In March they moved us from Bagram to the Italian base in Puli-haram. We were to prepare the takeover of the facility. The Italians had already set up the business, producing and distributing heroin there. They offered us a share. It was very lucrative. Very. And we decided that... If it wasn't unanimous, we wouldn't do it. We just wouldn't get involved. The voting was secret, there were four votes in favour, and five against. How did you vote? In favour. And then the commander said... He said that he'd need to report it higher. On the same day, we found the commander, Gerard Konop, we found Gerard, his remains. I mean... he'd been run over by an MPV. Who killed him? Who? I don't know. Good morning. Hello! Maszczyk? Do you recognise me? - "The Six Bullerby Children". - What? "The Six Bullerby Children", 1978 edition. - Loaned out on... - Can I pay it off? No, your dearly departed mother did. Ah! So what's it about? It's about "The Six Bullerby Children". With illustrations by Czajkowska. I came to ask if you're in touch with the Czwartek family, - there's this anniversary and we wanted... - No, I'm not. - Aren't you Bacia's godmother? - So what? Can you talk to me about them? - I'm busy. - But I'm not. You can't do anything to her. It's lapsed, 32 years have passed. It lapses after thirty. I checked it. It's thirty years for murder, that's correct. She's had her punishment. And she raised the children better than any orphanage. I have nothing against this woman, honestly, But half the police in the country and the army want Bacia, and I might be the only one who wants to understand him, maybe even help him? And did Bartek help somehow in that... thing which has lapsed? How could he? She drove to choose the coffins, took him along, as she didn't want to leave him with grandpa. They got home, grandpa was by the barn - she pressed the gas. It wasn't good for a kid to see that. She wasn't thinking, and it happened. How come it never came to light for so many years? Mushrooms: the adult organism took one day longer. I admire her. Pardon? I admire her, really. Do you know how hard it is to kill? I've been on the force 16 years, but I've never shot anyone and I don't know if I could. You know what? You know what? You have to know how not to forgive. Excuse me. Hi, what's up? Look, a man has just come to me for an examination, a beaten-up spleen, a bruised kidney, two other bruises, nothing life-threatening, but the material will show it, so I'll describe what I saw. Well, that's how it is. You see, he says his wife beat him up, over child custody or something. I'm just telling you out of professional courtesy, of course. Bye. Fuck... Don't you know the word 'leave'? Are you seeing how far you can push it, because we had sex once? Justa! He cuffed me, he could've done anything, I just care. If I fucking see you within a mile of him, you'll put in a transfer request, got it? So, have a nice holiday. - Daro... - That's all. - Can you do me a big and illegal favour? - No fucking way. And for Lena? Piotr went for an examination. We had a bit of a fight... and... And he didn't hit you back? Not really... Hi. A bit. What? No, dad didn't. He didn't even call. Everyone's left me. Ok, I have to go and open the door. They're delivering the corpse of some poor little pig. Come in. What? No, it's some catering. Oh boy, dad has to stay with that old bag, as she has morning sickness. Today she puked all over the hallway. So you know I'm going to have a brother? Yea, catering, dad sends me dinner, and a courier delivers it. They're pretty good. What? No, he didn't say anything. Mum, I don't believe everything dad tells me or you tell me. OK. Bye. - I've thought about it. - And what did you come up with? It's a bit shitty. A bit. - Any defensive wounds? - Yea. Come, defend yourself. Enough? The more, the better. Hi, hello, not crossways. Great, I love it when you curse. - Look, she's 13. - Piotr, coffee? White, yes. She's 13, what can't she do, huh? Open the tap, lock the door? She's got food, a bed, a vacation from an overprotective mother. I can't now. And I don't want to. Who's afraid? And you leave her on her own when she's afraid? Ok, I'll check. I'll check now. Ok. Booze. Let's do it! 2 April. I don't care how you save them. Oh, that's not a problem. I don't care. And out of curiosity - when we slept together... was it before he cheated or to punish him? I would've forgiven him. For sex? Easily. But he fell in love, the son of a bitch. He fell in love. You moved it. Did you see that? - Aha, it moved. - It moved. You moved it. - Am I touching you? - Take your hands away! Thank you very much. Well, leave it now, let it be. Ok! Come on. - Show me the other side. - Which one? More to the left, good. It's ok now. - What is it? - Hold it, stop there. - Stop. - Now the shoulder. - More to the light. - Like this or that? - What are you doing? - What do you mean? Don't mess around! I'm not messing around! Hey, stand normally. You can see it better like this. Done. Thanks. Why aren't you picking up? You shouldn't do that. I'm looking at your childhood photos. Damn it, you were so skinny, like a stick. And you tell me to eat so much? No, I don't think so. Mum, when did you start smoking? Weed? This is funny, you want me to come quickly, right? Yes, come home, because I have a really awesome surprise for you. What can I do? It's awesome. Lena, I'm really coming back. Ok, so you're coming? Hey, but you really have to come. Ok, I have to go, because the ice cream's melting - and I have a guest. What, can't I have my own life? But... Ok, I'll tell you, but you won't believe me. It's a friend from primary school, bye! - Lend me your car. - Now? A day, two tops. Hi, if you're not my mother, you have 15 seconds to leave a message, but if you are her, better think twice if it's really important. Bye. Hi, if you're not my mother, you have 15 seconds to leave a message, Coffee's ready, want some? Lena? Lena? Where the fuck is she? Grzegorz Szutra. There you go. I'll call every day at 9am and 9pm. Give me the address for Grzegorz, and you'll find Lena. You want me to give up your last army buddy, right? Yes, please. And do it without your work colleagues. But he's a crown witness, no paper trail, just the name, no pics... You want to know where she is? I also invited a crown witness for a meeting once. It's a question of motivation. What's your motivation to kill off your unit? And what's my Lena got to do with it? It's a question of motivation. It can move mountains. You'll see. She has food and drink. Food for 5 days, water for a week. Well, unless she has a bath. - It's a recording. - No. It could be. Here you go. Lena... Lena, can you hear me? It sucks, I know. - Turn up the sound. - Focus. I have to hear her. You have to do something else. Want me to turn it off? Lena, first I have to do something, but then I'll come back for you. - I can't do it the other way round. - Hell no. Shut it! Is there a window? Lena, please, don't fall apart in there, Here's what you should do... you hear me? You must count time. Is there a hole to see if it's daytime? Can you hear something there? You must count time. But how, fucking how? Think, Lena, think. We don't want her to panic, right? But to survive. Ok... Those preludes are thirty, forty minutes? Play them through, without interruption or speeded up. Play one and mark the wall, do some exercise and play again, every 9 concerts you eat, after eighteen go to sleep. Then count down to the night. Lena, don't panic. Please. When I say I'll come, I will. One minute. Darling, we have a minute, let's start the concert. I'll be playing with you all the time, all the time. All the hundreds of times. Come on. Come on now. That's it! Don't lose it, or let it go flat, this is Lena's life. - Bacia... - Grzegorz Szutra, crown witness. - Who? - Man, what do you want? - Man, you're nuts! - So, who killed the commander? You both name him and you live, ok? - Fucking look at me! - But I don't know. One. Two. Three. - Maciek. - Grzegorz. I need all the best men now. - Now. - You should knock. What I'm about to say can't leave... Guys, the thing is... Well? Nothing, never mind. The informer conned me. Sorry, you know. Justa... Justa, what is it? They moved it to five o'clock. Come. What is it? Nothing, just a mistake. Are you going after Bacia? I'm getting a divorce. My daughter's taking it badly. I'll take more leave, huh? Can I keep the car? Piotrek has mine... A week. Well, what is it? Do you want a Pulitzer? Huh? Do you? Because I know a few other journalists. - What do you mean? - Afghanistan. - We're no longer fighting there. - Exactly. Here's a list of 9 soldiers, only these 2 are still alive. The rest are dead. Soldiers... they went to war, got shot. Pulitzer-winning stuff, for sure. He died in Puli-haram near Kandahār. This one was stabbed in Kielce. Wędrzyn, Warszawa, Mikołów, Katowice, Katowice. This is the guy killing them, I went to primary school with him. Now, the last one is a crown witness. They don't know where he's being held, only that Bacia's going to kill him. Do you know his name? Corporal Grzegorz Szutra. Medal for courage. Divorced. No data about his wife. Son - no data. The parents are dead, no siblings. Born in Michowice, he lived there for 3 years. Then nothing - everything's classified. You find anything, call me, ok? Anything. If you don't call - you and I will regret it more than anything. Piotrek, just believe me. Will you call? - Piotrek? - No. You know why? Because I beat you up. My lawyer saw the photos. I'm just a piece of shit. How is she holding up? Not panicking? Bacia... You have to give me some back-up, you hear me? Something might happen to you, Bacia... Have you got anything? Speed it up. I've been waiting for you, miss. Good morning. God bless you. Yes? What seems to be the problem? It's a little awkward. Father, my fiancée proposed to me. - That's wonderful. - Yes, two years ago. But when I ask him about the date of the ceremony... I see. And it's no longer just the two of us. Cigarettes. Huh? Cigarettes! Yes. Right! Jesus... I mean... I'm sorry... I don't know how to say it. I'd like to know if there's any obstacle. An obstacle, exactly, an obstacle. - Year? - 1988. Grzegorz Szutra, born on 17 Jan 1988, Miechowice. He only lived there for 3 years.

Hi. - Do you recognise me? - Are you Julia's mother? - No, I'm a friend of Bacia's, I mean I was... - I don't know, sorry. Only Grzegorz is still alive. He can't trust anyone, - Children! Go inside, come on! - Talk to me, please. - Come on! - Maciek was a crown witness, too. Five minutes, Anna! Nika, come on. Matylda! Grzegorz shouldn't trust his bodyguards. Bacia shot Maciek, despite five policemen and his bodyguards. - Tell him. - Rafał! The police are on their way. - Come on, Rafał! - Only Grzegorz is left. Boys, go inside. Come on, run! Hi, do you have those licence plates? Read them out. Look, I can call at night, don't turn it off, please. Ok? Ok, got it. Is she holding up? I don't know yet. I'm working on something, call me in an hour. Bacia, wait. Talk to me a little. What happened in Puli-haram? Ask the crown witness. - Was he telling the truth? - No. Exactly. I'll call you in an hour. Bye. Wait, tell me about your grandpa, what was he like or...? He used to take me fishing. Authorisation successful. Waiting to be connected with a consultant: up to 2 minutes. Be advised that all conversations are recorded. Anna Radej, how can I help you? Good evening, I'd like to turn on the service "Where is my child" for 574051854. Yes, he will confirm, but only by text as he's... disabled. But miss... I am asking you politely. He has cerebral palsy, he's going to camp in the morning. I just didn't manage to arrange it. Please could you...? Yes, I am waiting. Thank you. I could have something, call me every hour, or half. He's 3 km east of Łutowiec. Where's Lena? I gave you the coordinates. Now Lena's address. There's no child, Bacia. He's with his wife. - Give me the... - Keep your head down. Get the kid away and you'll get what you want. Come on. Grzegorz, it's that woman. Hi. - Go to the car... - No looking around! You go to the city and call the police, and you'll catch him alive. - Get in. - Look at me. I'm looking. - Give me the piece. - No. He has my daughter and he has to tell me where she is. - Give me the piece. - No. I'll put him in the car and you give it to me. He won't see. He'll see. - He must be alive, do you hear, alive. - Don't believe her. Hide. - And don't call any police. - Call, think for yourself. - Give me the piece. - No, you heard me. Give me the piece. You heard. Drive and wait! Don't come back! Police, police. Bacia! He's got a gun! Fucking leave him alone, let him go! Bacia, Bacia, where's Lena? I won't let him kill you. You hear? Fucking focus, where's Le... He's fucking got Lena! Bacia... You're fucking nuts. 16 April, testimony of Grzegorz Szutra. What do you fucking need that for? The ratio of votes, who was in favour? Everyone. - Except you and the commander. - Who killed him? Who ran him down? Maciek? Not Maciek? - You fucking killed him for no reason. - Then who? Who killed him? Me. Bacia, where's Lena? Tell me where Lena is. What was that? Tell me, fucking say it. Where's Lena? Where's Lena? Tell me. Can I go now? Yes. - That girl from Bytom had something? - No... it was a hoax. They couldn't read it, sorry. Fuck. Do you have the card? There are a lot of gaps in it, and it's a microcard. Look, with the card, Justa will get 15 years, and she'll be out after 7. Without the recording, she'll get 25 and do all of them. Blow up those rocks. - But it's a protected site. - Fuck. Goodbye. Go, go. Fuck, I don't have any. Wait. I'm gonna take the fucking joker... Fuck, take it. And I fucking had you all there. - Like hell you did. - Oh, Jesus. - Easy, easy. - Relax, ok? Only these. And why did you want the cross? Because she gave me a sign. Justa... Because she crossed herself. When I talked to her. There, in the cellar. Lena is not even baptised. Do you know where it is? You're about thirteen or fourteen here. No idea. Do you remember who took the pictures? Zuza. - Zuza? - Zuza, a friend. - It was a trip. - To a mine? A mine. Mysłowice? He told me about this place. He told me about this place.
