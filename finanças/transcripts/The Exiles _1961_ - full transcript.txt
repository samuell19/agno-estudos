I don't know what to do sometimes. Now I'm having so much trouble. And sometimes I feel that I'm happy where I'm at because I have a little baby coming, and I've always wanted a little baby. And at least I'm getting one thing that I wanted for so long. A child of my own. All right. Who's next here? Thank you ma'am. How many ma'am'? I don't think! want to take the little baby back to San Carlos I rather have him raised out hers. I want him to speak English and try and maybe go to college, or become something. I would like the baby to have the things I didn't have in my life. Now, those were The Revels with one that everybody digs so much. It's called Tough Breaks. Number three in this whole town heard first right here on this rockin' old show. You're making it with Larry McCormick, Mr Mac, the tops in tune from the frantic Atlantic to the terrific Pacific. And since Friday evening is always a good time, we gonna roll along with one called The Good Times, sung by Charlie Wright. # The good time # The good time # The bad time # The bad time# I don't see much of him. And when he's home I feel all right and, uh, hoping and wishing all the time that he will stray not. If I hadn't met him, I probably would have been all right now. Maybe I would've had what! wanted. I have tried to be a good wife. I did everything that! thought it would satisfy him, like cooking for him when he comes home, and I iron his clothes. And I always have his clothes ready for him in case he wants to go someplace. Come on. Get in. Freezing. Freezing. What say Homer'? I'll see you as soon as I clean up. - Wake up you all. - Hey, man. Wake up there. What's going on here? Looks like you've been down in the sack all afternoon. Hey, Art. Art, wake up, man. Is that my wallet there? Oh, is this yours man? I just found it. I was gonna give it back to you. Here. Yeah? How many payments did you make on it? About 12 payments. Made in about two months. Should've got a suit for that. Yeah. All right for two. You know what? Hey, we'll go out. We'll see you guys up there. - Hey, Tommy? - Yeah, man. How about cutting my sideburns, man? What do you want? Close shave -or 'cut and hide'? - Just cut them anyway. All right, man. Here, let me lather a little bit for you. I don't wanna cut your hair off, you know. Hold it. Let's see. Oh, you're bleeding, man. Hey! No kidding! Oh... - No, I'm just joking with you. - Don't do it, man. Wheeling on this early Friday evening, Larry McCormick here and we 're gonna change the pace now to a... Hey, man. Come on. Let's go down there. - Hurry up. - I'll be right out. Cheers. Come on. Let's eat something. -All right, man. -Seems like miles up. Come on. How about some of that bread there, man? Give me some beans. You should save some pork chops for them guys. Save some for Tommy there. - Want some pork chops? - Save them. Save them. I'm just taking my share here. Just getting my share. Yeah, nice. But, ten slices you ate already, right? You gotta eat to live. - The chaha, man. - Don't eat so fast, Tony. YVONNE: Well, if the boys are going to hang around or stay at the house ell the time, then he would stay home. At least Homer did try to look for a job. But the rest of the guys, I don't think they really tried to look for a job. I see them here almost every day. I wish lot of times he'd stay home a lot. But he doesn't. And than he asks me if I wanna go to any place down to the theatras or down to shop. He usually take me a lot but he drop me off and he don't pick me up when I ask him to. You know we're going to have a jam session tonight? Jam session? Looks like it is jammed up now. Letting that lead her usually. Come on, man. Let's get you a drink. Hey, man. This place is loaded, man. Hey, that's working, man. - What say, Joe'? - What are you doing out here, man? Who's this pretty girl? Yeah. What's happening there, man? Darn. Give me a swig. Hey, man! When you going back to reservation? Hey, what say, Ursula Anne? You've been working hard tonight, baby? Hey, how about playing it for me, baby? What do you want? E2? G7? All right? Easy. You sure look nice tonight, Anne. Hi, Nina. When did you get out, man? Hey, man! Did you hear about Ursula, man? Sure made out last night, you know. Crazy. - Oh, hi, Ursula. - My name isn't Ursula. It's Anne. Oh, Ursula Anne you mean? Just plain Anne. Okay, who's gonna pay me? Don't forget the toothpicks, huh'? Hey, put it on my charge accounts. You already owe me from last night. -It's working tonight. -How do you know? Well, I heard she got paid today. I bet she's loaded. Hey, man. I don't want no glass. You pay me now. I'll pay you when I get my cheque, you know. You better pay for it now. Okay, no more until you pay me. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. You're hurting me. Let go. Let me go. Will you let me go? Rico! Rico, you suckerface. How're you doing, Rico? Sit down. You'll make the place look shabby. Hey, Rico. Give me a cigarette, man. Yeah, give me a smoke, man. Come here, man. Oh, man. I thought you were gonna give me a cigarette, man. What are you doing, man? What's the matter with you'? What's happening, man? Thanks, Rico. Tommy, you wanna go roll some dice? Take all your bread, man. - Play some cards now. - We don't, man. Sit down. - Mind if I sit down? - Come on, Rico. Sit down. Sit down. It's all yours. Hey, man. I got a feeling this is gonna be my night. I'm cutting out to a poker game, huh'? - One of you guys wanna go with me? - That'll be good, you know. Yeah, I like to make it, but I got no money. Well, I mean, you know, you know me, I've been looking for some suckers -so I can get some bread. - Don't believe in gambling, man. We're gonna play some cards and maybe shoot some dice, you know. Might take all your bread, man. HOMER: Man, this is the same thing all over again. You just sit there and listen to them talk over and over on the same subject. Guys, man. You know how they tell you about their troubles and all that, and especially when they get high, you know, they tell you about how much money he lost or who took his girl out or something like that, you know. I mean, that's old stuff. When I wanna go in a bar, I don't like to you know, sit around. I like to, you know, have some kind of excitement. Get into a fight or something. I mean, you don't want to get up and just walk all over town or something. Let's go, Rico. I'll see you at the hill, okay? And most of these guys I met down here grew up on the reservation And well, me, I grew up in Valentine, Arizona. You hardly see it on the map. We used to sit by a store, you know, in front of train posts and make fun and laugh at those tourists when they come around, some wearing Bermuda shorts and all that. Cameras, and some of them used to take pictures of us you know, sitting around there. Soon as they get through taking that picture, you go over there and get some money off them It was good, them days. My dad worked there, for a hospital. And I went to a public school there, I guess, for five years. Hey, Homer, here's a letter from home. Got something back home from old lady, man. Maybe she sent some bread, eh? I mean, I could have went ahead and finished high school but I was kinda... Well, I thought! was smarter than everybody, don't you know? And getting into trouble and all that. And than at that point, I just dropped out of school. That's when I started drinking there. I finally said, 'Ain't gonna make nothing out of myself' so the only thing I could think of was going into the navy. So I thought it would be better for me in there too. But when I got in there, it made it worse. I was stationed up in San Diego, aboard ship. When I came from Diego down to Main Street, that was the first time I came down there. But I didn't know where the place was till I met two Indian guys, you know. And they asked me if I wanted to come along. He said, 'You might know somebody down there.' So, I did come down there with them I mean it was easy to find friends down there, you know. Everybody, you know... I made friends right away. Then I met this girl from my home you know, same tribe. So after that, every weekend, every chance I get, I come down there. I was pretty bad off too. You know, when I got discharged. I drank every day. I mean, I never missed a day. All right. Maybe I could have said no if I wanted but... I don't know. Okay, man. I'll get a big jug. Where are you going? I'm going in the house. Okay, man. Let's make it. I mean that's it. That's why we want to take the drink and you know, wake 'em up so that we can cheat them. Hey, wait a minute. Why the old lady don't just come out with that bread though? Come on, Rico, let's move. ...after a line but let's stick to the frame, you know. You know what? Hold my coat, man. All right? You better watch my material, man. You know it's top rank, man. I'll show you how. Crayon! Truthfully, man, I think you know white people got more troubles than the Indians do, you know. They usually have, you know, just something on their mind all the time. My people mostly roamed all over the place two-three hundred years ago before e white men came and you know... Well, they used to move all over the place, all over the canyon. You know, from the canyon up and than back down again. We did a lot of farming around there. Com, squash, and... I guess they lived mostly off the land, you know, all kinds of you know, berries and all that. I rather be in that time than I would in this time now. Hey, move it. Here's my pad, man. Don't Dee live around here someplace, man? You've been a good boy, Emilio? Hey, here's my little boy. What you been doing today, Emilio? Take off that alarm clock pause with a 'wake up' power-packed package of double energy. Fortified with a new miracle mineral, blue tap. Say, Julia, I need some bread. Stan your days with zest, whim, and vigour in that double-flavourad, double-com goodness. Try Double Crisp tomorrow. No, I mean I'm just gonna take a few dollars. I mean, I ain't gonna take all of it. I'm just gonna take enough for me and my buddy Homer. I'm only gonna take about three dollars apiece. It's so... I mean... I'm gonna win some money so I'll give it back to you. Say, Danny. Let me wear your hat for luck, huh'? All right. Go ahead on, man. Let me take half the Crisps, man. You take the other half. Oh, we're gonna take some up there for them guys. -Just take a little. -Never mind about them people up there man 'cause they're lame people, you know. You can't walk straight anyway, you know. How you figure that, man? I got busted for drunk driving once like that. These guys man, most of them, most of them that I know, and they said, 'I'm gonna be down here for a while.' So I'm gonna drink and raise all kinds of hell. Then later on they said, 'When I got nothing to do 'I'm gonna just right back to the reservation.' Stay there for a while and then come back again And they come back sooner or later. This is where them guys are playing cards, right? You mean this one'? This is Dee's pad right here. I think there are some guys in there, man. - Say, what's happening here? - I think they're crazy skypiece. -What's happening? -Come on, Rico. Break out your T-bird. We know what you got. What do you say, man? Hey, who's dealing this deal anyway, man, you know? Come on, Rico. Lay the bread down. We're ready to get it. Wear my hat for luck, man. That's the toughest hat on the street here. Rico, watch your skypiece now. You're gonna muss my hair. We heard you guys had a tough game here. Come on, guy. Sit down now. I mean it, lady. I'm not at those races because I've only got 10 bucks left in the world. You're kidding? I guess you couldn't understand that, could you? Why not? Well, that mink coat you got on, that ain't hay, you know. If you must judge by appearances, what about those Scotch tweeds you're wearing? Oh, I had these before. But I've told you, now what's your reason... Golly, Tommy, when are you gonna buy us a round? We bought the last one. I'm gonna beat your girlfriend for her bread. Then I'll buy you a drink. You wanna bet? I'll find out how much she has that she's been buying booze for everybody? All right. All right. Give me that purse. I was just going to buy you a cocktail, baby. No! Come on. I'll buy you a drink. - Champagne? - No. Indian champagne maybe. - Well, okay. Let's go play the jukebox. - Don't pull me. - Watch it. No! - Come on. Will you'? - You gonna come or not? - So, keep your hands to... Let's go over there. Gee, Cliff. Why don't you go sit down with that broad? I know her, boy. She's real fine. She's carrying a lot of bread too. - Well, hello there. - Hi. How are you'? - How long have you known Tommy? - Well, I've known him for some time. What you gonna do tonight? - What do you care? - Well, I'd like to take you out. - Take you out to a dance or something. - Yeah? Yeah, I bet. - Oh, no, I'm not kidding you. Okay? - Then, what are we supposed to do? - Well, we'll dance all night, you know. - Oh'? Dance all night? - What about playing some music? - Darn right. Come on. Let me take you out for a date tonight. Okay? Come on. Good enough? - Come on. - Well, maybe. I'm high right now. We'll have a good time. - Mm-hm. What are we gonna play? - We're gonna rock and roll. Anything. Anything. - Rock and roll. - How about E7? - That's cool. All right. Come on. - Yeah. Turn you on tonight. Good enough? Yeah. But who's gonna turn off? Well, I am. Turn you off. We'll get all carried away, you know. Go up to Hill X, you know, drink some Indian champagne. - Good enough? - Crazy. - All right? - I don'! like it. You gonna let your hair down? No. It's too much trouble to put it back up again. Oh, come on, Claudine. - You want to'? Come on, baby. - Oh! - Come on. - No. Out of this world. Out of this world. We're gonna rock and roll. You like that beat? You like that tune, huh'? How about that? - You like that beat? - Real jazzy. Let's rip it. Hey, give me two brews, huh'? Hey, my boy, Tommy? Get with it, boy. Work with it. Work with it. Come on. - One more time. - Look at that footwork. - Give up with the footwork. - Come on, Tom. Let's tear it up, man. Get with it. Give her a spin... Oh! Two times here. One more time. Aha! Aye, aye. You gotta be getting the swing of it now. - You mind, darling? - Not dressed enough... All right. Well, let's dance. How'd you like our last tune then? All right. Well, what are we gonna play now? Hey, that's what I wanna play. K2. I'm feeling good. It's about all, you know. Could be. Anybody should with me. Yeah, all right. I'll play a good piece for you, baby. - Real piano. - Fats Domino. Hey! Then let's just rock it a little more. - You like it, huh'? - You should try, huh'? - Good, huh'? You like it? - Classy. Huey 'Piano' Smith. You should live so long to play like that. Let my hair down. Let down any more, nobody is gonna notice you. Look at 'em keys flying. Man, you're really playing that stuff, huh? Come on, Tommy. Let's cutout, man. Let's go to dance. Hey, we're supposed to go to a dance night, you know. - Watch him. Watch him. - Yeah. Hey, we're supposed to go to a dance night, you know.

Hey, you said you're going somewhere important. - Did you know your pants are dropping? - All right, man. Goodbye, cruel word. TOMMY: I don't like to make a fool out of myself, but I did drink and you know, when I want to do something, I'll do it. When I booze, I'm not gonna sip on the drink. I did drink and get high, that's the reason I... Drinks are for. Why don't you tell this guy we want to go dancing'? Can I help you, sir'? Oh, yeah. Give me five gallons of regular. Regular'? Hey, I thought you said we were going to go dancing? Hey, man. Come here. Come here, I want to talk to you. Hey, I going to see what Tommy wants. Hey, man, I got something I want to tell you. Come here. TOMMY: I mean, I'm not jealous, I'm not greedy, I just like to have my good kicks. When I'm with somebody, I just have my kicks, she has her kicks. What she wants to do is great with me as long as she understands me. I don't care what she does because, if I have to worry about every little thing every day that happens, for shame, I mean. If! have to worry about my chick cutting out on me or worry about this, worry about light and gas... Never happened. Okay. Hey, man. I figure a person who lives a regular life, lives in a worse world than I do, because that... They want to live the way I do but they just can't do it. And look at me, I don't want to live that regular life, you know, my poached eggs and, you know, Ovaltine and stuff like that in the morning, and get in bed certain times or have somebody kiss me every night. You know, or have somebody that! trust. I'll take care of myself. I can make it good, I can make it bad, it's up to me, you know. As long as I feel strong the way I always feel, well, they'll never get me down. And I know when it does, I've seen my days, well, I've seen good days, I got my kicks. What's going on anyway? Hey, you're looking like a squaw there, is all. You should be kidding, but don't kid me. - That will be a dollar and a half, sir. - No, she'll pay for the gas. Okay. That will be a $1.50 for the gas. Well, they're supposed to pay for it. They told me to get it from you. - Well, how much is it? - A dollar and a half. Come on, knock it off. Thank you. I got my bottle hid and you're not going to get it. Hey, wait a minute, fellas, I'll come, too. Hey, Mary, come here. I want to talk to you. Hey. Mary, come here. Join the huddle now. Hey, Mary, come here. - All right. - We're going dancing. - Hey, Tommy, grab her. - Come on, Mary, please. Come on. - All right, now, just leave me alone. - Please. Come on. Come on. We gonna take off. Stop it. All right, get your hands off me. All right, Tommy. I said cut it out now. There she goes. Tell the smart man I want to go up to Hill X. Let's go dancing. When I get up on the hill there, you know... Mary may have a lot of bread... Here's your change, sir. What's the matter with you'? What am I supposed to do? If I get the bread, I can get my girls like this. Oh, is that so? Yeah, okay, don't worry about it, huh'? Hey, Claudine, now, what kind of cigarettes are you smoking? Well, get Camels. Get Camels anyhow. Get Camels anyhow. So that's how it is down there, you know, just like a merry-go-round. Just wheel and deal, you know. Just going round and round. You meet your buddies, I mean, you know, you start drinking and next thing you know Monday rolls by and Tuesday, and than I'm still going, and it keeps going on, you know, from day to day, months. Before you know it, man, a year's gone And I'm stiff the same. Just like if you go to jail, it's the same thing. When I'm in jail I don't worry about it 'cause I can do time, and I mean, time is just time to me Look, I'm doing it outside, so I can do it inside. Hey, man, Mary's sure been in there a long time, I wonder what's happening with her. Hey, Mary. Come on, you've been there long enough. Let's go. Mary. Hey, Mary- All right, Mary. Shame on you, baby. Later for you. Say, man. Let's have a little lash. It's all right, man. Let's go look around then. Go in the Columbine and see what we can find. You wanna? Well, we can try and make a score. You know what I mean. Try and score some place, you know. Let it cool in there. Well, let's go. Go ahead. I'm going to finish this jug. Well, let's go, man, you know. Hey, man, we'll be through in a while. We got all night. Let's finish this bottle then, all right? Later on, you know, I'm going to pick up on some chick. Okay, man, let's finish the bottle. Oh, he wants me to buy them as well. Let's see if I got enough. Hey, tell me how much for beer. - Break it up. Break it up. - Get him out of here. Give me two beers, please. I can't. I can't 'cause you're watching me. Ha, that's funny? Hey, what's... What's the matter, Homer'? - There ain't nothing wrong, man. - So, let's go. Rico, don't sweat me, man, you know. Well, we're all here together, man. I mean, we can't just cut out and leave you here, you know. Come on, Homer. Let's go. It's all right, I'll be there. Don't worry. Man, if that stud don't shut up, I'm going to bust his mouth. Well, uh, let's go down to Ritz and look for some chicks, man, I don't want to get busted over here. Come on, let's go, man. I mean, we got to stick together, you know what I mean. We don't want no trouble here, anyway. Don't talk to my friends that way. I don't remember much from when I was a child, after my mother died or even before, but right now it isn't so bad as when I was a child. I have always wanted to go get away from my people there and all that. Go some place where somebody will, maybe, uh, make me feel different, be happier. That's why I'm glad I came out to Los Angeles. Well, all my life I wanted to get married in the church and! wanted to wear a wedding gown. You know, and not too many people but I wanted to get married in e church and be blessed. Have a nice house. And I wanted two little girls and two boys. That's all I wanted, just four kids. I used to pray every night before I went to bed and ask for something that I wanted. And I never got it or seems like my prayers were never answered. So I just gave up. And now I don't hardly go to church or don't say my prayers sometimes. Well, I've stopped going to church and all that already, but I haven't started drinking or hanging around on Main Streets yet. I know that will never come for me. I want my baby and I want to raise him up myself. I think I could do it. I don't know, I have to wait and see. He might change if he sees the baby. I know he likes children and he always wanted a little boy. He does, he likes children First, when we used to go visit people, and they said they always had a child around the house or something, he used to play with them. Sometimes we used to talk about it. And I always asked him what he would name it if it was a boy. He used to say, 'After me.' And then, if he wanted a girl, he wanted to name it after me Yvonne. I have a friend, Marilyn, down half a block from the house Ever since I got pregnant I have been going there to spend my time with her. I spend the night there and her boyfriend don't come back tiff the boys come back, too. About the same time. I mean, bars close at 2:00 in the morning, you know. Most of all the Indians meet after 2:00, and than uh... Indians like to get together where they won't be bothered and, you know, watched or nothing like that. And we tum loose. I mean to get out there and just be free, you know, where nobody won't watch you, where nobody won't bother you, nothing. Nobody watching you, every move you make. Stay on the ground here. Okay. Well, there's a certain uh, a hill that is about half mile from downtown LA called Hill X. You know, some people used to have cars around there and well, they ride all up to Hill X. It's pretty good, you know. I mean, it is cool up there. You sing your own tribal songs, you know. Anything you want to do, you know. Kind of reminds you of home, too, you know. Makes you wonder how is everybody beck home you haven't seen for a long time. Basically, a guy from your home you know, comes around there and than you sit and talk about old times when this was good. Hey! What you guys got? - Hey. - Hi. - Haven't seen you long time. - Hello. Hey, man. No, come on. Quit pulling. No. Let go of me. No. There's a lot of old people beck home who don't believe in, you know, doctors and all that. They did it with the help of old ways. We used to stand outside and watch the medicine men, you know, they wouldn't let no white doctor get in there or nothing. And they would sing all night, you know, just by the side. Even, you know, pull ell the blinds down in the house and they'd just sit in there and sing all night long. You get a funny feeling, you know, when you're outside, you know. They'll be real sick that night, the next morning they'll be sitting up, eating. A lot of people figure it's just fake, man, but I've seen it done. This is my old boyfriend back at school. Oh, he looks... He looks so skinny. This is my uncle. Oh, he's nice-looking. - How is the baby? - You want to feel the baby? Here, you can feel him. - It's moving. - It kicked me. It's jumping. Kiss me. Let me go. Let me go. Come on, get out. Break it up. No, man. It's all right. Forget about it, will you'? - I'll be around. - Oh, man, knock it off. I'll take you down some but I'll get you good. - No, man. - Hey, watch out. Don't be pushing me. - You want to fight all over again. - Yeah, all right. Yeah, man, breathe will you'? It's all right. Well, forget about it, will you'? God, darn it. - Come on. - No, man. I'm through with you. - Forget about it. - Hey, man. Come on, let's have a shot. Hey, I'll see you, Gino, huh. I'll see you guys tonight about the same time. Come on, Homer. Come on, let's go, Cliff. Let's cut out. Oh! Hey, now. Watch out for the telephone pole. Hold on. Hold on, now, little nigger.
