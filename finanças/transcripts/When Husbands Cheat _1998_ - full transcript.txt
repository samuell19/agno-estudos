[ Laughs nervously] Wow, boy, if I knew then what I know now. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I would do it all over again, the way we just did. I don't know, sometimes I wonder, uh... How I ever deserved you or... Or Sophie... Or, uh... Josh. A lot of guys may say this, but, uh... I really am the, uh... The luckiest man in the world. Cheers.

No, I'm serious, it is. It really is wonderful. You know that Craig and I have been partners almost that long? You know something?

I can't explain it. I just have this hunch. I think Bobby's fooling around. No! What makes you... Denise, why would you... Oh, will you please go dance with uncle frank so I don't have to? Hi, did Denise seem okay to you? Yeah. She was crying when you and daddy were saying your vows but everybodywas crying. You know, I thought it was going to be totally weird seeing your parents get married. But I liked it. What about Bobby? Bobby, crying? Yeah, right. Denise. Uh, come here. I'm sorry. You have to tell me why you think this. I shouldn't have said anything, today of all days. Are you kidding me? Of course you should. Craig: Hey, Tess, you got that ice? Ah, yeah. We'll get into this later. Yeah. Mom. Mm-hmm? Um... Brett and I are talking about getting married. Next summer. Um... honey you still have two years of school left. What about the sorbonne? Oh, I don't know what's happening with that. I haven't heard. But if we do decide to go ahead I'm going to take a leave of absence. Just for a year until Brett finishes. And then he'll support me and I'll go back and I'll go on to grad school. Mom... you do this. What? When you sense trouble you start wiping down surfaces. Oh, oh, there's no trouble. I just... Honey, I never had the opportunity for an education. What does that have to do with me? I can have both. This is not an either/or situation. You know, but Brett and I... It's supposed to be a partnership. You know that. I'm not going to give up anything. Mom? Mom... It just turned out to be such a cool thing you and daddy did today and I'm just happy. And I just wanted to tell you what Brett and I were talking about. And we're just talking. Okay? Okay. Now go. This is your wedding day. Go. Craig: I'll be there in 20. You have to leave? Yeah, sorry, babe. This guy we been watching... His wife turned up buried in the basement. What was up with your sister today? Oh, her and Bobby... Your daughter wants to get married. [ Laughing] I think she's too young. Oh, I know, babe. Hey, we got married at her age. We turned out okay, didn't we? 20 years, do you believe it? Tired of me? Oh, no! Mmm. You know, we ought to be at a romantic hideaway somewhere. Just the two of US. No, I mean it. I know I've said it before but... I would like to do that. Let's go right now.

Tess, our checking account has been off $100 twice now. And then... The sex! It's changed... It's gotten really great. That's bad? But the main thing is this feeling. Why don't men have that? Well, they do they just don't know what to do with it. [ Sobbing] Oh, neese. Oh, honey. [ Sobbing harder] Oh, neesie, come on. It's going to be fine. It really will. Come on, sweetie. Oh, honey. I don't know what to do, Tess. Well, o-okay, all right. So let's say he sent someone flowers. Now, we don't know what that means. It could be anything. I feel so paranoid, I can't help it. Look, it's probably not as bad as you think. But, but... I don't know, if, if... To put your mind at ease, we need to try and find out. Oh, what am I supposed to do, ask him? [ Laughing, sobbing] Well, I don't know. If you think something's going on then you need to check it out. [ Factory whistle blows] Denise: I can't believe you know how to do this stuff. Tess: Hey, I'm a mother. I may not know how to turn on a computer but I know how to be observant. Remember how we used to sit out here on our bikes waiting for daddy to get off work? I'm just glad he's not here to see this. Never in a million years did I think... I know, I know. Mom and daddy were lucky. It really was "'till death do US part" with them. Man: Bobby, see you later.

Can you just give US a minute? [ Sighs] Uh... well, yeah. It's kind of nutso around here. But, uh... All right. Go ahead. He had his stupid arm around her. And then the two of them left-- together. Oh, come on. Bobby? Are you sure? He's my husband. We both saw him with our own eyes. I don't know how much more you need. All I'm saying is that unless you have some evidence... Well, sweetheart that's why we've come to you. Because we need an expert's advice. Shirley, would you tell Mrs. Delaney I'll be right in? Sure, detective. Her daughter, Tara is a runaway. Oh, how awful. Yeah, 15 years old. Honey... If you could just... Tell US how to go about it. You want me to tell you how to run a surveillance. That's right. Yeah. I'll be right back. Oh, um, no dinner for me tonight, okay? Brett and I are going to the movies. So, we'll get something later. Okay. Sophie: Hi, aunt Denise. Hi, aunt Denise. Denise: Hey, hey. Now? Yep, this is it. What? What's going on? Uh... just stir the soup. Well... And stay with Josh. I'll be back later, okay, sweetheart? Great. This is what Craig said? How else are we going to follow him? Oh, I just can't. [ Sighs] [ Grunting] [ Plastic shatters] Oh, god! Bobby loves this truck. He's going to kill me. [ Dog barking in distance] I know Craig said to rent an old car.

I'm waiting. Neesie, honey, please sit down. Denise. [ Hushed]: Neesie. Neesie, wait. Oh, geez, don't forget the camera. Ow! Neesie! Neese!

Listen to me, calm... Nothing in your life will ever be easy again! Neesie, try and calm down! Is this a festival...?! Will you please stop filming this? I am going to kill you! My client agrees to a quick settlement... If,in exchange Mrs. Hughes doesn't go into court with the videotape as evidence. And, um, we have one other point. Yes. We would like Mr. Hughes to be responsible for the funds that he took from their account for his... Indiscretion. It was their joint account. We have the exact amount Mr. Fisher. Mm-hmm. Mrs. McCall. I don't know what your availability is but would you have any interest in doing some investigative work for US here from time to time? [ Laughs] Oh, Mr. Fisher. [ Laughs] That's really nice of you. It is, but... I was only helping out my sister. I mean, I'm not a... I don't have a bit of experience with this kind of thing. Really? Well, I like the way you think. I thought you did a very good job in there. I really did. Thank you. Thank you very much. Why don't you... Give it some thought and, uh... Give me a call? Sophie: Here. Okay, what about this? Shall I take that back to school? Yeah. Is that mine? No. Hey, sophe? I'm just going to say this one last time, about you and Brett. Honey, um... [ Laughs nervously] You're 18. I just don't want you to be in such a rush. We're not in a rush. We just want to be married. I don't know. I look at you and daddy and... Don't look at US, that's different. We're different. I mean, when I met daddy he was just out of the service and about to go on the force, and... I thought it was a miracle he even wanted me. Oh, mom, you always shortchange yourself. Oh. You do. It's just that he was this worldly man this well-traveled, gorgeous man. Honey, I guess what I'm trying to say is... I never had the chance to explore. Mom, I am different than you. I will continue my education. I know I will. I know you say that, but... Life has a way of getting in the way. [ Horn honking outside]Mom... Well, I'm sorry you feel that you got caught up in US. Oh, no, sweetie. I did, but it's what I wanted. I mean, my life has been... Very full, very happy. So are you going to take that job? Hmm? Oh, I hadn't really thought about it. Oh, mom, why not? The lawyer was on the other side. He must have really been impressed. I don't know. We'll see. [ Honking continues] Anyway, Brett's waiting. I know. Um, sweetie, I just... Want you to think about what I said carefully. [ Laughs gently] Okay, I will. And you think about it, too. Bye! Bye. Love you. [ Calling back]: I love you, too. [ Sighs softly] Well, I don't know. I think you might lay off her a little. Hey, you asked my opinion, so I'm telling you. What, you want her to get married? Well, no, not particularly. I just don't know how much we should get involved. I was just expressing my opinion. Yeah, over and over and over and over again. Honey, there's a fine line between... Hey, did you call this guy? Hmm? Not yet. What do you...? You mean, you intend to? Yeah, I thought I would, yeah. [ Chuckles] Come on. Babe, yeah, the man paid you a compliment, but... But what? But... He likes the way I think and... You know, I think I'm good. Yeah. Tess. I mean, what's the worst that can happen here, I fail? No, I mean... Tess. You don't think I can do it, do you? [ Mumbles] [ Dialing phone] [ Clears throat] Mr. Fisher, this is Tess McCall. Yes. Yes, I have thought about it and, um... Yes, I would. [ Laughs] That's wonderful. I'll see you then. Woman: Fisher and torroricci, good morning. Tess. Oh, good morning. Good morning. Welcome aboard. Come on, let's go into my office. I cannot tell you how pleased I am that you're joining US. Thanks. I've got some research I want you to do. Okay. I think you'll find everything you need at the court records in the county clerk's office. Great. Oh, by the way, did you have coffee? Oh, yeah, thanks, I'm fine. Also, you'll find the county tax files at the courthouse as well. I want you to check that, too. Okay. Tess: This week's been about legwork, mainly. You know, looking up addresses, records. Not like what they make it look like in the movies, is it? It's boring when you get down to it. There's one that's interesting. Remember that one I was telling you about? The client whose wife was always going away on business trips? Well, I followed her. [ Phone ringing] You did? She went to the airport, all right-- the airport motel. Hello. Oh, yes, just a moment. Here, sweetie. Hello. Oh, hi, yeah, yeah. Mrs. Delaney. Yes, about your daughter, Tara... So you do what dad does except you don't work for the police? Sort of. So, you spy on people. Cool. Well, not exactly spying it's more like gathering information. Craig: Good-bye. Who was on the phone? Linda Delaney. She's the mother of that 15-year-old runaway girl. I was supposed to call her. Anyway, starting tomorrow they have me down at the county center sorting through piles of building leases. Every day? For the next two weeks, yeah. Well, looks like we're going to have to fend for ourselves, huh? Out. Thank you. You got to admit, it is interesting work. And you're good at it. Thank you. Funny how life really is an open book. I mean, whatever you've done is written down somewhere. Yeah. Hey, hey, Dennis, meet Tess McCall. She's the one that worked on your case. Dennis bell. Nice to meet you. Excuse me one minute. So, welcome aboard. You've been here... A month, barely. You were my first case. Well, you did an extraordinary job. And my wife will think so, too when she finds out what I know about the guy she's been seeing. Really, you did a great job, thank you. Hey, here's the printout. Check the d.M.V. Right. And the registered voters listings. Nice to meet you, thanks. [ Giggling] Hey, have they said when you can cut back on hours? I didn't think this was going to be full time. Well, no, it's not supposed to be. Why would I cut back on hours? Well, I'm just saying, you know. I mean, you've got this place, you've got me, the kids. [ Giggling] Honey, hey, are you feeling neglected? Oh, not particularly. Well, what's he going to say? What are you saying? You want me to cut back? Well, no, I'm just saying that I think that maybe it's getting to be a bit too much. You know, I'm gone all hours of the day and night and now you are, too. Well... Okay, I will. I'll just tell them I have to rethink my schedule. [ Rock music playing] ♪ Oh, yeah... ♪ It's high time that you got my message ♪ [ Phone ringing] ♪ Don't make promises you can't keep ♪ ♪ yeah it's high time that you got my message ♪ Hello. Woman: Hello. Is this Tess McCall? Yeah, this is she. Tess, this is Sally Russell calling. Hello? Yes, I'm here. Thesally Russell? That's me. A friend gave me your name-- Michelle hess? I believe you did some work for her? Yes, I did. Well, I was wondering if I might stop in. I'm sorry to call you at home, but I have a matter I'd like to discuss with you. You mean here, now? I'd really appreciate it. It's very personal, and I've been told you're very discreet. Can I tell you, I just love Sally Russell's table. I read every issue, cover to cover. I get such great hints from it. I'm sorry, this isn't your brand. The commercial you do is so cute. Well, thank you. I do it because, you know I use their product in my catering business. Um, Tess? Sit down. Oh! Sorry. No, no, no! I'm the one that should apologize for barging in like this. Um... but it's Jason, my husband. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Oh. I met him in rio. I was catering a party and he was there. In a white dinner jacket. It was so... m.G.M. It was just like one of those old black and white movies. Sounds romantic. Oh, he was so handsome and... So Brazilian. I just love that accent. I could listen to it all night. But then I discovered that that wasn't his, the accent... [ Chuckles] And that he was from St. Louis. No, no, no. I didn't think a thing of it. I mean, I do exactly the same thing. I pick up on the way people talk, you know. Anyway, we fell desperately in love and well, we've been married for a year. Jason is... He's my business partner. Mm-hmm. And, um, he's younger than me. Oh, yes, I see. I mean, he's very handsome. Yeah. He's drop-dead gorgeous. I think he's seeing another woman. I think. I was just wondering if... You might help me? Yeah, I saw her magazine at the checkout counter. It's... she caters or hosts parties or something like that? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I just admire her so much. I mean, what she's managed to create for herself. I thought you told them you were cutting back? This doesn't have anything to do with the firm. I'd be taking this on my own. On your own? Well, yeah. I talked to Mr. Fisher about it and he said sure. Because I only work there part-time... Slow down, slow down, slow down. This is not what you've been saying, Tess. Now this is not the kind of legwork job that you've been talking about. I know. Do you? Do you know what you're taking on? For heaven's sakes, Craig. I mean, give me some credit. I give you plenty of credit. Then be happy for me. It's not as if we can't use the money. Sophie's in college and before you know it, Josh will be there, too. I know, I know. I just thought you might appreciate the fact that I'm able to contribute financially. I appreciate it-- I just want to make sure you keep some sort of perspective on all this. I feel like I'm in a Calvin klein commercial. [ Chuckles] This is my office. And this is his. But don't worry, he's not here today. Tess, I don't know if I can go through with this. It's like I'm already saying he's guilty. You told me you had a hunch. Mm-hmm. If you really do, you owe it to yourself to follow your own instincts. I have to tell you, though, if you open this door you have to be prepared to walk through it. Mm-hmm. Oh, I just want everything to be like it was in the beginning. I really don't know if I could survive without him. Then maybe you should think about this a little more. Hmm. Yeah. [ High-pitched whistling] [ Gasps] Oh. Help you? Hi. [ Laughs nervously] I must have gone past your shop a hundred times. I thought... I'm a private investigator and I was wondering what kind of equipment you might be able to show me for, you know, surveillance. What kind of surveillance would you be talking about? Oh. All-purpose? Cameras, all sizes. A lineman's telephone that you hook up anywhere you have access to the wires. Oh, wow. All kinds of wireless video and audio monitoring. Hidden microphones. Badges, I.D. Cards... A peephole lens for your camcorder. Really? Drill a hole in the wall attach this to your camcorder and you get the big picture in the next room. Oh. Recorder, wall probes-- lets you hear through walls. An electronic tracking device. You attach this to the car you want to follow and then this piece, the receiver lets you hear a continuous beep, beep, beep in your own car. [ Beeping] Perfect. Do you have a catalog? Oh, wow! Woman: Ginny got caught. Man: Then why aren't you home with her? Woman: Why aren't you? Who's the mom? It's your kid too! Don't push me. Police officer. Hey, hey! Hey! Woman: What're you doing, man? Get the hell off of him, will you? Go home. Listen, leave him alone! Stand back! He's my husband! Leave my wife alone! Get off him! Don't cuff him! Listen! Matthew, take him! It's our runaway. You guys... Woman: I am trying to tell you! Tara! Tara! Tara! [ Classical music playing] [ Laughing] Okay. Bye. [ No audio] [ Softly]: Say that again? [ No audio] Yes, that's it. Okay. [ Laughs] It's like an o'keeffe still life, isn't it? You know what Alfred stieglitz said when he saw Georgia o'keeffe's art work for the first time? He said, "finally, a woman on paper." I didn't know that. Yeah, he said that. Wonderful party. Tara. Aw, honey. Honey, I was so worried about you. Nice to see Mrs. Delaney with a happy ending, huh? Yeah, for a change. I missed you. I missed you, too. Woman: Shirley, line two. Usually these... [ Sniffling] I want to go home. It's a nice change. You are here alone. Me, too. Would you like to dance? Here? Yeah. Or anywhere you like. Um, actually, someone's coming to pick me up. Oh, lucky guy. Well... It would be my pleasure. In actuality, it was like the pinkest sand I've ever seen in my life. Oh, excuse me. We should probably get together in the morning. Okay, why? I think you're right to have your suspicions. Did you see him with someone? I had a little chat with him myself, so to speak. I taped it, it's on tape. What's on tape? Did he make a pass at you? Oh, my god. Listen, we need more so don't breathe a word to him until we can come up with some kind of a strategy. All right? Yeah, all right. Sally? Yeah, right. Craig: What, babe? I'm just feeling thankful that I have you to come home to. Well, now you know how I felt all these years. We're so lucky. Gone? What do you mean, gone? All his things. Yes. Gone. He took everything he could get his hands on. Wait... Thank god I still have my business. I don't under... I confronted him. I had to. Oh, Sally, I told you not to. I couldn't help it. What do you think? I mean, this has been horrible for me. Okay. I'm sorry, Tess, I'm sorry. It's okay, it's okay. [ Sobbing] Hey, babe, don't beat yourself up over it. It's not your fault. Yeah, it was. I shouldn't have said anything to her till I had the guy absolutely dead to rights. Most situations like this require a professional. You know, your pipes break, you call a plumber. What? Look, you were fine before all this and if you quit you'll be fine after. No, I'm not quitting. I'm not. Actually, Peter Fisher says I can rent office space down at his firm. Do you think maybe you're getting a little bit ahead of yourself here? Office space, come on. Craig, when I see what happens to these people my own sister... I... I want to do something. Honey, look, it is one thing to look up records in a courthouse but you could get hurt. I'm not just talking about your feelings. I'm very careful. No, these people, these... Some wacko you're trailing finds out then youbecome the target. Oh... You walk into some domestic altercation do you know that's how more cops are killed? You never know what you're going to walk into. Craig, for the first time in my life there's... I found something that matters that... I can actually do. And I'm going to do it. Tess: Yes, if you could just give US the correct spelling of your name? Right... yes. That's how we have it in our directory. Great. Thank you very much. Hello! How are you? I'm fine. Peter Fisher just told me you opened your own office here. Yeah. Come on in. It's nice to see you again. You, too. I wanted you to know that Maggie and I are in counseling. We're trying to make it work out. Good. That's wonderful. Um, do you want to... No, I'm not going to keep you. I just came by to say thanks for everything and I wish you the best of luck. You take care. Okay. Hey! Hey! Who's that? Who's that guy? Oh, a client. Oh, guess what? Another firm's put me on retainer. Oh, boy, terrific. Yes, Mr. Turner, Tess McCall. Yeah, I spoke to him. I got his particulars and I think it's a good place to start. Yeah. Why don't... Well, we'll have a meeting tomorrow morning, 9:00. Okay, great, thanks. Geez, honey... So who, uh, who was that guy? Oh, I told you, he was a client. Yeah? What? I saw the guy hugging you. I was just, you know... A little jealous. You are, aren't you? Are you ready to call it a day? Let's go. No, sweetie I have three hours of work left. I can't, sorry. Don't worry. Dinner's in the slow cooker. Okay. Okay? Yeah. All right. I just... See you later. Okay. Okay. Man: Hey, Ruth! Ruth's out sick, down with something. Oh, yeah? Who are you? Noreen. I'm filling in. Don't waste your time going in there. The guy took out a lease but he wasn't there two weeks. I'll be up on nine if you get lonesome on your break. I got a thermos. [ Sighs] [ Door opens] [ Knocking] Hey, you're back. How was Florida? Oh, you know how uncle frank and aunt ida are. Can't put your feet up on anything. Great look. I leave town and you blossom. You doing okay? So tell me, how's it going? Are you having the most incredible time? Yeah... Yeah, I am. I lose a husband and you gain a career, and a wardrobe. Oh, neesie, you were lucky. You just don't know. I know, as devastating as it was it could have been worse. Some of these men and women are left practically destitute with no one to show them how to protect themselves. Maybe you ought to teach a class. [ Chuckles] Maybe I ought to. You know what you look like? One of the lunchroom ladies from when we were in junior high. [ Laughing] You look good. I mean, different. Good different. A lunchroom lady with a mission. Yeah. Hey, babe. Hey, listen, uh... You haven't seen a gold earring in here, have you? Linda Delaney called. She thinks she may have lost it in here when we were looking for her daughter, Tara. Great. She will be very, very happy. Tess: We've all seen it in the movies, right? Somebody's having an affair. Romantic dinners and stolen weekends at some glamorous-looking hideaway presents to die for. Well, let me tell you. Infidelity is not cheap. Even on a real life scale. So, what we have to do if we have that uneasy feeling about our spouses is not to ignore it, which is probably our first inclination but pay attention. Look for clues, gather the evidence. You'll find everything you need to run a basic surveillance you probably already have. From your car to your phone to baby monitors, even your pet. [ Laughter] I'm not kidding. Saying you're looking for your dog can come in handy when you're caught someplace you're not supposed to be. [ Laughter] A very nice speech. Thank you. That was very good. Tess. Oh, Sally. Excuse me one second. Sally. Yeah. I wasn't sure you'd come. I wasn't either, but you were great. You're becoming quite the pro, Tess McCall. I want another chance, Sally. I'm better at it now. I think I can help you. I was going through building leases and I found an office lease in Jason's name. For Asian-pacific imports? No. He'd already cleared out. But I found a receipt that might mean something. Uh... happy bottom? That bastard. Oh, my god. Sally: That's what he used to call me. Sally! Look what I found! What? I.d.s! Driver's license from three different states. Jason ferrell... laszlo sperling Benjamin Randall. Who the hell is this man? Yes! Hey! Hey!hi, mom. Hi, sweetie. Did you remember those... Binoculars, yeah. Where are they? In the trunk, I'll get them later. Okay. [ Craig and Josh joking] [ Ball bouncing, scuffling] [ Dribbling ball] Craig: Whoa! Good boy! "Big bopper"? Hey, big bopper! Want to bop on in here a minute? Placing personal ads is just part of your job? Is that what you're trying to say? No, that's what I amsaying. It's for an investigation-- a murder investigation. If you don't believe me, why don't you call Matthew? Now, Tess, this is my job. This is what I do. This is what it's always been. I'm not doing something different now. I've never known you to do this before. Yes, you have. You just haven't realized what it's entailed. Now, honey, you have no reason to be suspicious. All right? You're right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just... It's me. It's my imagination. The job. I'm sorry. "Big bopper." [ Laughing] [ Laughing] [ Shutter clicking] Allo? Allo? Sophie? Allo? Hi, sweetie. I didn't expect you till dinner tonight. I know, we decided to leave early because I have some news. Oh, no! It's nothing bad. I got into the sorbonne. Oh, Sophie, that's... Oh, honey, that is great! For the whole junior year, if I want it. Oh, "if you want it." Of course you do. Oh, sweetheart, I'm so proud of you. Thanks, mom. [ Dog barks] So, if you don't want to go could someone younger and smarter than you take your place? When do you have to let them know about it? By the end of the month. Well, if you don't want to go don't worry about disappointing US. It's your decision. This is not about US. Right, mom? Daddy, it's not that I don't want to go. It's just, I'm confused. I'm sorry, but the logic here is... There is no logic here. Can I be excused from this? Or am I being punished? Why don't you help me clear the table? [ Whispers]: Sure thing, mom. Craig? [ Panting] Oh, god. Oh, god, mom. Oh, my god. Oh, dear god. I'm sorry. Sophie: We were... How dare you. Mrs. McCall... Out. What? Get out! Mother! Get out of my house, now! You don't have to go. Sophie! Just wait. Sophie! What is the matter with you? I can't believe you... You are out of control. You are the one who is out of control. Sophie, stop it! Because you are not a child. Then stop treating me like one! Sophie! [ Door slamming] Hey, babe. I walked in on your daughter and Brett in the middle of... Of what? They were having sex, Craig, in our house. And it's not appropriate behavior, and she knows that. Oh, don't patronize me. You always do that. I'm sorry. You don't even know you're doing it anymore. Tess, Tess, I said I'm sorry. God, it's been a long, hard night, you know. She's in the house, she's safe. It could be a lot worse. Let's get into this in the morning. In case you haven't noticed, it is morning. Why are you trying to pick a fight with me? This is what you've been doing lately. What is this about? When you just disappear... That's what I'm talking about. Disappear? I don't disappear. You know that. I get called, I get paged. Is some... Is there something going on with you... That I need to know about? Yeah. Yeah, there is. You know what? I don't like you in this job. And I don't think I ever will. I don't like how it makes you. Now, Tess, honey, it's like you're obsessed. You're obsessed. You are. I love you. I know. I know that. Let's just... Try and get some sleep. Tess: Hey, how's the job? Hmm. You just started, it's going to take time. I don't know that I'll ever be inspired. I found Jason ferrell, he's in Seattle. You did, how? Through those I.D.S. He's living there under the name of Benjamin Randall. I'm going there in a few days. I wish I could go, too. Denise? I think Craig's seeing somebody. You don't seem shocked. Nothing shocks me anymore. I just have this... Oh, I know. That's how it starts. I need to know, or I just need it to all go away. If you think you have reason to suspect him then you have to run a thorough investigation. Just like you would anyone else. This is the receiver for the r.F. Camera. Great. Um, what about that two-way phone recorder? It starts when any phone in the house is used and stops automatically when it's hung up. F.c.c.-approved. I'll take that, too. TV announcer: Hamilton dribbling down the court... [ Phone rings] ...passes to paterson. Paterson stops, fakes passes to Anderson, Anderson drives puts it up, over! And the score is 65-67. Hello? Oh, hey, how you doing? ...downcourt to Pierce, Pierce to earnest earnest moves around, passes to kerner. Kerner puts it up, blocked. [ Chuckling] Washington breaks into the three-two offense. Hamilton passes to Crosby Crosby comes back to paterson... Oh, hey, thanks, babe. I'm going to Seattle tomorrow on a job. I may be gone for several days. Oh. Who was on the phone? That was, um, Matthew. ...remaining, third quarter. Turner takes from Washington, passes to kerner kerner dribbles around, passes to Turner... to Pearson Pearson to pryor, pryor looks around... [ TV barely audible] ...scores! [ Crowd cheering] [ Rewinds tape] Matthew: I want 50 bucks now. Yeah, I did, I did, I saw it. I've been playing the same game as the last... [ Clicks off] Announcer: 71-69. [ Sighs] [ Whistle blowing] Boy: Daddy, daddy! [ Laughing] Hi, sweetheart. Have a nice day? The dry cleaner called. They won't have your suit till tomorrow-- is that okay? Boy: Come on, dad. Wife: Here we go. Boy: Thanks. I want to push the button. Uh, yes... uh Benjamin Randall, please. You'll have to give them a moment. Mrs. Randall and their kids just went up. [ Phone rings] Door. Mm-hmm. Wife and kids? Statements from two banks where he opened accounts with your money. [ Laughing] Oh, no. [ Continues laughing] A wife? Do the kids look like him? I suppose... Yes. [ Catching breath] Sally, we should go see your attorney. We should do it right away. Yeah. [ Sobs] Can we do this tomorrow, please? [ Crickets chirping] [ Rewinds tape] Woman: Hi, it's Linda. Craig: Hey. So, guess what I did tonight? What? Sold my tenth car. Really? Cool. Was he good-looking? Oh-ho! You're so bad. You're going to pay for that, you know. Really? Uh-huh. Is that a problem? [ Both laughing] So, uh, we're still on for tomorrow, right? Yeah. 7:00? Room 116. Room 116. [ Door opens] [ Clicks machine off] Hey, babe, you're back. I finished early. Hey... Did you have a good trip? Yeah. I'm running late. I got to pick up Matty. Spence is being transferred to the second precinct. So we're throwing a little party for him. That's why I'm scarfing down a hot dog. You don't mind if I go, do you? No, of course not. I'm going to bed early anyway. So, did you get the bad guys? Yeah. Cool. [ Quietly]: You don't know it yet, but, yeah. [ Faucets squeaking] [ Shower running] [ Dog barking in distance] [ Thunder rumbling] [ Beeping] Radio announcer: We're high atop the radio towers overlooking lake erie. It's music into the night.

The toilet in the guest room is broken, did I tell you? You have to jiggle it every time you flush. Want me to call them? I'm just not quite sure what to tell them. Well, just what you told me. You have to jiggle it. What, you want me to call them? No, I will. Well, if you want me to, just say so. No, I said I would. Fine. Call. Oh, whoa-whoa-- lunch. Keep going. You're going to be late. Bye, mom. Bye, sweetie. Bye, dad. See you after school. Bye. Bye, sweetheart. Have a good day. I had some files. Did you see them? No. You sure? Of course. Why would I see them? 'Cause sometimes you see them. Are you saying I go through your things...? 'Cause I don't. Yeah, you do. Why would I...? If I wanted to see your stupid files I could do it without you even knowing it. [ Chuckles] Yeah, sure. All right. I'll see you. Tess: Copies of bank statements... Marriage certificates, I.D.S... And photos. God, I can't believe this was going on and I was completely blind to it! Hell of a job, Tess. You and I need to get together sometime. My friend could use an investigator with your kind of fortitude. I'll call the d.A.'S office. Sally: Thanks. A hell of a job, Tess, he's right. Thank you. [ Patting on back] Hey, babe. [ Softly]: Hey... listen. I'm sorry about this morning. I am, I was a real jerk. I'll call the plumber. I'll take care of everything, babe. I'm so sorry. Hey... Remember when we used to do this, huh? I'd come home for lunch. [ Whispers]: Hey... Why don't you let me take this off? Honey? I... I have to meet Denise. What? Well... Call her and tell her you can't make it. Hey... [ Sighs] Everything I tell women to look for it's now happening to me. And I think it's been going on for a really long time, neese. I just didn't want to see it. Tess... I haven't ever said anything, but... Craig at Laurel's wedding. I walked in on him and Connie carpenter. Her bridesmaid? So? What do you mean? In a bedroom. You've known about this, for... Five years...! And you've kept it a secret? I-I-I... kept it a secret? I just didn't... I couldn't tell you. How dare you tell me now! How dare you even talk to me! Tess! [ Sighs] Would you like me to fix you something to eat before you go? I'd be happy to. I know you would, mother. I'll probably just stop for something on the way. Anyway, I'm sure Brett will be too mortified to show his face in here. [ Sighs] Mom... What? What? [ Choked up]: It's nothing. I'm sorry. Oh... You always do this. You always say, "nothing." No, I don't. [ Chuckles] Yes, you do, believe me. You always deny stuff. The obvious. Yeah. Oh, soph... You get to be my age and... And you think you're grown and you have it all figured out and I have so much to figure out. So is this, uh, a mid-life thing or something? Oh, god, I hope not yet. [ Both laugh] I am so... Proud of you. Yeah... Guess I'm pretty proud of you, too... Mommy. I trust you, soph. I hope you know that. Yeah, I do. I do, mommy. Whatever you decide to do, okay? I may rant or rave, but... I'll support you, all right? Yeah, I know. Okay. [ Chuckles] Tess [with French accent]: Mrs. Delaney... Please-- Linda. It's so luxurious. Sinfully. So, are you from here? No, I'm from back east. Miss it? Well, my daughter's with me and that helps and there's this guy I'm seeing. Ah... that must help, too. Well, no man's ever treated me as well as he treats me. Then you are lucky. Well, I'm not that lucky-- he's married. Well... You never know. In this case I'm afraid I do know. Sorry. Even if he wasn't married, this guy... I get the feeling that I'm not the first. Our relationship is what it is. As long as we're in room 116 it's a relationship. I'm sorry to go on. You want to take this for a test drive? Woman: Hiya, Tess, he's out on call right now. Uh... Tess? Is he with you? He's out with captain popkin-- a robbery over in chaney. Tess, what is it? You tell me. You don't know? No, I don't. There are names and dates and little stars by the names... As if he rates them. Women's names. This doesn't have anything to do with your personal ads case. Oh, Tess, you guys have been my friends for a long, long time, both of you have... And this goes back a long, long time, doesn't it? Doesn't it, this, this... Juggling women, that's what he's doing, isn't it? Oh, Matthew, don't worry, you don't have to say anything. 'Cause you just told me. Tess, god, I, I... Matthew, I'd appreciate it if you didn't get involved in this. Parker said you were here. Tess...? I have nothing to say to you. Oh, yeah, you do, don't get defensive. I haven't done anything against you. Yes, you have, you conspired with him. Conspired?! I ought to beat the crap out of you. I can still do it, you know. I don't know what the hell else you'd call it. If I was conspiring, I was conspiring with you. You wanted, needed to believe that he was a certain way and I only wanted you to be happy, so I believed it, too. I would never hurt you. You're right, I did want him... Decent, I wanted him to be decent. And that's where I went wrong. Tess... I made it so easy for him. I did. I was so willing to believe, to accept anything to make it all right. Maybe when you talk to him... You need to talk to him. It's over, Denise. It's over. I'm not ever, ever going back. I don't want to. [ Dialing phone] What are you going to do? [ Phone ringing] Hi, sweetheart. Listen, I, uh, have to go back to Seattle. I may be gone for a couple of days. I know. Could you pick up Josh from school? No, I already checked with Denise and she's working. But she said she can probably keep him tomorrow afternoon. All right then. Great. Love you, too. [ Click] Bastard. You want to close out your joint account? No, no, I want you to leave just ten dollars in it and then transfer the rest to a new account. Fine, no problem. [ Horns honking] [ Beeping] Man: Hi. How can I help you? [ With southern accent]: Yeah, I'd like a room, please. All right-- for one night? [ Phone rings] Excuse me. Newton motel, good afternoon. Yeah, we're on highway 101, just south of the lake. Just south of the lake, that's right. Uh, excuse me, what happened to the liquor store on the corner? They moved. They did? Just one block down. Okay, thanks. Hi. All right. Sorry about that. No, it's all right. Is it possible to get room 117? 117, uh... Not a problem. Thank you. [ Laughter on TV] [ Laughter on TV, water running] [ Whirring] [ Whirring continues] [ Traffic roaring] [ TV playing] [ Door closes] Craig: Hey! Woman: Is that a big... Bad policeman? [ Craig laughing] [ Growling playfully] Listen, listen. What? I can't stay long. Woman: What do you mean you can't stay long? Craig: I have to run. I have to pick up my son. Your son? Oh. Wow, I bet you're a really terrific father, huh? [ Kissing, heavy breathing] [ Traffic roaring] [ Canned TV laughter] [ Heavy breathing] [ Kissing] [ Truck roaring] [ Craig, woman panting] [ Traffic roaring] [ Both laughing] Listen, don't worry about me, okay? I'll just, um... Get a cab. You have no money? Craig: No, I don't. I'm going to have to stop by an a.T.M. Here, come on. Get in the car. Excuse me. [ Beeping] [ Traffic roaring] [ Sirens wailing] Oh, damn! Woman: What's going on? I'm going to drive you home, okay? The machine must not be working. ...leave a message after the beep. Hey, Denise. It's Craig, listen... Ooh! I was hoping you'd be there and that Josh'd be with you. Uh, I got to school kind of late... It's all locked up. Um... I'm going to head home. So... uh, I'll give you a call from there. Is that dad? No. Don't think so. Sounds like dad on the phone. Hello? You there? Your shot. Man on TV: Later or early tomorrow. Woman on TV: Well, what is it? Hey, Josh? Sorry I missed you at school, buddy. Man: ...Spoil the surprise. You'll love it, though. I've been running late all day. Did you catch the bus, or, uh... Woman: Let's go in the bedroom... Woman 2: ...A big, bad policeman? [ Canned laughter] [ Craig growling playfully] Craig: ...My son. Man: One of these days! Woman: Wow, I bet you're a really terrific father, huh? Craig: Yeah. [ Kissing, heavy breathing] Woman: Give me your handcuffs. [ Craig laughing] [ Both laughing] [ Canned laughing on TV] [ Craig and woman laughing louder] We're just getting to the good part. Tess, turn it off, come on. Now! No. Not yet. I'm doing you a favor, Craig. It's a private showing. So you know just what to expect in court. I don't believe this. What? That I did this? Or that I caught you? Oh, go ahead. Take it. I have a copy. [ Laughs nervously] All right, you caught me. Babe. I mean, you know come on... It, it, it's nothing. I'm an idiot, I'm an idiot. Uh, it, I'm a jerk. I mean, it's over. You know? It will never happen... again. What?! [ Crashing] Say something! I don't have to say something. I'm listening to you... Babe. I don't even have to ask you what her name is 'cause what I don't know about her I can find out. I'm outta here. Oh, no, I'm not through with you yet. I have the dates, the times, the names of the others... I can trace your infidelity back as far... Tess, you made your point, okay. No, I took vows, Craig... I took them seriously. All right? And you betrayed me. Tess, come on. Tess, you mean everything to me. I've provided for you. I've always been here for you. I gave, I gave you 20 years of my life and you looked me in the eyes and you lied to me and you betrayed me. And I... [ Sobs] I don't deserve this. To be treated like this, I don't deserve it. Get out. Please, just... Tess... Go, please. [ Sighing] Did you know that the porch light was out? Uh-uh. I changed it. Did you? Thank you, sweetheart. Hey, you want to do something special this weekend? We can drive up and visit Sophie at school? Bet there'd be a basketball game on. Just me and you? Um..., or Denise, maybe, if you like. Or not. [ Knocking] Hi. I... do you mind if... [ Door shuts] Oh, sorry, I caught you in the middle of dinner, huh? Would you care for something? Are you hungry? Uh, no, no, no I ate. Please... sit down. I just... Stopped by to see how you guys were doing. How's school? Sucks, as usual. Did you turn in that science project yet? When is that due? It was due last Friday, except... I can turn it in this week. Mr. Evans is cool. Well, I don't want you to get points taken off because you're late. I won't. Well, yeah, but... What do you care! Josh! Josh! Hey, Josh. Hey, buddy. Come here. I'm sorry, buddy. I'm so sorry. [ Sighs] [ People applauding] Kenny: Welcome back to the show. I'm really excited to have this next guest. She's back again. Please, give a warm welcome to our very own Tess McCall. [ Cheering and applause] Hi, Tess, welcome back. Kenny: Tess is an advocate for those whose spouses cheat on them stealing away the assets of the marriage not to mention the years of devotion. Tess, last time you told US how you started your business what you learned and you talked about fidelity infidelity... And our audience really responded to that. And I got to tell you, that surprised me. Yes, it does seem to strike a chord, unfortunately. Tess, isn't part of what you do... Well, some would say, it's about revenge. Oh, no! Oh, no, it's not all. I mean, I think sometimes in the beginning it's about... Fear of abandonment, or it's about jealousy... but, but... But I really think, mostly, this is about love and respect. Respect for what was. The life you built together, all the things you vowed you'd be for each other, no matter what. Finally... It's about respect for yourself. Because what's done cannot be undone. And it's how you live with it that really matters. I mean, how you get on with your life... because, believe me life does go on. [ Cheering and applause] [ People talking] Tess: Hey! Hi, sweetie. Where were you? I know, it took forever, didn't it? Come on, quick, quick, quick. Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. It's okay, I'm just glad you're here. We saw the show, you were great. Thank you, thank you. Oh, I'm so nervous. Are you? It's like I'm going with you. Part of me is, actually. Listen. Nothing's changed with Brett and I. I just wanted you to know that. And I also want you to know that I realize how important this trip is. And that I have to take care of myself. Oh, baby, I'm so proud you're my daughter. Woman on P.A.: ...Please report to gate 52. Hey! Come here. Give me a hug. Okay. This is it. Yeah? I love you guys. Love you, too. I'm going to miss you. Take care. Bye, Denise. Bye, have a great trip. You be good, okay? Okay. Bye. Okay. Good-bye. Sorry. Bye. Josh? Brett: Hey, guys. Josh! Promised me popcorn. Wait up. Well, she's out of the nest... I guess. I guess so. It's weird. We've done all the damage we can do, huh? Listen, Tess... I think, no... Look, what happened wasn't just you, okay? It was me, too. Anyway, I'm okay. I just want to get on with my life. I never realized you had it in you. You know? I know you didn't. ♪ ♪
