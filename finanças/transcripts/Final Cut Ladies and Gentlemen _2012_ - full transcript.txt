- FINAL CUT - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN You talkin' to me, mothafucka! This has got to be a dream. Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for the slight delay. A technical problem. Someone have a bellyache? Here. Let me show you. Everything all right? I expected to find this room overcrowded with the theatre full of people at your feet. Oh, it's you? How do you do? How do you do? I saw that in a nickelodeon once and I always wanted to do it. What's your name? - Masha. - Masha? It's quite nice. Your mother left you a very beautiful name, Epiphany. My friends call me, Catherine. I am Prince Vlad of Sz?kely. You look absolutly beautiful. Well, where shall we go? A movie, dinner... Tonight, we celebrate! I get bread from back home. I get fish from California. And you can always tell a great kitchen like ours because of the milk-fed veal. That's the secret. See, milk-fed veal is pure white. Out here they got that pink veal. Slide over, honey. Pull out! Welcome to my home. Do you like lemon meringue pie? I don't know... I make you some tomorrow. Well, it was very nice meeting you, Angela. Good night, Vikomt! I knew, you'd come. - Where are you taking me? - Just a harmless little walk. I'm beginning to like you, Mr. Bond. Oh... call me James. More than anyone I've met in a long time, James. What on earth are we going to do about it? You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life. I happen to like nice men. - I'm nice men. - No, you're not. You're... I feel great about it. Feel me. Why did you not tell me that you were virgin? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. That's right. We end up together. And this is the most romantic day of my whole life. And if we don't... then I am a complete slut. Did you enjoy it, didn't you? When we were making love, you just about take me right over that rainbow. We'll have to get married, you know. What? The thing is, I think is quite possible that we were born for each other. Yes, you're someone I could imagine having children with. - Really? - Yeah. Hit the lights. Turn 'em out again. We'll trade fours. Who is this fuck? Go away! So here we are. The ladies with me. Leave her alone! She does not like you. Can't you see it? Darling, don't be jealous! You're resting big boy, huh? We needed to find closure. This time, I assure you, I won't be coming back. You can go to hell! Get out! From now on we're done! Om! I'm sorry. - I didn't know... - It's ok, it's ok. Leo Johnson is history. Understand? I'm taking care of you from now on. Will you marry me? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, yes, yes... Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God and in the face of this company, to join together this Man and this Woman in holy matrimony. What God has united, let no man tear asunder. You are married. Kiss my ass. You won't be any good of that. Regina! What way you talk? I give her one year... My bunch of flowers! Wait! Farewell! Now what we're gonna do? We're gonna shoot the works. Whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels, the oldest champagne, the richest caviar, the hottest music, and the prettiest wife! Wow! That does it! Days, months, and years go by. I shouldn't tell you that. What? I saw your wife yesterday. And? She's met someone else. I'm sure they are just friends. I thought you should know it. That's none of your business. It's nice being married, yeah? - Hello Howard? - Mrs. Woodhouse? - Dr. Hill? - Congratulations! - Really? - Really. - Are you there? - Oh, yes. - Can you drop by into mine? - Yes, yes, I will. Thank you. Bye. Pepe Marcos! Is there Ivan? Wait, please. Tesu! Tesu! It's your wife. Ilonka? Good morning to you, Mr. Hello! How are you? You dingleberry, I, uh, told you not to call me here when I'm working. What? I need to stay longer at work. I work overtime. I don't think I can get home before 9 or 10. I'm not so happy about that. And you will please not call again! So I did a test and it turns out that I am pregnant. I can't. My head is throbbing. - Oh, you got a headache? - I have a headache. - Bad? - Like Oswald and ghosts. Good day! Dr. Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling. Come in! Take a seat! I see what I can do and I check you all. Oh, shit. Should I undress now? His eyes upon your face. His hand upon your hand. His lips caress your skin. It's more than I can stand. Why does my heart cry? Feelings I can't fight! You're free to leave me but Just don't deceive me! And please believe me when I say... I love you! Welcome home Mr. Bailey! I could use a drink. Yes, some scotch. With water, no ice. What's wrong? I am Addison DeWitt. I am nobody's fool least of all yours. Why are you saying this? You are my dear... are a slut. I am not! Stop crying. It's not going to work anymore. Fuck you! I felt like this is the end of my life, my love, and my beauty. THE WORLD IS YOURS Why did you come here? I was in the neighbourhood and I thought to come and see you. - Is there anything wrong? - No, nothing. Come inside! Let's talk. Come on in! And the bar set up. How about a drink? No, thank you. And now dear, if you just sit here... I do love you, you know. The way it used to be. Something... crossed over in me. I can't go back. Why can't anything ever be perfect once? What shall I do, Prudence? We are women. Our choices are never easy. My lovely girl! If he released you... my dear child, you must go. EXCELLENT CAREERS FOR EXCELLENT YOUNG MEN WAR DECLARED! I do now, of my own free will... after having been duly advised and warned... of the meaning and consequences of this oath... enrol in the Federal Service for not less than two years... and as much longer as may be required... by the needs of the Federation. Yes, Drill Sergeant! Today what we gonna do, marching up and down on the square. I'll call you as soon as I get the results. Id like to do a general examination just to know something more. Let's see how far along from here... And an arm... There is your baby. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6... Comrades! Earthshakers! Show them! Paul! Horror. I had always heard your entire life flashes in front of your eyes the second before you die. Man's attitude goes some ways. The way his life will be. It is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream. When you have something like a nightmare, you will wake up and tell yourself that it was only a dream. It is said that the world we live in is not a bit different from this. Your suffering is over. Now you will find peace for eternity. - Here you are. That's for you. - For me? I'm going to swoon. Never, oh! never, nothing will die. The stream flows, the wind blows, The cloud fleets, The heart beats. Nothing will die. Open your eyes! Open your eyes! Open your eyes! Open your eyes! Hello! Hello honey! It's me. It's your voice. Are you alive? For me you are the best. Yes, Elena, you're my last thought before I fall asleep... and the first when I wake up. I dream of you every night. I'm terrible happy. When can I see you again? Meet me at the city car park in one hour. Ok, I'll be there. It says it's the chance for lifetime. We have each other. That's all it matters. Yes. I can't live without you. I'm going to have a child.
