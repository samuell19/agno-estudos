[TAPE REWINDING] [BEEP] WOMAN: Mary? Marsha. Private sale at Maxfield's on Saturday. Doors open at 9:00. Bring plastic. Bye. [BEEP] MAN: Hi, beautiful, it's Andy. Don't worry, I'm not cancelling. I just, uh, want to ask you something. Actually, I just want to talk to you. As a matter of fact, I love talking to you and seeing you and... Call me. [BEEP] MAN: Hi, Mary. This is Richard. I'm in your apartment... And I'm going to kill you. -I love you. -[GASPING] [BELL RINGS] Ready? I'm ready. The question is, is Mr. Wonderful ready? Look what I did, Tom and me on our date last night. So you let him get to first base, huh? Did he use his tongue? C'mon. We gotta move our butts. I gotta baby-sit. GIRL: Hurry up and close the door, somebody. Why? -Whoa! Rad shoes! -They're my mom's. I can't believe she lets you borrow her stuff. Why not? She always borrows my clothes. Can you imagine my mother borrowing my stuff? [CHUCKLES] Your mom looks like what a mom is supposed to look like. GIRL: God, how can you guys even read about the candlelight killer? Did you bring the film this time? Yeah, but are you sure he'll be there? I gotta be home by 4:00. You'll get home in time. We were too late yesterday. That's why we missed him. Wend, you're lopsided. [ENGINE ROARS] -WOMAN: Stop! -[TIRES SCREECH] Look! I got it! Come on! What... What, are you guys crazy? Hey! [PHONE RINGS] Good afternoon, designs by Katherine. Hi, Sarah. Oh, hi, Lis! Your mom just stepped out. How'd your date go last night? [MIRTHLESS CHUCKLE] Not my type. Nice, though. A handsome hunk of a man, too. It just didn't click. You should pass him on to my mom. Yeah, that'll be the day. So, who are you in love with this week? Oh, I don't know. Maybe George Michael. Beyond cute, huh? [GIGGLING] Yeah, you better watch out for those guys who bleach their hair and wear earrings. He does not bleach his hair. Ha ha ha! I wish you two my best. Look, I'd better go. Could you tell my mom that I was home, I picked up the dry cleaning, and I'm going over to Wendy's? Mmm, check-in noted. I'll talk to you tomorrow, kiddo. Okay? Bye-bye. Hi, guy, what's up? Oh, you just missed Lisa. I swear, that little girl is going to break some hearts. What'd she say? Oh, she's got a new guy. A boy at school? Ha ha! No. George Michael. Ha ha ha! Oh, stop looking so worried. She's just a kid. [BUZZER] [DOOR OPENS] What do you want? Ralph, tell Wendy I'm here. Wendy's not here. She's dead. I killed her. [SCARY VOICE] I'm the candlelight killer. Get screwed, Ralph. Wendy! WENDY: Ralph, get out of here! Come on! I just got the number of the DMV in Culver City. We haven't used them yet. [BOTH GIGGLE] [INTERCOM BUZZES] Adams. Vehicle I.D. [SEXY VOICE] Hello, is this the supervisor? Yes, ma'am. What can I do for you? I've spoken to several people who work under you, and they've all said that they didn't have the authority to help me out. That's why I've asked to speak to someone of your stature. That's usually the case, ma'am. What can I do for you? Well, you see, somebody hit my car while it was parked. Hit and run's a police matter, doesn't come under this department. Oh, no, no. It wasn't hit and run. The gentlemen who did it was very considerate, and he left me a note with his name, telephone number, and a sweet apology. But guess what? I lost the note. I, uh, I don't see how I can help you. Well, the one thing I do... You little dick-face! Excuse me? You little brat! Get out of here! Are you still there? Get outta here! Uh, yes, yes. That was... That was my secretary. Um, as I was saying, the one thing I do remember from the note was the license plate number. It was one of those personalized plates. It was "want more." Could you please run that for me? "W-N-T M-O-R-E." [WHISPERS] Does he have it? [TAPS KEYBOARD] I'm sorry, I can't do that. I suggest you call the police. Okay. Mr. Adams, let me be really honest with you... I haven't told you the whole story. It wasn't my car. It was my friend's car. I borrowed it, and when she sees her car and she sees this dent, it'll be like... Like a death in the family. Ha ha ha ha! Oh, you know, I would really like to help you out, but... Mr. Adams, I understand the pressures on a man in your position, but no one will ever have to know. If I hadn't lost the note, I never would have had to call you. Uh... [TAPPING KEYBOARD] All right. Thank you, Mr. Adams. You really made my day. [BOTH SHRIEK WITH DELIGHT] Thank you, Magnum P.I. And my parents say we don't learn anything from TV. You know, Lisa, we could totally be private eyes if we wanted to. So what's my stud muffin's name? Robert Travis. Call him. No. You call him. No way, Lisa. I mean, you sound just like your mom. I sound like a kid. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Oh, hi. Um, how'd you get my number? [WHISPERS] Friday night? Yeah. Yeah, sure, that sounds fun. Lisa? Eric wants to go out with Lisa? [WHISPERING] Um, well... I'll, I'll talk to her. Okay? Okay. Call me back. Bye. Oh, my God, Lisa! This is so unbelievable! I cannot believe it. That was Nick Rivaldi calling. He called to ask me out! He asked me out, I have my first date! And Eric wants to go out with you, too, which means we can double! This is so exciting! Yeah, just make the plans for two years from Friday night. You don't have to tell your mom. You could just tell her you were coming over here to spend the night. Yeah, and then she talks to your mom and I'm dead. Besides, I can't lie to her. We tell each other everything. You don't tell her about the scrapbook and following guys. She doesn't have to know about that. That's not for real. Lisa, come on. I cannot believe your mother's really serious about the 16 thing. She's so cool about everything else. She lets you swear, wear her clothes... She treats you like a best friend. Lisa, you really gotta deal with her. Because if you have to wait till you're 16 to date, everybody's gonna think you're weird. Lis. Lissie. [BEEPS] [CRYING SOFTLY] [DOG BARKS IN DISTANCE] Hi, guy, I'm home! Uh-oh, a locked door. Let's see, it's not report card time... George Michael didn't get married, did he? Honey? Uh-oh. Serious, huh? Want to talk about it? No? I'll tell you what. Why don't you and I make some dinner? And I'll let you peel the onions since your eyes are already red. Okay? [SIGHS] [ONIONS SIZZLE] KATHERINE: ...only I don't know who the hell I'm talkin' to, right? So he said, "You don't remember me, do ya?" What'd you say? I said, "Uh, well, I'm not sure." And he said, "What, there's so many men "in your life you can't remember me?" Now I'm getting angry. But I don't want to insult him in case he's a customer. So he says, "Well, if you don't remember me, "I'm gonna hang up and I'll call you back. "If you remember me, you call me back." So did you ever find out who it was? Yeah, it was this guy Bob, a customer. And he's usually really nice, but this was so annoying. Didn't sound annoying. Sounds fun. Is he cute? Um...kind of. Has he ever asked you out? [CHUCKLES] What's the difference? When am I gonna have time? I got a daughter to raise, I got a business to run... Wendy got asked out on a date today. Oh. Is that what all the tears were about? And the guy who asked her out has a friend who wanted to take me out. Tomorrow night. What did Wendy say? Wendy said yes. And what did you say? I said that I couldn't, and Wendy said that everybody's gonna think I'm weird. Well, I'll tell you what. I'll make you a great big button that says, "I'm not weird, my mom is." Okay? Very funny. Oh, shit. Forgot to put on the rice. Great, no rice. -I'll put on my shoes and go. -I'll go. Honey, it's dark out. Mom, it's only 7:30, and you let me go last week. Okay, okay. You better hurry, though, or I'm gonna have to start this all over again. You better get minute rice, honey, or we're not gonna eat till midnight. My purse is by the answering machine. Take $10 and my keys, with the mace. Psst! Psst! Psst! Lisa, how's Momma? I haven't seen her for a couple of days. She's fine. Oh, would you tell her we just got in some peppered brie? The kind she likes. Yeah. [DOOR CLOSES] [LOUD BARKING] [BARKING CONTINUES] Unh! oh! Are you okay? Is someone chasing you, honey? Do you know how to talk? [GIGGLING] Yeah. Well, I should, I'm 14 years old. Fourteen, no way! Come on, you're at least 16. Oh, are these yours? Yeah. Thanks. Let's pick up your groceries, huh? Thanks. Mmm-hmm. Is that everything? Yeah. Are you sure? 'Cause I know my mom would have killed me if I'd lost something on the way home. Mine wouldn't. Really? Well... You're a lucky kid. Okay, take care. Oh. Watch where you're going. [CAR ALARM CHIRPS] [CAR STARTS] [DOOR OPENS] KATHERINE: Honey, would you start the water again? I'm on the phone. Okay. KATHERINE: Thanks for going. No problem. Mom, I want to go out on that date. Of course you do. You're just gonna have to trust that I know what's best. Mom, you're always saying that I'm smart. And I am smart. I'm as smart as any 16-year-old. People always tell me that I look like I'm 16. But, honey, you're not. Look, I know you think that two years is a really long time, but you need it. You need it to learn about yourself. I wish I had taken the time. You know, Mom, dating does not necessarily mean getting pregnant. [SIGHS] No, it doesn't. But it... It does mean a whole set of problems that you are not emotionally ready to handle. Honey, I was 14 once, too. I wanted it all, I wanted it really fast. Lisa, I will never, ever regret having you. But I do regret not taking more time before I moved into an adult world. I'm not gonna let you make that mistake. I won't allow it. You're not being fair. You've always said that I have a say in everything. Why don't I have a say in this? You're having a say. We're talking about it. We're discussing it. It doesn't mean it's gonna turn out in your favor. [SIGHS] Honey... You're 14. Don't wish your life away. You're gonna have plenty of time to experience everything you want, I promise. [SIGHS] Can we eat? [SIGHS] [LOVE MACHINEPLAYING ON CAR RADIO] Earth to Lisa. Oh, God, that was awful. You looked like you were having fun. Fun? Do you know what it's like having to watch every word you say so you don't sound like a total geek? And in the middle of a sentence trying to remember if you put on lip gloss or not? I'm a nervous wreck. Where's he taking you? To the movies. Lisa, we are going to be sitting in the dark for two hours. What if he tries something? His reputation... So don't go. But I want to go. I just don't want to go without you. Come on, don't you want to go out with Eric? [HUFFS] Are you kidding? He's gorgeous. Not compared to the guy I met last night. What guy? Wendy, last night I met the most beautiful man you have ever seen. "Met"? Or "saw"? Met. We had a conversation. He thought I was 16. Really? What's his name? I don't know. But I got his license plate number, so I can always get his name. And then what? Who knows? Maybe we'll fall in love. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Hello? Is this Rick? Yes. Hi, guy. It's been a long time. How are you? I'm fine. How long has it been? You don't remember who I am, do you? I'm not sure. What? There are so many women in your life that you can't remember me? Talk some more. [GIGGLES] MAN: Alison! Alison? [BANGING ON DOOR] Alison, are you in there? Say, uh, excuse me. Do you live on this street? Not far. Why? Do you happen to know the lady who lives here, her name's Alison? No, I'm sorry, I don't. [SULTRY VOICE] No, that's not where I know you from. Guess again. You're disguising your voice, aren't you? That's why I can't place you. No, Rick. This is my voice. You think about it, and I'll call you later. No, wait... [LAUGHING] Hi, Mrs. Marks. Is Wendy there? Oh. Nick already picked her up? No, that's okay. I'll talk to her tomorrow. Bye. -[DOOR OPENS] -Lis? Hi, honey. [SCOFFS] Oh, what? Not only am I too young to date, I'm too young to have a little privacy? [SIGHS] Sorry. I didn't say you could come in. Well, excuse me. I just came to see if you were hungry. I already ate. Oh. Gee, that's too bad. I stopped at the market and I got some Cokes, and I ordered a pizza with everything on it, just like you like it. Maybe later. Mom... ...is it okay if Wendy sleeps over here tomorrow night instead of me over there? Um... Sure. [DOOR CLOSES] Ready for lunch? Sure am. That's gonna look great. Oh, thanks. Have fun! Oh, sweetheart, I'm gonna have to cancel our date for tonight. [LAUGHING] I'm not counting, but that's, what? One, two, three... I know, I know. I'm sorry. It's just that the plan's changed. Lisa was supposed to spend the night at Wendy's house, but instead, Wendy's gonna stay at our house. -Katherine. -Yes? Can I ask you a question? Sure. Why are you treating me like we're having an illicit affair instead of a relationship? I mean, stop breaking dates with me. Invite me over. It's complicated. It doesn't have to be. But it is. [LAUGHS] You have no idea what it's like having a 14-year-old daughter. When I come home, she's wearing my lipstick. If I go on a diet, she goes on a diet. If she even thought I was sleeping with somebody, she might think it was all right for her. Look, I don't have to stay over, I can just show up. You can introduce us. Maybe I'd like her. Maybe she'd like me. I know she'd like you. Maybe she would come to understand that she wasn't the only one who loved you. I just think she'd get very attached to you. [SIGHS] But I've dated a woman with children before. They liked you? Yes. Do you still see them? No. No, not since I stopped seeing their mother. That's my point. I can't do that to her. She's not ready for that. [SIGHS] You know, I think it's you that isn't ready. LISA: He's here. Good. I'll go ring his bell and tell him his future wife has arrived. Just kidding. WENDY: So anyway, all through the movie I keep looking over at him to see if he's gonna try anything. He's actually watching the movie. I couldn't believe it. So I figure he'll do it later. We leave, he drives me home, pulls up in front of my house, and he actually starts talking. I couldn't believe it. But I'm still waiting for the big move. So finally, he walks me up to my door. What happened? He just kissed me on the cheek and said good night. [SCOFFS] Wendy, there he is. That's him? God, he's gorgeous! What's he doing wearing a tuxedo in the middle of the day? Who knows? Let's follow him. How the hell are we supposed to get a picture? LISA: Maybe he's late for something. An affair. Modeling assignment. [HORN HONKS] Come on, let's get a closer look! No, no! He'll recognize me! -No! -Come on! Excuse me! He's not a model, he's a waiter. He's not a waiter, he runs the place. Maybe he even owns it! LAX, American Airlines flight information, please. Thanks. [PHONE BEEPS] ANSWERING MACHINE: Judy, this is Laura... Yes, I'd like the status on Flight 76. Yes, from New York. Yeah, I'll hold. MACHINE: ...asked me to remind you about the... -[SIGHS] -[PHONE BEEPS] CHARLIE: [ON RECORD] Judy, hi, it's Charlie. Listen, I'm sorry about what happened... [BEEPS] WOMAN: Judy, remember that dirt we heard about Susan and David? Call me for details. It's on the ground? MAN: Hi, honey, it's me. Don't worry about the airport. I'll just take a cab to your place. See you about 9:30. I miss you. [BEEPS] MAN: Hi, Judy. This is Richard. I'm in your apartment, and I'm going to kill you. [BEEPS] [TAPE REWINDS] [BEEPS] RICHARD: Hi, Judy. This is Richard. I'm in your apartment, and I'm going to kill you. [BEEPS] Hi, Jim. This is Judy. Save your sick jokes for someone who appreciates them. By the way, lose my number. [GASPING] Please... Don't hurt me. I will do whatever you want. Please. Say something. Say something. I love you. [SIGHS] [DOOR CLOSES] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? [CLEARS THROAT] Ah, hello? Hi, guy. Did I wake you? Uh, yeah, I guess so. But it's all right. I, uh... Thought I was coming down with a cold, so I... Took some NyQuil and must have just conked out. [SIGHS] Did you call earlier? I thought I heard the phone ring. I did call earlier. Do you want to go back to sleep? Oh, no, no. No, I've been waiting for your call. I've missed you. You should take some vitamin C and go back to bed, and then I'll call you tomorrow. No, wait a minute. You call, you wake me up, you get me all excited, and you still haven't told me who you are. Don't I even get a clue? Maybe tomorrow. Just... Just one clue. Where do you know me from? [WHISPERS] The restaurant. The restaurant. Oh, the restaurant. So that's how you know me. Go back to bed. I'll call you tomorrow and see how you're feeling. No, don't call. [CLEARS THROAT] Come over. [LAUGHS] I can't. Well, then, give me your number, and I'll call you when I wake up. I can't do that, either. Good night. [BOTH GIGGLE] [TAPE REWINDING] LISA: [ON RECORD] Hello? RICHARD: Ah, hello? LISA: Hi, guy. Did I wake you? [TAPE REWINDS] LISA: Hello? RICHARD: Ah, hello? LISA: Hi, guy. Did I wake you? [WHISPERING] [GIGGLING] Okay, you guys, what's the big secret? Huh? [DOORBELL RINGS] -That's my dad. -I'll let him in. Uh, Kathy? Lisa said you guys are really having no plans for Easter weekend, since you're gonna be working and all, so I think maybe I could stay here with you guys for a while. Well, you know, I mean my parents really want me to go with them to Big Bear 'cause we're opening up the cabin for the summer and everything but I don't really want to go, you know? You don't want to go? No, not really. The first weekend, it's always so dirty, there's spiders everywhere, my brother's such a royal pain in the butt and I figured I'd have more fun here with you guys. And anyways, all the guys are gonna be planning lots of parties and we... Well, Lisa already has plans. She's gonna earn little extra money and help me out at the shop like she usually does. But I don't wanna do that. -Knock, knock. -Hi, Mr. Marks. -WENDY: Hi, Dad. -Hi, Larry. Hello, ladies. -I brought up your paper. -Oh, thanks. Here's the headline. Oh... Sick son-of-a-bitch do it again. The candlelight killer. God, I wish they'd quit sensationalizing this. Well, I guess it sells newspapers. I'm gonna go get my stuff. Good. You want some coffee? Uh, no, thanks. I'm all coffee'd out. So, you guys are gonna go to Big Bear this weekend, huh? Mmm-hmm. You know what? You two should come along with us. I know the fella who runs the bed and breakfast up there, and I bet he can squeeze you in, come on! Oh, that sounds so great, but I can't. Easter weekend. It's one of my biggest weekends. And I'm up to my neck in orders. Are you sure? Now, we're not gonna stay up there the whole weekend and I have to come back on Saturday, my company's having this big Easter party. -Come on. -Thanks. We can't. I could go. Great. We'd love to have her. Ah, Lisa has plans. -You ready? -Yep. Okay. See ya. Bye, Lis. Thanks again. Bye, honey. You guys have a great weekend, huh? WENDY: Thanks! Bye! [DOOR CLOSES] [SIGHS] Why can't I go? Because I think you and Wendy have spent enough time together for a while. There's nothing wrong with Wendy, okay? Wendy is my best friend, okay? There's nothing wrong with my best friend! That's not what I said. You know, nothing happened on their date! They didn't even kiss! I'm glad. You know, you're trying to make me lose my best friend. I wanna go away with her and her family! You don't have time to spend with me, anyway! I think you better calm down, young lady, or you're gonna go to your room. Do you hear me? That's your choice. You know, you really have changed. When I was a little kid, you treated me more like an adult than you do now! [SIGHS] [DOOR SLAMS] [HORN HONKING] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING FROM CAR RADIO] LISA: Wendy! I got to go talk to Lisa. I'll be right back. BOY: I'll be here, babe. To hell with my mom. I wanna hang out with you guys. You can't. Eric already asked Casey. Some other time, okay? Yeah. -You're right, it smells terrific. -[TELEPHONE RINGING] -Can you excuse me one second? -Yeah, of course. Designs by Katherine. Hi, guy. You home? Yeah, I'm home. Just checking in. Honey, can I call you right back? I have a customer. I'm going out. I have to meet Wendy. Okay. Uh, I'll see you at home. Love you, Lis. [BEEPING] Hey, Rick. Rad car. Wanna take me for a drive? [GARAGE DOOR OPENING] -[CAR ALARM BEEPS] -[BEEPING] Great. He's got the same code I do. I'll have to have mine changed. You're leaving his car unlocked. They re-arm themselves automatically. [SIGHS] You don't mind if I drive, do you? [BEEPING] Oh, shit.

If he found me, I would have been so embarrassed. Embarrassed? Lisa, for all you know, this guy could be some kind of a pervert. He's no pervert. How could a guy who looks like that be a pervert? But still, you shouldn't... I got to go. I'm gonna try and call him before my mom gets in. So, I'll talk to you later. Bye. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Hi, Rick. Can you do me a favor? Call me "Richard." You don't like being called Rick? No. I don't. Okay... Richard. You didn't call yesterday. I tried. There was no answer. Well, I'm sorry I missed you. You should get an answering machine. Then I could, I could leave you messages. Do you have one? Doesn't everyone? Well, it's not fair, then, is it? What isn't fair? Well, you can leave me messages anytime. I can't leave you any. I don't have your number. See what I mean? You can just pick up the phone and call me anytime you like. All I can do is sit here... And wait. Would you like me to stop calling? Oh, no, no, absolutely not. I enjoy our conversations. It's just... I don't want to feel used. I wouldn't do that to you. Ah, but you already are. You know who I am, where I work, what I look like, I don't know anything about you. I want to meet you. See you. I think that we should talk and, and get to know each other better and become, friends. Friends? You haven't even told me your name. It's Lisa. Lisa? I don't think your name is Lisa. But if that's what you want me to call you, that's fine. For now. [PHONE RINGS] Richard, I have to go. My other line's ringing. I'll talk to you later. No, wait... [SOFTLY] Lisa. Hi, guy. Sorry I couldn't talk to you earlier. I've been swamped. But I do have a surprise for you. What? I called Larry and told him you could go to Big Bear. Mom... Oh, my God! Thanks! You're really great. [CHUCKLING] Listen, it's gonna be way too late tonight, but do you want to do something fun tomorrow night? KATHERINE: Just concentrate. You'll put this one right down the middle. LISA: Yeah, sure, Mom. You know what you're doing wrong? You're letting the ball roll over the holes. You really ought to let your dad show you how to do that right. -I don't have a dad. -Oh. Could you show me? Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to. What you got to do is let your thumb come out of the ball first. -Okay, thumb out first. -Yeah, that's good. Right. Oh, yeah. That's great. LISA: Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Oh, come on! -Yeah! -Strike! Uh, spare. What? I did it with one ball! Sorry, it was the second ball. It's a spare. Aw, come on! You got to give the kid a break. -Yeah, give me a break. -Yeah. -Come on, give her a break. -Lighten up, Mom. Okay, okay. Why don't you thank the nice man? My, uh, my name is Don. -Thanks, Don. -Yeah, thank you, Don. So, do you two have names? We're, uh... We're kind of having a little family time together tonight. Oh. Okay, I understand. -You guys have a good time. Right? -Thanks. Mom. That guy was really cute and he liked you. It's my turn. Keep score. You sure are uptight. Well, what's so strange about her? Oh, I don't know. She just makes me so mad sometimes. Well, what's her problem? Well, a couple of years ago, she got pregnant and had the baby and the guy didn't want to have anything to do with her. So, now she thinks all men want is... You know. [CHUCKLES] Well, some men are like that. Uh-huh? But, Richard, she's getting stranger and stranger. Tonight this really nice man came over to talk to her. He was very polite. She thought that he was on the make. She told him to get lost. Well, I'm glad she got rid of him. Why? Well, he might have hit on you. Then I'd be jealous. How could you be jealous? We haven't even met yet. I've listened to your voice. The way you breathe into the phone. I know what you look like. What? You're beautiful. Well... That's true. See, I can tell you have a beautiful mouth by the way you form your words. And pale eyes. Blue-gray. Is your hair long and blonde? Yeah. Kind of. Why are you hiding from me? I want to see you. [DOOR CLOSING] Richard, I have to hang up. Mmm. No. Why? I just noticed the time. I have an early meeting tomorrow. Okay, wait, wait... I want you to promise me something. The next time you call, we'll make a date. Okay. Bye. I thought I heard... I think you should blow that guy off. I mean, he's more your mother's age than yours. But, Wendy, you should hear the things he says to me. He even told me I was beautiful. Lisa, he doesn't even know who you are. And anyway, if he finds out how old you are, it'll all be over. You never know. Lisa, look. Just don't let this guy know who you are, whatever you do. I mean, he could get real pissed off and get you into real trouble. -Maybe even tell your mom. -I'd be dead. See? You'd be better off setting the two of them up. Maybe if your mom had a boyfriend and got it once in a while, she might leave you alone and let you start dating. [BELL RINGING] I'm in the flower business. Yeah? What do you do in the flower business? I don't want to talk about work. Okay. Let's talk about where and when we get to meet. Remember? You promised. Do you work tonight? I work every night. But I can always get away for a couple of hours. Oh. Well, then, maybe I'll just drop by. No, no. I, I don't think that would be a good idea. Um, I don't like to mix business and pleasure. [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] KATHERINE: I'm home! I'll be right out! Oh, hi, honey. Hello? Oh, good. You're ready. Um, isn't that my dress? I was gonna wear that tonight. Sorry. I thought you'd wear your white one. Hello? I'll be right there. Wendy's telling me a secret. Okay, okay. Could you close the door? Yes, dear. Hello! Sorry, Richard. Who was that? My girlfriend. I have to go. What about tonight? I'll be wearing a sexy white dress. Bye. So what was the big secret with you and Wendy? If I told you, it wouldn't be a secret, would it? That's true. Here's your white dress. Honey, I'm gonna wear this. I think this looks great. You look prettier in this. The only trouble is, the shoes that go with it are in being fixed. No, they're not. I picked them up for you. Oh. Great. Thanks. Mom, can I borrow your perfume? Sure. Ah, take it easy, though. Huh? KATHERINE: This is really gonna be fun tonight. I'm so glad you came up with this idea. Oh, this dress... I can't wait to see this restaurant. I hope the food's good, I'm starving. Honey, I may need you to zip me up. I'll be out in a second. What made you choose this place? Mom, Muse is the "in" restaurant. It's very chic. Of course. How's my lipstick? Fine. Good evening, ladies. Do you have a reservation? Yes. Under "Holland," for me and my sister. Yes. Right this way, please. "Sister"? Well, Mom, how else are we gonna meet guys? Come on. Thank you. Would you like something to drink to start? Please. I'll have a vodka on the rocks. The same. KATHARINE: Excuse me. Could you make one of those a diet Coke, please? You didn't really want a drink, did you? The important thing is, he thought I was old enough. How come you're squirming around so much? Can we just have a good time? I'm not gonna see you for a couple of days. Mom, look at all the cute guys that are here. Smile, or no one's gonna want to meet you. [CLEARS THROAT] [VOICE RECORDING] I'll be wearing a sexy white dress. Bye.[CLICK] [BEEP] [SIGHS] I'm as normal as anyone else. Of course I want someone in my life, it's just a matter of finding the right person. But you don't even try, you just push men away. That's not true... I... I have been trying. So that's why you're on birth control pills. Hoping to get lucky. Lisa, that is my private business. So what? You stick your nose into my private business all the time. You butt into my room whenever you want. I'm your mother. It's my right. There is a diff... There is a difference between us, you know... We are not the same. [SIGHS] I'm going to the ladies' room. When he brings back the check, sign it and add 20 percent. Thanks very much. Well, well, the wild bunch is here tonight. -Hello, Morgan. How are you? -Hey, Richard, how are you? You remember Christine and Brian. -Have a good time tonight. -Thanks. -Oh! -Oh! The lady in white. Excuse me. Let's go home. Oh, Richard. I didn't see you come in. I was just gonna leave this on your desk. Did she leave? Yeah. An admirer? [CHUCKLES] Yeah. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Hello? Lisa! Look, let's stop this bullshit. What is going on? Why are you acting like this? You've never been like this. You've never been like this. You're the one who has all the rules! Honey, I love you. I am trying to protect you, that's all. Listen... You're the one who needed all these rules, not me... I'm not like you. Just because you slept around, it doesn't mean that I will, too. Listen, kiddo... I know that you are going through a lot of changes, that your body's all screwed up chemically, and people say and do a lot of stupid things when their hormones are going crazy... Hormones? It's you who has a problem with hormones! Maybe if you got laid once in a while you wouldn't be such a bitch. You get in your room! Get in your damn room! You are not going away with Wendy, and you are not leaving this room except for school... Do you understand me? No phone privileges, no nothing! [SIGHS] [SNIFFLING] Oh, so you are open this weekend. SARAH: Uh-huh. Hi, guy. Oh, hi, Kath. I do everything she says, and she still punishes me. I'm gonna sleep with every guy I ever think is cute. Well, then, just stay away from Nick. I might even sleep with Richard. I'm gonna sneak out and I'm gonna see him. Lisa, don't get crazy, okay? WENDY'S DAD: Do you see 'em, Ralph? Oh, there they are! Everything's gonna be fine. You two will work it out. No, we won't. It'll never be the same after what I said to her. Come on, jerkos! Dad's waiting! Come on, I'll give you a ride home. I don't wanna go home yet. Well, then, where are you gonna go? Come on. You are coming with us. Girls, come on. RALPH: Batman! Lisa, are you packed? I hope you're packed. DAD: I want to get on the road before we hit traffic. Let's go! RALPH: Are you twerps coming or not? [VAN STARTS] [SUV STARTS] Lisa! Lisa, where are you? Lis, will you answer me? Lisa. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Where's the spiders? Don't worry. They're around. [KNOCKING] Lisa, your mom's on the phone. Thanks. [DOOR SHUTS] Hello? I've been sitting here for hours trying to control my anger. What the hell do you mean leaving like that? I can't even trust you anymore! I didn't want to stay there and fight with you all weekend. I wanted to be with Wendy. Are you gonna tell her parents? [SIGHS] No, I'm not gonna ruin their weekend. But you and I have some talking to do when you get back here. Do you hear me? [ALARM BLARING] [SNIFFS AIR] [STARTS ENGINE] [CHUCKLING] Ha ha ha ha! [LAUGHTER] And then your grandma tried to slip you a straight shot of Scotch. You remember when grandpa and all the uncles used to stay up at night and play cards. One night, Ralphie thought it would be cute to sneak out of bed and join them. I found him at 3:00 in the morning just playing poker. Yeah. I lost five bucks. So, Lisa, do you ever go visit your grandma and grandpa? No. I've never met my grandparents. They've, uh, passed away? Who cares? They wanted my mom to get rid of me because they were ashamed of us because I didn't have a dad. And so she had to run away, and they've never talked to us. So, all we've ever had for family is each other. [LISA CRYING] WENDY: Lisa! Mr. Howard, do you happen to know if there is garage in the neighborhood? Somebody decided to take up residence in my car. This town, nobody is safe now. You should see down the block there. Police everywhere. God knows what's happening. [SIREN WAILING] WOMAN: Five, four, three. Excuse me. FEMALE REPORTER: The candlelight killer appears to have struck again in Venice. Bringing the death toll to... WOMAN 2: He had a good job. [INDISTINCT TALKING] [MALE REPORTER TALKING INDISTINCTLY] WOMAN 3: Alison didn't show up at her parent's house this weekend. And she wasn't receiving any calls. Maybe the phone was off the hook, I don't know. Her parents got very concerned and they asked me to come by and check on her. So I came here and... They were bringing the body out. It was horrible. She was dead for a week. Beautiful, young girl. POLICEMAN: Stay back everyone, please stay back. [ANSWERING MACHINE REWINDING] [BEEP] [RESTAURANT BACKGROUND NOISE PLAYS OVER ANSWERING MACHINE] [CLICK] [DIAL TONE] [BEEP] LISA: Mom, it's me. [CRYING] I'm sorry that I left like I did. I really hope you're not too lonesome by yourself. I know I've been acting like a real jerk lately, haven't I? Please don't be too mad at me. I love you, Mom. And I miss you. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? I love you. Bye. [BEEP] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [CHILDREN PLAYING OUTSIDE] [WHISPERING] Hi, guy, it's Lisa. I wanted to call you before you left for work. I got your note. Oh, good. Don't you think it's about time we were honest with each other? What do you mean? Your name... Or the name you keep giving me over the phone... In your note. I know you don't think my name is Lisa, but it is. No, it's not. It's Katherine. No. You're wrong, I'm not Katherine. My name is Lisa. Why are you calling me that? Stop lying to me. I'm telling the truth! No, you're not. Lisa! Lisa! Wendy! When are we leaving? I don't know. In a little while, I guess. I've gotta get home, now! Why? Richard thinks I'm my mom. You're dead. STOREKEEPER: How-do. That'll be $9 and four cents, please. You got four cents? I need change for the phone. Lisa? [TAPE REWINDING] [BEEP] LISA: Mom? Mom? Are you there? Okay. I know this is gonna sound funny, but if a guy named Richard calls and tells you some big story, don't believe him. He's just a kid from school, and he's playing a joke. Better go. See ya. [BEEP] RICHARD: Hi. This is Richard... I'm in your apartment... And I'm going to kill you. [SCOFFING] Kids. [WATER RUNNING] Are you home? [WATER CONTINUES RUNNING] [WATER STOPS RUNNING] Lisa, were you shaving your legs? [SING-SONG] Hello? It's your mother. Can I come in? Honey? WENDY'S DAD: Okay, Lis, you're home. Thanks, Mrs. Marks, Mr. Marks. -Honey, it's our pleasure. -Thanks again. Do you need a hand with that? No. No, thanks. I'm fine. Bye, Wend. [WHISPERING] I hope he didn't call. Bye, stupid head! -Would you please sit down? -Ah! WENDY: Call you later, Lis! [FOOTSTEPS] [KEY RATTLES IN LOCK] Mom? [LOCKS DOOR] Mom? Mom? Mom? [MUFFLED SCREAMS] LISA: Leave her alone! It's all my fault! [RICHARD GRUNTS] [SOBBING] Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! [WHIMPERING] [LISA SQUEALING] [CRYING] [CRYING AND PANTING] [WHIMPERING] [DULL THUD] [RICHARD GASPS] KATHERINE: Lisa, run! Ah! [GROANING] Come on! [GROANS] [SCREAMING] Ah! Argh! Call the police! [GASPING AND SOBBING] [STAMMERING] You took out my phone! [CRYING] Oh, no... Mom. [BOTH CRYING] Mama... I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Oh, no, no, baby, it's all right. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Unh! Ah! Get something against the door! ANSWERING MACHINE: Hi. This is the Holland residence. We're not at home right now, so please leave a message when you hear the beep. [BEEP] LISA: Mom? Mom? Are you there? [BREATHING HEAVILY] [RUSTLING] Unh! Urgh! Urgh! [GRUNTING] Urgh! Urgh! Richard! No! Ah! [WHIMPERING] [CRYING] [CRYING] [COMFORTINGLY] Shh, shh... [BEEP] ANSWERING MACHINE: Hi. This is Richard... [TAPE REWINDS] [BEEP] ANSWERING MACHINE: Hi. This is Richard...
