The beginning of the 19th century... Bands of Turks, led by the fierce Pazvanoglu, pasha of Vidin, were wildly robbing Wallachia meeting no opposition at all from the Phanariot leaders. The Outlaws ! Follow them ! The Outlaws ! Forgiveness ! You Pagans ! Tell Pazvanoglu that if he dares cross the Romanian Country once more, I swear on the dead souls of my people, He will die by my hand. Let's impale them so they get faster to Vidin. | agree ! May God give you many days to live Amza ! You wait the curse to come and say: ?The Lord giveth !" To each according to what he did and a bit more. Take the cattle back to the villages and next time give them away with the ointment. Do not mock the army of Pazvanoglu ! The wrath will descend upon you ! Off with your shalwars, we have no time left ! Heal, O Lord, the pains of the servants of Allah ! ?I, Hariclea, wife of the Ruler of the Romanian Country? ?write to the Great Pasha Pazvanoglu to let you know that " "I am taking care of our beloved, Hrisanti, until he ascends the throne. ? ?Therefore I say to you to proceed as we discussed ? "and increase your robberies in the villages across the Danube ?. ?The weaker my husband Hangerli gets, the stronger my son Hrisanti will become?. ?It is the only way to make things right for our own good " So, Pazvanoglu is skinning the country for that poor soul, who does not deserve the run in my nose. Good country ! Bad haggling ! Stupid order! This is enough ! We should go to our homes ! Let's go ! ABDUCTION OF THE VIRGINS Good to see you, people ! Girls, you are grown ups now! ! ! - Hello, father ! - Welcome, Amza ! Good thing you finally came home, Captain. Lord giveth ! You stayed home, warm and cozy, Parpanghel? What warmth are you talking about, with Fira's wide mouth.-- ? - It felt so good in the green forest ! - You shut up ! - Who are you, my beautiful girl? - I am Dobre the Miller's daughter. Good grits came out of his mill ! And you ? where do you come from? It rained with cats in Amza's yard, or did you come for confession? But we are not at Easter, when Father Calita anoints us. Strange words you say ! The world see you quite often, I say !... For Easter and Christmas ! -Anita ! - I needed an outlaw, I found an outlaw! Anita, will you bring the water ! Right away ! - Did you arrive, dear'? - I did ! When will you make your own life? The house is empty now. - Don't you dare mocking my grey hairs for hosting a mistress and not a daughter! ! ! Why do you sit ? Nothing to do ? You make of me the laughing stock of the village ! - Forget the village, mother. People's mouth is loose. Wrong my son, there's no tradition here, boy. Don't you think of poor Anita ? You're wandering around while her time will soon be over. She should endure the way I endure ! What do you know, Mom? - A Lost sheep, boy, that's what you are ! - That may be so, Mom, but time will come and I will have a big wedding, the way you want it ! And if it will happen and I will die... I'll still be married by Fall, By fall or by Winter time... All the girls will die with envy The Apple does not fall far from the tree. The captain gives a good example to his outlaws ! Look, your sister is pregnant. Ioana! Ioana... Who's there? Scarlat, your young one, played this nasty trick on her. Scarlat ! Scarlat ! You're rich now... Hallelujah outlawry. Get out ! Come on, shut up ! It's time for dinner, Your Highness. Messer Maillard... bad news? The Ruler of the Romanian Land has complained to Sultan Selim That because of Your Excellency, he cannot send the tribute to the High Gate Selim I will never forgive my rebellion. - Excellency... - I know what you want to tell me: the Sultan is weak, the Empire is collapsing, one needs an iron hand. Many would see you as a Sultan in Istanbul. For now I keep my fortress and subjects with all I rob. Great conqueror material ! The deal with the Lady of the Romanian Land will gel us closer to the moment when our dreams will come true. Not even Napoleon imagined what he is today ! Chance ! In this world you can achieve anything. Hazard, Maillard... Have mercy on me, my Lady, and give me some money ! May God help you ! Get lost ! As you are already aware, Your Majesty, the Pazvantoglu soldiers are attacking more and more. Our people cannot gather the taxes anymore. The attempts that we, the boyars, have made, took a lot of time, Your Majesty. The new Pasha of Vidin is a curse for our country and us ! 40 villages were burnt as far as last week, only. They took all the eggs in the nests. If Your Majesty can not do anything to them, We, poor people, what power do we have? Old women ! You do not know but to grumble. Stupid and narrow-minded you are ! You think that this is all about gathering the taxes ? Not to gather, but knowing how to gather, that's the idea ! But you don't know that, and forgot that the people of this country did not forget who they are. If you forgot who you are, ask your subjects to teach you again. When you've done it a long time ago without loss of souls. If you forgot who you are, ask your subjects to teach you again. And only then they will forget to resist. Does the cow know for whom it works? We need slaves in this country, not people. It's been a year since the Pazvantoglu soldiers started robbing us. Did Your Highness forget that last fall it rained at the right moment? It rained with frogs and the royal sewers are empty. And all you do is feed forgetting bout the tribute. Who forgives me ? Nobody. So I will not forgive anybody ! No one!!! Boyar Dudescu, greedily and ruthlessly comes here to collect the tribute on the day of Saint Dumitru, Beskir Pasha. Hang, kill, collect ! ! ! These are all the words I learnt. And you, Doctor, what are you waiting for'? My Lord knows how naughty he is and how careful we are with him. That's what I am paying you for. He sat on the floor, spinning the frame while I was working on the painting. When I turned back, he ran away. The scoundrel ! Make the rest of the souls of your subjects eternal, O, Lord, and may you mention them. Make the rest of the souls of your subjects eternal, O, Lord, and may You mention them in all eternity ! - Mercy ! - Mercy ! Give us some food... it's Saturday Dead, lady... You stupid one ! You will rule among dead not among the living !!! When will you eat your alms? Come on ! How many times did I command you not to mingle among servants and beggars ? My Nurse feeds me only with a mackerel and one glass of milk. Very nice ! You stay with dead people and eat the alms of the poor! But I'm hungry ! Look in the mirror and get scared ! When I go to bed, and when I wake up, a worm eats me alive here. Be Patient ! Rotting alive and you will still feed this mortal corpse. I need you and you need me. Help me ! You can only help by listening to me. You are my strength and I am yours in this hostile world that wants our collapse. - Boyar Dudescu awaits you. - Take care of the boy. Hope you are no longer doing stupid things... - Did you bring the letter'? - I did. - Have all the council boyars signed it? - They did. And? - Strange times, cousin? - I fear. His Majesty was angry in the court. He commanded me to gather the tribute but we won't do that, by your secret command ! Give me the paper ! - I Do not see your name. - But Madam... I give your daughter a throne and you haggle for a trace of Ink on this stupid paper'? Sign it and stop making me sick ! If His Majesty finds out, we are all dog food. They would have a proper meal once a year... You no longer feed servants and animals in this Romanian country. Indeed. - Are all the reasons here ? - Yes they are. Did you write he is cunning and unfaithful? We did! Did you write he wants to escape to America with the fortune promised to the High Gate? - All here, in black and white. - Good. Then I will send Hrisanti to the monastery, for our peace of mind. He needs be far from the wrath that will enter our house. Lord, our God, help us! Stop making crosses, you gotta believe first! First believe and then you will pluck what you seeded. This matter is known only by the two of us and Pazvanoglu. Go! You must go to Istanbul at once ! You must look for Scribe Ifrim in the Galata suburb. Make a copy and give it to the great Dragoman. You take this back and give it to me upon return. What if Prince Hangerli finds out that his wife wants him dead ? I know... One has seen prince wives fed to dogs or to hell's darkness. Better a black future than knowing I cannot truly ruled. You rely too much on the honor of these boyars you are planning everything with. Stupid ones !!! I am only using them ! This letter shall find the prince before the arrival of the executioner. Then the prince will behead his beloved boyars. By the laws of the Land, he will also lake their wealth. The wisdom of such thoughts makes me cherish you even more, Madam. The boyars money will reach your pockets, Your Highness. Without these fortunes, Hrisanti would never have the throne. Go! Its been a year since I am on this throne, ruling... The wealth promised by my lying servants is nowhere to be seen. This land gives birth to dung, not gold! The hand collecting money is too soft and my commands are given to deaf people. Something is swarming in the underground. I am afraid of what my fate is preparing for me. For no dreams of glory drove me to this foreign land, but its gold. Without it I cannot go to America. Your Highness, do you have some spare time to listen to me, please ? What bothers you, Madam? My boy is not feeling well. He needs to change the air. His Beloved Father, whom I did not know, but to whom I have a lot of respect, must have been a frail man... Fates have given me a glass of poison at his birth-. They wished for grief and torment for me. So, please, allow him My Lord, to accompany the doctor to Surpatele He should take care of himself. You, my Lord, do not look well either" Did the boyars upset you with their thoughtless words ? Do they not respect you enough? Do they want to hurt you ? They do that whenever and wherever they can, ever since I know them Our place is trembling...it is not secure. Reluctance and hatred lay hidden and work together for the destruction of our family. I feel this Land does not want us. We think that we are strong because we have the power. What a deceit ! We are only intruders here. Within this mob, there is a power greater than ours. There will come a time when we will have to leave poorer than when we arrived here, Madam. Let our worries at God's mercy. As for the boyars plots, leave them to me, Your Majesty. I will find them out and give them in to you. You are glad, but you will not gel rid of me, remember that ! You took my throne that was meant for me, after the death of my father, and now you don't even want to see me ? I'm not going anywhere ! You only feed me bread and water... Both you and my mother who says she loves me... What are you doing here, you stupid? Did you forget the duties of the children to their parents? On your knees ! Kiss the hand of your benefactor! He's not my father, in me does not flow his blood. I give only obedience. I listen to him, but I won't give him my heart You must understand, my son and then subdue ! All I am saying to you is this: be patient !! - We are ready to go. - Come on ! Did you bring me here to kill me? Open up, you thieves ! I want to be free ! - My boy... - Get out of my sight! - My baby... ? You fool! You want to get rid of me? Did you sell yourself to the usurper, too ? You drank the milk from my breast, I took care of you ! Why do you upset your nanny? Come, calm down ! - Listen to my words ! - I need go to the miraculous icon. Alright, if you really want it and you're nice and kind, we go. Go away! Let me out ! I want I want I want the icon ! Kill the usurper, my Lord! Give him a death to suit him! Redeem me! Relax. The stupid is heavily guarded. The walls of the monastery are quite high. There's no pleasure waiting for us inside. If you cannot enter with a gun, you use the wisdom ! Rub him well, Anita, the man only gets married once. What kind of groom are you ? So dirty you are !! Make sure, you will leave some skin on! It's time you end partying all night long and time spent with other women ! - I agree to that! - You say it, but must also do it! Mine is also out in the world partying! - Is he not pursuing his outlaw affairs ? - I know very well what affairs he pursues! Go ahead and leave, you messed him up with all these thoughts. Why do you interfere ? You're no better than that, either !!! Did you ever see an outlaw settled home ? The travel and a pile of straw under his head, is all he needs !! - He only wishes justice for his nation! - Like master, like man. Let's ride ! But the wedding? You ordered it! Until the wedding we have a job to do. Did you subdue when at the monastery ? Look what I got, take them ! Count them and be quiet. Are you ready, you groom ? Will you still fit into those clothes? You look very proud! You will make the hens cackle... Else we need to lake him away, cage and all. Come on, Parpanghel's Horses, your load is quite exquisite! What do we do with the chicken, Captain? They are making us crazy. Someone will lake care of them and kill them. Have mercy, Lady, I guarded him with my life. You, go to prison! - Great Lady, the evil moment! ? Get lost! This must end ! A crazy monk from Mount Athos is here. He has visions He knows all things visible and invisible. Make him shut up! - How can one get up there? ? That way! Do you know me? How do you want my eyes to remember other eye glances ? I think you are the on to accompany a ruler... How do you know that? My mind tells me great pain brought you here. What can you tell me about my son? I see forests and running waters... And he ? - My eyes do not see the blood yet. - Alive? Eat, your Ladyship. And? I can see a price. I will give all the gold in my possession, will build an altar... Gold has no price to God. Holy man, speak! If Pazvanoglu will not stop his robberies your Hrisanti will end up will end up a bag of bones. Come down and say no more. You know the Price. Make way, here comes His Highness, Pasha Pazvanoglu. Here is my fortress. Three streets of beggars, a mosque and a palace. Kind of small for someone who wants to be the leader of the Ottoman Empire! Napoleon was no richer than that during his campaign in Italy. You can never be as rich as you hope to be ! But also not as poor as you think you are! - Words, Maillard! - Words are good every now and then. While here, I learnt one too: ?Make yourself brother with the devil so you can cross the bridge. " The devil I made a brother with is actually a woman, Maillard. What brings you to these places, Madam ? You must not be seen around here! You have to stop robbing the Romanian Country. You ruin our agreement ! You ruin our agreement ! Such an agreement is of use to you so you can keep the throne for your son. My son was kidnapped! Amza's Outlaws looked for him, they knew his hideout. They ask me not to cross the Danube anymore. - All my hopes are here now. - I knew they were foolish. - Their insolence surpasses my patience. - You have to stop! Madam, it is impossible for me. They have no law, no God! If they kill Hrisanti, everything I tried to create for our good, will simply vanish. I cannot, I must finish what I started. Find me where these outlaws are hiding! I'll handle the rest. Be calm! Fira, see what happens with that wine! It waited a long time, now it's time we rinse our mouth with it to the great satisfaction of our souls... How beautiful she is ! Here comes the groom, come on! Come ! It is time you say farewell, bride... - Ready? - Ready, Captain ! From your mother, from your father From brothers and sisters... A stranger will lake us, my boy... Here leaves your sister... He's no stranger mother, he is one of our outlaws, a fit and strong guy ! The house will remain empty. Go and do your things... You are so restless ! Just like your father ! That and he only saw him once in year and then in fear... I wonder who do you resemble with ? All of you, mount the horses and go away! It was written in the starts that way, mother ! Your groom, Scarlat, will stay home. He is a calm and quiet guy, he has no place in our business. He's a soft guy, therefore a good boyfriend. - Stop it, or the entire world will see us! - You're all mine, now. Get out or you got crazy! Stop staring or my man will notice you and punish you. Come out, do you hear me? Or you fell in love')... - Did you fall in love with me, or what ? - Yep...in love.. aha-.. We will take you back to your mother, no matter what. I wonder who your father is ? You are so proud ! Come on, get out ! - Out, out, don't you understand? - No! - No! - Come on, come on ! Run away groom, or I will throw boiled water on you ! You are spoiling the traditions. Go, go !!! Carcalete, start singing because Scarlat will take the bride to church! My Filomela, kalitsachi mou, psichi mou (gr.), my soul. What ? Leave this guys alone, we'll take you to your mother and make a hell of a wedding, better than this one. - Where was my groom! - You don't want?! I will make you The First Lady of this Country! We unite in marriage the servant of the God, Ioana, with the servant of the God, Scarlat, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen ! Lord Our Saviour, unite the two in eternal marriage ! - Take heed, peace to all! -And your spirit... Brothers, subdue forever to all that belong to God !!! Women subdue to your husbands as to God, the way Church subdues to Jesus Christ. Men have a duty to love their women, same as their own bodies, same as Christ loves His Church. Anita, did you dress up? You look so fancy ! Ouch ! Anita ! Wait, Anita ! Leave me alone! Let me go, go away! Do you remember, Anita, how many nights we spent counting stars here ? Yes ! I was dear to you then... Go to your other sweethearts !!! The man does look around, but he always returns to his nest. - Stop it, people may see us - So what? - You're not mine? - Only on Fridays and when there's no lightning. Mouth is worse than you, cause you have a kind heart. My head is the only one to know how much I take ! Forgive me, wedding guests, but I came to tell you that boyar Belivaca has robbed our folks in Corlatesti. Now he wants to run away. He took everything. No cattle left, no birds, no grains left. If you hurry, you might catch him in his lordly house. I'm sorry, I do not want to destroy your wedding But tomorrow at dawn they leave for foreign countries. What do you say children, shall we let them leave ? Sweet is Heaven, God, and a river of milk flows through it. If we want a party, let's have a party! I will be back by dawn. Who knows, only if you do not end up hanged. As a widow I will probably find one or two other lovers, soon. You do that and I will haunt you ! You won't sit nicely anywhere, not even to your sister's wedding ! We'll be back, mother! Words! Who knows where will he have his soup?! Goodbye, see you soon and healthy. With a lot of room for the wine !!! - Am I right, unholy one ? - You say big things, Captain! You got all fat, my girls. Where are the girls I used to party with up, at the Red Fountain, 10 years ago? Paunita, come and pour some wine ! Leave the cup here and go! Your skin looks nice and you look firm... You lovely girl! You'll be the only one I want to take with me - Where are you going, boyar Belivaca? - Faraway, looking for fresh girls. - Aaaaa ! - Ups ! There you are, unfaithful you ! Do you think I am not aware of your thoughts When you sleep standing? Aaaah! You tell me you're going to the monastery to confess whereas you play all sorts of games here with your whores. I'll rip you apart !!! Bitch! You like boyars, now, you stink? And you ? Where are you old scamp? You think you are Prince charming, eh? You ignore me totally, now. You don't even see me on Wednesdays and Fridays, when sewing is not allowed! You say it's a feast day ! Ouch ! Help me, folks, I'll give you something. Thanks, mister, you do not need to, we took it ourselves. Come on! Come, Marghiolita, the thieves found the money! Come, Marghiolita!!! Catch the thieves, they robbed me!!! Marghiolita Robbers are coming! Tell them I'm your companion! Come on, pretty on, take me in your arms! Your Majesty, you are expected by His Highness, Pasha Pazvanoglu. Your mother facilitated this. Mother ! Where's mother'? The woman comes with me. And the outlaws? - I pay you for nothing... - Lord, give me some time ! They will come looking for me. Holy Mother of God, deliver us from evil! Deliver us with your prayers, oh, Holy Mother! Let him be punished according to the Christian law ! No! Follow me! Amza I Amza I Amza I Help! Amza I Do not leave us, brother, do not leave us! - Who is the chief of the guard? - I am. Arhonda, tell His Highness that I bring urgent news from Istanbul. Come with me, Efendi ! Take the horse to the stables! Change the guard at the high gate! Command us, Lady! Go right now and ask boyar Dudescu to come at the Stavropoleos church. Madam, our final hour is here. What's all this nonsense? My man from Istanbul sent word that someone is on the way here to kill me. - No way! - Yes, Madam. How long will the executioner need to get to Bucharest? Three days. My reign was brief and fruitless. The Country is a desert, my luck - a waterless fountain. Words are not helpful in moments such as these. Read! What? The Boyars complained about me to the Sultan ? It is not written in black and white? And your cousin, Dudescu, is among them! Blood makes a treason more valuable. I can't wait to behead him! I'll tie their corpses by my carriage and run with them ! I will feed the corpses to the dogs! But You will take their possessions first. What you did not gather in one year, you can have in two days. It's time you find where they hid their golden tools and money. We cannot leave poor ! You forget, madam, that the executioner will arrive here in 3 days time? Then nothing can save us. Fill your coffers with whatever helps you keep your family in exile, there's no party there ! Leave the walls painted in the blood of the traitors. Sprinkle his way with their fat corpses. I am listening to you, Madam. My revenge is thirsty now. The Prinoe learned of the boyar's treason and wants you all killed. My carriage is waiting for you outside. Hide somewhere safe until the wrath is gone. In three days the killer will be here. You may call your daughter back from Vienna. In three days, you say? Death is in a hurry... He will be here tonight, or at dawn tomorrow, the latest. I go! God save us from misfortunes and bad happenings! Come to Fira! Come to Fira, people! Let me foretell you, you beautiful, and find out where your lover is, and his folks! What are you staring at? Have you not seen a woman before? Come to Fira, you beautiful, to foretell you, and to let you know where your fortune lies! Come to Fira! Do you not want to be told the future by that gipsy in the street ? Yeah ! Call the guards and tell them to bring her upstairs! I want you to bring here the fortuneteller downstairs !! Let me foretell the future for you, you handsome, to show you what will wait for you in your bed and whom you will spend the night with. - I think I saw you somewhere before. - Be quiet, I don't want people to find out! - But... - Or I'm no longer dear to you? Give me your hand, you handsome! You have a long way ahead of you, together with your mother. - My mother? Where is my mother'? Do not worry, she won't leave a treasure like you rot in Vidin. Tell me how should the outlaws gel in here, streets are crowded. Your Excellency, the executioner sent by Selim came this morning close to Bucharest. The mind of that Lady worked better than I imagined. Does Your Highness believe that Haricleea will keep her word? She is a weak creature. The one who kills the husband in cold blood is not weak. Even if that blood is the price of her son's happiness. Long ago I think woman and allowed evil seed. So? So, when I have the promised money for my mercenaries, only then this loving mother will regain her precious son. The guard of the Turkish cemetery knows some cellars that lead under the fortress, in the Turkish bath. - There will be many people and a big dinner. - Come on, give Fira some money - I don't have! - Look well ! - I don't have any. Oh... poor as a mouse! What kind of a prince's son are you ? And why is everybody going crazy for you, I don't know. Fira! Talk to him gently... Away, woman! You will upset His Highness, Pazvanoglu ! What do I care about Papacioclu or Papagogu or whatever his name is? It is clear he is a rude guy, if he did not teach you manners. In this rotten place you are all alike. I will show you, you rotten servant, how you should behave with the companion of a Ruler's son ! The Lady is right! Away with you, Ibrahim. The place of a woman is in the Master's harem. This is the only law related to women, it is common sense. I'll complain to the Ruler ! The Ruler is present here, and bows down to you. - Who are you? - Pazvanoglu. The master of this unfaithful servant ? Ibrahim, ask for the Lady's forgiveness! I can not be humiliated in front of a woman. Lord, kill me! Ibrahim ! What should I do? If you humiliate him now, he will kill himself. Therefore, will you, nil you, I am your hostage. You're a tyrant ! Ibrahim, the Lady is free to leave the palace. Anytime ! Who do you think you speak to, the Metropolitan donkey? Girl, stop making a fuss and take off the clothes or...! Pasha Pazvanoglu will come and whack us all. Such a shame to see a boyar like you sewing the Turks! Shut up! Instead of kissing my hand and enjoying how I make ladies out of you, teaching you to behave, you mock me ! Girls, do not let yourselves mocked by him! Do not let your girls, you defile bastard ! Forgive her, forgive her cause she's stupid and has no idea what luck came over her... Ouch! Slower, more mercifully, or you make her ugly! Stop ! She does not want to undress, my lord. No, Efendi ! Forgive her ! Give her the shalwars! You cannot enter this side. It should be opened from the inside. You just wait and see if we will be able to get out of here ! Nobody can prevent us from entering the palace, not even the devil and his nephews. I am listening, Efendi. You said you will give me a harem, too, so I can take advantage of the happiness bestowed by Allah on Earth, O Lord! Do you abide the Law of Muhammad? Today I go to the mosque, to get baptized. Maybe your Lordship will do me the honor to... Okay, I'll come. But please tame those country girls, first. And mind you, keep calm! How can you ask that, O, Lord? What else should I praise with at my age? All I want is to look at them, cause they are very well ?built?. Teacher, do what you wish but please, see Anita. Tell her that if she does not lake us out of here, we are all dead. You understand? Go! Lord, the outlaws are trapped like rats in a trap. I knew they would come, I was waiting for them. What are your orders, Your Highness? Nothing ! Let them find peace. Air! Air Are you Romanian? Lady, have mercy and hear me ! Half Romanian and half Greek. The entire Phanar has added something to my blood. That Christian baptism it is! Go back. Well, that's a good say, brother, as I bathe only for Easter and Christmas! Easter and Christmas are gone now, Mohammedan religion now begin! Stupid! Do they still torture him? He will get a cold, poor man Up! Your name will now be Mustafa. Mustafa ll! Mustafa! Here you are, you stupid? This is where you are hiding from me? Oh! What is this shirt you wear? Where is your waistband? Where are your pants? Oh, Hristea, I will that sweep Vidin with you... Oh boy, you've lost your mind now, when you're old ? Old Robber! What have you eaten to become so crazy? You went so wrong the Christian law is not enough to you ? I am no longer enough for you, Hristea? You need additional women '2! You want a harem, now ? You impotent... God won't help you put back on your trousers from the Main Fast to Christmas, will He? Hristache, if I catch you I will make mince meat of you! Are you running from me, Hristea? I will turn Vidin upside down and still catch you! Hristea, you need a harem, really?! Unfortunate sins! Oh! Gel out or I'll smoke you like a fox! These doors have their secrets, so watch out. Yes. I'll give it to you for free, plus 10 more coins, just sell it! - Go to hell! - Where did you get this odalisque, Efendi? She's my wife. As I have a right to sell her, I will sell her! Oh boy, you sell me, the way Christ was sold! Your wife brand new... Is it allowed? Enter! Your palace doors are quite open! The water lets me guess what I suspected ever since I saw you. We will not be able to talk like that. No! Please! I like a daring man, but I do not like insolence. Do not look like that, please! A woman likes to be looked at passionately, not in a curious way. It's hard for anyone to disturb me anymore. Any woman in this fair would be happy to be in your place. It's boring to get everything ready. You show the safety of a woman who knows she does not owe anything to anybody. I would now like to get dressed. No, no, you'd better go! I will. I came to tell you we have a party tonight. You are invited. Thank you ! Almighty God punish him for his evil heart and for making us widows-. The Berlesti, estate from boyar Dumitrache-Bals. Rather little considering how much he wanted and robbed. The Baldovinesti estate from boyar Cretulescu. He could have brought more. Money cry by themselves, they are made of blood and agony. You should not forgive that, either. The Raspberry Estate, belonging to boyar Vasile Balota. Good price ! - Who is disturbing my affairs? - The angry wives. Their moans and cries leave me cold. Did they bury their husbands? They took them last night to the cemetery. I saw the candles burning like on Easter, from the tower, and I loved it. They rest now, where I was supposed to be. - Death does not forgive anyone... - What are those words, Madam? Are you ready for the trip? We cannot wait anymore! - Is the count ready? - Ready, Your Highness. - Did you take your share? ?As we agreed. Shake him well, too, so he won't be worried about what he earned. Not possible, Your Majesty! For me it's enough, if I take some from you, too. Get out of my sight! No gentleman ever broke the usury law. You sinned a lot because of him! You should have had mercy with him. And who will have mercy on me, Madam? Either the roads are shorter now, or your people lied to me. He was supposed to be here tomorrow. Death always comes too soon, Your Highness. - Pray! - Impossible! - Not true. - Yes, it's true... As true as you will be able to see with your head and mind. Firman ! In the name and by the irrevocable command of the Enlightened Sultan Selim III, you are losing the throne of the country as we speak. You are condemned to death! The girls are in the room up the corridor. But what is this, the Assumption of the Virgin Mary? Is this a party? It is so obvious the only thing you can handle is the sword !
