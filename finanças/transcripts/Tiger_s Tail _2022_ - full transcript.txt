Incantation! Drink it. Poison! It's my birthday party, allow me have have fun. - Tiger! - Yes! What is it you want that I can't give you? You know I don't like sharing my man with other women. Really? Mr. Tiger! What is the matter with you? We are in the club. - Go and book a room. - I've forgotten that we are in the club... Do you want to sleep with her here? - JT! Senior man! - Get a room. Excuse me for some minutes. Everybody have fun... I want to go and feel alright. Leave the way. You will get the pictures tomorow, Richie. I'll make sure I send them in the morning. How are you girls doing? How are you enjoying the party? - Do you guys placed your orders already? - Yes, definitely. I love the wigs, man. It's so cute. - This is the best ever... - Look at your dress girl. Yeah. You enter the email, right? I will make sure I send it, just wait till morning. Tutu, when is Amara getting here? I have to call you back. Richie, I told you we're organizing a dinner party for my friend... I'll call you. - Anything like? - When is she getting here? Oh, there she is. Oh my God, you won't believe this. Udoka proposed, I'm getting engaged. Hi guys. I'm so happy for you. You know, with you? I told you. Yes. Yes. This is lovely. I don't know. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Thank you boo. You are welcome. I love you. Have you guys had something to eat? Yeah. Okay, we are here now, let's get the party started. Baby, let's have a seat here. Thank you, baby. Public service announcements. Agwoin the building. Yes! Do you hear me? I said Agwoin the building. What is Snake doing here, is that not Snake? Is that not Snake? He is the one. I thought you said they are shutting down the club for Tiger's birthday party. That's why I'm shocked to see snake here too. Where are you, Aliyu? Aliyu! Aliyu! Aliyu! - How far? - Come here. How far guys? What's going on? Aliyu, what's the matter? What is Snake doing here? This is exactly what happened... Nobody asked you for history. - What is Snake doing here? - Calm down... In fact, you don't need to answer the question. Send them away. What? Tell him to leave instantly. Snake paid me way more than you did... And this is my business, what do you expect me to do? Are you still talking? What's wrong with this idiot? Idiot! Please don't be annoyed. - What's wrong with this man? - Relax, relax... What's that look? Let's go. What? What did you just say? We should leave the club for Snake? - Tiger! - Poison! Let's go. You are saying we should leave the club for Snake? Let's go. Tiger! You must be crazy. Didn't I warn you? - Oga, your head lamp is not with me. - Beat him Beat him. - My head lamp is not with you? - Segun... - You know... - Didn't I tell you? I've warned you to not come near this area anymore... But you wouldn't listen, where is his head lamp? His head lamp is not with me. You stole my head lamp and side mirror... Did you see me with any head lamp? - Segun! - With my head lamp? Did I steal any side mirror? Beat him Are you okay? Yeah, I'm good, just work, work stuff. I did not steal anything... I'm not lying. Are you mad? What is he doing? - Stop! Stop! - Beat him! - Can you stop that? - Beat him Stop! What's happening? Are you mad, what's happening to you? Do you know his offence? He's a thief, he stole my head lamp and side mirror. I didn't steal your head lamp. And beating him is going to give you back your side mirror and head lamp? Wait... Who is this one? She's one of the slay mamas living fake life. Hey, don't talk to my woman like that. Then, find rope and tie your woman, so she can mind her business. I am not a dog. - Would you mind your... - And this child does not deserve this. Stop it! You call him a child? He's capable of impregnating you. He's been terrorizing this area for a long time. It's okay. Segun! Do you see what you have caused? Segun! The boy has escaped. Eh! Do you see what you have caused? I will break your head. - Stop that rubbish, are you crazy? - You allowed the guy escape. Who do you want to beat? The boy has escaped. Let's go guy. Tiger! Why did we leave the club for Snake? Why did we leave the club for Snake? That is rubbish. Normally, we are supposed to destroy everywhere and deal with that rubbish manager, Aliyu. And then what? What question is that? Why are you asking me such? The Tiger I knew... Tiger would have shot the manager in the leg at least twice for uttering such statement. What's the matter? What's going on? What is happening? Or... Have you lost your nerve? Can we talk about it, baby? What they were doing was wrong. The boy is a thief. The boy is just a child. And if this was abroad, those knuckleheads will be arrested for treating him like that. Exactly, abroad, but this is Nigeria... And in Nigeria, when someone gets caught stealing, the public will serve justice the best way they deem fit. That's just ridiculous. This is why I really need to set up my foundation ASAP... Baby, setting up heart of hope is amazing, but you need to be careful. Crazy people on the streets, crazy things are happening. Amara. You need to promise me that you will be careful. Okay? I don't know what I would do if anything happens to you. Please. I hear you, it's fine. - You do? - Yes Promise? Jesus! What are you doing here? We need to talk. Talk about what, what are you doing here? Now is not a good time please, Amara is inside. What? What do you mean what? She slept here? Of course she slept here, where would she sleep? She's my Fiancee, in the car park? Indeed, Fiancee indeed. Keep your voice down. Baby! Who's there? It's... No on... Tutu. Hey girl! Hey boo! I missed you. How's it going? Oh, I was worried about you yesterday. You just disappeared. I had this terrible stomach upset. I had to just leave. But I told Udoka before I left though. - Oh! - He didn't tell you? You did? - You didn't tell me. - Yes, she did... Yes, she did. I think I forgot, I'm sorry. It's okay. Girl, you look so cute. What are you doing here so early? She came to get a hard drive. Hard drive collecting. I could drop you off though, what are you... Drop... No, thank you. Thank you so much. - Why not? - But you're not even ready. I'm not. I'll be in just five minutes. That's what you said 30 minutes ago, I am ready and you're not. You're still in your PJs. I'll just go with Tutu. Oh, no, it's okay. No need to bother Tutu. Trust me Udoka, trust me Amara, it's not a bother. Girl, let me just get my purse, I'll be back. You sure? Give me a second. You better not tell her anything. What can I possibly say to her? Hmmm. That we slept together? Shut up! Don't try it. Look, if you do that, you and I done for. What's funny? It's not even funny, why are you laughing? All right, what's the joke? What did I miss? Nothing. It's Udoka, he is so funny. - Really? - Udoka trust me... If you tell Amara some of these jokes, she would laugh. Baby tell me the jokes, I want to know. So I want to know they're funny is just something. It's not even that funny, it's just something. - You look so good baby. - Thank you. - Thank you baby. - You are so beautiful. Thank you. Can you help me grab my bags from the living room? Yeah. You sure you don't want me to drop you? No. I've missed you, girl. Let's go, babe, talk to you later. Hey, girl. Hey, girl. So, were you too much already, honey? Ahn ahn! Are you still angry? Yeah. Big. No fix for your guilt. No, I just watch your back, You are my king... And that's my duty as your queen. And that's my duty as your queen. Please. My king! King! Tiger! Tiger! Who dares my Tiger? Powerful Tiger! Please, don't be annoyed. Please don't be annoyed. - Can't you knock before you enter? - Eh! Eh! He looks disgusting. What's the matter? We are out of cash... My mother asked me to come and seek your help. What do you mean? We have concluded that you are going back to school... I've sent money to your mother. I didn't get a dime from her. I think she spent it all on her boyfriend. Pass me a spoon. Have you eaten? No. Go ahead. I'm not hungry. Are you out of your mind? I told you to eat... Come on, pick a plate... Go ahead. Open... What's wrong with you? Eat and stop acting like an imbecile. Serve plantain and eat. Open the plate and eat, stop shivering. A couple of things have definitely changed since I last came home. I know, right? Speaking of change, I still can't believe you and Udoka are engaged though. Girl, to be honest, I can't believe it either. But I'm excited. Are you sure about this, though? The rock is cute. Oh, hey, my mom's coming. Hi, Momma. I'm so sorry I haven't called you. How's it going? Mom, guess what? Udoka proposed. I'm so excited Mom Thank you. I'll send you pictures of the ring in a little bit. Me too, Mom. I'm happy. I'm excited. No home training. Where's the idiot, has he left? Don't stare at me like that. I don't even know why you would permit the boy to come here and disturb us everytime. You are getting worked up because my nephew ate the food you made? The food is not my problem... I'm getting worked up because I know this boy you are pampering will betray you in future. See Snake now. That's different. How? Tell me, how is it different? Let me inform you, incase you don't know... This your nephew? He's wiser than you thought... He'll soon start working for Snake. Do you know what you just said is bullshit? Really? Okay... It seems like I'm saying rubbish, right? No problem. I'm warning you to be vigilant, Tiger. Be vigilant! I'm telling you something, you are saying... Give it to me. Is this everything? Won't you share it with me? I was given this money. You don't like Funke Akindele? You want your own share while you eat free food in this house... When am I supposed to reap from you, when I'm dead? Am I the one you are... Am I the one you are raising shoulder for? You'll regret your life if I get hold of you. Thief. Now you know how to spend money. You are not getting a dime from this money. Yes, Mom. I heard you. I'll go for the interview tomorrow, I promise. No, I just got home. I can se... Soji is standing right in front of me. I see him here. Uh huh. - I have to go. - Bye, girl. Already, Mom. Okay. Welcome, Ma. What? Okay, fine. Let's talk. Tutu! What did you tell Amara? Oh, so that's the reason you suddenly want to talk? Tutu, don't be like this. Like what? Mad? Aggravated? Upset? Disappointed? You told me you're going to break up with her. You told me you're going to tell her about us... And next thing, you guys showed up and she has your ring on? Tutu, it's not that simple. Okay, calm down. It's complicated. It is definitely complicated Because you can get to someone while someone else is carrying your baby. What? You heard me right? - What did you just say? - I am pregnant for you. Guy, show. - Mufu, how are you? - How are you? You said you want to see me. I am good, Mufu please... Can you borrow me some cash? For what? Will you borrow me or not? Why are you questioning me? I don't have any money to borrow you. - You don't have money? - Yes - And you bought a new phone? - So what? Let me tell you something... I worked hard before I could afford this phone... Go and work if you need money. Bad boys... What's happening? Don't mind this Debo guy, always forming good boy. So, we are bad boys? - My guy. - Dullard. I don't even mind to be a bad boy, as long as I'm making steady money. He's not even aware. See Snake for example... That's my role model. There's a parol tonight, are you coming? Guy, are you coming or not? He's asking you a question... - Are you coming or not? - You are dulling yourself. You are eyeing woman... Let us go. Good morning. Please, I want to buy something. Give me corn flakes. Alright. Thank you, and have a nice day. And please help me greet your Mom. Thief! Please help me! He just passed here, and the other one went the other way... Help me! Thief! Thief! Oh, my goodness. Soji, we have 30 minutes, are we going to be there on time? Leave the road. Are you sick? Soji! Don't mind all these children, they are from Onigbo community. They've turned begging here into a trade. That's really sad. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Stop the car, we need to help him. No, we are not the one that him. I said, stop the car, we need to help him. Wait... Leave him... Let's go... Okay, this will help him. It's Mom. She's calling again. Oh, okay. Hey! I'm sorry. Where's my brother? I was informed that my nephew is here. Debo! You are Debo's uncle? Ehn ehn? You are such a very irresponsible man. What is a young boy like that doing out there in the streets on a school day. Wait, I don't undersatnd. Who is this? Who are you? The only person who's willing to bring him to the hospital after he got hit by a car. Okay. If you cannot take care of your nephew, give him to somebody else who will. Enough! That's enough, what's your problem? See how you keep running your mouth. - JT - What's your problem? - I will stabbed you eyes with this thing. - Jay, Jay! - What's her problem? - Calm down. So... Are you done ranting or not? Do you find this funny? Be responsible and take care of your nephew. Because if this happens next time, he might die. I'm out of here. This doesn't make any sense. Better talk to her. What are you doing here? We need to talk. Fine, talk. You can't. I mean, you just can drop this bombshell on me... and expect us not to talk about it. The same way you dropped the engagement bomb at me and not talk about it. What do you want? I wanted you to not propose to Amara. But since that ship has sailed... I guess I just have to... Ruin your life. Tutu! What are you doing? Making a call. Irresponsible, arrogant, annoying... Walking around with a chip on his shoulder, telling me rubbish. Hey, babe. Hey, Amara. How are you? I'm just... I'm really upset and tired. Oh, anyways, there's this guy I really want you to speak to. He's a mutual friend. You'd love to speak to him. Hello, Tutu, are you there? Are you okay? What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Can I have my phone back? What are you doing? Ruining your life. What did you hear me say? Udoka, my phone. Come down. Have you gone mad? Debo! What is wrong with you? I decided to get you here first before I unleash my anger on you. What were you doing? What have you asked for, that I failed to provide? If you ask me for money... Don't I give you? But Bros... Who's is your bros? You call me bros, yet, you don't listen to me. Your father is in jail... Do you want to join him there? Ehn Debo? What's the matter? What were you doing with all these crazyboys that rob people of their belongings? Debo! Let this be a warning... Next time... I swear... What I will do to you... You won't believe it, can you hear me? - Are you listening? - Yes sir Go home and meet your mother who's been searching for you all over. Make sure you take your medicines. Take your medicines, do you hear me? Are you mad? I will slap you with your injured head. Mad fellow. Tutu! Why are you doing this? You really need to stop following me around. 5 million! For what? 5 million, get rid of that baby and forget about me. You are joking, make it a 100. Don't be ridiculous. 150! Tutu! I'm trying to solve a problem. Are you trying to solve a problem or you're trying to clean up your ass? You know what? Enough of this bullshit, alright? You're in as much trouble as I am. Let's not forget that you slept with your best friend's boyfriend, okay? If Amara finds out, we're both in trouble. So get off your high horse and let us try to solve this amicably like adults. Gosh. Alright Mama. I love you. Bye. - Soji! - Ma'am! Where did you say these kids are from again? These beggars? Oh, they are from Onigbo community. Can you please take me there? Ma? Take me there, I want to have a closer look at the community. - Ma, I don't... - Take me there, Soji. Thank you. Yes, Ma. See fine girl. That's me. Thank you. Let me see the pictures. See how beautiful you look. It's so pretty. Happy Birthday! Sing birthday song You are blessed. Sexy girl... Happy Birthday! Take it, I bought it for you with my money. Segun bought it for you. It's inside. Check inside. Thank you. - Do you like? - Yes I do. Come to daddy, my baby girl. Pack it, it's all yours. Hand it over, let me take my leave. Alright, take care. Bye. Take care, bye. My guy, go and package yourself. Your heart has been broken. Who's calling me? Hello, Boss. He's broke and still chasing a woman. Now, right? No problem, I will be on my way instantly. I will come alone. Debo! You are having feeling for a girl? You are admiring good things? Don't you know you can't have a woman without money? You? You see? Segun has snatched your girl. They know you are wretched. You collected all the money Tiger gave me. Can't you hustle for more? Listen to me... If Tiger won't help you, you better go and work with Snake. To avoid this kind of embarrassment. Debo, use your brain. You are standing here a with a birthday card... You think a woman will accept this rubbish from you? Your mates are spending money and you are here with this rubbish. If you don't have money... No woman will stay with you. This place looks so horrible. Oh my goodness, people actually live here? Yep, they do? Stop the car, that's Debo. - Amara, I don't think that a good idea. - Oh, that's him. Can you stop the car please, I saw him back there. - Okay... - Can you back up a little bit? Okay. Okay, just relax. Oh, my goodness. Yeah, he was standing there. Can you open the doors? I saw him right here. Let's go check there. Amara, are you sure this is a good idea? Yeah, he was there. - Are you sure you saw him? - He was there a second ago. I saw him with another guy. Hello! Weldone, madam. Weldone, how much do you need? Actually, I really don't want to buy any puff puffs. I was wondering if you have seen a 16 or 17 year old boy. His name is Debo. He was standing here a second ago. Good morning ma. - My dear., how are you? - I'm fine. How much? Two hundred naira puff puff. Two hundred. Thank you. How's your mother? She's fine. Let me give you extra. Be a good boy. No problem. - Your change... - Yes. I was saying... - I was wondering if you saw a 16 or 17 yearold boy... - Bye, good boy. His name is Debo. He was standing right here. I was wondering if you could... Madam! I want to buy one thousand naira puff puff. Okay, now you come. Thank you. This one is here speaking big grammar. Madam! We are searching for a young boy... His name is Debo. - Please, do you know where we can find him? - What's the matter, are you Police officers? Not at all. We are not Police officers. Please, do you know where we can find the boy? I would have offered to take you to their base... But... There's too much trouble in this community. What about their parents? Where are their parents? Parents? Parents that are unsettled? In this community? Everyone is trying to survive. Mother, father, children... All of them are hustlers. As for me, I have instructed my children not to go anywhere near Snake. Or I'll deal with them. Who's Snake? Do you know who Snake is? Parents! - Let's just... - Go this way. It's probably somewhere around there. Debo! Debo! What have you done now? Who's there? It's me, Chairman. Segun? Yes boss, it's me. What's up? How far? I'm alright. Did you come alone? Yes, I'm alone... I was very careful on my way here, no one followed me. Come in. Incantation! I am Nnamdi Ozuruigbo! AKA, Snake... Snake that bites a tortoise. A live Snake. - Sorry, Boss. - Don't be annoyed, please. We missed our way. Come back here. - You missed your way? - Yes, Boss. You are not suppose to enter everywhere, even while you are lost... So that you won't meet your demise, do you understand me? Yes boss. Now, get out! Guys, be fast. If a dime gets missing, you will too. What are you saying? Calm down What's an outsider doing here? I've been informed, Snake. Really? I see. You are the one that followed them to an operation and got hit by a car? Yes, Sir. I was told you are a sharp boy. He's sharp. That's how it should be, based on who your Uncle is. After all, you are related by blood. Yes. You have been with Tiger... It is time for you to be with Snake. When the going gets tough, the tough gets going. They say, business before pleasure... But I mix business with pleasure here. I know yourUncle doesn't allow you to have fun... There's nothing like that here... Choose one. Ehn? - The boy doesn't understand? - He said you should choose one of the girls. Point and kill, look at them. Everything is fine. Everybody should go to work... Good afternoon, Ma'am. My sister! I want to buy puff-puff. Good afternoon. - How much? - One hundred naira. I will add extra today. Thank you. Thank you. Mama Cletus, I was wondering if I could assist you with something... I want to buy fifty naira puff-puff. Where's your money? My mother says she will give you tomorrow. Tomorrow again? You are to fond of credit in this community. I will give you.

Eight thousand naira. Alright. You want to buy it all? Yes Ma'am, I want to buy everything. Should I pack it? Yes, Ma'am. That's ten thousand naira, can you just pack everything now, so we can go somewhere quiet and talk? No problem, I will pack everything. This kind of miracle! I need to talk to you, so can we please go somewhere quiet to talk? Yes, I know where to take you to. Very quiet place, you'll like it. Perfect. Thank you. Do you need any help with that? No need to stress yourself. Oga, do you still need the ponmo? I need ponmo, one thousand naira ponmo. Sister? Where's that brother that comes here with you? Oh, he was pretty busy today, so he couldn't make it here. I thought you said... I thought said this place is going to be super quiet. It's so noisy and loud. It's not noisy here, sister. This is the most quiet place in this neighbourhood... Just manage it. Are you kidding me, why is this place so loud? - I'm trying to have a private conversation here. - No quiet. What's happening here, who are you? What is she saying? Wait, Tiger... - Is she not the same girl that speaks phonetic? - Excuse you, stop calling me that. Excuse you. She's the one. She can't change. You're so rude. Please... Oga Tiger, please forgive her. She's new here. Stand up Mama Cletus... - She's being childish. - Your accent irritates me. What are you doing here? Not like it's any of your business. I'm trying to have a private conversation with Mama Cletus about helping the children in this community. Can I have my private conversation in peace, please? This girl is very rude. Wait, let's help you out. What are you doing, can you just stop? What is wrong with you people? Can you stop? Can you stop doing that? Is it not your birthday? - It is only during their birthday... - It is not my birthday. Rich people like you only come here for clout. Exactly. You want to come and take pictures of sufering ghetto boys to post on all your social media handles. You are so annoying and arrogant... What's wrong with this girl? - You are overstepping your boundaries... - Leave her, let her be. - You are arrogant... - Shut up, do you know these people? Where do you want to touch her? If you touch this one, she will collapse. I shouldn't have followed you here. He is so irritating. Egotistical and just downright obnoxious... Don't tell me you are still upset about that guy. He's so annoying... Anyways, I relaly don't care what he thinks... I'm going ahead with my plans and my foundation, Heart of Hope is setting up shop in that community, whether they like it or not. You know you are very stubborn, right? Only about things that matter. Yeah, stubborn. So I have submitted proposals to a bunch of companies abroad, and I'm just waiting for their feedback. And, I'm looking for volunteers. Are you interested? Who? Me? Yeah. Hell no. Why? You're the one who wants to save the world, not me. I can give you some money, though. Money's good. I'll take money. Hey, Soji. What took you so long? I'm so, so sorry. The traffic was crazy. Oh, okay. I bought a different type of rice for you. The one you wanted was not valuable. And you didn't think to inform us first. Gosh, you are so dumb! Give me that. So annoying. Oh my God! My pitch! What is it? My pitch got approved. Oh! That means, my foundation will soon be funded and I can start. That is great. Come here, babe. Thank you, boo. That's good news. What's this change you people are counting? Guy, I don't understand this. Don't be annoyed, things are hard these days. It's not our fault. Be fast. Is that all the money? Yes, it is. Why? Are you guys slacking now? What's the matter? Are you guys tired? No, we are not tired, boss. We are just having a little challenge on the streets. I told you, and Segun just disappeared without traces. Even his mother came looking for him too, he's gone missing. May the god of iron kill you. You are mad. Thunder will fire your... Are you mad? What's the meaning of that nonsense? I'm complaining about my business, and you are here telling me about Segun and his mother... How's that any of my business? What's the matter? Boss, I was informed about a woman trying to conince our boys to get educated. There's a woman trying to convince our boys to get educated? Does education guarantee success? So our boys can get education they won't need? Is she blind to the empowerment happening through us? Did she not see how our boys are living good lives? What's the purpose of getting education? This woman has nearly convinced all our boys... And why am I not informed earlier? I didn't know it will get to this level, I was trying to run it my way. Forerunner! You wanted to run it your way? So, why didn't you run it successfully? Master runner! I will run into you. Don't ever joke with my bussiness... Do you hear me? In fact, everyone should leave, get out of my sight. Get out! Nonsense! I will stab... Hey you... Machine! See... Don't make me regret introducing you to my business... I get angry at little things. I am Snake... AKA, Live Snake. I am not Tiger... I swear, I am not Tiger... Anybody that misbehaves will be dealt with... Don't joke with my business. What's that nonsense? How will you be here, and my business is not booming... Do you want me to stab you? Are you a mad person? You people should focus. I hate repeating myself. You people should focus before I get mad at you. Mad People. And as for that woman... As for that woman taking away our boys... Take her down anywhere you see her. It's an order. Take her down anytime you see her in this neighbourhood. Get out! Confirmed, boss. Get out! Mad People. What's going on here? You haven't heard? Poison! Poison! Please leave. Heard what? You've not heard? Watch football. Someone whose house is on fire does not play game. Poison, please leave. You haven't heard the lastest update... Okay, what's the matter? What's the matter? That your Debo... That egg you have been pampering... Snake has cracked and fried the egg. Debo now works for snake. See the way I was paying attention to her lies - For real... Are you kidding? Please, let's continue our game. You are probably drunk. I look like a comedian now? Change your drug supplier. Okay, don't worry. I knew you wouldn't believe me. Who is this? Check it, is this not your Debo, or does it look like a photoshoped picture? Is this not your Debo? He now works for Snake... Did I not warn you? You disreagrded my warnings... Have you seen it now? Check it! Is that not your Debo? I told you... I warned you to be very careful... I'm always with you everyday, do you want me to die here? Try and reward me. - Don't you enjoy it? - I don't, I said you should reward me... Ah! Ah! Ah! I'm sorry sir. Who is this one? - Who are you? - Tiger! Are you mad? Tiger! Get the fuck... Get out. You? No, wait first... Where's Debo? He's with Snake, he works with him now. Snake? Mad man... That's where Debo is, and you are claiming to be his mother? What is your problem? Ehn? Is that how a mother should behave? You can't take care of your child? Listen... Anytime I come here and I meet any of your riff-raff... I swear... You won't like what I'd do to you. Ah! Ah! Okay. He will come here and shout like a mad fellow. It's alright... You want to be the successful one and leave us in penury... Don't worry, we will be successful too. Hello kids, so I need you to practice all that we've been learning, okay? When you get home practice, practice, practice, okay? Tiger, what brings you to my doorstep? Why are you constituting nuisance on my territory? What's going on? Even if you don't have respect, you are suppose to fear me. Snake! I will be the one to allocate a territory to you in this neighbourhood. That's a lie. Everyone knows that I am the king of Onigbo community. Confirm! Do you want to contest? Tell me now, do you want to contest or you want to see blood? Snake! Where's Debo? Are you here because of him? You are here because of Small? Small? Why did you come with all these people? You call my nephew Small now? You are dull. Small! Small! Don't you see that he's now fresh? You turned him into a slave. Don't you see that I've cleaned him up? Rubbish! Debo! Sir! Come to this side. Uncle, I'm not going anywhere. - Let's go. - I said I'm not coming with you. Debo, are you insane? Don't threaten me. Do you want to kill me? Do you want to kill me? - Tiger! - Debo! Uncle, you are wicked. You didn't put me on, and now that Snake did, you want me to leave him... I am now a street boy. I have trained him well. Tiger! Tiger, what's happening here? Let's kill someone. Welldone, killer. How many people do you want to kill? - You know I like you? - Guy, I don't like you. You are messing up. You ought to be with a cartel that's functioning... You are following this sore looser. We are meant to be together. Tiger! You are supposed to be with the winners, not this looser. I will deal with you, are you mad? Tiger, let's kill people here. Are you mad? Leave here now. Snake! Snake! We don't do peace talk here. Ah! Debo! Get out! Debo, you! Guys, let's go. Do you know... I like as you refuse to follow your Uncle. You are now a strong man. Atleast, he knows his position now. Tiger! Tiger! Is it true? Is Snake telling the truth about you? That you are old... Are you getting tired? We've all been thing about it. The reason people fear the name “Tombra Tiger”... Is because you don't take shit from no one. But today... Today, you were brutally disgraced by Snake. Tiger! If you don't take any action... to redeem your name quickly. Then that name... Tombra Tiger! Is dead. Mess up. Hello! When? Pick it up, I will come for it later. You are correct. Snake... Was once my blood brother. That's why I was withdrawing earlier. But as things stand... We're going to cut the snakes head off. So close. Amara! Please listen to me. You cannot go back to that place again. I have to go back there. If anything had happened to you, your Mom will have my head. If she even knew that I took you to such a place, she would have... Mom's not here though. Well, maybe she's not here, but, it's... I am only going to be here for three months. Yes, but I cannot risk anything happening to you, Amara! You can't go back to that place again. Oh, shit. I forgot. Hey, baby. Yeah. I'm so sorry I couldn't make it today. Hey, how about we do a sleepover tonight? Yeah, I'll be there in a little bit. Alright. Love you. Bye. I'll drop you off. Soji, you can go home. It's fine, it's been a crazy day. I insist, I'll drop you off. You know what? Fine. I'll just go take a shower and then I'll come back. You should probably take a shower, too, because it's been a long day. Yeah, I'll see you in a little bit. Alright. Coming baby. What are you doing? You need to stop doing this. What are you talking about? Acting like everything is okay when it's not. Tutu, please, whatever it is, you need to go. Amara is on her way. Please, you need to go. She's seen me here before. We can just lie to her again. Oh, my God! Look, please, stop playing these silly games. The bay is still in there, if that's what you want to know. You need to take it out. The only thing I need to do is to start taking more fruits and vegetables... I hear it's good for the baby. Is this a joke to you? Do I look like I'm laughing? Tutu, you can't do this, please. Amara will be greatly devastated. Do you remember how you told me you wanted me to have face to face and break the news about us to her? I'm sorry. I'm tired of your stupid, endless apologies. It's about time you tell Amara about us or I will. I'll do it myself. Hello, Soji. Please, where are you? Can you come back and pick me up, please? Yeah. Hurry, I'm waiting. Thank you. Are you sure you did not see anything? No. Nothing at all? No. By the time I got there, she was gone. I thought she had changed her mind about staying... That's why I came here to confirm. Guys, I still can't reach Amara, and now her phone is switched off. Come... Are you sure you don't have anything to do with this? You think I'll kidnap my best friend because of you? You slept with me, and now you are trying to blackmail me with a baby. I don't know what you can and cannot do anymore. Incantation! Stop, Stop, Mufu! Let me go or you'll be in a lot of trouble. Are you deaf or something? Let me go right now. I don't want your damn food. Let me go. Please, please, can you wait, please? I really need to pee, please. I've been holding it all night. Please, can I use the restroom, please? You are going to have to untie me. I can't walk my legs tied... To the bathroom. Please. You? You will not scream if I take off the tape. If you do... I'll put it back. I'll leave you here tied up for days, and I will not return. Do you understand? Do we have a deal? Good girl. Ouch! How much you want? Classic. That's clichéd, don't you think? You should be smarter than that? You think I kidnapped you because of money? What else could you possibly kidnap me for? To save your life. Excuse me? You think it's everybody that's happy about what you are doing? Trying to help the youth in the community... To give them a better life... You think everybody is happy with that? Your life, was in danger. And being kidnaped by a total stranger who could possibly be a rapist or a murderer is... Keep shut! Who is a rapist? Did you just called me a rapist? You? You think you are my type? There are a lot of women out there, who would rape someone like you? You think you are beautiful? If you ever call me a rapist again... I'm sorry. Can you take me home now? If I'm really in danger, I should not be in this community... I should be home, my mom's pretty powerful... She'll protect me. Can I go home, please? Only if you promise not to return to this community. What? I know you are stubborn, you won't listen. No, no, no! I'll stay away from this community, I promise. But, can I please go home? And if you're not doing this for the money, then you'll let me go home, please. I'm begging. Okay... I'll take you home... When it's safe. Can you take me home now, please? I'm begging. Please, take me... When it's safe. Please, take me home now. Tell your family members... That Snake is here. Everyone should come outside. To hell with all of you. Stop, are you mad? You are moving while I move, do you want to die? Mufu! Mufu! Come outside. Show yourself. Who is that? Bring that mosquito here. Come here! I will slap you, come here. Go down. Go down! Snake is talking, you are moving. Thank God you didn't tell Mom, I'm on way home already. But what happened? Long story, I'll tell you about it when I get home. You should call Udoka, he's worried about you. - Please, forget udoka. - Help me, Somebody help me! Oh Shit! Help me! Are you okay? - What's going on? - I'm not okay... What's wrong? Snake wants to kill everybody in my compound. Wait! Where are you going? Go and hold her. - Where are you going too? - Wait here. You all don't know where Mufu is? Where is Mufu? - Iya Mufu tell them where your son is. - I don't know where he is, he is their boy. Do you know where he is? I don't know where he is. Amara! I don't know where my son is. Where is your son? I don't know where my son is, I've not seen him in a while. I don't know where my son is. I don't know where my son is. After the count of three... If you don't call out Mufu or whatever his name is... I will shoot one person every five minutes. Jesus! To prove that I am not joking here. You have a gun? Who's Mufu's mother? Where is Mufu? Where is Mufu? - Where is Mufu? - Iya Mufu, tell them where your son is. Where is Mufu? Iya Mufu, tell them where your son is. Where's Mufu, two! Three! Amara! No! No! No! You and who? Customer! Careful! Let's move! No! No! Ah! Sorry. Sorry. Please relax, don't try to get up. Oh, my God! Sorry. Snake! Sorry. I need to go. - I need to... - Oh no... You can't get up. You need to relax, please. You relax. Did you do this yourself? Yeah, I had... I had first aid training in the U.S when I was running my foundation out there. So yeah, I did it. Okay. You can't get up, you're hurt. You've lost a lot of blood. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I told you, you can get up. Can you relax, please? Just lie down. I don't understand, why is Amara not talking to me or telling me where she is? I don't know. Did both of you have a fight? No. Did you say something to her? Tutu, did you tell her anything? - Because, I swear to God, if you did... - Hey. Hey. You know what? What is going on here? Tutu! You know what? I don't want to talk about it, not now. So why did you do it? Do what? Save my life? You don't even like me. And yet you put your life in danger for me. Why? I like and admire what you're doing for the kids in the community. If... I mean, nobody did that for me when I was their age. If somebody had done that, then... Maybe... Maybe I won't be kidnaping annoying girls. Plus, You saved my nephew's life, I... Had to repay the debt. You can consider yourself debt free. How's your shoulder? It's just there. Have some more. No, thank you. Thank you. Alright. How about you eat it later? Yeah! Okay. UD baby is calling you again. Yeah. Boyfriend? Fiance. Well, okay. That's nice. It's like he messed up I'm sorry, what did you say? What I mean is... It's like he messed up or you did something wrong. Yeah, he... He cheated on me with my best friend. Wow! And now she's pregnant. Are you serious? Yeah. Oh, that's bad. You have no idea. Oh, trust me, I do. Yeah? Yes, I have been betrayed. By your girlfriend? Worse. By somebody I... consider my brother. Blood. Snake. The guy that shot you? Yeah. Poison, Snake, Tiger... You all have really weird names. Look... I have to go now. Yeah, I probably should leave too. Not now. Tonight... Hi hi captain. Good I think you need to change, you have blood all over your body. Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah. Sorry. How will you say you don't know his whereabout? Are you not supposed to be his shadow? Poison, I don't know why you are pestering me I have explained to you. Don't you know how Tiger does his things? He did inform me about his movement... Which means, he didn't want me to follow him. What do you want me to do? Just calm down, why are you so worried? Is it not tiger? We are at war. My thoughts shouldn't just come to pass. Relax. It shouldn't be what my mind keeps telling, we are at war. Eh! Eh! What? Tiger! JT! What happened? Where were you? What happened to your hand? Tiger! What happened? Snake. I said it! Snake? That guy is a bastard, if I don't kill that Snake... If I don't destroy his face... You too... Why did you leave without your assistant? How did you manage to escape? Some area boys rescued me and cleaned up my wound. Area boys? And they cleaned up your wound like professional? Poison, I don't have time for all these talk. I just want to rest. Wait Tiger... Snake did this, what's the next step? Do we just sit and fold arms? What's our next move? Jay? Snake has fortified himself. I shot him and it didn't penetrate. My Father! He has been fortified. So, how do we fight him? It's getting serious. I'll think about that later, I need to rest first. Jay, take care of everything, please. Hey! You can go home now. And don't come back. But my kids... No, not until it's safe. But it will never be safe if Snake is still here. Yes, of course. Working on something to fix that. How? What are you working on? The lesser you know, the better. You're not thinking about taking the law into your hands, are you? You're not thinking about saving me, are you? I'm serious. Okay. I'm a man... Too set in my ways. Maybe, but you can change that. Look... I can talk to my mom, she knows a lot of people in high places. Please let me help you. Is that a yes? How many times have I told you how stubborn you are? Probably told me like, a gazillion times. So, I'm telling you one more time. Let me get your number, so I can call you. Okay. I'll call you. Oh! And... Thank you, thank you for saving my life. And, I'm so sorry for totally misjudging you. It's fine. Alright. Goodnight. Hope no on one followed you? Are you kidding me? No one followed me. Snake is searching for you. I know. Mufu, what is the matter? Why did you steal Snake's money? I did not steal Snake's money. I did not steal Snake's money. Guy, you don't have to lie to me. Snake has promised to forgive you if you come back to him. I don't believe you... Snake cannot forgive me. Why will you say that? The issue is that... I was at the wrong place at the wrong time. That's how I got myself in this trouble. What does that mean? Debo... Nice one. I trusted you and you betrayed me. Mufu, you messed up. Why did you steal his money? He's always helping us. I did not steal his money. I just... See no evil. Say no evil. - Soji! - Amara! I am so sorry, it's a long story. I am sorry. That is what you keep saying all the time. I am so sorry. I am just glad you are home safe. Thank you for not telling mom. I am really grateful. Amara! Hey! Baby! Baby how are you? are you... Do not touch me please! - Baby! - What is he doing here? What am I... He called a few minutes after we spoke and I told... What are you saying? are you okay? I've been calling your phone! Can you let me go? Stop pretending, Udoka! - Pretending? - Yes, stop pretending! How am I pretending? Pretending about what? What is she saying? I don't understand! Baby! What are you doing? Have a good life with Tutu and the baby. Soji, I never want to see this man near my house again. Get out! Amara... Excuse! Let me... Amara! Baby! Just go. Let me... Just go. Debo! Debo! Debo! You did well today. You killed him. You killled Mufu! No! I did not kill him. We killed him. How did they say it in police station? Accompanies or accomplice? There is company in it. We both did it. But relax. There is no problem. Go. Go! Debo! See no evil! Say no evil! - Hello... - Hey Tiger, it's Amara. Hey... How's your shoulder? I'll survive. Hey, thanks again I really appreciate you. You know if you keep thanking me like this... And I'll reconsider your position as the most annoying person that I know. You keep saying that, and yet you took a bullet for me. Yeah baby! Let me be your superman! Let me be the one to protect you from ev... I have to go now. Okay, well... - Take care, becareful. - Okay... And... I'll have that conversation with my mom tomorrow and... I'll get back to you. - Alright? - Yeah sure. Okay... don't let the Snake bite! Bye. How far? Everything is set for tomorrow. - Okay. - Okay... Please, not this night. Hey... We need to talk. Talk about what? Tutu... I mean, I know I've treated you mean and... I haven't treated you or our baby properly. Our baby? Did I hear you correctly? Tutu... I am sorry! Amara used love potion on me, I swear. Because suddenly... Whatever she has done has faded. And I can now see the light. Amara is the one who has seen the light. Now that she knows that I am pregnant for you. You know what? I have also seen the light. Yes, it's clear! That the only reason you came back to me heartfully was... Because you couldn't get all the things Amara offered to you After she broke up with you. No... The money she gave to you? No... Her mother's contacts? No! I was such a fool. I was! Tutu, don't be like that. Come on, think about this logically. What about my baby? Our baby? Oh that? The baby is not yours! Sorry what? I had a one night stand with someone. While you were in America making up with Amara. Tutu please... Get away from me! Tutu... Sorry... I am sorry I didn't... Give me a chance because you felt I was beneath you. I was stupid, I was... Wait... Tutu. Are we even sure that this baby is... It is Soji! It is... Tutu! I like you... And I definitely want to be part of my baby's life. But I am not sure that the both of us can. Soji! Soji! No! No, we can't. Soji! No! Soji, come back! Soji! Debo, open the door, I'm tired. I've been knocking the door since and no response. Debo! Madam, what is the matter? I've been knocking since and Debo is not responding... I saw him last night, he should be in that room. - You saw him last night? - Don't you have a spare key? - I don't even know where I dropped it. - Better look for it. Debo! Debo! What's up? Tiger! Where is poison? She stepped out. Everything is ready for this night right? 100 percent. Okay, I just need... I need to... Hello... You said! When? Where's Debo? Are you mad? Where's Debo? He's inside the room. He's inside the room? What's the matter? What? Look at me. Let this be the last time I set my eyes on you. As from today... You are dead to me! Dead! Tiger! Tiger, don't go yet. What? JT... change of plans. We move now! But I thought you said we'll go... JT! Snake has killed Debo! Snake has killed my nephew! Snake! Snake!! Snake!!! Snake has touched the Tiger's tail, he needs to pay. See your life. Tiger, please don't go. Here you go. Thank you so much, Soji. Thank you. You are welcome. Aren't you going to take that? It's Tutu, I don't want to talk to her she's been calling me all day... And I really don't want to talk to her so... Yeah, it's fine. Okay. Would you like me to serve that out for you? No, I'll just eat from here, thank you. Alright. Oh, it's Mama Cletus. Hi Mama Cletus, how is it going? Are you good? Please, you'll need to talk to Tiger... How does he intends to fight Snake with a hand. Fight? Who is fighting? Yes, Debo is dead and... Debo is dead? Debo! From the accident? Debo. Don't you know? I thought you were with him! No! Let me call you back! I will call you back. What... Who are you calling? I am calling Tiger. Tiger! He's not picking. Soji, I... I really need to go. Go where? Where are you going to? You know what, just call Mom and tell her this is really urgent, and she needs to send police officers to Onigbo community right now. I need to go. Wait... Amara! - Just do it now, please I need to go. - Amara! This girl will not send me to an early grave. Snake! Snake! Who's looking for Snake? Snake! Snake! He's here. I have captured him. Snake! Is this necessary? Tiger! Is this necessary? Snake! Snake! You bite me. Snake! Look at us, see the level we got to. We are now turning on each other. Why? How did we get here? Snake! I considered you as my family. I took you in... But what did you do? Like a serpent... You put your fellow on me. I can forgive all that... Snake! You bite my heart when you killed my nephew... I can't forgive you for that. Tiger! You talk too much. May thunder fire you. Poison! Shoot him. Shoot him! I said you should shoot him, Poison. Poison! It seems you are mad. Drop that gun. Poison! What's the matter with you? I will shoot you, drop that gun. Poison! You have the effrontery to talk about being betrayed... Tiger! Do you know what it means to be loyal? Poison! I dedicated my life to you... I was loyal to you till the end... And how did you pay back? You were flirting with another woman behind me. Someone that's not even on the street. She doesn't mean anything to me. You think I didn't see you? Yeah baby! Let me be your superman! Let me be the one to protect you from ev... I have to go now. Poison! No! She doesn't mean anything to me. You think I'm a fool? You are talking to much. JT! - You are talking to much. - Tiger! Oh my God! You are not suppose to kill him, that wasn't the plan. What do you expect me to do to people that came here just to kill me? It's self defense. Get away from my man. All this is your fault, and I will waste... You killed me because of another woman? Please. Please. - Die, Snake! - This joke is too expensive. Don't. Snake... No! Stop, Stop, Mufu! If you don't take any action... to redeem your name quickly. Then that name... Tombra Tiger! Is dead. Hello! I need your help. Snake has given an order to eliminate that girl. When? Right away. What do you want me to do? Kidnap her, I will pick her up later. Tiger! Oh my God! Ah! JT! My blood! Snake! Poison! Sorry. I'm sorry. He shot you. I was wearing a vest. I'm glad you are okay. I'm glad you are okay. I'm glad you are okay, Tiger. It's Tombra. What? My name is Tombra. Okay, Amara. Try telling me you name next time before you try to kill yourself. Oh my God! We need to get out of here. Let's go.
