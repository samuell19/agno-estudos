Some robbers have taken off with them. Don't make a noise; didn't you hear me? Hey Kamla, is the car here yet? Bholu, you idiot, what are you looking for? My goats are all missing. When she lost her husband, she did not go to find him. Why will she bother to find your goat? For God's sake, what are you standing around for? Go, go, look out for them.. Hey you silly fellow, come over here. Don't ask them, ask me. Come here. Your goats must be roasting on Raju's fire place. Keep quiet, you silly goats! Stay together, all of you.. Oh my goodness! Roja, the car has come. Go on, go on, run along.. Hey Kamla! Come here, help me. Come on, come on, run along. He's handsome, isn't he? Oh no, cigarette! Very bad! Fallen in love already, have you? I can leave you behind. I don't mind. Hide! Come on, let's run. Karvatilal, your goats are crowding the road. Have you any sense? They have blocked the car.. ..of the man who has come to see my sister. Go on, hurry up. Go on, get them out of the way! Go on, quick! Be careful. He looks a very intelligent type. If you don't understand anything, ask me, okay? Intelligent! My goats! Go on, you buffoons! Go on, get them. Go, go.. Come on, come on, everyone. Hurry up, hurry up. The bridegroom has arrived. You've to come to see him. Oh, the bridegroom has come. Let's go and see him. Listen everybody. My sister Laxmi's husband to be.. ..has come to see her. Laxmi's groom is here. The bridegroom is here. Come on, come on, everyone. Laxmi, hey Laxmi.. Where on earth have you been? You said you were going to the market to buy vegetables. I saw him, Mamma. - Do you know how angry your father is? I saw him. Can you believe it? I actually saw him. How does he look? You be quiet. Mind your own business! He's very fair-skinned, very handsome and he's big and tall. He looks very intelligent, grandma. Must be very well educated. He smokes too.. but he looks like a decent man. I really do approve of him. It's great if you also do approve. Roja, you silly creature! What are you so excited about? Is it your wedding or your sister's? Oh, be quiet, grandma. I want to stay here in the village. I have no wish to marry. But my sister Laxmi will. I should light a lamp to the goddess.. ..for answering my prayers. Hold still, Laxmi. Don't move an inch. Make a wish. Hey, can I make one for you? May this husband be the nicest man in the whole world! May he fall in love with you at the first glance! In four days time we'll have a beautiful wedding ceremony. Then you'll sit with him in his car and leave us all. At that moment, I shall cling to you and cry and cry. Mom, we have come here to see a bride. Why is half the village following us? Specially these old women! Do you want me to select one of them? Very funny. I want a village girl for you. So enjoy yourself. What's the matter? What are you murmuring between yourselves? City people are very private. Well, my brother, what do you do for a living? I am a cryptologist. I don't understand. You mean you make bricks? What do you not understand? He's a photographer. What am I saying? By the way, son, how much do you earn? Sufficient enough. Meaning? One thousand, two thousand.. ..or is it five thousand? Why don't you let us know? Prasad Ram-ji, how come you ask the groom.. ..such a personal question. But I was just.. Just a minute, just a minute, stop, stop! Well, you look fine on the outside, young man. Nothing wrong from inside, I hope. You have left all the city girls and have come.. ..to marry a village girl. That's why we are asking. - Yes. You there, keep quiet. He's picked a girl from our village. We should be grateful. Please, don't misunderstand. Yes, my son. - What wrong have I said? After all it's the matter of our girl's future! Should we not ask? You are an educated man. You tell us. Look, I have ten fingers on my hands. That's not what I meant. If you wish, I can carry you to the house. Oh no, no, son! No! Come on, come on! - Please no, no. Come on, don't be embarrassed. Come on. Oh God! Put me down son, this is very embarrassing, son. Put me down. Laxmi, don't be nervous. If he asks you something.. ..intelligent, give it right back. Don't worry about anything. I've made a deal with all the gods and goddesses. Roja, you wait here. Why, Mamma? Mamma! Laxmi, take her blessings. Come sit. Now if this crowd just keeps hanging around the two of them.. ..then the girl will remain mum! And my son too will.. ..not open his mouth. Let's leave these two alone so that.. ..they can decide whether they like each other or not. Sister, what kind of talk is that? Yes, yes. How can we leave the two of them alone? Sister, it is not allowed. We have allowed the boy to see the bride's face.. ..before the wedding. Otherwise, it is never allowed. Listen, they don't like all these old fashioned village ways. Yes sister, he's a big city man. Wait a minute! She hasn't really said anything wrong. After all, it's the two of them who have to live together. So what's wrong with them having a little chat? Oh my God! Roja, did you hear that? The two of them are going to chat alone! In the last five years, I've prayed everyday to you. The boy who has come to see my sister.. ..please let him say yes. I'll offer you whatever you ask. And just like I had promised, I'll also light a lamp.. ..with pure ghee for you. Whatever happens.. ..just let him approve of her. My son, ask whatever you wish. After marriage, you won't get a chance to ask anything. She speaks from experience. After marriage.. ..her poor husband has become a slave. And he keeps mum. They really can talk, can't they? I was born and brought up in the city. So I have never come to a village. But I had decided that if I ever get married.. ..I'll marry a girl from the village. I seem to like this village. The fields, the waterfalls.. ..the soil, smell of the earth.. These old hags! I love it all. What are these two talking? I can't hear a thing! Why do you want to hear their talk? You don't interfere in their private matter. Look who is talking and acting holier than thou! All your life, you've meddled in other's affairs! What about you? I'd like to hear your voice. Say something. Say 'God is great'. Abuse someone if you wish to! Just say something. This marriage.. This marriage is not possible. What? Come again. Please, speak softly. Please say no to this match. Say you do not approve of me. Hey Laxmi! Don't just keep standing there like a statue. Go on, and offer him a cup of coffee. I'm in love with Narendranath since childhood. I've made up my mind to marry only him. But his father and mine are sworn enemies. So my father won't allow me to marry him. If we cannot marry.. I'll put an end to my life. So please reject this offer. Wait a minute! Then why did you send me all those beautiful pictures.. ..of yourself and dragged me here from so far? You should have told your father about it first. These city men are just never satisfied with talks! My husband is the same. Go, call your father. I'll tell him myself. If he gets to know, he'll throw me out of the house. So what do you expect me to do? If you just keep staring at him without speaking.. ..then this is bound to happen. Only you can help me. Sir, you approve of our girl, don't you? Don't feel shy. You can say what you feel. Oh, come on! How can you not approve of our Laxmi? He looks quite pleased. It's showing on his face. Rishi, you like her, don't you? Shall I give the go ahead? Please, please, please, please, please.. Please, please, please.. I like this girl. Son! How will you ever find peace of mind like this? You've come from the city.. ..studied in the best schools! You came here to approve of the older sister. And now you say you like the younger one! Do you have any integrity in you? What is the use of education? If this was someone else, we'd have beaten him to a pulp! Have you thought about poor Laxmi? Who'll want to marry her now? Who'll want her for a wife? Son, it's a matter of honor for us. Please, do not shame us like this. That's all I have to say to you. I've always been warning you not to let her go prancing around! But do you ever listen? Now look what has happened! The silly girl has ruined her sister's life! What have I done? Tell me, what were you doing in that room? Your mother had told you not to go there! Why are you scolding her? She's still a child. What wrong has she done? What? You don't think she has done anything wrong? She was standing there like a temptress! Now he wants to marry her only! Please don't scold me for nothing at all. Do you know I've been praying everyday for Laxmi to get married? Marriage is a personal matter. Forget what other people think. If the boy likes Roja, then let him marry her. Grandma, I don't want to get married. Shut your mouth! You've done enough damage as it is! She's not really that young anymore, my son. We don't get boys like this everyday. If he has chosen our girl, we should consider.. ..ourselves fortunate. Our Roja too has grown up now, hasn't she? She's got to marry someday. I know that, mother. But how can the younger sister.. ..marry before the older one? I do have someone in mind for our Laxmi. Without further delay, let her marry Swaramnath's son.. ..Narendranath and end the matter. And forget all these years of enmity? All the humiliations he has caused? Have I no dignity whatsoever? That's right. You're sworn enemies. You have crossed swords with the father.. ..so now you expect your children to do the same too. Don't do that. Think about their future. They too need a life of their own. Stubbornness and pride will lead you nowhere. Please don't break their hearts. Listen to me, my son. Listen to your old mother of yours. Go on. Let both marriages take place together. "Rukamani, what was it like on the wedding night?" "Who lost? Who won? Peep in through the window." "Rukamani, what was it like on the wedding night?"

"With arms in arms, they are having sweet talks.." "The bed has started to creak slowly.." "It rocks to and fro, things are steaming up." Brother, we are very grateful to you. We shall never forget what you have done for us. This was God's will. Where is Roja? - She is inside the house. No, she is not there. - She is not? God bless you. "A small hope lies in my tiny heart!" "An innocent hope in my euphoric heart!" "A hope to reach the stars." "A hope to fly free in the skies." "A small hope lies in my tiny heart!" "An innocent hope in my euphoric heart!" I do hope you'll enjoy the dish I'm preparing. Do you think this much salt is enough? No, that's too much. Your grandmother says you cook very well. She says you can whip up a banquet for thirty people.. ..in just thirty minutes! But my Rishi is not a fussy eater. He is all the time preoccupied with his books.. ..and that wretched computer! And if it's not that, it's music. He sits in the toilet reading the newspaper and.. ..figuring out the crossword. I've told him a hundred times not to do it.. ..but still, he just doesn't listen to me! Don't pick on the food while its still cooking! God knows when he'll stop smoking! What's the matter? - Nothing, mom. Hey.. Sorry. I didn't.. I didn't do it on purpose. I am sorry. S-o-r-r-y. Are you angry? I said I am sorry. Look at me. You know I'm not such a horrible person. In fact, I'm quite a nice guy. Don't I look like one? I'm taking you to meet my chief, Dr. Chandra Mohan. You know, we create computer software for the Indian military. We also encode and decode a whole lot of.. ..confidential files for them. We need to have high security.. ..clearance for everyone who works in that department.. ..including the family members. That's why I'm taking you to meet him. Have you heard anything I've just said? Wait here. Come in. All right. Next Saturday. Is it very cold there? No problem. I'll be there in Kashmir. Two, three days are more than enough. I'll handle the courts once I am there. Okay? Thank you. Hello, Rishi! Congratulations! Thank you. Sir, this is my wife. - Where? Why are you standing here? You asked me to wait here. Okay, come in. Come, my girl. I'm Rishi's chief but only in the office. Name's Chandra Mohan. I think he's very lucky.. ..to get a wife like you. Sit down. I hope you have married him out of your own free will. What did you say your name was? - Roja! I didn't ask you. Now, can I have a conversation here please? Which village are you from? - Sir, it's a very small village. My village is not small. I'm from Sunder Bhanpur. Sunder Bhanpur district! Oh! She's from my village! That's why she has that glow on her face. Its been ages since I've met anyone from my village. And this boy.. My girl, he's a total city boy.. ..from head to heart. By the way, is the Mumbadevi temple in our village, Roja? Yes. I mean not in our village.. ..it's 20 miles south of our village. All the girls visit the temple during the festival of flowers. That's in autumn, right? No, it's during the monsoon. We girls collect our flowers in baskets.. ..and then travel by bullock carts to worship the goddess. It must be wonderful. Sir, I've got her for the security clearance. I'm your chief. I know why you have brought her. He must be bossing you around too! Am I right? So, are you missing the village? Yes sir. What did he tell you about me? He said, "Don't talk to my chief. Just be quiet." "If you open your mouth, then you'll display your innocence!" - Ignorance! Ignorance. Just because this man is educated, don't let him.. ..bully you! Listen mister, this girl is from my village. She is not afraid of anyone or any thing! Understand? Roja, do you know how to sing those old folk songs? Sir, what about the security clearance? There is no need for that! She's from my village. She doesn't need any clearance. Listen, can you sing some old folk songs for me? I have some fond memories of these songs. Maybe some of them. I'm leaving for Kashmir and will be back by Monday. As soon as I'm back, I'll come straight to your home. And I want to hear you sing all those favourite songs of mine. What's the matter? She should be saying.. "You're most welcome. I'll be waiting for you." I won't be here next Monday. I'm going back to my village. We've just been here for four days. What's the problem? I want to go to my mother. For 18 years, you've been hanging on.. ..to her apron strings! Wasn't that enough? I'm missing my village. Every time you miss it, you can't just go running off, Roja! Now this is your home. Do you understand? No, this is not my home. I don't like it here. I feel uneasy. I am not supposed to be here. This is my sister Laxmi's house. You've done her a great injustice. Oh! So that's why you are angry. No wonder you've been sulking all this while! Don't you have a heart? Put your hand on your heart.. ..and tell me! Would any decent man do.. - Listen.. ..what you have done? You'd not get a girl like.. ..my sister in a million years. Even if you were.. ..to search the whole world! - Listen Do you have any idea what a woman feels.. ..when you agree to a marriage and then suddenly.. ..you point at me and say that I'll marry this one? Can you understand what she must have felt? Now, how will I look my sister in the eye once again? I can explain you.. - This is going to hurt me my whole life. The entire village practically spat in my face and.. ..abused me as if I was the one seducing you all this while! Won't you at least listen to me? Just because you're educated, you can do as you please? You're not understanding, Roja.. You can treat us like dirt? What did you think before you said in front of people.. ..if not this, then this girl? - Listen to me, Roja, calm down! As if we were vegetables at the market! For God's sake, listen to me! I did not reject her, Roja. She was the one who rejected me. This marriage is not possible. - What? Come again. Please, speak softly. Please say no for this marriage. No! This cannot be true. She would never say a thing like that! Hey Laxmi! Don't just keep standing there like a statue. Go on, and offer him a cup of coffee. I'm in love with Narendranath since childhood. I've made up my mind to marry only him. But his father and mine are sworn enemies. So my father won't allow me to marry him. If we cannot marry, I'll put an end to my life. So please reject this offer. I still can't believe this! That's the truth. Whether you choose to believe it or not.. ..it's up to you. I just spoke to Laxmi on the phone. She's very happy in her new home. She says I should worship you like a God. Without knowing the truth, I got upset with you. Please forgive me. I swear to God, I am sorry. S-o-r-r-y. I'm not such a horrible person. I'm quite nice, actually. You do forgive me, don't you? Hello.. Yeah.. When? Which hospital? Okay, I'll be there. What happened? Dr. Chandra Mohan has been admitted in Remedy Hospital. I'm going to see him. What happened, sir? Don't be bothered by all these gadgets! They're just an excuse for the doctors' huge bills. Will you do something for me? - Definitely, sir. I was to leave for Kashmir on a very important assignment. I don't think I can make it now. You'll have to go in my place. What will I have to do? In Baramullah, at the Unit's South Post.. ..all messages from foreign nations are intercepted. You'll have to decipher coded messaged. You think you can handle this? It's better if you go early so that the.. ..intern there will explain everything to you. I think this is a very good assignment for you. Definitely, sir. In the current circumstances, I feel very awkward.. ..sending you to Kashmir. - Why sir? Kashmir is in India. Why should we be afraid of going anywhere in India? Thank you. Thank you, Rishi. All security arrangements.. ..have been made by the military. You don't have to worry at all. Okay sir, no problem. Roja, remember your promise. You still have to sing for me. Only if you promise to get well soon, I'll sing for you. Rishi, she's a nice girl. I've called your father. He'll take you to your village. Now you can happily go to your mother.. ..and come back when you feel like it! Are you happy? But what will I do in the village? Please don't leave me here. Take me with you, please. To Kashmir? I've already apologized for my mistake. Stop all this talk now and get ready to go home. Ma, come with me, please. - Where? Please come - What's the matter? What happened? You'll know in a minute. Ma, please tell him not to leave me alone. Ask him to take me with him. Rishi, its not even a week since the wedding! Don't leave her like this. Ma, I know what I am doing. Think about it. She's a young girl. You're newly married. Take her with you. My bag is also packed and ready. Why is there no one on the roads? - Curfew. What? - Curfew. No one is allowed on the roads. Why? - Security. There're too many terrorists around here. To keep them in control. It's frightening. Where we are going? "These beautiful valleys, this open sky.." "Where have we come? O my beloved?" "My heart has bloomed like a bud in these blossoms.." "I've got you; I've got every happiness.." "Your lips dazzle with beauty.." "Your cloudy tresses decorate your cheeks.." "The wind is fragrant with the scent of your veil.." "Your body is like polished marble.." "Sweetheart, I am your moonlight.." "Sing some melody of love tonight." "These beautiful valleys, this open sky.." "Where have we come? O my beloved?" "This is the bond of love; see that it doesn't break." "This is an association for all births; let it not loosen.."

"I feel like settling you in my heart.." "Let me make you mine in this naughty night.." "Why are these storm clouds hovering on my chest?" "I'll love you will my heart, my lover, my darling." "These beautiful valleys, this open sky.." "Where have we come? O my beloved?" "My heart has bloomed like a bud in these blossoms.." "I've got you; I've got every happiness.." "My sweetheart, I am your moonlight.." "Sing some melody of love tonight." "These beautiful valleys.. - This open sky.." "Where have we come? - O my beloved?" "These beautiful valleys.. - This open sky.." "Where have we come? - O my beloved?" Roja! Roja! Roja! Roja! Mansingh, have you seen my wife? I'm not sure, sir. Roja, Roja.. Have you seen my wife? My wife.. did she go out? I'm not sure, sir. O God of Kashmir! I don't know your name.. ..but my father says that all Gods are one. So I've come to you. You know my plight, don't you? You're the almighty. You know everything. Before leaving my village, I fought a lot with my God.. ..and I told him I'll never worship him again.. ..because he made me marry such a man. I even told him that I wouldn't even look in his direction! But now I realize what a good husband he's given me. Thanks to him. O God of Kashmir.. ..Please send this message to my God.. ..and please accept this coconut. You'll speak to him, right? You won't forget, will you? Oh Lord, this is going to be a problem. You can't even break a coconut in Kashmir. No, you can't! Who is it? Is it the God of Kashmir speaking? - Yes. You speak English? I speak all languages. Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada.. ..Hindi, Urdu, English, German, French.. ..Greek, Arabian, Persian. I can tell you your past.. ..your present. I can even tell your future. You are married, aren't you? - Yes. I am Chajju Maharaj from Polachi. Well known tourist guide, astrologer, travel agent.. ..allopathy, homoeopathy, Ganapathy, Laxmipathy.. ..psycopathy! I am the jack of all trades.. ..All in one, one in all! Come, come, show me your hand.. ..and I'll tell you your future. Earlier, a lot of tourists used to come here.. ..but now, we get only terrorists. By the way, are you a tourist or a terrorist? Oh no! We have some important work. What is so important that you have come to Kashmir.. ..in such troubled times with your husband? Something big! Cryptology, something like that. I don't know. Is there something like that too? Listen, Roja.. ..I'm leaving for my hometown in a few days. Rail ticket, bus ticket, platform ticket, I've got it all. I can't take all these gun shots and explosions any more. As you can see, my lifeline is already small. Now if you want to know your future, then.. ..you'll have to come to Polachi to meet me. That's him. Oh, your husband! Chajju.. Let him go! Leave him! Please stop! Rascal, do you think the police station is your father's house? Please listen to me, they took him away! My husband.. Don't know where these people come from. Ten twelve people came, abducted my husband.. ..in front of my eyes! Listen to me! I'm speaking over the phone. You go there. Tell me, what is the matter? Some people, they took away my husband in a car. At gun point. Please help me. What is going on there? Don't know, sir. She is telling something in English. What happened now? Calm down, please calm down. They were wearing masks.. ..carrying big guns. Was it a robbery? No, my husband! My husband! Someone bring water for her. Bring some water soon. Please help me. They dragged my husband. Took him away. Calm down, calm down! I can't understand what you're saying! Sit down. I don't want to sit. Right in the middle of the road.. ..they dragged my husband in a car and just drove away. And you want me to sit down? How can I? Wearing masks, with guns in their hands.. ..they just took him away. They dragged him away ruthlessly.. ..and you are not helping me at all! Madam, calm down please and tell me what happened. My husband.. - Yes.. Five ten people.. - Okay. Took him away.. - Abduction? Kidnap! But when? Today morning. Where? -Temple. Mr. Rishi Kumar, a computer engineer from Bangalore.. ..was today abducted by Kashmiri terrorists. This incident took place near the famous Gulmarg temple.. ..early in the morning a few kilometres away from Srinagar. Laxmi, Laxmi, come quickly. Mr. Rishi Kumar who works for the central government's.. ..telecommunications department, had gone.. ..to assist in the Indian Army's Intelligence Division. After his abduction, the Indian army, Border Security Forces.. ..as well as the Jammu and Kashmir police.. ..have come together to search for him. All government departments have been put.. ..on high alert in search of Mr. Rishi Kumar. Brother, I.. Don't hit that girl! - Why did you untie him? How dare you raise your hand on a woman? These are never to be taken off! - A big coward! Shut your mouth! We are not here to give you any trouble. So don't be afraid. But if you act smart.. ..we will have to kill you. It's not a big deal for us. To kill. I am not afraid of death. - Javed. What do you want? What is it that you want? Independence! Freedom! Whose freedom? Our freedom! Freedom for the nation that's Kashmir. Freedom for all the citizens of Kashmir! Everyone's freedom! His freedom, his freedom! My freedom! Freedom for every little wailing child that's born.. ..in this land! Every plant, animal, living being that breathes! Freedom for all of them! Freedom from your slavery! Hello, ma, ma.. It's me, Roja. Hello, Roja. Roja, any news of Rishi yet? Nothing at all. Hello, I have no clue where he is.. ..and in what condition. Hello, hello, Roja, how did all this happen? Some armed men sprang out of nowhere.. ..and just pushed him in their car in front of my eyes, ma. I couldn't do anything. Roja, Roja, don't worry my girl. It's all my fault. It's nothing else, ma. All because he married me. Now, don't you be stupid. I'm coming there.. ..by the first flight I get. No, ma, don't worry. I'll handle this on my own. Please pray at all the temples and speak to Dr. Chandra Mohan. I've already spoken to him. He said there's an important.. ..red alert to all officials and that they will.. ..soon come to an understanding. Paper, paper.. Today's paper.. Sir, today's paper. Paper! Paper! - Ma, I'll call you later. Bye. Here's the money. - Paper, paper, paper, paper.. You'll live another thirty years and.. ..after thirty years, you'll inherit a huge fortune. But now, give me my money. I can't wait for thirty years. Here, take this. What a lifeline! You'll have a long, long life, I say. How much? Chajju! Oh my God! Oh my God! What happened? Where are you going? My lifeline's at stake! Let me go. This is not fair. - She must not see me. I've to go. Let me go. Chajju! Chajju! Why are you running away from me? No, no, it's not what you think, Roja. I have to conduct prayers for Mr. Singh. I was on my way. Can you please read what's written here? It's in Hindi and I can't read a thing! Is everything okay? Read it to me, Chajju. There's nothing in it, really. He's standing there with armed men.. ..and there so much written and.. ..he says "Nothing"! Please read it, Chajju! Wasim Khan is in prison. If in three days they release him.. ..then they'll allow your husband to go. What else is written about his release? If he is not released.. - Then what? Then there will be big trouble. Please read it for my sake, Chajju! If he is not released, then a day later.. ..your husband's fingers will arrive in a parcel. Then next day, by the Shiva temple, all his toes will be found. And within a week, his entire body will be received in bits! That's what these bastards are saying! That's what they are saying. Wait, Roja! Roja, where are you going? Listen to me. I'm also coming with you. Wait. Look madam, if you come here repeatedly, then.. Take a look at this! Read the paper! It's full of threats! Now what do you plan to do? Sir, it's about this article. Can you tell us anything more? See, this case is not in our hands any more. The army has taken over. We can't do anything. Now they will do whatever is to be done. Go to the army. I don't know anything about the army! There are so many uniformed men over here! Just send some soldiers and ask them to look for him! Can't you do that much? Please explain to her, we can't do anything now. Whatever is to be done.. ..will be done by Colonel Rayappa. All right, sir. Roja.. Why are you agreeing with him? Those people have given us only three days! I want to know what they are going to do about it! Roja, there's nothing he can do now. The case is in the hands of the army. We'll have to go meet Colonel Rayappa. Then ask that colonel to come here! Until he comes here, I'm not going to move from here! Roja.. Roja, now don't be stubborn. You heard me. No matter how long it takes.. ..I will not move till I get some more information! Come, sit. Join us for a meal. I.. I hope you like it. Are all of you Kashmiri? What is he saying, brother? I'd like you to know, Rishi. We have no.. ..personal grudge against you. I hope you understand. Eat peacefully. Don't be scared. When your government.. ..releases Wasim Khan, we shall release you. Explain it to him. This is a simple negotiation. As soon as the Indian government.. ..releases Wasim Khan, you'll be allowed.. ..to leave this place intact. That's what they are saying. Did you understand? Eat now. Who's this Wasim Khan? How many people has he killed? I don't agree! They should not release that killer for my sake. What did he say? Nobody has asked for your opinion. Eat. I prefer to die.. Than let you use me as a scapegoat.. ..to release Wasim Khan! Full of pride, aren't you? No! Patriotism! Colonel sir, this is Rishi Kumar's wife. I know who she is. It's been three days since they took my husband away! I have no clue where and what condition he is in! You're a man from the military, a big officer! Yet after so many days, you haven't been able.. ..to get my husband back to me! He has come here under your care! All the forces had taken responsibility for his security. But now that they have taken him away, nobody is ready.. ..to go and look for him also! Please tell me.. ..when will you release that Wasim Khan and.. ..get my husband back to me? Do you know who this Wasim Khan is? I don't care about him! Just get my husband back! He's killed 50 people! If we let him go now, he'll kill another 50! You don't care, do you? I want my husband back. Today if we release him, tomorrow, they'll.. ..kidnap someone else and demand the release.. ..of other terrorists! This place will be.. Who cares about this lousy place? I just want my husband! - Shut up! Who are you? Are you not an Indian? Is this not your motherland? Have you not grown up on this land? Don't you love this land? You're concerned about yourself! Let this country go to ruins! These terrorist forces get together to reduce the nation to ashes.. ..and you don't give a damn! You think of your home.. ..and your husband, but not for your country! Do you know how many soldiers there are in these barracks? 5000! .. 5000! Be it rain, fog, snow, they remain at their positions.. ..never knowing when a bullet will strike them! Miles away from their homes, on the border.. Relentless! If they too begin to think like you, then there won't be any country left! Are you aware what's going around? War! Do you know how many people have died? Soldiers, women, children, all innocent people! And all you are worried about is your husband! In this situation, if it were a minister's son or daughter.. ..in place my husband, would you say.. ..the same things that you've just said to me? Just being a minister's son makes his life more valuable.. ..and my husband's life less valuable? The government has put my husband's life in your hands. If anything happens to him, you'll be responsible! Until you get him back, I won't leave Kashmir. And I won't leave you! Hey, sweetheart! Hey, you're back! I got something for you. What is it? What's it? What's it? What's it? Close your eyes. I'll tell you. Close your eyes. Hey, come here. Give me my clothes. Quickly. Okay, okay. Make it fast or your sweetheart will freeze to death. Not this. My clothes. That's all you'll get, sweetheart. Come out fast. Give me my clothes. Why don't you stand straight? I'm feeling shy. By the way, whose sweater is that? - Yours. Mine, right ? Then give it to me. - What? Take it off. Give it to me! - No! - Come here, come here. No, I can't give it to you. - Hey, listen. I won't give it to you. Come here, give it to me! Take it off! Hey, sweetheart! Would you blush if I said something? It depends on what you say. I love you! Your government needs more time to decide.. ..for the release of Wasim Khan. We have to give proof of your well-being. So record your voice. Come on, speak into this. If Wasim Khan is not released, then you too.. ..will not return alive. Speak! Say! Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Javed! "Roja, sweetheart; you are my love.." "My eyes belong to see you." "Your longing does not leave my heart.." "..how do I live without you?" "You are in my eyes, you are in my tears.." 'If I close my eyes, you are in my heart too.." "In my dreams, in my breaths, Roja." "Roja, sweetheart; you are my love.." "My eyes belong to see you." "The wind feels like your touch.." "The flowers seems to have turned into thorns." "I live with only your love in my heart." "Do I suffer because of my love for you?" "Death wouldn't touch me before our meeting again." "You come to me before the day of judgement." "Where are you? How are you? Roja?" "Roja, sweetheart; you are my love.." "My eyes belong to see you." "You are in my eyes, you are in my tears.." 'If I close my eyes, you are in my heart too.." "In my dreams, in my breaths, Roja." "This cold breeze appears useless." "I wish to shun the moonlight, without my companion around." "The blossoming flowers prick me in absence of my beloved tresses." "The skies seem to mock me." "Without love, my life is sorrowful." "No one is for me. I belong for you." "In my dreams, in my breaths, Roja." "Roja, sweetheart; you are my love.." "My eyes belong to see you." "You are in my eyes, you are in my tears.." 'If I close my eyes, you are in my heart too.." "In my dreams, in my breaths, Roja." Take me to meet Wasim Khan. Who? That criminal? That killer who is in jail? I'll plead with him instead of those government officials. Oh God! Leave me in peace, will you? I can't do this. I have no wish to meet Wasim Khan. Nor do I wish to live in Kashmir. I know a lot of people who'll help me.. ..set shop in my hometown. I'm going. Whether you come with me or not, I'll meet him. Don't be crazy. It's not a good idea. He's a killer. He'll kidnap you too. Do you want that? Will you take me or not? Never. I wish to remain alive. Leave me alone! For God's sake Do we really have to do this? He's coming. He's coming. My heart is beating very fast. Greetings! Salutations! How is everything? Long life in jail! Ask him to release my husband. Sir, please sir. Go on, Chajju. Sir, her husband is with your men. He's innocent. Please let him go, sir. Get out of here. It's just been a month since our marriage. Look at this marital necklace. He's a good man. Is it fair to kill an innocent man, you tell me. You are an Indian and I don't give a damn. Get out. You heard what he said, Roja. Let's go. No, I won't leave. I want my husband back. Your fight is with the government. What's my husband got to do with this? What fault is it of his, tell me? This is jihad. The struggle for Kashmir's independence. You're a murderer. You've mercilessly killed innocent women.. ..and children and that's why you are behind bars. But my husband never came in your way Then why did your men kidnap him? Just tell me why. Your time is up. - Let's go, Roja. My husband is an innocent man. Why are you after his life? If you don't like India, then why don't you just leave? Why are you sacrificing my husband for your selfish means? This is our goal. Our mission and we'll do anything.. ..to achieve it. You call yourself a man? To get out of here.. ..you'll use my husband? How many lives will it take to quench your thirst? Lady, that's enough. Let go. I want my husband. If you try to escape again, I swear I'll kill you. Go there. Usman, take a look here. Go back. How many people have you killed? 20? 25? More than that. Why? For our freedom. Our leaders have chosen this path for us. Who are these leaders? From our country or from across the border? So you'll kill anyone they ask you to? He's your brother. If they ask, you'll kill him? Yes. Your sister? - Yes. Your mother? - Yes. Why? - Jihad. What's that? You won't understand. This is a holy war. Against whom? Against India. You think you can win this war with these guns? Can you achieve your goals by this merciless bloodshed? You've driven thousands of Kashmiri families.. ..out of their homeland? How and where will they.. ..fend for themselves? Is this not their homeland? How will innocent kids survive without food and shelter? Think about it. You just keep throwing parents.. ..and children on the streets and take over their homes. You are.. you are all misguided. Slaves to their orders. Scrambling around with guns.. ..puppets in the hands of the neighbouring country. Can't you use your own mind? Allah has gifted you this life. Why are you wasting it? Why? We don't care about our life. We just want Kashmir. You are trusting a wolf to guard your lambs.. ..and as I said, guns won't take you anywhere. Why don't you try and negotiate with talks? Talks don't help. Partition will solve this. Not again. Not this time. Dear Laxmi, hope all is well at least in your life.. ..not topsy-turvy like mine. I think I must have committed.. a great sin. Otherwise why would all this.. ..have happened with me? I can't take it any more. Everyday I meet these officers in the hope that they have.. ..some news of him. I'm living everyday in the hope.. ..that they will find him soon. Nobody has a clue.. ..of his whereabouts. I fear to think in what condition he's in. We are looking for him everywhere and doing everything.. ..to the extent of showing his photograph to people.. ..in the hope that someone may recognise him. I don't know about the future but what I'm sure about is.. ..that I'm not leaving this place without him. I need your support. Please pray that they find him soon. Roja! How is Roja? Is her groom back yet? Who has taken our dear son-in-law away? If we were there, within minutes we would have.. ..got him back from those scoundrels. Child, is there any news of Roja's husband? What kind of a man are you? Someone has taken her son-in-law away and.. ..you are sitting at home and eating your meals comfortably like a cow? Go and do something. Militant leader Wasim Khan will not be released.. ..in exchange of the computer engineer Rishi Kumar. A highly ranked central government committee.. ..came to this conclusion today. This decision was taken in wake of recurrent demands.. ..by terrorists to get their leader out of jail.. ..in exchange for the abducted high official. Liyaquat, kill this bastard. Kill. His government has refused to release Wasim Khan. Hey! "May our motherland not be destroyed.." "May our motherland not be scattered.." "May no bud wilt here.." "May nobody ruin our land.." "Whether a temple or a mosque.." "Whether a Hindu or a Muslim.." "May them continue to live in love for ever." "From Assam to Gujarat, from Bengal to Maharashtra.." "This is an amalgamation of cultures.." "This is a medley of languages.." "From Kashmir to Madras, say we are one.." "Proclaim; we are one life!" Who? Who is that? - It's me, Chajju. What is it? - Roja,.. ..the colonel wants you to come immediately. Why? He wants you to come and identify. What? What's happened? Nothing's happened Roja. Just come. What are you trying to say? Come along, please. Yeah, you take the charge. You go that side. You come here! Yeah, go there and control the crowd. Yeah, you come here. Don't let anybody in. Why have you brought me here? Someone has been shot several times. Can't even make out his face. That's why I've brought you here. Take.. take a look at him and see. Come. Please, it's not him. It's not him. Go on. It's not him. I won't go there. I can't go there. Come on, don't worry. It's not him. I'm telling you it's not him. Chajju I'm telling you.. ..it's not him. I know. - I'm sorry, but we have to do this. I know it's not him. - Come on. No. It's not him. It's not him. It's not him. I told you, it's not him. It's not him. It's not him. Nothing can happen to him. Nothing can happen to him. We shall have.. - A free Kashmir! We shall have.. - A free Kashmir! We shall have.. - A free Kashmir! Good bye! They are going across the border for training. Sir, sir, this is Mrs.. Mrs. Rishi Kumar. Wife of the engineer who is kidnapped. She just wants to meet the minister for a minute. Mr. Minister has a meeting in Jammu at one. He can't meet anyone. Just give me a written petition.. ..and I'll forward it to him. Sir, I want to speak to the minister for a minute. Can you please take me to him? I beg of you. Excuse me, sir. She is Mrs. Rishi Kumar.. ..the engineer's wife. She wants to talk to you for a minute. My child, I can understand your pain. We're doing our best. You called me your daughter. You do know.. ..that my husband's life is in danger. Please save him. Please save him. - Sir, that's not possible. Sir, I come from a small village in India. I'm not even intelligent enough. Maybe that's the reason why I can't understand politics. We don't have the power to do this, sir. They keep showing me these dead bodies and.. ..ask me if it's my husband's body. I can't take it anymore. They say we are talking.. ..with the terrorists and it will take some time. How can I live with this uncertainty? If something happens to him then? They say he'll be back today, definitely tomorrow. It's killing me. - Sorry sir, I think we should leave sir. It's been so many days since he's gone. We may not be important people, but.. ..we are citizens of India. Is our safety not important? My child, there is not much I can do. You can do everything, sir. You have to save my husband. You are a godsend for me sir. Please don't disappoint me, sir. Please save my husband. It's a request. Okay, I'll take this matter up. I'm going to Delhi tonight. I'll speak to the Home Minister. I will try my best. Last evening while crossing the Indian border.. ..fifteen young armed Kashmiri nationals were gunned down.. ..by the Pakistani army. This betrayal has created bitterness.. ..among the Kashmiri people and has also questioned.. ..Pakistan's double standards in regard to the Kashmir state. Due to this, there is a lot of tension in Kashmir. People have come on the street in Kashmir.. ..and there is a possibility of a curfew. I am sorry. Your brother was innocent. He was a good boy. He should not have died like this. They told us to keep spreading terror and leave.. ..the rest to them.. ..and now they are the ones who killed innocent children. It wasn't.. ..It wasn't just my brother. There were 15 others. All innocent kids. What crime did they commit? They had so much more to live for. We have been betrayed. For so long we have been fighting with you people. Why? All these killings,.. ..this terror, this bloodshed for what? If you realize terrorism is a mistake, why don't you stop it? We can't stop now. We are in the midst of a storm. No matter what the obstacles are,.. ..we have to take our mission to the end. We do not have a choice anymore. This holy war must go on. Liyaquat, you are a stanch Muslim. Then be honest. Is all this terrorism, killing, destruction.. ..acceptable to your Allah? Does your religion say that.. ..one man should kill another? Are we happy with the killings of these innocent children? Why don't you leave your guns? Instead of making people cry, wipe the tears off their faces. He is all right, isn't he? Nothing has happened to him? Right ? Wasim Khan is about to be released. The government has taken this decision. Your husband will be with you very soon. Really? - Really. You pleaded with the ministers, spoke to him.. ..at length and now you will get your due. The man we had captured with great difficulty.. ..will be released soon. Happy? Yes. You know, today I am a very happy man. You'll get your husband; even you are happy. By releasing a big scientist, the minister is getting.. ..a good name in the government. He too is happy. Happy. Very happy, yeah! We went through a lot of trouble to catch this man. Now he'll roam freely. Happy! 15 soldiers, who must be husbands too.. ..sacrificed their lives catching this man. Died for nothing ! But I am happy. I am very happy. Because Wasim Khan will be out to kill some more people. All will be happy. God bless you! Good night. Chajju! He's coming back. He's coming back, Chajju. He's coming back. I told you. My predictions came right for the first time. By the grace of Allah, Wasim Khan will be released soon. At last your government has shown some mercy on you. They have decided to release Wasim Khan. Back to the jeep. Take him back and lock him up. Just make sure that he doesn't escape. No matter what you do; we'll be free one day. You can't do anything to prevent it. This is our Kashmir. Why did they do this? Where is he? Why didn't they bring him along? I thought I'd get your husband back to you. I am sorry. Don't talk like that. He's all right Have you seen anything yet? They are just bloodstained clothes. He's all right. I know that. My heart says that he is alive.. ..That he's all right. I won't give up. Wherever he is, I'll search for him. Wait. Where will you go? I'll go to these terrorists' homes. I'm sure they too have women in their houses. I'll plead with them. If needed I'll fight them. I'm not afraid. I won't be afraid. Wait a minute. I'll come with you. Until you get your husband.. ..I'll be with you. Don't leave him. Let him not escape. I'm coming from the other side. Don't let him go. Hello, Alpha Bravo, Alpha Bravo, Tiger here. Call the 2132 and meet me at 5 o'clock. Over and out. Liyaquat,.. ..now what will you do? You can't kill me. When your brother died, I saw your pain. You're not a terrorist at heart. You're a good man. With a clean conscience. You can't kill me. Wait! I'm leaving. Do whatever you want. Go. Go. This terrorist will wipe tears now. Do you really love me? "India is dearer to us than our lives.."
