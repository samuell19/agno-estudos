(Harikatha, a form of Hindu religious discourse) "Praise be to lord Vishnu" "Praise be to His ardent devotee Lord Anjaneya" Lord of all lords, creator Lord Rama, the supreme ruler With the monkey army in action He entered Lanka with a mission With all his might, Lord Rama killed the demon-army of king Ravana Lord Rama with Sita and brother Lakshmana ...prepared for their return to the kingdom of Ayodhya He hears a feeble voice suddenly 'Oh lord! Help me' 'You have destroyed every single demon' 'Why have You spared Ravana alone?' 'I beg of You to kill him too' Lord Rama rushed immediately entrusting Sita with Hanuman, his devotee Headed to Lanka with his brother Lakshmana In no time in the disguise of Rama a demon approached Sita Sita scrutinized head to toe this newcomer at her door He is behaving strangely He is not my Lord Rama surely She called Hanuman and said 'This Rama please behead' 'Mother, how can I commit this sin? He is the epitome of compassion' The moment Hanuman refused Sita took the mace rage infused She raised her hand in fervor to destroy the demon forever But Hanuman realized then Sita was right in her reason He took the mace from her Decimated the demon soon after Demon in the guise of Lord Rama was killed by the mighty Anjaneya The demon incarnate met his befitting fate Sita must have known about this impostor-demon If Lord Rama himself is wicked, how will Hanuman be devoted To test the devotion of Anjaneya This was a drama enacted by Rama 'Consider it the summary of this enlightening story' 'The Absolute one, consort of Sita' 'Doyen of virtues, Compassionate Rama' 'Consort of Sita, Omnipotent Doyen of virtues, Omnipresent' 'Darling of the people Giver of grace multiple' 'Shower your Mercy on us O' Lord Rama, conqueror of foes' Praise be to Lord Rama Greetings, Bhujang'anna' What's news? Am I a News channel to update you with news? Nowadays trend has changed, right? Girls have given up the traditional attire They prefer T-shirts and jeans So I'm losing business Your shop adjacent to mine is also vacant If you don't mind... ...I can run a ladies’ beauty parlor Finished your orders for ‘Ram Navami’? I've finished cutting all the materials Then why don't you stitch them and sew up your mouth also? Beauty parlor it seems?! Mind your own business! God help me! Is this demon blind? Where are you gallivanting? I'm asking you! I believe she has to attend a special class Why can't you advise her? Her wedding is in May Why go for special class when she's getting married? Is there a rule to-be brides shouldn't study? Let her go No one needs to advise me Teach her a few prayers to recite The groom will be visiting us Teach her to make 'upma' Let her spend the rest of her life preparing ‘upma’ Wonder what she'll do if her fiancé asks for noodles! Ma, if you bring up this 'marriage' topic I'll kill myself Go tell that to your father I'm not telling anyone I won't get married, that's all! Gawd! My brother Nagu, I'll call you later He has just come home Listen, Nagu After he eats and steps out... ...I'll call you Hang up now Be terrified of him all your life Bad enough he doesn't care two hoots for relatives or friends I have just reached here Staying at the regular place Mallika lodge Where is your shooting?

He is jealous He wants to usurp Ravana’s role from me How can I give up that role I’ve been enacting last 10 years? Come to the temple We'll discuss it there ‘Upma’ is real tasty Did you prepare it? She has not yet learnt how to make ‘upma’ Once she does you can get her married! Hey! How old were you when we got married? You were 16 She is 19 now She'll finish her studies in another year Can't you wait till then? We can wait But I won't! Who taught you to say all this? Your brother, right? I know the hush-hush between mother and daughter I notice everything But I keep quiet What's wrong in talking to my brother? You can't stand the sight of him Have you ever wondered why? Does he respect me as his brother-in-law? He tom-toms around the town... ...he has given his beautiful sister to a demon called Bhujangaiyah! I am respected by everyone in this town What does ‘respect’ mean, dad? Respect means the two horns your father has on his head But I don’t see any horn? It is visible only to your father No one else can see it Drink up your milk Drink it up Who is this? Texted you as 'dear' Why did you pick up my phone? First answer me Who is this fellow? Messaged you as 'dear'? We had special class in college Does that give him a right to address you as 'dearrrrr'? Dad, this is how we friends address each other What's wrong?

If the shot is ready won’t he come at once? Which century are you in? We can't go and tell him the shot is ready When he comes we shoot, that's all Hero will come in half an hour it seems Hey! Listen Did the hero say he will meet me?

I told you not to send her to the college I just stepped out to the nearby temple And she has gone Both of you are hand in glove- Proves my words have no value in this house Is it wrong to let her study? Do you know how well educated my nieces are? What did they do after studying?

On the whole my respect is in tatter- 'This is constable Nooka Raju My boss wants you at the station' I should come to the police station?

Is it right for a cop to manhandle a girl student? Why don't you arrest him first? The girl hasn't complained And her family won't either! 'What you did was not a petty crime!' 'You've caused nuisance in public you know' Wow! Such elite people inside our police station! 'Mr Bhujangam...come in' 'What a surprise to see you here!' This is the problem now How do we handle it? Tell me You'll ask me to let them go I can easily do so This is not a big case You guys dare protest against the police? I can excuse them if I want to If it's serious enough I'll put them behind bars Arrest them! Are you teaching me the law? What's wrong in a public protest? My daughter has done me proud Go ahead and arrest Do as I say Haven't you heard of so many freedom fighters who went to jail, huh? Mr Bhujangam knows everything You know I won't stoop so low as to spoil their future No wonder you are challenging me boldly If the picketers were older... …my reaction would have been different Your dreams are very lofty When the time is right anything can happen Who knows, what, where, when or how situations change? Will you release them or not? Shall I make a call to the Home minister?

How can I specify which auto? I lost my bag in an auto and I need my script back Somehow get it back for me 'People in our town are trustworthy' 'You'll get it for sure' Other than honor and self-respect... ...anything else can be retrieved 'I've never in my life stepped into a police station' 'Hearing my name that Ramdas used to pee in his pants' 'I was forced to bow my head in shame in front of him' 'By now this will be the talk of the town' 'Gone...everything is lost' 'Respect and reputation I saved up all these years gone down the drain Ask your husband to stop his tirade As if all those values were assets he inherited from his father! - Did she commit some huge crime? - My bloody fate!

'Let's go' 'Even if he gives it late it will be the latest pattern' 'Unidentified dead body found along the roadside' These reporters have no better work than hunt for dead bodies the whole night That is yesterday's news Your News will scroll today on TV as current headlines Hey! Don't give him any tea Last night he banged on our head constable's door Sir, what do I do now? What happened?

I asked to be arrested trusting you'll be here After I came, I realized you had gone off duty Don't get me wrong That's a long story When I was posted at Kadapa I was on duty for a minister I cracked a joke for which I was suspended! Joke? It was a 3-day duty I said 'when will this nut case let me sleep in peace'? It was heard in the walkie-talkie Some damn reporter published this as News So as punishment I was transferred here That was when I decided, sir Only attend to my duty during working hours What happened to your bag and script?

Why do you use that horn deafening our ears? 'I am screaming my throat hoarse here' How can anyone hear above this din? Where is he? He is even more in a rush than the lorry fellow Goodness! Don't move How many times should I tell you not to make such a racket? Is your hand glued to the horn? Park in front of your house and keep honking 'You'll get a solid shelling from your wife, blackguard' 'If I set my eyes on you again I'll chop your hands, rascal' 'Get lost!'

Only Shiva will know where he is Try calling him again Where are you going? (phone ringing) I have fixed my daughter's wedding Don't make me lose my self-respect Shiva will come tonight Lodge owner Kamath had called You haven't been here for the past 2 days I would appreciate it if you can pay an advance I have been trying all this while I'll get the cash soon Then I'll pay you 1 minute, sir - What should I do now? - Dance on my head!

Please don't joke This is serious She's around 30 years Very good looking Do you know anyone like that? What is her name? Her name...? I don't know, uncle 'At least tell me where you saw her' Behind Goddess Shakthi temple Around midnight, 12:30 That is 'kerosene' Vasu's area Why don't you call Vasu? I beg you, uncle Can you talk to Vasu and let me know? I'll ask around and call you Thanks, uncle Come here, dear Eat 1 more spoonful Do you trouble your mom daily by fussing to eat Isn't that being a bad girl? Not at all Okay, eat Don't use Bhujangam as an excuse and not attend your niece's wedding Come with your family, okay? Is she your wife? As beautiful as a Goddess Why did you go in for all this? The one sitting a little away is your older daughter, right? You're getting her married so early? These men are weird She is so young Why do you want to get her married so soon? Let her study further She must be having dreams of her own Look at me I did not study when I should have Forget all that What's the use of sitting like this? Call someone and get the door open Shall I call constable Vanaja'ka? No need No one should know There is a person I can call A friend I can trust He respects me a lot But it won't be proper to call him here No need to call anyone Shiva will come He must be waiting for the nearby shops to close It's all my fault I should not have got drunk How will I ever face 'anna's' wife? What will I tell 'anna'? Stop it! Stop your overacting How long will I listen to you? Like a broken record! If you are so concerned open the door and say... ...you were the one who spent the night with the girl How can I change my words now? I have already blabbered his family by mistake Get up from there You and your sob stories! What do you think of me? Ranting about your 'anna' and his wife There is a hapless woman in there Did you think of her plight? Who is she? I have no idea, sir Don't know? You have locked up a total stranger Do you know what a huge offense that is? This is enough for you and your 'anna' to be put behind bars Come what may I want my script by this evening Remember Ramdas is my friend Don't tell him, sir Shall I call him? Get out Out! I was trying to call you Coming tomorrow morning? Okay...okay Alright Give my regards to your wife Saroja Same to my brother-in-law See you, ma My father-in-law is visiting us Bhanu, anything urgent call me, I'll come 'Don't worry Where will he go?' 'I am sure he will be back soon' Keep the lamps for the prayer this evening (devotional song) You are already here? Is there a party tonight also? What is the use? Today and tomorrow are dry days Just came out of sheer habit Where is Bhujangam? Not to be seen 'No idea, bro He isn't at home either' 'Must have gone out of town' What is this? You are assembled here Alcohol won't be sold today, right? Anyway Bhujangaiyah won't drink today If Shiva was here we could've got something Where is he? Missing in action Kamath'anna', I saw his auto parked in front of your lodge But Shiva was not there A director had left behind his bag in the auto, huh? Maybe there was money in it And he must be living it up Shiva and Bhujangam are a cunning pair! 'They never disclose what they are up to' 'Only God knows' Shiva is devoted to Bhujangam like Anjaneya to lord Rama He has promised to help Shiva to get a Visa to Dubai In return he's being helpful Shiva is not to be blamed Bhujangaiyah is controlling him 'In his dreams Shiva will go to Dubai!' 'He says he was in Dubai Who knows what he did there' 'Cleaning the toilets or sweeping the roads' 'No one knows' But whatever he did... ...he came back loaded, right? Do you know how he earned all that money? He broke some Sheikh's skull and robbed him of his money What he says is right Money and respect go hand in hand His father used to sell fish in the market 'Such humble beginnings' 'Now look at him' 'He heads the Ram Navami Committee' Listen, friends We are chit chatting here It's time for our deity to be taken around in the chariot Wonder if Bhujangam is already there He might even be insulting us right now over the loud speaker, let's go I'll close my shop and come (quiet sobs) 'Are you crying?' Do men cry? Life is like this Nothing ever happens the way we expect We must set it right with clear head Lord Rama's procession will pass my house very soon And If I am not there... ...the whole town will wonder why How long will you sit like this? Shouldn't we do something? Give me a hand No one will hear this noise in the din outside Ouch! My hand Let me see Come this side 'Don't you want me to live any longer?' 'I'll go kill myself, just say so' What did I do to deserve this? I go around with You even in my auto Only because of me Bhujang'anna' is trapped Help him get out without exposing him Just give me 1 chance I'll rescue them and I'll disappear forever I swear I'll never blunder like this ever again I believe in You I know You won't let me down I vow to break 100 coconuts if You grant my wish Help me, o' Lord Shower Your grace Take all this back I don't want it I am not that kind I'll keep the money though I need it Shiva has come Take your things and go - Quick - Wait Will you go home disheveled like this? Wait a minute I have a shirt in my bag I actually bought it for my friend I don't know if it will fit you But take it Please Though you seem a tough nut to crack... ...you are soft as marshmallow inside Do you take good care of your wife? Do you beat her? Of course not! Do you scold her? Sometimes Don't scold her from now on, okay? What is your name? Which of my names should I tell you? I have a different name every day You can call me 'bangaram' Am I not 'precious'? 'Anna', has that woman gone? She left long ago Where did you go after opening the door? Door...? I didn't open the door, 'anna'! Who opened it then? I committed a big blunder I was so stressed out at the police station I called your mobile and explained my situation I forget you didn't have the mobile I blabbered like an idiot Who- Who did you talk to? I don't know How could you do this? Don't cry 'anna' Forgive me I know someone who will help us Let's go to him He will tell us what to do He will give us an idea Trust me on this Let's go Hello, sir Here is your bag, sir Do you accept I am a good chap at least now? - Did you send Ravana to Lanka?! - I am stuck with a problem, sir Now what? 'Anna' is here, sir Not here, sir He's waiting down there Look at that floral shirt of his! Does he watch too many Telugu films? What kind of jazzy shirt is that? Now what is the problem? Someone from his house opened the shop before I did So…? He is in dilemma where to go Could you give us an idea of a way out? What do you take me for? I can't write a script every hour One must script his life of his own accord He must go home sometime or the other He should consider himself blessed his respect is still intact Ask him to just shut up and face the music If he cannot face such hurdles... ...he can't progress in life Go advise him Dad? If you don't come back home for 2 whole days... ...won't your family be worried? Please try and curb your temper, son-in-law Did you bring us new clothes, dad? I have given it to the tailor You will get it tomorrow Who plaited your hair? Mom did What have you done to yourself? Go, play inside Hot water is ready Shower and I'll serve dinner (phone ringing) Dad, that call is for me 'Tell me' 'That was a huge favor I owe you one, big time' The guy who opened the shutter He's my friend He was the one who called now Don't worry, dad I haven't told anyone at home I sent the key through my friend I can trust him Friendship is all about trust, isn't it? Your friends are not dependable Go and freshen up Bhanu Let us not get our daughter married right now Let her study 'Praise be to my Lord Anjaneya!' Jai Anjaneya! Jai- - What, uncle? - Hey! Shiva I didn't get the hooker you were looking for I have a chic chick Shall I send her? Hang up! 'But you were the one who asked' - Hang up - What's wrong with you?
