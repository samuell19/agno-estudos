Hey, what’s up? Not much. Is there a brother of those you could give me? Can I come closer? - You can. It’s so fucking cold today. It is. Can I come closer? - You can. I’m not pushing it too far, am I? No, you’re not crazy. I ain’t. You come here often? I see you here all the time. And so, what’s up? - Nothing. Just shooting the shit. You come here often? Almost everyday. I live over there. I mean, I hide over there. - Over there? Yeah. And then you just hang around. You doing the runs? I don’t like talking much. When I talk no one puts faith, they already shot at me with a 22. I come here often because... I see things here. Things that no one else believes in, but I see them. I see them too. - What do you mean? They go over there and make noise. I see it all. - For real? I also thought I was going crazy. And then you keep coming here? I come here always when I want to hide from the radar. What do you mean? - I was arrested. I killed a guy. I had drunk them all. It was New year’s eve. I woke up hungover like a horse. I went to the market. I had a soup. As I was coming back, I ran into some friends of mine. They took me to the bar to play snooker. I was playing snooker with my friend. When a guy came and grabbed my ass. I wasn’t thinking, I hit him in the face with the cue stick. It struck him here on the front vein. He started bleeding, fell down and died. Did you know Corina? No. She killed a politician, one of those big ones, a guy up high. He owned cattle and factories, he had many industries in Golás. Inmates talk... The other women used to talk about her when I was in jail. They said she used to be a prostitute. That she went out with that guy and he wouldn’t pay her. And so she killed him over there, do you know that chop shop between sector O and Ceilândia? She killed him right there. She cut his head off, opened him up inside, put his head right in, sowed him up, and then she set him on fire. Then she walked away as if it was nothing with her. But then there are always the snitches, always those who can’t shut up. You know what I’m talking about, right? They called the police, they gave her description. And she was arrested right in the center of Ceilândia. She took a stint of 22 years in jail. She died inside. Before she died, she gave me a set of coordinates. As soon as I got out, I went straight to those coordinates. There I found a diary and some of her documents. Do you still have them? I was told to give them to the drifter. She told me about him. That a drifter would come, an intergalactic warrior, from her planet. But her planet’s name, I can’t remember right now… I only know his name, W.A. Do you know about him? Good morning. Your excellency, President of the Federal Supreme Court, Ricardo Lewandowski, Your excellency, President of the Federal Senate, Renan Calheiros. Your excellencies, the Senators, and Citizens of my beloved Brazil. On the 1st January 2015, I was sworn in for my second term as President of the Federal Republic of Brazil. I was elected by winning more than 54 million of the popular vote. On my inauguration speech... W.A.4, can anyone hear me? Ship remainders, everything burning, a lot of smoke, can anyone hear me? Are you sure it was here? I came here earlier, it could be here. The fog is getting stronger, there is a lot of smoke, can anyone hear me? We are on the coordinates, can anyone hear me? It is not the National Congress. I repeat. It is not the National Congress. In the past, in Latin America and in Brazil, every single time that interests pertaining to the economic and political elites was threatened by the popular vote, and there was no juridical reason or a legitimate impeachment, those elites conspired to perpetrate political coups. The President Getúlio Vargas was subject to a relentless persecution, the hideous plot orchestrated by the so-called Republic of the Galeão, which led him to suicide. The President Juscelino Kubitscheck, who built this city, was victim to continuous and failed attempts towards his overthrowing. President João Goulart, a defender of democracy, of the worker’s rights, and of social reform, overcame a parliamentary coup only to later be deposed. His deposition marked the beginning of the military dictatorship in 1964. For 20 years, we lived under the law of silence and democracy was swept away from our country. Today, once again, as the interests of the economic and political elites were contradicted and fought against by the popular vote, we face once again the risk of a democratic rupture. The constitution is invoke to serve the needs of a world of appearances which cynically overshadows the world of facts. The evidence presented makes it clear and beyond doubt that the charges against me are nothing but pretexts, disguised under a thin juridical rhetoric. Who are those over there? The rushers. Cool. It looks like a rebellion started over there, look. I am Wellington Abreu. I come from a planet called Karpenstahl, which in your language means the rising sun. There I invaded someone else’s land, with the aim of building a house for my mother, my wife and my daughter. I was arrested. I haven’t seen my daughter ever since. Then, all of a sudden, an order came. If I took the mission, my mother, my daughter and my wife would be given a house to live in. It was a social project they had, to give houses to everyone. I had never heard of anything like that, but I accepted right away. They threw me inside a ship and launched me into space. My mission was to get to Earth, Brazil, Brasillia, and to kill the President of the Republic, Juscelino Kubitcheck. Wellington Abreu, planet Sol Nascente, constellation 27, can anyone hear me? Under the roar of celebration of 21 artillery fires and the chords of the national anthem, the President of the Republic has hoisted the Brazilian flag in the Three Powers Square. That flag that will watch over the skies of Brasilia symbolizes a country that today became greater. My thoughts are now with the new generations, who will reap the fruits of our hard labor, who will stand on a new Brazil, a Brazil fulfilling of its true destiny. Today’s date doubly marks the history of Brazil. The glorious invocation of our past is now joined by the odyssey of the construction of this new capital, which we inaugurate today. We thus salute in one gesture the past and the future of our homeland, through two events that are united by their resilience towards a shared goal: the desire to make Brazil affirm itself as an independent nation. My vote is for the end of the criminal faction of Lula and the Workers’ Party, yes, for the end of the lazy Workers’ Union (CUT), yes, against CUT and its marginal, I celebrate Lava Jato, the Republic of Curitiba and my flag will never be red! Yes, President! PSB Paraná votes Yes.

PMBD Paraná votes Yes. Total: 66 votes. João Arruda from PMDB. Esteemed President, this is a juridical and political process. The will of the people of Paraná has weighed in, as much as the will of my party.

On behalf of the Brazilian people, on behalf of my love for this country, on behalf of the people of Paraná, of Curitiba, Londrina, Cambé, Rolândia, Arapongas and Ibiporã, who from my electoral basis, and knowing that this government does not have a parliamentary majority, and in any parliament of the world when the government does not have a majority, it does not have the grounds to govern.

I am lost. I ran out of supplies. The right motor has stopped. The left motor is stopping. The battery has died. I also have no more cigarettes. Andreia Vieira, police check. Your ID. What is your ID number? - 2071318. Sign here. Is there a jail in your planet? Have you been arrested? What is your name? - Andreia. I come from space. Did you meet Corina there? No. She was my only contact in the ship. The judge always came for me. Always, always, he always came for me. I always took my children with me, so that he saw I had four children, and even like that he put me inside. That guy I killed, he grabbed my ass… He was the one who started things... And I got sent to jail. Everyone else that day got absolved. People who had done... Did you hear that? - I did. I think they know where we are. Do you know this place well? They always know where we are. Hat judge was after me. My lawyer even started a process against him. But all my requests were always overruled. Always overruled. In cases like mine, people do their time on the street. If he had given me 6 months less, I would have done my time at home. But he wouldn’t give me 6 months. He made me do my time inside. He said there was no way he could let me go, that there was too much evidence against me. And so he sent me in, as if I were a piece of nothing. Move away from the staircase. Come. Come, don’t go down the stairs. Come with me. Come play over here. They come get us, we go to your grandfather’s. Take that out, let me go take a look at Iago. Careful, baby. But, if we do it like that, don’t we have to leave very early, mom? Hugo isn’t doing anything. Ask him, love, come on. I am waiting for the guards to do the rounds and Âtila is busy doing the dishes. Everyone is busy. Hugo, give your brother some juice, see what he wants? I was saying, once I was playing soccer, and some other woman struck me. When I got home my foot was hanging down. My mo put it back in place. She told me she had warned me not to go play. Geez... - And I had already had you... Really? Yeah, I was already a mother and I still got a spanking from my own mother. I had you very young, son, I was only sixteen... It was hard. At that time, when I was out, and I already had the four of you, it was hard, but when they put me in isolation and I spent ten days there, that’s when I realized that everything I thought was bad could get worse. Marquim, are you ready brother? Marquim, that is the rule. Cocktail Molotov. Guindart 121. Envy kills. It corrodes your mind, and happiness doesn’t make you happy. It’s an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, it’s the lead we trade, it’s a bullet on the target, that is revenge, that is revenge, that is revenge, there is always a snitch, that is revenge, that is revenge, that is revenge. And his world ends with a hole. That is revenge, yes, there is no way to deny, you break neck, when I walk by, and happiness doesn’t make you happy, traitors in the corner, coward on call, who knows us is aware, we are peace soldiers, but don’t push it too far, never stay under, it is not for money that we kill, but 121 is the rule, you will get fucked in revenge, your end is premeditated, envy kills, you better believe me bro, who wants to have more than they have, has to do to deserve it, from Chrysler to Kawasaki. I’m a motherfucker socialite, fast on the tongue, 121 is blowing up, the snitch is looking out, waiting for me to go down, he only sees what I have, he doesn’t see what I do, my rush, my rap, my life, bro. I have already seen many tough guys crying and getting high, in click and clack, the smoke of a joint, crazy psycho with a hole on the back, 121 fast thief, the good bandit runs desperate up the favela. Again, he looks at what justice has done, it put us behind bars, profane coward, he put the child’s smile, in an American outdoor, even as is, the good bandit goes on as he can, at home, waiting, holding a gun or not, the good bandit is never searched, because no one is an animal, except for the guilty charged.

I am certain that when the war comes no one will turn yellow. We are a strong, united and organized people. The enemy is among us, and it plots in the dark. It sends messages and packages during the night. The enemy says “I shall give thou” but it doesn’t give us shit. We must capture them. What’s it looking like? Right on plan.

What do you mean, just like this, just like the hood? - Yeah. The lot over there reminded me of my own. I invaded a lot over there and I got arrested. They called me everything, delinquent, lunatic, gang leader... They sent me to... - Hey! Listen up. The three of us awake, we will get tired fast and they’ll snatch us up. I’m going to get some shut-eye. Do you feel me? Brother, it’s the rule... I’m going to doze off and the two of you stay awake. I’ll sleep for like half an hour. Hey, look out. Listen up. It’s coming closer... Is it him? - That’s him. I think it’s him, go after him. Get in on, Franklin. I think it’s him. - It’s him. Go W, go, go, get it right, W. There you go... It’s him. Move closer, go, go, go closer, W. Closer, motherfucker. C’mon Franklin, let’s knock him out. Go, go, go! Everyone, watch out. We should have got him here, man, here we would have surrounded him. Right here... But the guy is gone... Go in there. He’s gone, he’s gone. Did you see where he went? Did he go up or down? Take a turn, take a turn. Fuck we lost him again. Take a turn, take a turn. Take it easy, careful. Go, go, go. Where should I stop? - You can go. Go, go, go. Stop. Fuck, we lost him... - Watch out, get ready, we’ll find him. See if he went that way. Get ready, get ready. I think he’s hiding around here. Look over there. Fuck, but let me tell you, you are slow, motherfuckers... We were so close to him. Franklin, why the fuck didn’t you pull the gun on him? I couldn’t get a clear shot. Fuck, you are some slow motherfuckers. We spent three days waiting for this guy… And when he comes you both go for him like some lazy motherfuckers... And so, who’s going out to charge the car? Fill the tires, bro, 30/30, go. 32 is better, no? 30, man, 30. Isn’t 30 too low? The car is heavy. Yeah, fill in with 32, engineer. Hey man... Put 32 on the back and... - 32 on the back, engineer. One of you has a lighter? The tires are empty, the ship is all to the side. It’s floating. It’s to the side. Attention, we now initiate the broadcast of National Television Network or the official pronouncement of the President of the Republic, Michel Temer. Good evening everyone. I undertake the presidency of Brazil after a democratic and transparent decision by the National Congress. This is a moment of hope, a moment to regain confidence in Brazil. The uncertainty is over. This is a time to unite the country. It is a time to place the country’s interests over the interests of certain groups of people. That is our flag. I am aware of the magnitude and weight of the responsibility I carry on my shoulders. My commitment is towards re-establishing the strength of our economy and to put Brazil back on track. This belief sustains the foundations of our government. And... Many months ago, ten, twelve months, when I was still Vice-President, we released a document titled “A Bridge Towards the Future.” At the time we were aware that it was impossible for the government to keep itself on the track it had set for itself. And we even suggested to the previous government to adopt the theses that we outlined in that document titled “A Bridge Towards the Future.” Since that did not work, and the measures were not adopted, process was initiated which culminated now with my formal inauguration as President of the Republic. Brazil has just finished traversing a long and complex process ruled and conducted by the National Congress and by the Brazilian Supreme Court. That process has culminated in the impeachment of Madam President Dilma. Everything was conducted, I must say, with the utmost respect for the Constitution. We have given an example to the world, shown that there is no democracy without the rule of law, and without applying the rule of law to everyone, including the most powerful. That is what Brazil shows to the world. And it does so through a process of depuration of its political system. We have an independent judicial system, a Public Prosecutor’s Office that is vigilant, and executive and legislative courts that fulfill their duties. The strength of institutions prevails against personal interests, under the attentive look of a plural society and an entirely free press. Our task now is to reinstate economic growth and to give back to Brazilian workers the millions of jobs they lost. We are certain of the path we need to follow. It is the path of fiscal responsibility. It is the path of fiscal responsibility. Trust is being re-established, and the sun is rising again on the horizon.
