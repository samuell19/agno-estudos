This Merry Planet I am Iks. I am Iks. Attention. We're approaching an unknown object. Igrek, are you ready? Well yes, I am Igrek. Yet another peripheral galaxy. So what? I've seen too many of these unknown celestial objects. And on this ball the nature is not even yet destroyed. No civilization there. There might be no sentient beings like us. But for some reason this celestial object exists. Zet? Are you ready? I am Zet. I am. I'm always ready. Some seven thousand light years has passed. Prior to landing, consume food for a month onwards! But we had a lunch just 2 weeks ago. Another month's intake will do no harm. Won't make it worse. That was our lunch. Now, remember - don't ever leave me on the on the masquerade. Why is that? Because it's always the same story with those masks. A person goes to dance with Beautiful Vasilisa, then it turns out she is a witch. I see. I refuse to have fun under surveillance, I'll stay home, and I will observe it from afar. Right in this telescope. Don't look there, look at the stars. I can see a star falling, you can make a wish. I wish that you come with me immediately. It's impossible. Nonsense. Did it really come true? Now I know how it happens. It's this historical moment. I am waiting. Come down, I'll cover. Comrades aliens! Told you. No civilisation here. Right. I suggest we begin analysing this curious powder. I remind you. The riskiest experiments are undertaken on the least valuable members of crew. I've seen worse in the Universe. Look! It is juicing. Perhaps it is because you held it too tight. Look, a sentient being! Should I whack it to be sure? It's better not to. There might be a lot of them here. Take note, colleagues, how sentiently it looks at us. Such a large head. It is certainly very smart. Hello! An unknown friend, We have come in peace to your planet. It understood us. It has departed to report. No. No, no, no. It shows us the way. Follow me! No, follow him! Did you get it? Don't rush it, they won't begin without me. Your town is not big, not a center of world culture. But they will wait for me. We'll cheer these people up. The masquerade costume was so hard to do. Why is that? At first I decided to dress as an electron. - Who? - An electron! Then I realised that electron is a negatively charged unit. - Not fit for a celebration, right? - I guess so. Then I decided to put on a synchrophasotron dress. But it's bulky, will be hard to dance. And then I had a genius idea. Perpetuum Mobile! Excuse me, what did you just say? A perpetual motion machine. A super costume! Do you think they'll understand? Don't you worry. Our people, they use the probability theory for fishing. You're kidding. I am! Congratulations, colleagues. We observe such diverse fauna for the first time. It might be our last time if things keep going this way. I do not understand what these monsters want from us. Maybe whack them to be sure? No! Colleagues, I think this was a reckless act. They followed us on purpose. It's a pity you didn't let me whack them. I feel we were lucky. It's like we were born under a lucky star. Please get yourself acquainted, this is our carnival staff: a doctor of physical and mathematical sciences. Please, no titles today. Simply Pinocchio. A wooden little man Pinocchio. Nice to meet you. Lepidoptera Pyralidae. Is she a foreigner? No, this is the name of my costume. I'm a moth. Are they all, too, PhD's and academicians? No, we have different people here. A seaman, a carpenter, an academician, and a hero too. Now tell me frankly, why did you need me here? You are the... what's the word... the instigator! An extinct mammoth. Are you saying you need a perosn of my speciality to be completely happy? - Sure! - No, you just need someone to mock. Is there really nobody else to laugh at? What have they gathered for there? Maybe they are deciding what to do with us? That's when we'll whack them all at once! No, no, no. It's not reasonable. I think we should be the first to contact them. Surely I can go on that mission. But maybe you do mind? No, I don't. Me neither. Well, thanks for trusting me. I am Iks, I am Iks. I see something in quantity of... one, two, three... three living beings. Your ticket, please. Listen, do you have a ticket? A ticket. Waves his hands pretending he doesn't understand anything. It won't do, you need a ticket. What are you, be polite! What if he's from another planet indeed. I am Iks. Looks like they want something. Trying to figure out what exactly. Don't talk to him like he fell from the moon. He was doing the costume all night. Are we going to deprive him of the party for lacking some piece of paper? He seems to understand, though he's mute. Okay, come in. ♪ Speaks in ancient Russian ♪ All you Ph.D's and candidates, please welcome a guest from other worlds. It's not by the bus he has arrived, but on a saucer, a flying one. Greet him as expected. Come in. Be our guest. Why are you so unwelcome. This comrade is from another planet. Music! Look, they greet him as if he's actual alien. He's an actual alien indeed. Surely my costume is the most appropriate one for the masquerade. Don't worry. The pirate's costume suits you very well. Especially when I remember how you oppose at the defence of a thesis. Comrades aliens, how are you doing, feeling well? Hey, come out. He went alone. To the city. Wait a second, comrade alien. Wait a second, comrade alien. Wait a second. What a cutie. Ladies and Gentlemen. I've been asked to learn by heart a New Year's song with you. Please learn the first verse. Here is how the melody sounds. The fir tree awaits it's friends today and dresses up and the New Year is silently coming closer. We want to get away from everyday worries today And the New Year is famous for miracles. The frost crackles, the snowstorm sweeps, the white blizzard whirls, and the New Year makes people younger. Well done! Bravo! Well done! Do you understand me? No, I don't. What's the matter? I am sure we understand each other. You have just shown me your language. Did I? I don't think so. I assume you're the leader here? In a way, yes. My pleasure. As representatives of two civilisations let's draw up an action plan. What can you, as a sentient being, offer me, as to a sentient being? Prokhor! Proschenka! What happened? Why the mess? Granny, how you like my suit? Simple and ingenious, first-ever perpetual motion machine! Check it! Children are surely the flowers of life, but which flower are you? Guess! Looks like it's time to come to rescue. Easy, the control time is not up yet. Attention, please. Ancient folk game. Get into the bag. Who'll be the first? Who's brave? Come on! From time to time it is necessary to conduct wild experiments. They rarely succeed, but when they do, they're amazing. - It's stupid. - We forgot how to do stupid things. Give us our containers. Ready! Such grandeur! So much enthusiasm. So much of creative energy. Such a work of thought. Such a blast. You won't find this in the entire Universe. But I think you din't quite find the best solution. I calculated that running without the bags is more rational. Here, look, of course it is primitive, but... I see. I've got another amusement for you. Would you like to take part? My pleasure. The control time is up, Iks didn't get in touch. Well, he was an useful member of the crew. I hope he didn't suffer much. Who's next? I suppose, we're solving a very important task. The task is to have fun. You didn't have to do that. We just began to have fun. What? Nothing happened to me. Why are you squeaking like an ungreased mechanism? Speak like a human. Speak like a human. Bravo. It served me for 16 years, and here they are. Some scuba divers. He's quite handsome. Aren't you looking for him? No. But I guess I'll try to cheer him up. And now, my friends, your favourite, the king of dancehalls, the white dance. Ladies invite gentlemen. The music is heard again, The piano player has risen and called the dance by name And for everybody to see I'm coming to you through the hall. I want to invite you to dance and only you. And, no coincidence, it's a waltz. And the white dance will make us whirl If the white dance will bring us together. And here I was, standing quietly, not touching anyone. The waltz is floating Kind like a friend, white like a snow Maybe we'll remember this waltz forever Could you give me a hint - what's this all about? I guess it's a waltz. - So, you can choose who you like, right? - What about you? Do you have a comittee? No, why, we use a computing machine. You put in a card and it picks an ideal match. A small error and your computer will give you a calculation for the rest of your life. Think it is a sure thing without a machine? Well, I can't guarantee that. Don't look sideways so much, I feel something moves inside of me. What's with you, colleague? You don't look healthy. I'm all right. I'm just feeling slightly out of place. Of course, we left our place in the woods. No, I have a pain here. Could be an infection, you should take measures. I guess these things are incurable but I'm glad the experiment is on me. I'm ready to die for our common cause. Brace yourself. Describe the symptoms! In short... On a noisy ball, by accident, I saw you, covered by the mystery. Consider me a new admirer of your talent. What's next? Talents are unpredictable, you know. Especially on the New Year's eve. Oh well, Igrek was an useful crew member too. The payback is due. Stop jumping, Iks and Igrek, or I will whack one of you. I'm sorry. Happy New Year. Have you seen a creature here? How did he look? - Strange. - There were a lot of strange ones here. Is that the one you're looking for? Oh, I'd recognise him from a thousand. Hello comrade alien! - Salute! Okay, you speak our language. - It's telepathy. - Sure it is! I knew we'll understand each other. You look so much like a human. - Hell yes I do. - Welcome! Thanks! Allow me to introduce you to the Earth inhabitants. It will be so sensational. Sensational? Sure! So cool! It's a pity. I almost destroyed it all here. And you already made friends with these monsters. You know, some of them are quite nice. They're strange though. Sometimes they make these sounds in choir: New Year, New Year. Sometimes they do these movements. Or take that rope for example. A big rope, they were pulling it and what happened? Nothing. Calm down! I see they've captured you. They are not going to get me. To avoid misunderstanding, hand me this. No! Hey guys, take it easy! Is that how you treat a lady? Did you call me a lady? What does it mean? I'll whack you for that! Gotcha! Please don't. Go, go away. Okay, okay. It's for you. As a sign of admiration and worship! What about my comrades? We share everything. It's of no use for them. Did no one ever gave you flowers? I'd love to know where such peasants live. The fir tree awaits its friends today and dresses up and the New Year is silently coming closer What's this? No big deal, just to remember. - Nice composition. - You think so? Load it! I've seen volcano eruption very closely, but I'm still afraid of champagne You've got nothing to be afraid of with me. But you're an artist! I am. It's just that Melpomene often plays a trick on us. She puts us on stage in the main role and makes us leave without a single line. With the new happiness! Listen to me. You finally came. You're the closest person for me. You should be the first to know. If anything happens to me, you'll be the first to learn too. Happy New Year! Do you know what happened? The frost crackles, the snowstorm sweeps, the white blizzard whirls And the New Year is making people younger. - Do you know what just happened? - Don't bother me. And we check our clocks, ready to meet it. And the New Year is bringing us the new happiness. - Do you know what just happened? - Let me have a drink at last! According to precise scientific data The wonders used to live in old tales But seems like they grew tired of that And now they have different addresses Now they have earthly addresses - Happy New Year. - With the new happiness. We dream of lunar landscapes, the life on poles goes steady, The buildings grow with every hour And perhaps not once everyone would See that they are at least for a bit involved with wonders To be at least for a bit is involved with wonders And take our word for granted The noble century prepares wonders again And those who hurry to answer that there are no wonders in this world, let them think it's just a miracle. Happy New Year! With the new happiness! Thank you! Happy New Year! Now you will really see that New Year's miracles exist. - So where's your miracle? - Wait a second. Comrades, please don't leave. Don't worry, nobody is leaving till the morning! - Happy New Year! - With the new happiness! Congratulations, friends. What are we celebrating? The New Year, of course. Is it such a rare phenomenon that it's worth celebrating? And why are you so keen on these vessels? We're having fun, aren't we? Can't you do without them? You're weird. Be healthy. So they do it for medical purposes? This is the first reasonable explanation I've heard here. Okay, let's take a sample. No, no, only me. The riskiest experiments on the least valuable members of the crew. How's your health, did it improve? No, nothing. But I have an idea. - Do you? - Yes. What if we celebrate not only the New Year, but also the new month, the new week, and the new day? Nobody before has thought of it yet. You're a genius! In the name of science! - Thanks. - No, no, it's dangerous too. Only me, for science. As the least valuable one. What have you done. You'll be hungry. To some there are roses, to some there are thorns. Tell me, do you have the words for every occasion? Well, not always. If only I could explain myself in the language of genre which I've given the best years of my youth to. In our electronic age, simply lovers don't cut it anymore I'm a soviet lyricist and in that regard I might be looking funny But physicist and lyricist can live happily together and in love Alas, to some fun is a duty, some just don't need it. I'm ready to believe you but could it be just a new attraction? I've imagined we're flying for many years, and I could see you just like I do now I won't let you be bored, I'll drive away your sorrows, Believe me, you alone, contain the whole world to me. A beautiful day, the shadows are getting longer, a bird on a tree dreams of singing. We'll imagine we're flying for many years, and I could see you just like I do now Bravo! Bravo! Encore! Comrade alien! Where are you? Don't hurt your loved ones blaming them, Be afraid to look cruel to them. Our loved ones are very vulnerable. For the high love we are obliged To remember that our loved ones Are connected to us with an invisible thread I'm sorry. Maybe our life goes not too smooth, But the most important thing in it are Those forever in our hearts, Our loved ones. I am Zet, I'm ready to everything. Anyone can sing today. But only few can cherish the love. One more word and I'll whack you. She could. - Who's there? - A friend. What do you want? We're having a personal affair. What is that so personal are you doing here? - Kissing. - I can see that, but what for? That's because we like each other. Wait, wait. I see. - Well, finally. - What? I've finally found you. Were you looking for me? I've been looking for you on all these planets. I've looked and couldn't find you. I've seen creatures with three legs, with six eyes, green ones with golden hair and the golden ones with green hair. But nowhere I've wanted to say to myself - stop, now is the time. What now? What do you mean? I mean I thought it all over and I agree. Agree on what? Wasn't it me you invited to dance? - It wasn't an accident, right? You like me. - I do. Now I don't get it. I just wanted to say I like you. Have an apple, don't be shy. There you are, let's go and I'll introduce you to ours. It's going to be sensational. It's nothing sensational! I don't exist for some at all. It's because they don't know you're an alien from space. Let's go, I'll open their eyes. Excuse me for a minute. A surprise! - What did he do to my hand? - We could amputate it to be sure. I'm Zet, I'm Zet, I'm always ready to everything. Don't you think you've been captured too? - Go on, go on! - Not like this, no! Here's how! I'm always missing something. Please, go with me. You can't imagine what's going to happen. No, I can. - Listen, do you have pliers? - What? Dear friends, we came to you from one of the most advanced planets. We won't make a list of what was there. But sometimes you want something like this, you know? On the most advanced planet everything is sensible, reasonable, intelligent. There is a lot of things but sometimes you want something like this. They pay no attention to feelings, considering them a waste of time. Farewells, dates, sufferings. But, to be honest, sometimes you want something like this. Something earthly. On the most advanced planet everything is sensible, reasonable, intelligent. There is a lot of things but sometimes you want something like this. They pay no attention to songs, saving their breath from shaking the air But, to be honest, sometimes you want something like this.. Something earthly. On the most advanced planet everything is sensible, reasonable, intelligent. There is a lot of things but sometimes you want something like this. They pay no attention to dances, saving their energy. No spare efforts, jumps and squats. But, to be honest, sometimes you want something like this.. Something earthly So nice. No, really. It's so nice. Did you like it? Zet, we couldn't hold ourselves. It's so nice, Iks. It's so nice, Igrek. It's so nice here. It's nice that among other planets there is this one. It's nice that here are so many happy bright faces Everyone should once meet their happiness And the sunniest day will come Everyone somewhere should once meet their happiness And stronger than ever, trust your hope. Your heart should believe. The heart is given for a reasom, the heart should believe. And stronger than ever, trust your hope. And the sunniest day will come. Everyone somewhere should once meet their happiness The heart is given for a reasom, the heart should love. It's so nice that among ordinary eyes there are eyes of loved ones It's so nice that happines won't pass unnoticed here Everyone somewhere should once meet their happiness And you won't find a happier one in the world Everyone somewhere should once meet their happiness And stronger than ever, trust your hope. Your heart should believe. Here's what I was talking about. What do you think? What's there to think? Happy new year! Comrades, I havre a very importand thing to tell you. Everyone should know. If everyone should know, say it from the stage. The heart is given for a reasom, the heart should believe. Looks like while we were flying, we did not notice a woman among us. Dear beautiful stranger, I've been chosen to tell you that according to the polls with the absolute majority of male voters and the majoruty of female votes with a few abstained you've been appointed the queen of the ball. Let's congratulate her, comrades. Let me crown you. Why are you crying? I don't know. I felt I was ready to everything and now I feel strange and good. Good and strange. And I don't want to whack anyone. Comrades, remember this moment to tell your grandsons about it. An hour ago, using this telescope, I saw a landing of a spacecraft from another planet. Why are you laughing? It is in the woods some 3 or 4 km from here. It's small but important crew is here among us. Let me introduce you a messenger from another planet of Alpha Centauri. Excuse me. It's summer heat again, It followed the blizzard, And the sun is shinning white again, But I'm afraid the Earth will go off it's orbit. The speed of things is overwhelming, The life drags me around the world, The dreams come to me while I'm on the road, But I'm always missing something, A summer in the winter, a spring in the autumn. The wind drags clouds over me The twenieth century has come. The horses have risen over the Bolshoy theatre Pass over the speed to them, human. The French Academy shouldn't have stopped accepting projects of perpetual motion machines. - It's extremely simple. - I agree. I see and feel the joy in life. I'm in love with perpetual motion. I've got enough of love and friendship. I also have a good song. The life drags me around the world, The dreams come to me while I'm on the road, Please allow me as a member of a real crew from the Alpha Centauri to thank this witty young man for a good joke. It turned out really funny, right? - And to give him our little souvenir. - Thank you. How dare you, comrades! It's not funny! He's actually from another planet! Think about it. Yes, look at you? You look like Martians at best. They did the costumes themselves. Or asked their wives. No such people on Alpha Centairi. There are! Don't believe him, he's an impostor. We're from up there. Wait a minute, friends. You cant quarry about such nonsense. - You didn't really come from afar. - No we did! It's a draw! Have fun! The party goes on! It's a catastrophe. No contact. Turns out, they didn't believe us from the beginning. How awful. You should think of something. I'm only a woman after all. A weak woman. I just want to show you our spaceship. I am really from another planet. Well, your manners are very earthly. I'm only susceptible. You won't come with me then? Should I ask someone else? Try it. Okay. What if I show you something you haven't ever seen? - What is it? - Our flying saucer. My dear, you can't surprise me with a flying saucer. Try the fabric, touch it. Thank you, thank you. But I've grown wings today for real. I'm flying! It's all futile. They do not believe us. There is only one solution. Now widen your circle. The newest offer! Kalinka Malinka! Don't worry. They don't know what they are doing. It's going to get better. It's getting better already. Hey, you have a drink? We have a business offer. Let's fly with us for a while. It's not fat from here. And we'll have a contact, agreed? Fly for a while? No, my friends, not good for my liver. A mouthful of champagne is my limit now. You fly without me. It's a sad thing you did not believe we came from another planet. One of you should fly with us to Alpha Centauri and see for yourself. Let it be the one who you worship the most. The most perfect, outstanding specimen. - Who, me? - Yes! Thank you for your trust I'm genuinely touched. - Where should I go? - This way. - With the instrument? - Yes. Thank you. It's thanks to you I felt myself a woman for the first time. Hey girl! Can I have your number? Admit it, are they from your department? Unfortunately no. But they did it so imaginative, so artistical. They'd become great scientists. See you. See you later on Alpha Centauri! I think there's a bit of truth in every joke. Don't worry, they have something intriguing in mind. Let's go. It's time to hit the road. We're leaving for a distant land Over our sweet home you'll see the shine of my silver wing. Let the fate thow us far away. Don't let anyone get close to your heart. I'll watch closely Know that I see everything form above Where are we going? I think the joke went too far, and so did we. Isn't it time to go back? It's impossible. - What are you doing? Let me go! Something happened. I feel it. What is this? Our saucer! Wait a second. I somehow got used to this planet. I don't want to fly away. I understand you. I feel he's no more. What are you waiting for? Let's go! No. Your trip is a decided thing. Welcome onboard! Good bye, my merry planet. I feel it, we'll meet again. Look! They flew away. Can you see these flowers? It's their turbines that burnt the earth. Do you believe me now? Maybe I do, Stargazer. How? What? Oh, you mean all this? Comrades, you're serious adults, don't tell me you believed all of this. According to precise scientific data The wonders used to live in old tales But seems like they grew tired of that And now they have different addresses Now they have earthly addresses And take our word for granted The noble century prepares wonders again And those who hurry to answer that there are no wonders in this world, let them think it's just a miracle.
