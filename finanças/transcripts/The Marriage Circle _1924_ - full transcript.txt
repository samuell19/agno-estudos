THE MARRIAGE CIRCLE A few days... and a few nights... in Vienna... ...still the city of laughter and light romance. The day starts late, but gloriously... ...in the home of Prof. Josef Stock. Dearest Mizzi. I've just learned that... ...you moved to Vienna two months ago and I feel hurt... ...that you didn't let me know. I'm so anxious to see you again and have you meet my husband... ...You and your husband must call soon... Affectionately. Charlotte. "Keep on with your cruelty... and some day I'll leave you!" "That's just what you want... ...but you'll not ger rid of me so easily." "I'm engaged and waiting for my passenger." "If you're in a hurry, let me take you part of the way." "Oh, sure... you look beautiful!" Charlotte, whose marriage to Dr. Franz Braun is ideal. Eduard Grieg "I LOVE THEE" ...love thee, dear, I love thee now and... "You'll get over it... in time!" "Mizzi, you can't imagine the perfect happiness of our married life!" ...I love thee more than any earthly creature... "Don't be silly... husbands are blind!" "Did you ever see a man like him!" "I LOVE THEE" "That's his favorite song." HELIOS VIENNESE INTERNATIONAL DETECTIVE AGENCY... ...I hereby employ the Helios Detective Agency... ...to collect evidence against my WIFE... ...and agree to pay the usual bonus for sufficient proof... ...of misconduct to procure a divorce. Prof. Stock. "Professor, I never fail... you're as good as divoced." "Mrs. Stock has a fainting spell, and wants Dr. Braun to come at once!" "I thought you were ill." "It's my heart again." "This is Dr. Braun... Charlotte's husband." "I had another attack of my heart trouble." "You must take good care of me." Dr. Gustav Mueller calls at the Braun's every morning... ...ostensibly for his partner, but really for a glimpse... ...of his partner's wife. "I've never seen you look so... so beautiful!" "I might come to your office some day... when you are not expecting me." My dear Mrs. Stock... I am convinced that... ...I am not the right physician to treat your case... ...so please consult another. With best wishes for... ...your speedy recovery, Sincerely, Franz Braun DR. FRANZ BRAUN DR. GUSTAV MULLER PSYCHICIST SPECIALISTS "Any one who talks so much can't be sick." "Lucky Devil... to be so loved by your own wife!" "I want to teach him not to throw my roses away." "It's a very serious case." "You see... how crazy my wife is about me?" "I... er... a nervous man knocked it over." "But I have many patients!" "Gustav, you're my best friend. Please... please console her." With the first quarrel forgotten, the Brauns give a dinner party. "We'll never quarrel again... never!" "You seem greatly interested in Miss Hofer." "Dr. Schmidt... friend of mine." "I'm sorry, but I have important business at the club... ...that will keep me there all night." "He changed the place cards so he could sit by Miss Hofer... ...but I put them back." "Miss Hofer, I'm so glad to see you." There is more danger in dancing than in dining. "Get him Mizzi... dance with him... talk to him... ...don't let him out of your sight!" "Your dress!" "I'm afraid you'll be cold!" "Mizzi!" "Where's Franz?" When a big party ends, small parties begin. Slip out if you can. I'll wait in the car... ...at the corner for ten minutes. Mizzi Stock. "Your behaviour with Pauline Hofer was simply... scandalous!" "If you won't believe me... if you can't trust me... ...then I can't stay here!" "Dear, even if I am cross something... ...I love you just the same." "I merely wanted to prove how frightfully careless... ...your husband is to leave you alone in the dead of the night" "How can a husband, who loves his wife, neglect her so!" "I love you... I just can't help it... nobody could!" "Wait... I'm going back with you." "Come upstairs... and phone for another taxi." "Don't worry... he'll come back." "You will not go back." "I cannot live without you!" "Prof. Stock has gone home." "Josef! I need love!" "...I promised to tell Prof. Stock... ...the result of the last chess game." 1:10am Dr. Braun and Mrs. Stock arrive in taxi and enter house. 1:15am A light is turned on in the room. 1:22am Shades are pulled down. Remarks: When I left the house after 1:50am Dr. Braun was still there. "Pack your things." Then the morning, when one can't look the sun in the face. "Get out and leave me in peace... or I'll tell my husband!" "I had a terrible dream... Gustav was kissing me!" "That's what happens... when you leave me alone." "That is true... but I give you my word... ...my visit was entirely innocent." "I believe you... but nobody else will... ...and I'm delighted to have a man of your standing... ...help me get rid of my wife." "By the way, Mizzi is at the Hotel Bristol... since this morning." "Franz! There's a man in this... but who?" "Hotel Bristol!" Franz: I suppose my husband has told you everything... ...Well, it's all your fault that I'm in this desperate situation... ...Why did you come to my house at all... ...if you merely wanted to tell me that you did not love me? ...If you are not here by 10 o'clock... ...I shall call at your office. Mizzi "Confide in me... who is this man?" "My husband... and my best friend!" "I'm innocent... I've done nothing... Here is the proof!" Franz: I suppose my husband has told you everything... ...Well, it's all your fault that I'm in this desperate situation... ...Why did you come to my house at all... ...if you merely wanted to tell me that you did not love me? ...If you are not here by 10 o'clock... ...I shall call at your office. Mizzi "Is it my fault that your husband fell in love with me?" "I'll mail you a copy." The dreaded end of a dreadful day. "You must talk to Charlotte... you are the only one... ...in whom she has perfect confidence." "Wait, Franz, my boy... I'll teach you a lesson... ...so you'll never look at another woman." "We had better go in the back way." "Don't ask my forgiveness... I'm as guilty as you." "Gustav's kiss was no dream... it was real... ...in this room... in that very chair!" "Tell me... didn't you return to this room last night?" "And didn't we kiss each other?" "Fifty-fifty." THE END
