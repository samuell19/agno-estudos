Glory to the Suttee! Hail Suttee Hail! She's got courage! Hasn't made a sound It's the opium. She's drugged. Gangacharafls niece had a lucky escape! She was about to marry our corpse!

And that's only because Major Sleeman wasn't around.. ...when they went for permission They say that British will ban it soon Don't speak like atheist! When has law ever ruled Religion? If a pious woman wants to become a Suttee" ...there is no force that can stop her! Chant with me Hail Suttee Hail! O ye faithful widows! Ascend without tears the pyre For she who joins her lord in death Earns the same right to heaven As the Holiest of elibates And earns the same number of years in Heaven As there are hairs upon the human body And like a snake charmer Draws her lord out from the pits of Hell!

When Laxmi died, she left her daughter in my care... "She has no one in the world" Laxmi had said" "look after her" Look after her! You mean just talk! Your sister died leaving a 3 month's baby It was I who fed and clothed her... "and cleaned up her mess! But can I help it if she's mute? It's a waste of money paying her dowry! And every year, the groom will keep coming for his dues Do you think any family will take her home? Any time of day she's playing by the river! Or roaming about stealing fruits! Tell me, does a housewife behave like that? Or do you think Umi can be tamed into one? No, this is a blessing in disguise This way at least she will be free. As she has always been That is true And it's no trouble Doesn't Umi spend hours by a tree near the river? That could be the groom What do you say, Father? Shall we consult Bachaspati?

Don't start again! link that half witted child... Can you tell the difference? Anarchy Anarchy is everywhere! In Calcutta that atheist Ram Mohan... "is ruining our society with his new fangled ideas! They say the British will abolish Suttee soon? It's all Ram “Johan's work! And who will protect the widows after that? Ram Mohan, I suppose? What is the definition of Suttee? Meaning "A wife who grieves in her husband's sorrow" "rejoices in his hour of joy... "is pale and sickly in his absence And joins him gladly at death Such a wife is a Suttee But... ...in the hands of foreigners this holy land... ...is being reduced whore house! A dark future for Hindus! I predict a dark, gloomy future! A moment has arrived for all Hindus to arise... ...and save our religion from ruin! Holy Scriptures say... ...that keeping a daughter unmarried after puberty" ...is a grevious sin! You are sinning gravely Gangacharan! Her horoscope clearly indicates widowhood.. Hmm! .. Mars is in the eighth... In such a case. Marriage to a tree is called for Do not hesitate, Gangacharan This is just a ritual If widowhood is indicated... ...marriage with a tree will nullify that She may then remarry if a groom can be found No harm in that Exactly what Pandit Haridhan said to our schoolmaster here. Go and inform Gangacharan... Not to ruin his own daughter's marriage prospects Marry her to a tree for the time being If she is lucky she may get a man later Don't be so upset Gangacharan Marriage to a tree is an accepted social custom Trees like Banyan or Aswatha Are after all symbols of Lord Narayana! Therefore society cannot accuse you of neglecting... ...your orphan niece... The kurchi flower blossoms too soon Our daughter must leave for her husband's home Our hearts are heavy with weeping Her father weeps on his way to the market Her mother weeps on the way to the shore All he hears is the noise of our dear ones weeping For they shall see her no more Her father has a mansion The groom has a hut in the woods What did her father see in this groom? Alas, what did her father see? Your destiny is black, my child Your destiny is bad Your father has sealed your fate with your groom Your fate has been sealed with your groom Repeat after me...
