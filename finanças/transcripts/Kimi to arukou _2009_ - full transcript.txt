Starring Maki Meguro & Ryu Morioka Directed by Yuya Ishii Konaka Nishi High School 3 Hours Ago Shampoo, rinse, body soap. Got everything? Sure. What's that? Shaving gel. You shave? How pathetic! Don't be nasty, Teacher. Why wear your school uniform? It suits me. Makes me look cool. I can't afford expensive clothes. But a school uniform flatters my figure. That's why I'm wearing my uniform. Good grief. You're still a kid. I told you not to treat me like a child, didn't I? But you are. Why wear your uniform under these circumstances? That's so childish. Listen, if a cop spots your uniform, carrying bags, he'd pick you up right away. You think so? Maybe I shouldn't, but... ...I look my best in my uniform. But what's the point if it leads to you getting caught? Don't be foolish. Why bother to look your best, anyway? It's stupid. I'm sorry. Whatever. Check the list to see if we have everything. I wrote down everything we need to elope. It's a perfect list. I think I've covered everything. You have to keep studying in Tokyo. Study hard and become a lawyer. Promise me. If you become a lawyer, even if you're in trouble sometime later, you'll get by. Become a lawyer. Because of this study hard. I'll teach you. What's that? Speak to me in English. How do I do? I don't get it. I asked "How are you?" So you answer me, "Fine thanks, and you?" All foreigners do that. It's the basics of basic English. You've got a long way to go to become a lawyer. Look, I don't really want to go into Law... Study hard. Yes, I will. Let's meet in 3 hours. Run! Escape! Run! I said run! Run! This is our first hurdle. Yeah. We can't really be spotted together, can we? Exactly. You can't relax your guard for a moment. Everyone here knows you, so wear your mask. OK. Are you okay? Wear your mask, I said. Come on. Ms Tanaka, let me hold your hand. You mean it? Yes, I do. Okay, then. Listen... You really know how to treat women. Thank you. I'm impressed. Thanks. Right! Not catching a bus? We'll walk to the station. Seriously? To Walk Beside You Suicide Epidemic - 50,000 Victims - This is Shibuya? - Right. - It's scary. - Very scary. - Really? - A hotbed of crime. - Really?- So much evil here. - There is? - The evils of the whole world. - For real? - It's frightening. - It is. - But don't worry. - Why? - I came here when I was in grade school. - You did? - A couple ofttimes. - Really? Is that right? I need a river to heal me. I feel the same. - Let's go find a river. - But there aren't any around here. There's one in Suginami. - There is? - Yeah. What's Suginami? Suginami, I know it. This Shibuya really stinks. I need to be by a river. Where can we find one? So this is Tokyo river? It's filthy. It shows what man has done to nature. Man is terrible. All humans are fools. - I agree. - We're very foolish. Yes... What's that? Are you acting strange? No, I'm not. Give me your phone. We'll dump them. Really? Give it here. I'll dump it. Our new lives start now. I'll count it down. One, two. Isn't it illegal to dump into rivers? These masks, too. Ready? One, two. Isn't it illegal to dump masks into the river? - Where's that from? - I bought it earlier. To celebrate our elopement. - Congratulations. - Let's do it. Sure. Yes. Good. Come on. Real Estate Rentals Come in. - It's big. - Great, isn't it? The kitchen. It gets lots of sunshine. No word of a lie... Great view, isn't it? Views like this are rare in Tokyo. That's for sure... It's only 78,000 yen a month. But I can bring it lower for you. You're brother and sister? No, we aren't. There's all types of weirdos in Tokyo these days. I have to ask, just to be on the safe side. Sorry about that. I like it, Teacher. Teacher? So is this some kind of immoral relationship? No way! I get it. You're a student preparing for an exam. That's right. And she's your mother. Exactly. I'm not. - I'm not your Mom. - But, just now... I get it now. She's your sister. No, she's not. I am. Thanks, anyway. I'll get the rent down for you. There's something I want to do in Tokyo. What? Attend a gym that specializes in anti-aging. Really? I'm 34 years old. Too old for an English teacher, isn't it? No, I wouldn't think so. Over the hill... Not at all. I'm bad to the bone. No, you're not. I'll start attending gym and a beauty salon tomorrow. You keep up your studies. Then you can become a lawyer. All right. Can you massage me? Sure. Tell me if you need anything to help you study. I'll buy you anything. Do you really have so much money? Of course. I'm a mature woman. Are the cops looking for us? Doesn't matter. I'll get arrested. Are you serious? Could I just pull my baseball cap down low? Impossible. To be technical, this isn't an elopement. I'm more of a kidnapper. I'm an evil woman. Don't you think I'm a nasty, 34 year old? I really don't know. Good. Okay. - Burdock jelly? - Yeah. It gives the best sensations. Here. In it goes. It fits perfectly. How's that? - It stinks. - Really? Reeks. It's putrid. - Is it? - It's so bad. Smells rancid. Give me a sniff. That was on purpose, wasn't it? - It smells really foul. - Told you. That's why my brother always bathes after using it. - What? - Forget it. Let's go. It's all ready to go. Try it now, Taketomo. Get your pants off. C'mon, hurry up. Come on. Now stick it in. Well? How is it? Good? Awesome. They can probably trace phone calls. - Phone calls. - You reckon? That's bad. Just ask if anyone reported us to the police. All right. But isn't it dangerous to call? Hang up in 29.99 seconds. 29.99 seconds? I saw it in a movie. American cops can trace in 29.99 seconds. Oh, right. I saw that movie, too. Probably less than that. What? So, 20 seconds then? I don't know. Just a moment. Can they trace a phone in 20 seconds? Is technology really so advanced? Well, it's been gradual, but steady. Which are better, American or Japanese police? Americans. Because they're Americans. Yeah, right. So Japanese cops will take at least 40. Wait. So what do I do? This is scary. Okay, give it 25 seconds then. You can do it in 25 seconds, can't you? Hold on. Who will you call? - Taketomo. - Taketomo? Is he capable? Sure. - Taketomo, how is it? - Awesome. Feels good? Come on. It's great. Come on. Tell me. This rocks. I got a massive hard-on! Hello? It's me. Quickly, have they asked the police to search for me? Are they looking for me? Yeah, trying to find me. I don't have much time. Okay. Thanks, bye. - In time? - Just. - How did it go? - Right on the edge. - I'm not really sure. - That's okay. Look cops. Well? He called and I lost my stroke. You didn't shoot? Come on! - But... - C'mon, Taketomo! That call was weird. Who was it? Norio. Norio... damn it! So what did he want? He asked if the cops were searching for him. Lookin' for him? - Yeah, Norio. - Get your pants on, man. Stop fucking around! You didn't cum? I said no, okay? Are the cops lookin' for him? Of course! Really? Japan is a nation of laws, okay? Yeah, sure. I nearly shot my wad. Damn Norio. Who? Norio. That guy... One Year Ago Are we there yet? Almost there. He jerks off 5 times a day, not 3 times. - No, 6 times. - 6 times? - Six a day? - Way too much. - That's way too much. - You're a stud, anyway. Here? Your place? Yeah. Sorry. It's messy, isn't it? I had a real complex about it when I was a kid. Sure. Sorry about that. Right! Let's shoot our loads into this. No, don't play around. I'll pass today. Me, too. Not coming in? I've something to do... - Really? - Nothing important, though. - That thing. - Right? - Same for you, right? - Yeah. Me, too. Wait a minute. Is this because it's so untidy? No, it's not that. You're way off. - Yes it is. - No. - It is. - Nah, you're dead wrong. - Come on. - Well, see you at school tomorrow, okay? Hey, Taketomo. Wait up. - What's up? - You won't come in because it's a mess? - No, that's not it. Stop it! You're wrong! What a dump. It sure is. Isn't Japan an advanced country? Yes, it is. His place is the pits. I'm not shooting my wad in that filthy dump. Hey, Norio is still watching. Dirt poor, dirt-crazy. You said it. Miss Tanaka. You look so beautiful when you're eating. What's that? Come on, finish your dinner. Sure. Beautiful? Me? Silly boy. Yes, Miss. Welcome everyone. Hey you. Hey, old lady. You're too slow to learn, aren't you? - Right? - Wow, what a smell! You stink! You think you're better than us? - Man, you reek! - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. You don't take it seriously. - Do it properly. Get a move on. - Come on, dance to attract customers. Start dancing. - Like this? - Come on, dance. Do it properly or you'll scare them off. Dance! Where's it all come from? Good grief! You want a hand? Would you? - Sure. - Thanks. It stinks! I'm so sorry. It's not my dog. - I can't get used to it. - Man, it stinks! What school? I don't go to school. Your parents? I'm an orphan. My father died. I don't know where my mother is. How did your dad die? He killed himself. Serious? I'm like you. Take it. It's a present. Thank you. Will you play the night game tonight, Mr Abe? Mr Abe? Who's Abe? You're Abe from the lions, aren't you? A baseball player? Oh, the cap? You're not Abe? Yes, I am. You like Abe? - Yeah. - In that case, I'm Abe. An inside pitch that missed for ball four. He's got runners on 1st and 2nd base. Hiroki Abe, cleanup batter of the Lions, is up next. He's one of Japan's best sluggers. Now Abe is up at the batter's box. Go for it Abe! Come on Abe! Go for it Abe! Go, go Abe! Abe drank from this bottle. Fantastic. What's the weather like today? - Cloudy. - Yes. Practical Baseball No.1 Let's begin. Mr Harry Kitagawa, Japan's most famous Eurasian player. And you were a bridge master during your playing days. How many home runs... did you hit a year? Well... I leave it to your imagination. You know I went through various problems. - What would those be? - Don't ask such things. Let's start the lesson. Okay, let's begin. How many home runs did you hit a year? Well... I'll leave it to your imagination. Homerun King Harry Kitagawa's Baseball Tips On this first lesson, what do you plan to show us? The coolest way of spraying. - Spraying? - Yes. - The subject is, how-to-spray. - Is that right? Kids today probably don't know how to spray, I reckon. It could be dangerous. That's right. - Let me demonstrate. - Please. The coolest way to spray Thank you. The coolest way to grip a bat It's better not to teach too much at the start. That's right. Let's start with how to grip the bat. Certainly. What's this you're showing us? It's Kakefu-style. Of course, Kafeku-style. Why are you watching that? What about studying? I do study. I need some money. How much? About 20,000 yen. Is this for study? Yes. Sure, I have lots of money. How was it at the gym and the salon? Like Heaven. A present. Great, thanks. Sorry you didn't get a home run yesterday. - Didn't I? - No. It's not that easy, you know. Come on, let's play. Great, thank you. - Well? - It's so cool. See? This is real baseball. Yes. Who do you live with, Yasutaro? A man I don't know. Is he good to you? Sometimes. Do you miss your parents? Yes, I do. I'll teach you baseball instead. Right! Are you lonely, Mr Abe? Yes, of course I am. But you know... I live with a good woman now. And she cares for me very much. Wait, sir. Where's your mustache today? I shaved it off for today. Welcome. Any chance? Like I said, I can't give you more hours. - You're no good. - Please, I can't make ends meat. That's your problem not mine. I implore you. I need at least six 8 hour days. Impossible. You're crazy. Please, I can't pay my rent. That's your problem, not mine. Hey. 'Morning. Are you on your period? No, I'm not. Me neither. I didn't ask you. Welcome home. I'm back. Is this right? No, it's wrong. No, it should be "I'm... something..." I wrote it down earlier somewhere. Be serious! What's with the mustache? Be serious about it! I'm over 30, it provokes hysteria. Sorry. Not collecting today? What? Turds. If you want me to. Okay, let's do it. Come on. He won't do one. Really? It's not my dog. It's my ex-ex-boyfriend's. What ex-ex? Maybe my ex-ex-ex boyfriend. Ex-ex-ex boyfriend? How many have you been with? About 20, I guess. Really? So many? - Maybe even more. - Really? Are you serious? Just a minute. Oh, my... I'll get a turd, after all. What? Help me. What? Just a minute. Just a... I'm inside, come on in. It's illegal to use a disabled bathroom. But I'm kind of disabled. I get these erotic feelings all the time. Awesome. Come closer. Come on. - Well... - Go ahead. You're a virgin, aren't you? Well, yes. That's no good. - Come on. - No, I can't. - No, please. Don't. - Y'know you want to. I only came to get you a turd. - Forget that. Come on. - But you wanted one. - But I don't want to, so please stop. - Where's the harm? Stop. Don't do that. Please... No, I really don't want to! How old are you, Yasutaro? Nine years old. Nine, huh? I'm impressed that you study so hard. I want to be a lawyer. Huh? Ow, erm... Can I go take a dump? A dump? A dump. No, please. Don't. - I only came to get you a turd. - Forget that. - But you wanted one. - Come on. No, you can't! Go and practice. Sorry. No. You can't take a dump. Why do you want to be a lawyer? Before Mom went missing, she told me to become a lawyer. Okay. Every mom wants her child to be a lawyer or a doctor. They all do. Want ice cream? Yeah. Huh? Not wearing your glasses today, Mr Abe? Just for today. Hey, granny! You're not trying. Speak up! Hear me? Come on. Don't monkey around with me. Boss, please, no. - Stop it, please. - You want money? - Yes. - Then earn it. Got that? - No. Stop it, please. Let's go. Letter of Farewell That's Norio. Apparently he quit school. So what? His family was dirt poor. Both parents killed themselves. He shouldn't go to school. Right. It's all because of the Liberal Democratic Party. But what can you do? Nothing, right? The Liberal Democrats run the country. That's right. - Selected by the people. - That's right. Is he trying to kill himself? How can he? The river's too shallow, right? That's right. Still, I do feel sorry for him. We should at least wave. Don't you think? Okay, sure. Let's do it. What a mess. Come on! Good grief. This is the pits. Miss Tanaka! You are just so pitiful. Get on it. I'm only seventeen. I have no parents. I'll be put into foster care and forced to do hard labor. Oh, shut up. How dare you! Your reasons aren't convincing. I'll do it for you. You already did. If you decide to run, never look back. Never run and look back. That's so uncool. Then what? Just run! Run as far as you can. Run! Run! I won't go to the salon tomorrow. I'll tutor you instead. No beauty salon? Thing is... I'm studying with a kid I met at the library. Get some rest, Miss. Okay. I'm off now. See you. Are you really going to study? Yes, I study every day. Welcome, sir. How long do you want the room? Welcome, sir. Hey, get him! Yes, sir. Hold up! I get it. So you eloped with her? Good. It sounds somehow erotic. You reckon? You know I love her. But she doesn't look at me as a man. It's more that she sympathizes with my difficult situation. And anyway, what is love? I'd say that it's up to each person... I'm talking about love. I think that... I need water. Yeah, sure. Are you okay? I'm fine. You're sick? I'm not feeling well. I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant. You're pregnant? - Really? - Yeah. I want to run away, too. My parents want me to get an abortion. Where will you run to? I don't know, but I can't get it wrong. So, who's the father? My boyfriend, a classmate. - Really? - Yeah. - Tokyo's really something. - Yeah. It's awesome. Sure is. I know an elopement specialist you can talk to. - You mean it? - Yeah. - Are you okay? - Yes. I'm fine. That's good. Are you attending school? Yes, I am. Is that true? Yes. You haven't seen him, have you? No, I haven't. Don't think crazy things. Have the abortion. Graduate high school and go on to college. That's the best thing for your future. Understand? Mom. To tell the truth... I want to keep it. I will not allow it. Mom, I beg you. Never! You must have the abortion. Get rid of it! Turn it off. Come here. - Come here! - Yes sir. - You can't work for shit. - Sorry. You're here to work, right? Yes. I'm sorry. - What the hell are you doing? - Sorry. - Wanna quit? - No, I don't. - Wanna get fired? - No, sorry. - I need work. - Then do it! Sorry, I'm late. - Sorry about earlier. - Don't sweat it, work is work, after all. Thanks for today. Your pay, 8,000 yen. - Check it. - Yes sir. Thanks. You're under 18, aren't you? It's actually illegal to employ you. But that's our secret, okay? Sure. Thanks very much. Excuse me. Hey, you. Granny! Don't stand around. Hustle! Hey! Are you listening? Don't spray me. What did you say? Hey! You spat on me. Who do you think you are? You're doing it again. What? When you yell. - What? - You spit on me. - Huh? - When you get excited. You spit on people. The Lions' cleanup batter Abe is on first base. He hasn't made it home 72 times in a row. Go for it, Abe. Abe is grounded out on second base. His shoulders are slumped in disappointment. You're already asleep? Welcome home. I slept all day today. You didn't come home last night. That's right. Were you out studying? No, I wasn't. I started working late at the factory. I thought I'd get you a present. Do you want anything in particular? No, nothing. Why did you get a job? Where? A plastics processing plant. We need money to live, don't we? Didn't I tell you I have money? - But Miss... - Don't take liberties! All you need to do is study! I'm sorry. Sorry. No I'm not! I did nothing wrong. And stop lying to me. I know you work in a bar. How can I concentrate while you're there? I'm stupid, anyway. I thought we were in this together. I saw you working as a tout for that bar. Oh, that's why. I see. Now I get it. That's why you're having an affair with that schoolgirl from there. - You're cheating, right? - What? - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. I don't care if you're cheating on me. But defying me like this pisses me off. She's pregnant, right? - How did you know? - It's obvious. I've been pregnant, I know what it's like. - So you like pregnant woman? - You? Pregnant? Hang on... - Is she your type? - Stop it. - Oh, I know. It's your baby, isn't it? - No way. Just a minute. - What? - Like I said, she's... Now I know what you're on about. But she's not my girl. I understand now. That's how it is. That's how it is. Are you two really together? Yes, we are. Hey, there. And are you really going out with him? Yes, I am. What's good about him? He's very kind. I see. I don't understand kids today. But now you're pregnant. You should have used contraception. But it feels better without a condom. The best sex is without condoms. I had no objections. Listen, any fool know's it's better without a condom. But you use them to prevent pregnancy. That's being civilized. - I'm sorry. - Sorry. Can you take care of a child? Yes, we can. You're still young. We'll be fine. - What's that? - The sign of the cross. I'm Catholic. Catholic? Yes, I'm a Catholic. If you're a Catholic, use condoms. But Catholics aren't allowed to use condoms. He's right. That's true. - But some Catholics do. - They do, don't they. Alright, enough. Okay... Let me tell you... Listen. Without money, you'll have tough times. But if you seriously love each other, you should elope. Even if your parents oppose. Have your baby. It will be tough, though. You'll go through Hell. You should have the baby. What's wrong, Teacher? I have a child, too. I don't know where it is now. We were separated 4 years ago. What? I didn't tell you before. Sorry. I wanted to get the timing right. I didn't mean to hide it. I've been through a lot in my 34 years. I had my baby when I was very young, too. We broke up soon afterwards. So much suffering. My ex-husband took the child. I miss my baby. I want my baby. Since I lost my child, I've distanced myself from my own family. I ended up losing everything all at once. It's so hard! It's so hard to run away. You still want to? I do. I understand. Leave everything to me. I'm used to it. I've done it twice. Come again? Done what twice, Miss? Hang on. I don't follow. Must you be so petty? Well, yes. Sorry about that then. Wait a minute. So you had a child when you eloped the first time? Right. Do you really care about that? Now I love you the best. Be understanding. Do you love him as a mature man? Of course. Good for you, Norio. Way to go! Good on you! Before Mom went missing she told me to become a lawyer. Wait a minute. You wanted your child to become a lawyer? Of course. It's the best profession. How old would it be now? Nine years old. Nine. What are you doing? Cleaning. You're lying. I know you're lying. You're lying. Now tell me. You're lying! Yasutaro! It was only your dad who died, right? - And your Mom? - No idea. You have no idea. Your mom disappeared 4 years ago, right? You miss her, don't you? Right? I'll arrange for you to meet her. But I'll need your bat. I have 8,000 yen, so I'll give you 2,000. Count it. Make sure it's all there. Buy whatever you want. But promise me you won't tell your mom... that your father killed himself. OK? See you at 9 tonight in front of the library. Got that? Don't forget, OK? Bye. Okay, we're ready. Do I stand ready here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Will I kill her mom if she comes out? - What if she does? - Kill her. Just kill her. This is bad. Really bad. Oh, crap. Grab the bags. Hurry! Listen, this is how to run away properly, understand? Yes. By the time she finds out, you'll be aboard the ship. You're safe. Stay put for a month when you arrive. I told you she was a specialist at this. My daughter has run away. She's just left. She's absconded. Please come quickly. Bring her back as soon as possible! My address? Well, I live at... Please come quickly! I told you I was working. A farewell gift. - No thank you. - It's only 2,000 yen. 2,000 yen? Take it. - No, thanks. - Go on. - Really, no. - Take it. No, I can't. C'mon. Thanks. The boat is about to leave. OK. Some spending money. - No thank you. - Take it. It's only 50,000 yen, anyway. 50 grand? 50,000? Look, I'm sorry. I didn't know the going rate. Sorry about that. Take this, too. - No, really. - Go on. 6,000 will buy a bunch of stuff. Thanks. Wait a minute. Good luck. We can't search unless we know where to look. So calm down and talk us through it. Listen. She can't have gone too far. - Ah, I see. - She's only just left! Madame, calm down. Compose yourself. Find her and abort that damn baby! It's the only thing for it. Teacher. Yes? You know I love you. This is sudden. I want to get something for you. Wait here. I'll be back soon. Welcome, sir. That'll be 567 yen. Out of 1,000. That's 433 yen change. Thank you. Here you go. Thanks. Bottom of the 2nd, Abe is up to bat. This 80 innings hitless streak is the longest of his career. Can he overcome his slump tonight? I see Abe's parents sitting down near first-base seating. Now Abe is at the batter's box. You must make her have the abortion! She must get rid of the child! Now, now. Calm down. Get my daughter! Miss, a nice cold beer for you. I just got it. Here. What's this about? Just drink it. Is it good? Yes, it is. I'm glad. What's with that outfit, anyway? Just something. Wait over here. Congratulations. What's that noise? Some kids out partying? Maybe fireworks. Shall we go look? Right, don't lose spirit, ma'am. See you at the station tomorrow. - Right, then. - Let's go. Miss, I think this is a miracle. Right, Yasutaro? What miracle? What do you mean? How old are you? I'm nine. Nine years old, eh? Time you were home. What? I have a daughter the same age as you. Hey, did you let off fireworks, just now? Crap! Run for it! Hey, stop! Why are you running? Come here, you! Hey! What's this!? What's with the disguise? What are you hiding? I've done nothing wrong! She's wearing a padded bra. Give that back. That's no disguise! Let go of that! Abe misses another pitch. That's two in a row he's swung at. His timing is totally out. This is his last chance to get it right. OK, the pitcher is winding up for the pitch. Abe has connected with it! No mistake! This is a big one. Yes! He's done it! - Yes! - Abe has smashed a home run! 3 Years Later Teacher. What's with this place? Nothing changes around here. Same old country life. By the way... You haven't changed. Eh!? You certainly have improved. Sure, I've kept studying while I'm working. Good.
