DNC delegates, I hope you enjoyed your stay and to welcome you again. On the evening of the convention, refreshments for delegates will be extended by one hour. Welcome, ma'am. Come on, open that door! Please, we must be careful, they are coming. Circle the northwest corner. Stay back. Stay on the line and secure the entrance. What are they yelling? Rubber... and Yippie. - Don't lose sight of the group! - They come from the south and the north. They are arriving! I'm 30 meters from the east corner. The world is watching us! The world is watching us! The world is watching us! The world is watching us! - Everything is fine? - Yup. All right, let's go. Our car is waiting for us in the back. Until we meet again! They were a little older than Charlotte. Charlotte won't get involved in a riot. How do you know it? Because she is our daughter. "The world is watching us." È questo che urlavano. Questa è CHA, Chicago. Siamo arrivati. Ecco. Fai attenzione. - Grazie. - Fammi un favore. - Non fare tardi. - No, farò presto. Ti amo. - Che cos'è? - È un uovo. Un uovo quadrato? Una ragazza ha una parrucca a forma di uovo quadrato. Non l’ho capita. Forse bisogna essere ubriachi per capirla. È molto divertente. Dei ricchi di New York si trasferiscono in una fattoria diroccata, mamma. La moglie viene da un paese inventato, è buffa. - L'Ungheria esiste davvero. - Grazie al cielo lo sai. E i suoi capelli sono stupendi. Com'è andata la cena? Chiacchiere con le mogli degli avvocati e cibo da hotel. Ho ballato un cha-cha-cha con il socio più anziano. C'è stata una manifestazione Yippie. È stato molto... Era come... Potevi percepire... la tensione della folla che si avvicinava. Quei giovani poliziotti avevano la stessa età degli Yippies. - Come on slug, stand up! - It's early, mom. It's time to go. In the morning Erin will tell you how it ends. Thanks for keeping you here tonight. Good night, Erin. Good night. I've been asked to work on the Alderson case. I should follow along with Paul. It certainly won't be an easy process, consider the indictments and the evidence in our possession. But we will try to find a way forward. It would be very important for the studio to be able to win. It will be a difficult challenge. Everything is fine? Joy! Again? You should go to the doctor. I have an appointment next week. Would you like to massage my feet? I have ankles as big as Dumbo's. It is not true. - Oh, my God. - Lift your legs. Want to go through Kramer's file with me? You're the best helper we've ever had. - At college? - Absolutely. Yes, of course, but... maybe it can wait. There's one more thing that can't wait. Come here. You should take important cases more often. - I have to tell you something. - Oh really? Yup. - Honey... - Yes? Wait, the little girl. - All right, the doctor said so. - I know it... but i feel... i feel huge. Agree. - Sorry. - No, you don't have to apologize. Do not do it. I know, love, but I'm sorry. I guess I could be persuaded to do something else. Yup? And what? You have a big brain Why don't you use it? Oh yeah, I think I have an idea. - I really like. - Oh yes? Yup. - Let me know how it is. - All right. For now it's a great idea. "DIARY OF A RESTLESS HOUSEWIFE" I don't want to drink too much on the job. It's not a job if they don't pay you. Is it a good book? I wanted to read it when it came out, but then, you know, life. I do not know. A woman who has a breakdown, there is no trace of love. There is group therapy. Roy's mother gave it to me. It's strange for a mother-in-law to give away a book like this. What is that? I do not know. Doctor's orders. For when I hear... the nothing. It would be better to avoid. After Roy died, people started looking at me weird. People hang their heads, no one looks me in the face anymore. Maybe they look at you like that when they think you could jump in from the Wabash Avenue bridge. "Povera Lana". It's the only thing they can say. An incomplete thought. Here I am. To all things incomplete. Mrs. Griffin? - Did she go blonde for Mr. Griffin? - No, but I think he likes it. Erin and I will too. Your hair is beautiful. Blonds will be more, now they look earthy. He doesn't even want me to pierce my ears. I don't want people to think you're precocious. She's a woman now. - Women decide independently. - Shut up. Charlotte! - Do you have your period? - My goodness. - Stop that! - Treasure! Why do not you tell me? I'm ashamed. - Oh, no, stop it. - It happens to everyone. I know, but I don't want to talk about it. Stop it, that's it. - Do you need some help, honey? - Oh my God! Erin, when you first had them, you already knew everything, didn't you? Sorry, Erin, I was rude. I learned everything by myself. My father had just died and my mother... I know, honey, I'm really, really sorry. Now we put the pot on the table and get the green beans. What a good smell. - That good news. - Is anybody there? Ciao. - Let's eat? - Why don't we say a prayer? - We only do it on certain occasions. - I'd like to say it tonight, for Erin. Agree. "God is good. God is great." - "May he bless..." - "May he bless this house and this food too." Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Erin, pass me the plate. Honey, could you get a bottle of water in the kitchen? I forgot. - Are you OK? - Yes. I forgot to put it at the table. - Erin, how's your mom? - Good. I'm glad to hear it. Do you want more? Oh, that's terrible. All right, I... - I knew it. - You see... I should have avoided certain terms. Oh! Tesoro... you haven't lost your style. The real problem is that it seems to be written by Clarence Darrow. - You don't have to be soft on me, Will. - I like. - For real? - Of course. It's beautiful. Honey, is everything okay? I don't want to be the type of man who makes his wife cry. - No, it's the hormones. - Agree. - What are you doing? - I prepare dinner. - Come up. - You put Lou Reed on. No one cooks while listening to the Velvet Underground. Do you want to dance with me? - Agree. - Fantastic. Yup! Everything is fine? Does age make itself felt? Mamma! Cow! - Hello. - Where? - She recovered. He's already much better. - For real? - Is fine. - Oh, thank goodness. Thank you. Where's Charlotte? - She went to the canteen. - Well, thanks for coming. - Forget about it. - Listen, is the baby okay? Oh I do not know. - I'm sorry, it's there. - Okay thanks. Ciao. Griffin's cardiomyopathy in the first trimester of pregnancy it's a rare thing. But pregnancy is the cause of her heart failure. Okay, what's the cure? Not be pregnant. If it wasn't, the problem would resolve itself over time. Is it possible that there is no other cure? There will be something we can do. We could apply to the Council to authorize an abortion. What? Are there no other options? I'm afraid not. Charlotte will spend the night at Lena's house. Don't worry. Leave it to me, I'll make sure everything goes well. There are still so many things I wanted to do. The doctor said there is a possibility. We have to hold on to that. Because? Because we have no other choice. Maybe your study could help us. Your superiors are very powerful. I'm a criminal lawyer, you can't ask me that. I don't want to look for shortcuts, I don't break the rules. I follow them and I never lie. Will... How did we get to this? How the fuck did we get to this point? We did the right thing. I don't want to leave Charlotte. I want you to stay here, with me and Charlotte I've been clear? Joy, I don't know what... What do you want me to do? I wish we would go to church again. Let's check here. - Hello, Dr. Falk. - Greetings. - How are you? - Good. Good evening. I made some cookies. So, gentlemen, you know the details of the case. Mrs Griffin has applied to the Council to ask for an exception to the hospital policy and thus carry out the termination of your pregnancy. Do you realize this is an extraordinary request? Yes obviously. Is there any chance she will survive the pregnancy? Possibility? I would say yes. What is the percentage of patients who survive in these conditions? It's hard to say, maybe 50%. Is there a percentage that convinces you? He 20%? He 30%? The hospital only authorized the abortion once, in the last ten years. Did Mrs. Griffin know? No, he didn't know. I am here. The data in our possession for cases similar to this reassure me a lot. Term pregnancy and a healthy baby. I have no doubts about my decision, so I vote "no" to the interruption. Gentlemen? A healthy baby, is that all? Doesn't it say anything about the mother? No. No. No. No. No. Sorry. So. Insanity remains. If you can convince two psychiatrists that you are suicidal, the hospital will have no other choice. He will make her abort. Joy, Do you think you are suicidal? Yes, doctor. I really think so. You know, shotguns are very long. It should point under the jaw and pull the trigger with your foot. Just like Hemingway did. Yup, this is my plan. If the other psychiatrist disagrees, this is his plan B. See you. Salve. Come. I suggest you fall off a ladder. It worked for me. Dr. Campbell's office. Mamma! - I'm fine, I'm fine. - What were you doing? - I'm fine. I'm just... - Are you sure? I just slipped. I slipped. - Are you sure? - I'm fine. I'm fine. It's your turn. Better not make him wait. Good morning. I'd like to cash this check for my husband, please. Sure, Mrs. Griffin. One moment, please. Would you rather count them yourself, Mrs Griffin? No, I'm sure it's fine. Thank you. Wanna play, huh? I'm talking about that skirt, miss. Keep calm. Want to show legs, huh? I came for the... service. Sorry, I'm sorry. Hello Beautiful! Where do you go? - Watch where you go. - Come back here! PREGNANT? WORRIED? GET HELP! CALL JANE How do you do it? How do you go forward? As usual. I always have. That's what I will continue to do forever. I don't know how to fix the situation. I do. Hi, I'm Jane. Jane chi? Ours is a service for pregnant women. Hi, I'm Jane. Excuse me. The first time they all hang up. How does it work? - Joy? - Yup. Sali. This is not a taxi, get in front with me. Bene. So, you must be Jane. I'm Gwen. When will I see Jane? Hard to tell. How did you find us? Bus stop, Wicker Park. Seriously? Does your family live there? All right, put this on. Cover your eyes, we can't take any chances. Alone. Lean on my arm, it's not very far. Ciao. Be careful. Now you can take off the bandage. Thank you. Not at all. Ah, you pay first. - Thank you. - It's 600. - There are all. - I know it. Here we go. I too thought about giving up. But I didn't. And he is the best. Even if he is a capitalist pig. Are you ready? Yup. All right, I'll wait for you outside. - You... won't you stay? - It's between you and the doctor. Agree. Ready. One minute, please. INFECTED WASTE - What is he doing? - Oh, I... - I was just... - Thanks. But you know, it's not your job. Is he a cop? - How? - Answer the question. No. I'm not a cop, no. All right, fine. Take off your skirt and underwear, then put this on and lie down on the couch, thank you. Nail. Come forward. Bene. Oh, it's cold. Already. A policeman is obligated to say that he is. Si sdrai. Password? Sanger. The slogan seems a bit excessive to me. It will be excessive, but I would like to avoid prison. You are Joy, right? Yup. Please sit down. Virginia is preparing spaghetti. There would have been a vegetable as well, but my spinach got slimy. Some women get the chills after the surgery, but it goes away quickly. This will help you with the cramps. - They're not too strong. - They get worse after that. So, girls, which one of you is Jane? None of us. We are all Janes. - Virginia was the first. - Help yourself. It was not my intention. A friend called me and I found her a trusted doctor. Then a friend of hers called me, after a friend of her friend, and so... Here we are. Eating will make your blood sugar go up, then you'll need to rest for a few hours. Really, I feel good. You are one of those. Come? Like: "I'll be home in an hour, I don't need any help." - You should have put more salt in it. - There's some basil. Is not enough. “Circling” is not a word, you cheater shit. Where's the dictionary? You must be joking, honey. Why don't we have a dictionary? Because when I had to bargain with the mafia to get a decent rent for this place and for the studio, having at one's disposal only the money stolen from the rich ladies, no offense, Joy, buying a dictionary was not a priority. All right, sorry. - We ask Joy. - Yup. Joy, is "circle" right, for a "rounded, or circular-shaped" object? Really. - Does not exist. - Of course? - View? Does not exist. - Here you are. All right. During pregnancy our hormones rise. In the next few days they will drastically decrease and you will feel very sad, but don't worry, it's normal. Thank you. Of everything. Eat, then rest and go home. - It helps, trust me. There is little salt. - I do not trust you. Last night I started having cramps. So, I took some pills that Dr. Falk prescribed for me. This morning the cramps are gone. However, after lunch I went to the bathroom. And… there was blood. There was a lot of blood. It was very quick. I lost the little girl, Charlotte. He is now in heaven. - Do not say that. - Honey, it's normal to feel this way... Stop telling me how to feel. Let her go. Miscarriage? I would like to speak to the doctor. I'm so sorry, Will. It's not your fault. It's nobody's fault. Have a drink, here. It'll help you... ease the pain. I answer. Pronto? Give me a moment. It's Fran, she wants to talk to you. Pronto? How's the bleeding? Remember, even if she stopped she will start again, presto. Tell me something, I'm Virginia. Yes, of course, I know. On the third day we make the first follow-up call. Is your husband there? Playground renovation is important, but it will be very difficult to raise the necessary funds. You're good, Joy, you have potential. Are you taking antibiotics? - Of course. - Do you have a fever? Chills? No. He's out. I want to make sure you heal on time and recover. Here, I think so. How do I know? You can not. You'll understand when you're better. Look, I know it's short notice, but since you're better, I have an emergency and I need help. Our driver has food poisoning, I'm in trouble. A girl is waiting for us in your area. Can you go get her and take her there? No, I don't think that's a good idea. You have a car, right? Does your husband take you out? Yes but... Just once, go with her and we'll never ask again. Virginia, I'm... Thanks, you're saving us. Gwen will call you with instructions. No me... - Good. - Did you eat a piece? No. I hope the doctor is a nice man. Who cares? It's an embarrassing situation at least I'd like to have something nice to look at. It would be fun to fall in love with the doctor who gives you an abortion, don't you think? I have to collect the payment. Right. I only date rich men. It was my boss, I work at a bank. He is married. I've asked them to control themselves, but I guess they can't help themselves after a while. Or yes? He said he would take care of it and he did. Have you ever done this? No. You look very tense, Joy. That's a lot of money. A child would cost more. Has Virginia run out of activist escorts? I'm doing you a favor. We've met before, I'm Joy. It's true, yes, of course. Last time I had a different view. Excuse me. Sandra, I'll let you lie down for a while. Great job, Jackie O. I'm sorry it wasn't the morning you were expecting. You read my mind. I try to stop. Because? Maybe I'd like to sing opera in my next life. Our organizational meetings are held every Thursday. This is the address. I don't agree with what you do. That girl... What did he do? Have sex without any protection. She sleeps with a married man who paid for the procedure. It's so... careless. We help women we are not here to ask questions. And if we judged them all by how they present themselves, I could think of you as a gossipy housewife who prepares mediocre dishes and gets drunk drinking martinis on ice at four in the afternoon. With chocolate chip cookies. Thanks for the help, I really, really appreciate it. I make great coffee. Well well, look what Sister Mike brought us. Cookies, thank goodness! Am I cinnamon? Not my specialty, but I had a request. We were just about to start our meeting, please sit down. - Hello. - How are you? - Everything is fine? - Yes, my husband gave me ice. - Ice! - It's your turn, Maeve. Joanne, 29, last period eight weeks ago. She has the necessary money, but she is also deeply Catholic. Nail. Millie, 32, already has three children and can't handle another one. This is yours, Liz. He's also taking blood thinners for a congenital heart defect. I'll ask Dr. Dean what he thinks. I'll take it. So, Rose, 31, last period five weeks ago. He's in Forest Park and only has $200. - Do you have a daughter? - Yup. My pride and joy. Charlotte, she's 15 years old. This service is a daughter for me. I have to defend her, I can't trust anyone. Can I trust you? Because I don't need tourists or a guilty housewife who snitches with the cops. Are you a spy? No. - Hey. - Hello. - Duties? - In an art class. At the public university, I told you so. It was really good, Will, I had forgotten how much I love to paint, even if I'm not very good at it. It keeps me busy, you know how it is. It distracts me. You dressed up for an art class. They have gowns. How did it go for you? The Kramer case is killing me. Berry is all over me, he wants me to work harder. I came home and nobody was there, not knowing where you were. The frozen meatloaf made me bored. We eat it three times a week because my wife goes to art class. To... i need to be with other people. Who think and act. I'll make you a drink. Fancy a Manhattan? All right. You don't have to tell my mom, do you? It's your decision. - It's my first time. - I hope so. I didn't know I could get pregnant like this. We were standing. I don't know how things work over there. Joy, surely you explained this to your daughter, do you want to try? Izzie... You have... a vagina. All right, that's enough. Hold this. All right. Here is the vulva. These are the lips. In here instead is the vagina. This is the vaginal canal. It looks like a rabbit. Up here is the cervix and then the uterus. These... These are the ovaries, there are eggs. Please tell me you at least know what a clitoris is. Lo to. No. Here it is. Joy. What's up? Shaking like a dog at the vet, I can't proceed. She's too nervous, can you help her? Please. - Her name is Marion. - Thank you. Marion. I can not do it. I can not. I know I have to, but... I understand you, I was also so scared. You did it? Yes. Dr. Dean did it, yes. Did it hurt you? Yup. But you know what? It took us 20 minutes. Twenty minutes is nothing compared to the rest of your life. And then you can do whatever you want. - Agree. - Good. I will stay with you. I can? The important thing is that you hold it still. Yup. All right. Twenty minutes and then we're going to eat spaghetti. Hello, foreigner. You are up early. Who has time, don't waste time. Will you stop for a while? I can't, I have an art class. I've been very busy. What happens? It's all under control. Bene. If you need me, you know where to find me. Is it 600 dollars? Is there any goods you can sell, Mrs Burr? I'm afraid not. My husband would notice. Are there other possibilities? An installment payment? Perhaps... I'm so sorry. You will get used to it. They ask for a loan, or for alms. They sell everything they have, or convince boyfriends. Why is Dean charging so much? He can afford it. We have to help her. We should, but we can't help those who can't pay. Do you smoke? Everyone smokes. Come on, blow and pass it, Joy. Is gorgeous. How do I get you back stoned by your husband? Give me a moment to wake up. - Wool. - Hello. Joy hasn't come home yet. I cooked a little more and thought I'd bring it to you, or I'd freeze it. I guess you and charlotte are craving something homemade. You just have to heat it in the oven. Can I bake it like this? Don't tell me you've never used an oven. I show you how it's done. Agree. Did you bring dinner? Give her a hand. No honey, there's no need. Where does she keep the good service, your mother? We only use it for holidays. For real? I use it every day. It makes me feel, I don't know, rich. - It's nonsense, isn't it? - Yup. No it is not. Indeed, Charlotte, tonight we use the good service. Every day is a party. Yes, this is the right spirit. - Where is it, dear? - In the dining room. Do you take it? Why not. A thousand thanks. It is a pleasure. Lynette, 40, last period ten weeks ago, has $37. The next. What bullshit. These women need to be helped just as much as those with money. We can't change the rates, Joy, that's the way the economy works. It's interesting how the economy always seems to penalize black women. We also give up a lot of white women, if it makes you feel any better. Please, can we not make it a race issue? Look around you, Virginia. Yes, we are a group of white ladies, but that's not the intent. I don't care what the intent is, I care about the results. You haven't worked hard enough with the Panther Sisters. And then you insulted the Black Feminist Alliance. They were nuts, yelling at me about abortion and black genocide. They are not splashes. I knew you would, is that I do not understand how you remain so indifferent. Black genocide is not for crap, Virginia. I shouldn't have used that word. How dare you? Gwen, stop it, we marched in Memphis together. Let's start again. I don't know what to tell you, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to pay for all black women for surgery? Why not? Just do it. Liar, drink. But stop it, wouldn't you rather I take off my pants? Drink. All right, yours. It's your turn. How old are you? What a son of a bitch. Well, take off your shirt. You don't decide what I get off. The game doesn't work like that. You are a real pain in the ass. That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me. - Now it's my turn. - Yup. - What is your IQ? - One hundred and eighty-four. For real? Is it the Stanford-Binet test, or the Wechsler test? - Liar. - Oh, come on. I think it's time to stop asking these questions. We could take it all off, what do you say? You can admire me. I love women older than me. Good to know, Dean. Oh my God. I'm all yours. That's enough. All right. Yup. So what do you want? A favor. I know you lowered the rate by $100. For some women it is still too much. Cut it out, please. Seven years of medicine, do you know how much I spent? I support my mother and the mafia also wants its share. I have very little left. What if I earned more? I listen to you. What if we guaranteed you ten surgeries a week? Every week. At my rate? At your rate. In return, every week, you'll have to make two for free. One. And now you take off your panties. I just watch. I do nothing more. Two and I take off my blouse. Now. Do you have a bra? - Done deal. - Good. We have to celebrate. It begins. Yup! Oh yes. Turn around, turn around! Oh come on! You said you didn't have a bra on. I do not have it. I do not have it. Agreements are agreements, Dean, I took off my blouse. Go fuck yourself. Good night, Dean. Carry the vodka with you. Great deal. You are truly amazing. Two free surgeries every week. That's the deal. - Where's the catch? - There's always a catch. We need to find more women willing to pay. Will black women have priority? The idea is this. Yup. Like this. Optimal. I have to go to the bathroom, can you give her ergometrine? I will do as you showed me last time. Thank you. Here we go, Judith, one more injection. This it's just to keep you from losing too much blood. - I hate syringes. - Like all. The good news is that this injection is given in the thigh. Ready? - All right. - Take a deep breath. Are you ready? And now exhale. Done. I did not hear anything. Perfect. Now Dr. Dean will dilate you. Thank you. Before starting the surgery, I have to dilate the cervix, okay? We're almost done. All right. It's a shame. You have a talent for this stuff. You could have been a nurse. Or the doctor. Could you start assisting me more. I mean, with a woman the patients would be less tense. What are you thinking about? It's a great view. In five years I will have the corner room. Yes, that has a spectacular view. April. What is that? Let's see'. I thought you deserve a meal that isn't frozen. Wow, amore. - Thank you. - You know I can't cook. - But no... - I don't know how to cook meatballs like this. - Don't you have to work? - Calm. How's the art class going? They make us work really hard. - But it's wonderful. - Why don't you ever take anything home? Tesoro, I don't paint well enough to bring my work here. Well, I'd like to have your painting in my room. But if you don't want to, that's fine. Thanks for making me feel like Picasso. Now don't overdo it. I want to learn the whole procedure. You will teach me. Sure why not. Then someone else can teach you to operate on the brain, or on the heart. Why not. Do you think anyone can learn to operate? You succeeded, clearly. Even if you are not a doctor. Do you want to see my degree? No, that would be false. How, sorry? At the University there is no record of your name, you have never attended medicine. Which makes sense, come to think of it. Why would a real doctor risk being disbarred to perform clandestine abortions in a dilapidated apartment? Cow. My studio is not dilapidated, if you do not mind. Maybe I want to help women. Have you ever thought about it? If that were true, you'd be charging a lot less. My rate is absolutely reasonable. You own a swimming pool. I'm the best doctor you have. Don't make me tell Virginia you're not a real doctor. You have to teach me. Please. Please. Lesson number one. - Have you ever taken the seeds out of a pumpkin? - Of course. It's the same, for most procedures. Thirty-five, lives in Chicago, week six... Joy. Are you organizing a party? A bake sale. - For charity. - Is there one for us? Sure, I'll cut you a slice. Great, they look delicious. Now he will give you another injection. It's to keep you from bleeding too much. You will feel no pain. Are you ready? Let's take a deep breath. inspire, turn. Done. One minute and it will take effect. Come here. Like this? Don't make me regret it. It's not that hard, Virginia. I could do it by myself. And you too. What did you smoke? We're not doctors, Joy. Neither is Dean. What? Oh shit. I promised I wouldn't tell you. - Holy shit. - It's not complicated. It's a quick procedure that a man with no medical training taught himself. - As safe as a tonsillectomy. - What does a surgeon do. We could do it. We will be able to offer the intervention free of charge. No. Don't talk about it, it's too risky. - We take risks even on the phone. - No. We limit the risks to a minimum, we are cautious, we pay those responsible. Do you think it's a coincidence that they haven't caught us? You are right. But we are entirely dependent on a man who is not a real doctor. If I let you do it and you screwed up just once, if even one woman died... Think about it. Not to mention it would be murder. It's clear? I'm not afraid of prison, I've been there. ARRESTS FOR ABORTIONS RUN BY THE MAFIA I'm afraid there won't be anyone left to answer that phone. It's supposed to be a sheperd pie, but it looks like meat noodles. I find it delicious. Do you agree, Joy? Great. I wish I'd learned how to make beef noodles in high school. You don't really say. You say that to be nice, you are. And it's good, it's true. But I don't think you would have wanted to learn how to cook it. You are a man, household chores were useless for you. You were busy with wrestling at the time and studying for law school, which is great. But our daughter at school learns how to wash dishes. Did something happen today? Something that upset you? No, I had a wonderful day. I like the subjects I follow. I liked them too, but that's not the point. In case there were any doubts, I would like to clarify my position. Women can become whatever they want. The important thing is that they always prepare dinner. This isn't right, come on. I absolutely agree. I'm going to reheat the pumpkin pie. I put it in the oven. What are you laughing at? These are the women who can pay. But these can't. We're going to need an answering machine. There are two free interventions a week, how will we dispose of them? How are we going to decide who gets priority? We have to enter this girl, she was raped. Free spots most often go to rape victims. Then? Is it the parameter for deciding who gets free surgery? You mean they don't deserve it? Of course not. I say this 11 year old deserves it, Or this mother of eight who's about to be evicted. - She was raped. - Never mind. This lady has cancer and can't have chemo if she's pregnant. Do we make it pay? I vote for Rita. He's finishing a dissertation on homelessness in American cities. It could do good for others. - Come on, she was raped. - Agree. It's a mess. At least, before we discarded those who could not pay. It must be a random choice. We are not here to judge the lives of these women, this is not how we work. What bullshit, for some it's a matter of life and death. It is for everyone. You have only one chance. - Have you seen my keys? - Why are you so nervous? I'm not. It's Sunday, relax. Did your dad say when he's coming back from golf? All right, where are you going? I told you, it's a live drawing session for art class. Earlier you said it was lunch. So why did you ask me? See you this afternoon, for dinner there's pasta. Prepare some hot water in a pot to sterilize the tools. Where's Joy? Oh, damn. It's 11:20, do you think he's had second thoughts? I will beat her to death with a rolling pin. Maybe we should call Dean. - We thought you weren't coming anymore. - Women of little faith. Hope you had your coffee. Where is the doctor? Tell me you're kidding. Coincidentally, she was just the first girl on the list. It's Karma. Thank you. I remember you. I remember you too. This is for the bleeding. I would like to become a mother one day. You will, but not this time. Bene. Let's start with the expansion. We'll widen your cervix, then proceed with the extraction. Are you really gonna do it? Yes, but this is my first time doing the surgery myself. You understand it? What was your first grade teacher's name? I do not remember exactly. I think it was... Mrs Milligan. What did he look like? His hair was gray and curly, so small and thick as to look like a helmet. He wore only green sweaters. Are you serious? - How are you feeling, are you okay? - Yup. Take it easy. Breathe. Now I'm going to use the curette, you may feel some pressure. How do you know where to step in? I can't see everything, so I visualize what I know is there, then I find it using touch. Let's begin. Deep breaths. He pays attention to me makes me feel so... bene. He says if I love him, I have to sleep with him, otherwise... I might have some problems. I wish he would love me, but he takes what he wants and then walks away. I feel so stupid. You're not stupid, honey. But he looks like an idiot. I'm going. Everything is fine. You're doing great. I was setting up the model for a new painting. I told her everything. Did you get this far alone? I know how to use public transport, it's not difficult. You wrote the address in your address book. I actually thought you had a lover. Thing? Oh, no, I have no lover. Would have been better. I will answer all your questions. I have no questions, I don't want to know anything. Non... I don't want to hear about dead children, people killed, the sky or Vietnam. It's an answering machine. So we won't miss any messages. Cutting-edge technology. I told Dean we don't need him anymore. - Thing? - Already. I dedicated my life to defending various causes, if you fought, I was there. Marches, protests, sit-ins. There were groups of kids yelling Marxist theories on the City Hall steps, excluding all women, we had no voice. It was time for revenge. Think you can do 20 surgeries this week? Yup. Yup? Yup! Well, let's wait. How was this feminist association born? - Jane? - Joy. My wife's name is Joy, Detective. Yes, he told me. But one person holds... various personalities. Right, Joy? Maybe. Like her. Well... I'm from the police. I look like an extremist. Or a drug addict. I like multiplicity. My looks are just a way of doing my job. It's a mask. You wear one. Vero, Joy? We have a mutual friend, Helen Burr. Io... I don't know anyone with this name. My old friend Carl is married to Helen. Lu called me and she told me that she contacted you about a you-know-what, but it did not work. He couldn't afford it. Helen is a good woman. He didn't name names. He didn't say anything, just that it wasn't your fault. You see, she put something in her private parts, something that shouldn't be there. She ended up in the hospital. She almost died. I don't know anything about it. Right. It's what I imagined. Do you know a doctor at the hospital, Dr. Falk? Yes, he's my wife's gynecologist. He is also my brother in law. So if, hypothetically, I asked him to say that one of his patients is hiding something shady, something that nearly killed another of her patients... Detective, my wife has never received a single speeding ticket. I assure you that you would never get involved in such a thing. What a shame. This woman will call Jane. And at that point, Jane will provide you with a service. She is a friend of mine. Most cops have girlfriends. Excuse me, Detective, my wife doesn't know anything about this affair, okay? There is a fee. Five hundred, right? Six hundred. Make sure Jane gets this message. Thank you, Mrs Griffin. No, it's not necessary, I know where the exit is. Can I ask you a few questions, or would you just keep lying? Ask me anything you want. Tu... organize... of illegal abortions? - Safe abortions. - Oh, please. I can not believe it. Do you want to go to jail? - Of course not. Joy, this is... You are an accomplice to multiple crimes. We may request... extenuating circumstances, denouncing the doctor who performed the operations. I can not do that. Why never? Because? Because... I am that doctor. It's me. Did you do the operations? It's not a real operation, it's a simple procedure. Joy, what are you doing? Are you operating on people? - I had to do it. - When the fuck can you be stupid? I had to do it. - I told you to stop. - Did you involve our daughter? You don't even see me, don't pay attention. Charlotte! Charlotte! Charlotte! She went to Lana's. Virginia, I'm Joy. Is it okay if Charlotte stays over here with you? - Yes, of course, it's not a problem. - Thank you. Don't worry. We can talk about it if you want. It is not... You think you're in control of your life, but instead, Suddenly, you realize… which is not so. When Roy's boss called and told me about the heart attack, that they could do nothing to save him, I remember staring at the wallpaper. I had the impression that it was peeling off. It was as if the whole house was… falling apart. There is no worse feeling in the world. Whatever you're going through, I'm sorry. Sorry, I'm so sorry, I don't know what came over me. - No, you're sorry. - You don't have to apologize, I did everything. I always do this, I apologize all the time. I've always apologized and I will continue to do so. Excuse me. Please. Charlotte needs you. I need you. Will, I have to tell you something. No, non serve. Nixon won. For real? They announced it an hour ago. I voted for him. Roy would have voted him out. I wanted to vote for Humphrey. But I forgot about it. Are you a Democrat? Don't tell Will. One day I will tell him. I wanted to help you deal with what you've been through during this time. Sai, with pliers and all. Instead I was focused on myself. Calm. Calm. Thanks for telling me. There was no need. Did you say "pliers"? Seriously? What you are doing? Eh? What I should do. Do you know what happens to pregnant women over time? They become even more pregnant. Charlotte, go see Erin, please. Because? I already know everything. He's right. What we do works. Let's do something useful. Maybe it's not perfect, but it works. And since you've decided to stop answering the phone, I have a hundred women waiting for the intervention of a doctor, that is you. You're all I Have. You are all we have. Come on, you can't just garden and go to parent-teacher meetings. This is not the Joy I know. Second. So you can realize who you are abandoning. I'm sorry. Hello, can I talk to Jane? I need help please. I don't know what to do. I have 43 dollars. This is my fourth post. I'm losing hope, I thought you'd help me. Ready? My friends gave me this number. I'm 15, I'm from Riverside, I took two buses to come to Chicago. Now I'm at the Travel Lodge, it's on Roosevelt. Stanza 116. I can't tell my parents. I'm here alone. Mamma. You must return. Pronto? I found a guy asking for an $800 fee, but he has a very bad way of treating patients. - He's never lost a patient. - All right, it's a start, well done. Baptist ministers are running a network in New York, I think we might have someone there, but the travel costs are high. Optimal. Keep it up, perfect. You're back. With a pumpkin. I will teach you how to do it. Anyone who wants can learn. I will stay here as long as necessary, to make you the best. At that point, I'll leave. I will raise all the money I can to keep you going and keep you safe. That's what I can do for you. In exchange for everything you've done for me. As you may have guessed, I know a lot of people in suits and burdened, full of money. All right? Let's get to work. We performed nearly 12,000 abortions before the raid. Not a single woman died, not one, just like that. Do you know who made it possible? It was you. And you. And you too. All of you. But is there one of you who was brave enough to show us the way, showing us what we were capable of. Who knew we could do it ourselves. And so it was. He even bailed us out, helping us fight to clear our names. I happen to be married to an outstanding criminal lawyer, that got us out of trouble and that helps her talk to those old bastard capitalists to make them shell out their money. I think that lawyer would say the same thing I'm saying. That he's lucky to have Joy Griffin by his side. Like all of us. You know what? We also have those seven men on the Supreme Court to thank. The other two, screw them. I never thought I'd publicly thank seven men. For no reason. Anyway, we made it, because you showed us that we could. This is a strange occasion. We will close our doors, because our work is no longer needed and I couldn't be happier. Therefore, This is goodbye, but I hope it's also goodbye for new battles. Now, I'd really like it if you burned the first ticket, baby. It is an honor. Geraldine, 15 years old. Sally, last period eight weeks ago. So what's the next item on the list?
