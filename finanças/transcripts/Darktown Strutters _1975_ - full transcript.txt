Any word from Mom? - No, not yet. - How long's it been? - Well, I bit the neighbor's dog on June 23rd. - Got your letter. - Ain't that a bitch? Mama went to work one day and just disappeared, never came back. - Well, where's she work? - Cross foundation. I filed a missing person report, but the police arrested me for filing a false report when they couldn't find her. - Once more. - They said it was something about balancing the books. Made sense to the judge. I just got out doing ten days. - You mean she been missing that long. - Mhm, everybody's gone. Where you been? - Me and the sisters been riding down America, keeping the wind on us, y'know. Not stopping long enough to take a deep breath. - Well, did you find anything? - Just missed it. - Probably them noisy motorcycles scared it off. Vroom, vroom, vroom. - Don't come down on my bike. Now I don't bring down your trips. We're into the same thing. - Sorry, sister. - What is it. What are you into these days? - I thought you'd never ask. I'll show you! [door crashing] - Kung fu? - Near. - Still breaking through doors. - Way beyond kung fu. An ancient African art practiced by the imperial guards in the Zambezi River Basin. - Who taught you? - An old man rang the bell. He was selling subscriptions to Life magazine.

[Syreena laughing] [front of house crashing] [harmonica music] [crowd cheering] - I've asked you ladies and gentlemen of the press here this afternoon, so that I might explain the ambitious program we are about to embark on in the black community. [crowd cheering] As you know, the Cross Foundation is a think-tank dedicated to improving the lot of our black brothers and sisters. [crowd cheering] The black man has been very good to me. I'm to see that he is aware of my gratitude. [crowd cheering] I believe it is important that he know that while some may ignore their responsibility, I do not. [crowd cheering] - Who's that ass? - That's Commander Louisville Cross, Sky Hog Barbecue millionaire, and founder of the Cross Foundation, Sister, bio? - No, you're doin' fine. - Now, I intend to see that those who gave it to me get it back. - Get it back, get it down, blow your faith out. - A real fox, huh fellas? - Spell it! - F-O-X. [crowd laughing] - Lorelai? I'm Cinderella's daughter, Syreena. I would like to talk to you, if I could. - Syreena, your mother spoke of you. You're some kind of a motorcycle tramp. - Mother wrote about you, too. - Have they found her yet? They will, now, don't you worry. She's probably off on some mission of mercy, always doing something for somebody else. - When did you see her last? - Oh, about two weeks ago. She showed up for work, and we checked out our pails and mops. - [Woman] You take that big thing away from me! - Would you like a bite? Stuck-up. [dogs barking] - What do you think happened to her? Any idea? - I don't know if I should. - Please. - Well maybe your mother didn't tell you, but she was organizing a place where girls could go who were gonna be mothers and didn't want to. - You mean, abortion? - Please don't say it. She was organizing women doctors to help. - Have you seen my mother? - Mother superior? - Cinderella. - Oh, I'm not much on shoes, Sister. Food's more my line. - Love your barbecue. [banjo music] - Afternoon folks. What can I get for y'all? - I'll take a Cotton Chopper, and a Levy Shake. - Get me a Suwanee River. - Yes, ma'am! - You gon' be in town for a while? - Looking for my mama. - Really? I been looking for my daddy. - Somebody's always missing. - Yeah, yeah. [groovy 70's music] [tires squealing] - You know your fly's open? - Did you hear what she said to me? [laughing] - [Man] Do you have anything for rope burns? [laughing] - [Man] Try to get it straight this time, Hugo. Their first position was here. Now, their second position was over here, and, Hugo. Hugo? Hugo! [siren wailing and firecrackers popping] 77th and Normandy. - That's a bad spot! - Nigger alarm! - Tricycle squad, away! [crashing and clattering] - Where'd everybody go? Oh! Oh! Nigger alarm! Hey, I'm stuck! - Tubbins, where are you? Come on, fatso. There's an alert at 77th and Normandy, come on. [Syreena whistling] - This is 77th and Normandy. - Holy cow pucky. Hey fellas, the tactical alert is here at the station house! [police officers chattering] - Search every room! - I'll check the woodpile. [jazzy drums] Pardon me. - Hold that. Jesus, everybody's up-tight because of a little get-up. - It's not just the get-up, Inspector, but I was expecting a straight. - Don't be too sure I'm not. There's a white female rapist on the loose, and she prays on black male faggots. - Well, that outfit ought to drive her crazy. - I sure hope so. [in falsetto] I certainly hope so. Okay, what is it you want? - I want to know why you haven't found my mother. - Another missing person, what's her name? - Cinderella. - Cinderella? You ain't the only one looking for her. Vice wants to talk to her about illegal operations. - She's a spy? Golly gee. - None of that street talk on me, huh? Anyway, missing persons is out of its head. Several prominent black males have been reported missing in the past two weeks. - And these prominent black males are far more important than missing women? - [Police Officer] Hey, you know what'd look good in her? - [Police Officer] Yeah, me. - [Police Officer] Oops, sorry. Hope the stick wasn't too cold. - Well, they seemed to like me. - [Officer Emmo] I hear something down here! - Where, where? - There! - There! - No! No! [guns firing] - Look out officer, there might be more of them! Cover her, men! - It was... It was... It was... - Now we'll never know. - You sure fooled them, inspector. Better get a sponge and a pail, there's been an accident. - Happens all the time, we'll just hose it out. - [Officer Tubbins] Oh, excuse me. - [Officer Babel] Approach with caution, men. - [Woman] How much is this? - That's $2. - [Woman] And this? - That one is $2.95. - [Woman] Oh, how much for this item? - That ain't no item, missus, that's an electric can opener. - [Woman] Oh, fantastic. - Never thought it was much to look at. - [Woman] Where do you get these? - I buy them from folks. - [Woman] And where do they get them? - They steal them from you folks. - [Woman] And? - And I sell them back to you folks, like the world just keeps going round and round. - I think that is detestable! You ought to be reported. - Syreena, my sweet angel! - Hi, Grandpa, how you doing? - Just fine, just fine. This here is Mrs. Parasol. - Mrs. Charles Parasol. - Hi, Charles. - What is that outfit? - I don't know. I saw Miss Judy Eisenhower wearing one on television. - I'll take that. - I'll wrap it. - This is outrageous! - Thanks, it's nice to be appreciated. - I don't think you should've done that. - Hell, Grandpa, don't let them scare you anymore. Those days are gone. - It ain't that. She's my welfare caseworker! You find your mama yet? Never could figure her out. Even when she was little she wasn't like other girls. - Just had to live is all, though. - Well, what do we have here? - Mrs. Parasol's can-opener. - Take that right around the corner there. - Flash tell you she was gone? - Flash, he don't talk to me no more, he's ashamed of me. I'm out of style. - You had to wait, though. It wasn't easy. If you didn't, wouldn't none of us be left here on Earth. - They was a might nasty in those days. Some men came by here looking for a girl your mama helped. I don't remember her name. They's the ones who told me about your mama being gone. - What color were they? - Full red, round the neck. Listen, you try Philo Raspberry, the private detective, he owes me a favor. I been doing his shoes for years, so he better help you, too. [explosion] [groovy 70's music] - I'm looking for Philo Raspberry, private dick. - You found him, sister. - I need your help, baby. I got a tiny problem. My mother's disappeared, and somebody said you were good at finding people. - I'm too busy, baby. I gotta find eight missing men first. Somebody's ripping off to clean the ghetto. I gotta be careful myself, 'cuz I live inside, too. - You could be next. - You really think so? - Sure, baby. But it's like rape. You got to ask for it. - Garcon. Well, I can rest as spades spook the kinda nasty niggas of Harlem. - Oui, monsieur. - Bring this lovely dumpling a methuselah of my finest champagne from my private stock. - Oui, monsieur. Oui-oui to you, then? - Alright, let's knock off this Lauren Bacall shit. Now we both know how you're supposed to act. Madame. Don't worry my dear. Love will find a way. [champagne pops] - Shit. This is the worst shit I have ever drank. What is that? Do you get that from the toilet? No wonder it's private stock. Philo, you don't have to worry about getting kidnapped. Not with tastes like that. - That was beautiful! - Thank you. - I wasn't gonna tell you this, but I knew your mother, Cinderella. She never put us down for what we were. - What do you know? - A girl named Lixie. She hooks for a black pimp named Casabah Volt. Your mother tried to help her, but she was a real hard case, baby. [crowd chattering] [carnival music] - Aw, I can do better than that with my head, man. [spring bouncing] [game dings] - Hey, let's ride double. - Strut off. Hi-ho Silver, away! - What are trying to do, go through life like some kind of John Wayne or something? Y'know I heard about that dump you put on Philo Raspberry. Y'know what, sister Syreena, you ain't gettin' none by cuttin' men. - They'll grow back. Yours did. I ain't gonna pretend muscle turns me on. - Yeah, but don't you ever need somebody to just hold you, y'know, to love you? I mean, try me. You'll like me. [dramatic music] - [Red Hood] Well! We finally get a chance to talk. - Call first, I'm in the book. - I'd like to bring you up on a rollercoaster myself, but I been told to deliver you a warning. [Strutters and Mellow's boys shouting] [siren wailing] - [Red Hood] Well, I guess I showed them. Now for a speedy flight to my bike, and a quick get away. Up, up, and away! - Alright, alright!

Yeah, she mentioned you. Did you find her yet? - No, girl, but the trail leads to you. - They been looking for me, and I don't know why. - Well, who is? - I don't know. - Well, tell me how you got mixed up with my mama. What was happening? - It's a long story. - It's a long winter, girl, come on. - I split from Casabah Volt's love factory, and went to this home I heard some church was running. Some white dude by the name of Tilly. It was a runaway home for mothers, so I told him I was running, they took me in. - But, where is this home? - Over on Vermont, and listen, after I was there for a week, I started to feel real funny, like I was a hind downer. Then things really started to get fuzzy. - Did they drug you? - Yeah, took me somewhere late at night. [dogs howling] I woke up for a moment, and I heard them say something about a cross. It was some kinda hospital. - That's scary. - The next day I was back at the house, and they told me I had been sick and was dreaming. A couple of weeks later, I found out I was pregnant. - Stop! - Yeah, honey. Now, I hadn't been... You know, for a long time. So you know I had to get out of that place quick, fast, and in a hurry. I went over the wall, honey. - Go ahead on, run it, girl, run it. - Well, I heard about your mother, so I went to her, and she helped me not be pregnant. - She would. - I ratted down to her about the runaway house, and she took off to see Tilly, and she never did come back. - Well, thanks, I'll let you know if we hear anything. You'll be okay here? - Great. Making pot-sicles by the score. [clanging piano notes] ♪ It's on the floor ♪ That good old love you got, you got to let it go - You missed me! Please try again. I made it! - Well if they got Philo, they must have everybody they want. - Maybe they got him to mix the drinks or something. [clattering] - Come on now [drowned out by Flash]. - Get on in here, you jive turkey, you. - Don't you know that I'm... Say what are you doing down there girl, playing in that filth, will you get up from there? - Beat him. - What? - Yeah, but before I do, I see something I want. You see anything you like, Flash? - Wait a minute, look, look, what do you want? - Who's paying the bills at the runaway house? - Now why are you asking me that? I'm just the numbers man. You want to get something down? - Yeah, we gonna get you down in something. - Now, look it's even money they got some kinda poverty money or something, why? - Shutup. - Say, man, now, she gonna kill me if I don't talk, and you gonna kill me if I do, huh? Just show me how I get out of here? - Once more. - The Cross Foundation. They put money into it. - How do you know, fella? - I pick up the paychecks of some of the people over there. They bet losers, y'know. - How come they ain't kidnapped you Six Bits? You big time. - How come they ain't kidnapped you? - Oh, I been deferred. - Listen, my mama's been kidnapped. - Three to one, you never see her again. - I'll take some of that. - I got $20 against my clothes, say that I'm the next to go. - Aw, take it. Ol' Sky Hog Cross, payin' for runaway house. How do you like that? - That don't mean nothing to me. - Lixie was taken to some sort of hospital. Cinderella was working for the Cross Foundation. Keeps coming up Cross. Now I've asked enough questions, and I've done enough looking. Now I'm gonna show 'em some righteous action! [garage door crashing] - Did you see that! [tires squealing] - [Red Hood] Oh, you did it again! You're gonna work without a net if you continue to do this all the time. [tires squealing] - Get this thing off me! [bell ringing] - [Red Hood] Meet the Messiah. - [Syreena] Don't you look like Little Red Riding Hood. - That's me, my dear, when I was in military school. We were pig tendin' champions that year. I thought it only fitting that I welcome you myself. - Ol' Sky Hog himself. Where's my mama? - If I appear rude, I apologize, but dinner is nearly ready. Perhaps you'd like to join me. - If it's that Suwanee River of yours. - Oh, my ribs. Bone-sucking good. [Cross clapping] [harmonica music] Dismissed. [Cross clapping] Their costumes were my idea. What do you think? Oh, eat, eat, I cooked the ribs myself. More mayonnaise? Y'know, after a hard day of the hog work, hanging around listening to the darkies complaining, being nice and sweet, I like to come out here, stand in this room, and lean back and yell as loud as I can. [cheery music] - Gentlemen, be seated! - This year's a rocker though. - Yes, Mister Bones? - Little Rusty said his first half-word today. - His first half-word, you say? - No, he said. Just listen. - I am listening! What was his first half-word? - Mother. [all mock laughing] ♪ Gone are the days ♪ When my heart was young and gay ♪ Gone are my friends ♪ From the cotton fields away ♪ Gone from the earth ♪ To a better land I know - I'm coming, I'm coming. - I'm leaving, I'm leaving. ♪ I'm coming, I'm coming ♪ For my head is bending low ♪ I hear those gentle voices calling ♪ "Old Black Joe" - I had to start as a kid, selling ribs to darkies. Your entire race has held it against me. All their white hatred, taken out on me. But I just kept a-smiling and collecting the money. But the world is about to turn. - A regular Disneyland. - Oh, perhaps you recognize these men. Some of the finest examples of the black community. Everybody happy? - Yeah. But who cooked them ribs? - Oh, Philo. - Syreena. See, they got me. See, they really wanted me. [Syreena shouting] Syreena! - I'd like to show you something. Are you familiar with the biological process called cloning? - Uh-uh. - Cloning is the first totally asexual reproductive process. The scientists at the Cross Foundation perfected it. - [Syreena] You mean you can have babies without the... Getting it on? - Women have nearly been eliminated from the reproductive process. - We can use the rest. - You see, certain cells are removed from the body of the donor, such as those of the black men we kidnapped. Fertilized in the womb of one of our mothers, the cells become a fetus, and are then transplanted to our miracle machine. The baby is programmed an exact duplicate, genetically, of his father, and if allowed to mature, he'll grow up at the normal rate. [bouncing spring] He will be an exact physical duplicate of his father. - But his father would always be years older. - Oh, but this here contrivance, I call it Growing Up, accelerates the process. Total physical and intellectual maturation can be controlled and assimilated as the clone grows in a matter of hours to the exact age of the donor. - And you have an exact duplicate of, say, a prominent black figure? - Exactly. These highly respected black puppets will then endorse my political aspirations and I will effectively control the black vote. All my work will be rewarded. - And that's it. - That's right. I think it's pretty damn clever. - Why don't you grab white celebrities? White folks vote, too. - My own people? - You grabbed my mama for a few lousy votes. - Votes are power. - Why me, pig? - You're a fanatic. Fanatics don't learn. Your mother was a fanatic. - She found out you were behind runaway mamas. - Worse. She spied on the Cross Foundation. She found out we were kidnapping blacks. She wouldn't cooperate. [wailing] The labor pains are starting right on time! Sometime today, our first full-grown clone is gonna emerge from that, no, that end of this here machine. And, if the process is deemed a success, we can begin eliminating our donors. - Painlessly? - I haven't really made a decision on that. - Left piggy, left piggy, left piggy, left piggy, halt. Left piggy, left piggy, left piggy, left piggy, left piggy, left piggy, left piggy, left piggy, left piggy, left piggy, forward, march. Left piggy, left piggy, left piggy. - Wasn't the ribs delicious? [blowing raspberry] Syreena. - Oh, please, no ribs, please. - Honey, I got something better here than ribs. - What you got? - You got to get out of here, and tell the world what this man's done. - You know he stole a recipe from me and Ben. - That hog. - Tell the world, honey, tell the world. - I'll tell them about that mayonnaise, too.

Whoo, ow! That's great, Ron. That's real bad, Dramatics, I loved it. - Syreena, aren't you gonna stay and hear "And I Panicked?" - Oh, I'd love to, but I got it on tape. I really gotta run. - [The Dramatics] Hey, you go that way. - Seeya! - [Cinderella] Syreena! Remember when you were a little girl and you asked me why men get to keep their names when they got married and women didn't? - Oh, yes! - [Cinderella] You remember what I said? - No. - [Cinderella] I don't either, and it's bothering me. - Mama! - [Cinderella] Syreena. - Oh, Mama, I came looking for you, Mama. - Cross got you, too. I been watching that man for years. I knew he was too much the black peoples' friend. He just kept getting richer and we kept getting poorer. The runaway mothers scam led me down to the Cross Foundation. I got down there and went to peeking around, that man hates black people. All you gotta do is just look at him. - He used the mothers to carry the clone babies, right? - Drugged them, implanted the cell, then held them captive in the home, but Lixie escaped and I took her to a good doctor. - That'd really piss him off. - Watch your language Syreena. - I ought to burn this place down. - No! Lord, no. Do you realize that Cross has nearly perfected an artificial womb? That could be the answer to all our problems. Transplant unwanted births. - I need to get me a shotgun and rip... - Child, come here. Come here, honey. Ain't you learned nothing from all them hippie children that got their heads beat in from the dead Panther. - Yeah, I learned that you beat them before they beat you, Mama. That's what I learned. - You gonna go on fighting forever like that, you ain't never gonna win. The enemy's in our heads. - Now, I feel that we should go and get them. - Hold it, honey. I ain't got all night to talk, it's wisdom you're getting. - Yeah, but if we kick they asses- - Okay, kick their asses one more time, but let's do it right. Syreena, you're forgetting something. - For old time's sake. - Syreena, ain't you forgetting something? - [Philo] I got him Syreena, run! Run!
