"Not very consistent and invisible, he was defeated by Atlético de Madrid at the Vicente Calderón..." "Fancy meals, trips..." Without rendering any kind of justification "to the entity rescued with public money..." "The conditions of the second bailout" for Spain with Angela Merkel and the IMF, after more than two years applying "harsh cuts that have not been enough..." "We have a goal in the First Division. Goal, goal in the Rose Garden! Goal!" "The death of Carrasco." According to unofficial sources, they suggest that there was a bad relationship between them for reasons of jealousy, debts and unrequited favors. Laínz had been a party partner of Carrasco, in addition to working with her in the Diputación where, apparently, there was a labor and economic conflict, which could have... A local police officer is also "detected for his alleged collaboration." I think so. -No... Yes, don't worry, it's here on Friday. Come on, thanks. Goodbye. But what are you doing here at this hour? What's up? A friend who comes to congratulate you, or can't I? My God, Luis... Damn, Luis... Are you crazy? Damn, it's 10:00 in the morning. I bring you your birthday present. Ouch... But there will be someone you can talk to. Some zone or risk boss, or whatever the hell he's called now. Damn, Alberto, do I have to explain it to you again? This is not what it was, I enter the data and the computer tells me yes or no, and that's it. I can't do more. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. All my life paying religiously and now this. But how am I going to get into that mess? Let's see, it's not a mess, as you call it, it's real life. It's a fucking shame! Real life? Real life is that you're going to kill a viable company. Let's see, that's why, because it's viable, I'm playing it with you. Do you know how many people would dance if I offered it to them? You know that if it were up to me... Think about it and call me. Ouch... What? Did you like my gift? Fewer wolves, Little Red Riding Hood. "What the hell do you want me to do?" I've already told you that now I can't pay you, damn it. "This is not what we talked about." To take in the ass. Good. Damn, what I was missing. I can't pay you. And an egg. I need more time. I already told you that you have to pay me, I need the money now, damn it! But if they don't pay me, they won't renew my policies. What the hell do you want me to do? I don't give a damn what you have to do! You know? I'm not going to go around with bullshit, eh? There are methods. You'll see if you're going to pay me. Are you threatening me? Think what you want. You son of a bitch, you made millions on me and now you're threatening me, aren't you ashamed? Take a good look at what I'm saying, your fucking money is here tomorrow anyway, but I swear it's the last hard of mine what are you going to see in your fucking life! Come on. Did you hear me? I heard what I wanted to hear, that you're going to pay me. Tomorrow then, right? Yes, I said tomorrow. So you can get the hell out of here now! You better comply. Have you heard? Comply! Fuck... No, I'm not going to say. Is it that I do not put you? Give me a glass. a glass No, that's a surprise. Shall I put you on, Ana? Tell me tell me tell me I'm going to put them naked. Oh, naked? Yes. Can not be. Not... Honey, they're fine. When Paqui, Mrs. Paqui, see the models as God brought them into the world, and with a good necklace! Have they fallen asleep yet? Oh good. The next day she forces her husband to close the store for us and whatever it takes. Oh, please, oh, I pee! Alberto, it's okay now, right? What are you doing, Alberto? For the parades. But what... And fuck the houses... Ah! Albert! I'll call you now, I'll call you now. Alberto, Alberto. Alberto, are you...? Albert! Ana, Ana. Calm down. Yes... my God. Oh my God. What do you have, Ana, please? Easy, give him space. Please. Ana! What's up, Anne? Good, Mara, good... Alberto, look at me. Anna. Alberto, look at me, Alberto. "We need an ambulance, it's urgent." "Look at me, Alberto." "Well, I don't know, I don't know what it is, but it's urgent." Too bad, Ana. Easy. Let's do something, go, take a shower, relax for a bit and then come back. No Ana, I'm not leaving. But take advantage of it, it's my turn, Mara. Don't be silly, do as I say. Ana, I'm not leaving. Oh, how stubborn you are when you want to. Thank you. Yes? But what do you think, that you are going to laugh at me? I've been calling you all fucking day. Excuse me? "Where the hell are you?" Excuse me, but I think you're... "But who are you?" Pass me to Alberto, hosts! Look, my husband is in the hospital, so please calm down or I'll hang up, huh? Man, please. "What do you mean in the hospital?" Yeah, he's in the hospital. Unfortunately, he has suffered a stroke. And for now he won't be able to serve you, so whatever you have to deal with it, well he will have to wait. "Hello?" Uh, sorry, ma'am. How is Albert? The danger has passed, but we don't know the consequences yet. Yes. I really feel sorry for Alberto, but he said that he was going to pay me today and I am in a borderline situation, so we have to talk and see how we can find a solution. Well, as you can see, I can't fix anything, and I'm really sorry, but it will have to wait. "Well, I'm sorry, but I can't wait." Well then... "There has to be someone to give me a solution." Look, I already told you, when my husband is well, will charge what it has to charge. Damn. Fuck. Here it is, deed of empowerment in favor of Don Alberto García, granted by Doña María Antonia such and such. Look. You have to have the original. Let's see, Mara, although you haven't signed, you both guarantee and the loans are with a personal guarantee. But I didn't even remember. I would sign to speed up the procedures and all that, how could I... I could imagine such a thing, no... Already. And... And the store? Let's see, Mara, that's the personal guarantee, all present and future assets. The last thing the bank wants is precisely this, we are in real estate up to here. That's why we were looking for a solution with Alberto. Of course now with what has happened, I don't know. Give me some time, let's see what I can do. Are they already asleep? Shall we go to bed? I'm exhausted. Well, I'm scared with this. Come on, with what you've studied. Come on. Honey... You trust me, I'm sure that you are going to pass. But... And do you know why? Why? Because a little bird told me. Cheer up. See? The worst is over. Slowly, but it's going well. Change that face. I feel like smoking. Don't even think about it. Come on, handsome, you'll see that in a few days you'll be shooting, huh? Ana. Thank you. Come on, don't be silly, I'll spend a little while later. I have to go. But I just can't believe it. Is that we had already discussed this with Alberto. Well, the bank isn't interested in seizing anyway. You insist. Tell them if you want that we have advised you in the agency. Renew, Mara, renew, renew, for now you can't do anything else. Okay. And... And if not... what about my store? No, because I don't plan on losing her. Well, I don't know, girl, I understand you. But the truth is that it is not easy at all. It's impossible, I've already told you, without capitalization it's impossible. But... Let's see, Mara, you know the affection I have for Alberto. There may be solutions, but sometimes they are somewhat more complex. Alberto and I had it resolved, but of course, with what has happened... In short, you have to be very clear, do you understand me? No. I don't understand anything. Let's see, there are clients who have the opposite problem, who have money, but... Well, if you have any left over, give it to me, right? Let's see, María Antonia, it's a good solution. Come on, you have to do it right, you understand me. You can solve your things little by little and it's good for everyone. Alberto is already in the hospital, let's see if I'm going to finish it, you go who knows where. Let's see, they are serious people, with lawyers, all well done. You have Alberto's store and powers and these people understand that. I, for being you, you know, Alberto has thrown them back a bit, but I've talked to them. I don't see any other solution. Finally, think about it. What people? Damn, you remind me of an actor. I swear that with that face you're nailed to an actor. What the hell was the son of a bitch's name? Well, it doesn't matter, the case that they had given him in that movie, but well, eh? Look at you, same. Fuck. What was his name...? Mara, I've been calling you for two days. Me? And who are you? Genaro, the one from the sawmill. We talked the other day and Alberto had told me that... Yeah, what do you want me to tell you? You see what we have. I also have a very screwed up situation, but Alberto said that he was going to pay me. Yeah, I told him too I can't do anything and will have to wait, like everyone else. Well, I'm not going to wait, damn it, do you want to listen to me or not, damn it? Don't raise your voice to me, and if you don't want to wait, go to the courts. To the courts? So, very good. There, there, it goes. Go, go, go So. Yeah, I know. But what do you want, to finish here? You have to rest, Mara, you have to take care of yourself. But, but have you seen yourself? I'm fine. This. Thank you. I'm fine, really. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, I've been a little late, but I'm fine. And the children? Don't talk to me. Listen, I'm going to change. But then I'll come. Okay. Stop working, honey. Now the most important thing, the most important thing is that you get well. How can you be so... Sorry. Count it. You have to tell. Didn't we sign a document or anything... or anything like that? No need, tell it. There it is. Luis, we already agreed, no more guards. Yeah you're right, honey, but what do I do, huh? Do I end up like an asshole? I'm doing you a favor, I look like a good partner and it's approved and that's it, it's over. Mm? Come on, give me a kiss. But be careful. Yes. "Hey, this automatic pistol has 10 bullets." Oops. Do not move... "One more step and I'll pull the trigger." I can't believe it. What are you doing here? And in uniform. Why don't you pick up the phone for me? Do you know what day I spent today? Can I pass or not? Yeah, sure, come on in. Luis, no... Yes... No, Luis, please. Yes. Not today, please. Yes... No, Luis. Luis, Luis. Luis. For, for, for. Fuck, fuck, I needed it. I needed it... And you wanted to miss it. And you didn't want to miss it either, huh? Fucking son of a bitch. But who is it? Shut up... Hush... But who the hell is this guy? A creditor of Alberto. These are not hours, so please go away. I already told you it's not hours, so if you don't leave me alone, I'm going to call the police. "I just want to talk." Very well, we'll talk tomorrow. "Are you sure?" Of course I'm sure, we'll talk tomorrow. "As you wish, ma'am." But who the hell is this guy? I already told you, he is a creditor. Like a creditor? A creditor, yes, Luis, we are broke, like everyone else. What? Holy shit! What? Luis, Luis, Luis, Luis! Fuck! Luis... Ah! Fuck... Get out of here right now. Calm down, friend, calm down. Chill chill. I said go, dammit. Let's see, ma'am, tell your friend to calm down. If all I want is for us to talk, damn it. I don't have any money... Damn. Call the police, Mara. Call! No, no, we're leaving, we're leaving. But you're wrong, ma'am. You. You are wrong. Ah! Yes, sir, yes, sir. Well, hell, I didn't know she was going to be accompanied. Well, hero, calm down, right? Come on, let's see if we understand each other. Come on. I'm going for ice. Can I? Come on. How do I tell him I don't have any money? Don't take me for an asshole, ma'am. Alberto said that he paid me, so he better stop fooling around and pay me. And who the hell are you with a gun? Kevin Costner? The bodyguard? Damn the lady, now I feel sorry for Alberto. Are you going to tell me why you have a gun, or would you rather I ask my friend, Kevin Costner? Why do you have a gun? I'm a police officer. Whoops! Local. He has fucked her. Fuck the lady, couldn't you fuck a normal guy? I shit on my father... Go put your pants on, man. Come on. Policeman... Touch your balls... I shit on... I swear I don't have the money, but as soon as we can I'll pay you first. Do you think I'm an asshole? No. I have tried to fix it for good. And now that? And above police. Yes you're right, but... put yourself in my shoes, what could I do with Alberto in the hospital? Let's do something, tomorrow morning we go to the bank and do whatever it takes. No, I already see what he does. He's not going to say anything, as you understand. Shut up, damn it. Alberto told me that he had the money and you know it. My God... Let's see, nothing has happened yet, they had better leave now before something bad happens and that's it, all forgotten. Then they fix their stuff for good... Shut up, Kevin, sit down. Damn, nobody here has to smoke? Look at these two. What are you doing? A cigarette, hosts. You're still in time to quit. What are you going to do, kill us for shit? We can talk, right? Can we talk? How much is he going to pay you? Tell me, damn, how much is he going to pay you, we can pay you double, double for doing nothing. You haven't... You son of a bitch! On top...! Okay, okay, okay. Whoops, damn. Ma'am, let's see if we make things clear. I only came with the intention of scaring her, so that she would take it seriously, because they're not going to mess with the courts or shit like that. In agreement? And come on, now we're going to look for the money, because since she doesn't tell me where she is, I'll destroy her house looking for it. But he's crazy... How do I tell him I don't have the money? Call me crazy again... Ah! I cut you, whore. Uh... And now let's see where you want us to start. - No. - How not, hosts? A long time. Who can die first? Don't go too far, dude. And if you prefer, give me my thousands and I'll do this. But, then, what do we do, dammit? Come. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? Make up your mind, geez. No. What do you prefer, the police finger or your finger? Please let him please. Please! What do you prefer? No, he has nothing to do with it, please leave him alone, he has nothing to do with it... Ah! Tell him, cunt. No, please! Do you decide anything? Please. No. Ah! Oh, oh, oh... Ah! Son of a bitch! Be still! Son of a bitch! Be still! Son of a bitch! Feel! Motherfuckers! Quiet! Sons of bitches... Stand still... You sons of bitches... Son of a bitch! Stay! Quiet. Out. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Out. Don't do anything stupid! Out! Come on, get out! Don't do crazy. Fuck. My God, what the hell happened? Where's the other son of a bitch? Oh my God... I shit on... Damn I think he's dead. He is not dead. Call an ambulance. The Police... Call the Police. To the Police. To the Police. What are you doing? Call 112. But what the fuck do you want, ruin my life? He's fucking dying. I know, damn it, wait! Wait, dammit! Fuck! No matter what, it was me. Do you have the money? But you think if I had the money... Ok, sorry. I don't know, I don't know what the hell Alberto was going to do. Mara, I'm really sorry, listen to me. We have to trust each other, huh? Trust... Be careful. Yes. Sorry. Ah. Fuck. Be careful. Wait. Wait. I can't believe it. "Hi, honey." How are you? I just couldn't sleep. Where are you? Hey, I can't talk to you right now. Oh, okay, okay. No, don't worry. A kiss. I'll call you later. "A kiss." I love you. "Me too." Can I get you a sweater or something? Fuck yes. That's it. That's it... The door... Okay... Come on. Fuck you fucking shit! Put it in again, put it in! Close this too. And where is that son of a bitch? I have your phone. Murderess! You're crazy, motherfucker! "You're going to shit yourself!" Wait. Help me. Holy fucking... No, not like this, push it towards me. There. There. A little more. Champagne? Has the Bull arrived? "The mobile he is calling is turned off or out of coverage right now." I can't. I tell you I can't and I can't, Luis. This is crazy, not here. We can't leave it here, please. He's going to give me something. I don't know what the hell I listened to you for. Calm down, dammit, it's temporary, I'll figure something out. We should have warned you, Luis. You could fucking understand, they were at my house. I told you, I told you, "Call the Police." I told you. Call the Police? It's very easy for you, I'm the Police. What is easy for me? Do you think that for me it's easy? Yes, that's what I think. I have a family, what do I tell them? Huh? Tell me, what do I tell them? Fuck it, right? God. So far it's the best. That was my mistake. I've always said yes. Oh, how late, isn't it? Yes. Cari, if I go to the ER, I have to report and I'm like an asshole. Be careful. What a fix. The one at the gas station. Ah... Watches are over. Promise me. Yes. "Lady Lady". Well, ma'am, this is it. Very good. Working, okay? Perfect. Perfect. Here, ma'am. Mrs. Yes. The keys. Yes, yes. Come on, grab it, grab it already. Hasn't passed the night and not a message or anything? Any. Damn, Luis, I've been calling you all morning. Calm down, will you? "How do you want me to calm down? My heart was coming out of my mouth, it was at my door." Who? Like who? Who will it be? The other. Who will it be? He will not do anything, not even report, I would have already done it. No, Luis. No, Luis, he's going to do something, I feel it, he's going to do it. "I'm going to call it and fix it anyway." Don't even think about it, wait. I'll find out a couple of things and get back to you. Luis, I'm going to call you. Mara, please listen to me. An hour and I'll call you. "Okay." Okay, but please call me. Please. Sorry, but no. Let's see, you have to enter the money and cover the overdrafts. That was what we talked about. Yeah, but I don't trust it. No, I need to make sure that I'm not going to lose the store and I don't care how it's done, I don't care. How do you not trust? Well, I don't trust you and until I trust, I won't join. But do you know what you're messing with? The short one with the mean face? Fuck. OK OK. Yes? Yes? It doesn't matter. Until two. A kiss. It was Mara. Leave that, if there is almost nothing today. Well, that's how I stretch my legs. Fuck, Luis. It's just been the whole day. Yeah, I don't know what to do. Yes, yes, of course. Yes. And what time? Very good. Yes, yes, OK. In agreement. Good. Fuck... Mm... I swear I don't know the policeman, damn it. What a fagot, and what do I do with you? Why the hell don't you tell me? What do I say now to his wife? That a fagot has left him lying? No, no... No, damn it. No no no. No, no, no! Oh! Nope! Oh no! Nope! Do the exercises. Come on, cheer up. Are we waiting for you? No, I don't think so. Luis is with the exams and... and I have things to do. Take care. Let's see, I can't do anything anymore, of course the business belonged to your son, but... The guarantee was yours. One moment. Hello Fran. This afternoon? Is that... Yes, yes, okay. I will be there. Ok, Fran. You're home now. Huh? And I'll come as soon as possible. That they are two very good clients and I don't want to lose them. We'll talk later, I'm late. Okay. Take. Ouch. Do you see it? Come on, Alberto, I'll help you later, okay? Yes? Bye sweetheart. I'm leaving now. Hello? Let's see, try to figure it out. You do not know what are you doing. I know exactly what I'm doing. I want to see Albert. No, Alberto is not for visitors. How much have you got? 5000. And do you think that will be enough? It's not what I think, it's what I have. Well let's go. Is here. Tell him to come in and close the door. Sit down. Have a drink. -I'm on duty. Who the hell is it? The one with the ball. Give me the envelope. Mara, fuck, listen to me. He's stung with you and with me you know it's in your best interest to reach an agreement. Listen to me, dammit. Hey! Hey, is there anyone? Hello? Hello. Hey. Hey, hey... No, no. Shit on... Ah! oh! Ah! That's it. How is that done? I told you it's over, well it's over. Convince her, Alberto. One week, more I can't. Take care of yourself. Hello. Hello? And the children? With my mother. What's up? What's up, Ana? Mara. What about Mara? That's what I say. What about Mara? I don't know, you tell me. Shut up... But what are you doing? You son of a bitch, I'll tell you that! But do you think I'm an idiot? Yes, poor Mara, look at her situation. You're wrong, honey. You sure are wrong. You son of a bitch! But do you think I suck my thumb, Luis? Do you really believe it? If you calm down, I'll tell you. Ana. You have two sons, you son of a bitch, two, two! Ana... Ana. Oh my god, my god, if you're looking at it, you're looking at it, you're looking at it. Think about it. These are your things, Ana, they are your things that... Don't be silly, you're seeing it, you're seeing it. Ana, listen to me please. You're looking at it! Listen to me please, listen to me please. I was helping him with a problem with Alberto, do you understand? Calm down darling, please listen to me and don't think anything weird. Alberto owed money to an uncle and Mara... She, lost and helpless, I call to you, and you, with your white horse... Of course. Seriously, dammit. Go away, go away, Luis. Ana. Go away. We'll... we'll fix what we have to fix. Would you let me tell you, dammit? Go away! I said go away! Look, you disgust me right now. I don't want to see you. Louis... Go away! Go away! Go away... Okay, I'm leaving. We'll talk when you calm down. Please... Hello. I'm already home. How are you? I'm sorry, honey, I'm sorry, but I already told you that they were two very careful heavy. But may I know what's wrong with you? I told you I'm sorry. What? What? Okay... Here, honey. Okay, that's it, that's it. Alberto, I was going to tell you, I swear. I was going to tell you, but... But I can't tell you anymore. Listen to me. Alberto, let me tell you. Listen to me, please. It was nothing, nonsense. Please listen to me. She was scared. I didn't know what to do, I thought it was what you were going to do. Alberto, please, please. It's also your fault, you know? It's your fault for having me fooled, what did you think? Huh? What did you think, that I was stupid and you can't tell me the truth? Is that what you thought? Damn. No, no, no, it's just that you can't fail, no, you can't fail. Why so proud, Alberto? Why huh? I'm your fucking wife. I'm your wife and not an ornament from the store, dammit. Alberto, please. Please I beg you, look. She was scared, she was scared a lot, you know? Tell me what to do. Tell me what to do, without a house, without a job, without... Nothing at all, Alberto. Even as we are, tell me what to do. Tell me what to do... I shit on... Here it is, there you have it. We have to think very carefully about what we have to do, you know? We have to think about it very well. We have to think about it very well. Let's go to the field. Let's go to the field, yes. What's the name of the one in that store, the carpenter's? - Do you mean Maria Antonia? - Yeah, fuck. But how? Kill, Mala? What the hell do they call it? Ah, well, Mara, everyone calls her Mara. That's right, Mary. What about this fucking Mara? Don't worry, really, there won't be any problem. Her husband is already out, we have talked and there is no problem. What the hell are you talking about? - I don't know, you asked me about Mara. - Well that, that you talk to me about the Mara of the balls. And what the hell have you talked to her husband? The delay in entering the money. How? The whore who gave birth to Mara de la cojones. He doesn't pick it up. Come on, let's go. Shall we have dinner? Damn, who is that? Mara, his friend. And you, turn that off. To the parrot, huh? To the parrot. Who is it? "It's me, Mara, I need to talk to you." Couldn't wait? Good evening, excuse me. I warned you, Mary. Close there. I don't have the money here. What are you feeling, damn. She goes fagot. Now I don't know where to start. Look, I just wanted the box to guarantee me that she did not lose the store. It makes sense, right? You used to go to the club. You liked Lucy. Good girl Lucy, huh? We don't have girls like them anymore. Now they're... well, you know, foreigners. They're fucking crazy, right? But for you it's not the same. Do not listen. Well, tell me, tell me what you want us to do, please. What am I going to tell you? They go to what they go, they are very cold, man. In the end, Lucy left with a truck driver from Bilbao who looked like Patrick Swayze. And he sucks at it, I think. Good girl Lucy. Too bad, you were wrong there. Well, to the point, I have no fucking idea how we're going to get out of this. What was your name? Alberto, his name is Alberto, and if you don't mind, if you don't mind we'll set the record straight, I'm the one with the money. That's it, Alberto, dammit. Of course. I had you for good clients. What times, huh? Come works and pasta running. But that's over. Some lost, like the sawmill. Bad colleague, Alberto. Racano, treacherous, bad people. You didn't know anything about that either? I don't know what you mean. Try not to play innocent with me. I don't like to repeat things twice. And I told you that... I told you not to play innocent with me! Please... Please. Fran, I think there is no need to... That there is no need for what? Tell me. As she has said that she has the money and she is willing to… she Is she willing to what? Don't open your mouth again until I tell you to, okay? There still and quiet. She is right. I shit on my fucking life! Look, your friend had a hard time, but he has sung, you know? I don't know what you're talking about. I told you, you were wrong, Lucy was something else. Don't you know what I mean? No. I mean the one you and that policeman you're fucking, you son of a bitch. Bury him like a vermin... You are going to remove it with your nails, for my dead. Open up, motherfucker. You, go back! You there, there still, huh? There quiet. Open up, damn it! Let's go! Yes... ah. Ah... You... Damn, throw the fucking cigarette away and bring it over here. Ah... Albert! Holy shit... Please Albert. What are you doing? Please Alberto, I was just trying to help. Don't do crazy. There's one outside. I can help you, Alberto. I've done all I can. You have that money. Leave it, Alberto, please. I'm telling you there's another one outside. What could I do? What else could I do? Damn... Holy crap. Salt... No, no! Ah... Do it... Do it... Do it. No, no, no! No! No, no, no! No!
