We're ill, our children are often ill. And we wanted Shaman Shirumkama to bless us, and to relieve our ailments by exorcizing the evil spirit. We wanted to be cleansed from our sins with incense. We're in transit with our herd right now. We live nomadic lives and raise our own cattle. We also wanted to know what direction we should proceed in. Whether we should move at all. Shirumkama said we could go in any direction, and that is very good. Do you think the shaman's visit and his blessings will help you along? Yes, he's a very good man. We're here to be blessed and cleansed. And we met you here. I believe we will get well and your film will work out well too. Mother of the world, my dear sisters. With woeful heart, I turn to you, yet I bring you joyous news. Mother Nature is suffering due to mankind's actions. Children are dying due to their elders' stupidity and barren souls. Doomsday is approaching earth. Yet our Saviour has come. He who brought truth, light and love. He has come as He promised 2,000 years ago, quietly and secretly, like a thief in the night. Endless numbers of people flock around Him. And within a year His message spread across the entire land like a wildfire. From Magadan to Riga, from Arkhangelsk to Tiflis. So heareth this joyous message. Our Saviour has come and will light the way to salvation. Full of hope and faith your children look upon you. Venture not from the path of love, light and truth. Believe me, a mother of four, and join Him and you will save your children and Mother Earth, who is suffering due to our lack of compassion. My dear children of God, the earth is your only mother. Dumb and ridiculous are the sons of the same mother who inhabit the same house but live separately, because one son was born in one place, and the other son was born in another place. Great foolishness has befallen mankind. Forget not that one people striving to put itself above another people is the sign of an afflicted spirit. And forget not the Word of God, "He who praises himself shall be humbled." Great sorrow marks the face of our heavenly Father as he observes our madness, in particular that of the faithful. How much has been written about faith already? How many clever philosophies put forth? Yet, because man is stubborn, up until today no one has understood that all these great writings will lead only to two phrases: "Love God" and "love thy neighbour". But where is this love? The time has now come for the word of our glorious God to reach your ears anew. But it is up to you to listen to His word. Lest not Isaiah's prophecy be fulfilled again. It persistently declared, and still reads, "You shall hear with your ears, but not understand. You shall see with your eyes, but not recognize." For their hearts have become hard. They rarely listen with their ears, and their eyes are closed. Be wise, for mankind is heading straight towards the abyss. But mankind has reached that place where the only path leading from this ill-fated road is the path to true perfection. I have little to tell about myself. I can only say that I am the Word of God, and I and God are one. Above all, a time of conflict awaits you. For the freedom of choice, which God gave you, is in fact true freedom. You shall in no way violate it. So listen to your hearts and make a choice. Go on the quest. I ask the mother to leave the church while the child is dipped in the basin. Please remain outside. We will come and get you. Try to focus your attention on the palms of your hands. Just as you do when there's a bad telephone connection. At first you hear nothing and then you're all ears. I will first explain what you are to do with this picture. You can use it to energetically charge water and salve. As much as you deem necessary. You will never lack positively energized water or salve. Let yourselves be reminded of the anxiety of solitude. Let yourselves be reminded, cry refreshing and soothing tears. I remind you to recall death and sickness, and your misfortune. I, Russia's magician command you to open your bosoms, like the doors of hell. We haven't seen each other in a whole month. Seems like an eternity. You know, I very often see you in my dreams. Especially lately. Our eldest daughter came home one day and said, "Mum, I met a strange person. Here in Minusinsk, there's a Jesus." When I first heard him preach I experienced such a feeling of joy. It was as if my soul was lifted to the heavens. It was a feeling of immense warmth and goodness. It is not written that the heavens will open and Christ will appear, but that he will come quietly and silently, very silently. He will come to those who long for Him. And so it happened that he came to us. That is why the scriptures tell us to "be heedful of your hearts". For many false prophets will come, wolves in sheep's clothing. Clothe a wolf in sheep's fur, and nothing good will come of it. It will always smell of wolf. You will always sense it. But you will only be able to see it with your heart. I dreamt of a cloud floating down from the heavens into my room. He's standing on the cloud and I ask Him, "Have you come?" He smiles and says, "Everything will be fine. I will come. Not now, but rather a little later." I used to work as a film projectionist. I now toll bells. I was raised in an orphanage. Aged two, I was put in an orphanage for small children. Then I was sent to one for school-aged children. Today, it brings me joy that my work makes people happy. The people need the sound of the bells. My name is Yuri Yuryevich Yuryev. The carers at the first orphanage said I gave myself this name. When I was brought to the orphanage as a little boy and they asked what my name was, I responded to both surname and family name with Yura. So they called me "the three Ys". My parents' whereabouts have preoccupied me all my life. I don't know who they are, and I don't know who I am. I would give anything in the world to find them. I was born in 1944, when the war was still being waged. The war or Stalinist repression is perhaps the reason why I lost my parents. I have had no success in finding them. My passport has only the date and place of my birth, the town of Murom. Persons who might be my parents are not listed. There were three cloisters, Feast of the Elevation of the Cross, of the Assumption, and of Corpus Christi. When the Tartars returned, they found only three hills and a lake. And the divers didn't hit bottom. Pike were let loose, but they swam into the next river out of fear, for the lake was bottomless. Underneath the ground, there seems to only be water. Insight into the Russian soul can be gained in the town of Kitezh. Here we have Lake Svetloyar. The great town of Kitezh once stood above it. The soldiers of the Mongol, Batu Kahn, drew near, and the inhabitants begged God to protect and spare their city. God answered their prayers. The earth opened up and the city sank. And in its place a lake formed. Today, people visit this place. They believe the town of Kitezh really exists. It does exist, according to belief. They pilgrim there and crawl around the Lake. And this will go on forever. This is what forms the Russian character and soul. Such is the nature of the Russian mind, that it has a longing to one day see the invisible town of Kitezh. This hill is called the seventh hill of Jerusalem. When the pilgrims came to spend the night the hill under them split open at midnight, and a cathedral appeared. In the cathedral, many young boys stood holding candles. And a choir was singing. The psalm reader kept still and asked what kind of a cathedral it was. It is dedicated to the 14,000 children murdered in Jerusalem. That's how it went. After a while, the crevice in the hill closed. I once saw the following at a priestess' home. There was a large table in the hall. I walked out into the courtyard. There was a huge ox under the table. Flames blazed from his nostrils and he farted flames. And his tongue was fiery red. I knocked on the door. The priestess came outside and said a prayer. As soon as she finished it, the monster vanished through the cat flap. I told her everything was probably okay now. But she replied, "Sonya, we're now doomed. A demon is among us." I thought the roof would collapse. We were afraid to light the hearth, because we thought the house would cave in. I saw this miracle with my own eyes. I saw this evil spirit. That was a miracle if there ever was one. This stump belonged to a pine tree that was felled by a man. He had hardly started when he suddenly went blind. He was brought home, where he lay down ill, and then choked to death. Trees may not be felled here, nor desecrated in any way. We come here to pray, and God blesses us with a cure. We now know that this stump is valuable and that it heals. Oh Lord, heal us. Father, great tree stump, which has been here so long, heal us. Oh Lord, heal our arms and legs. Well, I'll continue to crawl now. What's wrong with my hand? My pig went wild, ran out of the stall, began to foam at the mouth, and attacked the cow. I was afraid. Because a pig has bitten through a cow's throat before. I picked up a stick and ran towards the pig, "My God, what is wrong with you? Get out, get out!" The pig turned around. I held the stick in one hand, and it bit me in the other. I ran backwards into the house and fell on the floor. The door behind me closed just in time. The pig sprang onto the doorpost and began to gnaw at it to get into the house. I was bleeding profusely. I was able to get the pig in the barn. And I ran to hospital where I was given a shot. Maria Pavlovna, have you seen any aliens here? I have! I have! I once went for a walk around the lake. I was afraid of the dark and didn't want to walk any further. Then suddenly, I heard someone singing. A sense of great joy came over me, and I thought, "Maybe I'm not here alone after all." I kept walking around the lake. At once I saw about eleven people with candles in their hands. I crossed myself and followed them all around the lake. They stopped to pray now and then. I stopped at that same place and prayed too. I then caught up with them. I stayed near them and listened to them sing. When we arrived at the hills, I began to ask myself once again how I would get home. I thought, "Look at their faces, perhaps someone is from Vladimirskoye." Suddenly, as I came near them, they disappeared into thin air. The only thing that remained was the scent of extinguished candlewicks. I suddenly heard a toll and felt a strong vibration, as if I were standing on a bell tower. I was surprised, because there aren't any bells here. Where's the sound from? It keeps getting louder. My legs vibrated and even the ground began to tremble. At first, it was the sound of a single giant bell from the deep. Then small bells began to chime too. And then a choir began to sing the Cherubim Hymn. Furthermore, I will give your ripe hearts my blessing, to those who are able to hear the glorious word. I will give you strength. Be ready to accept. But listen to your heart. Since from then on, having received the Word of God, you will divide each other into the power of light and darkness, already in the course of this year. Separating the wheat from the chaff. The harvesting will then begin, so listen to your hearts. There won't be many. Your minds will wander. Listen to your hearts, for it is only one blind man today, who will not get to see God's gift. Receive the glorious blessing of God. May you be blessed. May your tongues speak of love. And may your hands bear love. May peace, happiness and love be with you. Amen.
