(faint ambient sounds) (faint sound of children playing) How many of you, put, have family or close friends with cancer or have experienced cancer. Put up your hands. What about diabetes? How about infertility? Family or close friends. Now I want those of you who put your hand up at least once to put it up again, for any of those questions, and look around you. (music) today every third person develops cancer. Who will it be? (Obama) Because if we want to protect Americans from Ebola here at home, we have to end it over there. H1N1, SARS, MERS Universal health coverage is the single most powerful concept that public health has to offer. We will not let the people down. (radio static) (radio static) But after Fukushima, I think, you can see that everyone knows that there's a kind of official and high level cover up and the WHO is involved in it. The WHO's been criticised for reacting too slowly to the outbreak, do you think any of that criticism is fair? They don't have the money, they don't have the capacity, they don't have the leadership, they don't have the courage to say 'let's go'. I'm a filmmaker, I have a daughter, it is important to me that she finds the world in good condition. That is why I'm travelling to the WHO headquarters in Geneva. The American journalist Robert Parsons lives here. For 20 years now he's been writing about the WHO. Until a few years ago, every Monday, the opening day of the World Health Assembly there was a sumptuous reception at the WHO given by the Director General that was the great centrepiece where everybody met and talked. It was a very good situation for pulling everybody together in an informal setting. (music) Now, more than ever, that sort of thing has been replaced by a private reception. And they are organised by industry. I'm particularly pleased to have two ministers of health. And the industry spends a lot of money, for them it's just part of the cost of doing business. It's a way of making direct contact with the people who back in their home countries are making decisions to formulate and implement public health policy. It's extraordinarily expensive, you can imagine it, if you have 1,000 people and you give 100 francs a person it's 100,000 francs right there at least, just to feed people who are already over-fed. There's no limit on the champagne or the wine and it's always very good wine. Straight through if you can. No you can't. (narrator) What a promising start. But originally it must have been about more. The suffering of millions of human beings in scores of countries will be alleviated and many, many thousands of lives will be saved. (applause) WHO has positively changed everything. Smallpox was completely eradicated which was the first time ever that a disease was wiped out. The world saves each year 1000 million dollars on vaccines and care of the sick alone. According to Robert Parsons, the WHO is infiltrated by the industry from the very start. Here. This one's in English. This is in the San Francisco examiner. Anyway, WHO was not happy with my coverage because it made them look less than good. (music) Ever since the 1950s, studies have shown that smoking damages health. But for decades the WHO does little to oppose the tobacco industry. (music) How often does your job call you out of bed in the middle of the night. Well if you were a doctor it would be often and generally there isn't much time to spare. Coffee doctor? Oh fine! Have a Camel with your coffee Thanks. You know, this night work's kind of rough isn't it. That's right, but a Camel's always a pleasure. The majority of politicians take no action against tobacco advertising for decades. Nothing is done to check the profits of the tobacco industry until charges are brought against it by its victims and the USA. As late as 1994, heads of the tobacco industry testified before the American congress. Do you believe that nicotine is not addictive? I believe that nicotine is not addictive. I believe that nicotine is not addictive. I believe that nicotine is not addictive. The real issue is: Should cigarettes be outlawed. Gradually the tobacco companies are obliged to publish their internal documents. These general requests are getting very broad. No that's not broad at all Mr. Campbell. Will you provide that information to the committee? We're extremely concerned about competitive activity... Yes or no Mr. Campbell? I will do my best, yes. Their strategies to combat the WHO are made public. One example is the Boca Raton action plan from the year 1988. Senior figures at Philip Morris met in Florida and drew up a number of sophisticated strategies to limit the power of the WHO. The first and most important aim. This organisation has extraordinary influence on government and consumers and we must find a way to diffuse this. The WHO gets under pressure. (speaking French) The evidence show that tobacco companies had operated for many years with the deliberate purpose of subverting the efforts of WHO to control tobacco. (music) (applause) One of these institutes is lead by the American lawyer Paul Dietrich. Philip Morris finances it with $240,000 a year. At the same time Dietrich is a consultant for the WHO regional office in America. When his double role becomes known, Dietrich moves into the finance industry. And we bought back our own bonds, that money never went back into the economy! He won't agree to talk to me. And the WHO report on the strategies of the tobacco industry, 6 other consultants are mentioned. The British toxicologist Frank Sullivan for instance, claims that passive smoking doesn't harm your health. His study on the subject is financed by Philip Morris. Hello, Frank Sullivan. Hello Mr Sullivan, oh (awkward laughter) Good to hear you. I tell you why I'm calling you. I came across the tobacco scandal at WHO and there your name is mentioned. (Sullivan) My name?! Yes. Oh I didn't know that. (narrator) Were you a WHO consultant? Yes I'm an (awkward stutter) Yeah, I am I, I, I'm a consultant for WHO, and I also used to be a consultant in the tobacco industry. There was a great long form you had to fill in every time I went to a meeting at WHO. (narrator) But did you declare in those forms that you also consulted tobacco industry? Yes, yes, yes. And it was no problem for WHO? No, no, no because (laughing) it wasn't a big issue. From when till when were where you a WHO consultant. Oh, I don't know when. Did you stop after the tobacco scandal or not? No, no, no. (music) In the year 2000, Sullivan's collaboration with the tobacco industry becomes public, but he still continues to advise the WHO. I meet with two department leaders combating tobacco under the auspices of the WHO. We have a zero tolerance approach as I said the Director General says, the tobacco industry is our number 1 enemy and we wear that badge very proudly. (narrator) Is Frank Sullivan still a WHO consultant. Absolutely not I mean... They can't because the names of all those persons are well known through the documents. But did Frank Sullivan consult to WHO in for example 2002 let's say? Not that I'm aware of as well too, and again the policies that are in place now is that all consultants no matter whether they're working in tobacco control or infectious diseases or anywhere in the organisation, have to sign a declaration of interest. (narrator) But this means a lot of trust. Don't you think they should be reviewed? Trust I think that you should trust until such a day you lack trust. You cannot just start by already being suspicious about people and their capacity to do things. That's good. Thank you so much. We are not alone during the conversation, three WHO staff are watching us and the press spokesman conducts the person I'm interviewing with silent gestures. I would like to know about conflict of interest forms and I would like to see the conflict of interest forms of Frank Sullivan. I just am able to refer the question on to the necessary people because that might be in the archive of the organisation but in the role of the reference library and that's what we do. My official enquiry about Frank Sullivan's conflict of interest form is a dead end despite countless phone calls. (music) The WHO and also Thomas Zeltner they always say ok we had a problem and there was single persons who were corrupt. This was Sullivan, Paul Dietrich and so on. But I'm always doubting was it really single persons and now it's over or could you say that entire segments of WHO are corrupt? We have all the tobacco company documents which show how major corporations operate. And the pharmaceutical companies or the chemical companies do not operate any differently. Their obligation to their shareholders completely overwhelms any consideration of public health. So these are the people that are involved in the H1N1 push. (tense music) Swine flu, or H1N1, is presented by the WHO and in the public media as a huge threat. Wrongly as it later emerges. (newsreader) We are in the earliest days of the pandemic) (news reports playing over each other) Do you remember swine flu? You were really frightened. The numbers are staggering. Well first of all, they are estimated by the WHO to affect 2bn people worldwide with H1N1. Joining us now from Cibolo, Texas, Patrick and Robyn Henshaw. Their family has been hit hard by this Swine flu, good morning to you both. Good morning. My administration's taken several precautions to address the challenge posed by the 2009 H1N1 flu virus. If you've been diagnosed with probable or presumed 2009 H1N1 or Swine flu in recent months, you may be surprised to know this. The odds are you didn't have H1N1 flu. In fact you probably didn't have flu at all. WHO is very happy to be taking part in this hearing... (several people speaking at the same time) But I've heard no reason why. Many countries including Germany, Italy, France and Great Britain concluded secret agreements with pharmaceutical companies before the Swine flu incident, which obliged them to purchase Swine flu vaccinations. But only if the WHO issued a pandemic level 6 alert. (music) The world is now at the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic. Swine flu makes considerable profits for the manufacturers of vaccines. In first quarter net profit, saving its Swine flu vaccine, Lantes, for the gains. France's largest drug maker said it's net profit in the quarter rose to 1.71bn euros, that's 2.26bn US dollars. I tried to arrange an interview with the person responsible for Swine flu at the WHO, Keiji Fukuda, he was often on television at the time. But I get an appointment with the official press spokesman. 11 countries, officially reporting 331 cases of influenza A H1N1 infection, with 10 deaths. Were you aware of the contracts between pharmaceutical companies and governments? You have to be aware of this. Of course, you have to be aware of everything that's going on. And it is extremely easy to after the fact say, well maybe X should not have done Y, and A should not have done B. However, think about the opposite. What would have happened if the influenza killed 50 percent of the people infected and there was no vaccine. Then you and others would be standing here today getting really mad at us for not having made vaccine a possibility. Now in terms of an overall assessment of the severity of what we are seeing, it's probably fair to call the situation something like moderate. At the time I am pregnant and I avoid airports, crowds and all forms of travel. Public media exaggerates with words and images, the danger resulting from swine flu. (music and ambulance siren) Could they have declared the pandemic level 6 also with the old definition? So this is er... This was removed before 2009, shortly before H1N1. Of course, we would like to have a vaccine tomorrow. We would have wanted to have had it yesterday. In 2009, Miss Kieny is a member of the WHO Swine flu working group. Previously she had worked for the French pharmaceutical company Transgene. The press spokesman doesn't allow me to interview her, so I try to approach her directly at a conference. I ask Miss Kieny why the criteria of severity was deleted from the definition of a pandemic phase. (music) The WHO working group on Swine flu consists of 13 external consultants. Two of them report conflicts of interest. Neil Ferguson declares consultancy fees from GlaxoSmithKline, Baxter and Roche, the manufacturers of the swine flu vaccines and medications. Not a problem for the WHO. In 2007, Albert Osterhaus loses his voting right on the Dutch heath commission due to his conflicts of interest. He declares to the WHO that he has shares in the pharma company Viroclinics, which is suspected of profiting from Swine flu. He also declares that he is the chairman of ESWI, describing it as a group of independent scientists. In fact it is partly financed by vaccine manufacturers. Because I also did some research about H1N1, could we also discuss this a little bit later? Yeah? I can tell you there's no scientific meeting today organised that is not being sponsored by industry and rightly so. Industry is making the vaccines, it's not the national institutes that are making the vaccines any longer, industry is doing it. (narrator) I'm very curious, are you still a WHO consultant? At the moment I'm working more with the private sector as well so I'm still consulting from time to time. (narrator) Are you still working with this European Scientists against Influenza? Yes, I'm the chair of that particular organisation. (narrator) Because I saw that you declared this as a conflict of interest. No no it's not a conflict of interest but I declare also what might be perceived as a conflict of interest. No but you have to be very careful there so at least if you say that, people can hold it against you yeah but at least I can always say and I have always done that. At least you show what you do. (narrator) It was written there 'independent group of scientists', when I looked on the website I saw it's funded by all the vaccine producers. No no it's not funded by, some money comes from vaccine producers but there's money coming from many other sources as well and that's the same with WHO and a lot of other organisations. As long as you're transparent and show what you're doing, it's fine I think. (narrator) How is the percentage of funding? I don't know exactly, but there is a substantial part of the funding comes from elsewhere. From meetings, comes from European projects, and there is a percentage coming from industry as well and that's completely transparent. It's fine to bring it up again but for me it's over. I don't get any hard figures from Mr. Osterhaus either. Without any facts, without transparency, I can't make any progress here. What about the WHO? We didn't say anything - No, no No, I wouldn't like you to use what I just said but I'm happy to say something else. Please don't approach people with a camera. We have issues, please don't do that. I ask and then it's fine? If you ask and you set up the interview, that's ok. At the country level, I hear good news and I hear bad news about engagement with non state actors. We found out that there has been a big lack of transparency with the pandemic alert experienced in 2009. What did you do since then to have more transparency concerning the decisions done, concerning the staff, concerning the declarations of conflicts of interest. How do you want to improve this? I want to erm... agree with you. There is no replacement of transparency and accountability. And that's the only way to hold people to account. But in order to do that, we must recognise that in this 21st century, no government can provide everything to their people. So you do need to work with the industry. But work in a way that there is no room for conflict of interest. (road noise and music) In the case of the pharmaceutical industry, it's even more difficult for the WHO to maintain it's independence than with the tobacco industry. On the one hand the WHO is dependent on the pharmaceutical industries for research and medication. But the industries financial interests mustn't damage the WHO's activities in the area of health. One thing is clear, today the pharmaceutical industry is part of the health system, just like the governments that control the WHO. (applause) Pfizer doesn't need a PR man, they've got the Prime Minister! Secretary Clinton has a number of super packs and in the last filing period reported receiving 15 million dollars from Wall Street. (booing) My whole life I've been a business man. I've contributed to most of them. I've given to democrats, I've given to Hillary, I've given to everybody! Because that was my job. I gotta give to them because when I want something I get it. When I call... they kiss my ass. Ok, it's true, they kiss my ass. (cheering and applause) Politics are losing power. And that's also reflected in the financing of the WHO. In the 1990s, all countries froze their membership contributions in the wake of the financial crisis, Desperate times do indeed call for desperate measures. We are in a mess. The financial crisis hit the world like a sudden jolt and it hit the world where it hurts most... money. Today UN organisations, foundations, NGOs and industry contribute almost 40 percent of the WHO's annual budget. The second largest source of finance right after the USA is the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. 30 years ago, in starting Microsoft we had a very ambitious vision: a computer for everyone. Now I join you in seeking to achieve an even more important vision which is good health for every human being. Today the WHO relies on voluntary contributions like that from the Gates foundation, but these are often linked to conditions. Bill Gates declares, 'our priorities are your priorities', not the other way around. A Freudian slip? Our priorities are your priorities. (applause) Today the WHO's annual budget amounts to about 2bn dollars. Coca Cola spends twice that much on advertising alone. And the hospitals around lake Geneva spend 6bn dollars a year. When it was founded, the WHO could decide how to distribute it's funds itself. Now 70 percent of it's budget is tied to particular projects, countries or regions. If the WHO receives funding to fight malaria for example, it can't use that money to combat Ebola. (background chatter) The Ebola interim assessment panel put it in very precise words. In present WHO does not have the operational capacity or culture to deliver a full emergency public health response. (applause) (narrator) What does the Director General of the WHO think about that? I want to ask her what constraints she is under. I need that! (laughing) Newspaper? No I'm doing a cinema documentary, I'm a filmmaker. Ahh, ok, let's discuss the date. You don't want July, August? No August would also be possible. July, August whatever, not so hectic. If that's better for you then ok I will adapt my schedule. (music) Since I can't get to speak to Margaret Chan, I meet one of her close advisors. (music and ambient sounds) I think it's simply a wrong perception to think there can be external independent review. Because then you have to say who is selecting this independent expert, and who is controlling their independence and who is controlling the independence of those controlling the independence. There is no external entity as such independent. Of course he's right, but he's wrong. - You know, he's mixing everything up because - this world is as it is and you have to do what you can to make sure that the independence of the science is as good as possible. It will never ever be perfect, he's quite right by that, but he should be talking about his own. I mean he's from Switzerland, he came straight from Switzerland which is a country that is completely locked in to a partnership approach and he's in charge of partnerships at WHO. So I know Gaudenz was very keen that any countries could come in, as long as it was transparent he didn't mind. This is our opposition to the non state actors thing as it is, ok? Namibia will be onside with us isn't it? African groups generally are worried about it. How many people are in? Quite a few now. Yeah quite a few, that's enough. What's going on with them? Next room - Next room What's happening there is those industrialised countries that would really like to expand their markets into the developing world, they are finding a way to let WHO allow these companies in to influence policy. (speaker) The world in which the WHO operates today is very different from the world in which the organisation was established more than 60 years ago. Member states are also influenced by non state actors. But since they are our bosses, and they're sovereign member states, if it's a private sector entity, if it's an NGO or whoever influences them, as long as they make it a national position, it's a national position and we accept it as such. (music) (children playing) Professor Yamashita is contributing to the trivialisation of the risk of radioactive contamination in public. Yamashita works together with the WHO in cases of nuclear catastrophe. Is the WHO downplaying the dangers of nuclear radiation? Is it for example, keeping silent about a rise in thyroid cancer? There's a lot here about Swine flu and almost nothing about Fukushima. I would like to talk to the Director General about this in person. Maybe you can help me, how can I get an interview with Margaret Chan. (inaudible) Very difficult. I have to become friends with you, ok I see. (man) She's very busy. I know I know, this is why I'm asking. Can we get you someone else? No. Look, no one can promise you interview with Dr Chan because she really prefers others to speak. So there are some circumstances where she does it but nothing that can be guaranteed. (music) (children shouting) It's difficult to find anybody who is allowed to talk. The mayor of Matsumoto, Akira Sugenoya, is also a doctor and has founded a convalescence camp for children from contaminated areas. Konichiwa! As a result of experience after Chernobyl, the WHO recommendations for issuing iodine were revised in the year 1999 under the supervision of the British scientist Keith Baverstock, a member of staff at the WHO. (music) Thank you Mr. moderator for that kind introduction, and thank you for the invitation to come and present here. I guess I... Ok I want to start this presentation by saying a few words about lessons learnt from a previous nuclear power plant accident, namely the one in Chernobyl in 1986. When I started my programme with WHO, within a few weeks I learnt that there was a claim that there was a large number of thyroid cancers in children and this ended up in the mission to Minsk. We saw an astonishing number of children who'd been operated for thyroid cancer. Quite young children, so to see as we did on that day possibly 1 maybe 12 cases in one place at one time, all having been operated was really quite extraordinary. We took it from there. And with our Belarusian colleagues published two short papers in the journal nature to draw attention to it. After the papers were published, WHO asked me to withdraw the paper from Nature. A paper published with about 5 or 6 other people, all agreeing on this position. And he asked me to withdraw that paper from publication. After it had been published. Chrysler who worked at WHO Geneva, yes. He threatened me. How did he threaten you? With my career. He said your career will be shortened if you don't do this. And was it shortened? No. I wonder why in Fukushima area it wasn't distributed. I don't know. I don't know, they should have given them. Yeah. They don't like to cause panic. Did you have any contact with WHO after the TEPCO accident? I still find it beyond belief that Naoto Kan was convinced at the time that no radioactivity would emerge after the accident. Just one day after the accident a monitoring station of the organisation CTBTO recorded raised levels of radioactivity 200km from the nuclear power station. (music) But who is right? (chanting) (applause) What do you think today about iodine intake after nuclear accident? Well again it's more or less what was said in the video. People are not taking iodine as of the moment the Japanese authorities have no said that should be done. They have distributed iodine tablets, pre-positioned them but have not yet asked anyone to take them. Taking iodine tablets in the absence of iodine radiation is actually bad for you. You need to match iodine, taking iodine to the exposure. I understand but, from today's point of view was the exposure given at that time in most affected areas or not? You know, again, that's almost 5 years ago and I can't remember the process from day to day and certainly we would have adapted our recommendations based on the information we were getting. But there are these guidelines and it's written in here you should take iodine within the first 6 hours after nuclear accident. It's in here and it's also clear that it was not given in Fukushima, it's also a fact, it's not something you have to look up, it's obvious. Ok. I really think you are wasting your time on this topic. And that we should move on to other topics because I only have until 12 o'clock. Is it that you can't say something critical about the Japanese government? I... WHO, work on the basis of facts and if I don't have the facts and the information at my fingertips I am not going to speculate. Yeah, but in general is it possible for WHO to criticise nations? I'm not going to say anything more about this, why should I say anything more. No this was a general question, not in relation to Fukushima. Well let's move on to another topic. Ok. (music) (inaudible) Yeah yeah the speaker. Well I know what is his role, not to answer anything, it's to around, around, around, around... This is the problem. One of the serious problems of WHO is the media policing because they are trying to avoid any conflict, to avoid anything. So they are not talking openly and transparently to the people. So what struck me was that your questions are odd and out of date. No it's a great organisation, I'm the spokesperson for the organisation I do this day in and day out. I love the job. Is it getting more difficult now that WHO has lost trust? Who says WHO has lost trust? Is that you? (music) (road noise) I am Alison Katz, I worked for the World Health Organisation myself for 18 years and since I have left I have been involved in independent WHO which works in the area of radiation and health and we have been in front of the World Health Organisation headquarters in Geneva for 7 years now and it is a permanent peaceful protest. So that the world understands that somebody is witnessing the victims of radiation which includes almost everybody. The Japanese people are already talking and they are reporting very serious health effects in children that the WHO is ignoring. It's not talking about, doesn't mention in it's report. You know. At the time of Chernobyl, the people couldn't talk freely. (music) The New York Academy of Science book, this one, comes up with an estimate of 985,000 deaths, that is worldwide, between 1986 and 2004. And of course that makes a dramatic contrast with what the establishment says, which is still around 50 deaths and possibly 4000 cancers as a final total. The other major omission is that the WHO has never considered anything except cancer as a health effect. (speaking foreign language) (aeroplane noise) Since January we know that there are other diseases What other diseases? Unfortunately, um yeah... for example... Cardiovascular diseases, infertility, thyroid diseases other than cancer. There's a book, maybe you heard about it, of the Academy of Science. Which was reputed by the New York Academy of Sciences because it's so unsound. But that's not true. - Yes. If you read the statement from the New York Academy of Sciences, in 2011 or 12 they repudiated the book. Let me give you this. This is from the journal of radiology and it's a review of the New York Academy of Science's book which talks about all the flaws in it. Ok, ok. So I should also give you something. A book review by independent WHO. Yeah - Yeah Ok we read this and then we meet again. (phone dialing) Hello, this is Lilian Franck. What does it mean exactly that the New York Academy of Science repudiate the Chernobyl book. The editor tells me that the Academy never repudiated the book. He permits me to record the phone call, but later he withdraws his permission. Isn't he able to speak freely either? When I try to confront the WHO press spokesman with the statement, he doesn't take my calls. So he doesn't take it. Do you wanna try with my Italian number? Why not, thanks! Like mine? Ah yeah. Hi Gregory, this is Lilian, good to hear you. The press spokesman refuses to give me another interview. I'm good and you? He says he's spent enough time with me already. I was wondering whether we could meet again for another interview. No? Why not?! Perhaps the publisher of the Chernobyl book can help me. (dialing tone) (Sherman) Good morning Good morning! The original contact person at the New York Academy of Sciences agreed to publish the book. And then there was a big to-do at the New York Academy and they did not think was a good idea. And I suspect that they were pressured by the nuclear industry but I don't know for sure. (music) How big is the influence of the nuclear industry? Here at home, nuclear power is also an important part of our own energy future. As you know I'm a big believer in Nuclear power. (typing) The international Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, wants to promote the safe and peaceful use of atomic energy. Nuclear power will remain an important and viable option for many countries as a clean and stable source of energy. (muffled voices) The WHO is concerned with health. These are different priorities but the two organisations are working closely together. For example, together with other UN organisations they are compiling a report about the health consequences of Chernobyl. I'm a critic of WHO and they tended not to invite critics for their two reports, one on health one on the environment. What kind of people are these? Do you know some of them or? Yes I know most of them. There's certainly a good bunch. But the trouble is that they are outweighed by the scientists from IAEA. And erm... because they're the ones who ruled the roost, who dictated the agenda. The thing was that there would be a whole series of informal meetings going on between WHO and IAEI at quite senior levels, very senior levels. And they would predetermine what line they would take. That's why they had a WHO / IAEI meeting in Vienna in 2005, in October 2005 To put the line across, this is it, this is what we're going to do. The trouble was that many, many people came opposed to all this. (music) Maria Neira works at the WHO. She is responsible for the risks of radioactive contamination. I deliberately make an appointment to see her in Paris. The press department won't get in the way here. To make sure she agrees to see me, I don't tell her what I want to talk about until we first meet. (Neira) It's like Chernobyl, there is a book saying that there have been 1 million deaths that the WHO is hiding, how can you have 1 million deaths, come on. Seriously, 1 million deaths. And then the humanity will not, I mean 1 million. Yeah but this is because they were looking at the broader part of the world population. Yeah but 1 million deaths, you think that you can hide 1 million deaths? Yeah but do you seriously think Which records, do you have mortality records? How can you seriously believe that Chernobyl accident caused 50 deaths. No we didn't say that. But it's still on the WHO website! (music) So we wrote the other report and the initials are TORCH which is torch. We said right away that we expected somewhere between 30 and 60,000 altogether worldwide future deaths. Because the plume from Chernobyl went right round the world. The northern hemisphere. And whilst the concentrations were low, far, far away, it doesn't matter because there were many, many millions of people. There are 600 million people in Europe alone and they were all affected. Politicians who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. The purpose of this report was looking at the exposure and the doses to which people have been exposed. What is the risk that we can expect and I think this is more human than trying to predict how many people will die from cancer. The other reason why we were not using cancer mortality figures but rather incidents is because as you know most of the cancers can now be treated and therefore there was no mortality associated. I don't know whether you have noticed but our health risk assessment is only with the log of WHO. But I mean if once heard of the experts belonged to IAEA. This is kind of anticipating that those experts from IAEA are not on the best of their science, which is the case, I don't think they were there to represent any interest. I mean it was criticised that there was no oncologist or no radiobiologist also no scientist who published critical articles on health effect of nuclear energy. But when you need to do a scientific report, it's not a question of bringing an activist from the left wing, an activist from the right wing. It's a question of science. What's happened is that there are groups outside that they want to use those accidents to say you see nuclear energy is bad, is dangerous, why we don't stop the use of nuclear energy, which is a different cause. Do you think it could also be the other way round, that nuclear industry... tries to not to tell the whole truth about the health impacts. Absolutely, I have no doubt for sure. (ambient sounds) (eerie sound) Of course we are not perfect but we are there and we are doing the best we can and with the support of everybody who recognises that there is a need for a global public health very heavy institution, heavy in the good sense, with weight, institution, powerful institution, it will be the best for all of us. And I will fight for that for the rest of my life. I'm a convinced public health officer and I think my record accredits that if we need to fight, I am not afraid. A scientist in the United States this past spring made the observation that this generation of children is the first generation in modern history that is not going to be as healthy as their parents. That should not be. What do I do with this knowledge now? Go out on the streets together with independent WHO, or just go home again? First I have to speak to the Director General. (dialing tone) I was talking to Margaret Chan for an interview during World Health Assembly. She said yes she would like to give it but I didn't get any answer so far. I'm just concerned about WHO and it's image in the film. It's really important that I could talk to Margaret Chan. You know I'm very flexible, it doesn't have to take long time. (voice on phone) It's not about time it's about her physically being in the office. Hello, this is Lilian. Do you think we can do the interview tomorrow? (man on phone) Mm probably not. (ambient sounds and soft music) The queue for demands for her is so long that you'd be waiting another 5 years. (soft music) Am I at the end now? Is there any real end? Margaret Chan carries on. But I don't know I mean she is very patient to stay there because in my place I was goodbye. You are destroying, this is your business, you are... the organisation, I'm not going to help. And probably at one point she has to realise that she is helping and serving the interest of the people giving funds to WHO. (music) So last summer, an editor from the WHO's official journal world health bulletin invited me to write an editorial on psychological impact of the Fukushima accident on evacuees and I agreed to do that. It was rejected on the grounds that it contained criticism of WHO and the Japanese authorities. Well of course it did. I mean there were things wrong. I think the editors words were: 'the world health bulletin will not be a platform for such criticism, no matter how valid'. (music) So this year will you go to the World health assembly to the UN building? No. I'm still not allowed in. Why? Because apparently I asked too many disobliging questions, they won't renew my accreditation. I've annoyed people. And I have written about things they don't want me to write about. (music) Why did you stop working at WHO? I was fired. I was a staff association representative and we organised the first, it wasn't even a strike it was a go-slow in 2005 and it was to protest against the levels of corruption in WHO. Nepotism, mainly nepotism. Corruption. And of course they were absolutely horrified, so it was a huge success, but three weeks after that, my post was abolished. Right, it's over to you folks, who'd like to start the round of questions? Is it on? Can you hear me? Yeah, ok. Lilian Franck, OVALmedia. It's a question to Dr. Chan. We just learnt that refugee health and climate change are huge global health challenges. But I'm asking myself how can we meet them if WHO is constantly losing power. Important donor nations, they want a weak WHO, one could even compare WHO to Titanic I would say. So isn't it your responsibility Dr. Chan to step down before the end of your second term in order to signal to the world that your organisation, you ship is sinking. You ask an excellent question. If I tell you WHO as an organisation, only 30 percent of my budget is predictable funds. Other 70 percent I have to take a hat and go around to world to beg for money. And when they give us the money they are highly linked to their preferences, what they like. It may not be the priority of WHO so if we do not solve this, you know, we are not going to be as great as we were. (music)
