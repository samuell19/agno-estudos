Every woman is not built for the great responsibility of being a first lady. Lee-Curtis and I... we're just gonna get to the other side. Always, we're gonna get to the other side. You know... Have you ever seen a rat go from the inside of a house to the outside of a house? They chew through. So we're-we're gonna gnaw through the hardest parts. I mean, not that we're rats, obviously, but just that tenacity. So that's good.

Pastor Lee-Curtis Childs and wife First Lady Trinitie Childs together have donated enough money to pay off the entire debt of the county.-Praise Jesus! God loves those who worship him. You know that Rolls-Royce out there in the parking lot? I didn't buy that. The helicopter? It's not really mine, no. All of these wonderful things are because I worked hard and invested in God! Pastor Lee-Curtis Childs is letting both the mayor and the governor host their fundraisers at his megachurch. The new learning center at Wander to Greater Paths Baptist Church helmed by First Lady Trinitie Childs promises to bring quality education to underserved communities. I love my faithful daughters and my spiritual sons! And I am devoted to y'all. Every last one of you. And with that same devotion, you, too, can be prosperous. You, too, can be blessed! Amen! Pastor Childs! Pastor Childs, are the allegations true? - Sir! - No comment. First Lady, do you have any comment? A little space, please. Thank you very much. First Lady Childs, will you stay? Maybe I should dip into the Old Testament a bit more. Mm. Mm-hmm. I like some of the Old Testament. It's got rigor. Could be good for our new look. Straddling the new and the old. I could perfect a good powerful straddle, don't you think? Uh, baby. Uh, scraping. That's Memaw's china. Something on your mind? Mm. We just have a big day ahead of us, that's all. It's about the cameras. And you're nervous. - Don't be. - It's just making sure that this doesn't end up poorly for us. Anita Bonet is a renowned filmmaker. - I've never heard of her. - Come on, now. She done won awards. Be all up and through them film festivals. Okay. Well... This is gonna chronicle the ultimate comeback. This Easter is our revival. Our renaissance. We winners, baby. You married a winner. And that's all I intend to do. Hey, I'm Rocky up in this fight. Rocky didn't win. How's that, now? Well, he-he went the distance, you know, the whole 15 rounds against Apollo Creed, but he didn't... he didn't actually win. All right. But he did win in Rocky II. Lord, baby, how many times I got to tell you? Get past the first movie. That one's all setup! Lord have mercy. Jesus, they're here. Mm. Mm. We're doing this. Showtime. This has been our place of ministry for, whew, well, almost nine years now. You know, we-we started out small but just grew like weeds. - Didn't it, hon? - Sure did. And before long, we had all this. That's all through the blessings of the Lord, though. 26,000 members every single Sunday! It was a sight to see. Mm-hmm. Yes, it was. Now, I'm telling y'all, you should have seen this place when it was jumping. Course, it hasn't looked like that for a while, obviously. No. No. But we gonna get that all back. Oh, yeah, we will. Have this place looking all... Oh. - Shit. Shit! - Oh. Oh, boy. - Oh, my goodness. - Now, how in the good Lord's lush green earth is anybody supposed to take me... -Okay. And the resurrection of my church seriously if I... - It... Yes. - These are Fianos! Those are... that's an Italian brand. - Sorry. - So... - Uh, we can edit around that, - right, Anita? - Yeah. - Can she hear? - I don't know. Anita! Ah. That's right. Y'all the fly-on-the-walls type? They're not gonna talk back to you, baby. That's not how they do this. Okay. Y'all got to excuse my unholy language back there. - Yes, yes. - I just... Yes. I would've got mad at that, too. - Whoo. Even, uh, Jesus lost it in the temple that day. It probably was gum in the temple, too. Okay, strength of the Lord. Won't he do it? - All the time. - Won't he do it? All the time. Oh. Okay. Uh, over there is our creative arts center. They ain't ready. Come on. That's where our world-renowned dance ministries rehearse. We got hip-hop. We got ribbon twirling. - Miming. - Right in there. Now, have y'all ever seen praise miming? 'Cause we do it all the time here, right, Trin? - Uh-oh. - Ooh, boy! Uh, y'all l-look at the railings? You know, we like to keep a few options here on the church's campus. Never know when you're gonna need something. -Yeah. This one time, a White House correspondent stopped by... Oh. -...and I had on something fantastic. - Yes. Yeah. - It was a pinstripe. But... do pinstripes evoke matters of state? No, no. Luckily, we had all this here to switch it up. - Mm-hmm. - And this is just as important - as any White House visit. - Yeah, yeah. - All right? - Ab... Yeah, absolutely. So, uh, what are you thinking, hon? What is calling you for our first Sunday back? None of these. - Mm-mm. Nothing in here. - No? See, our first Sunday back is Easter Sunday, - and that... right? - Yeah, yeah. That deserves something special. Something new. - Uh, yeah. - Yeah. - You-you sure? Nothing in here? - May I? I'm gonna tell you what I'm thinking. - Oh. Okay. I'm thinking Prada. - Right? - Mm. There is... I'm t... I'm telling you, there is just something about a pastor in Prada. It just... it gives you chills. Well, I have been blessed with some beautiful Prada. What you think? - Uh, purple Prada? - Hmm. I like the color. You know what? We don't want to go too extravagant. Yeah, we want people to really see us, look deep into our souls, and I don't think you quite get there with the purple. This is nice, too. Y'all can get... - That's cute! - Yeah, it's real cute. - Oh, my goodness. I like it. - I like it. I like it. - I like that, too. I like it. - I like that. Come on, now. - Oh, you got the peach Prada. - I got the peach Prada. - The periwinkle Prada. - The periwinkle Prada. - The pearl Prada. - Pearl Prada. We got a... Lord have mercy. I got a pearl... Look at him. Look at him! Some people think it's excessive. My old deacon board. They get so riled up about some of these divine additions. And it just got, uh... unmanageable. I prayed on it, though. And God eventually told me to just be free. See, the Lord revealed unto Lee-Curtis that deacons, well, they just... they didn't work for our ministry. - Mm, you know what he told me? - Hmm. He told me that I needed to be rid of such an ungodly governmental structure. Yeah, yeah. That-that was a quote, too. Because what good are disciples if they are undisciplined? It's not to worry, though. It's, uh, just a slight unpleasantness. All a thing of the past. And now look. Now we've been blessed with an indoor fountain. - Yeah. - Baby. Baby, go turn the fountain on for me. - Oh. Yes. Sorry. Excuse me. - Wait till you see it. - Here we go. Here we go. Mm. Mm. What you think? Come here. Mm. - Give them the finger. - Okay. - Bang. - Oh, right here. - Smile. Smile. - Mm-hmm. Okay. All right, caller, you're on the air with LT and Jamila here on WRX 104. And we're about to get into this whole Wander to Greater Paths situation. What are some of your thoughts? I mean, I'm really hoping they open back up. Pastor Childs and his sermons were the reason I got my shit together and stopped running numbers and dedicated my life to Christ. Ooh, and if they looking to put folks in the movie, I just want to say that I act and sing. I do hair. I could do... Prominent megachurch pastor Lee-Curtis Childs faces allegations of sexual misconduct. He maintains that all the allegations against him are false. Criminal charges are not a part of the discussion, but a settlement is on the table, with many speculating the payoffs have begun. Niggas keep shouting "victim this, victim that." Ain't no motherfucking victims. Y'all tell me. The pastor break the law? No? A'ight, then. As a result of the allegations, Trinitie Childs, the first lady of the Baptist church, has been mum but has stuck by her husband. What I don't get is his wife. How could she not know? How could she stand being with a man like that? Ugh. Just makes my skin crawl. Please. A little space. Thank you. Do you have any comment? No comment? Although we're both pastors at Heaven's House, the Pastor and First Lady Childs have been a huge inspiration for us, as up-and-coming church leaders, of course. But also as-as a couple covered under the Lord. - It's just... - Uh... It's so sticky. - So sticky. - This situation. But we only pray for the best - for everyone involved. - Mm-hmm. And prayer works, y'all. When all this was first going down, I prayed that the first lady would un-file those divorce papers she served the pastor. And look what the Lord did. Kept those two beautiful souls together. That is a silver lining if ever there was one. That and our congregation growth. Now, not that we wish anyone's downfall... -No. But the fact that these souls had another church home to go to for the good Word of God, - that is also a blessing. - Amen. 'Cause we want to help heal this community. - - Right? - Yes. And-and I just hope that the Lord will see everyone through this, uh, absolute landfill of a circumstance. - We could only hope... - Mm. To achieve that sanctified success that Wander to Greater Paths has. One of these days, huh? ♪ One of these days, huh? ♪ ♪ One of these days ♪ - ♪ One of these days ♪ - ♪ One of these days ♪ - ♪ One of these days ♪ - ♪ One of these days ♪ Hey, did-did y'all find, um, parking okay? 'Cause we had to add a little, um, overflow section to the parking lot recently. You did? Okay. All right. Wonderful. - ♪ One of these days ♪ - ♪ One of these days. ♪ Um... let me tell you something about the devil. He'll creep up on you and just crawl his way into your life and under your skin like a... roach under the floorboards. He'll hold on tight, too. Uh, look. Look. - We've prayed. Okay? - We have. We-we-we are past this stage in our lives now. Now we are here. - Right here. - Yes. And, uh, ready to get back to just - doing good Christian work. - Mm. Anyways, so we got some good people outside waiting to come in and meet y'all. - Yeah. They are... our real followers. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. They stuck by us. Even with all the awfulness - that-that folks was conjuring. - Yeah. And they're gonna be sanctified witnesses to what you all are about to see. Oh, we're here because we want to be. When I was coming up through the church, you didn't just up and leave your place of worship because of any old thing. Mm-mm. Besides, wasn't nothing even confirmed. I bet this whole talk of a settlement is just to get the thing good and over with. I don't think that you're posing the right questions here, my beautiful sister. When will we, as a Christian culture, realize that we got it all wrong? Pastor Childs is just ahead of his time. He's a visionary. Well, little Aria here only likes a few things. That's paintball guns, real guns, church and that TV show where the little animals talk in the high-pitched voices. Once you weigh everything out, church was the least taxing, so we try to do it as much as we can. Don't we, little Aria? Come back down here. Now, let me tell you something. The church I came up at when I was a little girl, the musical director was found out to be in one of those sex groups. You know, those, um, um... - Orgies. - Uh, yup. Mm-hmm. And-and not just the regular ones. Had him crawling round on all fours, pretending he was a horse and such. You know what the elders did? They kept him. His service had done more for our church than just any old discretions could soil. Pastor Childs' word saves folks. And you don't just go replacing somebody with the spirit of the Lord in him like that. A lot of the former WTGP members ran right on over to Heaven's House with Pastor and Pastor Sumpter. - I just don't think... - Excuse me? The, uh, Sumpters, did you say? He has so much love. It's just about written in the Bible that he should spread it as far and wide as he can. Now, to whom it spreads to... well, that's gonna require our deepest prayers. But he'll get right. I believe him. You know what, let me just go spruce myself up a bit, then we can really get this thing started off right. Y'all just give me one moment. Gonna get my good jacket. Oh, my goodness. Um, Anita, can we... Can you cut for a sec? I just want to clarify some things before we... before we get started, just make sure that we're working towards the same goal. Okay? You know, it's, uh, well... Lee-Curtis is working so, so hard. So hard. And so am I, you know? You-you... You got to be strong to be a first lady. Smart. Uh... Diligent. Uh, uh... It's-it's real mental and psychological gymnastics. And, um... well... The pastor may be the-the head and face of a congregation, but... the neck and-and the spine, the-the... the structure? That is all the first lady. And so... I just need to make sure that we are structurally sound. Okay, Anita? I-I... I need to know that we're on the same team. That we want to make a great film because... -Hey. Well, because that's what we want to make. -Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Baby. Baby! Come on, now. I already told you that these are good people. Yes. Yes. Yes. They only care about what the world cares about. And what the world cares about is a man of God back and better than ever as a new and improved preacher. - Ain't that right, y'all? - Mm-hmm. Uh, so like I said... we got some good people outside waiting to come in and meet y'all. - Oh, boy. - Mm-hmm. You there. Yeah, with the big old microphone. Come in closer, son. - No, no, that's... - It's okay. - Closer. Come on, son. - I think that's good. Right there. -You gonna want to hear all of this. All right? Yeah. -They gonna want to hear all of this. Everybody can hear. All right, everyone. I've gathered you here today... - Mm. To culminate the first day of my rebirth the right way. I am new. Mm. And I will submit my newness right here in front of you and in the eyes of the Lord. But first... you gonna see what all the fuss is about. - Showtime! - Oh. Uh-oh. Come here. - No, no, no. - No, no. I just... I'm just trying to see if I can get a rise out of her. - No. No. - Hey, now! Today's word. Restraint in the name of the Lord. Now, who here can name an instance from the Bible where the lack of restraint was punished? Little Aria, go ahead, baby. Um, well, um, in my last class, we, um, learned about Adam and Eve. And they were bad because they didn't listen to God. That's right, sweetheart. Look at you making your way in a grown-up service. This little baby is right on it. Mm. Did Eve show restraint, little Aria? No, Pastor Childs. Did she ignore God's graces and allow herself to be swayed by temptation? Yes, sir, Pastor Childs. Yes, sir. -Ooh. Women! The "wo-man." The birther of the original sin. But you have the blessing of restraint deep within you. - Can I get an amen? - Amen! But you're gonna need to suit up, because the journey to holy restraint is a battle. - Right. - And to win that battle, you gonna need every tool that you can think of. -Praise! You gonna need the sword of the Spirit to cut through evil! You gonna need the shield of faith to keep the devil from penetrating your soul! But you got to bring yourself to our Lord and Savior in order to receive them. Yes. Are you ready for your blessings, baby? I want all my blessings! Then come get 'em. Ooh. Oh, Jesus! Hallelujah. Bless this child. Praise you, Jesus. ♪ I know he's all right ♪ - Oh, yes, yes! - Yes, God. ♪ I know he's all right ♪ - Thank you, Lord Jesus. - Praise him, baby. Yes, praise him. Lord, God Almighty. Yes, Lord! Yes, God! Come on! I love the theater. Yes, Lord God. Mm. I feel you in me. I feel you deep within me. Hallelujah. You know what you were pushing me to be. To be the best possible version of myself that I can be. You're pushing me to be brand-new. To be brand-new! I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live. But Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith - in the Son of God... - Whoo. It's chilly. Who loved me and gave himself for me. Lord, we come to you on this glorious day. Allow us to stay strong and know that when man falters, - God stays steady and sure. - Yes. Yes, God. Buried with him in the likeness of his death. Raised with him in the likeness of his resurrection to walk in the newness of life. Yes, Lord. Yes, Jesus. Oh, God. Yes. Yes, God. - Hallelujah! - Praise! Saved... Saved again. - Hallelujah! Thank you. - Hallelujah! -Praise! Saved again! Hear us, Lord. Thank you, Lord. In Jesus's name we pray. - "Ay-men!" - "Ah-men!" - Now, I thought we said... - No. No, no, no. No. Uh... We agreed, remember? We agreed that "ah-men" was a little... - No, but I just think we got to keep up with the times. Right? And all the people that's hot and popping on the Internet, - they say the "ay-men." - Okay. Remember, we are on the same page. - Yeah. Yes, we are. - Okay? Right. - Of course we are. Yeah. - Yeah. Okay, okay. Uh, Anita, we're gonna take that last part, uh, one more time, okay? Everyone, we're gonna take that last part one more time! Okay.

Okay. - Hey, uh... - It's okay. - Can we, um... - Yeah? Can you just, can you just do the other thing? Please, baby. I-I really need you to help me out here. Yeah, baby. Of course. Thank you, God. Y'all want to know where God has really blessed me? Where I'm the richest and the most prosperous? Not that I'm not eternally grateful for the jets and the cars and the designer suits. But where God has really showed out his blessings - is in my marriage... - Uh-huh. To my wonderful wife. Now, I... I have to be honest. Marriage is hard. It's work. It is the only thing in my life that I've been blessed with that requires true energy to sustain. But it is, without a shadow of a doubt, a blessing. Yes! Man is made for woman, woman is made for man, and it is a beautiful thing. And it is written and it's the Word of God. Now, what is not beautiful and what is not made out of God's love is the homosexual agenda. It disregards, it disrespects, and it devalues the marriage I work so hard for every day. And not just mine. Yours. And yours. And yours. And yours. And yours. Speak on it, Pastor! It is man and woman and marriage. That is the only way to prosperity. And that is the only way into the kingdom of God. Take it from me. I am the prophet with the beautiful wife and the gorgeous Bugatti. So you just got to get it close to the scalp, like as tight as possible. And then this beauty here goes on like so. And voilà. This the style the church ladies like to get. It's got to be slick and laid to fit all the adornments on top. Because if there's one thing those church ladies love, it's a good hat. ♪ We're gonna be all right... ♪ Sanctuary! In the church, we have this saying: "Come as you are." But, you know, that-that's mostly sentiment, of course. Sure, you could just, I guess, roll out of bed and come praise the Lord in your T-shirt and flip-flops, I guess. But we also have another saying: "God don't like ugly." Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Do you see this, Anita? It's like a work of art. Don't you think? Oh, my God. What is... Ooh. What is this? Mm. Come here, Anita. Go ahead. Touch this. This is crystal beading and spider silk. A combination like this is... it is holy and sexy all at once. Imagine. Wait a minute. Isn't it the most remarkable thing you've ever seen? The first lady comes in here a lot these days. Mm-hmm. It's a rough spot to be in. But, whoo, these men... They'll do it to you, won't they? Chew you up, spit you out, and then curse you for not giving them enough nutrients. That woman deserves every hat in the store. Uh... Would you just, uh... would you excuse me? Thank you. Uh, no, no, no. Uh, I-I think we're good here. Okay, we've-we've got... we've got enough. Anita... I said we are done. All right? God bless. Thank you. Word on the street is that this Wander to Greater Paths lawsuit is closing in. And it's got the streets shook. What's going on, caller? Yeah, they were young, but they were adults. Uh, they agreed to doing all that shit. Right? These niggas was what, like 18, 19, 20? That's grown as hell. This ain't even like that mess with the priests and stuff you be hearing about. Those be actual, factual kids, you know what I'm saying? I don't believe the pastor did none of that such shit with them niggas. Every time a Black man get some power, here come folks trying to tear him down. It's a damn shame. Mm. The way I see it, the first lady is doing what she needs to do. That's grown woman stuff right there. That lady right there is strong. Y'all waited for me? I thought I said you could just... You know what? It's fine. I just had to finish some last-minute shopping... Girl stuff... and I just did not think that you all would even - be interested, so I... - First Lady? First Lady. Sister Denetta. How are you? Oh, look at you. Look at you. Oh, bless your heart. Look at you. And bless, also, your own heart. And they are? Oh, well, we're just documenting this time in our lives. Me and Lee-Curtis, obviously, with, uh, you know, building our church back up and working towards our first service back this Easter. - Easter, you say? - Mm-hmm. That's so crazy. You know that's when the Sumpters are opening up their new Heaven's House location, right? - The Sumpters? - Mm-hmm. - Really? - Mm. - This Easter? - Mm-hmm. Yes. Of course, this might make things a little more complicated for y'all. Well, anyway, you just keep on praying. And I'm sure plenty of the old congregation will come right on back through good old Wander to Greater Paths' doors. Well, that is for sure. I know they will. Yes. But you won't, though. Right? You and your family? Word is that y'all done... y'all done went and got yourselves a new church home. Oh, well, sweetie, I had to. You know I do career counseling at the community college. - Mm. - It just wouldn't look right. You understand. - Hmm? - Mm-hmm. Yes. No, I understand. Of course I understand. But prayers up for y'all. Prayers up. - You so hood. - I keep it real. No, look. Ghetto thing. Well, I got to get going. - You have a blessed one. - Oh, my goodness. - And you have a blessed... - Okay. Look, you don't get to pick how the devil torments you. You see what I'm saying? Now, I volunteered for this, right? I chose for y'all to come down here to truly see and to show the world what I'm really about. And I promise to God, this is who I am. You know? I did not hurt anybody. No, no, no, no. Hurt? Nobody was hurt with me or by me. If anything, I was too warm, okay? Was too generous. You know, part of this whole thing that I remain proud of... And I will not budge on this... Is that I did mentor those individuals who are all now so, uh, bothered. I was a light and a guiding force in their lives. That's all that was. It was me being a giver. I'm a sinner. Okay? Like any other human being. But, uh... I'm no, uh... pervert. I'm no criminal. A sinner, yes. But all that other horrible, awful stuff? No. You can check the facts on that. I am not a criminal. That's not me. I, uh... Just one moment. This is Lee-Curtis Childs, pastor of Wander to Greater Paths Baptist. Sh... Uh, yeah. Gary, yeah, we can, we can discuss it now. Anita, I'm gonna need y'all to give me a little bit of privacy here for a sec. Just one sec, Gary. Lee-Curtis, we need to chat about something. Uh, Anita, can you, can you guys give us the room? Uh, they're already on their way out. - Good. Uh, and I got Gary on the line, so... - Oh, good, good. Um, can you hold on one sec there, Gary. What is that? That. What is, what is that? Oh, you've never seen a church hat before? - Yeah. - No, I just picked it up. I thought it might be nice for our first Sunday. For somebody's great-aunt Thomasina maybe. I mean, come on, baby. That is so not our style, you know? You gonna make us both look... ol-old. Right? Hey, there's my beautiful girl. Uh, hey, Gary, I got, uh, Trinitie here, too, now if that's better. So, uh, so, um... Did you need to say something to me? Uh, uh, uh... N-Not-not important right now. Hmm. All right. Uh, so, uh, Anita, I'm gonna need y'all to skedaddle now, okay? Thank you. One second. Uh-huh. Yeah, Gary, we're both on. Mm-hmm. -They don't know how to act around it, - you know what I'm saying? - Mm. Oh, well, that's promising. And-and what all do we owe, to tie everything up nice and... - Can you zoom? Can you... - It says, "Stay humble." Now, wait just a minute. We've already shelled out... This is strong-arm robbery. I don't want to shell out another... Jesus fucking Christ! Uh, let-let's not use that language, Gary. Not here. Okay? These were not boys. These were a group of adults that made consenting decisions. And you make sure that that is in the paperwork, too. Okay? These folks are overcome by demonic spirits. And they're trying to make their ways into your lives, one evil step at a time. Hold on, now. You've only mentioned four. So, wait, who's the, who's-who's the holdout? Just Khalil? Well, if he won't take it, then he won't take it. All right, Gary. Let's just do it. Yes, yes, whatever the amount is, we'll handle it. We just can't have this burden on us anymore, on our church. For the love of God, let's just do what we have to do. ♪ 'Kay, I just called a play, I just called a play... ♪ Oh, hell yeah.

Man, I shot my first three on Wander to Greater Paths. The courts are beautiful, man. I used to hit 'em up just to shoot around and stuff on the weekends when I went home. Now... now I got to find somewhere else to go. So you enjoying your time here? I mean, working with Anita and the film and doing the whole sound thing? Yeah, it's solid. You get to go to new places, meet interesting people. Interesting people. Yeah, I bet. Okay, all off. Whew. That was a lot of tape. Oh, boy. Thanks for meeting me in here. I get a little shy doing this in front of the whole crew. Ah, it's all good. All good. Oh, uh, by the way, I know I got a bit sensitive the other day when I kicked y'all out of there. Um... And I know it's all about to come out and Trin is gonna want to kill me for telling too soon, but, uh... it's over. I'm good. I'm sorry. I don't, I don't... Well, we, uh... we-we've settled. That's what that whole phone call was about. Uh, all parties came to an agreement, and, uh, that's it. You know? Put all that, uh, rah-rah stuff to bed, and, well, that's all she wrote. I'm free. The war is won. Wow. That's... that's g... that's good for you. Yeah. Thank you. Wait, hold-hold on for a second. How much you want to put on this first shot? Hmm? Oh! Man. All right. - Whoo! - Oh. Oh, nah, nah. Nah, I'm no good. I'm no good. All right. All right. Well, rebound me, then. There we go. Cool job you got, man. Working on a movie like this. It's gonna be big, you know? Uh... Should be cool. Yeah. Yeah. You're a lucky young man. It's a phenomenal opportunity. How old you got to be to get a gig like this? At least 19, 20 years old, I'm thinking. - I mean, yeah, probably. - Yeah. I'm 26. Really, now? Huh. Hey, you know what I do to stay looking fresh? Strict shaving regimen. Yes, sir. I take off five years when I trim up these whiskers. Eight if my moisturizing routine is tip-top. Put you on game, son. That's important in your industry, isn't it? The air of youth. Uh, not really on my side of things. Yeah. I could definitely put you on. Hey, say, when this movie is done and the church is back and booming, you should come and do sound for our audiovisual department. That'd be real nice, wouldn't it? And then after that, well, I-I know a lot of folks in the industry. I can make some calls. Just for you, though. I don't ordinarily do that sort of thing. Oh, that should... that, you know, that could be... cool. Cool? Cool. Cool. Mm. So much scruff. My boyfriend digs it, so... Well, we can't convert them all. Ain't that right? Just getting off the mics. I'm-I'm just... I'm-a, I'm-a pack up my kit. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. It's good talking to you, young man. You let me know if I can do anything for you, okay? Hey. Did you give him anything? What? No, I just offered to help him with... We just got robbed for an obscene amount of money, all for this to go away, so we can't afford for you to go back to being your generous self with people. My God, we need peace, so you can get back in that pulpit and preaching... and get me back on that stage. Heaven's House is opening its doors Easter. Same as us. What? How do... uh, who says? Uh... Is this what you were trying to tell me before at the office when...? Because surely you wouldn't have kept something like this from me. Yeah? Yeah. I just found out myself today when I, when I... I booked my hair appointment with Yvet. - You know, that Yvet... - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I mean, sh-she knows everyone's business, - and that's how I... - Yeah. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! - Got it all out? - Yup. Okay. Well, good. Let's go for a ride. Okay, Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan, you can come on in. Oh, uh, Pastor Childs. First Lady. We were hoping you might have a moment. Well, I'm afraid we have a slew of marriage counseling sessions. Oh, we won't be long, I'm sure. And as for this lovely couple, they already look like forever to me. Yes, they do. Well, this is unexpected. This is a pleasant surprise, but it's unexpected. It's a big commitment, marriage... - Yeah. But, um... it always starts with having God at the center. That's how it lasts. - Mm-hmm. -Right? - I'm sorry. - What's-what's that, now? - Uh... You did come for marriage counseling? We typically do newlyweds or newly engaged. -Yeah. But every so often, we get a seasoned couple. Sure. No, that's not... We don't, we don't need counseling. Right? -Yes. Oh, God. Yes. Yes. -We counsel plenty of folks ourselves, and believe me, uh, we're not the kind of marriage that's in need, so... - Not at all. - I see. Then what can we do for you? Well, Pastor Sumpter and Pastor Sumpter. No, it's your opening date for your new location, which is great, by the way. Oh, it's so nice. - Amen. - We love it. I mean, don't get me wrong. This place is where we got started. - Mm-hmm. But Heaven House 2.0, ooh... - It's gonna be amazing. - Oh, I bet. Ah, I bet. And I am sure that the Lord is gonna be coursing right on up through there when you open. -Oh, yeah. It's just that... well, it can't be the fourth. One more time, now. Uh, she's saying you-you can't open up. Not-not this Easter. All right? - It-it doesn't work. - Yes, exact... - Thank you, honey. Thank you. - Oh. Well, I... I just don't see how that's possible. - Well, surely it's possible. - Yes. Yes. All-all things are possible with God. - That-That's Matthew 19:26. - Come on, now. Yes, it is. No. I don't think it is. See, uh... we've been preparing for this day for - like a year now. - Mm-hmm. Amen. It's a big step for us. And, you know, Easter is so perfect for something like this. - A revival of sorts. - Right. Exactly. And that is just what Wander to Greater Paths needs. A revival. Uh, which is why we also chose Easter. - We did. - You see? And we chose that date a while back, believe me. So, really, it just comes down to this point. Um... We cannot both reopen our churches on Easter Sunday. It would be, well, it would be too confusing for folks, you know? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. They would have to choose, and, well... Right. They'll make their choice, I think. Look, uh, we adore y'all. Really. We used to be congregation members at WTGP. Right. Until we struck out on our own. Uh, it's just... We belong here. We believe in the Gospel, and we believe in the Word and all the hard work that we've done - to get to this place... - Mm-hmm. Mm. Where enough, uh, enough people will hear us for it to make a difference. That's all we've ever wanted. So we can't do what y'all are asking. - What we can do is pray. - Mm. That there are enough souls to go around for all of us. -Amen. Y'all want to pray? We got two gathered right here. - We are okay. - Right, y'all. - Y'all start it off. - Yeah, you all. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. All right. - Heavenly Father... - Mm. We thank you for this space to come together and build and heal this community, Lord. -Amen. We thank you for the grace of these beautiful, powerful leaders coming in and showing us the way, being role models in your mighty name, Lord. -Mm. - ♪ Oh, Lord. ♪ - Hallelujah. Mm. So, hey, we-we figure something else out. You know, we just... We push forward. Fuck the Sumpters. I mean, bless them in the work they do, but really. Did you hear me? - I said, we... - Right. Right. Yeah. No. Uh, baby, I heard you. So I been thinking. We do what we do best. We outdo them. We put on a show so good folks won't think twice about another church. -Mm-hmm. Yeah. -They opening this Easter Sunday. Right? So it's like you said. Fuck 'em. They just doing it to spite us. I know it. You know it. But there's no spiting us, baby. Okay? Easter is in just under two weeks. So, we reopen this Sunday instead. - Wait. This Sunday? - This Sunday. No. But, baby, we can't... We not... we won't be ready. - But this Sunday, we should... - Now, think about it, baby. Now is the perfect time to come back. See, everybody is expecting Easter, right? It's when Jesus rose again. But if you think back to those times, nobody knew when he was coming, if at all. This is what it's really like to embody the Lord and walk in his image. Jesus Christ was all about the shock factor! Okay, listen, no. - Yes. - All right? Listen, this is too much. There would be so much to do in just a few short days. We-we... No, no, no, we cannot. It's Pastor and Pastor Sumpter, Trin. We can't compete with a gimmick like that. The Sumpters are snatching up all our members, and we need to do something major to get them back. And we can do it, baby. We just got to make a big enough fuss, right? Pull out the pageantry, really dramatize our return. We gonna make a scene, and it's gonna be so brilliant, so seductive, people gonna come. They gonna come right on back. Hey, look at me. Look at me, Trin. Hey. God built this whole world in six days. This whole big beautiful world, all right? Now, call me overzealous, but I think I can rebuild ours in five. Wait. Lee-Curtis. Wait. Lee-Curtis, just listen to me, please. - Lee... - Come on! - ♪ Tear it down ♪ - ♪ We can make it ♪ ♪ Start over again ♪ ♪ We can make it ♪ ♪ We can make a brand-new start ♪ ♪ Start over again... ♪ We went all in for this one. Lee-Curtis was blessed with the most brilliant idea. A roadside ministry. Wander to Greater Paths opens back this Sunday! Yeah! This Sunday! Now, this is the best way to gain followers. You know, our style is-is... is more, uh, grassroots, more genuine. Folks out here... we do this sort of thing all the time in the name of God. It's good. It's... The more beeps the better. It just, it just draws attention to a worthy cause. And I cannot think of a cause more worthy than this right here. - Hey, Trin! Huh? -You ain't really getting that many beeps, baby. Huh? - What you doing? - What did you say to me? You gonna have to do a little more. Give them a show! You know, come on, girl! - Uh... - Shake it for the Lord. Shake it for the Lord. - I said, get it for the Lord! - Yeah. Yeah. - Get them honks for the Lord! - Yeah! Yeah! - Tap it on the patch! Shake it for the Lord, girl. Come on, now! Shake it for the Lord, girl. Mm. Shake it. Hey! You having a blessed day, sweetie? Huh? Well, come on down to Wander to Greater Paths. We are back in action this Sunday! And it is gonna be amazing! I can guarantee it! The spirit of the Lord is upon my heart, ladies and gentlemen. And that's what we are. We are unique emanations of love, joy and divine beauty. Praise him! - Heavenly Father, allow me to minister these people in the way - in which they need to be. - Yes, Lord! Hmm. Uh, the settlement. I'm not sure that I can address that. Uh, that's a bit difficult for us, legally. But that's all over and done with, so... Okay, okay, but, um... you want to hear about something really difficult? Okay, so get this. Um, did you know that, uh... when we first started going together, Lee-Curtis was Baptist and I was Apostolic? And that's true. Honk for the Lord! So, yeah, we, um, we know discomfort, believe me. A little roadside spectacle? It's nothing. Yeah, we make it work. Dynamic duo. Yep. Batman and... Oh, no, that's two guys, so... Uh... I never said I was a perfect man, ladies and gentlemen. God doesn't make perfect men. But what I am is a follower of the Lord and his teach... Hey! Well, hello there. It is a beautiful day for worship. Are you looking for a church home? 'Cause Wander to Greater Paths Baptist is back. Oh! Oh, ain't this some shit. Oh. God doesn't make perfect men. But what I am is a follower of the Lord and his teachings... Uh-uh! Just fucking nasty! - Just fucking nasty! - Just stop. All of y'all up in there is disgusting! Especially your fuck-ass husband! I'm not a perfect man, ladies and gentlemen. But I'm also not the man that the media is making me out to be. You know, your nigga found a fucking loophole, right? Yeah, a fucking loophole! Trying not to repeat the actions that got me here in the first place. Anita, we don't need to get this. - Yeah. Uh-huh. Lee-Curtis... He'll be right back, so you can just stop shooting. And for every sin I've committed, I have prayed equally as much. I've been down on bent knee. - God knows that... - Pastor Childs. Uh, hello. Uh... M-Monterius West, Pastor. Uh, I'm a member of Wander to Greater Paths. W-Well, I was until... - Are you, now? - Yes, sir. I love your sermons. Especially on the holidays when y'all break out them laser lights. Them laser lights my favorite. Uh, yeah. I started that, you know? Other churches doing it now, but I was the first. I believe that. Uh, anyway, sir, I saw you over here while I was picking up down the way, and, uh, I hear y'all about to be back preaching, and, uh... I just want to thank you, Pastor Childs. My old lady brought me to your Easter service a few years back, and... I been a different man ever since, you know? I-I don't really believe in all that mess they saying about you in the news and in the paper and stuff. I know you a good man, Pastor Childs, and you gonna keep doing them good thing God be telling you to do and keep inspiring folks like me. I believe that. Thanks for that, brother. Yes, sir. You got your jewelry, your dresses and your weak-ass hats. That's the real foul-ass shit, bitch! Real weak-ass shit! - Fuck you, bitch! Yeah. Uh-huh. - Stop it. Stop it. Stop it! Let me tell you something. Me and my husband... we practice love and forgiveness. We are Christians. Not saints and not God. And we are doing the best we fucking can! Girl, fuck you! Fuck you! God bless! I'm not a perfect man, ladies and gentlemen. God doesn't make perfect men. - What I am... - No. Nope. Nope. See, uh, that's too distant, Lee-Curtis. We need to connect with people. Make them feel why they need you back in that pulpit. You're not gonna sit center pew like always? Uh-uh. No, no, no, no, no. I-I want the view of the average, everyday congregant. All right. Now go on. I'm not a perfect man, ladies and gentlemen. God doesn't make perfect men. What I am is a servant of the Lord. - Now, a servant of the Lord... - Wait. - Wait. - Hmm? Where's your gut, hon? Hmm? I-I'm not feeling any transference of raw energy. You know what I'm talking about. That's the stuff people love. Well, you won't even let me get up to that part, Trin. See, I got to ramp up to it. Okay, go ahead, then. Ramp up to it. I'm gonna be quiet. Ramp up. I... am not a perfect man, ladies and gentlemen. God doesn't make perfect men. What I am... is a servant of the Lord. And, folks, being the Lord's servant doesn't mean that you are not susceptible to being lured or seduced or ambushed by the devil. But here is the true test of faith. See, the true test doesn't happen when you falter. Okay? It is when you're low, probably at the lowest you have ever been in your life, but you overcome it. Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes! There ain't a person up in here that hasn't been tested, tempted or torn up by hell's angel. But we survive. Stronger, happier and better to serve than ever before. Hey. Mm. I'm better, y'all! I am better and bigger in the eyes of Jesus Christ. And that is through the pain and through the threats of losing everything. The things I've been through... had me wanting not another minute on God's beautiful earth. But it was my faith in him that allowed me to persevere. It was his glory and his grace that brought me back here. Back in front of you all and back in the house of the Lord where I am supposed to be! Come on, now! No, no, I am not a perfect man, everyone. Like I said before, God ain't exactly in the business of making perfect men. But with his guidance and his love... Oh, Jesus... His undying and everlasting love, he can and he does make great men. Oh, you're done. Okay, well, that-that was, that was great. That was great, Lee-Curtis. Really great. Yep. But for our first Sunday back after all of this, that just doesn't ring. See, you don't quite acknowledge... If you're trying to make people... If you think you can fool people into thinking... Well, you're just gonna have to do a little bit better than just dry excuses this time, hon. When we get people back up in here, we need to give them everything. That was everything. That up there... That was my soul. And it's not dry. That was the truth. Then we should probably practice and make it a little more convincing, huh? Trin? Yeah? You up, baby? Yeah, I'm up, Lee-Curtis. Me, too. Something's not right. We hurtling towards Sunday, and something doesn't feel quite there yet. We just not really... hitting it yet. We need to do something big out there for this last day. Something with a little oomph. Could really use your brain on this. I'll have to think on it. Yeah. All right. Mama? This is too much, Mama. You don't know what you're saying. Are you sure you don't want Lee-Curtis to come down and get some? Uh, well, he'll be a while longer. Uh, I had to slip him two Ambien last night just to get him to simmer down. He likes it. Don't worry. So, out with it. It's our last shot. Oh, girl, please. I don't know what's gonna happen if we don't make it. I'm sure some folks will show up on Sunday. I mean me and Lee-Curtis. I don't know if we can make it. I just... I'm here. I'm there. I'm everywhere. And I am working my butt off for this man and this marriage. And so is he, you know. He is working, too. I see that. I just... I just don't know if-if we're just working towards the same thing. Wow. Sometimes my child can be so damn foolish. Are you a Christian? I'm a Christian. Say it again so I'm absolutely sure. - I'm a Christian, Mama. - That's good. 'Cause you didn't sound like it for a moment. You don't know if this is gonna work. That's not for you to know. That's for God to determine. And he did that 15-something years ago when he blessed y'all's union. And look at all the other blessings that you have right now because of what? That man and your God. The young. So ready to quit. Don't you think I thought about quitting your daddy? But every time I got shook, I went right back to the Bible, back to the Word, prayed it on out. And then I went back to my husband. And when did you have to stop running back to the Bible about Daddy? When I buried him, baby. Hey there, Mama Sabina! Hey, love! Y'all eating biscuits? You know what I said to God during my prayers last night? I said, "Lord, show me the way." "Show me what I need on this final day of the most important week of our lives." And then you know what he did? Lee-Curtis, you know, he wanted a little more oomph. So, this is it, right? This is the statement. This is, "He is risen." One time, I broke my toe. I didn't think I was gonna be ready for one of our services. It was a women's ministry. I prayed. It was the baby toe. There's no cast. And I was in heels in, I'd say, 48 hours? So I've seen miracles. The Lord, ladies and gentlemen, is the be-all and end-all of your eternity. - Yes, he is. - And eternity... Oh, yeah! Uh, what? What? - First one. First one. - That's one. Yes! - God loves you. - Yes, he does. - God loves you, baby. - God loves you. - ♪ Well, God loves you ♪ - ♪ God loves you ♪ - ♪ God loves you ♪ Yes! - Yo! That's two! - Two. That's two. All right. All right. All right. - We bumping for Jesus over here. - Bump for Jesus, everybody. - Come on, now. - ♪ Hallelujah ♪ - Harlem shake. - ♪ Lord Jes... ♪ - - For the Lord. That's right. That's right, my sister. He got tears coming down his eyes but a smile on his face. We should all be like that for the Lord. We should all be so grateful. I see him! - Yes! Amen! Praise God. Praise God. You ain't ready! You ain't ready! The only place you need to be in a rush to go to is heaven up above. Ain't nothing on this plane of any importance. Hello. Hey, come on, now. Trin. - Hey, Trin. - Huh? Hey, baby, look, um, we haven't been getting all that many beeps as of late, and I think, uh, well, I got an idea for something bigger to really get these folks' attention. Well, wasn't that what our dear friend Jesus was here for, hon? Jesus is real great, and it was a brilliant idea, baby. And he was a huge help getting folks hyped for Sunday. It's just... I'm talking about sealing this thing up with a bang, right? Putting on a real performance. - Show them that we back... - Mm-hmm. And we better than ever and that we are serious about saving their everlasting souls. But maybe something like... No. No. You cannot be serious. It would be outstanding, baby! We got to draw them back in, Trin. Make them remember what they were missing. This is it, baby. This is what we need. - I... - Trin, this right here... this is ego. You know what ego is? That is edging God out. And that's what you're doing right now. Now, are you really gonna be the barrier that keeps me from saving souls?! Hey, Trin, look at me. You look at me now, okay?

Young broke niggas your weakness? I needed you back then, man. I really did. It's fucking stupid, I know. I didn't realize it wasn't just me. - That's... - I wasn't the only one walking around with brand-new shoes and a Camaro? Huh? That's that shit. That's that shit you do to... This city don't need you, man. We've all been doing really good without you. Nobody needs you. Nobody needs your suits. Nobody needs your fucking green screen backdrops of the Last Supper. We don't need it. Shut up! Shut the... Shut up. You watch the way you talk to me, boy. I still got a lot of good to do in this world. A lot of souls to be saved. I saved myself. Now, I don't know about all that other stuff that you was talking about, but what I do know is that I did try to save you. I really did. Now, you... you may be beyond me. You may be beyond what I can do for you. Wait! Fuck you, nigga. How do you know if you're standing in the way of your own blessings? See, sometimes you got to step aside so the Lord can show up and work for you. Hey, Trin! Hey, babe, can you give me another battery, please? This thing seems to be going out on... Trin? Trin? Trinitie! No. No. She's fine. Besides all that, what happened over there... That's not what this is about. That's not why you all are here, okay? We've moved on from that. - This is about rebirth... - Stop. And renewal and resurrection from the dead. - Fuck! - That's what this is about. All right, that's it now. We are done. Because I'm here, baby. And I'm not going anywhere. I said I am done, so take it, do with it what you will because I am done! You came, you silently judged, you poked, and you got it, didn't you? You got what you came for, so just leave. - Jesus Christ! No. - Trinitie. Let's get ourselves together here. - No, no, no, no, no. - Okay? - Not now. No! - Hey, it's o... okay. - Not now! Not you! - Trinitie. - I am serious, Lee-Curtis. - Do not touch me. - Okay. Okay. Do not even breathe near me right now. - I won't. What do you all want from me? Huh? All of you, what the fuck do you want? You want it on the record? Is that it? Is that, is that, is that what you want? Okay, fine. Fine. Yes, there was a point in my marriage where I did not think that we could reconcile our differences. There it is. Every last one of those people out there... We were there for them. We helped them. We spiritually nurtured them and guided them to Christ. Now they want us to fail. They want us to fail. Can you believe that? You can. Sure, you can. Don't think for one moment that I haven't known what you were up to from the second that you stepped foot in this church. You came to show the big bad wolves who eat up all the little piggies. Well, guess what. Those are not little piggies out there! I am! Right here! I am the victim! Why don't you just... leave? Why would you ask her something like that? So she speaks. Look at that. You-you broke your little fly-on-the-wall code, huh? What are you even doing here, Anita? Hmm? Why are you even here? I'm just showing this city and this culture. I want to understand you and Lee-Curtis, and... I want to understand the truth. Yeah? Well, that is bullshit if I have ever heard it. "Why don't you just leave?" Blah, blah, blah. Is that it? Come on, girl. Is that all you got? Because those kinds of questions are not gonna get you to any real truth. Trust me. I have asked them. You... and you... and you... and you... and all those folks out there who are gonna see this... I want them to know that I did what I was supposed to do. I prayed, I knelt, and I was good. So, yes, this is mine. This is... this is my church. And that is my husband. And I would sooner kill him than leave him. Hey, water, water. - Water. - Come get your water. - Water. Water. Water. - Water. Water. Water. Ah, come get you some. I got you. - Oh, yeah. - Appreciate it. We used to sell right next to that big church. The let-out was prime. All them folks hot and thirsty after sitting in that hot-ass sanctuary for hours. Dang, they-they opening back up for real? Man, that would be very, very good for business. Folks ain't been out that way in a minute. Do you think that they have a good chance at drawing a crowd today? Man... I-I mean, it's still a little early, you know. Look-it here, look-it here. - Hello. - Culpeppers looking sharp. It's so good to see... How many you thinking, baby? Well, at least five. That's for sure. Ah, the old reliables don't count. You know, I'm thinking maybe a smooth 500. You know, I don't want to be overconfident, but, uh... If I had to go based on the word on the street and my gut... Trinitie... I'm not so sure the hat is a good idea, baby. I'm really not. You know, folks are gonna want to see us looking spectacular, you know, confident. And, uh, well, the hat might hurt us just a little bit. Trin? Please? The last day of the cameras, you know. Final chapter of our book. Could you... Lee-Curtis... there's gonna have to be a line between some things you say to me and some, like this hat, that you keep to yourself or between you and your God. Okay? Well, "ah-men" to that, then. Have you guys discussed what happened yesterday - and how it might affect you... - Uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh-uh. No, no, no, no. We are moving forward. Like I have been saying from the beginning, we are starting over brand-new. That's right, baby. That is so right. Ah. - Trinitie. - Hmm? Look. Baby, look. There. Right there. You see that? - That, uh, Mustang there? - Hmm. See, I told ya. This is what I mean! This is the goddamn comeback, baby! We just love preaching together. I mean, one day, God just called us to it, told us that, as a team, we could reach far beyond our deepest prayers, and... Did you know Wander to Greater Paths was opening back up today? Uh... You know what? I-I don't think that we knew that Wander to Greater Paths was opening back up today. Now, they seem pretty sold on-on Easter. To be honest, we were, too. But, um, we prayed on it, and-and we came to the conclusion... Mm-hmm. That they needed Easter, not us. So we moved it. - If we had known... - Mm. Lord, we would have never. We wish them nothing but the best and pray that they flourish - and can keep it together. - Amen. God's got 'em. But, uh, just in case the devil is too big of a beast to wrestle and they ever feel the need to step back again... Heaven's House will be right there - to pick everybody up. - Mm. - Believe that. - Amen. Oh, man. Whoo! Mm-hmm. They here for me. They here for Pastor Lee-Curtis Childs. Yes, they are. Yes, they are. Ah, see, I told you. This is what I mean. This is the goddamn comeback, baby! Praise his name! Thank you, Jesus! - Praise his name! - Amen! - Praise his name! - Amen! You are all God's! Hallelujah! Praise his name! We thank you, God! Amen! - We worship you, God! - Amen! Amen. Glory be to him. - Hallelujah! - Hallelujah! Mm-hmm. They here for me. Yes, they are. They here for Pastor Lee-Curtis Childs. Ah. Yes, they are. Yeah. They here for me. They here for these blessings. And I'm gon' give it to 'em. We gon' give it to 'em. Mm-hmm. You and me, baby. And the Lord. Ain't that right? Trin. Baby. I said, isn't that right? Trinitie. Baby, can you...?
