"I've been a hypocrite, and may continue to be. "One can't enjoy what is good without accepting everything else. "I still haven't been able to do that." -Izumi September 2035 About the Pink Sky Hmm... Maybe I'll keep it. Officer, stupid as usual? Shouldn't have said that. "Out on patrol"? I see... 300,000 yen... Oops, grass. 300,000 yen... Why so much? What's it for? Rich neighborhood. Huge homes. Admirable... Despicable... Admirable... Despicable... It's huge. Huh? "Sato Koju" Sato Koju? Not this one. Nah. Not this one either. No. Nope. No... Where is it? Found it. "Sato Koju becomes head of Horse Racing Association of Chiba" Oops. Oh well. Izumi, your line's pulling. What? Oh... Too bad. Unusual for you to miss it. Are you already on fall break? No, I overslept so I ditched school. Bad girl. You smell like alcohol. That's funny. I'm sober. I can't afford alcohol anyway. Work then. It's a weekday, old man. I wish I could. It's so hard to get work these days. You won't get any here. Don't be mean. You adults have to hold up society. It'll be my turn some day, of course. You're right. You okay, old man? I thought I could do better. I leased new expensive machines but there's no work. Well, the lease is up today. A printer can't work without a machine. I'm officially finished. Are you serious? Why would I lie to you? You're a fool. I'm only a high schooler. Yeah, you're right. I was just kidding. Yeah right. Here you go. You need the money. What's this? Just open it. I shouldn't. Open it! Where did you get this? Don't remember. Yes you do. What is this? I found it. You should take it to the police. Don't worry, it's dirty money anyway. 300,000 yen would help you, right? But we shouldn't. Look inside. There's a receipt of some clothing store, probably in Tokyo. 50,000 yen for clothes. That's a year's supply for your whole family. That's true... But this is wrong. Let's take it to the police. Just take it. -But we should... -It's okay. Your line's pulling. Oh. Izumi, wait. Keep the bait. Thanks. I mean... Izumi. I want a bird... A deer? Damn. Wait up Izumi. Go away, you stink. I'm not drinking. Whatever. Listen Izumi. Don't you get it, dummy? The money's ripped off from the citizens. You've labored hard enough. You deserve it. Listen, just lend me 200,000 yen. I'll pay you back. No, take it. No no no... Take this IOU I made. Thank you so much Izumi. Shitty handwriting. I'll pay you back. We'll take it back to the owner then. I really appreciate it. Will 200,000 yen do? Yes, I appreciate it. So you were really broke. Yeah, well. no... Take it all. No, I shouldn't take more than I need. It'll help my company go on. I'm gonna work hard. Let's return the money later. Man to man promise. I'm not a man. Fine, return it to me later. I don't want you to tell anyone about this. Okay. My wife will dump me if she knows. I don't want rumors to spread that I borrowed money from a teenager. Too much pride. It's not like that. For good or for worse, I'll protect your pathetic little pride. Thank you bro. It's all good. I kind of feel sorry for you. You sure? One more time. It's all good. Once more. It's all good. One more! It's all good. Huh? Idiot! Idiot! -Izumi's... -An idiot! Hey! -Boo. -Hey, Hasumi. Not Hasumi, idiot. Name change again? Yasuko? No, idiot. -Satsuki? -Nope, idiot. How about Mei? Idiot! Then what? Think, idiot. Kenta, you idiot! Not Kanta. Call me Haruko, idiot. So you're Haruko now, idiot. It's a luckier name, idiot. I see, idiot. I'm going with Haruko, idiot. My neighbor's an idiot. You talking about me? It's not blinking, by the way. I'm an idiot! It blinked. The title of idiot is yours. -Where's Kaoru, idiot? -She's gonna be late, idiot. Let's go then idiot. Okay, idiot. -Been a while, idiot. -Yeah, idiot. Stop, it hurts. Worthless article. Fall break starts tomorrow but I have team practice everyday. No fall break for me. Then quit. It's not that easy. I'm a starter, so I can't just quit. How about some sympathy? Nope. -No? -Nah. -Really? -Yeah. You're so mean. Why don't you quit and join me? The "freedom club." You mean the "lazy club?" It's fun. My school requires you to be in some club. No one's in "lazy club" like you. Oh. I don't have anything to do even if I quit. What do you usually do after school? Usually? Hmm... What am i doing? Taking a nap? Nah. -Kaoru's here. -She's late. Good afternoon. Hey, idiot. Sorry. Idiot? I couldn't ditch practice. The seniors are too strict. Can I have water? Sure. See, all schools are the same. But Kaoru doesn't do clubs. What? Did you quit the track team? No. See? You lied. I can see the future, you're gonna quit soon. Huh? Why? You look like you'll quit. What? You're crazy. Hasumi, what's going on here? Her name is Haruko now. Got it, Haruko. You're too nice. -Yup -Yeah. 3,650 yen, please. That's a lot. We ordered a lot. I'm full. My treat today. Why? I was late and my new job's... Thanks, I'm broke now. No problem. My job... Huh? Take it from there. What's this? It's all good. -Huh? -No worries, girls. Let's just split it. I'll treat you poor girls. Huh? Seriously, it's on me. Cut it out. Why are you paying? Annoying. You suck. You suck, too. And a pink glove? Think you're a pro? -Isn't this nice? -Whatever. Kaoru's next. We should take it to the police. I will. Now. I will eventually. Huh? In the future. That's not good. The finder gets 10% anyway. -Yup. -No. How much was inside? Not telling. Tell us shorty. No way, you giant. What? What are you doing? Get off. Wow, a wad of cash! One, two, three...100,000 yen. No way. Ooh, a student ID... Hey, he's cute. Really cute! It's his wallet? Really? Let me see. He's not bad looking. A year older, I guess. And his high school's the best one around. Yuck. A high schooler with this much cash? -Rich kid. -Yeah. A rich kid with dirty money. He's so cute, there's no way it's dirty money. What's this? It's complicated... Hey, look at this. Wow, 50,000 yen. Izumi, you spent 50,000 yen on clothes in Tokyo? Clothes? Yeah. No, I didn't use it. This guy did. You liar. Well... Shady, you used 50,000 yen. Guys. Can't return this to him now. You mean police? Why police? We know the owner. But Kaoru said... Shut up! If we take it to the police they'll contact Sato. He'll notice money is missing and we'll be suspected. Nah. They'l find out you used the money. Your fingerprints will be taken and you'll get caught. Then lets keep it. I feel sorry for Sato. But... I still feel sorry for him. Let's keep it. I want to meet him. What? When my parents went into debt, we couldn't have decent dinner for weeks. Sato's rich. I can't stand him being starved. Based on your rules, this incident is a minus 10. Give me the wallet. No way. I put my own things in it. Here. And the receipt for 50,000 yen. There's nothing else. Give it back. Don't touch me. Kaoru's turn. Okay. Not in here. Welcome. Balance: 964 yen Sorry Kaoru, I'm broke. It's okay. I'll take care of it. Sorry. No worries, my job's going well. A new part time job? I told you yesterday. -Yeah, you did. -This job... Oh. I remember now. The wallet... No. Again. I haven't said anything yet. I'll get money. Thanks. Welcome. Four, five. One, two, three, four... Stop counting. What? Four, five.... Hey, let me see the wallet. No. Haruko darling. Pretty please Pretty no. I really have something in it. No, I checked yesterday. Did you? Don't you trust me? You're a thief, write an IOU later. Fine, I will. You really didn't find anything? No! What's in it anyway? A small paper. Don't see any paper. Don't. No paper. See? No touching. See? Did I lose it? Maybe, 'cause you're an idiot. I'm such a nice person to skip club and be here for you. You only wanted to meet Sato. You're an idiot. Kaoru, let's go without Izumi. I'll tell him I found it. He might kiss me. Nah, you'll just get 10,000 yen maybe. I'm just kidding. I'll use the money for a date with him. No, you have to pay me back first. I was just kidding. Hey, wait! Let's run. They're too fast. It's here. We're here. It's huge. His house takes up the whole block. How come you know his place? This area's famous. How do you know the exact place? I have good eyes. Do you? -Let's ring the bell. -Wait... Do you think he's home? Well, fall break just started. So? I don't know but hope he's home. Stop! That'll give him a bad impression. Huh? You're annoying. You're the annoying one with all these names. I'm Haruko now. Stop, he'll hear you. Who is it? Hi, are you Sato Koki? Yeah, so? What now? Hasumi, I mean Haruko. Uh, we found your wallet... and came to return it to you. Here. Take it. What's this? 10% is the rate, right? But it's too much. This is more than 10%. No, it's not. It's not... Thank you so much. We have to go now, so bye! Bye. Wait, I'm Ono Hasumi. I'm in high school and... Hurry up! Hey! I'm walking backwards. Let go! Wait up. He thinks we're money mad now. We should take it before he changes his mind. That's not the point. What's the point? It's about how I look to him. Who cares? Huh? Hey. I'm gonna take this. I don't owe you. Don't call me Hasumi. You told him you're Hasumi. No, I didn't. -You did, right Kaoru? -Yeah. Anyway, he's rich and generous. 10,000 yen for each. I don't think so. Shut up. Guys, I'll take the money. He was so cute. Way better than the photo. Think he'll call me? Call you? I put my name and e-mail in the wallet. Izumi might've ruined it for me, though. You shouldn't have. Why not? You'll look... desperate. I go to a girls' school. We never meet boys. Especially not cute guys like Sato. Now finish your IOU. I see. Stop it. I envy you Kaoru, your school is co-ed. No cute boys, though. Quality matters. Hasumi, you're cute enough. Seriously? Yup. How's this? Sign it. Sign? To show who borrowed the money. Right. Who's cuter, Izumi or me? Hmm, my type is Izumi. Fine. Here. Good. What's this? Plus 10. Smells good. Hello. Sato. What time do you get off? I need to speak to you. Well, what? There's 150,000 yen missing. What? I had 300,000 yen in my wallet. Oh, you did. First I thought somebody took it before you guys found it. Who'd take the money and then turn in the wallet? But... What? Take a look. Nothing special. Okay. Look carefully. Not the money. Oh. See it? An IOU to you for 200,000 yen. That's wierd. Isn't it. The world's full of mystery. Is Hasumi your friend? Not my type but she's nice. Who's your type? Don't change the subject. She told me you owe her 50,000 yen. The reciept's probably for this jacket. I don't owe her money. I should have 270,000 yen, right? 300,000 minus 30,000 I gave you guys. Forget about the 30,000. I don't want to be cheap. Okay. But I only have 120,000. What's 270 minus 120? Hey. Cut it out. I'm worth more than 150,000 yen. I just want the money. Who did you lend it to? And you need a signature on an IOU. There's none here. So, this IOU is invalid. Nice, you don't get the money back. No, it means you pay. Let's go and get the money back. No. -Why? -I can't. -Who has it? -Can't tell. -Who is it? -I won't tell you. Is it Hasumi? -Why her? -Then who? Not telling. -Tell me. -No. I'll tell your parents. Unbelievable. That's very lame. Go ahead, you sissy. Give me back at least some. I don't have any. What the hell. I just want my money back. What can I do? Get the money back. He'll pay back. When? Eventually. I'm going to the police. I will. What? Hey! Take care of my gloves and shoes, will ya? Lame lame lame... -What're you doing? -It blinked. See, emotion makes a difference. Does it mean something? Not really. I'll go turn myself in. Okay, wait. Stop. Say I'm sorry. What? Can't hear you. Sorry. By chance I found Dad's secret savings. There was a pile of money so I took some. But he'll notice I stole from him if you go to the police. I don't want to make a big deal. You listening? Dirty money getting dirtier. Huh? Why don't you take it again? Money stolen from the citizens. He changed the hiding place. Why is it dirty money? You don't know your Dad's job? Your dad, Sato Koju is a corrupt politician. What? My hunch proved right. It's odd for you to have that much money. Thought it's for cram school tuition but turns out your father's corrupt. I knew it was shady money. Well, I'll pay you back...eventually. Dirty money is still money. It's a universal rule, for some reason. Feeling bold? Yup. I wanted to buy a video camera. That's nice. Not asking why? Not interested. Actually... Here's our order. No thanks. Okay. Enjoy. There's someone who's been hospitalized for a long time. Hasn't been outside for months so I want to show what's outside. Isn't it romantic? I guess. If it's dirty money I can at least use it for good. I guess. I want to make the person happy. Understand? You're full of yourself. What's with you? I want to do it for Kazumi. It's not for me. It's for love. Not bad. But you ruined the whole plan. Hey, you lost the wallet. There's still enough money for a camera. Shut up, I just wanted to buy a better camera than others. So lame. And why show this ugly world to a sick person? Look. Minus 21...? Scribbling? No, that's today's paper. Add up my scores. Wait a sec. Forgot to do one. Minus 10. "Temp workers go on strike." Isn't this good news? The weak working together to fight the company. It's their fault for being shortsighted. But society and economy change with time. No, it's all up to you. I'm gonna make it minus 25. Strange theory. Here, add it up. What for? Do it in your head. There's so many, I can't. You're really stupid. The world is full of negativity. Told ya. Minus 524... Your criteria are really biased but there's so much negative news. No wonder life isn't easy. Shut up, rich boy. Give back the money. Not happening. How about making our own newspaper? Huh? It's a good idea. You make it. Huh? I'll forget about the money you owe me. You read papers everyday anyway. Should be easy. No chance. A paper with only good news that'll satisfy negative folks like you. That's brainwashing, like the communists. This is for personal use. You good at computers? Not really. Use a computer and make a good one. I must be a genius. Kazumi's gonna love me for this. I have a job all through fall break. It's not my problem. It is actually. So, make it work. I'll do it if you take care of this. What's this? Pay it, so I can quit my job now. What's this sloppy writing? "Miss Kaoru, I owe you 20,000 yen." This is an IOU. A copy of it. The price of losing your wallet. Wait, I gave you 30,000 already. Giving 20,000 more means a 50,000 loss. Fine, I'll tell your Dad. "I'm sorry I found your stupid son's money and lent it. I'll work to pay you back." Okay, I'll pay. One more thing. Now what? I'm the chief editor. Sure, I don't care. And one more. What? I'll need help. Mind using your charm to get me help? Huh? Kaoru, here's the money I owe you. How'd you get it so fast? Found a new job. Okay, thanks. Sure. I forgot your IOU today. Huh? I'll shred it later. Thanks. It skipped five times. Not even twice. I can see your panties. I'm wearing shorts. It's ugly. You wear wool underwear! How about this rock? Looks a bit big but I'll try. Nice splash. So what's going on? What? Tell us. I might go out with Sato. Seriously? I've been talking with him. I even met him. -Wow, that's great. -Isn't it? That's all? Why aren't you surprised? I am, but I thought you had something more, Haruko. Well I do, but call me Hasumi. Sato calls me Hasumi. Who cares, what's the news? You're rude. Not gonna tell you. Sorry, I was just curious. I'll forgive you. And? Sato wants us to make a newspaper. Whoa! -You're freaking me out. -You're overreacting. I was surprised. I just didn't expect it. Yeah, but what's it about? Maybe something with only good news? How did you know? I'm right? Yeah, how'd you know? Maybe because Izumi scores the paper everyday. Yeah, Kaoru, you're so right. Why make a paper anyway? Listen, it's a sweet story. -Is it... -Is it what? Is it to help his father? No, you missed this time. Darn. His best friend, a boy, is ill. Forgot the disease name. -Oh, thanks. -No trouble. He's in the hospital for a while so Sato wants to cheer him up with a paper. Isn't it a good friendship story? Wait a sec. Let me finish. Sato's the chief editor... Why is he the chief editor? Because this paper is made of Sato's pure friendship. I'll be the deputy editor and Kaoru will be the proof reader. Izumi, you're the writer-photographer. I have to write and take pictures? I have the hardest job. You're kidding me! No I'm not. This is the editor's order. His? Yeah, to have you do everything. What? I told him everything. That you found the wallet. That I told you to give it back, and put up the money. I wanted to be honest. I know. Huh? It was Kaoru who paid. Kaoru, please. It's like a charity but please help. Okay, but I have clubs and jobs. But it's an everyday job. Everyday? News to me. Sure, I only told you now. I can't do it everyday, it's too much work. Kaoru, don't you think so? Well, but sounds fun. I'll give it a shot. You're my best friend. It might be a good experience. Thank you. I'm excited. Thank you so much. Izumi, you don't have to do it. I will. What's with your attitude? I'm happy to help. Say sorry. Sorry. Sorry Miss Hasumi. Great, thanks. Izumi, what's your new job? You hypocrite, you suck. That was not the deal. I told you to make them help me, but working everyday and you being chief? You took 150,000 yen from me. You should do it. If not, I'll tell Hasumi you lent 200,000 yen to someone. I'm sure she'll go after this person for me. I'm okay with the daily work, but why are you the chief? I started it, so I should be the editor. Work hard, bye. Wait. What? And you... Hello... Huh? Nothing. I hate the way you made up the friendship story. It's all just to impress your girlfriend. You stupid hypocrite! Shut up. Hypocrite, hypocrite... Stop shouting. Stop trying to make yourself look good, jerk. Nobody would help me for free if they knew it's for love. This is what you wanted and you got your extra 20,000 yen. Work hard, bye. Hey, wait... -Idiot. -Hey! Son of a... politician. Damn him! What time is it? 8:32am. 8:30, good. Izumi's going news hunting now, writes it by 3pm, and Kaoru proofs it. Gotcha. I take it to Sato by 6pm. Perfect. Nice. Oh, I named our group. With thanks to your friendships. What is it? Got a darker pen? Here you go. "Girl..." Don't look. Ta-da. "Women's Girls' Club." Sweet, thanks. But what for? We're a newspaper editorial. It represents our friendship. That's nice. Right? Thanks for the pen. Sure. Let's start. Okay. -Here. -Yeah. Now get going. Faces...faces... Where can I find them? Anything... A bird? Good. Definently looked like a bird. Ouch. Flash... Will keep it for back up. Crying face? Crying face? More like bawling. That's plenty. "Like this, our town...this town... "...has many faces. Why not walk around and look from different angles? "You might find something out of the ordinary." Reading too fast. I can't keep up. Sorry. You type way faster than me. I use it in my job. Huh? Didn't I tell you about my job? Nope. Look. This is it. What is it? You get paid to do video chats. 50 yen per minute to chat with men. Is it sexual? So far it's not. It's an all night job, so I have no time for sleep. But it pays well. Yup. Now back to work. Okay. "Like this, our town..." We finished that. Then from where? 50 yen per minute, means 5,000 for 100 minutes. It's 150,000 yen for 3,000 minutes. Yeah. Kaoru, teach me how to do it. I can't. Please, pretty please. I can't. But I want to. No. They screen out minors. I had to use my sister's ID. I don't have a sis. Let's finish, Hasumi's waiting. Wear contact lenses. "Why not walk around..." You're so slow. Sorry. Shut up, you didn't do anything. Huh? You have no right to complain. You shut up. You didn't work that much. Huh? Kaoru did most of it. You don't know how hard it is. to find original news. I worked so hard. Shut up. It's better if I do it. I'm better with computers. But Sato... It's better to tell Sato she worked hard. He'll have a better impression of you. You're right. Sorry Izumi. Forgive me. Okay. What time is it? It's... Never mind, let's run. Hurry. Wait, hey. Not again... This... Doesn't really look like a paper. Okay. Then what does it look like? Maybe a page of a magazine. -You're right. -Yes. Makes it look better. It has to look decent. Okay. Find better news around this area. Hot stuff like a new shop opening or a newborn kitty. Something that makes you want to leave the hospital. Aha. Is that good news? Of course, it's cheerful. Oh. What's with this Girls' Club? That's... Get rid of it. It's nonsense. -What... -True, it's nonsense. -What? -Right? I need fresh daily news to bring everyday. We'll dump this kid, Koki. I mean... Sato. I'll keep it just in case. Do you have the data? Sure, Kaoru has it. Yeah. Here. Thanks. What? Oh, nothing. A kitten? You're kidding me. Who does he think he is? We're not making a kid's paper. Jerk! Fucker! What's she talking about? No idea. I don't understand Izumi, do you Kaoru? I don't know. What's the big deal? Why are you defending Sato? He turned down our club name, too. You liked that? -Well... -Nonsense. You're a jerk too. I can't take it anymore. I quit. Kaoru, let me learn your job. But you're a minor. Shut up, so are you. I'll use Mom's ID. I've had enough. Fine, quit. -Hasumi. -Who cares. Oh yeah? Fine, I quit. -Izumi. -Leave her alone. You look like a teenager. I'm a housewife. We don't take teenagers. I'm a housewife with spare time. People say I have a baby face. Do you have ID? Drivers license or something? Do you need it? Hold on. Sure. Honey, where's my ID? Oh, here it is. Excuse me. I couldn't really see it. Oh, sorry. Still can't see it. You should respect my privacy. Our site supports that. Show me the support then. You mean? You look like you don't trust me. We have to trust each other to build a healthy relationship. Hasumi, I'm so sorry. My bad. I went over the edge. I'll help you. I'll support you. I'm really really sorry. Is this a restaurant? I think. It's new? Maybe. It is. I'll take pics. Okay. It's Italy, right? The flag. Restaurants usually have today's specials, don't they? -Yeah, they do. -Yup. Can we eat for free if it's for a story? I doubt it, we're high schoolers. Let's give it a shot, I'll go. Wait, I'm coming too. What's up? Now? Some street. I don't know, looking for good scenery or something. We should split. Yeah. See you at 4pm. Nice. You. You took my photo? Yes. Delete it. You can delete nowadays, right? Yes. Then erase it. Yes. I did. So embarrassing. Crap. Hey! Coward. We went to many restaurants. How many? Seven. Did you get free meals? No, it cost a lot. Let's have Sato pay for it. No, I shouldn't be biased. Besides, I can afford it. You shouldn't have to pay. It's okay. I don't care. How about you, Izumi? Hey, wait. Ouch. What's this? You haven't taken any pics. The old lady told me to erase it. You're such a bad liar. I'm not lying. Be serious. What old lady? A stranger. What's Koki's type... All right. Bigger size and two side printing is nice. Thanks. I appreciate the restaurant reviews, but they're pretty critical. Okay. We are just trying to be honest. Koki, should I put ginger in the fridge? You can leave it. Okay. I think it's better if we leave the bad ones out. Okay. Hey, how about the beans? Just leave it. Okay. Would you go and get the thing? Yep, sure. Aren't there stories like somebody's job promotion? Is that good news? Of course, you get status and more money. What's merrier than that? Success is success. Like father, like son. Sorry, she has a foul mouth. You've got to work harder. We haven't much time. Give me data just in case. That's wine. I hope you get caught. It's my Dad's. -Here. -Thanks. Hey Koki, what's "the thing?" Never mind, I found it. Oh, okay. How do we find successful businessmen? No idea. Maybe we should look more carefully. I don't know. How about asking out loud "Anybody get a promotion?" -Too embarrassing. -True. Anybody get a promotion? Shh. Shut up! No one's putting their hands up. What to do? My dad's not getting one, neither are my neighbors... Koki wasn't tall in elementary school. So what? I can't imagine him as a boy. How do stores like these succeed? Hmmm. Like opening new shops or making the shops bigger? Not sure, let's ask. Nice, how about that one? Okay. Give me a notebook. Pen, too? Thanks. Hello. Hi. Can I help you? Sir, what do you consider a success? Success? Yes. Success... Money? Selling lots of flowers? Getting women? Money and women maybe. Money and women. Lame. Is it? It's so blatant. Honesty is important. Seriously? I think it's cool. You like middle-aged men? No, I was talking about Hasumi. She's really into Sato. She'll never get him, though. That's mean. Oh, sorry. She's working so hard. You'd normally be too embarrassed to do that. True, sorry. I preferred you before, but I like Hasumi better now. Never say that again. Okay. Much better. Thanks. But we need variety. How about the economy? Like, only stocks on the rise. Okay. Nice. Huh? How about sports? Maybe soccer players playing abroad? Post updates when they play well. -That's so... -Good idea. We can google it. Yeah. What if the web's wrong? Never mind. That's not our fault. Let's find cheerful news from actual newspapers. That's stealing. So smart, Koki. We'll revise it for tomorrow. Just e-mail me. No need to bring it. It's no trouble. Nah, but let's meet up sometimes, just the two of us. You and me? I'll e-mail you then. We can continue even after school starts. Yeah. Are we gonna continue this after fall break? Of course we are. I quit the team. Why? I'm working more to earn money for news research. I like journalism. It's like my future goal now. He should pay for expenses. I really don't mind. Did you hear he didn't like yesterday's articles either? Again? He says too much school stuff. Heck, that's our lives. You always ditch, though. Have you met Hasumi lately? No, only over the phone. She was depressed over his feelings. He doesn't meet her so she's worried he might not like her. Huh. I wonder if he really likes Hasumi. Doesn't sound good. What's not good? Never mind. Gotta go hunt for news, bye. Where to? Hi, this is Sato. Your call is being forwarded... Hi, this is Sato. Your call is being forwarded... Hey, you got Hasumi worried... Hi, this is Sato. Your call is being forwarded... Hi, this is Sato. Your call is being forwarded... Voice mail... darn. Hello? Hi, I make newspapers with Koki. Oh, hi. Koki's not back yet. Okay, thank you. I'm sorry. Hi, is there a teenage girl named Kazumi here? Doesn't ring a bell. She should be here. Please hold on. Teenage girl, right? No teenage girl. What? Yeah, I'm sure. Any visitor named Sato Koki? Sato? Yes, he's visited. Then she's the one. But it's a boy. Yes, Sato's a boy. No, the one he visited. No, it's a girl. Boy. Girl. Boy. Strange. What's going on? Isn't it a girl? What the...? Huh? Oh, nothing. "Nakamura Kazumi." What? Ouch. Are you okay? Yeah, who are you? Um, where's Sato? I don't know. Okay. Looking for him? Yes. Why don't you take a seat? Okay. You can sit here. Thank you. I'm Nakamura Kazumi. I'm Kawashima Izumi. Isn't the paper fun? Well, yeah. It only has good news. Really? Yup, Koki makes it. Wow. It only looked like a page of a magazine at first. But the head of the hospital liked the whole idea so much. And it's a hospital paper now. Wow. Have you read it? Only the article about the faces in this town. That one's boring. I asked him to replace it with other news. But there's not so many stories so we'll have to wait. Koki, you have a guest. Damn... Why don't you come and sit? Yeah. She wanted to see you. Okay. What do you want? What do you think? Who knows. She's funny. Have her write something. Chance to show your skill as an editor. You're right. You really should. The paper's getting bigger. Interested, Izumi? But my articles would be boring. You never know. Why don't you try? Okay. I'll write an article when I get out. I already decided what to write. Guess what? What? About the pink sky. Is that imaginary? No, it really exists. A pink sky? It's so beautiful. Not orange but pink. The sky getting pink in the late afternoon turning everything into pink. Hands, roads, buildings, everything gets pink. Isn't it beautiful to just imagine all the pink? Can't really imagine, but it must be pretty. But I haven't seen it yet. Oh. I'm gonna make it an article. Pay me good. Deal. I have to go now. Oh, thanks for coming. Write an article some time. Looking forward to it. I'm sorry. Why? I don't know. Well, bye. Bye. Bye. Not saying bye to you. You cold-decker! Don't follow me. Be quiet. It's a hospital. Then get lost. How come you're here? Mind your own business. What's a cold-decker? Look it up in Wikipedia, idiot. I don't need the money anymore. I'll pay you back. And you're g... never mind. What's this about? Be quiet. You used our rejected articles to make your own paper. Sorry, but the hospital wanted to issue it officially. Why didn't you tell us? The girls would be thrilled. Don't want them to be. Why? You almost said it. I have to keep killing the news so you guys don't come here, and... What? They're gonna hire pros and make it monthly instead of weekly. You made it a weekly without even telling us? You bastard. Quiet. That's not the point. I'm saying your guys are fired. Huh? Shut up. Forget the money. I got paid as an honorary editor. You really are a cold-decker. What is that anyway? Look it up yourself. What I gonna tell the girls? Are you g... gay? I mean, are you coming out? What should I do? How should I know? You're the one who dragged them in. You have responsibility. Okay. Wait Mai. I haven't explained anything yet. Sorry, I'm nervous pretending to be a high schooler. Okay. There they are. Those two. Especially the tall one. Tall one on left. Flirt with this asshole in front of 'em. Don't call me that. You're totally funny. Do I sound like a high schooler? A bit weird but okay. Sato, you flirt with her like you mean it. Pay me first. Here. Thanks. Get going. I'm so nervous for real. Cut it out. Fine, I'll quit. Wait, you're really cute. I want your pictures later. Treat her like your lady. I'll be hiding and watching from here. Good luck. You betcha. Let's go Koki. Still a bit wierd... I should have my camera ready. Nice. And expensive. You bastard! Wait Hasumi. Wait up. Take a picture. What did you do? Take the pic, hurry. Later. Now. Where are they? No more newspaper. Yeah. I kind of liked it. Really? Yeah. You can focus on your chat job now. Right. What's the matter? I don't like the job, though. I told you about the debt before. Did you? About my parents' debt. Right. It's still going on. Mom buys too much designer stuff. Wow. So I can't quit the job. Why should you pay for it? My sis is too busy to help... Does your Dad know? No way. They'll divorce if he finds out. Sorry. Never mind. Maybe this was for the best. You're free now. Hm? Hasumi was dumped. This is all over now. That's true. Hasumi, Izumi's here for you. Stop crying. Hey, idiot. Thank you. Drink something warm. Here you go. Izumi, there you are. Ditching school again? You're depressed. Nah. Well, you forgot to return the fishing rod. Take it back for me. Are you okay? I lost something because of you. My fault? I looked for you at your school. Nearly got reported, too. Where is it? Oh, in the car. Follow me. Wait a second. Got it. Here's the money I borrowed. Plus 10,000 yen as a token of my appreciation. You take it. You should take it to the police. Haha. A lot happened while you were getting the money. They don't want the money back anymore. Buy your kid candy or something. How did that happen? It's a long story. How did you do that? Forget about it. You didn't sell your body, did you? It was worse. Sorry for the trouble. This money is yours anyway. Then 10,000 yen more. No thanks. I won't ask what happened, but you deserve this. Take the money for me. How did you get the money? Sold yourself? Who'll buy an old man like me? I'm talking about organs. Oh, organs. Won't be this healthy if I sold it. I got a job. Oh, that's nice. Yes, it is. I got the job from the hospital. It pays good, thanks to you. I needed this money to take the job. Good for you. It's for a stupid newspaper, but a job's a job. It's a silly paper made of good news only. Hypocrisy makes money. Something wrong? I'll give you a lift. No thanks. Hey, Izumi. Fishing rod. Izumi! Leave me. Izumi. Shut up or I'll hate you. Hi, this is Sato. Your call is being forwarded... Hi, this is Sato. Your call is being forwarded... Hello? Hi, this is Sato. Your call is being forwarded... Damn. What the hell? Voice mail again. This isn't my day. I'm home. Pick up the phone, dammit. Hi, this is Sato. Your call is being forwarded... Hi, this is Sato. Your call is being forwarded... Hello? Hi, this is Sato. Your call is being forwarded... Hi, this is Sato. Your call is being forwarded... Voice mail again. Hi, this is Sato. Your call is being forwarded... Finally. I called you so many times yesterday. Hey? You hear me? Bad reception. Sato, do you hear me? I hear you. Then say something. I'm sorry. Huh? I'm sorry. What's going on? Thanks for coming. Was he that sick? But got worse? It wasn't that kind of disease. Then why? He fell off the bed while sleeping and hit his head. They found him on the floor. Kazumi talked about the pink sky. So could you burn this with him? What is it? It creates pink smoke. I brought plenty so the whole area would become pink. Could you ask her, er... his parents? Yeah. Thanks. Don't you have to be inside? Yeah. I'm sorry. For what? For everything. I was the hypocrite after all. I don't get it. I was clueless. I didn't do anything. I don't understand. I'm the stupid one. I only criticized and did nothing. I was the idiot. I overestimated myself. I'm much more stupid than you. I mean... I have to be more empty. Still don't understand. I need to take action. Not sure what, but something. I'm really sorry. Sounds funny. Yeah. Can I ask a question? Did you really love him? Did you sleep with him? Now's not the time. Sorry. It's okay. Want me to kiss you? No way. Creepy. Oh, almost forgot. Here's the 200,000 yen. I told you I don't need it. Can you give it to Hasumi and Kaoru? Consolation for Hasumi and pay for Kaoru. Where'd you get this? I had it returned. I had 20,000 yen extra but I used it for the pink. I never thought you'd really get it back. It was a man to man promise. Are you lesbian? Don't get me wrong. I like men. I want Robert Pattinson to bite me. Me too. Yuck. Kidding, he's not my type. Too much information. You're funny. Not funny, you ass fucker. That's offensive. I know. Really? Yeah. Hey! Smoke... Wow. It might become a pink cloud, don't you think? He's really gone. Kazumi... he's turning into a pink sky. Yeah, he is. Kazumi! Kazumi! Kazumi! Kazumi! Kazumi! Kazumi! Wait... The smoke's gone, but... Gross. Sorry.
