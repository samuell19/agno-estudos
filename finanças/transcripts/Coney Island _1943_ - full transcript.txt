I discovered there's more money in being a sucker than trying to find one. Hey, what are you doing, Frankie? I got a little pitch across the street I want you to see it. I will, maybe tomorrow, huh? Put your arms around me, Honey, hold me tight Huddle up and cuddle up with all your might Oh! Oh! Won't you roll those eyes? Eyes that I just idolize.

Oh, who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder? Nobody spoke... Good evening, gentleman's. The Irish's are the curse of this whole world. - They aren't worth a nick. - Through, through. Defend yourself your spailpin! - Eddie, my boy! - Finnegan! - How the heck guy? - Find me never better. Hey, you look great. Frankie, what kind of a friend is it you are that doesn't tell me that he is here. He just got here this minute. None of your excuses. I should have been notified. You know it's been since the Chicago fair that I last looked upon you, Eddie. That's right. How's the world been treating you? Not often enough. Ah! But here we are, wasting words on an occasion that calls for celebration. You know I'm going to do, Eddie? - You got let him invite you by a drink. - Yes. Now, don't say it as if it wasn't an honor. It's a privilege I reserve only for my friends. And you have no enemies. That is true. I love the world. I'll tell you what I'll do Finnegan. I'll buy you a drink for one chorused of that Mrs. Murphy. Bartender! Finnegan is here. Coming right up! Ah, good old, Mrs. Murphy! Mrs. Murphy gave a party just about a week ago. Everything was plentiful, the Murphy's they're not slow They treated us like gentlemen and we tried to act the same. Only for what happened well it was an awful shame. Now when Mrs. Murphy dished the chowder out she fainted on the spot. She found a pair of overalls at the bottom of the pot. Tim Nolan he got ripping mad, his eyes were bulging out. He jumped upon the piano and loudly he did shout. Oh, who threw the overalls in Mrs Murphy's chowder? Nobody spoke, so he shouted all the louder It's an Irish trick that's true I can lick the mick that threw The overalls in Mrs. Murphy's... chowder - Still have a great voice. - Thank you, thank you. Another one, bartender. - Come on, the boss will see you now. - Oh, good. Keep the change. Oh, uh... Can I leave this bag here for a while? Sure. There you are, Finnegan, this oughta hold you to like it back, huh? Or, I see you're not expecting to be gone long, eh? See you later. What will you be drinking, Frankie? Nothing. Just breathe to my face that'll be enough. Glad to see you. Hello, Joe. Eddie! - This is quite a surprise! - Yeah! Come on over here meet Charlie Fitch. This is Eddie Johnson. - How do you do Charlie? - Glad to know you. What's this? Bird seed for vultures? Why, they see me in this outfit you'd be surprised how many people want to teach me to play cards. - Eddie and me used to work together. - Oh, so he's the one. Yeah! We've been partners and everything from a shooting gallery to a gig show. Once we even had a whole carnival. Didn't we Joe? - Sit down. - Thanks. Well it's been a long while, Eddie. Let's see now where was the last time I saw you? In 10 th of July, two years ago. Room 214, the Lee hotel in Saint Louis. Remember? Yeah! Yeah! Now I remember. I thought you would. We had an argument about how the carnival should be run. So we decided to play a handle poker for the whole works. I won it with three of the prettiest aces you ever saw. That reminds me I've been carrying something ever since. I've been wanting to give it to you. I didn't have a chance. You pulled out in such a hurry. What's that? Just a little something I found the next morning under the cushion of your chair. You know another thing? Counting your three that deck had seven aces. Uh well, look boys. I guess you'll be mostly alone. I can see you two fellas have a lot to talk about. - So long, Joe. - See you later. - Glad to meet you. - Same here. Well? What are you gonna do about it, Joe? Nothing. I figured that makes up for all the times I went to the cash drawer and found your hand in it. Now I think I'll just keep right on forgetting about it. Why don't you do the same thing, Eddie? Oh, I tried Joe. Why I used to spend an hour a day seeing if I could forget. I didn't work. So I finally said to myself you'll never get this out of your crown until you find Joe and get what's coming to you. That's why I'm here. You gonna sue me, Eddie? No. I figured since you were cheating that night we'd just hold the hand. So we're still partners and I own half this joint. Now there's only one trouble. I don't figure the same way. Well in that case I guess I'll just have to worm myself in. I wouldn't try it if I were you, Eddie. Oh, I've got to Joe. If I didn't pay you back why I just wouldn't have any respect for myself. You see I'm the kind that... Yeah? Joe, I just want to show you my dress. Oh! I didn't know you were busy. That's all right honey, he's leaving. Oh... Kate Farley, Eddie Johnson. - Hello. - How do you do, Miss. Farley. I just want you to see my costume for my new number, like it? Yeah! It looks like a million, hey Eddie? I guess you molding it out of your nice dress. if I were wearing a suit like that, I certainly wouldn't talk about clothes. I don't know. If you were wearing a suit like this I think it would be an improvement. Uh, never mind him, honey. He's always joking. Come on, Eddie, push off. You won't change your mind about my proposition, Joe? Sorry no dice. Suit yourself. The show's running a little long. You think Iought to cut out my second chorus. If it's anything like your other number, I'd cut out the first chorus too. Listen you apple knocker. I've had just about enough of you. And when you take that thing off you'd better hang it up in a bird cage. It's liable to fly away. The big mouth what does he think he is talking to me... Ah now take it easy, honey. Why, tell me this is no good. I picked it out myself. Who is he, anyway? Oh he's just the guy I used to hang around with. Oh, a plow jockey. He just does no style when he sees it. Why, of course. Not now forget about it, will you? Come on now where's that smile. Yeah, that's better. Say, they got some fresh lobsters in over the Grotto. How about helping me tie into a couple after the show. Well I can't pass up fresh lobsters. Good. I'll pick you up in the dressing room. All right see you later. Hurry, hurry, hurry! Let's see how! Josephine, the tatoo woman! Every inch in this body, included the hair It's covered with a genuine reproduction of an artistic masterpiece. How are you friend, glad to see it. Come and see the leaning Tower of Pisa and the mall Josephine pence. There more it leans. You'll see Gainsborough's blueberry talking things over with whistler's mother. We give away a five gold dollar piece with every cent admission. As an added attraction I'll cut my throat. Would anybody give a dime to see that? Very funny. I'm starving and you're grinning. Frankie I've been trying to tell you. Listen to me and you'll be rolling in dough. Why don't you leave me alone? But I've got an idea for a pitch that's worth a fortune. Then take my advice don't tell anybody. Open up a place for yourself. Well I've tried. Looked all morning all the good locations are taken. This would be an ideal spot for it, Frankie. Hurry! Hurry! The only tattooed woman on the street. And every time she shakes, moving pictures. If you're smart, you'll listen to me. Look, Eddie, you're a sweet fellow. You're a fine boy but I haven't got time for you. I'm trying to make a buck for myself. Go back to the walnut shells and the peas, will you? All right, friends, this little lady is not a freak, she's an educated... Look, here's a sketch I made. We could make the change over in a couple of days. Now that's the way the front would look. Say, where did you get this idea? Thought of it last night. We could fix it or for less than 300. Oh, I see, the 300, that's where I come in. Oh, come on kid... I've got the money too all you put in is this location in your time. - All you want is my time in this location? - That's right. How about it? Eddie, you just made yourself a deal. After six months with Josephine, even suicide looks good to me. Come on. Let's have a beer and talk it over. Hurry, hurry, hurry! It only cost 10 cents to see this darn exhibit which was brought to this country at the staggering cost of 280.000 dollars. What you see before you folks is just a sample of what's waiting for you on the inside. You'll gasp at the incomparable beauty of the ten genuine turkish harem girls. You're thrilled at the breathtaking extravaganza entitled a night in a turkish harem. And that ain't all folks you'll see a young turkish maiden sold to the sultan for pieces of silver. And finally my friends you're going to hear the authentic primitive music of Turkistan. As played by Abu Mandeb. A genuine native of mysterious Constantinople. Sahib. - A genuine native. - That's Frankie, ain't it? Dolly, here's where I get even. Abu neither speaks nor understands a bit of english. But how he can play those weird, and difficult cadences of his world famous native music. Listen folks, just listen to that melodious melody. Hello, Frankie. Hello, honey, glad to see you. Now there you are, ladies and gentlemen. That just goes to show you how intelligent these turks are. Why, this man arrived in our country only two days ago and already he speaks a few words of the english language. Now I wonder how many of you people out there after only two days or 48 hours in Constantinople could say uh... Which means, "hello honey glad to see you", in turkish. Ha-ha it's about as turkish as that indian blanket he's sitting on. And now lady will you please move along? You see, Abu here comes from a very fine family. And according to native tradition he's not allowed to converse with anyone so obviously beneath him. That's funny he used to talk to me plenty when we were working together... (speaking gibberish) All right, Abu. All right I'll ask her. Young lady, Abu can't figure out why you're wearing that atrocity on your head. He wants to know did you lose an little bet or did you just fall in a fruit salad. Hurry, hurry, hurry, folks. The show starts in exactly three minutes. Goodbye, sweetheart! Hey, you'll see ten lovely maidens, and all their unadorned beauty. And when I say unadorned, folks, I mean unadorned. - I should have slapped his face. - I don't know why you didn't. Hello, honey. Listen, if you don't tell that pal yours to stop ragging me I'm gonna bust a bottle over his head. You know what he just did. He... Where is everybody? That's what we've been trying to figure out. Well, the weather ain't any too good, maybe... Good enough for that coot show up the street. He's packing them in. - Billy! - Hello, Finnegan! Isn't it too bad about Steve? - Steve? - The bartender in there. The doctor was in and discovered he had chronic prognosis. And him handling all them glasses the people drink out of out. I had a drink in there last night. You don't suppose I caught anything? If hadn't hit you yet you're all right, but I wouldn't be tempting fake twice. Don't worry I won't. Billy, if you're after something as intoxicating as whiskey, why don't you take in that new cut show that just opened up. Them turkish colleen's will make you feel like a newbie again. I will! - So, you're the one huh? - What's a big idea... Wait a minute, Joey Malone. It's not his fault. You know who put him up to this, don't you? I got a pretty good idea. Come on, Finnegan, beat it. Oh, the nerve of that guy. You're not gonna let him get away with this, are you? Why don't you go down there... That's exactly what I'm gonna do. Louie, I think my old friend Eddie needs a lesson. Good. I know some guys in Brooklyn that swell teachers. Now folks, your thrill at the breathtaking extravaganza entitled a night in a turkish harem. The show starts immediately folks so step right up and get your tickets and pass inside. Gentlemen, you haven't missed a thing yet the show starts in just a few minutes. Hurry, hurry, hurry, folks.

Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! You're All right? Frankie? I'm fine. Just resting. What happened? Seems like Joe wants to play a little rough. Wow, looks like an earthquake hit the joint. Yeah! When Irish eyes are smiling Sure, 'tis like the morn in Spring In the lilt of Irish laughter - You can hear the angels sing - Angels sing When Irish hearts are happy All the world seems bright and gay When Irish eyes are smiling Sure, they steal your heart... away - Charlie's a wonderful guy. - Off course, she is greatest bricklayer. And nobody can't tie! Hey, hello! See you later! Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. Gangway, gangway. When Irish hearts are happy All the world seems bright and gay Good evening, lads. Good evening gentlemen. What was that you said about bricklayers? Oh, there are a bunch of lilies, are they? Wait a minute what are you guys trying to pull? Yeah, what is it? Sure. and you'd better be taking back what you said about the irish too. We haven't said anything about anybody. Never you mind me here's what you said. What's the matter, lads? These two guys are making cracks about irish bricklayers. Telling me that one artisan can leak irishman. You wouldn't want to be proven that would you? - Now get away from me you! - Old chap! - Hey, Charlie, come on, let's go! - Oh no, you don't! ...they steal your heart away Look at the way that fell through that chair. Wasn't that beautiful? Magnificent! Let them alone. They only having fun. Come on sows, get out my way! If you wanna fight with irish, why you don't start with me? Come on, let's come him out of here. If we can see put Finnegan out town without nobody see him. I'll have Joe just where I want him. Let's suppose Finnegan don't wanna go? Well, it's up to us to make it. He's got to leave Coney tonight. Well, he can't go like this we got to bring him to first. Is he breathing? Either he's breathing or he just had an alcohol rub. Get his head up. I thought that'd bring him around. There you are, easy now. Don't, don't let him swallow the glass it's the only one we got. Feel better? The upper half of Finnegan is fully recovered. However the lower extremities are still in a coma. Perhaps another drink... You had us worry. Ah Frankie, me boy, you can't kill the irish. They just have to wear out like a pair of pants. Thank you. Ah, there! I feel like myself... You're hurt a lot worse than you think you are. Yeah! The only way for you to get better is to take it easy for a month or so. Sure! Go away someplace by yourself and relax. Some place like uh... Atlantic City! Now I know you haven't got any money... I don't have to go anywhere! I tell you guys there's nothing wrong with me. - But the doctor thinks different. - The doctor? Yeah! While you were unconscious we had the doctor up here to examine you. Two doctors, they had a consultation. Yeah! They said you've uh you've got cranium contusions. Contu... contusions? What's that? You cranium don't contuse. You see this thing here. Why, did the doctor call it the celibarium. The celibarium is supposed to come around here join these things up here. Then it meets the macrividities then it crosses up here to this thing here. Do you understand? Well, yours doesn't. - And rest is the only cure. - Cure? Ah, if an Irishman had to rest every time he was hit on the head, none of them would be finding time to go to work. I tell you, boys. I feel perfectly all... - You feel things sway in a bit. - No. - Do you, Eddie? - No. I'm beginning to feel a bit dizzy. That's what the doctor said. That's the first sign. Tell me, Finnegan, does it hurt you here? Right here? Well answer me, does it hurt you here? Yes! Now that you mentioned, that it does! Oh, let me feel your pulse. There you are. That's what the doctors were afraid of. He's lost all control of his hands. Isn't that a shame, can you go. Imagine... How's your throat? Kind of pods? Look at that skin! It's all pudgy. There's no life to it. Look at those eyes. Bloodshot! Can you breathe, all right? Kind of tighter. I can't breathe! Can you feel this? Can you feel the slap? - Can you feel it? - No. He's numb. Ah it's too bad, Finnegan! Too bad. Yes, it's a shame, it's a shame. But uh the doctor said you had nothing to worry about until you start getting cold flashes. Where? Right here, at back of your neck. Frankie! I got him! I'm freezing. Come on, Finnegan. We haven't got any time to waste. We got to get you on a train. Get me my hat! Get me an overcoat! Glory be ours! I was never so cold in my life. Don't worry a month in Atlantic City will make a new man out you. It's getting cold. I'm colder. Watch it, now. Take it easy. I got eight kings... Hold it, we're getting closer. To Finnegan. May he rest in peace. - Is it Joe looking? - Yeah! He can't figure it out. They're the ones that started. They got their mix to jump on me. Let me take one poke at them, will you? They've just been sitting there drinking, huh? Ever since Finnegan's funeral this morning. Finnegan! Oh so that's what it was. Yeah he croaked last night. I told him that brown stuff would get him sooner or later. Here he comes. He was the best friend a man ever had. Yeah! Finer irishman never lived. Why, I remember once the... - Hello, Joe. - I... Uh, just heard about Finnegan. That's tough. Uh, what was it, his heart? No Joe, his head. Yeah! Somebody hit him an awful wallop. What are you talking about? I only pushed him. I know, Joe, but you see, a brass rail don't know how to pull its punches. You guys wouldn't be trying a little high-class blackmail, would you? Joe, how can you say a thing like that? After I went and lied for you. Told the coroner he hit his head on a curb. Oh, but if it ever comes out it happened in here, we'd have to tell the truth, Eddie. Yes, suppose so. You can't tell a lie in court. That's perjury. No, you're right. We'd have to say we saw Joe hit him. You know, it's very funny, but there are a dozen people around here who swear I was in my office all the time. Why sure you've got nothing to worry about. Just like that time the guy was knifed in Gush Schneider's place. Gus beat the rap. That's right. The only thing they could do to him was close his place down as a public nuisance. Oh, they always do that when there's trouble in a joint. That's better than manslaughter. Yeah, but still be ashamed to see a nice place like this all boarded up. Okay, Eddie. How much do you want? Joe I'm surprised at you. I don't want anything. All I want is a chance to make a little more money for you. Why don't you let me run this place for you? I'll put on the shows and give it some class. Yeah! Give it some class. Have all the swells coming, here rich people. After all what are rich people? Poor people with money. You'd have me rattling a tin cup in a week. You'd steal me blind. No, you can handle a cash register. And I don't want any salary. All I'll take is of 50 percent of new business I bring in. No. It'll cost me less to bribe my way out. Well. Have it your own way, Joe. Hello Murph. Hello boys. Ah, It's a shame about Finnegan. I hear he stumbled and cracked his head. Well, he didn't exactly stumble, Murph. He was uh pushed. - You see... - Oh, Eddie! Eddie, uh, you can start work tomorrow morning. Oh, thanks, Joe. Pushed you say he was? Yeah! The devil pushed him, Murph. You see, he's been shoving him around for years. And finally he shoved too hard. That's the way Finnegan wanted to go. Quick. Without anyone even having a chance to say goodbye to him. That's just the way he went. 'Cause I love from head to toesie, lovey mine Cuddle up a little closer, lovey mine Cuddle up and be my little clinging vine Like to feel your cheek so rosy Like to make you comfy, cozy 'Cause I love from head to toesie, lovey, lovey, lovey lovey mine Okay, Kate. Nice rehearsal, folks. Come on down here for a minute earlier. I want you to meet somebody. Hey, Eddie, come here. This is Eddie Johnson. From now on he's going to be putting the shows on here. And whatever he says goes. I'd like to rehearse the whole bill once more, But I'm going to start with Miss Farley's last number. So the rest of you can go, but be back in a half hour. And you beat that. Joe! What's the idea? What do you mean he's putting on the shows. I'll explain to you later. Do me a favor and do what he says will you? Come on now, be a good girl. Now let's run through the song again, Miss Farley. What was wrong with it the last time? Well, you moved around too much. It's too fast and too loud. And you didn't make the words mean anything. Outside of that it was great, huh? Well, I think it'll help you take it in this "tempo". Wait a minute, I can't move around with music that slow. That's fine, then stand still. Well, what about Maggie Klein and Bonnie Thornton? That's the way they sing? Sure, that's the way everybody sings. But I'm trying to make you a little different. Well, I dance in this number two and I certainly can't dance to that "tempo". Well, when you dance we'll change the "tempo", but when you sing stand still and sing. Now will start with a chorus, take it from there. Cuddle up a little closer, lovey mine Cuddle up and be my little, clinging vine Look if you want your family in Brooklyn to hear you, use the telephone. What do you expect me to do? Whisper? There's going to be a crowd out there and they make a lot of noise. If you're good they'll listen. But if you're not, you can yell your lungs out and they still won't hear you. A crowd isn't just a flock of faces. It's a lot of separate people. And you've got to make each one of them feel that you're singing to him and him alone. And unless you can do that you might just as well take up juggling. Look you two-bit Tony Pastor. They like my style of singing around here. Nobody's going to change it understand nobody! I'll change it. Frankie. I might have to get a little rough. But maybe she's right. When she sing like that it's not a bad idea to keep moving. Frankie. What's he doing? Did you tell him to go back to that fast "tempo"? Not me. but I got a good idea who did. So you're going to sing it your way huh? That's right Mr. Belasco, you catch on quick. If you go down and tell that leader to play it the way I told you. - And time to keep vaping. - right. No, no, no! It's too fast. Play it the way Eddie told you. That's it. I'll jus keep vaping. What's going on? What's the matter with the curtain? I told him to hold it for a minute. I just want to fix the bottom of your dress. Now, what's wrong with this? What? What are you doing? Stop it! There, let's see what you can run the mile in now. Don't you dare put those on! Take out this or I'll break your neck! But stand stiil or so help you to break your neck. Put me down! - What you're trying to do? - Make a sing around you. I won't. I won't sing either! I'll show you! I won't sing a note! All right, then just keep quiet and people will take you for an overstuffed barrel. - What are you doing? - Well, we're at every might as well. Stop it you're ruining it. I paid a lot of money for this dress. Yes. I should have dipped your boiling water first. Ooh, you big baboon. Here, cover that piece. Oh, you just wait. You'll be sorry. Cheer up, lady. Okay, Sam, take it away. Why, I won't sing! Cuddle up a little closer, lovey mine Cuddle up and be my little clinging vine Like to feel your cheek so rosy Like to make you comfy, cozy 'Cause I love from head to toesie, lovey mine If you leave me, I will be lonely Because our love has just begun Don't forget I want you only Yes, you're the only one Cuddle up a little closer, lovey mine Cuddle up and be my little clinging vine Like to feel your cheek so rosy Like to make you comfy, cozy 'Cause I love from head to toesie, lovey mine Get me out of these things! What are you doing? Put me down put me down. Hurry up and get these handcuffs off me, they hurt. Yeah! I'll take them off. I just want to talk to you for a minute first. Well, I can hear just as well without these things. You can throw vases too. Well, what do you think of my way of singing now? That applause wasn't so much. Why, you couldn't have gotten any more if you'd been a parade. You know why they like you, Kate? Because tonight you had class. You weren't cheap and gaudy. Where do you get off talking to me like that? There are a lot of people around here who like me just the way I am, see? Sure, you're the sweetheart of every clam digger who drinks beer out of a tin can. But what about the boys who drink out of glasses? You're not their type, Kate. But you could be you've got warmth, appeal. You're attractive. Yeah, very attractive. In fact at the moment you're so attractive I feel like kissing you. - I think I will. - Get away. Why, you could have all of New York singing under your window, Kate. You're talented, you're beautiful. You just try talking instead of yelling and dressing instead of overdressing. Listen to him, if it isn't Mr. Astor. Look, you don't have to live on Fifth Avenue to know you don't spell class with a captain, Kate. I'm no dummy, Kate. I went to school finish the tenth grade. Why a... Oh-oh! Here comes that feeling again. Is that what you learned in the 10 th grade? No, that's why I was kicked out of the eleven. This rate I don't think I'll ever graduate. Just wait till I get these things off. I'll slap your face so hard it. No, you won't, Kate. Because you know I'm right. You know that tonight for the first time the audience treated you like a lady. And you loved it. Well, here's my face. I'm waiting. Get out of here. Good night, Kate. Good night. Thanks.

No, I'll go in for half. Take my divi and match it and we'll put it in the bank. Then every week we each chunk in the same amount before you know it we'll have enough. No, no. Come on, Joe. Give me the knot and you can start the ball rolling right now by taking my share. Hey, wait a minute! How about my share of your share. When we build a new place your share will be bigger. Yeah! So my hotel bill. - Go on, Frankie get the show started. - Okay, Joe. Well, so long, Abe. Hope I see you later. Oh, I'm sorry. This hand keeps getting me in trouble. Michael! Gentleman. Oh, Louie.

KATE FARLEY BIG HIT AT OCEAN GARDENS. KATE FARLEY DRAWS CARRIAGE TRADE TO CONEY. I love you, that from there and make of what you will It could be a lifetime of the sunshine Or only a springtime trail I love you, take from there and maybe you find you care You lifted my heart to heaven, baby Please don't take from there Dont take my heart from there I love you. Take from that. and make of what you will It could be a lifetime of sunshine Or only a springtime trail But sweet, I love you, take from that and maybe you find that you care You lifted my heart out to heaven, baby Oh, please don't take from there Please don't take my heart from there - Oh, honey, you're never better! - Oh, thanks, Eddie. You had that thing I've been talking about for months the trick of making every guy feel you're singing just to him. It's tough to learn, but you've got it now. It's not so tough when it's not a trick, Eddie. You mean all those pear-shaped tones were just for me? I'll be back in a minute I want to check on things out, right. you... seem to be getting along with the help very nicely. Oh, don't blame me. I was just standing there minding my own business when up she comes and practically proposes to me. Yes. I noticed how she had to chase you all around the stage to catch up to you. Well, when she gives me a look like that. Well I think it'd be very impolite to walk away, don't you? And a little crazy. Look Eddie, I don't mind you trimming me out of money. I can laugh about that. But when it comes to Kate, I lose my sense of humor. Oh, I wouldn't do that, Joe. I got a feeling you're going to need it. I'm warning you, Eddie. I'm going to do everything I can to break it up. I'm trembling like a leaf, Joe. Look, you've got a good job, you make good money. I'd hate to see you wind up with those walnut shows again. Uh, you don't have to give me the boot. I was figuring on pulling out pretty soon anyway. Remember that night we talked about building that new place? And I told you I was gonna have it with you or without you? Well, I decided then it was going to be without you. I've just been biding my time. I don't look very worried, do I? No, Eddie. That'll take a lot more money than you've got. That's why I went to the Brooklyn Savings bank. They said if Ihad an attraction like Kate, maybe they'd lend me the money. What makes you think she'll go with you? Love is a wonderful thing. Hey, you look a little worried now, Joe. - Come on, Charlie. Clean off that table. - Yes, sir, right away. - But look alive. - Pardon me. Is Mr. Rocco in. I'm William Hammerstein. No, he hasn't come in yet. Have you got a "res"? Willie Hammerstein? Victoria Theater? Glad to see you, Mr. Hammerstein. No Mr. Rocco isn't here. But Mr. Johnson is. Would you mind stepping this way. He's just having his supper. Sr. Johnson. This is Sr. Hammerstein. You know? Victoria Theater. - Oh, you do you do, Mr. Hammerstein. - How do you do? I received a letter from Mr. Rocco a few days ago asking me to drop by and hear some singer, Kate Farley. He thought I might be able to use her in my new show. Oh, he did, huh? Well, I hadn't expected him back until 10 o'clock, but if he made an appointment with you... No, no, there was nothing definite. I didn't know when I could make it. It I just happened to be visiting friends at Brighton beach, so I thought I'd come over. Oh, well I'll be glad to take care of you. Jerry, show Mr. Hammerstein to a front table. Yes, sir. It's a great honor to have you with us, Mr. Haverstein. - Thank you. - Right way, sir. Front table, Jerry. - So, that's what Joe's up to? - Yeah! But why? He's afraid I'll open up a place of my own and take Kate with me. - Go get Finnegan. - Yeah. I don't know. I feel awful he'll be running out like this. Forget it. There's nobody important out front, anyway. We'll be back in time for the second show. How about grabbing a little that cool breeze on the pier, honey? - Oh, I'd love to... - Please stop worrying. Dolly knows all your numbers. Well I'm not worrying about Dolly. But you're not there and Joe's not there. Do you think Frankie can handle everything? Well, I sure hope so. Mr. Hammerstein I would like you to meet Kate Farley's father. - Sr. Hammerstein, this is a great pleasure. - How do you do. - Sit down, Mr. Farley, sit down. - Thank you, thank you, Mr. Harris. You know, Mr. Hammerstein. It's very nice of you to come all the way out here to hear Kate sing. I promise you you'll not be disappointed. I'm sure I won't. Mr. Rocco tells me she sings beautifully. She certainly does, like a bird. Here she comes now the little darling. Cuddle up a little closer, lovey mine - Is that? - Yes. That's her wonderful? Like to make you comfy, cozy 'Cause I love from head to toesie, lovey mine - What I tell you ain't she exquisite? - Well, she... I know, just what you're gonna say Mr. H. She's too good for this joint. Say, that dentist did a good job for her on them teeth don't you think? Yeah! And she sure needed. Them that other set was always clicking. And I'm gonna have big crystal chandeliers like Harry Hill's the bowery. You're really gonna have yourself a place, aren't you? Coney's never seen anything like it. - You know who's going to sing for me? - Who? - You. - Oh, really? Sure. I'm going to have nothing but the best you. You know the spot I got picked out for? The place right next to Sally's. Say, that's a good location. Yeah! I imagine the business you could do with a first class cafe on that corner. Imagine the money it costs to build too. I don't worry, I'll get the money. I've got a couple angles I've been working on. You know if you're not careful you're gonna wind up owning Coney Island. I intend to. Coney Island, Coney Island by the sea And the poor block will see - Like a hula-ah. - Is a coconut tree Beautiful Coney Island Raised island down the bay But when you smile. Is a tropical island. A little paradise far away - But when you smile. - Is a tropical island. A little paradise far away Oh you're not thinking of going, Mr. Hammerstein. While she does three great numbers in the second show. I, uh, promised to catch another act in town. So, I'm afraid I'll have to... Well, if you have to, you have to. However I'll tell Mr. Rocco you were here and that you were greatly impressed. Yes, do that. Tell him I couldn't wait. - Goodbye, Mr. Hammerstein! - Goodbye, Mr. Hammerstein! Good evening, boys. - Mr. Hammerstein? - Yes. I'm Joe Rocco. I wish I'd known you were coming tonight. That was all right. Mr. Johnson took care of me. - I caught the show. - What do you think of Miss Farley? Well as you told me she's very unusual. You think he can use her? Well I'll think it over and let you know. Good night, Mr. Rocco. Goodnight, Mr. Hammerstein. There you are. I told you. I'd get you back in time. - Hello Miss Farley, hello Eddie. - Hello, fellas? - Hello. - Hello, Joe. Hello. - What's the matter? - Nothing. But uh how did you get dressed so fast? Oh! I didn't play the first show. Dolly took my songs. The boss here gave me a little vacation. That's too bad. You know who was out front? Willie Hammerstein. Oh, no! Looking for a singer for his new show. So I invited him over to hear you. Isn't that just my luck? The one night I take off and Willy Hammerstein's in the audience. Why didn't you let me in on it? Well, I didn't know he was gonna catch it tonight and I wasn't here when he came in. But, uh, Eddie was. Well, huh... How should I know which one was Hammerstein. I've never seen him before in my life. That's funny. He told me that Mr. Johnson had taken care of him very nicely. It's a funny thing when he heard Dolly sing he thought it was you. I wonder where he got that idea. Somebody didn't bother to change the signs. It looks like Mr. Johnson took care of a lot of things. Now, wait a minute, honey... - Why didn't you tell me? - Well, I... That's simple, if you went with Hammerstein Eddie couldn't get you for his new place. And without you there wouldn't be any new place. Why, that's not true. I could... Thanks a lot for being so nice to me tonight, Eddie. I'll never forget it. Uh, before you quit I just want you to know that you're fired. You know something, Eddie? Now you look a little worried. Gee, I'm scared. Just take it easy, honey. You've got nothing to worry about. But if he likes me what'll I say? How much money should I ask for? You just sing, let me take care of the business. Well, I must say, you're a great improvement over the Kate Farley I saw last night. Oh, I'm awfully sorry about what happened, Mr. Hammerstein. Oh, don't be. It wasn't your fault. Now my dear if, uh, you're ready I am. I certainly, pardon me. We can sit right here, Mr. Rocco. - How do you dow - Let's have the music. It's a new number. Do you know it? I'll get through it. How's this? Pardon me, but that's a little too fast. It's just two-four time. That's the way I'm playing. Yes I know but, I sing it a little slower. I see, all right sister. I'm sorry, I'm late. I'm Miss Farley's piano player. I'll take over now. Why didn't they tell me you were coming? I could have slipped this Thanks just the same. I love you. Take from that. and make of what you will It could be a lifetime of sunshine Or only a springtime trail I love you, take from there and maybe you find you care You lifted my heart up to heaven, baby Please don't take from there Well? Sure, all right. There's no use, Mr. Hammerstein. Your smile gave you away. That's too bad. I thought if I frowned I might get her for a hundred dollars less. No. All right then, she's great. Come on into the office and we'll talk it over. We'll enter a few minutes, Kate. All right! Thank you, very much. You played it exactly the way I... Hello, Kate. Now, wait a minute. If you'll only listen I can I can tell you. Why, I... Now, look you might just as well stop squirming because you're gonna listen to me if I have to put handcuffs on you again. It seems to me I listened to you once before and wound up on the pier. Of all the selfish can I... Oh, wait a minute. Remember me? I'm the guy who just played the piano for you. if I wanted to I could have grabbed your act awful easy. I didn't though because I was rooting for you to get the job. I'm sorry about last night, Kate, honest. Oh, you're sorry, huh? That's supposed to make everything all right. No, but it should make you take the cotton out of your ears long enough for me to tell you why I did it. I know why you did it. Because all you want is that new place and you don't care what you do to get it. That's what I tried to tell myself too. But that wasn't the real reason, Kate. I didn't want you to work here because you put too much distance between us. There's exactly eleven miles between here and Coney. And the elevator runs every half hour. I'm not talking about that kind of distance. Once you hit Broadway you're gonna have every guy who owns a top hat hanging around. This ninety eight cent skimmer would be a little out of place in your dressing room. That's a lot of nonsense and you know it. Well it's happened before. You'll be eating in Delmonico's. It's a lot more than miles from Coney to Delmonico's. There's no elevator that makes that trip I love you, Kate. I didn't want to lose you. That's why I did what I did last night. That's all I have to say. Thank you for listening. Eddie! There won't be any top heads in my dressing room. All I want is this 98 skimmer. Oh, you haven't seen her then, huh? Well, if she comes in tell her to call me right away, will you? Thanks. She nodded her sisters they ain't heard from her all day. Keep looking. Maybe she's with Dolly, go and see, will ya? Well, I'll try it. Oh, here she comes. She's with bright eyes again. - Joey. - Waiting for you. - Hello! - Hello, Joe. Where have you been? I've been looking for you. I'm sorry Joe, but Eddie came along and... I figured it was better if Kate wasn't around while you were talking business. Hammerstein wanted you to sign a contract. - He did? - You see what did I tell you. And you were worrying. Oh, that's wonderful! He wanted you to meet the songwriters too. Where'd you go? Every place, Delmonico's, the casino, Wanna Makers... The City Hall. Well you shouldn't have run off without telling... - City Hall? - That's right, Joe. Look. Just like a liquor license. Only it's got cupid's on it. Well, you might say congratulations. Sure. - Congratulations. - Thanks, Joe. Hammerstein will be in his office in the morning. I made an appointment for you at 11. Oh, but I can't make it tomorrow. We're being married this afternoon and leaving on our honeymoon right after. Yeah, that's why we stopped by. I always promised you I'd let you be best man, Joe. How about it? How long have you been gone? Oh, a couple of weeks. I figured Hammerstein wouldn't start rehearsals until august. Okay I'll tell him you'll sign up when you get back. Thanks. Well, will we see you at the church? Yeah! Which one? The little one across from Brighton Park at 4:30. - Okay. I'll be there. - We'll see you later then. - Bye. - Goodbye. Oh, I am glad to see you. So nice of you to come. Mr. Finnegan... - Right this way. - Thank you. Watch your step, please. Well, good afternoon. I have three in the fourth row center, would that be all right? - As long as we can see? - Why, certainly. Right this way, please. Uh, would you like Wagner coming in and Mendelsohn going out? Yeah, yeah! Let them both sing. Glad to see you. I've got a nice seat, right on the aisle. Right this way, please. No, no, I'm looking for Mr. Johnson. He hasn't arrived yet, has he? No, but he'll be here if not a lot of us are wasting our time. Yes, is Miss Farley around? Yes he's right in that room there. - In there, sir. - Thank you. Come in! And tell him to have the carriage all ready because we'll only have ten minutes to catch the train. I'll have him bring it to the side door you can get away easier. - Good. - Oh, pardon. Yes? I'm sorry to bother you, Miss Farley... Oh, honey, you look simply elegant. Now don't be nervous. I've been married four times and I tell you there's nothing to it. Srta. Farley, I'm Horace Carter, from the Brooklyn Savings bank. Oh now don't tell me my account is overdrawn again. Oh no, no, I just wanted to talk to Mr. Johnson. But I understand he's not here yet. Oh, he'll be here in a minute. Well I've got to get back to the bank. And you're busy and I thought perhaps you could just give him the message. Why certainly. I'm sorry to bother you with business at a time like this. - Oh, lovely. - Yes, aren't they? But we heard you were leaving town right away and we just wanted you both to know the good news before you left. - Good news from a bank? - Yeah, just for once. Just tell Mr. Johnson that we've talked it over and we've decided to go along with him to the loan of 50.000 on his new cafe. Oh, that's wonderful. He'll be delighted to hear it. I'm sorry we took so long to make up our minds, But an investment like this without any security is pretty risky. Sometimes cafes catch on and sometimes they don't. Well if anybody can make one go Mr. Johnson can. It's probably true, but uh frankly we consider your reputation a little better security than his. Well, thank you. I'm sure an attraction like you would make any cafe succeed. Oh, but I won't be singing in his cafe. I'm going to work for Willy Hammerstein. - You are? - Oh, yes. That's strange... Well, Mr. Johnson called us just a little while ago and said that now that you and he were going to be married you changed your mind. He told you that? Huh yes he led us to believe that it was all settled. No, he hasn't even mentioned it to me. Well that puts a different complexion on the entire matter. Why, the whole deal was based on the fact that he could get you. Well I I'm certainly glad we had this little talk, Miss Farley. Yes, So my. I'm sorry if I've said anything that. No, no. It's all right. - Goodbye, Mrs. Farley. - Goodbye. Where you been? You're late! Yes, I know. Louie had a shortcut. We came by the all of Albany. Yeah! I got stuck in traffic. Hurry up you're on in two minutes. You always hold the curtain for the leading man, sweetheart. Where's Kate? She's in there. Oh, you mustn't go in there, it's bad luck. Quiet, today is my lucky day. Here see the Joe this one rose. Hiya, Mr. Johnson. Brought you a couple of posies for the train. Thanks Eddie, they're beautiful. They've got nothing on you. - Did you get the tickets? - Yep. Two days in Niagara Falls then down through Canada into Detroit back to Buffalo on the boat and then home. What are you gonna do when you get back, Eddie? I don't know. I haven't decided yet. Hey. I look pretty good, don't ain't? What about that cafe you were talking about? Maybe, if those monkeys at the bank ever make up their minds. Have you talked to them lately? Nope. Just the once. Last week. I figure from now on they can come to me. They did. A man was just here. He was? What do you have to say? Quite a bit. Hey, what's the matter? Eddie. Did you tell him I was going to sing for you? No. Last week I said I might be able. To talk to them again today just a little while ago. Today? Why I haven't talked to anybody... You told them they had nothing to worry about. That you'd have me all tied up in no time. Now, wait a minute I don't know who was here or what he said but... Don't try to lie, Eddie. He told me everything. That you couldn't get the money without me. What were you gonna do? Try to convince me on our honeymoon. Is that why you're marrying me? Kate. You don't honestly believe that, do you? After last night now this what do you expect me to believe. I'll tell you what I expect you to believe. That I marry you because I love you and for no other reason. That's a lot to ask, isn't it? Kate, I'm telling the truth. I can prove it. But you better get started awful fast. No. I'm not even gonna try. Because this is more than just a misunderstanding, Kate. This is our whole future together in a nutshell. You bet it is. And I'm gonna be awful sure of the road before I go any further. But you got to believe me. Not because of any proof I can give you, but because down deep you just know I'm on the level. Unless you can do that kate our marriage won't be worth a hoot. Is that all you're going to tell me? That's all. Someday you're going to find out I'm telling the truth, Kate. And it's going to be too late. If you leave now, it's over. You know that, don't you? WILLIAM HAMMERSTEIN PRESENTS "LOVELY LADIES" WITH KATE FARLEY Intermission, ten minutes. - They found her in Coney Island. - Oh, really? Well, looks like she's in. Oh she's a sin. She's got him standing on her ears. Would you rather go in the Green Room and have some champagne? No thanks. Why don't you get so tired of drinking nothing but champagne. Hmm, where do you throw your old diamonds? How are you? Glad to see you. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Don't hurry. Hello, Joe. Hello, Eddie. Where have you been keeping yourself? I haven't seen you around. I've sort of been looking for you. Well, I've been living in town. What with handling Kate's business and rehearsals and everything. I've been pretty busy. Kate doesn't know how lucky she is having somebody like you looking after her. Yes, yes. Well when... things settle down a little let's get together sometime. Don't worry, Joe. We will. Are you, uh, going back to say hello? I might. I think I will. Well, I've got to check with the box office. It's good to see you, Eddie. Yeah. - Who is it? - It's me, honey. Come in Oh, Kate, they love you out there. You should hear what they're saying. Sensational! Better than Anna Heim. Really? You're even keeping the critics awake. Oh, that's wonderful! Is it because I'm singing good or loud. Wait did you see the papers in the morning. Oh I'm keeping my fingers crossed. - Oh, come on, Libby! - Yes. Say, uh, you know who I just saw in the lobby? - Eddie. - Oh. Did you hear me? I said I just saw Eddie. I heard you. He said he might drop back to say hello. Oh, he did? Well tell him he can save himself for trouble. I won't see him. Do you really mean that? Hang around and you'll find out for yourself. What about my cape, did they fix it? Yes, I'm at all to be ready by now. I'll go get it. Oh and be sure and tell them to loosen that tie so I can get out of it easily. Yes, and I will. Oh, I'll certainly be glad when this performance is over. I'm going straight home... But what about Willie? He wants to join this party at Rectus. No, Joe. I'm so tired I'd much rather just... What's this? Oh, just a little something I picked up today. Oh, Joe! And I didn't win it in the crap game either I bought it in a store. Oh, it's beautiful! Hey, wait a minute! That's a left-handed ring. No go, huh? No, no. You keep it. Just because a horse runs second he doesn't ask for his entry feedback. Joe I'm so sorry. Oh, why honey there's no figuring these things. You look at a guy and you either get heartburn or you don't. So it's all right. Forget about it. Kate... Since I did run out of the money that there's something that you ought to know. That day when you were gonna be married... Come in! Hello, Kate! Joe! Hello, Eddie. I just want to drop back and tell you how much I'm enjoying the show you're swell kate even better than I thought you'd be. Thanks, glad you like it. - Have you been, Eddie? - Couldn't be better. I'm opening my new place next month. When it gets running I want you two to drop out. Oh, we will. We certainly will. - Where's your new place going to be? - Spot I always had in mind. I thought you took an option on that building. I did but I let it go. Don't tell me you took it over. Eddie, I hate to be the one to tell you, But the only reason I let that place go is because the fire commissioner tipped me off to something. They're gonna condemn that building next month. Joe I hate to be the one to tell you, but the guy who told you that wasn't the fire commissioner. So you send them up. The way you two double-cross each other and smile about it beats me. We've been double-crossing each other ever since we were kids. - Haven't we, Joe? - Yeah we should pull some beauties. I remember the night on that train going to Memphis. When I was asleep you threw all my clothes out the window. I had to ride all the way to Galveston in my union suit. I remember! And how about the time you got me the date with that blonde she turned out to be the sheriff's wife. But the best one, Kate, was when I was running a freak show in Toledo. Joe painted the mayor's face on the sword swallowers body and I got 30 days. Remember the night in South Bend? He paid me off in counterfeit bills and I got drunk and tried to cash one of them in the police station. And what about the day of the church where you said that guy over who was supposed to be from the bank. That was a pep. I'll never forget that. I must have talked to a dozen actors before I found the right guy. He sure put it over, didn't he? You should have seen his makeup, it was perfect. I'll bet it was. I gotta give you credit, Joe. Joe that was the best one you ever thought. I thought I'd die laughing when Louie told me how he died jumping traffic... Good night, Miss Farley.
