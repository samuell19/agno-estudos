THIS STORY IS FICTIONAL AND DOESN'T DEPICT INDONESIA'S WAR OF INDEPENDENCE OF 1945. INCLUDING THE NAMES, CHARACTERS, AND PLACES. SHOULD THERE BE ANY SIMILARITIES, THAT WOULD BE MERE COINCIDENCE. Get out! They're lucky to be Japanese soldiers. They got food and cigarettes. Work? None. What's so lucky about it? We are luckier. No one to tell us what to do. If you want food for free, just get locked up in jail once in a while. Fortune is coming, why do you want to avoid it? What about our lives? Salute, sir. - Thank you. - Thank you. Naga is coming! You're getting poorer. - Hi, Thamrin. Do you still sell milk? - I'm already out of business. - Naga. - Are you still in school? As usual, you know. HBS alumni. - Where's Pohan? - He's inside. Come on in. Where have you been? Pohan. As usual. We just got some rest. The war will start soon. War? Indonesian independence has been proclaimed in Jakarta. You don't know that? What could we know in jail? - Listen to this. - Is it done already? "Indonesian youth Let's all rise up Our nation is independent now The drums of war have started to play Listen, the motherland is calling you" If the Dutch come back, we fight them. Drink this, Naga. Drink it. It's free for today. - This is mine. - Thank you. Buy some cigarettes first. It has been two weeks since I last smoked. - That's right. - That's right. - Murad. - What? How much do you want to buy this? Who did you steal that from? Our people are poor, but you still steal from them? It belonged to a Japanese soldier. It belonged to a Japanese soldier? You're good. Who said I'm not good? Bujang. Malaria. I told you. What did you tell me? You must be treated. - Where's your house? - In Medan. I know it's in Medan. I saw you in Kesawan many times. Did you work there? If you don't have a house, just stay here for a while. It's not necessary. Kirana. Yes, Dad. Tell Bidah to tidy up the room in the back. What for, Dad? We have a patient here. Okay, Dad. Wait a minute here. My daughter will take care of you. Zulmi. How much do we owe you? Don't worry about the cost. Because you've got money, right? How have politics been? Do you long for freedom? Do you still have to ask about that? This is Radio Republik Indonesia with the news program. The first British army has arrived in Tanjung Priok. Apparently, their coming is followed by the Dutch army. This is actually has been predicted. Indonesian government will file a complaint. The Dutch army is following the Allied army everywhere. And then they start to provoke people. People begin to fight. Anybody who is healthy and strong, with any kind of weapon, go to the front line with one ambition, freedom or death. Meanwhile in the rearguard, people are starting a sweep to catch the enemy's spies and traitors. Doctor Zulmi, a famous doctor, was considered a traitor. People's army, led by Mariam, surrounded his house, but the doctor has already escaped. Look. Look at this. This is cheese. It's proof that Zulmi is a spy for the Dutch. That's right. Mariam, this is his picture. - Where's his daughter? - She's not here. - His horse? - It's not here either. Here. People's army, led by Naga Bonar, defeated the enemy's army and broke down their ammunition storage. Tie those Japanese! - Break down the storage! - Break it down! Tank Division, go! - Tank Division! - Tank Division! Yes! Spread out. - Gosh. There's that crazy guy again. - Who is that? It's Naga Bonar. Mortar in position. Fire away. I don't see Naga Bonar. At least that one is done for. - Naga! Where are you? - I'm here! - Where's that voice coming from? - That's not his voice. It's a ghost. What do you mean by ghost? I'm going to get you, Bujang! You fools! What? He's still alive? Spread out. Right flank, attack! Bren! That hurts! What an idiot. Indonesian youth Let us all rise up Our country is independent now Lukman! - Lukman! - Yes. What's next? I forgot. What do you mean? The next line of Pohan's poem that I recited earlier! This mortar keeps hitting us and you're asking about a poem? Tell them to stop shooting! That's the Dutch's mortar! They wouldn't want to stop! I told you to tell them to stop! Murad, you tell them. Stop! You fools! See? I told you. Now you answer me. - The drums of war have started to play... - Okay, I get it. Listen, the motherland is calling you! Shoot them! Retreat, everyone. Back to the barracks. Gosh. Why aren't the Dutch moving? A courier from the headquarters is coming! What is it? We have a command from headquarters. The shooting must stop. We will negotiate with the Dutch. We've negotiated, but the NICA still came here. Naga Bonar must come to the headquarters to receive the retreat command. Retreat? Come here. Where should we retreat? To the ocean? What if I fall into the ocean? And I could be eaten by fish. Have you been eaten by fish? No, I haven't. But you must retreat. I don't want to retreat! Go forward! Go forward! This is Major Pohan's command! - Retreat! - Retreat! - Go forward or retreat? - I heard go forward. I heard retreat. - Go forward! - Retreat! Why didn't you tell me earlier it's Major Pohan's command? If he says retreat, then we'll retreat. Barjo! Retreat. Retreat! - Mom, come on. - What? We have to move from here. Being chased by the police again, are you? You're embarrassing me! That hat with the ornate fur, who did you steal it from? This is the commander's hat. Amazing. Now you're the commander of the thief. Go! Go away! - Mom. - What? Please talk to my mom. She doesn't listen to me anymore. This is what happens if your name is already ruined. What should I say to her? Whatever you want, as long as you can make her move with us. - Wish me luck then. - Hurry. - Freedom or death! - Freedom or death! Go away! Go! You're the one who taught my son to steal, weren't you? I failed. The troops are ready to go. Have you prepared the lodging and headquarters? Yes. Barjo and his squad are already there. - Get your men to rest. Over there. - Yes, sir. Murad, move the squad over there. - Let's move. - Move. - Jang, let's just carry my mom. - I can't do that. - She said I was the one who taught you... - Don't mind her. We are artists. Just like Pohan. - At ease! - We can rest for a while. My goodness. Bujang. The more I see her, the prettier she gets. Of course. She's the daughter of a doctor. You go over there. You tell her... - Well, just tell her. - Tell her what? You know. No, I really don't know. What should I tell her? You tell her... that I like her. Then you must tell her yourself. I'm too scared to do that. What if she slaps me? You're really useless. You can't help me with anything. - Naga! You received a command. - A command? - Who dares to command me? - Your mom. - Naga! Come here! - Yes, Mom! - Come here you! - Yes, Mom. - Do you want something? You, come here. - Yes. Why don't you want to come with us? I don't want him to carry me. He smells like a buffalo. - Get them ready. - Parade! Attention! - What? - Right turn. Right turn. Bujang will carry you, okay? He doesn't smell any better. - Forward. March! - Forward. March! - You march forward too. - Yes, sir. - Go and ride my horse. - Yes. - Let me ride it. - What? Naga told me to ride it. Yes, right. Come on, Mom. - When will you marry? - I have no time for that yet. Too many excuses. When will you repent? - Tell that to Naga. - Yes. - Gather those over there! - Right. - Come on, quick! - Right. Your mom ran out of betel. Tell someone to get it or she will tell me to do it. - I did. - Good. - Bujang. - Yes? Mom told me to marry. - I promised her you would marry soon. - Promise? How dare you promise her that? Keep your voice down. People might hear you. This is my body. So why did you make that promise? She accused me of teaching you to become a thief. So I told her that you would marry soon. You know how your mom is. Once she starts talking, she could eat you alive. I'm really disappointed in you. We've been through everything together. In jail, in street vendors. And now you only think about yourself. What's so hard about it? - It'll only take a minute. - But what would... People might hear you. But what would the world say if Naga Bonar suddenly got married in the middle of a war? You've got a point there. - I haven't thought about the world. - That's your fault. - Bujang. - What is it? - What if I propose Kirana? - Her father is in NICA. We can try and get him back to his senses. I'll tell Lukman to talk and debate with her father. When Lukman starts talking about the world, her father wouldn't stand it. He would fly our red and white flag right away. That's good. But before you propose to her, take a shower first. Do some shopping. Buy the peacock brand scented soap. That's a good soap. That's the hard part. If I take a shower, my malaria will relapse. - Just tolerate it. - Naga. A courier came with a command from the governor. They commanded us to negotiate with the Dutch commander about the demarcation line. Read it. What's to negotiate? NICA still came here! - Get Lukman and Murad. - Yes. What will they do to us? I don't know, Bidah. I don't even know where my father is and I'm stranded here. People say they usually kill the captives. But that thief doesn't look very mean to me. How do you know that? He put in a lot of effort to carry his mom here. It means he has a good heart. If we're nice to him, maybe he will set us free. Why don't you try it then? I feel disgusted just being close to him. But if it's not because of him, we might have been killed by Mariam. To negotiate with the Dutch, each one of us must have a rank to get their respect. Right. And our rank can't be lower than theirs. What are their ranks, Lukman? I don't know. But to be safe, let's give Naga the highest rank. - What's that? - Marshal of Medan. Is there such a thing as Marshal of Medan in the army? Yes. All the great commanders of World War II were marshals. Marshal Rommel, Marshal Montgomery. What do you think? Do you agree with that Marshal of Medan rank? I don't quite agree with it. Can't you add something to it? Add something? - What about Marshal of Medan Lubuk Pakam? - We don't have that kind of rank. But we do have the Lubuk Pakam bus company. If it's only Marshal of Medan, then I don't want it. I told you that kind of rank doesn't even exist. If it doesn't, then you make it. - Make it? What would the world say? - Exactly. What I've been thinking about is the world that you just mentioned. You know Naga Bonar, the tobacco seller? All he does is deceive people. One kati of tobacco, he'd call it two kati. He's from Medan. If my rank is Marshal of Medan, people would think he is me! What would the world say? Then you do what you want. Don't get me involved. Do whatever you want. Don't be sulky. Sit down. - Is there any other rank? - The lower one. General. That's it. General Naga Bonar. You're great. Good for us to have you as a spokesperson for our headquarters. - Agree? - Agree. - Murad, you become a colonel. - Agree. - Barjo, you're a lieutenant colonel. - Agree. - And me, the rank of major is enough. - Agree. - But rice is my authority. - Agree. - The rank matter is solved. - Not yet. What about Bujang? His case is rather complicated. He's an errand boy. Carry your chair, take out your swords. - Let's make him a corporal. - Agree. The epaulets have been prepared. We'll have another meeting to discuss the negotiation. The meeting is over. You're amazing, Lukman. You're very fast. Of course. We're facing a blitzkrieg now. I'm disappointed in you. What did I do wrong? He appointed me as corporal and you didn't do anything. How can I debate Lukman? He went to HBS. I didn't even finish elementary school. - You should've tried. - I've tried once. He demoted me from marshal to general. If I tried again, I don't know what will happen to me. - Maybe I wouldn't even become a corporal. - Then I'm really disappointed. - So what do you want? - Try and think carefully. Murad was a coffee merchant. His coffee wasn't even that good. And he becomes a colonel. Barjo was a teacher who got fired because he never worked but still got paid became a lieutenant colonel. Lukman who talks a lot and runs like a coward when he hears a mortar becomes mayor. And I, who has always been in the front line to make sure you have your seat, he makes me a corporal. I went far away from my hometown and I only got a corporal rank? So what rank do you think they should give you? At least the deputy general. General. - The meeting will start soon. - Right. I feel like spitting him in the face. So you want me to argue with Lukman? Yes. You tell him, "Lukman, if not for me and Bujang, you wouldn't be able to talk like this." But if he demotes me to corporal, you would stand by me, right? I will stand by you until my last breath. I think the rank division is not finished yet. Goodness. What else now? About Bujang, we're not being fair to him. I want him to be promoted as deputy general. Since the era of Prophet Adam up until now, there's no such thing as a deputy general. But since you're the general, just appoint him your deputy then. - But leave me out of it. - Don't be like that. If you say there's no such thing as deputy general, so be it. But what if we promote him to sergeant? Never before in any military history in any part of the world, people got promoted in five minutes. You tell him his rank is corporal now. It's suitable for him. - I debated him. - And the result? I lost. See? I told you. - How could I possibly... - That's enough. Thank you. I went so far from my hometown just to become a corporal. That's what I can't take. So this is the end of our friendship. I'm leaving. You're leaving me? I have no choice. If you still want to leave, here. What for? Shoot me first, then you can go. Look. To General Naga Bonar, salute! Naga! - Where are you going? - I have something to take care of. Bring me some betel. The betel that Bujang brought me has gone bad. All right, Mom. The one I was staring at was Kirana, but the smile I got was from Bidah. She thinks we're in the same league. She's so shameless. A maid and general couldn't be the right match. But I never heard a general has to buy the betel. Shut up! Didn't you see a mocking smile on Kirana's face? If you want us to capture her, just give us the command. - I'll rip your mouth. - If you do that, I'll be dead then. What can I do? You're a general and I'm corporal. Good day, general. How are you? Yes. "Made in Swiss." You seem to know a lot about watches. Yes. - Shall we begin? - Yes, Major. Please have a seat, General. Take a seat, major. Lieutenant, ask His Excellency where his position is. To determine the demarcation line, we would like you to show me the position of your army. Yes. There are many birds here. Over here. - Did you see what he pointed out? - No, major. Well, General. Your hand is very fast. I'm an artist. What is he saying? What does he mean? He's claiming to be an artist. An artist? You must be a poet. You Indonesian folk are all poets. Are you a poet, General? Right. A dancer. - Yes. - Yes. Major, he says he's a dancer. My goodness, a dancer. Very well. It's one thing after another. - This major is having a headache? - Yes. Major is a little bit dizzy. We ask you to show us the position of your army once again. Pay close attention. STRAITS OF MALACCA - Here. - There? Yes. Parit Buntar? No. Yes. That's impossible. Isn't that where our field kitchen has been installed? Certainly, major. That's impossible, General. That's where the royal army is located. - And there's a kitchen there. - Yes, many kitchens. Yes. The royal army's kitchen is there. - Cook... - Yes, eat. - No. Cook... - Yes. Eat. - Come on. - Lieutenant? General, maybe you pointed to the wrong spot. We ask you to point it to us once again. Well, he's pointing at Parit Buntar again. Well, I think we should await further instructions. I'm sorry, General. We have to wait for further instruction. Yes. Well, general. Have a nice day. Yes. Made in Swiss. It's fantastic. We can't find this kind of watch here. Keep it safe with you. It was Major Sloot's watch. - The major you're negotiating with? - Sure. So even though you're a corporal, but you have a major's watch. - Major? - Yes. Be quiet, please! This is an important matter! We must negotiate again. This is important. Nothing is important. Do you realize what did you do earlier this afternoon? We can be accused of thwarting the negotiation. What would the world say? - It's all right. - You're confusing the major. What's wrong with that? Why does it bother you? This is negotiation, not a game. I'm not playing any games, Lukman. Those Dutch thought they were smart and we're stupid! But Naga Bonar is not stupid. If I showed them our position, they would ask where we keep our mortars and 12,7 machine guns. They asked that to negotiate and determine the demarcation line. You're stupid. If they know our position, tomorrow you will see their bombs showering us like rain above our heads. Then you all would be dead. Do you want it to happen? If you don't want to show them our position, fine then. But why did you point to Parit Buntar? We all know they've already occupied that area. Why do they occupy it then? That's the hometown of Murad's grandmother. - Isn't that right, Murad? - Right, Naga. It's not their hometown. So you tell that Major... Who's that? Watch. Tell that Major Watch not to stay in Murad's grandmother's hometown. - Tell them to go back to their homeland. - You're right. But you could have pointed to another village nearby to make them believe us. You could point Tanjung Beringin. Why did you choose Parit Buntar? How was I supposed to know, Lukman? I never learned how to read maps. I saw a hole in the map, so I decided on that spot. Apparently, it was their kitchen. So he got a headache. Come on, Lukman. I don't believe those Dutch. We keep negotiating with them, but they still come to colonize us. - Barjo. - Yes, General. Tell them to put the 12,7 guns in Simpang Empat intersection. Tell Lubis to put mortar in Sagala Hill and put Timbang and rifle squad in Sunpadang. When the Dutch come, tell Lubis to shoot the mortar into the canyon, wait with the rifle team and hit their asses with guns from the side. Yes, General. Bujang, smell it. A peacock brand soap? Yes. You told me to buy it. I lathered up three times. Now you really smell like a general. We can smell it all the way to Medan. What is that major doing in your girlfriend's place? What a shameless guy. What to do? What should I say? I didn't finish my elementary school and he's graduated from HBS. Just demote him to private. I feel kind of sick to see Lukman. What did I tell you? You didn't tell me anything. I wonder. All he does is think. I asked him, "What are you thinking, Lukman?" But he got mad. He said, "The Dutch are near and we need to think about it." Thinking and thinking. I guess he also thinks in his sleep. But the Dutch are still in Parit Buntar. Maybe he's gone crazy. - Have you told her I will come? - I've told her. Bujang, my malaria's coming. - Blanket! - Yes. It's all Lukman's fault. He never told me to take a bath. - Don't hold the cupboard. - Okay. The house could break down and I'd get killed. The seizure is gone now. What else are we waiting for? If the smell's gone, you'd tell me to take another bath. The shoes. - Where are you going? - Give him a lesson. - Hey, Lukman. - Yes. I command you to stop thinking. If you think of something, you also make me think. It troubles me. So you must stop thinking. Not that one. Come on! Your responsibility is rice. So you take care of it. I'll take care of Kirana, that's the general's responsibility. Yes, General. Corporal, come with me. Corporal, come with me. This is an order. What's going on here? What are you going to do with her? Are you going to kill her? Amazing. You want to shoot unarmed people. Why didn't you knock on the door? What do you want? Nothing. If you tell me to leave, I will leave. - You want me to leave? - Sit down. I want to talk. - You go to the back, Bidah. - Yes. If it's okay, I want hot tea. If it's okay? Why? All you have to do is give us the command. We're your prisoners. - No... - What no? Lukman told me that. That's just his opinion. - I'm not Dutch, I'm not a traitor. - Tell him and let him be confused. He has too many things on his mind. And me. I just came to visit. I took a bath today. I used a peacock brand soap. Bujang said I smell so good and they can smell me all the way in Medan. But I shivered after that. If Bujang didn't hold me, the house could break down. Do you still have malaria? I don't know. But it came like a Medan -Tebing Tinggi train. When it passes, the house will tremble. Sir! Report! Everybody's yelling today. What? General Mariam from Harimau Kumbang division and his team are coming. - But why did you yell? - So you can hear me from behind the door. - Fine! I'll go there later. - Yes, sir! He's the thief who tried to kidnap you before. Will you hand us over to them? General Mariam and his team! General Mariam and his team! What should I do? Is it better if I hide with Bidah? You stay here. - Am I visiting a brother? - You got that right. I knew Kirana was here. I tried and looked for her but someone beat me to it. The only things left were bread and cheese, but I will never forget that insult. I won't forget it either. - So you came here to take her? - Exactly. I've liked her for a long time now. I like her too. Let's have a civil war then. Mariam. Don't start the war because of women. Let's play chess. - If you win, you can take her. - That's good. But you won't win. You can't play chess. You will see. You put the bet on the table. Get her here. Murad! - Get Kirana here. - Yes, sir! Give me the water. There you go. Have a seat. This is Mariam. People in the police department call him "The Wallet". He's attracted to you. This is unnecessary. What for? You're the daughter of a traitor. When his father was active as a thief, your father already fought the Dutch. Leave my father out of it. You really are your mom's little boy. I know you don't like him, Kirana. Who would like this shabby wallet? Naga, watch your mouth. You think you're the only general here? I'm a general too. Look. - Now we're going to start the game. - Let's do it. But how can this illiterate man win this game? Watch your mouth. - Let's start. - Let's. - Where are you going? - Where are you going, Stupid? - I'll eat your rook. - All you can do is eat. You're really an idiot. You can't do anything right. - You better learn from a donkey. - Watch your mouth, Naga. - I could lose my patience. - So let it happen then. Check. I heard your mom was robbed by your dad from Wakandang. You heard that too, right? Murad, stay out of it or I'll chew you. Don't be afraid, Murad. This tiger has no teeth. I'm luckier than you. My father is still alive. But your father is a pair of Japanese sandals. How dare you insult my mom? You, bend down. This is your father's head. This is his eyes, his mouth, I spit on them. Checkmate! What did I tell you? You're an idiot! - Stop! Naga, don't. - You stay away, Murad. This is a war between two generals. Naga! You really are your mom's little boy. Naga! I got shot in the leg. - Is it enough? - Of course. - What about Kirana? - Forget it. May you die together with her. - Baron! - Yes, sir. You're injured. Let me treat your wound. I was worried you would lose in that chess game. But I saw that you were very confident you would win. No. How can I win against him? He's very good at chess. I know him well. So I made him mad and I stole his chess pieces. Why did you become a thief? I wanted to be a robber at first. I bought a big cleaver. I came to the farm foreman on the day he was supposed to pay the workers. I stuck my cleaver on his table. - Then I said, "Hands up!" - Hands up? That's what I saw in the movies. But apparently, I stuck my cleaver too deep on the table. I tried to pull it but it's stuck. I started to worry. I tried to hide my nervousness by yelling, "Give me your money or your life or I'll cut your head off." I don't remember what else. I didn't know how, but he knew that I was in trouble. And then what? "Go home," he said. He gave me five cents. I ran. But I forgot to take my cleaver with me. It was expensive. I suffered a big loss. And then I said to myself. Naga Bonar. You're not meant to be a robber. Be a thief. Do it on a smaller scale. And ever since I became... I became an artist. Naga. Naga, wait. Thank you. - Where have you been? - I came here as soon as I finished. - Lukman really wanted to kill me. - What has he done to you? He told me to carry the rice sacks. Back and forth endlessly. I wanted to fight him but his rank is higher. I can't stand it. As long as he's the major, I will be a corporal until I die. Ranking doesn't mean anything in our fight against the colonizer. It doesn't mean anything to you. But if he told you to carry rice sacks, I bet you would change your mind. What matters is your courage to fight. That's your specialty. Yes. Right. So we can tell which one of us is better. Lukman or I? Let's ambush the Dutch in Parit Buntar. We can't do that. We've made a truce agreement. - What do we care about? - Don't go to war. Listen. Be quiet. She's singing. - Naga. What about me? - Do whatever you want. Kirana said you'd better get inside or you'd be eaten alive by the mosquitoes. Come on in. I didn't know you could play guitar. Just a little. And I can sing too. You have many skills. What else? Stealing. One day the war will stop and we will win. - We? - Yes. Who is we? You and I. The situation will be different. What's your future plan? - Do I have to think about it? - Yes. What do you want in the future? I've been thinking... Because my mom is so embarrassed to have a thief for a son, so I was thinking maybe I should become a police officer to make her proud. But I was worried too. If I become a police officer, people will think it's inappropriate. for a thief to become a police officer. And people might make a slip of the tongue and say, "A police officer becomes a thief." Then not only my mom, but the other police officers will be mad too. I would have ended up in jail. What's important is you must stop being a thief. No. I promise. Even if you put valuable things in front of me, I won't steal it. I like you. So is there any thief who could turn into a good guy? Yes, there is. Is there any thief who ended up becoming the husband of a nice woman? It's possible. Handshake. Lukman! Lukman! - Hey, you! Get Lukman. - Yes, sir. - Lukman! The general's looking for you! - Lukman! - Lukman! - Lukman! - Lukman! - Lukman! - What is it? - Somebody stole my epaulet! Epaulet. We'll make you a new one. - I need it now. - Are you going somewhere? - I want to go and see my mom. - Then you don't need it. Mom won't believe that I'm general without it. My shirt, my pants, my gun, they stole everything. Who's that idiot who stole it? Naga! Bujang left and took ten soldiers with him. When did he leave? At dawn. He said he would attack the Dutch squad in Parit Buntar. He took the horse. So Bujang finally became a general. Mom. So what should I do? I have talked to her. She said she likes me. So you think you're good enough to be her husband? She said so. So please propose to her for me. Mom. Mom. Mom. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Madam. Please come in. Go and prepare the drinks. Have some tea. Did Naga come here? He came here several times. - And he seduced you? - He just talked. - He promised he would stop stealing. - Don't believe him. He promised me to go to school, but he ran away. He promised to go to an Islamic school, but he ended up being a thief. - He promised me he would change. - Don't believe in what he said. His rank is also fake. It's all Lukman's idea to get a permit from Naga to sell rice. - He has been fighting for this country. - He is my son and I love him. But I don't want him to ruin you. I also care about you. Prepare the bed for me and get me the mattress too. A bed? In this situation? In any situation. I'm getting married. - I'm getting married! - Yes, sir. Mom! - Have you told her? - Yes. And what did she say? Did she say yes? No. She was just quiet. What did you tell her? I told her not to believe you, you're a liar. I told her he could ruin her. - That's what you told her? - Yes. I'll be dead. Naga! Naga! How much is the price of the bed that you want? Never mention the bed ever again. Or you will get demoted! How can I get married now? Sir! Bujang and his men have arrived. Sir. Bujang has come back. - Tell him to come here. - He can't. Why can't? If he refuses my order, demote him! He's dead. Prepare for the funeral! We will begin the funeral shortly. Parade! Attention! Attention! We will hear the farewell speech for Corporal Bujang from our respected commander, General Naga Bonar! Attention! We will hear the farewell speech for Corporal Bujang from our respected commander, General Naga Bonar! Go get him. Parade! At ease! - I'll go get him. - Yes. Parade! Attention! Attention! We will hear the farewell speech for Corporal Bujang... Sergeant major! For Sergeant Major Bujang who just got promoted by our respected commander, General Naga Bonar! Bujang. I told you not to go to battle. But you said you want to go to battle. I said don't go to battle but you went to battle. Look at you. Now you're dead. Bury him. Begin the funeral ceremony! I'll go and check. Bujang! Bujang. Naga, don't cry like that. You're the general. You embarrass us. General can't cry? Then you be the general. It's not that you can't. But not too loud. Our troops can hear you and it can ruin their spirit. So how should I cry? Just cry a little. Some kind of a little sob. How can I just sob? My chest is about to explode. - If I hold it in, I'll be ruined. - It's up to you how to do it. But you can't be like this. It could destroy our fight. Bujang! Why did you go? You are now dead, Bujang! Do it again from the start. Bujang! How dare you, Bujang? E key. Bujang. How dare you? I told you not to go to battle, but you still went to battle. Bujang. Yes. Bujang! Don't get carried away in your grief. Every human will die, especially in a war like this. That's true. Not only corporal, even the general will die. What makes me sad is not the death of one corporal. It's just a fake rank that Lukman made up. This is because it's Bujang. I told him not to go to battle. But he still went to battle. Now look at him. He's being eaten by the worms now. That's his destiny. What can we do? It's also true. He's my most loyal friend. If they put me in jail, he'd stay with me there even though he wasn't arrested. He said, "Because we don't have to pay for the food in jail." Now I am all alone. It's over. No. You're not alone. - I'm still here. - I hope so too. But my mom has talked to you. - She said... - I don't care what she said. Yes. I don't care. I will stay by your side forever. Freedom! Help us. Move aside! Move! Move! Where's Naga Bonar? General Naga Bonar is still in mourning and can not be disturbed. General Naga Bonar? Since when did he become a general? General Naga Bonar is still in mourning and cannot be disturbed. - Sir! - Pohan. Come up here. How are you? Come on up here. - Naga, is it true that you're a general? - Where did you hear it? One of your men said so. What does he know? Come on up. Go away. You could cause me trouble. It could mean trouble if everyone made up the military ranks as they liked. - Like Mariam. - Who is he? Mariam, his whole family is a thief, even since his ancestors. He also claimed himself to be a general. That Mariam? He isn't even good enough to become a private. But we will put an end to it. Everything will be organized and militarized. The discipline will be applied strictly. All those fake military ranks will be closely examined. If he's only qualified to be private, he will become a private, even though his rank now is captain or sergeant. By doing so, what was conducted by your troops will never happen again. What is it? Your troops ambushed the Dutch army post in Parit Buntar. Bujang did it. Yes. And we can't let it happen again. It means we've violated the truce agreement... that we've signed before. I told him not to do that. I said, don't go to battle. But he went to battle. - He must be punished severely. - He has. He's dead now. I'm glad you could be firmly disciplined. That kind of violation cannot be tolerated. No. I guarantee you. But if I may say something, if we keep being in this situation, we're stuck. I can't stand it. Naga, our government has its own consideration. And we must obey it. - Freedom! - Freedom! Naga. What is it now, Mr. Jamal? How many chickens did you lose this time? This time it's not chicken, it's my daughter. She's gone too? Who did it? She's not gone, but she's impregnated. - And then? - She's having the baby soon. Having a baby soon? You know who did it? Major Lukman. All right. Don't worry. The war won't end anytime soon. I'll command Lukman to marry your daughter. - What's her name? - Jamilah. Thank you, Naga. - Hey, you! - Yes, sir. - Get Major Lukman here. - Yes, sir. You can't get away with it this time, Lukman. - Hurry. Maybe the war has started. - What is it? Goodness. - Is it true the Dutch are attacking? - Major! Jamilah's father came and told me everything. His daughter is having a baby soon. I command you to marry Jamilah today. It's not true. - It's not true that she's having a baby. - She's pregnant. - Did he say that? - Yes. And he said you did it. Did he really say that? Do you admit it or not? I admit it. I admit that I did it, but not up to having a baby. Fine! She will have the baby later, but she has got to be pregnant first! You're embarrassing us! You have to be punished for that. Hey, you! - What is it, sir? - Get Murad here! Yes, sir. Parade! Attention! To General Naga Bonar, salute up! Salute down! Major Lukman, I have told you that I forbid you to steal. For anyone who steals chicken, goat, or anything else will be punished. You have stolen people's property, something belongs to Jamilah, the daughter of Mr. Jamal. Therefore, you have to be punished. You will be demoted. From major to sergeant major. - I'm so embarrassed. - But you have to be punished, Lukman. If not, what would people say about it? I agree with it. I accept the demotion. But it should be from major to captain, not sergeant major. How could you do this to me? I've given this serious thought. I want you to remain as a major. I couldn't make you a captain major. You would say, the captain major rank doesn't even exist in the military. It would be embarrassing for me. So I made you sergeant major. Even with the demotion, you remain a major. Am I right? - Yes. Once a major, always be a major. - That's right. Naga! Naga, looks like Kirana will join us in the war. - She thinks we're playing a game here? - Watch your mouth, Lukman. I could command you to take a bath and your malaria would relapse. What did Kirana say? She said she would stay by the commander's side in any situation. So sweet. Tell Kirana that her wish is granted. Yes, sir! Prepare all the uniform and weapons for her. All right. We have everything. We have shoes and even a hat. But we don't have money. - But your rice business is going well... - Okay. I'll get them all ready. Now that's the way to talk to me. One more thing. What rank should we give to Kirana? We can't make her deputy general, there's no such thing. Her rank is empress. Did you make up a new rank? What would the world say? Do not interfere. You've ruined yourself, but you still want to advise me? - Whatever. - Are you sulking? It's useless. Even if you sulk, once an empress, she would be forever an empress. Barjo, gather the whole army! Yes, General! Parade! Attention! To the general, salute up! Salute down. Companion in arms. Those who fight on the battlefield or in the rice business. The Dutch has taken over Beringin Tiga, Tanjung Padang, and Muara Pahit. So they've violated the deal they made. We will fight them back for what they've done. - Long live, Naga Bonar! - Long live, Naga Bonar! - Long live, Naga Bonar! - Long live, Naga Bonar! You see? So we will fight them. We will break our promise! - Long live, Naga Bonar! - Long live, Naga Bonar! So we will start the war! Good luck to all of us. - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! To the General Naga Bonar, salute up! Stop. How odd. There's that crazy, filthy guy again. - Captain? - Yes, major? Call over Corporal Pieters. - Corporal Pieters. - Yes, Captain. - Corporal Pieters. - Yes, Major. You said Naga Bonar is dead? Yes. I shot him. One shot and he's dead. - Dead? - Yes, Major. - Dead you said? - Right, Major. See it for yourself. Two Naga? There are two Naga Bonar? Here. - Captain. - Yes, Major. - Get the guys to spread out. - Spread out. Fire. Smoke division! Shoot! - Murad! - Yes, General. Attention, everyone! Damn it, what's happening over here? Damn it. You listen to me, Naga Bonar. I'll get you. You dirty scoundrel, bandit. Spread out. Fire at the left. Fire on the left. - Barjo! - Move forward! - Indonesian youth. - Let's all rise up! Our nation is independent now. The drums of war have started to play. Listen, the motherland is calling you. Indonesian youth, let's all rise up. Our country is independent now. The drums of war have started to play. Listen, the motherland is calling you. Subtitle translation by: Tini Ridwan
