Many many thanks sir. Please write down your mobile number here. My mobile number…For you No, no…Don’t misunderstand me. Your interest payment should reach us by ninth of every month.

You said he is a tough nut to crack… but he Just fell for a few garlands of flowers. Bro, Go to some college, not casino… Why is he sticking like gum? Didn’t I warn you about him? Move... He’s not going to leave you! Just sneak into any class-room fast. Okay… All the best Bye! Need to marry her. What name is Kalaavathi sir? Haven’t heard such a name in decades?

You seem to be living in a trance ever since you met that girl Nonsense He is just jealous I am getting married ahead of him. Getting married? Never told me sir.. Who’s the girl? What man? So much drama unfolding in front of your eyes... it is Kalaavathi man. I am going to propose to her... get married and start my own family immediately… Kishore? Sir... Since Kalaavathi will come here after marriage... safer for you to seek another shelter elsewhere. Later you might think I have become selfish after marriage... and discarding you like use and throw. Sir, forget about me... You just said ‘use and throw’. I am afraid that can come true in your own case, it’s my strong feeling. To hell with your whataboutery! As if you are a prophet like Chinna Jeeyar Swamy.. For all your prophesies to come true. Doesn’t show, but he is full of poison, useless fellow. Oh no! No…Four months since you paid rent -Sir please try to understand... I don't want any reasons I will throw all your things out. No more time. -Sir please… I know what you guys do. You drink all the night. -Sir, please give me some more time. You all brats you are... Pay the rent now or leave my house. -Sir, please... Soumya! Ask him to come after an hour. He can take it all.

You already paid my fees of ten thousand dollars with a kind heart… My bad luck, I missed the one hour by then they now want 25000 dollars more as penalty. What 25000 dollars? No, no…it’s not that you will again bail me out with this big sum. But I can’t bear this any more. I have been struggling since my childhood… I exhausted with these struggles. If I miss these exams, my life’s finished. That’s why... I am done! I had enough and want to end my life now. Just wanted to say a final word before I go. After I am gone, it’s my last wish that you complete all the final ritual formalities... with your hands. Because... I have nobody except you on this planet. Yes. Kishore…. come here. Sir, dirt here… To hell with cleaning that…Come here… What did you say…just before..? I want to die… Not that… No, after that… That I have nobody except you on this planet. Each time she excites me like this with an exhilarating touch. Go…go..Go… Where are you now? I can’t believe it sir… How can it be 25000 dollar penalty on 10000 dollar fees? Why not…Aren’t we extorting money 3- 5 times the actual amount of loans taken? I won’t utter a word more sir if you keep justifying all that she says. You may have given it, but ask more firmly… Stop it man… Don’t make me a cruel husband who keeps a pestering count of every penny given to his wife. Husband, Wife? He seems to have lost it. Why think of dying for such a flimsy reason? I was afraid… that I won’t be able to write the exams What? Fear? Why fear when I am here. No, Sir, a while ago… Please tell me the name of the college… I will come and pay. University of Miami… Department of Information and Technology. Sir... how do you know my college? Well, I followed you yesterday. Ff… Crazy… Why? It’s a boy thing! Please give it. So cute! Give it man… I heard it... I am there for you. Many thanks sir. Yes!

Daddy, he raised his leg to kick me, you have to amputate his leg. Only then will I have peace of mind. He used very bad language about you. Do not give him any money dad.

Why are you standing in the rain? Master has gone for duty, son… He forgot to carry his box, wanted to give him. Give it to me…I will hand it over to him. It’s okay son, why do you bother? Please give it to me, mother… I will give it to him. Where is his office? No office, son? He is just a Night Guard at the ATM Center near Gitam College. Why did you have to bring the box? I told her not to assign tasks to others, but she doesn’t listen. She didn’t order me sir I volunteered myself. -Sit down What Sir? Why this night duty? What is this attire? Nothing son… Last year, I promised around my younger daughter’s marriage that I will construct another floor of the building. My pension goes mostly for household expenses and my wife’s medicines only... So I borrowed fifteen lakhs of rupees from the bank to construct this... Have to pay EMIs no? What’s the loan outstanding sir? Let’s pay it tomorrow, I will arrange. No, no, Don’t want like that. At this age, it is not worth to do night duties like this to service your EMIs… think about it. It’s both fear and responsibility that drives us to repay the loans taken... The loss of reputation that comes from an untimely death is enough to keep a middle-class man in good health...don’t worry What happened? I remembered from childhood, how both my parents used to dread borrowings sir. Yes. and they were always toiling hard every minute to repay every rupee borrowed. Hey Sreenu, is it over…? Sreenu? If whale dates a small fish…how it will be? It’s the same that happened here. Who is it? This is Mahesh reporting from Chepaluppada beach sir. All the fish you sent reached sir. I have neatly sliced them, dressed them well and dried them. These fish are domesticated fully to be reared in your homes in aquariums and fish ponds sir. Don’t send them again into the seas for hunting They won’t return. Because the sea is full of whales like me. I am a whale… Vizag is terrified with a series of these violent attacks. Hardly a day has gone by since yesterday’s attacks that we saw another incident... near Chepaluppada beach where both the sides have again clashed. Rajendranath owes me 10000 dollars sir. When I asked my money back, see how he lost control. Rajendranath Sir owes you 10000 Dollars? Are you joking sir? Why does he have to borrow from you? Good question… That’s what even I want to ask… Tell me Sir… Why does a man who is so rich have to default on my 10000 dollars? Please give my money back sir… please… Hello… -What’s this sir? Such a trivial issue and you are unnecessarily bloating it up. Hey ACP…I can give you even a crore of rupees Do something to him. Why give one crore to me sir when you can just pay him 10000 dollars? Just give him and close the matter He looks adamant don't make it complicated Petty issue sir…Don’t be egoistic. You made a big mess out of it. Did I, Sir? How did I make a mess of it, Sir? Do you remember my body language the first time I came to your office sir? Sir, please, sir…the girl, the loan… And now… Why did it have to come this far, sir? Hey, Subbaraju, where’s my coffee? Ah, sorry I forgot. Bhupal, get some coffee Coffee… Let’s forget the past… I will repay your loan with interest… That’s why, I called you. Super…Here ends the matter… That’s what I was requesting you all along. But on one condition… Hey Subbaraju…order coffee Hey, Bhupal, send coffee… -Fast.. fast.. Tell... You have defamed me and my family by taking to media. Everyone is now questiong why Rajendranath owes 10000 dollars. Press and the social media are talking cheaply about me If I give your money, you will calmly leave... What about all the allegations you made? Hence, do one thing… Confess that you are a blackmailer... And all that you said is false You have to confess in front of the media that neither me nor any of my family members has ever taken any loan from me. You.... Hey Subbaraju…Where’s the coffee man. Nice coffee Subbaraju. Why such an elaborate drama as if I am made to confess to a murder I didn’t commit, Sir? Is that all? Call the press, sir, I will confess it. I have been living like a king in Vizag for the last 40 years without a blemish… And now, suddenly some anonymous fellow comes... and raises ruckus that I owe him 10000 dollars… the news goes viral without anyone bothering to know the truth of the matter Actually, this guy is a black mailer and a seasoned extortionist who targets big business families like ours... Hear the truth in his own words Tell them… All of you please excuse me… I have actually lied with respect to facts about Mr Rajendranath. It is not true that he owes me ten thousand dollars… What are you talking, man? Did you lie about it? What’s wrong with you? You look quite decent in appearance… Why this Blackmail? What Sir? Is media looking like a joke to you? Let’s not leave this guy… Let’s call the police. Yes, let’s call the police…Call them… What do you think about the Press? This is so absurd. Everyone wants to make fun of the media. I don't understand why they keep calling us to these press meetings is just to make a joke. Silence… Silence… please sit down…sit down please Mr Rajendranath actually owes me not ten thousand dollars... but ten thousand crores. What…Ten thousand crores? -Yes. Ten thousand crores of Indian Rupees… That’s the amount he borrowed from me. Until he repays this sum of money to me, I am not leaving Vizag. So... shall I take a break? Government's bid... Ten thousand crores. Sensational news! Noted Industrialist and Rajya Sabha member, Sri Rajendranath owes 10000 crores to an NRI, it is alleged. What are you chilling here after uttering all the nonsense there? You came for ten thousand dollars first… Now you are demanding Ten thousand crores. I am going easy on you because you are an NRI, you bugger. What will you do? What will you do, if I were not an NRI? What will you do, if I were not an NRI? All senseless banter… Hey…You… Hey... Hey... Hey... every advancing step from you will see this guy get a proper bashing. Hey…Stop there. Some people shouldn’t hold onto some things belonging to others. For example, my collar… The other day on beach road, your brother-in-law should have got a beating from me. I left at that because he is Elderly. Now tell me… What’s your problem? I called my baby…She says she only took ten thousand dollars from you, it seems. Yes! She said what she knew… But that’s not the truth. Your baby trapped me in the name of love. Around same time, I was wooed by an hour-glass figure called Jessi who was crazy after me… Jessi was both beautiful as well as affluent, but I rejected her as I went after your baby. She got hurt and married someone else. Do you know how much is Jessi’s networth now? How much? Ten thousand crores… I lost a sum of ten thousand crores because of your baby. Who will give that much money to me now? Will you give? Or your baby? Who ? -My brother-in-law will give you. Brother-in-law will give. Mr Rajendranath... You raise loans for business expansion, no problem. But the loan of 10000 crores you took from that youth is not reflecting anywhere in the company’s books of accounts. You’ve shaken the foundations of my 40 year old company… Who are you really? Where did you come from and why? Tell the truth As far as I know, I don’t remember ever having met you before. Who are you? What do you really want? Why are you doing all this? Are you free now? If so, then come to Delhi immediately… We’ll talk there. Delhi? Why Delhi? I am in the District Central Jail of Delhi. Come over here and we will talk. Sir... Sir... Sir… please can you bring a dozen apples and oranges ? What? Fruits sir…Fruits… the usual variety we take for sympathy visits. Don’t be tense. Everything will be set. Oh, you arrived! So punctual…That’s why you are in such top position. Come, give it to me. Take it madam What are you thinking? I made him return whatever is borrowed. Yesterday, he said he is paying my 10000 dollars. today he gave fruits… soon he will pay 10000 crores also. Don’t worry…Be calm. ma…ma..madam… Oh Madam… why did she leave and go? Please come sir... sit. Please come sir.. let’s sit and talk Do you recognize her sir? No? I met her at the airport when I was returning from America. She was returning after visiting her kids studying in America... And got apprehended by the police authorities at the Airport… Going to take care of some formalities… Please stay right here. There are cameras all over. So please don’t do anything smart. I am also a government officer. you can carry on your duties. I will be right here. Okay! Excuse me... Can I use your phone? Need to make an urgent call. Thank you. Hello Cherri… Mom here… Why are you crying? Don't worry! Nothing happened to me. Take care of the brother. I will come soon. Mummy, please... come soon. Okay... bye. Thank you. Madam... Is everything okay? Later, she told me sir. She is a senior-most Bank official. You have submitted false documents and project report, used all your political influence... to get loan sanctioned for 10000 crores from the bank where she is working in. Later, you defaulted the same loan... but falsely implicated her as a corrupt official who took commissions for sanctioning your loan and got her arrested, it seems. Sir... don’t stare at me like that sir. no, no..I have nothing to do with this issue. you may have your equations and financial transactions sir. But Sir, I was deeply moved when she told me something sir… I felt sad infact I am not hurt because they arrested me. If not me, some other employee would have been arrested. I am saddened only by one thing... Many middle-class people borrow for multitude of reasons- education, agriculture, business expansion from banks like ours. And irrespective of whether they earn well or not, eat well or not, they save on every rupee to pay their EMIs in time. If at all they miss an instalment or two, banks like ours will chase and terrorise them. You would have see many stories of such people in news... whose families committed mass suicide by consuming pesticides for not being able to pay EMIs in time. Actually, they are not suicides... they are genocides... they are genocides by our bank employees. During my service, I would have been responsible for 60 to 70 deaths like this. Whereas, some are looting banks by taking loans for 10000 crores, 25000 crores, 5000 crores, 3000 crores... and pillorying the banks. Money in institutions is getting usurped by individuals. This is how the big wigs in our country are waiting to defraud banks in the form of huge loans. Till date, the total outstanding loans is roughly Rs.13 lakh crores. If only these loans are regularized and repaid... it will give peace to at least some of the bank employees’ ... souls who committed suicide unable to recover the dues. I felt like crying sir. I remembered my parents. Sir, my parents died because they couldn’t pay 15000 rupees loan. You know ? My parents committed suicide just because they could not pay the loan amount of Rs.15000 Now imagine for 10000 crore rupees loan, how many times you may need to die sir? You’re committing a big mistake sir. I will ensure somehow that you will repay the loan before I leave India sir. When you kept repeating ad nauseum the figure of 10000 crore rupees, I was wondering where and when I borrowed from you such a huge sum. You are talking about loan amount? Meanwhile, you actually did me good by calling me to Delhi. Otherwise, I would have struggled to tell you more about influence which you wouldn’t have fathomed enough... Could have become a big headache. Now if you are free for next couple of hours... come with me. This is how Rajendranath’s influence works in the capital city of our nation… You know it right? Anyone who controls Delhi, controls the rest of the country. Do you know what I did with the 10000 crores loan? I gave Rs.3000 crores to the central parties during last year’s General Elections. and I've distributed Rs.1000 crores each to our two states. Remaining Rs.5000 crores was retained in my business. For the next five years, all of them are now my dogs… I will keep throwing biscuits at them A loan is like a daughter sir. As the daughter grows, the father will worry... more about her future about her future husband and mostly what happens to her if he is no more. Likewise, as the loan grows, one should worry and be more fearful sir. Nobody here seems to behave like a responsible daughter’s father Before I leave, I promise you that you will become a responsible father of a daughter sir. It's fix. Listen…it’s a big deal whether I repay the loan or not. we will talk about it later… But tell me first, will any bank official dare to knock on my house, stand in front of the door... and say,”Rajendranath Sir.. so and so, so and so…” and serve a notice. Can he survive after served the notice? So, is the delay on your side all because no notice is served on you? So, if a notice comes to you, you will consider paying, right? Okay sir tomorrow 11 am sharp, notice will come to you… Okay? What are you thinking of Rajendranath? Do you know where my house is in Vizag? It is spread over 200 acres. Usually, someone will fortify home with giant gates and security guards. But I fortified my house with two towns. And you want to reach beyond all that and serve me a notice? Sir, do you take breakfast? I mean, the habit of having breakfast? If so, have a sumptuous breakfast tomorrow and be ready. If the clock shows the seconds hand move even one tick past 11’o clock... you will never see me again. I didn't know how to convey this First you give the notice to this… I come later. Good morning sir... -Good morning Hello Sir… Please sit down. My name is Mahesh sir… I stay in US With regards to M.P. Rajendranath Sir’s 10000 crores which is outstanding in our bank... Wanted to talk about it. Rambabu… -Sir… How many times do I have to tell you not to keep the plate wet? And keep it dry… When you meet big people or deal with big people, it is important to be mindful of who is in front of us and who is behind. Don’t take life risks…Go… Sorry Sir. Sir, I have come to talk about the notice to be served on him for returning the loan. Dear Jaanu, how many times should I tell you not to pour chutney over idly... They are broken. Don’t repeat it again. Come again... That’s it Sir, if you can come with me, both of us will serve notice on him and seek a response. One second. Wonder how she will pack lunch Useless … Do you have an iota of any shame? What am I talking about ? And what are your reactions? Idiot! Sorry Sir… I didn’t mean it. Who are you man? Why are you vandalizing the bank? No notice, fotice…Get out Security…call the police… this guy is vandalizing. This is vandalizing. this is rowdyism. Rambabu… Sir… -Come here… when you deal with public, or talk to public, be careful and just listen. Don’t be at the receiving end of their fury and get assaulted like this Now tell me… Did I really vandalise ? Not at all You have come to request the bank to issue notice to Mr Rajendranath. What really is a bank, in your view? Bank means public… -Yes…public… Public, money… Bank means a temple… Holy place! In ancient past, people used to work hard and earn money but fearing robbery etc, they used to store it in temples instead of their homes… …their hard-earned savings, they believed would be protected by the Gods As civilization grew, banks assumed the role of temples... And in such banks, dacoits and looters like Rajendranath are ransacking the banks by borrowing thousands of crores Don’t you think you have to now play God here by... sending a notice for immediate repayment… How dare you say, no notice, fotice? I'll bash you up. Would you spare borrowers if he were a Software Engineer or a farmer or a small-time businessman? No, right? As the calendar month ends, a person checks the mobile banking apps for fund credits more than the screenshot pictures of their loved ones… whether salary is credited or not... or debtor paid dues or not… Because, only when the funds are credited into the bank account can he be assured of financial security for the family. People can lose trust of parents, siblings or others... but you rarely come across anyone who loses faith in the banking system. And when someone is pilfering the money that is needed to keep faith in the banks... no notice, fotice... If you are all unmoved after what I spoke... either you are fearful or careless if you are all afraid, I will stand besides you all. But if it is carelessness... unless one of you accompanies me to give the notice, I will not move from here. Sir… none of us here, including myself, has the courage to come to Rajendranath Sir’s office. Please leave us alone sir. I won’t move Sir. Notice is being printed sir. I am coming with you. Krishnamurty…Assistant Manager… Service Department Joined in Physically handicapped quota sir. Who told you sir that you are Physically handicapped. You are not sir. Let’s go Sir I will ensure you will be unharmed and back in your seat within the next one hour. It’s tough sir to overcome all these people and move ahead. They may even kill us if we are stubborn. Come Sir, let’s go back… Please let’s go back Sir. Boss…he’s so terrified… almost pissed in his pants. Very good… Tell everyone we will have a party in the evening with food and liquor. Okay boss. Come sir. You never saw a bank notice or were arrogant it won’t ever come Mr Rajendranath sir… Yesterday, you were boasting about your so and so etc... He is Mr Krishnamurty from the bank All the so and so’s about you, he is going to fill and read out to you. listen carefully. Go ahead sir. Honorable Mr Rajendranath… In respect of your borrowings taken for business from State Bank.., the total outstanding loan of Rs.10000 crores has to be fully repaid, failing which, the bank will take possession of all the properties in the name and style of yourself and your companies. That’s all? For all this farce, why were you bloating about yesterday that we have to cross the towns and lakes etc? All nonsensical talk And yesterday, all those hands waving at you like this… don’t mistake it for support sir... it is all butter… Actually, cholesterol sir. Light it and it will all melt in a moment sir. I am forgetting something else... Oh yea… you are not young enough to get sprouts of it again. You have little of it, don’t waste it. Damn! All this happened because of me. I seem to have provoked him... and invited more problems for daddy. He would be annoyed with me right? What uncle, you seem so relaxed when I am so restless.. Who’s Jessi? Jessi? You know only the 10000 dollars he gave you. All the cheap tricks you played on him actually made him turn away from his lover Jessi. That girl has a net-worth of 10000 crores… the same sum that he is asking your dad to pay up now What? -What, what? What do you know except drinking and gambling? Baby... Somehow both of us should catch hold of that Jessi, unite her with that Mahi fellow and solve this issue. Did he give any details? Address…Photo…? I have a plan for that. Welcome, welcome, welcome Mr Mahi… Come let’s have a cool evening. Why are you wearing half pants? It’s a trend, right? Trend? Oh! -Please come.. let's go. Hello, how was the day? Good. Once she knew you are coming, my baby prepared all of these in just half an hour. Come on, uncle… Uncle, did you show him the entire farmhouse? Mr Mahi, all of these are priceless antiques… you want to go around and see? Why, as I can see… Oh, my Mahi…Uncle, didn’t I say? Didn’t I say? Mahi is a raconteur, he can keep cracking jokes that can kill you… Even in the US…time just flew Do you know? Just remembered when you said time… Why are you wasting time? Let’s start Mr Subbaraju... Oh…neat…wow! Sir, you are not touching non-veg at all I don’t touch meat when I am gulping it neat. Everything will come out, with this one peg! Subbaraju… Ok Mahi ji… by the way…who’s that Jessi? Why all that now Subbaraju? I am already perturbed… Leave it. Please tell me sir… please…please. It’s sheer coincidence, Subbaraju You’ll wonder, if you tell about it, you know? Some incidents are just… Then you have to tell it. Then you have to listen to it. Tell me, tell me Mahi ji… c’mon tell me. Jessi lost her parents in childhood just like me. Fearing that her her relatives will kill her for the thousands of crores of wealth, she got support of a Church Father and came to America Jessi loves studies. So much that she can be seen in the library at 2 am, you know? My God! There are some specimens, like that! Why…doesn’t sound exciting? It’s the same story I told you. What? This is what I told him when I was in America. Mahi ji… My baby told you the same it seems, no? Parallel lives, Subbaraju. What happened in my life, happened in your baby’s life What happened to her happened to Jessi too... What’s wrong? Sir, where is Jessi right now? She lives in my heart… What else, sir? She is with you only, right? Subbaraju... are you speaking sense? What will I do if she lives inside of me? Only if she is outside, can I do something with her right? You seem to have invited me here to spoil my mood... shit! Mahi... we’ll wind it up, okay? Even your eyes have become red. So what? The fellow is drunk, so his eyes have reddened is it? It’s been 15 days since I had a wink. Why sir? When I was in America, Jessi used to come to my apartment every evening, fresh as a flower. She used to engage in banter with me, cook for me, and put me to sleep as if I were a toddler. Every evening, I used to stretch my legs over Jessi and fall asleep. Sh…Oh mother.. But ever since I came to India, I know of neither sleep nor anything. Who can I take the liberty of stretching my legs over…who will agree? Uncle, let’s leave. Let’s leave, come. We will get going now... you please relax. Hey Subbaraju... you leave man... I will send her tomorrow. What? You leave now…She will come tomorrow What are you talking? Are you nuts? I won’t do anything to her… Just stretch my legs on her and fall asleep, that’s it. If you want, you stay here. Nothing will come out of thinking hard about it. Either give my 10000 crores back or put me to sleep… like my Jessi Hey Subbaraju…it’s me Mahesh Yeah, tell me. I want to sleep. Don’t try to pull of these cheap gimmicks again, I will break your legs. Put the phone down Okay, I putting down... Where is your brother-in-law? He will be in office, Why? I will call him now and tell him that yesterday you had dropped your daughter to be with me alone at night... and that she came back only in the morning. You, sinner… you will die a wormly death! All sinners will die a wormly death, Subbaraju… Come…and get her. Let's go. As soon as he falls asleep, message me. We will find some information in his laptop or phone about Jessi…It might help us Hey Kala... Just 15 minutes... I'm checking accounts. Come. what will you do all alone? Let some rice simmer in that cooker and make some Sambar. we will chat while we eat I don’t know…And I wont cook. You have to learn and cook Hey Kala, I have an idea... Even if I am on a whim that I won’t eat… you have to coax me to eat something. He slept. Now I will show you. God! Yes, Subbaraju, when are you coming? Veg…Non-veg… Why only cooking for me every day? Okay, carry on, carry on, it’s sleep time. I already spoke to the farmers, sir You can start your work from tomorrow. Is it six o’clock now, Sir? Yes Sir, Why? Subbaraju... didn’t you see the time? Mom... Mom... just put your leg on me. What? I am unable to sleep…just put your leg on me. Put my leg on you? Yuck…hey…take it away… it’s not at all matching. Show me once you complete all the designs… I will... Okay sir. Hey… I am in a meeting now, I know it… I will bring her at 7.30 pm sharp. put the phone down. Uncle, this is Baby here. Baby, what’s up? Did he call you? What? What are you talking about? Just in case, whether I should get ready or not? What?? Why, are you getting so addicted to the routine? Instead of being happy he didn’t call you, why are you pining for his call? I will gorge your eyes out… Put the phone down! Just received mail sir… Supreme Court grants a stay on Rajendranath against the notice we issued We know what usually happens with folks like this sir… That’s why we also stopped reacting. Rajendranath here... Rajendranath here… Rajendranath here… Now announce my name to the whole country… Did you read the stay order? It says all proceedings against Rajendranath must be stopped at least for 6 months Do you know what it means? It means that no matter how many thousands of crores that Rajendranath borrows from banks and defaults... he should get infinite time to pay it up but should never be asked to repay it back Nobody can touch him, that’s the summary. Hey, what did you say? That a loan is like a daughter? In my view, loan is like a concubine You know how we handle a keep? Use and throw…That’s all.. In my business and career, every rupee I earned, I earned it this way only – borrowing from banks and reneging on payments All these loans and the losses made after writing off such loans the banks already know how to cover them. And the government knows how to protect people like us. Why do you bother in between? Do you know why I got a stay order for 6 months only? Next month, the Parliament is in session for passing a bill to write off one lakh crores of NPAs. Which includes my 10000 crores loan too So, because you messed with me, the country is losing one lakh crores, get it? Daddy... is the money demanded by Mahi the loan you borrowed from banks? So, do we have to pay the banks? No need to pay it now. What are these? Blank cheques... 22 of them. Every birthday of mine, my dad has the habit of gifting me blank cheques I realise now that you are fighting for a good cause. But you are not safe here. As my dad is a really tough guy… So take these cheques, solve the issue and get away from here to safety. Tell me the truth. Didn’t you forge your dad’s signatures? I didn’t expect anything better from you! Okay, dear I will change for good… It is human nature to change. Give some time. You are still a kid… You don’t get involved. I will manage it. Hello Sir, what kid? These are 22 cheques, 12 cheques… How many cheques do I give now to earn the tag of a grown-up from you? Will 70 or 80 suffice for you? Stop saying, just a kid! Hey Kalaavathi… If I had known that will fall for just a leg of mine, I would have put it on you, long back! I know you will, you will… Hey you…Give me five measures of jasmine here. Madam…money… Money? Sir will pay you. Take from him Thin boxwood flowers for you, by Monday, Jasmine Flowers bouquet for you, by Tuesday. Marigold flowers plait for you, by Wednesday Multi-hue flower bouquet for you, on Thursday Hey Sir, let’s party with Jasmine floral bed on Friday Hey Sir, Bring it on, the Gold flower fragrance on Saturday But by Sunday, land on my lap And stick into my plait, six floral garlands, And play around with my beauty.

Ma…Ma…Ma…Ma… Ma…Ma….Mahesha I’mmm ready and coming on to you. Stop right here... Get down. Why did you put on a double lock? It’s not Sir. We have put it. Recovery Agents here. We came from the banks you took the loan from. Since you guys are not keen to pay EMIs for two months now nor inform the bank... we came looking for you. Nothing of that sort sir. my wife’s been terribly ill for the last two months, most of the money went for her medicines and tests... Next month, I will pay everything due, mortgaging everything I have. What are you going to achieve now by repairing this old lady? Giving ill-health Reasons for your wife, for your keep! Hey, who are you man? I was your wife’s boyfriend when she was in college. After me, another fellow called Suresh tried to woo your wife. Did she fall for him or were you just lucky? Hey, bugger what you blabbering about my wife? Then why are you talking about his wife, fellow? They have been toiling day and night, working multiple shifts to make good their loan payments and you greet them with threats. But send courteous emails and requests to buggers who evade thousands of crores from banks? Sir has two months’ EMIs outstanding… Let me see how you ask for it. When will you pay the EMIs? Sir... your EMI’s are outstanding for two months now… You can pay in two ways… Either, please pay at the bank or give us a convenient time for us to come and collect the amounts from your house. Now, leave. What is this Sir? You didn’t agree when I offered to pre-close your entire loan outstanding. You didn’t have to see all this farce in public. This is the house…Stop right here Hey…Who is that fellow? Come out of the house. Who was it who manhandled my person when he came for loan recovery? You think it’s a joke or what! Taking loans and defaulting on them?! Sir, can you please do a favor for me? There, he is the one! What dear? Why are you raising your hand? We are also capable of raising hands and all. Calmly pay the EMIs and say sorry to my guy. Master Sir…Tie the board. Petrified at the sight of a knife, is it! Actually, do you know who is a Recovery Agent? The one who can dig you out from wherever you are – from the seas, sky... or the netherworld and make you cough up the EMIs – he is the Recovery Agent. And you dare lay your hands on a Recovery Agent! No Entry for in this house for Bank employees or Recovery Agents? What does it mean? What drama is this? You’re driving me mad, just remove the board. Remove the board I say! What is it that went into the stomach? Where is the glass in your hands? What is it, sir? How did you do this? How will it come out now, Sir? You are a Recovery Agent right? Recover it now. But what is this glass all about? Why are you talking to him, bro? Just finish him off. He is taking every thing we speak in a flow, too seriously, Sir. Yes, so what? Glass…its not after all…Crazy fellow Corona (Covid19) didn’t spread in crowded bars and theatres how can it spread if schools reopen? Hey, you… My dear Naidu… Come here Didn’t you already know that his hand will hit hard? Yet you brought me here, right? He was just having tea… Had it been Coconut water, imagine! Recovery… Recovery… Recovery… Recovery… Look, son... we are all waiting only for you… Why are you leaving? Heard you got into a scuffle in the afternoon? There is a procedure to implement any new rule in this colony? And there’s a President for it. Who are you to unilaterally design and affix new boards? Recovery Agents were creating a trouble in front of Master sir’s house... So, you can bash them up is it? Won’t they come knocking on the doors if you haven’t paid their EMIs? You can’t behave so irresponsibly here, this colony is home to officials, it is not a bazaar… Mind it. Officials? Who are these officials, sir? Officials means... Ohh…You mean those who served earlier as officers? Don’t you all pay EMIs? Of course, we do… But we pay on time. How much do you pay per month Sir? Rs. 38000 Ok, last year, how much did you pay sir? Last year? 37950 rupees… Why did it go up by Rs.50 this year sir? Ohh, because you are all officials... you won’t mind if it goes up by fifty or hundred rupees Our country is full of such “officials” sir. Whether EMIs go up by 20 or 30 rupees... or levies like ATM charges, credit card charges or late fees etc... we don’t bother Do you know where all these sundry levies collected are funnelling into? It is going to the poverty-stricken People… like our M.P. Sri Rajendranath… When people like him are borrowing 3000 crores... 5000 crores or 10000 crores of rupees from banks... and defaulting as NPAs, all the above charges collected from us is subsiding the big loans. Even then, let’s not mind it Sir because we are all officials. What are you saying, man? All these losses are borne by the public? What else sir? State Bank of *** bad loans for 2019-20 is Rs.16000 crores Union Bank of *** – Rs.24000 crores Bank of *** – Rs.9000 crores With so much of losses, how do you think all these banks are managing to survive, sir? Do you expect the Bank Chairpersons to sell their personal assets... or whether government is making special budget allocations for these? We are allowing it… Officials like us. When we slog our butts off... and paying our loans, willy-nilly, with Mortgaging every bit of gold and land we’ve got... we are paying our Loans as well as on behalf of all those loan defaulters too. Yet, we will not speak a word. we are officials… slave-like officials. He has been an ordinary school teacher teaching students for 50 years... but still works night shifts to pay his EMIs. When such a person is asking for a two months’ reprieve to pay up his dues because his wife has fallen ill... it is unacceptable. But when someone like Rajendranath evades paying 10000 crores, 25000 crores, it’s alright. Maybe he is a bigger… I am not a big official like you sir... but a tough nut. I am going to bend him backwards and cough it up from him. I promise. Until then, the Maths Sir will not pay his EMI and that board will remain as it is. “Here comes Government Auction Rate!” “It starts with a Nod by the son of Allure surname” “Here comes Government Auction Rate!” Since the early hours of today morning... the mega city of Vishakapatnam is witnessing a massive rush of people queueing outside all the bank ATMs and branches. People are withdrawing their monies from their accounts. Everybody’s saying only one thing… ”Until Mr Rajendranath repays the Rs.10000 crore bank loan, none of us is going to pay a one rupee of EMI.” What are these? Boards. Everyone is tying them in front of their homes. If you display these boards outside your house, we won’t have to repay any loans or EMIs, you know? Let us also display them… outside our offices and factories, everywhere. Unless all the banks, which are established by the people, of the people and for the people, demonstrate that all types of borrowers are treated equally, the people of Vizag said they are clear they won’t repay or service any outstanding loans henceforth, this is Sanjana from Vizag. What's this? What’s happening in Vizag? Sir, the customers of banks in Vizag have done a mass boycott. Approximately EMI, Rs.23000 crores due this month to various banks is stuck Until Mr Rajendranath pays up 10000 crores to the banks, nobody wants to pay their dues If this agitation spreads to the rest of the areas in the country and if the people begin to react on the financial crimes it’ll be a big trouble for India sir… It may lead to financial emergency too. Hello sir… Hello, Rajendra… The party will not tolerate lapses like this which bring disrepute to you in public image All bank transactions should take place as usual in Vizag Otherwise you will have to repay a loan of Rs 10000 crores If the issue is not resolved, you will be thrown out of the party And you have to resign from the Rajya Sabha also. What? I was the one who helped you form the government. And you dare tell me even about my Rajya Sabha seat also? My foot! Rajendra! You are losing your control. Shut up! Shut up! I know very well what to do and how to do. By tomorrow morning, every fellow in Vizag will queue outside the banks and pay up the Dues. If not, don’t call me by name! Keep the phone down. Pay your EMIs by 11 am tomorrow and take your kids back, okay? Why? -Buy another one... Hey, who are you...? Lakshmi! Lakshmi! There is a complaint against you under Anti-Social Element Act. Central Intelligence team wants to see you… A small enquiry... Let's go. What’s this? What enquiry? what has this lad done? Where’s the warrant? Why, you think it is some Missing or Pick pocketing case to issue a warrant? Anti-social elements act... the one have to come unconditional Do not teach me about the rules You seem to have grown your clout in Vizag as a leader. Did you ever hear of a person kidnapped from every family? That’s what is happening in Vizag today There’s a lot to settle scores with you. Come... Master... It’s only a small enquiry… Let me go and come back. No, Mahi…I fear something... -It’s okay Master sir… Let’s go. You are an imbecile that collecting a dime or a dollar for petty loans in America... why do you care if I am usurping loans from the Indian banks! Let me give one last chance to you Stop everything here right now and go back to America calmly I know how to buckle the people here to pay up the loans. Don’t make me a mass murderer of so many innocents. You seem to lose your marbles already You are terrifying now, right? You’ve kept so many people under your control. And kept me at point blank range too Why are you still bargaining? I get it Sir. You are running scared. Let me guess… let me guess... It’s not you, it’s the mistake you made – that you are really afraid of.. Me, being afraid? Me, being afraid? You are going to die now. I'll make everyone in Vizag pay up their EMIs queuing up outside the banks... All the best. What? All the best to your entire team. Sir, Sir...Stop it sir. why do you bother? Don’t! Police department will take care about him. Come Sir… Hey, let’s go. Sir, I made a promise… That I will make you a good father of a Daughter. I will make you the best father in the country sir. You... -Sir, sir…Stop sir. Satyanarayana… nobody should even get a trace of his body, understand? Make his body drenched in blood -Come Sir…Let’s go. Hello! Hello…Subramanyam... why is the bank sealed? Sir…even my bank is under seal A stamp of one rupee is affixed on it sir. Tell me... Sir, every bank in the city is under a seal and shut each seal bears a one rupee stamp What to do? First try to break atleast one bank branch. By 11 am, the first EMI in Vizag has to be deposited, understand? Who the heck is inside, let’s see It is not enough to make people paying EMIs You will also need bank employees to make the transaction. It’s not over until you polish off someone fully... Not enough if you just assaulted them! Do not have the raw nerve to shoot you sir. Everybody here is a victim of somebody trying to default on bank loans. We are all in these cosy jobs because of the loans taken by our hard-working parents. Sir, you have to ensure that the scoundrel pays the loan. Sir, I have killed many people with this gun. but today, the bullet shot out of this gun is not for you. Well, that’s what happens when you have fans everywhere Look after them. Especially with people who wish well for public and care for them. Is it? If you try to stop us now, then this fellow is gone. Sir... you please go and sit at that cash counter. Hey, it’s not 11 am, I am giving you time till 5 pm until the close of business hours. Even if you can cut one receipt out of that book, you have my neck on line. You… come and try your luck. Come, you oldie... Fill the form… It’s as if you guys just barged into a room where a bridegroom just popped in 100 Viagra pills to take on the first night action. Come on! Boss... this guy’s bashing up everybody with ease. Bloody bugger. Do not let him in... Let's kill this idiot right here. Who the hell are you? Hey, move... -Finish him off. Hey, where are our boys? Rajendranath is coming towards One town. Don’t fear, sir…We’ve reached the city outskirts. What do you lose if you pay that 10000 crores sir? Will you lose your assets, your villas or your cars or anything sir? Sir, imagine a fisherman who ventures out into the high seas to catch fish and doesn’t come back for few months. Even he is sure if he will return. But if he nets thirty to forty thousand fish in his expedition If he pays just five to six thousand rupees EMI, some of that includes what you evaded, sir. Likewise, school teachers, Bus conductors... businessmen, employees, farmers... all of them who pay their dues with their savings are paying something for your bad loans as well, sir Sir, I know that all these laws, courts and government will not make a difference to you Because businessmen like you are so influential that you guys decide who the country’s next Prime Minister, or a state’s Chief Minister From growing with political muscle, you guys have grown so big you call the shots in politics as well. Who can really do anything against you sir? Sir, it’s not my intention to hurt you, destroy you or kill you... If it was so, I would have left you with those fellows in the bank for 5 minutes... You have to transform yourself. And pay off this loan. Then more people will see you as an inspiration and pay off their dues at least once in six months or an year You have always lived off the country... Please do something for your country sir. I know you can still escape your punishment for this felony. But I can tell you one thing sir... If you pay off the loan and come to Vizag, the city of Vizag will welcome you differently... If you don’t pay, the welcome will be quite different. It's up to you. Sir, one should have an element of fear when taking a loan. Our heart should swell with pride when we are repaying it. All your life, you were stuck at the place where one only fears. Why don’t you try, feeling proud of repaying sir. it gives a Good feeling. This is absolutely a victory led by the public. Finally, the noted industrialist Mr Rajendranath has relented... to the pressures of “Bank Boycott” movement of the public witnessed over the last few days. Public and Media friends, please forgive me. Bank Manager Rajakumari madam has no role to play in whatever has happened. Hello Madam You met me as a stranger in Airport. but managed to solve such a big problem of mine I can’t thank you enough for what you did. You have done so much for me. Who are you? My parents happen to be there in the list of all the sixty to seventy people who died because of you madam. Madam, don’t you already know how bad the crop has been this year? Stop there, man… Will hunger stop growing because this year’s crop comes a cropper? Or, will you stop eating? You have four days’ time to either pay up or die…Think It is not your fault, madam. You did your duty… If the parents are distraught, the children also become restless madam. When I saw you speaking so soberly with your children. I recollected my childhood. I wouldn’t like my situation to repeat in others’ lives madam. hence, all this… now watch this, madam... Henceforth, it will be tough for defaulters like this to thrive, your banks needn’t run after them the public will look after them. From now onwards, “Government Auction Rate” is a clarion call not just for the common man but for everybody. Take care, madam. What is this man? You’ve thrown the whole office in disarray during just fifteen days of my absence. No trace of an account or a ledger. What is this? Sir, I was just updating the software What did you update? Can’t see a thing over here. Hey, why did you come back again? You’ve destroyed everything… We stopped giving loans. We moved into another business. I didn’t come for any loan -Then what? I am feeling sleepy. Feeling sleepy? So what? Either go to your room and sleep or make a room and sleep. will you come and sleep in the office? Kishore, you are still not getting it. It’s been fifteen days since I had a wink. Look at my eyes, they are so red. I am going to die…it’s crazy. sir, are you hiding something from me? Hey, Kishore… -Sir… Just stop everything for half an hour… I will take care of her. Sleep when you are sleepy… How can you resist that? Damn! Oh my god! He has fallen from grace so much that he is now giving loans and recovering them through other barter system. Only God can save him now.
