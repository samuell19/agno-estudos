INSPIRED BY THE REAL STORY OF JENNY COCKELL "" MY LIFE, IN ANOTHER LIFE "" See you soon, Father, thank you. Let's go! Quickly! -Bridget, hurry! -Wait for me ! Wait for me! How are you, Sonny? Just! Are you alright? Okay, the Russels are here. I need their project. I'm ... working on it. You said it was going to end yesterday. -Well, I'm a little late. -You can't be a little late! Doug, I don't know. Is that... I do not feel well. I'm still having those dreams. Right. I will tell them that we need more time. I forgot to come and get you. How did you come home? Brian brought me. Why didn't you call me at the store? -I can come home alone, mom. - It wasn't a problem, Mrs. Cole. -See more colleges? -IS. -Where are they? -In California. I thought you were thinking about Stroudsberg. You were the one. It's a good college, Kevin. It is in Lehig Valley. I do not know why... I don't want to stay in Lehig Valley, mom! Said? Brian's brother is going to buy a new truck and sell the old one. -How old? -It's 91. That's 1,200 bucks. It has 216 thousand km. It needs some adjustments, but I can do it. From 91? They said that if I added the money, I could buy a truck. 216 miles? Dude, another year and I'm out of here. -I have to go. -It's all right. - See you later, Mrs. Cole. - Bye, Brian. What's wrong with you? It's those dreams again, isn't it? Every night for the past few weeks. Today, it happened at work. It is not normal to have dreams like this during the day. Course is. I do this in every Calculus class. The money is mine, mom. I want to buy that truck. All those years of trying, all those doctors. -I didn't think it would be possible. -Me neither. How long have you been? Six weeks. I do not believe. We always said we wanted one more. -Yes, when Kevin was 3 years old. -It just took a little longer. Is that all you're going to say? What took a little longer? What do you want me to say, Jen? That was not in the plans? The plans will change and that's it. Our life will change. The important thing is to keep your head in place. Aren't you worried about becoming a father again? The only thing that worries me is business. We have spent the past 20 years preparing for this. We have 8 months to make it work. If we don't get that ... I don't know what I'm going to do with Kevin's college or the new baby. Good night dear. A shilling, mom. Look. I worked an extra hour. That's why I was late. I won two more pennies. I want you to stay with them. Hide it. Don't let the father stay with them. No, Sonny, you worked hard for him. That money is yours. But I want you to stay with him. It's ok. She looked like me. It sounds crazy, doesn't it, mom? You are pregnant, dear. You have the right to be crazy. I saw this. In a dream. It is a church. I think it's in Ireland. You dreamed of Ireland when you were a little girl. I just talked about it. It drove your father crazy. "" Your Irish family "". The dreams stopped when you entered school. Maps of your Irish city. You lived drawing them. I don't know why I kept them. Well, you drew that when you were only six. Oi. He's coming. He went to get the documentation. Where is Daddy? He said he was coming. Do not come. He had to check the Owens' work. It looks great, doesn't it? Well, I have the $ 1,200, but I need to borrow money for the pieces. Maybe 400 bucks. Kevin, something happened. We don't have any extra money now. I will buy anyway. What happened? I'm going to have a baby. What? I'm Pregnant. -Not even! -I found out a few days ago. You will become an older brother. -Yeah. -Kevin, I got the documentation. Whatever that means ... - Did you find it? -I found it, of course. Legal. It's all here ... Come on, Sonny. Come on, keep up the pace. Check the trap that is there. Quickly! Did you get one? -I have to kill him. - Did you get one or not? What the hell is going on there? What should I do? I can't tell you what to do. The trap is yours. You have to decide. You have to decide. We don't have all day! Ready. Patch, patch! Don't tell anyone, mom. Please. -I promise. -Now, that's enough! It's late! Let's go! And never tell him. Not even a word. No, Sonny. Never. To nobody. I promise. Kevin, look at your mom. The doctor said that getting pregnant at You must have been very happy. -Yes. -Of course. Mom said you won't have any money to give me for the pieces. You mean California is out of the question too, right? -That's right. -Great. This child was not even born and is already ruining my life. Don't say that, Kevin. Not the end of the world. -For me it is. -Enough. Thanks. Did you ask Dr. Wickman about your dreams? He said it is common to have strange dreams when you are pregnant. But I don't think it has to do with pregnancy. Jen, you are taking this too seriously. Kevin. Are you alright. They're just dreams. They don't just look like that. Seem what, then? What do you see? They are always the same, with a family in Ireland. I've never been there, so I really don't know, but ... Where in Ireland? Any place ! Now, what question is that? It's a geographical question, Doug. Very funny, Maggie. Very good. Do me a favor. Don't encourage that. -Where do you think it is, Jen? -I don't know, mom. You know what? I have an old ouija board in the closet. Do you think that would help? Don't you see how ridiculous this is? But. Malahide? Thank you. Hi. I'm Jenny Cole. I ordered a map, and they called me saying he had arrived. I'll check. I'll be right back. Excuse. It looks like there are four children. Sonny is the oldest. He has... 1 2, 1 3 years. I feel like she loves them so much and ... but there is something else, something ... very dark. -That's crazy. -It's not crazy. Yes it is. Found it. It is a topographic map of the entire Malahide area. Look. The village. It's the same. The road... The church... Here is the station. The roads are the same on both maps. And look, here's Swords Road. This is Malahide. Did you draw this alone? -And didn't you know it was Malahide? -Not. -Hi, you have a book ... -Excuse me. It's real ! If Malahide is real ... so who are these people that i keep seeing? Are they real, too? I bought that book for you. It was written by Dr. Christopher Garrison. He teaches theology at the University of Pennsylvania. -He is also a hypnotherapist. -It's about reincarnation. No mother! You have never been to Ireland. He drew things when he was a child, and again as an adult. Garrison says that nobody has dreams like that. He says they are memories. They couldn't be memories. I'm not saying that I believe. I'm saying... that can help explain what you're feeling. I'll call you later. -Bye mom. -Goodbye. Where is the money? Where is it? Very well ! I know you have money. Give it to me, you runt. Leave him in peace. The neighbors will hear you. I don't care if the whole Swords Road hears me! Stop! He's just a little boy! About himself! Leave her alone! It's up to you! Is not? Let's go. Give it to me. Let's go. Give it to me. Give me the money! Mom, are you okay? -Jen! Congratulations. -Thanks. We can go shopping together. I found a great baby store. Everything is on sale. That would be fun. Right. Goodbye. We had a meeting an hour ago. Sam Casey, remember him? Residential real estate entrepreneur . Will build 5 houses on River Road ... and is looking for someone to build. Do you remember him? I'm sorry. I called. Where were you? I cannot do this alone. You have to be here. -We need that client. -Doug, I want to talk to someone. Gary? The delivery date for the Le Bridge project has been moved to the 4th. -Doug ... -It won't be a problem. His name is Dr. Christopher Garrison and he is a hypnotherapist. -Check the pantry details. -It's all right. Use hypnosis to treat anxiety, confusion and emotions like that. Wickman said you are fine. Why worry about dreams? -Memories. -What? In this book, he says they can be memories of a past life. It may be reincarnation. Let's talk about it at the office. He has a PhD in Theology and another in Clinical Psychology. Does he believe in reincarnation? Everyone in the book had memories of previous lives. Everyone in the book is crazy. I think maybe ... I am the woman in Ireland. The mother of that family. Hear what you're saying. Do you have any idea what you're saying? I'm not asking you to believe it, Doug. I just need you to support me, that ... to try to understand that I need to do this. OUR PAST LIVES What did you say to Casey? That something must have happened. That you are the most trusted person I know. Even in high school ... you were dressed, ready, waiting for me. Did you think I expected you? They lived in a place called Swords Road. The Irish family. I heard that in one of my dreams. I checked the map. There is a Swords Road in Malahide. -How could I know that, Doug? -I don't know, but reincarnation ... This is something I cannot accept, Jen. There's a lot going on with us. If talking to this guy will help you forget about it, then ... go. I better get back to work. You can relax now. You read my book, so you know how I like to work. I record each session so we can review them later. Sometimes the person says something that seems insignificant ... but sometimes the most improbable detail can be verified. Now, Mrs. Cole ... we need to find out what you are seeing ... what are you feeling. And then we can judge whether they are true memories or not. We can start? I'll count backwards , from five to one. When we get to one, you will hear only my voice. Five. Deep. Four. Very good. Three. Deeper. Two. Almost there. A. We are going back to Ireland. Back to the time of your existence in Malahide. Okay, Jenny. You are safe. - Are you in Malahide? -Yes. -You are alone? -Not. Who is with you? Two of my children. It's all right? Not... No, there is something wrong ... There is something wrong. Let me help you, mom. Sonny, take care of your sister. -Bridget, how are you? -Mary ... -Oh, our ... -Mary, are you okay? Mom! Elizabeth, come! Quickly! I can't ... I can't breathe. Mr. Muller, a glass of water, please. It looks like a boy. He doesn't want to settle down. Mrs. O'Neill. Thanks. Baby. Five, four, three, two ... A. Her name is Mary. Sim. She was pregnant too. I want to schedule a series of sessions ... if you are interested in continuing. I think there is something here that is worth exploring. I have an hour next Tuesday. Mary O'Neill ... Studying in another state, aren't tuition fees more expensive? The chosen colleges offer several financial aid packages. I bet yes, but we are in a position to take out a loan. -It is possible to postpone payments. - We don't want to do that. His grades are high enough to try discounts and scholarships. We can follow this path. -Right. I think we can. -Sure we can. What about housing expenses? And the trip? Getting back and forth is a lot. Some plans include housing assistance and travel expenses. We can request these specifically. We should see some of the other colleges close to home. I don't want to be close. I want to live there. I'm going to get a job and work for a year. I'll pay for it myself, if I need to. Mrs. Cole, I understand your concern ... but the fairest thing would be to choose what Kevin wants. Going to the west coast may be the best thing for him. That hurts ! Good girl! -Is the doctor there with you? -Yes. Yes. Can he do anything for you? Not... Not... Very well, Mary .... Strength. Strength. Let's go! Soon. It's a boy! It's a boy! It's blue. He's blue! I'm so sorry. Oh, my baby ... It's all right. It's all right. She will not survive another pregnancy. You can't take it. No more children, John! You have a good family. Four healthy children. Give thanks for the blessings you have already received. Five... four... three... two... one. Here, Jenny. -This can not be happening. -It's all right. It's okay, Jenny. Jenny, listen. The strength and depth of the emotions you experience ... like this Irish girl ... lead me to believe that her life really existed. You can find out who she was ... when she lived ... how your life now is linked to her life. These are not dreams, Jenny. They are your memories. What happened? He was so small. A very small boy. It was so sad ... What little boy? Mary had a son. He was born dead ... and I was holding it. I could feel him in my arms, I could ... I could feel his death in my heart. This is the feeling of losing your own child. It's okay, Jenny. He was my son. That was my life. -Hi. -Hi. -What are you doing? - Reading about Ireland. Trying to find out when Mary lived. Who is this? It's Mary's daughter, Elizabeth. Grandma said that when I was a little girl ... I called all my dolls Elizabeth. She swears it's true. This is so weird. Do you really believe you reincarnated? I believe enough not to ignore it. -But I can't say I understand. -IS. I can't understand it either, but ... you were so small. How could you draw these things? When does daddy arrive? I want you to see something in the truck. Not that, I need to go. The meeting with Sam Casey. I was late to find your father. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Do you know that place you built in Fairview? -That's what I'm looking for here. -Okay, no problem. But I want a cleaner look at the end of the block. A more modern design. Jenny will make some drawings, which will be modified until she is satisfied. -Great. Well, can we go? -I'm almost finishing. -So, Doug, how's business going? - So far, so good. Smart move to open your own business. -I had to do this, you know? -IS. -I know the feeling well. -It's going well. We have about four projects underway at the office. She is fine? 17 of... janeiro... -from 1 932. -Great, Geoffrey! Stop, Frank. It will ruin the clothes before I even finish. -I won't, no. -Yes, yes. You ruined all the coats your mother made for you. -I spoiled nothing. - Yes, it did. -Why did you do that? -What I do? What are you doing? A new coat for Frank. Why don't you finish after and come to the room? I can't, John. The coat can wait. Leave the needle there and come with me. No, John. Not! -I sent you to come with me! -And I said no! You will do as I say! Leave her alone! -Sonny, no. Not! -Don't threaten me, boy! Don't hurt him. Leave him alone! No, no, John! No, John! Please! The children! Not! Do as I say! -No, please! -Let's go. Get in there! -Not! -Lay in bed! -John, no! -Mary, do as I say! Want one more? I told you to shut up! No, John! Not! Please! Come on, Mary! Jenny... Jenny, Jenny ... Jenny, what's wrong? What's it? -It's not over. -What is not finished? What is not finished? He knew that she couldn't have any more children. -She will die. -Will not. No one is going to die. Listen! It is not real. None of them are. Even if they were, they would already be dead. Not! They may still be alive! -What are you talking about? -I heard Geoffrey say. Era 1 932. The children. They may still be alive! Hello? Hello. Thank you for returning the call. No, no, he called in good time. -I'm just going to get my notes. -Who is it? The priest of the church of Saint Joseph in Malahide. Yes, yes, Father Kelly ... I am trying to find a family who lived in Malahide in the 1930s. The last name was O'Neill. The parents' names were John and Mary, and I believe they had 4 children. Yes, but in Ireland the churches have an archive of the ancient records. Can there be a birth certificate, marriage certificate or death certificate? Something that can tell me what happened to them. It's three in the morning! Can you check the files and send me an email with what to find? Jenny... Ah, you don't have a computer. Well, is there anyone who can see this for me? No, I understand, Father. Thanks. Thanks anyway. Mail arrived. What's it? I sent 1 4 letters to families with the name O'Neill in the Malahide area. None of them know anything about Mary. - Did you tell them about your dreams? -Not. But he said it was important that I find them. Mom, I don't understand. Are you Jenny or are you Mary? I believe that... I am Mary's reincarnation. I was Mary in the afterlife, and now I'm Jenny. -How she died? -I do not know. But the memories are growing stronger. -Why? -According to Garrison's book ... the spirits that reincarnate need to return to continue evolving ... it is because you need to resolve some unfinished business. I'm sure this has something to do with children ... but I just don't know what it is. The farmer wants a wife The farmer wants a wife Get a good wife Get a good wife. Get a good wife The wife wants a son The wife wants a son The wife wants a child Get a good son Get a good son Get a good son I love this one. And you sing it wonderfully. -I also like this song. -We know. We just sing for it. Hey, let's wait! You should be at home, in bed. Need to rest. No. I need to be with you. Little is missing. Have you chosen the baby's name? Gregory, if it's a boy ... and Phyllis, if you're a girl. I would like another sister. I will see what I can do. Sonny... if anything happens to me ... Nothing will happen to you. Sonny, you have to take care of the children. Mom, stop! It's gonna be okay. You are the oldest. Promise me ... that will keep the kids together. I promise. -What happened? -Oh me... I got a hot pot. Nonsense. I was distracted. -Are you alright? -Mom... she knew she was going to die. She knew she was going to have to leave them with that animal. It made Sonny promise to keep everyone together after his death. Phone calls, letters, but I can't find them. I don't even know if they're okay. Excuse me. Hi mommy. -I knew you were coming today? -I brought... three airline tickets. I want you to go to Ireland. All of you. What? You have to work this out, not just for you, but for Doug and Kevin. They need you. You're right, I'm living in the past. I'm not here. You are going to have a baby and you need to be here. Find out what happened to Mary and her children. So, you can go back to your life. Ah, mom! Thanks. And the hotel, the food? -We'll have to rent a car. - We can solve this. You are pregnant. You can't go to Ireland. Dr. Wickman said I could go, if necessary. And the store? Suzanne takes care of sales, and Gary takes care of projects. Call every day. Not even. No way. -I can't do anything here. -And you can't do anything there! -I'll. -Be going alone. I'll. Did the whole family go crazy? Listen, you're Jenny Cole! It's not Mary O'Neill. This is Kevin. He's your son, not Sonny, Frank or whoever! This is the family I believe in, in this life! This is real to me. I don't believe in reincarnation. That means you don't believe me. Welcome to Malahide. Legal ! -Do you even know where the hotel is? - It must be this way. Mom! - Wrong side of the road. -Watch out! Look where you are! -Excuse me. -Excuse me. Can go. Mom! -Continue here. -What's still here? The butcher shop. Mom? Where are you going? We haven't checked into the hotel yet. Oh my! Look at this. She brought her children here every Sunday. Hi, I'm Father Kelly. Can I help you? Hello, Father. I'm Jenny Cole, from the USA. And this is my son Kevin. - We talk on the phone. -Yes, Mrs. Cole, what a pleasure. Kevin. Oi. -Come to look for the old files? -If there's no problem. Come to the residence. That's where the files are. Are the O'Neill related to you? I need to find out. How are you doing? - They didn't find it. -Not. -I'm sorry. -Me too. Did you try the Record House in Dublin? Maybe they can help. I tried, but they had nothing. Are you sure they lived on Swords Road? Have. Malahide is a small town. Ask around. Maybe someone knew them. It looks like it must be around here. Does nothing here look familiar to you? This is Swords Road. -I think their house was here. -Are you sure? Somewhere around here. It was a long time ago, mother. I think they demolished the old houses. Excuse? I'm Jenny Cole. Could I ask ... about a family that lived in this neighborhood? -Not? -I'm sorry. Okay thank you. Goodbye. Thank you. I'm looking for the O'Neill family. Excuse me sir? My mom and I are ... -Not? Right, thanks. -You're welcome. Thank you for your help. No one has ever heard of them. Just two days. We don't ask everyone. I think so. Come on. What are you doing? I'll be right back. Hi, I'm Jenny Cole. US A, right? You can always tell by the accent. I'm staying at the Dunleavy Inn. Do you live here in Malahide? Sim. So, maybe you can help me. Well, it depends on what you're looking for. I'm looking for a family, the O'Neill. John and Mary? They lived on Swords Road in the early 1930s. They had 4 children: Sonny, Geoffrey, Frank e Elizabeth. No, I'm afraid I can't help. I came to Malahide in 1995. He lived north of Killybegs and Donnegal before that. Thanks anyway. -Where are we going now? - Back to Swords Road. I want to try again. There, baby Phyllis. I will take you to the hospital. I love you all so much. And I want you to know ... that wherever they are ... I will always be taking care of you. Mom! Mom! Damn it, mom, what are you doing? It went straight to his rear! I have not seen. Okay, stay here. I take care of that. Hi, sorry. Damn it! I don't think she saw you stopping. I'm really sorry, man. Our car is rented, so ... Hey, are you okay? I need to find them. -Hello? -Hi Dad. It's Kevin. Kevin, what's up? It's all right? Not really. We were in a car accident. - Mom was driving. -She is fine? Are you alright? Yes we are well. -What happened? -We were... approaching the "Stop" sign, but it didn't stop. She was traveling. Like that time with Brian, but worse. -She is there? -He went back to the hotel to sleep. It happened a few hours ago, so ... Did you find them? -No not yet. - Didn't find anything? Do not. Kevin, I want you to get on a plane and go home now. -Dad, no! - What do you mean, no? Dad, I saw the church. -What church? - Mary's church in Malahide. It is just like the drawings that Mom made. Kevin... She couldn't have drawn it if she didn't remember. Has no way! I think you should come here, dad. She need's you. -I fell asleep. -I know. Do you feel better? Yes. From now on, you drive. Perhaps your father was right. -Not! -What else can we do? Voltar a Swords Road. It's a waste of time. Call all the O'Neills in the phone book from here to Dublin. We already did that. Go back to the church and look at the records again. Kevin, there's no trace of Mary O'Neill on Swords Road in Malahide. There's nowhere else to look. I'll walk around. Be right back. It's all right. Mrs. Cole! We almost didn't find it. Arthur McSweeney. We met at the pier this morning. I was worried about you after the accident. It's all right? Yes I am fine. I called some friends of mine. DescuIpe. This is Thomas Layden. Nice to meet you. Thomas grew up on Swords Road. He lived a few houses in front of the family home he was looking for. I knew Sonny. This was all a swamp. And there was a stream that passed under the bridge over there. Well, now he's dry, like me. But, years ago, families brought buckets here to get fresh water. -Where did you live? -So after the stream. -How many families lived here? -20 in total. A small group of houses. It's this way, this way. Be careful not to hit the branches. We are almost there. This is where they lived. She will not survive another pregnancy. She can't take it. -I said no! - You will do as I say! Leave her alone! Sonny, no. Sonny, no! Wherever you are, I will always be watching over you. Remember your promise, Sonny. Remember your promise. Where did they go after Mary died? I never knew. But are you sure they lived here? Yes. First Sutton, then Duffy, then Brennan ... These Sutton? Was it Mary Sutton? I thought it was O'Neill. No, no, no. Sutton. John e Mary Sutton. How much do I owe? Oi! -Lets go in. -Right. M ARY SUTTON M ÃE ADORAD A DEAD ON OCTOBER 24, 1932 TO 37 YEARS OLD Let's go! I won ! Mom, can I play with Sheila? It's Mary. You found it. I missed you. I felt yours too. It is like. Mr. Layden said that the children were all baptized here ... then there must be a record. Now, with the right name, the notary can help you find. Come on, Kev, there's more in the other room. May I ask why you are looking for a family that is not yours? The Catholic Church doesn't believe in reincarnation, does it, Father? No, but it doesn't mean that we do n't accept an occasional miracle. An extraordinarily rare phenomenon . I'll tell you what I believe. I believe that our soul does not die. And although I personally do not believe that one can be born again ... it could be possible, in the most extraordinary of circumstances ... for a spirit to speak through another person. This woman's spirit could be speaking through you ... to find your children. This is not exactly reincarnation, you know? Think of a broader interpretation . I found ! Look here. Baptism records for all of them. You're right, these are baptism records. The parents were John and Mary Sutton. They had five children: Phyllis, Elizabeth, Frank, Geoffrey... -and John Junior. - This is Sonny. I'm sorry, but I don't know any Sonny Sutton. He is not a member of our parish. I also don't recognize the other names. He doesn't come. You don't know if Sonny left the flowers at her grave. I'm sure it was him. Can be. I'm a little afraid to find him. I don't want to disturb his life with all this. We are going back to the hotel. We will try again tomorrow. Come on. No, you go. I need a few more minutes. Sr. Sutton? Sr. Sutton? Sonny? I know her? Do not. But I know a lot about you. About your family, your father, your mother ... -your brothers ... -Do you know my family? They lived near Swords Road. You crossed the bay by boat to work on the fields. And his mother was waiting for his return on the bank. Who ... Who are you? Sorry, I'm not doing this right. My name is Jenny Cole. I'm from Allentown, Pennsylvania, USA. And I remember you and your family ... through dreams. -Dreams? -I hoped we could talk. Mr. Sutton, please. I just want to talk to you. Please. But I don't want to talk to you. I know it's hard to understand, but ... I just wanted to see if you were all right and to know about your brothers. I don't know what happened to my brothers. I haven't seen them in 65 years. -But I thought you ... -I don't want to know what you thought. And I don't know who you are. I am not going to talk about my family with you or anyone. He says he knows me, but he doesn't. You don't know anything about me. I know you let the rabbit get away. His mother was pregnant. You and Elizabeth were with her at the butcher shop. She was in pain and you ran to her side, took her hand. And then a woman asked for some water. And when the butcher came, he ... He said "" Mrs. O'Neill "", and your mother took the glass. That was what made me think that his last name was O'Neill. How can you remember my mother 's life as if she were there ... when did this happen? Father Kelly believes that the soul ... Mary's spirit is expressing itself through me. But now that I know the right name ... we can find others. You can talk to them, ask them to come back ... Not me... I don't know what it all means. But it is too late now. It's too late. Sonny, hope. I can't see them. I spoke to Frank again. He will come to meet us at the church tomorrow. We talk about you too. -I bet he doesn't believe it. -Not even a word. But he wants to see the family. What about Sonny? Every week, he drives an hour to drop flowers at her grave. But he doesn't want to participate in the reunion. I do not know why. The train has arrived. That must be her. Well, let's say hello. -Elizabeth Sutton? -Sim. Hi, I'm Father Kelly. We talked on the phone. Nice to meet you, Father. And this is Mrs. Cole, the woman I told you about. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Cole. Jenny. Please call me Jenny. And you can call me Bessie. Bessie. Hello, Sonny. Can I talk to you, please? -Do you remember my father? -Yes. Those are sad memories. To this day, I blame you for my mother's death. I was afraid of him and those memories for a long time. Now, I just feel sorry for him. He had a wonderful wife and family ... and never loved them, never participated in their lives. It looks like my mom talking. Sonny, I came here today ... to say that we found your brothers and sisters. I'm sorry to say that Geoffrey died ten years ago. We have his death certificate. But the others are still alive. Phyllis moved to Wexford many years ago. She'll be here tonight. And Elizabeth arrived by train this morning from Kilkenny. And Frank will be arriving from England tomorrow. We will all meet at the church. No, no, no, Mrs. Cole. Sonny, why do n't you want to see them? After my mother died ... my father put us to work in the fields. He rented us. The others were so small that they couldn't do the job ... and he hit them because of that. He was always drunk or angry. Then, one night, after he passed out ... I took them to the orphanage. They said they would accept my brothers, but that I was too old. Ah, Sonny. I knew they were going to separate houses and that I would never see them again. But I didn't tell them that when I said goodbye. I ran. I left them there. I came back a few years later. I couldn't live with what I had done. But Dublin was so big ... there were so many people. I had no money, I didn't know where to look. I disappointed my mother. I disappointed everyone. She was desperate ... or I would never have asked you to do that. You had no choice. I promised her that I would keep the family together. You have the possibility to keep that promise now. Come to the church. Thanks for visiting, Mrs. Cole. Father Kelly is here. Elizabeth is with him. That must be Phyllis. -You can tell them ... -What, are you going to leave already? -Yes. -It's going to be all right, Jen. Relax, mom, you 're making me nervous. Will be all right. What's it? Mary always felt guilty for leaving her children ... for not being able to support them. Maybe that's why I always wanted you close to me. She didn't get a chance to see them grow. I am very lucky. Go to California, Kevin. I actually thought about staying home for the first year. I can study at Penn State. I can go home on weekends , be the big brother ... help in the store and things like that. I can request a transfer later. You don't have to do that. I know. Let's go. Gosh, is that Frank? It must be him. -Yes. -Let's go. Phyllis. Elizabeth. After all these years ... I never thought we would meet again. You did a glorious thing, Jenny Cole. Whatever the explanation ... you did a glorious thing. -It's great to see you again. -Really. Sonny! Sonny? Elizabeth. E Phyllis. Phyllis, Phyllis... I... Frank. Sonny... The McConnell farm was on the other bank. I went to work there when I was nine. I still remember my mom waiting for us here ... when we came back across the bay. Thank you for finding us. Thank you for bringing us together again. You know, the last two days ... made me realize that not all memories are painful. Sometimes, before I went to work ... my mother and I would take a boat in the bay. Just the two of us, alone in the water ... with the sun rising. It was so peaceful. So beautiful. Do you remember that, Jenny? Sim. It is like. When I grow up, mom ... what kind of man do you think i will be? There are people who believe that people are born the way they will always be ... that you are like that as a child and as an adult. I think you will be the kind of man you are now. Kind, thoughtful ... someone who loves people and that people love. I'm very proud of you. I love you with all my heart. And I will always love you. -Have you decided? -Or Penn State or Bloomsberg. -Bloomsberg. -Why? Stay closer. You will be home early on weekends. It has a lot of service! Doug... Look at my little angel. Oi, Allison ... Hi darling. Hi sweetie. Kevin is taking good care of you. I have to go. -Bye mom. -Bye, dear. - Bye, grandma. -Goodbye. See you. Very well. This is for you. Take it, hit Allison. Hi, pretty. Look here. She is doing this now. Did you see that? Doesn't it look like you? Look. "" Dear Jenny ... I received Allison's photos with today's letters ... and I wanted to tell you that you have a beautiful girl. I can't wait to meet you when you come to Ireland in the summer. O Frank, a Bettie e a Phyllis... they said they’ll try to come too. And I'm sure that this time they will bring their families too. I'm really happy to be part of your life, Jenny. I lost you once when I was a boy. I don't want to lose you again. I'm sending you a picture. I found it in an old book that I hadn't opened in years. It's my mother's. I want you to have it.
