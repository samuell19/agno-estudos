Three hours there, three fuckin' hours back. I know how far it is. Well, we're running a family business here. We need your help. - Open up the station-- - May. Go open up the station. - Fuck you. - Hey. You see, May? That's why we need a car wash. With all the extra cash coming in, we can buy ourselves a robot Cole. Just shut up, Bobby. Get the baby. Fuck!

Are you mad at me? No, buddy, I'm not mad at you. Then why'd you swear? I don't know. Mom said never to swear, not ever. You know, your mom's a smart lady, Rocket. But one day when you're older, you'll realize that sometimes, it's okay to swear. Like when? Like when you're really, really mad, it's better to swear than to do something worse. - Like hit somebody? - Yeah. Exactly. So I'm just gonna hit this golf ball instead. Whoosh! Okay, here, you try. What was that? I have a vagina! What did you just say? It's what Bobby said when he slammed the door. Okay, you know what? You should never do what Bobby does. Why? Just trust me, okay? Here.

Alright, I'm Dr. John Jackson. And this is Creative Writing: The Short Story. Now, for most of y'all, this is gonna be the first college class of your lifetime. - Y'all? - Yeah--yeah. It's a contraction of "you" and "all"--y'all. I was speaking colloquially, Miss, uh -- Serafina. Serafina Church. Do you mind if I speak colloquially, Miss Church, hmm? No, not to be rude, Mr. Jackson, but I was expecting that someone of your literary success would be more careful with his diction. Well, I'm embracing my Southern heritage, okay? Well, so does Maya Angelou, but you don't hear her talking like she's on a plantation. Are you sure you've got the right class? I think Debate 101 is down the hall, hm? - I'm sure. - Okay. Well, if you'd kindly keep your ideas fresh for your short story, because four students, next week, are gonna bring their stories in to be read to the class. And just to be completely unfair, we're gonna start at the top of the alphabet and work down. So that means Alison Anderson, Nathan Benn, Cole Chambers, and Miss Serafina Church will bring your stories and read them to the class aloud. Now, on to bigger and brighter things. You can't be a writer unless you read, so there's a reading list associated with this course. I told you to watch the popcorn. Now it's all fuckin' charcoaled. I like it charcoaled. Oh. How can you-- How can you eat this shit? I mean, it's-- it's fuckin' unedible. That's the way I like it. What? Dark and burnt, just like the, uh, reminder in the front yard? You don't mean that. I don't? No. Why? Because I love you. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. When I get that car wash, I'm gonna marry you, Maybelline. - Yeah? - Uh-huh. - Hey, are you nervous? - Excuse me? Are you nervous about bringing in a story, having to read it aloud to the whole class? - Not really. - Oh. Well, I tell you what, I'm just about shittin' my pants. I mean, not--not really... Uh, I'm Cole. You're Serafina. Right. I got to go. Well, I think it could... Yeah, okay. Um, hey, I'll see you next week. I'll be the guy, you know, shitting his pants. ♪ Way, way down My family tree ♪ ♪ Lives a young gunslinger Named Wild Bill ♪ ♪ He was a big, strong... How'd you feel after Saturday? Like I got run over by a truck. - You scared me, man. - Whatever. Don't give me that crap. You got to be more careful, man. No, I'm a grown-ass homeowner now. I don't need you to take care of me, Dad. I was just scared, all right? If you want to kill yourself, you know, I can find a new best friend to drink beers with in this beautiful yard. - Just-- - Beautiful, huh? - Beautiful. I love it. - Good luck. You can't hold your liquor and you're ugly as shit. - Hmm. - The only reason I hang out with you is 'cause no one else will. - Mm. - I can't believe it. I finally move out of Granny's, and what do I do? Buy a house in Lytton. - So... - Hmm? - You got in that class, huh? - Yep, I got in that class. Well, you promise me, in 20 years, you come visit me and my brood of nine kids and trash-talkin' wife... - Nine kids? - You can take me for a ride in your Mercedes. Oh, no, no. It's not gonna be like that. You wanna bet? Yeah, it's gonna be a DeLorean. - A DeLorean? - A DeLorean. Dang! Alright, then. Cheers to that. - Nine kids? Nine kids. - Yeah. - Nine kids. - Better get started on that. "He stood frozen in the road, the lights of the truck growing larger. His mother's voice called out to him, penetrating the darkness, but he didn't move. Somehow, he couldn't. All he remembered was the moment she pushed him to safety, the moment she took his place, the moment of impact. The boy stared down at the woman, sprawled at an impossible angle on the concrete, waiting for her eyes to open and tell him everything was gonna be okay. "And he waited. And he waited." Um, that's--that's the end. Okay, Cole. Good work. Unfortunately, we're just about out of time, so we can't critique it. Serafina? Okay. "'In the Looking Glass.' The old folks had always reacted strangely to her. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, like, four flats of the cola. Rocket, stop it. And, uh, two-- two flats of water. That will be great. Okay, great. Thursday. Alright. Bye. Um, thanks. Stop it! Rocket, stop it! Uh, it's $3.30. From $20. Okay. I don't have any bills left. There you go. Please. Hello? Yeah, just hold on. Jesus, Rocket! Sit down! Bobby! Just sit--sit-- sit on this stool right now! Bobby! Bobby, get Mary Kay! Sit on the stool! Mom. Mom! Come here. Come here! Come here! "The little girl now stared at the black-and-white photograph in disbelief. That was her, dark-skinned, right in between the two pale-skinned kids. For the first time in her life, she saw who she was." Okay, everybody. Good work. Uh, remember, bring me your hard copies of your stories, okay? I got to give you your marks. Miss Church, if you could just stay behind for a couple minutes, I'd just like to talk to you for a sec, if I can. That was, uh, very interesting, yeah. - Chambers. - Yes? Did you like Miss Church's story? - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. Yeah, I liked it. - Except... - Except what? Nothing. You are a bad liar, Chambers. Go on, get out of here. Good work, Cole. Keep writing. Now, Miss Church, uh, let's -- let's talk about your story and influences and stuff. Where--where did you get the idea for that? - Hey, did you get in trouble? - Yeah. How'd you know? Uh, your story was kind of the same as a--a chapter in "Their Eyes Were Watching God." It's--it's a really great book. - I know. - But I really liked how you sort of made it your own, you know? Jackson didn't. Yeah, well, who cares what he thinks? It's not as if he's a great writer or anything, right? - Right. - So, Hurston was a--a really strong feminist writer way before her time. You've read Zora Neale Hurston? Yeah. I think she's right up there with Faulkner and Hemingway. But underappreciated because she's a Black woman? Yeah. Definitely. Maybe this whole creative-writing thing was a waste of time. Really? I just got stuck, you know? Do you get stuck? Next thing I know, I've got a story that's practically written by Zora Neale Hurston. - I mean-- - Well, don't worry. It happens to me all the time. - Yeah? - No. So, why are you taking this class? Um, it's something I've always wanted to do and never thought I could. I'm a fan of DeLoreans myself. Sorry. What? N--nothing. Can I ask you something? - Sure. - Okay. And don't take this the wrong way. Oh, okay. Would you help me? - How? - With the class. You mean be, like, your study buddy? Sure, study buddy. Saturday afternoon, here on campus? I don't know. Come on. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Oh, and Cole? I really liked your story. Why do you think there aren't any Black drivers? I mean, they got the women in it now. I suppose that renders Rocket useless, eh, May? I guess we're gonna have to get baby Mary Kay her learner's. Damn, she is pissed at you, ditching work like that. What? Hell, if I'd have done something like that, I would have been punched through the wall. Leaving your family in the lurch. May, if you've got something to say to me, then say it to my face, okay? I'm taking time off to take this class. You have responsibilities here, Cole. Give my shifts to Bobby. I already gave Bobby next week off to work on his business plan. His business plan? What? A car wash in Lytton? You've got to be kidding me. It's my research week. Fuck your research week! At least he's looking out for our best interest, not driving three fucking hours to some holier-than-shit university. I'm gonna take this class, and I'm gonna keep on taking it, and I don't give a shit what you say. Hey! Don't talk to your sister like that. I quit. You walk out that door, we're not gonna let you back in. Okay. Bye, Cole. This is ridiculous. Stop being so selfish, Cole. Selfish? I've done everything for this family, May. What about everything that this family has done for you? You are not the only one who has sacrificed. What has your sacrificing got you? Oh, that's right. You got a redneck boyfriend and two kids. Hey, Mom. I love you. You going to Mars, buddy? Nah. Mercury. Mercury? I guess it's warmer there, huh? Yep. See, uh, Rocket, I'm not gonna live here anymore. Why? I just--I just can't. I--I can't. I don't want you to go. I'm just moving up the road with Frogger, right over there. You can come over and watch cartoons anytime you want. This piece of paper has got my number on it. It's top secret. You don't tell anybody. Put it in your pocket, don't lose it. - Okay. - Okay? Alright, come help me load my truck. Let's go, buddy. I brought the rocket with me. Well, we'll put it down here for now. Oh, look how high you jumped. Go sit over there and help me move all this stuff. I want to go with you. You got to stay here with your mom. She needs you. You don't want to be around nobody with no values. He's a bad influence. Aren't you, Cole? Now get in the house, you big baby. Whatever you say, big man. Come on! - It's not working? - No, it's not working. - What about this? - What? Is it plugged in? What the hell are you doing? Breaking ground for the car wash, baby. Jesus Christ, Bobby. We don't even have a loan yet. You know how much this is gonna cost, right? Yeah, 20 grand. And you know what we need to do to get that loan. No, I thought you were getting that. - Jesus Christ, Bobby. - Wait! Hey! - Whoa! - This is your thing. You said you were gonna write the business plan. You said you were gonna handle all of this. Yeah, well, Deebo's got experience - in construction, all right? - Yeah? Then why are you about to drill above a goddamn fuel tank?! - To think I had faith in you to build this fuckin' thing! - Hey! Wasting our money. No more. You bitch. You can talk back to me when you're the one who provides for this family, okay? Holy shit. Dude, that was crazy. Pick the fuckin' thing up! Yeah! That was awesome! Okay! Okay, not to brag or anything, but I'm just about the best goddamn lawnmower man in the Interior! Okay. Okay. 3, 2... - Whoo! - Yeah! Whoo! It's about time you left home, buddy. I'm proud of you. I won't even charge you rent for living with me. What? Are you serious? You're not gonna charge me rent? No. Just make me some waffles every once in a while, okay, sugar tits? Oh, you love my tits. Hey, babe. We're gonna go smoke. You want to come? - Mm, uh-- - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. - I don't-- - Come on. - No, that's okay. I'm okay. Okay. That's never happened. - She's a hottie. - Hey. I'm gonna take a piece of the pie tonight. Georgie, you are the king. - You are the king. - Hey, Georgie. Don't worry about that. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - You all right? You are a good man. I bet you do, bud. You know I'm gonna build my own car wash? That's nice. Yep. - Shotgun! - Okay. - Fuckin' shotgun, shotgun. - Okay, kids. This is how it's done. Yeah, babe! Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug! Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug! Whoo! Come on. Come on. Come on. Just put it in there. Just give it to me. What the fuck are you doing? Oh, just trying to get to know you a little bit better, pretty lady. Well, don't fuckin' touch me, man. Ooh. Smell like flowers. Yeah? Well, you smell like rotten teeth. Now fuck off! Get the fuck away from me! Aah! Son of a bitch! Don't fucking touch me! - Hey, hey, hey, hey! - Fuck you! I will fucking kill you! - Hey. - He fucking grabbed me! Yeah, no big-- no big deal, brother. Just keep your bitch under control. - What was that? - Yeah, she's a slut. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! - I'll right now! - Bobby, get the fuck out of here! - All right. I'll fuckin' drag you right now, man! Yeah, this party sucks ass anyway. - Yeah. - Let's get out of here, man. - Get out of here! - You fuckin' whore! - Fuck you! - Fuckin' prick! She was asking for it. She was, like, begging. She was like, "Bobby, come on! Give it to me." - Hey, hey, hey, hey! - Come on! Hey, hey, hey, hey! - I'll fuckin' drag you all! - It's not worth it. - It's not worth it. - Shut your hole! Bitch! Come on, come on, come on, come on. - Let's go, let's go. - Get out of here! Everybody just relax. You're a fuckin' prick, Bobby! Fuck you! Fuck you! Whoo! - Alright, man, grab a beer. - Frogger, you all right, man? - Listen... - What happened? Aah! God! Fuck, kid! It's 8:00 in the fuckin' morning! Hey, don't touch him. Don't touch him! I'm not gonna hu-- I'm not gonna hurt him. What the hell happened to your hand? Oh, just some fuckin' bitch decided she was-- Aah! - Hello? - Cole? Stay there! Yeah, Rocket? - Stay right the fuck-- - What's the matter? - Can you come over? - Hey, was it a bad dream? - Don't touch me! - Rocket. Hey, hey, what's going on? Was it a bad dream? - No. - You stay right there, okay? I'm coming right over. - Okay. - Okay, bye. Cole. Come here. Are you all right? Stay in the truck, okay? - Jesus Christ, May. - It's nothing. Nothing? I'm gonna kick the shit out of that asshole. Look, just go. Take Rocket. We're working through it. - May, if you don't leave him... - I'm a big girl, Cole. ...he's going. Yeah. All right. You ready? - Oh! - Hey. Oh, hey. - And who's this? - I'm Rocket. Hi, Rocket. I'm Serafina. - That's pretty. - Thank you. Hey, are you and Cole study buddies, too? - No. - No? He's my nephew. I hope you don't mind. I sort of got roped into babysitting. No, no. I just, um--no, he's, uh... - He's... - He's my sister's. I mean, she's not Black. I mean, her ex is. Well, he looks like you. - What? - I don't think so. No, I don't think so either. Let's grab you a book, huh? Wow, you must have all sorts of interesting things to write about, Cole Chambers. Is that what you always do? Turn real life into fiction? Like your, uh, like your story in class. I'm sorry. I didn't-- I didn't mean to-- No, no, no. It's--no, it's fair. What I usually do is, um, I take something from my life, like an event or a memory, and, um, I try to turn it into fiction and then see if I can formulate it into a story. - These are my books? - Yeah, this is the right one. Okay. Pardon me, but what does this say? "Definitely beautiful." - Definitely beautiful. - Definitely beautiful. Got it. - You know what? - What? I heard a poem once about how everybody should know how to spell "definitely beautiful." Do you think you can spell it for me? - I can try. - Okay. I'm sorry. Do you--do you have a pen? - Oh, yeah. - Try to spell it. Here you go. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Does that make any sense? Like, I mean, you just write about what you know? Yeah, yeah. I mean, sure. It's just, you know, nothing exciting ever happens to me. Okay, um, I--I don't really believe that. You know, Hurston had a life. Just--just real life with incredible struggles. I just live in this perfect house in this perfect neighborhood and have no struggle at all. You can write about any life. Just tell the truth. That's good, but you missed a couple of letters. He's having a little bit of trouble. Oh, would you like me to help you? Yes, please. Okay, here. Just to get you started, okay? Then you have to do the rest yourself. - That was pretty good. - Hey, she's helping you out. Take a look.

What about him? What about--tell me about him. He had his family in California. When he found out about Rocket, he was great. He even offered to take him. I don't want Bobby to know this, but... Tyler sends a check every month for Rocket. I put it in a special account for him. Are you serious? That's good. Why don't you just leave Bobby? I mean, he doesn't do anything. Why don't you just throw him out? Bobby had it rough when he was little. - Yeah, so? - He wasn't lucky like us. And you know what? He is a lot less violent when you're around. You're a lot like Dad in that. You just--you can just calm everything down. Let's just sell it. May, let's just sell it. We'll put Mom in a home. It'll be easier on all of us.

She belongs here. - Where is Mom? - Bobby's watching her. Bobby's watching her? Mom? Oh, Jesus Christ. Mom! Be right back. What the fuck?! Oh, you're gonna hit me now. All righty. You ready?

Do you ever feel... ...like everyone in the world is depending on you? Yeah, that's happened, yeah. Okay, so, what did you do? Well, I did everything wrong. I spread myself too thin. Instead of doing one thing that I could do really well, I did five things I didn't even finish. I lost a book deal. Lost a couple of really good friends. You know, it's like you get into this thing where you're trying to help other people, and you're not helping. You're just making things worse. So start by helping Cole Chambers. You know? And then you'll be in a position where you can help other people. So, that's my million-dollar advice, and I wish you'd reconsider, man, 'cause it's been a pleasure having you in the class, huh? Thank you, but... I don't think I have a choice. Well, at least tell me that you're gonna be back here in the fall. Yeah. Yeah. You're a terrible liar, Chambers. Just terrible. So you had to give up class? Yeah. Um, my sister needs me at the station, so... That's really courageous of you. - Courageous? - Mm-hmm. That's too big of a word for me. Besides, you know, you don't, um... you don't know my family. Oh, I want to meet them. No...no, you don't. How about we go for a--a swim in that crazy pool of yours instead? You just want to see me in a bathing suit. Yeah. Yeah, I do. I'm--I'm not gonna lie about that. I--I really want to see you in a bathing suit. Okay, well, before you meet my bathing suit, you have to meet my parents. House rules. - What? - You know what? I would--I would love to. - Really? - Yeah. - You're not afraid? - Should I be?

Um, Mrs. Church, it's so great to finally meet you. Uh, likewise. So, Serafina tells me you're quite the writer. I try. Are you planning anything else besides the class this summer, any internships? I, um-- I had to drop the class. Really? Yeah, I gotta help my sister run our gas station. Couldn't she just have hired a manager? It's complicated. Or is it just that the class was a little harder than you expected? Mom! You know, when I was your age, my father passed, and I had to go to work and help my brothers and sisters. It's an admirable thing to do, help your family. I assume you won't be returning to university this fall. I mean... I hadn't really-- Shit! Uh, where's your bathroom? Down the hall. Excuse me.

Hell, my loudmouth girlfriend, she's pregnant, and I live in a shack. There ain't nothin' more white trash than that. You know, Cole gave up his class, his girlfriend, his opportunity to get out of this piece-of-shit town all 'cause you couldn't figure out how to run a gas station without him.
