Festival De Cannes Best Actress By: Nizar Ezzeddine Warning: Ocr'd from 1XBET version which has ads! Just for experimental use. A film by: Joachim Trier ﻿THE WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD A film in 12 chapters, a prologue and an epilogue ﻿You've been through the epidermis, derma and muscles. ﻿PROLOGUE ﻿Julie disappointed herself. This used to be easy. ﻿She was still among the top students. ﻿but there were too many ﻿interruptions, updates, ﻿feeds. ﻿unsolvable global problems. ﻿She sensed ﻿a gnawing unease she had tried to suppress by cramming ﻿by drowning it in digital interference. ﻿This was wrong. This wasn't her. ﻿She'd chosen medicine. ﻿because it was so hard to gain admission. ﻿Where her excellent grades actually meant something. ﻿But then she had a revelation. ﻿Her passion had always been the soul. ﻿The mind, not the body. ﻿Surgery is like, so concrete. It's almost like being a carpenter. ﻿But now... ﻿My passion has always been what goes on inside, thoughts and feelings. Alt was like a window had opened. ﻿Not anatomy. If psychology will make you happy, then do it. ﻿I think you're really brave. ﻿I can't take it anymore. I don't want to. ﻿She left him. ﻿Though he was devastated, ﻿he had to respect the way she took control of her life. ﻿She observed her fellow students. ﻿Norway's future spiritual advisers. ﻿Mostly girls with borderline eating disorders. ﻿Say you're at a party. ﻿She still felt trapped in the role of model student. ﻿All this cramming. ﻿When was life supposed to start? ﻿What's your name? ﻿Julie. ﻿The person's name is Julie. ﻿Let's say Julie and I meet at a party, ﻿and we feel a mutual attraction. ﻿Hypothetically. ﻿Actually, she was a visual person. ﻿Now I know. ﻿I want to be a photographer. ﻿A photographer? I see. Julie spent her student loan on cameras and lenses. ﻿﻿As long as you're serious about it. ﻿No safety net. No holding back. ﻿Need help? ﻿She took a temp job in a bookstore. ﻿Started a photography course. ﻿Super! ﻿She made new friends. It felt like coming home. ﻿Suddenly Oslo was a different city. ﻿New places. New faces. ﻿Hi. Aksel. ﻿Right... ﻿You're the comic book artist? She'd heard he was the creator of Bobcat. Sorry, I'm a wild animal. ﻿Have you read it? ﻿Yeah. So? ﻿She pretended she'd read it. ﻿She only remembered one strip she'd found vaguely sexist. ﻿I know what you mean. ﻿Nothing's ever good enough. ﻿The only thing worse than all the idiots is yourself. ﻿But... If we go on, I'll fall in love with you. Then it'll be too late. Maybe we should agree to... ﻿stop seeing each other. ﻿The problem is our age difference. I'm just afraid we'll fall into a vicious circle. You're much younger that I am. ﻿You'll start to question who you are. ﻿I'm past 40. I've entered a new phase. Whereas you still need time to find yourself. ﻿You don't need me waiting. You need to be completely free. I'﻿m just afraid we'll hurt each other. ﻿Later she said that was the precise moment She fell in love with him. ﻿Shall I put your bag in the bedroom? ﻿Yes, please. ﻿I have two copies of a book! ﻿Huh? ﻿Yeah. I'll throw one away. ﻿Can I have two shelves? ﻿How many closets do you need? ﻿How many can I have? ﻿No, that's not how it works. ﻿This is antique glass. All wavy and stuff. ﻿No, don't do that. Not like that. No! ﻿Lift this catch here. ﻿I'm terrified it'll break. I gaze out this window. ﻿- No way! - I'm not kidding. ﻿Hey, that's how relationships work. ﻿She's a bit frosty towards me. That's new. ﻿Yeah? Why do you think that is? It's embarrassing to say. We've been single together. ﻿Lived that life. ﻿Then suddenly I move in with you. ﻿- And you're happy? - Yeah. ﻿No, no, no... ﻿Did you date this guy? Yeah, just a fling. Okay. ﻿Stop! ﻿You re so predictable! ﻿Let's just fuck. ﻿Hello! Chapter 1 THE OTHERS ﻿- Happy to see you! - Me too. ﻿- Doing good? - Yeah. ﻿Hi, Martin. ﻿Welcome. ﻿Thanks for coming. ﻿Dad designed it. ﻿We should renovate, but don't want to change anything. It's beautiful. ﻿Yeah, but there's stuff like that. Damp. ﻿We get this room because we're childless. ﻿Dibs on the top bunk. ﻿I always feel that tone doesn't like me. ﻿She's just shy. ﻿That's what you say about boring people. ﻿- It's my turn now - Okay. AD ﻿Thank you. Vin? Vin da blunc? ﻿Thanks. ﻿Do you have any friends with kids yet? ﻿No. Only one. ﻿I guess this feels unfamiliar. ﻿- They're very sweet. - Thanks. ﻿So what are you doing now, Julie? ﻿Aksel says you've started writing? ﻿Well, I wouldn't exactly call it writing. ﻿Being modest? ﻿No. ﻿Seems so. ﻿ls there anything you'd like to do, ﻿as a career? ﻿Questions, questions, Karianne. ﻿That question was vulgar when we were students. Lucky you! ﻿Yeah, we were. ﻿True, we had a lot of freedom. ﻿Being young today is different. ﻿The pressure is heart-breaking. ﻿There's no time to think. ﻿Always something on the screen. ﻿Take William. If we don't set limits, he spends his life on screens. ﻿Nice try. ﻿Okay. ﻿No, it's not your turn. It's Martin's turn. ﻿Julie's still the closest. ﻿Bedtime. ﻿- She's exhausted. - No! ﻿No! ﻿- Yes! - No! ﻿I don't want to go to bed! ﻿I don't want to! ﻿Eva, don't make another scene. Come here! ﻿No! I don't want to! ﻿Let go! ﻿- You silly girl! - I don't want to! ﻿But I want you to! ﻿I don't want to! ﻿Kids can be intense. ﻿Well, it's okay. ﻿- Fun with kids. - Yeah. ﻿Can't we just enjoy it? ﻿Please. No fights. ﻿There are kids here, and it's chaos. ﻿Just try. ﻿Try playing with them or something, okay? ﻿Please. Sp﻿are me the kid talk. Sorry, but I wasn't the one who started. ﻿You're with someone who's younger than you. There's a gap. ﻿You're almost 30. Not a bad age to have kids. I'm 44. I want to go to the next level. With you. It has nothing to do with my friends. You seem to be waiting for something. I don't know what. ﻿Hello? ﻿Jeez. ﻿I didn't want to get into this. Really not.﻿ ﻿Everything's on your terms. ﻿You have time off, so we're on holiday. ﻿You agreed. ﻿After you publish, you get bored. ﻿And start talking about kids. ﻿The others here have kids, so it's an issue. ﻿Not true. It is not true. ﻿And then... ﻿you get a new idea at some point, ﻿and disappear into your drawing board. ﻿What are you saying? ﻿Don't start. It's not cool. ﻿Shut up. Please. ﻿Of course I'd be there if we had kids. ﻿You know that. You know I want children. ﻿Sure, and I'll also want kids at some point. ﻿But I don't know.. I have no maternal instinct, right? No. You'd make a great mom. ﻿I'm sure of it. I want to have children too. ﻿At some point. ﻿So what are we waiting for? What has to happen first? ﻿I don't know what exactly. ﻿I just want to do more first. Okay, like what? What's the obstacle? ﻿I don't know! Why do you ask? Your concept is flawed. ﻿Most people have kids without sorting out their life first. ﻿- They figure it out. - Flawed? ﻿That's how most people do it. ﻿But I don't want everything to happen on your terms. ﻿based on what you want. ﻿Fine. I got it. But what do you want? ﻿Oh, please! We have to stop. ﻿I need sleep to put up with those people. ﻿I know a guy who has a theory about that. He says we have a limited number of sperm. ﻿Say... three trillion in your lifetime. ﻿Jerk off too much ﻿and you run out. Could be true. ﻿Easy now, Portnoy ﻿How fascinating. ﻿Personally, I feel like ﻿I know everything about male problems. ﻿Erectile dysfunction, ﻿morning wood, infatuation with young women... ﻿premature ejaculation... ﻿Nice work, Aksel. It's in all the books and movies. ﻿Where's the menstrual period? ﻿Female orgasm and desire? Where? ﻿Good question. Tell us. In juicy detail. ﻿No, the point is ﻿it shouldn't be taboo. If men had periods, that's all we'd hear about. ﻿Can you womansplain it ﻿a bit better? ﻿What do you mean? ﻿Like mansplaining, but womansplaining. ﻿What? ﻿Mansplaining is... ﻿When a 45-year-old man explains ﻿how things really are to a younger woman. ﻿Nice demonstration! ﻿My pleasure. ﻿Ding! Great! Whiskey, anyone? ﻿How's the senior citizen club doing? Come on. ﻿Look Who's here! ﻿Are you okay? ﻿Not really. ﻿Show me. ﻿No! ﻿Let me see.. ﻿We ll laugh about it later. It's just a scratch. ﻿Karianne's such a drama queen. It's my fault. ﻿Not at all, Julie. Alt is. I always overdo it. ﻿I know being here isn't easy for you. I'm not into this whole "happy family" thing either. ﻿I'm glad it turned into a party tonight. ﻿I hope you had fun! ﻿What the hell's wrong with you? ﻿What's wrong with having a little fun? ﻿I didn't have any fun! ﻿Sorry that happened. ﻿You don't care! ﻿Shut up! Just shut up! ﻿You don't give a shit about me! ﻿Shall we make a baby? ﻿Fuck you. - Hi. ﻿- Good morning. ﻿There's coffee. And cups. ﻿Chapter 2 CHEATING ﻿Sorry, I forgot. ﻿What's your line of work? ﻿I work in a bookstore. ﻿Which one? ﻿Norli, by the university. ﻿Could you excuse me for a moment? ﻿Could you sign? ﻿Sure, I'll just finish this. ﻿Any new Bobcat in the pipeline? ﻿I've moved on. ﻿Do you work full-time there, ﻿or are you just temping on weekends? - Sorry - Bye. Hey, I think I'll head home. ﻿Okay. ﻿- You good? - Yeah. - Sure? - Yeah, I'm fine. - I can stay if you like. - It's okay. - But I have to stay a bit longer. - Of course. ﻿Okay. See you at home. ﻿Hi. Can I have a smoke? ﻿Of course. ﻿I had my second child ten years later. ﻿Now we're supposed to introduce solids at 4 months. ﻿What made the pediatricians change their minds? ﻿- Do you cuddle your kids? - Sure, a lot. ﻿They'll be drug addicts. They'll be addicts because I cuddle them'? ﻿Yeah, according to new research. ﻿New research says you shouldn't cuddle your kids? ﻿I realise it must be counterintuitive for a mother. ﻿But motherhood upsets your limbic system. ﻿So my kids are going to be drug addicts? ﻿That's ridiculous. Do you have children? ﻿No, but I'm a doctor. I have a medical perspective. ﻿Babies express themselves by crying. It's normal for a mother or a father to comfort them. Not asking me the usual questions? ﻿- Which ones? - Who I am, what I do. ﻿Who are you? What do you do? ﻿I hate those questions. ﻿They're especially bad when you're a doctor. ﻿Are you a doctor? ﻿No, you are. Which questions should I ask? ﻿Ask me who I know here. ﻿- Who do you know here? - Nobody. ﻿I crashed the party. ﻿You just waltzed in? ﻿Okay. ﻿Nothing's gonna happen. ﻿Of course not. ﻿I'm with someone I love. ﻿Me too. ﻿And I can't stand cheating. I've been there. Never again. ﻿- Right, cheating is... - No good. ﻿But where do you draw the line? ﻿You can feel it. If I do this... ﻿ls that cheating? ﻿No. ﻿What about this? ﻿- No, that's permissible. - Is it? ﻿And hurting someone who's not your partner? ﻿- You hurt your partner? - Is that cheating? ﻿Did that hurt? ﻿Did it? ﻿- Feel good? - Yeah, it did. ﻿Okay. ﻿Let me smell your sweat. ﻿- No. - Yes. ﻿- Seriously? - Yes, that's allowed. ﻿- It stinks! - Yes. ﻿The kind of smell you never forget. ﻿My turn to smell you. ﻿No, please. I regret it now. ﻿Let me smell. ﻿I think you smell nice. ﻿I don't know if... ﻿this is permissible. ﻿Go ahead. ﻿Okay. ﻿You start, then I'll go next. I ﻿actually think sex is best ﻿when the dick isn't too hard. ﻿Because... ﻿in a way, then I'm the one ﻿who makes it hard, you know? ﻿My secret will be dumb now. ﻿guess I misunderstood. ﻿I was going to say I like the Barcode Project. It looks pretty from the bridge when I go to work. ﻿I expose my darkest secrets, and you... ﻿You said "secrets ", not "darkest". ﻿So why is that a secret? ﻿Because everyone thinks it's ugly. Sorry, we're... ﻿- Can I whisper it? - Okay. ﻿What? ﻿Sorry, I seem to be sitting on everything. ﻿My bad. ﻿There's nothing sexual about that. ﻿Not at all. ﻿Although you do like soft dicks. ﻿Yeah. ﻿Okay. Your turn. ﻿I can't pee. ﻿Just relax. ﻿I'm going this way. ﻿Okay. ﻿What's your name? ﻿Julie. ﻿- I'm Eivind. Eivind... - Don't say it. ﻿Why not? I'll find you on Facebook, and... ﻿Good thinking. ﻿Okay. ﻿- Bye. - Bye. ﻿- We didn't cheat. - No. ﻿- Not at all - No. ﻿Bye. ﻿Chapter 3 ORAL SEX IN THE AGE OF #METOO ﻿Aksel? ﻿Aksel, I need to tell you something. ﻿Aksel? ﻿"A friend told me she had sex with a man who pumped his dick into her mouth while he held her head. She was confused because she enjoyed it. It really turned her on. Can you be a feminist and still enjoy being mouth-fucked? Most women I know are ambivalent about performing oral sex. They must act as if they like... the pathetic expectation ﻿that it'll turn them on.. I like it flaccid. So I create the stiffness instead of having it thrust upon me." ﻿This is good. ﻿-Yeah? - It's over the top. ﻿I don't agree with everything, but it's very well written. ﻿Original. Very good. ﻿What will you do with it? ﻿I don't know. ﻿You really think it's good? ﻿Yeah. Absolutely. ﻿You sure? ﻿Yeah, I'm not lying. ﻿No? ﻿Are you sure? Don't you dare doubt it. It's pretty cerebral. ﻿But it turns me on too. - Right? - Kinda. Is that why you wrote it? Intellectual Viagra? ﻿- Yeah. - It works. ﻿Her piece "Oral Sex in the Age of #MeToo" It was widely shared and set off a lively Facebook debate. ﻿With the strong painkillers I'm on, I can't drive. Chapter 4 OUR OWN FAMILY ﻿I hoped I could come, but... ﻿I can't spend an hour on a bus with this back. Don't worry about it. ﻿Could you come to Hønefoss next weekend? ﻿So we can celebrate together. ﻿Nathalie says happy birthday too. ﻿Say hello from me. ﻿How nice to see you. ﻿- It's been too long. - Way too long. ﻿Anyway, have a nice birthday. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Okay. ﻿I'm too skinny? ﻿- You work too much. - True. We'll talk later. ﻿Happy birthday! ﻿- Why do I always have to go see him? - He's not coming? ﻿Well, he's got a backache. There's always something wrong with him. ﻿Hello! ﻿So he's not coming. ﻿That's not nice. ﻿He wanted to, but he has a backache. ﻿Does he realise how it makes you feel? ﻿- He's... - It's a backache, Mom. ﻿Sorry. Please help yourself. ﻿Thank you. It looks delicious. ﻿I hope you like it. ﻿Hurray and happy birthday today! It's time to celebrate you! ﻿At 30, Julie's mom, Eva, ﻿had been divorced for two years. A single mom ﻿and accountant in a publishing house. ﻿Let us dance, hop, jump and turn ﻿Wishing you the very happiest returns For ﻿now it's time for celebration! ﻿Congratulation! ﻿Thanks. ﻿Have you read Julie's article? ﻿Of course. ﻿- And? - It's great. ﻿Have. You read it, Mom? ﻿No. ﻿Julie's article. It's excellent. ﻿At 30, Julie's grandmother had three children. ﻿She played Rebecca West in Rosmersholm at the National Theater. ﻿At 30, Julie's great-grandmother, Astrid, ﻿was a widow, alone with four children. ﻿Julie's great-great-grandmother had seven children. ﻿Two died of tuberculosis. ﻿Julie's great-great-great-grandmother, Herta, was a merchant's wife ﻿with six children ﻿in a loveless marriage. ﻿Julie's great-great-great-great grandmother never turned 30. ﻿The life expectancy for women at the time was 35 years. ﻿I don't want to bother you with it, but... It's getting harder and harder to pee. ﻿I was scared it was prostate cancer, ﻿but it wasn't. ﻿- Well, that's good. - Yeah. ﻿Still... ﻿I go to the toilet all the time. And. ﻿there's leakage. ﻿Thanks for the cool jacket. Good timing. ﻿I want to get into hiking. ﻿Sorry we're late. ﻿You didn't make them coffee? It's okay. ﻿I'll fix something. ﻿- How'd it go? - Great. ﻿- How many saves? - Lots. ﻿Good job. ﻿Happy belated birthday. ﻿30 is pretty major ﻿Too bad we missed it. ﻿The tournament lasted all day. ﻿So we couldn't come. ﻿No problem. That's okay. ﻿She's the goalkeeper. You should see her play. No, she doesn't have to. ﻿She's awesome. ﻿I'll let you know next time. ﻿Yeah, please do. ﻿Cool. ﻿Did you get the article I sent you? ﻿Yeah I was about to ask you. I couldn't get the link to work. ﻿My PC acts up. ﻿Know anything about computers? ﻿can take a look. ﻿But can't she just resend the email? ﻿Wasn't there a... ﻿Did she send it in an email? ﻿An attachment to an email. ﻿No, I pressed the button on the mouse. ﻿Then I put the arrow on the square. ﻿I tried twice, then it vanished. It could be my fault. ﻿Maybe I sent the wrong version. ﻿We'll fix it. You have to read that article. It's really good. ﻿Very... ﻿Very well written, and... ﻿Clever girl. ﻿When are you coming to see us. Per Harald? ﻿We'd love it. Come see where your daughter lives. ﻿Sure, of course. ﻿But it's hard to park in Central Oslo. ﻿They've got that... ﻿resident... ﻿resident parking there. ﻿Yeah. It's made it much easier to find a space. ﻿You just have to pay. ﻿And move the car every half hour? ﻿ls that the reason you don't come to see us? ﻿Because it's hard to drive in town? ﻿That's not it. ﻿Then what is it? ﻿Well, you know... ﻿with my painkillers, I'm not allowed to drive. ﻿There's that too. ﻿The good thing is he's open about it. ﻿His pains. His prostate. ﻿You have to make your own family. ﻿Chapter 5 BADTIMING ﻿Excuse me? Do you have Green Yoga? ﻿Let me check. - Which book again? - Green Yoga. ﻿Published last year. ﻿No, I'll have to order it. It's not in stock. ﻿How long will it take? ﻿Two weeks. ﻿Okay. No thanks. ﻿They don't have it either. ﻿Okay. ﻿We can try at Ark. ﻿Thank you. ﻿I told her I forgot my sunglasses. I ﻿just had to say ﻿that I know what we said. ﻿But I think about you a lot. And... ﻿I don't want to bug you if you're happy. ﻿Are you? ﻿- I don't know what to say. - Say nothing. I'﻿d like to see you again. Just to talk. I mean, I'm not going to... But I'd like to see you again. Just to... ﻿I'm at Apent Bakeri in Barcodes nearly every day. ﻿I work there, I mean. If you want to. So..﻿ - Eivind? - Yes. ﻿Your glasses. ﻿Oh, right. Fuck. ﻿Language opens the door to the subconscious. ﻿Freud was a great writer. ﻿He could be self-critical. ﻿He never hesitated to revise his theories. ﻿He viewed each individual patient as a research subject. ﻿Freud didn't distinguish between therapy and research. ﻿I find that very compelling. ﻿Especially these days, ﻿when scientific methodology is applied ﻿even in the humanities. ﻿Enough about Freud. How's the movie coming along? Isn't it almost done? ﻿Yeah, I've seen it, but... ﻿- You have? - Yes. It's no longer mine at all. Is it as bad as you feared? ﻿The worst thing is how they've housetrained Bobcat. It's all very sanitised and safe. ﻿I'll show you something. A ﻿mock-up of the movie poster. ﻿I have to admit... I'﻿m embarrassed my name's on it. ﻿Shit. ﻿No! Seriously? ﻿You must be kidding. No way. ﻿That's the poster. For real. ﻿Let's see. ﻿Looks like Chip and Dale. ﻿Holy shit. ﻿Should I laugh or cry? ﻿Everything was butchered. The story. All the details. ﻿They removed the starfish. ﻿Sorry, I'm lost. ﻿What starfish? It's, you know... ﻿the butthole. The anus. ﻿His butt is smooth in the movie. ﻿This thing is gone. ﻿That's bad in my book. In underground comics you shit, ﻿you puke, you fuck and all that stuff. ﻿Bobcat is a wild cat in a world of domestic cats. He's a rebel against the bourgeoisie. ﻿One of the most iconic buttholes ever. ﻿Coffee? ﻿Yeah. ﻿I don't know what we should do. ﻿I have to go. ﻿Aksel, ﻿we need to talk. ﻿Yeah, of course. ﻿What's wrong ﻿Julie said she'd been thinking. It wasn't his fault. Nothing he could have changed. It's not anything you've done. It's not your fault. But I feel... It was about all their old arguments. ﻿Things they both knew. It was bad timing. ﻿They'd met in different phases of life. ﻿They wanted different things. ﻿We want different things. ﻿Are you leaving me? ﻿Yeah. ﻿I want it to be over. ﻿Are you sure you're yourself right now? ﻿What do you mean? ﻿Do you realise... ﻿Do you realise what you're doing? ﻿What you're destroying? ﻿Yes, of course. That's why it's so hard ﻿Where will you live? ﻿I don't know. ﻿You don't know? ﻿No. With Mom. ﻿Move home to Mom? ﻿Yeah. Until I find a place. Okay. ﻿No, come on.. It's over. ﻿I've had it. What else can I say? Is something else bothering you and you're venting on me? ﻿No. ﻿I've thought about it for a long time. It feels right. ﻿Have you met someone? ﻿No. ﻿I'm so sick of all this, Julie. Dammit. ﻿Sick to death of it. ﻿But okay. ﻿Just leave. If that's what you want. ﻿I'll take a walk while you pack. Julie said he deserved a more grounded woman. ﻿Ready for children. ﻿Who was dependable, ﻿didn't flake out every six months. ﻿But I like you flaky. ﻿Aksel said he liked her flaky. ﻿That he needed someone like that. ﻿Who could draw him out of his drawing board. ﻿And as for having kids... ﻿He said he'd rather be childless with her ﻿than have kids with anyone else. ﻿You know that's not the only problem. ﻿So what is the problem? ﻿It's a combination of things, not just that. ﻿I can see you're in a crisis right now. ﻿I can understand that. ﻿But if you love me, we'll sort it all out. ﻿Yes, I do love you. And I don't love you. ﻿Julie felt that this sentence, ﻿the way she said it, ﻿her emphasis on certain words, ﻿summed up the impossibility of it all. I feel like a spectator in my own life. ﻿Like I'm playing a supporting role in my own life. ﻿I get that you feel stuck. ﻿You need a change. ﻿But is this the solution? This is exactly my point. ﻿I'm trying to tell you how I feel, ﻿and you're defining my feelings. ﻿see what you're doing. ﻿What am I doing? Tell me what I'm doing. ﻿Shut up, and I'll tell you. ﻿You're acting out the confrontation you never dared have with your father. ﻿-You're taking it out on me. - Is that so? ﻿What do you know about it? ﻿This is the crux of our relationship. ﻿Everything we feel, we have to put into words. ﻿Sometimes, I just want to feel things. ﻿You insist on being so damn strong all the time. ﻿For you, ﻿being strong ﻿is about formulating things. ﻿If you analyse things ﻿at every psychological level, ﻿you think you're strong. ﻿Because I'm less analytical, you think I'm weaker. She said she was terrified of being alone. ﻿Terrified of living without him. That when she left, ﻿she'd be like Bambi on the ice. ﻿And that was precisely why she had to do it. ﻿Aksel mumbled soothing words she didn't hear. ﻿She was thinking about how, at the age of 30, she'd just compared herself to Bambi. ﻿No. ﻿I'm pathetic. ﻿No, you're not. A bit? ﻿Aksel... ﻿Hey. ﻿I didn't mean what I said. It's okay. ﻿said plenty of things too. ﻿Stay a little longer. ﻿You'll regret it. I'm sure I will. ﻿The saddest thing, ﻿is one day, you'll want kids. In any case, you'll have other relationships. ﻿And you'll realise that what we had was unique ﻿I know. ﻿You don't. But I do. I've had many relationships. ﻿I know how hard it is. ﻿Nobody communicates like we do. Laughs like we do. ﻿Who knows? Maybe we'll get back together someday. ﻿Then and there, ﻿she meant it. ﻿I mean it. AD﻿ ﻿Chapter 6 FINNMARK HIGHLANDS ﻿- Are you cold? - Yeah. ﻿- It looked easier on YouTube. - I told you we should practice. ﻿Wait... ﻿This one first ﻿- Are you sure? - Yes, this goes on top. ﻿Right, but is it first? Isn't the other one first? ﻿- No, that's the top. - Okay. ﻿Eivind turned it into a funny story he told everyone. ﻿But it touched something deeper in her. ﻿Awoke something in her. She googled her family name. ﻿Her grandfather came from the Far North. ﻿The DNA sample she sent to America confirmed it. ﻿Eivind didn't see how her newfound identity as 3.1% Sami ﻿connected to mind-expanding substances and unrelated exotic rituals, ﻿but tried to be supportive. ﻿As she became increasingly militant, ﻿she saw how climate change was hurting indigenous people. Inuit starving as seals vanish. ﻿Melting ice ruining reindeer pastures. ﻿Aborigines dying of skin cancer from the hole in the ozone. ﻿Eivind could forget about flying to New York. ﻿Breathe in. All the way up. ﻿She made them live ﻿more sustainably. ﻿He could always do better. ﻿Study the ingredients more closely. ﻿Consider the environmental impact of his purchases. ﻿Plastic is killing the oceans. ﻿Norwegian cod was ferried to China and back. ﻿Cobalt mining was destroying the Congo. ﻿Batteries had blood on their hands. ﻿The sum of Western guilt sat beside, him on the couch. Went ﻿to bed with him at night. ﻿Everything was weighed against the greater cause. ﻿He felt he was betraying Sunniva. Betraying the Sami people. ﻿Felt like the world's worst person, but couldn't resist. ﻿I forgot my sunglasses inside. Right. ﻿Be right back. Chapter 7 A NEW CHAPTER ﻿Eivind didn't want kids either. ﻿Climate researchers foresaw hard times for future generations. ﻿Overpopulation was the reason everything was falling apart. ﻿Julie liked how this pessimism added depth ﻿to his cheerful nature. ﻿But she could tell he had other reasons too. ﻿Eivind's father, like Julie's, ﻿tended to forget birthdays. ﻿Eivind would often say, "According to my father's calendar..." I'm 12 years old. They're all hard. No ripe ones. People die of thirst in Chile. ﻿because avocados need so much water. ﻿Still following Sunniva on Instagram? ﻿Yeah, she posts interesting links about the environment. ﻿We don't message or anything. ﻿She's got over 30,000 followers. ﻿For showing off her ass? She's ﻿not showing off her ass, she's doing yoga. It's yoga. ﻿Okay, she shows it off a bit. ﻿I don't mind you following her. It's not a problem, but... ﻿I don't want to be ﻿the sensible choice while she's the sexy one. ﻿There's nothing sensible about you. ﻿- I Mean... - Yeah. ﻿- The angle of her pelvis... - It's yoga. ﻿That's not yoga. It ﻿is yoga. ﻿You liked it! ﻿Oh, my god! ﻿- That's not cool! - I had to like it! ﻿That's right. ﻿So, that's why... ﻿Chapter 8 JULIE'S NARCISSISTIC CIRCUS I ﻿want people to watch me dance. It's annoying as hell. ﻿You can make a fool of yourself on the dance floor and still be cool. ﻿So true! I've noticed that. When we dance, ﻿you take up all the space. ﻿Yeah, but it's also like, "Everyone look at me!" ﻿Yeah, that's my point. You're always so mysterious. ﻿You still have your stash? What's that? ﻿Where'd you find it? ﻿What is it? ﻿Magic mushrooms. ﻿Have you tried it? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Right. ﻿Why'd you do that? ﻿Yuck. ﻿Tastes like dirt. ﻿Anyone? ﻿I don't feel anything. They're probably too old. ﻿I gotta go. ﻿Are you sure? Could be risky. ﻿Come on, man. ﻿We've done this before. ﻿- We ll talk tomorrow. - Call me. ﻿Adil? ﻿Can you speak? It's kicking in for him. ﻿Julie? Is it starting to kick in? ﻿You need water. It's important. ﻿You have to drink lots of water. ﻿Here. ﻿Drink it all. ﻿You'll be okay. ﻿You know I'm here for you. ﻿Julie? Drink the water. It's okay! I'm here! ﻿Julie, are you okay? ﻿I thought I'd make it. ﻿Are you okay? ﻿Thought we could use some coffee. ﻿We won't be doing that again. ﻿You should take a shower. Do I smell bad? ﻿- Is that... - Oh my god. Oh, my god. I need to take a shower. ﻿Don't worry, it's not urgent. ﻿Shall I make breakfast? I feel I can be myself with you. ﻿Completely. You weren't yourself before? I was, but I felt like I had to be a bit... Like I was when we first met. Thanks for putting up with me. ﻿I love you. Chapter 9 BOBCAT WRECKS XMAS ﻿Bobcat Wrecks Xmas ﻿Have you read your old Bobcat comics since you grew up? ﻿Because in our day and age, ﻿they seem so inappropriate and murky ﻿that we feel almost sick ﻿reading them. It's unpleasant to realize you created a character ﻿who gained popularity at the expense of women. ﻿Okay, I get it. ﻿You're saying art should be pleasant? Do you think it's art? ﻿I brought along some of your early comics. ﻿Bobcat is one thing, but then there's Dick Wolf Dick, ﻿Pedo the Parrot.. ﻿Right, I don't really think this is the right medium to ﻿explain comic book humour. ﻿Have you ever considered that some of your readers ﻿may have been victims of incest or rape? ﻿Jeez. ﻿Do we stop creating because some people might feel bad? ﻿Artists get killed for drawing things others find offensive. They're shot. ﻿Are you comparing Mohammed caricatures ﻿with drawings of women with big tits? ﻿Or with incest? ﻿What's your point? ﻿Well, yes and no. It's a bit of a cop-out ﻿to claim freedom of speech when people criticise you. ﻿We're discussing your work right now, ﻿so nobody's censoring you. ﻿As a woman, I'm upset. ﻿I'm offended, though we're not supposed to say that. ﻿You have a choice. You don't have to feel offernded. It's not a choice. ﻿This is very generational. ﻿One author cannot be held solely responsible. I think art has to be messy and free. It has to be a bit dangerous to be fun. ﻿I want art to be a form of therapy ﻿where I can express and work through ﻿all my unacceptable thoughts, ﻿all my darkest impulses. ﻿But you're using your male privilege ﻿to mock people weaker than you. It's hardly art or even humour. ﻿Sorry, it's not smart enough to be satire. ﻿But this isn't about me. ﻿Like, when I create something, ﻿it's not just me talking. ﻿- I know that much. - Do you? Let's say I draw this interview as a cartoon. ﻿The comic version of me might call you a whore. It doesn't mean I think that. It could be ﻿a parody of a certain type of insecure male... ﻿You used the word "whore"? ﻿Yes, I said "whore". You're not interested in what I mean. ﻿Can't you see that's crass sexualisation? ﻿I think we're on a slippery slope here. ﻿All you post-feminists are so fucking self-righteous! ﻿Thank you, Marthe Refstad and Aksel Willmann. ﻿The term is sex worker now, by the way. Chapter 10 FIRST PERSON SINGULAR I'm happy to help! ﻿Long time no see! ﻿-Yeah. - How are you? ﻿Okay. And you? I'm good. ﻿Do you ever talk to Aksel? Is he okay? ﻿Yeah, well.. ﻿I heard the radio interview. ﻿Yeah. ﻿He went a bit far. ﻿He's not doing that well. ﻿Did you know he's sick? ﻿Aksel? ﻿Haven't you heard? ﻿He has cancer. ﻿Sorry, I thought you know. It spread quickly. ﻿They discovered it too late. ﻿Cancer? ﻿Pancreatic. ﻿But... ﻿How is he coping? ﻿Pretty well, under the circumstances. ﻿But its hard. ﻿The prognosis ﻿is not good. It's incurable. ﻿Thanks for letting me know. ﻿I thought you knew. ﻿No, I hadn't heard anything. It's just... ﻿I didn't know. ﻿When did you write this? ﻿Have you read it? I ﻿was moving it to paper recycling. It's very good. You think?﻿ ﻿Yeah, it sucked me right in. It's really, really great. ﻿I mean.. It's like... ﻿What? ﻿Well.. ﻿I have to say, ﻿it's really nice to read about you. ﻿But it's not about me. ﻿But the Christmas scene is your family, right? ﻿Yeah, but it's fiction. You didn't get that? I made it up. ﻿Okay, it's fiction. In any case... ﻿- it's good. - Because it's me? ﻿No, because it's nice. "'Nice"? ﻿Yeah, nice. Good. Well written. ﻿The way you write is really great. Like here:﻿ "Too many memories overlapping, blending into a blur." ﻿That resonates with me. It's well written Truly good. It's not well written. ﻿What's wrong? ﻿Suddenly you're into literature? ﻿What was the last book you read? - Are you okay? What's up? - Why? ﻿You criticise everything I do these days. ﻿Sorry, but going through my trash is pretty invasive. ﻿- Can't you see that? - Relax. ﻿- "Relax?" - Calm down. ﻿Relaxing is your specialty! You don't mind serving coffee till you're 50. ﻿But I want more! That's hurtful. I don't know what to say. Chapter 11 POSITIVE ﻿Hello? ﻿Hey... ﻿Have you eaten? ﻿Yeah, but I can make pasta if you like. ﻿No, I don't need any if you've eaten. ﻿Oops, sorry. It started with a backache. ﻿I've had backaches before. I didn't worry. ﻿Then my skin turned almost golden. ﻿I thought I looked good. It turned out to be jaundice. ﻿Mom said I was born jaundiced. They put me in a light box. Is it painful? ﻿No, not really. It's okay. ﻿They block selected neural pathways with Botox. ﻿That's good. ﻿Yeah, it keeps me from taking too many painkillers. ﻿How's your family doing? ﻿Fine, I guess. ﻿Mom still follows your every move. ﻿And your dad? ﻿I've basically cut him off. ﻿Good. ﻿He can chase me if he likes. ﻿Does he? ﻿No, not really. ﻿Two coffees. ﻿They thought it was hilarious. In some circumstances, ﻿morbid humour can be funny. ﻿Even anal sex at a bar mitzvah? It makes me laugh. But I'm an old guy now. ﻿No. ﻿Well, you know... ﻿I kind of expected this. I'd given up long before I got sick. Really. I just watch my favourite old movies over and over. ﻿Lynch, The Godfather Part II.. ﻿How many times can you watch ﻿Dog Day Afternoon? ﻿Many times! ﻿You should. ﻿Absolutely. Sometimes I listen to music. ﻿I haven't heard before. ﻿But... It's old as well. ﻿Music I didn't know about, but from when I grew up. It felt as though I'd already given up. ﻿I grew up in an age without Internet and mobile phones. No, but honestly... I sound like an old fart. But I think about it a lot. ﻿The world that I knew... ﻿has disappeared. ﻿For me it was all about going to stores. ﻿Record stores. I'd take the tram to Voices in Grünerløkka. Leaf ﻿through used comics at Pretty Price. ﻿I can close my eyes and see the aisles at Video Nova in Majorstua. ﻿I grew up in a time ﻿when culture was passed along through objects. ﻿They were interesting because ﻿we could live among them. ﻿We could pick them up. Hold them in our hands. ﻿Compare them. ﻿A bit like books? ﻿Yeah, a bit like books. ﻿That's all I have. I spent my life doing that. ﻿Collecting all that stuff, comics, books... ﻿And.. ﻿I just continued, even when it stopped giving me ﻿the powerful emotions I felt in my early 20s. I continued anyway. ﻿And.. ﻿now it's all I have left. ﻿Knowledge and memories of stupid, futile things ﻿nobody cares about. ﻿Don't say that. ﻿You've got the comics you created. ﻿I wish I'd had what you had. ﻿To be able to draw ﻿without doubting that you're doing what you're supposed to do. I ﻿really wish I had that. ﻿Yeah, but... I'﻿ve got cancer. I'm dying. ﻿Of course I'm being retrospective. ﻿You said you've done that for ages. ﻿Not for that long. In recent years. I reached a point in life when suddenly... It just happened. ﻿When... I began to worship what had been. ﻿And now I have nothing else. I have no future. I can only look back. ﻿And It's not even nostalgia. It's.. ﻿Fear of death. It's because I'm scared. It has nothing to do with art. ﻿I'm just trying to process... I have surgery tomorrow at 9. ﻿I felt I could tell you anything. You wouldn't judge me. ﻿You're the least judgmental person I know. ﻿I don't have anyone I can talk to... ﻿the way we used to talk. ﻿Can you tell me what you used to tell me? ﻿I hated hearing it at the time, but can you tell me... I'll be a good mother? Are you pregnant? Congratulations? ﻿How do you feel? Good or bad? I don't know. I'm not sure. It was an accident. I must've been careless. I mean, clearly I was. ﻿Were you really sure? Sure you wanted kids? ﻿I was scared too. I had doubts, of course. But I didn't want to show them, to keep you from... ﻿I never doubted you'd make a good mother. I ﻿saw that you doubted it. If I regret one thing, it's that I never managed to make you see how wonderful you are. ﻿What are you thinking? ﻿This is hard to hear. ﻿But... will you keep it? ﻿I don't know. ﻿I wasted so much time ﻿worrying about what could go wrong. ﻿But what did go wrong, was never the things I worried about. If he's a kind man, then go for it. ﻿With a kind father, and you as the mother, ﻿everything will be fine. ﻿Your voice has stayed in my head. ﻿We still have, great conversations. ﻿No way? ﻿About what? ﻿Mostly about comics. ﻿Eclectic tastes. ﻿Same here. ﻿I have imaginary conversations with you. ﻿I'm sure I remember things about you that you've, forgotten. ﻿And the other way round. ﻿Yeah, maybe. ﻿When I'm gone, ﻿all that stuff about you will go with me. May I ask you a question? ﻿Had you already met him when you broke up with me? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Why didn't you tell me? ﻿I don't know. ﻿I didn't dare. ﻿And now you're breaking up with him? ﻿No, why do you say that? ﻿Maybe because you don't seem happy about the baby. ﻿And that's what you do when things get tough. ﻿I'm glad I'm pregnant. I'm sorry. It's alright. ﻿You were the most important relationship in my life. ﻿You don't have to say anything. ﻿I know it's not the same for you. That's normal. You have many years left to live. ﻿But I know, I feel it. ﻿And I want you to know. ﻿You were the love of my life. You're a damn good person. ﻿I should've told you before. ﻿But I couldn't. I'﻿m pregnant. ﻿How long have you known? ﻿I know we don't want kids. ﻿No... ﻿I don't know if I do. ﻿I feel like I never see anything through. I go from one thing to another. ﻿I need time ﻿to think about all this. ﻿About us. It's okay. Chapter 12 EVERYTHING COMES TO AN END ﻿That's where I lived. ﻿We moved there when I was 8. ﻿Shall we knock? ﻿No. I don't think so. ﻿What do you remember from here? I ﻿remember these colours. ﻿They were always my reference ﻿when I drew my comics. ﻿These colours. ﻿And I remember ﻿the local drunk, who was super nice. I'm so tried fro pretending everything is okay. It sucks being in so much pain. It sucks. ﻿Everything sucks. ﻿And.. ﻿I don't want to be a memory for you. ﻿I don't want to be a voice in your head. ﻿I don't want to live on through my art. I want to live in my flat. ﻿I want to live... ﻿I want to live in my flat with you. ﻿I want to be happy together. ﻿Bye. ﻿Bye. ﻿Hi, Julie. ﻿Aksel's condition has suddenly worsened. ﻿He's too ill for his planned treatment. ﻿He may not make it through the night. ﻿His family is with him, but I thought you should know. ﻿EPILOGUE ﻿There's nothing more to say. ﻿Cut! ﻿One more. ﻿One more quick take. Slight adjustment. ﻿Be sadder. ﻿Okay. ﻿But he gets up so quickly. ﻿Hey! OK, camera ready. ﻿Action! ﻿There's nothing more to say. ﻿Cut! Great. ﻿Let's move on. ﻿Right, stills. Sorry, I need some shots of you. Act like you're looking at him. By: Nizar Ezzeddine
