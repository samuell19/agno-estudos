Ladies and gentlemen, clap your hands together for my daddy, Na'im Lynn. Yeah. Keep it goin', y'all. Clap it up. Yeah! Happy as hell to be here, man. Yeah. Man, doin' a show in front of real people. Hmm? Been doin' a lot of Zoom comedy shows during quarantine. Bombin' like a motherfucker too. Bombed so bad the last one, I had to send the cash back. I said, "Hey, man, just take this $50. Don't tell nobody about this shit." Was bored as hell during quarantine. Who else was bored? Clap your hands. - Wastin' money. Online shopping. I was buying bullshit on Amazon. They got all my fuckin' money, man. I bought a fuckin' sauna on Amazon. A one-person sauna. That bitch was a bag with a zipper on it. You zip that bitch to your neck and plug it in. Just start sweatin'. Got my 23andMe test done. Mmm-hmm. Got my results back. Found out I'm Black. Ain't that some bullshit? I spent $100 to find out I'm Black. Got the result. That shit says, "77% African, 13% European…" There was miscellaneous shit, I was like, "That's some slave shit right there." I'll tell you what wasn't in it. No Indian in that motherfucker. Black people, our grandparents told us that we got Indian in our fuckin' family, right? Bullshit. When the fuck was niggas and natives hangin' out? How? How the fuck we got Indian in our family? My shit had zero Native American. I called my grandmother immediately. I said, "You a lying motherfucker." We ain't got no damn Indian in our family. My aunt… I got an aunt, she kind of big, right? She's like, "I'm not doing that test. You're not worried they'll have your DNA?" I said, "I don't give a fuck." She's like, "Not doing it 'cause I don't want nobody to clone me." I said, "Yeah… ain't nobody cloning fat bitches, Aunty." I said, "Till they need more people to make potato salad around here, I think you're good." Motherfuckers dying left and right. Oh, my God. Not 'cause of COVID. I'm talking about celebrities, right? Every week, there's a new celebrity done died. This shit is crazy. I hate that saying, "Death come in threes." That's some bullshit. A million people die every day. Death don't come in threes. It comes in a million. My boy is like, "Man, people dying. You know death come in threes." I said, "Who died?" He said, "Shit, Hank Aaron, Larry King…" I said, "Who the third person?" He said, "My uncle." "Nah…" "That ain't how that work, man." I was surprised as hell when Larry King died. 'Cause I thought he already was dead. I was like… "Larry King is still alive?" Got a new president. Mmm-hmm. Anybody voted for Donald Trump? Nah… Uh, there's some white motherfucker in the back, like… "I didn't come here for this." "Do your goddamn show." Joe Biden in office now. Oh, my God. I don't know about him either. Joe Biden was a safe bet though, right? That motherfucker 80. He only doin' one term. No way he gonna make it to a second term. He gonna clock out one way or another after his first term. Somethin' creepy about Joe Biden, isn't it? Motherfucker's eyes always be real tight and shit. Walk around like he didn't pay for some pussy before, don't he? "Come get this $40." When are we gonna get a female president? - That's what I want. Y'all want one? That damn Hillary. She know how to lose, don't she? Goddamn. Shit. Who are we gonna get? Know why I want a female president? 'Cause I want women to get equal pay. It's important to me y'all make the same amount of money as men. Yes. - Mmm-hmm. Y'all can start pickin' up some tabs around here. Drink gettin' hot. I wish Michelle Obama was runnin'. That's my lady there. I love Michelle Obama. - Mmm-hmm. I don't know if she'll do a good job. I just like looking at her. Michelle fine as hell to me. We ain't have no fine First Lady in a long time. We got Jacqueline Onassis. There's a bunch of old, ugly bitches after that. Nobody's shaking for Barbara Bush. Bitch had a grey Afro. I think Barbara Bush was Ronald McDonald. We ain't seen Ronald McDonald in a long time. "Is that Barbara Bush with makeup on?" Then Michelle came through sexy as hell, with her arms out. Tall, dark, beautiful, big ol' ass. Mmm-hmm. Teeth a little sharp. Uh, you know, nobody's perfect. Y'all know Michelle got some sharp-ass teeth. Michelle look like she could fuck a corn on the cob up. "Who ate all the corn?" Sharp teeth are scary, right? Men don't like that shit. We don't like sharp teeth. Hmm. You ever got a sharp-tooth blow job, brother? Nah? You lucky. Consider yourself lucky, man. 'Cause women like giving head these days, but, you know… Stop watching porn, all right? That's the problem. You watch porn and learn tricks. You doin' it wrong. You fuckin' shit up. You're doin' a bad job. Because you're doin' all this extra shit. The pepper grindin' and all this shit. You know what this is? This shit is called the "Indian Burn." You gotta lick the fuck out of your palm before you do that shit. Men don't complain. We gettin' a bad blow job, we won't say shit. We just sit there and power through, right? We know if we complain, y'all gonna get mad. "Fuckin' suck your own dick." "Damn! Why I got to suck my own dick?" "I just want you to loosen your grip." You can tell if a man likes it or not. Look at his face and see which row of teeth are showing. The top row of teeth are showing, that's a smile. Look. If that bottom row of teeth are showing, that's pain. "Come on, Michelle." Y'all got the noise and all the sound effects down. I don't like all that shit. Give me some nice, neat head. Neat. I don't like all that fuckin' gaggin' and all that shit, man. "What the fuck are you doin'? You're killing yourself. Stop." "Your fuckin' nose is runnin'." I don't like that shit. 'Cause when they do that, there's too much spit. I don't like when there's too much spit. "How the fuck did my asshole get wet? This supposed to be a blow job." "You slobbin' everywhere. It's too much spit." After a blow job, you supposed to put it back in your pants and leave. I gotta take a shower after this 'cause I got suds in my ass. Ass all gooey and shit. Where are the classy ladies? Clap your hands if you're classy. Still classy in 2021. That ain't even all you all clappin'. Some of y'all are like, "Fuck that classy shit. I'm a fuckin' rat." "Proud." Back in the day, women had to be classy. Remember? Brother trying to get some, girl's on her period, had something sweet to say. Like, "Hey, girl, I'm tryin' to come over and bake them yams." She be like… "You can't, because my friend's in town." We all stupid. "What the fuck you mean you got a friend in town?" "I'mma catch y'all and fuck both of y'all up." "No, silly goose." Try that shit these days. "Hey, girl, I'm tryin' to come over there and drop it off in them drawers." She be like… "You can't, because it's… shark week, motherfucker." "Shark week?" "Why your voice just changed?" "'Cause that's what happens during shark week." Fellas, did you know that women know exactly what they're lookin' for in a man? They know exactly what they like. Have you ever dealt with a girl who says, "You're not the type of guy I usually go for"? That means she settled for your ugly ass. She ain't want you. She kept tryin' to get what she wanted. It wasn't working. Then one day she was in a bar, and she was sad. Then your ugly ass walked in, and you had a job. She tried something new. Women know what they like. Women like tall, dark, handsome, muscles, big dicks, right? And fuckin' beards. Y'all like beards? - Yeah! - Yes! You like that beard till he goes down on you and that beard eats your asshole alive. You got that Brillo pad scrubbin' through your ass. Motherfucker come up lookin' like a bird shit on his face. Then you don't want to kiss him no more. Mmm… Mmm-mmm. "You gonna kiss me. I'm a kisser." Love to kiss but I don't like morning sex. That shit is out. The breath. If you have morning sex, you can only do one position. You gotta do doggie. Right? You shove her head into that fuckin' pillow so you don't smell that mouth. Mornin' sex… Clap your hands if you like mornin' sex. Round of applause. See? - Fuckin' animals. There's nothing romantic about mornin' sex. Ain't nobody gettin' up, lightin' no fuckin' candles. Ain't no rose petals in place. Morning sex is fuckin' barbaric. Whoever come first, wins. That's what that shit is. Morning sex is just like prison sex. It's the same shit. 'Cause you don't know what's goin' on at first. The woman will be in a deep sleep. You just roll over and… "No!" "Shut up, bitch. You know what time it is." "Morning sex, homie." I don't like shower sex either. I know y'all like, "This motherfucker boring." I don't like shower sex. You can take a shower with somebody and find out they not a good washer. I was in the shower with this girl. I'm doing my thing. I look over. I see her skipping shit. "She gonna get to it in a second." She's like, "You ready to get out?" I said, "No, you ain't done." We take a shower every day, right? Most of us. A couple of us. You got a routine. Do the same shit in the shower every day. I don't give a fuck what it is, last two things you wash gotta be your feet and your ass. If it's not, then you doin' it wrong. You can't go ass to shoulders. You walk around, your shrugs stinkin' all day. "The fuck is that smell?" It's your shitty shoulders. It's feet and ass. What order you do it in, that's your business. Me, I do ass, then feet. I'd rather my feet smell like ass than my ass smell like feet. Can't be out here with athlete's ass. Learned a lot of shit during quarantine. COVID shit, man. I got a question for y'all. First, if you gotta sneeze, and you got your mask on, are you supposed to sneeze in the mask or pull the mask off? Take it off? See? Nobody knows. You said, "Hell no." She said, "Take it off." I fucked around and sneezed in my mask last week. That shit ain't feel right. I said, "I'm about to fuck around and get me sick." "That's some bullshit right here." We learned a new term during quarantine. The term "Karen." Y'all know what a Karen is, right? If you don't know what a "Karen" is, a Karen is a white woman that do not like to see Black people have fun. I seen this video on Instagram, this lady was spazzing out, she was fuckin' this lady's car up. Then it flipped and there was a Black lady holding her by the hair, and threw that bitch in the bushes. And I enjoyed that. I don't know if anybody has ever been thrown in the bushes before, but if you have, you know you can't get out of the bushes by yourself. You gotta roll out that motherfucker. Anybody gain weight, put on a little couple pounds during… Little COVID-15? I lost a little weight. I didn't gain. Thank God. I lost. I gain weight in two places. My gut and my face. What fuckin' exercise do you do for the face? I got a fuckin' Frisbee on my shoulders. It's why I don't like wearin' a mask. I put that shit on like a thong on my face. A little bit of mouth hangin' out on the side. There's a few things that never stop growing on your body. Your nose, your ears, and apparently your fuckin' head. Because, uh, last time I put on a snapback hat, that shit was down to two snaps. I don't know if anybody wore a snapback hat before, but if you have, you know once you get past three snaps, that shit be like this in the back. "Oh, my head big as shit." I exercise and work out, I only do upper body. I don't give a fuck about legs. Fuck that. I ain't out here tryin' to get an ass. Fuck legs. All I care about is looking good in the car. Through the window, oh, this shit is sexy as hell. I got a nice body up here. I got a nice car, so I always try and talk to women when I'm in the car. I was tryin' to talk to this girl, she's like, "Uh-uh, you got to get out if you want to talk to me." I jumped out. She's like, Ew, what happened to your legs?" I said, "Nah. Yo, don't do that. Don't do that." "I used to be paralyzed." Said, "I'm a walking miracle, bitch. Don't you ever disrespect me again." Speakin' of gettin' ass… Where the natural women at? Give it up for them 'cause they don't get enough love. Did somebody boo the natural women? Nothin' wrong with being natural. It's good. Everything is plastic these days. Everybody gettin' their body done. You wanna get your body done, I won't criticize. Your body. Do what you want. Just stop saying, "I did this for me." 'Cause you didn't. You did it to fit into society. 'Cause everything that men do, we do that shit for women. If it weren't for women, we wouldn't even brush our teeth. We'd be out this bitch with wooden teeth. They gettin' their work done, and the new thing is the fat transfer. You can't argue with a woman with a fat transfer. Fat transfer is when you take fat from one part of your body, then you shove it in your ass and titties. You can't argue with them 'cause they think it's still real. She's like, "Uh-uh, no, yeah, I got work done, but it's still me." "It's all real. Go ahead. Feel my ass." I grabbed it. She said, "What'd it feel like?" I said, "A arm." I said, "You got thigh, belly, back, neck." "Everything. Your ass is a hotdog." Motherfuckers don't like working out. When you get older, it just become harder for it to come off, right? Yep. I turned 43 this year. Who in their 40s? Clap your hands. Clap your hands if you in your 30s. Where the 30s? Yeah! 30s are worse than 40s. Know why? 'Cause your 30s are your decade of denial. You don't want to accept that you can't do the same shit you used to do. People here in their 20s can do stuff you take for granted. You in your 20s, you can do stuff like skip a shit. You can skip a shit. Somebody here in their 20s right now, they gotta shit, they're like… "Mmm…" "I don't feel like it." "I'll take a shit on Tuesday." 'Cause you got that kind of control over your ass. You turn 30, I dare you to skip a shit in your 30s. When it's time to go, it's time to go. Thinkin' you gonna wait till later, uh-uh, mmm-mmm. That shit get hard on you up in here. Get hard. Take one of them hard-ass shits. Wipe your ass. Ain't nothin' on the paper. "I know I just took a shit. Where's the doo-doo stain?" You got five rocks in your toilet, motherfucker. Then you turn 40, you start acceptin'. You accept life. It is what it is. Thing about 40, that's when you reflect. You look back like, "Damn, that shit went by fast as hell." "I do that shit again, I'm gonna be 80. Oh, shit." Then you try to figure out how you can beat the system. Like, "Shit. If I go vegan tomorrow… - …I'll probably live to like 105." You can't go vegan after eating bullshit for 40 years. Your body not gonna know how to react to that. You gonna get hit by a bike and die. You in the ICU. "What happened?" "He got hit by a bike." "A motorcycle?" "A Huffy." "He's not healing. He has no iron." Gettin' old is a bitch, man. I don't like old people. I don't. Get on my nerves. You ever be driving, got some old motherfucker in the crosswalk, make you miss the light? They either takin' slow long steps or quick short steps. They'll be staring at you, make sure you see 'em. "Get your quick slow ass out of the fuckin' street, man." "I'm tryin' to get to work, you out here moonwalking." Anybody seen their grandparents recently? Clap your hands. - Uh-huh, just a waste of time, right? That shit ain't fun. You uncomfortable as soon as you get there. Go in house, go use the bathroom, they got the toilet, then they got that other toilet seat above it. Ever see that? It's two inches below your ass. That's all you gotta do. You don't need no help getting up. Take a shit on that, and the splash will get on your neck. Old people always wanna be helpful. Won't sit their ass down, let them last few years ride out. Thanksgiving, my grandmother was trying to cook. I said, "No, Grandma, it's over." "You burned the turkey last year, sit down and watch Family Feud." She was mad. "No. This is my house. I gotta do something." I said, "What you wanna do?" She said, "Let me set the table." I said, "You can't fuck that up. Set the table." My grandmother got arthritis. She walk around with a fist, her hands are fucked up. She uses these two fingers for everything. After setting the table, she wanted to do extra. Started bringing drinks to the table. She got her fingers in everybody's drink. I said, "Nobody gonna say nothin'?" "I'm not drinkin' that shit." "Everybody's Kool-Aid tastes like Aspercreme?" What age do you start tellin' people you don't like their gift? My dad's 68. On his birthday, I bought him some Calvin Klein boxers. If you don't know, Calvin Klein boxers are like $30 apiece. I bought him five pairs. $150 on some drawers. My father wears Fruit of the Loom. He get five for $10. It's a good gift in my mind. I sent it to him, he didn't say shit. I called him, "Dad, did you get the gift?" "Yep." I said, "Did you like it?" He said, "Nah, them drawers got no dick holes." Who the fuck is using the dick hole? I thought that was decoration. People use that shit? I said, "Dad, why do you use the dick hole?" He said, "You never want 'em to catch you with your ass out." That shit made sense. My dad. That's my dawg. Got a great relationship with him. My dad named me. Named me Na'im. We like fake Muslims and shit, right? Uh… Back in the '70s, everybody was givin' their kids Muslim names. My dad named me Na'im. Mmm-hmm. Then he told me that my name means the star closest to Allah. I was like, "That's powerful. Thank you, Father." That's a great name. I got a tattoo on my arm that says, "Born a star." I said, "This is some powerful shit." Got a little older. Did some research. Mmm-mmm. No. Nope, no. Na'im means a nice piece of material. Motherfucker was born a blanket. Dad was on that shit. That's my dawg, though. Got clean, we got a better relationship. Motherfucker was doin' drugs back then. Who into drugs? Round of applause if you do drugs. Where you at? - Weed is a drug, in case you didn't know. How many levels of drugs are there? I think there's like three. Weed is one. What's three? What's… - Heroin. - Heroin. Meth. Meth, heroin, meth, crack. Anything that make your teeth fall out is level three. I ain't never done no drugs before. I've never smoked no cigarette, none of that shit, all right? Um… You know, guys, we'll take anything for our dick, though, right? We ain't gettin' no vaccine, but we'll take a dick pill. Don't need no research on that motherfucker. We be buying things we don't even want. We be at the gas station, "Let me get $20 on ten." Then we're like… "What's that shit back there with the rhinoceros on it?" The clerk is like, "No, my friend, try this one right here." "This one, all night, my friend." "Yeah, let me get the all-night shit." I took an edible one time, that's it. Worst mistake of my life. I knew that you're not supposed to eat the whole thing. I seen the movies. "You ate too much." I already knew that. I ate a quarter of a brownie. I was high for 30 fuckin' hours. Thirty hours. I ate this shit. I went… 'Cause I didn't feel nothing. I went to sleep. I woke up. I was high as hell. Went to the bathroom. I looked in the mirror. I was shrinking. I was like, "Oh, shit." "What the hell… This is high?" Went, got into bed, I laid down. My arms went up like this for no reason. I was in bed looking like a dead roach. I started tweaking and shit. My fingers started doing this. I was like, "Oh, shit. I'm sending somebody a long-ass email." "They'll be mad as hell when they get this shit." Sometimes funny stuff happens to me. I don't even gotta write jokes. One day, uh, I was on a plane, right? I'm on the plane, and this dude got on the plane with no arms. Y'all thinking there's nothing funny about a man with no arms. And you're wrong, all right? This shit was hilarious. I see him. First thing I think, "Oh, shit." "He ain't got no arms. Hope he's sitting next to me." "I'm in the middle seat, I want the armrest." Then I thought about it, I said, "I don't want him sitting next to me." "I gotta do everything for him." "I gotta put the seatbelt on, adjust the air." "I'm not doing this all flight and you laying like an earthworm. Fuck you." I started thinking, "How'd you lose your arms but your chest still here?" "What happened?" Started thinking, would I rather be missing an arm or a leg? What would y'all rather be missing? A leg? I don't know. I say leg. You can hide the fake leg. I knew a friend for five years before I found out he had a fake leg. I found out 'cause one day I pushed him in the pool. He had pants on. He got out, one of the pant legs was real tight, like this. "Yo." He said, "What?" I said, "Fuck you mean, 'what'?" "Why one of your legs like a goddamn candy cane?" He's like, "A'ight, you caught me." You can hide the fake leg. You can't hide the fake arm. First, the fake arm only come in one nationality. You Black, you out here with the white arm. And they make it like this. What the fuck is this? People don't walk around like this all day. What the fuck is this? Like you ready to meet somebody all day. "Who is this friendly motherfucker that just walked in here?" If I ever get a fake arm, I'm getting the cool fake arm. That shit gonna be just like this. You still the life of the party with this shit. You walk up in the club… Ah! Ah! You can dance to any music. Hip-hop, come on. You can salsa with this shit. Little reggae, come on. Blat, blat. You don't wanna be a young Black man these days with this shit. If a brother get pulled over by the police with this shit? "Oh, shit. The fuckin' police." - "License and registration, please." "I'm gonna ask you to put your weapon down." "Sir, I'm gonna ask you one more time to put your weapon down." "Oh, no." "No. I bought the cool fake arm on Amazon." "Get your hands up!" It's all right. He lives. Uh… The arm was white, remember? Look how I brought that back. That's some good writing. Thank you. Feeling good about life, man. I'm a father now. Late father. Took a long time to make that shit happen. What do y'all think? Have a kid early or wait till you're older? - Early… - Early? If you have a kid in your early 20s, and they grown when you in your 40s, now you tryin' to relive shit. You the old motherfucker in the club. Requesting songs they don't play no more. "Damn. Come on, DJ. Shit." "You gonna play 'U Can't Touch This' or what?" Having a kid is dope. I got a daughter. Guys don't want a daughter. Not first. We'll take like five, six sons, then we'll have a daughter. It's how it is. Women, y'all don't know this about men. We find out we're having a daughter, immediately, it could be at the reveal party, soon as we find out, we'll be like, "She gonna grow up to be a ho." "I can feel it." Then you have a daughter and it's the best thing in the world. That shit will fuck your relationship up, though. Having a kid. My lady… I know my lady. She bored with me. Here's the difference between men and women when it comes to marriage. Women, y'all might have a little kinky shit with your freaky shit. But you're kinda saving something for marriage 'cause that's when you can have sexual freedom. Don't need condoms, do whatever you want. You saving that. Men are the complete opposite. We tryin' to get every disgusting fantasy out before we get married. 'Cause you put your wife on a pedestal. You can't do certain… You can't spit on your queen. That's your queen. You can't come on your wife titty. That's the baby food. Meanwhile she want you to do all that shit. We had the baby. My daughter funny as hell, man. My daughter, she was, like, kinda slow to start talking. And people don't like talking about that shit, right? It's embarrassing. She was slow. She'd be at the park with other kids. They're havin' full conversations. My daughter's just sittin' there, slobberin' all over the place. Then you got some nosy bitch come over, "She's so cute. How old is she?" "Bitch, mind your own business." "Get the fuck out of here, Karen." She used to bust into the bathroom on me. I don't let my daughter see me naked. I think that's weird. She caught me one day. I'm in the bathroom. I'm in the shower. I got a shower door. She bust in and walked right up to the door. Poopy. She thought my dick was a piece of shit. I said, "Who told you that? Your mom tell you my dick was a piece of shit?" Stankin' bitch. She don't like me. My lady do not like me anymore. Usually, fellas, it'd be the woman that'd be tryin' to pursue the relationship. They find somebody, they want it official. I was like, "Nah, I ain't ready." She said, "Please." "Just be with me. Be with me. We can have something special." Cool, then you give up all your bitches. You get in a relationship. Then, like, two years later, they start being mean as fuck to you. You don't even know why. Fellas, you ever see that moment when you can tell they don't like you? They say something to you. You like, "This motherfucker don't like me no more." I know she don't 'cause she don't say "bless you" when I sneeze. I let out three in a row one day. I was like… She peeked into the room. Looked like she was trying to see if her poison worked. "Still alive." We argue. We argue about the fuckin' TV. The TV. Not what we're watching. We argue because I like to sleep with the TV on, her with the TV off. Clap your hands if you sleep with the TV on. - Where you at? Yeah. They're my people right there. Those are my people. Clap if you sleep with the TV off. Where you at? I said clap. I don't need no "whoos." Just clap. You got people who don't have a TV in their room at all. They're psychopaths. Person that don't have a TV in their room, they might kill your ass. I'mma explain to you the benefit of sleeping with the TV on. At some point in the middle of the night, you gonna wake up. When you wake up, you gonna realize it's not time to get up. And there ain't no sleep better than it's-not-time-to-get-up-yet sleep. You know what's better than one sleep? Two sleeps. Ladies, let me share something with you. You got a best friend, right? Your best friend move in with her man, know that is no longer your best friend. Stop telling her your secrets 'cause those are not your secrets. Those are our secrets. Because women that live with their man tell their man what? Everything. Anybody here on a double date? Look at the motherfucker next to you. They know all your shit. You're like, "They don't know about this." Yes, they do. 'Cause your woman told it. Then y'all get mad when we don't like your friend. "Why…" 'Cause you talk about this bitch every day. Why do you like her? Stop telling us stuff about your friends. Don't wanna hear it. We on the couch. We chillin'. We watching the game. You come sit next to us, jump on the phone, all loud. "What?" "Uh-uh, bitch, uh-uh." "Oh, my God." "Come on, girl. Who the fuck am I gonna tell, hmm?" "We've been friends how long? All right, then, all right." "Bye." "Debbie's got crabs." Stop tellin' us shit like that. 'Cause when you tell us stuff like that… Next time we see your friend, they come over, we'll be staring at them. We follow them around the house. "Hey." "Uh… where you goin'?" "No. The bathroom is out of order." "You take your crabby-patty ass outside, bitch." That's my time, y'all. I'm Na'im Lynn. Thank you all so much. Y'all, give it up for Na'im Lynn!
