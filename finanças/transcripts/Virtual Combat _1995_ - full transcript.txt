(pleasant music) (ominous music) (man breathing) (mechanical humming) (dramatic beat music) (fizzling) (thudding) (groaning) (yelling) - [Male Computer Voice] You have chosen well, David Quarry. Will you proceed? - [David] Advance me to level six. (mechanical humming) (dramatic beat music) (stomping) (ominous music) (grunting) (suspenseful music) (thudding) (groaning) (yelling) - [Male Computer Voice] You have chosen well once again. Will you proceed to level seven? - [David] Yes. (ominous music) (swishing) (suspenseful music) (thudding) (groaning) - Hi-yah! (swishing) (thudding) Yah! (groaning) (suspenseful music) (yelling) (groaning) (squelching) - [Male Computer Voice] You have chosen will. Will you proceed to level eight? - No, advance me to level ten. (wind howling) (somber music) (fizzling) (foreboding beat music) - [Demon Voiceover] So, we meet again, little man. Are you prepared to lose? (swishing) (groaning) (thudding) (suspenseful music) (laughing) I am Lethal Combat. Come, give me your rage! (thudding) (groaning) You can't beat me a my own game. I don't play by your rules. I can read your every thought. (thudding) (groaning) (yelling) (crunching) (slicing) (gasping) You have chosen poorly, David Quarry. Everyone loses to Dante! (screaming) (evil laughing) (David groaning) (computer beeping) - [Male Computer Voice] Warning, warning. Engage manual override. (gasping) It is not safe to exit program. (computer chiming) - Lose on level ten again? You can't win, Quarry. Everyone loses on level ten. I'm telling you, you gotta try cybersex. You always win, even if you're not an expert. - No thanks. - What's wrong with cybersex? It's guilt free, disease free sex with a perfect woman. - It's a computer program, John. You're having sex with a machine. - Ah, but a beautiful machine. One with big microchips. (somber beat music) - Stay at the luxurious Rivera Hotel, the finest in gaming and entertainment. Around the clock gambling and all the alcoholic beverages you can. Oh, the Riviera offers rooms special to qualified guests, of course, like you. No Las Vegas great vacation would be complete without visiting the Burtech Virtual Reality Arcade. Oh, play the forbidden games. Full body cybersex, Lethal Combat and western gunslinger body experience of a lifetime! Oh! - May I help you? Ready to play the forbidden games? - Yeah, two singles, my wife and I. - May I suggest the everything ticket? Two days of unlimited play for only 20 thousand credits. A significant savings over-- - No, no, just two singles please. - Hmm, well, choose your game. (cash register beeping) - [Female Computer Voice] Welcome to Cybersex by Burtech Industries. Press any key to continue. - I'm Greta and I'll give you some discipline. (woman moaning) - [Chainsaw Woman] I'm Bambi. - I'm Debbie and I'm lonely. Wanna play with me? (computer chiming) - [Female Computer Voice] Thank you for your selection. Please press any key to continue. (computer chiming) (yelling) (grunting) - [Man] Oh baby. (man moaning) I want you, so choose me. - [Female Computer Voice] Thank you for your selection and for experiencing Cybersex by Burtech. - I want Ken. - You naughty girl. Well, that'll be five thousand credits. 75 hundred including tax. Here's your card. Your tickets. Door is to your right. Enjoy. - Take me to Ken's world. - Give me Debbie. Stop me at level five. (chuckling) - I don't think so. (computer beeping) (whooshing) - I've been dying to meet you. I've heard so much about you. - Yeah? - Yeah. Like what? - Oh, you're so modest. You're just my type. Oh, what a big boy you are. Oh, Fred. Take me! - [Fred] Oh, Debbie. Oh! Oh, Debbie! (ominous music) (computer beeping) (foreboding music) - [Male Computer Voice] Prepare to engage. (phones ringing) Link accepted. Pornography select. Mind Expanders select. - [Woman Computer Voice] Unauthorized entry. Further access denied. - [Male Computer Voice] Downloading. (alarm beeping) Warning! Software robbery in progress. Warning! - Sir, data bank robbery in progress in sector 7-0-9. (ominous music) - Put in Sheckly and Smith. - Yes, sir. - [Male Computer Voice] Officers on route. (suspenseful music) - [Officer] Hold it! Los Angeles Police! (thudding) (foreboding music) (thudding) (groaning) (cracking) (ominous beat music) - [Male Computer Voice] Officer down. Officer down. - Check in on Smith and Hendricks. Call paramedics. Mobilize Grid Runner Unit. - Right away, sir. (ominous music) Station command to all Grid Runner Units. There's been a security breach in Sector 7-0-9. Be on the lookout for male suspects at all border checkpoints. (somber beat music) - We're at the dam, Mary. - Five suspects from data bank robbery are proceeding south, attempting to cross the boarder at Sector 15-07. Caution. Suspects are armed and dangerous. - We're all over it. (whooshing) (suspenseful music) (police siren alarming) (tires screeching) - Got this one. (thudding) (men groaning) You don't wanna do this. (thudding) (cracking) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (fizzling) Looks like I saved your butt again, man. - Never let a guy have any fun, do you? - How many times do I gotta tell you? Wear the taser. (computer chiming) - Mary, tell command we need a wagon out here and make sure they know there isn't any uniform for miles. - Yes, David. - Dr. Lawrence Cameron for Mr. Burroughs. - I know who you are, Dr. Cameron. You know the routine. (beeping) - [Male Computer Voice] No weapons. Clear for entry. - Access accepted, proceed. (dramatic organ music) (clapping) - Dr. Cameron. - I have something I think you should see. - Another cloning experiment. - Down in my lab. It will only take 15 minutes or so. - I'll give you 10. (pleasant music) - Hello, handsome. I'm Liana. I've been waiting to meet you. Waiting to please you. I'll do anything that you want. So play me. - Well, what do you think of her? (chuckling) - She's perfect, of course. But I've seen her program before. - What if she wasn't just a program? What if I could make her real? You see, this is my protoplasm tank. It's filled with a complex-- - In English, Cameron, please. We're not all experts in cyber plasma theory, you know. - There are no cells used in cloning. Manufactured cells that become anything with DNA engineering. Behold. (pleasant music) - Damn. She's real. - Of course I am. I've been waiting to meet you. I've heard so much about you. - You see, this Liana is a duplicate program. Dimensionalized from virtual reality to reality by copying a program from MD-Rom to disc. Only I have copied a program to living cells and this is the result. - Can you make more than one? - No. The configuration of the artificial intelligence circuits of the Los Angeles mainframe allow for only one Liana to exist at a time. But there are thousands of other cybersex programs. - Come here. There are people who will pay millions for a black market Liana VR program. I wonder how much they'd pay for the real Liana. It's artificial life. It's A-life. - And replenishable. - There's one problem, sir. Even though she's been programed to serve whoever plays her, she's also been programmed to learn which may present some difficulty in controlling her. That's why I've invented this. Any constant pressure over 500 PSI will cause deterioration. A slight jolt will cause pain. She's all yours. (buzzing) (gasping) - Ruby, make appointments with all our overseas customers. They must meet me in person, Los Angeles headquarters, Burtech, on Tuesday. Make sure they understand that anybody who does not attend will be frozen out of all future Burtech properties. - Yes, Mr. Burroughs. - Cameron, how much does each unit cost? - Millions of cells involved. - Have an analysis on my desk on Monday at noon. Who is the second most popular cybersex program? - Greta, the dominatrix. - Make one for me. - Parness? - [Parness] Yes, Mr. Burroughs. I'd like to see you here in the lab, immediately please. (ominous music) (computer chiming) - [Female Computer Voice] Access accepted. (bubbling) Tank activated. (tank bubbling) (dramatic music) - Absolutely fabulous. Parness, I need to transport these two samples into the Los Angeles Grid without going through security checkpoints. - Well, the Bullet Train requires ident-o-credit, I could cross the boarder at Arizona and take the old I-40. - Have a plan on my desk at five o'clock. - Right. - Cameron, you've outdone yourself. There will be a bonus on your desk at the end of the month. Well done. - You gotta lighten up, David. Start using your credit for something other than training. Hell, that's half the reason I became a Grid Runner. Unlimited use of VR. All work, no play. - It's gonna get me past level 10 someday. - Oh, you're a poet. - By the way, what does Cathy think about cybersex? - What do you mean? - Does she do it? - She did before we were married. - And now? - Well, it just so happens we discussed it. So I made her this, check it out. It's my virtual self. That way, when she's having cybersex, it won't be with a stranger. Of course, I made some improvements. Some things a little smaller and other things a little bigger, if you know what I mean? - You mean, he's not a quick draw like you. (laughing) (ominous music) - [Female Computer Voice] Tank activated. (tank bubbling) (foreboding music) Tank shut down. (computer chiming) (gasping) - What do you want? - [Dante Voiceover] I have friends trapped in your mainframe prison. Get them out, now! (computer chiming) - [Female Computer Voice] Access accepted. Tank activated. (bubbling) - [Dante Voiceover] Con from level seven. Welcome. - [Female Computer Voice] System abort! Mainframe override. May not be restarted from this location. - [Dante Voiceover] What have you done? - The tank is completely shut down. - [Dante Voiceover] Start it! - I can't. The only way to reactivate the tank is through the mainframe of the Los Angeles Grid. (groaning) (cracking) (thudding) (men grunting) (suspenseful music) - [Guard] Hey, hey helmet! (groaning) (cracking) - [Dante Voiceover] No one beats Dante! (yelling) (groaning) (foreboding music) (electrical fizzling) - We'll wait until nightfall. When the boarder guards all leave, we'll have about five minutes to cross. - Aren't there surveillance satellites? - A section of the grid will be blacked out for two hours due to a computer malfunction. (traffic commotion) - Gentlemen, what can I get you? - Beer! - Coffee. - Coming right up. - You might as well work at the LA Grid or New York. Keep up the goody two-shoes routine and they're gonna ship you off to the Ohio Grid. I hear you have to be married to even look at a naked woman there. - Here you go, gentlemen. - Come on, what's up with you? You've been acting weird for the past six months. - I've been training. - For what, the tight-ass Olympics? - I wanna get passed level 10. - Dante. It's a computer program. You can't beat a computer at a computer game. It's impossible. I'm worried about you, Quarry. I mean, if you stopped drinking for a good reason, like her over there, at least I could understand. To change your whole lifestyle for a computer game? And you think I'm weird for wasting my credits on cybersex. (ominous music) - [Officer] Holt! Holt right there! Just step out of the vehicle, sir. - Do you know who I am? - Just step out. - I'm John Carter Burroughs, president of Burtech Industries. - I'm sorry, sir, I didn't recognize you. You see, we've had a Code Red in the area. Well, if you'd like, I can arrange for an officer for an escort. - No, that won't be necessary. - No sir, really, it's no problem at all. I'll be right back. - Greta? (ominous music) - [Greta] Hey! Hey, just a minute. (officer groaning) (whip cracking) (suspenseful music) (whip cracking) (officer groaning) (electrical fizzling) (officer groaning) - [Dante Voiceover] Liana. Liana. Liana, where are you? Let me see into your mind. Let me see where you are. (fighting commotion) Who is with you? (gagging) - [Greta] Come here. Get on your knees, baby. - [Dante Voiceover] Ah, Greta. (cracking) Who is the intruder? The human male? - Remember that move, Greta. Now get in. Liana? - [Dante Voiceover] Who is he? - Burroughs. - Liana?! Now, come on! - [Dante Voiceover] Escape. - I can't. - [Dante Voiceover] Why are you crossing at that sector? - Satellite security down for two hours. - Come on, now, damn it! The guards are on their way! - [Dante Voiceover] Go! - [Burroughs] Liana, let's go now! (guards marching) (tires screeching) - [Guard] Who are these people? - [Dante Voiceover] Everyone loses to Dante. - [Guard On Radio] Code Red! Code Red! Sector 23-019, officer down! Available unites respond! - One more. - I think you've had enough. - Hey, let's go check out that Code Red. - Forget it, John, we're off the clock. - Yeah. You're right. All that's left is the paperwork. - Come on. We've got an early day tomorrow and Cathy's probably waiting up for you. - No, I already called her. She's in bed. No action tonight. (laughing) - So you sure you don't want a ride home? - No, I'm fine man, go ahead. - You sure? - Please, go home, mother. (chuckling) I'll catch you tomorrow. (somber music) - Max, what's the status on that Code Red emergency? - False alarm. - What's the satellite recon show? - Satellite recon was negative. - Max, punch me up a map of that sector. All right, now highlight the sectors where the border patrol left a pulse to respond. (beeping) (ominous music) - [Guard] What are you doing here, Grid Runner? - Just getting a little fresh air, how're you doing? (chuckling) (ominous music) (beeping) Hey, Max, taking a few notes here. I think I got like three sets of footprints. Two female, one male. Looks like they crossed the line at sector... 23-019. Just passed the dam. - [Max] 23-019. (man groaning) (foreboding music) - Las Vegas Grid Patrol, freeze! (menacing music) I said, freeze! (fizzling) That's a warning! Stop where you are! Damn it, freeze! (fizzling) (menacing music) (thudding) (communicator chiming) Max, looks like we're gonna need an ambulance out here at Hoover Dam. (ominous music) You've gotta be kidding me. (thudding) (groaning) (crunching) (swishing) (grunting) (dramatic music) Mayday! Mayday! Officer needs assistance. Mayday! Mayday! - Mayday! Mayday! Officer needs assistance! (crunching) (menacing music) (groaning) - [Dante Voiceover] Everyone loses to Dante. (crunching) (laughing) - That's it. We analyzed the black box chip form his pippin. He was chasing two women and a man who crossed illegally into LA Grid. - I'd like a copy of that, sir. - Sorry. We sent the description to LAPD. It's their baby now. - He was my partner. - It's not your case and not your place, don't push me. - Sir, I don't trust the LAPD! - As long as you're in this department, Quarry, you follow orders and procedure! (ominous music) - You'll have my resignation in the morning. - Pick up that badge. Pick it up! You're throwing your life away, boy, your future! Jobs like this aren't easy to find. You go out there and get yourself killed. You don't know what you're doing! - Yes I do. - Look, Quarry, you get out there anywhere near these three people, you call me. I'll arrange for back up, clear it with the LAPD. You got that? I get a call before you move, not after! You understand? (ominous music) - Does Cathy know? - No. (dramatic music) (buzzing) - Cathy. - Get out of my way! Just get out of my way. - I'm sorry. - Just go away. Go away! (baby cooing) If you leave now, none of this has to happen, okay? Just walk out that door and take that bag with you and John will come home and everything will be just fine. - I'm sorry, Cathy. - John is just out drinking. You know how he gets. He starts having a good time and he forgets to call and dinner gets cold and I get upset but then he comes home and we work everything out. - He's not coming home. - That's because you got him killed! (crying) - No, I wasn't there. I wish I had been. I wish to God I had been. I don't know what to say. - I don't know what to do. I already have his anniversary present and now... - I think you should call your sister. Ask her to come over and stay for awhile. - Okay. - Do you want me to do it? - No. No, I can handle it. (dramatic music) - Look, I'm gonna take care of this. You need to be strong. You know he loved you. - I know. (baby cooing) David? Get the bastards. (dramatic music) (ominous music) - Hey, Grid Runner! Hey, Grid Runner, I'm talking to you. I heard you got fired. Couldn't follow orders. - I'm just here to check out the crime scene. - Police personnel only. (suspenseful music) - Three questions and I'll let you go. Did you find any abandoned vehicles? - No! - Did you check the Bullet Train to LA? - Yeah. Nothing. - Check the roads? - Waste of time. They'd need a vehicle. Hey! It's true what they say about Grid Runners. You're just scum chasing scum. (dramatic music) - I don't know, John. Would you go after them? Or just get on with your life? (chiming) Mary, play this back for me. (fizzling) (beeping) - [John] Mayday! Mayday! Officer needs assistance! Mayday! Mayday! (Dante laughing) (fizzling) - Mary, who programmed the Lethal Combat game? - [Mary] Checking. Information unavailable. - Who pulled the file? - Doctor Lawrence Cameron. - Check his recent credit purchases. - Purchased ticket on Bullet Train last night, 11:03. Destination, Los Angeles. (ominous music) (whooshing) (suspenseful music) - [Announcer] Welcome to the Los Angeles Grid. A violence-free community. We hope you enjoy your stay. (electronic beeping) - Ladies. - Welcome home, Mr. Burroughs. The entire staff of the Los Angeles Grid sends its greetings, sir. - Well thank them for me, Parness. Ruby, have our offshore clients confirm our little auction tomorrow? - Yes, all but the People's Republic of England. - Well, God save the King. Mr. Parness, see them to their rooms. I think they'll be most comfortable in the old Burtech warehouse. See that they're well protected. Ruby? - Yes, Mr. Burroughs. - People's Republic of England, their Prime Minister, I'd like to speak to him right away. - [Ruby] Yes, Mr. Burroughs. (foreboding music) - I'm sure you'll feel at home. I want you here, two at the front, two down the hall. You come with me. - [Burroughs] To the point, please, I'm a very busy man. - [Man] I'm sorry, sir, there's a Nevada Grid Runner. He's on his way to Los Angeles. He might be chasing you. His partner was killed at the boarder. - You should've stopped him. - [Man] That's right, sir, but he's gone renegade. He turned in his badge. They say he's a top man in his department. - I want his file, I want his photograph and I want it now! (ominous music) (printer beeping) Parness! This renegade border cop is on his way here from Vegas. I'd like for you to stop him. Permanently. Take your best men. He's supposed to be good. (beeping) (suspenseful music) - [Female Announcer] Last call. Bullet train to the Las Vegas Grid departing from track nine. - [Male Announcer] Welcome to the Los Angeles Grid. A violence-free community. We hope you enjoy your stay. (police sirens alarming) (ominous music) - Excuse me. - You ain't going nowhere. - Ha! (suspenseful music) (groaning) - Just a minute, just a minute. He's mine. Should've stayed in Vegas, Quarry. - [David] Do I know you? - [Parness] Let me introduce myself. (thudding) (suspenseful beat music) (thudding) (police siren alarming) (car tires screeching) - Los Angeles Police Department! Everyone remain where they are! Hold it right there, buddy! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it, get back here! - Just a minute, officer, I'm sure you'll find everything in order. Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Go get him. - Sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Parness. - It's quite all right, officer. - Have a good day. - Thank you. (suspenseful music) - You're mine now, sucker! (thudding) (ominous music) - [David] Prison barcode. - [Dante Voiceover] Liana. Greta. Where are you? Greta. - Dante. - [Dante Voiceover] Where are you? - They took us to a building where we were created. - [Dante Voiceover] The Mainframe? - [Greta Voiceover] It's near there. - [Dante Voiceover] You must escape and come to me. - [Greta Voiceover] I'm not programmed for strategy. - [Dante Voiceover] Let me see the room. (ominous music) Good. Very good, Greta. Now listen to me carefully. Here's what you do. - Commander, they were all ex-cons. I saw a barcode on one of them. But when the police stopped them, the leader showed his ID and they let him go. - [Doyle] That would take political pull, Quarry. Someone very powerful's involved in this. - Right. How'd they know I was coming to LA? - They must have someone in the department. Until I find out who the leak is, don't talk to anyone except me. - It's gonna be light soon. I gotta find a place to hide out. - What hotel are you staying in? - I don't know. (police radio commotion) I gotta go. (ominous music) (communicator chiming) Mary, get me the address for Burtech Industries. (foreboding music) (somber beat music) (communicator chiming) Mary, get me a bio on Dr. Cameron. - Tracking. Dr. Lawrence Cameron. Born, Vienna, Austria. Specialist in cyber plasmic theory. Studied cloning technology at Stanford. - Wait. What's cyber plasmic theory? - Cloning from a computer program. Dr. Cameron, in his latest paper, theorizes that in the near future, we will be able to maintain a central data bank of computer encoded specifications for replacement limbs. (communicator chiming) - What'd you see out there, John? (shushing) (foreboding music) (whipping) (groaning) - Bring me the keys. (gagging) Do it! (thudding) (suspenseful music) - [Guard] Hey! Hey! (thudding) - We've gotta find Dante. - I'm not going with him. - Mr. Burroughs! Mr. Burroughs! They've escaped, sir. - They won't get far. Track them. I can always kill them. - Yes, sir. Let's go! (ominous music) (dramatic beat music) (swishing) (Dante laughing) (people chattering) (somber music) - Try it? Here you go. Apart and take your middle finger. Perfect. Here you go, you got it. (chuckling) Please, don't. Don't! Stop! Ew! - She said no! (whimpering) (thudding) (groaning) Are you okay? - Yes. - I'm Quarry. - I'm Liana. (clanking) Who are you hiding from? - I'm just here helping a friend. You're on the run? - No, I just need some place to stay. - That's probably got a tracking chip in it. They'll find you. Come on. We'll get it off. (somber music) (door creaking) (communicator chiming) Mary, give me a systems analysis on this tracking device. - [Mary] Tracking. (beeping) Tonco Pressure Band. - Just tell me how to remove it. - [Mary] After disengaging tamper system, both halves must be removed simultaneously or band will activate and crush the neck of wearer at 500 PSI. - How do I deactivate the tamper system? - I can scramble the system for you for 1.743 seconds. If you have not removed the band within that time, you will receive a lethal jolt of electrical current. I can not recommend this, David. - Hold this. (dramatic music) Ready? Mary, scramble it. - [Mary] Scrambling now. (fizzling) (gasping) - Are you all right? - Yes. What a strong man you are. Why don't you help me off with my clothes? (somber music) What's wrong? - [David] I hardly know you. - But you could get to know me. Come on, Quarry. Why don't you help me off with my clothes? What's wrong? You don't like me? Is there something wrong with me? I thought I was appealing. - It's not that. It's just-- - What am I doing wrong, Quarry? I try to do everything that men want. - You should try to do what you want. - I don't know what I want. I'm not allowed to think like that. - Don't. Don't cry. - Cry? It's strange, I've never cried before. - It's okay. - Please hold me. (somber music) (dramatic music) Mmmm. (dramatic music) (footsteps thumping) - How'd they find me? - Those men are after me. (ominous music) - Go! (suspenseful music) (groaning) (swishing) (thudding) (suspenseful music) (crunching) (groaning) (yelling) (thudding) (ominous music) (taser buzzing) Let's go! (suspenseful music) (booming) (tasers fizzling) (fire crackling) - [Burroughs] Yes, Mr. Parness? - I'm sorry, sir, I've lost them. - [Burroughs] Find them. (suspenseful music) (helicopter buzzing) - [David] This way! (helicopter buzzing) - Why are those men chasing you? - I'm a Las Vegas Grid Runner. My partner was tracking two women and a man. They killed him when they crossed the border. I'm after them and I must be getting close. - [Liana] The three that you're after didn't kill your partner. - [David] How do you know? - [Liana] Because I'm one of the women. - Then you're with Cameron. - Dr. Cameron's dead. Dr. Cameron was killed right after I was created. - Created you? What are you talking about? - Dr. Cameron cloned me from a virtual reality program with Greta, another artificial life. - [David] Artificial life? - It's true. I am a program. (dramatic music) What's wrong? - Then who killed my partner? - [Liana] The killer from Lethal Combat. - Lethal Combat? What level? Who is it? - Dante. He killed Dr. Cameron and your partner. Now he's here and he wants to reactivate the tank. All the killers from virtual reality, he's gonna bring them back to life. (ominous music) - Let's go. (dramatic beat music) (train horn blowing) We have to find Dante. Can you help? - No, I'm not programmed to-- - You're not a computer program anymore. You understand? - Yes. I should do whatever I want to do. But maybe I can help. (dramatic beat music) (huffing) - What's the matter? - [Dante Voiceover] She's calling me. Can't you hear her? Someone's with her. I can feel him. - Can you see where she is? - [Dante Voiceover] Yes. Bright colored signs. Japan Town. (ominous music) - I think it worked. - Great, let's go. - Mr. Burroughs. We found one of the A-lifers. Little Tokyo, we're headed there now. (somber beat music) - What's wrong? - I can feel him. (somber beat music) There he is. - Dante. (Dante grunting) (thudding) - [Dante Voiceover] You are mine. We were created for each other like light and darkness. (ominous music) (thudding) (suspenseful music) (thudding) (yelling) (whooshing) (communicator chiming) - Mary, analyze. What killed her? - Solid hits to precisely the same location compress the A-lifer's molecular structure causing a breakdown in electrical impulses at 500 PSI against solid matter. - 500 PSI. Solid matter. (foreboding beat music) (thudding) (fizzling) (fighting commotion) - [Dante Voiceover] Liana. Liana! (ominous music) (banging) - We got her, Mr. Burroughs. We should be to you in approximately 20 minutes. Mr. Burroughs is very upset with you. - [Mary] Commander Doyle on the line. (communicator chiming) - [Doyle] Quarry? - Sir, I know who killed Gibson. It was an A-lifer. - How can a computer program kill someone? - A scientist name Cameron was experimenting with cloning from computer data. He cloned three VR characters. - Cameron was murdered. - I know that but remember when you said powerful might be involved in this? - Yes. - There's a major corporation. - Not another word. This isn't a secure line. Where are you? - Hotel Terioshi, Little Tokyo. - Hold tight, I'll be there in an hour and a half. Whatever you do, don't talk to the LAPD. We don't know if they're in this or not. (chiming) (ominous music) - What about the other one? - No reading on her at all. - This will keep you on your best behavior. - You don't own me! (buzzing) - Well, my, my, my. You've forgotten your programming. You're supposed to do what you're told. Now find the other one and kill that damn border cop. It's no big deal, just do it. - Yes, sir. (ominous music) - Cloning A-lifers, that's amazing. - Look, Dante's trying to get to the mainframe. If he does, he can dimensionalize every VR character in the data bank. We have to shut down the mainframe. - We can't. The city uses that computer for code red calls and emergency services. How do you know Mr. Burroughs is involved? - This is on one of the female A-lifers. - What happened to her? - She's gone. - This is too big for us. We can't go barging in and arresting someone like J.C. Burroughs without a ton of evidence! This is not enough.

Your boss got him killed. - Well maybe he'll do the same for you. - Well, I've been saving something very special. And now it seems like the perfect occasion. Now, there's only one bullet but that's all it takes. - You can shoot me but what're you gonna do about the third A-lifer? (gun clicking) (chuckling) - What third A-lifer? - Dante from Lethal Combat.

And only this can stop it. My friends from the games will be free. Are you prepared to lose again? - I'm not gonna lose. This time it's not a game. (Dante laughing) (dramatic music) (thudding) - [Dante Voiceover] You can't win. You helped make me stronger. Every time you fought me, I got better. (groaning) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (groaning) You've had my power until I became the very champion of darkness, your darkness. Your evil.
