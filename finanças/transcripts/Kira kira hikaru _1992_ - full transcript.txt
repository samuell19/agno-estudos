Shoko. . Don't cry. Well, why don't we introduce ourselves? How do you do? I'm Kishida Mutsuki. Kayama Shoko The cakes are quite good, even though... ... they don't look like much. Please, try some. Shoko, your work involves Italian? Yes, she works in translation. That's wonderfull! It's not some job everyone could do. Well, she isn't able to survive on it yet. Oh, but there's lots of time. She is still young. Well, we're glad she has one thing she's good at. Why don't you talk? 'Cause you aren't! Oh, that's why? Yes, that's why. I hate the feeling that I have to talk. It's in better taste to stay quiet than talk. Ginjiro died this morning. Sorry? Nothing. Someone you knew? It's nothing to do with you. You brought it up. Ever heard of skipping? Yeah... Do you know how? Don't you? I drive you home. I said It's okay! Don't be stubborn. Hey... what are you doing? Buying a platform ticket. I hate people standing around till I leave.

Wait a bit more. It's not my fault. Huh? What? What did you just say? You order?... Not that... what did you say just now? Nothing. So it's my fault? I didn't say that. Coffee for me. It must be a bad romance. Her boyfriend is an idiot. I'll have a coffee, too. And don't spit in it or put in dandruff or staples! Listen, I can walk home from here. It's all right! Go over and see him. But he stood us up. Oh, don't be like that! But Shoko... It's OK. I'm back. That was quick. I don't mind you drinking, but within limits. . Within limits? Think of your health. I mean. I didn't know you could... drink within limits. I thought you just drink... to get drunk. You're not my guardian. So... did you see him? I didn't get married to be your guardian. I'm not that good hearted. You're Kon, aren't you? Yes. Well, next time you make a promise, keep it. Am I out of place here? What do you want? What a way to talk! Okay, I'm sorry. What for? For not coming. Don't say things you don't mean. Nothing I say will satisfy you. Just tell me why you didn't come. You sure have nerve coming here. I sure do. I can see who controls who. Come and visit us. Come and do what? Hey, Fukushima! See you 'round. Hey... I'm glad I met you. . Here's our address and phone number. I don't need it. You got it from Mutsuki? No, I don't. Then take it. Go on? They'll think we're having an affair! There's nothing students like better than gossip. How are you? Uh... cream soda. She's in a good mood today. Nice day today, wasn't it? Yeah it was. . it was a very nice day. What is it? What are you looking at? At you, of course. You had some good news? I met Kon. You believe anything I say! That's not funny... Doctor has to learn to keep a straight face. I guess so. You can't let everything show. You're next patient, Doctor. Mr. Fukushima. And how are we today? Not too good. That's too bad. Well, it's not too good. It's like I'm coming down with a cold. Why are you angry? You know you shouldn't come here. That's what I wanted to say. It's embarrassing, isn't it? I thought so too. You're her husband, so tell her... . . not to come waltzing over to see me. I see. No, you don't understand. I don't understand what? This stupid marriage make things difficult. It's not stupid. Oh, yeah... It was a marriage of convenience. Why not try sex with her? It's getting cold. There's twice as much as usual. I've gotten lazy. This is like real work! Shoko... Uh... you're doing great. Thanks. This is a very nice room. So you come to see what kind of place we had? I feel sorry for your parents. Oh, no. . they're delighted. That's because they don't know. No. . and they don't have too. Being married to him must be like... ... eating soup with a fork. You're still against it... aren't you? She's good at skipping. That's right... you can't, can you? I'm getting better. Because of him. How's it going? Not bad. You should have had a ceremony. Too much trouble. You haven't changed a bit! How's work? I'm getting by. Well you're looking a lot better. Anyway, let him make you as happy as he can. Bye, bye! Good morning, . . nice day, isn't it? Well, come in. Want a drink? Uh... What... ? It's still a little early... What would you like then? Orange juice, or... It's ready. Come and get it. It smells good. A holiday morning, a wife... . . it's great, like paradise. Well, today's a work day, and I'm not yor wife. This is good! I wish I had a wife. A wife is a woman. Are these from California? I knew it! In spring... California then Florida or Valencia in summer. So... Why did you come? No reason. I see. That's right. I come without a reason. Did you now? I'll be going then. Why? No reason to be here. All you have to do is say so. Stop sulking! Then what should I do? Just sit back and relax. Shall we go. . This is fine. I can't stay long. This won't take a minute. I've been thinking... Shoko knew the truth, but she still married you. That makes her all the more precious. What do you mean? You can't be just married in name. If her parents found out... ... may ask you two to divorce. You're also robbing Shoko of a greatest joy So what do you suggest? Well, if only you'd just make an effort... Are you serious? Yes! Or you could... ... try artificial insemination. What a revolting idea! I want grand-children! That's what I mean. I won't give up! Hello! I've been rude not to call. I'm the rude one. You've done so much for my son. Well, I've got rounds to do. Yes, I musn't keep you from your work. Well, I'll be going then. Goodbye. Thanks a lot. I can imagine... All the more in your case I'm home. You're back... Making soba is really hard! That's not the way. Hold on... Look how it came out. I'm not the one who can do this. I'll do it. You boil some water. Thanks for the bath. Well, let's get to the soba. Quiet! I bought some ice cream for dessert... Great! Vanilla and Strawberry. Which one do you want? Strawberry, he says... I'll make some tea. I'll do it. That's all right. Relax. Are you two... having fun? What are you trying to do... make fun of me? No! Don't say the same thing at the same time! He's not being much fun. Go away. All right. That wasn't very nice. Why don't you say something I wasn't very nice? No. Don't be an idiot. What do you mean? Come on. Settle down. Are you still here? I'm going. Sorry to have put you out. See you. I had a good time. You're very narrow-minded. Jerk! Stop your fighting... ... both of you... ... don't fight over me... ... from now on. ... I'll fall in love ... with somebody different Excuse me, but you'll annoy the other customers. Could you stop. Please. Uh, excuse me... Sir? No. I'm sorry. It's not your fault, ist it? But instead of my singing, why don't you tell... ... these snot-nosed dickheads... ... to stop their dog shit jokes?! Kon! What happen to you? Oh, It's nothing. I walked into a lamp post. Again? That's what you always say! Then a bike run over me. Don't make fun of me. Just kidding. I know that. Are you all right? It's lonely without Ginjiro. It would be. We might get another dog. That might be good. Why don't you? But someday It'll die too, and It'll be one more thing to be sad about. But, you'll be together till that happens I'll be with you You're growing up at last! Are you playing your part? You were always to proud to play the good wife. I'm doing my best. Really? Excuse me... The fired oyster... ... and filet outlet specials. Another beer, please. Yes, just a second. So they haven't fired you yet? No. People like you... ... have taught me patience. People grow, don't they? How many is that? Her fifth. She's very quiet. You never know when she is going to blow up. You're still up? Hello You're always the same! Hey... ... make love to me. It's time to say good night. You don't have much of a sense of humor. I guess not. How should I say this? Do you think you could... ... stop flaunting around... ... how meek and gentle you are? I can't do anything for you. What? What did you say? I'm saying you need a lover. You always sound so serious, but what you say... ... doesn't make any sense to me at all. To a drunk, I guess, I won't. Yeah, you're propably right. Imagine, telling a homo you want children! It's to laugh... Well, I will If you insist, but... ... I still don't understand. I'm quite busy, to tell the truth We having a different timing. Of course, it's not an excuse. Find her a man to take your place. Must be a reliable person. But... can it help? Shoko is working too hard. Need to have a break sometime. I need more time to concentrate on my work It's abnormal. You don't worry about that? I won't. Nothing will happen between me and Shoko. Anyway. Shoko need friends. Man or woman, it's okay. I see But If Shoko find herself a new lover... A Lover? I'd fight back. I have to get back. Thanks for coming. Oh, that' s all right... Would you think about it? Well, I see you. What are you doing out there in the dark? Let's party! Shoko... You shouldn't work so hard! I fell better when I'm working. I'm not thinking about other things. I'm not so irritated. I work tonight. Good, It's been a while. If you're never alone you get stale. The clock that was bought... ... on the morning Grandfather was born... ... doesn't work any more. That clock... ... 100 years without pause, tick-tock... All Grandfather's live... Now it doesn't work any more... Settle down. Shoko! I can't understand you if you are crying. What happen? I know that Mutsuki is working tonight. Mutsuki... he's so kind! What's wrong with that? He makes my angry! Why? Because he's so kind! He might not phone tonight. Are you in love? No! You are! No, I'm not! Why not have a kid? What are you talking about?! It might settle you down. That isn't it at all! Yes, it is! You'll keep everyone on edge If you go on like this... Mutsuki suffers the most. And why'd you get married, anyway? You wouldn't understand! What's that supposed to mean? The truth, that's all. Shoko, this gone far enough! You haven't got a clue! Listen, Mutsuki called me! He asked me to find you a lover! You're losing him! Shoko... hello? I'm back. Get away! You are disgusting... Whatever's wrong, you don't... ... need to act like that! Mizuho isn't my friend anymore. And you know why? What?! You're not! That's it... ... it's not her fault! He hit me. That's bad. I'm jeolous. No matter what I've done. He never hit me. I'm amazed you got him to do something like that. Really? Yeah! That's serious. What is it? Well, I mean... it's like... ahh. . forget it. Did you get hurt? Mutsuki and I... ... haven't slept together, you know? I think about him all the time. What about you? What about me?! We're a lot alike. . you and me. Without Mutsuki... ... we're both lonely. Hey... do you want to go to the beach? The ocean's fantastic, isn't it... It's freezing! You're not cold? Are you OK? I'm fine. This is the first time. The first time you ever hold me. Sorry. Hey... What? Your socks look weird like that. You think without them we won't look weird? They're fine like this. Give me a break! Sorry to keep you waiting, this way... Thank you! Morning Morning Morning Morning Where's my wallet? I saw it on the table. Well... ... I'll see you. Have a good day. I'm going. Can't be late vor school. You're so serious all of a sudden. See you, then. See you later. How long will you wait? We can't just stay quiet. We won't know if we don't call. I'm home. What time will Shoko be back? I didn't ask her... later this afternoon. It's allright. It's you I want to talk to. All right. I don't know how to say this. . ... I mean, eh... ... Mizuho came over, and she told us... ... about this, this... what shall we call it? This unexpected news... ... it isn't true, is it? It is true. Wait, now... settle down. All right You're not... ... what I mean to say is... you're not... ... I don't want you to misunderstand me... ... all this I hear... ... about you being a homosexual and all... That's right. You... It's the truth. But this was an arranged marriage! There was nothing about that on your resume It's true. My son-in law is a fairy! That's crazy! Tell me you're joking! We were tricked! I can't believe it! And you, such a fine looking young man! Did he go? What now? If we were tricked, so were you. He doesn't understand anything! Take this once a day, at bedtime. Fine. Thank you very much. Take care of yourself. Where's mom? At the hairdresser's. So you've come to tell me what I should do? I plan to bow down very, very low. You won't have to. I know what I'm going to do. Then why did you come? Her parents called. So mom's at the hairdresser... Don't sneer at that. People judge you on how you look. So you're worried about... ... what your mother and I are going to say. Dad... ... you think that serves me right I knew this was going to happen. So you do think so? Of course you would. After all. I'm the son who betrayed you. That's right. But I don't worry about that any more. Bullshit Weren't you going to stay a bachelor? Didn't you say you'd live alone? And now you dragged someone else into it. Get out! Dr. Kishida... ... imagine you had a daughter... ... and that this was happening to you. I mean, he is not qualified to be married! Qualified? Isn't love the main thing? We just watch to see that... Loves takes responsibility. Responsible to make the other's happy. Fine words, those. Would you stop, please! I assume this was a marriage of convenience to you. It's that what you think? It's was for you, too. I'm an alcoholic. That's enough, Shoko. Why are you all blaming Mutsuki! You should find somebody else. There's only one Mutsuki. What do you think Mutsuki? I think we're fine as we are. Then you'll break of with your lover? We're fine as we are! Don't interrupt. I'm thinking about her future. Hey! Don't you understand that? Dad, stop it!!! Doctor, there's a Mrs. Kishida to see you. This way. What can I do for you? I'd like to ask you something. It's about insemination... Oh... what?! What would you like to know about it? If we can or not! I think this involves you and your husband. The condition under which is performed... ... to speak very generally... ... involves infertility in husband or wife. What I want to know... What I want to know is... can you mix my husband's and Kon's sperm into a tube ... and fertilize me with it? I'm not sure I understand you. So I have both their child. But... But what? Hi! Hello. She wanted to meet you. I don't have any older doctor friends! I'm Ritsuko. How do you do? How do you do? May he'll buy as dinner. Sushi, maybe... Whatever. What's eating you? She likes me. Maybe I should get close to her... I don't want to hurt Shoko any more. Shoko... ... needs me. Tell me one thing... Tell me! Do you love me? Yes. I love you. You're back. Yeah. Hey... Notice anything? These? I thought you hated them. Just for a change. I lied to my mother. I told her you and Kon broke up. Did she believe you? They invited us to dinner. So I should tell them we're going to try for a baby! We have to compromise somewhere... ... if we want our lie to work. We could at lease have one! The say GIFT method is... Stop right here! We have a kid so that... ... everyone accepts us? Yes! Would you like a new cup? I don't know... Maybe I'll switch to alcohol. Shall I bring you a beer? I'll stay with coffee. I guess. Hey... ... do you have a boyfriend? Yes. Do you live with him? Yes. Do you get along? Of course. Are you happy? You'll be happy, if you try to be, ma'am. Where are we going? I'll take you back. Let's go home. When we get there, we can live how we want. The past can be past... ... and the future is future. Then I'm not going home. What a pair of losers! You make me laugh. Say something! It was fun, Shoko. I'll slap you if you say you've choosen to live alone! Well, she's gone. To tell the truth, it's a relief. So now you won't be hemmed in any more. I was wrong... I thought you knew what loving someone was. And then we get in this mess. It's a damn shame. Are you going to leave it like that? Can't you go after her? I knew you couldn't be a husband. ... but you could at least be human. I was stupid. Now you're just memories. ... for Shoko and for me. What's going on here? That antique clock... ... belong to my Grandfather... ... working for 100 years... ... never stop... ... that morning when my Grandfather was born ... they bought it back... ... now it doesn't work anymore... that clock ... working for 100 years... ... tick, tock... ... live with my Grandfather... ... tick, tock... ... now it doesn't work any more... that clock...
