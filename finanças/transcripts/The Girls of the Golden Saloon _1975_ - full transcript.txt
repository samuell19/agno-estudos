September 9th, 1850. Thanks to the numerous victories of General Fremont and his troops, California becomes a state. After the Guadalupe Hidalgo Treaty, Mexico gives away to the United States, New Mexico and California in exchange for $15 million. It is not just an annexation. It is a forced sale. In every city, every village, the old flags were taken away and replaced by the Star Spangled Banner of the United States of America. A tough pill to swallow for the southern people to belong to a country they didn't like. Sadness and disapproval were read on every face. A period of austerity was starting. Many wild and loose women came to the West. I'll arrange it, Vince. First buy a big house far out of the town. Farm is a good place. It's easy. Plenty of girls working. Fast dollars will roll in. Listen, big ideas can fix us great. Lots of girls, liquor, and sex. The style of the country changed. Often honest Californians were replaced by unscrupulous men who did anything for money. They lived by the gun and made their own laws. They had no sense of right or wrong. Life was cheap and anything was OK as long as they got the dollar. Card shops, gamblers, confidence men came to California. Nuts! What I say goes. Bring the girls by coach. It's me what's the deputy. I make the laws. You men make the women behave or beat the hell out them. - OK, Deputy. - Shut up. Let's go. Told you them women are trouble. We've got work to do. Let's not keep the girls waiting. Everybody ignored the existence of The Golden Saloon. Nobody knew about the location of that terrible place where they brought the respectable girls. There they would become less respectable. Give me a whiskey. Right. There, thanks. What do you want, Mister? Fun. Oh, here you got plenty, but you got to pay. How much? OK, OK, how much? OK, I don't know. It depends. That's a lot of money. Well. I give you $2.10. Oh, big spender, and big talker. Bang. Hope they are good. Hey, you. Come here. Not much. Gosh. I can't shoot straight. The gun is lousy. First you put your scotch at the end to fire, then you cook it in a pot. You serve very hot. You'll see. It's delicious. Why a side dish? You put what you like. Pass me a smoke. Another? They pretty lousy cigarettes. Hm. Get your own next time. Bad cigarettes. Think they're stealing your house. God damn it! Don't break your neck. I tell you, the boss is going to hit the roof. Come in. You talk first. Go ahead. What's going on? And what's bothering you? The girl from room three. The bitch, she stole my horse. She's got brains. My God, thought you'd holler at us. Mm-hmm. Bop bop bop bop bop bop. Perfect. You better get that girl by tomorrow or else you know what'll happen. No, no, no, no. Chief, for Christ's sake I'll find that girl. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. OK, you girly, get back to your work. I ain't got all day. What I need now is a little rest. Stealing horses is no work for a sweet girl like me. Attention! These unscrupulous men kidnapped all sorts of girls, mostly from the East. They looked them over like cattle. Any girl who didn't cooperate was beaten and whipped. Either she worked in the saloon or she was sold to the Indians. Or she was never heard from again. Hey, look! There's the horse. Then Lulu must be around somewhere. Shh! No noise. There she is. She's not bad looking. Let me go! We got you, you bitch! No! No! You're going to pay for stealing my horse. No, stop it! Help! Catch her! Now I gotcha. No, no! Oh, stop! No! Let me go! Oh, you pigs! Leave her alone! Who is that guy? Oh, make them stop! What the hell are you doing? But I was doing nothing. I was playing. - You creep! Beat it! You rat! Come on! You're drunk. I hate you! Here you are. Here's your blouse. Thanks a lot, Mister. But who are you? Richard. Richard the Great. But why you fooling around, hey? It's a long story. One day I was bringing a jar of honey to my mother's house, but-- Hey. Where you going, honey? What you got in the basket, honey? My mother don't let me talk to strangers. Let a man walk you. Leave my basket alone, you sissy! Hey, bitch! Gotta get some of that honey. Oh, no, stop! And then what happened? Those two beasts dragged me to this stinking place, bullied me. A sex school place for training lots of girls to be slaves. Stinky, huh? Oh! Where you taking me? Let me go! Monsters! Come on. All right. Let's go. Get in. Go on, get in. Who's she? Who do you think you are? What is this? Get in there. Sit still. Get up there. Let's go. Hurry up. Get inside, you girls. Come on. Take it easy. Lousy girls. Come on. Come on. Get moving. Close the door. Hello! I got a new bunch of girls here for you. Got a rush. Another load coming. Don't you fool around with them, either. Oh, think yourself, you bastard. Let's see what you got there. OK. Look it. OK, girls. Move it. Let's see something very nice. Mm-mm. Dirty slob. You're not too bad. Take you for myself. Nice figure, good big bottom. Just right. Come on my pretty thing. Good. Nice. What you girls need is a good clean bath. Plenty of hot water and soap. The girls were being prepared for their new life of work in the saloon. They were given hot baths, new clothes and were unaware of what was planned for them. OK, girls. Get undressed and wash up. There's plenty of hot water. You can hang your dresses on the hooks. You got nice soft skin. Who are you? What are we doing here? I'm your new boss. What's going on? Wash. Come on, girls. The Chief's anxious to see you. Help me. Nice. Very nice. Not a bad bunch. Not bad at all. That's nice. I'm afraid of boys. I'm a virgin. I'm one, also. That cow looks at us like freaks. Hope we can run away. Me, too. Oh! Oh my. Ooh, it's got all sudsy and fine. Come on now, use some soap. What you doing? Come wash my back. Oh, come on. Looks like your first bath in a year. Beautiful. You don't look so innocent. And never mind the jokes you girls. Just wash up, no manners. You'll see soon enough, you'll get to see the chief. Got the new girls ready. Mm-hmm? Finally very clean, very nice. Ready to see them? Yeah, all right. OK, ladies get in here. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hm. Mm-hm. OK, now. Let's see, not bad, fine. You're OK, ladies. First I'd like to tell you, behave yourselves and follow orders, you'll be well-treated and eat well. Nice clothes, lots of fun. But if you make any trouble, we're going to punish you severely. Now for the training. Now please pay attention. This picture presents the tales about sex. Bodies of men react. Sam here is a-- Huh? Go on, go ahead. Shh. You hear that? They're over there. Let's go, quick. You go that way. Very still. Very quiet now. Someone behind. You go around here, and over there. No, no! Go. Hey, hey. Where are you going? Fast, fast, they're coming! Yo, they're here! I found this. You stupid idiot! What do I need this? Go find them. Mmm! It's a nice house, very nice. Mm. Mm. Yeah, I got to snoop in the Golden Saloon. But it'll be plenty bit hard. Who can I trust? First you got to be careful in there. Ask around the bar for Sally. She'll be able to trust. Much thanks. So long now. Want some? Good looking? I'd like to buy Sally a drink. Best broad in town for my money. How much to play? Make good and plenty? I've got plenty dough. Oh, Sally's very, very busy now. But I think I could certainly be free. More versatile and interesting, since I got a lot of training. How'd you like to fool around? It's only half the cost? I like your style. It'll be very good, you know? Let's go. Well, thanks. I'd only like Sally. Sorry there buddy, but Sally and me got an appointment. I got time, I'm all right. But I intend to see Sally tonight. Come on, Sally. It's no emergency. No rush. Well you, you can get into a card game. Hey, for you, I wouldn't judge anything. No thanks, you're not my style. I know a man who's hot for big girls. In that case, the vinyl's only for the girls to sit on. You go in there and play win dough, good poker action, good luck in there. Good idea. I think I'll be lucky. How about a game? Better be good to Sally. I like her. She's waiting in her room. Oh, she's tired. I'll handle it OK. See you around. Come in. Hi I'm-- Lulu sent me here. I'm Big Richard. Sally, I've got to talk to you. It's a delicate situation. Shh. We can't speak because there's spies listening at the walls. I got to get a way to catch up. The big guy. It's the lousy mayor. He's the big man who makes money from us. He brings us here and makes us do many bad things. It's a lousy rotten prison here. We need help. He's not very good to folk here. This saloon-- well, they should close it. I'll try to help. Maybe. But I'm sure it's the guy who chased us. I bet it's him. He went upstairs. We'll have a look-see. Let's look around for that bum. He's gotta be here someplace. Come on, baby. I got lots of dough. I like you, honey. You're cute. You must've paid a lot of money for a trio. Let's go to bed. Well, something has to be done. The situation is really getting out of hand. It's lousy. We all agree, judge. What do you suggest is the course of action that should ease the situation? And do you got any ideas, sir? I don't know. Although I'll think of something. I don't know. It's just terrible. Our daughter disappeared. The women, well, they vanish. We tried our best to get along. We want to live in harmony, but what can we do? I don't know. The other day, the Rodriguez daughter never came home after marketing. Does anyone here have a suggestion? Let's call the army. Are you kidding? That's no good. So it's-- That could run-- No joke, the best move. You don't know anything, young idiot jerk. You're unreasonable. I still agree, we can call the army. We always settle our disagreements among ourselves. There's no reason. There's very good reasons. I can't tell you. Very good. I'll be back later, believe me. Ladies. Papa! I tell you, my decision's best, not to be hasty, no army. We can arrange a situation ourselves. I'm the magistrate, my mind is made up, people. That's it. Don't be a dope. Don't rush off, because we'll think it out. This whole lousy situation needs action, not discussion. Come on. Where the hell are you going? I'll try to catch them. I'll go through the kitchen. Don't do it. After all, it's our fault. He may be right anyway. What can we do? No kidding. I'm really angry. I'll show these idiots what I'll do. You'll see. Let's talk it over. We can't handle it ourselves. It's too hard. No, I won't! They can't organize anything. I'll do it my way, that's all. I'm the magistrate. You mind your own business and get on that wagon, understand? I guess you're right, Daddy. Ho. Hey, you sure there's a little wagon path here? Yeah, yeah. Stay down, be careful. Better be quiet. Tomorrow we're gonna get gold, and then we'll get a little action. You betcha. I'd like some big flower now. Yeah, a gal's who's got class, with big blue eyes, and doesn't stink. Ah. Are you girls OK back there? No. Now Sabine wants to get up. Personal matter, you know? OK, but hurry up. Whoa, boy, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, which girl's to go? We ain't got time. Hurry up, there. Vroom, vroom, look at that beauty. Yeah. Oh, look at that gorgeous girl, eh? Whoosh. Who are you sissies? Come on, with us. Are you going to save me? Yeah, we're going to save you, all right. Yeah. Yeah, we're going to save you girl, come on. Where the hell is that beauty? The wolves will get her. She ran away, I guess. You try to catch her. I'll fix all you girls. Get out there, get out. Take off your clothes. And this time, nobody will beat it. Hurry. Hurry, be quick. I'll teach you to run away. Come on, you girls, get in there. I couldn't find her. Well, we'll find her tomorrow. The wolves will get her. Let her go. Let's get going. Come here, honey. Look at that. What you got in there, baby? Oh. Oh, look at that girl. I like that. You're bad. You're taking advantage of me. Hey, hold it. I'd like some. I'm just as horny as you. We'll roll the dice and see. Hey, stop touching her. Roll the dice. Yeah. It's me, I win. Oh, I'm going to get you, honey. I like that one. Oh. Yeah, get that away. Girl, you're going to have a good time, girl. You'll like me, honey. Uh. Uh. I'll put this here for you. Yeah. That's nice and comfy for you. Oh. Oh. Ah, yeah. Ah! Oh, you're not. Oh! Rotten luck, Don, that Bill got caught. That might cause us some trouble. The idiot. I'll take care of it. You got no right. No, I'll get you for this. Who are you trying to kid? We got you red-handed. The judge says to hold it. This prisoner must go to trial before a civil court. He ain't no soldier. That's the judge's orders. OK, well, I'm sorry. You were only proceeded to your orders. Fine job. Don't worry, that guy will stand trial, thanks. Let's go, OK. Ha, imagine that, being caught by a soldier boy, that big idiot. Just because they've got girls in the wagon. Jerks. Don't laugh too loud. People are looking. And be sure to make a good trial, so be cautious. That Bill's an idiot. You need anyhow, you'll see to it that he gets a real good trial, and all will go according to plans. Handle it right. I'll get him a good trial, all right. Can't let this incident ruin the saloon. No sir. Lots of dough around. These hicks don't know anything. Don't worry about her, I'll handle it. I don't worry about it. I's the judge. And what I say goes. The District Court of California is now in session. Judge Senate presiding. All rise. Quiet in the courtroom. Today is a really proud period in this state. We're going to hold a trial. Dispensing peace and justice means law and order equally for all men. And be quiet, be seated. OK, the first case. The man was caught with a wagon load of beautiful women, right? Easy to explain, very easy. My client is innocent. He did nothing wrong. He's a good guy. You sure? Tell us about it? Who are these girls? Well, they are just tourists. They all came to breathe good California air, that's all. Yeah? What's the first welcome? Being arrested by soldiers, very shocking. Bill here did nothing. Well, I heard these girls were naked. No clothes at all. But always be caught. It was a hot day and they couldn't find no place to swim. You think this court's gonna believe that phony story? But sir, please believe it's true. The behavior of tourists is strange anyhow. Story's quite true. I was riding my horse, and I'm just going along, minding nothing. And I see this big wagon rolling along, and the driver was an old buddy of mine. He said I could ride along with him. I was most glad to ride along, and talk to him. I was going to visit my mother. Well, your story sounds quite true, but hitchhiking's illegal. We don't cotton to that, and you got to go to jail. We can't let you get away with breaking the law of no hitchhiking, see? We've got to show these citizens we got justice and law. Please, please let's go. I can't bear it, it's a farce. No, let's see how far he goes. But that judge is a phony. He doesn't fool me. Hold on, let's see what's next. Settle down, quiet. I won't have this court made noise and disrespectful. I'll clear you all out, shut up! Bill, will you tell the court in a very honest way, perhaps we may understand, anything more you may know in this case? The town knows your reputation, and you're innocent. Tell us, Will. Yes, sir, yes. That's good enough. I believe you. You did nothing wrong. Course. Well, OK. I say you are only guilty of hitchhiking on the road. And that is again the law. So $2 or two days. Now do people see how fair that is? What about them innocent girls? Order, order in the court. You dumb woman. You sit down over there. It's not easy to be a judge. You're not liked by everyone. I try to be fair and honest. I work hard. I donate to charity. I like kids and dogs. You've got to understand my side. You people don't know nothing. Shut up. Bill here was gone to see his sick mother, and he just accidentally hitchhiked with an old friend in the tourist business. The Court of California sees that. It's often that justice is blind. However, in this case, it seems clear enough. Bill is innocent. He's kind of very nice. He's got good grades in school, but folks all know that. I'm returning his gun back. That's my decision. In this law book, I see the rules plain and clear. It is $2 fine or two days. I only go by the law. Nobody may say otherwise. I's the judge and I's knows what's good and right. Outrageously liar! Cheater! Thief! Cheap, lying scandal! Big liar, cheating crook, bad money hungry cheat! Hey, Sergeant, in here! Hurry! Hang the judge! Shoot the first person that makes trouble. Clear the courthouse now. OK, all of you out. The judge says all of you out in the street. Clear out! Get out of here! They're stronger than us. Better be going now. - Coward. Afraid. Impossible. Country. Phony liar. You're in this too. Everyone, everyone knows your phony situation in this-- I'll bet you're just making thousands. Huh. The crowd really got out of hand. Many of them made threats on Your Excellency. It's serious. It's essential that the leaders have gotten rid of. I don't know, there's a chance it's an organized group. That Paulette gal, she's a danger. I think she's organizing others. She's very unpredictable. She may find a lot of supporters. That's bad. I hear she's got lots of folks in the town that will join her. She's dangerous. We've got to get her. And arrest her, she and Richard. No question, those two, we should arrest them. You're right. Hmm. It's very clear. First you'll quit the organization. My decision on that is certain. Then you'll send a note to the judge saying you are sincerely sorry. Oh, but please listen. If we don't take action now, all is lost, done. The mayor may fool many. No, I don't care to be associated in the entire situation. You will do as I say, and let's not discuss it again. You're an educated girl, and should not join these things. Clear out, we're raiding this joint. What is this? Who are you? I'm here because Paulette and the others are agitators, they are. You've got no right to-- I got all the rights. Funny you're here too. Does look bad. I was only here to deliver a letter to Paulette, judge. I'm not part of anything. From who? Let's see it. No, don't! Oh. Mm. Mm. If we find proof in the house that you got an organization here, you're going to go to jail. Search the house, all over the place. OK, judge. Come on, boys. All right, I'll look all around upstairs. I'm gonna check the downstairs. All right, look all around. Sorry, Lady. You'll regret your actions if I-- Can I go now, Mister? I don't got nothing to do with it. Mm. Hold it now. Did you ever bring other letters here like this? No, I go now. I hope you are not hiding any lips or letters here and you're innocent. Because otherwise, you're going to jail. You got maybe something to hide ladies? But there is no basis in your charges. You're very wrong. And I won't hold bad memories. My mind has a nature to forget. But now if the guards find you women organizing agitators and don't trust me, then you'll see the inside of the jail. Nice, nice. It'll be sad to take this nice glass, and the many nice things here, I have set fire and waste it. But we'll do it. Ah ha ha. Ah, ah, girls. Who are you? Ah. What do you want? Get out of here! I said, get out of here! Leave us alone. Nice. Hey, look at that. Hey, I want some of that. Ah! Hey, come on. Leave me alone! Come on. Hey look, lots of letters here. You don't! Those are personal letters. You've got things to hide, maybe? Go ahead, search again. I seen this organization filth before in town. You lousy-- you have no facts. Facts? I have all the facts on this paper, and you will just find me lenient. I'll be the most liberal if Paulette confesses. Your organization is really-- My daughter can join any club she likes. It's not illegal. I'm certain of that. I know these organizations. They stir the town and cause riots. You know that. Ah! And take this! Get over there, come on. Ah! What are you doing? Ah! Ah. Look what she did to you. Oh. Now you're going to get it, honey. Leave me alone. You're really going to get it for doing that now, baby. Oh, you're cute. Hey. That's the-- hey, what are you doing? Get that stuff off me. Are you crazy, woman? Oh, you jerk. What's wrong with you? Oh. I'm all that stuff. And take this. Hey, what's going on? Who's shooting? I can get killed. We didn't shoot. Come on, you guys! All right, if Richard begins-- You'll never get Richard. You come here, or I'll shoot you. He's afraid, mama. Don't go. Now, be good and walk fast. I'll not miss again. I should kill you right here, you rat. Defend yourself. If you think that I'm a idiot, I'll call the men. Be still. Don't ruin the rock. Are you crazy, the rock? I'll see to it that this creep doesn't bother you. If I shoot a third time, you're a dead man. I give you warning, you thief. Leave Paulette and her organization alone. Decent people have a right to live. I intend to clean up this town and make it a nice place to have kids. You shouldn't keep any evidence in the house. You'd better go on now. Have faith and courage. I will save the girls at the Golden Saloon. I'm Richard the Great, remember that. Good bye! Hey, stop! What was that? You go and take that side. You go the other side. Right, OK. Got me. After you guys go to the right, the others go that way. Hey, let's go, come on. Get them, wow, let's go, yeah, let's go. You have nice eyes. Kiss me, please. Mm. Come on, this way. Yeah, OK. Let's sleep now, huh? I usually read a little. Makes it relaxing, and then I fall asleep. You're a strange guy, but you're pleasant. Strange? I don't think so. I'm honest and dependable. You're nice, and I bet many girls chase you. Oh, I must go somewhere. It's a very pressing errand. I'm sorry to leave you now, but it's very important. I may not be back in time for lunch or dinner, so don't wait. I'll be back in touch as soon as I can, promise. That's how it usually starts. You're all alike. Oh, you naughty man. She'll be coming round. Hey, did you hear this one? The girl, the girl got this cowboy in the bath, and not only forgot to take his boots off, but the mother of the girl made the two get hitched! Richard. What do you want? Just calling to tell you cowboys I'm going to clean up this bad saloon here. Be warned, this place ain't going to be in business much longer. I promise. Oh yeah? I'm not about to start shaking because you come here. Look, smart guy. You tell your boss I know what's really going on in this Golden Saloon, and I intend to teach you bums a lesson. That should teach you a big lesson. Now anyone else needs teaching? You big idiot! I'm going to break you in two! I ain't kidding around, you guys are going to be getting out of town, or else, I, Richard, am personally going to wallop you. Big shot, eh? You and who else? You make a big noise, but don't scare no one. You want trouble, I'll give it. He's dead. He's done for. You should go and rest. Later. I'd like to sit here a little longer. Such a rotten, hard, lousy day. You look tired. Are you? A little. You don't look good, either. I know what you're thinking. It's Richard. You're interested in that Richard, aren't you? Well, look, I know his kind. Good looking, tall, sweet talking the ladies. I warn you, he is a run-around. That kind doesn't settle down with one girl. They like to stay loose, understand? I don't care what you say. I'd do anything to see Richard again. He's got everything. No use talking. As a mother I will just suffer. You just like suffering. I know that. Good night, honey. Richard. It's very-- I couldn't resist you, so I came in. I-- But you'd better go. I need you. You've got to help me. It's dangerous to be here. The men are outside. I know, my darling, but you've got to give me-- me the names of the people in your organization I love you. Oh, I'd be happy to surrender the list of names to you. We'll close the saloon. Oh, that's a lot to do. Can you stay here an hour? I'd like to kiss my big Richard. Of course, I know how irresistible I am. Phooey, you've been gone most of the morning. Afraid of me? Don't ask what I've been through. I'm back now, so we can sleep a little longer. The lousy rat. But who is this guy Richard? Tell me all about him. He shoots good? Who is he? I don't know, but I'm sure he's a fast gun. A big face mask and all in black. Very dangerous. I bet he's a paid gun. Best to kill him soon. You say he's fast, huh, fast? That's the truth. Let's still be cautious, because he might know a great deal, huh? We've got to tell the guards he's fast on the gun. This Richard could ruin us, I tell you. Maybe we could get about Sabata to kill him. He might just know about the Golden Saloon. I'm not taking any chances. Have any of the boys seen Richard and Sabata? Tell him to arrange a trap, and ask around who he really is, OK? It's not so easy. Yes, yes, I want that big rat taken care of, and I'm plenty serious. You go and make sure. Yes, sir. He needs to learn a lesson. Do the others know this Richard? No, he's masked, but maybe the big fool shoot up saloon. But so, so he's-- he's mad, he shoot on sight. I'll see to that. That's a good idea, do it. Kill Richard. To be killed, see? I was only afraid he could have told others in the town already, that's all. Very big chance, chance of that. He might get many others to close down, fast action, very fast. You're right, the guards at that saloon should shoot on sight. I don't like this whole thing. There's a lot at stake. You go and take care of the details. Steady. You were gone so long, Richard. Shh. Sorry honey, I had lots to do. Good news though, I've gotten others to help. Well, enter. Morning sir, got a second? What do you want? This is a grievance list. It's a laugh. Increased money, ha, association of girl's rights. These demands are very unreasonable. But girls in Texas get a good $40 more than us, and you don't give us a dime for our work. Most of the girls insist on a fairly large amount of cash, or else we'll stop working. Big amount of money, honey. Put that in your hat, you lousy rat. You don't scare me with your list. I'm the boss, and you girls will work as usual, see? Times are changing, realize that. You're afraid of us, huh? I strongly suggest you give us a salary. I'll give you two seconds to apologize and get out, or I'll have you tortured, see. I'm sorry. Please, sir, I'm sorry. OK, get out, get out, don't bother me again. Money, ridiculous. Phooey, $40. Vacation, and allowance money for buying medicine. Clean sheets each Tuesday night. Fresh supply of deodorant on Mondays. Ah, this lousy list. They get nothing. Move it this way. Just fine like this. Come on, hurry. You get over there. You girls go there. Hurry. Come on, they're coming! Hold it where you are. Stop those horses, get down, you two, and reach for the sky. First have them undress. Off, be quick, you. I'll get the girls. Yeah, hi ho silver. Oh. That's all right, honey. Oh, it's so great to be free. Come on, ma'am. Pleasure, ma'am. No problem. We're saved, thank goodness. Hurry up. My pleasure, ma'am. Thank you. I don't mind. All right. We're saved. Oh, I'm so happy. Come on, don't push. Come on, girls, hurry, get in. Please, hurry. What about me? You can't leave me like this. We're going, we're going. Let's go fast to the Golden Saloon. Please hurry. Hey, I'm cold. Don't leave me like this. Bye bye there. Hey, wait for me. Stop! Hey, stop! It's not safe in these woods. I could get robbed by bandits. Wait for me. You rats. Hey, come on, stop. I didn't realize just how terrible I'd become. Oh no. You ninny, get out. Yes sir, OK. I have to repair this awful thing I have did just to get rich. I'll lead the people in a revolt. I'll give them guns, and we'll close the saloon. But they're too strong. You'll be a big shot hero, but I-- we don't no cash. Just run away! OK, you girls hurry. Get in there. Darling will look you over. Come on, hurry up, move along or I'll beat you. You silly girls. Shut that door. A lot of beauties here. Yeah, yeah, I know. You'll get paid. You new here? The other guy got sick, so I took the girls. Now they're your problem. OK, girls. Let's see how you are. Not bad. You ladies get a bath now. Go ahead, hurry. It's too hot. Oh, take baths. Here's a towel. To clean things. Help yourself. Now hurry up, girls, be quick. Wash up good. Hey, you're not bad looking, you. Go in the water already, so dirty. Get your lousy hands off me.

Wait, wait here. Stop. On to victory. Half you men go to the right now. You others, follow me. You go to the rear of the saloon. We'll take the entrance. - Right, good luck. Go. Move. Wa hoo! Mr. Sabata, Mr. Sabata! What is it? What's the matter there? There's a bunch of our men outside. I gotta move. You fat pig! Stop screaming or I'll kill you! Get into the water! Let me go! Come on, into the water. No! Stop it, stop it! Oh! No! Let go of me! Let go of me! OK, you men, you go out there and shoot it out. I don't care how many of them there are. Shoot it out to the very end. The girls are depending on you. Let's teach that big bitch a lesson. You cad, you've ruined the last dancing girl's life. You'll spend a hundred years in jail. Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to jail she'll go. That big fat cow is through right now, hi ho, hi ho, hi ho, hi ho. Hi ho, it's off to jail she goes. Let's not waste time.

Hey you, upstairs, girls, ladies! But what's happening there? The Women's Freedom Organization's taking over. You're all free. Go get guns. From now on, you get paid for your work. Woman unite, come. Your bodies are not mere playthings. We'll show those pigs that us ladies here are equals, not just sex things. Right girls, join us. Join us. Listen to me, men are bums. Sabata's through. Bring your guns. We're all behind you. Most of us can shoot pistols. I can shoot a cannon, though I'm a bit rusty. Take this. Here, you give out guns to the others, and don't forget bullets too. Right. The others are ready. We'll shoot anyone or anything that makes a sound. And shoot straight. Let's go on to battle. Kill them! Woo! Careful now! Come on, let's go. Get him! Get that guy on the roof. Ah! Get him. Come on, let's go. Quick, load this one, hurry. Finally, they're here. Help is here. We're going to be OK. There are hundreds out there, and it's going great. Oh, Richard. It's great, it's OK. You should see Sabata run. They'll put him in jail. Richard the Great, our hero. Hooray! Richard the Great. Girls, take it easy. One at a time. I'll kill you all. Oh. Easy, girl. Oh. Hey, leave some for me. Get away. It's my turn. Ah, come over, darling. Let's see what makes Richard so great. Mm. My hero. Oh, he is great. You can see that. Our hero. Hey, I'd like some of that action. Hey, Richard. How about a little Dolly? Oh no, not Dolly. Get her off me. She'll kill me. Help! No, no, no. Oh, I like you, Richard. No, no, no.
