You?re for Indian Island, maybe? Take me with you. Irina TERESHCHENKO as Ethel Rogers Alexei ZOLOTNITSKY as Thomas Rogers in TEN LITTLE INDIANS Based on the novel by Agatha Christie Directed by Stanislav GOVORUKHIN Director of Photography Gennady ENGSTREM Production Designer Valentin GIDULYANOV Music by Nikolai KORNDORF English subtitles by Boris BULGAKOV and Zora K. Must be difficult to land here in dirty weather. Can?t land on Island when there?s a southeasterly. Sometimes this cut off for a week or more. My name is Lombard, Philip Lombard. You may call me Captain Lombard. - Vera Claythorne. - Do you know this part of the world well? No, never before. I haven?t ever seen my employer yet. - Your employer? - Yes, I?m Mrs. Owen?s secretary. - Isn?t that rather unusual? - Oh, no. I don?t think so. Her own secretary was suddenly taken ill and she wired to an agency for substitute and they sent me. - And suppose you don?t like it? - So what? It?s only temporary - a holiday post. I?ve got a permanent job at a girls' school. At a matter of fact frightfully thrilled at the prospect of seeing Indian Island. There?s been such a lot about it in the papers. At first, they were saying that some kind of American movie star bought it. After that - millionaire Owen. What are they like? Tell me, please. Good evening, gentlemen. Mr. Owen unfortunately delayed unable to get here till tomorrow. - Good start. Instruction - everything they wanted - if they would like to go to their rooms? - Dinner would be at 8 o?clock. - It?s late. The house with insects. It?s true. Really. - It?s impossible, Miss Brent. - Everybody says that and then nothing can be done. Let me help you. Sorry sir, your room upstairs. This way, please. I hope you?ve got everything you want, Miss? I?m Mrs. Owen?s new secretary. I expect you know that. No, Miss. I don?t know anything. Just a list of the ladies and gentlemen and what rooms they were to have. Mrs. Owen didn?t mention me? I haven?t seen Mrs. Owen not yet. We only came 2 days ago. May I go? Ten little Indian boys went out to dine... Ten little Indian boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little Indian boys sat up very late; ...sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little Indian boys travelling in Devon; One said he'd stay there and then there were seven. 10 minutes ago I regretted that I came here. - Quaint these things, aren?t they? - Yes, they are. - How many are there? - Ten there are. One, two, three? Possibly they are in order. This one is a chief. They?re 10 little Indian boys of the nursery rhyme. In my bedroom the rhyme is hung up over mantelpiece. - In mine. - In mine too. - In mine. - In my room too. I think the owner must be going through his second childhood. Doctor, d?you know Constance Culmington? I?m afraid, I don?t. It?s of no consequence. Very vague woman - and practically unreadable handwriting. I was just wondering if I?d come to the wrong place. I had the same thought. Mrs. Oliver has been lucky to get this servant. Oliver? Did you say Oliver? - Yes. - Mrs. Owen. - I?ve never met any one called Owen. - Ladies and gentlemen! Silence, please! You are charged with the following indictments. Doctor Armstrong, that you did upon the 14th day of March, '29, cause the death of Mary Clees. Emily Brent, that upon the 5th of November, '31, you were responsible for the death of Beatrice Taylor. William Blore, that you brought about the death, of James Landor on October 5th, '28. Vera Elizabeth Claythorne, that on the 11th day of August, '35, killed Cyril Hamilton. Captain Lombard, that upon a date in February, '32, you were guilty of the death of 20 men, members of an East African tribe. General Macarthur, you deliberately sent your wife's lover, Arthur Richmond, to his death. Anthony Marston, were guilty of the murder of John and Lucy Combes! Ethel and Thomas Rogers, you brought about the death of Jennifer Brady. Lawrence Wargrave, that upon the 10th day of June, '30, you were guilty of the murder of Edward Seton. Prisoners, have you anything to say in your defence? Doctor, quick! It?s nothing. She?s fainted, that?s all. Rogers, water! Help, please! Put her here. What?s happened to me? Just one sip, you?ll feel better. What a horrible voice. Where have I heard that voice? What?s going on here? What kind of practical joke was that? Ah, here we are. What? Ladies and gentlemen! Silence, please! Turn it off! Turn it off! That?s just nerves. Now Mrs. Rogers will be better. She?s fainted, that?s all. Because of the voice. What a horrible voice. It sounded like a sentence. I have to make a statement, gentlemen, it?s a heinous lie from start to end. - A disgraceful and heartless practical joke. - So you think it?s a joke, do you? There?s one thing you?ve forgotten. - Who the devil turned the thing on and set it going? - Rogers? Yes, Sir? Who put the record on the gramophone? Wasn?t you, Rogers? I didn?t know what it was. Before God, I didn?t know, sir. That is probably true. But I think you?d better explain. - I was just obeying orders, sir. - Whose orders? Mr. Owen?s. I was to start the gramophone, after I?d gone with the coffee tray. - A very remarkable story. - I didn?t know what it was. I swear to God, it had a name on it, I thought it was just a piece of music. Was there a title on it? Quite right, Sir. It was titled ?Swan Song?. The whole thing is preposterous! Slinging accusation about like this! - This fellow Owen whoever he is? - That?s just it, who is he? Now then we must get to the bottom of this. Rogers! Yes, Sir? - Who is this Mr. Owen? - He owns this place, Sir. We are aware of the fact, Rogers. What do you yourself know about the man? I can?t say, Sir. You see, I?ve never seen him. You?ve never seen him? What d?yer mean? My wife and I were engaged by letter through an agency. The ?Regina? Agency. Old established firm. We are to arrive on a certain day. Everything was in order. Just needed dusting and that. And then yesterday I got another letter from Mr. Owen. It said he was detained and to do the best we could? - To do the best! - And gave the instruction about dinner and gramophone plate. - Surely you?ve got that letter? - Yes, sir. Here you are. Headed Ritz Hotel and typewritten. - If you?ll just let me have a look. ?Coronation? machine. Quite new - no defects. Ensign paper. ?U.N. Owen?. Got some fancy Christian names, hasn?t he? Ulick Norman Owen. Quite a mouthful. There?s something very peculiar about of this. I received a letter with a signature that was not easy to read. It purported to be from Mrs. Oliver I had met at a summer resort 2 years ago. She invited me to this Island where, supposedly, opened a pension with a good cuisine and without the newfangled fashions: half-naked youth and music until morning. - You have that letter, Miss Brent. - Yes, I will fetch it for you. Please, stay here. Marston? What? Got a wire. From a pal of mine, because I had an idea he had gone to Norway. Told me to roll up here. That?s all. General? Got a letter from this fellow Owen mentioned some old pals of mine who were to be here. Letter? Haven?t kept the letter. I?m afraid. I was invited as a doctor. From the letter I understood that the husband was worried about his wife. He wants to find out her health condition, but so as not to disturb her. She refuses to see a doctor. Nerves, you know. - There was a check in the letter. - I see. You had no previous acquaintanceship with the family? No. A colleague of mine was mentioned in the letter. To give verisimilitude? And that colleague, I presume, was momentarily out of touch with you. Yes. At the moment I am interested in a minor point. Amongst the names recited was that of William Blore. But there is no one named Blore amongst us. The name of Davis was not mentioned. What have you to say about that, Mr. Davis? Mister Davis? What? Cat?s out of the bag, it seems. I?d better admit that my name isn?t Davis. - You are William Blore? - That?s right. Not only are you here under a false name but in addition you?re a first-class liar. You claim to have come from Natal, South Africa. I?m prepared to swear you?ve never been there. - Now then, any expectation? - You gentlemen have got me wrong. I?ve got my credentials. I?m ex- C.I.D. man of Scotland Yard. - I was put on this job. - By whome? This man Owen. Enclosed a handsome money order. I was posing as a guest and keep weather eye open. I was given all your names. - Any reason given? - Of course! Mrs. Owen?s jewels - plague take ?em! Sweet company! There is nothing to say. And I, an old bird was caught with chaff! To my mind, Mrs.Owen does not exist at all! Your conclusions are, I think, justified. The letters we got were bearing the signature "U.N.Owen" - "Unowen", that's to say - anonym. - But this is fantastic-mad! - Oh, yes. You are right. I?ve no doubt in my own mind that we have been invited here by a madman - probably a dangerous homicidal lunatic. Whoever it was who enticed us here, that person has taken the trouble to find out a good deal about us all. - A pack of damn lie! - It?s iniquitous! A lie? a wicked lie? We never did - neither of us. Our unknown friend accuses me of the murder of one Edward Seton. He was charged with the murder of an eldery woman. He made a good impression on the jury. Somebody thought that not doubt of the verdict and acquittal practically certain. Nevertheless, on the evidence, he was certainly guilty. I summed up accordingly, and the jury brought in a verdict of guilty. I wish to say that my conscience in perfectly clear on the matter. I did my duty and nothing more. Did you know Seton at all? I mean previous to the case. I knew? ?nothing of Seton? ?previous to the case. I?d like to tell you about that boy. I was nursery governess for him. We lived by the sea. He was forbidden to swim out far. One day, when my attention was distracted, he started off. I swam after him? I couldn?t get there in time? It was awful? But it wasn?t my fault. At the inquest the investigator exonerated me. And his mother - she was so kind. I don?t know, why should this awful thing he said? - It?s not fair. - Don't worry, my dear. Of course it?s not true. It?s lie? Fellow?s a madman. A madman! Got a bee in his bonnet! Best really to leave this sort of thing unanswered. However, feel I ought to say - no truth whatever in what he said about young Arthur Richmond. Richmond was one of my officers. I sent him on a reconnaissance. He was killed. Natural course of events in war time. Wish to say resent very much ? slur on my wife. Best woman in the world. - About those natives? - Yes, what about them? Story?s quite true! I left ?em! Matter of self-preservation. I and a couple of fellows what food there was and cleared out. Shame on you! You are an officer. You abandoned your men - left them to starve? Not quite the act of a pukka sahib, I?m afraid. But self-preservation a man?s first duty. And natives don?t mind dying, you know, as Europeans do. - Oh my God! - You left them to die? Yes, indeed. Why are you looking at me like that? I don?t understand anything at all. I killed John and Lucy Combes! I killed!.. Absurd! Delusion! I killed... That's right... Must have been a couple of kids I ran over near Cambridge. - Beastly bad luck. - For them, or for you? It was a pure accident. By the way, I had my license endorsed for a year. This speeding?s all wrong! Young men like you are a danger to the community. Speed?s come to stay. I'm sorry. Are you waiting for me to say something? - I have nothing to say. - Nothing, Miss Brent? Nothing. You reserve your defence? There is no questions of defence. I have always acted in accordance with my dictates of my conscience. I have nothing with which to reproach myself. What about yourself, Mr. Bloor? What about me? Your name was included in the list. Ah! Landor, you mean? I remember? Landor was convicted on your evidence. He got penal servitude for life and died in Dartmoor a year later. - He was a delicate man. - He was a crook. You were complimented, I think, on your able hanging of the case. I got my promotion. I was only doing my duty. What a duty-loving, law-abiding lot we all seem to be! Myself excepted, of course. What about you, doctor - and your little professional mistake? Illegal operation, was it? I?m at a loss to understand the matter. The name meant nothing to me when it was spoken. What was it - Clees? Close? I really can?t remember having a patient of that name. It might possibly be one of my operation cases in hospital. Yes, they come too late, so many of these people. Then, when the patient dies, they always consider it?s the surgeon?s fault. I, too, used to find myself in such situations. If I might just say a word, gentlemen. - Go ahead, Rogers. - There was a mention of me and Mrs. Rogers. And of Miss Brady... We started working for Ms. Brady when she had already been ill. There was a storm, sir, that night she was taken bad. The telephone was out of order. We couldn?t get the doctor for her. I went for him on foot. But he get there too late. We?d done everything possible for her. Devoted to her, we were. Any one will tell you the same. Come into a little something at her death, though? Eh? Miss Brady left us a legacy in recognition of our faithful services. And why not, I?d like to know? Our inquiry rest there. - Now, Rogers,.. - Yes, Sir? ?who else is there on this island besides you and your wife? Nobody at all, Sir. - Are you sure of that? - Quite sure, Sir. I suggest that we leave tonight. - But there?s no boat on the island. - No boat at all? - No, sir. - How do you communicate with the mainland? The boat comes over every morning, sir. It brings the bread and the milk and the post. Well, I?ll leave tomorrow morning. - Yes, you are right. - Ought to ferret out the mystery before we go. The whole thing's like a detective story. We have to figure it out. A stranger challenged us. I am ready to take it up. He?s dead. D?you mean the fellow just choked and died? In the midst of life we are in death. Poison? Yes. Everything points to one of the Cyanides. Probably Potassium Cyanide. It acts instantaneously. It was not in the whiskey. It was in his glass? Seems like it. You mean - he must have put the stuff in his glass himself? Suicide, eh? That?s a queer go. Marston was not the kind of a guy to commit suicide like that. I want to swim out to the rock, Miss Claythorne. - But please. - No Cyril, I can't. - Please... - It's too far. Miss Vera, but please, let me swim to that rock. I love you, Vera. I can?t ask you to marry me. I?ve not got a penny. Although, just recently I considered myself rich until a baby boy was born. If a girl was born instead, I would have inherited the title and the fortune. You know, everything in life is a matter of luck. My Cyril is a sweet boy. I grew so fond of him. ?Ten little Indian boys went out to dine; One choked his little self?? One choked his little self? - Who is it? - Doctor. - What is it? - It?s the wife, doctor. I can?t get her to wake. - Dressing-gown. - Yes, yes. Here, here it is. Yes, she?s gone. Is she? She? Did she take things before, Rogers? To make her sleep? She didn?t have nothing last night, sir, except what you gave her, Doctor? What is it with him today? He forgot to give me coffee. You must excuse any shortcomings this morning. Rogers had to prepare the breakfast himself for Mrs. Rogers could not help him. She died in her sleep. Very remarkable? How awful! Two death on this island. It might have been heart failure, I suppose? Her heart certainly failed to beat - but what caused it to fail is the question. - Conscience! - What do you mean by that? You all heard, she was accused, together with her husband, of having deliberately murdered her former employer. You all saw her last night. She broke down completely and fainted. The shock of having her wickedness brought home to her was too much for her. That?s carrying things a bit far, Mrs. Brent. You regard it as impossible that a sinner should be struck down by the wrath of God! I do not! Mrs. Brent, Providence leaves the work of conviction and chastisement to us mortals. Allow for the moment that Rogers and his missus polished of that old lady. Well, where does that get you? They?ve been feeling quite safe and happy about it. No, I don?t think Mrs. Rogers ever felt safe. That?s as may be. Anyway there?s no active danger to them as far as they know. Then, last night, some unknown lunatic spills the beans. The woman cracks - she goes to pieces. Notice how her husband hung over her? Not all husbandly solicitude! He was like a cat on hot bricks. Scared out of his life as to what she might say, if the whole thing?s going to be racked up. Ten to one, the woman will give the show away. She hasn?t got the nerve to stand up and brazen it out. She?s a living danger to her husband that?s what she is. So he slips something into a cup of tea. There was no empty cup by her bedside. Of course there wouldn?t be! First thing he?d do would be to take that cup and saucer away? - But I should hardly think? - ?and wash it up carefully. But I should hardly think it possible that a man would do that - to his wife. When a man?s neck?s in danger, he doesn?t stop to think about sentiment. Is there anything more I can get you? I?m sorry but we?ve right run out of bread. The boat never came, and the food was not brought. What time does the motor boat usually come over? Between seven and eight, sir. Sorry to hear about your wife, Rogers. Doctor?s just been telling us. - Thank you, sir. - Accept my condolences. - We are all sorry. - So am I. Thank you. Excuse me. It?s not an accident ? that?s what I say, Mister Lombard. It?s part and parcel of the whole business. It?s all bound up together. The motor boat won?t come, you think? Of course it won?t come. You think not too, General? We?re counting on the motor boat to take us off the island. We?re not going to leave the island. It?s the end, you see - the end of everything. That?s peace - real peace. It's meaningless to undertake anything. Meaningless...useless. There goes another one who?s balmy. Looks as though it?ll end with the whole lot going that way. I don?t fancy you will, Blore. It wouldn?t take me off my head. And I don?t think you?ll be going that way, Mr. Lombard. Please, sir, if I could have word with you. - What?s the matter, man? - Inside, sir, come in here. There?s things going on that I don?t understand. You?ll think I?m crazy. Don?t go on talking in riddles, Rogers. It?s those little china figures. Ten of them, there are. I?ll swear to that, ten of them. Yes, ten. We counted them last night at dinner. That?s just it, sir. Last night, when I was cleaning up, there wasn?t but nine. I noticed it and thought it queer. But that?s all I thought. But now see for yourself, there?s only eight! Only eight. Do you really think what you said at breakfast, Miss Brent? What do you mean? Do you really think that Rogers and his wife did away with that old lady? It's not my business. But, Miss Brent, if it true? Well, there is that Mr. Lombard. He admits to having abandoned 20 men to their death. - They were only natives? - Black or white, they are our brothers. My own case? Well, I was not going to say anything last night. It was not a fit subject to discuss before gentlemen. Beatrice Taylor was in service with me. She was very clean and willing. It was some time before I found out that she was what they call "in trouble". Naturally I did not keep her an hour under my roof. Her parents were decent folk. They did not condone her sin. What happened to her? The abandoned creature committed a still graver sin. She killed herself? Yes, she threw herself into the river. What did you feel like when you knew she?d done that? Weren't you sorry? Didn?t you blame yourself? I had nothing with which to reproach myself. Her own action, her own sin that was what drove her to it. Remember: life is what you make of it. And the past concerns me only as much as I want it. Go ahead and don't look back! I asked Rogers this morning what this Miss Brady had suffered from. You know, his answer was enlightening. I don't need to go into medical details, but in a certain form of cardiac trouble, amylnitrite is used. When an attack comes on an ampoule of amylnitrite is broken and it is inhaled. If amyl nitrite were withheld well, the consequences might easily be fatal. - It must have been rather tempting. - No arsenic, no positive action just negation! And, even if any one knew, nothing could ever be proved. There are crimes that cannot be brought home to their perpetrators. Instance, the Rogerses?. Another instance, old Wargrave, who committed his murder strictly within the law. Everyone knew that Seton was innocent. Who doesn't remember that trial? Clearly, the judge simply got even with him. Wargrave murdered Edward as if he?d stuck a stiletto through him. I could continue with examples, doctor. I am listening Murder on the Operating Table. Safe as houses! All right, all right, there is some truth in this accusation. I was very hungover when I was operating then. You know, hands shaking, nerves all to pieces. Now we?re getting down to it. What?s the real purpose of getting us all here? What do you think? If you tell me that Anthony Marston, a young bull with no nerves and precious little brains, got the wind up over having moved down a couple of kids and deliberately put himself out of the way ? well, the idea?s laughable! - Anthony Marston was murdered, of course. - And Mrs. Rogers? I could believe in Mrs. Rogers? death if it weren?t for Anthony Marston. Two murdered. And two figurines have disappeared? The man must be a raving maniac! There?s one thing Mr. Owen didn?t realize. We shall make short work of searching it. - What do you mean? In no time. He?ll be dangerous. I?ll be dangerous when I get hold of him! Climbs like a cat, doesn't he? But I wouldn't trust him a yard. Why? Did you happen to bring a gun along with you, doctor? Me? Why should I? Why did Mr. Lombard? It's under his belt. I suppose - habit. It?s only in books people carry guns around as a matter of course. Ah! It?s you! Do you like sitting here looking out to sea? Yes, it?s pleasant. - It?s a good place to wait. - To wait? What are you waiting for? The end. But I think you know that, don?t you? We?re all waiting for the end. What do you mean? None of us are going to leave the island. That?s the Mr. Owen?s plan. You know it, of course, perfectly. What, perhaps, you can?t? ?understand is the? ?relief! The relief? You see, I loved Leslie. I loved her very much. - Was Leslie your wife? - I loved her and I was proud of her. That?s why... I did it. You mean? It?s not much good denying it now not when we?re all going to die. I sent Richmond to his death. It was murder. I had no regrets. - But afterwards? - Well, afterwards? Afterwards? I don?t know if Leslie ever guessed? But she?d gone far away where I couldn?t reach her. And then she died and I was alone. You?ll be glad, too, when the end comes. I don?t know what you mean! I know, my child, I know. Let's search the house, and then the island once more thoroughly. But this time you will be the one to go down. Quiet - listen. - Is this Rogers' bedroom? - But that's where Mrs. Rogers' body is. Of course! Best hiding place he could have chosen! I?m sorry, gentlemen. I was just moving my things. I take it there will be no objection... if I take one of the vacant guest chambers on the floor below? The smallest room. - Of course... Of course... - Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Sorry. I?d like to know what drug it was. Let?s get finished. I feel it in my bones we?re not going to find anything. Doctor, you did give her some dope, you know. Dope? You said yourself you?d give her something to make her sleep. I gave her a mild dose of trional. A harmless sedative. - A perfectly harmless preparation. - Not to mince matters ? you didn?t give her an overdose, did you? It?s possible, isn?t it, that you may have made a mistake? Doctors can?t afford to make mistakes of that kind, It wouldn?t be the first you?ve made if that gramophone record is to be believed! What's the sense of making yourself offensive? We're all in the same boat. We've got to pull together. What about your own pretty little spot of perjury? Perjury be damned! That?s a foul lie! You may try and shut me up, Mr. Lombard, but there are things I need to know and one of them is about you! - About me? Yes. I want to know why you brought a gun down here on a pleasant social visit? - You?re not nearly such a fool as you look. - That?s as may be. What about that gun? I brought it because I expected to run into a spot of trouble. You didn?t tell us that last night. You were holding out on us? - In a way, yes. - Well, come on, out with it. I was approached by a little Jewboy - Morris his name was. He said I?d got a reputation for being a good man in a tight place. He offered me a hundred guineas to come down here and keep my eyes open. I was hard up. I took it. Why didn?t you tell us all this last night? How was I to know that last night wasn?t exactly the eventuality I was here to cope with? - But now - you think differently? - Yes. I believe now that I?m in the same boat as the rest of you. That hundred guineas was just Mr. Owen?s little bit of cheese to get me into the trap. - Quiet. - This is a trap. I'll take my oath on that. Quiet. Someone is screaming. Gentlemen! Come here! Hurry! Gentlemen, gentlemen. General Macarthur... - What? He's murdered? - He's dead. One, two, three, four, five? Oh, Miss, I? I just came to see? You?re quite right, Rogers... There are only seven. Macarthur was hit with a life preserver or some such thing on the back of the head. - Did you find the actual weapon used? - No. This morning I was sitting on the terrace and observing your activities. You were searching the island for the unknown murderer? Quite right, sir. You had come, doubtless, to the same conclusion that I had. Now you understand why Mr. Owen enticed us to this island? He's a madman! A loony! - There's no one on the island, - I tell you. No one! - In the sense you mean, but no. I came to the same conclusion. Nevertheless, Mr. Owen, to give him the name he himself has adopted, is on the island. His goal is the execution of justice upon certain individuals for crimes which the law cannot touch. There is only one way in which this goal could be accomplished. Mr. Owen... among the guests. Consequently, Mr. Owen... is one of us. No, no, no. My dear young lady, this is no time for refusing to look facts in the face. We are all in grave danger. One of us is U.N.Owen. I agree that one of us is possessed by a devil. I suppose you'll leave the women out of it. Do I understand you to assert that women are not subject to homicidal mania? Of course not. But all the same... I think... Doctor, a woman would have been physically capable of striking the blow that killed poor Macarthur? Perfectly capable... given a suitable instrument such as a cosh. The other two death have resulted from the administration of drugs. I think that, no one will dispute is easily compassed by a person of the smallest physical strength. - You're mad! - My dear young lady, do try and restrain your feelings, I am not accusing you. I hope, Miss Brent, that you are not offended by my insistence that all of us are equally under suspicion. Now you're talking, sir! Let's go into it. As regards Marston I don't think there's anything to be done. A person actually in the room could have done that even more easily. Now take Mrs. Rogers. The people who stand out there are her husband and the doctor. Either of them could have done it as easy as winking. I protest! This is absolutely uncalled for! I swear that the doze I gave was perfectly. Dr. Armstrong, your indignation is very natural. Nevertheless you must admit that the facts have got to be faced. Either you or Rogers could have administered a fatal doze with the greatest ease. We come now to the death of General Macarthur. I myself will state at once that I have no valid alibi. I spent the morning sitting on the terrace. There were several periods during which it would have been possible for me to kill the General, and return to my chair. I was with Lombard and Armstrong all the morning. They'll bear me out. - You went to the house for a rope. - Of course, I did. Went straight there and straight back. You were a long time. What the hell do you mean by that? I only said you were a long time. During Mr. Blore's absence, were you two together? Certainly. That is, Lombard went off for a few minutes. I was only absent a minute or two. Did either of you two glance at your watches? No. A minute or two is a vague expression. - Miss Brent? - I took a walk with Miss Claythorne. - Afterwards I sat on the terrace. - I don't think I noticed you there. I was round the corner of the house. It was out of the wind there. As you can see, even our superficial inquiry into the circumstances shows that we cannot say definitely that any one person can be considered as cleared of all complicity. All we can do at present juncture is to consider what measures we must adopt to ensure our safety. So far the murderer has had an easy task since his victims have been unsuspicious. From now on it is our task to suspect each and every one amongst us. Forewarned is forearmed. We won't let it happen again. That's all. Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day. Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night. Shalt not be afraid... Shalt not be afraid... Miss Brent, let me in. Miss Brent. - It's me, Beatrice Taylor. - Ah, so it's you. Haven't I told you that you are fired. - I am cold. Let me in. - Get out of here. I want to sleep. To sleep. I know the murderer?s name. Her name is? Beatrice Taylor. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. What time is it? Thirty to ten. Wouldn't have believed I could have slept like that. Well, shows you've got an easy conscience. What happened? Why is there no breakfast yet? Rogers is missing. He isn't in his room. And there's no kettle on and the kitchen fire isn't lit. What if it's he? Where?s Miss Brent got to - that's another mystery? Good morning, gentlemen. The sea is as high as ever. I shouldn?t think any boat could put out today. Have you been wandering about the island alone? Don?t you realize that that?s an exceedingly foolish thing to do? I assure you that I kept an extremely sharp lookout. - Seen anything of Rogers? - No. Why? Look! The Indians! Look! There are six. Even if there had been any fingerprints, the rain washed them off. Miss Claythorne, we should make breakfast for the men. Breakfast will be ready in half an hour or so. Would it have needed great force, doctor? A woman could have done it if that's what you mean. Any one who's mentally unhinged has a good deal of unsuspected strength. Do they keep bees on this island? Tell me that. Where do we go for honey? Miss Claythorne. You thought I was mad. Haven?t you read that idiotic rhyme, have you? You have not? It?s up in all your bedrooms put there for you to study! ?Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks. One chapped himself in halves? And then there were six.? We might have come here straightaway if we?d had sense. And the next verse. ?Six little Indian boys playing with a hive. A bumblebee stung one? ?and then there were five.? I?m asking. Where is that bumblebee? Thank you? I?m all right now. You have such self-control, Miss Brent. I lived in India for a long time. My father was a Colonel. Thank you, Miss Claythorne. Anything the matter, Miss Brent? I... I wanted to help Miss Claythorne, but I feel so giddy. - Giddy, eh? - Yes. Must be a delayed shock. - I can give you some medicine. - No! I'll just sit here quietly till the giddiness passes off. Take a seat in this armchair, Miss Brent. You'll be more comfortable here. What a job we've got. No one will envy. - Except for them. Everything is relative, Blore. To them we are the lucky ones. That's enough. Let everyone stay where he is. Pretty soon there will be a corpse in every room anyway. It is she. She's gone mad. Old spinsters go that way. In the morning I went to the kitchen and saw her there. Calm, neat, didn't even forget to put the apron on. And the apron is probably Mrs. Rogers'. And says: " Breakfast will be ready in half an hour or so." She?s mad. Religious mania - thinks she?s God?s instrument. You know, she sits in her room and reads her Bible. That?s hardly proof positive of an unbalanced mentality. When Rogers was killed, she?d been down to look at the sea. The murderer of Rogers would take jolly good care to be rolled up in bed snoring. You?re missing the point, Mr. Lombard. She?d only do that if she knew that she had nothing to fear. That?s to say if she herself is the criminal. That?s a good point... Yes, I hadn?t thought of that. Glad you don?t still suspect me, Blore. I did start by thinking of you that gun and the queer story you told. But I?ve realized now that was really a bit too obvious. Hope you feel the same about me. All I can say is, if you?re the criminal, you?re a damned fine actor and I take my hat off to you. We?ll probably both be a couple of stiffs before another day is out, you did indulge in that spot of perjury, I suppose? Oh, here is goes. Landor was innocent right enough. The gang had got me squared and we got him put away for a stretch. Mind you, I wouldn?t admit this. If there were any witnesses. It?s just between you and me. Well, I hope you made a tidy bit out of it. Didn?t make what I should have done. And he got penal servitude and died in prison. - I couldn't know that he would die. - Sure, you couldn?t know. - That was your bad luck. - Mine? His, you mean. Yours, too. Because, as a result of it, your own life is going to be cut short. My? Not me! Anybody, but not me. I?m watching out for myself pretty carefully, I can tell you. Well, I?m not a betting man. And anyway if you were dead I wouldn?t get paid. Listen, how true this is: "And nations will fall into the pit, which they digged for themselves. And they will get caught up in the nets, which they set up themselves." Yes. I think, it's time to stop searching. The murderer is sitting in the dining-room. I bet, the murderer is this old spinster. And the motive? The motive? Come. Here she is. Miss Brent? Miss Brent? Damn it! She?s dead! One more of us poisoned - too late! Look - a bumblebee. It wasn?t that bee that stung her! A human hand held the syringe. That?s the mark of a hypodermic syringe. The bumblebee is dead. ?A bumblebee stung one and then there were five? He?s a playful beast. Likes to stick to his damnable nursery jingle as closely as possible! It?s mad. We have still, I hope, our reasoning powers. Did any one bring a syringe to this house? I did. Always travel with one. Most doctors do. - Quite so. - Where that syringe is now? - In the suitcase in my room. We might, perhaps, verify that fact. Please. Somebody must have taken it! I tell you someone must have taken it. There are five of us here in this room. One of us... ...is a murderer. The position is fraught with grave danger. We must do something! You, Mr. Lombard, have in your possession a gun. I?m damned if I?ll give up my gun! Mr. Lombard, you are a very strongly built man, but ex-Inspector is also a man of powerful physique. Dr. Armstrong and we will on Blore?s side, and assist him to the best of our ability. Oh, very well then. I?ll fetch it. I think it would be desirable if we went with you. Oh, very well then. Please. What? Of course! The engine?s not been run today since Rogers hasn?t been there to see to it. We could go out and get it going, I suppose. There are packets of candles in the larder, I saw them, better use those. Doctor, help me please. And just where is the gun? It's here, in the house. Only the owner of the gun can answer this question. You are an idiot, Blore. How many times do I have to say that it was stolen. I've got a terrible headache. I'll go, lie down. Of course, of course. We will guard your sleep. - Would you like us to follow you? - No, thank you. If needed, I will call. I am listening. It seems to me you have something to say. The more I think about this matter, the more it seems to me... that all threads lead to one person. In the meantime, we'll be all killed in our sleep. Well, I agree, but on one condition: that we keep all together Who is alone makes it easier for the maniac. Look at that! Miss Claythorne? What's it with her? Miss Claythorne. Doctor! - What is that? - Head on the pillow, there. Wake up, Miss Claythorne. What was that? Seaweed? Why seaweed? You?d better drink this, Miss Claythorne. - Drink it yourself. - I got it from downstairs. Good for you, Vera! You?ve got your wits about you. What is it? What? Don't even dare say that I wanted to poison... Here... - Here?s one murder that hasn?t gone according to plan! - You think - that was what was meant? - Expected you to pass out through fright! Some people would have, wouldn?t they, doctor. Hmm, impossible to say. Miss Claythorne - young healthy subject no cardiac weakness. Unlikely? - Where?s the judge? Incidentally, where?s the judge? - He, too, heard screaming. - So, where is he? - We were together. - Where's he? Seems like we've been tricked again. - Mr. Wargrave, where are you? - Mr. Wargrave! Quiet! The judge is killed. Look, he has his wig on, and the mantle. Five little Indian boys going in for law? One got in Chancery... and then there were four. That's the end of Mr. Bloody Justice Wargrave. No more sending innocent men to death. Here's the last time he?ll ever sit in court. How Edward Seton would laugh if he were here! Only four of us now? Who?ll be the next? We must be very careful? You?re repeating the judge?s words. That?s what he said? And now he?s dead! It worked just as it was intended to. The murderer was able to frighten Miss Claythorne, and the rest went according to his plan. - Why didn?t any one hear the shot? - You was screaming, the wind was howling, we were calling out. No, it wouldn?t be heard. But that trick?s not going to work again. He?ll have to try something else next time. Good night, Miss Claythorne. Don't forget to lock. - If something - scream. - Yes, of course. - Good night, Miss Claythorne. - Good night. Who's this? Cyrill, is it you? Ah, Cyrill... Just a second, baby. I will let you in right now. Just a moment, baby, just a little moment. Mr. Lombard. Mr. Lombard, Mr. Lombard, it's me. Please, open. - What happened? - Don't know. You need to drink something, Miss Claythorne I am scared. I am so frightened, Mr. Lombard. - So frightened. - Have a drink. You' ll feel better. Have this... Drink this, Miss Claythorne. The most important - we have to make it through this night, and then this nightmare will be over. Calm down. Oh, my Goodness, what am I doing? Mr. Lombard... Mr. Lombard. Let everything go as it does. Mr. Lombard. Mr. Lombard, Mr. Lombard, I will scream! No! Go ahead, scream. At night, half-naked, visiting a man, and then to scream for help - that's ridiculous. Indeed, everything is so ridiculous. Come on, Miss Claythorne, easy, calm down. If it is one of them - which do you think it is? I take it you are excepting our two selves? Well, that's all right. I know very well that I'm not the murderer, and I don't fancy that there's anything insane about you. Thank you. Come now, Miss Claythorne, aren't you going to return the compliment? You've admitted that you don't hold human life sacred, but all the same I can't see you as the man who dictated that gramophone record. Quite right. This mass clearance is not my line of country. Please, be so kind - pass matches to me, there in the drawer. Doctor? Doctor, open. It's Blore. Doctor? Don't come close to me, don't come close, I'll scream. I, myself, am ready to scream with rage. I'm telling you, someone set me up. It's as unexpected for me, as it is for you. - Who?s there? - It?s Blore. Get dressed, Lombard. Something happened? Put your flashlight away. Happened. Armstrong is not in his room. And Miss Claythorne isn't in hers either. - Miss Claythorne is with me. She was scared to be alone. - Miss Claythorne, are you here? - Yes. Well, at least, it's natural. Exactly, buddy. It happens sometimes between a man and a woman. Armstrong isn't in his room. I heard screaming outside. After him, Blore. This time we'll get him. Wait a minute. Vera, we?re hunting Armstrong. Don?t open your door. If Armstrong comes along and says that I've been killed, or Blore?s been killed, pay no attention. Only open your door if both Blore and I speak to you. Got that? We?d better be careful. He?s got a gun, remember. That?s where you?re wrong. I?ve got that gun! Found it put back in my drawer tonight. And now - after him! The hunt's up! Don?t be a damned fool! I?m not going to shoot you! Go back, if you?re afraid! Even birds are leaving this cursed place. Stormy. Again no boat will be able to land. There are only 3 figurines left. That means Armstrong is killed. Then why haven?t you found his dead body? Indeed, strange. We searched the entire house and the island. - It might have been thrown into the sea. - By whom? You? Me? I don't know. - But I do know one thing. - What?s that? - The gun is in your possession now, - My good blockhead, I swear to you that it was put back in my drawer. You ask us to believe a thing like that! Why the devil should Armstrong, or any one else for that matter, put it back? I haven?t the least idea. There seems no point in it. No, there isn?t. You might have thought of a better story. Rather proof that I?m telling the truth, isn?t it? - I don?t look at it that way. - You wouldn?t. Look here, Mr. Lombard, if you?re an honest man, as you pretend. - No, indeed, I never said that. - If you?re speaking the truth - there?s only one thing to be done. Don?t be an ass. That gun?s mine and I?m going to keep it. - In that case I?m bound to come? - Yes, Mr. Owen! Think what you damned well please. But if that?s so, why I didn?t pot you with the gun last night? I could have, about twenty times over. - I don?t know. You must have had some reason. I think you?re both behaving like a pair of idiots. - What?s this? - You?ve forgotten the nursery rhyme. Four little Indian boys going out to sea? A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. A red herring!.. Armstrong?s not dead! He took away the china Indian to make you think he was. Maybe, this time our Mr. X decided to change his tune? But don?t you see, he?s mad? The whole thing of going by the rhyme is mad! At any rate there?s no Zoo on the island. - What Zoo? - The one the next verse talks about: "Three little Indian boys walking in the Zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two." Don?t you see? We?re the Zoo? We were hardly human anymore. We turned into beasts. Time to lunch. I?m not going back to the house. Oh, come now, Miss Claythorne. Got to keep your strength up. If I even see a tinned ham, I shall be sick! Well, as for me, I need my meals regular. What about you, Mr. Lombard? You know, I?ll stay here with Miss Claythorne. It?s all right if you say so. But remember, we agreed we ought not to separate. Are you afraid? I?ll come with you if you like? - No, you won?t, - So you?re still afraid of me? I could shoot you both this very minute if I liked. Yes, but that wouldn?t be according to plan. It?s one at a time, and it?s got to be done in a certain way. Well, you seem to know all about it. Of course, it?s a bit jumpy going up to the house alone. And therefore, will I tend you my gun? - Answer, no! - As you please. - What if he is this Owen? - What do we know about the man? Less than nothing! All this ex-policeman story may be bunkum! He may be anybody - a mad millionaire, a crazy business man. He could have done every one of these crimes. And supposing he gets - us? Don?t worry. Touching faith in me, haven?t you, Vera? Quite sure I wouldn?t shoot you? One has got to trust some one. I heard a sort of cry. - We?d better go up and see. - No. Blore is dead! I don't believe you! No... See for yourself! Whose is that window just above? It?s mine. - What is it? - The clock? ?from my mantelpiece member now. "A big bear hugged one and then there were two." Clearly, it's Armstrong. This time I won't miss him. Careful! We are next! He wants us to look for him! He?s counting on it! Maybe, let's go down to the sea? It's not as windy over there. Look! Over there, in water! - But that's Armstrong! - What do you say, Vera? There?s no one on the island - no one at all except us two. No one? You got it right on. Now we know what to do. Don?t you feel that there?s someone watching and waiting? No, I don?t believe in the supernatural. This business is human enough. That?s conscience? Tell me, you did drown that kid after all? No! No! No, I didn?t! You?ve no right to say that! Oh, my good girl! I don?t know why. There was a man in it probably, was that it? Yes - there was a man in it. Poor Dr. Armstrong. What?s this? Womanly pity? Why not? Haven?t you any pity? I?ve no pity for you. We must move him. As far as I?m concerned he can stay where he is. Help me! Go away! Satisfied? Quite. So that?s the reason for your womanly solicitude! Give that gun to me. Now look here, my dear girl, you just listen. You?re behind the times, my dears. You can come with me. We?ve won, my dear! No? No? I don?t want to? "One little Indian boy left all alone. He went and hanged himself and then there were none." "Ten little Indian boys went out to dine?" Never has Justice risen to such a brilliant height as it has done here. Without jesters? hats and mantles, without corrupt lawyers-liars. One-on-one - the judge and the criminal. One-on-one - the criminal and the executioner. Execution... That?s Alpha and Omega of Truth. And she understood that. Vera Claythorn? And she carried out the sentence herself. That means I am right. I am chosen. I have been preparing for this for a long time. Hundreds of acquitted criminals, murderers, perverts, and as many of those, who were innocently brought to the scaffold, dispelled my doubts completely. I began to collect victims, who managed to escape from their punishment. To find them was not hard. I was able to acquire incognito Indians Island. I sent an invitation to each guest, according to the information I had gathered. They all arrived to the island on the same day. After the third death the guests searched the island and realized that they were alone there. According to my plan I should shortly need an ally. I selected Dr. Armstrong for that part. I asked him to feign my death. It would perhaps rattle the murderer. That same evening the show was carried out. Nobody worried about me anymore. I had a rendezvous with Armstrong at 2 o?clock. They are not suspecting anything. Everything is going as planned. I found something. All day long I was watching Lombard out the window. Look. Down there. The entrance to a cave. - Where? - Over there. Now, when my duty is fulfilled, and Justice, cleansed of all filth, is triumphant, I will take the step that only the greatest judge can take. Because the true greatness of a judge lies in his ability to punish himself!
