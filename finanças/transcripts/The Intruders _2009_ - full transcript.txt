That's very nice cake. Hold the cake for a second. Cut, cut. (soft somber music) (clearing throat) - Mama, still the most beautiful woman I've ever met. Come here. - Ooh, really. (lips smacking) You don't think the earrings are too much? - Never. Come here. Remember Michael? - [Madeline] Oh yes, my other son. The one who wants to save the homeless. - Happy birthday, mother. - Give us your smelly masses. Where's my cake? Is this a birthday party or a funeral? What, no male strippers? - You okay? - I shouldn't have come. - I'm proud of you for facing the old bird. (Michael sighing) - Before you father when Frank Sinatra and I were an item, we would go to the soda fountain for an egg cream. I spent my 23rd birthday there. What a man. I should've married him. Your grandmother was major babeage, young man. I was gorgeous. - You still are, mama. - Why don't you blow out the candles mother, so we can cut the cake? - Okay party pooper. (blows) (guests applauding) - Hey. - Hi baby, sorry I'm late. - It's okay. - I was showing a house. - How'd it go? - Good. - Great. Here, come on. - Hi, happy birthday. - Thank you, darling. - Hey, how are you? Hi, I'm Bernadette. - I'm Michael. - Nice to meet you, Michael. Hi. - Hi, I'm Annie. - Nice to meet you. - This is my brother. - Ooh, you guys have such an amazing house. - I'm very happy with my house, thank you. It's very welcoming. - That is my grandson there. I almost didn't recognize you. - Happy birthday. - Thank you for inviting us. - Ah, did I invite you? That Marilyn Monroe-- - Let's go. - Good night. - Never wearing any pants. That's why I stopped, she said it breaks up the line. There, see? Fancies mess up everything. - With the winds from the south at 17 miles... (tires screeching) - [Man] Get him! - The hell what was that? Whoa! (intense chase music) Hey! - C'mon, get up! - Let's go. - Get him up. (muffled crosstalk) (fist thudding) (Jesse shouting) (muffled crosstalk) - Hey, hey! What the fuck? Sons of bitches! Hey kid, you okay? Hey hey hey, don't worry kid. Hey, c'mon c'mon, don't try to move. What happened? What's your name? Jesse? - Jesse. - Jesse, you're gonna be alright, okay? You're gonna be alright. Listen, cops are coming now. You're gonna be okay. - No cops. - No, don't try to move. What're you doin'? No no no, don't go anywhere. Look, c'mon man. Why don't... Shit. (cellphone ringing) Oh fuck. Hi, Roger. - [Roger] Where are you, kiddo? - I'm standing in the middle of some filthy alley. I don't know. - That's really nice. Aren't you coming to the meeting? Ferguson's rejecting our entire (mumbles) deal. Got a clause in there that makes his reject invalid. - (sighs) What time's the meeting? - (mumbles) meeting's in five minutes. This whole nice guy routine is not workin'. It was your idea and I need ya down here now. - Okay, (mumbles) okay. - To sum it all up, the most important factor in this contract is the 32% that you guys feel overrides our decision to build these homeless shelters. - Important's the key word, Mr Bergman. You're a business man aren't you, and you like contracts? Well contracts are made to be broken. According to that contract, it's not valid unless (mumbles) holds up his end of the deal, which he hasn't done since January. - That's a matter of opinion. - No sir, that is a fact. Should I present them to you or did Mr Foster? Where is Mr Foster anyway? - Okay, sorry about that folks. I'm late. - Would a recess be helpful? - No no no no, please we're gonna be fine. Please proceed. What'd I miss? - We're in the middle of the meeting. - Okay. - I was explaining to your representative here is that this contract has an out clause and if you don't-- - Yes, Myra? - I'm sorry to interrupt, your wife's on the line. - Okay, please tell her I'll call her later. - She says it's urgent. - Alright, I've gotta take this call. I'm really sorry. - No no don't go now. - Gotta go. I've got to take this, I'm sorry. - Bergman, you sure about that recess or do you wanna continue? - No no no, I wanna wait for Michael to come back. - Annie, I'm right in the middle of the biggest presentation of the year, okay? I got sidetracked this morning. I was late. You can't even imagine what happened to me. - Honey, I think you need to come home. What, why? What is so urgent? - [Annie] She's gone. - My mother? (sighs) - [Annie] I'm sorry. (Michael sighing) - Ooh no. (sobbing) (phone banging) (water trickling) (Michael sobbing) I'm okay, I'm okay. (screams) What're you doin' here? - Your mother's loss is my loss, too. - Really? Really? You never loved her. She (mumbles). Just go away. - I can't. I got a meeting to conduct. - No no no no, you're conducting that. I'm postponing the meeting, okay? - Oh really? - Yeah. - You think these people would be happy to hear that, Michael? I don't think so! There are homeless people all over this city just need a place to live! - Well I'll take care of it, okay? Just get outta here! You're going to have some very angry people at you, Mike. - I don't give a fuck! - Look, I conducted this meeting. These people need a place to stay! (soft, somber music) I apologize for the interruption, there will be no more. Let us continue. - I have a family emergency. I have to call off this meeting, I'm sorry. - No, we are going to have this meeting now! - No, I said no! - Is everything alright? - No no, I'm terribly sorry alright? - (mumbles), what was that? What the fuck was that? - I don't have the foggiest idea. - What happened? - (sobs) They beat me... They beat me senseless. - Who? What, those punks? - They always come back. They do it over and over again. - No. - I have no place to go. - No no no no, it's okay. It's gonna be okay. - I have no place to go. - No no no, it's alright. It's okay, you're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. (ominous music) (hard rock music) - Are you gonna hang out tonight? - Where? - Hollywood? - Gonna pick me up? - Do I have a choice? - See you at 8:00. - Okay come on, can we go now? - (giggles) I'll see you at 8:00. - See ya at 8:00. (soft, somber music) - Your grandmother died. - What? - This morning, honey. I'm sorry. This is Jesse. He's going to be staying with us for a while. - No. No, why? - Because that's what your father needs right now, honey. - Really? This is what we needs? Well how many others are gonna be moving in, huh? - I don't know. - How many fucking others? - Shh. Josh. Yes, Sofia? Hi this is Annie Foster, Michael Foster's wife. I think he needs you. (muffled news reporter speech) Hey Joshua, are you goin' someplace? - Out. - Oh honey, I don't think that's a very good idea tonight. - Why? I barely knew my grandmother. - Out of respect for your father. - Who died and left you in charge? Wait, don't answer that. - Oh hello, Joshua. - Oh hi, it's you again. - [Sofia] Oh my gosh, you've grown up. - Yeah. - I got here as soon as I could. - I know, thank you so much. (mumbles) it's good to see you. - Well where is Michael? - Well, Michael hasn't been here all night. I think I made a mistake. I don't think I should've been the one to tell him. - No sweetheart don't blame yourself, okay? Hello. Well you must be Lily. - Yeah, I remember you. What do you want? - Well actually I'm here to talk with Michael. - Didn't Annie tell you? Michael's not here. - Hmm, then what are you doing here? - I'm staying here now. - Is that so? - Yeah, I was invited. I don't think you were though. - Where are you going? - Does it matter? - It'll matter to Michael. - Ooh, you gotta be kidding. Michael doesn't run my life anymore. - Wait a minute, please. No, wait. - Just let her go. - Sofia. - Just let her go. It will all work out, okay? - When, by tomorrow? Because Michael's gonna wanna go to his mother's wake tomorrow. - Okay, well then we'll all go together. - What if his dd shows up or Isaac? - We will deal with that when it happens. Let's just hope it doesn't. Have you seen his father? - No. - Isaac? - No, but Lily was enough for me. (energetic dance music) - Oh my God, I love this place. - I love you. - There's my boy, 'sup Joshua? - What's up, Cory? - How're you doin'? - Doin', baby? - Hey Miss Bree, (mumbles). - Hi Cory. - Hey Josh. - What you doin', man? (Bree mumbling) - You're a fool. (women groaning) - Be nice. - Baby, let's go. - Alright we're gonna dance, alright? - (mumbles)? - Yes. - Yes. - I don't know what's gotten into you, but I love it. (chuckles) I've got Jenna's car keys. - Oh, I am so sorry. - Thank you. - There you go. Wait a minute, I know you. - Maybe. - You don't remember me, do you? - Should I? - Hey, you want some company? - Maybe, that depends on exactly what you're looking for. - A little fun for now. You? - Hmm. (Bree and Josh giggling) - You're so big. - I am. (Bree giggling) It's what I do. - (mumbles) getting dizzy. (lips smacking) (ominous music) - Yo, c'mon Bree. - Car's that way. - Just come on. - Josh, the car is that way. - [Woman] You should see these little silver sandals I got. They're so gorgeous. (muffled crosstalk) I love it, love it, love it. It's got wonderful areas you can walk to. (birds chirping) (Michael groaning) (soft, somber music) (doorbell ringing) - Sofia, hi. Please come in. - Thank you. I just wanna apologize for last night. I didn't know that he was gonna come in at that hour. - Don't even worry about it, Annie. It's the nature of the beast. I completely understand. - I appreciate it. - So what time did he get in last night? - It was more like morning. I was already asleep. - Huh, where is he now? - Upstairs getting ready. - Okay. (Michael breathing heavily) Michael? I am sorry for your loss. - Thank you. - I don't know if Lily told you I was here last night. - Yeah, I know. - Where did you go? (Michael sighing) Okay, okay, okay. We won't go there. (Michael weeping) (soft, somber music) Okay, okay. - I can't, I can't. - Okay. - I can't. - Okay, I won't. Are you ready to go to your mother's wake? - (sighs) Of course. I have to be; I have to be there. - Well I want you to know that I'm going to be there right by your side, every step of the way. Okay? - You're a good friend, Sofia. - So who's coming with us to the wake? (birds chirping) (soft, somber music) (Raymond weeping) - Okay okay okay, I'm good. (Raymond weeping) Okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - We're gonna be okay, brother. - [Annie] Raymond, do you wanna go outside and get some fresh air? - Yeah. - Alright. I love you, baby. - Michael, I'm terribly sorry. - It's alright; thank you, Roger. Thanks. Did you close that shelter deal? - Man, don't worry about that now. You're most important. - No, those people need. - Get yourself together. - People need a place to live, okay. They're gonna need a place to live. - I got you covered, kiddo. - Okay. - I got you covered. - Okay. Alright. (sighs) - Let's go. - Okay, okay. (soft, somber music) (Michael weeping) Okay, I'm gonna need a minute. - Of course. - (mumbles) okay? - Okay. (Raymond weeping) - Raymond, listen. I know we haven't always been that close, but I just want you to know that I'm very sorry about your mother's death. (cries) I'm sorry. - Hmm. (foreboding music) My precious Madeline, I cannot believe you're dead. So you finally kicked the bucket. You really are a cunt! You did this. You made your son this way. You dirty whore! I hope you rot in Hell! You filthy child molester! - Lou, where is Michael? - He needs to stay away from this woman! She's the one. She's the one who destroy him! But you can't touch me! (spits) - Come on. - You can't touch me! - Come on, help me find Michael. - Yeah everyone, please pay him no mind. He's crazy. - What just happened back there? - What did it look like? (foreboding music) - You called Madeline a child molester, why? - Because she was. - I thought so. So that's why you're here now, isn't it? - I don't know what you talkin' about, Miss Drake. - Annie told me about Jesse. A hurt, afraid, lonely little boy just like Michael was. - What are you trying to do? - It has to make sense, Lou. Your purpose here, and Jesse's, and Lily's. - Oh, Lily's home? I haven't seen her yet. - Yes, Lily is here. Michael's beloved ex wife and mother of his child. The most precious thing he had, a perfect picture. It is normal to miss her and to want to bring her back into his life. Wouldn't you say so, Lou? - All this chatter is wearing me down. I'm here because my son needs me and I have to help him. He needs all of us. - No he doesn't, Lou. You're all hurting Michael. - That's what you think? Would you like to see Michael now? - I would love to see Michael now. - Good, come with me. (birds chirping) - Do you carry a gun with you all the time? - Yes. - Yeah, we used to keep a gun in the house. It scared the hell outta me. - It's been such a long time since I've been here. - I know. - You know, my mother, she did... She didn't do anything to Michael. I don't care what he says. I don't really care what anyone says. - Raymond, you have to know that Michael loved his mother. - Then why'd he... (Bree laughing) - Yeah, oh yeah. - I'm sorry. Why didn't you tell me your grandmother died? I would've gone to the funeral. - 'Cause I didn't really care. Oh come on, don't look at me like that. You know that expression only the good die young? Well, she should have lived to be 400. - That's old. - I could lay here and tell you stories about her until the middle of next year. But I don't wanna risk the chance of her coming back and haunting me. - (laughs) She can't be that bad. - Trust me, she was. - You wanna go in? - No, my father's coming home soon. - So what? I thought you said he would adore me. - Not anymore. - You know, I feel like every time this Sofia Drake person comes into the picture, something bad happens. - [Annie] That's not true. - Oh, it isn't? Please tell me how any of this makes sense to you at all. - I wouldn't expect you to understand any of it. (phone ringing) Hello. - Annie, I had a long talk with Michael. - Okay, where is he? - Well, we came to my house. I actually don't know where he is right now. But I have to warn you. I have a feeling I know who your next guest is going to be. - (sighs) Oh God, who? - Isaac is on his way over. (ominous music) Annie, you know how dangerous Isaac is. He cannot stay in that house. Call the police. You do not let him in! - What are you talking about? I can't call the police. You know that. - For your best interest and for the best interest of your son, you cannot let him in. - Look please, just stop it alright. I made a mistake. I shouldn't have called you. You're making things worse. Please don't call here. - Annie? Annie? - What is it? - Issac is on his way. - See, see what I mean? - Fuck you! (sinister music) - Whoo! I'm home, baby. The fuck you lookin' at? - Joshua, get in the house now. - He's fuckin' crazy. - Josh, just get in the house please. - What you gonna do, huh? - Fuck you what am I gonna do. What the fuck are you gonna do? - I can arrest you right now. - Are you gonna arrest me? What grounds, you fuckin' pig? - It's alright, Ray. Let's go in the house right now and lock the door please. - Lemme in this fuckin' house, bitch! (Isaac mumbling) - He's going insane. I have to-- - I know, just let him... Let him calm down, okay. He's going-- - Yeah goin' where and do what? - I don't know, but please. Just give it a minute. - You're making this worse, Annie. - You can't arrest him anyway. This is not your jurisdiction. - Listen to me, I'm not gonna stand here and do nothing while this maniac tries to break into this house. - Fuckin' owe me this house! - Get out of my way before I arrest you. - Alright, alright, alright. (Annie whispering) (crickets chirping) (Jesse crying) (foreboding music) - (weeps) I'm afraid. I'm afraid. - It's okay. It's okay. Shhh! Joshua, come on down honey. Breakfast is ready. - Okay, we gotta get that room fixed upstairs. That's dad's room; I promised to fix it. - Honey, what's going on? What are you doing and where are you going? - I'm going to work. I've fallen way behind. There's dozens of homeless people who need a place to live and I'm here. - Great, why don't we just invite everybody here. - What? - Nothing. Honey, listen to me okay. I spoke to Roger. He's got everything under control. Okay baby, it's too early for you to go back to work. - I can't, I can't stay here. - No! - This isn't helping me. - Listen to me, the pressure of work's not gonna do you any good. You need time off. - (scoffs) No, I had time off. How much time do I need? - Baby, I don't know. Maybe when I get to spend some time with my husband, the man that I married. Or maybe once these intruders stop coming in and out of our lives, in this house, in my life. Please. - I'm sorry, I have to go to work. - What's he doin' here? - Good morning to you too, son. - (whispers) Don't. ♪ Mmmm ♪ - Good morning, Annie. I almost forgot my lunch. Michael! (Josh laughing) - Now you let me conduct this meeting the way it should be done. - [Michael] I'm conducting the meeting. I'm conducting the meeting, okay. - Michael, I'm your mouthpiece. You can't do this without me. (Michael breathing heavily) - Just shut up. Shut up! Yes I can! Yes I can! Just leave me the fuck alone, okay? Just get outta my life! Get outta my car! Just get outta my car! Get the fuck outta my life! Get outta my car! What? (phone ringing) - Hello. - [Annie] Raymond, it's Annie. - Oh hey, Annie. - [Annie] Sorry, did I wake you? - No no, actually it's fine. What's up? - Listen, I wanna get the phone number of your friend. You know, the real estate agent. - Bernie? Yes actually. She just so happens to be right next to me. Hold on. (Raymond chuckling) - Annie, hi. How are you? - Could be better. I think I need to sell our house. - Oh. (ominous music) - Leave me alone. Will you go away? - You can't do this without me. - Yes I fucking can! I can do it! - I'm not going to leave you alone. (Michael weeping) Help me! Help me! Help me! (muffled crosstalk) - Hey Josh. God Josh, where you been? - Around. - I haven't seen much of you since that night at your house. Have you been avoiding me? - (sighs) I don't wanna talk about it, okay? I'm late to class. - God Josh, what the hell is this all about? I mean did your uncle end up arresting that guy? I have so many questions. It just kind of freaked me out. - Yeah, wasn't that just great? I'm late to class, alright. - What is going on with you? - Back off, okay. - That's it. It's alright. Set your feet, Lashay. That's it. Nice, clean shot. Nice. Next time you're not in uniform, Sierra, you're gonna run a suicide. Hold your feet. Almost. Marina. (whistle blowing) Can I get you to take my place? Very good, keep going girls. Marina's got it. (balls smacking floor) Hey, is everything alright? - I don't know how long we can go on like this. - Look Josh, I have a very special place in my heart for you and your dad. The day I married your father, you became my son. I'm committed to that and I'm not gonna walk away from either one of you, you hear me? - Thank you. - Alright Sierra, that's not how I taught you to dribble the ball. - Hi Josh. - Come on now, get back to practice. Focus girls, come on. (girls clapping rhythmically) I swear that girl is such a flirt. - She's hot. - Yeah, I'm afraid she knows it. Wait a second, don't you have a girlfriend? (ball smacking floor) Honey, are you gonna be alright? Huh? - Yeah I guess I'd better go. - Okay sweetie, I'll see you at home, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Alright, let's keep the focus. (mumbles) that's okay. - [Josh] I love you, mom. - I love you too, Joshy. (soft, somber music) (whistle blowing) (soft pop music) - Um, excuse me. - What? - You're trying everything on and you're making a mess. - And? - Are you going to buy anything? - (scoffs) Would you just leave me alone and let me make up my mind? You're hounding me. - My God, you're sick. - Fuck you. Ooh, hey handsome. Mmm, not bad. (phone ringing) - Hello. Michael, you here? Hello? - [Roger] Hello, Annie? It's Roger. - [Annie] Hi Roger. - I'm just callin' to see if everything;s okay with Michael. - Why, what did he do? - He just called this morning, said he was coming into the office and he never showed. - Uh yeah, yeah Roger. Everything is fine. You know what, I gotta go. But thank you so much for calling and you have a great night. - Michael! You scared me. Where have you been? Roger just called. He said you didn't make it to work today. - I just lost track of time today, that's all. I just-- - What? - I think I'd better go lay down. I just need some rest. (phone banging on table) (keys rattling) (door slamming) (muffled crosstalk) - [Man] There's no way. I don't wanna live in this house. (muffled crosstalk) If you think you're going to... I know that I'm gonna stay here. (muffled crosstalk) But Michael, Michael you... (soft, somber music) - Now the baker's sells the coconut cake too. We have, here we go. - [Guests] cake, cake, cake! - Mr and Mrs... Whoa whoa whoa. Right there, right there. And here we go. We're goin' again in one for... One for me. Her first. (wedding guests awing) That's really good. That's really good cake. That's really good. Now this is your cake. That's really great though. I don't know, can she handle the big one? - [Guests] cake, cake, cake! (wedding guests cheering) - I love you, Michael. I will always love you. (Michael weeping) - Hi, table for one? - No thank you, I'm actually meeting someone. She's already here. - I'll be right with you. - Great. - Hey. - How are you? - I'm good, thanks. - I'm so sorry I'm late. I had to stop of at the house and pick something up. I apologize. - Don't worry about it, I just got here. Anything to get me out of the office. Would you like a cup of coffee? - Yeah sure, that'd be great. - Excuse me. Hi, can we get two cups of coffee, please? - Sure. - Thank you. I just wanna thank you so much for meeting me here. It know it was last minute, I appreciate it. - It's no problem. It sounded really important when you called. - Yeah, I think I... I think I really need to sell that house. - It's a beautiful house. Annie, don't worry. I'm not gonna have a problem selling it. (soft, soothing music) - You know, I don't know if you know all the details. But the house, it's not in my name. - I know, Raymond told me everything. Annie look, I'm here because I'm your friend. I'm not just your real estate agent, okay? We're gonna work this out. Hey, it's gonna be okay. - I appreciate it. - Anytime, sweetie. (soft guitar music) - Hello? (video game controller clicking) - Josh, what's going on? - I just gotta get the hell out of here right now. - Where are you going? Josh, wait! (feet stomping) (soft ominous music) (phone dialing) Yeah Sofia, it's Annie again. - Jesse? Jesse, I've never met you before. I'm Sofia Drake, a good friend of Michael's. Can you come down from there? - What do you want? - I wanna meet you, ask a few questions. - No, I don't wanna answer any questions. - They're simple questions, Jesse. - [Jesse] Like? - Well, I wanna know when you plan on leaving. - I can't leave. Michael needs me. - I don't know how true that is. Where did you meet Michael? - In an alley on the street. He protected me. - Are you afraid of something, Jesse? Can you please, please come down from there? - No. - Okay, fine. Well, I'll just talk to you from here then. When Michael was a little boy, he had a difficult time finding friends. Did you know that? He overcame it. He was married, created a family. He has a grown son. What do you think about that? - I know, I know all of this. - Okay well then you know he's happily married to Annie and that you're an intrusion on their lives right now, right? I guess you don't care. How old are you, Jesse? - 16. Hey, hey! Hey! - You get down now off this roof alright? (hammer banging) - What are you doin'? - I'm selling the house. - You can't do that. You can't sell the house. - Okay, I'm gonna make this as easy as possible. Okay? - Hey what's goin' on? So you're sellin' the house? - Yup, I'm gonna try. - Wow, how in the world did you get Michael to agree to that? - I have no idea. He came home late one night and I threw the papers at him and he signed. - Hmm. (electronic dance music) (muffled speech) - Let him go! - Whoa whoa, okay. - Shut up! Come on, Sierra. (muffled speech) - What the fuck? - (mumbles), Josh. What's goin' on, man? - Woo! - How you doin'? - I've been better. - Hey, you lookin' good though. - You too, man. - Thanks for comin' out with me tonight. - Hey, you know my girl Lashae? - Hey! - That's Sierra over here. - (laughs) Hi. - Hi. - Hey hey hey, we gonna hit the dance floor, okay? - (mumbles) alright. - Alright, come on babe. Let's go. See ya later, man. - Call me, okay? - I'll call you. - So is this some kind of set up? - Maybe. So you and Bree broke up? - Yeah, good guess.

(Sierra panting) (Isaac grunting) (women shouting) - Hang on, baby. - Yes. - Baby, I ain't crashin' shit. - Why did you crash? - I didn't crash. - You did crash. - I gotta get my boy outta the car safe. - It's a crash. - That's not a crash, alright. You want this boy to crash his ass on cement. - Okay. - Joshua. Hey, Joshua. - Sierra. - [Cory] You gonna do this all night, man? Come on. Hey, you gonna be alright? Can you stand up? You good?

(Josh retching) - Josh, what happened? - Fuck you, what happened? - Joshua, Joshua, Joshua. Move this shit so I can talk to you. Hey, I heard you had a pretty damn good night. - Yo Cory, let it go man. - Let it go? - I wanna hear your si-- - Let it go, man. Please. Let's talk about something else. Cool? - Yeah! - Hey. - Hey. - Alright. Good luck. - Gimme a minute? Sierra's goin' around school telling everyone what happened with you guys last night. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. We're not together anymore, right? Look, I know what's going on with you at home. - What do you know? - Everything. Everyone at school knows. I know it's crazy, but if you need a friend I'm here okay? Okay. See you around. - Michael? - Oh no, what are you doing? - Why do even you wear this sporty shit? I'm trying to find something to wear. - Oh no you don't, not with my clothes. You are not wearing-- - Gimme that! - Get outta this closet now! - No, you bitch. - Put this dress down! Get outta the closet! You're destroying my marriage! Get out! (Lily gasping) Get out right now! - Bitch! What are you, jealous of me? Nobody tells me what to do. Isaac! (sinister music) (fist thudding) (Annie screaming) - Ow. Please, no. Please don't hurt me, no please no! (fist thudding) (Annie weeping) Please don't hurt me. Sofia! Open the door! - Oh Annie, thank God. What's wrong? - Look what he did to me. - Oh my God, oh my God. Okay, what happened? - Isaac. I can't live like this. - I know you can't, sweetheart. I'm so sorry. Okay, where's Michael now? - I don't know. (weeps) - Okay shh, come in. Come in, come on. Come on in, sweetheart. Oh God, Annie! - So let me ask you this, do you have any plans for later on tonight? - No, do you have any plans? - Actually, no I don't. But I could think of a few, that's for sure. - Well why don't you start by buying me another drink? (light rock music) - Bartender, a Mai Tai for this absolutely gorgeous creature, please. - Comin' right up, sexy. - Wait a minute. Why am I the only woman in this place? - (laughs) You're a trip, you know that? Really, you're a trip. - This one's on the house. - Cheers. (glasses clinking) - I feel really uncomfortable. - What? Hey! Wait a minute. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute. (lips smacking) - Hey, I didn't say all the drinks were on the house. Jesus Christ, you give 'em an inch and they take a fuckin' mile. - Hey, I am going to fucking kill you! (fist thudding) (Isaac grunting) Get the fuck down there! Fuck you, huh! Fucking faggot! Fucking kill you! (grunts) Suck on that, you fuckin' cocksucker! - Stop it. - Freeze! Don't you move, you son of a bitch! Put your hands up now! Put 'em up where I can see 'em. (cop mumbling) - The fuck are you gonna do to me, huh? Yeah. - Hands where I can see 'em! - The fuck are you gonna do to me, huh? (cop breathing heavily) Fuck off. (foreboding music) Sir, are you okay? Sir, can you hear me? Don't worry sir, I'm gonna get you some help. Don't move, don't move, don't move. You've lost a lot of blood. - Isaac, what did you do? What did you do to him? - What were you doing with that man? - It's none of your-- (Lily screaming) - What were you doing with him? - I'm gonna tell Michael what you're doing to me! Let go of me! - Yeah? Tell Michael, you bitch! - Let go of me. - I will tell Michael that you are fucking another man! You fucking slut! (Lily screaming) (phone dialing) - Annie, it's Sofia. Sweetheart, where are you? Please answer your phone. (sighs) (muffled crosstalk) Michael? Where have you been? - I don't know (mumbles). Michael, Isaac is out of control. Get in the car. Get in the car. Come on Michael, let's go inside. - I want you to do me a favor. I want you to go out this door and don't let Isaac in the house. No matter what, you understand? No matter what. - You got it, son. - [Josh] What's going on now? - I'm talking to your father alone. - Oh my God, what happened to your face mom? - Nothing Josh, I'm fine. - Here, now have a seat. There you go. Have a seat. What are you lookin' at? (soft entrancing music) - Nothin'. - Okay, how are you feeling? - (exhales) Tired. - Why did you ask your father, Lou, to guard the door? - I don't want Isaac coming into my house anymore. - And what is Lou goin' to do? - Help, help, help! No, no, no. - Isaac, get outta here. - The fuck are you? - I'm Michael's father. - (laughs) Oh, is that so? Well Scarlet told me all about you. Get the fuck outta here, old man! - I'm here to protect my son. - Well it's too late for that. (ominous music) (laughs) You fucking kidding me right now? You think I'm gonna let you just cut me? - Isaac, I said get out. - I will fucking kill you. (grunts) (Isaac wincing) - Michael, what do you keep looking at? - Michael, it's Isaac. He's angry and he tried to kill me. - Lily, get out of here. - [Michael] No, no, she can't leave. Lily can't leave. - You want her here? - Michael. I love you, Michael. - What about Annie? She's your wife now and she loves you. - God, I know I know I know I know I know. I can't let Lily go. I just can't. - Thank you, Michael. Thank you. Don't ever let me go. - Your wife and your son are downstairs right now and they love you. So don't do this, Michael. - I love you too, Michael. You know that, don't you? - Not the way Annie loves you. Lily never loved you as much as Annie loves you. That's what you know, Michael. So get her outta your life. Get them all out of your life. They're destroying your marriage. They're destroying your life. (Michael weeping) - Madeline, look what a mess you made. You take the cake for the world worst mother, dumb woman! If you needed more sex, I was right there! Why, why the boy? Poor little Michael. Now he got all this crazy fucker running around and I have to be here because of you to get the best! Oh, sweet Annie. She doesn't deserve this and I shouldn't be here either! Sofia is right. - Michael please, don't listen to Sofia. I love you. You can't let me go. - Oh God, I don't know what to do! - Cry me a fuckin' river. - Isaac! - Shut up! Shut the fuck up! - (gasps) Isaac, what are you going to do to me? - I'll tell you what I'm gonna do to you, you sick bitch. I'm gonna blow your fuckin' head off! - Isaac, let her go. - No! I know what she's tryin' to do. Tryin' to convince you to get me outta here, right? Right, Michael? Well I'm not goin' anywhere! - Isaac, what do you want us all to do? - Didn't you hear what I said? All of you, you're all gonna get the fuck out! Tryin' to get me out? No, this is my house. You hear me? This is my life now! - Yes Isaac, I hear you. We all hear you and we're all going to leave if you just let me go, please. - No, get rid of him Michael. You don't want him here. - You fuckin' stay out of this, old man! You stay out! - I said let her go! (eerie music) (gun blasting) (Lily wincing) - No, Lily! God! Oh my God, Lily. Lily, oh no. (Lily groaning) No don't die on me. Oh God, Lily don't. Please don't go. Please don't leave me. Please. Please don't leave me. - Son of a bitch! (ominous music) (Isaac grunting) (Isaac wincing) (blood spurting) - Oh God, Lily please don't go. Please, please don't leave me. Please, please, please don't. - I love you. (pants) - Please, you can't leave me. (Lily wincing) - Listen to your father. It's too late. - I love you, Lily. I love you, Lily. Don't leave me. Don't leave me, please. - We had our days. I love you, Michael. - She's not gonna make it. - Yes she is, don't say that. Don't fuckin' say that. (Lily mumbling) Annie is your wife now. I can't stay. (weeps) I gotta go. (Lily mumbling) - Don't, no. (weeps) Oh God. - It's so peaceful. - You're gonna be alright. - It is so peaceful. - (weeps) No, don't leave me. Don't leave. You can't leave me. Please, please, Lily. Please stay, please stay with me. I love you. - Jesse, what are you afraid of? - I don't know. (ominous music) - Michael doesn't need you anymore. (gun blasting) (soft, somber music) - (gasps) What are you doin' here? - Your mother's loss is my loss too, Michael. - (chuckles) What? You never loved her. Just get outta here, huh? I have a family emergency. I'm gonna have to call off this meeting. I'm sorry. - No, let us continue this meeting now. - I said, no! I can do it. Just leave me the fuck alone and get outta my life! You hear me? Get out of my life! Get outta my car! Get outta my car! I want you outta my car! - [Sofia] Oh they're simple questions, Jesse. - Like what? - {Sofia] Well, I wanna know when you plan on leaving. - No, I can't leave. I can't, Michael needs me. - I said get outta my closet! - What do you doin'? You crazy! - You're ruining my marriage. Get out! - You stupid bitch! - Get outta here! Get outta my life! - What are you, jealous? - Shut up, shut the fuck up! - Isaac, what are you going to do to me? - I'll tell you what I'm gonna do to you, you sick bitch. I'm gonna blow your fuckin' head off! - [Sofia] Michael? - Sofia. - How do you feel? - Something happened last night. - [Sofia] What happened? - I can't... I don't remember. - It's okay, Michael. They're all gone. It's all gonna be alright. Baby. Son. You're alive. (Michael mumbling) - [Sofia] You're home, Michael. - I am. - You're finally home. - I love you. - I love you too. Oh boy. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you. - It's only our first meal here (mumbles). Anyway, the doggie says to the zebra, right. He says, he goes up. He doesn't speak English and everybody... (mumbles) okay and everybody. We don't like paper plates and 89 cent Chianti. (muffled crosstalk) You like it? - It's not even. - (mumbles) like it, but at least we have a nice house. At least we have a nice house, yes? - Let's make a toast to the... Your house is absolutely gorgeous. - Thank you, Roger. - Very gorgeous. - Honey, I'm gonna go and check on Sofia, okay? - Okay, baby. - Okay, be right back. Sofia? - Hey. - You doin' alright? Yeah, I'm doin' great. - Good. - Michael's co-worker is right. Your house is perfect. - Well thank you. I've gotta say, Bernadette worked really hard to get us outta that other house and put us into this one. - Are you happy? - Very. - Good. I want you to know that I won't be seeing Michael anymore. - Really, why is that? - Well he's going to work tomorrow. He doesn't need me, wouldn't you say? - (sighs) Actually I have to say that I do agree. You're an incredible doctor. - No. - You really are. I wanna ask you something. Tell me, how did you do this? How did you get him out of this difficult period? - Michael's childhood tragedy, the molestation, it brought forth all these multiple personalities. But the thing is, every single alter ego had a purpose for being here. Like Lou, he was his protection. The gatekeeper as it were. Lily, she was the affection that he yearned for. In his heart, he felt like he had unfinished business with Lily, his deceased wife. So he brought her back. Then there was Jesse. Poor little Jesse. This timid and scared little boy inside of Michael. Then there was Isaac. - [Annie] Oh, that was horrible. - Isaac was the one who made him feel strong and in control, intimidating. Once he realized that he didn't need all these personalities to complete him, the part of his mind that created them killed them off. - Wow. - And it was the love that he had for his family that helped him do that. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - You brought my husband back to me. - I'm very proud of Michael. - Aww, thank you. - Michael, I'm here 'cause I love you. I'm very sorry about what happened to you as a kid. - So am I. But that means a lot to me. - You got it. - Thanks. Hey chief, I wanna show you something. - He's one of us. - Hey sports fan, stand up. - Huh? - Come on, come on. (soft, somber music) (muffled conversation) (Myra laughing) Good talk, you can talk (mumbles). - You sure can. - Thanks for your help today, Myra. - You're very welcome. - Alright. - Have a good night, Mr Foster. - I'll see ya tomorrow. - Okay. (elevator dinging) - Hold the elevator, please. Hold up. Thank you. That's you, wasn't it? - What? - My special friend from the bar. - I don't know what you're talkin' about. - This may seem a little crazy to you, but besides bashing my head up against a brick building and scarring me for life, you did something to me. (rhythmic pop music) Yeah, I can't stop thinking about you. Okay wait a minute, look look. I would like you to know if you wanted to get together again and not be so rough this time, I would really like to see you. - I'm happily married. - (chuckles) Come on, aren't we all? - No. Naw. (dark rhythmic music) (ominous rhythmic music) (soft synthesizer music)
