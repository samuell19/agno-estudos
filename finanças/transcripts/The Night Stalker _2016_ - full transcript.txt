I'm Kit. That for Katherine? Yeah. Mind if I record this? It depends what we talk about. I used to live in Glassell Park. Oh, yeah? What street? Verdugo. Off Eagle Rock. Good memory. No new memories in here to replace the old. ( coughing ) ( coughing ) Are you sick? Always. ( clears throat ) You're a lawyer, right? How old are you? Forty-three. I like your legs. Maybe lift your skirt up so I can get a better look? That's not why I'm here. Oh, yeah? Then why are you here dressed like that? I'm interested in you. "Interested" like I'm a zoo animal you want to study, or like a zoo animal you want to get bent over a table by? "Interested" like... I want to understand you. You see those other women out there waiting, waiting to see me? They want to understand me. They don't. You won't either. At least they give me something I can use. So those women that come here to visit you are attracted to you? Is that so hard to believe? Yes, actually. You gonna insult me now? I mean, given your history with women. Alleged history. ( sighs ) Some women like that... my alleged history. So, what are you gonna give me? What do you need? To talk without this. I've been here 23 years. Solitary for 10. The only people I ever get to smell are the guards, and they don't smell so good, you know? I never get to touch anyone. You're not gonna get to touch me either, Richard. We'll see about that. GUARD: Time's up. You come back here, don't wear that. Gold is the metal of Christianity. It's not permitted in my presence. See you later, Katherine!

Now, you came to us with this theory on Ramirez. You convinced us, we flew you out there to get a confession that you assured us you could get. This is gonna come down to you.

She wrote for the papers, and she'd write articles about how messed up the whole thing was, how I'd never get a fair shake because my picture was on every channel saying I did it. Hmm. She always believed I was innocent. Were you? I don't believe in innocence. I think Satan was always inside me. Tell me what you were like as a child. Satan is a stabilizing force in my life. Satanists need to have more faith than Christians, because Christ was seen and felt. Lucifer has never felt the need to be seen, but in everyone's soul, he can be felt. Well, if he can be felt in everyone's soul, then why doesn't everyone believe in him? Because people don't want to know what's truly in their souls.

What else did you read about me in your Night Stalker book? I read that you spent a lot of time with your cousin, Mike. Yeah. I hung out with Mike a lot. He taught me how to hunt, to sneak up on an animal with stealth, or to shoot or stab it for the quickest death. Where is that? With a gun in the head, right above the ear. With a knife, across the throat. You drive the point into the side of the neck, and you pull it across. Cuts both the windpipe and the arteries. Always lethal.

KIT: Did you start stealing to give her gifts? RAMIREZ: I stole because I was good at it. My brothers used to call me "dedos", fingers, 'cause I could lift anything.

I'm trying to give you a chance to set the record straight. What's out there right now? Speculation, crime-scene photos, victims' stories. No one knows your side of it. Don't you want them to?

Why that person? Why that night? That old lady in your neighborhood. Not the first one you were convicted of, the first. It was her. Let's go back to El Paso. You started working in that motel. KIT: They gave you a passkey? RAMIREZ: So we could let people in their rooms. KIT: But you did more than that, right? RAMIREZ: I'm surprised more people don't. Half the time, they didn't even notice anything was gone. KIT: Seems like a good gig for you. RAMIREZ: Yeah, that passkey came in handy a few times. ( gasps, screams ) Some husband came in and beat the crap out of me. They call the cops? No. They left town without pressing charges. What happened to your passkey... Let's talk about you for a minute. Oh. Remember? You're real with me, I'm real with you? Go ahead. So you're a lawyer, right? I am. How did you go to school? Glassell Park wasn't rich. Believe me, I robbed from those places. They didn't have jack. I worked my way through school. Where did you work? At a fetish club. Now we're getting somewhere. Doing what? B.D.S.M. role play. What the hell is that? It can be a lot of things. You play the part the client wants. You have sex with them? No, never. You make a lot of money? Yes. You ever still do it? No. I knew there was something about you. Okay. My turn again. I bet you used to fantasize about me, huh? Don't feel bad about it. Sometimes we want things that society shames us for. Don't do that. What? Pair us off. Compare our secrets. It's a matter of degrees. We are a product of our times, and these are bloodthirsty times. That's a scripted answer. I've read that before. You want a different answer, ask a new question. Okay. You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm here because there's another man on death row. In Texas. Harrison Johnson. He's set to die for murders I don't think he committed, for murders I think you committed. When? January 1978. A mother and a son. Naoki and Yuko Kamori. What kind of names are those? Japanese. Let me guess. They were killed at the motel where I worked. Don't get all excited. Do you think I haven't been paying attention? You just asked me about the passkey. Well? So you came up here to get me to cop to some old murders in Texas? So... Johnson can get a stay. Because he's innocent? You tell me. ( exhales sharply ) He can't have been in jail since '78. Texas doesn't take as long as California to kill off their criminals. He got arrested in '08. So why do they think he did these old murders? He got picked up a few times for vagrancy and small crimes in El Paso around the same time. He hung around the motel, I guess. What did he look like? Uh, back then he was skinny. Light-skinned African American. Scar on his neck? Yeah. I remember that guy. He used to try to take showers in the rooms, steal coffee from the lobby. ( coughing ) Well, he eventually got arrested for beating a guy in a bar who turned out to be related to a congressman. The guy fell back and hit his head on a broken barstool. He died from the contusion. The prosecutor was a friend of the congressman. He dug up this cold case and drew a connection. He wanted the death penalty, and he got it. So he was beating some guy in a bar? Doesn't sound so innocent to me. They didn't have enough evidence to convict him. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. ( sighs ) Do you ever worry you're on the wrong side? Am I on the wrong side, Richard? You lawyers, you have to be so sure about everything. You, with this. You read some files and made a decision... he's innocent... for something that happened so many years ago. I mean I just don't see how you can be so sure. The pieces of evidence tell a story. And when I read that story, it was awfully familiar. KIT: The son was stabbed. The mother was cuffed, finger cuffs, and raped. And then, stabbed also. The knife was driven into the side of the neck and then dragged straight across, severing both the windpipe and the arteries. Frankly, it reads like a sloppier, less practiced version of you. And you would know, I guess. Yeah. It wasn't me. I don't believe you. I don't care what you believe. I know you want your little theory to be true, you want to be on the right side, but sometimes you don't get to know if you're on the right side or not. Uh... Do you think you're evil, Katherine? I think you are. Everyone has good and evil in them. Personally, I'd like to be 100% evil, but I can't. I'm too easygoing sometimes. Everyone has hate and anger. Some people can cope with it. I can't. My hate and anger grow to a level that I can't live comfortably with it. When that happens, I have to act on it. Richard, did you act on it in the motel in 1978? What do you do with your hate and anger? Did you ever want to act on it? To kill someone? This is the problem with you. I don't care about you. You give me no reason to. And I bet you don't give anyone else a reason either. Maybe that's why you're all alone. Maybe it has nothing to do with choice. Maybe you spend so much of your life hiding who you really are that you ended up being no one. Get him out! Get him outside! ( door shuts ) GUARD: You all right?
