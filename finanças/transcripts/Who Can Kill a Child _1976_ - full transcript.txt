The Soviet army completes the evacuation of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Before fleeing, the S.S. attempted to execute all of the prisoners who had witnessed their crimes. Toward the end, corpses were being burned right out in the open since there weren't enough ovens. The neighboring Polish people were invited in to witness what was going on behind the barbed wire fences. The prisoners had been tattooed for later identification. Some were used in laboratory experiments, such as the removal of limbs, inoculation of viruses, implantation of cancer cells and skin grafts. Many times children were used in these experiments. This footage shows a trepanning designed to cause a complete and irreversible disturbance of the patient's nervous system. These images, filmed by the cameras of the S.S., show family members bringing their dead to mass graves. Bulldozers were necessary due to the massive number of corpses. According to documents seized from Auschwitz authorities, close to 100,000 prisoners perished in the camps. 40,000 were children under the age of 14. At the time the camp was liberated, 2,385 children were found still alive, most weakened by tuberculosis or acute anemia caused by malnutrition and a lack of medical care. More than one million deaths resulted from the war between lndia and Pakistan. Not all of the deaths however were casualties of war. A large refugee population was driven into settlement camps where the weakest died from lack of food and water. These images show the trucks that arrived daily to transport the corpses of the elderly and the children to mass graves. Every year, the aid provided to lndia and Pakistan by the United Nations remains insufficient. UNlCEF claims that a child dies every five seconds in this part of the world. After more than 3 years of combat, the armistice that ended the Korean War is signed on July 24th. Along with peace, the children of South Korea found shelter and food thanks toAmerican charity organizations and the aid of the government in Washington which built rehabilitation centers in the suburbs of Seoul. In these centers, the children were fed, medically treated and rehabilitated on both a physical and mental level. Innocent victims are taught to fend for themselves & to learn how to play sports. With the war over and thanks to the humanitarian aid, tens of thousands of orphans have learned to regard peace optimistically. War continues along the lndo-Chinese peninsula. In many of the large cities of South Vietnam, there are anti-government demonstrations. Grenades explode in the streets, killing both men and children. The United States army sends in almost a half-million soldiers who, aided by their modern weaponry, hope to bring peace to Southeast Asia. U.S. planes bomb military targets daily. Sometimes, as seen in these images, the bombing affects the civilian population. In the village of Tuyen Hoa, hundreds of women & children are killed or severely burned by napalm bombardments. The Nigerian civil war has wreaked havoc for two years. The southern tribes have finished surrounding the area of Biafra which had been hardest hit by the conflict. The people are fleeing to the north, trying to find refuge in makeshift camps. But in the camps, death lies in wait for the weakest and the most innocent, because of the lack of food and medical supplies. Elsewhere, due to changes in climate, a six-month drought takes other victims in Mali, Mauritania and Chad. More than 11 million humans will be threatened with death from famine or thirst. Aid received is insufficient & the need for food and medical supplies is urgent. As always, those most heavily affected by these tragedies are the children. The lnternational Red Cross estimates that up until now, 300,000 children have died from hunger, dehydration and sickness. Doesn't look like she drowned. No. Look at this... She has a knife wound. And four more on her stomach. She looks like a foreigner. It looks like she was thrown off a boat, and the tide carried her onto the beach. Look, there are more wounds on her thigh. Whoever did this was sick in the head. Wake up! Benavis! Excuse me, but what's going on? It's the annual Fiesta of Benavis. Damn, we need film for the camera! Yes, but first we need a hotel. Yeah, let's go. Sir, excuse me. Would it be possible to get a room, just for a few hours? I'm very sorry, sir, madam. At this time of the year, all of the rooms are reserved well in advance. Reserved? Yes sir, all of the hotels here are completely full. All of them? Yes, but I can give you an address. It's a house owned by a woman I know Sometimes she has rooms available. It's in the old quarter of the city. Tell her I sent you. I'm sure you will like her, she's very friendly. Thank you. Goodbye Is it nearby? Yes. Thanks. This is the only room I have. Oh, it's fine. It's a bit noisy, but the room has good lighting. The bathroom's down at the end of the hall. Will you be staying for some time? Only 15 days. Here in Benavis? No, we just came here to rest up. There are too many tourists here. Where are you going then? The island ofAlmandora. Where? The island ofAlmandora. Oh, you mean Almanzora. Oh, it's pronounced Almanzora? We are right here....in Benavis. Almanzora is right around here. If you're looking for peace and quiet, you'll find it onAlmanzora. Very few tourists ever go to the island. It takes about 4 hours to get there by boat. Yes, i've been to Almanzora before. I went there on a vacation eleven years ago. Can you tell where I can rent a boat? Rent? Yes, I want to rent a boat. There's a fisherman who handles the mail going to the island. He goes there twice a week to bring and pick up the mail. I would prefer to have my own boat and not have to rely on anyone else. To travel and to go fishing.... Go down to the port and ask for Enrique Amors. He's the guy who takes care of the mail, & he also has boats to rent to tourists. oh good. Amors.... Is your wife going with you? Yes. Why? I just asked because there are no doctors on Almanzora. Don't worry. I'm almost a doctor. I'm a professor of Biology. Then there's no problem. Would you like a map? Yes, thanks. I think Benavis is beautiful. Yes, but I prefer Almanzora. I like Benavis. There's too many people here. To get to the water, you have to climb over all the people laying in the sand. Let me take a picture of you. Sit there. Perfect! Stand like this? Oh no, we forgot to buy the film! How may I help you? Good afternoon. I need six rolls of film for my camera. -Color? -Yes. Tom. What's this about? In spite of their suicidal sacrifice, the demonstrators' protests have been futile. Together with the remnants of the Thai army, the civilian population flees toward the port of Phuket in an attempt to reach the American naval ships on which they will be transported to the Phillipines. Although Bangkok's defenses have collapsed, they have managed to establish an air strip to evacuate the capitol where chaos reigns. Corpses have been piling up while UNICEF and the International Red Cross request aid for the more than 30,000 orphaned and injured children. With the fall of Thailand, it is obvious that.... You said six rolls, right? Yes. The whole world is crazy. In the end, the ones who always suffer the most are the children. From War? The children! From Famine? The children! He's right. How horrible! Yes. 30,000 they said? That'll be 1,032 pesetos. What a nice day to take pictures! Evie? Where are you going? I want you to take a picture of my first swim in Benaviz. It's so warm. What did you say? Never mind. What's happening? I don't know. Are you happy? Are you HAPPY? From their pallor, they sure don't look like sunbathers. They go to the beach at night. Do you want to sit down for awhile? Where? There are too many people here! Yeah, especially since now you count as two. What are you thinking about? Nothing. What are you thinking about? Nothing I was just looking at the sea. -Almandora is -- -Alman-zora, you mean? It's right out there on the horizon. And what else? What else were you thinking about? Well.... I was thinking about the conversation we had with the camera shop owner. According to him, the world has gone insane, and those who suffer the most are always the children. Now that Thailand has fallen, all of Asia is headed for Communism. War breaks out in China following the death of Mao. But there's no war here in Benavis... That's true, but there was a civil war once in Benavis, and it could happen again some day. Do you remember La Dolce Vita? La Dolce Vita? It's a very famous old ltalian film. There is a character of a man who is very nice, quiet, has two kids, loves his wife. he lives his life as if he hasn't a problem in the world. Suddenly one night, he takes a gun and kills his two children and then commits suicide. Why? I imagine he was trying to save them from the world that was waiting for them. Do you want to kill it? We already have two kids. We can handle three. And thanks to him, I'll get to see Almanzora. Do you regret it? No, not at all. So he brought himself to kill his children... just to protect them from the world we have created? What was the director's name? An ltalian of course. A fascist just like Mussolini. They're all crazy. What was that? More fireworks. You were right. About what? Almanzora will be much nicer. Everything's so crowded here and it's way too noisy. Too crowded... much too crowded... TWO CORPSES WASH UP ON BEACH They just put in this motor two days ago. Do you know how to get there? Yes. Ask him if we're going to be able to find lodging on the island. Please tell me. Will we be able to find a hotel onAlmanzora? There's a boarding house there. If you had been to the island before, you would know that. It's called the Pensione Estrella. Since there aren't many tourists there, it's always half empty. Hand me that suitcase. Give me your hand, miss? No, not here. You sit up front. Why? What's the difference? Your husband will sit back here to steer the boat. Up there? Ok, no problem. Are you sure you can handle this motor? Oh, sure, don't worry about it. Tell Cesareo that I already received the cases of beer. Cesareo? Yes, the guy in the bar? Oh never mind, I'll see him tomorrow when I bring the mail over to Almanzora. The sea is calm, so you should get there in about four hours. See you later! Have a good trip! We'll see you in fifteen days. Don't you know he's the mailman for the island? We'll be seeing him tomorrow. Until tomorrow then! I'm sorry I can't go for a swim. Try splashing some water on your face. It's not the same thing. The water's so clear. I can see everything! Look! A flower! It must have come from Almanzora. Almanzora? The current's so strong, it often brings all kinds of stuff from the island, Iike leaves and plants, to the beach at Benavis. We're going to have such a good time here! Look! There it is. It's really quiet. How can you tell? Long after we left Benavis, I could still hear the crowds on the beach. Now as we get nearer to the island, I can't hear a thing but the wind. Let's give them a hand. Be careful, don't hit the boat. Give me a hand. Thanks, kids. Let's go in the water. I'm coming! Let's go, Manolo! Hi there, what are you trying to catch? Tell me. What are you fishing for? What are you using for bait? Come on, Tom. Can we go now? It's so hot. I should've brought a hat. We can buy you one here. Listen. To what? Nothing... ...only the sea, the wind, the sea gulls.... And the sun! It's terrible! I love those arches! Madam, allow me to present the Plaza Mayor. What a pleasure! There's the coffee shop.... and the customs office. Nothing's changed in eleven years. Tom, what's that over there? Where? It's an ice cream cart. Go buy me one. Excuse me. Anybody here? There's nobody there. It doesn't matter. We can serve ourselves and just leave the money on top. It's all melted! There's a bar. There's nobody in here either. It looks like they all left in a hurry. It's strange.... What? Nobody's been here for awhile. What do you mean? This thing looks like it's been going for hours. Tom, I'm dying of thirst and I'm hungry! Let's see what they got here. There's plenty to drink. Coca Cola.....cold beer. And to eat? All I see is sugar and some burnt chickens. Ahh, I think there used to be a little grocery store... ... just around the corner. Are you coming? No, not me. It's hot and i'm tired. I'll wait here for you. I'll be right back. Hi, come on in. What's your name? What's your name? Come on, tell me. What's your name? Lourdes. I'm pregnant, see? Why are you doing that? Some day you'll have a baby too. Please stay here? Please come back? Hello? Did you see anyone there? But Tom, it's not possible. This place is rather unique, you know. Whenever there's a fiesta, all people leave and go to the other side of the island. How about you? What about me? Did you see anyone? Yes, I did. A little girl, but she ran away. This is all I could find. Bread, sausages, fruit, sardines..... and a hat for you..... and a doll for Rosie. Do you like it? What are we going to do, Tom? First we'll have a bite to eat, and then we'll go look for our hotel. Please come here. Come here! Hold it.....don't go. Don't go! There has to be people on the island because if there are children here, then that means..... Who turned the electricity off? The rotisserie stopped. I did it. What i'm afraid of is...... Our first meal on Almanzora! We have everything we need.... plates, utensils.... If you would kindly follow me, madam. Right this way. Please have a seat. I'll be your chef...... and your waiter too. Fine napkins and... It rang a few minutes ago. I picked it up, but there was no one on the line. Hello? Hello? I can't understand you. What did you say? Please speak English. I can't understand what you're saying. Please speak louder, in English or Spanish? Hello? Hello? Who was it? I don't know, but it sounded like a child. What language? German, Dutch...maybe Swedish. I really couldn't tell. Tom, you told me there were no telephones on the island. There wasn't a direct line to the continent. Since that time, they must have installed a local system. At least now we know we're not the only people on the island. Was it the same voice? Yes. How many people live on this island? I don't know. Maybe 100.....200. When do they leave for their fiesta, do you remember? Did they always leave the village this deserted? It's possible, but I went with them so I didn't stay to see. They were really great fiestas. Everyone would bring their guitar. They would sing songs and set off fireworks. What are you looking at? Nothing. Tom, isn't this the place? Yeah. Let's go inside. It's not possible that there is no one in this entire village. What are we going to do? We wait. At least it's nice and cool here. Someone will come. Is there a shower around here? What did you say? I'm so tired and I smell like sweat. What I would give for a shower! Look, Evie. There are other tourists on the island. Are they British? German They're a married couple with a daughter. Do you think it was German? Who? The voice on the phone. You said the voice sounded very young and that she might have been German. Where are you going? The keys to Rooms 6 and 7 are missing. I'm going to check up there. Tom, come here! Look! I knew the village couldn't be completely abandoned. I don't see anyone. There was someone. I saw an old man cross the street. He's still there on the corner. Look, down at the very end of the street. You can see his cane. Ok, i'll go and see. Look, a little girl! Tom, what is she doing? Why? Why did you do that? Why did you do that? Why?? Tell me why you did it? Why?? Come back. Come back here! What happened to that old man? Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? Nothing. Tom, what happened? Listen, the little girl, with the cane... she was playing with the old man. Then accidentally, she.... What are you talking about? I saw her beat the old man. I swear to you, she was only playing. It's the truth. You're lying! Why the hell would you lie to me? I saw you carrying his body. What happened? She hit him, and he was hurt pretty bad. Why didn't you bring him back here? I took him home to his house. You're lying. Listen, I'm telling you the truth! I brought him home to his house. It was right there on the corner. I saw her beat that old man. Then I saw you carrying him in your arms. Where did the little girl go? I left them both there together. Please, Tom, stop lying to me! She hit him with the cane accidentally, and his forehead was bleeding. It was an accident......nothing more. Honey, in your condition, you really shouldn't be getting upset. There are some strange things happening on this island, and I feel as if you're doing everything you can to hide them from me. If something bad is happening here, whatever it is we should leave right away Hello? Hello? Please speak slowly and louder. Are you Mrs. Brit Vandenholder? Don't go up there. Please don't go! They might be up in their room. -Stay back! -Who are you? Keep away! It's really hot outside. You should rest awhile. You're here on vacation, right? I'm going to talk to that man. What's happening on the island? I don't know. I don't know. Please, relax. Feel better now? What is happening on Almanzora? The night before last... it was around 11 :30. Suddenly we heard voices and children laughing. Laughing? Yes, it was as if every boy and girl in the village all woke up at the same time. They were all screaming and laughing. They split up into small groups. They went into people's houses as if it was a party.... but no.... because as soon as they went inside, we'd hear men and women screaming. screams from men and women! Then they'd come out laughing and go into the next house... and the next...and the next! My wife went down to see what was going on, while I stayed at the window She was standing in the doorway, watching. A group of children came out of one of the houses toward her. I thought they were playing... but they had knives and clubs in their hands. I had a shotgun in my room, and I grabbed it... ...but I didn't do anything. No one in the village did a damn thing, do you understand? Because.... ...who can kill a child? I was afraid, so i hid in a tiny room in the attic. I could hear them looking for me. I was so afraid, until I heard your voices. I don't know anything more. Nothing else! How did you injure yourself? When I left my room, it was dark. I tripped and fell on the floor. Is it possible there are other people still alive on this island? No, I don't think so. There are a few fisherman up on the north shore, and a few farms in the middle of the island. Sounds like it's only happening on Almanzora. -Did you sleep well? -Yes. Hello? Where are you? Where are you? She was cut off. It's the girl. The girl from the room. Where can she be calling from? She might be using the village switchboard. Where's that? In the Post Office. Post Office? Yes, after you go out of the hotel, you make a left and it's about 300 meters away, on the first floor. Evie, you stay right here with him. I'm going to try to find her, and then I'll be right back. Sir, it is imperative that we leave here right away... all three of us and now! Believe me, Evelyn, we have to get out of this place! Why? Help me please? Aunt lsabel is sick. They're at grandma's house, and grandma is sick too! They can't breathe and I'm scared. The children hurt them bad. Come with me, Papa. Please stay here? She's my daughter. Let's go. Where are they going? Evelyn, you must do exactly as I tell you. Tom, what's going on? What were all those screams? Listen, the only way we can get out of here is to run. I know in your condition, you shouldn't be running, do you understand? Even when you have no strength left in your body, you must keep running till we get to the boat. We can't stop for anything, do you understand? I understand. Ok then.... Iet's go! No, Tom, I can't go on. Evie, get up and run! We can't stop now. We will not stop! Get up on your feet. We'll run together. I'll hold you. Let's go! We've got to run! Evie, try harder! Run, Evie! They're only children! Only kids! What did that man at the hotel say about all this? I don't know. Something strange has affected all the children on the island. What did he mean? I don't know. Some type of mass insanity. I don't understand it. Where are we going now? To the other side of the island, where the fishermen live. Hopefully we'll find a boat. What about all of the adults on Almanzora? Where are they, Tom? There's a boat. Why did you stop? There are some children down there. Tom, what is happening to the children? I don't know. It seems incredible, but they've all gone crazy. All this violence seems so unbelievable. I don't understand why they're attacking everyone. It's as if they feel we are their enemies. Maybe the children, out of sheer instinct, are just starting to... To what? Let's go. Did anything strange happen here last night? Last night? Are there any other people inside the house? Here now? Are there any other people living here? My mother and the children. Please, we need to hire a boat to get us to Benavis. Go to the town on the other side of the island. No, that's not possible. My husband and my brother-in-law have a fishing boat. Yes. Where are they now? They're out at sea. They should be back before sunset. That boat there's no good, it has a big hole in the bottom. Tom, I feel a bit faint. Ma'am, can we rest here for a little while? Yes, come in. Come inside. How many months is she? Six months. Your first child? No, we have two others back home. You don't look it. Drink this. You'll feel better. What is it? Don't worry. Just drink it. Why are you bothering those people? Oh, these children! Go down and play on the beach! They drive me crazy. Please forgive them. Are they all your children? Yes, all four of them. Let's go. We have to get out of here. Sir, wait! They'll be coming back very soon now. Sir!! Children, what did I say to you? Go and wash up! And you two, go on home now. Didn't you hear me? It's possible all of the kids from the village are coming this way. But Tom, we might..... We'll have to use the Jeep to drive across the town and get to the boat, no matter who gets in our way! No matter who? If any of the kids get in our way, I don't care what happens to them. What do you mean? We have to get to the boat! They're leaving. Until now, no one has dared to kill one of them. That's why they weren't afriaid. But they are now. Tomorrow morning, the man will come to the island with the mail, and maybe some other people will come with him. There's nobody outside. Calm down. Do those kids realize what they're doing? I don't know. A normal child is incapable of killing another human being. To tell you the truth, I thought I was incapable of it too, but now I've killed one of them. Try to relax. Calm down. Water? Evie, what is it? What's the matter with you? Help me. Please help me! I'm in pain! Something's hurting me bad. Don't get up. Lie down. No! Don't do that! No, Tom! No, the pain isn't the same... ...Iike when Richard and Rosie were born. Help me Tom. I'm in pain. Help me. Tom, touch it! Touch it with your hands. Do you feel it? There it is again. It's tearing me apart. Help me! That's not true. Relax, It's ripping and tearing at my stomach! Please no! It's tearing me apart That's not true. I feel it inside me. It's killing me! Do you hear them laughing? They're outside! They're laughing because they know that the child I'm carrying inside It's one of them. It's killing me! In that bar, a little girl came up to me... and touched me. I'm sorry ...she touched our baby! I'm sorry... ...where's Rosie? Where's Richard? It's them! It's them! It's them! Stop! Stop! It's them!! What has he done? Where are all the townspeople? Goodbye. Hi, how's it going? Are you going to the mainland? Why don't we all go? Because we'd attract too much attention in Benavis. Do you think the children there will start playing the way we do? Yes, of course. There are lots of children in the world. Lots of them
