Lady Barbara! - You wanted to see me, Ms. Mary. - Wait next door, I'll be right there. Sure. - Listen to me, Clark. - Tell me. You're very close to my cousin Barbara, right? Of course. Then be honest, what do you think about her strange behaviour? Why do you ask? Come on Clark, you've seen her walking around at night. It's true, but nothing bad has ever happened. So far, but tonight she was walking around with a loaded gun. Who does it belong to? If you really must know, it belongs to me. - You! - Surprised? Everyone in the castle knows that target practice is my favourite hobby. More than a habby, I'd call it an obssession. Keep it somewhere safer, where Barbara can't find it. But of course! I'll be more careful. Clark, tomorrow you'll take me to London to see Dr. Osborne. He's our family doctor. We'll talk to him. I'm sure he'll be able to cure her. - Is she asleep? - No, she's just shaken up. Then let's not disturb her. Are you coming, Clark? Barbara! Barbara, where are you? Barbara, is that you? Killer Without A Face' Cast... Barbara Macdonald The owner of the castle Walter Macdonald Barbara's husband John Brenton The architect Francis Barbara's friend Clark The administrator Mary Barbara's cousin Kate The first maid Betty The second maid Judith The governess The Mute Man employed to do heavy work How much time has passed since I left Nottingham castle? Three months? Six? A year? Who knows? Everything that happened before seems so distant. Such confused memories. It's almost as though it doesn't belong to my past anymore. To my existence. I know I was sick, very sick. But I'm sure this trip to Italy will help me recover. This miraculous land is a celebration of lights, harmonies, colours! My soul is reawakening. [ feel born again. My soul is finally free from the shadows of a night that seemed never-ending. It's great to be one of the crowd. To find yourself. Feeling the same things they do. Here you can re-live how the ancient factions settled their disputes It's a fascinating sight. Houses covered in flowers ready for a big party! And that dark tower that contrasts with the blue sky! That tower! That tower! - Looking for someone? - Exactly, nothing gets past you! Not even your sarcasm! There's an abundance of spirit here you'll find it hard to accomodate yours! That's a good one! If you had a beard I'd have mistaken you for George Bernard Shaw! - Your name? - Clark! - Mr. Brenton? I'm Mcdonald. - A pleasure. We'll go over the accounts tomorrow, Clark. As I thought. - I trust he was welcoming. - It depends an your point of view. Perhaps he doesn't know any better ways to receive guests. Yes, he isn't particulary sociable... but his other qualities render him bearable enough. He has helped me administer the castle for a number of years. But let's return to the task at hand. [ trust the terms of your contract are to your liking. I couldn't have asked for better. The opportunity to restore a castle like this is highly interesting. Proceed as you think best. As for the furnishings, you have carte-blanche. - There's ane thing I wanted to ask you. - Please, go on. - Well, what did you want to know? - You didn't know me personally... and it wouldn't have been hard to find another architect in London. So why choose me? Someone spoke very highly of your work to me. - Someone I know? - They seem ta know you very well. They're currently a guest in the castle. - Hi, John! - Francis! - Surprised? - Why [ haven't seen you for years! We were bath at university, [ was a freshman and you were a graduate. - Remember? - Those were the days! Sorry to interrupt but I have some urgent matters to deal with. - When do you wish to start? - Tomorrow, if that's okay. As you wish. I'll leave it up to you. Now come with me, my wife is anxious to meet you. Great! That's hilarious! - That's net all, listen to this... - Don't make me laugh anymore! It hurts! - Barbara, dear, this is... - It's okay, we already know each other. - You must be Brenton, the architect. - It's an honour. - If you don't mind. - Please, Please, take a seat. Clark has chosen a dangerous opponent in you. - I don't understand. - Why it's obvious. He's afraid you've come here to steal his role of Prince Charming! One doesn't steal such a role, one conquers it! Well said! Clark is right to worry. You're dangerous! Barbara! You're very excited, dear. Don't tire yourself, Did you hear? He forbids me from being in a good mood. Please, Barbara. I know, Walter, you keep reminding me. I must avoid getting excited and keep my mind clear. As though it were possible! - What do you think? - Actually... Be honest, you must find me a pathetic figure. Not at all! You surprise me. [ asked you to be honest, hoping you at least would tell me the truth. Why do you lie? Try to control yourself, dear. There's no need to be galant. Please be honest. You see, I... - For no reason? - Like that, for no reason. Now tell me, who would you choose? No, Mr. Brenton, forget it. It's too easy! My husband's left. Now let's start again. Instead of Clark, I'm there. - What would you do? - I'm sorry, Ms. Macdonald. Now it's my turn. Francis and I are on the tower. In that case I would have to let fate decide. [ don't see any other way, you're both equally attractive. You disappoint me, John. What about our friendship? He's trying to avoid compromising you. But take note that only you and I are left on the tower, - What would you do? - In principal I'm against suicide. But dealing with such a beautiful lady... This is where I wanted you. If there were three of us I'd understand you embarrassment... If only because of the presence of the third person. But in two, Mr. Brenton, just you and me... You're a liar! In that moment you wouldn't give one cent for my life! And I for mine! It would be a tremendous battle of brute strength and intelligence... and frankly I don't know which of the two would win, I wouldn't underestimate a woman wha's life is in danger. That's enough, Barbara. You must rest. Yes, let's go. The show's over. - Knight! - Lady. Strange creature. It's not often she's this happy. - What do you think? - [ have no idea. She's a delightful woman... but there's something strange, like there's something tormenting her. Please excuse me. Would you like some tea, sir? And her? Were you also in that cursed tower? Pardon, sir? It doesn't matter, Kate. Mr. Brenton was aluding to a game we were just playing. - Thanks, you may go. - As you wish. Francis, I'm very grateful you recommended me to Mr. Macdonald. Don't mention it. You've given me a real test of friendship. (cut) - I'll be your slave! - It's an idea, I'll think about it. What's going on? I hope I didn't frighten you. - [ thought you were... - What? It's late, I don't know what's come over me, goodnight! Goodnight. Forgive me, [ was forgetting to ask if you needed anything? - Thanks, if I do I'll ring the bell. - No one will come until tomorrow, You see at this hour everyone locks themselves in their room. - You should do the same. - What are you afraid of? Sometimes, during the night... Yes? You hear strange noises! - What kind of noises? - Actually... You should go to your room instead of keeping Mr. Brenton with your idle chatter. Yes, Ms. Judith. Thank you, Kate. - Forgive me. - There's no need. I know I shouldn't have scolded her in your presence. Indeed, you shouldn't have. Sorry, but I must forbid her from being too forward with the guests. Please inform me if she does it again. You see, she still doesn't know how to behave. - You're quite a strict governess. - Goodnight. Sweet dreams. Kate probably wanted to tell you about the strange things that happen here at night. Naturally, it's all the product of her imagination. It's a pity Judith didn't give her time to finish. - What did she say? - You can guess. Poor Kate! How can she put up with that witch? Judith is the most dreadful person ['ve ever met! She thinks everyone's against her. Don't be surprised if you see her wandering at night like a troubled soul. Really? How frightening! The castle must be pretty at night with all the blackbirds. I don't think the owls even notice them anymore. This place is fast turning into a museum! - What brought you here? - Barbara wanted me to keep her company. She had quite a traumatic experience recently. What happened? It was the death of her cousin who she was particularly close to. The poor woman fell from the castle rooftops. Then it isn't just Kate's imagination. I must say the atmosphere around here really is strange! I'm not surprised you've noticed. The usual superstitions. - I thought it was something like that. - They say mysterious things happen here. Terrifying scenes! Judith is convinced the castle doesn't appreciate my work! Judith is hung up on an old legend that goes back three centuries. Interesting! They say sir Cannigan, one of Barbara's ancestors... kidnapped a Macdonald he was in love with... but the Macdonalds caught him and, after unfairly accusing him of witchcraft... they burnt him alive. They also say the fire destroyed everything except his soul... which roams the land, thirsty for revenge! It's incredible how much an old superstition can influence people. Good morning, Mr. Brenton. [ see Francis is doing a good job of keeping you company. Sadly, I can't offer you the same kind of hospitality. Your presence alone is enough to absolve you of any obligations. - How do you feel, dear? - The usual exhaustion. - Have you slept? - Yes, deeply... but I don't feel rested at all. - John was discussing the restoration. - That's right. I wanted to discuss some ideas I have for your apartment... - but if you don't feel up to i? - Barbara, awake already? - My dear, think of your health. - My health? There are more than enough people thinking of it, so why should I? Be reasonable, I only want you to follow the doctor's advice. Very well, I will. Either you walk another mile from the castle or you'll have to stop. Barbara is resting. Sorry but I thought she was awake. That's right, she woke up at 4 but I sent her to bed again at 5. As usual, she's very weak. And what's worse, every day her health seems to be failing her. Barbara needs special attention, that medicine won't cure her, Mental illnesses aren't easy to cure, my dear Clark. She should be in a clinic. But Mr. Macdonald loves his wife too much to have the courage to do it. We must try to convince him that it's the only way to cure Barbara. Why won't you help me? Mr. Macdonald listens to you. Doctor Osborne might be more convincing than me... He's the best specialist in London, and he's a friend of the family. Doctor Osborne is too busy to come to the castle. It's up to us. Promise me you'll help. Okay, I'll try. Great! Now let's get ready for dinner. - Hungry? - Enough! Then let's hurry. - What are you doing? - Nothing! I was just tidying up. Rummaging through Mr. Macdonald's draws isn't part of your duties. - Go, they're waiting for dinner. - Right away, Mr. Clark. I don't think it pays to be a hero nowadays. Your reasoning is most amusing but I certainly can't approve. Or yours, Mr. Clark. This way you both exit the battle unscathed. Isn't that the best way? No, in medieval times your behaviour would have been considered unchivalrous. Excuse me, lady Macdonald, but what do you think we should do? Something very simple; put on some armour and fight to the death! - Here, in front of me! - Like King Arthur's knights? - Why not? - Most satisfying! - And the purpose? - Most noble... To determine which ane of you merits the title; Prince Charming! You don't need to joust to determine that nowadays... - Just take part in a modern re-enactment. - How horrible! Mr. Brenton, my ancestors are turning in their graves! [ get it, this all leads back to that famous tower. Always! It's getting late. You must be tired Mr. Brenton. - I won't deny it. - But you wanted to discuss your work. Barbara, please, you should already be in bed at this hour. Very well, it can wait until tomorrow. Remember, I want to see all the sketches, including the furnishings! - Understood? - Your collaboration will be precious! - You really think so? - I'm sure of it. Then let's see, I could work on the furnishings... - With you, of course. - Great! Come. I have some marvelous ideas. You must help me realise them! Each piece of furniture must be a sign of originality and good taste. We'll go to London. To the finest antiques dealers on Regents Street. How fantastic! We'll replace this insignificant piece of furniture with a renaissance bookcase. An Elizebethan bureau here. A Flemish mural on that wall. Now, let's see... There... Two ceramic vases on those shelves. Everything must be varied, authentic, beautiful! What do you think? It's going to be a pleasure working with you. I'm glad. Barbara! Now you're exaggerating. You're too tired. Please, Till tomorrow, then. Please excuse me! Who's there? - Have you seen Mr. Macdonald? - No, - Shall we see if he's in his room? - [ don't see why. Well I do. You surprise me, Mr. Brenton. Not as much as me. Don't pretend you haven't noticed anything. - Would you believe me if I said no? - Not for a moment. Then tell me why you want to see Mr. Macdonald? [ must. Come. - Sorry if I'm disturbing you. - Go on. You might consider me indesceet but I must ask you what happened? As you can see, I'm still shaken up. Unfortunately my heart can't cope with such violent emotions. Show some consideration, if that's possible. I'm sorry but this requires an explanation. You might be right, but I alsa can't find a reason... for what you're asking me. Now please, I'd like to rest. I hope I haven't tired you too much. - Is there anything [ can do? - Yes, stay a little longer. Goodnight, Mr. Brenton. - Where I can find Judith? - At this hour she's in her room. - That one? - Yes, why? - A moment ago it was empty. - You were mistaken. No, I'm sure of it. If you don't mind, I'd like you to check. I don't know why I should. However... Now dao you believe me? - What happened? - I'd like to know as well. - But calm down now. - How frightening! It's easy to get carried away in a place like this. - I'll take you to your room. - No, I'd rather go to the park. - The fresh air will do me good. - Yes, perhaps you're right. - Feeling better? - Yes, but perhaps you're tired? No, I'm not tired, and I'm curious to know what's going on? Screams in the night, and nobody heard a thing! Nobody! - It's a little cold. - Let's go back. - Not yet, I'll put something on. - Shall I go? No, wait here. I'll be right back. - Have you gone mad? - Let go! Drop the gun! Mr. Brenton, if you don't mind? I'm sorry to have caused that unfortunate incident between you and Clark... - but I couldn't have known. - You're not to blame. It was a misunderstanding. You must also forgive me for that painful scene I involved you in. If I knew why, perhaps I could count on your understanding. I don't know what's going on here... but you can not only count on my understanding... but also on my discretion. Thank you. Clark, come here. - What did he tell you? - Nothing that justifies his actions. What do you think? It reminds me too much of the tower game. Good morning, Barbara. Here I am, ready to leave. We should leave immediately, we have so much to do in London. London? Why are we geing to London? We decided last night. Don't you remember? - Last night? - Yes! You said you wanted to look for some antique furniture on Regent Street. Antique furniture? [ said that? Sure! And you were so enthusiastic about it... - that you got me excited as well. - You're talking nonsense. I never said anything of the sort. Why would I? - But I assure you... - Please don't insist. Listen... Where's Kate? It appears Kate left without telling anyone. No! I can't believe it! I'm telling you she's gone. But why? Why did she do it? She was a strange girl, and she was also a gossip. You would've had to fire her sooner or later. It's not true! She's a good girl. Polite, considerate... and she cared about me. Now Kate has left without saying a word. What have you done to her? There's only one reason; she couldn't put up with your hysterical fits. Her replacement arrives today. Damn it, you scared me! You could've warned me. Now I get it! Even if you can't tell me, I think I've understood that you're mute. But I want to make sure! So you can't talk but you can hear me, right? At least we can understand each cther, [ bet you've guessed who I am! It isn't hard to figure out, but I'll tell you anyway... I'm Betty, the new maid. But there's no point telling you, you can't... Who do I report to? The butler? The governess, then? What's she like? And what do you do? Well I hope you'll protect me! Let's go. Take me to the castle. Thanks! May I have your attention, Mr. Brenton? - Go on. - I'm very upset with you. - Why? - You cancelled our trip to London. Don't look at me like that. Explain yourself. I'm sorry, I didn't realise it was so late. I understand. You were so lost in your work that you forgot about me. You mustn't say that. It's the second time you've lied to me. But it wasn't a game today. How can I make it up to you? - Mr. Macdonald wishes to see you. - Excuse me. - Come forward. - Feeling better? Yes, enough. Have a seat. Something to drink? No thanks. Excuse me if I take advantage of your courtesy... to talk about things that don't concern you. I've trusted you since the first day I met you. A trust that you have repaid in full with your discretion... in circumstances which I shudder to think about. I don't see why it needs repeating. It's true, but it's about my wife. I'm sure you've noticed her abnormal behaviour... and perhaps you also wondered what might be causing it? [ assure you, you could never imagine a more desperate case. Barbara's mental condition is beyond any medical cure. Obssessive delirium. A psychotic condition that alternates between moments of lucidity and insanity. But that's not all. Sometimes the patient can be overcome by homicidal tendencies. - What are saying? - [ know what you're thinking. You're asking yourself if last night's events are connected to my wife's madness. I have no doubt in my mind. Barbara can do the most incredible things when she has an attack. But no matter what happens I'll never lock her in an asylum. Never! You're suffering a lot. I realise that. But you must do something to stop Barbara harming others and perhaps also herself. If you have any ideas, please help me. Barbara means everything to me. I couldn't live without her. - Do you understand? - I'll do what I can to help you... - but I don't see how I can help. - You can. Bullseye! What do you think, Clark? - Aren't I good? - Excellent! - You're much better than me. - But I've had mare practice... and I also know something you don't. You need to aim a little lower with the silencer. - Then let me try without. - No, you'll disturb Barbara. - Is that why you use i? - That's right! As soon as [ heard you speak I knew you were a fellow countryman. - Am I right? - Sorry to disappoint you. I studied in London but I'm Italian. From Naples. It's all the same! - Where are you from? - Montgomery. - A county of fine women! - Modestly! But they also say we're the smartest. I'm very sharp, nothing gets past me. Between you and me, can [ ask you a question? - Sure. - Haven't you noticed anything? - Noticed what? - What? Someone like you! - It seems almost impossible. - If I knew what you were talking about? You know! You only need to keep your eyes open to notice the strange goings on. Perhaps, but I think you know a lot more than me. - I think so! Shall I tell you? - As you wish. Okay. Anyway, I can trust you. Just now, when I went to water the plants in the greenhouse, I heard... Betty is more of a gossip than the others... - Sooner or later you'll have to fire her. - It's not true. Betty cares about me. She gives me strength... sits next to me at night, in silence, until I fall asleep. Now take your medicine. It's good for you. Walter, please, let me get some fresh air in the park. - No! - I feel better today. You know you must rest. - Are you sure that's what you heard? - Of course! Word for word! Don't tell another soul. Got it? Don't worry about that! - Okay, you can go. - Goodbye! You again! When will you stop scaring me? I'd like to know what you're doing here at this hour! How dare you! I didn't know you were so cheeky! Although to be honest I don't mind seeing your big round face! It's so strange here at night. Like a haunted house in a theme park! Can you explain those strange noises? It's easy for you to say [ shouldn't be scared, but I am! And if you must know, [ believe in the castle legend! Nobody can convince me that this place isn't haunted. No, this isn't the place for me. It's not just the fear, there are other things [ don't like... That Judith, she's been on my case from the moment we met. And that Francis, she's such a bother! But the one who worries me the most is lady Barbara. At first I thought she was crazy, but now... [ realise it's something else. Do you want me to tell you? Somone must have put a curse on her! You know what? I don't like cursed places. I'm handing in my notice and I'm leaving. Now gg, I want to sleep! Francis! - Nothing else? - Let me get over the shock. The shack? I hoped you would have felt something different. Who says I don't? One doesn't exclude the other. - That's better! - But... - What is it? - This sudden visit puzzles me. - Suspicious? - No, curious. If you had a good memory it would be easy to understand. At this point there are too many things [ have to remember. I'm starting to lose my way. [ told you why I wanted you here. Do need to repeat it? Don't you realise I love you! You see... the joke has gone on long enough. It would be better for both of us if we took some time out. I can't imagine... - You do want me. - [ can't hide anything from you. I knew you hadn't forgotten our time together at university. - What's going on? - Someone's in danger! Betty! Mary is far away. Kate isn't coming back... Betty! Come on, we can't leave her alone. Barbara, can you hear me? Brenton, I don't have the strength to tell you what just happened! - Out with it! - It's horrible! Unfortunately, what I was afraid of has happened. But believe me, Barbara isn't to blame. - She had no idea what she was doing. - Explain yourself! Come on, Mcdonald! - Three people have been killed tonight. - Tonight? No! - It's true. - My Gad! - And the proof is all against Barbara. - No! It's impossible! I also wish it wasn't so. Try questioning her. She might remember something. She won't understand in that state. I must give her a stimulant that will bring her back to her senses. Help me! Clark! What happened? Who was it? Listen to me! What are you doing there? Come closer. Why are you excluding me from your conversation? No, dear, we were looking for you. Where were you? But I've always been here! - Try to remember? - Me? What? Perhaps a name will help; Betty. - Betty? - Or Mute. Betty, Mute? Why about them? They're dead! Dead! - How? - Only you can tell us, Barbara. Blood! I kill. I killed without knowing! I kill the people who lave me! I'm a monster! Come with me, it's important! - Listen... - Judith! - Clark! - Clark, stay here, look after her. Get away! I have no right to live! I must diel I must diel Let go of me! I want to die! Hurry, Brenton! You must save her! Let go of me! Barbara! - Stop it! - Let go of mel - You must listen to me! - [ want to diel Stop it! You haven't killed anyone. You were the victim of a cruel deception! But now you'll know everything... Isn't that right, Mr. Mcdonald? Your diabolical plan has failed. You gambled on the same card too many times, and you lost! What are you talking about? Have you gone mad? Mad? No! You won't persuade them I've taken leave of my senses... - Unless you force me to take this! - Be careful, don't push me! You're the one who's insane, Mcdonald. This bottle doesn't contain any medicine. It's a drug that induces madness! - Don't deny it! - Enough of this nonsense! You used it to drive your wife insane. To make everyone think she was a psychopath, isn't that so? Enough, I say! It was you who killed them. Admit it! There's no way out. Judith isn't dead. Judith recognised you! - You tried to kill her! - You're crazy! You've even revealed your stupid plot of the fake suicide that... Yes, that's right! It's true. It was stronger than me! I had to kill. [ killed anyone who stood in the way between me and Francis! I couldn't stop myself anymore. I couldn't! But I won't stop now either! You'll die as well, Brenton! Murderer! You won't get away with it! You're responsible for this. You pushed him to do it, Francis. You wanted him all to yourself. - But you lost him! - Don't move! The tower game continues. It's just the three of us now. There's one too many. - Tell me, who would you throw down now? - Stop, Francis! No, Clark, don't be afraid. I know it's my turn. Farewell, John. The tower game is over. Where has my mind gone? It's like all my memories are coming back. Why? Why did I want to reawaken them? Perhaps I had to come here. To reinvigorate my soul. To face the truth one more time. What's going on? They pull and tug at each other! It's a real medieval tournament. What is respect for the rules of chivalry? Here, the passion changes to fury the power of real arrogance. But it's such an exciting battle! For the rest, it's no different to what man has always done. Also here, just like elsewhere, it's always the tower game that rules. All blows are allowed, all acts of bravery are tolerated. It's winning that counts! Subtitled by Herman's Hermits No Fixed Abode - May 2013
