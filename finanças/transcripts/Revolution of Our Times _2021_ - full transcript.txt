(To protect the characters in the film) (Masked interviewees' voices are altered with a special process) (Some of the interviewees have lost contact after the recording of their interview) (Thus, they are replaced by actors on screen) (1997, Britain formally transferred Hong Kong sovereignty to China) (The Sino-British Joint Declaration promises) (Hong Kong will pursue one country, two systems) (Apart from foreign and national defense affairs) (Hong Kong shall enjoy a high degree of autonomy) (2017, The Chinese Foreign Ministry: "The Sino-British Joint Declaration) (As an historical document, no longer has any practical significance) (And it is not at all binding) (For the Chinese Central Government's management over Hong Kong") (2019, The Hong Kong government amended the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance) (The whole city protested on June 9) (More than 1 million people rallied) (But the government insisted on passing the bill in Legco on June 12) (June 12, Outside the Hong Kong Legislative Council Building) Withdraw! June 12, around 7 am Someone called me "Wake Up! We've marched onto Harcourt Road!" Start so early? Hongkongers? Hey, over there, come over! Lam Cheuk-ting: Let's work hard Lam Cheuk-ting: Withdraw! (Withdraw!) Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, immediately raised a red flag Can Hongkongers be extradited To the Mainland at will for trials in the future? One country, two systems is Hong Kong's legal system Separated from the legal system in the Mainland If the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance is passed The legal systems of the two places would seem to be merged If the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance can be passed All Hong Kong people will lose their personal safety The real battlefield Not in the legislative council! Yes! Withdraw! (Withdraw!) Perhaps, we don't know. Maybe this is a tactic to buy time We'll find out We first started by getting a team of drivers To block the road and pretend to have an accident A few cars blocked the road Trying to impede police reinforcements We are drivers. I'm one of the coordinators It turns out that we can use our cars for a cause It's a great inspiration and motivation for me As a high school student I didn't really care about politics I first time I joined the rally was on June 12 Then suddenly, there was a voice behind me I turned around And saw a friend from the Umbrella Movement 5 years ago "You are here?" Suddenly, he gives me "that" pair of gloves from his backpack He asked me, “do you have it?“ then gives them to me That pair really were the same ones from 5 years ago So it turns out that we weren't chilling for 5 years We were just dormant Like a dormant volcano, it will erupt Everyone will come out again Hongkongers! (Add Oil!) June 12, when the tear gas was fired I didn't have any gear It was the first time I inhaled tear gas The police fired without raising the black flag My right eye was hit and I was bleeding I don't know what's going to happen to my eyesight (Do you know what kind of gun it was?) No, but it wasn't metal, more like a rubber bullet Many were scared. I came over and saw many kids There were children, elders, and ordinary citizens If they were your children coming out And I beat them repeatedly How would you feel? I don't want this to become the next June 4 Tiananmen Square! Stop throwing! Don't! (Fuck! They threw tear gas into the crowd!) (Run!) (What did he do?) The riot police were not just a bit out of control They were too nervous I felt obligated to remind them I decided to set up a team of social workers that night To serve that purpose at the scene To bring back a sense of justice to our social work (June 12 evening, LegCo announced the cancellation of the meeting) (Chief Executive Carrie Lam called the incident a “riot") (And insisted that the amendment will not be "withdrawn") The original intention of this amendment I still think it's the right decision I don't think it can be withdrawn at this stage At the time I had a very selfish thought This movement will end when someone dies (3 days later) (Leung Ling-kit committed suicide by jumping off a building) (He was the first casualty of the "Anti-Extradition Movement“) (He was wearing a yellow raincoat displaying the words) ("Carrie Lam killed Hong Kong. Cops were cold blooded.“) The Leung Ling-kit incident was The first time blood was shed in a Hong Kong social movement It officially planted the democratic movement in this city The blood of Hong Kong people has been spilled on this land As a result, someone really died But nothing happened The government did nothing I felt that many were in a deep sense of despair That's why I chose to go to the front line The whole month of June in Hong Kong Was wrapped in an unimaginable tendency of self destruction Many young people wanted to die, wanted to jump off buildings That determination and intolerance for injustice Have reached such a point (Miss Wu, 29) (Mr. Mui, 32) (Mr. Kei, 16) It's not just despair There's a strong belief behind it To my understanding They wanted to use their deaths To wake up the Hong Kong people Hongkongers! (Add Oil!) (June 16, 2 million and "one" participated in the rally) (The organizers stated that) (The extra "one person" was the departed Mr. Leung Ling-kit) In my limited knowledge I've never heard of a social movement That can trigger a wave of suicides That kind of despair can only be healed With a "movement" that opens up new possibilities There are 7 million people in Hong Kong two sevenths of our people came out to march That's 2 million people No place in the world has clone anything like this But Hong Kong is such a small place with 7 million people Can accomplish such an incredible feat In this rally, nearly 2 million and "one" participated It shows that our people are very angry The people of Hong Kong will not accept Carrie Lam's response on yesterday's incidents I read a quote on the internet "Young people are chosen by the times“ But I would ask Everyone living in Hong Kong today Why are we the only ones chosen by the times? We were not chosen We chose to come out (July 1, 22nd Anniversary of the Establishment) (Of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) (The flag-raising ceremony was held at the Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai) (For the first time, guests have to move indoors to watch the ceremony) (The government explained that it was because of the weather) The handover, the condition was to have a democratic system Ensuring that a high degree of autonomy can be guaranteed Hong Kong can't be democratized It's impossible to maintain freedom and the rule of law When we marched to Admiralty We were separated in two directions Some students said continue to Central and the rally will end But if you want to support the students You better go to the LegCo Building What's more important? The students or the rally? At first, we anticipated that in the 1997 handover A democratic election system would be fully implemented Then it changed to 10 years after 1997 We accepted 10 years But the CCP officials said "No, not so fast, we will give it to you in 2017!" That's another 10 years later After so many years, we've reached 2019 Forget about it. You can't trust the CCP Let's not just sit here Let's start to organize our defense Let's call people Let's gather supplies It's that simple! (OK!) The first time I picked up the gloves and helmet was July 1 Carrie Lam taught us that peaceful protest was useless We promote civil disobedience that's peaceful and non-violent We don't agree with such behaviors like attacking LegCo Like breaking glass windows We call this type "the Valiant" Not too good Stay calm Don't rush, stay calm LegCo Member - Roy Kwong: Please listen to me Protester: Are you afraid you can't go to work? LegCo Member - Roy Kwong: Can you let me talk? LegCo Member - Roy Kwong: We have agreed No division, no distancing LegCo Member - Kwok Ka-ki: What's the point of charging into LegCo? Protester: We are about to go to work Protester: When you're in a meeting, we'll be working LegCo Member - Kwok Ka-ki: What are you going to do there? LegCo Member - Ted Hui: Calm down first! We're not saying peace is necessarily right And attacking is necessarily wrong But we have to choose the right time Protester: We know we'll get arrested Just let us handle it! If I were there I'd probably stop them from breaking the glass Another motive might be that Some LegCo members were worried That they would get arrested for rioting Please help to pass it over Whether the police were playing “empty fort strategy" or retreating Because they abandoned their post There was a possibility of a surprise strike People go in. Thanks! I wanted to go that night I couldn't help myself Someone stopped me I asked some protesters They said: Actually we were also very scared But they feel that the struggle is the only way to gain freedom (Withdraw) Hong Kong's LegCo has never been occupied by protesters I think that was an historic moment Seeing that image moved me Like there's hope, not for the movement Like a light at the end of darkness The Valiants love Hong Kong more than we do The price they're willing to pay is greater For us, our jail time is 16 months at most For them, it's 10 years! (Withdraw the wicked law) This group of people are very civilized Everyone has a backpack or a bag Why not steal something? We're masked, how'd you know who we are? But Hongkongers won't do that, we always have discipline Some go to kitchens to find food, they'd get scolded Some leave money The destruction of the system, the excess of totalitarianism By comparison, the destruction of properties is not excessive If someone wants to stay till the last minute Go to the podium and discuss it The people who are staying, please gather there There were about 300 people in the chamber After much discussion, many wanted to leave Then Brian Leung took his mask off and came up to speak At this moment, we're not a flash-mob Because occupying LegCo is a once in a lifetime opportunity We can't turn back The more people we have here, the safer we'll be I took off my mask because I want you to know Hongkongers can't lose anymore If we lose again, think about it. It'll be 10 years Our civil society will sink to the ground (We know!) (We're with you!) (Good!) Occupied! (Occupied!) We the occupiers at LegCo now officially announce our "5 Demands“ 1. Full withdrawal of the extradition bill 2. Retract the classification of protesters as "rioters" 3. Amnesty for all arrested protesters from before and the future 4. Thorough investigation into police brutality and abuse of power Organize an independent commission of inquiry And finally, we feel the root of the problem Is that Hong Kong has yet to have universal suffrage For LegCo and the Chief Executive So we demand that the 2020 Legislative Council election Will have universal suffrage We reached a climax at that moment in the chamber There were still dozens of people staying behind But when Brian Leung left Maybe they thought it wasn't worthwhile anymore My friends kept asking me to leave But someone's got to take one more step further Even if the police come in and arrest us That's something too Today we march in here, but yet we just leave How can we sustain the movement tomorrow? LegCo Member - Ted Hui: I'm very calm, I can control myself I'm asking the police to calm down I'm asking the police to calm down (Get out!) Chan Hong Siu: Calm down a bit first LegCo Member - Ted Hui: Restraint! Restraint! Students are leaving Restraint! A girl asked: Can you lend me a megaphone? She didn't even know how to turn on a microphone Or the loudspeaker But she really wanted to tell everyone to stay If everyone left there would be no one to protect the people in the chamber No one wanted to abandon them We just wanted to wait for them and leave together There were rumors that the police would march in there by midnight Everyone was scared The people in the chamber will die (Let's go together!) (Let's go! Take them!) We were saying: What's the matter? Why did so many people come into the chamber? To support us again? For a second there, we were excited Then I found out that they were pulling people out You have to respect our choice We respect your choice to leave You must also respect our choice We decided to stay, the question is why Everyone said: If we leave, we leave together They were pulling them out (Gwyneth Ho: The protester who just came in) (About 100 people) (They went straight to the protesters who refused to leave) (Protesters: Go!) (Be careful!) (Let's go together!) (Go slow!) (Make way! Make way!) Many said, we leave today, we'll come back tomorrow I was very angry at that moment Do you think this is your own backyard? Leave today, come back tomorrow? You can't get in again! I cussed at them repeatedly, fuck them (Gwyneth Ho: A group of protesters just came out from LegCo) (Around 100 of them) (I interviewed one of the protesters) (Why did you guys have this mission?) (Protesters: Because we found out through Telegram) (That 4 justice warriors were staying behind) (So we decided to all come here) (Get them to leave together) (They don't leave, we don't leave) (We make them leave together) (Gwyneth Ho: Now it's very close to the deadline at 12 midnight) (Are you guys afraid you won't be able to leave?) (Protester: We're all very scared) (But we're more afraid of not seeing those 4 people tomorrow) (That's why we're here, to get them to leave with us) (Gwyneth Ho: Did someone from the chamber come out to call on the people) (Or was this a spontaneous action?) (Protester: Someone was holding a megaphone) (They said we have to respect the "Dead Man's" decision) (But we told them to leave together, it's everyone's decision) (Gwyneth Ho: I just used this elevator to leave the LegCo Chamber) We don't have to die, that's great! It was this kind of feeling The next day I watched the Gwyneth Ho's live broadcast There was a change in me I cried when I realized that's how it went down It was just a little girl We're scared But more afraid of not seeing those 4 people tomorrow They really saved us The highest level of "peace and non-violence" Is self-sacrifice When you have proof, seeing what the Valiants are doing And they're on a completely different level Do you have the guts to go in and save them? You don't have the guts I was in prison that night I listened to the whole incident on the radio I cried I was ashamed They're not thugs They're just a group of innocent kids Why did they sacrifice so much for Hong Kong? That kind of shock woke the Hong Kong people up Not because of the destruction, that's just what's on the surface But it's the spirit of their sacrifice behind the destruction That moved Hongkongers Their rescue mission to save us Garnered better public opinion to the protesters' side The effect perhaps may be better than what we did (July 2, 4:00 AM, Carrie Lam said that the violations of Legco) (Will be investigated to the fullest extend) (The government refused to respond to the 5 demands) (The protesters expanded to all districts of Hong Kong) The concrete actions created trust It affected the entire "Anti-Extradition" movement We talked about "brothers keep climbing", "we work our separate ways" "Don't be a snitch" The conflicts between the "peaceful and non-violent" group And "the Valiants" It was completely resolved (HongKongers! Add Oil!) Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times A Valiant protest will get a definite response The other side must respond to us Even if it's just to disperse us That's a response In some ways We all want to force the government to use more force We want them to become "uncivilized“ If we are "civilized", but they're not If the difference is big, then it'll attract more attention Whether we are “be water" or doing hit and runs We (Protesters) don't know which direction to run To define “be water" Is to disperse when our enemy strikes We're setting up roadblocks over there by "Luk Fook Jewellery" Then we'll bolt We'll gather when our enemy is scattered Police are in front of us We would go away and reappear nearby When others close the gate, we flow freely just like water That's “Be Water" I'd take a shield I'd be at the front blocking tear gas I can't say I'm just a "Shield Man" I might be in the back later as a "Smoke Controller" Putting out the smoke and tear gas During "positional warfare“, I'd help to retreat Call out "one, two, one, two" One, two, one, two Look for barriers blocking the road Or to be a sentry wherever they need a look out The riot police got in the car Riot Police in the car on Waterloo Road When I get up to the middle row, I can exchange intel There are 4 or 5 EUs (Assault Vehicles) in the back At the Waterloo Road intersection 30 riot police got out of the car The Elite Team (Special Tactical Squad) is in the back (Push this way?) Just got out of the car (Okay, got it) (I count 4, 5 tear gas bombs) They're firing many tear gas at the Canal Road Flyover It's a Telegram channel There're tens of thousands of subscribers We can figure out when "the Valiants" will take action Then we'd gather everyone there (After they take a picture, they'd send it to me) (Ok, call me if there's a problem, be careful!) (There is a problem) (Because when they disperse after the gathering) (They'd all be in Central) 10, 20 or so friends will help us at the scene as sentries Around 10 people will be at our headquarters We'll divide into two sides One side will do the data entry Immediately measure the situation at the "war zone“ Then decide where our sentries should stand Or if we need to reposition immediately The "Map Team" will send out all the information By instantly uploading info to HK Map app We also have the "Driving Team“ And 2 to 3 "Mic Team" (On-site broadcasters) Some of us were originally "Front Line Protesters" also Like me, I have some connections with the front line Even if I go out to the front, others will have to save me I might as well find another roles that suits me I was just a Hong Kong girl who didn't know how to read Google Maps Then I learned slowly All the administrators on our Telegram channel Were actually strangers, we've never met before We didn't know each other's background Occupation or age But we use Telegram For a common goal We work together from the same generation But we've never met It's like playing online games We can apply that to a protest rally Which explains why there was no "big platform" But we could still accomplish and organize so many things Fuck you I don't have an attitude of playing games But when we're talking about division of labor Class distinction The evolution from "peace and non-violent" to "the Valiant" We continue to go to the "next level" Online games also have many "jobs" and positions If you do Molotovs, water bombs, or paint bombs You'd be called "magician“ We can choose different "jobs" To find something suitable for our own skill set That's why young people Would compare our struggle to online games The mentality of playing games is applied to the real world But to most of the protesters who came out They're all doing it for justice We originally organized a group of drivers Mainly for delivering supplies Simple things We didn't maximize their abilities That's why we opened a Telegram channel Because I was the administrator on the front line My job is to get to the front line And make sure the protesters can go home This is the legendary bullet proof vest So discreet You go this way Ok, I'll be fine Be careful! OK Bye! Here, this tastes good, be careful Thank you! There are too few people today Don't mess with the police They're crazy. Be careful! Thank you! Driver: Police are over there! (Run!) (Don't go solo!) (Run faster!) (Don't go solo!) (Don't go solo!) It's always dangerous I have yet to get arrested I think I've used up all the luck in my entire life Run! There's no one up there! Fuck you! I'm fucking tired! (Drink some water!) You got any? (Get some water, fast!) (Where is it?) (Mom, you go get it!) (It's in the car, just grab a bottle!) (YOU go!) (Thanks for your hard work!) (Be careful, Ok?) I'd go to the front lines every time And also fall to the back as well I'd ask them Brother, do you need a ride? I'd tell them where I'm from They would trust me Then they'd say: so you're “Nobody" He's easy to recognize We're the only channel to go pick up people Everyone knows them At the front line when they hear them ask, "do you need a ride“ They'll know who he is I saw more than 200 of our people who couldn't get home Subways were closed Buses weren't running So I called the station Told them there are 200 mates here Help me get some cars down here Then I saw like 3 rows of private cars coming We called them here They all turned on their emergency lights 3 rows, couldn't even see the end of the line We had a mission, "not one less" We'd call these "parent-cars" I'm insignificant But I'm here to assist you To assist you with certain things Everyone is a nobody They're all contributing in our social movement Because this movement isn't supported by a big platform Everyone is a nobody Nobody is everyone I can't bear how our young people Are being suppressed by the police I'm making a special plea to our young people Please cherish your lives Don't sacrifice yourselves You have to keep on living For the rule of law in Hong Kong Democracy and justice To keep fighting for the long run If you want to arrest me, then do it I have nothing to hide Why won't you let me go to the Government House Why can't the Chief Executive come down here I want to arouse more people Go against this unscrupulous government Five Demands! (Not one less!) (When a new dawn comes, we liberate Hong Kong) The actions of the "peace and non-violent" can inspire people But to be inspiring It must be epic, with many people involved (No Extradition to China) Fight for Freedom! (Stand with Hong Kong!) (We want true universal suffrage) Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times The Lennon Wall was very important I loved the Lennon Wall Through social media like Facebook or Instagram You can receive a lot of messages But it also limits ways for people to receive messages The Lennon Wall can break through this limitation People from different views and backgrounds Can see something through the Lennon Wall For this movement, the Lennon Wall was hit the hardest by the government They hired some middle aged people to destroy the Lennon Walls Fact is, the government is scared Propaganda can let people from another world to learn the truth June 28, G20 Summit Ads were placed in all major newspapers in the world They raised HKD $3 million just 4 or 5 days prior In my experience, that's impossible You can't imagine, they raised HKD $5 million within half a day They did it The ultimate peaceful actions are The "3 strikes" (jobs, stock market, schools) Shut down the society to shake the government But for Hong Kong to have "3 strikes" is not easy If social welfare sector were to go on strike Would that get more people to participate To have more power against employers Against totalitarianism? This is very important You are a fucking Hongkonger It's fucking ridiculous You are ruining Hong Kong I have been here 33 years You are now ruining Hong Kong The economy, the hotels Tourism, the tourism streets, the airlines You are fucking up the real estate market You are ruining Hong Kong But wait for a moment This is the time to question your principles They'd keep saying, "I just want to go to work"? That's such an irresponsible thing to say (If adults would go on strike, kids won't have to fight) We'll continue to get more Hongkongers to join the strike So that the totalitarian government Must face the voice of Hongkongers We went on a hunger strike for more than 10 days Continuing the strike was not the way We had to change So we changed to "Guarding the Children" Mr. Police, I'm Uncle Chan I hope you can follow your conscience To maintain law and order As policemen, you can't treat citizens with brutality Be a conscientious policeman Go back, God is watching you I'm not a well-educated man But I talk to these young kids from the bottom of my heart Don't go too far Alright? It's dangerous! (Got it!) (Stand from a vantage point!) We're not against the police But in these situations The police have to disperse the crowd We would then become useful Let people evacuate in an orderly manner You guys please leave! Police will be here soon! If you don't go, we can't go Uncle Chan, you go first! No way! You guys go first! (Police are coming!) You guys just go! Ok? Let's all go! Quickly! Go faster! Follow! Everyone follow! Follow! Quickly follow! We're surrounded! Let's stand here! Let's stand here and wait! We stand here! The youth are touched by "Guarding the Children" They feel like a group of people are waiting for them They are not alone to face the police Are you alright? There were many people who cared about me Tried to persuade me not to get myself hurt This government isn't worth it I started farming here in the 80s The local agriculture industry has been greatly hurt Because of China Government and property developers Before 2000, I was forced to move out without a reason The oppression never stopped Government and businesses colluding Benefiting the property developers Withdraw the corrupted northeastern plan The land belongs to the people! (The land belongs to the people!) An entire generation has aspirations for our society Filled with hope These young people want to change the world Did the government ever stop and think That this is the group of people they want to stop? (Guarding Hong Kong) ("Guarding the Children") Uncle Chan and I feel the same way About how the young people are suffering now Because back then The youths of the Northeast New Territories helped us They were imprisoned That's why Uncle Chan would do anything for the youth I don't want to see our next generation Destroyed by Carrie Lam July 21 morning I went to report a crime Yuen Long Police colluded with gangsters (Let me make it clear) (Hit any young person wearing black with a face mask!) (Definitely attack!) (If you wear white instead of black, I can let you go) I'm confident in the people of Yuen Long's Six Villages The more protesters come, the more we whack them We'll beat the shit out of them In Yuen Long There were many people wearing white. They were gangsters They came out to beat people up. They crossed the line What's worse is that the police knew all about it They knew what would go down But they did absolutely nothing Because this movement is faceless You'd be forced to pay attention to the reporters Because reporters can't wear masks Gwyneth Ho: Dear viewers from Stand News (This is Yuen Long West Rail Station) (I am inside the paid area of the station) (There are many people in white outside) (With sticks and other weapons) I became famous on July 1 Then I was beaten up on July 21 That created a huge political impact on this incident (Gwyneth Ho: I'm ok) When I stood up I continued to shoot I saw more than 10 guys beating up one person (Stop hitting!) (Don't attack the reporter!) (Stop hitting!) (It hurts!) The man who saved me He needed 7 stitches here You start to realize that this movement has reached a point of no return Can you imagine someone wearing a dress with sequin And sandals with sequin Then you find out she's pregnant She saw someone was getting beat up She decided to go and help that person (Fucking crazy!) I can feel that there is a greater sacrifice coming "The people fear no death, why threaten them with it?" I rushed straight to Yuen Long When I arrived, the assault was over at the subway platform I saw many badly hurt and blood everywhere At that moment, I was angry, really pissed off Not one policeman was there Many citizens called the police But the police cut off the hotline The police had the audacity to conspire with gangsters (Citizen: Why can't I report a crime?) (Why close the gate?) (Reporter: Why did you come so late?) I don't know about being late I got the call and came How long did it take for me to get here I didn't check my watch. I don't know Did you see the chaos? You saw it Then you should know that I can't check my watch On July 21, I saw a group in white holding metal pipes They gathered at the south side But when the police held the press conference They actually said the men in white didn't hold any weapons Wearing white doesn't prove they were part of the fight We can't say You're wearing white so that's probable cause. We're arresting you The criminal investigation team came They didn't see anyone with offensive weapons I want to make this very clear to you When men in white are holding metal pipes And you dare to say you didn't see anyone with weapons This was the reason behind my awakening Last night Did the government, police and gangsters put on a show? When LegCo was occupied by protesters You came out to greet the Hong Kong people at 4:00 AM Last night, where were you the entire time? (One year after the July 21 incident) (Only 8 people in white were prosecuted) (However, 7 people who were attacked were charged with rioting) (Including Legco Member, Lam Cheuk-ting) (Who was helping the victims at the scene) (Reporter: Can you sleep tonight?) (Reporter: Think you'll go to hell?) If the police in a society Become thugs, or oppressors Then the entire social order would be completely reversed What the government wants to do is exactly that Let you people know That when you go against the government And you get beat up, we won't help you That's the message they really want to bring out That's why they brushed you off and didn't arrest you The political power of this incident has a lot of blood on their hands (Gangsters! Gangsters!) The most unjust thing here is the lenience If I get exposed, arrested and imprisoned Because I've broken the law Then I'm willing to take responsibility But this group of police officers And even this group of gangsters Can do just anything without consequences Police: Leave immediately! (Reporter: Are you a protester? Who are you? Get away! Police! (Reporter: But you don't have any IDs) (And you're not wearing a police vest) Police: Police are here! Protester: I know! Don't press anymore, I'm sorry You've already arrested me, I know (Reporter: Did the police beat you up? Protester: My front teeth are gone (Help me!) Hong Kong has reverted back twenty or thirty years Hong Kong was once the safest city, no more We had the most esteemed police force, no more Hong Kong's rule of law is dead Because of the police force's unrestricted power It was the government's intention They deliberately allowed the confrontation Between the police and its people (Citizen: Want to arrest somebody again?) Police: Don't come over here! Police: Are you a lawyer? Citizen: I'm a citizen Police: You are a citizen. Then I don't have to explain to you Go get a lawyer here! Citizen: Give me your badge number I'll get a lawyer to talk to you I asked you nicely Police: I don't want to tell you I don't want to tell you SO what? (Gangsters!) Citizen: I just want a reasonable answer Don't go, I've taken your picture I'm getting a lawyer to talk to you Police: People at East Point Road, stop attacking Or else we will use force, stop charging over here Stop attacking Leave immediately, or else we will use force Hong Kong Police is rubbish! Citizen: You think you're badass? Taxpayers pay you! You're supposed to protect taxpayers! Some people say that the police have lost their conscience I totally agree with that My Chinese name means conscience Don't want to be like those people without their conscience They only do things for money, for power Many joined the police force if they didn't do well in school It's hard to find other jobs that pay as well In fact, I also applied to join the force Ever since I was young, I wanted to be a cop If I did join the force, I think I'd be poisoned by them We hope the police officers on the front line Can tell that the reporters are retreating Reporters are cooperating with the police (Jackie, did they arrest you on charges of illegal assembly?) If the police ever become the government's army There'd be no room for social workers Because it would be pointless There'd be no room to discuss human rights It'd just be a massacre by the military They won't talk about conscience It's all about obeying orders Don't hit people! Don't hit people! Police: We didn't hit anyone! You can't use brutality on our citizens! Did you hear me! Officers of the law cannot hit people! We are all Hongkongers You have to abide by police rules Mr. Policeman, you are here to enforce the law Now, Uncle Chan is asking you to give me The name of the person you arrested Tell me, can you do that? I have the right to monitor the police Let's go away, let reporters have this spot OK I hope you... Police: Get back We're falling! We're falling! Stampede! Stampede! Police: Reporters please stay back Police: Don't move (Citizens: Don't hit an old man) You're hitting me? You're hitting me? (We are wearing the yellow vest) (Why is the police doing this?) (He's a 70 year old man) I can't protect the children anymore! I'm so heartbroken (You tried your best) (Don't get riled up) I'm useless, I can't save the children (Get some rest) Gangsters! Gangsters! Why do I want to be a paramedic? Because I was born in an ambulance My parents only called the ambulance minutes before I was born Couldn't make it to the hospital The ambulance just parked by the road I was born in the car Mask on! On June 12, I didn't want to go to the front line People at the front line didn't know much about paramedic work Then I just got further and further up the front Even today, I'm working at the front line (Press here) (Yes, do the bandage first) Be careful! I've always had airway allergies If I smell second hand smoke, I would cough out a lung Feeling better? Escort! Wear a mask! Go up to the patient (Protesters: 1, 2, 1, 2) There is smoke over there. Escort him over there There is still smoke, you should retreat further Let's step back Get your stuff, I'm taking you to a place further back They're getting ready to fire again They've raised the orange flag (Hurry and put on the mask) (There is a lot of heavy smoke in the back) (There is a lot of heavy smoke) Uncle, wear it! Let's move further down That was the time I inhaled the most tear gas (They have to rinse the eyes again, we just rinsed it with water just now) (Water is useless) It's safe here (Want some water?) (August 31) (Dissidents clashed in the MTR trains) (After the confrontation, the police entered Prince Edward Station) (On the grounds of handling the situation) (Due to a serious incident, this station will now be closed) On August 31, I got a text on my phone On the train at Yau Ma Tei Station 4 people were wounded and bleeding Police: Come out! Police: Come on! Come on! (Emergency broadcast) (Due to a serious incident, this station will now be closed) (Passengers must leave immediately) (All gates are now open) Reporter: What are you doing? Police: It's dangerous! I didn't think twice and ran to Yau Ma Tei Station I'm a paramedic, I am holding a flag Obstructing a rescue is against the law I was hoping the police wouldn't do that On behalf of all the wounded below, I am calling for help Sir, I beg you! I beg you! Where is your sympathy? We are only here to rescue people! Police: You're not needed here. You're just talkin'' to yourself I'm very disappointed in you, sir! (The police are shit!) I just want to save people (Piece of shit!) I'm begging you I can give you all my equipment Sir, let me come in and save some people Afterwards, you can hit me, shoot me, whatever you want You can even arrest me I beg you to let me save them! (Open the gate you asshole corrupt cops!) (You murderer, fuck you!) Fuck you! I just want to save people (Fuck you all, you fucks are not even human!) (Fuck you!) (Calm down) (How can you call yourselves cops? Fuck you!) I just wanted to save people We won't attack the police We don't attack people I was depressed for 2 to 3 months My emotions exploded at that moment The police repeatedly said that nobody was wounded in the station Who would believe them? We all saw the live broadcast August 31 was a big turning point Before August 31, I was full of love and compassion Don't let anger consume you Some things are just morally wrong Just now, he was talking about murder I totally oppose to that Then how are you different from the cops? We have to first figure out what is the cause And what is the effect How the police selectively enforce the law is the cause How we deal with that on our own is the effect Don't let him escape! The dogs (police) are here! Police: Calm down. Put it down When someone gets killed That person is dead Using a defibrillator or CPR is useless If you kill someone and you just say that you regret it Those are just words It's no use. That person won't come back to life Taking a life for a life taken, that's the logical thing to do To solve the problem You were saying that violence can't solve problems But violence can stop people with problems I think there are too many people with problems You can't get rid of them completely Even if you kill Carrie Lam Another Carrie Lam will come along That's why we have to fight for dual universal suffrage Use the system to solve existing problems You heard him say 'taking a life for a life taken' just now But you can see that he's a very kind person He runs out to help people, rescuing them (October 1, on the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China) (President Xi Jinping presided over a military parade in Beijing) (The same day) (Hong Kong's Civil Human Rights Front launched a demonstration) (Opposed by the police) (Many initiated their own rallies in different various districts) My father was born in the Mainland during the Civil War He knows very well that the Communist Party is terrifying So he told me not to participate in the demonstrations Xi Jinping has the same mindset as other emperors You'd find that he doesn't care about the Hong Kong economy He is pursuing a greater task of unification First take back Hong Kong Then Taiwan If he can accomplish these missions Then he would become the greatest man in modern Chinese history An emperor A man in power Will not share his power with you And give you political rights He won't In pursuing his dreams, Hong Kong is not important China! (Long Live!) (October 1, fuck your celebration) Such small power Can resist such oppression I'll be home for dinner I'll be back It doesn't matter, whatever I gotta go, I'm busy I gotta go, I'm busy Fine! Fine! My clad often asked me if I go to participate in the demonstrations I'd answer no Every time I go, I'd lie to my parents Telling them that I was playing basketball They never thought I would go to the demonstrations My clad said to me: "Do you think CCP would let you get away with a revolution And the independence of Hong Kong?" He told me there was no hope Stop thinking about it I replied, "How can there be hope if we don't try?" Even if it's just a little bit A single spark can start a prairie fire (An 18 year-old protester was shot in the lung) (With a live round by the police) (He was later charged with rioting and assaulting the police) My chest hurts! I can't breathe In such a civilized place How can such a barbaric governance be happening? This type of governance is almost like they're raping us They don't care about your feelings In the end, they'll do whatever they want To survive under this type of governance, this social atmosphere And the political environment It's difficult to protest in a gentle and peaceful way Just pull the door We need a look-out over there Do we have any sentries over there? Look over there! Watch your head! (Got a hammer?) (Watch your head!) Close the door! Fuck you! (Anti-Communist) "To decorate“ is to destroy "Red capital“ are shops with Mainland capital And "Blue Ribbon“ shops Which are the ones with a political stand supporting the government These shops are part of the reason for Hong Kong's downfall When the society turned authoritarian When the police began to act uncivilized And you still use civil disobedience, then it won't work That's why "uncivil disobedience" is reasonable (Communist Railway) (Protester: Don't do that!) (They think we did this) (We don't steal things) Freedom is always more important than money Money can be earned back I'd rather fight for a higher cause A society with equality I hope to be a lawyer in the future Where'd you find this? I made it! It cost me HKD $50! It's already evaporating! Where'd you buy this? Gasoline, HKD $25 a bottle That's fuckin'' expensive Yeah! There's only a little bit left It's evaporating I spilled it on my clothes! Fuckin'' hell Fuck! Now what? Can we still use it? Fuck! Why don't we go and burn the Bank of China Fuck you! It's all gone! All gone! Fuck! Evaporated! Evaporated? I told you to use it right away Now we can't use it, fuck you! We light this, we're all dead If I were the police I wouldn't be scared of the Molotov cocktail Because I have the gear Fireproof, protective gear Then why did we still throw the Molotovs? Because we want to tell the government that If you refuse to listen to the Hong Kong people Then we just have to escalate our actions I'd rather sacrifice my future I'd rather burn with the whole Hong Kong economy I'd rather paralyze Hong Kong You have to get the global community to take action Free Hong Kong, pass the Act Today, more than 1500 Hongkongers The youngest at the age of 12 Have been unreasonably arrested Their pain is my pain We belong to the same community Struggling for our right of self-determination So we can build one brighter and common future Economic sanctions, political sanctions Then we have the chance to burn CCP If we are going to burn in Hong Kong Then CCP will burn with us One of the guys made a lasting impression on me He came over to help me with my helmet It was too loose, I didn't know how to adjust it He carefully helped me fix it He told me to be careful, you're too young, don't go to the front lines He said his life is worthless, so he can take it Then he tapped his helmet twice and left Nobody's life is worthless Everyone is useful in some ways We know we're all brothers and sisters in arms So we trust each other It's a mutual trust at critical moments Where does this trust come from? I think it's from a collective scar that all of us have When we were attacked by tear gas We've suffered some latent diseases I knew our bodies couldn't handle it And women had a very serious problem Their menstrual cycles were all messed up Our period was dark brown or black My relationship with my father was really bad We haven't talked for a long time We've bumped into each other on the street once It was like we were strangers We didn't even look at each other, and just went separate ways I've inhaled a lot of tear gas I was coughing really badly, and got bronchitis Someone said, "Your son is coughing real bad“ The other said, "He asked for it. Who told him to go?" "Don't expect me to take care of him" These are my parents We used to live happily at home Enjoyed home-cooked meals But I haven't been home for 6 months Haven't slept in my own bed How do you open this? Are you mentally challenged? I've never opened one at home What? Can't open it What are you doing? I want to open the windows Leaves are blowing in You guys have to open some windows OK! Chicken wings, Guy Lok, are you ready for seconds? (News: Protesters are gathered at Prince Edward Road West) Why did he go to bed so early? He's sleepy, he always goes to bed early He usually sleeps by midnight Teammates don't know my name They just call me "Mom“ They call us “Dad" and "Mom“ Because we've gathered many "lone rangers" at the front line We took care of their safety There were people younger than me Protecting me at the front line At their age, we should be protecting them Instead of them protecting us Where is Snake? Is he on the way? Snake is at the front line in Tsim Sha Tsui, retreating What's "Mom's“ position? We gradually became a family We developed an intimate and emotional bond That kind of bond comes from going through hell together Everyone deeply cares for each other We can retreat from there and go that way Be careful, stay on one side Just now, who was truly relaxed If you joined this movement because of empathy Or because of anger You won't last too long When the movement becomes stagnant You'll feel lost and powerless At that point, you'd have to ask yourselves Why did you come out to participate? Then an 18-year old kid quickly stood up He told me he had something to say, so I said go ahead Sometimes it's not about what you want or don't want to do It's about your ability and responsibility Every time when the riot police Were hunting people down, it was very dangerous That one time, I happened to catch my girlfriend's hand Took her hand and ran The moment I touched her hand, I knew I liked her Young love Like those romantic TV dramas I thought we should take a picture for birthday Then "Mom" stopped me Other kids also commented They were afraid something may happen And everyone will get in trouble with the photo I wasn't opposed to shooting the photo I wanted to, but I couldn't When we put on our gear, we could recognize everyone But when we take off our gear, we might not be able to This kind of relationship is created by this movement I'm afraid after this movement I will have nothing to do with these people I'm watching our back (We support the police... Shooting themselves in the head!) Sis! "Dad“ is old, don't walk too fast! Can't hold on This picture, maybe a few years later Or some time later I'll look at it again And reminisce that I once Had a group of brothers and sisters in arms I felt true love in them We were not blood related, but we were like a family We have different family names But we're bound together in our hearts (Happy birthday to brothers!) (Happy birthday to you!) My birthday wish is Liberate Hong Kong! The revolution of our times! Mid-Autumn festival is a day for reunions I want to take a picture Should we get someone to shoot for us? Western doll is in the middle For everyone's safety If something happens to the both of us You'll have to pretend we've never met We're not your "Mom“ and "Dad" (Since the movement started) (Many floating bodies and cases of suicide) (From jumping off buildings were found) (Police classified them as “no suspicion") When everyday becomes so absurd We begin to lose our humanity Hong Kong shouldn't be this way (Outside Yau Tong Disciplined Services Quarters) (It was suspected that a corpse was pushed off the building) (Through a transom window) The deceased are suspected to be victims of staged suicides They go missing or they get thrown off buildings The victim's families Is it possible they've been warned by China? You expose us, then your other child will be in danger (September 22) (The naked corpse of 15-year-old protester Chan Yin-I am) (Was found at sea) (Police said there was no foul play and quickly cremated the body) If people don't believe it, you'll have to explain Why would an excellent swimmer take off her clothes To kill herself at sea You don't give any evidence Saying that there's no suspicion, will only raise more suspicion I've often dreamt of being hunted or killed My mood has never been too good I don't want to believe that sexual assault and violence occurred But I think it did happen (October 22, an 18-year-old girl reported a crime) (Accusing policemen gang raped her in a police station) (She also got pregnant and had an abortion) A woman has made these accusations Investigators are following the direction of "misleading the police" Or "giving false evidence" We want real justice No Sexual Violence Illegal naked searches violate human rights (November 4) (22-year-old college student Alex Chow fell to his death) (From a height at a rally) (Police claimed that they did not enter the scene of the incident) (Later found out they lied) It's a place where people are forced to sacrifice their lives to be heard But you know the government wouldn't do anything Then you become very angry (November 11) (Protesters are outraged by the death of Alex Chow) (They initiated a traffic blockage in Hong Kong forcing people to) (Go on strike for work, school and the financial market) Liberate Hong Kong! The revolution of our times! We have to go home! Hongkongers! Revenge! Forcing people to join the 3 strikes by closing the roads Will not be effective People must do it voluntarily to make it work You can't force people to go on the 3 strikes Is there no train? You have to wait now, there's an incident over there How long is the wait? Don't know, we have to take care of it first So annoying You think I don't gotta work? I wanna go to work The first time I went out was "Operation Dawn" I went out alone I had to get to school before 8 am I didn't want to be late If I was late, then my school would've called my mom I was very scared when the riot police got off the car My legs were shaking I was carrying my schoolbag, it was very heavy There were many other Form 4 and 5 students They ran fast I was carrying a heavy bag filled with books There was a riot police who was running exceptionally fast I was running in the last batch I ran as fast as I could I was really afraid of getting arrested on my first time out (Reporter: There are police officers here) (That's a traffic policeman) (He drew a gun, he drew a gun) (He just opened fire!) Our plan was just blocking the road They'd shoot at armed robbers only at the legs But this time, they shot an unarmed Masked youngster in the heart The shooting of a man in the street And then the motorcycle incident Amnesty has gone on to say that "These are not policing measures" "These are officers out of control" "With a mindset of retaliation" How concerned are you that after more than Five months of this crisis your police force is Starting to look out of control? If you want to paralyze traffic in Hong Kong at CUHK There are 3 ways One is the railway Second is the Tolo Highway Third is Tai Po Road If we can block these three roads From New Territories to Kowloon Or from Kowloon going into New Territories There's no way through My team has many people from CUHK I consider the Chinese University as my home After traffic jams were everywhere We knew something happened at CUHK So we went there immediately This is the campus life, you hear me? When we retreated back, we all panicked for a while Because everyone saw it at the same time Someone was thrown down by the police and got arrested Protester: Run! Tear gas canisters exploded at our feet Then tear gas got into our pants through the crotch area It got into our sex organs It's the most painful experience for men What gets me mad is seeing the police break into our prestigious school The anger of seeing our civilized society destroyed We're from that school, naturally we have a sense of belonging When we were guarding that university It symbolized us protecting Hong Kong Many Hongkongers came to CUHK to help University staff: Our principal wants to solve this problem now Protester: Are gatherings illegal within the campus? Not really, let's clarify this matter What about the arrested and the injured? I've arranged a lawyer to help these students In fact, the students are being treated unjustly (Release them!) Their arrest is already unjust in itself Even if you get lawyers to help them in this case They would be helping them under injustice The students only want justice I want to ask As a principal of a university, you're an influential person in society Your status is so unique Then why is a 22-year-old student wearing a bulletproof vest Standing here in front of you, inside the campus talking to you Why didn't you come yesterday morning or this morning Every time after something happened You'd only appear within the school campus Why? From June until now What kind of protection is this? (You can't even protect us) Reporters and spectators, please leave immediately All the people behind you are armed Principal, please leave now! Principal Tuan, please leave immediately This is not the time for negotiation This is not the time for negotiation and talking Please leave immediately At first, there was a "ceasefire agreement" But when Principal Tuan was close to the police line, then suddenly Orange flag! Principal, orange flag! We were on the No.2 Bridge guarding and throwing Molotovs The purpose was to stall for time And prevent the police from coming in (Make way, make way!) Are there anymore Molotovs? One of our teammates brought a flare gun We needed a location that's safe with a clear view To fire at the police We decided to walk up the hillside above the No.2 Bridge We waited for the chance to let the police walk into our range Wow, fuck! No, no! Missed the target! Our brothers are running down there now (He's on our side, he's a brother) Be careful, don't get hit in the head! Don't throw them now! There are teammates below Brothers, listen to me, be careful when throwing the Molotovs There are many reporters down there Only throw the Molotovs when the police arrive (We got some of our people down there) (Our people, be careful!) (Those are our people down there!) The police won't dare to come in now Give them some time Retreating, retreating! The police are coming! They're coming! The police are not close enough yet! Fire! Fire! Mother fucker! After the police saw that we got the flare gun The next 5 minutes they became less aggressive They were all college and high school students inside CUHK If you were there, you'd keep hearing people yelling It hurts; it's hot in here; it's stuffy here; I can't breathe The amount of tear gas has reached a level That even if you wear a gas mask You'd still feel it and have difficulty breathing But no one backed out Everyone kept on guarding the No. 2 Bridge We have never successfully stayed all night We've never even guarded pass dawn without getting kicked out That moment was very encouraging for us (I beg you all to go on strike tomorrow) (We can't wait any longer, we don't know if there'll be a tomorrow) (Do you understand us?) (Don't tell us to evacuate) (We have to go and protect this place) (We don't want to sacrifice ourselves) (But we have to hold off the police) (In order to stop them from attacking) (We also want peace) (The only thing you can do is go on strike) (If you don't want us to die, then you have to go on strike) That night I slept at CUHK I looked at the sky and felt something real But at the same time, it felt very surreal Inside a university in Hong Kong Throwing Molotovs to protect our people We could die The truth is, we were very scared A few thousand tear gas canisters were fired at us We even heard that bombs were hidden near the No. 2 Bridge Wow, isn't that ridiculous? The people guarding the No. 2 Bridge were crazy to call the police Called them to come to CUHK to beat them up They're out of their fucking minds They don't think for minute why we were guarding that bridge They really thought they were fucking cool, winning the battle But I want to say that If they really wanted to storm in, it would be easy They have a lot of weapons, like water cannons, real guns, etc They retreated Because Principal Tuan negotiated with them, then they left You think they were really scared of our measly Molotov cocktails? Everyone fought hard to win a good battle the other clay But don't dwell in the feeling of winning, it can cloud our minds (Why were there bombs?) Yesterday, they thought the police were coming into CUHK So they wanted to set bombs to blow them up (Fucking crazy!) Our CUHK students persuaded most people to leave Let our CUHK people continue to guard the school Finally, they dismantled the bombs before they left The whole thing was resolved The brothers who stayed on the bridge all night We will continue to have people coming over to CUHK Baptist U, City U and Poly U Their siege is getting even worse now I hope everyone sends out messages To help these universities with reinforcements (November 17) (Protesters moved to occupy Polytechnic University) (Blocking the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, a main transportation hub) The Police also targeted the Cross-Harbour Tunnel Poly U is next to the tunnel We finally chose Poly U That night, as soon as I arrived, I went to Zone Z I was responsible for “Customs" I had to question newcomers and ask them where they were from Checked their bags, body searched them There were already many people when I arrived After experiencing the battle at CUHK We got better at doing things, more professional Take this out Give it to someone else This was a great deal HKD $15? That is a deal, so cool Got it on Toy Street in Sham Shui Po Just pull back the rubber band and release Some people were calm and collected, working on propaganda Some were making Molotovs by the swimming pool Some went to search for raw materials at the labs It was like a small community Everyone did different things Having just finished the CUHK battle It felt like Hongkongers just got a shot of confidence We felt like we finally beat the police Could we do it again? Everyone is confident Next, we'll go to the East TST Bridge And see if we can hold our guard We'll try, if we can't hold it, we'll have to retreat We'll be forced to stand and fight! If the police attack from the East TST Bridge The entire Poly U will fall Poly U will be finished Be careful It's been a long time since we had a headquarter of sorts We had resources and a lot of manpower We can take different shifts We were able to change our clothes to go to the front lines It gave me a feeling that everyone was together again One team, at the same place We were together on the front lines. Doing things together The next morning there was news that The police wanted to storm in This is a police warning You are participating in an illegal assembly Leave immediately Or else the police will use tear gas infused blue liquid to disperse And then we will arrest you This is a warning from the police There were more young protesters at Poly U Many young people were holding Molotovs I didn't know if they've ever thrown one Or even know how to You'd get a bit lost at that moment Everyone was holding a Molotov Like a real war Brothers and sisters, please come into Poly U Liberate Hong Kong! The revolution of our times! When I arrived at Poly U, I ran to the front I was a bit scared Don't waste the Molotovs Because we were short on Molotovs We had to pick them back up We can't afford to lose this valuable resource There are more than a dozen bottles of Molotovs here (Bring them to me, ok?) (Liberate Hong Kong! The revolution of our times!) (Hongkongers! Revenge!) You have to support the bottom Support the bottom So many bottles (Brothers and sisters! Everyone pay attention!) (The firewall in Zone Y has successfully blocked the police) (And our reinforcements have reached Gascoigne Road) Fuck you! Why are you so stubborn? Stand with Hong Kong It's ok, it's nothing! Head down! Spit it out! Got towels? On the side, water hose Take it off! Take it all off! Help me take it away! Rinse the face first Ok, I got you Unload the gear Rinse the face When I got to PolyU, most of the entrances were closed I got in through a small path I had no idea how dangerous it was when I got in I was just trying to help out any way I can Everyone thought this would be like CUHK The police would eventually leave After a while, we had an idea of what's going on Then we were scared We heard news that the police were coming We also heard non-stop gun fire and people screaming Retreat after you throw it After burning the armored car, I knew something was wrong By that time most of the exits were closed Including all small paths I just want to take these ordinary citizens away But we don't have a safe exit It's a dead end over there (Police: You stay in the university, just go back!) You want us to stay in the university? (Police: Just go back!) You want us to stay in the university? (Police: Just go back!) I want to see your commanding officer They fucking surrounded us In normal life, dating crises are just the daily quarrels But the crisis now is We can all get arrested here at Poly U I can do it myself Can you bring me a mask filter Sisi's filter needs to be replaced (Intercom: OK!) At night, I'd be at the front line as a "shield" Standing there blocking the water cannon And cover people throwing Molotovs (Reporter: Is it still burning?) It fucking hurts, man! (Reporter: You just got hit by a tear gas infused blue liquid) The sting has stopped. I feel better now! Are you good"? I want to go fight The water cannon is about 100 meters away They're only firing at the side. Watch out! (Don't get shot!) Ok? (Reporter: I'm Ok) It's nothing That's the spirit (Reporter: My helmet blocked it) Let someone else throw it first, then we'll throw it Can you pass me a Molotov? You can throw it Quick, break! Fuck you! Molotov cocktail! I want a gas mask and goggles. Thanks I can't stand it. Fuck! You'd see armored and water cannon vehicles Continuously firing Firing tear gas and rubber bullets every five minutes All the Poly U students at Zone A They never retreated Non-stop tear gas, and water cannons with tear gas infused liquid Never stepped back They just raised their umbrellas together every time Everyone would yell “Hold it", for a few minutes Then they put their umbrellas down Then the front line people would be replaced By a new group who can take it Seeing this image, this group of people are magnificent And very tough Because this was not our usual rally With only a handful of tear gas canisters, this was non-stop Actually, the police were trying to deplete our energy They kept on attacking from the outside And we kept on going out there to defend I once thought What would happen if they came in here and killed us all? At 4 or 5 in the morning, the police charged in I never thought I would get shot I got shot above my eye the first time I was lucky I was most scared of not being able to walk out of there Can't go back to the front line Actually, I did these things Because I wanted to tell the government Hongkongers will not be silenced because of money or oppression I will not let anyone to rob my freedom I will not let anyone take away my freedom of thinking I will not let anyone take away my free will Hong Kong needs to prove to them That even eggs can knock down walls They can go over high walls and be thrown across I was the administrator of the"parent-cars“ I would go to Poly U to pick people up and leave Arrange nearby places for people to be picked up by "parents" When we were under siege, I never thought I couldn't escape According to international practice In any protest, there must be a way for people to leave But the police didn't do that If the police wanted to arrest us They could just pit us against a corner We were their targets They could've easily smashed us to bits Can't go that way, idiot Police: Anyone entering or staying within the PolyU campus And assisting the rioters May be considered a complicit in rioting The first time we tried to break out, we were unsuccessful Couldn't hold it. They fired tear gas from 3 sides They kept on firing and many were arrested The police had mapped out a plan to capture us They won't let us leave. They'd arrest us as we come out Kneel down! Get away! Stop shooting! What's your name? Stop shooting! What is your name? Police: Stand back, stop obstructing police business I'm asking you, why did you shoot after he surrendered? Police: You can ask our Public Relations Department, ok? Why did you shoot after he surrendered? You guys said you had rules to follow! Don't shoot! They are human beings! My name is Lam Chun Liberate Hong Kong! The revolution of our times! There was a 2nd plan People outside would come and save us We had high hopes Many people were still inside Poly U A few hundred just at the front line So some people were coming to Poly U Using different ways to come in Many citizens were just in their casual clothes Without any gear Arrived at Salisbury Road Go to Poly U! Save the students! Brothers kept on calling out Come out! Come out! If you don't come out The brothers and sisters at Poly U will be doomed A group of rioters have gathered at Poly U For more than one week Everyone staying at Poly U Must be arrested immediately Police are involved in a tense standoff with protesters Who barricaded themselves inside a university in Hong Kong (The protesters who've stayed, many inside, have no way out) I am here to appeal to all members of our society Please save Poly U There are many students trapped Inside our campus right now Please come out and help our school! Save Poly U I beg you ! Don't! Police: I beg you not to beg me! My clad called me He was at the rally in Hung Hom With other families petitioning Be a humanitarian and let their children go You can even bring their parents into Poly U So they can peacefully bring their children out You can arrest them Try them in the court of law But you can't use violence, or lynching If I can't get my daughter out I will jump off a building! The government must give me back my daughter! I was very worried After all, it was quite dangerous outside My clad told me I had to man up This was no time to be afraid At that moment, I couldn't control my emotions I cried non-stop I don't want my family to be in danger But my family chose to come out for me I'm sorry I've let them down On the morning of the 18th We started to look at the floor plan of Poly U Later, someone delved into the water sewer to escape Some escaped through the train tracks The sense of morality was very strong that day You'd see people wearing suits Digging bricks on the side of the road The scene was insane The Poly U incident Really brought Hongkongers to the street to fight 24-hour non-stop Dozens of cars were waiting By the exits at Poly U where our brothers and sisters may come out The whole city came out to save Poly U, from all directions Zone A had 2 teams coming in One from Tsim Sha Tsui The other from Hung Hom Zone Z had a team coming from Mong Kok Save Poly U! Save Poly U! Save Poly U! There were mainly 2 groups of protesters at Poly U One group wanted to leave, find a way to escape The other chose to wait for rescue to come Then dash out to join them When I got to the bridge People were climbing down with ropes They had just started using the ropes Just go for it, take a gamble It was the last chance If you couldn't make it, then you weren't leaving You couldn't leave safely So I called Snake Told them to come to Zone Y Don't worry about it, the bridge But they didn't reply me They didn't reply me At that moment, I didn't want to go to the bridge I wanted to dash out Because... You could feel that it was a historical moment That was the next turning point of the last six months You could feel it Everyone risked their lives To dash out there To meet up with them Even if people had to step over my dead body Someone will make it That's the scene That scene will make history When I decided to dash out I had to strip away my identity As a student As the son of my parents As a future social worker I had gotten rid of all my identities At that moment, I had only one identity Even if I had to sacrifice my life, I dashed out As a Protester Get away! Let him go! The police had real guns, rubber bullets Water cannons, armored vehicles We were using our head count, And our bodies as a wager Hoping the sheer number of us could dash in The van wants to charge over there, doesn't it? Wow! Fuck! In the end, we came up half a block short of getting in It was tough But we just couldn't do it We almost turned a page in history We were so close We were halfway That clay, "the peaceful and non-violent" and "the Valiant" were one That clay, the people on the street had only one goal It was to rescue the people from Poly U If we were water Then Poly U was the sponge We were all in there and couldn't come out The sponge was squeezed by the police, With a great amount of force We were cut off from the outside We could only communicate by phone Either we wait for our deaths, get 10 years jail time Or we find a way to escape But we could die while trying How would you choose? Many people at Poly U Were faced with the most important question of their lives (November 19, Before Dawn) (Approved by the police) (Many high school principals entered PolyU) (To persuade students under 18 to leave) (After registering their names) There are still people inside I'm not going, let me think about it Give me time to think about it, don't bother me! You're 15, right? I'll lead you out I can Let me make it clear to you Hold on a bit longer Backup has already broken through the walls (We really want to see you back at school) When we were at the brink of an emotional breakdown We tried to go down the sewer I looked into it and couldn't see anything It was too dark down there We lost our sense of direction I was looking at the map and couldn't understand it There were cockroaches Many cockroaches were coming at me on both sides The sewage water was up to my neck It was very cold The further I got into the sewer, the narrower it got Oxygen levels were dropping Breathing was becoming difficult Crawling like that, you'd consume a lot of energy I couldn't take it anymore The entire rescue team consisted of several units We saved about 400 people During the rescue, the heartbreaking thing was We had given the protesters a route to escape But there was no guarantee that they would come out safely Some people lost contact When they didn't report back after 2 hours We'd see their GPS locations And discover that they were still in the sewer I was crying my eyes out No one would know if you died in the sewer No one could find you No one would know what you experienced Your existence can suddenly Be washed away by the sewage water Who wanted our young kids to Go through this kind of suffering? My mom called and asked if I was at Poly U She told me not to worry There must be a way to escape I broke down at the moment I don't know what can be done We were hiding in one of the rooms with the door locked I didn't know whom the room belonged to Whose table was that I wrote a note to the owner of the table I wrote that we were trying to escape Don't know what would happen Sorry for messing up your table It was nice to have known you I really didn't know what to write We were desperate That we wrote to this stranger My first time dashing out I was afraid of getting arrested, there was a big chance So I recorded a will If something happens to me, or if I get arrested Please help me take care of my family I don't know what will happen If I really have to go to prison for 10 years I hope you will help me fight and liberate Hong Kong My school team has to get into the elite finals If not, I'll surely come back for you Fuck you! You guys have to keep pushing on At the time of hopelessness inside Poly U I recorded a message (We've tried crawling through the sewers) (We've tried dashing out) (We've tried to find ways to escape) (But it's a dead end) (We don't want to give up) (But we can't hold on any longer) That's it (November 29) (The siege lasted for 16 days, the police finally unblocked PolyU) (1,377 people were arrested) (And 318 underage students were registered) (The protest movement suffered a great defeat) (Taiwan) "Be water" is to be Able to change strategy when needed When we faced difficulties And if something didn't work We must think in a different way Some of my “kids“ were registered when they left Poly U There's a record for the government to track down Some of our pictures were taken at the bridge We could be recognized "Dad“ planned to leave Hong Kong We came to Taiwan first, Snake was the last one to come Coming to Taiwan doesn't mean that we've forsaken Hong Kong Doesn't mean our movement is over We have to think out of the box How we can regroup and prepare ourselves I'm a little bit broken down Because you'd never think that after your name was registered You'd be arrested if you tried to leave Hong Kong Within 48 hours I was thinking, would I be able to leave? Just come and arrest me at the airport If I knew I was going to be arrested I might've been more at ease Writing a letter to my girlfriend I'm a caring boyfriend The time spent while we're separated We've been worried about each other After leaving the airport, I took a bus to Taipei Station Then I saw her It was an amazing moment It's difficult to want to see someone I looked at my lost brothers and sisters I couldn't see them after they got arrested I couldn't hold back Because what's left of me Were the people sitting in front of me They are real, right here beside me "Dad“ Snake Together as a family It's also the trust they always have in me Gives me the courage to continue to be "Mom“ When Snake arrived in Taiwan He couldn't sleep until dawn No more exercising No more sports, no more jogging It's ironic, Snake was a social worker Sometimes, he'd know that I'm under a lot of pressure He'd come over and talk to me I knew he wanted to comfort me If Hong Kong were a person And Poly U was their emotional illness I wouldn't know how to comfort them When you see so many people Still willing to fight for Hong Kong But I chose to leave I feel I've let them down Tear gas, watch out. Better not cry Chris Tang (Commissioner of Police) is coming to town Taiwan Freedom! Every vote counts! Taiwan Freedom! I thank everyone for standing up Let's create a more magnificent Taiwan together In Taiwan Every citizen can vote to elect their president Hong Kong doesn't have that A man in his 40s came up to me and said Your situation in Hong Kong He experienced it in Taiwan when he was young They spent 40 years To establish the current political system So the road is very long You guys have to be careful, "add oil' We are guarding the beacon of Chinese democracy To give Hong Kong hope Tsai Ing-wen won because Everyone in Taiwan Wants to tell the government of Taiwan and China That they don't need, don't want To be a part of China I feel very emotional, very happy Taiwan can hold the last line of defense Taiwan has succeeded with their votes Tsai Ing-wen has won the election Hong Kong and Taiwan will influence each other We won't let CCP succeed anywhere We will do whatever it takes To protect our freedom and democracy Tsai Ing-wen! (Elected!) 12,11 10, 9 Liberate Hong Kong The revolution Of our times Happy New Year! The revolution of our times The revolution of our times is not only for Hong Kong We are the front line against the Chinazi The front line of the world The CCP has committed crimes against humanity Everything they've done has damaged the social system Hong Kong should be regarded as the Hong Kong of the world International Hong Kong Frontier of the free world, fighting against totalitarianism The bill is passed and without objection The motion to reconsider is laid on the table The United States stands in solidarity With freedom-loving of Hong Kong And we fully support their fight for freedom Globalization gave rise to China China's economic growth Many for their self interest Including many western countries Turned a blind eye to the rise of China's power This would threaten the freedom and democracy of the world Hong Kong has let the West and the world know To look back in history Every totalitarian state Will topple one day I truly believe That clay will come for the CCP Hong Kong's chances of becoming independent Are higher than before Especially after this movement You can see the focus from the West about Hong Kong Is the fact that CCP has not fulfilled the Sino-British Joint Declaration If the CCP failed to fulfill its promises in the declaration Can the CCP exercise its sovereignty over Hong Kong again? Of course I'm only analyzing it objectively I'm putting on a helmet, I'm not supporting Hong Kong independence Fact is, I am only fighting for one thing That is freedom It means that people should be in control of their own destiny Then that would be freedom For a place too I've grown a lot this past year I clearly know my own identity I've become a true Hongkonger One English word The word "Hongkonger" is in the dictionary Hong Kong people's identity is established There is no turning back CCP will not let Hong Kong go It will not allow for independence But this past year We've made a lot of impossibilities Into possibilities I really don't know what the future holds It's best to let Hongkongers decide for themselves Instead of someone else deciding for them (June 30, 2020) (The National People's Congress passed) (The "National Security Law" in Hong Kong to punish crimes) (Such as secession and endangering the country) (Hongkongers can be sent to China for trial) (And the maximum sentence is life imprisonment) "National Security Law" completely by-passes the Basic Law It gives absolute power to the chief executive And national security officials to work in Hong Kong To achieve comprehensive control and monitoring (July 1, 2020) (On the 23rd Anniversary of the Establishment of Hong Kong SAR) (The "National Security Law" of Hong Kong was implemented) Hong Kong Independence! The only way out! (Snake and his girlfriend returned to Hong Kong from Taiwan) (Again taking the streets to protest) ("Mom and Dad" are still in Taiwan) As long as there are Hongkongers in this place Hong Kong will not be hopeless Why are they so courageous? I'm not sure I really don't know why they are so courageous Maybe in a time of despair It's the last struggle (By the end of 2020) (The police arrested 10,144 protesters and prosecuted 2,285) (80 police officers were charged with violations by the IPCC) (But there were no criminal prosecutions) (Not being a voluntary first aider any longer) (Morning became a journalist in the front line) (Recording the truth) Hong Kong Independence! The only way out! We did a lot of things That we couldn't tell people, it was very hard But you've helped us document this Thank you They are smarter than me They're more wise and courageous than me Within one year The lessons I've learned, and the meaning behind it Is more than what I've gained in the last 80 years I don't think I've lost anything Maybe just time spent studying I don't think resistance or revolution is a sacrifice To fight is a part of life I've interviewed a 14-year-old boy once He had a high school classmate Who got stabbed in the stomach at the Lennon Wall There was a female classmate who got arrested Then she was threatened to be raped at the police station A 14-year-old kid Had to face these things everyday You can imagine It's the same with many high schools in Hong Kong I look forward to putting on my gear again I want to continue fighting with my brothers I want to be more courageous I really want to fulfill my mission The wishes for taking mask off at LegCo Was that hopefully when we've accomplished our mission We can have a huge celebration With this hope It can create a stronger motivation for everyone to fight Whenever I get frustrated When I want to quit, and leave this game I will revisit our movement Everything that's happened so far that makes me angry How they keep me angry Maybe even angrier That will keep me going To get the government to pay for their actions is my motivation Come on, it's just 10 years Just a decade So chill about it Everyone in prison would be from our generation We'd never be lonely in there I want my normal life back Enjoy going to a concert Going hiking I want a full time job I've never wanted a normal job so bad in my life Me too, I want to work so bad, it's crazy When the Jews left Germany They spent a few decades rebuilding their country Why can't Hong Kong do the same? The Jews did it Why can't Hongkongers do the same? Hongkongers are a group of excellent people To Hongkongers Hong Kong as a place is not important "You“ are important I've given everything for this cause Not for Hong Kong, but for Hongkongers For our next generation For our future I give my all I'm ready Since I will be tried in juvenile court My sentence may be shorter 10 years, I'll still be in my 20s when I get out of prison I'd still choose this path 5 Demands! (Not one less!) I'm 11 My family doesn't support me coming here In Wong Tai Sin, I was hit with a tear gas canister My eyes couldn't stop crying I kept drooling and my nose kept running It was unbearable Hongkongers have to "add oi|" There was a 10-year-old kid Maybe 11 or 12 years old, he was at the front line helping He was taking in tear gas, dodging rubber bullets Taking a beating from the police Adults should not keep hiding in the back For selfish reasons, they shouldn't continue To bury their conscience I really want all 7 million people to stand up And topple this regime This tyranny is too terrifying I can't take this any longer We've suffered for too many years I really don't have the courage to do this But I am so grateful that you guys Have sacrificed so much for Hong Kong I will always carry this guilt This bitter feeling, or whatever it is To keep on trying to do more for the cause Thank you so much No worries! Hongkonger! (Liberate Hong Kong. “Add oi|" Hongkongers) (The revolution of our times) (Together we stand) ("Add oi|"!) (2020 "Covid-19" has spread throughout the world) (In the name of fighting the pandemic) (HK government established a "restriction order") (To prohibit all demonstrations) (After "National Security Law" was enforced) (Nathan Law, Ted Hui and other opposition figures) (Went into exile overseas) (Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow, Jimmy Lai and others are imprisoned) (January 6, 2021) (Police arrested 53 opposition figures) (For subversion of state power including Benny Tai and Gwyneth Ho) (Both appear in this film as interviewees) (List of arrests under "National Security Law") (The list of people arrested continues to grow) We pledge: No more tears on our land In wrath, doubts dispelled we make our stand Arise! Ye who would not be slaves again For Hong Kong, may Freedom reign Though deep is the dread that lies ahead Yet still with our faith on we tread Let blood rage afield! Our voice grows evermore For Hong Kong, may Glory reign Star may fade as darkness fills the air Through the mist a solitary trumpet flares Now to arms! For Freedom we fight With all might we strike With valor, wisdom both, we stride Break now the dawn, liberate our Hong Kong In common breath: Revolution of our times May people reign, proud and free, now and evermore Glory be to thee Hong Kong
