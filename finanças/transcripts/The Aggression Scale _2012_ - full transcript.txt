Good to see ya, Boss. Back in this fuckin' place. Not much better than my cell. It's only for a couple days.right? Yeah...one way or another. This is the guy? No. this their lawyer. You do know that I'm convicted of murder, right? I'm out on bail on a million and a half dollars. I have 48 hours to pack up me and my kid, and find some non-extraditable country with good weather and cheap drinks, and you bring me the wrong fucking guy? Where's my money, Lloyd? I'm working on it. You're working on it? We have a list. People that worked with him. People that might have had access to the money. You're sure? He doesn't know about anything else? Now we don't have time to do this thing clean, Lloyd. So you get the guys and you go down this list and you kill them all. And then you find my money, understand? Wives, families, I don't give a fuck. Whoever stole one bent penny from my cash. Will do. Loud and messy, Lloyd. Loud and messy. I want to send them a message they don't fuck with me. And I want proof that you did the job. You earn your respect with this, and you'll be running the show from here on out. You fuck up, and the next guy get a piece of paper with your name on it. Here, it keeps real good time. You got 48 hours. Get in there! That's right. Does this look like a guy who just struck it rich to you? Me neither. He does look guilty though. Somebody gave you money that doesn't belong to you. No, no. I swear! I swear. Shut up! Freddie? 20 grand. Outta all that money? Cheap bastard. Nice to be out of the city. Out there on the open road. Here. Why don't you. why don't you work with this for a minute? I know it's a lot, all at once, kiddo. But I think it's the best thing for you. I mean look around. You have all this space and fresh air. Plus this will give us all a chance to get to know each other. I mean Maggie's fantastic, you know? And I'm sure you and Lauren will get along just fine. How you holding up? Is there something you want to talk about? Please leave me alone. Lauren, I-- What? What? Is there anything that I can say that's going to make us turn the car around and go back home? Honey-- I understand that this is a-- No. You don't understand. Listen, I'm dealing with this! Just really don't want to talk about it. Please leave me alone. Welcome home ladies. Ah, my goodness! Oh my god, look at all this space! Lauren? What do you guys think? You're out of your mind it you think I'm using that clothesline for laundry. Lauren, take your brother upstairs and help him pick out a bedroom. He's not my brother. Come on. They're going to be fine. There you go. All yours. Can you believe it? You're one lucky little kid. Knock yourself out. Mom, where do you want me to put the cleaning supplies? Uhh, just set them in the basement by the sink. Thank you. In case anything needs ant fixing. You got a tiny handyman in there? Stick around, you'll see what your man can do! I can't wait. I'm so tired I can't-- No, don't let it go! I told you. Oh come on, where's your can-do spirit? Look, she's right. Look you've messed up your arm. Come on, let's do this another time. Yeah? All right. Come on, honey. Ready, one, two, three, pull. This is so stupid guys, this isn't going to work. Heh. Hey sweetie, remember that weekend at the cabin? Hardwood floor, cheap wine, no mattress. Leave it. You guys are so gross. Sweetheart, you are going to have a completely different idea of gross when you get to be our age. Where's Owen? You're suppose to watch him. I was helping you move the mattress! Lauren, he's your brother now. Responsibility. Come on, help me find him. Don't worry about it. We'll figure it out. Ow. Owen? Owen, are down here? Owen? Owen? Owen? Hey, ding dong! What do I look like to you? Do I look like your babysitter? Cuz I'm not. My mom may have signed on for this bullshit, but I didn't. If you want it so bad, just take it. Does this whole spooky silent thing really work for you? Come on! We all good? Let's get this done. Se we can get home before our beds get cold, yeah? Hey Bigs, I'm gonna need receipts for the shells and the food. Seriously? Oh shit, no I got 'em. Hey! Guys... Road trip rules, all right? You need to make a call you go through me. Hey Elvis, What's up with the glasses? Is that what you're going with? For real? Oh don't. Don't what? I can see you getting all sentimental. It's a big deal for me. Us all being together like a family. Having Owen home again. It's a big deal for all of us. I mean look at you, you're climbing the wall right now. Well it's not like I really have anything else to do. I've been thinking about that. this can't be easy for you. And I think you deserve a reward. Bill, I thought we decided we were gonna wait. Fine. I've been thinking about this. You're 17 now, and I'm sure a lot of the other kids around here have one so, say when we finish tomorrow with the truck, I take you up the road to that place and maybe we find you a nice decent car. Seriously? Seriously. I mean living way out here you're going to need transportation. plus it'll really be a big help with Owen. [ banging on the door ] Why don't you take you brother and get him ready for bed? Bill?Mom, what's going on? You heard him. Take Owen upstairs. Come on twerp, let's get you in your PJ's. Is everything okay? Kay the realtor brought us some brownies. She said she's going to come by tomorrow with some groceries from town to get us started. Oh. I guarantee it's going to get easier. Wow, leaving already? You wanna talk about it? No. Can I ask you aquestion? Sure. Is this what you want for yourself? Is this what you want for me? I know that it's a lot for you to process. Us moving across town is a lot to process. You getting married to a man you don't even know, is a lot for me to process. But me coming home from school and finding all my stuff in boxes-- It's kind of complicated,Lauren! So why don't you explain it to me then? Jesus, Lauren. Six months ago I was a waitress. My life was a dead end until I met Bill. I mean, you know, life doesn't give you a lot of chances, but when it does you have to grab them. I just wanna go home. Well this is your home. Yes, it could be. Lauren... Hey, how 'bout just give it to night, huh? and tomorrow morning it's a new day, so fun, in our new house. Please, sweetie. Owen, it's me. Ready for bed? You're still gonna make with the silent treatment buddy? Look, I know it's not easy for you making the transition from that structure to all this freedom, a new place, Maggie, Lauren. I mean, I know it's gotta be tough. How are two getting along? Cut her some slack, okay? None of this is easy for her either. Come on hoss, time for the pills. Sit up. Look uh-- I'm rally proud of you buddy. You're really doing it. I mean, I knew you could. and I've been telling them for years but they don't listen. You keep up the good behavior, sky's the limit. Okay, we'll turn on the internet, and before we know it I'll have you shopping down at the car lot. Sounds good? I love you. Sleep tight. What the fuck are you doing back here? If bill knew you were up he'd shit himself. Get the fuck up to bed. Hold up. You got a tag. Something smells good. We're getting there. Hey Hon, did you find the rest of the kitchen boxes yet? What? We're going to be eating with our hands again if you don't find those boxes. [ knocking on the door ] I think the realtor lady's here again. Huh? Just... [ screaming ] What do you want? No! No! Maggie! [ screaming ] No! Wait, wait. Money! Bill! Please , don't... Babe? Wait, wait, wait! You've got the wrong people. No! Mom? Mom? No! No, no, no! Do I Bill? Get up! No! No! Fucker...Sit down! Get the kids. Get rid of the body. Six months, fuck! Sit the fuck down. What did you do with Mr. Bellavance's money? Listen, we just moved here. I don't know anything about any money. Neither did this guy. Or this guy. and this bitch didn't know anything about Mr. Bellavance's money either. I found this. Hello in there. Owen? Owen? Owen? Open the door. Please open the-- Hi. Oh no, looks like you got a boo boo. Owen, help! Aaaaah! Ah! Ah! Come on, you don't understand. Okay, my son is sick. He was in the hospital-- Oh no, I get it! Boss gets locked up you see your shot. It's a secret account, right? I mean who's going to come look for it but him. Look, I didn't, I didn't mean-- No you didn't mean to get caught. You didn't mean for Mr. Bellavance to get out. You certainly didn't mean for us to come knocking. What would you do for your son motherfucker? Owen, please. Ahhhh! Fuuuuuuck! Stay with him. It's those fucking kids. Watch out for the blades. Get yourself cleaned up. What's this? Ammo boo club? No! Fuck! Think they're gonna run? Gonna run, but they won't get far. One piece of business first. Wait. Wait. Outside in the truck there's a filing cabinet. The money's inside. and I can open it up and just-- Please, please leave my kids out of this. Bill, If we go out to that truck, and there's not a cabinet filled with cash, it's not going to be too late, paly. Not to find those kids, and make them see everything that we're gonna do to you. So? Are you lying to me, Bill? Owen, we have to go! Owen, come on. Shit. Shit, shit, shit. Let's go! Come on! Open it up. Come on. come on. Open 'em. Shit. Come on, open 'em. Here we go, ready?Go, go, go, go. Little sting. Fuck! Ah! Fuck! Come on. Get in there! Yeah, I saw a box that said medical. Here it is. I think I'm gonna puke. You're not gonna puke. How the fuck do you know? Oh shit. You have 60 seconds to open it up. Aw, come on! What the fuck you doing? Bill. You should've left us alone. Drop it. You knew you took that money, someone was gonna come looking for it. My god. I don't want any trouble. Owen, let's go. Owen, what the fuck are you doing? Come on! What the fuck happened? These fucking kids! They're a problem. Well where'd they go? Down in the woods. Well go and find 'em before they find someone to tell their story to. I'll stay here and look for the cash. Hey look Lloyd, you don't understand. When we were in the house we found this box-- Was it full of money? No, but the kid-- Stop fucking wasting time and go find the fucking kids! Fuck. Ah! Owen! Owen, it hurts so bad! [ inaudible ] [ whimpering ] Yeah. Lloyd, I was just wondering if you had the time. Where the fuck are you, Lloyd. Look, you know what, I don't wanna know. Just tell me you got the money. We found the guy. And? We're working on it boss. Lloyd, I gave you two days. I'm sitting here in this dingy-ass trailer with my kid, and we're waiting on you! You have that money here tonight, or my last act as a free man is gonna be sending some guys after your ass! You hear me? Lloyd, you hear me? Lloyd-- Christ. What?Look at this. What is this? School bullies. Look like they pushed our boy one step too far. Kid pretends to run, gets them alone, bam. That one last and eye, the other one, he might walk again someday. I don't know. Fuck. Doctor said he wasn't showing improvement. Recommended sending to an adult lockdown facility. And then boom, he just got out. What happened? Bellavance's money happened. Our buddy Bill bought his wackjob son a get-out-of-jail free card. Shit. How dangerous is this kid? Who cares? We just need to get that money and get the fuck outta here. About that... We gotta get those kids. Did you see that? What? I thought I saw something move up there. Does this seem worth it to you, man? Shhh! Come on, man, I'm serious! You read the file. What do you want, let those kids get away? No, I wanna go home. I wanna see my wife, and then I wanna see my girlfriend. We've got a job to do, or neither one of us are getting out of here alive, okay? Yeah but what you don't understand is this shit, this this is not the job! No the job is shut the fuckup and keep your eyes peeled! Come on. Oh shit, look. Just pick it up. Uh! Fuck! Jesus Christ! You okay?Get the fucking kids! Aaaah! [ screaming ] Doesn't sound like he's dead. Maybe the little bastard doesn't the sack to kill a man. Lloyd. You think he might not be trying to kill us? What's he trying to do then? Might be trying to have fun with us. Sorry I'm running late, but I brought the groceries. Are you friends with Mr. Rutlidge? Yeah, yeah. We're, uh, we're just helping him move. Is Mr. Rutlidge here? Yeah, he's around back. Is there anything I can help you with? I was just dropping these, by, but I can do that some other time. Get in the car, Freddie! Hi. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going? You got a stick, good, come on. You little fuck! Come here, you little fuck. Just fuckin' think this is fun, huh? You little fucking games! Where you going? Get up. Get up! Come on. Come on buddy. It was a good run, kid. [ yelling ] Aaaaah! Aaaah! Stay away from me! We made it. Come on. What? Do you see something? Owen? Owen, come on. I don't wanna go. Owen? Shit. Shit. What are you doing? You freak. [ whistling ] Freddie! Go get her! You used me as bait? Come on! Come on! Get in! You have five minutes to tell me where the rest of the money is. Was it worth it? All the shit you've been through. All the people that died for this fucking money. Was it worth it? You tell me. Money's not worth dying for. Tell that to your friends. What are you gonna do when you find it? My job. Really? Yeah. I'm not stupid enough to cross Mr. Bellavance. You're not smart enough. Bill and my mom saw a chance they took it. They died for it. Yeah, well at least they we rich for a minute. You're just an errand boy. You're wasting time. No. No I'm not. I'm buying it. I don't have time for this bullshit. Holy shit! What the fuck. Lights out motherfucker. Can you fucking believe this shit? Lloyd? Fuck! Fuck you kid! Aaaaah! Don't you hear the door?Come on. Hey, what do you want? Hey, come on back here!
