Shut the gates before all children enter! You stink. Damn school! What I was ? Hi The gate is locked. Is the Gladstein Rachel's mother. Try to get the time in "Bloody school"! It is very unpleasant. Did not say goodbye? Floret! The last teacher told me about you, but I still would like you to do a personal description, like every year. Sit down, then. Can someone please give place to Rafaela? Is Rachel. As for Marina Campbell I want you to support in their time of grief. As you may know, his mother left us recently. Okay, Marina? A place to Rafaela, only is delayed and is not a leper!

They are tasty, too. Does Catherine took a box just to be polite? It looks nice. More than a woman can be. Surely she can drink. My uncle said that no woman, widowed or unmarried never set foot in his house. You do not seem to care. Well, I could not shoo it. I never let go. Valérie is a bit rough, is not it? It's a bit bold. Shit, shit! This kitchen is a fiasco! I'll put it back. Remember, it's hot. Pass me... Pass me here. Ladies, can I help you? Hey, gypsy Barbie! I'm going to change my math test. Are you coming?

I want to have long hair as Marina Campbell. A smart girl like you not need such devices. My mother always controlled my hair. She knows better! She did not want me to be vain. You would have stolen its thunder. Valérie invited me to sleep at her house. Very kind, but could's annoy her mother. Why can not she? You said yourself that she is fearless So what? That's no reason. She never slept in another place other than your home There's always a first time for everything Or you could me enroll in the Club of Friends of Barbie. Club of Friends of Barbie? Yes. You can win luxurious prizes. E Barbie write you letters and become your friend. Do you want to pay to turn friend of a plastic doll with dirty blonde hair and nylon hair? They will not let me play free with real girls. Stop being spoiled. At your age, I gained an orange at Christmas. He always says: "At your age..."! How do you think happened to him then? It was fun at first. Why would it be fun to his father at the beginning He was the youngest of his family. So, what happened. All of them were sent to Auschwitz and they all died except my father. who returned on their own barefoot in the snow striped pajamas. You know, Rachel, these events in his father's life must have been very difficult. I think not. I'm glad you're doing justice to my present. Who is it? "The Sahel Cry". I'm very proud of you, Floret. It is rare to feel compassion for others, at your age then, is fantastic. Club of Friends of Barbie It almost deserves its membership to the Barbie Club. Only over my dead body! Good night. Do you mind if I turn back on you? - Berenice? - Apples. Apples, yes. Apples. How To Stay Slim. The way doctors want Another food that is good to you? Filled? Not Manon? Lettuce. With that ass, it must drink water and vomit! If it is interesting, Rafaela, tell the class. To stay healthy, you should eat apples and suck cocks. Both to the principal's office! Valérie... To get lean, you should... ...eat apples. Yes, and? Pears. And? Take water. What else? Suck pears... Sorry. Dicks, not pears. That's enough! Where they hear these things? Not to excuse his attitude, but... true that Mrs. Danielle wear clothes "daring"... Generating comments unsuitable for children. She has very nice clothes. Nothing justifies its position. She wears clothes too elegant. I like the fur coat rabbit sleeveless. Mr... Pineau. Mr. Pineau... the rabbit skin undoubtedly suits her, but is, however, an incitement to sex. But I think girls must be punished. Then copy 100 times: "not sucking pears"! Hi, Mrs. Parisi, is the mother of Rachel. We were using the first names? Oh, yes, sorry. How could you not go, I want to tell you about the incident at school. Valérie already told me. Did you notice that she knows the phrase "suck dicks?" I know Brother she teaches. What can you do? Got I do not know whether to believe but Rachel did not say "suck dicks' but "suck pears"? "Suck pears"! "Suck dicks," Mom, not "pears". Valérie would Rachel would sleep here. Could come after school. That's very kind of you, but... I have a symposium tomorrow, unfortunately, so it can happen my mother's need of Rachel. Then, with his hemiplegia, I worry for her.

Your mother? No, your mother! She said that Rachel was bored. In view of the time, I packed a swimsuit and gloves! Goodbye, beautiful. Back at the station, please. At the station? There are no trains till tomorrow. I see this lady as a grandmother, but it's strange. She said, "You know, I know." When you were born, I knew everything about you. She starts to cry. I took her in my arms. I was so uncomfortable. And then... she starts shaking. It's scary. Why? She said her daughter died in an accident. She went under a truck and his head was cut off. Yuck! I shivered, because I have a scar on my neck. Where is it? Here, look. See? You can see it? Right there. You can see it? Te wrong, right? Worked, right? Girls may leave the table. Come on, decapitate spiders to make potions! You widow? No. I am divorced. My husband was very young to deal with children. Do you blame him? Not That does not do any good. He loved me when he left. I was sad but calm. You know if he was cheating on you? It occurred to me, but... I prefer to trust people even disappoint me, rather than suspect. I'm not as generous as you. Why do you say that? You need to be very sure of herself to... see her husband wastes his life arranging the kitchen of a woman... it is... seductive are you single. Do you still love him? I do what I can. I'm not perfect. I am not a hero. I am an ordinary woman Which is getting fat... that does not make love because... your partner is aging and... at least I am lucid. So you should know he loves you very much. How can you be so sure? As a single woman, I can detect men who show as available. It is not available. Michel loves you. Perhaps more than you love. Michel has his life ahead. What can happen to surprise a woman like me now? He could leave her. Right... Anyway, my father can not have sex with women. How did they do then? They slept together. They had sex, then! No, my father can not show anyone your brand. Why not? Because of "Osvicht". Who is "Osvicht"? You can not understand. It is a place for Jews. Doubt. Is. Yes! They are a good influence each other. At least they do not are bored. Farewell Colette. You have amazing breasts. - Are you in love? - Me? By whom? For my brother. Yes. I love your father. You're crazy! Your hyper-big heart is freaking out! Hypertrophic, Miss. jealous! Forget, you have no chance! Thank you! I can not tell you have a chance with my brother. Why yes, I have a chance. You? No way. He has a girlfriend. Good night. Father. They had good times? I need to pee. Long was the trip? 314 km. Coluche you heard the program on the radio? He's great. Let's see how long it will last the program. Do you mind if I turn back on you? On the contrary! It me or is it hot? Quite... cucumbers! And then? I can see! I do not know if it's real. I see a white goddess with stunning eyes. So you're cured! Johnny is in school. The teacher says: "Say A". He does not say. The teacher says again: "Say A". It does not mean A. Then, the teacher plays the his bag out the window. He's going around saying, "A-A-A!" Good joke. - I'm not hungry. - Is not? Why not? Yes, you are. I'm hungry! Not in front of Rachel I do not care. Valérie and I saw Mrs. Danielle having sex behind with the gym teacher. Gender behind? Yes! He pulled her hair and pulled her bra! Doggy style. Surely she cried. What? It's not as bad as "Osvicht"! Is Michel Gladstein talking . My daughter attended an improper scene. She saw her teacher in a compromising position with the gym teacher Believe me, I am not someone who denounces people, but you must admit which is embarrassing. So I'll let you decide what steps to take. Do you think it's my fault Mrs. Danielle fired No, she sucked the pear the gym teacher Her husband "softened" and she lost a tooth . mistreated, not "softened" Does the Tooth Fairy will bring another to her I do not know. Perhaps new panties with rabbit fur You'll never guess what happened to me You went out with my father? I'm in the hospital A appendicitis with a general anesthetic. Go to operate me soon. You know what I eat for 3 days Caramel cream! You're so lucky Can I go see her? No, children can not enter. You are a child. Yes, but I am sick, my dear! You want to know the best thing? What? I got skates, a robot and a typewriter Petite International If you lend me your machine writing Petite International, I'll lend you my father. He's already ancient history. I love doctor now. It is the most beautiful man I know. He could be your father. It could also be your father. I'll pretend to sleep not to take injection. Goodbye, gypsy Barbie! Goodbye, mini dwarf. Goodbye, old shit. Goodbye, sick cream caramel! Goodbye slice of meatball for a cat pee on it! Goodbye... tadpole sticky with the wrinkled bag. Injection Time. That's very kind, but... Does it hurt? Not much. But it is not very convenient. I eat puree, soup, chopped ham... I feel like a baby. Have you tried alphabet soup? You do not have to bite, and you can write words with them. What kind of words? Funny words. It was made to write intellectual novels. You've read a lot of them? Not many. Oh, yes, I read "Sissi, the Empress." I saw the movie, then they made one of his books. "Thithi"... "Sissi", not "Thithi"! I can not say that! Ridiculous! I see you still have your emergency supplies. As in September, when you brought a picnic. Do you remember? You do not go unnoticed. Dear Mrs. Trebla, Mom told me that as I not sleep with my backpack now, I do not need see you When you have small concerns now, I can speak directly with Mom and Dad. Thus man very loves his wife. The woman that he, the man, married. Together they decide to give yourself a hug. A very special hug. If I'm in love with someone, I have children? Absolutely not. You must be pubescent. When? Around 12 years. I can not expect to have 12 years to have children. Not 12. Not until you have 20. 20! Why not make it a nun? 16 is right, dear. 16? Take it to Family Planning! - 19 can be. - No, 17. 18! 18. E at 15? You aborts! What is abortion? It is a tricky word. I say 22. Yes, 22 is fine. Catherine, how are you? I was going to call you. How is the little convalescent? You can not die of appendicitis There were complications . His heart was weak But the doctor could have done their best. I'm sure did everything he could. Where is she now It is... with her mother. I can see her. Not. No, honey, you... you do not can see her. You're too small. Valérie is very small too. Mrs. Trebla, I'm sad. Much sadder than have been from very small What me leaves even sadder... is that life goes on around me. Valérie is dead but is as if nothing had happened And I still feel the wind in my calves. Dear Mrs. Trebla, hope Valérie not have known he was dying, and even had time to be afraid. Even though she was a bit bold, was not at all true when said he was not afraid of anything I'm afraid, mainly to forget every detail, of all the things we did together I do not interacted with Valérie for long time, so maybe the only memories I'll have when be adult... will be the picture of our breasts. I think no one should die when a child. I think it should happen much later, when more or less accept, even when it makes you sad Mrs. Trebla, I know Valérie is dead and I'll never see her again... but still, I wanted to ask... Does she still exist? Mrs. Delasux sticks... Dicks, not pears The Dandelions (THE WIND IN MY CALVES) Subtitles: Walter Santos
