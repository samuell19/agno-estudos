An Argo Pictures, lnfini & Vap Presentation Directed by Shiori Kazama I came out here on a school trip in 4th Grade. Kids get bored in a place like this. Yeah? I've always liked this kind of place. Well, I was bored here. So in Free- Activities time we started a fired. Were you cold? No. We just found a disposable lighter. Did they have those things way back then?. Just listen, OK? We got some dry branches but we forgot... ... to think about where we were setting it. The grass around it caught fire. The teacher managed to put it out before the whole place went up. Stupid! Guess you always were, huh? You've got... ... rice on you. Time to get going. Already? It's not Tuesday. It's your fault for making me come out on a Sunday. Makiko Kuno Fumiyo Kohinata Mami Nakamura CANON ON TUESDAY I'll come up. You' re supposed to be home. Well, yeah... And there's our rule... That was fun. Let's do it again. Next time let's go to a hot spring or something. Do you mean that? Sure! See you Tuesday. See you. Apartment to Let Look into my eyes... 'If you pick up... '... a million one-yen coins... '... you will have... "... a million yen. There. So what?. The answer is inside you. It is? Yes. If you say so. Thank you very much. Good luck. Come back and bring a friend. Lotsa luck You didn't ask her phone number?. Her? I' ve got standards, you know! Fraud! It's better than being unemployed and homedless. A fraud needs talent, too. Youlve got nn customers. Go get me some, then. Too embarrassing. I don't need it. Here comes a prospect. Welcome! How ared you? It' s been ages. You know her?! You and Mrs Komatsu were about to kill each other last time I saw you. That stupid old cow!. Hey, what's going on?. Introduce me!. Kinuko. I know her from my last-but-one job. Manabe the Fraud. Oh, you're a fraud?. No!. I work the streets, easing the sufferings of wounded hearts. He' s an idiot. Ignore him. Look into my eyes. I have it! This is you. Wow... I guess. I should pay you... No, thank you! That's honest and real. The words just came to me. An intedresting boyfriend... We' re just childhood friends. Shel s crashing at my place. Kind of like a cousin. Anyway, why don' t we all go for a drink? Thanks, but I can' t. It's Tuesday. Why? Is Tuesday unlucky? What are they selling?. Here's why. Oh. "lt's too bright to see. I need sunglasses for my heart. I stand behind that. It's written wrong. There's a meaning to that. Shall we go? Good luck. Careful! Are you OK? All right?. Do you knnw that guy? No. He' s pretty old. I might have a chance. Thank you. You had a date last night, didn' t you. How do you know? The satisfied look on your face. And the mosquito bites on your neck. Stop it, Mrs Komatsu! It' s past quitting time, you know. You're right! I' ll be going, then. Hi. We're here to buy tickets. Hello. Do you like music? Let' s all go see a band. Sure. I know one that' s sort of cool and laid-back. Kind of Brazilian and jazz. When?. Tuesday. I told you, Tuesday's no good. Why?. You can go out with him any day of the week. I'm afraid I can't. He must bed a busy guy... ... if he can only see you once a week. Let me worry about that. Don't be like that! You're lonely, aren't you. None of your business. Leave me alone. But if you're going out with someone you want to be with them. We're not young kids. Is that all? Tuesdays are out, that's all. some other day. He's got another girlfriend... No? Maybe. I know! Infidelity! Don't call it that. I see! That's very grown-up, Isn't it. Don't do it. Infidelity is wrong. It's cheating. Infidelity's wrong. It's "cheating". What are you talking about? You can't love two people at the same time. Love is between two people, but infidelity involves a family. Thatls what Hijiri says. You know what her problem is?. She talks too much. Surely you're not letting that bother you... No. Kinuko... ... I know I can' t do everything I should for you. But... ...I love you. Isn't that enough? Your wife' s very passionate. Tooth marks. That's my daughter. She's into biting. Come in with me. You know... ...itls not wise to get too good at hide-and-sedek. Knowing when to get caught is an important life sKill. A woman should know that. I don't play hide-and-seek. That's a kids game. Oh. Men are all jerks. Grow up to be a fine woman... ...and twist them around your little finger. If I have to be a woman, just once I want to be madly in loved. Mom says that. what does it mean?. Thanks. Did you find a new job? Nothing I want to do. Hijiri just won' t compromise over anything. These pickles are good. Where did you buy them? I made them. It' s weird... cooking is thed one thing she' s good at. They're really good. Let' s not go out. Why not?. Let' s make something and eat here. You can teach me to cook. That' s a good idea. Letl s do that. OK? No. Why not?. You just want to cook for that guy. What's wrong with that?. It's no skin off your nose. I stili don't want to. All right, then.. ... I want to try your cooking. Lettuce... lettuce... Next, cucumbers and tomatoes... Broccoli... This one is bigger, Kinuko. And the meat' s inside. What about sake Let' s do sake tno. And this. Daddy, come on! "Take me along on a trip to Mars..." You can't sing, Daddy Kinuko! Hi. Getting ready for a feast? Is that lady angry Maybe. You're terrible! Yep, she' s angry. Letl s go. Bye-bye. Kinuko! l'm sorry. Let's do it another time. I'm going homed. No! Who cares about him? Sorry. No!. You'll feel better when we start cooking. Leave me alone If he depresses you that easily, it's stupid to stay with him! I'm stupid. I'm easily depressed. I can't leave him. Do you understand that? Hey, Kinuko! Hi! This is Manabe! I'm not here. Helllo? Hello? Helllo? Hello? Hello? Hijiri? Hiriji! Get up! Hello? Hijiri! Hijiri! Hello. Hijiri?. It's me. Rejoice! I've gotten Iucky. No! Why would it be Kinuko? It's a high-school chick. We're in a potential "eat at home situation here... " ... so I'd like you to make yourself scarce. Well, think of something, OK?. Thanks. Crashers don' t have rights. Donl t make me kick you out. Welcome home. You' re early. Don' t you have a date tonight? Yeah, I'm going now. But what are you doing here?. Therels beer and stuff in the fridge. Help yourself. I appreciate this. What do you think? I just bought it. You' ll fredeze in that. What is it about that old guy?. His feet look like they stink. If you want to stay here, shut up. Sorry. Use the bath if you like. I'll be late, so don't wait up. Be seeing you. Have fun. Sorry l' m late. The usual. Sorry. That's OK. You should' ve eaten something. I' m not hungry... You' re burning hot! You shouldn't have come. Yeah, but... Why don' t I take you home? Why don' t you get something to eat?. Sakes not good for you. You' re not having a good time. Let's forget it tonight. You should be home in bed. I'll drive you home. I'm not going home. I'll go drink somewhere by myself. Is she OK? Guess so. Hi. Oh, that' s right... you're here. Make me something that goes with wine, will you? What happened?. Just shut up and make something, freeloader! if you like. What? It ended up like you said. Satisfied? Kinuko?. Are you all right?. Leave me alone. Yes... Yes... Yes... I' m sorry. I'II be better soon. Yes... Yes... I' ll be back as quick as I can. Tell Mrs Komatsu l' m sorry. Yes... Goodbye. Kinuko, I made some soup. Nothing too heavy. I don't want any. I feel horribie. My head hurts! Come on... sit up and eat this. There. Don't mother me. I' m staying here till youl re bedtter. If that's OK with you. Hijiri, why are you being so nice to me? The one who should be here for you isn' t coming. You' d be all alone. What' s that? I'm visiting a sick friend. Kinuko! It's Manabe! The best medicine for a cold! Stupid! I am not stupid. Come inside. Thank you... excuse me... Hi, there. In high school I went out with Hijiri' s older sister. She was a lot prettier. She is not! Her eyeds are too narrow. When love is over, friendship remains. Or something like that. It makes for a good story. I get 500,000. Take it. 37.6. The fever's down. Can I get up?. I'm tired of being in bed. No, you can't. It was so funny...Manabe used to sneak into my sister's room... ...through the upstairs window. Once he had to leave with no pants so my father wouldn't catch him! Shut up! Don't tell her that! That's an even better story. Damn right! so be careful of him. Yes? Is Kinuko here? Go away. Why?. No visitors. Wait a minute!. Sorry. Should you be out?. It's not Tuesday. I' ll stay with her now. So could you go?. What gives you the right to say that?. I'm sorry. Could you? Let's go. Where?. Come on. Hope you're better soon, Kinuko. Good night. Wow!. With that appetite, I guess you' re OK. What? It's like a dream. You here with me. You must be delirious with fever. Are you going? No! You'll catch my cold Give it to me and you won' t have it any more. Good night. What should I take in first? Anything. Hello. I moved in next door. Come have some soba noodles. What happened?. Did you two have a fight? Nothing like that. Thank you. Sorry. If we both want to go to the toilet, he never lets me go first. Then he stays in there forever. And he never cleans. Now I feel that l' m my own woman at last. You may feel that way now, but you'll soon start to get lonely. I will not! Yes, you will. Youlre the type. You get lonely, don't you? I mean, that guy's always gone home by morning. What can I do?. If I love someone, I want to be with them all the time. To tell you the truth, he wasn't supposed to be here. We had a rule. It gets hard to keep things separate. He' s gone, but the bed's still warm, and his smell's still there. Once that happens, things you never worried about before... ... start to bother you. Did you wish you were married? You' re 29, single, home alone sick... it' s only natural. You did wish you were married, didnl t you. No, I didn' t. You did! It' s all over your face. No, it' s not. It is! It's written there in great big letters. What if I said I saw your husband arm-in-arm with another woman? It's quitting time. Good night. What's up? I came for you. Hop on. Put your bag in here. We' ve got to hurry. Ready?. Here we go. Where are we going? It' s a secret. I'm getting nervous! I'll bet! Give me a hint. It' s a secret. How far is it?! Just up to the roof. I hate stairs! I grew up in the mountains. When things went wrong, l' d always look at the stars. But here you can hardly see any of them. I thought up on a skyscraper roof l' d be closer to them. Stupid, huh?. You still can't see any stars. But it' s great! It' s like wel re floating in the sky. Wel re the only ones who know about this place. Thank you, Hijiri. That was good! Seed? You know how to pick them. One more place!. I don't wanna. Why not?. Let's call it a night. Oh, come on! Careful! You're no fun! Next time I'll show you some more places. HEY TRAIN! WANNA RACE? Kinuko! You'll never catch it! Oh, thanks. Kinuko... ... you'll get snot all over it. Kinuko... ... give it up What? You know what. Don't start that now. we're having a good timed. You' re not having a good time. You're suffering! Just walk away from all that awful cheating. Youlll be happier. Will you stop calling it "cheatingl'? If I hated it that much, l'd've ended it long ago. I've had enough of being lectured. You donl t understand anything, so spare med all your talk, will you? It's not talk. It is so! Have you ever really been in love with someone? Yes, I have. Liar! It's the truth. I'm in love with someone now and I can't t do anything I'm in agony, you know. It's not just talk. Who? It's not Manabe, is it. So that's it... So that' s why you' ve been so nice to me... You want me to drop Kohei for you! All you care about is getting what you want. No. Yes! You know what?. You make me sick. Good morning. Kinuko... Kinuko! Yes? It's past quitting time. Hi, Kinuko. You're early tonight. Must be nice, though... a date Wherel s Hijiri?. i havenl t been able to reach her. Write. What? The right words for me now, of course. Sure... but I didn' t think you liked this stuff very much. Like this, I guess... "what you'd really... "...Iook good in... 'I...is a mini-skirt. " That's dumb. I knew it! Manabe... ...taked me back to your place. Sure. One more. Did you know about Hijiri? Sort of, I guess. I don't really understand her. I' m kind of slow. The one thing I do know is she' s not interested in me. I put the moves on her four times, and four times I went down in flames. Well, once for some reason it seemed to be going all right... ... and it looked like I was in, but it didnl t happen. But welre still good friends. I don't get it. It's all right, you know. Even if you never come back here, I'm still the same old Manabe. Oh, hi. He left. He was here for quite a while, though. Donlt worry about it. Things happen, I guess. Here you go. Thank you. Do you do bookings for hot springs?. I want a nice place to spend a couple of nights. Not a family place. Somewhere you' d take a girlfriend. I was afraid you'd caught cold again. As a matter of fact, l... I don' t care what you do when youl re not with me. We' ll go to a hot spring, OK?. To.. Mrs Kohei Deguchi Don' t you think this is a dirty trick?. It' s squealing! And using a little girl is way over the top. Here she comes. You're not really going to do this, are you? Hi. Kinuko's gone to work I came to see you. You know why. Serves you right. It' s strange...my wife doesnl t usually work overtime. But yesterday I got home before her and intercepted this. Why are you being such a damn nuisance? Are you on some morals committee? I donl t care about morals. Then why? I want to steal her. I want Kinuko. You do? I see... So that's it... But... you haven't got a chance. Because l' m a woman? Hell, no. That happens all the time. Then why? I know her better, and she needs me more than she needs you. We' ll see about that! I won't Iet you have her. What are you doing? I won't give up. Show me. I want her to need me. Show me everything you do for her. Show med how you please her. You're interesting. In different circumstances, we could be friends. But sorry. I couldn't get it up with you. I couldn't show you the main thing. But you' re nice. Best of luck. Um... Yes? Can I borrow some detergent? Thanks. Um... ...I'm sorry. I dnn't want to hear that. I'm not going to change. You can have the detergent. I'll give you anything I have. Let's start with the outdoor bath. We'll go in at least twice a day. Not enough. At least three. We'll sit in the bath and have a drink... Yeah! We need some good local sake And we'll do it a lot. Maybe even in the outdnor bath. OK! More than three times? Illl do my best. I'm glad we came. Yep. So am l. Kohei Deguchi Kinuko Deguchi The key to your room... If I beat you at ping-pong... What? You have to obey me. Completely?. We' ve never had dinner like this before. Like in our own house... I love you. I want to play ping-pnng. OK. If I win, you'll do what I say? Then marry me. Give me a break! Just kidding! Let's play. Is this fun? No. Win a point, will you?. We'll be here all night. You do it! Don't you want to win? This is just like us. How? Just maintaining, so that no one wins or loses. I don't understand. Yes, you do. You know everything il m thinking. I want to be with you forever. I'm not going home. Let's just stay Iike this. Hello? What's wrong?. Oh? I can't Ieave yet... My wife. It's OK. She thinks I'm on a business trip. And?. My daughter's got the 'flu. It's pretty bad. Go home. Go home. Will you come, too?. i like the outdoor bath. I'll stay till tomorrow. Weren't you going to be away till tomorrow? Sorry, no souvenir. I'm making dinner. Would you like some?. Hello? I'm hungry. I'm starving. I need to eat something. Right! I' ll make you something. I' ll be right over! One day on the street he askedd me for directions. We were going the same way, so we walked togedther. We started talking and suddednly he said... ...'Maybe I won't go, and asked me into a place we were passing. I thought he was a jerk, but I said, 'What the hell. ' He thinks if he says he loves me that I just melt. The silly fool doesnl t realize that I never have. He's sleazy, half-assed about everything... A boring old bald guy with a hard- on. When the light hits his forehead he looKs like a flounder. He'd be like kissing an over-ripe melon! Hey... ... are there any good bands around? Let me know if there are. i' m free next Tuesday. I' m sorry. Don't leave me alone. It's all right. I' ll never leave you alone. Hey! I brought you this. If I may... Even if it's rented, it's still a real house. More like "family" than "living together". Or maybe a 'Ilove nest"? And aren' t you going to live with that girl? We' ve only known each other a month. And she doesn't t really like the idea. Youl ve changed. Matured. Il ll get more of this. Thank you. Is my Daddy here? Where' s Daddy? Mom found out Daddy was cheating and got real mad. Daddy said he wasn't cheating aay more, but Mom didn't believe him. So Daddy got mad and last night he went away. Which one of you is his girlfriend?. Why did you bring her here? She followed me!. Daddy' s coming here, isn' t he? When is he coming? Did you call him?. I' ll take you home. Drink that and we' ll go. No! I' m not going till Daddy gets here!. He's not coming here, I told ynu! Well, let' s eat. You must be hungry. What have you got? I hate onions. Get to work. You don't eat for free. Here. Aren't you being a little rough? No, I'm not. Daddy! Welcome home. What are you talking about?. We've been worried sick! Sorry about this. Let's go. Dinner's ready... I'm hungry. This is just like our house No one talks when they eat That's not true. We have fun when we eat. Don't we. Are they a family?. Kind of. Daddy, did you get dumped?. Don't be silly! Thank you. Thank you. It's getting late. Byed-bye. Eat your onions. What? Nothing. I'll make coffee. Miss me? I missed you. I'm not leaving. What's wrong?. A nightmare? It's all right now. No... it wasn't a nightmare. It was a really happy dream. All we ever sing... ... are stupid love songs. All we ever sing... ... are songs like this. "l love you. " It's all a bunch of crap... ... Like you hear all the time All the songs we ever... ...hum to ourselves... ... are tarted-up love songs. "I lo ve you"... That's all we can say. We don't know any other words. But in words... ... what can you say? I don't know any good songs... ... Iike some people I might mention. When i feel blue... ... I could murmur your name... ... but what would that get me? "I love you"... That's all we can say. We don't know any other words. But in words... ... what can you say? No matter how long I live... ... I'll never be able to say it right. All we ever sing... ... are stupid love songs... ... that go something like this: "Chala cha chala l... "Chala cha chala love you... "Chala cha chala l... "Chala cha chala love you...
