You have only 3 more hours to sleep. Yes, sir, I just felt like showering. OK, Miller, go ahead. Miller. Its better to dry off after showering, we don't want sick soldiers. Is that clear? Yes, sir. Sheets from home, a hot shower, tough life. If I was home now, I'd take my yellow rubber duckie, take a bubble bath with lots of bubbles. Then I'd take some milk and cookies, get into bed, snuggle under the covers and feel great. With no lieutenant who just ruined my shower. Did you shower together? -Sure. I dont understand why he hates me.. Not that again. -But he really does hate me. OK, enough. -Go to sleep. Goodnight, tigers. Guard us well! Mali! -He's such and idiot. Mali, Mali. -Who is it?

Good morning sir! Okay, platoon no. 1 we are moving north. Within a half an hour we have to take apart the equipment and load it on the bus. If you stay on schedule, you will have a short leave in Jerusalem. Any questions? Okay. Sir? Are we going to Lebanon? I said we were going north. More questions? Half and hour. Guys, newspapers! Mali, make sure the newspapers get back here. Hey, throw a paper over here! Bring the sports page over here! Shira don't have school on Thursdays. As a former Jerusalemite What's to do there? Don't know. -Shira has a new roommate. I hear she's cute. -OK. OK. Well find something to do. Maybe go stick notes in the western wall. Tour the old city. Maybe my mother is in town. She has meetings in Jerusalem. Look at this, in one day three guys killed! I intend to fuck over 20 of theirs for everyone of ours. And I personally hope you won't fuck over anyone. Because if Rahamin is lying five meters underground, he won't care how many PLO you've fucked over. A real goody-goody, You pity the terrorists, eh? I don't want to go to Lebanon and get hit by an R.P.G. Because someone like you can't wait to kill some Arabs. Hold on, I want to kill them? They want to kill me! Who started this whole mess in first place? What about the bombing in Kiryat Shemona? Half of my family lives there. They don't sleep at night. All day in bomb shelters. These guys live in Tel Aviv, they don't give a fuck. A cow from our farm got killed. Ran into a minefield. War is no answer and Begin wants to stick us there for good. What are you, "Peace Now"? Bring me the recruit leader. Recruit leader! -Recruit leader to the lieutenant! Leave me out of it. -Don't bother with those lefties. You don't even know what Right and Left means, So cut the crap. This government is sick. Were not supposed to argue politics in the army, so everybody shut up! You'd even give them Jerusalem, would'nt you? Shut up Gazuli. Come on, Yonatan Miller, play us a happy song. Something for the heart. "If the night is dark, and no star shines for me, "and if the sea is stormy. "Oh mother, on the mast of my ship, "light a rose of fire. "And if the sky has faded with sadness, "and the thread of dawn is thin. "Oh mother, reach out a warm hand, hold me close, "and heart will strengthen heart. "A canopy of gold above, beneath an endless abyss. "Waves carry me, carry me, to the land of my dreams. "Carry me safely don't ask me why. "A little bird awaits me on the horizon. "If the night is still dark, and no star shines for me, "and if the sea is stormy. "Oh mother, on the mast of my ship, "light a rose of fire." Forty nine. Its the death number. Get it and you stay behind to guard. One, two, three, four, five, six..
