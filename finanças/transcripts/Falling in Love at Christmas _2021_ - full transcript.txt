Right 'cause, you know, That's a political statement, isn't it? Yeah. Uh, all I'm saying is just be cautious. Okay, so... What, make a fake profile? Um... Yeah, like, Mr. Claus?

Okay, you gotta go. - call me after. - yeah. ♪ Christmas, Christmas is here♪ Hey. Hey! Would you like to try my... Hey! Would you like to try the gift recommendation app, Giftverse? How does it work? Giftverse analyzes A person's social media account Along with other info To suggest the perfect gift. Like that app, the present ninja. Oh, no, we don't push mass-produced junk. We actually link to local businesses And independent artists. High-quality gifts. You just want to enter your name And the recipient's name right there. I never know what to get my sister. Well, with machine-learning algorithms I might be able to help you with that. Oakwood exercise bike? We still have some bugs to fix... - Uh hm. - I'm sorry. You're not following the script. Do... Do you need a t-shirt? I worked a summer in college selling phones. I usually start with, "hey, can I ask you a question-" Can I have my phone back?! This isn't our, uh... Do you usually go around plucking strangers' phones? -Who are you? -Who are you?! Paul Dennis, present ninja CEO. Oh, "Christmas brought to you by..." "present ninja, the gift-giving app." Let me ask you a question. You ever get someone a gift They didn't like? No. Okay, well, our app Is going to disrupt bad gift-giving Using technology.

Sample? -Take it. -No, I insist. -It's yours. -You take it! -I can't. -Why not? -Take it. -You take it. Oh, thank you. Mm! Mmm... Your voice sounds really familiar. Well, maybe you saw an interview of me. I'm Miranda McCauley. Giftverse founder? Your app rival. I'm sorry. I thought you were... One of your corporate lemmings? wow, I'm getting the you-don't-like-me vibe. It's not personal, You represent everything I'm against. What's that? Pushing meaningless chain store junk Instead of promoting independent artists And local businesses? I sell affordable. You don't know me. I knew you the second you slapped your ad on Christmas. It's business. -Gift-giving is more than that. -I agree. It's gonna be a hot day in December Before you and I agree, Paul Dennis. Well, good thing it's cold. Would you like a t-shirt? Actually, you know what? I'll take a t-shirt. Mm! -Merry Christmas! -Happy holidays. See ya. I know we all work remotely Other than these holistic team-building exercises, But I like to think of Giftverse as a family. So know that I am here 24/7, Even if you just need an ear to talk to. I'm here both as your leader and spiritual ally. -Thank you, Miranda. -You're welcome. Sheryl, hi! hi! Sorry I'm late. I just got off the phone with the other investors. Boutique thrive has made an offer to acquire us. You're not actually seriously thinking of selling to them? No, no, no. We're making progress! Yes! The app no longer suggests "grandma, I get you lingerie." No, but people are using the app, Sheryl. People are deleting the app Once they see that the gift recommendations are off. It's been months since launch And the accuracy has barely improved. Okay, but we're so close. Please. You know me. I need the algorithms To understand people a little better. Listen, it's not personal, it's business. I brought these over from the house for you. Oh, cute! - agh! - what's wrong, dad? I can't get my holiday kombucha anywhere else now But that soulless e-commerce juggernaut boutique thrive. They're not so bad. I mean, they're committing to sustainable energy And shipping, so... Any dates? No one? Nothing? Well, I actually met someone the other day. You did? What does he look like? Uh, he's tall with a beard, likes red, always wears a hat. Maybe he's balding. Mm, I don't think so, But his hair is completely white. How old is this gentleman? Oh, elderly, in a timeless way. Listen, Mira, we always said That you could fall in love With whomever you like but... It was a Santa crawl, dad. Very funny, ha ha! Maybe a Santa crawl isn't the best place to meet someone. There's more to life than work. Yeah, so... My app was acquired by boutique thrive. It wasn't my choice. Well, what... What does this mean for you? I work for a soulless juggernaut now, I guess... Or I could quit. Hey, McCauleys don't quit! All I wanted was to recreate the same care and insight That the local shopkeeper would have like you guys did. You know, promote the same artists that we worked with. But now boutique thrive just swooped in. Well, 'cause it's a great idea, that's what they do. They stomp on acquisitions like a mindless child. Times change and our shop wasn't going to last. Hey, maybe... Maybe you could, uh... Push for change on the inside. You know, like a Trojan horse with good intentions. - Yeah, we could help, too! - yeah! we could protest anything. -Yeah, um... -Your mom and I, we could... We could chain ourselves to whatever you want! like those trees! Okay, yeah. So I'm just going to see how it goes first And then I'll give you guys a call... If I need you. - Okay? - okay. all right. Rum and eggnog. Okay, let's get the party started! -Woo! -Yeah! Thank you so much. Ah. What are you doing here? Apparently you know as much as I do. Good morning. Hi. What are you doing here? Good to see you too, Miranda. Grant Boyd. Boutique thrive hired me to oversee the process. -Hey, how are you? -Hi. - hey. - I'm really good. Do you guys... Know each other? Yeah, well, we... Well, we used to... A long time ago, but it was... Yeah, we worked at a start-up together. Ah, right. Hey, sorry... What process? Well, as you know, your two companies Have been acquired by boutique thrive. But what you do not know is that they have now merged. That makes no sense. Why would boutique thrive want two apps? They want to corner All the gift recommendation apps on the market. But that's combining apples with oranges. -Mainstream and a bargain bin. -Water and a gas fire. Charm and you. Okay, uh... You know what? You two are going to be working together as partners. that's a good one. Yeah. Improve the gift recommendation accuracy So that we can release an update To target last-minute shoppers. We're fine, we don't need to... Yeah, my app works fine. No, no, your apps don't work. Otherwise, I would not be standing here in front of you. Boutique thrive wants an increase by 20% in buys For last-minute shoppers And you two are going to help us reach that target. So can you double The gift recommendation accuracy in five days? -Uh... -Phew... Okay, well, that is why we are here, team. You two work together, use your expertise and your data. Which data platform are we using? Uh, both, for now. Do that and you'll retain your positions. Oh, and we're gonna be unveiling both versions At boutique thrive's Christmas party on the 23rd. -Uh, okay. -Any questions? -Yeah, yeah... -okay, great! I'm pumped. You pumped? Go get 'em! All right. See you. So, where did that adorable name come from, present ninja? Oh... Wow, you're the gift that keeps on giving, Aren't you? I'm a giver. What can I say? So, you ready to collaborate... Partner? Gonna be so much fun. it's a lack of data problem. It's not just about shoppers' trends ... It's understanding people. Trust me, okay? I have five start-ups under my belt, Three e-commerce sites And an entrepreneur of the year award. Wow. So where's the trophy? that's not what I'm saying. Hmm. Do you bring it with you everywhere, show your mom? I'm simply saying That I have recognized experience in this field. Okay. Well, I actually grew up in my family's shop. So knowing customers and suggesting the perfect gift Is in my blood. Okay, so you're going to personally figure out Each gift recommendation? mm hm. Oh, wow! It's... Beautiful. And the entrepreneur of the year goes to... Paul! Yeah! Woo! That's exactly how it went down. Yeah. I'm sure. I'm sure it did. Also know his merger isn't my idea. Well, we both have that in common. -Where's the data reports? -Right there. Hey. Oh, have we met before? I don't think so. -I'm Miranda. -Jackie. Product manager here. Wiser sister. Hmm. Hmm. Okay, you said before that finding the perfect gift Wasn't just about business to you. So what did you mean by that? Everyone in tech talks about disrupting, But what about mending? Hmm. Elevating the quality of how people Give and receive gifts. That would bring the world closer, Certainly the people I love closer. So what now? Do we start sharing? Oh, do you... Do you want a t-shirt? Huh? It's blue. It's definitely your color. This is going to be a long December. -Yeah! -Yeah. -Here! -Thank you. Oh, so they hired grant as a consultant To oversee the merger. Grant. Uh huh. Do they know that you two...? Okay, but you're over him So just make sure you look fabulous, okay, And leave this guy in your dust! Yeah. -You are over him, right? -Yep. Miranda, no! It was just easier when he wasn't around, you know? I thought he was the one, Erika. It's not just something you toss away! We were perfect... Until we were a complete disaster. Thank you! Thank you. You haven't been able to trust another guy since. What about Mr. Claus from the crawl? oh, it was magical. We talked about Christmas, destiny... Female mustaches... so how did you not see his face... Or get his name? We were being so cute Keeping the Mr. And Mrs. Claus thing going, you know? Hold on. Hold this. Uh huh, continue. I've just never felt a connection so quickly before. It was perfect, like everything was supposed to happen. Did you check the crawl's social media page? Hm? Okay! Okay, okay, okay. "looking for Mrs. Claus. We met on the crawl. "talked destiny and danced. I have your glove!" Do you think it's him? I don't think it's a ransom note for a glove, Miranda. What's his profile pic? Okay. Oh, it's empty! -Fake. -What does that mean? It means he has something to hide. Okay, well, maybe he's just being cautious. Or maybe he's a criminal. But you should totally respond. You literally just called him a criminal. Yeah, but what if he's a really hot, charming criminal? Make a fake profile, too, if you're worried. But this is a fun mystery. You know, I didn't know I needed this in my life. Thank you so much. I'm glad that my life is entertaining you. Really wonderful. "Mr. Claus, thanks for finding my glove. "sorry I left. Had to... Unexpectedly dash to the north pole for a friend. "I had a magical evening..." That was too desperate. "I had a good time... "fun time." Don't overthink this, Miranda. so why the fake profile? Don't know yet if you're on Santa's nice list. How do I know you're not really some 70-year-old man? 'cause I'm the angel that fell from the tree. All right, buddy. Play it safe. "why ruin the mystery just yet?" so now what? Let's pretend that that night never ended. so what do you do for work, Santa? What do you think I do? I imagine a clean-shaven predator In a glass jungle fantasizing of conquering the world With an empty in-box. Suppose so. I work in tech like half the people in this city. I imagine you're the type of person Who organizes their books by color and cries during movies. I actually cry during savvy commercials, too. Also work in tech. This is a very important question. Is it cheating if you watch a tv show Without your significant other? Definitely. Mm hm... If there was an Olympic sport everyday activity, What would you win? Misplacing things. I have a label maker. Nerd. What about you? Accidentally killing indoor plants. Well, I can help. I've got lots of plants. Plant dork? Another important question: Is a hotdog a sandwich? No. glad you have principles. you have no principles. look, I had a single mother and she could not afford Extravagant Christmas gifts, so I want the gift recommendations To be in reach of single mothers like mine. Accountability is my principle, which you get At scalability with chain stores. Okay, but affordable junk is still junk! We can do better And support local businesses at the same time! Wait, why are we here? I need a tree. So you double-booked our meeting. I'm busy. This is the only free time that I had. -You're incredible. -Thank you! -Dad! -Hey! Thanks for dropping him off. Hey, buddy. Hey, this is Miranda. She works with your dad. Miranda, this is my son Ryan. -Hello, sir. -Hi. You can call me Ryan. Oh! Hi, Ryan. I bet these trees aren't even sustainably grown. But we're gonna find a perfect tree, aren't we? Yes, we are! You know what? I'm going to find you the perfect gift. Come with me. Let's see... Ooh! -What about this guy? -Perfect! -Thank you, Miranda. -You're very welcome. Dad, I want to pick a tree! Yeah, go check. We need boots on the ground to figure out why The algorithms are off. What does that even mean? What about this one? Whoa! Well, it's a little crooked, bud. Yeah. Okay, listen. I found the perfect candidate. Veronica s. Prolific, online reviewer, shops local. We understand her gift-buying habits for her family, We understand half of our demographic. Okay, so what? We follow her like a safari. You're finally catching on, entrepreneur of the year. This makes no sense. Okay, well, it's time that we try something different. What about this one? Wow! Yeah, it's a good shape. This could be a winner! Yeah. Color's off, not fresh. Okay. You want me to help you pick a tree? Yeah. Okay, choose any one here, Show me which one you like. This one. Good choice. Let's check the trunk, See if it's sticky. No, Ryan, don't... Ew! That means it's fresh! Okay, now let's check the needles. They shouldn't snap. Hold the branch. See how it doesn't come off? -Fresh! -You got it. You're a tree-picking expert now! Thank you! Thank you. Veronica. Indulge me. Okay. Got the tree, let's go. Come on, Ry. Uh, I'll just... Don't worry about me. I got it. Yeah. -Hey. -Hi! Oh... I just wanted to apologize For the professional distance. I didn't want to show any favoritism. - Wouldn't want to do that. - Uh uh. How's everything? Good! Great, yeah. You look really, really happy. You're glowing. Thank you. So how are you? What's going on? Oh, you know, saving the world one start-up at a time. No, no. In all seriousness, I am phenomenal. I love consulting, coming in, helping businesses With their acquisition transitions. Uh huh. Look, I wanted to apologize For the way things ended between us. You know, I really hope things won't be weird! Oh, no. That's like years ago. I'm so over it, yeah. great! Whew! Yeah! Okay. Hello. Thank you, Mr. Claus! I wanted to set aside some time for update meetings. Is this for me? Yes, for you... Update meetings on the progress. Just you and I. What do you think? -I... -no, no, no. I'm doing the same thing with Paul. Also, uh... Truffle or pumpkin spice? Look you don't have to do all this. You know, you deserve better, Plus they're from your favorite spot. You know my weakness. Oh! And they're also a work expense write-off. So, how's working with Paul? Um... We're going on a safari. Yeah. I'm excited. It's gonna be fun. Mm. Okay. So, Veronica, how do you get inspired For your Christmas day shopping? Okay, listen, are you guys okay? You just seem tense. Like you don't like each other. What?! I'm sorry. I just don't want you Ruining my Christmas shopping vibe. -No, we're cool. -Yeah. I so look forward to hanging with Miranda. Yeah, we're blessed. So fun! Fine. Prove it. hm? Excuse me, excuse me.

I really hope you know what you're doing Because we have three days. Veronica, wait up! Veronica! - these are all yours? - yes! How do you pick Christmas presents for your family? Well, I walk as if I'm in the receiver's shoes. Like my cousins are into fashion So I check which influencer's they're following. Knowing that, I see what speaks to me here. Got it. Also makes me feel closer to them. Okay, my aunt loves sweets so we'll hit up a chocolatier And my uncle's into vintage books and I know this guy who... What... Is that? -What did we learn so far? -A lot, actually. Really? Well, if you were observing Instead of grinching Maybe you would have noticed. is that a smile I see? -Ooh... -What are you doing? Looking for the fun. You're worse than Jackie. Fine. You want a full Christmas spirit? Uh hm. Let's go. The wild life's getting away. Oh! Wow! One, two, three... Why are you so far apart? Closer. Okay. Ah! It's so cute. Aww. -Hey! -Hi! So I'm double-booked for a snowball fight meetup but I will try and catch up for curling later? - mm hm. - Sounds good. Let's see this on you. Okay. Hey, you look... -Never mind! -Yeah. - curling? - yeah. Hey, listen, this has been a lot of fun, But what are we doing here? Veronica confirmed what I thought. Which is...? Okay, let me ask you a question. What was the best Christmas gift You've ever received? -A basketball. -Why? Because I knew money was tight and I wanted something That Jackie and I could both play with. -Okay, it brought you closer together. -Yeah. Mine was hockey skates. I wanted to be a figure skater Like Kristi Yamaguchi. But playing hockey with my dad was everything. It brought us closer. And I'm thankful for that. The basketball is your story, not demographics. To fix the apps We need to understand our customer story better, Their values. We need to really see them Just like how Veronica steps into her loved ones' shoes To be inspired. So it's a data problem, Like I said days ago. No, you're not listening to me. It's how we interpret the data. It's an intimacy problem but with our users. Okay, so I'll just book some therapy sessions For our apps then. Listen, I should be at the office Instead of indulging in this field trip. -I'm trying to save our apps. -So am I! Oh! -Great, come here! -You're really something tonight! Come here. all right? Ow! Leave me alone, you Grinch! So, how's working together? Productive! Paul? We... We actually learned a lot from Veronica so... sorry, did we? What are you talking about? I'm really wasting my valuable time Listening to her pontificate About hippy-dippy feelings Instead of getting it done. -Okay... -hippy-dippy? Well, if the app doesn't work right In the next two days boutique thrive will shut you down And re-appropriate your intellectual property. So get it done or go home for Christmas with nothing. Okay! Okay! That went well. I thought so. How's the merger going? Oh, the app is still off. Then listen better. We taught that at the shop. Mom, it's getting the app to understand users' values Through photos and posts. No, it's about letting them do the talking, Miranda. Listen. Well, the app needs to intuitively ask without asking. Ah! You're the psychology major. Oh, and I also have to work with this arrogant CEO, Paul Dennis. Comes with the territory. What?! I'm a CEO, dad. But you're kind of a new-age CEO. -Is he... Single? -Mum. Just curious. Love is love. Is he... Handsome? Never give in to the establishment. -Taking it to 'em, dad. -That's my girl. How did you find out about this place? This pudding! A friend recommended it. -I'm hungry... -Uh uh. Mm... Come on. "dear Mr. Claus, thank you for the tip. "my parents loved the pudding. "your homework now is to send me your favorite movie list. "I'll send mine. "I'm having trouble at work. "wondering if you have any advice "a difficult co-worker won't compromise. "what should I do?" "dear Mrs. Claus, "managing people is, in fact, my specialty. "get to know this person Bette, find out what they're after. "see where you both align and convince them "of what you'll bring to the table. "I'm sure they'll soften." Hey! What's going on. Where's Ryan? I got a babysitter. So we can concentrate. That's too bad. I actually like spending time with Ryan More than you. do you want to grab food? Absolutely. I do need your help on something else. Okay, so you have no inkling on what gift to get them? Just recently met. All right, well, what do you love about this person? She's a firecracker. She'd run circles around you. What makes her happy? She's a dreamer. Thank you. A romantic. An idealist. Hmm. Mm, she likes gardening. Should I get her a shovel? What's her style? I... I don't know. I respect her privacy. That's okay. I don't need to know. It's... It's a little more complicated than that. See, if you offered me more details I could probably Recommend an actual item. But from the way you smile about her I think you need to get her a romantically clever gift. You're right. Anyone else you need to get gifts for? Relatives, anyone? See, you just need to turn me into the algorithm Then we're gonna be fine. How big are you? 'cause could you fit into this phone? ♪ we wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ we wish you a merry Christmas ♪ You know, I think Santa is calling us. Should we? Hmm. ♪ and a happy new year ♪ ♪ ...Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ we wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ we wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ and a happy new year ♪ ♪ we wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ we wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ we wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ and a happy new year ♪ so why'd you start Giftverse? Well, my parents ran a shop for years ... Stationery, gifts, art supplies, all locally made Until chain stores put them out of business. I'm sorry. Yeah. He's really good. I know that era's over, but why can't my app Connect people to those same artists Just like my parents did? You know, if small sellers united They'd be bigger than chain stores And drive down costs too. Passion doesn't come from an assembly line. And it's not just knowing what customers want, It's knowing how to find those unique suggestions. You know, quality and cheap shouldn't be mutually exclusive. That's all, just saying. I'm just trying to be the equalizer. What about you, though? How did you come up with that name, present ninja? Ryan. Him sneaking around like a ninja Trying to find his Christmas presents. Oh, I feel so bad. I'm so sorry that I said that. Yeah! You should feel terrible, judging before you know. so where's his mom? Yeah, she, uh... Lives across the country. I got custody. We got married when we were too young. A couple of years ago She got him a hockey stick for Christmas And he doesn't even play hockey. And he was really confused Why she would get him a gift like that. So after that I thought I should create an app That would improve gift giving. You know, elevate the quality of gifts, You know, to match the level of love we feel for each other. I think everyone could use that. That's really sweet. Hey, you should look at our algorithm parameters. Maybe you could give your gift insight to help rematch them. You have access to our data. Sounds good. Thank you. No problem. Hey, do you recognize that one? frosty? Yes. Okay, that's who I thought it was. It looked familiar, right? It's frosty. Frosty the snowman. Oh. - sorry. - What's going on? Oh, nothing. You wanna get out of here? And go where? We can walk and work. grant! Come on. You're always go, go, go. So, let's go. I'll grant you some grant time. You're still using that line, hm? It worked on you, didn't it? Yeah, unfortunately it did. So, I need your help buying a gift. Oh! For who? For my girlfriend, Kelly. Hm. Can you do your gift genius thing? Yeah! What do you love about her? Her energy! I mean, we feed off of each other. She's a personal trainer. Hm. Why are you giving me that look? I'm not giving you a look. Uh... No look here. No? I don't know. I mean, she's not into tech or fine dining, But, you know, she's trying. There's not a lot of three-star vegan restaurants. But we do a lot of outdoor stuff, skiing. She calms me, she laughs at my jokes. Well, what does she love about you? All of me. Yeah, nothing in there. So what is it that makes her happy? Challenging herself. hm. And what's your favorite memory of her? Uh... Snowed in at the chalet on new years'. You took her to the chalet? No I'm... The day she said, "I'm yours." -Grant, I don't... -You know? Forget it.

So we're really gonna go meet Mr. Claus? Yes! Come on, Miranda, this is so exciting! This is like a game show prize reveal. Behind door number one is Mr. Claus! Or... Like in a movie where a spy just rips off his mask. What if he doesn't live up to my expectations. -What if he does? -What if I don't? Look, we have a lot of fun just chatting. You don't need a pen pal. That's true... And he has my glove. Okay, so we're really going to do this. We're gonna go meet him. Okay, so if she's... She's crazy or weird, I need you to intervene.

Okay... Itchy? Uh uh. So after the app works, then what? -Oohh! -Yes! -Sorry. -What do you mean? What, you don't have like side hobbies or a passion? Giftverse is my passion. What's yours? -I want to find a house. -Then buy one. Nah, it's... Like the challenge of a start-up is addictive. But most of those businesses, They don't do anything meaningful. And I get bored and I jump ship. I wanna find something that... That lasts. I want to create non-profit apps. Like what? Like an app that connects woman programmers To female mentors. Or even an app that shows you Where the best Christmas lights are in the neighborhood. You know, Ryan... Ryan would love that. Have you started any? Oh! Honestly, I haven't had the time. Ahh, just do it! Like that... See that? That. I jump ship all the time, you just gotta jump. I'll help you. See where you wanna throw? -I got this. -Visualize it. I haven't got one in yet. Feel it? Mm hm. Fire. Woo! Got it! I wasn't expecting that. Come on, We're gonna go look at the Christmas lights. Wanna go... See the lights? Your head still itchy or you good to go? Really? You're gonna bring that up again? Unbelievable. Unbelievable! too funny. so what do you want for Christmas? Just for Ryan to be happy. Oh! Her! -I dare you! -No, I dare you! one, two, three... Gotcha! Okay, well, I better go. We've got that presentation tomorrow so... -Yeah, yeah. -We gotta get to it, right? Erika? We gotta go. -What? -Come on. Oh, okay. Uh, I'll call you. -Okay. -Okay, bye! - Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. - bye! all right! Come on, Jackie. Jackie and Camilla have finished Merging your data with ours. Great. I think it's pinpointing A person's style and hobbies much better. Thanks to you. Whoa. Okay, I'm gonna write that one down. That was what... Sorry, December 19th. Miranda actually thanks me? Stop. I'll just stick that right there. I'm just gonna stick that right there. Why isn't this working? Let me see. There's one last trick that I know. Just gotta... No! Don't do that! Just needed a little manly touch. Caveman touch. Well, I think grant will be pleased with the progress. You guys have a thing...? Had a thing? Oh, I'm sure he'll be impartial. Um? I have a system! Uh huh. What's that, utter chaos? This looks... A little wasteful. I thought you were a tree-hugger. I recycle. Mm... Okay. I'm helping you. -You've got to live a little, Paul. -No, no. Here, have a cookie. Oh, thanks. Ah! Thank you. How good are they? These are horrible. Just horrible. Okay. I gotta head back to the office. What are you drawing there? We're picking a Christmas tree in the forest. I'm an expert. oh, yeah? Does your dad wear a suit To the forest? He always wears a suit. Hmm, maybe he works too much. You were leaving? Yes, um... So, you know, if the presentation goes well They're gonna have to name Someone in charge eventually. Yeah. I've been coordinating With boutique thrive's tech department And they've been hinting for us To nudge the gift recommendations Towards their merchant partners. Favor their products? In an un-biased, uh, very biased way, yes. So they're seeing if we're team players over Miranda? I like her. She's cool, little man. Go and do it. Yes. bam, bam, bam! Slam, slam, slam! Boom! What, it's my thing? See ya later. -Bye! -Bye. Don't start this. Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no! Okay, okay! Surrender, surrender. I have to go to work. You have to go to the babysitter. Come on, come on. Come on, oh! Sheryl, I know you care about vegan leather, Ethical treatment of animals... Yes! What does it say? Oh! That accuracy rate is not acceptable. We've seen enough. Grant, wait. Just give us some more time. I've been working on Giftverse for years. Just to be shut down over one test? You guys didn't double the accuracy. This debacle could hurt sales more than help them. Give us the weekend. Please. Sheryl, you owe me. Let's give hem the weekend. Monday morning... But build off of present ninja's version. What? Why? It uses the data better. Pillage whatever you need from Giftverse. You're in charge. Miranda, I'm sorry. -We'll talk. -Yeah. Let's talk! What's the plan? I'm shut down. This is our app, together. You don't need me. Boutique thrive doesn't care About the right gift, just percentages and sales. I care! Look, I'm naive to think that I could change anything From the inside. I'm just going to be A part of the problem. We determine the app, not them. A working app is too valuable for them to tinker with. We'll promote the artists and sellers you want, Alongside affordable, mixed in. Mixed in? Calm your righteousness, okay? This is a victory. Why would you do that? You know, I would hate to see the world Miss out on another pair of ice skates. I'm doing this for Ryan. I need to do this right. I need you. Can I trust you? That we're not just going to be helping the same type of Business practices that shut down my family's shop? I know how much this app means to you. Okay, let's, uh... Let's go do something fun. Yeah. I have an idea. Yes! Perfect. Cool! Up you go! Yay! Woo! This was a really good idea. Okay, one final little touch. -Nice! -Yay! Dad, I wanna play. Yeah, go play, go play! So what's your favorite Christmas tradition? When my brother and I were little, my parents used to hide Our Christmas gifts. But like really, really hide our Christmas gifts. One year my present was in the back of the freezer. My mom and uncle did the same thing. Really? Yeah, they made it special Even though we didn't have a lot. Aww... Looks amazing. Keep going. Jackie was super competitive. They would hide scrap pieces of paper With little riddles as clues. We got a gift treasure map. How far did they make you go? Up a tree. a park, a mile away. No joke. Okay, more hair? Hair! One little final touch. He looks like shocked! Oh, it's a he? Yeah. Are you just gonna leave your scarf? Oh, he seems cold. He... Is a snowman. Well, I knitted it so I could just make another one. May be we tilt gift recommendations Towards family activities. -Home. -Home. Maybe we need to go back to my roots. Yeah. How good are you with defending yourself From people with strong opinions, hm? I can charm anyone. Yeah, we'll see. Look what I made! Okay, Ry, woo! Ry! Ryan, yes. Weee! You're fun, Miranda. Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay! Hey, buddy! Hey, hey, hey. Miranda's family might be a little strange, So just be polite, okay? I'm always polite, dad. Are you polite? Yes, you are. Okay, come on. - hello? - hello? well... Hello there! You must be the oppressor. -Hi. -Hello, how are you? Good, how are you? I'm very well, thank you. Well, hello! Hello! Paul Dennis. Miranda's told me all about you guys And your shop. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Judy, this is Michael, come in. We're so glad to have you. Come on in, guys. We've got lots of food. I hope you're hungry. Miranda! Hi! This is for you. What is this? I didn't use the app, If that's what you're asking. It's an organizer! You're not supposed to tell. Sorry. It's a padfolio for your bag. Thank you. It's very sweet. Trying to buy her off? Park the crusade, Michael. So, Paul, how many people have you laid off today? okay, why don't we eat? -Good idea. -Yeah. Yeah, I'm starving. yum, yum, yum. this looks good. uh huh! Dig in. wow! This looks really amazing. well, Christmas dinner is our specialty And we expect it all to be eaten. Oh! good. So, you guys, you do this every week? Uh huh. It's like a chef's challenge. We pick produce from the local farmer's market And then we have to come up with dishes. And I eat. You poor thing, how do you cope? Well, they get to eat whatever and look great And then I have to bike it off the next day. I bike too! No way! That's so cool, where do you go? My mainstay is the loop Down by the marina. I used to do that. You bike? Yeah, yeah. You been up to Baldwin hill? Of course! They finally repaved it so the asphalt's grippy. -No way. -Yeah. Well, you're not what I expected. Neither are you. So, um... Gift-giving? Yes, as you know, It's all about knowing the recipient, Their story. Well, the relationship with the giver. I mean, you guys are basically matchmakers. You're essentially doing a dating app, in a way. You guys are doing a dating app. Yeah, gift giving is love. It's giving a love of someone, of a hobby, of a memory... Lots of lovin', dad. We get it. You have to pay attention. People want to feel heard. Feel seen by the gifts they receive. Well, sure. We used to ask people questions When they came in the shop And we got to know them. Won't be fully automated. Maybe you can't automate What has to come from the heart. Like a questionnaire, the answers are the story. Mm hm. For example, what do you love about the person Or what do they love about you? Yeah. Favorite memory of them. Listen to your heart speak. Instead of sizing someone up. Hm. So who wants s'mores for dessert? Yes! - Ryan and I got this. - Oh ho! High five! Let's go. Okay. Oh, I'm stuffed. So, Judy, what would you like for Christmas? Oh, I don't need anything. Ahh, okay. You're that family member who nobody knows what to get. What if you had to choose a gift? Well, I have everything I need... But I guess it would have be something that fed that need. Something that brought you together more? Uh huh. They're having so much fun over there. I'm missing all the fun with Ryan. -Go, go, go. -Okay. My parents love doting over Ryan. Yeah, well, do not let him trick you. He is demanding. Okay, I'll be on guard. This is perfect. Yeah, it is. Do you have a charger? Yeah, in my office. Just over there. I got you! And you too! Hey, I'm gonna join the festivities! Let's go! oh! oh! I'm so sorry! Who's team are you on? We traditions here. We have our marshmallow fight before s'mores And Ryan here seems deadly. -You're on our team. -Yes! -Let's go! -Wha...? He's the family! Hey! You're my son! Yeah! - um... - um... Ah, that was fun. Thank you. What do you say? Thank you. Aw, it was my pleasure. So we'll implement those questions into the app? Yeah, the five ... What do you love about this person? What do they love about you? Favorite memory of them? Uh, what makes them happy? And their style. Exactly. Merry Christmas. Will you come back and visit us? Oh, yeah. - Merry Christmas. - merry Christmas. You too? bye, Ry. Bye. See ya! Well, he's not the worst. It was a great night. "dear ms. Claus, "I don't know why you didn't show up that night. "hoping you weren't just a fairy tale. "hope to hear from you." He was there. What's grant doing here? Hey. Hey. Sorry to drop in like this. Oh, okay. We're sitting. Yes. I wanted to apologize. I had to put Paul in charge. Yeah, I understand. No. Boutique thrive wanted me to Push the present ninja platform, too. It was already decided. Why? Paul is a... Team player. Oh. But if you can get the app to work That's a big cash-out. Grant, I'm not doing this for the money. You could start another app with that payout. Or you could join me. Really, work for you? Yeah, come work for me. It'll be fun. You've got to start thinking about your next gig. -Engine slows for no one. -Hmm... It's an open offer. I thought the engine slows for no one. For you I'd wait. That doesn't sound like you. Look, uh, I want you back. You have a girlfriend. I want you. I made the biggest mistake of my life messing things up with you. Well, what about Kelly? You and I, we really suit each other. You know that. Yeah, I don't know How I'm supposed to feel about this right now. You don't have to say anything. Just know that I am here for you. Yeah. Well... You know what I think? I think that... You should go home to your girlfriend. Okay. So... We can forget this ever happened. Okay. I'll see you Monday? -Yeah. -Good luck! -Okay. -Yeah. Hello? I've got to talk to you. I messaged Mrs. Claus again. What, why? Well, there has to be a good reason why she disappeared. What about Miranda? What about? Um... You seem to really enjoy spending time together? We're working. Oh, yeah, you're just working. Okay. I can't have her getting attached to Ryan. And if I never meet Mrs. Claus again I'll never know. She didn't show up. Miranda has. But... Hey, she's too good for you. Listen, I don't think we're gonna get this new app build Done in time With all these new questions added. It's a complete overhaul, okay, in two days. How do we solve this? Well, we could full-on push boutique thrive's products. They've hinted that the accuracy won't matter then. And plus it buys us a little more time Until after the holidays. But I know that you promised Miranda. So I don't think we should... Do it. Just for now. Alright, we'll change it back later. I'm not going to waste two years over sentimentality. Okay. Thanks, jacks. So grant wants me back. Hmm. I thought he had a vegan girlfriend. Maybe he finally wants to settle down. Maybe he's changed. Oh! That sounds really bad out loud. Really bad. Okay. Well, have we heard back from Mr. Claus? Yeah, he messaged me saying he was there that night. There was no guy with a glove. I checked everywhere, Miranda. Okay, well, maybe he's lying too. Maybe he's a hot criminal like you said. I don't know. I just actually don't know anything anymore. What about Paul? Are we just going down a list of names? No! He seems cool! And you guys had a lot of fun that night And why have you been acting so cheery lately? You're just saying this because now you're dating Jackie And you want to do a double-date wine tasting. -No! -Oh, yeah. Okay, maybe once in a while. I don't trust him. You haven't trusted any guy since grant, Miranda. I think it's time to take a leap of faith, you know? Maybe you're right... Again. Okay, you got the chocolates? -Uh huh. -Let's go. You guys actually did it! Woo! -86% accuracy. -Woo! Well, Miranda did it. Their team did all the legwork. Uh, yeah we did. Bam, bam, bam! Slam, slam, slam! Jacks, no. You're awesome. Ah, I love this energy. I will let boutique thrive know the great news. Get this live immediately And I will see you all at the Christmas party. Alright? Huh? Ah, we'll party. For you, mom and dad. - hey! - Hi! We did it. Yeah, we did. Paul, where'd you go? Come on. See you tonight? Uh huh. Storm's coming in. It'll be cold. It's a short walk. Hang tight. "dear Mr. Claus, I was at the bar that night. "I waited for you. Where were you?" Hey. That's better. Thank you. I'll see you tonight. Yeah. -Yeah. -Yes. okay. Okay. -Bye. -Good... Miranda! ah! Larry Sosa. Boutique thrive CEO. Wow, it's so nice to finally meet you, sir. Now do you have, um... A moment? Yes, of course. Paul said that you solved the algorithm issue. An expertise from our background. You know, Paul changed the algorithm to push our product So he would get into my good graces. He did what? But he didn't have to because you figured it out. I need people who know what they're doing To take this app into the future. Not a 'yes' man. I want you to be in charge of the app going forward. What about favoring your products? Oh come on, come on, come on, come on! Gotta be a team player, too. Shouldn't we be pushing the best gift possible? We have the opportunity here To promote independent businesses and artists. Boutique thrive is still gonna get a cut from the app. I know this is personal to you. Can I keep the app unbiased, Larry? No. Think it over and, um... We'll talk. Miranda? Kelly! Grant's girlfriend. Hi. Listen, I want to thank you. Oh. Thank me? I was freaking out When I heard grant was working with you. But he's suddenly been opening up, Showing me this sensitive, caring side. He's been a changed man the last two weeks. Has he? I don't know what you said to him, But thank you. Well, I... Nothing. I guess grant realized How much he's truly yours. I'm really happy for you guys. hey, what are you two chatting about? Just how silly you are. I'm funny? he's so funny! I'm going to get vegan eggnog. You guys want anything? I'm fine, thank you. You owe me like a bajillion cupcakes. -Miranda! -Don't worry about it. I made a mistake. Seeing you again, All these emotions came rushing back. Me too. But then I realized That they're just memories. Like a photo album That just keeps all the good stuff. Well, I'm sorry, again. She's head over heels for you. I know. Be worthy of that. I will. -Okay, good. -Okay, Merry Christmas, grant. Merry Christmas, Miranda. You look stunning! You promised me. You said you wouldn't push boutique thrive's products Over the right gift. I was making sure that we didn't get shut down. You used me. We can change it back. That's not the point. Here I am helping the same profiteers That shut down my family's shop. it's business. Get off your high horse. You're ruthless. I am not some corrupt person that you have in your mind. No, you're worse. You've tainted my dream And now I've let my family down Because of you. Listen to me, okay? It was just the backup plan, And we will change it back. Not according to Larry. You need to start trusting your feelings and not your doubts. You're right. I should have trusted my instincts. You've lived up to my expectations, Paul. So have you. Oh, they offered me your position. Well, you deserve it. I'm quitting anyways. I don't want it. I'm not willing to betray everything I stand for. Then make it what you stand for. Your jacket's in coat check. You know, you can step down And act all high and mighty about this Or you can fight for it. Like I said, it's business. Merry Christmas, Miranda. I accept. Well, I'm happy to hear that. Let me introduce you. Welcome, everyone, to boutique thrive's annual holiday party! We have much to celebrate and be thankful for.

Romantically clever. I realized that it's best to listen to the heart. Can I make snow angels, dad? Yeah, sure, bud. Hey, look, I'm sorry that I changed the app Without asking you. You were right. I should have stepped up Instead of stepping out. And my publicity stunt forced their hand. I got full control, at least for awhile. Well, it's enough time to prove to them your ideas.
