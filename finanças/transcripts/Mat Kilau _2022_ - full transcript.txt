THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS, MAT KILAU BIN IMAM RASU, 1866-1970 THIS STORY IS INSPIRED BY THE CHARACTER AND HEROIC EVENTS OF MAT KILAU THE CHARACTERS AND EVENTS IN THE FILM ARE FICTIONAL ANY SIMILARITY TO PERSONS LIVING OR DEAD IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL KUALA TEMBELING, PAHANG, 1890 Please have a drink. Thank you. Who's that, Mother? Dear. All of you. Come out now! Move! Come out now! Don't resist! Don't come out, Salmah. Hey, what do you all want? Allah, Dear! -Allah. -Dear! Move! Come on! Move! Faster! Move! Come on! God! -Quick! Quick! -Let go! Why do people here like to give the British a hard time? You dare to defy the British. Are you all not afraid of our power? Be like a buffalo. The buffalo can live because it obeys its master. It's the same for you people. You need to obey us. This Malay land has its master and officers that look after it. But there are three buffaloes here that dare to fight the British officer, Mr. Deaborough. Rebels, you have no idea what kind of punishment you'll get. The names I'm going to mention must step forward now. Mamat. Lazim. Seman. Where are you? Where are they? Stop! We don't know! The people you're looking for aren't here! Dear. Don't be rude and create chaos on our land! We just want to make a living peacefully. You'd better leave. I said leave… Dear! Allah! Who else dares to defy us? Now, spit it out. Where are Mamat, Lazim, and Seman? We… We surrender. Just arrest us. We confess that we were the ones who went against the British officer. Move, come on! -Move! -Move! -Down! -Down! There is no such thing as Malay people rebelling on their own land. We are defending our rights. You… You come to our land to loot our natural resources. We will take all the resources of this Malay land. There is nothing you can do to stop us. Do you want to fight the British? Let me see what the Malays can do to the British government. We didn't do anything wrong! We just want our land back. That's all! This is a lesson for the Malays so they'll know the consequences if they oppose us. Infidels who are cursed by Allah! For the sake of Allah! For the sake of the Messenger of Allah! I stand on this land of Pahang! Under the heavens of Allah who I uphold! You, you, and you will witness the rise of the Malays and our retaliation against the cruelty of White colonialism. Allah! What more do you want, devil? I've surrendered! Animals! Allah is the Greatest! Father! Kill them! CAPTAIN HC SYERS CAPTAIN HC SYERS PULAU TAWAR, PAHANG What we're worried about has started to happen. Letting the invaders run rampant is like allowing the enemy to perforate the walls of our houses one by one until our identity, customs, and religion are all removed. So rising up and uniting to defend our homeland becomes obligatory to us who claim to be believers. What you have shown just now proves you are ready. Your regulation of breathing and energy must always be parallel and in tandem. Remembrance of Allah is the fuel of our fight. Preferably, we should always be ahead of time. "By time, indeed, mankind is in loss," Allah said. For the sake of time. All right, Father. We cannot change the time indeed. But we will try to use it to gain blessing with prayer and knowledge. We will overcome all our weaknesses. Glory be to Allah with the greatness of His creation. Whoever is more prepared, he is the one who will have the advantage. The weak and those who like to procrastinate are the ones who will be defeated. We already have enough time and strength. Stay away from harmful things, Awang. Don't be overconfident. Actually, we can only plan. Have you forgotten that time is also Allah's creature? Being silent does not mean we lose, Awang. Kilau is right. The blessings of time and knowledge are the most important. Patience. That's the key. That's the characteristic of a warrior. Remember, guard your religion. Guard your nation. TEMERLOH, PAHANG DATO BAHAMAN HULU SEMANTAN, PAHANG What's wrong, Haji Sulong? Bad news? The British have already begun to show their true colors. The Malay land is in danger. KUALA TEMBELING GOLD MINE PROFESSOR CAMERON Hurry up! Move! Get up! Come on! Don't think that I don't know who you are. No, Mamat! No! British assassin! Rebels! It's not that I don't want to be with you all. But look at my situation. I have greater responsibilities as a son. And history has proven it, Kilau. The Malays will always be conquered. History remains history, Usup. The future is determined by Allah. You can side with anyone. But now, those Englishmen have become more greedy in seizing the land of the Malays. And we must defend our land, Usup. What a bad attitude for a servant of God to allow his own people to be oppressed. Kuala Tembeling was attacked by the British yesterday. Many of our people were killed, including women and small children. Us? Keep silent? Turn a blind eye just like that? Really, Usup? What can we do, comrade? Don't blame the British for entering our land! Blame our own people for giving them the opportunity to colonize our land! You guys are the only ones who are zealous. The rest of our people? They just sit and watch. That's it. Eventually, we will all die in torment. Let us die in torment rather than die in vain. Don't just be good with words without looking at yourself. What's the difference between you and other Malays? You aren't a Muslim if you are afraid to fight. Rasulullah SAW said, "Help the oppressed. Of course the conflict will continue." Even the prophets could not avoid it and had to go through it. Abdullah bin Mubarak was not only the prophet's companion. He was among the great Muslim warriors, Omar. Outside the battlefield, he was gentle and patient. But when facing the enemy in a holy war, he was a great warrior among them. This Muslim warrior is impressive! No wonder you told me to learn silat. If that's the case, teach me as well. I also want to be a great warrior like you. Goodness. You're even scared of lizards, but you're dreaming of becoming a warrior. Mother. Look at Mother, Father. When the time comes, I will pass it down to you. But I need to tell you this. It is not to be boasted. Now, go to bed. We will continue tomorrow, all right? Yes, Father. What about the things that happened in Kuala Tembeling? Can't we do anything? This is what happens when our nation is divided. Foreigners take advantage easily. When they fear death, the cruelty in front of their eyes is justified. I don't understand our people. Why do they fear death when death is certain? It's better to fear whether there's enough for the provisions hereafter. What will be the fate of Malay generations in the future? Maybe by that time, our land would have been colonized. As long as I live, I will fight to the death. The Malays here are stubborn. It's better to end their lives. Despite being beaten, they still resist. You are going out again? Yes, I'm going to Tok Gajah's house, there are things to do. If so, have your dinner first. I already prepared the food. Never mind. I will eat later when I return. I'm running late. It's always like this. Lately, I see that you keep seeing Kilau. You know what I'm doing, don't you? If we rely on the villagers, only a few of them are brave enough. It's good to have Kilau, at least the fate of our people is defended. Dear, I'm pregnant. I really need you to be with me. Who else can I rely on if not my own husband? Please understand what I am doing here. I can't just sit at home and not even care what the outsiders have done to us. Imagine the future of our children. I do not want my descendant to be a slave to the colonialists. I understand what your intentions are for doing all this. But don't you forget your responsibility. That's enough, Kiah. Don't forget your duty to be obedient to your husband. Don't wait for me. I will eat later when I return. All right? The outsiders who are allowed to enter our homeland do more damage than benefit the people. They were given the power. It's even more unfortunate when the power has been abused. That's why we need to act fast, Father. We can't just wait and keep silent. If not, they will become more arrogant and conceited. We have to defend our dignity, Father. What happened to the neighboring village really tested our patience, Father. I don't want the British to think that we are afraid of them. They think we are a weak nation. Let them be. Let them think whatever they like as long as we know our roots. No matter how low those White people think of us, I'm grateful to be born as a Malay Muslim and a member of the family of origin in this Malay region. Never mind, Awang. I know the spirit of a young man that burns in you. So I hope Datuk Haji Muhamad and all the other lords will be wise in their decisions. Especially when choosing the leader who will lead all our warriors, Father. And if allowed, I'm willing to step forward, Father. God willing. I can't bear to see the tears and blood of our people spill on this land anymore. Enough of the suffering that our people bear. We can't keep silent anymore. The English are increasingly rude now. Within two weeks, three villages in Kuala Tembeling were invaded. The intention to help develop our land is just an excuse to fool the Malay rulers. In the end, we are trapped. Not only do the common people become their victims, but the scholars also lose the right to speak. If any of the scholars dare to oppose, they will be arrested and they will vanish, nowhere to be found. An agreement with the British was made and agreed upon. We leave it to the sultans and kings to decide the matters. Pak Deris, do you think that our law applies in today's situation? They have breached all the laws that has been agreed upon. They are clever in covering up the atrocities they commit. Their only intention here is to monopolize and control the resources of our land. Just wait and see. Lipis, Raub, Semantan, and Pulau Tawar. It's not impossible that everything would fall into British hands. We cannot remain silent. We must come out and oppose them. Let's declare war on the British. We fight! With what? What weapons and strength do we have to fight them? Do we want to see more of our people dead? Never forget the incident in Pasir Salak. How many of our people died due to their hasty actions in the past? Sultan Abdul Hamid, the Ottoman's caliphate, urged all the colonized Islamic countries to unite and expel those cursed enemies together. After discussing with Raja Muhamad, the person who will lead our warriors is Tok Gajah's disciple. Mat Kilau. We believe he is capable. Mat Kilau is still too young to be given such a huge responsibility. Mat Lela is more qualified to be the captain to lead our warriors, not this immature boy. Besides learning from Tok Gajah, Mat Kilau has also sought knowledge from me. His knowledge of Sufism is good. His memorization is good. His knowledge of trueness is high. There is nothing wrong if we trust a young man like Mat Kilau. I'm sure he can shoulder this responsibility. To be fair to everyone, we will have a duel between Mat Kilau and Mat Lela. Let's see who is more worthy. Ghuram! Even if you crush the tree, it won't change anything. Is it so hard to accept that decision? The strengths of Kilau are undeniable. So I'm not worthy? Am I not worthy to be a leader? Why don't I deserve to be the leader? Kilau and I are not much different. There is no gap in our battle skills. If you want me to fight him now, I have no problem. What are you talking about? Respect Tok Gajah's decision. Don't let us lose hope and forget the purpose of our struggle, be careful. I never lost hope in a fight. But for Kilau to be the leader, I would never agree. Indeed, he is good at martial arts. But to me, he is not firm when making decisions. The most dangerous trait in a person is jealousy. That's why I didn't choose you to be the leader. I have made up my mind. All the lords have agreed. -But Father-- -Be careful, Awang. Tomorrow, I want you and Kilau to go to Kuala Tembeling for you to see the situation there. I can't go, I have other business. Let our leader go by himself. Please excuse me. If Awang insists on wanting my place, allow him. I don't want us to argue later. No need, Kilau. We all want you to lead us. Among the people, there is someone who seems to have been chosen to take on the responsibility of correcting the people. Hopefully, you're the one, Kilau. Hurry up, our leaders are waiting. KUALA TEMBELING JETTY Count the money faster! Faster! Not enough! That's all I have. Confiscate their merchandise! Everyone, come quickly. We have been doing business here for a long time. Why do you want us to pay? We will not pay! Don't you dare defy the British! Wait. These bananas are plentiful. You have to pay taxes for all of these. Are you crazy? The bananas I brought aren't that many. Return them. I have work to do. Father! Don't you step on that sustenance! I was born on this land. This land belongs to us. All of you are robbers. British robbers! We can take anything if you don't pay taxes. We can arrest your father too. Father. Are you all right? This is our land. Malay land. The customary land of our ancestors. We have the right to do business here. And we won't give a penny to the British! Listen, British! This is the land of our ancestors! Get lost, British! British scumbags! Do you want to die, you bastard? You dare to oppose the British? They are our leaders, understand? Allah is the Greatest! British! British with infidel blood, I will expel all of your elements. Don't you dare disturb our jobs. Otherwise, we will torture you and all the villagers! Who are you? I am a servant of the Almighty who bows only to the one God. Allah is All-Knowing. As a foreigner, keep good manners. Don't ever cross your mind to be a king. The British are in power now! All of you will be our slaves. Make sure he doesn't get away! Kilau! There is no deity but Allah. What is he doing? Everyone, get him. Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. Kill him! Damn you! Get out of here, leave this place before your body is swallowed by the earth. Who will be swallowed by the earth now? Are you with the British? Kuala Tembeling Jetty has just been attacked. All the soldiers were defeated. Only one. Obviously, there is a Malay warrior who dares to oppose the British. -There's a hero among them. -Who? It's still unknown. But we are still lucky. There was another Malay warrior who came to help. If not, there would have been casualties among our soldiers. Another warrior? Awang came to stop you from fighting the British soldiers, is that true, Kilau? If Brahim and I were by the jetty, Awang would know better. If he's not satisfied, he should not have to bear a grudge. What? Does he want to prove that Tok Gajah was wrong for choosing Kilau as the leader? It's better to have a fight than to talk without investigating first, Wahid. Don't slander anyone. There must be a reason why Awang behaved like that. Whatever Awang's reason is, to me, his action is still out of place. You are our leader, Kilau. It's like one bad apple spoils the whole barrel. Things seen outwardly may not be the same in reality. Allah is the Greatest! Mamat! What have they done to you to the point you became like this? This is a test for someone who upholds justice, Father. They will not be able to shatter my soul and spirit, Father. I will work out the ways to get you out of this British prison. Father. Do not betray our nation just to free me, Father! -Mamat. -Promise me, Father. Promise me that you won't be a traitor! Listen here, Mat! I will get a release letter for you in a few days. No, let me die here! I don't want you to be a traitor to our nation. Time is up. I want you to be strong! Father! Promise me, Father! Don't betray our nation, Father! Father. Promise me! Who is the Malay who made a fuss at Kuala Tembeling Jetty yesterday? I know he's in this village. Answer his question! What? Do the Malays here eat too much that they cannot talk? Hey, answer us! Who made a fuss at the jetty yesterday? We never interfered with the work of White people. Maybe he's from another village. Don't lie to us. I know. -This is all-- -Don't tell him! Hey. You, White people. What you've done to us is even worse! All the villagers. Don't be afraid of these White people. Don't be a coward! They are just foreigners! Verily we belong to Allah and verily to Him do we return. If you move an inch, don't expect to see your descendants again. I am a Malay who will defend my nation. Are you not afraid to die? Even if the angel of death comes, I am ready to face them. Let alone cursed invaders like you. Who are you? Islam is my religion. Malay is my nation. Would I sit still and watch what you did to my people? The dagger is glaring. I'm… Mat Kilau. You dare to play with death? You Malays are cowards! You attacked from behind. If you're a warrior, put down your weapon. Let's fight, Mat Kilau. Ignore his words, Kilau! Come on, end that devil's life! As he did to our people! Let them feel the torment of our people all this time! Just kill that White man! Wait! Just say what you want. The British can fulfill it! I want the British to leave this Malay land. That's what we want! Don't think you're God. You treated our people like beggars in their homeland. Your time has come, devil. Kilau! Don't think you're the leader of the Malays. We have no problem with the British. No one will listen to your words. Awang! What are you doing? Where is your oath of allegiance to us? Don't be selfish. Because of you all, our people are the ones who will be the victims. Are you insane, Awang? Don't be a traitor! The British will not bother us if we do not bother them. No one should fight or oppose the British. What they are doing is for all of our benefits. You forgot your own roots, Awang. Has your ability weakened? Or is it your weak faith? If you kill them now, the problem won't be solved. The British will send a battalion of soldiers. And the situation will be even more chaotic. Don't you love your wife and your son, Kilau? Tok Gajah and all the Malay lords… Don't let your actions become the reason of their deaths. Is that what you want, Kilau? Think carefully. This is the only chance we have, Kilau! Let us all start a jihad! Kill them! Brahim! Yassin! Release them. White man. I promise you. You can do anything on this land provided that there will be no bloodshed among the Malays. I myself will make sure of it. No Malays will oppose the British after this. That's our promise to the British. You see right in front of your own eyes. The Malays will not be able to expel the British. Because your nation is a divided nation! Your own people betray you. Malays can be bought easily. That is why your nation will always be colonized! This is where we place our prisoners. Including your own son, Mamat. Those who are guilty will be tortured, beaten, and caned. And some of them died here. You are animals! Why do you imprison my son? My son didn't do anything wrong against you! All offenders must be arrested. Especially rebels. The punishment is very severe for a rebel like Mamat. My son is not a rebel! The English made their own laws as they pleased. Tell your British superiors to release my son today! Release him! We know you are among the people who are close with the Malay lords. Aren't you Haji Sulong's right-hand man? You need to cooperate with the British. Be our eyes and ears, all right? I myself will make sure that you and your people will be expelled from the land of Pahang! Never mind. The life of your son is in the hands of the British, but it's up to you to decide. But with the presence of Kilau and his friends, this is no longer an easy task, Syers. Mat Kilau is no ordinary man. Don't tell me you are afraid of them, Toga. You know how powerful the British are. If they unite, a million of your weapons will be useless. Because the unity of the Malays is their greatest weapon. They will never be united, Toga. The Malays are selfish people. There are full of jealousy among them. That is why they are easily colonized and trampled. We should have finished them earlier. Awang, Mat Kilau's follower, has promised that they will not disturb the movement of our soldiers again. I don't understand. Shouldn't Awang be on our side fighting against the White people? But it looked like he was defending our enemy. I'm reluctant to say this. But Awang seems to have been paid by the British. We haven't seen him in days. Maybe we're all unaware that we have kept dangerous cancer in the group. To discover human's evil, ask the enemy. To know the good side, ask the friend. Kilau. To me, he was bought by the British. Tell our brother, Kilau. Do not punish without proof. Use the gauge of justice and a rational mind. What is your real intention? Are you a devil in disguise or an angel accused of being a devil? Discuss and settle this nicely. What else to discuss? It's clear that he is with the British. -Say it! -I was trying to save all of you today! Instead of being killed by the British, I'm trying to obscure the British! So that they won't see us trying to rebel against them. Don't you understand, Kilau? Kilau! Before this, you were the one who was vigorously against the British. What changed your mind? I was wrong before, Kilau. I did not see the strength of our enemy. They have weapons that we really can't defeat. We will attack and seize all their weapons! Don't try to be smart making your own plans without discussing them! Father definitely won't agree. Seizing the British weapons is like stepping into the tiger's mouth. But what Awang said is right, Kilau. We really need weapons. Maybe this is the best option to eliminate the colonizers. I know the decision is still up to Kilau. And I don't deny that we do need weapons. But I still don't trust you. To go there tonight, maybe you and the British have set a trap! It's up to you whether you want to come with me or not. Use your sense, do not rush to temptation. No matter what, I will not allow it. It seems that the situation is getting worse day by day. to the point where our people are manipulated by the British. Is it a huge mistake when in the beginning, we ourselves allowed foreigners to enter our homeland? It's a mistake and they shouldn't be here right now. That's why from the beginning, I really don't like White people. I am certain they have evil intentions. They supposedly came to develop our land and help our nation. They're all lies. As a result, the dignity and rights of the Malays are compromised. What was written in the Al-Quran is surely true. Allah forbids the believers to accept the infidels as a leader. Because between us and them, there is a gap that limits the truth and falsehood. God willing. It's not that easy for the Malays to close their eyes while the authority of our Malay lords is violated and threatened by White people. We still have warriors. Who is our warrior, Tok Gajah? Mat Kilau and his friends? What exactly are they capable of doing against the British? I think we all need to accept the fact. The British are in power now. That is if we love our homeland. The affection and love for the homeland have nothing to do with the love for the politics that control it, Pak Deris. We and all our people love this Malay land. But that doesn't mean we must submit to the colonialists. Dear. I heard that the White people were making a fuss in the market earlier. And someone saw you were there with Kilau. Dear, please. Please don't do that. Don't mess with the White people. Don't worry. I know how to take care of myself. Why haven't you slept yet? Pity our child in that belly. Don't interfere in the affairs of the neighboring village again. You don't have to risk your life for someone else. Starting today, I don't want you to meet Kilau again. Because of your kind of thinking, many of us are trampled by foreigners. Tell me, what am I going to answer thereafter if I don't do anything? What is my responsibility and yours as a Muslim? Just let our fellow believers be oppressed? Because I don't want you to die! I need you. Don't shatter my hopes, Dear. If you want to continue, just leave me. I'm willing to live alone rather than have a husband like you! Don't talk back to me, Rokiah! Sometimes, I wonder. Do you care more about our family or Kilau and his struggle? I value my religion and nation more than anything else. Like it or not, that's the fact. I will never change my stand. I just want you to be with me and be my motivator. That's all. Hurry, all these need to be moved into the warehouse. Come on, we are running out of time. Intruder! What happened? We are faced with a powerful, cunning enemy. We need to arrange our moves while the enemy is asleep. It's like pulling the hair from the flour. Seizing British's weapons will give them the upper hand to attack us. We will be blamed and considered a rebel. Because of that, I do not agree with Awang's plan. You're right. But what about Awang? Does he listen to you? What if he carries on with his plan? You know how Awang is, don't you? Only Mat Kilau and his friends dared to mess with us. But they had promised not to interfere with British work. Like I said before, they will continue to mess with us. It's time. Fire the cannon! Destroy everything! Fire the cannon! Fire the cannon! I'm really disappointed with your actions, guys. The person I trusted all this time disobeyed my orders. Were you both really sincere in agreeing to choose me to be your leader? Or on the contrary, were you two actually envy? Where is your loyalty in friendship? What's going on in your head? You would turn your back on Kilau, our leader? Tok Gajah always advises. Did you forget? Obey Kilau no matter what the circumstances. We are preparing for us, Wahid. We really want to be ready to fight the enemy. If we don't have a weapon that can match them, it is impossible for us to defeat them. Let's not be reckless, Kilau. Reckless? So seizing the British weapons and putting the lives of our people in danger is a wise move? Don't think only about yourself, Yassin. Think about other people too. Do you think the British will keep silent? They will definitely strike back! So in what way can we fight them, Wahid? Do you think we can fight with the British with the weapons that we have? It's like we're surrendering to the British, Wahid. Don't be afraid of their weapons. Because we have more powerful and greater weapons than them. Which is our faith in Allah SWT. Mat Kilau! -Mat Kilau! -Mat Kilau! The British are attacking us, the jetty was set on fire! Many of our villagers were killed! That's right, Mat Kilau! They are heading to Wahid's house now! Hurry, to your house, Wahid! Wahid! Allah is the Greatest! Hurry! Why do you come here? What do you want? Where's your husband? Tell me! Where did he go? He's not here. Even if you chop me up, I won't open my mouth. Allah is the Greatest! I seek forgiveness from God. There is no true god except Allah, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting. And I turn to Him in repentance. I seek forgiveness from God. There is no true god except Allah, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting. -And I turn to Him in repentance. -Come on. Dear. Don't stop fighting your cause. I want you to know that I'm always on your side. Save this Malay land, Dear. When impetuosity takes control, men compete with each other to the point where they topple each other or even kill each other. Because of your impetuosity, the villagers were attacked. You are not good at planning, Awang. Forgive me, Father. I admit that this came from my own mistakes. I shouldn't have seized the British weapons yesterday, Father. Brahim and I are guilty as well. For the sake of Allah, we regret it and are willing to be punished. Punish us, Tok Gajah. Actually, Kilau tried to stop us yesterday. It's just that we didn't think it would turn out this bad. Wahid's wife has been killed by British soldiers. Are you satisfied now, Awang? Satisfied? Kilau. Forgive me, Kilau. Please forgive me, Kilau. Forgive me. That's enough, Kilau! Forgive me, Kilau. Forgive me. Apologize to Wahid, not me. Seek forgiveness from Allah. I'm willing to be punished, Kilau. Take my life if that can atone for my sins against Wahid and also the villagers. I'm willing to die in your hands, Kilau, instead of dying in the hands of the invaders who are cursed by God. If Allah created this worldly life without a hereafter, this life would certainly be disappointing. I love you, Awang. I love everyone and our struggles. And I'm sure our friendship and brotherhood will not be severed by this trivial test. The fighting spirit of our nation will continue no matter what happens, Awang. Remember again. The goal of your struggle is for religion! For the nation! A Muslim fighter must have a sincere intention and choose the right path of his struggle. Where do you think you are going? Syers! What you have done to our land has violated the Malay law and also challenged the sultan! The British did not only impose unreasonable taxes, but your soldiers were also cruel to the villagers! Your role here is to develop this land. Not to oppress and violate our rights! And don't forget the special privileges of the Malays, Syers! The Malays are spoiled with privileges. We did not violate the agreement. But it's your own people who break the law. They opposed because of what the British have done. We have been deprived of our freedom. We know the British want to reap the riches of this land of Pahang to be brought back to your country in order to finance your New World movement and colonize all Islamic countries! Then what about our people that you have killed and our weapons that you have seized? Don't blame us, but blame Mat Kilau and his followers! If you want to be respected, you need to earn that. You yourself have shown your ugliness. There is no need to fuss over things that have already happened. You'd better leave. Take care of your own communities. Shut up, you colonial British pirate. You're just a British assassin. You have no right to interfere in our affairs as Malay lords! Syers! I want to ask you. Where is Malay overlordship in the eyes of the British? This is the problem of the Malays. While we are struggling to develop this land here, you people are blind and keep accusing us British as criminals. We have Islamic principles in judging human beings. All the Malay lords will raise this issue to the Malay sultanate. Tell your leader. The British will not last long here. I have told you. Don't seek your death from us. Do you like to see your wife and child die in front of your eyes? Coward! Indeed, you British are animals punishing the innocents. I will not remain silent. And I swear as long as I'm breathing, I will avenge the death of my wife and child! And my people will rise to crush the British! You and your people will rise? You and your people are only united during comfortable times. Why didn't you act like other Malays? Obey the British rules. You would not lose your family. I prefer to die defending my rights rather than seeing my homeland seized by the colonizers! I will not be a slave to the White people. Being treated like an animal like you. I am not that despicable. Watch your mouth. I'll end your life. Well, I'm not an infidel who is afraid of death. Come on! Allah is the Greatest! We will attack them tonight. Even though I know we aren't ready, we have got to save our friend. Khairun Nas man yanfa'un Nas. The most worthy of human beings is the one that benefits others. I will give my life to save Wahid. Let me be the one to enter their fort. I'm willing to sacrifice, Kilau. Leave this to us to attack the enemy and face them, Kilau. This is not the time to blame yourselves. Acting based on emotions is only detrimental. Kilau. How are we going to fight the well-armed soldiers of the White people? Strength does not lie in weapons. Strength lies in wisdom. How we plan, strategize, and what we planned. Even though we die for friends and our homeland, this kind of sacrifice is required in our religion. Together. I want to take part. -Really, Usup? -Yes. I can't keep quiet, Kilau. I realized it. If we do nothing, Allah will inflict punishment on us. I don't want to belong to that kind of group, Kilau. I want to take part. Allah will help His servants who uphold truth and justice. So what now? Should we wait first before punishing Mat Kilau's friend? The death penalty for Wahid must continue. What do you want? I want the British out of here. He is sure to die today. Maybe he's crazy to come here alone. Kill me now! Or I'll chase you to death! Kneel! Kill him. Allah. Get ready! Do not weaken the spirit of my people from defending their rights. Rokiah. I'm coming. Something has happened over there. Let's go and see! Shit. Savage! Kilau! That's enough, Wahid. Enough! We don't have much time. Now is not the time. Mat Kilau! Usup! Kilau! No, Kilau! Let's go! Kilau! As what we had planned, we will hide here first for a few days before proceeding with the plans. Don't anyone dare to go out of this cave area without my permission. I have brought my friends. Hitam and Kelubi. Both of them have agreed to help us fight the British. They also brought some of their friends to assist us. I have tried my best, Kilau. I have invited more villagers to fight. Not many want to participate. These are the guys that I managed to gather. Not many are enthusiastic, Kilau. A thousand excuses were given to avoid fighting with the White people. It's all right, Hitam. Kelubi, although there aren't many that you brought, I really appreciate it and thank you. Let us remember. One mistake we make will only strengthen the British soldiers' position further. Think before you act. And never give in to temptation. Make a pledge. The cursed British colonizers and all the snitches must be fought to the end. This land of Pahang is sovereign land. All of us swear, Kilau. We'll fight against the colonialists until all of them are expelled from this sovereign land of Pahang. -We swear, Kilau. -We swear, Kilau. Make a pledge wholeheartedly. Let our belly burst, but never spill out the secrets of our struggle. I'm sorry, Syers. I failed to rescue our campsite. Mat Kilau and his men ambushed us and managed to save his friend. The Malays have no sophisticated weapons. But they can defeat British soldiers? If we had been here yesterday, all this would not have happened. Mat Kilau has already planned well. Brahim, Yassin, and I really feel guilty, Wahid. We feel guilty about what has happened to your wife. Forgive the three of us, Wahid. I know. I have sinned. And I should receive retribution. I won't blame you if you're angry and hold a grudge against me. There's no point in tainting my tongue to insult you, Awang. Not to mention blaming you all for Allah's will. This is my destiny as a fighter. I accept it. And I don't care about whatever tests that are coming up. Maybe this is the price of a fight that I have to pay when I have sworn to be with Kilau. I don't know how many more defenders of the truth were tortured, imprisoned, and killed. They died in a war to defend their rights. Since long ago, there were also prophets who were killed without committing any sins or any valid reason. Many of them met Allah before they could see the victory with their own eyes. I hold on to the fate and destiny of Allah. I am willing to sacrifice to ensure that my nation's future is protected. And I realize that we don't call this a struggle without sacrifices. The British are looking for you, Mat Kilau. If they knew we met in secret, we are finished. Let my heart be chewed as long as my people don't scream for help. It's time we must chase them out of here. We will attack them. The blood that flows in our body has to be purified with devotion to Allah SWT and loyalty to the homeland. If it weren't for Tok Gajah, we wouldn't be here. We are under attack because Mat Kilau and his friends seized the British weapons. Many have died. Don't you think you have done enough, Mat Kilau? Enough is enough! -That's right. Enough! -That's right. Enough! I feel sad with all you people. Let the deep river flows fast as long as it doesn't tear down the riverbank of our fighting spirit. All of you look in the mirror every day, what do you see? A warrior or a coward? If we split, we lose. If we are united, we are strong. We will not be able to fight them. Say whatever you want, Mat Kilau. Just stop your plan to attack the British. Forgive us, Mat Kilau. We can't help you. It seems that you are all more willing to see our grandchildren become slaves in their own homeland. Come on, everyone. Thank you, my fellow brothers. We do not have enough weapons to fight. Many of our weapons were destroyed and seized. How are we going to attack them? I don't care if it's enough or not. The Malays have challenged the British. We need to prepare quickly. And I believe the British soldiers are also planning to attack us right now. In these few days, the British soldiers will definitely go into the woods. We did what you told us to do, Kilau. And all the traps will be ready soon. Do we have enough traps to defeat them? Don't worry, Kelubi. I brought some rifles that we seized the other day. Although there aren't many, we can use them to strengthen us. Sorry, Kilau, during the chaos yesterday, we didn't have time to snatch all the weapons. If you insist, we can take all the weapons tonight. No, Brahim. The situation does not allow it. The British soldiers have laid siege around our village. Kilau. I suspect there is a snitch among the subordinates of the Malay lords. What do you mean, Wahid? Wahid is right, Kilau. If not, how could the British soldiers know the direction when they attacked Wahid's house? All this seemed to be planned. We have defectors among our people. Do not accuse without clarification, Awang. They are our Malay lords. It is impossible for them to break the brotherhood. This is not an accusation, Kilau. In desperate times like this, people are willing to do anything to save their own necks. Earlier today, Kelubi and Hitam told me everything. Tell Kilau! We found out there were three villagers arrested and imprisoned by the British. One of them is Mamat. Mamat? Who's Mamat? If you want to know, Kilau, Mamat is Pak Deris' son. And Pak Deris is the assistant to Haji Sulong. When he told a story, he lied. When he promised, he did not keep. When entrusted, he betrayed. This is a hypocrite. Who let you into my house? You'd better get out. Get out now! Intruders that have no manners. Do not talk about manners if you are a traitor of the nation. We all know what you did. What do you know? What do you know? Don't you make any accusations. You'd better get out! Not only did your son become a victim, but many others out there were even worse. Their children were killed and brutally tortured. But they are not traitors to their nation. You should have known their tricks. What they want is not Mamat, but they want you to betray your own people. Your doing has ashamed you. All the evils you committed are already known. I have no choice. They will kill my son if I don't do it! I don't want my son to die! I can't afford to lose my son! You're not willing to lose your son, but you're willing to betray your own brothers. My child was murdered! Scumbag! My wife was murdered right in front of my eyes! You used to be a nobleman. But now, you're a despicable man! Allah forbids those who defend and protect the traitors. I can only accompany you and our son up to this point. I have one thing to say. Whatever happens after this, you must continue to hide. And don't go home. Take care of Omar. Take care of Father Tok Gajah. I will remember everything you said. I just hope that many villagers will help to fight with you. It's true that not many are willing to sacrifice and jihad to the way of Allah when the time comes. I know you're disappointed with the attitude of our people. Father and I will help you to continue to persuade the villagers to go to the battlefield tomorrow. I'm sure there are still many who have a sense of responsibility to defend our land. Don't our people appreciate the struggle of their warriors? Don't say things like that. Even though no one appreciates it, the angels are witnessing the struggle you and your friends are facing. Omar and I love you. We look forward to your return later. Yes, Syers. They have left Pulau Tawar since yesterday. They must have looked for a hiding place earlier. I know. I have come to help. You all have to get rid of Mat Kilau and his men immediately. They fled into the Cabang Hulu Forest. They are hiding there. How can our soldiers get in? We don't know the jungle route there. I know the ins and outs of the forest there. And I will explain to you every way in and out so that they cannot escape. And you have to be careful. They are planning something big. After we defeat Mat Kilau, you must help the British eliminate Dato Bahaman. The history of the wars of the Rasulullah SAW in upholding the Kalimah Tauhid 'Lailaha Illallah needs to be remembered and used as a lesson to all of us. The spirit of jihad of the prophet needs to be embedded in our souls as a warrior. Because to this day, the Islamic world has never been peaceful with the threat of the enemy. We cannot allow the foreigners to arbitrarily undermine the sovereignty of the Malays and Islamic unity. Stand up for the truth even if it is bitter to swallow. Because this world will be destroyed if a man defends the truth when he only intends to benefit himself. We fight not to call for people's attention, but we fight at the command of Allah. And that is the real victory. Let's go together. Come on. Bastard. The enemies have surrounded us from all directions. Allah is the Greatest! -Allah is the Greatest! -Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! You're in my trap, devil! It's time for the British to be buried in this Malay land. Witness the rise of the Malay people! My nation! You are so weak, Malay champion. Kilau! Kilau! Yassin! Chase him! Chase him! Hurry! After him! Yassin. Remember Allah, Yassin. There is none worthy of worship except Allah. Allah is the Greatest. The Malays would not remain noble with tradition, sultanate, and culture only. But we will remain noble because of our faith if we hold strong to Islam. There lies the dignity of the real Malays. Oh, my brothers. Allah is our strength. To find strength, seek Allah! -Allah is the Greatest! -Allah is the Greatest! -Allah is the Greatest! -Allah is the Greatest! -Allah is the Greatest! -Allah is the Greatest! I bear witness that there is no deity but Allah. And I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. INDEED, THE EARTH BELONGS TO ALLAH, HE CAUSES TO INHERIT IT WHOM HE WILLS OF HIS SERVANTS. AND THE BEST OUTCOME IS FOR THE RIGHTEOUS.
