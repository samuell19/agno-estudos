Kate, don't you have no respect for your pa? Don't mean to hurry you up, Pa, but why don't you just hurry up and hurry? You just shut up, Henry. Hold your sister down. Blood, Kate. Thicker than water. - I don't want to! Gonna have me some boys. And there wasn't any one of them who wouldn't kill for me... and didn't kill for me. Or me for them. That's what you call family.

Oh, Freddie, stop being a baby! Hot water never did hurt your vital parts. Taking a bath every Saturday is disgusting. Turner boys don't have to take a bath all winter long. Yeah. Not, til June, earliest. Yeah and that's why my sweet lamb... That's why the Turner boys stink. They stink all winter long. Hey, Ma... Herman stole a pie from Mrs. Turner's kitchen. Oh, big mouth. Did you do that? Yeah, Ma, I did. You must've been powerful hungry, huh? Only ate half of it. Threw the rest away. That's good, baby. Mrs. Turner's dogs couldn't keep her pies down. They'd have to puke them up. Ma! Damn little tattletale bastard! I told you, and I told you, and I told you! You're not to curse in my house! What does that bastard want over here? We don't need a sheriff, Mr. Sheriff. Just wanna talk to you about your boys, George. Well, Ma takes care of the boys. You gotta talk to Ma about the boys. Hello, Sheriff. Talk! Come on! Come on! Want me to talk to you with the boys here? All of them? Sure, unless you're scared of my boys, Sheriff. Herman, give me that soap over there. And if you're scared of them, Sheriff, then I think I would keep my mouth shut if I was you. Wanna tell your ma what you did to the Turner girl? Herman? Lloyd? Wanna tell your ma before Mrs. Turner finds a man with a shotgun to come up here and blow your heads off? Now, come on, Sheriff. Why don't you stop pestering my boys? All they done was swipe one of Mrs. Turner's pies. They got definitely sick on it. That Suzie Turner's a smart ass. She's awful pretty. Suzie Turner does it with everybody. She don't do it with nobody. And if she does... she don't get her arm broke doing it. Now, come on, Sheriff. You know my boys ain't touched no gal. And may God rip out the guts of anybody who says that they did. Who tattletaled this lie? Sheriff, come on, who said this lie? Who said it? Suzie Turner said so. All right, then, you just spit on her for me. You understand? You just spit on her for me. She's a liar. You get him off our place. George, get him off our place! My boys is my boys, you understand? They're my boys. They're my babies! Understand? She's white trash, and probably filthy with disease, like all the other gals in this town! You understand? A smart boy, a smart boy stays with his equals! You understand that? The trouble is... my boys... my boys ain't got no equals in Joplin, Missouri. Come on, boys. Come on. Get moving. We're going. If the damn deputies left my boys alone, they'd be good. They'd be the best. Well, where did you get that car? I didn't know there was a car that good in this crummy town. Whose is it? - The Sheriff's. Good boy! Good boy. Thank you, George. Why don't I go along, Kate? I told you, you can't. You gotta stay here and... scare off anybody tonight. Shoot 'em up. Why don't I go along? If... You can't. Now, come on, I told you, you... You gotta tell everybody that me and the boys is gone forever. How will I find you, Kate? You're gonna find me. You're gonna find me someday in a palace. And if you don't find me in a palace, George, you ain't gonna find me. And when you find me and the boys in that palace... you come in through the kitchen door. And you remember, wipe your feet. Kate, I'm the father. You're a good man. You made good sons. You've got all the equipment... but, you know, you never could make a decent living. You never did mount me proper. I guess your heart wasn't in it. See his eyes, Ma? I couldn't stand it. You gonna divorce him, Ma? Shut up, Herman. There ain't no divorces in the Barker family. Never was. He's your pa and you love him, remember? You always love him, boys. You love your pa. Sure, Ma. It was only just that... George did everything the way he was supposed to do it. He was a born loser, and I ain't. And you boys ain't. You gotta fight the bastards always, boys. You gotta remember you gotta fight 'em. The world was sure changing from when I was a little gal. Women was showing their bodies in public, smoking, doing God knows what else. I'm sure glad I didn't raise me any girls. Who knows how they'd have turned out? You know, some people even tried to put through an anti-lynching bill in Congress? But a lot of folks went to Washington to help defeat it. Anyway, my boys and me were never much for politics. If we had to steal, we did it our way. Morning. - Morning. How much is it? 50 cents. - 50 cents? What, are you crazy? 50 cents just to cross over to the other side? It won't cost you nothing to stay on this side. Stupid! - Damn fool. I need a quarter. A quarter? How we gonna buy gasoline if we give old skinny a quarter? Shut up, Freddie. How much you got? Come on! Ten. Seven pennies, Herman. So, three buffaloes and one penny. How much is that? How's business, Captain? $17, Herman. 18 dollars and 23 cents. Good. Come on. Come on, old man, open up. Come on. Come on. Come on. Get him! Let's get him. Son of a bitch! God damn it! Get him. Help! - I can't... Get on the ferry! Let's go! Come on! Hell! Move over, Freddie. Herman, grab him! Grab him, Herman. Push him up! Push him up! Look inside his wallet, Arthur. Come on, get it. - How much you got? 2 dollars. - 2 dollars? Get over here and take his arm. Go ahead. He thinks you're gonna put your foot down, Herman. Maybe I am gonna put my foot down, Lloyd. Ma wouldn't like it. You don't know what Ma would like, Freddie. Ma wouldn't like it. God damn it, don't tell me what Ma would like! Herman had one of his bad moments. Didn't you, Herman? That's what I had, Ma. Baby? Herman, tonight you'll sleep with Ma. You'll sleep with Ma. She'll keep away all the dreams. I didn't mean to kill him, Ma. I know that you didn't, baby. I know that. In this world we can't always do what we wanna do, Herman. We can't always have what we wanna have. But, baby, we got each other. Now, come on. Come on, now. We're gonna sing, we're gonna sing a hymn. We're gonna sing something sweet, like the Barker family does. Come on. Ok, we're gonna sing "The Battle Hymn of The Republic", all right? Sing. Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Our troops was marching on! Once again! He has sounded forth the trumpet. That shall never call retreat. We listened to Billy Sunday and Aimee Semple McPherson and put a little something extra in the plate at church. I knew if God got his, he'd see to it that we got ours. We were all happy when Lindy made it to Paris. I liked a man who took things in his own hands. My Herman was a lot like that. Do you like me? What kind of dumb question is that? Do you like me at all? You're a customer, baby. I fucked you. But you're a freak. What do you mean, I'm a freak? Tell me what you want me to do. You wanna marry me? Or you want me to fix him up? Oh, hell, everyone knows what she can do. Ask her if she can cook as good as Ma. You should taste my pie crusts, little boy. They'd melt in your mouth. Tell you what you can do for me. Buy me a diamond ring. Never expected anyone to marry me. Still, I kind of dream about a diamond ring. I cut my finger on your friggin' glass. Anything we take out of this store is glass, I'll be back to shove a few splinters throu your head. Maybe I oughta just take out one of your eyes for good luck. No. Please, don't. Put it in a ring. Maybe sell it. Leave him alone, Herman. - Come on, let's get out of here, Herman. He got eyes like Pa, Herman. Leave him alone. Come on. - Come on, come on. You got eyes like my old man. Come on. You lucky son of a bitch. Come on, Herman. - I'm sorry. Come on. Come on! Let's get out of here. That's the most beautiful darn thing I ever saw. That's... Thank you, sweetheart. From me to you, Ma. Big baby. Gee, Ma. We hardly got anything from that damn jewellery store. Well, don't you fuss. Don't you fuss no more. Come on. Don't fuss no more. Mama's here. Another day, another dollar. Hi, there. I'm Sheridan. Would ya like to take me on a walk? No, thanks. I think you'd better. My brother, Herman, he's a... Thief! This boy's stealing your coats! Thief! No! Get him! - Get him! Gimme my dress! Gimme my dress! You stupid idiot. 1929 was a bad year for a lotta folks. The rich men was jumpin' outta the windows. And as usual, they fell on the poor. Well, at least my Herman and Freddie had a roof over their heads and three square meals a day. Let me know if it hurts, now. Hey, that hurt. But it hurts good. Ma taught us how to walk a back. Ain't no Barker boy can't take out any pain you got. Did your mom walk your back a lot? Yeah. Ozark massage, she calls it. Like when you're nervous before a big job, Ma will walk your back and sing. She sings: "What an Army of Boys we'd have if we'd ever draft the girls." Everybody would feel so goddamn easy inside, you could kill 20 cops and not even blink. What did you say? You have three brothers, Fred? Yeah. Are they all just as good as you are? Well, Herman, he's the oldest. Herman's a little rough. When Herman walks your back, it's kind of a beating. I mean, Herman, Herman would... kill a guy, just like that. Or beat him up. Yeah, he'll beat 'em up. Like a... 'Cause he enjoys it. What's the matter? You don't a... You don't like to beat a guy up, do you? No. Not unless I have to. Tell me something. What? You like to get beat up? Oh, Jesus! I got an idea. What you gonna do? What you gonna do? I'm not gonna hurt you. I really like you. ♪ It's a-me, it's a-me. ♪ ♪ It's a-me, O Lord. ♪ ♪ Standing in the need of prayer. ♪ ♪ Not my brother, not my mother. ♪ ♪ It's a-me, O Lord. ♪ ♪ Standing in the need of prayer. ♪ ♪ It's a-me, it's a-me. ♪ ♪ It's a-me, O Lord. ♪ ♪ Standing in the need of prayer. ♪ And God bless Freddie.

What the hell's the matter witcha, that guy's a creep! They did this to my Herman. They did this to my little Freddie. Oh, hell, Ma, they just got caught. Don't curse in my house. John Wilkes Booth just got caught. Jesus H. Christ just got caught. You with all your book learning. I'm not Mary, mother of God, so I'm gonna see that they get sprung. How you gonna do that, Ma? I'm gonna raise me a heap of money and I'm gonna hire the smartest and the slickest lawyer. Now the trouble with Jesus H. Christ, Lloyd? The trouble with our Lord was that he didn't have no smart, slick lawyer. Ma... you are dark. And what's that supposed to mean? Oh, well, I just mean you're very deep. Deep like a well. You know, Mama, sometimes I look at you... and I see a ray... of bright glory all around you. Deep, ink black. And deep, dark. Thank you, Arthur. My eyes have seen the glory. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Lloyd, when you're all working on those model airplanes, you get to acting awful silly. No, Ma. It's just that mine eyes have seen the glory. Hallelujah. Hey, Ma, how you gonna raise yourself a heap of money? We are going to do a big job. And this time, I am gonna go on it with you. Hallelujah. - Lloyd! Here Ma. Alright, now everybody reach for the nightgown of the Lord. Reach. Anybody moves, you're dead. Alright now, we're all gonna play a game. I'm sure you all know it. Called Simon Says. And this here is Simon. Open the safe. Simon says: "Everybody down on the floor." Look, buddy... Come on, hurry up, baby. Alright... Simon says that you, you, you, and you stand up. Now come on, Simon says: "Get up as fast as you can." Come on, come on. Reach! Alright, now, you... You two fat ladies, you come here. You come here and this nice little boy's gonna hug you. Alright, now, you two fat ladies... come forward, Simon says. Come on. Turn around, back up. You back up with me now. Everyone on the floor, Simon says you count to 100 slowly, or Simon might get awful mad. Now, come on, ladies, back up. Come on, fast. Let's go, fast. Go, come on. Baby, let's go. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen... It looks like those policemen don't think that we mean business. Well, we just gotta show them we do. Sweethearts, it looks like they just don't care a damn about you. Well, I'm gonna have to show them they better! Let go, you bitch, let go! - No, no! Let go, you silly bitch! They're gone! We did it! We did it, boys, we did it! There you go! - We're gonna get those boys out! We did it! We did it! Now, ladies, there's nothing here for you to be bashful about. My boys are farm boys. They're used to seeing pigs puckering around in the mud. Come on, you give me that there! Alright. Now, boys, you see anything here at all that shames ya? Liek Ma, you sure didn't pick any pretty ones. That's for sure Ma. Now, Lloyd, I wouldn't mind a piece of that plump little pink 'un. Now, you just stop that. You just stop that there talking dirty. And come on, come on, get in the car. Come on! I ain't exactly gonna curl up and die if I don't get her. Come on, get, get, get. Ladies, I want you to understand something. We is not sex perverts, you understand? I undressed you 'cause I don't want you running around too fast looking for help. Come on, kids, let's go! We've got to lose them! Let's go! It was God's will. If he didn't want us to have that there money, he wouldn't have left it for us in that bank. And I got my boys out of jail and back together again. Freddie brought his new friend Kevin Dirkman along, but Herman brought that there Mona Gibson. It's just plain nasty, taking that gal with us. Nasty and sort of sick, and it's just plain ungodly. Mona's all right, Ma. No, she ain't. She ain't country folk. She ain't Ozark. Neither is Kevin, Ma. That's right, Ma. Neither am I. As a matter of fact, you know, the only thing I am is about the 1907 mumble peg champion of Cairo, Illinois. Well, you're different. You're a friend of Freddie. Freddie likes you, and I'm aiming to pleasure myself with you. Ma don't wear no painting pencils. You wanna lay her in the backseat of the car? Be my guest, baby. You getting ready for me, ain't you, Mona? You want it again? Now, what would your Ma say, tiger? She'd say it's a long way to Memphis. She'd say a hell of a lot more than that! Do I get it or not? Ask big brother Herman. Herman, look, do I get her or don't I? Now you do. But when I marry Mona, and I'm gonna marry her... nobody touches her. You understand? Help her over. My pleasure. Mona, don't you feel like a silly ass? You mean, like, who do I gotta screw to get out of this happy, happy time? Like Ma says: "Another day, another dollar". Mona, do you really love Herman? That's funny. Who do you think I'm doing this for, then? For what, Mona? Well, it gives me a sense of belonging, wise guy. Even Ma's hating. Even with Ma hating me, see... see, that's more than I ever had before. I love you, Arthur. I love you, I love you. I love you! Sweet damn! Now, the idea of the game is we play 5 bucks a stick. Throw the knife, keep moving your foot out, the first man to fall is the loser. I move it to where you stick it? You know, sort of like that. Move it to there. Alright. - Good. Ten bucks a stick. - What, are you out of your skull? Come on, 10 bucks a stick. You know, Alice Joyce has one blue eye and one brown eye. Yeah, so what? So, Renée Adorée is cross-eyed. Yeah, so what? And Pearl White has really big feet. I mean, you can see it. What, are you crazy? Oh, she's very beautiful. See, like, you gotta have something ugly about you to be really beautiful. I mean, like, to attract the fans, don't you know? Herman, what do I got that's ugly? Mona, you are a true beauty. You do not need anything ugly at all. I mean, some little flaw to make you really beautiful. So, bitch. When's Ma coming back? She is fixing up the biggest goddamn deal in the business. Come on, doper, move out of the way. Clara Bow. She's not even pretty at all. Some of the things she says are really dirty. Thank you, my friends. You know what's ugly about you, Mona? Is your fat ass, your bow legs, and your goddamn fat lip! Hi, there, honey doll. You nuts or something? - Why? You got your shoes on. And where'd you come from? I swam. Clear across the lake. I'm gonna swim back. Oh, I bet you could swim the English Channel. I bet I could. My name is Rembrandt. Rembrandt? Oh, boy. That's my first name. Oh. - I'm very artistic. Jesus, lover of my soul. Hey, why have you got your feet in the water? I mean, with your shoes on. I guess I'm just artistic. Go on. Is... Is this your first summer at Bearskin Lake? Hey, why don't you give me a little kiss, huh? No. - Ohhh... No! I think you're out of your mind. Ah, come on. - No, no, I don't want to. Stop! You must be drunk. Oh, no. No, ma'am, no. No, I'm high. I'm high. Yeah. I take lots of dope. Oh, come on. - Nope. You know, I'd love to love you up... if I can make it. I think you're crazy. No, I like it. I really like it, even if I can't make it. Sometimes I can make it, sometimes I can't, honey-honey. You know? I mean, shove a lot of stuff in your arm, well, it makes you just want someone you can just... be loving around, that's all. You know, you don't need to hit the jackpot every time. Wait. You just... You just let me... You just let me go now, okay? You let go, please. Would you please just let me go, huh? Oh, no, no. No. Don't you see? Everything frightens me. I see a dog cross the street, I cross the street. I want to go now. You don't understand? I'm not people, see? None of us Barkers is people. Oh, I shouldn't have told you we was Barkers. Do you know what Barkers are? Huh? Huh? - I wanna go swimming now. Let's go swimming. - What are Barkers? Dogs? - Dogs? Yes. - Dogs. That's right, "dog." Yeah, dogs do it. And dog eats dog. Please... No, please, don't do this. No. No! No! It's all right. No, no, don't cry, little girl. It's... - No! - L... Please let me go! Oh, Jesus. Lloyd, you don't remember, son? Now, I told you and I told you. I told you that up here, we're not the Barkers. We are the decent, respectable, Law-abiding Hunters of Bearskin Lake. You don't remember? I know I forgot, Ma. But... she was just so cute, I had to take a shot at her. Alright. You just keep this pretty little gal here,... and you don't dare untie those knots... maybe sometime we'll all have a shot at her. Herman! Herman! Herman, I got 300,000 bucks all set up for us just to take. Just to take it. Then your dumbbell of a brother... he brings that silly goon of a girl up here. She ain't no goon, Ma. Lloyd's the goon. We gotta kill her, baby. We gotta. Herman, we gotta... We gotta drown her and drop the body in that bottomless lake. We ought to dump Lloyd's body in that bottomless lake, Ma. That's immoral. That's beneath my contempt. Lloyd is your brother. So? Let Mona kill him for us. That way we'll keep it all outside the family. Scrub my back, Ma. Ma... you reckon Dillinger's more famous than we are, or... we're more famous than Dillinger? Come on, honey. Baby, you're not concentrating. We're in trouble. Don't you understand that? We're in real trouble. You know something, Mama? There's a new song out. Mona heard it on the radio. It's called: "Murderin' Ma from Arkansas". That ain't funny, Herman. Sing it, Mona. Sing it for Mama. Go ahead, Mona. You sing it. Sing it. And then I'll have to do to you what I gotta do to that other little whore. Oh, Mama! Mona! Come on, Herman. Mama needs chores done. In a minute. Her name is Rembrandt. Her name is Rembrandt. Herman! Herman! You'll have do it yourself? There's nothing you won't do, is there, Ma? It's supposed to be a free country, Mona... but unless you're rich, you ain't free, and you know that. So I aim to be freer than the rest of the people. I don't wanna sleep alone tonight. Ma, I can't. Freddie, I don't wanna covet with you tonight, baby. Kevin, I want you. Well, we're all feeling kind of weird tonight, Ma. What the hell kind of a name for a gal is Rembrandt? That's a mighty peculiar name. Kevin, I've been promising myself you for a long time. And I want you tonight. Well, honey, I'm ready. Lloyd. What we had to do to that little gal last night, baby. We had to do it. We weren't bothering her none. She swam clear across that lake to come over here and mess us up, honey. Now, we gotta get out of here quick. Now, come on. Come on, I wanna hear a sweet song like only the Barker boys can sing. I wanna hear some sweet singing. Let's have a song. I got a song... from that there war where they killed all those innocent boys, remember? ♪ Ten million soldiers ♪ ♪ to the war have gone, ♪ ♪ who may never return again. ♪ ♪ Ten million mothers' ♪ ♪ hearts must break, ♪ ♪ for the ones who died in vain. ♪ ♪ Let each mother answer ♪ ♪ in the years to be, ♪ ♪ remember that my boys belong to me! ♪ Now, come on. Freddie, everybody. ♪ I didn't raise my boy to be a soldier. ♪ Arthur. ♪ I brought him up to ♪ ♪ be my pride and joy. ♪ ♪ Who dares to place a ♪ ♪ musket on his shoulder. ♪ ♪ To shoot some other ♪ ♪ mother's darling boy? ♪ Herman! ♪ Let nations arbitrate ♪ ♪ their future trouble. ♪ ♪ It's time to lay the ♪ ♪ sword and gun away. ♪ ♪ There'd be no war today, ♪ ♪ if mothers all would say, ♪ ♪ I didn't raise my ♪ ♪ boy to be a soldier. ♪ The cops were so busy shooting down the strikers during the Depression. I guess they just didn't have much time to pay attention to us. Everybody was trying to make a buck any way they could. I told my boys: "You just rob banks and stay out of trouble." And then I got this here idea concerning a Memphis cotton-broker named Samuel Adams Pendlebury... a nice, respectable family man with three kids and three million bucks. Jesus, Dirkman! You almost killed the poor guy. She never said anything about being gentle. Ma wanted him whole. Ma wanted him well. Since when did the sight of blood make you so panicky, boy, huh? Did you see his eyes? - What's the matter with his eyes? Yeah, I saw his eyes. What the hell y'all talking about? You dumbbells, you dang near killed him. If you wanna keep this man alive, you better get a doctor. That's right. For once, Mona is right. You nitwits! We gotta keep him alive! We gotta keep him alive! 'Cause we gotta prove that we got him. All right, Mona, you're gonna take care of him. No, but first... Nobody ever takes those goggles off. Understand me? This here hunk of meat is worth $300,000 on the hoof. And this time we're gonna get it. We've been planning this a long, long time, and we're gonna get it. No, now, Mrs. Pendlebury, you will be hearing from us... about where and when we want the ransom delivered. You understand? Mrs. Pendlebury, we need to know the name of his doctor. No, no, no, ma'am! He's perfectly fit, he... He has to have a doctor, that's all. Hell, we even like him, Mrs. Yeah. Okay, go ahead, shoot. I mean... Okay. And he's just fine now, ma'am. Now, you listen to me real close, Mrs. Pendlebury. Listen. I don't want you going doing nothing dumb like calling the cops or... talking to nobody. You understand? You hear me? Mr. Pendlebury is just fine. But if you go do something like that, he won't be just fine. We'll kill him. Sam's a good man. He's a good father. He took his boy on a camping trip up Kentucky. Boy fell out of a tree. Way the hell out in the wilderness. Broke his arm. Sam's no doctor. He set that boy's arm. That boy's got the best father in Tennessee. I'm finished. He's gonna be all right. God bless him and take care of him. And you take care of him, too. Listen, are you bastards gonna let me get up and take a leak? Well, are you? Just let us figure it out and we will do something. Can you hold it just a second now? - Yes, yes, yes. Only so much you can expect of a man. I know it. I know it. I know it. Come on. Nice and slow. - Take it easy, take it easy. Nice and slow. Don't you try nothing, now, you hear? Straight ahead. Do you think they'll raise the $300,000? We don't know. So far they screwed up everything. Made contacts with your jerk lawyer. He screwed up everything. He called the cops. How do you know he called the cops? We know, buddy. We know. My name is not Buddy! What are you, a wise guy? - My name isn't Buddy. Jesus! I could put a bullet through your brain... That still wouldn't make my name Buddy, sonny boy. You're right out of your mind, ain't you? I don't make my living the way you do, if that's what you mean, but either way, my name is Samuel Adams Pendlebury. But since you've seen fit to place me in fairly intimate circumstances, you have my permission to call me Sam. But not buddy. You're a real hot number from the loony bin, ain't you? Maybe. Now, why'd you call me sonny boy? Because you sound like a kid. I ain't no kid. All right. I'm sorry. How old are you? None of your damn business. Ain't you scared, Mister? - Not "Mister," sonny boy. Sam. Jesus lover! Okay. Okay... okay. Ain't you scared, Sam? I have a wife, two sons and a daughter... all of whom I love very much, so I'm not entirely without fear, no. What's more to the point, they need me. Yeah, they'd better need you, $300,000 worth. Why, hell, even if they got up the money, sons of bitches like you might just kill me anyway. We brought your own damn doctor. You just did that to prove you really had me. You really ain't grateful for anything, are you? All right! All right! I'm grateful. Thank you. What colour are your eyes? - What? What colour are your eyes? What difference does that make? My old man had blue eyes. Really blue. Why don't you take these goggles off and see what colour my eyes are, sonny boy? I can't. Yeah, it's a helluva thing to be without power, isn't it? Memphis is crawling with those lousy G-Men. Somebody must have called the damn President. Still gonna send the ransom note? - Nope. Arthur here is gonna phone that dumb Mrs. Samuel Pendlebury. But I want you all to understand something. We may still have to kill him. I don't wanna hear it. - You sit there, you little bitch! Ma, Jesus. Mama, it is time to feed him. All right. When I'm here, I feed him, you understand? You understand? - I understand. Mona, just 'cause I told you to take care of him doesn't mean that he belongs to you. All right, Mama. If I left him alone with you very long, you'd probably... Probably what? I know whores, Kevin. She'd probably turn him every way but loose. Well, that ain't gonna hurt nobody. And she might even do that. And from now on, you shut up and go play your mumble peg. We told your lawyer not to call the cops. He done called the cops. And I told your wife not to call anyone. She calls in the whole damn FBI. What kind of wife you got, Sam? She's a good wife. She's a good mother. Sure easy. With all your damn millions. I don't have damn millions. I got maybe two, three million, and it's not in cash, Lady. Sam, if she's such a good woman... why is she calling in the whole country? Sam? Don't she realize she's painting us into a corner? I'm sorry. Well, she better be sorry. Here. What... What am I eating tonight? - Come on, it's your supper. And with all your money, she can't even cook a decent meal. Yeah, she can cook better than you can. Listen, when I had the vittles', I was the best cook in our county. I just don't have time now, Buster, to bake you a pie. I'm sorry. "I'm sorry." My... My man said that for so many years... You just damn well don't say that no more, understand? I don't like for ladies to swear. It's not right. Some things better left to men. Now, you should try to control yourself. If his partner gets the cash... there'll be three NRA posters in the window. That's a really swell signal. Who thought of that really swell signal? Ma did. Peachy keen. If we get the money, you gonna marry me? Sure I'm gonna marry you, Mona. We gonna live with your mama? Ma's the boss. Peachy keen. Now, what the hell is that supposed to mean? One-and-a-half posters means they only got half the money. I'm pregnant. Jesus Christ! That car over there. Hey! Love me, Mona? Here, take care of that. That's a helluva of a way to tell a guy, baby. Didn't know you'd carry on so. Oh, shut up. Sam? They've gotta come up with that other 150,000 bucks. Well, they know it. I told them. It takes time to get that much cash together. Yeah. Sam, I didn't mean to keep you here this long. I know that it's rotten for you. I just have to roll with the punches, don't I? Would you like a drink? Yeah. Here. - Where? Thank you. - Welcome. Sam, I gotta roll with the punches, too. My goddamn teeth are hurting me... and I got a damn stupid gal running around the place pregnant. Shouldn't have said that, should I? No. You shouldn't swear, either. Funny, I don't mean to do that around you. I guess I can't seem to help myself no more. Apology accepted. Sam, would you make love with me? Three weeks is a long time, but I'm a married man. Come on. We being outside the law, as you would say... and us being gangsters... we got certain advantages. We don't have to pay no mind to those respectable, nice people rules. How could I make love to you, tied up like this? Supposing you just had on those goggles, and... And you could imagine I was anybody, even your lily-sweet wife. And you could do whatever you wanted to? Supposing, though, I was to hold you down, rip these goggles off, and gag you and tie you, make my escape? And supposing I had my boys sitting over there with a machine gun, you just so much as reach for those goggles and they'd blow your brains out? That'd be one sorry way to make love, wouldn't you say that? Don't you get so damn uppity with me, Samuel Pendlebury. I know what all you proper bastards really think. You wish you could be more like us. But you're scared of your neighbours, and you ain't got the guts. So you buy all those newspapers and you just spend your time reading about us, and you turn on your radios and you listen about us. Sam, you just got it all bass-ackwards. We're important people in this country now. I bet I'd have more fan mail than Eleanor Roosevelt if they could find us, and I'm prettier than she is. God bless her all the same. You're a proper, growed-up man, Sam. Yours getting to us. But we are getting to you, too. We don't want Mrs. Pendlebury seeing you look like a real mess, do we, Mr. Pendlebury? We bought you a brand-new white shirt with French cuffs. $300,000. She thinks an awful lot of you, boy. I mean, God, what a price. Half the time from the beginning, I didn't think we was gonna get it. And, Mr. Pendlebury, I bought you a pair of real black specs, and if you want my advice, you'd wear them. At least for a couple of weeks. We're gonna leave you some sandwiches, then you hike to the nearest farmhouse and phone. Boy, your kids are gonna be real, real glad to see you. And remember, now, Mr. Pendlebury, if there's ever anything we can do for you, you just get in touch. Anything. How would I get in touch with you boys? Well, hell. No way. Isn't this a dumb damn world? I wanna see his eyes. Are you crazy, Herman? He'd recognize us. I don't think he'll be able to see us in the light. Now the rest of you get over there. No. I'm gonna look at his eyes. I knew it. I think I'm going right out of my mind. He's got Pa's eyes. I can't see you. You take my word for that. But before I leave here, I want to say just one thing to you fellas. You are a strange pack of young men. And if I were your father, I'd take each one of you boys across my knee and I'd wail the living daylights out of you. We can take the goggles off. For Pete's sake, Ma, he can't see. How do you know he can't see? He can't. He can't. He can't see, Ma. All right, Arthur. You, with your smart allick lip. You get to kill him. You made so damn sure we can't turn him loose now. We can turn him loose, Ma. No, we can't! - We got the money, Ma! We got it all set up. - What's money? We need him walking around alive, broadcasting about us? He don't know, Ma, he don't know. When they start asking him questions... when they start showing him your pictures, he'll make one helluva of a good guess. Pull over Herman, right here. All right, Herman. Turn off the ignition. All right, Arthur, you. Go on. Arthur, you don't pray over him, you understand? You just kill him. Where you going, Lloyd? Lloyd, where you going? Lloyd! Damn it, Ma! I'm going down to see what they're doing. I'm gonna see what they're doing, Ma! Herman, they're buggy. Herman, now, you listen to your mama. Baby, you was my firstborn when I still was a little gal... and I had to tie off your belly button with my own two hands. There isn't nothing I wouldn't do for you, baby. There isn't nothing I wouldn't protect you from. There's nobody I wouldn't kill for you. Your brothers are standing out there with their hands in their pockets... waiting on the electric chair. Now you get, baby. You understand your mama? You get. I love you, Mama. ♪ Poor butterfly ♪ ♪ 'neath the blossoms waiting ♪ ♪ Poor butterfly ♪ ♪ For she loved him so ♪ ♪ The moments pass into hours ♪ ♪ The hours pass into years ♪ He's not dead, Mama. We didn't kill him. What'd you say, Herman? He's not dead. We didn't kill him. Who's not dead, baby? Sam... Sam Pendlebury. We didn't want to kill him, Ma. Now, Ma, like you say, this ain't gonna be a safe place. His whole territory. Sure ain't gonna be, Ma. We gotta move, quick. No, no. You're joshing your mama. - No, Mama. You're joking. You're joking with your mama! You're an old lady, Mama. You just can't go beating up on full-grown men like they was little babies. Just ain't ladylike. Now, you listen to me! I'm taking over now! We're gonna move south. Going down to Florida. You understand? Do you understand, Mama? Herman. Not you, Herman. Not you. Not you. Morning, sir. - Morning. Morning, ma'am. - Morning. Mr. Hanson sent word for me to make you folks comfortable as can be. Boy, that wide spot down the road, is that the closest town? Yes, ma'am. Sure is. That's Owensby's Park. Nice little old town. Real nice little town? - Yes, sir. Nice little town. Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Moses? - Yes, sir? What y'all do around here for kicks? Well, sir, there's an engine boat Mr. Hanson likes to play with when he comes down here on a visit. He takes it out there and tries to catch Old Joe. Thank you, sir. My furs are dragging, son. That's an... A nice little house... Who is Old Joe? Ma'am, Old Joe's a gator. Biggest gator you ever seen. Biggest gator you ever seen? - Yes, sir. Hear that, Arthur? Let's do us a little gator hunting. Biggest gator you ever seen. Lloyd? Son? What's ailing you? Lloyd? Ma, he's been sticking himself with that needle. God damn you, Lloyd! What are you... Why do you do that? Leave me alone, old lady. Leave me alone, old lady, old lady. Leave me alone, old lady. More and more and more, Ma! Lloyd... - Ever since that little girl. Why don't you take care of your brother? Why don't you, Lloyd? Lloyd, listen to your mama. Listen. That... That little girl... That little girl was no good for you. Your mama's good for you, Lloyd. When you're sick, your mama's good for you. Lloyd! Lloyd... Lloyd? Hey, Dirk. What do you reckon gators eat? Well, I don't know. Lot of people say they like chicken. Oh, boy! Look at this right here. - Oink, oink. I'm thinking... Too bad, little boy. I'm gonna get your little brown brother. Come here! Come here! - Take that son of a bitch, Dirk! Oh, boy, I got you, brownie. No, you old baby. I'm gonna feed you to a gator. Let's go. This place is like the end of the world. You mean you don't like it here, Mona? It's okay, if you're a Barker. - Well, you're a Barker now. Lloyd? What are you doing down there? Lloyd? Lloyd? He looks just like Moses in the bulrushes. You just playing gator, Lloyd, huh? He's dead. Get Ma. No. No! No! No! Not one of mine! Not one of my boys! No! No! No, no! No! No! No! God! This is Lloyd! Bright, beautiful one, Lloyd! I know he's got... Everybody's got faults, God! God, let me add to your blood, bastard! Let me add to your... - No! Mama! Lloyd! No, God! No, he won't hurt my baby... - Come on, Mama. Come on. - Come on, Mama. Come on. - He wouldn't do that! He wouldn't! Come on, Mama. - He wouldn't! No, Fred! He wouldn't take my baby! He wouldn't... Here! Herman, boy! Son Herman! Herman! Herman! - What? Your brother's dead, Herman! You're playing with gators. Your brother's dead! They're burying your brother! How did it happen? Herman, it was the dope stuff, he put it in his arm! Your brother's dead! - Just bury him deep. Lot of animals around here. That's right, Sheriff. They killed my pig. And they killed Old Joe. And they did it with a chatter gun, too. The kind they had in the war. License plates? It just could have been Tennessee plates. Do you want anything before I go? Where you going? Miami. Yeah? Drop me a line when you get settled down there. I'll be down that way pretty soon. Okay. Okay. Kate Barker! We have the house surrounded! Kate Barker! Arthur! Wake up the other ones! They're here! Hold it! Hold it! Hold your fire! - Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I'm not a Barker! You bet your sweet ass you ain't. Ma! Back, baby, back! No! Oh, my God! Look at that. The gun is jammed Arthur, it's Mama. Mama loves you. I love you! I love you! They're dead! They're dead. Herman. Herman! They're dead. All your... All your brothers is dead. Dead! Kevin's dead. He's dead. Dead. Dead. Kevin's dead. Honey, I've been thinking and wondering, you know, what... What you said, you know, about Lloyd. Lloyd's been buried too... Too shallow. My baby. You know? The... The way it is, any animal... Any animal can get at him. All the damn animals, they can get at him. Herman, my... No! Please, no, no! Stand back! The best one. The best! The best one! You bastards! He'll never get his chance! You bastards! You bastards! You always had everything! We never had nothing! Lord. You've gone through my children...
