The story spread into a second day, and reading slightly closer, I saw that it was a Howard student who had been killed. Then, on the third day, a photo appeared with the story, and I glimpsed at and then focused on the portrait. And I saw him there, frozen in the amber of his youth. His face was lean, brown, and beautiful, and across that face, I saw the open, easy smile of Prince Carmen Jones. I know I had love for this boy, Prince Jones, which is to say I would smile whenever I saw him, I felt the warmth when I was around him, and was slightly sad when the day came to trade dap and for one of us to go. He was kind, and he seemed to have a facility with everyone and everything. This can never be true, but there are people who pull the illusion off without effort. And Prince was one of them. A boy about whom I think of every day, and about whom I expect to think of every day for the rest of my life.

Prince Jones had made it through, and still they had taken him. And even though I already knew I would never believe any account that justified this taking, I sat down to read the story. There were very few details. He'd been shot by a PG County officer, not in PG County, not even in DC, but somewhere in Northern Virginia. Prince had been driving to see his fiancée. He was killed yards from her home. And the only witness to the killing of Prince Jones was the killer himself. The officer had been dressed like an undercover drug dealer. He'd been sent out to track a man whose build was five foot four and 250 pounds. We know from the coroner that Prince's body was six foot three and 211 pounds. The officer claimed that Prince had tried to run him over with his Jeep, and I knew... prosecutors would believe him. We know that the authorities charged with investigating the shooting did very little to investigate the officer and did everything in their power to investigate Prince Jones. This investigation produced no information that would explain why Prince Jones would suddenly shift his ambitions from college to cop killing. This officer... given maximum power... bore minimum responsibility. (VOICE BREAKS) He was charged with nothing. He was punished by no one.

But I was not on my part of Flatbush. And I was not in West Baltimore. And I was far from the Mecca. I forgot all that. I was only aware that someone had invoked their right over the body of my son. So I turned and spoke to that woman. And my words were hot with all of the moment and all of my history. And she shrunk back, shocked. -A white man standing nearby spoke up in her defense. -(INDISTINCT ARGUING) His attempt to rescue the damsel from the beast. He made no such attempt on behalf of my son. And he was now supported by other white people in the assembling crowd. The man came closer. He grew louder. I pushed him away. He said, "I could have you arrested." I didn't care. I told him this, and the desire to do much more was hot in my throat. And this desire was only controllable because someone standing off to the side there bearing witness to more fury than he had ever seen in me. -You. -You. PIERCE: I came home shook. It was shame. Rage. -"I could have you arrested." -"I could have you arrested." Which is to say, "I could take your body." "I could have you arrested." Which is to say, "One of your son's earliest memories will be watching the men who sodomized Abner Louima and choked Anthony Baez cuff, club, tase, and break you." I had forgotten all the rules. An error as dangerous on the Upper West Side of Manhattan... ...as on the Westside of Baltimore. One must be... ...without error here. Make no mistakes. PIERCE: But you are human. You will make mistakes. You will misjudge. You will yell. You will drink too much. Not all of us can always be Jackie Robinson. Not even Jackie Robinson was always Jackie Robinson. But the price of error is highest for you than it is for your countrymen. I am ashamed of how I acted that day. Ashamed that I endangered your body. But I am not ashamed of being a bad father. I am ashamed I made an error... knowing our errors always cost us more. ♪ (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ ♪ (MUSIC FADES) ♪ (WIND BLOWING) OPRAH WINFREY: Here's what I'd like for you to know. In America, it is traditional to destroy the Black body. It is heritage. There's no uplifting way to say this. I have no praise anthems, nor old Negro spiritual. The soul did not escape. ♪ (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ The spirit did not steal away on gospel wings. The soul was the body that fed the tobacco, and the spirit was the blood that watered the cotton, and these created the first fruits -of the American garden. -(BIRD CAWING) And the fruits were secured through the bashing of children with stovewood, through hot iron peeling skin away like husk from corn. It had to be blood. It had to be nails driven through tongue and ears pruned away. It had to be the thrashing of kitchen hands for the crime of churning butter at a leisurely clip. It could only be the carriage whips, tongs, iron pokers, handsaws, stones, paperweights, whatever might be handy to break the Black body, the Black family, the Black community, the Black nation. For the men who needed to believe themselves white, the bodies were the key to a social club, and the right to break the bodies was the mark of civilization. And that right has always given them meaning, has always meant that there was someone down in the valley because a mountain is not a mountain if there is nothing below. You and I, my son, are that below. That was true in 1776. It is true today. There is no them without you. And without the right to break you, they must necessarily fall from the mountain, lose their divinity, and tumble out of the Dream. They would have to determine how to build their suburbs on something other than human bones, how to angle their jails toward something other than a human stockyard. (METAL GATE CLOSING) How to erect a democracy independent of cannibalism. But because they believe themselves to be white, they would rather subscribe to the myth of Trayvon Martin, slight teenager, hands full of candy and soft drinks, transforming into a murderous juggernaut. They would rather see Prince Jones followed by a bad cop through three jurisdictions and shot down for acting like a human. They would rather reach out, in all their sanity, and push my four-year-old son as though he were merely an obstacle in the path of their too-important day.

JANET MOCK: Not long ago, I was standing in an airport retrieving a bag from a conveyor belt. I bumped into a young Black man. I said, "My bad." Without even looking up, he said, "You straight." And in that exchange, there was so much of that private rapport that can only exist between two particular strangers... CLIFFORD "T.I." HARRIS: ...of this tribe that we call Black. In other words, I was part of a world. I was a part of a world. Now, to call that feeling racial... ...is to hand over all those diamonds fashioned by our ancestors to the plunderer. We made that feeling. By then, I knew that I wasn't so much bound to a biological race... ...as to a group of people. And these people were not Black because of any uniform color or any uniform physical feature. They were bound because they suffered under the weight of the Dream. The people who must believe they're white can never be your measuring stick. I would not have you descend into your own Dream. I would have you be a conscious citizen... ...of this terrible and beautiful world. ♪ (MUSIC CONTINUES) ♪ MAN 2: In the years after Prince Jones died, I thought often of those who were left to make their lives in the shadow of his death. I wondered about Prince's mother. I searched for her, emailed her, called, made an appointment to visit. She was just outside of Philadelphia. It was a Tuesday. I seem to recall music. Jazz. Gospel. MAN 2: I thought she'd been crying. I could not tell. She was what people once referred to as a lady. PHYLICIA RASHAD: I escaped the sharecropper life of my father and all the others around me. I said to myself, "I am not gonna live like this." I integrated the high school in my town. In the beginning, I fought the white children who insulted me. In the end, they voted me class president. (CHUCKLES) MAN 2: I could feel the power and the presence of Dr. Jones. I asked about his childhood. He once hammered a nail into an electrical socket. Shorted out the whole house. He once dressed himself in a suit and tie and... sang "Three Times a Lady." MAN 2: I asked if she had wanted him to go to Howard. She smiled, said... Harvard. And if not Harvard, Princeton. And if not Princeton, Yale. And if not Yale, Columbia. And if not Columbia, Stanford. He was that caliber of student. But Prince was tired of having to represent. MAN 2: I asked if she regretted Prince choosing Howard. She gasped. No. I regret that he is dead. ♪ (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ It was unlike anything I'd ever felt before. It was extremely physically painful. So much so that whenever he came to mind, all I could do was pray and ask for mercy. MAN 2: I asked if she expected the police officer who shot Prince would be charged. Yes. MAN 2: She spoke like an American, with the same expectation of fairness, even fairness belated and begrudged. She spoke like a Black woman. Prince loved to read. Oh, he loved to travel. When he turned 23, I bought him a Jeep with a big purple bow on it. And I can still see him there... looking at that Jeep, saying... "Thank you, Mom." And that was the Jeep he was killed in. He had a family. He was living like a human being. And one racist act took him back. ♪ (PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ TAMIKA PALMER: -(FOOTSTEPS) -(CAR ENGINE STARTING) -(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) -(SIRENS WAILING) PALMER: She told me I needed to get to the hospital. Of course I went down, and I told them why I were there. She looked it up. She didn't see her. So the lady said, "Well, I don't think she's here yet." PALMER: PALMER: It's still taped off. I told the officer there that, you know, I needed to get in her apartment. Something was going on with my daughter. And he told me to hang tight. So it took another two hours or so for him to come. He kinda just went on to ask me if Breonna and Kenny had been having any problems. And I said, "Absolutely not. Kenny would never do anything to Breonna." I said, "Well, where's Kenny?" Like, "I need to talk to Kenny." And he said, "Well, Kenny's at one of our offices. He's trying to help us piece together what happened here tonight." (RADIO CHATTER CONTINUES) PALMER: (CRICKETS CHIRPING) PALMER: It was about 11:00 the next day. -(FOOTSTEPS) -(KNOCKING) He comes over and he says they were about done and they were wrapping up, and then we would be able to get in there once they got finished. And I said, "Where's Breonna? Why won't anybody say where Breonna is?" And he said, "Well, ma'am... she's still in the apartment." I knew what that meant then.

This has happened here in our only home. I do not believe we can stop the Dreamers because they must ultimately stop themselves. And still, I urge you to struggle.

(DISTANT CHEERING) I remember watching a pack of alumni cheerleaders so enamored with Howard University that they donned their old colors and took out their old uniforms just a little, so they'd fit. I remember them dancing. -They'd shake, freeze, shake again. -(CHEERLEADERS CHANTING) And when the crowd yelled, "Do it, do it, do it!" A Black woman two rows in front of me, in her tightest jeans, stood and shook as though she was not somebody's mama and the past 20 years had barely been a week. I remember walking down to the tailgate party. I saw the entire diaspora around me. Hustlers, lawyers, Kappas, busters, doctors, barbers, Deltas, drunkards, geeks, and nerds. (LAUGHTER ECHOES) The DJ hollered into the mic. A girl with him smiled, tilted her head back, imbibed, laughed. And I felt myself disappearing into all of their bodies. The birthmark of damnation faded, and I could feel the weight of my arms and I could hear the heave in my breath and I was not talking then, because there was no point. That was a moment, a joyous moment beyond the Dream, a moment imbued by a power more gorgeous than any voting rights bill. This power, this Black power, originates in a view of the American galaxy taken from a dark and essential planet. Black power is the dungeon-side view of Monticello, which is to say, the view taken in struggle. The warmth of our particular world is beautiful, no matter how brief and breakable.
