Ripped, corrected and synched by Fingersmaster. Enjoy! Take care of yourself, Jimmy Cobb. I need you so much. Now don't worry, Baby Blue. And don't let the sun catch you crying. You're still the greatest, Jimmy. Don't make this time the last one. Why can't you ever see me anything but dead? Because it's your damned destiny. One of these days, you're gonna come back to me with both your ears in your hands. No chance. I'll be rich. And maybe in half an hour. Anyway, whatever happens, I'll see you back at the hotel, okay? Okay, Jimmy. Detective Rojinski speaking. Yeah, it's so damn hot. Yes, Captain, it's all set. Right. I'll keep you posted. You two, go to your stations. - Follow me, you two. - Right. Are the cars ready for the roadblock? AGRICULTURAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF THE BEAUCE The cars are ready for the roadblock. You all know what you have to do. You go that way. You two, over here. Put on your armbands. Don't fire until I give the signal. Be ready! Don't fire until I give the signal. One minute. They're coming. Now. - Careful. One of our guys ratted us out. - Which one? Fire at will! Hurry! I have nothing to do with this! Let's go! Climb in! Let's go! 22-2-22-01, roadblock is set. Over. Let's go. We found the car abandoned on Highway 127. He has to be somewhere around here. I'll have the 68 blocked off. Between 12 and 14. - Absolutely. - We'll close this off. He has to be in this area. AI Capone. AI Capone. Just like on TV last Thursday night. Historic. Watch carefully, Joachim Maltravers. It's a major heist, my dear friend. Twelve. Right in the ass, you pigs! Doudou! Doudou Cadillac! Don't bother hiding. I saw you. Doudou! Doudou, come to my bedroom. Doudou. Come suck my tongue. Doudou, don't pretend you can't hear me, you raccoon! I can hear you, Madame Ségolène, but we already did it three times last night. So now I don't have the strength anymore. At least come get an eyeful. I'll touch you just a little bit, and I won't ask you to do anything. Why don't you ask the Arab? The Arab is too old. He can't do it anymore. Then ask your brothers. Horace doesn't want to. And Socrate has the clap. Come on down, Doudou! I warn you, if you don't come down, I'll slash the tires on your nice car. Dang! American dollars! American dollars! Enough money for the rest of my life! You heard me. Don't feed the kid when he gets home. This isn't a hotel. Do you hear, you slob? Don't feed him behind my back. Or I'll send you to the home. Yes, Mr. Horace. And where's the coon? - He might be hiding. - Why would he be hiding? He patted me on the ass again this morning. You sure you're not the one who's been playing with his zucchini? That's not true! What are you waiting for? Let's go! Here you are, Overseas. It's too late to eat. It's okay, boss. I'm not hungry. Good. Better that way. Hey. Move, you fat ass. My jewel. You took off, you fuckin' coon! Come here, you. Let's go! If he wants to play it like that, the coon's gonna get yelled at. He let Proserpine run off again. Go! Move! The Legendre family regrets to inform you of the passing of their son Jean Legendre on the battlefield on July 18, 1939 Shit. Fuck. Socrate! Hey, Brother! Have you seen the kid? If he asks you for snacks-- You're still asleep. I'd rather die. I won't go to the old folks' home. I'll kill myself. Yes, sir. Hi. I had to work all night again. Three oil changes, two flats. You sure you didn't go visit the girls in Chartres, Mr. Socrate? You think I have the time? It wouldn't be so bad if my gonorrhea wasn't acting up. That Tonkin thing is tickling me down there. Maybe you need a good corn-silk decoction. Your corn-silk decoction is worthless. You can't fight the VC. Is that why you're limping? No, that's because of my shoes. Size 7. On purpose. The Brits, who invented subterfuge, have a saying: "If you want to forget your troubles, wear shoes that are too tight." We keep hearing about you on the radio, Mr. Cobb. What are they saying? They were talking about your character. That's what got me interested. They didn't say anything else? That death follows you wherever you go. And you're not scared? Yes, I am. Then why are you here? You won't get out of this on your own, Mr. Cobb. In the Beauce region, no one thinks the same way you're used to doing. And people have a sharp eye. You'll have to rely on someone. Otherwise, you're a dead man walking. Are you suspicious of me? I'm suspicious of anyone who comes close to me. Either they want me dead or they want my money. Not me. I'm only thinking about myself. I won't say anything to anyone. Hey, little boy! Hey, kid. I'm talking to you. What's the matter? What do you want? Tell me, did you see a stranger pass by? Right now, they're passing by nonstop, armed to the teeth. Which one is yours? The one I'm looking for is wearing a tuxedo with a flower right here. Here. If you ever see him, call me at this number. It's a hotel in Chartres. A hotel, you say? 23-28-12? It's Lily's number, my auntie. Actually, my half-auntie because she's not my mom's sister. She's on my dad's side. Do you understand what I'm saying? Anyway, that's the number of a brothel. SAILOR AND FARMER I PLOWED THE SEA Coke? "Van Gasteren." Who's that? My grandfather. Not a half-grandpa. A master mariner. Twice sunk in the China Sea. How would you like to earn a hundred bucks? If the gendarmes ask you any questions-- you never know-- don't bother telling them we met, okay? Okay. That would really upset me. What's your name? Aniello Dellacroce. Little bastard! He tried to break it open again. Wait until I get a hold of you, you little jerk. Better watch your ass. No! Stop! No! Stop hitting me! You tried to break my padlock, you prick! Stop! Stop hitting me, or I'll tell my mom! Tell her to fuck off in her veranda. Help! No! Stop! You bastard! Don't let me catch you again! Bastard! Take heart, Aniello. A well-placed scar has never been a drawback to an adventurer. Okay, Aniello. A quick shot of the nitro booze. FUCK WHOEVER READS THIS! So, guys, have you come to stock up on farm products? Hello. Lieutenant Le Barrec, GIGN. We're looking for Jimmy Cobb. Jimmy Cobb? Cobb? Cobb. No, no one around here by this name. No, there's no Cobb here. Wait, is that the guy who's pissing off all the cops? The one who keeps shooting them in the knees? Why are you looking for him? The holdup at the bank. He stole over a billion francs. Well, hats off! Yeah, especially with seven dead and a kid shot through the heart. That's some blunder right there. At least here in the Beauce, you police can't put someone's eye out. Or else that'd be seriously unlucky. There's never anyone here. We'll come back this afternoon. Officer Marceau will stay with you. - Is that clear, Marceau? - Yes, Lieutenant. Right, stay there. Get yourself decapitated. Hi! How are you? How are you! INDUSTRY GARAGE - What is it? - Fill her up. There's no electricity. And-- And no gas? It's useless here. There are no cars. What, no customers? Because there are no roads. In short, you never see anyone around here. Yes, pedestrians. This is, as they say, a "destination." Maybe I can clean your windshield. If you still have water. I'll go check. Are you a fisherman? Funny, your gag. I'd say hilarious. Really hilarious. What are these exactly? Bait. I also have bloodworms and flies. I see that you're a poet under your hat. Can someone at least wash his hands? Of course. Take a right at the end of the pagoda. Follow me. What's this opera? A man's pride, sir. It's all that's left of France's empire. By the way, did you see a colonial with a black suit pass by? A black suit in this weather? I'm not worried. You're a sharp one. If he ever came by, you'd notice him right away. Official. Here's where you can find me so you can alert me. 28-12? Isn't that a-- A whorehouse, yes. I've been told already. There are cops everywhere. We've covered 190 miles. I'll have three more beers. My poor kitten. I'm gonna take care of you. Hi. This is the Blue Angel. Could I speak to Miss Lily Maltravers? She's busy already. Who's calling? It's Uncle Handsome. The one with the funny hat? Yes, and the one who knows the backdoor dance. - Udders? - Yes? Go get Lily, please. Her Uncle Socrate is calling. Okay, darling. Stay on the line, precious jewel. We'll get your family. GARDEN OF ALLAH What's going on? Lily, your Uncle Socrate is on the phone. Seems urgent. Don't move, darling, I'll be right back. I think it's serious. Hello? Uncle Soc? Were you under someone, sweetie? No, I'm on whip duty tonight. It's unbearable in this heat. Have you seen Chim, by any chance? No. You're worrying me. Should I have? Not necessarily, but the little bastard took off with one of my mopeds. By the way-- "Romeo Fabrizio, import-export." Does that ring a bell? Marcel, you mean. Maggy, my uncle saw Torontopoulos. Torontopoulos? Yeah, Marcel Bouzagran, the man who drives me. He makes my motor run. He's looking for Cobb, on behalf of Snake. - Snake? - Yes, Snake, the one who was with Jimmy Cobb. We took him in after the shoot-out. Cobb's lieutenant? That's why you saw Marcel. Everyone wants to get to the cash before the pigs show up. Not a chance. The cops are everywhere. One gendarme for every ear of wheat. This winter, there won't be any bran in the bread, just cops' ass hairs. I gotta go. My S-and-M guy is getting impatient. I have to read a whole chapter to him before he can get excited. Where's my little whip? If I see Chim, what do I tell him? Tell him nothing. Okay then. Bye, Uncle Soc. Kisses, sweetie. Damn it. FUCK WHOEVER READS THIS! What is it? You've never seen anyone eat? How many men have you killed, Mr. Cobb? I heard that whenever you escaped from a prison, you shot the warden in the knee. I'm a tough guy. Evil. With a heart of stone. And I'm at the end of my rope. So, tell me. Why are you doing all this? Don't look at me like that. Explain something to me. This morning, this was buttoned. Now it's unbuttoned. Don't force me. Let me go. If something should happen between us, I'll be the one to decide. What the fuck are you doing here? I'm looking for my brother. His tractor ain't here. Horace took it. He's in the fields. How can you live with people like this? At first, I had my roses. I mean, what my father left me. One day, the sailor decided to become a farmer. Wheat replaced the sea. Then, when my father died, he left behind 500 acres, with me in the middle, all alone. One summer, a man came to work here. Then Joachim was born. The following season, Horace came for the harvest. He stayed. Horace wasn't always like he is now. Humans get damaged, Mr. Cobb. If I helped you escape, would you do me a favor, Mr. Cobb? What can I do for you? Kill my husband. So, did he fuck you good? Come on, bitch, tell me how he fucked you. I know you're a nympho too. You took off your apron to go and meet him. The American must have the dick of an Arab. - So tell me. Tell me-- - Stop! Bitch! Whore! If you tell anyone about him, you're dead. Who are you trying to scare, you idiot? Can't you see? I have a hard-on at 700 feet. But there are things going on, important things. Shut up! Let me be a beast. Cobb might be hiding at the house. We may be millionaires. Chim found the loot. Look! - Millions, you say? - Yeah. Good God! I'm losing my hard-on. - Where is he? - Gone, vanished. - On the road. - A kid doesn't just disappear. We'll have to shoot the American gangster. They're tough as nails. He doesn't know what we're capable of. Come on. Come. Let's go. So? How was that? Did you like it? Twelve-gauge. Lead pellets. Wait. I'll put in a ribbed cartridge-- a Brenneke. You'll see. Designed to hunt wild boar. My brother wants to talk to you about money. Money, money! Money! A hole every eight inches. When there's nothing more left under your feet, you'll just have to come down. You still don't want to show yourself, Cobb? We'll make your life unlivable. Nothing to drink. Nothing to eat. Do you hear? Tough Chicago gangster. Do you think he could've jumped out? Impossible. It's too high. Plus, the dogs are there. Go out and check just in case. You're fighting back, man? Acting like an American? I'll show you. You hear? It's all just a misunderstanding. Just a mis-- Damn! Fuck! How did you manage that? - Are you alive, at least? - Who knows? Jesus! You want to set the barn on fire? Just wait! - You're gonna burn, Yankee! - What are you gonna do? You're gonna be barbecued, you hear? Barbecued! You turned me into a pyromaniac. - Don't set your property on fire. - I don't care! I have insurance against fire, hail damage-- everything! I'm insured against cows, against cholera! Do you hear? This'll warm up your balls, Yankee! Okay! I'm coming down. I told you we'd get him using only regional products! We got him! Are you coming down? In the Beauce, we don't have guns but we have inspiration. Let's go, Yankee! Let's have some white wine. We deserve it. Jessie! Ségo! Hurry up, guys! Hurry! Water! Quick! Water! Huffing and puffing at the drop of a hat. Maybe it's old age. I hope you didn't bring us the everyday stuff. It's not just to honor a friend. It's to celebrate a business deal. If it's warm, I'll blame you for it. I'll send you to the old folks' home. When it's the good stuff, it can't hurt you. Here, my boy. Jessie, Ségo, go clean up the barn before the men come back. The broken planks go in the woodshed. The dead dogs go in the quicklime hole. You're not drinking, Mr. America? I never drink. If you don't drink, then dialogue isn't possible. Without dialogue, we call the cops. You want to talk about money? We're taking a risk by hiding you here. Like a Jew during the occupation. How much? All of it. Minus your expenses, of course. Put yourself in our shoes. With the whole French army looking for your ass, it's gonna cost us money if we have to keep you here a while. I need a car. There you go! We have a car, a Cadillac. He'll feel right at home. The dashboard is in his own language. We need to find someone to go into town for me. It's not that hard. If it's not too challenging, we can send one of the broads. - We can send Jessie. - Jessie? My wife. What about the loot? Does he still have it? Yeah. If he still had it, we could take a look at it. This gnawing doubt I have... has something to do with my nephew. Did you run into a whippersnapper... a nosy boy who could have seen you? A little pain in the ass you might have given a few dollars so he'd disappear? The dollar I found in Chim's room-- are you the one who gave it to the little son of a bitch? You did, didn't you? - It's all making sense! - There you go! There's no-- The gendarmes are coming! The helicopter is back. Go clean yourself up. I'll take you home, Mr. Cobb. The gendarmes are already past the small woods. I'll keep an eye on the gendarmes. Let's go, goddamn it! I don't want to go to the old folks' home. I'll kill myself. I don't want to. Good day, miss. Are your brothers here? Which one of you is spending the night here? That's your assignment. My respects, madame. Marceau will spend the night here. Those are orders from the higher-ups. Can you put him up? - Yes, there's a bedroom upstairs. - I can't stay here. Come on, Marcel. We'll test the radio as soon as we take off. Marcel is such a cute name. Come with me. I'll show you your room. Call me, huh? - Let's go, Marceau. - Follow me. - Good-bye, madame. - Good-bye, sir. By the way, there's still no trace of the man you're looking for? Yes. People are seeing him everywhere. If you find him, will you shoot him? Madame, we don't just shoot people. Our job is to arrest them. Madame. Marcel will be all cozy in Chim's room. Oh! What is this? Let me do my work. Mike Alpha Romeo to Black Eagle. Over. And what's that? Black Eagle, do you copy? Hello, Lieutenant. You have everything you need? You have a nice view of the beach. You'll love it here. Is she bothering you? She's a real ball-buster. Leave the military man alone. Move! Get out, you filthy broad. Forgive her, Lieutenant. Let's go. Mike Alpha Romeo to Black Eagle. Do you copy? Over. This is Black Eagle. Receiving you loud and clear. And don't forget, Marceau, any sign of trouble, you shoot on sight. Roger that. But what do I do about the crazy one? Same order. Have fun, Marceau. Over and out. Is this Proserpine? What are you doing here? Who's gonna get blamed again? It'll be Doudou, as usual! Money! Money! Oh, my! Money! Money! What's it doing here? What's all this money doing here? THE BLUE ANGEL What are you doing here? I'm coming to enjoy life. You're gonna have a lot of fun with all that. Wait for me. Don't go upstairs by yourself. - Here you go, Colonel. - Just a drop. No, no, no. That's good. Go on. go on. It's good stuff. He's done for. Time to go to sleep. I can take him if you want me to. No, mind your own business. Watch your step. I can take him back. Yes. Leave us alone! Go away! Let's go, Sergeant. - Here you go. - Come here. No! Let me in! - Do you need help? - Damn it! Go away! Money, money. Money for Africans. I want to go in. I want you outta here! Get outta here, damn it! Are you gonna get the fuck outta here? Get outta here! I'll boot you in the face! Leave me alone, you scumbag! Don't touch me! I just need a little loving. Jessie, don't push me away. Don't leave me hanging. Let me do it, and I'll fall asleep. Don't touch me! Please! Get off. You're drunker than a skunk. I'm just a little hot. Don't judge your husband. Go do your dirty deed elsewhere! Find the campers and use your hand. Don't touch me. Don't ask me for anything. So you admit it. You're holding back. You're depriving me. I could get offended, but I won't. I'm thinking. If you don't let me do it, it means something's going on. Has the American distracted you? That killer makes you wet? You think I'm not aware of your little game? Always rearranging your hair when he's around. I'm not leaving offended. I'm leaving disappointed. It'd be too bad if I did something silly. You were asking for it. You're scared, you fleabag! You startled me. What can I do, Mr. Horace? Pack your suitcase. I don't want you around anymore. You're leaving tomorrow. You're going to the junkyard-- into the old folks' home. You hear me, you old rag? With the old folks. I won't go to the old folks' home. I won't go there. It's me. I put my hand on you. I like to screw. I like to screw because that's all I have. If I untie your hands, will you be nice to me? You'll fuck me, right? You'll fuck me good. You'll do everything I want. I'll give the orders. Everything I want. And for a long time. A long time. You'll send me up in the air when you come. You'll eat my boobs. You'll eat me. Say you'll fuck me good, or I'll call that cop. You'll fuck me, or else I'll scream. I'll scream. I'll scream. Stop! No, don't scream! Don't scream! Stop! Hey, ladies! You can't be sleeping already. Ladies? Hey, ladies! Look. We could take care of each other. We could tickle each other's bums. But it's just to make a little bit of love! Hello. Industry Garage. Uncle Soc? Am I bothering you? No, sweetie. I was putting a molar on the caiman. Have you put down your little whip? Yes, my workday is almost over. I just have a striptease at 2:00 a.m., and after that, it's sleepy time. And to what do I owe the pleasure? We found what you were looking for. Chim came to us. He claims that his name is Aniello Dellacroce. Put that little bastard on the phone. He won't want to talk to you. He's too busy. Maggy's right here. She'll explain everything. Listen. Right now, he's drinking scotch 20 years older than he is, he's fondling all the girls, and he's smoking a cigar. Feel a little. He just slipped a folded bill in Udders Adenauer's butt crack. - He says it's a good investment. - The little bastard. Hello? This is Snake. He also said that you're all a bunch of sleazebags. Let me be clear. The kid says that his father, Horace, has the loot. And we're about to go kill your shitty Horace. Damn it. Damn it. Don't piss me off! Now's not the time. Shit! I want to see my little brother. Wake him up. Your little brother isn't here. Damn it. I hope he didn't go back to see the Prussian campers. There or in hell, I don't care. I'm in deep shit. If he comes back, keep him home, Jessie. There's danger about. More than you think. I'm in deep shit. Is it you, my love? Madame! Madame! - What's going on? - What do you mean what's going on? Someone came into our house and killed my husband. I screamed, but you were sleeping. And you're asking what's going on? Who was it? Where is he? Do you think he waited around for you? There were gunshots. The boss yelled. He yelled. But one shouldn't meddle in white people's business. I wash my butt of this. Because one shouldn't meddle in white people's business. Never. My brother, we can't-- I was waiting for you. How could you? It's no more disgusting than all the rest. No more disgusting than my life. Then again, hatred helps wash everything down. Damn it! I'll sell everything. I'll move away. You think I can get away with it? Maybe. We need to clean up. The gendarme might come back. The murder's on you because it's your gun. But I'm still ready to help you. Quid pro quo. Don't forget. You need to go into town to see someone for me. That's your end of the deal. Then I'll go. What I did isn't in my nature. It is in yours. It's you. It should fit. My father was about your size. Is that your father? Yes. This killing will never stick to me, even if you accuse me. I'll deny everything. People will believe me. I wore gloves to hold the gun. You really thought it all out, didn't you? I knew it would happen, but I didn't know when. This brooch belonged to my mother. What's your name? Jessica. My name is Jessica. That's not French. So? I'm Dutch. You're an American. They're from the Beauce. See? No one is French here. The hotel is next to the church. Second floor, Room 206. Her name is Noémie Blue. You can trust me. One way or another, it'll be done. Too bad we can't make any plans with you, Mr. Cobb. You don't think I have a chance? None. I forgot. You're gonna have to kill Socrate. Good-bye, Jim. Have a good death, Mr. Cobb. Hey! Stop! Shit. No! No! Not my dragon, sir! Not my dragon! As we told you on the phone, we need to see your brother at once. Where can we find him? My brother has disappeared. I'm gonna drill you, man! I'll find him right away, but you don't know. There was mayhem in the Beauce last night. A lot of people got hurt. When I heard you, I thought the man in black was coming back. - Where is he? - Cobb? Did you see him? Jimmy Cobb sent me. Come in. The cops have been here since this morning. I've been scared to death for him for the last 24 hours. Where is he? Where is he? At my house. He's alive and at my house. Who are you? Why is he at your place? What does it matter? I only came here to tell you what Mr. Cobb wants. - You're to go to the airport. - Will he meet me there? Get two tickets for Madrid right away. Did he fuck you? If Mr. Cobb is not on the plane tonight, you're to leave without him. I won't go anywhere without him. I've never been anywhere without him. If Jimmy Cobb dies, I'll die with him. Do you understand? You didn't answer me. Did he fuck you? Yes or no? Don't pack anything. Hurry up. You have to leave immediately. I'll leave first. - And the cop on the street? - I'll take care of him. No. He didn't fuck me. No need to run. I'm here. Do you usually follow women on the street? That's all right. You're just my type. Go take a look, Aniello. Put our minds at rest. I really don't want to. I don't want Horace to catch me. Then you go, Lily. It's your house too. - Go on. - I don't feel like it either. It's boys' business. I don't want her to take the risk, Snake. The lady is my breadwinner. I love her. This isn't hard. Let's send someone unbreakable. You'll be our scout, man. Yeah, like a big boy. - I don't know if I'm capable. - Just go. Anybody here? Anyone? Hello! Is anybody here? Damn it. Is it... my brother's shotgun? Yes. Where's my brother? He's sleeping. - And Ségolène? - She's sleeping. And the farmhands-- the rag head, the coon? They're all sleeping. I came with some people. They're armed to the teeth. Come on, Socrate! Are you trying to hide something? Do exactly what I tell you. Or I'll shoot you in the knees. Even in the knee, a bullet makes a lot of noise. No. We'll do it in the cellar. Hey, Socrate! You have ten seconds to get back here. Wait. If he doesn't want to answer, we'll appeal to his family loyalty. If you're not here in ten seconds, I blow the kid up! I don't give a fuck! You can exterminate him! He's a bad weed! Say, your family doesn't appreciate you much, huh? You can all fuck off! What should we do? - Don't shoot. - Stop! Stop! I don't want us killing each other. There's nothing to worry about. It's just some family drama. My little lark. My parsley sprig. Why didn't you come back? We've lost a remarkable man-- my brother, Horace. Cobb iced him? Have some sympathy. My sister-in-law is a widow, I've lost my brother, and Lily has lost the comfort of her family. Where's the body? There. In the cellar. He really fixed him good. There's so much wine in here! It looks like a wine shop! Don't hurt me. What's so funny? I was thinking about all the chickens waiting for me in the sunshine. You know what else is funny? What? Speaking of farm animals, I'm a pig. A pig who was also waiting for you in the sunshine. - What are you doing? - I'm gonna kill you. But why? It's better if you're already dead when I shoot you in the knee. It's less painful. I want your colleagues to find you here-- in bed, naked, and dead. With a bullet in the knee-- Jimmy Cobb's signature. It's gonna be a hot one this afternoon. Where's my man? Well, I haven't seen him this morning. But honestly, last night at dinner, he had quite a lot to drink. Where are his quarters? Up there, in the kid's bedroom. That's where you're likely to find him. That sun! Is everything set up, Lily? - Can your pimp keep it together? - Who does he think I am? He's not there, and his gun is missing. And his radio's still on. Something's not right. Miss. Sir. My name is Lily, and this is Marcel, my fiancé. Your face looks familiar. Really? But I'm not so famous. Damn it. So, are we gonna drink that white wine? Tell me, my man is with the gimp. Is that it? Excuse me, Colonel, but "the gimp," as you so nicely put it, is a member of our family. Disability and virtue combined. Not like those foreigners who come onto the Maltravers' property... and give the clap to your gendarmes. Who are you talking about? The two Prussians who've set up shop in our cornfield, about 300 yards from here. - You can't miss them. - The tents. Take him to the hospital before he bleeds out in our house. We have enough to explain here as it is. Hop! Let's go. It's not so bad. Damn, he's heavy. Hurry, hurry! Hurry! Step lively! Move! Move! No, no, no! Not there. - No. In the trunk! - But he'll hurt himself! He's too obvious. Let's go. Hurry. Get in. Here you go. Take him away. - Are you okay, honey? - Go to the hospital! I'll hurry, my love. It's you again, huh? Good idea. You can do the digging. What are you waiting for? Dig! Dig, you asshole! You want the money? Then dig! - We'll split it. - I told you to dig! Or I'll blow your brains out. Commander, I have bad news. Cobb killed Marceau last night. The Yankee's gone. Copy that, Le Barrec. But things are worse here. Cobb came into town and killed Detective Rojinski in a hotel room. We even fear he sodomized him, either before or after. A monster! Horace, my poor dead brother, was right. It's the Beauce. That damn countryside closes you in. You're done for, Cobb! You've run out of steam. Dig! Is that the cash? Fuck! Fuck! If he picks up his gun, I'll kill him! Shoot! What should I do? I can't finish him off like a rabbit. Hello, Capone. Have a seat. It's the captain's armchair. It's a fine spot to die. I'm the one dealing the cards now. Hey, Capone. Shake it off. Chin up! The cops are coming and if they kill you now, we won't even make the eight o'clock news. And that would really piss me off. Wait for the TV people, Jimmy. Don't be a dick. I want to be famous. And you're the only one that can make me famous. Don't shoot! He's gonna kill me! Don't shoot! He's gonna kill me! He took a kid hostage! That really gave them something to think about. Don't try anything with me, Jimmy Cobb. You're under my thumb. I'm the boss. What's your name, kid? Aniello Dellacroce. And I'm the one who took all your dough. Hey, Capone! Come take a look! Now's not the time to have an inner life. You hear me? The cops are here. They're coming from everywhere. This is terrible. I need to make you look like a hero. The way you are, you look like just an ordinary guy. That's no good for TV. Better, huh? It's not enough. You can't kick the bucket without a smoke dangling from your lips. Scornful. Go ahead, you need to look scornful. They're all pussies! You scorn them. All heroes are contemptuous. Do you still have some matches? You don't want to start a fire, do you? Although, it would make for great TV. Put some inside the ribbon. Yeah! Awesome! Awesome. Jimmy Cobb's legendary matches. That's it. Everyone will remember that. At last! The TV reporters are here. The blue bus. I hope it doesn't start raining. Why do you give a fuck if it rains? Because I have a plan. Me, too. I want to become a legend. I want to be the one who killed Jimmy Cobb. Morons! Bastards! They'll kill us both! Watch out! They're storming us, like in the movies! Don't be a dick. I'm gonna die... and be with my father again. What are you doing? I'm saving your life, kid. And I'll keep my legend to myself. Have a good death, Mr. Jimmy Cobb. Shit! Let's go! My car! My car! Stop! I'm the one who killed Jimmy Cobb! I'm the one who killed Jimmy Cobb. How old are you? What's your name? Aniello. Aniello Dellacroce. What happened? Can you do it again for us, kid? It's not "kid." Aniello Dellacroce. I'm the one who killed Jimmy Cobb! Wait. Do it again for me. I'm the one who killed Jimmy Cobb! I'm the one who killed Jimmy Cobb! My money! My money! Money for Africans! Like I always say. Madame, can you say something? Don't worry, Mom. I'm here. I'm rich now. We'll go to America. You'll be beautiful. You'll always wear lipstick. I'll kiss you on the neck. We'll stay in bed. I'll choose your husbands, but that's for later. We'll be rich, we'll be feared, we'll be evil. We'll be real bastards. Yes. Real bastards. -- English --
