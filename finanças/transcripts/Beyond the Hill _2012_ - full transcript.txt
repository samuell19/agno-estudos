It's probabIly a weasel. BEYOND THE HILL -50 goats, huh? - Yes. So, where are the goats now? Just over there. Good job, Dad. We also have poplars up there. Did you see the walnut trees? I saw them. They've got really big. Good for carving. Mum! The chickens are going into the storage room. So, don't let them. Hey. Come over here. Come and say hello. Don't stare at me as if I was a savage. Come over here. Listen, if you hit it, I'll give you a cigarette. What for? Why? Don't you smoke? - Of course not. - Don't lie. Why would I lie? Then what's that pack under your mattress? That's for once in a while. OnIy when I'm feeling a bit down. Fuck off. - Let's see how you'll do. - I'm going to lie down here. - What will you give me if I hit it? - Take a look. This. - Dad. - Yes? Weren't you pIanning to enlarge the house? lt's big enough for Mehmet and his family for the time being. - Isn't it a bit small? - No, it's big enough for us. Anyway, it's onIy for the summer. - Grandpa? - What? Let's take out the rifle and do some shooting. You little rascal! - Where's your brother? - He's sIeeping down there, by the stream. Meryem. - Meryem! - Yes? Show the boy where the rifle is. Go down by the stream. l'll join you in a bit. Look. Take those bottles over there... ...place them next to that rock and put one of them on top of it. Place the butt on your shoulder. Yes. Make sure it's secured. There. On your shouIder. Now lift up. lt's an old rifle, so the kickback is strong. lt can easily put your shoulder out. Go on... - Awesome! - Well done my son. Sulu! Sulu! S?I? will teach you advanced shooting. He's a great shooter. Wait, stop. - Didn't l tell you to stop? - What happened Grandpa? - Didn't I tell you to wait? - l can see them and they are far away. - What if it misfires? Stupid boy! - Just look how far they are. - This is not a toy. -l can see them Grandpa. They are at least 10m away. Shut up! Don't be a smartass. That's enough of the rifle for today. Take Caner and go stroll around the popIars and the crops. Get a move on. Don't be afraid. He won't bite you while l'm here. I'm not afraid. - Come and pet him then. - No. l don't like dogs. - What's that? - l have to go. Come along Pasha. Those guys are famous for their stubbornness. He shouId just Iet it go. He's oId now. He should sit back and relax. He's coming. - What happened? - Did you used up all the cartridges? Your son has become a bit of a smartass. You are spoiling him. I told you before. Let the kids stay with me for a while. Especially Zafer. The fresh air would be good for him. Dad. You're really enjoying your retirement here. - Enjoyment is all you think about. - Who me? l'm not here to enjoy myseIf. This land is our heritage. - Who's going to take care of it, if I don't? - OK Dad, OK. My dear Zafer, come over here. - What have you been up to? - l took a nap by the stream. Isn't it beautifuI here? It wouId be good for you if you were staying with me for a few months. But your father says you don't want to. Here comes our littIe bandit. - Where's Sulu? - He had things to do. He left. - What kind of things? - How shouId I know Grandpa? - Mehmet, what did you have the kid do? - Nothing. - Come on kids, Iet's go fishing before it get's dark. -Fishing? l got a fish net from Naci. We'll use it for fishing. - There's no more fish left in the stream. - We'll give it a try. AIright then. It's your call. Walk further down the stream where the waters are deeper. Don't get upset though if you don't catch anything. l'll sIay a goat for dinner. - What's the occasion? - Why not? I want to feed my grandsons fresh meet. Maybe we shouldn't sIay it yet. Why not? lsn't the goat mature enough? Don't listen to him. We'll sIay it. That's it. It's better if we didn't, but... Caner. What the hell? Fuck off. There are almost no fish left, and you are scaring the rest of them away. Come on. Come on. Let's begin before it gets too late. - Let's wait a bit more. - Why? - After what they did this morning? - What if they compIain to the authorities? l wish they do. - Where's the knife? - I didn't get it yet. I'll get it. - Mehmet, go get the binoculars. - OK. Give it to me. Where did he go? Rocks fall down all the time during this season. - Is the water cold? - Ice-cold. - Come on in, bro. - No. - Come on. - No. - Come on in man. - Don't do that. - Come on in l said. - Cut the crap. - Get over here. - Stop it! - Don't do it. - Come over here. Come on for God's sake! I'm tired. Let me catch my breath. - Mehmet. - Yes. l suppose you are aware of the date, right? l am. l toId you before. Yes, you did. lf you can't pay... ...give me your goats. You can buy them back, once you have the money. - l was going to pay, but... - Whatever. Let's take care of this in a week or two. OK. How come there isn't any fish Ieft? Well done. Go get a few more. And put something on, it gets cold in the evening. -OK. - Not even a singIe fish... - You got hungry aIready? No. Where's Mehmet? He has to prepare the chops. l'll do it. You don't know how to. Fuck the... Look at this! - What happened Nusret? - They underestimated you. We were waiting for Mehmet to get the chops ready. It's not a big deal. Just a couple of minutes. Look at these. - May it be haIaI. - Of course it will. - It's not that easy. - Why's that? - Why? - Because this isn't our goat. How come? '- How come? - lt's not ours. - lt belongs to the nomads. - Which nomads? The ones beyond that hill. What? The other day, they were grazing their goats on our Iand again. When Mr. Faik heard them, he grabbed his rifIe and went to find them. He took Mehmet along with him. Mr. Faik beat their shepherd. He apparentIy said ''How many times have l toId you...'' ''...that this land has been sown. I don't want any goats on it.'' Then he grabbed one of their goats. He said to them, ''When you start acting like decent men, you can get it back.'' ''But if you insist on trespassing through my Iand...'' ''...I'll be confiscating one goat each time.'' So? So, that goat is this one. Dad. - Are you going to feed your grandsons stoIen meat? -What? - Are they going to eat stolen meat? - What stoIen meat? - Did you tell him? - I swear l didn't. - Dad this goat belongs to poor men. - What poor men? Bandits they are. l warned them several times. They pillaged my crops. They destroyed my popIar trees. - Why don't you warn them seriousIy then. - Are you making fun of me? They don't care about crops. All they care about is grass for their goats. ''Don't graze on my land.'' I told them. ''Go find pasture elsewhere.'' ''No'' they said. ''This is our grassIand since the Ottomans.'' How many years since the Ottomans fall? This Iand belongs to me now. Well, go talk to the authorities. Do you know how many times l've complained, to the Mayor and the Gendarmes. All they have to say is ''Mr Faik, they won't listen to us either.'' I know those men. l was the local forest office's chief for 15 years. You can't have them do anything without threatening them. - But did you have to kill their goat? - Don't stick your nose into my business. If you think l'm wrong, don't eat the chops. Eat the fish you caught instead. Meryem! Bring the kids over. And don't forget the raki. Sulu! Dinner's ready. ''No'' he said, ''lt doesn't look like me''. ''But, It's the spitting image of you Namik.'' ''No'' he said. ''lt doesn't look like me. Don't I know my face?'' ''l won't pay for it'' he said. ''Don't do it Namik.'' ''You shouldn't have written it on the sign.'' He said and then left. - Grandpa, can l get the rifle? - Just a second. Can't you see your Grandpa is telling us a story? - What do you want the rifle for? - l'll cIean it up and put it away. OK then. Zafer. What are you doing over there? Come here, you'll get coId. There's a fire over here. '- Did you took your pills for today, son? - No. Go get them from the bag. - So? - That's all there is to it. - Meryem? - Yes my dear? Are there any jackals around during the night? No. Pasha won't Iet them. You better come out before l blow your brains, dude. Goddamn it! - Who's there? - Crazy, crazy, you're so crazy. - ls that you? - Are you taIking to yourself... - ...just like your brother does? - Go to your Mum. Go away. Crazy, crazy, you're so crazy. - Will you say it again? - Yes I will. - Will you say it again? - l will. - Are you still going to say it? - l will. Who the hell was that? Come over here. You cowardIy bastard. If God wants to take me this is the right moment. What kind of a pIeasure whore are you? l feel like reciting poetry. - I never got to get you married off... - Here we go again. - This second bacheIor life has ruined you. - Dad, l'm Ieaving if you go on, l swear. - l found a nurse for him to marry. - Sounds good. Just when Zafer was at his worst, right after his military service. She 'll take care of both you and Zafer. I told him. - But no, he prefers to live like a punk. - Continue and l'm Ieaving. Can you look after the kids and your seIf? Who Iooks after Zafer when you are at schooI? l think Zafer is better this time round. He is better. Still, he needs someone to take care of him. That's enough Dad. - What's up tiger? You got bored? - A bit. - Have you seen your brother? - No. - Go have a look then. - He's probably having a waIk Grandpa. Regardless, go have a look. - Don't go too far. There may be wild dogs around. -OK. Let me tell him what to avoid. Just in case. Caner! Come on, have a sip. Take it easy, you'll get drunk. Take a bite as well. I'll make a man out of you. - OK. - Go on now. Don't make me angry. Don't interfere with my business. Dad, l didn't say that. Do you thing you know them better? Not even the fire can damage the forest the way their goats do. They are the nature's parasites. Why are you messing with them Yourself? Go file a complain. Who am I going to complain to? Nobody cares about my property. Alright, Dad. For heaven's sake. Whatever. Don't spoil the mood. Come on. Brother? Brother? What? - Why aren't you answering? - Why do you care? They send me looking for you. - AIright, l'm coming. - Mehmet is sneaking raki for us. - Do you want some? - Nope. Greetings Mr. Faik. Lower the flashlight so we can see your face. Oh, it's you Captain. - Enjoy you meaI. - Thanks. - Did you killed a goat? - Yes. - ls something up Captain? - Nope. - Just a routine patrol. - So late? - We do night shifts once in a while. - Interesting. Why don't you sit down Captain and have some meat? - Thanks. - You can take some with you if you'd like. When did you killed the goat? - Why do ask? - No reason. My stomach is sensitive to fresh meat. Well, we killed it today. Good. Enjoy. Thanks. Night, night. Night again. If onIy I were a sugarcane in the water. What sugarcane? What was that? Ahmet Hasim. We are not in a literature cIass, Professor Nusret. Sing a song to cheer us up. - Mehmet? Come on. - My voice is terrible. - Mehmet. - Yes Caner. - Meryem is calling you. - l'm coming. Take a sip. - Take it easy, you'll get drunk. - Mehmet! - Yes? Go away. - Mehmet. - Yes? - You stay. - I'm going anyway. - What for? The snacks are finished. I'll ask her to peeI some appIes. - l'll do it, you don't have to go. - No, no. You stay. Are you a saint or something? Why? l was about to ask you to peeI some appIes. l wish l was young. I should have been Sulu's father. For Heaven's sake! What? Am l wrong? - I would have made him a real man. - He's a fine man the way he is. He would be a real man. What is it you don't like with your own kids? Them? For God's sake. - They are mock men. - Don't you say that. Don't you ever get bored here, all year round? Sorry? Don't you ever get bored here, all year round? We are not staying here the whole year. Just six months. - What about the children's school? - The school? - Yes. - SuIu quit school aIready. Aliye? - What? - Aliye? She goes to school at Mut during the winter. So you'll just carry on like this, huh? Snacks are finished. How Iong does it take to peel a couple of appIes. l'll go check on them. When I don't work life gets tougher Meryem. I start thinking about my worries... ...of the past. And when I work, l know that all my work is for nothing. Nusret will sell everything after my death. May God bIess you with a long life. I think that... ...if you couId save some money... ...it wouId be better if you bought this place. - That's a bit hard. If your husband was smart enough... ...he would have bought haIf the land already. But with this mindset he'll probabIy lose everything. Meryem! What happened to the fruits? - Zafer, is that you? - Yes, it is me. - How are you doing Zafer? - Fine. What's wrong? Nothing. You scared me the way you came out from the dark. There's nothing to be afraid of. - Zafer, there's a transfer tomorrow. - l know. We need your heIp. OK, don't worry. Is your camouflage equipment ready? We took care of ours. What about yours? - l'll prepare it in the morning. - OK. Now we'll put out the campfire and go to sIeep... ...so we can start moving by dawn. - Yes, but... - What? - Make sure you'll be well hidden. - Don't worry. We'll cross with the herd. Don't worry, he won't bite. Move your dog over. Just keep on waIking. Take him away. He won't attack unless he senses your fear. l'm not scared. - If he attempts anything I'll shoot him on the head. -Just keep on walking. - Call of your dog. - Just keep on waIking. What was that? - Where did it came from? - From over there. - Where are the kids? - I don't know. Zafer! Caner! - I'm here Grandpa. - Zafer? Son? What are you doing there? Can you tell what direction the gunshot came from? Zafer. - Where did it came from? - I don't know Grandpa. - Where's Caner? - He was waIking in that direction. Caner! Caner! Caner! Caner! - I'm here Grandpa. - Thank God. Are you alright Caner? What happened son? Come on, speak up. - I'm fine Grandpa. - What was that sound. l fired the rifle accidentally. You fired the rifle? Why? l was pIaying with it and it went off. - It's not a toy, put it down. - Give it to me. You scared us. You are not to touch that rifle ever again. Let's go to bed. - Mehmet. - Yes. Take the kids and go get the beds and qulits. OK. Come on. Let's go. Meryem. - Is that you Nusret? - Is there any tea Ieft? Come in. There's enough for one gIass. - Are the kids asleep? - Aliye is, for a Iong time now. - And Sulu? - He is not back yet. - He is not back? - No He is not aIways back anyway. He has a place uphill by the trees. He sIeeps there sometimes. - Really? - Yes. He sIeeps there with his dog. He has become a bit wild, huh? He's a bit shy until he gets to know you. Maybe it's this pIace that makes people wild. - I don't know. - Yes it does. Stuck in the middIe of nowhere... ...days going by without seeing a human's face... - ...all aIone. - You're exaggerating. In fact everyone live within their own loneliness. Well, you've got the kids. lt's been 10 years since my wife died. l've been alone for 10 years. Ah Neriman. She was such a IoveIy lady. Actually... Neriman was IoneIy too. I'm not a good man, Meryem. I can't make peopIe happy. - Don't say that Nusret. - Forget it. Mr. Faik is really angry with you, because you didn't re-mary. I told you, Meryem, I can't make peopIe happy. He's fixated on a single issue. ''Get married so there's someone around to take care of the kids.'' Am I going to get married, or hire a maid? lt's not that simpIe. Anyway. I'll Iet you finish what you were doing. I'm going to bed. - Good night Meryem. - Good night. No Nusret. Stop. I'm shot. It's burning. I'm shot. It's burning. What's going on? What happened? What happened? - What happened son? It's burning, it's burning... - Where did they fire from? - I don't know. l didn't see anything. Meryem, go get a toweI. - Who shot you? Who was it? - I don't know. l didn't see anything. l heard a gunshot and next thing l know my leg was burning. It's OK. Nothing serious. OnIy a few pieces of the pellet. - I'll take care of it. - lt hurts... - Don't touch it... - What should we do? - I'll take care of it. - Mehmet, stop taIking and go get a toweI. OK. Meryem go get a toweI. Hurry. - How do you feeI? Any better? - Yes, it's better. With God's bIessings you'll be fine. - Mehmet. - Yes? I'll go find Sulu and send him to fetch a forest office jeep. Zafer isn't around either. Zafer! Zafer! - Caner, where's the other rifIe? - By the campfire, next to us. Zafer! Sulu! - Where have you been? - At my pIace. - Have you seen Zafer? - No. They opened fire and shot Nusret. Let's go. - Wasn't Pasha with you? - No. Mehmet, Caner. Come with me. They've gone too far. They brought us to this point. We'll show them... ...who the reaI trouble is. - Caner, go get the other rifIe. - OK, Grandpa. Look what they did. Bastards. How dare they? But wait. They'll see who's the boss in the end. - Grandpa? - What? - The rifIe is missing. - Where is it son? Shouldn't we be calling the Gendarmes? You shouIdn't mess with them. Be quiet Meryem. Where's the rifle son? - lt was there, where we slept Grandpa. - And where did it go? - SuIu, have you seen the rifle? - No. lt can't just vanish. Where did it go? - Have you seen it? - You left it right next to the log last night. So where's the rifle? Mr. Faik. Zafer, what's that rifIe in your hands? - It's yours Grandpa. - And what do you want with it? - I found it by the rocks on the hill. - They shot Dad. They shot your father. They got his Ieg. l heard the gunshot. Where is he? He's inside. lt's nothing to worry about. How did it happen? The nomads did it. First, they shot Pasha. Pasha? They shot the dog as well? - Weird. - Where did you find the rifle? - Did you get it from my side? - l toId you, l found it by the rocks. How did it get there? - Someone Ieft it there. - Who took it from my side? - How am l supposed to know? - Quiet. They are back. Do you see how they provoke me? Sulu, take the rifle. Mehmet, Caner you come along. Mr. Faik, I'm begging you, don't take the children with you. Tell me. Is Mut better or here? Mut would be better if there was no school. - Don't you like school? - No. - Your teacher? - No. - Why not? - Because he looks like a goat. - What do you mean? - You know, like a goat. He leaves the classroom and strolls around. He won't come back for haIf an hour. - Isn't that good? - Of course. It's nice. - Why don't you like him then? - l toId you my friend. He Iooks like a goat. Slience. God help us. They've shot them. They are shot. They shot my goats. They shot my friends. They've shot them. They shot my friends. My dear ones are gone. They shot my dear ones. They shot my goats. They've shot my friends. Zafer. What happened? - They shot... - Who did they shot? Zafer, who did they shot? My God, we were scared. - What happened? - We taught them a good lesson. Why did you do that? Why not? On top of everything, they were grazing on my Iand again. Me and Sulu opened fire and killed five or six of their goats. - Then they fucked off. - I wish you hadn't done that. Let's see what they'll do next. - How is Nusret? - Good. - Does he have any pain? - He doesn't look like he is in pain. - You? - Yes Zafer, us. - Are you aIright? - We are fine, don't worry. We've delayed our maneuver. Wasn't it scheduIed for this morning? We postponed it. We'll cross with the other herd. - I was so scared. - We'll do the crossing Iate in the afternoon. - You are coming with us Zafer. - OK. - Is there any probIem with your camouflage? - Nope. - Can l ask you something? - Go on Zafer. - Did you shoot the dog? - The dog? Don't be ridiculous, Why would we shoot the dog? l don't know... Maybe so it wouldn't reveaI your location. No such thing, Zafer. l heard onIy a single gunshot this morning. Zafer, don't you trust us? That's not the issue. - Well, did you see who shot my father? - No. We were asleep. You didn't see anything? No. Anything at all? Well, l saw somthing. When I heard the gunshot, l Iooked down the hill. - l saw someone disappearing into the trees. - Who? - I don't know - What did you saw? A nomad boy with a stick in his hand. Zafer. My dear. Are you OK? It's over Zafer. lt's over. lt's over. How many gunshots have you heard this morning? l didn't hear any. l was away, near my place. My brother... He's not doing well these days. l 'm aware of that. Follow me. Let's make a pIan. You're right. We shouldn't send Sulu away. Nusret can wait till tomorrow. We shouId look out for retaliations. We shouId keep watch. Sulu, grab your rifIe. Take the herd to the lower pasture. Take them along the main road. Hurry and get back before night. Be very careful. Go on. Caner, you go home. Look after your brother and your father. - I will be up keeping watch. - OK Grandpa. - Mehmet. - Yes? - You go watch the poplars. - OK. - Mehmet. - Yes? Take really good care of the poplars. - Of course. - Mehmet. Yes? - lf something happens to me... - God forbid. If these nomads do something to me... The popIars are yours. Go on now... Go. Hey, little one. - What? - Did you feed the chickens today? - Nope. - Would you like to feed them now? - Sure! Let's go then. - Didn't you hearwhat Grandpa said? - lt's OK. We'll be by the coop. Dad. Where were you coming form this morning? As l said, l was returning from the toilet. You didn't say anything. I was at the toilet. Where eIse could l be? Where's Zafer? - Wasn't he with you? - He came back to use the toilet. - No he didn't come here. - Weird. - What? - If you did something wrong... - Like what? - Where were you Iast night? - At my pIace. - Didn't you hear the gunshot?... - ...this morning? - No. - If you are lying... - Me! Lying? Faik will show no mercy. He'll have you arrested. l don't now anything. The nomads did it. What nomads? Cut the crap with the nomads. Maybe that insane boy did it, who came back this morning holding the rifle... You'd betterwatch the popIars. Make sure no one harms them. Don't get on my nerves. Go mind you own business. Go on! Grandpa... - Are the beans good? - They are good. What are you going to do without Pasha? We'll get another dog. Did Sulu say anything? - Like what? - Nothing. The nomads won't do us any harm. How so? Because we are nomads too. My mother said so. - Yes, but they are bad nomads. - Why? Look what they did to my leg. They shot Pasha too. Sure they did. Meryem! Meryem! - Weren't you going to make some tea? - I was just about to. Do it then. Run! Hurry up! - What happened? - They opened fire at our herd. Sons of bitches. Caner. Hold this rifle. Sons of bitches. I'll make them pay for this. Mr. Faik, let's send SuIu... ...to notify the Gendarmes. Meryem, stay with Aliye. Don't let her come over here. My brother. My brother. Caner. Stop it my son. Those who kiled Zafer... ...are over there... ...beyond that hill.
