ADAMS-FILMI Presents... "WE'RE ALL GUILTY" Screenplay... Organizer... Script supervisor... Makeup... Hair... Art direction... Editor... Music... Sound... Cinematography... Directed by... Producer... Production company... There's been a murder? Thank you. Honka to the office. Get a move on. A dead woman has been found. Try to make the morning paper. A homicide always sells. You got it. Leave me a spot on the front page. Good evening. What can you tell me about the case? A fight between drunks leading to manslaughter? I don't think so. The victim is a young female university student. Based on the textbook in her bag she's a linguistics student. Her name is Leena Järvelä. - Järvelä? Was it a robbery-homicide? - No. Her bag contains more than 5,000 Finnish marks. A crime of passion then? Has she been assaulted? - Can't say before the autopsy. She's been killed with a knife. Of the nine wounds at least three are fatal. It's easy to infer whether it's a crime of passion. That's all I can say, for now. This couple found the body. I'd like to hear your comments. It's awful that women can't walk alone in peace. I hope you'll catch the sick murderer? Please tell me how you found the victim. "A BRUTAL CRIME" "A YOUNG LADY MURDERED WITH A KNIFE. "IS IT A SEX CRIME?" You've done a good job. You can now focus on this story. It will engage the people. How did you like the implication to a sex crime? It's good. It will arouse people's interest. Go on with that angle. - I'll have more in the evening. As her best friends you can probably tell me something about the victim. For instance about her boyfriends. You were miss Järvelä's roommates? - Yes. To my knowledge Leena's only boyfriend was her ex-fiancé Antti Kajava. You said ex. Had they broken up? Leena divorced him a while ago. His jealousy got on her nerves. He could be waiting outside to see whether Leena came home alone. He did things like that. - Did you know the fiancé? Yes, he visited many times. Leena left with him yesterday. - Why didn't you say that right away? You never asked. - And we did say it now. My apologies. Do you know where he lives? - At puistokatu. Crime department. We'd like to see a tenant of yours, university student Kajava. He didn't come home for the night. - When was he last home? He did stop by in the evening. I only heard him use the bathroom. Well then, may we see his room? - By all means. I was just getting ready to clean. It may be messy. Thank you. Do you know this woman? - Mr. Kajava's fiancee? I've seen her. Have you read the news? - I haven't had the time. Did something unusual happen? - No. We police tend to ask all kinds of questions. What's it say? - See for yourself. It was written a week ago but it was never sent. "Dear Leena, when you read this I'll be gone. "Since you rejected my love I see no reason to live. "You'll be happy if I'm gone. "And I'll be hopeless if I continue my lonely life. "It's best this way. Make yourself happy. "Sincerely, the man who loved you until the end, Antti." He seemingly considered suicide. But saw it better to commit murder? What's that? He's guilty of murder? He's a murderer? "A murderer has escaped from Helsinki. "Last seen on a train to north. Is the brute on his way to Sweden?" Do you like it? - You bet. The other papers try to copy our headlines, but you're ahead of them. What's next? - I'll investigate her friends - and make the victim out to be a joyful person full of life. A real sunshine. People love to read that. And they must get what they want, it's what they pay for. Have you heard anything new from the police? They expect to make an arrest at any moment. Laine promised to contact once something comes up. Is that train headed to Kouvola? Yes, but there's a long stop at Riihimäki. Thank you. "HOMICIDAL MANIAC?" Are you Antti Kajava? - Yes. Come with us. Have you no luggage? - No. You would've been homesick in Sweden. I wasn't headed to Sweden. - Where then? Home. - Get up. Antti Kajava, a student in medical school. Any relatives? - None. Your parents have passed away? - Yes. Both of them? - They hanged themselves. Got it? That's unnecessary, it won't benefit you. But if it troubles you to share personal information... We can come back to it later. This is only preliminary. Is this knife yours? - Yes. What did you use it for? - To sharpen pencils in class. And not to commit murder? - No. Can you explain why a knife with your fingerprints on it - has been found next to the murdered miss Järvelä's body? I must've dropped it. - On that we agree. So you murdered miss Järvelä? - No. I couldn't have done it. I love her. Do you confess to murdering her? - No, I didn't do it! I said I love her. You won't confess to it then? - That's right. It's pointless to continue. You have a right to a lawyer. Who do you want? - Nobody. Surely you want a defense? - I don't need one. "Hardened criminal denies obvious facts. "Was the crime premeditated?" "Cynical murderer denies everything." "Is Kajava a sex offender?" "Even facts won't persuade the murderer to confess." "Are our laws too lenient?" "Will the murderer plead insanity?" "The murderer is still in denial." "When will homicides end?" "Murderer to face justice soon." "FROM A READER: Will a madhouse once again save a sexual predator?" "Do women have any safety?" "FROM A READER: We demand the death penalty!" "Civilised countries also have the death penalty." "Murderer in court today." Based on the aforementioned facts we can conclude - that the defendant Antti Kalervo Kajava has deliberately and with intent - killed university student Leena Tellervo Järvelä. Therefore I seek maximum punishment, imprisonment for life. Does the plaintiff, the mother of the victim, have anything to say? My client agrees with the punishment sought by the prosecution - but wishes to additionally be compensated - 25,000 Finnish marks for a ruined suit - and 30,000 Finnish marks for funeral expenses. The following logs have been conducted by the criminal police - and verified by the defendant. "On October 2nd at 10 pm... "...the defendant said the following... "After we were done talking I asked to kiss her as a goodbye. "Miss Järvelä refused so I tried to kiss her with force. "She resisted by slapping me. "I grabbed her shoulders and tried to pull her closer to me. "She managed to get free and insulted my parents. "This caused me to lose control of myself - "and what happened then is unknown to me. "In my eyes I saw like a red veil - "and once it was gone I noticed miss Järvelä lying in her own blood. "After the shock - "my plan was to travel to my foster parents' - "to tell them about what had occurred and to then turn myself in." Does the defendant wish to say anything about the testimony? No. The fact that the defendant had a knife on him proves premeditation. And as a medical student he knows where to strike. Three of the wounds were fatal. The number of the wounds may suggest a crime of passion. Antti asked Leena to go with him even though she didn't want to go. According to forensics the fingerprints belong to the defendant. I heard the defendant on the evening of the murder at around 11 pm - in the bathroom probably washing off the blood. The poor girl was lying in her own blood. I thought I'd pass out. The remoteness of the crime scene strongly suggests - that the murderer lured the victim there to assault her. As the defendant's defense attorney I wish to state the following... According to his own confession the defendant has killed miss Järvelä - but I contest the murder charge for the following reasons... The defendant's parents have both died under conditions - that were clearly caused by mental illness. His mother hanged herself in a mental hospital, - his father, an alcoholic, also committed suicide. The father's family has a history of - falling sickness and other mental illnesses. Hence there's reason to have the defendant psychiatrically evaluated - since according to my understanding the death has occurred - while the defendant was in a legally insane state. If he isn't entirely non-liable... Leave me be! I murdered her with intent. You must understand that I want what's best for you - under the conditions guaranteed to us by law. What would you know about what's best for me. You've made sure I'll end up in a madhouse. You want to lock me in there for my entire life. Calm down... - "Calm down." Crazy people won't calm down on command. They won't calm down... No... they hang themselves. Hang themselves... I'll hang myself too. They'll have bed sheets... I'm sure of it. Believe me, I'll do my best for you, but you must support my defense. Today you did everything to give a bad impression of yourself. I need no defense. I never asked for you. I want to end up in prison. I deserve it. I'm not crazy... Listen... - I don't want to. Leave me alone. Go away. The car is waiting. It's seven o'clock. "Will a murderer be once again saved by a psychiatric evaluation? "Murderer goes off in courtroom acting mentally insane." Good morning, mommy. The hero reporter has been out achieving great feats. Have you read the headlines? - Yes. You've succeeded if you mean to win over new readers. Why you! You know that reporters are only interested in truth. Cold, matter-of-fact truth. - The truth. Not sensations. - Right. And you know the truth before justice and doctors. - It's routine. I'm a routined newsman. Besides, all murderers are guilty. It's easy to write about them, as long as you have a headline. A murderer might get out of prison one day. Then it would be important for them to know what people think of them. But you've taken care of that beforehand. You're looking at a representative of public opinion. It's the murderer's business to think of their own matters. - Yes. Preferably before the murder. - Yes, yes. I'm tired. Let's go to bed. HOSPITAL You asked for an interview about a patient called Antti Kajava. Are you the reporter writing sensational articles about this? Just the usual normal ones. But now this case has aroused my interest in a particular way - as it seems in a way out of the ordinary. Both the murderer and the victim were university students. I suppose that's the only unusual aspect. There's always a reason for murder and in this case it's obvious. I could tell you my thoughts on the case after observing Kajava. It's best to start from childhood, as everything goes back to it. The defendant's parents lived in a rural region as farm laborers in a house - that would become his home after the defendant was adopted. His father was a well known womaniser and a hoodlum. After messing around with a woman - he had to marry the defendant's mother - as the host would've frowned upon scandals among his servants. The man continued his loose living style which greatly hurt the wife. She would often take her frustrations out on the boy, the defendant, - who would suffer innocently. The boy began to fear his mother. The father on the other hand treated him well. He was the only one the boy could trust and depend on. Shall we go fishing? - The fish won't bite yet. Run home and father will come and get you later. Bye. Go outside or stay inside, but don't stand there like a treegod. Put that thing away! Have you seen your father? I wonder where that bastard will spend the whole Sunday again? Playing cards of course, losing his money. Drunk again. Now there's a role model for the boy. He's going to lose another job to drinking. And then he'll face the road. Yes, you'll end up on the road too thanks to your father. On the road, to beg! Didn't I tell you to put that thing away? Dad! Stop! You're killing him! - Piss off! What's it to you even if I did? It's my kid! Antti, get up and go play. She's drowning herself! The boy didn't know it then that his mother would lose it - and that she'd end up in a mental institution. Or that he'd never see his father again, since he disappeared. It wasn't until years later that he was heard from. And he didn't know it then that his mother - would hang herself days later with a bed sheet in the hospital. But he'd come to know it later. Well, Antti, this is now your new home. You get to play until you go to school after summer. If you get good grades you can go there for as long as you like. Be a good and obedient son and we'll get along. Call me your aunt and him your uncle, understood? Yes, aunt. Go play and get to know the place. We'll call for you once food is ready. Whose daughter are you? It could be a dumb thing to do with the boy. His mother was mentally insane. Is it appropriate to hang yourself? And father runs away. I hear the father's family - has a history of falling sickness and other mental illnesses. His mother hanged herself! His mother hanged herself! I've caught you fighting twice already, Antti. Until now you've got off with a warning - but this time I'll mark it in your diary. If this goes on you'll get two hours detention and a mark for misbehavior. Is there a reason for the fights? Other than your fierce character? No, there's no other reasons. Well, sit down. Try to control it. Anyhow, you've been warned. Let's go! I'd hang myself if I were you. It's the teacher! You know the consequences. I warned you as I recall. Hey, these are yours, right? I think that's all of them. "Yesterday, a tramp, Johannes Kajava, was found hung on a tree with a belt. "An alcoholic, he was discharged from hospital without treatment. "The cause was likely a sudden mental disturbance." On your way to school? That's right. Hey, Kalle... - Yes? What's troubling you? Do you know what a sudden mental disturbance is? Yes. It's when you're a little out of your mind, though not always. And one doesn't notice it. But one pretty day you lose it and anything can happen. Do you know what falling sickness is? Yes. It's also one of those disorders that's related to, - to put it nicely, the nervous system. Why do you ask? It's been brought up in school. Bye then, I need to go. Bye. And they brought a possessed man to Jesus who was also blind and mute. Jesus healed him and exorcised him. I explained to you last time what it means to be possessed. That word is used frequently in the Bible. Surely everyone remembers? Inkeri, go ahead. To be possessed is to have falling sickness or other mental illnesses. Why do you always stay behind? Scared of a fight? It's not that, I'm scared of a bad mark for my behavior. Why do you always fight then? - I don't know. They say things that make me. I can't help it. We go the same route. We could go together. You won't fight then? No, I won't. Come on now. I'm only laughing because... You looked so formal like a principal giving a speech. Let's go. Do you have a bicycle? - No. Can you ride one? - I don't know, I've never tried. I got a brand new one yesterday. Wanna come and try it? I don't know, I couldn't do it anyways. You never know until you try. Come on. Nah. - Come on, let's go. Don't get upset. You looked so funny. It wasn't as easy as I thought. What did you get on your geometry test? - 9+. You must be upset for not getting a perfect 10. It's because I lack distracting hobbies. Other than you. Don't get upset. I'm so grateful for that 7 I got. It's all thanks to you though. That you bother to help someone as stupid as me with math. I have such an odd sense of fun. I like to help you with math. Speaking of fun, will you come to the school ball this evening? What good am I to anyone? I can't even dance. - But that's easy. Just move your legs to the beat and avoid the walls. That's all. Maybe, but it's no fun to me. Nobody even bullies you anymore and you don't have to fear fighting. They won't say it out loud, but I know what they're thinking. You'll come if I ask nicely? You're being paranoid, nobody's thinking of anything anymore. And if they do, so what? We're together after all. You'll come, right? I suppose I have to. Is it so bad that you 'have to' come with me? You know I didn't mean that. Bye then, let's meet here at 8 pm. Look, even Antti forgot about his world-weariness - and came to watch a peasant having fun. Shut up. Do I need your permission to come in? They meant no harm. They're just acting funny. - I don't understand humor like that. Just ignore it. We came here to have fun. There's music, everyone's dancing and having fun. Except for me. - If that's how you live your life - you're never gonna have fun. Come on and dance with me. Right, so that everyone could laugh at me. You're hopeless. Listen, you should go ask Mooses for a dance. You look the same. May I? Be my guest. A bottle of orange soda. There you go. Thirty Finnish marks. What are you looking for? - Have you seen Antti? He went to the buffet all gloomy like he had murder in his mind. Next up is women's waltz, I gotta go. May your most humble servant ask you for a dance? Don't be silly. I don't dance. It's a women's waltz. Surely you can't offend me? But I can't dance. Will you or won't you come? Jaska put it there and the teacher never noticed. Antti! What's wrong? Did something upset you? Look at me. Explain. Why did you make me play a clown in front of everyone? Maybe that was your intention. To make me look ridiculous. - Don't be silly. Nobody laughed at you. - I heard them. The whole school snickering at me, like always. Don't be crazy! - That's what I am, what else? Antti... Forgive me. Listen, let's forget about this. We've always had fun together. Sure, when it's just the two of us. If only it could always be just the two of us. The flowering season’s here now With beauty and great joy See you in the evening. Gaudeamus igitur Iuvenes dum sumus Post iucundam iuventutem Post molestam senectutem Nos habebit humus Do you think anyone's missing us? - Not me at least. Why did we steal the caps? You don't like people. You just want to be alone with me. Is it true what you once said? Nothing's more true than that. It's over now. It did take time. I mean school. And now life is supposed to be ahead of us. It may well be, do you doubt it? I don't know. The future scares me. Everything's been clear until now. It's always been certain that school goes on and that you're part of it. What are you scared of? That the future takes you away from me. Then I'll be lonely again. - Am I that important to you? Yes, you're the apple of my eye. You're the only person that's been a positive part of my life. You've always been good to me. Even in the first grades you were the only one who didn't bully me. You're the only person... I've ever loved. And I can't love anybody else. That means a lot. Not enough. Listen, I've realized in all these years - that when it comes to some things you're just useless. What do you mean? Considering you got four A's, you're pretty dumb. How come? Must I as a poor D student reach for the stars and - ask you to get engaged with me? Are you serious? You're so selfish that only you have the right to be in love. Someone else might fall in love too. - Leena, Leena, Leena! Stop saying it over and over, "Leena, Leena, Leena." Tell me, will you take me? - You seriously ask me that? I hope you don't dislike my taste? - Are you completely serious? If I were a man, in this situation - I'd make temporary rings from tree bark. Wait here, don't go anywhere. Would you put this where it belongs? Are we really engaged now? We sure are. I'll get real rings for us as soon as I can. Let's do it in Helsinki after summer, once I've returned from France. Oh, right, you go with your father. - Yes. Let's not shock them just yet. Your family surely won't accept me. Whatever happens, I accept you. You've heard about... You know about my parents. They weren't exactly healthy. They were... mentally ill. What's that got to do with this? You see, disorders like that can be hereditary. You never know, I could be... Stop believing in fairy tales. All those things about Mendell and the rest are nonsense. I've told you I plan to become a doctor. But I haven't told you - I plan to become a neurologist, a psychiatrist. I want to help people with a similar childhood. I want to teach them to live, to not fear people. Teach them to love others... - Listen... Then you must yourself first learn about life and love. We've been engaged for so long already - and you haven't even kissed me today any more than before. I've never even thought of touching you like that. You're too sacred to me for that. I don't want to be any old and withered saint! I suppose it's best I do it first then. How did it feel? It was... heavenly. That was my first kiss. Including my childhood. There's more of that. You'll see. Get at least three skips and I'll grant your wish. I'm the spirit of the woods and that's a promise. I wish nothing will ever separate us. Listen, I forgot that magic is only magic on Midsummer's night. Let's go see what the others are doing. "THE DEFENSE RESTS ON MENTAL DISORDER THEORY. "IS KAJAVA PRETENDING TO BE MENTALLY INSANE?" "WHO'S GUILTY IN THE END? "IS KAJAVA A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES? "SOCIETY OUGHT TO PUNISH ITSELF." See you. Take this to the editor. - On it. You're all done. What happens to the guy? - We'll see. He goes to prison? - What's it to you? Shall we go for a drink? - Sure, let's go. I'll just clean up this table. - Let's do that. It matters what you write. Even a murderer is just a human being. A murder could be a statement against the very society - that made them a murderer. But so far your stories contradict you. But I haven't written anything yet. I've sold papers, played around with peoples' lives. That stops now! - What if they want to sell a lot? It's not my problem. Why? Who's this? - The editor. Miss, a gin and grapefruit. Is it important? - No, I'm here just because. Is my story on the front page? - No, it's in the wastebasket. Thank you, miss. What the hell? Was it not good? - It was, kind of. But it's not for a newspaper. - Can't a newspaper tell the truth? Do you fear losing readers? - What do you know about truth? What does anyone know? Even the law doesn't. It's made up by people. But it must take its course. It won't improve if you tamper with it. - No, it won't. I don't believe there will be any miscarriage of justice in this case. If you won't publish it, I'll quit. - Be my guest. Will it benefit the Kajava story? Then why did you let me write contradicting stories - where the murderer has already been condemned? That's different. That's how it should be. Of course murderers have their reasons justifying their actions. The reactions of society and the press must oppose the murderer. You see, if the murderer is a victim of circumstances - then the court of law must only punish, - and it mustn't begin to reform social aspects. You see, under no circumstances - can anyone take another person's life. A murder is always a murder. You see, life wasn't created so it can be destroyed. I'm done writing about crime. - We'll see about that. I suppose you'll go hear the verdict tomorrow? - Yes. But not for your paper. - Don't be childish. No paper accepts stories like yours today, that's for sure. You could try "True Stories." Shut up. Miss, a cut brandy! At the end of August, this year, - miss Järvelä returned from abroad and stayed in Helsinki. Hi, it's so nice to see you. You finally came back. - Greetings from Paris. Did you have fun? - Yes. Will you now stay here? - Yes. What have you been up to? - I bought all these books. Studying them makes one smarter. MENTAL ILLNESSES Listen, wanna go swimming tomorrow? Let's ride our bikes to a beach. - Sure. Come here at 11 o'clock. - I will. I forgot... I have them now. Hi. I was in the middle of packing. It's very hot outside. - Yes, a proper Indian summer. It feels so strange... Like this moment isn't real. Like all this had happened sometime before. I know. I've felt like that too. There must be something here to take with us? I must not... Who forbids it? Leena... Can I have my clothes back? Can you forgive me? - There's nothing to apologize for. And nothing to forgive. I want you to believe that I feel sorry. Are you leaving? Yes. Can I kiss you? If you feel like it. You're not angry at me, are you? I asked you not to talk about it. When will we see again? Can I call you in the evening? Do not call me for a while now. Bye. Hello? Unfortunately she's not home right now. She's in the city, yes. She'll probably be back in the evening. You're welcome. You can't keep that up forever. You have to make a decision. You've been tormenting the poor boy for a week. I know. Everything just feels so dull. What's happened between you two? First you're like a pair of doves and then suddenly it's all kaput. A lovers' quarrel, huh? It's not that. I noticed something I should've noticed ages ago. Try to make sense of that, she isn't making any. Come to the school ball with us. Someone there might cheer you up. I doubt it. But I can still come. Good evening, Leena. - Good evening. I want to talk with you. Can you come with me? I'll walk you home. - Why not... - You wanted to talk with me? - Let's go somewhere quiet. Can you come to my place? No. Let's go somewhere else. Thanks for a nice evening. Bye. Bye. Can I have another one? It's past serving hours, sorry. I heard you had a nice evening. Yes, I did. What of it? If you're looking for a fight, you won't get one. But I'll talk if you stay calm. Fine. Let's stay calm then. What's come down between us? Are you upset about what happened back then? I'm not upset about that. I wanted it as well. Probably more than you did. Then I don't understand. I understood then... That you're not a man. You're a small boy - and all these years you've been looking for a mother in me. If you had been a man and taken me, even with force, as a woman... It would be different. But I won't look after you for the rest of my life. So you were looking for a man tonight? Not in the sense that you mean. I was seeing friends. I'm a normal young woman and I want to see people like me. I've been avoiding others for your sake. You forget the fact that you're my fiancee. You're wearing my ring as we speak. Not anymore. So you're divorcing me? That's right. Leena... I can't understand how we ended up in this situation. That shouldn't be difficult - if you could see that you're staring at your own misery. You wish to pull another person into it. You're selfish and you look up to your own sorry fate. You're a tragedian, and worst of all, you want it. You miss out on life. I reckon you'd be miserable if you were happy for a moment. It sounds contradictory, but it's true. Can't we really stay together? Leena, let's try one more time. I'd give anything. I wouldn't say it won't happen, but before that... Man up. Stop following me and spying on me. Goodbye, Antti. "Dear Leena... "When you receive this letter... "I will be gone." Hello? Yes. Oh, it's you. Is it necessary? If what you say is true it's fine by me. I'll be down in half an hour. It was Antti. I'll go see him. - Is that a good idea? He said he understood everything I told him last time. He said he wants to say goodbye. Right, then you'll fall for him again. If what he said was true, it's my obligation to go. After all, he's a boy I used to love. - And will love again. That's not impossible under certain circumstances. It made me so happy when you said that - you've figured out your life. I suppose I was too harsh on you the last time, but I was so upset. I'm glad you've worked it out. Tell me, what have you decided? Will you begin studying seriously? What I've decided is childishly simple. It's written down in a few short sentences in a letter - that waits for you on my desk. Friendly folks will probably give it to you once all is over. What do you mean? Once what's over? Everything. What I said on the phone is true, I've come up with a plan. And I want to say my goodbyes now. - I don't understand. What's the plan? To see you one last time, and then it's over, fini. A suicide. Antti will be gone. Don't be crazy. You can't be serious. I can't help being crazy. What else could I be? I take after my parents. Though you didn't believe in heredity. I don't believe you. You're acting tragic. You're mistaken. For once. I don't want to listen to you. I want to go home. This is our last meeting. And I haven't said my goodbyes. I want to kiss you once more. Let me go or I'll scream! You weren't always this reluctant. - Let me go! Good for you this will be the last time. Please, let me go! Go to hell you son of a hanged bitch! The court may be of the opinion I've been too extensive - but I think it's been absolutely necessary. Based on this story, - based on confidential discussions with the defendant, I've concluded - that the act has been committed, while in a responsible state, - nevertheless in an acute mentally disturbed state - that was triggered by the victim's deeply offensive remarks. We sentence the defendant Antti Kalervo Kajava - for a homicide committed in an acute mentally disturbed state - to ten years imprisonment. SUBTITLES: themagician @ KG
