The Coach Talk to each other, Jens. Go get him! That's it. Back in defense, boys. Final push. Come on! Niels. Niels, come here. Niels listen. Number 7, are you listening? Number 7, you can make him lob it. Okay? You can do it. Come on, Niels. Easy now. Alright! Yes! Well done! Yes! Hi. - Hi. Come on in. Good to see you. What's this? Just a couple of beers. Hi there. What's up? Guess who? Gosh, that's difficult. Hi. - Hi there. The best keeper in the world. Is it true you can save three balls at once? If you can do that I'll let you kiss me. Hey, not so fast. Do you love me? Yes. Even more than handball? Well, come on. Do you think we're playing Snog City? Great party. It's cool that you do this. We've been together three months today. Pretty good, eh? You can use my bedroom later. Seriously? Yes. Just say when. Promise me you'll win the cup. Otherwise we're through. What? You're so cute. I love you. Fuck. It's my dad. What? I'll be back in a minute. - What are you doing? Don't fall asleep now. No, don't go. Hi dad. Don't fall asleep. Don't, fall asleep. Niels. Niels? Are you sleeping? I have to go. Pernille? Pernille? Pernille? Pernille, where are you? Pernille? Niels, is that you? God, you scared me! Anything wrong? I can't find Pernille. Strange. Why don't you go back to bed? No. No, it's fine. I'll just go home. Seriously? She blowed you? - Yeah. You're taking the piss. - No. She was great at it. My dick is still blue. Lucky bastard. Hi, Niels. Thanks for yesterday. Have you slept it off? Thanks for, you know. The thing you did. What? I don't understand. The blowjob. Blowjob? Thanks for the blowjob. It was, good. I didn't give you a blowjob. What? Yes, you did. Didn't you? Have you been with someone else? Eh?! - No. I thought it was you. Answer me. Who was it? I thought it was you! How could you not tell? I don't know. I was drunk, and it was dark. She just left. There was no one else there, except for the coach. Idiot! Pernille. (Calling to) Hi, this is Pernille. Leave a message. More energy, Niels. Energy Niels! It's not women's handball. Good, Martin. Come on. One more time. Come on, Lars! More energy, Niels. Get those paws in the air. Go! Come on, Niels. Okay! That's enough. Get dressed. We have to be out in 15 minutes. Niels? I've got some tapes that I'd like us to look at. Come over to my place later. It'll just be you and me. I heard someone mention a championship this weekend. Take it easy until then. Get some sleep and eat well. - Yes, okay. The bus leaves at 9 am sharp. See you then. Bye. - Bye. Shut up for a second! Who'll fix the booze? Lars? No, I'm broke. Where are we going to stay? - Eh, Niels, where are we staying? Hallo! - Eh? Where are we staying? At a youth hostel. I hope they have some sexy chicks, who know how to suck it off. When Niels brings Pernille, then we'll take turns. What have you told them? - Hey relax! Niels? What was that all about? Eh? Hi, honey. - Hi. I've got some rolls in the oven. How about inviting Pernille? No, it's okay. I'll just call her tomorrow. Are you okay? Are you excited about the final? I'm sure you're going to win. Mom, I'm doing my homework. I'd like to finish it if it's okay. Sure. Of course. Hi. - Hi. You didn't turn up. No, I'm sorry. Something came up. I heard about you and Pernille. I'm sorry. I've got some German homework. German? Well, that's a really, exciting subject. On the other hand, we could also just go out and discuss the match. John, would you like a cup of coffee? No, Mom. Me and John are going out for a bit. Let me put some shoes on. Women are impossible to understand. You have to separate your feelings and your game. When you're Danish Champion, you can get all the girls you want. You know? Bon appetit, Champ. You know the party last Saturday. - Yes? Eat your food. There was someone in your room. Yes, you and Pernille. And you were really hammered. I, I think there was a man in there. A man? Who was it? He touched me. Are you trying to be funny? It's not funny, Niels. You don't think it's me. Do you? I don't get it. I thought we were friends. Haven't I done all sorts of things for you? Didn't I help you when you went to Oslo with the senior squad? Yes. I think you're very talented. You could be the best, Niels. The very best. Do you want to lose all that, because you got drunk and imagined things? No. - No! I let it get too far that night. I shouldn't have let you drink so much. When the alcohol goes in, the brain goes out. Are we friends? Yes. Eat up. Then we'll go and look at some new shoes for you. A Danish Champion can't walk around in those old slippers. Hi, this is Pernille. Leave a message. Listen, I don't want any mess in the bus. I'm not talking to anyone in particular. Lars! ♪ We're the boys from Høj and we'll bang all your bitches ♪ ♪ We're the boys from Høj we're doing it with style! ♪ ♪ some pussy again, some pussy again? ♪ ♪ When will I ever get some pussy again? ♪ One at a time. One at a time. Take it easy! Alright. Rooms. Come in here for a sec. Jens, Martin and Lars, go in room 2. Casper, Ole and Michael, room 3. The rest of you go in room 4. Niels, room 5. You get your own room. Yes! - Special keeper's privilege. Hey. - Hi. Are you enjoying the Royal Suite? Yeah. It's really cool. Thanks a lot. Could you mix us some Gatorade? Yeah, sure. I'm really chuffed with these shoes. I want you to feel comfortable. You know? Niels? Hi. Hi. It's me. Hello? Are you there? Hey. I just wanted to wish you good luck. It's tonight, right? Yes. - What time are you playing? At 7 pm. We're leaving at 5. What are you doing? Sofie and Trine are coming over. We're going to watch Sex and the City for the sixth time. I better go. - I love you. What did you say? I love you, Pernille. I love you too, Niels. I miss you so much. I'm sorry I didn't call earlier. It's okay. I was drunk, and, it was just something I dreamed. Want to meet up when I get back? Yes. Definitely. And don't forget to win that cup now. I promise. Have a good match. Way to go, Niels. You're the best! You're the best Niels! Come on, guys. Get your hands up. Come on. No! Talk to each other. Fall back! Focus. Come on now. Final push. Ten seconds, boys! Get your hands up. Yes! Yes! Yeah alright! Danish Champions! Who's the best? We're Danish Champions! - Yes, we are! Danish Champions. Oh, Niels. Niels.
