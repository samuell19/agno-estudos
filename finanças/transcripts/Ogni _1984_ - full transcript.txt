LENFILM FIRST CREATIVE UNION Singing: the Orthodox people are celebrating. Anticipation, nervousness, impatience. The Orthodox people are happy. Flying fast through the fields. Flying through the fields. The secret thought flies faster. The heart beats as if counting moments. Treacherous thoughts hover during the journey. And you whisper "Oh God, how how long it takes" During the evening, Nikoloi Anastas'evich Anan'ev, a young engineer. Realised once again that the anticipation of something incredible. Has been replaced in his soul by a dull melancholy. The town to which he has travelled for a meeting of Engineers was just like tens of other towns. Through which the great railways were being build. Evening. A celebration in the well-groomed townspark. All the Ladies are adorable tonight. Nonsense. It's all just lighting effects. How well it fits: the train rushes into new times. It doesn't fit well at all, damn it. This is all tasteless rubbish. Would you be so kind as to remember this is Glinka's song. And yet it is lies and nonsense. The words may not be too precise but the music awakens the senses. The music is lies too. Still lies. This young man does not agree with you at all. That's not true. The young man is thinking about something alltogether different. Are you able to guess what strangers think about? Why not. I will definitely guess right. You are not from these parts. You are from St Peterburg. You've come for the opening of the new railways. New railways are opened by generals I went to the Caucases for a holiday and got delayed here for two days. Due to highly personal circumstances. Not at all. The circumstances are career-related. So you think you are here and will be bored for two days. Considering getting together with some woman. You rude bear. But I am right. Aren't I? For example with this woman here. Or maybe this one. Because she is younger and prettier. That is what the young man is thinking about. Agree with me! Or maybe with this one. That is my wife. Take your words back or you will be challenged to a duel. I did not know, sorry. Of course I don't care, but I am prepared to fight for the truth. Shhh.. No, it is not just the lighting. Tonight the ladies are indeed charming and intelligent. Because they see our great deeds, our enormous enterprise. Just look at this. Just look at that mound. It is like a whole Monte Blanc. Costs a million. The million you earn as profit and here are lying human bones Russian bones. You young men don't see the essence, the beauty. The beauty of life and great deeds. Our future is in these lights. Our hope. It is pleasant to look at the work on your own hands Russians have just one hope. To win two hundred thousand. Allow me. These lights make me think of something long dead. That lived thousands of years ago. Like a phillistine settlement. As though some clan of the Old Testament settled down and waits for dawn. To complete the illusion just pipe music is missing. And ethiopian calls of the watch-men. Hear that? There's the pipe. No thats the air brake. It screams like a cow locked in a shed. Like a pipe. A pipe waking the dead. We are building a railway. But in a thousand years or two. Not even dust will remain of us or this mound. Farewell, Gentlemen. I must be off. Sir? You should forget these thoughts Tatiana DOGILEVA. Evgeni LEONOV-GLADISHEV Vladislav STRZHEL'CHIK. Georgy BURKOV. In the film. LIGHTS Based on stories by A.P. CHEKHOV. Script: Aleksandr CHERVINSKY. Production: Solomon Shuster. Operator-producer: Dmitry DOLININ. Artistic Producer: Georgy KROPACHEV. Composer: Boris TISHENKO. Sound engineer: Boris ANDREEV. On the deserted shore he stood, full of great thoughts Ivan Korol'kov was here, 16th may. Nineteen-... not clear which year. Most people when left alone become certain they will perish. So they hurry to leave a trace after themselves. Would you like one? Listen. You don't happen to be Anan'ev? Yes, I am Anan'ev. You don't recognise me. No. Natal'ya Stepanovna. Little Kitten. Yes. It is me. My God. How many years have passed. Ten? Nine. Nine. You recognised me with difficulty? You don't have to reply. Amazing that you recognised me. You had so many suitors. God, I did not sleep at night, wrote poetry. You did not notice me at all. I was so in love with you. I really did notice you. I remember everything. If only you knew. How I suffered. Sometimes in the evenings you would sit on a bench in the town park. Pale, fragile, light. Us students would gather around you and observe adoringly. You were our ideal. Alas! I am no longer that "little kitten" But I am terribly happy to see you. Terribly. Do you remember, Natalya Stepanovna. How once in the garden I gave you a bouquet. With a note. You read the note and looked very puzzled. No, I do not remember that. I remember how you wanted a duel with Florens because of me. What has past is past. Now my turn has come. To look at you from below. I recognised you immediately. And you didn't recognise me. I noticed you at once I've been looking at you the whole time. No, you were looking at the young students. You still have the same ideals. Where do you live now? In St Petersburg I've qualified to become an engineer. And now build endless pointless railways. How good it is. What are the chances of our meeting. I spoke to your husband by chance earlier. Yes I am married. I got married two years after finishing my degree. He works in a bank. Or in an insurance company I don't even know for sure. You must have grand plans for life. Plans? Must be my city-type face misleading you. What plans are you talking about? Well.. You are building the railway. In a hundred years kind people will build factories, school and hospitals here. It is all nonsense. Serving society is a lie. I don't do anything at work. My conscience sleeps. Ideals? I don't have any ideals. None. That is where he is. Allow me to continue our discussion. You have wound him up and run away, now he won't leave me in peace. You haven't wound me up but rather caused my indignation. We have received higher education and now must bear responsibility. Not the heart but the mind tell you that. Life is pointless. Bear in mind, the one who thinks everything is pointless is indifferent. To the nature and concept of Sin. Your thought denies the value of each human being. It is all lies. The truth is that you would like a drink. To sit down and talk, because you love to talk. Naturally I am happy to meet an educated man. My surname is Populatti. Just listen to how he pronounces his surname. It is famous in the city. - he is a millionnaire. My surname means nothing and you don't need it. Don't listen to him - I don't own any millions. You know what will happen soon and yearn for it. That is the main truth. Let us go Mr Anan'ev and speak philosophically. I must ask you to forgive me, Gentlemen I need to get up early tomorrow. We were planning to have a drink of beer with you. Or wine. I don't drink. And we do drink! We all drink here. In that there is the main truth. That is the main truth. Of course it is the truth. Are you mad? Why are you barking? We are honest people! The dog barks, the wind carries it off. If I was a man I would have hit him Nikolai Anastas'evich! Yes. Let us go to mine and have tea. With pleasure. Well... little pleasure lies in it. But according to your philosophy it does not matter whether you drink tea or not. Whether you go or don't go. So let us go. Over there are my lights. Your Honour. For Chirsts sake, accept the containers. If the railroad ordered these containers, it must accept them. We've been travelling around for two days, the horses are hungry. Understand, you fool, I don't know who ordered the containers I don't know. Who knows, your honour. No-one knows. He knows. Holy Father. Holy Father, accept the containers for Christ's sake. The horses haven't eaten for two days. That is none of our concern, dear one. Oh look, how sweet! How wise it all is - must be lovely to pray and travel. Travel where? Where your eyes lead you. Your Honour, accept the containers. Get out, I tell you! Who are the containers from? Your honour. Please help: the railway ordered containers, no point taking them back. Who are the containers from? From Nikitin. Then go to Chalisev I tell you, go to Chalisev and wait for him. Come on. Your honour, we spent all of yesterday looking for Chalisev. We were told he has gone to Dimkov region. Your Honour! Please take pity on us, accept the containers! How well you took the right decision immediately I spent last night with this Chalisev. Playing cards. He is probably still sitting there now. If ten years ago.. Nine years. Yes, nine. If there had been a duel. My whole life, and probably yours would have taken a very different direction. If I had killed this Florens. God be with you. What became of Florens? He died. Of cholera. I don't know anything about anyone. As though a hundred years have passed. Yes... The streets are filled with new young women, students alien to me. No-one i recognise. Except you. Tell me please, Little Kitten, which fly was has the whole female gender been bitten by? In this town they all used to be so honourable with strict morals. And now? One young woman ran away with an Officer, another with an actor. And so on and so forth. A whole epidemic! Could it be the influence of the railway? Yes. All they say is true. It was my cousin that left her husband for an actor Sonya. Of course it is not good, each person should bear sorrow. That which has been given to him by fate. But circumstances can be stronger than human beings. That's true, but what circumstances could give birth to a whole epidemic? Well... it's all very simple. Intelligent women have no place here. Not everyone can live just on goals and ideals like men. We must marry. But who is there to marry? You boys finish your degree and travel away. To universities. To never return to your hometown. Yes. The girls remain. Who can they marry then? So they marry God knows who. Various businessmen. Which are only capable of drinking and creating scandals in the club. Yes, Nikolai Anastas'evich, women are drinking more often. Than you think. If all that is so, why marry? Everyone is laughing at Sonya. Because she ran away, and with an actor. But if they could look into her soul they would not laugh Nikolai Anastas'evich, if I am creating doom. If you are tired please tell me. If you are tired then go. We are all tired. Of slavery, of pretence. Do you have children? I had a boy, he lived for a week and died. It seems my husband is home. Well, then. Come to challenge me to a duel for you again. So she lied to you, and you believed her! Firstly, it was not in the big Club, but in the little one Jupiter, you are angry, so you are wrong. Please tell me, may I spend the night at yours? What sort of question is that? It's not that you may spend the night, you should do it. Would you like beer or wine? Pardon! You? Turns out Natalya and I are old friends. My childhood took place in this town. And your wife and I... Women pale in the absence of male company. Whereas men without women become stupider. And become pessimistic. And lie about clever things. The train rushes through the fields... Actually, it is great you came to visit us. I think any truth is better than constant deceit. For example. A man finds out about his wife's infidelity. But takes his time. Invents a thousand excuses. Ends up borrowing money from her lover. Do you speak of an aquaintance of yours? About a close friend who I love dearly and pity. I am prepared to give my life for him. Because I am prepared to give my stupid life away for friendship and truth. To leave my two children orphans. Two children! A boy and a girl. The boy has a lovely face, looks like me. Remarkably talented he is. I have a photo somewhere. Leave it. You confuse everything. The main thing in life is not children. It's normal for a rich man not to have money on him. Tomorrow I must give the organiser a sum collected for the library workers. I haven't yet collected the money from all the participants and don't have cash on me. But you must pay before the bank opens. So what do you suggest I do? You know me I am prepared to give away everything. But I just have nothing to give! Nothing! As for you, Sir Pessimist, would you like to take part? How much is needed? Would you like to lend some money or give some? I do not mind 10 roubles is enough? Very much so. They will be stolen anywayy. Or if they are not stolen, who needs this library? Throw the money here! Throw! The workers today are no different to those we knew. When there were no plays and improvements for them. That is the truth. I am giving in my share. That is how it should be done. I will come up and give you a form. Your signature is needed. Sign for me yourself. You are a noble man. Especially as your ideas.. That's enough philosophy. Time for bed. Come on. Let's go have some tea, don't hang on to me like that. I brew great tea. Well, farewell, Natalya Stepanovna. Yes. Don't see me off especially as it seems that I will need to give them the signature after all. You are staying with me. It is likely we will never see each other again. Thank you. Little Kitten, Dearest. Time will pass and nothing will be left of this town, of these people. Of me and all my thoughts. And of you with your sorrow there will not even be dust left. It's all nonsense. Do not torture yourself. But I do not hear your wife's opinion. Why is she always silent? She is silent because she knows her own opinion well. God damn it. Secret thoughts fly faster. Would you like to proceed with me to the bar? I think I may have lost my way. Lost in my own town. Tell me is it possible to find a horse and carriage here? There are no cabbies here. And you should not have given him the money. He talks too much and always lies. In his financial records book there is a page: Charity spending. And another page: for physiological needs. But he does not have physiological needs. He lies to the whole town when he says he lives with Kostovich. Hey listen, if you didn't give him your last few coins lets go to the bar? I am terribly tired. I do not care who Sir Populaki lives with. Can't you understand I don't drink! Stop it, you are very interested. A dark night of loneliness, a damsel in distress. Just the cossacks with their swords are missing. Tell me, how do I find the hotel. I wish you luck. When will all this be over. Oh God. Oh God, this is unbearable. You can see I bear my suffering in silence. But understand, I want to live Nikolai Anastas'evich. What is it? I cannot bear it anymore. I do not have any strength left. Forgive me, I am going to my Mothers. Walk me there, for God's sake. Walk there with me. What has happened? I am so unhappy. Have pity on me I do not know how to deal with tears and comfort. I can't bear it anymore. I must go to my Mother. Little Kitten, come to your senses. Where are you going to go? There are no cabbies. Then I will walk. Life is so... What sort of life is this? I beg you, do not cry. I am not crying anymore. No I can see you are crying. I am as if in a deep hole, if only I could live for a minute. Like others are living. Little Kitten. Calm down, who lives in happiness? Who have you seen that is happy? I have lost shame to the extent of leaving my husband at night in front of another man. Like some wanton... I do not know how to comfort. I never understood how people can be comforted. Why drag yourself all across town at night. Why? Is your husband worth that? No. You must just laugh at him I will laugh with you. Yes. Yes of course. Of course I will return to my husband, Nikolai Anastas'evich. You go in peace. It's just that I am as lonely as the moon in the sky. You reminded me of the past. So I couldn't take it anymore. Why would I go to my Mother? As if that will make me happier. No it will not. I must return. I need to return. Do not see me off. No I will definitely take you home. Little Kitten! Oh my God. God forgive me for everything. God help me. Let's go, you are a clever girl. God if you can hear me.. I assure you he does not hear you, there is no God. Silence! Do not punish yourself. God is not there. Each person completely dissappears when they die. Look at yourself subjectively, Darling. Little Kitten. You are so pretty in your lovely dress. Standing on dirty earth by an iron box. An iron box with wheels built to deliver materials to journalists and photographers. It is funny, ridiculous and stupid! Nikolai Anastas'evich. I am a bad woman. You are a lovely woman and I like you very much I am a bad woman I do not love my husband. Once I was prepared to be unfaithful to him. He knows about it but does not let me leave him. If I leave he threatens to return me with aid of the police. I can't refuse his money and my family and I depend on him. This fact gives him pleasure. He hasn't even stopped talking to that man. Little Kitten, why are you crying. In life everything must be experienced. Marriage, the sweetness of a first infidelity. Because all these things are just moments in eternity and will vanish without trace. The world is as it is and not how we would like to see it. But are you are a good man. You don't believe it yourself. In what you are saying. Yes... yes. Maybe we are good people, but useless. We may be at the forefront but there is no hope for us. I used to dream of St Petersburg. Of great deeds. But now I am sure these were all illusions and lies. All is nonsense. You, Kitten, ask of yourself and others that which does not exist. Your Honour. What do you want? Your Honour? For Christs sake, accept the containers. What would I use your containers for. Can I wear them on my head? Take pity on me. Leave me alone. For three days I have been travelling and travelling... Back and forth. None wants to accept them. The horses are hungry. Why do you say these terrible things? Because I cannot put anything in order. I am a man, yet I am powerless. You think only of yourself. Love will come, and you will flourish and live like all the others. If I were you, I would have found seven lovers. Seven? One for each day of the week. One I would call monday, another tuesday, wednesday. And so on. Farewell. This time farewell for good: I leave tomorrow. I won't go back to him. No, not for anything. Even if I was shot with a cannon. I will go to my mother. Here is a cabbie! Cabbie! That's it, Nikolai Anastas'evich, I have decided. Thank you, I will never forget your help. Don't speak of yourself like you did any more! That is what I think. Then don't think like that in future. Do you hear me, don't you dare think like that. I think I will ride with you as far as the hotel. Well.. It is our town which has this effect on you. You are young and handsome. A free man. You saved me just now. If it was not for you I would have returned to him. I would have agreed to compromise again, and now I will not. Thank you. Stop. Stop, I say! Natalya Stepanovna, let us walk. We will part soon. And I have not said all I must say to you. Have a rouble. Thank you, Sir. I have to tell you. I must tell you, Natasha. I was fully honest with you. Life has no meaning for me. What do you want? Do you want me to run away with you? I will take you away from this hole. Make you happy. Come with me, Darling. Do not. Don't, Nikolai Anastas'evich. Kitten. You know our meeting was no accident. You are my first love. And who knows. Maybe we will save each other. No, don't Nikolai Anastas'evich, Kolya! Natasha, I am perishing. Only you can save me. I will take you away. I won't let you go anywhere. That is it. Tomorrow we will leave. Tomorrow, can you hear me. In fact today, as tomorrow has already come, Kitten I cannot live without you. I am so happy I can touch you Natasha! Come with me. This way. Horses! No. It has to be done. I know what to do. I cannot live without you. I love you. I know you will save me. You, and only you, can save me. Do not answer me. But I know I love you. That you mean to me more than anything. How beautiful. It is that you are here. That you are with me. Come to me! Yes... You have been flying long enough! I love you. I love you. Why are you laughing? Look: thoughts of demise. Did you bring it with you? Already you are laughing at me. No. I am laughing because I love you. When I hear your voice my heart is as though put in a draught. Your Honour. Wake up! What time is it? It is six. You shouted terribly in your sleep. You are a fool after all, better bring some vodka. Why are you standing still, you idiot. Firstly, it is still early. Everyone is asleep. Secondly, I was ordered not to give you any. Well, that is stupid. Devil take you all. At least bring some soup. There is some here. Listen to me, Dear, they are inedible. I did not order soup with cockroaches. I did not put the cockroach there. It got in by itself. Do not worry yourself, cockroaches do not bite. Fool! What? They don't bite. Anan'ev, open the door! Anan'ev open the door, I know you are here. The storage-houses have burned down, congratulations. Populatti will get even richer. This whole town doesn't have a portion of decent soup. Do you see the connection? How can I help you? I would like a drink, you have anything? I come to you simply as a comrade. Here you are. Merci. I am vanishing. The truth is that no-one fully sees connections. No-one. Nor you or me, even though we all read newspapers. Read what is going on in Siberia I've read it. In Greece. In England what will they think about it? Greece and Serbia will rise France won't bear it, nor will the Germans Spain will rebel about the Caroline islands. And so on and so forth. You won't even have time to gasp while all of Europe is turned upside down. You may not care. Whether grass grows or not, but I will have to fight. Though, I spit on it all with great pleasure. Kolya, do you love me? You love me? I am so happy! Tomorrow we will leave for the Caucases? And then St Petersburg? I'll collect your things now. Do not worry about my husband, Kolya. We will get divorsed. You were right, I will not agree to any compromises. Oh my, look what I found in your things! Look how much money! We are rich! We are rich and free, you love me don't you? These six hundred must last me untill Christmas by the way. Untill Christmas? You are careless, how can you throw a new overcoat on the floor like that! My beloved careless one. I will pack it too? Kolya! Look, your suitcase! It is a parallelepiped in shape. Which shape? A good shape. My beloved. You love me, yes? I am so happy. There is nowhere to go here, except the cemetary. We will travel. And then live and work togehter. Because all the evil comes from idleness and emptiness in the soul. I too, will work. I will be useful to you, Kolya. What can you do? Nothing. I have no skills. My father was a military man, taught me to pontificate. Tell me, if you love me I love you, I am terribly tired. You are tired. Just a minute. Sleep, my dear, let me wrap you up. Darling, my beloved. You know, when I was sitting on the park bench and you were with all the other boys back then. Your face was just as sad, you have not changed at all. You are the same kind and clever boy as then. You are not a grown up. You are just pretending. Ridiculous for you to come to your mother at such a time. Just do not look at me like that. How? As though I have done something wrong. No. No, Dearest. You have done nothing wrong. When will we meet? They met exactly at noon in the townspark. By our summer house. At noon. At noon. And we will leave. We will leave. You, dog, understand nothing. What time is it? Quarter past one. You did not ask me to wake you. If a lady comes to ask for me, say I am not there. I understand. If you could understand my psychology. Bite me! What is it there? A man is arguing with a dog, drunkard. I am king of the species. No, you are mistaken, I am a hypocrite. A Judas. Again I have informed and betrayed. Anan'ev, come to us! Just a minute, gentlemen. Please do not move. Take me to the office and bring something fast I need to travel. Here, Sir. We are fated to have some beer together. Or wine? I thought we would meet, all our visitors have breakfast here. Sit with me. Thank you. I tired you out with my chatter last night. Time will pass and you will bore young men just like me. In me, you can see yourself in twenty or thirty years. There are few intelligent people and invisible threads connect them. There are idiots around us, don't you agree? Especially amongst women there are many fools. They are so used to it they don't even understand. They go to theaters, read thick books and yet are evil and immoral. This morning I was informed that my wife has a lover. Notice, when russians meet they only speak of high philosophy and women. Imagine my position: I am unhappy and a source of amusement. Family values are scorned. Now, as an honourable man and citizen I must kill my wife, you and then myself. An hour ago I was in an arms shop and was offered a gun of the "Smith and Wesson" calibre. A very accurate and powerful weapon. You, Sir, constantly speak of death, so here it is... So here... turns out you are a triumphant young man. Where as I am one flattened by life. If we are to speak seriously, what news does your new generation have? You speak of everyones demise. You shout of lack of ideals. And so on. But all that we have already seen. It was there twenty and thirty years ago. All these words have been said more than once. If you had acquired the freedom of which you speak so much you would not know what to do with it. You would have used it for accusing each other of insignificance. And love for money. To frighten society by informing it of its lack of science, literature, everything. Frightening Society means taking away its vigour. How old are you. Twenty-five. You are young. God has given you a strong russian brain with inclings of talent. You fill it with thoughts of devaluation of life and post-mortal twilight. Where was I now? You were telling me about the gun I did not buy the "Smith and Wesson" Imagine, it costs forty-five roubles, too much for me I was offered a cheaper duel gun of the "Mortimer" system. To challenge you to a duel... Would be too much of an honour, I thought. Scoundrels like you are killed like dogs. That is why I decided to kill you, but not her or myself. Why do you look at me like that? Are you late getting somewhere? Home. To St Petersburg. Oh yes, to the Caucases. When I kill you, I will be arrested. My arrest will allow me to reveal to society at the trial the immorality of her behaviour. If, however, I kill myself. My wife, typically of her lying nature will accuse me of everything. That is why I will kill only you. And go to prison. So this will be the result of all my works? The shop assistant offered me a british gun. They have just received it. But then I remembered yesterdays conversation with you. As though everything is pointless, because we will all die eventually. So I thought. If the Judge and Jury were to use the same logic, they would all live with other men's wives. They will be calmer with one less husband living in Russia. Not so simple, Sir, I thought. It is not wise to go to exile in Sahalin because of some pig. If I go to prison my wife will be able to marry again. Cheat on a second husband. She will be triumphant. No! To the devil with world melancholy and post-mortal gloom. Yes.. You look as if you have convinsed me of something. My Dear, it is impossible to convinse you of anything. You can reach enlightenment only through personal experience and suffering. You despise life because you fear only your own death. A real thinker suffers and fears for all people. I have come to the only correct and wise decision. She will remain alive, I do not kill myself. You... I also do not kill. I will punish her by despising her. But will not divorce her. Never. Never. And the gun? Gun are too expensive. But I felt ashamed that the shop assistant was wasting his time on me, so I bought this. Just eight roubles. What is that? It is a net for catching quails. You are so lucky not to live in the country. Mr Anan'ev. Just a moment. Just a moment. Have a great journey. You honour, for Christs sake! Accept the containers! The horses are hungry. Sir General! Anan'ev! You... what? Why are you here? Chalisev! What do you want? Accept the containers. What? Accept the containers from that man. Sure, later Natasha! Kolya! Kolya, you came! You came, my darling! Natasha, forgive me! Don't. It's ok, you have come. I am going mad. Why are you like that, Kolya. It is not because of you, but me I cannot take you away. Everything has turned on it's head I have no prejudice, no morality, no heart. I have nothing. Forgive me. Forgive me, I was pretending to be a wise man. I lied to you that I loved you. But I cannot forget your face. Forgive me, Natasha. Why do you torture yourself like that. Kolya, it is wonderful that you have come. Do not worry about me, I knew nothing further would come of us. Because, why do you need me, you have such a great future ahead. What future? What future can there be now? What future can there be now? It's ok, you have a wonderful future. You will build thousands of roads. Years will pass and you will forget me. You will be happy and loved. Because you are an amazing person, Kolya. I am the most pitiful and ordinary person. No... no. How good it is that you are crying, Kolya. You are a great person, Kolya. Oh God, how good it is that I met you. How happy I am to have met you Natasha. Tell me, what should I do? God being merciful, everything will sort itself out. It will all be ok. Look, Kolya! You were right. What a shame it is that all these people will die one day. But never mind, God grant us everything will be ok. God will help us. All will be well. There was laughter in the crowd. Anan'ev was no longer crying. Like everyone, he was watching, listening to music. And it seemed that the most frightening and the hardest things are in the past. Nothing is simple in this world. In a few hours, he left this town forever. Anan'ev - Evgeni LEONOV-GLADISHEV. Little Kitten - Tat'yana DOGILEVA. Kitten's husband: Vladislav STRZHEL'CHIK. Husband's friend: Georgy BURKOV.
