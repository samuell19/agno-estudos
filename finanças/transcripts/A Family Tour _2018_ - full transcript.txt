The windy season has arrived. Yue Yue has come, a bit of a sudden. It feels rather strange. Did Mum first see me the same way back then? Leaves on the trees rustle in the wind. Memories cut across dreams and play with time. When I close my eyes, I can smell my father as he used to hold me. The smell of soap on him is distinctive. "Yang Shu's diary" "Temporary stay for Hong Kong and Macau residents" "Passport number" "Taiwan Visa" Hello. We really can't do that. Can we follow the itinerary of your tour group and meet the old lady in Taiwan? Please understand our situation, Ms. Peng. Can you please make an exception? Ms. Peng said, we should go back to China and join the tour there. We should leave with the group from China and go back with them. That would definitely work. But you can't. I asked if we could follow their itinerary and meet Mum in Taiwan. She said that might be possible. What do you think? It sounds strange. The travel agency didn't say anything. They just asked me to see the authorities at the Immigration Bureau. I'm worried all the same. I'm sure they'll mention you both tomorrow, but I'll stick to my story and tell them I'm going to Taiwan for sightseeing. You are in Hong Kong and have nothing to do with my trip. In such case, Mum, can you let me know the situation as soon as you finish meeting with them tomorrow? Alright, that's it for now. - Talk soon. - Daddy, look at my beanpod. What is it? Shall we take a photo and send it to Mummy? Taiwan Arrival Card. Anyone? Do Chinese nationals need to fill it? - Yes. Here you are. - Thank you. Do you need an Arrival Card? - One for me please! Thank you. - No problem. Anyone needs a Taiwan Arrival Card? Scissors, paper, stone. Dear passengers, we are descending onto Kaohsiung Airport. Please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts. Our estimated time of arrival is 3:30 p.m. local time. Director Yang Shu! Director Yang Shu! The reporters are already here. Please get ready. Thank you. This year, we're very pleased to feature Yang Shu as our Director In Focus, in particular to show "The Mother of One Recluse" which she made 5 years ago. I believe it's the main goal of this year's festival to introduce to you Chinese independent filmmakers like her. It's difficult for our Taiwan filmmakers to understand their courage in confronting politics. I suppose what you call politics is really a personal choice. I suppose what you call politics most important kind of politics, especially in a country without civil rights. Perhaps Taiwanese audience will see in my film a mother's situation This is the purpose of my film. Excuse me, Director. Your husband and son have checked into the hotel. You mother will arrive at 8 o'clock. Thank you. The film was made 5 years ago. Perhaps it's the best time to watch and discuss it again today. Director Yang, may I ask... Since you've lived in exile in Hong Kong for 5 years now, how do you feel about Hong Kong? Any thoughts on your future projects? Hong Kong is my home now. I'm planning to make a feature about a family in the midst of the Umbrella Movement. Thank you. All the best. Thank you for helping me with my Taiwan visa. That's our job. Good luck with everything. Thank you. Thank you. In his short film, he stated his nationality is Chinese for as many as 7 times and bowed at 90 degrees repeatedly. He denied his alleged pro-independence stance, and said there was only one China... Must you do the change now? This has provoked anger among netizens and intense attention from political figures. Below is the full text of Dr. Lin's statement. Hi, I'm "Dr. Happiness" Lin Hua Chung. I apologise. I've been proud of myself being a Chinese. We belong to the same China on both sides of the Straits. I've always kept this belief firmly in my heart. I still praise myself that I can be a proper Chinese. Good evening. Come on, let's get off first. Come on, this way. Yes, hurry up. Breakfast at 6:30 tomorrow. Mum. You had your hair cut short. You look even thinner than on our internet chats. Hi, Mr. Cheung. How are you? This must be Ms. Yang. We've got a slight problem with the rooms. It'll take about an hour to sort out. Madam Chen needs to come with me. Don't walk too fast. You can meet again in an hour, alright? Let's go. Just a little while, okay? Take it easy. Where are you going? Come take the lift. You'll meet again in an hour, okay? You shouldn't get in with us. Let them get out first. Come on, squeeze in. - Get in. - Thank you. Press the button. Hey! I dreamt that Dad and Mum were walking in front. They kept walking. I tried to call out to them but I couldn't. How come... Mum looks even thinner in real life? Didn't I tell you? She's using her walking stick again. You didn't tell me that. But now you see each other, don't you? Yes, but I don't know what to say to her. Silly thing. This is Taiwan. We can say anything we want. Mum's room number. "Formosa Film Festival" Hey. You are...? Where are you going? You can't take any criticism. You just took off. You wouldn't even take a shower. All you do is play with your phone. How often do we travel? Wrong room. Here you are. So this is the film. Haven't you made any film after this one? Mum, my life has been rather chaotic these 5 years. Mine has been rather quiet these 5 years. Since I can't go back, I spend a lot of time every year renewing my residency in Hong Kong. On several occasions, I almost had to go elsewhere. I have to teach for a living. Then we had Yue Yue. He'll be 4 this year. The doctor told me to have the operation as soon as I return. I've got all my medication with me. Why didn't you tell me? It was difficult to explain online. Good evening, Ms. Yang, Madam Chen. Sorry to disturb you. I've come to confirm a few things with you. The arrangement with your family is unusual. I'm sure you understand. The Immigration Bureau has communicated with us about Madam Chen's travel. You don't need me to tell you this. Ms. Yang, your husband, Mr. Cheung isn't around? He's nice and very meticulous. He's been in contact with us. He has made very good arrangements. Please relay to him what I'm going to say. You see tourism is a tough business. A while ago, restrictions were imposed on travel agencies bringing tours to Taiwan. Our business has plunged. There's nothing we ordinary people can do, is there? I don't want to offend our customers. So I've come to confirm our agreement with you. Ms. Yang, the three of you will turn up at the tourist spots. No problem at all. But please keep a low profile. Don't arouse the curiosity of others. And don't make them think we're taking special care of you. Let's make life easy for each other. Ms. Peng, I think... Help me unpack. Come on. Of course we understand. No problem. This is all for the best. Thank you. I'm glad you understand. We'll work things out together. Wonderful. Thank you. Then I'll see you around. Thank you. Madam Chen, please make sure you don't disappear. Don't jump ship. No, I won't. All your papers are with me. You see I've got a name list. I take roll call every day. Not one will be left behind. Having your situation as such, I have to report back every day. Please co-operate. Thank you. Ms. Peng, one moment please. Please accept this small token of gratitude. You're too kind. We're giving you too much trouble. Thank you! Don't mention it. Thank you! Ms. Yang, I'm actually a film fanatic. I'd go see yours if I didn't have to be with the tour. Well, goodnight. I'll get going. Bye. Goodbye. Mum. Mum, why did you talk to her like that? What's the matter? You really are like those Hong Kong people now. This is for you to keep. I recorded it 5 years ago when the police came to our home. Your husband had a criminal record about 30 years ago. Did he get on well with Yang Shu? They got on well, didn't they? Your daughter's anti-society and anti-government mentality was influenced by her family... What is it? Are you okay? Mum gave you this? Come on. Grandma wanna take a photo of you, alright? Be good. Come on. Be a good boy. 15 minutes more. We'll leave very soon. The bus is coming. Hey, you over there. 15 minutes more. Use the bathroom now if you need to. Eat up if you're still hungry. Come over here, Yue Yue. No! I'll go take a few more photos of Yue Yue. Get my bag later. Mum can't eat this. Chen Chu Hong. Zhang Xiao Yi. Nie Zheng Ping. Yin Hong Ji. Yin Li Jun. Chen Xiao Lin. Yes. What is it now? Set off! - It's fine. - This is crap service! - It's sorted. - I'm going to file a complaint. Ok. Let's get in. Thanks. Let's go. "Have you arranged a meeting with the actors?" Daddy, why don't we take the bus with Grandma? We're playing a game. Don't you remember? I remember. We can't let people find out we're a family. Yes, you'll get candies only if you can keep the secret, okay? Where are you from? I'm from Hong Kong. I was born in Sichuan, but my family originated from the Northeast. What a coincidence! My father was from the Northeast. Do you still live there? Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a good place. Shoppers' paradise. Now they also have one-belt-one-road, right? We'll take a detour. If the wind stops blowing, the clouds will dance, the birds will be clueless, and you will close your eyes, relax your shoulders and your arms. Well, there's a slight problem with the front door. Come over here. Be careful. Quick. We don't have much time. Come on! Let Grandma hold you. No. Just one hug. Be a good boy. Just one hug. You're running so fast! I've watched him grow up over the internet. We talked online every day, but he doesn't know me in person. No. Excuse me. Would you please take a photo for us? Sure. Here, open this. I see. Got it. What background do you want? - Do you want the fish? - Yes, please. I'll take it from here. Kaming. Zhang Xiao Yi, move over. Thank you. Move closer. Look at me. No. 1... 2...3... No. One more. - No. - 1... 2...3. Smile. Good. Thank you. Excuse me, my father wants to ask if... You are related to her. So you... No, they're children of my friend. They live here. Thank you. Sorry to intrude. Children of a friend. He's too worried to accept the role. It's understandable. Who isn't worried with all that's going on in China? We've got "umbrella" elements in the film. Of course it's sensitive. I see. He said he supports "the umbrella" and although he's pulled out, he supports us in spirit. Just that he won't take the role. But he recommended someone else. That person is in Taiwan. Shall I ask him to come meet us in Hong Kong? Where in Taiwan? Kaohsiung. I'm in Kaohsiung. I can meet now. It isn't that urgent. We've still got time. Please send his contact to me. Bye. What do you think if Mum doesn't go back to China? If we buy her a transit ticket to another country, she can enter with her passport. She can apply for a medical visa and have her operation in a private hospital. If that doesn't work, she can just stay home and avoid going out. Would that work? I think it would. Excuse me, group tickets please. Thank you. Two adults and one child. Aren't you with the tour? Oh, you are travelling with the Individual Visitor's visa. Let's take a photo. Come on, Yue Yue. I'll look for Mum. Kaming. You take a photo of him. I'll get Mum. Come over here. Let's look at the next set of wax figures. They show missionaries giving Taiwan people free medical care to spread Christianity. This handsome blonde guy was the first missionary to Taiwan, James L. Maxwell. A big round of applause for him. He came in 1865... that was 152 years ago. You can take photos with him, but don't touch him, or he'll come find you at night. Ms. Peng, when will we go to Taipei? You have to ask him about this. Pai! Pai! - Who actually made the arrangement? - Ask him. Can I help you? My father has been asking two questions. First, when will we go to Taipei Youth Park? Take a look. You fell asleep? Will we go to the Veteran Military Dependents' Village? Please make arrangements for that if possible. But I don't decide on the itinerary. Then who does? Please give me some time to find out for you. What is the itinerary like from now on? Give me one second. Let me find out. Take some photos first What is this? The West Graveyard. Your father's grave will be moved there. Why must it be moved? The government is building a road there. We have no choice. That's outrageous! The compensation they gave was not bad. This isn't about money, is it? What a good son you have! He can't hear. I see. He's hard of hearing. He had a stroke. He can't hear properly. He isn't well. Your father is pretty weak. Why did you still take him to travel? He insisted. He's been telling me to ask you for a favour. My grandfather came to Taiwan with the Nationalist Party in 1949. Meaning he left before my father was born. Soon after my grandfather was executed in Taipei... by the Nationalist Party. We've come on this tour, hoping to see the places where my grandfather lived. The tour guide doesn't want to take us anywhere and she doesn't let us go on our own. It seems you have relatives in Taiwan. May I trouble you to ask your relatives... to take us to some of those places at night? Okay. Thank you. They will help. They will help. Mum. I've been meaning to say sorry to you. Things aren't that bad now. You've been running around since you were little. I always have no idea where you are. Now we chat online every month. At least I've learnt a bit more about your life. But I can't give you any help at home. Oh yes! Our house will be demolished. You haven't said anything about that. There was no use telling you. G8 Summit will be held the year after next. Zigong City is one of the venues. Many new roads will be built. Our house falls into the planning zone. The compensation policy... is quite reasonable though. The property developers are quite considerate Think of it as our contribution to the country. It's not about the compensation, is it? Let it be. There's nothing we can do. How can that be? You really think you're a Hong Konger? That has nothing to do with whether I'm a Hong Konger or not Whether we move or not It's my sole decision and responsibility. Don't you think so? Mummy. You've got Mum's pen recorder, right? Yes I have. She gave it to me as a channel to reproach me? I just apologized to her. Daddy, I want to listen. You've seen films in the festival? Yes. Are you here for the festival? - Sort of. - I see. Is he a film director? Is he a film director? I recognise you. What is your film called? That one about the officials going to the old lady's home. Am I right? But I don't like it. It's boring. All those long shots. You've got a film in this year's festival, right? Something about a mother. Well, I don't have time to watch it. Then don't. But I want to check it out. In 2008, a young man in Beijing called Yang Jia killed 6 policemen in a police office. This film tells the story of the unjust trial from his mother's point of view. The Director depicts the tragedy of the killer's mother with a calm and placid tone. Let her if she wants to speak her mind. We might as well just see each other online. Come on. When your mother was young, she joined the infrastructure development in Sichuan. She didn't return to the Northeast to see her parents until 12 years later. In comparison, we aren't doing too badly. I understand the way you feel but... You can't possibly understand the way I feel. Please pull over. I wanna get off first. Alright. I want to be alone for a while. Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Wow! This feels cool, doesn't it? This feels like paradise. This way please. Follow him please. This way. The three tables near the windows. The three at the back are also ours Excuse me! This way please. He's sound asleep. It's too hot. Let's get him some food. I'll do it. What does he like? - These. - Okay. Didn't you tell Yang Shu about the demolition? Yes, but she was busy. She didn't take notice. You see. There are things you can't tell her. She's at the screening. She'll come later. Kaming. You've been travelling between the two places for 5 years. It must be hard on you. You've sacrificed your career. It must be difficult for you. Not at all, Mum. Most of the curation can be done at home. Don't worry. Is it true that all the festivals in China... have been stopped? Mostly the independent film festivals. But we break the programs into smaller events and give them less controversial titles. We can still do bits and pieces. It's impossible for directors like Yang Shu to have any screenings though. She's different since you got married. You told me. She's impulsive. Yes. So there are many things I don't tell her on the internet. Pass me the lid. Mum. You'll have your operation soon. You're alone at home. You can't refuse to relocate. It's good that there is a peaceful solution. And the compensation isn't bad. Ms. Yang is not with you? Ms. Peng, I've bought you a lot of gifts. I keep forgetting to bring them. You're so kind. Enjoy the lunch. I can't ask Yang Shu about her work. Please remind her to be careful with... what she says and keep a low profile. I will. She's preparing for a new film. We don't know what will happen when it's completed. So you two must meet in Taiwan this time. Hong Kong is no longer the same as before. If the day comes, when we have to sever our relations don't be too surprised. I never take Yue Yue with me when I go see you. I'm worried that the police might take him. I hope you understand. Look, he's so adorable. Your husband was given a 5-year sentence. That was absurd. During June 4th in 1989... he had never said anything wrong in public. The arrest was wrongful. Didn't you repeal the mistake afterwards? I don't want to discuss that anymore. That is exactly the cause of... your family's discontent with the society and the government. Principal Chen, you're an educated person. There are things that aren't nice to say, but I have to say them. Making a film about Yang Jia is a serious case. We've come all the way from Shanghai with a special order from the Bureau Chief. How could we otherwise operate in Sichuan? Your family came to Sichuan in the 1960s from the Northeast to join the infrastructure development and contributed a lot to the country You're a good cadre. I should be courteous with you, but all are equal before the law. Yang Jia attacked the police. He killed 6 innocent policemen. The victims' families are innocent too. Why don't those human rights lawyers, activists and internet mobs fight for their justice? Yang Shu's film distorts the truth and hurts the victims' feelings. She takes the sides with the scum of society. She must stop the release or re-edit it as we demand or we'll take enforcement measures and further harsh steps. She would never be allowed to enter the country again. Can't you go to Hong Kong and tell her this in person? She'll make decisions she believes to be right. Brother Jo, let's walk through this scene. I'm the volunteer from the elderly home here to conduct a survey. Okay. Director, can you really speak Cantonese? Not quite but I have to. Your daughter has joined the Occupy Movement in Admiralty. She hasn't come home for days. She comes to see you, but we've come at the same time for the survey. She didn't know you were moving to the elderly home so soon. This is the roof of your building. Your daughter is over there. She's watching us. Does she know I'm moving to the elderly home? Yes, she does. And she paid for it. But she still feels upset and unbearable when it becomes imminent. Okay, let's try. Uncle To, can you tell me about your family? My wife died of illness 8 years ago. I have only one daughter. Uncle To, when did you start living alone? About 5 years ago... when my daughter got married. How often do you see your daughter? At the end of every year. But there were a few times she couldn't come back. Uncle To, when did you apply for the elderly home? A year ago. My daughter is good to me. She paid for it. Why did you make this choice? My health started to deteriorate. Sometimes I take the wrong medication by mistake. Director, there is something about your life in this script, isn't there? Your daughter made a film criticising the state recently. Why don't you keep an eye on her? She's a married woman. How can I keep an eye on her? You've come from the family of an old cadre. Your parents have built the People's Republic. You can't let your next generation ruin it. When my parents were imprisoned in the labour farm in 1957. I was 10. Every day, I copied their confessions for them and tried to find ways to send them clothes. Nobody praised them for having built the People's Republic back then. Where is Yang Shu now? She's teaching in Hong Kong. - I bet she makes good money. - Mummy! I don't know anything about that. Can you ask her to come back? She's got her own job. I don't have the right to. It's too easy for us to get her. We're here to offer your family a chance. I don't need this chance. If she really has done something to subvert the state I'll just disassociate myself from her. "Guilty by association is a shameful policy. Come to me for my own actions." Do you remember this photo? I took it 5 years ago. Take another one for me. Why? I want a photo of me campaigning for my right to... accompany my mother home for her operation. I'll post it on social media. Then I'll go back to Sichuan to exercise my rights. Will you come with me to broadcast my actions live? I don't want this to happen to my family again. Do you understand? You want to go back to live in a nail house? Just to make a statement of your identity? I just want to do what an ordinary daughter should do. Please! You're no longer an ordinary daughter. You haven't been an ordinary Chinese daughter for a long time. But I can't stay in Hong Kong forever. Your son is a Hong Kong citizen. Your husband, I, I am a Hong Kong citizen. Hong Kong is your home now. But isn't it worth a try? Things are much worse than 5 years ago and you know it. Your mother has made all efforts to make it to Taiwan. All she wants is to see you safe. "I want to go home." We were together when you came to teach in Hong Kong 5 years ago. The police could not find you in Sichuan. Your mother called you and hinted that you shouldn't go back. I went to see her when things quietened down. She said you were impulsive and asked me to take care of you. I promised her I would. Are you saying I shouldn't do anything, because you've made her the promise? So many friends in Hong Kong have helped us. We can't let them do all that in vain. They've helped us even with this trip. Chu Hong! Put my luggage in for me. The driver will do it. - Please wait. - What is it? I'll put my own luggage in Please put it here first. Souvenirs are on this side. Clothes over there. These are handicraft from Taiwanese aborigines. These are crystal and jade. Buy some back. They'll bring you good fortune. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20... Are you feeling unwell? Just a bit tired today. Help me get on the bus for a rest. I don't know why I feel discomfort in my stomach. Have you taken your medication? Yes, I have. Maybe I'm not used to the food & climate. Why have you come back? She doesn't feel well. Ms. Peng, let's talk outside. I can't... just hide in your home in Hong Kong, or let them dig up your father's grave without me being there. When your father was wrongly accused, he disappeared for a long time. Later when he got sentenced, he severed relationship with us to protect us. I knew about his disappearance and sentence, but not about him severing ties with us. Why are you telling me now? I want you to know that... it's already the worst case scenario. But I'm worried about your operation. Don't ever come back. I've given you the pen recorder, so you can understand the situation. It's no big deal. It's no big deal. 5 years ago I worried that the police might disturb you. So I started writing a reflection statement. Before I finished it, they came to me in Hong Kong. So I never used it. Did they really go find you in Hong Kong? They did. They asked me to cancel the screenings or re-edit the film. I refused. They promised me things. They even asked the Hong Kong police to extradite me. The police refused. They also went to Korea and asked the film festival to sell them the film's copyright. The festival refused them too. They only stopped after the film was released and the press began to report on it. I knew about some of that, not all. I asked Kaming not to tell you everything. Come over here, read this out for me. I, Yang Shu, hereby submit my reflection to the Shanghai Police Bureau. I made this film without permission from the General Administration of Film Bureau. I obtained overseas monies to fund my illegal filming. I submitted the film for screenings in China and overseas without applying for permission. There were many serious mistakes in the procedure. I have reflected on this and regretted it. The content of the film does not match the facts of the Yang Jia case. I made things up based on internet rumors. This has hurt the feelings of the police and their families seriously. I was young, unaware and simple-minded. I was used by overseas anti-Chinese forces... for their ideological invasion. I was no more than cannon fodder in their game. Cannon fodder? Yes, cannon fodder. I copied your grandparent's reflection statements since I was 10. You have definitely inherited my talents. Pai, where is the toilet? This way. Thank you. Kaming, I'm going to find Mum. Okay. Hello. Hello. - Hi. - Hello. You're a good boy. Have some candies. Do you want candies? Don't be afraid. It's for you. Is that your grandma? Yes? No? Your grandma? No? Who is she? Who is she? Why asked me to follow her? A friend. Are they from the mainland? Aren't they mainland tourists? So you're Chinese, aren't you? - Not really. - No? Hong Kong? I'm from Hong Kong. So I say. Ties aren't easy to sever, are they? All entangled together. Yes. - It's simpler for Taiwan. - Isn't it? Taiwan is independent. Taiwan is separate from China. One country on each side, no? So you're pro-independence. I am. Our situation isn't as complicated as yours. Burnt in water, and frozen by fire. I want to turn into a deer. Where should I go? Nie Zheng Ping, Zhang Xiao Yi. And Li Qi. You forgot to stay together. Did you have fun? You must remember the concept of collectivism. I don't want to miss you out. Look over here. Say cheese. Cheese. Again! Big smiles! Say cheese! Cheese! Let's take one together. 1, 2, 3. Wonderful. I'll send it to everybody. We've got our Wechat group. Let's play with this. Can I join you? Can I join you? Of course. Mum. This looks like the amusement park behind our house. But that was demolished more than 10 years ago. This is my McDull. Your McDull. This is McDull's little bed. This is a wooden gun. This is me. These are their friends. This is also their friend. This is Yau Yau. This is Sin Sin. This is... and this... also their friends. This is the hammock from Grandma's house, isn't it? This is them catching me. - They are catching you. - Is that Yau Yau? It's fine. It's fine. We can deal with this. You don't all have to be here. Don't worry. This will affect the rest of our itinerary. Okay. Goodbye. Ms. Yang, please come over. I want to have a word with you. Madam Chen is so ill. It's very irresponsible of you to allow her to travel this far. I have asked the hospital to certify the situation and changed her ticket. She must go home immediately for treatment. Are you Chen Xiao Lin's family? This is her diagnosis. The doctor said her situation is critical. She needs the operation at once or her condition will deteriorate. Hey, Ms. Yang! Hey, Ms. Yang! I know it's hard on you. I hope you understand that it's nothing personal. Mum, come back to Hong Kong with us. I just found out that... Three investors of my new film have been missing for two months. It has just gone on the news. The Chinese police must have taken them. I must return to Sichuan. I worry they'll make life difficult for you. Then we should stop contacting each other. I'll tell the police I've severed ties with you. That'll solve the problem. But you need to be taken care of now. Excuse me, the door must be kept open. Sorry, we're sorry. I'll go back with Mum. Kaming, do you understand what is the Chinese way of love? That was. While I appreciate your kindness, I must decline it because I truly care about you. No way, Mum. I'm coming with you no matter what. I'm a Hong Konger. "Yuk Yin, I'll wait up for you to come back home for dinner." "I'll bail you out of custody." According to a source, this company has plans to collaborate with Yang Shu, a Chinese director in exile on a film about the Umbrella Movement and Hong Kong's self-determination. They are under Chinese surveillance. Last year they produced and distributed a controversial political film... Give it to me please. ...They will be seen as serious threats to One Country Two Systems and Hong Kong's freedom of speech. Hong Kong's Chief Secretary for Administration has expressed deep concern for the incident. Let me do this. Stop it. Stop it. ...has revealed plans for a protest on Sunday, and to file a complaint to the China Liaison Office and the UN Human Rights Committee. Do you know what to do if you lose contact with me? No? Stop it. Come on. I'll WhatsApp you my Facebook and Weibo passwords when I'm on my way. Read this to Yue Yue. "Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macau Residents" "Permanent Hong Kong Identity Card" Grandma, I just saw Mummy on TV. Oh... Grandma, have you taken your medication? Yes, I have. What a good boy. Thanks for reminding me, good boy. Yue Yue, will you take a photo with Grandma? Yes. What a good boy! Come... sit with Grandma. Shall we take a photo together? Come here, you're a good boy. You can see yourself, right? I didn't give you any dowry when you got married. Let me give you this necklace. It looks the same as mine. Do you like it? Yes, I do. Mum... You haven't watched "The Mother of One Recluse" yet. It doesn't matter. You know I don't often watch films. For the last few years, I've been having a recurring dream, about you and Dad walking further and further away in front of me. I called out for you, no matter how loud, you never heard me. When you were little, you often sang a song in the park behind our house. Do you remember the song? Neither do I. Mum. Let me sing you a song Yue Yue sings. "There's water in the clouds." "There's fish in the water." "There's a seed in the earth." There are flowers in the seed. - "There are stars in the sky." - That is Big Bus! - "There's brightness in the stars." - Yes, Big Bus.
