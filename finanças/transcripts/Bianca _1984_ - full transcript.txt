THE MASS HAS ENDED Lord, bless those alliances. These newly weds will wear them as a sign of fidelity in respect of your wishes and serenity. May they always live in a mutual love. In the name of Christ, Our Lord. - Amen - Amen Silvia, accept this ring as a sign of love and fidelity. In the name of The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit Alessandro, accept this ring as a sign of love and fidelity. In the name of The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit You can all sit down. Alesandro and Silvia. You just received the Sacrament. I hope that you are both aware of it. I don't really know Alessandro. But not Silvia. I know her since a long time. Silvia isn't a bad person. She is not bad, like some may say. This Sacrament oblige you to an absolute fidelity that only death could undo. I wish you both to live in harmony which is of great virtue, an immense gift. Never be sad! Preserve this joy, may you never loose it. I am asking you three things: One, reciprocal fidelity. Two, children's education, and three, reciprocal fidelity again. Quiet. Here. And Simone? How is he? Where is he? As always. He's studying eagles on the mountain. I really like Simone. You too, Nicola? Oh yes. He's a very good man. Why don't you get married? This one is for you. Double portion! After so many years, far away from home... They should have given you a village closer, more on the center. You got sent to the suburbs? Yes, it's quite far. Uhm. At least you get a home, right? - Yes, unfortunately - You don't like it? No, no. I haven't seen it yet, but... Here is good, too! Dad, I'm leaving. I'm bringing Valentina to her work. Everything alright? I was thinking of universal love. Does it exist? What do you priests think? Us, priests... believe it does. And I do too. And Simone. When did you last saw him? It's here that I work. Ah! It is not a very cozy place. What kind of people come to a Center of Mental Health? People who are not well. And here, they get worse. Can you paint some colors.... They promised us a new building a long time ago. A month? A week? When did you last saw Simone? You're not answering? See you tomorrow. Valentina... listen. How do you do it? You meet half-way on the mountains? Is he coming from Rome? Valentina, don't do like the others. Build something solid, okay? This it is the answering machine of the 3965216. I'm home but I do not want to speak to anyone right now. If you feel like it, please leave a message. Saverio, open up! It's me, Giulio! Something's wrong? I perfectly know that you're inside. It's me, Giulio! Did you know that I became a priest? Saverio? Is everything alright? It's really you... Hi. Good bye. You're not inviting me in? I was talking with Gianni. Perfect, I'll come say hello. - Giulio! - Hi Dear Gianni, I don't know why I am telling you last I'm sorry, but the time has come for you too... I don't want to see you again. So don't come back, don't call, and don't write me anymore... like Cesare insists on doing. He's inviting everyone to a big reunion like old times. You two go ahead, I'm not going. I brought you this month's books. Well, I'm leaving. Bye. We'll see each other at Cesare's. Do you recall? Many years ago. We had a common project or more likely a common dream. We were wrong! And why? We put our trust on mankind. And mankind is nothing, barely a dot. Giulio knows it. From now on, I know it too. That's why I wanted you close to me. To tell you that I decided to get baptized. I want to become catholic, do my first communion. I want to see you all at this celebration. This is a big day. You need to think about it? I can imagine. It must be a surprise to you. Stay where you are. I will play for you. How was the other priest? Young, old? Why are you laughing? Why did he had to leave? He didn't. He's living nearby, on the other side of the street. Father, it's useless. There's no one there. No one? No. Let's go see! Maybe they don't know the church has reopened. They all go to another church nearby. It's much better there than this one! In the name of The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit. Amen. May the Lord be with you. And with your spirit. My brothers, to celebrate with dignity the Holy Mysteries, let's recognize our sins. Hello. Hi, I was looking for Don Antonio. He's here. Antonio, you have a visitor! The new priest! Sorry, you're working... I was passing the time. Come on in. No, I only wanted to talk to you... We'll play later. Now, go read. Problems at the church? - No, no. Well, yes. No one comes. It's my fault. When I told them I had a child... and that I wanted to marry because of it... It can happen, you meet someone... and you feel like you can't be without them. Well, they are now all going to the other church. Will you have lunch with us? - No, thanks. I have a lot to do. - Too bad. Such a beautiful weather. We're eating outside. No. Too bad, it'll be for another time... They refuse to understand that Lucia and Matteo strengthen my vocation. Loving them doesn't prevent me to love others as well. Love can't be divided. It doesn't diminish when you give some to others. Don't you think? I never thought about it. Why didn't you move? The air is good here, and for my child Matteo. - Ah, Matteo... - Why this question? Right here, in front of the church, I don't know... Ah, for the people and children, right? No, it's me. It's bothering me. - Don't worry! - Well yes, I do worry... - I'll take these - No, they're too old. If you'd seen those at the church! - Listen, I'd like to talk to you about Andrea. Did you notice that he wasn't at Cesare's reunion? - Yes, and why's that? - He's been in jail, for a long time now. - What did he do? - They say he was part of a group. What group? Terrorist. But we don't know what he's done. - I had no clue. - Gianni! I told you, I'm not interested. There's everything by Mao Tse-tung, by Lenin... An amazingly rare collection! And these? Record from the Congress of the Albanian Communist Party. Free for you. The others, I'm offering a 90% discount. Put them there. I'm coming. I got him an excellent lawyer. But I think you should go see him in jail. But why me? Why? Because you're a priest! Are you being treated well? Yes. They're nice. You do some sport, exercise? Enough. You want to tell me something? This suit looks good on you. - You don't want to talk? - About what? About the moment you decided to become a terrorist. No. I don't want to. You remember the paper we published? It was great. No, I don't remember. Andrea, what did you do? I don't understand! I read a lot, here. Gianni sends me books, but he never comes to visit. But I'm here! Will you bring me some issues of our paper? - It was really bad! - No. It was fun. Fun? I wouldn't say that. Will you come back? If you want. Father, sorry to disturb you. I'm Andrea's lawyer. Hello. - Can I talk to you? - Sure - He didn't receive you well, right? - No I have a hard time dealing with this. He already did 6 years in prison. It's a lot for his age. He doesn't talk, doesn't say anything about it, not even to me... Is he innocent? Guilty? Nobody says anything! If only I knew! I need your help, Father. Testify in his favor at his trial. Well, say anything you want... You know, a priest friend always makes a good impression. Don't abuse it! - For once you kissed me. - Yes indeed. Mother, I almost feel like moving back here. As you wish. Your decision will be ours. Okay. Listen to this: "Between the idea and reality, the movement and action," "the shadow gets thicker" Mom and dad are getting older, I can't take it. "It'll happen to us too and you'll be laughing!" "On that day, you'll be laughing but you won't be able to let go of me." "You're feeling lonely with your freedom" "and that's why you'll come back". "You'll come back..." Did you understand what I meant by Jesus's humanity? Who can answer? Let's listen to Federico. Jesus often got angry. That is 'human'. He was terrible when he got angry... He'd flip tables upside down, scaring away vendors out of the Temple. Shouted against the demons. He was strong and brave. Stronger and braver then anybody else? Of course. But just before he got arrested, at Gethsemane with his apostles, he said: "Could you stay with me?" Why? What did he want from them? To get comforted by his friends? Why did he want that? Because... Yes, you go ahead. He was feeling alone. He was scared. Loneliness is scary. So, I told myself: I need to burn my bridges. - You understand? - Not really And then, we only have one life. A unique occasion like that... won't happen again... But why aren't you saying anything? I'm listening. Without religion, all is gray and sad. Think about Baptism... It's a celebration! Nothing like a birth certificate. Baptism is the entrance into society. Civil funerals, it's ugly, sinister! And don't get me started on civil weddings... - The church, the temple... - Pass me the ball! Saverio! Ah, hello. Hello. The lady downstairs called me... her apartment is flooded. Hi. You should plant some flowers on the terrace! I brought you some seeds. Can you help me out? Sure. What should I do? Look what I just found! "The winter of our dissatisfactions" - Your poetry - I burned them all Except these. There. Now there's none. You know what I'd like? Scrape the walls, paint them white. Clean the house, wear my raincoat at the dye shop... - What's stopping you? Why go at the dye shop with a raincoat? You want to tell me? For who? You're not answering... What's the meaning of life? Life has no meaning. - It's hidden, sometimes, but... - Life is vulgar. - What are you doing now? - Going to bed It's only 6pm! I was there before you... Sir, that's my spot. - You bought it maybe? - No! Don't touch my father! No. Your father and I need to talk! Sir. It was my spot, you know. Sir, wait a minute. - It was my spot - Yes! You can't do that to me! What is it? Why did you come? - I wanted to talk to you - Not now, maybe later It's important. If you hadn't come back, I would have written you. I may have seemed to be closed, a bit reserved. I seem to be closed-off, I seem impenetrable, or whatever... But I am transparent! My face is an open book. You, for example, what do you read in me, right now? A year ago, I met this woman and fell in love with her. Her name is Arianna. She's a friend of your sister's. - Since this morning, I'm living with her. - And mom? She doesn't know. I tried to tell her, but I don't have the courage. -You tell her - Me? Me? But how? Can you explain how you could do that... There's nothing to explain, it just happened! I swear, I wasn't even thinking about it. At my age, can you believe it? She's at least 30 years younger than you! I know. So what? Mister Bellani proposed to... his secretary. He's 76 years old! What an asshole! - Did you know about dad? - Did he tell you? I want to know why you haven't told me. He left the house this morning. If I had told you, what could you have done? How can this be happening? Maybe it's love. I found it at the house. I was scared mom would read it. A copy of a letter he wrote. "My love, I feel like I'm 20 again." "Yesterday, it was Spring. When I saw you..." "I thought of all the Springs and Autumns before we met." "Who knows? Maybe we crossed each other before." "Where could it have happened?" "Maybe I was on a bus, and you were waiting at a traffic light?" "Now, I really got to know you." "Now, I really got to know you." "We talked to each other." "Bit by bit, I realized the life I lived without you so far..." "was a life without joy." "A life that had yet to find its purest expression." "With you, all is different. Everything is better." "I want to change and I will. "I feel more generous and able to do good." Hello! Come in, please. Where's my father? At work. He works in the morning. Come in if you want. Those are beautiful colors! - The place isn't.... - Want some coffee? No thanks. I didn't come for this. You keep the TV on all day? It's a bad habit, you know! Very bad for you. Look at the dust! How long has this book been here? 2 or 3 years? Who wants to read it? Uh? Your father will be back later. No. It's not my father I want to talk to, It's you! Very well. I want to speak with you. I think it's fair, no? Yes. Goodbye. You know, in confessions. I hear so many things, so many stories. And sometimes, I feel I can understand people and the problems between them. Why one does this and the other does that... Why people hurt each other? But everyone obeys their own laws. Something within us that we can't understand. And dad too, what do we know? Maybe... Maybe it's temporary? Maybe it's only... What do you think? Don't cry please. No don't cry, I beg you! Don't cry! Leave me alone! Hi. Hi. What are you doing? We're celebrating Matteo. We bought nice gifts! Is it his birthday? It's always his birthday! Will you come and play? No thanks, I can't. I don't need anything. I just want to be here. I'm watching. Do what you have to do. Let's open the package That's good. - Ready? - Ready to go. I want the green car. Of course. - What do you want? - The green one No, we're playing now. You wait a bit. I'm playing, you're not. No, we spent the whole afternoon building this circuit. No! Yes! Go play cards, ball, at whatever you want. For 3 hours, this is ours. - Okay, I'll give him my spot. - We'll play for 3 hours minimum! He's having a difficult time. His first erotic struggles! Yesterday, we were walking... there was a billboard with a topless woman. Do you know what he said to me? "Dad, is that woman barefooted... "or is she wearing shoes?" That's so cute! Last night, he was spying under our bed. and the other day, in the garden, there was a rooster and a hen... So he went between them, and when the rooster came forward, the hen.... Who are you people? Sorry for being late, Father. Is this where the prenuptial classes are? Ah yes. True. It's here indeed. - How many months? - Seven and a half. The countdown has started. Yes, please. My brother Alberto got married at the church of Don Vincenzo. For their classes, they showed films, slides, Psychologists would come and talk to the couples. Yes, but we should talk about marriage, not in the ... Not in the way some women's magazines do, Recommending couples to have summer affairs... It's true! I swear, those magazines... People usually decide to get married without getting to know each other fully. That's bad. What do you propose? "Knowing" each other in the biblical sense, like these two? I don't understand. Just kidding! - Giulio! - Hi! Good bye now. Giulio, he's Andrea's lawyer. - Giulio! - No! - Sorry Father. What is it? You shouldn't have come here. - About the trial... - What about it? It's in two days. I added you as a witness. So Father, you know the accused? You were friends. I haven't seen him in 9 years. How did you meet him? It was about 10 or 11 years ago. We were working on a paper together. - Political? - Yes. A man like you... I wasn't a priest yet back then. Too bad, you would've had a positive influence on the accused. Ah, is that a joke? Great humor! You're very humorous! Do not address the court this way! When did you learn that the accused was a terrorist? Never. Have you ever heard him talk about ideas, let's say, against the law? Plans of urban guerrilla for example... Yes, like everyone else. What do you mean by everyone else? Back then, many people were talking about these things. But your friend went further then just some talking... We found a real arsenal at his place. Tell the truth, Father. Have you heard him say, I don't know, a name, a target, something? You have, haven't you? I didn't say that! If you're planning a trap, I'm leaving! What are you talking about? Sit down. Why did we call him as a witness? I would like to know! What he is doing here? Are we supposed to sing the mass in a choir? Don't be an idiot! Understand? That's enough! Where do you think you are? You're upsetting the Court and the accused. Go back to your seat. Actually, go away please. Be nice, just leave. Someone to share the fatigue of life, get up in the morning, check if the weather is good or not. with whom to talk about shopping at breakfast. All I need is a written list of things to buy. I'll go out and make the purchases and then come back. I'll even cook. I only need someone to be with me. Anyone really. You're not talking about anybody. You're talking about a woman, Astrid! I realized that. You two still love eeach other. Listen to what she was writing: "When I left..." "I was happy, I felt free, far away from your fears." You wanna go for a walk? You look so elegant! Let's go, ok? Yes. But I'll decide where to go! He always stays longer than the others. He can go on like this for hours, slowly, without ever stopping. By now, he's more like a fish than a child! - Could it be... - Astrid's son He arrived about a year after Astrid left. She called and told me about it. I don't even know who the father is. It hurt me so much that I decided to never see her again. It's been two years since. One night I phoned her and it was him who answered. He was talking! He grew up without me. I didn't see his first steps... If I were to live with Astrid again, And I know it will end like this. What do we tell that child? Should we tell him we were in love, but fighting all the time? What will we tell him? That's enough now! Get out! Here! - Hey! - Francesco! It's Astrid! Saverio! Your father is an innocent man. He always stayed home. It's not his fault. But not her! She stalked him. She chased him! I'm sure of it! One day I'll tell her: "You need to give him back to me!" No, I won't say that. "You shouldn't do this kind of things..." "You shouldn't be like this at your age" You need to learn how to live, my dear. Why were you looking at me? When? You were looking at me and saw how ugly and old I am. No. Not at all! Sometimes, I'm watching you. I see you being preoccupied, nervous. Don't deny it, I've been watching you for quite a while. Tonight, I prayed for you. By praying, I can do a lot for people. Of course, you need to pull yourself together and have a pure heart. Tonight, I cried. But later in my head, the fog started to fade away. And far away, I saw a light. Do you know what this light is? My real vocation! Giulio, I want to become a priest! No. That's not true... Yes! From now on, I'm prohibiting you to come at Catholic class! Good afternoon! - Hi - Giulio! We wanted to surprise you. You came in too early. So many years alone and you can't take good care of yourself! What a mess! The washing machine doesn't work! How do you wash your clothes? At the Laundromat, every time? I give them to my mother. We wanted to talk with you. We can never talk calmly with you... Talk about what? - Of you! - Me? We think about you, here, alone. You shouldn't live like an hermit, far from everything. You say nothing but we know that you're not doing well. I'm doing fine. You refuse to talk to your friends. Aren't we your friends? So how can we help you? - Why do you refuse to be helped? - What do you want from me? If you refuse to talk about things that bother you... we won't come to see you anymore! Okay? Hello. Who's this? Oh, the lawyer! Only two words. Can I? No. I have a busy day. Two words... No, I have a mass soon and a prenuptial class. Some other time. Two words... Good bye then. I wanted to say... Andrea's been released. By lack of evidence. He's free now! Good bye. You know what he said? He told me: "Let me live my dream" You heard me? His dream! He can't tell me such a thing! I know, I make a lot of mistakes. I hid the bad things away. I thought that he was fragile, that he needed to be protected from reality. He was so affectionate towards me. But when he'll return, I won't be so stupid. We need to talk. Have a very long talk. He'll be in love with me again. Hello? Yes, it's me Mr. Director. I couldn't come... Yes, yes, yes. It's the library. Giulio, if I was leaving, would mum suffer? With Simone? It would please her. And me as well. No, alone. I want to live without anybody around. No one. And there's something else... I'm pregnant but I don't want to keep it. I want an abortion. Simone doesn't know. I want to leave him. How can I tell him? One day at the village, a girl did this. She was always thinking about it. It's a terrible thing that you can never forget. You know that? I know. You really don't want to keep it? No. If you do this, I'll kill you and then kill myself. Do you know how many griffon couples are left? Thirty! Red kites? Peregrine falcons? Short-toed eagles? If we don't hurry, it's goodbye to the raptors! Without the raptors, the snakes will grow in number. I can't stand to see birds in cities, it's like they've gone mad. They get into houses, do their nest in cars, or in abandoned theaters. Seagulls are eating all the fish in public fountains. And why are you against the snakes? This viper is a delicate animal, very shy. Simone, I have something important to tell you. Valentina is pregnant. And she doesn't want to keep it. Try to convince her. You don't know your own sister. If she already decided... Please try! You hear me! Try! Yes. I'm confused. I don't understand what's going on. Maybe I've lived alone for too long. Since I have my new church... I can't work anymore, I can't concentrate. People go through so much trouble. They come and talk to me... and many times, I get distracted, thinking about my own problems. My sister is... or was... with some kind of fool. Sometimes, I refuse absolution. Some people don't really repent. Actually, sometimes, I'd like to hit some of them. Yes, I think about it quite often. Isn't there any other way? They only talk about sex. Their sexual sins. Because they know their venial sins. They even take pleasure to talk about them. But the real sins, the sins against others, they never talk about them. And even if they really needed me, what could I tell them? I'm worse at it than they are. Do you wanto to go back to where you were before? I was doing just fine at the village. I'd like to go back, but now I would feel like I was running away. - It must be nice to live here - I just arrived - Ah, I thought... - Not so long ago I was far away from here Just above the Antarctic Circle. Near the Magellan Strait. You know where? Vaguely. A tiny wooden church... held by steel cables. Why? To prevent the wind to move it. The wind is so violent sometimes, if you stay outside too long... you go completely mad! Why were you there? Someone had to be there. People living there are really suffering. You were their priest? I was their friend. I was asked to leave because of my age. But I asked a new authorization. Before I die, I'd like to go back there. Wasn't it worse for Simone to learn about it from you? What's it got to do with you? - I was supposed to...! - Yeah, you would have told him ... and then what? Why do you have to act like the others? Uh? You do everything you can to suffer! Do I need to tell you there's no freedom in being alone? That the real freedom, is being a couple? You don't know that! What are you talking about? I don't want to see you suffer! You understand? There's plenty of people who are in pain, you take care of them! Those who really suffer and there's no one listening to them. I'm trying to do this! But... But you can't do it! Nobody can! Why did you come back? Don't you see... You can't change anything! What's your purpose? When I came back, I had decided to go back to school. I really wanted to! But I can't achieve anything! One of these days, I want to give Mom a parasol as a gift. They're not in style anymore. Yeah, it's true. Why? - Bye - Bye Look who's there! Say 'Hello!' Hello! Hello! - See you! - See you! Lucia, this pie was delicious. She made it. Will you take him to the gym today? No. I have a translation to do. Are you doing this again? Like yesterday? - Listen please. - Don't fight. I don't mind others fighting but not you two. I've come here to find calm and happiness. What's going on? Antonio. I don't know what happened, he doesn't want to stay here. He can't handle this house anymore. Maybe there's too much of my stuff. This house is all made to my image. Is she right? Yes. Yesterday we had a fight and then we made peace. Last night, we made love four times. Fantastic! That's irrelevant. Is it true, what she said? - Yes. - Ok, that's enough! If you love each other, you can live anywhere. I've had enough today! Have you seen your outfit? You think you're at the beach? Look at you, wearing a dress with slippers! I'm exhausted. My feet hurt. Your feet hurt! You can't welcome people with slippers! And if you invite me, make sure you know how to cook! I don't mind what I'll eat... but even the tortellini... Yes. They were disgusting! And this tasteless soup with carrots and potatoes! Where does it come from? We've been cooking all morning, right Antonio? Yes, but that makes it worse! It's pathetic! And him? What will happen to him? - He's thinking - You're proud of him? He's a perfect little man. Yes, he makes us very happy. Your eyes shine every time we talk about him! You think he's the first kid in this world? You have some problems. Problems? What problems? This story is always repeating itself in the exact same way ! He's not the first child born in this world! I don't ever want to see you or talk to you again... or have any news about you and the others. Recently, I had tolerated it. Now, I have enough. I will never get out of here... You and the others, can you please... forget that I exist? I'm sorry, Giulio. But you do understand me, right? No, I don't understand. You all belong to a period that I want to forget. You remind me of Astrid. And I'm tired... Aren't you never tired Giulio? That summer, I wasn't well at all. Why? The usual reasons... - Which ones? - Sentimental reasons Ah, yes. A love story that was ending. I tried to kill myself in the public toilets. I wanted to die in a sordid place. I slashed my veins... Father, are you listening to me? Yes, of course... But I think you should talk about it to your parents. Yes I tried but... talking to your parents, ... loving your parents, it's old fashion now. Yes it's old fashion maybe but it's very important. Only them can understand you. What can a stranger know? - Yes, it's a good thing but... - So... I will absolve you. In the name of The Father, The Son and the Holy Spirit. I'm confused, Giulio. You need to help me, like a friend would. I don't understand anymore. I miss so many things: the house, the flowers on the terrace, my books. Today, I saw your mother. I asked her to understand me, to support me. I cannot be happy if she's sad. You always think about yourself? Giulio, I needed to talk to her because I want a child with Arianna. What? I beg you, don't be like your mother. Don't say no. You can do some sacrifices. Let me finish. Lately, I've been thinking about death... And I'm scared. A child at my age, it's not a crime... And Arianna has the right to be a mother. To have a child from the man she loves. Stop it! Shut up! Giulio. It's true, I'm a mess. But at least, you can help me out. Let go of me. No, you're a priest, you must confess me… give me absolution. Confess me, Giulio! Enough! Enough! Get out! Get out! Out! Out! Out! - What's this? - An assignment. Read it. "My dad: I live surrounded by lots of people" "but the one I love most is my dad." "He's a small and strong man. For me, he's a model." "Maybe too much of a model. To be honest, he's nice with me..." "because I'm his only daughter." Excellent. It's a lovely paper you wrote. Thank you. I love all of you here! - No, this isn't it.... - Then try to look... - Hello - Hello - Why are you here? For starters. It was Gianni's idea. Let's ask the priest. Honestly... Do you think this book is suitable for a woman? Sure, why not? - Wow, nice going. - Yeah, we're fine. Don't you think it's too much...? Then take this one. You don't need anything? No, thank you. I don't need anything. - No, no, no. - No? No. Then check this out. Do you like it here? Why? Do I have a choice? - Do you see your friends? - Sometimes If you wanna talk to me, share your problems... - I don't wanna talk - Listen, Andrea... It's always the same story. - Same story? - Oh yes! - Why do you always say no? Is it the blurb? The title? Explain it to me, we'll exchange it. - It's not what I'm looking for... - It's not what you want? This book will please your lady friend. C'mon on now. If not, we'll replace it for you. You know me. I am a patient person. I'm trying to understand... Pardon me. I'm looking for a gift for an 8 years old girl. - Ah really? - Yes - Who gives a shit! Okay? - Giulio! - Hi - Hi I want to talk to you. At home, something happened... Sorry, I have an appointment. -Where? -At the theater next door. - Can I come? - Well, I'm meeting someone. Stay here, I'll be back soon. - It's Cesare. He plays because he's sad. - Good bye! - Bye Hi! I need to thank you. You did well to tell me off. I was going to make a mistake. I would never be a good priest. We need people like you with this sloppy look... but capable to reassure. You're good. You force us to be different and also be better. -You know what I decided to do? - No I want to get married. And I'd like you to officiate, with all the friends attending. It'll be so beautiful. Will you do it? Yes, of course. I'll do it. - Hi - One Gianni! What you are doing to him? What do you want? Let's go! Gianni! Is it good enough? Go away! Gianni! We're going to kill you now. Don't you see you're disgusting? At the train station... when you flirt in the toilets? Don't you feel guilty? You know when you fall so low... or so high, depending on your point of view. The women are pretty? Answer me! Yes they are, but they don't talk to me. Really? Do you recall the film with this chick the most beautiful woman in the world, where at one point she bathes in chocolate? She was rolling in it, chocolate all over herself. Remember? - No - And you? - I was only watching the chocolate. Before you die, tell me why you like men? I feel my body reborn, my pores reopens. My wrinkles disappears, my hair is growing back. These two idiots, what to do with them? - I'm going to kill you! - Wait. I'll recite Dante! Which canto do you prefer? Paradise, 1? I want to die teaching you something good, at last. "His glory, by whose might all things are moved..." "Pierces the universe, and in one part..." "Sheds more resplendace, elsewhere less, in Heaven" "That largeliest of His light partakes, was I," "Witness of thing, which, to relate again..." No! These guys are rel idiots. They're too stupid. C'mon, let's get out of here. Very well. Hello? What? Why did you do this? I'll never forgive you. Remember the first time we went into a bar... and got a hot chocolate with whipped cream? And that shop that was giving away rubber balls... to children who would buy shoes? I still have that ball, you know. I was happy whe I wnet out with you. I felt safe, because I knew you were there. It's nice to be a kid, without any kind of responsibility. and no one is asking you anything. I remember, one day... after playing ball with my friends, we sat on the grass. It was a long day and very sunny too. A Spring day that wouldn't end. The sun went down and we were exhausted. We looked at the sky going darker and darker... We felt the coolness of the grass, nobody would talk. On that day, I was very happy! At night, when I came home, I would tell you everything as always. You came all the way here... and yet, you didn't want to know how it would end. Have you ever had any idea how much I loved you? Why did you do this? And now, who will think about me? We're late, people are waiting... We should hurry up! - Uh? - Hurry! - Yes - Can you help me, please? - Yes. Thank you. Valentina? Hi. I can't stand living alone anymore. I'm not able to do anything. Come stay at my place for a while, will you? Yes, okay. Now is fine, too. Good bye. Father, the baby is born! It's a boy! I came for the baptism. Is Sunday morning okay with you? - What? - The baptism. I don't care at all. Emanuele, I baptize you in the name of The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit. Amen. Look at such perfection, such harmonious forms! Look at these tiny feet! May Our Lord Jesus, who made the deaf hear and the mute talk. Give you the grace to listen to His word and be faithful to you in the glory of God. Amen. Look! Hi Giulio, it's Andrea. I didn't come to confess... It's not mandatory. I learned that Cesare is getting married. And you? - We don't see you anymore! - I'm busy You told me to come see you. Yes but you come at a very difficult time. Do you recall when Cesare, Saverio and you were talking about changing the world with dignity to those who suffer? I was listening. Your words seemed right. But in reality, no one did anything. - Am I wrong? - I don't know Doing something demands some efforts. Alright. You're the victim. You're happy that I'm saying this? - Yes - Ok, are you finished? - Not yet Recently, I though I was like you. But then, the others started to have children. They changed their work and religion too. I'm the only one who stayed the same. I can't do anything. I didn't plan anything either. Why exactly? You chose this. Are you sure that you got nothing to do with this? Is there no fault of yours? Lord, bless those rings. This couple will wear them as a sign of fidelity in respect of your wishes and serenity. May they live an endless mutual love. - In the name of Christ, Our Lord. - Amen. Antonella, receive this ring as a sign of love and fidelity. In the name of The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit. Cesare, receive this ring as a sign of love and fidelity. In the name of The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit. You can sit down. Cesare and Antonella, you just received the Sacrament. I hope you are both aware of it. Your duty will be harsh. It's not easy to love each other. It's not natural like the love of a child. The other day in confession, a woman told me: "Mon son, I made him. My husband, it was another woman." Why am I telling you this? Why? No one can be loved as much as by their own mother. I believe in happiness. Life is made for happiness and not for pain. And solitude doesn't bring happiness. That's why I'm happy for you. That you decided to live your life together. My mother always liked celebrations... and with one like this, she'd be here. Valentina, do you remember, she would buy us Nougatine candy? Half chocolate, half nougat. They don't make those anymore. In October, one day she came in "Guess what I just brought you!" But we already knew! They were the first mandarins of the season. These days, we can find cherries and strawberries all year long. What kind of memories will our children keep? I wanted to read you a passage from the Bible where it says... Where is it? I can't find it... It doesn't matter because I need to say my last goodbye to you. I'm leaving... I'm going far away... To a place where the wind drives you crazy and where they need a friend. I can no longer stay here. I realized that I can't do anything for you. I tried but I failed. I hope you can forgive me. My life is great! Because I received a lot of love. I was lucky. - May the Lord be with you - And with your spirit May God almighty bless you all. Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
