Mason. Go! Lieutenant Pauling. Go! Grimes. Go! Corliss. Go! Dubrowski. Go! Lambert. Go! Corporal Dreef. Sergeant Forrest, come on. What a country. What a lousy swamp of a country. - So you're the first platoon - Of Dog Company? Yeah, this is it. You guys are the, the new replacements? Yeah. You Sergeant Forrest? - That's right. - I don't find no surprises. Looks just like I said he would. Fella in the orderly room sent us down here. - My name's Corliss. - How are you? This here is Talbot, and that there is Mason. - Well, welcome in. - My name's Foley. - You guys just made it. - We're about to make a little trip to the continent. - Yeah, I heard that, - And I'm real glad 'cause I sure do like to travel. Boy, listen to this accent. - Hey, Dixie, did you bring along - A jug of corn? Cut that out. - He went to school, - He wore shoes, too and he doesn't drink corn. I can fend for myself, Mason. Excuse me, sergeant. Nobody ever calls me Dixie, corporal. My name's Corliss. Okay, Corliss. Glad to know you. I'm Dreef. - - 'Well, where's the lieutenant - Likely to be?' - 'I suppose we gotta check in - With him and get the pep talk.' It's hard to say where he is, Mason. - He might be out somewhere - Rounding up generals to come to meet you. You're the comedian of the outfit, huh? Unh-unh. Name's Dubrowski. Ten, hut! As you were. - I'm Lieutenant Pauling. - Private Mason, sir. - Private Talbot? - Yes, sir. - Private Corliss? - Yes, sir. Yes. Glad to see you here. We've been expecting you. At ease. Sit down if you want to. Go ahead. - Since you're all ready - For a pep talk I'll give it to you now. - I'm sorry, sir, - I didn't see you. You're right. - Pep talks all say - The same things. "Go, team, go." "Get in there and fight." If you're not on the team, it all sounds pretty dull. Well, we are a team. A very special team with a special job to do. And now you're on it. Two years, all we've done is train this team for this job. We're ready. - Get with us - As quickly as you can. There isn't much time. Once we land behind enemy lines all we'll have in the world to hang on to is each other. These are all soldiers. Good men. The best I've ever known in my life. You must be good men, too, or you wouldn't be here. Not in this outfit. There just isn't anything in the army like this outfit. - So, welcome, Private Corliss. - Thank you, sir. - Private Talbot. - Thank you, sir. Private Mason. - Now, pep talk over. Sergeant. - Yes, sir? - Show them their sacks. - Yes, sir. - Goodnight, sir. - Goodnight, sir. - Goodnight, sir. - Well, goodnight. Goodnight, sir. He any good? Okay, so he's a prince. - I told you, we never should have - Left the merchant marine. Hey, you mean you two knew each other before? Yeah, we sailed the same load to Murmansk. Got torpedoed and Lacto froze to death. When we got home, we decided we wanted to get into an outfit where we could shoot back. - So they sent us to boys camp - For a year. We're still waitin' to shoot back. - Your friend acts like - He's mad they didn't make him a general right off. Ah, a whole nest of comedians, huh? Look, Mason, uh.. Look, the-the lieutenant tried to tell ya. This is a team. - Get on it. - Don't start out fightin' it. - He also told you - To get on it fast. - You can start - By pickin' up your mess. - We don't like cigar butts - On the floor. Don't handle. I said pick it up, Mason. And the gentleman wins this cigar. I'm a comedian too. You guys dress up all the time - just to go to Newbury - For a beer? Oh, sure. There's girls there too. - Will you play, Hernandez? - We haven't got all night. - I'm thinkin'. I'm thinkin'. - Well, play and think later. Okay, then hit me again. - Hit you again? - You've got seven cards already. - You know somethin', beer at that - Pub tastes like it's got soap. - Yeah, well, it shows you - They wash their glasses, anyway. Why, you got somethin' better? - You know, I hear - There's a guy in C Company - who's makin' a brew - Out of potato peelings. Yeah, but they want 3.10 pounds a quart and it's poison. - Oh. - Hit me just once more. Hernandez, I don't think you could count to 21 if you had your shoes off. - Twenty-one. - Twenty-one? Four aces, four deuces, and a nine of clubs. Well, teach a guy to play the game this is what he does to you. - Aren't you coming in - To Newbury? - Yeah, - I'm just waitin' for Mason. Mason? Oh, you're gonna have a long wait. - He'll be out there dropping from - That mock tower till midnight. I bet Sergeant Forrest makes him jump till he passes out. He sure could use some practice. - That was a lousy jump - He made today. - It sure was. - So he made a bad exit. His musette bag got caught. Oh, there he is, men, the combat-scarred hero - who fought the war - From the jump towers. Lay off him, huh? Have enough practice, Mason? Yeah. I had enough. - You wanna argue about it? - Let it pass, Mason. I'll handle this. Well, you got somethin' more to say? Yeah. This is my squad, see? - And it's gonna operate - Clean and smooth when we jump. - Like the lieutenant said, - We're a team. - Look, I came over here to fight, - Not drill. I had all that. - We get across, you're gonna be - Plenty glad I'm along. - You're gonna win the war - Single-handed, huh, wise guy? - I'll t... - Let me go, boys. Dreef! You wanna keep those stripes? Well, let's go. Come on. Alright, break it up. Let's get on that truck. Come on, Mason. Don't take it so serious. Leave me alone. Come on, Len, get dressed. - You can't just sit here - And brood. You too. - Well, - What's the matter with you? - You never did have - A sweet disposition but you're gettin' worse. You gettin' out of here or do I chuck you off? the only friend he's got left. Now, a man don't throw out And seein' as how as I am your only friend why don't you just sit back and open up? - I'm just fed up. - Sure. - They got themselves - A closed shop and that's that. - They're all against me. - No, they ain't. You're against them. I mean, you walk around like a bear trap ready to spring. - 'Ain't nobody - Out to get you, boy.' No, huh? Then how come Forrest riles me all the time and, Dreef, how come I get all the dirty work? Well, the trouble with you is you just ain't learned to be peaceful. Well, I-I remember on the farm. My daddy kept us all so peaceful. Twelve kids, Len, and I had twelve dogs, remember. He was just reasonable, that's all. Just plain reasonable. - Yeah, there was nothing - Reasonable about my old man. He was about as mean as they come. If my mother wasn't mean to begin with, he sure fixed it. My own mother turned me over to the cops when I was 14 for somethin' I didn't do. - Well, boy, you can't go - All through life - bein' mad over somethin' - That happened when you were 14. One time.. - ...one time I try - To go all out for someone. One time. And I get this. Yeah, I know. I know. But you gotta stop rememberin' every little thing. You gotta stop readin' that letter too. You're not the only soldier who ever got a Dear John. - Why don't you tear it up? - I use it to remind me. I'm joinin' nobody. I'm my own. Stop rememberin'? How do you do that? Go on, go on to town. Just leave me alone. Go on! Beat it! Get out of here. I'll see you later. fallin' in love. Nobody can help I planned to wait for you as we talked about but I met this fellow and everything changed. I'm getting married next week. I had to tell you this. I hope it doesn't hurt you. I don't think it will, because you're strong and nothin' hurts you. Please believe me when I say I'm sorry. And wish you the very best. Salud, anybody. Let's get on with the war. - What's the story, corporal? - Goin' to Newbury? - That's the general idea. - Well, you better head back. - Look, corporal, - You're makin' a mistake. These men have passes. - Call the base. - I just called the base. - They've requested you return - Immediately. - What's he talking about? - We got passes! - Immediate return, you can figure - It out, can't you, sergeant? All passes cancelled. Oh. Yeah. Come on. Hurry up. Alright, we move into the marshalling area right away. As of now, you're cut off. Out of communication with anybody. No phone calls, no letters. D-Day H-hour is any minute. Tonight, tomorrow night, a week from tonight, right now. Whenever the order is given, just be ready. 'We'll begin operations exactly as practiced a hundred times.' We'll meet in 45 minutes. And from now on, don't forget for a second - that even while - We're just a part of an army this is the first platoon of Dog Company. The best. Hey. Hey, come on in. We're havin' a party. Have a drink. Hi, lieutenant. - Sergeant Forrest, put him back - Together and send him to see me. Get your gear together as quickly as you can. Yes, sir. - All I gotta say is, if this guy - Flies with us, I quit. This is a joke. Can't you take a joke? Have a drink. - Hey! - Listen, you're a no-good rush. - Let me get him. - Dreef, Dreef, come on. - Let me in, I know about him. - Dreef! Dreef! I'll handle him. Mason, I don't know how you're gonna do it. But you'll get cleaned up - and sober, and you'll do it - In 20 minutes. You'll fight this war from a stockade. Maybe you will, anyway. Look out. - Alright, let's get hot in here. - You guys, come on. Oh, come on, boy. Alright, strip. - Go on, get 'em off. - I don't wanna take a shower. Oh, I'd leave 'em on, and I don't care. Hey, it's cold! - I swear I never knew a boy could - Get hisself messed up like you. I had a jackass brighter than you. - Get on back in there - And listen here. I'm through backin' you up. - Remember, I said you was - Gettin' down the only friend? - Well, boy, you're gettin' close - To havin' none. - Zero! - Okay, buddy, buddy. Get in there. You know what you've done? - You messed up them guys' - Equipment, got 'em all upset. - Us gettin' fixin' to jump, - Maybe tonight. You hear me, you fool Yankee! This here could be D-Day. - I swear if I didn't mind - Bruisin' my knuckles - I'd pound a hole - In your thick skull so some sense could get in! - Then maybe - You'd understand you're not such an important big shot. - You're just in the army - Like anyone! - D-Day? - You're sure right. - Oh? - Yeah. - Why didn't they send us - Those replacements two weeks ago? Why do they always wait till there isn't enough time? It ain't reasonable, sir. - Sergeant, if the whole world - Were reasonable there wouldn't be any need for armies. You got a point there, sir. - Look, lieutenant, - You're not gonna let Mason jump with us, are you? Sir, there's no man in the squad that doesn't hate his guts. They don't hate him. What would you do? Jug him? In a minute, sir. - And yet when a mechanical device - Breaks down an expensive one, we don't throw it away we try and repair it if we can. - A man deserves - At least the same treatment as an expensive machine. I'm sorry, sir. Come in. Private Mason, sir. - How do you feel? - I'm okay, sir. - Mason, I'm not - Going to chew you out. Partly because there isn't time. I've got a lot to do and a lot to think about. - I just wanna know - One thing from you. Do you want in or do you want out? I want in, sir. - I have to make a decision - About you but I don't believe I should make it alone. I'm going to a higher authority. Sit down. I'll be right back. What's he mean, a higher authority? - Well, you look at me as if you - Thought I was nuts or somethin'. - Didn't you ever have to blow - Your top or anything? No, huh? Okay. I don't know. Perhaps you could say I believe in long shots. Perhaps every man in an untried situation is a long shot. All of us. Anyway, we need him. Now as I said, I'm not asking you for a decision. I'll make the decision. But I do wanna know how you feel. Can I say somethin', lieutenant? See, I've known Mason a long time. About three years. Sure, he's got thorns up his pants but I'll tell you one thing. - I'd sure hate to be the German - That meets up with him. I'd take him alongside me any old day. He ain't a bad guy. - Well, maybe - With a few Germans around he'd stop fightin' us. - I guess we can handle him, - Lieutenant. So he's nuts. Everybody's got a little somethin'. Let him go, lieutenant. I'll take care of him. Maybe we can use him. - You ever see him - Throw that knife? - Is that the consensus - Of opinion? - Yes. - Yes, sir. Alright, I'll go talk with him. If he sounds right, he'll be along. We'll be moving in less than 30 minutes. Team, hut! Boy, there goes a real honest to breathin' right guy. 'Dubrowski, eight.' 'Peterson, seven.' Talbot, six. Dreef. Five. Corliss. Four. Grimes. Three. Mason. Two. Lieutenant, you're number one, sir. Alright, fasten your seatbelts. - Remember, no smokin' - Till we get off the ground. - We're off now. - You can smoke if you want to. Alright, listen to me, you guys. We get the green light at 23:30. Move out fast. When your chute opens look up at the point and check your bearings. - Dreef, check the anchor line. - I did. - Well, check it again. - Right. - You okay, kid? - I'm okay. And I'm not a kid. I'm married. Okay. What's the matter, Forrest? I checked it. Peterson, you alright? Did you forget to take your airsick pills? - Oh, no. - Hey, stewardess. - Could you bring me a magazine? - Something sexy? What are you thinkin' about? Oh, I'm thinkin' about my draft board. - You know, I told them - When they drafted me - I had just taken - A three-year lease on a garage. I told them it was important. - My brother-in-law and me - Are partners, I said. - He's got a sore back - And can't run the place alone. I gotta be there. So? So.. So he's running it alone. - Looks like - Mason is still hungover. Yeah. I don't suppose you got a spittoon on ya? Now I know why they pay a man $50 a month extra for volunteering for this outfit. No place to spit. How's Mason? He's alright, sir. - Just thinkin' things over, - I reckon. He hasn't got too much time left to do it. Lenny? It was a good farm. Nobody ever tended it. Just grew all by itself. - Oh hot days, - We used to sit under an elm tree and drink cold cider. Yes, sir. Twelve kids. Every time one was born, pa ate his hat. Just chewed it right up. When ma died, he read out of the Bible to us for three straight days. Funny, the way he ate his hat every time one of us was born. Well, that was a good farm. I wish I was there now. You okay, boy? Yeah. Yeah. Alright. We got ten minutes to go. - Now remember, - When you get on the ground keep your rifles unloaded until daylight. Use bayonets and grenades. - We don't want you shooting - Everything that moves. So challenge first. Yeah, 'cause it might be your own mother. Alright, funny guy, you got your cricket? - Yeah. - Well, use it. One click for challenge. Two clicks for answer. Alright, let's have a review. - Okay, take your fingers - Out of your ears. The lieutenant wants to talk to you. Second battalion drop zone is 6 miles north of Carentan. Dubrowski, where do we land? - Our drop zone's a mile - Beyond the battalion, sir. - Our first assembly point - Will be the clump of trees - northwest corner - Of the drop zone. Then what, Mason? - Follow the hedgerow, - Make a way to the bridge set up roadblocks. - We meet the other two squads - At the stone bridge - beyond the mouth of the Douve - River. We hold the bridge. Show me the bridge. Right here, sir. Battalion ones hold bridges on the road to Utah Beach bottled up. On Omaha and Utah Beach, they'll be driving in a sand.. The Douve bridge is the key to the most important road. We take and hold it. Okay, that's it. - Mason? - Yes, sir. You got something on your mind? - Yes, sir, plenty. - So have I. I've got 42 men on my mind. This plane and two others. From now on, as of right now - you haven't got a problem - In the world except taking that bridge. Yes, sir. And everything else is forgotten. Yes, sir. We're over the coast, sir. Six minutes. Put your helmets on. - Hey, lieutenant! - Foley, hurry up. - My bag. - Here. Pull those ties out. - Tie them together... - No good, lieutenant. He's dead. - What's up? - We ought to be over - our drop zone now. - What's the matter? - I can't get - Any ground identification due to this undercast. No DC lights, no nothing. - We'll have to take - What we can get. - Tell the pilot - To give us the green. - Twenty seconds. - Yes, sir. Alright, get ready! Get on up and hook up. Check equipment. Call it out for equipment check. Fourteen, okay. - Thirteen, okay. - Twelve, okay. - Eleven, okay. - Ten, okay. - Nine, okay. - Eight, okay. Peterson, seven, keep goin'. - Six, okay. - Five, okay. - Four, okay. - Three, okay. Two, okay. Alright, standby, five seconds. Alright.. Hernandez. Spread out, you guys. - Delightful evening. - Splendid. Alright, let's hold it here. - Where's your hat? - Fell off when my chute opened. Keep quiet. It's okay. Come on. Hey, lieutenant, this ain't our drop zone. - I know. - We could be anywhere. - Could be in Holland - For all we know. - Or even on the way - To the bridge. Let's find out just where we are. - 'What do you think, sir?' - 'We landed south for sure.' - - 'We could be anywhere - In this area.' 'Let's try to find a landmark.' - You know, - I knew this was gonna happen. - Oh, yeah? - Oh, sure. - It always looks great on paper, - But once you get out here.. - I saw a river. - Maybe it's our river. Well, maybe it's the Rhine. Any idea, sir? One lucky break is we've got a river. Sure to be a bridge somewhere. - Once we find it, - We'll have a landmark. - 'Everyone checked his gear?' - 'Yes, sir.' unloaded until daylight.' 'Now remember, keep you rifles - 'We don't want you shooting - Everything that moves.' - It's getting so, a man can't - Find a place to spit no more. We might be in hearing distance Quiet! of the whole German army. Now listen, divide into three groups. Forrest, you move east away from the river. - Look for a house, road, - Anything. Dreef, you take north along the river. I'll move south. We'll go ten minutes out, ten minutes back. We'll meet here. - Remember that tree - With the shoot in it so you don't get lost. Whatever you find, don't try any fighting alone. - You got that? - We'll do our fighting together. Nolan, Grimes, Talbot, come with me. Smith, let's go. Lambert, Foley, Hernandez, 'Come on. Move out.' Okay, let's move. Let's take a closer look.' 'There's a bridge. - What's the matter? - I got a nail sticking through. Shut up, you guys. [men speaking - Our bridge? - I don't know. Doesn't seem quite right. Let's get back. There's only three of them. If we start back now, they may hear us. - We can take 'em now. - They don't expect a thing. You heard me, Mason. We're goin' back. Watch your feet. - You see, I tell you, - We ought to take 'em right now. I'll take 'em. - You start anything and I'll bust - Your jaw wide open. Now we're goin' back, one at a time. - That way if anything happens, - We can cover each other. Dubrowski, take off. Corliss. Now you. - And remember what I said. - Yeah. Mason, get going. Hey! Mason, you fathead. Okay, it's clear. Come on. - Dreef's been hit. - He's hurt bad. Dreef. Dreef! He ain't hearin' us. He's dead. - He's dead and you did it. - Me? He warned you, don't start anything. - Lieutenant told you. - Why'd you do it? - Do what? - There was a German getting... - Oh, shut up! - I don't wanna hear you try to lie your way out of it. - No, listen to me... - Shut up! We gotta get out of here. - There might be more of 'em - Around who'll hurt us. Get his tags, let's blow. - Get away! He wouldn't want you - Handlin' him. Come on in. Looks like you cleaned it out. - Alright, Nolan, - Get across the bridge. - Foley, take off up the road. - Smith, go on back down the road. What happened? I-I don't know exactly, sir. We just had to take 'em. - Well, come on. What happened? - How'd it get started? Tell him, Mason. - A sentry started to fire - At Dreef, sir, I threw my... Alright, I'll tell him. - Mason wanted to rush to bridge - And Dreef shut him up. - 'We separated so we could cover - Each other getting out.' - 'Corliss and me heard Dreef - Yell at Mason' 'then there was a shot.' Then the whole thing started. - Mason forced it - And now Dreef's dead. - And he wouldn't be if you hadn't - Wanted to be a hero. I knew you'd do it. I knew you'd foul us up! 'Alright, knock it off!' - I didn't. - 'We'll go into this later.' Sergeant, come with me. It's the La Fiere Bridge. Sergeant, your job isn't to punish Mason. It's to keep the group solidly together. Let's not be too quick to judge. Yes, sir. from our objective.' 'We're about 20 miles - - '20 miles?' - - 'Hm.' 'We're here.' 'We should be here at the Douve River bridge.' - 'We're gonna - Have to be careful.' 'Everyone of these farmhouses and villages up to the Douve' 'could be a German strongpoint.' We may run into the whole German army before we get there but we'll get there. What are you staring at me for? - You guys think - I wanted Dreef to die? - Maybe you just don't care - One way or the other. Anyone except you. - I heard you say you could take - The bridge all by yourself. You're so big and important. - I tell you, there was a sentry - Aimin' right at Dreef and I threw my knife. - The sentry's gun went off, - Not mine. - This is the last time I'm gonna - Tell ya. I had to do it. I said knock it off! Come over here. Now listen, all of you. - From now on, - This is all in my hands. I'll make the judgment about Mason, not you. I want no more of this. - 'Corliss.' - 'Yes, sir.' - 'Dubrowski, you understand?' - 'Yes, sir.' - - 'This is a unit, - It will stay a unit.' Lieutenant, look out! Lieutenant, you alright? I.. - Let me see. - I can't see. Yeah, it's flash burns. You'll be alright, sir. - Just take it easy, sir. - It's your party now, sergeant. We have 20 miles to go. If there's trouble, just park me somewhere and get out of it. - Get to the Douve bridge - With or without me. - Look, lieutenant... - That's an order, sergeant! Yes, sir. Don't you wanna rest for a little while, sir? - I'll tell you if I need it. - Yes, sir. Take off, sergeant! Okay. - Alright, push off. - Dubrowski, take the point. - Mason. - Yes, sir. I.. I need someone to guide me. Yes, sir. If anything happens to him.. I'll cut you in half. - Mason! - Yes, sir. Wait a minute, lieutenant. I gotta get my knife. Okay, sir. Let's go. Here. - Mason? - Yes, sir. Thanks. - A German Luger - Was pointing at my head. It's funny, I can still see it. - I guess it was the last thing - I saw. Yeah. Come on, sir. Sir? What is it? - Look, sir, maybe - You don't like me any better - than the rest of 'em, - But I wish you'd believe me. I want you to believe me. I wasn't to blame. - It isn't so hard to believe. - Yeah, but I thought... As for my not liking you, that's isn't true. None of these men dislike you. - Just before we left, - You remember - I consulted what they call - The higher authority? Yes, sir. That was the members of your squad. They were all for you. - That isn't so hard - To believe either, is it? Unless you wanna think badly of yourself. Okay, sir. I got it. Come on. There's no sign of life, but I don't like it. Kind of a pretty little place. - It looks alright, lieutenant, - But I can't tell for sure. - Better send two men scouting. - Yes, sir. Grimes, Lambert. Take that hedgerow over there. See what's there. Signal if it's all clear. - Well, that's what you get - For volunteering. Cover me. - Stand by here - Until I give you the wave on. - Well, what's the scoop? - They got Lambert. - How many of them are there? - I don't know. - They got - One machine gun... so far. Well, let's take a look. - I bet you don't believe - In wet paint signs either. - Alright, - We'll use smoke grenades. Dubrowski and Talbot are on the side. - There's nobody out back. - Check everything. Rooms, cellar.. Sorry to interrupt you, buddy. Let go of her. You can say that again. Alright, frisk him, Foley. Etes vous American? Sure, what'd you expect? - Of course, we're Americans. - He's clean, sarge. Alright, get her too. - Now take it easy. - Nobody's gonna hurt you. Well, she's okay too, sarge. I said search her, Foley. Right. Excuse me. Alright! Alright! Wait till lieutenant gets here. Alright, Foley, cover him. No talkin'. Nothin'. What is it? It's Sergeant Forrest, sir. - We cleaned out the joint, - Lieutenant. Is everything alright? Lambert, Nolan.. Hernandez. Yeah. What else? - Well, we captured - One of the Germans. - He's inside - With a, with a French girl. Let's go have a look.. Let's go talk, talk with them. Yes, sir. Alright, keep a watch out. He's inside, sir. Up, sir. In here, lieutenant. - Where are we? - Inside the bedroom, sir. Chair, sir. - Oh, the girl is here? - Yes, sir. - Well, let's see - How my French has stood up. - Mademoiselle. - Oui, monsieur. - She says - The Germans came yesterday and killed her father and mother. She sounds alright. - How does she look? - Ah, pretty mad, sir. I don't think she's fakin' it. - Well, let's see - About the German. - Does he speak English? - I don't think so, sir. That's too bad. I don't speak German. - Let's see, - Maybe the girl can tell us - how many more Germans - There are. - Nothing but Germans - As far as the eye can see. Marianne, es que vous parle Allemand? - Oui, monsieur. - Oh, good. - Now we're getting somewhere. - She can speak German. - I'm going to have her - Interrogate the prisoner for us. - Now watch him. - If he lies, he'll be shot. I'll tell the girl to tell him that. Well? - Yeah, - I think he understands her. - Don't let anyone touch it. - Foley! Don't touch it! - Don't touch it! - Well, someone's gotta get it. - We don't answer, - We'll have Germans all over us. - Sergeant, - I'm going to tell Marianne to order the prisoner to answer it. - He'll say everything's alright, - She'll listen. - If he tries anything, - Shoot him. - Keep him scared. - Yes, sir. - Marianne, come on, you.. - Alright, come on. Los. Come on! Mason, start him. Come on. Come on. Alright. Come on. Come on. Los! - Keep him scared, Forrest. - Yes, sir. Los. Ca va. It's okay. - - Say, lieutenant, what do you - Think our chances are? - From what Marianne - And the prisoner have told me there's about 300 Germans between us and Douve River. - Their headquarters - Is in the village a few miles down the road. - Most of the army has bivouacked - A mile or so beyond. They're going to move tonight towards the Douve River and attack the Americans there. That means part of our company got there at least. - So far, - The Germans don't know about us. What's going on? Uh, she wants to do your bandage, lieutenant. Oh. Merci. - That phone call was to say - That they're sending a truck - to pick up the men - That were stationed here. Well, that's one problem, we've got more. - Not only do we - Have to get through we have to do it before the Germans move. - Maybe possible for some of us - To get through. - But not if I'm along. - Oh, now, wait... - - 'There's isn't time - To try to lead' - a blind man - Through enemy lines. - Look, lieutenant, we're not - Gonna leave you behind. You will if I say so, sergeant. - Voila. - Merci. Now, probably when the truck comes, we can take it. It's just an outside possibility - that we can use it - for something more - Than getting to the river. - Yeah, but I'm probably... - Wait a minute, sir. - Truck coming! - Okay. Out of sight, everybody. - Take over, sergeant. - Yes, sir. Alright. - Corliss, Dubrowski, Grimes, - Run back to the wall. Block him off when he comes in. - Right. - Mason, Talbot, with me. Hey. Hans, are you there? Hans.. f Alright, let's get the truck. - Everything alright, kid? - Sure. - She's got everything - Under control. - This idea works, - We'll all go down in history. And if it doesn't, we'll just go down. - Marianne's got 'em - Rehearsed enough. - Just watch everything he does - After we get in there. Yes, sir. - You know, sir, - This plan of yours reminds me - of a story I read once - About a, about a Trojan horse. You ever read it? - Oddly enough, that's how - I happen to think of it. Now remember, if it doesn't look good around headquarters we go right on through town. Yes, sir. I got it. - We're coming into town. - Alright. Everybody know what to do? Standby. Final order is, there's trouble, don't stop for me. - Everything ready, sergeant? - Yes, sir. We're goin' through. Soldat. Alright. Sentries in, sir. - You know Marianne's description - Of the tavern. - You know from the driver - How many are there. - Get going! - Yes, sir. - Mason, you stay here - With the lieutenant. - Get those two guys in here - And guard 'em all. Hey. Kraut, come on. Alright, everybody up! Don't try.. Foley, go upstairs! - Dubrowski, that should be - The cellar. Check. - Go, hurry up. Come on, Marie, - Talk to 'em. Tell 'em! Come on, move. Frisk everybody. Come on! Come on! Move it up! Shut up! Come on! Move! Move! So far, so good. - Alright, Dub, - Keep an eye on that cellar door. Foley, go on, watch out back. Corliss, Talbot, go out front - bring in the lieutenant - And the prisoners. Right. Alright, let's clean up this place. You can come on in, sir. - You two, come on. - Hey, what about me? - Stay here, - And keep your eyes open. - We need a man on guard, Mason. - Good one. Come on, sir. Step up. Up, up again, sir. Here's a chair. Here. Sit down. Oh. Is everything alright? - Yes, sir. Not a hitch. - Well, what do you know? - Better get those Germans - Out of the truck. - Yes, sir. - Keep Mason on guard outside. - Do we have security out back? - Yes, sir. Foley's out there. Fine. Alright. Keep an eye on lover boy here. - Communication's are ready. - Yes, sir. He's here. - We need some late orders - To check by. - There's a lot of paper around, - Sir. Marianne's lookin' through 'em. Oh, good. - We've got to have a code number - Or they'll never believe us. Come on, hurry up. Everybody, quiet now. He knows what to say. He's quoted it by heart 17 times. Change of orders of the 38th Panzergrenadiers. - Set them moving - Towards the Douve River - they'll go - In the opposite direction. - Now watch Marianne. - If she signals, shoot him. - And we get out of here fast. - You got that, sergeant? - Yes, sir. - Alright. - Marianne? - Oui, monsieur. No answer. We got us a real joker here. He didn't turn the switch on. Just one more little gag, Happy Sam. Oh. He thinks we'll kill him, anyway. - Everybody, - Shake your heads at him. Parfaite. Perfect. Now they'll turn around and walk right into the whole allied advance. Hey, look at him. He's laughing. Try this on for size. - Oh, man. - These are gonna be real good. - Lieutenant, you suppose - We can sweat out the rest of the war right here? - Oh, we'll give him - About a half hour to move. - Then we'll try and use - The truck to get through. - Cigarette, lieutenant. - Thanks. Hmm. I remember a verse from a long time ago. "Lo, we've dreamed on slavery "and we've dreamed on kings and still we dream of decency and the end of evil things." - You know, I-I, I never - Asked you before, lieutenant but, uh, what do you used to do? I was a school teacher. It never occurred to me that I'd be out here doing this. Now it hardly seems likely I'll ever be a school teacher again. - Ah, you're gonna be alright, - Lieutenant. - We'll get your eyes - Fixed up for ya. I wasn't thinking of that. I was thinking.. I'm not the same man. Are you the same, sergeant? I don't remember. I don't know. I was a fireman. It was a long time ago. - I'm tellin' you, - These things are killin' me. - Why didn't you get another pair - Before you left? - I did. That's what's wrong. - What's wrong? - There's a nail stickin' through - Just like the other pair. - Let me see. - See it? - Yeah. Why don't you take - Your, take your knife and bend it over or something? 'I tried it. I tried it.' 'It just didn't work.' - 'There must be another way - Of getting it out.' Hey, back off the racket. Why? Did anyone lose a foot? who needs shoes like this?' 'I'm walking on blood, - - 'You see the chaplain, that - Will tell you all about it.' Merci. What time is it? Uh, it's 14:20, sir. Pretty soon now. Excusez moi. He's turned on the set! Hold it! Hold it! - They've probably heard us - By now. Let's get out of here. - Here they come, boys. - Out the back. - Alright, get movin'. - Pick up Foley on the way by. Grimes! - Hell, it's nothing - Like a smooth war. - Grab her before - She shakes them off again! Tell her she's crazy! - There's another wall, sir. - Now we're goin' over it. - Mason, where are the others? - Took off. - Come on, we can't stay here. - Well, take off yourself. - Come on, get out. - Come on, sir! - Do what I tell ya, you... - Yes, sir. - You gotta be careful - Jumpin' down like that, man. - You could get killed. - You alright? Yeah. They got Smith. - You got a point there, - But I don't know what it is. - Well, I know where - I'm not wanted. Let's go. Yeah. Wait here, sir. Okay, sir. Watch your head, sir. There's a chair, sir. Easy. - Okay? - Yeah. - Well, this won't do us for long. - They'll be in here quicker... - Well, why don't you - Get on your scooter and hightail it out of here? Yeah. - Like the rest of the team - Who ran out on you, huh? - Is that what you think? - That's sure what I think. - Survival of the fittest, - They call it. - Where's lieutenant? - Mason's with him. - Where? - Around the other way. Ready? Let's go. Grenade! - They stopped shooting. - Yes, sir. And I don't see a thing. If it was up to you which idea would you accept? Survival of the fittest - or fitting as many as possible - To survive? - Are you just gonna sit there - And talk about life and stuff while these jokers are movin' in on us? It's a good moment to talk about life. I don't think I've ever seen it as clearly as I do now. Stay still. Don't move. Mason. Mason! - 'Mason!' - I'm okay, sir. It's okay. Come on, sir. Well, that about does it. They'll be rushin' us now. - It's too bad we're never gonna - Have a chance to go out and get drunk together, talk about life. - We've had it. - No, not yet. - You're gonna die - Believing in your team. - They're not comin' back, - I tell you. We're stuck, lieutenant. - Your team ran out on you - And we're stuck.. Alright, good job. Hey, Mason! 'Lieutenant! Mason!' You wanna answer that, Mason? Here they are. - Are you guys alright? - Yeah. - Hi, boy. - I thought you got lost. - Hey, sarge? - Yeah! - Guard that door. Grimes - And me will get the truck. - And hurry up, will you, before - We meet the whole German army? - Alright. - I think Mason's wounded. I thought you had all gone. - I thought you'd gone. - Gone? My, boy, you was in a jam. Here's your knife. Come on, come on! Come on, come on! Get in! Go ahead! Talbot, sir. Talbot. Smith. Foley. 'Nolan.' Lambert. Hernandez. Torren. Peterson. Dreef. "No man is an island entire to itself. "Every man is a piece of the continent "a part of the main. "Any man's death diminishes me.. because I am involved in mankind." Ah, we're okay now. - There's somethin' about - Me and the truck, Grimes. - We understand each other. - Yeah? - Just remember that more guys - Get knocked off in cars - than in wars. - So don't get fancy. Relax, will ya? I told you trucks and me understand each other. Yeah. Can this thing go any faster? Sure, she's got a lot more. Well, barrel it. Yeah, I love you, too, baby. Yeah, you can say that again. - Even I can understand. - Are you goof? She's sayin' watch the road! Dubrowski, watch out! - What are you trying to do, - You ape? The brakes went out! How far is it, lieutenant? Other side of the hill. You and your trucks. - I thought you said - You understood each other? Oh, lay off, will you, Grimes? I told you the brakes went out. Hold! Forrest. - Where have you guys been, - Anyway? Went out looking at real estate. - Where's the Duove? - Around the bend. What'd you guys do? Get lost or somethin'? Alright, don't talk. Well... we're here. - Doesn't look like - Our platoon encountered - what anyone would call - Resistance. Well, no flag's wavin', no horn's blowin'. I guess the war is still on. - Hi, Forrest. - Where you guys been? What you been doin'? I thought I told you to wait in the car. - Come on, Dubs. - Funny. Don't even talk to him. - What happened to ya? - Fifteen hours we've been here. We got the road and the bridge and the war's already someplace else. - Is that Sergeant Eicher? - Yes, sir. - The other two squad's here? - Three men still missin', sir. - And we've been alerted - To move on. Where's the company CP? - Over at Saint-Come-du-Mont, - Lieutenant. I'm sure glad to see ya. We gave you up. Just missed our DZ, that's all. Ran into a few foreigners. Hey, anybody got a cigar? - Where do you think you are? - Coney Island? 20-11 miles, you go through a whole German army get shot at, blowed up, knocked down and cranked flat. - There ain't even a cigar - Waitin' for ya. Settle for a cigarette? Sure. - I'll tell you one thing, - I better get a new pair of shoes or I'll resign. - We're moving up. All positions - Are secured to this point. You are to rejoin the company. - CP is 9 miles up to - Saint-Come-du-Mont, you got it? - Yes, sir. Any transportation? - No. - Lieutenant Pauling is here, sir, - With five men. - Major Carter. - Pauling. Yes, lieutenant. First platoon, Dog Company - reporting nine men - Out of action.
