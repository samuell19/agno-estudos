You're gonna be all right, Faith. We're here, baby. Wake up, now. Faith? Wake up, Faith. Hang on! I'm comin'. Here we go! Okay, baby, I'll get you out. I'll get you out, Faith. Faith, stay with me. Somebody help me, help me! Somebody help me, please! Help me! You, stop! Okay, sir, set her down. Help me! Her name is Faith. Sir, you have to move. I told her to buckle! Doctor, have you seen Dr. Raleigh? Dr. Raleigh's in a code. I'll take care of it. Kids, you wait for Daddy right there, okay? But your wife's having a baby! You shouldn't be here. No, no, just one floor up, I've got plenty of time. Tell me what happened, sir. We got cut off. Went off the road, hit a ditch. - BP is 90 over 60, pulse 135. - I don't really remember. I don't really know what happened! Get her to radiology right now. I want a head and a neck CT, stat. Go, go, go! What? No, wait, I got to go. I got to be with her! Security! Sir, how much alcohol have you had today? - Hmm? - Wait, what? Security, keep him here. Please, keep him here. I got to go with her, that's my daughter! Your daughter's safe in my hand. I will take care of her, all right? That's my Faith, I have to go with them! I have to go with them! - No! - I have to go with her! Did you leave the scene of an accident? My daughter's hurt back there and I need to be there. No, hey, if you don't calm down, I will put these on you. Look, I don't have time for this! Faith! - Back off! - Hey! - Back off! - Hey, hey, hey! You pull that trigger and you will never see your daughter again. You won't see tomorrow unless I see my Faith. Give me the gun now! Waiting room, code silver. Look around you. Look how you're freaking out the kids. Think of your little girl, Faith, right? What would Faith want you to do? She's all I got. I can't lose her. I can't lose my Faith. That's my Faith. You can't take her. You can't take her! Ooh, that one. Did you find your dress yet? No way, mister. The first time you're gonna see me in my wedding dress is when I'm walking down the aisle. Oh, okay. It's really not fair, though. Why do you get to see my tux but... - Hey. - Are you gonna cry? Remember when we were like that? Hey, we still are. Now the student should never dishonor his teacher. Hmm. Hmm. Mm, ah, yeah, that's a great move. Oh, even better. It's getting worse. Cities, all due to the collapse of the dollar, and the panic, looting, and governmental chaos that followed. The National Guard and local responders are overwhelmed in the bigger metropolitan areas. Smaller towns and rural I can't concentrate. Is Eli spanking you at chess again? No, Eli is not spanking me at chess again. Mom said it's party time, Birthday Boy. Jimmy? I'm coming. Perfect storm, the mass layoffs at the Zanesville plant which sparked riots over the weekend escalated sharply this morning. Police are advising people to stay in for their own health. Oh, I wanted that. Okay, what's it gonna be, cake or presents? - Presents! - Presents! - Presents! - Presents! - Presents. - Presents, it is. I'm starting first. Here ya go. Ooh! Whoa! Happy birthday, son. Oh! - Whoa! - Whoa! How could you get him that? You knew about this? I'm sorry, I didn't get a chance to talk to her about it. Well, how could, ah. Sophie, please don't ruin this for Jimmy. Look, we are gonna be safe, Sophie, all right? Safety lessons first. Yeah? You know I'm a better shot than you anyways, Dad. On their birthday, no less. What do you say we go to the range and shoot this thing, huh? I wanna come. No, no, no, it's just Jimmy and Adam today, okay, buddy? Okay. All right, well, we'll go into town and pick up some ammo on the way. Come on, let's go. It'll be fun. Love you. Bye. Have fun. More cake for us. Oh yeah. On his 21st birthday? Sophie, you humiliated him. I'm sorry I didn't warn you. You know how your father can be sometimes. Sometimes he can't see outside his own two rules. Be prepared. Mmhmm, and? That'll be fun. Yep. It'll never be boring being hitched to men like ours. That's for sure. Sometimes I prefer boring. Mm. How in the world did you get through this, Mom? We all miss Becca. But no one as much as Jimmy. Why can't I let things go? You just want to protect the ones you love. Come on. Buttercream frosting is calling our names. - Okay? - Okay. So, what was that about? I'm sorry that happened, Adam. Let's just say that forgiving and forgetting isn't one of Sophie's strong points. You can say that again. - Jimmy? - What? It's true. Marriage isn't always gonna be easy. There are gonna be moments that you wonder why you chose Sophie, and, well, she's gonna wonder why she chose you. When you reach that point, just remember your vows. Yes sir, for better or for worse. Love is a, it's a sacrifice. It's laying down your life for her. Oh, and I'm really sorry that she decided to postpone the wedding for a year. Well, wait, what? She didn't tell you? Ah. Sorry. Look. I'm just kidding. Oh, man, oh, oh! You were in on it too. Okay, okay, I see how it is. Whoa, whoa, whoa! So much for chaos staying in the big cities. Well, they look peaceful. Let's hope they stay that way. There you go. - Hi. - Hi. Keep 'em out, Chuck. Our credit card machine's down. It's been down all day. Let us in! I'm sorry, we're closing early today. Last sale, get the weapons in the safe now. Please leave peacefully and quietly out the back doors. Stay safe. We can't hold 'em! Cash to my office now. Okay. Look out! No, hey, let go! Protect the people, not the property, Tim. Come on, let's go! Go, go, go! Hey! Hey! Leave us alone! Back off! You help Jimmy. Jimmy! I said back off! - I got him. - Hey! Come on, come on! Hey! Who are you kidding? You can't shoot us all! You really want to take that chance? You ain't goin' anywhere! You're mine! Give it to me, come on, give it to me! Uh-oh. Hold on! All right, come on, Liz, pick up. Pick up! What's happening? Downtown's under attack, people are getting killed. Are you hurt? No, I'm fine, I'm fine, but we have to get outta here. Dad, what happened? He got knocked out. Look, we'll talk about it later. Right now, we need to leave. Leave? The whole town's on fire. The police are retreating. Go get him an ice pack and some Ibuprofen, now. Okay, okay. Whose blood is in the back seat? What? It's someone we tried to help. Now listen to me very carefully. We have prepared for this. We will survive, but right now, we have to pack and get outta here. How long are we gonna be gone? What? I'm supposed to be getting married in 39 days, Dad. Sophie, have you heard a word I've said? People are dying just two miles away. My priority is to keep you all safe. - Safe? - Yes, safe. Adam, do you want to stay with us until your family gets back in town? All right, all right, guys, we've prepared. Let's go, let's do this, let's pack it up, let's go! Hey, Honey, have you seen the key to the gun safe? It should be in your drawer. No, it's not there. Get everyone in the car! Can I go back inside and get my box? No, bugout gear only. - Dad, but it's my... - I said no! Do you know where the bronze key to the gun safe is? No. Honey. Honey, can we just stay here? Maybe we're overreacting just a- That was in our neighborhood. Get everyone in the car. Eli, move it, time to leave. Where's Jimmy? Jimmy! Go, go, go! Adam, grab that rifle. Shells are in the trailer. We will defend ourselves! Sophie, take the kids and get outta here! What? You guys, go, go, go, go! Stay low! Eli, stay low. Get off my property, now! All right, Doc. Time for you to feel my pain. There are kids here. Where are ya? Show yourself. What, what? Faith? That can't be. No dead kids, Clint, just the doctor. Daddy! Sophie, go, go, get outta here! Dad! Hey! Sophie, get to the woods. - Jimmy, go! - Okay. We'll meet you there! Girls, grab a bag. Adam, I have to find that key. Come on, Sophie! Not without Adam. Faith! No! Why, I just told you... It wasn't me! I said, it wasn't me! Don't be going all tender on us. This was your idea. She's gonna die anyway. Come on. Take care of 'em, Soph. Run! Jack! Hey Jack, found me a wife. Get off of me! Oh, no, no, no. Sit down. Why are you doing this to us? It's vengeance. Easy, easy. But it's over now. The world is falling apart. Believe me, I need to save those kids, though I'm only gonna offer this once. Help me save her. You can't have her. Fine, we're done. You can't have her! You hear me? You can't have her! So, you can help- or you could hurt. Hmm. He's your problem now. Oh, one more thing. If I don't find her alive, I'm gonna find you. How's that for tender? Eli, come on, get up. You don't have to hide it from me. What? You've stared at that thing every spare second for the past month, whenever you think no one's looking. Has it really been a month? You can talk to me, you know that? It's your turn. Mommy. Shh. Mommy! Mommy, no! Look, you have got keep Faith more quiet. Look, she's been whining all night long. Have a heart, Jimmy. Her wound is infected and she misses Mom. You shouldn't have gone back into the house to get your stupid ole' sword. We could have got out in time. I told you that Dad said that I could go back. Please keep your voice down. No, you went back inside to get your dumb toy sword and your little trinkets when his last words were for everybody to get in the car and leave. You think you miss him more than me? I'll take the lookout. But you did it last night. How are you gonna stay awake? Let it go, Soph. We are still a family. Yep. Mommy. Good morning, sleepyhead. That's what Mom used to say to me when I'd sleep in. Scooch. Six berries and one piece of jerky for each of us. Here, bud. These berries are sour. Eli, you're always wanting what we don't have. Be thankful and try it. It's not that bad. Don't spit that out. Eli, when God made the first deer, He said, "It is good." That was before Adam and Eve sinned. Now it's disgusting. I hate it. In everything, give thanks, for this is the will of God. Think so, huh? You think God wants us to give thanks for everything? What about stinging nettles? I'll get you some jewel weed. It's not for everything give thanks, "In everything, give thanks." Yeah. God, thank you so much for thinkin' of us and for thinkin' of Faith, whom You could cure with a snap of Your fingers like that. Grows right next to stingin' nettles. Ain't that just like God? I saw two flashlights on that hill last night. There's been no gunfire for two days. Maybe the looters couldn't break into the gun safe. Well, how can we get in without the key? No way, we are not going back there. Did you hear what I said? No gunfire for two days, we're fine. Her fever's back. We really need an antibiotic for her. Dad kept some in the house, right? We could use a bigger pan to boil water. Clothes, towels, anything for a bandage for Faith. We need to bury Mom and Dad. Stay here. Maybe the horses got out. Yeah, right. Let's go. Okay, here we go. Adam. Ugh, what is that smell? Shh, stay close. Did you hear that? No. Ah! It's a skunk. You about gave me a heart attack. Come on. Okay, you go check the basement first. I need to go upstairs and look for something. Sophie, we need to stay together. You hid the key to the gun safe? How dare you. I am so sorry. Ew. Watch your step. No, you watch your step. It's not Adam. Calm down, Soph. Ah. What is that? Shoo, go on. Here, hold the light. Oh, I can't believe it. Nice. Look, why don't we just stay here? We'll clean the place up. We'll bury the dead guy. They'll be back. We can defend ourselves now, Sophie. We don't have water, Jimmy. They will starve us out or burn us down. It's our home! Dad died fighting for it. We should be willing to. Dad didn't die fighting for our home. He died fighting for us. Handicapped, thanks to you. Okay. I am sick of hiding and eating berries and bugs, Sophie. Don't you wanna fight? If we die, who's gonna take care of Eli and Faith? Mom and Adam aren't here. Well, they could still be alive. Well, I wouldn't be too happy about that. Don't you dare talk like that around Faith. You know, some things are worse than death. People are coming. It's Robby. Wait, we don't know who he's with. It's Robby, Sophie. Robby! Jimmy. Man, I can't believe you guys made it. Hey, this is my buddy, Chris, okay? Well, come in and keep your voices down. Looters have been living here and they may be returning. Sophie! Adam! Oh, thank God! You're all right. So are you. You're alive. Sophie, I'm so sorry about your dad. Who's he? Robby? Look, Jimmy, just calm down, okay? He's with me. Is Mom all right? I don't know what happened to her. I ran out of ammo and they took us. Who took her? Where? We'll find her. Robby has an idea. All right, take us to her. Look, y'all don't understand, okay? You don't know what it's like out there. Try me. Like that. Everywhere. What is the government doing? Are there any police? Oh no, are you injured? Adam, what happened? What you got down in the duffle bag? Hey, get your hands off! And no you can't have any so don't even ask. Whose blood is this? Adam, what's going on? Don't judge us. Our parents were killed just like yours. Okay, we have to do what we have to do to survive. Are you hurting people? You aiming that weapon at me, boy? - Yeah. - Hey, Clint, look! These are my friends, okay? Look, everybody just needs to calm down, okay? Jimmy, calm down. Is that Charlie? Look, Adam, come on, let's go. No, I'm not leaving. Let me borrow your shotgun. No way. Here, I want it back. Good luck. Does that nasty hat look familiar to you, Soph? What caliber is that rifle over there? Fetch that rifle on the island for me. I got a feeling you ain't meaning to show it to me in a friendly way. Well, I got to feeling this ain't the first time you've been to my house. Adam, what's going on up there? Adam! Come on, let me in! No, you'll shoot Adam! Adam! Robby! He ain't gonna make it, Robby! Robby, help! I'm trying! Adam, just open the door! Time to die, boy. Ah! Adam, hurry, come on! Adam! Hey, get away from him! Robby! I'll kill you! Yep, whooped him. Adam. Took you long enough. Who was it? Hey, can you doctor that? Put pressure on it, put pressure on it. Lemme give 'em some food, Robby. They're hungry. We don't want your food, not if it has innocent blood on it. So you'd rather starve to death? Than murder and steal? Yeah. We only kill those who've killed to steal from others. Except that, uh, that little boy you shot. That boy wasn't so little, and he was coming at me with a knife. It was self-defense. When you're robbing someone, you don't have the right to shoot them in self-defense, Adam. Thanks, moron. Look, Soph, your little family dream of three meals a day and kids and bedtime prayers and that rose-decorated wedding at the country club? Soph, it's over. Welcome to our worst nightmare. It's adapt or die. You adapt by trusting in God, not by theft and violence. Did trusting God save your dad? Is trusting in God getting you fed? We're not starving. Yet. Jimmy, come eat with us. You've changed, Robby. I've grown up, Soph. Maybe if you'd trade that gavel for a fork, you might live long enough to grow up, too. Grow up somewhere else. Sophie's right, Robby. We've got blood on our hands. Shut up, ya little girl. Adam's not going anywhere. He's gonna have to stay here 'til he gets better, or at least 'til he stops bleeding. Is that all right? No, that's not all right! Leave! He got cut defending you all, you know. He didn't have to. Let me leave food for them in the mailbox in a week. Pathetic, you're all pathetic. Move! We'll tend to him until he's on his feet. Then he's outta here. Look, y'all are more than welcome to join us. You know where to find us. Bring your guns and your appetite. Hey, you'd better watch out for Clint. I wish, I wish someone would say something nice. Dad's happy. Rejoice with those who rejoice, right? Dad's not looking up at us. He's looking down on us. He wouldn't want us sad for long. When our old green go-kart broke, were you sad? Not really, no. Why? Because we knew Dad was gonna buy us a new one. With Dad, everything is brand new now. If he could tell us one thing, he would tell us that God is still good. It's okay to cry. Jesus told his disciples to buy a sword just for selfdefense. Two of 'em. I just don't understand your aversion to defending yourself. I am against killing people, and guns kill people. And that's why the bad guys shouldn't be the only ones to have 'em. It is not murder to kill someone in self-defense. You're being stricter than God. And it wasn't up to you anyway because Dad was looking for that key and you stole it. I was gonna give it back. Yeah, well, it's a little late, don't you think? Aren't you glad I'll be in the lookout with this? Or would you rather us be defenseless against the predators? I'm sorry, all right? Please, forgive me AnnaLee. Of course I forgive you. Now get some sleep. Sophie? Why am I shivering? Because your fever's breaking, or maybe it's withdrawals. Can I have some of the antibiotic? That's for Faith, and we barely have enough for her. Sorry, that was selfish of me. All right, give me the spear. I want both of you to drive any deer you see up to the ravine, okay? Why don't you just shoot 'em? Well, we got to save our ammo in case any bad guys come around, and we're too close to town. So I'm gonna crawl up on this log and perch up, and like I said, if you see anything, drive 'em this way, okay? Oh, oh my, yes! Yeah, right? Woo! Woo, we're eatin' tonight! Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you, Jimmy, so much. Thank you. It's really good, right? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. You know what? I think this deserves a toast, mm-hmm. Oh. - Go on. - Ready? To luxury. To luxury! - Woo-hoo! - Woo! That was the best meal we've had. For once, the kids won't go to bed hungry. Thank God. I see you're getting more comfortable with guns. Only because I have to. And with me. Sophie, I... You know I still feel the same way about you. You're still wearing the ring, which means you haven't completely given up on us, our dreams. My dream, Adam, was to marry a man who would be a good husband, a good father. I know, I know. A man who would do good when no one was looking, not a murderer, not a thief. Joining Robby was the best chance I had of finding your mom, the best chance, Sophie. And we were starving. I'm not justifying what I did. I'm sorry. What else can I do? You know what today is, don't you? It's the day I would've seen you in this. Sophie. Just-give me another chance. Please. I don't know how to let go, Daddy. I miss you so much. Tell Becca... Tell Becca that I miss her, too. Sophie, I found something. Oh yeah, it's a pendant. It's got the letter Y. You because it's my gift to you. Junk, Faith. If anything, all these luxuries are a waste of our time. They're not keepin' us alive. Like your box? Don't hurt his feelings, Sophie. Well, nice shootin', Tex. We'd starve to death on your lousy aim. You didn't hit one. Must be bad ammo. Oh, bad ammo? Listen to him. I'm nearly out. Well, those kids out there got guns and ammo, .308, 5.56, and I know he's got a camouflage Venture with a high-end scope. - Yeah. - Come on, man! Easy prey! Yeah, you're right. Sophie. If I tell you to go to Jimmy, you run and you don't look back. Do you understand me? Yes. Let's go. Hey, keep up. All right, now what is this? The safety? Safety, right, so when you click that down, you're gonna see this red dot. Okay. Now, what's this? Um, it's the, um, the slide. Right. If the slide's back, insert a fresh mag, and you're back in the fight. Frankie approached the petting zoo. He watched goats petting the people. He visited the chimps. They weren't grooming in the way he had expected. They were giving manicures, pedicures, and permanents. Look at his hair. I can't believe Robby would turn on you like that. I smelled the alcohol on him from 20 feet away. He had that guy that was with you when you came to the house, the fellow with the cowboy hat. Ah, he's a bad dude, no conscience. Did he attack us on that first day? Mm, after they beat me senseless, he still wanted to kill me, hang me from the tree over your dad. Robby came along just in time to save me. No, I take that back. Robby was just killing me slower. Glad you finally came to grips with that. All right, I want you to put your finger on the trigger, pull it back very slowly while keeping your sights fixed on the heart. All right. Can I just shoot his leg? No, you shoot to kill or you don't shoot. You shoot to defend, but shooting the leg of an armed man isn't a very good way to defend. Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. I'm gonna go for a walk. Hey, at least bring a gun with you. Oh, you are armed and dangerous. You ain't seen nothin' yet. Whoa! All right, take it off safety first, pull the trigger very slowly. You keep your sights fixed on the heart. Okay. Now shoot him. You got to take it off safety. Whoops. Eli, you can't forget. Finger off the trigger, hand it to me safely. Eli, it's a BarrelBuddy, once and done, kiddo. Oh, okay. Here you go. All right. You made that look easy. Hmm, you did pretty good. You know what, though? That right there is the most beautiful sound in the world. No, the ding of a microwave when the popcorn just finished. Yeah, or a burp. After a rootbeer float, it's awesome. "Amazing Grace" in fourpart harmony, that's the most beautiful sound in the world. Oh, you're so spiritual. Right? We could really bust some bad guys with that kinda grace, huh? Enough foolishness, please. You know, speaking of foolishness, I got a question for ya. When the looters run out of food and wood for their heat, where do you think they're gonna go? What's your point? It's a mathematical equation. We can't stay here, we don't have any food here. We've got more wire. We'll just set up more traps further away. Yeah, well, what if the crooks see one of my traps and decide to wait me out and ambush me? Or worse, follow me back here? Fact is, we can't garden and we can't raise livestock. We've got to keep moving, that's a fact. Well, what do you think we should do? No-brainer, we got to meet up with Robby in the city to find food. No way, Robby is bad news. Those who live by the sword will die by it. Precisely, and that's why it's better to die fighting than it is to die slowly starving or getting nabbed by, like, an armed gang. Look, don't you want to catch the people that did this to us? Is that what this is about? Punishing crimes is not our job. It's the government's. Look around you! What government? Look, we got to go. Who's with me? No, this is not a democracy. We're not splitting up. Adam said food from killing and stealing was worse than starving. Yeah, that's easy to say when you have a full stomach. Mom told us we should stay here, so that's what we should do. Mom is probably dead, Faith! - Jimmy! - Jimmy! And our best chance of finding her is with Robby! Oh, all of the evil things that are done in the name of good. We are staying here. We are staying together, and we are trusting God. Well, you can trust God all you want. Dad's the one who left us supplies and weapons. Not God. Eli, let's go check the traps. What's the matter with him? Wish you would have been here. He's hard to handle when you're not around. Nice to be wanted again. I don't know how much more I can take. God promises not to give us more than we can handle, Sophia. I can't handle being around him. I mean, can't you see that he's changed? You've got to forgive. I can accept him as a brother. But not a fiance. But you're not accepting him as a brother when you're holding his past against him. There's a difference between forgiving someone and trusting them. How can I ever trust him again? How? As soon as he's walking better, he's got to go. Shoo! AnnaLee, where'd the bugout bags go? Jimmy might have 'em. Both of them in the lookout? So where's Adam? Jimmy, were you sleeping? No. Did you take the bugout bags? No. Where's he been? Adam, where have you been? Chris said he would leave food for us, remember? He didn't, but I think dawn is the safest time to travel, especially since I still can't walk very well. You seem to be walking just fine to me. Are you saying that it's just a coincidence that our bags disappear at the same time you did? The bugout bags are missing? Don't play that game with me. What did you do with our bags? Oh, Sophie, it must be exhausting dragging around a dead corpse for old time's sake. Hey guys, come look at this. Is this one of ours? No way, that's like a size 15. Somebody's been here. Wait! No, no, no! Are you okay? What are you looking for? Jimmy? No, no, no, no, no! - What is it? - My box! Eli, AnnaLee, where is my box? We lost half of our ammo, most of our jerky, a canteen, our wire and our medical kit, and you're whining about your old coins and your trinkets. It was on your watch so you have no one to blame but yourself. There was no moon, Sophie! I couldn't see! Well, then the thief had a flashlight. How'd you miss that? You all don't get it. Right now, somebody bad knows you're here. You're going to have to move. Move? Where? I don't wanna move! Mom says to stay here. Faith, we have to move, all right? Adam, do you mind manning the lookout while we pack everything up? Of course. And I forgive you for falsely accusing me. Hey, don't forget that fake limp. So do you think Dad would have prevented this if he could've? Well, yeah, of course. Well, what about Becca's death? Oh, Jimmy. Do you think he would have saved her if he could've? Yeah. Why do you think he would've saved her? 'Cause he loved her. So tell me, Sophie, who's more loving, Dad or God? Jimmy, God is love, in spite of our lack of understanding. Saying it doesn't prove it. I want to know how a loving God could let that happen to Becca. Jesus came to save. The devil, he kills and he steals and he destroys. Do not blame God for the devil's sin. Well, is God in control or not? Look, you blame the devil for everything, but isn't he still under God's control? Tell me, Soph. Who's to blame, the stick or the hand holding the stick? The hand holding the stick! You blame me for all of our stuff getting stolen and accusing me of falling asleep. Well, was God asleep? Or how 'bout when Becca was... Sorry, it was the gun's fault. You guys should come sit. Take a break. I still believe God is good, Jimmy. In spite of evidence to the contrary? You know, Soph, havin' to blindly accept the lack of any meaningful explanation for our suffering, it just covers up incompetence. How could you say that? I have a hard time praying prayers that don't seem to come to pass, but sometimes, the only good answer for the question why is believe. It's a commandment, it's not an answer. The command to believe is the answer. It's a copout! Trust in the Lord with all of your heart and lean not on your own understanding. They're just words, that's it. God's words are not just words. You can't eat 'em, you can't load 'em into a gun and shoot murderers with 'em, and you can't piece a six-year-old's brains back together with 'em. Man shall not live by bread alone, but what? - I need more than that! - Every word of God. Sophie, I need more! I need cold, hard facts rooted in reality! Not empty words, do you understand? Look at me, hey. They're only empty words if you don't believe them. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence, the cold, hard reality of things not seen. You want evidence of God's love? Believe. All because I ask the questions everyone else is thinking but they're afraid to ask. No, it's because you don't want the answers. And because you're asking all the wrong questions. Fine, what's the right question? It's not why are Dad and Becca dead? It's why are we sinners still alive? We're losin' him. Jimmy, wait up. Sophie. Finally, here we are. I have dreamed about this day for so long. Do you love me? I know I've let you down, Sophie. I may never be any more worthy of you than I am of grace. Can you love a man like that? We all know what's next. Adam, you may shake the hand of your bride. Aw, just kiss her, will ya? Woo! Jimmy. No! No! AnnaLee, someone's shooting at Jimmy. You got him! - Don't move! - Wait! I said don't move! Are you okay, Sophie? I've got him. Go check on Jimmy. Look out! Help! AnnaLee! Don't fight me, girl. Hey you, behind the shelter! Help AnnaLee! Don't move! Leave her alone! AnnaLee! Eli, you okay? Oh, thank God. Um, I remembered to take it off the safety this time. Adam! Good job. Adam, are you all right? Adam. You're gonna be okay, Adam. You're gonna be okay. Soph, let him rest. It's all we can do. Sophie, come look at this, now. This was at our house. You were there. Let me tell you something. I should kill you right now. That belongs to my sister. Look! Just let me kill him! No, Jimmy, we're not just gonna kill somebody! What are we gonna do, Sophie? Are you gonna call the police? 'Cause if we let him go, he's gonna come back here and kill us. It's not here. Jimmy! Where's the lock of hair? What? Where is the lock of blonde hair? I thought it was junk. No, Jimmy, no, no, Jimmy! Leave me alone, Sophie! Leave me alone! Jimmy, what He deserves to die! What lock of hair? It was Becca's, all right? It was Becca's. Becca? Don't tell, Jimmy. Stop, let me. I'll fix it. It's better now. I'll get you a hat and put back the scissors. No, Jimmy. Jimmy? No! What? Oh God, oh God, no, no, no, Jimmy, Jimmy! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! - Jimmy, what did you do? - No, Becca! Becca! Becca! We have to learn to forgive ourselves. You were an innocent little boy. No. - Yes. - It's not true, no. - Not your fault. - No. Then who is responsible, Sophie? Who is responsible for it? Do you know whose fault this is? It's God! God is responsible! It's God's fault! That's who! Jimmy, Becca never belonged to us. And God didn't cheat us by taking her to Heaven early. I'm killin' him. Stop! I'm killin' him! He can still change, Jimmy. Remember the thief on the cross? He probably killed Dad, and he probably, God knows what he did to Mom, Eli! He shot Faith! Faith? Faith. I'm so sorry, baby. It was an accident. It wasn't your fault. I don't blame you. Whose food are you gonna give him, huh? Who's gonna watch him when has to go? No, you stay away from him! Jimmy! We've got to take care of him. No, we don't, Faith! Why do you think murdering an unarmed man is the only option, Jimmy? If man's blood is shed by man, then his blood will be shed by man, too. I thought I was gonna die when I got shot on the day Daddy died. I'm so sorry. We can't just kill him. Well, what do you suppose we do? My name's Faith. I don't know. I know who you are. Really? I lost my Faith on the day you were born. I've been a bad man, baby. Why don't you quit being bad? I can't. Ask God to help. I don't know Him anymore. I'll ask Him for you. Don't go near him Faith! Jimmy, wait! This is stupid. Dear Jesus, please. No! Wait, wait! Faith. I got to tell you something about your dad. Go, go, go! Wait, I know that guy. There's a knife under the seat. Protect Jimmy! What? Gun, gun, Jack! Don't shoot, man, don't shoot. Don't shoot. Not gonna need that anymore. Come on. Dad shot somebody? They were gonna kill me! Come on, Liz, pick up for me, pick up! Ah! Here, put pressure on it. What? Your cut, it's bleeding. Check on Jimmy, see if he's bleeding from his ear. No, doesn't look like it. Wait a minute. I know you. Yeah, we've met before. You're that doctor. Is this your kid? That's one of 'em. You know, I only had one. Never got the chance to tell you how sorry I am about your daughter. Sorry don't bring my Faith back or the years I spent in prison. Is there some place you want me to drop you off? Oh, my head. You'll be all right, Jimmy. You're gonna be fine. You can drop me right here. Hey, I need a ride. I'm by the tracks. Change of plans. Bring the gear. We're gonna make a house call. All right, Doc. Time for you to feel my pain. Daddy! Faith, go to the creek. Now. It's my fault. It's my fault. It's all my fault. Hey, it's my fault. It's my fault. I'm sorry. I love you so much. Hey, you're my boy. My boy. Come on. We'll catch up. All right. I don't know why we're wasting our time going to the park. We'll never be happy again. You know, we're all sad, but we will see her again. How can I go play with Jimmy pretending that it never happened? Um, okay. When Becca died, it just was as if all I could feel was anger. Baby, God is good. He's what is good in this broken world, and He is loving, even when we're not sure about it now. But if we trust Him, everything, everything will be fine. More than fine, it'll be beautiful. Oh, Mommy, I just don't see it. I know, baby, and that's why we walk by faith, not by sight. Just imagine all the good things that God has given to us, hmm? I love you. I love you. All the darkness of this world is just a tiny little speck in the light. We're not gonna lose faith and make a decision based on fear, a fear of a godless future that doesn't even exist. Vengeance belongs to God, not us. Soph, Sophie. Sophie. Shh. - Sophie. - Shh, don't talk. Adam, you are a good man. And I forgive you. There's no greater love than the one you've given me. Will you marry me? Yes. With this ring, I thee wed. Why? You should've let me kill him! 'Cause now he's out there and he's comin' back. You can be sure of that. Jimmy, please think this through. Come with me, buddy. Jimmy, don't go, please. We're a family! Jimmy, Jimmy, please! Fire, the tepee's on fire! Faith, go try and save the bugout bag, go! Grab those buckets! Sophie! Go fill it up with water, come on! Guys, guys, just stop. It's hopeless. It's over. What do we do now? There's nothing left. Our bow and arrows are gone. I want to go to Heaven to be with Daddy and Mommy. Okay. It's just a little while longer, okay? Just a little while longer. Sophie, Eli! Faith? - Mommy? - Faith! Mommy! Mom, we missed you. I'm so glad you're okay. I saw the smoke. It's gonna be fine, it's gonna be fine. I missed you so much. Oh, Soph, I missed you. Mom. I need a moment alone with her. Yes, ma'am, take your time. I wish you'd been here. Man, your mom missed you guys so much. I couldn't save him. She talked about you guys. I missed her a lot, too. Anybody hurt? I'm so sorry, baby. How'd you do it, Mom? How do you let go? I'm not sure I have. Who did this? Doesn't even matter. We're gonna get through this together. Come on. Mom, what now? These men are deputies. They're gonna take us some place safe. Really? We're the good guys. I'm Jase. And I'm his big brother Dave, and his hero, his role model, his father figure. I don't mean to brag. Don't forget to tell 'em about your humility. Listen, I'm the better brother because I have some chocolate in my bag. They're not gonna eat that out of your grubby bag. Yes, they will, and I know what you're thinking. Why would anybody walk through these woods with Christmas tree lights draped across their chest like that? It's ridiculous. Because I look so good in 'em. No, you don't look good. You look like an idiot. You're screamin' for someone to shoot us. Anything's better than walkin' around with a rifle that weighs, like, 50 pounds. Where's Jimmy? Ah! Sophie, help! Help! Sophie! AnnaLee! Help, help! Help! Jimmy! Robby, Robby, I was on my way to join you guys. Well, somebody call 911. I had my eye on this bad boy. Oh! Ah, oh yeah, that's nice. No, Clint, don't kill him! What? You heard me. Don't kill him, okay? Jimmy and I, we go, we go way back. - Oh. - It's true. Okay. Yeah. Robby! Jase, you and Liz, Sophie. Just wait here for me. Kneel down right here. What'd you do that for? 'Cause it's my turn! Robby! - No! - Yeah, thank ya. You guys just do what I say, and you'll be fine. Jimmy, what's gonna happen to me? I don't know. Robby? Jimmy, it hurts. Robby, stay with me, Robby! Your sisters, now they got food and guns. Please, please just leave 'em alone. Stop acting like you care about 'em. You already told Robby you were gonna leave 'em, right? You wanted to join the gang. Now what did you think that'd do for their chances of survival, huh? God, God. I'm sorry. Oh, he's finding religion with his neck in a noose. So meaningful. They're about to shoot him. Take aim. We've got to do this together. There's too many of 'em. I can't do it. You will do it or Jimmy will die. Pick it up. You take the guy with the machete, on three. One, two. Ah, missed one. Jimmy's aiming at Mom. Watch for friendly fire over there, Christmas Tree. How in the world was he born first? Help! Hey, shot your daddy, shot your sister. Now you. But first your Mama. Jimmy, baby, it's gonna be okay. Mom. Okay, get ready to pull him. We need to I'm so sorry. Pull back! I'm sorry. - I shouldn't have went inside. - It's okay. Pull him back, pull him back! Pull him back! Gimme that canteen. Sophie. You're okay, you're okay. You were right, Sophie. I should've watched my step after all. Here, baby, drink this. You've lost a lot of blood. Mom! It's over! Sophie, Sophie, no, no, no! He defended me! He defended me, Soph! You know this guy? If it's over, then drop the bow. - Drop the bow. - He saved my life. And the arrows. You did this to us. - Mom! - Take it easy, Liz. He's unarmed. The gear, the ammo, it's all there. Jimmy, the lock of hair, Becca's lock of hair, it's there, too. I'm so sorry. It wasn't mine to take. Mom, stop. You did this to us. You killed my husband! Think about what you're doin', Liz. I'm sorry. Mom, please. I deserve your hate. Please. He killed your father and Adam. Stay back, Faith! And now he's come for Faith? I never wanted to take your Faith. I just needed to find mine. I just needed to find mine. Mom, we will see them again. Mercy is the light, the light that swallows up all the darkness. I forgive you, Jack. What? Faith, Faith. Sophie, you can forgive him for the crime against you. But for murder, he's gonna stand trial. Now don't try to run off. Jase and I can take ya, but once your fists start flying, I'm afraid he may curl up into a fetal position, start sucking his thumb like he did when we were kids. I ain't going anywhere. I've been fighting with Him ever since my Faith died, destroying everything in my way. I'm done running. I owe those kids and their mother more than I can ever repay. How could they forgive me like that? I'm so ashamed. Man, you can never repay it, but there's one who's already paid it for you. It's Jesus. I was so close to killing him. If you had, you'd be dead right now. God can save anybody. He might turn out to be the best of us. I'm askin'. I'm askin'. Lord, forgive me for all the pain I've caused, for all I've done wrong. Hey! It's my turn. I'll see you again, my love. Jack may have got baptized, but he needs some deodorant right about now. Ooh! - Jack. - Jack. I thought that was you. No, man. Your hands gettin' warm over there? You guys are hoggin' the fire. - Well. - Feel good? - Yeah. - I'm not sharing. - Oh. - What's it like out there? It's chaos, it's anarchy. But here's the good part, is that our city is one of the few islands of light in a nation full of darkness. And now our city is actually one of the only places successfully resisting tyranny and disarmament. Is there hope? For our nation, I mean. If God can fix me and Jack, He can do anything.
