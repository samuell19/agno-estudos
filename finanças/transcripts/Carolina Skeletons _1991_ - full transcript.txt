I know you two shared some real good times. But death comes to all of us who have patience. [laughs] Didn't you always laugh when you told me that. [sighs] Got me to thinkin' about that time you took me to the execution, that young negro boy, 'bout my age. Linus Bragg. I was tryin' to remember whether it was Dex or you that eh, got that boy to confess... Did y'all have any other suspects besides him? [Hiram Stoker] You hungry yet, boy? Boy?...Boy?! -I asked you a question, son. -[Linus Bragg whispering prayers] You hungry yet? Sure am, suh. [Hiram Stoker] That's better. But first, I got a little problem, 'bout them two little white girls. Would you mind helpin' me clear up a few details, Linus? No, suh. You go to that colored school, don't you? Learnin' all about how to read and write? Little bit. Learnin' too, about that feelin' all us men gets between our legs, I'll just bet. Heh heh. You don't have to tell me about it. Just got to know what happened with them girls. Mmm-mmm! That smells good! Hey I don't believe you had a bite to eat since this morning, have you son? That's right, sheriff. Well, the truth'll make you feel better. Let me talk to you a minute. Now, son, I don't understand. I know... that you didn't mean for anything bad to happen to those girls. You just got a peek at 'em... ain't that the way it got started? Just a little peek? Yes, suh. Well, one thing leads to another and, before you know it, everything gets outta control. Shoot, that could happen to any man. Yes suh, but I-- [Hiram Stoker] Now, son, I know what went on. We got all the evidence we need. So I just... sketched things out for you... best I could. And I want you to read it over. [Hiram Stoker] Only thing missin' is... the stick that killed 'em. You know where it's at? No suh? Sure enough don't. Now, Linus, this is the truth, ain't it? I gotta know. Your mama's tole you I bet a thousand times, about how you're not supposed to ever tell a lie, ain't that so? Yes, suh. Well, you know how to sign your name, don't you? Yes, suh. All right. Here's a pen for ya. No, wait. Let me help you, son... You just unscrew it, you see? Like that. There, that's it.

I got to know what happened. -[indistinct screaming] -[Junior] Daddy, please... I got to know what really happened. The way I see it, you got two choices. You put the bags on the hood of the car and hope they stay balanced long enough for you to get your car keys out... Or? Or you can throw them up in the air and hope they stay up there long enough for you to get the door open. -I think I like this way the best. -[Bragg] Good choice. Somebody was waiting for me outside the motel last night. Drove around the parking lot a couple of times, and then they left. -Did you see who it was? -No, it was too dark. But I have got a sneaking suspicion that whoever killed those two little girls is still hanging around here somewhere. [Bragg] Cassie, I need a favor. My leave is almost up, and I'm having a hell of a time trying to get a look at a will... You don't need me for that. Anything that has gone through probate is on file at the clerk's office.

You know what I told old man Crooks? "Times have changed." Isn't that funny. "Times have changed." [laughs] The Last Will and Testament of Harrison Baines Campbell... filed into probate May 27, 1947. See his wife preceded him in death, and so T.J. was the only heir... He was apparently very disappointed in his son. He only left him the house, and just enough money to get by. He also left five thousand dollars to Sheriff Hiram Stoker, and the same to Dexter Cody, and one thousand dollars and a lifetime's occupancy of a shack to Elijah Crooks. What happened to the rest of the money? You'd never guess. He left the bulk of his estate, well over one hundred thousand dollars, [Cassie] to the NAACP. [whistles] No wonder he had this will sealed.
