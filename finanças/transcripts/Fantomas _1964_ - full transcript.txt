Allow me, madam. My compliments, madam. Hello, sir. Good that you're here. Mr. Royer will show you the objects. I'll leave you alone with him. I'll show you the jewels. Could you give them to me? This one's alright. I'll show you a few so you can make a choice. Very nice, don't you think? I'll take that one as well. And this is the famous necklace with the diamonds. I'll take that too. Put them in a jewel case for Lord Shelton. How much is it? Five million five hundred thousand. New francs, of course. Shall I have them delivered? - No, I'm taking them. Thank you. Goodbye. That went well. - Lord Shelton was in a good mood. Director. - What's happening? The police are vigilant. Do not worry. Fantomas' days are numbered. Take that from chief of police Juve. Do not worry. Fantomas is really not that special. He's just like you and me. He committed crimes... ...but traffic causes many more victims than he does. He blew up planes and derailed trains... ...but road hogs are much more dangerous. We'll get him. I'd start shaking in my boots, Fantomas. You have a hundred faces, but only one head. And soon it will be chopped off. I'll get you. He laughs best who laughs last. Trust me, there's no reason for concern. Thank you, chief. That was police chief Juve. He came to our studio to tell you the police are vigilant. That was it for now. Now the police are exaggerating. - They don't take us seriously. Listen. This is on the front page. That paper of yours has guts. Listen to this. 'Long live Fantomas. Fantomas, you don't exist.' Isn't that a good headline? - Cut it out. What would you know. 'At the losers' ball you're the buffoon... ...who leads the dance.' Isn't that a bit pompous? - You just concentrate on your pictures. It gets even better. 'The police are vigilant. No, police chief Juve, the police send us to sleep. You made up those hundred faces to save your own face. And it gets worse: Housing shortage: Fantomas. Expensive meat: Fantomas.' They had to put in something 'social', didn't they? 'Taxes, misconduct: Fantomas.' The villain, the untraceable one, the elusive one, the guilty one: Fantomas. What do you think, darling? - You want my opinion? I think it's crazy. And they say that love is blind. Somebody's going to have a really good laugh. Who? - Fantomas. I wish he'd really exist and that you'd walk into him. Do you think he'd scare me? He must be an interesting man. Sometimes I wonder what's so interesting about you. That doesn't change that your article's bad. Use your imagination for a change. If Fantomas doesn't exist, you have to make him up. Give me a kiss, darling. You just gave me a great idea. Come on. Where are we going? - To Fantomas. Are you ready? Here we go. Don't move. Another one. That should do. "The monster told me everything" Today in 'Le Point du Jour': an interview with Fantomas. The world in the hands of a lunatic. Interview with Fantomas. 'Soon, I'll rule the world. Humankind is at my mercy.' 'Soon, I'll have the ultimate weapon.' The ultimate weapon. Nonsense. An army needs its infantry. It's time, Excellency. That's going to be quite a press conference. 'If I want, I blow up the planet. And stupid Juve can't do anything about it.' 'Maybe the big fireworks will be held tomorrow. It's going to be a great spectacle. And you will all be in the front row. The end is nigh. Forget about your monthly pay. If you must die, die in beauty. Sensational, great. This is what I expected from you: a moment of genius. That reminds me of my youth, when I would have the good ideas. That's a fantastic hoax. - What, a hoax? It's nonsense, of course. - Not at all. I'm not a subscriber. Admit it. - I won't say anything without my lawyer. You could use a good lawyer. 'Do not disturb.' It's a disgrace. And eavesdropping, isn't that a disgrace? You're going too far. Everything's allowed as long as it sells. Blood sells. Without murders, you'd be on the dole. But you first. Because our job consists of more than just crime stories. Terrorising people, do you call that a job? I'm going to prove that this article... this piece of trash is full of lies. That's going to make a lot of noise, I'm telling you. Smile. Pay attention. Thank you. - You're welcome. On the front page, four columns. Good for sales. Gentlemen, I'm going to tell you what I've decided. I've been able to give this case a lot of thought. My conclusion is as follows: There has been an explosion. An explosion requires explosives. Fantomas blew up the newspaper. There's a connection between Fantomas and our... friend, the journalist. Makes sense. - Think with me here. If we keep an eye on the journalist, we'll eventually find... Fantomas. What about that! See you very soon. The idiots. How smart. What do you want? Come along, you. Let me go, idiots. - We'll teach you some manners. You're ruining my plan. - Explain that at the station. But I'm the chief of police. - And I'm the president. You need to sleep off the booze. - A night with us won't harm you. Careful. in a few moment, Fantomas will come to get you. Leave me alone. Save your imagination for your articles. Yes, it's me, Fantomas. You'll never know my true face. It remains hidden from everybody under this mask. You wrote an article about me that ridiculed me. You portrayed me as a fool. Let him go. Sit down. You thought you could mock me without suffering the consequences. I have an excuse. I didn't believe you existed. I thought I proved that. You portrayed me as an idiot in an interview that was entirely made up. As a morbid, gloomy lunatic. And I'm really very cheerful. I kill, of course. But always with a smile. Crimes against humanity... Humanity... What a beautiful puppet show. Impossible to get bored. You have a sense of humour. Gallows humour, the rarest kind. Humour that's hidden behind a mask. Excuse me. This is not the time to make fun of me. You ridiculed me... ...but you also proved that a great man is nothing without the press. So you'll put a new article about me on your front page. You'll admit it was a fraud. And if you don't write favourably about me this time... ...terrible torture will await you. You get two days. Two days, that's not enough. - I'm finished talking. How do we meet again? I would like to set a date for the next time. You have nothing to fear, as long as you obey me. From now on, you're in control of your life. And remember: from now on, you'll follow my orders. Darling, can you hear me? Open up. Are you ill, sweetheart? Open up. I was so worried. What happened? - I didn't wake up. I was afraid something had happened to you. I called, but you didn't answer. I was asleep. What's wrong? You should know, I had a nightmare. Imagine... A night at the station. Me. A good thing the press don't know about it. If you had carried your identity papers... That's a smart comment. You'll get far in life. I wasn't wearing my jacket. I can't think of everything. Chief? The fact that the police gave you a hard time... What a nightmare. - That guy was a tough cookie. You have too much imagination. You're hurting me. - You've got a bump. A huge bump. It's true. Exactly where I was hit. What is that? It wasn't a dream. It was Fantomas. Who's there? - Fantomas. Don't open. Please. I'm calling the police. The lines have been cut. Open up. - Don't. You gave me two days. Is that so? Police. Chief Juve. Open up. Bravo. You fooled me. - But not me. Gentlemen... Have you gone mad? - Mind what you're saying. I'm arresting you in the name of the law. You can't be serious. - I'm a serious man. So Fantomas gave you two days. But why and for what? So you're in touch with Fantomas. You didn't press charges. That's complicity. I understood it all. What's that? - I don't mind explaining. Never mind. F for Fantomas. That's just a coincidence. We're going to put you through the mill. Take him with you. But this is outrageous. - Don't make it worse for him. What a lovely pâté. You can eat and drink after you confess. Nobody died from a two day fast. It's quite good for you, actually. Alright. Speak up. You've been asking me the same questions for two days. I told you everything. I can't go on like this. White wine is bad for the nerves. - Now I'm fed up. You made the article up, didn't you? - That's true. Just when everybody thinks it's true. It is. What is? That everybody believes it? - No, that it's made up. Suppose it was a lie, why did Fantomas kidnap you? Exactly because it was a lie. - You're lying, you're lying. He's lying. You mean I'm lying about the lying or that I'm lying... Shut up. Shut up. - But listen. I'm not tolerating anymore rudeness. Enough. This man is clearly tired. He's losing the plot. We'll continue tomorrow. Take him to his cell. I'm wasting time here... Take it easy. It'll be a five column article. Fantomas will be happy. And Mr Compère will get you out of here in no time. There he is. "Fantomas totally outraged!" 'Le Point du Jour', please. To 'Le Point du Jour'. Quickly. Follow him. Sabotage. Fantomas is behind it. Stop a cab. Hurry. Where do I find one? Fantomas will be happy. What's this? Where are you taking me? Sit down. You can go. This time you really went too far. Let me explain. It wasn't me... Shut up. Can you come over? I want to introduce our guest to you. As punishment... ...I'll force you to cooperate on something extraordinary. What's that? - My masterpiece. The creation of a perfect man, who obeys me completely. Except, he doesn't have any brains yet. Yours would suffice. I'm flattered. But to be honest, there are better brains out there. Modest, therefore intelligent. Together, we'll create something beautiful. My experiments are very advanced. Take your time. It would be a shame to ruin something so wonderful. Don't worry. I succeed in everything I do. Lady Beltham, my loyal helper and friend. She assists me in everything. Nice to meet you. If you don't mind me saying that... She was married to Lord Beltham, who disappeared. Lord Beltham? The corpse in the mysterious suitcase? That's the one. But then you're... - Correct. I'm sure you'll get along fine. Thank you, friend. Could anyone think of a more beautiful widow? A diabolical beauty. The ideal woman. She has all the vices. Lady Beltham will be an attentive host to you. Are you leaving already? - Only for a few days. I'll make sure you'll look bad in the public opinion. Those you love, will hate you. The news of your death will be a relieve to everybody. I'll turn you into a bloodthirsty monster. How? By using your name and your face... ...to commit spectacular crimes. You'll take my secret into your grave. I discovered how to make perfect imitations of human skin. I commit the majority of my crimes with the face of a victim. These are examples of my compositions. I assumed their identities the way I'll assume yours. Each time, I recreated their fingerprint... ...on gloves of the same fabric. And don't try to flee. Photoelectric cells would make your attempts useless. And if you try to use violence... ...a signal from Lady Beltham will activate my bodyguards. You can go. You can see what you're doing on TV. See you. You'll hear about yourself. Chief of police Juve challenges Fantomas Will the monster strike during the jewellery show? Our guests are requested to go to our roof terrace. The jewellery show is about to start there. Make them close up. There they are. Back off, ladies and gentlemen. Stay on the pavement. Open up. Your fiancé urgently wants to speak to you. Aren't you the photographer of 'Le Point du Jour'? Let go of me. Are you crazy? Do you know where the box has to go? I'm the secretary-general of the employers' organisation. Your jewellery is guarded well. - I don't doubt that. Put it on the desk. Here it is, chief. - After you. Close the door. Great. Director, the jewels are here. These are the jewels the employers' organisation provided. Beautiful. They're worth hundreds of millions. Billions, director. Bravo. Let's hope this attracts Fantomas. And this time he won't escape. It was a brilliant idea. Is everything ready? Good, let's start then. Are the ladies almost ready? - In a couple of minutes. Never mind. Don't be afraid. I'm here. Chief, can I ask you... Excellency, chairman, ladies and gentlemen. It's a big honour for me to organise this great spectacle ...under the supervision of the jewellers' association... ...and our great newspaper 'Le Point du Jour'. Keep your eyes open, ok? You'll see the most elegant models of Paris... ...adorned with the most beautiful jewellery from the capital. Number five, please. You're in a hurry, aren't you? You're about to see the most beautiful creations demonstrated by the most beautiful creatures. Who's that beard? They have an extraordinary figure. A true paradise. Ladies and gentlemen, the show is about to begin. Please all be seated. Number 18. Number 19. Turquoise and diamonds. Number 20. Ruby and diamonds. Number 21. Diamonds and emerald. This is number 7. Can I have number 12? What's with them? Number 24. Diamonds. Open up. What's happening? I'll break the door open. Go ahead. Hurry. Hold the thief. It's Fantomas. He'll pay for this. Call the alarm. Call the alarm. - Why? There he is. It's him. It's Fantomas. Just wait. I'll get you. Alive. I'll get you. I'll grab you. You'll pay for this. Stop it. I'll get you. My investigation led to a remarkable conclusion. The Fantomas mystery has been solved. This is his true face. So it's that journalist. We only have to arrest him. It seems that his fiancée is an accomplice... ...because she disappeared as well. The conclusion seems clear... It worked well, didn't it? Don't worry about your fiancée. She's safe here in the most beautiful room of the castle. Do you want to see her? You have taste. She still has to get used to her new environment. She's great. You can follow our romance from here. Are you intending on a romance with my fiancée? That's certainly possible. But do you think such an escapade would amuse Lady Beltham? I won't inform her. I'm a romantic spirit. I want to be loved the way you were. I'll take my time. Hélène will never agree... Never say never about a woman. She's so happy. My elixir already has an effect on her. After the flowers of evil, now the flowers of romance. This special woman will be my reward. I'll only have to take care of your friend the police chief. That idiot is getting on my nerves more and more. I must and I shall have his head. Bewildering report on the bloodthirsty monster. Fantomas, Fantomas, Fantomas. Always Fantomas. This time we have witnesses. Arrest them. Interrogate them, I mean. - We did. So, tell me. Are you sure you saw the journalist on the roof? Are you kidding me? Are you saying I'm hallucinating? The witnesses give very different descriptions. Then they're mad. Have somebody draw up a profile. All the witnesses to the projection room. - We already started. Please sit down. We're going to reconstruct the suspect's profile. We're trying to make a sketch of Fantomas' face... ...based on your instructions. This requires your full attention. Lights out. We start with the eyes. Do you recognise them? Do you recognise the mouth? And do you recognise this hair? And the nose? Do you recognise it? Silence, please. Again: the hair. No, he had short hair. - And he was bald on top. That's it, yes. The nose. It was longer. - And broader. The mouth. No, his mouth was much thinner. That's it. A cruel mouth. The eyes. No, he looked more sadistic. - Like a feral beast. That's it exactly. That's exactly the depraved look. Enough. Silence. What's this? Is this a joke? Where do those people come from? This will have consequences. I demand an investigation. Clear the room. I don't feel well. We'll continue tomorrow. I'm going to sleep. The chief's acting strange. - I'd even say weird. Very weird. Stop it. Silence. Scoundrel. - I can't help having car trouble. Hands in the air. Quickly and shut up. One movement and you're dead. And don't you dare leave the building. Wait nicely until the police arrive. That must be Fantomas again. We have to warn the chief. Not answering? Strange. He did say he was going home. You stay here. Come along, Léon. Something must have happened to him. Look what I found here. Isn't that strange? It's getting stranger and stranger. We're going through the window. How long have you been standing there? That's a very bad joke. Are you sleepwalking maybe? - I can explain. You'll laugh. But you won't. Fantomas struck again. That's impossible. Turn around. Hurry up. Silence, please. We're starting the reconstruction. This is chief Juve. What happened? - That's him. You get food after you confess. - Michel... When it happened, you were asleep. And you didn't hear the phone. I had cotton wool in my ears. - Cotton wool, huh? And the slipper? - I threw it out of the window. Yes, that's what they're for. - Somebody was making a lot of noise. But you didn't hear the phone. - I already explained that. Weren't you committing crimes? - Stupid idiot. Careful now. You're insulting an officer. We have the fingerprints. - Good. And? - They're yours. Then that's the proof. I'm Fantomas. I didn't realise it, but I'm he. Look. I'm Fantomas. Darling, wake up. Where are we? I don't know. Whose car is that? - No idea. What happened? You must have fallen asleep. - I have a headache. Yesterday was worse. You looked so strange. Finally, you're back with me. What happened to me? I was taking pictures during the jewellery show and that's the last I remember. And then I was in a helicopter with you. Very original. Never a dull moment with you. They drugged us. I'll explain it to you later. That elixir and all that. - You're losing the plot, I think. What's that? Look. Lady Beltham. 'I'm giving you back your freedom. Don't try to understand women.' We have a car. This road must lead somewhere. This is the first time that I'm saved by a woman's jealousy. You spoke too soon. You don't know women yet. That bitch sabotaged the brakes. I can't change to a lower gear. The gearbox is also broken. The ravine. Pay attention. - I am paying attention. Do you want to do it? It's turning. - Of course it is. Pay attention, darling. Trucks. That's not possible. - Hold tight. I'm scared. - Let go. I'm sick. - Let go. You're crazy. Stay here. I'm sick. We got out alright. You're very funny. I'll tell you something: I never had such a good laugh. So Lady Beltham let you escape because she was jealous of your fiancée? That's right. She wanted to kill us by tampering with the car. You have such an active imagination. - That woman... Your story about Fantomas isn't true. Because I arrested Fantomas. Can I ask who it is? - Chief Juve. I thought as much. - Yes, because you helped him. Of course, it all makes perfect sense. Write down his confession. The masks, the prints. I should have known. It was simple. - But explain it to a cop. Come along. Where are you taking us? - Do as I say. And no questions. Where is he taking us? - No idea. The guillotine has gone out of fashion. I have something better. Patience, please. Two brains know more than one. What's he on about? - I'll explain. It's a surprise. Get up. Other car. Get in. Are they keeping quiet? - I haven't heard them yet, today. What's happening? Fantomas escaped. Which one? - Both. That's impossible. Let's think. - But we must be quick. They're in danger. The statement of the guard, the masks, Fantomas' card. Everything's correct. They're innocent. - Yes, of course. It's a disaster. I locked up the chief. They're far away by now. It's about time you caught Fantomas. You're right. Nothing's lost yet. Close off the roads. I'll get that Fantomas. Count me in. It has to be that black car. They saw us. The helicopter. Stop. Open fire. Quickly. They're being followed by cops on bikes. Don't worry, it's an armoured car. The windows and tires are bullet-proof. I organised things well. Take care of him. He hit me. - You shouldn't hang out of the window. Come here quickly. I'm chief Juve. Untie me. Quickly. We're in a big hurry. What are you doing? - The bike. Excuse me. Quickly, quickly. Faster. Look, down there. Hold tight. Hold tight. There he is. They're on bikes. Follow them. I didn't intend to chase them on horseback. How do I do this? I'm coming. Help. Hold on. The villain. Now what? - We'll get him. Jump then. That's forty francs. My car is being stolen. Isn't the gentleman with you? What's this? - Just get in. Did you steal that car? - Calm down now. Go on. We have to catch up with them. There he is. On the locomotive. The trail leads to the left. Now what? - Follow the road and then see... We have to turn left. Left. - How? Through the fields? I confirm my previous request. Make sure the Cris-craft is ready at jetty 27. Understood. The Cris-craft will be at the agreed location. I see somebody running. He must be going to the beach. I bet he went towards the sea. Too late. The helicopter. There they are. At the beach. They're signalling us. We have to go down. He saw us. What am I going to do here all on my own? That's him. That motorboat, that's the Cris-craft. Catch up with it. Faster. Faster. There. What are you doing? - I'm getting out. Speed up. Wait a moment. I'm getting out. Lower. Even lower. Wait a bit. And lower. Lower. Take it easy. In the name of the law. Open up. Just you wait. Here he is. Dive twenty meters. We're sinking. Help me. Quickly. Look, the water's rising. I'm drowning. I'm going to drown. I can't swim. I forgot how. I used to know, but now... We'll drown. I sent the helicopter back. I'm drowning. Not at all. Look. Darling... - I'm drowning. Hold on, chief. Give me your hand. You first, chief. - No, you go first. I can't. Isn't it a bit small? Are you comfortable? - I don't know. It's not over yet. We'll meet again, Fantomas. And next time, you won't escape me. You'll get your punishment.
