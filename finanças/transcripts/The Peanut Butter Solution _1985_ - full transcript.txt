[exciting music] [whistle blowing] [crowd cheering] [upbeat music] [pleasant music] - [Boy Voiceover] That's my sister, Susan Allison Baskin. "The Wretch." See the blue robe she's wearing? Looks too big, eh? Well it's Mom's and she's gone away. She's wearing it because she knows it really, really bugs me. - I told you, she said I could. - [Boy] But why? It's too big for you anyway. [sighing] - I'm sorry but there's nothing I can do about it. Now give me your plate. - I don't want any of that guck. Your toast is burning. - Oh God. Come on, eat it Michael! - No. - It's fruit. It's exactly what Mom makes and you eat that. - I don't want any. - Come on. Ugh. That does it, that really does it. - [Bob] Pizza face. [jazz piano music] - I can't stand him, do you hear? I can't stand him. Everything I do is wrong. The food, the money, the dishes. Dad, are you listening to me? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you, Suz. I am just too tired for all your squabbling today. I've been up all night! It's not easy for him either. With Mom gone, don't forget that. - What do you mean? She's not dead, you now. [birds chirping] [knocking] [entry bell ringing] - Hi Superman, coming to soccer practice? - Hi, Connie. - Gee, what's wrong with you? - Nothing. Well, Suzie. - Look, here you're just a brother, right? But on the soccer field, you're a star, come on. - Maybe. Hey, did you hear the fire engines last night? - Are you kidding? I was right in the middle of the action. [laughing] Hi, Mr. Baskin. Hi, Suzie, nice morning for a ride. - Hi, Connie. - [Mr. Baskin] God, it's the human flea. Are you here for breakfast or are you just wiggling through? - [Connie] I'm just having some of these delicious grapes, if that's okay. - What? - I said, I'm just having some of these delicious grapes, if that's okay with you. - Do I have a choice? - [Michael] Connie was at a fire last night, Dad. - Yeah, it was fabulous. All started about midnight. Half the neighborhood was there but I got the closest. - Yeah, I'll bet. - I was wiggling through the fireman's legs, the hoses spraying up all around me. The guy's coming all suffocated from the smoke, coughing like this. [mimicking coughing] [giggling] Boy, those flames. You shoulda seen them. - Where was it? - This old spooky house near school. You now, the one that whino has been sleeping in all winter. - [Suzie] What's wrong with you? [somber piano music] - [Michael Voiceover] Oh boy, the old spooky house. Outside. I saw one from yesterday. One of the whinos camps there. He was outside the bank. He was begging but nobody was giving him anything. It's funny how little things you do can change your whole life. So I gave him some money, all that I had. - Shoot, soccer practice, come on! - Hey, hey, hey. Play well, eh buddy. - [Suzie] Comb your hair, Michael. - Yeah! Hold on! I wanna check and see if there are any letters from Mom! - [Connie] Hurry up! - Again, nothing. - Oops. Hey, you little guys. It's dangerous around here for you. Whoops. Watch out, there's ants. - [Michael] Ants? There's no ants. - There are! - You're strange, Connie. Was that true about the fire or were you just trying to scare us? - [Connie] No, it's true, I swear it! [crow squawking] See? Now do you believe me? - I wanna look inside. - No, come on. People died in there just a few hours ago. - Oh, gross. Why do you have to be such a slob? How is this supposed to be clean? Supposed to be responsible. Smell that. - Ugh, God. Go on, get that out of here. God, Suz, I can't concentrate with you yap, yap, yapping away! You're late for school, go on, off. Off with you. - Thought I'd dress first. - [Dad] Very funny. - Oh, it's easy to be funny in a madhouse. You just be normal. - [Dad] Hey, wish me luck with the rabbit. - Good luck. - Thank you. - Don't fight. Gum out, please. [children chattering] Pick it up, don't drag it. Pick up the books. Jessica, stop running. See me after school. After school. - Look at him. Look at that way he sits. Look at the muscles rippling under the skin. That's anatomy. Every great artist knows anatomy. Stay there, stay there. Five minutes for this pose. Just five minutes. - [Connie] Hey, Michael. [chuckling] Did you get to the building? - Yeah but it's all blocked up, he can't get in. You know what, they say there's still bodies-- - Silencio! Look at the shadow under the belly. [speaking foreign language] Three dimension. Look at him! [children giggling] Up. [growling] [grunting] That's a pig, it's not a dog! Start again! Down Jim, down Jim. - Almost a dog, Orson. Almost. Up, Jim, up, up. Look at him. Don't use imagination. - I don't use imagination, Signor. I use the charcoal. - Oh, mamma mia. - [Connie] That's my little sister. - Don't, Wong. I will get to you I a minute. Oh, beautiful, beautiful, Jennifer. Oh, fantastic. And you? You have done nothing. - But, Signor, I can't do him. He keeps sitting down. - Oh yeah. [speaking foreign language] - Oh, it's scary, Signor. [chuckling] - Put it in your bedroom. - [Connie] Watch out, Mike! - What are these serious squiggles? - They're flames, Signor. - Flames? I do not see any flames on Jim. [children giggling] - I imagined them. - You imagined them? You dare to imagine in my class? I told you a thousand times, no imagination! Only what you see! I want accuracy! This is accurate! This is the dog. That is rubbish! - [Michael] But, Signor. - Start again. - If his father sells paintings for six thousand dollars a piece, what was wrong with his? - Let's see what you have done wrong, Wong. You have done wrong, Wong. [chuckling] - If you do that, Signor, I will never come to your class again and I swear it. - [Man] Hello there. - [Dad] Okay, Arthur, come on up. - Arise he said and arise I did. Ah. - Over here we have... "Relaxing Bird." - [Arthur] Ugh. - "Well Dressed Bird." [Arthur laughing] - That's amusing. [laughing] Yes but empty. - "Bird Singing to Cat." - Oh. Hmmmmm. - Thanks a lot Bunny Bugs. So, what's wrong with my birds? - Oh, they're marvelous, Billy. But-- - But my last show was a sellout. - Yes, yes. But these I can't sell, I'm sorry. - Well, you could at least try. Betty's gone to Australia, her father died. Do you have any idea how much money that is costing me? - Billy, my clients don't care about your personal problems. You know that. What's that? - Don't, don't touch that. Don't touch that. Nobody touches anything here but me, all right, all right? - May I at least look at it? - Yes. You may. At least look at it. - Hmmmm. Lovely, just lovely. That I could sell tomorrow. - Well, you're not going to, it's not for sale. It's a birthday present. - At six thousand dollars for it, I'd say. That's four thousand dollars for you, Billy. - No. I said no and I mean no. [somber music] - Uh oh, how're we gonna get in? [crow squawking] Holy mackerel! You gonna try it? I said, are you gonna try it? - [Michael] No, I'm gonna do it. I'm going around here. - Hey, Michael. Come this way, it's easier. [ominous music] [grunting] [thudding] Ah. My leg, ah. Ah. Hey, Michael, stop! Come on, Mike, please don't be so stupid. Look, I'm sorry I suggested it, okay? It's suicide. Okay, if you're gonna be so stupid, I'm gonna leave. I tell you, I'm leaving right now. I tell you, I'm leaving. [Michael screaming] [eerie music] Mike! Speak to me! [computer beeping] [calculator cranking] [knocking] - He's not home yet. He's not home yet! What for? I told you, he's not home yet, dingy. - I know, he's over there. - Michael, get out of there. - [Connie] He can't, he's unconscientious. - [Suzie] How can he be unconscientious? - He had a little accident. - I'm getting Dad. - [Connie] No, don't. Just help me lift him up. [somber music] - Where am I? - It's okay, son, you're home now. - I phoned the hospital. Doctors don't make house calls. - Oh great, the kid could be dying for all they care. - Am I dying? - No, you look pretty much alive to me, kiddo. So what happened to you? - I don't remember. Except for... [eerie music] Connie and I were going to the burnt up mansion. - Darn you, Conrad, that's just what I thought. - No, I tried to stop him for the longest time. - Stop him from what? - Remember this morning I told you about the fire and you got angry at me about the whinos? Well he went to see it too but we were late for soccer practice and said after school hoping you'd forget but then in art class it all got started again. - [Billy] What got started again? - About us going to the fire and when we got there, one of us had the idea of looking inside. When I tried I said, "Hey, stop, it's suicide." But he said there were still survivors. And I said I was leaving but when he didn't leave, I didn't leave. So he got to the window and he saw something. - [Suzie And Billy] But what did he see? - I don't remember. - Poor thing. He's got a bad case of amnesia. - Hey, you're a lucky boy. You've had yourself some sort of extraordinary fright. But just think, people pay good money for a fright at the movies and you got yourself one for free. [chuckling] Right? - [Michael] Yeah. - We'll see you later, Conrad. - Will he be at school tomorrow? - [Suzie] Of course. - Scat! [ominous music] How's he sleeping? - Fine, but I found the cat curled up on his head like a fur hat. So I kicked it off. I don't believe it. - [Billy] Jeez, I hate that cat. - Come on, out of there. Naughty Pablo. Bad puss. [entry bell ringing] - Hi. Is it all right if I drop in early before school? I feel sorta bad about yesterday, even if it wasn't my fault. - What's the point of asking? You're already in. That's all right. - How is he then? - Oh, he's fine. He'll be down in a sec. Here, have some toast. - No thanks. I think I'd rather stick to grapes if you don't mind? [eerie music] - [Michael] Hi Connie, do we have soccer today? - Holy shmolly. - Michael! Where's your hair? - What's wrong with my hair? - You don't any. - Don't panic. Just sit down here and... and let me think thing through. - But Dad, he's-- - Shut up, Suz! It's the cat. It's that damn cat. I'm gonna ring its neck. - No, Dad, no, not the cat! - [Billy] It was on his head all night, wasn't it? Let go! The thing might have rabies! - Connie, do I have any hair at all? - [Billy] Puss, puss, puss, puss! Pablo! - Not much. - Oh. - Tell you the truth, none actually. Here, take a look. - I'm bald. I really am bald. [dramatic piano music] - Am I gonna get blamed for this too? [sobbing] - Dad. - Mike, Mike, feel my chin. Smooth as your scalp, right? But what's it gonna be like tomorrow morning? Come on. - Rough and stubbly. - That's right. And what's your head gonna be like tomorrow morning? Hmmm? - Rough and stubbly too? - You're darn right it is. Rough as sand paper. And if it's not, we're off to Dr. Einstein Epstein, quick as a wink. All right? - Wanna see my pet aunt? [laughing] - He's dead. - [Connie] How could he be dead? I just fed him. - [Announcer] Dr. Kaufman, Dr. Kaufman. Wanted in the operating theater immediately. - [Michael] I had hair the last time you saw me. Don't you remember? - Great balls of fire! There's not a whisker left. Huh? - The cat slept on his head last night. We think he caught something from it. - Cats give rashes, cats give fleas. Cats can transmit all sorts of disease. - So could it be the cat? - He is no cat. Huh? He had a fright, you say? - [Billy] That's right, he did. - It's that fright, for sure. The proper medical term is Hair'em Scare'em. - [Michael] "Hair'em" what? - Scare'em. Here, let me show you what I mean. Now, imagine that these fingers are you hairs or this desk your scalp. Okay, now, on the head, solid as a rock. Now, Michael, give me a good fright. Come on, bimbo, a really doozer. - Oh, boo. - "Oh, boo" to you too. Come on, put some noodles in it. - Faker! [whimpering] - Boy, oh boy. I really felt that. Where you watching what happened? Huh? The fingers? One moment, they're all there hanging on to the desk, along came a fright and bam, they all go away. The same as your hairs. One minute they're there, the next minute, all gone. - What a loony. - [Suzie] So his hair will grow again? - Sure, sure. Now just give it a chance, huh? Don't scare the pants off him. You must keep him happy, huh? No stress. - [Michael Voiceover] Dad thought my head was pretty nifty. Yeah, he wanted to do a series called "Bald Is Beautiful." I said, "Forget it!" [yelping] - Sit down. [chuckling] What's wrong with your friend, Michael? He's away from school, no? - I don't know, sir. - He's not very well, is he? - I don't know, sir. - He has a problem, you know. - No, sir, please, can I go? - So, you don't know that there is something very funny about this problem? - No, sir, what problem, sir? [chuckling] [school bell ringing] [chuckling] [eerie chiming music] [heavy breathing] [whimpering] - What? What's going on? Oh God, Mike, what're you doing? It's 3AM. - [Michael] Dad. - What? - I had a dream, Dad. I was climbing up to the fray. But again, Dad, I couldn't see it. I gotta see it, Dad. - Look, don't worry about it, Mikey. Nature's wonderful, it'll come back when it wants to by itself. - I wish Mom were back. - Mike, she's gone to sell Grandpa's house. - Can I ring her at least? - Mike. Now what good is that gonna do? It's only gonna upset her, isn't it? Come on, come on, just snuggle down in here. - Signor, I must have a serious talk with you. I've had a call from little William's mother. He's been having nightmares every night this week. - Oh, Jim, naughty Jim. Very sorry. He loves it. Nightmares? What that doing with me? - Little William says you give him wolves for his walls. - Oh, little nightmares but he daydreams in class. [laughing] Miss Prume. Dear Miss Prume, you don't know the terrible battle I fight everyday against imagination. Their heads are in the clouds. I tell them to draw dogs and they draw fires. [dog whimpering] - Signor, I've had my doubts about you and I've been checking. - What checking? - I found out that you've been thrown out of two schools, that you faked famous paintings and that you've changed your name and appearance four times. And you claim to be Rembrandt's great, great, great, great grandson. - I am a great teacher. I am a great artist. I am a great, great, great, great grandson! [yelling in foreign language] You are sausages here! Ignorant sausages! - I think you mean "savages." - I don't care, I go! Hate you savages! Hurry, Jim. [groaning] [drum banging] [pleasant classical piano music] [loud drum banging] [pleasant classical piano music] [loud drum banging] - Hi Mike, guess what. The Signor's been sacked. - Go away, Connie! I do not want any visitors! [banging drums] - [Suzie] Michael! - [Michael] And what do you want? - He's only trying to be nice. - I look disgusting! You hear?! Disgusting! [banging drums] [cymbals crashing] - Okay, just quick, slip it on, slip it on. - No, I don't want a wig! - Come on, Mike, it's for your own good! Quick, slip it on. Mike, listen to me, listen to me for just a minute. - No, it's fake! - It's for your own good we're doing this, you silly kid. Do you wanna stay in the house for the rest of your life? Hold still for one minute and let her slip it on. Just for a second. If you don't like it, we'll take it right off again. It's hair. Open your eyes, look in the mirror, it looks great. Take a look. All right. So? - But it comes off. - Listen, just a little dab of this. - A dibble-dab of glue will do you. - [Suzie] Magic glue. - Dear. - [Suzie] And. - And. Okay, show him, look in the mirror. Looks great. All right. - You're right, it's solid. - Sure it is. Solid as a rock. [laughing] - Wow, it stays on! I'm so happy! - [Suzie] And it's guaranteed for 30 days. [piano glissando] Not to come off your head. [laughing] [upbeat music] - [Boy] Come on, Mike, way to go! All right! Woo! [cheering] - Yeah, all right, woo! You see the guy back there? - [Michael] Blonde guy? - You better watch out for him. He's mean and dangerous. [whistle blowing] [upbeat music] - [Boy] Let's go! Go, Mike, go! Come on! Come on! [whistle blowing] [cheering] [whistle blowing] You foul! You foul! - You tripped me! - [Boy] Come on, Mike, swing at him! Swing at him, come on, get up and swing at him! [ominous music] [dramatic music] [laughing] [boys chanting] ♪ Hey, look at baldy without his stupid wig ♪ ♪ Better get another one, better make it stick ♪ ♪ Run away, baldy, run away quick ♪ ♪ Run home to mommy, hard boiled egg ♪ ♪ Hey, look at baldy without his stupid wig ♪ [crying] - [Michael] That stupid wig! [screaming] [knocking] - Michael, I brought you some food. - [Michael] Magic glue, eh? - It's something you like. - Ha, never comes off! Hi, I'd like to know what time it is in Australia. I wanna make a call. [eerie music] Nevermind, it's okay. [eerie music] [gasping] [laughing] [man spitting] - [Whino] Hi there, young baldy. - Hi. - Don't you remember me? [spitting] Excuse me. You helped me once. The last person who ever did. And this is Mary. [humming tune] Yep. We got sizzled up the very next night in that fire. We felt so guilty about you. Didn't we, Mary? - But you can't just come into our house, can you? - Oh, we can because we're ghosts. Ghosts can go anywhere. [Mary laughing] - Don't do that, you'll wake my dad and he'll throw you out. - Ah, they won't hear nothing. Ghosts make no noise. You only hear it because you see it. Shut your eyes a second. [silence] [thudding] - You're right. I didn't hear anything except for the last one. - You see? Imagination. Wonderful, isn't it? Anyway, sit you down. Mary's got something for you. [humming tune] - How'd you get to be, you know, a rubby-dub? - I had gotten the bottle. - [Mary] Where did I put that thing? - Were you a kid once, like me? - Oh yeah. Lots of brothers but the bottle got me. I'm the black sheep. [chuckling] - Here it is. Here's old Charlie's recipe. Let's see now. No you don't. This here's my last treasure. You can learn it but you can't have it. All right, here we go. "One really ripe banana." Come on, say it. "One really ripe banana." - [Michael] "One really ripe banana." - "Put it on my head." You have to say "put it on my head" after each thing! You ain't very bright, are you? - "One really ripe banana, put it on my head." - Good. "Five dead flies." - "Five dead flies, put it on my head." - No, no, no, no. Put "them" on my head. Don't you learn no grammar in school? - "Five dead flies, put 'them' on my head." - Good. - Come on, Mary. - "One rotten egg." - [Michael] "One rotten egg, put it on my head." - "Three liquorish leaves." - [Michael] "Three liquorish leaves, put them on my head." - Hurry it up, Mary. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. "A fist-full of kitty litter." - "A fist-full of kitty litter." - "Three connie crisps." - "Three connie crisps." - "Three crosby crackers." - "Three crosby crackers." - "Nine spoons of soil." - "Nine spoons of soil." - And "a glass of pepper spizz." - [Michael] What's pepper spizz? - Oh, it's mouth water. The biggest mouth water in the world. - Put it all on my head. - [Whino] We gotta go, Mary. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, last thing is a spoon full of peanut butter and that's very important because it makes it all stick together. But don't use too much of it or watch out. - [Michael] What'll happen? - Well, it ain't for me to say. You just watch out, huh? And watch your hands. Don't get it on your hands. It's libel to grow hair on your hands if you get it on them. - My hands? - On your nose. - My nose? - Sure. Anything. [laughing] - I hope it works, baldy. [somber chiming music] - [Suzie] Dad, he's digging up earth. You don't think he's gonna eat it, do you? - [Billy] Beats me, Suz. I've heard pregnant women get a craving for earth sometimes. - [Suzie] He couldn't be pregnant, could he? - [Billy] Unlikely, I'd say. - And last but not least, a glass of pepper spizz. [sizzling] [blender buzzing] - Got you! Throw it down the toilet, quick! Quick! - Don't! - Mike, I'm sorry. We couldn't let you drink that. That stuff could kill you. - I wasn't gonna drink it! - No? [toilet flushing] - [Boy] No, you go get it! I'm not moving. [Suzie laughing] - Right there, right there. Ah! - [Boy] Aw, right into the garden. [pleasant chiming music] - [Mary] Ah, the boy who forgot my recipe. - Please tell it to me again. It really wasn't my fault. - That's life, sweetheart. You don't get no second chance. - Don't be so hard on him, Mary. I've seen lots of people give you second chances. - So what? Sometimes I'm nice but sometimes I'm mean. I never know myself which it's gonna be. Looks like tonight it's mean, ain't it? - Well, if you won't be good, I'll have to make you, Mary. Here, kid. Best of luck. - Nutmeg. Three corsby crackers. Okay, let's start with the flies. Five dead flies. [jazzy music] - [Billy] Dibble-dabble will do it. Nearly done. [clinking] [crackling] - [Michael Voiceover] Oh, what a smell. [whispering] [jazzy music] Wow. I'm gonna put this stuff on my head? I must be crazy. Oh no. I'll have hair on my face. On my hands. I've gotta make it less runny. I just gotta put more peanut butter in. That's the only solution. Two, three, four, five spoons of peanut butter. That's enough. [pleasant piano music] Hey, it works. This has to be right. I'm a better painter than Dad. [birds chirping] - [Suzie] Coffee's ready, Dad. Is that me? I look like I'm trying to swat flies. I'm sorry, Dad, but nobody holds a racquet like that. - If I wanted real, I would've taken a bloody photo. Well, I was gonna give it to you for your birthday but maybe you don't like it. - Dad. [chuckling] - That's Mom and that's Michael. The brat. [shower trickling] - Nothing. Not even a hair. I'm sorry I was so mad at you last night. - Oh, you scared me. What's that on your head? - I don't have anything on my head, I just took a shower. - Wait a minute, look. You've got something on your head. Wait. - But I washed it off. - Where is that darn thing? Dad! [pleasant music] You've got little baby bristles. - [Michael] You sure it's not guck? - No, it's hair! It's hair! Dad! Dad! - [Billy] Okay, what's the matter now? - [Suzie] Dad, so glad you're here! Michael's got hair! - All right, Mike! All right! This is it, buddy! The nightmare is over! I told you so, nature's wonderful. Spring is sprung and the leaves are budding and the flowers are shooting and your head got the message. - So did your chin, Dad. [laughing] - All right, buddy. [knocking] Uh oh, hide the grapes, he's the human flea. Come on in, Connie. [entry bell ringing] - That's right, Connie, I have hair! - Congratulations. I'm so happy for you. - Oh, my head's tingling all over. - Oh God, it's growing a hundred miles an hour. - I wanna see it in the mirror too. [pleasant music] - Wow. - Oh, wow! Look at this! - Okay, Mike, out with it or it's the end of a great friendship. - What do you mean? - The truth, come on, what'd you do? - Oh, look at that, I can almost see it growing. - Quit stalling. Now how did you make it grow? - This. My secret recipe. - Yeah, where'd you get it? - It's a long story, tell you later. - Put that on your head? Did it hurt? - No but it's dangerous. - Let me try it. - Why? You don't need it, you got lots of hair. - Sure, but... - But what? - Well, I wanna put some down there. - Are you crazy? No, now get out of here and let a guy do what he's gotta do. - You're crazy. Absolutely crazy. - [Suzie] Who's crazy? - Connie. [laughing] - It's unbelievable. - What? - It's growing so fast. - It's true, it's so long. - Dad, could I call Mom? - Sure. - Thanks, Dad. Dad, the country code for Australia is 0-1-1-6-1-2? - [Billy] That's right. - [Michael] Hi, girls. - He's back. Probably with another one of his wigs. - No, it isn't, look. You can see his scalp. - Yuck, he's got dandruff. - [Connie] See? If it was a wig, would he have dandruff? - I guess not. [school bell ringing] - Mom said you have to come home right after school. - Okay. - [Man] Decimal point here and 25 and 56 of twice. And we bring down the six and we remember to move the decimal point and 25 into 56 goes two times. [girls giggling] Two times 25 is 50, quiet class. And we bring down the six. [giggling] - [Girl] Stop it. [giggling] - Leave his hair alone, girls. - Mr. Gingras, it's moving. - [Connie] But it's alive, sir. - It's not moving. It's just too long. - It was short this morning, sir. - Nonsense. What kind of a dodo do you take me for? [students giggling] Human hair grows only half an inch a month. No more. - Not my hair, sir. - He's gonna love this. It's his favorite. Taranto Noodle Soup. - Mmmmmm. [laughing] - Oh hi, Connie. Where is he? - What timing. - Now that's a head of hair. Well done, son. - I don't think it's natural, Dad. It grew six inches on the way home. - Well, it'll settle down. Don't worry, it's young, it's frisky. Come on, to the table, everyone. - [Michael] Oh, excuse me. - Lady and gentlemen, a toast to this new hair. - To the new hair. - To the new hair. - Long may it grow. - [Suzie] On my head too. [chuckling] Oh. [giggling] Don't worry, I'll clean it up. - Can you cut my bangs? - What? - Can you cut my bangs, please? - But it's so beautiful. Don't you realize I'd do anything for hair like this? - Don't cut it. You could make the world's Guinness book of records. - [Michael] Please? - If you insist. - The longest human hair known on this world grew up to be 28 feet on a guru. [chuckling] - Conrad, I owe you an apology. I have not been nice to you. - [Connie] It's okay, Mr. Baskin. - Oh. All right. How was it at school when he came back? - They thought it was another wig but then I showed them his dandruff. [Billy chuckling] - [Billy] Good lad. - Now, class, I want you to enter these last two equations in your exercise books and do them along with me. 11 into 67 six times. Six times 11, 66. And we bring the one down. And the six. 11 into 16, one. Okay, you two, this is a classroom, not a barber shop. And 11 into 16, we've done that now... 11, right, and five and we bring down the other. Okay. Down to Miss Prume, both of you. - Sir, for two weeks now I've been bald. We did everything to get my hair back. Nothing worked. At last I tried this extremely dangerous mixture. It worked but now my hair won't stop. My only chance is for this guy to keep on cutting. Please let me stay. I want to be educated. [applauding and cheering] - [Gingras] Quiet. - Not just hairy. [applauding] - Quiet! Out. And move it! [giggling] - I'm sorry, boys, the snipping is too distracting. I've had three teachers tell me today they'll resign if you go back in their classes. So finish your class and then you better go home. And you, Connie, I think you've got a problem too. - Holy shmolly. [sinister laughing] [silly music] [groaning] It's itchy. It's unbearable. Stop. I said, stop. Stop growing right now. Stop! [somber chiming music] [dogs barking] [eerie music] - Oh, please, stop. Please, please, let me alone. [ominous music] - Look at him! [laughing] [dogs barking] [menacing music] [groaning] [gasping] [wind howling] - Yuck. - Where you going? - [Michael] To school. - You can't go to school, Mike. They've phoned they don't want you there. Come back! - [Michael] No! - [Suzie] Your hair is trailing on the ground! - They don't want you there, Mike! - I don't care! [dramatic music] [wind howling] [ominous music] [Signor speaking foreign language] [eerie music] - [Billy] Oh God! [ominous music] [groaning] [sinister music] Oh God. [eerie music] - So, Connie, what're we gonna do? - How should I know? I don't know everything, you know. - Well you should know. You started it, going to that old house. So dumb. - That's a lie. He climbed into the thing, not me. Anyways, why don't your father do something? He's always telling people what to do. - Dad's no use. He blames himself. You know what he's done? He ripped up a half dozen paintings and broken all of his paint brushes. - Really? - Really. I think he's gone mad. - It's not his fault. 20 other kids are missing from school. - 20? I thought only 10. - No, 20, including Mai Ling, my baby sister. - Oh, that's terrible. You know, if we could only get Dad going. Dad's real smart, you know. He's a 100 times smarter than those old cops. - Anyways, how do we get him into gear, how? Just tell me how. - Hey, I've got an idea. - Why don't you give your dad one of these? That'll cheer him up. They're very new and they're very special. But they're really expensive, I'm afraid. 20 bucks each. - Wow. - Well, you know, think about it for awhile. - How do we know he won't break this one? Then that's 20 bucks down the drain. - 20 dollars is a small price to pay if it'll make him normal again. But this isn't his kind of brush. It's weird. It's flimsy. Connie, feel this hair. - So? - It's hair! - Bristles, hairs, what's the difference? - I know this hair. I cut this hair. - Are you certain? - We're holding a bit of Michael in our hands. - Excuse me, sir, where do these come from? - I don't know. Fellow in a big red truck delivers them. And I don't know his name. - Do you know the name of the company? - Company doesn't have a name. Look, if you wanna buy the brush, fine. Otherwise, let me get on with my work. - Please, please, it's a matter of life and death. - Okay, out, let's go. - Hold your horses, mister. We're buying the brush. Give him the money, Suzie. - Okay. Two, five, seven, eight. Nine, ten, twenty. - [Man] Thank you. - Exactly enough. - Oh, wait, let me see. When I asked for his name, he says, "I don't have a name." So I says, "What do I call you?" He says, "Call me Signor." - [Both] The Signor! - When I says, "When can I expect deliveries?" He says, "On Saturdays." - [Both] Tomorrow is Saturday. - Indeed it is. All day long. - [Connie] Let's go, Suz! - Thank you. [somber piano music] Connie, it's the red truck. Wake up! It's the red truck! It's there. It's here, come on! It's what we're waiting for! Look! Go! Hurry! Come on! Connie, come on. Come on. Come on. Don't drop the sugar. Get in! Good luck! - Hello, little girl, you want to come for a ride? - No thank you, I prefer my bike. - Ah.

A spy from Miss Prume, huh? - No, an inspector from the kidnapping division! - Yeah, a kidnapping division. Come with me, come! [ominous music] Come, Jim! [mumbling in foreign language] [children shouting] Quiet! Or I'll put you in the net. So, Inspector. Come and inspect. The first and only magic brush and hair factory in the world! - [Connie] Holy shmolly. - So, Inspector, you will never come again in my class, huh? [chuckling] Well, now you are in the class, which I never dismiss. - Oh yeah? I'm gonna escape and I'm gonna free all your prisoners. - But why? They love me. Don't you, children? - [Kids] Yes, Signor. - You see? You have come for nothing, Inspector. [laughing] But know what I am saying. You can make brushes. Sit down, Connie, sit down. Jeremy, show him what to do. I go to make deliveries. - Mai Ling! - Have you really come to rescue us? - Of course. - Meanwhile, you better start making brushes. - We have to make 500 a day or we won't eat. - How do I do it? - Look, take this piece and stick it in the handle like this. - Like this? - [Michael] Signor! - Wow. - [Michael] Signor! - Does all this come from Michael? - [Girl] Yeah, the Signor has him on a special yogurt diet. - [Michael] Signor! - [Connie] How'd he get you all? - [Boy] Through lies. - [Girl] Through hypnosis. - [Boy] Through ice creams that put you asleep. [shushing] - He's listening. There's microphones. There's one way to escape but it's no good. [ominous piano music] - Wow. [birds chirping] Fantastic. - Yeah, he makes them with his own magic paintbrushes. [birds chirping] - [Connie] Jim! - [Mia Ling] He always does Jim. [water trickling] - You know these paintings? They're so real, you can just walk right into them. - [Connie] So why not escape? - [Boy] It wouldn't work because Jeremy tried it once but he had to come back. - Why? - 'Cause they're all imaginary places, you know? He never painted a real place, you know, something like a town or a road or a street or anything like that. - [Connie] Hmmm. The Signor is a tougher cookie than I thought. - [Both] The Rabbit's your brother? - The Rabbit? That's cute. Yes, he's my brother. The other one, he's in art too. Sergio we used to call him when we were kids. A loony. A loony, Sergio. Now he's got no name at all, imagine that. No name. Just "The Signor." - [Both] The Signor? - Yeah. He's no rabbit. A fox, maybe. The Signor is the one who has kidnapped Michael and probably 20 other kids. - Your other brother, the Rabbit, he must know where he is. - Maybe he does but Arthur is not going to help you if Sergio don't want it. They're very close. They're twins. - You wanna bet he won't help? - [Suzie] You said they're twins? They don't look at all like each other. - [Epstein] Well of course they're not identical twins. - He better be here. - Billy, Abe and Suzie. How nice to see you. What a surprise. My goodness, to what do I owe this? - Okay, Arthur, where's your brother? - Well, he's right beside you. - Not that one, the other one. - Ah, the other one, he died I think. - Not that one, the other one, damn it. - He means Sergio, the Signor. - Oh, the Signor. I have no idea. - Cut the crap, you're buying paintings from him! - Paintings down with my brother's hair! - Believe me, I don't know! - Spill it, you sniveling rat! - You have to spit it out. There are 20 kids missing. - But he won't give me any more if his pictures. He's here Fridays. - Fridays. Fridays? - It's only Tuesday. Fridays. [sighing] [snoring] [ominous music] - Where you going, Connie? - I'm gonna see Michael. - You can't. That floor is full of tripwires. They're invisible. You can't go, you touch one, he's gonna wake up. - Then I won't. - I already told you, they're invisible. - Look, I came here to save Michael, okay? - [Boy] Okay, take my invention. It's invisible string detector. - What's he doing out of bed? [ominous music] [snoring] [snoring] [Connie whimpering] - [Connie] Holy shmolly. - Signor, is that you? - No. [shushing] It's me, Connie. I've come to get you out of here. - Is it really you? You're a wonderful friend. But what's the use? - Don't talk like that. - I mean, all this hair. [shushing] And this hair has some use. The Signor tells me they're making wonderful pictures. - Yeah, disgustingly beautiful. Your dad would puke. [sinister music] - Oh ha! Good evening, Inspector. Working late? - Hold on, Michael, I'll be back. [exciting beat music] [children shouting] - Wait, I'm coming to help you! Throw it, Conrad, throw it! - Mia Ling, stay back! [growling] - Leave my brother alone, you monster! Let me go! Let me go! [Signor laughing] - Okay, Signor. You win. For the moment. - Round and round goes the Inspector. Inspecting the ceiling, inspecting the walls, inspecting the floors. [laughing] - Oh, let me down. I'm gonna throw up. Please let me down. [ominous music] Please, Father. - I am not your father. I will let you down. No son. - [Connie] But I want you for my father. - This is some little trick, huh? - My real father died in a plane crash and I want you for my father. You're such a wonderful artist. What a wonderful teacher. - That is true now, that is true now. - What a fantastical liar. - I am rid of this. [speaking foreign language] [sighing] - Is your father really dead? [shushing] - Please let me be your son, please. - I will consider it. I never had children. Only dog. Now back to work. Artists everywhere are waiting for our brushes. My son. Children, I have been asked to demonstrate the art of magical painting which is to do something that I've never seen and with no photograph. My son will give me a subject and in one minute or less, it will appear on the biggest canvas. I am ready, my son. - Could you possibly do Michael's Fright, Dad? - Michael's Fright. What is that? - The thing that made his hair fall off in the burnt out building. The Fright. - Burnt out building? A burnt out building, that's all? That's so easy. [laughing] [somber music] Wait a minute. Wait. And how about that, huh? [giggling] [pleasant music] - Wow. [gasping] [children giggling] [singing tune] [laughing] [clapping] - Is wonderful, no? For you, my boy, just for you. - I'm sorry, Dad, but that's not the Fright. That's just where it took place. - But brushes don't know the Fright. They don't see the Fright. - But the painting is so real, Dad. We can get into it. Let's go up to the window and see. Here, I'll go first. - No, no, no. Get back, my son. It could be dangerous. No, no, stay back. It could be dangerous. Stand back, children. I will go first, okay? [somber piano music] [children giggling] You see, my boy, it's easy. [laughing] - Great, Dad. - He's pretty brave. - [Connie] You're not only a great painter, Dad, you're a great climber! [ominous music] - I am almost there. - [Connie] Look inside. [Signor yelling] [children screaming] [ominous music] - What happened to him? - He's seen the Fright. - But is he still going to be your father? - No, he was never my father, okay? It was just a trick to get him to see the Fright. - But he was nice after he became your father. - What's the matter with you all? What about the things he's done to you? Have you forgotten already? [suspenseful music] - Can you believe it? After a week of searching, I actually found my sugar. [ominous music] This must be it! Dad! Dad! - [Michael] Get me out of here! Somebody! - Okay, okay, hold your horses. - The hair stopped growing. - Of course. The Fright just passed to somebody else. - Who? - It could happen to a nicer guy. - Watch out! So it was him who got the Fright? - [Connie] Yeah. Bring him into the toilet. Careful, that's my father. Don't get his pants dirty. That's his only pair. - I'm gonna go see what it was. - Are you crazy? - No, okay, I wanna look inside. It's all right. - Do you want this to start all over again? - It won't, believe me. [dramatic music] [cheering] - [Connie] Michael, you're just a showoff! [ominous music] [eerie music] [hissing] Michael! Michael?! [eerie music] - What? - Five dead flies! Wrong, dummy. 50 dead flies. [maniacal laughing] - Michael! What's happening in there? - Wrong again. 500 dead flies. Don't you learn no flies in school? - [Michael] But I know you. How could I've been scared of you? Anyway, you don't frighten me anymore, that's for sure. - Hi there, young hairy. - And you, are you gonna try to scare me too? Anyway, it doesn't work anymore. I suggest you keep it for people like the Signor. - You're a brave boy! You'll go far. - It's all right. [cheering] Look out behind you! [menacing music] - He's coming! [screaming] [suspenseful beat music] - [Jeremy] Don't stop! Run or he'll get us all! [Signor laughing] [suspenseful beat music] [yelling] - Let me go, egghead! Let me go! Come on, let me go! [Signor speaking in foreign language] [laughing] - [Michael] Here, watch out, I'm gonna try to break it open. - [Mia Ling] This should fix him. [Signor laughing] - [Children] Help! [screaming] - Sit there! [groaning] - [Mia Ling] The keys, boys! - Mia! You're extreme genius. [suspenseful beat music] - [Michael] Oh, hurry up! - [Mia] Hurry! [Signor groaning] [suspenseful beat music] - [Michael] He's coming! - [Signor] Stop! I said, stop! [Signor yelling] - Darn, it's locked! I already tried it, it's locked! - He's coming. - That was a trick. The real trick! You can't do that to me! You are my sons. You can't do that to me! You can't! Connie, Michael. - Freeze, Signor, our you're dead meat! You too! - Serigo! - [Billy] He's in here! - How could you? - Yes, how could you? All the trouble you caused. - Oh, please, please. Gentleman. My dog, can I have my dog? [dog whimpering] - [Michael] Dad! - Mike! All right. You okay? - Hi. - Come, I'll show you where the others kids are. - Sure. [pleasant music] - I missed you, Dad. - Well, I missed you too, buddy. And so did your sister, though she won't say it. Come on. - [Michael] Hey, do you know what I really discovered in that old spooky house? Was that the biggest part of the Fright was in your imagination. [pleasant music] - [Billy] All right! Home again, home again, jiggety-jig. Everybody out! [laughing] - Oh wow, look at the garden. - The flowers are taller. - Great to have you back, Mike! Okay, everybody inside.
