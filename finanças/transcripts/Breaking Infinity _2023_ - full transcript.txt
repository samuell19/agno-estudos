- Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. - Where am I? Crap. Hey, a little help in here? Who's out there? Who are you? - You should lie down. - I don't need to lie down. I need to know where the hell I am. - You're clearly unwell. - No, I am fine, I'm just... How bad was the accident? - The accident? - Yeah, I was in bandages and I was bleeding. - Where? - I had broken ribs. - You've got a slight hematoma. - No. I had cuts on my arm. I'm not imagining it, and my, my ribs were taped. - Do you remember what these bandages looked like? - I can't remember it. Why can't I remember it? - Open your eyes. Pupil responses are good. And follow my finger. - Enough. What is going on? - You were exposed to an intense electromagnetic field that's left you with partial amnesia and short-term memory loss. - Do I know you? - Do you have any memory of how you got here? - No. - Well, do you remember anything about the last 24 hours? - It's hazy. There, there was a fire and, and I was on a heath. - Mm-hmm, and how about your name? - Oh my name. Yeah, my name is... What the hell? - It'll come back. Don't try to force it. Relax. - You relax. What is my name? - Liam. - What happened to me? - Well, there's a lot of people hoping that you can tell them that. The electromagnetic pulse that put you here also erased the event recorders in your lab. - What lab? Why was I in a lab? - It's best if the memories come back on their own. Right now, I want you to rest. There's a button on the IV for if you experience pain. Only holds one dose, so don't get your hopes up. - I won't need it. - You might. - Hey, how long have I been here? - Get some rest, Liam. - Screw this. Son of a bitch. What the hell is going on here? Damn it. Wait. I did that before. - Because I believe you? - If this man can remember how he did what he did, then it's worth the risk. - He's overdosing. Blood pressure? - 70 systolic. - Push 25 mil of ephedrine. Prep eight of naloxone. Liam? Liam. - Liam. - Can you hear me? Liam? I thought this machine could only deliver one dose. - It does. 60 systolic. - Crash carts! - He's flat lining! - Clear. - Where am I? - Listen. - Tell me where I am. - Where you need to be. - Where is that? - Here. - Welcome back. - I was floating. - I don't doubt it. You had a bad reaction to the morphine. - You mean I overdosed. - Not according to toxicology. - I pushed the button twice. - The machine can only deliver one dose. - Yeah, well, your machine's broken. - Your brain waves were in a similar state to someone who'd already received an opioid just before the machine dispensed its dose. It probably caused, um, a sympathetic reaction. - So my brain already thought I was on morphine, so I overdosed? - Not quite, but if it helps you to think of it that way, then please do. In the meantime, we've taken you off painkillers. - I was outside. There were stones. - That was probably a hallucination resulting from your state. - No, no, it wasn't a hallucination. It was real. I was dying. - Well, you're not dying now. - I still can't remember how I got here. - I'd like to help with that. Are you up for an experiment? Do you have somewhere to be? - What's your name? - Emma. I'm here to help you, Liam. Please believe me. - I don't have much of a choice, do I? - You always have a choice. Ready? - Seriously? - Tell me what you see. - A man in a straight jacket. How is this supposed to help me get my memory back? - It's just a diagnostic tool. Different people see different things. What do you see? - You asked me a question. Let me ask you one. Where am I? - You're in a Defence Science and Technology research facility. - What kind of research do we do? A butterfly wearing headphones? Well? - We do electromagnetic field research related to cosmic background radiation. I don't know much else. My clearance isn't that high. - The end of the world. - What? - It looks like a mushroom cloud from an atomic bomb. The end of the world. So what's your diagnosis? - Physically, there's nothing wrong with you. CT scans have ruled out brain trauma. Your pupillary responses and reflexes are good. Your psychiatric evaluation is normal. There's no reason why your memory should be so selectively impaired. - Selectively sounds like a polite way of saying deliberately. - Is it deliberate, Liam? There are basic things you should remember. - Yeah, like my name. What I really wanna remember is what happened to me. - You walked into a lab in this facility by yourself, then for reasons unknown, you stepped into an electromagnetic field strong enough to rip the molecules out of your body, only instead, you were found in Wales 180 kilometres west of here with no idea how you got there. And a lot of very powerful people want to know how you did it. How did you do it? - I don't remember. - Liam, are you okay? - Yeah. - Did something just happen? - Uh, no. I'm tired. I'd like to stop. Can I hold onto those? - Sure. - Listen. - Wake up! I remember something. - What did you remember? - Bandages. They were beige and white and there was tape here. I know you said it never happened, but I remember it. It felt real. - Mm-hmm. Any other symptoms? - I hear a hum. - High pitch or low? - Low. - Do you hear it now? - Yes. - It's not a yes or no question, Liam. - I'm sorry, what? - Liam, are you paying attention? - Oh, sorry. Did I hurt you? - No. Did you hear it? - Hear what? - The end of the world. What does this look like to you? I saw the end of the world just now. - Delusions can seem real. - The lab, wherever, whatever happened to me. Tell your bosses if they want answers. I need to go back. - Liam, that field caused your memory loss, exposing you to it again could do even more harm. - If I approve you going back to your lab, will it help restore your memory? - Mr. Carter, this is not... - Yes. - I'll make arrangements. - Carter, you can't just come in here and... - Doctor, if this man can remember how he did what he did, then it's worth the risks. And if you can't help me do that, I'll find someone who can. - Who was that? - Carter. He's one of the people who wants to know what you know. Apparently, he's willing to let you kill yourself in order to get it. - It's my choice. I wanna do this. - Okay, but I'm warning you. Carter and the others are scared. And powerful people can do scary things when they're scared. - They didn't spend much on signs here. - A secret program's easier to keep secret if it doesn't have a name. - Ignorance is bliss. - Is that what you believe? - Not always. You seem worth remembering. - Well, apparently not. - What is this place? - You recognise it? - Take your time. - This was the lab, but it was destroyed. - Liam, mate. It's me, Garret. He still doesn't remember. - Not yet. - You're looking really, really good, mate. - I'm not deaf. - I know, I know. I'm just glad to see you. - Is the field generator ready? - Ready, Freddy. Which is totally not your name. Yes. All good to go, sir. - And this is where I... - Where you went missing? Yeah. - We closed the lab down after the event. - You don't have to do this. - But when you're ready, we are on our schedule here. - It's cold in here. - We keep the field coils at about 20 kelvin. That's roughly -250 degrees celsius. - Next time I'll wear my jumper. - How are you feeling, Liam? - Like a goldfish in an ice bath. - If you don't mind, we're not here to talk about the weather. - Glad to see your sense of humour hasn't changed, sir. Okay. You can control the field generators from that column next to you, but with your memory being like Swiss cheese, I'll control them from in here. But if you want to tap out, you just press the red button. Any questions? - Will it hurt? - It shouldn't do. I've set the field harmonics to the level of a really thorough MRI. - And how about a chair? - Oh, I'm sorry mate. We can't have you fusing with any foreign objects. - Nobody mentioned that. - He's kidding. You are kidding, right? - Well, except for that one mouse in his wheel, yeah. He really doesn't remember anything? - That's what we're here to find out. - Poor bastard. Okay, we are all set. Field harmonics at 20%. Showtime. - Liam, when you go back, tell Carter it's the inverse square of C. - Are you insane? What are you doing? - Uh, watching us. - Oh, damn it, Liam. They'll find you. How's the bleeding? - Um, Better. I think. - I'll change your wrap and then we'll go. - Where are we going? - Jesus Liam, not now. I need you here in this moment. Where are you in this? What's the last thing you remember? - You took me to the lab and Garret turned on the device. - For the first time? Oh god. - I don't understand. - And you think I do? I'm going forwards and you are going, oh, God knows where. - Well, tell me where we're going now. - I'm following you. How screwed up is that? For the longest time I didn't believe you and now that I know that it's true, now that I know that the world's gonna end, you don't remember. There isn't any more time. If you go back, if you get another chance, change it. - Change what? - Everything. Don't think about me. Don't think about us. Just do it. - How? - If you don't know, I can't help you. I love you. - Where am I? - This is where you need to be. - What is that? - This is how I know I have been here before. - Liam. Liam, are you okay? - How long? - How long was the field on? - Yeah. - 30 seconds. You were in the field for 30 seconds. - Did you remember anything? - Your name is Emma. - Liam! - Welcome back. Do you remember me? - Yes. - Do you remember anything else? - We were in a hotel room. - Liam, that's not a memory. That's a fantasy. - It hasn't happened yet. - Liam, we've never been to a hotel and based on our history, I'd say it's pretty unlikely. - We have a history? - Don't read anything into that. - I saw the end of the world. - Well, you look pretty alive for a man who just saw the world end. - Yeah. Well, I woke up. I need to go back. - It's not up to me. - Carter will approve it. - Will he? - Tell him it's the inverse square of C. - What does that mean? - I don't know. Just tell him I said it's the inverse square of C. See what he does. - What are you remembering? - I don't know. Just tell Carter. - Yeah, I'll tell him. You rest. - Emma. I will find a way to change things. - Change what? - I don't know. - Who are you? - This is how I know I have been here before. - Did you tell Carter what I said? - I did. - And? - Carter's not the kind of man who telegraphs his feelings. Any headaches? - You need to push him to get me back into the lab. - Carter's also not the kind of man who lets himself be pushed. Hmm. Your pupils are dilated. Have you had any pain medication today? - No. That message was supposed to mean something to him. - Your reflexes are delayed. I'm gonna order a blood test. - I've given blood till I'm dry I don't need more tests. I need to get back into the lab. If I can figure out what caused the accident, maybe I can stop all of this from happening. - Even if I believe that you could travel through time, which I don't, that doesn't alter the fact you can't change the past. It's already happened. - It can change. I've proven it. - Does this have something to do with that toothpaste mess in the bathroom? - You're not listening to me. I need to get back into the lab. - Liam, if it was up to me you'd never set foot in that lab again. - Well then it's good it's not up to you. And I do go back. I've seen it. - Because it's where you have your accident in the future. Well, you're right. It's not up to me. Carter approved your request this morning. - Why didn't you tell me? - Because it's not healthy. I don't just mean the EM field. I mean your obsession with this and I don't trust Carter. - Forget Carter. I've set in motion a chain of events that I think could lead to the end of the world. To stop it I need to figure out what happened. - Liam, you can't change the past. All you can do is accept it and come to terms with it. - It's not about coming to terms with it. If I don't change the past, there won't be a future. - I've converted the control column to be a recording unit in the field with you. It should give us some indication of what kind of time dilation you're experiencing. - Assuming it doesn't fuse with me. - Or convert into pure energy and vaporise you. I'm just kidding, mate. With any luck, it'll give us enough data to control the field. - Meaning you could send me back to the original accident and I can prevent it. - Let's just focus on getting you back from wherever you go this time. Okay, all ready. - I wish you'd change your mind. - Yeah, and I wish you'd believe me. Garret, does the inverse square of C mean anything to you? - It's a field harmonic. We haven't tried it yet. - Try it. - You're the boss. - I might go back to a time before we've met. Any advice? - Don't hit on me this time. - I hit on you? Oh, I wish I'd remembered that. You still don't believe me, do you? - I'm a doctor, I need evidence not anecdotes. - Unfortunately, I don't seem to be able to bring back any souvenirs. - Well, that's convenient. - Ask me a question that nobody else would know the answer to. - Liam. - One question. If I answer it, you'll have to believe me. - When I was eight, I stole something from my sister's room. What was it? - You're a thief. - I hope this doesn't kill you. Just hurts a lot. - Same power level as before. Inverse field harmonics. Sound good? - As good as anything. - Please place your hand on the column. - Careful, mate. - What did you say the terawatt requirement on this gadget was? - I'm sorry, what gadget? - Just here ma'am. After you. - Bloody hell. - Are you alright? - I think Liam's just overwhelmed by the magnitude of his project and the, the trust the government is putting in him as chief scientist. Yes? - You want to explain what you've dragged us down here to see? - Liam? - Yes. It's a little technical. Garret? - Yeah, sure, sure. The laser cannon is aimed at the electromagnetic field, which is at the same resonance as the cosmic background radiation of the big bang, which means that the laser will travel from the very beginning of time to the end and back again and should reappear 15 seconds into the future. - Time travel. He is talking about time travel. - What the hell is going on with you? - Nothing is faster than light, but by manipulating time we can send it into the future or into the past. Glasses, everyone. - Bringing field coils up to speed. Liam. - Okay, do it. - Initiating test sequence in 3, 2, 1. Showtime. - Congratulations, Liam. - T plus thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. - What you have just witnessed is a beam of light being sent 15 seconds into the future. Imagine a message being sent weeks or months into the past. Imagine a bullet hitting its target fired by a soldier who has not even been born. That is the future. We're going to need to speed up the timetable of the crewed project. When can you be ready? - I'd have to check the numbers. - The appropriations committee need to see results, so our best bet is for a projection into the past to secure the funding. - What if we're moving too quickly? - Liam, I know this is your baby, but if you can't provide me with what I need... - You'll find somebody who can. I've heard it before. - You are invaluable to this project and I have believed in you and supported you when others didn't. We're on the verge of a breakthrough here and I'm not gonna lose out to the Chinese or Americans because you've got cold feet. - What if it's not safe? - If it was safe, defence wouldn't be interested. - No, I'm talking end of the world not safe. - What is there new data I should be aware of? - No. It's, it's just a feeling. - I want a timeline for a test, for a projection of a human into the past on my desk tomorrow. Bonus, if it comes from the future. - Emma. - Thank you. - Emma. - Do I know you? - No. There's, there's no reason that you should. - But you know me. - Yeah, we've met before. You just don't remember it, yet. I'm Liam. - Liam, I don't think we're supposed to talk to people we don't know in a secure facility. - I understand completely. I just need your help. - I'm a doctor. I get that line a lot. - No, I'm serious. I'm part of an experiment that is going wrong. - Are you now? What's your lab? - Eight. - Now I know we shouldn't be talking. Eight's a restricted level. You don't have access to it. - No, but if you get injured, come up and see me on five. At least wait until you're injured. - I won't remember you then. I need to talk to you now. - Too bad. - Door closing. - Goodbye, Liam. - Wait. I need to ask you a question. What did you take from your sister's room? Damn it. - What is this place? - Where it ends. - Why am I here? - Listen. - Liam. I've got you. - Emma. Your name is Emma. - That's right. - I wasn't hitting on you. I was asking for your help. - What? - I think I better give you two a minute. - No. - No, when we first met. You were walking down the corridor. I called your name. You didn't recognise me. You asked what lab I worked in. - That's how we met. You're remembering. That's good. - No, no, no. It's just happened. We just spoke. You got into the lift and I tried to ask you the question. - That was two weeks ago. Call medical. - No. I need to go back. - You need to rest. - No, I went somewhere that meant something. There was, there was an old man and he was near some stones and there was a spiral on one of the stones. - Was that in a valley? - Yes. Do you know it? - No. No. I mean there's lots of places like that. I've called the medical team, Doctor. - It was probably something you remember from your childhood. Or something you saw in a documentary or jumbled up with your emotions. - No, he showed it to me for a reason. - Who showed it to you? - The old man. He said I needed to be there when it ends. - When what ends? - The world. I think. - He's hallucinating. - I am not hallucinating. I am remembering and I need to go back right now. - If you don't calm down, you're going nowhere apart from hospital. Tell me why you think you need to go back right now. - You think my brain is just throwing images around until they stick. Okay. But I remember Carter saying that there was gonna be a crew test. Why would I risk my life in coming here alone if there was already gonna be a test? - Are you saying that what happened to you wasn't an accident? - I don't know. Maybe. But I won't know unless I go back and find out. - Absolutely not. - Um. - What? - Th-this says that you were gone for over three hours. - How is that possible? It was less than 30 seconds. - What else did it record? - It picked up a wifi signal. Date and time. The internal clock thinks it's two weeks ago. That was the day of the test. - It's not worth risking your life over. - This isn't where I die. I know that. But if I don't go back now, I might not get another chance. - Alright, but I'm not having you kill yourself. 30 seconds and we switch the field off. - Okay. Just now, please. - That clock has got to be wrong. - It's an atomic clock. It sheds a 10th of a second every 10,000 years. If the clock's wrong, there really is something wrong with the universe. - Okay, do it. - Did something just happen? - Christ, this hurts. - I can't give you any more painkillers. There's no telling how much your system thinks it has in it from the other timelines. Might send you into sympathetic shock. - Where are we? - About 30 kilometres outside of Cardiff. We'll stop in town and pick up some medical supplies. I need to change that dressing. - There's a hotel just off the main road. - Have you been there before? - No. I remember it. Why are you here? - Because I believe you. Unless the world really does end, in which case it won't matter. - I've been here before. I'm supposed to do something. What am I supposed to do? - Look at me. Your pupils are dilated. Oh, I wish I had your test results. - Results! - What the hell are you doing? - Providing results. - Liam, when you go back tell Carter it's the inverse square of C. - Are you insane? - Now Carter approves me going back to the lab. - Oh Jesus, Liam. Where are you in this? - What's that? - A butterfly wearing headphones. - I'm worried about you. - It's nothing, do you have any idea why you would drive me to Wales? - No. I have no idea why I would drive you to Wales. - When can I get back into the lab? - Carter and the others want to let you. I'm against it. - Why? - While you were unconscious, I put you through a CAT scan. I want to see the results before I sign off on any more exposure. - How long? - Tomorrow? - That's too late. - Liam, I know you think that regaining your memory is the most important thing, but there's more to you than memory. You have the ability to reason, to think, to feel. It's more important than remembering. - If I can't remember what I am supposed to do, none of this will exist. - Liam, the world will exist whether you remember it or not. - What if you're wrong? - That's enough for today. I'm gonna try again tomorrow after I see your test results. - There isn't any more time. If you go back, if you get another chance, change it. - Change what? - Who are you? - I'm worried about you. He's overdosing. Blood pressure? - 70 systolic. - Push 25 mils of ephedrine. Prep 8 of naloxone. Liam, can you hear me? - Blood pressure 60 systolic. - Crash cart. - He's flat lining. - Clear. Give me a reason, Liam. Give me something real. - Excuse me, Hi. I just wanna find out where the... - His EEG is showing rapid deterioration of the prefrontal cortex. The repeated exposure to the EM field is accelerating the process. - You said he regained more memories. - He's also suffering from hallucinations. He thinks he's seeing the future. - Your job isn't to analyse the results of this experiment. Your job is to help pull back more memories. - My job is to save his life. - Liam has devoted his life to this project. He knew what the dangers were the moment he stepped foot in the laboratory and he is the only person who can tell us how this experiment works. - And he's dying. - Then make his sacrifice meaningful. He travelled 180 kilometres through space instantly. If what you say is true, then he is travelling through time. Think what that means. - I'm thinking about a human being. - And I'm thinking about all of humanity. Have you any idea what this technology means? It means we can predict disasters before they happen. It means we can stop wars. It changes everything. - And if he dies? Do you think that's worth the price? - Doctor, that is not your decision to make. - Hi. - I have the results of your scan. The EM field is destroying the parts of your brain responsible for cognitive function. If you carry on, you'll wind up a vegetable. - I understand the risks. - You sound like Carter. - Carter is right. - You don't know that. - I heard you and Carter talking when I was being scanned. - Liam, you were unconscious in another part of the facility. - Carter said that I devoted my life to this project and I knew the risks when I walked into the lab and he was right. - There's no way you could have overheard that. - I am stuck in a quantum state and I don't how to get out of it. I do know that if I don't figure it out, the world will end. - Liam, I don't pretend to understand quantum states, but I do understand the human body. If you keep doing this, you will die. - I remember how we met and I remember being with you at the end of the world. You told me to change things, not to think about you or us just to change things. - Liam, it's not a memory. - I don't expect you to believe me now, but you believe me then. You believed I could still do it. - Do what? Liam, did something happen between us in your quantum state? You said I told you to change things not to think about me or us. What us is there, Liam? I think it's best if I stop being your doctor. I can't stop you from destroying yourself, but I can choose not to be a part of it. - Garret. What are you doing here? - I've got something to show you, mate. I ran the numbers after your last trip. The whole cosmic background radiation is changing. - The CMBR can't change. It's a remnant of the bing bang. - Yeah, that's why I ran the numbers again. It's changing. - Did you tell anyone? - I told Carter and he locked me out of the lab. But you've still got access. - And Carter doesn't know you came for me? - Nobody does. - Good. - There. Right there. Something happens to the cosmic background radiation. Before that it's static and then after that... - There's a pattern. - Exactly. And when I put it through the analyzer. Listen for yourself. - What the hell? - I'm not into folk music, but that is freaky. - And that goes on for? - For three hours and 17 minutes. The same three hours and 17 minutes that you were in the field. - Can you figure out what it is? - It's a repeating pattern that corresponds to a precise location in the space time matrix. - You're gonna have to spell it out for me. - It's a map, mate. It's a bloody map to the universe. - That's what the old man was trying to tell me. - The old man you said showed you the stones and the spiral? - Yeah, that's right. - Did it look like this? - Where did you get this? - I thought about it after you told me. I found it in my flat when I moved in. An old tenant must have left it there. - This site is over 4,000 years old. - If you're in a quantum state, there is no present, no future. It's just one big now. - Passing through every point in space and time at once. - The string theory. The whole universe is just a massive vibrating field all happening at the same time. Only time is unravelling. - What? - Before you did what you did, the pattern was in a steady state, an endless loop going on forever. But now. - The pattern is spiralling in on itself. - And when it reaches the centre. - Time ends. I keep seeing a flash of light, like an energy pulse that swallows the world. - Or the whole universe. - And it starts here. How long do we have? - I don't have enough data. - Do you have enough data to send me back to when the event occurred? - In theory. - Yes or no? - Yes, I guess if we can send you everywhere, we can send you back to when it starts. I've set the harmonics to where the two fields converge. If you can get to the lab, you can access the field generators from this column and change the setting to the inverse square of C. That should stabilise the collapse. - How do I do that? - Frequency adjust. Duration. Start. - And you built this? - Based on your work. I don't think anyone understands it as well as you do. God knows I've tried. Are you sure you want to go through with this without the doc here? - She made her choice. - I guess we all have. You ready? - Yeah. Hey, if this works. - You'll be back. Just try not to kill your own grandfather or anything, yeah? - Grandfather? - Sorry, bad time travel joke. Good luck. - Yeah, thanks. - You ready, mate? - Do it. Lab 8. When? Okay. Before the spike. Hey. Who left you in here? Hey, someone's in here. Wait! No! No! What am I supposed to do? - Listen. - Liam has devoted his life to this project. He knew what the dangers were the moment he stepped foot in the laboratory and he is the only person who can tell us how this experiment works. - But he's dying. - Then make his sacrifice meaningful. - This is where I need to be when the world ends. Can I stop it? - Liam? Liam, where are we going? Liam? - Here. - I'm taking you somewhere to stop that bleeding first. - No hospital. - No. No hospital. Give me a reason, Liam. Give me something real. - Wake up. - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. It's okay. - I was afraid I'd lost you. I thought you were... Have you done that before? - Yes. - When? - At the end of the world. - Can you stop it? - I don't know. It wasn't an accident. Someone locked me in and activated the device. - Well, who? - It must have been Carter. He needed a test subject and I was it. If I can go back, maybe I can stop him. - Then why are we driving into bloody Wales? - Because this is where we need to be. - According to who? - The old man. Maybe he's me. Maybe he's God. I don't know. I do know he knows where I'm supposed to be. - Is it here? When the world ends? - Yeah. Don't go back. - Remember when you said that even if I don't remember anything, the world would still exist? - Yes. - I think the world is memory. The present is everything that's led up to it. An echo of what's come before. Just endless repetition. - If you go back, you're going to die, aren't you? So in all of this endless repetition, do any of us have a choice? - We always have a choice. It's just knowing what to do with that choice. What did you steal from your sister's room when you were eight? - What? - I must have given you the answer. This is when you must have told me. Why else would you believe me? Why else would you be here? - Is that what you think. - Emma? - Don't. Just don't. After everything that I've been through to bring you here. But you don't remember any of that, do you? - To change things I needed to get here. - Well, we're here. Or at least I am. I don't where you are in your quantum flux. - Quantum state. - I don't give a damn what it's called. You brought us here because according to you, it's where the world ends. Well, I don't want it to end. I believed you. I believed in you. - Emma, you have to tell me what you stole from your sister's room when you were eight. If you don't, I can't get us here. And we need to get back here. - I don't have to do anything. - No, Emma. You have to tell me. - It won't change anything. - Emma. - I'm sorry, Liam. But this is my choice. - Carter. Garret. - I'm sorry, mate. - Liam. Liam. - It was you. - I wondered how long before you'd remember. - You locked me in. You activated the device. Why? - This was my project too, Liam. I wasn't gonna let you hand it over to Carter and the generals. - At night you were testing on the mouse to see if you could travel through time. - To go back before you could claim credit for everything. Before you could sell us out. But when you came into the lab, I, I panicked. I wasn't gonna let you stop me. - So you activated the field and put me into a quantum state. - Which started the collapse of the universe. - We have to fix it, Garret. - You're not the only one who's in a quantum state, Liam. I've seen the end of the world too. - You have to stop it. - There is not enough time here. But in the quantum state, I can live from the beginning of time to the end. I, I can figure this out. Me, Liam. Me, not you. - No. If time collapses, there won't be a future. There won't be a past. - I will have all the time in the universe. - I can't let you do this. - You don't have a choice, mate. - Everybody has a choice. - Welcome to forever. Listen. - Wake up. - Garret. - Hello, Liam. - Garret. You got old. - It's been a long time. You could say an eternity. I've had a long time to think. A long time. - It was you. - Yes. And here you probably thought it was your story. - You tried to kill me. - I was young, ambitious. I've grown up a bit. - This is forever. - You should see it, Liam. A landscape without automobiles. No roads. No bloody shopping centres. No change. - What happened? - It just goes on and on. You were right. There's no future here. No past. Just one long spiral into forever. - And what happens now? - You die I reckon. The world ends. Or you could stay here. - No, I need to go back. You need to help me. - I know. I don't have a choice. - Everybody has a choice. - I don't. I've been here forever. I've seen them all. Every choice. I'm sorry for what's about to happen, Liam. I truly am. If it's any consolation, we were mates once. - If you've seen every choice, what do I have to do? - You'll know. - This isn't where I am. - What? - This isn't where I am at the end of the world. - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. It's okay. - I was afraid I lost you. I thought you were... Have you done that before? - I wanted to ever since we met. - Where are you in this? The beginning? The end? - I'm here. - What happens next? - The world ends. - And this is where you need to be. - This is where I want to be. - Then it's where I want to be too. I never pictured myself in a cheap hotel in Wales at the end of the bloody world. Give me a reason, Liam. Give me something real. - What you stole from your sister's room when you were eight that's, that's not the answer I gave you that made you believe me. - No. You want me to tell you what it was? - I already know. I love you. I love you. - I love you too. - What are you doing here? - I followed you from the hotel. - This is now. - And now is all there is. And for the record, I stole five pounds and 23 pence from my sister's room. - Thief. - Oh, just here, mam. After you. - Glasses, please. Thank you. - Bringing field coils up to speed. - Okay, do it. - Initialising test sequence in 3, 2, 1. - System failure. System failure. Alert. System failure. System failure. - I am not sure what's happened. - It's an absolute disaster. They're pulling the funding. None of us will survive these budget cuts. There'll be an inquiry. Hope you got a good lawyer. - Door closing. Door opening. Going down. - Hi. - Do I know you? - No. - But you owe your sister five pounds and 23 pence.
