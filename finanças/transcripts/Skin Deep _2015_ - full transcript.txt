- Hey. - Hey, babe, sorry about last night. I got caught up, did you end up going? - No, I just had a quiet one. - Leah look, I can't take you into Newtown this morning. - Oh, that's cool, I'm sure my mum can take me. - Is that alright? - Yes. I can put up with mum for one trip, but do you think you can come and pick me up? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. - Thank you. ♪ Baby, you're always trying to bring us down ♪ ♪ Baby, you're always trying but never succeeding ♪ - Now we're going to Sam Weiss. Sam, thanks for waiting. - Thanks for having me. - Now Sam, you're one of the organizers of this Sydney leg of this protest. What, what is it, help us out? - It's an International Climate Change Rally that's gonna be happening in over 100 cities across 26 nations. - Do you remember those rallies I used to take you to when you were a little girl? - Mm-mm. - Oh, yes you do. Do you remember that one in Coffs Harbour? So is Luke definitely picking you up? - Uh-Huh. - Well, if he's not, I am perfectly happy to wait for you. Actually, I'd prefer it. - He's picking me up Mum, it's fine. - Well, we're estimating over a half million people will be gathered today. - This is just the cause for them to work. Alright, um, now just quickly wrap it up, Where, when, and how? - 6 p.m., Belmore Park. 6:30 we'll start speeches and at 8:30 we'll head on off. - And how's the rest of the routine going for you? - Good. Actually, really good. - Well, it's good to hear. What about side effects? Any extra headaches? - No. - Trouble sleeping? - No. - Too much sleeping? - Just the normal amount. - Okay, what about depression? Okay, cool. That's it for today. - Thanks. - Is Luke picking you up? - Yeah. Sorry, shit, I must have left my wallet at home, but I can come back and get them tomorrow. - Don't worry about it. We'll see you next week. Just bring it then, okay? - Okay. - Did I give you instructions on what order to take those in? - Yes, it's in my bag. Thank you. - Mm, you're welcome, sweetheart. Take care of yourself. - No, not this time. - Is not available right now. Please leave a detailed message. - Hey, don't think you can smoke here. - Am I smoking? - Did you call your mum? - No. - Caitlin, how many more times is it gonna happen? - Hey, Caitlin. You forgot your bag. - Oh, thank you. - You got rocks in there? - Just the books I need for tonight. - What are you studying? - Don't forget to put that oil on your stitches. - You know, we can't hold you here, but we can strongly advise that you stay. - She knows. - I've already filled out my paperwork. I'm studying psychology, by the way. - Hey, that's great, Caitlin. - Ironic is what it is. - Hey, it's me, leave a message. - Hey, it's me, I'm out, um, yeah, call me. Hey, um, I can't see you. Did I, did I get the place wrong? - Awesome. - Sorry, you're, you're probably driving. I'll text you. Hey. - Um, sorry, but this is mine. - Well, you didn't have to grab it like that. - Panicked. - I fucking hate, Newtown. - Haven't seen you in awhile. - Yes, I've been trying to be good and studying. Trying. - Big night? - Something like that. You? - I actually went to go see Isabel's band play. Sorry. What have you found? - Ah, The Sweet Little Army. - Wow, even I haven't heard of them. - So, how were they? - Who? - Isabel's band? - Oh, amazing. As usual. - Of course. - Cool, well that's $20 dollars. - Perfect. See ya, Bella. - Are you alright? - Hey, I, uh, just wanted to say sorry about before. - Don't worry about it. - Just, I, saw them like ages ago and I didn't buy it then, and I really regretted it, so. - Yeah, no, it's really fine. - You know them? - No. - That's a shame. Thought maybe I found the one other person in the world who did. - Nope, so you really weren't gonna have to fight me for it. - Anyway, um, sorry if I ruined your day. - Don't worry about it. - See ya. - Yeah, bye. - Hey, it's me. Leave a message. - Hey, it's me. Just wondering where you are or if maybe we got the time wrong? I don't have my wallet so I'm kinda stuck. I'm sure you're on your way, but if you could just give me a call or message or something. Love you, bye. - Do you need some help? - No, my boyfriend's coming to pick me up. He's just running late. - How late? - Coming up to two hours now. - Shit. - Yeah, well, he's always late. We live in Avalon, so it's far. - Where the fuck's Avalon? - Um, that way, but about two hours that way. - Well, I've got a bus ticket if you want? - Thanks, but I wouldn't even know how to catch a bus from here. - Seriously? I can look it up on my phone. - No, really, it's, I'm fine. - Okay. Wasn't that him? - Just Mum. - Hey, I'm gonna get something to eat. Do you want something? - No, thanks, but I'm really fine. - C'mon, you must be starving if you haven't had your wallet all day. - Yeah, well that's my fault for being an idiot. - We won't go far, it's just up there. I feel like a dick about before. The least I can do is get you a coffee or something, or if you really want, I can get you something and bring it back, but you shouldn't have to wait in the street. It's dirty and there are so many weirdos. - Yeah, there is. - Oh-ho, ouch - No, sorry, I didn't mean it like that. I've just been pissed off all morning. - Don't worry about it. I'm sorry I keep hassling you. I'm sure you don't need looking after. - What's that supposed to mean? What makes you think I need looking after? - Ah, actually, I said you didn't to be looked after. - Oh. Man, I must be coming across as the biggest bitch. - You are. But, it's okay, because you're pretty. It was nice to meet you, bitch. - Well, actually I am really hungry. - So how long have you been with your boyfriend for? - Coming up on three years. - Wow. Is he a good guy? - Of course, he's just not very good at being punctual. - Maybe he's just really good at being late. It takes talent to be two hours behind. Not just anyone can do that. - So, that CD you bought, you said that you saw the band live? - Yeah. It was like two years ago. And they were so good. They have this one song that I couldn't get out of my head for months. You know when you like so badly wanna hear a song again? It was like that but I'd forgotten it now. I tried to find them online, but I think they haven't put stuff up. It's literally like they just vanished straight after that gig. I even went back to the place where I saw them and tried to ask but no one knew, so I was pretty stoked when I saw that CD. - Well, it definitely went to the right person, then. - What kind of music do you like? - Different stuff. I mean, I like a lot of acoustic bands. Ah, I usually think the more instruments the better but even a lot of percussion is good, but you know, if the voice is strong, I'll pretty much love it. - Well, you'll definitely like these guys, then. - Yeah, well, I'm intrigued now you've talked them up so much. - I'll burn it for you. - Now? - After we finish eating. I just live around the corner. - Thanks, but he'll be here any minute, so. - This is the one. - Have you read all these books? - Yep. - Have you seen all these bands? - Yeah. - Wow. I've never even heard of most of them. - I used to date this chick who was a drummer, so I used to go to a lot of gigs. - Are you still studying? - Yeah, psychology at Sydney Uni. Are you? - No. - Where are you working at the moment? - Ah, I'm not, anymore. - That must be nice. - "Well, now it's just me and my pain. "For on my face is the bravest mask you'll ever see." Who's poems? - Oh, mine. - There's so many. - I steal a lot from other poets. I like to mix their stuff in with my stuff. Kind of like a poetry mash-up. I promise I'm not as much of a wanker as I seem. I'm just, I just do it to make up for the fact that I'm not musical at all. Drink? - No, thanks. Actually, maybe just a little one. - I'll get another bottle. Or not. Crap. - Who's that? - My parents. - You didn't strike me as the kind of person who lives with their parents. - I'm not, I just, until I finish studying, I'm not going anywhere. We might have to go somewhere else for that drink, though. - What, you're not allowed to drink? - I'm 24, they just don't like it when I steal their expensive wine. - Oh really, you do that a lot? - I try not to but it's so delicious. Anything? - No, just my mum again. - Maybe he's lost? - Maybe. Let's go get that drink. - Hello, there. - Guys, this is Leah. - Hello, Leah. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. - Ah, don't don't, don't touch them. They're for the ladies tomorrow at the book club. - Relax, Hazel, you don't even like the ladies of book club. - Sweetheart, what's happened to your arm? - Cat scratched me. - Again? God, she's a cranky old thing. - I haven't fed her today, by the way. - I don't blame you, I wouldn't either. She always goes after Caitlin. So you two girls going out? - Ah, yeah, just for a bit. - How's the essay going? - Good. I've done the structure. I know where's it gonna go. I just need to fill it all in. - Would you like me to have a look at it? - In the morning. - What do you do, Leah? - Nothing, apparently. - Actually, I was studying photography. - You were? - Yeah. - I didn't know that. - That sounds like fun. Maybe she can help you work the camera we gave you which you never use? - I could probably do that. - Maybe, okay. Bye. - Ah, excuse me, wait. Come back here. Mm-Wa, have fun sweetheart. - You want one, too? - I won't embarrass ya like your mother. - Thanks. See ya. - In the park in Sydney CBD for tonight's International Rally Against Climate Change. ♪ This is the call, call, call ♪ ♪ Let it be known, known, known ♪ ♪ That I say no way, today ♪ - What kind of photography did you used to do? - Different stuff, landscapes mostly. - Why'd you quit? - A few reasons. Mainly cause I needed money so I sold my camera. - That sucks. It must have been a good camera to be worth it. - Yeah, it really was. - Well, you can have mine. Apparently it's a good one. - You're pretty quick to give your stuff away. - It's just stuff. - No way, you're parents bought it for you. And they seem really-- - Old? They are. - And they're okay with the whole gay thing? - I'm pretty sure they don't even know. - Really? - I, I don't even try and hide it or anything. I just, I don't think it's the kind of thing that would ever cross their minds. - Oh, that's weird cause I kind of. - What? - Well, I don't know, your mum was so nice to me, I thought maybe she thought that I was your new girl. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Is that what you thought this was? Me hitting on you? - No, no, I mean, well not at first, but then I thought, maybe. - No. - What, what's so funny? - You. - Why, what's wrong with me? - Oh, don't get me wrong, you're very pretty. Just not my type. - Why not? - Uh, how can I put this? You're very straight. - That's a bit of a generalization. - But you are straight. - Yeah, well, it's, I don't really think it's very nice to label people. - So you're not straight? - No, I am, I just don't think that you should put people into categories. You gays hate when we do it to you. Why is it different when you do it to me? - Wow. Here I was thinking I had it tough being part of a minority when really you straight girls are the ones doing it tough. - It doesn't seem like a minority these days. It seems like everyone's gay. - Well, they're not. - I wish I was gay. It would be so much easier. - Oh, it is so much worse. So what about you? Family? - It's just me and mum. Speaking of which. - You can answer. - No, she'll just be wondering where I am. - So, she can't pick you up? - No, she can, it's just, she already hates Luke and if she knows that he hasn't picked me up she'll just hate him even more. - Well, don't you wanna let her know where you are? She's probably worried about you. - She'll be fine. - Are you sure you don't wanna try him again? - Yes. - So this is a little awkward, but I need to ask you something - What? - It's a little, heh, I don't even know how to ask. Um, fuck it. Do you know where I can get some H? - What? - Heroin. - Heroin? - Shh. - Do I know? - Yes. - No, yuck. Why would I know that? - Ah, your arm. - Oh, God, seriously? No, just. - Oh. - No. - Really, sorry. Shit, I'm, I'm not judging you, I promise. - I'm not a junkie. Are you a junkie? - No, I've just always wanted to try it and didn't wanna ask the wrong person. - Oh, well, I'm the wrong person. And why, that shit will ruin your life? - You seem pretty defensive for someone who doesn't use it. - I'm not a user. I just get a lot of blood tests. - Blood tests? Your arm looks like a pin cushion. No offense. - I think we've passed the point of offense, but yes, a lot of blood tests. - Why? - Because I have cancer. - Cancer? - Yes. - Real cancer? - No, fake cancer. - Well, what type? - Melanoma. - Oh-ho. Like skin cancer. - It actually sounds nice to have it belittled like that, but yes, it's skin cancer. - I'm sorry, I'm, I'm sure it's still bad. I just meant, it's not like a brain tumor. - No, I guess not. - So, how long does it take to get better? - Well, they gave me three months to live about one month ago so in two months I should be fine. - What? - Yeah. - You're dying? - Yes. - Of skin cancer? - Apparently. - You don't look you're dying. - That's because I'm not taking any treatment. The treatment's what makes you feel sick. - Why aren't you having any treatment? - Because by the time they found it, the only treatment options available where palliative. Screw that. - I'm sorry, a mole is killing you? - Well, it starts as a mole and then it spreads. - That's bullshit. - Huh, yeah. - What a shit way to die. - I'm pretty pissed about it, too. - Ah, you don't seem pissed, you seem totally fine. - Because I've had a lotta time to think about it. And also because, and I don't tell people this cause they think I'm crazy but I know they're wrong. I'm not dying. - Wait a minute. Is this like one of those doing it for attention things? Like, those girls who get pregnant and then just happen to have a miscarriage? - Fuck off. - Well then, how do you know you're not dying? - Well, you said it yourself. Look at me, I'm not sick. Doctors get these things wrong all the time which is why I'm not gonna go see them anymore. - I think you should still see your doctor. I mean, I'm not crazy about them either but they know their shit. - Do you know how many people have managed to heal themselves through natural medicine? It happens all the time. I'm seeing this lady here in Newtown and she's the best in the country. That's why I come so far to see her. She's got me doing this routine of Chinese herbs and acupuncture and meditation and stuff. She's amazing. - And she thinks she can cure you? - Well, it doesn't matter what she thinks. It matters what I believe. - Well, is it working? - Well, it's too early to tell yet. It takes about six months for it to show on the X-ray. - But you'll be dead by then. Mm? - Seriously? - Mm. Yes, of course, shit. Sorry, I'm just, I'm in shock. So do you have like a bucket list? - What? - You know, like, like a list of all the things you want to do before. - Uh, no. No, that was one of the things that the hospital shrink told me to do, but personally, I couldn't think of anything more depressing. - If I had three months to live, I would be out of here. - "Hey, I got caught up. "Do you think you could get your mum to pick you up?" - So this guy is your actual boyfriend of three years? And he knows all about this? - Yeah. - What a dick. - Hey. - You're going through this and he can't be stopped to pick you up? - It's not his fault. I mean, it would have been something real important. - Oh, sounds heaps important. And why didn't he send it earlier? - My phone doesn't get messages until late. - Alright. First you're dying because of a mole, then you're letting some witch doctor charge you God knows how much for medicine, which is probably just made of grass, and now you're making excuses for you dip shit boyfriend who can't be fucked to pick you up. - Why are you so upset about this? - Come on, finish your drink. - Why? - I don't care if you don't wanna do crazy shit before you die, I'm making you. - Can you sit down? People are looking at us. - No, you get up. - Why, what are we doing? - I don't know yet but it's gonna be fucking stupid. - Pff, not thanks. - Hey. Crikey. Stop. What are you doing? - Push me. - No. - Push me. - This isn't crazy. It's just annoying. - Do it. Woo. - Shit, run, run, run. - Whoa. - Girls. Bring the beer back. - Can I please have me phone back, Cailtin? This is ridiculous. - No, you can't, Leah. Dance, Leah. Woo. C'mon. Woo. Woo. - Just stop. That's enough, please. Just. - Ho, ho, okay, we can go. - Do they look like this? Cause my mum's always telling me to get that one checked. - I can't see anything but if your mum's worried about it, just get it looked at. Particularly because you're fair like me. - Now I'm really freaked out. What did yours look like? - A mole. - A mole like this? - You know, you're really lucky that you live so close to the Uni. - Yeah, that's where I do all of my last minute class work. - Well, you shouldn't leave it until the last minute. - Oh, I bet you are just the perfect student. - I was. - I also bet you were boring as batshit back then, too. - Hey. - Ah, uh-huh. Don't, I feel kind of ill. - Sorry. And in turn, Sydney Uni is a bucket list item because? - Oh, because it's so fucking prestigious and important, of course. - It is pretty beautiful. - Yeah, just ask it. So, is this what your Uni looked like? - Ah, no and it wasn't Uni it was TAFE. What made you wanna study psychology? - Oh, you know, save the kids, change the world. - Sounds inspiring. - Plus, my father was a psychologist. - Ah, yes. Daddy issues. - Not at all, you? - So many daddy issues. - Girls with daddy issues are hot. - Well, in that case. My dad left when I was five, and he didn't come to one of my birthday parties even though he promised. - That's nothing. I had to go into psychology just to get my father to talk to me. Even then I can't get him to look up from his newspaper. - Hey, can I have my phone back? - Don't call him. - No, I won't, I just wanna get a picture of the moon next to that building. - Are you done being a pretentious artist? - Yep. Wanna write a poem about it? How is this adventurous? - I told you, this is for me. I need you to impart some music knowledge on me before you leave this world. - Hmm. Oh. This guy's great. - Got it. - That's like five in a row, this is ridiculous. - I listen to a lot of music. One. - Oh, my dad used to listen to these guys before he left. No way will you know them. - Got it. - Se, seriously? That's bullshit. I don't believe you. - I do. Boom. Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da. Boom, ba-da-ba-da. - Okay, I can't believe you. - Cymbal, cymbal, bass, bass. - Okay, okay, I believe - Ting, ting. - you, shh. - So like, if Emma Stone came on to you, would you turn her down? - Oh, shit, where are we going? And of course not, I wouldn't. - No, you wouldn't. I'm hungry, that way. - What are you doing? - Yeah, this used to be a fountain. - Oh. - Get in. - N, No. - Why not? - Because there's no difference me standing here than there is me standing in there. - Yeah, I guess it was more fun when it had water in it. - Mm. - Mm. - Welcome back. - Mm. Yeah, sorry. I'm kind of sucking at this. - It's okay, I should probably try and find-- - Oh. - This is fucking stupid. - Told you. - I can't believe you're gonna go through with this. - Yep. Which one do you like? - I can't let you do this. - I've wanted to get another tat for ages. Just pick one. - But we've only just met each other. I mean, we might not ever see each other again. - Do you know how much random crap I have tattooed on me? I'm getting one for you. So, just pick the picture you want next to your name. - Huh, I can't believe you're getting my name tattooed on you. - If you don't pick one, I'm going to get a dolphin. Don't make me get a dolphin. - That one. It suits you. - It does suit me. Alright. Which one are you gonna get? - I'm not getting one. - Well, come on. - That wasn't part of the deal. - What, what deal? There's no deal, we're just doing shit, pick one. - It won't suit me. - Exactly. Think how shocked everyone will be. Think of how shocked your boyfriend will be. - Less. - Huh. - Stop. Relax. - How's it going in here? - I hate you. - Sit down and relax. Fuck, that's better. - What did you end up getting? - Ah, a quote from my favorite book. - Choose life? - It's from Trainspotting. - Yeah, I, I know what it's from, but you're seriously getting choose life? - Obviously I'm serious. What? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Okay, hey, keep still. - Oh, it should by like fuck life. - Can you just take a seat here, love? - Yeah, I'm sorry. - Good girl. Now you gotta keep still, love or otherwise it's gonna be a mess. - Oh, yeah. Oh, can you distract me?' - Um. Ah. Ah, who's your favorite character in Trainspotting? - Um. The one with the ah, the guy, the blond guy. - Which one? - The, the blond. - Have you even? - Okay, I've never read it. - I knew it. I knew it. - I watched half the movie once in high school because I had to. Oh, this is so stupid. - C'mon. Half an hour. - I think I need the biggest shot in the world. - Um, shots are shots, man. They're all like this big. - Caitlin. - Hey, Isabel. I, I didn't know you still came here. - Oh, yeah, we hardly ever do. Just sort of a random winner. I thought you might still come here. - Yeah, yeah, I'm, ah, pretty much still the same. - Hey, you've met Annie, right? - No, um, just heard of you. I'm, I'm Caitlin. - I know who you are, we've spoken on the phone before. - We have? - What, you mean you don't remember? Wow, you sounded so sober. - Oh, yeah, that sounds like me. - So what's new? - Sorry, um, this is Leah. - Hey, Leah. Hey. Wow, Leah indeed. Um, still impulsive, I see. - No, no, no, no, we aren't. We just met today. - Uh, this is so awkward. I think we should go. - Ah, yeah, sure, um. I think we're gonna go but there's a really great band coming up next. I think you'd really like them. - Must be good, then. - It was good to see you. - Yeah, it was really nice to put a face to the slurring. - You too. - Oh, that was tense. Was that your ex? - Caitlin, Caitlin. What's going on? - She's fucking nuts. - Caitie, hey. Just take some slow breaths, okay? - What are you doing? She'll probably hit you. - Shh, hey. - Ah, fuck. - Annie, Annie, don't. She's not well. - Hey. No more. Okay, no more calls, no more text messages at four in the morning about how you need help. I'm sorry you're a total mess but it's not her problem anymore. - Okay. - Fuck. Son of a bitch. - I know. She's right, though. This has to stop. It's getting ridiculous. And it's really not fair, okay? - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Are you sure, because that was really-- - Positive. Um, what were we doing again? Ah, going for a drink. - Right. Right. Let's do that. - For fucks sake. - What? - Hey, whatever happened to those little white tables they used to put in the middle of the PC? You know those little things? - Hey. - The student man, they didn't - And then-- have the students. - Little boys. - Please. Bit rude. - You're on my swing. - Well, way to ask nicely. - I just wanna sit on my fucking swing and drink my wine. - What happened to manors? - Come on guys. My friend's just had a rough night. Just let us sit on the swings. - Just go be a dicks somewhere else. - Whoa, I thought all the angry lesbians were at the rally tonight so it was safe to come out. - Hey, what's up with the sandals and the hoodie there? You get dressed in the dark? - Oh, yeah, there's that big, gay march thing on tonight. - Yeah, yeah, the big gay march, yeah. Why, Why aren't you there? - Maybe cause his wind dress is still at the wash. - It's a climate rally. - No, it's a climate rally. - Okay. - Same shit. - Huh, why because only gay people care? - Yeah, pretty much. - Pretty much. - Well, I'm not gay and I like the environment. I like trees and I like gay people and I'd go to a rally for either. - Why aren't you there then? - Because I didn't know that it was on. - I'm pretty sure you just told us it was on. - I mean, I forgot, okay? - Guys-- - No, it's just frustrates the shit out of me. I mean, why choose to be ignorant? Choose to be better. - Oh, I chose to be better. Boom. - There are facts, okay? There are scientific facts and if you just look at the facts, you'll see. - Oh. - Okay. - Alright, please, please, educate us. - Yeah, tell us some facts. Better start with fact one. - Yeah. - Maybe. - Go on. - Guys. - Go on. - Anytime, anytime. - In the last century, the average global temperature has risen at a rate 20 times faster than ever before. Water levels rising is a direct result of melting polar ice caps and glaciers caused by unprecedented amounts of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Your shaving cream contains CFCs which causes climate change. The sweatshop in Bangladesh which made those shoes causes climate change. Climate change is real. - And it causes skin cancer. - Look, I don't know about you guys, but I didn't sign up for this shit tonight. I'm outta here. - Yeah, have your swing, sweetheart. - I'm sorry. Fags. - Come on. - Come on. - Don't leave me with the crazy lesbians. - Yes. That was awesome. We got your swing. - I don't want it. - How good's this air smell? - Excellent when you're smashed. - I'm so drunk. I can't even remember the last time I was drunk. - I can't remember the last time I didn't drink. - That's because your life is fun. - That's one way of looking at. Calm down. - Can I have one? - No. You have cancer. - I got a fucking tattoo. - Yes, you did. - The last thing I thought when I woke up this morning was that I'd be sitting in a park, drinking with a total stranger with a tattoo. - Pretty crazy. - And that girl? You just walked up and smacked her. - It wasn't that simple. - This is fun. This is so much fun. - I'm glad you're having fun. - I'm glad my boyfriend is such a wanker, that he can't even pick me up from my cancer treatment. He's such a wanker. You're so right. - You know what dude? What do I know? It could have been something like really important. - It wasn't anything important. - Seriously, I'm usually wrong about this kind of stuff. - No, he's cheating on me. - You don't know that. - No, I do. I know her. - Seriously? - It's been going on for about a year and half now. - Does he know you know? - He still denies it. Even though everyone knows. Even though I've caught them multiple times. He still denies it til he's blue in the face. - Shit. - This is gonna sound really awful, but when I first found out I was sick, I was happy cause I thought at least now he'll give me some attention. Feel guilty enough that he'd have to stop seeing her. At least for the three months I had left to live. And he did for about a week. I mean, is it too much to think that maybe he'd be better? I mean, that maybe he'd wanna treat me a little better? Maybe take me away somewhere? Maybe call me back? Come to my appointments with me? Spend what little time we have left together? God, I even thought he might say, I wish I could trade places with you. But nothing's changed. - Well, you could change it. Why are you still with this guy? - Haven't you ever been in that kind of relationship? Where you love someone so much more than they love you? And even though you know you deserve better, you end up dropping your standards just to be more like them. And they just keep you at a distance, constantly. Giving you little bits here and there. Just keeping you desperate for more. And so when you find out that he's cheating on you, after the initial heartbreak, your biggest fear is that he's not gonna choose you. And so instead of confronting him and demanding that he stop seeing her, you just play dumb and turn a blind eye because at least then he'll be happy. I know it sounds pathetic. - It does sound pathetic. - I think I'm all crazied out, Caitlin. What are we doing here? - You ever played chicken before? - No. - You want to? - Definitely not. - That's a shame. - What, so you're just gonna stand in the middle of the road and wait until you see a car? - Well, no, I'm gonna have my eyes closed, so I'm actually not gonna see anything. - What is wrong with you? - Huh, it feels amazing. Like a rush you've never experienced. You can have a go after me. - Caitlin, please don't do this. - Now, no warnings, you'll ruin it. - Caitlin. - Shh. Do you hear that? Here we go. - Get out of the road, you stupid bitch, fuck. - You break the rules. - You weren't gonna move. - My hero. - Fuck you. - Leah, oh, c'mon. I'm sorry, but your life can't be that great if you spent the day with me and you're actually enjoying yourself. Life is shit, life is hard and it hurts. You've been given a gold ticket out. You'll probably be met in the afterlife with a parade and fucking baby animals with wings. My only way is to do it myself. And if I do, then I'm selfish and horrible and everyone will hate me, and I'll definitely be going to hell, which I'm not even sure I believe, but still that shit plays on your mind. - You did do that yourself? - Yesterday. - Yester, what the fuck? Why aren't you still in a psych ward? What about your parents? - Why would I tell them? - How do they not know? Oh my God, is this about that girl? - No. - Well then why the fuck would you wanna kill yourself? What is so bad about your life? - Nothing. Nothing is bad about my life. Nothing. Nothing happened to me, no one hurt me. I wasn't left, I wasn't raped as a kid. Fuck, I wish something had happened to me cause then at least I would know what is wrong with me. But there is a reason why when someone kills themselves that people say, hey, what a surprise, I never knew that was coming, and that's because it's not always that obvious. I was just born like this. Same way serial killers are born like that. - That's bullshit. You didn't wanna die otherwise you wouldn't have admitted yourself to hospital. You're just an attention seeker. - Fuck off. - And what about your poor parents? - What about yours? Your mum has two months left with her only daughter and you won't even call her back? Bet she would love to go to your appointments with you. Bet she would love to take you away somewhere, and I bet you she wishes she could trade places with you in a second. - Who are you? You're like this fucked up, alcoholic wise owl. - Alcoholics drink alone. I'm drinking with you. Just for tonight, anyway. - Just for tonight. - What are you doing? - Bucket list. - You know what? Let's not do this. I mean, thank you. I know that can't have been easy for you, I just. This whole side of things, it just ruins everything. - Sorry. - Don't be. I'm very flattered. - I wish I could say the same. - I mean it. This means more than that. - Mm, sounds like a blow off line. - It's not. - Whatever. - It's not. Seriously, after everything that's just happened, you're upset because I won't make out with you? Are you okay? - It's just a headache. - Yeah, I have one of those, too. - It's not the same. It'll pass. - Can I do anything? - Distract me. - It's kind of like a wheelchair. - No. - C'mon, I know somewhere we can go but we need transport. - Caitlin, I'm really tired. - Well, get in. - Aye? - Yeah. I'll push you there. - Well, I should think so. You did just reject me. - Ooh. Yay, let's go. - Wait. - You're taking photos again? - Dear Luke. - Oh. - You are the worst human being in the world. I have cancer, asshole. - Hmm, nice. - I'm done. - P.S. I just hooked up with a girl. - P.S.I just made out with a girl. - It was amazing. - I already sent it. - Like total, out of body experience. - Okay. - Walter Marsh, born 1823, died 1899. - He was really old. Lucky bastard. - Hmm, yeah. That's not gonna work. We need to find you some young stud. - This guy was in his 50's. Getting closer. - Eh. I may have found someone since now we know you're not opposed to a lesbian lover. She was 33. Ah, no, she had three kids. You don't wanna mess with that. - I think I found him. James Walsh, age 27. - Gone to soon. Your active bravery was not in vain. There you go. He was a hero. - Hm, that's the exact opposite of what I have now. - What do you think he did? Do you think he was like a soldier? - Wouldn't he be in an Army graveyard? - Oh, yeah. - I reckon he died from trying to save a kid from a rushing river and just as he pulled him out, he drowned. - Yeah. Like his foot got caught on an underwater tree branch or something, but he managed to push the kid out just in time. - I bet that's what happened. Well, he sounds perfect then. Hey, James, I look forward to meeting you. - Now, James, I haven't met you, but I have to give you this lecture. You treat her good man, alright? She's been hurt before and if you don't, bam, you'll meet my fist. - Shit. Shit. I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die, please. Please, I don't wanna go, I don't wanna die. Please, don't let me die. I don't wanna die. - You don't know. The, the treatment. - It's not gonna work. I know it's not gonna work. I'm so stupid. - You're not stupid. - I don't wanna die. Hi, Mum. No, no, no, I'm, I'm fine. I'm sorry. Yes, please. No, I just, I met a friend and I stayed over. - Enesco on the United Nations Heritage Body have issued a statement warning the Australian Government. - Hey. - Caitlin? - Yeah? - Are you gonna give me your essay? - Yeah, when I get back. - Psychology's a really hard career to get into Because you know too much. - I know, Dad. - Sometimes you can see the problems so clearly right in front of you, but you can't say anything because you haven't been asked. It's a helpless position to be in. So all you can do is to sit back, and hope desperately that they do ask. So let's make a deal. The next time the cat scratches you, please call so at least I can pick you up from the hospital. And I shall continue to sit here with my newspaper, in this spot, every day, until you ask. Deal? Leah, seems like a nice girl. - Yeah, she's cool. - Is she your new girlfriend? - What? Dad, no. - That's a shame. I thought you guys looked good together. - Thanks. - She's a pretty one. - Alright, good talk, Dad. - Your mum was a real looker at her age, too. Bye. - They'll break your heart. - Dear Caitlin, I just wanted to leave you a little note to say thanks for last night. It was one of the craziest, most random nights of my life. You definitely pulled me out of my comfort zone. I had fun. I had so much fun. Even if I currently have the world's worst hangover and my arms are gonna hurt for weeks from pushing you around in that damn wheelchair. It was still the best. I guess maybe I was wrong about bucket lists after all. So, thanks. Thanks for a big dose of reality. Now, I think it's your turn. You are insane. You're into weird things. You have a terrible relationship with alcohol and you need to stop smoking, you idiot. And you need to give your parents more credit. They love you, Caitlin. You're lucky. Shut up, I'm pouring my heart out here. I thought when I started writing this note that I was saying goodbye, but I realized you never know what tomorrow could bring. So no goodbyes. Not yet. And I guess if even Caitlin Davies visits the doctors, than I should probably go back to mine, too. Oh, and I took that poem. I really liked it. It was sweet but sad. Just like you. And that made me smile. Oh, okay, I'm gonna go now. Love, Leah. P.S. I still hate Newtown.
