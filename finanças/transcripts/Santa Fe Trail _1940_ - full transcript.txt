[instrumental music] [music continues] [instrumental music] Cadet troop forward! Ho! [instrumental music] Fours, right about! Ho! That is right. Fours, right about! Ho! Man 1: Form fours. Ho! Second section, the man on the right, number two, close in. Come on, pick it up, pick it up. At a gallop. Ho! To the right. Ho! [instrumental music] Man 2: Troop, dismount! Fall out! - Man 2: William Pender. - Here. - Man 2: Charles Sawtell. - Here. - Man 2: Jeb Stuart. - Yep. - Man 2: George Custer. - Yep. - Man 2: George Pickett. - Here. - Man 2: Robert Holliday. - Here. - Man 2: James Longstreet. - Yep. - Man 2: Carl Raider. - Yep. - Man 2: Phillip Sheridan. - Here. Man 2: John Hood. Hey, Jeb, take a look at this saddle sore. You think that's serious enough to report? I don't know, George, but I've certainly got to report mine. - Ooh. - You boys can have the cavalry. Me, I'm gonna apply for the infantry. Tired of playing housemaid to a temperamental mare. That's the first good news your horse has ever heard. Go on, Gertrude, kiss him. [horse neighs] - Stand still you devil! - Steady, boy. If you weren't so hot-headed you wouldn't hurt your mouth. I told you before we started you had that curb chain on too tight. It's not the first time you've cut his tongue. Ever tried putting a curb on your tongue? No, nobody else every tried it. [chuckles] I suppose it takes one of you southerners to handle a horse. Well, at least, we know how to harness them. You know how to harness Negroes down south too I hear. With a strap across their back. Come on. When are you going to take a punch at him? Unh-unh. Too close to graduation. Besides if I waited four years I guess I can wait another week. [trumpet music] "The breaking up of the American Union as of now exists is the basis of my plan.” "And that destruction must be made upon the issue of Negro slavery and on no other." "The union must then be reorganized on the great principle of emancipation.” "This object is vast in its compass." "Terrifying in its prospects but sublime and beautiful in its issue.” "A life devoted to it would be nobly spent or sacrificed." "If the federal government in its constitution "are opposed to my way of thinking, the fault is not mine, but theirs." "And I shall continue to oppose them with every means and every weapon at my disposal.” Who wrote that inflammatory rot? A wise man by the name of John Brown. Mm, where did you get it? That's my business, if you don't like it you don't have to listen to it. You meant it for me, didn't you? - Take it anyway you like. - Sure, he meant it for you. He tried that abolitionists stuff on me until he found out I came from Kansas. Never mind, Bob. Come on, Jeb, let's turn in. There is no regulation against a cadet having his own ideas. But there is one spreading treasonable policies. You find the truth hard to take, hmm? Listen, Rader, I know the truth of this problem far better than you do. The south will settle it in its own time and in its own way. But not through the propaganda of renegades like this John Brown or any of his followers. You mean that renegade line to include me? Look up your oath of allegiance and answer that for yourself. I'll answer that right here and now. I've taken a lot of you southern snobs. For 50 years now you have been watering your precious family trees with the sweat of Negro slaves. Piling up wealth and snobbery until now you think you own the government and the army. And anybody who disagrees with you is a lying renegade. A rebel rousing traitor. Well, you get this from me, Stuart. And all you other Mason Dixon plutocrats. The time is coming when the rest of us are going to wipe you and your kind off the face of the earth. [intense music] - Jeb, don't be a fool. - Stop! Let them fight it out. Man 3: Hold it, Rader. - Jeb. - Jeb! [glass shatters] Attention! For sometime I've been aware that the disturbing force has been active among the regiment of cadets. The exact nature of this subversive campaign and the persons responsible for it have not been fully known to us until this moment. Stuart, by every rule of the academy you should be discharged from the service. And your associates are no less guilty for their part in this outrageous affair. Colonel Lee, any blame in this matter is entirely upon me. It's my sole responsibility, sir. That's not quite true, sir. It was my fault. We are all equally responsible, sir. Man 4: That's right, sir. Man 5: That's right, sir. If I believe that you were guilty alone, Stuart I should have sent for you alone. As for you, Custer, and the rest of you you must be taught that lying to protect a friend is sometimes an extremely dangerous practice. I'm not so greatly concerned about the fight itself as I am about its cause. All seven of you men violated the first sin of military conduct. The traffic and violent exchange of political ideas. Which are not the affairs of an American solider. You must be punished and punished severely. I shall request of the war department upon your graduation next week that all of you be assigned to the most dangerous branch of the United States Army. The second United States Cavalry. Now stationed at Fort Leavenworth in the Kansas territory. [clears throat] That's all, gentlemen, you are dismissed. Now send for Cadet Rader. How can you read that? Fort Leavenworth, suicide station. Kansas in the Santa Fe Trail, what a piece of luck! That's it, and the cavalry, active duty, promotion. Why, we'll all be generals, while the rest are still chafing.. Oh, that's death of the country, Jeb. Nothing grows in Kansas but trouble. What are you talking about? I grew up out there, didn't I? Well, I suppose he's not. Yeah, wait till I get you boys out there man alive, that's my stamping grounds. [indistinct chatter] These pamphlets were found in your quarters. Dozens of them, together with a letter written by a member of the abolitionists party instructing you to distribute them among those cadets who appear to be sympathetic to their cause. How long has this undercover activity of yours been going on? Long enough. Very clear idea of your fellow conspirators to plant an agent in our midst. Your dishonorable discharge will be drawn up at once. And you will be given until sundown to remove yourself and your personal belongings from the limits of Westpoint. Good. And you can tell Mr. Stuart for me that he'd be smart to stay in the army. Right in the middle of it from now on. Cadet William Cue, Ohio. [applauding] Man 5: Cadet Martin Evans, Ohio. Cadet Arma Mallow, New Jersey. [applauding] Cadet George Custer, Ohio. [applauding] Cadet James Longstreet, South Carolina. [applauding] Man 5: Cadet Philip Sheridan, New York. [applauding] Cadet J-E-B Stuart, Virginia. [applauding] Cadet John Hood, Kentucky. [applauding] Cadet Robert Holliday, Kansas Territory. Yippee! Cadet Jason Wood, Virginia. [applauding] Cadet George Pickett, Virginia. That's my sister Kit. Thought two years in Boston would make a lady out of you. So did I, it just popped out. Man 5: Cadet William Keel, Ohio. [applauding] Man 5: Cadet Robert Davis, New Jersey. [applauding] It is now my great honor and privilege to introduce the secretary of war of the United States of America. The Honorable Jefferson Davis. [applauding] Officers and gentlemen of the class of 1854 their welcomed guests and their very proud families, I'll not keep you separated very long as I myself once sat in your place and endure an interminable address by a very tiresome general. [laughing] But as a secretary of war of this nation I have a serious obligation towards each new officer of the army before he enters into active service. And that obligation is to make clear and definite his responsibility to his government. We are a new nation among the powers of the world. Just 80 years ago we were fighting desperately for our freedom. And we are still fighting to keep it. We are not yet a wealthy nation, except in spirit. And that unity of spirit is our greatest strength. You men now have but one duty. One alone. America. With your unswerving loyalty and the grace of God our nation shall have no fears for the future. And your lives will have been spent in the noblest of all causes, the defense of the rights of man. [applauding] [instrumental music] [indistinct singing] [singing continues] [train horn blaring] Tickets! [indistinct chatter] Tickets. Tickets. Mr. Holliday, we're getting close to Leavenworth. Yeah, it's a shame this tea kettle of yours doesn't go any further. What for? There's nothing to go to. There's half a nation out there, cap. Someday I'll build a real railroad to open it up. Clear the Santa Fe. For a man who made a fortune out of horses you sure got a heap to learn. Hey, cap, tell the boys to speed it up, will you? The last time I had get out and help chop wood for the engine. Well, the first time you rode with me I had to change your diapers. [laughing] Hey, cap, where am I going? Looks like you are going to Hades. Just wanted to know. Bob's been telling us about that railroad Santa Fe so long. Now, Mr. Holiday, I'm surprised to learn it hasn't even been built. Well, let's not all foster it. You can't build a railroad over blood-soaked ground like Kansas. Decent sellers won't use it. We are losing thousands of pioneer to Oregon Trail. They circle right around us. We heard about the raided arsenal last week. What is the true situation out here, sir? Well, Kansas is a territory and not a state. We are ready to join the Union, but the big question is whether we'll go in as a slave state or as a free state. On one side is most of Kansas' pro-slavers people who came from south. On the other side are the abolitionists lead by John Brown and the sons. Between those two elements they've made Kansas a boiling pot of rebellion and massacres. That's why the army sent you boys out here to Fort Leavenworth. Suicide station, it's quite an honor. - Excuse me, will you, sir? - Surely. You know, the first time I saw you at the graduation I thought of what Napoleon said when he first met Josephine. What was that? He said, "I never knew this savage land they call America could breath such perfect beauty in mortal form." Oh. Thank you. - That's a lovely line. - Yeah, isn't it? George has been using it for years, haven't you, George? I... I wish I could think of nice things like that to say. You wouldn't like what I'm thinking now. You were going to tell me something more about Kansas. Yes, what do you do on Saturday nights for fun here? Well, as I remember, half of Leavenworth takes a bath another the half gets drunk. And since there are only two bathtubs in town they seem a kind of exciting around midnight. Kit! Kit! Kit. By the way, how they ever came to name you Kit Carson Holliday? Well, Mr. Carson and my dad were very good friends. And they were so sure I was going to be a boy they named me before I was born. Oh, I see. Well, I'm certainly glad they were wrong. - Me too. - Me too. Me too! - Hey, conductor. - Yeah? What're you going to do about that? - About what? - I'll tend to that. Hey, I thought I told you them Negroes had to ride in the last coach. Their tickets gives them the right to ride wherever they please. Now, I don't want any trouble with you, mister. Then you better leave us alone. Well, I don't know what this country is coming to. - Tickets! - Stop shaking, Anna. There's nothing to worry about. We're only half an hour from the border. If we don't hurry, they will be across the border. Alright, go ahead. [instrumental music] Where you taking the Negroes? What business is that of yours? We are asking the questions. Are they free or bond? Here are the papers. You can see it for yourself. Yeah, that might mean something if we didn't know who you are. Now don't you make a move. We're taking you and them off of this train while they're still in Missouri. Now, come on, get up all of you. [instrumental music] Where're they gonna take us, Master Brown? What they gonna do with us? [gunshot] Stop him. What do you know about this? There is the trouble, Negro slaves. He was trying to sneak 'em across the state line. I'll get that murdering jayhawker for this if I'll have to hang for it. - Who was it? - Oliver Brown. One of John Brown's scurvy litter. Better than a doornail. Come on, you'll get by greenhorn give me a hand. There ain't no use spoiling the carpet. Come on, get him out of the way. Now, don't get excited, everybody. Sit down, please. This is what they mean when call it bloody Kansas. There'll never be any peace along the Santa Fe Trail while John Brown or any of his followers are alive. [instrumental music] Cyrus: Now this is the present terminal. I proposed to come down here to Wichita. And along here across the Arkansas River along the Cimarron River, over here to Las Vegas. Here on into Santa Fe. Now that'll be our first section of track. From Leavenworth to Wichita. Right over the trail. How soon do you figure to start? Well, the men back east say they are ready to put up the money as soon as we can prove that a rail route through Kansas are safe and will pay. - Dad! - Yes, Kit. Where did you put the loading list? List? Gosh, I clearly forgot to make one out. That's great! Ninety eight tons of freight ready to roll and no orders for loading, how'd you run this business while I was away? That's why I sent you away to show you what a skirt was. Look at your clothes, look at the grease your nose. What would your friends in Boston think of you now? Frankly, dad, I don't much care. If you are going to keep your nose in the paper railway I better keep mine in the family affairs. Tex! Windy! Tex! Where are those ornery cousins? What do they think they're getting paid for? Tex! Why didn't you tell me? Getting jealous, huh? I didn't even see Lilly when I said goodbye to her. Oh, now don't start lying to me, you double crossing buzzard. I know that you didn't buy that there looking glass to see your own ugly mug. I suppose you're figuring on wearing that female cinching belt. Wait till Lilly sees what you brung her. She'll brain you. If it ain't physically impossible. - Why you ignorant... - Kit: Tex. Hey, you two. Where in the name... Will you come here? - Hello, Ms. Kit. - Hello nothing. Are you gentlemen of leisure by any chance interested in employment? Oh, we lost our watch. Yeah, we didn't have no idea of time. I ought to give you both your time and throw you out. Where in thunder have you been? Well, you see, we had to buy these nick-nacks. Well, we sort of got a gal in Santa Fe, Lilly, uh... Hofstadter. And what do you mean we? - I'm engaged to her. - Well, who ain't? You set up housekeeping at Santa Fe or is this just gilding the lily? Oh, she want us to fetch her one of them fancy French looking glasses. Ain't it pretty? What's your answer to that, Tex? [laughing] What are you all laughing at, you long eared jackasses? Go on, get to work, both of you. Go on, jump to it. You better hide that thing or start wearing it. [instrumental music] I'm going to put you new officers straight from the start. This is Fort Leavenworth and not Westpoint. You were sent here to man the frontier garrison. Three of the officers you're supposed to be replacing are buried back of the hill in the little military cemetery. The other four haven't been found yet. The regiment of mounted rifles has only one job to keep the peace in Kansas. And we're here alone. There's no other fort between us and Santa Fe. And we're proud of that responsibility. We've got a tough reputation in the army but they respect us in the west. See that it stays that way. Order of the day, Lieutenants Longstreet and Holliday take B troop and put them through close order drill. Lieutenants Stuart and Custer will take eight men as an escort for the freight caravan leaving at noon for New Mexico. Draw the usual supplies and report to me for final orders. Say, will you keep all those cases of Bibles near the tail board. They're only going a short haul. We sure will. Let's go. [instrumental music] Convoy ready, sir, we're ready if you are. Good, I hope you have a nice, quiet trip. On any other kind, I lose money. Oh, we will try and save you that. We'll see you in six weeks, sir, with luck. Just keep your eyes open, boys, and move fast. You'll like the scenery but don't trust it. Alright. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye, Stuart. Goodbye, Custer. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] Corporal, detail two men to cover each wagon. Yes, sir. Phil, move all these barrels over there for the next ride. - Well. - Hey. Looks like we both got the same idea. Looks that way. How're we gonna work it? Here. I've got an idea. - Let's draw for it. - Fair enough. Right. - I got the long one. - Hey, wait a minute. Where I come from long man loses. Tough luck, old man. Here, hold my horse. One hand plough, one seater, seven eggs, 15, 12 and 14 and... Why, Joe, there is something missing. Must be me. Hello. Hello. What are you doing here? Oh, playing nursemaid for those wagons. Should be the other way around. Oh, the convoy. That's a silly idea. Dad, he thinks that man John Brown is behind every bush. Well, it's not that I mind so much it's being away from you for six weeks just when we're getting started. Started? When? Now, look, I've only got a few minutes left. So I've got to be fast. You haven't been exactly slow for a couple of days. I've never seen such a pair of whirlwinds as you and George Custer. George, poor old George. Well, never mind about him. Look, Kit, I might as well tell you before I go. I'm completely crazy about you. - What? - No, wait a minute. Let me finish. I needn't warn you about army life. The pay is bad, I'd never be home. You'd probably be a widow in two weeks. I see, have you thought of any particular names for the children? No, be serious, will you? This might be the most precious moment in our lives. I hope not, not in these clothes. Haven't you got any heart at all? Yes, I have, and it's going to stay right where it is. I don't know a thing about you, Jeb Stuart. My brother thinks you're wonderful. But then he was dropped on his head when he was a baby. Well, at least you'll let me kiss you goodbye, won't you? Oh, well, it's quite an honor, but no, thanks. I... I don't really deserve it. Well, hello. Say, this is quite a surprise. The corporal's looking for you, says it's very urgent. Mm-hmm, I'll bet. Kit, we will take this up later right where we left off. Now, George, don't be long winded. Listen, Kit, we're due to leave in a minute now. There's something I've got to tell you. I'm head over heels in love with you. George, you sound just like an echo. Oh, Kit. Ah, pardon the interruption, George old man. Kit, there is something I forgot to ask you. Have I got any real competition? How do you think any girl would answer a question like this? - Well, just tell me the truth. - Then you'd both be crazy. Get going, you bull whackers! Through desert heat and dust your throats will soon be choking. S Your head's about to bust. No water when you're thirsty. And all you get to eat. Is aromatic antelope and some big buffalo meat Yippy-aye. Good luck, boys. We may not even live to get our pay. But even if we don't get paid. There ain't no job we trade. For hauling freight from state to state. Along the Santa Fe. For hauling freight from state to state. Along the Santa Fe Yippy-aye. Aye-yay. There's trouble riding with us all the way. You'll think over what I said, Kit? Every word. Take care of yourself, George. Don't worry about that. Goodbye, darling. Along the Santa Fe Yippy-aye. Aye-yay. There's trouble riding with us all the way. Although we sweat and whine and cuss. The only job for us. Is hauling freight from state to state... - Wanna make a little bet, Kit? - Sure, on what? Those two boys. I'll give you a three to one I can name the winner. That's ridiculous. [laughing] Which one do you want? [indistinct] - I'll take that bet. - Good! Is hauling freight from state to state. Along the Santa Fe [instrumental music] And to instruct to all volunteers not to enter Kansas unequipped. Nor to display their weapons to public view. Let that be understood beforehand. - Warn them also... - Not so fast, father. Warn them also that our plans must be known to ourselves alone. That they join me in the clear knowledge that all traitors of the cause must die wherever caught and proven to be guilty. Tell them that we stand by one another while a drop of blood remains. That under no threats or pressure do we make confessions. Alright, that's our camp. I might as well tell you when you get this far you don't turn back. You don't have to worry about us. We ain't the kind that quit. That's fine. Just see you keep it that way. Save all of us a lot of unpleasantness. You've been delayed. Was there trouble, Rader? No, sir, we had to detour when we got to the border. I picked these new men up in Palmyra. Volunteers, sir. Here are their credentials. From Illinois. You've come a long way. And we'll go the rest of it. We came here to fight slavers. - The sooner the better. - That's good. We'll put you to work at once. Kitzmiller, look after these gentlemen. Kitzmiller: Fine. This way, boys. [indistinct chatter] We've received the news we've been waiting for. - We break camp, Rader. - Yes, sir! Let's start tearing down these tents now. [instrumental music] Oliver! He's hurt. - I'm alright. Where's father? - Father! What has happened to you? Where are the Negroes you were told to bring? A couple of pro-slavers tried to grab us on the train. I shot one of 'em and jumped off. You left four helpless people alone to save yourself? I had to do it, father. It was me or them. You cowardly fool! In future obey my instructions. We leave at once. [instrumental music] All of you, down upon your knees. As once you sent the ravens to save Elijah so how you have delivered into my hands the precious means of continuing Thy holy work. The Lord our God is a great God a mighty and a terrible who regardth not persons nor taketh reward. The Lord is a man of war. Thy right hand shall become glorious through power. Thy right hand, oh, God shall dash in pieces the enemy. [instrumental music] Hey, Oscar. When we cross the river you watch out for that wagon. It's got my looking glass. Hey, Tex. These horses are pretty tired. When are we going to make camp? Oh, as soon as we cross the river and then we'll be out of danger from both sides. You know, lieutenant, I'm sure glad we're leaving civilization. It's getting too dangerous for a peace-loving man. I run into some of them abolitionists this once. But who's this fella John Brown they talk so much about? Oh, as far as I know he's just a dirty old windbag. - In fact, he's just your type. - Either of you ever meet him? Tex: No, but two of them fellas he killed at Osawatomie were friends of mine. You mean Jim Doyle and Allan Wilkerson? Yeah, and that's the reason I'd sure like to meet up with this here Mr. John Brown. He's got no quarrel with people like you, Tex. You would do much better to leave him alone. Well, you can count me in anyhow. Even if he ain't harm no friends of mine I sure would hate to miss a good fight. [instrumental music] This is wrong, father. We've never attacked a wagon train before. We aren't common highwaymen. You say we have a righteous cause but this will bring the law down on us like a storm. We recognize no law but the law of God. You will do as I command. Take your men back, Rader. Wait for my signal. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] Howdy, strangers. Good morning. Are these Holliday's wagons? - That's right, sir. - My name is Smith. Jonathan Smith of Newton. Ah, well, what can we do for you? I believe you're carrying some freight consigned to me. Oh, we might be, if you got something to show for it. I have this receipt from the shipper. Come a long way with an empty wagon, haven't you, Mr. Smith? Newton's about a 100 miles from here. My home is in Newton, sir, but my place of business is much closer to the trail. Oh, I see. I thought your horses look pretty fresh. Eight cases of Bibles. That's right. Come on, Windy, we will unpack these Bibles for the parson. Jason, bring up your wagon. Get that cart down. I got to get them Bibles unpacked for the parson. That's a funny thing. I've seen that fella somewhere. It's the way it seems to me. It isn't the kind of a face you'd forget in a hurry. Yeah. Wait a minute. I know. In some magazine, "The Atlantic” I think. Well, and he's either from Boston or he's a missionary. No, it was something else. Been a lot of bad trouble over across the river lately, Mr. Smith. That murdering skunk John Brown is on the loose again. Better keep your eye peeled for him. Thank you. We shall. This stuff sure is heavy for Bibles. How would you know? You ain't never even saw one. Ah.. [instrumental music] Just a minute. I'd like to see those Bibles. Stay where you are. Put your hands up and keep 'em up. [instrumental music] [gunshot] I advise you to make no move towards your gun. Bring up the other wagon. Now then, quickly with those other crates. Alright, get a move on there. Only the ones marked Bibles. Hey, Jeb. Look. Our friend Rader. Well, this is a surprise. The commission and the cavalry too, huh? I see you've got the commission you were after. You know these men, Rader? Yes, sir. Very well. This one, Stuart, comes from a rich slave owning family in Virginia. He called you a lying renegade once and I jumped him for it. John Brown. Him? - John Brown! - John Brown? I've nothing personal against you men but I will deal harshly with any interference. I might have known that you'd wind up with this outfit. Well, that's one of the troubles with the army, Stuart, they don't teach you to think ahead. They do one smart thing. They teach never to turn your back on an enemy without first making sure he's harm... Stop this. We've not saddled ourselves with the killing just to satisfy your personal quarrels. One more murder won't mark you any deeper than you are now, Mr. Brown. I intend to be a marked man. Back to your horse, Rader. Back to your horses, all of you. I've given you fair warning. You can keep your heads or lose them as you wish. Move on. [instrumental music] I saw what was in those cases, George. - What? - Contraband. - Riffles and ammunition. - Gosh! Then we've been delivering Bibles with triggers on 'em. Let's take a chance. Everybody take cover and open fire. Dismount! Take cover! [gunshots] Stop! Cover the wagons and move back. We mustn't lose anymore men. [gunshots] Get back. He's running. They're getting away. No, they are not. We're going after them. Hey, wait a minute. They outnumber us three to one. Well, if it makes you nervous, don't count them. Come on. Everybody, mount and follow me. Everybody, mount! Come on. I tell you, here's where I get your medal. Forward! [instrumental music] Get those wagons out of here! Come on! Quickly! Use your whip, Jason! Use your whip! [gunshots] [instrumental music] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshots] [gunshots] [instrumental music] [gunshots] [music continues] I couldn't help it. I didn't do anything. Alright, son, nobody's going to hurt you. - Who are you? - Jason Brown. Brown? You're one of John Brown's sons. Yeah. Yes, but I never did anything. He made me go along. I never killed anyone. I swear it. I'm getting out. I'm quitting. You've got to take me with you. Alright. Bring a horse up, George. - Bring up the horses. - We'll have to carry him back. The boy is badly hurt. It's his father's madness really striking home now. Jeb, there's a purpose behind that madness. One that can't easily be dismissed. George, you've seen the needle on a compass, haven't you? It's got a whole car to swing around in but it always wobbles back to the North. What are you driving at? Just this. I've always known where your sympathies lay, but it never affected our friendship and it never will. But it isn't our job to decide who's right and who's wrong about slavery anymore than it is John Brown's. I guess you're right, Jeb. I'm sorry. [instrumental music] That's the most doggone fun I've had since we got hemmed up with them Injuns. Yeah, well, the next time we shooting at a commoner you let me do the shooting. Boy, my gullet is dry as a powder horn. [glass shattering] Get up. You busted Lilly's looking glass. When she looks at herself in that she'll think she's a hundred years old. Or more. Of course, we're aware that firearms are contraband in Kansas. Do you think we'd have accepted those boxes as freight if we'd known what they actually contained? Well, I'm just asking, that's all. Doesn't it seem strange to you that Dr. J. Boyce Russell, the most prominent religious leader in America should be sending rifles marked as Bibles to John Brown? How can I control the marking of crates? We once received three tons of gunpowder marked bird seed. Well, then you'll have to examine every crate you haul. What? For all we know this contraband may have been slipping through for months. Jason. Listen, son. You've got nothing to be afraid of if you'll be honest with us. Now, I want you to answer my question truthfully. Did your father ever mentioned this shipment of rifles when he discussed his plans? Not to me. He never confided in me. Just Fred and Oliver. - Fred and Oliver? - My brothers. - Where are their headquarters? - I don't know where they went. They have a dozen places, I... I don't know. I don't know. Alright, kid. Don't worry about it. [instrumental music] Man 6: These guns are no mistake. Anyone with their best interest of Kansas at heart can tell you that. Cyrus: No bendy-legged bushwhacking soldier can talk like that about the Holidays. We've got as much interest in Kansas as the United States government. And a darn sight more investment. We were here before the army came in and by God we will be here when you're gone. If you think you can... Sir. Well, Stuart, what did you find? Very little, sir. The boy is either too badly hurt or too frightened to talk. We leave immediately. Have them sound to assembly. Yes, sir. What was that you called me? A gold darn bendy-legged bushwhacker. Now, go on. He says he talks with God at night. But God doesn't tell people to kill one another, does He, miss? He's a, he's a good man in a lot of ways. But he's changed since Osawatomie. Those people he killed... They got down on their knees and begged him for their lives. But he struck them with a sword. Him and Rader and Kitzmiller. I was there. I saw it done. I tried to stop them but they pushed me aside. Yes, that's how it was. We're starting at once. I'll take the first troop west to Tecumseh. Stuart, you and Custer will take the first platoon of B troop and search thoroughly from Clinton to Dutch Henry's crossing. Is that clear? - Yes, sir. - These are your orders. Find John Brown and bring him back here. Alive if possible. His force is well-armed now and strong in numbers. We also suspect that new volunteers are drifting in from the East to join him. Be on the lookout for them as well. Retire to your respective troops. [trumpet music] What's that? They've caught some more of us. No one's been caught, Jason. Not even you. You've committed no crime to be afraid of. I'm sick of being afraid. I'm sick of hiding like a hunted thing. I want to walk free like other people. You will, Jason. - You are safe now. - No, I'm not. Not as long as he keeps killing and thinking that he's right. He can't be right, can he, miss? I don't know. His reasons may be right, Jason. They may even be great and good reasons. But what your father is doing is wrong, terribly wrong. And he will keep on repeating that wrong as long as he lives. Then, then I'll never be free of him until one of us is dead. I know that now. My life don't mean anything. But if he dies maybe this whole scheme of his will die with him. I'd rather have it that way. His life... Even if he is my father against many thousands. I'm going to tell you where to find him. Well, Jason, I'm not trying to... I'm going to tell you anyway. In the house of Shubel Morgan, Palmyra. That's where they went. That's their headquarters. Tell the soldiers! It's better that way. His life against many thousands. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] Jeb. Hello, darling. How is he? It's very serious. I left the doctor with him. - Poor little devil. - Jeb, he told me everything. The whole nightmare of his 15 years even the place where his father is now. He said he wanted me to tell the soldiers. - Where? - Palmyra. At the house of a man named Shubel Morgan. Shubel Morgan, Palmyra. - I wonder if that's the truth. - Jeb. I'm frightened. That boy is crippled for life. And that man on the train, he died for principle. And a man killed him for a principle. One of them is wrong. But which one? Who knows the answer to that, Kit. Everybody in America is trying to decide it. Yes, by words in the East and by guns in the West. But one day the words will turn into guns. Oh, Jeb, can't it be stopped now? Can't the slaves be free before it's too late? It will be stopped when we hang John Brown. Then the South can settle our own problem without loss of pride at being forced into it by a bunch of fanatics. Oh, Jeb, what has pride got to do with human lives? Kit, the two things kind of come together down South. We can't pry them apart. Not even with guns. I hope that's going to be the same way with us. Uh-oh, that's me all over. Clumsy Cluster. Or can I get into this too? - Yes. - Sure, sure. It's like you're not. Don't miss much, do you? Ah, I've seen your work before, son. That's where I learned. That's credit one more to my account, Kit. I would like to let the interest accumulate. - Well, goodbye. - Goodbye, George. Hear that? - Don't be long, Jeb. - Oh, no, no, no. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Kit, remember this, will you? I love you. Put that in your little bonnet and keep it there until I come back. - I'll remember. - Goodbye. Tex: Hey, lieutenant. - Hello, boys. - Hello, Lieutenant Jeb. Say, I want you to keep an eye on Kit for me while we're gone, will you? No. We're going to hunting John Brown with you. - What? - Yeah, we've come to join up. Who do we see? A couple of flat-footed rumpots like you in the army? Why, you would get lost. Boys, you better go home and sleep it off. So long. [trumpet music] [instrumental music] Jeb. Jeb! Jeb! He's dead. If you find John Brown, tell him. We'll try to find him. Goodbye. [instrumental music] Kit, once when you were about this high Tex and Windy brought home a wolf cub with a broken back. You nursed it for weeks but it finally died with his head in your lap. You cried for days. But it was just a wolf cub. It would probably have grown up to be a killer like its father. [instrumental music] What does being flat-footed got to do with riding a horse? Calling me a rumpot is what hurt me. I ain't had a drink since noon. [instrumental music] Alright, get the sledge. [instrumental music] It sure is expensive salt pork, Mr. Morgan sir. Not the way we get 'em. Round 'em over and stack 'em in the barn. Yes, sir. This looks like the best shipment we've had yet. Wonder what Rader's worked up about? Him and the old man been arguing for an hour. Looks like another job for us if Rader thought of it. West born education is a wonderful thing. Yeah, if you can collect on it. Yeah. I signed up because you promised to pay me. Train this rabble gang of yours into a solid fast moving unit of fighters. Taught 'em how to use these new rifles, how to follow orders and take a town in army fashion. But I haven't received a red cent in three months. Now, what about it? Mr. Rader, I enlisted you on the recommendation of friends in the East, who said you would work for the cause. You've done the job well. I've no complaint up to now. But our plans are ahead of any personal greed. If you feel otherwise, you are free to get out. But you must decide here and now. I want only loyal men around me. You've no argument with my loyalty. I proved that in Osawatomie and every other town we've raided. But you hired me as a military expert at a set price and I'm only asking what's rightly due me. And I say that you'll receive it in time. Only let me think in peace. My son is a prisoner in the hands of our enemies. Even now he may have a rope around his neck. An innocent boy who never fired a gun in anger in his life. While I stand here powerless to save him. Alright, I'll wait. Well, what's our next move? The Bible has said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." Tomorrow at daybreak we will destroy Delaware crossing. [instrumental music] Jeb! Lieutenant Jeb! Troop, halt. Well, what the... Well, the major sort of turned us down too. But here we are, Lieutenant Jeb. What do you mean trailing us halfway across Kansas? We don't want you to get lost. You see, I know every wrinkle of this here country just like my own face. Well, you're sure that's just as dirty? I've got a good mind to get a couple of mules and strap you on the back and send you home. A fine looking pair of soldiers you make. Well, we needed some of them pants and a cap. And then of course there's some soldiers just our size gets killed, why... Alright, get back to the end of the column. Go on before I get that mule. We don't have to obey no orders. Since we ain't in the army. - But we will. - Yeah. [laughs] [yowling] Wait till Kit hear about this. She'll skin 'em alive. That's if they've got any skin left. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] Who did this? John Brown. How many men did he have with him? Around a hundred. Maybe more. - How long since he left? - Three, four hours. We lost count of time. Oh, you're the man that had the run in with one of the Browns on the train. - Is this in revenge for that? - Yes. We're Free Staters here. Brown always knew we'd get him some day if he didn't get us first. Well, I'll leave you some men to help you bury your dead. Let's see you back to Leavenworth. We don't want any help. This is our fight. We don't want you or nobody else to finish it. I'm going to take care of John Brown myself. Get on your way, soldier. We've got work to do. I know how you men must feel about this. But my orders are to break up all armed forces. Yours, John Brown's, or anyone else's. I'm sorry, but if you organize under arms I won't be able to draw a line between you. That suits us. If it's got to be. [horses trotting] [choir singing indistinctly] What did you find out, Kitzmiller? A tube of cavalry from Fort Leavenworth are headed this way. Ignorant fools! Shubel, we're moving camp. Round up all your men. Get the wagons ready to roll. Just food and ammunition. We're traveling light and moving fast. What about the Negroes? We can't take all of them. We're not taking any of 'em. [singing indistinctly continues] [singing fades] My children, the hour of deliverance I promised you has come. I'm leaving Kansas now to continue God's holy work. [murmur] "So Gideon took ten men of his servants "and did as God had said unto him. "And it was so he did it by night "and when the men of the wicked city arose early in the morning behold, the altar of Baal was cast down." Please, Captain Brown. What do that mean? - What you gonna do with us? - It means that you are free. The first of many millions to whom I shall give freedom from slavery. Does, does just saying so make us free? How we gonna live? Get food and shelter? There are many good people in Kansas who will give you work and protection. From now on, you must fend for yourselves as other free men do. My work here is done. - Praise the lord! - Glory bliss! God, we's free. The captain done tip his word, we's free! We's free! We's free! [indistinct singing] You know, if John Brown is a 100 men we better send a runner back, bring up the rest of the troop. Better do it tonight. I'm going into Palmyra, George. You, alone? Don't be crazy, Jeb. That town's full of jayhawkers, they'd shoot you on sight. Well, I'll have to take a chance on that. I'm gonna get some other clothes, take a couple of men and go in and do some scouting. I'll try to send you back word. Good luck. Jeb: Say, do you two fellows still want to join the army? - Huh?! - I've got a job for you. It's no picnic, it's pretty dangerous. But I think you're the fellows for it. What do you say? Do you mean we're gonna have a real cap and a uniform? Mm-hm. Well, we might have to be buried in 'em. But it sure sounds like a deal. [dramatic music] The law has got nothing to do with it. We came here to join John Brown because he's a leader, and a fighter! The whole thing's going to be settled right here in Kansas. We came here to fight slavers, didn't we? The only way to fight 'em is with guns! Sure give a good lookin' over in this here's man town. Yeah, I feel just like I was takin' a bath in a bath tub without no sides on it. The only kind of a tub you ever was in. Say, who could I talk to in this kind of a town without arising suspicion? - The town barber. - That's right. Anytime a barber can't talk to a stranger he's liable to go crazy. The town barber. Hm. That's it. [instrumental music] - Howdy, boys. - Howdy. Pretty good looking horse for this part of the world. Yeah. Kansas is alright for men and dogs but it's pretty hard on women and horses. [chuckling] Say, look at that brand. That's an army horse. Maybe just bought him from someone. No, they don't sell 'em. Nobody rides that brand but a soldier. You keep your eye on him till I get back. You still got that creepy feeling about this place? I don't know whether it's that or here chiggers. But something's creeping over me. Why don't you scratch and see if it goes away. Yeah, I reckon that is all it was. Say, I got it now. We was on the same train a couple of months ago when that fellow got killed. Uh-huh. You probably got me mixed up with somebody else. No siree. I never forget a face. Although, I was little drunk at the time. Well, there you are. The fellow you saw probably had two faces. - Been in Palmyra long? - Oh, just a couple of weeks. This ain't no town for barbers. The fellows that ain't trying to hide their faces for some reason or other are too mean to spend the money. Yes, I've heard you got some pretty tough customers here. Tough? Say! I'm afraid to shave half of them. Afraid they'll get up and cut my throat. [chuckles] Say, do you ever run across this famous... - What's his name, John Brown? - Sure, he came in here once. Strange looking man, with a hit mark on his throat. Jeb: Hit mark? What's that? Oh, it's an old barber superstition. A little red line that runs all the way around here. Anybody born with that mark is bound to be hung. That so? Say, I haven't got one, have I? Not yet. Maybe. Well, well. Keep your hand away. Get it. This was quite an idea, Stuart. You coming in alone first to look around. Is this one of your agents? I ain't never laid eyes on him before. I swear it. I-I don't know him from Adam. What were you up to? Well, it's your move. You figure it out. My next move is plain enough. Didn't they teach us how to handle spies when we caught 'em red-handed? Same treatment for renegades, wasn't it? When you catch 'em. This will make you quite a hero, Stuart. The class of '54 will turn out in a body for your funeral. They may even hang your picture in the West Point Library. There's worst places to hang. Get him out of here, Rader. We're wasting time. Just having a last few words with an old classmate of mine. And I had them coming to me. Come on, get up. We're gonna give you a good look at what you came to see. We can't afford to take chances, sir. He was sent here as a spy. It's my advice to get rid of him. - Let's string him up. - Goddamn right. What did you hope to achieve by coming alone to Palmyra? The army has orders from Washington to bring you to trial. I hoped that if I came face to face with you first a lot of unnecessary bloodshed might be avoided for your men and mine. Were you innocent enough to think that I would surrender myself to you without a fight? I hope that you might consider yourself innocent enough to do that. Half of the people in America believe in your theory. A lot of them even condone your methods. That'll guarantee you a public trial. Fool. I'm not on trial, but the nation itself. Are you too stupid and blinded by a uniform to see what I see? A dark and evil curse laying all over this land. A carnal sin against God. It can only be wiped out in blood. But why in blood? The people of the Virginia have considered a resolution to abolish slavery for a long time. They sense that it's a moral wrong. And the rest of the South will follow Virginia's example. - All I ask is time. - Time? [yells] Time? For 30 years, I waited for the South to cleanse it's soul of this crime. Since childhood I've been possessed with the fire of correcting this wrong. I tried peaceful agitation. As God as my witness, I tried. Peaceful means failed long ago. Now I shall force a decision by bringing both side into armed conflict. Letters, words, talk, the time has ended for that. Strength and action are wanted now. Not a voice crying in the wilderness but a David armed with the power and the glory. - David had a son, hadn't he? - A son? Yes, Absalom, who deserted his father and went over to the enemy. What're you trying to tell me, Stuart? And Absalom died because he feared his father. Jason is dead! So be it. My son has paid for the sins of this world with his life as once did the son of God. It shall not be in vain. Whether you kill me or not my army will crush you all in the end. My advice to you is to find peace with your maker. Man 7: Now the big one. Sit down. I never liked barber's know-how. Now spill out, you little, pitirim weasel. I'll cut your throat! Where'd he go? I swear, I don't know, boys, uh, well, th... th... they've took him out that way. - Who took him? - T... three fellas. One of them was Oliver Brown. Do you see this razor? Well, I'm keepin' it. If you moved a hair when we get back, I'm gonna strop it on your liver and barbecue your carcass. Now you stay where you are. [dramatic music] [door closes] Back East for me! I called you all together as witnesses to hear my words. An enemy to the cause has entered our midst stealthily, and by night. With the purpose of planning our destruction. The hand that has never failed us has come once again to our protection. It's not with malice or revenge that we take this man's life but in just retribution. As befits all enemies of mankind. All enemies of God. Man 8: Ready, sir. [gunshots] [firing continues] [dramatic music] Get back! Get back! Move away from that door. Cover those windows! Surround the barn! [firing continues] [glass shattering] [firing continues] [music continues] [glass shattering] [glass shattering] [music continues] Get to the back door! [firing continues] Hold on there, captain! Get down from there if you don't wanna get killed. We's coming, boss. That white man talk like he's a friend. [glass shattering] [firing continues] [music continues] [fire crackling] Lord all mercy, boss! Looky here! Get the bags, quick. [music continues] [crashing] Alright, get away from the barn, men. - Move on! Hurry it up! - Let him burn! Move on the wagons! Go! Get away from the barn. Get those wagons rolling. [indistinct chatter] Take cover! Behind the wagons! [guns firing] It's Oliver! First Jason, now him. - You wanna fight on, John? - As long as breath is in me! Surround the church! [bugle charge music] [dramatic music] [firing continues] [crashing] [music continues] [firing continues] - You alright, sir? - Jeb! After them, George. Don't let them get away. Load up! [dramatic music] [Mammy sighs] Ouch! That's too tight, Mammy. Don't tell me how to do this, boy. I've been wrapping white folks all my life. When they was babies I wrapped one end and when they'd growed up and took on too much corn liquor then I wrapped the other end. Huh. Is that what made you leave home? Well, old John Brown said he is gonna give us freedom but shook-in's, if this here Kansas is freedom then I ain't got no use for it. - No, sir. - Me neither. I just wants to get back home to Texas and sit till kingdom come. Dismount and fall out. Well, we had a nice ride. - Both ways. - Lost him, huh? He and a few others got away in the hills. I think I hit one, Jeb. You oughta heard him holler. Heard him holler? You jug head, that was me. - You shot my hat off. - Well, it won't matter much. He's broken for good. From now on, he'll find every man's hand against him. Nothing will ever break the force of John Brown, Jeb. - Not even death. - Oh, you are wrong, George. He's finished. His force is broken forever. Why has thou afflicted thy servant, oh, lord? Were for do I not find favor with thee? Why has thou laid the weight of all his people upon me? Yes. This is a sign for which I have waited, oh, lord. This is your command. The burning bush! Let there be no peace in all this land until we have revenged ourselves upon thine enemies. As once you smote the Philistines smite now the fury of thy wrath upon these blind misbegotten fools. I shall be thy right hand. I, John Brown, shall be the sword of Jehovah. [instrumental music] Take a good look, gentlemen. The beginning of the railroad to Santa Fe. These rails are gonna stretch their way right across old trail right over Kansas down into the territory of New Mexico. Someday we can tell our grandchildren that we opened the doors of America to the great Southwest. - Won't we, Kit? - You just build your railroad. I'm not guaranteeing anything. Yep! The end of John Brown was our beginning. Maybe it'll cost a lot more blood and grief but it's gonna be worth it. Dad, can I ring the bell on the first train? Yep, and blow the whistle. That'll be a day you can live for, Kit. Oh, won't it? [music continues] Come fill your glasses fellows. And stand up in a row. To singing sentimentally. We're going for to go. In the army there's sobriety. Promotion's very slow. So we'll sing our reminiscences. Of Benny Havens' oh. Old Benny Havens' oh. Old Benny Havens' oh. We'll sing our reminiscences. Of Benny Havens' oh [applauding] [instrumental music] Congratulations, boys. - Thanks, sir. - That was excellent. I didn't recognize the song. Where does it come from? It's an old army song, a farewell. These young men have all been promoted and are ordered back to Washington. - That's splendid. - You, lucky devils! I had to wait ten years for my captaincy. And I also followed tradition by proposing to my wife the same night. Would you like some refreshments? - Yes, I would. - Splendid idea. Well, I think I'll run down to the stable. Horse threw a shoe this morning. Ah. See you later. I'll go with you, maybe I can find it. Why did you have to go and lie for tellin' the major we is the best barbeque along the Santa Fe trail? Oh, I just mentioned it sort of casual. How'd I know he was gonna take us up on it? Wait till he starts eating this. [scoffs] He won't take us up, he'd take us up and out. Do you think it's gonna be hard chewing, Tex? Well, I don't know, I still got a hunch we should've skinned it first. We took the horns off of it, didn't we? What is a captain's pay, Jeb, $38? - Uh-uh, $40. - Forty a month. [whistling] Say, that's enough to get.. - Go on, get what? - Well, you know, this and that. What're you planning to do with your extra pay? Exactly the same thing as you are, son. - Want to draw straws? - Not this time. This means too much. Well, how're we gonna handle it then? Take turns? I don't trust you Southern boys in the moon light. Alright, let's ask her together. - Hey! - Wait a minute. - What is this? You lunatics! - Come on. Don't argue.. Just come along and listen. There you are. George has got something to ask you, Kit. You have the floor, George. Well, I don't know just how to start, Kit. But there's an old Indian woman who hangs around the fort and tells people's fortunes. She is supposed to be a wonder at it and.. - Well.. - Yes, George? Well, she said I'm going to get married soon to a very beautiful girl. Did she, George? That's very nice. Pretty slick opening remark. Kit, were you ever by any chance a blonde? - Why? No. Not even as a baby. - Are you sure? This old woman has never been wrong before. - Absolutely sure. - Well, maybe she's still right. There's a whole lot of beautiful blondes in the world, George. Let's ask her. - Let's. - Wait a minute. Kit, are you in love with him and not with me? I guess I am, George. - You're gonna marry him? - Oh, wait a minute. I can handle this proposal from now, son. Kit, you really mean that? You haven't asked me anything yet. I wonder if I said the wrong thing. Mm-mm-mm, couldn't have been more perfect. Now where's that Indian? [instrumental music] [chanting in foreign language] What she saying, Kit? You know the lingo. She says that this is one of the last times we'll all of us be together as friends. [all laughing] Now ask her something sensible. Who is gonna be the first general? [speaking foreign language] She says that one day you'll all be famous men. Great in battle. But bitter enemies. Pickett, Hood, Custer, Sheridan, Longstreet and me enemies? Now I know she's crazy. Where did you ever pickup this old figure, George? I can tell better fortunes than that with tea leaves. Well, we might as well get our money's worth. Ask what we're gonna fight about. Yeah, who is gonna start it? [speaking foreign language] Well, what's this? Too ridiculous to tell? She says, the fight has already started. Somewhere in the east, a man is lighting a torch. Now, at this very moment. The two of us will help to kill him. But none of us can stop him. [laughing] Here is where I would attack first. The arsenal at Harpers Ferry. Give me only a 100 good men, Dr. Russell. Well armed and God-fearing men who believe in the cause. I will lead them through Virginia. Arouse the thousands of discontented slaves who will flock to join us. Then sweep down through the south. Through the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi then with the entire nation in the state of chaos we can dictate our own terms. Have you considered the army, Captain Brown? Surely, they'll be after you in full force within a few hours after you first attack. Let them come, Dr. Russell. Let them try to stop me. I've studied that country for years. It's full of good hiding places natural forts where large forces of brave men can defy pursuit indefinitely. Mr. Rader will go ahead of us and scout the town. With his knowledge of military methods and our great advantage of surprise we can outwit the army at every turn. Captain Brown, this plan of yours is mad. Worse than mad, it's high treason. Such a brazen attack would lead to civil war. Exactly! That is exactly what I want. Is it your wish then to destroy the union? My answer to that is yes. To the devil with the union. We've got to fight sometime, it might as well be now. [murmuring] Gentlemen, I came here to Boston at great personal risk. There's a price on my head of $10,000. So, my time is precious. You've given me much help and encouragement up to now. But all that we've done in Kansas and elsewhere will be all wasted unless you see it through to the glorious end. How much money will you need? [dramatic music] We now possess the guns, ammunition pikes, a complete store of supplies. To place in the RSF, Harpers Ferry day break, Monday, October the 16th. We must strike with two forces, suddenly with complete surprise and then move rapidly through Virginia. You men all know what will be demanded of you. - Yes, we are waiting, captain. - Captain. It's Rader. He made good time. Well, what did you find? Speak up. Is anything wrong at Harpers Ferry. Well, the town itself won't any trouble. There's a bridge at the Baltimore and Ohio railroad to be blocked and we got to cut that telegraph line to Washington. What about the government arsenal? It's guarded by only two men. Here, I made this rough map of the place. Good. Excellent. This is precisely what I wanted. We must first take some hostages from the town that'll prevent an attack by the civilians. Then we'll move directly on the arsenal. - There's something else. - What? I want to settle our account. Back in Kansas you promised to pay me what's due when you got the money. How dare you demand a settlement of a private matter? With the nation hour of deliverance not three days off. That's putting the cart before the horse, isn't it? I've done a job for you nobody else can do. So, I was right at Palmyra the cause itself means nothing to you. I'm only holding you to your word. Are you, indeed, have you forgotten so quickly my measures with disloyalty? I haven't forgotten anything. But you got the money to pay me and you can't afford not to. Then add this to your memory. I haven't waited 30 years to bargain with a rouge at the final hour. [instrumental music] Hiya. This is the kind of army life I like. - Do you ever see me waltz? - I've heard of it. But this ain't no Santa Fe shake down. Hold it. You're in high society now, come on. [clears throat] May I have your invitations please, gentlemen? - What's them? - Thems 'em little white cards. We ain't go no invitations, Joe. Can't we get in on our uniforms? No, sir. Not unless you wants to go right out on 'em again. Oh, we're the fellows who cleaned up Kansas. - Ain't you ever heard of us. - Sorry, sir. But we don't need no cleaning. Good evening. [instrumental music] Hello, handsome. - Oh, hi, Jeb. - My! You're a dream tonight. - How's the party? - I don't know. She hasn't come out yet. - Who you waiting for? - Old friend of mine. Promised me a surprise tonight. A night I'd remember the rest of my life. Yeah? You don't know any girl here but Kit, you know? I-I'm not talking. Maybe you don't rate quite as high as you think you do. Captain Stuart. [door opens] Hello, Kit. - You look wonderful. - Thank you. Say, George was just telling me you've promised him the biggest night of his life. - Where do I come in? - You don't. - I'm very fond of George. - Thank you, Kit. I haven't told you this, but we have a deep understanding. Wait a minute, Kit. Are you serious? What is this? I'm gonna take care of George for the rest of his life. That is if he's the man I think he is. Oh, Kit, I have my faults. But I can be as faithful and loyal as any man that ever lived. We'll soon see. Now wait here, both of you. Tough luck, son, I guess we can't all have charm and good looks too. Custer, I hope you are joking or you're not gonna have either. Oh, don't take it so hard, I mean, this is something that... Hup. [giggling] Charlotte, I want you to meet. Captain Custer and Captain Stuart. This is Charlotte Davis. We were schoolmates together in Boston. - It's a pleasure, Ms. Davis. - Charlotte: Thank you, captain. Yes, indeed. A great pleasure. I've heard so much about you, Captain Custer. - Me? - Charlotte: Mm-hm. Well, I, uh... Well, that is, uh, I mean... George: Well, uh... well, that is... I... - Shall we dance, Jeb? - Yes, of course. - Who is she? - That's the blonde. The one that George was promised by old "sit in the mud." Oh! I see. [instrumental music] Well, she's pretty nice. Don't you think? Left wheel. Company, halt! Present arms, prepare to scoop. [clears throat] - Uh, sir. - Yes, sir. [clears throat] About face! Company, forward march! Eyes right! Right wheel. Well, there I was right out in the middle of Kansas facing 500 crazy fanatics heavily armed. And me with only 15 soldiers. Good heavens, captain. How terrifying. What did you do? I sized up the situation at a glance dismounted and walked straight toward them. Not... not alone. My dear, young lady, there comes a time in every soldier's life when he must stand or fall alone. And if you knew the army you'd understand that he who hesitates is lost. Well, that was something wonderful, captain. Oh, it was nothing. Really. [music continues] [applauding] Will you come and meet my father, captain? Why, I'd be delighted. Is he in the government service? Yes, but I think he'll lose his job in the next election. Oh, that's too bad. Say, he should be in the army. You know, politics don't bother us. He'd rather go fishing anyway. - Father. - Hello, Charlotte. - Hello, Colonel Lee. - My dear. Father, I'd like you to meet Captain George Custer. Oh, but of course I met the captain at West Point when he graduated, didn't I? - Yes, sir. - How're you, Custer? I'm fine, Colonel Lee. We've heard good things about you, congratulations. Yes, the captain's just been telling me how he put down the trouble in Kansas by himself. Splendid job at Palmyra. Splendid. Wasn't there also a chap named Stuart, uh... Jeb Stuart connected with that campaign? Stuart? Yes, sir. He was around. Shall we dance? [instrumental music] Left turn. About face. March! - Jeb. - Go away. You danced with your sister once already. I don't want her, I want you, come on. Hey, you can't leave me stranded alone in the middle of ball room. Quiet, spread. Phil, Phil. Take over this detail, will you? - Are you drunk? - If I'm not, I ought to be. I've just seen enough to knock anybody down. What're you talking about? An old friend of yours is outside. And he asked me to bring you to him. [music continues] It's real. I almost touched it. What're you doing here? I came to find you. I know what you think of me, Stuart. That I'm no good. Well, maybe you're right. Well, maybe I've got something to tell you that'll change your opinion. You'll have a hard time doing that. Suppose I told you that I left John Brown three hours ago with a well armed force of men not very many miles from where we're standing. I'd say you are out of your mind. All set to strike at Harpers Ferry on the Maryland-Virginia line sometime tonight. With the reinforcements of over 1200 men expected before daybreak from Pennsylvania. Brown plans to arouse the slaves first in Virginia and then throughout the south in open rebellion. The telegraph wires will be cut and he'll block the railroad and then at daybreak they rush the arsenal take thousands of weapons with the idea of arming the Negroes. Well, that's the situation, gentlemen. Move for move. I don't know, you may be able to get there ahead of 'em but if you do, you've got to move fast tonight. It's fantastic, our Secret Service has reported John Brown to be out of the country. Well, I oughta know where he is? I've been with him every day and every mile since we left Kansas. Then why have you informed on him. Don't forget, colonel, I was in the service once. I was young, and I made a mistake. I didn't know that then but I do now. I guess some of the things we learned at West Point stay on inside of us a lot deeper than we realize. Anyway, I couldn't stand by and see my country torn apart by a mad man like Brown. I had to come here. This was something a lot bigger than myself. Couldn't have been the size of the reward you'll get for turning him in, could it? I said why I came here, and that's the truth. But I am entitled any reward. I'm even willing to go back there and rejoin him tonight just in case he gets suspicious or changes his plans. Now what more proof do you want than that? I believe him because it's too dangerous not to. How soon can you start, colonel? We'll be ready to leave in an hour. The officers are all here. Call them at once and proceed with all speed to Harpers Ferry. [indistinct chatter] You have your orders, Captain Stuart? Yes, sir. Jeb, what is it? - What's happening? - John Brown. Get the little Davis girl to take you home. - Will you, darling? - But why, but... I'm sorry. I can't explain now, no time. Try to keep the others calm, tell 'em, there's nothing to be excited about. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. [dramatic music] Good. There's no more worry on that score. You say no train is due until well after daybreak. No, sir, not until 8 o'clock. I rode within ten miles of Washington to make sure. What kept you so long? I had to take a side road both ways. [scoffs] Shubel, Townsley. Get your men block the railroad bridge. We meet below the arsenal at daybreak. Kitzmiller, go to the town with 20 men and get the hostages. John: You know the ones? Kitzmiller: Yes sir. John: Rest you men, follow me. [dramatic music] Drop your guns. Captain, we got enough guns here to arm a 1000 men. And plenty of powder and bullets. Stack those guns and ammunition near the door ready to haul. Hurry up, boys, get 'em out there. Men from Pennsylvania will be here within the hour. This isn't an arsenal, it's a fortress. We could stand off the whole army here. What about the prisoners, captain? What is the meaning of this outrage? Why have you broken into our homes and dragged us here? - Who are you? John Brown! - I am John Brown of Kansas. You are prisoners of the provisional government of the United States. If the citizens of Harpers Ferry attempt any interference, I shall use you as I see fit. Otherwise, you will be peacefully released when we depart. We must adhere to our schedule to the precise minute. We will leave here at 10 o'clock and by nightfall we should be 35 miles into Virginia. What about the men from Pennsylvania, sir? If they're late in arriving, we cannot wait. Wouldn't that be taking a long chance? No word of us can leak out until tomorrow maybe even two or three days, and then we'd be 1,500 men. I don't see that there's any reason to hurry. - That sound sensible. - I disagree. I'm anxious to get out of here and time is our most valuable weapon. Well, you're in command, sir. But that's been the fatal mistake to many an expedition. My advice is to wait. [gunshots] Some of the townspeople are firing at us? Just a handful of "em with old shotguns. We can clean them out in five minutes. [firing continues] Idiots! Why do they fight us? Can't they understand? [firing continues] - What is your name? - Brewer. If you value your life and those of your fellow townsman you will do as I say. Yes. Stop firing. You're endangering the your lives of your friends. John Brown promises that if we leave the arsenal in his hands he will harm none of us. No! Run down to us! We'll cover you. Quick. [gun fires] Stupid cattle! Can't they understand we're here on a righteous cause. Their interests are also ours. The good of the whole nation. We'll leave out lesson at Harpers Ferry for the rest of the South to profit by. Wipe out those fools at the foot of the hill. [guns firing] [dramatic music] Cease firing! We're moving into the hills. Take all the weapons and ammunition you can carry with speed. It's well past noon. We can wait no longer for the Pennsylvanians. [telegraph clicking] "Eighteen citizens of Harpers Ferry killed, thirty-three wounded by John Brown's invaders in open rebellion.” It's from the second force at Frederick, Maryland. "The road to Harpers Ferry is blocked. Unable to get through.” "Jefferson guards and the Winchesters under Lee's command passed through Upperville an hour ago. They will be the first to arrive at the ferry." [dramatic music] - What're you watching, Rader? - The North Road, sir... The North Road is over there. This is the Washington Turnpike. Well, I thought our men might circle the town... That was not their orders. Help with the wagons. Yes, sir. Well, don't you think we ought to wait another half hour? It might be... Every man inside! Bolt the doors! - Bolt those door! - Man the loophole! [dramatic music] [rattling] [instrumental music] Wait, you said. "There is no cause to hurry. Wait." Yes, sure I did. I thought we had time. - Stuart. - Yes, sir. I want you to take this under a white flag to John Brown. Right, sir. There's to be no parlaying. Yes or no? If it's a refusal, wave your hat to us. Right, sir. Hang on to this, will you? Captain Brown, they're coming up the road with a flag of truce. [music continues] Open the door. - You're John Brown of Kansas? - I am. We've met before I think? And thanks to Mr. Rader, we how meet again. This is Colonel Lee's formal demand for your surrender. Once more, sir, you over rate your strength and supposing that I can be taken against my will. - That's your final answer? - It is. We prefer to die here. Try to surround them! Take troop B to the right of the gallop, troop A at the left of the gallop. Troop C, draw your guns, dismount! - Take cover! - Forward and a gallop! Ho! [bugle charge music] [gunshot] [firing continues] Bring the right flank into position. [firing continues] [bugle charge music] [music continues] [crashing] Attack with C troop on the left flank. C troop, at first! [firing continues] [crashing] [cannons firing] Prepare a battering ram. [crashing] Keep firing! Forward. Forward! Forward! [bugle charge music] [crashing] [music continues] All of you keep on firing! [music continues] No. So Judas betrayed him for a handful of silver. Don't! [gunshot] [crashing] [dramatic music] Cease firing. [bugle music] [instrumental music] Man 9: Over, hut! [instrumental music] Now, Kit. He was born for this. I'm not crying for him, Jeb. I see something else up there. Something much more terrible than just one man. Have you any last words, John Brown? I am only walking as God foreordained I should walk. All of my actions, even the follies leading to this disaster were decreed to happen long ages before this world began. But I cannot remember a night so dark has to have hindered the coming day, or a storm so furious has to prevent the return of warm sunshine in the country of peace. I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land can never be purged away but with blood. I let them hang me. I forgive them and may God forgive them for they know not what they do. So perish all such enemies of the union. All such foes of the human race. [instrumental music] Man 10: "For this company, and thereto have given and pledged their truth each to the other. And have declared the same by giving and receiving a ring and by joining hands. I pronounce that they are man and wife united forever with ties that no man shall breaketh under, nor the years disturbed whose shining path shall run together from this day hence unto eternity."” [instrumental music] [music continues]
