Jake! -Hey, Jake! -Dude! -Hey! -You came, huh? -How are you? -I'm doing OK. She's there. Give it to her. -Come on. -Come on! -There they are! -Baby girl! -Where's the birthday girl? -Uncle Jake! Look! He's got a gift. I have a gift for you. -Do you want a girl or a boy? -I hope it's a girl. Hey, you should make one, too. Yeah, sure! OK. You're such a clingy husband. All right, guys. Now that Jake's here with us, can we plan my stag party? I want it to be the best one ever. Can you leave me out of it? You know that I behave myself now. -Then who'll do it? -Here. You have Jake. -Me again? -It's your area of expertise, right? Right. You're the expert, Jake. Of all of us, you're the only single one. But that's the thing. -Wait. Listen to me. -That's right. You're the only one. I have an announcement to make. What is it? -Dudes! Later tonight... -What? I will finally propose. Propose? -Are you serious? -Dude, if this will mean I'm really sure of it. Wait, dude. I'm just concerned. What about Nikki? What about Mitch? What about Vanessa? What about... -Lea! -Tina! -Who's Tina? -There's too many, right? -What? -Too many for you to remember! Tracy! There's only Tracy! I only love Tracy! -She's the only one that I want. -OK, congrats! -Thank you. -We'll have a stag party. But, dude, seriously? Can we see it? -How large is the diamond? -Later, OK? You guys are so excited. Just chill. Although, it may seem too cute. Just like Erika! Right, boss? The one who is petite but sexy? Or, just like Angelica, Bianca, Tifanny, Marie... Your type. It's too angular. It looks hard. Just like you. Like when Tracy cries because of you. What's with you? You're a blabbermouth. Can you just cooperate? So, you really want to have a lot of choices. -Just like-- -Just like true love! It's too cheesy! Miss, here's the thing. She's endured a lot because of me. But she never gave up on me. It signifies true love. Pure... and infinite. Freshen up, please! Guys, let's hang out after work. Where are we going this time? Oh, I can't tonight. Not tonight. Something special will happen between us tonight. I NEED TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING I SHOULD'VE GIVEN YOU LONG AGO. This is it! He said he's going to give me something he should've given me a long time ago. I'm sure it will be a ring. Esang, I'm getting a ring. -He's going to propose tonight. -Hey, you. I should call you cough syrup, because you put the expect in expectorant. He'll just give you a list of debts that he wants you to pay. No, he's going to propose to me, Esang. I just know it. Please fix my things, Esang. -There. -Here it is. What are you saying? Shut up. Come on, you guys. I have no money. I'm kidding. OK, this round is on me. Go to Aling Itang and ask for two bottles, my treat. Only two bottles, OK? This is the first time you've treated us since we were kids. Are you dying? I'm getting married. Hey, let's eat. Hey! Look out for my mother and our house, OK? Don't worry about it. Hey, pretty! You're getting married? Can I be your flower girl? What are you talking about? -You'll be the ring bearer, hello. -Who are you to call me that? I'm on my way. Me too. But I'm going to be a bit late. You know, traffic and all. But, no matter what, I'll wait for you. Take care, babe. I love you. Babe, can I hear an "I love you, too"? Look where you're going! What a moron! Do you have a reservation? Valdez? Ma'am, there is no Valdez on the list? Maybe I got here first. But, table for two? Wait. Have a seat. What's the occasion? Do I need an occasion So much. Have a seat first. What? What? Why now? Because you're finally ready now? Bong. Bong. Where's Jeric? Tintin, Jeric couldn't come. He asked me to give this to you. He says he is thankful for the movies that you let him copy. And he's sorry he wasn't able to return this sooner. I'll go now, then. ESANG: CHECK JERIC'S FB! NOW! Sir, one more shot. OK. Hey, it's Tin. Hey, Tin. Look at him. -Why is she crying? -Sit down. What's wrong? Answer it. It's me again, Tintin. -Hey, it's Tintin. -I'm sorry, girl. -Hey! What took you so long? -Coming! -You're too early for tomorrow. -Wait a minute. Where have you been? We'll look bad in front of our clients. Sorry. I'm really sorry. Just get the makeup ready. We'll deduct 150 bucks from your talent fee. That's too much. -She won't get paid. -That's unreasonable. Oh, wow. So, you're still famous. Haven't you deleted your videos yet? I have. But, of course, a lot of people had already downloaded them. Well, as they say, it's harder to delete the feelings -than the viral videos. -Oh, come on. Work. -Hey! -What? -There. -Look at that, girl. -Jake? -What's the event? A campaign photo shoot. By the way, Carlo is here. How are you, bro? I'm good. It's nice here. What are you two doing here? Why? Can't I check on my baby brother? Come on. I'm just a text away. Jake, it's been six months. You're not doing anything. Your staff need you. Right, Telay? Right. Yes, sir. I'm already having a hard time. Please come back. Telay, you guys can handle it. I don't get it. You're locking yourself in this resort just because you were hurt? We, the del Mundos, make girls cry. Isn't that what Dad taught us? It's not our fault we're so good-looking. Tracy got so hurt... she doesn't want to get back together. Then forget about Tracy. C'mon! Telay, just a minute. Bro, I'm serious? OK? I'm not kidding. I'm worried about you. Don't do this to yourself. I'll think about it. But wait. Are you really over him? I am. You swear? I'm over him. Really? Wow. No reaction. Good job. OK. If you've already moved on... Prove it. Can you hit on somebody here? Anybody here, OK? Yes. Can you do it? Sure. I'm game. Too easy. Over there. That cutie-pie looks hot in his tank top, and he has lots of tattoos. Waiter! Can I order a big platter of rice to go with that hot body? Oh, gosh. That's too much. So, what now? What? Too easy. Oh, me neither. I don't smoke. It's bad for you. Waiter? Allow me. -Jun. -Sir? -Bring the entire bottle here. -OK, sir. Wow. You must be a regular. Actually, I own this resort. OK. Do you have a girlfriend? Wow. You're fast. No beating around the bush. Why do that? I used to have one. Ex-girlfriend, now. Aren't you going to ask me that too? Do you have a girlfriend? Of course I don't have a girlfriend. I also don't have a boyfriend. Why? What happened? -Do you really want to know? -Sure. Watch this. because it makes our makeup last longer. Because you know, nothing lasts forever. Don't let your face dry up like the love lives of most of us. In drought. Ouch. It hurts. Don't fall for their tricks. Don't let yourselves become victims. You made me fall for you, you flirt. Am I not pretty? You think you're really handsome? Oh, shit. He really is handsome... Right. That's why you look so familiar. What happened to you here? Let's not talk about it. You showed it to me. Sis, we're going back to our room. We seem so out of place here. You're the only one having fun. So, you're doing OK now? Oh wait! Ms. Andre, Esang... What's your name again? There. He's Jake. He owns the resort. Oh, him? -You're joining them? -What about it? -You can't join them. -Why? -You don't belong here. We're leaving. -I really can't? Don't come home late, OK? You have to cook breakfast. Your friends are funny. Really funny. OK. I became an English-speaking try-hard. I even prepared pick-up lines for you. My friends told me to hit on you. If only I'd known we were on the same wavelength. So, what now? Come on. Let's just play a game. Do you know the game... -How do you play? -We'll ask each other questions. And if you've ever done it, you drink a shot. Make sense? -All right. -Get it? OK, OK. I'm game. Let's do it. No. How about you? I really thought you would drink it. There it is. You're too much, mister. You're one-of-a-kind. -Really. That's too much. -That's a good question, right? Really. You're so judgmental. Really. You're so bad. What? Having sex is different from making love. Those are two different things. Because here, here, the heart knows who's inside. I know who is in here. Asshole. That's really how guys think. Hey, mister. It's not like that. It's like this: If you're going to commit to a relationship, you need to give everything, your whole self. It includes your body, your heart, your mind, and your soul. Even that dead toenail of yours is included. Commitment is not an installment plan. Again, I repeat: Sex is different from making love. You guys are ridiculous. You're already drunk. I am not drunk. Really? Is that a trick question? It's not. No. you're not my type. I don't like scruffy-looking men. With stubble. You're not my type either. I don't like... Just, you're not my type. It's OK. You'll see. Oh, gosh. The sun's up. Hold on. Give me your number. Let's see each other in Manila. OK. If I go back. C'mon. Too much drama. Well, then, I'm leaving. Now, what I have here is a color-correcting palette. This, of course, is used to conceal scars. The scars of the past. We don't need those. We women should stand together. Let's keep on hoping! Get back up! Fight on! Sir, welcome back. Jake. How was your trip? It was OK. I'm tired. We really missed you. The pests must have missed you, too. There. And here, I drew up on the chart... -Bro. We weren't expecting you today. -Bro! How are you? I just decided to come. I only called Telay. How are you? Are you OK? Jake? Of course he's OK now. So, what now? Gosh, Enrique Gil is so handsome. Look at Liza. What a beautiful girl. It's good she didn't get your genes. You know, Mom, I feel like they're a couple in real life. Look at them, they look so good together. Look at them. That's not true! Love? Already? You guys are so corny. You're corny. -Shoot it, bro! -Here we go! There goes Jake! Who are you courting? I LOVE YOU BABY!! -Hey. -Ouch! What? Even you're doing it? Stop texting Celine like that. -Why? -It won't go anywhere. Don't compare me to you. This is real. It's not true. True love isn't real. There is no such thing as forever. Mom, you didn't tell me that we were having bitter melon for dinner. Or that, for drinks, we were having black coffee. So bitter. Whatever. So corny. Thank you. Take care, dude! Let's drink. Beer. I just sneaked out behind my wife's back. Me, I'm in charge of watching the baby. I can't really go. I have a dinner to go to with Sheena. -How about you? -I still have work to do at the house. It's important. -How about tomorrow? -I still can't. -It's Family Day at Bea's school. -OK. -So, are you coming with me? -Of course I'm going with you. Hey, let me come, too. I'll take a bath. -All right. Take care. -Take care. Take care, bro. Take care. You slut! WANT TO HAVE COFFEE TOMORROW? OK Hey. You're wearing so much makeup. Really? It's because the models took their time retouching their makeup. I played with my own face. -Am I pretty? -It's nice. -So, do you want something? -Your treat? Of course. C'mon. Really? It's a treat then. -What do you want? -It's your treat, right? This looks good. Delicious. It's really delicious. -Do you want one? -You like the view? Good. One chocolate cake. This, too. Oh. You took all of these? I'm not joking, you're good. Why didn't you consider making a career out of this? If I had a choice, I would love to be a photographer. That's nice. Why don't you do it, then? Our family business needs me. So, I can only post them on Instagram. Too bad. The pictures are so good. Is this her? Yeah. You're still keeping your ex's picture? Of course. Those are memories. You know, you girls really like to block, and all the rest. -Isn't that so? -It's not true. -It's not true? -It's not. The memories are already engraved in us. Right? We don't have a choice. Even if we don't like it, they're already there. But your ex is pretty. -No. -Pretty. Is this your ex? Well, technically, Jeric is not my ex. I feel so stupid every time I remember what I did. I'd really hoped that dufus would change. I'll just delete these. Why did I even leave any pictures there? Just relax. -Chill. -Wait. You know what? I have a plan. Come on. Let's replace that Jeric. -Where are we going? -Leave it to me. Come on. -Huh? -Let's go. I feel so old. -Why? -I'm not used to these kinds of places. -I don't like it here. -Why? You'll enjoy it. Especially if I find a guy for you. You're going to find a guy for me? Of course. Members of the opposite sex make the best wingmen. -What? -Let's say, you... You're going to introduce me to the girls here. -OK... -They will feel more at ease because... I have a friend who's also a girl. In my case, if I introduce you to the guys in here, they will think you're easy to get along with because you have a guy as your friend. That's me. -Do you get it? -Are you for real? Charm Check! How about that... that guy. -That one? -He's an addict. The one with the hat, you might like him. So unsophisticated. What is that even? -He's a bum. I don't like him. -Unsophisticated? He's OK. I don't like him. -Why? -I don't like him. His armpits are wet. He might stink. -Wow, really? You're so picky. -He'll smell! Yes? This is Angel, I met her in the bathroom. Angel, this is Jake. -Angel, I'm Jake. -Hello. Hi, are you here often? Not really, Mister. Mister? Don't call me mister. We're the same age. Really? Are you also 18? -I just need to go to the men's room. -OK. -You're just 18? -Yes. Where are your parents? They're at home. -They let you come here? -Yes. My parents still won't let me. Look at him. The one at the bar. There. He looks OK. No, we won't get along. He may not even like girls. He's fine. It's fine. No. My gaydar hasn't failed yet. I can feel it. -Do you want to make a bet? -OK, I'm game. -The guy at the bar, OK? -Really? OK. Fine. Me? -I'm Jake. This is Tintin. -Tintin. -Hi, I'm Mark. -How are you? This is Tintin. Yeah. Be back soon, just going to the bathroom. -Where are you going? -Why? -Stay here. -Yeah. Huh? I need to go. -You just came from the bathroom. -Excuse me. I really need to go. Hey, I didn't notice. He didn't look the type. Your bathroom excuse was so funny. Of course. I needed an excuse to leave. -I don't know what to say. -His stare was scary. -You're his type. I'm sure of that. -That's a shame. I was wrong. You didn't believe me, but my gaydar never fails me. Too bad. You were the prettiest person in there. Look. Pretty eyes. Great smile. And then... You're such a pervert. You know what? This man-hunting is such a bad idea. You know, Tintin, when dating, you just need to relax. You don't have to reveal everything. Just the surface. -The surface? -Yes, the surface. The first time you meet, it has to be smooth. You have to be charismatic, but you don't need to reveal everything about yourself. You don't have to tell them everything like you're in a TV drama. You have to be cool about it. -Look like you're having fun. Just relax. -Really? You look handsome there. You're too much. You know what? It's like I'm studying in college again. You're an expert. You're good. -What are you talking about? -No. I can really relate. You know, that's how Jeric and I started. Through texting. Pretending to be cool. Like that, a little mysterious. It made my heart flutter. It was convenient for me, it was OK, because I didn't have a boyfriend. Sometimes he even asked me out during the wee hours of the night, but it was OK with me. I'd go. Then what happened? I was happy. We laughed a lot together. We talked a lot. Then, one time, he asked me to go with him on a spontaneous road trip. He asked me to go with him to Tagaytay. We drank until dawn. Then I realized I had work early in the morning. So, I went to work drunk. But it was OK because I was happy. And then? There. You don't realize you've already given a lot of yourself. Of course, our relationship didn't have a label because that's the trend, isn't it? I'd always say to myself, "He loves me, too." But then... that was my mistake. I was the only one in the relationship. I'm really stupid, right? Don't think that. Stop it. That's right. We need to drink. -Waiter! -Hey. Let's stop. Tintin. It's already morning. -Damn. -What's wrong? I have a morning job. What am I going to do? I can't drive. Do you have any plans? -Nothing much. Why? -Come with me? Come. Hurry. Just pretend you're my assistant so you can stay. OK. Esang! Right. You know, for some reason, I missed you. -I really missed you. -What? -I really missed him. -Why? What's wrong with missing him? Can you set my things up? So bossy. Are you the one paying me? I'm doing it already. Come closer, please. OK, get the next one ready. Come with me. -Shai, how are you? -Tin, your makeup looks great. -I'd like to introduce Jake. -Hi. -Nice to meet you. -You work fast. Anyway, Shai, aren't you needing an apprentice? There you are. Here's my assistant. He can do makeup, but he's also good at taking pictures. Taking pictures? Submit your portfolio so we can check it out. OK. I'll do it. Are you sure he's good? Of course. I only recommend the best. OK. Let's see. I'll take your word for it. -OK. I'll just fix the models' makeup. -OK. You talk to each other. Leave him to me. Thank you so much. To quote Darna: "What's this all about?" -Please explain. -What's this? -You even brought him here? -I'm only helping him. He needs a job. Are you a social worker? Are you really sure you're just helping him? You guys are too much. Can we just work? Go back there. -Let's just work. -Work. My office. I'm here every day. -Do you get bored? -Sometimes. -It shoots! -You're good. -You didn't see it. -I saw it. So, you don't have time for your passion? What do you mean by "my passion"? The thing that completes you. It should give your life purpose. And the most important thing is... it should make you happy. I'm happy when I can make other people feel more confident and do better. That's just something else. You know what they say. What's that? That's wood that you rescued from termites, right? You restored it? It looks good. -Please sign them. -OK. You know, you're pretty. -We should fix your eyebrows. -Really? -Let's fix them. -Sure! -Sure. -What? -Let's fix your eyebrows. -Yours are beautiful! -Did you do that by yourself? -I drew them. Wait. Do her eyebrows later, OK? You're coming with me. Let's go. This is it. That's fine. We also have termites at our house, you know. This is easy. OK, you'll start from here. This is your place. Here? -Are you ready? -Yeah. You can do it. What the hell? My armpit's wet now. It's really wet. It's because I'm scared. See, my armpit's wet now. You're gross! You're so gross! Oh, you! Smell it. I know you think it's smelly. Thought so. Did you have fun? I told you your office was too boring. I had fun here. -Really? Did you really have fun? -Yes. I did. Tin, thanks for letting me come to the photoshoot. And for introducing me to the photographer. It's a big thing you did, and I'm really thankful. It was nothing. It's fine. Hey, it's still early. Let's drink. C'mon. We failed our first attempt. So, we have to have a part two. Now we really need to pick someone up. What? Picture it. The places that we'll go to... will have many women. Game. Let's go. No, it's OK. -Really? -Yeah. -OK. -Let's go. Sorry. I'm just a little tired. Good thing I met you. You take away my stress. I think you're just exhausted. You could use some sleep. YOU TAKE AWAY MY STRESS--- WHATEVER!!! WHAT?? You know what? I'm hungry. Really? Let's order. No need for that. Let's eat somewhere else. I'm in the mood for some crispy pork. -Want some? -Sure. Do you know the best place to go for crispy pork? -Where? -At the "motmot". Motmot? Crispy pork? Oh, I almost forgot. I don't actually eat pork. I'm a vegan. And crispy pork goes so well with rice. Too bad I'm on a diet. I want to be beach-body ready. WHAT HAPPENED? Want a massage? They say that... But, you know, I'm serious. THIS GUY IS SO IRRITATING. WHAT A PERVERT! I'LL CALL YOU. Like, oh my God, girl! At least be-- -Uh, just a second. My brother's calling. -OK. Wait a second. What? What? You had an accident? Where? What? Seriously? Sang, where are you? I'll be there in a minute. I'll be there. I'm on my way. My brother's girlfriend has given birth. It's my friend! She had an accident. What happened? A cat suddenly crossed the street. She tried to avoid it. So... she hit a tree. It's a secret. Want a ride? No need. No need. It's OK. Just stay there. Enjoy your crispy pork, OK? Oh, gosh! He was a pervert! He even used a crispy pork line just to get me to a motel. Nice pick-up line. I like it. What about you? What kind of pick-up lines do you use when you want to bring a girl to a motel? But, to be honest, I have also used that crispy pork pick-up line. Also, fried beef. Massage. And even this: "Do you want to have dessert?" -Gross. -I'm serious. Girls like that pick-up line. Well, then. What do you do after that? -What? -After sex. I detach myself right away. You need to, because it's just a one night stand. You don't even chat? Not even a handshake? No way. Because if you do that after sex, you might send the wrong signal. For example, if you start to cuddle, she might think that what happened was more than just a one night stand. Or, if she's the one who cuddles you, she may already have feelings for you. That's how men think. Hey! Who the hell invented Valentine's Day? I'll have them killed. Anyway, I just realized, Jeric and I never really had a proper date. Everything was just done on a whim. It's a sign, right? Of? It was a sign. I'm really stupid. What's a perfect date for you? -This may sound a little old-fashioned. -It's all right. We girls want something that is... well thought out. Something that's planned in advance. A restaurant reservation. He'll wait outside my house with a flower in his hand. When you arrive at the restaurant, he'll be well-dressed, looking so handsome. It's that simple. That's the perfect date for us girls. -How about you? -It's simple too. The place doesn't really matter. Anywhere. Inside the car, on the streets. What matters is that... So, you're romantic after all. -I said, you're a romantic! -What? You are a romantic! Of course. So, what now? Do you want to grab some dessert? Oh, shit! I have a phobia of that way of talking. Stop it. I JUST ARRIVED HOME. Thank you, Mom. Sis? I'm going to miss you. Oh, stop that. Go. Tin, I'm really sorry. I just can't contain myself. Just the thought of getting married makes me go crazy. What are you talking about? It's all right. I came prepared. I brought waterproof mascara. Who wouldn't cry, right? Hey! I'm really sorry, Tin. I know that it's Valentine's Day today. Do you have a date? Oh, no. I don't have a date. Maybe next year, right? It's OK. After this, go. Who knows? You might find him today. OK. But, I'll probably just stay. I'm OK. You need a waterproof, eye-opening mascara. Valentine's Day is coming. A lot of single people will cry. I'm sure of it. Don't you ever cry. You got this. You got this! It's just Valentine's Day. It won't kill you. There! -Congrats, dude. -Thank you. Bro, thank you so much. Thank you. Hey, enjoy the food. OK? Tin! It's OK! Go! It's all good. Go! Go! -Thank you so much for coming. -Hi. Nice. You're next. Do you already have a date? Why? Can you take me out on a date? I just want to know what it feels like... to have a date on Valentine's. Even just a fake one. Cancel everything in my schedule today. How about the department meeting at 5:00 PM? -It'll be in Ortigas-- -Just cancel everything. OK? And it's Valentine's Day today. Find yourself a date. Welcome. Wait a second, ma'am. Miss, it's OK if there's no reservation. I'm just going to wait here. Please help her. Amazing. For you. It's you. You're Love-Love. Have a seat. Gosh! It seems almost real. You might be leading me on. This is just pretend, OK? It's just pretend. Good. I thought you might be hungry so I ordered already. Was I right? Food. Would you like to ask for a spoon and fork? -No need. I'm fine. -It's OK. I'll just go to the restroom. The fish is still alive. -Don't worry about it. -It's diving. -Go ahead. -OK. That's the way it is. I called Esang earlier but I couldn't reach her. Maybe she found a last-minute date. But that won't last. I bet they'll break up really soon. You know... there are some that last. -Grandma. -Thank you! How about us? If we were a real couple, what do you think? Would we last? I don't think so. Maybe just for a little while, then... we'd split. But, I don't think so. I think if we were a real couple, we'd last. Because if this was for real, I wouldn't let you leave me. Because if this was for real, I'd let you feel, and I'd tell you every day, the most adorable eating machine I have ever met in my life. is me, because you chose me. Kidding! No, I mean, it's just pretend. It's just pretend. That would be my reply to what you said, if we were a real couple. If. Well, the night is young, I still have a surprise. Your house is big. It's my father's. We live here, together with my brother. Come inside. What is this? There might be termites here too. No. -What do you think? -It's nice! You're finally being serious about this. You told me I have to pursue my passion, so... -here it is. -Good job. OK, I'll get it ready. Hold that. -Why? -Just stay there. -What? -Don't move. -Just stay there. -Why? -You're going to take a picture, eh? -I'm going to shoot you. Go ahead. -How about these poses? I got this. -Go ahead. Like a true supermodel. The Stomachache Pose. This? How about this one. The Headache Pose. The Backache Pose. The Neckache Pose. Now, let's be serious this time. How? Simple. I just want to see... honesty. The truth. I want to see it in your eyes. So many requests. OK, fine. Let me see. How was it? Pretty, right? You're pretty here. I told you. Let's take more. -Are you ready? -Yes. There. Can you turn? -To show my back? -Yeah, turn now. -Like this? -You have a nice tattoo. -Would you like to take a picture? -Yes. Is that OK? What do you want me to do? Stay there. Take a seat. Then... Like this? What do you want me to do? Give me your sexiest pose. What I'll be teaching you today is the ASG, The morning after, don't let him wake up before you. Get up first, girl. It's as simple as this. Oh, no. This is how I look every morning. Sorry. I'm running late. Are you ready? Do you want me to take you home? Sometimes, you really need this. You need... to open your eyes. Because sometimes you think everything's clear between the two of you. But, it's not. It's not! No, I'm OK. I'll just take a cab. Did you enjoy it? I'll just change. I'm so stupid. Ooh! There she is! A. You and Jake did it. B. You and Jake did it. C. You and Jake did it. Amazing! It shows in your face. ASG! "The After Sex Glow." How did you know? Are you a psychic? There! It's written all over your face. How can I not know? You're together almost every day. Of course it would lead to that, right? It was unintentional. Since when did sex become unintentional? Your undies came down by themselves? Shut up. "Did you enjoy it?" What was that? Stupid. I'm so stupid. So what did you really want to say? I don't know that either. Suddenly... I didn't know what to say. you already know this, right? Girls are waiting for you to say something. But Telay, I cuddled her! I cuddled her! Isn't that clear enough? But you know what? He cuddled me afterward. What does that mean? -He cuddled you? -Yes. So what's your plan now? No plan. -Nothing? -Nothing. He has no plans either. We'll stay as is. Normal. Nothing. We'll continue our friendship. Christina. You've been caught by one of those vague relationships before. If you're serious about him, you better DTR. DTR already? So why did you have sex already? You love him? Love? So soon? What's with you? Can't I just... like her for now? You can. As long as it's clear. And again, your expectations are rising. Stop it. So, make things clear between you. I'm not the old Tintin anymore. LET'S HANG OUT? There she goes again. She is Tintin. Tintin said she wouldn't be led on. But every time she receives a text from Jake her eyes sparkle, and her hormones go wild. Tintin's such a liar. Don't follow her example. -Just don't do anything foolish! -Me? Say that to yourself! -Dios Mamajes. -Are you cursing us? You came from a shoot? -What? -A shoot? Yes. How about you? You came from work? Are you OK with just popcorn? Do you want anything else? We can have food delivered here. Anything. Are you hungry? You must be hungry. No. You can order if you're hungry. I'm good. Are you hungry? Are you serious? I'm not used to it. -I said I'm not hungry. -OK. Just tell me if you want anything. I'm OK with this. Are we good? Is this OK? How about this? Is this OK? This? Is this OK? I thought I wasn't your type. You said exactly the same thing. No, I didn't. You did. I don't remember. No. It's nothing important. Have a seat. See? It's good I turned down the out of town stint. At least we got to meet. So how are you? What's new? Nothing much. Same old, same old. So. Let's order. Hey. Are you OK? What? -Are you OK? -Of course, I am. Do you want anything? Come on, let's order. What is it? -What? -Really? -It's nothing. -What's the matter? Tell me. -What is it? -It's really nothing. Fine, whatever. Well, Tracy texted me. She wanted us to meet. Your ex. Are you ready to order? Let's order. What did she want from you? We just talked. So you've already met. So, you really went to meet with her. I missed you so much. And I bet you really liked it. Can I take your order now? Give me a glass of gin tonic, and also... Bistek Tagalog, bagoong rice, and truffle pasta. When did you meet? Last night. How is she doing? She's engaged. In six months, she'll be getting married. Amazing, right? It's too fast. And me, I'm having crazy thoughts right now! How about you? What did you feel? Nothing much. Of course, I feel sorry for her. I can see that she's having a hard time. I walked her to her car. And then... she kissed me. What? But I didn't kiss her back. What do you want me to think? That you two just played tag? -Jake! -Oh my God, I missed you. So, you didn't kiss her back. Yes, that's right, I didn't. Jerk! Liar. You're cute when you're jealous. I'm not jealous! Why would I be? Are we in a relationship? If you were really my boyfriend, I'd be jealous for sure. I'd hit your face with a plate, hard. I'd get really violent. I'd destroy my boyfriend's cell phone. But we're not really in a relationship. So why would I be jealous? What are you talking about? We're cool, right? We're friends. We're not a couple. We're not a couple. I'm not jealous. We're cool. is my fierce look. Don't be a victim. God is my witness. You don't rule every day. I will repay... all of the hardship... and the pain. You will have a taste of vengeance... from the woman... who has been given false hope! So, he met with his ex-girlfriend. Are you jealous? Did you get hurt? Sis, why are you so affected when you're not official? You're really stupid. What did I tell you? What did I say would happen? "You'll fall for him. You'll have expectations. You'll get hurt." The trash has a better place than you. What about your heart? Stop it. At least the guy told the truth. You actually believe that? All men are the same. Once they get what they want, they disappear. And I know Jake's kind. -Men like Jake-- -Stop it will you? He was honest that he met the girl and nothing happened aside from the kiss. You're giving her false hope. Look at her. -Don't plant ideas in her head. -She's so broken. This can be seen in a positive light. She got her heart broken. All she can do is accept it. Even if he tells me the truth... I can't do anything about it. Isn't that true? I'm nothing compared to his ex. They share a history. He gave five years of his life to her. I am the loser here, from the very start. Mark my words. This is the last time that I'll cry because of him. This is the last time that I'll ever cry over a man. I can't take this anymore. Dad. What's this? Dad, I'm resigning. I respect what you and my brother do, but... that makes me happy. Isn't that just a hobby? It might not be practical. I mean, Exactly, Dad. That's exactly the reason. I'm getting older. And I don't want to regret that I never got the chance to follow my passion. Are you sure about this? Very sure. FRED, YOUR CAR LOOKS GREAT. HOW MUCH DOES IT COST? We're going to go. I'll go with you. Dude, next time, introduce Tintin to us. -I agree. -That's right. Let's go. My wife is already looking for me. -Let's play again next week, OK? -Sure thing! Jake! What now? Freshen up, please! Sis? Can you give me some extra allowance? I have a date with Celine. What? I have a date with Celine. Can I have some extra money, please? -Is that OK? -All right. Later, OK? Oh, Tin. Have you eaten? I'm OK, Mom. Go ahead. What's the matter with her? Telay. I don't get it. Did I do something wrong? What? Is that even a question? But I didn't kiss Tracy back. The point is, you still kissed her. She's your ex. You shouldn't be meeting with exes in the first place. They're your exes. Tintin's having crazy thoughts right now. What should I do? Prove it. Show it. Show your sincerity. How? Boss, you already know these things. You know what to do. I haven't heard from you for quite some time. I'm glad that you've finally agreed to meet. I dropped by you house last night. Really? What time? About the time when... your ex kissed you. That's Jeric, right? Wait, what? Look who's talking. But I told you the truth! Oh, Jake. Don't try to fool me. I don't believe nothing happened after the kiss. I may be stupid, but don't take advantage of that. Tin, I told you everything. I'm not keeping anything from you. It's your problem if you don't trust me and you still doubt me. There! This is what you guys do best. You twist the situation to make it appear like it's our fault. The issue here is about you and me. Will you two take that couple fight somewhere else? We're not a couple. He's not my boyfriend! It has been said. You're right. I'm sorry. We're not in a relationship. At least it came from you. What? We're done, right? You've already said it. So, what's your excuse now? All right. Tell me. Answer me. Do you like me or not? Tin, this is it. Here it is. Let's set the record straight. Do you want us to be a real couple or not? Because I want to. I really want to. -What if I get hurt again? -Tin, can't you understand? Whether we're a real couple or not, hurting each other is inevitable. But the question is, do you trust me enough to believe... that I'll do my best not to hurt you? There. I get it. Tin, thanks for everything. She gave me hope. But... she's gone. And it hurts. It hurts. But it's karma. I deserved it. It's my fault. I have to accept this. I'm sorry for all the things that I've done. I can really feel his pain in the video. I'm such a bad person. I hurt him. I understand, Tin. You were afraid. First of all, you are so happy when you're with him. He makes time for you. He gives you his attention. He cares about you, girl. You know what, your problem is simple. What should I do? Apologize. -Is that enough? -Of course not. Invite him out. Make out, then have sex. Ms. Andre, you're kidding. Don't be too hard on yourself. Just tell him the truth. Thank you so much for the all the comments. You guys made me famous. But there's this one message that really caught my attention. Someone asked me, "Tintin, how to remove makeup?" Gently massage. Rub upwards so your skin won't sag. Then, grab a facial tissue. Not the bathroom tissue you use to wipe your butt. And once everything is removed... what will be left is the real you. You. There. Right? There it is. You've been given a chance to start over. Isn't that so? A chance to be true to yourself. If you were to ask me what I really want, it's to love and be loved. If you love someone, then say it. Tell him. Why hesitate for so long? Why wait? Don't be afraid. You never know, one day, you'll wake up realizing that you've lost him already. That maybe... he's eating pares with someone else now. He's eating sushi with somebody else. He's taking pictures of somebody else. He wants somebody else. Make it sweeter. All right, Vicky. Move a little forward. -There. OK. -Like this? Hey, Jake! What now? Like this? How about The Headache Pose? Jake! Is this OK? Can you touch up their makeup and fix their clothes, please? Sir, is this OK? This isn't enough for you? It's so red! That's enough. -Thank you. -OK, sir. Renren, bring the light closer. Closer. OK. Sorry. Move back! Back more. Boss! What's happening? Are you nervous? Do you want to eat first? Are you hungry? Do it properly. -Tel-- -You're all over the place! I thought you wanted to be a photographer? Do you want to go back to the termites? I won't go with you again. It's so gross! Can I take a look at your shots? Boss, hey. Boss. It's OK, Telay. Stay there with Renren. It's OK. Go. I'm OK. Stay there. OK. We're done here. -We can move to the next location. -Rest for a while. Renren, you can go ahead so you can set up. OK. Help them change into their next outfit. Telay, get my lens in the car. -OK. -Thank you. Please touch them up. Thank you. Jake? I'm sorry I hurt you. I didn't know you'd come into my life. Someone who makes me feel like I'm beautiful. That I should be taken care of. And most of all, that I'm worth loving. I really feel so special when I'm with you. It's like I have a permanent blush on. I know I'm really stupid. I'm such a fool. And I'm a coward. But, Jake, I don't want to be stupid anymore. I don't want to be a fool anymore. I want to stop being a coward. Jake. I'm sorry, but... I can't be with you anymore. What? Just kidding! Smile. Well? Are you my boyfriend now? I love you more. What? What? Love-Love, your makeup artist doesn't seem to be the right one. Huh? Why not? Because they should be me. So, it's you now? Let's go. Sure. This is mine now. No, that's my crush. Do you know what that means? Technically, Jacob's not my ex. Oh, it's Jeric. Please get it. Also, the toothbrush. Get all the brushes you see there. -Now? -No, tomorrow. The... That! The "no labels." Then they'll chase after you. They like you more... What did I say? You're talking to somebody else now. -I don't know, with you. -What? You want me to drop you home? No! -Miss. -Like this. -Miss, where are you? -"Miss." Are you OK? I fell asleep. Oh, my God. We'll end up together. Like a babe. Cut! Let's do it again. This will explode if I add more. What did I say?
