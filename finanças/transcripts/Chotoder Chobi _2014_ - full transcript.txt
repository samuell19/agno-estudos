Shibu Da? Oh Shibu Da? Shibu Da? Oh Shibu Da? Shibu Da? Oh God! He's senseless! Oh Shibu Da? Shibu Da? Shibu Da? a short story Wait. Bilu! Why can't you change them beforehand?- - Sorry, sir. Go and call Khoka. And throw these away! How much? 650. Quick. There's fifteen thousand in this. Deliver it to Shibu's house. I'll give you the address.- - Only fifteen? His's wife said the operation cost them fifty grands. He cracked his spine, they put in a metal plate. Fifteen isn't enough, master.- - Fine, I'll try for the rest later. You know the sales are low. Hardly any audience. Where will I get it? From my own pocket? Here's the address. Shibu Haldar. 28, Majarhat, Baruipur. Go!- - Khoka, let's go. 'Handicapped' Please sit.- - No, thank you. Please sit. I'm not handicapped. Hello? I'm on a bus. I'll call you when I get off. Up and down, Garia station. One for Subhasgram station. Come on! Make it fast! One for Baruipur. Up and down. Come again? Up and down! For Baruipur! Give him half a ticket. One for Budge Budge station. Hello brother... how much for one? 'Mr. Bhrigunath Shastri. Sex problems?' 'India Circus Shows: 3pm and 8pm' He speaks but I never see him He speaks but I never see him Though near, he's quite far, The search isn't over in a lifetime Brothers and sisters, grandmas and grandpas! If you are plagued by tigers, snakes, elephants or rhinos... do not tell me. But if mice, roaches, termites and other insects... do seem to plague you... let me know at once! No help from government. But it's your requirement! Just use one packet at night. Wake up the next day to count... how many mice have died. Keep away from children.- - How far is Baruipur, Madarhat from the station? Ten to fifteen minutes. It's near Ghosh Para. Can you climb on to a rickshaw? I can climb a tree as well. He's sleeping. Didn't wake him. That's alright. You must be totally home bound now? What else? My job in Kolkata has had to be put off because of his injury. I don't even know whether they will continue to employ me. How is he? He can barely speak. He can't even get up to go to the loo. He is paralysed waist-down But his circus days are over. He won't be able to do anything. God knows how we'll survive. I'm trying to pick up small jobs of stitching saris. That's only on the Pujas and New Year. But is that enough? Our daughter's growing up. She should be studying but... she's working at a small office. She says, "Ma, how will we survive if I don't work?" What can I say? The circus master sent this. Fifteen thousand here, please check. Fifteen? But he said the company promised to bear all expenses? He gave this for now and said he'll try for more later. Sold all my jewellery, the rest was borrowed. It's a lot of money. I can't think anymore. How is he?- - The same. She leaves for work at 7am. Then returns at night. Today she's early. Saturdays are half-days. Soma, get a pen. She was good in studies. It's all over now. Give it to him. Go. Write down your number over there. Finish your lunch! Has her lunch at home only on Saturdays. God knows what she eats in office. She can't even rest at home. Attends to her father at night. Says, "You do it all day, Ma." The incident has drastically changed our lives. It happened during his performance. So? Doesn't the circus have any responsibility? He's up. Wait. Please don't tell my father that I am a hawker on the train. Here. Come in. He's calling you. See who's here. Say your name. Shibu Da? Oh Shibu Da? It's me, Khoka. Shibu Da? Who's doing my part these days? Pardon me? Who's doing my bit in the show? Bilu. He's not good. Get Hari to do it. Hari is well-trained. Mind your own business. Don't bother about the circus. Is the circus bothered for you? They've sent only fifteen thousand. Rubbish! Fifteen? Don't worry about the money, Shibu Da. We'll figure something out. The master said that the shows are running a loss. So there's no income. Once sales rise, he'll pay. But... fifteen? Yes, Khoka Da? Tell the master I've dropped the money at Shibu Da's. Okay. Don't forget. I won't be back today. I'll come tomorrow morning. How is Shibu Da? He's as expected... completely bedridden. Don't forget to tell the master. Tomorrow is pay day. No one ever forgets that. Bye. Come! Come! Finally you're back. So they give you a holiday?- - I took one. Keep the bag. Yes. It's there. Make a mix. Get my glass from that room. They paid us five hundred less today. What?! What the hell!- - Where was it? At Ballygunge. A birthday party. That idiot, Bablu, agreed on low pay. They happily paid less. Where's Bablu? He's gone to the pump. For night duty. Sit down. Cheers!- - Cheers! Get me into the circus please, brother. These stupid birthdays, weddings, ceremonies...- - I swear!- - Not worth it! The kids are such rascals! They'll kick your butt, pull your pants... pinch you and even punch! True, Khoka. Please check and see if there are any openings. It's regular income. You know the state of films and serials. Swapan Da used to call us once in a while but now no one bothers. And even if they call, it's rubbish work. They edit out the shots. I've been fooled many times. Even if the pay is less, at least it's regular income. Besides, there's a security. Nonsense! It's a facade. No help if you're going through a hard time. You're on your own and free. You are good. Think we're free?!- - Hey! Our job is easy?!- - I'll show you now! What are you doing!? I can't take it! We're good? We're free? Now try this out! Take it off!- - Why? Can't you see? So just imagine, this happens in March. Now think about June and July! I literally can't breathe. To top that you have kicks, punches and pinching. How do you survive? Khoka, the circus has some prestige. You think circus is easy right? Listen, Shibu Da, from Baruipur, fell through the trapeze net. Now he's bedridden for life. Oh no! And no one else earns in his family. His wife sold her jewellery and borrowed money for his operation. Over fifty-thousand has been spent. Imagine! What! Seriously! Pocha, tell me...- - What? Isn't it the circus's responsibility? Hundred percent.- - Won't they give? Huh! The owner is nice. The master is a thief. He's the reason Shibu Da's family is suffering. He just gave fifteen thousand. No animals in the circus anymore, so people don't come. Now, we are the animals. They come to see us! They pay to see jokers.- - You're right! And they are suffering. Is this fair? What a sorry state of affairs! The way Shibu Da stared at me when I gave only fifteen thousand... I had nothing to say. What coulld I have said? Take off the head. Hey! Open it...- - Yes, sure. Easy! Easy! Go, have your dinner. Come on. Shibu Da! Oh Shibu Da! Shibu Da? Shibu Da? Shibu Da? Here we are. Please get this off me. Take it off! It's choking me. Why don't you undersatnd! Don't laugh! Take it off! Next. Next.- - Come on. Hurry up! Next. Next. Wait outside the tent. Sign here. Next. Next. Sign fast. Let it go. This month is a bit of a problem. I swear... Why'd he ask Khoka to stand there?- - Next... Hello? Come on, move it. Next. Next. Wait, okay... next! Come on. Next. Everyone back to work!- - Come on. Next. Come on. Sign fast. Next. Come on. Not there. Sign here. Get him. Hey you! Come here. Move it! Why didn't you come yesterday? What does 'hmm...' mean? Can't you speak? Is this your father's circus? Think you can do as you please? Yesterday's pay is deducted. Take this. Take it. Why didn't you come yesterday? Because I didn't! I called to inform. Give me my full salary. I don't want your pity. Keep your money! Hey! What did you say?! I said what I said. Shibu Da is no more, because of you! You scoundrel! Oh Dark One, there's only melancholy in your love Oh Dark One, there's only melancholy in your love My beloved Dark One You can be the yield And I'll be the plough My beloved Dark One You can be the yield... Remove this! The circus has ruined everything I had! He's never done anyone wrong. Is this the death he deserved? Even a week ago the man was all well. And now he's gone. 'Kalyani Medical Rat Poison.' When did it happen? At night, at around 3. I hang my bag there, from that nail. He pulled it... and the nail came off. Can anyone survive after 8-9 packets of that? Praise be to God! Hail the Almighty! Let's go now. We'll be late. You guys carry on. Take a taxi from Sealdah. Won't you go? Where? To the circus ground? Don't be late. Go. Let's go. Khoka isn't coming back. Hey, wait! What to do with Shibu Da's costume? Throw it in the water. They won't take it. Keep it. We'll need it. Our measurements are the same. Let's go. Here. Take this. Where are the others? They left from the crematorium... for the show. And you? I quit the circus. After receiving your call this morning, I was infuriated. Since you left, he kept saying the same thing "What'll happen to our loans? The circus has cheated me!" Soma... What?- - Two people in the room. They went to the crematorium too, I'll go serve them. Okay. Keep the post-mortem report and death certificate carefully. Know the way to Kumortuli? Excuse me... Do you know the way to Kumortuli? Of course. I live in Bagbazar. It's nearby. Why? Ma has asked me to go there tomorrow. Tomorrow? In the middle of all this? Yes. I don't know that area at all. If it's that important, I can do it. No. She has to go. Annapurna Design Store. I work there and they owe me. Give him the address. Pith and foil design, crowns, hats, they're all made there. If I don't go, they won't pay. When will you go? 10am? Is Bhupen Babu there? He has gone to the temple. He'll be back in an hour. Let's go. Why did I keep my bag there?! He didn't know that I was a hawker. How did he know that... there was poison in the bag? I'm sure someone spotted you on the train. And told him. Ma was sleeping beside him. She didn't hear a thing. Suicide. You'll lose the life insurance money. Let's go. Accidental death. Do you have any brothers? Then you'll attend to your father's last rites. Gopa had told me about his injury on the phone. But I didn't know it was this serious. Sad! Ma sent me... to see if you could... Money? The circus didn't give Shibu Da his due. They gave him a pittance. The operation has left us in severe debt. In these 18 years Gopa has taken leave only twice. And... Don't keep her at home. Let her resume work once the rituals are over. Are you a relative? I... used to work with Shibu Da at the circus. Joker. They didn't give him his due... didn't the boys protest? I protested alone. They turned a deaf ear. Frauds! Wait. I'll get the money. Praise the Lord. You quit the circus in haste. Now? Let's see. Ask this old man whether he'll employ you. No. Let it be. Ma used to get this work home before the Pujas. Baba and I used to work on the designs with her. Till late in the night. I used to hate it. Only did it so Ma wouldn't scold me. Boring... just sit and paste designs. 27... 36 ...35 ...38... Praise the Lord! I don't have much cash on me. Here's eight thousand. Send him tomorrow for the rest. Take it. I stay nearby in Bagbazar. In the mess behind Girish Mancha. I'll come in the morning. After 10am. After the bank opens. Do tell your mother... that I'll pay her more than her salary and bonus. I'll be off.- - See you. Here you go. Ma told me not to eat anything outside. Tea is not a problem. Don't be so strict with the rules. No one follows them nowadays. The shopkeeper who lived in our building... he died. His family went to the temple and did a simple ceremony. That's all. Why feed so many people? Please explain this to my mother. A bunch of useless people will come and eat. We'll have to invite the entire club. Where were these people when he was being cremated? You can see how difficult it is to get your dues. You have to run around even when you're in mourning. And we're still in debt. So then? Have you eaten anything today? Ma gave me a sago mix in the morning, that's all. Wait. Brother, I'm taking two biscuits. Have a couple of biscuits.- - No. It's not allowed. Isn't your health more important? Your mother's not here. Eat. If eating this means you're disrespecting your father, so be it. Just take it. Isn't this Shibu Da's phone? Yes. Eat it. No one will know. Eat it. Bloody hell! Where had you gone? Where would I go? Tomorrow morning I'll collect the money and come. Let's go. Couldn't you put this off for a few days? It's office closing time. It'll be crowded as always. I'll make an easy two hundred. Careful with the money. Listen... Please try to convince Ma.- - What? About the final rites at the temple. Not just because of the money. No one invites us to weddings or ceremonies. So why should we? If we're considered unholy, then everything about us is unholy. I'll see you later. Hey man! Why didn't you tell us?- - What? That you're dating someone! Bloody hell! You're into it too! Where does she live?- - Look at his face. Why're you bugging me? And why did you run away from us? Give us her name! Let me be, Rocket! Stop talking rubbish!- - Rubbish, is it? I've to go. Come back to the mess tonight, we'll sit. Yes. Okay. Give us the name, we'll let you go. Hey Dwarfie! Wait! Tell us the name.- - Just wait! Why're you running?- - Get lost! Hey shorty! Hey Khoka!- - Oh God! Look at him! Hey small stuff!- - He's really sprinting! Get out of the way!- - Hey man! Not even responding! Brother! There's seat here Our tiny little Best Man. A cup of tea please. Your tea. Oh. You could have given it to me tomorrow. What if you needed it? Sit. I thought I'd lost it. Thank you. I've changed the name on my phone. What do you mean? It was saved as Shibu Da... so I changed it to yours.- - Oh. I had called you in the afternoon. That's when I realised it was in my pocket. Why had you called? Just like that... to see if you'd reached. Okay, I'll call. I'll be off. Get your uncle a rickshaw. No, no, I'll walk it. Though you'll reach fast if you walk it, you mustn't. These roads are so bad, the rickshaw trip is bumpy. Get aunt along next time. She would've come today but she's sick. Soma told me about the final rites at the temple. Do that then. He is my brother-in-law. I told him. He has no objection. I'll take care of it.- - Please sit. What are you looking at? My father's things are all over the house. How do I throw them away? Dip this in the water. In these final rites... as in any other religious ceremony in India... in weddings, birth ceremonies... even in the smallest of rituals... the first mantra chanted... is always related to the Dwarf Avatar. "It is in the second phase of Creation when humans were made." "Dwarfs were the first humans, the most valuable gift of nature." The Guru of the giants Sukracharya, told his student, Bali This being(Dwarf) is an avatar of Vishnu... thus he is Narayana! The Dwarf has been created to serve the purpose of the Gods. "Narayana, the Creator and Saviour of the World... created man and came to us as Janardan." And thus came to being the Dwarf Avatar. Life can't go on sitting at home and sulking, Gopa. If I die, shall the shop close down? Will the work stop? Won't the sun rise? Start working. With all your heart. Mani! Get some tea! Good that you joined back. You'd go crazy staying alone at home. My daughter forced me to come. She said we both need to work in order to survive. Praise the Lord! You did a very good thing. If she stayed at home, she'd brood all day Your father's belongings all over... what's the point? Didn't you say your father was in debt? My mother borrowed... for my father's operation. About forty thousand rupees. The money you sent through Khoka da that day Ma said she'll pay off the debt with it. Most of the debts will be cleared. I don't know how to repay you. Silly girl! I could give only six thousand. I tried for more but couldn't manage. If business is good during the Pujas... then I'll give whatever I can along with the bonus. The Pujas these days are all modernized. Durga even wears denims these days! The traditional wear we make is becoming out-dated. What are you thinking? No. Nothing. I'll get going now. Twenty-five thousand, Mr. Bhupen has a big heart. Count it. You should always count. Come on! You? How did you find the house? How much money had Bhupen Babu given you? Why? How much? Around... about twenty five thousand. What are you looking at? If you don't believe me, ask him. What happened? I told you, twenty five. We never asked for your help. Then? The extra nineteen thousand is your pity? Or charity? Oh no! Not at all! I felt six thousand wasn't enough. So much debt... So... You could've said it was from you! I bet you'd never take it If I offered the money after such a short acquaintance... my intentions would be questioned, Soma. I thought Bhupen Babu is a wealthy man... You'd think he can surely help you with this amount. I don't have a lot of money, Soma. I thought... times have been tough on your family... my mother had a necklace... I sold it for nineteen thousand. If you feel insulted... then you can return it. Does your mother know? Please don't tell her. She'll feel terrible. Swear on me, Soma? Thank you. Hey! Get lost! What happened? Nothing. He's stuck to her. Did you see them!- - Yes I did! A monkey. Very irritating! Where is the monkey? It's gone. It even gets into the room sometimes. Really? I'll show you. Where? Here's the monkey! Oh no! Did Baba propose to you? Or did you? Tell me? I don't remember. Grandpa was tall, wasn't he? Tell me? Yes. Only your father and uncle are short in the family. So much happened? Did they bother to come? But they never come anyway. They're all small spirited. Your father went to their house after marriage. Hold it straight. If tall people can give birth to dwarfs... Can't dwarfs give birth to tall people? I don't know. Why these questions? Nothing, just like that. Your uncle's son, what is he? A dwarf. Even Ramesh and Khuku's kid. If the parents are dwarfs, what will the child be? What's wrong? It's a bad rule! You shouldn't have given birth to me then! What's wrong with you? Why are you saying these things? Get married, have a family... then you'll know why I gave birth to you. Hey, serve the dinner. You're here everyday, what about the circus? He has a private circus at home now.- - Get me some chillies and onions. Get me a pass for the circus. One more. Get me the dinner fast. What's her name? Why do you ask? Let me eat. What happened to your parking job at Sealdah station? They told me to meet them again. You'll get the job. You know why? Normally people need to bend over to take the fee... but you're at the level of the window. You'll collect it straight. You have a quick wit, Rocket. You should have studied a bit. How much per month? They'll give me a commission. Oh. Looks like a good deal. Take it. It's good income. Nearby as well. Hey shorty... What? Should I get you a separate room?- - Why? You've got a job, a love-life... it's time you settled down. Exactly!- - Shut up and eat! Bloody loud mouth! Soma... nice! Tomorrow 10am, Sealdah station. Good if I can crack the parking job at Sealdah. They said they'll pay me a commission. With the number of cars that enter the station... it'll be good money. What is it? Eat. I will not make the same mistake as my parents, Khoka Da. You're really nice. That scares me. I'm getting involved. So what's the problem? No. I won't. I'll support the family. You won't have to be a hawker anymore. Yours is a tall dream, Khoka Da. It's not good for us to be so brave. Should my dreams be small because I am small? You should. No more families. The world doesn't need anymore jokers. All the dwarfs must die alone, one by one. Then we won't have anymore people like us. Then dwarfs, shorties, minis and Lilliputs... with all their pain, disgrace and emptiness... shall be gone forever. Please don't get me wrong, Khoka Da. Here... get your mother's necklace back. Bye. He speaks but I never see him He speaks but I never see him Though near, he's quite far, The search isn't over in a lifetime The search isn't over in a lifetime He speaks but I never see him I look for him through the earth and sky I don't know who I am I look for him through the earth and sky I don't know who I am What is this world of illusions! Which one is me And which one him? Come on. Don't be late. Master... Oh Master... What is it? What about this one?- - Whose is this? Khoka's.- - Put it down. He didn't take it back. Should I put it in the bus? Just put it down! Get on the bus. Pinto, get the bus going!- - Come on, make it fast! "It is in the second phase of Creation that humans were made." "Dwarfs were the first humans, the most valuable gift of nature." No. Okay. I won't force you. I just want to say one thing. If you don't like it, you can refuse. I won't bother you anymore. Please. What is it? I don't know why this happened. I won't ask much of you. Love, affection, a home, a family... I've decided not to bring those up at all. Just one small wish. If you feel that you can't do it, then so be it! I won't mind. Swear on Mother Goddess. Will you be my friend? Will you? Just friends? I will get the parking job at Sealdah station. And you'll be a hawker on the south-line trains. You come everyday, right? Except Sundays.- - Ok. Except Sundays. Please meet me once a day... That's all. Come every afternoon. Around... 2pm... What?
