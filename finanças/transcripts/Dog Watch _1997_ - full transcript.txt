[music playing] CHARLIE: You know, one of these days you're going to say, OK, Charlie, let the truth be known. [laughs] You were right. You will, Sambo, guarantee it. SAM: No, never. Hey, hand me some of the duck sauce. CHARLIE: OK, wise ass, you listening? I'm listening. You're sure you're listening? Charlie, I'm listening. Is this the last packet of duck sauce? Mm. That's it. These people won the damn war, Sam. Sure, maybe we dropped the bomb on them and walked away with a win, but now they own half the goddamn country. I'm not talking real estate. Cars-- they make better cars. Oh, bullshit. SAM: They make better cars, Charlie. Give me some of that rice. I'm not going out andbuying a Chrysler just to have a break down after two months. Fucking treason, Sam. [sucking noise] That's a shitty habit, Charlie. It's good for the gums. And the cost factor. They make better cars that cost less. You see what Detroit isputting out for that kind of money-- garbage. Your wife and kids are goingto wake up someday and find a Jap standing in your house. I'm telling you, you got to get out. Oh, you know you're nuts. You'll see. They're taking over the car industry. Laugh when the Japs areselling your soul to the devil, Sam Levinson. [laughs] There he is. I seen you. You cops must think I'm a jerk. We never said that. Hey, we got to ask, why didyou kill your roommate, Brian? I didn't kill anybody. Somebody stabbed him, 18 times with a knife, just like the one you're holding. James and I were marriedand he was cheating on me. Should've tried a marriage counselor. Fuck you. Get him, Sam. [music playing] [yelling] Fuck. Fuck, my ear. He bit my fucking ear off. Get the fucking cuffs on him. Got him? Bit my fucking ear off! You have the right to remainsilence, so shut the fuck up. So did she give you static? Nah, she always knew I wanted this job. You call this a job? Not this. I mean detective. You're just the tight asskind of a guy for detective. [police radio chatter] I got this one. It's about time. Well, you're very welcome. Ancient Chinese holidays. Cinco de Mayo. [police radio chatter] [music playing] [gunshots] Shooting in progress. Officer down. [sirens] Freeze! In pursuit, heading east on Jackson Street, towards the Chinese mall. [yelling] Stop. Get down. Get down. Put your hands behind your back. You have the right to remain silent. If you chose to give upthe right to remain silent, anything you say will be usedagainst you in a court of law. Secure a weapon. Got it. OK. You have the right to have an attorney. You have the right to speak with one and have one present before any questions. [music playing] BARTENDER: When you going toturn over that broken record, Charlie? They make a better product. Ah, you just saying thatbecause half your clientele are Japs. SALLY: Charlie, you evergoing to admit you could be wrong just once in your life? Hmm? You watch, you'll buyone of those pieces of shit and two weeks later, you're going to be wondering what the fuck'swrong with his drive shaft. What do you care? You don't even drive. Hi, Charlie. Hi, Monica. Me driving or not has nothing to do with giving good, hard-earnedmoney to some foreigner. So how was your night on the town, huh? Family spat between aguy named Dice and his wife named James. Ugh. What's the strongest shit you got back there? 151 proof rum. Give me a shot. On top of all that scotch? Are you nuts? Just get it. [gargling] You are nuts. What's wrong with you? Nothing. Hey, listen, it's about 12:50. He told me 1:00 AM. No, finish your drink. You know Winch, scared littleshit that he is-- sees us both-- he'll freak. Are you sure? SAM: Yeah, I'll get whateverinformation he's got. Hey relax. Lick your wounds or something. [music playing] I got to get ready. BARTENDER: What the hell's thematter with Sam these days? I don't know. Tired, I guess. Yeah. Ain't we all? [music playing] That much girl I know. But it feels the same to me. Cause you know you just don'tshow that you still might have something deep inside for me. Tell me what's wrong girl. Please just set me free. Nothing changing. Tell me baby what is going on. Some kind of something istaking you away from me. Tell me baby, do I do you wrong. Tell me, tell me, girl, oh,won't you tell me please? What the fuck is keeping Sam? You need a ride home, Charlie? Nah. [music playing] Tell me baby do I do you wrong? You girls finished out here? Get back. WINCH: Wait a minute-- Get back! It's not what you think. I can explain everything, OK? Look it's not-- [groans] Charlie? Charlie? Oh, jesus. Charlie, what happened? Oh, my god. Oh. You go around and get our car. It's the blue one across the street. No-- no, I can't-- I can't do that, Charlie. Get the fucking car! OK. OK. [crying] [music playing] All right. SALLY: Why not just leavehim back in the alley? CHARLIE: Ah, jesus, Sally. It's all about trust. SALLY: You're not talking sense, Charlie. A cop doesn't fucking kill somebody. Not even a fucking scumbag. Mother fucker. Charlie. Son of a bitch. Charlie, god dammit. Stop it. Fucking ass. Stop it, Charlie. Charlie? Stop it. No. Let go of me. [crying] CHARLIE: It's all fucking [inaudible] [music playing] Charlie! Charlie! Mother fucker-- Charlie-- [crying] Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Charlie! CHARLIE: Just go. What am I supposed to do? Go home and keep your mouth shut. You've got blood on your face. [music playing] Fucking, fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What the hell is going on? Got a fucking cop! Fuck, Sam. You dumb son of a bitch. [sniffs] CAPTAIN: Charlie, I'm sorry about Sam. I know what you guys were. But life goes on. Now, here's how the caseload stacks up. Halloway and Orlanser aregoing to do the Levinson case. No fucking way, Cap. That's my case. It happened in their jurisdiction and on their watch. OK? Fellas-- take it easy. Yeah, I just told Charliethat you guys are going to be handling the Levinsoncase and if you need extra help, you have it. Ah, I think we'd like togo it alone for a while. Yeah. Charlie, can you tellthese guys anything else that may have happened last night? It's all in the report. Pretty damn detailed too, Charlie. Thanks for that. CAPTAIN: Picked up a floater this morning. Preliminaries indicate thathe was dumped in the Bay either late last night or early this morning. Nobody knows. - Mm. Just another fun-filled day in the city. Did they ID him? Yeah, one of your snitches, Leon Winch. CAPTAIN: Guys, can you get me Murrow? - Sure.- Sorry about Sam, Charlie. Yeah. Thanks. OK. I know you want to keep busy, and because you knew this guy and his world, I'm going to give you the Winch case. I don't think that's a good idea. It's a very good idea. And don't get your noseout of joint on this one, but here comes your new partner. Michael? Oh, shit. Mike Murrow meet yournew partner, Charles Falon. It's an honor to meet you, Detective Falon. Under normal circumstances I would give this to another team. So let's be normal on this one. CAPTAIN: Yeah, no. Uh-- look, he's going to fillyou in on this guy, Winch. OK? And everything, right? You're going to do the right thing, are you? You're not going to be an asshole. And you've got to understand that I know what you're going through. You capisce? I'm old and deaf, but I understand. Be careful who you go to bed with. CHARLIE: Coming through. Excuse us. MURROW: Excuse me. [interposing voices] CHARLIE: There's one smallbit of information you got to understand real fast. There's the law, and there's justice. It's best if you understand one has nothing to do with the other. Me, I side with justice. The law can take care of itself. That's, uh-- a little cynical. Don't you think? Cynic's just a soured romantic, kid. Say, Jerry? - Charlie. Ray. What have you got? Oh, a few tire prints. Some shoe prints in the mud over there. Not much help. No, not much. [music playing] Stick around here, maybeyou'll learn something. I'll call you. Jerry, this here is the shooter from Chinatown. Be good to him. Might get lucky. CHARLIE: Bless me father,for I have sinned. I killed a slimy, no-good, son of a bitch. He took the life of a good friend. My partner was the only thingI had in this lousy world. I just want you to know thatI know what I did was wrong. But I'd do it again, if I had to. [crying] Have you come to give your confession? Uh-- no, thanks, padre, I'vealready been taken care of. Have a nice morning. WOMAN: What is on your mind? MURROW: It's just, it's myfirst homicide assignment and my partners a wacko. What? You don't get along with the man? That's just it. I don't know. I mean, he's got decorationscoming out of his ears. He's got commendations as long as my leg and-- And-- He's very cynical. Well, I guess his partner's death must have really hit home. Hell, you live with a guy thatlong, working together and all, something's got to grow, somethings got to develop between you. I don't know. Do you want to maybe go away for a few days? I'd really like to get to know this guy. We could spend an entire weekend in bed. Sure. Come on. What do you say? We could make passionate love. Mm. I could learn a lot from this guy. You could learn a hell of a lot from me. [music playing] [gunshots] Jerry. Clean and neat, Charlie. Some unwanted guests showup during the transaction. They want a piece of the pie. Nobody wants to share. Bang, bang, guests take the whole pie. Fuck the friends. Was that why? Does Steve Young throw a football like threading the needle? Remember him, Charlie? Jose Alvarez Santiago BentinoDiego, AKA Willy Wasserman. Can you imagine that bill, fucking Wasserman. Certainly you would know them all. Why did you call us? I found this on Wasserman. It's got a name and address. Jeez. What happened to your hand? Caught in a mousetrap. Friend of Winch. A low-life like him doing staying at the Sir Francis Drake? Maybe he likes the room service. One other thing, Charlie. It's nothing positive, but, um-- asshole over there, looks like he was killed with the same type of weapon as Sam-- still wearing it. Ah, forget it. There's no connection. Didn't say there was. Yeah, but why do you think that. CHARLIE: These guys ran in different circles. This is a typical I want what you got thing. [police radio chatter] No mysteries. See you, Jerry. Thanks. All right, Charlie. Hey, Charlie. Marv. And Mike, the shooter Murrow, from Chinatown. Right, right. Yeah. I didn't shoot anybody. Yeah, yeah, so we hear. [laughs] How's it going, Charlie. [non-english speech] And you? Oh, we got a couple of things lined up, should only take a couple of days. We're onto a few things. - Swell. - Yeah. Take care, huh? See you later. Hell of a party, huh? Yeah. [police radio chatter] Where to? Sir Francis Drake Hotel. You don't like the type. Fuck you. Just drive. Good afternoon. Hello. Thanks for the lift. [interposing voices] This character Winch wasone of our informants-- gave us a few tips. He'd call Sam. They'd set up a deal. Nothing complicated. This whole thing smellslike a drug deal gone south. Thanks. [music playing] What floor is this? Six. CHARLIE: Probably got his assinto someone else's backyard. Question-- motive? Answer-- fucking wrong backyard. Uh-- Falon, don't youthink we need probable cause? You don't hear that ladyscreaming inside this room? It's a nice room. [music playing] What have you got? Just fucking dealers. Collect their IDs. I'll check it out. I got it. I'll do it. Let's go. I'll call you later. This sucks. [music playing] [bagpipes] Present. [crying] Thank you. I'm very sorry for your loss. It was lovely. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go home. CHARLIE: Grace? Charlie. How you doing? I've been better. Naomi? She's OK. I guess time will tell. If there's anything I can do-- anything at all. Sure. CHARLIE: Grace? Yes, Charlie? Have you seen Sam's notebook? The one he carried all the time? His thought book. Yeah. Yeah, that's what he called it. Yeah. He was never without it. Right. Take care of yourself. - Yeah. You do the same. Take care, baby. Sorry I couldn't make the funeral. You weren't missed. Yes, so I figured. I've been waiting forthe lab reports on Winch. Been staying after school, have you? Winch was beaten to death-- no weapons. What do you call bare hands? I mean, besides bare hands. His head was bashed in. OK. We pulled two distinct bloodtypes from the wood splinter samples off the dock-- type A and type B. Winch was type B. Also have somegood photos of what they think were the killer's big feet. A lot of people have big feet. I'm only telling you what I found out. So you told me. Anything else? No, not really. Charlie, the only hard evidence we got on Winch now are these foot and tire prints. We're just trying to match up tire prints to a car we ain't found yet. Probably end up in the bay, huh? Probably. Now, uh-- about Levinson. From the look of Sam'sbody, there was no struggle. I'd say he was caught off guard. The scene behind the bar suggests a struggle of some kind. That's what's so strange. Sam's body was clean. Well, there's probably adozen fights behind that joint every month. - Hey, bad luck, huh? Excuse me? Having to work with Falon here-- drew the short straw. Jesus, Falon, why nottry a decent meal for once? Actually, he's workingon that new high-fat diet. This piece of shit's ready. Whatever that means. Thanks, Bob. So, where to? Spencer, Texas. OK. I guess we're going to drive around a bit, huh? Listen, uh-- my wife wantedto know if you wanted to come over for dinner tonight? She a good cook? Well, we eat out a lot, but, uh-- sure. Um-- don't you think youought to change that bandage? What? Are you a doctor now? How did you do that? [inaudible],, the near wife-killer. What? Did he bite you back or something? Head over to Broadway. What's over there? I'm still looking for somebody. [music playing] - Shit. - Get after him. Get after him. Open the goddamn door! Open the door. Open the god damn door. Open the god damn door now. Come on, you punk. Open the fucking door. Stand back. Aw, shit. Oh, what the fuck? What the ruck is wrong with you, Falon? What are you? Are you out of your fucking mind, too? Leave me the fuck alone, for christ's sake. Come out here. That's for making us run,you little, live turd. No more next time, you understand me? Yeah, I do. I do. shit. Now, down to business. Wipe your face. Falon? Sorry, Police Detective Murrow, the Mink. His real name was Harold Kinclowski. Listen, you turd, you'rewhat's known in street parlance as a small-time, no-good mother fucking, ass-licking scumbag of awart on humanity's backside. Deals drugs and shit. Why don't you correct me if I'm wrong here, Mink. OK He uses more than he sells. He's also one of Winch's gophers. What can tell Detective Murrow here about Winch? There's some big deal pending. Winch was in on it. I don't know how. But the guy was setting something up. What about Mink? I honestly don't know. I swear to God. But people on the street,told me to shy away from him. There was something funnyabout Winch, you know? I mean, he-- he wasn'twhat he was supposed to be. You know? I mean, he wasn't right. You could sense it, man. he had his own personal agenda. Agenda-- jesus christ, listen to these people. Something else-- What? Levinson-- what have you heard? Uh-uh, No. Not me, Falon, no. Boil me in fucking piss. I don't know shit about that. huh-uh. No, no, nothing. No fucking way. Fuck. Fuck you. CAPTAIN: Number five, step forward. Turn around. And around. And step back, please. What do you think? I don't know what the hellI'm doing here, Captain. I told these guys there was nothing to see. This is a waste of my time. Mm-hm. Ms. Niece? I didn't say anything. Thanks for coming in. Thanks for trying to help us. If you get any ideas, even in your sleep, will you contact me? Get in touch with me? Will you? Sure. Thanks a lot. You know what we got here, stugots! Doesn't really matter. We know the son of a bitch did it. We'll nail them in other ways. Be nice to have a positive ID. Maybe we ought to talk tosome of Jerome's friends. Bet your ass. I'll tell you something. The same guys that iced the warehouse group also killed Levinson. It's all one big family. CAPTAIN: Mm-hm. We're going to play show and tell. All right? Just the facts ma'am, just like Dragnet. Capisce? Yeah, sir. Take care, Charlie. Yeah. What is this crap? What crap? That lineup. Nobody saw jack shit. I know that kid. He's no killer. Well, they think that he was there that night. They think he's involved somehow. They want to see if theycan get an ID at the bar. Would you follow me please? Shooter, you too. Can you give me an idea of when there's an end to these taxi receipts? Huh? Look at this. Look, if the lousy mayorcan take a fucking limo, we can take cabs. You know what you can take? The vehicle that the San Francisco PD gives you. You are an adult. You are middle-aged man. Get a life, will you? Drive a car. Do you understand, it is at an end. This is not IBM. It's over, finished. I promised myself. That's a pact I made with myself. No more singing the sametune, my friends-- no more. I've got to get out of here. I got to get-- spaces-- I got to get space. Captain? Don't pay any attention. I go to go to the southwest. If you like the southwest,that's where it is. You see, that's where there's a lot of space. Only you need a pony, just like Shane had. Shane. I love Shane. God, My heart is beatingSee, it's medium to high. That's no good. That's terrible. When's the Captain due for retirement? Any day now. Hey? [music playing] Get off Falon, I'll get you, Falon. You bit off my ear, you fucking son of a bitch. Don't hurt her ear. Fuck. Oh, get in the car. I'll get you Falon. You son of a bitch. Fuck. Oh, fuck. No style anymore. Style? What's style got to do with it? Used to be, 90% of police work was style. No more. I thought substance wasthe thing that mattered, no? Take Muhammad Ali, there's aman who did things with style-- made him a champ. We've lost our style. Are you saying that the ends justify the means? I'm saying you got to bewilling to take a few punches below the belt. I'm going home. MURROW: Don't you want that ride? I'll walk. MURROW: Don't forget--dinner, tonight, 7:00 sharp. Can't wait. [honk] [music playing] [buzzer] Charlie? I never took notice of the view up here. Been here a hundred times andI never really looked at it. Pretty nice, Grace. I was just making a sandwich. Do you want one? Yeah. Extra mayo, as usual? Yeah. Shane was telling me that Naomius starting college next fall. Yeah. That's great. Where is she going? Stanford. Really? Big bucks. How long have you owned this place? 10 years. Thanks, Grace. Well, got to go. Got to ask you, Grace, wheredid the extra money come from? I don't know where it came from. It was cash, and there was a lot of it. He said, he was sending Naomi to a good school. Bye, Grace. [music playing] Hey Wally? Hey, Wally? Yeah? Look, we want to ask you a favor. I don't do favors for cops. Oh, come on, don't be like that. Come on, guys, get out of my face. Huh? - Oh, really? OK. Come on. [interposing voices] Have a seat here. Get in. [knocking] The Dr. Falon. Just Falon. Nectar of the gods. Thank you. Please come in. Thank you. Can I offer you a drink? Scotch, neat. Your husband is one of the few cops I know who hangs his hat on Nob Hill. Most live in Oakland. Where do you call home, Detective Falon? Just Falon. North Beach. Hey, Charlie. Uh-- welcome to our home. Yeah. Thanks for coming by. So, uh-- What do you do? I'm a clothing designer. Actually, she's justtrying a new line at, uh-- Macy's. Swell. - Um-- - Shall we eat? Yeah. You hungry? MURROW: Here's to, uh-- my hero. That's you, honey. Are you married, Detective Falon? The only broad I ever had was the job. Broad-- I haven't heard that term used in years. [laughs] Women only make things more difficult. You ever live in Berkeley? Do they? Berkeley's too expensive. Sure as shit, they do. Things have changed. Take this food here. Is there a problem with the food? No, it's fine, for store bought. No more home cooking these days. Women would rather be doing something else, working out at the gym, jogging, making money. You don't like the competition? Honey, did we tell you what happened today? It has nothing to do with the competition. It's roles-- who does what. And you probably think the wife should be at home, cooking and cleaning. Bet your little tooshie. OK. It's her god-given task in life. Ah. MURROW: Come on, guys, yeah, um-- can we just like change the subject here. Just a second, Mikey. Mikey? It's Mike. [laughs] Nobody knows who they are anymore. How about another scotch? How about one? How about another topic, honey, please? Is this how you relate to your job? Used to be the good guys were the good guys and the bad guys were the bad guys. Now it's piss and shit, who's who. Can't be all-- uh--, thatkind of dry anymore, though. No. I mean-- Good cop tries like hell, does his best. What does he get for it-- can't send his kids to a good college, can't afford a decent place to live-- why? I don't think that's true. CHARLIE: Oh lady, look around here. Who plays the load around this place? Mikey, here? No fucking way. You do. Your money. I'll bet it eats at himevery stinking, fucking day. Does it eat at you, Mikey? Could we just talk about something else? He's not going to admit it, at least not to you. What man likes his balls handedover to him on a plastic dish? No clear lines. A good cop gets killed by number one scumbag of a fucking drug dealer. Let's say he gets caught-- he's out of jail in three days. And the cop? They plant him, play the bagpipes. His wife and kids got to scrimpand save just to carry the nut they had going-- bullshit. I better go. Oh, hey, uh-- Charlie, it's all right. Before I say something that might offend. Before you say something? Honey. Thanks for the takeout. Charlie, come on, listen, you don't-- hey, Charlie, are you always like this? Like what? A complete asshole, man. Probably so. I'll see you, shooter. [music playing] You do us this little favorand your made-- nice digs, clean underwear, the works. Fellas, it-- it just ain't right. Well right and wrong dependson what side of the fence you're on, Wally. But there are basic things. We understand that, but we're doing is right-- right in anybody's book. This creep is a low lifemother fucking druggy who we've busted too many times.[laughs] He say's he's trying to clean up. ORLANSER: That's pure bullshit, Wally. You want another round? Hey chief, bring my cousinanother round here, huh? Look, Wally, we tried to help this punk. I don't know. We're being nice. Real nice, Wally. Real nice isn't working here. So let me put it to you like this. If you don't help us out-- [screams] --we'll fucking kill you. Now how's that? Hey, buddy, it's OK. Hey, hey, take it easy. Huh? It's all right, buddy. [phone ringing] Yeah? SALLY [ON PHONE]: Charlie,it's-- it's Sally. Can I talk to you? I'm listening. SALLY [ON PHONE]: No, face to face. I'll stop by the bar tomorrow night. SALLY [ON PHONE]: Now, Charlie. Now? SALLY [ON PHONE]: Please? Where? SALLY [ON PHONE]: Um-- Kip's Coffee shop. I'll be there. SALLY [ON PHONE]: OK. You look like shit. Well, you look about the same. Yeah, we're a match set, baby. I need a little something tohelp me get through the night. So what are you calling me for? We stopped sharing the same bed. Remember? Well, you see, Sam-- Sam used to be my supplier. You're full of shit. And he's dead now, soyou got to take his place. Sam never gave you no dope. What? You've been blind? No fucking way. Any fucking way, he used to give me. He's gone. You sure as hell know whatyour partner was doing? You bitch. I need it, Charlie, now. Fucking hustle me, Sally. You're an asshole. Charlie? Conveniently deaf, dumb, and blind-- is that it? Sam was giving me the stuff. It was his way of being nice. You leave Sam out of this. They want me to fingersome Innocent slob, Charlie. What are you talking about? Hey. Charlie, you owe me and we haven't had a good screw in months. What do you say? [inaudible] I should baby, that's what I say. I'll clean up. I'll clean up, I promise, Charlie. Please? [crying] Never say that about Sam again. You understand me? Do you understand me? Yeah, Charlie. [crying] [opera singing] I know. I wasn't too crazy about her either. - You looking at Burnside.- Who? The passport you found in Winch's hotel room. Look, I told you, these fucking drug dealers got a zillion fake IDs. Can I see it? I forgot where I put it. Let me ask you something. How long before you found Levinson? Hour. That long? You sure? What the fuck is this? Yeah, I'm sure. [music playing] I want to check this guy out on computer. What did Sally Niece tell you on the night Sam Levinson was murdered? She say anything about that? Since when are youinterested in Sally Niece? What did she tell you? Read the report, shooter. And don't you have enough to keep you busy with the Winch case? That's Jerome Johnson, right? Right? - What? Yeah. Yeah. [music playing] Fuck. Listen, what we're going to have to do-- What's going on in here, Vincent? Gentlemen, would you excuse me. I'll get back to you right away. Falon, what is your problem? Who are those guys? What's it to you? And who in the fuck is Harry Burnside? This whole fucking thingis going south, anyway. Harry Burnside was a cop. What do you mean a cop? I thought it best that you know nothing about this whole fucking thing. What fucking thing? It was an IA sting. Some dirty cops were skimmingdrugs off their collars and selling it back to dealers. Burnside was IA. No. What do you mean, no? Yes. He was supposed to installhimself as a drug dealer so he could put pressure on those guys who were under investigation. And Sam Levinson was one ofthe cops under investigation. You fuck, you thought me andSam were into selling drugs? You were cleared months ago. How the hell do you think yougot the Winch investigation? Those guys are IA. You son of a bitch. Hey, go fuck yourself! Levinson was selling drugs. The kind that you find inlittle kids arms, dead. Only he got cold feetand he wanted to get out. What in the fuck are you telling me? I am telling you something simple. This fucking Burnside-- poor bastard-- that night was going to tell Levinson what the whole fucking thingwas about and he got dead. We thought we had this whole thing set up. Burnside was supposed to putpressure on the bed cops, have them turn state's evidence-- ah, shit, the whole fucking thing is gone. Bye, bye. Have a nice fucking day. Ah, shit! Get out. Relax, pal. Get the fuck out! Leave him alone. Let's go. I said, get the fuck out! [crying] [music playing] Ah. Ah. [laughs] Oh, yeah. You 're fine and dandy. What can I get you, pal? I'm Charlie Falon's new partner. My condolences. Can I talk to you for a minute? About what? The night Sam Levinson was murdered. What can you tell me? Levinson leaves, goes in the back alley. A little while later, Falon goes back. How much later? A half hour maybe? Not longer-- say an hour? No, no, no. Couldn't have been that long-- half hour tops. Me and Sally locked up. I asked if she wanted a ride home. She says, no. She only lives a few blocks from here. I say good night to her. I got in my car and I went home. Anything else? That's it. Thanks. Uh-- do me a favor, will you? Sure. Take care of Charlie. I'm know he's a pain in the ass,but deep down, he's a good guy. You know what I mean? - Yeah. I know what you mean. I'll try. Thanks. Now, this has to be done by the book, Wally. You understand? Huh? Yeah, sure. Right. Good. Now, you know the guy from the Cherry Lounge? You even spoke with him onoccasion, about drugs, right? OK. All right? Yeah. Good boy. See what a good boy? Now you led us to this addressbecause you saw the whole thing the other night. Yeah, whatever you guys say. You saw everything. OK? When this is over, all you gotta do is sign a statement saying thatyou saw this guy kill Levinson. All right? HALLOWAY: You understand, Wally? I said, you understand? Yeah, sure. You move while we're gone, you're dead. Very dead. HALLOWAY: Let's go. [music playing] Here you go, darling. Oh, thank you. Will you go check on your brother for me? Mm. OK. No problem. - Ah. Oops, excuse me. Hey! Yo, what the hell is going on, man? Ah, ah, ah. Hello, Jerome. How's it been? Still trying to keep thatnose of yours clean, Jerome. How dare you! You still on probation, Jerome? Man, no. I finished with that two weeks ago. Now, what-- what-- - Still pushing drugs? What do you men want? You used to give us some shit, Jerome. Hey, man, I neverbothered you two, all right? JEROME'S MOTHER: Well, you menhave no right to come in here and talk this way to him. You've always been a big headache, Jerome. You made me ruin a good pair of floor shines chasing your ass through that garbage pile over on Grant Street. Well, you have no right to treat us like this. Now get out! Get out? But we have a warrant for your arrest, Jerome. ORLANSER: In connection withthe murder of Police Detective Samuel Levinson.- What you talking about? I didn't kill nobody. Mom, I'm telling you-- I know you didn't. Hey! Everything will be clearedup once we get you downtown. Yeah, well this isn't right.And I'm going to call somebody. I ain't going downtown. Now get your asses out of my house! Well, I'm sorry, ma'am, but, uh-- Yeah we'll see about that. We're just doing our job. [gunshots] Oh, Jesus. [baby crying] What the fuck is wrong with you all? Oh, my little baby! Oh! [crying] JEROME'S MOTHER: My baby's in there. Now, you had better pay attention. Shh. Calm down. It's OK. - My baby's in there. - It's OK. It's all right. Now calm down. All right. Look, I don't know what's going on, mom, but I'm-- when I get to where I'm going, I'm going to call you. - OK. I'm going to go to you, OK? You happy? I'm going. All right now, when I get back, I'm going to let you know something.I'm going to call you. Just take care of the baby, all right? HALLOWAY: Jerome? What? You want to throw some clothes in a bag? You know, you all you got a lot of nerve coming to my mother's house like this. [gunshots] [baby crying] ORLANSER: Hey. Hey , little guy. Hey, hey, you're not goingto tell anybody, are you? Huh? Huh? Because, you know, if youdo, that wouldn't be so good. You know what I mean? Huh? You know what I mean? Hey, this kid can't even talk. Jesus christ, will you knock it off? Do you want to play with this? HALLOWAY: Hi, this is Halloway. Yeah, I got a 187 at 1310 Allen. Yeah, look, we're also going to need somebody from Child Welfare. MURROW: Told me you'd probably be here around this time of day. Computer couldn't tell me jack shit. Tell me something, Murrow,why did you want to be a cop? I don't know. I guess, maybe, because mydad always wanted to be one. He could have been one. That's what he always kept telling us, and ended up selling life insurance instead. Hated himself for that. The good guys and the bad guys. Nice and simple, huh? Just the way you like it, no? Fuck, that's the way we'd all like it to be. Bad guys got to pay the piper, sooner or later. Now, what's that mean? You want the guy who killed Winch, don't you? Don't you? You're going about it all wrong. Get your gut to lead where you want to go. Fuck this technical shit. A cop should keep hisfeelings out of his work. You do that and you're dead. Let's get out of here. Let's get some coffee. Charlie? You know, I used to think a lot about God. God? I was an alter boy,right there in that church. I thought I knew all there was to know about God. Not anymore. [music playing] That's beautiful. Yeah. Let's go light a candle. First you got to look at the motives. Motives-- drugs, obviously. Look at all the possibilities. Motive, personality are usually connected. A dead person's personality-- live by the sword, et cetera-- those are possible motives. Jealousy, revenge. Your standard fare. Let's run it down. The position of the weltson Winch's face and neck indicate he was caughtoff guard or by surprise. He didn't expect it. He wasn't gotten frombehind, which means if he didn't anticipate the beating-- He knew the killer. Maybe. Maybe even trusted the killer. Or at least thought thekiller wasn't a murderer. In 90% of all homicides,the victim and the killer know each other. They usually have something in common. Yeah, something in common. Remember, physical stuff-- moreimportant than any theories. MURROW: You wanted to see us, Captain? Yeah, I wanted you andyour partner to hear this. Go ahead. HALLOWAY: Yeah, anyway, wesuspected this Jerome Johnson from the onset. He knew Sam from a few yearsback when he was a teenager. What we needed and got was an eyewitness-- Wally Pental. ORLANSER: So we figuredthat the, uh-- same person or persons hit the warehouse, tied that, the dealers there to Jerome Johnson. Johnson was in the process ofbuilding up a small clientele-- big mistake. He hit them. Their friends got pissed and hit him. So now, they're even. And good riddance to bad rubbish. Yeah. Well, we knew that Wally knew Johnson, so after a little prodding,Wally gave us what we needed. Shit, it turns out he sawthe whole thing himself. Eye witness number one. Jesus, and that two-year-oldkid seen all this? Money and drugs all over the apartment from the warehouse deal. Odd. What's odd? CHARLIE: Nothing. Not our case. Now, how fast did you guys get there? I don't know. Couldn't have been too long. Something wrong, shooter? MURROW: I'm just asking. Come on. We got work to do. You want to leave them behind, shooter? Sure. Here you go, Captain. There's something not right. I'm listening. It's just a feeling I have. Some things don't fit. Oh, you're listening toyour feelings today, are you? Johnson had to know the badguys were gunning for him. Yeah? Why put his family in the line of fire? Why not empty his weapon through the damn door? We know he had a full clip. Maybe the guy is scared shitless? Why, if he's so scared shitless, hang back and wait until they bang down the door? Protect his family. Protect his family-- bullshit. Falon, come on. Does he even get a clean shot off at them? - Does he? - No. With 10 rounds left, he just turns his back and heads for the door? Not a very brave thing to do, was it? You know, I don't like coincidences, Falon. You? Depends. Halloway and Orlanser get there minutes after it happened-- coincidence? Life's full of them, kid. Well, it's too neatly wrapped. All right? It's-- it's too tight. Falon-- Yeah. You dealt with Winch as much as Levinson? It was really Sam's contact. But you knew him, right? Yeah, I knew him. Listen, I'll see you later. I forgot something. CHARLIE: Hey, Cap? - Yeah? Can I ask you a question? Ask. Who else in this precinctknew about this sting operation? - Me. - Just you? Yeah, and now you. Want a candy bar? No, thanks. CAPTAIN: Hypoglycemics, like me,have to keep our blood sugar up or we get sick. What's on your mind? - Feelings. Feelings? Yeah. Thanks, Cap. Anytime. How about Halloway and Orlanser, they know anything about it? No. Mm. See how much better I feel already. It works, like clockwork. Put it in, I'm good. COP: Switch shifts with me tomorrow. Tomorrow? That's my last day of traffic court, I tell you that right now. That's for sure. [music playing] Something I can get you? - How about your job? - You got it. Ha, fuck you. Oh, fuck you, too. You should really try this. It's good for the blood sugar. [music playing] I told you. Liz, right? Hi, um-- could you run a test on these-- blood types? And if you get a minute, I-- I need to-- I need to get the blood types of Falon and Levinson. Falon and Levinson-- what for? It's a personal favor. [music playing] COP: Hey, shooter. Can I get the evidencephotos on the Winch murder? What do you need these for? I'm borrowing them. COP: Like hell you are. Look, don't give me any shit. This is my case and I'm takingthe fucking photographs. [music playing] No fucking way. Nice shot. I want to talk to you. Stop shaking. You're making me nervous. Oh, I'm making you nervous, huh? Why are all these people staying away from this Winch kid?- I don't know. Oh, you know. No, I don't. I'm going to ask you onetime, and one time only. Why were they staying away from Winch? I don't fucking know. Ah. What the fuck you doing, man?That's my-- - Am I clear? - Shit. Get off me, man. - You playing with me? No, I don't want to play. I don't know what thefuck you're talking about. Is this what you like? Is this what you need? [yelling] OK, man, OK. Winch-- Winch was a cop, man. [laughs] What did you say? I said he's a fucking cop. Make me a believer. He was undercover, man. At least that's the word. All right? He was looking to, you know, bust some bad cops or some-- some shit like that. Which bad cops? I don't fucking know. But you can guess. Come on. Yeah-- yeah, I suppose I could guess. So guess. Levinson, man. Levinson. Now, you be real fucking careful about this next question. What about Falon? Here's what I'm saying, man,is that all cops are assholes. And that's all-- oh, fuck. Shit. Jesus christ. Falon's a fuck. Man, you should know that by now. Shit. He's a mean motherfucker-- Yeah? But he was never on the tape, man. Never? No. You sure? Real sure? I'm sure. I'm sure. OK. I owe you one. Now get out of here. - All right. Get the fuck out of here. [music playing] [knocking] Hello, Sally. How's it going? Hey, let's party. Hmm? [music playing] [knocking] Hi. I'm sorry to bother you. Your husband here? No, he's not. You know where he is? No, I don't. Thanks. Uh-- can I offer you a drink? You do still drink, don't you? No thanks. Listen, I know you're not too crazy about me. No matter. I think you two got somethingreal special between you. I think you need to know thatI want Michael to be a cop. That's nice. I just don't want him to be a cop like you. Lady, he would never let that happen. [music playing] Oh, shit. More coffee, Charlie? Thanks, Milt. Well, hey. A cop stealing police property from the cops. That's a good one, Charlie. You guys are getting sloppy in your old age. Are we? How many junkies you know stick their shit in their leftarm with their left hand? Well, you know junkies. They're all fucked up. Sam should have kept his thoughts to himself. You two are dead meat. Me and Stanz wanted to bringyou in from the beginning. It was Sam who said no. Why? Why what, Charlie? Why kill the guy? Oh, couldn't have a guy with cold feet. We liked to Sam, but he wasgoing to turn state's evidence. And Sally? Jesus. Charlie, we couldn't take a chance on her saying the wrong thing. And an innocent family-- that was a real piece of work. We like you Charlie, so I should ask, you in? Fuck you. Sam said you wouldn't be reasonable. See you, Charlie. Charlie. Shooter. Been working that oversizedbrain of yours, huh kid? Yeah, not much. So you're getting somelab reports worked up, huh? Yeah, blood types. And? MURROW: I haven't opened them yet. Why is that? I wanted to ask you if I should. Who's in the report? Winch, Levinson, you. I prayed tonight, Charlie. Yeah, sat down in your apartment and prayed. Did you? My apartment? You loved Sam, right? Yeah, I loved him. It's good to love people, butthey can make you do things. Sometimes. Come on. I need to talk to you in private. I had a good buddy once,shooter, a true blue partner. Why did you wait an hourto go out in the back alley and look after Sam? The kind of guy whowould do anything for you. More like half an hour, huh, Charlie? What's time anyway? Enough with this shit. You know, I figured it out. It came to me in Delgoti'soffice, the motive. You find the motive, you find the killer. You hated Winch because youthought he killed your partner. You though he killed your best friend. Sam and I were like the same person. You thought you were dishing out justice-- some fucking justice. Sorry, kid. I got to do this one alone. Milt, hang on to these for the kid. Charlie, what the fuck is going on? These guys want me to call the cops. Seems like a good idea, Milt. [music playing] HALLOWAY: What do you say, Charlie? One last chance-- you with us or against us? ORLANSER: You know we like you, Charlie. What do say-- partners? HALLOWAY: We trust you, Charlie. ORLANSER: Like a brother, Charlie. HALLOWAY: We feel real bad about Sam. But you're a lot smarter than Sam, Charlie. ORLANSER: Right, Charlie? [gunshots] HALLOWAY: Unless he ain't. Did we get him? Stanz, you there? Stanz? Take your time, Charlie. You ain't get much of it left. MURROW: Halloway! What do you think, Charlie? Shooter got the balls? I'd bet my life on it. [gunshots] [music playing] I remember the day I told my old man I wanted to become a cop. His face just lit up like a Christmas tree. That's all he ever wanted to become, you know-- a big city cop. You know what he told me? He said, kid, you operatefrom the heart always. Hell, the head-- the headcan only get you in trouble. You see? He agreed with you. [crying] You and him are a lot alike. [sirens] [music playing] [MUSIC PLAYING - DOLLY PARTON, "AMAZING GRACE"] Amazing grace, how sweet thesound that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found, was blind, but now I see. Twas grace that taught my heart to feel. And grace my fears relieved. How precious did that grace appear, the hour I first believed. I once was lost but now I'm found, was blind, but now I see.
