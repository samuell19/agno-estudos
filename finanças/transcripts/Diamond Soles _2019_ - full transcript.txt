Right now this is not working. I am sorry. You need to find a way that works for both of us. We have done enough for you. Okay? You do not have anything to say? I find this very embarrassing. Up and over, Alex. That's it. Good. Good, good... Morning. Nice. Deep, deep breathing. Good... Lovely. Thank you. Start pulling those ribs down, your scapulas down... Connect. To fourth, please. This is an argument. Okay? Can I please see something happening? Anything? Take it from the grand jeté again. Just do something today. Why are we in this room? Extend... More, more, more, more, more! Hold, hold, hold! Like this, right here... these are very simple moves. It's a développé. Big deal. Anybody can do one. Why are you doing it? What's going on? This is the example of the tension that is going on between you. So you have to pull that leg... Work for it. Rather than just going 'bom' and leaving it there. There's nothing happening. It's really, really boring guys. I'm sorry to say this, but... Hey. I... I think your jump should be more parabolic. Less like a bullet from a gun. Like when you bring your body weight forward, you shouldn't plunge. And I think you would land a lot better. And like, okay, maybe I'm not gonna the nicest, cute little girl at the freakin' job everyday... Maybe it's because I don't like my job. Maybe it's because it's a shitty job. Which isn't my fault. At least I'm in fucking school, gettin' that education... On. Get myself together, get that degree, get the better job. And they'll still be at that stupid fuckin' job, laughing at the cool girl. You know? I don't fuckin' care. Can you get me another beer? You know? Hey. Do you mind if we sit here? And then... and then she started getting on my shit, like, uh, fuckin'... 'Why are you at a dance club... a music club?' 'Like, how do you... you can't even hear the music.' Did you say that you felt it? Yeah. 'And I was like, 'I can't hear the music, but I can feel it!' I'm still talking like that. And then, uh... Who are you? Fuckin'... Who is...? It would've been fantastic if you didn't get it. I'm a pro. I'm a pro. This is a good song. I like this song. Pass the joint. Alright, give me a second. This music is so good. Not as good as the weed in Cali. You people and the fuckin' weed in Cali. The weed gets you high in New York and it gets you high in Cali. It's the same fuckin' shit. It's just weed. It's the hydroponics. It's the rigs. It's the detail. It's the WEED. So Cecilia, how do you know Tom? I'm his sister. She's not my sister. We go way back. That's cool. I can't understand you. Tiff, just... No! This fuckin' bitch. Let's see them moves, dancer girl. What? Let's see what you got. What are you talking about? The fuck you go to Baltimore for? Let's see it. You got all seven second of my attention span. Is this it? Is this what you learned? Fuckin' vibe killer. Fuck those guys. I could've done it... I could've taken 'em! Where are we going? He's such a good guy though. Like, trust me. If we still had Myspace, you'd totally be on my Top Ten. Maybe, like, number eleven. Alright, alright, right. You look... Healthy. At least I don't look boring like you. Oh, shit. You know, I thought I finally got rid of you. Aren't you glad I'm back? Yeah... You know that... It's kind of funny. What? You went to go live your dream in Baltimore, right? Well, I don't know, it's like... It's kinda... It's cute, but it's, like, sort of pathetic. Yo, let me hit that shit. Cecilia Romero. What are you doing here, baby? I call you and I text you and you never text me back... Because you left me. I'm sorry. Did you know that I'm teaching now? Um, by that place by the White Castle... by the J Train! Where we used to hang out... Where I would be puking my fucking guts out, and you would be dragging me... So cute! That guy Julian over there wants to fuck you. I know. Hey, Ceelers. Hi, Benni. I miss you, Ceelers. Ceelers? Just checking if you're there. Making sure you didn't leave me. You always leave me. The tables have turned, haven't they. Oh, god. Oh my god. Oh my fucking god. Where do you want me? God... You taste so fucking good. Are you serious? Is this real? Wait, is this real? What did I do? Easy, easy, easy... Easy, easy slow rider! Jesus christ, alright? Hey. I hope you don't mind a little sprinkles on your birthday cone. Oh, shit. What do you want from me? Voilà. Bon appétit. What. Stop! Stop it! Stop it! Morning, stranger. Hey. You look like shit. Sorry if we kept you up all night. I didn't notice anything. That's good. Hey, do you sleep in your funeral clothes? You just eat my chin cupcake? That's hot. Hey, we're gonna go to Liv. You going to be cool here? Yeah, I'm fine. Alright. Let's go. Oh my god. Cecilia? Are you watching? I'm not watching anything. Yeah, right. You could just say you wanted that. Hm? Said you could just say you want it. What? Shut up. Don't say anything. Don't fucking say anything. Hi. Hi. What's up. Nothing. I got so fucked last night, dude. So fucked. Hi, Keanu Reeves. Do what you love, man, and let it kill you. Hi. Oh, sick espadrilles. Those are really ugly, Jane. Over, back, down, one plié. Over, flat backs, up... And again without me, guys. One, two, three... Down... Good. Over and roll up. Great job, guys. One plié. I liked how energetic you were. I thought that was really cool. Are you still auditioning and stuff? No way. Fuck that. Rich, white assholes telling me what to do while all the skinny bitches get the callbacks? No thank you. The bags under my eyes are getting really bad. I don't think so. They're getting really bad, bud. Maybe you should stop getting fucked up every single night. Fuck that. Maybe you should get plastic surgery. Come on. Hi! Hi. How are you? Hi, baby. Hi, guys. How's it going? Good. How are you doing? Good. Getting down on some popsicles. Maybe she's come in a couple times stoned, but like... Whatever. Who gives a shit? It's not his business. And it's not, like, getting in the way of anything. And then she took off all her shit, threw it in the sink, and left and just didn't come back. And no one's heard from her. Yeah, so, it was kind of funny... But, like, at the same time really awkward and uncomfortable for everyone. And yeah, I'm just getting overwhelmed about not accomplishing anything... You're doing that fuckin' look. What look. How's your bro, bro? I have no idea. You don't talk to him? No. He's an asshole. You know, you're an asshole too. Are you fucking anyone? No. Are you? Yes. I'm fucking Liv? Okay. Why you gotta ask that? You can't handle that shit. Why can I not handle that? I like Liv. You always judge me based on the past. And... I'm not sixteen anymore. I'm not gonna freak out just because you have a girlfriend. The fuck are you talking about... People change, Tom. Let's not get into that. But... I'm spinning tonight. Oh, you're spinning? Is that what you call it? Oh my god... Who the fuck are you? Yo, did you see this? Oh my god. Fuck off. Find me something, come on. Ja? Ja. Ja? Ja. Ja. Ja. I'm having a panic attack. What about some pants? Yeah. Ja? Ja. Can you see your face in these? Enjoy your day. You too, Lee. What. Nothing. I guess I knew when I left that I would miss a lot. And that people would be different. But I guess that... Actually coming back and seeing things change is... I don't know. It's kind of jarring. People are doing different things and... Meeting new people and... I don't know. I guess it makes me realize how insignificant I am. Which makes sense because I wasn't really ever friends with anybody in the first place. That's not true. No, it is. I'm disconnected. I've always been like that. But I think... I think I'm just jealous that you're happy. Or seem to be happy. I feel like I should be. I left New York on my own terms to do what I love. And do the thing that I feel most connected to and that I can lose myself in and that makes me feel something. But I feel like I've been stuck doing this version of it that makes me feel nothing. And I don't even know why I'm still there, or what I'm really doing. It makes me feel like a fraud. I guess I just don't feel connected to anything right now. Um... Do you want me to say something encouraging? No, you don't need to say anything. Good. Sorry. Alright, it's cool. I gotta finds me something sexy. And I put it out there, and yeah... That's why I'm awesome. But no. I think it's funny when an artist will be doing an interview... And he likes to talk about his poetic process. And he's like... He'll say some bullshit like, "Ah, yeah, I need to be in my Williamsburg loft pad listening to Bach..." "Sipping on some chai tea after a long, hard bike ride on my fixed gear..." "With the bike seat that's kinda shaped like a cock." "Yeah, it really gets my artistic flow going." Nah, man. Fuck you! You're all full of shit. There's a formula. No one writes their own shit anymore. Fuck you. All the good artists are hidden anyway. They just write for the people that have the fattest asses and most followers on Instagram. Yeah. Whatever. Doesn't matter though. As long as people come to my show, and they like my music... And they drink drinks... And I get laid afterwards. That's fucking awesome. If you don't like my music, fuck you. I don't give a shit. I'm not original. I'm not gonna judge you. Alright. Well, first of all, the way I get like half the people to come to my shows anyway... I never told anyone this. Alright, so on Tinder I just swipe 'yes' to everyone. And... And, like... I'm mainly matched with uggos because all uggos, you know... Alright, whatever... So I fuckin'... I swipe on the uggos and then I'm like... Yo, you should come to my show. It would be really cool if you came... Your hair totally smells like strawberries. No, it doesn't. You know, like, how I was saying before. You know, how, like, this whole scene is so, like, trivial with, like whole... I don't know... With the music, and the drugs, and... All I need is music. That's it. And maybe a little bit of hard alcohol. So how about you Cecilia? What's going on with you? What's going on in that head of yours? Nothing. Nothing? Come on, really, nothing is going on? You're just... you're SO wound up! Like, I just wanna SHAKE YOU... I just wanna, like, get you out of your skin. Let's do this. I don't give sex. Only blowjobs. Let's go! Come on, suck it. Dave, this is Cecilia... Cecilia, Dave... Dave is the best fucking promoter in New York City... And this is his super hot girlfriend! You know what I'm gonna do when I win all your money? I'm gonna buy your mom. Buying your mom! Buying your mom! Your mom... Let's just go straight to your mom's house, alright? Take me there, take me there. It is a Tommy kind of day. Want to do one for fun? Hey. Hi. You mind? I've been looking for you all over... You have? Uh-huh. Don't be a dick, Cecilia. Cut this autistic girl shit. I wanna go. I wanna go! Now?! You're a fucked up person. Can I finish my beer at least? Alright, motherfuckers. One last sip for the road. That's what I like about you, Dave. You always know how to share. Omar is arriving now. Who's Omar? Fuckin' Uber driver. Get up. Get up. Get up! Get up! I think there are ghosts in here. What? I think there are ghosts in here. Shut up, come on. Let's go, let's go. What. What. It's pretty. Wait... Wait for it. I bet all your songs are about me. I got an idea. Come here. Come here! I'm really not tired at all. What are you doing tomorrow? Nothing. Do you miss me? Mm-hm. Do you think about me? Uh-huh. Do you love me? Tom... I know you didn't fall asleep that fast. No. Fuck off. That's probably a good idea... Wake up. Hm? Wake up, get the fuck out. What? Get the fuck up. What? You piece of shit. Get the fuck out of my apartment. Is it coming to you now? Don't act like a fucking child. Get the fuck out of my apartment. You're the same fucking person you were in high school, and you don't change! So get the fuck out! Come on, get out of here. Come on, come on. Cecilia. You just show up out of the blue? And fuck with some guy that you used to know... Is that not completely fucking psycho to you?! I don't know what the fuck is going on right now. God, you're fucking pathetic. Fuck you. No. No. You're fucking out of your mind. Don't touch me. And I'm not done talking to you. I'm not interested. Cecilia, just STOP IT. Stop being a psycho and talk to me like a HUMAN BEING... because I'm trying to help you. You fucking don't know me and I have nothing to say to you. Okay? Don't touch me. Then leave. I said don't fucking touch me! Go, come on, go. Fine. Tony. It's your sister. My mouth tastes like puke. The fuck are you doing? What's that smell? It's ME. Take the whole fucking bed, why don't you. You're going to take a number, sign in, remember your number as well. Please don't lose it. Keep your things to one side... We're going to be looking at technique, we're going to be looking at type... Don't waste our time, we're not going to waste yours. Good. Looking good, ladies, looking good. Alright. Any questions? Yeah. What count do we switch the bevel on? On four. Great. Yeah, good. Anything else? Let's do it again, then we're going to go in groups. Looks great everyone. Keep it up, here we go. Thank you. This is one... Five, six, seven, eight and hit it... Eyes never left me. No, don't be annoyed. You were SO fierce. He was looking at you too. Not as much as you though. I mean with that wrist... Pretty fierce, right? It was one of your best auditions I think I've seen. Oh my god. Really? Absolutely. So sweet. Is Cecilia Romero in here? You alright? In here. Nice work, ladies. Very good, very good. Okay, can we see Sarah, Jessica, Cecilia and Kristen? That's the next group, please. Alright, thank you, group two. Let's take it from the top? Thank you. One. Just keep going. Please keep dancing. - Great. - Okay, that was amazing, great, thanks, good work. Everyone hold tight for a few minutes, yeah? Thank you. Alright, thank you everyone. We're gonna be having you do another combination shortly. But just take a few minutes, get your breath, get your mind right, and we'll start learning it. We'll make a cut before then but just give us a few minutes. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you, ladies. Great, great work. Thanks for all your hard work. Make sure you have your personal belongings with you when you leave. Get the fuck out of my house. Come on, dogs. Come on, man. You never wanna do shit. Here, come on, we're gonna do shots... We're gonna do shots. Hey! Hey! Hey! Shots off of me, shots off of me. Come on, yeah, I'm serious, jackass! My fuckin' sister just walked in the fuckin' door. You take too many damn hits of the weed! Aw. How you doin'? Fuckin' Christ, you're so fuckin' boring. Why are you so contorted? Why do you look so fucked up? How you doin'? You okay? Got some kinda fuckin' problem goin' on in there? Got some fuckin' inflamed, burning sensation? Some kind of infection? My fuckin' baby sister... The most beautiful fuckin' girl on the block. Well, it's good to see you and I'm glad you're alive. But you can't stay here. Because, uh, you know, other people have their own fuckin' struggle. So. You know. Hit the bricks soon. But I love you and, uh, I know you're gonna be alright. Because you're fuckin' hot. And I know you were, like, watching kinda with your eyes where I put that shit... If you touch my fuckin' weed, I swear to god I'm gonna fuckin' come back into this room and I'm gonna fuckin' like... THROW YOU AROUND.
