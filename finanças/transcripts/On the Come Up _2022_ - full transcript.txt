That's me. Hey! Hold up, I'm coming. I'm coming. Do we have to go? I don't want to go. Where are we going? - Go on to the car. You're going to your grandmother's house. You're coming with us? I'll be right there. I need you to be a good girl, okay? I lost my innocence the night she left. In this fairytale, my father was once a king. Now, I'm chasing his dream. The greatest rapper Garden Heights had ever seen. Lawless. He passed his gift to me. This is my come up. Hey, Pops. Hey, yo! The Ring Legend-in-the-making. What I tell you? You said I was gonna get on the list. That's right, and you did. My little niece is about to battle in this ring. Man, you know Law must be gangsta walking in heaven right now. You know, people will kill for a spot like this? Yes, I know. Aunt Pooh is my manager kind of like Suge Knight was to 2Pac. And this is the Ring. The Hunger Games of hip-hop where my dad got his start. It's like the rite of passage to make your mark. The force is strong with this one. I was tripping when I saw your name on the list tonight. I'm going to come and see you when you go up, right? You better. I'll be there. All right, so, listen, what's probably going to happen is that the Hype is gonna have some kind of mumble rapper that got a SoundCloud, all right? So, what you gotta do to stay focused is stay in pocket, you feelin' me? Words. Flow. Words. Flow. Aunt Pooh! Okay, but I'm the manager, all right? It is my job to worry. Okay, but I said I got it. Ready to dust whoever they got. Ooh! You going to dust him? All right. Because, listen. Remember. You cannot spell "Brilliant" without first spelling "Bri."...first spelling "Bri." That's right, young lady. I got bars so don't be hatin' me. Yo, you heard about Infamous Millz? You heard Infamous got a record deal? What? Mmm-hmm. Seven figures, straight up front. Somebody from the Garden got a record deal, man? Yeah. I can't even imagine that kind of money. I can. Man, if I had money like that, I'd be straight up out of here. You'd leave the Garden? Hell yeah! Are you kidding me? I would go down South. Buy me a bungalow. And I'll be out there, sipping on Coronas like Snoop Dogg in that commercial. So, you win this battle, the sky's the limit, baby girl. Garden Heights. Let's make some noise! You ready? Yeah, Bri. You got this! You gonna be hard! All right, y'all know what time it is. It's time for the Rookie Royale. Two rookies will battle it out for the first time in the Ring. That's right, and we draw two names. Coming to the stage first. He goes by the name of M-Dot! 7 Coming to the stage second. She goes by the name of... Lil' Law. The champ is here! Now, the winner of this battle is going home with $500. Lil' Law, you call it. Tails. It's heads! M-Dot, you go up first. Let's go! Uh-oh. Wait a minute. Now, now. M-Dot ain't playing no games, all right? Because if she anything like her daddy was, she gonna bring the heat. Nah, nah, nah, nah. She prolly like her momma, trying to sell ass for a hit. What the hell you just say? Say it again! Oh, come on. You heard him. He's talking shit about Jay. Do something about it, all right? Bring it, Lil' Law! Remember what I told you, girl. Okay, okay, okay. Words. Flow. I need you to be a good girl, okay? Do you, Bri! Do you! Jay got clean three years ago Morning, baby. Hot water shut off. Yeah, they shut it last night. It's already freezing. Now we gotta take cold showers? Brianna. It's for pocket money. You going to the Ring tonight? That's the last place I wanna be. Good. Because we're having something special for dinner. What? Something special. Just make sure you're home. Hey, Mama. Morning, baby. What up, Lil' Bit? Heard what happened at the Ring last night. Tough loss. You lost? You didn't tell me that. You were so excited. What happened? Nothing. Bye, Mama. Bye, baby. Bye, Brianna. Choked. Lil' Bri, let me get a Twix. Hey, why aren't you answering your texts? You know why. You saw the battle. It wasn't that bad. He's lying. Malik. God doesn't like liars. Okay. Yeah, we saw it, but on the bright side... Check it out. What are you doing? You're a meme. What? Oh, my God. I'm a joke. I went from a nobody to a joke. - No. I mean, it's going to blow over, though. Yeah, right. You know what? Cardi is going to do something random on TikTok. Everybody is going to just forget all about it. Trust.Facts. All right, let's move. Keep moving, let's go. Bag. What? Let me see your bag. Let's go. Keep it moving. Keep it moving. Dude. What? Long and Tate stay on some mess. And Long is Black too. Okay? Like that matters. I mean, they don't even do this with everybody. Just us because we're the "diversity initiative." Why are you frowning at me? She did the voice. Keep it moving. Let's go, let's go. Let's move. Yo, do you have any Skittles? I got homeroom first period. And I need something to wake me up. Yeah, I got you. Thanks. What are you doing? What do you mean, "What am I doing?" You know I'm not taking money from you. No.We've known each other since womb days. Hey, look, you are a businesswoman, all right? And I'm not like them Black people that don't support it. It's actually two dollars, but... Is it? It's two? Well, I appreciate it.Yeah. What class you got? Chem. Chem? With who? Ms. Johnson. Johnson? Yep. Y'all got a test? Yeah. Yeah? You going to kill it? All right. Hey. What have you got there? Nothing. Just books. Hand over the bag. No, I don't have to. - Hand over the bag. - I said I don't have to. You got something to hide? No, I don't. Give me the bag.Stop. Contraband on school property. Yo, what are you doing? No, stop. Give that. Hey, what are you doing? Bri! BRI: Stop. I'm going to record this. What are you doing? Stop! Told you to show me what you had. Bri! That's why you ain't want me to look? What'd she do? What'd she do? You're hurting her! Stop! SONNY: What'd she do? Dude, get off of her! Get off! Get off! Stop! Brianna, what in the world happened? Why didn't you call me? They tried to call the church. They said you don't work there anymore. Why the hell was my daughter handcuffed like a criminal? Mrs. Jackson, please sit. Now, I'll be the first to admit that Officers Long and Tate used excessive force. They put Brianna on the floor. Threw. They threw me on the floor. Excuse me? Brianna has been selling illegal contraband on campus. It's candy. Y'all could have killed me over a pack of Skittles. You violated school policy. The only reason y'all found out is because Long and Tate like to go after the Black and Latinx kids. Y'all don't do this with none of the white kids and we all know some of them sell actual contraband. Our security guards have the right to conduct random searches. I can assure you you were not targeted. Bullshit! Brianna. This isn't the first time we've had this kind of behavior. I've spoken with her teachers and Brianna is frequently aggressive. That's a lie. Bri, please. Grown men manhandled my child. Brianna will have to serve a one-week suspension. Oh, my God. Superintendent Cook will be calling as our investigation continues. You don't need an investigation to know those guards need to be gone permanently. Come on, Brianna. You okay? You lost your job. I didn't want you to find out like this. But, yes, I did. The Church daycare got damaged. Insurance company wouldn't pay for it. The pastor and the elders board had to adjust the budget so... They let me go. Well, it's almost the first. What are we going to do about rent? I'm looking for work. And I can pawn... I can pawn a few things to hold us over. God got us. Here. No. No, Brianna. Not your daddy's chain. It's yours. I'm going to take care of this. Yeah, but what if you don't find a job? I will. Okay, but what about food and heat? And what if we get evicted? That's not going to happen. That's not going to happen. You don't know that. Brianna. Brianna! Next time I'm at your school, you point those fools out, you hear me? And I'll handle it on spot, no questions asked. You should have said something, Bri. I would have whooped them guard's ass. They're not even worth it, Scrap. It's not a matter of that. Jay's out of work, Trey's busting his ass slinging pizzas, and I'm here, wasting my damn time. All right, it's time to get busy. I got something special for y'all. Milez is in the house. I hate this song. I'm... You what? You going nowhere. Stop being dramatic. Yeah, yeah. Join the hype. Make some noise. I can't hear you. I said, what up, Garden Heights? This shit is a bop. What up? Yeah. It's your boy, Milez with a "Z", the Swagerific Prince! He makes one trash-ass song and now he think he's Drake. Our first MC battling tonight is the superstar himself. Milez, I've been playing your songs on my radio station all day. And you blowing up on SoundCloud. That's because I'm putting on for that Garden all day, every day. I can't forget to give the biggest shout out to my pops here, Supreme, you know that. I know you all feel him and everything, but the second MC coming to the stage goes by the name of Kill a Manjaro. Kill a Manjaro, where you at? I guess with a name like Kill a Manjaro I wouldn't have showed up either. No show? Okay, so y'all know what that mean. The floor is open! Open! That's right, and anybody that wants to get in the Ring and battle with Milez, get on in here now so you can win $500. You know that should be you in there. What do you want? A repeat of what happened last time? You think Law won every battle? No! I've seen him freeze, stutter, do all kinds of stuff. Forget his words, all of that. But you know one thing he didn't do? He didn't quit. He came back into this Ring every single night and battled. So what are you going to do? I don't know, Pooh. Today's been a lot. Like Jay and the security guard. Yeah, yeah. And that's exactly what you need to work it out here. Use it as fuel. Come on! Who's ready to win $500 cold cash? Yeah. Oh, my God. You gotta be kidding me. She's here for another beatdown? Shut up, Hype. Our second MC is Lil' Law. Call it. Heads. Tails it is. Milez, winner goes first. Let's get it. Let's go! It's easy! It's too easy! Say it again! Say it again! Hey, chill out, Bri. You heard what he said? Do something about it because he got you right where he wanted. Y'all know the rules. Ain't no holds barred this side of the Ring. Even Lawless was fair game. You ready, Lil' Law? Yeah. Let's get it. Words. Flow. Words. Flow? Murder. Wack-ass father. Ooh! Yeah! I'm sorry, son. You just got murdered. That was a homicide. And you know here at Jimmy's, the people decide. Yes! That's what I'm talking about! Lil' Law's the winner! Lil' Law. Girl, you know I got to get a pic for the 'Gram. Okay. Okay. Must be nice. But then again, you earned it. Made Milez look like a damn fool. And I won't hold that against you. His head was obviously somewhere else. Well, his head wasn't somewhere else when he said that wack line about my dad. Yeah, definitely Lawless' kid. Mad over a line. Milez is just trying to get under your skin. Nothing personal. You want to talk to my client, you need to talk to me first. You're in artist management? Mmm-hmm. Thought you were still slinging on them corner, Pooh. No, I bossed up. And I hope one day I can wear a fake-ass Armani suit just like you. I was just congratulating the young lady. Hold on to her. You all have a lovely evening.Mmm-hmm. Milez. Later, y'all. Yo, he's trying to steal you away from me. Ew. No, thanks. So what's the story with y'all? Ain't no story. Okay. Then why you acting like that's your ex that cheated? I never liked his slimy ass, okay? That's it. Ever since he managed your pops... Mmm-mmm. But enough about all that. On a good note. Bang! Some real stuff. Here you go. Check that out. Yeah. Yo! Exactly. I got you, baby. Don't even front. And, matter of fact, I booked a couple of weeks of more battles. We just getting started. That ain't nothing. What's up, dread? What y'all suck as even doing here, man? This is more money than I ever have... Pooh! What? Y'all niggas need to back up. I'm not gon' say it again. MAN: Or what? Or I'm going to deal with you. Leave it alone, Aunt Pooh! Yeah, listen to that little bitch. Who you calling a bitch? Watch your mouth, nigga. Y'all think y'all running shit. We run this shit! This is Garden Heights, my G. I own this! What you talking about, boy? - What you doin'? Break it up. Back up. I said back up! You need to watch your mouth. Or what? Back up! Bri, get in the car! You tripping, Pooh! You crossed the line. You pulled a gun out? What's wrong with you? Go on. Just go on. Get out of here. Your mother is going to be so pissed. Compliment her hair or something. I got it. Because I don't feel like hearing her mouth. She right here. Thank God, Trey. She's home. Oh, no. I'm going to kill her first. Where the hell have you been? You had me worried sick. Listen, we were at the Ring, all right? It was my fault. Who else's fault is it going to be, Pooh? You know better than to keep her out this late. Relax. We just got caught up. But I knew you'll be mad so we got some groceries from Carter. I don't want your bribe. You want to throw your life away? Fine. But don't drag Brianna into your mess. I won. Won what? The battle at the Ring. I won. Look, me and Pooh got these groceries with the prize money. Here's the rest. It's a lot of money. She's a natural. She owned the stage. It was crazy. Good for you, baby. Thank you. Give me that. So, Jayda... I was at the market, right? And I'm in aisle two and I was like, "Is that Velveeta?" I thought, "Now, Jayda knows how to make "that good mac and cheese that Grandma know how to make. - Uh-uh. "That yummy, yummy, gooey, mac and cheese." I ain't your chef. You want food? Make it yourself. No, Jayda. I don't know how. Here, take it. Jayda, come on. I don't want to do this. Take this knife. Let me put on some music. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Here. Put this in the fridge. Pooh, really? I love his voice so much. Yeah, there's nothing better than Law, yeah? And he loved to have a good time too. Sis, you remember all the fun times we had? Best days of my life. Mmm. Mmm-mmm. Till I had you and Trey, of course. So, your mom told you, right? About how I introduced him to her? What? I didn't know you knew Daddy first. Yeah. Pooh played matchmaker. Surely did, when she wasn't acting all stuck up. I was not stuck up. Jayda, you going to lie in front of your daughter? I was not stuck up. She was stuck up. And she thought you couldn't tell her nothing. She thought she was the Ms. Garden Heights. I was. I had to be her bodyguard. Yeah, you were a cockblocker. That's what you was. So, how did you meet Daddy? Well... One day, Pooh came home and told me she met this rapper who needed girls for a music video. And I told her I wasn't shaking my ass for nobody. And... But she convinced me to do it. - Mmm-hmm. I get there and... Here comes Lawrence. All that energy. That big, sweet smile. And that was all it took for me. Did you always know he was going to be big? I did. He would have been really big. Not just Garden Heights big. I literally have never seen so many comments in my entire life. "Get lil' sis a record deal." Yo, that's crazy. "Someone call Meg Thee Stallion, get her on a feature." Let's go, Breezy. Oh, my God, all hail the Queen of the Ring. Queen, I am not. Okay, Yoda, you really killed that. You really spoke from the heart. It's not an easy thing to do but I am not surprised, you know. I was nervous. What? You didn't look like it. Have you seen these comments? You're hood-famous, Breezy. Oh, my God. They're about to hit you with the blue check mark. I didn't think it would blow up like this. I'm sorry. What? Not "it." You. Don't go acting brand new around me because I'm on my come up. We're not acting brand new! It's you, babe. How you feelin'? How is suspension treating you? Oh, yeah. School is hell a boring without you. I mean, it's cool. I got a battle tonight so I'm writing raps. Trying to stay out of Jay's way because she's doing interviews. That's what I'm saying. This whole thing just gotta blow over. You know, let all the rumors die down. Let people get back... Wait, what rumors? What rumors, Sonny? Okay. Some kids were saying that... Some of the parents were cool with you getting body slammed because... they heard you were a drug dealer. What? But I'm not a drug dealer. Yeah, I know that, but, I mean, you know how white people are. We're all drug dealers to them. Man, this is some bullshit. Why would they think that about me? Because it's not being cleared up. All right, but it's not like we're gonna let it slide. I mean, a group of us we're gonna go to the administration and we're going to demand for some change. I mean, fact is they need us at that school, right? And if word gets out that they harass their Black and Brown students, then it will be over for them. Malik, what does this have to do with me? I videotaped what Long and Tate did to you. And I was thinking we could... do, like, a hashtag. Maybe #JusticeforBreezy. Woah, woah, what are you talking about right now? A hashtag? The video. It didn't show that you actually did something to deserve it. No! What would I look like being a hashtag? I'm trying to be Lil' Law. I don't want to be the poster child for them. I told you she wouldn't be... Okay, but, Bree... Can you please let me fix this? Because I feel like if I hadn't bought those Skittles, I feel like none of this would have... I said no! ...happened. Look, I got to get ready for this battle, so I'll talk to y'all later. Hey, what's up, bruh? What it do, bruh? Nah. Nah, hell nah. Y'all gotta go. Stop playing. Nobody playing, Pooh. You're not allowed back up in here. After what you pulled the other night. What are you talking about? Are you serious? Yeah, you came with a strap. Bri's battling tonight. Not in here. Reg, but I didn't even do nothing. Sorry, Bri. You and your crew got to get off the property, now. You got to go, Pooh. You real funny, Reg. Hey, y'all did that. Shame, Pooh. Come on, come on. I'm getting heated. Let's go. Bri, come on. I don't got time for this. Let's go. You better delete that. Let's go. Come on. Bri, come on. Bri! I'm not going. Come on, let's go. You're not about to embarrass me in front of all these people. Let's go. Hey, yo! Everybody listen up. Listen up, I'll battle anybody right now! Right now! Who want in? Who want in? I'll take it. Fake nails, eyes, hair and hell a fake-ass A walking Ms. Education I'm about to take to class All right. Coin toss, Megan the Mule. It's Ms. Tique. And I'll go first. Lil' Bitch. All right, y'all. First of all... I see that. How that make you feel, Bri? Mmm! She ain't lyin'. That's right. That's right. That was wild. Like, you came out the gate on some samurai shit. I mean, who wins a battle in a parking lot? In a lot? A parking lot! All right, so what now? What now is you gotta make a name for yourself. What do you mean, "a name"? I can't battle in parking lots forever. I need to make some money. I know. That's why I got you a connect at a studio. You got a connect? Since when? Since you beat Milez. My phone being blowing up off the hook. Yeah, they've been hitting me on IG too. Yeah, come on now. You about to be it. This is just the beginning. You about to pop off. Now just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride, all right? I got this. Trust me. How am I supposed to trust you when you got us kicked out the Ring messing with the King Crowns? Brianna. You knew that they came straight at me. You was about to pull out your gun. You saw that. Yeah, to protect us. Yeah, Bri, chill. I got this, Bri. I know what I'm doing. I ain't come up with it yesterday. Just relax. I got a plan. I got this. Jay. Jay! TREY: Hey! Mom's probably asleep. - What happened? - They cut the lights. I'll grab the candles and the flashlights. I'll call the company in the morning. We'll see if we can work something out. This all you? Man. Feel like I stepped into Narnia. Or like Annie with Daddy War bucks. Not that you're Daddy War bucks, because that'll be weird. There's nicer homes. Yeah, Jay and Bey's. Y'all got one of them TVs that come out of the floor? No. But we do got one that come down from the ceiling. Damn! Pop, what the hell is she doing here? Boy, if you don't act like you got some sense in my house. She beat you fair and square. What do you need to do is thank her for getting your streams up. Now squash whatever beef you got because Bri's family. Hey, look. I'm sorry about all that stuff I said about your dad, right. Law's a legend and I got nothing but respect for him. I ain't gonna lie, I wasn't prepared for you to come back at me as hard as you did. Yeah, you mad you got beat by a girl? A girl? Not dressed like that. Shut up. No, I'm playing. I don't care that you're a girl. I rock with female MCs. My play list is full of nothing but Nicki, Cardi, all of that. Yeah, but if you ain't got Hard Core, you ain't got nothing. Oh, yeah! Lil' Kim is the ultimate queen bee. Hands down.Right. I mean, she kicked in the door for Eve, Nicki, Meg, Cardi, everybody. Hard Corewas iconic from a visual standpoint, the aesthetic... Okay, get on up out of here, boy. Give me and Bri a minute to chat. Come on, shows top. So, you and Pooh got banned from the Ring? Yeah. Some bullshit. Battling. That was Pooh's plan? Let me guess. She saw that Infamous got a million dollar deal. So, she was going to keep throwing you in hoping you got one too? Come on, man. That's what half the neighborhood is doing right now. Everybody trying to use the Ring to get put on. But I'm going to be honest with you. If you're gonna make it, it's gonna take more than the Ring. Got to make music, shawty. That's what I told Infamous before I signed him. And look what it got him. The Ring didn't get him a deal. I mean, it got him some recognition, little attention, but... His music got him a deal. Same thing with your daddy. All it took was the right buzz. The right song. At the right time. Then, boom. He blew up. You got anything like that? Yeah, I have a bunch of songs. Let me see. Let me show you something. Dad looks so young. Wow. We both were. Seventeen and stupid. But hungry as hell. I remember the first time your dad played Runnin' Wildfor me. It was like... magic. He was talking about what life was really like in the Garden and that's what people connected to. Just wanted to be in his presence. Hell, we all did. He gave us hope. You can be that something good. If it wasn't for your daddy, I wouldn't have a career. So, I feel like it's my responsibility to make sure that you make it. I have a producer in ATL I'm going to set you up with. I'll take care of everything. Fly you out first class. You can even bring your friends. My aunt is kinda running things for me right now. Then why did you DM me? Because... I just... What do you want, Bri? Hmm? This. I want all of this. Then let's get it. You are all right, Scrappy. You know what? Thank you. With your Hallmark ass. What is Lil' Bri doing here? What's up, superstar? Hey, Scrap. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. Yo, can you hit up Moosey and tell him we'll be by a little bit later? Yeah. Thank you. What's up? Oh, um, The dude with the studio. I forgot to tell you. He gonna hit me up probably today or tomorrow. They cut the lights. What? They cut the lights because Jay hasn't found a job and... she's two months late. Baby girl. Don't even sweat it. I got you. What do you need? How much you need? A hundred... You know she's not going to take your money. Listen, all you gotta do is tell her you won it in the Ring. It's fine. You must not know how much this means to me. We about to be homeless. I got a lot on the line right now. Brianna, cut it out. I got a lot on the line too. How? How? I just do. This is not working for me. Wait, what? I need a manager that can make stuff happen. So you're gon' dip on me? I can't wait around for your "connect." You know, I got everything riding on this. This is all I got. You think I wanna be living up in these projects for the rest of my life? Slinging shit? Then stop! POOH: What are you talking about? It's not that simple, little girl. I'm shocked at you, man. We're family, Bri. Well, you don't know what you doing and I need guarantees. I got guarantees, Bri. Well, they are not good enough. Look, Supreme set up a recording session for me in Atlanta and I'm going to take it. I'm sorry, but I have to. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Don't be like that, Pooh. Say less. Yeah, okay, okay. Yeah, you see it. I know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's ya boy, Milez with a "Z" aka Mr. Swagerific. We just touched down and I got my pop, Supreme, with me, and of course, the Princess of the Garden herself, Lil' Law. Let's go! If you ever turn into that, I will completely disown you. If I do, you have my permission. Okay. Cool. Whoa! This is crazy. Supreme! Hey, let me make a record too. Let's check in. Act like you've been here before. I've literally never been here before. What? I ain't say nothing. Yeah, why are you looking at me like that? I think you funny. Goddamn, this room is nice! Oh, my God. Look, they got the fancy peanuts. Don't touch them. They cost money. Yeah, but it's not my money. Ah! This is so soft. All right, guys. I got a lot planned for this weekend, so settle in. And then, we'll get the dinner by the pool. "Settle in and then we'll do dinner by the pool." Don't mind if I do. Peace out. What? Oh, my God. Okay, who switched out my bestie for Normani? Shut up, Sonny. No, you look good, for real. Yeah.

Damn, I want that Good One word, one syllable If I could, I'd give everything I should to make my family good I'm coming back to the Ring in a couple of weeks for a live stream performance. I would love it if you and your guys came through as my VIPs. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm with that. And tonight, y'all rolling with me. Are you for real? Come on, man. For the Garden. We all set? Yes! Yes! What? Nothing, I'm just looking right now. You're being weird. I'm not being weird. What are you doing? You feel that? You a little skinny, but I guess. Nah, the beat. Listen. It's why I started rapping. When I was a kid, I used to sit in all my pop's studio sessions. When I put my hand on my chest, my heartbeat always matches the rhythm. Feel it now? Yeah, I feel it. Hey, baby. Hope you're having fun in Atlanta. And being safe. I love you. Call me back. Couldn't sleep? It's... a lot on my mind. You? Sonny's snoring like a broken car engine. I think there might be something actually wrong with him. How's Aunty Jay? She still hasn't found a job. You know, things are gonna get better, Breezy. Will it? What do you mean, "Will it?" Yeah, it will. I mean, look at you. Already stepping out, going to this big studio tomorrow. I mean, that's crazy. You know, you're doing it. I mean, regardless of everything that happened. Plus, you know, Long and Tate, they technically got suspendedl don't wanna talk about that right now. I bet I can make you smile in less than a minute. Why do you hate silence? No. No. Oh, my God. You hear them fans? There are no fans. "Malik! Malik!" No. Malik! No! What do you mean, "No"? No! I got bars. No, you don't.Yes, I do. No, you don't You're supposed to be my hype man Come on, hype me up. Oh, really? Yeah, really. Really? Really. I've been wanting to do that since the eighth grade. I've been wanting to do that since the fifth grade. You only like me now because I had on a nice City Girls dress. I mean, you looked good. Hey, but, do you remember Jamal Reeves? Ashy Jamal with the crooked teeth? Yes. Yes. Remember, it was one flag day during fifth grade. You had brought your light saber to school and he had threatened to take it away. But then, you said... And I quote... "I will use the force... "to choke you out." And he believed you. Yeah, I remember that. And that's when I was kinda like, "All right, I like-like this girl," you know. How come you never said anything? I don't know, because it's... the unholy trinity? You know, not the dynamic duo. I don't want to ruin our friendship. How about now? I thought you said this producer was a hit maker. This looks like a trap house. Doc one of the best in the game. This spot helps him keep his ears to the streets. My guy. Whaddup, Preme? What's up, Doc? This is Bri. The artist I was telling you about. Who's waiting to tear this track up that you made for her. All right. Hold up. You made that for this lil' girl? What she gon' do, spit some nursery rhymes? Yeah, don't worry about the beat. I'll handle that and leave the nursery rhymes to you, Hip-hop Harry. See what I'm saying? She's special. All right, we'll see. Time is money and I don't waste either. Check this track out. That go hard right there, nephew. All right.Yes. Booth is yours, baby girl. Okay. Yo, you got me missing my daughter's birthday for this? Song's not working for 'em. You said you liked the song. I do. I do. It's a decent track. But, uh... That's your audience out there. Doc, them dudes. If they ain't feeling it, nobody's going to listen to your record. Okay. What you need is... You need a different kind of edge. A sound that's raw. Hard. I mean, you got it in you. That rage. I saw it at the battle in the parking lot. That's not really... Do you know who the biggest consumers of hip-hop are? I don't know. White kids in the suburbs. And do you know what white kids in the suburbs love? Music that scares their parents. You gotta play that role, baby girl. Whatever that role is. Play a role? Look at me. I show up to these meetings with these execs, right? Expensive suit, tailored. Designer shoes that... cost what my mom used to make in a year. 'Cause I play the damn role. That's how we make this game work for us. We pimp them. Use whatever it is they think of us to our advantage. You're Lil' Law. Not Bri, not Brianna and contrary to what you think, that street stuff... sells. Look at Milez. Look at Infamous. Hell, look at your daddy. See, making hits. That's what I do. You kill this and you're going to be on the come up. The come up? On the come up. Yeah? Yeah. You got something for me? Yeah. Yeah, I got something. Okay. Well, let's cook. Think we good. Okay. All right. What the... Told you, man. They wanna call me a hoodlum? Fine, I'll be a goddamn hoodlum. Yeah.Damn. So? Damn, Bri. You killed that. Look, I did it all on the spot too. And Doc says he's gonna drop the song online tonight. See what the fans think and... Supreme says when we get back, we should record a music video.Wow. I have a song, Malik. My own song. I have a song. What's wrong? Nothing. I think it's dope. Don't lie, Malik. Like... What's up? No, I'm happy for you. You know, 'cause this is your big moment. You don't like this song? No, I do. I think the song goes hard. You know, I think the song goes so hard. It doesn't... really sound like you. What do you mean? I don't know. Like, the words and stuff, that's not you. I mean, but it is me though. I didn't have a ghost writer. No, that's not what I'm saying. I would not accuse you of having a ghost writer. I'm just... saying the lyrics about... guns and stuff. Those aren't things that you actually do. So? What do you mean, "So?" So rappers rap about stuff they don't do all the time. You think they out here, popping bottles and riding in Lambos? Oh, no, but that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying the words... That's not you. Bro, who cares? What do you mean, "Who cares?" We literally clown dudes like Milez who fake it just for some money. What are you talking about? At least they're getting money. Wow. That sounds like some real sellout talk. Are you calling me a sellout? I'm not calling you a sellout. I'm just saying... When you wake up in a cold apartment with no light, then you can come for me. There's the door. You can leave. So now you're going to kick me out? Yeah. That's real mature of you. Yeah, get out. Whatever, bro. Hi, everyone. My name is Jayda. And I'm a recovering addict. I don't come here as much as I should, as much as I used to. That's 'cause I've been feeling better. Much stronger. But lately, it's... It's been a rough couple of months. I lost my job. I had two interviews this week. They start off well. You know I'm a good talker. And, um... Then they ask about my gap of unemployment. I tell the truth. And all of a sudden, the way they look at me changes. And I can tell I'm just another junkie in their eyes. Then I don't hear back. My daughter... She's growing up so fast. And I pray... I pray that she grows up to be somebody she can be proud of. You know she don't even call me Mom? It's Jay. She hasn't called me Mom since she was five. And I don't blame her. Mom is a name that you got to earn, right? Home sweet home. Thank you for everything. Of course. It's just the beginning. Before I forget. What's this? Consider it an advance. I haven't made any money off the song. It's from me. I can't wait to get you back in the studio. You keep rapping like you did, I'll make that back and then some. This is too much. And you already done a lot. I owe you. No, you don't. I do. Thank you. I'mma tell Mom. I know that ain't Lil' Bit sneaking in past curfew. Ugh. Your hands are wet. Oh. Right. So I can't hug my little sister 'cause she "on the come up"? You heard my song? Heard it? What? Look at this. Uh-huh. Everybody heard it, Bri. Twenty thousand streams.20K. I keep wanting to slap myself like this isn't real. Oh, I can slap you. Try it. Is that my baby? Is that my baby? Hey. Hey. I got you something. What? What's this? Brianna. How did you... Supreme gave it to me. Oh, my God. Well, that's a lot. Supreme givin' you money like this. I'm not comfortable with that. Well, we need it. What the hell? What's going on? Have you lost your damn mind? What? What? I'm talking about the goddamn song, Bri. I'm driving over here and every fool that got a speaker's out there blasting this song, all up and down the street. What song? You don't even... Your daughter here, "Lil' Lawless", is talking about how she's a Disciple. She's spraying hollow tips and detaching crowns? What? It's just a song. No, it is not just a song. It's a statement. You're coming for King Crowns and they're gonna take you serious. I didn't come for nobody. I mean, the whole point of the song is about playing into the stereotype and I feel like anybody who... Let me tell you something. Fools are not gonna be looking for a deeper meaning, okay? If you gonna be bro lick and come at people, then you better be ready to step up your game and be gangster. It's just a song! Damn! And it's a hit. That's what rappers do. They front. You say what you gotta say to sell records. What? What in the world are you saying? I thought you would have been happy for me. You sound stupid. We made that song in a day. And that's more than I ever did working with you. Okay. So I guess you found your voice then? I'm going to bed! You better! Patricia. Patricia! You just gonna... leave. Come on. What the hell? Yo, Bri, On The Come Upis a banger. You snapped on that song, bruh. Appreciate it. When you two fight, it's like Captain America vs. Iron Man. And my ass is Peter Parker. I mean, you know, Peter Parker was technically on Iron Man's side. Not the point, Bri. Look, I'm sorry you're in the middle of this. But it is what it is. I'm not talking to Malik until he apologizes for calling me a sellout. Chile, the ghetto. I know y'all two kissed. I was gonna tell you. Yeah, he beat you to it. Doesn't matter 'cause it's not happening again. Straights keep making things complicated when it doesn't have to be. Did you know how hard it is to just be out free with a boy at this school? I'm not salty. I'm just... I'm just saying, don't make it complicated. Go to class! What's going on? We have called the police! Dude, what is happening? They're back. Who? Long and Tate. We've had enough of this. Break this up. Let's just get inside and get this thing over with. Bri, they not going to get away with what they did to you. Hell no. We will not tolerate this kind of behavior! Everyone should go to class! This is your final warning! They're gonna start a riot. Yeah, this would have never happened if you had used my video. Okay, but I already told you I don't want that. I'm sorry, this is better? All students must report to class. If you do not, you risk suspension. Obviously, if you do... Look out! Yeah, we need to go now. Come on. Who threw that? Get back here, who threw that? Are you okay? We were just standing outside trying to figure out what was going on and then a bunch of kids just started chanting that song. That song, violent in nature, includes attacks on law enforcement, and is said to be by local rapper Lil' Lawless, whose real name is Brianna Jackson. School Board member Mindy Pittman had this to say. I think a diverse body of voices is what makes H. McCoy so very special. But I personally petitioned to have that student expelled. This is what you and Pooh was fighting about last night. I can explain. I heard the song. Explain to me what you were thinking. Why would you say that stuff? Where's the gun you rapped about, huh? Show me. Tell me. They're taking it out of context. You said that stuff. There's no way to get around it. Would you listen to me instead of coming at me? One, check your tone. Two, I am listening. I've listened long enough to hear my child rapping like a thug. Jesus. That's it. I don't want you working with Supreme anymore. I don't want you rapping anymore. What? I refuse to stand by and let you end up like your daddy, you hear me? Look what playing a role got him. A bullet in his head. Well, that's not me. You damn right it's not 'cause you're gonna focus on school and you're gonna leave that mess alone. Do I make myself clear? Baby. I don't want you to grow up too fast. I did and it's not something that I can ever get back. I want you to enjoy your childhood as much as possible. What childhood? You already ruined it. Excuse me? Don't talk to me like that. I'm your mother. Since when? Look... I don't know if you remember, Jay, but you left. When things got hard, you left. I had to. And I had to look out for me and Trey. I'm not quitting music and I'm not going back to that school. What? Mom says school's holding assembly 'cause of you. Go away. So you're really not going to school? Why? So I can end up slinging pizzas like you? Yeah, no thanks. I'm good. Wow. I know working at Sal's sounds whack to you, but I didn't quit my Master's program to sit around here doing nothing. Look, Sal's is the best I can do without leaving you and Mom hard up. At least, I haven't turned into an asshole. What's up, baby girl? Hey, Supreme. Hype wants you on his show this Saturday. Wait, Hype wants me on Hot Hour? I told you, you a star, baby girl. And this is gonna put you in front of an even bigger audience. It's all happening. Stay tuned. I'll text you the deets. Okay. Look, if you're trying to come at me again... I'm not, all right? I just want to say that I'm sorry. For what? Calling me a sellout or blaming me for the riots? For not being your best friend when clearly that's what you needed. I'm sorry too. For what? For kicking you out. That did hurt a little bit. Yeah, I mean, you deserved it. Did I? Yeah, you did. You know what? Right here. I mean, yeah. Well, well. What the hell? Hold on now. If it ain't the Princess of the Garden. What's up? We don't want no problems, bro. Oh, yeah? Yeah. What was all that shit you was saying about removing Crowns? I ain't mean no disrespect. You scared now, princess? I'm not scared. Can't you all just let us go? What do you mean, "Let you go?" Oh, my God! Stop that shit! Stop! Leave him alone! Stop! Leave him alone. What? You crying now? Yeah, you scared? Ooh! Why? Scared cause that dyke bitch ain't here to protect you? Look at this drip. Let me get that chain. I can't. Look, do this shit the easy way or the hard way. Uh-huh. All right, now I'll go. Come see me. Hey, yo, Bri. Bri! Just keep walking. Okay. So you gon' keep moving even though you hear me talking to you? I'm 'bout sick and tired of this little attitude of yours. You walking around here like I ain't changed your diapers, lil' girl. Bri. Bri, what is wrong with you? Nothing. We good. Oh, you good? Bri, come on now. For real. I get it. You mad. It's okay. You not my favorite person right now neither. But at the end of the day, we family. So if something happened, you need to tell me. We got robbed. What? The King Crowns, they rolled up on us. They hurt you? They took Daddy's chain. I ain't want to give it up, but... They had guns. They pulled up on y'all with pistols? Yeah. Okay. Don't do nothing. Let me tell you something, little girl. This is serious and needs to be dealt with, all right? They took Law's chain. And they pulled guns on y'all. This is why I didn't want to say nothing! Yeah, but, baby, you did. Please, just leave it alone, Pooh. Please. Yeah, all right. I'll let it ride. You for real? I said I'll let it ride, right? Man. They lucky I love you. Get your asses home now. Ma! Ma! What happened? What's going on? What happened? Pooh is... Pooh was shot. Pooh was shot. Okay. It's okay, it's okay. I told her all that mess was gonna catch up with her. I told her. I know, I know, I know. Why is she handcuffed? She came in with the police. They said once she's able to be moved, they're gonna take her. To jail? How can you do that? Mmm. What up, Lil' Bit? Hey. How you doing? I've been better. I'm so sorry, Aunt Pooh. About the necklace and... No. Stop. I should have never made that song. I said stop. No, if I had just listened to you... Stop it. Damn it, Bri. Just stop. I don't wanna hear none of that. For real. Bri, I only got a little bit of time before these cops come in here and scoop me. So, listen. I earned this. What's about to happen to me, I earned it. And when your father passed, it messed me up. Bad. And... I could have left the gang. But I stayed active. And that's on me. You hear me? It's what I gotta live with. Not you. So, do not make it yours. Everything that I got going on in my life... I signed up for that and you did not. You know? That's why I got so heated. All for that song, man, because that's not you. 'Cause you got a gift. Do you hear? And you can make it. No! You gonna make it. You are gonna make it. Baby girl, you are better than all of us. What's that thing I be saying? How did that go? Come on, you know the words. You can't spell "Brilliant" without first spelling "Bri."...first spelling "Bri." Yeah, exactly. It's true. Do you, Bri. You hear me? Please. Do you. If it ain't right, it ain't DJ Hype. Welcome back to the Hot Hour, y'all. We got a very, very special guest in the house tonight. Now, if y'all know me, y'all know that my favorite rapper... is Lawless. Rest in peace to my man, Lawless. But I have the pleasure of having his beautiful baby girl in the studio. She's got one of the hottest songs on the air right now. The song is called On The Come Up. Now, everybody's talking about it. It's the number one requested song on the radio. Kids love it, they streaming it all the time on Pandora. Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together. In the studio, Lil' Law. Thank you. So, let's get to it, okay? All the controversy. Does it follow you around everyday like flies on shit? What do you mean? Okay, there was a petition filed against your song. They wanna ban On The Come Up. Because folks are saying it caused a riot at the school. Is it anti-police or whatever? What is it? Look, I don't know about all that. I mean, I made a hit record. Do you think... that your song... encouraged kids to riot? I mean, do you feel like half the stuff you play on here encourages violence? We talking about your song. Okay, but does that matter? Like... I feel like everybody was already upset about other stuff, and a song didn't really make anybody do anything. You gotta admit your lyrics are harsh. Now you talking about killing cops. I didn't say anything about killing cops. Well, these are your lyrics now. "Cops be on some dirty biz, "Disciples looking for the Judases." It's a metaphor. "Middle finger to the grave. "Hit it like a Glock, cock. "Aim it and let it spray." It's just talk. I like the song. But just the thought of a 16-year-old talking about killing cops. Carrying gats. Shooting people. Did it bother you when my dad rapped about stuff like that at 16? No.Okay. Well, I know girls that are 16, 17, 18, strapped up and they have to do foul stuff just to survive. So, that confirms, y'all. She's rolling with the GDs. I don't roll with the GDs. Okay, well, here's another one of your lyrics. "Make a hitman..." I know what I wrote. I don't need you telling me what I wrote. It's just a song. I didn't mean for it to be that deep. I don't want anybody to get mad, or hurt, or nothing. I was just trying to make some money like everybody else. You know, how come when I do it, it's such a problem? Ask your aunt. Fuck you! Ladies and gentlemen, we just confirmed she is a gangster. She just walked out of here, PMS. If it ain't right, it ain't DJ Hype. Bri, hold on. Bri, stop! Goddamn it! Now, I told you he was gonna push your buttons. That's what Hype does. I'm done with all this. All what? This. All this. Pooh's going to jail. Look, what happened to Pooh is rough. But that ain't got nothing to do with what we got planned, baby girl. I can't do this anymore. So you wanna quit? Ruin it before we get it? What Hype, what everybody saying about me. That's not me. Who in the hell cares who you are? You think your daddy was hard? Law wasn't no damn gangster. When I met him, he was barely out of the church choir. Working some ol' raggedy-ass job. I'm the reason he started rapping that street shit. And I'm the reason that he started repping GD to look authentic. Get out your feelings and let's get this money. You were supposed to be his family. I am his family. Bri, listen to me, okay? I'm just trying to help you. Baby girl, don't walk away. You walk away and all this is gone. You ain't gonna be nothing! Hey. When you didn't come home, I knew I'd find you here. You okay? Should have never started rapping. I should have just stayed a nobody and none of this would have happened. You're not a nobody. You hear me? You're not a nobody. You are my child. You are everything. When you were little, you used to turn everything into a microphone. You know that? If I couldn't find my hairbrush, I knew you were babbling into it somewhere. Your daddy would say, "Our lil' miracle gon' be a superstar." Everybody just wants me to be like Dad. You don't have to be. You just be you. That's all the special you need. Bri. What I did, leaving you and Trey... That was the hardest thing I've ever done. I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry, baby. I know that broke you. I know. And maybe I can't undo the hurt. But I can promise you that I am never going away again. You and your brother are my life. You hear me? I love you, baby. Like everyone, I saw the video of the incident last week and I was appalled. These kids used a vulgar, violent song to taunt two gentlemen who were simply doing their jobs. Typical. We cannot allow our children to be exposed to such derogatory content. So, I signed the petition to have that student expelled and I just encourage other parents to do the same. Right. Thank you, Mrs. Pittman. Superintendent Cook. Jayda Jackson. It's a pleasure to finally speak to you. I was told by Principal Rhodes you'd be calling, but that never happened.Mom. My apologies... My daughter, a 16-year-old child, was physically assaulted by Officers Long and Tate last month. Wanna know why? 'Cause she sold candy. Not drugs. Candy. While some of us are afraid of the impact songs will have on our children, there are parents here who are absolutely terrified for the safety of their children at the hands of people who are supposed to protect them. The message we're getting is is that the safety of some of these kids is not as important as the safety of others. Let them know! Stand up. You okay with this? Yeah. This is Brianna. My baby. I want you to look at her. Really look at her. She's 16. Not a grown woman. Not a threat. A child. Do you know how I felt when I was told two grown men manhandled my child? As a mother, what am I supposed to do? As a superintendent, what are you going to do? The first thing would be to review the re-in statements of Officers Long and Tate. I promise to make that a priority. That's a start. For real, I heard people say, "Jayda Jackson for president." I'm being so serious. For real? Whoa, Milez, what are you doing? Hi. Whoa! Hold on! Back it up, reverse, rewind. Okay, okay. When did this happen? Can you guys pick your mouths up off the floor? I'm sorry. When did you two... Atlanta. You've been keeping this from me since Atlanta? Bro, you've been a little pre-occupied. Does your dad know? Yeah, he knows. He just chooses to ignore. Truth is, Miles with a "S" has always been this guy. Milez with a "Z" is supposed to be, you know... Teen heartthrob that all the girls love. I get that. Yo, he's been so pissed since you dropped him. Keeps blasting Drake, dude's going through it, it's bad. You know. So, what's the plan now? I guess I'll just be a one-hit wonder. Man. That's too bad. You one of the coldest rappers I know. I thought you knew that too. Man, I could go get some food. I don't know about y'all. Me too! I'll drive, I'll drive. One-hit wonders in the back. You look so good. Yeah, we just happy you out of the house, Mom. Yeah, it's about time. Only my baby could get me back into this Ring. Yo, look at all these people. You know Dad used to draw crowds bigger than this, right? This is crazy. Sorry I've been an asshole. Ain't like anything's ever gonna change. Shut up, I said sorry. And now, give it up for Infamous Millz. Yo! Whaddup, East Side? Man, it feels so good to be back home, baby. Now, I don't know if y'all know, but I ain't battled in a minute. But I need y'all to know a nigga still got it. I said I know a nigga still got it. Okay. Well... Matter of fact, it seems like I... just might be doing some battling tonight. Just got a word that we got a special guest in the building tonight. The Princess of the Garden. The Come Up Queen herself. Lil' Law. What is he trying to pull? He's trying to call me out. So, what is it going to be, Lil' Law? You ready for this smoke or nah? You don't have to do this. You know that, right? Yeah, forget them. You don't have anything to prove to anybody. Let's get this party started. Hype, where you at? This is the goddamn Battle Olympics. But tonight, we're gonna do three rounds. Winner takes all. You got this, Bri. Go, Brianna! Yeah, Breezy. On my right, we got the phenom. Garden Heights legend. Give it up for the Infamous Millz. And on my left, we got the heir to the Lawless throne. Give it up for Lil' Law. Let's get this started. You call it. Tails. It's tails. Let's go. Oh, that's what I'm talking about. I ain't even gonna ask. But round one was clearly Infamous Millz. Now, round two. "On her momma's arm." Yeah, like I ain't heard that a million times. Predictable. Very predictable. Okay. Predictable. All right, Bri. Yeah, I heard that one before. Oh, oh, oh, oh! That was feisty. Okay, Garden Heights. And for the winner of the second round... Yeah! Mmm! Damn right. Come on, Bri. Yes! Yes, Bri!
