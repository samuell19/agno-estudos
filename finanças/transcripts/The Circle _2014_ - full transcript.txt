" The card had a different library color each time. You had your name up, only numbers. The magazine was sent to neutral folder. Some came to the Circle only to read their magazine in a safe place. The Circle had about 2000 subscribers, and 700 from abroad. Approximately 4 people read each copy, always hidden. "Autumn dance". Before issued magazine had to pass censorship.

And what is your nature? - Definitely not like yours. - Oh la la! Felix jealous eh? Cheers! Dear friends. The Ladies and special ladies. From the time of the War Cycle It has created a network of friends. We all share the same wonderful dream. Our friendship, our love and freedom to live. Since, thanks to our many sister organizations were founded in France, Germany, Scandinavia, even in America, in Los Angeles. , Rolf was internationally known as the founder of the Circle. It was the ideal person. He had more integrity than any man I have ever known. He was only 21 years old when he began to study acting. . And he was successful. He went to Germany to work as an actor and came into conflict with the famous paragraph 175. In Germany homosexuality was a criminal offense. In 1933, when Hitler became Chancellor of the Reich immediately returned to Switzerland. In 1934 he opened the cabaret The Gherkins and worked there with them from beginning. , Rolf was an amazing director, so passionate. I learned a lot from him. He was always so polite, both friendly and incredibly fair. An amazing personality. In 1957, when the Circle celebrated its 25th anniversary , 800 people came from all over Europe, even and from America. These were the only mega gay event worldwide. The men talk about faith With only makes me laugh Love is eternally new. While faith is a test. That yesterday was mine, today is already past. Blessed is the love and wine. Faith is not to entertain. I do not know to whom I belong, I'm too good for just one ... If I was always faithful to you ... Oh !. Who is she? - It is him. - Kidding. ... Why only one to have enjoy such beauty ... She is woman. You bet; Oposdipote.Ekato francs. Are you crazy. Are you sure; ... I think I belong to myself. Simply Marvelous. Robi, were just perfect. Champagne, fast. I am dying of thirst. Do I know the Ernst. - My God, I'm ready to fall apart. - Congratulations, it was amazing. Congratulations, baby. You are the best. We can kidnap for a minute? Such plasma should get our album! A hundred francs was a lot of money. I earned 650 francs a month. I lost the bet, obviously. But who cares about that. This was the best investment I ever did. I had seen Ernst. I had noticed that sitting at the table. There were many there and I inoun still dazed by unharmed. Then I realized that the Robi was everywhere. Everybody knew him, He was the star of the Circle. I thought I would have no chance. I could not get close to him just like that. Ernst. Take my pipe. Mr. Ostertag. Mr. Ostertag. Meanwhile I read Camus. Impressive. Modern. Amazing book. However, I advise you not to use. Once certified will be different. - I just wanted to know. - Thanks. By the way, last Saturday I was bowling. - Can I count on you so. - Yes. - And you me. - Thanks. The Sunday evening was the Circle second meeting. And I was invited and I thought that if Robi will be there, I will go twice. I went a little late and they were all already there. There was only one chair empty and it was away from Robi. I thought, do something to attract his attention. I tried to start a conversation and noticed that he listened. The only thing I could do It was to invite the whole group My home next Sunday. They came all - apart from Robi. He did not come. My plan failed. I did not go because My uncle from Germany He called me and said, that came to Zurich. So my sister and I had To accompany our relatives. I could not apologize by Ernst because I did not know his name or the left. Fortunately, someone knew working the Robi. Robert, you can start cleaning. Make the floor. - I think we have a customer. - Really? - Good evening. - Good evening. I would like to mow. Gladly. - Good evening. - Good evening. To do as I want? I knew that my boss - who also was from Germany - He says bad things about me to the authorities. He told me not to give citizenship because I am curious person. Where are we going; It is surprising. Nobody has ever gotten from work ... Do not worry, no one will bite. - Hi to all. Hello. Hello. What kind of child we have here? Su, this is Ernst. What you drink; - How about a syrup? - Yes please. Syrup? Are you crazy? We are not the Salvation Army. Two beers. I heard that you are a teacher. And you're a bachelor. And I am. What bachelor? Teacher. Nonsense, a doorman at Swissair, you are. And even rookie. Cheers. Hey listen .. You can sell your ass where You want, but not here. Understand; Chasou. Immediately, or I'll call the police. Swiss. Immediately the police, police. Universities fuck off. Outside! Damn. When he arrived in Zurich I thought this is the most liberal city ​​in the world . There was a lot of fun. incredibly lively, or even suspected to defend yourself or hide in some way. Not at all. You could go to Barfojser or Niederdorf. These were our parts ... They were all there. Lesbians ahead, gay people back, And sometimes the opposite course. It was a classic haunt, classic place for gay entertainment. Do not forget that Switzerland has never had Section 175. Homosexuality between adult was not a criminal offense. This played an important role in be Zurich attractive. In Germany paragraph 175 lasted much longer. Young Germans came Friday night and stayed until Sunday, to make up for lost time. I heard that Lufthansa had a flight Friday evening from Frankfurt to Zurich which called the "Queen of Hansa Express". This turned Zurich into a cosmopolitan, modern, sophisticated city. Made you feel that you are not somewhere in the hinterland, but almost with one foot in New York. Oh, Those You've read all this? Nearly all. Why do you ask? Just wondering. We do not know each other well. What about Emil; Long wanted to divide. What happens; - I have to go home. - What; In my mom. Can not sleep until I get back home. Are you kidding me! Believe me. Will you come tommorow for breakfast; Make peace leaving. Hen! See you soon. My parents came to Switzerland 1927 I was born in 1930 I had a wonderful, carefree childhood until February 1937, when my father died. And then we were alone. At that time there was a widow's pension, especially for foreigners. So my mother had to support itself, my sister and me. She did the housework a day, - Cleaning, washing, ironing - and evening working on a theater. Fresh coffee for my beautiful sleeping beauty. What a surprise. - Good morning. - Good morning. Come in. Good morning. - Good morning. - Ernst, this is my mom. Mom, this is the Ernst. - Ernst. - He dared to enter the cage of lions. Welcome, Ernst. Thank you. Chic, do not you think? This will be the new dress my unharmed. Shows great. Brown, Ernst; You will stay for breakfast, is not it? Yes, it will stay. And then we'll go for a walk, right? Me, Robbie told how he grew up, Almost asleep in school Why they had to deliver bread early in the morning. And after school had to go to rehearsals and shows up late. For the family was not a problem how Robbie was gay. So I did and I problem. Obviously they knew what happens between us. Something that was not the case in my own family. Of course I was dying of curiosity for his family Ostertag. It was a cultured family, wealthy, affluent. Absolutely "First Class" relative to us. I definitely know his parents. But, Ernst said, forget it. It will take 10 years. - Good morning. - Hello. Wow. A fag killed. Stabbed to death. Oboosier, I think it was famous composer. I have not heard. Jesus. I was in concert. Homosexuals are homosexual. You know how to put four of them a chair; Yeah, turns her upside down. Only you think that the do with each other ... Mr Otley! He was completely hidden. He believed did not fit in his capacity as a musician. Thank you. - Sugar. - Yes please. I do not know him. There was a member of the Circle. Oh my God. They stabbed in the back, many times, hit him with one stone in the back of the head. Who could do this? Maybe he's the killer. Our trial results in your community. Mr. Stamm. I really want to help. You know that we do not to do with such people. But you could possibly tell me to start looking. You know you better savings too. Mr Meyer, Could you please have the your ears open in the cycle? Your advantage and you solved this case as soon as possible. We all knew about the murder but when we found it someone who was related to the gay scene that was a prostitute, really shocked. We thought, oh my God, What happens now? Recluse, who escaped from the Correctional Institution. Unbelievable. At least they caught him. The case is now closed. No, it's just the beginning. Listen to this: Also responsible Homosexuality scene in Zurich. In a week they will all be forgotten. 436 00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:32,060 In the apartment the Oboosier forced the in abominable sexual practices. Rolfe, with Felix is ​​right: ¨ Zurich became a sexual Mecca of homosexual and attracts pornous. Nursery omofylofilias. As if each issued is killer! Of course not, but a problem. You know what I think about it. There are all in both good hands like you. Rolfe, I will write a letter the author. - A good review. - Nonsense. We have our magazine, this is our weapon. It is much more effective write something there. Oh, Rolfe, who reads our magazine? Nobody, except us, nobody. Sorry. Interrupting something? Not at all. I realized that I want to contribute, stonKyklona help in this situation. In my beginning simply yielding office work to do but gradually I began to do the author's work. The magazine was trilingual and we knew that the French censored, but nobody knew English. So there were some very spicy texts in the English part. No porn, but very close. When translated into German delete parts or amend and we more conservatively. , Rolf knew what are we doing. Because he did not know English. Besides, it was not his style. And Rolf especially did not like the word "Homosexuality." He wanted to use the word "homoerotic": I explained that this was related only to sexuality, while homosexuality with eroticism in general, not only about sexuality. He thought he could to live with her partner and be faithful thyself. I realized how different was my experience of sexuality compared with the way gay people My friends the experienced. At that time the gay community It was very patchy. And it was much more than one subculture. More overnight, about indiscriminately. This bothered me a little. I was wondering how can one have such deep feelings of friendship and simultaneously, sexual life, love of life be so incredibly confused and chaotic. Give me another twenty. We had agreed that. Give me more. Hey! You passed and thou beautiful! Old sister. Hey! All OK! Slowly. Can I? Of course. For playing Snow White. Ever wanted female roles. Queen Elizabeth, Iphigenia. I did not like it. I imagine it. Where is, though? He would go to the bakery. Will return. Once the Leopold Lindbreg He came and told me: You have a son. Why did not you send to me to see him? They are looking for a boy to play in the film "Das Menschlein Matias." And the little she got the role. What cute boy. He wanted so much to see this father. His father was also a child who exploit, exactly as in role playing here Robi ... What happens; The Gian ... The Gian is dead. What Worker killed by Swissair. Oh my God. He was your familiar? Yes. We were completely shocked. Then came a sickening article about an organization called "Circle". We were involved in this. "Large parties and fancy dances." There is no doubt that all sex workers They rushed here from all over Europe to shop with members of the Circle Main Station and get them to their dances together. It was the worst deliberate slander. One idiot with a big mouth spreads this news. We must be more careful. And public Rolfe; What are we going to do public? - It's time to make a clear statement. - Exactly. Where no one would publish it. Must. I will take care of it. There "should" do anything. We must take action, a protest march. That would ruin everything. Everything we have achieved. Rolfe, though, Felix wants to do as an individual? It is imperative not to create more noise. That was our tactic in the war and he worked. You and your skatopolemos. The war is over. Felix. Felix. But so it is! The Circle is my home. And not going to ruin. It's your house, but for me they're prison. Felix, stop. The Gian is dead. To oppose him would not bring back. The police found the murderer very fast. Even before the trial the press wrote about a poor boy, a minor molested by bad motherfucker which forced him to do disgusting things. They turn the criminal into a victim and the victim in criminal. The judge was so forgiving so that the killer left the court free. . The press wrote about "Triumph of Humanity". The verdict was a disaster. He was acquitted because it was that was forced. The verdict was clear. Just release him. Unbelievable. That was what shocked us more. I gave evidence to the police which led to the killer. Now I'm in newspapers with my name. While swore to protect My privacy. Rolfe. No Information the cops now. Absolutely nothing. If someone wants to do something meaningful the latest version should be transferred from the German border. What happened to him which carried in Germany; Arrested and beans in prison. Damn. The "Circle" has been banned again in Germany, is not it? Do you think this will work? our metafooreas always did when it passed the border. Besides once at Kreuzlingen. Then he caught him. Why can not people live just the way you want? Love the way you want and marry in the way he wants. Man or woman. To get married; I do not mean that. Equal rights for all. This is my communism. Good morning. Your identity, please. Good morning. Do you have anything to declare No, just do a little getaway. Okay ... Farewell, then. - Thanks. - A moment! Open your bags. Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop. Stop telling you. Catch them. I do not understand. By Felix citiless! I'll say that not become. , Felix is ​​not stupid. - He said he guarded the passage. - Great! The German carrier arrested. Is not that enough? I believe that, Ernst He was very brave, really. I remember were saving lives during the war. Rowing on Lake Constance. But what he did, Ernst was not bravery. This plan was stupid. Stupid? This kind of stupidity saved many lives. You can not compare these two mom. Why not; Passes smuggled magazines in Germany, as a teacher Who lives need to save? Ernste; Tell me was nothing else? - The readers' list of the "Circle"; - Yes. Do not ask me that. It's impossible. Now we have a third murder in our hands. Which has nothing to do cycle. The carrier who was arrested in Germany He admitted he was taking magazine from Zurich. Of course, from our offices. And you know it. These two things do not They have nothing in common. Mr Mayer, I appreciate your dedication. But this time should be business with us. No. Well, I'm afraid, will You should not force you. Homosexuality is not illegal in our country. - Have you forgotten? - No. But we can include it. I believe ... I think that will never become the right companion for you. Robi. You're so smart. Do you speak foreign languages, You got travel. Well, do something about it. You can travel and learn foreign languages. You can do many things and it is always important. I would like it too. I do my own thing. My own lyrics, my own songs, mine unharmed. I am with you, Ernst. Forever. To live a normal life with you. You will never understand me, right? Robi, is there anything else? Simply I can not be so comfortable with it like you. I envy. What In Felix; You have no reason to envy. No matter. I imagine together. I could imagine even that we have the same lover. Oh! you could do that! When would you imagine me RECOMMENDED Your parents? I could not understand why no o Ernst take me home to meet his parents. This lasted almost two years. - Oh no, a few months. - No, no, at least 1 year. as invite me coffee one Saturday afternoon. Mom? Dad? - Good evening. - Good evening, Ernst. - Hi Dad. - Good evening Ernst. - Hi Mom. - How are you? For the lady of the house. Sit. Nice to see you again. - How are you; - I'm fine. - Mother, the flowers, not ... - Would frontiso. Kristina, you come? Well ... mother, father, this is The Robi Rapp. You colleague of my son, as the young girl, that was its name? Gaby Gerster. - Not me .. - Studying together. - No, I am a hairdresser. - Truth; Well, we need one. Cristina! - Good evening. - Hello. Let's begin. - Would you like coffee? - Yes please. - Can I? - Yes. Ernst, have weakened. Not you eat? Nobody ever told me what was happening. I assumed that he was a good friend and that they have an intimate relationship. Of course it seemed to be somewhat different, but I would ask ... Us, Ernst was hiding. Invented stories girls so we thought that with some thing was happening. Now he says it was all about coverage. If she ever said anything physical contact or sexuality I would categorically say, I'm asexual. My parents had once said that sexual development It passes through many stages. According to my father Becoming man sometime and create family and assume responsibility. If you do not do this, then you do not deserve anything. My mother threw oil on the fire saying that people who do not grow remaining infants. Maimed emotionally. That really hurt. It was really almost worse than me to reject. Hi to all. Look at this. Plaka do? The Admin has decided that it will not regaining dances gays on his property. This is the police command. You should cancel the Autumn dance. - What was that; - What; You could do dance to me. It is a bit small but your style. Better than nothing. My show. - No thanks. - Why not? I want to sing. We're not good enough refined their masters? Su, we'll do it gladly here. I said no. The dance was canceled. It is very dangerous. Rolfe, you talk to the manager? You do not understand; He said no. You're courageous. The rest does not come anymore. Are raids almost every day. You think I do not know? Quickly. - There could be a few more. - What; It's a little professor in thyleon school. 716 01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,080 I warn you, talk to anyone! How went bowling? Well, I did 2 strike. The children; Well, they went to bed for hour. Well. -Kalinychta. - Also. I have a bad feeling. You are not afraid; As I am not afraid to tell mom I have my friend. I did not choose my parents. They do not want to takousoun. You do not understand; And I'm dying to go out on stage. The song is not prohibited. Here you are. You said you want to do something yours. There are some poems that I've written. Maybe you can do something with them. "I'm so weird, oh I'm so weird." Ernst, you must come, you just have to come! - It is very dangerous. - Will you come! If you love me, you will come. Everything started to collapse. There were threats. They said they know where we will be and will break us. Would send thugs groups. Our friends were beaten. Everyone was scared. Mr. Ostertag, thought let me ask you... a French troupe comes to Zurich. Perhaps I'd like to go together, just the two of us I did not know ... I think that would be wonderful. What do you think; Or would you rather ... - Oh, Inspector. Good luck. - Thanks. Good evening. "Alas, who knows where my future leads Love made me look, 755 01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,480 But who knows what the My destiny And if waiting for life or Death. " In thanks. Who can tell us what he was talking about the "Andromache" of Jean Racine? Madeleine. - For a desperate love, - Exactly. What do you do when you love and love is not mutual? Verena. I do not know, maybe I did something to myself. Really? Ursula; I definitely do not. I was playing for my love. Good. Break. Mr. Ostertag. I'll let you know. - Have a nice day. - Goodbye. Well, to play now? Will not come; Afraid. Oh, come on, Robbie. What's up; Nobody dancing? Jean Martin, with you, always! What are you doing here; I came to support dance. Close the music !! Close !! There will be unharmed tonight. But nevertheless I will sing. For all of us. Cycle. But above all for Ernst, my boyfriend. My name Modd and I love rare plants which grow only south of the equator Sometimes I want to play with myself I've never fallen in love with a man. I am so rare, Oh, I am so rare, so that I can even say If I am still alive or simply dreaming. I think I am almost a teddy bear. I am a foreign woman on the porch. Police. Baumgartner. We have notified how dances are prohibited. We will check your papers. Stand all in a row with your hand in hand. Quiet! Silence! Nobody leaves until to check his identity. Already have them checked before three weeks. Damn. Quickly, bring him Robby here, to help him escape. Those without papers will be transported the police station. Come on, Ernst, fast, from the bathroom window. Robbie! Think about your work. This is your only chance. The Robi, for God's sake? Where is Robbie; If you get caught, to deny everything. Bastards. What happened during the raid is incredible. They xeftilisan them. They take off their clothes and their They left naked in public, and psaxane their genitals latex gloves. He had to set up on a chair and to bend They look with a flashlight to see if you have lice, to humiliate in. And if you did not have identity takes you the police station. "Dear strange boy." What is the M .; Call me now. - I do not know. - Stop the stupid. Tell me. Come on, I want names. - You go with sex workers? - Of course not. Are you sure; And Ernst Ostertag; And he issued no?

Are; Then please get Halkidiki in Section am to sign a statement. I can not do it. Works. We all day there. Goodbye. He was shaking with rage and I was afraid. When I went to the police station, People stood on the steps, some of the circles, and others known They stood like sheep for slaughter. Everyone was moody and realized that had been launched some severe punishment. So you want to become a teacher. Yes. Configurator man ... indeed. I see here that you have not yet been certified. Mr. Ostertag, please take a look at these photos, This will be confidential, of course. He, for example. I do not know him. And him? Strange. He says it's your boy. And you do not know? What happens; What have I done; Surely you know that the third murder gay has not surprisingly elusive. Then I said: I am suspect murder? The question infuriated him. He made a nod to police who stood behind me He grabbed my hands backwards and They pulled me abruptly. This was done very quickly and it hurts me a lot, and cried. Then one of them hit me on the chin. He stuck me head against the wall and do not let me move. Something like that. Then they told me that if it was create problems They were kept for 24 hours. They will ring up at school in the morning and will explain why I did not go. I realized that the police with blackmailing. They said that they will take my fingerprints And when I refused They stuck me to the wall again. - You prefer to wait outside? - No. I said I'll stay with you. So you say that you have homosexual tendencies and do not recognize any of them. This is the third time that you ask. - Romy is okay. - No, it's okay. You can not treat us so sir.
