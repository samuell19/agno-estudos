Tina, baby. You are so beautiful. I know who you are. You're with the demons. And I detest spies. Take her to the guesthouse! Enjoy your stay! Scumbag! Tuck her in, boys! Announcer: It's time for what's cooking tonight? And here are your hosts, Melbourne's favorite chefs, baggio and Jackie! Thank you. Thank you. Tonight we combine the culinary arts of the east and the west. Ooh! Easy there, Jackie. Baggio: First, knead the dough. It's like giving your true love a sensuous massage. Then stretch the dough and give it a twist. Crowd: Ohh! Ladies, if you want, after the show, Jackie will do the same to your hair. - Ah. - Ohh. Baggio: Now pull the dough into fine spaghetti noodles. The alchemist works his magic, and before your very eyes, a lump of dough is transformed into delicious pasta! For this bitch you betray me? I1... 1 just... How much did they pay you? Nothing. I was drunk. I didn't know she was a demon. Some punk stole my coke because you couldn't control yourself? I'll get it back. I swear. Oh! No! Boss, the demons are here! I hear you have something that belongs to me. I don't think so! Slut. You set me up. Careful! I'm really good at cutting things off. Excuse me. I thought we're here to do some business. Put 'em away. Okay... Mr. Giancarlo, let's deal, huh? Here's half a million. You give me back what's mine, I'll let you walk away, no questions asked. Half a million, huh? How much do you want? Giancarlo: All of it. Ah-ah-ah... All of it, 10 million. What's the world coming to when a businessman has to pay to buy back his own stuff?! Your stuff, huh? Only stuff I got is mine! You want it?

Man on machine: It's Jeremy from channel 13. Well, where's your exclusive? Call me. Woman on machine: Hi, it's Annie at global. Heard you got a hot story. We can definitely do better than those cheap bastards at 13. - Hi. - Hi, lakeisha. - Grandpa! - Grandpa! Hi, Sonny. Hi, Nancy. - Ahh. - Dad... How are you? I'm still kicking. Jackie: Open the door, please! Hi. Baggio: Hey, Jackie. Hi, everybody. - Hi. - Hey. Hi, Sonny and Nancy. Whoo! Hey, Jackie, you're looking sharp, man. Sharp? I'm lucky to be here. Why? I was shopping, and I was shot at by the gangsters. Oh, my god. Jackie: They were chasing a woman. They thought she was with me. Was anybody hurt? No. My poor car is full of holes. Where'd this happen, downtown? - It did. - Who was this woman? Her name's Diana. Oh, she said to watch the big story tonight. You know, I should take this down soi can file a report. Put that away. You're off duty. I don't want to talk about it now. For this bitch you betray me? This is so cool! I wanna watch the cartoons. Hey! Grandpa! Grandpa! Sonny's pushing me! Ah, come on! Be nice to your little sister, don't fight. Come on, we'll go and watch Jackie cook dinner. - Yeah! - Yes? Announcer: On what's cooking tonight oh, my god. Baggio: First, knead the dough. It's like giving your true love a sensuous massage. Then... Who is it? It's Richard. Richard? Sorry. I... Baggio: Now pull the dough into fine spaghetti... Hold it. This ain't the tape. Where's the tape? I don't know. Maybe this will refresh your memory. Wait! Wait. It's-it's with that guy. What guy? The guy who saved me. Let's go! Don't do that again, bitch! Don't try anything stupid. Whatever you say. Sorry. Sorry? You trying to get a cheap thrill? What? Don't stand there acting innocent. Did you get a good feel? Hey! That's ok. You can go. Move it. Don't push me! That guy's trying to cop a feel. Hurry it up! What's the hurry? You men are all the same. You can't wait, can you? Can't wait to see what you've paid for. No worries, mate. Oh, what's this? A gun? Ooh! Kinky! Out of my way! Man: You idiot! Come on. Get up. Come on, this way. They've gone. - Where's the phone? - Over there. Lakeisha: I can't wait to see what's on the big story tonight. What do you think of Jackie's new recipes? Mmm. Delicious. Hey, you never say that about my cooking. Dad, I've been eating your cooking for 30 years, okay? My marriage only lasted five. Hmm? So you think in a marriage, food is more important than love? Well, that's the way it is. If he had taken my advice and become a chef, she wouldn't have left him. Grandpa, you always say being a chef is the best. Yeah, and that being a cop is too dangerous. And the kitchen is a safe place. That's right. That's why Jackie's not a cop. That's true. Jackie's dad and I were best friends. We owned a restaurant together. And before he died, I promised I would take care of Jackie and keep him out of danger. So, as long as I'm around, Jackie's going to be a chef, not a cop. Well, that's too bad you and Jackie's dad didn't bother asking him. And it's too bad that my own son doesn't listen to me the way Jackie does. I think I go get dessert. Dad? Can I be anything I want to when I grow up? We'll talk about that when you get older. Newscaster: Tomorrow, more sunshine and slightly warmer temperatures. Strange. The big story is not on tonight. So where's your mystery woman? I don't know. What are you doing tomorrow morning? I'm taking a load of videos to the show. Why, what do you want? Can you take me to the airport? Oh, come on. Okay. Have I ever turned you down? Thank you. Sonny, Nancy! Come on. We're going! Sonny, we're leaving! Come on! C'mon, Sonny! We're leaving! He's dead. Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Oh, I'm gonna kill that bastard! He's gonna pay for this. Murdered grank, Tina's missing. Giancarlo, you're a dead man. I'll teach you to screw with the demons. Mm-hmm. I'm gonna shove these up Giancarlo's ass. I'm gonna kill them all! Shut up! Or you'll get us all killed. Bitch. Look at you. Who do you wanna kill, me or Giancarlo? I want him dead, we all want him dead. But we've gotta find a way to get to him. Then we wait for the right moment and then we kill the bastard! How long is she staying? I don't know. If she likes it, she may stay longer. Are you going to marry her? Maybe. Well, do you love her? Of course. How do you feel about me? I like you. We've been together a long time. How come you never asked me out on a date? We work together, we eat together. That's enough. What's wrong with you? You know what's wrong. I do? Miki. - What? - Jackie! Miki! This is my assistant, lakeisha. Nice to meet you. Hl there. You speak mandarin? Great! What'd you say? Huh? She only speaks a little. Let's go. I'm so excited. Lakeisha on P.A.: Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for everyone's favorite culinary cut-ups, baggio and Jackie! Welcome to the 10th annual "feed the hungry" benefit. Thank you for opening your hearts... And your wallets... To help the needy. You eat today so that they can eat tomorrow. Baggio: Mmm. Jackie, I smell money out there. After the show, stop by and purchase your personally autographed cooking with baggio and Jackie video. And, of course, all of our proceeds go directly to "feed the hungry." Anybody hungry? You. Baggio: Sit. Relax. Open wide! Ah! Over here, Jackie. Here we go. It's really good! Ah, Jackie. Miki. Careful. Don't get egg on your face. Ah. Up here, Jackie. Incoming! Me! Me!

Videotape. Wait! Thief! I'm gonna split your skull. Wait. I can explain. You can explain it to the cops. I'm not a thief! I'm looking for something that belongs to me. Uh-huh. I got it right here. It's okay if your suitcase is lost. As long as you're okay. You're still shaking. I thought we were going to die back there. Why are they so angry with you? What did you do? I didn't do anything! It's just one big misunderstanding. Diana: Enough, you psycho! Stop! Stop! You're trashing my place! It's not my fault. She's doing the trashing. And now I'm going to trash your butt! Wait! Ow! Ow! Stop it! Look at my place! How could you do this to me after I saved your life? I'm sorry. Look, I dropped a videotape in your car yesterday, and I have to get it back. That must be the video the gangsters wanted. You didn't give it to them, did you? No! Good. Just give it to me. I don't have it. - What? - What? You have to, because when I got home, I had one of your stupid cooking videos. Stupid? I'm sorry, I can't help you. Please. I've got to have that tape. I'll do anything. I'll bet you will. What do you mean, do anything? Not what you think. If I had the tape, I would give it to you. You should go to the police. I'd be happy to take her. Please just go. You don't understand... I understand. I know. My vase? Oh. Sorry. It's ok. I can fix it. Jackie, if you could just help me. You're my last hope... This happens often? Only occasionally. Occasionally? She's gone out of our lives. They're coming. They're gonna kill me. What? You're right. Is there another way out? Yes. Follow me. Jackie: Every time I see you, trouble. This way. Lakeisha: Wait. Be careful. Diana: Wait. Wait for me. That's the way out? Yes. Don't worry. I'll go first. This is the other way out? Yeah. Are you scared? No. Sorry. - Go. - Diana: I'll go. Ok. Shit! - Shit. Shit. - Ow! - Ow. What?! - Nothing, nothing. Okay. Shit, shit... - Need any help? - No. - Okay. See you later. - Okay. Hey. Why did you stop? I'm afraid of heights! - Why didn't you tell me before? - I just found out! Come on! Listen. Look straight. Now what? Close your eyes. Now what? Ay-yow! - Ohh! - Ohh! Well done! Hold still. Hey! That's the guy that's got the tape. Come on. Miki! I can't believe this is happening. Miki, are you okay? I'll arrange a safe house for you all to stay in. You mean like a jail? No, thanks. Jackie, I know you can take care of yourself, but what about the other 3? Hey, I'm sticking with Jackie until I get my tape back. Where are you going to stay, Jackie? Anywhere... Like lakeisha's place. What? My place? Any problem with that? No, no. No problem. You know, you're all welcome. It'll be like a party. See? No problem. Jackie, be careful. Giancarlo: Well, gentlemen, you asked for a meeting. We've lost a lot of business. There's no product to sell. How can I keep my men if 1 can't pay them? People don't respect us anymore. The vietnamese are moving in on our territory. Man: Damn it, Giancarlo, you've got to do something. Soon, we'll have nothing left. Gentlemen, thank you for your concerns, but I assure you business will continue as usual. You may go. Keeps his house so clean you can't even fart. I'm sorry, boss. We didn't get the tape, and 4 of our guys got blown up. What? Either I get the tape, or you'll never be seen again! Excuse me, boss. There's a phone call for you. Yeah? I've got your cocaine and the tape. 3 P.M. tomorrow, at the golden gardens construction site. Oh? The price is doubled. Thank you very much. Oh, let me do that. Oh, thank you. What did I do wrong? How did things get like this? I need to cheer up. Don't let Jackie worry. Ah, yeah. Don't move. Let me move. Yes, yes. Oh, that feels good. Ahh. Oh, yes. Ohh. Jackie. What is it? What are you doing? Washing dishes. I need to buy something. Now? It's been crazy since I landed. I lost my luggage. I need underwear. It's late. All the shops are closed. What is she saying? Oh. She just wants to buy some clothes. Not a problem. She's a bit smaller than me, but, uh.. Oh, I've got something that should fit her just fine. She said... That I had small breasts. She didn't say you were small, just that you have similar bodies. I heard her say "small". My english is poor, but I understand the word "small". Hers are small, too. She did say "small"... But she didn't mean small. What are you guys talking about? Oh. Oh, she said, "thank you for your generosity." Oh. Come with me. Don't be shy. Think. Did you go anywhere else yesterday? No! Lakeisha and I are just friends. Don't be jealous. I'm not. But you looked intimate... So should I be mean to her? Of course not. Traveling so far, I just don't want to be disappointed. You definitely won't. Really? No problem. The weather here is beautiful. What? Didn't you come with no clothes? Oh, stop. Who are you? Where's the tape? Oh, my god. You want the tape, too? If you find it, please take it! Find it! Just don't hurt anyone. What happened? - Man: Cops! - Huh? What's the matter with you? - Bathroom. - Just hold it. Ok. Don't try anything funny now.

You like to play games? Fine. Let's play one of mine. The judge is looking at the tape right now. You're too emotionally involved. We're really close to breaking this wide open. I don't want a loose Cannon jeopardizing the case. So I'm here to make sure there are no more screw-ups. Now, I want you to cool down. Mm-hmm. Well, here's your chance. Show me what you got.

You wish to see me? Captain Morrison, nea. This is Romeo baggio. Where's Jackie? If you've done anything to him... I have no idea who you're talking about. - Is your name Jackie? - No. - You Jackie? - No. - You? You? - No! I know you. You're the city's biggest drug lords. Well, what exactly are you gonna do about it? You have any evidence? No? Then you can leave. Jackie! Jackie! Hold it! Hold it! I told you to cool it! You know the law. I could shoot you like a dog for trespassing. Relax. Let's get out of here. Come on. Let's go. Can you believe those two? That romeoqo's got big brass ones.

Sorry, captain. Who is that guy, anyway? Did you see anything? No, captain, I didn't see anything. Right. You, uh, boys see anything? All: No, sir. Captain, we got the evidence to put Giancarlo away for good. Take him away. Jackie, we got here as soon as we could. - Really, we did. - Yeah, right. Honest! Shut up. I'm lucky to be here.
