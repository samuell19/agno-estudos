Mr. Armistead, you are... No, got to start over again. That's my first name. Okay. Mr. Maupin, I guess you would call yourself a gay writer. Not really. I'm a writer who is gay. I'm not a gay writer. I write about heterosexuals as well. My writing didn't really flourish until I came out, because it's very impossible to... to keep a huge secret in your heart and be a good writer. I think it's very difficult. And my whole success was concurrent with my coming out sexually. When I was a boy in Raleigh, I was afraid of being locked in Oakwood Cemetery overnight. Every Sunday after church when our blue tailed white Pontiac cruised through the entrance, I fretted about the sign posted above us, "Gates locked at 6:00 p.m." What if they lost track of the time? That enormous gate would clang shut and we would be trapped there all night eating acorns for survival. My brother, my sister, my parents and me, Cemetery Family Robinson. Oakwood Cemetery was not just the landscape of our past, but also the very blueprint of family. My father would eventually lay out the rules for his children in a self-published family history. One thing is certain, the old man wrote, wherever one of these men met success, there was a self-effacing and goodly lady by his side. Back then, I was still too young to realize that there would never be a lady by my side. I felt only this shapeless longing, an oddly grown up ennui born of alienation and silence. Some little boys have this feeling very early on. Sooner or later, though, no matter where in the world we live, we must join the diaspora venturing beyond our biological family to find our logical one, the one that actually makes sense for us. So maybe I was beginning to understand something on those Sunday afternoons in the cemetery. Maybe I sensed that my true genealogy lay somewhere beyond these gates with another family. That would be scary, wouldn't it, to know that my long held dream of family, the one laid out by my father, came with a closing time far more final than 6:00 p.m. Possibly do you mind signing this? No. No. No. That's is what I do. This is for Nadine. - And Olin. - And Olin? Yeah. Thank you. I'm so happy to hear that you're writing your memoir. We've waited with baited breath. When that shit coming out? Seventeen. I'm just delivering it Typical of anything that Armistead is involved with, Tales of the City is a classic. And like a classic, you can pick it up at any time of your life and get something different from it that's just as powerful and just as meaningful. And you laugh, and you cry, and you... you feel close. You feel intimate. And that's something that everyone craves. Initially, he was writing for a San Francisco audience, his neighbors, his friends, people he might meet at a party, or on the street, or at a bar. Just San Francisco people. Oh, no, then when he publishes a book. Well, America discovered it, and... and then we discovered it in Europe. And when Armistead arrives in London for a book reading, he's a Rockstar. And the audience is very varied in age and sexualities. The quirkiness of his writing, the honesty of it, is something that just hooks people and... but all sorts of people. He loves the world but he does find it hilariously funny. Wonderful. How are you, honey? Hey, darling. I'm good. Books in the Castro, who knew? I know. Really. Do people read? I guess they do. They read you. I'm so proud Every morning, a half a million people buy the San Francisco Chronicle. For a lot of them, the most important part of this paper is the inside back page. That's where you read Tales of the City. It also has made a local celebrity out of its author, Armistead Maupin. Not long after I arrived in San Francisco, I was writing feature pieces for a Marin County weekly called the Pacific Sun. And what I wanted to do more than anything was just whacky stories around town. A woman friend of mine told me that I really should go down to the Marin Safeway and check out the hetero cruising scene on Wednesday nights. So, I went down there, and sure enough, there were all these over-dressed young women and men kind of cruising the vegetable aisle. And I tried to find somebody to admit that they had put on that rhinestone studded, brushed denim pantsuit purposefully in order to get picked up. And there was... nobody would tell me that they were there for that purpose. So, I went home completely frustrated and thought I'm going to have to do kind of a fictionalized version of this. And I invented a new girl in town named Mary Ann Singleton. And at the end of her search after meeting a couple of jerks, she meets the man of her dreams and he's there with the man of his dreams. And the story completely struck a nerve, especially with straight women in San Francisco who are figuring out why there were so many attractive but unresponsive men in town. And the editors at the Pacific Sun said why don't you do this every week? Why don't you follow her somewhere else? And so I did for about five weeks, and it was called The Serial back then. While The Serial was appearing, one of the people reading it was Charles McCabe, who was a senior columnist at The Chronicle. And Charles was a brilliant essayist, very misogynistic, totally homophobic, but really liked me, and loved the column. And he said, I was just vulgar enough to make it work in The Chronicle. And so I asked him if he would get me an interview with the editor and publisher at the time, and I assured him that I could write this thing on a daily basis. I lied. I basically lied. I was panicked. I thought how on earth am I going to do this. And then I got the job. The Chronicle was thought of as sort of a colorful paper, and was trying to fit what we thought was a more colorful and vibrant city, and we had a sense that that's sort of what most of our readers wanted. The day after I got the job, I danced down Polk Street. I actually jumped up in the air and clicked my heels together, because I knew that I had landed on something that was going to make me famous. I knew it then, because I had this subject matter that wasn't being covered. I came out to visit San Francisco and saw everyone loving everyone else, and saw so much openness, and I just knew I had to be here. We decided that we had to have more freedom to be ourselves and we came to San Francisco. There was a huge influx of LGBT people in the City, and they weren't being written about. While it was fiction, and therefore, not norm for daily newspaper, that it would be one of the ways that you could represent a lifestyle going on in the City at the time that you couldn't if you were going to restrict yourself to purely, you know, normal reporting. The managing editor of The Chronicle was very nervous about printing fiction in a newspaper. So, it had to have the fictional aspect in the title and it also had to indicate that it was about San Francisco. And so they sent me five possibilities, and among those was Tales of the City. And I looked at it and thought, ooh, that's got kind of a Dickensian ring and so I said, that's the one I want. Mary Ann Singleton was 25 years old when she saw San Francisco for the first time. She came to the City alone for an eight-day vacation. On the fifth night, she drank three Irish coffees at the Buena Vista, realized that her mood ring was blue, and decided to phone her mother in Cleveland. Mary Ann was in many ways, my alter ego, because I was the new girl in town, too. I was looking at this strange new world in a state of perplexity, and wonder, and fear. She maybe judges people a little bit too much, the way I can do in front of a pleasant façade, but I'm thinking what an idiot. Michael Toliver is a romantic, gay man with a big slut side. That's me. I was having fun. I was really having my adolescence, and yet, in each of our little gay boy hearts, there was this thought that you could also be in love. And I poured a lot of my grandmother into the character of Mrs. Madrigal. My grandmother was a suffragist who made speeches all over England. She read my palm when I was a little boy. She was a wonderful air, fairy, almost seemingly psychic old lady. She was really very dear to me. I think the greatest influence on me. And I told my grandmother just before she died at the age of 97, that I had put her spirit into one of the characters and I was so glad to be able to do that. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Good. You're one of us then. Welcome to 28 Barbary Lane. Thank you. Yes, you should. I was born while my father was a skipper of a minesweeper in the South Pacific. He actually found out about my birth through semaphore. It was something like baby boy born, mother and son doing fine. So, I didn't see my father for a year and a half. I was the great great grandson of a Confederate general who died at Antietam. His name was Lawrence O'Brien Branch. He was a U.S. Congressman before he served in the Confederacy, and actually made a speech on the floor of Congress in which he says that he will die for the right to take his property to the new territories because they were passing laws that said that slaves could not be brought to places like New Mexico. And he said this was socialist Europeans imposing themselves on our... our country and our sense of property. And... and he did die for it. So, we were always told that we were Southern aristocracy. We lived in a suburban ranch house that looked kind of like a Howard Johnson's, but we were very aware that, you know, we had good blood. All our Southern heritage was based around the Civil War, the Confederacy, going to the right church, and making your debut, which I was somewhat forced to do, saying yes, ma'am, and yes, sir, and we were very much in that Southern tradition. We were taught to be gentlemen and Southern belles. My father was a lawyer and I can remember going down to visit him downtown. And they had colored water fountains and white water fountains. My father had quite a difficult time with... with civil rights and anything that went against what the type of world he had lived in. I suppose you could say he was a white supremacist. Everything about his life indicated that. I remember going to the beach one time with our maid and her daughter. She must have been ten or eleven. And I got mad at her because she had taken my steam shovel and I called her the N word. And my mother grabbed me by the arm and jerked me away and said, "You do not say that word ever. You've hurt her feelings." And I said, "But daddy says it all the time." "That doesn't matter. He's your father." She stood up for him, and protected him, but privately told her children not to behave that way. My mother was a beautiful, gracious, gentle soul and very loving. She was the buffer I think for us with my father, who, on the other hand, never showed a lot of affection to us. I think we knew he loved us, but I was always forever, for years trying to get his approval and love. And that's sort of the way he setup his relationship with his children. Armistead is my oldest brother. He is five years older than me, and then there's a middle brother, Tony, who is two years older than me. I call my brother Teddy, and I've been calling him that since I can remember. He is Armistead Jones Maupin, Jr. Our father was Big Armistead. When he was a teenager, my mother was always suggesting why don't you go ask Mary Jane out for a date or someone like that. And so I never sort of saw him as a mover and a shaker as... as you know in the dating scene. During the period where I was waiting for Tales to begin, I actually met Rock Hudson. He was visiting San Francisco and invited us up to his suite at the Fairmont Hotel. And he said, "I have a little reading to do." And he produced the bulldog edition of The Chronicle, which was the early edition that appeared the night before. So, he stood up, a little drunkenly, and read the first chapter of Tales of the City, which includes a moment where Mary Ann's mother tells her you have to leave there immediately. I was watching McMillan &amp; Wife and there was a serial killer on the loose. Pick me up. I'll be downstairs. He meant it to be charming and I was charmed. And the next day he and his partner invited me to dinner in San Francisco. Do you want me to go on? I was just going to ask... Oh, how sexy are we going to get here? - Oh, we're going there. - All right. The first time it was at a little French restaurant. They got quite drunk and when the evening was over, Tom said, "I'm just going to go back to the room." And Rock and I caught a cable car up the hill heading up to the Fairmont. And by the time we got up to the Diplomat Suite, Rock and I were sitting across the room from each other and he said at one point, "Well, I should be over there or you should be over here." Which was about as dreamy as something could be. Although I was completely and utterly terrified. And I just did not perform well at all and it was very touching, because apparently, it happened to him all the time. And he sat next to me and put his arm around me and said, "You know I'm just a regular guy." And I said, "No, you're not. And I'm Doris Day." Don't take your bedroom problems out on me. I have no bedroom problems. There's nothing in my bedroom that bothers me. Oh, that's too bad. There was a second time and there was once with him and his partner. Oh, and there was a time after a gallery opening. I just eventually stopped trying to get together with him because I was coming out of the closet and he was firmly in it. And I ended up writing about him in Further Tales of the City, but I put blanks where his name would be. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We are proud to present Armistead Maupin. Thank you. Drunken bears, there's nothing like it. I grew up in Raleigh in the South, and had a very... Okay, you can clap for it if you want. You know there are a lot... you know, so many things to still love about the South except possibly the people and the politicians. But I grew up trying to please my daddy. He was all I'd ever had in terms of a moral compass. And so, everything he said I thought, well, it must be true, because he says it. And I was actually embracing conservatism. By the time I was 16 years old, I remember being interviewed by the Raleigh paper and I said, "We young conservatives are going to make a difference when we grow up." This is Viewpoint, the daily editorial expression of WRAL Television voiced by Jesse Helms. Michigan's very liberal senior United States Senator... I flunked out of law school. So, I thumbed home to Raleigh and told my father I didn't want to be a lawyer. And he said, "We'll get you a job." So, he talked to a friend of his, and he said, "Well, you can come down and work for him at the TV station, and write news." And so, Jesse Helms gave me my first writing job. He thought I was the hope of the future. The only fucking thing he's ever been right about. That man's legacy was in the hatred he spewed his entire life. I was sent out one day by Jesse Helms to cover a Klan rally. And I interviewed the Imperial Wizard. And at the time, Dean Rusk, who was the Secretary of State, had a daughter who had married an African American man. And I asked the Imperial Wizard what he thought about it. And he said, "Well, what else would you expect from a man who's a practicing homosexual?" And I went back to the station and told Jesse this scoop I had gotten, and Jesse went white. Whiter than he normally was and said, "That is absolutely the worst thing you can say about anybody." And I took it on. I heard it. I knew it was nothing that you could be. But Jesse was the first person that just spelled out what an awful thing it was. Many homosexuals average 16 different sex partners every month. The reason I am embraced conservatism was I was terrified of who I was. And so you keep the lid on, and you want the lid on for everybody else, and they all have to march in that straight line. I volunteered for Vietnam, because I think I still had some manhood issues going on and I wanted to go to the war. My mother said I had a Lawrence of Arabia complex, which was a lot closer than she knew. And I found myself volunteering for more and more rigorous places because I need to write home colorful stories to my father to show that I was fighting for my country. And I ended up in a little place on the Cambodian border called Chau Doc. I met Armistead in November of December of 1969. I was kind of shocked in some ways, because, while I hadn't been trained for a lot of the things I had to do on the boats when I got there, especially going out in the weeds and laying up ambushes and all that type of thing, Armistead came out from Saigon, where he was serving as a protocol officer and he hadn't been trained for anything that was out where we were either. He went out and learned what he was going, and went up and down the canals, and I admired him for all that, because it can get pretty dangerous. You're asked to go and do it, and you do it, and you remember it, and you should be proud of it at times. Maybe you don't agree with why you're there, but you... you're there. Hell no, we won't go. Hell no, we won't go. Hell no, we won't go. We cannot consider ourselves America's best men when we are ashamed of and hated what we were called on to do in Southeast Asia. I had a friend call me. He asked me if I would come to Washington and do press releases for John Kerry, who at that time, was organizing the Vietnam Veterans Against the War. I didn't feel the way Mr. Kerry did, and as a result, I got pretty angry and wanted to do something. So, I wrote a letter to Admiral Zumwalt and asked if the government would help out with a project in which Vietnamese veterans could return to Vietnam to help the Vietnamese people. Ten of us went back to Vietnam on a humanitarian project and built houses. It looked like a bad motel, really, when we were done. We had no skill at all. But at the end of it, the White House called and said that President Nixon wants to see me in the Oval Office. We showed up at the White House and were ushered in to meet Richard Nixon, and I was immediately aware of how insecure he was. The fact that you served there and were willing to go back and help the people there, of course, really demonstrates so clearly what it's all about. I have never seen a figure as spectacular as the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese women are actually... They're so sexy in their little Áo dài. You know they fly out when they ride their bicycles, and it's real... And I thought oh, my god, the... He picked the queer to say this to, you know. My father was over the moon. You know, I had worked for Jesse Helms. I had met Nixon. Nixon had invited me back. I was doing everything, everything that I needed to do to make him happy. He was very, very proud of me. And he hadn't... he still didn't know the main truth about me. The first time I met Armistead, we talked about the strangeness of writing fiction that is being read as you go along. I was doing Sandman and you were doing in The Chronicle that sort of Dickensian thing of writing serial fictions. Did things ever happen that surprised you when you realized how well you had set things up without... All the time. ...realizing what you were doing? All the time. The coolest things I have ever done have just come out of the moment. We've both been conscious of keeping an audience with a story. When they hired me, they said, "We need six weeks' worth." So, that was 30 episodes, 30 chapters. Pretty soon, I got confident enough, that I just goofed off, and I just ate up my whole backlog. So, I would have to come in and think you have to write something. This woman was coming over to my desk and saying, "Write." What was amazing about Armistead was that he would come in in the morning, no notebook, no notes, no help, and he's sit down at a desk that was bare of anything, at an IBM Selectric typewriter, which is unforgiving. What impressed me is actually how good he was at getting that copy out in a short time five days a week. I kind of identified with Mary Ann Singleton. I'm a straight laced, middle class, Midwestern person. So, I was really fascinated by this world that was opening up to me and to all of The Chronicle's readers too. And I think I've repressed a lot of what... of the stories in there, because you know I suppose part of me didn't quite approve. I remember that in that column, two men woke up in bed together. The morphing from just being a... a sort of interesting, unusual, somewhat controversial column aimed at the colorful youth of San Francisco, it did slowly morph into obviously being a largely gay themed column. But it happened slowly and I'm sure a lot of people were picking up on it way before I was. The managing editor of The Chronicle, who was sort of in charge of handling Tales, got very nervous when he realized that Michael Toliver was going to be a regular character, and that other gay characters, and lesbians were showing up. So, he actually created a chart in his office. And when characters were introduced, he would put them into the appropriate column. And the theory was that it should at no time be more than 30 % homosexual. It annoyed me so much, that I had a quota. His fiction is almost a Trojan horse. It smuggles in all sorts of things and all sorts of things under the guise of being a fantastic story about people you're interested in. My intention with Anna Madrigal from the very beginning, was that she be transgender. I'd made the mistake of telling or maybe not the mistake when I look back on it, but I told the editors and they were pretty horrified. And they said, "Well, you cannot say anything about that for a while." Their fear actually served me, because I could develop her as a character, and make her a woman of mystery, and have people curious about her at the same time that they're learning to love her. So, that by the time that I did tell her story, they would be onboard, and that's exactly what happened. We all did it stealth back then. No one was way, way out. I was just starting to come way, way out. We were mostly all like Anna Madrigal in those days. We wanted to be respectable. We wanted people not to know except who wanted them to know. I wasn't like that. I just said, "Fuck it. Here, this is me. Not a man. Not a woman." I moved to San Francisco in '88, started immediately reading the books then. I thought look at this, a transsexual who isn't a serial killer, isn't a rapist, isn't some kind of terrible pervert, is just a nice person. And they're just weren't that many role models. I think there were a lot of young, gay men and women and trans people who... who had nothing to hang onto, who had no story. And Armistead did it. He gave them a sense of hope, and joy, and security. What I wanted out of literature and what I had never found in literature was a story that would incorporate everyone, that would place my life in the context of the rest of the world. So that gay people, and straight people, and in between people would fit together all on one large canvas and function lovingly with each other. And I'm sure that there was a lot of nervousness on the part of the management as to just how far Army was going with his stories and of course they... they were concerned about readership. They didn't want anybody cancelling their subscriptions because of something offensive in the paper. "Down with the gay life in quotes." They still say that. Why do you call it gay when it's not gay? Well, it is gay. It's very gay in every sense of the world. You know when people get really angry and start flinging Jesus at you, that you've... you're speaking some truth. I loved that one. Loved that one. This just tells me that they were into it. I lured them into a world they didn't want to think about. The idea that he was doing this in a newspaper in a... in what they call a family newspaper, that is not just groundbreaking. That takes chutzpa and, you know, testicles the size of asteroids. I first became interested in photography when I was in my early twenties. I was a model in Milan and... and London as well. And just working with all these amazing photographers, sort of got me interested. And I was always a little shy on the other side of the camera. It was sort of a stretch, which is one of the reasons I wanted to do it. And it also interested me because it was a way to combine very technical stuff as well as creative work. Darling. Armistead and Chris, they're like some kind of strange storybook couple, in that each of them is the other one's ideal. It's like Armistead was being written by a beneficent creator with a plan, who started off going okay, you are going to be this repressed right-wing kid from North Carolina but just stick through the story, and at the end, you will get your happily ever after. The way that Chris and I met was sort of a combination of the old and the new. My housekeeper had been on this website called DaddyHunt. It was just for older men in general, who were finding each other on it. And I noticed in the personals there this young guy who the most beautiful blue-eyed gaze. He was gorgeous. My younger friends were saying, "Oh, my God, he's really hot." And I said, "Forget it. He only likes them over 45." The way he tells it, is that he stumbled over my profile and was sort of stopped by it and printed out my photo, and put it on his desk, and but never really had any intention of contacting me through the site. And then one day, I was walking through the Castro and I saw him, and we... our eyes... we... we did the little cruisy thing. You were coming this way. Uh-huh. And I was going that way. And we did the old-fashioned stop and twirl. And I just turned around and went back to him and said perfect line, just remembered, it's so good, "Didn't I see you on a website?" And I said, "Which one?" Which thrilled me because at the time, this was like right after I had launched the site. Well, it turned out he owned the website. And that some of the captions appreciating older men had been his. When I started DaddyHunt, a lot of it for me was a political statement, because I had always been attracted to older men, but I felt like a lot of the gay community was very ageist. The original tagline was wiser, stronger, hotter. I really wanted to emphasize that there were qualities of getting older that... that should be respected. The disparity between the two of us that a lot of people don't understand is not an issue, because we understand it. We understand what we have. He has made me feel more confident in my body than I have ever been myself. I've started to own this, for instance. A lot of guys like that, amazingly. Pretty much since day one, Armistead and I acknowledged that we wanted to have an open relationship. I think part of it was from past experience in other relationships, realizing that not only the relationships that I had been in, but many friends that I witness who are supposedly monogamous, aren't. You know, and I just felt like it would be better to be able to be honest about it. You know, I resist the term open relationship, because it looks to me like a Facebook announcement like there's an enormous breeze blowing through your relationship. As a young man, I... it used to bother me. I came with all the fool's, romantic, heterosexual, it will be one person forever. And somewhere inside of me, I knew that that was a tough thing to pull off. Some people do, and I'm happy for them. I don't think there is one way to be married, whether it be you're gay or straight. What we both wanted was fidelity. The notion that this person is with you no matter what. And that if you love that person enough, you can give the freedom to let them explore a little on the side, or sometimes with you. That's another aspect of it. It's very nice. So, I think we've accomplished something that makes me feel more loved than ever. And I hope he feels that way about it. I had know that I was attracted to men ever since I was 12 years old, but I didn't do anything about it until I was about 25. So, I had a long, long period there where I... Gestation period. Gestation period where I had no sex with anyone really. I'm a... I'm what they call a perfect Kinsey 6. I've never had sex with a woman, but and I waited a long time before I had sex with a man I was-- A few drag queens though. Never. Never. I'd like to tell you about the first time I had sex. I hope yours was better than mine was. Oh, my God. I didn't have sex with anybody until I was about 25 years old. And I was living in Charleston, South Carolina, and I'm sure it was the last time I was ever in a dark park in all innocence. I had gone down there to sit on a bench, and look at the moonlight on the water, and enjoy the scenery, and a man walked up to me and said, "Have you got the time?" And I said, "No, I don't. I'm sorry." And he said, "Have you got a light?" And I said, "No." Finally, I said, "Listen, I don't think I'm what you're looking for." I knew what he was up to. And he apologized and kind of scurried away. And... and I sat there on the bench for a while and I thought what are you fucking up to? You're exactly what he's looking for. I hurried back into the park where this guy was hitting on another guy. I interrupted them while they were... "I'm so sorry I was so rude back there. Would you like to come to my house? It's right over there. And like we could have a drink." So, I snatched this guy away from this completely dumbfounded man and we went back to my little carriage house, and it took less than five minutes. I'm pretty sure I got a dick in my mouth, and that he did, too. And I could just picture in that particular moment Peggy Lee in the corner of the room singing the song that was so popular that summer. What was it? "Is that all there is?" Thank you, very much. It was 1969. That was the summer of the moonshot. That was the summer of Stonewall. Sort of appropriate, really, that I negotiated to lose my virginity on the spot where the first shots of the Civil War were fired. But the next morning something amazing happened. I realized I'd passed this point of no return that I had dreaded my whole life. You know, so what if it wasn't the best thing in the world? There might be other people who came to that park. And maybe I could get it right. And it wasn't so much the death of innocence as a kind of brand new, adolescence that made me feel like a reborn person. What about life in San Francisco? Does a straight person need to be aware? What's happened in San Francisco is that the 15 % or 10 % of the population that is gay, is open about it. People have learned to accept, learned to get over the stereotypes, learned to get over their prejudice, and it's a healthy atmosphere that's taking place. I met Armistead in the early '70s. He had that Southern manner and he was so polite, and he was just funny. You know, so you just felt as if he had the world in his hands. But he had not come out at that time. I took him all over San Francisco. You know, it's been a Wild West for so long. And you just would walk out the door and you'd smell people smoking dope, and there would be music everywhere. You just felt great. I mean I didn't always feel great, because I overdid it a little bit, more than I should have most of the time, but it was a wonderful time. I saw San Francisco on my way to and from Vietnam. When I processed out of the Navy out on Treasure Island, I had a mix of feelings, because part of me wanted to stay in the Navy. I loved it. I loved the uniforms, and the camaraderie, and the men. But I knew if I actually acted on what I was feeling, that I would be in big trouble. And I remember looking over at this white city there on the edge of the water and wondering if I could live there. And it wasn't until the Associated Press offered me a gig in San Francisco, that I knew I had the opportunity to do that. So, I leapt at it. I remember telling a guy that I had actually picked up in the park in Charleston that I was moving to San Francisco, and he said, "Oh, my God. You'll love it there. They've got 50 gay bars." And I said, rather primly, I'm sure, "Oh, I would never go into one of those." Of course, I was in one of those on my first night in town. I went down to the Rendezvous on Sutter Street. And there were guys in there slow dancing to Streisand. I think it was "People." It was a horrifying sight to me. My first good friend in town was a red-headed woman. And I decided I was going to tell her that I was gay because I wanted a new life and I didn't see any reason to be lying now that I was in town. And so I went over to her house, and I was drunk by that time from about three mai tais and said, "I have something to tell you." And I hemmed, and hawed, and she came over and... and... and sort of took my hands in hers and looked up at me and said, "What? What is it?" And I said, "I'm homosexual." And she looked at me for a moment and then said... "Oh, big fucking deal. We... you know we love you. Who cares? And half of San Francisco is gay." Sophisticated straight people in San Francisco were more comfortable with my sexuality than I was. Because I was still proudly hanging the picture of me shaking hands with Richard Nixon, and I would pick up guys down on Polk Street and bring them back to the house, and they would see the picture of me with Nixon, and they would, you know look a little bit disgusted and horrified as if they'd just found out they were... had gone home with Jeffrey Dahmer. It was... it... it... and I... and I took that on. I mean I think I... you know, I think I'm still, part of me, the... my whole life I've been trying to please people, and... and then I got here and I thought nobody is happy with my life the way it was. Nobody is happy with it. I was the one that changed. I came out. I finally became myself as a person and my heart opened up. The sexual aspect of it, I can't minimize that. There was just something amazing about, you know, I could... I would go to the baths, and I would have sex, and the very process of you know lying in someone's arms and cuddling, it opened my heart to such an extent, that I started just taking the world in in a different way. Some of those guys that I'd lie with were of another color, another race. You know, everything I'd ever been taught, was falling away, and I just realized what it was to be with another human being, what human feelings were. And that made me examine all the little prejudices that I'd been given when I was growing up. It wasn't just racist stuff. It was my family telling me that I was better than anybody because it was in my bloodline, you know. This nonsense. And it made me into a writer. That's what it did, among other things. It made me into a writer. My grandmother and I were once, when I was like 14 years old, were walking to a garden party in Raleigh, and there was a woman ahead of us that was all just femmed out to the nines. Pink, and perfumed, and powdered, and little spike heels, and... And my grandmother turned to me with this sort of sly little smile on her face and said, "Any women who is all woman, or any man who is all man, is a complete monster unfit for human company." And that's always been my rule for writing characters, you know. We're all a mix of these things. I try to find the part of us that isn't black, or white, or male, or female, or any of those things but human, the part... the part that comes from the heart. And that is simply the function of the writer. In my novel Maybe the Moon, it's told from the viewpoint of a heterosexual, Jewish, dwarf actress working in Hollywood. Okay. "When you're my size and not being tormented by elevator buttons, water fountains and ATMs, you spend your life accommodating the sensibilities of 'normal people'..." "You do it if you want to belong to the human race." Maybe the Moon is a novel about a friendship between a gay man and a woman who's a little person. The little person Armistead was friends with that the book is inspired by was the woman inside the E.T. costume. What I remember about it was just how much I understood and related to the little woman's voice. She wasn't a victim and I really loved that. She was dignified, and smart, and just had a normal life, and there wasn't anything mysterious, or kooky, or fantastical, you know. I was the only little person in my entire family, in my entire surrounding and I was always the black sheep in that sense, and it was very difficult for me. And it was very isolating. So, I couldn't wrap my head around how this normal size, white, gay man, how could he possibly walk in my shoes? I'm like a 3'10," you know, gimpy Mexican. But I just can't help believing he can relate to just being different and not by choice. By the end of the book, my self-worth went from like here to here. It was... it... it was life changing, really. It was just nice. It was the first time in my life that I felt someone out there understands. In 1976 I had just moved to San Francisco and it seems as though Tales of the City started the week that we moved there, and was our guide to San Francisco, and everything that was going on and what we were discovering. If you make your list of the major characters beginning with Ann Madrigal, and going down, you will miss one of them. And that character is San Francisco. We are here at Macondray Lane, which was the inspiration for Barbary Lane. Actually, the steps were the... were the inspiration to me because when I was living in the neighborhood, I saw them one day and wondered what was up there. I was just fascinated by the idea of this little city street and I just made my way up the steps into this little wonderland. It was sort of a combination of an English village story and an urban tale. Oh, there's one over there. I still think this is the most special place on earth, so to be associated with it, is just... it's a great joy. I started writing Tales in 1976. So, I had two full years of writing five days a week, 800 words a day. It was agonizing but kind of exhilarating, too. I was contacted by an editor in New York and he asked me to send him Xeroxed copies of the columns, because he thought there was a novel there. The miniseries didn't happen until 1993. I think everyone quite wrongly thought that she wasn't very smart. And really what she was is she was a new person in a strange land. And that anybody can relate to. She arrived there and just didn't know what any of the rules were. So, she was awkward, and overwhelmed, and excited, but not dumb. Hello? And that's fun to play. Hello? Hello. I'm Mrs. Madrigal, as in medieval. The research on Anna Madrigal was really interesting, because I don't know, shit all anything here. And I... Alan Poul was the producer, and I called him up and I said, "I've got to talk to a transgendered individual." So, he found someone and invited them to my apartment, and I open the door and there's this guy 6'3" - somebody who had been a guy - 6'3", who was now a woman. But the initial look was much more masculine, you... you know. And his hands were like basketball. People who play basketball. I mean, it was like... but the voice was soft, and sweet, and dear, and it was like, okay. She looked at me and I said, "Tell me, what was it that you wanted so much?" And what this woman said to me was, "All my life, I yearned for the friendship of women." Now, I didn't know what she was going to say, but that one really... I mean I, even now, it's like... I thought... I don't know what... I expected something sexual. I didn't expect something so deeply human, something that was about people's feelings, and people's.... it shows you how stupid was. Now, I know what it is to want the friendship of women. And I want her to be my friend. That's what I had learned. And so you see the old dame does have a past after all. Oh, I'm prying, aren't I? I hope it means we're friends. Tales of the City broke the kiss barrier, which is funny, because it was a big barrier. I mean, you forget that man-on-man kissing, which is now regularly featured on every Shondra Rhimes show, in a much more explicit way than it ever was with... with Mouse and John, was a big taboo. Even showing two men in bed together with the implication that they had had sex in that bed, was a really difficult thing to do on television. You cheated. The show was also a gigantic success. In many PBS markets, it was the highest rated drama series they've ever had. In other markets, it was second only to Upstairs Downstairs. And in San Francisco, we beat the networks, which doesn't happen with PBS. Coming off the heels of the great success of Tales of the City, they went into pledge drive mode. Give us money so that we can continue to bring you groundbreaking, wonderful programming like Tales of the city. "Something from my garden as a welcome from us all, Anna Madrigal." Hi, everybody. I'm Mary Hart. And I'm John Tesh. Nude scenes, sexy romance, graphic language, gay lovers, narcotics. We are talking X-rated movie, right? No. It's a miniseries right in Mr. Roger's Neighborhood on PBS. There was already a huge amount of momentum certainly within the Republican Party that American public funds should not be spent on material that is controversial, should not be spent on material that some people might object to, should not be spent on material that can't survive in the marketplace. The question is whether or tax dollars, tax payers are going to be forced to help pay for one homosexual to have anal intercourse with another homosexual and to put that into a movie. Donald Wildmon and the American Family Association very famously put together this little 12-minute trailer of highlights from Tales of the City. There was men kissing. They itemized how many times somebody was naked. There was an underwear contest. I remember they went and they counted every swear word. Beats the shit out of Tarot cards. I forgot one of the most important ones, drugs. I don't know how many times they must have had to watch the thing in order to get all that information. They delivered it to every member of Congress. And the idea that anybody in the U.S. Congress or anywhere else could watch it with a straight face, is kind of astonishing. And the PBS lowered the boom. The shit hit the fan. It was... it was amazing. What the hell is going on when the taxpayers are required to fund such garbage as that? This was the time when Jesse Helms was talking about defunding both the NEA and PBS. So, I was in the thick of things with... with... with my old boss. All the genuine commitments that PBS had given to producing the second series, were immediately reversed. We've got to understand that all of us become a part of what we condone. I still am disappointed that that happened, because I think they would have made them all. I think they would have done the whole series. And... and they didn't. Is everything alright, Mrs. Madrigal? Naïve as it may sound, we felt we had made a beautiful, loving show about family and about everybody's right to search for love. And there was nothing salacious in it. So, the idea that this was so incendiary is difficult to grasp, because when you look at now, you see it for... for what... for what it was and for what it was always intended to be, which is a valentine. It's a different world we're living in now. Oh, my God. And on network television, I get surprised. I... you know, I don't want to come off, you know... you know, all, you know, uptight, but the line between actor and sex worker is a very fuzzy one today. It really is. Can I tell you something? Of course. I think it might be cool with me if you... You want me to fuck you? Yeah. I met Armistead while we were shooting Looking. I'd heard about the legend of Tales of the City. Just as like a young, gay man wanting to... wanting to sort of like dive in to this world that I'd heard about before, because I was in the closet from like 19 to 23 with a boyfriend who was my roommate. And in the moment of doing it, I... I felt... fine. It... everything was compartmentalized and I had it all figured out. I was doing a show on Broadway called Spring Awakening, where I was playing a straight, romantic male lead. And I never lied and said that I was straight, but I always kind of like dodged the bullet. And it really wasn't until I came out, that I understood how suffocated I was when I was in the closet. It's like once you're out, you're like, oh, my God, I can't beli... It's like taking a... like a deep breath for the first time and you didn't realize that you were ho... Well, for me, I didn't realize that I was holding my breath all that time. Actor Rock Hudson is in a hospital in Paris this morning. One report is that he has liver cancer. Another that he has AIDS. But none of this has been confirmed. He was brought to the American Hospital's emergency room Sunday night, complaining he was exhausted. This morning he met with his secretary. Nothing. He looks wonderful, I must say. Because I was no longer in contact with Rock, I was as confounded as anybody else when I heard he had AIDS. All my friends were public about it when they got sick. When he showed upon Doris Day's pet show looking really bad, there was all that speculation. And the people around him were still saying, "Oh, he has anorexia, he's been on a watermelon diet." Just the worst kind of lying and obfuscation that was... it was way too late for it. Anybody who'd been through the whole process of AIDS, knew it was. Randy Shiltz, the first openly gay reporter and The Chronicle and a friend of mine called up and said, "Are you willing to talk about Rock?" So, I said, "Yes, of course, he was gay. Everybody in Hollywood knew it. This should not be a scandal." So, I talked about it publicly. I was the first person to do it. Meaning I... officially, I outed him. The guy that had introduced me to Rock called me up sobbing at night and said, "How could you do that to that beautiful man?" A political columnist in the... in the local gay paper said, "How can you call yourself a friend and do that?" You were supposed to keep the secret, and I knew that the secret was what was poisoning us. Sometimes the truth just has to be told and there are systems that have enslaved us all. And the biggest one is the closet. Armistead's come on the side of outing many people. People who said it's my personal life, and I don't think it enters into my work, and he thinks it's important, yes, that they need to acknowledge that. His belief is that when you do not talk about that, and you are part of a community, a cultural group that is stigmatized by people being silent, you have a responsibility, if you belong, to acknowledge you belong. Especially with somebody like Rock Hudson whose status in Hollywood had so much influence on how people perceived who was appropriate as a movie star. So, yes, he was, in Armistead's mind, the person who really had to come out. I don't agree with that. I will do that if I find out that someone has been homophobic, and acting homophobically, and speaking and writing homophobically, and they're closed, phht, I'll fucking out them. Hell, yeah. But for a person just to go on... No. No. No, no. Why on earth would you say something about the person? Armistead's response, I... I supported because if people are going to be gay to their friends and to some strangers, is it then the responsibility of those friends and strangers to lie on their behalf? I should tell you about a moment in my life that Armistead participated in. It would be, I suppose, the mid to late '80s. I was doing a solo show in San Francisco, and... and met up with Armistead and his partner at the time, Terry. And I said, not entirely out of the blue, "Do you think I should come out?" And he and Terry looked at each other, and smiled, and... and nodded vigorously, and I... I think at that point, it was a time when very few people in public life were... were out. And his first reaction was, "Well, you'll feel better about yourself if you come out." Which was true. "And it will be very good for a lot of other people who don't feel able to come out to... to see someone in public life doing it." And I think that was the appeal to him. And it was just a few months later that I came out. I don't think I would have done with the assurance, and confidence, and need perhaps, even, unless I'd had that crucial evening with Armistead and Terry in San Francisco. So, I think of Ter... Terry and Armistead as my godfathers, really. Changed my life for the better. I met Armistead, I think I was probably about seven years old. And I can't... I can't remember if we had met or not. I just remember seeing him. He had done a signing at my family's bookstore, which was on Polk and California, which was called Paperback Traffic. The bookstore also was very gay, and so it was the perfect place for a signing of Tales of the City. Just a very, very big deal that he was there, because Tales of the City really is all about that neighborhood. It was a pretty exciting time just in San Francisco, because this was before AIDS. If this thing that gay men are getting in the States, it's a severe immune deficiency. When I think about AIDS, it's really like the... my whole world disappeared. My family lost their business. They... they couldn't... they couldn't keep it open, because there was no customers, because everybody died. The... all the employees, you know, a lot of them are gone, and it's really... it's hard to separate what happened in... in my life from what happened in the books. I had had so many valiant friends who had died of AIDS, people who were openly gay, who were talking about their illness in the face of the most extraordinary... mistreatment. And their parents were throwing them out, you know. They were dying and their parents were rejecting them. John Fielding was the first character in fiction anywhere who had died of AIDS. It was the only way I could cope with it to... to take my own... the pain I was feeling about the death of my friends and make other people feel it. Uh-oh. You have a hicky. Where? Right here on your neck. There was a huge outcry, and a lot of gay people wrote me and said, "How dare you spoil our light morning entertainment with your political agenda?" They didn't get it. It would be impossible to write about San Francisco in that period and not bring it up. It would be kind of insulting in a way to all of the people who were living with it and living through it. And so, why not tell that deep and heartbreaking story of AIDS? I had a two-week period where I was certain that I had AIDS, because it took two weeks for the test to come back. And I remember going to my doctor and wanting some assurance that I didn't, and he started trembling and said, "I don't even know whether I have it." None of us did. We all lived with the assumption that we had it and that we were going to die. And that's one of the reasons why I ended Tales of the City in 1989, because I had established Michael Toliver as a gay character who is HIV positive and I didn't want to continue the tradition of killing off the gay man at the end. I don't know how much time I have left, whether it's two years, or five, or fifty, Everyone I have loved since the epidemic started has been HIV positive. I knew Chris was positive when I met him. And both my partner at the time, Terry, and my best friend Steve were diagnosed at roughly the same time. Steve and I tried to have a little romance, but we weren't made for each other in that way, but we were so made for each other as friends. He taught me everything I knew at the time about Bette Davis, Busby Berkeley, and Bette Midler, the holy B's. And he was 15 years younger than I was, and didn't even remember these people, but he was one of those gay men who knew our lore. And I just adored him. What made you realize that you were gay? A big man. Will you shut up? I have to keep him under control. Steve loved those old Busby Berkeley songs. So, I was always playing "Let's Face the Music and Dance", you know. "There may be trouble ahead." I'll cry if I repeat the rest of it. "But... but while there's music and moonlight, and love, and romance, let's face the music and dance." And there were a lot of gay men who were doing... doing that at the time. ♪ There may be trouble ahead ♪ ♪ But while there's moonlight And music and love And romance ♪ ♪ Let's face the music And dance ♪ Steve was a wonderfully open person who made no secret of having AIDS, because he felt that it would make life easier for people who came after him. A day doesn't go by in which I don't feel the impact of AIDS in some way. I've lived with a man that I've loved for the past ten years, and we've known from the very beginning that he was HIV positive. Maybe part of me thought that I would be the one that would be sticking it out with Terry till the end. They called it a cocktail divorce. It's what happens when the HIV medications come along and someone who's thought he's going to die, no longer thinks he's going to die and the first thing he wants to do is breakup. So, when the cocktail came along, and he had that choice, I didn't see that coming. It was a hard time. It was a very, very hard time for me. Probably one of the hardest of my life. But you have to get through... you know everybody who has ever been through a breakup, knows that is. Finding your way back to yourself again. Olympia and Laura were terrific during that period in my life, because I was very fragile. I think I must have been crying a fair amount on the phone with them. My first marriage had just ended and Armistead flew to Hartford and then in a great sort of Southern tradition, we were just with each other. And... and it strengthens your spine when you're feeling confused, and heartbroken, and in grief, that life is changing in a way that you didn't expect. And we sort of clung to each other during that period of time. And... and... and then, after... I think it was... I think it was after that, Armistead invited me to... to be with him during the San Francisco Gay Pride Parade. And he was one of the grand marshals, and so I was... I got to be his lady in waiting. And I found the original Mary Ann Singleton dress, the striped one, and I wore that, and we were in the back of the car sitting, and we were both brokenhearted. I was brokenhearted. Armistead was brokenhearted. We were really vulnerable, you know, sad, mopey people at the time. And I remember there were people screaming our names in adoration. Armistead! Laura! Mary Ann! And Armistead started to laugh, and he laughed, and laughed, and laughed. And the journalist from The Chronicle took a picture at that exact moment, and that's the photo that they ran the next day, was that moment of... of us both just in disbelief that we were so brokenhearted and yet, at the same time, being so feted in a community of people who were so loving, who had so much love to give to us. You can tell by the applause, we're here with the grand marshal, Armistead Maupin, and one of the stars from Tales of the City, of course, Laura Linney. How... how's the parade going for you? Oh, it's just heaven. This is the best seat in town. You get to see everything. A lot of fun and feeling a lot of love. Absolutely. It's the best feeling in the world, really. My father had left out big chunks of the family history. His father killed himself, I think with a shotgun, in his home while his family was there. It was never talked about. I wrote a novel about it, finally, in 2000. And I guess the knowledge of that at 15 on my part, made me start looking at my father in a different way, and realized that maybe so much of this anger, so much of his political posturing, and I figured that it may have come from that moment where he had to suddenly be the man of the family. And he was pissed off. I would... I would have been pissed off. And I always worried that my... my father would do the same himself. I lived in terror of that, actually. And I suppose I let him get away with a lot of stuff, and maybe my mother did, too. She knew that about him, too. In some ways he was just a big baby crying. I was up in New York and we were shooting the Night Listener, and there's a character in there that is sort of him. I'd be careful if I was you. Why? Well, folks could talk, that's all. About what? Use your damn head. Just because you're shut down, doesn't mean we all have to be. What kind of new age crap is that? And my sister called and said, appar... "You should get home. He's not doing well." Chris, my husband, tells me that my response to that initially was, um... fuck him, I can't take it. I remember saying to Armistead that you know it's... that he would regret it if we didn't at least make the trip. You know, what could it hurt to just go and you know see him while he was on his deathbed. And so, we went down and daddy fell in love with Chris, this man 30 years my junior, and Chris drove us around town, and to any locales that my father wanted to go to. His house on Hillsboro Street, the one where my grandfather killed himself. And we went out to the cemetery, which had been an old family ritual. For me, it was significant, because my father is very conservative, and I knew that it was a big stretch for him to be accepting me and us as a couple. And I remember before we left, when... as we were saying goodbye, you know, his dad said to me, you know, "You take care of that boy." And now, that's a 90-year-old man telling a 30-year-old man to take care of a 60-year-old man. He mellowed towards the end, and he did tell me he was proud of me. He just wasn't proud of the part that I thought of as central to my life. Many homosexuals have become active in the defense of what they call gay rights. Nowhere is that defense under greater attack than in Miami, Florida. Anita Bryant was once known as an orange juice saleswoman. Not anymore. She has been selling her Save Our Children group. And I know that there is hope for the homosexuals, that if they're willing to turn from sin, the same as any individual, that... that they can be ex-homosexuals the same as there can be an ex-murderer, or an ex-thief, or an ex-anybody. During the time that Anita Bryant was doing her anti-gay campaign in Florida, and Teddy took her on, Newsweek decided they were going to do an article about him, and it was going to... gay author, Armistead Maupin. And he didn't want his father to find out that way. So, that's when he wrote the letter. My own coming out letter to my parents, I published in The Chronicle as the letter of one of the characters in my serial. And so, that my... my literary life and my personal life were running concurrently. Okay. Okay. This is the letter, The Letter to Mama that Michael writes. He says, "Dear Mama..." "I have friends who think I'm foolish to write this letter. I hope they're wrong. I hope their doubts are based on parents who loved and trusted them less than mine do. I hope, especially, that you'll see this as an act of love on my part, a sign of my continuing need to share my life with you." "I wouldn't have written I guess if you hadn't told me about your involvement in the Save Our Children campaign. That, more than anything, made it clear that my responsibility was to tell you the truth. That your own child is homosexual." "No, mama, I wasn't recruited. No seasoned homosexual ever served as my mentor, but you know what? I wish someone had. I wish someone older than me, and wiser than the people in Orlando had taken me aside and said, 'It's all right, kid, you can grow up to be a doctor, or a teacher just like everyone else. You're not crazy, or sick, or evil. You can succeed and be happy and find peace with friends, all kinds of friends, who don't give a damn who you go to bed with. Most of all, though, you can love and be loved without hating yourself for it.'" "I know this may be hard for you to believe, but San Francisco is full of men and women, both straight and gay, who don't consider sexuality in measuring the worth of another human being. These aren't radicals or weirdos, mama. They are shop clerks, and bankers, and little old ladies, and people who nod and smile at you when you meet them on the bus." "And their message is so simple. Yes, you are a person. Yes, I like you. Yes, it's all right for you to like me, too." "All I know is this, if you and papa are responsible for the way I am, then I thank you with all my heart. For it's the light and the joy of my life." ♪There's not much else I can say ♪ ♪ Except that I'm the same Micheal you've always known ♪ ♪ You just know me better now ♪ "Please don't feel you have to answer this right away. It's enough for me to know that I no longer have to lie to the people who taught me to value the truth." "Mary Ann sends her love. Everything is fine at 28 Barbary Lane. Your loving son, Michael." I wanted a response from my own parents, which I didn't get. My mother was dying of cancer at the time. It was how I came out to them. They were subscribing to The Chronicle and I knew when they got to that, they would know it was me. It was just too close for comfort. But my father wrote me a very terse little letter on his legal pad that said, "Any extra stress on your mother is only going to make her die faster." Not nice. I, a few years back, coined a phrase. I refer to the logical family as opposed to your biological family. It's clearer and clearer as I get older, that sometimes people who... that you share blood with are not coming along with you on the ride. And it's time to stop punishing yourself about that and just realize where the real love, and support, and unconditional love is coming from in your life. In this new crazy culture that we live in that has gotten so far away from our old school tribal village culture, we move into the world feeling alienated, and isolated, and fucked up, and... and with a sense of not belonging. You grow up somewhere. It doesn't fit. It doesn't make sense. You don't feel real. You don't feel accepted. And then you get to part two of your life where you find that place that you belong. When Armistead described logical family to me, and I said, "Oh, you mean that thing that we've all been doing all our lives?" And he went, "Yeah." So many of us feel alienated from the people who brought us into the world. It can make you feel really isolated, desperate, unmoored in ways that you just don't... sometimes you just don't know are happening. So, the idea of logical family, I think really gives people an option to say I choose you. I call it extended family and that's what we do. My role in most of the extended family is auntie or granny. More and more these days, people are aware that that's what they need to get through life, people who, of like mind, who love and support you. I would say that Armistead has told stories that make you want to tell your story. He made characters who were like people you know, and you wanted to tell them in turn what you hadn't been able to say, or what your back story was. Tell me again about those Gatsby eyes. He allowed people to be truthful, and to know why it was important to be truthful beyond themselves. My career has had a very slow unfolding, and the story I've told has kept ongoing for 40 years, and people are finding it. A writer's life has ups and downs, and there's not a whole lot of money flow going on right now. It was a real lesson for me to move into our current ground level flat in a Victorian house in the Castro. I don't mind being back in a sort of Mary Ann Singleton situation where I can hear the people going up the steps to the flat above. Have a good weekend? I've had a hard time distinguishing between yearning for my own youth and yearning for the old San Francisco. This is still the most beautiful place in the world to me, and where I want to be. It still has an enchanted feel to it. Times change. Herb Caen, who was the great columnist when I was a young man here, was always grumping about how things were so much better back in the '30s and '40s. Well, you were young then, Herb, and you know, and I was young in the '70s and '80s. And they were lovely, but here we are, and I'm fucking lucky to be alive. That's what I keep coming back to. I'm so lucky to be alive. I don't have friends who could be here with me, and have the luxury of griping about the Google bus. They are long gone. And so, I try to live my life for them. It was so cool to see Donna there. Let me show you this window. - Have you seen this? - Oh, no. It's great. Now, that's just so great. Stay visible. Should we... Go get a Dapper Dog? Dapper Dog. - A little sustenance... - Yeah. - ...after your show. - Yeah. - That was great. - Oh, thanks, baby.
