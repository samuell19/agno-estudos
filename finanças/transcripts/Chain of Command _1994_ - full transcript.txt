Who the hell are you and what the hell is going on here? Now you seem like a nice guy. Got yourself all worked up. It's okay. You would be, Carter? I'm not gonna tell you... -That you, Mr Carter? -Yes. Yes! That's good. That's a good positive mental attitude. I like that. Get him the hell out of here. That's one of them. Alright, folks. Will the following U.S. personnel please, kindly step forward. When I call your name. Archer. Come on! Kujenski. Ross. Ross? Stations' under terrorist attack. This is Merrill Ross calling. Merrill Ross. -Merrill Ross? -He's gone. He's gone? Well do tell, boy. He got a telegram. His father died. Took a jeep, drove back to base camp. -To make a 447 flight out of here. -Poor guy. -Winston, huh? -Go to hell. Now, now, watch your language. Come join the fun, huh? Take them back to the truck! Let's go! Come on! Let's go, move! Move! Come on. Let's go. Move! Move. Hurry up. Don't look back. Don't look back. The following personnel, not essential. All the one's left, kill them. Are you saying there is a terrorist attack at Western Station Seven? -Say again station seven. -Affirmative, probable hostage situation. I repeat, probable hostage situation. Fire! Alright gentleman! -Let's go! Everybody. On the truck. -Hurry, hurry, hurry. Go, go. Let's go. Oh, Mr Ross. Please. Please. I am Colonel Hakkim. Head of the secret police, right? I prefer Chief of Qumiri Intelligence, but as you wish. Now I have a few questions for you Mr Ross. Look... In the last five hours I told my story to a Sargent, a Lieutenant, two Captains, and some guy who was a head janitor for all I know. I demand to make a phone call to the US Embassy, and I want it now. Please let's relax, Mr Ross. Your Embassy has already been informed of your safety... ...as has the CEO of Western Oil, Mr Benjamin Brewster. Now, do you recognize this man? -Yeah, that's him. -His name is Rawlings. And those he led, they were Qumiri Liberation Initiative, right? How should I know if they were the QLI? You said some carried American weapons. Are you sure? I did two hitches in the US Army. I'd say I'd know an M-16 when I'd seen one. Ah, yes, Mr Ross. Your record is pretty impressive. A Green Beret. Special training for anti-terrorist operations. Military Intelligence, honorable discharge as a Captain... ...and now working for Western Oil as a technical advisor. Uh, you're well-informed. That is my profession. I'm curious to know Mr Ross, why does a man like you decide to devote his life to a job like this? Isn't it rather tame? Not that it's any of your business, Colonel, but I've been in the army since I was 18 years old. I saw a lot of action, and a lot of killing. So maybe tame was just what I was looking for. What a pity you did not succeed in finding it. Your entitled to your own opinion. I have arranged a room for you at the Hotel Paradise. A driver will take you there. Stay in your Hotel room, Mr Ross. Well why would I want to do that? We have a reason to believe Mr Rawlings is working for the CIA. The CIA does not care for witnesses. At least not live ones. I'll keep that in mind. Colonel. Alright! Alright, alright! Keep your pants on. You keep yours on too, Mr Ross. Call me Maya. May I come in? Your company sent this over for you. It was at the front desk. You work for Ben Brewster? I don't work for Western Oil, Mr Ross. -I'm your Uncle Sam. -My have you changed. You'd better change too, Mr Ross. I wasn't expecting guests. Maya, it's a nice name. What's your last one? People in my business don't give last names. -I'm a spook. -A what? It's a trade term. I'm with the company, you know, Central Intelligence. -Baloney. -No, really its true. What? Do you want to see my secret decoder ring? Look, if your serious. I'm dead serious Mr Ross. Merrill. -Look. -No, you look, Merrill. You had a little chat with Colonel Hakkim, this morning. We'd like to know what came up in this conversation. Among other things. Uh, Hakkim said the CIA wants me dead. We, just might. If we believe this. Nice likeness, but I'm afraid my Arabic's a little rusty. It quotes you saying that the QLI staged the raid. -And that it was led by a CIA agent. -Huh, really? -I never said anything.... -Maybe so, but the QLI wont buy it. They're not going to like people thinking their playing footsies with infidel spies. -The employ of the Great Satan. -Footsies? So the question is... are you gonna to play ball? -You travel in style. -Well, isn't that the American way? -After you. -Thank you. Mr Ross. Excuse me, but you seem to be standing between where I am, and where I want to go. I think it would be better, if you returned to your room... I'm Stephanie Harris from the U.S. State Department. Now Ambassador Mosby would like to see Mr Ross right away. I'm sure that Colonel Hakkim, would not like to interfere with any official Embassy business. You will return to your room and take this girl with you. Look, I can prove who I am. I have a diplomatic passport here somewhere. Get in the car Mr Ross. Your now a prisoner of the Qumiri Liberation Initiative. Move it! Come on let's go! What happened to the cutesy college girl manners? The blood of the my suffering Arab brothers and sisters washed them clean away. Why did you lie about us? I don't know what the hell your talking about. We know you say it. We took help from your CIA. That is a lie. And I don't give a rat's ass what you know. But for the record I never said anything about the QLI, the CIA or the KG and B. You want to shoot me, go ahead and freaking shoot me. He's useless. I say we kill him. No, we take him with us as planned. Soon, we will free your people. You will be a witness and you will tell the truth. If you lie again, I personally rip your balls of with my bare hands, and you will watch me feed them to my dogs. Now, what to do you say to that Mr Smart Ass American pig? Ditto. I suppose you have a plan? We kill the enemies of Qumiri, and free the western scum they're holding. And if you don't kill the enemies of Qumiri fast enough, won't they smoke the hostages, huh? Probably, we would. -Untie me, I'm going with you. -You will wait in the truck. I thought you wanted a witness. What am I supposed to see from in there? He's right. -I don't think, we should risk... -Do you question my orders? Yeah, do you question his orders? If he shows the slightest sign of treachery, shoot him. My pleasure. -Achmed! -Greetings. Be careful! Be careful! -Ebraham, throw a grenade! -I do not have another. Just what I like, planning and frigging foresight. Do you think weapons grow on our olive trees, Ross? We fight with what we have. Damn it. Cover me. Drop it, Ross. Look, right now we all want the same thing, and you could use another man. So let's go. No! I said no, damn it! Ross! Ross! What are you doing? Answer me! Come on, we can't wait any longer. Merrill! Time for a little barbecue. Cover me! Let's go! Fuck! Mini-gun. -Designed for... -Military aircraft. Die American dog! -Clear! -Clear! -Carter! -God damn it Merrill! I'm glad to see you! I thought you bought it at the station. No such luck. Looks like you'll have to pay me that twenty you owe me, huh? -Hey guys! -Who're your friends? -QLI. -You must be kidding. Does it look like I'm kidding? -Who killed this man? -That'd be me. -Fool. I had questions for him. -Felt good. You've been freed by the blood of the Qumiri Liberation Initiative. The QLI had no hand in your capture, and no help from the dogs of the CIA. -Do you understand this? -Right. Good. We go now. You fought well, almost like an Arab. I say it was just dumb luck. Aren't you ever satisfied? Let's go! Move it! Come on. Thank you, Ross. Glad to see you could make it, Atkins. Damn hard to find good help these days. This is the fort, from which just a few hours ago, the hostages taken from a desert Western Oil Facility were rescued by an unidentified armed force. The location of the four hostages, and according to some reports a fifth American... ...remains unknown at this time. That would be Ross, Mr Brewster. Both the US State Department and the Qumiri government have promised to enter a statement, but so far, we have no more information. Barry Lavious, the Republic of Quimir. -What's going on with our hostages? -I'm not sure, sir. The Qumiri solders turned them over to the U.S. Embassy. That's all I've been able to find out. -Well, have you talked to the Embassy yet? -Their stonewalling. Wouldn't it be nice if their was just one idiot over at that God damn Embassy, that knew his ass from a hole in the ground. Get that bastard, Mosby, on the horn. Well, sometime this Goddamn week, Atkins. Yes, sir. Checkpoint six, report your status. Checkpoint six, all clear. No problem, Mr Brewster... ...your people are just about out of debriefing. Of course, were not holding them in communicado, we just need to get our stories straight first. That's all. That's right. Oh, no need to mention it Ben, anytime. You have a nice day too, bye. So, Station Chief Linder. Let me see if I understand your story. First the QLI captures five Americans. Then massacres themselves fighting against themselves... ...trying to set these same Americans free! Right? -Well, actually... -Except, I'm leaving off the best part. First, QLI is helped, by an American. The Qumiri press says the CIA... ...and then later by another American, ex-special forces captain, named, Merrill Ross. The hostages report, that both their captors and the rescuers... ...identified themselves as QLI. But we're still evaluating the possibility that both the... Evaluate this Linder. Quimir is one of the few governments in this part of the world... ...that is even remotely friendly to the United States. And you know about that announcement they were gonna make, don't you? Yes, but, we can't conduct an investigation... Now! What is this ridiculous story of your going to do to our relations? And more to the point, what the frig is going on here? I don't know sir. Are you gonna do something about it? Or just read about it in the Qumiri newspapers. We'll fly the hostages out tomorrow. They wont see or talk to anyhow until then. We'll take a floor at the Hotel Paradise, and we'll put airtight security on it. -What else? -This Captain Ross... I wouldn't buy his story if Mother Theresa told it to me. We'll get him back to CIA Langley and we'll get your answer's sir. If we have to drag it out of him. Right. -Any traffic on your floor? -Negative. What can we do about the air conditioning? -Request that transfer to Alaska. -Copy that. Carter. Carter! Why aren't you dead? -Why ain't you in your own room asleep? -No, really? Hostages are usually shot when there's a rescue attempt, and they had plenty of time to do that. Guys who don't let other guys sleep are usually shot too. Your not listening, Carter. Thanks, Ross. That's what a need, a nice one hundred and ten degree desert breeze. Will you go the hell to your room, please? Yeah, I've been running around, but the devil's down. I got you hot shot. It doesn't make any sense, any of it. And, why did Winston kill that guy? Maybe you noticed, the guy's a nutcase, okay? Now will you please go beddy-bye? We've got a long trip home tomorrow, and I want to get my beauty sleep. -No, I'm staying, beautiful. -Okay. Stay. -But not in my damn room. -You know you're no fun anymore. As of right now, our engagement is off. Fine by me, but I keep the ring. -Getting like a teddy bear. -Hold it! -Step two, step is a tricky one down there. -Freeze! Right there. This is the wrong floor, sir. Wait. Wait a minute, you guys, uh, uh, Secret Service or something, right? Traffic on the floor negative. No threat. Hey, what's going on? Is uh, Elvis here? Hey, look, its cool, your secret's safe with me. Alright? Well, if you'll excuse me, I gotta... Just return to your floor, and there'll be no trouble. Trouble? What do you mean trouble, this is my floor. Look, I just want to try to get a little rest, that's all. -I got a key. -Oh, its right here really. Yeah, right. I had a long night, boys. Yeah, keys. Hah, beautiful. -False alarm. Traffic all clear. -Copy that. Wake up friend. Where's Ross? You dirty son of a.... You are one dumb bastard. You know that, friend? Sleep tight. Run little bunny, run little bunny. You hoo, here I come! Out of my way! -Don't move, mister, or I'll shoot! -No, no, no! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! I'm on your side. Get down! Security! -You look like your in trouble, huh? -Get out of here! Move! Go! Okay, I'm going. I'm going! Okay, let's go! Ah, you lucky son of a bitch. You know, man? You look just like your picture. Don't worry everything is cool drool. Maybe you shouldn't stay in this hotel anymore. Trust me, I'm your friend. Hey, air tight security, my ass. -Sorry, Sir. -Where's Merrill Ross? We know he doesn't have any contacts in the city. He's got no where to go. We put surveillance on the airports, bus stations, train stations, all western style hotels. He's bound to surface soon. -Linder. -Yes, sir. I don't wanna wait for him to surface. I want you to find him! -Is that clear? -Yes, sir. Clear, sir. You have caused me a great deal of embarrassment. Do you have any idea how awkward it was for me... ...to explain this to the military authorities? Yeah, I guess things got a little messy. You killed the wrong man. You leave four CIA corpses. The military is upset. Ambassador Mosby is upset. And Doctor Azil is upset. I have to meet him in two hours and he'll want answers. And all you can say, "It got a little messy." You fouled up. Yea, I guess your right. Things got really messy. Oh, buy the way, Hakkim. Do you have any decent vodka you could put in this drink for me? Hakkim. No, sir. No, it is not my fault. Remember, Rawlings is your man, not mine. No, there Is no reason for panic, sir. That will not be necessary. We can proceed with your plan as scheduled. He wants to talk to you. Sure. Ambassador Mosby. I believe I asked you to bring a representative of your Central Intelligence Agency to this meeting. As you know Mr President, there are no CIA personnel on my staff. Your, CIA Chief of Station for Qumiri, is Eric Linder. Mr Linder is our passport officer, as your well aware Colonel. Four of the dead men at the hotel were CIA agents. -Those men were embassy security. -Liar. I can give you the names of each one of those. -The military knows that your... -This is not the time or the place. Gentleman! Mr Mosby, my country wishes to remain friendly to yours. But, we will not tolerate any interference in our internal affairs... ...by your Embassy security. -Do I make myself clear? -Perfectly sir. And I am authorized to tell you that my government... ...had absolutely nothing to do with these unfortunate incidents. I would like to believe you. In any case these occurrences have caused a great deal of unrest in Quimir. It might be better if I postponed announcement of resolution fifty-seven. I assure you my government does not want any delays. I agree. Then we must proceed. Then we all agree. But first we need to find who is behind this unrest. Qumiri intelligence will disclose all information it has obtained... ...on the Western Oil incidents to Mr Mosby's staff. You, ambassador, will provide what information you possess to Colonel Hakkim. You will cooperate and you will seek the truth together. I can not announce resolution fifty-seven, until this situation is stable. Dr. Azil, you can not expect me to release classified information to these men. Is your government friendly to us, or not? -Of course it's friendly. -Good. I now present you with an excellent opportunity to prove it. Good afternoon. Nice music. Thank you, I like American Jazz. You know, if I have time I play American Jazz. But now, I was like faking' it. I must start doing some serious practicing. Look, uh, thanks for letting me grab some sleep, Achmed, but I gotta get going. Chill Bro, you owe me like seven dollar and fifty cent, American, for the fare. -You remember, in the cab? -I owe you a lot more than that, Achmed. -Forget it. You got a place to crash? -Not really. I have idea. You look like crap, and you smell like crap, you look tired. You go cop a shower. And after that... I make you good food, I give you good music. Trust me. It's a very safe place. I tell you, it's a very safe place. Sir, it is absolutely impossible for me... ...to release agency files to the Qumiri intelligence. Now then, Station Chief Linder. Do you not see this phone? Well not more than, five, minutes ago, I was on this phone. And on another phone, a couple of, thousand miles away. Was the President of the United States. And he said, "Dwayne." Did you know he calls me Dwayne? He said Dwayne, I want Doctor Azil to be happy. And I want you to make Doctor Azil happy. Now. What do you think will make Doctor Azil happy? A cupcake? A twinkie? A bigwheel? No! Its that you'll cooperate with his frigging secret police. Do you get it, Linder? I got it, sir. Good. Hey, don't you ever wear any cloths? Maya. Or what are you calling yourself today? I don't know. I'm kinda torn between, Aleshia. Felecia. -Surprised to see me? -Not really. Should of known you were playing me like a flute. -Don't be so rough on yourself. -Speaking of rough... How's your hand-to-hand combat, Maya? Gee, not too shabby. Not to shabby at all, Merrill. But you out-weigh me. Unfair advantage, you see. So... What's up for tonight? Blowing up the US Embassy? Not really. I came to talk. I suppose Achmed's part of your sunshine brigade. Achmed's not with the QLI and neither am I. Still a CIA spook? I'm with Moussad, Israeli foreign intelligence. Ah, you're good. -Real good. I'll give you that. -Don't believe me? Here. I've seen this trick before. No tricks. Achmed's waiting in the other room. If you don't believe our story, shoot us. You're a first class chump if you think I wont. Well... What's life without taking a few chances? Please, please. Please. Ladies and Gentlemen, please. Soon, I will allow you to question these unfortunate victims of this aggression. We have been cooperating with the American Government in our investigation, but I am afraid we have come to a most unpleasant conclusion. This attack, and the fraudulent, staged, rescue that followed was perpetrated by the Qumiri Liberation Initiative. For reasons we do not yet understand, the QLI was assisted in terms of funds, weaponry, and personnel by the American Central Intelligence Agency. I'm going to kill this son of a bitch. This man, Merrill Ross, an American who escaped this attack, and who we believe was assassinated by the CIA. And all of the hostages have identified this man, as the leader of the attack. His name is Lanford P. Rawlings. An agent of the CIA who has served in Nicaragua, Laos, Cambodia and El Salvador. Rawlings went out the gate in 88. How did Hakkim get a hold of that stuff? Because Rawlings must have told him, you simpleton. Press kits with photos and documentation, will be available after this conference. Questions please? Colonel, can you substantiate the charges of collusion between the CIA and QLI? Give me Washington, priority one, and scramble. So, the bottom line is Maya, you can't prove squat. Merrill, in the next few days Mohammed Azil will announce resolution 57... ...that Quimir recognizes the existence of the state of Israel, and all diplomatic relations will be opened. And when he does man, this whole country is going to go ballistic. I mean the CIA QLI plot, has been totally manufactured. Why? Because somebody wants to march in and take over the country for themselves, without having a civil war. -What's this got to do with me? -We don't know. I mean you, probably just got in the way. But somebody is afraid of you and wants you dead. We want to get you to Tel Aviv. Not till I finish some business with my friend Rawlings. I was afraid you were going to say that. -What's this? -I'm sorry brew. Put it down, Achmed. -Put it down! -I'm very sorry. Put it down. Put it down, Achmed! I decided you really didn't need a firing pin, darling. Now we go for a nice little car ride. And then a nice little plane ride. Evening folks. This boy kinda grows on ya after a while, doesn't he? Well, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but uh, this party's coming to an end. Come on. Come one man, let see how tuff you are. -You've got to be frigging kidding me. -No. Hello, Merrill. Come on in. Have a chair. You smoke cigars? Suit yourself. I'm Ben Brewster, CEO of Western Oil. We met when you came in country, remember? Brewster. Ben, son. Just call me Ben. I've had my eye on you for quite some time now. Look, how the hell did I, get here? Ah, your all right now. Now your just fine. Your in the computer complex of our corporate headquarters here. What about Maya? Well, son, she's being looked after. You'll just have to trust me on that one. Trust. Now, if you'll just hold your questions for a little while, I've got something I want you to see. This man Merrill Ross, an American who escaped this attack, and whom we believe was assassinated by the CIA... ...and all of the hostages have identified, this man, as the leader of the attack. He is Lanford P. Rawlings. Yeah, I've got a buddy with a hat just like it. Is it beaver? Damn right it's a beaver. Watch your head there son. I don't buy cheap hats. Try it on. Hell, if it fits, take it on home with you tonight. -Don't fit. -Wouldn't you know it? Well, this is the wine cellar. This is where I come when I need to relax. They tell me it's a, an old Roman cistern of some sort. -Come on in, watch your step, there. -You are one cowpoke. You bet, I'm from Texas, son. I love to collect things. I don't know what it is, but I just love it. Yeah, I can see that. Nice table. I took a half million dollars away from the Shah on this table one night, son. No kidding? Yes sir, they called it the mother of all pool games. -What's with the pink ball? -Hell, I haven't the slightest idea. I know it's one thing I know. I know It's time for my drink here, buddy. Nice bar. I normally have a shot of warm Bombay Rum with a human pubic hair in it, but... ...out of pubic hairs. How bout yourself? No thanks, I'll stick with my smokes. If I can find my lighter. Tell me something Ben. -Is Rawlings working for Hakkim, or what? -Not necessarily. Here's the deal, hostages won't be able to say a thing that'll contradict Hakkim. Hell if they do, Winston will tell them the story the way we want. That's why we planted him, just in case. So Winston killed that guard so he wouldn't tell a different story, huh? Slick. -So you work for Hakkim right? -Wrong! Hakkim, works for us. Along with Rawlings, and his highly trained, highly paid, group of Arab mercenaries. Us? Western Oil Corporation, son. That's been our operation all along. Your not going to try anything heroic here are you? Why, hell no Ben, keep talking. -Hell, I won't even need this then will I? -No, siree. Here's the deal. I am evolving the idea of a corporate take-over, one step further, simple as that. Now Hakkim is nothing more than a figure head. He'll keep the natives happy... ...and I will have collected my own private little Arab country. Western will control the prices of oil at the well heads. As well as the pumps in the states. Its worth billions, and the long run, maybe trillions. -You killed their own people, Ben. -Well, it was necessary. Nothing personal, just business. -And what do you want from me? -Well, a lot. Later on after we take over, but for now a nice little video tape in which you say. The CIA has been trying to kill you because you know of their connections with the QLI. -And what do I get out of it? -What do you want, son? Merit badge? Money son, you get money! -Great, green, sweet stacks of money. -Money. Now, let me get this straight. If I say no, you have me killed, right? Well. Unfortunately, yes. But if I say, yes, I get a yacht, a Ferrari, date with Michelle Pfeiffer whatever, right? Yes, to that too. -I'm no chump, I'm with you Ben. -Good, good! -Now, there's just one small problem. -What's that Ben? I need to confirm the sincerity of your greed. Okay, bring her on in boys. You better be playing this straight with me compadre. Come on in honey, join the party. Who is this lovely little flower of the East, anyway? Merrill, don't say anything. I don't know Ben. She call's herself Maya. She tells a lot a funny stories. You know, QLI, CIA, Moussad spy. You take your pick. Well now that's, that's real interesting isn't it? Why don't you just. Why don't you just kill her? -Kill her? -Yeah. Sorry, Maya. Nothing personal, right Ben? Just business. There are no words for what I feel for you. All right, well done. Outstanding. Now, were gonna keep Maya around a little while longer, because we want to find out a little bit more about her. And we will when Rawlings, gets back. Oh, he can be very persuasive. Meanwhile, you may need to get a little shut eye. We've got a real busy schedule tomorrow. -Watch your step, Ben. -You bet. You know, I knew from the very start that you were interested in this program. Watch your head. I got some good news. I got some bad news. Which would you like to hear first? What's the matter honey? Cat got you tongue? Alright, the bad news is your are going to die, but, hmm. Its not going to be with a bullet to the head. Nothing that simple. But the good news... Aw, the good news. This. This could go on for days. I just hope you enjoy it as much as I do, is all. Thank you. What do you want? -Brewster thinks I need a baby sitter? -I said, what do you want? -A match, a light, fire, zippo, oh a... -Ah, zippo, yeah. Zippo. Okay, highest priority files. Right. Quimir Incorporated. Western Oil corporation proposed take over Republic of Quimir. See extended files. Timetables. Profit projection. Government officials as personnel. Floppy disk, floppy disk. Put it here. Copy, come on copy. This should make interesting reading. The human body is a very interesting thing. There's lots of sensitive areas. Where you wouldn't even figure. Like right here of instance. The belly button, huh? I'll kill you! We'll work up to the good places. Real slow like, okay? Get away! No, no, no, no... Ace! Just in the nick of time. Come, come join the party we're just having a little fun here. Yeah, that's right, shoot me. And about thirty armed guards will be down in nothing flat. You'll never see tomorrow. -Kill him! -Uh, take you best shot. You know, we could have a little more fun with your girlfriend if you like. Ross! Ross! Wait, that's a good move. What is that? Uh, Green Beret? You know what I hate about this the most, pretty boy? I gotta waste a good cigar. That's all you got? Didn't they teach you anything at Fort Benning, boy? Come on. Ross, that's it. Mother uh! Come on, that's it. Come on, come on. Come her buddy, I'm not done with you yet baby. Say good night, pretty boy. Son of a bitch, come on. -I hate you! I'm going to kill you! -How's your boyfriend look now, honey? -How's your boyfriend look now? -Get out of here, pig! My momma told me there'd be days like this. But, she didn't tell you about this one. Hey, remember me? Merrill, come on untie me already. -Come on! -Nag, nag, nag. You fought well. Almost like an Israeli. -What's this for? -For last night. You could of shot me. I didn't think Brewster would give me a loaded piece if he wasn't sure of me, okay? Yeah, right. -Come on, we need to get some information. -Is this what your looking for? Brewster's whole deal right here. No! -Anything moves, kill it. -No problem. Hey, Ross. -Your good. Real good. -Ditto. Kill them! -I'm very disappointed in you, Hoss. -We've got the files Ben, its over. That ain't nothing over, buddy boy. You'll never get outta here. Oh, yes we will, Ben. Because, you're gonna take us there. -Don't shoot or I'll blow his head off. -Hold your fire. Hold your fire -I said nobody! Move it! -Hold them up, hold them up! Move it! Don't let the them out, don't let them out. -Out of my way. -Hold your fire. Move it! -Truck. -No, helicopter. -Move, Hoss! -Hold em up! I said move it! Don't let them get away! Keep them in your sight. No one fires, until I give the command. No frigging tricks, maggot brain. Sit on your hands! Sit on your hands! Sit on them. Look, we can still make a deal here. You move and I'll blow your freaking head off. You understand? You sure you can fly this thing, Maya? Of course, every agent at my level went to flight school. We can still cut a deal, I can call these men off. -Million's of dollars, think about it. -Shut up! One move and I’ll blow his head off. This is the collective, this is the cyclic. Or, is it the other way around? Maya, I don't like what I'm hearing over here. The collective, the cilliat, the da, da, da, come on! Will you just relax, okay? I'm just a little rusty. -A little? -Yes, a little. No big deal here. -You need a manual? -Alright already! The starter right there, just push the button. -Good. -Never mind me, just kill him! Officers, just open fire! Merrill, other side. Other side! All stand by, get together on the double. Move, move! Come on, hurry. Move it. -Come on let's go. -OK, let's go. Come on. Hit it. No problem. Tell me, what exactly are you? -CIA? Military intelligence? -Your getting warm. Getting warm. Tell me something. -Is Maya, your real name? -Of course. Of course, and what's your last one? Well, that's kinda complicated. So let's just stick to Maya. I heard it was, uh, Rabinowitz. -Your getting warm. -Getting warm. Listen Merrill, after you turn Brewster... ...and the floppy disk over to Ambassador Mosby. What do you say to a little R&R with me? -Rest and Recreation? -Maybe not that much rest. Ross and Rabinowitz, that's alright Maya? -Rabinowitz and Ross. -What's life without taking a few chances.
