Subtitles by explosiveskull Sanders. Yeah. What's the address? I've known they approved you for active duty for a day or so. Couldn't say anything. Look, Riley. Not everyone comes back from something like that. I'm fine, sir. Abducted, tortured? Are you willing? Are you... I'm just acknowledging that. Okay. Anyway, you have a new partner. Paul Carr. Seven years homicide, Wasatch County. That's him. - Come on in, Paul. - Morning, Lieutenant. Riley, Paul. Hey. Paul's been working with us for about three weeks. I think this is a good pairing. Looking forward to it. All right. Paul's going to get you up to date on the current cases. Good to have you back, Detective. You don't have to talk about it. I haven't read the report. I don't need to know what happened. But if you ever do want to talk about it, I know you were... How about you tell me about the current cases? Right. Couple things. Stabbing outside city creek. Older woman. Looks like a mugging. Um, here's a strange one. We found a man locked inside a dark room, dead of a heart attack. It was a while back. A couple weeks ago. He locked himself in? No. Door had an external padlock. Was there any sign of a struggle? The man was bound to a chair. No fingerprints. He was a loner. Stayed inside. No family, few friends. We got nothing. Can I take a look at the file? Please help... Are you willing? Morning. What have we got here? Dead body. That's all I know. Her stuff's in the other room. Couch, lamps. It's just like eight lamps. Who has eight lamps? Someone afraid of the dark. You know, this took a lot to do. I painted my place a month ago, and it took me all weekend. What's her name? Name? Ask him. Kimberly Parker. What happened? She had a heart attack. Who was F.O.S.? Again. I was, ma'am. Neighbor usually brings the victim in her mail. When she wasn't answering, neighbor called it in. All right. Thank you. Someone binds her up like that and paints the entire room red? No. None of it's on her. It was dry when she was placed here. What's that? It's a dressing. It's fresh. Must've been a struggle. Yeah. She fought back, got hurt, and someone bandaged her and chained her up. How fresh is it? Within 24 hours. Why dress the wound? And what's the point of all the red? Well, I once had a body with a teddy bear sewed up inside it. You can't make sense of the senseless. Why is this entire room red? I'm supposed to have guesses on that? The address is different on her license. Let's check it out. Yeah, well... I'm so sorry. She was afraid of people, things. The... The out there. She wouldn't leave her place alone, even around the block. But sometimes, I would, I would take her outside to get some fresh air. Blindfolded. Blindfolded? If she saw the color red, she panicked. It was... frightening. Why? Well, there's this condition that the mind can't perceive color. It's monochromacy. Color is an illusion. It's not real. My red and your red aren't the same. We all think we're seeing color the same, but we're not. Everything is perception. It's... essentially meaningless. I'm sorry. Did she have this? No. She suffers... Uh, she had chronic phobia. Erythrophobia. It's the fear of the color red. Did she ever see anyone for this condition? There's a doctor. I took her. There's a program. She said she was special. That these people, these phobics... I mean, you have no idea. Do you have the name of this doctor? She wasn't normal. But she was my daughter. Was it suicide? It doesn't appear to be. Thank you for your time. Give it! Don't hurt him! Don't. Shh. No one's gonna hurt you. What are you doing here? I'm Detective Sanders. This is Detective Carr. We'd like to ask you some questions about one of your patients. That was interesting. Phobias are crippling. What I do here is a last resort for people. They come here when they have nowhere else to turn. Like Kimberly Parker? She is my patient and also a subject in a restricted sponsored study. Was. Someone painted her walls red. She was found dead, chained to a chair. You think of any reason someone would paint her walls like that? Yes, if they wanted to hurt her. Can we see your files? What's this? Rorschach test cards. What do you see? Nothing. You show a phobic Rorschach test, and they inevitably see their fear in the inkblots. What they see reveals their fear over and over. So? What do you see, Detective? Just a bunch of ink. And the files? Unfortunately, that's all I can say. I figured as much. There's some weird phobias out there. Lachenophobia: fear of vegetables. I mean, never been a fan of celery, but I can't see one stalking me. Really? That's it? Mm-hmm. Wow. I worked on that last night. Told it to my mom. Yeah? How'd that play? Much better. Yeah? That's cool. She has a sense of humor. So I had a thought. Mm, is this like a celery bit? No. That night of your incident. I read your file. Great. You were in peril and... I was in peril? Is this another thing you tried out on your mom? Come on. You know what I mean. You were in danger, and you were restrained. Reminds me of Kimberly Parker's murder. Kimberly Parker was found in a room painted red, bound to a chair. Restrained like you were. Look, there was nothing in your file. Was there something else that happened to you that night? Was there something else in the room? Did he do anything to you? What happened to me was its own thing. I mean, really, if anything, the Kimberly Parker case is more like that case that you told me about with the guy that was locked in the room. Yeah. I got this. Let me see that. Salt Lake PD? My father. He was shot in the line of duty. They gave the watch to my mother. She gave it to me when I made detective. I'm sorry. Paul, look at me. I'm really sorry. He knew your dad. Yeah? Yeah. I mean, they weren't close or anything, but yeah. I know I want to have you over for dinner. I got this. All right. Yeah, I understand. Thank you. Nothing. Well, these files that she gave us have nothing in them. Just names and redacted records. I know. No way. Samuel Leslie. That was our case. Wasn't that the guy that was in the locked room? Yeah. What was this fear? Darkness. I told you it was similar. You did. She obviously knew that he died, and she didn't say anything to us about it. Yep. Some of this stuff is fascinating. She transfers their fear from whatever it is they're afraid of to something totally different, like a bell or lights. What do you mean, lights? It says they use a white light with a repeater. Guessing that's like a strobe. Anyway, after that, they... no longer afraid of dogs or sharks or whatever. It's the bells or lights. That's the theory, anyway. One of the files mentions "crisis-powered physiological enhancement phenomenon." You heard of that one? What? Oh. It's also called "excited delirium," like when a mom lifts a car off her kid. Yeah, that's not a real thing. Yeah, but there's a ton of stuff on the Internet about it. This woman protected her children from a polar bear attack. Stuff like that. You know what else is on the Internet? - Stories about Bloody Mary. - Who? Where you look in the mirror and say Bloody Mary three times. I guess I missed that one. What happens? She, uh... She appears. Anyway, it's all urban legend. Get me some of that. Can you put that here? Detective. - What happened to the lights? - Somebody cut the power. Whoever did this brought their own lights. Hey, can you hold off on that? What happened to his face? Well, I found bits of cornea underneath his fingernails. I think, I mean as far as I can see, he was trying to scratch his eyes out. I've never seen anything like this. What is this, panic? I don't know. What is that? Book of phobias. Pediaphobia: fear of dolls and mannequins. I don't blame him. Any other injuries? Nothing like the first victim. No bandages, no defensive wounds. Holden. We need to get a list of everyone in her program. Yeah. Please. Please help. Your father was a few years behind me at the academy, but I remember him. Terrible tragedy what happened. I carry it with me. Hmm. It's nice. It's very nice. You should be proud. He was one of the good guys. He thought fondly of you as well. He gave me that book they wrote about you. Had a huge impact on my life, sir. How did you know? Hmm? The man you shot. Mm. How did you know he wasn't the husband? When I went to the door, I asked to speak to the wife. When she came out, said it was just a dumb argument. We turned to go back inside. It was, uh, it was the way touched her. You know, you could tell. Yeah, the author of the book tried to sell that as police instinct. Afraid that was just dumb luck. I mean, I drew my service revolver and fired a millisecond before I felt his round crashing in my leg. Do you know what they found in his house? The one he shot? Really? Just what was in the book. There were horrible things. Things with children. The kind of things that you would never imagine, unless you saw them. The evil men do. I'm sorry. What was that? There are people, men who have urges, compulsions, and you could understand their crimes. I mean, not the deeds they do, but you can understand why they do things and the psychology. But men like the one I shot isn't afflicted by weakness or an urge. It's methodical. It's who they are. And I knew there were thousands like him. If I got them all, it wouldn't matter because they keep coming, like the plague. That's what I thought back then, so I quit. What? In that moment, I told Riles she'd never have to spend another night in a hospital. Not with me, anyway. And she says, "Daddy, if you quit, who's gonna catch the bad guys?" Fear is paralyzing. And I knew it was fear feeding on me. I knew the only thing more powerful in this world than fear was hope. So I let hope in, and I stayed on and... I could see it. Brief moments when fear would, would all but fade away. When Riley asked who would do this job if I didn't, something clicked. I saw things in a way I never had. I mean, just as there'd always be men like the one I shot, there'd always be cops. Good cops. Like your dad, like you, like my Riles. Because someone has to do this job. I think it's bizarre you live in the house you grew up in and not your father. Why? I mean, he wanted to move for some reason, and... I just couldn't imagine anyone else living here. You know, the last gift my father gave me was your dad's book. I'm so sorry that you had to go through that, losing your dad. Strange thing being a cop, but I enjoyed listening to your dad talk about it. You're a lot like him. Don't patronize me. No, I mean... I think you should probably go. Why does that bother you... when I say you're like your father? Paul... I know you're killing yourself over what happened that night. Nobody is as wound as tight as you are without there being more to it. The thing about my dad, that night that he saved that family, he showed no fear. Or maybe he got lucky. And I don't know what happened, but I don't believe for one second that it was your fault. Riley... what happened? I'm sorry. I think you should go. Yeah? - Informant called me. - Who? - Are you there? - Paul, what's going on? Said to come alone, but he said to call you. Paul, where are you? He knows what happened to you that night. He said to go to 353 Harley Street. Paul, stop. Pull over. I promise we'll figure this out. Paul. Paul! Stop. No! Please! Help me! Oh, my... Oh, no! Oh, stop! God! Oh, no! Please! No! Oh, God! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! What's the matter with him? He just needs some rest. He's at risk. All of your patients are. We've been looking for him. He's safe here. Are the rest of your patients here? This isn't an inpatient program. Someone's killing your patients. Another one was murdered last night. I know. I am not leaving here without some answers. My research indicated a link between the reactions of clinical phobics and the phenomenon known as "excited delirium." Yeah, I've heard of that. It's like moms lifting cars off kids or fending off polar bears or whatever. - It's preposterous. - No, Riley. Do you understand the implications? Of what? Never being weak in any situation. Never being afraid of anything. Riley. Not the dark. Nothing ever again. Do you know something about me? What's the matter with me? Stop. Come with me. What is this? How are you sleeping? What? I'm sorry. I can't explain everything, Riley. But deep down, you know. You trying to get in my head? Look at that when you're alone. It's time for you to go now, Riley. I don't even know what you mean. Goodbye, Riley. Right, Sully? Get your story straight! Did we wake you? I'm hungry. Just grab some pizza in the kitchen. Help. Daddy. Hey, Sully, you down here? Daddy. - Where are you? - Over here! Daddy. Help me. I passed out. And when I woke up the next morning, you were gone. I couldn't find you anywhere. I called all my friends. When we checked all your friends' houses and then to the mall and the parks, everywhere, I couldn't find you anywhere, so I just, I came home, and... I just sat on that old blue sofa we used to have in the living room. I was so scared, Riley. I've never been more afraid in my entire life. I wanted the earth to swallow me. I was so ashamed. I was sure I'd lost you. Then I heard this scratching. Then I realized I'd been hearing it all along, but it didn't register until then. And this... this small flicker of hope trickled in. I stopped breathing and listened. I could hear it. In the kitchen, it was louder I went to the basement door... and down those stairs. When I saw you... I am so sorry. And that next night, you... you couldn't sleep. You'd have the lights on. And then you... you wet the bed. And that just went on and on. I mean, it was so hard on you. You were so afraid of the dark, I had to take you to a specialist. Holden. Yeah, Holden. And, uh, and she diagnosed you as... "Aclophobic." Extreme fear of the dark. And hypnophobic, fear of sleep. You were literally afraid to close your eyes. So I agreed to let her work with you. You saw her for about a month. And then... one night, you could sleep again. You never wet the bed, and... Holden assured me that, that you were cured. She, uh... she transferred my fears to this... flashing strobe light. I didn't know anything about any lights or anything like that. You never mentioned it. But it... it seemed like you blocked it out, you know? And... I was so ashamed, I never said anything about it again. And I... Eventually, I forgot. Time does that. I'm sorry. I had a moment today when I thought I was losing my mind. That I'd done things that I wasn't aware of. None of this is your fault. I love you. I love you. Daddy. I'm dying. Help. Help. Whoa! Riley, it's me. Were you in my backyard? What? Of course not. Riley, no. What's wrong? Somebody's in my garage. I got you. - Okay. - Let's go. That's not mine. This is more complicated than we thought. She's been at this for years. She's helped dozens of people with replacement therapy. Look at this. "Herta Ivanovich." From the Stalin era. Back when they were doing weird programs. Like that Nazis? Weirder. Stalin wanted to create a human-animal hybrid. Bizarre programs like that. They would put parents in sealed rooms, in front of a curtain, bind them to chairs... pull back the curtain, and their children would be behind a glass window, and they'd... do things to them. They were trying to see if they could break out. Did they? Doesn't say. Just trying to induce the crisis-powered physiological enhancement... yeah, polar bears. That's what they did to you, isn't it? But they never broke me. I'm fine. What if it were possible? The super human strength. It's not. That's crazy. Obviously somebody believes it. They keep doing these experiments. Yeah. Paul. Yeah? If you wouldn't have come tonight... I know. You think that's what he was trying to do with me? What do you mean? When he called me to that building. Got you there. You think he was going to put you behind the glass? Wait a minute. This is the building that I found you in. What? It's hard to tell 'cause it's an old photo, but that's the building. What's this doing in Holden's files? This place used to be owned by a company called Marks-Ferry. Holden? She sat on their board. Let's find a way in. Paul, I think this is the place I was treated when I was a kid. Are you sure? Hey. This is about them. Let's meet around back. If there's an open door, don't go in without me. I'm fine. All right. Dr. Holden? Dr. Holden, can you hear me? What's going on? I don't know. Is she okay? Put her down! Please. Put her down! Stop. Stop! What the hell? Don't hurt him! No! You could take your mask off. Your breathing. You're like me. Riley! Riley! Let her go, you son of a bitch! Riley! Riley! Paul... I know. Find her. Is this her? Yeah. It was a miracle. If she hadn't been there, Mikey... Can I have this? Yeah, sure. I was wondering if you could show me where it happened. Of course. You good? So the car slid off the road and landed somewhere, somewhere around here. Isn't that right, Mikey? Yeah, right here. Where did she come from? I wish I knew. I was so focused on Mikey and what she did because she... It wasn't possible. You didn't see where she came from? She was just there. She came out of the sky. Show me. Thanks. So is she... Is she in some kind of trouble? I just need to find her. Okay, who are you, really? I'm her friend. We want to thank her. If you find her, will you tell her, please? She's, um... She's pretty incredible. Absolutely. Thanks. And good luck. Let's go, bud. His regenerative capacity was greatly increased, but we were unable to save him. Preserve the brain. They'll want to study it, see how it worked. Of course. Any news on the other? Nothing yet. We need to find her before they do. This was all for her, wasn't it? Yes. All for Riley. Subtitles by explosiveskull
