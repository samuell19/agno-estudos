Kakei family. Thank you for coming. Want some? A bit, please. Here you are. Thank you for today. Things were tough for you, Eriko. She really spoiled Ma say a. She was proud of her grandchild. He's a bright lad. Ma say a, should I ask for more beverages? Ma say a! Where are you? I don't know. You decide. I can't by myself. Let's drink! Just order a couple more bottles. I understand. Come here. You've grown, Ma say a. How're you doing, boy? Well... You know. Thanks. Don't be shy. I hear you go to a university in Tokyo. You're a law student? No, I'm... Drink up. He seems upset. His mother died. And you, Mom? Are you relieved? Stop it. Ma say a, you'll be around for a while? I don't know. Why? The school will pay its respects to your grandmother. You won't come, right? I'm not welcome. Take it easy, Ma say a. She was the principal. The teachers and students will come, so... Certificate of Gratitude Ms. Sachie Kakei. It's alright. I won't go. Ma say a. Ma say a Kakei. Mr. Ma say a Kakei, it's my first time to write you. Do you remember me? When last we met, you said you would go to boarding school after jr. high. I was happy to hear you got into a famous prep school. You may think it weird to read in a letter suddenly, but I have a favor to ask of you. If possible, could you come and meet me? Yamato Haimura. For sale. That guy marched to the beat of his own drum. He'd leave at a certain time. Bakery Rochelle. He'd opened at a certain time. One chocolate pastry and one melon bread. That's 580 yen. Thank you, come again. Here's your coffee. Thank you. - Here you go. - Thank you. On the house. Really? - Because you study hard. - Thank you. What are you learning? English. It's my homework. I'm not very good. I wasn't either. - Really? - It's tough. Yeah. - Good luck. - Thank you. He set his sights on boys and girls of certain types and ages. He'd catch them in his certain way. Please, no! He'd torture them in his certain way. I'm sorry. Please... No... Forgive me. Please. In his certain way, he'd dispose of them. Good morning! Hey, good day. How are your cucumbers? I'll bring you some. Have a nice day! The police arrested him on suspicion of having murdered 23 juveniles and one adult female. Why did you only search around the smoke hut? Didn't you think she would report you? She was honest, pure, and smart. She'd surely rush to the police and testify reasonably and logically. Why did you think so? Why? My targets were all kids of that type. I change my question. You knew the police were coming and felt psychologically cornered, no? I've never been cornered. But you were arrested. Self-conceit caused that, not because the police were smart. What did it cause? Let's consider how Kierkegaard defined "despair." He claims it begins when people ignore their true selves. I sensed the people in town were unconcerned about their lives. Yamato Haimura. I was always trusted and never doubted. Their carelessness disgusted me. I felt somewhat silly since they were all like that. Ma say a? We went to the same jr. high. I'm Akari Kano. You remember? So, you go to this college. As for the escaped girl, I can explain that. Had she been my first, I'd have bound her more securely. There'd be no bodies in the garden. I'd burn them down to the bone and bury them. You mean, had you killed in your previous fashion, you'd have escaped arrest. Yes. If I could do it again, I'd never get caught. Lesson In Murder. Visitation application. Relationship: Acquaintance. Excuse me. Metal items are not allowed. Watches and phones must be left in a locker. Visitation number 87. Wait until your number appears on the monitor. Number 87, please proceed to the tenth floor. Long time no see, Ma-kun. You're no longer little "Ma-kun." No. I should call you Ma say a? Or, how about, Mr. Kakei? Ma say a is fine. Good. I'll call you Ma say a. You haven't changed at all. You used to come to my shop often. Yes. Thanks for coming. Sure. You're aware of what I've done? It was on the news and Internet... I'm sure it was. You know the details? The police said... I mean you... You killed 24 people. I... Were you doing that when I was visiting your shop? You wanted me... No, I didn't. You were too young at the time. I liked a certain type. 17 or 18-year-old, hard-working high school students. 15-year-old jr. high schoolers were no good. I see... You were sweet, Ma say a. You always ate a BLT at the counter of the shop. You'd come before cram school and wipe the counter after eating. "B. L. T. OJ." Good memories. I didn't expect you to be a... I didn't sense it at all. Yes, I felt so very calm when talking with you. I'm unsure why. When you and I talked, I felt like just another local baker. I've already been sentenced to death. I accept this decision. But there's one thing I can't accept. I was arrested for 24 murders. As you know, nine cases were pursued. Yes. But it wasn't me who committed the ninth case. - That means? - Visitation's over. I mean, somebody besides me is responsible. I admit the things I did to those boys and girls. I can't recall how many I killed. The death penalty is fair. I accept it. - Enough! - Listen. Would I just strangle a woman over 20? I wouldn't do anything as mundane as that. I took my sweet time getting them to trust me. Once in my home, they savored their pain slowly. I tortured them in ways they'd never imagined I'd do to them. As I keep saying, it wasn't me who did the ninth case. No one believes me. I guess it's to be expected. Stand up. But you're different. The true culprit is loose in town. Only we know the truth. Now! You can refuse or stop when you like. It's your choice. If you're interested, visit my lawyer. He'll give you the details. So long. Excuse me. A visitation? The prison. You were there, no? Yes. Did you see someone? I just wanted to go. No reason. I'm unsure about visiting. I can be indecisive. You met no one? It's that, I can't decide. My decisions are all wrong. Can you decide for me? It must sound odd. No. It's almost red again. I'm still undecided. Samura Law Firm. Here is a summary of the trials, the list of evidence, and the prosecutor's statement. The appeal is soon, so this must stay here. You need to register as a part-timer at our firm. Please fill this out. If any information is leaked out, legal action will be taken. You got it? Yes, I do. Let me know if you have any questions. Mr. Yamato Haimura Criminal Murder Case (A) 24 Serial Murder Cases in Tochigi. Smiling into the camera is Yamato Haimura, the accused. He was adored as a baker. Unbeknownst to all, he murdered 24 people over seven years. Most victims were students of a local high school. Some had never visited his bakery. March 8th, 2010. Supermarket worker. Case ♪1 Sanae Kuboi, 17 years old. Thank you. Yamato Haimura went to her supermarket two or three times a week. They exchanged greetings. Here you are. A Swiss roll. Thanks. As if there by chance, he went to the cafe she frequented before work. He talked to her. Well, hello. Going to work? - Yes. - Good luck. Thanks. - Hello. - Hi. They spoke at her job again. You buy lots of soap. His cafe trips were timed with her work. He took time to build up a relationship. Riku Miyashita, 18 years old. In a bicycle parking lot, he mistakenly tried to ride off on his target's bicycle. Excuse me! This is mine. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Here's mine. Why did I do that? Ticket, please. The bicycles... - Sorry about that. - No problem. Do you like movies? - Uh, yes. - Me too. Oh my god! After that, they would exchange greetings at the theater. With no regard to gender, all victims were late teens with black hair. Diligent students who obeyed school regulations. They were smart. Kaoru Nezu, 26 years old. Yamato denies having killed her. So, they're really dating? They like each other. That's gross. I can't even imagine them together. Kaoru was 26 years old at the time. Her appearance matched his other victims, but her age group was different. She worked for "Sanken Medical," a medical and nursing supply company. She went missing after leaving work. 26 days later, she was found in the woods approximately 15 km from Yamato's house. Say... You're not in our group. We reserved 2 o'clock. I'm sorry. Ma say a, you play squash? I suppose so. After practice we're going for drinks and having a job-hunting network party. Wanna join us? You know the pub "Inagaki"? Meet us there at 7. I'm so sorry, Ma say a. You've waited all this time, right? Our meeting went late. Forgive me. Did you order yet? Not yet. I think... you've changed. Me? Maybe... Was I dorky? Well, perhaps a bit. You were the only one who talked to me in jr. high. Let's eat something. Who's the dude? He's from my hometown. As if being in this shitty college will get us a good job. Looks like we've got a comedian. Networking is an excuse. We're just here to drink. We never exchange information. Our college is garbage! You're thinking about work? Serious guy. What's with him? Can't believe it. What is it? You're leaving? Thanks for the seats, bro! Cut it out. Let's order! Ma say a! Ow! Excuse me. Ma say a! You fucking asshole! Wanna piece of me? Calm down! You need to respect me! I work for a living! Come on, let's go elsewhere. Let's go. - I know your face! - Forget him. I'll bust his head open! You okay? Samura Law Firm Ma say a Kakei. All the bodies of the students recovered from. Yamato's property had no fingernails. Oh, my precious forests. Such a tragedy. Right, doggy? This way. Let's go. I cannot believe this happened in my forest. The body was found around there. It must have been a real fuss. It was more than that. TV people and onlookers were everywhere. Was there anyone who came often? Not sure... But there was someone who came recently. That person. What did they look like? Might have been her friend. Long hair and wore plain clothes. A woman? Yes. She put her hands together like this and seemed to cry. You're back, and in a suit. So? Nothing. Your dad went to the wake at school. I know. I'm not going. I don't care, but he does. I go to a worthless college. He's ashamed of me. Yamato can be categorized as a typical modus operandi criminal. Intelligent and likable, he integrates easily into society. He planned his crimes well. The murder of Kaoru Nezu wasn't premeditated nor was the crime concealed. Seems the killer let his emotions guide the crime. Your way is not the same way. In your case, you removed each of your victims' fingernails. Correct? With regard to the indictments. Correct. Kaoru Nezu's nails were completely intact. You also put between 90 to 100 days between one crime and the next. But she was murdered a month and a half after your last crime. You see what I've been saying. I need to investigate further. The police and judge concluded that two such savage criminals could not exist at the same time in the same area. Me, I think it's possible. I met someone who worked with her. Here's my card. Really? I've spoken to the police many times. Please. Before her murder, she said she felt someone was following her. Someone was stalking her. Who was it? Her friend said that her boss liked Kaoru. I plan to talk to him. Any other leads? I also got in touch with another of her classmates. She told me something. In high school, she'd become a clean-freak with an odd diet. It got worse with time. By her death, she was a full-on germaphobe. The killer likely knew this, and that's why he tortured her in the mud. You're simply amazing. No, I've just started. You're doing it your own way, and getting results. I don't know the right way. It might sound odd for me to say this, but be careful. There's a killer out there. Well, look who's talking. Talking with Yamato reminds me of a time I went to his bakery. You're off to cram school, right? You study hard. Good luck. Orange juice. On the house. Thank you. It's B. L. T. OJ. Beacon, lettuce, tomato, orange juice. Say it. Beacon, lettuce, tomato, orange juice. B. L. T. OJ. Please refrain from using recording devices in the visiting room. Where are you going? I'm from a law firm... You here about the owner? Do you know him? Well, I did. Even if you'd lived near him, you'd never guess he was a killer. Probably so. Want to go in? Thanks. My son and the people in the village who didn't know him criticized me for not seeing what he was. They called me a fool. But let me tell you, were he to escape and ask me to put him up, I probably would. Naturally, I'd hide my grandkids from him. There's something about him. I can understand. Can you? Yes. He was a friendly chap. I simply don't know how he could do such cruel things. The smoke hut was in the backyard. It was here the accused confined and tortured his victims. Devices such as vices and pliers were found within the hut. His crimes came to light when a victim escaped. A search is on for bodies believed to have been dumped in a nearby river. The testimony at the trial should prove interesting. Sanken Medical. Excuse me. You're Mr. Hashimoto of Sanken Medical? Yes. I'm Ma say a Kakei from the law firm representing Yamato Haimura. I'd like to ask about Ms. Kaoru Nezu. Like if I stalked her or not? I've been asked over and over. Wait, please. I was at work when the crime occurred. I've an alibi. I already confirmed that. I'd like to ask if anyone was close to her. I think she had no boyfriend. Not dating, maybe asking her out. I wouldn't know. What're you doing? Sorting through your grandma's stuff. Now? Kinda soon. Won't you decide how I should do this? I can't decide by myself. Throw it all away. I'm serious. We're in mourning. Act like it. Remember those? I was looking through them. Thank you, Mom. Ma say a, lend a hand. It's stuck. Kirie Haimura. Adopted Yamato Haimura (19). Helped him open Bakery Rochelle. Abused by her father physically and sexually. Shielded youths with similar backgrounds to raise in her shelter. "Kirie Haimura." Kirie was a human rights activist. She ran a volunteer group. They visited orphanages and pediatric wards. You were in the group, Mr. Takiuchi? I volunteered with Yamato. How was he at that time? Not only Yamato, but other abused youths lived in her shelter. We volunteered together. He was called "the big win" among them. What do you mean? You may think such children would be quiet and pitiful. Actually, many have behavioral problems. They're selfish and exaggerate their ill-treatment. The result of a lack of love. Yamato controlled those kids well. Another one, please. What do you mean by control? First, he tamed the most rebellious one among them. Whenever the kid started bragging, he'd say, "You're simply amazing." He'd treat him like the leader then dote on the others to make him jealous. This way of his, it came naturally. Here you go. Mr. Kakei, let's go elsewhere. Did Yamato Haimura commit crimes when he was volunteering? Did he... I don't think he killed anyone. Kirie stuck up for him. "Don't look down on him because he's been in juvie." She was really upset. Yamato was her favorite. Everyone came to love him. How about you? I stuck up for him too. He had a real charm back then. He always praised the effort I put in on the volunteer puppet shows. Eat your meat. Thank you for today. Can I ask one more question? Look at this photo. Whoa, get a load of this! Can you point out Yamato? Here. And you? Here. Me when I had long hair. Do you remember this lady? I do. Her name was... Eri, maybe. No, Eriko. Her name's character means "lapel." She wasn't good with people, but she was close to Yamato. She was adopted by Kirie too. She was? She lived with the youths and Yamato at Kirie's home. But she was kicked out. Got herself pregnant. Kirie was strict about such things. Who was the father? Well, I really don't know. Could it be... Yamato was the father? Hmm... I'm not sure. I gave my daughter the book you recommended. She really liked it. That's nice. Any other recommendations? She's in jr. high school, right? She'll adore "Anne of Green Gables." Right, that book. She'll want you to take her to Prince Edward Island. What's wrong? May I ask about the mother? Sure, but which mother? My birth mother was Miyoko Arai. My foster mother was Kirie Haimura. No. My mother. Her name is... Eriko. Did she say something? No, nothing. I see. Let me ask you. Has Eriko, has your mother, been happy? Does your father treat her well? He treats her like a housekeeper. I see. It's more like I was raised by my grandmother. I loved my mother, but I couldn't show it in front of my grandmother. Your father hit you often. He wanted to protect grandmother's reputation. He was strict. I didn't have any free time at all. You often visited my bakery. That time between school and cram school was the only free time I had. I barely passed my high school entrance exam. My grades were terrible. I go to a low-ranked college. You've something that can't be measured. You may not like to hear this, but I loved when you stopped by. It was the only time I felt human. Tell me... Are you my father? So you are. If only. I could hold your hand. Sorry I'm in here. Were you hit again? Your father? How tough you are. If I don't obey him, he takes it out on Mom. It's sweet. But you'll break if you keep it up. Your hand too. If you want to run away, I'm here. Mr. Suzuki's class is way too tough. Sure is. I was lost from the start. Mitsuha, what are you doing? - You see that? - He looked back. He's cool-looking. Yeah, he is. Kakei family. Thank you. I met Yamato Haimura. In jail. The baker? You two were friends. Back at Kirie's shelter. Let's talk about this later. Thanks for your support. See you. Thank you. May I drink too? Were you abused too? I don't know if abused is the right word. That lady, Kirie Haimura, adopted only children who'd been abused, no? Right. My mom hated me. When adopted, you had plaster lodged in your intestines. Yamato wrote this in his letter. Oh... it's his handwriting. You ate plaster as a form of self-injury? I was told it was because of my mother. I couldn't understand what that meant. Anyway, I think I was a bit crazy. That's why Kirie adopted you. Things didn't go well after I was taken in. You only got along with Yamato? You two were close. I know everything. He was the only one there for me. I couldn't terminate it. He said, "Eriko, why, that should be up to you." Does Father know? Of course not. So, this is what prevents you from defying Father? No, it's thanks. Thanks for marrying me. There's no need to be like that anymore. Just now... you were so like him. Him? You mean, Yamato? Who is my real father? Father. Want a drink, dear? Sure, why not? Ma say a. About before... you're your father's son. Have you ever thought to kill him? What? Yamato was found guilty of murdering Kaoru Nezu because someone placed him close to the crime scene. Section 157? Based on Section 157 of the criminal procedure law, identity protection will be enforced, okay? Please proceed. When a witness could face mental intimidation based on their relationship to the defendant, identity protection measures can be applied. Based on the witness's testimony, Yamato was also found guilty of the murder of Kaoru Nezu. Please read the pledge aloud. Why was Section 157 of the criminal procedure law applied to the witness? Normally, it's applied to victims, no? When he was ten, witness Itsuki Kanayama was connected to Yamato. Gonna throw it! Ready? Sorry! Thank you. It's my turn! Kids want to get along with those a bit older. He used that to win them over. Itsuki and his younger brother used to play with Yamato. That's all? Yamato would pit them against each other. They'd cut each other with cutters and gravers. He had them do this over and over. They weren't seriously injured, but they still have scars. Weren't the police informed? The boys did the slashing. But Section 157 was applied. It means he was regarded as a victim, no? His testimony can't be reliable. He may hold a grudge. If you read the judicial record, you'll find I was of the same opinion. Still, the witness was admitted. - Why is that? - I don't know. The police wouldn't admit their mistakes. The prosecutors wanted a guilty verdict. That's why they used testimony they knew was unreliable. - Mr. Kakei. - Listen. They let the true culprit go. Remember, Yamato is a serial killer. Take what he says with a grain of salt. I'm looking into this rationally. Well, then. Do you know what he did when he was 14? The girl in the fifth grade... He took her from a bus station to a back street. He knocked her out with a block to the head. Her underwear off, he filled her privates with stones. With both feet, he jumped up and down on her face. Organs were injured and her face collapsed in. Most of her front teeth were broken. Her right eye ruptured. You're his defense attorney, right? Why not trust your client? Yes, I am. You are not. But you feel Itsuki was compromised? Read Yamato's M.O. again and keep your cool! You're the one making prejudgments. You made business cards on your own. Don't do that. A non-licensed attorney working a case is problematic. You're with us on paper. It's my neck that's on the line. I'm sorry. If you want to play detective, go elsewhere. Cyber Data Co. Are you Mr. Kakei? Mr. So um a? Thank you for your time. Let's talk outside. Me and Itsuki entered the company as engineers. Fortunately, I was reassigned to sales. Our company treats engineers like dirt. That's why Itsuki quit? No, it's 'cause he hit his boss. Was Itsuki the type to hit someone easily? No, not at all. They weren't a good match. The boss was a he-man type. He heckled Itsuki a lot. He covered his face with hair because of a bruise. A bruise? Around here. It was big. The long hair was for that, not for fashion. His boss teased him and said he looked like a girl. So he blew up. Guy was stressed. Seems his father said similar things. He told me the teasing reminded him of his dad. Did he visit any clients? Engineers do field maintenance. Sales doesn't do that. Your company deals with Sanken Medical, no? Did Itsuki visit them? Where the victim worked? Yes, he went there. Several times, in fact. Do you think he got close to her? I don't think so. That's not like him. Really? To Mr. Yamato Haimura, What I know from his work friend is. Itsuki Kanayama was acquainted with Kaoru Nezu. It's possible he's the killer. His father was oppressive, making him feel inferior, which resulted in his docile character. His work was exhausting and he had no friends. He was depressed and lonely. The possibility for him to lose it was great. Ma say a. Yeah? You're in my way. Got a problem? What's up, fucker? Are these your friends? Hey! Ma say a! You seem different. Watch it, asshole. Sorry. Ma say a? Is something wrong? You're bleeding! You okay? I'm sorry. Hold on. Stop. What is it? Ma say a! What is it? Come to bed. I'll take a shower. So um a. Found the photo with Itsuki. He's the guy behind me. Hello. From the other day. You said a woman cried where Kaoru Nezu was murdered. Is this him? Yes, the hair was like that. It's a man? Yes, he is. This bruise. I think I saw it. Thank you. This is where she was murdered. I killed her. Hold on. Please! Let me go! No, I didn't. I didn't. I mean... What happened? If not arrested, do you think you'd continue killing? Yes, because it's essential who I am. I've identified who killed Kaoru Nezu. You're simply amazing! I met Itsuki Kanayama. When he was 10, his brother 8, and you 20, you often played with them. Yes, Itsuki and Daichi. You recall what you did to them? I wanted them to have something their parents could never give them. Torturing them? Acceptance. I accepted what they liked, tried to do, and what they valued. Repressed children tend to have low self-esteem. I wished to care for them. Itsuki was not the boy his father wanted him to be. He knew it and tried, but it wasn't possible. You targeted children such as that. You haven't changed a bit. The Kanayama brothers are supposed to have cut each other. But this isn't true. In a way, it's true. It was you who led them to that decision. Who wants to play the pain game? Go ahead. Itsuki pointed at his brother. Sometimes Daichi pointed at him first. The one pointed at was cut with a blade. Over and over. So, you believe what Itsuki told you. He's regretted pointing at his brother for a long time. This is why he took you up on your offer? What have you found out? Kaoru Nezu was a germaphobe with a daily routine set in stone. You knew this. You led Itsuki there. He said your eyes were the same as when they did their cutting. When touched by those eyes, there was no defying you. Remember when we played the pain game? Seeing your face now, I'd like to play again. It's weird. I came to apologize. No... please. Who should I play with? I want you to decide. I'll do as you say. Got it. See ya. Itsuki didn't decide alone. You forced him into it. Not only to kill her, but to let him bear the guilt. You intentionally asked to meet. She didn't fit my preferred age group. How do you explain that? When you targeted her, she was still a teenager. Like Itsuki, she was a former target. Was she not? Why do you think so? Just like you obsessed over the Kanayama brothers, you obsessed over Kaoru Nezu. Obsessed over Itsuki and Daichi? Me? Itsuki showed me these. They're letters from you. Is this not obsession? There's more than just these. "Itsuki, how are you?" "The trial is done and I'm preparing to appeal." "There are points I don't agree with, so I'm hoping to see them reviewed." "But it's fine." I'll accept your testimony in court. I won't tell the appeal board what you did nor will I blame you. I understand your feelings. You're in pain. Can you please come and see me? I want us to talk. Yamato Haimura. Is this a threat? That should he not visit, you'd testify he pointed at Ms. Nezu. Would testimony like that trouble him? He feels guilty about it. If he felt guilty, he'd confess. That's why he told me. You're wrong. At the trial, he said he saw me. To you, he said I asked to meet and made him choose. If one's true, the other's false. He said he couldn't say that in court. Did you think both were false? He wanted to put the guilt on me. That's the extent of it. You found Itsuki by yourself. You're simply amazing. Even the police didn't get as far as you did. Still, you were fooled at the last moment. I'm disappointed. He knew Ms. Nezu and asked her out many times, but she refused. His feelings grew until... That sounds rather tough. Sorry to trouble you. - Let's talk tomorrow. - Thanks. See you. No! Stop! He followed her and forced her into his car. In the woods, he killed her. He didn't want to get caught, so, he contacted you and bent the truth. Can't you see? Visiting hours are over, right? Let's talk a bit more, Ma say a. It's fine, Mr. Watanabe? Itsuki's father had wanted a manly son. His father wouldn't accept his son's long hair to hide his bruise. He yelled and hit him every day. He wanted escape from the pain. Many kids like this show behavioral problems. Some inflate their troubles, others tell excessive lies. Yes. I felt it was weird when he testified that he'd seen me. I had to be sure. That's why I wanted to see him. Hearing this from you now, I'm sure of his guilt. You caught him on your own. You're simply amazing. No. You've suffered so long. You've suffered, so you understand the plight of others. You were special even then. You're so very kind. "Repressed children tend" "to have low self-esteem." Did you think this of me as well? "I wanted to help fix" "their low self-esteem." Me too. You had me in your sights. You were just in jr. high school. I'd be in high school soon enough. "I took my sweet time getting them to trust me." "They savored their pain slowly." Those were your words. Reel them in and then torture them. Why did you do it? It's the only way I know how to deal with people. It's all I know. I'm a victim too, you know. An unwanted child will come to resent life. Did you kill her? Her excessive germaphobia and demanding eating habits were behavioral patterns likely caused by severe trauma. Trauma inflicted by you, no? You hurt her but didn't kill her. That was your regret, no? The police were onto you. You wanted not only to kill her but also to fill Itsuki with guilt so that his suffering would last for years to come. I'm sure that for you using me to investigate the case gave you both the joy of controlling me and the joy of reliving the crime. Am I correct? You don't think of me as your father any longer. Did your mother tell you? How did you dispose of her child? Did she tell you who the father was? He volunteered on weekends. He had a wife and kids. Irregular periods caused her not to notice. She gave birth on a mattress in an abandoned house. It was stillborn. We burned it to cinders then threw it in the river. Are you relieved or disappointed? Maybe you feel you're now a boring person. Subconsciously, normal people like you want to be special. Your belief of being the son of a killer gave you confidence, no? I nearly killed a man. But I couldn't. At that moment, I realized I wasn't your son. That's great. Once on this side, that's it. If only you could be my son. I wanted to believe it. I'm tired. Is this enough? Why throw the nails away? Many other clues lay about. The bodies, for example. The hut was full of incriminating evidence. I'm unsure why. I suppose it was a kind of farewell ritual. See you. One last question. Did your mother have beautiful fingernails? When I was a boy, yes. Crap. Their food is really good. I'm glad my first time there was with you. If you don't mind, I'd like another drink. Don't be in such a rush! You okay? Such beautiful nails. Do you want to remove them? Akari Kano. I can understand. The desire to have a piece of someone you love. Yamato said you'd understand this. You do, don't you? Sadawo Abe. Kenshi Okada. Takanori Iwata. Miho Nakayama. Based on the novel “The Sickness Unto Death Penalty” by Riu Kushiki. Screenplay by Ryo Takada. Music by Takashi Oh mama.
