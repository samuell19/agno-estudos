Why did you stop? Keep digging. Dig on... And then you will meet me. Now answer my questions. Who are you? What are you doing here? Why have you come? I just happened to pass by. Is that so? I don't think you're telling the truth. You intend to capture and sell snakes for money. You are a liar that can't be trusted. You don't deserve to live. Now relax... You are now under my power. There is nothing you can do about it. You will join me in a campaign of vengeance. WHISPERS OF THE DEAD Eka... Suparmon... Eka... Pretty Eka... Why not be my girl? My father won't approve. He says I should date an engineer. Someone with a good job and big money to spend on me. That's no problem. It's easy. I should leave and see you later. Suparmon.... I look forward to it. Your experience. I miss it already. You have the sweetest lips. But you... You are sweet everywhere. From the ends of your hair... to the tips of your toes. Everywhere. Don't you believe me? Eka...my princess. You have betrayed me again. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help... Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Careful! Search everywhere. Help! Eka...come. - Okay. The pain... The pain... The pain... Make it stop! Jaka! Jaka! Make it stop! Peace to you. Praise to Allah. Come in. Bring your blessings. Jaka! Jaka! Jaka! Unfortunately... It's too late. Jaka... - This is the work of someone evil. It is my duty to protect Eka. To keep her body pure. This I have promised. Without compromise, Jaka. Iwan... You're up early, Iwan. You looked very tired and sick last night. Feeling better? They say... Suparmon suffocated to death. Can you believe that? Father said that last night too. Eka said the devil seemed to recognize her. And wanted to kill her. Maybe she was mistaken. Who would hold such a grudge? My father said there's a snake-demon who roams the village. Yes... He says when the snake appears death and destruction will follow. l don't believe such things. There is no snake-demon. But you saw what happened to Suparmon Nagita's body. Yes... Horrible. Even worse than was how Jaka's died. Jaka? How? From what l heard... His body continued to swell after he was dead. I'm going to help carry Nagita's body to the tomb. I'm coming too. After all, Eka Putri is my friend. Maybe I can cheer her up. - Alright. Jaka... Jaka... Jaka... Panapa... Are you sick? Yes. It will pass. The funeral upset me. May l be excused? To go where? The chief's house. We want to investigate who killed Nagitan Suparmon and Jaka. Don't. You are not healthy enough. l am fine, sir. Excuse me. Good evening, auntie. - Eka? Why are you visiting so late at night? There's no way I can stay at home. Nagita Suparmon's death was so terrible. Could l sleep here? - Yes. Badannya is not feeling well. You can sleep in that room. Tomorrow morning we can talk. - Thank you. Honey... Eko is here. Honey... You don't have to move. Who's there? Who are you? Did you come to kill me? What are you waiting for? Who are you really? Look closely at my face and you will surely know. I don't know. You used to beat me often. Then you threw me into that old, unused well. Parta? It's good you still remember. Now make your move. Eka, come to me. Eka... Come here. Help! Help! What do you want? l want you to be mine. Don't hurt me... Please! Help!! Help! Help! Help! Iwan? We'll be there soon. Yes. You can avenge that snake demon. Don't mention that again. Why? Because I don't believe in it. There is a logical explanation. You're not up to the task. l don't want to see father's dead body. Burnt and broken. Certainly. You father does not want to be killed by an intruder. What's this nonsense? That intruder is someone with advanced fighting skills. It may be the same person who killed Sudarmon. There appears to be a connection between him and Eka. Everything is okay. Joko... Go home. Uncle will come later. Alright, uncle. Eka... Do you have any memory... of ever offending or betraying a man? l have no such memory. Have you ever... ...been taken care of by a man? Which one is it, sir? In the matter of men... Women have many advantages. l practice abstinence. But sometimes with a handsome man... l can be seduced. Because of his money? Or because he's handsome? Both. Eka... But... Are you thinking of a particular man? In my inner observation... That man died a long time ago. A miserable death. And carried his grudge to the grave. I have no vision of who he is. Parta... Actually, I've never liked Parta. He looked bad. And he was poor. But he never tired of chasing and flirting with me. Sometimes he'd make sexual comments. If you're heading home, can I go with you? Eka... Your spit is as sweet as your face. Eka! Your ass is also nice! I became involved with the Village Chief's son. So that Parta would no longer want me. But l knew Parta would be watching. Making him envious and jealous... making him want me even more. Later I heard from his own broken mouth. His prayers begging for my heart. Open your eyes. Take it. Eat. What do you want, Parta? If it pleases the Queen Goddess... l want to be rich. And liked by all women. You will have your wish... As long as you obey the conditions. l promise. You may embrace me. Continue, Parta. Continue... Now you are suffering. But soon you will enjoy any woman you choose. But remember... You can't get married. I will never be put aside. l do not like to be excluded. l became Parta's pet whore. To protect myself from being poor... l wanted to become Parta's wife. So... Quietly... l then... I made love to Bana. To... To make him jealous. I love you. All my wealth... will be left to you. As long as you stop playing with Bana. Then write the will, Parta. Tomorrow. You'll have it all. Help! - Come here! lf anyone eIse ever Iearns about my secret... You will die! What is it! - Something terrible has happened inside! Horrible! Hold him. - Don't let him get away. Do not forget! No one! Lift him up! I'm scared... Very scared. I will try to help. But you must help too. You need to cleanse yourself. Stop doing dirty things. Yes. l will obey you. Don't! I'm not angry anymore. Iwan! Iwan... The nightmare of death again? Nightmare? - Yes. Since returning from my father's house, you often have these dreams. What actually happened to you? Tell me! l am your wife! No. No. l am fine now. Bu... I'm just tired from all the work at the office. But when you came back, you looked so scared. I think you can't forget about your confrontation with the demon. Don't say that again. Why? Are you scared? I am scared. Anyone would be scared against a demon-snake! Just by talking about it. You mean...that intruder was really a demon-snake? It is real? Not possible. The doctor who examined Nagita also said so. I don't believe it. Let's sleep. Iwan! It happened so fast... Iwan wasn't this sick last night. It's not that l don't want to. But we've been there many times already. l need the priest! - We'll get him. Stay calm- Iwan... Hold on to life! I'll try calling first. Then we may have to go. Peace be with you. - In the shadow of Allah. How is Iwan doing? He hasn't gotten better. Sir...we must be open to the idea that he is becoming a snake-demon. Why do you think this? From his words. He always talks about snakes. Obsessed with them. And he was found near the snake pit. What about Parta? Yes. He is also suspicious. We should try to find Parta He also acts strange. In that case... we must be vigilant. Yes, sir Oh, excuse me... I want to get out, alright? l want you here, baby. You are really impatient. No one can have her. I won't... I won't... Eka...Please come back. Eka... Come back to me. l won't hurt you. Come back, dear. Eka! Eka... My dearest... Forget me... Do you think l could forget you? Go... You mean nothing to me. l am with you. Forever... l miss you... l want to fondle you... Look into my eyes. Look into my eyes. Now l must remove your tongue. The tongue that promised to never leave me. Hello? Iwan... This is Mira. What's wrong? My sister Susanti called to say father is very ill. Can you leave the office? How could l when there's so much work? There's more news. What? Eka is dead. Are you there? This is all so terrible. I'm going there now. - Where? The place, where she was killed. What for? To look for clues. Clues? - Yes. What evidence? Mira? You shouldn't be here It's dangerous. There was a murder... police found her body. Who was the killer? It's not known. But...Near the victim... A large snake skin was found. Maybe the snake creature? - It could be. A snake that is shedding skin... is very fierce when disturbed. Do you know who the security officer is? l am the security officer. Now it is time for you to leave. Excuse me. This could have easily been faked when Eka was killed. Are those fish scales? My top Agricultural Engineer doesn't recognize this? It's snake skin. - Snake skin? Why did you save it? It must be part of this. Yes. It might be useful. For your father. Yes. And it may help us solve the mystery. Why are all the victims from my village? You shouldn't take that so seriously. Let's get some sleep. I'm tired. What?! What? What? Mira... Now take my side. I'll kill you if you disobey my orders. If you wake up later... ...with the intention of investigating me If that idea enters your head. Get rid of the skin immediately. Now put it on the floor. Then burn it. Iwan! Iwan wake up! Iwan! Mira...What's wrong? Mira, Mira...calm down. I'm scared! - Why? There! - Where? Leave... Go away! It was a nightmare. No It's burnt there! What is that? Snake skin. The snake made me burn it. Where are snakes that can talk? This kind of thing happens if you get wrapped up in something. l was making out with you. Then suddenly you turned into that snake-demon. You ordered me to burn the skin. It was scary. It was so real. l could smell it burning... The stench... Mira? Mira? I'm asking you to forget about it... this murder. No. l want to continue to investigate. My dearest... I'm sorry for leaving today... I've gone to visit my father. Hugs and kisses, honey...Mira Speak up... Speak up, Subaja The evil demon! Yes, l am ready... l will accept the curse... What do you mean? - Wait. What your father just said was groundbreaking. His acceptance... Don't disturb him... When he's finally at peace. Now... l am very sorry. Father. You must love and take care of mother... Mira...I am sorry Father! Everything is done. Will he get better? We'll see later. Priest... How much do we owe you? Later... l must treat you as well. Why not treat me now? Tonight is better. Here? - No. At my place. If you say so. - I do. You want to know who that snake-demon is? Or not? Priest? - Eh? l will be there tonight. Bana... Who are you? Parta... You used to sneak into my bedroom and fuck Eka. Now l will fuck your wife. Over my dead body, demon! Follow my voice... ...to learn of Satan. Learn of Satan? Just follow my voice. If you want the proof you needed. What of Satan? Then leave... l have surrendered to Satan. l believe. l too... ...will know Satan. - After that... You will forget everything. After that... You must also forget me. Now...Remove your clothes. Priest! l will bathe you. Hurry up! What Satan hates the most... is for the body to be covered. You are a rich whore. Infected by the snake-demon. Who are you? Who is standing here? Iwan! You have interfered in my affairs, Mira. l am your wife. I love you. l don't want you to suffer. You know nothing about suffering. There will be many more victims. Are you truly the snake-demon? Lay down. And the spirits of the dead will whisper to you... You damned priest! Mira! l am so embarrassed. I'm ashamed Forgive me... We were very lucky. You could have been raped. We must be thankful... Susanti told me where to find you. Earlier I saw Parta kill Bana and then go inside to rape the woman. Then he left, but l followed him. He went inside the big house up ahead. We'll get to the bottom of this. It's the end for the snake-demon! Someone came out. My father is still sick. He's only pretending. Faking a sickness. Come on! Let's attack! Stop. That's enough. Too aggressive. He's not there! Look for him. Check everywhere What's wrong? What's this? Your father must be arrested. Tell us. Is this the Devil's home? Don't say that. My father is sick. He is not here. - No. He's not in the house. It can't be. l saw him come here. We must arrest him before he takes another victim. Right? So the priest was the killer. That old fart. I'm not surprised. It is true that he tried to rape her over there. Let's break this up. - It's time to head home. That is true. Look! Run! Stop! Don't come closer! You men have tortured me. Now it's my turn. Sir! Parta is here. Just outside. He's fighting... - Parta? Come on, men. We'll get him this time. Everybody be careful. - Come on! l will fight. Everyone prepare to die. No one will survive. l will finish them all. l already know that much. It's too late to stop killing now. So... l will eliminate them all. Or l could... Could... Rape the girls. Attack him! Wait. Wait. Not yet. For the sake of peace in our village Everyone! We will fight him! Just wait a moment. We must eradicate the Devil's control. But why? They have become one! The spell can't be separated. Who are you? Allah's servant. Stay out of my affairs. Get out! The demon's spell has enslaved the human body. To satisfy his lust. Who are you? Who are you really? Answer me. Parta is my name. The person whose body I borrowed. Because he disturbed my grave. Now he is my slave. Together we wanted our revenge. Against those who insult us. By killing them. I would rather hear from the innocent body you're using. Innocent? We are both guilty. Of course. Then return the shell. No... No! (praying) They have separated. Iwan! Iwan... Father? Where have you been? I was in the snake pit. But I'm free now. l will no longer interfere with Gods work... Now... Everything is clear. Iwan... Mira... Where am I? Why are you crying? I think... I thought you were dead. Mira... Iwan... Mira. Village chief... Say goodbye first, please. You once found snakeskin between my fingers. While rinsing the mud covering my body. Remember. Not only that... The night Eka died, you got out of bed for awhile. In the morning, I was surprised to find the door to the house unlocked. And when you said to burn the snake-skin. I was mostly afraid of you growing bigger. Mira... Over there is the place where we met. After you moved here from your parent's. Mira!
