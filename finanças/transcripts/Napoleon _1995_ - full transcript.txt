Child's voice: Beneath this towering maple Lives an animal With the savage soul of a jungle beast! I am a fearless warrior. But unfortunately... I look like this. [dog howling] There it goes. [dogs howling] The howl of the wild dogs. I'm coming, guys. I'm joining the pack. I'm gonna get to the jungle. Just have to get over this. Oops. Forgot it was this high. [dogs howling] They're calling me. They need me to help hunt. They've heard about my incredible strength. Ooh-whoa! Out there, I'd roam wild, I'd kill for my food, I'd-- [children's voices] Uh-oh. What's that? Child: Look at the dog with the chiffon. Balloons. That means there's gonna be trouble. Time for my keen survival instincts to take over. Whoops! Uh-oh. Woman's voice: Muffin. Was that you, Muffin? Mom, please, I told you. My name is Napoleon. I'm a conqueror! Hope she doesn't see that flowerpot. Oh, no. Here they come. Boy: Come on, boy, where are you, Muffin? Muffin, where's my Muffin? Come on, Muffin! Whoa! Muffin, dear-- I'm fine. Hey. Candy. Yeow! Look at them. I can run 10 times faster than that, and they know it. [children yelling] Listen to them. If I attacked, Then they'd really have something to scream about. Hey, I got an idea. Let's throw some dork in the water. Well, I said dork, not dog! Girl: Cute little Muffin. I hate the water. You're a cutie. A cute little Muffin-Muffin. You're a cute little Muffin puppy. You're so cute, Muffin. Woman: Hey, kids, time for birthday cake. Yay! Yay! Napoleon: Hey, wait for me! Hey. Hey. What about me? I--I can't swim. Oh, please don't let me fall in. Muffin, Did you get your little paws wet? Little paws? What can I expect? I'm cursed with cute looks. I'll show them. How about a little slobber on this propeller cap? Next time it spins-- a spit Storm. Where are you going, dear, hmm? Just trying to have some fun, ma. Hey, look at that. That's something new For Napoleon to investigate. The crowd cheers as Napoleon enters the basket. Listen to how they yell. Muffin, get out of there immediately. Immediately! There's no Muffin in here, only Napoleon. Come on, mom, I'm just playing. Jump out now! I said, jump out now! Look at me! I'm flying! I'm high in the Sky! I'm--uh-oh. Muffin, jump down from there right now. Ohh. Now he's up too high. Mom! Mommy! Should I jump? No, don't jump! Don't jump! The trees will catch you! Just stay in the basket And don't try anything foolish! Just sit still! You'll be all right! Very cool. Napoleon: (music) there's a new world out there (music) (music) coming to find me (music) (music) everything's waiting up ahead (music) (music) nothing's behind me (music) (music) if I don't dream (music) (music) if I don't try (music) (music) how will I know (music) (music) how far (music) (music) I'll fly? (music) (music) there may be mountain peaks (music) (music) I'm gonna slide down (music) (music) there may be rivers fast and wide (music) (music) I'm gonna ride down (music) (music) unless I dream (music) (music) unless I try (music) (music) how will I know (music) (music) how far (music) (music) I'll fly? (music) (music) I'm high-flying and free (music) (music) there's the sun rising for me (music) (music) there may be cities beyond the rooftops (music) (music) oceans beyond the sea (music) (music) I'll fly (music) (music) up to another Sky (music) (music) no one has traveled so far (music) (music) out to a faraway star (music) (music) maybe farther (music) Napoleon: Wow! Let's go back and do that again. No, no. Back, back. Towards the train. Stupid wind. You're blowing the wrong way. This is not good. This is definitely not good. I'm heading out towards the... Water! Oh, the only thing I hate worse than being in the water Is being this high above it! Hey, help! There's a puppy up here. Doesn't anybody find that a little weird? Come on, balloons, go down, go down, go down! Oh, no! Stay up, stay up! Oh, I don't like all this water. I'm getting seasick just looking at it. What's that? Huh? Help! Help! Stop! Hey, slow down! No one's ever gonna find me out here. Paah! When did dogs start migrating? Huh? Hmm? Hey! I'm talking to you. Oh, I didn't see you. My name's muff-- I mean, Napoleon. I'm birdo birdaluce! What are doing--ow! What are you doing up here? Trying to get down. You got to help me. I don't like it up here. Look. We're coming near land. Maybe I can jump. Just get back in the basket, furball. Ok? You don't want to be out. Now sit down. Sit! Sit down. That's a good doggy. Back up! No, no. Back up! Ouch! Don't try and get out, 'cause it's just too far down! Ouch! Oh, my goodness. Napoleon: So how am I gonna get down? I have an idea. Watch. Will you stop fidgeting? Stop fidgeting! Stop pecking! Furry nut! I'm still, I'm still, ok? Here's the idea. It's got to be very precisely timed As soon as we're over that beach down there. What are you gonna do? The basket is traveling southeast at--ow! Hey, what happened? Where'd you go? I'm fine. Now, to bring this thing in For a perfect landing... Just got to... [gulps] Uh-oh. I know exactly what I'm doing. Whoa! Hey, take it easy. This will bring you in for a-- Hey! Nice, soft land-- Whoa! Flap your paws, Napoleon! Flap your paws! What am I saying? Jump out! You'll get killed in that--oh, no! Oh! Oh, dear! What have I done? Oh, my goodness! That was nice and soft? I'd hate to see what you consider a crash-landing. Crash-landing or not, I got you down, didn't I? Ooh, my neck. [neck cracks] that's better. A little bruised, but feeling fine. In fact, feeling incredibly fine and free. Oh, and I suppose I did nothing. Are you listening to me? Napoleon! Oh! Buhh! Where's that fluff ball running off to? Look at that. The world I left behind. So long, city. This is my Chance to be free, To live life without rules, To hunt and play and stay up as late as I want. [sadly] so long, mom. [dog howling] Hey, it's the wild dogs! [dogs howling] Hey, birdo, come with me. We'll find them together. We'll be like 2 explorers. I'll bark if I smell them down here, And you'll chirp if you spot them up there. I don't chirp. I tweet. It's an entirely different sound. Chirping is annoying and grating, But tweeting is melodic and soothing. Tweet-tweet tweet! Hello? Sorry. I'm just so excited... Joining the savage beasts! Yeah, you look awfully savage in that red ribbon! Ha! I'd love to help you, but I belong out in that Forest. That's where my flock headed. I lost them when I stopped to help you. Now, why don't both of us just get along home? No. I won't go home and be a house pet. Never, never, never! There's nothing worse than a puppy in denial. Tuk tuk tuk! Ba-ha! You won't last a minute out here in the wild. You'll be killed before nightfall. Tomorrow, the vultures Will be pecking the flesh from your bones And picking your eyes out! You're just trying to scare me. I don't have to scare you. There'll be plenty of other animals to do that! If you think I'll stick around and watch, You're crazy. I don't believe you, and I'm not going back now. I've made up my mind. Now, where are they? Where would I be if I was a wild dog? [dog howling] It's coming from over that way! [dogs howling] Back home, I'd have to be in bed by now, But out here, all the rules are off. I can stay up all night if I feel like it. [owl hoots] I can go anywhere I want. This is great. Who! Who! Who! Who! It's me, me. Go back to your home, puppy. [fearfully] ha, I don't see a puppy here. Awful things happen to pets out here in the wild. Ha. Yeah, sure. Like what? They learn to kill, and they can't stop. You're just trying to scare me. I've seen it happen. It happened to a cat! [French accent] oh, what an untangled web I weave. Whoo. Come to admire this fabulous piece of art? Actually, I was wondering If you knew a good place to sleep out here. Is my web not beautiful? I use no knitting needles, Just my 8 little feets. I think you missed a spot. Ok, where? Um, there. Right there. Get your nose out of there! You know how long this took me to-- Hey! Watch the tail! Sorry. Yuck! Get this off of me. Ugh! [coarse new York accent] aw, now look what you done. You're lucky you're not a fly. [sniffs] Finally got that web out of my nose. [gasps] I never saw a tree like that. It looks like it's got a tunnel through its trunk, And it looks like the perfect place To spend the night. I even smell some food. I wonder if... Somebody lives here. Hello? Is that a mouse I hear? Where do they keep their snacks? Just as I thought. Huh? Can't have any mice crawling around my house. Hmm. This smells good. [lapping] Hmm. Furry mouse. Big yellow mouse. [rustling] What's that? Is it a wild dog? Hello! Any wild dogs out there?! Hmm. Hmm. Time to rid my house of the mouse. Huh? What? The mouse. Good thing I'm not a mouse. Ha ha. You can't fool me with that pitiful disguise. I'll rip it off you! Waah! [hisses] Whoa! This cat's nuts! Thinks I'm a mouse! Oh, no! Aah! Darn ribbon! I got to pull hard! Uhh! [cat growling] [whimpering, panting] It's ok. I'm safe here. Think she's gone. Slash the mousy. Ow! No! Arrgh! [cat growling] Raar! Whoa, deep water! Arrgh! Oh, no! What's the matter, can't swim? Listen to me. I'm not a mouse. You are a deeply disturbed animal. You should-- Shut up! My job is to destroy all vermin in this house. Mouse must die. Now! [cat growling] Stay back! [owl screeching] I warned you about her. What's the matter, can't swim? Thank you. Go home. That cat won't rest until you're dead. That cat is fish food by now. Ha ha. You're dead, mousy. Napoleon's mother: Rise and shine, Muffin. It's a beautiful morning. Time to get up, Muffin. Wake up. I'm up, mom. Mommy? [yawns] Guess I was dreaming. Really thought I was back home. But I'm not, and that's that. So my first day wasn't so great. That's all behind me. I made it through the first night away from home, And now I don't have to worry about that stupid cat. Oh, no, a River. I hate the water. Why does water scare me so much? [mimicking] why does water scare me so much? Hey, stop making fun of me! Hey, stop making fun of me! I'm just trying to find the wild dogs. Well, you know what? They're on the other side... Ohh. Of the water. [lorikeets laughing] On the other side of the water! Guess I'm gonna have to do it. Guess I'm gonna have to do it. Hee hee hee hee! Ok. I can do this. I'm not gonna let a little water stop me, For I am... [gulps] Napoleon. Think he'll make it? Ha ha ha! No way! Whoa! Cold! Whoa! Look out! Hmm, this dog's nuts. I did it! I did it! Hey, do you know where the wild dogs are? You're headed in the right direction. Just keep going. Thanks. What's with those birds back there? Oh, they just mimic everything. Hey, that gives me an idea. Wait! Wait, wait! That's the wrong way! I want to teach those birds a lesson. Here he comes. Here he comes. I'm ba-ack. I'm ba-ack. I'm ba-ack. I'm a stupid bird. I'm a stupid bir--oh! Oh! Nasty little dog! There. That shut them up. And you know what? I like walking over waterfalls. Where's the next one? A wild dog must be ready to pounce at any suspicious sound. [yawning] Like that one. I'll scare off whatever vicious beast waits ahead! No matter how terrifying. Hmm? I'll give this thing my warning growl. Grr! Oh, I'm so frightened. My stomach growls louder than that. Yeah, well, I didn't want to scare you. Yeah, right. Nice try. You know I've got killer instincts. [grumbling] Oh, I hate climbing down. Why are all the good leaves up top? Time to move on to the next tree. That is if you can restrain your killer instincts. Look, buddy, my bite is a lot worse than my bark. You're just lucky you're not what I like to eat. You should have seen what I did to this cat last night. She must have been 10 feet tall, A hundred pounds, And I took care of her, so you better watch out. Underneath my fur, my flesh is crawling. I'm just trying to find where the wild dogs live. Do I look like a wild dog to you? I don't even [sniff] have a tail. [sniff] ugh. [dogs howling] That's it! That's the sound! I do not associate with any creatures That make that dreadful noise. Look, I could really use your help. I can't seem to spot them, So I thought while you're up in a tree-- Ah, so you finally get around to the truth. You need me. Can't climb trees, can you? I can climb anything. Back home I climbed over a wall Twice as big as that tree. Then you should have no problem climbing up And joining me for dinner. Come on. Here we go. Hup! Ho! All right, I can't do that. I was just trying to be tough. Ahh... Do you see the wild dogs? Let's see... No wild dogs on that leaf. None over here. Hey, what's the big idea? Oh, I forgot to mention. Can't see farther than 3 feet. You are the rudest animal I have ever met. Well, I may be rude, But at least I'm not deluded. I don't need his help. I don't need anyone's help. Bawk! I can do it-- Huh? I can do it all on my own. I am Napoleon. A conqueror learns to fend for himself. Napoleon, is that you down there? Stand back. I'm about to make A graceful, perfect 2-point landing. Well, it's improved anyway. Birdo! Thanks to you, I can't find my flock anywhere! Cheer up. I have a bird joke for you. What does a 500-pound parrot say? "Polly want a cracker now!" "polly want a cracker." Hold on! Ha ha ha! Oh, that is a scream! Wait a minute! That is not funny. That's insulting to birds. It's just a stereotype. Birdo, calm down! Awk! Ouch! It was just a joke, birdo. This is no laughing matter. We've both lost our homes. This is my home! Don't be ridiculous. You won't last a week. You can't even fend for yourself. Then teach me, birdo! Come on! Teach you? What do I look like? Ooh, millet! Ack--gravel! It would take too long for you to learn how to live out here, And I don't have time to teach a new dog old tricks. I'm a quick learner. I bet it will be fun. Fun? Ha! You know nothing of living in the wild! You belong back in your doghouse! No! I won't go back! Out here, I feel free. I feel like a conqueror. At home, they don't even call me Napoleon. They call me-- Awk! Oh, well. Now, what is it they call you that's so terrible? Well, don't tell anyone, ok? It's our secret. Back home, they call me... Muffin. Muffin? Ooh, my, my. Deep voice: Muffin? Ha ha ha! Who's that? Muffin! Hey, stop making fun of me! Muffin... (music) Muffin wants to live outdoors (music) (music) that's our life, it isn't yours (music) (music) go back where your life began (music) (music) go back to your Muffin pan (music) (music) Muffin, before you get beaten (music) (music) Muffin, before you get eaten (music) Don't listen to them, Napoleon!

[lorikeets giggling] I'll never go home now. I never want to hear that name again. Oh, no. I thought this thing was attached to the shore. Ohh... Why do I always end up in the water? Do I look like a fish? All right, well, at least this thing is moving. I'll just sit tight and wait till it reaches the other side. This is going to work out just fine. Great. Where's the wind when you need it? Sure, when I was in the balloon, It was blowing me all over the place, Now when I could use it... How far do you expect to get Without a sail or an oar? Ok, so maybe I forgot a few details. Well, are you just gonna sit there like a pup on a log? Come on. Jump off. Swim back. Uh, I have another secret for you, birdo. I can't swim. Well, of course you can swim. I can't. Ever hear of the dog paddle? Yeah. So? So you're a dog. Get in the water and start paddling. I don't know how. I can't. I'll drown! You can do this, Napoleon. All you need is a little push. Hey! Just pretend like you're running. Hey, I'm swimming! I can swim! Once again, the bird gets no credit. I'm really good at this. Look, birdo, I'm swimming! Not bad, mmm, not bad. Go, pup, go! I did it! Birdo, I'm slipping! I can't get out! Now, it's easy. Your front legs are for pulling, Your back legs are for pushing, So... Push! I made it. 'Course you did. Now, if I'm going to be your teacher, You have to trust me. Lesson number one--food. Worms have very good nutritional value, Slugs are extremely juicy and tender, And these seeds are a wonderful between-meal snack. They're high in fiber, and they won't fill you up. Yuck! [spits] This isn't what wild dogs eat. This isn't what any dogs eat. There's something you might prefer over there. What's to eat over there? Oh, it's what you want. It's what you've been waiting for. The food of wild dogs. (music) happiness is hopping, leaping (music) (music) never sleeping, never stopping (music) You want me to eat those? You want to eat, you gotta learn to kill. Kill? Those little hoppy things? (music) legs are made for jumping (music) (music) feet are made for thumping (music) How am I supposed to do that? With your fangs and your claws. Ready to go home now? No. I'm just trying to figure out Which one will be the tastiest. (music) bunny tails like cotton (music) (music) how they got that way is long forgotten (music) Go get 'em! Ouch. Ha ha! This should teach him a lesson About living wild. "Little hoppy things." ha ha ha! Such primitive speech. Kill! (music) we could stop and worry (music) (music) why we need to hurry (music) (music) but we'd rather scurry (music) (music) in a furry flurry (music) (music) we're very happy rabbits (music) (music) we're mostly happy rabbits (music) (music) but even happy rabbits have self doubt (music) (music) temperaments audacious (music) (music) appetites voracious (music) (music) homes that aren't spacious (music) (music) make us propagatious (music) Awk! Birdo: (music) a wild dog must learn (music) (music) to kill (music) (music) some warm bunny blood (music) (music) must spill (music) (music) you're not a pampered poodle (music) (music) turn them into rabbit strudel (music) (music) 'cause you won't get a meal (music) (music) until (music) (music) you're a wild dog (music) (music) who's learned to kill (music) Ha ha ha! (music) at last you're off your leash (music) (music) now turn them to bunny quiche (music) (music) get your honker growing hotter (music) (music) make them scream for Beatrix Potter (music) (music) because you won't get a meal (music) (music) until (music) (music) you're a wild dog (music) (music) who's learned to kill! (music) (music) hunt, snarl and grunt (music) (music) run, don't have fun (music) (music) growl, howl, fight, bite (music) (music) if you want to eat your fill (music) (music) don't play with your food, go kill! (music) Awk! Well, tonight the wild dog Goes to bed hungry. I'll find some food. And just how do you plan to do that? You expect me to find you a can of liver chunks And open it with my beak? No. Here's my dinner. Right over here. Where? No, that's not food for wild dogs. That's moss. Well, it's pretty tasty. It's unnatural! Dogs don't eat moss! Reindeer eat moss. Call me Rudolph. I think it's good. Awk! Unnatural. [grunting] Birdo: Lesson number 2-- You must know how to tell Whether an animal is friendly or dangerous. That, for example, is dangerous. Aah! A house pet! Oh, yeah, that was dangerous. Why was she scared? She thought you were a house pet. We learned how awful they are. Hateful, vicious... Malicious. I'm not a house pet. I'm a wild dog. What did a house pet ever do to you? You see these scratches? They still sting. Ow! Ow! Ow! Those claws scraped across my hands. I got bit on my back leg. Who did this to you? That crazy cat. I know her. You're lucky you only got scratched. You bet! Not really. She bit off my ear. Birdo: Lesson number 3--weather. If you're going to live outside, You must endure severe, bitter weather conditions. It's most important--awk! Well, near perfect landing. Anyway, nature can be brutal, puppy. I bet those little paws are killing you. I do not have little paws, and they're just fine. Of course, it's so cold I can't really feel them. Mmm, having second thoughts about the wild life? Absolutely not! Did you know my grandfather was a Siberian husky? Ha ha ha! Well, I had a friend who was a husky. Did he teach you to watch out for ice? 'Cause it can be-- awk!--Slippery. That was just a demonstration. It's hard to smell when everything's covered with snow, But I do smell something. Well, it certainly isn't me. I wonder what it is. Can we just get back to the weather? Listen. What is it? Oh, yes. I hope you're ready for blinding snow And freezing fog. Freezing fog? It's gonna be a big one. [rumbling] Awk! Napoleon, run! Run! Awk! [neighing] Napoleon! Napoleon? Are you all right? Where are you? Napoleon? Napoleon? Oh, no. Please let him be all right. Ohh... A Storm? Blinding snow and freezing fog? It sounded like thunder. Do you realize you almost got me killed? I told you I smelled something. Ok, I made a mistake. I'm not perfect. I can't be right every time. Every time?! I'd settle for once. Where do you think you're going? Napoleon, come back here! I am not following you this time! That's just fine with me! Lesson number 4--go with your own instincts. And lesson number 5-- don't trust birdo! Wait a minute... I'm picking up something. What is it? I smell candy. I don't see any kids around. No, it can't be. I must be imagining it. Hey, but it's coming from over there In the tall grass. But how can that be? But it's definitely the smell of candy, And I'm gonna get me some! Awk! Oh, no, he's not going into the sugar cane! Not my problem. He's going to get killed in there. I'm just gonna sit here and watch. No, I can't do that! Napoleon! Where did that little puppy go? You can have your worms. I'm going for the candy. You're in danger out here. When the sugar cane gets dry-- Listen, I'm never wrong about these things. He's never right, either. Please! Mmm! He has candy where his brain should be! Let him fry. I should be going back to my flock anyway. Ohh... How can sugar cane be dangerous? He probably means I can get a few cavities. Well, I'll take my chances. Stop! Whoa! Look at my eyes. Go no further. Your eyes... Stay there. Do not move. Birdo: Napoleon! Birdo, help! Not that way! No one listens to a snake. Boy, it's getting hot. [crackling] uh-oh. I smell smoke. Where there's smoke, there's... Napoleon! Help! Napoleon! I hear you, birdo! I'm coming! Napoleon! Ooh! You're heading into the fire! Follow my voice! I'm coming. Head in the direction of my voice! [squawking] Birdo! Napoleon! Am I glad to see you! Sorry I yelled at you before. I really thought I lost you back there. I mean, you really, really scared the feathers off me. Finally... Found the yellow mouse. Now do you understand you're not ready for the wild? Birdo, I just showed you how tough I am. I can handle anything. I just don't want to see you get hurt. [growling] I mean, if anything happened to you, I'd feel responsible. I'd-- [snarls] Awk! Napoleon! Run! Cat! Run! Cat! Must destroy yellow mouse And little flying mouse. Follow me, Napoleon. Follow me. Mmm, hey, is that my flock down there? What do you know? Birdo! Birdo! [squawking] Look, it's all my brothers! Boy, am I glad to see you! Vittorio, lukino, featherico, Roberto, Marty! Hey, birdo! How you doin'? [squawking] What's all that noise? Sounds like birdo found his flock. Boy, what a noisy bunch of birds. [chattering] I should let birdo be with his flock. I've caused him enough trouble. Oh, no! Hey, watch out! The cat's behind you! Get out of there! Fly away! Great. I finally find my flock and you scare them away. Scared them? I just saved them from that cat! Napoleon, there is no cat around here-- Cat: Shut up! You have to learn to trust my instincts, birdo. Oh, mouse... For that, yellow mouse will die slow. [giggles] this kitten's really lost her mittens. Birdo! Birdo! I'm over here. Jeez, I thought you maybe flew into a rock and were dead. Aww, you were worried about me? Well, you are my best friend out here, And I know how bad you are with landings. I am great with landings. Sure. This is how you land. Who--o-oa! Oh, please. That's enough. Stop it! B-aa-awk! I am one of the greatest landers of all times. Oh, yeah, right. Ha ha ha! Birdo! Birdo: Watch this! I'll show you a landing. This happens to be one of the more Complicated landings in the history of--awk! Did you hurt yourself? Just caught a freak tailwind. Where does this road lead to? To the shore where you landed. This road can be One of the most dangerous places out here. I know all about roads. Lot of speeders on this one, And it's a lot easier to outrun a crazed cat Than a speeding--uh-oh! Better get out of there! [truck horn honks] [honk] [gasps] that lizard's not moving! Wake up! Hey! I think he's sleeping. I better help him! You stay right where you are, puppy. Hey! Get out of the road! [honking] Oh, dear. Reptilian road kill. No, I think he's all right. Let's just be on our way. But he may need help. Are you ok? Is he breathing? Hey, I'll give him a little push. Go... Away! Touchy. This is my stripe! Oh, please. He's just trying to help. That's right. Go away! I'm sorry for caring. Aw, come on, now. Don't be hurt. Bawk! Never expect gratitude from a cold-blooded creature. [dogs howling] Don't listen! Forget them, Napoleon! Go back home! I can't, birdo. I've come too far to give up now. If I turn back, I'll never know What it's really like to be wild, And I've dreamt about that my whole life. Oh, you wouldn't understand. Oh, and why not? Because you're a bird, and I'm a dog. It's a dog thing. There isn't a dog thing you do That this bird didn't teach you. I know how helpful you've been, birdo, And I'm really, really grateful, But I'm a woofer, and you're a tweeter. I can't leave you on your own. You'll never make it. Of course I will. I've had the best teacher in the whole world. I have to find my pack, and you belong with your flock.

(music) maybe our paths will meet someday (music) (music) maybe somewhere sometime (music) (music) but I have my rainbows waiting (music) (music) and he has his hills to climb (music) Napoleon: (music) I have my hills (music) (music) to climb (music) All right, now where would there be water? [grunting] ohh... Maybe that thing knows. It looks like a traveling cactus. Hey, do you know where I can find some water? Don't talk to me. Ohh... I just wanted to--ooh! Buzz off. I'm not sharing my water with anyone. I'd share my water with you. And stop looking at me! Ohh. Everyone makes fun of the way I look. Hey, I think you look sharp. You see?! Typical! No...[coughing] I mean you look cool. Anyone who makes fun of you is just jealous. I mean it. [moaning] Wait! Come back! Excuse me... What you looking for? Unh... Ohh... I can't dig if you're watching me. Unh! I'm a good digger. So what? [grunting] It'll be easier if I help. See? There's your water. Oh, thank you. But now I can't drink it! You're touching it with your dog lips! Ohh... Ouch... Ouch... Hot sand. Hot. Gotta find shade. Must be a tree somewhere. [barking] Mmm... Boop-be-de-boop. [barking] Mmm... Boop-be-de-boop. Boop-be-de-boop. Mmm... Woof. [howling] That's what's been howling? That's what I left home for? Be-loop. Be-loop. Be--[gagging] [spits] What is that thing? [spitting] Were the wild dogs I've been hearing that?! Ar-ar-aroo! Excuse me, that howling... Is that you or are there wild dogs? [clears throat] what, you mean this? Ar-ar-aroo-be-loop! Aroo! Aaah! Ha ha ha! What did you think? That was you?! Sound like a dog? I can do others. Here's an elephant. Aroo! Ha ha ha! You can smell the peanuts, huh? Listen to this. A cat. Meow. Be-loop. Please, no cats. And now-- stop! A cow. Moo! Here, a 2,000-pound cow! Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! [echoing] I am such an idiot. All this time, I've been chasing after a barking lizard. There's no wild dogs anywhere. I've been running after something That doesn't even exist. Now I've got no home... No wild life... I don't have my mother. Birdo was right. I don't have the instincts to make it out here. [crying] I'm a dumb house pet Who doesn't know a retriever from a reptile. I don't deserve the name of Napoleon. Not a crumb like me. [sobbing] I'm just a Muffin after all. [thunder] Storm! Inside! Now! Hurry! Hey, a dog. Dead? Yeah, he's dead. No, he's not, but he will be If he doesn't get out of the rain. Nobody ever died from the rain. You've never been in a desert rainstorm. Very dangerous. I'd invite you to my place, but it would be a little tight. Hey, move over! Stop pushing! Make room! I smell a dog! I hope your father doesn't bring it home. [thunder] Where can I go? Somewhere there must be a place big enough For me to fit. [thunder] [thunder] Cold, drafty, and damp. Uh-oh, my jungle instincts tell me That there's dangerous animals in here. Is it mother? Is that you, mom? Hello? No, it's a stranger. Get out or we'll attack! You're--you're puppies! Just turn around slow and leave, And no one will get hurt. I don't think he's listening. Ok, buster, on 3 I pounce! 1...2... You're in for it! 3! Grr--whoa! Whoa! Aah! I'll get him. You better--whoa-- You better watch out Or I'll tear you apart--oh! Oh! Nancy, watch out! He's coming at you! Listen! Listen! I won't hurt you. You're lost puppies like me. Mother said not to let anybody in the cave! Your mother's gone? That's great! Don't you want to play and stay up late? I think he's ok, Sid. Come on. Huh? I promise nothing bad will happen While I'm watching over you. Come on! Nothing bad, huh? So that's a good kind of flood? Huh? Flood? Nancy! Help! Sid! Help me! I can't hold on! Nancy, can you hear me? Hang onto the rock! Help! I can't hold on! Oof! Keep talking! I'll come and get you! Um, Sid, are you ok? Yeah, but where's Nancy? Help! I can't-- [coughing] Oh, no! I don't hear her! Help, Sid! Mommy! Aah! Hang on, Nancy! I'm going to save her! No, no! I'll go! Where are you, Nancy? I'm over here! Keep yelling! I'll follow your voice! I hear you! Hurry! Hurry! Don't let go, Nancy! I'm over here, but this rock is slippery! Keep talking, Nancy, I hear you! I hear you, too! Hurry! Please, hurry! The water's getting higher! You're gonna be fine, Nancy. How? Climb on my back. I'll get you outta here. I don't want to! I'm scared! You're safe with me. You said nothing would happen while you were watching us! Nancy, climb on my back. [panting] now! Ok. Whoa! Nancy! Get away! I'm fine here! You'll be underwater in a minute! Get on my back! I'll fall in! I won't let you drown, I promise. Pretend I'm a boat. All aboard! 1...2... 3! Ok, here we go, sailing up the River. Don't let go! You're just like a sea captain, You know that, Nancy? Hang on, Nancy! Napoleon: A brave sea captain! Don't let go of him, Nancy! I'm slipping! Hang on to your boat. Almost at your dock. My dock? Sure. Every boat has a dock. This one's yours. She's slipping! Ok, let go of me, Nancy, and grab onto the dock. It's slippery! You can do it. Your front legs are for pulling, Your back legs are for pushing. Now push! Push! He did it! Do this, Nancy. Brr! Get rid of all the water. Like this? Nancy, look who's back! It's a wild dog. Of course it is. It's our mother! I can't believe it. [gasps] I've been with the wild dogs all along. [woman's voice] Sid? Nancy? Are you all right? Mother: Who's this? Gosh! How long was I out? Whole night. I never got to thank you for saving me. Mother: I'm the one who should be grateful. How can I thank you for saving my little darlings? I wanna stay with you, Be a wild dog. What about your home? I belong here. Sid: Oh, can't he stay? Nancy: Oh, mommy, please let him stay. Mother: Of course he can. I'm a wild dog. At last! I knew this is where I belonged. This can be his new home until he sorts things out. Sid and Nancy: Yay! Nancy: We can play new games! Sid: And do new tricks! Nancy: Yay! [chuckles] You jump in. I wanna be Napoleon. It's my turn. You were Napoleon last time. Nancy: Was not? Sid: Was too! I think they're very fond of you. [arf] We've been in here a long time. When do we get to howl and hunt and stuff? Wake up, Napoleon. Today's the day. And it'll be just the 2 of us. I'm right behind ya. Isn't he just the coolest? He's ok. Tell me, child, Why did you leave home? I wanted to go where there were no rules. And what did you find? Well, I found a lot of rules About living with other animals And being on your own. And what did you want to do out here? I wanted to hunt my food and kill it. And did you enjoy that? No. I ate moss instead. Hmm. Anything else you wanted? Well, I wanted to stay up late And have fun all the time. And did you have fun all the time? No. Sometimes it was scary, And lots of times I was lonely. Then why do you want to be out here? I wanna be a wild dog So I can be really brave and fearless. But you've been that all along. You couldn't have come this far Without being fearless. And it was your bravery That saved Sid and Nancy. In your heart, You've been a wild dog all along, Napoleon. Guess I have. Is there something more you want? Well... Yes. Tell me. I want... I want... To go home. I miss my mom. What if I told you I had a friend who could take you back? Really? Come along. (music) kangaroo!

Lorikeets: I can run fearless across waterfalls. I can run fearless across waterfalls. Napoleon: Little birds suck. Little birds su... Hey! Now what do I do? There's gotta be a way to get back. There it is! My home! How can I get across the water? Yes! There's the answer. Look at that! Amazing! It's still there. I'll just go back the way I came. Hello. Who's out there? Hello! Excuse me, but this is my basket. I came over in it. It's my basket. My basket! It is not! Now, go on. Out! Hey, quit your shoving! Hey, quit your shoving. I'm sorry. You're a long way from home, aren't you? My family came on vacation, But I wanna streak through the water like a shark, Stalk my prey like a tiger. I am Conan, Killer penguin! I am young! I'm alive! I want more from life than tundra. I'm not ever gonna go back. Sounds like you Haven't learned where your home is. Penguin: My home is wherever there's excitement And adventure. Tough talk for a puny penguin. Ha ha ha. Hey, watch who you call puny. Look, I was a lot like you. I thought I had to run away So I could be a wild beast. Is this gonna be a long story? Hey, just listen, ok? It all started at a party in my... I learned my lesson, And you will, too. Now, I'm gonna get in this thing, And--and wait for the tide to come in. Unh. Go ahead. I don't need the basket. Conan is never leaving. [noisy voices] What's that? What--oh, no! Oh, no! It's my mother! I am telling you he came down here! Quick! You gotta hide me! Mother: Pengi! Maybe I can hide behind these rocks. Pengi! Oh, no! Too late! Pengi, come home with us. I don't need this aggravation! Father: What are you, nuts? You trying to give us all a heart attack? My name's not Pengi, it's Conan, And I'm not leaving! Pengi? Ha ha ha! Everyone, just leave me alone! Father: This is the worst vacation we've ever taken. Mother: It is not the worst vacation. What about Alaska? Remember Alaska? The otter gave you a cough. What about Alaska? Ha ha! Hey, Pengi, wait up! No one understands! Mother: Some vacation! Every night was formal night. Oh, a dog! Just what I need. Father: What is that, a dog? Sibling: Dog! Look out! Father: Get away from me, you ball of fluff! You flea hotel! Mother: Would you calm down? Your blood pressure. Would you calm down. Calm down! Calm down! Napoleon: Look, guys, If you can't convince Pengi to go home, Then I will. Mother: He won't listen! It's like talking to an iceberg. Pengi, you're staying with me tonight! Father: Don't you have a cousin named iceberg? Mother: That's Weisberg. Weisberg! Weisberg! Forget it. Still think this is where you belong, huh? You betcha. Anyone gets in my way, I'm gonna give them some of this! Make 'em beg for mercy. Hey, I like a good brawl. Trust me, You're better off at home. Go back to where you belong. Back to icebergs and permafrost? Forget about it. This is my time to howl. Awoo! You're worn out and tired. Hup. You had your fling in the wild. But I'm gonna live. I'm gonna find my adventure. Woof! Woof, woof, woof! [growling] That sound, could it be... Hello? Somebody else up here? [growl] She's back! Pengi! Anyone for thrills? Quiet, dummy. Pengi: I may come from the cold, But I'm hot for action. [growling] [thunder] Gotta save that dumb bird! Time to rid my house of the mouse. All right. Come on. Let's go hunt down a few. But I've found one. An unusual black and white mouse. Leave the penguin alone! Well, if it isn't Muffin mouse. [hisses] Huh? The mouse dies! Well, there is such a thing as too much adventure. Just you and me now, wacko. Seems unfair, 9 lives against one. I gotta get her near the water. [growling] Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! Come on! Bull's-eye! Huh? [hissing] You'll pay for that! Ok. It's payday. [growling] Come on! Come after me! [hissing] No. Running out of lives? Still have plenty more! Come, let me slash you! Ooh! S-slash you with my... Aah! Oh!

Ha ha ha! Ohh... That's it. No more games. Games? Look down, rodent. What? There's your cold, blue death. Well, thanks just the same. I'm not in the mood for a moonlight swim. Jump, mousie! Look, you left your home and gone mad. [hisses] I'm a pet dog. I made the same mistake. [hisses] Living in the wild has made you see mice everywhere. You wanna be home catching real mice. [hisses] But I am at home. Napoleon: You are insane. And I don't want you in my house! Yo! Fraidy-cat! You wanna fight me? What?! I'll peck your eyes out! I'll flap your face in! You're next!

I thought you might be here. Napoleon: I'm trying to find my way home. Finally came to your senses, eh? Turtle: Don't you ever clip your toenails? Hmmph. A snapping turtle. Looks like I wasn't wrong about everything. No, you were right all along. I don't know how to get back. Napoleon: So long, birdo! Don't forget to visit! Birdo: I'll fly over during migration! See you around, uh, what was it? Napoleon? You're the best bird in the world, birdo-- And I'm never wrong about these things! [clucking] I'm gonna miss that puppy.
