Don't touch her! - Please don't hurt us. - Go, go, go! What have you done? Shut up! Come on, guys, let's go! What are you doing? No way, no way. My first time will not be in your car. Period. If you loved me you would. I never told you I loved you. Well, I love you. Let's go get Brian. You're late. - So what? - So I got off 20 minutes ago. I'm just sitting around, my aunt puts me back to work. Blame him. Hi, my name is Carla. Can I get you something to drink? We heard that the peach cobbler is out of this world. It is. It's my grandmother's recipe. We'll take two of those and two coffees, please. Great. Aren't you the ones that moved into the Turner house? Yep, yesterday. - That's a beautiful home. - Oh, thank you. But I'm hearing about these home invasions that are going on in that neighborhood. I know. Three this month. My advice? Get a dog. My wife's just rattled easily. I'm sorry, but we just moved in to the neighborhood, and he'll be gone on Thursday night. And I don't wanna be alone. Call me crazy. There's nothing crazy about it, but try not to get too worked up. This is really a very peaceful place. I'll be back with your coffees. - Thank you. - Thank you. Do you need to discuss that with everyone? All that money, it should be somewhere safe. We should've never brought it with us. - It's stupid. - I'll find a safe place for it. When? Did you hear those people talk about the money? Yeah, it sounds like he's in the mob. Why would he move here if he was in the mob? Don't get comfortable, kids. It's time to go. Sam, you're being a dick. No, I'm not. This is my house. If you don't like it, move back to Vermont with Mom. - We're not doing anything. - Yet. Don't try to play me. I'm not stupid. Next thing you know, her daddy will be dropping by, giving me shit. Move it. Let's go. You are such an asshole. Yep. Nice to see you, Kerry. Thanks for stopping by. So guess what we saw at the Turners' place today. - What? - Those new folk... got a big ol' box of cash. - What do you mean? - Just what the fuck I said. They got a big ol' box of cash. I fucking hate him. Well, this oughta make you feel better. Where'd you score that? Some guy over in Littleton. What guy? Why? Does it matter? It's the third time this week. Well, you don't have to do any. I love you, baby. Where the hell have you been? - I was out with friends. - It is 2:30 in the morning. Daddy, I'm 18. It's not like I'm a kid. What have you been doing? - Jesus, Dad. - What have you been doing?! I cannot wait to go to school and get the fuck out of here. We're not sending you to college so you can have a good time. Oh, come... You're not sending me anywhere! I got a full academic scholarship on my own, thank you. While you're in this house, you follow our rules. - Is that clear? - Why is she talking? Why are you talking? You're not my mother. No, but I did help raise you for the last four years. Right, and you're pissed that nobody gave you a medal for it. Hey! I just wanna be normal. Everyone has fun. Why can't I? You're not everyone. This whole town watches us. We have to set an example. No, Daddy, you do. Kerry, I'm not stupid! What is that supposed to mean? I'm... not... stupid. You're not missing work again. Go to bed. Police department. No, Mrs. Harris, we don't move furniture. Uh-huh, bye. Kerry, don't forget to file those reports from last week. Jeff, I'm heading up to the hospital to see how Don is doing. Kerry, those reports. Do you guys have any leads? Same as last week. Ski masks and a gun. They got cash and jewelry. Police department. I hate my life. Come on. Summer hasn't even started. My dad is being such an asshole. Well, that's who he is. You don't even know him. What? I'm agreeing with you. Kerry? Where have you been? - Hey. - Seriously, it's been forever. Look, there's a party Thursday night at... We're busy. I'm talking to her. We'll see. Just give me a call. You don't return calls anymore. Well, there's your answer. Shouldn't you be changing someone's oil? Shouldn't you be giving Ricky a hand job behind the Dumpster? Yeah. I heard about that. Don't pay any attention to him, Karen. Fine. Bye, Kerry. Bye! Bye, guys. What's up? Nothing much. Hey. Hey. Look, that party Thursday night's gonna be pretty big. Yeah? So I think I'm gonna go. I have plans for us tomorrow night. Yeah, I'm not really into it. You don't even know what we're doing yet. Look, I think my dad knows. He doesn't know. - Well, if he does, I'm dead. - We all are. He doesn't know. Look, I think... I think we should just lay low for a while. Kerry, you know I'm tired of you acting like you're always doing me a favor by hanging out. Go to your bullshit party. I don't care. Oh! Where do you think you're going? Sit still! Please don't hurt me. Where is the money? What money? Where is the fucking money?! Search the rest of the house. Take everything. Turn the lights on. Hey! You're in deep shit, lady. We've been waiting for you. I swear I'll shoot you right now! Your will is mine. Do not fight. We bind this soul to the debt of our ancestors. Bind the eyes of all that see. You shall not speak of this beyond this moment. You shall not make known the content of this night with use of your hands. You are bound. And so it is. You will do as you're told. You cannot resist. Drink. I call upon the guardian of the gate. I summon you. Come forth and witness our rite. Please! If you just... May the power of our ancestors enter this vessel. May the power of our ancestors enter this vessel. You can go home now. You're gonna let us go? Of course. Go. We'll see you soon, okay? What did he mean, he'd see me soon? What the fuck? Why me? Open the car. Open the car. Unlock the fucking car! Get the fuck off me! Are you coming in? What you put out, you get back. That is who we are. This is dark magic. It is. That is the curse of our ancestors. There has to be another way. David, you know how this will play out. You will fulfill your destiny. There is no choice. You gonna be okay? Yeah. Maybe we should tell your dad. After what that guy just did to us, are you crazy? What else do we do, wait? - Shit. - It is 4:30 in the morning! I don't care what the excuse is. You have crossed the line. And you get the fuck outta here! Get inside! Go to bed! Where were you? I know exactly what she's been doing. Oh, you think I haven't heard the whole town talking? Making an ass out of me. My own daughter! Martin! Listen to me, Kerry. This shit stops tonight. Do you hear me? I will haul your ass off to rehab myself if I have to. What?! I'm sorry. I'm sorry! - I'm sorry! - Okay, okay, okay. What is it? Did Sean do something to you? Jesus. Okay, okay. You get some sleep. We'll talk later. Okay, okay, okay. It's okay. You okay? Come here. You knew this wouldn't be easy. Oh, shh. You ever gonna get up? I'll be up in a minute. Sean? Sean? What are you guys doing here? You didn't answer your phone. We were worried. Are you okay? If it wasn't for me... I shouldn't have dragged us into that house. It's all my fault. Hate to break up this tender moment, but this is no longer a safe space for you guys. What are you talking about? Your dad came to the shop and threatened to kill my brother. That's what I'm talking about. He threatened to shoot him in the head if he so much as looked at you. What the fuck happened last night? So last night I tried to tell my aunt. I couldn't. It was as if my throat didn't work. Me too. We weren't properly introduced last night. I'm David. Let's take a walk, you and I. No. - Yes. - You can't just... Would you like to have a conversation outside? Let's go. What did he say, exactly? He said that we were gonna be spending a lot of time together. And he's gonna take me to lunch tomorrow. This is crazy. I think we just need to get the fuck out of town. Okay? Maybe go to my mom's place in Vermont. But the guy with the beard said... We can't let them do whatever it is they wanna do with us! I mean, I can't even tell anyone. I tried. My brother thinks I'm holding out on him. When do you wanna leave? Now. You sure about this? No. Oh, God, I hope he gets some food. It's a good trick, right? Kerry is going home now. No. - No. - Come on, honey. No. It's okay. You shouldn't have done that. Your energy is very closed. Have you always been like that? No. I'm not hungry. - How about some iced tea? - No. Is this funny to you? I'm sorry. I've never had sex with anyone outside of my family. I'm a little nervous. This is my first date. This is not a date. Well, sure it is. No. This is kidnapping. - You're so angry. - Yeah, damn right, I'm angry! What planet did you grow up on? I grew up on this planet. Why would you ask such a question? Because you're so fucked up. That's why. She's a horrible, horrible person. What did you expect? But I tried to make it pleasant. You put your hands on her in a sexual manner two days after she was raped. While you watched. What were you doing? I'm supposed to be her boyfriend. No, you're not. You're supposed to make it look like you're her boyfriend. Stop by her job to say hi. Take her out to lunch so everyone sees you together. You don't try and have sex with her. I didn't mean it that way. You're so awkward, David. All I've ever known are the elders. Her youth is intoxicating. Well, snap out of it. David. Do you know what went wrong today? No. You lost control. I did. You let your feelings get in the way, and she saw it as weakness. Let her know fear. I could kill you and everyone you know in an afternoon. If you ever speak to me as you did today, you'll regret it. Is that clear? I had a dream last night. About them. They were holding that doll thing and chanting over me. It was just a dream. But when I woke up, there was something in my room. I couldn't see it. It was in the shadows just... watching me. What was? Kerry, they're coming for me. I can feel it. Shh. Please. I didn't mean to break into your house. I know. It was Sean. It's always Sean, isn't it? He ruins everything. He got Kerry. Even though he couldn't love her like you. Nobody cares about you. Your own mother took her life and left you behind. She didn't even love you. You've always been the weak one. You've always known it, haven't you? You're so much like your mother. Get the drugs, Brian. Tonight's the last time. Go on. You're safe now. Shh. Shh. Thank you. He was a good kid. When my sister passed, I told myself I would take care of him. - Now look. - No. Don't talk like that. I didn't even know. You were wonderful with him. I'm so sorry. - Call us if you need anything. - Thank you. How you doing? I can't talk to you. He'll know. Sean, what is this? It's how you kill them. Wait, how... How do you... We can't talk. I wanna know what the hell is going on. What kind of trouble are you guys in? I gotta go. New boyfriend. You didn't waste any time, did you? Does he have anything to do with this? Whatever. I'm sorry, Kerry. I know he was your friend. Thanks. I gotta go. Kerry, we found a gun on the floor of Brian's bedroom. Do you know why he would need one of those? No. Why would I know? I think you know a lot more than you're letting on. I don't. Kerry, I'm starting to put the pieces together, and I don't like what I'm seeing. Whatever it is that you're involved in... stops right now. Am I clear? Do you hear me?! Then promise me. I promise. Oh, my God. Sean, I've called you four times. Call me back. Hi. Do you need to speak to a counselor? Okay. Just fill out these forms and someone will be with you in just a minute. Hello, Kerry. Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna keep the baby, and there's nothing you can do about it. Okay? I guess we're done then. How? You're charmed. No harm will ever come to you as long as you live. Come with me. But why me? What did I do to you? Let's just say we're in tune with certain vibrations. People's actions or intentions carry a very specific energy, and we connect to that. What does that mean? We look for people who do not have regard for themselves or others. Drug addicts, criminals. So why are you telling me all this? Because it's cruel to let you struggle with questions you cannot answer. And it's not like you can tell anyone. So Brian? That... was unfortunate. And Sean? I think that's enough for today. But... I think you should seriously ask yourself how much you really want to know. I wanna know everything. Do you? Is that man with the beard your dad? No. He's my cousin. We're all cousins. Where are your parents? I was taken from them at birth and raised by Sarita and the elders. Why? To prepare me. There is a prophecy in my family that says I will lead my people to a higher plane. You? Don't look so surprised. My birth was foretold. It coincides with the ritual. The ritual? This. Everything that is happening is the ritual. Are you gonna kill the baby? Yes. That is my initiation. I must perform the ritual myself in order to fulfill my destiny. I should get you home. People's actions or intentions carry a very specific energy, and we connect to that. Everything that is happening is the ritual. You will keep the baby, and there's nothing you can do about it. What are you doing here? I've come to see your parents. Why? We have to tell them about the baby. They have to believe we're going to put it up for adoption. Sorry. Stop saying sorry! You're not sorry! None of you are. Are you fucking kidding me? I'm sorry, Daddy. Why don't you just stab me in the heart? Okay. Do you know what you're gonna do? We're going to put the baby up for adoption. What about school? I'm gonna put that on hold for a little while. A little while means forever. You know that, right? We just think it's the wrong time for us at this point. How old are you anyway? 24. 24? Do you know that she just turned 18? All right, everyone calm down. I think it would be best if we just took a moment to think about all of the options available to you, okay? Options? Yes, options. Adoption is one. I don't believe in abortion. You don't have to carry the baby, you little prick! Is this funny to you? When we were kids, Brian and I built a fort right up over that ridge. We had a little club, and a bunch of us would go and hang out there. Did you have a lot of friends growing up? No. We're... We're friends, right? Yes. No. I wish things could be different. - Maybe they can be. - They can't. Why not? 200 years ago, a distant cousin of mine made a pact with a demon to give our family unlimited power. He was greedy and didn't realize he was binding our whole family to darkness. In exchange, every 25 years, we must sacrifice four human lives, one being a member of our own family. Our blood runs through your baby's veins. He is family and will be sacrificed accordingly. So what if you don't do any of this? The demon will kill every living member of my family. Where is the rest of your family? They are scattered throughout, in every state. Raul and the women are chosen for their skills, and we are trained by the elders in the place where I was raised. Sam, Sam, look out! Sean, what the fuck is going on? I got your text. How are you? Have you been having any weird dreams lately? You still have that paper I gave you? Yeah. That symbol. It's called the seal of containment. The only time they don't have power is when they're in the center of that thing. And if you can get one of them inside it, you can kill them. How do you know this? The Internet. They're witches. What else could they be? It's really good to see you. I should go. Sean. If you could know what was gonna happen, would you want to? Why? No. Chill out, man. It's a phase. He's a teenager. I don't know. My gut's telling me that Kerry's new boyfriend is in the middle of this. I heard he's not even their kid. Don't be crazy, man. Somebody is scaring the shit out of my brother, and I aim to find out who. Speaking of shit and stepping in it. Someone gonna buy me a drink? You ain't even old enough to be in here. Okay, Randy. What are you drinking? Something strong. All right. Dude, you gotta talk about this shit sooner or later. Hey there. Hey. Hey, little brother. Drink up. No, thanks. Can we go home? Now? Yeah, I don't feel well. I came with Travis. You go on. I'll take your brother home. He's going through something. What? I don't know. He won't tell anyone. Bottom's up. All right, motherfuckers. Sam! Are you home? Sam? You stay away from me! Shh. It's all right now. Don't fight it. You're going to write a note. Three cuts. The long way. Acepte este ofrenda. Why aren't you at the funeral? Sam doesn't want me there. I guess Sean left a note saying he couldn't live without me. Very dramatic. Valencia told me you didn't live among my kind. No. We prefer to live separate from mainstream society. It deadens the soul. How'd you choose me? Some of us specialize in tracking energy. Valencia is a tracker. She found you. There were other factors involved as well. Like what? You were a virgin. There were three of you. You hurt people and abused yourselves. It was an optimal situation. Are you gonna kill me? Why am I the only voice of reason around here, huh? Look, if by some long shot, those folks are responsible for this shit, what the fuck you gonna do about it? My brother is dead. I know. Hi. Hi. - Where you been hiding? - Here and there. Okay, well, see you later. Can we go inside? You know my real mom died when I was a kid. Cancer. Yes. That's why Brian and I are so close. Were. Do you think I'll see her when... No. David? Have you ever been in love? That's a shame. 'Cause you're very handsome. Is there someplace we can go? What did you say? Shh. You're mine now. I am. - Should we be doing this? - You don't want to? I do. I just... Are you okay? David's house is right through those trees. Let's go back to the car, man. This is stupid. Don't be such a pussy. We're just taking a look. Nothing wrong with that. Why do I listen to crazy motherfuckers? I don't know. Why? This is bullshit, I'll tell you that. What is that? It's okay. It's gonna be all right. What's happening? He is among us tonight. In the flesh? He is protecting us, that is all. Yes. You should take Kerry home now. - Get your things. - I don't get it. If this thing is on your side, then why are you all so freaked out by it? It is unsettling to be around such darkness. It cannot be trusted. Let's just get the car and drive. Seriously. We could be together forever. Just the two of us. Would you like that? She's bound by blood. There can be no one else. But what if... She is bound by magic. We cannot change that. There has to be another way. I understand you did not choose your fate, David. But here you are. And mark my word, you will see this through to the letter. That is final. Yes, sir. It was a warning. Exactly. I can feel your energy. You enjoy this. No, David, I accept it. Look at what happened to those men last night. You saw the bodies. And that's what will happen to us all if we don't fulfill the prophecy. The darkness does not care about right or wrong. It cares about blood. You must be mindful, David. Every decision has a consequence. And I for one am not about to have my heart ripped out and eaten because you want a girlfriend. David. You're too important to us. Our family needs you. I just want this to be over. In time, cousin. So... why didn't you just kidnap me and keep me in a room somewhere? Why all this? In the beginning, that's how it was done. But living day-to-day with someone became difficult. Energetically, when... It's hard to kill somebody you care for. Yes. Ooh! What is it? It just kicked. He's strong. Don't. - David? - Yes. Why couldn't you just cast a spell on me and make me think I was having fun? We're not allowed. It feeds on fear. That is part of the requirement. When it's time for... Can you promise me it won't hurt? I promise it will be painless. You have my word. What's the surprise? My parents are out, and I wanted to do something special for us before... Kerry. Oh, it's almost time. The baby will be here any day and... I just wanna think about something else, so come on. What's that? It's a surprise. I have to blindfold you. Okay, we're gonna go upstairs, so watch your step, okay? Here we go. What are you doing? I have to. Nothing personal. I take back my promise. It will hurt. What was I supposed to do? The baby is here, David. It'll all be over soon. Have you heard from David? - Do you want me to call him? - I don't want him here. You having second thoughts? The adoption isn't final. If you wanna re... No! Hey there. Hey. How do you feel? Okay. It's only been a few days. You've been through a lot. I love you. I love you too, honey. Sam, do you remember David? Yes. You will do everything he tells you to. Now rise. I want you to do something for me. Okay. And you can't let anyone or anything stop you. Hey, girl, where you been? Hiding. What can I get you? Um... peach cobbler. Good choice. Coming right up. Thank you. Hey, Sam. Sam! Sam, no! Sam! - Sam, no. - Sam, stop! No! What the fuck are you doing? He's gonna kill her! Oh, my God. She's dead. I need backup at the town diner. We got two people down. Repeat, backup at the town diner. Are you ready, David? I am. You're about to enter a world beyond time. Outside the realm of your human life. Do you enter freely? I do. We offer you to the spirit that makes us whole. This is the charge of our coven. And so it is. What is the meaning of this? May you find peace, special boy. You were right, you know? What you put out does come back to you. That's why you had to kill them all. I'm sorry, David. Wait. I don't under... We shall name him David. Let us begin the enchantment.
