THE MAN ON THE TRAIN A fine dancer this Mrs... Mrs. what? - Zerbini. - Jenny Zerbini. A beautiful woman! You don't like her? - She infatuated my brother who sent her here tonight and now she hit on your husband, too. Nonsense! It's twelve thirty. Let this record play out. Yes, but we won't wake up early! It's only 3 hrs to Epidavros, Eleni and the festival opens at 7 pm. Let them have fun. Ladopoulos was a nag and now look at him! Well... let's wrap it up, people. And no dawling, eh? Everyone be ready by six tomorrow. Goodnight, Mado dear! Thank you very much! Goodnight. I forgot! My wife's feeling much better and she'll join us. At 6, then. Goodnight and thank you for a wonderful evening. I'll walk with you. Ah, Ladopoulos! You'll pick us up here at home, OK? Yes, you'll be the last ones to pick up. Goodnight. - May I come in? - Of course. You're babying me. You'll end up spoiling me. What should I wear? - Anything would look good on you. - You're intolerable. Button me up. Are the Ladopouloi coming? - Well, they said so last night. Unless the pretty lady is angry after... It's them! They're here. Ready? - Yes. Shall we? Let me check on the children. - Again? But you only just did. They're still asleep. It's almost midday! Are they coming or not? Don't get angry, your blood pressure will go up. Oh, come on, people! Where are you? Come on, come on! It's a 4-hour drive! And we have to make a stop and get a bite, too. - Ready to go? - Yes. - You'll ride with us? - Gladly! You don't mind leaving your husband? Bah! He's in really good hands now! - Darling, they separated us. - Never mind, darling. A good thing, flirting! Riding without our wives will be more fun. - We'll switch at the first stop. - Have a safe ride! Start the car. No speeding! - A pretty woman, this Zerbini. - Very! Looks like your husband thinks so, too. We have the same taste. Why leave this professional seductress near your husband? Don't be silly. Here's our chance to strech our legs. You over there! Won't you get out, too? How can you be so in love with him after ten years of marital life? You would know if he was your husband. What is it, Mado? For God's sake, what's the matter? Over there! What's there? He is! Mado! What's wrong? Some water. What's the matter? You need some water? - How are you, darling? - Got some cologne? - Here's water! - It's nothing, is it? - The curves, no doubt. - No speeding, I told you! - Sorry for causing trouble. - You serious? - Don't talk nonsense, Mado! - How you feeling? Fine. I felt dizzy suddenly, perhaps the Kinetta curves... Then we can move on? We're good? - Lean on me. - As good as new! Perhaps I should ride with you? No, thanks, I'm perfectly well. No need to make a fuss of a simple dizzy spell. Well, if you say so. Start the car, go. - What did you see, Mado? - Where? On the passing train. What frightened you? Nothing. Are you sure the rooms in Bourtzi are reserved? I wired them. I have their answer, too. Your counting on Ladopoulos may have us all sleeping outdoors tonight. Here it is. "Five rooms reserved". Unbelievable! - How are you feeling? - Great! Perhaps you find Bourtzi boring? Its loneliness in the middle of the sea thrills me. We'll check you all in. Don't forget out meeting at 6.30 sharp on Nafplio beach. - What time's the play? - At 7.30. It's 30 kms to the theatre. Whoever's late, we won't wait for them. He's referring to you two. It's wonderful here! You feeling better now? - Quite well. - Au revoir then, let's freshen up a bit. - By all means. I can't stomach this Zerbini. "You feeling better now?" Such a femme fatale! She didn't take her eyes off your husband for a minute. Surely you noticed? - Don't be silly. Mado... What about the train incident? I told you. The ride got me dizzy. I fainted, that's all. How lovely it is here! As if we're suddenly back in time. Years back. - How do you mean? Don't you see? - Is this the real reason? - What else? - Perhaps I could help you? - With what? Nothing's the matter. All set! If you want, darling, we can go up to our room. Don't forget the unbending Ladopoulos! 6.30 sharp at the beach. Otherwise you go to Evidavros on your own. - All right! I didn't expect Ladopoulos to manage so well. What do you say? He's much better than his wife implies. - Are you happy with this excursion? - Very! - What's the opening play at the festival? - "Medea". Yannis must be furious. He's brought the beautiful Mrs. Zerbini along to win her heart but she only has eyes for you! She's a simpleton. No, darling, she's no simpleton. She simply has good taste. Is there anything you'd like to tell me? Yes. To help me get dressed. Behave! I wonder why you accepted to marry a geriatric like me. A geriatric who's also idiotic. Come on now, we'll be late. Thanks. See? I'm on time. It's 6.40 and they're not here yet as agreed. - We can't leave them behind. - They have a car, we can meet there. I've come 200 kms to see the festival. I can see Katelanos' marital love affair anytime. We're leaving! Some husbands are annoyingly in love, don't you think? And some wives annoyingly clever, don't you think? Hey, Eleni, they can't help it. Those two are on permanent honenymoon. See? You don't even see their motorboat, yet! "Gone is the value of oaths..." "And shame's gone, too." "The waters in the sacred rivers are flowing in reverse..." "Yes... Justice!" "And all things turned upside down." "Men's plans are now deceitful..." "their firm trust in the gods is gone." "Gone is the value of oaths..." "and shame's gone, too." "...and from the flowing river of the lovely Cephissus..." "shall sweet temperate winds arise..." - Is anything wrong? - No, nothing. "...breathing down upon the land..." "while she binds within her hair..." "garlands of roses ever sweet-smelling..." "sending Love to sit at Wisdom?s side..." "...to foster all fine things." Dimitris, I would rather not go down to the dining hall. - Won't you eat? - No, I'd rather go to bed. - We'll have the meal brought here. - A shame to spoil the group's fun... I care about you, not them. I'll order a light meal and be right back. Food's been taken care of. But why stay in the dark? Put it over there. I'm always your friend, right? If something is... or ever goes wrong... will you want me to help you? - Yes. A fine day! The sea's sparkling. Well, today I need to catch more than 4 okes. Either a grouper or a large dentext. Got 8 mouths to feed! Don't scold me, darling, I won't go swimming today. I'll rest here in a chaise longue. I don't feel quite myself today! It's all right, darling. Let's stay. We'll wait for them here. We won't be eating any fish, though. We'll get by like every day. Oh, no, I wouldn't dream of spoiling your fun. You go with them. After all, we're not newlyweds. They'll laugh at us. The two of us at the theatre last night or at supper, it's not right. If you stay they'll all think I'm jealous of pretty Mrs. Zerbini! Here you go. - Are you jealous? - A little. - May I come in? - Yes, Eleni. - You sleepyheads! Everyone's ready. - Mado's not coming with us. We'll talk about that. Come on, they're waiting. My incredible husband is still asleep. Come on, we're running late. - What about Ladopoulos? - Let's leave him! 'Bye. - No second thoughts? - No, I'll stay. I want to rest. Eleni, you're holding us up! It's noon already. Ouch! My foot! What happened? I think I've twisted it. We'll have to postpone, then. No need, you go ahead! I'll stay with Mado. - Are you alright? - Yes, I'm alright. Goodbye! Goodbye! And the fish, Dimitris! No less than 4 okes, eh? Looks like my wife's got tired of me. - Why don't you swim here? - Ever seen any fishermen swim? Never! Swimming is a ritual. If the sea's at your feet, it's not at all interesting. I'll get some breakfast. - Why all this foot comedy? - Because I'm worried. Why did you stay, Mado? Whom are you expecting? What are you expecting? We've been friends for so long with no secrets between us. Why won't you tell me the truth? Who's the man that scares you? Mado, Eleni, come! When shall we eat? Our friend's hungry. Let's not torture him anymore. - Come on, girls! I'm famished! - Don't eat much this morning. My husband promised us fish soup for... What's wrong, Mado? Nothing. Oh, great! Those gentlemen who were only just here are staying at your hotel? The one in grey is. The other one is a friend of his, from Nafplio. He seemed familiar but I'm not sure. You remember his name? Of course, it's Mr. Depontis. A fine gentleman. Depontis?... Thank you. No, it's not the one I thought. An acquaintance perhaps? At first I thought so, but... ... he wasn't. He's a stranger. Happens all the time. I was once asking for some doctor's advice about my liver and finally I realised that the man was a notary! - Think I'll go to my room. - Won't you eat? I have no appetite. Perhaps you're saving it for your husband's fish soup? If your wife saw you eating like this... That's why I stayed behind, so that she won't. - Don't you ever lose your appetite? - Sure, when I'm ill. - Are you often ill? - Never. Mado is sad about her husband leaving. I bet she's jealous of the pretty lady your brother brought along. You understand everything. Yorgo! Madam? You need something, madam? I beg your pardon. I mistook you for someone I knew. An old friend. A very old friend. I beg your pardon. We can't miss each other in Bourtzi. It's too small for that. Why won't you talk to me, Mado? What's the matter? Who is this man? - I don't know. Then why do you get so exited? He reminds you of someone? - Yes. - Whom? You're not sure. - No. Then talk to him. Doubt is the worst of all things. I spoke to him. And I don't know anything. I'm not sure about anything. He behaved as if he was meeting me for the first time. But still... Still... Everything about him is so similar to that other one. His body, his eyes, his face... Only this time it's not as joyful as that other time. I can't bear it, Eleni. I can't take it anymore. What was that man for you, Mado? Did you love him? Was it too long ago? 14 years. 14 years! That many. And if this stranger looks like that man, why do you get so excited? Don't you love your husband? - Very much, you know that. - Aren't you happy with him? - Yes, but you can't understand this. - What happened to that man? - He died. At least that's what I believed until yesterday. Listen, Mado. Your nerves are shaken. You love your husband, you call him "the most perfect man in the world". You have your children, your status, a good, comfortable life. Why should the ghost of on old love affair upset you? We've all had a love affair once that ended one way or another. You'll ruin your life because of some resemblance? Put follies aside, Mado. Your husband will be here in a few hours and he must not understand anything about this crazy story. Come on, wash your face. You want to talk to me about him? Yes. Now I cannot but talk to you. It was long before I met you and my husband. The second year of the Occupation. A time when our head was full of dreams, ideas and anticipation. Anticipation for what was coming. One evening, I stayed late at a friend's party. When I was leaving, it was about curfew time and I had to hurry up. I believe we're saved, Miss. - Were you scared? - Very! Me too! Another roundup, eh? Won't you come inside until you make sure they're gone? Thank you. Have a seat. They haven't gone yet. They must be looking for someone. They're knocking on the doors. I didn't yet know that his life was a never-ending game with death. Looks like they're after somebody. They think he's hiding in the neighbourhood. They're checking houses one by one. Cigarette? Thank you. - Are you scared? - Very! I'm also thinking of home. They'll go crazy. Perhaps you have something to hide? They'll come here, too. They're across the street. We're next. How can someone leave your house? I can account for you as my nephew. I do have a nephew who visits here. - I'll harm you. I must leave. - All right, then. Come! They killed him! That's how I saw him for the first time. In a game with death. The Germans were polite. The old man was a musician and had made studies in their country. - What about him? - I knew nothing about him. The next morning after the curfew ended I went home. My family were sick with worry. There are some things one cannot explain, Eleni. I didn't know his name. I had only seen him for a few moments. Yet his image would not leave my mind. What kind of man was that, who was smiling like a child, yet his face could so suddenly turn cruel? The next day I thought of him a lot. And that afternoon I went to the musician's house again. There she is! All's well? Are we all right? - Thank you! - Were they frightened at home? - Sick with fear! - Won't you come in? - No, thank you. I only wanted to know if... - What? - Did you hear anything about him? - No. Truth is I asked around. But they gave me the most contradictory answers. One was that the Germans were looking for someone, who got away. Another was that they killed someone. In fact, nobody knows because they'd all been hiding in their homes. We're living in such times... We were living in such times and I in such a state. It was really strange. That man with the pistol... I was thinking of him all the time. A month passed. Then, one day... - Remember me? - But of course! - Only I thought that... - That they had killed me? No... yes.. I mean... the neighbours said you'd been hurt. - But it wasn't your neighbourhood. How did you find out? - I asked. Why did they shoot you? - Probably mistook me for someone else. We haven't introduced ourselves. I'm Yorgos Pavlidis. Mando Kostopoulou. It's all so peaceful. You think it's no wartime. Even these foreign soldiers... No one can ever forget them. You hate them that much? Let's talk about you. An undergraduate? Yes. And you? Business. If we keep up being friends, I'll talk to you about my business one day. Don't ask me anything now. - Tomorrow? - Tomorrow. How strange a young girl's heart is! Few days before then, all that I loved were my kins, my siblings, my friends. Now, a man I'd only seen twice came and took their place. I lived in waiting for his phonecall. It was absurd but also fascinating. I loved him so much! Yes? At 8. At 8! Agreed. - Were you scared? - Yes. So was I. Mostly for you. I'm used to this more or less. Want to take it off? A drink, eh? Who was this man? Why was he following you? I hope you didn't kill him. No. I only made him realise that he was sort of indiscreet. I wanted us to be alone tonight. Why are you still standing there? - I'm afraid. - Of me? - No. Have a drink. It'll pick you up a bit. I'm afraid for you. Will you find me ridiculous if I tell you I love you? As much as anybody can love on this earth. On another occasion I wouldn't have the right to say that. We would flirt and go out together. I would try to win you before I talked to you of my love. But now, we don't have the time. Our whole life's been condensed into a few hours' time. I love you. Say it again. There's more I'd like to tell you. Suddenly one day next month, or even tomorrow, I may leave. - No... - Yes, my love, leave. And never see you again. At least until the war ends. - But why? There are many things I'd like to tell you. I shouldn't have made you love me. I had no right. I can't keep it from you. I love you so much. I'm in Greece on a special mission. - Are you coming from there? Yes. And I'll leave when I'm ordered to. In a month, in a week, or tomorrow. Would you wait for me? - Yes. You said it yourself. We're living our whole life in an hour. You may leave tomorrow. And I love you so much. I want to be your wife. Tonight. Here. I want you to take the whole me with you. Mado... I know what I'm asking for. That night... I became his wife. - And you never saw him since? - No. You're awake? Why didn't you wake me up, too? I liked watching you sleep. You had the smile of a sleeping baby. How I love you! How I love you! What time is it? Five. It's still night. Yes. We must get going. A cigarette, yes? Mado... Many things may happen to both of us. But nothing will ever be like this night. Anything may happen but they'll never take this night away from us. I didn't believe my life could ever change so suddenly. Till yesterday my life was the war. My mission, the cause. Now I feel as if all these have fallen apart. Only you exist. My love! I don't like loving you like this. I'm angry to be loving you like this. I feel that I could drop everything for you. No, because you would hate me afterwards. Now I hate the war. Do you believe that one night can fill a whole life? I don't believe, I know it. We will get married, Mado. But I am your wife! Time to go. Your family must be worrying. - I care about nothing! But your kins? My kins? I forgot I had any. - Get dressed. - Don't look. It is still night. We must go out before sunrise. I wish there would be no sunrise! The curfew ends at 5, right? I want you to have this always with you. I have so many things from you with me. Go! I don't want you to get involved. - No. If you love me, please go. For God's sakes, go! And you never heard about him again? No. After liberation, when the others returned I asked everybody about him. They didn't know him. There were a few with the name Yorgos Pavlidis but none of them was the man I loved. Seems like Pavlidis was not his real name. Like everybody else, probably he, too, had a pseudonym. I suffered for years. Then I met my husband. You're his friend. And you know better than anyone how perfect he is. He asked me to marry him. I was alone then, after my mother's death. I accepted. Then came the children. I was happy living with him. And now, this man... - You think it's him? - I don't know. I don't know anything. But he looks so like him. And I loved him so much... And now, Eleni, please... I want to be alone. Forgive me, will you? - How is our friend doing? - She's resting. - Want some ouzo? - No, thanks. - He's leaving. - Who is? - The man upsetting our friend. - What nonsense is that? Gourmands are not all idiots, baby. I inquired about him. He's called Depontis, he's a mechanic and lived abroad for years. Now he works around here, in Tripolis, Sparta or so. - All this does not interest me. - It may interest Mado. Listen, Mimis. I thought of you as a good, honest friend. Give up on this nonsense about Mado or I'll change my opinion. Also I won't tell your wife that you broke your diet during her absence. Whom are you looking for, madam? Mr. Depontis. He only just paid his bill and checked out. - Hello? - Is this Mrs. Katelanos? - Yes. - You have a call from Athens. - Hello? - Hello? Who's on the phone? It's you, Doroula? Yes, it's me. Mommy, is that you? Yes, honey. Your mom! How are you, baby? Can you hear me? You hear me well? Yes, I hear you as if you're near me. Is Daddy there? Daddy? No, honey, he'll be back soon. Tell me, how are you? Are you a good girl? Look after your little brother. And don't scold him, all right? Eat your meals, will you? And don't forget to brush your teeth every night, honey. Yes, Mommy. Won't you come back? - I will. - When? I don't know. But I will. Yannakis calls you every day. What shall I tell him? Tell him we'll be back. Alright, honey? Come on, now, we'll get disconnected. Many many kisses to you and our Yannakis. Look after him, eh? You're the lady of the house now. Yes, Mommy. Kiss Daddy for me. Don't forget. No, baby, I won't forget. Bye! Bye-bye! And be a good girl, alright? They're back! Let's go help them carry all that fish! - Has Mr. Depontis left Bourtzi? - Yes, madam. You know where he's going? I heard him say he was moving to Hotel Amphitryon. - So, how did deep-sea fishing go? - A disaster! Good! I'd rather have some veal with aubergines. - Where's Mado? - Upstairs, resting. - Got anything to tell me? - No, why would I? - You're a bad liar. - Go to her. Mado needs you. Dimitris, you forgot your gear. - Did you have a good time? - A great time! - Your headache? - I'm perfectly well. - You missed a fantastic swim! - I can imagine. Never mind, we'll go for a stroll in Nafplio later. Your husband looks lost without you. You'd think these old castles are full of ghosts. Let's go, Mado. They've all gone to bed. Is Mado sleeping? - I think so. Dimitri, Mado's not well. - I don't know the reason, but... - As I said, Eleni, you're a bad liar. The reason... we both know it. You know, then? But it's a folly. Follies are more dangerous. When we got married, you didn't know her yet, Mado told me a few things about this man. She believed he was dead and so did I. But it's preposterous. This man is a dream, a ghost. That's the worst thing about it. Just like you said. A dream. A ghost. A real person you can fight against. They have weaknesses, flaws... But a dream? A ghost? How can you fight it? A dream is more lifelike than life itself. - But Mado didn't... - Don't rush to judgment. Mado has been an excellent wife and mother. Even better, a great friend. Always honest with me. And that's what scares me. She'll be honest once again and I'll lose her. But it's a folly. No one wastes a steady happiness for a shadow. Quite rational. But when did reason rule over our hearts? Mado met this man at a very crucial moment. Too young and during the Occupation, an era when a whole life was condensed into a few hours. Love and death merged into one. And then, the dream remained. "A shadow" you named it? Well, did you consider how much livelier this shadow is than all of us? Did you count the days, the months, the years she's been thinking of him? - But we don't know it's him. - It may not be but the damage is done. He enlivened something in her heart, which she considered to be dead. You sound as if you're ready to give her back. You're missing the point. I could kill this man to keep my wife. But that wouldn't help either. - You must save her. - How? By locking her in the room? Keep her from meeting him? Drag her back to Athens? No, my dear. Even if she retrieved, she'd keep the dream with her. And this would separate us for good. - She must be saved. - Yes, we're obliged to help her. But she must save herself. She must choose by herself. Otherwise, her whole life, as well as mine, would be destroyed. Why don't you go to her? Why leave her alone? This is too much, really! You're letting her choose without trying to interfere. No, Eleni. That's not it. It's something humbler. Fear. I'm afraid to meet her alone. I dread her telling me. I'm a coward. I have no courage to face any kind of resolution with her. I won't stand in her way And when she's gone... I don't know what I may do if I lose her. It's late. We better get some sleep. You go ahead. I'll be up shortly. - Where are you off to? - Nafplio. - But we're starting out for Athens! - Pick me up at the square. Mr. Depontis? Yes? I need to talk to you. My name's Eleni Papadatou. Surely you must find my visit very strange. I'm a close friend of Mado's. Perhaps her only friend. Mado's not well. Something's happened to her. Do you know her husband? No. He's a wonderful person. Mado is happy with him and her children. She shouldn't lose out on this happiness, waste it because of you. It would be a crime. - I agree. You really love her? I don't know what you're talking about. - You are the man from the Occupation? - What if I am? If it is you, just because you loved her so much, you must help her. She's on the edge of the abyss, nobody but you can help her. Go away. - Miss... Women love romancing. It would be quite emotional if I were the man you friend loved. But I'm not. I'm leaving anyway. Not for the reasons you may think but because of my work. Now I can understand why she loved you the way she did. I hope Mado didn't see this. Thank you. Come on, people! We're running late! It's a 4-hour trip to Athens and night will catch up with us. Hey, whatever happened to you? You knew we were about to leave. - Don't make a fuss, I'm ready. - I know, I packed your things for you. - Where's Dimitris? - Buying cigarettes, I think. - I hope you didn't tell him. - No, but I will tell him everything. You crazy? Enough with your foolishness! - I want to see him for the last time. - Too late. He's leaving. - How do you know? You talked to him? - Yes, it's not him. The man you loved is dead. Ever since that morning. I want to meet him. Please, tell me where he is. - Calm down, they're watching us. - Tell me or I'll scream for all to hear. Where is he? - Hotel Amphitryon. You're leaving? I told you you're making a mistake, madam. Your friend was here few minutes ago. She told me all about your story. I'm sorry but it's not me. You're lying. I know it's you. If only you knew how I suffered... It's not me. But even if it was me... If I spent years in military camps and hospitals... only to find you married when I came back... what could ever happen anymore? You have your husband, your children, your life. I wouldn't deserve to be loved if I could so easily destroy all these. But I'm not your man, madam. Forget about both him and me. Happiness is in your hands. Don't waste it. Let's say we never met. If he was alive he'd want the same thing. Have a nice day, madam. (Our children) are waiting. Our house is waiting for us. - I must tell you. - No need, darling. You came... and so you've told me everything. English subs by never4ever (May 2019)
