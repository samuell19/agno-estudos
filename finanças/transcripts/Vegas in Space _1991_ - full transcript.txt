[MUSIC PLAYING] Damn. Another secret mission off to a smooth start. Where to this time, Captain? I hope we meet some far outer space chicks. I'm sick of monsters. You'll enjoy this destination, boys. It's the planet Clitoris, in the Beaver system. Wow. The planet of women. The gal galaxy. But Captain, dudes can't go there. It's a babes-only world. That's one of the earliest prefab pleasure planets. It was put into orbit at the beginning of the last century. But now all those planets are falling to pieces. Why is the Emperess sending us there anyway, Captain? You'll find out all about it from the Empress herself. Attention, attention. Imperial communique. Her royal feminist, Empress of Earth. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hail, Empress. Oh good afternoon, Captain Tracey. I wanted to personally wish you and your brave young space Cadettes all the luck in the universe. What an outfit. It is with grave concern that I dispatch you on yet another dangerous secret mission. Only this morning I received an urgent distress signal from the Empress Nueva Gabor, Clitorian ruler of the glittering resort complex, Vegas in Space. Something terrible is happening there! Something of universal diplomatic and political import. Nueva is our strongest ally in the far-flung Beaver system. Her problem is our problem. But Empress, according to the articles of the Venus Convention, no males are allowed to touch down on Clitoris, even in the direst emergency. That's right, Captain. You and your men will change sex for this undertaking. You will find gender reversal pills in sick bay. Take the pink ones now. And save the blue ones for your return. Change sex? But we only have dude clothes! All necessary gear is already aboard. You will be undercover as traditional mid-twentieth century show girls, sent by me to entertain at Nueva's annual off-world slumber party. Take care of your uniforms. They're government property. Sounds like a cinch. Beware of Veneer, Queen of the Clitorian police. She is my sister. But she is evil. Good luck. And watch out for meteor showers. What do you think, Captain? She looks stunning. Yeah, but what about the mission? Yeah, the mission. Don't worry about the mission, guys. Come on, let's change sex. [MUSIC PLAYING] Steve. Mike. Dick. Uh Captain, you better give me two. I think I need them. I don't know. OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANING] [GRUNTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING AND GASPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANING] He evaporated in the line of duty. [HARPS PLAYING] Hey. We're really foxy chicks! Hot dog. You've got a great set of knockers there, Steve. I mean Stephanie. I hate that name. I'll be Debbie. And you, you can't be Mike anymore. We'll call you Sheila. And I'll just reverse my name. Goodbye, Captain Dan Tracey. Hello, Miss Captain Tracey Daniels. Will there be danger, Captain? Will we be safe? Is life safe, Sheila? When do we get there? Let's ask Jane. Jane babe, what's happening? Two days and seven hours at present velocity of plus five. We got to be there Saturday for the party. Jane, we need speed. I know, let's take an ultra space jump to sector seven. Positions, women. Hit it, Jane. [MUSIC PLAYING] No, not lost in space, drifting aimlessly! Stop it, stop it. We mustn't panic. We'll just have to fly the USS Intercourse manually. Manually? But we're women! Yes. I know, we'll use our feminine intuition. Come on gals, concentrate. Hone in on it. Where is Vegas in Space? Where is Vegas in Space? [HUMMING] There, that way. We did it. We're on course. And we're on time. We'll be there in a couple of hours. Here we go, into the pink vortex, gateway to Vegas in Space! Oh my nails. My hair! Let's go touch ourselves up. [MUSIC PLAYING] Your hair looks so soft now. I love it. You like my hair too, Sheila? Yeah. It's nice and stiff. Sheila, your eyes! Give me a drag. I love your do, Debbie. Jane, you can talk. Well of course. Are we there yet? We'll be over the city any minute. But I've just done my hair. We're going to crash. Hang on. Oh Jane. All right. Oh. Well I think I'm all right. Is my hair still pretty? Yeah. You lost an earring. Welcome to Vegas in Space. I am Princess Angel, Vice Empress of Clitoris. I shall escort you personally to the Empress Nueva Gabor's house. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm so glad you had a safe touch down. Please, follow me. Walk this way. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Shirelle, please see to it that our guest's sleeping quarters are in order. You mean that tacky little rat hole in the basement? Please, allow me to apologize for this rude display. Shirelle, do as I ask. Yes Princess Angel. Follow me, please. [MUSIC PLAYING] Behold, Vegas in Space. An oasis of glamor in a universe of mediocrity. I can think of worse places to spend a vacation. Here comes Empress Nebula's star cruiser now. Really? How can you tell? Observe how she's driving. I'd know that old space bucket of solenoids anywhere. Oh there's that galaxy. Oh she's with that piss yellow Princess Jaundice. Oh, I think they saw me. Hi Noodles. Oh hi honey. Hi, how you doing? Oh now I've got to stop for those two tired queens. If I could just find me a place to park. [WOMEN HUMMING] Oh honey this place is so crowded with that tired tourist trade, you can't even find a place to park. Oh there's a spot right over here. [WOMEN HUMMING] Why you son of a banoozian dog. Honey, oh Martians should not be allowed to drive. Where did you get your driver's license? Plaz World? I'll bet you stole that star cruiser. I'm so glad this is just a stop over. I can't wait to get to off world 68. Civilization, here I come, honey. I'm going to like it here. It's pretty! Mhm. Where do you get your air and light? Girlinium. We live rather well, wouldn't you say so, Odessa? Yes, Princess Angel. Princess, where could I find your sandbox? You will find a personal waste disposal unit in fold lair three. [MUSIC PLAYING] We'll meet your friend in the conversation pit. The Vegas in Space complex is a vast, colorful pleasure palace, ideally suited for the vacationing female. There are 25 plastic beauty bars with skilled glamour technicians, and clothing outlets with styles from every time and space. Grab Noodles. Meet me at the fashion pit in 15 minutes. Shop, shop, shop. You'd think it were her first time on Vegas. Our hostess, Princess Angel, is currently greeting a few of the-- Now tell us something about your world. It's so different. Well Miss Daniels, Vegas is the capital of Clitoris, which is the largest and most luxurious of all pleasure planets of sector seven. Our motto? Glamour first. Glamour last. Glamour always. It's a sleek new world for today's new, improved woman. Oh I'm sorry, we just missed the hologram haven, where one can experience the effects of male stimulation without the danger of actual contact. Oh, I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it with my own two eyes. But what about the economy? What are your principal exports? Cosmetics, mostly. Since the legalization of cosmetic enhancers, our scientists have been working nonstop in order to keep up with demand. Here they are, grade A bootleg beauty boosters. Fresh from Queen-- a friend's personal stash. Unfortunately a black market has sprung up. Now don't go pinning that on no tourists. Those high tech housewives just can't handle glamour like we can. I heard two of them OD'd last week down on Saturn Springs. Oh? Yeah. OD. Now beat it. Thanks to Veneer, our brave police, we are assured that this underground ring is now under control. Mm. Nice. Now arriving from Saturn, Empress Noodles Nebula. Noodles, darling. Welcome to Vegas. Did you have a pleasant flight? Oh, it was hateful. First my oscillator went flat. Then my gyro stabilizer went on the fritz. Everything drifted out of my purse, was going all over the cabin. I didn't know which way was up. Sounds positively nightmarish. So how are things on Saturn since my absence? Oh double drag honey. Ten satellites, and each one more boring than the last. And the summers there? They are the worst. Not once did it get above 200 below. You poor dear. Let's grab your bags and hit the beach. Oh no, honey. No beaches for me. This is merely a stopover. I'm catching the next shuttle for off world 68. Do you mean to tell me your not going to Nueva's tonight? That dog show? Honey, don't make me hurt you. That's a tired scene. Every year Nueva invites every Queen in the universe, and the only people that show up are the same old tired people, in brand new tired outfits. It is a tired scene. Nueva will be so disappointed. She told me herself she was so looking forward to seeing you again. Believe me honey, she'll live. Besides, I want to get a look at those showgirls from Earth. Showgirls from Earth? Why they're right over there. OK? Now you've seen them. So, showgirls from Earth, huh? Yes, yes we are are. Vegas correspondent, National Orbit. So, how's it feel to be finally playing Vegas? Oh we're thrilled to be here. I just love it. Everything is so beautiful. Tracey Daniels and the showgirls from Earth, huh? Tell you the truth, I never heard of ya. Well we've played every resort spot in the outer region. But I guess this is our first big break. And tell your readers we'll do our darndest to give the Empress's guests a show they'll never forget. Good luck. Thanks. A woman's paradise. Vegas, I love you! Oh my goddess, is that Tracey and the showgirls? Oh my goddess it is. Oh Terrace will just die when she finds out she missed this. Miss Daniels? Miss Daniels? Yes? Can I get your autograph? Oh why certainly. What's your name, dear? It's Zorna, Zorna Virga. Oh what a lovely name. You mean you're going to sign it personally? Why certainly. To Zorna, gratefully Tracey Daniels. Oh me too Tracey. We think you're tops. Oh of course. Anything for you dear fans. I wonder where Sheila is. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh not another earthquake. [SCREAMING AND SHOUTING] Oh my goddess. What was that? What was what? The tremor we barely survived. I didn't feel a thing. Oh Sheila, there you are. Are you all right? I don't like this one bit. Enough questions! The Empress is waiting. Please, follow me. I don't like this, Captain. Well keep your head Sheila. Remember, the space boy's counting on us. Attention, shoppers. I said attention, shoppers. Ye Olde Antique on level three has announced reduced prices for the next 60 seconds on its brand new shipment of bean bag chairs. The clock is ticking! Tick, tock, tick, tock. That way, go that way! [MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome to Vegas in Space. I trust you had a pleasant trip. Thank you Princess Angel, that will be all for now. [MUSIC PLAYING] The Empress Vel Crowfoot sends her regrets for not being here herself in person. We ourselves of course are so looking forward to performing a traditional mid-20th century lounge act for you and your guests tonight. How thrilling, an oldie worldie lounge act. It will be a welcome distraction from our present state of scrambled disarray. Our whole way of life is in jeopardy. We're here to help in any way we can. What exactly is your problem, Empress? I don't know. Everything is going awry. Where do I begin? This planet is under a lot of stress, tremors, gas fires, nightmares. No one has had a nightmare here in decades until now. And crime? It's skyrocketing. I myself am a victim of a heinous robbery. My Girlinium gems have been stolen. Gems! All of them? No. I still have the most important pieces. But it is imperative that we recover the others. What is Gorillium? That's Girlinium. Girlinium is a very rare crystal, found only in the caverns of the fourth moon of Girlinia. They have great powers. I use the gems to help our planet maintain its delicate orbit surrounding our sun. Since the robbery our orbit has begun to deteriorate. And seismic disturbances have increased. Quakes. Only tremors so far. Vegas residents and all my intergalactic guests believe it's a special effect for my annual party celebration. Panic must be avoided at all costs. No one must know of your true mission, or of this catastrophe. Did you call the police? Our Queen of police, Veneer, is a prime suspect. She has been involved in many shady dealings throughout the cosmos. [MUSIC PLAYING] Empress. Hail, Queen Veneer. [MUSIC PLAYING] What are these? Listen Queen, I know all about you. You stole the Empress's jewels, didn't you? Maybe I did. And maybe I didn't. Cool your jets. These showgirls from Earth are our royal guests. They will be performing tonight. An animal act. How amusing. So you lost some jewelry, Empress? Some Girlinium, I surmise. Else my dear sister wouldn't have sent these Three Stooges here. You can't get back those gems without my help. As Queen of Clitorian police I have a complete dossier on everyone on this planet. Is the thief still on Clitoris? The thief is still here in my very palace, waiting to steal the remaining Girlinium gems tonight, at my off world slumber party. We'd better act fast. Under the circumstances, I don't have much choice but to trust you. I am willing to ignore my first impression. You do impressions? This is no time for levitation. You're right. Let's be women about it, and work together on this caper. Come on, let's go. Where are we going? We'll take a short cut through the palace. [MUSIC PLAYING] QUEEN VENEER (THROUGH HEADSET): So what did my sister say about me? The same old lies about how evil I am? Look out for that debris. Oh come on, we'll just duck through here. Nice earrings. Thanks. Chromo-sensitive, aren't they? No, they change color. Come on. Hi. Excuse me? Not right now. Can't you see I'm watching another world? We interrupt this program to bring you a special Clitorian intelligence alert. Notorious jewel thief and juvenile delinquent Babs Velour has just escaped from the Farmland Cotton Candy Farm. Hm. Really shocking news. What can I do for you girls? Does this come in my size? You have got to be kidding. Try the parachute pavilion on Lair three. Cheap, poor quality, low class merchandise will be especially on the lookout. And now, future of Velour, K, U, N TV, returning you to Another World. Could you recommend a good gift for a comatose shut in? Have you heard Princess Angel's new record? It's simply cosmic. It's full of such monster dance hits as Hey, Hey Walk This Way and Go-Go With the Flow. No, it's just not quite what I had in mind. All right you little alien, I caught you. Police! Police! come here quick, come on! What is it, Wynetta? Well, well, well, my old friend, Babs Velour. Here's that fugitive that everybody's been talking about. I caught her red-handed, trying to shoplift from this very boutique. Fresh off the farm and up to your old tricks, hey Babs? You can't take me back to that place. I'll do anything you say. Just don't take me back there. I can't take it anymore. Harvesting that gooey cotton candy, day after day. Some nights I couldn't get my fingers unstuck. It's inhumane. Thanks, Wynetta. Glad to help. I won't forget this. Hey, I'll bet she's the one that stole the Empress's jewels. How did you do that? I'll tell you about it later, Tracey. Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh simply stunning. It's so colorful, just like a picture postcard. Yes it is, from here. What do you mean? Well without the color dial turned up it's a different story. [MUSIC PLAYING] What happened? The atmosphere is so thin here it just won't hold the color by itself, so we use the color booster. Can you turn it back up? How's this work? It has something to do with the gyro light refractions. It's very high tech. You know, some planets out here don't even have color yet. And it's only fully operational from here. Geez. So everything is fake here. Yes, the real world is rather colorless. You'll see. Where are you taking me? Oh, to my personal complex. It's on the dark side of the planet. [MUSIC PLAYING] There? In these shoes? Oh, we'll just jump through the nearest transport window. Come on. Come on Tracey. Can't you keep up? I'm trying. Let me tell you, it isn't easy policing paradise. I don't know how you do it. Somebody's got to. Now where is that thing? It should be around here someplace. They keep drifting. Why do you live so far out? Nobody bothers me out here. I mean, can you imagine those palace-bound princesses poking their paws outside the complex, unless somebody tricked them? That's why I keep the color turned down. Yes, I see. [MUSIC PLAYING] Here it is. Is it safe? Is anything? So how did you get into crime fighting? [MUSIC PLAYING] So how did you get into crime fighting? Well when my sister became Empress of Earth, I decided to go into business for myself. But you're the Queen of police. Yes. I can smuggle in anything I want. Contraband? Yes. Like to try one of these? Drugs? Oh, I never. Not drugs. What are they? You know, beauty pills. Oh, I don't know. Look at you. You're a mess. Step into the modern age. I want you to take this beauty booster. When on clitoris. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh thank you. There now. Doesn't that feel much better? I never knew it could be like this. Yes, yes. Anyway, to make a long story short, I built myself this detention center and called myself Queen of police. Nobody said a word. Now I'm very happy. Is there much crime here? Only crimes of fashion, darling. But enough to keep me offended. And busy. Unfortunately there exists a class of incorrigibles who find it impossible to stay within the boundaries of acceptable taste. These are the habitual criminals, who are incarcerated here permanently. Oh I've tried reprogramming and releasing them. But a week later, they're picked up looking like human garbage. Good taste is earned, not learned. See for yourself. I'm afraid to look. It sounds fascinating. Yet repulsive. This one is a very sad case. She was discovered in one of the caverns near Nueva's palace. Some thrill seekers have been tormenting her with atomic blasting caps. I've tried nearly every form of facial reconstruction known to woman to no avail. She's lost the will to heal. [EVIL LAUGHTER] Why do you keep her locked up here? For her own good. This is a sick world, Tracey. Who did it? Isn't that your job? Isn't that why you were sent here? Space Corps finest. Nueva thinks I'm incompetent. Even you think I'm guilty. Oh now cool your jets, Queen. I was just testing you. I mean, I had to be sure. Look, we're in this together. Do you think all these things are connected? Of course they are. I'm convinced only one person is responsible. There have been a lot of strange occurrences after decades of tranquility. Arson, theft, physical torture, it's an awful lot of crime for a planet without men, Miss Daniels. But what about that criminal we picked up in Plaz Grove. I wonder what she has to say about all this. Of course. Little Babs Velour. Let's give her the third degree, shall we? Drag! [MUSIC PLAYING] What is it? She? She is a dragon head. I discovered her one day along the Lavender Coast, scavenging for something to wear. The poor thing was a complete mess at the time. She only had three shoes. I brought her home, prettied her up a bit, and gave her a job here, caring for the prisoners. Where did she come from? What are her origins? I don't know all of the scientific mumbo jumbo. That's Nueva's department. Here, see for yourself. Conceivably Drag's body was frozen solid long, long ago, during the facial age. Then as streams and trim spots one more thawed to the icy atmosphere, Drag's body thawed out. We now know alien sperm, blue blood cells, bone marrow cells, even eyelash adhesive can be brought back to life after freezing. This is a state similar to cryogenic suspension. You make it sound so simple. Can you come up with a better explanation? What I've described to you is Drag's birth, eons ago, in an icy, frozen atmosphere. And now, if you please, her rebirth. You mean women are descended from Drags? That's not so far-fetched. Just take a look in the mirror. Well there you have it. And furthermore, blah. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Doesn't anything function properly around here? Pardon me, Tracey, while I deal with this hopeless excuse for a woman. Drag, the criminal enlarger if you please. [MUSIC PLAYING] Neanderthal! Oh that's right, Babs, lash out at a poor defenseless creature who can't even defend herself. Stop blabbering and take your punishment like a woman. Whoever said you can be Queen of police? I said so, Miss Velour. You've got no right. And that's the way it is. I'm not afraid of you, you fascist fashion plate. In addition to rampant violations of the fashion code, too numerous to mention-- -Liar! I'm innocent. ---you have been found guilty of participating in the heisting of the-- -I wasn't born rich. Neptune gems. Don't I deserve to have nice things, too? To top it all off, you've resisted all attempts at rehabilitation at the Cotton Candy Farm. You can't tell me what to do. You're not my mother. What a capital suggestion. Barry-- What are you doing? You can't! ---Vector, Madeline, Velour. No, not my mother. God, I told her I was at the library. Mrs. Velour? This is Queen Veneer down here on Vegas in Space. We seem to be having a little misunderstanding with your daughter Babs. I think you'd better pop right down here. So you're the Queen. Jeez, you've got a nice place here. Thank you. You're welcome. Kind of looks like a movie set. Welcome to the dark side of the planet, Mrs. Velour. Where have you been? We've been worried sick. Oh I could just die. Oh, somebody find me a crater to crawl into. Mrs. Velour, Babs has been incarcerated at the Cotton Candy Farm. Didn't you know? She's a good girl, Queen! You never tell me a thing. I try. I tell you, I try. But ever since I bought her that souped up star cruiser she's broken every law of gravity. Normally in a case like this you'd really get it. Luckily for you, your mother was home when I called. And so I am remanding you to her custody. No. Oh anything but that. I'm giving you a second chance, Babs. Don't louse it up. I'll see that she doesn't. Things are gonna be different around her. No. Thank you, Queen. I don't care what anybody says, you're a good woman. Oh and Babs, if you're going to steal, you really ought to steal the best. This is definitely not the best. How could you embarrass me like this, in front of the police! Dragging the good name of Velour through the gutter. Ah! Drag. Thank you dear, that will be all. What a spoiled brat. Do you think she's part of the Girlinium connection? What? Do you think she stole the Empress's jewels? No, I'm afraid not. She's too stupid to pull off such a grand scam. Oh, I considered the possibility. But now I'm convinced this is an inside job. Who can it be? I don't know. [MUSIC PLAYING] To tell the truth, I don't know why I even bother. This entire planet is falling to pieces right before my beautiful eyes. And they don't care. Nobody sweeps up after the quakes. The clones are running amok. And the tourists? They come here on vacation and they act like they own the place. And Nueva? She's a child. A little girl playing at being Empress. And Vegas in Space is her toy. Nobody appreciates you, you poor thing. You need a vacation, honey. If only that were possible. But who could take over for me here? Why if I turned my back for one second this entire planet would be reduced to atomic dust. These fools just don't understand that it's our responsibility to show the universe the true role of women in the cosmic order. You're right. Why can't they see that life isn't just an endless parade of pretty dresses, happy hours, and slumber parties? You can't just stumble around waiting for your next glamor booster. I think your planet is lovely. And whoever would spoil such a good time for everyone by snatching the Empress's gems has got to be pretty low. Why if I ever got my hands on her, I'd, I'd, I'd give her a good talking to. I know how you feel, sweetheart. But you mustn't get yourself so worked up. Well if you're not happy, I'm not happy. No, I'm afraid a vacation is out of the question until this case is wrapped up, and the Girlinium is safely hanging around the Empress's green neck. Who are our prime suspects? It must be someone close to the Empress. Someone above suspicion. Someone with a mean streak. Real she-devil. No, an angel. Saint Ann Margret preserve us. We've got to get back to the palace. If I know her, she'll make a play for the rest of those big rocks tonight. Stand back, Tracey. I'm about to change. Thank you, Tracey. I couldn't have done it without you. Now let's get out of here, we've not a moment to waste. [MUSIC PLAYING] Nueva darling, Princess Aggie here. I only have a minute. I can't come to your soiree. Everything is scrambled here. My husband Nicky has stolen all my drag. My bras, my panties, and even my flat suit. Darling it's so horrible. Flutes filled? Check. Mood elevator receptacle ready? Check. How about the ambience control? Ambience control set. Let me see. And the food? I'm going crazy. I can go to Spaceway today. She is substituting Martian lady fingers for the new frog legs. I told you to prepare everything in advance. Now I'm not mad at you. I am mad at the hors d'ouevres. See that Princess Angel is ready. Dismissed. Yes, mom. By the way, if he turns up at the party wearing any of my drag, you just have him killed. I've had enough! [MUSIC PLAYING] Put that down before you blow someone away. Oh my goddess, I almost killed my best friend. What is going on here? I was just sitting there, when all of a sudden Sheila started screaming. And I thought you were that awful Queen Veneer. Well I'm not, so calm down. Sheila, tell me what happened. I was dreaming. Oh it was awful. I've never had a nightmare so vivid, so real. You were there, and you were-- oh it was awful. Calm down. It was just a bad dream sequence. Are you all right now? Yes, I think so. Oh my god. Oh Debbie, how daring! A hot coral babydoll nightie to show off your lovely legs. And Sheila is chic tonight, in this filmly floor-length magenta peignoir. You both look so good it almost takes my breasts away. It's our official government issued lounging gear. Empress Vel thinks of everything. Oh, but we have to get ready for the show now. Oh. Say, what's the dish on Veneer? Oh Debbie she's a stunning Queen. She's really very nice. Huh. And honey, she didn't take those jewels. In fact, she gave me something for you girls. They're beauty pills. I already took mine. Try one Debbie, they're really a trip. Sheila? Now take a beauty pill. That's an order. [MUSIC PLAYING] Stunning. Curious. There now. Isn't that much better? All right, you've had your beauty boosters. Now it's time for a morale booster. Oh no, I mean a little talk. Captain to crew. Man to man. Gal to gal. Chick to chick. You know, us. As you know, we have been sent here on a vital mission. We cannot afford to fail. The safety of the whole universe depends on you, and you. And you too, Captain. Sheila, Queen Veneer will be at the soiree this evening. And I'm counting on you to give her your full cooperation. Okie-doke. She can count on my full copulation too, sir. Now Debbie, we mustn't arouse suspicion. So under the circumstances, well whatever happens, don't stop dancing. That's how you can best save the universe. I have to fix my hair, do my nails, and get ready for the show. We'll rendezvous onstage at the Vanity Lounge. Now remember, we're showgirls from Earth, so we don't miss our queues. All right women, you know what to do. [MUSIC PLAYING] Darling. Sweetheart. Lovely gown. Love you in it. I guess this is another planet, isn't it? How's tricks on Uranus? No, no darling, that's Saturn. Yes. That's a lovely gown. Shame they didn't have it in your size. Thank you. Oh you should see the Vanity Lounge. It's super. I've put in a new antique floor. What's it called? Wood. Wood. [MUSIC PLAYING] Do you see those Go-Go girls from Earth? They're the secret agents. I know. But who told you? Everyone. Doesn't Nueva look lovely? Oh yes. She's good under stress. Oh my, have you ever seen so much glamour in one room? Get those shoes. Got them! Don't buy glamour boosters from Wynetta, honey. The last time I did I got warts. Nine planets in 20 days. Never again. And what about Nueva losing her Girlinium? We've heard do much about you. You look fabulous. Isn't she the sweetest little thing? Yes. Hail Girlina. She thinks she's the hottest thing in the cosmos. I hear she eats cobalt balls for breakfast. Oh my hair's a mess. Do you know where I could find some glamour boosters? Oh I love the way this hormone gas makes my nose tickle. [GLASS BREAKING] It's Queen Veneer. Sorry darling, see you later. [MUSIC PLAYING] My head? Your do has to go. Many thanks. [MUSIC PLAYING] You women are great. How about a pizza pellet. Pellets? Don't you ever have any real food on this plastic planet? It's a crock. They're super. Thank you, Queen. Just between the two-- three of us, we're secret agents. I used to be a man. I have a wiener back home. What's a wiener? More trouble than it's worth. I wish our jobs were important. Sounds like you need a career change, girl. You know, the Space Corps is always looking for a few good women. Why don't you and your friend join up? Oh, could we? Of course! As soon as we crack this caper wide open, you can come back to Earth with us. I think I'll go find Shirelle and have her pack some sensible wigs for the trip. Great. I'll stay here and keep my eyes peeled for suspicious types. Odessa! Odessa! [MUSIC PLAYING] You don't fool around, do you? So much for fun. Now to work. Let's get out of here before I have to arrest everyone in this room. [MUSIC PLAYING] OK, here we are. [MUSIC PLAYING] Go ahead, I'll make sure no one's coming. [MUSIC PLAYING] All clear? Go in, I'm right behind you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Girls, girls, girlinas, may I have your attention? If you will walk this way, the entertainment is about to begin in the Mount Venus Vanity Lounge. [EXCITED EXCLAMATIONS] Plenty of room for everyone. [MUSIC PLAYING] This is the most unexceptional room I've ever seen. You said it. [MUSIC PLAYING] Those gems have got to be around here some place. You check that storage module. But be careful, it's wet over there. I'll look for secret compartments. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hurry up. We can't afford to be discovered. Did you hear about those jewels? Those were the smallest jewels I've ever seen. How disappointing. [OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS] I had to speak to the Empress herself. Does anyone know anything about this act? Queens. Queens, Empress's, and Girlinas. The Mount Venus Vanity Lounge is proud to present a woman whose tastes-- talents knows of no bounds. Direct to you from Earth, Miss Tracey Daniels. [APPLAUSE] Who is this Tracey Daniels anyway? [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh the poor dear. Does she know she looks like that? Don't they have mirrors on Earth? Oh thank you, thank you. You're really beautiful. And I'm so happy to be here tonight. Tonight we are presenting for you a traditional mid-20th century lounge act. I hope you'll enjoy it. This act really is an antique. I know for me, tonight will be the most memorable night of my shirtless career. [MUSIC PLAYING] Pipe down you fool you want to spring us? [MUSIC PLAYING] Are you mad? Do you want every Queen and Princess at the slumber party to know we're in here? My face. It's, it's alive. Nonsense. It's just a standard beauty mask. Everyone wears them here. Now stop being silly and get busy. They're here. I know it. [MUSIC PLAYING] There's nothing over there. Did you find anything? [WHIMPERING] That Princess Angel thinks she's so clever. And now it's traditional to tell a joke. Here's one I wrote on my trip across the cosmos. How many space queens does it take to screw in a light bulb? Non. This is the 23rd century. Nobody screws light bulbs anymore. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] My Girlinium detector reads negative. She must have those gems on her person. That's my spot! I'm supposed to be on stage. Showgirls from Earth. (SINGING) By the time I jet to Venus, the sun's rising. I'll read the news, all the headlines in the dawn. They crashed. We're torn apart. They say I'm dreaming of a sweet place. Oh send me back in outer space. Oh well, I've got to fly away once again. So don't you cry, don't you worry, yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right you, hand them over. What were you doing in my room? You heard what I said. Your little game is up. It's over. You've been spring. I don't know what you're talking about, you silly old Queen. Besides, what would I want with your stinky old gems? Don't play dumb with me, Angel. I want you to give me back the Girlinium. I don't have them. And you're not getting them back. Angel. No, they're mine. And you can't have them. Come back here. Angel! Leave me alone! Come back here. I said come back here! [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Don't you cry. Don't you worry. Honey please won't you tell me where you're from? (SINGING) Me, I'm from Metal. Me, hail from Metal. I'm tired. And want to go away, away from here. [MUSIC PLAYING] Why do you always have to ruin it when I'm having a good time? Just leave me alone! Stop this nonsense or I'll have you shipped off to the Cotton Candy Farm. You wouldn't like that, would you? No, no! [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] [GASPS OF HORROR] What a smell. It stinks in here. Oh no, you've broken my Princess Angel doll! [OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Your Girlinium. The planet is saved. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] So Princess Angel was fake. I should have known. Hm. [OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Darling, you're a sweetheart take over for me here. Are you sure you don't mind? Don't worry about a thing but your skin. The weather should be perfect on the planet Mexico. Make this a real vacation. I'll hold down the fortress. Thank you, Tracey. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh. My sister's turning on. Hail, Vel. Hail, Sister. Have fun in Mexico. I understand you can drink the water now. And congratulations, Colonel Tracey Daniels. I'm granting your request for a transfer effective immediately. I'm sure you will find your new duties as acting Queen of Clitorian police, and my personal Ambassadoress, a relaxing and rewarding tour of service. And congratulations to my brave young Space Cadettes, Captain Debbie Bane, and Major Sheila Shadows. And welcome aboard, Privates Odessa and Shirelle. Hey! All right. I never thought we'd be going to Earth. What are we waiting for? Let's go. When you return, I will personally brief you on your new mission. Good luck, women. Hail, Empress. Signing off. But what about me? (IN UNISON) Oh Jane. [LAUGHTER] Now let me get this straight, no rollers in public. No flat shoes. And shoot on sight anyone wearing beige. It's been swell working undercover with you. You'll have a ball sneaking around the cosmos, poking your nose into everyone's business. Well, ciao, darlings. What a woman.
