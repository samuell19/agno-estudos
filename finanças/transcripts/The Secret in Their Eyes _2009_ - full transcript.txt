On June 21st, 197 4, Ricardo Morales had breakfast with Liliana Colotto for the last time. For the rest of his life he'd rememberevery single detail of that morning. Planning their first vacation, drinking tea with lemon, for his nagging cough, with his usual lump and a half of sugar. The fresh berry jam he'd never taste again. The flowers on her nightgown, and specially her smile. That smile like the sunrise blending in with the sunlight on her left cheek... No, no, no! Please, don't! ''l FEAR'' The gates of Heaven have opened, and an angel got out. - Esposito... - Bye, baby. Look what the cat dragged in. How are you, Counselor? And you, Lieutenant? ls the boss here? Go right in, Your Honor. Thanks, Reverend. You look good and rested. What a fucking asshole! Takes one to know one. The gates of Heaven have opened... Your Highness. What a surprise! - May l? - What brings you here? Just wanted to chat. You busy? Jut overpreparing for a hearing. Coffee? l'm asking just in case retirement made you healthy. Mariano! Yes, Your Honor. Bring us two of those great coffees from the cafe. l'm typing a deposition. A deposition? Meet Mr. Benjamin Esposito, our recently retired royal honoris causa, and an old friend. Mariano, our spring-summer intern. Not bad, huh? Here, bring some petit-fours and get yourself a candy bar. l'll take extra cream. That's right, you're not well. What was your problem again? Old age? Extra cream for the man, he has an age problem. Yes, ma'am. Wait. ls it important? No. Leave the door open, son. Come on, sit down. What do you know about writing novels? l've been writing all my life. Take a look in the archive. Oh, the case files. How many pages will your file be? Does it have a cover? A little encouragement would be nice. What should l do? Act like some unwanted retiree who wants to help out? Serve coffee? l want to write, so what? l want to write about the Morales case. l don't know why, it's been on my mind. We actually never talked about it. Why was that? With your handwriting, it'll be unreadable. Wait, look. My biggest problem is that l've started fifty times and never got past the 5th line. At this rate, l'll spend my whole pension fund on spiral notebooks. Come here, give me a hand. Here, let me. l can't... lt weighs a ton. l can't believe it. The old Olivetti. lt was in storage. l think it's 100 years old. Think they fixed the ''A''? The ''A'' is for pansies. Take it. Dinosaurs have to stick together. Now l'm out of excuses. l'll have to write. But where do l start? Wherever you remember the most. lt was over 20 years ago. Which part comes back most often? That's the image you should start with. lt's a start. lThis is your new boss, fresh out of Harvard.l lMiss lrene Menendez Hastings.l ''Hastings'' lt's pronounced ''Hastings.'' lt's scottish. Sorry. Hastings, the new clerk. Your deputy, Benjamin Esposito. Actually l went to Cornell, not Harvard. Pablo Sandoval, deputy clerk, your humblest servant. Hey! Are you here? Yes, it's just that... l remember plenty of beginnings, but l'm not sure they have to do with the story. Then start at the beginning and stop dwelling on it. Blood Bank, good morning. Mr. Esposito... The 25th called. A homicide. Court 18. lt's their turn. They said it's rape and murder. Court 18. Good morning. Hi, fellas. Good morning. Ma'am, did a saint die this morning? Why? Because an angel in mourning just walked in the door. Ah, no. lt's just a trick we angels have to look 5 pounds lighter. Can you bring in the Chavez file? Of course. You smooth fucker. Why? Why? You have a compliment ready the moment she walks in the door. How do you do it? Well, l may dress like a toad, but l'm actually Prince Charming. - Mr. Esposito! - What?! Counselor Romano... He told them it was our turn. Counselor Romano? Tell him Sheriff Esposito is gonna fuck him up. - Okay - Come back here. Three hours thinking of what to say, she opens the door and... l freeze up. lt's easier for me, l'm not in love. Neither am l, moron. Go on. l want you to get the files and put them on this side. All together, it's simple enough. Romano, what did you tell the Precinct? lt's your turn. We're alternating. We got another case, what's the problem? A mini-mart robbery, smart-ass. Alternating similar cases. What do you want me to do? Ask Judge Fortuna. l want a solution, not two problems. Why is asking me a problem? lt's not that. lt's just silly to bother you with something trivial like this, if we can handle it ourselves. Strictly speaking, it's your turn. And hurry up, or you'll find a wake instead of a crime scene. What's up, Baez? Still here. And you? Tired of being happy. You look happy. As a dog with two tails. l just love it when that moron sends me to see a dead girl Come on in. Morons are a dime a dozen. Quiet, easy-going ones who know they're morons. Live and let live. They're useless but harmless. They don't bother. - How are you, lnspector? - Talking about you. Then there are morons who think they're geniuses. They shit everywhere and someone has to wipe their asses. Of those morons l know not one, but two. The judge and my buddy at Court 18, who's either a moron, a son of a bitch, or both. lt was his turn, so l'm asking you to tell the Judge. Tell him l have nothing to do with... Liliana Colotto, 23 years old, teacher, Recently married to Ricardo Morales, bank clerk. The old lady mentioned two builders working on the terrace in number 3, but they haven't shown up in 2 days because of the rain. Sure she didn't see them? She says no. l'll go see the husband. See you, Esposito. l'll go with you. Good afternoon, Ricardo Morales? That way. - Ricardo Morales? - Yes, that's me. lnspector Baez, Federal Police. Anyone else have a key to your home? See any strangers around the last few days? The neighbor said you came home every day at lunchtime. Out of the way, isn't it? Any reason in particular? Sorry, l didn't get that. We had a habit, a routine. We liked watching The Three Stooges together. She thought they were funny. You'll have to come with me to the morgue. We'll do the best we can, l know it's unpleasant. What is wrong with this typewriter? Could you please get rid of it? l can't take it anymore. - Who will want it? - l don't know. Just get it out of my sight. Okay, Benja, see if you like this. With this statement, l, Criminal JudgeRaimundo Fortuna Lacalle, hereby declare myselfcompletely insane and incapable... That's wrong. Give it here. lt goes like this: Pursuant to articles 1 41, 1 42 and 1 43 of the Civil Code, MY RULlNG -in capital letters- is that Raimundo Fortuna Lacalle, is mentally ill,legally-speaking, insane, suffering from chronic delirium and is therefore unable to carry out his functions as a civil servant.'' How are things, Miss? Plenty of signatures? Yes. We have the Nicolosi case. No big deal, Your Honor. Witness statements, nothing more. Very good. Sorry, there's one file left,Your Honor. Thank you. Hello, Your Honor. - How are you? - Fine, you? - Benjamin, Pablo... Ma'am. - Hello. Hey, Benjamin... just to show you Court 18is acting in good faith, remember you were upset the other day over getting a case? Well, the case has been solved. Two builders working in number 3. They're under arrest in the 25th. Whenever you have a chance, you can bring them in to question them. Hold on... What builders? Their names are... Jacinto Caceres, Bolivian, 35 years old. Juan Robles, 34. At least he's Argentinean. l'm blown away, Romano. Keep this up and l'll give Court 18all the hard cases. Bad news for you, son. Please, sir. Always happy to help out. Esposito, how are you? Romano warned you l was coming? l was already typing the report. You'll get the guys tomorrow: it's them, they signed a confession. Monday at the latest. Let me in. Sergeant Sicora has to authorize it. Sicora is about to eata plate full of shit. really, You wanna go join him? Go right ahead. Two for the price of one. Well? Are you Caceres? No, l'm Robles, he's Caceres. Caceres, lt's okay. You stupid son of a bitch! Are you fucking sick or what? You arrested two nobodies!Nobodies! They weren't even there! Let them go, what do l care? You ordered it beat the hell out of them! Know where l'm going? To file a complaint! We'll see who saves your ass this time! Fuck your complaint! Don't worry, you're going to. Go file it. All this fuss over two lousy blacks! Your eyes will be black when l'm done with them! Knock it off! You better check the wanted ads. You'll never set foot here again! You don't know who you're fucking with! You have no idea. Benjamin... lt's okay, l'm going to file a complaint.l'll be right back. Fine by me. Don't worry, l'll be right back. - Did you see Sandoval? - He left. - Where? - Down Talcahuano. This country is upside down. You're upside down. How can you defendthisdemagoguepresident of ours? Watch what you say,you'll get into trouble. Attention, everybody, please. Chief Justice Benjamin Espositojust walked in the door. Hail, Your Honor. Oh come on... How much does he owe? Nothing, nothing at all, l pay for my own drinks, you know that. Besides, it's early. What's the big deal? l'll pay for it, here l go. That's it. No no, l have money... lt's paid. Fine. ln that case, Mr. Esposito can buy everybody a round... No no... Thanks! Hands off, hands off, you're not the boss in here, don't embarrass me in front of my friends, got it? l'll never spot you money again. Why do you keep screwing around? Okay, okay, let's go.Slowly, everything's fine. lt's fine. We're leaving. Come on. l'm going... well, see you. Here we go. Goodbye! My jacket. l've got it. See you, Emilio. Bye... Why don't you two speak? You're his wife and this is his home.. You bring him at this hour,l don't know where he's been... You bring him now, l don't know what to do. lt's early, you should thank me. Mine? You brought him like this. You mean it's my fault? Who is it? Benjamin Esp√≥sito. Who? From the courts, remember? Pretty, wasn't she? Very. l really am sorry for those guys. They should be getting out by now. habia que esperar a que They had to be checked by forensics for that lawsuit l mentioned. No, keep looking. That way you'll get to know her better. Here's another album. l look at her picturesall day long l know l'm in denial, but... it helps me go onuntil we find the guy. That's when she graduated. Then she came from Chivilcoyand moved in with her aunt. She worked in a school in Almagro, that's how we met. She used to pay her billsat the bank. l still don't know where l gotthe courage to talk to her. Tell me one thing. When we get this guy, what will he get? Rape and homicide.He'll get life. We don't have the death penalty. l don't agree with the death penalty. Me neither. l thought maybe for you it could serve as retribution. Retribution? Will they rape himand beat him to death? No, they'll give him an injectionand he'll take a nap. lt's not fair. l'd gladly trade places with him. Those are from whenshe was 1 7 or 18. That's the spring picnic in Chivilcoy. Ever been there? No. l have, she took me to visit her folks. Let him grow old. Live a life full of nothing. What is it? Nothing... Did she have any brothers? No, why? Do you know who this is? He's in several. Looking at her. l showed Liliana this system, otherwise, years pass and you forget who's in the photo. True... Laporta, Rodriguez, Cardozo, Simone... Here it is. Gomez, lsidoro Gomez. Well? l always thought the photo thing was a bit crazy. Yeah, but l think... it's the look in their eyes. That's the key. You see this kid looking at this woman... Worshipping her. The eyes... Speak... They bullshit too, they should keep quiet. Sometimes it's better not to look. What? We never talked about this case. When did you come back from Jujuy? ln '85. Why now? Better than planting begonias... Why? Because l've been sidetrackedfor over 20 years. Courts, cases, friends, pranks, A marriage, several affairs... l got sidetracked. And now that l'm retired, nothing sidetracks me. l was in a bar the other night and l saw myself having dinner alone...and l didn't like myself. l know it doesn't happen to you. l'm not asking you to understand. And in trying to... find the reasons,the moments... Everything leads me Morales. lt's as if my life had... Answer it. lt's Alfonso, l'll call him back. Answer it, l'll wait. l'll call him back. lt's no problem, answer it. l'm finishing up here,l'll be right there. Start without me,l'll be right there. lHi?l Good evening.Does lsidoro Gomez live there? Yes... - ls he home? - No, he doesn't live here anymore√° No? No, he moved away, to Buenos Aires. Ah... Buenos Aires? Who's calling? l'm calling on behalf of Councilman Mendez, it's for a job. Has he been in Buenos Aires long? A month, a little longer. Do you know where l can find him?Have you got an address? This job is pretty urgent. He's working on a construction site. On a site? Yes, he said it was... Montevideo, near Lanoes... l don't remember very well, but... What type of job is it? lt's a job that will interest him. lt's for Councilman Mendez and... Tell me something. Yes... Were he and Liliana Colotto friends? They used to see each other.She's from here. Why? She works for the councilman. She's the one who recommended himfor the job. She did, did she? He'll be glad to hear that. Really? Do you thinkhe'll remember her? Oh, yes√â He really liked that girl. But then she moved away... To Buenos Aires, and they never saw each other again, l think. Hello... Hello? Hello! lf he's here, it's a miracle. Schmuck. Poor guy. lmagine losing the love of your life. Not him, you. lf you'd kept your mouth shut and called me first without saying anything. Morning, we're looking for lsidoro Gomez. What is it? Who are you? Mike Hammer, asshole. Did he come to work? No he didn't. We know nothing about him. Give me his address. Right away. Fernandez! Fernandez! We know Gomez got a phone calllast night. He went in the bedroomand came out 10 minutes later with his coat and suitcase packed. The foreman says they owed hima week's pay but that he left without any fuss. l can ask around if you want,lnspector. l saw the same photographs you did.l should have picked him out. Forget it, Esposito.That case is nothing but hot air. lf you think l'll do all that paperworkto issue a request in Chivilcoy to search some old lady's house to find letters the son may or may not have sent and yadda, yadda, yadda...Please, Esposito. You're nuts. We have nowhere else to look, sir. Your little game of Don Quixotewith Romano was enough. Poor guy got transferred to bumfuck, lowa. Or maybe he's in Chivilcoy,try asking him. Anyway... the general saidwhat he had to. Oh well... l don't know what to do. Morales is getting worse every day, the murderer knows we're after him, my judge is a moron, l want to kill lrene, and the only guy l can trustin this world is a drunk, a total fucking imbecile. l have an advantage.A small one, but an advantage. Today's the 28th, right? The drunk idiot hasn't got paid yet. Last month's he already drank. So when it's time to pay the bill,he'll have a dilemma. Either he says he's broke,gets arrested, beat up, goes home a mess and his wifekicks him out for good, or he turns to his boss the chump,who happens to be me, and asks him to pay. But one thing. Since his bossis a chump, but not a complete chump, he'll pay one last time. But in exchange for a favor.And the drunk idiot can't say no.lsn't that right? l gotta pee. Hold on. The old lady has to come out at some point. Too much Napoleon Solo and Perry Mason.That's your problem. l'm serious, l gotta take a leak. Son of a bitch!Damn you! Damn you! You scared the fucking crapout of me! l scared you?What are you doing here? l came to help you. You're supposed to keep watch outside. lf she comes back, we're screwed. She ain't coming back. How do you know? She's in the grocery store,she'll be a while. Calm down, for God's sake. Did you find anything? The letters... Huh? The letters, but no... Come here... There's no address. This one's from the other day. So? lt's recent! The trash. The envelopesmay still be in the trash. So! No, nothing here! Nothing at all? Nothing. Did you go through it? Wanna try? Knock it off! Go on!.... What is it? Come here! Calm down, l'll let you out. Easy! Want me to drive? The dog probably had rabies,you're gonna die. Why didn't you keep watch? lf she finds out we broke in... Benjamin, as soon aswe came for the letters, sooner or later she'd realize. That's why we didn't take the letters. You weren't stupid enoughto bring them, were you? Ah... And what if l did? What if? What if? lf she finds out, she'll tell Gomez and the guy will disappear for good. Don't you see? No. You don't? You're fucking blind! Because you... You'll see, when l figure it out... The whole thing about the date... l'd much rather work alone! Tactical Revolutionary Command,may l help you? Wrong number.That's quite all right. Nothing at all? Or l'm missing something. lt's like the guy knewwe were going to read the letters. lt's just names.Bullshit, nothing concrete. ''Don't worry about me.l'm like Manfredini, not Bavastro.''People from Chivilcoy. Here, let me see.Oh, shit... Sperm Bank, loan department.Good morning... We borrow sperm. Deposit or withdrawal? Esposito!, Sandoval! Wrong number... Sandoval! Judge Fortuna wants to see you. You hear my voice when l speak to you,don't you, Esposito? Yes, sir. Then l have to assumethat if l tell you something and you do exactly the opposite, it's not that you didn't hear me but that you could give a flying fuckabout the order l gave you. lsn't that right, Esposito? Not quite like that, sir. And if my colleague from Chivilcoycalls me very angry to tell me that two of my employees broke into some poor old lady's house, that means what l say isn't wortha bucket of shit. l don't know where your colleaguecould have heard such a thing. That's exactly what l told him,Esposito. However, my colleague tells me that the other day in Chivilcoy at the intersection of Franciso Saveyand the corner of Schiaffino in the city limits of Chivilcoy a black Peugeot was parked with aBuenos Aires license plate number 133-809, and my colleague asks the Federal Policeto run a background check on the vehicle. Guess whose name the car is registered to? Tell me, who? A certain... Espo... Esposi! To. And the Federal Policetell him where he works. And the judge calls meto see if l can clear things up. And the truth is, Esposito, l can't.Because l don't look like a judge anymore, l look like afirst class fucking idiot. Because l say l want Aand l people give me z. Just like this piece of shittypewriter they gave me! Excuse me, sir, but... l think something weirdis going on here. Exactly. Wait, wait. Wait a minute.You ain't heard nothing yet. After you can go right backto treating me like a fucking idiot. But listen to this. Because what stood out mostin that little town wasn't the two guysfrom Buenos Aires, no. Or that one of them was seen tYIng his shoelaceswhen he was wearing loafers. What stood out most was that one of themwalked into the grocery store, greeted them pleasantly, asked for a bottle of whisky and left drinking straight from the bottle. Shall l describe him for you? We have to deny it, Benjamin.''lt wasn't me, l don't know...'' Don't ever talk to me again. Never again. Deny everything. Ma'am, honestly... Get out of my sight. Are you against us too? lrene, l'm talking to you! lrene! Not only was it a stupid move, but you did it behind my back. l didn't think you'd be... You think l'm here to joke around. l didn't say that. You didn't need to. l can tell. Let's get this straight. l'm the boss and you're the employee. Twelve letters.31 pages on thin paper. He mentions 5 jobs,two as a builder, one delivering groceries,two without details. Three neighborhoods in Buenos Aires:Monte Grande, San Justo and Avellaneda. Six names: Anido, Mesias, Oleniak, Manfredini, Bavastro y Sanchez. Only one reference to a woman:Rosa, apparently an aunt. That's it. That's all l've got.The rest is nothing. Benjamin! This is nothing too? Please... Leave it open, it isn't private. l talked to Fortuna. l explained that you're an imbecile. l used my irresistible smile and convinced him to call the judge in Chivilcoy and forget the whole thing. l don't know how to thank you. l ask that you refrain from such actions in the future. You're free to go. One question, if l may. Which irresistible smile? l don't think l've seen it. Of course not. l save it for my boyfriend, as l should. Of course. Right. l won't take any more of your time. And bring me the Liliana Colotto file, to seal it and archive it. The case is closed. Getting engaged. Kids today laugh at it. Who gets engaged anymore? And this kid? What was his name? He was here less than a year... Godoy. Godoy! -Larreta got him the job. -That's right. Yes... Silly me, l didn't put a date on the photo. When was it? Two or three months after Chivilcoy. A week later. l remember perfectly. A week after we fought you showed up with Alfonso whatever his name was to announce your engagement. Look at Sandoval, trYIng to look sober. lt's so weird, l don't recognize myself. l look like someone else. Who were you? What were you like? l don't know. Straight, conservative... Stuck-up. Structured. lnflexible. Young. Young, Benjamin. l was young. You were young, too. Look, no gray hair. And here, looking to the side, all serious. l was another person. Your novel might be really good. But it's not for me. You've reached the end of your life and you want to look back. But l can't. l have to go to work every day. And live with this. lt may not be ''The'' Justice, but it's ''some'' justice. And at the end of the day l have to go home and live with my husband... and with my children, who l adore. My whole life l've looked forward. ''Backwards'' is out of my jurisdiction. l declare myself incompetent. What a case, Jesus Christ. lt never dies. Morales! Morales! Hello! How are you? - How are you? - Esp√≥sito Of course. How are you? Fine, and you? Here l am. Would you like to sit? Yes... How are things? This month l'm here Tuesdays and Thursdays. What? ln this station. The other days of the week l wait in the other stations. l change it every month. He'll have to come through eventually. He must live out of town, he knows in the city he'd be caught. lt's been a year but l imagine you haven't stopped investigating. - right? - No, no... You must think l'm crazy. No. Don't worry about me, please. No, l won't. The worst part is l'm starting to forget. l have to constantly make myself remember her. Every day. The day she was killed, Liliana made me tea with lemon. l'd been coughing all night and she said it would help. l remember those stupid things. Can you see? Then l start having doubts and l don't remember if it was lemon or honey in the tea. And l don't know if it's a memory or a memory of a memory l'm left with. Excuse me. l need to talk to you. Come in. Thank you. Something happened to me yesterday. l was up all night thinking about it. l thought about you... Have you ever... have you ever seen things from a different angle? You see someone else and what the other person is going through helps you see your own life. Go on. Yes. And l thought, ''l have to talk to lrene.'' You might get pissed at me... Sorry. You might want to kill me, but... l have to give it a try. Wait a moment while l close the door. Sandoval, l'm busy. l'll call you when l'm done. Benjamin asked me to come. Yes, l was hoping the three of us could talk. Excuse me, ma'am. l ran into Morales yesterday at the train station... Doing what? My crystal ball is broken. He goes to the terminals every day looking for the killer. Every single day after working at the bank. You can't imagine his love. lt's touching. lt's as if his wife's death just left him there, stopped, stuck in time forever. You should see his eyes. They're in a state of pure love. Can you imagine a love like that? Unaffected by the wear and tear of the routine? Speak for yourself, it doesn't affect mine. We think the guy deserves another chance, ma'am. Where do l come in? The case is closed. We'd have to reopen it. You're asking me to destroy an official document, with mine and the judge's signature on it... and to falsify statements and dates so it will look like the case is still open? That's a brilliant idea. We hadn't... Don't fuck with me. Everything okay, sir? No. Sandoval? He left down Talcahuano. Not only do you sneak off to get drunk, you also steal evidence. Everything's under control. lf lrene reads the file... Hands off. Are you nuts? We're going back. Sit down for a second. Sit down and take it easy. Know why we can't find him, Benjamin? Because we're stupid. Look: ''Twelve letters. 31 pages. Five jobs...'' l already read this part. Can we go? Hold on a second. My mind exploded, l couldn't stop. l kept asking myself, ''Why can't we find this guy?'' He always vanishes. Where is he? And l started thinking about guys. Guys in general. Not just this guy, but... Guys in general. ''The'' guy. The guy can do anything to be different. But there's one thing he can't change. Not him, not you, not anybody. Take me, for example. l'm young, l have a good job, a wife who loves me... And like you always say, l keep throwing my life away in dives like this. Many times you've asked, ''Why are you here, Pablo?'' ''Why?'' You know why, Benjamin? Because it's my passion. l love coming here, getting drunk, slugging it out with anyone who pisses me off... l love it. Just like you, Benjamin. There's nothing you can do to get lrene out of your head. She's dYIng to marry someone else, her desk drawer is full of wedding dress magazines. She got engaged, had a party, everything. But you keep waiting for the miracle, Benjamin. Why? Come here. How's it going, notary? How are you? How are you? This is that friend l mentioned, Esposito. Andretta the notary. A real notary, and my tech advisor. Here's my card. Let's begin with the first letter from our friend Gomez. lt's okay, keep it. ''l swear it rained so hard l looked worse than Oleniak that night.'' Notary, please. Juan Carlos Oleniak. First played for Racing Academy in '60. ln '62 he went to Argentinos Juniors, and back to Racing in '63. ln a classic match with San Lorenzo, he got pushed and fell face-first into the ditch. He was soaked. We call him Plato. The Academy is his life. ''l'll send for you. We make a great team. Anido by himself isn't the same as Anido with Mesias.'' Anido and Mesias, backs on the club that won it all in '61 . Negri at goalie, Anido and Mesias. Blanco, Peano and Sacchi. Corbatta, Pizzuti, Mansilla, Sosa and Bel√©n. ''Don't worry about me. l'm like Manfredini, not Bavastro.'' Notary? Pedro Waldemar Manfredini. Racing paid peanuts for him and he ended up being an extraordinary player. lncredible. Julio Bavastro, right forward. Played only two matches between '62 and '63 without scoring. Quote: ''l don't want to end up like Sanchez.'' Who's he talking about? He can only mean the goalie, Ataulfo Sanchez. Eternal benchwarmer. He played only 1 7 matches between '57 and '61 . Notary, what is Racing to you? A passion. Even after 9 years without a championship? A passion is a passion. You see, Benjamin? A guy can change anything. His face, his home, his family, his girlfriend, his religion, his God. But there's one thing he can't change. He can't change his passion. lt's a beautiful night for soccer./ lHurac√°n hosts Avellaneda's Racing Club at Tomas Duco Stadiuml lon a splendid night for soccer.l lRacing has slipped in the standingsl land can't waste this final opportunityl lto stay in the race for the championship.l lJorge has the ball.

What police? Quit fucking around. Pablo! Police, stop! Stay there, don't jump! Where is he going? Sorry. How's it going? l'm waiting for Sandoval. What for? l play the nice guy, then he comes in... l'll explain later, it's a routine we have. Oldest trick in the book. You can't question him without the judge. Of course we do! Actually, we have to pull it off before he gets here. Questioning a prisoner with no lawyer or judge? Ordo√±ez! You seen Sandoval? He left a while ago. Damn it! lt won't stand up. What will you charge him with? What do you mean? You think it's little to go on? Looking at the victim in a photo? Yes, it is. That's why we have to soften him up. What if it's not him? Don't look at me like that. Eduardo! -What if it's not him? -Of course it is. Yes, Counselor? Don't call me that. Go get Sandoval. Should l take a taxi? Yes. iNo! No, no... He goes to Robertino's in the morning. in Viamonte, hurry! No. Wait, Eduardo. Wait, wait! What are you doing? l'm sorry, l'm sorry! lt's him. How do you know? l don't know. -See? -l don't know how l know, but l know. How? Gomez, lsidoro N√©stor. l.D. Number. 10,7 40,925. -Marital status? -Single. Address. Mocoret√° 2428, lsidro Casanova. What train do you take into town? What train do you take into town? l don't take the train. l take the bus. What's the problem? Mo, core... ah,... This typewriter is no good! The ''A'' doesn't work. Wait, hold on. What is this about? Please, l beg you. You're implicated in the Liliana Colotto case, rape and homicide. lt happened on June 21st, 197 4. Actually, you're the accused. l'm going to take your statement. You'll be assigned a public defender. Wait, wait. Liliana Colotto? l knew her back in Chivilcoy. What happened to her? Tell me, G√≥mez, Why do you think you've spent 3 days behind bars? l have no idea. l was at the match... Yeah, and you took off running. What would you do? Two crazy-looking guys suddenly jump you... What happened to Liliana? Look, Gomez, don't... You know as well as l do you raped and killed her. Liliana... Are you serious? l would never do that. l haven't set foot in Chivilcoy in over a year, l can prove it. We looked for you a week after the homicide and you disappeared, from a hostal and a job. What hostal? l never left any hostal. Gomez, don't play dumb. The hostal on Piedras. That was a year ago! l left because l couldn't afford it. And your job? l found one that paid better. What's that got to do with Liliana? l've known her my whole life, she's a friend from my childhood. They can't find Sandoval. What? They can't find Sandoval. Okay, let me think... Listen. Fortuna should be here any minute. Please, wait for him... Please... Huh, yeah... You could... Maybe... You could be right. lt might be preferable, more practical... Let me see, one second. Look, Gomez. The judge handling your case will be here soon, so we'll wait. Ma'am? Sorry to interrupt, deputy, l mean, Counselor. l know you're handling this case. But this kid couldn't have done it. We'll talk outside. Wait, just a minute. Look at him. This kid couldn't have done it. Let me see the autopsy. The Colotto girl... Here she is. 5 feet 6, 128 pounds. Look what he did to her. l'm sorry, Gomez. But l don't buy it. The Amazon and the Pigmy? Besides, she was a beautiful woman. Please, look at this face. A beauty like her isn't within just anyone's reach. lt takes a real man to hook a woman like that. You think so? l mean... The door wasn't forced. That means she knew her assailant. Yes. But there's no way such a woman would ever remember this twinkie! Unless she was a hooker. Some guys you only do for money. Who is she? Keep your fucking mouth shut. No, she was a decent girl, l assure you. l agree with the kid about that. She was two-timing that bank clerk for sure. l'll bet his horns were so big he needed a convertible. What are you laughing at, retard? That guy who gave testimony last time. Sandoval? Right. l bet it was him. He was her lover. Tall, good-looking, broad shoulders. A man truly capable of warming up a woman. Look at this pussy. l'll bet when she saw him she thought, ''Oh, no, it's that schmuck who always makes mushy faces in all the photos.'' lsn't that right? Yes or no? That's how l wanted you motherfucker! Get him out of here! l caught you motherfucker! Get him out, please! You people are crazy. Listen, Benjamin. ''The damage to the right parietal bone demonstrates the assailant had extraordinary upper body strength.'' Look, two noodles. ''Likewise, due to the depth of her vaginal injuries, we may deduce that the assailant was very well-endowed.'' Obviously they're not talking about this microbe. He must have a peanut. There it is, bitch. How do you like it? Sweetheart, you'll never reach the pi√±ata. First, you're too short. Second, you're not man enough for a real woman like me. Not man enough? Fucking bitch! l fucked the shit out of her! l fucked the shit out of her! l fucked her brains out! Stop, stop, let him go... Let him go, Benjamin! Let go of me! Touch her and l'll kill you. l'll kill you! Are you Esp√≥sito? Are you Esp√≥sito or are you Esp√≥sito? Hello? lt's me, did l wake you? No, no... l was working a bit. Why are you up so late? l was thinking... You don't say. Yeah, silly. No, about the novel. l want to read it when it's finished. Great, l'd love that! Sure you don't want to talk a little while? No, l'll drink my tea and see if l can get back to sleep. Okay. Bye. Bye. lThis morning, at the presidential residence in Olivos, the president,l lDo√±a Maria Estela Martinez de Per√≥n...l lrene, lrene! The dressmaker is here! Look, she made the cape like you wanted! Come on and try it on. l'll be right in. lmunicipalities and public facilities located across the country.l lShe personally delivered clothing, school supplies and candyl lto be distributed in Lobos, a village in the province of Buenos Aires.l Hello? Morales, how are you? lt's been ages, what a surprise! Yeah, l'm watching it, but l turned it down. What? lAnd also, thanks to them, we can achieve many things,l lbecause people can't do it all on their own.l lThey help a lot to get everything done.''l Good morning. Miss Menendez Hastings, from Court 42. We're here to see Mr. Romano. He's very busy. What's it about? Sir! Sir! You can't go in there! l'll leave my credentials, don't worry. These two, raising their hands. l want you to get them. Just go and find them. What are you doing here? Are you crazy? No, you are. Ma'am! We need to talk to you. Fellas, would you mind? lf you'd called first, l'd have had coffee ready. lsidoro G√≥mez. Rape and murder, arrested by the court. Penitentiaries informed us he's been freed by Executive Order. We checked, and here we are. Anything to say? Yeah, sure. That you two need to get out more. Justice is nothing but an island. This is the real world. While you two are shooting birds, we're in here, fighting in the middle of the jungle. G√≥mez, G√≥mez, G√≥mez... Yes... He started working with us when he was in jail. He'd give us information, spy on young guerrillas... He did good work! We like him. What's the problem? Don't you agree? Do you realize what you're saying? He's confessed, He's a convicted murderer. Perhaps, but he's also intelligent and brave. He can break into a home and get the job done. His personal life is his own business, right? With all the subversives out there... Who cares? lf we only used good guys... He was arrested under Judge Fortuna's jurisdiction, and we want-- Do you think l don't know you let him go to get back at me? You think l'm stupid? That's two questions. Which one shall l answer first? ls that true? Ma'am... Would you do me a favour? What are you gonna do, file an appeal? No offense, but there's nothing you can do. Except go back to your office, take a seat, and watch and learn. They don't teach the new Argentina at Harvard. And why do you come with her? You think it gives you immunity? Leave her alone, she's out of your league. She studied law, you barely finished high school. She's young, you're old. She's rich, you're poor. She's Menendez Hastings and you're Esposito, a zero. She's untouchable, you aren't. Let her go back to her world. But if you have a problem with me, come alone and we'll settle it. Come on, lrene. Let's go. You do have one thing in common. Neither of you can do a thing about it. You said life. Yes, he should get life. Well, then? These people don't give a shit about justice. And where he is now, we can't get anywhere near him. lf l could, what for? What would l do? What would four bullets get me? A lifetime in jail. Gomez goes free without ever serving and l spend 50 years stuck in a cell, envYIng him... No. No, life in prison would have been fair. l wish l could help, but l honestly don't know how. Who knows? Some other time... Anyway! l'll get it. No, please. lt's just a coffee. l'm very grateful for everything you've done for me. l wouldn't have made it this far without you. l owe you one. Counselor, sir. lt's about the lgarzabal file, sir. Stop calling me Counselor, would you already? lf you do it in front of the judge l'll get in trouble. What about the file? Have you made a copy? l'm on it. No, you aren't. You'd have to be there, but you're here! Come on! Benjamin... Yes? How long before you talk to me again? l talk to you every day. l'm not untouchable. Or from another world. lf only you were... lrene, let's drop it. Drop what? You're marrYIng the engineer, zapiola Menendez Urtubiea and so on. You're not jealous... For God's sake. l hope you live happily ever after. Any objections? No, none. Go on, object. lrene, please... What are you looking at? What do you want? Go away! Where can we meet? What for? So you can present your objections about my life, my fianc√©, my marriage and anything else related to the case. We coulf meet for coffee after work. Time. Eight thirty. Place? Los lnmortales. La Richmond. Sorry, my suggestion wasn't very elegant. No, Benjamin. Somewhere far away from here. Who are you spying on? Sorry. Phone call for you, sir. From a bar? Pablo Sandoval. You cocksucking bastard. Wash your fucking mouth! No, Benjamin... l can't believe they called you. Damn it! l told everyone... ''Don't bother my friend, this is a man's job!'' You're not a man, you stinking drunk. What? Me, drunk? Fuck you! Fascist! Fascist! He's a Nazi! Listen, officer. We're from Court 42, l'll handle it. Don't worry. Come with me. Arrest the motherfuckers! Show them some fucking justice! Come here! My jacket, my jacket! You're wearing it. What time does your wife get home? At eight. How odd. There's no answer... My mouth is dry... Have you got any...? There's no answer! Leave that alone! She's never going to answer. Why? Because the phone doesn't work. What do you mean? Put that down! l told you a thousand times, Benjamin. l wanted to sue their asses. And you didn't help me. That was six months ago! The phone hasn't worked for a year! Motherfuckers never fixed it! Damn it! You can't spend the night here. Put that down! Stop touching stuff. lf you ever called me, you'd know it doesn't work. Leave that. What are you looking for? l wanted to sue them. Look at me. You have a date? No, no! You have a date. And l'm leaving... The last thing l need is you calling me a party pooper. Damn it, too much furniture in here! Sit here! l always run into shit! Have a seat until you feel better. There... Stay there until you feel better. What time is it? l have a watch in the bedroom. What bedroom, idiot? This is my house. Yes... lt's alright, we're okay. Easy... Come on Benja... l'll go try to convince your wife not to kill you. Call her on the phone. You said it didn't work. Mine doesn't work, Benjamin... Use yours. Just stay here. Don't touch anything, don't do anything. l'll be right back. Turn off the light. We'll catch that son of a bitch! We'll catch him... We were working all day... Save it for some other time. Please, let me explain. lt's the last time! Okay, okay. Be patient with him, he needs help. He needs help? No, l know... What l mean is, if we help him, it's easier for everyone. You want to get rid of him. Don't say that! What's this? What happened? Hold on a second. Pablo! What happened? l don't know! Pablo! Don't scare me! Hold on! Pablo! Hey!... Nooo! What, what happened?! Nooo... What happened? No! No, no! What happened? What happened? This is madness. lt will be if that bastard finds you. He's gonna go after you. No, my father knows who to talk to. He works for Romano, Romano won't mess with me. Don't worry, l'll be fine! But, Jujuy! For God's sake, lrene! My cousins are like feudal lords there. Nobody will touch you. Not Romano, not anyone. What will l do in Jujuy?! Same as here. Sign and stamp... They have your desk ready. No, no, no no, no lrene, l can't! l can't. l have my life here, l have my old man! l have everything here. What we can do here? Us... We can't do anything. Bye. lt's a rough draft. l'll make more. Your house is exactly as l imagined it. How did you imagine it? Exactly like this. Exactly like l imagined it. Sure, l imagined your house would be totally different. You've seen my house? No, l mean unlike this one. Totally different. What does this mean? Huh? This piece of paper says ''l FEAR'' No! No no no no... lt's just something l did... A writing excercise, half asleep... To inspire imagination... Neve rmind. Okay, shoot. lt's a novel, it doesn't have to be true, or even believable. Yes... No, what? lt isn't believable? No, Benjamin. That part when... When the guy leaves for Jujuy... What's the problem? CrYIng like he's all broken up... So what? Her running on the platform after the man of her dreams... Well... Touching hands through the glass, like they're one. And her crYIng, as if she knew her fate was mediocrity and never loving anyone, practically falling on the tracks, proclaiming love she'd never had the courage to confess... That's what happened, isn't it? lf that's what happened, why didn't you take me with you? Dimwit. How does the case proceed? l don't know. l can say he spent 10 years counting llamas in the Andes. And when l came back you were D.A., married and with two kids. Should l put that? Or that he came back married to a Jujuyan princess, pretty, rich... She was wonderful. lt wasn't her fault l could never love her. lt's a lousy ending. lt's crap. You see? l don't want to miss another chance. How can l do nothing about it? l've been asking myself for 25 years and l've only been able to come up with one answer. ''Forget it, it was another lifetime. lt's over, don't ask.'' lt wasn't another lifetime. lt was this one. lt lS ths one. l want to understand. How can someone live an empty life? How do you live a life full of nothing? How do you do it? This is a waste of time. We'll never find him! Trust me, remember how formal he was? Nobody notifies a change of address. Mine's from when l danced the pata-pata. Gomez, lsidoro. Espora 691 , Chivilcoy. You see, that's his mother. Sir, we are required by law to notify a change of address. lt's not something we do because we feel like it. Understand? l do now. Morales, Ricardo. There's one, two... Four, ma'am. Let's search by l.D. number. What's your first number? Three, what's yours? What do you care? What? l can't...? Here's a 5 and a 6. Morales, Ricardo Augustin. He changed addresses in 1975. Write this down, pata-pata. Who are you looking for? Morales. How are you? Remember me? Esposito. From the courts... 25 years ago. Quite a surprise. l know, sorry. How are you? Everything okay? Such a long time. What a surprise! Yeah... Come in, please. Shall l make coffee? Coffee? You're not drinking mate out here? Out here? l'm in the bank all day long. You're still at the bank? l'll take that coffee. You moved out here right after. Yes. l wanted to start over, from scratch. That's the good thing about the bank. They have branches everywhere. There's always a branch nobody wants, so here l am, with a promotion and everything. How about that... Remember Liliana? Yes, of course. How are you doing? Still here. No, l mean single, married... No! No, really... l think l just... At that point, just closed shop. l tried, but you know what? lt's complicated. l got married. You don't say. Yeah, for a while, but it didn't work. l don't know if it was me... lt's complicated. lt's complicated. Quite a story, l can't believe it. Never thought l had a novel in me. You should flesh it out. lt's like a long memo. Crazy. l could never forget it. A mistake. You should put it behind you, trust me. You came here because of Gomez, right? What do you mean? He was on the loose, he might come looking for you. No, no. l'm not scared of Gomez. Maybe he's dead. Maybe. They came looking for me. Yes, l know. How do you know? l just read it. They found your friend. Yes, poor Sandoval. Do you remember Sandoval? No! No... My coworker at the courts. They came looking for me, didn't find me and let him have it. Bastards! G√≥mez was never found, right? Guess. Those guys always get away with it. You know, there's something l need to ask you. How did you learn to live without Liliana? lt was 25 years ago, Esposito. l was sure you wouldn't be able to. lt was 25 years ago, Esposito. Especially with him on the loose. How did you start over? lt was 25 years ago! Forget it. lf it weren't for me, you wouldn't have made it this far. You owe me one. l don't know what you want me to say! You didn't care the guy got a free ride!? There was nothing l could do. - No? - No! - No!? - NO! You spent a year looking for the guy, they let him go and you do nothing? l wasted a year looking for him on train stations, and they let him go! What can l do? That's it? Yes! The rest of your life behind a desk? Look who's talking. You're better than l am. What do you care? lt's my life, not yours. No, Morales, it's my life too! Your love for that woman... l never saw it again! ln anybody! Nobody! Ever! Get out of my house! Right now, please! lt's my life, not yours. l'm sorry, l'm getting old, that's it. That might be it... l couldn't stop thinking about it! Go dwell on it at home! G√≥mez didn't kill Sandoval. So? G√≥mez knew us both! lf he'd been there, he'd have waited for me. There's something... l had a couple of photos at home, of myself. When Sandoval got killed, the photos had been turned over. Nothing else had been touched. l thought... l think... Are you Esp√≥sito? Huh? Did you hear what l said, asshole? Are you Esposito? What's going on? What are you doing? Huh? Answer me! Where are you going!? Stop it, dude... Where are you going? Here... What are you going to do? l'm going to put on a record. lt's okay. You're going to put on a record? Listen to me, are you Esp√≥sito or not? Yes, l am. l'm so ashamed l can't even bring myself to put flowers on his grave. Maybe that's not what happened. Maybe he fell asleep and they killed him without him even realizing, somebody knocked over the photos by accident, bumped into them... l don't know what to think anymore. Choose carefully. Memories are all we end up with. At least pick the nice ones. But there's one thing l know l'll never forget. The last thing Pablo said to me the night they killed him. ''Don't worry, Benjamin. We'll catch that son of a bitch.'' And l will. lf he's alive, l will. Well... Wait, come in... Sit down. You can stop looking. l couldn't go to the authorities. l knew the guy was untouchable. But l also knew sooner or later he'd come looking for you. lMeet you there, at nine o'clock!l Hey, G√≥mez! l got rid of the body and obviously he wasn't missed. Was it worth it? Forget about it! Forget it! Who cares? My wife is dead! Your friend is dead! Gomez is dead too! They're all dead! Stop dwelling on it! You'll start wondering if you could have stopped it... You'll have a thousand pasts and no future! Forget about it, trust me. You'll end up with only memories. l owed you one, right? Now we're even. lForget about it, forget it!l l couldn't stop thinking about it./ What would four bullets get me? lt's my life, not yours. Go dwell on it at home! We'll catch him... l've been wondering for 25 years. Bye. lt wasn't another lifetime. /t was this one./ A guy can do anything to be different. What would four bullets get me? But there's one thing he can't change. Not him, not you, not anybody. How can someone live an empty life? How do you live a life full of nothing? How do you do it? Please! l fucked the shit out of her! What retribution? lPlease, please!l lt's as if his wife's death just left him there, stuck in time forever. My wife is dead! Your friend is dead! G√≥mez is dead too! They're all dead! They'd give him an injection and he'd take a nap. lNobody, Benjamin.l Let him grow old. Live a life full of nothing. lHow did you start over?l lThat was 25 years ago! 25 years, Esposito! iForget about it!l Please. Tell him... Tell him at least to talk to me. Please... You said life. ''l FEAR'' ''l LOVE YOU'' ls she in? Yeah, in her office? You're alive! Yeah... l need to talk to you. Shall l bring coffee, Ma'am? Go away. lt'll be complicated. l don't care. Shut the door.
