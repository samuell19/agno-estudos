OK. Help me! Somebody help me! Help me! Help me! Please! Shh! Help! Please! well? Did you send it? Did you send the email? The pictures? Yes,... I sent them. They're sent. we need to keep you hydrated. Understand? Please nod if you understand. Now, for you to drink, I need to take off the gag. Please, do not scream. We do not want to hurt you. And we certainly don't wanna kill you. But we are prepared to do either or both of these things if we need to. - Do you understand? - Yeah. Please! Please, let me go. - I have a daughter She needs me. - Shh! Please. we know you don't have a daughter. we know everything about you. It's a natural response, but trying to reason with us is... Listen to me. The only people who can get you out of here are him and me. We are your only friends. I urge you to do as we say. Now,... are you going to be quiet and drink from the bottle? Good. If you need the bathroom, wait until we come in and give us this signal. Try to hold it in, because we won't be changing your sheets or your clothes. Do you understand? Good. - We should keep a clear head. - I need a drink. Just one. Make sure its not on your breath in there and she can't smell it on you. - Why? - Because we're not fucking amateurs! Fine. I'll chew some gum after. - You should eat, keep your energy up. - I'm not hungry. I don't care. Eat. - I said eat! - I don't want to. - What? - Eat. - Eat it. - I said I'm not hungry. For fuck's sake! What was that for? I told you, I'm not hungry. You haven't eaten for nine hours and you're not hungry? No! what? If you're not hungry, it means something's not right. You're thinking too much. About whether we've done everything right, or we've made a mistake that will get us caught and get us 20 years in jail. Or maybe you're thinking about whether we have to rough up that girl. Or perhaps even kill her. Or worse. Or you're getting senti-fucking-mental now this girl isn't just theoretical. Now you've looked into her eyes, maybe you're having second thoughts. Maybe your conscience is eating away at your conviction. Maybe you're persuading yourself that the best thing to do is to just go in there, untie her and let her go. Well, you listen to me. Fuck... that! You understand? Look at me. Look at me. Fuck... that! We are in this. And we are too far along to get fucking squeamish. Now, any doubts that you have are just bullshit. They're just knee-jerk bullshit and you know it. You know it. You know you know it. So you say it. - Say what? - Fuck... that! Fuck that. - Again. - Fuck that. Now don't think, eat. We've got a long night ahead. I'm sorry if I hurt you. We should check on her before I leave. Well? How come I have to do the dog work? Because that's your role. Now go and check on her. Bathroom alert. Do you need a number one or a number two? Show me with your fingers. Ready? Done? - You going already? - Yeah. It's time. Be careful. Remember to dump the phone. - I'm not stupid. - Just reminding you. Don't sleep. Check on her. And don't drink. Sure. whatever. No, not whatever,... you just do it. You just keep your head in the fucking game! - Do you understand? - Yep. Fucking dick. what happened? Did you make the call? Yeah. I made it. So how did it go? - It went fine. - So he's going to pay? - He said yes, but... - what? There was a click. - The police were listening in. - Police? It's OK. - We knew this'd happen eventually. - Not so fucking soon! We planned for this. That's why we dumped the phone. - We planned for this, so calm down. - So what did he say? He wanted to speak to his daughter, make sure she was still alive. - And? - I said no. - They wanted time to trace the call. - Trace? Fuck me! Calm! - We are OK. - But he agreed? - He agreed to the money, the timings? - Yes. He'll get the money in the morning. No sequential notes, tracers, paint bombs. Good. Good. But I wanna be sure. We need to make sure he goes to that bank as soon as it opens and he gets that money out as fast as he fucking can. We need you to do something. He's going to untie you. When he does, you're gonna sit on the edge of the bed and stay very, very still. Understand? You're going to look into this camera and speak to your father. Tell him he must pay the money. He must do exactly as we ask or we will kill you. You tell him that you have no doubt that we will kill you. Understand? - Yes. - Good. Take one. Daddy,... ..I'm OK. They just took me. I was leaving the house and they just took me. I don't know where I am. Stop! I don't want a narrative. I just want you to tell him that unless he pays the money we will kill you. Any deviation from our instructions, we will kill you. Any police, we will kill you! - Understand? - Yes. No. She's not scared enough. Give her some motivation. That's better. Now,... get yourself together and try again. Daddy,... ..I love you. Please,... ..pay them the money. Do exactly as they say or they will kill me. Daddy, they will kill me if you don't. Please, Daddy! Just do exactly as they say. Please just pay them the money. I want to come home. Just give them the money. Please! Thank you. No! No, please! I won't... My arms hurt! Uncuff her. Move them around a bit. Go on. - Better? - A little. Tie her up. Please, Daddy! Just pay them the money. I want to come home. Just give them the money. Please! This is good. This'll work. - She did well. - She did. She was a good choice. She was a good find, Danny. Don't fall asleep. These'll keep you awake. Keep an eye on her. She's worth a lot of money to us. I know. Take care. No! I can't. I can't! Take it out! I can't. I can't go with you watching me. Could you just leave me alone for a few minutes, please? I can't shit with you staring at me! Just... Please! I can't do it with you standing there and looking at me! Let me go! Let me go! Give me the fucking keys for the cuffs! - Keys! - Whoa! whoa! Fuck! I'll kill you! - And I'll get the keys from your body. - Wait! It's me, Danny! It's me! It's Danny. - What? - Its me, Alice. What...? - It's me. - Danny! - What the... fuck are you doing?! - Put the gun down. - The gun, Alice. The gun! - Was it you? - There's a plan. - A plan?! Fuck! Danny! Put the fucking gun down before you kill me, Alice. Just get me the fuck out of here. - Unlock me right fucking now. - I will, OK? Just listen to me first. We're getting money from your dad. - What? - A lot of money. - You're always saying you hate him. - What are you on about? You hate him, Alice. He cut you off. He's got all that money and he'll never give you any more! We talked about how to get his money. This is it, Alice. This is how. This is how we get his money. - But you fucking kidnapped me! - Yes! I kidnapped you for us. The money's for us. It's all for us. - What?! - Look, this is a good thing, Alice. Good? You fucking kidnapped me. You fucking stripped me naked! You made me piss in a fucking bottle in front of...! Who?! who the fuck is the other man? Do I know him too? No. He's Victor. He's Vic. He's no one. He's no one. - I met him inside. He doesn't know. - Know what? About us. He thinks you're just a random rich girl. He's not got the whole picture. He thinks all this is his plan. He doesn't... He doesn't suspect we'll take all the money. All of it. Me and you. You fucking kidnapped me so I could get some of my dad's money? Well,... yeah. Then why the fuck didn't you ask me first?! I thought I was going to fucking die! I was fucking terrified! I know, I know. I'm sorry, alright, but it had to look real. Feel real. For Vic. For you! Look real?! You can't fucking do that to somebody, Danny. Make them think they're gonna fucking die! You can't fake fear, Alice. Not proper fear. If you were pretending, he would have known. You told me you loved me. You told me... that you loved me. I do, babe. That's why. That's why I did this, because I love you. - I was gonna tell you after... - what would you have said? "Sorry I fucking kidnapped you? Sorry I humiliated you?" But we'll be rich, Alice. Rich. How much? How much am I worth? Two million. He's gonna pay. Two million. Cash. Untraceable. All you have to do is lie in that bed. Tied up. Humiliated. - Abused. - It'll only be for another day or so. Not much to ask for two million. For a whole new life. Alice,... I love you. Truly. So can I have my gun back? Alice, please. Just do this. Fuck! That's him. It's Vic. He's back. You have to give me the gun. If I don't answer the door, he'll kick in it. If he comes in here and finds us like this, he'll go fucking crazy. He'll fucking kill us both. You won't escape, Alice. He'll kill you. I'm not joking. Don't be stupid. Give me the gun. Please. - Don't let him fucking hurt me. - I won't. Danny,... promise me. I promise. - Where the fuck where you? - She needed a shit. - I had to keep the gun on her. - By yourself? - It was no problem. I just flushed it. - Look at me. Look at me! - Ls she OK? - Yeah. Go look if you like. Did you speak to her dad? He saw the video? He understands the gravity of the situation. - So when's the exchange? - Tomorrow. - You made the arrangement? - No. They can't have time to prepare. As soon as he gets the money, we start moving. - So we're cool? - Yeah. - This is gonna work? - Of course it is. Get some sleep. Busy day tomorrow. - Don't you want to? - No. I've still got adrenaline running through me. You sleep first. - Shall I check on her? - I think I can handle it for a while. - If you're sure. - Go ahead. Use this. Thanks. Sleep tight. Fuck! What time is it? Why didn't you wake me up? I didn't mean to fucking fall asleep, did l? Shit, the girl! Wake up! Jesus! Fuck! wake up, Miss Creed. It's breakfast time! It's minestrone. It's hot. Oops! Got it. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Sorry. What are you doing? Get back there and keep an eye on her. Finished. Good. Open up. Give it to me. Give me... the spoon. - What's got into you? - Nothing. I'm fine. You don't look fine. Don't start thinking. - I need you focused. - I am. - Are you sure? - I'm solid, Vic. Good. Because I need you. I can't do this without you. You've got me. Good boy. Where are you going? Take a piss. ls that alright? You OK in there? - Danny, what's wrong? - Everything's fine! - Are you sure? - Look, I'll just be a second! Danny, are you OK in there? Danny? Danny! Danny! - What the fuck are you doing?! - Nothing! Danny, open this door right now before I kick it in! Open this fucking door! Open this fucking door now! Right! I'm coming in! Jesus, Vic! what the fuck?! Why the fuck didn't you open the door? I didn't know what you... - I was worried. - I said I'd be out in a second. Something wouldn't go down. - You said you just needed a piss? - I thought I did. It's gone now. Third time's the charm. - What? - It doesn't smell of anything in here. My shit don't stink, what can I say? Just wash your hands and stop fucking about. It's the adrenaline. The sudden need to shit. A bitter taste in your mouth. Because of the adrenaline. Happened to me when I made the first call. Just relax, Danny. Were nearly there. Not long until the bank opens. Then after that, it's show time. We're gonna be rich. Me and you. We are gonna be millionaires. We're nearly there, Dan. We're nearly there. You holding up? I'm good. You sure? Positive. In two days, we are gonna be the other side of the world. Just me and you. Just me and you. Away from all this shit. Away from the past. Starting new lives. Being new people. Being happy. For the first two weeks,... we'll hardly get out of bed. We will just order room service and fuck each other senseless. - Sounds perfect. - It does, don't it? I've gotta go. I'll see you soon. - You take care. - You too. I love you. Love you too, babe. Hey. - You alright? - Where is he? - Out. It's gonna happen soon. - The bullet case, I thought he saw it. It's OK. I got rid of it. - How long till he comes back? - An hour, I guess. Maybe less. Untie me. Come on, Danny, untie me. He's gone. Danny? The other one. Danny, what's wrong? Come on, Danny, unlock it. - Don't you trust me? - Of course, but... But what? I let you gag me, tie me back up! I fucking trusted you. - So you can fucking trust me! - I do trust you. - But what? You think I'm gonna run? - I don't know, I don't... Look, were close to the end, right? When he comes back, we'll take you to the exchange. - And were gonna get the money? - Yeah. Why would I run? I'm sorry. I'm just jumpy. - This is fucking stressful. - You think? Thanks. Those things really fucking pinch. Got pins and needles in my fingers and toes. Here. - Better? - Thanks. Danny, what if your friend...? Vic, what if he... what if he's on to us and suspects something? - He doesn't. - If he does? Believe me, he hasn't got a clue. - How did you do it? - What? - Get him to agree to pick me for this? - You fit his criteria. Rich father, female, mid-20s, only child. - Slim enough to carry easy. - Jesus! Vic's been planning this forever. The whole time we were in prison he talked about it. I never really thought he'd do it, but... ..when he got out, he contacted me. We set about looking for a target. Of course,... I didn't have to look very far. You suggested me. - You didn't say we knew each other? - Of course not. Your dad's on the Rich List. I said I just read your name in that newspaper article about him. I even cut it out and gave it to Vic. He went for you right away. He said you were... perfect. - Where is he now? - Arranging the exchange. - Where will it be? - Out near the river. We'll drive you nearby, where you can't escape and your dad can't find you. - Then Vic gets the money. - By himself? - I'll stay with you. - He could steal it and disappear. - He won't. - How can you be sure? I just am. Trust me. He's not even considered it. When he's getting the money, I'll be setting you free. Once he has the money, I'm gonna take it from him. Then we meet up, - get the fuck out of here. - How will you take the money? He trusts me. It'll be easy. - He trusts you? - Completely. - Danny. - What? - I'm scared. - Don't be. - I'm sorry! - Hey. It's alright. I won't let anything happen to you. Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine. - Danny. - What? I love you so much. I love you too, babe. what the fuck?! Alice, what the fuck?! - Alice, this isn't funny. Unlock me. - No. What the fuck are you doing?! - What the fuck do you think I'm doing? - You can't do this. - Fuck you. - We're so close! Close to what? You fucking kidnapped me, you cunt! - You expect me to just let it happen?! - But we had a plan. No, you had a plan. This is my plan. Alice. Alice, come back! Alice! Fuck! Police. Quick. I need the police. Come and get me. I've been kidnapped. I haven't got much time. I don't know where I am, no. I've been locked in, I can't get out. Erm... wait, I'll, erm... No, I don't recognise anything. I'm up high. Can't you trace the call? Yeah? Thank God! How long will that take? How long? No, you have to come and get me now. The other man's coming back. He'll kill me. He's gonna fucking kill me! You have to come now! Right fucking now! Calm down?! He's gonna fucking kill me! He's... wait a second. l... I think I can get the keys. I love you. I fucking love you. And you love me. I know you do. - Where are the keys? - Alice, please, you can't do this. - I love you. - No, Danny. When you love someone, you do everything you can to care for them. What you don't do is kidnap them! Understand? You don't jump them in the street and put them in the back of a van. You don't put a fucking knife to their throat! The keys! I swear to God, Danny. You need to tell me where the keys are. My pocket. Right-hand pocket. Get back on the bed. Get back on the fucking bed! Don't fucking move. The safety was on. Not any more. - The keys. - I can't breathe! Throw me the fucking keys! Come on. Fuck, come on! Thank fuck. Fuck! Why didn't you just listen to me? It all would have been alright if you'd just listened to me. Fuck you. Everything OK? - Top notch. - She still in there? - Where else would she be? - Yeah. Yeah, 'course. It's just... - It's time. It's on. - He's got the money? Yeah. He's just waiting for the location. This is really gonna fucking work. We have to move her out and put her in the warehouse. - When do we move? - Now. we move now. This is it. Were gonna have to move you now, understand? Nod if you understand. Hey! wake up! She's out cold. what happened? What the fuck did you do? - Nothing. I thought she was asleep. - The gag, she can't breathe. ls she alright? Wait here. Come on. Thank God! I thought we'd half killed her. Wake up! Miss Creed! Wake up! Say something! - Hey. - Are you OK? Say something! Hey! You need to calm down. She's alright. Everything's fine. Just give her a minute to breathe. Come on. Let's just have a minute together. To refocus. Come on. - Look at me. Are you alright? - Yeah. It's just... - will you do something for me? - What? Tell me what to do. I need you to stop worrying, and just be Vic. Vic's confident. Vic pushes me around. Vic's mean. - Mean? - Mean as fuck. That's the Vic I want. That's the Vic I fell for. So, come on, push me around. Tell me what to do. Stand the fuck up. Go and put on your coat. Go and put the van into position. The van? - Now? - Yes, fucking now. - What are you gonna do? - Pack the bag. - Why don't I pack the bag and...? - Just fucking go do it! Now! Go on! No, please. No, wait. No, wait, please. wait a second. No, please! what the fuck?! How did you get this? How the fuck did you get this? Quietly. Tell me how you got it. - Tell me. - I don't know. - How did you fucking get it?! - I don't know! I don't want to cause any trouble. I just want to do exactly as you say. 999? The police? Did you call the police? - Did you call the fucking police? - No! I don't know! - Tell me the truth! - L... How could l? I've been tied up since I got here. - How did you get it?! - I don't know! - Tell me the truth! - I don't know! I don't know! - Tell me! - Please, stop! - Tell me! - I don't know! Tell me! Tell me! Fucking tell me! Please, stop! Please, stop! Don't! Danny, help me! Danny! Danny! Danny! - How do you know that name? - Danny! Danny, please help me! - How do you know that name?! - Danny! How do you know that name? - You know him? - No! l... - He just told me his name. - He gave you the phone? - No! - Well, if I didn't and you're tied down... - ..then who else is there? - I don't know. Please. - Please. Please. - Oh, fuck! Fuck! - Please. Just take me home. - Shut up! - What happened here? - Nothing. Just take me home. Please. Please. - This is a bullet. - I don't know. - I don't know. - Who fired the gun? who fired the gun?! Please just take me home! Don't! Please! You tell me or I swear to God you will never see your family again. Tell me. I fired it. I needed the toilet. He turned his back. I hit him. I got his gun. Well, if you got the gun,... - ..why are you still here? - Because... Because he's gonna fuck you. He's gonna take the money. The whole two million. I'm still here because he made a deal with me. He said that if I went along with the plan, he would... He'd give you some of the money. It all happened so quickly. You were coming back... I couldn't get away, so... I agreed. - I'm sorry. - Danny! But now you know, you can... you can go along with the plan. You can just pick up the money and you can disappear. You can fuck him instead, right? You can take the money. All of it. Fuck him, right? You can just... take me back to my father. You can take me back to my family. All I want is to go back to my home! Please! Please! Please! what's my name? What? L... I don't know. - I don't know your name. - Yes, you do. He told you. Now tell me, please. He didn't tell me your name. - Please. - You're lying. - I just wanna go home. - I can see you're lying. I just wanna go home. Please! No! Please! - What's wrong? - Why would anything be wrong? - You just seem a bit... - A bit what? Shall we gag her up? I already did it. - I was just in there. - You were? She alright? Vic, is she alright? I'm going for a piss. Wait here. Danny, tell me something, why did you choose her? I didn't choose her. - You chose her. - Yeah, but you suggested her. why? You know why. I read about her in the newspaper. What's this all about, Vic? - Something doesn't feel quite right. - What do you mean? - Just now, she was acting funny. - Why, what did she say? Say? - Why do you think she'd say anything? - I don't... You said she was acting funny. Yeah, but I didn't say she'd said anything. What could she say? What do you think she would say? Come here. I said... come here. - Tell me you love me. - What? Tell me... that you love me. I love you, babe. Totally. Let's get this thing done. No! Wait here. - What happened to her face? - I told you. She was acting funny. So I had to give her a slap. Right, now give me your set of keys. You've got yours, why do you want mine? Because you don't need them any more, do you? - What, is there a problem? - No problem. Then give 'em to me. Right,... let's go. - Go where? - Let's go and get the money. Both of us? - The plan was I'd stay here. - Plan's changed. - Changed? - I need you at the meet. - Ln case of any surprises. - Like what? If I knew, they wouldn't be surprises! What if something happens? What if we don't make it back? - We'll make it. - But if we... If we don't, she'll be stuck here. - She'll die. - So? If we don't make it, why do you care if she don't make it? - I don't care. - Good. Now, let's get the fuck out of here. - You think it's there? - Yeah. It's there. Now go and get it. - Me?! - Danny,... just go and get the fucking money! Now! There's no fucking money. They fucked us over. - They fucked it up. - No, they didn't fuck up. The money's not here because this isn't the location. But the hole... - This hole is for the money. - No. No, this hole's for you, Danny. They didn't fuck up, you did. Please,... don't do this! I beg you! Please! - What did you tell her about me? - Nothing! Nothing! You told her my name. Only your first name. Only that we met in prison. That's it. You fucking idiot! You've killed her, Danny. You've not only killed yourself,... but you have killed her too. You don't have to do this. We can just finish this. Like we planned. We'll go away. We'll be happy. I'll do whatever you want me to. It'll be just me and you. It's all we want. I love you. Close your eyes. Danny, close your eyes. You remember when we met? Eh? Remember? When they first led me in the cell? I was scared. I was so fucking scared! But you protected me. You... helped me. I'll never forget that. I'll never... Danny! Fuck! Danny! Help me! Please! Shh.

When you held me. - When you kissed me. - Shut the fuck up! When you made love to me. There's no faking that. You love me. So you give me the gun and I will get you fixed up. - Give me the gun. - No, Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny, don't give him the gun. - It's OK, my little Danny boy. - No! - Don't give him the gun. - It's OK. Get me out of here, Danny. Don't give him... It's OK. Shh. Don't cry. Danny.
