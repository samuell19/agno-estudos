That is something - Do you know who I just wrestled for? - No - Willard. - You don't mean Joe Willard? - Mr. Joseph Willard, yes. - How did you make out? He must think that I'm very good, because he went out laughing very much That's fine,Polakai. I'm so glad Listen,Polakai,he's a great pal of mine this Willard I know him well and I can do you a lot of good with him - You know him,Nicky? - Polakai,you're a friend You put yourself in my hands and I'll make you champion of the whole world - Maybe - I can do it - Laura, you hear? - I heard I forgot ... - Nicky,I forgot. - Forgot what? Hear,wait a minute. I'll get it,you wait here We're all set,there is nothing to worry about not a thing in the world to worry about now Nicky Nicky,look Look at that Look at that This is even better than being champion from Germany Hi boys Hello champ,glad to see you,a long time say put up a great show the other day. Willard, my name is Nicky Grant. I thought we were going to talk business alone I am Polakai's manager. You're going to talk business with me. I thought that guy Herman was your manager No, Herman,he's selling beer over in Hoboken und Nicky,he's my manager now All right, no reason why we all can't get along. - A chair - Come along champ - Over here,Polakai - Polakai, please. Mr. Willard, what I want to do is to wrestle That's fine,that's all we want you to do,just wrestle No songs,dances, or funny say,just wrestle That's what we are here for,Joe let's talk business. - OK Mr.. - Grant. Mr Grant, I was talking to the champ I just want to be sure he understands how we play ball here. - Play ball not wrestle? - Well,here it what it means There are lots of wrestlers, smart wrestlers and dumb wrestlers - That's right - That's right The dumb wrestlers are always trying to win. The smart wrestlers grab the dough I'm a very smart wrestler, in Germany I win all the matches. That's what I just mean. It ain't always so smart to win - Not win? - Maybe we don't understand each other Here it is,right on the table You're going to wrestle for me,you're going to win when I tell you to win and you're going to lose when I tell you to lose. We'll give you plenty of publicity and build you up rising. Be a nice boy and do what you are told, We'll even give you a chance of the championship. - Fair enough? - I don't,I don't understand He says that when he says that I lose,I lose And when he says that I win,I win.. I don't understand that's funny business Now listen,Polakai, why don't you get smart? You are not in Germany now, you're in America. - You want that I should fool the people? - No, did I say that? But that's a crooked business. Listen,why don't you calm down. That is crooked! You insult me,Mr. Willard. Well,you're a big lug, I ought to throw you out of here. - That's right,Joe. - Throw me out? Here Throw me out! I'll throw you out! - Listen,don't be a fool - Fool? I'm no fool I'm the champion from Germany. I only want wrestling match, not more. All right,I'll give you a wrestling match. Next Wednesday night. Let's see you win. Then come back here and talk business. - That's fair enough? - That's good,that's an honest man I'll show him how we wrestle in Germany. - We do good matches - Ya,ya We wrestle,in fatherland,we wrestle - That's it,ja - Ja - Goodbye, Willard. - Goodbye. A big dumb Dutchman Hey,are you going to let that guy wrestle? Sure I'm going to let him wrestle And you are going to referee. Dad,is that the right thing to win? Shameful, this is a shame! Go Go... That's robbery -That's wrong! -What you've done You are a fine manager,you are! Everybody showed the way it was You saw it was rigged and you do nothing! Oh,it's his funeral,if he wants to be a mug,it's OK with me What are you talking about? Nicky, you know I win that decision. I am the best man,you know that! Sure, you won the decision, but did you get it? Ah,Nicky let me tell you for the last time, that I will not wrestle crooked I will not wrestle crooked! Hey, pipped Too bad! What you need is a little more experience. You'll be all right just keep on trying. Hear referee,he's down now He's down! Surprise! No, I guess not,must have been too little surprise,eh? "I was a man once you got me wrong" Maybe that attitude won't be so cold when she realizes that we are pushing that big hump of flesh into a million dollars. It may take another shellacking like last Wednesday night to get that through that big head but he'll come around The reception might even be warmer when the money starts rolling in,how baby? Now.It doesn't mean a thing old boy. The lady won't talk Nicky,maybe you're getting old. Breaking up,maybe you're not the type anymore.
