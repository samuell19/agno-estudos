Once upon a time... somewhere on Réunion Island Nelson, come on. Let's go. Bye. - See you later. Love you. - Me too. Still here? Get going. Bye, Grandma. Bye. Wait, please! "On leaving school We encountered A large railroad That led us Round the Earth In a golden wagon Round the Earth We encountered The sea at large With all its shells And its scented islands And fine shipwrecks In the golden wagon..." THE ISLAND BIRD Hi! Your eggs, chef. Cool. - Your fritters. - Thanks. Hide! - Don't stay there! - Ok. Bye. See you later. They didn't spot us. "We encountered A large railroad That led us Round the Earth..." Hi. - Got my fritters? - Later. - Hurry up. - Coming. Nelson, if I were you, I'd learn by singing because your work depends on your motivation and you're last again. Roman, try harder. Samy, nice work. Gabriel... Look. - What is it? - My video. Want to share with us? Come up here. Recite today's poem. We're listening. "On leaving school..." "On leaving school We encountered A large..." "Railroad". I heard you. "A large railroad..." "That led us..." "That led us..." Where? To the corner. Pepper fritters! Pepper fritters! New recipe. With eggs. 3 euros a cone. Get lost, kid. - I'm going. - And stay away. Pepper fritters! 40 cents a fritter, 3 euros a cone! What did I say? - I get it. - Don't come back. - Got my lesson? - Yes. Our teacher asked about you. - What did you say? - Nothing. But I missed you today. You got nerves again? A little. I bet Star Kids will pick you. Our video was awesome. Then again... Then again what? You'll need to sing for the jury. Why couldn't I? I sang in the video. It's ok, chill. Rihanna gets nerves too. I don't get nerves. If they pick you, control the nerves you don't get. You'd better get picked, cos I won't go back to the orphanage. The finest French songs Tonight at 9 PM Wait. Stay here. Paul won't let you in. Seriously? We're a team. We get the results together. We'll meet you at the computer. Come on, Zizou. I'll use the main door one day. Dream on. On a red carpet! Yeah, sure. You can't come in. Good to see you! I have orders. We have a special guest. You stay out. My mum loves your conscientious side. - She says that? - Always. My homework has to be orderly as Paul. She's right. But you stay there. Too bad. Wait for me, we're a team! Paul gave you the brush-off. No, I'm just sparing him trouble. Sure. Hide. One, two... Hear me, Bruno? Turn up the voice. I came to say I'm going away More reverb. - Everything ok? - Fine, sir. Reverb. I came to say I'm going away Turn it up. Your tears won't change what I say More reverb. Why isn't it working? I plugged it in. Turn the voice up. The voice. This one? Bruno! My tinnitus! My mistake. I'll behave now. Sorry, Bruno. From the top. Aren't we going? See you at the computer. As Verlaine said on a windy day Let's go. I came to say I'm going away You remember the old days and weep I'll let you work. Thank you, sir. Farewell, I cannot stay I'm sorry to say I'm going away Careful, my mum! Your tears won't change what I say As Verlaine said... Ok, let's go. Mrs Bengué! I need to tell you... No nuts for Mr Leroy, our singer. He's allergic. What's your latest miracle? Mrs Bengué, you're an artist. If I were you, I'd add a little... Or maybe not. Well, I'll let you work. No nuts, remember. Hurry. I'm busy. Well? They picked him? Not another! Go with your sister. "Dear Sir, we're happy to inform you that you've been selected..." Star Kids, here I come! They picked him for Star Kids! - The TV show? - Yes. - Great! - Ok, get lost now. Ok, thank you. - Don't loiter! - Ok. I have an idea. Stage 2 now. - Stage 2? - Pierre Leroy, your coach. Seriously? He sings old folks' stuff. - Hi, Sam, is my class here? - Yes. The stage is taken. Use the Bourbon room. What's going on? See you later. Reception, can I help you? - What's this shower? - Yes, Mr Leroy. The damn thing doesn't work! The shower's too hot or too cold? We'll send someone. Our apologies, Mr... Leroy. - What now? - We see your coach. Count me out! It's your big break. He's a huge star with loads of hits. Name one. One hit, before my mum was born. Not the best choice. He's all we have. You need a coach for the auditions. I'll have one there. - But where is he? - Room 204. How d'you know? I searched his jacket. - You stole his keys? - His wallet. Give me that. Coming. You're quick anyhow. For the shower? I wouldn't say no. Sorry, I'm out of change. We're not beggars. You look the part. Seen your mug? Zizou... Drop it, he's a jerk. - Who is this guy? - A total jerk. Just a second. Not beggars, thieves. But we found it. Sure. Give it to me. Will you listen? One minute. It's so classy here. First, introductions. I'm Mia. My baby brother, Zidane, but call him Zizou like everyone else. I'm the stylist and agent of an artiste on the verge of an international career. He's talented, with a golden voice. Nelson. 30 seconds. Star Kids picked him. He'll go to Paris to be a star like you. Only better because... Thanks, Zidane. The trouble is, like all stars, he can't calm his nerves. It's not nerves, it's more like... So we want you to coach him. We have no one else. Your time's up. My wallet. Out! Off you go! It's urgent, so can we start now? - No. - Tomorrow? Ok, tomorrow. Out you go now. What now? The shower... You know where it is. Everyone showers here? Wait. A present. I made it. What is it? - A fritter. - Thanks. Holy shit! It's hot! Stage two validated. Validated? He's stringing us along. Zidane, what's that? - I found it. - Found it? - Like that? - Unbelievable. If he calls the cops, it's back to the orphanage! We'll be parted. Want that? I won't do it again. I'm sick of him. Zizou, come on! Why are you here? Want me to lose my job? I have a good excuse, Mum. What is it? I got 18/20 for my poem. And my teacher picked me to represent the school in the schools' contest. Is that true? My son at the schools' contest? That's great for your scholarship, sweetie. What's the contest? Actually, it's a contest that brings together... Hide. It should be ok now. We'll talk about it later. Off you go. You can't stay here. Let's go. Bravo! They picked my little nightingale! My little nightingale will be on TV! Who told you? Small island, big ears... Grandma... Be proud. You honour the spirits of our ancestors. Ok, but I'd rather not tell Mum. To surprise her. You're right. Next one. Over here. Why do that? They're bewitched. No eggs for ten days now. Not one! I told the ancestors about you, birdy. - You did? - They say you have a destiny. A great destiny. Did you tell Mum? She's a mother. She worries about your future. It's normal, nightingale. Grandma... Tell her. It's not that easy. Working hard wears her out. She forgets the ancestors. She's deaf to their words. Shall we make dinner? Let's go. Tip it all in. There. Good. Can you get the saffron? Is it cos of Grandpa? For her, I don't sing as well? Don't be silly, birdy. One day, you know, you'll have to feed us. It's a responsibility. Your mum wants you to be up to it. The ancestors said, "You are because we are." All alone, you don't exist. But... it's what I want to do. But you can't till, sow, harvest and eat the same day, birdy! Be patient. Your mum can't always fight against destiny. - What if the spirits are wrong? - Stop it! Don't doubt like your mother. Not in them. The power of destiny, birdy. The power of destiny. Go on, sing a bit for Grandma. Talked to the record company? Do I have to come back? Hi, how are you? - Ok? - Yes. - Sure? - I said yes! You don't seem it. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello. What do you say? It'll clear your debts and you can retire. You won't get a better offer. I agree. You agree? I've always agreed, but I don't want this offer or another. My hotel isn't for sale. Mr Lepetit, be reasonable. You saw your neighbours. Come in! Come in, Ella. You're not disturbing us. - Everything ok? - Yes, thank you. How's your mother? Laly's always well. It was something when she worked here. You know how she met your dad? You could say you're here now thanks to me, in a way. How old is Nelson now? Eight? Nine? - Eleven. - Eleven? Time flies, it's crazy. About time, mine's precious. Yes, sorry. Goodbye, Mr... Rajani Mohandas Karamchand. Exactly. Have a good day. - Goodbye. - Namaste. You saved me. Without you, I... What was it you wanted? I wanted to ask for extra hours. There's plenty of work. The trouble is... I understand. No news of Nelson's scholarship? I'll make a few calls. No, sir, no preferential treatment. I'll just check they have his file. Careful, sir. If I hear you stepped in... - Sorry. Have a good day. - Goodbye. Just a second. Here. An advance. I can't do more. Thank you very much. However... Nelson can't come and go. Of course. We have four stars, five soon, I hope. We have a reputation. I understand. Have a good day. Here you go. Would you like a parasol? No go on the covers album. Mr Leroy! Are you ok? - There. - He's back. In an hour, he'll be good as new. Laly, you saved me, as usual. I'll have to come back. It's a big job. Wait... Patrice, have her driven home. Thank you, Laly. Mr Leroy, you gave us quite a fright. What's that? It's incense. No, that lady. Laly. Amazing, isn't she? What happened? I collapsed? Just a little. - And you called... - A healer. She's famous, they come a long way to consult her. Personally, last year, she saved me from terrible piles. I was in total agony. I couldn't... Tell me why. That's easy. Coffee, pepper and alcohol, that's the result. No, why not call a real doctor? A doctor... He'd have hospitalized you for tests. With your luck, you'd have caught one of those viruses going around. And you wouldn't have sung tonight. Mr Lepetit, you'd risk my life for... Very petty, Mr Lepetit. I'll be going. Try to rest. I don't know you... I don't know you... Night, Mum. Night, sweetheart. My dear friends, I'm delighted to see so many of you here for a very special show. And a very special show means... It's us. Are we late? You're not singers. You're comedians. Get out! But you told us we could come and... In the shower, we sing I Don't Know You. - Drop it. Let's go. - Wait. You must be unhappy to be so mean! When Nelson's a star, don't come begging for a duet. Yeah, Mr Leroy. When he makes it, you'll hit yourself with your crap concerts! Kick. Kick yourself too! Right, Johnson... Want a duet? What'll it be? Let's go. Scared? - He's kidding. - Is it true? Your protégé seems scared. To accompany him, another celebrity, a local one, Mr Jeff, our dentist musician. Give him a big hand. You're getting impatient. Ready? Let's hear it for Mr Pierre Leroy! Thank you, sir, your support is heart-warming. First, meet a young talent... Go on. Spotlight. Here he is. Don't be afraid. Come on, kid. We won't bite. Here we are. So, what'll you sing? Want to do a duet? He's shy. Let's encourage him. Johnson! Nelson! There you go. - Nelson, come back. - Not Johnson, Nelson. Same difference. He's gone. I'll sing then. I'll do a song on men's cowardice. As the writer said, it's the story of a loser. Jeff... That did you good. I gave him his chance, right? What are you thinking? This job won't do him good. Look at me. You're very self-centred. You can talk. You nearly let me die to save your show. I'm not proud, but you exaggerate. You turn a dizzy spell into a heart attack. You came to reconnect, not to shatter a kid's illusions. I did him a favour. Looking at you, one may not be happier with lost illusions. That's beautiful. I'd steal it for a song, but I don't write now. If you wish to pull out, I'd understand. Good night, Mr Leroy. Morning. - Your taxi, Mr Leroy. - Thank you. Sorry, Mr Leroy. Mr Leroy? I was waiting for you. I ordered a taxi. What's that? "A lonely man can be aggressive." Hubert, taxi-driver. You seem to know a lot... Know where the pepper fritter kid is? Absolutely! Ok, here we go. All right. We're here. Ten euros, please. Ten euros? Information, taxi, visit, service... It's a package. Got change? No. You'll see, it's just down there. I wait? Thanks, I can find my own way back. Here we go. I bet you stole it. Shut your mouth! - We didn't do anything. - We didn't. - Get lost! - Stop! Is this yours? Got it, guys! I found it! Yeah, sure! - What is this? - Who's the oldie? Let's split! We'll get you! We'll find you! Sure! I'll waste you! Are you ok? I'm ok. - See what happens to thieves? - We don't steal for fun. Usually, no one catches us. Not me at least. No one asked you. Sorry I bothered you. Wait! Thank you for that. Mr Leroy, Zizou has something of yours. Give him the perfume. I found it. By the way, this was with my cigars. With you, Nelson can win. You can be kind. Don't you ever give up? Don't you have a dream? Tell him. If he wins, Nelson will be a star. He'll be rich. We won't have to hide. His mum won't work and we'll live with them. No one will part us two. - She could go to school. - You too. One chance. He gets one chance. Thank you, Mr Leroy. You're a king. Present. Bye. - See you. - Bye. Sam! Be right back. Did he say anything? He didn't mention leaving? No, he just wanted a driver to visit the area. I asked Hubert. Hubert? Your wife's cousin? Didn't he lose his licence? I did wrong? No, you were right. I'm sure they'll get on well. Thank you, Sam. I thought you'd ask us in. I'm not flavour of the month with the boss. Rule N°1: You do everything I say, no questions asked. Ok, Nelson? Your agent stylist said you studied Prévert. Good. - Learn track 3 for tomorrow. - A CD? Why's he giving us a thing to scare birds? This used to play music. It still does. It has my name on it. And rule N° 2? You said "Rule N°1", so there must be another. Yes, there is. I hate lateness. Be on time. On leaving school We encountered A large railroad That led us Round the Earth In a golden wagon Round the Earth We encountered The sea at large With all its shells And its scented islands Its fine shipwrecks And smoked salmons Above the sea We encountered The moon and the stars On a sailboat Setting off for Japan... Know the song? He knows it. Right. Very good. - Run 5 laps of the promenade. - Seriously? - I don't sing? - No, you run. Can you count? - Sure. - So count. Let's go! One! He runs well. Two! Go, Nelson! Three! Two more laps! - He'll die. - He won't. Four! Last lap! And five. - He's finished? - Yes. Go on, Nelson. Sing. - What? - The Prévert song. Sing. On leaving school We encountered A large railroad - That led us... - Stop. Stand up. - Plug your nose. - What? Plug your nose. There. Say the vowels. - Zizou! - It's funny. Feel it? Feel the vibration? The column of air. That's your breath. Your voice is flesh and breath. Tomorrow, track 7 on the CD. All right. Driver, home! - Here we go. - It's over. Already? At this rate, he'll never be ready. - Zidane! - Coming. Swap Mrs Jarron and Mrs Bouix. Move her from 219 to 220. Mr Lepetit. Hello, did you sleep well? What is this? We'll see to it, Mr Leroy. "Some call it bad luck. For others, it's just life." Said someone. Here we go. It works fine. Why're we here? Today, we work on your lungs. Go on, sing. Go on, Nelson. Let Mrs Payet hear you. - Who's Mrs Payet? - My mother-in-law. Sing. Like a bird My mother-in-law... "Every sea is salty and no mother-in-law is sweet." Hunting and fishing, a bird But nothing prevents the bird From flying higher Sing louder! We can't hear. I'm alone in the world I'm scared of the sky and winter I'm scared of madmen and war I'm scared of passing time It's just water! Carry on! How can we live today In all the sound and fury I don't know anymore I'm lost Louder! Come on! Louder! Open up! Hunting and fishing, a bird But nothing prevents the bird From flying higher - Bravo! - Bravo, Nelson! "...glass and tinsel Full stop." Dash. The writer's name. "Victor Hugo". It's on the board. Heard from Nelson? He has colic. Colic? I'll read the dictation again. How I love you Like a god who is dying For love Of a queen A dagger in the heart Can't hear you! We feel no emotion! Understand what you sing? It's shit! Birdy! Can't I change? Rule N°1. Do as he says, no questions asked. Come on! Tell me a story! My life Burns up in a cry In a volcano In my madness Some nights... That's better! Tell me your story! Proud Unfaithful Unhappy Wild with joy Like you're singing to Mia. Rubbish. If you fail Star Kids, you can try Survivor! That's the way That I love you A prisoner despite myself My blood runs in your veins And I am Mad about you Perfect! Come back! Towel. Why that song? It's not great for... For a child? That what you mean? An artiste sings everything. A voice is not enough. Emotion has to come across. Why the SUP? An artiste must take the plunge. And we had a good laugh too. Today's lesson: empty your mind. Make the words yours to free your voice. Tomorrow, song number 8! Here we go. With his voice, too bad he isn't African. From a family of griots. Griots? What are griots? A musician doesn't know what a griot is? You drive a taxi and don't know what a meter is. Never seen one. But I've heard of them. I could've been a singer too. I was raised by a griot. Griots are guides, the soul of Africa. - You grew up there? - No, in Dunkirk. But you talk about... Griots, you mean? - You're not wrong. - About what? Me being African. We all are, actually. Some have just forgotten. I haven't. I can feel it. I'm a Maasai. A warrior. Do you drink? Gladly. Have you been drinking? Now? No. Why? No reason. - We'll do it again. - Any time you want. Where were you? I was worried. I'm sorry. I didn't see the time. You're on Reunion time, you say sorry... - Are you ok? - Better than ever. Let's go, they're waiting for you. The atmosphere is electric. Go ahead, I'll hold it. Sam! Sam! Unbelievable! I apologize to those who hoped to hear me sing and reassure the many others, I won't sing! Our guest is finally here. His bewitching voice will soon make you forget this minor hold-up. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Pierre Leroy! Here you go. And for you. Enjoy. What about me? See that bench? Until 10 people come, you sing. Sing on the street? Many began that way. Off you go, buddy. Ella, phone call. - For me? - Yes. - Really? - I can watch your cart. Don't worry, it won't fly off, Paul. Thanks. Thank you, Sam. Hello. Is that Mrs Tilla? Yes, speaking. Mr Joubert, Nelson's teacher. There's a bit of magic in all he does He smiles easily Even at fools He has fun, never falls into traps He isn't dazed By fairground lights Why don't they listen? He's not into it. I know, put this in front of him. Max is free Some say they've seen him fly From now on, 20 listeners and 20 euros in the cup. Why are you doing this? We'll see. He's free... Thank you. We share? No, it's cool. See that? My song worked better. Know why? You were sincere and free. Did you pay him? He refused. - 12 euros at least. - No? Look. You did good. - Think so? - Yeah. Finally. We have news to celebrate. We've had your schools' contest summons. Or is it another fake? Can you explain? No fancy lie to serve up? But, Mum... Want to tell Grandma how you lie? How you cheat? How you make your mum look stupid? You knew he altered his grades? When he still went to school. - You knew he'd skipped several days? - No. Too busy with the schools' contest? You worry too much. The spirits say he has a great destiny. A great destiny? Why bother with school if you have a destiny? Will it fund your studies? Do dunces get scholarships? I work hard, Nelson, very hard so you'll have a real job, not a destiny. Wait, Mum. For you. What's that? Don't tell me you stole it? No, I earned this money. Earned it? I sing. On the street and people pay me. You beg? He's a beggar! It's not that. Mr Leroy's coaching me and I love it. I can make my dream come true. That's the job I want. What job? What is this nonsense? I like singing too. Grandma too, like everyone. But it's not a job. Wake up. Mr Leroy says I'm talented. Stop! Cut it out. Go to your room. He isn't eating? Mum! Go to school tomorrow or don't bother coming home. You know, Ella... All right. Have a good day. Work hard. Bye, Grandma. Be careful. I didn't learn the song. Don't waste your time. It's no use. I'll tell you a story. A little girl was born poor, but she had a gift. She sang on the streets. She had a moving voice. Good for her. Someone compared her to the birds, the piafs, of Paris. They called her Piaf. Later, on stage, in her black dress, she still resembled that little girl. But, in her voice, you felt her sorrows and her torments. We all have wounds. It's good to use them. Give up if you want. It'll become a habit. I should know. I wasn't picked. I never sent the video. What did you just say? He wasn't picked? I never sent the video. You were so happy. It made you dream. I lied to make you happy. I don't believe it! I don't get it. Why do your lies make her happy? BUS STATION Can I have a ticket to the port? - Are you alone? - Yes. Two euros. Thank you. Travelling alone? What's your name? I'm Diama. And my baby is Liam. Joining your family? What is it? Something wrong? I can't do anything right. I only hurt them. Mia and Zidane will be parted cos I got scared. It's sad seeing tears on Mum's cheeks. Because of me. Things could change. She's unhappy when I sing, and I'm only happy when I sing. You're being stubborn. I'll ask you one more time. Who do I call? Listen, kid, you have no ID. You're a minor. I want to help, but talk or I'll call the police and that'll be less fun. As you want. Meet Davy. He wrote the song. Glad to meet you. - It's beautiful. - Delighted. Mr Leroy! Phone call. For me? This is incredible! I don't know you I don't know you... A fine tribute. Pierre Leroy in my prefab. Mum won't believe me. I owe you my life. I was conceived to your song. - You don't look that old. - Timeless like your song. - Go on in. - Thanks. Here he is. - He is your son? - Yes. He's black. And you're white. My father has fair hair. - And? - Mine's brown. Right... Let's go. We'll be going. Get your things. Goodbye. Thank you. Wait! There's a ransom to pay. A ransom? I need a photo or my mum will kill me! Sir, could you take a photo? The white button. All right. Curried sausage! Curried sausage. You wanted to take a boat? Ridiculous! You never stop. What came over you, Nelson? Jules Renard said, "Let sleeping grief lie." Enough of the quotes. Why didn't you send off the video? I was scared. Scared they wouldn't want me. Scared of hurting Mum if they did. Why say they picked you? To make Mia happy. To give her hope. Great job. If your mum doesn't kill you, Mia will see to it. Drive, Hubert. Here we go! I can't go back. You said she'll kill me. She doesn't love me anymore. She doesn't love you? A mother always forgives. "I Don't Care Way leads to If I'd Known Village." Not his best. Get in, birdy, we'll drop you. Thanks, I'll be ok. - Sure? - Don't worry. Here we go. I sold all my fritters. You're pissed off. HELP YOURSELF Don't take the lot! I don't know you The softness of your bed The books that you read The taste of the water you drink - Where is he? - Sorry? My son, Nelson! I dropped him at his bike. He isn't home, he missed school. It's your fault! You make him dream! You make him think it's possible! We made 7 euros more today. I have a great idea. We take photos to sell to people. Yeah? And how? With this. Zidane, I don't believe it! Not again! I'm sorry. I was useless. Well? Any news of Nelson? I called the local police chief. No accidents reported. Ella is resting. Laly gave her one of her potions. I need one too. - Don't blame yourself. - I don't. I blame him. At least I tried. We aren't all as good as you at helping others. As me? I asked about you, the hotel, your money problems. You'll be paid. I wondered why you didn't give up. Family tradition. My father built the place. It's so Ella can raise her son decently, so Sam can feed his family, and so Paul has a roof. I'm not such a philanthropist. No one acts only for themselves. You, for instance. Why do you help Nelson? Talented, sensitive, dishonest, able to hurt his nearest and dearest... Ring a bell? Solving his problems will solve yours? I think you should go home. Your mum must be worried. Don't you think? You have a family at least. And don't you miss school? I miss it. I miss everything. I'm sick of living like this. I'll work it out, promise. We'll soon have a house together. Stop, Nelson. You never keep promises. Look, we're getting nowhere. Smile! Any news? Still nothing. Sorry, we're waiting for the repair guy. No, thanks. I need to walk. May I? Do I have a choice? "With a hammer in your mind, every problem resembles a nail." If only you were a mute... I'm looking for Nelson. Seen him? I must talk to him. I know what you'll say. Your mother's in a state. She really yelled at me. When you have a test, do you learn your lesson? Of course. Life is the exact opposite. You get tested first, then you learn your lesson. You're getting a good one. Lesson at the hotel tomorrow. You'll see what a stage is. Ok, birdy, I'll take you home. Go on. Off you go. Be brave. Drive, Hubert. Here we go. I'm sorry. Sorry, I love you. I love you too. I was worried sick. I didn't want to hurt you. And I'm a bit hungry too. Come on. All right, you can go. - I'm glad you're back. - Thank you. I wanted to tell you. I knew the poem last time. I know. That's why I gave you 8 rather than 0. But... Why not give me 15 or 18 then? It's good to know what's in someone's mind, but we like to hear it too. See you tomorrow. Bye, sir. Why did he want us here? Cos we're a team. Cool, we'll use the main entrance. Maybe it's a trap to send us to the orphanage. Mr Leroy wouldn't do that. If it's a trap, run off and meet you know where. Where is I know where? Where d'you think you're going? - I'm singing with Mr Leroy. - Nice try. Are they your back-up singers? Actually, she's my agent. And he's my bodyguard. You need to imagine. - He's still in training. - Ok. Imagine yourselves gone from here! Really, Paul! You block loyal customers now? It's unworthy of our reputation. Forgive him, he didn't know. We didn't expect you so early. Follow me, please. See, I told you. But there's no red carpet. Sam, could I have the key to these guests' room? Room 7. Thank you. Here you are, miss. Go on. It's not bad here. Hello, reception? Could you send up champagne, chocolate and ice cream? Stop touching stuff. Beautiful, huh? - Let's try it. - Really? Didn't you want to do a duet? Right now? It's perfect. Comfy? This place is awesome. Why are you doing this? - I hope it's not a trap. - Don't worry. It isn't. No one will part you. Finding a foster family takes time. Nelson can't save you, nor can you. So accept a little help. All right? Come here. Try your mic. Guys, coming? Just a sec. There. Ready? Let's go. Three, four. Nelson and his band. Over to you. When I look at the sea I imagine them all Landing so poor Hoping beyond hope When I look at the sky I see my children My loved ones When I look around I see others standing like me The same My home Mr Lepetit! The truck's here. The driver needs help. There where I go You're with me My home You're in my heart here My home In my dreams you live on My home What about the truck? The truck. To unload it. See Sam about it! Come with me. I didn't expect it, but... you did pretty well. For an old guy? You handled those nerves you don't have really well. I'll tell you a secret. You'll never get over nerves. Really? Never? Never. They stifle you, but drive you on. If you lose them, it means you're dead. Dead? As a performer. I don't get it. For the audition... It isn't too late? We'll try. It's great, all you're doing for me. But I can't. Not if it hurts Mum. Shall I talk to her? That's my job. But I'll need you. Sam, have you seen Hubert? There he is. I can sense it. It's working now. Big surprise, huh? Not at all. "Destiny often awaits on paths taken to avoid it." - La Fontaine. - Beautiful. - I have a task for you. - When? Now. Here we go. Let me tell you first. Right. I'll start on the piano. The intro... - Can I ask you something? - Of course. Why come and sing here? 10,000 km away, it's less tough if the person you love most doesn't come to see you. The girl in the photo? I needed to take a step back, to find fresh inspiration. Why won't she see you if you love her? I wasn't there much when she needed a dad. Can I ask one more thing? Your lessons for Nelson, they're a sham, right? They're like the feather for Dumbo. The feather for Dumbo? The feather helps him fly. It gives him the courage to. It's different. It's ringing. I sent Hubert. No answer. Hello. Ella? Yes, speaking. Hello, it's Mr Lepetit. Sorry to bother you on your day off. The other day, you asked to do extra hours... Here's the thing... We have a group of Italians who arrived unannounced. Get her to wear a pretty dress. I'm sorry. As I was saying, a group of Italians has arrived and we need reinforcements. For housework? More as receptionist. So put on your prettiest dress... A pretty dress, ok. But I don't speak Italian. Great, you'll be able to learn. I'm on my way. On your way? Well, that's perfect. I'll send Hubert as soon as I can. - He's here. - Already? He's already there? Great. We'll be expecting you. See you soon. Your kid's quite a character. You look good dressed. In a pretty dress. Not ideal for housework. "If a woman is badly dressed, you notice her dress. But if she's perfectly dressed, you notice her." Coco Chanel. Try noticing the road. Don't worry, I know these roads by heart. Pierre, shouldn't my mum be here? Why isn't she here? You have to factor in Hubert. Zidane... What are you doing now? Making fritters. There'll be a crowd. It's a perfect opportunity. Everyone's waiting for you for the party. Why're you here? Later. Hurry! Mum, can you tell me what's going on? There. Finally! Come on. Good evening. Hello, Ella. You're here at last. Sit down. Come on. Just wait and see what they can do. - Who? - The spirits, of course. Dear friends and audience, thank you for coming. What a song and dance! Well? Welcome to the Lagoon Voice. Shortly, we'll have our Star Kid. Nelson's going to sing. First of all, our jury. A four-star jury, of course. First, I'd like a big hand for our master singer, writer and performer of I Don't Know You, Mr Pierre Leroy! Here we go. Rightly known as the Incorruptible, Mr Paul! Gentleness in person and an exceptional cook, the delicate Victoire Bengué! - Go, Victoire! - Thank you. And, finally, our 5-star juror, unyielding and beautiful, the majestic Ella! That's you! Come on. What? My mum's on the jury? Pierre's idea. To see if she agrees. Know what? The nerves I don't get are here. That's good. And now it's time to welcome our first contestant. I call contestant N° 1! Go on! Give him a big hand. He said contestant N°1. Is there a N°2? Yes, you! Very funny. Come on. The mic is ready. My fritters! I won't wish you luck as that's not done, so... Music! Go on. Nice and slow. Calmly. Breathe. Sing Everything's fine. Don't worry. I don't believe it! Sorry. It's nothing. Damien! Come here! Sing. Sing To forget your sorrows To cradle a child Sing To say I love you But sing all the time Light the box, not me! Shall I try it? Son of a bitch! Rediscover the essential And do Forgive me... I don't know your mother. Atop the barricades Feet and wrists bound Beneath the gunfire Here goes... Thank you. A new day has dawned We can gaze at it in wonder Sing ever louder despite everything All I can do is sing And unite our voices Around an intoxicating wine Sing of someone who leaves To go on living All I can do is sing For someone who leaves To go on living Sing Of one who enters the world Love him Teach him nothing but love By forming a single circle Sing over and over A new day has dawned We can gaze at it in wonder Sing ever louder despite everything All I can do is sing And unite our voices Around an intoxicating wine Sing of someone who leaves To go on living All I can do is sing For someone who leaves To go on living Forgive me. That was beautiful. I'm so proud of my little bird. You knew? A mum knows everything. But go to school too. No more lies. Promise. On stage now. Let's sing. Come on, Mum.
