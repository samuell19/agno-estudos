I abandoned a lot of hearts back there. I got word that all my queens were lost. So what, I went to Magadan. We're even! There I saw the Bay of Nogaiisk and the dirt roads. I didn't go there out of the blue! V. Vysotsky SOVIETS PLUS ELECTRICITY A cinetrip by Nicolas Rey REEL #3: Yakutsk, Magadan. When things get dicey although it's far and expensive, I can go see a friend in Magadan. It's okay! You have not seen the Bay of Nogaiisk, you fool! I didn't go there out of the blue. Tomorrow is September 13th. A month after Friday the 13th, when I was in Chernobyl. Maybe it was to put an end to romanticism that I decided to leave for the end of the world. The incredible thing is that I convinced people to help me, and I should thank them, incidentally. In the end, I didn't have much to do. Just get myself here, just be in one place, and say I want to go to another one, and off I went. Without even having to decide when to leave. It just happened. And I don't want to complain, but I'm still a little surprised. If I hadn't stalled for time, I'd already be on my way. 10:30. Volodia went to get changed after checking the tires and, as it's the season, loading the potatoes that are also part of our payload, and taking care of minor technical details. Then I was immediately put on spud duty for the soup. The morning soup, at 8 a.m. Potatoes, carrots, a little... a half tin of meat thrown in. That's all. Some tea. The oil heater. Volodia went bare-chested to wash up in the river. 2 p.m. We've been on the road since this morning. Since this morning's soup. We stopped once to visit a friend of Volodia's, Kolya, who lives in an isolated shed. Two or three cows, a horse or two, and the river downhill supplying its daily ration of fish. The world's cleanest river, as he put it. He's 59 years old. And 37 of them he spent "sitting" as they say in Russian and as he frankly admits. The last 10 years not far away from here in a prison near Yakutsk. He doesn't want to go anywhere anymore. Now he's staying put. He's had a girlfriend for some time and a five-month-old daughter. But his girlfriend wants to leave here. So he will keep the child and in two years' time, when she's two he will travel, go see his homeland, Western Ukraine, near the border, just behind the Carpathians. Funny, that's also where Volodia comes from. All the way across. They went from one end... from one extreme to the other. "But," he said, "Volodia is a city dweller." He himself comes from the mountains. He's a real "Mujik". Maybe one day I'll come back to film more of him. Quite a character. And he told us that people he knew had left yesterday... Acquaintances that were going toward Magadan. Maybe we would catch up with them. At the rate we're going, I doubt it. But we know what their truck looks like. We know where they could have stopped. We'll see. We just stopped in a village but since Volodia isn't very... How should I put it? ...isn't very talkative, I don't know why we're here. He asked directions to this house. I don't think this village is where that truck could be. Unless it left, because it's a yellow truck and there's no yellow truck around. There's a blue one, but no yellow ones. It's pretty here. I forgot what the name was. "Yukutche" or something like that. I remember discussions around the table at Christmas. How we used to quarrel about politics. Now, we're a gang of consumers. They're in the house. I'm waiting outside. I like it better that way. Especially since I know that it takes special authorization to come here in the boondocks. Probably because of the large number of gold mines in the area. I'm only gathering pebbles. I'm avoiding the yellow ones. 1 9 1 6: On the whole, capitalism is growing far more rapidly than before, but this growth is not only becoming more and more uneven, We'll be arriving at Tomtor. - its unevenness also manifests itself in the decay of the countries which are richest in capital. We'll go deliver the fuel. Volodia said he has a friend there. His friend's wife is a "businesswoman" and she goes to Magadan from time to time. Maybe that is how I'll go down the other side of the mountain. Then we'll be about half-way between Yakutsk and Magadan. At the point of no return, so to speak. Volodia told me earlier that today is Friday. I was shocked. That means... I should really look at a calendar... one of these days. I took it upon myself to ask Volodia to play the Vysotsky tape he had played the first day. Whereas I used to let him play whatever he wanted. No sooner had I put the tape in did he notice a problem with one of the wheels. A flat tire. Not only that, oil was leaking from the engine. We've been stopped for five hours. Had to fix everything. It looks like we'll be spending the night here because it's already 11 p.m. A trucker's life. Well, it's now 6 o'clock. Volodia finally came back. We had soup together. But I didn't eat. And then he drove me back to Tomtor, where I am now, in the hotel. The four-room hotel in Tomtor. Four rooms and not four stars... The receptionist isn't in. There's a sort of substitute. Not a very friendly guy. No sign of... that van which is leaving tomorrow for Ust-Nera. The guy says someone here is leaving tomorrow for Ust-Nera. I should wait for the lady in charge of reception. I asked him if there was a store nearby. Because we ate my last tin of sardines with Volodia just before. Just before I threw up. And now my supply bag has never been emptier. When Volodia was here, the guy would talk to me but since he left, he's been staring at the TV set with his head in his hands. He refused to answer when I talked to him and asked him where there was a shop. A quick glance and bang! Back to watching TV. As we say in French: "Talk... Talk to my ass, my head is not doing so well." Whereas it's my head that hurts but it's him... But eventually, the silly program he was watching came to an end. Some local variety show. So I went out into the vestibule... the typical Siberian vestibule and I heard him leave the reception booth. He probably thought I had gone to look for the shop by myself. So I came back in and in the corridor he had no choice but to talk to me. First he said there were no stores. There was one in the center of Tomtor, but not around here. And anyway it was closed on Saturdays. Then, after a little chat, asking me where I came from and so on, he told me there was one "maybe a little further down the road". So I went "maybe a little further down the road". And it was closed. So I dread asking him if there's a restaurant. In this place! All's well that ends well. In order to move the bed the "diejurnaia" had prepared for me into a room that she hadn't lost the key to we asked this young fellow for help and he turned out to be that driver we met this morning. The one who was sleeping hidden under his blanket in room #4. I wouldn't have recognized him but since he wasn't surprised when I asked him if he could take me to Kanditcha, I knew it was him. He told me we were leaving early in the morning. I asked him what time but he didn't answer. I asked if he could wake me up and he said yes. But he didn't seem very happy about it. So I set my alarm clock for 5 a.m. And since I went to bed at 7 p.m., it wasn't hard to get up. I noticed that he was still asleep. So I went back to bed myself. Around 5:45 I heard some noise: a car was coming. I got up. And in the shower, I waited. Whereas in France, you have to wait for the cold water between the shower head and the heater to run off in order to enjoy the comfort of heated water, here, being the first person in town to take a hot shower, you have to wait for hot water to come from the plant. Just as it was finally reasonably warm the driver knocked on the door yelling: "Let's go!" So I jumped into my dirty trousers and here we are in that UAZ van driving to the sound first of Julio Iglesias and now to some more local music. After three days in an overloaded truck I feel as if I were in a rocket doing 50 km/h on the trail going down or rather going up the Indigarka valley. 950 km to Magadan according to the milestones. Dinner time. I probably gave Volodia or someone else my fork. No problem, only I don't have another one. It's going to be tricky eating Chinese noodles with my fingers. Anyway, we'll manage. I asked the "diejurnaia" if there was anyone in the hotel going to Magadan. As usual, first she said she didn't know but then she said: "Oh yeah, the policeman next door to you. He asked me to wake him up at 7 a.m. He's going to Magadan tomorrow." I don't feel like traveling with a policeman. An old instinct. Can't help it. I'd rather stay here tomorrow morning and film. I hope I can find someone driving to Susuman a hundred kilometers down the road. I learned the names of the villages on the way. It's easy: "Bolshevik", "Kholodny" which means "cold" and gives an idea of the climate here. The third one is harder: "Neksikan". Like "Mexican", only "Neksikan". I guess I'll have to thumb it after all. Ah! Tea's ready. Maybe you can hear it in the background. Time to eat. Oh! My sardines and ham come from Saint Petersburg! Although we're ten times closer to the Pacific than to the Baltic Sea. I suppose it's possible there are no sardines in the Sea of Okhotsk. But pigs should grow around here. I even know where: in room 202B. Here's what happened: on my way to the bathroom I ran into those policemen. Of course... And naturally they started asking me where I'm from... If I was thirsty... So I pulled out the old bad liver excuse. I didn't feel like drinking. But it was okay. We had a little chat. Actually, we might meet again tomorrow because they're also taking the 3 p.m. bus from Susuman. They're hitch-hiking to Susuman as well. Only it's easier for them to stop a car. So they said. Oh well. They sang a little song for me. I didn't record it. Too bad. I didn't have the tape recorder with me. I was born around the time when Khruschev was deposed and I became old enough to vote when Gorbachev came into power. - So tomorrow I'll take a few shots and then go catch that bus in Susuman. I guess I'm part of the Brezhnev generation. Here, even the ravens are silent. It stopped! It was the garbage truck. It's great because he took the shortcut to the road avoiding the police checkpoint taking me straight to the bridge. Now I just have to wait. Oh! My pants are full of dung! Not too good for hitch-hiking. My first time ever in this time zone. My first time ever in this time zone. 1 920: And I feel kind of alone... - Marxist theory has proved, and this is confirmed by the experience of all European revolutionary movements, that the private owner, the smallholder, who, under capitalism, very frequently suffers a most acute and rapid deterioration in his conditions of life, and even ruin, easily goes to revolutionary extremes, but is incapable of perseverance, discipline and steadfastness. 1 920: The petit-bourgeois driven crazy - Oh! A green car coming up... by the horrors of capitalism is, like anarchism, a phenomenon typical of capitalism. - No, blue. And a blue truck. The instability of such revolutionism, its barrenness, This is my blue period. Here I am trying to look sharp. its tendency to turn into submission, apathy, phantasms, or even a wild infatuation with one bourgeois fad or another, all this is common knowledge. Blue, though light blue. There are only six cars going in circles in this place. There's... the garbage truck. There's... the water pipe repair truck. There's the police. There's a jeep marked "Telegraf"... no idea what it's doing. There's a mysterious small blue van and a Toyota with tinted windows. As for the other possibilities: I dismissed the coal truck, the delivery truck dismissed me, and the other businessmen... No thanks. Magadan, Magadan. 7 a.m. The sun isn't up yet. It's kind of cold. Long time since I've seen a real city. And traffic lights. Though they're only blinking orange at this hour. Soldiers are on duty in front of the bus station. "Magadan Hotel", "Magadan Restaurant", "Magadan" bus station, "Magadan" bus. Maybe I'll call France and tell them I'm finally here. It's 8 p.m. back there. Yesterday. So... I was looking for the post office to see if it was open, and make my call. I was rounding the corner of Lenin Street... Ah! I have to interrupt this live broadcast! So I have to tell you this story while the immersion heater remedies the lack of hot water. They gave me a bucket and an immersion heater to get washed. I guess I must have looked like someone who's been doing a little too much traveling. So I was looking for the post office so I could make my phone call and as I was turning the corner of Lenin Street... There he was. But he didn't give a damn. He was looking the other way. Into the morning fog. Just then, a squad of policemen escorting a drunk woman came out of the building across from the "Magadan Hotel", behind the bus station that turned out to be... that turned out... Behind the building opposite the "Magadan Hotel", near the Lenin monument, behind the bus station, that turned out to be the police headquarters. Oh well. I have to admit I was not unnoticeable with my three bags and my mug looking as if... How should I put it? Well. Anyway. Anyway, they arrested me of course, and they asked me where I came from... My passport, my visa... They started thinking I had been on Russian soil for two years because I had a visa from two years ago. And when I explained that I came by bus, that I hadn't flown in from Paris, they had a hard time believing me. That I had come by road from Yakutsk... So I ended up in the back of their car for a little routine check. Only instead of taking me in to headquarters, where we were, they started joking around and saying they would take me for a short tour of the city. And we landed somewhere in the industrial harbor. And there... There, they stopped the car, got out, took out a bottle of vodka that had already been tapped into, as I had noticed. And they asked me if I was in for a drink. So I tried the classic bad liver trick. The funny thing is that I learned the word for liver, "petchen", because I bought a tin of cod liver. I thought it was cod but it was cod liver. That's how I learned the word for liver. A very useful word, proving that there's a very fine line between cod-liver oil and preventing alcoholism. So, at that point they got out of the car... Strangely, they grabbed a machine gun, one of them started putting on a pair of gloves... Gloves for doing the dishes, yellow rubber gloves... The bottle of vodka... There was a brief dubious moment. Then it seems they were called over the radio to go somewhere else and we drove like mad across town. As soon as they got there, they were called to headquarters. A screeching U-turn and back to headquarters. There, in the headquarters, I met their boss and things worked out. He was very nice. I just need to have my visa registered. So he called the Director of the Visa Office for me, where I had to go. Then they actually took me there to get it registered. But the office was still closed, it was too early. So they took me to the hotel, the "Magadan Hotel", across the street from where they had nabbed me, and they turned me in to the "diejurnaia". So now I'm in my room with a view of Magadan. I can see another hotel. Maybe they have hot water. Probably not, because it's usually supplied to the whole neighborhood or city. So that was my introduction to Magadan. And the funny thing is, when I explained I had come in short steps, "po etapam" as I said in Russian, they told me that the term was specific to deportees. "Po etapam" is the way they were transferred from one prison to another all the way to Siberia. So I said: "So, here I am." I forgot to say something. When they took me to the industrial harbor they said: "See, this is the beautiful bay facing the city." And I couldn't help replying: "Sure: the Bay of Nagaievo." So they looked at me and went: "I thought it was your first time here." So I said: "It is, but there's a famous song by Vysotsky: You haven't seen the Bay of Nogaiisk, etc." So they said: "Okay. Fine. Whatever." And so it was that after a bathroom scene, which was burlesque yet comforting, and sporting his least soiled shirt, he stepped out into the brisk sea air. This film was shot in August and September 1999. Martine Cornet read the excerpts from: "Imperialism, The Highest Stage of Capitalism" and "Left-Wing Communism: an Infantile Disorder" by Lenin, written in 1916 in Zurich, and in April 1920, back in Russia. "Soviets Plus Electricity" was self-produced and the work print was made with the technical means of L'Abominable, a cooperative film lab in Paris. Thanks to the support from the French Ministry of Culture an optical sound print could be made by the Cinédia laboratory. Translation by P. Chodorov / N. Rey Subtitling by SUBS Hamburg
