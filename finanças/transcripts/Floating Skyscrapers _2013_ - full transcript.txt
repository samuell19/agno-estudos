FLOATING SKYSCRAPERS You waited... Did you wait long? I'm going here just for you. What do I have to say to them? I don't know, honey. Talk about the weather or something. Excuse me, are you smoking a joint? I'm Michal. Kuba. Give me a puff. OK, quick, one more. I'm going. It's too wild. The guy runs away and climbs up a tree. The other throws a stone at him. The first falls and does not move. And then, okay, he gets up and leaves. It's madness. This is the kind of film I like. - Does he kill him or what? - I can't tell you. Go see the movie, you'll find out. He kills him. No... let it be a surprise... It was great, and the way it was filmed... amazing... Take me home. Right Now? Just like that? Let's go see something... Good idea... I have a projector. We can try that... Can we... Fuck. What? I can't sleep. It's the heat. - What are you watching? - A film. You're not going to sleep? How was it today in training? Don't worry, everything will be fine. Someone may be better... Bullshit. You want to watch with me? Is it good? What? The film. Can you turn up the volume? How much longer? 3 minutes. 3 minutes, OK? don't talk to me like that. Or... Be careful what you say. Or... How can you? This is completely stupid. Sylwia, for heaven's sake! Or... We relax. You're going to talk to him? Water is expensive. I try to save. A girl of her age, squatting with people... She can't return to her mother. - She at least doing something. - I have to live with it. I too would like to do many things. I will not take dependents. It is paid each month. What's your problem? Train, Travel... Do what you want. At your age, I did not have these opportunities. Where did you get those shoes? I bought them. With what money? What do you think? I borrowed it. From her? - I will not pay back your debts. - You want to leave? No, not you. Come on guys, faster. No, no... Table three wants wine or something... - Pepper, please. - Right away. - What happened to my drink? - What did you order? - Chardonnay, Chile. - Sorry, I'll bring it to you. I waited for 10 minutes. - What if she comes in without knocking? - She will not. - And if she does? - She will have a lot to tell. Kuba. - Kuba. You hear me? - She's calling you. Kuba! Great. Just like that. - Will you watch a movie with me? - What? An American film on the 2... I know. The column towards the shoulders. You lick my ass? It's so bad there, down the back. You lick me? So? Answer. Come on, answer. You'll be sorry. Hello? Who is it? Who? Oh, hi. Who is it? It's okay? - You can't wait until tomorrow? - He needs it today. He can't come here? Huh? He can't? You are stupid. Kuba, don't leave me here alone. Watch a movie with Ewa. It's funny that thing there. Has it been a long time with Sylwia? Two years. That's long. - You think? - Yes, man. Two years! And you? What? With Sylwia? Come here. What? You get higher this way. You maintain your results, and you're qualified. - No problem. - I'm serious. No shit, concentrate. This is your chance. Otherwise, it's Piotrek which takes the place. Do you understand? Come on! - So? - Damn, amazing! Let me see. All right, I got nothing. A banana? My God, I'm wiped out! Why don't you go home? I'll go... Go ahead! What happened? Nothing. - You OK? - Fine. Who loves you? You. - Very refined. - You'll be surprised. So... What's up? It's Sylwia. My mother works the night shift. - Michal, you want a Coke? - No, thank you. And you, Kuba? You've been here for 30 minutes. - How do you know? - Why don't you go up? - He's there? - You mean Dad. Is he here? Yes. - What's his name? - Who? Stop. Don't be stupid, I know. Kuba. Jacob? Nice. - It's nice? - Beautiful. I'm sure. You think I can talk to Dad? Grandma called. She wants you to come with me. What do you think about that? She would be delighted. You could take Julka. She likes him. I have not seen her since graduation. You should call. Ask how she is. - Shall we? - Come on, I'm coming. - Are you sure? - Yes I Am. This is your last chance. One of you will be chosen. You must give the best of yourself. And don't forget: you win with your head. OK? Not with your muscles, with your head. Relax. Good luck. don't waste your chance... ...or the time we spent here the last two years. Can you explain this? Come on, tell me? You're there for years. I break my ass for you. You want to fuck it all up? Don't you sit down. You could have become a champion. You lack balls! Kuba! Kuba! What are you doing here? - Huh? - Kiss my ass. Come on let piss off. Fucking fag. [Hi, I like you!] [Will you come with me?] - You have to go right? - You don't like it? Either way, you will not go there. What do you know? Don't drink out of the bottle. Get a glass. [The thunderbolt.] Watch you behavior? I'm speaking to you! This has to change. What? - Your attitude. - I don't have an attitude. - You train for 15 years. - So what? You want to drop everything? - Have you talked to her? - To whom? - Sylwia. - No, and I will not do it. - Then I will. - No, you will not. Want to bet? When I lived at home, it was fine. Now it's all problems. - It is you who wanted this. - You let me do. I explained to you... You chose, not me. And now look what you got. [M. Tanaka was divorced last year.] [Now he pays] [support.] You saw the game, Dad? 3-0, nice. They played well. Mom... You could see it would not work. They were weak in defense. - In attack, for that matter. - Especially Wasilewski. Mom? Without it, they could have something. - Fighting to the end... - Are you nervous? What's up? I should tell you something. - You get divorced? - I did not. - So what? - I'm gay. Why are her cheeks so red? It's an allergy. - Have you seen a doctor? - We see him Friday. It is a milk allergy. Stop giving it to him. When do you go to training? End of August. We would also like to go to Italy. To Rome this time. Why did Dad not say anything? This boy, this Kuba... - You talk about him a lot. - Because I'm happy. You like him? Yes I do. - If you need... - Mom... Promise me if you need something, you come to see me. You want to meet him? Not yet. Let's go. Stop fidgeting or I'll go crazy. What are you doing? - I'm sending a text message. - To whom? Happy? Send it and let me sleep. I waited at the pool. - Relax, it was just fun. - I'm sick of fucking fun. Watch it. Kuba? What's up? What happened? How so? What matters for you. Is this because of the training? don't worry, you will qualify next season. What I said... I did not mean that. I love you. Go to sleep. Kuba, what the fuck. Have you got any cigarettes? No, we'll get some tomorrow. What are you doing? I'm going to the quick mart. You want something? Coke Zero. Where are you? Some friends invited me to a party. I had to change my mind. - Where? - You're jealous ? Michal... What do you want? What is it? Kiss him for me. Przemek, please get out. Sorry, Przemek is a little drunk. Are you there? You told her? Only him, I promise you. Sylwia is waiting. I have to go. - I'll call you tomorrow then ? - OK . Thank you. What about you? You don't want to? When you you old, you get three lines here. I love you, you know. You do, I tell you. Three. Two. What are you doing today? - Why? - No reason. I'm just asking. I thought of school studies again. Normal stuff like social work or marketing. Really? You and marketing? Michal was talking about college. Tell me that you love me. Tell me that you love me. What? I have to pee. Do you use protection? Mom, please. Did you get the tests for HIV? Yes I did. - Bravo. - These are normal questions. Where is Monika? Why didn't you call me? None of you will come? I don't know what to tell you. I don't know. Yeah. OK. Bye. You remember the evening we met? Yeah. Kuba said he fell in love with me. Why are you telling me? I think I should thank you. You want to sleep with him? - I don't. - So what? Come on, the water is good. What you got there? I can't believe it. Kuba, come see this! - What? - He has a hickey. A date with an ex? It must have been great. C'mon Kuba, come see it! Will you get me the toothbrush? Here. Move to the couch, swim in the pool. Exactly. I never thought I'd meet someone like you. What does that mean? - And now? - Now that I have you? Well, what do you have? I do not know, you tell me. What do you want? Don't screw up everything. I adore you, man. Boner me. Kuba? - He's not here. - Where is he? I don't know. - What are you doing in there? - I'm getting out now. Come see me. We need to talk. - You hear me? - One minute, okay? Do you like it? Help me. She wants me to move out. This is her place after all. When Kuba lived with me, it did not bother her. That was different. She was with a guy who he hates. But somehow she did not mind. What a whore! - You want keep an eye on it all the time? - I don't. - Then what is it? - That's what I'm wondering. He's gay, Sylwia. I tested everything of which I have spoken to you. And? I'm too pale. I look like an idiot. I like your pallor. I love him. Yes? Where are you? You laugh. What? He coming with Michal? Strong arms. If a guy has powerful arms, it's all you need. - Sure. - Yeah. Legs. - Hairy and muscular. - There you go. Crooked legs. - It's cool bowlegged. - Yeah. All footballers have that. It's okay? A puff? - You're going to start training? - I don't know yet. We'll see. Come here. - What? - Closer. You're beautiful. Damn, it's beautiful. Give me that. Have you fucked? Huh? And did he fuck you? You kissed him? You've kissed? It was insane, right? Who is it? - Michal, my... - Your what? It's my fault. - You can't do this to me. - To you? You can't do this to me. I love you. - Sylwia, we need to talk. - No, it is we who need to talk. Sit down. Come on. What? She is pregnant. - With who? - Not me. Stop messing around. I'm finished playing. We must consider the baby now. Initially, you can stay here. Sylwia will find you a job at the restaurant. Then you can go back to training. We will work it out. Why are you looking at me? I have 330 euros per month. I'll have a half time more... - Why you looking at me? - I'm not. I will not do that. You're going to do it. You will. This is not a proposal. And you never see him again. Hi. Quiet. Not yet. I can't. I don't want to see you. That has nothing to do with it. I can do nothing. I have told you. I can't see you. No, don't come. Good. What? When you were a kid you climbed on the window sill. - You saw the skyscrapers. - Dad, please. You kept your eyes open until the tears started. The lights of buildings blurred, and you said they floated. When we lived in Bemowo, your mother returned from work, and saw you in the window. You put a tape in there. Do you remember? You were standing in the doorway and you gave a show for the kids in the yard. I remember being punished for it. You know I'm not going to change? - Hi. - What happened to you?
