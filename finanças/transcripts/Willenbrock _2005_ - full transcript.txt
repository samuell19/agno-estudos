Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. I'm not a man of big words, you know. I grew up in a small town where everyone always felt offended. My brother, my mother, my teachers... The entire town always felt insulted because they didn?t get what they wanted. But I only laughed. Whenever someone tripped me, I laughed. But I finally got what I wanted... ... a successful business, my own house, a beautiful wife and lots of fun, if you know what I mean. Good morning, everyone! - Morning! So, who's first? You, Mr. Friedrich? Decided yet? - My wife has a question about the catalytic converter. Have your wife talk to Jurek. He can deal with complicated mechanisms. How can I help you? - I' m here because of the job offer. Job offer? - Mr. Willenbrock, the star is missing! - Take it easy. I' m at work and not on the run! I know you want a younger guy, but ... - Sorry, I already have somebody. I thought so. - Since yesterday. What a shame. But I thought I'd try. - There's nothing I can do. Let's go, Anna. - Yeah, come on. Look s good ... your dog, I mean. - I trained him myself. Got a gun? - The last time I held a gun was in the army. That was enough. - I know what you mean. But two weeks ago, somebody stole five cars from the lot. So my insurance was cancelled. But otherwise, not much happens. He already has somebody. Just a second. - Too bad. Come to think of it, the other applicant didn?t't have a dog. My father can't sleep at night. He'd be the perfect night watch man. Anna ... - Well, if you have your heart set on it ... Stop by tomorrow at 8 PM, okay? What about you? Do you like that Alfa Romeo? It's too expensive. Everything has its price. Professor! - What's going on? I' m glad you could come. Coffee for the lady, please! You look good with short hair. Makes you look 10 years younger. So what's up? Is your company going bankrupt? I wanted to see you again. - So you interrupted my lecture? You really are crazy. - Crazy about you, Vera. Shut your eyes! You gave me that last time, Bernd. I' m amazed you remember ... Come to think of it, when did I last hear from you? I don't know ... three months? A quarter year, tops. Okay, I' ll finish my coffee, and then I' ll leave again. That's all I was hoping for. Two champagnes, please! 15 minutes was over long ago. I had some difficult negotiations. I' ll be right with you ... Yes. Yes, see you. Bye. Bye. You actually love her? Sure. Is everything okay? Yes. Dinner's ready. Just a minute. I've got to finish this first. How much do you need this month? Come on. Tell me. You can give it back to me as soon as your business gets going. It's so humiliating not to be able to support myself, at my age. Come on, men used to kill for their wives. Nowadays they only give them money. That's what I call humiliating. Is 5000 enough? Oh look! Bought you this. Been carrying it around for ages. But it's already open. - Well, I thought it had leaked. I smelled something in my car, so I had a look. I could have exchanged it, but ... Thank you. Sweet of you. Don't you want to try it out? I think this would be a good spot. Oh shit, what the fuck is this? Go on. 2800, 2900, 3000. I don't want to know what your profit margin is. - I suggest ... we forget about the contract, and I' II give you 500 more. Then you' ll earn even more. Only one of us wins in this business. And why shouldn?t that be me? I' m sure you feel the same way. I' m a painter. - All the better. I've a job for you. My showroom will need painting when it's done. I paint pictures. - Oh, really? How exciting. With oil and everything? What are they about? Death. And they sell? Nope. Then paint something different. What was your name again? You wouldn?t know it anyway. Waldersee ... Of course! Sure, I know it. You were really big once, weren?t you? Didn?t't sell that much, did you? No one remembers someone who's poor. My wife used to have an art gallery. The " Bildwerk"... Heard of it? Didn?t go that well. - Too bad. Forget it. I bought her a boutique. That's doing better. Look at the camera! Yeah. - Another one! - What? Another one! Mr. Friedrich, do you know this guy? You should. This is Mr. Waldersee, a famous painter. I' m afraid this car is reserved. Reserved? Take that one instead. It's in top shape. " Reserved" isn't a German word, is it? But it's a German notion. Where I' m from, all we know is "buy" and "pay." I' m sorry, Dr. Krylov. Does she pay well? It's more like an investment. I see. Hi there. - Hi. Willenbrock. The Alfa Romeo ... remember? Your father gave me your address. I could offer you a special deal. Is that why you came to see me? - I was just in the neighborhood. I thought you might want to take a test drive. - What? Now? I was on the way to my weekend house to shut off the water. We could combine something practical with something useful I. Would you buy a picture about death? - Depends. You saw the exhibition? I prefer the nice things in life. Death doesn't have to be gloomy. Take literature, for example ... " Hush'd on the hill is the breeze ..." Remember? - Vaguely. How does it go on? "Scarce by the Zephyr The trees are softly press'd. The wood bird?s asleep on the bough. Wait, then and thou wilt find rest. " This is it. Nice and quiet, isn't it? Come on in. It's nice here. Thank you. Say, could you take over making coffee? - Sure. Then I can bring in the flowers. Yes, I know. It's difficult lt. When he brings flowers I know. But when he gives me that look, it's impossible to be mad at him. Remember when I had to see all those doctors? He consoled me, although he wanted a kid himself. It was so important. No, Claudia. I' m sure he'd have made a great dad. Hi! Hi! ... He just got home. Susanne? - Here! I' ll call you in the next few days. Yes, I' ll tell him. Bye. Claudia said to say hello. Is something wrong? Hektor? Fritz? Is everything okay? Wait, I' ll get some scissors. Damn it! Hold on! Come here! I' ll do it all at once! One, two, three! Everything's okay! They were after car papers and keys. What else? - No idea. Find out. It's your job, isn't it? Jurek, do you have one for me? - My last one, boss. - Thanks. Everyone knows there are no keys here at night. - I' m glad you know. Now you can catch those four crooks with no trouble. - Why four? Maybe there were more, but to drive off with four cars, according to my calculations ... Yeah, I didn?t think of that. I know what you're thinking. But after the last unsolved robbery, my insurance was cancelled. I get no damage payments, so forget insurance fraud. Fritz! Come on, I' ll drive you home! I used to come here with my father. Sunday afternoons, feeding the ducks. I always envied the other kids. They had pieces of bread nicely cut up into little cubes. And I had to break off pieces from big chunks of bread. It was really tough when the chunks were hard. We never talked much. We stayed until dark, so my mom could have her peace and quiet. Where is your mother? - Dead. Now I' ll show you something, okay? This was it. Over there was the hangar. And behind it was the runway. And this parking lot used to be where we kept our planes. I' m a car dealer. I don't get more romantic than this. There you are. Cheers. - Cheers. What's it like to fly? Flying? How should I describe it ... Come on, you owe it to me. I was ... 16 or 17. I was in the G ST. Remember it? It was a state-run sports club. They had gliders, too. That's where my brother Peter and I learned how to fly. It was a wonderful time. Until my brother Peter fled to West Germany. My mother and I found out the next morning. He took my training plane. The airport was off-limits to me that very same afternoon. I was standing over there. There used to be a fence. It was so ... Well! Suddenly, something was missing. It was as if somebody came along and told you, " I' m taking away the color red. From now on you're going to see everything minus red . " I never flew again after that. I just couldn't. That's what it's like to fly. Like the color red? Or yellow ... or green or blue ... Simple yet elegant, this stone-gray Persian lamb coat made of faux fur. In this autumn's trendy colors, this skirt and top in black and silver. But the finishing touch is a necklace which is worn like a collar. Thank you very much. And finally, a look at men's fashion. This season, stripes are in. They give new impulses to men's fashion. A soft and flowing woolen fabric makes for pleasant summer wear. Very daring, gentlemen, but very attractive. - A handsome man. - They're all gay. I hope you enjoyed it, and please pay me a visit. I' m Susanne Willenbrock, from Boutique Willenbrock. Please join me for some champagne. Thank you. And now? Voil?. But there aren't any ducks. What? What a shame. Hey, let's go to that exhibition: " Pictures from Paradise." It's " Pictures from the Hereafter." That's what I meant. By that guy Waldersee. Why? - I met him recently. He sold me his car. So what? - I' m interested ... ... in pictures about death. - You? All that fuss they make about life, death and immortality. I don't even know what to do on a Sunday afternoon. You've suddenly started reading Goethe poems, you volunteered to go to that exhibit with me. What's wrong? I just don't want to look like an idiot next to you. So why didn?t't you think of that in the last 10 years? Oh look. Isn't this your style? What a ... - Hello. - Bernd. Hey, Eberhard. What a surprise. - Yes. Hi there. - It's been a while. Lots to do, buddy. - Hello. So, how are you doing? - There's no stopping the downfall. Well ... We're interested in that bed. - Really? So are we. - Oh. Our whole bedroom's Biedermeier style. - That's Historicism. - Oh? You're the expert. But it suits us quite well. What do you say, Ebs? Yes, but if you two want it ... - Susanne wasn't quite sure. Says who? - For heaven's sake, you take the monstrosity. I don't know what we need it for. - I do. Well, I guess we' II have to duel over it. No, you can have it. First come, first serve. ... appealed for calm. The interior minister warned that ... Bernd, I ... Damn it! - Hey! Hey! Hey! This will never work! - Take it easy. This damn thing just isn't our style. - Would you please get the other post? What did we buy it for anyway? - You had to have it. Me? Now I' m the one who wanted it. - I can't hold it any longer. Didn?t you say: It's our style, dear? - Susanne! - You didn?t say "dear." If you don't put that post in at once, there's going to be an accident! Please. Are you out of your mind? Very funny! You little witch! You're a bad girl! You little witch! Bernd, listen! What? - Bernd! Go back to bed, dear. The window. Get in here! Climb out the window! Please! Out the window! Fast! Get out, you bastard! Who's there? - Open the door, please! We've been robbed! - Robbed? Who are you? It's us! - Willenbrocks! - The house behind the dike! Ah, the Willenbrocks! - Yes! Yes, but come as fast as you can. Yes. Thanks. Goodbye. Sorry, they asked us to stay here, because ... They' ll be right over. That's kind of you. Thanks. Can we do anything for you? - No, thank you. Some wine? ... Perhaps? No, thanks. - Or some schnapps? Yes, well ... We have to ... Just make yourselves comfortable. We have two suspects ... Russians. You said they might be Russian. Yes. Are you ready for a line-up? - Of course. - Okay. Come on, don't worry. What are you afraid of? They' ll be behind a mirror. They can see us, but we can't see them. No, the other way around. We can see them ... Like on TV. - Bernd! Here they are. Step up closer, if you like. Thank you. They can't see you. It's okay. Come on. Well? What do you think? Was it them? Yes, it was them. Are you sure? Yes, I am ... It was them. Move it, comrades! Come on! Anything else? You look so uncertain. Yes, it was dark and ... You aren't sure. - How can I be completely sure? I was fighting for my life. Okay. My key is gone! And my wallet, with all my papers! Just take it easy. My purse was in the living room, by the fireplace. Are you sure? - Yes! Why didn?t't you check if anything was missing? - I forgot. It was too much. Susanne! They have my key, and they know where we live! - Just calm down! They're in jail. And tomorrow I' ll have a new lock installed. The explosion was so big that people standing by the window were thrown onto the street. Many were torn to pieces... What time is it? - Four. What time was it yesterday? Four. What's wrong? I can't stop thinking about it. I might be able to forget if you took your nightie off. I' ll never be able to forget. Listen, let's make an oath, okay? We want to forget about it, right? We don't want it to be part of our lives anymore, do we? So let's forget about it now. We' ll live the way we used to. They can't get to us, can they? Boss, Mr. And Ms. Friedrich have been waiting for 30 minutes! They shouldn't make such a fuss. They're in for it anyway. How nice to meet you, Ms. Friedrich. I' m Mr. Willenbrock. - Hello. And all the nifty extras. Lighted passenger side mirror, hands-free phone, and last but not least, a navigation system. What about that humming sound? - That's the motor. Just kidding. I can't hear anything except the normal sound of the motor. Then something must be wrong. - This car is in top condition. I'd bet my life on it. Sure, it isn't a new car. You have to lower your expectations. - You don't lower the price, do you? You won't find a better car for this price. - Easy for you to say. Believe me. I've been a car dealer for quite a few years. I never believe car dealers, out of principle. I don't believe I've given you reason to mistrust me, have I? What about the brakes? - What about them? The stopping distance is much too long, isn't it? You can't expect brakes to do more than that, can you? All because of those fucking Russians! They should put up the wall again! Some countries need two walls, so crooks like that can't just walk over. I' ll have one, okay? - Yeah. Other people want to live, too. You want more money? - If you think that my work is worth more, you can give me more money. Yeah, why not? Whether I' m bankrupted by taxes or by my employee, it's all the same. How are things at home? - At home? My son ran away, and my wife wants a divorce. But everything else is fine. You never told me. - She said I don't take good care of her. Even though last year I bought her a new ... lawn mower. A lawn mower, huh? - Yes, brand new. That's no way to treat women, Jurek. I was looking for Anna. - Yeah, she's in the back. Thanks. Anna, you have a visitor! Good evening! Boss ... is something wrong? I told Jurek I'd be an hour late. Yes, no ... everything's fine. I just wanted to ... - He wanted to wish me happy birthday. Yes, exactly. Happy birthday, Anna, and all the best. Thank you. This is Bernd Willenbrock, my car dealer, and my father's boss. - But you don't even have a car. Not yet, but we're working on it. Have a drink with us, boss. I don't know ... Just a little one. So, friends, let's all toast to Anna. Anna, here's to you and your beautiful ... ... feet. I hope that you ... don't have to use them so much this year. Best wishes from your car dealer. Cheers, Fritz! Cheers! Nobody's dancing here. Doesn't anyone want to dance? Maybe later. Boss, the young people want to be alone now. Yeah, sure. I guess I' ll be going. I just want one little dance. - I don't want to! Just one little ... Stop it! - A farewell dance. - I don't want to! Don't be like that! It's enough! You're absolutely drunk! Everything's okay! What's going on here? All the lights are on. My God, Susanne, you really gave me a scare. What are you doing? I had to celebrate a birthday. It was Fritz's 60th birth day. My night watch man. You know him. I had to go. Why didn?t't you call? - What? It wasn't possible. Is something wrong? - I' m afraid! I hear sounds that don't exist! And you get drunk! I refuse to listen to this shit! I had such a nice evening. Come on, let's go to bed. I' ll just put my things in the safe. Oh fuck, where is my briefcase? Stop over there. - Right here? - Yeah, at the corner. Don't start screaming! - I didn?t ask you to drive me. - Okay! I' ll be right back. I' ll be right back! You stupid bitch! I don't believe it! What a pile of shit! Good morning. Tell me the truth. Do you love me? Are you kidding? I' m in the process ... Seriously! I want to know if you still love me. Of course I do. Okay. Sorry. Want a ride to work again? I' m staying here. I' m not going. Why not? - I don't feel good! Stop worrying yourself to death! They're locked up! What if it wasn't them? You weren?t even sure yourself. A suitcase was discovered at the Cologne train station... I' m sorry, but we have to repeat the line-up. - And why's that? I want to be certain. I want to be certain that it was really them. But you couldn't identify them. No, I wasn't certain. I was suddenly faced with two guys who had just wanted to kill me. Okay, we can change your statement, but that's all we can do. What do you mean by that? We aren't allowed to keep them for more than 48 hours. After that, we either issue an arrest warrant or we let them go. I' m sorry. The D.A. Decided to deport them. They've been released? Did I wake you? I called you at noon. Jurek said you were on your way home. Yes. I picked up the alarm system. - All afternoon? I had to go somewhere. I went to see that police inspector. But there's no news. No news? - She wasn't there. I drove there for nothing. Why did you go to see her? - There we go. Listen, when you open the door, you have 20 seconds to enter the code. Otherwise the alarm goes on. Ready? Damn it! It still doesn't work! Once more. Susanne, I' m doing this for your security. You realize that? Why did you go see the inspector? - Why? Why? Why? I wanted to know what's going on! That's all! That's all? You should go back to work. Being home isn't good for you. Looking for me? Vera! Yes ... no ... always. I don't have any time now. See you soon. I' ll call you, okay? Hi, everybody. I have to talk to you. Come on. Enjoy the meal. What's wrong with you? First you show up on my birth day, and now here! Yeah, I had to see you. - I told you on the phone that I had no time. I want you to respect that. I just want to make amends for your birth day. Or did I screw everything up? I normally don't drink. - It can happen. I was all messed up. First the robbery at work, and then the break-in at my weekend house. I' m sorry for you, but ... - I wanted to tell you I' m okay again. Okay, okay. Do I get another chance? I have class. Come and look at your birth day present first. You can't do that. - Yes, I can. I can't imagine anyone but you in that car. Happy birthday. It's me! I really hurried to get home, so you wouldn't be alone so long. Damn it! What's going on here? Oh no! You're home at last! Where were you? I was at the Waldersee exhibition. - Alone? - Claudia's out of town. Why the heck did you leave everything on? The bathroom is flooded! - Here, from the D.A. You knew! A minor offense. That pig. You knew they were released! Bullshit! They could have been here, outside our door! And I wouldn't have known! - I didn?t want to upset you! Stop deciding for me! I want ... The alarm! Why did it go on so late? You told me to set it for three minutes! Why won't it stop? It won't stop until you shut it off! How does it work? Help me! That was the fuse. - I hate you. The fuse box is in the basement. I' m sorry. I' m sorry. You want a cigarette, too? Here. We ... We should sell our weekend house. - No way. They can't do this to us. We won't let them. Please, Bernd. I want to forget the whole thing. Yes ... But not until they're locked up again. Natural stone is no problem. We can get you everything. A biography, a good friend and stones. What are stones anyway? Have the burglars really been deported? I bet they're back again. They have our address. They know where we live. Maybe they want to see us again. That makes me very sad, my friend. I'd like to help you. That's very nice of you. But that's the job of the police. This is a personal gift. Don't touch it. Give me 200 euros for it. 200 euros, and this gift is yours. Do you trust me? I have no idea what this is about, but, of course, I trust you. It's bad luck to give certain things as gifts. But business deals are always nice. You' ll see how valuable it is. And one more thing ... Open it when you're alone. He isn't in! - That can't be ... That is not ... Make an appointment. - I want a new line-up! Please, leave! The crooks are out in 48 hours, and I got to wait 3 weeks to see you. - Out! Or I' II charge you with trespassing and coercion! If you're handling the case, I' II be fine. Give me the letter. Come on. I don't know what the case is about. This is all from today: Thefts, break-ins, driving without a license. Always the same. Not enough evidence. A minor offense. So we have to let them go. We deport illegal immigrants. We send them a summons or a fine later. Sometimes we issue an arrest warrant. So what? Could you hold this? One of them actually showed up to do his prison term. Pechkov, a Russian. A name I' II never forget. Here it is. He said he could earn more in a German jail than at home. There's nothing I can do, on account of your statement. - I said they could be the ones! " Could" isn't enough for a warrant. Maybe I shouldn't tell you, but ... ... even if you had identified them, I probably would've deported them. You would've released them even though they were guilty? Not released. Deported. Nowadays, people only get prison for capital offenses like murder. What a shame they didn?t kill me! No, you were lucky. Do you realize what I deal with here? Get yourself a lawyer. Go see the state attorney. Then what? Will justice be done? NO TRESPASSING! It look s real. Yes, it's supposed to. It sounds real, too. Where did you get it? I've always had it ... at the used-car lot. And now you're carrying it around? I don't know where to keep it. I don't want the wrong people to get a hold of it. It could cause lots of trouble. Why don't you go to bed. I' II be there in a minute. I' II be there in a minute. You really think they were the men who robbed you? - Yes. I just don't know what to do. Should I go to the police? You Germans are so official. Always going to the authorities. If God were German, the world would be so well organized, wouldn't it? Adam and Eve and a German God. Man never would've fallen from grace. On the other hand, what kind of paradise would that be? Don't you know where they're from? Moscow, two brothers. The police even gave me their addresses. Give me their names. What for? We know someone who could manage the matter. I' m not doing it for you. I' m doing it for myself. Moscow, my hometown. It isn't good. What do you mean by " manage"? One could make sure they are unable to go out for a while. Give me their names. I don't know where I put that paper. We're in no hurry. Give me a call after you've thought it over. Thank you, Dr. Krylov. Willenbrock? - Yes? - Did you like my gift? Oh yes, it's great. Is something wrong with the car? - No, she said you'd understand. Get out! Where is she? Leave it, boss! Leave it! The topping-out ceremony! - I' II be right back! Bernd, I' m in a hurry. I' ll drive you home. - I' m going somewhere else. - Fine. Bernd, I don't want to. There's no sense in it. No sense in what? Is it because I' m married? - Bernd! We're just too different. But that's the fun of it. We have arguments. I always give you the wrong present. You're so well-read. And I' m such an idiot. It's what I've always wanted! I' m in a rut, and suddenly you come along. - Get a grip! You don't really care about me. - Yes, I do. I want to be with you. And I' m going to St. Petersburg in a few months. For one whole year. It's stupid to start a relationship now. A waste of time for a few kick s. Don't you think you're being ... too academic? It's realistic! - But life is no escalator! Detours are the spice of life. There has to be room for something irrational and unrealistic. If you want to be irrational, go ahead! Who's stopping you? But it has nothing to do with me. Fine, then I' ll go to Petersburg with you. - Bernd ... I don't want to be with you. It isn't enough for me. Suse, my love. I' m back. Everything will be just like in the old days. I have to re-organize my life. I have to become more realistic. Being irrational can be nice ... Are you breaking up with me? I' m afraid so. It isn't really necessary. - Why not? My God, we met every few months to fuck. That's all right. It's a nice place. Why do you want to sell it? Well, we need the money. Good old money. How old is the electrical wiring? - Must be 8 years old. - 9 years. That old? Where's the furnace? There isn't any. But we have a very nice fireplace. It's especially cozy in the winter. Very cozy. Do you really want to sell it? I' m sure he' ll get us a good profit. The way he came in here! He wanted to take us for a ride. In the end, I think he wanted to buy it himself. So, have you thought about where to go on vacation? Hawaii is supposedly very nice ... Cuba, too. Bernd, I ... I want a divorce. Are you kidding? I want to start a new life. Yes ... I can understand. We've been through a lot ... - I want to sell the store. Business wasn't going well anyway. I got a job in a gallery. - Great. Maybe you' ll have more luck this time. Would you hand me the cups? - Bernd! I don't love you anymore. Is there anything else? Maybe that you're seeing somebody? Typical! You never think I can make my own decisions! No, I don't, because I've been making all your fucking decisions for years! You weren?t even able to find a job! Maybe I don't go to the opera or to exhibits with you! But I do bring in the money! And that's nothing to scoff at! You always held your hand out! - Yes, damn it! And I' m ashamed of myself! For accepting your gifts and flowers when you came home from some woman! For turning a blind eye so long! You've got some imagination! Now the tables are turned! Get out of there! I said get out of there! Happy New Year. - Same to you. Oh, it's you! Up this early? Yes. Say ... I' m looking for Susanne. You don't happen to know ... No. She said she got a job at an art gallery, and ... Yes, I know. Why do you paint this stuff? These pictures about death? I can't really say. A glass of wine? Maybe so I can deal with my fear. We're afraid of what we don't understand. But if we know the abyss, it's easier to know real beauty. That's all just romantic nonsense. You can paint. Why don't you paint life? Life is beautiful, isn't it? Good evening, boss. - Good evening. I just wanted to check on things. I tried to cook Polish carp at home. Polish carp, Jurek. But I couldn't kill it. So I threw it into the Elbe. No idea if an animal like that can survive in the Elbe, considering how brown the water is. So, how are things at home, Jurek? Fine. But not so fine either. The mother of my wife just ... ... died. And the death brought us ... how do you say ... ... closer together again. Death. How nice. Do you mind ... if I stay a while? Of course not. Here ... Like some schnapps? You look like an Eskimo. I was worried. You weren?t home, and the way everything looked ... The carp. I wanted to make Polish carp. You used to make it so well. Yeah. I wanted to say that I' m staying with Claudia. Yeah, sure. It'd be better if I got my own apartment. Aren't you cold? I've started dreaming again. I recently dreamed about a man. He was running across a railway bridge, and I kept running after him. I didn?t know why I was running after him, but I had the feeling that I knew him well. Very well. Like I know... myself. Then I woke up. And the sun was shining in my face. You know I'm not a man of big words, but... life has to go on, doesn 't it? Subtitles John R.
