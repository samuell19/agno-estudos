TOEI COMPANY LTD. 1651, UNDER THE REIGN OF THE THIRD SHOGUN, TOKUGAWA IEMITSU. Edo city is now crammed with masterless samurai and tramps from other provinces. And they are causing public disturbances. Of course, this doesn't threaten the secure government under Tokugawa lemitsu. MATSUDAIRA IZOENOEKAMI NOBUTSUNA CHIEF OF THE COUNCIL OF ELDERS But putting this aside, the conduct of these rogues in our Shogun's own city... may result in disgracing his leadership. Chief Elder Matsudaira's orders! Expel all the masterless samurai and tramps from Edo... from this moment on. Whether or not these retainers, especially of extinct lords... are now making trouble... should be thoroughly checked. Those who actively oppose your investigation or attempt to run away... should be killed on the spot! Now, the following places need a strict masterless samurai hunt...

SHOGUN TOKUGAWA IEMITSU DIED IN FEBRUARY, 1651 Chief! Something is going on. Lords were summoned to Edo castle. What? They are rushing to the castle. Sounds interesting. Our chance has come at last. Daimyo mansions will be short of guards. All right. Let's go! Intruders! Look here! Blame your extravagant life! Be quiet! I won't kill you. Mortuary tablet! Mortuary tablet! Hey! You, sir. How about... ...wearing this for once in your life? Everybody tightens their purse strings. Times are indeed bad. Constables! Constables are coming! They are here! Gather here, merchants! I want all merchants over here quickly. Are you a merchant? We will confiscate all the goods here. Oh, no, please! Enough! Excuse me, sir. What is it? Thanks. Patrol this area. Idiot! You fool! Are you selling stolen goods? No, sir! I'm only making a honest living. Shut up! LORD MITO, DEPUTY SHOGUN HOSHINA MASAYUKI, LORD OF AIZU. IEMITSU'S YOUNGER BROTHER Lord Aizu... I would like to know how you are planning to conduct government affairs. What do you mean, sir? Now that Iemitsu is dead... you are his younger brother and... an advisor to his son and the heir to the Shogun. You are the key man now. Where is Lord Matsudaira? Why didn't he attend the council at this critical moment? Lord Hotta has just submitted his resignation to the Council. Please allow me to follow the late Shogun to the grave. Thank you for everything. Farewell, gentlemen. AT 10 AM, LORD HOTTA FOLLOWS THE LATE SHOGUN TO THE GRAVE. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, LORD ABE ALSO COMMITS SUICIDE. I hear that Lord Hotta and Lord Abe followed the late Shogun to the grave. I see. You may go. Don't let anyone enter this room. Understood. Those who burglarize the lords' residences and cause a public nuisance... are Iga ninja, after all. Lord Naito! I will behead you in a memorial service to be held for the... masterless samurai you have killed. Wait! I know you are Hattori Hanzo. Hanzo, Iwould like you to meet a certain person. Who is it? You will see. Come to Ryotokuji Temple at 10 tomorrow morning! Come in. Are you Hattori Hanzo? Show me your face! Behave yourself, Hanzo! This is Lord Izu Matsudaira! Lord Izu? Anything wrong, Hanzo? You are looking at me as if you have seen a ghost or something. You are alive. Yes, I am alive. But I am only existing like a living corpse. I must use an artifice which will make me come back to real power. Won't you give me a hand, Hanzo? You will get whatever you name in return. Either money or a position. Or both. I will give you what you would never be able to get... in a lifetime the way you are. What's my job? Lord Aizu. Kill him? What's your answer? The answer is no. What? I don't trust Shogunate people like you. Watch you tongue, Hanzo! Shut up! How did you treat the last Hattori Hanzo? You threw him away like a rag after using him up. We, Iga ninja, are not idiots who have forgotten their grudge against you. I see. But Hanzo... I have already told you about such a serious matter. Do you think you will be able to leave here safely? Sure... I will manage to get out of here without any harm. RiniPyoiToh’Sha... KaiiJiniRestuiZaiiZen. RinaRyoiTohiShaiKaiiJiniRetsuiZai... After persuading Hanzo... I was planning to go ahead with the help of both the Koga and Iga ninja. But you are my only reliable support now. We have got to kill Hanzo first. How did it go, Chief? Lord Izu is alive. But word is out that he is dead. And there was a monster there. Monster? He is all black from head to toe. He may be Izo's tool, but I wonder who he is. Be quiet or you will be killed. Who are you? My name is Upper Hanzo. Remember that. Young Lord is only eleven years old. There might appear men who want to control him. Then political turmoil will come next. So don't rest on your position, even if you earned it easily. What are you after? I came to sell my skills to you. What do you want? The reinstatement of the Hattori family. If I refuse... will you go to the others with my head? The wise man knows how to wait for a chance and select his master. So I will leave you tonight. The time will come when you will need me badly. Just keep your eyes open. Don't tell me what to do. I will see you again. Long time no see, Upper Hanzo. It's you, Lower Hanzo. Where are you? Come out. Just keep walking. Walk straight ahead. Don't be arrogant. What's your business in a samurai's mansion? Offering my services. How foolish! Are you still engaged in burglary? So what? I will steal whateverI can from the Shogunate. You think small. What? Now is the time of political disturbances. Why not seize the whole country? The whole country? I gather Lord Aizu is our trump card. If we assist him, in holding the reins of the Shogunate... we will be able to rule over the land. Lord Aizu is also a Shogunate man. I can't trust him. You haven't forgotten how the Shogunate treated OUR predecessor... Have you? You mean our father? That's right. Despite his services, the Shogunate was harsh to him... and caused him to die. Both of our houses risked themselves for the Shogunate as spearheads. And many died in their struggles for the Shogunate. But once peace reigned over the land... they were neglected for they knew too much. That's enough! Listen, Hanzo! Never forget this humiliation. I will protest to the Shogunate against this injustice, with my death. You must live and dedicate your life... to the prosperity of the Hattori with Lower Hanzo. Hanzo! You haven't killed anyone yet. Kill me now and inherit all of the Iga ninja's fighting spirit. Father! Father! Behead me, Hanzo! Bring my head to the Hanzo Gate and display it! Hang it high on the Hanzo Gate. Don't hesitate! Behead me quickly, Hanzo! Do it now! Father! Do a good job, Hanzo! I have never forgotten my father even for a moment. I will avenge myself on them in my own way. The best way is to pair up with someone in the Shogunate. But you might parallel our predecessor. I am different from him and I am sure I will succeed. Won't you lend a hand? I'm content to be a thief. I will go my own way. Suit yourself. Hey, won't you come to my place? Kohagi will be happy to see you. Some other time. I have got something to do. I also have many followers with the same aim in life. Earn five ryo per head today. I will make 10 ryo... Have a nice day. We are off! What's wrong, Koroku? They are all gone. Why are you still here? Go quickly, Koroku! What's the idea? Don't! Stop it. Please! Koroku, no! Please! Stop it! You fool! Stop it! Stop it, Koroku! Please! Please! What's wrong? Tell me what is wrong. I wet my pants! No! Stop it! What did you do to Kohagi? Nothing, Chief! Brother, stop it! Forgive me, Chief. Don't hurt him. Brother! Sorry. You idiot! Are you all right, Kohagi? You fool! It's time to think about your future. Right, Kohagi?! You can't stay with us any longer. I met Upper Hanzo last night. You had better go to his place. You like him, don't you? What on earth have you been doing?! The tramps in Edo just keep growing in number! Why can't you control them?! If this job is too tough for you, hand in your resignation! But we are in mourning for Tokugawa lemitsu. And Lord Aizu has forbidden any needless killing. Shut up! Disregard the orders! Just do exactly as I tell you! Who is that black monster who works for Izu? Nothing to say yet? I will fix you so you never say another word. What's wrong? What are you doing here? Hey, what are you doing here? Look! He is trying to speak! Did you hear that? He is Lord Naito! He must be out of his mind. Move away! Unfasten the fetters! We shouldn't have done that, Chief. The cops are making a frantic search for the culprit. Chief! He is right. We had better leave Edo now. Don't talk such nonsense! We will be arrested soon. Tens of thousands of people live in this town. That's why we are safe here. That's right. We are safe as long as we slip in among the crowds. I don't mind moving out if you feel uneasy here. Open the window, Koroku. I have been unhappy with that a long time. The sight of the castle cuts me to the quick. Let's move out! We are moving out, Koroku. Go to Upper Hanzo’s. Brother! Okay? Go to Upper Hanzo! Go on! Kohagi! Who sent you here? My brother told me to look after you. What a man! Can I stay? Look Kohagi... This isn't a place for a woman. 300,000 ryo is an exorbitant sum of money. Even leading Edo merchants like us cannot raise the money easily. You must do it. How long do I have? Within three days. That's impossible! Do you want to see hardheaded Lord Aizu come to power? He will issue a regulation on debt cancellation once he comes to power. Under the regulation, people will be entitled to cancel their debts. He's even planning to restrict the prices of rice, salt and lumber. But, if I come back to power, there will be no problems for you. I don't think the 300,000 ryo is too much for that. All right, Sir. What are you planning to do with the 300,000 ryo? How you are going to contribute the money is written here. 100,000 ryo to Lord Mito. 30,000 ryo to Lord Kishu and Lord Owari respectively. 25,000 ryo to Lord Sakai. 25,000 ryo to Lord li. 25,000 ryo to Lord Izu Matsudaira. Eat it up! 25,000 ryo to Lord Iga Naito. 20,000 to Lord Abe. 20,000 to Lord Nagai. Is that all? We will manage it. Is the chief in? He is upstairs. Where do we go next? Wealthy merchants will deliver their money to some lords for Izu. So we will steal it. That sounds interesting. But this job won't be easy as our previous jobs were. What do you mean2 I met the monster at Izu's mansion again. Is he a Koga Ninja? Yeah, his gang will be on the alert in anticipation of our attack. We will have to beat them for Iga's honor. Fight to the death. Come up, everybody. You idiot! These are the deputy Shogun's goods! Get away! It was a trap! Put out the fire! Chief, this is hopeless. There's no chance against them. Shishido! Ready! Here we go! Daigo! RiniPyoiToh’ShaiKaiiJiniRetsuPZaiiZen. Attack their left. Chief! Yamahachi! OTAKIMURA, CHICHIBU PROVINCE How can I pray for you2 Pray for the health of the new Shogun. Because the young lord is susceptible to sickness. Certainly, Madam. Chief, Kohagi's back. Kohagi? Kohagi. What's the matter? Tell me what happened! Now, tell me! Kohagi! What's all this about, Upper Hanzo? I brought her back to you. What's wrong with my sister? Brother! Stay away! Hanzo, listen to me. Now, listen! Stop it! Chief, stop fighting! Now stop it! We have no time for a family fight! Don't talk so big. Brother! I married her off to you. Take her back to your place. Now, listen to me! No! Hanzo! How can I live in peace with her when you are in trouble? You badly need every hand you can get. Is the Koga the enemy? Their chief is Koga Shirobei. He is a monster. Koga Shirobei... I will kill him. It's no time for you to go on being a loner. He will track the Iga ninja until he exterminates them. I will stand up to him. I need your help. In order to hold power under Aizu we have to kill Izu and Shirobei by any means. I'm not interested in holding power. But I will do anything in the world to kill them. Thank you, Hanzo. What's Izu's next move? He will kill Lord Aizu and Lord Nagai, his roadblocks. Sorry to have misunderstood you. Kohagi! TOKUGAWA IETSUNA TOKUGAWA IEMITSU'S HEIR I'm Nagai Shinano, a new member of the Council of Elders. It is a great honor and privilege to accept the appointment. I'm prepared to sacrifice my life... for the successful completion of your inaugural ceremony as Shogun. Your Excellency... Shinano, thank you. Lord Nagai... I am Jokai, I pray for the young lord, to protect him from evil. There is only one month left till his inaugural ceremony as Shogun. In order for him to complete it successfully in the presence of the envoy. Iwould like to propose that he visit Nikko. Would you please consider it? Visit Nikko? Yes. Before his inaugural ceremony, the late Tokugawa lemitsu went there to report it to Tokugawa leyasu's grave. That's why he became such a distinguished Shogun. His mother was greatly impressed by his homage... Lord Nagai, don't let Lord Aizu attend the Council tomorrow. Tomorrow's Council, tomorrow's Council... Kill him who would become a great obstacle to the Shogunate. Kill him. Let's talk over dinner. Help yourselves. In starting the new government... Iwould like to enforce strict official discipline. Under the late Tokugawa lemitsu, there were some... who tried to enrich themselves by taking advantage of his favor and their position. So at tomorrow's Council... Shinano? Lord Nagai, don't let Lord Aizu attend tomorrow's Council. Tomorrow's Council, tomorrow's Council... Kill him who would become a great obstacle to the Shogunate. Kill him. Lord Nagai, what is wrong?! Wretch! Are you out of your mind, Lord Nagai?! Shinano, calm down! My Lord! Please calm down! My Lord! Calm down! Just keep quiet! Keep this incident a secret! Shinano died of a sudden illness. Cover it in this way. Understood? My Lord! Who is there? You were trapped, weren't you? What do you mean? Lord Nagai didn't go mad. It's an enemy trap to discredit you and Lord Nagai at the same time. Who are you? But Nagai couldn't have doubleicrossed me. Right. But if there is a monster who can drive him mad? Who can it be? Koga Shirobei. A Koga ninja? He must have cast a strange spell over Lord Nagai. Koga Shirobei has some technique through which he can control another's mind. Was Nagai controlled by him? And the one who controls Shirobei is Lord Matsudaira. Look... Lord Matsudaira followed the late Shogun to the grave. He is still alive. And eagerly awaiting a chance to return to power. Come on in! I saw him alive. Who is this? Hattori Hanzo. Hanzo? And you are? I'm also Hattori Hanzo. What? The Iga ninja have Upper and Lower Hattori. I belong to the Upper Hattori. He is from the Lower Hattori. The Upper lives like a shadow, and the lower lives like grass. The Upper lives with nonininja under an alias. The Lower rides the tide and appears if he is needed. I see. I will hire both. What do you want? The reinstatement of the Hattori. As Shogun's agents? No. As direct retainers of the Shogun. The first Hattori Hanzo was entitled to receive 5,000 koku as a direct retainer of Tokugawa leyasu. Cut it out! But the second Hanzo was demoted to the Shogun's agent. And my father was ordered under confinement for knowing too much. He committed suicide in anger. Now the Hattori family is all in needy circumstances without social status. I will certainly grant your wish. What about the other Hanzo? What do you want? Tell me your wish. I don't know. I'm a casual sort of person. I will think about it after I kill Koga Shirobei. Let's go! Here comes Lord Matsudaira. Lord Aizu, I have just heard that Lord Nagai passed away recently. He was your rightihand man. I'm terribly sorry. What's the matter? You look so pale. In fact, I'm shocked. I thought you, Lord Kaga, and Lord Tsushima... followed the late Shogun to the grave. Who told you that? Since the Shogun has passed away, everyone is acting strangely. So you came, Izu. Lord Mito, I haven't seen you for quite a while. I'm glad you are in good health. Lord Aizu... I have something Iwant to talk to you about. Listen to me carefully. In fact, I called Matsudaira who was in mourning. May I ask why? I'm averse to the idea of following one's lord to the grave. I don't believe in sacrificing a capable man for the sake of a cruel custom. Nagai Shinano passed away suddenly. It's high time Matsudaira revived the position. He will be of help to you. I beg your pardon, sir. I'm afraid I can't believe that Lord Mito said that. Zusho, silence! But, my lord! We are different from those court nobles and merchants in Kyoto. We need to reiterate the honored samurai spirit. But if you ignore the samurai spirit you will degrade the new Shogun and shake the Shogunate to its foundations. Who is this? Aoyama Zusho. He was appointed as a valet to our young lord. Zusho, your story makes sense. But, you are chained to an olditime custom. It's our duty to serve the new Shogun after his father passed away. We must be loyal to the new Shogun as his predecessor. Serve the Tokugawa family. That's the sincerest way of the samurai. That's nonsense! Zusho, behave yourself! Damn Aizu... He has guessed what happened to Nagai and challenged us. Shirobei... We must take the next step. Are you ready? The young lord will go to visit the Nikko Shrine soon. THE NIKKO ROAD Make way for the procession... IMACHI INN, NIKKO ROAD Sir Yata! I was to wake up the young lord when Ifound his mother and the housemaid were like this... and the young lord was gone. Zusho! We were framed. Matsudaira did this. We must find him before the Imperial envoy comes. Koga Shirobei did it. He plotted all this knowing the young lord would stay here. Where is the young lord? I have no idea. Where is Koga Shirobei? I wish I knew. Please, you are our only hope. Get the young lord back. Lord Hoshina is counting on you. Someone used sleeping incense and guided Shirobei. There was a spy around our young lord. What do you want? Kohagi! I brought her as I promised. Let me take responsibility for her. Good! I'm glad you have decided. No. I need her help. The young lord was kidnapped. What? I think Koga Shirobei did it on Matsudaira's order. I have no evidence yet. But, someone guided him from the inside... To find out... You need Kohagi in the castle. It's vitally important to get the young lord back. I refuse! Is Kohagi just a tool to feed your ambition? I'm not interested in rising to the top like you. We will kill Shirobei and Matsudaira never the less. Hanzo. What?! Brother! I will go. You may be killed! I'm aware of that. Kohagi is your wife anyway. Do what you like! Brother! Have you been well, Father? Young lord... Where is my young lord? Reverend Jokai has arrived, my lady. My lady! Leave her to me. When the young lord is found, she will be fine. I will pray for her first. I understand it is urgent. Lord Aizu... Is it true that the young lord disappeared on his way to Nikko? It is true. Someone kidnapped him. Lord Aizu! Why did you hide such an important crime? If something happens to him... I was worried that this news could panic the people. We are searching for him secretly. Do you have any clue as to where he could be? No, not yet. Sir Hoshina, you are at fault for this gross blunder. Take responsibility. Kohagi! Kohagi! Kohagi! Kohagi... Chief! RiniPyoiToh’Sha... KaiiJiniRetsuiZaiiZen. Chief! Koroku! Koroku! So, you are a Koga ninja? You killed my sister. You are Koga Shirobei's daughter, Chisato, aren't you? Where's the young lord? You scum! KOHAGI A Iga ninja attacked you... Was it Hanzo? You gave your body to him! Kill yourself. Slit your belly and... die with your enemy's child. You have tried to overthrow the government. The maids told me you did it. Confess your guilt! Where did you hide the young lord? Confess! It was a set up. I know what you want. You want to make me a scapegoat for your crime. You have committed a fraud against the public. You are a traitor who would do anything for your ambition! Hold your tongue! You must be destroyed by someone who cares about... his country! Silence, Zusho! Wait, Matsudaira! Kill him! Wait, Matsudaira... You will be judged before the lord... and sent to Hell for sure! ”Lord Hoshina Masayuki... ”you are incapable of assuming your duty. ”Therefore, you are to be released from that duty. ” Shirobei? I hid the young lord in the castle. You moved him to the castle? Don't worry, sir. It's the most isolated part. People are afraid to go there and there are no guards. It's the best place to hide him. But, Shirobei... how are we going to reveal the young lord? I'm worried that someone will expose our plan. We Koga ninja have devoted our lives to you, my lord. Don't lose your courage now. There's nothing to worry about. All we have to do is proceed as we planned. If you can't do it... leave the matter of the young lord to me. Chief! Here comes Shirobei. Shirobei! Hold on! Chief?! Get back. I'm glad the two Hanzo are here. Shut up, villain! I'm Lord Matsudaira's man. What's wrong with that? He will be number one soon. The outcome is clear. It makes no sense for the Koga and Iga ninja to kill one another. Why don't you make a pact with us? What do you want? I will get many treasures when Matsudaira comes into power. I will give you seventy percent of it all, if you withdraw from this right now. It's too late. I refuse. We Iga ninja have our own pride. You fool... As a ninja, I only tried to save your life. Shirobei, where is the young lord? You insist on reaching him? Go ahead and try to if you can. He's in the castle turret. The castle turret? Stop it! Shirobei tricked us. He performed a clever trick by hiding him in the castle. Chief, what will we do? Since Shirobei told us about the turret... there must be many, many traps. We must be very careful. But we must rescue him at any cost. There must be a way. All right! I don't know how this will turn out... but we will do our very best. Our best? We will break the turret if worse comes to worse. What? If we can't really beat them... we will destroy the turret. That is war. Our enemy, the young lord, and all of us... will die. Senior, just remember this. What we are risking our lives for is notjust one boy. We will plunder the young Tokugawa lord... and we will blackmail Matsudaira and his lowilife creatures. Ippei! Tsukumo, you go first with Tochimaru. Hide in the turret and prepare to destroy it. We have only five days before the imperial envoy comes. Don't make any mistakes. We can't afford it. Certainly. Senior, you got it? MARCH THE 18TH MARCH THE 19TH, THE NEXT DAY Not yet? That's a tough turret. It isn't that easy. God! I have a toothache. We can't wait any longer. Wait a little while. If we don't hear from them, we will go. Chief! Mimisuke! Chief! Did you do it? Let's go! Calm down! Make sure everything is ready. We will leave here one after the other, quietly... and we will meet in Myojin woods in half an hour. Who's there? Chief! Are you Koga Shirobei's daughter? Die! Let me kill her! Chief! What brings you here? Why did you spare my life? I am the one who killed Kohagi. You would have to do it anyway if you were ordered to do so as a ninja must. You are carrying my child. I will never bear it. Iga or Koga, the child is innocent! You are my wife. I wouldn't lie to you in the name of our child. I can't return to the Koga anymore. You are planning to kill yourself, aren't you? Don't go to the turret, please. You will never come back alive. I don't want to die alone. Wait! If you and I die, there will be no one to carry on. You must survive by all means. I pray I will see you again! Chief! I will leave the rest to you. Chief! Koga Shirobei? You are a tough Iga ninja. You made it this far. Give us the young lord. Take him if you can. Destroy the turret! Bring it down! Destroy the turret! Don't be in such a hurry. Destroy it! Senior! Hit it! My world spins on even as you kill me. So long as Matsudaira Izuino’Kami holds the reins of power... you will remain in total darkness. Senior! Forget about me! Save the young lord! Young lord... The Imperial envoy and his party will arrive soon. I understand... It's time to go. The young lord has arrived! The young lord has arrived! The young lord has arrived! Intruder! Get him! Lord Matsudaira! Lord Matsudaira! Lord Matsudaira! Special thanks to ”BigJohn” Subtitled and Mastered by Cannibal King www. KuroTokagi. com Retimed by timang for JPTVTS
