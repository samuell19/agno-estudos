Where are you? Hey, baby. There you are. Stand up. How much do you love me? You can prove it to me now. Vanessa, no, no, no!!! ♪ Your life"s blood flows ♪ ♪ Through my veins ♪ For all time we will remain ♪ ♪ Like a vice that will not bend ♪ ♪ You and me until the end ♪ I heard you singing. It"s prettier every time. It "s my mother" s lullaby. Do you really think I"m well enough to go back out there in the world? Two young men died, Vanessa. Nearly a third. Nothing will ever change that fact. But your brain was sick then. It"s not sick now, right? No. Shall we? Yeah. It"s going to be difficult adjusting to life in the outside world but you have to concentrate on your health. Remember, I"m here if you need anything. Anything? Thanks for letting me out early, doc. Lisa, come on! Better get a move on! ♪ Hey, come on. Let"s go. Hey, don"t you wanna see Katie? Come on. I"m not going anymore. Honey, we agreed you"d give it a try. They already held your scholarship for a whole semester. This is your shot, kiddo. Come on. I don"t care about gymnastics anymore. Do anything for me, baby. How much do you love me? I"ve never been able to watch those. Excuse me? Horror movies. I can"t watch "em. I"m a total wimp. I love them. That dude kinda looks like me. You"re right. Have you ever been strangled? Time"s up, Lisa Carmichael. Just make sure you mail those by the end of the month. Thanks. Next. Hi, Jim. Hey. What can I do for you? Hey. I need to ask for a little favour, Jim. Jimmy. Can I call you Jimmy? Sure. So I"ve been feeling a little out of place, starting the semester in January and all, and I feel like everybody knows everybody and I hardly know where I"m going. Do you think maybe you could show me around? I"d be happy to. You"re very sweet, Jimmy. Also, I know a bunch of the gymnastics girls are switching rooms this semester. Do you think maybe you could put me in a room with my girlfriend Lisa? I"d really owe you. I"ll see what I can do. You should be darn proud of this scholarship, you know that. Darn proud? Yes. All the hard work you put in, you and your mother. Yeah. It doesn"t mean anything without her. Your mother would never want you to give up on your dreams, especially because of her. Okay, I "m in the car, aren" t I? Do we have to keep on talking about this? Seriously, dad. Please. Honey, I know I haven"t been there enough for you these past few months... So I guess we do have to keep on talking about it. When they told me your mother only had a few months left I couldn "t... I couldn" t believe it. I thought if anybody could beat it, it would be her. She was always so strong. Dad, I felt like I lost you both. I know, honey. I"m sorry. But you didn"t, and you never will. You hear me? [laughing, chattering Katie? Hi. You must be Lisa. I"m Vanessa. Uh... where"s Katie? Who"s Katie? My-My roommate? Katie Williams? Uh, I"m your roommate. According to the office. Oh, I took that bed. I hope that"s ok. Uh... yeah. Ok. Wow, did you pack the whole house in this? Oh, well you"re not Katie. Nope. Sorry to disappoint. I"m Vanessa, the roommate. Matt Carmichael. The dad. I"m sorry, have we met before? Uh, no. I"m from Oregon. Oh. Wow, Lisa. Check it out. I mean, there"s four walls, a window, and a ceiling. I mean, I like it. Ok, you know what, Dad? I think I"m gonna walk you out, ok? Let"s go. Okay. I can"t stay with her. Ok, we"ll see how it goes, alright? Dad, I-I don"t wanna just see how it goes. - Please, I wanna go home. - Lisa. Katie and I had this all planned out. - It just doesn"t feel right. - Look, you throw this away, you"ll regret it for the rest of your life. You know who"d understand? Mom! Ok, you know what I"m gonna do? I"m gonna pick you up on Friday and we"re gonna have a fun weekend. Why are you doing this? Because this is the right thing for you, Lisa. You gotta trust me with this. And you know how much I love you, right? Dad, I don"t wanna go. Please. It"s ok. Please. At least we have our own bathroom. I thought we were gonna have to share with a bunch of random skanks. Yeah. Lucky us. What are those? Supplements. What kind? Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Vitamin A, Omega-3s. Gymnastics is pretty hardcore, huh? How do you know I do gymnastics? Um, your bag? Oh. Right. So um, what are you here for, Vanessa? I am an undecided freshman. Wait, how old are you? 25. And you-you"re a freshman? I"ve been travelling around and having fun. Right. Well, I gotta get to practise, but I"ll see you around, I guess. "All gymnasts fear injury. "Confidence is our armor. "Self-doubt is fatal. "Most gymnasts are superstitious. "They believe certain items can protect them. But they won "t." ♪ ♪ "Cause you got that something ♪ ♪ ♪ "Cause you got that something ♪ Oh my gosh, Lisa! Hi! - Katie! - Hi. It is so good to see you. I was worried you weren"t gonna come. What happened with our room? I-I thought we were gonna be together. I don"t know. I just found out. That sucks. Yeah, I know. Hey, are you ok, Lisa? Yeah. I don"t know, this is all just... a lot, you know? I don"t know if I can do this. Listen, we"ll do it together, ok? Ok. Oh my god, you will not believe the roommate they gave me. We should complain. What loser did they stick you with? Um... Sasha. Woops. Sorry, Sasha. I"m not complaining. So is that good, or... I mean, it"s what they told us. We"re unpacked now and everything. Right. Right. Sounds like you guys are all set then. I mean, we didn"t really have a choice... Yeah, you said that, Katie. Ok, is your roommate really that heinous? Let me think. She"s 25, a freshman, probably thinks texting"s a sport. Other than that... Vanessa. Uh, hi. Wait, you mean texting isn"t a sport? Wow, it is so exciting in here. Do you wanna go get some grub? Grub? Um, you know what? I was actually gonna go with them. Ok, yeah. I guess I"ll just see you back in the room then. Ok. Bye. Bye. Awkward. You know what, Vanessa? You should come with us. Yeah. We should all eat together. Why not? Travelling with a band? That sounds like fun. It was amazing. We got at least four years before we get to do anything exciting, right? Why? Is it like being in prison here? Is that why the food sucks? We are. Gymnastic prison. 30 hours a week plus classes. Lucky they give us time to eat. I"m sure you guys could skip once in a while. What"s the worst thing that could happen? You have no idea. When you"re trying to keep up with Lisa, full scholarship, four years all paid for. That"s how good she is. As long as she doesn"t crash and burn. Hey. What"s wrong? Nothing. I "m... I" m fine. What"s wrong with Sasha? Someone needs to slap that bitch. Yeah, no, you"re right. She"s... she just got bitter because I was the one that got the scholarship. Got it. Yeah. Yeah, what was she saying about you crashing and burning? Oh, my God! Well, technically if my GPA drops below 3.5 or if I don"t perform up to expectation then they could take my scholarship away. You know what? Sasha would probably celebrate. I mean, Katie seems ok. Though it wouldn"t hurt if she actually stood up for you once in a while. Really? I don"t know, I like Katie, I think she"s cool. We actually... We started doing gymnastics together in fourth grade. I was trying to get the office to let us switch rooms so that we could be together. You know, I"m sorry, this is not your fault at all. No, there"s no need to apologize. I like honesty. Life"s too short for fake BS. Yeah. You know, Vanessa... I lost my mom last summer. Cancer. So that"s... that"s why I came to school later than everyone else. I"m so sorry, Lisa. I lost my mom, too. Recently? No, I was little. I had to go live with my grandmother. Why didn"t your dad take you in? Because he"s a selfish prick. He didn"t want me. It "s ok, I" ve worked it out in therapy. Her last couple of weeks, I would bring her breakfast every single day, and one day... I went to bring the tray in. I thought that she was sleeping, and-and my arm brushed against her. She was so cold. Here, you need a hug. Come here. It"s ok. Shh. I"m sorry. When you lose your mom there"s a hole that never fills up. You"re hurting. We"re friends now. Hey, come here. Focus! You"re wasting your potential. She wasn"t even that bad. I know. Kennedy Connor, you"re up. Alright. Now that"s what I wanna see from the rest of you. Alright, Lisa Carmichael. Show us what you got. Come on, let"s go. Come on! Nicely done. Thanks. Cynthia was impressed with you. Really? How could you tell? Yeah, it was obvious. I bet you"ll get in some line-ups. Kate, don"t jinx me. I"m serious. Hey, look, are you still mad about the whole room thing? Because I don"t like it either. I mean, Sasha is a total neat freak. OCD. No, I mean, it"s not your fault. Besides, I like Vanessa. She "s... She" s cool. - Good. - Yeah. - You wanna hang out later? - Yeah, of course. Alright, I"ll text you after my last class, ok? Ok, bye. See ya. Are you stalking me? Ok, were you sitting there a minute ago? No, I appeared out of thin air. Shakespeare died 400 years ago and yet we"re still obsessing over him. Why do you think that is? Anybody? So where do you go next? Uh, history. No way, me too. What? History of Civil War and Reconstruction. Yeah. Well, maybe we can study together. Or you could do all the work and I could copy you. So how was your first week? Alright, I guess. Alright? I"ll take it. It"s better than "It"s terrible, Dad". Competition"s fierce. And so are you. I don"t know, Dad. Some of the other girls are really, really good. Like, Kennedy is totally killing it. Hang in there, honey. Remember what your mom always said. You"re not competing against the other girls, you"re just doing the best that you can do. Yeah, well it sounded a lot better coming from her. Yeah. Dad, do you remember when she used to videotape all my routines so that I could see what I was doing wrong and then fix it? Of course. I still watch them. Really? Oh, sorry, I gotta take this. Now, remember, I"m picking you up bright and early tomorrow. Ok, yeah. All right. I love you. Bye. I could video your practises, you know. I didn"t even realize you were there. Um, thanks but that"s ok. I"m actually very good. I"ve done other sports, even gymnastics. You should think about it. What"re you doing? This is gonna be my next tattoo. Do you want me to draw one on you? No, they-they distract the judges. Only if they can see them. Yeah, sure. Why not, right? Katie was supposed to text me to hang out, but um... she still hasn"t. She"s probably too busy kissing Sasha"s ass. You know, you"re so much more mature than the other girls your age. Do you mean that? That"s why I like you. There. What do you think? She"s beautiful. Vanessa, my mom was a ballerina. No way. Yeah. Yeah, I love it. That"s so crazy. It just... seemed fitting somehow. Yeah. My mom was always there. Every practise, every competition. She helped me prepare, even after she got sick. Being a ballerina, she got it. She got having to be perfect all the time. The jealousy. The backstabbing. Well, doesn"t your dad understand you? Well, he wouldn"t have made me come if he did. Wait, he made you come here? Yeah, I mean, he figured that it was the best thing for me. Hmm. He teaches high school earth science so he"s all about that, mind over matter, you know? Well, he probably wanted to get you out of the house so he could get laid again. Ok, that is gross. It"s true. He has sex. Ok, don"t say that to me ever again. Stop. Well, if you haven"t realized this yet, I have no filter. Yeah, I know, Vanessa. You"re crazy. Seriously. You know, I kind of like it without everyone here. It"s peaceful. Well, we can"t all go running home to daddy. Katie, right? Sasha? May I? Oh, hey, Vanessa. Sure. I"m guessing quinoa is the secret to being a future Olympian? Yeah, right. Uh, college is our last hurrah. We peaked at 16. But not Lisa, right? What, was she bragging about how much better she is than us? No. I mean, she said you guys were good, just not scholarship level. I could have misunderstood. Well, Lisa is lucky to be here. Really? She was in a bad accident last year. Lost her edge. She was having panic attacks, Sasha. That could have been us. Yeah, ok, but we don"t go around talking a big game, do we? Well, it"s a good thing she has her head on right. I mean, most people, when they lose someone important to them, they try and hurt themselves. I "m sorry, it" s none of my business. Did she? I don"t know. Lisa"s a really private person. She wouldn"t always tell me everything. She was pretty messed up, though. That"s why she missed first semester. It got really bad. Vanessa"s really cool, actually. She lost her mom, too, so she kinda knows what I"ve been going through. Hmm. Which is nice. She"s also a January start so we"re kinda lost together in a way I guess you could say. She"s actually gonna start video taping my routines. - What? - Whoa, hey. If I didn"t know any better I would say that this college thing is going pretty well for you. Ok dad, it"s only been a week so you don"t have to say "I told you so" just yet. Me? Have I ever said "I told you so"? Really? Alright, alright, alright. Anyways, it"s kinda been nice because, I don"t know, Katie has been acting kinda weird. She"s kind of ignoring me. That doesn"t sound like Katie. Yeah well, I mean, I get it. She"s rooming with Sasha and Sasha hates me. Lisa, I"ve been thinking, um... you know, uh, maybe on Sunday we could go see Zofia. Zofia? Yeah, if you want. I haven"t seen her since the funeral. Yeah well, you know, we don"t have to. It was just a- No, no, Dad-Dad, I want to. She um, she makes me feel closer to Mom. Yeah, no, I"d love to see Zofia. So what do you feel like doing now? We just did it. We can do it again. Yeah? Mmm-hmm. Hey, Jimmy? Mmm? I"m gonna need you to push my deadline on my tuition. Your folks didn"t send you the money? No. The narcissists went on a safari and I can"t get a hold of them. A safari? As in Africa? Rich girl, hmm? Oooh, what are these? Uh, Addys. Good if you got ADD. Two kinds of amphetamines I like. Yum. They"re fun. Where were we? Right here. She"s so much like Anna. Yeah, she is. Your mother was such an angel. Yeah, I know. She was my best friend. Did I ever tell you that? Yeah, we just talked about that. Remember, Zofia? Remember? They gave me some pills and- Maybe it"s time to rest, Zofia. What? I said maybe it"s time to rest. Oh, right. Right. Rest. I made some terrible mistakes. You need to hold on to who you are, Lisa. Don"t you ever let that slip away. Lisa"s doing the best she can. And she"s doing great. We should go. Mmm? Oh, you are so pretty. You"ll come back and see me, won"t you? Yeah, of course, Zofia. Dad, it makes me sad thinking of her in that place. It"s the best assisted-living home in the state. Your mom made sure of that. It was a good day for her. She"s where she needs to be. Hey, dad? Did-Did you and mom ever worry that I"d get like that? Like after my accident in the gym? Honey, Zofia had paranoid schizophrenia. You had anxiety after a terrible accident. It"s apples and oranges. What about the summer when I couldn"t get out of bed? You had a traumatic year. You were bound to get depressed. We both were. It"s gonna take time, honey. It"s gonna take time for us to put the pieces back together. Yeah, yeah. If that"s even possible. ♪ Your life"s blood flows through my veins ♪ ♪ For all time, we will remain ♪ Like a vice that will not bend ♪ ♪ You and me until the end ♪ That"s beautiful. How was your weekend? It was ok. I watched Katie and Sasha practise. Yeah? I know they"re snotty bitches but they"re actually really amazing. Better than me? No, not at all. I mean, maybe a little less shaky on the beam, but... Wait, shaky? What do you mean, shaky on the beam? Oh my god. Forget I even said anything, honestly. When I"m playing the guitar I just get in my own head and I say weird stuff. Yeah, ok. Um... Hey. How was your weekend? Vanessa said she saw you guys. Yeah, yeah, we uh, hung out a little. So, what? Do you have time for everybody but me? What"re you talking about? Ok, let"s go, Katie. I"m glad you decided to join us for the weekend, Vanessa. Can"t have you stuck on campus. Yeah, Vanessa. Why would you want to hang out with a bunch of young, hot dudes when you can kick it at Matt Carmichael"s house? Oh my, oh my. ♪ So have you always lived in Melverne? Uh, since Lisa was born. Do you have um, family or friends in Washington, Vanessa? Just you two. Oh, my mother loved to dance, too. Don"t show too much interest in those photographs. I"m liable to haul out our home videos. I love home videos, Mr. Carmichael. Hey, dad, no. I know what you"re thinking. They"re nice. They love each other. They"re making me feel very welcome here. But can"t I have just one night where I feel good, and part of a family? Um, hello? Uh, it "s-it" s me, Vanessa. I was-I"m sorry, is everything ok? Uh, yeah. I was just uh, I just got a phone call. Ok. Sorry to interrupt. I pretend she"s my mom. Like her soul got captured somehow. Can I see that? Yeah. The music"s actually from Swan Lake. It was her favourite. Favourite ballet. That"s the scrunchie from it. She actually gave me that scrunchie from the show and promised that it would bring me good luck. I used to wear it every competition but now I just keep it under my pillow and I have to touch it for good luck. Do you ever wonder what it was like for your mom? What do you mean? What it"s like to die. To drift away from all the pain and pressure. I used to think that I"d never be able to live without her. She"s waiting for you up there. Mine, too. Wouldn"t it be so great if we could go see them now? Yeah, it would be. So great. Goodnight, Vanessa. I tried to stay quiet about this but... What? What is it? They were talking so bad about you. I knew it. I knew it. Vanessa, what were they saying? That you"d fall apart if Cynthia put you in a line-up. What? Why? They"re the ones who said it, not me. I don"t know. Well, why would I? Sasha said something about you being scared of having another accident. No, I"m not. Sasha"s such a bitter bitch. She just had to tell you about my accident, didn"t she? Katie did. What? No, Katie doesn"t talk bad about me. Does she? I mean, not as bad as Sasha, but... Vanessa, what-what exactly did-did Katie say? Lisa, I really don"t wanna do this, ok? I like all of you guys. Tell me, please. Katie doesn"t think you should be here. What? Are you kidding me? She was the one that told me to come. Yeah, well now she thinks you"re gonna crack because you don"t have your mom and you"re gonna flip out again. I could help you. We can prove them wrong. Ok. You ok? Yeah. I"m ok. Come here. Girls can be so mean. Yeah, they can be. Laney, my old coach, actually gave me this after my accident. I guess it was a way of helping build up confidence, you know? Before going back in the gym. That should be good. It"s cool, huh? Alright, and... action. Hmm. Was that a little wobbly? You did the exact same thing when the coach was shaking her head. What? She was shaking her head? When? Never mind. Uh, forget I said anything. You wanna take it from the top? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Was that a little wobbly? You did the exact same thing when the coach was shaking her head. Come on, Lisa! They were talking so bad about you. Katie doesn"t think you should be here. She"s a disaster. I don "t know what" s going on with you, Lisa, but fix it before the Inter-squad. I"m about to start making decisions. Vanessa, are you sure you haven"t seen it? Yes, I"m sure. You"re gonna be late. I had it under my pillow. I have to touch it for good luck. Are you seriously gonna miss your first meet over a hair scrunchie? You"re right. You got this. Next up, Lisa Carmichael. Come on, Lisa. You can do it. What a surprise. Good thing it"s only Inter-squad. Come on, Lisa. Lisa! Hey, honey. Wanna grab something to eat? We can-we can talk? I just wanna crawl into bed, Dad. Our history papers, they"re due on Friday and we haven"t finished them. Excuse me, I"m trying to have a conversation with my daughter here. Hey, you don"t have to be rude to her, Dad. She"s the one trying to help. Come on, Vanessa. Let"s go. I"m sorry my dad was so rude, I could die. Would you? Kill yourself? No. Suicide"s way too selfish. Well, I guess. I mean, what about the ones that mess up really bad and they kill themselves to save their parents the shame? I wouldn"t call that selfish, would you? Vanessa, what"re you talking about? I"m just saying, they"re the ones who let their parents down. If they die they spare everyone the humiliation, and there"s nothing selfish about that. Well, wouldn"t you remember if you knocked it on the floor? Well, I had it out to show Vanessa, so maybe? Can"t you just glue her back on or something? Honey, I haven"t found her yet. Hey, Mr. Carmichael. Lisa has to go to practise now so... bye bye. Do you wanna be here, Lisa? To be honest, I didn"t really at first but now I do. Well, you"re not showing it. You started off strong. I had you pegged for two line-ups. I can get back on track, coach. I can and I will. When? Now. Hey. Hey. Hey, look. Lisa, can we talk, please? Why, Katie? Are you tired of talking behind my back? Lisa. Lisa, come on. You just need some more practise. You really should stop going home on weekends. My dad"s all alone, Vanessa. That"s not on you. He"s the one who forced you to come here, do you remember? Yeah, no, you"re right. I"ll tell him not to pick me up this weekend. Ok. Dad! Why didn"t you tell me you were coming? Well, I left you a few messages. I didn"t get any. Really? No. Well, I"m here now. I figured if you"re too busy to come home you could at least have Sunday brunch with me. Of course. We"re going for brunch, ok? Ok. What? I mean, we were just getting started, but... whatever. How much time do you need, honey? Two hours? Longer? Fine. We"ll make it dinner. Ok. Well, we actually have to study the footage. Yeah, you know what, Dad? I-I really can"t afford the time. I"m sorry you had to drive all the way out here. You didn"t know I was coming. We"ll try it another time. Ok. Bye. Bye. Love you. Hey. Oh. Is it that bad, Matt? Laney, thanks for seeing me on such short notice. I haven"t stopped caring about Lisa just because I don"t coach her anymore. Grab a seat? College is stressful, Matt. Especially for freshmen. They"re away from home for the first time without their support system, and student athletes have to juggle their practise with their classes. No, it"s more than that, Laney. The girl controls Lisa. Look, I all but forced her to go. She didn"t wanna do it. She was so vulnerable and... you know, what if I made a terrible mistake? Look, Matt, maybe you could have used a lighter touch, but you thought that sticking with the gymnastics would be what was best for her. We both did. Laney, would you come see her with me? Oh, still got that fighting spirit, I see. Laney, you came to see me! I missed you. I missed you, too. How are you? I"m good. Vanessa, this is Laney, my old coach. Vanessa and I already know each other. What? You do? How"re you doing, Vanessa? I"m good. It"s great to see you. Vanessa was one of my volunteers at regionals last summer. Oh. Let me know if you want to be our videographer again this summer. I will. I"m getting better. Yeah, she is. She"s videotaping all my routines. That"s great. Aw. I miss you so much, I can "t believe you" re here, Laney. Look, I don"t know why she didn"t mention it. She probably didn"t remember you guys. There were lots of other gymnasts there. Plenty of others dads. No. No, Laney, this means something. What does it mean, Matt? I don"t know. I don"t know. I don"t have a clue. Well, you asked for my perspective. I think Lisa"s stressed. But she"s coping. I"ve spoken with her about not over-exerting herself. And as for Vanessa I believe that she is supportive of Lisa. She obviously cares about her, she"s spending her own time helping her. She doesn"t let her out of her sight. Matt, listen. Lisa has left the nest. What she needs now is to spread her wings and you need to let her do that. Two whole pounds. Yeah. Is it really noticeable? Do you want me to lie? You know, a lot of athletes keep their weight down with drugs. Vanessa, we"re not allowed to use drugs. Ok, why don"t you tell that to every other human being here. What are these? Addys. Adderall. Prescription. They help you focus. They"re also really great for metabolism. Vanessa, no one takes these. I don "t know what you" re talking about. Sasha does. Don"t tell her I told you. What? She can get kicked out, Vanessa. Yeah, well, so could you the way you"re going. Mmm? No. Fine. Ok, one week. Just to see what it does. One week. Great. We have Kennedy, Michaela, Sasha, Kaylie, Samira, and Lisa. Well done, girls. You have all worked really hard, it"s paying off. Now, we are going to work harder. Dad, I"m not rambling, I"m just excited. I didn"t even think I"d get on one line-up and now I"m on two? Cynthia says I might even start on bars. Oh, how"s everything at home? Everything"s fine. Look, you"re talking awfully fast. I"m just super stoked. I thought you"d be. Is that a tattoo? It"s a temporary tattoo, dad. Just friggin" relax already! Next up, from the black team, Lisa Carmichael! Just think about your mom when you"re out there. ♪ ♪ Yes! ♪ ♪ You"re practically vibrating. Your pupils are dilated. Lisa, are you on something? I just did fantastic out there and you"re really accusing me- I"m not accusing you... You"re the one who forced me to come here, Dad! Calm down. You"re making a scene. I"m the one making a scene? Are you kidding me? Ok, ok, sleepy head, it"s time for a nap, ok? Lisa! If all you"re gonna do is embarrass me then don"t come at all! You need to take the edge off. No. No more pills. No. Mmm-mmm. Lisa, you have to sleep. Besides, they"re Benzos. They"re not even on the prohibited substance list. Look. See? When are you gonna start listening to me? Don "t worry, I" ll wake you up before English. Wakey wakey, sleepy head. What time is it? You missed English. Again? You fell asleep at your desk and I had to put you to bed. What about my essay? I finished it. You finished it? I mean, it was either that or she was gonna dock you for being late. Here. Pull yourself together. Open. Vanessa, why do you care about me so much? Because you"re like the little sister I never had. What"s wrong? I"m getting these really fluttery feelings in my chest. You"re fine. Do you think I"m having a heart attack? No. Are you sure? Ok, here. Give me your hand. These will help you relax. Just don"t take them until after practise or you"ll crash too soon. You"re fine, I promise. It"s normal. Really? I hope it was ok to call, Mr. Carmichael. No, no. You did the right thing by telling me. - Thanks, Katie. - Sure thing. - Call me any time. - Okay, I will. - Bye. - Bye. Hi Jimmy. You have to make some kind of payment. I can"t keep pushing this deadline for you. Yeah, you can. Vanessa. I"d be so grateful. How grateful? Grateful enough to maybe invite my innocent little roomie Lisa over to your house for a private party? You can invite some friends and it could get interesting. You know I like interesting. You got my candy? Hey, I made it. Ooh, cash outs. You moved Vanessa into my daughter "s room, didn"t you? I have no idea what you"re talking about, man. One phone call and I can have you expelled and arrested. Oh yeah? For what? I don"t know, passing out prescription pills to undergrads? What do you think? Look, man. Vanessa wanted the switch with Lisa"s room. I don"t know why. So fix it. Move Lisa into a new room. I can"t, at this point. Lisa would have to make the request herself. Do you have access to student transcripts here? Yeah. Good. Go to work. Go! Go to work! Wakey wakey, sleepy head. - Where"s Lisa? - She"s busy. You"re giving my daughter pills, aren"t you? That"s ridiculous. What the hell do you want with her? You really have no idea how to care for a daughter without a wife, do you? Is that why you sent her away? Ow. You know, changing rooms isn"t a crime but sexual assault could ruin your career. Dad? What"re you doing here? Get your stuff. You"re coming home this weekend. But I- No buts. Get your stuff. Oh. Your penne pasta. Thank you. Spaghetti and meatballs for you. Ah, terrific. - Thank you. - Bonappetit.Enjoy. Wow. Look at this, right? - It looks awesome. - I know. Dad, I loved our Saturday nights here with mom. It made things feel normal almost, you know? I miss it. Yeah, me too. It was a nice tradition. Yeah. You know, honey, it doesn"t have to stop just because mom"s not here. Yeah. No, you"re right. I just-I don"t know. I wish I felt better. Upset stomach? Yeah, no, I haven"t felt great all day. I don "t-I don" t know what it is. Hmm. Oh! Oh my gosh. Lisa, honey... hey... uh, honey. Yeah, Vanessa, what"s wrong with me? My-My chest is fluttering more than ever and... And my... my head feels like it"s gonna explode. I don "t know what" s going on, I feel so dizzy. What-What"s wrong with me? Withdrawal. You need your pills. You have to come back now or it"ll get worse. Take the number 60 bus. It comes right here. Lisa? Honey? Lisa? Do you feel better? Much. I don"t have to drink that, right? No, silly.

What"re you talking about? Give me this. You look good. You guys are having fun. What is it, Vanessa? It"s you. So when"s the next party? It"s good. What? Who posted this? I don"t know. You don"t know? Which one of you idiots posted this? Chill. We just saw it online. I don"t know who posted it. Chill?! Yo! Bitch! Ignore them. She felt bullied, Matt. That"s probably why she took off on you. You forced her to go home just like you forced her to go there. I don"t sugar coat, you know that. Why do you think I keep coming to you? Do I even wanna know what that is? Vanessa"s transcripts. Oh, come on. You know that"s confidential. How on earth did you... Never mind how, Laney. Look, Lisa"s not stupid. If I can show her concrete proof that Vanessa isn"t who she says she is then maybe she"ll believe me. Ok. Let"s take a look. GED granted in Oregon... Hold on. Looks like she went to school here in Ridgewood - for a couple of months. - Exactly. And she told me she didn"t know anyone in Washington. A 40-something man asking questions about a young woman who is not his daughter won"t get you far. We"re going together. Thank you and we"ll see you next class. You two? Stay. She failed us both for cheating. My GPA is totally screwed and I don"t even care. No, not after the video. It"s totally my fault, Lisa. I should have stayed sober the other night. No. No, I"m doing a great job at destroying my life on my own. Hey! Hey. Look at me. I"m gonna find out which one of Jim"s stupid friends took that video and I"m gonna destroy him. Or I could just destroy myself. That"s another solution. One my mother chose. What? Your mom committed suicide? You never told me that, Vanessa. You never asked. - I"m sorry. - You should be! I"m so selfish, ok? I"m sorry! - You are! - I know! I know, ok?! I hate myself! Ok? Just stop! I wanna die! Hey, come here. She would understand. Your mom. You needed to be with her right now. I know. I know. She wouldn"t be mad at you for doing it. Shh. What is it you wish to know about Vanessa? Well, is there anything you can tell us? That"s a rather vague request. You say Vanessa is currently enrolled at SWU. Are you one of her instructors? Look, I apologize if I was vague, Mrs. Overburton. I am a teacher but not at SWU. Vanessa is my daughter"s roommate. I see. Vanessa exercises an unhealthy amount of control over Lisa. We"re both very concerned. I coached Lisa in high school. Gymnastics. There was a situation. What kind of situation? A male student she was involved with attempted to take his own life. His mother was convinced that Vanessa played a role. Did she? I really don"t know. Can you put me in contact with this boy"s mother, the one that tried to kill himself? - No, I"m not... - Please, Mrs. Overburton. Lisa lost her mother and I "m-I" m doing the best I can but I desperately need help and it sounds like this boy"s mother knows exactly what I"m going through. Please. Hey, Jim. Hey. So listen, I"m gonna need another extension. - My parents are still not back. - I can"t. Of course you can. No. Vanessa, I can"t. If they trace this back to me I could lose my job. Well, you"ll lose it a lot faster if they see a video of you giving drugs to a minor. What"re you talking about? Ooh, this doesn"t look too professional, does it? You wouldn"t do that. Is that a challenge? Please, it"s one more time. They"re not even gonna notice. You"re crazy. Hey, I didn"t mean that. Hey, Vanessa, look at me. Hey. Come on. I didn"t mean that. Ok. Ok? Alright. Yeah? Mmmhmm. Yeah? Oops. Bye. Come on. Lisa. Are you ok? Is there something you wanna tell me, Lisa? Ok, well, there"s been rumours circulating and in light of this video... you"re to report for drug testing 8:00 am sharp tomorrow morning. Ok. Mrs. Stewart? Matt. Call me Maddy. Thanks for coming to see me, Maddy. I couldn"t live with myself if I didn"t. ♪ Like a vice that will not bend ♪ ♪ You and me until the end ♪ You should really tell your dad. Before the school does. And before he sees that video. I can"t. I don"t know what to say. My son, Chris, was a little depressed when he met Vanessa. His girlfriend had just broken up with him. He was grappling with his father"s drinking problem and our divorce, which I was, too. At first I thought Vanessa would be a good thing for him, you know? Pull him out of his head. But that didn"t last very long. It started with little things. She"d convince him to skip track practise. Soon it was alcohol and drugs. Vanessa became obsessed with Chris. She had to be with him every moment. Right up until the minute when she convinced him to slit his wrists. My god. Is he... Oh, he"s good. Look, I know exactly what you"re doing. You"re trying to find something to show your daughter. Some kind of proof to break her from the spell she"s under. Take it from me. Don"t wait for a smoking gun. Vanessa gets into kids" heads. Your daughter probably won"t believe you no matter what you can prove. Take her as far away from Vanessa as you possibly can. By force if necessary. It"s what I wish I had done. Sometimes it"s easier if you write things down. Here. Tell him how sorry you are. How you would rather die than disappoint him. ♪ Your life"s blood flows through my veins ♪ ♪ For all time we will remain ♪ Tell him you love him. ♪ Like a vice that will not bend ♪ ♪ You and me until the end ♪ Why would Vanessa do all this? I had the same questions. I needed answers, so I did some digging. Everything is in here. Luckily I don"t need it anymore. It"s all yours. Vanessa"s mom killed herself so maybe it all stems from that. She was a ballerina. What was her name? Sonja Rudland. What is it? Hello? Katie, it"s Matt. Are you at the dorm? - Yeah. - Look, I don"t have time to explain, but I need you to go to Lisa"s room and you need to get her for me. Lisa! Lisa! Answer! Your dad"s on the phone, he says it"s an emergency! Hello? Lisa! I-I can hear them, Mr. Carmichael, but they won"t answer. Katie, find someone with a key. I"m on my way. It"s time to go. Matt. So what did you find out? Laney, look. It"s worse than I thought. I think I know what to do but I"m gonna need your help. 911, what"s your emergency? Here. We"re gonna show them how amazing you are What... What"s going on, Vanessa? Just trust me, Lisa. We"re going to show everyone you belong on the team. So, so pretty. So you don"t get cold. You got this. And action. Be careful. Be careful. You wouldn"t want to fall. You"re so special. Your dad"s gonna love this. - Lisa! - Stop! You"re just in time for the show. I wouldn"t come too close if I were you. Stay on that line, ok, honey? Just stay on that line. Focus on that, alright? Shut up! Don"t you move! No, please. Please, let her down. She"s all you talk about. Let her down. - I"m your daughter, too! - I know you are! Shh. I know you are, and I love you. I love you. No. You don"t. You don"t know a thing about me. Look, I thought about you every day. Shut up! - It"s ok, honey. - Now it"s time you watch. You wanna see this? Ha ha ha! Amanda, please. Please. What did you call me? What did you call me? Amanda. That"s your name. Amanda is dead! You let her die! Look, you have every right to be angry and I can"t imagine how much you suffered, Amanda, but you don"t know the full story. Lisa got everything. You had the perfect wife, you had the perfect house, you had the perfect daughter. What did I have? I had nothing! Your grandmother, she took you away from me. - She changed your name! - Can you stop? - I never gave up hope. - Lying to me! - Stop! - I"ve carried this with me, everywhere I went, ever since the day your grandmother took you away. But I never gave up hope. Never! It"s true, Amanda. How are you here? You"re dead. I tried to kill us, Amanda. I-I was sick. I couldn"t be your mommy. Amanda, let her go. Please. This has nothing to do with Lisa. Amanda please. Please. No, no! No, please. Don"t! No! No, no, no! Come on! Cut the rope! Oh god, look at me! Breathe! Breathe! No, no, no, no! Lisa look at me! Breathe, breathe, breathe! Look at me! Look at me! I"m here! I got you! Just breathe, breathe. Look at me. It "s ok, it" s ok. You ok? You ok? Look at me. You"re ok. You"re ok. I got you. You "re ok. You" re ok. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. ♪ Your life"s blood flows through my veins ♪ ♪ For all time we will remain ♪ You"re ok, Lisa. You"re ok. You "re ok, hon. You" re ok. I spoke to Cynthia. She says you can rejoin the team if you"d like. Listen, kiddo. I should have told you about Amanda a long time ago and I"m sorry if it had- - Why didn"t you, dad? - I didn"t know how. I didn"t know what to say to you. And I wanted to protect you. I wanted to protect you from everything. Dad, what"s going to happen to her? I don"t know. Amanda has a long road ahead of her. Well, I hope she gets the help she needs, but I"m never going to see her ever again. But I know you have to. A letter for you. "Dearest Amanda, I am so sorry "for how everything turned out. "And I want you to know that I"m here for you. "When you"re ready, I"d like to come visit "and see if we can start again. "Your dad, always."
