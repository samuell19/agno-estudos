(tranquil piano music) (box creaks) - [Jacques Voiceover] So then, I saw something floating in the ocean and jumped in to get it. (typewriter clicking) Suddenly, a wave hit me. I was drowning, and I knew I was going to die, but then, out of nowhere, I was being pulled from the water, and it was just nothing when, it was a famous movie star who happened to be at the beach. He tussled my hair and said, "Take better care "of yourself next time, kid," and then he disappeared. He was gone. And I decided right there that I, too, would work in the movies, and so it began as it always does for people like us: at the bottom. I could not afford tickets, so I worked in a theater. It was hard work, but I got to see all the movies and unlimited amount of the greatest of all foods. Popcorn. - So, here I am now after a lifetime of video ready to succeed in Hollywood. - That's an amazing dream. - Sometimes, dreams is the only thing we have left, no? Did you know that most men have two fears and one wish when they get a seat on an airplane? - Really? - The first one, of course, is that they're not gonna die of a plane crash, you know? They are flying. A-la-la-la-la-la-la. (Jacques screams) Bam! (laughs) - The second? - The second is that they're gonna sit next to a 400-pound dude with bad breath and an amazing disregard for personal space for like 12 hours. - And what, pray tell, is it that they wish for? - That they're gonna sit next to a beautiful woman who's gonna become the love of their life. - Really? - Well, full disclosure, for most men, it is a love of one evening, but not for me. I'm always on the lookout for the one. - How romantic of you. - Born out of romance, existing in illusion, and slain in the tragedy of reality. That is my story in certain words. - Well, at least you've got your log line. - Extras, right? - [Peach] Yeah. - Okay, are you Peach Allure? - That's me. - Head back to 26C. We need to fill in some more seats close to camera. - Okay. It was nice to meet you, Jacques, born of romance and slain of tragedy. (laughs) Maybe I'll see you at lunch? - Yes. Peach Allure? That is an amazing name. I mean it really, and not in the usual Los Angeles way. - Thanks. - You're welcome. See you at lunch. (sighs) Hello, I am Jacques Jeunet. - What the fuck are you looking at? You looking at me? - [Jacques] Yeah. - Why you looking at me? Huh? Don't look at me. - I'm looking there. - Hey! Because, if you look away, I will fucking devour you. - [Jacques] Okay, okay. - You understand that? - I'll just look away. - So don't look at me. - Okay. - Hey! Don't look at me. - I'm looking up. - Don't look at me. - Okay. (chair creaks) - Come on, man. I'm just fucking with you. Ha! Come on. I'm an actor. I'm a method actor, man. Do you know that I have been in character for 27 years, nine months, and six days? I take this shit seriously, and sometimes I'm too serious. - I have these, I - Whoa, whoa, nobody fucking told you to talk! Because, if you speak, I will have to cut off your dick. I'm not crazy, I'm serious. So shut the fuck up. - Okay, that's fine. - Hey, don't worry about it, man. It's all good, it's all good. You know, we're like two dudes on a plane. We're just talking, you know, two macho guys. - I've never met a method actor before. It's rather intense, no? - Yes, yeah, it's rather intense, man. That's the way it is. And, I am not just a method actor. I am very, very special. I am the very motherfucking godmother of method actors, and I bestow upon them great acting ability through trauma and waving my magic dick over desperate actors. - Thank you, but I'm just an extra. - A what? - Extra. - A what? - An extra, I'm not a - You're not an extra! You're an actor! Say it! - I am an actor. - No, no, say it loud with some fucking feeling! I am an actor! - I am an actor! - I mean, do you wanna be an actor? - Yes. - Are you an actor? - Yes. - Then you're not an extra. You can't be an actor and an extra, so "I am an actor!" - I am an actor! - Louder! - I am an actor! - Say it like you mean it, motherfucker! - I am an actor! - Yeah! Now cry like a bitch! (Jacques screams and cries) - You know what you are now? - I'm an actor! - That's right. - I'm an actor! I'm an actor! - Maybe, maybe. Lot of work. A lot of work. (soothing music) - Hey, there. - You are look so beautiful. It's amazing! - Thanks. - So, did Monsieur David get your close-up? - Oh, stop. - Did you see they gave me the James Bond suit? - You look nice. - I know, it's like, "Bonjour, my name is Jeunet. "Jacques Jeunet." - Check out her. - And I'd be one of your Bond girls. - Absolument. - Yoo-hoo! I have another self-tape for you. This time, I kept on all, most, some of my clothes, so. - Fucking stalker, get lost! Get, call security. (footsteps) - You know, I'm serious. One day, your name will be up in light. If you could play any role in any part, what would it be? - Probably the shark in Jaws. Duh-nuh duh-nuh (snarls) - Hi-ya! What a range of emotion. What a performance. - Oh. - I cried for hours. - Oh. - Hey, everybody. - Bonjour. - Don't mean to interrupt rehearsal. I need to talk to you. It's Peach, right? - Yeah. - So listen, I think I can get you upgraded to day player. It's just a teeny part, but if you're interested, I can introduce you to the AD. - That would be amazing. - Well, alright then. Let's go. - See you. - Go get them, tiger! - Dude, so wrong century. - How would you even know? Hey, Peach? Ready? Go! - Hey, Peach, see the AD over there? Head that way, I'll be with you in one second. - Thank you so much. - Okay, ready! - Look. - Jacques Jeunet. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever. Let me save you a Hollywood heartbreak, okay? - Alright. - And you with a girl like that? Friend zone. Forever. - You know, it is only a very lonely and insecure man that considers making a friendship only inadequately small. I feel so sorry for you. - Whatever, dipshit, just get lost. Actually, you know, there's this director. You've probably never heard of him. He made a movie about a killer shark and a boy who befriends an alien. - Yeah, sure. - Well, he has an open casting call in the next few days over on Ventura and Sepulveda, which I think you would be perfect for, (gasps) except you're too old, you're too ugly, and you're too fat. Total fail in every way. - Super. What a lovely man. Not fat. (romantic music) (car horn beeps) - Yes, you. Jacques, born of romance. - Bonsoir, Ms. Allure. - Do you need a lift somewhere? - Doesn't everyone? - I suppose. Well, come on then. Got a suitcase? - Yeah, I'm like, how you say, method that way. - Okay, Mr. Method Man. You know they make suitcases with wheels? - I will try to save up for one of these. - I'm sure you will. Get in. - [Jacques] Alright. - [Peach] It's a little small. - [Jacques] Yeah, it is. - [Peach] Are you hungry? - [Jacques] Yeah, I'm starving. - [Peach] Alright. (engine roars) So, what is your dream really? - Ever since I was a kid, all I ever really wanted to do was act. - Fine. - But I come from kind of a traditional family, so they have other ideas about things. - And they think you're crazy? (laughs) - In a nice way, yeah. - That is the first requirement to be an artist. - Being crazy? - No, to have a dream. - Yeah, I just wish dreams paid the rent. - But they do. Dreams are fueled by hope, and the atomic structure of hope, - Structure. - Structure. Structure. - [Peach] Structure, okay. - Structure. - I love the way you say it. - [Jacques] Yeah, structure. - Okay. - The atomic structure of hope is hard work and persistence, and the chemical byproduct of these two elements is survival. So, did you get that day part? - No, they wanted a brunette. (groans) And I couldn't find a wig that would work, but Davy actually told me to come into the agency and he'd introduce me to some people, and maybe I can get some auditions. - That's nice of him. - Breasts open doors in any town. - So, why? - I absolutely hate it. - Pourquoi? - Sometimes, I smile at people when I just wanna stab them right in the face. Don't be embarrassed. We both know it's true. - Well, to be honest, I am half embarrassed and half terrified. - Why? (laughs) Well, if you're so scared, why are you smiling, huh? - Because it is true that you have many faces. (gasps) - [Jacques] No, but don't hurt me. (laughs) - [Peach] I won't hurt you. - [Jacques] It's just a nice joke, but it is - [Peach] It's okay, you're fine. (Jacques whistles) - Merci beaucoup for the company of your pleasure, mademoiselle. - And thank you for the encouragement, good sir. - It's very nice to have someone to talk to in this town. I hope to see you again. - Are you sure you're okay out here? - Yeah, absolutely. I'm like two or three minutes down the road, no problem. Don't worry. - Okay. Goodnight. - Bonsoir, bonsoir. (door thuds) - Hey, you didn't get my phone number or my email or anything. - No. - Well, how are you gonna get in touch with me? - I will just keep looking for you on the billboards. (laughs) - I don't have a pen or anything. I've got a spare headshot. It's got my number and my email on the back, all my info. Give me a call. We'll get some coffee. - It's perfect. Perfect. Okay. Bye. - Bonne nuit. (car engine revs) (ominous music) - [Man] Who the hell are you? What are you doing knocking on my door? - I've waited my whole life for this moment. - Don't you recognize me? - [Woman] Don't you recognize me? - I've never seen you before in my life. - in my life. - Well, maybe if you look hard enough, you'll recognize a little bit of the face - a little bit of the face - you see in the mirror - you see in the mirror - every day, standing right here before you. - right here before you. - Don't speak to me in subtext. I practically invented subtext. (knocking) I don't have any children, so get out of here before I call the cops. (woman moans) - [Woman] It's me. - Oh, come on, come on, yes, yes, yes! Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on, more, more, more, yes, yes! (crickets chirping) - At least I got breakfast covered. (laughs) (man sighs) - Long day at the office, huh? (laughs) Yeah, me too. I've been walking so much, my hemorrhoids got hemorrhoids, and them motherfuckers got migraines. - Take a seat. (laughs) - Appreciate it. Mighty nice of you. Shit, hell of a day, hm? I don't know about you, but my stomach feels like it's been skull-fucked by a porcupine. - Well, that is an elegant way to put it. - Ain't nothing eloquent about hunger, my friend. A pain by any other name would still smell like a goat's ass. (laughs) - I have something for you. - Yeah? Mm, mm, mmm. - Nice, huh? - Goddamn, man! This tastes better than wet pussy, shit. - Yeah, they had a very good caterer. - Ah, see, I couldn't be a caterer. - Why? - I'd eat all the fucking food. - Oh, my God. - Woo! I tell you, it's colder than a polar bear's left testicle out here, man. - You are full of idiocies, aren't you? - Idioms, motherfucker. - Oh, idioms. - Idioms. Exactly, you got that shit straighter than a wedding night dick. (laughs) (seductive music) - Hey, kitty cat. - Don't look at me like that. - I didn't look at you like anything. - Yes, you did. Look, I just paid my half of the rent so back off. - Katya? I didn't say or do anything. - You don't have to. You just have that disapproving look like my mother used to stab me with. - I am not your mother, and you know I don't look down on what you do. The world sucks, okay? We do what we do to get by. I just want you to stay safe, okay? - Oh, Peach. It's so beautiful that you care about me like that. - Aw, come here. - Aw, yes, yes, Peach! - Get off of me! Ew! - Peach! - You're terrible. - I'm just fucking with you, but, you know, in this way, not in the strap-on kind of way. - Yeah, thanks for clarifying. - That dude is KO'd after two rounds, but I could slip in a little blue magic, and he'd pay extra to go three-for-three. - I'm down for that. - Hey, get your dick back in there. - I'm gonna pass on that offer. Again. - It's a shame. I could teach you the Gershwin technique. - What's that? - You don't know what the Gershwin technique is? Oh, my God. Okay, look at this. - Oh, God. - You get that this is a dick, right? - Mhmm. - A dick? - Yeah, I get it. - Okay. You know how the top part, a little bit more sensitive? - Mhmm. - Mhmm. - Ew. (Katya hums) Gross! Okay, that's good. (Katya moans) Ew, stop! - Okay, and if that's not enough, bloop, bloop. (laughs) Up the tailpipe. Who could ask for anything more? - You know what? You're incorrigible. That means that - I know what the fuck it means. I have Tolstoy on my shelf of pleasure readers, - Oh. right next to The Multi-Orgasmic Woman. - Okay. Oh, wow. - Yep. - Mhmm. - Not bad. - You look like a monkey. - You look like a monkey. - (Peach hoots) (laughs) (snoring) - Ah, Lewis. - Well, good morning. Why you hairy then? What the fuck? (Lewis snores) I said I don't like ranch dressing. (door creaks) (door thuds) - Good morning. Oh, God, you again? What do you want, jackass? - Bonjour, Judy! I would like the usual. - Then it's gonna cost you the usual, jerkoff. - No, Judy, can I talk to your mother? - Do you see my mother, dumbass? No, you don't. And wanna know what I don't see? My money. So show me the dinero, grandpa, or fly like a bird. - Look, sept, huit, neuf, dix. That's your. - Now, don't get me in shit. Room two just left, so I reckon you have an hour. Hippity hop, little rabbit. - You're the best, Judy. - Hey, Jacques! Watch out for the sticky wet spots. - Okay, awkward. - [Lewis] She's a charming little lady. - [Jacques] I know, isn't she sweet? - Mhmm, precious. Fucking spectacular. - It's nice. It's better than last time. Look, there is an actual bed. You know, there's a carpet. We can swim in it, it's so big. No, I like it. I'm gonna take a quick shower. (speaking French) (water running) (sniffs) - Hm. They bought the good lube. (melancholy music) (engine revs) - Bonjour, little dog! How is it going, doggy doggy? (engine revs) Have a great day, and be nice, huh? Don't say bad words to ladies, I count on you. You're a gentleman. (engine revs) Ta-ta, little doggy! (tires screech) (thud) - Damn! Aw, man, you got knocked the fuck out! Didn't your mama tell you to look both ways before you cross the street? Hey, look, I'm gonna get somebody for you. Just hold on, hold tight. - You hit my fucking car, dipshit. Hey, are you listening to me? Oh, fuck. You don't look so good. - I know you. You're the writer. (footsteps) - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you wake up, wake up, wake up. (Jacques groans) Fuck. Let's get up, get up. Up we go. Oh, my God, you could stand to lose a few pounds, buddy. (engine revs) - You're Thomas Speare. - You're an asshole. - You are Thomas Speare. - You're still an asshole. Didn't your mother ever tell you to look both ways, and don't you know it's a felony to jaywalk in LA? - Wait a minute, wait a petit minute. You were drunk. You hit me, okay? I remember. - I was hoping you weren't gonna remember that. Fuck it. - [Jacques] What? This is for horse! This is for horse! - And you, my friend. - [Jacques] No, no. - It's just happy juice. Don't worry, the guy next door won't miss it. He died. - No, no, you're not, this is for horse! - Hold still. Be glad I'm not putting it in your dick. (Jacques groans) There we go. (door thuds) (Jacques screams) Shut the fuck up! (singing in French) (Thomas shushes) (Jacques screams) Just hold on to the fucking pole. (sings in French) (thuds) - [Jacques] Bushes! - You've gotta be fucking kidding me. - I hate what this fucking town has become. All the has-beens, the never-gonna-bes, the wash-ups, they're making it a goddamn clusterfuck. All the corporate cock jobs trying to make everything neat and tidy? Give me a fucking break. - Morty, everybody wants to make the money. Films are an investment. They're a business, and if you don't wanna play with the big boys, there's a lot of great stuff out there in the indie market for you. - I am the big boys. - Try changing, maybe, the attitude a little bit, huh? People these days, they wanna spend money on sure things, predictable outcomes, safe product. - Hollywood ain't about predictability. It's about finding the goddamn gold. Remember when we started? It was the wild fucking West. - Maybe you're just getting a little old. - Hey, honey, do you know who I am? - Of course, Mr. Heran. I have to say, Suitcase Full of Miracles is my absolute favorite movie. I've seen it over and over again. I don't know what it is, I just, I love it so much. - Here you go, honey. Here's a fun coupon. Take the money and get the fuck outta here. You see? I ain't getting old, and you know why? Because I'm fucking immortal, so go fuck yourself. (footsteps) - What an asshole. - [Peach] More coffee, sir? - He's always been an asshole, he's gonna be an asshole. - Well, I'm sure he's not so bad. - Easy for you to say. Now I gotta go find me a new producer. Thanks for the coffee, sweetheart. I really appreciate it. Hey, do you know who I am? - I'm sorry, I'm sure I've seen you somewhere. - Don't worry about it, it doesn't matter. You know you don't know who I am? Because that's never been important to me, only the work has, and don't ever forget that, okay? People get caught up in the nonsense. It's a shame, lot of talented people out there, lost in the nonsense. Have a great day. - Thank you. Bye, see you next time. - Well, I'm sure one day you'll manage not to fumble at the one-yard line. Better watch the clock, sugar, or you're gonna be late. - Oh, shit. Oh, here. Tickets to the movies. - No, Peach, no. I don't accept. - Is anybody home? Ah, bonjour, Lewis. - Well, well, well, if it ain't my favorite crash-test dummy. - I did not expect you to be up so early. - Well, I didn't expect your ass to get hit by a car either. (speaking French) Because we both surprised. Anyways, look, your man's outside. You need to go talk to him. Just try not to be an idiot. - Just so you know, what you're holding in your hand is not really made for what you're doing with it. - Oh, yeah? You keep talking shit and I'll find a place to stick it. - Bonjour, Thomas. - Fuck off, I'm still angry at you. - You hit me, remember? - You interrupted my destiny. - Pardon? - There I was, finally worked up the courage, all sauced up in my favorite ride ready to crash into a wall at a hundred miles an hour, goodbye, fucking world, and you just show up. - You're welcome. - Wrong! I tire of this mortal coil. I wish to shed this meat jacket and fly forward into oblivion. (Thomas groans) (Thomas screams) (water splashes) - Thomas? Thomas? Thomas? Thomas? Lewis! Lewis! Call 911! Police! He's not coming out! He's drowning! I can't, I don't know how to swim! Thomas! Thomas! Lewis! - We got plenty of white folks around, and we sure as hell ain't gonna miss that one. - Man, man, I have to save him. - Ah, good luck with that. (upbeat music) - Hi! - Hi. - Hi. - Here's my headshot. - Okay, put it there. - Okay there you go. Nice to meet you. - Oh, honey, we don't do that. It's okay, thank you. - Sorry. - Oh, no, please stand. And turn. - This way? - Yes, and turn the other way, no, no, the other way, and let's see your backside. - Excuse me? - Face the window, please. Hm, okay. - Okay. - Left leg up. - And now your arm up. Turn your head the other way. - This way? - The other way. Good. It's kinda hard to balance. - It's okay, I know. - You're an actress. (laughs) Thank you. - Mhmm. - Okay, whenever you're ready. - Okay. (sighs) Mm, Scabby's Cat Food, so delicious. - Can you try to do with more emotion, please? - Okay. Mmm, Scabby's Cat Food, so delicious! - Can you do that a little less constipated? - Mmm, Scabby's Cat Food, so delicious! - You're clearly not from around here. You just don't have that Hollywood feel to you. - Well, that is insulting. Why would you presume such a thing about a person? - You gonna sue me? - [Jacques] No. - Not from around here. What's rule number one of Hollywood? - Be talented? - Fuck off. Have a good lawyer, and that's kindergarten-level shit, Mr. Not-From-Around-Here. - [Man] Scabby's. - Scabby's Cat Food, so delicious. (beatboxes) Scabby's Cat Food, so delicious! Mmm, Scabby's Cat Food, so delicious. (meows) Scabby's Cat Food, so delicious. (meows) - [Man] Cats don't talk. - Oh, I thought you wanted me to say the line. - [Man] I do, I do, in cat talk. - I really meant what I said. Your movie was amazing. - Thanks. Yeah, I guess it didn't suck. - Why don't you write another one? - I did. Sold all three of them for a lot more money, but I gambled it away. (belches) They're locked in a filing cabinet somewhere, never to see the light of day because I fucked the wrong person's wife or sister, I don't know, I was seeing double. - How could you not know? - I'm a writer. - And? - Do you know how to say that in Latin? - No. French, but not Latin. (smacks lips) (speaking Latin) (speaks French) - Let me translate: rarely fucking sober. You don't even get writers' jokes. You definitely aren't Hollywood. - I got it. So exciting! Okay, let's put it in that way, okay? Could you, like, play to be, like, an Asian woman to pretending that you are a white woman, but say pretty please. (clicks lips) - I love that. That's great, yes. (laughs) - Mmm, Scabby's Cat Food, so delicious. (meows) - What type of Asian was that? - I came here to make movies, and I'm gonna star in one one day. - If I had a penny every time I heard that. - You'd be rich. - Look, you got nothing. You're just a homeless chump with a dream in a city full of homeless chumps with dreams, alright? I hate to break it to you, sister, but fame ain't coming your way. - I never said I wanted to have fame. I just want to be in movies. - So, what, what are you saying? That I'm projecting my - I must thank you for your charity, Thomas, but I have somewhere to be. - You got nowhere to be, sit the fuck down. - You are an amazing writer. How can you write words that inspire so many people to dream when you're not willing to fight for your own? I bid you (speaking French), Monsieur Thomas. - Do it again, this time, with a little bit of Russian. - Yeah, but when you do Russian, when you say, "So good," I wanna hear the accent of Russian. - Scabby's Cat Food, so delicious. - Good. - Good. So good. - Good. - Good. (muttering) - Okay. Okay, we'll let you know. - Have a great day. - Bye. Don't call us, we call you. - Look, I'm sorry I hit you. You can't stay here, but I've got a place you can stay for as long as you like, at least until you're healthy. - I've been through worse, but thank you so much. - I don't know how long you'll be able to reach me at that number, either, but, if you need something, call. - Ring, ring, ring, pick up. - [Thomas] What the fuck are you doing? - Pick up. Ring, ring. - Hello, destiny, is this you? - No, it's Jacques, the homeless, not-from-Hollywood Jeunet. The world needs another great story from you, Thomas. Au revoir. (door thuds) - No call back, huh? Don't worry, it'll stop stinging after a while, then you just sort of get used to it. - Actually, I'm waiting for a call from someone else. - You? Ms. I-Don't-Want-Attachments expecting a call from a someone? Interesting. - It's not like that, Wanda. - Mhmm, it never is. Just remember, career isn't everything, okay? Girl, you even got family in this business, but you're too afraid to talk to them. - [Peach] I know what you're gonna say, but - No, - I've just tried. - When life sends you a message, you should listen. I know it's hard giving up on a dream, but sometimes, you just gotta find another dream, in some ways, a better one. Anyway, here. They were able to help me. Maybe they can help you, too. - Thanks. - Bonjour. - [Woman] Yeah, come in. - Bonjour, I'm here for the casting call. - Oh, you know what? We just finished. - Oh. - I'm sorry. Maybe we can make an exception. We can take one more. - Oh, thank you so much. - [Woman] Yeah. - [Woman] Sure. - Merci beaucoup. - [Woman] Now, did you bring your daughter? - No? - You do know that we're casting for a 15-year-old girl, right? - I don't know. I didn't know, no. - Oh, no. You got casting cranked. Don't worry, it happens all the time. - Mhmm, yeah. - Hey, you look really terrible, though, like you-should-be-in-a-hospital terrible. What are you doing here? - Trying to do an audition with one of the greatest directors of all times. This is probably the only thing that could stop me from trying. - Yeah, but what happened? I mean, you look half-dead already. - I got hit by a drunken suicidal writer driving a Porsche, who took me then to the hospital, drugged me with morphine, and then smuggled me out of the precinct for report. No big deal. - So Hollywood cliche. I don't know how people like this get licenses. - I know, right. You know what? I admire your spunk, Mr.? - Jacques Jeunet. - Oh. - Wow, are you related to the French director? - No, I'm not, I'm sorry, but at least I got to meet two beautiful woman. Thank you so much for your time. - [Woman] Thank you. - Hey, wait, Jacques. - Yes? - Look, get some rest, get yourself cleaned up, and give this place a visit. They can be a really great networking place for people who are a little over-passionate about acting. - Okay, merci beaucoup, thank you so much, thank you. - [Woman] Thanks. - [Woman] Oh, Jacques. - Yes? - Do you need a ride to the hospital? - Oh, no, no, no, don't worry, don't worry, no. It feel worse than it looks. I'm just a few minutes away, no problem, I can walk. Thank you. Bonsoir, ladies. Au revoir. - [Woman] Bye. - [Woman] Bye. - Bye-bye. (crickets chirping) - You got something for me? - You only want me for my food, huh? - Look, you still damn fine company, bitch. Don't be so sensitive. - I've got a little French surprise for you. - What you got? - Ta-da. - Oh, yeah. (sniffs) Ah, yes, indeed. Smells like Dijon mustard. (laughs) It's that fancy shit. - Yeah, Dijon is very nice. - Let me ask you something. - Hm? - What you doing here, man? I mean, yeah, the view is nice. - Yeah, come on. - The view is a whole lot nicer from the penthouse of the Biltmore, know what I'm saying? - Yeah, but, more money, huh? I don't have the money. - You ain't hearing me. Check that downright ridiculous dumpster-level fucking suitcase that you carrying around. - You're talking about this amazing suitcase? - Yeah, that piece of shit. Look inside. - Lewis, I had a hard day. - Open the bag before I dick-punch you. - Ready? - Yeah. (sighs) Mhmm, mhmm. - Where is her headshot? - The headshot? Fuck the headshot, - Yeah, what'd you do? - look for the envelope, man. - What'd you do? There's no envelope. - Hm, see? Yeah. - Sorry, Thomas Speare. He gave me money. - Exactly. We rich, motherfucker, come on, man! It's time to pimp our crib, upgrade the lifestyle. (sighs) You know what this means, right? - That means I'm not gonna be able to call her or talk to her or email her or, I have no more way to contact her. - God, we ain't talking about the girl. This means you can buy me some motherfucking sushi, and I don't have to eat this shit anymore. - No, no, no, not yet, not yet, no, no. - Not yet? - No, not yet. - What? Why not? - No. - It's the perfect time. - Sushi. - Sushi's that way. - Hi, Kit Kat. - Hi, Peach. Damn, girl, looks like an all-you-can-eat buffet. And why you like that? You can get big bucks for just a day's work. I'd fuck you. - Thanks, but you know my answer. - Look, I'm not trying to be pushy, but you're a total MILF, and I know a guy that shoots some really nice-looking stuff, goes easy on the girls and pays real well. - The answer's still no. - The offer still stands, 3,500 bucks, more depending on what you'd be willing to do. - I appreciate it, I really do, but if I did that, I'd have to give up on the rest. - That's not true, worked out great for Sasha. - The adult film star? She did one movie. - And how many have you done? I'm sorry, that was totally uncalled for. - No, it's okay. It's just close to that time of the month. - Oh, I have some spare pads if you need them. - No, I mean the rent. - Oh, Peach, I can't cover you for another month. I really wish I could, but I just paid make-up school, and this time, I'm really going for it. - Yeah, it's okay. I'll figure something out. - Girl, I don't understand you. I've got easy money for you. It's 3,500 bucks, take it. - It's not easy money, though, Kat. I'm not built like you. I'm just not as young as you, and I just, I can't. - It's just sex, Peach. - I gotta run. I'll figure something out. - Alright, but think about it, okay? It's two months rent for one day's work. Think about it. (footsteps) Although the work has definitely spoiled the appeal of vegetables for me. - Give it up, dumbass. It ain't here. - But it has to be here. - Look, I recommend a good night's rest and a five-star hotel. Now, preferably one that serves fresh ahi tuna sushi, and we'll come back in the morning, hm? - Right, right. It's gonna be easier in daylight. - Exactly, of course I'm right. Man, I'm a fucking genius. Hey, where you going? - Home. - Home? I don't fucking live in this motherfucker, come on, man. (door creaks) Aw, hell. What fucking part of five motherfucking stars did you not fucking understand? - Waste not, want not. - Shit. Man, it's Hollywood, okay? That means you gotta be seen, be noticed, be someone. - But I am someone. - Oh. Okay, someone, why don't you watch out for that cum stain? Yeah, exactly. Shit is fucking disgusting. - I'm never gonna find her, am I? My first friend in Hollywood. - Aw, man, there's plenty of willing friends to be had for a few Benjamins, you know what I'm saying? - I'm not interested in her that way. I just don't have any friends. - You know, I got feelings, too, motherfucker, damn. - I'm sorry. I meant I don't have many friends. - Ugh, so damn melodramatic, shit. You need to believe in Hollywood a little bit more, you know what I mean? You know, fate, destiny, kismet, deus ex machina, unlikely third act plot twist and stupid coincidences that forward the story along but don't really make sense. That sort of shit. - I have been unlucky my entire life. Why should I believe it's gonna change now? - Because you're in Hollywood now, motherfucker. This is la-la land, the dream factory, alright? And if you can't believe in your dreams, then you best believe nobody else is either. - Hm. Okay, so what do you want me to do? - You gonna make me do all the fucking work? - Mhmm. - Okay, fine, just look in your pocket. - The Hollywouldn'ts? - Mhmm. - You think I should go? Okay, I can. We'll do that tomorrow. By the way, Lewis, thank you for your help. - Yeah, yeah. Now, my happy ending. - Lewis, are you jacking off or what? - What? Don't be jealous, motherfucker. You got a hand and a dick just like I do. Go to work. - Okay, okay, just don't have a heart attack, okay? - Fuck you, man. If you keep talking shit, you're gonna wake up with a dick in your ass. (sighs) (melancholy music) Man, what are you doing walking around with this coffin? - Hey, who knows where we're gonna sleep tonight? - Well, it should be the Hilton. I mean, it ain't that hard to spell, motherfucker. It's H-I-L-T-A-N. - I see you spell as good in English as I do. - Whatever, it's still right. - I'll see you later. - Nah, don't worry, I'll be out here. So, have you got your daily recommended value of chocolate milk? - Welcome to this week's gathering of The Hollywouldn'ts. (audience applauds) So, who wouldn't accept rejection? - [All] We wouldn't! - Of course not. And who wouldn't give up on their dreams of silver screen glory? - [All] We wouldn't! - And who wouldn't blow a casting director to land a major role in a multi-million dollar blockbuster? - We wouldn't! - So let's get started. - Hi, everyone, I'm Irving. - [All] Hi, Irving. - I'm addicted to Hollywood. I really wanna make movies but I have no confidence. - What a nerd. Just go home, you idiot. - Hey, hey, none of that shit in here. No, this is holy ground. You leave that Hollywood negativity at the door or you go the fuck home. Apologize. - Irving, I'm sorry, and Stella, I apologize. - Thank you for sorting that out for us, Stella. Alright, next? - My name's William. - [All] Hello, William. - I'm addicted to Hollywood. My dream is to be a very famous and successful writer. - So why are you here, William? - My biggest problem as a writer is having to rely on coincidence, you know? For instance, I'm just standing there, and out of nowhere, some beautiful girl falls into my arms and ends up being the love of my life, and I just keep waiting on that call, I keep waiting on that email, hoping my life is gonna change. - So, what do you do right now? - I serve coffee. - Exactly. You serve coffee, and you need to accept that. You can't live real life searching for some fantasy. That email, that phone call you think is gonna change your life, it's never gonna come, and only when you accept that can you start to rebuild your life outside of Hollywood and never look back. Okay, who's next? - Hi, my name's Stella. - [All] Hi, Stella. - Hi, Stella. - I'm addicted to Hollywood, and my dream is to be an amazing assistant director. - So it's this new Tempur Pedic cardboard that I got. Hey! Hey, man! Where you going? - That was so depressing. - Why you leaving like a bitch? You don't like it, do something about it. - What do you want me to do? Tell them not to lay down and die? - I don't know, okay? What I do know is the world would be an infinitely better place if people stopped walking by opportunities to help each other. Karma, motherfucker. Go earn some. - Hey, was that Peach? - I don't fucking know. What am I, your fairy godmother? Shit. - Next, yes. - Hi, my name is Jessie. - [All] Hi, Jessie. - I'm addicted to Hollywood, and my dream is, was to be an actress, but I'm finding the concept of giving up very difficult. - It's not about giving up. (inspirational music) The first step is acceptance. You see, we all need to accept the fact that, for whatever reason, our dreams just didn't work out, but you can't spend your life wasting away addicted to a dream that was never meant to happen. You can't keep torturing yourself thinking things are just going to magically work out. - Hey, watch out! Jerk. Oh, you're cute. - Thank you. - This is depressing. You wanna go grab a drink? - Yeah, I do. Bye, everyone. - Hey, Peach. - Hi, Jacques. - Excusez-moi, - Gloria. - Gloria. Have you ever thought odd about what you're doing? Sitting here and taking money from these people to tell them their dream is impossible. - Now, hang on a second. - No, I'm not finished, I'm not finished. Maybe you've never been in a movie or worked in a movie in your life. Maybe you failed. I don't know what happened, but trying to feel better about it by bringing everybody down. You, Jessie. You could be an amazing actress. You have everything that it takes to pull off some great roles. - Me? - Yes! Absolument! And you, Stella. I am sure there is a director somewhere in Hollywood desperate to find somebody as talented and determined as you are to be the first lady. And you, Peach? You're gonna be a star. I know it. And all of you - Excuse me, but just who are you and what are you doing here? - Jeneut. Jacques Jeneut. (gasps) Not John. Jacques Jeunet. - Oh. - I am addicted to films, and I came to you to make movie. I am making this movie, and you are all invited to participate, even you, Gloria. (laughs) - With what? Huh? What do you have? You have your financing? - No. - How about a director? - Not yet, but coming. - Well, do you have anything at all other than your little dream? - No, but sometimes dreams is the only thing you need. It's very important. I am making a movie. Who is with me? - I can act! - I'll be your AD! - I can be a character actress. I mean, if that's okay with you, because I can also do costumes. - You will be amazing. - I could be your script supervisor. - And to the rest of you, I wish you good luck. - I'd like to propose a toast to what you said earlier. - To Tinseltown. - To Tinseltown. - To Tinseltown. - To Tinseltown. - To the generous business owners who give us breaks for auditions and the risk takers, to the people who finally made it big yet still help those of us who haven't, to the parents who worked their fingers to the bone to give their kid a chance, a shot, no matter how faint, and who never said, "Give up," but said, "Do it," like it's the only thing in the world that matters, to the struggling actors and the starving artists who pursue their dreams long past reason, long past hope, and to the people who invite us into their homes when that passion for what we love couldn't pay the rent. I think we all know that, sometimes, the hardest thing is holding onto our dreams, to be rejected time and time again and not let it crush our spirits or drive us to suicide, to try so hard so many times and still be able to look in the mirror and smile and say quietly, "Next time, next time." (laughs) We are the Hollywouldn'ts, the ones who, who wouldn't accept failure, who wouldn't give up on our dreams, and to the ones who love us who wouldn't let us give up on ourselves either. To the Hollywouldn'ts. - To the Hollywouldn'ts. (dramatic music) (Gloria claps) - Wonderful. Truly heartwarming. I'm sure it'll land you Best Toast at next year's Oscars. - Hey, Gloria. - So, is everyone feeling inspired? Well, enjoy it while it lasts. Just look at all of you, so desperate to believe, and what are you going to do tomorrow when you wake up to reality, hm? You come here, and you give them false hope. Well, I nearly drank myself to death at that bar over there until I found a way out of the pain. - Gloria, I think that - Don't interrupt my monologue. Just look at all of them. You're all just right back in it again, right back where you started. For years, I have been there for you. I've been there for all of you. I've held you while you cried. So fine, you wanna go make a movie with him? Go! But just remember, when it doesn't happen, I am not your safety net anymore, so, best of luck to you all. - Well, damn, she just dick-slapped the hope off all your faces. Mm, mm, mm. - Gloria, Gloria, wait. There is another way. - Maybe, but not today. - Thanks, Jacques. It was nice meeting you. - Don't listen to her. It's just her heart broken talking. - We like you, Jacques, and we were all like you years ago. You'll see. - I like you, too. - Good luck. - Bye, Jacques. - Au revoir. - Well, that was cheery. Another round? - Two Pisses in a Bottle and a Catholic High School Girl in Trouble. - A what? - So, cranberry juice with a little class in it. - Oh, merci. - I always wanna quit, but I just love it so much, yet the security of a steady paycheck would be nice. - Yeah. Honey, happiness is doing what you love. Bliss is getting paid for it, okay? Never confuse the two. Sure, we all want bliss, but most of us would settle for happiness. - Or a blowjob. - And, don't tell anybody, but I designed and rent Hollywood's top gossip site. - What is that? - The real celebrity bullshit. - Plenty of that. - I know people that know people that ruin people, know what I'm saying? So, my point is is that I know these celebrities, and their bullshit and their talent, and you've got what it takes. - Okay, so let's make a movie. - Okay, so let's go make one. - It's not that easy. We just lost our crew. - Fucking bummer, man. - Sure it is. You just need a good script. If you got that, the rest will come. - We need money, we need a producer, - Director of photography, - other actors, we need a - make-up, script supervisor - stuntman, composer, - The sound guy. Don't forget the sound guy. - Excuses. You be the producer, you be the star. You wanna make a movie? Go make one. You know, make up a story, start telling people about it. If it's really good, then they'll get excited about it - That's right. - and you'll have your people! - Okay. - Stella's law of story goodness, okay? The heat of a story and the gravitational pull of talent to it is directly proportional to how good it is. - Oh, Stella. - In France, this means something else, just so you know. - Oh, in America, it's a good thing. - In America, it means fucking. (laughs) - Look, do you wanna make a movie? Stop making excuses. - Yeah, dick. - Find a story, find a writer to make it into a script, and then, let's make the damn movie. - Make the damn movie. - Look, this is Hollywood, damn it. It is an organism that exists to make movies, okay? Give it a chance, take some risks, you'll see. - Okay, to no excuse, a bad excuse. - No excuses! - No excuses! - Fuck yeah, you know what this movie needs? Vampires or zombies, you know? It's so fucking hot right now. - Who are you again? - I'm your bartender, but I got a really good script if you wanna read it. - You're awesome, Jacques. - No, I'm just Jacques, and I got a great idea, and Stella, you are in no shape for driving. - I'm shaped perfection for driving. - No, no, no. - What? - Let's make our movie. - Movie! - Now? - Now! - Tonight. - Tonight. - How? - How? - I want your to meet someone. - Someone! - Is it someone special? - Special! - Oh! - He hit, He hit me with a Porsche. - Porsche? - He hit you? - Yes. I'll explain you in the car. - I'll drive. - Drive. (engine revs) - Hey, hey! Well, that's just great. What about me, you crouton-eating cocksucker? My hemorrhoids, man. - This is a nice house. - Seriously, who lives here? What are we doing here? - Hang on, it's a surprise. (door thuds) (crickets chirping) (knocking) - Good evening, sir. May I help you? - Bonsoir. Jacques Jeunet for Thomas Speare. - Shh, we don't say that name around here, out loud at least, and if he were here, which he isn't, I would certainly know. The family's been in Moscow all week, so no, he's not here. (gun fires) Perhaps Mr. Speare is here after all. (fast upbeat music) - Did a naked man just run by the car? (door thuds) - Follow that underwear. - Underwear! (gun fires) - [All] Ah! - Go, go, go go! - Go, go, go! - Stay away from my sister, hear? If I see you again, (speaking Russian) - He kidnapped you at the hospital, really? You need to report it to the police. - No, no, no, no, it was awesome. You know who it was? - It doesn't matter. - Thomas Speare. - The writer? - Oui! Yes! - Definitely call the police. - What are you talking about? He could be our writer. - Man, do you even Internet? - I watch Haji Cuaron. - The YouTube movie review guy? That's it? - Pretty much. - How do you live in this century, Jacques? - Like this. - I feel like shit by the way. Early-onset hangover syndrome. - Oh, drink the coffee. - No way. - Okay, tell me everything that you know. - Okay, look. You ever wonder why he hasn't been writing recently? - He told me he had some kind of affair. - What? No, no. Well, apparently, the mob made a bet. - The mob? - Yes, the mob made a bet on him winning the Oscar, but he lost, so he went crazy after he lost. He did this binge up in Vegas, and then he disappeared off the face of the Earth, probably in the bottom of a bottle. Anyways, they found them, and this big, ugly Mafia guy says that if he ever writes again, he's gonna cut off all his fingers and probably his balls and kill anyone who tries to produce the script. - I think this guy was a little bit overreacting. - It was a lot of money apparently. - So what was the affair? - Maybe he slept with his sister or his wife, rumor's not really clear on that part. (laughs) He was a writer, so, for all we know, it was both. - Yeah, that part I know. - You need to stay away from him, please. - He needs help. - What he needs is a new career. There is a film festival at the expo center tomorrow. Go find us a director and a writer who can keep his pants on. - No, no, no. - Speare is a pipe dream. Move on! - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I am not willing to give up on him. - He did that himself a long time ago. Taxi's that way. Night again! - Bonne nuit. - So, where should I take you? - Oh, it's okay, I'm gonna get a cab. Go home, I'll call you. - Look, Jacques, I'm really excited about the idea of making a movie, but I still have to pay my rent, so I'm gonna have to do it in between things. - Here is my case full of miracles. - What's that for? - The remain cost. See if you can find a cameraman and some guy. I will get a director and deal with the writer. - I can't take that. - Look, I believe in you. I'm investing in you. You are going to be a star. You are already amazing. The world just doesn't know it yet. Take it, please. - Okay, thanks. - Just promise me that if I can get this whole thing together, you'll be my star in the movie. It's gonna be filled with action and adventure and drama. - No romance? - I have not completely worked out the story yet. - Every great story has a love interest. - Done. There will be a love interest. - Goodnight, Jacques. Not really into famous ingenue, born of romance, existing in illusions, and slain by the tragedy of reality. - Goodnight, Peach, soon to be a huge movie star, Allure. - Oh! - I'm sorry. - The French, okay. Bye. (engine revs) - First, you leave my ass back at the bar, and now, you give away all our money. What the fuck, man? And where are we supposed to sleep? What are we supposed to eat, hm? (bell dings) - Oh. - Here you go, sir. - Merci. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Lewis, I need a payphone. (laughs) - And how the fuck you plan to pay for it, with bad business decisions? You ain't got no money. - I got your sushi. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. Yes, I did. - You sneaky French motherfucker, goddamn! Why didn't you say something? Shit, there's one up around the corner, let's go. - Okay, (speaking French) - What? Yeah, that shit, too. (grunts) (crickets chirping) (sighs) (cell phone buzzes) - What the fuck? Who the fuck is this? - Hey, Thomas! Yeah, it's Jacques Jeunet. I wanna come and see you, where are you? - Fuck you, again. Why do you keep interrupting in the middle of something? (cell phone thuds) (payphone thuds) - We gotta get after him and see him in person. - Fuck that shit, I'm about to eat my damn sushi. - Goodbye, cruel world. (thuds) Well, that didn't go as expected. - [Katya] More, more, more, more, yes, yes, yeah! (door knocking) You're about 10 minutes late, and let me tell you, I could have used some help in there. - Here's my half. - Oh, shit, hey, nice! Who'd you blow? - Oh, come on, a producer gave it to me to work on a film we're getting started. - That sounds like bullshit to me. He wants you to blow him, or is it a she? I can teach you the Ukraine scissor technique. (Katya moans) - You have a one-track mind. Hey, can I ask you an odd question? - You have no idea what registers as odd to me. - You've done a lot of videos, right? - Porn, Peach. Say the word like a big girl: porn! - Fine, porn videos. I need to ask you about a DP. - Now you're talking my language, sister. What do you wanna know? Spill you fast - No, no, the DP. The DP? The director of photography? - Oh, not at all what I was thinking. - Okay, in all of your shooting, did you ever work with a really great cameraman? - In a totally different way than expected, that is not a question. You're totally fucking serious, aren't you? Un-fucking-believable. - Festivals are amazing. Look at all these people in love for movies. It's gonna be finger in the nose to find a director. - A what? - Finger in the nose. - Why you putting your fingers in your nose? - French expression, it means piece of cake. - Wait, the French eat cake with their nose, with their fingers? - I'm gonna find a director. - So, how many no's was that? That's gotta be some kind of world record you're working on. I mean, it's like you were walking through the desert and found a no-asis. (laughs) - It's not funny. I thought this, and I saw the directors, so I wanted to die. - Oh, Jacques, grow the fuck up, man. Directors want two things. They want finance and security, and you have neither. Look, here's a hint, man. The next time a director asks if you got financing in place, just do what everybody else does and lie. - I am not gonna do this with, please hear me out. This whole thing was a waste of time. Come on, let's go. - Hold the fuck on, damn. Before you lose your boner for this whole movie fixation you got, let me give you a suggestion. Wanna hear it? - I would be honored. - Alright, you don't need somebody who's already directed. You need somebody who's trying to direct. That way, they're gonna be a whole lot hungrier, you know what I'm saying? You know, it's kind of like when you have a guy who hasn't been laid in a long time. He'll fuck anything with a hole. Doesn't matter. But a dude who just fucked a supermodel? Aw, no. He's walking around and he's got brass balls and a diamond dick. He doesn't have time for it, you know what I'm saying? - I get the concept, but what do you want me to do? - There you go. - Lewis, Lewis, - Mhmm. - I love you. (birds chirping) Are you Roger Kuran from Deep Focus Review? - What's that? - I can't believe you're here. You are the best film critic in the world. - Well, thank you. I have to be going. - Oh, can I walk with you? - It's a free country. - Yeah, I know. I just don't wanna be presumptuous or odd. - You're not from around here, are you? - Everybody keeps saying that like it is a bad thing. - Ha! Alright, alright, so how can I help you? (cars honking) - How do you know his class is getting out now? How do you know that's his car? - I blew a guy that knew a guy. - That's reliable information then. - You have no idea. Hey, there he is, Nick! - Uh, hello. Do I know you? Oh, shit. I mean, I don't know you. I'm sorry, I have to leave. I don't do that. If I were to, it would be with you two, but I don't, I'm sorry. If you need a cameraman, you're gonna have to look somewhere else. - Hold on a second, we just wanna talk. - If you don't stop and talk to us like a grown man, I'm gonna go tell your professors what you did. - Okay, okay. It was a mistake. I just, I was so desperate, and I didn't know it was gonna be that. - Yeah, well you're an idiot. You're the only person I've ever met that made a porn film look so good they wouldn't even show it. Honestly, I didn't know I had such a beautiful vagina. - Huh? - But I'm sure you beat off to it like a hundred times. - Hey, I gave you all of the footage. Most of the footage. - Look, I know what the fuck I'm doing here, but she, she needs your help, and if you give it to her, our little secret will stay our little secret. - Oh, thank you, thank you. I just, I really just wanna put this whole experience behind me. - Seriously? Get over it and go get laid. - Thank you, Katya. Hi, Nick. Nice to meet you, my name's Peach Allure, and I have a friend that wants to make a movie, a real movie. - Hey, you hurt me. - I thought you liked that. - Hey, look at you, touche. - Damn it, Jacques, I'm a critic, not a director. - Direct my film, please. You would be amazing. - You're not gonna take no for answer, are you? - Everybody wants to have a great director. You would be great, you are great. Now the world just needs to see it. - Alright, let's say I agree. How are you gonna finance this? - I don't know yet. - So, I have to get going now. It's been nice meeting you. - I have a writer. - What cafe does he work out of? I'm sorry, you didn't deserve that. Do I know him? - Thomas Speare. - Thomas Speare? - Thomas Speare. - I didn't know he sorted out that thing with the mob. Hm, well, if you're serious about this and he has got a script, send it to me, we'll talk. - Perfect. You are gonna direct my film, I can feel it. - Perhaps. Good day, my friend. - Au revoir. Hey, Lewis, you are the best. I got a director, thanks to you, my friend. You are amazing. - Yep, that was pretty impressive, I gotta say. That was some real progress, motherfucker, lying about the writer that you don't have yet. That has to be, unquestionably, the most Hollywood shit I've seen you do all day. Now, you just gotta get busted on Sunset Boulevard with an eight-ball of coke and a couple trannies, and you ready for the Oscars. - I do have a writer. He doesn't quite know it yet, but he will. - If you can find him. - When he find him. - And he's still alive. - Yeah, sure, of course. - Only one way to find out. - Yes. - Are we shooting on a C500, Yari, Red Epic, Red Dragon? Please, please, please don't tell me we're shooting on a DSLR. - I have no idea what you just said. - Yeah, I never heard of any of those positions, either. - What I need is your phone number and your demo reel to show to the producer. (laughs) - Are you serious? - Deadly serious. (laughs) - Oh, my God, this kid needs to get laid so bad. - I'll email you the info. - Maybe he's gay. - This is exciting! We have a DP! - When you say that, it gets me all excited, and then I remember you mean director of photography. - Well, let's go get our sound guy. - That sounds boring. - Well, he does hold long, hard poles. - Now you're talking my language, sister. - Yeah, that's great, but we still got holes in the crew. I mean, how are you gonna fill them? - Yeah, I know, I know, we have to solve that. We still have to solve the issue with Thomas. - Exactly, I mean, aw, would you look at this crazy-looking motherfucker? (singing in Russian) - That guy there, Lewis, he speaks Russian! Okay, I'm gonna go talk to him. - Uh, I think you misunderstood what the fuck I was saying. I was not suggesting you go talk to the crazy motherfucker eating out of the garbage. - Bonjour! (sniffs) - Who you fucking talking to, huh, guy? (suspenseful music) Are you crazy? - That is a very nice knife. - Fuck you. - He's gonna fucking kill him. - I'm Tulio. I'm kind of the cholos. I'm trained in seven forms of martial arts. (speaking French) Give me your money. Give me that fucking ugly suitcase, too. - I don't have any money, and you do not want the suitcase. - These are not the drones you are looking for. - Exactement. - Best ever movie. (laughs) - You want to play in my movie? It'd be better than mugging me. - I used to be in movies. - I knew it, I knew it. - Watch, watch. (pants) Ah! (thuds) Fuck. - You've gotta be fucking kidding me. - Are you alright? - [Lewis] What is this? Bums on ice? - My lumpy. - There you go. - Alright, thank you. - Don't mention it. So, what do you do? - At one time, I was said to be the biggest stuntman Hollywood has ever seen, - No. - but I timed a jump wrong and snapped and no more stunts for me. I bring bad luck and nobody hires bad luck. - You could do the stunt in my movie. I need your help first. - What is it about? - I don't know yet, but it's gonna be great. I have an amazing writer, Oscar-nominated. - Are you shitting on me? - No. - I don't believe you. - Thomas Speare. (laughs) - The guy who fucked over Ivan the known Mexican-Russian guy? He'll never write again if he wants to keep his fingers or his bolitas. - Man, everybody but me knows this story. Do you know Ivan? - Everybody knows Ivan. The fuck are we here for? - Milt has helped me many times before. We have a very important meeting, and you need a costume change. - Oh, I love the pink, I love the red, I love the tight pants and the balls that remind me when I was a bullfighter in Guadalajara. - It is definitely you. - I love this thing. - Magnifique. Also, do you know where I can find a payphone in this city (speaking French). I don't find any anywhere. - You need phone? - Yes! - I have phone. - There? - Oh, here. Very safe place. Nobody touches Tulio here. - Oh, I'm sure. (spits) That's much better. Does your phone work? - Yeah. - I need an address for a phone. But I thought you said your phone worked. - That's not my phone. Ah, I'm fucking you. You have to push zero. - Oh, okay. - Para español, oprima dos. (bullet clanks) - Fuck. (head thuds) Oh, fuck. (gun clicks) (gun cocks) (door knocks) Who is it? - Thomas! It's Jacques Jeunet! Open! - Fucking figures. Go away. - What? - Go away! (door slams) - No, no, Thomas, Thomas. - Is there a seven-foot tall Mexican wrestler in a pink mariachi outfit in my living room? Why is this jerk in my house? - Hey, if you want to kill yourself, that's prop gun. Won't fire, but if you want, I can cut your head off - No, no, no, no. - for free. - God damn it, fucking figures. I paid good money for that shit. What do you want? Why can' you just let me die, huh? And who the fuck is this? - This is Tulio. - King of the cholos! - King of the cholos. Thomas, you cannot kill yourself yet. I need you to write me a script. I got actors, a director. I just need a script. - You just don't give up, do you? - Never. - But, I don't write anymore. - You are just scared. - I'm sorry, I'm not scared of anything. (sniffs) - I smell fear on his balls from here. - Hey, gay mariachi, nobody fucking asked you. (Tulio caws) Like I said, I ain't afraid of nothing. Ah. (thuds) Anyway, Tulio, I'm gonna need him sober for the next part. (speaking Spanish) (speaking French) - I know, but, you know, everyone's always me, "You can't do this, you can't do that," and to finally meet someone who really believes in you. You know, and not superficially because they wanna sleep with you but who actually believes in you. It makes me feel, I don't know, strong. - Wow, but he still wants to sleep with you, I guarantee it. - You don't know him. - Is he a man? - Of course. - So he's got a dick, right? - Hopefully. - So this is a platonic thing? Wow, that's kinda hot. Are there any, like, feathers involved? (laughs) Okay, let's get in character, so play cool, don't say anything until we walk outside past the thing, okay? - Okay, cool. - Cool. - So a blonde and a brunette are waiting in line for an audition. Brunette turns to the blonde and she says, "I'm gonna fuck the producer for this job, "and maybe even the director. "Who you gonna fuck?" Blonde goes to the brunette, "I'm gonna fuck the sound guy." Brunette, "Why you gonna fuck the sound guy? "He doesn't even choose who gets what part or whatever." Blonde, "Well, anytime I'm on set, "all I ever hear is, fuck the sound guy!" (laughs) No disrespect. - None taken. - How may I help you, my lovelies? - I need two packs of Camel Blues. - Your eyes are the most beautiful shade of wonderful I have ever seen. May I kiss you? (laughs) - I'm off duty. - I'm wounded. First pack is five dollars. Second pack is free in exchange for your number. - That'll cost you a whole lot more than a pack of smokes. (sighs) - You frown with your words, but the smile of your eyes inspires my soul. - No, you are not gonna start singing. - You've got the touch! (strums guitar) - [Both] You've got the power! (lively guitar music) The rules you break - Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop stop. - I will not stop until you write your number down. ♪ You break the rules ♪ You break the rules ♪ You take the heat - Fine, fine, fine, I'll write the number, I'll write the number. - Proof it. (hums) (phone rings) I will never wash this hand again. Expect my call. - See ya. (laughs) (footsteps) Hey, do you guys know a good sound recordist for an indie film? - Uh, sunshine, do you know who you're talking to? - Yeah, do you know? - I guess not. - This is Jimmy the Jamma, famed sound engineer, brilliant re-recording artist, and all-around talented motherfucker. - And this here fool, that's Boomie DePaul, that's my boom man. Got an arm that can jerk the chain wax of a, never mind. Point being, so we're the top of the top of the indie sound recording scene, my glorious morning elegance. - Great, would you guys wanna do the sound for a movie I'm working on. I can put you in touch with the producer. - I could. - He could, he could. - But will I is the question in question. That type of commitment comes with a price. - And you gotta pay for the commitmentizing, that's just the way it is. - That's just the way it is. - Oh, we don't have much money, though. It's just a low-budget indie. - Money. I have no use for material things aside from my 24-track test camera cards, assign card, boom mics, extending wireless kit. However, a new form of inspiration has lit upon the windows of my soul. - I'm not for sale. - And I would never be so crass, my maiden fair. Just give me a date, and all will be square. - Do you really believe he can make some music? - Look, it's either make this movie or give up and go home. - Okay, eight dates. Un-fucking-believable, it's like fucking high school. - Ladies. - What a gentleman. - Maiden fair. I bid thee good afternoon. (lips smack) I shall await your call. - Fuck off. - That's the best shit (screams) that ever happened. I'm motherfucking on fire! - I approve. - Tulio, is this the place? - Yeah, this is. - This is a terrible fucking idea. - Thomas, it is the best idea I've had in years, come on. - I told you he was chicken shit. - Hey, gay mariachi, nobody asked for your opinion. (Tulio caws) (Tulio caws) - Thomas, today, we have lunch in hell, come on. - Oh, that's very comforting. Thank you, Jacques. Look, I've got some video tapes to return. - Let's go, you've gotta face your fears, Thomas, come on. - Hey, Olaf, where's Ivan? - You've got some balls bringing that shit in here. - Hey, fuck you! - Say one more word, little man, and I cut off your balls. - I need to see Ivan. I have a proposition to make. - Yeah, but you don't have an appointment, huh? - I will wait until there's nobody on the schedule. The shop is open, no? - Did you see a closed sign on the door? - No. Merci, monsieur. Oh, that is what we need. This is perfect. (whistles) (hums) (whistles) - Hey! Pay first, asshole. - Thomas, pay the man. - Think about your balls before you say one fucking word. - Please pay. - Do you have a plug for this? And can you check if Ivan has a little opening? - I told you, asshole, no openings. Ivan isn't here. Fuck you, Tulio. Go crawl back down your hole. - What is the phone number here? - 1-800-FUCKOFF. - Merci, Tulio! (phone clicks) (phone rings) You should pick up, may be somebody else. - Shit. Boss, hang up. I got this. - [Ivan Voiceover] The fuck you want? - My name is Jacques Jeunet. I need you to produce my movie. (phone clangs) Well, it was worth a try. Tulio, let's go. - Wait, we paid a lot. - Get these fuckers out. - Yeah, let's go. - Yeah. (speaking Russian) - Bonjour, Ivan. - Are you related to the famous Jeunet? - No, just inspired by him. - A shame, hm. You know, when you walked through that door, and I see you're dragging this fucking guy with you, I think you're turning him in for bounty, but then I see my old friend Tulio here dressed like a Mexican whore, and I think to myself, "Who the fuck is this guy?" No offense, Tulio. - I want you to produce my movie. - What's it about? - I don't know, he needs to write it, but I hear there is some bad blood between you two guys. - Yes, I should just kill him and get it over with, but I like watching you suffer. - I have a better idea. Tulio, give me the gun. (guns cock) - That's not a good idea, boss. (speaking Russian) (speaking Russian) Da. (speaking Russian) (screams) - And the debt is now settled between you. (gun clicks) - No! - Now you know I am, as I said, legit. (gun thuds) Now, either you put a gun to your head and pull the trigger, or, you produce my damn movie. - I like this fucking guy. Balls, that's what this world needs more of, huh? Big fucking balls. You know, I loved your movie. I for sure thought you were going to win that Oscar, and then I find out you're not only sleeping with my sister-in-law, you fucked my wife. - Okay, two things. One, I was drunk. Two, they're identical twins, how the fuck was I supposed to know? - Irregardless, the fact that you didn't - Regardless. - What? Excuse me? - Irregardless isn't a word. If you're going to kill me, at least do it with proper grammar! - Irregardless the fact that you didn't know, fuck head, it still fucking hurt. - Well, I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt you. I'm crazy, not stupid. - It's alright, I revenge-fucked your mother anyway, so I'm over it. - What? - Shut the fuck up! - You know, it's the first time in five years you've apologized to me. - [Peach] So, I'll see you back at the apartment later tonight? - Are you sure you don't want me to come in with you? You're not embarrassed because of me, are you? - No, I've just, I've dragged you all over the city today. I feel guilty about it. - Please, it's been amazing fun, and I got a date. (laughs) Look, talent agents are sharks. It's always good to fly with a wing man. - If it really doesn't bother you. - Are you kidding? Whatever magic your friend is using is rubbing off on me, and God knows I love a good rubbing. (laughs) - So God either wants me to put this gun to my head and pull the trigger or produce your movie? - God has nothing to do with it, but your destiny is definitely to produce this movie. - Don't do it, Ivan. (gun fires) - Whoa. - [Jacques] I thought you said it was a fake gun. - I only told you it was fake to pull it out of your mouth. - Well, thanks for letting us in on that detail. - Apparently, I'm destined to produce your movie. (footsteps) - Hi. - Hi! How can I help you? - Hi, I'm here to see Mr. David Douveau. I have an appointment. - Oh, okay, I'll let him know you're here. - [Peach] Thanks. - Oh, you guys have a seat, thanks. (footsteps) - Wow, this place is legit, I'm impressed. - I know, right. Can you imagine what it would do for my career if I got picked up by them? - Yeah. (ominous music) - Are you here for the blonde auditions? - Yeah. - Me too! - Oh, you know, but they know, they - Oh, it's okay, I brought my contacts with me. I can lose the glasses, but thank you. - Sure thing. - The budget is 50,000. - That hardly covers the location. - I own the locations in this town. You'll have your locations. I have cameras, lights, and heck, even fog machines. Budget is still 50K. Okay, we need a script, and fast. Even if I said he could write again without me chopping off his fingers, it's six months before we'll see a script. He's a drunk and out of practice. - Hey, screw you. I'm a writer. I'm always inebriated. I could write a script with my eyes closed in four days if I wanted to. - Okay, today is Tuesday. I'll come over to that shitty little house of yours at 4 p.m. on Saturday to read the script. If you don't have the script ready, I cut off balls, and you, you get the main cast and the director in the house to do a table read, huh? - Okay. - With finalized details, and then you go shoot. - It's a deal. We'll be ready. - But there's one problem. - Mhmm. You need a producer. I will only executive produce. I may scare people with my credentials. You know what I mean, yes? - Absolument, I'll find one, no problem. - Oh, I have no doubt. We will make a great movie. - Thank you. - Good luck. Tulio, keep me updated. - So that's it? We just walk out of here with 50K to make a movie? - I spent more than that for lunch in your city last week, but this isn't about the money, or maybe you've forgotten that. - We will make the movie. - Oh, I know. I know. Balls. Saturday. - So somebody's got some writing to do. - Shut the fuck up. Writing's easy once you got a goddamn story. So, what's our story? - Oh, how about lesbian vampires, meat-eating zombies, and a mighty cock ring to rule them all? - We'll do this for the sequel, maybe. - Never say that to me again. - Thomas, I have an idea. Let's talk, come on. - Hey, friend, anybody has lubricant? (ominous music) - Oh, my God, it's him. (footsteps) - What is she doing here? - Oh, she said she had a callback. - What? No, she hasn't. - Hey, am I glad to see you. - Call security. - I'm sorry but I had my hacker friend get me your number and address because I never heard back on that self-tape, but it's okay because I know you're really busy, so I saved you the time of having to find me, and I'm here now, so we can talk about that part. I love you, by the way. You're so gorgeous. - Wait, you're here for the part of the blonde girl. - It's okay. I have contacts with me. I can take these off. - Excuse me, Miss, could you please come with me? - Yeah, but yeah, it's okay. Take your time. I'll send you another tape. It's not a big deal, really. I'll just go quietly. (footsteps) - Go! - Oh, shit. - Hey, Peach. - Hi. - Ah, you look great. - Thanks. - And hello. - Oh, this is my friend, Katya. - Hi. - Oh, are you here to audition as well? - Not in a million. - Shame, you got the assets. Let me know if you change your mind, yeah? Let's go, Peach. - Okay. - And no need for you to hang around, Katya. It's probably gonna take a while. - [Peach] Well, I'll see you at the apartment later. - Yeah, okay. - Okay. - Bye. - Thanks, bye. - So, you nervous? - A little. - Oh, I'll call you. (blinds ruffle) (ominous music) - Sorry about that. These wannabe actors, you know, they literally will do anything to be right there where you are now. It's a big agency, a lot of stars. - It's a little intimidating. - Yeah, so tell me, what are your career plans? - I just wanna act. - Yeah, I get that, but I mean, are we talking episodic work in TV, features? Obviously, the money is in TV, but features are where you get the acclaim, you know? - I guess both. I've just always loved acting. - [David] Cool. - It's in my blood. - Okay, I need cork board, index cards, and a lot of alcohol. - No, no, my friend, no alcohol until the script is done. - What? How do expect me to write without alcohol? - With you hands. - You don't write with you hands, you write with your imagination. - You said all you needed was one good story. - And a fuck-ton of alcohol! - I'm sorry, my friend, but at least you got a story. Tulio. - Got it, boss. - That's just great. What do you think you're doing? You can't just trap me in here. - Hey, you should be more appreciative. - All we are trying to do is to save your balls. - I, on the other hand, wouldn't mind seeing him lose his balls. Haven't seen that since our trip to the petting zoo. Those fucking ducks are vicious. - Fuck! (head bangs) Fine, Sharpie, pens, butcher paper, index cards, cork board, stat. You, mariachi boy, help me set up this table. - Super, Thomas. I'll see you later. - Alright. - You know, Peach, this is a rough town to get a start in. I mean, let's face it, you're not exactly a teenager anymore, but the good news for you is that we represent and package a lot of product here, so, if we decide to rep you, we can start putting you in on smaller parts, and if you're good, then I can start pushing bigger things your way. - That would be incredible. - I just need to know one thing. How committed are you? - I'm ready to work my guts out. I'll give it my all, just everything. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So, I'm ready for any part. - Yeah, I mean, I get all that. See, what I wanna know is, are you gonna do whatever it takes to get your career rolling? I mean, really rolling (ominous music) (finger tapping) - Hey, Peach! I warned you. You think I came to this town looking for what I do? It's a hard town, honey. A sugar-coated cactus, a shit donut. - Let's go home. - Get out of here, right? I think forgot something upstairs. I'll be right back, okay? (sniffs) - Hi, can I help you? - I'm here to see asshole. - Oh, that could be a lot of people here. (laughs) Do you have a name? - What's the over? - Things seem to be selling. - Okay, how about the under? - 13 change. - Back in participation? - Asshole? Tall, brown, green eyes? There he is. - Oh well, miss, - Box is a highly - you can't go back there - Watch me. - Okay, great work. - Hey, you. Fuck nuts. - I'm sorry, can I help you? (thud) Oh! (groans) - You tell the owner that I'm pressing charges against this rapist. - I didn't touch her. - You would have. Sorry, not for you. - Can somebody tell me what the fuck is going on here? - Oh, I don't know. I've wanted to do that for months. (laughs) - What's up, my man? Living the dream, I see. - Living the dream. I brought Thomas some supply. - I wouldn't get too comfortable with it if I were you. Just when everything seems like it's at its best is right before it all goes to shit. - It's not that kind of story. - Says you, motherfucker. I tried to tell you about those third acts. You talked to your star lately? - No, why? (phone clicks) Oui? Hello, Peach? Who is this? Katya? What? - Anyways, like I was saying over the phone, she took it pretty hard. - Oh. - But not hard that way, you know? In an emotional way. - I think I understand what you mean. Can I see her? Where is she? Wow, you look beautiful even when you cry. - I don't feel beautiful right now. - You obviously have not looked in a mirror. In fact, I could call Vogue right now, they would rush over, and capture this new look of mademoiselle in distress chic. (laughs) - I'll be over here. - When it pours, it rains, no? There are many things that could cause a beautiful woman to weep, but non-class, abusive, (speaking French) should not be one of them. - But he said he would make sure I never worked in this town again. What am I gonna do? - Only the truly talented and hard-working people own this town. Leeches like that can be burned off. - But who's gonna hire me? - Could we go for a little walk so you can clear up your head? - I don't wanna do anything right now. - Which is precisely why you must. - I hate to say it, but he's right, hun. You should definitely get some air and plot your revenge. - If we hurry up, we can make it. It starts in 15 minutes. - It's Suitcase Full of Miracles? - [Jacques] Yes. - It's my favorite. - I know. (gasps) 14 minutes and counting. - Okay. - Who the hell are you? What are you doing knocking on my door? - I've waited my whole life for this moment. Don't you recognize me? - I've never seen you before in my life. - Well maybe if you look hard enough, you'll recognize a little bit of the face you see in the mirror every day, standing right here before you. How could you be? - I deserve to die by your hands, but you have to forgive me. (melancholy music) - Hey, I found a DP and a sound guy. - That's amazing! We're almost there. - But who knows how long it's gonna take to get everything together? It could be a year. - I have to talk to you about that, but the good news is that I have some financing. - Financing? - Yes, financing. - Wait, what do you mean? - Well, we have $50,000 to make the movie, plus we have all the equipment, all the gear, all the locations. The final thing we want to see is the cast, crew, and script by Saturday morning latest, so we have to focus on the movie. This is gonna be a break-out role for you. You should be happy. You're gonna be a star. - When I'm done being shocked, I'll be happy. How did you do this? You're not from this world, are you? - No, madame, I am from Paris. You don't happen to know a producer by any chance? - I do know one. - Amazing, who is it? - I don't actually know him. You know Martin Heran? - The actor from the movie we just saw? - Yeah, well he doesn't really do a lot of acting anymore, but he produces the occasional movie. - How do you know him? - I've never actually met him. - Hm, friend of a friend? - Kind of. Yeah, a friend of mine. - Mhmm. - I met him 30 years ago, and hasn't heard from him since. I mean, she tried, but he never returned her calls or her letters or anything, so, I don't know, it's probably stupid. - Who is this friend? - My mom. - Hm. I think you should go talk to him. - Knock on his door and say, "Hey, wanna produce my movie?" - No, more like knock on his door and say, "Hey, there, I'm your daughter, I would like to know you." - Well, he obviously doesn't want to have anything to do with me. - What is the worst thing that could happen? To my eyes, it already has happened, and you survived. You are beautiful, talented, and here. - I'll think about it. - You want to talk to the crew? - When? - Hello, everyone, this is Peach, our star. (cheers and applauds) - Yay, wow, everybody happy? We're making a movie. Now get the fuck out so I can write. - Hi! I got the text, but hey, I can wait out here if you want. - [Jacques] No, no, come in. We want you in our movie. - Fucking terrific. - Oh, I'm so excited, I almost peed my pants. Oh, I can help with costumes. - Script sup. - Okay, listen up, everyone. Thomas gave you a basic overview of the story, right? - [All] Yes. - Okay. We have until Saturday to bring it all together. - What? Saturday? (everybody mutters) - [Jacques] Yes, Saturday. - I think what everyone's saying here is that's impossible. - Of course it's impossible for everyone, but this team is home. We are the Hollywouldn'ts. Look, I will be frank, my life and Thomas's balls are on the line here. - Thanks, dick. - But more importantly, look at what happened. Fate, destiny, good fortunes conspire to give us a chance. Me and Thomas, we do not have a choice, and I will not make the choice for you, but I will ask you this, take this moment, seize this opportunity, take back your dreams and live them. The movie may be great, or it may be a disaster, but you know what? It will be our disaster, and we will be respected for having the balls to finish it. So, my question is, who is with me? - Yeah! (cheers and applauds) - Perfect. - Perfectesticular! - What? - Roughly translated, grab life by the balls. - Okay, can we please stop talking about balls. - I wanna talk about balls. Boop, boop. - Yes? - I think you know this is a crazy risk, right? - No, this is madness. - No, no, Thomas. Madness would be doing anything else. We're trying to convince ourself that, with no risk, we can achieve our dreams. This is how it's gonna go. We have until Saturday. We have to get the locations, we have to get all the permits.

What's that? - Jus d'orange. (groans) - You could've at least had the decency to add some vodka to it. - So? - No, not yet. - We need it. - Duh, every story needs an ending. - A happy one. - An honest one. - A happy, honest one! (door clicks) - Hi, good morning. - Look, I didn't call anybody from the agency. - What? - Sorry, do I know you? (dramatic music) - I don't know how to say this. - Look, go away. I don't - Wait, please. - You've got 15 seconds before this door shuts on your cute little ass to say whatever it is you have to say, Miss? - Allure. My name's Peach Allure. - That's a great fucking name. (laughs) - Thanks. I've waited my whole life for this moment. Don't you recognize me? - I've never seen you before in my life. - Well, maybe if you look hard enough, you'll recognize a little bit of the face you see in the mirror every day, standing right here before you. You knew my mother, Holly. I know she wrote to you. - Oh, for the love of God, please don't tell me you're gonna stand there and tell me you're my daughter, bombing that ridiculous bullshit from that woman. I don't even know her. We fucked a couple times in a cheap hotel when I was doing a press tour. What a whack job, she was. I'd burn those goddamn letters. Get the fuck outta here, or come in here and fuck me, and we'll develop a real father-daughter relationship. Either way, stop wasting my time with your fairytale bullshit. Get out of here. Go home to your whore mother. (crying) - It's not gonna work. - It's beautiful. - It's deus ex machina. - What? - It doesn't matter. I'm telling you, though, that this ending's going to get panned. Everyone's gonna hate it. - Can I remind you that we only have a few hours before Ivan comes to visit us? - Well, I'd rather lose my balls than write a shitty ending. - But it's not, people want to have a happy ending. People deserve to have a happy ending. - Jacques, I like you, I really do, but I don't know what universe you live in. Look around, look at life, reality? How many happy endings do you see out there? - Look, I grew up eating out of the garbage can, and I can tell you, people don't go to the movies to see what life is. People go to the movies to see what life can be, inspire them, give them hope. Everybody deserves a happy ending. - And that's why there are more massage parlors than good movies. (door thuds) - Guys, we got a big problem. She won't listen to me. - Who won't listen to you? - Reality? - Shh. - It's Peach, she's going to the airport. - What? - She's leaving. - Told you. - Shut up. - Shut up. Tell me exactly what happened. - She went to see Martin Huran. - The producer? - Her father. - Well, that's a twist. (gasps) - Anyway, she told me to give you this suitcase with wheels. She said you would understand. And this letter. - Hm, let me see it. (phone rings) - Stella here. - Stella. - Hey, Jacques not-related-to-the-famous-one Jeunet, what's up? - I need a favor. It's about Peach. - What? (trunk thuds) (doorbell rings) (door knocking) - Ah, fuck, who the hell are you? You picked the wrong guy to fuck with. I'm gonna call the police. - Shut up. I normally don't waste my breath with a piece of garbage guy like you, - Tell that motherfucker. - but here's the deal, in exactly one hour, the editor-in-chief of the largest Hollywood gossip website is gonna be here with 20 reporters and 12 cameras. - You can't - Shut up, again, and they will do something like a stream - Exactly, we're gonna put your shit online, motherfucker. where you're gonna tell the story how, after 30 years, you got reunited with your daughter that you never knew you had, who's going to do her first role in Hollywood, and you're gonna beg her for forgiveness for missing out the last 30 years. - That's right, - [Martin] What the hell? - fuck him up. - And if you don't make this statement, and if you don't make this statement, I will ruin you, I will destroy your reptutation, which is something you totally deserve. I'm giving you this one chance, so you better figure out really quick. You've got 59 minutes and counting. - That's my guy. Now walk out like a boss. Fuck, yes. - Fucking beautiful. - Okay. (door thuds) We need to go to the airport. - Oh, Jacques, I'm not trying to be negative here, but if you're gonna try and run to go to the airport before she gets into a plane, we don't have a budget for that. - And it's such a cliche, hello? - It's Van Nuys, not LAX, hello? - We have a budget for Van Nuys? - But we don't have time. Her plane takes off in 10 minutes. - Call her. - I'm trying, she's not answering. - To the airport! (engines revs) - [Announcer] 859 first exit. (announcer speaking) - Merci, everyone. - You're too late, Jacques. Her plane is leaving. I told you we should've come here first. - I know, and now I go. - And I'm so angry, I'm not gonna add sexual innuendo to that. - [Tulio] Jacques, other way, other way! (upbeat percussion music) - [Announcer] Flight 608 now arriving in Section 2B. Flight 608 now arriving in Section 2B. - Mm, mm, mm. (sighs) Man, she could be flying anywhere now. You'll probably never see her again. - Thank you for making me feel much better about it. - Yeah. - I will call her when she lands. Let's go. - Thomas is gonna lose his balls. Little Tommy No-Nuts, that's what they'll call him now, and you? They'll probably shoot you in the face. - Thank you for rubbing it in. - Seriously? Come on, man, you know I got your back, bitch. And what did I tell you about third acts? Destiny. Karma. Hollywood. Destiny's calling, motherfucker. Make the call. - She's in the plane. What do you mean, "Make the call, make the call"? She's in the plane. - Just pick up the damn phone. (phone rings) (romantic music) - I'm so sorry I decided to leave. - And I am so glad you decided to stay. Shall we go? May I present you our star? (cheers and applauds) - Peach, you really need to see something. - Let's go. (upbeat percussion music) - [Jacques] Let's go. - So tell me about your first movie experience. - I was in South France with this beautiful, young - Well, if it isn't Cinderella herself. - Oh, my darling. (hand smacks) - That's for abandoning me as a child. (hand smacks) That's for calling my mother a whore. You see that girl over there? She's an escort and a porn star, and she has more integrity than you'll ever have. You're the only whore I know. (thuds) That's for 30 years of pain. I wish I'd known that you were never worth it. - Woo! - Hey! - Awesome! - Well, I think that about sums it up. - Damn, I know that hurt, especially with balls that old. Bet it's like smashing dinosaur eggs, small, fragile ones, though. Hm. - So, here I am now a lifetime of fear, ready to succeed in Hollywood. - That's an amazing dream. - Dreams are sometimes the only thing you have left. - Okay, that's great, guys. Now, let's shoot it. - Last looks, everybody. 30 seconds, let's go. (clapping) - So sexy. I mean the light. - This is so fun, isn't it? (soothing piano music) - [Cameraman] And, action. - My boy's come a long way, hasn't he? - Yeah, we did good, huh? Huh? Alright, open the Bombay doors, baby. - Aye, aye, Captain. (inspirational music) - So, that's how it would've been, huh? - Yeah, wonderful, no? - Could've been a beautiful life, my friend. - Yeah, it could've been. - Well, kid, take better care of yourself next time. - That is a terrible ending. - [Thomas] The critics are gonna love it. - He's right, Jacques. Having a depressing ending is the vogue thing right now. - But did you all see me, though? I mean, I look great. I would fuck myself. - Can't we do screening or something? - Too expensive, we don't have budget. - Can we ask these people? - Which people? - These people. So, what did you think of the ending? - [Man] That ending sucked. - Hey, fuck you. What do you know? - [Man] Told you. - You and me outside, now. Tulio, let's go. - Huh, huh, huh. - Go, bring your knife. - What other endings did we shoot? - We have a whole bunch of alternate ones. - Which ending's your favorite? - The one where they live ever happily after. - Oh. (chuckles) ("Dreams Come True" by Rebecca Holden) The make-up looks great. - I love your boobs. - They do look bigger on camera. - Mhmm. - What about me? Underappreciated. - We couldn't have done it without you. - That's right, I run a tight ship. - Very tight. - Did you see the rack focus on that? The depth was like visually stunning. - Turning that shit and spinning that shit was off the fucking chain. (coughs and laughs) - Continuity was amazing. - [Woman] You did a great job. - Every single scene in order. - It's you! Your name is right there! - They spelled it wrong. - Hey, this movie's gonna win an Oscar for sure. - Or a Razzie. - Hm. - How would you like to be in my next film? I got the perfect role for you. (laughs) (knocking) (laughs) - Alright, again. - [Peach] Oo, Scabby's Cat Food, so delicious! - Killed it in that damn scene with you. You was on some Sixth Sense shit. (laughs) I was waiting for Bruce Willis to pop the fuck out and say, "What's up?" - Boss, turn on the TV. It's that guy we were telling you about. - Who? - The one who got hit by the writer, drugged, kidnapped in the hospital, and then still made it to the audition. - It's crazy. - We need to hire that guy. (remote thuds) Oh, look. It's Martin. He really is such an asshole. - You're the only whore I know. (thuds) That's for 30 years of pain. - Oh, people in this town - [Peach] I wish I'd known - have been wanting - [Peach] that you were never - to do that to him for years. Get her on the phone for me now, please. - Ow, well I think that about sums it up. ♪ Look at you and me ♪ Heaven helped us to (ominous music) ♪ Believe that dreams come true ♪ ♪ In ♪ This ♪ Moment ♪ Filled ♪ With ♪ Deep emotion ♪ A love I never knew ♪ Never, never knew ♪ Until I found you ♪ I promise that I do ♪ Believe that dreams come true ♪ ♪ Believe that dreams come true ♪ - Are you still here? Seriously? What the fuck? Look, don't you know this movie's too goddamn long already? Whoever's editing this shit is fucking up. Well, except with my stuff. Actually, I've been rather amazing, I think you would agree. Matter of fact, the Academy, remember a brother when you handing out envelopes, I'm just saying, putting it out there. Look, just go do something useful, alright? Buy me some fucking sushi. Better yet, buy this movie. I'ma be outside bootlegging this motherfucker, so, get a couple copies, one for you and your auntie. I actually usually buy some sushi. That's what we'll do. Shit. Well, I'm going to sleep. Fuck y'all. (sighs) Yeah.
