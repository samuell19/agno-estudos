Take off your shoes and hop in The final kneading cannot be done with a shovel You gotta do it with your feet What happened to your face?

You've got legs like chopsticks - What? - Keep treading Did you wash your feet? Come on, do it properly. You'll fall like that You're making a mess Mr. Kim...Can I ask you a question? What is it? Why do I have to take the clothes off? Why does it have to be nude? What should you be wearing then? Pardon? I am searching for a certain value through the human body If not the essence of beauty, it could just be beauty Clothes are nothing but a shell I need to find a pose for a body piece, but it's not easy Wait Lean forward That's it Turn your head More. There Can you remember this pose? I feel good Fucking great Why are you so late? I've been waiting so long What brings you here?

Thank you Aren't you pushing yourself too hard these days? I'm not I won't be a nagging old man Don't make the condition worse You've been a great artist and you still are Can't you take it easy and enjoy it as a hobby now? Doctor... I'll give you a vitamin shot while I'm here Like you said he gained a lot of energy Mostly because he started working again But I didn't tell Jun-gu that I'm worried he'll push himself too hard You did the right thing You have to be careful It's not about art you need to take care You know that Still, he's never been so well ever since we moved out here So, I thought... Well, I took a blood sample today We'll know better when we get the results back All good now I'll be going then How is it working for you?

Well, I...missed the last train Oh? No rooms at the motel in downtown Oh dear I'm sorry but there is only one room in this house I'll stay in the kitchen, and wait for the first train He asked me to look after you Don't shout! We ended up living together Come and sit here Can you borrow some money? What? I hear there's a decent general store out on sale for 30,000 If we put down 10,000 as down payment, we can pay the rest in installment No I got all the advances that I can get What did you say? Did you just say 'no' to me? What I meant was... What is it that you do at this professor's house? What are you insinuating? I do cleaning and laundry And yet, they pay you so generously There's a lot of work Do you want me to ask them myself? No...I'll ask That's not right Do you need a break?

Most of the time, yes Doesn't look like me It doesn't have to be anyone specific Oh it's okay. Thank you. Her eyes are closed Is she sleeping? Imagine that her eyes are open and wearing an expression Who would look at the body? They'll just look at the face The face... Mr. Kim The car in the backyard... is that really working? I have to look at the person's face to know whether he is angry or sad or happy So, you can express all that emotion just through the body? That's incredible Man, you chickened out? You're the best Why don't you just fold? Wait Jeez! You scared me Think it over, man You won some today. Let this one go He looks like a bluff Show him what you've got But, man... What the heck? Life is just a big gamble Flip them You should've been more careful He had 'professional‚Äô written all over But you told me to do it Bastard! Where's the oil mill moved to? Across the bridge Thank you That stupid girl asks the same thing every time Who is she? Look at her swaying ass Isn't she the youngest of the mill owner who moved to Seoul? She was taken in by that professor as a surrogate wife A surrogate wife? They have no kids? No She just looks like a servant girl But they already have a housemaid Why would they need another one? - Mom - Yes, dear I like that he's not around I wish he never comes back You shouldn't wish for something like that Alright? Okay Don't even think that Go in, watch your brother carefully Wait. Put your clothes back on Sit on the chair I'm thinking maybe I'll do a bust Really? But I need to see the muscle of your neck, can you pull down the shirt a little? What the fuck is this? It's not what you think. I'll explain You filthy whore Stop! Stop! Stop! Get off! No Don't touch him No, not that! No, not that! Kill me if you have to Have you lost your mind? What the fuck... What the fuck is all this? Get up, you shameless whore Mr. Kim is okay. Yes, ma'am... Mrs. Gyeongsan Oh god... Look at you, what a mess! Don't worry about the kids They're sound asleep Bring more water I'm worried about you You're up? I'm sorry I slept in Mr. Kim said to take the day off He did? Mrs. Kim, you're early I know nothing about art and I don't care Fine Just leave her alone until the work is done It'll only be another few days I took care of him I never threaten anyone before, I feel a little awkward Okay well done, thank you. Is the family in Seoul well? Your wife sent me What is art for? Life is short but art is long Hippocrates You know only one thing Giacometti chose a cat's life over art You shouldn't be making a sculpture of a woman Look at what art has done to you Think about your wife Take a seat This'll look good on you Such a fair face...How much it must've hurt We took care of your husband problem You can stay here until the piece is finished Don't cry It's Okay Thank you I have the results from the blood test I'm sorry The improvement he showed, was only temporary By the time the wind gets chilly, he may not be able to move Brace yourself Mr. Kim is late It's okay. He used to stay up all night Things must be going well You forgot to look at the time You're right Why didn't you come to the studio if you were so worried? When did I ever? Is that right? That's true Do you remember? I think it was when we only just got married We didn't have telephone back then so, if you stay up all night working I would come out to the embankment and wait for you from the break of dawn I would think to myself, We're only just married, how can he just think about work all the time? Looking back, those were the happiest days I talked too much today, didn't 1? You look tired. Have a good sleep I owe you and I'm sorry It was a blessing that I met you Darling, I... I'm happier than I can ever ask for And... I love you Mr. Kim asked you to come today? I thought I would stop by anyway Hello? What brings you here? Is Mrs. Min-gyeong Lee here? Where is she? Come on Lift the cover Is this your husband? What happened? At first, we thought he slipped and fell but actually he was shot We'll know better after an autopsy You can go home for now Mr. Kim? All this time, I've been searching for beauty only in the human body But thanks to you, I've come to understand the true beauty How beautiful the trace of life engraved in a person's face is Only now am I able to look back at myself You have taught me the greatest lesson Your husband won't ever come back Unfortunately, it seemed like... the only thing that I could do for you I sincerely hope that you'll find happiness Thank you from the bottom of my heart Come on...We have work to do, Mr. Kim Don't go We've got to let him go I've known that I only had little time left I didn't want my perishing body to be a burden on you Although my body is facing the winter, my art has finally reached spring I decided to call this piece Spring As some sculptor said, life is more precious than art I know that now On this face, my life is engraved and you are reflected in my life I've never been good enough for you So, I only confess now that I've always loved you from the moment I first laid eyes on you
