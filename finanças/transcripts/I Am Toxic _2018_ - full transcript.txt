I AM TOXIC Buenos Aires province, Argentina, 2101 AD Hey! - The Father... The Son... And the Holy Spirit. Amen. - No! No. - Didn't they tell you this is a very dangerous place? Where are you from? - Far away. What's your name? Come with me. You're a lucky guy. I'm almost never around here. I found you by accident. Come on in. Are you staying here? You'll starve to death. Do you remember the very first time we saw these dried ones? Nobody understood anything. The very first time I saw planes throwing dead bodies, I thought to myself, "This is the end." But I didn't think there was going to be so much hunger that people would eat those bodies. Where are those planes coming from? Have you lost your memory? Bacteriological war. Does it ring a bell? Conflict in the Northern Hemisphere. Hunger in the Southern Hemisphere. Infected bodies from the Northern Hemisphere. Dried ones in the Southern Hemisphere. It is what it is, son. I would thank the Lord for erasing my memory. Some things are better forgotten, right? To me, these dried ones are better than we are. The have nothing to worry about, they don't think, they have food everywhere. Welcome, son. You'll be better here. Let me introduce you to my family. You'll like them. Donald? Come here, love. - Are you back so early because you didn't find anything? - I brought visitors. - Oh-ho... Visitors! Welcome! What's your name? - We need to feed him. He's exhausted. - Exhausted. Well, welcome. My pleasure. Your hands are dry. Eh-hee... Easy! I'm not doing anything. We just need to check out who we're hanging out with. - The girl will give you something to eat. Water? - Yes, thank you. - He speaks! I thought he didn't. There you go. Your throat must be dry. Easy, man. There's more. Easy. Just enough. - Listen! If I were you, I'd leave right now. Just leave. Escape! These people are dangerous! Just kidding! It's a joke. Come sit here. I'm kidding! Come over here so you can eat. - Are you being cared for? I don't know what to call you, son. - When I was a child, I had a dog. He was a Dogo. It was a beautiful dog. Skinny, mangy. But he loved to fight. He reminds me of him. He looks strong. - Come on, doggie. Eat! You like it! - Come on! Eat your food! - Check his clothes! He's got to have something! - This will suit me. Wash it. - I'm not one of the dried ones. - But soon you will be. - How far is he? - Quite advanced. He's lost his memory, soon he'll lose his sight. - Leave me alone. Leave me alone. - Please, leave me alone. - What is he saying? - He wants to be left alone. - We can't leave you alone, we're setting up a circus! We have a talking dog! - Come, baby girl. You do it. It looks so good. It looks like a little baby. - Come on! Just do it! Say something! What does it feel like? What does it feel to be a dried one? Don't. - I'll see you later, dog. I'll see you. - Sleep tight, baby. Doggie! Hey, dog. Wake up! It's time to wake up. Come on, doggie. Wake up. Come on, dog! Bark! - Come on! - Bark! Otherwise people get bored at the circus. Again! One more time. - That's it, guys. Let's try something else. - That's a great choice, man. - Yeah! - Can't you do anything on your own? - Stop! - But why? - Leave him, I said! Come on. You go. Let me go. I didn't do anything to you. I don't even know who I am. - Put him away. - Already? - Yes. Already. - We're gonna put you away until you're drier. - Move! - Come on! - Hold on there! Unless there's a full moon and you turn. - I'm going to make rounds. We're out of food. We'll handle this guy when I'm back. Did you feed the pig? - Yes, Father. I was on it. - Okay. Continue. - What about you, doll? You could feed my animal. SETTLEMENT - Wait! Why are you doing this? - What are you doing out here? Hey! Hey! Hey! - Son of a bitch! - Come on, fatty. Get up! - Yeah. Come on. - Let's go get him. Come on! SETTLEMENT - Sit, doggie! Sit! - Hey! Where are you going? Is he here? She says he's inside. - Did you see him? Did she see him? - Hold up, hold up. Come here. You can sit here and wait. The mute doll and myself are gonna fix your mess. Go on. - Do you know why I'm going? Because you're a pussy. - Oh, yeah? Go on. - She's got more balls than you do. Doggie! I don't want the Father to get mad. Fuck. Doggie! Doggie! - Woof! - Let him go! Let him go! - Shoot him! - Let him go, I said! - Shoot him! Shut up! Let him go, doggie! - Just fucking shoot him! You shot me! Get in here! He's getting away! - You're such a moron. Can't you just stay still? Where did he go? - He went that way. To the back. He may be hiding there. Help me. Take it out. Come on, mute doll! Help me! Hey! Help me, you mute! - Why are you doing this? - I'm the one asking questions, dog. Do you think... This little arrow from this far will be able to blow your brains out and let them stick on that wall? Huh? What do you think? Why are you after me? What do you know? - Do you want to know the good or the bad? - What's my name? Who am I? - I'm sorry, ma'am. Okay, doggie. Yeah, keep at it! Go! Come on! I can almost see the light! He's still strong. - Come here! Come! - Let him go! I want to kill him! - No! - I want to kill him. - No, wait! - Why not? - I have a better idea. Let's play Hangman. - Okay. Yeah. - You in? There you go. You start. You go. - Our second contestant... The mute doll. - What was that? - Go check. Go on! - Get out of my way. - We have a guest! - Is this the only one? - Look outside! - There are too many. Let's go, let's go! Let's go! They're going to pay for this. - The Wise Men are here. What did the Wise Men bring? - What is this? Look at that! This is for me! - Don't be an ass. No, no. This is for me. The pig is ready to be slaughtered. And a pig course with this tastes terrific. - There's no more pig. - What do you mean? - Donald is gone. - What happened? - He's gone. What is it? - That's what I want to know. - The dried one you brought escaped and made a mess. - No! - But we got him, and we hanged him. - He couldn't have escaped on his own. You helped him. You opened the cage. I knew I didn't have to bring that guy. What happened here? - Nothing. Why? - What do you mean why? Get dressed and get in here. Son of a bitch. I leave for a day to get all of that, and all you do is screw up. - The Wise Men did good. - Don't worry, Father. We handled it! We got him! I wanted to bring him here but... She had a better idea. - An idea? What did you do with the guy? I told you not to do anything until I got back. - Donald's back? - A dried one? How did he get here? - Let's see what's going on. - You stay here. They opened the gate. The dog's back. With a pack of dogs. - You want some? - Go hide. - Yes, Father. - No, you're staying here. - Okay, Father. - We'll take them one by one. Let's not screw up. There are too many. - Are you sure it's not Donald? - Shh! - Are you okay? Me, too. Come on. Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch, come here. Bring it! Son of a bitch! Come here, take this! I'm fucking you right now. Do you like it when I fuck you with my flabby dick? Can't you wake up, moron? - What the fuck? Who's there? Is it you, dog? Doggie, is it you?! Stop playing with your food, dog! Ah! Go ahead, shoot! How much time do you have left? Fifteen minutes? You dried dog. I bet you can't remember why you're here. Are you going to leave me here to starve to death? Nah. I'd rather die than become a dried one. - Who are you? - She can't answer you. She doesn't have a tongue. She used to talk too much. "My dad" this, "my dad" that. Yada, yada, yada. And the boys got tired. They took out her tongue. But she understood. Because she's very grateful. Isn't that right, Iris? - Iris? Let's go. - We'll find a house. Everything will work out. - I brought you here so she can indulge herself, and release that anger of hers. But I fucked up. I messed her head up. Why? - I'll tell you why. Because they were my family. That's why you'll die here, in this pigpen. Because you're an animal. I should have killed you the minute I saw you. - You started with me. - No, we didn't. We only kill dried ones. Like you. - Iris! Iris! No! Iris! Eat! - Do you think we're even now? I don't. Let's have her handle it. Go! You're a guy with very bad luck. If I hadn't found you, you'd be a happy dried one out there eating bodies. You didn't inherit his bad luck. You found us. We gave you a place to live. We protected you. Isn't that right, Iris? Kill him! You hate him! - I don't care what you do. I want to know what I did. - Oh, you want to know what you did? That's what you want to know? Go ahead and tell him, doll. If you can. No. Why? - Come on, Iris. This is your opportunity, baby. Come on, do it. Go on! - You can't leave me here. I will starve to death. I AM TOXIC
