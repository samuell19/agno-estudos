MATILDA AND HER SPARE HEAD A head. It's a sort of box full of shelves. And if we're told "a dog has 4 legs", it jumps inside via our ears and is stored there. Of course, we've to keep it tidy. Otherwise, we could hardly find anything. On inquiry about the number of dog's legs, we'd just stand and stare, without having a clue if it was 2, or 9. Thus it's crucial to store in our head only the most important things. Otherwise, all the space would fill up with crap. But there was a girl called Matilda whose head resembled a department store filled with mixed goods. Her head had a green hue because Matilda spent all her time indoors. But her mom didn't mind. She was proud of her encyclopedic knowledge. She envisioned her daughter would become a teacher not a housewife bound to a stove. Whereas other children tried to learn only the basics, Matilda strove to grasp everything. Thus her head was full of "inasmuch", "because", "however". And also "Calcutta", "calculation", "calorie", "close-fitting", "camouflage." She tried to memorize weather forecasts. Once, to avoid boredom, she committed to memory all the traffic timetables. And mom said, "Matilda, you're such a bright girl!" "Traffic timetables are usually so complicated. Now, I can just ask you!" Then she rewarded Matilda with sweet candy and asked her to memorize the best wishes to aunt Bertha. Because tomorrow is auntie's name's day. The next day, Matilda had a slight headache. You know, traffic timetables are complicated. There are too many arrivals and departures. Fortunately, the homework was easy today. Just reading an article about polar bears. Thus Matilda started to learn for school. But soon she burst into tears, "Holy moly, my dear mom!" "What's wrong with me? I can't recall anything I learn." Mom took it lightly. "C'mon, Matilda, you've such a bright brain! It's impossible." "Stand upright as in school and chant from memory." "I'm sure it'll be fine." - So, Matilda said, "In the vast northern plains, hardly ever touched by human feet, surrounded by never melting ice and snow, live polar bears who are entire..." Ehm... the end! Mom said, "What's next, Matilda? Continue!" "Of course, entire polar bears live there and not only their halves." But Matilda was not able to elaborate. Now, mom finally got scared, "Holy moly!" "Her head is full of express trains and there is no more space left." "What now?" "The best solution would be an empty spare head." So, mom ran to the store and thought for herself, "We're supposed to go to aunt Bertha and instead I've to shop for a spare head." "Besides, spare heads might be sold out?!" Fortunately, these were redundant worries. If the market can offer spare buttons for coats, or spare tires for cars, why shouldn't spare heads be available too? A perfectly fitting model was available! Matilda was so glad. She learned all about the polar bears. And then, being so joyful about the solution, she memorized the whole phone book. And mom said, "You see, Matilda, you're a bright girl again!" "Phone books are so complicated to search. Now, I can just ask you!" Then she gave Matilda white stockings, adorned her head with a red ribbon, and said, "Let's go to catch the train!" "When does it depart?" However, Matilda was clueless. Timetables were stored in the old head. Mom had to replace the heads. Once it was done, Matilda said, "Our train is leaving in 5 minutes." And mom exclaimed, "Holy moly!" "We must take taxi to the train station." "What's the taxi's phone number? C'mon, Matilda!" However, Matilda was clueless. The phone book was stored in the new head. Poor mom cried out, "Holy moly, we'll miss the train!" "What's the number? Matilda, hurry up!" Matilda responded, "The number is 824 225." The taxi came to doorstep in no time and they hurried to the train station. But mom exclaimed, "Stop! Back!" "Best wishes are stored in the old head!" But before they were able to exchange the heads and reach the train station the train was, of course, gone. "Holy moly!" said mom while going back home by tram. All the rush made them tired, so they took seats. However, a lady with a cabbage in a net bag stepped in and wanted to sit down. An older man said, "Hey girl, help this lady carry the bag, when you sit." And mom marveled, "What a splendid cabbage!" "Where could you afford it?" "I had a call from my friend that there's a new shipment in green-grocery." So, they had a little chat. But at home mom lamented, "Matilda, you scatter-brain, why don't you pay more attention?" "You swapped bags! Now, we've got a cabbage instead of your spare head." "In your spare head is stored all about polar bears which you need for school." Matilda responded, "We don't know the lady's name, but we know she has a phone." "Actually, it's true! If someone gets a call, she must have a phone." said mom and ordered Matilda to identify all the likely phone numbers. However, Matilda was clueless. the phone book was stored in the lost head and thus mom had to go to a call-box. She called all the likely numbers the whole evening and night. The whole morning too, but it wasn't right. Because a call from the call-box shouldn't exceed 5 min! But ultimately she found the lady who soon rang the doorbell and apologized for mistaking a spare head for cabbage and cooking it for two hours. But mom responded, "Nevermind! The main point is the head is back." She attached it to Matilda, so she wouldn't be late for school. At school, teacher asked, "What do you know about the polar bears, Matilda?" "Your skin has a healthy hue. How come?" Matilda responded, "We did some running with mom lately." Then she stood upright and said, "In the white plains of the far north, hardly ever touched by human feet, surrounded by never melting ice and snow, live polar bears who are entire... cooked." Then the children started to laugh and the teacher was completely perplexed, "What do you mean by cooked? They are entirely white." But what else could poor Matilda say? Everything within her head was cooked. As such, all she could do was permanently think about cooking. Her mom was desperate, "Oh, Matilda! This way you won't become a teacher. You'll be bound to the stove." "Holy moly!" But then she thought it could be still reverted. She ran to the store again and upon returning said, "Take it, Matilda! But this head is the last one!" "No traffic timetables!" "No phone books!" "Remember!" Matilda remembered these words and stored within her head only the truly important items. THE END
