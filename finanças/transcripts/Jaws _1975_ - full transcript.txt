Doctor says he's okay. Mild shock. He can go home in the morning. - How's my big kid? - I'm all right. You gonna miss me tonight? You can watch television. - Want anything from home? - My cars. - What about ice cream? - Coffee. Want to take him home? Like to New York? No. Home, here. I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry. You got a pen, Larry? Yeah, pen, you know. 'Cause you're gonna do what you do best. You're gonna sign this voucher so I can hire a contractor. - I don't know if I can do that without- - I'm gonna hire Quint to kill the shark. - August? - What? What are you talkin' about? Summer's over. You're the Mayor of Shark City. These people think you want the beaches open. I was acting in the town's best interest. You were acting in the town's best interest. That's why you're gonna do the right thing. That's why you're gonna sign this, and we're gonna pay that guy what he wants. My kids were on that beach, too. Sign it, Larry. $10,000. - $200 a day, whether I catch him or not. - You've got it. Get the Mayor off my back so I don't have more zoning crap. You've got that. One case of apricot brandy, and you buy the lunch. Two cases. And you get dinner when you get back. Champagne, pâté de foie gras, Iranian caviar... ...and don't forget the color TV. You try this. Made it myself. Pretty good stuff. Thanks. Here's to swimmin' with bow-legged women. Excuse me, Chief. Can't get a good man these days, under 60. All gone at least 35 years. Don't drink that. You'll need an extra hand. - This is Matt Hooper. - I know. - I've crewed three Trans Pacs. - Transplants? - He's from the Oceanographic Institute. - And an America's Cup trial. Mr. Hooper, I'm not talkin' about pleasure boatin' or day sailin'. I'm talkin' about workin' for a living. I'm talkin' about sharkin'. I'm not talkin' about hookin' some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talkin' about finding a great white. Porkers? Talkin' about porkers? Just tie me a sheepshank. I haven't had to pass basic seamanship in a long time. You didn't say how short you wanted it. How's that? Gimme your hands. Dogfish? You got a $5,000 net and you got $2,000 worth of fish in it. Along comes Mr. Whitey, by the time he's finished with that net... ...it looks like a kiddy's scissors class has cut it up for a paper doll. You got city hands, Mr. Hooper. You been countin' money all your life. I don't need this. I don't need this working class hero crap. You're not gonna do this aboard the ship are you, Mr. Quint? Maybe I should go alone. It's my party. It's my charter. Yeah, it's your charter, it's your party. It's my vessel. You're on board my vessel... ...I'm mate, master, pilot... ...and I'm captain. I'll take him for ballast, Chief. You got him. Tail rope, eye splice, M-1, pliers, irons... Sample bottles, dye marker, flares, safety float... ...temperature gauge, spear guns, SMG... What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut? Take that stuff down below and you lash it secure. Jesus H. Christ! When I was a boy, every squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a swordfisherman. What have you got here? A portable shower or a monkey cage? - An anti-shark cage. - Anti-shark cage? You go inside the cage? Cage goes in the water? You go in the water? Shark's in the water. Our shark. "Farewell and adieu to you, fair Spanish ladies "Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain "For we've received orders for to sail back to Boston "And so never more shall we see you again" - Did you take your Dramamine? - Yes. I put an extra pair of glasses in your black socks... ...and there's the stuff for your nose, the zinc oxide and Blistex is in the kit. Goddamn women today, they can't handle nothin'. Young girls just ain't quite smart like their grandmothers were. That's got to be Quint. Colorful, isn't he? He scares me. - Don't use the fireplace in the den. - What am I gonna tell the kids? Tell them I'm going fishing. Break it up, will ya, Chief? Daylight's wastin'. Front: bow. Back: stern. Better get it right, squirt... ...or I throw your ass out the little round window on the side. This isn't no Boy Scout picnic. See you got your rubbers. "Here lies the body of Mary Lee, Died at the age of 103 "For 15 years she kept her virginity, Not a bad record for this vicinity" All right, Commissioner, fasten your safety belt. If you see a shark, Hooper, swallow. Up periscope. Rig for depth charge. How's the Missus, Chief? If they don't like you goin' out, they'll love you comin' in. Keep that chum line goin'. We got five good miles on it. - Who's driving this boat? - Nobody. The tide. One time, I caught a 16-footer off Montauk. Had to stick two barrels in him. Two to wear him down and bring him up. Nowadays, these kids, they take out everything. Radar, sonar, electric toothbrushes. Jesus H. Christ. Best drop another chum marker. Damn it, Martin! This is compressed air. - What the hell kind of a knot was that? - You pulled the wrong one. You screw around with these tanks, and they're gonna blow up. Yeah, that's real fine, expensive gear you've brought out here. I don't know what that bastard shark's gonna do with it. Might eat it, I suppose. Seen one eat a rockin' chair one time. Next time, you just ask me which line to pull, right? Little brown eel comes out of the cave... ...swims into the hole... ...comes out of the hole, back into the cave again. It's not too good, is it? Nothin's easy, is it? One more time. I got it. - What? - Get behind me. Hooper, reverse her! Takin' a hell of a lot of line. Get the scoop out of the bucket. Wet the reel. Reverse her! Duck your head down. We're swingin'. Get behind me again. No more water. I don't want you to drown me. Hooper, you idiot, starboard! Ain't you watchin' it! Hooper, neutral. Where'd he go now? He ain't foolin' me. What's he yankin' on now? Go on, try it. I don't know, Chief, if he's very smart or very dumb. Jesus... He's gone under. He's gone under the boat. I think he's gone under the boat. Yeah, it's too easy. He is a smart, big fish. He's gone under the boat. Keep her steady, now. I got somethin' very big. I don't think so. Chief, put your gloves on. You put your gloves on, both of you. Getting ready to run out again. Quint, let it go. You may be big in the lab, but out here you're just cargo. If you don't want to backstroke home, you get down here. You don't want to listen to me, don't listen to me. - It's not a shark. - The wire's showing! Unbuckle me. - Get the other side. - It's a tuna or swordfish. Take this rod. - Give the Chief a hand, will you? - Right! It's a marlin or a stingray... ...but it's definitely a game fish. Gamin' fish? Marlin, stingray bit through this piano wire? Don't you tell me my business again. - You get back on the bridge. - Quint, that doesn't prove a damn thing. It proves one thing. It proves that you wealthy college boys don't have the education enough... ...to admit when you're wrong. What's the point? Hooks and lines? You lose one, you rig one. Twelve minutes, south, southeast, now. Full throttle. Aye, aye, sir. You see, what I do, Chief, is I trick 'em to the surface. And then jab at 'em. I'm not gonna haul 'em up like a lot of catfish. Full throttle. I don't have to take this abuse much longer. Your head's bleeding. First aid there. Start that chum line again, will ya? Let Hooper take a turn. Hooper drives the boat. Stop playin' with yourself, Hooper. Slow ahead, if you please. You heard him. Slow ahead. Slow ahead. I can go slow ahead. Come on down and chum some of this shit. You're gonna need a bigger boat. Shut off that engine. - That's a 20-footer. - 25. Three tons of him. We're gonna need a bigger boat, right? Gotta get to work. How do we handle this? Come up front, Martin. I need you. He's circling the boat. Amity Point Light Station to Orca. This is Amity Point Light Station to Orca. Come in, Orca. - Orca. Come in. - I have Mrs. Martin Brody here. Put her on. - Come on, Martin! Move! - I'm not goin' out there! Beyond the edge of the barrels. Go to the end of the barrels, further out. - Further out. - Why? - Go further out. - What for? Will you go to the end of the pulpit? - What? - Will you go to the end of the pulpit? I need something in the foreground to give it some scale. Foreground my ass! Your husband's okay. He's fishin'. He just caught some stripers. We'll bring 'em for dinner. We won't be long. We ain't seen anything yet. Over. Out. - I'm not staying here! - I'm begging you! Goddamn it! Come here, come here, darlin'. I want you up on the bridge, just take her forward, steady. - I've never steered a boat in my life. - Just watch my hand, take her steady. Attach the end of this line to the first keg. I've got to get a good shot at that porker's head. Get clear of the bow. - Hurry up, will ya? - Your turn, Quint. Hooper, where are you? Hurry it up now, tie it on. He's comin' straight for us! Don't screw up now. Don't wait for me. Come on, Hooper. Come on. Hurry it up. Tie it on. Now. Now. Kill it! Now! Shoot! Time. What were you doin', anyway? I didn't get a clean shot right in the head. Let's see how long that barrel takes to bring him up. Free another barrel. I'm comin' around again. What do we do now? We're quittin', right? We got one barrel on him. We stay out here until we find him again. We could radio in and get a bigger boat... Don't you worry about it, Chief. It won't be permanent. You want to see something permanent? You want to feel somethin' permanent? Just put your hand underneath my cap. You feel that little lump? Knocko Nolans, St. Paddy's Day, Boston. I got that beat. It's a moray eel. It bit right through my wet suit. I don't know about that, but I entered an arm wrestlin' contest... ...in an Oakie bar in San Francisco. See this? I can't extend that. You know why? 'Cause in the semi-final... ...celebrating my third wife's demise... ...big Chinese fella, he pulled me right over. Look at that. That's a bull shark. He scraped me when I was takin' samples. I got something for you. There's a thresher. You see that? A thresher's tail. - Thresher? - It's a shark. - You want a drink? Drink to your leg? - I'll drink to your leg. So we drink to our legs. I got the crème de la crème. Right here. Hold on. Here, you see that? You're wearin' a sweater. Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit. She broke my heart. What's that one? - What? - That one, there. On your arm. A tattoo. I got that removed. Don't tell me. Don't tell me, "Mother." What is it? That's the U.S.S. Indianapolis. You were on the Indianapolis? What happened? Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into her side, Chief. I was comin' back from the island of Tinian to Leyte... ...just delivered the bomb, the Hiroshima bomb. 1,100 men went into the water. Vessel went down in 12 minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about half an hour. Tiger, 13-footer. Know how you know that when you're in the water? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. Well, we didn't know. Because our bomb mission had been so secret... ...no distress signal had been sent. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, sharks come cruisin'... ...so we formed ourselves into tight groups. Kinda like old squares in a battle like you see on a calendar... ...like the Battle of Waterloo. The idea was, the shark comes to the nearest man... ...and he starts poundin' hollerin' and screamin'. Sometimes the shark would go away... ...but sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you... ...right into your eyes. You know, a thing about a shark, he's got... ...lifeless eyes. Black eyes, like a doll's eyes. When he comes at you, he doesn't seem to be livin'... ...until he bites you. Those little black eyes roll over white and then... ...then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin'. The ocean turns red... ...in spite of the poundin' and the hollerin', they all come in. They rip you to pieces. You know, by the end of that first dawn... ...we lost 100 men. I don't know how many sharks. Maybe 1,000. I don't know how many men, they averaged six an hour. On Thursday mornin', I bumped into a friend of mine... ...Herbie Robinson, from Cleveland. Baseball player, bosun's mate. I thought he was asleep. Reached over to wake him up. He bobbed up and down in the water just like a kind of top. Upended. He'd been bitten in half, below the waist. Noon the fifth day, a Lockheed Ventura saw us. He swung in low and he saw us. He was a young pilot. Younger than Mr. Hooper. He saw us... ...and he came in low, and three hours later... ...a big fat PBY comes down and starts to pick us up. That was the time I was most frightened. Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a life jacket again. So, 1,100 men went into the water... ...316 men come out. The sharks took the rest June the 29th, 1945. Anyway, we delivered the bomb. What's that? It's a whale.

Fire her up! Put out the fire, will ya? - Pump her out. - Done. - Everybody on deck. - He ate the light. - Terrific. - Excuse me. Quint, what are you doing? Don't waste your time. What's wrong with this? Hooper, take the wheel. Brody, follow that. Watch for him. You okay? You okay? More left rudder. Pull your left hand down. I can't. It'll only go about three inches. All of our injectors got scored from the salt water in the fuel. Yeah, the housing's bent, you can hear it. Try the left rudder again. More left. Good. Once again now. There it is. What do you say, Chief? The barrel is up, it's right in the stern. I think he's right under the keg. Grab the boat hook. If we can get close enough... - ...I've got things on board that'll kill it. - Just want to goose him up. Come on. When he runs, you drop that rope or you'll lose your hands. I've seen fingers torn out at the knuckles. Whole sea's bones, full of 'em. Give it to me a minute. Haul in that line or it'll foul us. Start the engine. - Where are you goin'? - I'm gonna make a phone call. Hello, mayday, Orca. Coast Guard? Coast Guard, this is the Orca. Do you read me? Coast Guard, this is the Orca. Do you- Excuse me, Chief. That's great. That's just great. Now, where the hell are we? You're certifiable, Quint. You know that? You're certifiable. - You're certifiable, but I'll tell you this! - Boys. I think he's come back for his noon feeding. Hook me up another barrel. Bring her around after him. Full throttle. Get me right up alongside of him. I can't rev it up that high, it's not gonna take it. Five degrees port. All right, hold your course. Five degrees port now. Hold your course. - Fast fish. - Watch my hand. Be sure you watch my hand. Follow me. Follow me. Lad, you watch him now. Starboard. Starboard. Run him down. Hard aport. Watch him. Starboard. I can't believe it. Two barrels and he's going down again. It's incredible. - They're up again! - Now what? Why don't we lead the shark into shore instead of him leading us out to sea? Grab a couple of poles. Hang on now, we're going around. Into starboard. Easy. I'm gonna back her off now. Keep a watch on it, boys. Watch him. All right, gentlemen, snag them. Now then tie them to the stern cleats. Brody, bring your end around the cleat. That's right, it'll lock itself off. Give him room, Brody. Stay clear of the line. Watch it. Stand clear. Stand away from those stern cleats. Back home we got a taxidermy man. He gonna have a heart attack when he sees what I brought him. Throttle back. You're losing the cleats. My God, this one, too. They're both going. - He's eating his way through that line. - He's working his way right up to us. Come on, Quint. Hurry! Out of my way. Watch it. Untie this. He'll pull out the transom. Make it fast. I can't. It's trying to run. Pull, you son of a bitch! Go ahead. Pull your bloody heart out. It's impossible! We're breaking up! Cut it! Watch your hands! Cut it quick. I can't hold it! He can't stay down with three barrels on him. Not with three barrels, he can't. What about us? Get the pump out of the locker in front of you, will you? We're gonna sink, aren't we? Keep an eye on the barrels. Pump it out, Chief. Starting to go under. He can't with three barrels on him. Not with three he can't. You ever have one do this before? No. He's chasin' us. I don't believe it. I'm gonna draw him into the shallows. Draw him into the shallow water. I'm gonna draw him in and drown him. - We're headin' in, Brody. - Thank Christ! - You ever had a great white do that? - No. How far do we have to go? Don't put that much pressure on it. - Goddamn it. - Shut up. Get back there. Hold on. "Farewell and adieu to you, fair Spanish ladies "Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain "For we received order for to sail back to Boston" You idiot, you burned out the bearings. All right stop the boat. Stop the boat. Stop it. What exactly can you do with these things of yours? I think I can pump 20 cc of strychnine nitrate into him. If I can get close enough. Get this little needle through his skin? No, I can't do that. If I can get him close to the cage, I can get him in the mouth. - That shark'll rip that cage to pieces. - You got any better suggestions? Easy. Up she goes. Ain't got no spit. Try and keep him off me until I'm lower. Okay, okay, I'm ready. Bring him up, goddamn it. Bring him up now! Pull it up. Pull it. Come on, Quint, bring him in. It's giving way. Rig something! Got it? It's comin'. Slower. Show me the tank. Blow up! Smile, you son of a bitch! Quint? No. Can we get in on those? What day is this? It's Wednesday. It's Tuesday, I think. I think the tide's with us. Keep kicking. I used to hate the water. I can't imagine why.
