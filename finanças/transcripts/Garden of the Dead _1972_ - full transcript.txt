[music playing] [jazz music playing] [orchestral music playing] PRISON GUARD: Keep it moving. Keep it moving now. Come on now! All right, just get that formaldehyde into the truck. [grunts] PRISON GUARD: All right. Up. Up! PRISON GUARD: Keep it moving. Not much time now. Come on. [TALKING QUIETLY AMONGST THEMSELVES] One, two, three, four of them. PRISON GUARD: Where are you guys going? Keep working. Ew, I hate that smell. Formaldehyde has never hurt anyone. You ever embalm anyone, Doctor? Strictly for the undertakers. A wonder these old pipes haven't given away altogether. We don't have money for repairs. And anyway, they only have to last another three months. That'll be the end of this whole damn place. You'll be reassigned, Warden. No. There's no reassignment for me. My time is finished. Country clubs and [inaudible] they want now. This letter came from the Department of Correction this morning. They're all reassigned. Every guard, every prisoner, and you, Dr. Saunders. They said I'm not oriented enough in the new system. Oh, shit. PRISONER: Come on. PRISONER: You get me another piece. PRISON GUARD: Keep it moving. [sighs] [engine running] [inhales] [WHISPERING] Just take it. Take it [inaudible]. [bubbling] [all inhaling] Ah! [coughing] PRISONER: One more. Yes. [bubbling] [WHISPERING] Come on back [inaudible]. Yeah. [inaudible] Go on. [inaudible] [sighs] [sniffing and inhaling sharply] Ooh, yeah. [WHISPERING] Take it in. [bubbling] [whispering] We're getting outta here tonight, huh? Not if we stand around and talk about it, we won't. Yeah. [inaudible] [WHISPERING] Keep it down! You, [inaudible] get it. Take [inaudible]. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Hurry up. Keep guard. Let's go. Till I get outta here. There you go! [inaudible] Come on! Come on. Here, here. [inaudible] Oh shit. This'll pull it. PRISONER: Get it out. [WHISPERING] Phew. [inaudible] It's not long. [music playing] Yeah. [romantic music playing] Hi, Carol. Hello, Paul. Have they told you where you're going to be transferred to yet? No, not yet. The couple that owned the trailer court are gonna close it down and move on. I'm gonna have to find someplace else to live. I'll still see you every day, won't I? Well, it ain't no picnic driving out here every day, working that cafe, being felt up by salesmen and-- and truck drivers! Well, I was beginning to think that maybe, dammit, you liked it! Well maybe I do! Johnson! Come here. You got one minute. Go on. Don't spoil a good thing. You've got one minute. [romantic music playing] Carol. Oh! Oh, baby, I'm sorry! [CRYING] I love you so much! I love you, Carol. 15 seconds. [sobs] I needed you. I-- [inaudible]. Oh! Come on, Johnson, right now! Come on, move. I don't want to be late for work. Lousy hand. [inaudible] PRISONER: [clears throat] PRISONER: It's nice to know how we're gonna get out of here. I'll tell ya. [inaudible] Johnson, Williams, come. Down the other end of the barracks. Why? Do as I tell you. Unless you want to come with us. You can do more than hold that pretty little girl of yours. You can do it tonight. You can do it right. She sure is purty, isn't she? Come here. Come here. [WHISPERING] All right. Gonna make our way to the warehouse shed. Then we're gonna crawl through the tunnel to the bushes on the other side of the fence. Then it's just a short walk to the loading depot. OK? At exactly 9:30, when the lights-out whistle blows, I turn this key to the ignition of the flat bed. But McGee's out there right now. --[laughs] Who are you concerned about, McGee or us? McGee has a gun, we need a gun. Oh, I-- I remember, McGee let you hold your old lady for a little while. I see. [shouts] Stay where you are. That's right. Anybody that even smells like trouble in this break is dead. [inaudible] Mitchell. He knows rules. I hope they kill you, Bradock. Some of us deserve to be in here and some of us don't, but I hope they kill you. I'll choke him with my hands. No you won't. 'Cause there'll be a riot in here, and Bradock wouldn't want that. No. He's got a better use for all of you. Or he wouldn't have made your minds simple, feeding you all that formaldehyde vapor. Come on, Donovan. It's time to move. Ah! [jazz music playing] [WHISPERING] Nolan! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! [gunshot] -What was that? -Nolan. Come on! Get the warden. Check the barracks! All right you men, back to your bunks. Move it! This man's still alive. Bradock. Will some of you men give me a hand here, please? Yeah, right. Easy, easy. -Right here. -Over here. Come on, let's go. Get your gun. Get in the car. [inaudible]. Let's go. [siren wailing] It was an accident. It was an accident! It was an accident! It was an accident! You can go to hell, you little son of a bitch. [gunshot] [sirens wailing] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] Ahh! [shouting] [sirens wailing] [crashing] [gunshots] Ahh! [gunshots] [shouting and moaning] [inaudible]. Don't do it! No, no! [gunfire] These men don't deserve this, Warden. I'll decide that, Doctor. Right now, Cliff's in agonizing pain 48 hours longer than the rest of them. He too shall be tossed into shallow, unmarked grave without dignity, as they were. Now, the same thing goes for any of you who attempt to escape from this camp or any other camp you're transferred to. You six men knew of the escape, and yet you said nothing. You shall remain here for three days on bread and water. This sort of punishment was outlawed years ago, Warden. You shall stay here for four days, Mitchell. And I shall add one additional day for every word I hear from any of you! Officer McGee was murdered because you chose to say nothing! Take it away. [car drives away] Never seen such a fog or a chill like this. PRISON GUARD: Keep moving, there. Yes, Mr. Wilson. PRISON GUARD: Oh! Mr. Wilson? Mr. Wilson? Mr. Wilson? Jay. Jay! Jay! It won't let me go! Jay! Don't leave me! Don't leave me, Jay! Don't go away, Jay! Help, Jay! Help me, Jay, help me! Help me! Help me, Jay! Jay! [growling] [choking] [growling] Hey. [growling and grunting] We must have the liquid back in the can. We will destroy the living. We will destroy the living. [growling] [crying] Tell me he'll be all right! I love him so much! --[sighs] This will help you to sleep, Carol. I can't sleep thinking about Paul. Now, now, Paul's going to be all right. He was lucky. I'm going to have him transferred to the county hospital in a couple of days, and he'll get good treatment there. You'll be able to get an apartment in the city. Now, you just relax and this drug will take effect real soon. And when you awaken, this horrible nightmare will be all over. And you and Paul will be together again. All right? Thank you, Doctor. It's very nice of you to take care of Carol the way you did, Mrs. Fleming. Oh, that's all right. She couldn't stay alone in that old trailer she rented. Doesn't even have hot water. I'll stop in again tomorrow. Good night. Night. MRS. FLEMING: Ah! Ah! [screams] [growling and moaning] MRS. FLEMING: No! No! No! [screams] [crying] MRS. FLEMING: [screaming and crying] [screams] [zombies growling] MRS. FLEMING: [SCREAMING] No! [screams] [crying] [screams] [screams] [crying] [screams] [crying] [engine starts] [growling] That's good. [crying] Mrs. Johnson? What is it? What is it? What's the matter? What's the matter? [sobbing] But sir, the girl's in a bad way. I don't know what the situation is! You talk Jablonski to get back inside and lock the gate! And quick, damn quick! Yes sir. Jablonski, the warden wants you like back inside, right now! [zombies grunting] Bradock! Come on, Mrs. Johnson. PRISON GUARD: But the warden said-- To hell with what the warden said! You just lock that gate behind us! Come on, Mrs. Johnson. [sobbing] What's this all about, Jablonski? I don't know, Warden. I don't know if I can find the right words to tell you what I just saw. Why don't you just try? I looked like Bradock and maybe Nolan and Coler and Donovan, all of them just coming down the road. [sobbing] Take her to my office. Have Dr. Saunders look at her. Yes, sir. [sobbing] [buzz] Get the generator going! Yes, sir! What do you see out there? Just a broken powerline, Warden! Put a call in to the electric company. Yes, sir! This phone is dead, sir. All right. I'll call it from my office, then. PRISON GUARD: [screams] Get some light out here! PRISON GUARD: But there's no power here, sir! [generator clicking] [whirring] What caused it, Warden? I don't know. The phones are all out, too. Sergeant, I want every man to his emergency post. Yes, sir. Shall I send somebody out here to pick up his body? No. You take it back with you now. I want no one out here alone. Now, do you understand that? Yes, sir. Call your men. I want you to stay together. Keep your flashlights on the bushes along the sides of the road. PRISON GUARD: Yes, sir. Looks like somebody got to him with an axe. Bradock was carrying an axe. Don't talk foolish. Johnson's wife said a group of men attacked the trailer court tonight and killed a man and woman in the same way! Warden, believe me, I saw Bradock and the others! Issue every man two boxes of ammo. Yes, sir. Uh, Warden, what about the prisoners in the yard? So far, Jablonski, nothing has happened inside the camp. The prisoners stay where they are. I saw Bradock and the others! No, no! You saw somebody! So did I. But you didn't see any dead men! [grunting] [laughing] There's lots of tracks, sir. It looks like they all came inside. Sergeant, form search parties, each one taking a section of the camp. Yes, sir. Let one of us drive to town so we can call the Sheriff's station at Brightwood. There's nothing here we can't handle ourselves, Jablonski. Ahh! [zombies growling] Warden! Get us out of here! [men shouting] [gunshot] [zombies growling] [men shouting] That's Coler! Can't be Coler! That's Coler, I tell you! Can't be Coler! [growling] [gunfire] All right, you men! Get back to your posts! It's Coler. Yes. [moaning and screaming] The light! The light! That light on him. The light is killing him! [screaming] My god! My-- -Warden! ---god! Warden, all the vehicles are useless! Useless? What are you talking about? [growling] [screaming] Jablonski. Get your youngest and fastest man. Get him to run in the direction of Brightwood. Tell the sheriff there we need assistance. Yes, sir. --[inaudible], get that rudder going. Yes, sir. All right, you men, hit the floor. Shoot, Warden! For God's sake, shoot! A shotgun at close range is our only chance. [gunshot] Ahh! [moans] Get those men out to the generator plant. Why there? They'll be safe there. That building's made of reinforced concrete. -Warden! -Yes? I sent Bob Linford. He was a long-distance runner in high school. Damn! Damn! Give me those keys, quickly. Here, take this. There's something around us, Warden! You back off. And keep your-- keep your flashlight on the compound. Yes, sir. What's this about Bradock, Donovan, and-- and Coler? Now, look. I'm gonna unchain you men. I want you to run to the generator plant, and I want you to remain there. Remain there with the rest of them. [shouts] [gunshot] The warden's dead. Help me carry him to his room. Yeah. Yeah. [whirring] Quick, get in here. Get in here. Come on, move it. [groaning and growling] [laughing] Oh! Help me get him to the couch, please. We can't stay here, Doctor. Why not, Jablonski? Because these old walls won't keep them out. You'd better let Johnson rest for awhile. Sorry for what I said the other day. So am I. [crash] [glass shattering] --[inaudible], get that light down and put it in the power plant! Let's shine it on the front door over here. They won't go near the beam of that light. Decomposes them almost instantly. Give us some protection while we're walking over to that generator plant. We'll be safe then. Sergeant Burns, get out there and cover the guards while they're getting the light down. BURNS: Yes, sir. Wait a minute. You help too. Just about. I got it. Let it go. [shouting] [gunshot] Come inside! Mitchell! [grunting] Get that generator going! They're [inaudible] generators! [generator clicking] [whirring] [zombies grunting] Come on. [whirring] They had their chance, but they didn't harm you. They-- they just stared at you. Oh, they'd've harmed her soon as-- How the hell you know that? Because I had to listen to their stories every night. How they'd look at her by the fence. Then they'd tell me how they'd like to touch her. But first they'd've looked. Carol, listen to me. You gotta go out there to them. [groaning] Show us the girl! Send her out! Shoot, Carol, shoot! [gunfire] [groaning and grunting] [crying] [music playing]
