[dramatic music] [electronic beeping] - Commander, can you come here? There's something happening on our perimeter. An unidentified spaceship has penetrated our defenses. - Flanagan, Maya. What's going on? - This is unit P of reconnaissance reporting the sighting of an alien vessel. A flying saucer. They're maintaining full radio silence, they don't reply to any of our signals. The velocity of their ship is much superior to my craft. I'm sending Johnson out after, then a new hunter. That's the best we can do, sir. Let's just hope he manages to catch them... - He can try to force it to land but if they won't, he should return to his launching module. It's possible their intentions are hostile. [whooshing and beeping] [banging] [beeping] - Lord Kes, an indigenous space vehicle of a primitive chemically propelled design is attempting to force us to reduce velocity. - Destroy it. Insert central computer link into defense system circuits. Hurry! Linking circuit. - A central A 74 beta stock and disintegrated by a destructive ray impossible to identify. Alien vessel has passed out of belt perimeter defenses and is now rapidly approaching automatic inner defense ring of earth. Propellant energy source not yet identified, automatic system on emergency in tracking and aiding phase. Alien vessel now entering K sector five, in 10 seconds, it will be in range of atomic cannon. - Man meets an alien race at last. And greets them by disintegrating their vessel. - Atomic cannon, crossfire now under way. The object has been struck. - Commander Barr, - Quiet Hollywood. You are witnessing mankind's first contact with an alien race. - Yes, and I'm ready to shake their hand. - Alien vessel undamaged. - What? - And proceeding rapidly direction earth. Atomic cannon's ineffectual. - Impossible. - This is red emergency all sectors status three ready to open up. - At that velocity, they're already beyond sections 83. - And they'll be drawing within range of our hyper radar any minute now and the earth based artillery. [beeping] - Approaching Soul Three atmosphere rich in oxygen, three is up, all with little discomfort. Wide spread traces of pollution, due to chemical combustion and nuclear wastes. Analysis of magnetic and heat radiation, reveals technological level approximately equivalent to the Axis Culture 18 centuries ago. Bionic radiation analysis reveals planet population to be approximately 10 billion units. Infra-red scanners show that almost all industrial and residential structures are below ground or on the sea bed. This appears to be due to the necessity of freeing the surface for agricultural use. There are in addition vast areas of both land and sea dedicated to breeding and raising lower forms of life to serve as nutrients for the higher forms. - Soul Three is even better than I thought it was when I bought it? [tense music] [spacecraft roaring] [gun firing] [banging] - It seems they want to show a force, it will be extremely impolite of me to disappoint them. [exploding] - Numbers of survivors, zero. The [mumbles] installation's totally destroyed. - They're continuing to destroy all our military bases. After they knocked out London, they started on Accra. - There are no survivors Adelaide and Tokyo sub says the Okinawa base is just a junkyard. - The laboratories have nearly finished examining all the available data. But the news has leaked out. I can't hold off the report as much longer in spite of the lack of official information, the papers are already talking about an invasion. It'll take a miracle to save us now. - If anyone can work miracles, Professor Murray can. - Professor Murray, who's he? - Murray is a truly exceptional scientist. He has a degree of intelligence that puts him about two centuries ahead of everyone else. - Why isn't he working with us? - Because he's too independent, stubborn, and undisciplined. He won't accept any kind of authority, but in a situation like this, he's the only person who can do anything. - Why not get in touch with him? - The problem is that my relationship with the professor could not be described as ideal. The last time I asked for his help, he was so difficult to get along with, I had to arrest him. - He can't have liked that. - Quite. At the moment the only person that he might listen to is a young Lieutenant, Oliver Carrera. - Aaaaah! Hollywood, that fellow who acts as if he were a superstar in a TV series called "Fighting Hero of the Galaxy"? - Him, the only one who could possibly help. Holly spends most of his spare time at the professor's. Has a young niece, he's playing up to. Professor Murray lives at the ecology laboratory on the serial ratings and passes the time, turning out inventions that are incredible. - Flanagan, I can't hold these reporters back anymore. - Don't worry, I'll take care about a howling mob. You have to go on a very important mission. [tense music] - Enthirium, the alien craft is protected with an armor of pure enthirium. - That's impossible. - What makes it impossible dear? Just because we on earth only have a kilo of enthirium, but we know nothing about conditions prevailing on the aliens galaxy. Earth has a lot of iron and their planet might be made of enthirium. - But uncle, enthirium is practically indestructible. - And this spaceship is proof. Our nuclear artillery didn't even scratch the surface. Evidently the enemy craft has traveled from a far corner of the universe over a vast distance in order to arrive here. It's not surprising they managed to swat down that ridiculous insect of a space on that command post sent to greet them. - Oh uncle, you really shouldn't laugh like that. Our planet may be in very serious danger. - Oh I'm not laughing about it at all Irene. My dear, these aliens have several centuries advantage over us. They travel out of space through the galaxies while we are unable to get any farther than the planets of our own sun. They possess an untold quantity of enthirium. And in all probability consider us savages, hardly worth bothering about. - Technologically they may be ahead of us, but I think that... - Just a minute. - I'm sorry. [high-pitch resonating music] - They're barbarian. They don't place any sort of value on human life. - But you're forgetting how the white man behave towards the negro and the American Indian. It is the most powerful race, which makes the decision as to who's civilized and who's not. And I'm afraid we will have to accept our inferiority and submit to the inevitable. [upbeat music] Enthirium I never would have imagined that I'd have to go back to my research on enthirium. [spacecraft engine resonating] [spacecraft roaring] [lightning roaring] - Good evening. - Oh Holly, at last. - My name is Oliver in case you forgot. - No darling, please, excuse me. I mustn't be informal. This visit is official. - Since the visiting hero so anxious to maintain his command, I suppose there's no use offering him a drink. - Good lord! What's that? - It's an old house robot that uncle built ages ago. It had a short circuit in it's electronic brain and acts a little peculiar. Why don't you fix it uncle? - I could never find the time. Anyway, I've forgotten how it works [laughing]. He may not speak very distinctly, but he's a superb bartender. - Professor Murray, we're faced with disaster. Three of our bases are already in ruins and we were completely helpless. No doubt you've heard the latest news bulletin. - According to the official news, the situation is under control. What do you want with me? - Commander Barr has entrusted me with the most... - No, I know, I know that. You already said your visit was official. So I can easily imagine what kind of heroic mission Commander Barr has entrusted you with. To persuade that old fool, Murray. - To help him out. - I must say your Commander Barr, certainly has the nerve. After putting my uncle in prison, he still thinks he's entitled to ask his help. - Yes. - But the whole point of the matter is that there's no way I can avoid giving you the assistance you need, since I have to live on this earth myself, as does my charming niece. I'll do what I can. But on my conditions only. - No conditions Murray. I'm not authorized to agree to conditions of any type. You can do whatever you want, but don't expect any support officially. If anyone gets burned, I'd rather the anyone was you naturally. I don't hesitate to admit preferring your discomfort to my own. - You've had a taste of it already Barr. - It was an unavoidable necessity. And you know it. Now, all you have to do is to tell me if you're going to help us or if we'll have to surrender. That means he'll help us. Holly's done a good job. I don't know how he manages, but he does. I burn my fingers and he warms his hands. - I don't understand. Was there some kind of trouble between you and the commander? - Oh, it's a long story. I'll tell you one of these days. It also concerns a couple of friends of mine. Sean and Bridget, among the greatest chemists living. - Why haven't you ever mentioned there being friends of yours? - I believe they're in a penitentiary, at the moment base. Right. Now somebody will have to get them out of the penitentiary. And I know just the person to do it. - Don't look at me, sir. I'd have to get an authorization. And I don't think Commander Barr... - It must happen! At base GA they've managed to discover that the alien vessel is made entirely of enthirium. - That's supposed to be a secret. - Are you surprised that I know? Frankly, I'm astonished that the base managed to discover it too. And only Sean and Bridget could possibly succeed in inventing an entirely new substance that could perforate enthirium, but the two of them are in the penitentiary. - Apparently it's a vicious circle. It's impossible to get out of it. - Not necessarily. Say a certain lieutenant, were to join forces with a person I know who's very clever with locked doors. The two of you could free them easily, - But an act such as that is strictly against the law. Assisting criminals to get out? No, never. That would mean betraying my duty as a soldier. And that you can't expect of an honest man. - No, no. And I can't force you. What I expect is that you would volunteer to handle it. - But that's ridiculous, you must be joking. I couldn't possibly [upbeat music] Yeah. You're right. Of course I'll do it. Professor I volunteer to handle it. - You've done it again. It's very unfair of you. - I must have Sean and Bridgette, and Dirk and Norman And as for them, you'll have to track them down for me. Wouldn't you? [electronics beeping] - Six! I've won! [laughing] I've won! I've defeated you in the sixth game and you my love would have to change sooner or later. Pay up, come on. I'm afraid you really were very unlucky. The law of probability was certainly on your side [scoffs]. Oh, Dirk. [calming piano music] - I just don't understand it. I had all the winning numbers, but she won. - Huh, very lucky girl. - You know I never thought I was going to win Laramie. Dirk Laramie you brought me luck. - Hey, listen you. - Can't you see I'm busy? - You are Dirk Laramie, aren't you? The gambler who hypnotizes opponents. - Look, I'm busy. Let's talk about it later. - Hey boys, this is Dirk Laramie, the guy who can see through cards. I think he oughtta give back the money he won off of. That's him. Hey, there. - Just a moment, darling. - You're gonna hand over that cash to us? - Here! - Oh! [punches and kicks thudding] [upbeat music] [groaning] - So you were here too, huh? I'll bet you were hitting me harder than the others. - [laughing] No I'm afraid I didn't have that pleasure, but I did enjoy the performance. [groaning] Tonight at the usual place. [laughing gently] She won't keep the appointment. A couple of guardians caught her just as she was trying to slip quietly away unfortunately. - What are you doing here? - I certainly didn't drop in to say hello. It was my uncle who asked me to look for you. And I'm afraid there was no way I could refuse. He wants to have a talk with you immediately. It's urgent. - Oh, he does, he wants to see me? Look... - He said for you to come right over to his place without wasting a moment. - Huh! Does he think I'm going to come running every time he snaps his fingers? Like that little toy soldier of yours? - Don't be like that. This thing is very important. - Oh, I'm sure it's extremely important. [soothing piano music] What a shame you've gotten worse, Irene. You used to kiss a lot better. It's the fault of that soldier, Holly. - Dirk, how many days have you been in here? - Well, two, three, I don't know. - Then you know nothing about what's happening in the world. - Why, what's happening? [laughing gently] They assassinated the president? - Why not come and see? - Mmh, I guess I should. I'm ready. - Good morning professor. - Huh, good morning, Dirk. Won't you sit down. Jeeves? [robot squeaking] - He's asking you if you like ice and soda in your whiskey? - No, thank you. I prefer it neat. - I take it Irene has already told you everything. - Not exactly. Again, explaining one or two things. Apparently, it was more important to find some guy called, Norman. - If you want me to go to the penitentiary at moon space, I must have a spacecraft. - Yes, fortunately it happens that there is a junior officer here on the station who's an old friend of ours, Oliver Carrera. Known as Hollywood. - Aaah! - And they willing to help out? - I've already awakened his interest in the operation. - All you have to do is prevent him from changing his mind. With your unusual talent, I'm sure you will have no difficulty gaining his cooperation in borrowing one of the Navy's vessels for our use. Do you follow me? - I sure do. It's just like old times. And when your mission is finished and you've returned the spacecraft to the base, Oliver won't remember anything. - Always assuming that we managed to get away with Sean and Bridgette. - Oh you'll make it, all right. I have every confidence, I know you Dirk. [robot beeping and squeaking] - You know professor, I missed you. [robot squeaking] [spacecraft engine resonating] [device beeping] - Turn monitor one on the slave pickup operation in the subtropical continent. - Yes, sir. - 1,600 dark skin units of various age groups have been collected. All damaged or physically unsuitable elements have been destroyed, leaving a sample group of 1000 strong healthy individuals. ♪~ This group has had two hours in data chamber to destroy all pathogenic bacteria. They are now undergoing suspended animation processing prior to stowage in hole six, container four. [upbeat music] - Hey, Holly! Holly! [upbeat music] Hey, Holly. - I am Lieutenant Oliver J. Carrera. You see this star? It's a medal, for galactic bravery. - Oh, I trust the Lieutenant will accept my apologies. My name is Dirk Gordon Laramie III Dirk Laramie? I think we've already met. - [laughing] You have a very good memory. Listen, Holly, I'm sorry. I have something important to tell you. It's from the professor. - But how did you manage to get in? Civilians aren't allowed on the base. You better get out. - No, wait, just a minute, Lieutenant till you've heard my message. It's from the old man, get it? He sent me. - What old man? - Huh, you don't remember? Professor Murray. - Murray? What does he want from me? - Well he said for you to help me. So they lend us something. - Lend? Lend what? - A spaceship. I just need it for a day or two and when they finish using it, you can give it back. Huh? You're the only person that can help us. And Professor Murray said he was certain you could do it. - You're out of your minds. Both of you. I'm handing you over to the guard. - No, wait a minute Lieutenant. Don't do anything you might live to regret. Think of Irene. - Irene? - Yes, Irene - I have to think of my duty. Duty comes before anything else. - That's right, duty first. - And stealing is against my principles as a soldier. No one can force me to... [Oliver breathing heavily] - No one wants to force you. I'm waiting for you to volunteer. - Of course, of course. If it's what the professor wants, I'll gladly volunteer. - Come on. - Follow me. [calm flute music] Urgent mission, I must lift off at once - Present your permit. And has the civilian with you got a base-pass? - Of course he has. Show him your pass. - All right. [punch thudding] Let's go. Galactic hero. - Who's that idiot blasting off without flight clearance? - I don't know. There aren't any scheduled flights today. - Where to? - Moon Space, the Alcatraz of the heavens. There are two birds in that gilded cage that we have to set free. [upbeat music] [spacecraft roaring] [feet stumping floor] - Not bad looking that bridge of London, eh? I'll take over. - Hercules leaves Norman dazed but standing. Oh, I spoke too soon. No, he's back on his feet. This is an exceptional match. - Sure I'll bet you. - You don't know what you're talking about. Don't do this to yourself... - But, let me finish. - Hercules, Thor and Bill Norman, are struggling for the title in the Android versus Human World Championship. Hercules Thor has killed over a thousand opponents, and given a new meaning to the word, "Box". That's what the other guys can call him. Norman is putting up a fire defense but it's not easy for him to make [crowd cheering drowns out speaker] [punch thudding] [helmet beeping] He did it. One, two, three, four. [growling] we're still on the seventh round of this spectacular battle. [crowd cheering] [crowd cheering drowns out speaker] - Kill him! [crowd cheering drowns out speaker] - Hercules is on the attack. Now he got a rope. That could get a little confusing here. Norman may have [crowd cheering drowns out speaker] The referee is beginning to weaken, [crowd cheering drowns out speaker] [punches and kicks thudding] [crowd cheering drowns out speaker] [helmet beeping] - One, two, three. - Hercules is on his feet but swinging wildly. [soft jazz music] - 3000. - I'll stay. - Well, you're playing or not? - Jeff, hey Jeff. Don't forget you're in a game. - Jeff wake up, it's your play we're waiting. - Oh, sorry, where are we? - 3,000 - And I am staying in. - 5,000 - No - 20 - Too much for me, well. - You like to play for high stakes? - I'm sorry I do too high. - I'll see ya, two aces. - It's all yours. Lucky bastard. - Have you had enough? - I've had enough. - That was at the breaks, just luck. - Too much for me. - Just two aces? - But how could you know that I was bluffing? [loud laughter] - Damian - I have all the winning numbers now except one. Why go on, what's the point? You might as well give in graciously and come to bed. - Not yet, you still haven't won. Everything depends on final game. - If I lose you get all the money and the pleasure of a night with me. But if I win, you lose everything. The money and my body. - Quite right. Let's play another one. [electronics beeping] - It happened. - That's a matter of purely academic interest to us now. What counts is that It really did happen. And now we have to do something. Flanagan, contact all up division satellites and bases and have them transmit any pictures they've managed to get of this ufo, immediately. - Yes, sir. - Holly. - Yes, sir. - I want you to get me a spectrograph analysis from the chief of the observatory. - Yes, sir. - I need to know the substance the spacecraft is composed of and why it was resistant to our nuclear Canon attack. - Yes sir - We are in serious trouble. Perhaps the computer could make an analysis from the existing data. That's just a faint hope it can, at least in terms of probable choices, because it's absolutely vital to know immediately the defense systems used on the ufo. - I'll find out commander. - Ladies and gentlemen, the auction is now open. [background chattering] - And to begin the sale, Troll a seventh category planet with an unbreathable atmosphere, surrounded by asteroids bearing rich deposits of valuable minerals. Sun, class G. - I bid one million credit. - A million credits. Lord Sin of Sastria, bids one million credits for this valuable property, with its immense natural resources. Do I hear a better offer? Gone to Sin of Sastria for one million credits. The next item on offer is Horva Four A third category a planet. Abounding in surface lichens and other forms of plant life on the sea bed. - Two million credits. - Three million. - Five million. - Lord Gad of Tokol, bids five million credits. Do I hear a higher bid? Going, going, gone to Gad of Tokol for five million credits. Congratulations Lord Gad, you've got a bargain there. - Life is more spread in the universe. But I've been reliably informed that today they are auctioning a small planet on the edge of the galaxy. With humans on it - Farcus 15, rich in talium, - Homo sapiens? - Slaves, millions of slaves, just waiting to have their thoughts erased. Clearly by some person with sufficient ships to transport. - Will no one offer 2 million credits? Very well the planet is withdrawn from the sale. - You can sell some to me, I'll pay a thousand credits each. - It's a deal, provided Golden Taco doesn't succeed in outbidding us with the aid of the Octoneous. - And now Lords of the galaxy, the main item of today's sale, Soul Three. It has rarely been my privilege to put such a remarkable world on the block. It is a third category planet belonging to a class B sun. It's known as, Earth. - Six million. - 12 million credits - Soul Three is immensely rich in every type of life, animal, bacteria and plants. All in various stages of evolution. The gravity factor is 1.3. The atmosphere breathable. But in addition to all this, it is teaming with the rarest of all life forms, humans. - 20 million credits. - I bid 30 million. - 32 million. - 50 million. 50 million credits for Soul Three. Will anyone go higher? - 60 million - You again? - Do I hear a higher bid? - 70 million. - 70 million for Soul Three. - Why don't you go to 100 million? I can get it. - 100 million. Kess of Koba has bid 100 million credits. - Do I hear a higher offer? Going for 100 million credits, to Kess of Koba for 100 million credits. [tense music] [crowd murmuring] - Let him live, Kess of Koba or you will violate the high law. - If anyone wants slaves, you can place an order at my house during the next router. But do not delay. I shall depart for Soul Three on the 1st, August [voiceover] [spacecraft engine resonating] [woman groaning] - Thanks for reanimating me. - If you wanna thank me, there's an easy way to do it. - I think I know what it is. Too terrible evolving under the freeze ring for a lone hearted girl. I know how to be nice to a man I like. I can make the right person feel all kinds of pleasure and thrills. And you are the kind of person I go for. I'm tired of waiting. I need [mumbles] I'm dying for a man. [both moaning] [spacecraft engine resonating] [punches and kicks thudding] [man yelling] - Emergency squad to sector 4, attempted breakout. Emergency squad to sector 4. Attempted breakout. All available wards will report to sector 4 and restore order. [men groaning and growling] - It's a good thing you're not from the department. I've just had to clear a full-scale emergency to stop a breakout. Naturally it's always the same two detainees who ruin things. That damn Bridget and Sean. [yelling] Right, come on. I ruined the day I let them into my penitentiary. They've tried to escape four times. They cause nothing but trouble. But I can tell you they're going to be very sorry, because I shall transfer the two of them to a prison asteroid. And they can rot in solitary confinement. [cries in pain] But of course this is of no interest to you. It's just my problem. And I feel I've neglected to ask you, how can I be of assistance? And that is to say, what is the reason for your visit? - I'll come right to the point. [tense music] [man growling painfully] [crowd cheering drowns speaker] - Someone's up. Someone's down. One, two, wait till he gets up. - Norman's back but Hercules answers backwards with deadly accuracy. [crowd cheering drowns speaker] Now Norman is launching one of his spectacle [crowd cheering drowns the speaker] Hercules, how long can he stand it? [crowd cheering drowns the speaker] And another. Hercules Thor is down. [crowd cheering drowns the speaker] - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. He's out! The winner! The winner! [crowd cheering] - I've won. I found the winner. - Where's the money? Let's go, 40 dollars [voiceover] - Here they are. Our two model prisoners. Bridget Landon and Sean James. Well, my dears and these two gentlemen have come all the way here just for you. I'd like to introduce you. - I think we're gonna skip the introduction. - Naturally, naturally to continue, I propose that we reward the good conduct and excellent behavior that has made your a mentor to all the prisoners on moon space. And so I intend to, I intend to, I intend to to shorten your sentences by the remaining 78 years and release you in the custody of these two gentlemen, who will escort you back to earth. - It's crazy of you Irene to bet all that money on me, but I sure am glad to see you again. It must be years since the last time we met. - I knew you'd win the fight. My uncle says nobody can fight like you can. Whenever anybody talks about fighting he always mentions you. - He needs your help, Norman. - And where I'm afraid that we're all going to be needing a lot of help because of that flying saucer. - But I heard the news report about it. They said the situation was completely under control by now. - It's not true. That's why uncle is reforming the old team. And of course that includes you. - If the professor needs me, that's okay, but I want to bring along a couple of friends. They could be very useful. [machine roaring] - I don't understand. There isn't a living soul around here. - But I never mentioned living souls, Irene. Hey, look in that pile of junk that's one of them. Come on. [scrap clanging] - You've made me wait nearly five hours over this. Uncle will be furious. - Take it easy Irene. You'll soon see that your five hours haven't been wasted. Okay, now replace the power unit. You take micro batteries, two, down here. There, perfect. Say something, Tilt. - Damn you, Norman! You interfering, warm blooded animal. Who authorized you to reactivate me? Why can't two poor robots commit suicide in peace, without some meddling human recharging their circuits? - Tilly and I wanted to put an end to it all because, now let me see, why was it exactly? Anyway, you should have kept out of it. - What's that noise? Oh, wait, it's her starting the journey to the eternal nothings. Hurry, there's not a minute to lose. If you don't want me to go to pieces again, you must save her. Quick, before her tender 10 limbs are crushed like kitchen foil in a cruel machine. Oh Tilly, my precious Tilly. [upbeat music] He won't make it in time. Tilly. Tilly my darling, light of my transistors. Tilly, sweet little Tilly. Thank heaven, he made it in time. She's beautiful, isn't she? - Oh yes, she's really beautiful. - We're engaged you know. We love each other deeply. - Quick Norman, get the trash off her. [scrap clanking] It's such an indignity for her, mixing with junk from such low class machines. Hurry! Hurry! No doubt you came provided with fresh micro batteries for her too. - Ahuh. - Tilly, my treasure. Are you all right? - Tilt my dear, is that you? Are we in robot heaven? I expected something different. - No Tilly, we're not dead. We've been reactivated. - Oh darling, I wondered if I'd ever see you again. - I'm sorry our suicide pact was a failure. It was such a romantic idea. And I know how hard you tried to make it work. - I don't mind Tilt, one can't have everything in life. - By the way Tilly, I must have a splinted crystal in my memory bank. I can't remember why we made a suicide pact. - You can't remember? Oh Tilt how can you beat the one feeling? It was because, let me see. It was because we decided to end it all. - Yes, but why? - Why? Oh dear, I can't remember either. - And you really think that these two funny little robots can actually be of some use to us? - Don't judge them by appearances. They're full of surprises. Tilt once got man out of a very tricky situation. He's able to project an energy field around his plating so that moving objects pass through without touching. These two units were designed as one of a series of far out experiments to see if they could create robots with human emotions. They were only partially successful. However, there are several areas where they produce quite unexpected results. Now I'll demonstrate to you how Tilt can cope with any adversary. It's extraordinary. I'll try to hit him with this pole. Just watch. - Hey, Tilt! - What is it? Can't you see I'm busy? - On guard! - Are you crazy? - No, it's all right. Just kidding. - Kidding, he calls it. - Tilly, where are you going? Wait. - The acceleration is so rapid it appears to vanish and they can evidently reach a velocity of several parsecs. All these clips we've been looking at were collected by our space observatories and just before earth ball, the saucer disappeared from our radar. So they must be using a scrambler. - Commander, the alien vessel has landed near Hiroshima and captured over 800 people. - This is the 24th raid they've carried out. Starting with those farmers in United Africa. Then the Arabs, the Russians, and now the Japanese. If word of this gets out we'll have panic over the entire planet. Lloyd get working on the computer and start to prepare an accurate map of all the places that alien vessel has landed. Then see if you can determine any logic on the basis of which the aliens chose those places. And discover their next probable objective. - I'll try it. - If we succeed, I have decided to prepare an atomic ambush for the aliens. - Maybe we wanted to die because we felt old and out of date. - Oh no! 130 isn't old for a robot. And we're still very bright and shiny. I think it was because I wanted to have children. - Great integrated circuits. What's that thing? Look Tilly, a prehistoric cave robot. - I've never seen anything so ugly! - I say creatures like this shouldn't be allowed to run around loose. They ought to be kept in zoos. - Now Tilt, that's just prejudice. He has as much right to activate as we have. Even if his tin is a different color. - The situation is desperate. The government consists of men who are completely unimaginative. So if we want the world to survive, we have to do the job ourselves. Our chief hope lies in Sean and Bridgette. They've been studying the structure of Enthirium for many years, but their reasons for doing so are highly personal and couldn't properly be defined as scientific. [men laughing] - As far as that goes, we had some help from a boxer by the name of Norman. And a gambler called Dirk Laramie. Both of whom are now playing innocent. - My illusion was to the case of the 128 tons of synthetic gold. The quantity which could easily have destroyed the economic equilibrium of the entire world. Had it ever reached the open market. - 128 tons of synthetic gold? - 128 tons, that's right. The scandal didn't die down for years, but unfortunately I had no choice, but to withdraw from politics. - Now just a minute professor, we weren't only thinking of ourselves, you know. - We planned things so that our friends would also... - Get in trouble with you? That's all water under the bridge. What counts is that our whole team has been reformed once more. And now let's get back to the enthirium. How far did you get with your research? - We completed the analysis of its molecular structure. - If we'd add a few more months, we would have been able to synthesize it under laboratory conditions. - That's excellent. Now you have to continue. You must find a weak point in the molecular structure of enthirium, that would lead to its disintegration and destruction. Do you think you can do it? - Well, we can always try. - Just tell me what equipment you need and you can start work right away. - Well, we can use your old laboratory, but there's one essential item that you haven't got. - A few grams of enthirium. - If that's all you need, there's no problem. - This container holds pure enthirium. You can imagine how difficult it was to come by. - Then we're all set. - Professor, what are the rest of us supposed to do? - For the moment, your duty is to ensure the safety of Sean and Bridgette. - You didn't need space pilot like us to do that? - Of course not, but you can't really go into action until we have a suitable weapon. Our space feed has already tried using conventional weapons against these aliens, atomic canons, lasers, and so on, but they've been quite useless. At the moment, we are in the same condition as the ignorant Savage who tries to attack a nuclear tank with a bow and arrow. [spacecraft engine resonating] [electronic beeping] - Send a message to Koble, to accelerate the preparation of cargo vessels. At the rate we're going we'll soon have goods to fill at least 10. - Yes sir. - Check the surrounding area on the monitor to see if there's any activity on the part of the indigenous troops. - Instructions followed. - What's that? I just felt the contact with an alien brain. A very powerful one. Strange, it's the first time this happened on this planet. [groaning] [tense music] - Perhaps I wanted to die because you were getting too friendly with that "Speak your weight" machine. - Isn't that just like a woman? - Now don't pull macho stuff with me. You male chauvinist robot. - I didn't mean it like that. It's just that if you get jealous every time I wink at a cute calculator... - Who said anything about jealousy? It's a question of robots' dignity. - Have it your way but let's not argue about it. - I'm not arguing, you are the one who's arguing. - Careful, you don't make those holes too deep. Otherwise the electromagnetic discharge won't be violent enough. [upbeat music] - Listen Tilly, I've written a poem for you. Wanna hear it? It's called "passion in a printed circuit". [upbeat music] - Damn it [mumbles] It has no effect, another failure. [tense music] - There's been a reduction in the aliens' activities. They stopped taking prisoners after Japan. It could mean they run out of space. - And they've decided to return to their own planets. - Unfortunately, it's a most probable hypothesis because in all likelihood they will return in greater force. And we are still defenseless. There's absolutely nothing we can do to stop them. - Sean and Bridgette are continuing with their experiments, but they haven't had any positive results. Well, I'm gonna take some food to the boys outside. They must be starving. - Be sure to give them an equal ration. - I know, you know, Holly, he'd never dreamed of accepting preferential treatment over the other. - I was really thinking more of Dirk. Would he accept it? - Get it through your head uncle, between Dirk and me, it's all over. Here, come and give me a hand. [tense music] [woman screaming] - I think I heard a scream. - I didn't. You probably got an overloaded imagination circuit. - Hey Bob, hurry. - I got you, sir. - Not to me you fool, to him. - Oh yes, him. [foreign language] - Have you guys gone crazy? If we had the time, I'd call you before a court martial. [murmuring] - Be quiet. Can you hear that noise, that sounded like a scream? - Perhaps it was her brain I felt that contact with, but there is no way to tell until she regains consciousness. - Go and capture the others. - A stroll in the woods is very romantic, but I wish you'd stroll a little faster. - Come on. - Why don't we curve our names on a tree? You know, hearts. - No, we can't do that because a tree is a living thing, and the law of robotics won't let robots damage living things. - We can only damage each other like the way you hurt me by flirting with that automatic shoe polisher. - Me? With the short machine? Never. - Shhh! What's that? Someone's coming. - Tilt, I'm frightened. They must be the aliens. - Cut out your anxiety circuits and keep calm. I'll protect you. - Oh, Tilt. [upbeat music] How rude! They didn't even look at us. - There must be some reason. I'll process the data on my probability computer. We better warn the others. Come on. - Yes, you're right. Let's go. - They're here, they're here! - Who's here? Who do you mean, Tilly? - The extraterrestrial. - You don't mean the aliens? - Yes, we just saw them in the woods coming this way. - Quick Tilt, you better go and warn the others. Tell them Tilly you and I are waiting back here. - I'm on my way. - Open fire when I give you the order! - The hero was taking command of the operation. All right men, fire! [laser-gun resonating] [banging] [swords clanking] - Advance to the rear. Strategic withdrawal. Let's get out of here. - We're in real trouble, Holly. We can't hold them up very long. - Listen you two, go and warn the professor. - Okay, come on Tilly. - Fall back quick. To the house! - Professor, the alien invaders are overwhelming our defending forces. - I'm aware of it. - Holly wants to know what they should do? - I think you'd better warn Sean and Bridgette. [upbeat music] [woman screaming in background] [female laughing in background] [groaning] - I can feel that person searching again and it's not the girl. It's a brain of great intelligence. - [mumbles] [explosives exploding] - Well, the bombs hardly even slow them down. [swords clanking] - Aha! - Hey you guys, I just found out that they're Androids and Androids are nearly invulnerable. Yeah, But with this sword I was able to knock out eight. That means we finally got a weapon we can fight them with. - Everyone take these pills. - It's an interesting device, this sword. I wonder what the principle... [body thudding floor] - Tilt, I'm frightened. - Don't worry, darling. They're Androids, didn't you hear? They're only programmed to capture humans? You see, they're not even aware of us. We're perfectly safe. - There's no trace of life in these bodies. They've auto-destructed. Give the information to Lord Kes. - Auto destructed, yet I still sense the presence of that other brain. Put the brain lock on her and set her free. She will be our weapon. Return aboard. [robot squeaking] - We got away with it Professor Murray. Thanks to Sean and Bridgette with those pills of theirs, that made everybody look dead. We fooled them. - They went away because they thought we were dead, but those creatures aren't human. They're Androids. - I saw the evidence with my own eyes. One of them broke in two and he was all filled with gears and wires and electronic stuff. - So they're Androids! That means be life is relatively rare on their world. - Norman has succeeded in getting hold of one of their weapons. I feel sure that if I analyze it, I could make copies of it. And even find a lead to the secret of anti-enthirium. - Back to the lab then and get on with it. - Right. - Come on Bridgette. - I too have a little surprise for the invaders. If it works, it may be the answer to our problems. Now I have to concentrate. [tense music] - Section one? - All clear sir. - Section two? - All clear sir - Someone is preventing our lift off with a telepathic net. It's quite incredible to find such a brain on a planet at this stage of evolution. I can't believe it. - I feel brain-active. His normal capacity is much superior to what mine is. What I don't understand is, he's capable of destroying me, but he's probing very profoundly. With every possible precaution. His mental pause are most frightening. I'm trying to hold on. No. [groaning] [sighing] I did it, he's withdrawn. - Yes? - Boss, listen carefully partner, I have discovered an incredible thing here. One of these earth people has a mental force similar to ours. After making our collection of samples, I prepared for departure, but a telepathic net is keeping me blocked on the ground. - Erase his mind and return. - Pity! What an opportunity to dominate the galaxy. If we sold slaves like this, we could destroy our competition and control the entire market. - With one, how? - Analyzing his mental powers. I could construct a brain Pattern and imprint it on similar brains. As soon as the ships arrive, I'll send you some samples. - All right, go ahead. - Thank you boss. - Set for generating units, sir. - What are our losses? - 18 seriously damaged. Considering large number of slaves connected. Minimum required reduplicative 50. - Oh, look Sean. Look at this. There's a new reaction. - Yes. - Come and see - Hold on a second. - Listen, it's important. Look at this, a positive reaction, see. It works at last. - Yes. It's turning into a massive molecule. It's anti-enthirium. - You're right, It's anti-enthirium. [both cheering] We got it at last! - That moon reminds me of the time when you and I used to cool like doves, the way Tilt and Tilly are doing right now. - Okay, okay, forget it. - Who gave you that? Your toy soldier? - It's none of your business. [explosives exploding] - Ah! The anti-enthirium! - It's unstable. - Another failure. - We don't have a hope. - You don't give the impression that you're really very worried about all this. Hmm? You know something, I've never stopped thinking about you in all these years, Irene. - Let's have a look at the laboratory. - All right, whatever you say. - Yes, but this down there it makes me feel a bit rusty. - That's all in your mind. - You found the correct path at least. - Sure, the only trouble is if we can't make the anti-enthirium stable, it will kill us. - Keep your chin up, Bridgette I was so happy. I thought we'd done it at last. - What was all that noise? How's a guy supposed to sleep in this joint? - I see you've been playing with fireworks again. - Without a barrier... - These flesh and blood creatures certainly go at things the hard way. - You're right. They managed to discover anti-enthirium then start shorting their circuits because they can't make the compound stable. - But any compound can be made stable. Even a pocket calculator knows that. - Why don't we try to do it? - You go ahead. I was never very well programmed in chemistry. - All right, we'll do a quick spectrographic analysis and then we just have to raise the critical temperature by adding a little pinch of this. - Are you sure it will work? - If not, we'll all go together. - Hey, those two robots, look what they're doing. - Oh my God! They're gonna kill us all! - Hit the gym! - Undercover! - Keep your head down, man. - You see less than 1% antimony and the compound has become stable. - Oh Tilt, you're so clever. I would have tried to do it but the inverse infinity ratio. - Standard with antimony! - He's found the the answer. It doesn't explode. - Tilt is an experienced... - The anti-enthirium is stable? Splendid work. Now there's a chance for us. - My compliments. - Hey, keep your hands to yourself. That was great work kids. I'm really proud of you. Terrific! - I can understand your enthusiasm. It's more than justified. And my compliments to our robot researchers too. But now we must start to prepare a plan for the destruction of the alien enemy. Before we can accomplish this, we must possess a large quantity of anti-enthirium, which Sean and Bridgette can synthesize tonight, all ready for Holly to bring out to the base. - But they'll arrest me. - They'll give you a medal, I'll bet. [upbeat music] - We can't manage to fit out more than five space fighters. That's the most our technicians will have time to prepare. - That'll be enough provided we're able to utilize the surprise factor. - Right now, you'd better get some rest. You will have to be in top form tomorrow. We'll attack as soon as the ship is fitted out. [laser-gun resonating] - Good one, we can capture him at last. [upbeat music] - What's happening? - We've got to sound the alarm wake everybody up. Wait a minute, that reminds me. Now I remember why we wanted to commit suicide. - All right, let's hear it. Not that I have much faith in your memory anymore. - Anyway, we wanted to commit suicide because we could never go to sleep. - I knew it. What a silly idea. I've never felt the slightest desire to go to sleep. It's just a waste of time. - No, it isn't. I remember that you wanted to sleep so you could dream about me and you persuaded me that we should commit suicide because if you couldn't dream about me your whole life had no meaning and I wanted to dream about you that's why... - I'm going back to the base. - The attack is set for tomorrow morning with only five ships it's a hopeless mission. - Lieutenant Carerra, the aliens have captured Professor Murray. - What? - I got sidetracked and forgot to sound the alarm, - Sound the alarm, why? What's wrong? - Tilt just said that the aliens have captured Professor Murray. - And Irene too, she was acting real funny like she was hypnotized and just trailing after them. - They'll be in that ship. Come on, let's go. - One moment everyone. What are you gonna fight them with? Your fists and your feet. Come to the laboratory and get your weapons. I've fitted your old space suits with a flexible alloy made of enthirium. - I've also made a number of swords, some of the ones the aliens use, but better. - Look at that chest. - With these, all you have to do is touch the Androids and they'll be irreparably damaged. - You've done a great job Sean. [upbeat music] Just like child athletes, when it was just a frail weakling. - What's that? - The hero's death. - I oughta challenge you to a deal for that. - Come on, make it snappy. We have to hurry. [upbeat music] - Why did you want to start out alone? We should have waited for the others. [upbeat music] - The aliens are taking the professor aboard their spaceship. We have to do something. - Yeah we do, like run away. Tilt, let's get out of here. I'm frightened. - There's nothing to be afraid of, they're not programmed to recognize us. They can't even see us. - Well, this one must have the wrong program. - So long. - No, hold on Tilly. Where are you going? Wait! Aaargh! These robot women. [upbeat music] [laser-gun resonating] - Tilt, Tilt, they got me! I think I'm dying. Tilt! [groaning] [groaning] - Tilt, I'll go and look for my uncle. You lead the entrance. Here take this. - All right, but... [gurgling] - What's happening? Are you all right? Something's happened to Tilly. I've lost psycho-contact with her whenever this occurs, all my programs zero out and I can't move anymore. - Wait, here. - I have no choice. - Uncle. - What are you waiting here for? Why don't we attack? - Calm down, we got here too late. There's no way for us to get inside the ship now, unless of course someone inside opens the hatch. - But Irene's in there. She might be in danger. - Tilly is our only hope. If we manage to reactivate her, she can put us in contact with Tilt. - Norman, you are the only one who knows how robots operate. - There's nothing to worry about. I'll put her right in a flash. - But why don't we attack right away? - Don't you understand? We have to wait. Didn't you hear? - Of course, loud and clear. - Uncle, Uncle. Wake up, uncle. - Where are we? - The aliens kidnapped you and brought you to their spaceship. We have to get out of here. Come on. - I don't know if I can make it, how did it ever happen? - I'll explain later. Come on. - You are connected to Android Captain of cargo fleet in arrival Lord Kes. - Prepare storage space. You'll probably need accommodation for over one million slaves. Let me know when you're ready to load. - We will follow your orders. - Tilt! - There, that's it. - Tilt, where are you? - Where are you, Tilt? - Let's get her back. There you go. - Good girl. - Come on everybody, quick. Irene and the professor are in here. Hurry! - Here we are Tilt, we're coming. - Sir the instruments show native activity outside the vessel. - Follow order 24B. Destroy natives. Use nuclear on the [mumbles] - Wait outside Tilly. - Hurry everyone. Inside, quick! Come on, hurry! - Something's strange here sir, the natives seem to have gone now. - Hurry, uncle. You must try hard. We have to get to the exit. Come on. - You go ahead Irene, I can't go any further. [groaning] - Uncle! [upbeat music] [female screaming in background] [female laughing in background] - I can't go on. - Uncle! - Leave me alone Irene, go on. - He's found me again. The power of his mind is awesome. [groaning with pain] - Lord Kes, several humans have succeeded in entering our vessel armed with enthirium swords. We need reinforcements. - I'll deal with it at once. - Look out, uncle. [swords clanking] [door rattling] [resonating music] - Professor, Professor Murray. Professor Murray. Professor! [resonating music] [men shouting] [swords clanking] - Morning, I've sealed off the slave compartments, sir. - Blast it. - Are you all right, professor? We must get out of here. We're in danger. They can't hold out much longer. Professor! They're pretty delicate these Androids, huh? Let's go before some more arrive. - Professor Murray, you're safe, thank goodness! But where's Irene? - They've locked her in that room there. See if you can get her out. I just can't manage it. - Poor deluded fools. I'll teach you to rebel against a new master, you will all die in atrocious agony. - I can feel that mind again. Do what you can. I have to get away. - Get him out of here, quickly! - The temperature is rising rapidly. - Quick, quick! Head for the door everyone. Or we'll all be burned alive. Retreat! - Thank goodness we're together again, Tilt! - Irene, Irene. [upbeat music] Irene, can you hear me? - Irene do you feel my mind? Yes, I can sense that you do. Now relax. Drive all thought from your mind. Concentrate. Concentrate. Because if we unite our mental energy, we may be able to open the door. The controls here operate on telepathic command. Think strongly along with me. Open - Open. - Open, open. - Open, open, open. - Open - Quick, we're getting ready to lift off. They've started the reactors. - Irene and I, will go back to the laboratory. Perhaps we can be of some use there. Come along, Tilt and Tilly, come with us. - Let's go. - Where's Norman? - Hey, get away from the ship. - I just made it, Hunter. - You sure did! [spacecraft roaring] - Look at her go. She's huge, gigantic. Quick, we gotta go after her in the fighters. To the base. - Commander, commander. Our hyper radar is signaling the approach of a fleet of alien vessels. The computer has analyzed their course and they are heading for a rendezvous with a flying saucer. - Did you hear that Flanagan? There are more aliens. Let's get the first bunch now we'll get rid of them before their friends come and help. - Halt! - I'm Lieutenant Carrera. I order you to let us pass. My men and I have to launch a fighter attack at once on the alien vessel. - And I order you to follow me. You're under arrest. - Arrest? Not before I speak with commander Barr. - Impossible. At the moment, Commander Barr is on a mission. [punches thudding] - Quick, we haven't got a second to lose. [spacecrafts roaring] - I have 16 cargo vessels with me. There are native fighters on our screen, so I'm awaiting your instructions. - Get ready to attack, there are just two, and they can't be dangerous. The planet isn't able to, they are only barbarians. They have no weapons against enthirium. Destroy them. [rocket engine roaring] - Flanagan, the anti-enthirium doesn't help us at all. They're traveling at such a high velocity that our shots don't even reach them. - What do you think we should do now, commander? I suggest we return to the station. - I'll try one more attack. If it fails, we'll go back to base. Matrix for attack outline, 1820, attack potential, two. Very good sir. - Follow it. - Look out Commander, you've got one on your tail. - Destroy it! - Yes sir. [aircrafts exploding loudly] - I've been hit! [upbeat music] - Flanagan and Barr have been hit. Now it's up to us and it'll be tough. - Let me go ahead, Dirk, I want to avenge my commander. - I really wouldn't. Okay, go ahead. - It's suicide Dirk. We'll never manage to do it. Their velocity is superior to ours. - They're going into battle. - We must do something to help them or they don't have a chance. - Of course there's one way I might help out. All of the aliens are concentrated in sector M. If I could get my concentration back again, I think I could manage to interfere with their power drives, and slow down their propulsor engines. Putting our fleet on an equal footing with the aliens but only for a minute. [tense music] - There they are, straight ahead. - Attention please, this is base calling. You can get it the enemy now. Professor Murray is slowing down their drive system with telepathy. [aircrafts exploding loudly] - Sean, Bridgette there's another formation of aliens on your tail. - Holly, there are two more beside you. - I got their range. I'm right on top of them. They're all mine. - Look out, you're going too far. - You missed him! Look out, he's gonna get you. [groaning in pain] - There's another closing in on you, Sean. - Where is he? I can't look at him, Bridgette - Don't you worry, I'll take care of it. I got him Sean, you see that? Buckle on everyone, there are more coming. - Watch out, you don't eat the crap with the prisoners. We'll have to try to force it to land. Holly, be careful. There's one after you. - I'll force you to land you bastards. [beeping] - We must retreat sir, we only have two craft left. - Sacrifice them. Crash dive into those native fighters. Yes, Lord Kes. - Look out Holly, there are two of them homing in on you. - I've been hit. This is Holly. Holly here. I've been hit. They're following me. - Hold tight Holly. I'm on my way. - Even in the great days of Hollywood, no movies star ever died, so heroically. [aircraft exploding loudly] - Sean, Bridget they are all yours. - Okay Dirk, we'll follow them. - Sean, they are outdistancing us. We have to increase velocity. - Sean, Bridget, I've eliminated the remaining saucers here, but I don't see you on the radar. Where are you? - We're right on his tail Dirk. We won't give up as he goes to the end of the universe. [large explosion] [soothing piano music] - You survived. - Yeah. - You're alive. - Yeah. - Listen, I... - Uh-ah! Don't try it. - What? - Your eyes. I learned everything about that from my uncle. - Oh Irene, I couldn't hypnotize you. Honest. - You already have. [soothing piano music] Uh-ah! - Tilly, I finally remembered why we wanted to commit suicide. - Really Tilt? - Yes, because you could never prove your love by going all the way with me. - That's right, now I remember too. But what do we do now? Commit suicide again? - But there's no need. I can make some little design changes, adjust a few details, and you can prove your love like any other people. Simple. - Lord Kess of Koba is offering Soul Three today. I hardly need say, that this is a remarkable opportunity. A planet teaming with every sort of life, animal life, plant life, and human life. Slaves of every color, 10 billion slaves, all strong and healthy like these two samples Kess of Koba has brought us along with him. - 100 million credits. - 200 million. - My Lords, this planet is unique. Therefore, the starting price is 300 million credits. It's worth more than that. Over 10 billion human slaves just waiting until they're captured. - 600 million credits. - 600 million credits. Lord Gad of Tokol has made a generous offer. - Very generous offer. I concede ownership of Soul Three. I hope you enjoy it. You get 50% [voiceover] But what can you do with all that money? - The agreement was 50% , plus the prisoners. As for all that money. - I think I'd like to get a nice little planet of our own. - Ladies and gentlemen the... [smooth flute music]
