Sorry, honey. I forgot. That's okay. Can I have a therapist? Honey, you know we've talked about this. Just because all the other kids are in therapy does not mean you need to be. I know, but I... I think... you are just as well-adjusted... as anyone else your age. Maybe more so. Unless there's something you haven't told me. I mean, is there? No. Are you sure? Yeah. I mean... you just don't understand how hard it is to be a senior these days, Mom. So you think I should pull a Frida Kahlo over the fact that he didn't call me? Maybe he felt too vulnerable. What the... Can you believe this? How bad are my circles? Very Kate Moss during heroin chic. My mother kept me up all night last night obsessing over whether she should marry Irving now that he asked her to sign a prenup. What did you advise? I told her to hold out for more. Marrying money is the only thing she does well. Why should she sell herself short? Curiously strong mint? So now that you and Chad have hooked up, do you think you're going out or just having sex? I don't know. I guess I should ask him. What about you and Louie, or you and Petrus? Are you... going out or just having sex? We're definitely going out. We're going way out. Are you sure Petrus isn't a fag? Yes, I'm sure. He's just European. Oh, crap, you guys. We should go. I respect your opinion, sir, and I just can't fathom why you would give me such a low grade. An A-minus? Well, yeah. It totally brings down my average, and I fully intend on getting into Yale, sir. Hey, Nell. Yeah, whatever. "Yeah, whatever"? Nell, every guy in this school is hot for you. Hey. Darling. And Petrus here is missing a chromosome. Why are you such a freak? I'm not into beefcake. Time management, girls. Time management. All right, let's wipe our minds clear of fantasy, if that's possible, and get down to reality. Jennifer Simon, what did you do to get into college today? Well, I explored cross-culture communication with my maid, Maria Josefa. Hmm. Good try, but, uh, a bit transparent. College admission committees are trained to sniff out bullshit. Not that we couldn't blow smoke in that direction, that's what I'm here for, but we have to start with the basis of reality. Anyone else? Yeah, uh... well, Senator Dimatto had dinner at my parents' house last night, and, uh, I got him to write me a recommendation. Ah. Now that's more like it. Now, that's using your assets. You mean your father's assets, right? Yeah? Hmm? Uh, what about you, Mr. Rockefeller? Rockefeller? Do you plan to take the SATs again? I've told you. I don't use the name Rockefeller. I go by Lipschitz. Well, Henry D. Rockefeller is a legacy. Uh, Henry Lipschitz is, uh, not. So I hope when the time comes, there'll be no confusion what name you put on your application. He changed his name freshman year. So Emilio Estevez. All right. Now let's begin by reading the introduction to my book, warm off the press, and I think it's an easy read and very easy to understand, I assure you. And please take note of the title: Getting In. Shall we begin? Stream Hodsell. "In my 15 years of experience "as a college counselor "in the finest prep schools on the East Coast, "I am increasingly amazed at the level of competition "to get into good colleges and universities. "For every one spot, there are 100 qualified applicants, "and yet last year I got 40% of my seniors "into Harvard, Yale, or Princeton, "and 70% into the Ivy League. How do I do it? Marketing." Hey, gorgeous. Hi. Why don't you meet me in the equipment closet in a couple of minutes? But I have calculus. I know. Why? I know, but, uh... I really need to talk to you. Yeah... Ohh...

I thought you were in a total state of bliss. Well, it's novel. But I think I like third base better. Well, I mean, sure, third base is great. I mean, really doing it takes a while to get used to. But then you'll love it. Really? You guys love it? Yeah. It's sex. Jennifer, darling. I couldn't help but overhear. The intercom was on. Mother, privacy, please. You're not respecting my boundaries. Oh, darling, I think it's just adorable that you're exploring your sexuality. Really, I just love it. Could you not be so fucking patronizing? Well, there's nothing to be ashamed of, Jennifer. Plenty of women don't enjoy sex, and I'll tell you why right now. Because they're not climaxing. They've never experienced the deepest female pleasure. We don't need your insight, Dr. Ruth. I had countless lovers who thought that female orgasm was some sort of Chinese paper folding. Ha ha ha ha ha! I mean, utterly without a clue. What do you mean? Look, it's the '90s, okay? There's an article in Cosmo, like, every month about female orgasm, so... Cosmo. How do you expect to learn anything from those bony girls with breast implants? Okay, out. Out, out, out, out.

Maintenant en français. Maintenant, parlez. Parlez en français. Allez-y. Allez-y. Est-que vous avais jamais voyager en France? Listen, Jen, I think your mom's right. I'm not orgasming. What? No. How can you have sex without orgasming? I don't think this is appropriate conversation. Non, non, non! En français! We must be with the French. Je veux l'orgasme. That means I want an orgasm. No shit. Oh, là là! Qu'est-ce que c'est, ça? Maintenant... Stream. Oui, Renée, je suis allé en France. Très bien. Maintenant... Nell? Moi aussi. J'ai visité la France, et je l'ai beaucoup aimée. Bon. Jenny. Oui. Uh... Oui. Foie gras. Non. Non. Pas bien. Pas bien. I don't know why I do so badly in this class. I have a real connection with the French. I mean, come on. All my favorite shirts are from Agnes B. How can you be sure you do? Stream, we've been having sex a lot longer than you have. We've been doing it since we were 15. When you were going on hayrides in Vermont, we were busy getting laid. You mean every time you guys have sex, you experience "increased heat and tingliness "that leads to a feeling of inevitability, "and then a dam-breaking burst "of piercing pleasure and muscle spasms, followed by trembling and diminishing shudders"? That about sums it up. More or less. I guess it's just me, then. Don't feel inadequate. You just need to loosen up. Right. Well, according to the experts, I should increase my relationships for my sensuality, develop my fantasy life, and more fully communicate my needs to my partner. Don't be too bossy and make your partner lose his erection. Mmm. Dick, I know I'm just a shareholder now, but I love this company, and you're running it into the ground. You got to be kidding if you think people are gonna buy avocado-flavored toothpaste. No. Yeah. I know we're all-natural, but this is disgusting. No, I'm not wigging out. I'm trying to communicate with you from a very centered place, and save us all from financial ruin. Oh, really? Well, you can just kiss my ass if that's what I get for trying to help. He hung up. Can you believe that? Well, you did tell him to kiss your ass. Yeah. As if no one ever told him that before. Well, you're the one who's so committed to communication. Why don't you try to be more diplomatic? We don't negotiate with terrorists. All right. I have rage. Sorry. I have rage. Mom, you seem stressed out. Maybe we should take a vacation, go to Vermont for the weekend. I can't be in the same state as your father. I'm sorry. No. Vermont is a nest of bad memories. Look at you. You look so pretty. Are you going out with that boy whose father made all those Mafia movies? Yeah, Chad. Chad. Who's your date with? A most cultured and sophisticated man. A potter from South Africa. For an amateur, your mother has a very good eye. She was immediately drawn to my work. Bartholomew's quite a successful artist. I saw his show at MOMA, and I just immediately... I felt, I don't know. You just have so much to teach me. Oh, thank you. But you want to be a photographer. Well, of course, Stream. That's what's so fascinating about it. Yes. Very few people understand how difficult it is to express human suffering in ceramics. That is true. Very, very true. Really, that's so true. Extremely true. Absolutely. Absolutely. Really true. Yeah. So, honey, what do you and Chad have planned for tonight? I'm not sure. We might be going for drinks with his dad and Barbra Streisand. Barbra Streisand. Ooh! I wonder if she might sing a song. You never know. Chad? ♪ Walkin' is a way out ♪ Drivin' is a way out ♪ Flyin' is a way out... Okay. Right, then. What must we never ever forget? The people who write the SATs are not as smart as I am. Correct. Instead of panicking, choose B or D. Yes. And remember, it's almost never E. Exactly. Thanks, man. Thank me after you get your scores. Hey, baby. Is that the thousand-dollar- an-hour guy? Afshin. Yeah. He's fucking worth it, though. My brother's scores went up 200 points last year. I wish I could get my parents to pay for him. I'm taking them again, too. Why? You got a 1450. Yeah. My dad wants me to break 1500. He's got this fantasy that somehow I'll get a scholarship if I can hit some magical percentile. Whoa. Cruel world. Well, I do want to get into the best school I can, so I might as well try, right? Nell's parents are making her take them again, and she got a... 1510, right? They'll have her committed if she doesn't get into Yale. That's so sick. You want wine? Sure. Barbra had to cancel. My dad went to a screening, so, uh, we have all night to, uh... hang out. Great. You know... I've been thinking a lot about myself as a woman. So have I. Oh. Thanks. Well, anyway, I feel like, um... it'd be good... I'd... I'd like to communicate... Us to communicate. Sure. Sure. What is it? It's sort of about sex. Hold on a sec. That's Dial-a-Weed. I called before you came. Dial-a-Weed? So what was that you were saying about sex? Well... it's no big deal or anything.

How's that? Very good. How's your kidney feel? Oh, much better. You know, an artist must never descend to the petty brouhaha of real life. When did you divorce? Two years ago. Mmm. I came to New York to live with Stream, and he stayed up in Vermont with his pin-headed new girlfriend. Mmm. Of course, we're still great friends. That's good. That's very mature. Mm. Oh... Ohh! I'm sorry I took so long. Oh, that's okay. You know, I have this friend Stream. Oh, my heart goes out to her. She's so sexually unfulfilled. She just can't climax. It's awful. I do the best I can to give her advice, but... I don't know. Sometimes I feel like... some people are innately sensual, and some just aren't, you know? Does your friend masturbate? Masturbate? Well, no. She's not desperate or anything. I mean, she does have a boyfriend. Each section is timed at 30 minutes. We will give you a five-minute warning before each section is finished.

Place your answer sheets inside your test booklets and pass them to the end of the table for a proctor to collect. Do not leave your seat until a proctor has collected your test booklet.

It's all about being relaxed. We were definitely relaxed. We did X. Oh. Yeah, well, drugs always help, I guess. I'm doing it. I will allow my parents to live vicariously through me. I'm applying for early admissions to Yale. Ah. Very nice, very nice. Harvard. Early. Ah. Me, too. Early to Brown. Oh. Is it against the rules to have my stepfather's secretary type up my application form? Uh, Jennifer, I don't think your grades or your scores on your SATs, which you chose not to retake, will get you in early to Brown. It's okay. My father bought me a learning disability. What the hell is that? It's an official statement from a highly regarded education specialist that says my low SAT scores and my mediocre grades are in no way a reflection of my intelligence.

Oh, well, I hope you're happy with Sarah Lawrence. Yeah, I hear they have a great finger-painting department. I don't have to remind you, I hope, that your early applications are due November 15, which means those of you who get them in early will have a month to brush up on your weak areas. Uh, Stream, what about, uh, what about your extracurricular activities, hmm? Uh, well, um... How you doing? Can I get a hot soup? Hey. So why did you change your name? I have a prison record. You do? No. I'm kidding. I made it up. Oh. Actually, it's my mom's name. I didn't want to ride my dad's luxury train the rest of my life. Barely know the guy. Oh. I see. I'll take a doughnut. Do you want a doughnut? No, thanks. One doughnut. Listen, uh... do you want to go hear some music sometime? Uh, I don't think I should. I'm kind of seeing Chad. Why? What? Why would you want to go out with that guy? Well... I like him. Do you? Yeah. Really? I do. But maybe all three of us could go hear some music sometime. Only if you promise he won't name-drop once all night. I can't promise that. See? One coffee, black. Here you go. Where's your drink? I don't like to waste calories on beverages, but I'll have a sip of yours. It is so great to finally be orgasmic. Does it show? Well, where exactly should I be looking? At my face, bitch. Ooh, "bitch." So urbane. Well, you certainly look self-satisfied, if that's what you mean. So when you were trying to have an orgasm, did you ever masturbate? Masturbate? Not really. I didn't think so. I mean, it's so weird. Every time I try, I just get bored and fall asleep. Yeah. It's just not my style. I think it's mostly for people who never get out. Mmm. Life is so unfair. Oh, how can you stand to be in the same Jacuzzi as my cellulite? You are so nuts. Hello. Who is it? Yes, this is she. Look, I'm not interested. I just went on a cruise last summer. Mine went to Europe. No, I'm not interested. I'm in the middle of a Jacuzzi. I am not interested. I am gonna hang up on you. I'm not interested. Do you get paid to be this obnoxious? Oh, my God. What the hell happened to you? Guess what. I was wrong. Hi, baby. Look, Chad, did you really think I had an orgasm in your limo, or were you just ready to come? What the fuck kind of question is that? Well, I didn't, and I think it's very manipulative of you to tell me I did. Yeah? Well, fuck you. Come on, Nell. Don't you think it's a little weird that Stream needed aquatherapy to have her breakthrough? I mean, I go off like a rocket the second Louie caresses me. Ahem. Excuse me. Oh! Listen, Jen, I think maybe we should stop seeing each other. What? Why? We're not connecting in bed. It's like... You know what I mean? Our sex life's empty. Empty? So then I told him it was over. I felt stifled. Watch it! Hey! Anyway, so we were just sitting there, and... Stream, are you even listening to me? Yeah. I'm stunned. I thought you were in love with Louie. Well, I wasn't. Could you please stop staring at Mr. Fashion Nightmare over there? I think he's funny. I think he smells. I've got a confession to make. What? Okay, ladies, come on, chop-chop. Move it. Sitting on your rumps and yapping ain't playing volleyball. Urinary tract infections, Mr. Neipris. Urinary tract infection? Sorry. So what's the confession? I got to face reality. I don't like sex, either. What? Oh, God, don't tell me you're not climaxing, too. It's just the sad truth. Wow, Jen. You're the only one of us who's gotten off with a guy. Well... I've been having doubts, too. I mean, to be honest, sex with Louie was kind of a drag. Now that I think about it, I think I spent most of coitus figuring out what color I wanted for my next manicure. Oh, my God. Prozac? Wait. If none of us has ever had it with a guy, then who has?

So I'm assigning an essay to be handed in on Friday. In five to ten pages, present a careful exegesis of the structure of the play with an emphasis on the dramatic tensions that lead to the climax. Another essay before Friday? Doesn't she realize we've got our own tensions leading to climax? Channel it. All right. Now you can use the rest of the class to prepare your positions. What's this?

I'm sure he has a lot of knowledge about female pleasure. Great. How old is he? 40-ish, but very well-preserved. Trust me, he's really attractive. Giddyup. Okay. Look, Dad, I'm really sorry I didn't break 1500 on my SATs, but I'm not sure getting a scholarship was a realistic goal. I mean, I'll be lucky if I even get into one of those schools. What are you talking about? You're a genius. I'm not. I'm just a good student at a good high school. I mean, I'm probably not even eligible to get in. They look at what your parents make...

Count me out of the older men idea. Girls who go out with older men are freaks. No, they're not. They're sophisticated. Well, this chick Mimi has obvious emotional problems, and the whole thing made my dad look like a letch. Did you say Daddy's a letch? Hold on. Not really. Sort of. Boy, I think so, too. Where'd you get this? It's so cute. Stream... Anyway, I just can't cope with the whole Doug the Sponsor strategy. It's just too gross. So how bald is your father? On a scale of 1 to 10? Did he say anything about me? Is your mom yakking about your dad again? Okay, don't tell me. I don't want to put you in the middle. Tell your mother to get of there. I hope you told him I'm seeing a South African potter. Mom, please, I'm on the phone. You're always on the phone. I never get to see you anymore. What about our relationship? My mother's driving me crazy. So what... What... What did your father give you for Christmas? Well, no kidding! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! How old does he think you are? 10? Anyway, go ahead. It's 11:30. Clearly, we've made a tactical error. I mean, none of the cool people have arrived. If I have to face the new year with no prospects for a climax, I'm gonna go post naked pictures of myself on the damn Internet. Nell, didn't any of your new male model friends invite you to a New Year's Eve party? What new male model friends? Yeah, Nell. Where are Kate and Naomi going? Look, let's just go to Betsy Bradley's. I mean, at least her stepfather owns the Knicks. I'm gonna go get a drink. A low-tech party, huh? Yeah. How'd you end up here? Uh, the guy's the bass player in my band. What band? Oedipus Wreck. Oh, I guess I got to go. Why don't you stick around? Rebel against the committee for once. They're not a committee. They don't tell me what to do. They're my friends. Then let's go for a walk. How do you know I want to? Well, I'm asking. Do you? Fine. Fine. What the hell's she doing? What? Where are you going? Great. So... what's your first choice? Wouldn't it be great for once to spend an evening with someone and not talk about college? Is that possible? I mean, they make it seem like the college you get into determines the quality of the rest of your life. Well, it sort of does, doesn't it? No, not unless you see your life like a line on a grid. You can't plan out the future anyway. The future's a... figment of your imagination. Whatever happened to chaos? Rolling in the mud, for fuck's sake. I'd like to roll in the mud. Now, that is a fine idea. Come on. W-What are you doing? Wait. Where are you going? Raagh! Come on! But what about my outfit? Your outfit is just an illusion. You see, the mud, that's real. Aah! Oh, God. Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Oh, God! Ha ha ha ha! Do you want to kiss me? Do you want to kiss me? I don't know. I thought you might want to kiss me. Well, that wasn't what I was thinking about right then. Why the hell not? It's the new year. Don't you want to kiss somebody for good luck? I don't believe in the traditional shit. Do you want to always do what everyone else does? No. I don't, as a matter of fact. I went on this walk with you, didn't I? I mean, I have a lot going on inside me that you don't know about. Just because I happen to have two very close friends doesn't mean I can't think for myself. Ohh... Well, babe, that's what you get for ditching your girlfriends to go roll around in the mud with some self-hating blueblood. I guess you're right. He wouldn't even come on to me. That guy's a waste of your time. Stream! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what! Harvard! Ha ha ha ha! What does it say? What does it say? Yes? It's only a deferral. I've spoken with the people at admissions at Harvard, and they assure me there's a chance she'll be accepted in April, so she's still in the running. But you saw her application. Wasn't it really special? Yes, but now she has an opportunity to try other schools. Is Stream terribly disappointed? Well, she claims to be fine, but, you know, how could she not feel like a terrible failure? Not that I think that. Well, of course not. But, you know, it wouldn't hurt to have a talk with her just to make sure that she realizes you're all right with this. Mom, don't be so bummed out. Even if I don't get in anywhere, it doesn't determine the quality of the rest of my life. Oh, I know. It's just that you're so much better than all those other kids. I don't see how Nell got in early when you didn't. Of course, I don't think you should be competitive. Well, Jenny didn't get in early, either. Well, Jenny's father can always donate a library to Brown, and trust me, she'll get in, whereas your father... We'll be lucky if he buys you some sweaters from L.L. Bean. Maybe... Maybe I just wasn't focused enough. Maybe I... Whew... Maybe I should have got you more help, more support. Maybe I should have done your homework for you. I... But you know? I'm really fine about the whole thing. And I... I feel totally confident about the way I brought you up. I do. It's no accident that I sent you to a Montessori kindergarten. You're a very bright young girl with a strong sense of independence. Condoms? Oh, my God. I need to sit down. Oh... I'm... I'm struggling. Believe me, I'm struggling. I hate sounding like a conservative, but I think it might be... normal for... for... For a loving parent to have this reaction. You're too young! You're just a kid! I'm sorry, but I feel... I feel 100% judgmental. Ow. You're right. I hate myself for sounding judgmental. I guess I just have to accept the fact that you're... almost an adult, and y-you have to take responsibility for your own decisions. So why are you here? My mother flipped her lid when she found some condoms. I'm investigating sex. Isn't that normal? Who can say what's normal? I mean, 70% of American teenagers do it. What's wrong with girls wanting to have sex as much as guys do? I mean, I'm not... obsessed with sex. Well, that's good. But... I wish I knew how to get a guy to make me climax. Like, how does that happen? How do you think it happens? It seems like you... I don't know. Is the guy supposed to... You tell him your needs, and he does stuff to you. Is it, uh, possible that Stream is being a little bit passive? Passive? Stream? Where's Nell? I thought she was coming over. Like she needs to post a personal ad. Need I say more? She's in the land of hot young things. I can't even get her on the phone anymore. Never mind. Let's read yours. Okay. "Young, sexy single white female "actively seeks sensitive lover "for active mutual exploration. Over 21 need not respond." Yawn. Where are you gonna post that, the Village Voice? Yeah, actually. Well, they have the best response rate. What were you thinking? I don't know. Doesn't Town & Country have a web site? Town & Country? Jenny, you wrote... "I like to scream and prance. "Will you poke me with your lance? "To hell with lame romance. I want to cream my pants." Perfect. I love it. I don't know, Jen. The shrink said to be active, not obscene. Scream, cream? What could be more active? All right, we cannot sit at the same table. Yeah, but I want to see your guy. Okay, you can sit there. Is that a baseball cap? Is that a head of tangled hair? Hi. So, uh... So where do you study film? NYU. Oh, great. So what are your films about? Oh, you know, "The prostitute turns out to be my mother" type of thing. Whoa. So you ready for a little... mutual exploration, huh? Sure. Cool. All right. Let's get out of here. Excuse me. Meatman 703? You know, hung like a horse, born to ride? Uh... no. No. Hi.

I mean, skinny enough to be attractive? You look too skinny to me, ma'am. Thank you. ♪ I wanna be Mr. Rodeo Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! You know, your message didn't say anything about role-playing.

I don't even want to know. Where have you been, Stream? Maybe if you had a clue, I might confide in you every now and then. What the hell does that mean? You're so obsessed with being in touch with me, but you're not even in touch with yourself. I am so in touch. I'm in touch with both... Both you and myself. I'm totally in touch. No, you're not. I mean, what's up with your so-called photography career anyway? Is that just a way to convince yourself you have a life beyond Dad? That is so mean. I can't believe you said that. Bartholomew has a highly celebrated aesthetic, and he's totally supportive of my work. What work? You mean these snapshots you took of me when we were in Jamaica? You're grounded! That's right!

Matisse's feelings for Loulou are perfectly representing his pure, naked emotion. It's as if she's floating in a yellow sea, her large breasts undulating in golden waves. And then, on the right, we have the angry S-S-Soulio, who reminds me... Good night. I'm going to sleep now. Good night. Look at her heart, which is like an angry, meat-like globe.

Anyway, shouldn't we take her to the hospital or whatever? No, my parents are gonna be home any minute. They'll kill me. I thought that was the point. Jen, can you be sensitive? My life is fucking hell. What happened? I thought everything was going really well for you. Like when? Like when you were on the cover of YM. You said you got free drinks at every club. Nell, you're, like, so beautiful and so smart and... and blasé. Everyone wants to be like you. Nobody really knows me. Oh, Nelly. How many Prozacs did you take? I don't know. Three. Three?

Of course, I'm aware that you snuck out last night. But I want you to know that I, uh, spent the whole night meditating on it, and I, uh, I understand that you... You're probably upset about your father's so-called financial crisis. So I've decided to move beyond grounding as a means of discipline. I still feel that you have not behaved responsibly, but I... I can only advise you and hope that you respect my opinion. Thanks. You're welcome. And now, for a special treat, we're taking you into the sweaty world of high school rock 'n' roll.

The drummer? You mean from Brearley? You mean she's not sleeping with Henry? Nope. The dyke? Fantastic! Her name is Liza, and you know what, Stream? You were right. Like has everything to do with sexual ecstasy. I knew it. At least it's totally trendy, right? I mean... you never know. You could get your own sitcom. Shut up, Jen. I think it's great, Nell. Congratulations. Thanks. Hey, Stream, come check this out. Papaya gingko energizing cream with oatmeal. How does it feel? Huh? It's tingly. Energizing. It's great. It is, right? God, I'm gifted with herbs. You know, honey, now that I've finally freed Judy from Dick and Judy's, I realize how frustrated I've been. It's really blocking my spiritual progress. I'm a born businesswoman. Who was I trying to kid with that photography idea? A lot of your photos are really good. Thanks, but, you know, I have to consider it, like, a hobby. I mean, the minute I start thinking about it as a professional thing, I get so... I get so, um, claustrophobic. I can't go near a darkroom. Mom, you are so self-actualized. Well, it's about time. You know, I've been so overwhelmed with my own stuff, I haven't really... really understood what you were going through as a young woman, and, you know, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. And now... Harvard. Harvard Schmarvard. This time, I'm not even gonna watch. You know I love you, no matter what. I can't believe it! I just can't believe I have to go to Vassar! It's a nightmare! You're gonna love it. It's really low-pressure there. Poughkeepsie's a really good town. Oh, come on! Thank you, Daddy. Brown. It was really touch and go for a while, but he finally found the right person to bribe. Stream, you? Yes, I got in, and my mom finally released her inner-entrepreneur, so now she's sure she can help me pay for it. That's so good. That's really nice. You know, he got into Harvard and Yale. So he'll either be in my class or yours, Nell. Oh, not mine. I'm not going. What? You've got to be kidding. After all that work? Oh, God, Nell, your poor parents. They're gonna commit hari-kari. I'm not doing anything that feels wrong anymore. Maybe I'll join the Peace Corps and go to school afterwards. Or maybe I won't. It's my life. Peace Corps. Hmm. That's awesome, Nell. Thanks. Go get him. Congratulations, Henry Lipschitz. Thanks. Uh, congratulations to you, Stream Hodsell. Will you go out with me? I thought I wasn't your type. You are. I... I just haven't been listening to myself. I understand if you don't want to. I was really, um... I just wanted you to know that I think about you sometimes, and I'm sorry if I acted like a jerk. I'll go out with you. You will? You want some time to think about it? No. I don't need time to think about it. I mean, is commitment a bad thing, you know? So how come you never kissed me that night in the park? I was nervous. Really? But you're a rocker. Well, I don't... I don't kiss people I barely know. Oh. Well, that's a good policy. Listen. I've got some things I want to show you, okay? Okay. I've got some things to show you, too. Me first. Mmm... Ohh... Ahh...
