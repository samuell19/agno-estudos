Here are the poplars, the body must be near. Do you see anything? Yes boss, it's there! Is he dead? No, he sings. -What? He sings? That takes the cake! We'll make him dance, you'll see! What a mess! Watch out for holes. Thanks I just figured that out on my own. It's here again. So my boy, taking a trip to the country? So pretty... What brought you here? -I don't know what brought you here, but I know that I'm a moron. -You and me, that's two then. Put your hands in the air, and no funny business. Else I swear you'll regret it. Wait, look boss. Of course. Always the same stuff. Good night chief, I know the author of the parrot swindle committed against the American millionaire. The loot is in the fireplace. And of course don't thank me. Sorry. -Don't apologize, I'm used to it. Please don't restrain yourself, I don't mind. You don't know how glad I am. Well let's talk about those damn parrots. Splendid birds, I own 5 of them, t only 2 talk, the other are tight as a clam. And those others that don't speak, where are they? The others... well, I'll tell you everything. In truth, they aren't parrots. -We guessed. The others are blackbirds that I painted. Yes, you painted them and passed off as real. Yes sir. -Well, time for business. Let's talk about the girl. Where did you meet her? Why did I have to meet her? She said she was American, a millionaire. And she wanted to buy a couple of parrots. And she fooled me. A drink this way, a drink that way. A dinner elsewhere... And how did she bring you there? Well, first she wanted us to go to the movies. We took a cab. After that I don't remember, I blacked out. I see. And what does she look like? How she looks? Breathtaking! A terrific pinup! Next to her, the Mona Lisa is... We got the idea. Let's go back to our business. Was she of an average height? -No, tall. -Thin probably. The complete opposite, I don't deal with bag of bones. Fat then? Flesh just where it's needed. -Black eyes? -No, blue. -Brunette? Blonde. I think that you should stop talking. You're not describing her, but Elizabeth Taylor! Exactly. She's Elizabeth Taylor, and you’re Gary Cooper. No sir. -Get on your horse and go home. And don't think about leaving town! Else I'll be the one coming to pick you up. Does that mean that I can leave. -Sure looks like. Thanks a lot -Go! Thanks! And I don't want to see you again! Of all the descriptions of this girl that we have not one looks like the other! Is she tall? Short? Fat? Thin? I'm going insane! Why is she helping us? And how does she know so much? Let her go to hell! And it starts every time with a phone call. A strange voice : "chief, chief, chief" Go now to that place. And each time there's a scoundrel with handcuffs around their wrists. With an explicative note addressed to me! And each time this note is here, and always the same. Is this is a bored millionaire playing Sherlock Holmes? Or a private detective getting paid a fortune? Or an admirer chief! Admirer? My dear lad I'd rather think that she hates me. She gets me out of bed in the middle of the night, climb hundreds of steps in houses without lifts, and through the whole city! Makes me paddle in puddles,... But she tries to help, and without her help... That's true. Without her help, I don't know what I'd do. In that case why torment yourself? If you meet her, offer her a golden medal! And gold make things better. That's true as well. But what I don't understand is how you can use the services of a detective in skirts unknown, without name or address. Hurry up lazy, time to wake up! What time is it? Midday soon. -Is it early or late? It's late for you. I believe you're invited in an hour. Yes, but that's not an important meeting. Oh, yes! Yes it is! I can't be late! He's so handsome, I can't live without him! That'll be 6 years and a day that I haven't seen him. Who is it? -He deals with black market. I can't resist guys who works at black markets. Khrushchev meet Kennedy, Kennedy meets Khrushchev, soccer, soccer, soccer,... More soccer, it goes on... Soccer... their feet must hurt. Classifieds and offers: Looking for a cook, sell soccer ball, I'm a buyer for beauty products, especially lipstick, phone... Lola, Lola! -Are you nuts? Read this! Oh my, I thought the Martians were coming. Idiot, that's a new case for red lips! Are you the one looking for beauty products? Yes, especially for lips. Red color? -Yes, very red. And how did you decide to contact me? Friend's advices. -Who's he? Mr. Groinvit, you worked for him. Ok, go on. -My name is Kalman. I was in the news when one of my diamonds were stolen. I remember that. -I want you to help me! I need the uttermost discretion. Don't tell anyone that you called me. We need to see each other! Let's meet tonight at 2AM near the obelisk. It's right at the end of Beaupertuis St, it's easy to find. That's where we'll meet. If we work for you, we're used to getting paid in advance, and that's 10,000 francs. Bills, we accept dollars as well. -Ok. Don't worry, I'll bring the money. See you later Mr. Kalman. -Yes. A good deal! -How do you know? I asked for 10,000 bucks and he said 'ok'! And paid in advance! Get in. Thanks. Should you drive so fast? Are you scared Mr. Kalman? Not at all. I'm just a bit nervous. Do you have the money? Yes, sorry. Your dollars. What do you want from me? Do you know the story of the diamond? -No, not very well. It's the main piece of my collection and its value is priceless. It was stolen 6 months ago in Prague In this town? -In Monaco. How do you know? -Someone implied it. To you? Yes, it's known that I'd give anything for it. The man who owns it is Radek. And he's supposed to come here tomorrow at 4PM through an Air France plane. Radek contacted me by phone. We'll meet in Monaco, because no one know us there. And what's my role in all that? Radek will only stay a few hours in Monaco. I want that during that small time you get my diamond back. Well, that'll cost you a lot of money! Doesn't matter. That'll always be far less than what Radek would ask. He's a vile and despicable being. Without qualms, looked for by the police of several countries. If you manage to get the stone back and to get Radek caught, you'll make a double deal! Of course, but you do realise that it's a very difficult deal. Yes, I expected that remark. But you have some advantages. The first is that you're totally unknown to Radek and that you're discreet and skillful and unable to do an irregularity. The second is that you're a woman. Do you think it's an advantage? In Radek's case, yes. He loses his mind when he sees a skirt. You'll dupe him easily. I accept. If I get the diamond back, you'll have to pay me 10,000 dollars. You'll get it. In that case: Tomorrow, if he calls don't answer the phone! Apart from that, continue as normal go to the cinema, etc. Meet me at the same place and time. And with luck, you'll get your diamond back. I hope that you'll be less rash in this case than at the wheel of your car. Don't worry. -Thanks in advance. And good luck. I'm always lucky. So, what's Radek like? You'll recognize him easily. He's 50 years old, very elegant, always wear dark suits of British cut, his face is full of wrinkles and of marks left by the smallpox. No chance of mistake. You'll recognize him as soon as he gets out of the plane. Good night. Warning, warning: The Air France plane, from Tangiers just landed. Radek, hurry up! I'm coming. Come on, that way. Nice trip? -Yes, thanks. See you later. Bye. The passengers for Marseille, Lyon & Paris are asked to present themselves at gate number five. Hey, you! Gas? -Not bread. 30L ? -Well, ok. Hi miss. Hello. -Gas? No. -Oil? No. Air? Water? Brake fluid? No! -So what do you want? To be left alone! It's not forbidden to stay here! Not by me, you can stay here for the rest of your life! How much do I owe you? -That'll be 30 francs. Here, and don't keep the change. What's the matter? Nothing, don't think you're that extraordinary. What do you want? 1kg of sugar and 1kg of salt and ring ring. Excuse me? -Can I use the phone? Yes, it's here. Yes? Lola? Listen, go take the service entrance on highway 17 I'm following an old fart who just arrived from Tangier. Where did you find your old fogey? You'll have to wait to get more details! I'm asphyxiating myself in the phone booth of a grocery, so later! Here's the sugar and the salt. I don't want it, they're not mixed. Mix salt and sugar? Yes, so it's not too sugary or salty. I just needed that, a fine! Give me the dice and a vermouth. A vermouth and the dice. Gas? No. -Oil? No. Well, I won't insist if you don't want anything. Got some fire amigo? It's forbidden to smoke. Nice lighter. -Yep. Taxi! In future, I'd be very grateful if you didn't use crude language. Good evening sir. -Good evening. Which floor sir? -Flat n°402. Fourth floor, let's go sir. Do you earn a lot of money here? It's rather hard. Most foreigners. English people mostly. And they're all so stingy! Fourth, sir. Here kid, I'm not English. Thanks, the 402 is on your right, right at the end of the hall. Oh, it's you. Why are you coming this late? Miss. Take me to the flat where the man before me went. But I'm not allowed to say where other customers go. You're a very gallant young man. Yes, that's true. But I can't say that it's the 402. If I say it, they'll fire me. Well, in that case don't say it. So let's go! You're really nice. You're overstating. -And a pretty boy too. Don't say that when I'm at work! Here's the fourth floor now! Yes, that's true. What you said was so sweet. Thank you. -No, thank you. Oh, Mary, it already feels like heaven. Give me the diamond. When will Paul give me the rest? Tomorrow, as soon as I get rid of this rock. Don't lose it! Help, a man! A man in my room! - Don't scream! What do you want? I'm almost naked! Leave or I call the police! Then you'll be arrested. What am I guilty of? This is my room. You room? It's mine, the 403! This is 402. Yes, that's right. In that case, you're right and I'm wrong. Sorry. Good night. Don't leave like this. -Will you arrest me? Don't be stupid, I wish to apologise. To me? Why? Well, first for frightening you. Then to be in the room to frighten you. And at last to have seen you almost naked. Not sure I understand, but you're really gallant. And you're really lovely! I think fate wanted you to find the wrong room. Why? -So I could meet beauty. I don't know what to say! -You're delightful! Will you have a drink with me? What's your name? -Marguerite. Pleasant coincidence, my name is Gautier. I work in finances. Finances... -Whiskey? Yes, a double. You must be an artist. Yes, a circus artist. Dancer? No, I work with tightropes. I drink to the most wonderful tightrope walker of the world! The most wonderful and the most divine. What a beauty ! Chief Fernandin? Chief? Red lips here. In room 402 of the Tyrol hotel, you'll find handcuffed a certain Mr Radek. He stole and smuggled the Kalman diamond. With your permission, I'll return the diamond to its owner. Bye bye. All right, one more time? 2 pastis 51! No, nothing for me. I can't see straight. That's good. Here, pay. -Already leaving? yes, I have business to do. But I'll be back tomorrow, same time. Good bye girl. -Well, say... Can't I come with you? Leave me alone dolly bird, learn not to be clingy! After shooting him several times he was tied to the radiator. -Correct. And everything seems to point that our mysterious friend red lips just committed a homicide. You think she killed him? Well, all I know is that she got herself into a real mess! And how much for that diamond? I don't know, I have no idea. Aren't you exaggerating a little bit? -Yes. Listen, it's worth at most 200 francs. What are you saying? It's a fake. Bad imitation made by an amateur. Well now we just have to celebrate our success. I don't get it. -Get it or no, we're done! This Radek guy was nice, I regretted hitting him. You think every thug is nice. And Mr Kalman isn't coming... It isn't time yet. - Maybe he got arrested for an unknown reason. - That's too much! My god, it's like they're crazy! Our dreadful crook Radek comes to Monaco and gives a diamond to an unknown guy, who then gives it to a gas station worker. Who did the gas station worker give it to? Will you tell me that? I have no idea. -To the same guy. All that poisonous nonsense for a worthless diamond. You're playing cops and robbers. That includes the honest Kalman who offers 1,000$ to get a worthless rock back. I'm not waiting anymore. So if I got it right we're still on the case. For me yes. I'm afraid that this guy isn't a billionaire and will get us in a mess. Soccer, soccer, race, multiple car crashes, a new born kills his parents in Pennsylvania, crime in Monaco Lola! Lola, wake up! Leave me alone. -No, no way! Why are you torturing me? Didn't you kill someone yesterday? I don't think so. Yet they say here that Red Lips murdered a man yesterday! Radek! Listen... You don't believe that... You're dumb! I already said that I didn't like this case at all! Radek must have been killed after I left the room and before the police arrived! Exactly. Don't worry, I'll get you a strong coffee and then we'll make our battle plan! Yes. She's here boss. -I see that you're at it again Rita. Sorry chief. I won't do it again. -Yes, alright. Go, I have work to do. Thanks. The red mark is still the same. A phone call "chief, chief". And yet I don't think that girl killed a man. Especially not that way. Neither do I, and yet the proofs... Yes, yes, the proofs, the proofs,... I want to keep investigating despite that. By the way, still no news from Prague? Sadly, no. Got a nice catch for you! Good evening sir. -I don't know that yet. Come on, thene. Yes sir. You're the elevator operator at the Tyrol hotel? Is that correct? -Yes sir. Well. So you were the one on duty when the crime was committed. -Yes chief. Do you know that you operated for a murderer? Yes sir, that's awful! So listen amongst the people who went to the 4th floor, we think that there was a woman. A young blond woman. -Yes sir. I remember her well. But you don't think that she... -Why not? Let's see... because, because it's impossible! We're the only ones deciding that young man. The only thing you have to do is to describe to us this blond woman. Why? -Listen... Try not to ask questions. And describe this woman. Uhm... well, I forgot her. I don't remember anything. You don't? Do you want us to refresh your memory? Yes, that's it. Now I remember all of it! She was rather small. About that size. And also, she was a brunette. And very skinny, and really skinny! All skin and bone! Her eyes were black like coal. Expressionless and without lashes. A real cure! -Yes, yes... And I guess she had a limp. -Yes sir! That's right, she even had crutches! Hello, Condor hotel? Can you tell me if Mr. Kalman is at home? Not the barman, Kalman! Yes, right, Kalman. What? He didn't came back? Thanks. -What's happening? Someone came to pay and take his luggage. But he didn't returnl. That takes the cake! -Well... I'll have to handle things. Enough nonsense, we've already been poisoned enough. What do you plan to do? Pay a visit to chief Fernandin. God dammit. It was time for you to appear. Sit in that chair so I can see your hands. Gladly, anything you want! I've been wanting to meet you. This is a lovely picture. -Why? Let's see... because of the gun. And mostly the mask. Will you allow me to smoke? -Yes, but don't try to... Have no fear. Because you're dressed up as a comic book character you think that I'll act like a cop in Superman. It's dark tobacco, want some? -No. Thanks. Of course, you must smoke Egyptians, with a one mile long cigarette-holder. Earlier you said that you expected me. Correct. That's why I set up the trap. -What trap? In every newspaper I accused you of murder. Do you think I'm guilty? -of course not. You're a brave kid. A little bit of an actress, a little bit ingenuous but unable of murder. I was convinced that after reading the news you'd come chat with me. Are you that interested in what I have to say? Yes, yes. This case is a game of poker, you have a few good cards, so do I. The best is to join our decks. Come on, put that gun away. Do I make some coffee? -No. As you wish. If I'm being so direct it's because you could be my daughter. Since you could be my father I wouldn't dare. Ok then. You're a detective. Amateur or professional, it's the same to me. You have a good thing. You're a pretty girl, clever, and an artist, could have been a great circus act! Red lips in her transformations! Brunette, redhead or blond! Maybe you can also change the color of your eyes. Yes, I have made a perfect act. To me wealth! No, because this time you got tricked. You think so? You work for a Kalman, diamond owner? Yes. A rather fat guy with smallpox? Yes. -So! Well, this isn't Kalman. We just got news from Prague. Kalman is around 65 years old, white hair, and he hasn't left his country in 6 months. So who's this one? Some scoundrel who tricked you. I doubt it's that simple. Because this man wasn't a crook. While obeying that man's orders, you got Radek's diamond and called me. And someone murdered Radek before you came. Yes, ok. Then the so-called Kalman doesn't show and flees from Monaco instead. Sorry, France. It's easy to think that fake Kalman made this to get rid of Radek and blame you for that. I find it hard to believe. The fake Kalman ran away because he was afraid. Of what? You're much smarter that what I thought. Indeed Something stays obscure though. I think Radek had the real diamond and someone managed to switch it before the rock reached his hands. And on the other hand, who could have killed Radek? Probably the same guy that switched the real diamond with a fake. But those are hypotheses. And the truth is that all the evidence points to a lovely young lady called Red Lips. If I don't find another culprit, I'll have to arrest you. I understand. I'll help you unmask the real murderer. Yes, but we don't have much time. I'm expected to arrest you. Give me time. -Granted. Let's say 15 days. -No. Only 10. Ok. We'll use those 10 days to find the solution to the problem. Perfect, but if you and I don't find the culprit in that period, I'll have to arrest you. I think that now that we're knowing each other you realize that if I want to find you, I'll find you. I hope this won't be necessary. Thanks for everything. Now I'll leave. You'll forgive me for precautions that you find childish. But I'll turn the light off. And don't move for a minute! And talk loudly so I know where you are. Will you? It seems a little bit stupid, but if it pleases you. Talk, talk, talk... About what? I don't know what to say. In the past France was called Gaul. At last you're here, where have you been? I had a lot to do, but now I'm free. Well lucky us! Really? Yes darling, because I'm free too, we can go on a trip you'll never forget! You robbed a bank, heh? No, I got lucky. Today I'm rich! Rich? We have to celebrate! Yes, but not here. Time to change of place. Why? I like this bar. And I want us to drink champagne! Like the millionaires in the movies! So let's head to the adventure! You're right doll, and I'll offer you something really interesting. So let's go. What do you wish? Drinks buddy! I already told to sit next to me. That's the shit! This is the life! Champagne and beautiful broads! And still yesterday I hadn't 50 bucks in my pocket! You must have earned a lot of money. Money you say? Money! cash, moolah dough, mountains of dough! You made quite a deal! A deal, you can say that! A funny deal, the best deal of the century! You're bothering us. That's for you. I like you, you've got a nice face. Thanks sir, thanks. What was I saying? Let's go somewhere else. Why elsewhere? You're drunk, anyway I know a quiet place, that's my house. Oh no. If I want to take you home, you hear, because this guy is getting on my nerves with his pan pan pan. If he keeps doing that he'll hurt his hands! How much? It'll be 1,500 francs. One minute, how much? 1,500 Here, 25, 25 and 25 more, and 1,000 Goodbye, nice trip. Let's go baby. I forgot the tip. -Thanks. Come on! Here, we've arrived to my pad. Keep quiet dummy, turn the light on! Of course sweetie, of course. Come, come, everything belongs to me! I bought everything. And it cost me a lot, you know? I was tired of living in a hotel room. Come see this, and admire. Isn't it great? See, I've also got a piano. Everyone in France has a piano, makes you look rich. You don't even know how to play it? It doesn't matter, it's about the effect especially when there's a vase in it. But you probably know, heh? You're wonderful darling. What deal did you do Charlie? You shouldn't be nosy. I'm just interested in everything about you. Weren't you listening? No, not at all. Leave me. Are you afraid? Me? No. I'll get mad if you don't tell me. Very well, sweetheart. I'll tell you everything. Well... I work for a guy the one who came in the other day. and for other guys at the same time. What does that mean? Hey, young man! Hello my friend Hello miss, gas? -No. Oil? -No. Water? Air? Brake fluid? -No thanks. Why are you stopping here then? Can I ask you a favor? -Of course. Where's your colleague, the dark-haired tall and elegant man? Who, Pablo? Himself, I'm one of his compatriot. You're from Argentina too? That's right, I'm from Mar Del Plata. Pablo doesn't work here anymore, he only stayed a couple days. Do you know where he went? No, we barely spoke to each other. Kind of a show-off. Yes, I'll admit that he's pretentious. Do you know where he lives? Toto! Where does Pablo live? Pablo? I don't know and I don't care. You heard it. -Can't you remember? No, I'm sorry. Did he mention anything? A bar he went to? Wait... I think he once mentioned a weird place. Yes! He told me he was going to a nightclub, because he was a man with refined taste. Remember, what was it called? A rather strange name. -The Flamenco? No. -The Joker? No, far more exotic. Yes, I think that the word gold was in it. The Golden Star! -Sorry? Can you repeat? -The Golden Star! Yes, that's it! I think you found it. You're welcome darling. I don't think I've ever seen you here. I've never been here. Are you an artist? Can't you tell? Holidays? -Forced, yes. It's hard here. I want to talk to Pablo. -The butler? Is he here? -Yes he is. Someone for you! -What do you want? You're not Pablo! But I am. -Not the one I'm looking for. There's no other Pablo. They said he works here and could recommend me. They fooled you. -Shut up. I'm completely open to recommend you. Why don't we have dinner tomorrow? It's so important to me! Life is so hard! -You, shut up! What do you do? -I'm a dancer. Acrobatic dancer? -No, rather... eccentric. -Well, let's have dinner tomorrow. Here? -You, shut up! Here, or in the other club. There's another club? -Yes. Even fancier, a real palace of the 1001 nights in a wonderful setting. Is that where the other Pablo is? -Yes, that's it! You, shut up, maybe big Pablo doesn't want... Why, who is he? He's kind of the owner. Tall? Brown haired? Around 30. -Yes, exactly! You won't stay long here. -Tell me about this other Pablo. Tomorrow we'll talk about him over dinner. Could you advise? Sure, Pablo is there every night. Didn't he go to Monaco recently. -Yes, he stayed a few days. How many days? Can you say? Yes. Why do you care so much? Because I'm broke and need a job. I'll give him a letter to sort things out. We're friends. He slaps my shoulder to prove it. Friendly of course. -When will you give me the letter? Tomorrow after dinner. -Why not today? Aren't we dining tomorrow? And I warmly recommend to you those two marvelous exotic dancers, the two Lolas. I think they'd be a number appropriate for the customers of your cabaret, jabber, jabber... What will the two Lola do? You heard, exotic dancers. But I never danced in my life! Don't worry, we'll create a show in 10 mins. Now hurry up, we have to leave. -Why? Else I'll have to go to dinner with an old butler with wandering hands. Who knows where this story will lead us? Don't worry, it'll be tons of fun! Yes, it was time we had to deal with bad boys with good taste. Listen, music. That's some nice broads! Here it is, our nicest bungalow. Luckily, it's free since yesterday. I like it very much. I'll leave you. At your service. -Thanks. Nice, isn't it? It's wonderful, and what a beautiful view! Real holidays! Still need us miss? -No, a million thanks. A million each but zero tip... Now I'll put a disc on. Give me the switchboard. This place is marvelous! We are going to create our recital. Hello, yes, what do you want? Pablo. He isn't here. Who's asking? Back soon? No idea. You might meet him here at five. Hes auditioning. At five, attractions audition. Really? Then get to work now! But you're nuts, where did you find that disc? That's a secret. It's rather uncommon. You don't even understand the title. You'll see honey, it'll be really fun. Let's start. -What do I do? Look. That's enough for today. Come on Lina. Listen! Listen to me. Hey, I called you. -I heard. What's going on? Nothing. -Doesn't work with me. Neither with me. Are you jealous? You have to love for that. Exactly, I thought you loved me. I don't care about you. But listen: I know lots of things about you. More than you think. I only care about you as a partner. You understand I hope. So here's a serious warning: Don't try to get rid of me or to leave me! Because you'd pay for that. I'm capable of anything. Now you know. Why talk like that? Can't we start over? I can't forgive. I was wrong to believe those times before. I went along and forgave you. I did that because I loved you. But today that's over. I know you're sick of me, that you want to let me go. But remember that it's too late to break us apart. We have too much in common When you came to this country you had nothing but an empty wallet. You met me and we built all this together. I'm not ready to forgive again. Out of selfishness. So, listen. don't ever do that again. Very well. I hope you'll change your mind. So that's you? Indeed, that's us. Can you do anything? -Yes, we dance. I'd hire them without watching it. I'd rather see it. Raoul. I'm here boss. -Let them practise. And the score? What score? -The music! We don't have any. You dance without music? No, but it's not dance music What are you saying? -We need old records. Yes, from ancient Rome. Perfect, old is trendy now, Help me. Do you have a plug? -There. What's your name? -Lola. I had a bride named Lola. -What did you do with her? She left me. Dumb girl! Off we go Lola! And now, you'll see something extraordinary. How about those contortions? Either we hide them in a cabin or it's this year's hit. We'll see. Welcome. Hello, we booked the lodge for Mr Kalman. Yes, it is ready. Are you Mr Kalman? No, I'm Carlo Moroni, Mr Kalman's secretary. Ok. You can keep the car, I'll walk At your command. Is it that way? It's not needed Mr Kalman, I took care of everything. Then shut up and drive. -Of course. That way sir. I came in as you were getting the panther out. Long holiday, Mr Kalman? Sorry? -I'm not on holidays. I apologize. I meant do you plan on staying a few days? I hope not. And stop asking stupid questions. Be rich and happy thanks to the soup "The little chick" win a trip on the french riviera! A fridge! 50 pair of shoes, all that thanks to the soup "The little... Give me Mr Kalman. Hello -Hello Is it you Kalman? No, it's Moroni, his secretary. -Tell the old man to come. Can I stand in? -No. No, it's rather personal. Who are you? Kalman's grandmother. Hello, listening. I think you're interested in a diamond. I came here for that. -Yes, I know. I called you in Prague. I have the diamond. It's worth 100,000 dollars. If you have them, come tomorrow at the pier. Come alone. So you don't have any trouble. I assure you that I will. I'm old and half disabled. Losing that diamond was so hard for me. I'm in your hands. Perfect. I want 100,000 dollars. In small bills. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. At last. -Who was that? We'll find tomorrow. Don't rush. Whoever it is will repent for being bold enough to steal from me! The two birds you hired ain't bad. -I like them too. Yes, I noticed. This way gentlemen. What would you like? A bottle of champagne. And some fruits for me. We have Mr Kalman. Give him a bottle of champagne. On the house. Well well, did you get a sense of humor? That's a nice artist. They are wonderful. -They dance really well. No, they dance badly, but still wonderful. You're right, especially the blonde. The brunette. Careful -Of who? That guy you kept looking at with your big eyes. Thanks, that proves I'm a good actor. Don't worry, he's more likely to fall in love with me than the other way. Very well, I warned you anyway. Rest assured, my guardian angel. Hey girls, you're in luck, the old millionaire's interested, read this. Would you accept a glass of champagne? Your admirer, Alexis Kalman. What do you think? -You should be careful too. That Kalman is a famous man! He's very rich with gems. Really? He won't last long. Hes about 70 years old. Is he the real Kalman? Of course, it's not fake. Maybe there are two. -Two? One is fooling the other. That's for sure! Can you dance? No, but I can try, right? Well, now is the time. And I met Lina. -Does she love you? She loves me deeply. Nothing is easier than falling in love. I know, even if you don't want to. You aren't going to tell me that you're in love with me? No, not yet. But I feel like this will come soon. Oh Mr Kalman, my dear Mr Kalman! You must be mistaken, I'm not Mr Kalman. How weird, don't you remember me, honey? No miss. Here's Mr Kalman. I'm Moroni, his secretary. What? This old guy is Kalman? Really, you don't remember me? No girl, you see that he doesn't! But sit and tell us. -You hear? Sit. Your friends are really polite. We are, have a drink. What drink? -Bromine. I heard it calms! Stop now gentlemen. Quiet! Where did you meet Kalman? In Monaco, where else? So you went to Monaco. Why didn't you tell us? I've never been there. Well look at that, what a liar! I know you were in Monaco two weeks ago. You lived in the Astor residence. Now do you remember sweetie? So, do you remember sweetie? Of course you knew him in Monaco. You should be nicer, it's not a girl you forget like that. You lied and I know why! You said you'd go to Milan see your mom! I swear I don't know her! It's a frame-up! I don't know what she wants to do with that story! Sit, Moroni. You should be ashamed. Sorry miss. I invited you to have a drink with us and you've heard nothing but unpleasantness since. You're too kind Mr Kalman. I'm sure that you you won't forget me so easily. Right? You're completely right. As to your lack of memory Moroni, I think we will have to find a cure. A personal secretary must remember everything, else he'd risk provoking situations like this. That are very unpleasant, you'd agree. Good night Mr Kalman, it was an honor. Good night. I dare hope that I'll be lucky enough to see you again. I hope that too. Good night. Miss, stay! Don't go! I'll go with her. You're coming with us! -Leave him! He can say what he wants. Good night Mr Kalman. Good night. Miss, wait a moment. What do you want? -Just talk to you. I don't see what we'd talk about. Listen, I beg you miss, it's much more important than you think. I understood why you put on that act. You're red lips, right? How do you know? You're the only woman I met in Monaco. Why did you make fun of me all night? You also made fun of me Mr Moroni. Don't think that! Because I was the one who risked everything! Everything? -Yes. You pretend to be Kalman, you make me recover a fake diamond and you disappear? Well, let's forget this. I want to give you a much more important mission. I'm not interested. I hate when people make fun of me. Good night. Wait, hear me out. Very well. I'll explain everything. You should have started with that. I told you that Mr Kalman's diamond was stolen. It happened when he was at a conference in Prague. I was the one who answered the phone. I didn't say anything to Mr Kalman. I arranged a meeting with the thief in Monaco. Still without Mr Kalman knowing it. I must have been insane. I thought I could get the diamond back, sell it and get a fortune back. I contacted you when I came to Monaco instead of calling the police. And to me, those negotiations represented several millions. But someone found out. Killed Radek, and replaced the real diamond with a fake. Probably one of Radek's accomplices. After that I was scared, I didn't want to be caught. And I chose to run away. Today... I think I'm discovered. I don't want be involved in criminality. Leave me out of this. And you want to hire me again? What for? All that I want is you to say to Mr Kalman that it was a joke and you don't know me. That's a lie. -You don't have to lie Say whatever you want. -That for so little money? You'd have to add a lot of millions to make me lie, sir. You've become very scrupulous... A swindle! Leave now Mr Moroni. I didn't want that. I beg you. I beg you to help me! You know them They're capable of anything. Even kill me! You're a dirty coward! Defend yourself! When you gave me that mission you knew the risks! So you... you won't help me? No. Goodbye. Anyone home? Why do you do that to your best friend? I thought you were still with Pablo. I went to bed an hour ago. Was he already sick of you? I had to put him back in his place. Hello? Miss, please give me Monaco. 35 40 70. What? Pass him now. They're doing it right now! Am I still dreaming? -Hello? I'm sorry to disturb, but I miss talk to chief Fernandin now! What? Oh... No, no, I'll call later. Thanks. Bye. The chief isn't at his office. He left two hours ago for pressing matters. Wonderful! Where could he go? I swear he wasn't with me. Be serious, we only have 5 days until the deadline he gave us! Do you think things will be better by interrupting my sleep? No, you're right. Let's go. We have nothing left to do here. That water is so appealing! -Yes, make us want to go away. Should we swim to that rock? I'd rather enjoy the sun. And after some imagination work, we'll rise and take a real bath. No, please. I don't want to stay here. Penguins scare me and I saw 5 or 6 nearby. Very well, if you wish we'll go on a cruise. Here, on that ship. Where will it go? -It doesn't matter. It'll take us wherever it wants. See? We arrive in Hawaii. Honolulu's harbor. How wonderful! Spend a few days. Living carefree the tropical night, the distant song of the natives. And hula hoop? Wouldn't you like it? In that case let's go! Yes, we should leave. Have you thought about it? -Yes I have. Listen, I might be very rich tonight. I want to leave the country. We'll go wherever we want. The world will be ours! Have you really thought about this? No, I'm used to doing what I feel Why think about it? Today, what I want is being with you, far away. Just the two of us. -For how long? I don't know. Maybe one hour. Maybe forever. You see I mean it, I could lie though. I do know. You're a strange man. Attractive, but dangerous. I... -She, no. No, now don't say anything. Wait till tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll pick you up. A seat will be free for you in my car. If you wish, think, but I hope you'll listen to your feelings. We'll see tonight. No, I can't go to the golden star. Tonight I... I'll be very busy darling. What time is it? -One. Well it's chillier than yesterday. Mr Kalman, my dear Mr Kalman. Please give us the honor of your presence. Thank you very much. Isn't your friend Mr Moroni coming tonight? Mr Moroni had to leave town in a hurry, my dear. You want a drink? -Yes. A whiskey. Double. You look great. -I'd think so. Are you in love? -Who knows? What is that? -Paul Gagret. She's starting tomorrow, don't you know her? No, what does she do? She dances, she was here several times. She has a nice act. Yes, come in. Come in! Water! Come on, hurry up. Why would I hurry ? I missed the screening anyway. We'll get him out so he can enjoy the air. And what movie did you miss? A western. -Another dumb movie. With Alan Ladd, in cinemascope and color! Relax. Tell us where the diamond is. I don't know, I don't have it. Come on, leave him! Tell us, we don't want to hurt you. It's the truth, I don't have it. Then why did you come? To meet a guy. I don't have the diamond, but he does. Stay calm. Come on, listen. Don't hit him, he can't take it! Spill the beans, tell us who got it. It's Moroni. He stole it from Radek in Monaco. Very well, go on. I came, Moroni sent me. And when did you see him? Last night at the Golden Star. -Maybe he's telling the truth. Where'd that fatty hide the diamond? I don't know, I swear it. And what order did he give for Kalman? I had to drive him to a place. -Tell us where! Even better, you'll drive us to it right now! I'll drive you but you have to help me. I can't move. Gladly, drip. We need a boat. To go for 3km headed towards the harbor. A private pier, and there, there's a house. -Ok, let's go. And I'd advise you to not do anything stupid! Don't worry, your friends didn't leave me enough energy for that. Come on, hurry up. Get down. Hurry up. Is it here? -Yes. Think it's a trap? If he did that he'll pay a lot for it. Come on, go first. I'll go in first. Sure, but I'm watching you. Warning, I come with two friends of Mr Kalman. I want the way to be clear. Be careful Lina! Miss, get me my driver right now. Where are you going? Going for a walk. With your Pablo, right? -Yes, with my Pablo. Thank you for coming. Who did that to you? Just a small accident. Will you come with me? -I don't know. When I'm near you, I think so, but... We'll go tonight. No, no it's impossible you can't move. Yes I can, you'll see. Here take this radio. It's like a lucky charm. Keep it with you at the hotel until I come for you. I won't move. See you later. Hey pretty. -Is it a trade union meeting? No, it looks more like a funeral. See you later. Have fun. Sorry miss, you dropped something. Thank you very much. -You're welcome. Who is that girl? One of the two Lolas. -What does she do? She's good at seducing nearby dudes. Why not? It's less dangerous between friends. What do you mean? I saw her the other day in the street. She was with the boss the night he didn't come. Are you sure? Come. It's time we pay them a visit. Is that you Lola? Yes? Well, open! Lina, what a pleasure! What a pleasure, eh? And that's nothing compared to what's coming. The other one now. And watch closely all the exits. Yes chief. Be careful Lola! I'm doing everything I can! What's the matter with her? That's enough! You'll pay, you bitch! What? I didn't do anything! Slut! You thought you'd get away. I'll get you, don't worry. Help! So, everything all right? No. What's the matter? This case disgusts me. In our country the crimes are so much more pleasant. The Lima tries to stab her mother. The driller blows a safe up. The mama sells fake parrots, the Rita, she... well, she's the Rita. But those international crooks... -Kalman is here. Maybe he could give us some tips. Oh dear. -My head! Do you know how many days are left until the end of the period the chief gave us? Of course I know, two. -One, because it's after midnight. I think this case will soon be over. And sadly, it'll end badly for us. And this goddamn diamond, where is it? It probably doesn't even exist! Come in. Good evening, I'm waiting outside with the cab. It's from Pablo. He said you should come with the radio. I'll be outside. -I'm coming. Good bye. What should I do? -Go Lola! I'm afraid. -Having doubts? It's our only asset left! Listen Lola. No turning back now. Think of the final success. We must risk it all. It's the only way to get the diamond back. And what will we do with it next? What do you think, just look at it? A nice reward after all the poison that dirty rock gave us. Kalman will surely buy it! Then I can buy a mink coat! Sure thing! I'm leaving now! -Wherever you go, you'll be followed by three cops. I'll play my role on my side too. My dear, I guarantee you a new creation! At a given time, I'll scream and create confusion. then you'll use the panic to meet Pablo and take the diamond. Who, me? -Of course. That's appealing. That's all I have to do? Almost nothing. Yes -Easy work. While I'm at it, don't you want the plans of the place either? No, not this. I'll get out, this ambiance tires me. I'll get some fresh air. It stinks too much of tobacco. What's happening? What's the matter, is she sick? Good night miss. -Good night. You have to... -No, no, no. Take her to her dressing room. Wait for me here. Gentlemen, a bit of music. Our dear sick person. How is she? Do you feel better beauty? A bit better, thanks. Poor darling. Oh, my head! That'll do, enough with the act. What does all this mean? You can always guess it. And your friend? Why don't you ask Pablo? Pablo... Did he leave with that... ? Maybe he's starting to get good taste. I don't think that'll last long. Here we go! That's my deal. Let's leave. With this we can go wherever we want. I'm scared Pablo, they're chasing us. Have you heard that? It's probably a boat. How do you feel now? Unwell Mr Kalman. It hurts so much, it's awful! My poor head hurts. -Poor little girl. Yet I feel happy. -I don't understand. Because I know I can speak openly. You still want your diamond? -Why, did you find it? I think so. I'll be honest with you. Because you're a kind man. You'll give me a nice reward. You should never think you know people. A reward, rest assured. A wonderful reward. Don't move. Why didn't it occur to me that you were the Pablo of our story? Don't you remember me? Pablo Yose, Argentinian? naturalized American. Year 1953, hold up. Year 1955, swindle. Year 1958, arrested for presumption of murder. You've progressed Pablo. But this time the game is over. No, not yet. Let me go! Don't move. And drop your weapon! Don't do anything stupid and surrender, that's my advice. Don't move! Don't be stupid. You know we'll arrest you and it'll be worse. If you surrender now, we'll remember it. Don't move. -Surrender, don't do anything stupid! You know that no one escape justice. If you don't leave I'll shoot. And? You'll kill me? That won't change anything. There are a lot of policemen. And if it isn't me, it'll be another who'll arrest you. Don't waste your time. Surrender Pablo. -So you wanted it, uh? You won chief. Poor boy. Why do people like that exist? Here's your diamond. Cheers my lady! And now, your reward. Did you think I was stupid enough to let you leave with money and Alexis' Kalman secret? What do you mean? I regret you dying so young. But I can't let you out. Relax. Get in the car! Chief? -Get in! Let's go. So it was you chief? -Yes. I managed to save Red lips from Kalman's ill intent. So you knew? "Hello chief, hello chief" Of course I knew, I'm not that dumb! And where do you take us? -Monaco. To arrest us? No, to see if you'll finally leave me alone! Thanks chief, you're an angel! Won't you miss us? Yes, maybe... Now let me sleep! I need to regain my strength. I can't wait till we get to Monaco. Are you in a hurry? Well, tomorrow is Sunday. Aperitif at 11AM, a nice lunch and for the afternoon: football. Good night! Good night chief. -Good night.
