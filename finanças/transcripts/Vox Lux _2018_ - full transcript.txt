Celeste was born in America in 1986. Considering her parents' background, education, and socioeconomic status, being somewhat on the losing side of Reaganomics, the name of Latin origin seemed an especially poetic choice. It carved her out some predetermined destination, a route which to travel by. And many years before "Celeste" rolled off the cultural tongue like a principled anecdote one senses they were born knowing, she might not have been described as all that special or conspicuously talented. However, she did possess that proverbial "something," which on occasion captured the attention of her teachers and young peers. Despite what naysayers later perceived of her ingenuity, she was actually a very savvy businesswoman. In the beginning, she was kind and full of grace, and at least she wrote her own lyrics. No one could take that away from her. She would be 13 going on 14 years old in the year 2000, the dawn of the new millennium. Morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Hello. - Welcome back. - Good morning. - Hi. Happy New Year. Therese, did you change your hair? Uh, my sister cut it. She's a hairdresser. Oh. Does she work in town? I want a cut like that. Really? Uh, well, she lives out of state. She was visiting us for the holidays, but I can let you know when she's back. Would you mind? Sometimes you feel like a change. Sure, I can. - Hello. - What's up? - Good morning. - Hi. - Hi. Welcome back. - Good morning. Okay. Welcome back, everybody. - Did you enjoy the break? - Yes. Yeah. - Did you enjoy the break? - Yes. Well, I received news from Vice Principal Kane about our homeroom computer appeal. What is it? I want to wait and share it once everyone's arrived. We're waiting on, um, Eric and Elyse. Well, they're probably gonna take a while. Why is that? Aidan, let's not start the year off at odds. Whatever you're saying to him, you can save it for after class. He's here. I saw Eric five minutes ago. - All right, then. We'll wait. - Are we getting desktops? - I said we'll wait. - Excuse me. Yes? My name is Cullen Active. What? Yes, Cullen, I know. Celeste? Celeste, go stand in the back with the others. Is she breathing? No. Celeste, you need to get up and step away from the windows, because in a few minutes there will be an explosion. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Stop! Stop! I'm standing. I'll stand. Now everyone, please shut up and be quiet. Go back inside! Cullen? Cullen, please let us go. I killed plenty of people already. I'm sorry. I can't do that now. Please. At least let everyone else go. I'll stay here with you. And what are we gonna do? We'll pray together. Shh. Everything's gonna be... - Clear. - Adam Seven, clear in the classroom. Clear! Adam Seven, be advised... multiple 80s. Room 206, second floor. Breathe in and hold your breath. Breathe. What are you feeling now? I feel like I'm on a boat. Nausea won't subside? It's not just that. I just feel like I'm spinning. You think it's in my head? No, I don't think it's in your head at all. I just don't think it has anything to do with your spinal injury. I need to sit. I'll get your chair. Just a minute. Come on. Do you want to try a few more steps? Okay. Good. All right. - There you go. - Where's Dad and Eleanor? They went to get us some food. Some of the other kids have been complaining about their ears ringing from the gun blasts. I talked to her doctor about it, and... Great. - Hey, Mrs. Howard. - Hello, Miss Celeste. I'm so sorry I was sick. I should've been there for you. I'm so grateful you're alive. I think I would have died... or just killed myself. I don't think I could've standed it. I'm here now, and I am never going to leave you. Ever. My God. Ellie, I think I've done something terrible. What is it? It says here they found Cullen's grandparents. They think that he shot both of them three weeks before Christmas and lived with the bodies over the holiday. - Ew! - Dad... - Excuse me. - Stop. I'm sorry. There are some news people here requesting an interview. Oh, well, don't look at me. It's up to her. I don't want anyone to see me like this. You look fine. Can you talk to them? Me? What am I supposed to say? I wasn't there. Just tell them how sorry we are for everyone that died. Call Mom. Are you sure? I can take you to a telephone. Thanks, babe. - I think I want to try and sleep for a while. - Good. I think I am going to try and take your mother out to dinner or something. Get her mind off of things. Sure you don't need anything else other than that keyboard? You know, I have a guitar in the basement. Could bring that over, teach you a little. Thanks, but... it's hard for me to tilt my head down. So it starts like... so, one, two, three. Yeah. Twice. ...remain in critical condition. Hold them especially in your prayers. Please join me now by turning to the page 13. I was informed earlier, and I guess some of you are already aware, of last night's arson attempt over at the Active residence. Lieutenant Lynne at the 120th Precinct has asked me to remind everyone that that is the site of an ongoing investigation, and its destruction would... gravely impair their officers' ability to provide answers to the community's many pressing questions. I would like to add... ferocious anger prompted this, and we cannot have any more anger or violence around us this minute. I'll go a step further by asking you all to please include the perpetrator of these vicious attacks in your prayers. By this way of healing prayer and forgiveness, victims of this tragedy will be... released from their own grief and rage in the afterlife. Throughout the night, we'll be asking New Brighton students to come up and share memories and recollections with us. Please join me in welcoming Celeste Montgomery from Stephanie Dwyer's eighth-grade class. Um, I tried to prepare something to say, but... I couldn't really put my feelings into words exactly, so I thought I'd do this instead. Uh, my sister, Ellie, helped me a lot.

It was not her grief; it was theirs. No longer merely her experience, they reclaimed it as their own. Over the course of the following year, The song would become an anthem for the nation.

Celeste, let's take five. Meet me in the hall. You okay in there, or are you in over your head? - No, I'm good. - You trust me? Do you trust me? Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. That's good, 'cause I've been doing this a long time, and I can understand if it's little overwhelming, but you have to trust the process. The process works. That's why you and your parents chose me to guide you through this... strange and unpredictable new process. So I want you to remember what I told you at your parents' place the first time we met. You got to shut your eyes and pretend like you're in your bedroom. You're just dancing in your bedroom, and no one's looking at you, and you ain't got a care in the world, okay? Okay. You got to tell me if I'm not making any sense, 'cause you got your head screwed on so straight half the time I forget you're a kid. Don't worry yourself too much about the technical stuff, 'cause I'm telling you, these people are not here to listen to that fuckin' bass player riff like he's Jaco Pastorius, hmm? - Okay. - This is your show, okay? Remember that. Run it. Okay? - You ready to get back into it? - Yeah. - Good. - But can you do me a favor? - Yeah. - Can you watch your language around Ellie? It really bothers her when people swear. Yeah, so I'm sorry. I-I, uh... I-I didn't realize I was swearing at you. I wasn't thinking. I'm sorry. Okay. So I just quickly cut something together for the first and the last verse, and it actually seems like it's working really well. We might be over-thinking it. In the first verse, though, there's a little crack or a hiccup or something in your delivery of "'Cause I missed the train." So maybe we should just take it from there? Great. I'll nail that. Then we can get started on "Body Talk." I'm sorry, what section is that? It's the next track. Okay. Yeah. Let's get a head start on tomorrow. Okay, here we go. I'm sorry I'm late. Thank you for waiting. Have you girls been enjoying your stay? Yeah. The hotel's very nice. Yeah. It's great. So, what's next? She beat me to the punch. Well, a few things. First, I've been meaning to ask you if you, uh, have any background in dance, or if your injury - prevents you from... - I used to take ballet. And no. I just have to be careful. That's great. Internally we've been discussing a few upcoming events, performances we'd like to pitch you for, and we'd love to set you up with a choreographer. What kind of appearances? In-store performances, things like that. It's a great way to introduce your live experience to the public and a great way for you to get your feet wet in turn. Uh, Celeste, we really love what you do here, but after everything you've been through, I just think it's necessary to be really straight with you and let you know that there is no guarantee that these new tracks will work. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. She's 14 years old. You don't need to talk that way to her. Talk to me that way, not her. Let me finish, please. it would be unconscionable for me to not make a young person like yourself fully cognizant of the reality of the situation. You've given us a great demo, and we are going to pitch it hard, but... the rest is out of our hands. It's fine. If it works, great. If not, that's okay too. Well, that's great. On to the fun stuff then. This is what we had in mind in terms of artwork for the EP that we'll be sending to the stations. - What do you think? - I like it. It's peach. We can change the color. Just for now, try and focus more on the feeling of the layout. - I like it. - I like it too. Great. They know what they like. That's great. We love it. The lyric inside of the font gives it precedence, the advent of a new voice being announced. But the most important thing to us is that you feel well-represented. I feel well-represented. As your representative, I'd like to express how highly unusual and inappropriate that woman's conduct was. I had no idea she was gonna sit down and give you a list of reasons that she's not to be held accountable if she fails at her job. These salespeople are mostly the same. Five minutes into a meeting you know they couldn't sell a lifejacket to Natalie Wood. She was just telling me not to get my hopes up. Of course you should get your hopes up. Come on. So, from here, pulling through five, walking six, seven, and down eight. Uh-huh, good. So to do that slide, and you want to think of actually lifting up as you're going down, okay? You'll get more length on the slide. Let me see it. - Good. You okay? - Yeah, I'm good. - You sure? - I'm fine. - We can take a break if you need. - No, no, I'm okay. Okay. I'm gonna put the disc on, and let's go from the top. ♪ I, I, I, I ♪ ♪ I, I, I, I ♪ - Finding the beat. - ♪ I, I, I, I ♪ Ready? Step right, left. Good. Grapevine. Going forward. And going down. Good, okay. When the chorus comes in, try to sing along with the track, to see how that feels, okay? And just focus on breathing, because you want to have enough air to get through the track. Okay? Ready? Five, six, seven, eight. Keep going. Good. Step. Low. And hit. Good. And right. Left. Walk. Up. Good. That feel okay? - Yeah. - Good, good. Is this what you wanted to see? Huh? Is this what you wanted to see? They came into our house... The government called it Operation Reunion, a delicate mission carried out with military precision. No one was seriously injured. What if you get really big? First of all, I don't think that's even happening. And second, even if it did, it's not like I wouldn't come home all the time. Really think I'm gonna be able to get in anywhere? Totally. You look like you're 22. No way. You do. "Excuse me, sir. Have you met my baby sister? She's so sexy, isn't she?" Shut up. It's true. You're the pretty one, and you sing better than me. I know. And I'm bigger than you too. Stop! Stop! Sorry. Hurts my back. - I'm not dressed. - Okay. Got a call from the label, from that P.R... bitch. - You want to hear about it? - Is it bad? - You gonna let me in? - Ellie's getting dressed. - They shopped it around to radio. - And what? And you did it. She says "Alive" and "Hologram" tested in the mid-90s. What about the other ones? They did fine, I think, but you got two, for Christ sake. You needed exactly one to work. You don't seem excited. Well, you don't seem very excited either. I'm thrilled. Just didn't come as much of a surprise. A & R is sending through a list of their acts they think you can open for in the spring. - I can't believe it. - Listen, I'm sending you home for a week or two. I want you to rest up, 'cause guess what? I'm taking you to Stockholm after the break. - Really? - It's in Europe. - I know. - They want enough tracks for an album. I want you working with this guy. The best. You'll know his stuff when you hear it. He's written everything. Hits. I told him, make space for you. He said okay if we come to him. - Oh. - So whatever you got... half-written, ideas, whatever you got... let's go lay it down. You hear that, Ellie? See? I told you you'd get really big. Following a short visit home with their parents, Celeste's manager had the girls' passports expedited, and the three of them set flight for an unfamiliar if not particularly exotic foreign city, where they would go on to have many uniquely first experiences. Stockholm was home to what business scholars and economic geographers call an industry cluster, an agglomeration of talent, business infrastructure, and competing firms all swirling around one industry in one place. In the 1940s, church leaders and cultural conservatives rallied together around a solemn mission: to safeguard the country's youth against the degenerate music that was being piped in from America. To combat this threat, municipal schools of music spread across the country, offering morally uplifting instruction in classical music. One thing would eventually to another. Born at the height of this morally uplifting boom at the close of the second war, Swedish producer Tor Erik Romstad was initially skeptical but grew increasingly fond of the inseparable sisters. And though he considered himself a beat-up old atheist that had been phoning it in for some time in the pop music game, he found the girls' kind-hearted devotion to God, music, and most importantly, one another, to be altogether inspiring. Over the course of five weeks, he would turn out some of his career's most addictive hooks and melodies. So far oblivious to the impending deluge of notoriety these tracks would soon afford her, Celeste primarily enjoyed getting all this one-on-one time with Eleanor. They never could've dreamed they would one day casually travel to Europe together, unsupervised and unattended. On weekends, Eleanor enjoyed playing the role of the big sister by taking Celeste around to the nearby bars and local dance clubs. Before the massacre at New Brighton, Eleanor might never have dared to share these more disgraceful aspects of her recreational appetites with her young sibling. But considering all the suffering Celeste had endured, she was surely old enough now to engage in the more pleasurable parts of adulthood also. Celeste felt alive, creative, and autonomous, in command of her own destiny. Baby, he's calling again. We're gonna miss our flight. It's so early. Tell him I don't think I can get on a plane. I don't believe this shit. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. - No, I'm sorry. - No, don't say you're sorry. Just don't do it. It's the same old shit with all you kids over and over. Your parents trusted me. I take that seriously. Are you smiling? Are you smiling? Don't smile at me. It's just that you're funny. Don't yell at me. I'll stop yelling when you wipe that condescending beam off your face. Guess what? Since you two both decided to completely fuck off and do whatever you please, with zero consideration for what a terrible position you put me in... morally, ethically, legally... from now on, I veto your request, and will swear and fuckin' curse as much as I please. 'Cause guess what? I'm not buying this innocent little girl shit you two are selling. Fine. It's a deal. Just stop yelling. I'm obviously not yelling. You have 12 hours to lie knocked out on a plane and get your act together. And what? Think about what I've done? I called your room 10 times. What happens in 12 hours? - Going to L.A. to make a video. - What? Did you enjoy the show? - What? - Did you like the show? Oh, sorry. I actually just got here. He's your manager? How did you guys connect? He saw me sing on TV. Oh, I'm Celeste. Can I get you a drink, Celeste? No, I'm good, thanks. I have to work early tomorrow. I'm making a video. Are you in it? Well, I hope so. It's a video for a song I made. Well, what kind of music do you make? - I'm embarrassed to say. - Why? I don't want you to make fun of me. I'm not gonna make fun of you. Pop music. Ah, I love pop music. - No you don't. - Of course I do. Who doesn't love pop music? What are you doing? Let's go back. I want you to meet somebody. - I know your brother. - Yeah, we've met around. Yeah. Celeste. Are you all right? I've taken a load of pills before the set 'cause I was nervous, and I think I need some new stuff to counteract the old stuff. Do you have any drugs in the room? Only painkillers. Oh. Okay. I have to go back downstairs and get a new key. I think I grabbed my sister's. That is nice. I love this shit. Yeah. This is brilliant. This is, like, the best song I've ever heard. Shut up. You left out a drop and crawl. I'm not doing that. You do it. Fine. I will. Get off my stage. Stop. Oh, God. Stop! Stop! You make the same sort of music the boy who attacked me used to listen to. Does that remind you of him? It did, just this moment. I hope that doesn't upset you too much. It doesn't. I think when you meet someone who's going to become an important figure in your life, that... it forces us to look back at the past so we can get on with the future, is all. In my defense, maybe it was the thing that pushed that kid over the edge, or... maybe it was the only thing that could've saved him and all those other poor kids. Anyhow, I'm glad I'm already important to you. I don't like to think about it or talk about it. Why would you? I mean, what is there to talk about? That's what I love about pop music. I don't want people to have to think too hard. I just want them to feel good. Ever since it happened, I have the same dream every night. Tell me. In my dream, I'm speeding through a tunnel that doesn't seem to end. I'm late to meet someone at the other side. And every time I turn these wide bends in the road, I drive past a body, but I don't stop for it. Dead body? Not exactly, but... lifeless. After a while, I realize that they're these doubles of me, like clones, that I've tried to send down the tunnel in my place. But they never made it to the other side. They're never the same age. They're always laid out in different configurations. Makes sense. Does it? Sure. I mean, you almost died. So... now it's easy to imagine yourself dead at any age. I don't think that's what it's about, because... in my dream, I know that I will never die. What's at the end of the tunnel? I always wake up before I get there. But I'm so frightened, because... I'm going somewhere where no one can find me and no one knows my name. Wake up! What are you doing in here? You got to wake up. We have to call Mom and Dad. Where's the remote? A plane crashed into a building in New York. And playback. ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Oh, pretend and lie ♪ ♪ There is Smoke and fire ♪ ♪ You are the great desire ♪ ♪ I wish you'd disappear Now I've seen enough ♪ ♪ Of your dirty Lo-o-o-o-ove ♪ ♪ Yes, I have seen ♪ ♪ Enou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ough ♪ ♪ Of your dirty love Now I get you up ♪ ♪ I just want you gone ♪ ♪ I need to be alone You're dirty magic ♪ ♪ You've broken my heart ♪ ♪ With your black art ♪ - Cue the set? - Set. And playback. Haunted by the ephemeral image of her sister and manager's nocturnal encounter, wrestling feelings of betrayal and exclusion, Celeste's loss of innocence curiously mirrored that of the nation. From that day forth, the girls' paths diverged, and the two sisters were forcefully pushed towards opposing severities of their characters. One for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, and four we go. Cut. Good. In the year 2017, Celeste would be 31 years old, prisoner of a gaudy and unlivable present, which had reached an extreme of its cycle, and there was no imagining what new forms it, or she, may assume. Where are you going? For a smoke. She's with makeup. - Is she dressed? - Hair wanted her. Round tables start at 1:00. That's not on me. 40 minutes late. Hey, how's she look? Tired. You look beautiful. I think it's enough of a statement with the brows. I think we should stop fussing with them now. How we doing in here? 20 minutes. Good. Celeste, I need to speak with you before we start today. - What is it? - It's better in private. Toni doesn't care. What is it? There's, uh... There's been a shooting... they think it's terrorism... in a beach town called Brac in Croatia. - Do we know someone who got hurt? - No, no, no. Of course not. No, no, no. Don't worry. We don't have much information, but 14 people are dead, - and, uh, more are injured... - Hey. No one is gonna think we are insensitive for playing a gig halfway around the world. It's not that. Okay, well, who did it? Far as I know, nobody's claimed responsibility. - Uh... - Let me finish. - Okay. - The shooters were all wearing masks from our "Hologram" video. - What? - They came out in masks and started shooting people at a beach resort. We don't know if it was organized or just a one-off thing. How similar? That's as much as I know. You're gonna get a lot of questions about it today. I want you to be prepared. - Can we call off the press? - Probably not without calling off tonight too. Josie says it'd be bad to avoid it anyway. Okay. People are going to be on your side. We just got to face it head-on and, you know, be astute in our response. I'm making arrangements to hold a press conference downstairs at 4:00. - A press conference? - Yeah. - Are you kidding me? - It'll take five minutes. I called Josie, I told her I want her here with us to prepare a statement now. Has anyone heard from Albertine? My phone's dead. Albertine is in the restaurant having lunch. I'm taking you to see them right now. Is she mad at me? Why would she be mad at you? She's excited to be here. I pushed roundtables until after press assembly. That allows us time for a few more details to pour in. But the gist I have so far is, it might all be a coincidence. - What do you mean, a coincidence? - I don't know. They stopped at a costume store and picked up the first disguise or whatever you want to call it that they saw. But the article SRK sent over purports that the gunmen were exploiting your image and body of work as a symbol of moral corruption in the West or something lunatic. - Ah, great. - Given your history, I think we should try and view this as an opportunity to speak to some of your most important beliefs and positions. I don't know about that. In all likelihood, her history is the reason they decided to target her. Now, from the outset, you have to make it clear that the reason that you are not canceling tonight or any upcoming dates is because there isn't enough information yet to justify canceling. - Right. - Keep it focused on your outpour of love and mourning for the victims and victims of violence all over the world. Nobody would blame you, but don't say anything rash. I don't want anyone to misconstrue what you're really trying to say. - Everyone out there will feel for you. - Yeah. Just speak from the heart. I feel like I'm gonna throw up. No, it's just my meds. My spine feels like daggers. I'll get the masseuse to swing by straight after the show. - Hello. - I'm gonna greet everyone and get us set up and meet you back down here in an hour. - Are they in the restaurant? - Yeah, I'll call... There they are. Ah. There you are! Why didn't you guys come up to the green room? Hey, Mom. Hi, baby. Hey, Ellie. Oh, you look tired. Want to come up to my room and take a nap? - No, I'm really hungry. - Okay. She wouldn't eat anything I ordered for her down here. I don't blame you. I had room service for breakfast. It's awful. - No, it's not that. I get carsick. - She gets carsick. Ah. Okay. Well, did you have any fun at all? - I showed her around our hometown. - Hey. How are you? - Things are the same in our world. - It's good to see you, kiddo. How's Grandma and Grandpa? Grandma wants to change their tickets to tomorrow. Why? I mean, it's practically across the street from them. Okay, I'll call her. - How'd it go? - What? - The conference. - Oh. I know. Let's not talk about it now. What's wrong? None of your business. Grownup problems. Don't worry about it. Hey, baby, you want to get some lunch with me? Can I take Alby for a quick solo girls' lunch? Of course, but I need you back by 4:00 so we can get ready for the show. - All right. - She has to be back by 3:30. Thank you, Ellie. Can you stick around the hotel, please? I got to go upstairs... - I got to get out of here... - Fine! Take security. I don't need a babysitter. I'm gonna walk Alby down the street. Yeah, down the street. Please be back by 3:30. All right. You take a nap. I'll bring her back after lunch. - What do you want to eat? - Mm, I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? Of course you know. I hate talking to kids these days. They always say they "don't know" about everything. Are you depressed or what? No. Listen, I'm just teasing. I'm just trying to get you to relax around me. I am relaxed. I'm just uncomfortable because there are so many people looking at us. Listen, there's gonna be paparazzis outside 'cause everyone knows we're here. - You want to go out the back? - No. I'll just walk ahead of you. Celeste? Celeste! Hey, man, please don't follow me. What are your feelings on today's attack? Listen, I'm going to lunch. I'll be back in 45 minutes. You can take as many pictures of me as you want then, okay? Thank you. Jeez! - Hey, slow down. - I hate those people. Everybody hates those people. Don't even worry about it. You should've let them take a picture of you. - You look so beautiful today. - No, I don't. I haven't washed my hair, and I barely have any makeup on. You want me to give you some of mine? I woke up looking like a pterodactyl today. That's the thanks you get for giving the gift of life. No good deed goes unpunished. You know, the little babies, they just suck the lifeblood right out of you. Shut up. You look great, Mom. Thank Christ for that. Better off than some of these other girls I meet. - Like who? - Not telling. - Why? What's wrong with them? - Nothing, really. It's just, you know, when I flip through these magazines, I see these girls I know, and half the time, I've seen them naked in a dressing room or whatever, so I know where they have an ugly birthmark or where they got their tail cut off. - Who has a tail? - Don't look so excited. I'm not telling you. I mean, I wouldn't want someone to spread that kind of personal stuff around about me, you know? This place isn't bad. Well, it's nice to sit with somebody who doesn't have their face buried in a phone. Me and Ellie don't do phones at the table. That's cool. You should listen to her. I do listen to her. But if she's so cool, then why do you hate having her around? I don't hate having her around. I just wanted some alone time with you. You act like you hate her. That's an ugly thing to say. Don't say that. Not saying you actually hate her. Just saying you act like it. Look, sometimes I got a short fuse because I don't get a lot of sleep and I've got a lot of stuff on my plate. There's no money in music anymore. It's all branded content or virtual reality, reality TV. I mean, I do a voice for a video game character, for Christ sakes, and I make more money in an afternoon than I do all year on tour. Then why do you leave us and go on tour for so long? I got a lot of people to pay... more people than you can imagine. It's a full-time job. It's like I'm connected to the whole world all the time, and I can hear everyone in my head. I thought we were talking about Aunt Ellie. What do you want to talk about? - Is she okay? - She's upset you don't ever try and see her. She told you that? That really pisses me off that she's bringing our problems into my relationship with you. That has nothing to do with you. You got that? Nothing. What problems do you have with her? You have everything she ever wanted. That's ridiculous! - I'm serious. - Oh, God. When we went to visit Grandpa, he even showed us a video of Aunt Ellie singing and dancing when you guys were little. Hey, what can I say, you know? Your Aunt Ellie has too many scruples, and sometimes life just isn't that fair. Especially not nowadays. Now people will try and sell you anything... a TV monitor that plain as day looks like shit, but they tout it as "ultra mega triple hi-def" whatever. Their business model relies on their customer's unshakable stupidity. And deep down, we probably sense that... their intimate knowledge of our commitment to the lowest common denominator. It's the official manifestation of the increasingly important urge to break with every living thing that has some connection to the past. - What? - When we weren't paying attention, everyone got together and they voted that traditions of the past are ugly. The past reeks too much of ugly old people and death. So Mama's got to stay fresh. - Okay. - You know, I'm pretty sure that every year my videos keep getting worse and worse, but they're doing better and better. They showed me this perfume thing we shot last year where I'm unfurling from a digital rose petal like Thumbelina, and I thought it would ruin me, but here I am, opening for 30,000. Mom, what are you even talking about? I'm letting you in on a little secret because I love you, that's what. It doesn't matter anymore if you're Michelangelo or if you're Mikey and Angelo from New Brighton. And Aunt Ellie never found her angle. And then she decided to go get jealous of my good fortune. She made her own choices. And let me tell you, she could never do what I do day in and day out. But luckily, she gets to go home to you every night, and she doesn't have any real-world responsibilities 'cause I finance her entire life. - Quiet. - Don't tell me to be quiet. No, I don't mean it like that. Isn't that your song? Yeah, I'm sorry. I'll go ask them to turn it off. Excuse me. Would you mind turning off the music, please? I'm about to order lunch, I'm trying to talk to my kid. I just keep hearing my voice in the head. Yeah, sorry. My manager told me to put it on. Okay. Could you bring me a drink and maybe a soda for her? - What do you want? - Oh, a glass of white wine. Whatever you have that isn't gross. And if you could put it in a plastic cup or something. - Sure. - Okay. I'm sorry to rag on Aunt Ellie. I know she's doing her best. It's just, I'm having a shit day, and I'm taking it out on her. Better her than me. I never take it out on you. Okay. I don't, do I? Ah, God! Well, if I do, I don't mean to. I'm sor... I'm sorry. You know, sometimes you just... you think it can't get any worse, and then you just... you get diagnosed with fucking cancer. What? Mom, are you sick? I don't mean literally. I just... You know, sometimes you just get kicked while you're down. - Oh, God, I shouldn't do this in front of you. - It's fine. No, it's not. I would slap me across the face if I was sitting across from me right now. - Really, it's fine. - Dan left me. Yeah, I know. I read about it. You know? Aunt Ellie's not supposed to let you read that gossip shit. She can't control everything I do like a watchdog. You know what? I wanted to tell you. I keep feeling like big moments get stolen away from me. Mom, it's fine. I don't care about that guy. I thought you loved Dan. Yeah, he was fine. I was just nice to him because he was nice to you. Here we are. Do you guys know what you want to order yet? You know, we could use a couple more minutes with the menu. I'll just have the pasta with marinara. Do you want me to put that in, or do you want me to wait? That's okay. You can just bring her. I don't need anything. You just bring her pasta. Why did he leave you? - Who said he left me? - You did. Well, he didn't. We left each other. Because when you love something, you give it away. Is he seeing someone else? - Is that what you read? - Yeah. Said he started dating some rich girl. I don't know. That's not what he told me. But I bet it's just a fling. I mean, I've had flings I wouldn't want anyone to judge my character by. - Drinks okay? - Yeah, thanks. I'm the manager here, so if you need anything, let me know. Will do, thanks. Um, hey, do you mind if I get a quick picture with you? Now is not the best time. It's not for public use or anything. - It'll just take a minute. - Is this what you want a picture with? I'm trying to talk to my daughter. I'm sorry, you don't have to use that tone with me. I think I asked you very nicely. You don't have to be so upset. It's just a picture. - Are you fucking serious, man? - Please don't use that language. How dare you, motherfucker? Alison, can you call the police? Who the fuck do you think you are? I could ask you the same question. I can smell the alcohol on your breath, by the way. Are you trying to embarrass me in front of my daughter? I didn't even know you had a daughter. I just came up to be friendly, and you started yelling at me. Now I'm asking you to leave the restaurant, or I'm going to call the cops. Let's just go. You should be ashamed of yourself, prick. Oh, Jesus. You know what? Let's go down this way so we don't have to deal with all those shitheads out front. Look, I'm really sorry I lost my cool on that guy. He was asking for it, but I don't want to talk about it. Baby, you're all shook up. Look, that kind of thing doesn't happen all the time, but sometimes it does, and I got to protect myself. I said I don't want to talk about it. But baby, we got to talk about it, 'cause if we don't, it just hangs in the air. I'm worried about you. You're worried about me? You don't need to worry about me. I'm solid. I worry about you. Baby, that's my job... to worry about you. - You're skinnier than I am! - Oh, come on. That's 'cause I'm in great shape 'cause I go out dancing my ass off every night. Come on, baby. You're breaking my heart. Listen, what that guy said before about me having alcohol on my breath, that was a terrible thing to imply in front of you. And instead of just ignoring the elephant in the room, let's talk about it head-on. I ordered a glass of wine from them in a plastic cup 'cause I need to let go of some tension I'm having about tonight, and I didn't want you to think there was anything to worry about. But I swear on my life I had nothing to drink before that today, okay? It's nothing to worry about. In 2011, Celeste had drunk herself blind... or more precisely, blind in one eye. She'd waited to tell a physician about the trouble she'd been having, too embarrassed to explain that while touring the less inhabited, and therefore less inhibited parts of the southern United States, she had damaged the optic nerve in her left eye by ingesting various forms of methanol during a stint of binge-drinking household cleaning products across three state lines. Shortly thereafter, once back at home, she found herself at the center of a very public dispute as the result of a traffic collision and one unlucky pedestrian's crushed left leg and pelvis. Adding insult to injury, Celeste accosted the pedestrian in a string of uncharacteristic racial slurs. The victim of this short-lived episode in her life saw an opportunity and seized it. That golden ticket came in the form of a nearly 13-million-dollar settlement, all just another flame in the crowd of what Celeste perceived as a decade-long witch hunt. What is it, baby? Is something else on your mind? It's nothing. Stop it. What is it? Albertine had lost her virginity the weekend prior to leaving for this first unveiling of Celeste's 6th studio recording, Vox Lux, and yearned to share the galvanizing details with her mother. She had made herself sick with anticipation every day since or sense of failure it might inspire in Celeste, had always spoken severely of young men, even warning of them more than mixing uppers with downers, for example. If all went according to plan, the news might just strike up a long-misplaced maternal instinct, and Celeste would be forced to act as her confidant. That was fast. Where's Albertine? Oh, she's up in my room taking a pregnancy test, 'cause apparently you're so fucking incompetent you let her get fucked by some hick from town. - She's pregnant? - Unless she inherited my bad luck, probably not. But I wanted her to feel the unease of waiting for that result, because a parent, or a legal guardian, disciplines their kid, they don't just hang out. I'm sorry. I had no idea. You fucked up. Twice. - I know you're mad but... - How could I be so stupid? You know? You did so badly by me, why would I expect you to do right by her? I knew she was seeing a guy, but it... it didn't seem physical, I swear. You a retard? No. 'Cause sometimes your jaw slacks in a certain way, where you look like life's just happening to you. You look like a retard. Please don't say that about me. Only crazy people get aggravated when you call them crazy. So you must really be retarded. - I don't understand how you can hate me so much. - Oh, I hate you? Is that the kind of garbage you've been putting in her head? 'Cause she told me all the shit you've been putting on her shoulders. You ungrateful sow. I have a press conference and two hours of roundtables, but I swear to God, Ellie, if my daughter comes back to me pregnant with some cross-eyed Guido's kitten litter or Hepatitis Z, I will throw you off that balcony. After everything I've done for you both! After everything you've done for us? Good job. You've done it. Done what? You've hurt me. Embarrassed me. I have dedicated my whole life to "Celeste," and I'll continue to do so, but if you threaten me ever again, I'll remind the world that I raised her child and that I write her songs. Touché. but today, that's a stock I wouldn't buy into. You can say whatever you'd want. In this day and age, who'd care? In this meditation, we're going to play with the idea of motivation. - Work can sometimes feel a bit flat. - Celeste? Hey, Is she awake? Celeste? Thank you. Hey. Hello again. Have a great show. Have a great show. How are we doing in here? How we doing? Can you believe it? Hmm? What's that? Everyone we used to answer to works for us now. Josie... She cares about you. You used to call her a bitch. - You look amazing. - What? Keep it simple. You're gonna do great. Celeste, I just want to quickly introduce you to Yanmei, our opener tonight, before she heads out - to Staten Island for sound check. - Welcome. We are so glad to have you. To share a stage with you, to me, is an incredible honor and truly a dream come true. That's real nice of you to say, but, really, the pleasure's mine. They showed me your stuff, and I said, "We got to get that girl." Then I am even more touched by your invitation. We won't keep you. She has a rehearsal at the venue. Hope you dig my hometown. Excuse me? Have fun in Staten Island. I have an outpouring of love for victims of today's unthinkable event and for victims of violence everywhere, and I am deeply saddened to be associated with such an obscene and unnecessary tragedy. It's-It's a weird world we live in, and I guess, no matter how much you try to ignore all these things that are really happening, sometimes they just find a way to creep in. Jennifer Durst, WYNN New York. Why do you think they chose you? Do you assume there's some connection to New Brighton? I don't know, I mean, I know about as much as you right now, and, um... you know, since no one's coming forward and saying, "Hey, we did this," I'd prefer not to speculate. But if they did choose this disguise on purpose, I-I guess that it's because they don't like that I'm a woman or maybe they don't like that I'm a successful woman. Maybe they don't like that I had a kid when I was a kid. Maybe they think I'm a floozy. But maybe you guys think that too. I mean, the way I've chosen to live my life goes against some people's views about things. Are there any links between you and Central Europe? Not really. Not that I know of. I've never played a show there, so I don't really know. - Next question. - I just have one more. Are you and the band still going forward with the show tonight? Well, there's not really enough information yet to justify canceling. and my dad always says, "Never postpone joy," so, yeah, I'll play if they let me. Next question. There, at the back. Afternoon, Meredith Desh, covering Greater Northeast. to the perpetrators of today's attack? Yeah. I'd like to tell them that when I was a little girl, I used to believe in God too. And if they ever come to their senses, and they want something new to believe in, they can believe in me. 'Cause I'm the new faith, and I'm not afraid of them. Hell, I'd even like to extend an invite to my show tonight. Josie, can you make sure to put "cowards in masks" on the guest list. I'm sorry, but can you explain what you mean exactly? Celeste had been led here by example, making loose proclamations akin to those made en vogue by the government officials and public representatives of her era. She was frightened and wanted to hide, but before leaving the stage, she would tangentially exclaim, "I got more number-one hits than an AK-47's standard 30-round magazine." I don't know. I was just making... a quip. Do you actually believe the weird shit you said up there? They wanted a show, I gave 'em a show. All right, this place is swarming with press. Can I kindly ask you both to keep your mouths shut until we're finished? - Fine by me. - Let me handle it. Go smoke a cigarette or something. Hello, everybody. Hello. You have ten minutes. As we currently have no new information concerning what's happening across the Atlantic, I'd ask you to keep your questions to tonight's performance and the new album as much as possible. Okay. Thank you. Um, well, on that note, can you tell us what audiences can expect from the new album? - Sci-fi anthems. - Hmm. The concept with this one was to create an experience as relentless and addictive as possible. Fantastic. Um, so... I know we were just asked not talk about today's attack, but, um, I can't help but let it - contextualize my next question. - Okay. Okay. Uh, you know, it just got me thinking, do you feel that there has been a shift in the culture where nihilist radical groups like this are increasingly keen on being perceived as superstars themselves? I mean, who cares? I was hesitant to even make a statement today, because all these ultra-violent thugs want is to make headlines. I mean, if everyone stopped paying attention to them, they'd cease to exist. So would people like me, I guess, But that's the only link I can really think of between me and them. I couldn't just ignore the casualties, though. It makes me sick. Okay. I guess, uh, from the public's perspective, this has been a, I guess, emotional few years for you, bizarre events today very much included. Can you shed any light on the significance of these upcoming arena performances for you personally? You're kicking things off in your hometown. This is a culmination of my life's work so far. You know, we worked on it for two years before bringing it to the public. Why two years? Well, the year before that, I was under a lot of stress after my accident. And it's an expensive show to put on. I wanted to make sure all the best people became available. I wanted all my best dancers back. With the decision to kick things off in New Brighton. you must have considered the event like a homecoming resurgence since the accident and the arrest - for, uh, causing serious injury by dangerous driving? - "Injury," not "serious injury." And I never stopped making music, so I don't consider it a resurgence. I just wanted a place to channel all that anxiety and suffering into something tangible, something positive. Mm-hmm. Then can you shed any light on why that case was abruptly dropped? I see what you're doing. Well, you brought it up. I'm not going to say "abruptly" anything, okay? Listen, there are three classifications of gunshot wounds to the spine. I'm type three, which means that the bullet is lodged in my inter-vertebral disc space. Now, type-three injuries are further subdivided into, (a) spinal injury without perforation of abdominal viscera; (and b) spinal lesions with perforation of abdominal organs. Now, thankfully, I'm type A, but it's no secret that I'm on meds for my injury, and I never should've been behind the wheel of a car that night. - Josie? - I didn't mean to upset you by that. I used to be treated like I was a hero, and then they start talking about me like I'm trailer trash. But that's what this show is about. - It's about rebirth. - Time's up! And have you at all been in contact with the victim? You know I can't talk about that. I thought we were talking about it just now, am I wrong? Do you not think it's an insensitive time to be bringing this up? - Oh, come on. - You and I, Tony, we are through. - You know what? You should... - I'm doing my job, Josie. That's it. ...write about those innocent people instead of trying to tear down a good person and an artist. That's not what I'm trying to do. I'm sorry that you misunderstood. I'm standing everything down until after the show. I want you to go to your room and get some rest. Some rest, okay? - Okay. - I'm serious. What floor are you on? One floor up. Uh, room 910. Do you have my key? - No. - Ah, fuck. Get your hands off her. I came up here, she was crying by herself. She needed a hug. Go downstairs, get ready for the show. Come on. Don't do that. Look, I hope you didn't take that thing I gave you earlier. I overreacted. What you want me do, you want me to scream it from the rooftops? I'm not ready for you to grow up. Okay? You're my little girl. You forgive me? Okay, uh... Give these to Aunt Ellie. - What's this for? - It's for everything. Take them down, I'll meet you guys in the lobby, and, uh, we'll head over together, all right? Baby, I love you. You too. - So why aren't you downstairs? - Ah, Jesus Christ! I almost forgot you were there. What happened? Josie called off the rest of the day. - What? - Yeah, some guy came after me about Joel Hedlund. I didn't have the mental capacity or the balls to take him on. Oh, good. I'll go talk her off a roof. No, please. Please, please, stay here. What was she saying to you just now? Hmm? Nothing, really. Oh, come on. You're my best spy. She doesn't talk to me. I don't know. She's got this, uh, mock trial thing at school. They got invited to a competition in Lake Tahoe, - so she must be pretty good at it. - Okay. Well, that explains the Perry Mason routine. I got cross-examined over lunch. Did she mention anything else of note? Asked if I could arrange for her to see it. All right. Okay. Not what I was expecting you to say. How'd you respond? I told her, you know, he's a messed-up guy with problems. It was probably a bad idea. Good. Good. You got any of that stuff left over from last night? Is that a good idea right now? I'm done yammering for the day. Come on. Tonight's second nature. Got to get out of my head. You know that. I'm getting myself all worked up from over-thinking everything. I keep picturing all those people screaming and running all over the sand. Look, we'll just do what we have left. We won't call for more until after the show. You can fuck me for a little while we're high. I'm scared. Nothing to be scared about, kiddo. Nothing. Celeste, come on. Everybody's downstairs. - Stop the car. - No, no, no, no. No. We're running late. - Just pull over for two minutes. - What is it? I just... I just need to do something for two minutes. Will you stop the fucking car, please? Stop the car! Come on! Get down with me. What are you doing? Let's just have a moment of silence together. Let's shut our eyes and hold everyone who's suffering right now in our hearts. Can I help you, miss? - Nobody calls me that. - Give her some space. I got you. - You got her? - Yeah. - Are there cameras down there? - Not that I know of. - Tell your team if anyone is caught photographing her... - No photos! - ...they are fucking fired! - We'll fire their fucking asses. What can we get you? Mmm... I'm very thirsty. Get her some water and something to eat. - Okay, what would she like? - Uh, anything with sugar. - Soda. - Where's Albertine? - She's behind you. - Will you take her and get her something to drink? We're not going anywhere. I'm right here. Oh, I was just coming up to introduce myself. - I'm stepping in for O'Malley tonight. - Who's O'Malley? - Now is not a great time. - Oh, I'm sorry. I can come by your dressing room later. I need you to call this! She can't go on. Celeste, stop with the histrionics. - Yeah, I know. I know. - Okay? Get it together. I know. We've been here every day for a week. Let go of me! Let go of me! Everyone thinks I'm some kind of idiot! - No one thinks you're an idiot. - Just shut up! - Stop being a spoiled brat. - Don't call me a brat. - Stop being a spoiled fucking brat. - Don't call me a fucking brat! You shut up. Shut up and stop being a spoiled brat. - Right this way, guys. - Thank you. - Spoiled brat. - Don't you ever fucking call me a spoiled brat! Don't you ever! I am sick of everybody treating me like I'm not a person! Get it together. Get your shit together. Do not come in here and indulge this unhealthy behavior, Ellie! Close your eyes. - Get out of here. - Can you hear me? Can you hear me? I said, get out! Close your eyes and pretend - you're the only one in the room. - Hey. Hey. Hey. Do you want me to call this off? You're dancing in your room. What did you say? Move. Everybody's is talking about me like I'm not right in front of them. I'm right in front of them... He's a car salesman. Don't worry about him. Hey. They showed me these promos we shot today. I looked so bad. - What are you talking about? - So bad! No, don't look at me like that. - Listen to me. - Okay. Listen to me. So they told me the camera we were using was gonna be great. I looked so ugly. I looked so ugly! And it made me want to die! No. You're not gonna die. I just want to be queen for them, and sometimes I don't feel like a queen at all. Sometimes... I'm just so ugly underneath all this. If they only knew. I'm so grateful you're alive. I'm here. They can be so mean! So mean! That's because they've never done anything they're proud of, honey. Right! You're right! You're not here for them. You're here for your fans. And tonight will be the greatest night of their lives. The public will be at your feet again. In just a few minutes, this nightmare you've been living will all be over, and it will have all been worth it. Let me help you get dressed. Two minutes. Two minutes, guys! - All right, two-minute warning! - Watch your step, miss. Coming through! Clear those cables. They're coming in. Excuse me. Coming through. - Excuse me. - Excuse us. Watch your step here. - Stage team, take your places. - Excuse us. - Places, please. - Clear. Clear out of the way. Thank you. - Quick, over here. - You look amazing. Are you ready? My daughter's out there tonight. Got to make this amazing for her. All right. Let's get started. All right, everybody gather round Cel. Okay, I just want to say thank you for this beautiful group of talented people. I want to take a minute to reflect on the last year and this crew, who are like family. None of this would be possible without you. Then let's give our girl some love! - Who's the baddest bitch in the room? - You are! - Who's the sickest band on the planet? - We are! - Who makes this possible? - We do! - Are we gonna be good? - No! - Are we gonna be great? - No! - Are we gonna be amazing? - No! Then what are we gonna be? - Phenomenal! - Yeah! Phenomenal! Phenomenal! Phenomenal! Phenomenal! Phenomenal! Come on! Take it higher and higher and higher and higher and higher and higher and higher! Phenomenal, break! Five, four, three, two... Tonight, we're gonna bring it back to where it all began. You want to travel back in time with me? Tonight is all for you. That's right, bitches.

She recounted a story to Eleanor that went something like this: Shortly after her classmate pulled the trigger and sent her to the place between life and death, a place that she was only able to describe to Eleanor as a rush of color, She had met the devil and made a deal with him in exchange for her life. He whispered her melodies, and she returned with a mission to bring great change to the next century. He said, "Shut your eyes and repeat after me: One for the money, two for the show.
