In February 1915, the Turkish army began a crackdown on the Armenian people. Sometime later ... thousands of survivors of this genocide came to France. To survive and integrate ... most Armenians chose hard work and sacrifices. Some did not. The Malakian clan was one of those. INSIDE RING - Want something? - No. Be quick. Sorry. Take it easy! - Let's talk politely. - Politely? Are you kidding? Come on, get your documents. Get your things and get out there! As police you face danger every day. Mortal danger. Some people don't respect human life. Starting with you. Carrying a weapon means being prepared to kill ... but also to die. You will face situations that may be classified into 4 categories. Colours. First we have White. Total absence of danger. I need not dwell here. For cops, it rarely happens. Yellow: awareness of the environment. You are walking calmly but anything can happen. Orange: possible danger. Demonstrations control routines ... all senses are on alert ... in order to anticipate action. Finally, red. Red is real threat. An armed individual is facing you. At this precise moment ... a cop who is not psychologically prepared to use his weapon ... is a danger both to himself and to those whom he should protect. So ask yourselves these questions: "Am I am prepared to risk my life ?"... "Am I prepared to kill?" Good morning. Lift the leg a little, push the heel ... - And lift the toes. - I can't. I'll help. That 'hurts. But you must try. Or you'll never walk normally again. Don't worry. I'm right here - Mom. Do what the doctor says. So doctor, any progress? Not a doctor. I'm just a nurse. I only care about the results. And my mother is better. Hi How are you today? Ooh, your hand's cold! Eaten anything yet? Go to the kitchen. Yeva will prepare something. Fine, but stop smoking. Anton! Can you come here? Here. Your share for the car job. That's all? Yeah, and stop with the cars. What will I do for money? You are talking pocket-money. We have something better lined up. Tuesday, at 11 h. Come with Rudy. Your uncle will tell you where to find us. What kind of job is it? What we do. Don't worry. Check the girl. Who are you? I know him. I'm sorry. - Okay. - Just a minute. - Why did you come here? - Why don't you answer when I call? Wait downstairs. I'll be done in an hour. ?lodie, what's the problem? It's been 2 days that I've tried to talk to you. Sorry, but I've been very busy. I'm exhausted. Will this work stop. - Really? And how am I supposed to live? - I have money. Gotta go. I'll Be late. I know you don't see it ... ... but things will change. Trust me. I'm not joking with you, ?lodie. Come. - Anton, we're late! - It'll take time. - Daniel called. They are waiting for us. - Don't worry. Listen. You'll open this safe, if you don't want anything to happen to your family. Stop! Stop right there! Where could he have gone? - You could have spared him ... - Shut up! The vehicles were found in parking lot of a supermarket. Of course there are fingerprints. Who needs fingerprints? We know who it was. Pretty, isn't it? It is. - You like it? - Very much. Soon it will be ours. What? We'll open a hotel, just a few rooms. Look over there. It will be for the horses. I'll take care of them. - You mean horses? - I will learn! Come here. Do not be afraid. See. Give me your hand. Do not be afraid. Open your palm. Slowly, slowly ... I want to live here. But only if you're with me. Alone, I'm not interested. Come with us. They're throwing a party. - You go on. I'll follow later. - Come! How are you? Okay, how about you? I won't stay. It's getting late. I have not seen you lately, but wanted to tell you one thing. You're my son, Anton. One day, you know, you'll take over the business. Your decisions may be good or bad ... ... but never let anyone question them. If they see you hesitate, find that you are weak. Then one of them will try to take your place. What did you do that night can't happen again. Never. Enjoy the evening. Anton! I was with your father. Sit down. I know. - What did you talk about? - Everything and nothing. Business. Did you mention the ranch? What would you like me to tell you? The property is not your father's thing . 50 thousand. With that I can set aside a portion or two, not more. I don't care. This must remain 50-50. - I don't want anyone else involved. - Sure, but I need a little more. Get out! She is with me! That goes for you too! Help me to prevent the sale. I'll get the rest. Why mess with that place? There are others. I want that one. Okay. To business! Come on, to health! Stop. Stop drinking! What is this? I'm fine! You're being a pain! Sir, can't stay here. - Who are you? - I'm the owner. Get out. We're having fun. I'm fine! It's bothering the customers. Learn to drink or stay home! We finished drinking so let's go. - No, leave now! - Easy! - The club is mine! - Fuck! Don't give us orders! I do what I want here. Know who we are? Of course I know. Some street slut's kids. Leave! Go! Go! Ready ... Let's start over. Then, they were not celebrating the robbery? We know you didn't hit the owner of the club. Not hungry? You're a nice guy. Don't eat or drink, don't talk. It's quiet. You won't bother anyone in prison. The guards will worship you! Let's go to the next room. It is quieter. - Coffee? - No, thanks. Nobody hit me. I fell. A nightclub is dark. I tripped and hit my head on a table. That's it. Are you kidding? Chief, we have a problem. The guy is changing his statement Hey, what? What? What did you threaten to do? Kill his family? Burn his club down? You may have changed your region, Malakian, but you haven't changed your methods. The Marigny mansion ... was you. A man was killed there. Wherever you go, there are deaths. That's going to stop. Next time, you'll need do more than intimidate... - A nightclub owner to get your way. - And you are threatening me with what? October 16, 2003. I was at the shopping centre during the shooting. I was only a lieutenant at the time. You lost a son there. I lost a friend. - It's all we have in common. - Goodbye, sir. - Where is Anton? - I don't know. Where does he go when he's not home? I don't know, Milo. Your son doesn't tell me everything. - Maybe with a girl. - A girl? What girl? Anton knows several girls. This mass is dedicated ... to the memory of Georgy Malakian. Georgy was a boy ... who left us too soon ... cut down by violence the world had chosen. May his soul rest in peace and the souls of all those who loved him. Okay? You don't look good. No, I'm fine. ?lodie, I feel that there's something wrong. Is it your mysterious Armenian ? Won't you tell me? - At least tell me what he does. - I don't know. His name is also a secret? Anton. His name is Anton. Thank you. I'll stop by to pick you up at 18 h. Anton! Romeo! Check this. Remember poker at Zakar's house? I took the shirt of his back. He said that he was bankrupt then emptied his shop. Here. - It's Italian. The best. - I can't wear this. It's kid. Kid! Look! - I have one. They're the best! - We can't go out with the same shoes. Then choose another. Rudy ... need to talk to you. About an old project. - What kind? - A hotel in Camargue. A legal business. It's in progress. Want to invest? - Milo knows? - No. Wait, Anton. Why do you want to work? The job at the mansion went well. We can't do things without your father knowledge. You know how it works. I know. How much do you need? 30 thousand ... 40 thousand? BAKERY - CONFECTIONERY See. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - What do you want? - This. Okay. - Let's hold hands. - I did not. - This. - Come on. Bollocks! Take care! Those plants have thorns! Ruben, come on. Anton, how are you? Wait! What's this? In order be ready next summer, we must start now. What is this? We had a deal! You talk about money, but I only get promises. I need to see the colour of it. For now, I'm paying on account, but it'll not go far. There are people with much money willing to invest. I'll get the money. Don't you trust me? When? Give me a month. - Why not do it with ... - My father? No chance. Let him out of it. A month. Okay. Not a day more. It's always the same thing. They want results, but we take our men. The ministry wants to put an end to slot machines. As of today, this is the priority. Put your men onto it. - And Malakian? - Forget him for now. Why? It's been a problem, and we've been making good progress. Progress? You haven't brought any evidence before the judge ... - We can! - There's been nothing concrete in this matter! Use informants. Work. We won't get anywhere doing that. Nobody dares to rat on Malakian. I'm confused, Saunier. In Paris, you had good grades. What are you doing here? I know your record. Don' make Malakian a personal matter. There is nothing worse for a cop than a lack of objectivity. - They committed murder. - I know. I know. Did you have a good trip? We took it easy - Okay, Milo? - Well, Frank, fine. Every year, with casinos, hotels, shops ... lots of money changes hands on the Riviera. During the loading and transport, safety is priority. But when the money is inside the plane ... ... mission complete: the cops go away. Therefore, during the minutes between loading and takeoff ... ... the aircraft is unattended. That's where we come in. How many men does it take? Ten at the most. You want to know your share, right? Well, doesn't everyone? 5 million. For each one of you. Minimum. Interested, Anton? Frank? It's tempting, Milo, but risky. We need to know a little more. I'll show you. The entrance to the airport is here. The traansport arrives here. The plane is parked here. Once the passengers have boarded, they remove the ladder. Rudy ... How long has he been with this girl? What girl? I'm not stupid. The nurse. How long you been with her? - I don't know, Milo. - Since she started coming here? I do not know. We want to bring a bit of money. Sure. - How much? - Between 600 and 800 thousand. I need to organize. It's more than usual. Thus your percentage drops to 7. You know I get 12 because the operation is risky. - That's expensive money. - But the money is clean. I guarantee it. Okay, good. Anton ... will he participate? - Why ask? - Nothing much. Yes Tell me. We have a small business together. A business? Yes. What type of business? It's nothing. I like Anton. He is your son. - Ms. Leconte? - Yes Why? Inspector Saunier. I chose to come here instead of summoning you. I wanted to talk to you. May I come in? Here. It's for you. - What is it? - Open. What should I do? Choose one? Is it a gift from the police? I didn't come here to meddle in your private life. I'm in an investigation ... and my duty is to inform you of the Malakian family activities. Malakian clan. Who is that? The doorman of a mansion that was robbed a few days ago. - What do I have to do with it? - Nothing, directly. But Anton Malakian participated with those who robbed the mansion ... and the murder of this man. - He would never do that. - Maybe. But it is a dead end. Sooner or later he will come to an end. To find what? Prison? Or probably the same as happened to his brother. I need your help, miss. We can still avoid it. But only you can help. Here. This is my card. If you know something, call me. What can I do for you, Milo? - I need equipment. - I'm listening. A team of 10 men. Rifles, flak jackets bullets and grenades. And also an ML 83. What will you do with all this? Abdeslam Halami, 71 years, retired. He left France 10 years ago and returned to Lebanon, his homeland. We know that he has continued his arms business there. His cover for his importing and exporting for the Mediterranean region. Mainly dates and exotic fruits. He's been only interrogated once. So what? He convinced the judge that the Syrians established the company to bring French arms ... ... to Beirut. Okay. Those photos of that meeting Malakian and ... Identified all of the faces? It's kind of complicated. Some I don't recognise. In any case, is certain that somebody is arming him. This guy ... - We want him to be watched. - Okay, but how? Now we are only two. So? Seven minutes. If we take the road, as planned ... they can set up a roadblock. If we use boats, they can't stop us. We found the creek where we'll start ... two cars that wait for us and then head north in two cars. In 7 minutes, will be 50 km ahead of the cops. Your idea is good, son. It will be a nice coup, and us together. You have what it takes. Men will listen to you. Anton ... What's between you and this girl? The nurse? I know that you've been seeing her for a while now. What does she know about us? Nothing. Think I chatter like woman? Talk in my sleep? Pay attention. With that girl around our necks, we can't afford mistakes. We are a family. She's different. She can not understand us. On the contrary ... ... she can betray us. This girl ... you have to finish with her. Do you understand? Yes, I understand. Let's go. Ready. Good. I'll send Coutard to replace you. Mirelli, you hear me? - I'm listening. - My way. What is he doing? Who is this, Milo? A cop. A cop bastard. Get out, Mirella! Get out! Okay, Saunier. You're back on the case. He was here last night? Stop, Miss. The road is closed. Walk! There is no reason to quit. They can't know what we are preparing. The next transfer is in 3 weeks. We have to stay hidden. It is difficult for all of us ... for our families ... ... but do not forget who you are. And we're all here meeting. We are of the same family ... ... we share the same roots. What about the boats? It's all right. Meanwhile, be discreet. No more confusion. Our families are safe. We'll.. ... hole-up here, until it's time. It's me. Climb on. I don't want this life. You're gone without saying anything, aren't you talking to me? You don't say anything about your your family, hear. Is your brother died, then? Who told you that? Was it Rudy? Tell me, who told you that? Cops. They came to my house to tell me of your life. I'm pregnant. See you Tuesday at my office, right? I'll be waiting. Goodbye. Do not make that face. We had an agreement, but I couldn't wait. I'll have the money here, it a question of a few days! Anton, we are friends. Maybe it was the business right for you. You did not trust me. I gave you my word! I'm sorry. Who did you sign up? It's confidential. It's business. Sorry. Tell me, come on! Tell me! Tell me that you made a deal with my father! The deal was between me and you! Nobody else! Nobody! What is wrong with you? The deal is still in the family. I or you, what difference does it make? - Everything. - If you miss a beat... ... lose the proximity, it creates danger. You talk of cool? The cop on the quay, the shooting ... ... what was that about? He participated in the murder of your brother. And what you did, will it bring him back to life? You don't understand. The problem is this girl. Pay attention. For me, it's all over. I'll leave you with your ghosts. Let's take that too. Bordighera, Italy Have a nice day, miss. Thank you. Goodbye. Hi, beautiful! Hi, Rudy! It's beautiful here. With the old folk. Being bored. Paid to you as soon as possible. That is why we should get back to work. It's for next week. - Everything is ready. - Enough, Rudy! You are being cruel. Think about it ... ... his father has lost a son. - You can't do that to him. - Stay out of it. He is suffering. I hate to see it that way. Good morning, Milo. Sit down, Rudy. He won't return, Milo. I won'tt ask where he is. I swore to Anton. I know you keep your word. Because you only have one word. Because you are strong. That's why you work for me, right? Yes This girl ... ... she needs to disappear. Milo, you know ... Anton is my friend. I can't do that. Then ... what can you do for me? Why don't you think of other possibilities. Here are all the transports for next month. Both regular and irregular. - Something from the wiretap? - Nothing yet. Good .. Check the values of transports for banks, list them by size. - Did you see Rudy today? - No. His car just passed. Really? I'm going to the pharmacy. Do you need anything? Pharmacy? I'm fine. It's okay. Terrific. Later. Rudy! No! You don't understand. I'll never be what you want. Never! Let us be united for what has to be done. And then you leave me alone. Or break with me now. What you'll gain today ... ... will last forever. Then you can do whatever you want. They're behind us, 20 m away. What a geek! Boarding has begun. They have just arrived. Loading now. Good morning, gentlemen! I am responsible for security. Can I take them to the control tower. - Come on. - Follow me. Saunier is here. at the terminal. What do we do? Let's continue. "NOW" Hello? I need a taxi, please. These cameras cover area outside? Yes. We are beside the sea. We look for birds before each takeoff. They are leaving. Start the car. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. The plane is starting to taxi ... - Where are they? - Who? Officers! Where are they? They leave the runway for takeoff. It's safer. Give me the walkie-talkie. It Saunier. Back immediately. Our part is over. Back now. Do not leave until the plane has taken off! Is that clear? The cops! Officers! They returned Prepare. Lock us down! Fast! Smoke! Fast! Mischa! Call someone. Do passengers get out. Spread the men out! Don't shoot! Passengers on the runway! Stand up, lady. Protect yourself. No one shoots until I tell you! Get everyone here! Coutard! Call someone! Block their exit! Charly, come with me! Cover me! Don't stand there! Go to the car! Do what I say! Anton ... Fast! Help him! Hurry! Fast! Come! Climb on! Come! Come! Hold on, Anton. Hear me? Hold on. ?lodie ... she's waiting for me on the beach ... Lead Me, Father ... Anton ... Good morning, miss. You have a visitor. Your father . My father?
