Stop there please I strongly reject your suggestion that we are radical right wing We identify ourselves as German, yes... And we are proud of that Our aim is to unite all nationalistic forces in this country But by what means, that's the question Certainly not with bombs We're not people who throw bombs Those are anarchists and fanatics We wouldn't throw bombs at our own people We totally reject that behaviour Is the new right growing again? Of course If I understand, you want to get into parliament Do you think you have a chance? Yes I'm very certain Then would you explain to me... And to our viewers... Your political position First of all I'm just a simple family man I've a wife, two children and a dog And, don't laugh, three parakeets And that's my political position. Our goals are based on happy families They are the basis of a nation Only a fool could be satisfied with the present situation Society is falling apart The situation can only be improved with the help of our people... with high moral standards We are the dawning... of a new future And now our party chairman, Dr Norbert Fürst, will say a few words I'm a man of the war generation I didn't chose my time and place of birth I was born a German I'm not ashamed of that I openly claim to be a proud German patriot Friends. After we lost the war in such a sad way, The trend of propaganda took a leftward turn for 40 years To socialism and ”coca cola freedom" But now the tide is turning in our direction Back to basic values, to our ideals We will fight that leftist madness wherever we see its ugly face We won't tolerate queers, criminals and communists No! We will destroy them Look over there, it's Thomas What about that, eh? I didn't think he had the balls What's this garbage? Watch it.

He's gone nuts again Ladies and gentlemen... we are gathered here in front of a monument... dedicated to the victims of fascism it's to remind us, so fascism will never rise again Afternoon... So, another statue... Propagandist lies Maria Fischer, born December 12, 1903... Arrested by the Gestapo, April 29, 1941 Beheaded on March 30, 1943 This is a letter to her condemned husband "My dear and only Rudi.. I'm always with you. I still have so much to tell you So much to give you You and Erika meant everything The two of you were and still are the best things in my life And she wrote to her daughter Erika My dearest Erika, it's over I'm sorry you cried when you heard the verdict Our days are numbered I don't want to make them more difficult than they are It matters not if we live a few days more or less I followed my husband so far and I will follow him still Be brave and strong. Hugs and kisses... You mother Comrades, let's welcome our great idol A man beyond compare Long live the hero of the fatherland! Captain Hermann To lose our spirit is to abandon our cause The German people look up to you They love you You are and remain our greatest national hero Your great achievement was and is... the fact that you held the eastern front You defended it so that our people may live in peace today, even those who today are against us Captain Hermann, you are above all weakness Above heaven and hell Long live our holy fatherland Long live an eternal and free Europe Long live the immortal hero of the German peoples... Captain Hermann Ladies and gentlemen... Beloved friends... To start our election campaign I want to assure you... that my party- - will continue to fight for a free and united Fatherland It is our goal... to protect its spiritual and cultural unity... and preserve its biological essence This can only be achieved... by getting elected to parliament And to become once again... the inheritors of our great German Fatherland We risk losing our jobs... possibly our health and our lives because of our convictions But today when political opponents claim we murdered Jews... we must show this is nothing but a filthy lie! You pigs, you damned pigs!... Nazi's out! Nazi's out! Out of the question. I can't turn off the speakers Ladies and gentlemen... I can be certain... I've done a lot of research on the subject... which confirms... that everything they told us about Auschwitz... and other concentration camps... is a lie Fake news Nobody was ever gassed in Auschwitz Every nation has this problem... of the wandering Jew who refuses to integrate Every patriot who loves his country must oppose this Jewish element So we ask, what should be done with the Jews? Hitler had an ingenious solution He knew the Jewish elements could not be contained here He built them golden bridges so they could emigrate... with all their possessions Hitler ordered Eichmann to encourage Zionism How can Eichmann be a mass killer of Jewish people? He was the man who helped the Jews find new roots But... outside Europe! The one with the long hair The one with the glasses And that one Now over here For us it was a great victory... We'll keep marching on... when everything's turned to dust. Sieg heil! Today Germany belongs to us... tomorrow the whole world. Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Why did you join the party? There's loyalty and pride among the members That's what I've been looking for in my life That's why I'm here What the difference between friendship... in school and in the party? School's totally different In school it's everyone for them self, only the strong prevail I mean... There is no true friendship But here it's all for one, no-one thinks just of them self Do you have any specific ideals? Yes, many things, for example... for racial purity No foreign labor We have so many kids out of work already Among the patriotic youth movement I feel sheltered There's romance, camp fires, and I feel at home I think it's great. It really suits me What in particular? Well, the party and the nationalist cause I'm definitely a traditional monarchist... so feel strongly drawn to right wing ideals I want to serve the German cause I'm proud to belong to the German race I like it... Is this a press conference? You're disturbing the peace I can't guarantee your safety We'll get him later Come along, something's happening A beer... Fritz, give me a beer please Thomas stay with the car Don't let anybody out Let's go You Nazi pigs! Attention! Comrades... What's wrong with you lot? You can't just go round beating people up And in uniform, so everyone recognizes you And why not? Because you need the permission of the party leaders That's why So we let these leftist rats beat us up and don't right back? Have you heard of party discipline, Günther? Yes, so we have to fill in forms and have them stamped Please understand... we have to get into parliament - So what? - What? This behaviour damages the party I don't want any more of this kind of thing What the fuck are we supposed to do? Just put up with it? Listen carefully If you trim a tree you just strengthen its roots Right - Nobody circumcises me - Well said You can't just do what you feel like Oh yes we can Come along guys - Let's not argue - Indeed We are the chosen few - Robert? - Yes, what is it? - Are you with friends? - We came for a drink Come into my study Now he'll show you something A lampshade... made in Germany Good evening Come, let me show you a real rarity Made of guaranteed Jewish hide Where's it from? From Auschwitz Whose skin was it? I've never found out Come closer, it won't bite Look at the number, these blue figures... That's the numbers used in the concentration camps Sadly the last two digits are illegible That's why I couldn't find out who it was I tried everything, but in vain Every day thousands of Jews were gassed in Auschwitz I don't believe that What? I thought the Nazi's didn't gas any Jews Among friends we speak the truth I bet this was a woman Such smooth skin Or a child? It could have been a child A shame it's not my math teacher As you've probably noticed yourself, Feigl... Nobody in the class knows as little as you That settles your final grades Not good enough The test is over Am I... too harsh on you? Or perhaps... only the strong prevail... as you stated on TV recently I think it's easy to let someone fail a test You know this is my weakest subject You could fail the whole class with those methods So you really think I'm being unfair? - Yes I do - Alright... In that case we'll let the class decide whether to fail you or not Face the blackboard please Closer please So, ladies and gentlemen... will those in favour of better grades raise their hands? Thank you Any opposing votes are not necessary Now you may turn round No-one Absolutely no-one voted for you As you can see, your tv appearances... do not impress your classmates Bye bye, fascist! This will have consequences, Feigl - Sit down - Don't you dare touch me! No Then he simply left the class? Yes... Thank you Goodbye What is it now? Can't we even eat in peace? What is it? You really want to know? Your son is a member of a radical right wing party He declares it on TV, screams at his teacher... and put some kid in hospital Other than that, everything is fine But I made a glorious exit Thomas! What's this all about? Nothing. I just don't go to school anymore So you made that decision Without asking us You really think so? When did you get interested in politics? And this shit party? They are good people When did you join? I'm not a member. I'm in the youth group Why didn't you ever tell us about this? Why? Answer me. Talk to me What about your education? What's going to happen to you? Yes, what about that? That's none of your business Can we at least talk about this? Not with your sort Don't do that again My God Why won't you talk to us? What do we ever talk about here? Charly, let me show you something - See this? - What is it? It's the emblem of our Special Youth Protection Unit What unit? If I show you something now, can you keep it a secret? - Of course - You'll love this Come on, tell me We're not going to be just talking, we're an active fighting force The party needs us... Have a look at that You see now why I didn't want Thomas around? There's enough here for an army That's the idea Most members of the party are too weak for this... Too weak The strong have to lead People like you and me, you know? Just wait until more kids are out of work Then our time will have come Mother! Beethoven, The 11th Variation on Jules Maccabeus. First attempt What do you want? Nothing He was always such a sweet and reasonable boy Why did you never tell him? He had everything he needed And now he'll never come back again Never It's all your fault What did you say? He was unhappy You don't know you're saying No... I do know what I'm saying He never complained He did to me You never encouraged him, always picked on him - Do this, do that... - Shut up Don't bring any girls back, do this... Shut up! It's your fault He killed himself because of you You never showed him any love or affection That's not true You never gave a shit about us Never cared if we were happy or sad All you worried about was money... Yes, you're good at that For you the world is in perfect order... when you hold a silver spoon and the TV is turned on That's not true It's true... You remember when Ernst was seriously ill... you never even bothered to go and see how he was In those days we were still deep in debt I had to drive a truck day and night to repay the creditors You forget that Fuck your truck and fuck your money You only care about yourself Damn it. Stop this Don't you slam that door in my face! Shall I tell you what you are? You're a murderer The guilt is yours, so it seems to me Get out I never want to see you again Never Why are you here? What's up? Can I stay here? - No, the place is a shit hole - I don't care But I do - What's up anyway? - Nothing... But can I stay here or not? I guess so - Hi - Hi - Who's he? - You don't know him You want to talk? Forget it This is all there is - Turn the fucking light off! - Turn it off yourself Come on Shit There's no beer Sit down. You've had enough as it is Get me a beer I said I want a beer Stay there Get it yourself You can't send her out this late Then you get it Get me a beer, I said Get it yourself - Get lost - Telling me to get lost? You dirty whore - Don't you say that - You're a cheap whore - Whose kids are they anyway? - I don't know - I bet you don't - Kiss my arse - Charly, quick, come on - Leave me out of it Help her Got the message? Leave her alone Get off Stay out of this Stay out I'm warning you You're not man enough yet This drives me crazy. I want to get out of here I can't stand it any more Where“ you go? I'll go and join Günthers camp Can I come? You have to prove your loyalty first Did you? - Yes, this afternoon - What did you have to do? I'm not allowed to say, not to anyone But we're friends, aren't we? Can you tell me what the time is? 11.30 What...? Welcome guys, had a good trip? - Michael will check you in - I'll show you the quarters - How's the food? - Really good Get your uniforms Hi... How was the trip? Same as usual I brought a few more recruits for you Next Next Next Jump into it Show more effort Practice makes perfect Watch me Attention Arms to order! At ease Dismissed. Weapons cleaning duty Good evening, please go up to the first floor Suddenly there was a shot... and my buddy who was next to me, fell down Just like that... bang... gone We immediately surrounded the village... and ordered all the men out A few of them were even younger than you are now They were still kids All wearing just rags You should have seen those Russian rats beg for the lives But we had no mercy for the partisans We made them dig their own graves, had them drop their pants... aimed a rifle at their necks and blasted them into the grave Orders are orders Must be obeyed You'll be able to order a military organization like ours... to do anything you want You can command them to carry out directives... armed or unarmed You will realize... only military trained units... with absolute loyalty... can successfully execute such directives No matter what they are And you can rest assured that all orders... will be carried out in the most effective manner No-one's questioning that. Why the excitement? My party and I don't care if you overdo it a little We are all nationalists... and anti-communist So there's no difference between us Your party rules are too restricting We want to form a united strike force An official merger like that would create too much visibility A merger on that scale would immediately draw violent opposition My goal... our goal, is to provoke chaos with bombs I totally agree with you Anything that contributes to the collapse of this government Throw bombs into the crowds Create chaos by shooting and bombing, I don't mind In fact you have my support. But NOT in the name of the party Our party must remain clean We can't be connected with this We want power. We want control in parliament That's why we must remain clean in the public eye What about women? Did you have fun? Of course... All the time Partisan women were the best One time we got orders to retreat... because the partisans had blown up a bridge On the way we passed a Russian farm house... occupied by a women and a small child She gave us coffee and bread, a bit of marmalade After we'd finished eating, the fun started... The woman was still young, we were only 18 ourselves The woman held her child, a little girl, about 3 years old We blew the kid's head off by shooting it through the mouth Then we fucked the woman After that we smothered her with a pillow And finished her off with a Lüger I think we can be happy with the results of the meeting Absolutely - Anything else? - No thanks - Coffee? - Yes, please You must continue to operate in small units We are not ready... yet. But time is in our favour We'll make our move soon Wake up! Good morning guys Come on, get moving Out of bed, the sun is shining Quickly now Rise and shine, you lot I was on the lecture circuit in the USA Perfectly organized In Kentucky for example our cause was well received Wherever we went people were enthusiastic It proves that we are not isolated internationally Everywhere there are people who feel like we do I envy you for the clean air here Whenever you pick up a weapon, always safety first Keep your finger off the trigger When loading a gun point it towards the enemy When you hand it to a comrade, always like this Hold it firmly it won't bite Not towards a comrade, always at the enemy Yes sir See? - Let me, Günther - Here you go Not so hard. Are you crazy? Shut up, it's only a game I didn't agree to do it naked Silence! Jewish pig - Where the execution? - In the quarry Aim the first shot at the temple, understand? The second one...
