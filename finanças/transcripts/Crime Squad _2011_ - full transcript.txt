Sister-in-law, this is Tae Shik. It's been a long time. Sorry... But... Yu Ri is back, right? -= Episode 14 =- What? -= Episode 14 =- She didn't come back? No, no, no... It's nothing. I'll call you back later. Yeah. What's all this? Didn't you just take her home? I took her to the front of her home, these kids... It is just less than a few days, how can it be easily break off? Call her cell phone. Recently children all do not listen. What? She called me. = The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable. = What's wrong? = The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable. = I told her to call me if there was any trouble. She just called me earlier, but she didn't answer the phone now when I called her. Hyungnim, what's her phone number? Hey! Find it quickly! Found it. The signal was lost at Cheongdam-dong. Cheongdam-dong, how can it be there? That can't be. Please check again. Yes. This is Kangnam Police Station's Officer Park. How can I help you? Is it Yu Ri? Yeah. What? Okay, Got it. We are coming immediately. Seo Hee Ran woke up. Let's go. 'Three year old', quickly. She already regained consciousness, but her mind is still unclear. We still have to observe her for a while. Hey, Ms. Seo Hee Ran, can you see us? I know it's hard for you, but do you remember anything? Like the appearance of the perpetrator. What is this place? I... Why am I here? It's better to go back for now. The trauma from the incident has made her lose her memory temporarily. It's better to wait for a while. Don't push her too hard, it's more important to find the killer . Sister-in-law, Yu Ri still isn't back yet? What? Hey, I can't stay still. I have to go. You said it was Cheongdam-dong. I'll go with you. Enjoy your meal. How come you are alone today? Where is Officer Park? Isn't there a case? Moreover, we are not in such a relationship, where we have to be together. Is something wrong? Want a drink? What? No. What with the "No"? What happened? Drink... There is nothing wrong between us. There are no problems at all. Although, I want to drink but I can't drink. I let you drink but how can you not drink? But, where did the Ajussi go to? (Ajussi - Older man, uncle) That ajussi? Mr. Jo Sung Tae. I would like to see him again. That... That ajussi, I don't know where he is or what he is doing. The signal was lost here. There is no CCTV here. Hyungnim! It can't be... it's not. It is better to send it to the forensics team first. Warehouse! Warehouse! What? We still need to go there again? You know we just went there. Let's go and check it out. Hurry up. Yeah, we are at the warehouse. Okay, got it. You did well. Now stop right there. Over there... then you will not become dirty. It's there. However, those things are still over there. If the heart is weak.... Is this committed by someone who has a heart? He is not human, he is a beast. Yu Ri! Yu Ri! Yu Ri! Yu Ri! Yu Ri! Yu Ri! Hold on. Yu Ri! Yu Ri! Hurry up! Yu Ri! Yu Ri! Yu Ri! - Yu Ri. Wake up, wake up. Yu Ri. - How is she? - First, call the emergency line - Call the emergency line, Yu Ri, faster, faster, faster - Yu Ri! - Quickly answer the phone. Hyung! If something goes wrong, what will I do? To my brother, she was like a son. If something goes wrong, how will I face sister-in-law? Officer Nam. It's all my fault. It's all my fault. Is Yu Ri alright? Did she wake up? When she was brought here, her heart had already stopped beating. Yu Ri! Yu Ri! Hyung. Yu Ri! Yu Ri! - Yu Ri! - Hyung. Yu Ri! Yu Ri! Yu Ri! I heard that there will be no briefing. - What? - Why? What? Why? They said the case is not solved yet and there are no further clues. Is it true the dead person went to the bar called 10%? It hasn't been confirmed. 10%? Bring all the information gathered so far to the conference room. Keep an eye on Officer Nam to prevent him from taking action alone. Yeah. Have you checked the last CCTV recordings of Yu Ri? I couldn't see anything. He intentionally avoided the CCTVs. It appears that he knew the positioning of the CCTV. No matter what, in Yu Ri's case The only clue is the bar called 10%. We can only focus on that. This can be difficult. After all, it is a shameful matter. It does not matter if the person is selling or buying. How can we know? What about the people who were with Yu Ri yesterday? Underground pimps and the guests over there, we have not found anything suspicious. The way the customers call their escorts, I feel this is very suspicious. Kang Hyu Sil also received the gifts. Yesterday, it seemed Yu Ri was introduced to him. Bang Sung Jin, who is he? After some investigation, he is the third son of the President of Cho Yong group. If he is the third son, isn't he a celebrity? He cleverly hid his identity to escape. This is a really difficult situation. Anyway, the time to get a search warrant will be tight. Let's focus on our surroundings. Continue to observe Seo Hee Ran's state. Okay. Officer Nam is not here. -= The number you have dialed is currently switched off, please leave the message after the beep. =- Ya! This person didn't get into some sort of trouble? Even if it is trouble, it is just going to be an investigation. Don't worry about that. Ah, yes. Is this the National Forensics Service? That seal, have you restored it? Yeah, I got it. Anyone has a seal. How can we find anything? But still... that's the only clue left. Officer Shin, let me have a look at the CCTV videos that have been screened during this time. Okay. I too sometimes think that, but... between us, Hae In is not there. Let's forget okay? Hae In, mother... is very sorry. Father became like that, Hae In is suffering alone. It's difficult, isn't it? I am sorry. Mom will always be sorry towards Hae In, and will miss you everyday. But Hae In... mother may not be able to see Hae In often. So... Hae In, can you come over to mom's side? Then, just like your father. Mother can too. Everyday, Hae In is in here and stays here. What's the matter? You did not say hello. If I am not here, what are you going to do? Father, looks like you need to find someone. What? Who is the person? A person to work for the consortium. What? You! I want to go back. Now, I don't have any more reasons to stay here. Please don't speak like that. Go? Where to? I beg you, please let me do what I want. I beg you. Eun Young. Quickly, find someone to replace me so I can leave as soon as possible. So what are we going to do with the 10% employees' interviews? 10%? For the 10% employees' interviews, we have to go there! Can we even go in? Then we have to dress up. So how are we going to dress so that we can enter? For a 10% employee, looking like a 10% employee is very easy. Please say. Does she even have the ability to be a 10% employee (a call girl)? How much do you think she'll cost? I can't even estimate the cost. 10% girls all looked like celebrities. Well in case of reporter Jo, she can go clubbing. Sunbae! I am not joking. It's to investigate the serial murders. Sunbae, can't you help with anything? Did I say anything wrong? She said... 10%? President, have you been there? Hey! how can you say this to your sunbae? Why? What are you doing? I will not cause any trouble so you guys get out of here. What are you doing exactly? Talk to me for a while. Let go of me! Anyway, I know what you are doing. These things you are doing, doing them right in front of the police does not bring you any benefits, does it? Here, we do not need to rely on the lower-ranked police officers. I want to ask you something. I am now getting angry. Do you want me to remove this badge... ...and point this gun at you? Even if you do so, I don't have anything to tell you. I worked really hard to train those girls. I have also suffered a big loss. Loss. Everyone is dead and you talk only about money. Oh, okay, forget it. If you are still a human being, you would not have lured those girls. Letting them serve this boss and that boss, right? What are you saying? It looks like you don't want to be a police officer anymore. That is none of your business. Let me ask you. Who is the asshole who asked for Yu Ri? I don't know. Even if I know, I will not tell you. Who was it? I can go right after listening to your crap? You bitch! Let me go, let me go. You aren't letting me go? Where are you going? This will probably take some time. Can you send it to me? Once it's complete I will send you an e-mail. But Officer Park, When we were little, this seal used to be round. That's right. This is my first time seeing a square seal. By any chance, it was personally made by the killer? That is to say, it does look a bit strange. That's true. If it was manufactured at a factory, the font should not be like that. Looks like it will be hard to find. You also cannot search the country's primary schools. Anyway, thank you. I am depending on you. Okay. Oh, what is it? Officer Nam is in trouble, quickly come back. What? Ah, really... Okay, I am coming immediately. Hey! What happened? What kind of trouble was caused? I heard he used his fist when he went to look for the pimp. He went alone? Yes. To have caused this mess, what can we do? So... where is he now? After stirring up trouble, not sure where he went. He disappeared. If you find anything about Officer Nam, then tell me. Hey, exactly why did he use his fists? Using his fists is not the issue here, but who did he use his fists on is the issue. I don't know which god is backing this pimp. Officer Nam will be disciplined when he comes back. What? Really... making our lives difficult. Did you find anything? I have been looking at the CCTV but nothing yet so far. Seo Hee Ran? The hospital would call us once she is awake. No news from them yet. I'll go and see. Ms Seo Hee Ran. What's the matter? It's all right, it's all right. Song, that song, don't sing that song. What song? Don't sing anymore. It's okay. No one will sing. I also like this song. That is to say the killer sang this song, right? Seo Hee Ran reacted strongly to this song... ...so to speak, it is possible. Besides that, it would be good if she could remember something else. Ah, right. During your primary school days, have you seen this type of stamp? Isn't this 'Well done'? But why is this square? We had the round one. It is probably one that is not sold. Officer Park, do you want me to upload this on the Internet? Internet? Internet? Some people may know about this. It's done. You can go now. If someone recognizes it, I will immediately contact you. Okay. Hey! You too be more careful. Okay. Hello. Why is he there? Did he come out to get something? Yes. Hey, Dong Jin, what did you get just now? Hyungnim, where are you? None of your business. What is it exactly, you brat? Where are you hiding? Quickly come out. What are you doing in that place? What is this? Chief Jung told me to get Bang Sung Jin's schedule, so I came. Let's go. So this is Bang Sung Jin's recent whereabouts? Yes. But hyungnim, why did you do that? Anyway, before the case gets solved, you are uncomfortable. I really don't want to do it anymore. What? Look ahead. Okay. Lee Sook Jin, Kang Hyu Sil, Seo Hee Ran. Do you remember the dates of their incidents? It should be here. - Dong Jin. - Yes. Let's arrest him. We can arrest him now. Did you find out something? Hey! What is this? You know but still ask. We are police officers. So? what do you plan to do? Come with us. Why do I have to go with you? Otherwise, here here here. On these days, what were you doing? Get in. What's your name? Which department are you from? - I am Nam Tae Shik. - Leave him. Department, Kangnam Police Department. Is it enough? Come with us. I am coming... If I go, you're going to come with me. You know that? Okay? I really want to go since I didn't go home for 4 days. So don't worry about me and just come with me. April 7, April 13, April 16, and also two days ago, Where were you? Don't say anything. Do you have any evidence? Only on these days, Bang Sung Jin's whereabouts are unknown. Coincidentally, murders happened on those dates. These alone can't be counted as evidence. You should know. It can't be considered as evidence. The madam and the other girls are related to you. If you can't provide an alibi, You know that we have to focus on you, Bang Sung Jin. Let's do it this way. I can guarantee that he will not escape. First, let him go. I will reply on time. Hyung! I am sorry. But how can I remain silent? But look at you. Go get some sleep now. Do you think you look okay too? All detectives look like this. That's right. You can only say this? It's difficult. We can't keep them just with an unknown alibi. So, what to do next? We have to wait until Seo Hee Ran remembers something. To me, hyung you were my first master. So, you'll be a better detective than I was. My elder brother always scolded me. It was so hard to keep up with him. Whenever there was a case, he would just go without thinking about himself. Being with that kind of guy, it really drove me crazy. But... With just one stab, he left us. As I removed the knife stabbed in his stomach, really... really hated this job. That day, I told myself not to do my best. Mi Young is here? Yes. According to the President, she comes to this shop. Today she has an appointment. So, what should I do? You need a list of clients or anything related to the 10% girls, right? She always brings it with her. You want me to steal... Do you have something in mind? Welcome, do you want to do your hair? My friend is here. Who? Here, I am here. Oh! Did you lose something? Just now, I was sitting here. The ring that I was wearing suddenly disappeared. Why didn't you tell us? We were afraid that it might affect other customers' feelings. I did not want to bother you. I'll look for it quietly, is that okay? Well... Open this, I want to take a look. Inside are the guest's clothes and bags. I already showed you this, didn't I? You can stand next to me and watch. Are you alright? Nothing. Ah! Why! It's not here. Did you really lose it? No, it was obviously... Oh my, my bad. It was here. Omo! Uncle, how can you be so confused? - Uncle! - Sorry. As you can see, Kwon Mi Young's bar isn't just one. Thus, Lee Sook Jin, Kang Hyo Jin and others were all under Kwon Mi Young. She really is big time. I knew it since the beginning. And these four girls were selected by Bang Sung Jin. The dates he called them out matches the occurrence dates of the incidents. Got it. Call Kwon Mi Young. Okay. Then we can really arrest them now? Now, what can you say? Should I send this case to the prosecutor right away? President Bang. This may be the better way. What are you saying? Do both of you want to discuss this? I'll leave you two alone to talk. Chief Jung, let's talk about this. President Bang's alibi... I will tell you. Where was he? First, you promise me. Are you negotiating right now? That.. You can check the CCTV recordings of Lami Hotel. Lami hotels. What were you doing there? You will know when you see it. No matter what... I am begging you. What he was doing... make sure to keep it a secret. No, other girls wanted to go out with Mr. Bang. but those girls didn't want to go. So on that day, you didn't go? I did . However, after playing with him, they all go back home. Also, that person plays a bit dirty. But this is just to make money, why be so picky? Just close your eyes and you can earn a lot of money. Hey, do you think that makes sense? Anyway, all the girls came out alive after meeting with President Bang. President Bang could have gone after them. That person does not have the guts to do something like that. He could have complained to our bar. Anyway, whenever he comes to our bar, something is always broken. The staff are also hurt. And finally, they take me to the police. So, he complained in the bar when the girls died? Do you think he wouldn't? I really cannot imagine. Wine, woman, drugs. However, in which direction are we going to investigate? This culprit is really extreme. Where are you going? Don't worry, I will not cause any trouble. I am going to see Seo Hee Ran. Besides that, are there any other means? Hyung! But, it's really strange. How come it's exactly the same days? Bang Sung Jin selects those girls and gets dumped, then complains in the bars. Besides Bang Sung Jin, are there others who know? If it's not Young Mi, then her staff. Three year old, let's go. -You came! -Yesterday, did you not find anything? Yes, but still have to wait and see.. As far as I know, someone was summoned. Wow! This is our fourth-grade class stamp. Jong Il Elementary School. Officer Park! What? Have a look at this. I heard that he is now the principal of Jong Il Elementary School. Aigoo, there are students who still have this? Is this your stamp? Wait... there must be one somewhere. Aigoo, I used to make these kind of things. I was creative and dexterous. I was able to make any material that were needed. Oh, it's here. Wait a moment. Oh, it's exactly the same. Teacher, you remember any special student. Special or unique student... Oh, all my students are special. Not in that sense but... Maybe scary or someone who is very under priviledged? Yeah. There must be something big going on. Well. Yes, it's important. Let me think. That kid was a bit special. His mother owned a bar. However, she committed suicide. Furthermore, he stayed with his mother's dead body for a week. Later I heard he went to an orphanage. Then he was adopted. He couldn't have stayed in his right mind. What could he have looked like as a grown-up? This picture just shows a child's face. He must be fine by now. After his mom died, he lost his mind? It's possible. How can we find him now? We can only guess his present appearance from his photo. Let's go to National Forensic Service. That was all Bang Sung Jin's doing. Is there anyone who knows that Bang Sung Jin is rampaging in your bar aside from you? The girls working in the bar, all know that. Look, our girls won't do such things. If you're suspicious, then I can give you all CCTV videos and their alibis. Did you call the police? Yes. We can't do anything by ourselves. Of course, we must call the police. This is Gye Po station's jurisdiction right? Yes, I think so. The policemen who were in action could have seen something. Let's get going. Yes. Even now... you can't remember anything? That time... how did you manage to escape? I can't remember. At that time in my mind, I didn't want to die. He was looking at me. And... He was singing. But suddenly he stopped singing. Then I think I heard something. What sounds? So after he moved from his old house, you don't have any trace of him? That's right. He changed his name every time he gets adopted. so we don't know his current name. When will they have the picture? They should have it by now. Hello, this is... Ah, yeah. Oh, really? Please send it. The photo is ready. When you went to that bar, have you seen anyone strange? I don't remember. Okay. Excuse me... but today, Ji Young Ho is not here? Who are you talking about? The guy who found the victim of this case. Officer Ji Young Ho? Is he not part of this station? As far as I know, there is no one with this name. Ji Young Ho. Section Chief, it's Ji Young Ho. Look for his position and issue his arrest warrant. We have already done that, but we can't find his current position. Where is Officer Nam? Hospital What was that noise? Well... = A case in Seo Cho Dong. A case in Seo Cho Dong.= Walkie-Talkie. Walkie-Talkie? You should go and get stamped. Hyung! Hyung! Wake up, hyung. Somebody! Somebody come quickly! Wake up! hyung. Quickly call the doctor. He is not at home. We're going to the warehouse and Officer Park is going to his old house. You were the last. If you didn't escape, Yu Ri would not have died. If you follow the light, you will find mother's shadow standing there... The remaining children watch their home... Ji Young Ho. I don't like. You did well. I don't want to. You did well. - You did well. - Slowly fell asleep... Mom, Mom. You did well. You did well. You did well. You did well. You did well. You did well. You did well. Ji Young Ho. Ji Young Ho. Hey, hey, wake up. Hey. They are coming out. They are finally coming out. - Why did you kill? - Why did you kill four people? How do you feel now? What was the suspect's motive? Besides this case, is it possible that there are other cases? The results of our investigation will be announced in a press conference later. We won't answer any questions now. - Please say something. - Tell us something about the case. Okay, I'll write an article right away. They should have a press conference. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I am sorry. Yeah. Three years ago, due to his mental state, he was dismissed from the police force. At that time, he must have stolen a walkie-talkie and other items. He must have heard all the reports with the walkie-talkie. Because all the women saw a police officer, they felt safe. We need to perform further psychiatric evaluation. It could affect the decision. Okay. He says that if he didn't stop them, in the end, the girls would have become dirtier. Either way, he'll be judged as a psychopath. Here, this is for the briefing. Seo Hee Ran, is she okay? She's okay. You're the problem. Look at you. All detectives look like this. It hurts. Ajussi? Reporter Jo! I'm so happy to see you. But what are you doing here? Someone I know lives here. But Reporter Jo, you also live here? Yes. Detective Kwon and I were worried about you. Why worry about me? Because I might do bad things again? No, I believe in ajussi. Me? You're also scary But the strange thing is I have this warm feeling. Ajussi if you are not busy, should I buy you something delicious? No, it's okay. Then in the future when I write stories and want to ask you something, can I call you? Of course, but I don't have phone. Ajusshi, then you can call me first. Ajussi, don't forget to keep in touch with me. Hurry. It's a promise then. Section Chief Jung Il Do. That night, I was really surprised. Why must it be you? What? But I realized, it's going to be fun. Did you really solve the case that happened five years ago? I really want to know. What is it? What do you mean? Yu Myung Chul's case. I did that. I also put a stamp at that place. You did well. You do not know?
