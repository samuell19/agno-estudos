This is a virgin forest in one sense. Don't misunderstand. This is a Women's college in Cochin completing 50 years. An eternal garden in spring. But this ladies' kingdom is facing tomorrow a historical crisis. Hey, you change that 'Vedana' in Malayalam to 'pain'. Pain is pain even in English. Central Susamma. Yes. What is this? Why gents in 'Aaromam'? Not 'Aaromam'.But 'Aaramam' means garden. Not she'll spit here and dirty the place. Annammo.- Yes. Tomorrow if P.T decides we'll lose everything. Then boys will come and loiter. To spoil that only our parents are landing tomorrow. Will they spoil it? - Ask when they will spoil it? Enough. Come. If the college is made mixed, can we wander like this? That doesn't matter. But you all would've time only to eat raw mangoes. Slowly slowly.- Hold the torch. Come... Has Aunty slept? Oh what a weight! Slept well.-"Has she slept, has she slept? Put a silencer in your mouth Mother is in, we are out." Aunty is in, we are out. "Nobody can go out from inside". What dear, are you not getting sleep? Go in and sleep. Don't stick it there. What? - I pulled down the curtain. Susamma, where's next? - Next on Princy's chest. Stick it Hey,the watchmen is coming... This pose is enough to take the old man's breath out.-Come Susamma, Susamma, - Where has she gone? Has she gone with the old man? My God! Has she pissed in the open air? Wretch, ljust washed my legs. Principal's stand is correct. What's wrong in making the college mixed? Will one become pregnant if she studies with boys? Ah! My dear. Long back my husband just stood in our verandah in the rain. When I missed the periods only I knew I was trapped. Oh! our boys have come. Even if the management gives consent, we can't take it granted that P.T.l will also agree. Before P.T.l meeting, there should've been a student's voting. Then 90% would have voted for mixed. The girls here with male hormones would've their arrogance decreased if the college is made mixed. Susamma! - What? Why that girl is murmuring. My Annamma, she has hypertension. What dear, you want the boys to come and loiter here?-Yes. My God! I am fed up with these girls. Why do we want other boys here? I don't know for sure whether you are girls. Then Maria, I'll clear your doubt first. - No need. What do you want now? You don't want boys. You all want boys. That after our course is completed, P.T.l will decide tomorrow. We'll see then. Your father is not the only one in P.T.l. My dear girl, will you kindly leave this place. Go without irritating. What is itching you? Aren't all these Annamma's fun. - Maria chedathi. ls it? Man and woman are mutually completing factors. They are two components which nature doesn't allow to separate. They are the basic components of home, society and even the State. Still due to some misunderstanding even now in this 21st century, there exist men's and women's college. For her it is enough to say like this. As guardians you think about it. According to this circular, if the management wishes, it can make the men's and women's college in Kerala into mixed. Management agreed to make this college mixed which is completing 50 years. Please sit down. Let me tell one thing. But the final decision will be taken if only the P.T allows. Fathers having daughters are not so fonlvard. I will join the principals party after I marry off my daughter. Anyway not now. I admitted my daughter here only because this is a women's college. There is modesty and discipline. Great modesty and discipline - That's not the reason. We have peace of mind when we send our daughters to this college. My dear Principal, thinking God, don't destroy it. I have a doubt. What's the most important problem? You are having a daughter or making the college mixed? Yes. What else is the problem? I should not say this before this crowd, but still, I say. I have three children. The eldest daughter went to a mixed college and eloped with an auto driver. Her life is gone. Then the second one. He also went to a mixed college. Before growing a moustache, he came to our house with a wayward girl. His life is in darkness. I have another daughter. Here. Let me at least marry off her with peace of mind, my dear Principal. I don't think there is need of voting. ls there, madam. No. So it is decided. Only girls should study here. So the meeting is dispersed. Hey, hey what is this? Are you going to cinematic dance? Nahi (no) Do you know Hindi? - Ja Ja (go) An Indian without knowing Hindi. Shame on you. Done well, Mathew Sir. Hey! You call me Pappa at least in front of your friends. OK Pappa. Did you roast the Princy? - Roasted? Fried well. Didn't I tell you, to spoil everything, there is nobody other than Mathew. The credit for that goes to your Daddy. He only played and gathered the crowd. When all of you compelled I toojoined. No, I ask because I don't know. What's the problem with mixed college? No uncle, it won't work. If boys come, what role do we have here? Oh, then that's the reason. Teacher, you're still angry. Leave it. You tried but lost. Mr Bahuleyan, I'm not angry with you. Ignorance is not a crime.- Yes. What??? I'll tell you one thing which is difficult for you to understand. According to the affiliation order of this college, one seat is reserved for a boy for P.G courses. I don't need your consent to fill that seat. That's my discretion. If any boy comes for that seat, I will give. That's up to me. That's up to me. Mathews, did you hear, what that woman said. She can teach a boy with her discretion in a women's college. What type of rule is this? For every PG course one seat is reserved for a boy. That's true. But so far nobody has come for it. Even if any one has applied, it was not given. Uncle don't worry about that. If anybody comes, we are there to see to it. That's enough. Hey, if that woman brings any boy, you must avoid him. If you do anything wrong, I'll kill you and throw you in a well, not like the elders. Then I'll go to Central Jail and take rest. Oh! Take it easy. Ok then,children,l'm going. I'm happy about one thing. - What Pappa? Not even one person has said a good thing about you. How will they say? I was brought up like that. Hey! There is only one more year, Pappa. It's very difficult to change my habits. No need. You enjoy. I like you being a bit naughty. Thank you. Shall I go? Bye. Anjali, I just said that to threaten Bahuleyan. If I give seat to a boy immediately, they'll take it in another sense. When we saw your management spirit & obstinacy we thought... Really you must do that. I know that boy. He has 80% marks for literature. He is good in extra curiculam activities too. No.1 Hockey player! Central State champion in hurdles. No need to tell about Martial Arts!! What a lot of prizes! This is your T.C. I have nothing to say. Receive it with grace. Sir, there are only two months to complete the course. Can't you allow him to sit for the exam at least. Well, we'll consider this. He is the first boy to come here. We should not see only the academic performance. Anjali, how is he related to you? - My son. Who? Shyam? Why have you such an enemity with me. Is it a plan to destroy my peace of mind? His friends and his surroundings made him like that. If he goes to that college for two more years I will die of anxiety. If he is here in our eyeshot, and among the girls, what rowdyism can he do? At last, will I have to leave this place? Is he willing? - I will make him agree. The story I'm going to present is called 'One among three thousand'. This story is taking place not in America or Africa but in a women's college in our own Cochin where 3000 beautiful girls study. Look that side. Those who have difficulty in looking that side can look this side. Do you see that smile? Did you see him drinking? Do you see him sitting and drinking? One who is tall 6 feet, for Arundathi... "He's handsome like a cupid".-Stop it. Don't waste your energy in speaking. Tell what's your decision. My dear boy, Great sinner, when Goddess Mahalakshmi is bringing you auto, you're declaring vehicle strike. Enough of your speech. - You just think. My dear boy, You're right in the centre of 3000 girls. Didn't you play with boys for three years? Now you play with girls for two years. This is like a dumb man getting lottery. Dumb man is your grandfather, Adhramaan. God has given me more than enough height, weight, colour and beauty. But you didn't give me a fortune like this. Then why like this? He has not given me. Stop it. You dirty people have taken money from my mother to make me agree. You enjoy it and go home. Hey, you tell your decision and go. I'll tell that to my mother. Before telling that you must remember one thing. Where will you get a seat with your conduct certificate? If you go with that, you won't get a seat even in a K.S.R.T.C bus. I will see to it. Good smell. There was a party. The sponsor is my friend. Mother, wait.- What? Till now you couldn't even see my friends. Why suddenly this love for them. I don't have any anger with anyone. When they asked for money for your having passed the exam, I gave them. Oh! Then it is not bribe to make me agree, isn't it? Yes. I you think so, let it be so. You will obey your friends only. What's the value for my words. Have I become unbearable mother? - Shyam! I agree. Let me give you a chance to correct me. Try and see. But... Why but? With what courage will I go there? Annamma- Yes.. With what courage is he coming here? He might be disgusted with his life. Othenlvise will anyone keep his head on the rail. Have anyone of you been Vanaja teacher's son? What is there to see? It is sure that he like a eunch. Lipstick is over. - We'll adjust with that eunch. Darling, my dear darling". - Hey, stop, stop stop. Sage Rishyasringa is coming to this Anga rajya kingdom,untouched by any man. We'll give a rousing reception to that - Rishyasringa, no, no the Red bindi! A young mischievous boy is coming to nibble the candy mountain alone He is an ant who wants to climb the branch of the honey tree He has beautiful eyes, a small dimple and jasmine flowers on his lips. Central He is the bridegroom of the girl who played on the banks of river Kalindi He is the hero who stole her dress that day He is the playful boy who stole butter breaking the pots here and there He's a thief who can slowly entice anyone by playing his flute Central He knows well how to break the bow of the sugarcane of love He is the god of love who has sweetness in his heart He can win over with his cunning look Pretty girls who come to Pooram festivals Will he come here and walking all over, measure this front yard with his steps? Central My dear beautiful girls This is the first time in the history of this college a boy is entering as a friend, classmate and brother First time a boy is going to join in our college. Welcome to our college. - Thank You Shyam Balagopalan First M.A English new admission He is the son of Vanaja teacher of the Sociology department You should not see him as an enemy Now let Shyam speak a few words Dear, Don't throw away our self respect Dear sisters I don't wish to call you like that So dear friends, actually this is a correction home for me What to say in Malayalam? Yes. Ajuvenile home So you all have the responsibility to correct me, isn't it? Then, I have no assurance that I'll study here for full two years We'll teach you Thank you. I'll teach you also what I know Then you know my mother is a teacher here So ifl show a little decency, you shouldn't misunderstand Thank you I invite our dear Anne Mathews representing the students for the welcome speech Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Our brother here is handsome, beautiful and above all a good speaker. Our luck I propose a welcome song, not a welcome speech I ride in the chariot of time to heaven" I ride to heaven" To see my own place" Stop it. Singing this song? Ma'm, I'll sing another song. "Lotus petal in the eyes" Superhit song, Ok? Lotus petal in the eyes, saffron on the cheeks" Anne, Come to my room. Meeting dispersed I told you then itself. Hello I couldn't get acquainted with you Oh! You've come to get acquainted? When he gets acquainted with 3000 girls, brother, will be exhausted,- isn't it? Hey, if you are planning to play here, son, we'll have work That's right. lfl play, you all will be free only after 10 months Shit! Within a day, he has become a star. How will he not become a star? He is hot, handsome and smart Don't they say love at first sight! I felt it You are really Bahuleyan's daughter. It's not for nothing he sent you here This is a hereditary disease - Lovesophilia Your father isn't lucky to marry you off after inviting some persons Anyway he has come. Now before anyone snatches him, we'll snatch him Wretches. As soon as these two smell a man... For that are we not women? Good for nothing fellow. This is the third time He's a fashion designer - Yes You give it to me. I'll cure his illness Hello Ranjit, I thought over it. I'm interested Where is Ranju's office? We can see personally Ok? Did you see? It's not catwalk. You must walk like a swan Like Kerala tradition. Not like a foreign lady Central You must praise those who wear saree. Difficulty in wearing it! Why is the girl laughing? The credit of all this goes to Attukal Ramakrishnan, what he predicts is perfect. When he saw my horoscope, he said that I will get everything I wished for. Venus at the zenith in Pisces, in the seventh house. To tell the truth, I didn't think that you'll agree so soon even in my dream. Did the astrologer tell you that there is a possibility of your tail being cut this week? That is, lf we tell her father about this, he'll finish your problem in one day itself. Oh! Don't tell her fatherjust now. First the girl should be interested. After that two days rehearsal in the ramp. Shit! No need of these now. Hey, this is the girl I told you about. Where will you get such an apt girl to present Kerala traditional item? Cute girl.- Brother? - What? She told you many times in a simple language that she's not interested to become a model. You've seen only girls who fall flat when they hear about a feminine show. She's not that type. So you fold your wish into eight and put it into your pocket. Girl, give some way. This is jealousy. I know that you're interested. Don't decide at once. I'll keep calling you. I have the need. Go and see Aattukal Ramakrishnan (Astrologer) once again. Loss of limbs or loss of fame, either one is sure. Let's go. Hey, Shyam. What is that? That is nothing. Ma'm. Central Hey, Shyam. What is that? What's in your hand? It seems to be something like bread Ma'm. Bread?- Yes. Oh! Somebody take it. Oh my God Shyam here. Why are you loitering there? No. Simply- This will be a problem. The next burden. I searched you in the classroom. Coming? I'll offer you a coffee. - No. Now I'm busy. Preetha, one minute. Where is the toilet? Oh! That's it. That's why you look like a hen about to lay an egg. There. From there, turn right. Stop stop stop. Where are you going? This is ladies toilet. Is it written there that it's only for ladies? You go and tell those who are inside. I've an urgency. Go fast... I'll count till 10. If they don't come out. Then I'll enter. One, two, three. Why are you laughing? Four, five, come soon. Tell me dear, how is the place. My dear Pappa, it is a margin free market of girls. You can select whom you like. Nobody will say anything. Oh God, if you've drawn on my head. What you've drawn on his feet... Have you decided to stay there. Oh! For that you must ask your father. I was suspended 9 times within 3 years in men's college. Seven Police case also. After all, women's college. You see. At the maximum one month, I'll get dismissal. Ha, what's wrong with you? For all those pretty girls you're the only one there. You study there only. You tell us the teachings and torturing there. What do you know about the condition there? That's the place where five girls raped and killed a 17 year old milk boy. Oh! that is death! We'll also die of some itching, vomiting or something. His soul will be in heaven. Who is Shyam Balagopalan, studying in women's college? People have started coming to enquire. Iam Shyam. Who are you? I'm Ranjit. I'm a busy fashion designer. Then you come when you are not busy. Go. I want to tell one thing personally to Shyam. I want your help Shyam. She's in your college. Where where?- Video is good. She is not match for you. What a beauty! Not a marriage proposal. This girl is apt for a feminine show I'm going to present. I had approached her. But she doesn't show interest. Then I heard about you. If you know this girl, you must help me. I know her. But I can't help you. Here. Beer is over. Say O.K. Not that we don't have money. The beer is over. What are you doing Pappa. Do it for him.l know him well He's our friend. Go and buy beer Shyam, if you try, it will be possible. I don't assure you; but I'll try. There is a rule in this Ponnapuram fort which this boy doesn't know. We must teach him these rules. Little lambs, move, Please please. Sosamma, Look at this. What does it say? Oh! this is about our petticoat circular. Read this. You must not leave a single punctuation. Now translation. That means all students should wear a petticoat when coming to college. What is this petticoat? Shouldn't our brother know? That is our chemise chemise. - Yes. That's right. Wait, one doubt. Does it say that it should be worn by girls students only? No. It says all students.All. Oh! This brother is not wearing. Mary, this brother is not wearing. This circular is old. When there were no boys. What's the use? This circular is neither withdrawn nor amended. So you go. So Dinesi, you'll get from me. I'll report. You go and do that. Dear, you wear this. We should not break the law. Good. Ok. It's everyone's wish. Let it be. But before that I want to see whether you all are wearing this thing. Rule is for everyone. - Oh it is return back to us ls Nandana wearing petticoat? What? Shall I see? No! Are you wearing? ls Susan wearing? What if you all run like this.Let me see. If I don't do that, who will see about it? Central Annamma I trust you. Even if you're not wearing anything today you must be wearing it. Everyone should see properly. I'm going to wear this. All of you see. I'm ready. Ok ok. So our brother has obeyed the rule. Everyone clap. Ok. We're dispersing. Let our brother change the dress and become handsome again. Ah! stop, stop, stop! Ifl remove this dress now, it will be breaking the rule again. So I'm going to wear this till this rule is amended. It has back fired on us. Is your petticoat like this? Are you shy? Move! Iwill go Stop, stop, Stop! One more, One more. Are you not satisfied? There is no use of scolding only Shyam. Anna and friends made their problem deteriorate. Go and give this circular to Shyam. Then tell him to change the dress and come to see me. Mary, what all to be seen! Principal, are you sitting here? That boy is doing fashion parade in the canteen. You come, and change the channel. Ah! you're hiding here! Teacher you got only this boy in this size or you got others? No more speech, Maria, go. I'll do whatever is needed. Hey, you've not seen. It will be over soon. You come. Hereafter how will I face the students? I'll take leave. Anjali, do you know who should get beating with a cane on the buttocks? That Ann Mathews, that naughty girl. No. For me. Only then I won't do such things again. Now if those foolish parents hear about this, all will come. They won't leave it like that. I'm not speaking as a PT President. As an ordinary guardian. What action did Madam take such atrocity took place in front of her eyes? From the previous college he got suspension for 9 times within 3 years and 7 police cases. Admitting such a boy here, is to give work for us, isn't it teacher? Haven't you heard the proverb, "To kill the rats, you burn the house!" Ok. agreed. Indeed action should be taken for what has happened. All right. Let us take action. What happened? Suspension is certain. They are calling you. For blocking a student in the class as a group and making him wear petticoat. Mathews, I need not tell you specially. This is ragging. Here is your daughter's suspension order. For wearing indecent dress in the college campus and for entering ladies toilet knowingly. Here is your suspension. Both of you go home for 15 days. Let the enquiry be over. Moreover, it is the responsibility of the Principal to inform the police when a ragging takes place. It's a non-bailable offence,three years in jail. Here, Shyam, write a complaint. Let it go as per procedure. No Madam. I've taken it as fun only. From the light of experience, I tell you that police station, arrest, etc are not good. Especially for a girl from a good family. That is not my concern. No Madam. Hey, stop there, you stupid girl. It's not because I love you that I didn't give the complaint. If everybody knows that a silly girl like you had ragged me, what is the use of my living. Then you agree that I'd ragged you. Come come. My dear friend, I ask because I don't know, was this thing born during emergency period? My dear friend, leave it. Move a little, girl. As daughter so is father. Hey, what are you standing here for? Go to your class. Nandu, we'll see after 15 days. Call me. You are the only son isn't it? Don't make that teacher cry. You can't fight with me outside this college. You'll pass urine. Among the three, this is the only one left. I'll see to her.- What? Uncle you go. Come... come... A flower carpet with vessels. Aunty, what happened? Has he started attacking inside the house also? Won't it break if I throw? It is my mistake. Let him study wherever he wants. Anyway both of us shouldn't be there. Don't make such tough decisions. It is we who made him agree. We too have responsibility on him. Let us scold him. Hey Shyam? Pappa, don't act before me. I know you're going to congratulate, not to scold. Who is this- a new little lamb? Good morning aunty. I am Ranjit. Shyam's friend. Vivaldi's official designer. Good. That's a suitable school to learn, mischief. My actual company is in Bombay. I've designed this. Is it not old fashion? You've shattered all our dreams. Not yet entered the college. You got suspension for fighting with a silly girl. Is it our fault to expect 30-35 love affairs and 4-5 little torturing. Even if you were dismissed we would have been proud. Dismissal for small tiff with a girll? If it was a boy in her place, you can ask when his rib was broken. Oh! It's ok. You call her. We'll call and abuse parents, grandmother and great grandmother. Hearing it she must break down and commit suicide. Tell me 4 bad names. Shyam has done nothing wrong to get scolding. She is an arrogant girl. Hey! we told you to tell us 4 fashionable abuses for her. No need of that. That girl is a woman. She is not your mother or sister. Tell us 4 names. Stupid girl.- No. Useless or idiot. You good for nothing. We don't want these LKG abuses. Come here Any wild abuse like this? - Ring is going. From her abuse, it seems that she is from Kodungallur side. Central I'll cut your round chocolate body and make it into salted pickle today with a needle and a thread, I'll make your bloated chest into a kite today You're a cat who steals boiled milk You're a fly who fell into my eye I'll cut your round chocolate body and make it into salted pickle today with a needle and a thread, I'll make your bloated chest into a kite today Central Hey beautiful girl who gnawed my life I'll trap you with heated coconut Hey handsome man, I'll clean your brain Before a man you'll become punctured Before a woman you'll lose your teeth For that you need courage I'll cut your round chocolate body and make it into salted pickle today with a needle and a thread, I'll make your bloated chest into a kite today Girl, I'll keep my nose on your cheek Central Your eyes which are like eggs will be filled with ground chilly We'll draw pictures on your head Little witch, you will fall down Your chin will become chutney You must forget greed I'll cut your round chocolate body and make it into salted pickle today with a needle and a thread, I'll make your bloated chest into a kite today Annamma, that girl is again standing, for giving us work. We made her chairman last year, though we helped her. That won't work this time. She is very conscious. She is coming. That witch. Greetings He is here You wait here, lwill be back in a minute. Isn't it enough? No. You go and get one nomination form. - Are you going to stand? Oh! Such an idiot. Who will vote for me here. First you do what I tell. Don't blink. We can see a fight now. She is giving us an opportunity to let Shyam stand with us. Hi Annamma Sir, you took charge in the morning itelf. Shouldn't I take charge atleast 10 minutes before you. Then how? Let's start our second round. We' ll start. See, all the wretches are looking. Brother, start. We're going to some lonely place. You keep quiet Annamma. We men shouldn't be frightened. Anyway, thank you very much. - Why? For helping me.- Help? Because you helped me to give a surprise to many idiotic girls. These are all not surprises. Annamma, you yourself are a Himalayan surprise. Oh Jesus! Then, how was my chief enemy's 15 days. Very boring. When there is no war, won't American President Bush feel a bore. One International bore. Like that. Every night I think about how to rag you. To tell the truth Annamma when I see you the first thing I feel is God! If she is a boy I could have thrashed and crushed his chest. Then the relief is at least you're there in the campus for time passing. Yes, brother. When the matters have to come to this stage, there is no need of a formal discussion. We'll sign the treaty straightaway, ok? This is a nomination paper. Nandhana is contesting for chairperson. Shyam, you're going to nominate. Let this be our friendship treaty. Sign it. Why Annamma, you're wasting my one signature. Is there any use of it? Preetha is the darling of the students. You're all pain in the neck. This is not merely a signature, master. - It's only a trick. What?- Sign, Sign, where? Here. Oh God. Here come. - Don't make this a habit. You leave the place without hanging about. - Thanking you Aunty. Girl, if he has to take such a risk, he must have some urgent need. He'll go with you only. I've come to see Vanaja Aunty. Then only I knew you were here. This is Ranju. My friend. A very good fashion designer. Whom are you introducing? I know them already. This Nandhana is presenting the main item in my Femina show. Is it? Have you decided? He is like that always. He will take decisions only which will shock everyone Congrats. Your luck. How many times did I tell you. My father doesn't like all this. Then, you like. That's enough for me. Susamma,in this Malayalam Country, she is the only pretty girl to become a model. Isn't it?- Yes.- Then, we can't blame this brother. Never. Be careful of this girl. She is as if sulfuric acid is having hands and legs. Son, designer. It is Pappa. ls it? That's ok? Mathew, are you telling me that I'm of marriageable age. I don't have any problem in seeing. But if he is some chocolate boy, I'll scare him. Don't you know my concept,then listen. Even if he isn't like Mammootty and Mohanlal, he must be able to fight with 2 persons. Even if he drinks a quarter, he should be able to sing. He should be able to sing 'Town, town, a big ocean' without slurring. Then...oh is it enough? Leave me. Mathews is searching a boy for me. Whatever it is Mathews will suffer a lot. Good Morning,- Shyam, all the best. We'll support you.- Support? You could've told me a word that you're going to contest. Preetha, I didn't know about this. I'm only happy. I'll withdraw. I have a request. Don't consider me as a stranger. Central You bitch, what did you think. Shyam, please.- Don't speak. I've come here after doing wicked things which you couldn't have dreamt. You're a girl. Othenlvise I would've had to scrape you from the wall. Cool down. Shyam, take it as fun. Before this also I took it as fun. A new fun. I'm going to withdraw the nomination. It is not because I wish to see you as a chairman. Just to give her a work. All the girls here are standing here melting for you. We want a goal in your expense. That's all. Then, a small misunderstanding. I thought we are of the same wavelength and you will enjoy. It's all right. Go, brother, and withdraw. You don't be happy after seeing this. You see, when the ballot box is opened, you'll cry. We'll see who'll cry? When to withdraw, I'll be declared as unanimously elected. Come Shyam. They may tell that you're withdrawing because you like me. Let them tell. It is over if we agree. I'm not withdrawing. The St.Mary's College has got a nomination for the chairman for the first time. So we can take it as a friendly match. Why did you challenge? When the ballot box is open, you will cry. Did we think that he will do like this. I said a punch line to stop the scene. Anyway, it is gone out of our hands. Wasn't it your wish that you wanted a goal in my expense. Then, let it be. Here. Please listen. This is our leader. Shyam BalaGopal. Our K.K.P.P. contestant. Chairperson contestant. KKPP? It means all to get nothing to lose. To get a chairman for the first time, in our college, please give your valuable votes for our... Why Congrats, now? Shyam, you told me that it's a friendly match. No need of that. They'll be bored. Shyam Balagopalan is unanimously elected for the post of chairman. Hail Shyam Balagopal ! Hail our chairman Shyam Balagopal ! Where is Preetha, Where is Preetha? Son, Peethambara, because you withdrew your honour is not gone. You need a luck to lose an election also. Girl, Girl...Preetha girl, your office is closed. Annamma, good. Son, don't praise so much. - Oh, I lost. Now only you're a girl. That's because I've taken out the moustache. Brother, is it due to your wish, an experiment like this. Hey, even if it is, it's ok. But don't pull the line through the underground. Let's also know.- I'll tell. If you want to see her in dresses like this, You must buy with your money. - Don't take from us. Go... go... Tell me Shyam, in the eyes of my would-be, howl look. If you ask me, I'll carry and keep you in front of Vanaja teacher, & she'll bring the lamp. Is she that type? Hey idiot, we're seeing a change in you. Yes I am like that. It started when Mathews called me. What did he say? A fantastic boy is coming to meet me. This is dress rehearsal for it. You should all be there in the evening. I need all your moral support. I can't come in the evening. I've to go to a place with a friend. Oh! don't escape. All that after this. Then call your friends. Come. We should make the script ready. This 'girl seeing' is a test. You must not falter. For that who is faltering. That is because you don't know Annamma properly. This is the first time I'm seeing you, but I've heard about you. Though the boy is not good looking, - Like you... he'll be good at heart. What if he is good looking? Like him! The boy has come. Where? Hai, I am Manuel Abraham. They call me Manu. Pa..pa..pa..Pappa had told me. Sit down. Your shyness is not matching your appearance. I like saree. Pappa told me to become modern. Tea or coffee?- Milk and water is enough. One coffee. Why is she stammering? - Don't talk, let's hear her. I've some concepts about the bridegroom. Shall I tell? Tell. He should not drink.- Yes. He shouldn't smoke. He should come home at five in the evening. Then he should look after me and my children well.- Then. Here. Do you want anyone to translate here? Who are they? He is my friend. He has come to see you. Excuse me for interpreting. She is not well. So she should not be tense. Hai Pappa. He's choking. Still talking t0 him... I like him. I didn't ask that. Now I'll ask. Do you like me? A change is good. As Madam said let this boy lead. Let us see if we'll get the championship. Ernakulam University Youth festival is taking place after 7 years. If we try hard we'll get the championship. What do you know? My opinion is that this time also Preetha should lead. Shyam can bring anyone from outside to train the girls. As if we lack that only. The damage caused by that boy is not yet over. Then it is decided. Son, Dinesha, Please wait sir. What's the programme in the evening? - I am free. Why? Then we both will have to go to a place. So what? Which place? City Durbar. But city durbar will be a bit crowded. Shall we go to some park or beach? - Why brother? There is our Planter's annual meet there. You must drop me there. You can also tell cheers to my Mathews. That's it. To drop you! - Then what did you think? Nothing. So we'll see in the evening. See what Mathews has done. He has bought me a dress fit to be worn in some historical drama. He didn't get any other dress. It is tickling. Oh! As if you are going to wearjeans and tops for the whole of your life. Hey, this is a party. I couldn't see you after the war between you was over. Shall I ask you one thing? How did you manage to conquer this African country so soon? Come children. Oh, that's right. This is Abraham. Our Avarachan. This is my daughter Anna. This is Shyam, her friend. Rosy come here. Do you know this girl? Jesus, isn't this Ann? Though you have grown up, the same face. Ann, do you remember her? - She was your mummy's friend. Oh! Rosy Au nry- How did you know? - I knew when he called her. What is the secret? I was telling him not to drinktoo much. Good girl. Mathews needs control. What control Uncle? When I go to the hostel, he'll finish his quota before the cock crows. When I'm at home, he'll steal and drink escaping my eyes. Hey, hey. Come. Brother, you are hiding here. No Ann, I'm leaving. - That won't be proper. I'll let you go only after making you tell cheers to Mathews. Come. He.. hel, Hello.- fine dress. Jesus, I don't mind if you call me now. This is the first time I'm seeing my daughter with her tail cut. When have you started to sta..stammer? My dear daughter, you scared my son. Uncle had warned me that you'll play some trick, when I came to see you, but you scared me. Mathews, I can't wait any longer. Willingness and wedding should be decided soon. Why willingness now? My daughter told me she likes him. He also likes her. Then who else will not be willing? I will stand there. You stand here. Now the boy and girl. Central Central Do you have anything to tell me? What Pappa? I felt it was your prank when the girls seeing function failed. But it is not so. Isn't it? If it is so... Who is he? Shyam ? Pappa, I didn't think that anything serious had happened to tell you. That's why I'm disturbed since some days. I feel something about him, but I don't know if it can be called love. You can call like that. Sometimes it may be an infatuation. It can be like that also. Mathews, You tell something definitely. Can be, may be, like some weather reporters. How does he feel towards you? I don't know. I didn't ask. - He didn't tell me also. No.- what's this? Don't laugh at me. Oh, what a pity? You insult me. Howl brought you up? I thought that if you loved anyone you would tell him that openly. But you didn't. Instead of that you are pulling your face and playing, changing the channels. Who are you, a heroine in a serial? My Ann, at this age, you will feel like that. You must feel. But all these should not affect our lives badly. Pappa, I'll tell you one thing. For boys it is a passing fancy. Do you doubt it. Yes. Ann, he shouldn't feel love for you after his knowing that you love him. It is he who must tell you first. If he tells?-l'll approve your love. If othenNise,-You can decide whatever. Shyam Hello Shyam. She is asleep. Did you know the good news. The marriage is fixed. A good boy. It's enough if my daughter doesn't spoil him. Then I request you for all co-operation in advance. OK. Good night. Bye. What an acting? Bharat Gopi will stand back. Am I not your father? Iam expressing my thanks to Shyam who has given us the opportunity to enter our dreamland, the St. Mary's College, and to train the beauties there in various cultural programs to make them ready for the youth festival. Moreover, I again express my thanks to Shyam for arranging a hotel room for us to drink and make merry in the name of the youth festival. Actually, do you know any drama? I was University best actor for two years. And once 'Best talent'. Enough. Good to hear. Then you're the director. If there is kicking drama, I'll teach. Oh, the girls will kick you out. - Then what is my role. You're the assistant director. lam the person who brings tea to you all. I will be the screen boy. You are the curtain puller. Why are you dull? - No. Nothing. Hey, enough. You've taken too much already. Tell us your worries, whatever it is. - Let us enjoy. You know that girl, her marriage is fixed. Which girl?-That Ann Mathews. For that why do you worry like this? Don't you know her nature. That Manuel is not suitable for her. She is very depressed. Shall we cure her depression? There is only one way. Go to his house and beat him. Beat him?-No need of that. Your style of operation won't work in this case. I'll tell you a smooth approach. OK. When we go to spoil a marriage, we need a person who looks as if he is decent. You come.-| won't come. No, you don't come. Pappa, you put him in the vehicle. There is nobody else. - So come, son. No, this is wrong. That too in this midnight. Only going is at midnight. When we return it will be morning.-Why so? They will call the police. Police will make us stand till any person comes to take us on bail. Are you wearing undenNear?-Shame. Othenlvise the police will say shame shame. Come, what is this? ls this a house. Having a crown on the gate. If there is any problem you just howl. I will start the vehicle. We can't howl. My throat is bad. They shouldn't get some beatings. He is arrogant- How did you know that? Did you see the house. If he had given the money to the poor, they would've drunk and made merry. I don't have the habit of talking, only beating. Come, I'll open the dialogue. The rest you must do.- Open the door. Oh! It is illuminated like a church on festivals. If they had given the money for some poor, they would've spent the money and lost it on playing cards. Don't you remember me. We have seen. I'm Shyam. This is my friend, Pappan. Why at this time?-I'll tell you. Come. What? Who are they? Hello Uncle, don't you recognise me, we had met at the party. Pappa uncle drank too much. What is the matter? We've come to discuss a serious matter. At this midnight? That which you should say at midnight, you should say at midnight. That which you should say in the morning, in the morning. If you don't tell the things to be told at the right time, then you will have to tell the things which shouldn't be told at the wrong time, won't you? Leave it. What's the brand? Did you forget? The proverb is that you should not forget your mother and the brand of your liquor. Who are you? Tomorrow won't you tell you forget me also? Oh, even if we tell, you don't understand. Hey, after drinking four, can your sing the song Town, town, a big ocean" without slurring. I don't drink. You can't. When love swells up, can you carry her and dance like in the cinema? It's difficult-Yes. Your hip will break. What is this, talking nonsense after drinking. Pappa.-What, is your name Pappan. My name is also Pappan. Same pinch. Pappa be quiet. I know them. They are friends of Ann. That's the problem. Man Mathews. What I told you just now is Ann Mathews' concept about her would be. She knows that a man like you won't be able to do all these. He can do.They are deep love. Only you two don't know about it, that is you three. I didn't see mother. Does her family know this? Yes. They know. Oh, don't trust them. - No don't trust. But when they ask at the church for consent, she'll say that she doesn't like you. And I'll come and take her with me. Uncle don't take risk. Pappa. - This Pappan or that Pappan. Come. Town, town, a big ocean." Are you sitting here? Shall we go? Wait. Did you try to spoil the marriage just because she doesn't like it? What else? Is it not because you love her? Just an enquiry. I'll kill if anyone else know this. He just asked. So that's the matter. - Yes, why can't I have all these? Have you told her about this? No. However I tell her, there will be a silly touch. You know her character. My tail will be cut. This is safe. Manuel or his Pappa will call them and inform. She'll know about this without any work on my part. How is it?-You are a tiger. Come. You stop there. You tell the truth and go.-What truth? Are you buying us liquor and staying with us just because you want a model for your show? O brother, you asked me that at least now. Your guess is right. Even you could understand, why can't she understand. Then I don't like to follow her and say 'I like you, I like you' like some young boys. Then, there should be reason to follow her. That's why you wicked designer! Wicked designer! The cock is crowing. The lovers come and get in. Central Don't you like me Don't you like me In your heart, don't you like me? Tell me, don't you like me My dear friend, my dear friend We are alone in the nest Won't you say anything? Central Above the silver clouds... when the moonlight peeps out from above the silver clouds, kisses the jasmine and gets sweetness My heart beats hard to cover you with new snow Slowly the hands of memory... Slowly the hands of memory welcome you When the song of night rains down And when the moss of dreams recline When the small whispers come to my ears close my eyes without anyone seeing Central If there is a heaven on earth, it is this, it is this. If it is not this, what else is that? We have not yet entered. Before that you've started drooling. Hey, haven't you seen ladies. - Yes. But not like these. I'll tell you one thing. If you show any rowdyism, I'll kick and throw you all out. AS if. You've reached. We expected a van full of artists. More vans are coming at the back. He?-Yes he is the best director. He is not like he seems He's a gifted artist. A talented person. The matter is alight. First you send him off. First Femina, now drama. Anyone will doubt. Don't I have any other work. We also asked. What can I do if his mother compelled me? I must work with Nandana. I give word that we won't speak a word about Femina show until the youth festival is over. If you don't believe me still, you show me your hand.-Why? For Give promise. To promise I've read in Sanskrit, "Touching is sin, looking is purity". This is a bad place. All of you must take care of yourselves. We're all young. If the leaf falls on the thorn, or the thorn falls on the leaf, the damage is to the thorn. Its point will be broken. What's the confusion there? Ijust told a general proverb. You know that this is a place where five girls raped and killed a seventeen year old milk boy. - Leave me. Don't spoil me. My chastity. Think of me as a brother. Hey, stop there. What?-I've a doubt. Who's supplying milk to the hostel? Why do you want to know? - I want to do that. I've read in the papers that it is very profitable. 'Milma' Get down, get down, we've reached. - All of you take your luggage. Kathakali, drum, mridangam, 'Thiruvathira'! Don't leave my hand, mother. You'll fall and break. There is nothing more to break. Goat, flute shady flowering trees and fragrance flowers and your flute. I'll remember.-Not up to the mark. I'll think of your flute song. Not like that girl. I'll think of your flute song. - This is more boring. If she improves acting, she can act in serials. This is the moment when Ramanan and Chandrika are going to separate. You tell it with feeling. - Don't feel badly. Girl, you look at me. I'll show you. The goat, medicine, coconut leaves of flowering trees and your Venu Nagavalli will keep on wiping their heads-Go. This is not my own. This is in the script. This is like a prescription. Aren't you the script writer?-Yes. The script is not good. - You go and sit there. Don't you want all those in the drama? O beautiful girl with the fragrance of flowers Today your lover came and gave sweet." Look at that Yellow dress girl. Hello. Are you looking at the girls. No we are doing Thiruvathira dance. - Carry on. Carry on. Girl you first learn the dialogue. Where? If you see the dialogue roughly, then... Hai Annamma. I'll make you mine when the month of August comes." We thought you'll be in house arrest now that you are engaged. As if I'll elope with somebody? Even if you elope, we won't blame you. Oh, you've brought him also. Not that I have time. Then when everyone forced me, We're doing the drama, because Annamma is there. Pappa tell her that dialogue. Stop, stop. I've a dialogue with Shyam before the drama starts. Should we go? - No, we'll go. Come brother. What, did you bite a chilly? - No, I got a sudden idea. Iam sure it won't be a good idea, he is not so sensible. Hai Naomi, you said you want to tell something. If you tease me, I'll complain. Shyam, did you see Manuel? Ann, we'll talk later. There rehearsel... Did you see Manuel? Yes.- What did you say? That we're in love. ls it? When did it start? Hey idiot, I told that to save you. I felt like saying that when I heard that they're proceeding with a marriage which you don't like. Did I tell you that I don't like him. When you are interfering in my matters, at least I should know that. Oh, sorry, it was a mistake. I will go and tell that man that this was a lie. ls it enough? Speak decently. He is the man I'm going to marry. He has a good name. Manuel. If you want you call him Manu. One Manuel and one Automatic. Her... Hey you are an idiot, she asked you because she wanted to hear from you that you love her. Then you play like thisl- is it? I didn't understand at all. I'll make her alright at once.- Okay. Come, come. We'll see. Let me learn this dialogue.- No. We ant a heroine who looks like a girl. All these years we did drama without gents. That's why you brought here basketfuls of championships. You don't bring in basket, bring at least in a coconut shell. Then you tell.- Tell what's the matter. Both have started again.- It's not that. She won't be apt. The chemistry between the hero and the heroine should work out. Nandu, you come here.- Don't hold her hand. Oh, a chemistry and physics. Isn't he Richard Gear? I'm not gear, I'm break.- Stop it. As if they are small children we'll see. Both of them have a disease. We thought that they fell in love by fight as we see in cinema. Now they've started again. I have deep love for him. You tell him and arrange. Her disease is that only. In this flute, through which my breath has gone out, no song is left. Chandrika, come on, in the night of deep longing. Oh, what an acting. She's Bahuleyan's daughter only. She's not feeling anything. Keep your hand here. In this night of deep longing, Central Chandrika,- shall I tell you one thing. Oh God, these are all not in the scene. Nandu, learn that dialogue well. - I'll teach her. If you want to hold her tightly, you see some other heroine. Not her. Nandu, come here. Susamma, Nandu is good. A feeling is there when we act love. We'll feel as if a girl is talking. That is the heroine. You think that one will become a heroine only if she drops her head, draws a map of Africa with her feet and talk some sweet nothing. Poor thing. The heroine has not got the bus from the fourth century. Whatever be the century love is sweet nothingness, isn't it Shyam? Then what? How is the rehearsal going on? Nandu, no, Nandana is studying the dialogue. Is Nandana is also in the drama? Now Nandana is the heroine Ma'am. What happened to Ann? We compelled her many times. But Ann is not willing. Shyam's acting is not good enough. His inner feelings are not coming out. For that only, there is rehearsal. I'm substitute till they stop fighting. Have they started again. Stop your fight and start the rehearsal soon. Shall we tell a dialogue like that in the climax. It'll be good. You see, I told you. But not in this. - It is his idea. Shyam. Who is this? - He's your future father-in-law. Uncle, why have you come here? I've come to see you. Sit for five minutes. Then you go. We'll come. - Okay. He should not be here. - Uncle, I'll stand here. What Uncle? - See this. What is Uncle doing? - Now I'm sitting here. Uncle this is just a drama rehearsal. I'm not asking for any explanation. You are smart. Very smart. My daughter is also smart. Like my elder children. Uncle somebody is doing this to make you misunderstand. Who are you? - I'm Shyam's friend. You keep quiet for some time. Let me finish talking. What have you decided? To elope and register the marriage or to tie the knot decently? What do you prefer Uncle? - I don't prefer anything. I don't think there will be a decision in your case by discussing or threatening. So what shall we do? Shouldn't we have a decision? You see there. How? You're going out? If they enter here, Why should there be a disturbance for them? Do whatever you want. Hey what are you doing? - You see. You stand here and see. Take the vehicle, Surendra. I can't be a witness. Hey brothers stay there. I'll come there. Central Shyam, what happened? This is the prize I got for your photography skills. From her father. Such crookedness in your mind. Leave alone my matter. Did you think about her? Why did you do this? To win? I've only enjoyed the fighting and quarreling with you. Because I liked it. Because I really loved you. I told them like that. Oh, what a girl to fall in love with for the first time. It was a mistake. Enough. I stopped. Everything is over. Did I do this to you, me? Yes. I did this. I did this not only to win, but also to see you beaten. Did you get enough? ls it enough? Shyam, what is this? Still she's arrogant. I entered the stage just to make you angry. But you... - I shouldn't see you before me. You are with me for many years. Did you think that I'll do such a foul play? You can think like that. I don't have the mind to prove that it is not. Do you know, I made a bet with Mathews that it's not enough ifl love you, but should make you tell that you love me. It's my fault that I thought we're of the same wavelength and all. Enough. We'll stop it like this. You shouldn't have slapped her. - Indeed it happened. Let her reduce one beating from what she'll get after marriage. Mathews, our bet is over. You lost. Today Shyam said in front of everyone that he loves me.Yes, true. But, what you said is true. This is a passing fancy. Leave it. Mathews, we'll leave it. Central The lotus and the sun are silent today also... The lotus and the sun are silent today also... Are the eyes red due to grief or separation? Is it smile or anger in the unfolding small lips? The lotus and the sun are silent today also... Central When the valleys are covered with new snow Did you see her standing afar, alone with love? Will the light of embers disappear from the eyes of hostility? Will a new drop of honey become a libation? And the molten day of summer cool down. The lotus and the sun are silent today also... The lotus and the sun are silent today also... Hanuman, the son of the wind God." Did you see Shyam? - I didn't see. Ifyou get him, you beat him in such a way that he can't be stitched together. Central When Hanuman is entering Lanka in quest of Sita", What does this man want among the ladies? An experience of touching if he's lucky. Shame. Where did we stop? When that Kathakali man comes down from the stage, you give him also. Where is Shyam? I can't get him on the phone. If you don't get him, you write a letter. Don'tjoke. - He went to the hotel. Please will you come with me? Sorry. I'm wholly responsible for this. I can't even move from here without completing this. What? What is the matter? - Ask her. Is it not enough for you? What Nandu! - Father! Where? - He has come with some men. There. If they see you... - what's the matter? He got some more photos. Mother had called me. Is your father mad? You move. - No. We'll sit here. If you go in front of him, I know... that's why. I had given him once. One sample. Then he became stubborn. He wants to make his mother cry. Let it be. You must bring up children by beating them. Othenlvise the people will beat them. My dear Uncle, it is not like you think. There is nothing between Shyam and Nandana. They are good friends. - Pah! Are you the one who knows that? No. You know. Tell me. Where are they? - Hey, I don't know. Hey, mister, what are you showing? No madam, I've not shown anything. I'm only going to show. Tell me. - I don't know. Nandana has gone to the hotel. To See Shyam. Is it so? So the children have started living together without the elders knowing. Come. Nandu, your father knows this place. If they don't see me there, they will come here only. Come. They've come. I'm local S.l. Who is that? My friend. Madam, who is that? Friend. I got an information of immoral trafficking. Shall we come in? If we get such an information, is it possible for us not to come? Ok. Friends from where are you? We're students of St. Mary's college. - We?! Oh, you're the hero? You have taken room here, for one or two weeks, that too three. Good. A permanent set up is good. Joseph, search here. We may get a video camera or a cassette if we are lucky. We'll know the new taste. If you speak vulgar... Trying to act smart with a Policeman. Put here in the jeep. Sir you take me if you want. You are manhandling the police? Leave her alone. You get in. You come with us How dare you beat Policemen? Go Enough of your speech. I've crossed your age. I know, - you don't know anything. When they get old everyone will get irritated when they see fresh boys and girls. If we close the door, immoral trafficking. If we touch each other American culture ...Problem of internet. They have made a morality code. Don't put your bad thoughts on our head. Son, enough of your speech, off your mike. If it's not enough, you beat me. I'll take it. Anyway you've brought me here with difficulty. Then what do you want me to do? Come to your room and give guard of honour? Or to serve your popcorn and pizza. That's not the rule. What you saw now is the rule? Are you following the rule now? If that is so, if a boy and a boy or a girl and a girl, sit in a same room, will you take action for homosexuality? - Son of a bitch. Sir. We had taken the rooms for the artists and their things for the programme. We had come to take the costumes from there. I'm the Chairman of that college. My mother is a teacher there. From where was that information? Sir, it was a telephonic information, Name was not given. It was a female voice. As soon as you heard you decided that it was immoral trafficking. This sudden action is there when you get such information only. This is a disease. Hey, there are some yellowjournalists standing outside. Did you call them? - Hey, no Sir, Ok you go. - Shall we note down their name and address. Why? For any marriage proposal? I'll get you in my hand one day. I won't make you piss for three days. Move, move. You also gave father a prize. - Father - Go. When you defeated this ignorant man, you all are happy. Take her. With you. You decide the date and the auspicious time. I'll come and conduct. I'm a father, it's due to my wish to hand over my daughter. Improper behaviour under the guise of Youth festival" Father, I don't have anything to justify. The wrong doer is me. Take whatever action you want. But understand one thing. A news doesn't mean that it is true. Anjali, I don't have any worry. Only happiness. How can I teach students when I can't bring up my son? Let this resignation be an atonement. Did you see the photos? Let me see. I cook food for you twice a day, children. Oh, they are all dressed in these photos. See the photos. If your photos want to be published, you should kill somebody. The three of them were together. But the girl is only lucky. We knew it when they caught. Ann No... I'll pull out your tongue. Old woman. Are you not satisfied seeing this? You celebrate, come. - Ann, enough come. Without wasting time, you give a decision, teacher. If we want we can bring the registrar here today. What nonsense are you taking? I can take only action for misconduct as they are students of this college. A suspension or a dismissal. Not conducting marriages. You can make history if you want. - Yes. Bahuleyan, you decided that they were in love, you come to kill them with sword and all. But you should have tried to know the truth. Till this moment, did any of you enquire, what Shyam and Nandana have to tell? We know that a girl had informed the police. Who is she? I'm his mother. One thing is certain. Because of my son, this girl's life will not be ruined. If it is marriage, marriage. lfl am alive. Before you all decide the date and time all of you see this. It is Preetha's laptop. It was she who took photos and send to uncle during the rehearsal and also informed the police. Central What do the guardians have to say now? Do you realise now at least that the problem is not because a boy has come. Whether boy or girl, you must have trust in your children. Then all are going to clap hands and go after clearing the misunderstanding. What should I do with my daughter? Should lthrow her in a well and kill her, I promise on my dead mother that if you try to leave her, I'll make you marry her, even if it is after breaking your hand. There are difficulties for that Uncle. Because first he has to divorce the wife that means your daughter. If he has to divorce his wife, you must first break his limbs and make him sign. If that is your decision, we can't stand folding our hands. Hey Ranju, I won't see that he is your father-in-law or her father. I've just signed at the registrar office. She said that if she has to come with me, father has to hand over her. Go and fall at his feet. Do I have to say specially? Fall at my feet. Son, do you have anyjob? - He is very good designer. Uncle haven't you heard Vivaldi? - As if Vivaldi So it was you who was the cause. The voltage is low for your laughter. The laughter of man who comes caught in a raid will have only this voltage. Oh, you are worried that all have misunderstood you. Oh leave it. What is our next programme? The next programme is drama. After that prize distribution. But before that must not we end our drama? Isn't that a flop drama? The curtain was drawn in the middle, - Ann now... Shyam, no need of any confession or compromising. That stage is over. Didn't you believe that I had done all this. Enough. You've proved that you are not able to understand me. I can't experiment once more and fail. Ramana and Chandrika are separating during this night of after thoughts. Let Ramanan come. - Call Shyam Where is Ramanan? - Which Ramanan? Where is Shyam? - Oh! Shyam. I don't know. Where is he, go. - He'll come now. Where is Shyam? He will come - When will he come? Chandrika is waiting to say good bye, remembering again and again the happy days of eternal love. Ramanan has not gone anywhere. He is somewhere around. Because he was here here before sometime. Please adjust Go and stand there. He can hear clearly her heart throbbing from far. Ramana, Ramana, Where have you gone? There is no time. Mohini dancer, Mohini dancer... Have you seen our Ramanan? Get lost. Here Ramana is lying flat after drinking liquor. Ramana, Chandrika is waiting for you there. Iam not Ramanan.You are Ramanan. You get up. Take that flute. There is nothing in it. Then how can I take full? Not full. Flute. - Oh Flute. Come to the stage. Drama has started. Oh Drama has started? I'll do my part now. Hey. Stage is not there. Here. Hey, dancers, do you know the way to the stage?- What? He'll not allow his Chandrika suffer the pangs of separation for a long time. Hello give way brother. Iam coming. Ramanan has reached Knowing with the sixth sense that he is going to lose his Chandrika he is coming. May be that's why his legs are shaking. Tell the dialogue. Give that broken vessel, no flute. Give that broken flute. - What ifl don't? Oh! That is not in the script. I'll keep it safe. I'll be careful. You must be careful. At the time of parting after a break in love, All girls like you must be careful. Oh! Everything is in a mess. Ann, Continue... continue... You mistook my friendship for love. It is your fault. - No that is your fault. You acted your love as friendship. I've come to give you the best actress award for that. Don't punish me with suicide. - Not with suicide One must punish such girls with a whip. Hey Chandrika daughter of Mathews from Changanacherry What do you think? If you say goodbye and go this Ramanan will hang on a rope. That is in olden days. Clap silently. Applausing! Yes. If a knot falls on my neck now, you'll hang on the other end. If I've to die, we'll die together. If I've to live...What. If I've to live? - Live together... Tell me Chandrika, you want to live or die? Tell. The stage is in a muddle. Pull down the curtain. If you pull down the curtain, I'll kick you. Come here, don't create a scene. Don't do anything! Leave me, I won't do anything. - Everything is over. But she should tell in front of everyone that she didn't love me. And that she'll live happily even after separation from me. See, she can't tell that. I committed a mistake, for that I'm ready to ask forgiveness. Even many times. But due to that mistake which I did unknowingly lam not ready to consider the girl I love as a sister. All of you must forgive me. Hey, I am taking you with me to graze goats in the shady forest. Keep quiet. - Leave me. Leave me... This is the first time my drama is getting applause at the end.
