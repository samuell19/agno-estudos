TOHOKU CINEQUANON SDP Hit it! Hit it! Hit it! Hit it! Hit it! Hit it! Hit it! Hit it! Hit it! Come on! The sky is blue The curve on this ball Is like that of shattered dreams LOVE IS FIVE-SEVEN-FIVE! Let's save Matsuo School! We need your support! We are against the closing of the school! Please support us! Please support us! Please take it. Shove it up your ass. Don't you care if our school gets closed?! - Please support us! - So... Haiku evolved out of haikai. Haiku quickly became a separate genre. Poet Masaoka Shiki... ...departed from the original haiku... Could you be a little quieter? - Takada-sensei! - Yes? I can't bear this. When I look at how these kids are trying to save the school... ...I feel such enormous pain. I thought our baseball team would do well... ...but it turned out I was wrong. There are still two years left until the closing. Let's show everyone that we're worth something. Well... Don't give in to despair. Try to stay positive. OK. I'd like you to take part in this. HAIKU CONTEST Haiku contest? And the name That you make for yourself Is like a cloud That's not bad. But... Amakawa-sensei! Amakawa-sensei! Please take care of it. I want to talk to you before the training begins. The baseball tournament was really good. You all did a great job. Unfortunately our baseball team lost, but tomorrow we have to support our football team. Let's help our school make history! Yes! I can't hear you! Yes!!! Utsumi-san, stay. - You know, Utsumi-san... - What? There have been complaints. The players are saying that you distract them and they can't focus. So, as hard as it is for me to say this... ...but you're out. Sorry. I'm really sorry. Your giant boobs are so wobbly! What do you want? Get out of my way. Who do you think you're talking to? Take this! Awesome! I'm in love. Why?! Assholes! This is how you want the world to remember you? They will you if you end your life now. I want to be reborn As a ghost Like in magic tales What? Wow! That's really dramatic. My haiku? Go out with a haiku. I should do the same when it's my time to die. Here. It was hard checking your work. Apart from your name, everything is written in hiragana. If you stay in Japan not knowing the hieroglyphs is going to be a problem. Not at all. You can easily replace it with hieroglyphs in an email! - Really? - Yes. Here's something for you to read over the holidays. I don't know the hieroglyphs, but I speak English very well. Maybe you could give me a pass without it? I'd be happy to, but I can't. Besides, I don't want other teachers to frown at me. This Japanese mentality! You people are so stubborn. I see you're very critical of our culture. It's not about being critical. All the boys are so dumb and unattractive. I think it isn't very good that you notice only bad things about Japan. You don't seem to notice the Japanese spirit. The spirit? Here! Which one do you choose? Tsuchiyama-kun is the head of the Takada photography club. The meeting is starting. Are you coming? Sure! I thought I was the only one in the club. Three people, then. I'm glad you came. For certain reasons, the photography club will become the haiku club. From now on. What? I'd like to join the club. Haiku... ...consists of 17 syllables that are divided in three lines like this: 5-7-5. Each line has a deeper meaning. Who cares? What are we going to do? Oh yes, excuse me. For three days, starting from August 13... ...in Matsuma Himeken prefecture... ...will be taking place a haiku contest. But August is holidays. Give me a break. Well... In the contest, two teams of five people each compete with each other. One is red and the other is white. They take turns to read their haikus. After that, they are given 3 minutes for comments or questions. Excuse me, Takada-san! Is it possible to take part with less than five people? Well, no... One, two, three, four... Won't do. Bye. Wait! - What? - I want to take part! But there are only four of us. But I really want to take part! I have tried so many times... ...but I never got accepted! They keep crushing my dreams! Or maybe you just don't know how to write haiku. Now what? I want to take part too! Wow... And what about you? Me... well... Open your eyes! Haiku sucks! It's for old people! It's totally not cool. Why haiku?! Haiku doesn't suck. Quite the contrary... ...haiku rocks! Your dumb face isn't convincing at all. Dumb face? Whatever. Here you are! Senpai! From now, I'll be following you everywhere, Haruko-senpai! What? What are you all doing here? Haiku. Haiku as in Hiking? No, that's not it. Doesn't matter! I'll go anywhere Haruko-senpai goes! You're right on time. Yes... Hey, Pochiko! Hey, Pochiko! Pochiko! Grandpa, Pochiko died two years ago. That's right. I'm taking part in a contest. As a pitcher? It's a haiku contest. I swing my bat Green summer grass Covers the pitch Pochiko! Move. Move! Yu-chan! Turn this way! Alright. Why did you join the haiku club? Because Tsuchiyama-kun said my last words were good. Your last words? My farewell haiku. Farewell haiku? At that point. But everything changed. I will play The lap guitar In our club! Ta-da-dam! Pi-chan, that's not haiku. It's just a song done in 5-7-5. But it's cute, isn't it? It's not that simple. Let me teach you the rules. Rules? Is there anything to teach? First of all, you have to include seasonal words. What are those? Those are words indicating seasons. To give you a simple example... ...sakura indicates spring. A handkerchief indicates summer. The moon indicates autumn. That's lame! No shit. That's what I told you yesterday. Also there are cutting words. What are those? Do you know? - What? - What are cutting words? Who are the words cutting? Tsuchiyama-kun, do you know? Know what? - Cutting words. - Cutting who? What are all of you even doing here? - Look what I've got! - Great! Teacher, tell us about cutting words. Cutting words? Of course. Cutting words are... ...for example 'and' or 'if'. To give some examples from well-known haikus... The old pond â€” A frog leaps in And a splash 'And' is the cutting word here. If it was 'In the old pond'... Well that doesn't fit, but... In short, a cutting word is a word that separates one feeling from another... ...and helps convey the author's intention. I see! So it's better to say 'And the old pond' than 'In the old pond! Yes. You can almost see it, can't you? Even if we know the theory, how do we go about it from there? Still haiku sucks ass. Not at all. Haiku is the coolest. Your dumb face isn't convincing at all. Stop calling my face dumb. Dumbface Is now your nickname That's it! Ta-da-dam! 'That's it' is the cutting word here! This is not very reassuring. Let's deal with the details later. And now let's just try to write a haiku together. What's the topic? A lemon. OK! Lemons are falling down Like rainfall It hurts What are you up to?! I'm writing a haiku. Any good ideas? What a load of crap. Haruko-senpai! What the hell!? Stop it! Cut it out! Wait! You saw it just now. You certainly saw it, right? I didn't. Liar. Yes, I'm a liar. When I came home that night... ...I fantasized and jerked off. I couldn't help myself. I love good literature, stray cats in my neighbourhood... ...strong emotions... ...and Haruko Takayama. Haruko Takayama. I love Haruko Takayama. No, not like that. It was supposed to be a haiku about lemons. I'm sorry, Haru-chan. Throwing a lemon up Aiming at the sky I think That I'm making art It used to be that one person wrote a haiku in 5-7-5. And then another continued it in 7-7. Liar! Eventually only the original "5-7-5" foot was left. That's when the modern haiku was born. Anyway, you have to choose a topic for yourselves. I'd like you to write a haiku with a hidden meaning. With a hidden meaning? Very well! Sitting on the toilet I hear the sound Of lemon juice being poured. Ta-da-dam! And where's the hidden meaning? - Let me try! - Go ahead! Wind blowing outside The smell of lemons This must be love I liked the beginning. Can I? I'm hurt The lemon of my soul Was gnawed on And what does that mean? It's about my feelings. You hurt me when you said my face was dumb. I see! What do you got, Haruko-senpai? I don't want to. But you took the lemon! Come on! Fine. The sky is so high I throw a lemon up During the recess Not bad. The color of the sky is opposite to the color of a lemon. Good choice. Really? Tsuchiyama-kun, your turn. Well... Hurry up! Well... Hurry up! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! - Hurry! Hurry! - Listen... I couldn't sleep last night. So, I didn't write anything. That's unfair! Today, I'd like you to look for inspiration. Inspiration? In other words, I want you to look around and write a haiku based on what you see. Well, let's begin. Doesn't this bore you? What exactly? Writing haiku all day long. What's wrong about that? It's just lame. Football players train all day too. They have to train, they have no choice. But I can live without haiku just fine. How is it going? In progress. Any problems? No. Over here! Admit it, everything looks different now. We're heading home Thinking about the sea That's always by our side I keep on walking! Where will this road Lead me I wonder? Not bad. When you're reading or writing a haiku... ...you are in dialogue with nature. The dialogue which is the extension of the landscape around you. The whole word stretching from here to there... ...suddenly starts to bloom. Well, good luck to you! What happened? A strange old man was just talking to us. A strange old man? Pochiko! Pochiko! Summer breeze I keep looking forward And running away Have you heard the rumors about Mako Utsumi? What rumors? She joined the haiku club. Haiku? That same haiku? - That we were told about? - Right. - Yes. - This must be a joke. She must have lost her mind after being kicked out of cheerleaders. No one kicked her out. Guys just complained about her. Still, it's good that she left. She was bringing everyone down. But why haiku? She must have realized she wasn't good enough to be one of us. I hate it when people are gossiping about someone behind their back. - You're stupid bitches. - What? Ones like you give Japanese women a bad name. Think before you say something, you ugly gals. Did you just call us ugly? I did. Hold it! I heard you joined the club too. Is that true? - Well... - That means yes? - What the hell?! - You all must be joking! Haiku is for old people! What's wrong with haiku? Haiku... Haiku... Haiku what? Haiku is a great art form. - Haiku... - Haiku what? Haiku... rocks! That guy Is a demon I'm possessed by him My sweet demon I'm a slave to his desires He struck me Right in my heart I'm frozen to the spot Ah, baby My sweet lil' baby My sweet demon My sweet demon My sweet demon That day, I stayed in school after classes. I was sitting on the roof and watching the schoolyard as usual. Haruko Takayama came out... ...and kicked a ball that someone had left behind. The ball hit a washbasin by the pitch. The tap broke and water gushed up. Under the sun rays, the fountain turned into a rainbow. When Haruko Takayama saw it, she burst out laughing. When I saw it... ...I had a boner. Since then, all my thoughts have been about Haruko Takayama. There was nothing I could do about it. Tsuchiyama-kun? May I come in? Tsuchiyama-kun What? Wow! This is beautiful! Did you take all of these yourself? Don't look! And even more here! - Not bad at all... - Don't look! This one is fantastic. And this girl here... Marvelous... You know. Maybe I'm wrong, but... ...I think photography and haiku are quite similar. If you can take a photo like that, you can write a haiku too. I know that. I know how you feel. Being in love can be painful. I understand that. Are you in love too, teacher? Well... I'm not in love... Who is she? - Nevermind! - It's okay, tell me! No, no! Good work today. Yoko-sensei! How are things in the haiku club? Well... We're doing our best. But it's too early to tell. I want to be more like Doraemon. Doraemon? In the 4th grade, we had a head teacher who reminded me of Doraemon. The likeness wasn't only physical. He gave us guidance in difficult situations. Kids in high school may look like adults... ...but, deep down, they're still kids, just like Nobita Nobi. That's very true. Is Haruko Takayama doing well? Yes. Good to hear that. Good luck, sensei! Yes! Ah, yes... Furuikei School where we're going now is last year's winner. Be nice to everyone. The old pond â€” A frog leaps in And a splash Pouring the hot day Into the sea Mogami River We want to be prepared well, so we need to practice. Am I right? Yes! Summer grass All that remains Of a Samuraiâ€™s dream Majestic mountains Above them only the blue dome Of the sky The old pond â€” A frog leaps in... Hello, Takada-kun. I'm glad you came. I'm sorry for the interruption. It's fine. How about it? Shall we compete in teams? No! That wouldn't be fair. Shall we improvise? Wait! What are you getting us into? Well, let's try to improvise. Right? Furuikei School can start. Raining out of the blue On a summer day The sky is high Raining out of the blue On a summer day The sky is high Matsuo High School, your turn. Raining out of the blue Only the sound of the wind Heralded it Raining out of the blue Only the sound of the wind Heralded it Matsuo High School, your comments about Furuikei School's haiku. - May I? - Go ahead. I think that high sky looks beautiful. Very beautiful. Furuikei School, your questions about Matsuo High School's haiku. - May I? - Go ahead. All your haiku is saying is that the sound of the wind lets you know the rain is coming. And that's it. It has to convey some deeper meaning. Let's go on. Furuikei School, please proceed. Out of the blue Pouring down Over the Roppongi bridge Out of the blue Pouring down Over the Roppongi bridge Now, Matsuo School! Your turn, please. I'm sorry. It's all my fault. We still have a lot of time to practice before the contest. It's no use. I'm hopeless. Don't say that! I was on the baseball team for three years, but I was terrible at it. I was always sitting on the bench. And I've never performed in front of an audience. I decided to take part in the haiku contest... ...because I thought at least there I could be the best. But... Listen... Listen... Students of Furuikei School are great at haiku. But I don't think they enjoy their practice. I wouldn't like you to train like that. I want you to enjoy it. Otherwise, it doesn't make sense. You don't have to be able to recite poems well. But you have to recite them with pleasure. Haiku recited with pleasure gets the message across. You'll get your chance to perform in front of an audience. There's still a week left before the contest. Tsuchiyama-kun It's time you read your own haiku. I've had enough of this! What are you doing? Tsuchiyama, calm down! Your smile Is captured On the photo paper You're the one who makes those clouds, right? What clouds? I used to think that smoke became clouds rising up. That's why I thought smokers made clouds. I liked your haiku. I wrote it thinking about you. I... love... What did you just do? You sure you didn't do it? I did nothing! Liar! It's true. I'm a liar. When I came home that day, I thought about jerking off again. But then, I felt it would be wrong, so I decided not to do it. The summer sky Caught the glimpse Of my first kiss Here you go. What's the topic? Anything you want. Masuo-chan! We're out of paint. Can you bring some more? Of course. Right away. Tsuchiyama-kun, that's amazing! Here, here! Here you go! At last! Let's go home. Look what you have done! Why are you even here? To fool around? Sorry. I didn't mean it. Masuo-san! Why are you sitting here doing nothing? Others have already started preparing. Say, Masuo-san! Maybe if we really try, we can make it? Maybe. No way. There's no chance you can make it. - Well there is some... - No, there isn't. - Even a small one? - Not even a small one. - Even a tiny one? - Not even that. - Even a microscopic one? - No. - And... - Zero. In terms of both preparation and experience, we're on totally different levels. You're nothing like us. Just give up. Nakamura-kun, mind your manners. I apologize. Takada-kun, you've done a great job. Thank you. - Enjoying this cool evening? - Yes. - Good luck. - Thank you. - If you do your best, you have a chance. - Yes. Well, shall we go then? Yes! The old pond â€” A frog leaps in And a splash Pouring the hot day Into the sea Mogami River. Summer grass All that remains Of a Samuraiâ€™s dream They get on my nerves! What arrogant pricks! Exactly! Shall we begin? What's going on here? FIRST ROUND Let the 12th national haiku contest begin! First round. Group F. Red team - Yojin High School. White team - Matsuo High School. Red team, please begin. In the shade of hydrangeas I roam around Alone in the universe In the shade of hydrangeas I roam around Alone in the universe Oh, hydrangeas I'm not the person I was yesterday Oh, hydrangeas I'm not the person I was yesterday White team, your comments. Well... How should I put it... Comparing hydranges... ...with the universe... That seems a bit far-fetched. Don't you think? - May I? - May I? The word "hydrangea" has an "a" at the end. And she said "hydrange". Isn't that a childish mistake? Judges, your decision! White team, your haiku! Is anything wrong? White team! Your haiku! Oh, hydrangea The rain follows you My love Oh, hydrangea The rain follows you My love Red team! Your haiku! I admire The beauty of lines About hydrangeas I admire The beauty of lines About hydrangeas White team! Your comments! Judges, your decision! When leaving the garden I cover the hydrangea With black and white When leaving the garden I cover the hydrangea With black and white Enough! Judges, your decision! Yes! A little bird Comes to sing with me The lap guitar A little bird Comes to sing with me The lap guitar SECOND ROUND It was the day That I remembered For the bird's song It was the day That I remembered For the bird's song I don't see the connection... ...between "bird" and "song". The ascending intonation... ...is meant to do that. Judges, your decision! Reaching us A little bird Alighted on the cross Reaching us A little bird Alighted on the cross A little bird Alighted on My aching heart A little bird Alighted on My aching heart The reference to your heart seems a bit out of place in the haiku. Well... Judges, your decision! The winner is Kirishu High School! Furuikei School is through to the next round. Let me congratulate you on reaching the next stage. It was inevitable. Inevitable. You're probably expecting to win the contest again. Of course. Of course. I'm sorry. It's all my fault. The old pond â€” A frog leaps in And a splash Pouring the hot day Into the sea Mogami River Summer grass All that remains Of a Samuraiâ€™s dream Majestic mountains Above them only the blue dome Of the sky That was a fantastic victory. Beating that kind of opponent was easy. Here. What's this? A consolation for the losers. Let's go for a walk around the town and think of haikus. If something catches your eye, just take a photo. Let's do our best. Enough already! Teacher! Let's just go home. It's useless right now. I'm tired. And I'm hungry. What are you talking about? Losing means nothing. But you have to keep trying. Otherwise, everything we've done was in vain. I'm going home. - Wait! - Leave me alone! - Hold on! - Utsumi-san! I said I'm going home! It's easy for you, Haruko. Haruko... Haruko... You're pretty. And slim! And you can write haikus too. But what about me? What about me? - Utsumi-san! - Masuo-chan, wait! Go get her. Why me? You still haven't understood? Understood what? Mako joined the club because she's in love with you! What? Go! Hurry! Takayama-san, haven't you understood yet? Understood what? That... ...I keep on practicing haiku only because of you! Hold your horses! Me, Pi-chan... ...I love Haruko-senpai! Pi-chan, when I first saw you I thought you were gorgeous! Since we're on it, I love Yoko-sensei! Shut up! Have you lost your minds? Utsumi-san! What do you think you're doing? Take it easy! I'm coming! Stay away! I told you to leave me alone! I'm glad I joined the haiku club. But I don't care anymore. We're hopeless. Hopeless. Only a miracle can save us! Is that all you have to say to the world? Is that all? What? Is that all you have to say to the world? Even I have something to say! I want to be reborn As a ghost Like in magic tales Tsuchiyama-kun... Tsuchiyama-kun... Was it too dramatic? Me... ...I had fun! At first, when I joined the club, I was bored to death. And I thought haiku was lame. We've never believed in ourselves... ...but we had fun didn't we? Even if these are our last lines... ...I really want to... ...us to write them together! CONTEST AMONG THE LOSERS In the temple of Matsuyama In the west of the city There's summer all year round In the temple of Matsuyama In the west of the city There's summer all year round It was our first visit to the temple... ...but we think it hasn't changed since ancient times. Power could be felt inside. Seigei High School is next. We look around. And admire The colors of summer Let's go. We look around. And admire The colors of summer We just want to finish and go home. That's how we feel. Matsuo High School is next. The sunflower Like us Has a story to tell The sunflower Like us Has a story to tell You know... I... I thought that haiku was not cool. But now I wonder if there's anything that can't be expressed in 17 syllables? I think the structure of haiku is beautiful. Our smiles are like sunflowers, aren't they? Writing our last haiku together... ...was a lot of fun. The time has come to reflect on what we heard... ...and choose the team that will go through to the next round. All of you were good. There were a lot of haikus, so it was hard to choose one team. But we'd like to single out a team that chose a great photo... ...and wrote a harmonious haiku. It's Matsuo High School. No way! We did it! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! We did it! SEMI-FINAL This is 12th national haiku contest. Second semi-final. Red team - Furuikei High School. White team - Matsuo High School. Red team, you're first. Bells in the wind The fourth volume Of Masaoka Shiki's works Bells in the wind The fourth volume Of Masaoka Shiki's works White team, your turn. Face against the sun My white shirt Is blowing in the wind Face against the sun My white shirt Is blowing in the wind White team, your comments please. What's wrong, Matsuo High School? I have a question! Well... How many volumes are there in Shiki's complete works? There are 22 volumes. Doraemon has 45 volumes! Pi-chan! Well... Concerning the fourth volume... ...I'm not sure if such a controversial number* is a good choice. *In Japan 4 is the number of death. References to Shiki-sensei's works are a must in haiku. And admiring the sound of bells... ...is a beautiful tradition. It's sad that you're comparing it with "Doraemon". Red team, your comments please. - May I? - May I? Your haiku doesn't follow the traditional rhythm. I think it fails to create the intended effect. Well... erm... I think... Doesn't the 'sigh of wind' feel better with that kind of rhythm? Not at all. Following the right rhythm... ...is necessary for beginners like you. Well... I used to be on a baseball team, even though I was mostly on the bench. But I did play for the team once. When you miss and then get in position again, you feel a gust of wind. I still remember that moment! Judges, your decision! Red team - 4 points. White team - 3 points. The winner is Furuikei High School. Furuikei High School is ahead. White team, your next haiku. Breathing in The summer breeze I play the lap guitar Breathing in The summer breeze I play the lap guitar Red team, your haiku please. An air balloon Brings comfort To the sky An air balloon Brings comfort To the sky Your comments, please. Your haiku doesn't have any deeper meaning. It's very immature indeed. I recited it in such a way as to suggest light wind resembling of music. I really like the lap guitar and play it very well. What? Do you want to hear it? Pi-chan! Pi-chan! Pi-chan, stop it! Enough! Your comments now. An air balloon brings... Comfort. Comfort? Is that a haiku at all? What? Haven't you heard about the free-verse haiku? You don't know that you can leave blank lines? A wandering poet looking at beautiful landscapes... ...didn't try to fit what he felt in 5-7-5. He expressed himself freely. The balloon flew away. Someone lost it. But it also brought the sky a mysterious feeling. It's both beautiful and painful. Don't you understand? I think I kinda got it. Judges, your decision! Red team - 6 points. White team - 1 point. The winner is Furuikei High School. Second round. Red team, your next haiku. Silver grass Warns us Of gale and storm Silver grass Warns us Of gale and storm White team, now your haiku. Through tears Of unrequited love The smell of wind Through tears Of unrequited love The smell of wind White team, your comments. I have a question. Silver grass... ...is supposed to evoke grass swaying in the wind, right? But the hieroglyph! What about it? The hieroglyphs "gale" and "storm" are very similar! So what? Well... Actually... It seems like you just added one more similar word! The fact that "storm" comes after "gale"... ...means that the wind is getting stronger! Red team, your comments. I have a question! The topic of unrequited love is chosen when one has nothing else to say. This is a haiku about my unrequited love. I was really hurting and crying. But I knew that I had to come here. If you only talk about your own personal experience and don't give others the chance to feel it... ...there's no point in writing a haiku. What do you know about it? Maybe I'm wrong, but... ...the smell of wind when you're crying... ...a cool breeze, and the sky over your head... I think everyone has felt that. Everyone, but not them. This round will decide whether Furuikei High School goes through. Judges, your decision! White team - 4 points. Red team - 3 points! Matsuo High School wins! Yoko-sensei! Matsuo School won. White team, you're first. A notebook To practice hiragana And a summer hat A notebook To practice hiragana And a summer hat Red team, your haiku! Yielding to blue bamboo Black wind Recedes Yielding to blue bamboo Black wind Recedes A question! I don't think a notebook for practicing hiragana conveys any deeper meaning. A note-book to practice hiragana. Not notebook but note-book. A "notebook" refers to something practical. But a "note-book" brings a lot of memories. A summer breeze. Rustling of pages. Someone ran past on the grass... ...and lost their white hat. The author is in love... ...with the owner of this hat. Doesn't that make your chest flutter? A note-book to practice hiragana... ...brings back memories of primary school. As for love, I don't know what kind of image that conveys. You guys don't understand anything! White team, your comments. I think that your juxtaposition of blue and black is very beautiful. And what does the black wind mean? It's the wind on a cloudy day of the rainy season. The topic of this haiku is the suffering of wet things things meant to protect you from the rain. Why? Why are you always writing about suffering? What? - Don't you enjoy it? - What? - You're like old people! - What? And it seems like you've never felt it yourselves! I think you just can't enjoy a full life. What did you say?! Masuo-chan told us... ...that haiku is pointless if you don't enjoy it. - But...! - Enough! Judges your decision! Matsuo School wins! Yes! We'll have one more round! The last round! Red team, you're first! Wind and snow inhabit The ruins of the old castle This spring Wind and snow inhabit The ruins of the old castle This spring In southern wind The true me Jumps for joy In southern wind The true me Jumps for joy The time is over. Judges! Your decision! White team - 7 points. The winner is Matsuo High School! We won! We did it! You did it! You did it! Yoko-sensei! I used to think that trying hard wasn't cool. Hey, Pochiko! Pochiko! Pochiko! Pochiko! There you are! I've been looking for you, Pochiko! I really have. Autumn morning Old man I'm walking along the shore Carrying a cat in my arms 12th haiku contest.
