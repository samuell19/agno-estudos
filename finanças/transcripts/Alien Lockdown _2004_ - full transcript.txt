Approximately 10,000 years before the Common Era, Near the dawn of civilization... A meteorite struck the earth. For many, it was a sign from angry gods preparing to punish a disobedient world. But for others... It was simply a mystery. In the meteor there was a stone.. The Morning Star. Legend of its existence grew. And those that believed claimed that the stone held mystical powers Not of this world. And the stone exchanged hands... Each new master believing they held the ultimate weapon against their enemies. And they were right. But the stone disappeared... Lost and buried in the sand for thousands of years until the very existence of it was erased from history... Except in the most ancient of texts. (African) What is it, Franklin? You got to see this. I don't know what to make of this at all. What the hell? It's the Ark Of Shadows. Dig it up. Put it up over here. Get me Woodman. Hello. Woodman. I'm here. We found the ark. Do you have the stone? It's inside. Is it okay? I'm looking at it right now. And? It's beautiful. Gentlemen, what you're about to see will forever revolutionize science in warfare. Evolution is a macabre journey with organisms relentlessly cannibalizing one another In the pursuit of survival. Arguably, we have remained at the top of the food chain for 40,000 years. Not anymore. Our DNA, our code, has over three billion symbols. Gentlemen, the specimen in front of you has over 40 billion. That's an amalgamation of the most resilient lifeforms on Earth, genetically engineered and grafted into one lifeform using new technology alien to our own. It's outer shell is like an armor. It is stronger than the most powerful steel, Able to resist thousands of pounds of pressure per square inch. Notice the soft tissue here. It's.. It's much like ours. It's vulnerable and weak. Yet when exposed to intense heat, or extreme cold, or traumatized, It's tissue thickens... Into a cyst-like shell. It's fierce, ravenous, virtually indestructible. While it's inside this facility here, It's impotent. Yet, if it were exposed to our environment, to our ecosystem.. Let's just say it could be the twilight of our existence. Gentlemen, if we could control this as a weapon, the mere threat of its introduction into the theater of war would bring nations to their knees. Hmm. What is this? What the hell are you up to, Woodman? Oh my God! I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. That was 26 hours ago. I understand that it's difficult to identify the assailant, but we actually think.. It's not human. Weapons division has been conducting some genetic experiments as an alternative to ground troops. Guess it was only a matter of time. I'm assuming this is off the books? The lab is a black hole facility located in a rocky mountain glacier. We chose this location because it's very close to the Earth's magnetic core. It scrambles G.P.S. your onsite radios should work, but they'll be twitchy. This is a lockdown, Commander. No one is allowed in, and no one is allowed out until the situation is normalized. How did you get the surveillance? We had a hard line. That's how we got the distress call. But someone cut it. Sabotage? We believe it to be Woodman. In his own words, he is the architect of this organism. You see, he... Believes that he's created perfection. I have downloaded his daily logs. Have a listen.. You'll get the picture. Are we bringing him in? Are we bringing in survivors? This is a clean-up operation. Everything stays in the hole. Now tell me, we are aware that you've been seeking employment in the private sector. You blame me? No, not since the Brisbane Operation, I don't. Why, you losing sleep too? You have no siblings, your parents are deceased, and you can't have children. Right, I have no one, no ties to anyone. It's why you chose me. That's why you were brought to my attention. You were chosen by a profile. Now they can dress it up with all the psycho B.S. that they want... But one thing is clear.. You are a predator, and you hate yourself for it. But that's exactly why you didn't hesitate in the Brisbane Operation, for which we are grateful. This is the last time. Duly noted. From the time of drop off to pick up you've got 16 hours. Judging by the time of the year And the elevation, it should be about 30 below. So once you're in.. We're in. Check. Go. Wind Resistance Five. Target point dead ahead. Systems clear. You want some help with that? No, I got it. New guy knows his stuff. I'm Temple. Green. Raymond Green. But my friends call me Red. Not that I ain't no redneck. I grew up on a peach farm, but that don't mean nothing. I've been around. Haiti... Somalia... I was in Baghdad when the sky lit up. Anyhow, you can call me Red if you want to. That's all right. I think we'll call you Green. Just relax. Why don't you tell us about that peach farm? Serious? All right then. It's in the Piedmont of the Carolinas, where the black dirt meets the red clay. It looks like unforgiving land. March 10th, 0600 hours. The vessel containing the code is six by six feet. Carbon Dating puts it at about 5,000 BC. No one will acknowledge this for what it truly is. They're afraid. I know and I'm not. It's an ark, and the code within it is life. I will give the ark, the code, its life. The question is, once I do, can I keep it in the shadows of this facility? 30 kliks to Drop Zone. No Bogeys on screen. Proceeding to target. That's affirmative. Stay low till drop, Maintain radio silence. Copy. Alpha Team is down. Beta Team in. Alpha Team clear. You're good to go. I copy. Beta, go ahead. Beta Team all clear. Proceed to target. Copy. Meyer, stay close. Go. Come on, let's go. Move! Go! It's coming up blank. We got nothing. Main computer's gotta be down. Emergency defenses are triggered. This building's airtight. Meyer, pull back. Kerns, check the ledge. No entrance here... Just dead bodies. With the main computer down, the security must've locked them out. Or freezing was a better alternative. Ventilation shaft, 30 or so meters down. We'll enter there. Temple, key in what you need. Communications could be touch and go. Good to go? I got no signal.. Too close to the pole. What is this place? We're gonna be experiencing a high degree of interference. This place is giving me the creeps. Me too. There's nothing so far. Kerns, how's our flank? All clear back here. Copy that. Come again? Meyer, your signal's not coming through. Talon, I'm not getting you. There's a lot of static. We're not getting any reception. There's no signal. I can't see my hand in front of my face. You got anything? No, I got nothing. It's all static. There's nothing. Something's jamming our signal. Still no signal. Radio's aren't working. There's a lot of static. This place is as black as an Alaskan Winter. Clear the lines! Kerns, cut the chatter. Keep the line clean. Copy that. Ventilators are at the center of the complex. Further down. Right... I want to stay upwind. I'll take point. That's a lot of ground to cover. Less than 16 hours. Take Beta Team, go to base. Ping every room as you work your way to the middle. We'll meet there. I'll track your map on my cad. We need a bird's-eye view of this place. Copy that. Temple, Kerns, you're up. Hoog, Monie, bring up the rear. Green, you're with me. Map it. We don't have all day, Temple. Hold on, hold on. Got it. Is Meyer in? Negative. Let's move! Level 13 clear. Temple, start mapping. Level 14, clear. Map it! I want as many nodes as we can afford on every level. Level 15, clear. Level 16, clear. I'll cover. Anybody getting this? All right, keep moving. Coming through. What the hell? Jesus! Green, check the body. He's been dead for less than an hour. Look at his face. Whatever killed him, killed him fast. My God, he's in pieces. What the.. Seems like we picked up something else. Stay alert. Move it! Alpha Team, fall in. We've got two lifeforms. Everybody on your toes. Who are you?! Charlie! Charlie Dreyfus. Dr. Woodman! Got him right here. Oh, thank God you guys got here. I thought nobody was gonna end up coming for us. They're not here to rescue us, Charlie. Clean-up? This is a clean-up. Oh God, please tell me this is not a clean-up. Easy. They managed to stay alive 37 hours. We just got here. Colonel said this was.. They might be useful. I.. I'm useful, very useful. In fact, the mainframe's down. I could get that up and running in time.. Three hours.. maybe. Can you do it or not? Yeah... Probably. I-I don't know, I mean... Everything's got a 4.5% margin of error, plus or minus, right? This whole thing is not my fault, okay? That guy, he smashed the computer, all right? He broke out. All the security codes.. shot. He wanted to see the thing feed. That true? Is he telling the truth? I refuse to answer that question. Especially... Since the man who said it is in purgatory. You can ask him yourself. Am I lying, Charlie? Some military criminals, They.. right to prison... But some go to places like this. If they have a talent. Code.. I write it, break it, I can do anything with it. I'm.. it's like... Whole program I just did on the mainframe? Work of art. Pure Picasso. Despite what you're thinking, you can trust me.. It's not like I killed anybody or anything. I don't care. What's your crime? He embezzled money... From a weapons contract... With the Pentagon. It was the... Wolf Tank Contract. I'm right, aren't I? I funneled like 1000th of a penny into an offshore account. Imagine my surprise when it, like, crossed 20 million bucks. Anyone else alive? How did you manage to stay alive this long? Commander, Meyer's in. Wait! There's more of you? Where is he? Where is he?! Beta Team on Sublevel 42. Talon, do you copy? Meyer, come in. Meyer? They gotta get back to the ventilator shaft. They just came from there. I know, they gotta get back and come up through the core. For Christ's sake, they gotta get outta there now! Radios don't work. Meyer and Beta Team on Sublevel 42, talon, come in! Meyer and Beta Team on Sublevel 42. It's gaining on us! Talon, come in. Commander, they're not alone. Go, go! Move! David, go! We're on. Charlie. Lead the way, Codebreaker. He doesn't move. Hey, move! Move. Just keep moving. Just keep moving. Run! Talon, do you copy? Talon, do you copy?! Six men down, one on the move. It's meyer. Access code to the elevator. You've got him. Oh no, not that! You're crazy. I'm not going to lose my right hand 'cause you're scared. Can I at least have a gun? Thank you.. Very much. This is our best bet. Freight elevators don't run off the mainframe electricity. They did that in case of an emergency, so I guess this counts, huh? Maybe they left that thing in the dust. Monie, go left. Kerns, go right. Going right. Clear! Now entering Level 16. Clearance approved. Keep moving. The elevator's close. Now entering level 10. Clearance approved. Access granted. Let's go! Now entering Sublevel 27. It's definitely down here, because I know for a fact.. Level 32. Clearance approved. Shoot it! Just shoot it! Keep shooting! Move! Move! Fall back! Come on, Meyer. I got you, come on. Get out, move, move! Cover! Get in! Talon, move. Talon, move! Come on! I don't know what's wrong with this thing, Man. I tried to get it to fire, it's not firing. It's like I'm going nuts. It's not firing. It's empty. I knew you'd come. Always. You son of a bitch! What the hell is that thing? Explosive-tipped ballistic bullets rip exit wounds the size of basketballs! We unload everything we've got, it's still alive. Then she's retreating. She's never been tested in this environment before. Combat, it's what she does. And she's showing cognitive skills.. small... But promising. And you, as a woman, you can appreciate Strength does not make a predator, But where and how you strike. We need answers. Well... It's not gonna matter. If I make it outta here, I'm still dead. We've lost six men in the last four hours. Pull back. This is a lockdown. You can unlock it. We've got no G.P.S. The chopper won't be back for another 12 hours. It's 30 below out there, you saw the bodies. We're locked down whether any of us like it or not. I don't see how we can engage this thing again. You won't need to. It will engage you. It's clear... So clear. This is a morality tale involving all of humanity. And you will be living out the first chapter. You better start making sense real fast and stop with all this philosophical B.S. after you've studied... Humanities and history and mathematics at the levels I have, There's no other explanation. This is light against darkness, right against wrong, good against evil! Only now... We are not dictating the rules! What the hell was that? Anybody see it? We've only mapped part of the complex. We got a lot of blind spots. Temple, come on, Man. I got nothing. We've got to get outta here. Go, Charlie, go! Temple, Green, don't lose him. Go! Go, move! Go, go! Now, move it! Kill it! Kill it! Get out, get the hell out of here! What was that? Come on, this way. In here! Kerns, move! Kerns, what do you see? I can't see Hoog and Monie. Talon, go! Move, move! Not without Hoog and Monie. Talon, go! Go, go! This is not good. Monie? You guys gotta understand something, and I don't think you want to hear it. If Colonel Anslow didn't send you down here to pick us up, then he sent you down here to die. We're here to kill that thing. I told you, it's impossible. Of course, unless you brought along a tactical nuke. You didn't happen to bring one with you, did you? I didn't think so. Pull back, stay by the main doors and get the airlift out. No, we can do it. Even if you could, say you kill it, There's gonna be a million more on its tail. Anslow knows this? Yeah, he pushed for it. He wanted us to make a million of them. He wants an army. And he's gonna get it. Talon, if he's telling the truth, We're gonna have a serious.. Then he's gonna have to prove it. Where is it? Bottom Complex. Kerns, open the door! No! Kerns, I said open the door right now! No, they're gone. Hoog! You can't save him! Hoog! Open the door, Kerns. We can't save him. Move, Kerns! No! There's nothing we could have done. Would you have left me out there? If you were out there, you'd be dead, you know? We're in here, it'll leave us alone. Slippery bastard. I don't see it. I don't know where it went. It was just here. Hold the door. Kerns.. Kerns, hold the door. Got it! I got it. Just hold the door, Kerns! I got the door! Be ready to fire. Maybe you don't trust us and we don't trust you, But what you know could get us out of here alive. So it's either talk or die. It has an unbelievably fast metabolism, like lightning speed. It's an amalgamation of 100 different organisms.. All predatory, all resilient. Human? Woodman used his own DNA. It's part of him. I think that's why the thing didn't eat him When it was in Woodman's lab. That's the only thing I could think of. What have I become? Custodian? Caretaker? Under the design of this higher intelligence, I embrace the role, Because I know in doing so, I am a breath beneath creation. June 6th, 1100 hours. The stems cells are grafting like a lock and key. The code is perfect. What is, in our minds, multiple lifeforms, in truth was meant to be one holistic organism. However its unrealized existence.. Its dormancy.. has allowed humanity to flourish. I know that now, like I know we will die shortly after its introduction into our ecosystem. Owing to these facts... I have finally chosen a name.. "Legion," for it is many and at the same time, one being. And for those who fall under it's voracious hunger, it will seem the dark spirit, the apocalyptic killer for which all monotheistic religions have warned. "Legion"? I never pegged Woodman as a romantic. You're listening to Woodman's reports? I don't.. I don't get it. You're outside the box. Nobody outside the box knows. You know. Anslow knew. Colonel Anslow. Surprised? I'm expendable. They made that real clear from the very beginning. Anslow said Woodman had lost it. Yeah, you could say Woodman's got a few attachment issues. I mean, if vanity and a huge ego Have anything to do with Psychosis, you could say he's grade a.. You let it out, didn't you? No, he did. You're the programmer. No, Woodman knew all the programs, he knew all the access codes. He did, he knew everything. It was his project! How do we know that? He's got a point. He opened up all the secured areas, he smashed the computers. I already told you guys all this. You guys are just gonna have to trust me. How? You told us nothing. You're here to kill me, right? I mean, isn't that what all your orders are, right? How am I supposed to trust that? Lieutenant Green, I assume you have breached the security barrier. The stone, your target, should be inside the control console to your right. We'll pick up Temple and Green on the way, then we'll go. Way too much ground to cover. Temple and Green are wide open down there. By the time we get there, they'll be shredded, Well, no. I mean, I can take care of that. They won't be. May I? Head's up. Talon thinks it's coming our way. What are we gonna do? Go behind the lab, find the door and get inside the cage. Hey, I don't know where it went. It was just here. I don't see it. Can't hear it. It's a predator. Thinks about one thing.. food. I guess we're no longer an easy food source. I don't believe this. She wants us to get in that? Huh-uh. Now wait a minute. This makes sense. If this thing can keep it in... I bet it can keep it out. We could be stuck in here a long time. He's taking them down to the base of the station. Know how long that's gonna take? They gotta go all the way down to the bottom. We have orders. I still don't like it. You ever put a piece of raw meat in a box then set it out in front of a hungry dog? No. They get awful agitated. Temple, Man, I don't want to get in here. What if they die? What made you change your mind? Still don't like it. Thank God I brought my fatboy. A shotgun?! She don't shoot BBs. Temple and Green are in the holding cages, but it's not down there either. Well, I'm sure it will be. You don't know. There's always a 4.5% margin of error, plus or minus. Are we going or not? I want insurance.. To see them for myself. Lead the way. Yeah. Take it easy. You're making me nervous. I hate waiting. Then just talk to me. About what? I don't know, anything. Like why you're here. In here?! Oh, you mean in this outfit. At least no one can say you're not a quick study. Sit down. Come on, sit down! All right, you wanna know? It's all in shooting for the top, Doing the best with what God gave you. Then there's the money. I mean, five years with this outfit, you retire with a pretty good pension. Oh yeah. I got an uncle back in Rockville, owns these speed traps.. gas stations, making a killing. I figure I go into business with him, then I'll start up a couple of my own. That ought to attract a pretty good woman, don't you think? Sounds like you got a plan. They make a lot of money. I'm sure. It's.. It's just that I never of heard a man trying to woo a woman with a gas station before. Gotta know where you're going if you want to get there. Pension, speed traps, woman. Kids. Yeah. Apple pie, Chevrolet, and a gas station. Green's American Dream. You.. you are a regular Casanova, Green. Shit. Where'd it go? I can't see it. Look out! Don't fire that thing! Why not?! 'Cause you're gonna blow a hole in the cage, that's why! Aah! Hey. Yeah. Something's wrong. The nodes are down. My cad's out. Nothing on the L.C.D. The Organism Room is on Sublevel 52. You will find the relic there. Only Talon is allowed classified access. How did you...? I didn't grow up on a peach farm. Damn it, I hate this place. Well, it's only up from here. At least as far as my clearance is concerned. There's nothing on my cad. We might be down too low. We've been having problems since we got to this place. Let's go. Move it. There wasn't anything in Woodman's Log about this thing breeding. Maybe you weren't listening. Maybe she just didn't understand or.. What?! It's a dead end. This way. All right, Charlie, get us inside. Wow. We're protected. What the hell is that? Asexual reproduction. A food source and they'll grow to be adults. Anslow screwed us. Bring in your best to draw out the enemy. Learn their strengths, learn their weaknesses. Meat. That's the order they whisper behind your back.. "Send in the meat." Not for this. How the hell could they create something like this? They didn't. They found this. Woodman. Well, yeah, he engineered it. It's his whole deal, But the recipe, the code... They found it. Where'd they find something like that? It's Southern Iraq, Tigris River. There was a sandstone chest sticking out of the riverbank.. An ark. Carbon Dating put it back 5,000 B.C. Woodman's Log.. That's what he was talking about. Inside the chest there was this stone. 40 billion symbols all over it. That's when they bring me in. Codebreaker. Turns out the whole thing is DNA. It's an artifact... That was put here by a superior race. I mean, at least that's my theory. Not Woodman's though, oh boy, you know? Divine intervention, some kind of apocalyptic ending to everything. I don't know. I don't buy into any of it. This.. That's an insurance policy. Anslow, he'd kill me for what I know. But this.. this whole place could disappear, and as long as you salvage this, you can do it all again. Then why didn't he just send us in to get it? What makes you think he didn't? What are you, Military Intelligence? Give me the stone. Where's Temple? He's gone. Drop him. Let's drop him now. He can't take us all. We can't. He's aiming at the glass. That's my objective. That doesn't mean we will give it to you. What you don't know is this complex was built with certain security measures. I walk out of here, I light this whole place up. He's got a failsafe. That's the tactical nuke I was telling you about. He won't do it. Yeah, he will. He's trained his entire life for this. Give me the stone. Give me the stone. Gimme the stone! That was frightening. But you can rest easy now that I have this. You can take him. He was bad. Did you see that? Did you hear that? You crazy son of a bitch. That... Was rude. Ohh! Ah! Ohhh. God, is that Green? Green got what he deserved. My God. Oh my.. ohh. Meyer, on my signal... Open fire. Charlie, run! It's closing in on us. Shoot it! Ah! Get it! I can't feel my legs! Get up, Meyer. Get up. Get up! Meyer, get up! We have to keep moving. I can't. Yes, you can. Get up now. I can't. Don't do this to me. Yes, you can. Yes, you can! Get up! I can't. Get up! Meyer... I'm not like you. I'm not like you. No, no. Do it! I don't want to feel anything. I'm sorry. They love you. They'll always love you. Nine months ago... We were ordered to hit a cartel. It was a standard operation. But Anslow wanted the spotlight. He wanted four stars on his shoulder. We had the location locked.. The hit locked. But Anslow held us until there were women and children. Over 50 died... And they praise him for it. It's why I told them I was out... That this was the last time. That's why I'm expendable. Meat. Your insurance. What's Woodman gonna do? It's not your problem. Let Anslow deal with Woodman. He's not gonna want to see his creation die. He'll let 'em out of the complex? I don't know. Eventually, yeah. There's always a 4.5% margin of error. Plus or minus. What do you think you're doing? After the last 13 hours, you have to ask? Oh, no, no, this is insane. I did not sign up for this. Coming with me? You do know what you're asking me to do, don't you? To go to hell. There's a blade wedged under the creature's arm. Woodman's scalpel. If it can be penetrated, it can die. Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's organic. I mean, it can die. It's like... Getting up underneath that soft palate and... Right up to the brain stem. That's suicide. Total suicide. I'll distract that thing. Just get the failsafe from Woodman. No, no, this is not a taking-candy-from-a-baby situation. Get it and sprint for the main doors. What about you? If you think you're gonna die, Just do it. Do us all. Now entering Sublevel 37. Straight ahead. You sure you'll be okay? I'll be fine. Charlie. I didn't expect you... To live so long. Give me the detonator. You want this? Take it. The experiment is over. Our work is done. There is no escape.. For any of us. If you try to leave, Charlie, You know you will die. So will you. Are you going to kill me, Charlie? You went too far this time, Woodman. Ah! Come and get me, you son of a bitch. You didn't think I'd leave you behind, did you? Anslow. Charlie, give me the stone. Trust me. What? I told you this was the last time. Don't even think about it! Don't do this, Talon. Goodbye, Anslow. Don't do this, Talon! Move! Take these. You always get exposure at this range. It's an iodine cocktail. It'll block the radiation. Don't worry, you're safe now. We're the good guys. It's me. No, Anslow's gone. He went cowboy on us. I never trusted him anyway. Yeah, I got her. I'm bringing her home.
