Ogundiji. A powerful warlord with physical strength and potent charms. A ruthless warrior and a hurricane of destruction. A ferocious weapon for any type of battle, Ogundiji is the deadliest tool for kings and mighty rulers of the world. Without Ogundiji, kings cannot win battles. Keep quiet! Keep your mouths shut! Are you all deaf? I said you all should keep quiet! Whoever makes a sound Will be silenced forever. This is war. Your Highness, King Kayeja. Where is the ancestral crown of this kingdom? But that is what makes me the king of Oniketo. Yes, I know. Where is it? It's with the ancestors. The ancestors? Who are the ancestors? Can you imagine! - My prince! - I am doomed - The prince! - No! - Enough! - I've been burnt by fire! - Enough! - There is war in the palace! We are doomed! The prince is gone. King Kayeja. Your first child is gone. Look up and look at your dead son! That's a taboo. Kayeja! Okay then, you, come here! Your highness! Come here! Help me! King! Help me! Where is the ancestral crown? - Your highness, please tell him. - The ancestral crown is in... It is in the secret room. Yes, it is in the secret room. Ilu... Ilusimi, stand up and take them there. You! Go with him. There it is. Fire has burnt me! My prince! Kayeja you have made me so angry. I will consume a tortoise with its hard shell. I will devour a porcupine with its quills. I will gobble up a snail in its shell. King Kayeja! Your time is up. Your life ends today. Great Baobab tree, What is it? Why do you a great mother, want to become a murderer? A baobab tree doesn't suddenly fall to block the path! Oh mighty Wind, why are you disturbing the peace of the forest? This looks suspicious. Now, rise up! Gbotija, the son of Lagbayi. The one who wakes and talks to the forest trees. Gbotija has the power to talk to forest trees. And now, he's headed to the School of Warriors to learn how to fight. All battles make you break a sweat. Every battle makes the hand weak. We fight to death in the warrior's house. Only the motherless can survive here for long. You see these ones, they have died untimely. Yes and they have become food to Ogundiji's crocodiles. I congratulate you, the survivors. Thank your creators. Welcome to the home of warriors. Hurry up. Make it quick. Clear them away. Bullet. Gun powder. Sponge. With royal beads. All these mean that your kingdom sent you here. Yes, my kingdom sent me here. I didn't come here on my own. Our enemies attack us everyday. That is why the entire kingdom sent me to learn how to fight in Ogundiji's school. A tiny glimpse of Ogundiji's men instills fear in the heart of other warriors. - I congratulate you. - Thank you. You can go in. Who is next? I am. What happened to your leg? I was hit by a bullet on our way in. - You were hit by a bullet? - Yes. Don't you have bulletproof charms? I don't. You don't? Are you are not fortified? What are you doing in the den of warriors? I have war in me, but I don't have charms. That's why I have come to the School of Warriors to learn how to fight, So I can fight with agility and become a formidable warrior. - That is why I came here. - Welcome. Warrior. Have you all dropped your luggage here? Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. Move faster. Be fast about it. Lift your hands up. Who sent you? You are doomed! Welcome to the School of Warriors. The house of charms. The house where peers rejoice at the sight of death. Ask before you enter. The house that doesn't allow for sloppiness. Shoot! Cock! Which one of you was scared? Who is the coward? What is wrong with you? Stand at alert! Act like a warrior! Get up! Rise up! The House of the brave. The house of death. The house of tribulations. Death is always lurking around the warrior's den. Only the brave and fortified plans for war. Whoever is captured becomes a slave to war. Not everyone that comes into the School of Warriors to learn how to fight becomes a warrior. A little laughter, and lots of wailing is the only way to live with anyone, without any problems. Welcome. Warriors! We fight with charms and our sweat. - Help! - Help us! You will all die today. Where are they? Wait, what else do you want me to do? You said I should leave the vicinity, and I did as instructed. To avoid problems here, I left the throne for you. And went into hiding, yet you sent some thugs to take what belongs to me. What exactly is the problem? It is called seniority. What senseless seniority? Look here, the grey hair signifies old age, and beards make you elderly. You see the patch? It is mere underestimation. A superior can relegate you to nothing. What a stupid thing to say. Alarinka don't trespass! - Yes! - And if I do? Baba that will lead to your death. Hold on baba, didn't you hijack your position as king? - Right? - Were you entitled to it? Aren't you a bastard? Your paternity is not from the royal family, I am confident to say, only your maternity is royal. You took the crown from him, - and he didn't fight you for it. - Right? You also want to take away his means of livelihood, you want to take it from him. Baba! You are too wicked! Let's go. - Look here... - What? It is said that if a man and a woman walk and urinate simultaneously, one of them will have more urine at the back of the leg. By the time I am done with you... Are you listening? - What will you do? - Our parents and families... - What about them? - ...they won't recognize you anymore. I like where this is going. From now on, watch your back! Because I've started a fire of war, And I've also put some water on the fire. If that water gets to its boiling point, you won't be able to eat Amala with it. I won't make Amala with it, I will peel your skin with it. - I will pour it on your body. - You? You will lose your life in this fight. Your life will end in my hands. Don't underestimate me. My friend, don't stress yourself, - I'll be back. - If he permits me, I will harm you. - You will suffer till you die! - I will show you! - The shoemaker's home? - Yes. Ogundiji, in fact, he has planted many crops over the entire land. Your brother is biting off more than he can chew then. He is looking for trouble. I am fire! When I am angry I get blinded by rage. That is good. I'll be right back. If you ask what we can do, we will show you what can be done. Who is the hand breaker where the head breaker exists? Who dares to tread in the path where I stride? Who dares me? I am terror. I scare a father and his child passes out. Look! Go and wage war against them at Ota Efon. They've bitten more than they can chew. Their time of death has come. Warriors! We fight with charms and our sweat! Open fire on them! The God of Thunder! The bringer of fire! With fire coming out of his eyes and mouth! Attack them! Hello there. How is it going? Have you heard from the battle field? But they just left. Even though the war against Modede village isn't a big war, they can't be back so quick. The warlord didn't even plan this right. Why is he sending high-ranking warriors like us to these small wars? The pawns he was supposed to have sent, are the ones we have pushed to the battlefield. As for us, all that is left for us to do is to be merry. You're right. Attack! Yesterday, some white men brought gifts of weapons. My Lord, did you sell anything to them? No, I didn't. They just recognize the great work we've been doing. I have kept three for you to take home with you Thank you my lord. That makes me so happy. But I will teach you how to use them, because they are different from our usual weapons. Maybe the warlord doesn't know he's bred venomous and dangerous offsprings. And that the stingers of his scorpions are potent In fact, he also birthed madness. Maybe he's forgotten that we are not novices when it comes to war. - Are we insignificant? - We are not insignificant. - Are we negligible? - We are not small. We are not small. We are not amateurs. Because during Alara's war, We fought with him In Ajero's war, we fought with him But Modede's war is not a serious war During Alara's war, we fought with him In Ajero's war, we fought with him But Modede's war is not a serious war Gbogunmi! I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Majala what has happened? Why are you running helter-skelter? News meets the wasp at home. Knowledge meets one at home! Show me! Abomination! The lizard can only try, it can never break a wall with its head. Before whom does their goat want to start barking like a dog? Agemo! Hasten up and rush to the war front. The one we run to is what we call a deity. The one that walks wide-eyed... One who walks gallantly into town is called a witch. The three of you, combine your spiritual forces together. Go and back up Agemo at the war front. Agemo! Agemo! When the finest students of the warlord fail in battle, when the war becomes unconquerable, Ogundiji calls on the Masked-Demon Assassin called Agemo. One more time! During Alara's war, we fought with him In Ajero's war, we fought with him But Modede's war is not a serious war Roast that yam faster. In Alara's war we fought with him In Ajero's war, we fought with him But Modede's war is not a serious war In Alara's war... How dare you?! I gave you a task, you delegated it. Don't you know that a delegated command becomes a suggestion? If there are two masters, one of them will live in agony. No problem. I will ridicule you in the presence of your juniors. You! You! And you! Take them to the dungeon and lock them up. Do not give them food and drinks, till I decide what to do with them. Warriors! We fight with charms and our sweat! Food is ready, come out everyone! Food is ready. Please, where is the rest of the food? Tonight, there is no room for gluttony. Yes, one wrap of corn meal and one bean bun will be shared amongst two people. That won't be possible. We were sent by our mistress, Kitan to give you these foods. And so? Go back and tell her. That I, Gbotija said one wrap of corn meal and one bean bun isn't enough to satisfy one person. Talk less of asking two people to share one corn meal and one bean bun into two. - It is not right. - Alright. No problem. We will deliver your message. I said it is not possible. Isn't that right? Okay. Which of you told the girls to return the food to me? Are you all deaf? They are not deaf. It is I. - You? - Yes. Even your colleagues in the other camp did not grumble, and you are here complaining. Is he back to his senses now? He is a bit stubborn-hearted. Maybe you should just kill me, because I won't keep quiet. I won't stop saying the truth. Fighting on empty stomach, and wielding swords in poor health, is not what Oduduwa wants. You still have the guts to talk? Your lips are still pushing words out? If you insist on being stubborn, I also won't take it easy with you. And if you now trigger my anger to the extreme, I will order your execution. If I die, I will go to my heaven. Well done. Our mistress said I should give these oranges to Gbotija. Sorry. Sit. I would rather stand. But I insist that you sit with me. Thank you. Wherever we see a rat, roaring in the gathering of tigers, we must praise it. It is me. You of all people, Aren't you scared at all? You addressed me without an iota of respect. What your superiors dare not try. You are a brave man. I... I am sorry. I didn't mean to disrespect you. Cheating is what I detest. For me, asides my creator I can stand up to anyone when I feel cheated. What is bad will always be considered bad. Come to think of it, It's not what you think the corn meal was undersupplied and I didn't want all of you to go to bed hungry, which was why I told them to serve what was available, with the thought that at daybreak, you all will be served double rations. I never knew that was the case. This is clearly a miscommunication. - Please don't be upset. - Please get up! Angry? I am not angry. In fact, now you have become more valuable to me. And to prove to you that I am not angry, would you like to be my friend? Friend? Isn't it obvious, with all these, who dare to says these aren't enough. If anyone says these aren't enough then they themselves can't be enough till eternity. - I am thinking this is small. - It isn't small. I hope you know that if a woman doesn't marry a man because of money... - Yes. - she will marry you because of food. When you regularly gift snacks to children, you become their good friend. What we've brought is nothing? - What is all these? - What we have here is plenty. Or should we go home and bring more? No, what we have here is enough. - It's enough? - Yes it is. Our mother-in-law is here. Welcome mother. -Welcome mother -My future in-law My in-law, get up don't rub your beauty in the mud. Thank you mother. - The great farmer. - Thank you mother. Thank you mother. For as long as the hoe and the soil are still in good accord, I'm certain that the great farmer will never lack. Mother I am overwhelmed with joy and my head swells. My eyes aren't just teary. You'd better not let your head swell too much because your friend over here might break it with a log. - Me? I can't do that. - You can't? For what you've just said I will give you a tuber of yam. -Wow! I thank you -You even thanked me? I will add another tuber. - I thank you again. - If you show more gratitude, I will reward you with more tubers of yam. - I will thank you for ever. - That's enough. You should also know when to stop. Thank you mother. How's your wife-to-be? Hope you met her at home? Mother, we've been here all morning, but no one has attended to us. We didn't see anyone. No one. That can't be true. How come? Where has she gone to? I will be right back Mother, by the way... all these are yours. These are all mine? Yes mother. - You mean I own all these? - Yes, they're all yours. And you said no one attended to you? - You shall be attended to immediately. - Thank you mother. I will be right back. My friend, my friend be thankful for me. - Congratulations! - My friend be thankful for me. -Congratulations -My friend please congratulate me. My friend please, please hail me. Hail me. - A farmer who never starves all year. - Yeah... With the biggest tuber harvests. - With a massive bunch of plantains. - Yeah... And the most hardworking farmer! My friend that's more than I expected. My friend enough of the eulogies, - so you don't shoot me away like a bullet. - I can't shoot you away. But, do a favour for me, call me 'the god of thunder'. - But, you're not Sango. - Please let me breathe fire. Don't breathe fire. Don't breathe fire. - Ah! - You can't... Hello, "Mr. Husband-to-be". With your over-sized lips. A senseless man looking around for what is not lost. - Such an aimless soul... - What? who wakes up every morning to do unprofitable businesses. - A worthless wanderer. - Jitoni? Mother, please stay out of this. - Why do you do this? - Please I beg you for god's sake. Let him listen to the same words that deafened the squirrel. Ajitoni, even if you don't respect my friend, you should accord me some respect. Can't you see me standing here? I can see you. If you were not an accomplice, you would not feel so insulted. Two senseless idiots moving around together. Two fools parading themselves around. You are both morons. Now your foolishness has reached the height, and I have no doubt it will land you both in the shore of disgrace. I can't take this anymore. Of course you can't endure this. Is this by force? I have said I don't want you as my husband. - Go to your houses. - Jitoni what is wrong with you? - My in-laws... - Mother... That was just a lover's tease. Come... Mayegun, be patient. Wait for me, let me go talk to her. Maybe you should hold me down too mother. -Don't let him go with the gifts -Please wait for me. Jitoni! The one person that can hurt us and also make us happy, and a skunk can kill a chicken just for sport, then God definitely understands everything. God understands what exactly? If you give a child an assignment, he dares not fail to carry it out. Who are they to disobey a direct order? Who do they think they are? I understand you my husband. We only scare children with the sacred cane, we don't actually hit them with it. Forgive them. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. May the gods not forget you too. Thank you. Don't thank me, you should thank Gbotija. He's the reason we have two paps each. If not, I wouldn't have been able to bring you all this food. Gbotija? Gbotija how? Is he in charge of food now? Yes. Kitan put him in charge of serving us food. Haven't you punished them enough? Forgive them. I have heard you. Thank you. Is there a problem? Enifunto, you may leave. What happened? What's wrong? Get out! Can you imagine? Just because we're not in the camp, things are out of hand? Look here, which one of the newbies is called Gbotija? Death! Put that food back in your mouth. I said put the food back in your mouth. Put it in your mouth! Good. Wehinwo, I locked them up and you had the guts to give them food? No problem at all. A fly always dies in the place of the palmwine. You three will be released. But you will kill him yourselves. Tie him up at the center of the training arena. Warriors! We fight with charms and our sweat! Please save me. - Please help me... - Shut your mouth. This boy does not know the gravity of his crime. Increase the fire. Please! Please save me, help me. Please have mercy on me. This pain is too much. Please. Please don't increase the fire. This pain is too much. Please. - What is the cause of his death? - Death Which dog dared enter into a tiger's den to kill its child? We're told he offended Ogundiji, and he scolded him. Ogundiji, the son of Ogunrogba, you are too wicked. A boy that the entire village sent to learn from you, you scolded him to death. - Is he dead? - He is dead. Who brought his corpse? Some of Ogundiji's soldiers. Why didn't you tie them up and beat them up? Can hair grow inside fire? Who dares confront them? - Is the king aware of this? - No. he doesn't know yet. But we need to inform him. Let's go. Isn't this person the reason Ajitoni rained insults on me? Yes, that's him. Ajitoni just got here. She's here. Who burnt my lover? Who removed the clothes on my back? Who stripped me naked? Who shaved the goat? Who dried up the river away from the fishes? Please don't let me run mad. Please wake me up. Wake me up! Wehinwo! Let me die with him. You can't go with him. Help me. - Let me die with him. - Toni, it's okay. Kings, I greet all you royalties. All you important icons across the lands. If we send a child on an errand, and the child delivers - we should appreciate such a child. - Yes. It is only right for us to take care of him. That is why I called this meeting that. Ogundiji, the son of Ogunrogba, wants to celebrate the festival of "ORI". -We all heard about it -You heard about it Ogundiji did a great favour for me and I will repay his good deeds. I will gift four strong horses to him. Yes, because if not for him I would have become a dead king. The masqurade would've died, and the crown owner would've come for it. Are you entitled to the crown you wear? Is that the route you want to follow? If that's the route you want to go, then it means we are all passengers of that same boat. None of you is entitled to the post you occupy. It was hijacked for you all. Ogundiji hijacked it for you all. It is true, he's right. But can a truthful person gather wealth? - Don't let us insult ourselves. - We were only reminding ourselves. Can you imagine? Please, we are done with our conversation and everything is settled. Don't let us just keep staring at this food, let's eat. - Is that so? - Let's eat. Your highness, is this an Antelope or Guinea fowl. This is an antelope. Well, it is Guinea fowl because I said so. I greet the owner of this house before I step in. Abuala the gatekeeper for Olodumare I greet you. Elegiri, I greet you. Wake up with your heads. Wake up with your senses. When a mother calls, the child answers. When the gods beckon, the priest answers. If the priest invokes the spirit, the spirit will come out. Today I've sacrificed a goat, let it be accepted. I've sacrificed a lamb, everything I say must come to pass. Elegiri! That's good. Thanks, I'm grateful. Now, tell them everything you want with your mouth. Start telling them. Start! Please, Elegiri, come and help me. Come and fight for me. Ogundiji took something precious from me. He has cheated the small house of Elegbede. He saw Alaje village as a small village and took advantage of us. Elegiri please, help me and fight for me. Hasten up, go to Ogundiji's house and kill his wife. Because he killed my lover, and if his wife dies too, there's no crime in it. Everything she said, must come to pass. Now, go. I said go! Are you that scared? After all, you are a handsome young man. And my father will not make me his wife, neither will I remain single forever. Look, Iroyinogunkitan, I'm not worried for myself. I'm worried for you. Because, I don't want you and your father to fight. That's why I've said we need to take this slow. Yes, but my father is not at home right now. And when you've seen that he isn't at home, you should have come to play with me for some time. We need to be patient with everything... Hello mother! Welcome mother. I hope I'm not in trouble. Mother... What's the problem? Are you seriously asking me? What is that young man doing over here? Young man? - Do you mean Gbotija? - No. I'm referring to 'Gbotogun', because I don't understand what he's doing here. I hope you know your father must not see him here? I've heard you. You had better listen. Because a respected visitor knows to stay in his lane. - I hope there was no problem? - No, let's go. A taboo! The vulture's child does not die in its presence. I am the elder's cat and I'm not food for a child. He who beats up a mermaid's child will not go back whole. Where are you sham demons from? You are sickness and I'm death. Sickness and death are not mates. When death talks, Sickness stays quiet. Look around you, you will die today. Impossible! A bat eats and defecates through it's mouth. -This is a great battle -Let the bullets cease. The gunpowder should stop working. Death becomes powerless when you know its identity. Bats don't lay eggs. Great Teak Tree, you own their guns, and you must not betray me. Remember with a machete I swore an oath with you. Great Teak Tree, now transform their guns for me. To the pillars of my house, I am going to war! God of thunder, it's time for war! It's time for war. Here he is, please come to my rescue. Ashabi? What is this? Who are you waging war against? Which village are you waging war against? Elesun has called for war! They must see war. My brother, a witch must not eat money while Esu mustn't eat coconut oil. You know that's your mother-in-law's village. Please help ask him. Please ask him, because I don't know who gave him this sensless assignment. I don't know who gave him this insensitive task, help me. Help me tell him that if we throw stones into the market it will definitely land on friends and family members in there. Should I still be suffering when I have a man like you? If my father hears of this, what do you think he will say? Morunmubo why did you do this? When you know that since my mother died, there's nothing I can't do for Ashabi. Will someone like me accept to fight in a war then back out? I, Gbogunmi! I, Gbogunmi! Gbogunmi! Son of war! I am the son of war and charms! I, son of Ogun Lagbede, the iron bender. The one that stabs unapologetically. The one who fights like the storm. The one who piles up war like tubers of yam. Is this madness or insanity? Master! We are not mates! We are not on the same level! We've never been in the same calibre. A dog can only wag its tail to its friend. When did you become this? How dare you? I am singing a warrior's song, and you are backing it up like a coward. I gave you a task and you failed to carry it out. You embarrassed me in the presence of the people that love me. You turned yourself to a friend and a foe. One leg in, and one leg out. Listen, I thought you were someone I could boast of. I am ashamed of you. - Baba, my lord, please there's... - Keep quiet! I am talking and you have the guts to interrupt. Explain to me! What makes you think you can dare me? Gbogunmi! You disobeyed my command. You will regret this. Have mercy my Lord. My husband, you have to make a choice. What God has blessed us with is more than enough. Let us leave Ogundiji. - So it is you? - Hello sir Me? I heard you are the one who fought the enemies that came into the warlord's house. Sir... I was only following your footsteps. My husband, are you done with Gbotija already? Yes, I'm done with him. I assumed you will give him a small gift. Because to be honest, that young man really did great. Should I cut my head for him? Please don't get angry. You honored me and I am happy with you. Look at me. I will give you charms. Someone who lived in Saki for 20 years doesn't mean he has charms. That he stays in Ijebu for 30 months doesn't mean he cannot curse people. If you aren't determined to get charms, you will never know power. I came to the warrior's den and, I learnt about war and charms. I have... Look, I have lots of charms! Dangerous charms are in my possession. In this warrior's den, after our great warlord, Ogundiji, and Agemo, the Masked Assasin, there has never been any other warrior like me, Gbogunmi in this land. I, Gbogunmi the child of war, the son of Ogunlagbede, the iron bender... The one who piles up war like tubers of yam. We need to properly meet each other. - Okay. - Yes. How about Gbogunmi's case? He's been waiting outside all morning - Please forgive him. - Forgive who? Who does he think he is? I'm yet to decide on what to do with Gbogunmi. Alright then. What about your food? We are done cooking. I want to eat nine snails this afternoon. Nine snails, despite all the stress we went through preparing this food? - What did you just say? - I didn't say anything. Where is Master, is he done? He left for his room as soon as he was done talking to me. He who lives with one and doesn't know his character is one's enemy. You can go but make sure you see me sometime soon. Okay sir, thank you. My destiny is that of an important person. This is coconut water. Coconut water does not leak. This is Adun. May your life be sweeter than Adun. This goat will send away your death and sicknesses. I embrace wealth and reject wretchedness. Eat this. He doesn't know it is the head. Gbotija! Whatever has a beginning has an end. What looked difficult is now a thing of the past But to be sincere my love, today, - you were larger than life. - Really? Do you know that no one has ever done what you did today? - Is that true? - I felt so proud of you! Only my father holds that record. How did you do it? I'm a warrior, and I need to act like one. You must tame the Iroko tree before it grows tall too. What has he even done? Just because he saved your wife, his peers are treating him like a king. Ogundiji! See, children of nowadays are like snakes, they can't be trusted. Do something about it. Don't treat it with levity Are you from a warrior's lineage? No, we are not warriors in my clan. Lagbayi is my father's name. Help! Help! Great Ackee tree, hide my son. Great Gahmar tree.. The death of my father affected so many things in my life. Home grown chickens and bush birds were not birthed in the condition. That is why, I made up my mind that I must learn how to fight. And when I become a warrior, I will ask the enemy about the death that killed Lagbayi. I will avenge the death of the people of Iwon. The one who dances at the mention of war, who rejoices at the sound of war like a sparrow. How did you get yourself out of the tree that day? Every Lagbayi lineage, knows trees by their names. Wood carvers and trees are friends bound by oath. This boy has won my heart. Look at me! I will make you a warrior. I, Gbogunmi, no one dares try me. I, Gbogunmi the son of Ogun Lagbede. The iron bender. The one who strikes unapologetically, whose bravery knows no bound. The one who piles up war like tubers of yam. Is this madness or insanity? Look at me, you can't leave right now. I will give you a powerful charm. - It is called "when the battle is tough". - Sir I am very grateful. I would be happy. Gbotija! I hear you can brave the harshest weather. They said you're supposed to have been promoted to the next rank. But no one can pass without a test. Yes, because only the strong and brave can be called a warrior. Thank you wise one. The test is in three stages. Congratulate yourself if you succeed in all three. For your first test, you and Gbogunmi will fight to the death here on my training ground. Warrior! We fight with charms and our sweat! Ogundiji! A farmer who takes food into the wild, does it, not for the journey ahead, but for the journey back home. My son - Wise one. - Your character singled you out. Look, the king only sends his favorite slave on errands. The slave who runs the King's errands successfully will get good rewards. This test before you... is a test that brings about promotion. If you succeed, you will be promoted. But wise one, why am I the one asked to fight Gbogunmi? My son, Ogundiji does whatever pleases him like a god. And he's full of wonders like a chameleon. As for Gbogunmi, he is death. He is death that kills with vengeance. A demonic human that fights like a spell. Wise one! This means my death is near. My son, death isn't here yet... and that was not to scare you. I just said it as it is. But, the chick that will crow as a cock will never fall prey to a hawk. Goodnight. Is Ogundiji really this wicked? There's no other name for a wicked man, he is simply wicked Ogundiji just loves satisfying his ego. He uses people but protects his own. Ogundiji doesn't make suggestions. He only gives orders. We know you did something he doesn't like, but what exactly is Gbotija's crime? Gbotija did not do anything, Ogundiji is just not happy that Gbotija is celebrated by everyone. Ogundiji loves to be the center of attention. Ogundiji just wants to send the boy to an early grave. Why pay good deeds with evil? Despite all you said the boy has done for him... - He still instructed you to kill him. - Yes And I must obey his command... because the battles not assigned to me I fought in them, without mentioning of the one meant solely for me. I shouldn't disobey his command a second time. I'm not happy that I will use my hands to kill the boy who calls me 'father'. War is pain. Disappear! Great Omo tree, I see you, I know your lineage. You told them not to carve wood from you but they carved you for weapons. You asked them not to carve drums out of you but they did and the drums tore. Oh Omo! It has conquered death. Inside him must you... Gbogunmi! Gbogunmi! Gbogunmi! - Gbogunmi! - My father. Gbogunmi, my father. My father! Gbogunmi! Come here. You are my son... and henceforth, I've made you my friend by oath. See me as your father. I will be there for you like a father. You're now my blood brother and I will never let anything bad happen to you, no matter how little, because you are now my blood. My father! Gbogunmi! Gbogunmi! Gbogunmi the great warrior! Gbogunmi the strong man! Can you believe, that what Ogundiji expected was not what ended up happening. I'm very happy with the way it turned out - Really? - Yes I am happy. Don't you know that Gbogunmi is a terrible human? I gave him a task and he refused, He dared to defy Ogundiji on the same task. Yes. Is he not being put to shame now? He has been put to shame. Even if he's crawling, he would be in heaven by now. Please your highness where's your daughter, Morounmubo? She's in her room crying rigorously. Has she moved back home? Yes she's back home, there's no point for her come back here since her husband is dead. I gave the order. I ordered her to come back to my palace. If she remains there they might try to marry her to another man and I don't want such nonsense. In that case, we must be careful with our words. In my palace? No one can change my order. So Gbogunmi has no charms. See how he was killed so easily by Gbotija. A boy he's old enough to have as a son. What has he been collecting money for? Claiming that he fought in wars. - Collecting money for nothing. - Yeah, for doing absolutely nothing. So you are all part of the wicked people of this world. So you are the evil ones behind the mask. Even if everyone is making mockery of his death, it shouldn't have been you at all. So pitiful. My father, despite all he's done for you. - Your son-in-law for that matter. - Who is his father-in-law? Did I give him my daughter? Didn't I warn you not to marry him? I warned you, Now you've married him and he's dead. You brought this upon yourself. - You said I shouldn't marry him? - Yes. Was that why you killed him? Am I Ogundiji? Or am I Gbotija? Am I a hired assassin? I don't kill people, I am a king. Now, get out of this place! - Regent Oyenike. - Your Highness. Tell Ogundiji to give us another powerful warrior, that will do as we say. Not like Gbogunmi. He must be someone we can control. - Let's emphasize the control part. - Forget him The second test! You will sleep in a coffin for seven days without food or water! What is it? Why are they trying to place me in the position of the dead? And for seven days? In a coffin? When I'm not dead? That's enough my love. A timid fighter cannot become a warrior. A warrior that shows fear, is called a coward. A lazy farmer will not finish planting before the end of the rainy season. And the one who doesn't have plants to harvest, will not have money through the year. Don't be timid and don't be a lazy coward. Just set your eyes on the goal. Death today, wealth tomorrow... If we die today, how do we enjoy the wealth coming tomorrow? Look, I don't think I want to do this anymore. Maybe they should call on the masked assasin, Agemo, to kill me. No, no. No! By the power of the gods you shall never encounter the Agemo. Don't you love me anymore? Why utter such words when you know I do? What's so certain to you is that you are all I have left in this world I love you more than you could imagine, Kitan. If that's the case... So, do you think Ogundiji will give his only daughter in marriage to a coward like you? Alright then. I've heard you. If that's how you want it... I am ready to do all that you want. I am ready to do whatever pleases you. Just in case I don't survive... please take care of yourself. There are two outcomes to a somersault. You either succeed and stand... Or you fail and fall. If I fall, remember my love for you Kitan. By the power of the gods, you shall not fall. The child who is my spitting image. The child that works with one in a war. The one who fights without looking back. The one that goes along to the king's river. My daughter is everything alright? Mother... he's been locked in that coffin for three days without food or water. Mother, does he really need to be in there for seven full days? -Iroyinogunkitan -My mother I hope you are not in love? Mother, stop answering my questions with questions, I said does he need to be in there for seven days? Yes, it is compulsory. Yes... because he wants promotion and he must pay the price. Yes, I'll see you later. This is not fair, at least he should be allowed to drink water even if they won't give him any food. My love. Atanda from Iwon Town The son of the one who carves the iroko tree. Son of the watch guard. The child of the tree doesn't suffer headaches. My liver must not hurt... Gbotija Gbotija! Gbotija!! Gbotija!!! I'm answering you in seven, I'm answering you in eight and sixteen folds. I, Gbotija the son of Lagbayi the wood carver. I am hale and hearty. He is hale and hearty? His voice still sounds strong like a bell's. Someone I kept inside a coffin without food and water? No problem. Every trader wants to make money off the farmer, it is left to the farmer to resist them. There's more to be done. Where is water coming from? Gargle water and spit it out. Great Iroko tree! spit it out. Strong tree of the forest! The great Iroko tree that daily accepts sacrifice. Oluwere! Remember I swore an oath with you, don't desert me. Great Iroko tree! Great Iroko! Now shatter! What? What is happening? I know all trees. I know all your names. Do not turn your back on me now, I've sworn an oath with you. I have eaten with you. Eyo! Don't mock me, don't let me grovel too much before you respond to me. A bat eats and defecates through its mouth. Water does not stay long on egg shells. Now, let me out. How is this still happening? Oh, great Omo tree, it is you? Oh strong tree, Great Omo, remember I swore an oath with you. Omo, don't betray me. Don't let me die in here. You can't live in a heated house and be comfortable. Let the ancestors accept anything I have said today. Now, accept everything I've said to the gods above. I command this coffin to shatter! Gbotija! Gbotija! Gbotija! For, your third test, I want you to wage war against Alaje people, where they sent spirits to attack my wife in my home. I want you to completely annihilate them. And only three young warriors will go with you. Warriors! We fight with charms and our sweat! Iroyinogunkitan. Is this not the festival of wealth going on in Aje kingdom? Yet Ogundiji has asked us to wage war against them, and turn their happiness to sorrow. Why?! Who does that? God of wealth! The source of wealth. The lover of shades. You beat up a mother and child. You beat the elderly where it really hurts. - God of wealth, please don't punish us. - So shall it be. - We have sacrificed to have more of you. - So shall it be. Aje do not punish our king out of his throne. - We have sacrificed to have more of you. - So shall it be. - Aje do not punish us out of wealth. - So shall it be. - We have sacrificed to have more of you. - So shall it be. - May we have never lack money. - So shall it be. - May we live in abundance. - So shall it be. Aje does not fight. Aje rests on its way to a fight. Aje comes in quietly and peacefully. May we all enjoy the peace and calm of the god of wealth. So shall it be. - Wealth will be easy for us. - So shall it be. We have paid homage, may we have wealth So shall it be. Help! Help us!! Ogundiji! What is this again? I did all you asked, why is Agemo here? Agemo, please what have I done wrong? What have I done wrong? I've only done as commanded. Please I beg you. Great forest trees, come to my aid now! Iroyinogunkitan, you are the Agemo. I have shot myself in the foot. Forest giant! Listen to me, a rat always throws a walnut away because it can't crack it. I have bargained with all trees three times. I have made covenants with all trees seven times. I swore oaths with you all, and I never betrayed you. It is my turn, do not betray me. Ants are conditioned to follow the trail of the palmoil. Now, tree of the Forest, take it back! Iroyinogunkitan I will not let you die. Iroyinogunkitan, you won't die. You will escape this death. - Gbotija. - Yes? My love. My time has come, and nothing can reverse it. Why? Why would Ogundiji turn his only child to a monster, using you for evil tasks? Ogundiji is not my biological father. Adigun Kukoyi is my real father. Sorry. Ogundiji, attacked us suddenly in Oniyo village. Mother, please wake up. - He killed both the young and the old. - Mother, please wake up. He burned wives with fire, and buried their husbands in the ashes. I was the only one he kept alive. Please. There's a mark on this child. I have use for her. Keep quiet! Take her home. I would have preferred he killed me that day rather than let him use me as tool for evil. My time with Ogundiji opened my eyes to the harsh reality, that people exploit innocence children who aren't theirs for their evil schemes. Ogundiji turned me into a messenger of death. Turned me into a fearful being in every land. He turned me into Agemo, the masked-demon assassin. Ogundiji and those he works for turned me into a whip for the innocent. Since you know all these, why did you stay? I wanted to leave... but... - my love... - I'm with you. I couldn't leave. I am nothing but his puppet. He controls my spirit. He has powers to control me, and whenever he summons my spirit, I am unable to refuse. And when I had his own child, he hid him with the regent, Oyenike. Oyenike? He keeps using me for evil tasks all over the land. - I am in pain. - You will survive this. You will survive this. -My love -I'm right here with you. I'm with you. I'm with you. I'm with you. Kitan. Kitan! Iroyinogunkitan! Kitan! Impossible! A new born is fed by multiple hands. A corpse does not move with his own legs. And a fly will perch on friends and strangers alike. Now, avert Agemo's death! Avert it! Avert... Ogundiji the son of Ogunrogba! Ogundiji the son of Ogunrogba! Ogundiji the son of Ogunrogba! It is time for war. Kitan. Kitan! Kitan! How did this happen? What happened? Who killed Iroyinogunkitan? Your husband did this. Your husband sent her on a journey of no return! - My husband? - Yes What do you mean? Don't you dare lie to me. A dog won't fight it's child. A parent will never kill a precious offspring. What parent? A deadbeat parent? Is that a good parent? Or a very bad one? Is that a man or a wicked being? Why?! He gathered us all here, and turned us into slaves. He manipulates young people, and uses them as he wishes. If any of us dares to be wise, you find a way to turn us against one another. What was his gain when he killed Gbogunmi? What was his gain? And all for what? We pay attention to the beginning of events, but it's harder to see where it will all end. Listen to me everyone. We all came here to learn how to fight so that we can defend our villages. But, after we were done learning we started fighting each other. Isn't that so? Let me ask you... What did Alaje kingdom do to us to deserve such massacre? What did Wehinwo do, to deserve such death? Youths wake up! Kids, wake from your slumbers. Don't let them keep using us as tools for the rich. And these bastards? They are like dogs who protect their puppies but devour the offsprings of grasscutters. Ask them all, where are your children? Where did you hide your children, while you turn us against ourselves? Now let me ask you, Where is Ogundiji's only biological child? My husband? A child somewhere? My husband doesn't have any child anywhere. A deceitful person is not stupid, but the person who falls for their deceit is unwise. Whose child is Ogunlaje who lives with regent Oyenike? -It shall be well with you -So shall it be. -You shall succeed -So shall it be. - The gods will be with you. - So shall it be. - You will become successful. - So shall it be. You will be excellent. Here is it. Thank you. -I greet you regent Oyenike -It shall be well with you. - So shall it be. - Well done. Well done. Thank you for taking good care of him. You're welcome. Well done. How dare you? Ogundiji, tell me he's lying. And so what? If it's true, what can you all do to me? I have been betrayed. I have been too trusting. Even when we both agreed to use my womb to source for power? Despite our agreement for me to stay barren so you can be the warlord you are today! What can you do? So what? I have been betrayed. Keep quiet! I said shut up! What will you do? Look, let me deal with him first, then I'll come back to you. Gbotija! You are small. You are too little, Gbotija. You've passed your boundary, your strength is small. I fought at Kere, I fought in Alara's war. I battled with Ajero, and I also destroyed all the wood carvers of Iwon. - Gbotija! - The massacre in Iwon? -Yes -It was you who invaded our village? Is that your ancestor's Land? Warriors, attack him! It's only the bastards amongst you that won't follow me. Hold it! A pestle angrily pounds the mortar. Move out of my way. Fly away like a leaf. Stay down. A legume will not crawl beyond its boundary. I cannot be carried! The forest is the home of giant trees. The forest is the room of massive roots. All the trees in the forest wave up to gods above. I know all your names, now come to my aid. Stop right there! For Lagbayi, my father. For Gbogunmi, my warrior father! For my love, Iroyinogunkitan! Wise one, What has happened? The finest calabash in the house has broken. The great warrior is dead. The head is gone. There's no one to watch over the animals. Ogundiji! Ogundiji! Subtitle translation by: Hellen Wanjiku
