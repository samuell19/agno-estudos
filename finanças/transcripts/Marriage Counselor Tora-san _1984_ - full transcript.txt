A Shochiku Production He came home. After years of wandering, He returned to where he was born. He expected a heartwarming welcome from his family. But they had died. Being deprived of their livelihood by wicked men. They killed themselves. He swore to avenge them. Will you keep this for me? I wish I could close this shop, Gen. If the boss hears this, he'll kill you. Bravo, Mary! I'm tired. Give me some water. She's a good singer. Why not do a TV show? Shut up. Beat it! Water please. Tora, forgive me. I have a family to support. Give me a drink. You're alive? Weren't you killed in Los Angeles? The hit man you sent was no good. Strange! Fool! You failed! I'm sure I hit a square-faced guy. Shut up! Stop it! Get him! Watch out! Mary... Will you forgive me? I'm glad. Mary. Come to think of it, I feel sorry for you. What's left after achieving revenge? Emptiness. What does revenge mean to him? Sadness enveloped his heart like a dense fog. The fire's no good. It's smoky. Smoke meat, not people. It gagged me.

Sakura Thank you for your gift money to Mitsuo. Does he go to school everyday? Yes, but he never studies. He joined the school band. Children grow so fast. Indeed. Excuse me. That reminds me of one who never grows up. You either. Think about yourself. Hello. Mitsuo's here. Whose flute? I bought it. I didn't say you could. It's secondhand. Matsu's brother was using it. It's good. How much? Only 10,000 yen. It's a bargain. In installments, too. Mom, I'll pay for it myself, okay? Is it all right, Matsu? Let's go. Bye, now Leaving? Thank you for the snack. Come again. Only 10,000 yet? Does he know his father's salary? He's smart enough to know a bargain. Children have money nowadays. Don't do it here. You're here, Sakura? It's over? What happened? Akemi got engaged. Really? He came to tell you. We exchanged betrothal gifts. Congratulations! How did Akemi look, happy? She made me nervous. Come and thank them. Thanks for everything. Never mind. Congratulations! Now, you feel relieved. Hardly. Today, as I greeted him, She laughed. You looked funny. Why? He stuttered. Looking like a boiled lobster. You made me stutter. You are so uncouth. What's "uncouth"? He was being modest. Meaning what? Enough! Go home! What did that mean? She's finally getting married? I'm amazed she got a man. I don't know why he picked her. What a father! Most of the single ones around here are married now. What's wrong? We still have Tora. You're right! I forgot him. From Tora! Look. A package from Tora. You startled us. Rare. Open it. Scissors. Speak of the devil and... What is it? Look, it's for Mitsuo. Tora remembered he started junior high. He's an uncle after all. It's a globe! It's like a toy. Probably he's saying for Mitsuo... To be a man with worldly vision. Worldly? I see. Morioka, Iwate Prefecture. He is in Morioka. Where's Morioka? This globe is too small to show it. You dropped the world. I'm desperate like.... Over-ripe eggplants. Hard to bite them. Today's a festival. I don't care about profit. 1,000 yen will do. Thank you. Which one? Don't drop it. Hi, pop. Which one? No, thanks. Come again, then. You want a bigger one for your daughter? Noboru! If it isn't Noboru! Buddy! That reminds me. You live near here? I missed you. Still in this racket? Obviously. Your daughter? You got a decent job? You've got to come to my place. Okay. Wait there. Come on, pop. Buy one for your son. Come on. It's a bargain. That's where I live. It's only a lousy dump, but please come in. Come in. Mama. I told you about Tora. This is him. You his wife? Say hello to him. I hear you were his boss. Hardly. Sorry to drop in on you. He twisted my arm. Come in. Please. Buy some sake. Food, too. Have the restaurant deliver something delicious. Here's some money. You needn't buy sake for me. What are you saying? We'll drink to our fill. We'll close. Don't bother. I'm not here to drink. Buddy, don't talk like that. Come, Noboru. What? You and I aren't buddies anymore. You run a decent shop now, and I'm still just a peddler. Even if I come to see you, you should send me away. Saying, "I live a decent life now." If you said that, I'd have to leave right away. On the contrary, You even want to drink with me. That's hardly the thing to do. Look, a customer. See to her. I'll leave. Wait! You left this. Sorry I didn't tell you. It's a gift for you. Keep it. Thank you. Please take care of Noboru. Take care on the way, boss. Boss? I don't rate that title. Excuse me. Tora? Where are you? Hachinohe? When will you get back? You'll go to Hokkaido now? Tough work, huh? Nothing new. The President's daughter Akemi got engaged. That's about all. We're fine. We're waiting for your return. Goodbye. He talked so fast. Is he well? He's off to Hokkaido. What's he doing? Hokkaido? I envy Tora. Your daughter's marrying. Look cheerful. Cheerful? The weeding costs a fortune. I wish I could hang myself. Kushiro, Hokkaido Welcome! Are you the owner? That's right. I have a license. Will you hire me? Where did you work before? In Nakashibetsu. I didn't like the terms. We've got to hire through the union. I know, but I couldn't get in touch with them. I might hire you, but... You need a reference at least. Indeed. So, no job? Go somewhere else. I will. Thanks a lot. Some kid! Do girls like that come often? Once in a while. They usually have a problem. She looked cute. She attracts young customers. She might cause trouble with customers. That happens. Is that how it is? And my old lady'd get jealous. Even at her age, she gets jealous. What are you looking at? The sky. I see. Nice day. Business is slow everywhere. Sure is. Born in Hokkaido? Yes Your name? Fuko. They call me "Drifter Fuko." Really? They call me "Drifter Tora" They do? Gee! What's your line? Me? Nothing significant. Shall I guess what you do? Show me your hand. A barber. I'm right, huh? What's so funny? You were in that shop. You knew? They say I'm too familiar with customers or something. They tend to bully newcomers. I can't stand it. I fight with them. That's why I never last. I bet you're to blame, too. Why? Because you're pretty. They're envious. Talking with you, I'd get conceited. Is that so? The steak was good. I ate it all. Feel better? That's good. Well... Let me... Never mind. I invited you. The check. You mustn't do this. A woman paying embarrasses a man. Thank you. Not at all. How much? 4,200 yen. How much? 4,200 yen. I tipped that barber too much. Is there a bank around here? What bank? Do you know the Shibamata Bank? You don't? Actually, when you ordered steak, I wasn't sure I could afford it. You said the most expensive one. The most expensive food I know is fried shrimp. You saved me from sleeping on a station bench. Thank you very much. I'll pay you back soon. Don't worry about it. Thanks. Are you going to Nemuro tomorrow? Yeah. Maybe I should go with you. To find a job? Yes. I have an aunt there. I haven't seen her lately. I'll go get a timetable. Wait here a sec. You okay? Careful. Excuse me. Will you share the room with someone? Share? We're full this evening. I wish you'd stay with that girl. I can't. She's a stranger. I'll cut the price in half. What sort of person is he? A quiet type. Really? Come in. He agreed. I'll bring your supper. Hello. Excuse me. Hello? Give me 0298-23-9644. My name is Eisaku Fukuda. Why look so glum? Have some. Thanks. You drink? You a white collar worker on a business trip? Hardly that. What, then? I'm going to see my wife in Kiritappu. Is that so? She's home for a delivery? Going to see your baby? Is that all you can imagine? Want to hear about me? If it's interesting. It's a common story. I bought a house in Ushikunuma near Tokyo. You work in Tokyo? Yes. The land was small but very expensive. My pay isn't enough for the loan. I called my mother to take care of our daughter. My wife went to work. Only three weeks later... She eloped with a guy. I couldn't tell my daughter or my fellow workers. I lied that she was a her home. A year passed. I now know where she is. I'm trying to get her back. So I came all the way here. A lot happened, huh? Dammit! I wish you hadn't told me. Hello? Momoe? It's Papa. Are you being a good girl? Is that so? Who's he? My roommate. Roommate? Have you eaten? Croquettes? That's good. Let's go out and drink. I don't think so. If left alone, he might kill himself. I'm not weeping. No choice. Go downstairs and get more sake. Want a talking bear? Fine. Will you bring more sake to the Lilac Room? Listen, Tora. What? Do you think there's any point in Seeing my wife after she eloped? We've discussed it many times. Maybe it's pointless, but... Chances are she's unhappy and waiting for you. Think so? Or forget here. It's up to you. Hurry, or we'll miss the train. Leave that gloomy guy. Just the two of us will go. Okay. Good luck. Goodbye. I'll go, too. She lives here? She likes lively places better. If she loves him, this is paradise. It's true. Where to? I'll leave. Hey! Can't you see I was joking? 15 minutes by taxi. A lone house. Its roof reads "Yanmar." Take us there! Yanmar? There's a bridge on the way to Kiritappu. There. Look at the roof. Does she really live there? The stationmaster said... A married couple live behind the factory. And the wife's from Tokyo. There's no mistake. Maybe she's having a rough time. She may be waiting for me. Go to her. Help me, if I get into a fight with her man. Leave it to me. What if she's happy with him? Give up. That's what a man should do. I'll do so. Too late. She's got a kid. That does it. Kayoko. I'll go to town later. Buy some beef there. I'll cook sukiyaki. Don't blame her. I know. Don't lose hope! I know. Thank you! He'll get home alive. We wasted our time. What? Didn't I say there's no use taking him there? "Will you run away with me?" "Sure, the two of us together." When's the next train for Nemuro? In an hour. Will you make some tea for us? We're bushed. Nemuro What kept you? We got your space. What a farce! What happened? I tried to help a guy... All right? What did you do? I went there. Who with? By myself. No! That's a lie. It's true. Aunty! Been well? Why, Fuko! Surprised? I'm looking for work here. I got a phone call from Sumiyo. She said she didn't even know where you were. I was terribly worried. Sorry. You could at least write to me. You're like your late mom in that respect. You've got only her shortcomings. Nemuro Spring Festival Come on, buy my crabs. Tora! Selling these things? Did you get a job? Almost. My aunt found me one. The shop is near here. Good. Relatives often help. Last night she kept scolding me. I've had it. It's nice someone worries about you. Come and take a look. In Tokyo these things sell at department stores. Ask any vendor how much one costs. They'll say 2,000 yen. But you can buy for 1,300 yen A mere 1,300 yen! Very well, I'm nearly desperate. How about 1,000 yen? I'll take one. It's wise of you to buy now. A birthday gift for your man? Only 1,000 yen! Thank you very much. 1,000 yen The absolute minimum. Want to see my show? Come Come and watch our show! Come on, miss! The world's greatest motor show! The most thrilling, breathtaking show on the earth! It's starting now. Come, everyone. Hurry! Kitami Inn Tora! No work today? The saying goes, "Rain is a peddler's worst enemy." You look nice. I brought you food. Eat it with them. Thanks. Why not join us? I can't right now. May I come this evening? Of course. You gave me that music box. It was on my birthday. Is that so? I'm glad. See you later. Sorry, Tora. That's okay. The maids go home at night. They're part-timers. What are you looking at? Hear the foghorn. I hate it. It makes me feel sad. Reminds me of a noodle vendor's horn when I was a child. They blew horns. I know. After Mom left me, I always slept alone. When I woke up at night, I heard the horn. It made me feel so lonely I started to weep. Is that so? As for me, it only reminds me of hunger. I'd rush out and buy noodles. Come here. Have some sake. What will you do when the festival ends? Let's see. I'm at the east end of the country. I'll go back to Kushiro, Sapporo, Hakodate, then Tokyo. Can I come with you? What? With me? Why? Something wrong with your job? No. Is it your aunt? That's not it. I want to be with you. I want to travel with you. I have money. When it's gone I'll work. Even as a bar hostess. I don't mind. What do you say? Bring some sake! The maids are gone. You get it. Hey, there are people in the next room. I have a sister 7 or 8 years younger than me. Name's Sakura. She used to tell me off years ago. She'd say, "Living like that, you'll end up regretting it." But when I was young, I thought regular jobs were stupid. "Mind your own business. I'll live my way." I didn't listen to her. But the men I drifted with then have all settled down. They're married and live decently. Only jerks still peddle at my age. But I'm young. I want to experience many things. What's the sense of experiencing misery? It's not for girls. Right? I'm warning you, Fuko. Work hard here. Marry an honest man. You may find it dull at first. But in 5 or 10 years, You'll realize I'm right. I know it. You're actually a coldhearted man. Tora, join us for a drink? You too, miss. I'm leaving. You are? It's late. Shall I walk you home? No thanks. I'm not a child. Aren't you mistaken about me? I'm going now. Endure hardship and work hard, okay? And you may think that.... Even a bum like me might be of help. Then, phone Toraya in Shibamata, that I told you about. I call them sometimes. So you're going? That's right. Thanks for everything. I wish you luck. Goodbye. Tora... Yes? If you were a little younger.... I'd marry you. Don't teast the old man. Welcome. Give me a shave. High Priest. I appreciate your help. Hello, Sakura. The President's daughter is marrying already. Time flies. What time is it? About 12:30. I must get ready. Are you also going? No. I must tend the shop. Wedding ceremonies are nice. I wish I could go. I prefer weddings to funerals. Excuse me. It's time you married, too. Is Akemi ready? She's getting dressed. They asked me to attend. We must hurry. Thank you. You look so pretty. Really nice. If only you don't speak, you'll be perfect. My teeth look yellow. Keep your mouth shut. They look like corn. The way you talk! I'm sorry about this. My place is so small I must use your room for preparations. That's all right. We don't mind. By the way, you look funny. Did you have a tailcoat? Is that a tailcoat? I thought I'd wear a kimono, but Akemi said... I'd look like a comedian. So I rented this. I look funny? You look like a magician. Yeah, I need a pigeon. Ready, Akemi? Have some tea. Thanks A bride's father... It's time to go. She's ready. I wonder what your dad will say. Do you know what to say to him? Say what? When marrying, a daughter should thank her father. Nothing to thank him for. Watch your mouth! He spent money for you. Thank him for that Must I? It's awful. President, she's ready. How beautiful! Take a good look. No thanks. Go closer and take a good look. Thanks, everybody. Fine feathers make fine birds. Now, Akemi. What's up? Dad, thank you. I'm sorry to make you spend money when business is slow. I'll find happiness. All I want is for you to be happy. I don't mind the money. I'm glad you thanked him so well. Don't cry, Akemi. Akemi, you're lovely. It's a joke. I'll remember this! Lower your eyes. Thank you very much. Dad. What? I want to pee. Stupid! Hold it unitl you change. Don't shout! Hello, High Priest! Congratulations! Thank you very much. Welcome. Please sit down. Excuse me. Toraya here. Thanks for your patronage. Sweets? They come in 500, 800, and 1,000 yen boxes. Fifteen 800 yen boxes? Sorry. Fifteen you said? Tora! Hey, the gloomy guy from Hokkaido! Nice to meet you again. You're alive? I guess I am. And trying. I was afraid I'd miss you. Thank you very much Welcome home. I met him in Hokkaido. How do you do? Your husband was kind to me. She's my sister. Your sister? Where's your wife? I have no wife. Sakura server him some sweets. Sit down. I was worried about you. Thank you. This is a gift for all of you. Actually, Tora, I saw Fuko the other day. Fuko? Where? She phoned me. We met at a coffee shop. Is she in Tokyo? Evidently. She lost some weight. She asked me to lend her money. I was embarrassed. What did you do? I don't mind lending, but I thought... I should avoid any trouble. So, I asked for a guarantor. Then she left. For all of you. Thank you. Darn you! Don't do that! Keep out of this! She came all the way to Tokyo and was out of money. Why didn't you lend her some? You should've offered all the money you had.... And said, "Take all this for now." No wonder your wife left you! You stingy idiot! Don't shout. Get lost! I wanted to lend her money. But I only had 300 yen. Why mention my wife who walked out on me? Take it to him. I'm sorry for this. Watch out, idiot! Who's he? I'm talking about the woman. The good-looking man... The young man who came. Is he Tora's rival in love? I told you to keep out of this. The issue is about Fuko. She's in Tokyo for some reason. Who is? Tora wants to find her somehow. But all he knows is her name, Fuko. Then it's hopeless. I'll get it. Her name alone isn't enough. The phone's ringing. It could be Fuko Toraya here. Oh, Bingoya? Hang up. Cut it short, Fuko might call. Hiroshi, I've got an idea. What about an ad? This one says, "Come home. Father." How about, "Fuko, I'm waiting. Phone me"? I wonder if she'd read it. This is too small. A full-page ad is better. "Fuko, I'm waiting. Come see me." It'll work. What's funny? How much do you think it'd cost? A full page ad! Cost? Don't you care what happens to her? I've never even seen her. Why must you meet her first? What a theory! You've come home after a long trip. Let's have some tea. I don't want tea. Tora, welcome back! I wish you could've been at Akemi's wedding. Everyone, thanks for everything. They'll honeymoon in Hawaii. You spent a fortune. I don't mind. It's for her sake. Tora's turn is next. Haven't you found a bridge yet? Gave up? He's so morose. Why not congratulate him? Akemi's wedding. Brother! Congratulations! A girl goes to Hawaii, spending money squeezed from workers. On the other hand, there's a girl, homelss, weeping alone. The world's unfair. What are you trying to say? I'm sorry. Anxiety is killing him. He's jittery. I don't squeeze money from my employees. Don't mind him. I do mind. President... What? I apologize. Let's have a drink. When I was so happy... We already apologized. He shouldn't pan my daughter's wedding... Just because he can't marry. Wait a minute! That's no way to talk! Stop! The thing is, we must find Fuko soon. But how? He went out in this rain? Some brother! We're goofing off at home. A rainy Sunday. What a pity! Goodbye. He is looking for Fuko today, too. Just walking around won't help. Look at this. The agony columns. "Fuko, come back. I'm so worried I can hardly sleep. Tora." Sorry Hi! Is there a shop named Toraya near here? Go straight. You'll see it on the left. It's a dump. Any tobacco shop around here? Brother, what do you feel like eating for lunch? I'm not hungry. What a man! Shall we order noodles? Welcome. Is there a man named Tora here? Yes, there is. I met him in Nemuro. I'm his sister. Can I help you? A girl named Fuko wants to see him. Fuko? Your brother knows her. She's at my inn. She's been sick a while. She asked me to bring Tora. That's why I came. He's here, right? Yes. I'll go get him. May I have your name? Tony. Tony, from the motorcycle show. Please sit down. Excuse me. Thank you. The only brand available. Keep the change. This too. Tony? He looks like a punk. Know him? Fuko's with him? He said that? Why the heck is she with him? I don't know, either. Anyway, she's sick and misses you. What'll you do? Will you lend me some money? Whatever you do, no violence! We'll cut formalities. Let's talk on the way. Gen, go back to the temple and work! Don't take tips from strangers! I'll tell on you! Put on slippers. I brought you Tora. Stay and talk with her. I'm sorry. I missed you a lot. Say no more. You were lonely? Can you walk to the door? Stay put and wait. Hello? Sakura? It's me. Will you get Hiroshi and... Ask him to drive the factory's car to Shinagawa? Tell him to bring some blankets. You come, too. Don't ask why for now. I'll be waiting. She was sound asleep. I didn't wake her. Good. The doctor said she needs sleep. What a day we've had! It's our first time at this. She and that show guy were like that! Like what? Keep studying! What's going on between Tora and her? I guess she was close to Brother first. Then that show guy took her. He took her? Why? What does she see in him? He's a show-off. Don't blame me. It's a matter of passion. Whatever life she may had led, She felt so forlorn she asked Tora's help. What about Tora himself? Poor man! It must have hit him hard. That's why he went out to drink? Fuko! Well enough to walk? Yes, thank you. You look better. It's from Aunty. Thank you. The flutist on the left is Mitsuo. Why, really! What will you do from now on? No point in going home. I'll work in Tokyo. Why not stay at our place? Uncle brought good news. A barber near the statiion needs help. He's our frined. The shop is nearby. It's very convenient. You'll have to settle down somewhere. Why not stay until then? What's the matter? In Hokkaido, Tora often told me to lead a steady life. Seeing you and your family made me understand what he meant. I wonder what he told you. Actually I'm an awful woman. I wish I'd met you people sooner. It's not too late yet. Mom! Don't stare at us. Go away! Serves you right. Sorry to make you come. That's all right. It's hot. What happened? I fell during the show day before yesterday. Risky work. I'm full of cuts and bruises. A short-term job. So's mine. You know why I came? Sure. Let's be frank: Leave Fuko. Don't interfere with my woman. We're both itinerants. You know how I feel. She grew up in hardship. She may seem like a tomboy or a delinquent. But she isn't. She's decent. She can marry, make a happy family. Don't you think so? I'm not too young to understand that. But get this: She wants to come with me. That's why I'm asking you. Please leave her. Buddy. Yes? You're a lot nicer than you look. Excuse me. Let's call it a day. Workers, line up for your pay. Are there so many of us? Line up. Shimamoto. Matsuda. Here. A million thanks. Don't be sarcastic. Hiroshi. Here. Thank you very much. Thunder? Coming this way... It may rain this evening. Indeed. Brother shoud hurry home. Fuko, the laundry is dry. Are you going out? I have something to do today. What? I'll tell you, but only you. I'll see Tony. That man? I don't want to leave him cold. We must talk. It's the 15th. He'll hit the road tomorrow, so I must see him today. Can you settle it by yourself? Do so, then. Think I should tell Tora first? You can explain when you get back. How about tofu? I bought some. Welcome home. Where's Fuko? Upstairs. She got better. She took a walk earlier. Yeah? She took a walk? Good! Sakura bought beef to celebrate her recovery. So we'll have sukiyaki? Uncle, what about Fuko's job at the barbershop? Luckily they needed help badly. So I settled it. Good. That place is good. We know them all. It's nice to have a trade. Sure thing. Is that a hint for me? Everyone's so talented here. Welcome back. Been with Fuko? My pay. Thanks. A husband hands his pay to his wife. How nice! I wish Fuko's life could be like that. I know! How about a barber for her husband? A sweet guy won't do. He got to be an honest man. They must understand one another. They'd work hard to save money... And have their own shop. I see. A small but cozy shop. A nice European picture hanging on the wall... Tropical fish in a tank by the window... The scent of good perfume... Soft background music... I can feature it. When I got home, I'd go straight to the shop. "Welcome!" says her husband, his hair neatly trimmed. "Fuko, Tora is here!" Fuko then appears, wearing a white smock. "Welcome back, Tora. It's been a long time." While lathering my face, she gripes about him: "He's a bore. He doesn't appreciate jokes." So I'd set her straight, Men don't have to appreciate jokes. Take Hiroshi, Sakura's man. He's a bore. He's a jerk. But they get along well. Some nerve! Tora's right. Welcome back. Going somewhere? She said she has something to do today. But, we're going to eat dinner now. Where to? To see a friend of mine. What friend? Stop asking and let me go. You can't tell me? Fuko, you aren't doing anything wrong, so tell him. Look, she's going to have a talk with Tony. At this hour? She must see him before he leaves. I'm going. Wait. There's no need to go. Why not? I settled it. You weren't rough on him? Of course not. What did you tell him? I asked him to forget Fuko. He understood. There's no need to see him. Join us for dinner. I'll go change. Tora! Why did you do that? Shouldn't I have? It's a matter between Tony and me, not your business. Not my business? Try to understand. Keep out of this. Tora was very worried about you. Sure. You must realize it. What's wrong with me seeing Tony? Why shouldn't we talk about us? No point in talking to a loafer like him. Loafer? What are you? What? You're both just drifters! Stop being cheeky! He knows Tony's type well. Don't get mad. I know what Tony's like. He's spoiled and desperate. I know that. But if I were with him, he'd change someday. I know he would. If you miss him so much? Go to him. Don't talk like that. I thought you'd understand. That's why I asked for your help. Do as you pleased! That's not the proper way to talk to her. Wait a minute! Goodbye. Thanks for everything. Fuko! Did I talk too much? We should've kept quiet. Well? She's gone. Where's Tora? I never expected such a tragic ending. Was I too harsh? Don't worry. She knew how you felt. She said to tell you she's sorry. She did? That girl? Love brings happiness. Love also brings grief. She knew hers would bring grief, but couldn't help herself. Don't worry. She'll pull through. Mail, Mrs. Suwa. Thanks. Hot, isn't it? Sweltering. From Fuko Kogure "Dear Sakura: I'm sorry." "I knew you were worried about me." "But I was so ashamed." "I cound't write to you sooner. Forgive me." "I went home to Hokkaido." "I stayed with my aunt for a while." "I kept remembering..." "Tora, Sakura and all everyday." "I wanted you to know your memories consoled me." "When summer finally came to Hokkaido," "I happened to meet a former colleague." "My aunt liked him very much." "It turns out I'm going to marry him." This is big news! What is? Fuko is marrying in Hokkaido. Really? It's great! I wsih Brother knew about it. I'll tell Hiroshi. "His only merit is, he's decent. "But I believe Tora would like him." As a matter of fact, I was afraid she might've killed herself by now. So was I. I'm glad. What'll I do? What? She wants us to attend her wedding. In Hokkaido? I want to go. Why not? She has only one relative. A chance for Mitsuo to see Hokkaido. I'll help you out with lunch money. What'll we do? Date: August 23. Place: Yoroushi Spa, Nakashibetsu "A little far, but a very nice place." Kenebetsu Mr. and Mrs. Suwa? You're Mr. and Mrs. Suwa? Get in, please. I thought a bus would be better. Lead car, forward! Sure you have everything? Get in. Start! Don't forget me! Shortly before you arrived... A Tarajiro Kuruma phoned us. My brother? Yes. He said he's coming right away. But he's across the mountains. Buses go the long way, so it takes 4 hours. Crossing over the mountains is faster, but bears are around. Are there bears here? The bears this year are fierce. They ate 4 of my cows. Its' a great loss! Isn't it? Beware of Bears Wedding for Kogure and Iwata Here they are. Mr. and Mrs. Suwa, we appreciate your attendance. Whos' the boy? We forgot their son. I'm sorry we left you. Sakura! Fuko, congratulations! Did you hear? Tora's coming. Good! When will he arrive? I don't know yet. Today, if a bear doesn't get him. Say hello to them. He's my man. How do you do. Congratulations! Come in, please. Take a bath and rest. Your brother will come soon. Please come in. Hello, it's been a long time. This is an emergency. A bear! A bear is near the spa! Hunters, assemble! A bear! I repeat: A bear is near the spa. Hunters, take your guns and assemble behind the inn. Children and peersons picking wild plants, Return to the spa. The police! A bear! A bear! A bear! Where is it? There! Uncle! This is bad! A bear's after Uncle! Uncle? Tora Brother? Hiroshi! Be careful! Who's Tora? Where? Don't shoot! We might hit him! Hey, play dead! Brother, play dead! Hit the dirt! Die! Play dead! Dead! Don't shoot! Tora! Fuko! Tora! You're safe! It's me, Fuko! Fuko? I'm glad. You're marrying a decent man. Thank you. You crossed the mountains? Yeah, and I ran into a bear. Are you hurt? Not really, madam. Something black suddenly came and.... Hey, you're Sakura! Yes. We're here, too. You all right? Is my foot still there? The bear bit it. You still have it. It's bleeding a little. Uncle's sandal. Look! Brother, hold on! Hey, is he alive? The End
