His birthday's not 'til next week! What's goin' on down there? Is his mom losin' her marbles? Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move. l'm not worried. You shouldn't be worried. Of course Woody ain't worried. He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten. Hey, hey. Come on, Potato Head. If Woody says it's all right, then, well, darn it, it's good enough for me. Woody has never steered us wrong before. Come on, guys. Every Christmas and birthday we go through this. But what ifAndy gets another dinosaur, a mean one? I just don't think I could take that kind of rejection! Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced. This is Andy we're talking about. lt doesn't matter how much we're played with.

Uh, nothin'. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all. Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose. It's just a mistake! Well, that mistake is sitting in your spot, Woody. (CHUCKLES) -(GASPS) Have you been replaced? -What did I tell you earlier? No one is getting replaced. Now, let's all be polite and give whatever it is up there a nice, big Andy's-room welcome. (GULPS) (HEAVY BREATHING) -(BUZZES) -Buzz Lightyear to Star Command. Come in, Star Command. -(BUZZES) -Star Command, come in. Do you read me? Why don't they answer? (GASPS) My ship! Blast! This'll take weeks to repair. Buzz Lightyear mission log, stardate 4-0-7-2. My ship has run off course en route to sector 1 2. I've crash-landed on a strange planet. The impact must've awoken me from hypersleep. Terrain seems a bit unstable. No readout yet if the air is breathable. And there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere. -Hello! -(KARATE YELL) (SCREAMS) Whoa! H-Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! -Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to. -(BUZZlNG) -Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody. -(BUZZlNG CONTlNUES) And this is Andy's room. That's all I wanted to say. And also, there has been a bit of a mix-up. This is my spot, see, the bed here. Local law enforcement. It's about time you got here. I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit. My ship has crash-landed here by mistake. Yes, it is a mistake because, you see, the bed here is my spot. I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuel, or have you discovered crystallic fusion? -Well, let's see. We got double-A's. -(GASPS) Watch yourself! Halt! Who goes there? Don't shoot! It's okay. Friends. -Do you know these life-forms? -Yes! They're Andy's toys. All right, everyone, you're clear to come up. I am Buzz Lightyear. I come in peace. Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur! Wh-why, thank you! Now, thank you all for your kind welcome! -Say, what's that button do? -I'll show you. VOlCE BOX: Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! TOYS: Oh! Hey, Woody's got something like that. His is a pull string. -Only it's... -Only it sounds like a car ran over it. HAMM: Oh, yeah, but not like this. This is a quality sound system. Probably all copper wiring, huh? So, uh, where you from? Singapore? Hong Kong? Well, no. Actually, I-I'm stationed up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four. As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps, I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance. Oh, really? I'm from Playskool. And I'm from Mattel. Well, I'm not really from Mattel. I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buyout. You'd think they'd never seen a new toy before. Well, sure. Look at him. He's got more gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife. -(BUZZlNG) -Ah, ah, ah, ah! Please be careful. You don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off. Hey, a laser! How come you don't have a laser, Woody? It's not a laser! It's a... It's a little light bulb that blinks. -What's with him? -Laser envy. All right, that's enough! Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy. -Toy? -T-O-Y. Toy! Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is "Space Ranger." The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's preschool toys present. Gettin' kinda tense, aren't ya? Uh, Mr. Lightyear, uh, now, I'm curious. What does a Space Ranger actually do? He's not a Space Ranger! He doesn't fight evil or, or shoot lasers or fly! Excuse me. -TOYS: Ooh! -Oh, impressive wingspan! Very good! Oh, what? What? These are plastic. He can't fly! They are a terillium-carbonic alloy, and I can fly. -No, you can't. -(SIGHS) Yes, I can. -You can't. -Can. Can't. Can't. Can't! I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed! -Okay, then, Mr. Light Beer, prove it. -All right, then, I will. Stand back, everyone! (ELECTRONIC HUM) To infinity and beyond! (AIRPLANE WHIRRING) -Can! -REX: Whoa! -Oh, wow, you flew magnificently! -(WHISTLING) I found my movin' buddy. Thank you. Th-Thank you all. Thank you. That wasn't flying! That was... falling with style. Man, the dolls must really go for you. Can you teach me that? -(LAUGHING) Golly bob howdy! -Oh, shut up!

It looks as though I've been accepted into your culture. Your chief, Andy, inscribed his name on me. TOGETHER: Wow! With permanent ink too! Well, I must get back to repairing my ship. Don't let it get to you, Woody. Uh... let what? I don't, uh... What do you mean? Who? I know Andy's excited about Buzz. But you know he'll always have a special place for you. -Yeah, like the attic. (CHUCKLING) -All right, that's it! -(TONAL HUMMlNG SOUND) -Hmm. Unidirectional bonding strip. Mr. Lightyear wants more tape. (HUMMING) Hmm? Listen, Light Snack, you stay away from Andy. He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me. What are you talking about? -Where's that bonding strip? -(BEEPlNG SOUND) And another thing, stop with this spaceman thing! It's getting on my nerves! Are you saying you wanna lodge a complaint with Star Command? Oh-ho, okay! Ooh, well, so you wanna do it the hard way, huh? -Don't even think about it, cowboy. -Oh, yeah, tough guy? -(MECHANICAL WHOOSH) -(GASPS) (CHOKING) (CHOKING CONTINUES) (PANTING, SNIFFING) The air isn't... toxic.

I can't tell. -Hey, where's Lenny? -Right here, Woody. Oh, no, I can't bear to watch one of these again. WOODY: Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl. What's going on? Nothing that concerns you spacemen, just us toys. I'd better take a look anyway. (SID SHOUTING) BUZZ: Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device? That's why, Sid. -(BARKING) -Hmm, sure is a hairy fellow. No, no, that's Scud, you idiot. -That is Sid. -(SINISTER LAUGHTER) -You mean that happy child? -That ain't no happy child. He tortures toys, just for fun! -(BARKING) -(GRUNTING) Well, then we've got to do something. What are you doing? Get down from there! -I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson. -Yeah, sure. You go ahead. -Melt him with your scary laser. -(BUZZlNG) Be careful with that! It's extremely dangerous. He's lighting it! He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!

Whoa, whoa! Oh! -(SCREAMS) -TOGETHER: Buzz! -Buzz! -(TOYS CHATTERING) SLINKY: I don't see him in the driveway. -I think he bounced into Sid's yard! -Oh! Buzz! (HORN HONKING) Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to say something. What is it, boy? -He's saying that this was no accident. -What do you mean? -I mean Humpty-Dumpty was pushed... -No! ...by Woody! -ALL: What? -Wait a minute. You don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you? Potato Head? That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbing murderer! -(GASPS) -Now, it was an accident, guys. Come on. Now, you, you gotta believe me. We believe ya, Woody. Right, Rex? Well, ye... N... I don't like confrontations! Where is your honor, dirt bag? You are an absolute disgrace! You don't deserve to... Hey! You couldn't handle Buzz cutting in on your playtime, could you, Woody? Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favorite toy. So you got rid of him. Well, what ifAndy starts playing with me more, Woody, huh? You gonna knock me outta the window too? I don't think we should give him the chance. SERGEANT: There he is, men. Frag him! Let's string him up by his pull string! HAMM: I got dibs on his hat! BO: Would you boys stop it! Tackle him! No, no, no! Wait! I can explain everything! ANDY: Okay, Mom, be right down.

Andy'll find you here, he'll take us back to the room and then you can tell everyone that this was all just a big mistake. Huh? Right? (PANTING) Buddy?

If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place... Oh, yeah? Well, if you hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me... Don't talk to me about importance! Because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy! What? What are you talkin' about? Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet! I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness. And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendezvous with Star Command! You... are... a... toy! You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear! You're a... You're an action figure! You are a child's plaything! You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity. Farewell. Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, ya loony! -"Rendezvous with Star Command." -(CAR APPROACHING) DRIVER: Hey, gas dude! ATTENDANT: You talkin' to me? -Yeah, man. Can you help me? -Pizza Planet? Andy!

I... -(ENGINE REVVING) -I found a spaceship! It's a spaceship, Buzz! Come on, man, hurry up! Um, like, the pizzas are getting cold here! -ATTENDANT: Cutting Boulevard, huh? -Yeah, yeah. Which way? Now, you're sure this space freighter will return to its port of origin -once it jettisons its food supply? -Uh-huh. And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you home. -Well, then, let's climb aboard. -No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz! Let's get in the back. No one will see us there. Negative. There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area. -We'll be much safer in the cockpit. -Yeah, bu... Buzz! Buzz! DRIVER: That's two lefts and a right, huh? -Thanks for the directions, okay? -Yeah.
