[ominous music] [bird squawking] [footsteps tapping] [bird squawking] - And you may ask yourself, why can't I see the Lord? [door slams] Why doesn't he give me an answer to all my questions? But you see, the Lord will answer you, and when he does you must taste the blood of His son and the Holy Spirit. You must feel that your spiritual body is clean from sin and never let the Antichrist walk by your side. Let your brother lead your way through life and together you will see him rising out of a white light, a light so bright you can not see it with your eyes. So do not let sin break the mighty bridge to holiness. [ominous music] Do not because it will cost you and one of you know it quite well. Don't ya? Yes. I can see your yellow eyes spark from shame. And that, my evil brother, is because you have committed the most unbearable crime of all. He murdered a defenseless old man. And you wanna know the worst part? He felt good when he did it. Yes, didn't you, you creep? Let me tell you one thing, brother. If he starts to haunt you I won't fell sorry for your soul. You deserve to be punished. - No! No! No! [parishioners chattering] - [Man] Sir, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm all right. [dramatic music] [evil laugh reverberating] No! No! [screaming] - Jesus Christ. [ominous synthesizer music] [dog barking] [keys clattering] [Eric breathing heavily] - [Eric] Dearest Steve, I know we haven't been in contact since you left Sweden with your parents 20 years ago, but I'm sure you remember me. I was your best friend when we were kids, and if you don't have any strong memories of me, I'm sure you remember the teacher we had in school, [door creaking] Mr. Andersson. Mr. George Andersson. I don't think anyone can forget about him. [ominous music] [hand smacks] [boy cries out] [cigarette sizzling] - Ow! Ow! - [Eric] He sure made life hell for us every time he got a chance. [door slams] I'm also very sure you remember what happened that late night in October when we decided to play a trick on him. [dramatic music] [ominous music] [lighter clicking] [firecracker thuds] [lighter clicking] [firecracker thuds] [firecracker popping] [dramatic music] [Mr. Andersson crying out] [fire crackling] Maybe we were lucky then that nobody discovered you and I were responsible for that awful fire. Do you remember how we used to go off together and say to each other that even if it was terrible we were glad he was gone forever? Well, Steve, we're not that lucky anymore. Mr. Andersson is back. I'm not crazy, Steve, and I'm telling you the truth. You'd better come home immediately before it's too late. You've gotta believe me when I write this. It's my only hope. Eric. [upbeat synthesizer music] - We can not have you running around here. We've listened to everything you have to play and it's no good. Get out. - [Man] I think he'll be havin' lunch at Ruth's. You'd better talk to Morgan if you need that tape. - [Woman] Uh-huh? - Any calls for me? - You need to call Rick before one o'clock, okay? - [Man] [mumbles] Crazy Night's cover was okay. Couldn't you talk to Grace about it? - [Man] Come on, come on, one more. [Steve knocking] - [Man] So you're afraid of the dark? - Mornin', Steve. - Hi Harry. - [Man] Once and gagged on its bitter aftertaste. - Just wanted to see if there's anything important for me to know before I leave. - [Harry] Leave? - Yeah, you haven't forgotten have you? Vacation, tomorrow. - Oh, Bermuda wasn't it? - It was, but I think I'll go home to Sweden instead. [water sloshing] - [Harry] What's your wife say about it? - [Announcer] Anheuser-Busch, St. Louis, Missouri. - I haven't told Linda yet. - You haven't? Well, good luck, buddy. - Sure. - Oh Steve, Mike Tylers from The Bone Breakers called and he's really pissed at you. I don't know what he was pissed about because I couldn't' understand him. You know how he talks that jive when he gets angry. - What kind of bullshit is this? - Sorry, what do you mean? - Well, if you think real hard now, sucker, you just might remember that I was told I could re-record my Fender for the new record because the equipment in your so-called studio made it sound like shit! [phone ringing] ♪ You I said ♪ [mumbles] from me [phone clattering] - [Operator] Operator. - 842, yeah? That's the number in Sweden. Can you connect me, please? - [Operator] Okay. - Thanks. [man cackling] - Why do you have to go to Sweden now? I don't understand it. - I just have to go. He's my friend and he needs my help. - You haven't seen him since you left Sweden. You still call him a friend? Steve, you could at least tell me why these change of plans are so important to you. - I wish I could. I really wish I could. All I can say is he's not okay. - You mean he's critically ill? - I guess so. [siren blaring] When will you leave? - Well, he wants me to come right now and since there's a plane leaving tomorrow I figured... - I wanna come with you. - With me? - At least we'll go away together. And after all, Steve, it's a good time for me to see your home country. - But why do you wanna go to that small town? There's nothing for you to do there. Besides, this time of year it's always raining. - I don't care about the weather. - You know, I remember Eric as kind of a strange guy and maybe he'd be a bit embarrassed to meet you. - Why don't you tell it like it is? You don't want me to come. - Linda. - And you don't see that all I want is to be with you sometime when you're not working day and night, taking those pills to keep you awake. But I always come in second, don't I? - Please! - Well, you could always bring a picture of me, show it to him. Or would he be embarrassed to find out that you're married? [ominous music] [ominous music] - [Pilot] [mumbles] just now to Buffalo on across Lake Erie, just to the south of London, Ontario. That's on our descent at about [mumbles] into the Detroit Metropolitan Airport. In Detroit-- - Eric isn't really sick you know. - [Pilot] Clear skies, 60 degrees [mumbles]. We'll update that weather for ya prior to landing. - In fact in the letter he says he's being pestered by ghosts. - [Pilot] In the meantime, folks, we hope you'll sit back and relax. - What kind of ghosts? - Come on, Linda. He must have gone crazy some way now. You understand? That's why I didn't want you to come with me. - Well he's not gonna kill me, is he? Besides, I think ghosts are fascinating. - Maybe in the books you read. - Relax, Steve. You know I read in a novel somewhere that if a ghost haunts someone it's only because it wants to take revenge of some kind. He's probably just having some kind of drinking problem. - I hope so. [bell dings] [speaking in foreign language] [change rattling] - [Eric] Hello. - Eric? - [Eric] Who is this? - Is that you, Eric? It's me, Steve. I hardly recognize your voice. [Eric whimpering] [ominous music] - [Eric] Go away! Go away! - [Linda] Is something wrong? - [Eric] Go away! Go away! - I think I have to go to him, immediately. - Now? - We'll catch a cab and before I go out there I'll let you off at the hotel, okay? - Steve? Steve. [ominous music] - [Steve] Hi. Are you free for a ride? - Yes, sir. Are you sure that's the address, sir? - Yeah, but can you stop at the Center Hotel first to let my wife off? - No, just drive straight to the house. - Oh Linda, I told you I'm going out. - You're not going out there by yourself. I wanna know what the hell is going on. [ominous music] [dog barking] [ominous music] [dog barking] [Steve knocking] [Linda sighs] - [Linda] Maybe he's not home right now. We should've let the cab wait for us. - Well he answered the phone, didn't he? [Steve banging] Eric? - Are you sure this is the right place? The driver said something-- - Of course it is. [dog barking] [suspenseful music] [floor creaks] - Jesus. Looks like he's been huntin' in here. - Maybe you were right when you said he could have a drinking problem. [dramatic music] [Eric shouting] [Eric grumbling] [glass breaking] [Eric groans] - Is that him? - Is that really you, Eric? Why did you attack me? Don't you recognize me? - I do now. - Sorry if we scared you. This is my wife, Linda. We've been married five years and she kind of thought it would be nice to meet an old friend of mine. Maybe... I think she'd like a bath. Yeah, wouldn't you, darling? You know we traveled 24 hours. Is that okay? [ominous music] - Why don't you take her up? You remember the place, don't you? - Yeah, I know my way around. - [Eric] Fool. - I'll be right back. Sure is nice to see you again, Eric. Can we turn the lights on out here? - If you wish. - You don't see much in the dark, you know. - I know. That's why the lights are out. [ominous music] - Well? - I still wonder if this is the right address. - I told you, Linda, what I thought it would be like. Please don't argue with me. - Well, are you gonna talk to him? - You got any better ideas? - Well, why don't you go down and talk some old memories with him? Just tell me when we're leaving. I won't disturb you. [door slams] - Okay, I'll see if I can calm him down. [ominous music] - Take a bath. [rifle snapping] - Hi. [glass slams] It's been a long time, Eric. - Why did you bring her with you? - Look, we haven't met in 20 years and you haven't said hello yet. - I asked you a question. - All right then, I'll tell you. We were on our way to Bermuda when I got this letter of yours. The least I could do was to bring her along. - If you think I invited you on a vacation, you might as well go back to Dallas or Bermuda right this minute and find you two some time. [ominous music] [water running] [Linda sniffs] - You know what? You disgust me. You really are out of your mind. - You think so, Steve? You really think so? Well look at me, goddamn it. Do I look like I'm crazy? - I didn't say that. - If anybody is crazy, it's you. He's back. When we did that thing you were so scared you could shit your pants, but now, just because it's been such a long time ago you seem to think of it like it was no more than a gag. I bet you told your wife all about it. - Well of course I haven't told her. I wouldn't tell anyone. But when I got this letter I was afraid you might begin to talk. [water running] [dramatic music] [Linda screaming] What the hell are trying to prove? [fist banging] Linda! [metal clattering] [water gurgling] If you're trying to scare me, you better stop it right now because we ain't stayin' here one more-- [Linda whimpering] [Linda screaming] Linda? - I think this is... [suspenseful music] [wood creaking] - Don't you touch her. Oh. What happened, Linda? My God. Will you go down and call for an ambulance? - I don't think that will be necessary. - I don't want anymore of this, Eric. Just get down and do what I tell you. Now. [ominous music] Please, darling. I beg you. Wake up? Please, darling? [suspenseful music] [Linda vomits] [ghost grumbling] [ghost cackling] [ominous music] [gun fires] - Look, she's okay. [wood creaking] [rain pattering] - Since I understood he was back, I haven't dared show myself outside this house. I'm sure you can see why. It can make you see things, real bad things. I remember the first illusion he gave me. It was in church and I-- - I don't wanna hear about it. I don't want to. [suspenseful music] - It's just like being real drunk. Or high on drugs. You see these horrible things so clear and you have to concentrate so hard to get the visions away from you. I think he wants to make us go crazy, just as he wanted when we were kids. Only now he seems to succeed so much better. I've been having visions for so long now you might think I've learned how to look away from them. But that's the worst part, he doesn't just make you see things, he makes you believe in them. [ominous music] - You bastard. You sound like you think this is funny. - Do I? - So what about Linda? Transmitted from the bathtub up to the attic. That's not what I call an illusion. - I'm aware of that. Maybe he's getting tired of illusions. If it's so, then from now on we don't know what's real or not. [ominous music] [ghost cackling] - [Linda] No. - I got your little wife - No. - down here, - No. - Stevie. - No! [ghost cackles] No! [soft ominous music] - How are you feeling? - I'm okay. Where's Steve? [rain pattering] - He'll be back in a minute. Do you remember what happened? - What do you mean? Why do you wanna know? - I believe you saw something. Something that scared you. Come on, we heard you screaming. [ghost cackles] - No! - She's doing fine, - No! - my boy. - Oh, no! Oh no! - I'm fucking your slut. - [Linda] No! - And she likes it. - No. No! - I'm coming! [gunk splashing] [ghost cackling] - You can't trick me. You can't trick me. You can't trick me! [suspenseful music] - It was burned. [soft music] It looked dead but it moved. - And you can see him, too? - Eric? - Yeah? - It said something to me. - It did? - He said you killed him! [dramatic music] How could you do such a thing? - Linda, I beg you. - If you wanna beg, you kneel. - Listen, we-- - Kneel! [suspenseful music] - We were kids! You tortured us in school and all we wanted to do was to play a little boys' trick. It just [mumbles]. - You think you can play your tricks on me? Well, suit yourself, you bastard. I'm not gonna fall for your illusions again. You know, it just might work with someone more easily affected, but not me. Cheers, you son of a... [ominous music] [glass breaking] [ghost cackling] [lights zapping] - It was an accident, just an accident! [kick thuds] - [Ghost] Accident? - Well, he can kill you just as easily. - We didn't mean to kill him. We didn't mean to! - But he wants to play with you. Or would you prefer to play with firecrackers? [giggles] [Eric screaming] [ghost cackling] [door creaking] [suspenseful music] [ghost cackling] - [Ghost] Welcome home, my boy. [cackling] - Linda! No, Linda! Stop it, stop it! We didn't mean it. We didn't mean it. We didn't mean it! Look, we were kids. He's playing trick with you, don't you understand? Please, please don't do that. Don't come any closer. No! He's playing a trick with you, don't you understand? No, don't come any closer! Stop it! [hand slaps] [suspenseful music] [rain pattering] - So that's what happened. Why haven't you told me about this? Steve, I want an answer. - It's a very hard memory for me and... I didn't see the use in telling you about it. - That's a great excuse. Don't bother to tell me I'm married to a killer. - I'm no killer, goddamn it. - Cut the crap, both of you. - Oh, you wanna play bullheaded? You didn't look so tough when you were jumping around up there screaming like a stuck pig. - You saw him yourself in the bathroom so you know what tricks he can play. Maybe you can tell me how to stop an evil spirit. Look, we can't sit here arguing. [ominous music] [dummy hisses] Have you got any ideas, Steve? - What? How to stop him? You would know better, wouldn't you? - That house he lived in, is it still standing? - Not exactly. Why? - Well, I just thought about a story I read before we left. It was about a killer who hanged himself in a big apartment building and his ghost started to haunt the people that lived there. [ominous music] The haunting didn't stop until the whole place was torn down. - But Andersson's house burnt down in the fire. You know, he owned a very big area out by the coast and a couple of years later they built this factory there which had to be stopped because of some pollution scandal. [scratching on wood] As far as I know there's nothing but junk out there now. - Well, was there a cellar? - Maybe there was. What do you mean? - Well, you could blow it up. - [scoffs] Blow it up? - Well, I couldn't help but notice the stuff you keep in here. Well it was just a thought. What do you think I am, a medium or something? [dramatic music] [Linda gasps] - Didn't you see it? The doll! It was right over here, it has this big knife drawn! - For Christ's sake, be careful. Don't you see what he's trying to do? That's the second time you nearly killed your wife. - But it was over here. I can't possibly have been... - I can't remember the doll sitting there, and I don't see any knife either. [ominous music] Steve, we have to do something right now. Don't you see that? - [Steve] Yeah, like blow his cellar in the air, huh? That's the most stupid idea I ever heard. - I've been in this longer than you, and I'll tell you, if we don't do something right now we'll be sent to nut house, all three of us. - I'll tell you one thing for a fact, I don't go out to that spooky place right in the middle of the night. - Everything looks better in daylight. We'll have to sleep now. But in rounds. [ominous music] [thunder rumbles] [thunder rumbles] I thought you said you didn't want anything. - Just give me the bottle, will you? - I think she got quite a shock, too. - Jesus, Eric. Do you think we've got one single chance to destroy him? - No. [men laughing] [thunder rumbles] - Why are we laughing? - I don't know. [laughs] I think we're going nuts. [visitor banging on the door] [suspenseful music] - Were you expecting someone tonight? - Stay here. - Sure you wanna go down there alone? [visitor banging on door] - Come on. [visitor banging on door] [thunder rumbles] [visitor banging on door] [thunder rumbles] [rain pattering] Oh, sorry officer. I thought it was someone else. - Do you speak English? - No, oh well, yes. I mean yes, I do. - Well, I'm sorry to bother you at this hour, but you see we're after a burglar and he ran off in this direction and we're just checking out if you've seen or heard anything. Sir? - No, I haven't. But, no nothing. [thunder rumbles] [suspenseful music] - [Ghost] Linda. Come to me, Linda. [cackles] [door creaking] Come here, Linda. [ghost cackling] - [Officer] Is there maybe someone else in the house who could help me? - [Eric] I'm afraid not. I live alone. - Hm, well if you see anything, would you be kind enough to contact us? - Of course. [floor creaks] [suspenseful music] [glass breaking] Just my dog. Go back into the kitchen! [chuckles] Nasty little dog. Officer, if anything happens, I'll contact you, okay? Hope you find the son of a bitch. [ominous music] [ghost cackling] Geez, that was close. - I'm trying to stop Linda. She just came down the stairs. - What? - [Ghost] Linda. I'm here. Come to me, Linda. Come. [cackles] [dramatic music] [Linda screams] [hand smacks] - [Eric] Are you okay? [thunder rumbles] - Oh God, this is a nightmare. Where's Steve now? - [exhales] We'll find him. Come on. [dramatic music] [ghost cackling] [Eric screaming] [hand smacks] [ominous music] - Eric? Are you here, Eric? What happened? - Nothing. Nothing. [thunder rumbles] [door creaking] [ghost cackling] Let's get out of here. [metal clatters] [ghost cackling] - [Ghost] If you wanna get out, you have to find another way. [cackles] You're dead, all of you. - That's it. I've had it. - No, Steve, wait! [water dripping] [ghost cackling] [water dripping] [ominous music] [water dripping] [metal clattering] [object banging] [door banging] [ominous music] [ghost cackling] - [Ghost] Hi, Stevie. [cackles] - Don't! [stereo clatters] It's just a burglar, Steve. [footsteps thudding] Nothing but a burglar. - I saw something else. - I'm sure you did. Give me that. - I can't take this anymore, Eric. [crying] We haven't got a chance. Why don't we just-- - Why don't you just try to calm yourself? Don't you realize we've got no choice? If you don't wanna fight against it, you might as well go cut your wrists. [ominous music] I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Steve. In a couple of hours the sun will rise. If we get out to that place I'm sure there's some way to beat him. - Everything looks better in daylight, huh? - Right. [birds chirping] - I won't ask you how you got all this stuff, but there's one thing I wanna know. - Yes? - [Steve] We're fighting a ghost, why do we need all these weapons? I mean, what can we use them for? - Let's put it this way, would you feel better if we left without them? [suspenseful synthesizer music] Shit. - Did you see any traces from that thief last night? - Sorry, officer, we didn't. - That's funny, we caught him a couple of hours later and he was totally shocked. He confessed that he had broken into a house and he told us that somebody tried to shoot him with a rifle. - Is that so? - As I understood it, he referred to your house, sir. - He did? Look, that's impossible. You must understand that. - Do you mind if I take a look at your car? - Why? Is there something wrong? - That's what I want to find out. - Oh, yeah sure. Check it out. [suspenseful music] - Miss, could you move that blanket, please? - This one? Why? - Because [dramatic music] to see what's underneath it. [Linda screams] [rifle fires] - Come on! What is this? Oh shit. [ominous music] - It was the monster! It was the monster! - Yeah, yeah. Hold on to yourself now. [suspenseful music] [Linda screams] [ghost cackles] Okay, Officer, take this. [tires screech] [officer cries out] Sorry, Officer. [chuckles] Oh shit. [Linda groans] [Linda cries out] [Linda screeches] - [Steve] What do you think you're doing, man? Are you crazy? It's dangerous up there. - No! - Turn! Turn, man! - No! No! [car crashing] [somber music] [Eric chuckles] [birds squawking] - Come on. Do you recognize it, Steve? - [Steve] This is it? - They started to build something on it. But I think these are remains from his actual house. - What kind of people come out here? - Gangs from all around, but don't worry, they're only here at nighttime. - It's not gangs I'm worried about. - So you think the cellar's down there? - Oh yeah. All houses built back then had one. If there's something here we'll find it. [ominous music] - [laughs] If there's something there you'll find it. I think we've got ourselves some American visitors. - [Steve] We're here for personal reasons. - Why don't you come along and meet our boss and he'll tell you about personal reasons. [laughs] Move it! [Linda gasps] [broken glass rattling] [ominous electric guitar music] Boss! Hey, Boss! Look, got some Americans for you. - [chuckles] Americans. Would you like to say hello to Wissy and Lex. Do you find it very hard to say hello? - Fuck you. [gang leader clicks his tongue] [gang leader laughs] [gang leader chuckles] [beer splashes] [gang leader laughs] I think you owe me an apology. That is of course if you don't wanna lose your tits. [knee thuds] [gang leader grunts] [dramatic music] [glass breaking] Get them! Get them! - [Eric] I don't care about how restricted this area may be, you better move out of here. All of you! [lighter clicking] [ominous music] - You're all dead, all of you, and you know it. [rifle fires] [women crying out] - You saw something, didn't you? [birds squawking] Let's find that cellar. [ominous music] [dogs howling] [shovels scraping] [debris clattering] - Go on. [shovel scraping] [Steve grunts] - It's no use! [dog barking] We're never gonna find it. That's how it is. [dog whimpering] This was a stupid idea anyway. Blowing his cellar in the air, what good will that do? [rocks clattering] [dog barks] [rocks clattering] [dog whimpering] [ominous music] [dogs barking] Hey, Eric. Don't you think we should be a bit careful here? It could be dangerous down there. - [Eric] Bring the dynamite down. - Now? Shouldn't we wait a bit? - [Eric] Just bring it down, will you? [ominous music] [glass breaking] [footsteps tapping] Hey, what are you waiting for? - [Steve] Linda. [bricks clattering] [bricks clattering] [suspenseful music] - What is it? - I can't get it loose. - Just stop that. You'll tear it off. It's enough to light on. - Um, how long is it gonna take before it explodes? - About six or seven minutes. [suspenseful music] All right, let's get the stuff! Come on. Hurry up! [fuse hissing] Come on, get it up. - [Ghost] Linda. [chuckles] Come to me now. Linda. [chuckles] [fuse hissing] - All right, give me your hand. She's not here. Eric, she's not here. [fuse hissing] - Calm down for Christ's sake. - What the hell do you mean? She's down here, we can't stop the explosion. You know, this was all your idea. I demand that you-- - Stop it! - I'll get you for this. [fuse hissing] Linda! Linda! Please, you've gotta hear me, Linda! - She's not here. - What do you mean? She must be. Linda! - She ain't here, we gotta get out! [fuse hissing] [suspenseful music] - [Steve] Linda! - No, wait. - Linda! Linda! I think you'd better hit me. Real hard this time. [ominous music] - We have to escape this. This can't be real. - For God's sake, Eric, we both see it, don't we? Must be real. [Linda screams] She's alive. She's alive. [suspenseful music] [Linda screams] [ominous music] [ghost cackling] [suspenseful music] [doors slam] - [Ghost] [cackles] Here, boys, catch it. - Oh! [firecrackers popping] [ghost cackles] - [Ghost] Boys, I couldn't let you play with such dangerous things. Besides, Stevie, your lovely wife told me that you prefer to play with firecrackers. [cackles] - So you, you hear that? Fooled us for the last time, you scumbag. I'll finish you right here and now. Come on out and show me your ugly face, you coward. - Steve, we better... - Get off my back. I'll deal with him if he just dares to show himself. [ghost banging] [suspenseful music] [ghost chuckles] [ghost cackling] - Don't you recognize me? [cackles] - We know it's you. What have you done to her? - You got yourself a lovely wife, Steve. I think I intend to keep her, but your time has come I'm afraid. [cackles] [Eric grunts] [ghost grunting] [dramatic music] [Eric cries out] [ghost grunting] [ominous music] [birds squawking] [rocks clattering] [water dripping] [dramatic music] - You did this. You killed her! - I [mumbles]. - She's dead! She's dead! She's dead! - First they told us to leave and when we came back here at night they were chasing that girl all around here. She screamed something about it all was an illusion, but it didn't help. Jesus, Officer, what weirdos. - I appreciate your help, but will you please excuse me? I've got lots of work to do. [ominous music] - Something wrong, sir? - I thought I saw her moving. Well, it was probably an illusion. - [chuckles] Sure it was, sir.

You wanna go to Sweden this summer? - No way. - No way? - I'd rather stay here with you. [Steve grunts] [upbeat music] [ominous music] - [Announcer] Scorched Heat. It happened one late October night. [firecracker popping] - Oh no! - [Announcer] Steve and Eric's little boys' trick turned out in a fire which killed their hated school teacher, Mr. Andersson. But 20 years later, one of them had strange visions. - How could you do such a thing? - [Announcer] Steve, who had moved to Dallas, could only draw one conclusion when he got the message from his old friend. - He must have gone crazy some way, you know? Understand? [Eric shouting] If you trying to scare me, you better stop it right now 'cause we ain't stayin' here one more-- [Linda whimpering] [Linda screams] - If anyone is crazy it's you! [dramatic music] He's back. [ominous music] - [Announcer] Not only was he back from the grave, he was back with the power of creating horrible illusions. - He doesn't just make you see things. [glass breaking] He makes you believe in them. - My God. - [Ghost] Welcome home, my boy. [cackles] - Did you see it? - No! - [Announcer] Now their lives depended on destroying that power, but how can you kill what's already dead? Scorched Heat. - Come on, what is this? [rifle fires] Oh shit. - It was the monster! It was the monster! - Yeah, yeah. Hold onto yourself now. [car crashing] Oh shit. - [Announcer] What you see can be real. - And you know it. [gang leader laughing] - [Announcer] But it could be... [rifle fires] an illusion. Deep down where the last remains of his spirit should be resting, they searched for his soul to destroy it. [door squeaking] - Let's get the stuff! [door creaking] Hurry up! - [Announcer] But could they? - Eric, she's not here. [ominous music] [ghost cackling] [glass breaking] - [Announcer] It's not easy to destroy when you don't know what's real. Scorched Heat. From Cobra Productions. It will burn you to the bone.
