In 1955, Chuck Berry's career took off following an introduction by Muddy Waters to Leonard Chess at the rhythm and blues label, Chess Records. Chuck played the swing fiddle tune, "Ida Red," a song he'd turn into a hit with his storied lyrics and name borrowed from a popular cosmetic, Maybelline. Soon after its release, Leonard Chess would hear "Maybelline" on the popular radio station in Chicago, WIND, a white radio station. Having "Maybelline" play on a white radio station was a breakthrough event for music. But when they realized that Chuck Berry was black... Many of the white stations pulled the record. It was the enthusiasm that white teenage girls had for his music that vaulted him back onto what had been all white radio. Nearly every rock hall of famer sites Chuck Berry as their main influence. We proudly present great performances from Chuck Berry and his superstar disciples. We start with Chuck Berry in 1956 as featured in the first rock music film, "Rock, Rock, Rock." Alan Freed, who originated the phrase "rock and roll," introduces Chuck Berry. Yo, gang, you all remember "Maybelline" about the young man with the guitar who couldn't catch her with his car? Well, here he is to tell us all about it with a brand new automobile, Chuck Berry and "You Can't Catch Me"! ♪ ♪ ♪ I bought a brand new airmobile ♪ ♪ It was custom made, it was a Flight DeVille ♪ ♪ With a powerful motor and some hideaway wings ♪ ♪ Push in on the button and you will hear her sing ♪ ♪ Now you can't catch me ♪ ♪ Baby, you can't catch me ♪ ♪ 'Cause if you get too close ♪ ♪ You know I'm gone like a cool breeze ♪ ♪ New Jersey Turnpike in the wee, wee hours ♪ ♪ I was rolling slowly 'cause of drizzling showers ♪ ♪ Here come a flat-top, he was moving up with me ♪ ♪ Then come waving goodbye in a little, old suped-up jitney ♪ ♪ I put my foot in my tank and I began to roll ♪ ♪ Moaning sirens, it was the state patrol ♪ ♪ So, I let out my wings and then I blew my horn ♪ ♪ Bye-Bye, New Jersey, I become airborne ♪ ♪ Now you can't catch me ♪ ♪ Baby, you can't catch me ♪ ♪ 'Cause if you get too close ♪ ♪ You know I'm gone like a cool breeze ♪ ♪ Flying with my baby last Saturday night ♪ ♪ Wasn't a gray cloud floating in sight ♪ ♪ Big full moon shining up above ♪ ♪ Cuddle up, honey, be my love ♪ ♪ Sweetest little thing I've ever seen ♪ ♪ I'm gonna name you Maybelline ♪ ♪ Flying on the beam set on flight control ♪ ♪ Radio tuned to rock 'n' roll ♪ ♪ Two, three hours a-passed us by ♪ ♪ Altitude dropped to 505 ♪ ♪ Fuel consumption way too fast ♪ ♪ Let's get on home before we run out of gas ♪ ♪ Now you can't catch me ♪ ♪ No, baby, you can't catch me ♪ ♪ 'Cause if you get too close ♪ ♪ You know I'm gone like a cool breeze ♪ His trademark move, the duck walk. When I was a kid, I used to scoot under the table and whenever company would come around, you know, my sisters or parents would tell me, "Go under the table," and I'd do it. It was like an entertainment for the family, aunts or whatever, and one time at the Paramount, it was, when I first did it, Brooklyn Paramount, I did it in the act on an instrumental and played my guitar, and I got a big ovation and, since, I've been doing it. While Chuck had tremendous success in the early days of rock 'n' roll, his star shined even brighter when the Beatles and Stones had some of their earliest hits covering Chuck's classics. ♪ I said the joint was rocking ♪ ♪ Going round and round ♪ ♪ Yeah, reeling and a-rocking ♪ ♪ What a crazy sound ♪ ♪ And they never stopped rocking ♪ ♪ Till the moon went down ♪ ♪ Well, it sounds so sweet ♪ ♪ I had to take me a chance ♪ ♪ Rose out of my seat ♪ ♪ I just had to dance ♪ ♪ Started moving my feet ♪ ♪ Whoa, to clapping my hands ♪ ♪ I said the joint was rocking ♪ ♪ Going round and round ♪ ♪ Yeah, reeling and a-rocking ♪ ♪ What a crazy sound ♪ ♪ And they never stopped rocking ♪ ♪ Till the moon went down ♪ ♪ ♪ Yeah, at 12 o'clock ♪ ♪ Yeah, the place was packed ♪ ♪ Front doors was locked ♪ ♪ Yeah, the place was packed ♪ ♪ And when the police knocked ♪ ♪ Those doors flew back ♪ ♪ But they kept on rocking ♪ ♪ Going round and round ♪ ♪ Yeah, reeling and a-rocking ♪ ♪ What a crazy sound ♪ ♪ And they never stopped rocking ♪ ♪ Till the moon went down ♪ ♪ And they go on rocking ♪ ♪ Going round and round ♪ ♪ Yeah, reeling and a-rocking ♪ ♪ What a crazy sound ♪ ♪ And they never stopped rocking ♪ ♪ Till the moon went down ♪ ♪ Well, the joint stayed a-rocking ♪ ♪ Going round and round ♪ ♪ Yeah, reeling and a-rocking ♪ ♪ What a crazy sound ♪ ♪ And they never stopped rocking ♪ ♪ Till the moon went down ♪ ♪ Oh!
