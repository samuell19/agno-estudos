A DAIEI COMPANY, LTD. PRODUCTION MONTH 5 DAY 8, 1615 THE SUMMER CAMPAIGN OF OSAKA HAD REACHED THE CLIMAX. Father, the tower! Oh, my! Mother! Reporting! The tower has been destroyed. It's been burned to the ground! Kill all of them! Not only the Toyotomi, but also the other lords who took their side! Especially get Sanada Yukimura! - Father! - Get a doctor! Saizo. Don't die! War means we have to win! Why? Is it your intent to die with the castle? No, I'm not going to die! My lord, are you going to give up to leyasu without fighting back? Lord, please hurry! Well, when are we going to find Yukimura's body? Sir. We're looking everywhere in the castle, so we'll find him soon. Soon? It's been quite a while since the castle has fallen. Hidetada! Tell my army that whoever finds Sanada Yukimura's body will get a 500 koku reward right away! Tell them "Right away." Understood? Sir! Reporting! Hanzo, come closer! Our men have informed me that a small boat went down the Ajigawa River at dawn. A boat went down the Ajigawa River at dawn? Yes, there were three men in the boat. Two were impossible to identify, but the one who rowed the boat was dressed in black. It must be Kirigakure! He did it! Kirigakure Saizo!

This is the only place. But, Satsuma is so far. Where else could they go? Once they left Osaka, they went through Setouchi or Kisuido. But there's only one place where Yukimura feels safe. After Sekigahara, the relationship between Shimazu and Toyotomi clans has become very close and we have to be careful. Even though Shimazu's Ishi Nyudo has retired, he still is alive. He lives in the castle surrounded by a natural fortress, and won't let anybody in. He's quietly waiting for a chance to rebel. Hanzo! See what he's doing? Wait until night! Kirigakure, is this the right direction? Don't worry, sir. We'll get to the port of Saika very soon. Once we arrive, there are many illegal trading boats to the Ryukyu Islands. It will be very easy to get to Satsuma from there. What is it? Someone is following us by boat. One... Two... Three boats. Father! Quiet, please! 1, Saizo, will go look. If they're the enemy, I will stop them. Please wait here for a moment! What's wrong?! It must be Kirigakure! Be careful! Kirigakure! Kirigakure! Daisuke! SATSUMA Oh, Kirigakure! Good job! Without your help, one of the great warriors of this world would have been lost. Since you've come as far as Satsuma, you must have some plans. Yes. After we lost the Summer Campaign of Osaka, I tried to commit suicide, but Kirigakure said to fight back. So I decided to do that. That's great! Ever since the Battle of Sekigahara we're waiting for the right time. I'll help you any way I can! Thank you so much. From now on, war depends on the quality of firearms and ammunition. I believe that taking control of the 'Tanegashima' is the fastest way to win the war. That's right! Lehisa! Now, Sanada and Shimazu clans have joined. We'll take over the whole country soon! Father, he is not Lord Sanada! Oh, that's right. Minami Haruyuki-dono and Amamiya Teruzo. Father, a merchant from Tanegashima will be here soon to show his new guns before they are contributed to leyasu. I may check him out secretly. Go ahead! This gun is the new style? Yes. This is a prototype. I brought it as your special gift. Thank you so much. I'll accept it. But, please tell Lord leyasu that my products are of high quality. Oh, yes. Let me see your goods. It will shoot three rounds at once. What a great weapon! We got the blueprint from Portugal and we made it ourselves. I see. Well, Hisanao-dono... By any chance, can I see your blueprint? There's no way. Guns are the lives of the people in Tanegashima. Even at Lord Shimazu's request, I must respectfully decline. How is it? Oh, it is a great gun! There is no comparison to the usual firearms. The performance of this new weapon can match three men. I really want to get this new gun. If we can get exclusive control of this new product, our army will equal 100,000 men. However, I wonder how Portugal can make this fine a weapon since they don't have high quality iron? But Tanegashima is strictly prohibited from trading with anyone other than Portugal? Yes, I know. If we can solve this mystery, we can control Tanegashima and their new guns. That's right. Lehisa send a secret message to Date, Fukushima, and Kato that the day of our revolution is near! Yes, and when will it come. Only the 'Daijo-daijin' is above the 'Seii-taishogun'. I'm sure leyasu will be appointed as the chancellor. In order to accept this promotion, he will be coming to Kyoto within six months to a year. That's the time to move. We have to be ready until that time. Yes. Ifitis so, we must go to Tanegashima as soon as possible. SUNPU Tanegashima is a great place for guns. There's no comparison to the ones from England by Miura Anjin. It is my great pleasure to show you our products. Since your great victory at Osaka, the whole country is under our Lord leyasu, and we can enjoy peace once again. For your great victory, I brought these guns as gifts for you, sir. Well, well. Who knows when we might need them again? However, since we searched the entire country, day and night we've captured almost all of the Toyotomi and their allies. Well, well. Sometimes the prey you really want escapes from the trap. By the way, Satsuma will be the perfect place for hiding out. You have to pay extra attention to your region. Of course. I put tight security and stationed extra men all over. 1 heard a rumor that somebody named Minami Haruyuki is staying at your castle. I doubt leyasu knows about him. No, he clearly said Minami Haruyuki. I'm sure leyasu knows the whole thing. Why would he know about this? Lord Sanada has never even left the guesthouse. There was only you and I and the priest making tea at the time. That priest has been with our clan for a very long time and has never left this area. He can't be a spy. Maybe not the priest, but I think that there are spies. We should warn Lord Sanada to be very careful. But, I put a lot of men as security around our border. I wonder how they broke through. "lehisa is in secret discussions with Yoshihiro." Oh, young lady! Good afternoon. Are you going shopping for your father today? No. I remembered today is the anniversary of my nanny's death. Oh, that's nice of you to come here and she is happy in heaven. I wish I could show her what a fine young lady you've grown up to be. 1 wish she was here today. See you later. Oh, are you going home now? 1 don't want my father to worry. Bye. Young lady! Please wait. Please take this to your father. What a great bird! Please tell him that I shot it near the border today. Thank you. Bye. Please take care. Jigen-ryu Dojo KAIEDA lkkansai I'm home now. Our old gardener shot this near the border today. He said it was for you, father. He said he shot it around the border, right? Yes. Ikkansai-dono! What good timing! Our lord wants to see you. I was on my way to pick you up. Please come. Traitors! Die! An old proverb says: "Doubt those around you like thieves." But they were our clan's most trustworthy members. I just can't believe that they were spies. Besides, since leyasu imposed martial law to control the daimyo, the Shimazu clan came close to being severely punished. But Kirigakure saved us! Kirigakure, thank you. You are the lifesaver of the Shimazu clan. Yes, but the problem is from now on. I believe that leyasu knows more than we give him credit for. Not only who Minami Haruyuki is, but our plans as well. That's right. We have to come up with some new plans soon. Otherwise, we'll fall into leyasu's trap. By the way, we have to get to Tanegashima. I'll go by myself. By yourself? If we're together, we'll get spotted quite easily. I can move much faster alone. I'll come back with the secrets of Tanegashima. Until then, please stay somewhere safe. We have no choice. Sanada-dono, let Kirigakure handle this. Well... Where is a safe place for Lord Sanada? How about Ibusuki? That's a great place. We have a place with a hot spring called Ibusuki. We have a cabin there, and it's a perfect place to hide. I'll take you there tomorrow. Thank you very much. When are you leaving for Tanegashima? As soon as I can find a ship going there. Don't die! Your father didn't want you to get involved, so he was hiding it from you! - Who are you? - Kirigakure Saizo. I'm the one who found out your father's crime. Being a ninja, we must not have human emotions. We have to accomplish our mission, no matter what. Like your father, I can't stop until I die! But you have to live, and find happiness as a woman! How can I live without my father? If you hadn't come to Satsuma, my father would be alive today. You killed my father! That's right. But I have to do my job! Being a ninja, I have no choice! Young lady! Come with us! This girl had nothing to do with it! Please do not interfere with us. I'll talk to your lord! It's an order from our lord! - Stop! - Out of my way! TANEGASHIMA That's very delicious. Do you want some? Hey. Are you running from the authorities? Don't worry. They want to follow anyone from outside of Tanegashima. Where did you come from? Satsuma, to make some money. No...! Let me go! You...! Sister! Stop it! Get lost! Well, you're very good. Thank you so much. Are you sisters? This is my little sister, Manazuru. I am Akemi. Who was the Chinese man? His name is Ryuhi. He says he's a businessman, but he has such a bad temper. Why don't you go to the authorities? No, the authorities can't do anything about the Chinese. They owe something to them. Can't help. I'm going home. So soon? Wait! I didn't get your name. I don't care about my name. Tell me! Teruzo is my name. Would you come again? Well, I have my job and I can't drink all the time. After you finish your job, you can go back to Satsuma. I want to go back, too. I hope somebody will take me there. Someday, somebody will take you back there. "I sneaked into a gun factory today. "It has security as tight as that of a fortress. "The blast furnace is especially well protected. "I believe that's clear evidence of secret use of the blast furnace. "Besides, the Chinese man named Ryuhi needs to be investigated." Teruzo-san! You came! Maybe the man is a Shimazu clan spy. Then, what is it? The explosion at the gun factory could have been his doing. So, what do you want to say? If they find out we're illegally trading with China, the Shimazu clan will attack us. So that is why. Which side do you want to take, China or Japan?! What is it? Money. Please use this money and go to the mainland with your sister. Find some happiness over there. But, don't you need this money for yourself, Teruzo-san? 1 can make it again. Thank you. I'll take it. Well, I have to go. Wait! Do you need anything else? Are you coming with me? 1 have my job to do. I'll wait until you finish your job. Don't waste your time. I'll wait for you! Don't wait for me! And find some happiness! Don't forget that you are 'Kunoichi'. Your father, Takebe Yotoji, was killed at Osaka Castle by Kirigakure Saizo. I promised over his dead body that his daughters will avenge him. Now the day has come within less than a year. Yotoji will be so happy in heaven. Is he here on this island? Yes. Where? Teruzo is the name he's using. What? He is Kirigakure Saizo. Sister! Ordinary techniques won't work against him. You have to use your feminine side as a weapon. Don't forget that you are ninja. We have to give up on our pride as women. That is correct. This is a fatal poison from the Habu snake of the Ryukyu Islands. When it gets into the body, death will occur in a matter of seconds. Do you understand? It has to get inside the body. Yes. Why did you come to Tanegashima? For guns. It has nothing to do with you. You just have to kill him. That's all. What's wrong? Are you getting scared? For a female ninja there is no freedom. Not like this candle, which is free to go out at any moment. "There's no doubt that they are trading with China. "I'll be back soon with strong evidence. "This will be my last message to you." "Kirigakure." I can't wait! We're almost there. Yes. Show me the map. Date, Fukushima, and Kato have replied that they will join us. Namba, Hachisuka, Mori, and Kuroda will join us later. When we revolt against leyasu. The new guns will be the key to winning this war. Osaka Castle's fall was almost ten months ago. Leyasu will become the Daijo-daijin soon. Anyway, we're looking forward to hearing from Kirigakure. The Shimazu think they can fool me. Yes! It's time to give them a hard lesson. We can punish the Tanegashima and at the same time, we can crush the Shimazu's ambition. Besides, we can push Date and Fukushima into a corner as well. These are all perfect jobs for you, Priest Konchin-Suden. Preaching to the people has been my long time work. I should do this. Please leave for Satsuma at once. Akemi! What are you doing? Kirigakure won't be here forever. There are plenty of chances to kill him. Are you a real ninja? Aren't you ashamed of yourself in front of your sister? Manazuru is a great lady ninja! By this time, she's probably slain Kirigakure! My sister is late. Teruzo-san. We can go home because of your generosity. Thank you so much. 1 did it because I wanted to. If you thank me too much, it will make me uncomfortable. This saké is our treat. Have some. Please. All right. He's dead! Kirigakure Saizo is dead! What are you doing? Our father is avenged! You are happy, aren't you? Look! 1 don't die so easily. Manazuru! The poison...! Manazuru! Manazuru! You've not only killed my father, but my sister as well..! Who are you? Takebe Yotoji's daughters. I see. That's why you've been friendly with me. At that time, I really did fall in love with you! I thought I could be happy with you! When I found out you killed my father, I couldn't control myself! I couldn't kill you, even though my sister pushed me to! So my sister tried to kill you because I didn't do it! Wait! Just like my father, you'll be killed someday! You will be killed! Ninja is written as "Endure over the mind" in Chinese characters. I'm always ready to die. Akemi! Now is the time to harden your heart and become a beast. Be evil and slay Kirigakure! Don't forget the way of a female ninja! You already raised the price of iron 3% less than a month ago, and now you want to raise it another 2%! That's absurd! Then I have no choice, but to quit doing business with you. As you know, you can't make guns if you don't have our Chinese iron. What will happen to Tanegashima? I want to know your response. We have no choice. We have to stop making guns. What will happen to those lords who already ordered your new guns. Hidden behind the Shimazu, you took a lot of prepaid orders. Not only from leyasu, but from lords all over the country. I felt sorry for Tanegashima, so I've been selling you our iron out of my kindness. Wait! I'll decide a new price for our business. Yes. I made a new contract. You only have to sign the paper. Let's make more money! What's wrong? Die, Kirigakure Saizo! Akemi, do it! He's running away! He's running away! What? Chase him! Yotoji is crying. Even as a female ninja, we can't forgive your mistake. It was not a mistake. You're making an excuse! I betrayed you! Die! Well, you're saying he isn't Sanada Yukimura, aren't you? Then, hand over Minami Haruyuki right now. I'll explain to Lord leyasu, and make the whole thing as peaceful as I possibly can. What do you say? I believe that since he is not the one, we don't have to give him to you, High Priest. Then, I can't help you anymore. Wait, please! I'll do whatever you say. Oh, you'll give me Minami Haruyuki, won't you? Yes! But please, about my clan... I promise you that there won't be any punishment toward your clan! I'll leave some men in Shimazu to take Minami Haruyuki back. Besides, I don't care if he's dead or alive. Do you understand? Father! At the 18th generation, I can't crush my clan. I can't! He was taken to the castle by horse a while ago. By horse? I have denied their request. But leyasu is stubborn, and he never gives up. Of course I want to fight back, and I tried to do so. But I'm one of the small lords, and he is shogun. The consequences are clear. If go to Sunpu, there won't be any punishment for the Shimazu clan. That's right. I'll leave for Sunpu tomorrow. Please tell leyasu's men that I'll be ready to go tomorrow. Then, I'll see you tomorrow. Lehisa. My lord! When did you get back? Just now, sir. Why was the priest from leyasu in Shimazu? Saizo, I got all of your messages by carrier pigeon. Thank you. As you suspected, Tanegashima has been secretly trading with China. Please look at these, sir. One is for iron, and the other is for business contracts with China. Thank you so much. If we show this evidence of illegal trading, all the new guns will fall into the Shimazu clan. With this clear evidence, please ask the Shimazu clan to officially contact Tanegashima. My lord? What's going on? It's over. Everything is over now. It's over? An order came from leyasu, and I'll be leaving for Sunpu tomorrow morning. What do you mean?! How about Lord Shimazu who promised to fight leyasu? It was Lord Shimazu that agreed to hand me over to leyasu. Saizo... If my life will save all the people of the Shimazu clan, I'll be happy to... No! I strongly disagree with you! Why did we escape from Osaka Castle? Why did we come to Satsuma? It was to rise up against leyasu and the Tokugawa clan! Even though the Shimazu have betrayed us, if we can get the new guns from Tanegashima we still can win! The Fukushima and Date aren't cowards like the Shimazu! My lord! So, go back to being my old lord who promised to kill leyasu, please! The lords of Date and Fukushima will be the same. Seeing Lord Shimazu's reaction, really made me understand. And Lord leyasu is becoming so big he can't be reached anymore. When Lord Nobunaga died, the Oda clan died as well. When Taiko Hideyoshi died, the Toyotomi clan died, too. But even if leyasu died today... The Tokugawa clan will never die. Why do you say that?! Lord you're unfair! Even if I am to be alone, I'll kill leyasu! Saizo! Please, from today, be a human, and find a new life! Please give me your sword, sir. My lord, Saizo is here! Let's fight leyasu! My lord! My lord! I'm disobeying your order. I'll live as the last ninja, and kill leyasu! Well, Yukimura is dead. But what did you do? At Saika, you let him escape. At Tanegashima, you were fooled by him, and at Satsuma, you let Yukimura die. Kirigakure is making a fool of you. I'm so sorry, sir. Kirigakure will come to Sunpu, and I'll kill him this time! Shut up! Ninja are not useful anymore! Please give me one more chance! I promise to bring you Kirigakure's head! Shut up! Don't show your filthy face here anymore! We have to slay Kirigakure with our own hands. Otherwise, we'll lose face. Is he coming? Yes, he's coming. All right? We must not get help from the samurai. If you're pushed into a corner, don't make any noise. All right, come out! Takihachi, Goroku, you watch here. All right? Go on! Sir! You filthy one! Are you still there? Please be careful, sir. Shut up! A lowly ninja can't fight a general like myself! My lord! Your Excellency! What happened to you?! Come this way, hurry! What's wrong with him? 1 don't know. But some kind of poison got into his wound. He was fine a little while ago. What kid of poison is it? Will he live? We took out part of the wound, so if the poison didn't get to other parts. What I'm going to say shall be my "Last Will and Testament." Listen carefully. First: About the daimyo. Kato and Fukushima will be severely punished, and their clans terminated. The Shimazu and Date will be handled carefully. Take a hostage from the Shimazu... and give our Princess Furi to Lord Date in marriage. Princess Furi? But she's already married to Lord Asano! Take her back from Asano and give her to the Date! Next are Christians. I let them come to Japan for the purpose of trade. But they've become too much today. Christianity is not to save souls, but to take over our country. Suden! Yes! I immediately make a law to prohibit Christians from Japan. Yes! Hidetada! Yes, father! If anybody goes against your orders, kill them at once! Whether they are tozama daimyo, or fudai it makes no difference. To rule the country... you must be merciless, all right? Yes! Konchin-sama. Your Excellency, we received word from Kyoto that you have been appointed Daijo-daijin. Oh... Chancellor! That's great! That's great! You may leave now. My life won't last much longer. I want to enjoy my little time alone. Kirigakure Saizo! Ninja... Is that you? Yes. I'm the one who put the poison into your wound. What a waste of your time! What? You're going to die! As you deserve! I'm the one who killed you! You're a fool! I'm already 75 years old. Even if I'm not killed, I'm going to die soon anyway. Don't be such a loser! Be a loser? I've got the whole country. I've got status... and I made the Tokugawa government's strong base. What else could I want? Ldid it! I really did it! My lord! I, Kirigakure Saizo, have won! I won! MONTH 4 - DAY 17, 1616 TOKUGAWA IEYASU DIED. THE NEWS HAD SPREAD ALL ACROSS THE NATION, BUT THERE IS NO DISTURBANCE AT ALL. I won! I won! Special Thanks to: and Batman THE END
