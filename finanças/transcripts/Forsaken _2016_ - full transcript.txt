We didn't choose this love... It chose us. It spoke for us... and it guided our hand. We saw each other for who we really are... and nothing can keep us apart. Get down, get down, get down! Let's go! - Are you men or are you boys? - Men! Are you warriors? - Or are you cowards? - Warriors! I want to see blood out on that field tonight. Yes, sir! My boy is going to lead you to victory out there tonight. Are you ready, son? - Are you ready? - Yes, sir! - Are you ready? - Yes, sir. Then get out there and show me! We'll smash the Red Bulls. Yeah! Let's go! You let me down. You let yourself down. You let the whole damn school down! Ah! Please. You're too chicken-shit running in yourself. Oh, my God! I gotta play better. Mac. It's okay. I can take it. It would be worse if he knew about us. What if I had a way out? No way. No way. - You got in? - Yeah. Really, it's, uh, just a routine English program. - Six more months. - Only six more months. High school will be over. Then we can be done with this town and everyone in it. I got a surprise for you too. What is it? It's so retro. I love it. I think it belonged to my mom. How do you know? Sitting on top of this. She's beautiful. This is the first picture of her I'd ever seen. I think it's why he makes me sleep in the pool house. He says it's to focus me on football but I think it's 'cause I remind him of her. She was an amazing woman. I wouldn't know. She loved you more than her own life. And that's all that matters. - Yeah. - Yeah. Retro selfie. Flash is bright. Gran, you want some breakfast? Oh, there you are, Sarah. Grandma... It's me, Missy. Did you move my lavender shawl? Here. Gran. - Grandma. - Oh! I have to go to school, okay? Do not forget your bus pass on the way to your doctor's appointment, right? Okay. Twenty two rights, Green two, River. Twenty two. Left. Draw the defenders away from the box. The lineman must apply strong zone principles. Two left spread. QBS to make a quick indecisive decision. Could be as if he has... Red 22, hut! Hut! Get your ass up, boy. LSU, USC, Georgia. Gone. 'Cause you're too afraid to gut something out on your own. We still have a shot at a few of these. OSU is looking for a backup. Dad, maybe I don't wanna play in college. You got somethin' better to do, boy? No, sir. I saw you after the game. Kissin' on that squirrelly girl. You think she cares about your scholarship? Little gig just wants to be Prom Queen. Hell, I don't know how to get through to you. This parenting thing wasn't supposed to be my job. Sometimes, I'm glad she's not here to see what her son has become. Do I need to step in here, son? - No, sir. - Do I need to step in here? No, sir, I'm sorry, I... I'm sorry, she's a jersey chaser. I'll get rid of her. There's gonna be a lot of skirts chasing you. You respect the game... - Always. - Yes, sir. That's Troy. I gotta go. You're just gonna leave your bowl? Hey, Mac. Hey, Candy. Still can't believe your pops won't let you have a car. He owns the dealership. He should be driving me to school. San Diego's coming to Friday's game. Throw me a touchdown pass, we'll call it even, alright? Yeah. Hey, Mac. You got a second, buddy? Rough game on Friday. Yeah. There's a method to his madness, you know. It's your dad that got me into college. Yeah? And how's your head doing? - Sorry. - No. I mean, I... I get it. I remember being so angry after games I wanted to kill somebody. But, everything has a way of falling into place. Do you know that we're getting married? That's really great, Duff. What I'm trying to say is that... everything happens for a reason so... don't be too hard on yourself, alright? Yeah. - I, uh, got to get to class. - Yeah. - Have a good day, buddy. - Thanks. I chose Jane Eyre as my hero from literature. Not, um... for the hardships she endured or because Jane was an orphan whose family abandoned her but... because... But, b-because Jane created her own identity when women weren't allowed to have one. She... refused to be chained down by the rules pushed on her by others. She took matters into her own hands and wrote her own future. Hmm. She made her own moral code that guided her to happiness and... despite all the odds even though the man she fell for was above her station she found her true love. Like you'll ever know what love feels like. It's probably similar to that feeling you get when you're being passed around by the football team. - Girls. - Nice comeback. Your mum help you with that one? Candice. Alright, good work today. Mr. Adams, Miss Martinez, please, be prepared with your reports on Wednesday. I'm sorry, Missy. Kids. Uh... How are things at home? How's your grandma? She called me Sarah this morning. Well, you're doing an incredible job taking care of her. Just don't forget to look after yourself too. Any new friends besides Jane Eyre? There is someone but I can't say. A beautiful maiden and her secret love just like your heroine. And does, uh, Mac feel the same way? You can't say anything. He's... But you should never have to keep love a secret. Right now, we do. Besides, I don't need the whole town to love me. Just him. ♪ Smile that makes time stand still ♪ ♪ Hide ♪ ♪ From me ♪ ♪ Never leave ♪ Just a minute, Miss Martin. I'm sorry. Take your time. You can't be in here. Yes, I can. I just wanted to see what all the damn fuss was about. Frankly, I don't see it. We might screw the girl from across the tracks but that's as far as it goes. You're beneath us. Alice, I need you. Girl talk incoming. I best go. Anyway, I just wanted to tell you how excited I am about the engagement, you know. - Duff's like a son to me. - Are you kidding? He can't stop talking about your glory days. Oh... And hey, it's, uh dad now. You got it, coach. So, Missy. What's so important you forgot to knock? I'm leaving school. I... I got an early acceptance to Stanford and I have enough credits to graduate so I'm enrolling for spring semester. Well, congratulations. That's amazing. Great. Wow, um... Is this about Mac? Is this decision running towards something that you want? Or running away from something you're afraid of? It's just what I have to do. If you take away nothing else at least you deserve to be happy and you deserve to have love in your life. Don't let anyone or anything stand between you and your happiness. I miss you already. So my boy Duffy gets up legs like a newborn calf shakes off the concussion drives down the field and scores the damn winning touchdown himself. I've had enough hits for a lifetime. Thank you, babe. Only reason I know what happened 'cause I saw it Monday morning on game film. How about Mac this year? Five in one star. That's a hell of a job, coach. Hell of a job. I, uh, I haven't told Mac yet but, oh, hell, I called in some favors and I got the call today. My son's gonna be an OSU Cowboy. - Alright. - Alright. I hate him. Should have told me at school. It's a little hard to get a word in with you at school. No, this is different. You're mine. I don't care if he hurts me but not you. Mac. Let's just leave. Tonight. ♪ You called today just to say ♪ ♪ You moved faraway ♪ ♪ And remember when... ♪ - OSU. - OSU! Gonna be a Cowboy. ♪ Say I'd go anywhere ♪ Don't you ever get tired of the whinin' and complainin'? I mean, I wouldn't exactly call it whining. I mean, that young girl that came into my office today she told me that she's graduating early to attend Stanford on full scholarship. Gran, please, come with us. We're leaving. We're not coming back. Can any of your boys say that? My boys wouldn't ditch their team like that. - But good for her. - Okay. Now let's celebrate. - You want a plate? - No. This is good. Mac Attack! I got pie and game tape. And I got big news. Come on, son. Is this about your girlfriend leavin'? I know it's tough, but... you think they're gonna be there forever and then they ain't. Let's just concentrate on something that won't quit on us, son. Let's have a beer together. You're really gonna make me come in there? Got it. You ungrateful little prick. Dad. - You can't do-- - Like hell, I can't! This is my property, boy. Damn it, son. You're gonna throw your life away on a piece of ass. I'll be damned. You might have some of your old man in you after all. I'm gonna teach you a lesson you ain't ever gonna forget. Dad, stop. I can't believe you. Oh, my God. You ungrateful coward! We gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go. Oh, my God. No. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Come on. Okay. Ahh... Come on, baby. Get every drop off. It's not washing off. See? Blood washes away like anything else. We have to burn everything. We still have some old clothes of my dad, so... You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. If we leave now, they'll know it was us. I know. Do you want me to take you home? No. Come here. Duff. I know how close you guys were. I can handle it. Well, uh, guess I need to head over to the house tell young Mac he's now an orphan. I'll do it, sheriff. You sure? Yeah. Alright. Bill, how much longer are you gonna be here? Oh, crap. You can do this. Morning, Duff. What's going on? There was a, an incident last night involving your father. Okay. Mac, I'm sorry to tell you this, but... he was killed last night. Oh, Mac. I'm so sorry. We're gonna get through this. I'm sorry, I-I don't think we've met. This my girlfriend, Duff. Oh, I... I didn't know you had one. That's... that's good. Look, I want you to know that you're more than welcome to come and stay with Alice and I. Want you to think of us as family. Okay. Absolutely. We'll get through this. Hey when you called me your girlfriend... that's all I ever wanted. I can't take back what happened. Even if I could, I wouldn't. What happens next is up to you. Just know I did it because I love you. Wait. I can't live without you. I don't want to. Come on. This is all yours now. No. It's ours. Wait. Wait... What's wrong? Marry me. What? - Marry me. - What? I can't get it out of my head. What, Duncan? Just seein' him... laying there. It's bloody, and it's cold. I wish I didn't see him like that. He told me to call him dad. He would. How's Mac doing? Boy bawled his eyes out. But he's stronger than he thinks. Apparently, he's got a new girlfriend. Missy. Yeah. How'd you know? Some kids actually do come to counseling. - She takes counseling? - Mm-hmm. What for? Baby, you know, I can't talk about that. Yeah, it's just I've... I've never seen this girl before and all of a sudden, she's... Honey. Honey. Just know she's... really good for Mac right now. Yeah. Bye, dad. Come on, Gran. This is your home now too, grandma. You okay? I knew your dad, Duncan. He gave me my first job, and I just... See you, coach. Dude. - Mac, seriously? - Yeah. Hey, good luck. Did you ever find out if this plastic belonged to the car? No. It doesn't. It doesn't belong to any other vehicle in the lot either. I think it maybe it could belong to one of our killers. I'm sending it all to Tulsa Forensics now. Mrs. Pearson is going to rehab. It's crazy... Missy. Over here. Wait, Mac, I know you're going through some stuff but-- Candice, scoot over. You heard him? - Hi, Missy. - Hey... Excuse me, deputy. Missy. I wasn't expecting you. Mm, Mac's having a really hard time with all this and he asked if I could come instead. I hope that's okay. This is usually done with family. I guess we can make an exception this time. These are the items that were deemed non-crucial to the case. Um... I'm sure Mac would like to have them back. Definitely. Uh, his wallet's in here. Cash, credit cards. Weren't very good thieves, were they? What do you mean? They just left the money. How well did you know Duncan? T-though we did get pretty close there right at the end. Really? I... I just don't ever remember him saying anything about Mac having a girlfriend. Yeah. Well, Duncan didn't really talk about much other than football now, did he? Not really sure if he cared about anything else. Thank you, deputy. I'll be sure Mac gets these. Come on. Same make, same model, same everything. - I love you. - Love you too. I got one more surprise for you. Are you sure? Wait, stop, stop. I would die for you. Stop. Stop, stop. - I would kill for you. - Stop. Get off, get off! What? Did I do something wrong? No, it's not you, it's just... - H-hi. - Hi. Come on in. I brought you a little something. - Oh, thank you. - Oh, thank you so much. I figured we could all spend some time together. Of course. So, uh, no more pool house, huh? No, I felt kinda weird in there big empty place just sitting here. Figured it'd be hard you bein' here all alone. No, I'm not alone. Missy's really helped me through it all. Oh, and this is Grandma Sherrie. - Hi. - Wow. - One big happy family. - Really great, Mac. You know, you need all the support you can get right now. Thank you, Alice. You have no idea how good it is to see you. Hey, guys. Come on, man. - You okay? - Yeah. Oh, sorry. It's just a new present here. - Let's eat. - Yeah. Come on in, guys. So photography, huh? I don't know, it's something new. New is good. - Well... - That bad, huh? Flashin' lights got a a way of messing with my head. You got to admit, it was pretty funny though, right? Yeah. You know what, you keep it. - Thanks. - Yeah. I'll catch the guys that did this. I know what you did, Missy. I'm proud of you. Staying here instead of leaving for Stanford after what happened and the way you've helped Mac. Mac would have done the same for me. I know that Mac and Duncan had a very strained relationship but still, it's incredibly hard to lose a parent. I want you to know that we're doing everything in our power to catch the guys that did this. I just wanna forget about it. I just wanna make sure that you're not being confused by any bad influences. What bad influences? With your dad gone, there's gonna be a lot of people around trying to take advantage of you. Well, Missy isn't one of them. I'm not accusing anyone. Come on, let's go inside. How do you do that? What're you talking about? How you just turn it off like that? Just got to keep moving. - Thanks again for dinner. - Oh, of course, sweetheart. Okay. I'll see at school tomorrow, okay? - Okay. - Alright, have a good night. - If you need anything. - Yeah, of course. - Bye. Drive safe. - Bye, guys. They're so great together. He doesn't like me. Duncan's body isn't even cold yet. - Of course he does. - Really? What were you two talking about outside? Hey, what's wrong with you? He just needs some time to get to know you. It's just, uh... Nothin'. I'm just tired. He could be dangerous. Remember that. There's only us. Hey, Missy, I was wondering if maybe you'd like to go to lunch with me today? Me and the girls are going off campus. Uh, yeah, that, that would be nice. Good, because we need someone to help... Mac, Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. You hear we got murdered Friday? Yeah, sorry, man. Dude, I'm not Duffy or Coach Clyde. I get it. Your pops could be kind of a dick. - It's not like that. - Yeah, right? I can see daddy's love all over you, man. - Troy, I quit... for good. - Yeah. But the thing is all those scouts were coming to see you. I need those scouts at the games or I ain't going to college. Well, you better start studying then. Mac, what the hell happened to you? On his way to the theater of Pompeii Julius Caesar boasts "The ides of March have come yet still I stand." To which the soothsayer replies "Yes, Caesar but the ides have not yet gone." Julius Caesar, betrayed and murdered by his closest friends. So, what is Shakespeare trying to tell us? Your bros don't always have your back. In a sense. What else? Mac! Mac! Mac! Dammit son, answer the man. Alas! Not everyone hath the stomach... for Shakespeare. Whoa! Oh, my God. Sorry. You okay? I don't know. I guess... I guess I'm just not used to all this attention. The whole school watches Mac like... like the sun rises and sets with him. This place is pretty sad, isn't it? Just remember, the boys might walk all high and mighty during the day, but they always want to cuddle at night. So, really, we're the ones with all the power. Touch-up? We're seeing a lot of damage from multiple concussions. Some were diagnosed earlier, and others we're discovering now. I'm so sorry, Duffy. You're showing signs of atrophy, not improvement. It's my recommendation that you have a drastic lifestyle change. Take some time off from work. Get some rest. Do you understand what I am saying? This is not going to go away. You're gonna be so good. Hey, babe. Hey, what's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. - Hey. - I'm fine. Hey! I see you, Mac. And we may have to fake it for the town but you don't have to hide from me. I saw him. My dad. It's okay. The blood, it's not washing off. My neck, it's like it's on fire. Something's crawling around in my mind like a damn scorpion. I can't get him out. Everything's gonna be okay, baby. See, isn't that better? This isn't as easy for me. I don't think I can keep doing it. Yes, you can. No. No. I'm not strong like you. Are you kidding me? You just have a different kind of strength. What are you doing? I can't do this right now. I'll take care of everything. Hey. What do you think? Time to turn in? I'll be up in a bit. You need to listen to your doctor. Rest, relax. Gotta move on, babe. Okay. I'll go to bed. You know, you sound like them. - What? - Mac and his new girlfriend. His dad gets murdered and they act like they don't care and now you too. Of course they do, and I do too. Yeah, I'm sure Missy's over there bawling her eyes out in that big-ass mansion. - Gold-digging whore. - Hey. You have no idea what that little girl has been through. That's right. Of course you two are close. It figures, with two girls from the wrong side of the track to get chummy doesn't it? Okay. Damn it! Seventies is just so played out. I'm sick of bell bottoms. Classic always works, renaissance. Oh, my God. A corset with these babies. You might as well skip the Sadie Hawkins Dance and come straight to my after-party. It's gonna be savage. Uh, yeah. Yeah, okay, we're in. Dress shopping this weekend, Missy? Wouldn't miss it. Guys, look. Excuse me. What's Duffy doing here? I need to see that photo from my engagement party. I wanna confirm that Duncan was wearing his belt the night he was killed. It wasn't found at the crime scene. Yeah, sure. There's your belt right there. Text this to me right now. Good work, coach. Hey, Duff. Hey, what's going on? Come on, Missy. I can't help you if I don't know what's going on. Missy, please let me in. "May you never appeal to heaven... "in prayers so hopeless and so agonized... "as in that hour left my lips. "For never may you... "like me... dread to be an instrument to what you wholly love." I am an instrument of evil. That's not true. Mac's father was horrible to him. And I wanted him dead. I wanted him dead so we could be together. And now he is. No. No. Missy, what happened to Duncan is truly evil but it wasn't you. These feelings... these desires to protect Mac... If love is not the one thing worth fighting for then what is? Highlanders! ♪ Fair is foul and foul is fair ♪ ♪ Troy is here you best beware ♪ Whoo! Missy! Hey! So, what do you think of the new routine? - Loved it. - Thank you. Coach Clyde wants to see you in his office. Oh, God. It's probably 'cause of my absences. It's probably because he's totally obsessed with you. Well, I better give the all-purpose show if I mean to get out of detention. - Wish me luck. - Good luck. Coach Clyde, you wanted to see me? Um, hello! I'm here. Duff. Great call on the belt, son. Damn cheerleader called it in. Found Duncan's belt tucked away in Clyde's office. No. No, this can't be right. It-- Now, just enjoy it, son. Your first homicide and you nail it. You're a superstar again. Sheriff, I'm telling you. I have known this man for eight years. That's a good man that you have in there and I'm not telling you, he did not do it. This ain't our guy. Duffy, you're gonna learn in time that people are not always how they appear on the surface. Now, first thing tomorrow I want you down at that high school. You go interview the other coaches any teachers he's close with, the players. Hell, anybody that might give us something on Clyde. This ain't our guy... but I'll find you the person that is. You know, I can't wait for this weekend. What are you doing? We had to give Duffy something. Clyde didn't do anything. I don't like it anymore than you but if it's between him or us I'd chose us, wouldn't you? Yeah. Then, what's the problem? You just seem awful comfortable about it. You set up a man for murder and still find time to go dress shopping. Ever since that night, you haven't looked at me the same. You're scared of me. No. Not of you... of us. I'm scared of what this is turning us into. I have seen things too, Mac. Things that only belong in nightmares. Why didn't you tell me? I thought I was losing my mind. I had to be strong. I would live a thousand nightmares to be with you. But I need you to be strong too 'cause I... I can't do it all on my own. Aah. Yippie-ki-yay, boys. Mac, heads up. Hey, Mac, will you teach me how to throw a spiral? Yeah. You, uh, be real gentle to start with. - Not too gently. - Yeah. You grip it kinda like that. Just... You grip right about... Yo, let's bounce. I wanna stop for a burger on the way home. Yeah, you guys go on ahead. Wait, Mac, are you leaving me? Uh, no. I'm just not feeling too hot. I'm gonna walk this off before I get home. You know how my dad is. Hey! It's, uh... Missy, right? Hey, are we both in drama with Mr. Perez? You know, I can tell what time it is in class without looking at the clock. Do you wanna know how? Well, you see, class faces west. When I starting getting glare off his bald spot that's how I know it's almost over. Yeah, his head's like the world's last sundial. Can you, um... Can you turn around now? I never thought my jokes were bad enough to make someone to make someone pretty as you cry. - What's wrong? - I'm all alone. So really, the biggest takeaway from this novel is that both love and evil are relative. We can't have one without the other. And where there is love, there will also be... That's quite enough, Mr. Wayleigh. I'm sorry, Missy, please continue. Ah, yeah. Uh... Like I said, love is evil. Wh... Uh... Where there is love, there will also be-- - Boring! - Hey! Would you like a trip to the principal's... Hey, Mac! Mac, get off of him! Stop! Mac, get off of him! Hey! Break it up! Stop it! Get off... What is wrong with you? Go to the principal's office right now. - Troy started it. - It doesn't matter. You can't just attack someone because you don't like what they said. If you had more control over your classroom-- - Missy! - It wouldn't have happened. Wait outside for me, please. Whatever. Let's go, Mac. Are you alright? Coach Clyde's been here eight years now. How well do you know him? The coaches keep to themselves. High school clerks go way beyond the students. Of course, Clyde respected me as the head of the drama department. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure he does. Well, he was, like, always so obsessed with us cheerleaders, you know. Mm-hmm. So, what was it like when you went to school here? I mean, you played ball too, right? Yeah. - That was a long time ago. - Oh. Can you wrap that up? Coach Clyde didn't do it. What makes you say that? You cops need motive, right? Coach Clyde was the complete opposite. He loved Coach Duncan. He frickin' worshipped the dude. If anybody needed a reason to kill Duncan it's his own kid. - You're talking about Mac. - Yeah. I mean, he wasn't exactly the kid Duncan always wanted and he reminded Mac of that almost every day. You should have seen Mac's neck the day after the king showed up dead. Looked like coach took a belt to it. A belt, huh? This is your best friend you're accusing. Best friend? You mean the golden boy and his bitch girlfriend? He does whatever she tells him to do. Taking instructions, following orders. He used to be a leader. He used to run this place. Now... I don't even recognize the dude when I see him. My best friend? Missed you in our session today. Yeah, I don't need counseling anymore. It doesn't exactly work that way. And after what happened-- Missy, you coming or what? I got to run. I'll make it next time. Missy... Hey, Mac. Mac, hold up a minute, will you, buddy? Look, if you're here to ask me about Clyde I don't know anything. No. I'm here to ask about you. I want to know how you're doing. I'm doing alright. I'm actually supposed to go meet Missy right now, so... How well do you even know this girl, huh? Clyde is going down for murder. You know that, right? And they're gonna give him the death penalty unless maybe you know something that can change that. You're the cop. You arrest him. I trust you. Mac. Let me see something. Do not touch me. I know you and Duncan fought the night that he died. You need to tell me what happened. You call beating the shit out of me "fighting" then yeah, we fought that night. Look, if you just tell me the truth we can work this out together. I can help you. I can't protect you if you don't-- Then again, he beat me the week before too so it's hard to know which night you mean. It's funny. I don't remember you asking about the truth after any one of these fights before he died. You know what he was. Who are you? My dad wanted me to be a man. He finally got it. This isn't just gonna go away. If you think you could go around playin' house after something like this happens you got another thing coming. I'm coming, for you and your girlfriend. You hear me? You come after my house... I burn yours to the ground. We found micro traces of blood on that belt. There's a genetic similarity to the victim. Probably a close relative. - Mac, open the door. - Gran. This is really important. Anything y'all need, I'm here for ya. Mac, open the door. Let them in. Tell me about the fight between you and your dad the night that he died. I told you everything at school. How did the fight start? What were you two fighting about? I couldn't take the pressure of football anymore. I told him I wanted to quit. Then what happened next? Look, I love my dad. I didn't want the whole town to think bad about him. You sit still. Look, just because that boy's blood was on a belt, that don't mean he killed his dad. And just because we found a belt in Clyde's office doesn't mean he killed him either. By finding blood on that belt at least gives us probable cause to question him, doesn't it? Are you telling me that that's the only night your dad ever put hands on you? He was a good dad. Mac, stop lying to me. You know there are plenty of people who can corroborate that your father was rough on you plenty of times. Well, they're cowards then. If someone thought my dad was hurting me they should have reported it earlier. I mean, it's pretty convenient that someone would say these things after he's dead, right? I see you put in your transfers for early graduation. Stanford, huh? You must be pretty damn smart. Just honest hard work and I'm an avid reader. You put down those transcripts the same day Duncan was murdered. That afternoon actually. The day that you decide to leave high school the only person keeping you two apart your secret boyfriend's dad just somehow turns up murdered? It's pretty convenient, don't you think? If I tell you something... will you promise not to tell Mac? - Absolutely. - And you leave him out of it? You have my word. Mac came to my house to say goodbye that night. He had bruises all over him. I've never been so mad in my whole life. So I decided right then. Mac needed my help. I couldn't leave him like that. So... I decided to stay. Mac cried in my arms the entire night. I never let him out of my sight. I know it's terrible to say... but I'm not sad about Duncan. I swore I'd never tell anyone. But Duncan had been hurting Mac for years. To be honest, I'm surprised you never knew, deputy. I mean, you were so close with their family. But I suppose it's for the best. Because if you had known about the domestic violence and did nothing... I guess that would make you an accessory after the fact, right? Can anyone prove Mac was there with you that night? Yes. That poor child seemed awfully hurt. I wouldn't normally let a boy spend the night. It's not proper. I... made him some of my banana nut bread... my specialty. I'll bake some for the station. - Excuse me. - I saw boxes of those old... stale donuts. It was awfully nice of Mac to let your grandma stay with the two of you in that two-story mansion. Yes. It is. He is very kind. I think that's why I love him so much. You have been pulling his strings all along, haven't you? Ever since the beginning. I would never make Mac do anything he didn't want to. Every word that comes out of your mouth is a lie. How do you live with yourself just lying with every word that comes out of your mouth. Big-ass crocodile tears. I see through you-- That's about enough, deputy. You and your family, you're, you're free to go on. - Wait, I have one more ques-- - No, deputy. You have no other questions. Mac, your, uh, dad was greatly admired in this community. It's a loss for everyone. I'm sorry. Your blood was found on Duncan's belt that was taken from the crime scene. How do you explain that, huh? Stop it! Stop! You were at the dealership that night, I know you were. And you killed him. And if you didn't, she did. I want the truth from you, huh? - Okay. Okay. Okay. - You're right. You're right. - You're right. You're right. - Baby, let's go. No, no, he's right. It is my blood on that belt. Because it's the same belt he used to whip me with every week after I lost a game. You know. Mac, you don't have to say this. My dad deserved better than me... but I didn't kill him. Okay, come on. You guys are free to go. I understand, Mac. Sorry, again, about all the trouble. You're just doing your job, sheriff. - No. - My God, Duffy. Your head is more screwed up than I thought it was. Sheriff, they're lying. Every single last one. - Even the grandma-- - I don't wanna hear it. Two weeks paid leave starting right now. Go home, spend some time with that fiance and get your damn head straight. Sheriff, my head is fine, I... Would you just go home and try and preserve what little dignity you've got left. Boys, get him to his car and get him home. Baby, you were great in there today. I'm sorry, I thought I washed all the blood off the belt. You kidding? Made it even better. See the look on that sheriff's face? No, we were perfect. No. We underestimated him. Yeah, but after today, his word don't mean shit. He's not a quitter. You know that. It's him... or us. So, what do we do? He won't let us leave, we change his mind for him. Yeah. We send a message. I'm on my way. I am so sorry, Duff. She, uh, she must've been upstairs when the fire started. Hell, it's lucky we got her out at all. They're thinkin' it may have been a electrical fire that started probably in the kitchen or... Well... you give me a call if you need anything at all, you hear me? We did what we had to do. For us. I tried to warn you. I've become an instrument of evil to what I love. And I should feel terrible for what I've done. But I don't. I can't. I accept who I am... and what I had to do. For us.
