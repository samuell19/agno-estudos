Perhaps no one would believe us At border we soldiers always sleeps with one eye open. Don't we have to keep an eye on the move of enemies? After a while we close the other eye giving rest to the one eye kept open. Is that even possible to sleep with one eye open? 'Nothing is impossible fora winning mind' we're trained well in all tactics. So soldiers are really great deal? Dear Usman, you don't know a thing about soldiers. Haven't you heard 'stand guard with oil dripped in your eyes?' it is no nonsense. When a likewise situation comes up, we do pour oil in our eyes, mustard oil. Oh' that's why mustard oil is costlier, all soldiers use it up to keep them awake. Gandhiji and Nehru brought freedom butwho maintains them? When lwas in 37th battalion, lieutenant colonel Rudrappa was really shaken up' One of our frontiers is captured by Chinese militants. The only bridge left was bombed. Oh my God! We have to cross the border to recapture but heavy rain and flood thrashing. No one would believe, for my luck I got a magnet and a rope. Strapping the rope to the magnet I threw them off... Lieutenant colonel Rudrappa was startled] shocked. Fastening one end of the rope to a column, I got ready to go across. Even after colonel Rudrappa and soldiers tried to stop me, I didn't budge. Accepting it, I hang heavily...on the rope. Those days l was not like this, but a tall heavy young man of flame and energy. What about the magnet you threw, where did you found it?' No...l wasjust asking. Believe it or not, when borders are free off war, us and the Pak soldiers buddy up. We exchange their Rawalpindi arrack with our Kargil liquor. Festivals like Onam, Eid, and Christmas are well celebrated together with feast. Feast prepared by Shekhar kutty is in high demand for both INDIANS AND Pakistanis. When Pakistanis call 'hey brother...' it is such a comfort... but my most famous preparation is 'stirfried pumpkin leaf'. Pakistanis is in so much love with my 'stirfried pumpkin dish that they don't turn their head for another dish. Then how about we arrange a feast with the STIR FRIED PUMPKIN LEAF as the main dish? Sridhar? Don't you dare interrupt my conversation... I'll cut short what I have to say... During one of my feast Pakistanis were little late mean while Indians finished my 'Stir fried pumpkin' Pakistanis who arrived impatiently craving for my dish got disappointed. In frustration they got into fistic quarrel with the Indians.... Hah...and that's how Kargil War started in first place. I heard few other reasons for the cause of Kargil war You may hear different reasons butthis is the Truth...so you better hear what I say. Got it?' Stop! If we got caught with him all our programs will derail...so better escape. Over there...fast...run... Hey...hey...oracle... Do we have our drummer behind us?

What are you saying? Look at all this...people left them at the mere sight of you. Will you be able to pay forthem...will you? Do I have Nipah virus to scare them off? You are more deadly than Nipah. Don't even think of meeting Qatar Saidali, he'll finish you off. Really? You're the only reason his house warming got pushed to a week later. Me...? How am I related to his house construction? Want to know the relation? Poor workers weretrapped in his bull shooting and got stuck with their work. Hah...that is the reason...! Can't you stop with your bragging? I don't think age is a matterfor speaking the truth. What is this new item? Cake prompted another memory of an event. No one would believe but it was 100ft in length. Even after the whole party devouring the cake only a portion of, Finally Dingambaran Singh loaded the cake on hisjeep to take it overto his home.

This road cannot take much. Still I'm going in 50 mph. What 50 mph is a speed? In gulfwe start our carat 50mph. Watching our speed the Arabs ask 'hassa saiyarra wa salooki?' Says... 'What the heck?

Then? Then he will narrate the whole film storyto us. Whaaat? How can someone enjoy movie after they knew the whole story? It is his money thrown all overfor movie and the food, there is nothing to lose from it. But once we group of friends decided to crash his usual routine. We watched the movie before he could get a chance that tore him deep. Another day he came forward with a new story. Hey...hey...look where you going man... He said how much of a fan he is of Jayan and Jayan made his driverto take a photo of them together Aftertaking his address and wrapping him to a hug...he left. More thrilling than Jayan's movie.

Yeah...he clued me in Where is Shekharan Kutty? Until we reach here, he was gossiping about uncle's blow smoke theories. Any way please introduce your uncle, I really want to know him.

Owner of this house is moving on with an idea of selling it. So lwas thinking to buy it. That can be done easily. House owner Bhaskar is my friend. Maybe I can put a word for you. One son, he owns a travel agency in Sikkim. Last month we visited. Beautiful place... but the cold weather, uff...it is -4, freezing. -4 are cold? When I was in service, I stayed in Kashmir, Siachal and the temperature was -20. Cold means...intense chill but we got a technic. When the freezing temperature inside and outside our body matches, it won't affect us. I was there... Mentioning the word Kargil war, I can feel the blood pumping hard through my veins. Lansnayak Azhakappan from Tamil Nadu was my best buddy. I stormed towards Major Zacharia's room and urged for permission to fight against. I started towards the border. 'VANDE MATARAM' 'VANDE MATARAM' 'VANDE MATARAM.I During that operation I killed about 20 pak soldiers. There are more than 100 army real life stories left unsaid. That's even better, in bedroom you can listen to my stories lying down. You're wolfing down the food, were you starving in your hostel? Keep it here... I don't know if my brother had dinner. When you guys are not here, he stays. Stop talking nonsense. There is some definite muddle between them. His heart is still owned by Anjali, another reason he never remarried. That sordid dweller is coming. he drained my whole blood last time, still not satisfied. Don't open the door until I say so. It's me...Shekharan Kutty. Since its Sunday we can have a lot of time to chat. Koshy Sir...Ko-oshy sir...Koshy sir... Good morning! Good morning...good morning... Where you rushing off to on a Sunday.

They are 11 in total againstjust me, alone. if he drop dead with your hit, people will That's not the end...your life will be behind the bars. Life sentence. When they got the wind that I surrendered without wasting a single bullet, got excited. With turn of events, Iunging fonNard I scoot over, snatching the AK 47 from one of them. What happened to your house? Such a calm and peaceful place. No...not the same area not even in same district. Braggart terror? The boy have good height, weight, hair and really good moustache' No...| was just checking for something that he doesn't have. Lemme see Nothing will change. No! Lasttime when a boy settled in gulf wentto meet the girl's family, The girl asked that's what is called dowry. It was you...? As both families like each other, why don't we speed up the rest of the formalities? Who is he? So slight changes are asked to meet with us. No trouble at all. Come inside. Please take seats Please sit down... This is the boy's father 'Ramendran', this is his wife Radha. He is girl's uncle Shekharan. I'm from gulf, great... Great? What is that? It took me over a month to learn the method from them Once when our Lieutenant Colonel Rudrappa had the same problem, he coiled down with pain A small block of wood is kept in align with the spinal cord. After placing it overthe spinal cord, take a huge hammer and strike for four times. At the fourth strike back pain will be cured thoroughly. No...why? After hearing it my half pain is eased. Uncle...? Ha? Uncle...we're not here for a carpenter's job. Refreshments are set out. Even though he is in America, he doesn't have anysort oftroubled behavior like today's youngsters He is crazy? Yes... He can't be hold responsible for that because I too was a daring one, he got the same blood. Indian President specially honored me. we won't allow you to go before you show us some of your acts. We have a bike here. Actually it's been a long time since I rode the bike. Uncle? Do you really need to do this? You should shoot it clearly. Let me first ride this thing, we can call them later. That's the main problems for new model bikes. No...not the helmet, face cannot be seen if you keep that... Okay then start off systematically. Run...escape... We wrecked one of the fine alliance brought to us through blessing. He would have been in jail for mass murder ifthe situation changed a little sideways. Then I thought to stand up for our family's pride. By reason of your turbulent actions...my daughter's life is spoiled. Mom...listen to what you speaks, how can uncle be the reason for anything? Mom you were a lot today. This is nothing! In army Punjabis used to stand in queue to taste my chicken curry. It's Kashmir...Kashmir. Oh...i...Kashmir and Punjab are close places, a stop difference don't make much differences. Uncle! Can I ask you a question? We can talk about other first and then this, Kashmiri chicken is best. How did you meet her? Please tell us about your epic love story. I first met her at my teacher's home' Actually her husband colonel Ragavan Nam biyar helped me join in the Army. Anjali is her granddaughter. later it turn out to be a little fondness, gratitude... Kargil war started at the most unexpected time, When I was back from the war Anjali and Teacher were gone some place far. Then how did you marry her? Shekharan Kutty... 87... Why the heck are you here? To marry you off No much liability, average education! That was your demand, right? Singular? The prefer register marriage without much fancy fuss and want to live in Bangalore after. Possibly she doesn't want to resign herjob after all. I think I have a better idea, I'll ask them to take on your sister and her children too. I have brought countless proposals, every single one you rejected with silly reasoning. Oh my...my...hand... But I did what you want. If teacher was here, she'll be the happiest person for our marriage. Think about it...if that bullet has fallen offthe cliff with you. What you mean? I mean you're talking some clueless things... You're clearly mistaken. Why are you laughing? I don't know. I was emotionally drained. Not asingle clue? Nope. He was narrating the story of two hit cinema. In the film when the train screeches pacing forward, ....He himself as Spiderman. Exactly! In the film Suresh Gopi tried all his tricks, still Shobhana have no clue of who he is? Aye...nope... He is still crazy about movies. Tsk...Tsk... Not tsk. He is your little uncle, only thing keeping me off from bursting. I couldn't get a wink of sleep thinking about uncle. Why? You want to join there? We can hear her side of story. Listen...that is the truth. Excuse me Can you ask yourAunt to recommend mefor some job here, I'm okay even with a janitorjob Go straight and turn left. To the left? Despite your spelling errors your English sound tip-top. Come on...don't play games. That is some peaches' My friends pushed my alliance with Shekharan Kutty. A simple yet a bashful person. Less talks and more silence. Like he was in an excitement phase. After marriage his attitude changed entirely. A behavior no one could stomach, bogus stories... You know? I have never been to Kerala. Each passing day made things more complicated. Meet Dr. Vimal, he is a psychiatrist. What will you have? Anjali and I are close friends, she hinted about the few troubles. No...Shekharan Kutty. Mr. Vimal. Our marriage life is our private matter. Trying to scare me off with English? Pack him as soon as possible or I'll... Idenied... You can stop rolling eyes at me. I can't keep my mouth shut anymore. Make sure everyone get a good work out. Hello...Shekharan Kutty, we're leaving. What is this? Tea and snack? Ghee rice and chicken curry will be ready for lunch. The only best thing turn out from the welfare meeting sponsored by him in every month is the ghee rice and chicken fry. That is a curt opinion. It is only because of him we're able to keep in touch. One rank, one pension should be in complete order. What good can it bring? Silent against whatever rudeness they spit. I had to think about my family A single blow is enough, they would never walk straight. I'll remind you one thing until our needs are met we'll keep fighting. During Chinese war... Stop right there... Chinese war... Reach an agreement without filing a case. I'm the only head here, if you want to make a settlement without a case, bring money. A boy is been waiting for a long time to meet you. Sir... Sir, my name Murughan, my house is nearthe village office. Your father? It is just me and my sister now. the documents and terrorizing us to vacate the house. Kuppu swamy' Use that money to get out of this place. Looks like you filed police complaint against me. Ten days...you should clearthe house, if not... What is this? Gas is very costlier now a days! Selling expired soda? Brother... Shekharan kutty house? Ahh.. You're not allowed to change it... Change? Tell me what's going on? They're from Tamil Nadu to meet our Vaunt Shekharan Kutty. I conversed with my little knowledge in Tamil and found their mother is dead and they are here for their father. In Kerala if somebody needs help in finding an address, the whole town will help them. Such a beautiful place. Oh god, the whole village approaching. What's going on? Those children are here for their father, Shekharan kutty! Don't create a scene, people will talk. I think you don't leave any one...look at those people. That is a lot of people. Please...stop talking. Let me call him. I had tried many times, it seems to be that he took a hint and escaped. Don't stress, it's just an auto.... He is still unconscious. We should find a solution for the Tamil Children. Or else what? M.G.R will slash my neck? You sit here and you over there. Sure. Butwhere is it? I'm not sure. Look around in his home. Give the phone to mom. Your 'brother Jayan.‘ I think he hid the letter for that reason. The whole town thinks you cooked up the Jayan story, even Ithought you were blowing smoke. hang it at the entrance of 'Panchayath office building.' but now it's different, people will accuse that you used computerto edit the photo, Also every single person knows Jayan. Don't draw unwanted fuss. Leave it at the same place it is found. How are you feeling now? If you didn't save her from that dreadful place, she won't be having a good life. Still at the thought of it my body quakes a fear. Welcome sir. We got beautiful girls from Kerala, one night-Rs 2000 only. Food and drinks free. I'll be back in a minute, take yourtime to choose. We're from different places. We didn't allow them to use us. Please...help us. Where are you guys? Come...quick.

Swirling the stick against the flying grenades I applied the stick technic. I strike the pacing grenades with the rotating stick. Finally we both made it out ofthe Changlang forest without a single scratch. Teacher looks like she doesn't believe me. I lived with an Army man for fifty years.
