X minus 18 minutes. Blood pressure slightly high. Nothing to be alarmed about though. Quite understandable under the circumstance. The weaker sex, the only one whose blood pressure is normal. X minus 17 minutes. You're in the assembly hall in another minute, shall we go? - Good luck. - Thank you, doctor, and goodnight. X minus 16 minutes. Ladies and gentlemen... Every news service and newspaper is represented here tonight. And for your co-operation in the past, when complete secrecy was vital... We are grateful. However, I must make something clear. Although ours is not strictly a military project... A great deal of our research and knowledge... falls within security regulations. Therefore, I must insist... that you reveal only such information as appears in the authorized press release. Which will be handed to you later. I'm sure that we can all recall the wild tales of the flying discs, flying saucers, spaceships. and who knows what imaginative creations. The Press is to commended for discounting, in most instances, these premature rumors. That, so helping to minimize public apprehension. Tonight, you are invited here to witness an important event. You are all familiar with our previous work in sending robot missiles into space. That phase is at an end. Tonight, we will launch the first manned space ship! The R-X-M. Rocketship eXpedition Moon. X minus 15 minutes. Forever, man has dreamed of visiting the nearest of heavenly bodies. Some, for adventurous, fantastic reasons. Others, like ourselves, because they... visualized a successful lunar expedition... as the first step towards practical interplanetary travel. Today, there is even the possibility... that an unassailable base could be established on the Moon... to control world peace. I will now introduce to you the head of this expedition and his crew. Dr. Carl Eckstrom. Designer of the R-X-M. And as you all know, one of the most brilliant physicists of the day. And an old friend. Dr. Lisa Van Horn. His most able co-worker and assistant. Doctor of chemistry. Col. Floyd Graham. Pilot. Mr. Harry Chamberlain. Astronomer... of the Mount Wilson and Palomar observatory staffs. Mr. Chamberlain will serve as navigator. Maj. William Corrigan. Engineer. I shall now ask Dr. Eckstrom to outline the flight plan for you. Carl... X minus 14 minutes. The distance between the Earth and the Moon, at its closest proximity, is 238,000 miles. We expect to cover this distance in approximately 48 hours. The first phase of our flight will be the ascent. To an altitude of 300 miles. From the start, while we pass through the troposphere and stratosphere, until we reach the ionosphere, the flight will controlled by our automatic pilot. After we have climbed through the atmosphere, we will turn the rocket into a parallel course with the surface of the Earth. In flying parallel with the Earth's surface.. we receive added boost from its rotation. X minus 13 minutes. The R-X-M is what is known as a multi-stage or step-rocket. Upon reaching escape velocity, the tail section, which has housed the fuel to attain this speed, will be jettisoned. The nose section, which is a complete rocket, containing enough fuel for the entire trip and also containing our cabin, overcomes the gravitational pull of the Earth and heads in the direction of the moon. After we have passed the equilibrium point, were the Earth and the Moon's gravities are in balance... we will reduce power to a minimum. The Moon's attraction will carry us the rest of the way. Finally, we will reverse the rocket... utilizing the thrust of its motors to make our landing. A few more details which might interest you... The cabin is pressurized and gyro controlled, keeping us in a level position at all times. We carry radar for navigation, shortwave for communication. And most important, more than twice the amount of fuel we expect to use, to keep well within the margin of safety. X minus 12 minutes. We still have a few moments, ladies and gentlemen, for questions, if any of you care to... Chamberlain! How do you fit into the picture? - Do you have any family? - No, I've been living on mountain tops. I'm afraid it's too lonely for such opportunities. - Have you ever done any flying? - Only as a passenger. But, you're the navigator. You must realize, that inter-solar flight requires far more exact and precise navigation than any Earth-bound voyage, of course that's incidental. - It is? - Yes. You see, as an astronomer, I can appreciate the perfect observation conditions on a body without atmosphere, such as our Moon. - Do you realize... [fades out] ...got about 800 head grazing down there. I bought my ranch with the flight pay I saved up during the war. How does your wife feel about you going? Well... she's a Texan too, and... Well, she knows that when a Texas man make up his mind to do something. That it, period! I wish you fellas coulda seen her face when I walked in and told her. In the strictest confidence, of course. Honey, I'm going to the Moon. And what did she say? She looked at me for a second, and then said... What for? They ain't got nothing there that we don't have more of right here in Texas! We've already made the trip a hundred times. - What? In the training room. I've done more flying this last month than I've done in over a 100 missions. Believe me, this is the hottest crew I've ever worked with. Especially in the brains department. Yeah, very attractive too. Yeah, I agree, but you can quote me on this... Unless you look like a test tube or a chemical formula you haven't got a chance. So, from the woman's angle Dr. Van Horn, how does it feel making a trip like this alone with 4 men? To tell you the truth, I... I never thought much about it. Tell me Doctor, is there any specific reason why one member of the crew should be a woman? I'd like to answer that if I may. The reason Ms. Van Horn is making this trip is because of her pioneering research with monotonic hydrogen. It enabled her to develop the first rocket fuel powerful and concentrated enough to make this flight possible. X minus 11 minutes. Ladies and gentlemen, we are pressed for time! You may view the take-off from the observation bunker, and return to this room immediately afterward. Everybody return here, after the take-off! X minus 7 minutes. Gyro's controlling compass OK. Batteries all up, auto pilot OK. Everything's in order. I've checked the calculations many times. They're perfectly correct. Oh, yes, all commercial flights have been detoured 100 miles south. Thank you. Well, I can't think of anything we've overlooked. All we need now is a little luck. Doesn't seem real, the moment finally has arrived after all these years, It has been a long time. A long time for two men to work together. You remember when we started, what they called us? - Young crackpots. - Yes, and what are we now? Maybe, just... crackpots. The only regret I have is that I must stay behind. Your job is no less important, Ralph. I know, but still... X minus 6 minutes. Karl... Good luck. Good luck, everybody. X minus 5 minutes. Better take one more look. You won't be as close as this to Mother Earth for some time. I'll give the motors a final once over. X minus 4 minutes. Motor room sealed. Everything in order! X minus 3 minutes. No change of flight plan, as discussed. First 7 minutes of flight, controlled by automatic pilot. Pilot's ready! Seven minutes, straight ascent. Straight ascent from starting point. Starting thrust using all 10 assembly engines. - 2300 ton. - Right! Fuel mixture? Hydrogen and oxygen, plus A12 After 120 seconds, hydrogen and oxygen, plus A14. After 340 seconds, hydrogen plus A16. - After 560 seconds, A16. - Right. Any questions? X minus 2 minutes. Good luck. X minus 1 minute. X minus 50 seconds. X minus 40 seconds. X minus 30 seconds. X minus 20 seconds. X minus 10 seconds. X minus 5 seconds. Zero! Now, if you will follow me we will attempt to establish radio contact with the ship. The human body can withstand these accelerations. But, it certainly was never meant to. I feel like I was just tossed off a spooky bronc. Are you alright, doctor? Oh, yes, you can't hurt an old campaigner like me. - How about you, you alright? - Certainly. Radar and gyro compass in order. Automatic pilot OK. - Fuel consumption? - Normal! - Air pressure? - 15 pounds. Harry? It's a marvelous sight, isn't it? It is. You study maps, globes, and try to visualize... But the actual experience... It's hard to express it. Stand by to turn! Stand by. Turn. 90 degree turn completed. We should have a flight speed... 3400 mile per hour. Altitude, 360 miles. How do we stand on fuel now? ?? left in tail section. - Mixture at thrust? - A16. - Harry, contact the base. - Right. R-X-M. calling B-W-S. R-X-M calling B-W-S. Over. Come in R-X-M. Over to you. Stand by, B-W-S. Eckstrom speaking. We have leveled off at 360 miles altitude. And are circling the globe at 3400 miles per hour. We will increase speed gradually until we reach escape velocity of 25,000 miles per hour Everyone aboard ship well. Over to you. We'll be standing by. - 5500 miles. - Continue acceleration. Hey, what happened to the rest of the night? I'm afraid we ran right out of it. If it's darkness you want, wait until we enter outer space. The realm of perpetual night. 6,000... 6,200 miles per hour. Radar is tracking them perfectly! I had contact with them 4 minutes ago. Altitude, 1600 miles. Speed, 21,000 miles per hour. Constantly increasing. They are about to reach escape velocity. 22,000. Bill... check the pressurizing system and oxygen. -Right. Boy, this kind of weather makes me feel right at home. It's like a nice cool night in East Texas. 24,000. Take a reading the moment we attain escape velocity. - Yes, sir. Stand by! 25,000. Prepare to jettison tail section. Start the front assembly motors. Only 40 seconds supply of fuel left. Hold on tight, everybody. - You ready?! - Ready. Go! Reduce power. Look out! That was a little too close for comfort. We might be in a vacuum, but I sure felt the wind of that one. Harry, contact the base again. R-X-M calling B-W-S, over. Come in R-X-M, over to you. Stand by, B-W-S. We are on our way! We have jettisoned tail section. And are now reducing power and speed according to plan. Until we come within the attraction of the Moon. This probably last radio contact before return flight. Everybody aboard well. B-W-S calling R-X-M. B-W-S calling R-X-M. Come in, R-X-M. Ladies and gentlemen... We had hoped by having the entire Press represented here tonight... To eliminate any possible hearsay rumor or speculation within your reports. However, I regret to have to ask you to confine yourselves to the official news release. I promise to hand you any news that may come in, as soon as it can be cleared. I don't think I like all this dark. It might be alright for sleeping. For a steady diet, uh-uh! I used to hate the daylight, because I couldn't work. But up here in this eternal night... It's a different feeling. A fella can get used to anything I guess, if he has to. Now, I remember when I was first assigned to jets. I said to the colonel, "Colonel..." "I joined this man's air force to fly an airplane." "But nobody's gonna hitch me to no Roman candle!" And now I'm sitting right inside of one. Boy, oh, boy. Ain't she pretty? Can you see Texas? No, it's in the other hemisphere. Even so, from this distance it would only appear a mere speck. A mere speck! Texas, a mere speck?! Listen my friend, I'm broad minded, I've been around people, but... Don't you ever let any other Texan hear you say that. A mere speck! It's the funniest sensation. I feel like I'm walking on a cloud, no effort at all. We're getting deeper into interplanetary space, gravity will soon be practically non-existent. Look, we got a stowaway aboard! Hey, whoa! I need you. Don't you think it's amusing? Nothing funny about that, simply the lack of gravity. Oh, of course, Dr. Van Horn. Better make sure our equipment's fastened down. Now don't get mad at me, but can't you ever relax? All these weeks, months... I've been watching you. Nothing but work, work, work. Well, I've been wondering... How does a girl like you get mixed up in a thing like this in the first place. I suppose you think that women should only cook and sew and bare children? Isn't that enough? There's such a thing as going overboard in the other direction too, you know. If you know what's... I'll check the engines! Bill, pressurize the motor room first. Motor room pressure up. We're still drifting. After 14 hours and 12 minutes... We've covered 112,000 miles. We'll come within the gravitational attraction of the Moon... That's not important right now, without power we're helplessly suspended in space. Even if we were already within the gravitational reach, we'd still be unable to make a landing. We need power to land! I checked and double checked all connections. Drivers... Fuel injectors... Can't find a thing wrong. Then it must be the fuel mixture. How much oxygen do we carry? Don't worry, we have plenty left for the trip. For the trip as planned, you mean? If you don't mind... The differential 6 over M to the 30th power, the halfway check result is 262,341, both using tangent 8, correct? That isn't the result I have. They must be the same. There's an error there. I've made no error, Dr. Eckstrom. I have to say that you made an error, and discard your figures. I'm sorry! Don't be... Surely you're not going to let emotion enter into this? Certainly not. We'll continue computing, using my results as a basis. Yes, Doctor. Except that I feel very strongly I should say that we should try both. We can't... To complete either calculation will take 6 to 8 hours. We can't afford the time. It's either one or the other, Dr. Van Horn. but it doesn't have to be... You can't be arbitrary about imposing your will, when these people's lives are at stake. Don't you realize that? You speak as calmly as if you were saying pass the salt. Aren't you human? Are you made of ice? I'm sorry. I apologize. For what? For momentarily being a woman? It's completely understandable, Ms. Van Horn. - Now, shall we go ahead? - Yes, Doctor. - Tangent L9. - Tangent L9. Hello? Yes. It's Dr. Hurley at Mt. Palomar. Yes, Dr. Hurley... yes. We located the R-X-M's position at 7:16 this morning. Since then there has been very little change. Apparently, their velocity... Is far more than we anticipated. Are you sure, Doctor? Thank you. "The wind that blows between the worlds." "It cut him like a knife." What? Hah, nothing, it's a line from Kipling's Tomlinson. A poem about the chap, ah, somewhat in our fix. He couldn't get in to heaven or hell. Suspended in space. Would you do something for me, please? Sure. I need those two graphs under Dr. Eckstrom's arm. I'm tired and shaky, I might awaken him, I know the feeling. I wouldn't rob him of his sleep for anything. I knocked over a 10 foot Christmas tree once, while decorating my cousin's house, just still trying to do something when I was too tired. It was about one o'clock in the morning, kid's woke up, came rushing in. At first the thought I was Santa Claus, lying there with a busted tinsel star on my nose. - I spoiled everything! - Shh... - Thanks. - It's no trouble. Why don't you take a minute off from that? - You're worn out. - I can't. You'll think clearer if you do. When I was flying in the war, we had a guy like you on some of our long missions. Too bad. Too bad? He blew his top. We had to put him in section 8. He held it in too long, never let down a second. You're right, I'm not even thinking straight anymore. Numbers buzz in my head like wasps. I ought to think of something different. How 'bout that? Something no human being ever saw before. You know, it's funny... one never thinks of the Earth that way. As a dying planet with nothing to give out but reflected light. A mere moon. Don't speak so disrespectfully of the Moon. I've done some of my best work by moonlight. I've found its light very effective. For navigation? For any purpose. Don't underrate it. Moonlight's potent. You're speaking of, ah, it's effect on men and women? On women, I don't need the stuff myself. - You are immune? - No. Just don't need it. But, did you ever park in an open convertible on the cliff's overlooking the Pacific, on a warm summer night when a big moon hung up there like a lantern? Blue light from it walking across the water... Radio playing a nice tune. Waves swishing on the beach. No, I uh... Perhaps unfortunately... I never had the time, nor the thought, to do anything much beyond my profession. Now don't tell me that you never looked at that old moon except for astronomical reasons? You're right. I have.. In Rome once... In Switzerland... I begged ?? What a nice stroll. Stroll? Yes. Yes, we walked slowly around the edge of the lake for 2 hours. And never stopped? No. Well... Everybody has their own taste. It was lovely there. Water black like cold coffee. The moonlight, like flecks of ice cream floating on it. The music from the hotel bar room. Oh, but that was so long ago... Another world. - Fine scientist I am... - Why? Daydreaming. It's good for you once in a while. I suppose it is, but... Not now. I still say it... Say what? That moonlight's effective stuff. You're quite right. What effect a double dose like this would have in a convertible. - Hmm? - Nothing. Skip it. Meteorites! Boy... I've been through some pretty heavy flak in my day, but... that's the worst I've ever had thrown at me. Heavenly flak. Say... Maybe somebody don't want us to get where we aim to get? Oh, cheer up, Harry! After what we've been through, we'll get there alright. Maybe it'd been better if one had struck the ship. At least it'd been sudden... Quick. Now, your computation? We have to add 12% O3 to A16. Right, 12% O3 to A16. This means we'll have to rearrange some of the fuel tanks and all the connections. We'll replace these H tanks, with these. The motor room's pressurized. Do you think you can manage a half ton tank? Oh, sure. Down on my ranch... I used to throw a little ol' 1000 pound steer over my shoulder every morning. You sure that wasn't a little ol' bull you were throwing? Alright, Samson, let's see you do your stuff. Think I was kidding, huh? You'll never prove it to me here. Doctor? Can we be quite sure these proportions are safe? We never proved them by experiment. The mathematical theory is beyond question. O3 though, sometimes it behaves unpredictably. Woman's intuition again? 12% O3 to A16. 12% O3 to A16. And chart deviation is 32 degrees. Present position... We'll correct course when we're in powered flight once more. - All ready? - Ready. Stand by, everybody. Will you repeat that again, Dr. Hurley? Are you certain? Yes... Yes, I see. Thank you. They are completely off their course. And moving with incredible velocity. Out into limitless space. I can't understand it. Floyd? Floyd? Floyd? You alright? Yeah. Yeah, I'm alright. Harry! Harry! Harry. We're not getting enough oxygen. No. Bill?!... Bill?! Dr. Eckstrom. Dr. Eckstrom, Dr. Eckstrom, Dr. Eckstrom! How long has it been since we...? I'm afraid we'll never know. How are the others? I think everybody's going to be alright. It must have been days. Fortunately the engines were turned off. When?! I must have turned the levers off when I blacked out. But at what speed? You know the consequences of a body moving with unchecked velocity in free space. Infinite motion! So we made a little detour. Now we gotta double back to that last road sign Come on, let's go to work. Try to determine our present velocity if possible. It can't be true. The instruments must have gone crazy! I don't think so. By heading into space we've added the Earth's orbital velocity to our own. We're really moving! I should say at least several times the maximum speed of your indicator. Any progress, Harry? Should at least have an approximation of our position very shortly. Fuel consumption? In just a moment. - Doctor? - What? I cut in resistances to raise the scale. And look! Acceleration, Definite acceleration, but... With the motors off, that's impossible, unless... - This can't be correct. - What? I seem to be getting a strong refection of impulse, directly ahead, 50,000 miles. - That explains it. - Explains what? Of course. Unbelievable. It couldn't be mere chance? I don't know quite how to tell you it, so... If I could've even dreamed that... That an incredible set of circumstances, each precisely and exactly timed... would carry us unerringly though space to our most congenial planetary neighbor, Mars... - I wouldn't have... - Mars! It's utterly unbelievable! No doubt whatsoever, unmistakable! Mars, what do you know? What does it mean, Doctor? It means there are times when a mere scientist has gone as far as he can. We must pause, and observe respectfully, while something infinitely greater assumes control. I believe this is one of those times. We shall go on, of course. Our overall fuel consumption was... 42 percent! A martian landing, approaching a planet with atmosphere, is far easier than a lunar maneuver. Certainly we shall go on. We should be betraying an unprecedented opportunity to do otherwise. Then I'd suggest there's a couple of little things we might do. This ship isn't going to land itself, you know. Mars... Well, I'll be darned. We must first compute the correct thrust and fuel mixture to comply with anticipated conditions. Escape velocity 12,500 miles an hour. Oxygen at surface level 15%. Prepare to change the parallel course at distance 1500 miles. - Right. I've located it! - Located what? - The Earth and Moon! - Well, where are they? - Here, take a look. Well, what do you know about that? Is it alright to call Texas a mere speck now? As we are parallel flight, we are reducing speed and altitude. At 50 miles altitude, we will execute a turn of 90 degrees. Bringing the rocket into landing position. Since the gravitational attraction of Mars is only half as powerful of that of Earth... A thrust of 1200 tons will be sufficient to make the landing. - Fuel? - Hydrogen and oxygen plus A12. Altitude 70 Miles. 65... 60... 55 miles! Stand by to turn. 50! Turn. 90 degree turn completed! Reduce power. Altitude 40 miles. - 38 miles. - I only hope the light holds out. It's getting dark down below. Prepare to increase thrust at altitude 15 miles. It's getting darker rapidly. As far as I can make out, the terrain is suitable for landing. Altitude 6 miles. 5 miles... 20,000 feet. - 18,000. - Thrust and pressure 1250 tons. Stand by to increase power. 15,000... 12,000... 10,000... 8,000, 7,000, 6,000. We're losing altitude too fast! Increase thrust to 3,000 tons. 4,000 feet. 3,000... 2,000 feet. Reduce thrust slowly to 1250 tons. 1,000... 500... Save the engines. Nice work, Floyd! Mars, extending us a welcome! Ah, we'll prepare to disembark first thing in the morning. In the meantime we can rest and get our equipment ready. Well, that's what I've been waiting for. Yeah, I've been itching to get into one of these things. Sorry to disappoint you, Bill. We have atmosphere here, we won't need pressure suits. Which works greatly in our favor too. We can accomplish so much more unencumbered. Now, as far as equipment's concerned, we'll take oxygen masks - Camera, paraphernalia... - What about data for the return trip? It must be exact and precise, hadn't we better begin preparations? Yes, of course, you're right. We have so little time here, such and opportunity. Let's think about that for a little while, first. Look at the rock formations ahead. Notice the abundant coloration? Green, orange, yellow, black? A sign of tremendous mineralization. Manganese, copper, nickel, pitchblende... Immense deposits of pitchblende! You figure on staking out a claim here? I'm just making sure we can find our way back. All we've seen so far is rock and sand, sand and rocks. I wonder when we're gonna run across some of these martians? You know, from what I read, they... they've got pale faces, and pin heads, and fishy eyes! Shall we go? Beautiful. The mind that conceived this must have been of a high order of intelligence. At least the equal of Earths. Perhaps considerably above ours. To think that a complex, organized society existed here once. Yes, from all indications, thousands of years ago. I wonder how it happened? There's always the possibility of a meteor. But then it would have created a depression, like a moon crater. No, this wasn't caused by a meteor... This is definitely blast effect, coupled with intense heat. There's a strong field of radiation over there. You better stop, the radioactivity is at the danger level. Ironic, isn't it?... The mind of man... Wherever you encounter it, Earth, or Mars... The highest attainments of human intellect... Always diverted to self destruction. Perhaps the entire surface of the planet is one vast ruin, like this. Don't you think we ought to start back to the ship? I agree to that. We're neither prepared nor equipped for any stay here. We have supplies for several days. Let's use this precious time as effectively as we can. I agree with Dr. Eckstrom. A day here is more valuable than years of research on Earth. Well, OK then, let's get going. What a lesson here, for our world. One blast... Thousands of years of civilization... Wiped out. Could there have been any survivors? I should hate to think so. We still don't know all the genetic effects of radiation... But, that it will produce mutations, malformities, disfigurements, blindness, that much we're sure of from research A blast like this... I should hate to think that any survived. Why don't you try to get some rest? If I ever get back to Texas, I'll know better than to leave again, yes, sir. Bill, Floyd, Dr. Ackstrom! There were men out there! Look, you gotta believe me! It wasn't a nightmare, I haven't slept at all! - I tell you, I saw them! - Where? Right out there! And when I yelled, they disappeared! Alright, let's go see! Right here. And when they heard me, they disappeared in there. Dr. Eckstrom.... Look at these footprints. It don't take a Navajo to figure out what caused these. It's hard to believe. Now maybe you'll agree to return to the ship! We can't stop now, we must follow, find out what kind of creatures they are. It's tremendously important! We don't know how many there are... And suppose they're hostile, with one rifle and a pistol... - We won't have a prayer. - That's the chance we have to take. You wait here, I'm going ahead. This kind of thing is just my meat, mind if I come along? - Thank you, Bill. - I'm with you, Doctor. - No Floyd, you three stay. - Why not? - I'll have to make that an order! - Come on, Bill. Blind! Atomic age... To stone age. Bill! Dr. Ackstrom! Where's Bill! Murdering savages. No, Floyd... They're crazed, despairing, wretches... Pity them. - Pity them. - Don't talk anymore. You must get back to Earth! Tell them what we found! Maybe this will... Look out! I wish Harry were able to help... It's impossible to get a precise result without radar! You've done a wonderful job. We should have fuel enough for a landing. When will we feel the Earth's gravity? As soon as there's an increase in speed. According to elapsed time and velocity chart, almost any minute now. But, without a check from Harry... I know, we're in a tight spot, but we'll manage somehow. - Any sign of increase in speed? - Not yet. You know... You're a pretty swell girl, Lisa. A girl? I'm not Dr. Van Horn anymore? No. Just Lisa. Doing her job. No, I don't see you that way at all. I see a woman, sweet, gentle... And beautiful. I'm not the same? Somehow, no. But, I am, you know. The same, I mean. Well, maybe I've changed then, but... I feel that... I've never known you before. Can you ah... Do something for me, please? Sure. What? Say my name the way you did a moment ago? Lisa. R-X-M calling B-W-S. R-X-M calling B-W-S. Come in B-W-S. Over... Come in B-W-S. Can't contact them... They won't answer. - The won't ever answer! - Of course they will. Speeds increasing, were gonna make it, shut off the fuel! I feel sorry... I wish I could help. You heard what Floyd said. Everything will be alright. What about the fuel? We... - We lost so much. - Yes, but... We'll have enough for a landing. How we doing? Not so good. Now what's the matter? Everything's worked out so far, right on the nose. We haven't got enough fuel for a landing. Not even for an approach. The motors we functioning perfectly before I shut them off. And once hit capacity. ?? I'm sorry, it's all my fault! Maybe it's only the instruments! It's hopeless. We're lost. Everything is lost! All of Dr. Eckstrom's work in vain. Now the world will never know the terrible truth we learned. No... Maybe there's still a chance. We must be close enough for shortwave. We'll try to contact the base. If we only could. We must report everything. Tell them... as much as we can. What we saw.. The mistakes that we made. R-X-M calling B-W-S. R-X-M calling B-W-S. Dr. Fleming, radio control room just called, they've contacted the R-X-M! There's too much interference, you better use these, Doctor. B-W-S, Fleming speaking. Calling R-X-M. Come in, R-X-M! Repeat that again please, Dr. Van Horn. What about Dr. Eckstrom? Now, at least they know. Floyd, hold me, hold me tight! I wish I know some words that would help. I'm sorry that we haven't had any time, that we didn't meet and know each other the way we do now sooner. Time isn't so important. - Yes, yes it is. - Don't, don't. We can say that time's behind us. We've had years together. Yes. I can tell you about a thousand wonderful hours we spent together, because I feel we would have, inevitably. And there's not much difference between the future and the past. Not if you feel this way about it, no. - Shouldn't we wake him? - What good would it do? None. You're right. It's only seconds, darling. Try not to be afraid. Floyd... I'm not afraid anymore. Something happened, like a great wave, carrying us up, baring us. Protecting us. - Dr. Fleming? - Yes? The men from the news syndicates are still waiting. Alright, let them come in. Dr. Fleming, the pilot and crew of flight 19, International Airlines, observed a strange object falling over Nova Scotia. According to their reports, it could have been the R-X-M. My office has been getting the same story over the wires for hours. We know the R-X-M has been overdue for a long time. Is there any connection, Doctor? As yet, there has been no confirmation, but... Yes, I believe there is a connection. Then, they all perished in the crash? No, two were lost earlier. But the flight must be considered a failure. A failure?... Every point of our rocket theory has been established. Its proven that inter-space travel is not only possible, but practical! And it has supplied us with information... Which may well mean the salvation of our own world. No, gentlemen... The flight of the R-X-M was not a failure. Tomorrow we start construction of R-X-M 2. The distance between the Earth and the Moon, at its closest proximity, is 238,000 miles. We expect to cover this distance in approximately 48 hours. X minus 5 seconds. Zero! - 90 degree turn completed! - Reduce power. Thrill, as you get a Moon's eye view of Earth! Streak though a barrage of hidden dangers! Meteorites! - Twenty five thousand! - Prepare to jettison tail section. You ready? Go! Reduce power. Look out!
