[**] BELINDA: Back before the Revolution, the land that's now called Mount Hope was a wedding present for the daughter of an English shipbuilder. Back then it was where warships were made. But it became the place where city families would come for their summer vacations. One of the main attractions was the shore dinners, the big platters of fresh fish and boiled corn, that according to tradition have to be eaten within sight of the ocean or it isn't a real shore dinner. And that's where Lobsterville comes in. My great-grandparents, Eddie and Sheila Keating, started the restaurant in 1933 with nothing more than a bushel of clams and a case of whiskey. Their son, my grandfather, Jimmy Keating, took it over, and today there is a restaurant and a wholesale fish business, Keating and Daughters, that's run by my mom and dad and my mom's sister, Nora. T.J.: Belinda. Coming swimming or what? Aunt Nora's waiting. BELINDA: T.J., you just interrupted our family history. Shut that thing off. BELINDA: Whoa, is that a zit? You better erase that. Stop it. You coming or what? Where's Josie? I thought you were watching her. Guess not. She wanted to stay with Mom. Big surprise. Wait up. MAN: Careful, Josie. [**] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] MAN: Hey. [MAN & WOMAN CHUCKLING] [CASSIE LAUGHS] Don't tell me that I'm being tough on you. No, that's the price of scallops. Well, you do remember supply and demand, don't you? Actually, Benny, I'm doing you a favor. Mom! [GROANS] [CHUCKLES] No, not you. Sorry. Josie just jumped on me. What? Mom. Wait a minute, honey. Wait. Okay, okay. Uh... Let's just split the difference and we'll call it 7.50 a pound? Okay. Yeah, of course I'm good at this, Benny. That's why you can't say no to me. [CHUCKLES] All right, so we have a deal? Good, good. So long. Look, Mom, look. CASSIE: Uh-huh. Someone's coming home. [BOAT HORN BLOWS] Josie. Josie, look at me. Tell me who is coming home? I home, Mom. I... Daddy. Yeah. [CHUCKLES] [HORN BLOWING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Morning, Cass. Hey, Bill, Barbara. Hey. Andy, hi. Hey, John. Nice to see you. Cass. Hey, welcome back. How's the run? So-so. We caught more of them then they got of us. Well, you are a glass-half-full kind of guy, Bobby. So where's my tall, dark and handsome one? Well, you finally came to your senses. I was talking about the other one, the one that I'm married to. Ouch! [CASSIE LAUGHING] Billy headed off that way a few minutes ago. Well, tell him that I... I took the truck to the market, and I'll be back in a little while to pick him up. BOBBY: Okay, Cass. And you, John Bernard, you stay out of trouble. [**] [GASPS] Where'd you come from? Your dreams. [CHUCKLES] My dreams don't usually give me goose bumps. Yeah, that's probably just the ice cream. [CHUCKLES] [MOANS SOFTLY] Maybe we should get out of here. Okay. Okay. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO] This has gotta be illegal. No, this isn't. But this is. [GASPS] [LAUGHS] Oh, it's cold. [CHUCKLES] Honey... [BILLY & CASSIE LAUGHING] Oh. Oh! Mrs. Urkel. Mr. Madearos. Did she see? Yeah. Oh, wait. She just peeled out to call the police. Liar. [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] How come we never do this at home? Because we're too old and respectable. Besides, the truck wouldn't fit in the bedroom. [CHUCKLES] MARY: Well, I don't think it's such a bad idea, that North Point School. No way, Mom. I was talking to one of the teachers in the restaurant-- [SIGHS] I don't want her stuck with the special-ed kids. Well, she seemed really nice. Too bad that hearing implant didn't work. Well, it didn't. And Josie is going to first grade, just like everyone else. She does not need to learn sign language. You sold to Benny for 7.50 a pound? Since when have we become the Salvation Army? And a fine hello. You wanna take back the wholesale business? Be my guest. It turns out we're getting the best price on the wharf, so anytime you wanna thank me... Yeah, yeah, but 7.50 a pound? Hardly pays to send the boats out anymore. Papa. Hey! Hello, my little angel. [JOSIE GIGGLES] I guess it pays to be 5 and adorable. Well, she's not trying to run me out of my own business. Oh, Jimmy, stop being hysterical. Besides, Lobsterville is not a business, it's a tradition. And you can't be run out of a tradition. Oh, your cockamamie idea of tradition here is based on sleepless nights and hard work. Mainly mine. BOBBY [OVER RADIO]: Mayday. MAN 1: Mayday. This is the Aurora. Come in, Coast Guard. Mayday. That's Mike's boat. MAN 2: This is the Coast Guard. Come in, Aurora. MAN 1: The captain's down. He had a serious heart attack Oh, my God, it's Mike. MAN 2: What's your location? MAN 1: Forty-three klicks out. We need a medevac chopper. We need paramedics. [CHURCH BELL TOLLING] [**] If there's anything we can do... I'm so sorry. I can't help thinking about all the men we've lost in the last few years, but... Mike Speros. [SCOFFS] Hell, he should have retired years ago. It's too much stress out there. It's not the kind of work for old coots like us. I should retire. Oh, yeah, right, Dad. You got the constitution of a bull. Well, even bulls get old, Cass. You know, I was thinking... now that the Aurora has no captain, if I sold it and laid off the rest of the crew... that could cut insurance costs by-- Downsize the fleet? No, Dad, no. We don't downsize. Times are tough, Cass. You do what you have to do. Times have been tough before. You know that. It doesn't mean we go backwards. JIMMY: You have a better plan? [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Maybe. How about John Bernard? Better than you. [CHUCKLES] BILLY: You stole my first mate? CASSIE: Oh, I didn't steal him. A promotion isn't stealing. Besides, I only recommended John for the Aurora. You could have told me, at least. I find out a week later through the grapevine. Jeez, Cass. Dad. CASSIE: Well, it isn't "official" official. Dad's gonna wait until the Fisherman's Quarterly. What's this "official" official? Everybody knows except me. Dad. And I'm his captain. Was. Dad. CASSIE: Oh, that's what this is about. Competition, isn't it? You and John. Oh, for God's sake. Dad. Hang on a second, T.J. CASSIE: Ever since Pop Warner, you've been one step ahead of John Bernard... in everything, until now. Now you're both captains. That's brilliant. That's ab-- When did K-Mart start handing out degrees in psychiatry? [CHUCKLES] Sorry, T.J. This is beautiful. Really, this is great. Like I want it? I made it for you. [WAILS] Hey, you-- BILLY: T.J., I said I liked it. Will you put that thing down? [CRYING] I know, are you okay? It's okay. Oh, don't look at me like it's my fault. It's all right. [GULLS CAWING] [BOAT HORN BLOWING] [PEOPLE LAUGHING, CHATTERING] How are you? Nice to see you. Well, you made it to the Quarterly. He says that every time. Will somebody please tell me when this became an optional deal? Hey, hey, will you look at this? Your other daughter brought a date. MARY: Oh, my. [GASPS] He actually looks respectable. CASSIE: Mm-hmm. Who is he? MARY: I don't know. He's not from here. Well, obviously. She's already been through all the local guys. Now, Cassie, don't embarrass your sister. All right. Nora, well, look at you, all decked out. Willis, this is my sister, Cass, and her husband, Billy. Hello, nice to meet you. And my mother, Mary Keating. Nice to meet you. Welcome. This is Willis Randecker. Check it out. Your Aunt Nora dug up a hunk. I bet you 10 bucks he's already married. She wouldn't do that. Nora's explained to me your Fisherman's Quarterly. I understand I'm crashing a time-honored tradition. That's all right. You can't scratch yourself around here without it being some tradition. [CHUCKLES] What? Well, it's true. Well, Willis is up here looking at some of our Yankee land. Ah. You're not working for the jerk who's developing Blue Moon Point, are you? No, ma'am. I am that jerk. Nice work, Cass. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] [SILVERWARE CLINKS ON GLASS] Can we all take our seats, please? Uh, nice to meet y'all. JIMMY: Dinner and the Fisherman's Quarterly are about to begin. Belinda. T.J. What? Well, the fishing business has taken a lot of hits in the last few years. I don't have to tell you that. [PEOPLE MURMUR] In fact, we're in a struggle to survive the likes of which this company hasn't seen since my father, God bless his soul, and my mother, Sheila, started up the Keating fleet years ago. Fisheries have closed, our waters have been depleted by over-fishing, grumbling over international quotas. By God, I'll tell you something, though. this is a tough-ass business. But tough times or not, fishing is what we do. WOMAN: Hear, hear! JIMMY: Right? [ALL CHEERING] And I-- I wanna thank you... the men and the wives of the Keating fleet, for looking these tough times straight in the eye. You're the best in the world. [ALL CHEERING] Thank you. Thank you. Now, uh... I have one more bit of business. [FAKE SNORES] [ALL LAUGH] There's always one. [ALL CHUCKLE] That you old gossips already know, I'm sure. So give me a hand for the new captain of the Aurora, John Bernard! [ALL CHEERING] [WHISTLES] Yeah! Hey, Johnny! Congratulations. Oh! Oh! [ALL LAUGH AND CHEER] John! MARY: Well, she's serious about this Willis guy. Haven't you noticed? She's even quit smoking. I think Nora was born smoking. He's a land developer. How could she be serious about a guy who takes people's homes and turns them into malls? And makes everybody rich in the process? Gee, I don't know. Beats me. Anyway, she is, and he just might get serious back if you keep your big mouth out of it. Nora's still furious with you. CASSIE: Well, she can get in line. What did you do to him? Nothing. He's still sulking over John's promotion. And he's mad because I kissed him... even though he won't admit it. When's he going out again? Don't worry. We'll make up before he goes out. We always do. [**] [TIRES SCREECHING] [SCREAMS] Josie! Josie. Josie? She's okay, isn't she? Oh, Josie, are you okay? Is she okay? Oh, she's okay. She's almost deaf. I've been telling you we ought to put up a road sign. MARY: It's not another sign we need, it's safer drivers. Josie. Josie. Oh! You're okay. [**] SHEILA: Eddie. Don't go, Eddie. [**] [GIRLS LAUGHING, CHATTERING] Sheila. Do I know you? No. I mean, not yet. I didn't think so. Wait. Take this. It's for you. How did you know? The same way I know you're gonna marry me one day. I don't even know your name. I'm Eddie Keating. Now you know. Don't go, Eddie. She didn't hear us, honey. Ara... [GASPS SOFTLY] Look who's come to visit. Mmm! We were at the speech therapist. We thought we'd stop by, see what you were up to. Well, it was the jitterbug all morning. The usual. [CHUCKLING] Yeah. [LAUGHS] And how's Josie? Mm, the same. The therapist said her speech would improve if we would just talk to her more, but I can't seem to get Billy to do it. He thinks that I baby her too much. Maybe you do. He acts like he's afraid of her. Oh, Billy's not afraid of Josie. No, not "afraid" afraid. It's just... Anyway, we end up in the same fight. How come no one tells you that marriage is just one endless déjà vu? I read in one of those magazines that a marriage today is 90 percent work. The only thing is, the other 10 percent, you're asleep. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Funny... I don't remember it being that way when Eddie was alive. Oh, Gram, that's what I want. A life with no second thoughts. I want a marriage like yours. Mm, you better be careful what you wish for, Cass. [**] [**] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] MAN: Another Fourth of July, looking forward to it. Where are the clams? No scrimping on the clams. That's the secret. Besides, what's the worst that could happen? Dad sells out and we all make money. You and Billy could buy your own boat. I don't want a boat. And I don't want us to start our own operation. Oh, Cass, you've wanted that since high school, a big rig named after you. Well, yeah, but that's a kid's dream. And besides, she built this place up from nothing. We can't just sell out. All right, all right. Don't get all nuts on me, okay? People talk. Maybe Dad's just being polite to Willis. It wouldn't kill you to be a little nicer to him. Dad doesn't talk just to be polite. Willis is a land developer. He's just gonna swoop in here... Doesn't mean he's trying to convince Dad to develop our wharf. Yeah, right. That's like saying sharks don't wanna eat little fish. Willis is not a shark. And besides, just maybe he's swooping in here for some other reason. Like maybe me? Did that ever occur to you? CHEF: All right, a couple pounds of butter. [SIGHS] [**] MAN 1: It's all iced down. MAN 2: Right on. [MEN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Hey, George. Here for the festivities? Wouldn't miss her. Got that rig you were asking after. Yeah? Just up from Florida. She's got a good price on her. Are you sure you're ready for this? Florida, huh? She ready for our winters? She'll eat up our Nor'easters. I outfitted her myself. [CHUCKLES] We're hanging on with spit and duct tape down there. When are you gonna talk to Jimmy about the repairs these boats need? You talk to him. You're a captain now. Besides, as soon as your boat's ready, this won't be your problem anymore. I'm sorry. I got a lot on my mind. Trouble at home? No, home is fine. Thinking about getting my own rig. Going out on my own. [LAUGHS] Oh, boy, I don't know. You stop fishing for Jimmy, his daughter's gonna kick your ass out of bed. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Anyway, she wants a boat, same as me. Always has. Your own boat. [**] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [CLEARS THROAT] [SNIFFLES] Uh, sorry. I just thought... Thought maybe I could get you something. Or, uh... No, I'm okay. [SNIFFLES] Don't you ever like to just be bummed? I don't know, I guess. It's just all that... life's a bitch and then you die. Blah, blah, blah. So, um... what are you doing here? Some kind of fireworks fan? Uh, no, it's just... sort of, uh... They own the restaurant, my family. So that your little sister? The little-- Deaf girl? I think she's cute. Look, if you want, I know a place we could watch the fireworks from. I mean, I know it's... It's sort of lame... but it's sort of a secret spot. Really? CASSIE: You too. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, Bernard, any special fireworks this year? I have a favorite. But you have to wait and see like everyone else. Oh, come on. How am I gonna know? [CHUCKLES] You'll know. [POPPING] [ALL CHEERING] Look! Oh, they're fabulous. Oh, I love this, Billy. I love it the same way every year, I love it. [CROWD WHISTLING, APPLAUDING] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [FIREWORKS WHISTLING] Oh, look. CASSIE: What? Oh. [ALL EXCLAIM] [LAUGHS] [CROWD APPLAUDING] WOMAN [OVER PA]: Price check, aisle four. MAN [OVER PA]: Check okay on three. [GIRL LAUGHS] Look. Hey, you're the deaf girl, aren't you? * Deaf girl, deaf girl Deaf girl, deaf girl * [BOTH GIGGLING] CASSIE: There you are. I was wondering where... Oh! Whoa, excuse me. Oh. John Bernard. I hope that you can steer your boat better than this. Not much. But I got a lot more room out there. [BOTH CHUCKLE] MAN [OVER PA]: Manager... Ice cream, Mom. Oh. Uh, you happen to have our favorite ice cream there. Ahh... Hey, Josie, is this your favorite ice cream? Better than chocolate? Can I give it to her? [SOFTLY] Yeah. Do you want this one? I'll give it to you. Okay. MAN [OVER PA]: Open up another checkout counter, please. MAN: Okay. Come on. That's got it. Leave it for tomorrow, guys. Will do. I wanna go home so bad it hurts. Don't have to say that twice. Saw the sign? What's the deal? The town. They said it's safer. You all right? Yeah. Did Josie see it? I told her it says she's special. [**] Come home early tonight, okay? Mom, special delivery for you. Flowers. Hey, what are you guilty about? Belinda, would you go tell T.J. dinner's almost ready? BELINDA: T.J.! Who says I'm guilty? Maybe it's a celebration. Mm. [JOSIE GRUNTING] Could you go check, see what's wrong? Yeah. Hey. BELINDA: T.J. What is it, sweetie? Hey, what's the matter? T.J., dinner's ready. [CRYING] So I saw George Knickle today. Mom. Belinda, don't yell. Go get him. Sweetheart, what's the matter? Tell Daddy. Talk slower. Let her read your lips. Well, I'm trying, but she won't. Sweetheart, let me see. Then check her hearing aid. Maybe the batteries are dead. Okay. Sweetie, wait, hold still. I can... Just let... No, it's... Let... Here, let me. Would you go stir that? Josie, let me. Let me. Let me. BELINDA: Earth to T.J. Calling T.J. Mom, he's not here! T.J.! [**] [DOOR OPENS] T.J., dinner! Isn't that better, Josie? He was in the basement. What's in the basement? Just playing darts. Darts? Get any bull's-eyes? How's your friend Alison? Have you seen her? Just give me a break. Go figure. It's love. Can't you see that? I was the same way once. We should get those flowers in water. Oh, oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, I got it. Hey, did you hear that John caught 10 tons of haddock? First time out. Well, they're running now. It's no big deal. But that sounds like a lot. [SCOFFS] What? I'm just trying to make conversation. Since when do we need to make conversation? What? Is it me? [CHUCKLES] BELINDA: Grandpa Eddie and Grandma Sheila. When was this taken? CASSIE: Right before he died. Uh, 1939. Geez. And his boat sank when he was only 40? That's Dad's age. Boats are built much better these days. [LAUGHING] Look at this one. Sheila at Lobsterville when it was only a little shack. I hope you guys are all sitting down. Miss Punctuality makes her entrance. Well, start practicing this: Mrs. Willis Randecker. [GIRLS GASPING] I'm getting married. [GIRLS EXCLAIM] [GIGGLES] MARY: Oh, my good God, Nora. Oh! Oh, look, Mom, look. Let me see. Oh! Are you pregnant? Mom! For your information, we haven't even done it yet. Says he won't unless we're legal. Must be some kind of Southern thing. BELINDA: Oh, congratulations. NORA: Thank you. That's not what you say. You say "good luck." Oh, whatever. Cassie, you wanna see it? You're gonna marry him. He's the one who put this whole idea into Dad's head. He wants us to sell out. Cass, don't spoil this. Me spoil it? All I'm trying to do is to hold on to our tradition. Oh! Running this business! It's what our family does. It's what holds us together! I am just trying to keep things the way they're supposed to be! NORA: Look around you, Cass. A lot of things aren't the way they're supposed to be. I know that. Everybody doesn't marry their childhood sweethearts. Husbands drop dead of heart attacks. That is not what I'm talking about. Little girls get sick and lose their hearing. [**] And, you know, no matter how hard you hold on to some... notion of tradition, life isn't gonna be the way you want it. So why don't you just let go and let me live my own life! And try for once, Cass, to be happy with what you've got. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] [INHALES SHARPLY] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Stand a little bit closer, Grandma Sheila. [SHUTTER CLICKS] You're not gonna cry on us when you give us your toast, are you? Oh, stop picking on me, girl. A man has every right to get a little emotional when he's announcing his last daughter's engagement. Okay. Oh, oh! [LAUGHS] Cass. It probably took a act of Congress, but I don't care. I'm just happy you made it. She's floating. Look at her. Congratulations. Thank you! She's never floated before. I think she's happy being here, surrounded by y'all, celebrating in your restaurant. Of course, you'd like to see the place torn down for condos. Because that's what land developer sharks do. Ah, Nora's got a big mouth. Look, I'm not gonna waltz in here and start something that'll upset Nora's family. Being Southern doesn't mean being stupid. Come on, Willis, I heard you were looking at the books. If he wants my advice, I'll give it to him. Advice, or just some pie-in-the-sky talk about how rich we're all gonna be. And how selling out is better than hanging on to something we've worked for all our lives. Cass, you're as stubborn as your old man. Mom. Oh, hi! I roped T.J. into looking after Josie for a minute so you can help me with the lobsters. Okay. Excuse us. Cass. Mm-hmm. Now, Josie, you're gonna stay with T.J. Mom. And I'll be back. I will be back. Mom. I'll be back. Josie, I'll be back. Mom. Josie. Josie! Josie! Let's go see what Dad's up to, okay? Come on. So, what happened with the boat? Did you buy it? [INHALES SHARPLY] [CHUCKLES] [LAUGHS] I bought it. How'd Cass like the surprise? Don't tell me you haven't told her yet. Ah, yeah, that probably wasn't one of my better ideas. [BELL RINGING AND ALL CHEERING] Hey! Josie! [GASPS] No! CASSIE: No! Josie. Josie, come on! Josie! Why won't she--? I'm sorry, you have to stay there. No, I need to be with her. Cass, it's all right. Don't yell, Mom! [EXHALES SHARPLY] I never should've left her with you! Stop that! What? In case you haven't noticed, you got more than one kid. T.J., this is not-- T.J. We're closing the ward for the night. Mrs. Madearos? Are you okay? When she was a baby, she got sick. After three kids, you get used to it... so I didn't panic. I... I just treated her like I treated the others when they got colds. Only it wasn't a cold. The doctor called it rubella. I think because it sounds nicer than German measles. Maybe if I'd been more careful then... maybe she could have a normal life now. She tries so... So hard, this little girl. Nobody knows... how hard she tries. Feel better? You know Mom didn't mean what she said. I... I... I think sometimes she doesn't hear her own words. She's deafer than Josie. Oh, now, come on, Teej. [SIGHS] How's she doing? She's asleep. The doctor says she may have to stay in for a few days. And that she may lose more of her hearing. They won't know until... [CRYING] I feel like I can't protect her enough. [SNIFFLING] Mm, you can't protect any of them enough. [SIGHS] Is T.J. still mad at me? Yeah, he'll get over it. That's what families do. [SIGHS] There's something I gotta tell you. Probably not the best time, but, um... I bought George Knickle's boat. You signed the papers, everything? I wanted to surprise you. You spent our whole life savings without telling me. You surprised me. Cass, I did this for us. This has been our dream forever! Forever ago we didn't have three kids. Jeez, Billy, it's one thing to dream when you're young, but what kind of time is this for you to go off on your own? You know, you could just try believing in me. Even Dad is thinking about selling out, after three generations. Right. Right. And if he does, what happens to me, huh? Oh! Become a condo manager? Crew for some other... No, don't walk away from me! Look, just... Just think about this. We don't know what's gonna happen with your dad, so now, we got our own future. [**] [CASSIE SIGHS DEEPLY] [ALARM BEEPING] [BEEPING STOPS] [DOOR CLOSES] You guys ready? Visiting hours are in 20 minutes. I'm ready. Aren't you coming? I got stuff to do. Please? For Josie? T.J., I'm sorry. I was panicked and I didn't mean to... You were brave to try and stop her. A lot of good it did. Come on, T.J. She wants to see you. Just because you're mad at me, don't take it out on Josie. Josie? Josie? You know, maybe I got other things on my mind! I can't say the right thing. I just... [SIGHS] Well, I'm off. Not even gonna say goodbye? I'm counting to 10. Look, I'm going out for a week. You can't be mad at me. You know those old wives' tales. Yeah, poof, it's all better. All right, well... That's for Josie. Sorry I won't be here to help her home. I know as soon as you leave, they'll be a hundred things I wished I'd said to you. That's good, right? [ENGINE STARTS] Well, then, I love you too. [SIGHS] ZACH: "How are you?" Fine. "I love you, Mama." Good, good. This is "bad, bad." CASSIE: Excuse me. Who are you? Look, Ma. You must be Mrs. Madearos. I'm Zach. Zach Butler. What are you doing? Ask Josie. She's saying, "I love you, Mama." Can I talk to you for a minute, please? Hey, Josie, look what we brought. Josie, look at you. So who are you and who gave you permission? I'm a speech therapist. The hospital asked me to come in and take a look at Josie. Really? No one asked me. Well, that's bureaucracy. Yeah. Mrs. Madearos, your daughter, she's an amazing little girl. She's picking it up just like this. My daughter's not going to learn sign language. She's not deaf. Not completely. But with her level of hearing impairment, signing could really make a difference in her life. No. Sign language will just set her apart from other kids. I'm not gonna allow that. It's gonna help her, on her terms. Now, if she were a candidate for aural implants, it might be a different story, but she isn't. The sooner she learns to sign, the more fluent she'll be. Fluent? With who? We don't know sign language. Fluent in a world where she's not the outsider who can't hear. All I'm saying, Mrs. Madearos, is maybe you ought to let Josie decide. Now, you don't wanna harm your kids with good intentions. My kids are fine. Thank you. [**] [TIRES SCREECHING] [COUGHS] Whoa! Mmm! You're gonna pass it! Oh! T.J.: This is where you live? Wow. It's like some kind of museum. Beautiful on the front, hell inside. Like me. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Mister-- Mistress of Agony. Mistress of Agony. [LAUGHS] C'est moi. Cool. [CHUCKLES] Say what? [LAUGHS] [GASPS] [RETCHES] [COUGHING] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [SCOFFS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] CASSIE: Thanks. I hope you'll reconsider, Mrs. Madearos. I'd really like to keep working with her. Josie? Get in the car now. Thanks, but I doubt we'll-- Mr. Madearos. Oh, no, he's not my husband. Thanks. I... Daddy's working, honey. John is gonna take us. Ice cream. Ice cream, that's right. [CHUCKLES] Anything you want, Josie. Bye, Josie. [FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING STAIRS] [SIGHS] She'll go to sleep now. Yeah, she seems good. They're pretty resilient, aren't they? Most of the time. [SIGHS] This Zach guy, oh, he's got some nerve. I don't know. Look, it's none of my business, but... maybe it does open up a whole range of possibilities for her. I mean, we hear okay. So how do we know? Do you see her face when she makes a word? What? I just... Nothing. [CHUCKLES] You are... [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] Thanks. What? It means "you're welcome," I think. I was reading. You're tired. I should be going. Thank you. John Bernard. Anything, Cass. [DOOR CLOSES] Dad. What are you doing here so late? I might ask you the same question. I was restless, so I came up here to see what was going on. Everybody's already packed up and gone already. [CHUCKLES] Thanks. What does that make me, furniture? No. That makes you just what the doctor ordered. [SIGHS] [SIGHS] How's Josie? She'll be fine. Belinda's babysitting, and I don't know what's going on with T.J. You know, Cass, I've been thinking about this sign-language business... and I hear that speech guy has been working with Josie. I just hope you stick to your guns about this thing. You know, every once in a while these people come in to the restaurant, and they're-- They're with the fingers going a mile a minute. And, you know, there's something freakish about it, I-- Dad, people with handicaps aren't freakish. I know. But I just, you know, there's no reason for Josie to get mixed up in that. Because then she'll be freakish? No. Don't get all in a tangle. You and I used to agree about this. And, well, maybe I've been thinking about it too. And maybe it isn't normal for her to try to... To speak on our terms. [SIGHS] Dad, you should see her face when she signs a word. And maybe Mama's right, maybe... if she went to the North Point School, then-- Then she wouldn't stand out at all. She wouldn't be freakish to anybody. You sure picked a fine time to change your mind about that special school business. What with Billy defecting and all. How are you gonna afford this? Billy defecting? Dad, you're the one who's in cahoots with Willis to sell off this place. Did you barge in here just to yell at me or what? No. No, I came up here to find some peace and quiet, and obviously I made a mistake. [DOOR CLOSES] [SIGHS] Hey. Hey. What are you doing down here? [SIGHS] Don't ask. [GROANS] Could things get any worse? I could give you some pretty lousy whiskey. [CHUCKLES] Okay. [SIGHS] I can promise you I'll be lousy company. It's a big boat. I'll just ignore you. [LAUGHS] Sounds perfect. Someone should just hang a sign on me "Grouch alert. Proceed with caution." Oh! Whoa! [**] I'll take my chances. [SOFTLY] John Bernard. [INHALES DEEPLY] Oh, my-- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. I want you, Cass. John, that's not-- It is. I can't. [SIGHS] [SIGHS] Oh, God. All right, guys, I'll see you later on. Dry it off, come on. Dry it off. You got it. This is a surprise. What? What's going on? Is Josie all right? No, Josie's fine. She's at home. She's fine. Oh. Well, then what did I do to deserve limo service? I'm sorry. Well-- For what? For fighting. For everything. Oh, you. [BILLY SIGHS] So, what did I miss? Nothing. The usual. A whole week, no excitement? Nora doesn't wanna get married in Lobsterville. I suspect she'll elope. Mom and Dad are really upset, and suddenly she... She says that she just doesn't wanna make a big deal out of it. A big break in tradition. Yeah. I never see T.J. anymore. The new girlfriend. Ah, hey, it must be serious. BILLY: All right, close your eyes. CASSIE: Am I supposed to pretend to be surprised? Cass. Cass, come on. This is, this is the big moment. [CHUCKLES] All right. [LAUGHING] Billy. What? Oh! Remember what you said the first time we wished on stars? [**] My name on your boat. Our boat. [CHUCKLES] I'm gonna make this work for us, Cass. I promise. [CHUCKLES] Hang on. We gotta christen her. [SIGHS] Has T.J. been taking the truck? But you can't be going with some other guy. Don't be so immature. What, because he's a senior, that makes me immature? The point is, you don't own me. I don't wanna own you. I love you. Stop saying that. It's sick to love somebody that much. You just scare them. I gotta go. Alison. There he is. T.J. [SIGHS] Get in the truck. CASSIE: Drinking and driving. Are you out of your mind? You are grounded, pal. Grounded? How you gonna know? You're never around. Just get in the truck. Let's-- [DOOR SLAMS] She's trying to talk to you. I... That's nice, honey. Billy, she's trying to talk to you. Don't treat her like a puppy. I'm not. I just don't know what this means. What--? [JOSIE CRYING] Instead of making fun of her, you could learn. Learn what? It's okay, it's okay. I made an appointment for us at... At North Point. North Point? Cass. She's crying. That's right, kids cry. You want her to be normal, treat her like a normal kid and let her work it out. She's not normal. Look, she can't hear right, but she's as smart as a whip. Smart enough to know she can act like this and you'll run to her. You taught her that. There's such a thing as protecting her too much. I thought we agreed she wasn't gonna learn sign language. Why are you--? It's better for her. Says who? How am I gonna talk to her? We will learn to sign. If she can learn, we will learn. How am I gonna know what she's saying? My... My own kid. I mean, don't I get a say in all this? And what kind of say do you expect to have when you're never even home? Oh... [DOOR CLOSES] Let's not fight, Billy. Let's just try it. We'll meet the teachers this afternoon... and see how it feels. I can't. Not today. I didn't tell you, I'm taking the new boat out. Today? Today? You just got back. Well, the crew's all lined up. I can't back out. I don't believe this. You think she's gonna make money just sitting there in dry dock? Cass, come on, this is-- This is our life's dream. Yeah, and this is our life too! And what's happening with the restaurant, it's all our life, Billy. While you're not looking, it's just slipping right through our fingers. It's called change, Cass. It's not slipping. It's all just out of control. Well, that's change. Nora can get married anywhere she wants. Your dad can sell the business, we can go out on our own. This is what life's about. You might fall on your butt... but you gotta follow your instincts. Cass, it's okay. Yeah, yeah, maybe for you. No, for us. Why do you think I bought the boat? I don't know. Maybe so you could stay one step ahead of John. Who knows? How did he get into this? While you're out trying to prove you're the king of the hill, he's talking better with Josie than you are. And you're supposed to be her father. [**] I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that. The crew's waiting. I'll be back in a couple days. When I get married, this is how I want it to be. Rainy and gray and eloping with my true love. Oh, my hair is soaked! We're crashing Nora's wedding! I doubt your hair is gonna be the first thing she notices. [BOTH GIGGLING] [BELINDA SHUSHES] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [SHUSHES] [GIGGLING] Excuse me. You okay? Oh, yes. Not getting cold feet, are you? No, no. I'm-- I'm just... Well, it just seems a bit funny. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] BOTH: Surprise. Oh, gosh! We're here whether you like it or not. You're all wet. Well, that is the last time I ever tell you guys a secret. Oh, come in, come in, come in. Y'all don't even elope like normal people up here. [CHUCKLES] [THUNDER CRASHING] [**] [WIND WHISTLING] We're gonna see what she's made of tonight. Yeah. That we are. MINISTER: Let this love protect you and guide you. And now by the power vested in me by the state of Maine, I pronounce you husband and wife. EDDIE: Why are you crying? SHEILA: I hate the part when he said, "As long as you both shall live." It made me think of... Eddie, I couldn't bear it if-- My sweet bride, weren't you listening? I just vowed I'd love you forever. And forever is forever. CASSIE: Gram. Gram. What? What happened? We had a fight... and he left, he went out... before we had a chance to make up. He went-- He went out there. And I let him go when he was mad. Gram. [SOBS] It was so stupid. No. Shh. It's... It's just an old wives' tale. Shh, it's okay. [SNIFFLES] [**] [THUNDER CRASHING] [ALERT BLARING] It's the aft bilge alarm. --over. Go check the hold. I can't get through. Well, keep trying. Calling the Coast Guard. We're taking on water! [**] [THUNDER CRASHING] BOBBY [OVER RADIO]: Mayday. It's the Cassandra! Mayday! Coast Guard! This is the Cassandra. Come in, please. Mayday, Coast Guard, this is the Cassandra. [STATIC OVER RADIO] This is a mayday! [WIND HOWLING] Mayday, Coast Guard. MAN: This is the Coast Guard, over. Mayday, this is the Cassandra. Come in, please. Could we have an extra pump up there? No! Let's see how deep she is. Mayday, this is the Cassandra. Come in, please. [STATIC OVER RADIO] [BOTH GRUNTING] We're gonna die out here! No! No! Belinda, I've gotta hurry. If the restaurant calls, tell them I'm running an errand and I'll be late. Oh, and make sure T.J. remembers that he's grounded. He's not even to call Alison. BELINDA: Okay. See you later. [LOUD ROCK MUSIC PLAYS] [DOORBELL RINGS] [CLEARS THROAT] Are you gonna lecture me? No. I, um... I'm sorry. I... I had a talk with Billy. And I'm... I'm sorry. I think that I've been looking at things all wrong here, and... You're apologizing, huh? Yeah, believe it or not. Oh, Cassie. Oh! Congratulations. Thank you. Married lady, married lady. Yes, finally. [BOTH CHUCKLE] And you... Welcome to our family. Well, actually, we'll grow on you. [BOTH CHUCKLE] I believe that. [RINGING] Hello? [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO] No. It's all right. No! Josie, Josie. Josie. It's okay, it's okay. I'm sorry. T.J.! It's Daddy's boat! Well, I'll help you with Mom. She's not gonna let you get away without a party. No. You think Dad's gonna pass up his chance to cry? [LAUGHS] Dad? Hi. We were just talking about you. What is it? No. No. Daddy-- We got a mayday. [GASPING] The storm hit 'em hard, it... And Billy? We don't know. They're lost out there. That can't be. They said that the storm kept to the coast. That's what they... No! No, no! Cassie. It's all right. It's all right, darling. [SOBBING] It's all right. It's all right. [**] [PANTING] You got the extra flare? I got it. All right. MAN: Come on, let's move out. John? I'm sorry, Cass. Everybody's headed out to look for him. You're going out now? Yeah. Okay. T.J.: Wait! Wait! I'm going! I'm gonna find him. No! No, T.J., no! He's out there. I'm going! No, T.J., no! It's not a good idea. It can get pretty hairy out there. We'll do the best we can. But you can't. He's not your dad! Let him go. You mean it? Yeah. You bring your father home. Come on, we can't waste any time. Secure the line. Gavin! Tom. We'll find him, Cass. Oh, baby. Baby... [**] SHEILA: Something's wrong, isn't it? It's Billy. The Coast Guard found parts of his boat, but none of the crew. They wanna call off the search. [**] They've been searching for two days, just two days. Our own boats... Our fleet is coming in. Our fleet called it off. They're coming in too, Cass. No, they can't call the search off. Billy is out there. He is. He's alive. Yes! He can't be. Now, face this. No. No, no, I know it. You have to face this. Cass. I know he's alive, because I feel him! Cassie-- He's alive! I-- I feel him. I feel him! Please, Cassie. No. No. No, don't you look at me like I'm a widow. I am not a widow! Billy is alive! [**] Hey, T.J., why don't you come down? You gotta get some rest. Where is everyone? I don't even see the other guys. You didn't tell him everyone else went back last night? We're crazy to stay out here. The only thing you can do for Billy now is... Is to look after Cass. Put him on south-southeast. What did he say? Hmm? Oh, well, as a favor to us, Governor Hastings is gonna send a Coast Guard plane out again. But only for today. If they don't see any flares... then that's it. We're in the Gulf Stream. If he's alive, he'll be here. How do you know? The current he would've called when he lost control. I fished with the guy my whole life. Look for flares, T.J. It's the only way he can signal. [**] [HELICOPTER PROPELLERS WHIRRING] [EXHALES SHARPLY] [**] [CHURCH BELL TOLLING] [SOBBING] No. MARY: Cass. Where's he going? It's past time, T.J. No flares. It's over. You can't leave my dad out here. He's not out there, T.J. We would have seen something. He's still alive! He's my dad! Gavin. Christ, T.J., you're gonna set us all on fire. There's the flare. T.J.: He's seen it! He's coming back. Let's get back to work. [**] SHEILA: Won't you take me? Take me, Eddie. Something's wrong, isn't it? What could possibly be wrong? Eddie, what is it? I'm sorry. SHEILA: No. No, this isn't right. Take me. Don't take Billy. Take me. [WHISPERS] Take me... [**] MAN [ON RADIO]: Roger, out. Let's go. Due south. The Coast Guard spotted a raft! [**] There! There they are! JOHN: I can see two of them! Bear left! Dad! Dad! Hey! JOHN: Hey! Dad! Hey! Can you hear me? Dad! JOHN: Gavin, get the line! Dad! I think one of them is Bobby. JOHN: Come on, ease it forward. That's it. Come on. Dad! Dad? Get him out of here. No. What's wrong with my dad? Take him away! [**] Don't look so surprised. You said you wanted to go dancing, didn't you? You're taking me? It's time? JOHN: He's alive. Oh, God. T.J., he's alive! He's alive! Dad. Dad. [**] WOMAN: Is he alive? MAN: Give us some room, please. WOMAN: Is he alive? Oh, Billy. Billy. Oh, baby. I love you. [SNIFFLES] Hey. I'm okay. [**] Baby. It's okay. Come on, kids. I'll be okay. I love you. [**] Oh! Thank you. Now, I don't know what retirement's gonna be like. Mary promises it'll be like eating oysters. An acquired taste we'll learn to love after a while. [ALL LAUGH] One thing that's easy to get used to is... the daughter side of Keating and Daughters is now in charge, along with Billy and Willis. [ALL APPLAUDING] Boy... I-- I never thought I'd live to see the day when we'd have a Southerner minding our Yankee business. But-- But as I said, things change, you gotta go with the flow. There is one thing that won't change, though. Every now and then, all our rigs are docked at the same time out here. I walk the wharf on those nights... just to look at them, all lined up. It means our men have come home safe. It means all our families are whole again. It means that by the grace of God, we've been given... an honest day's work... and the chance at it again in the morning. No, I don't know what retirement's gonna be like, but I can tell you this. On those nights, I'll be walking this wharf... filling up on the idea that life is crazy, but... every now and then, right in the middle of it, things can be... just right. Oh, well, did somebody say something about dancing? If I don't hear some music pretty soon, I'm liable to jabber on until... [MUSIC STARTS PLAYING] Okay, don't be so blunt about it. [ALL APPLAUDING, LAUGHING] Come on, old coot, let's dance. All right, come on. How long are you gonna keep staring at me like I might disappear? About 30 or 40 years. Mmm. You might get sick of the scenery. That's not gonna happen, Billy. This looks good on you. You think she'd approve? I miss her. Yeah. Well, something tells me she hasn't gone far. It's that old Keating spirit, you can feel it. [CHUCKLES] You're still staring. Get used to it. [**] BELINDA: Smile. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] Smile. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] Smile. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] Smile. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] BELINDA: In the old days, Mount Hope was a very important city. It was where a lot of the ships were built for the English Navy. Today, of course, it's not the world capital of anything, really. Except it's where my family lives. And my family's family, and their family too. It's where we all live. And so you could say that Mount Hope is kind of the center of the universe. And that would be true. [**]
