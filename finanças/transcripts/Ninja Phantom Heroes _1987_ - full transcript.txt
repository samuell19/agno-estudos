(flute and drum music) Hi, I am Sho Kosugi. Today, I'd like to introduce a weapon called the tonfa. This weapon was created by farmers. It's very simple, but... Very effective. (cymbal ringing) Welcome to the Ninja Theater. I'd like to introduce to you one of the finest kung fu movies. I hope you enjoy it. (men groaning) 715, report to the commander. (suspenseful music) [Guard] 715, move it! Come on. [Prisoner Voiceover] Oh my God, it's Glenn. (dramatic music) [Blonde Soldier] Hurry up. You guys, over there, and you up there. Go on. Yes, sir. [Soldier] Come on. - Search! - Yes, sir. (guns firing) Come on. Follow me. - Nothing, sir. - OK, we'll carry on in two separate groups, come on. Don't feel too bad. Everybody makes mistakes. What's important is, you realize your mistakes and not repeat them. And you saved my life. Sergeant Glenn, I deeply regret my past behavior. You were good to me. If it wasn't for your plan of lenience, I'd have been court-martialed. I would have faced the firing squad. Don't talk crap! I didn't help you that much and you owe me nothin'. The army's been good to you, both of us, OK? So I hope you'll still serve your country and carry on working to overcome evil. I'll be gratified to see you back at the agency. Sergeant, thank you for giving me a second chance. You have the chance, but it's all up to you. For sure, I'll do my best. The CIA discovered that Morris has established a ninja organization in Hong Kong and is smuggling arms to the Middle East and making it even more unstable. Now your task, Ford, is to bring that traitor in. He must be brought to justice. But sir, how can I handle those ninjas? Hong Kong's an unfamiliar place to me. It'll be very difficult to take action alone. I'm afraid I can't complete the mission. Don't worry, I've arranged everything. We have someone to help you in Hong Kong. Her name is Christine, code name Yellow Bird. Your code name is Condor. You also have a secret password. Let me whisper it to you. When does the mission begin? That's confidential. Go and resume your normal duties. [Guard] OK, back you go. (ship's horn blowing) (lively pop music) - Master. - What is it? I just heard some gang is moving into the Middle East, organizing a deal to sell the Arabs Russian arms. That means they're gonna try and wreck our business, doesn't it? Hmm. Invite them to a cocktail party in the name of the local rich, then see how I'm gonna deal with them. This all-powerful syndicate, shits! (light music) Welcome, Mr. Wong. Please. I hate going to parties. Oh, it's all right. - Godfather. - Huh? Who's really hosting this party? I've got a funny feeling. Maybe it's a plot to kill us. Oh, we'll be careful. But I've got to put in an appearance or everyone will wonder where I am. It's an important party. Money, from wall to wall. This is the chairman, Mr. Chu. This is his wife, this is Mr. Woo, director and owner of Penta Shipping. (light music) - Oh, welcome, welcome. - Thank you, thank you. - Hello. - Hi. [Man] The boss is expecting you. Please come this way. Hey, how you doin'? Great, but not so good as you. (laughing) Ah, my friend. I'm so glad you could make it. It's good to see you, everybody would agree. Mr. Chan, Mr. Wong's here. Hi, Mr. Wong, it's great that you could come, yeah. (Chuckling) Glad to be here. We're all getting old now. Seeing all of these young people around me just reminds me of what I've been missing. It all seems like yesterday. Ah, there's life in the old dog yet. (laughing) (dramatic music) It's very seldom we get the opportunity to see you three together. We were all just saying, we're getting on a bit, you know how it is. (laughing) Well, if you're getting old, then I must be getting old too. (chuckling) Anyway, you must be getting older, but you're still successful in your business. (chuckling) Thank you. Cheers. Do we have to stay? (suspenseful music) Hey! (gun firing) (screaming) [Man] After him! [Man] Hold it! Huh? OK, take it easy. Just relax, everybody. It'll be all right. Well Mr. Chan. Is this your idea of a cabaret, you tell me! How dare you? It's nothing to do with me. Huh, don't give me that crap, it's just like you. You! You can take this as the end of our friendship. Easy now. OK, guys, go. (dramatic music) Huh. (sirens wailing) Go on. (suspenseful music) [Cop] Excuse me, sorry to delay you. But we're on duty, we've got a few questions to ask. [Man] Hmm. Godfather, we can't go. [Man] Ah, come on, we don't have all day, move it. Quick guys, the cops are coming! It's the best car in the world! It's not as good as the Porsche. Not as fast as if there will be. [Man] Ah, none of them are as fast as a bicycle. (laughing) Hey, look at that car, isn't it fantastic? It's beautiful. Look at that paintwork. (laughing) I wanna get one of those. - Yeah. - Oh sure. Huh? Hey, you guys, wait a minute, there's my friend in there! It's my friend, hey Alan, Alan! Hey, come back here, hey. - Come on, get back here. - Hey! Allan, Allan! He just ignoring me. And I know he recognized me. Well now, that's money for ya. He makes a bet, and then deserts all his friends. Well I don't blame him. I'll be rich too if I win the lottery, won't I? Here's to the good times. Yeah, yeah. Hey. It's empty. Huh, they're all empty, hey Fatty. - Huh? - Why don't you get some more. - Oh, I don't... - Go on, Fatty. - Piss off. - Go and get some beer. It's your turn. Come on, go on Fatty. Come on. - Baldy. - Hmm? Hey, having a good time? I could just use a cold beer. (Chuckling) What's up? Something wrong with your girl? Nah. What's the matter then? What's bothering you? There's nothing wrong, why do you keep asking? Hey, what's wrong with him? [Fatty] Baldy! Baldy! Baldy! What are you shouting about? Look like they're getting into trouble down there. (dramatic music) What? You can't refuse me, you bitch! Yes I can. I'm not letting you touch me, now get out! Give him his money back. - Just give him what he wants. - I will not. Get him out of here. You feel sorry for him, you give him what he wants. Here. Oh. I've paid my way. You must fuck, I'll make you do it. I pay you to protect me, get him out of here! Oh, go on, get out, you bastard! Get out of here! - Just calm down. - Get him out! Hey, what is it? That slob won't get out of here! Hey you! What do you want? Get out. Get out! Huh? Oh, you want to fight? Oh, oh my God! Come on, get him! OK. - Let me get him! - Get off. [Woman in Pink] Get out! Go on, get out of here! Don't come back! Go on. (shouting) - Let me at him. - He's not worth it. [Woman In Pink] No! Baldy. Why, I'll tell you. No, don't go. Alan, thank you for helping us. - Oh, it's all right. - We haven't seen that much of you lately. - Well, I've been very busy. - Oh, I see. (Chuckling) Well, thank you. - You want a quick drink? - Oh, sure. We're going for a drink. - Oh. - See you later! - See ya. - Bye. Hey, my jacket. Hey Alan, it's not easy. You think I like Dinny doing that kind of work? I don't have any choice. I can't get work. How much do you need? I don't want to know. Alan, you understand. I want to earn it. I want to work, not borrow, it feels wrong. It's not what it looks like. My work's not good, it can be dangerous. I don't think you'd like it. Baldy, you're much too honest. You'd really hate it. But I could try. You seem all right on it. That's true. But I'm indebted to the godfather. He took me as an orphan. And brought me up like his own son. So I owe him, I'm not free. I have to work for him. Baldy, I can't ever confront him with anything. I just do my job. He smuggles, and I obey him. You must understand. Keep your money, I don't want any handouts. Baldy, wait, Baldy! (ship's horn blowing) Is the condor hungry? (suspenseful music) The condor wants to hear the yellow bird sing. So you've come. Have you been waiting a long time? There's been trouble between the ninjas and bosses of the three main triads. So, it's an ideal time to act. I've got it, well let's go. [Christine] I'm ready when you are. You have any details about the case? I know that a certain Arab will come to Hong Kong to sign the arms deal. And that Chan and Wong are both determined to win that contract. Good morning, sir. Hey, you're early. What's on board? Nothing, just a social call. To see me, or to see Jane? Jane? You have a visitor. - Hi. - Hi. Come on. Come in. Please. [Jane] Daddy, you said smoking's bad for people. Well, he's a young man, come on take my seat. So what's new? What shall we do today? Anything, as long as we're together. Where shall we go, then? Hmm. You got any ideas? Can it be absolutely anything? Sure. What do you fancy? You'll find out. - You going out? - Mm-hmm. I'm just gonna change. Alan, I need to talk to you. Alan, I want you to talk to your father. Yeah sure, but what's the problem? Do you know how the three of us made our fortunes? Sure I know, you began in smuggling, during the war. That's when all the trouble started for us. We risked our lives on every trip. But your father and I weren't married. And your uncle was, so he used his family as a cover. Your father and I, we hid with the goods. Laying low and waiting. And then one day we were stopped by a patrol boat. The police opened fire on us, and all of Chan's family were killed. How's my father involved? The whole business had been your stepfather's idea. Ask him about it. Alan? I'm ready, we can go. Come on. We're not going horseback riding, are we? We certainly are. I can't go dressed like this. I'm not asking you to ride, come on. Why not have breakfast first? [Jane] No way. We're in a hurry. Bye! Bye. Dad, I'm going to the office. Right. (suspenseful music) (lively music) Mr. Chan, you don't think he'll back off. He will come, won't he? Hey, don't worry about it. (car honking) That sounds like him. He's coming now. That'll be his car. My boss is waiting for you. Yo. Hello. Ho, Go and introduce yourself. I'm just gonna change. - Morning, sir. - Morning, sir. Where's the Arab chap? I don't know. He should have called by now. Yeah, I know, I checked at this hotel, and he's not in his room. I've left a message for him. Also, I sent some guys to find him. Ah, Mr. Lee, please tell him I will guarantee his contract. He has nothing fear. Yes. (speaking foreign language) All right? Please sign. (chuckling) - Thank you. - Thank you. Please. Bye bye. Mr. Chan, you've done it. This million-dollar deal is all yours, congratulations. You've no competition. Yes, that's true. But what about Mr. Wong? What about him? Hey. I've done it on purpose to see his reactions. [Alan] Godfather. (telephone ringing) Yeah? I told ya, no more phone calls. No more calls! It's too much. I always treat you as a brother. It's never enough. Now you've taken the contract. It's got to stop! Alan. Go and take revenge. Teach him a thing or two! - Mr. Wong? - Do it now! But Mr. Wong, I really don't think... Shut up. I've decided. - Mr. Wong, I... - Come on! Hey Alan, come here. [Christine] It seems as if Wong arranged to sign with the Arabs, but Chan jumped in and did the deal instead. [Ford] Yeah, Wong must be furious. [Christine] No only Wong, Morris too. The local gangsters want a slice of the business now. And this changes everything. [Ford] You've done a good job, how do you know all this? [Christine] I'm a police officer. [Ford] OK, so what's next? [Christine] Chan is arranging for retribution in the form of some other Arab to come here and play hell. Also to introduce some kind of deal in firearms. Oh Mr. Ford, have you contact Morris yet? Let me think, Morris? Oh yeah, I remember him. Morris was my great buddy, you know. He persuaded me to sell ammo to the gooks over in 'Nam. We both betrayed our country. But he couldn't care less. (Morris laughing) - All clear. - All clear. (suspenseful music) - Over there. - Let's go. They'll be along in a minute, don't you worry. - Come on. - Come on. OK boys, help yourself. You're satisfied, they're OK? Good. They're just what we wanted. And we'll want more of the same next time. Very good, but how much will you pay? Joey, come over here. That good enough for ya? What's the matter, never seen gold before? I'm impressed. Next time you want weapons, just give me a week's notice. Mr. Ho, let me send a couple of guys to help you. No no no, I can do it myself. It's not safe, taking a gold leaf. I don't want any trouble, you see, I'll take it. Hey boss, let's kill him. We've got other business. I know I did wrong in the war. - It's all over now. - Thank god. - See you. - Yeah. The Arab will be here soon to talk about our arms deal. If we don't get rid of that freak who keeps following us he might wreck our deal. Where's the bastard? [Ford] Is anything wrong, why call me out in such a hurry? [Christine] I got some fresh information concerning the ninjas and I thought it couldn't wait. Sorry to disturb your Sunday. Well that's all right. Go ahead and shoot. Well, the Middle East will send some agents here to talk with the ninjas about the ammunitions deal. We got to do something to stop them. [Ford] Sure. We've got to be real cautious in future, as well. (suspenseful music) Come on. Hi. Now that we've exposed ourselves we'll have to be extra careful. You're right. And there'll be no problem with more ammunition. You can sell whatever you like. - But the price... - Sorry. The price is fixed by my head office, and I got a long-distance call this morning. I must leave tomorrow. You better decide today. Hey, what can we do? We'll have to wait a bit longer. If the price is fixed like he says it is, well, we don't have much time to think about it. Actually, if this deal goes through, Monsieur Chan will start bargaining. [Man] My boss said we'll have dinner tonight and then decide, hm? OK. Good bye. - Good bye. - Thank you very much. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - Where are you taking me? - Shut up! - Come on. - Move it. - Where am I? - Shut up. [Arms Dealer] What do you want? Let me go. Father, we've got him. [Godfather] Good, keep him tonight. Release him unharmed tomorrow. I got it. I know what to do. [Godfather] Alan, one more thing. Jane called for you urgently. What did she want? [Godfather] I didn't ask her. Listen, you guard him carefully. Good, very good. Albert, is Jane in? Albert, what's your game? I don't trust you. Why did you want Jane? What is she to you? What are you talking about? What do you want? I want an answer. What's with Jane? Stop it at once! What are you doing? Jane. Jane. What did you call me for, what's wrong? [Jane] You know full well. [Alan] No I don't. [Jane] I know you're just after me for my money. You don't really like me, just my name. That simply isn't true. You know how I feel about you. [Jane] Hmph, tell me. I can't take out my heart, huh? That sounds pretty weak to me. [Jane] Oh, go away. Eh, all right. It's not my business. But you are my sister. [Jane] It's not your business. OK. All right, Jane... Daddy. [Alan] Jane! Hi, Mr. Kwan. She's been spoiled rotten. Don't play up to her. Hey, give me a chance. Hmph! [Alan] Don't be so mean. [Jane] I'm not being mean. Taxi, taxi! Take me to the Royal Hotel, quickly, over there! But it's just over there. I know, the airport then. Hey! No, no! (crowd murmuring) Uh, something's wrong, something's wrong... Stop that man, get him! You're all irresponsible! Just a bunch of fools. (telephone ringing) Mr. Wong's. [Mr. Chan] Is Mr. Wong there? Who's calling? [Mr. Chan] Mr. Chan, don't you recognize my voice? It's Mr. Chan. Hello. [Mr. Chan] Hello, it's Chan here. What do you want? [Mr. Chan] Just a friendly phone call. Is that right? What's the reason? (laughing) You don't trust me. What a pity, my dear Wong. Actually, there is something. I've got a tape here. I thought you might like to listen to it. I'm sure you'll find it interesting. [Man] My name is Jim Bones. I'm a drug addict. I was paid to kill the foreigner. I was paid by Martin Wong and Alan Wong. [Mr. Chan] Will you testify in court? [Man] Yeah. I guess you heard that and understand it. You'd better get ready to go to jail. You'll like it. You'll have time to think about all that you're missing. You idiot! I warned you before, don't use drug addicts. What's going to happen to us now? Answer me. I'll tell you, you and me, we're going to jail. I will not go, I won't go to jail. Here, clean up your face. Oh, thanks. When you're feeling a bit better, we'll go out to eat. I'll look after you, Boney. Just don't mess me around. When I say I'll look after you, I mean every word I say. But you have to be reliable, and don't let me down. Oh, I won't, I promise you. (laughing) You better not. Here, Boss. [Mr. Chan] Now, tell the officer everything you told me, all right Boney? There's nothing to be scared of. (pop music) (suspenseful music) (pop music) Ah, this car's a heap of shit, I'm getting rid of it. Shame on you. The man from the Middle East is murdered. And our ammunition deal is broken. What do you think your brain's for, huh? We've already got Alan's death organized. Well you get it right this time. Yes, sir. (suspenseful music) [Driver] This is my boss, Boss this is Burt. - Hello. - Nice to meet you, Burt. And you, sir. But I don't understand. You have a first-class killer here. Why would you need to call me in? [Driver] I thought you were familiar with our rules, Burt. You ask no questions, and then you don't get into any trouble. Right, I remember. [Boss] Here, this is for you. Thanks. (gentle music) Alan. Hey, good to see you again. Your turn. It'd cost you ten bucks. Very good, you're still as strong as ever. [Burt] I got to do something to keep you on your toes. Life good overseas? Not bad, I prefer Hong Kong. Still in the game? I gave all that up while I was abroad. It was different. I do kitchen work, you can see from my hands, look. [Alan] Hey, you can't fool me with that. They've never washed the dishes. No way, spare me the bull. More beer! Cheers. [Alan] Hold on, wait for me. OK, cheers. [Burt] Where's Boney? Your cousin? Dead. He's dead? How come? He was murdered. Who did it? Me. Hmph, you expect me to believe that? He said you liked him, looked after him and helped him. You have to believe me. Mr. Wong, you're lucky Boney is dead. You won't face the law now. What are you insinuating? You're full of bullshit. I haven't done anything wrong. You are out of your mind. You... Bastard. Hey. Stop this arguing. It's useless. Let me act as mediator here. Your personal lives aren't the issue. We're here to discuss business. So we must keep our objectives clear. We mustn't let that Morris guy sway us off course. We must keep calm. (suspenseful music) Just put your personal differences aside. (men murmuring) Here comes our target. OK, this is it. What's the matter with you? Shoot him, get on with it. Alan, come with me. I'm busy right now. Fat Joe, that was meant for me, I'm not so popular. Boss, are you all right? Yeah, I'm OK. You explain it to the boss. Now way, I'm getting out. You tell him. You're an idiot, we had a deal with you. You agreed to it. You can't back out. Take the money. Give it to your boss. Are you out of your mind? Quite possibly. [Man] What am I supposed to say to him? Just whatever you like. Listen, it's not over, I'll get you. I'll pay you back. Listen you guys, when you see Burt, kill him on sight, no questions asked. Gotcha. (dramatic music) Burt. Alan... What happened? Tell me. I just come to say good bye. [Burt] Alan! Burt. Burt. Burt, what happened? They wanted to kill me. Who the hell or they, Burt? Who are they? Tell me Burt, I'll get them. Tell me who they are. - Never mind. - Tell me, Burt. Dad, you must be crazy. How could you agree to let Jane marry Alan? What can I do about it? She's a big girl now. Dad, you must realize, he only wants her money. Oh? What makes you think so? It's obvious, isn't it? He knows of our business problems. And with both of them together they'd be able to control us. You must've seen it coming. It's as clear as daylight. You don't understand. Too narrow. I've made up my mind and that's it. That's it? Dad, I see what you won't see. No more talk. I've had enough. Come in. [Glenn] What's your order, sir? How's the Condor plan going? [Glenn] Perfectly fine. That's not true, our Condor plan is becoming far too obvious. If we fail, our nation's reputation will be ruined. [Glenn] Why do you say that? Come with me and watch, you'll understand. (suspenseful music) (guests shouting) (guests screaming) It took too many lives, the case will turn into chaos if we keep getting involved in it. I understand how you feel, but if we keep our hands off, Morris will never be brought to justice. To deal with Morris, I'll think of some other plans, but first you've got to drop the Condor plan. Don't worry, we never lose. Let's see what happens. (Laughing) - Is everything organized? - Yes it is, you can go in. Good. Mr. Wong. - Albert, have a seat. - Thank you. You can leave now. - Thank you, sir. - Yes. Albert, what is it? What do you want? Oh, nothing, I just came to pay my respects to you. But I know you're a very busy man. Oh? Well, you are, and not only that, I wasn't sure you'd find time to see me. Such modesty. You know I like that in a young man. I'm glad sir, but there are others, like my late father, who don't agree. Yeah, that was a nasty business, it made me very sad. If you need anything, please just ask. Well that's very kind of you. But you've got it the wrong way around. I'm not in trouble, you are. That Chan is climbing to success at your expense, Mr. Wong. [Mr. Wong] Yeah, I know it, he's already taken the Middle East contract. He must have some powerful allies. Yes, he has. (suspenseful music) He knows who wields the power. Well who are these people, then? - Myself. - Huh? (dramatic music) You... Boss, you... (dramatic music) Master, what happened? Hey, come on! (men shouting) Mr. Wong! Quick, call a doctor! He's been shot. Call an ambulance. Let me through. Godfather, Godfather! What happened! We don't know. Godfather, tell me. Come on, tell me who it was. I'll kill him. I'll kill him! Albert. Godfather, Godfather! I'll kill him! No, stop! I'll kill him! Let me go! (laughing) Well done, Albert. Congratulations. How does it feel, now you've become the big boss? Good, I'm sure. (Laughing) Thank you for your help, sir. Oh, you must take all the credit. Let us oldies sit back. (Laughing) But you have the experience. Oh, cheers. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. (dramatic music) Hey. (guards shouting) Boss, there he is again. (guests screaming) (suspenseful music) Hold it. It won't work. I don't give a shit. I haven't come with life in mind. Albert, it's your death that I'm after. I've come to pay you back for killing Godfather. You dirty rat. Filthy, scum of the earth! Hmph. It's Alan, come on! Alan! Alan, get out of here! You got to get out of here, quick. Oh no, oh no... Oh my god! (gun firing) Fatty! Fatty! Fatty, Fatty! Fatty. Meatball. Don't die, don't die. Don't worry about me, just go save yourself. [Baldy] Fatty! (sirens wailing) Fatty! Baldy, come on. Baldy! Baldy, come on. Fatty! I'll avenge you! I'll avenge you! (suspenseful music) Hey, smoking makes you impotent, you know? Hey, keep a look out, I'm gonna nap. Someone's here. Stop the white car immediately. - Get out. - Get out. - Get out. - Move it. Alan! I'm gonna kill that bastard Chan! I'm gonna get him! Come here, come here you bastard! Let me show you! I'm gonna break your neck! Alan. Alan! Tell me straight, what's Morris' next move? I know everything, but promise me first, send me to the States. I promise, but you must make sure that Morris get to court, right? Follow me. Right. [Ninja] OK, go on. Hold it. (suspenseful music) Get away! (dramatic music) Come on! (suspenseful music) (laughing) You can't get away from me. (Morris laughing) Come on, let's go. (dramatic music) Help me! [Morris] You're a dead bastard! Oh, Ford. You OK? Yeah, thank you. Ha! [Ford] Christine. Hey! Hand Morris over to me, I'll take him. Why? It's an order, no questions. Hmph! Christine? I'll get him for this. Great, you've done a marvelous job. The death of Morris meant nothing to me. But I really feel pity for Ford. He was so capable. You bastard, all the way through you've been taking advantage of Ford, Morris, and me. In fact you secretly arranged to smuggle arms to the Middle East. (laughing) You're street-smart. You're assumptions are perfectly correct. It was an order from my superiors. What I do is execute orders, you can't blame me. The hell I can't! I quit! (gentle music)
